The alliance was made up of [[Bharatiya Jana Sangh]], [[Indian National Congress (Organisation)|Congress (O)]], The Socialist parties, and [[Charan Singh]]'s [[Bharatiya Kranti Dal]] representing northern peasant and farmers. Janata alliance, with [[Jai Prakash Narayan]] as its spiritual guide, claimed the elections were the last chance for India to choose between \"democracy and dictatorship.\" The Congress Party split during the election campaign of 1977: veteran Indira supporters like [[Jagjivan Ram]], [[Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna]] and [[Nandini Satpathy]] were compelled to part ways and form a new political entity, CFD ([[Congress for Democracy]]), primarily due to intra-party politicking and also due to circumstances created by Sanjay Gandhi. The prevailing rumour was that Sanjay had intentions of dislodging Gandhi and the trio stood between that. Gandhi's Congress party was crushed soundly in the elections. The public realized the statement and motto of the Janata Party alliance. Indira and [[Sanjay Gandhi]] both lost their seats, and Congress was cut down to 153 seats (compared with 350 in the previous Lok Sabha), 92 of which were in the South. The Janata alliance, under the leadership of [[Morarji Desai]], came into power after the State of Emergency was lifted. The alliance parties later merged to form the [[Janata Party]] under the guidance of Gandhian leader, [[Jayaprakash Narayan]].

Her arrest and long-running trial gained her great sympathy from many people. The Janata coalition was only united by its hatred of Gandhi (or \"that woman\" as some called her). The party included right wing Hindu Nationalists, Socialists and former Congress party members. With so little in common, the Morarji Desai government was bogged down by infighting. In 1979, the government started to unravel over the issue of dual loyalties of some members to Janata and the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh|RSS]]. The ambitious Union Finance minister, [[Charan Singh]], who as the Union Home Minister during the previous year had ordered arrest of Gandhi, took advantage of this and started courting the Congress. After a significant exodus from the party to Charan Singh's faction, Desai resigned in July 1979.

The support of the Soviets with arms supplies and casting of veto at United Nations helped in winning and consolidating the victory over Pakistan in the 1971 Bangladesh liberation war. Prior to the war Indira signed a treaty of friendship with the Soviets. The Soviets were not happy with the 1974 nuclear test conducted by India but did not support further action because of the ensuing Cold War with the United States. Indira was not happy with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan but once again calculations involving relations with Pakistan and China kept from criticizing the Soviet Union harshly.

The alliance was made up of [[Bharatiya Jana Sangh]], [[Indian National Congress (Organisation)|Congress (O)]], The Socialist parties, and [[Charan Singh]]'s [[Bharatiya Kranti Dal]] representing northern peasant and farmers. Janata alliance, with [[Jai Prakash Narayan]] as its spiritual guide, claimed the elections were the last chance for India to choose between \"democracy and dictatorship.\" The Congress Party split during the election campaign of 1977: veteran Indira supporters like [[Jagjivan Ram]], [[Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna]] and [[Nandini Satpathy]] were compelled to part ways and form a new political entity, CFD ([[Congress for Democracy]]), primarily due to intra-party politicking and also due to circumstances created by Sanjay Gandhi. The prevailing rumour was that Sanjay had intentions of dislodging Gandhi and the trio stood between that. Gandhi's Congress party was crushed soundly in the elections. The public realized the statement and motto of the Janata Party alliance. Indira and [[Sanjay Gandhi]] both lost their seats, and Congress was cut down to 153 seats (compared with 350 in the previous Lok Sabha), 92 of which were in the South. The Janata alliance, under the leadership of [[Morarji Desai]], came into power after the State of Emergency was lifted. The alliance parties later merged to form the [[Janata Party]] under the guidance of Gandhian leader, [[Jayaprakash Narayan]].

Her arrest and long-running trial gained her great sympathy from many people. The Janata coalition was only united by its hatred of Gandhi (or \"that woman\" as some called her). The party included right wing Hindu Nationalists, Socialists and former Congress party members. With so little in common, the Morarji Desai government was bogged down by infighting. In 1979, the government started to unravel over the issue of dual loyalties of some members to Janata and the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh|RSS]]. The ambitious Union Finance minister, [[Charan Singh]], who as the Union Home Minister during the previous year had ordered arrest of Gandhi, took advantage of this and started courting the Congress. After a significant exodus from the party to Charan Singh's faction, Desai resigned in July 1979.

The support of the Soviets with arms supplies and casting of veto at United Nations helped in winning and consolidating the victory over Pakistan in the 1971 Bangladesh liberation war. Prior to the war Indira signed a treaty of friendship with the Soviets. The Soviets were not happy with the 1974 nuclear test conducted by India but did not support further action because of the ensuing Cold War with the United States. Indira was not happy with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan but once again calculations involving relations with Pakistan and China kept from criticizing the Soviet Union harshly.

First flown in 1954, the MS.760 Paris differs from subsequent business jets in having only four seats arranged in two rows without a center aisle, an arrangement similar to a [[light aircraft]], under a large sliding [[canopy (aircraft)|canopy]] similar to that of a [[fighter aircraft|fighter]]. A U.S. [[type certificate]] was awarded in July 1958, but commercial sales were limited, with most examples going to the military; an improved civil version similar to a modern [[very light jet]], with a 6-seat enclosed cabin and a conventional door, never proceeded past the prototype stage.<ref name=GA_2010>{{cite magazine |last=Jerram |first=Mike |date=October 2010 |title=Morane-Saulnier Paris: the very first Very Light Jet |url=http://www.iaopa.eu/mediaServlet/storage/gamag/oct10/p42-45.pdf |magazine=General Aviation |publisher=international Council of Aircraft Owners and Pilots Associations |access-date=17 April 2020 }}</ref> The commercial failure of the MS.760 Paris prompted the cancellation of projects by [[Cessna]] and [[Douglas Aircraft]] to market similar jets.<ref name=Flying1987/>\n\nThe development of center-aisle cabin business jets was accelerated by an August 1956 [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) letter of requirement for two \"off-the-shelf\" aircraft: the larger UCX (cargo) and smaller UTX (trainer). These requirements differed from standard Air Force procurement contracts in that there would be no formal competitions, and manufacturers were expected to develop the aircraft without government funds; despite this, a substantial USAF purchase would offset the large investment necessary to develop prototypes. The [[Lockheed Corporation]] and [[McDonnell Aircraft]] both began development of UCX aircraft, while [[North American Aviation]] pursued the UTX requirement.<ref name=Flying1987>{{cite news |last=Peter |first=Garrison |title=BABY BIZJET BOOM: The birth of the light jet. |work=[[Flying (magazine)|Flying]] |date=September 1987 |pages=124\u2013126 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Off-The-Shelf Jets |work=[[Flying (magazine)|Flying]] |date=May 1959 |pages=26\u201327, 79 }}</ref>\n\n=== 1950s first flight ===\nThe [[Morane-Saulnier MS.760 Paris]] had a [[aircraft gross weight|gross weight]] of {{convert|7650|lb|t}}, initially powered by two [[Turbom\u00e9ca Marbor\u00e9]] [[turbojet]]s of {{convert|880|lbf|kN}} thrust, although most aircraft were later upgraded to {{convert|1058|lbf|kN}} units.

From 1967 to the late 70s, 258 were built and it led to the ongoing [[Gulfstream Aerospace]] long range family.\n\nThe {{convert|11,850|lb|t}} MTOW [[Cessna Citation I]] first flew on 15 September 1969, powered by two {{convert|2,200|lbf|kN}} [[Pratt & Whitney Canada JT15D]] turbofans. Produced between 1969 and 1985 for a total of 689 examples, it is the first of the [[Cessna Citation family]].\n\n=== 1970s first flight ===\n\nThe trijet [[Dassault Falcon 50]] made its first flight on 7 November 1976. The {{convert|40000|lb|t}} MTOW airplane is powered by three {{convert|3700|lbf|kN}} TFE731 engines. With the cross-section of the Falcon 20, it is the basis of the larger [[Falcon 900]].\n\nOn 8 November 1978, the prototype [[Canadair Challenger]] took off. The {{convert|43000|-|48000|lb|t}} MTOW craft, usually powered by two {{convert|9200|lbf|kN}} [[General Electric CF34]]s, formed the basis of the long range [[Bombardier Global Express]] family and of the [[Bombardier CRJ]] regional airliners. The 1000th Challenger entered service in 2015.\n\nOn 30 May 1979 the clean-sheet {{convert|22,000|lb|t}} MTOW [[Cessna Citation III]] took off for the first time, powered by two {{convert|3,650|lbf|kN}} TFE731s.\n\nThe [[Mitsubishi MU-300 Diamond]] made its first flight on 29 August 1978. The {{convert|16,100|lb|t}} MTOW jet was powered by two {{convert|2,900|lbf|kN}} [[JT15D]]. The design was later sold and was renamed Beechjet 400 then [[Hawker 400]], with a total of 950 produced of all variants.\n\n=== 1980s first flight ===\n\nThe 1980s only saw the introduction of derivatives and no major new designs.

All of the 642 aircraft built since then have been powered by two {{convert|3,500|lbf|kN}} TFE731 engines.\n\nPowered by two {{convert|2,300|lbf|kN}} [[Williams FJ44]]s, the {{convert|12,500|lb|t}} [[Beechcraft Premier I]] light jet made its first flight on 22 December 1998. Nearly 300 had been made before production stopped in 2013.\n\n=== 2000s first flight ===\n\nIn the opposite way compared to Bombardier, which developed airliners from a business jet, Embraer derived the [[Legacy 600]] from the [[Embraer ERJ family]] of regional jet airliners. Powered by two {{convert|39.2|kN|lbf|order=flip}} [[Rolls-Royce AE 3007]]s, the first flight of the {{convert|22.5|t|lb|order=flip}} aircraft was on 31 March 2001.\n\nOn 14 August 2001, the [[Bombardier Challenger 300]] made its first flight. The {{convert|38,850|lb|t}} aircraft is powered by two {{convert|6,825|lbf|kN}} [[HTF7000]]s. The 500th example was delivered in 2015.\n\nThe first very light jet, the {{convert|5,950|lb|t}} MTOW [[Eclipse 500]], took off for the first time on 26 August 2002, powered by two {{convert|900|lbf|kN}} [[Pratt & Whitney Canada PW600]]s. Between then and the end of production in 2008, 260 were produced.\n\nIt was followed by the {{convert|8645|lb|t}} MTOW [[Cessna Citation Mustang]] on 23 April 2005, powered by two {{convert|1460|lbf|kN}} Pratt & Whitney Canada PW600s and with more than 450 produced.\n\nThen the [[Embraer Phenom 100]] made its maiden flight on 26 July 2007. The {{convert|4.75|t|lb|order=flip}} MTOW airplane is powered by two {{convert|7.2|kN|lbf|order=flip}} Pratt & Whitney Canada PW600s. With its [[Phenom 300]] development, nearly 600 have been built.\n\n=== 2010s first flight ===\n\nThe first flight of the midsize, [[fly-by-wire]], {{cvt|7,000|lbf|kN}} [[Honeywell HTF7000]]-powered [[Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600|Embraer Legacy 500]] was on 27 November 2012.

Maintenance services can also be provided.\n\nIn the United States, business aircraft may be operated under either FAR 91 as private operations for the business purposes of the owner, or under [[Federal Aviation Regulations#Organization|FAR 135]] of the Federal Aviation Regulations as commercial operations for the business purposes of a third party. One common arrangement for operational flexibility purposes is for the aircraft's owner to operate the aircraft under FAR 91 when needed for its own purposes, and to allow a third-party charter-manager to operate it under FAR 135 when the aircraft is needed for the business purposes of third parties (such as for other entities within the corporate group of the aircraft's owner).<ref>{{cite web|last=Epstein|first=Jonathan M.|title=Placing Your Aircraft With An Aircraft Charter-Management Company|url=http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/266322/Aviation/Placing+Your+Aircraft+with+an+Aircraft&email_access=on|publisher=[[Holland & Knight]]|accessdate=4 October 2013|date=1 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nAircraft charter brokers have entered the marketplace through the ease of setting up a website and business online. Aircraft charter operators are legally responsible for the safe operation of aircraft and charter brokers require no economic authority and are largely unregulated. The [[Department of Transportation]] requires that air charter brokers disclose to the consumer that they do not operate aircraft and cannot use terms like \"our fleet of aircraft\", \"we operate\", \"our charter service\" and others.<ref>{{cite web|title=THE ROLE OF AIR CHARTER BROKERS IN ARRANGING AIR TRANSPORTATION|url=https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/docs/BrokerNoticeFinal%20Guidance.pdf|website=Department of Transportation|publisher=Department of Transportation}}</ref>\n\n===Fractional ownership===\nSince 1996 the term \"fractional jet\" has been used in connection with business aircraft owned by a consortium of companies. Under such arrangements, overhead costs such as [[aircrew member|flight crew]], hangarage and maintenance are split among the users.\n\n[[Fractional ownership of aircraft]] involves an individual or corporation that pays an upfront equity share for the cost of an aircraft. If four parties are involved, a partner would pay one-fourth of the aircraft price (a \"quarter share\"). That partner is now an equity owner in that aircraft and can sell the equity position if necessary. This also entitles the new owner to a certain number of hours of flight time on that aircraft, or any comparable aircraft in the fleet. Additional fees include monthly management fees and incidentals such as catering and ground transportation. In the United States, fractional-ownership operations may be regulated by either FAA [[Part 91 operator|part 91 or part 135]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The Rules of the Game |url=https://www.bjtonline.com/business-jet-news/the-rules-of-the-game |website=Business Jet Traveler |publisher=Business Jet Traveler |accessdate=17 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Surveillance ===\n\nWith smaller equipment, long-range business aircraft can be modified as [[surveillance aircraft]] to perform specialized missions cost-effectively, from ground surveillance to maritime patrol:<ref>{{cite news |url= http://aviationweek.com/business-aviation/spotlight-bizjet-based-special-mission-aircraft |title= Spotlight on Bizjet-based Special Mission Aircraft |date= 10 January 2018 |author= Graham Warwick |work= Aviation Week & Space Technology}}</ref>\n* the {{cvt|99,500|lb}}, 6,000 nmi [[Bombardier Global 6000]] is the platform for the USAF [[Northrop Grumman E-11]]A Battlefield Airborne Communications Node, the radar-carrying ground-surveillance [[Raytheon Sentinel]] for the [[UK Royal Air Force]], and Saab's [[Globaleye]] AEW&C carrying its [[Erieye]] AESA radar as UK's [[Marshall ADG]] basis for [[Elint]]/[[Sigint]] for the [[United Arab Emirates]]; it is also the base for the proposed [[Saab AB]] Swordfish MPA and the USAF [[Lockheed Martin]] [[JSTARS#Future|J-Stars Recap]] battlefield-surveillance program, while [[Israel Aerospace Industries|IAI]]'s ELI-3360 [[Maritime patrol aircraft|MPA]] is based on the Global 5000;\n* The {{cvt|91,000|lb}}, 6,750 nmi [[Gulfstream G550]] was selected for the [[IAI EL/W-2085]] Conformal Airborne Early Warning [[AESA radar]] for Italy, Singapore and Israel (which also has IAI Sigint G550s) while [[L3 Technologies]] transfers the U.S. [[Compass Call]] electronic-attack system to the G550 CAEW-based EC-37B, like the NC-37B range-support aircraft, and will modify others for Australia's {{abbr|AISREW|Airborne Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Electronic Warfare}} program, [[Northrop Grumman]] proposes the G550 for the J-Stars Recap;\n* Dassault Aviation developed the Falcon 900 MPA and Falcon 2000 Maritime Multirole Aircraft for France (which delayed its Avsimar requirement), South Korea and the [[Japan Coast Guard]] with a mission system developed with L3 and [[Thales Group]];\n* Embraer delivered several EMB-145s as a platform for [[AEW&C]], MPA and multi-[[Military intelligence|intelligence]];\n\n==Classes==\nBusiness jets can be categorized according to their size.\n\n===Very light jets===\n{{main|Very light jet}}\n[[File:N816CW Cessna Citation Mustang (7534559132).jpg|thumb|The most-sold VLJ is the [[Cessna Citation Mustang]].]]\n\nThe [[very light jet]] (VLJ) is a classification initiated by the release of the [[Eclipse 500]],<ref name=JA/><ref name=AC/><ref name=FMvlj/> on 31 December 2006, which was originally available at around US$1.5 million, cheaper than existing business jets and comparable with turboprop aircraft.

small groups of people. Business jets may be adapted for other roles, such as the evacuation of casualties or express parcel deliveries, and some are used by public bodies, [[government official]]s or the [[armed forces]].\n\n== History ==\n===Early developments===\nThe first jet-powered civil aircraft was the [[Morane-Saulnier MS.760 Paris]], developed privately in the early 1950s from the [[Morane-Saulnier MS.755 Fleuret|MS.755 Fleuret]] two-seat [[jet trainer]]. First flown in 1954, the MS.760 Paris differs from subsequent business jets in having only four seats arranged in two rows without a center aisle, an arrangement similar to a [[light aircraft]], under a large sliding [[canopy (aircraft)|canopy]] similar to that of a [[fighter aircraft|fighter]]. A U.S. [[type certificate]] was awarded in July 1958, but commercial sales were limited, with most examples going to the military; an improved civil version similar to a modern [[very light jet]], with a 6-seat enclosed cabin and a swinging door, never proceeded past the prototype stage.<ref name=GA_2010>{{cite magazine |last=Jerram |first=Mike |date=October 2010 |title=Morane-Saulnier Paris: the very first Very Light Jet |url=http://www.iaopa.eu/mediaServlet/storage/gamag/oct10/p42-45.pdf |magazine=General Aviation |publisher=international Council of Aircraft Owners and Pilots Associations |access-date=17 April 2020 }}</ref> The commercial failure of the MS.760 Paris prompted the cancellation of projects by [[Cessna]] and [[Douglas Aircraft]] to market similar jets.<ref name=Flying1987/>\n\nThe development of center-aisle cabin business jets was accelerated by an August 1956 [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) letter of requirement for two \"off-the-shelf\" aircraft: the larger UCX (cargo) and smaller UTX (trainer). These requirements differed from standard Air Force procurement contracts in that there would be no formal competitions, and manufacturers were expected to develop the aircraft without government funds; despite this, a substantial USAF purchase would offset the large investment necessary to develop prototypes.

[[Ford Motor Company]], [[Chrysler]], and [[Altria]] are examples of companies that own, maintain and operate their own fleet of private aircraft for their employees. Flight departments handle all aspects of aircraft operation and maintenance. In the United States, flight-department aircraft operate under [[Federal Aviation Regulations#Organization|FAR 91]] operating rules.\n\nA 2010 study by the United States [[National Business Aviation Association]] found that small and midsize companies that use private jets produce a 219% higher earnings growth rate than those that strictly use airlines.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.nbaa.org/business-aviation/NEXA-Report-Part-2-2010.pdf |title= Business aviation : an enterprise value perspective |publisher= [[National Business Aviation Association]] |date= Fall 2010 }}</ref>\n\n===Charter companies===\nCharter operators own or manage private jets for multiple clients. Like traditional flight departments, charter companies handle all aspects of aircraft operation and maintenance. However, they are not aligned with just one corporation. They manage aircraft for a private owner or corporation and also handle the sales of available flight time on the aircraft they own or manage. Maintenance services can also be provided.\n\nIn the United States, business aircraft may be operated under either FAR 91 as private operations for the business purposes of the owner, or under [[Federal Aviation Regulations#Organization|FAR 135]] of the Federal Aviation Regulations as commercial operations for the business purposes of a third party. One common arrangement for operational flexibility purposes is for the aircraft's owner to operate the aircraft under FAR 91 when needed for its own purposes, and to allow a third-party charter-manager to operate it under FAR 135 when the aircraft is needed for the business purposes of third parties (such as for other entities within the corporate group of the aircraft's owner).<ref>{{cite web|last=Epstein|first=Jonathan M.|title=Placing Your Aircraft With An Aircraft Charter-Management Company|url=http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/266322/Aviation/Placing+Your+Aircraft+with+an+Aircraft&email_access=on|publisher=[[Holland & Knight]]|accessdate=4 October 2013|date=1 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nAircraft charter brokers have entered the marketplace through the ease of setting up a website and business online. Aircraft charter operators are legally responsible for the safe operation of aircraft and charter brokers require no economic authority and are largely unregulated. The [[Department of Transportation]] requires that air charter brokers disclose to the consumer that they do not operate aircraft and cannot use terms like \"our fleet of aircraft\", \"we operate\", \"our charter service\" and others.<ref>{{cite web|title=THE ROLE OF AIR CHARTER BROKERS IN ARRANGING AIR TRANSPORTATION|url=https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/docs/BrokerNoticeFinal%20Guidance.pdf|website=Department of Transportation|publisher=Department of Transportation}}</ref>\n\n===Fractional ownership===\nSince 1996 the term \"fractional jet\" has been used in connection with business aircraft owned by a consortium of companies. Under such arrangements, overhead costs such as [[aircrew member|flight crew]], hangarage and maintenance are split among the users.\n\n[[Fractional ownership of aircraft]] involves an individual or corporation that pays an upfront equity share for the cost of an aircraft. If four parties are involved, a partner would pay one-fourth of the aircraft price (a \"quarter share\"). That partner is now an equity owner in that aircraft and can sell the equity position if necessary. This also entitles the new owner to a certain number of hours of flight time on that aircraft, or any comparable aircraft in the fleet. Additional fees include monthly management fees and incidentals such as catering and ground transportation. In the United States, fractional-ownership operations may be regulated by either FAA [[Part 91 operator|part 91 or part 135]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The Rules of the Game |url=https://www.bjtonline.com/business-jet-news/the-rules-of-the-game |website=Business Jet Traveler |publisher=Business Jet Traveler |accessdate=17 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Surveillance ===\n\nWith smaller equipment, long-range business aircraft can be modified as [[surveillance aircraft]] to perform specialized missions cost-effectively, from ground surveillance to maritime patrol:<ref>{{cite news |url= http://aviationweek.com/business-aviation/spotlight-bizjet-based-special-mission-aircraft |title= Spotlight on Bizjet-based Special Mission Aircraft |date= 10 January 2018 |author= Graham Warwick |work= Aviation Week & Space Technology}}</ref>\n* the {{cvt|99,500|lb}}, 6,000 nmi [[Bombardier Global 6000]] is the platform for the USAF [[Northrop Grumman E-11]]A Battlefield Airborne Communications Node, the radar-carrying ground-surveillance [[Raytheon Sentinel]] for the [[UK Royal Air Force]], and Saab's [[Globaleye]] AEW&C carrying its [[Erieye]] AESA radar as UK's [[Marshall ADG]] basis for [[Elint]]/[[Sigint]] for the [[United Arab Emirates]]; it is also the base for the proposed [[Saab AB]] Swordfish MPA and the USAF [[Lockheed Martin]] [[JSTARS#Future|J-Stars Recap]] battlefield-surveillance program, while [[Israel Aerospace Industries|IAI]]'s ELI-3360 [[Maritime patrol aircraft|MPA]] is based on the Global 5000;\n* The {{cvt|91,000|lb}}, 6,750 nmi [[Gulfstream G550]] was selected for the [[IAI EL/W-2085]] Conformal Airborne Early Warning [[AESA radar]] for Italy, Singapore and Israel (which also has IAI Sigint G550s) while [[L3 Technologies]] transfers the U.S. [[Compass Call]] electronic-attack system to the G550 CAEW-based EC-37B, like the NC-37B range-support aircraft, and will modify others for Australia's {{abbr|AISREW|Airborne Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Electronic Warfare}} program, [[Northrop Grumman]] proposes the G550 for the J-Stars Recap;\n* Dassault Aviation developed the Falcon 900 MPA and Falcon 2000 Maritime Multirole Aircraft for France (which delayed its Avsimar requirement), South Korea and the [[Japan Coast Guard]] with a mission system developed with L3 and [[Thales Group]];\n* Embraer delivered several EMB-145s as a platform for [[AEW&C]], MPA and multi-[[Military intelligence|intelligence]];\n\n==Classes==\nBusiness jets can be categorized according to their size.\n\n===Very light jets===\n{{main|Very light jet}}\n[[File:N816CW Cessna Citation Mustang (7534559132).jpg|thumb|The most-sold VLJ is the [[Cessna Citation Mustang]].]]\n\nThe [[very light jet]] (VLJ) is a classification initiated by the release of the [[Eclipse 500]],<ref name=JA/><ref name=AC/><ref name=FMvlj/> on 31 December 2006, which was originally available at around US$1.5 million, cheaper than existing business jets and comparable with turboprop aircraft.

Thus [[Nulliparity|not having children]] is a risk factor for ovarian cancer, likely because ovulation is suppressed via pregnancy.  During ovulation, cells are constantly stimulated to divide while ovulatory cycles continue. Therefore, [[Nulliparity|people who have not borne children]] are at twice the risk of ovarian cancer than those who have. A longer period of ovulation caused by early [[menarche|first menstruation]] and late [[menopause]] is also a risk factor.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" /><ref name=\"CRUKRisks\" /><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gong TT, Wu QJ, Vogtmann E, Lin B, Wang YL | title = Age at menarche and risk of ovarian cancer: a meta-analysis of epidemiological studies | journal = International Journal of Cancer | volume = 132 | issue = 12 | pages = 2894\u2013900 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 23175139 | pmc = 3806278 | doi = 10.1002/ijc.27952 }}</ref> Both obesity and hormone replacement therapy also raise the risk.<ref name=Harrisons/>\n\nThe risk of developing ovarian cancer is less for women who have fewer menstrual cycles, no menstrual cycles, [[breast feeding]], take oral contraceptives, have multiple pregnancies, and have a pregnancy at an early age.  The risk of developing ovarian cancer is reduced in women who have had [[tubal ligation]] (colloquially known as having one's \"tubes tied\"), both ovaries removed, or [[hysterectomy]] (an operation in which the uterus, and sometimes the cervix, is removed).<ref name=\"CDCsep2016\" /> Age is also a risk factor.<ref name = Harrisons/><ref name=\"Gib2016\"/>\n\n=== Hormones ===\nUse of fertility medication may contribute to ovarian [[borderline tumor]] formation, but the link between the two is disputed and difficult to study.<ref name=Jayson/> Fertility drugs may be associated with a higher risk of borderline tumors.<ref name=\":7\" /> Those who have been treated for infertility but remain nulliparous are at higher risk for epithelial ovarian cancer; however, those who are successfully treated for infertility and subsequently give birth are at no higher risk.

People with [[hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer]] (Lynch syndrome), and those with BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 genetic abnormalities are at increased risk.\n\nThe major genetic risk factor for ovarian cancer is a mutation in ''BRCA1'' or ''BRCA2'' genes, or in [[DNA mismatch repair]] genes, which is present in 10% of ovarian cancer cases. Only one [[allele]] need be mutated to place a person at high risk. The gene can be inherited through either the maternal or paternal line, but has variable [[penetrance]].<ref name=Harrisons/><ref name=Hoffman35/> Though mutations in these genes are usually associated with increased risk of breast cancer, they also carry a substantial lifetime risk of ovarian cancer, a risk that peaks in a person's 40s and 50s. The lowest risk cited is 30% and the highest 60%.<ref name=Jayson/><ref name=Harrisons/><ref name=Hoffman35/> Mutations in BRCA1 have a lifetime risk of developing ovarian cancer of 15\u201345%.<ref name=\":7\" /> Mutations in ''BRCA2'' are less risky than those with ''BRCA1'', with a lifetime risk of 10% (lowest risk cited) to 40% (highest risk cited).<ref name=Harrisons/><ref name=\":7\" /> On average, BRCA-associated cancers develop 15 years before their sporadic counterparts because people who inherit the mutations on one copy of their gene only need one mutation to start the process of carcinogenesis, whereas people with two normal genes would need to acquire two mutations.<ref name=Hoffman35/>\n\nIn the United States, five of 100 women with a [[first-degree relative]] with ovarian cancer will eventually get ovarian cancer themselves, placing those with affected family members at triple the risk of women with unaffected family members.

Low-grade serous adenocarcinomas resemble Fallopian tube epithelium, whereas high-grade serous adenocarcinomas show [[anaplasia]] and [[nuclear atypia]].<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" />\n\n50% of the time, serous carcinomas are bilateral, and in 85% of cases, they have spread beyond the ovary at the time of diagnosis. Most have a diameter over 15&nbsp;cm.<ref name=\"Levy\" />\n\n===== Small-cell carcinoma =====\n[[Small-cell carcinoma|Small-cell]] ovarian carcinoma is rare and aggressive, with two main subtypes: hypercalcemic and pulmonary. It is typically fatal within 2 years of diagnosis. Hypercalcemic small cell ovarian carcinoma overwhelmingly affects those in their 20s, causes [[Hypercalcaemia|high blood calcium levels]], and affects one ovary. Pulmonary small cell ovarian cancer usually affects both ovaries of older women and looks like [[Small-cell carcinoma|oat-cell carcinoma of the lung]].<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" />\n\n====== Primary peritoneal carcinoma ======\n{{Main|Primary peritoneal carcinoma}}Primary peritoneal carcinomas develop from the [[peritoneum]], a membrane that covers the [[abdominal cavity]] that has the same embryonic origin as the ovary.

Japanese women develop clear-cell ovarian cancer more frequently than other groups of women.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n===== Clear-cell adenocarcinoma =====\n[[File:Clear cell carcinoma hobnail cells.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Hobnail cells seen in a clear cell carcinoma sample]]\n\nClear-cell adenocarcinomas are histopathologically similar to other [[clear cell carcinoma]]s, with [[clear cell]]s and [[hobnail cell]]s. They represent approximately 5\u201310% of epithelial ovarian cancers and are associated with endometriosis in the pelvic cavity. They are typically early-stage and therefore curable by surgery, but advanced clear-cell adenocarcinomas (approximately 20%) have a poor prognosis and are often resistant to platinum chemotherapy.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" />\n\n===== Endometrioid =====\nEndometrioid adenocarcinomas make up approximately 15\u201320% of epithelial ovarian cancers. Because they are typically low-grade, endometrioid adenocarcinomas have a good prognosis. These tumors frequently co-occur with [[endometriosis]] or endometrial cancer.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" />\n\n====== Malignant mixed m\u00fcllerian tumor (carcinosarcoma) ======\nMixed m\u00fcllerian tumors make up less than 1% of ovarian cancer. They have epithelial and mesenchymal cells visible and tend to have a poor prognosis.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" />\n\n===== Mucinous =====\nMucinous tumors include mucinous adenocarcinoma and mucinous cystadenocarcinoma.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" />\n\n====== Mucinous adenocarcinoma ======\n{{Main|Mucinous adenocarcinoma}}\n\nMucinous adenocarcinomas make up 5\u201310% of epithelial ovarian cancers. Histologically, they are similar to intestinal or cervical adenocarcinomas and are often actually metastases of [[appendiceal cancer|appendiceal]] or [[colon cancer]]s. Advanced mucinous adenocarcinomas have a poor prognosis, generally worse than serous tumors, and are often resistant to platinum chemotherapy, though they are rare.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" />\n\n====== Pseudomyxoma peritonei ======\n{{Main|Pseudomyxoma peritonei}}\n\n''Pseudomyxoma peritonei'' refers to a collection of encapsulated mucous or gelatinous material in the abdominopelvic cavity, which is very rarely caused by a primary mucinous ovarian tumor. More commonly, it is associated with ovarian metastases of intestinal cancer.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" />\n\n===== Undifferentiated epithelial =====\nUndifferentiated cancers - those where the cell type cannot be determined - make up about 10% of epithelial ovarian cancers and have a comparatively poor prognosis.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> When examined under the microscope, these tumors have very abnormal cells that are arranged in clumps or sheets. Usually there are recognizable clumps of serous cells inside the tumor.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" />\n\n====== Malignant Brenner tumor ======\n{{Main|Brenner tumor}}\n\nMalignant Brenner tumors are rare. Histologically, they have dense fibrous stroma with areas of transitional epithelium, and some squamous differentiation. To be classified as a malignant Brenner tumor, it must have Brenner tumor foci and transitional cell carcinoma. The transitional cell carcinoma component is typically poorly differentiated and resembles urinary tract cancer.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" />\n\n====== Transitional cell carcinoma ======\n{{Main|Transitional cell carcinoma}}\n\nTransitional cell carcinomas represent less than 5% of ovarian cancers. Histologically, they appear similar to [[bladder carcinoma]]. The prognosis is intermediate - better than most epithelial cancers but worse than malignant Brenner tumors.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" />\n\n==== Sex cord-stromal tumor ====\n{{Main|Sex cord-stromal tumor}}\n\n[[Sex cord-stromal tumour|Sex cord-stromal tumor]], including [[estrogen]]-producing [[granulosa cell tumor]], the benign [[thecoma]], and virilizing [[Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor]] or [[arrhenoblastoma]], accounts for 7% of ovarian cancers. They occur most frequently in women between 50 and 69 years of age but can occur in women of any age, including young girls. They are not typically aggressive and are usually unilateral;<ref name=Harrisons/> they are therefore usually treated with surgery alone. Sex cord-stromal tumors are the main hormone-producing ovarian tumors.<ref name=\":8\">{{harvnb|Williams Gynecology|2012}}</ref>\n\nSeveral different cells from the [[mesenchyme]] can give rise to sex-cord or stromal tumors. These include [[fibroblast]]s and endocrine cells. The symptoms of a sex-cord or stromal ovarian tumor can differ from other types of ovarian cancer. Common signs and symptoms include [[ovarian torsion]], [[hemorrhage]] from or rupture of the tumor, an abdominal mass, and hormonal disruption. In children, [[precocious puberty#Isosexual and heterosexual|isosexual precocious pseudopuberty]] may occur with granulosa cell tumors since they produce estrogen. These tumors cause abnormalities in menstruation ([[menometrorrhagia|excessive bleeding]], [[oligomenorrhea|infrequent menstruation]], or [[amenorrhea|no menstruation]]) or postmenopausal bleeding. Because these tumors produce estrogen, they can cause or occur at the same time as [[endometrial cancer]] or [[breast cancer]]. Other sex-cord/stromal tumors present with distinct symptoms. Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors cause [[virilization]] and [[hirsutism|excessive hair growth]] due to the production of [[testosterone]] and [[androstenedione]], which can also cause [[Cushing's syndrome]] in rare cases. Also, sex-cord stromal tumors occur that do not cause a hormonal imbalance, including benign fibromas, which cause ascites and [[hydrothorax]].<ref name=Harrisons/> With germ cell tumors, sex cord-stromal tumors are the most common ovarian cancer diagnosed in women under 20.<ref name=\":8\"/>\n\n===== Granulosa cell tumor =====\nGranulosa cell tumors are the most common sex-cord stromal tumors, making up 70% of cases, and are divided into two histologic subtypes: adult granulosa cell tumors, which develop in women over 50, and juvenile granulosa tumors, which develop before puberty or before the age of 30. Both develop in the [[ovarian follicle]] from a population of cells that surrounds [[germinal cell]]s.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n====== Adult granulosa cell tumor ======\nAdult granulosa cell tumors are characterized by later onset (30+ years, 50 on average). These tumors produce high levels of estrogen, which causes its characteristic symptoms: [[menometrorrhagia]]; [[endometrial hyperplasia]]; [[Breast pain|tender]], [[Breast enlargement|enlarged breasts]]; [[Vaginal bleeding|postmenopausal bleeding]]; and [[Amenorrhoea|secondary amenorrhea]]. The mass of the tumor can cause other symptoms, including abdominal pain and distension, or symptoms similar to an [[ectopic pregnancy]] if the tumor bleeds and ruptures.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n====== Juvenile granulosa cell tumor ======\n\n===== Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor =====\nSertoli-Leydig tumors are most common in women before the age of 30, and particularly common before puberty.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n===== Sclerosing stromal tumors =====\nSclerosing stromal tumors  typically occur in girls before puberty or women before the age of 30.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n==== Germ cell tumor ====\n{{Main|Ovarian germ cell tumors}}\nGerm cell tumors of the ovary develop from the ovarian [[germ cells]].<ref name=\":1\" /> [[Germ cell tumor]] accounts for about 30% of ovarian tumors, but only 5% of ovarian cancers, because most germ-cell tumors are [[teratoma]]s and most teratomas are benign. Malignant teratomas tend to occur in older women, when one of the germ layers in the tumor develops into a [[squamous cell carcinoma]].<ref name=Harrisons/> Germ-cell tumors tend to occur in young women (20s\u201330s) and girls, making up 70% of the ovarian cancer seen in that age group.<ref name=Current>{{cite book |chapter = Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology |title = Current Diagnosis & Treatment Obstetrics & Gynecology |isbn = 978-0071638562  |edition = 11th |year = 2012 |first1 = Alan |last1 = DeCherney |first2 = Lauren |last2 = Nathan  |first3 = T.

Some germ-cell tumors have an [[isochromosome]] 12, where one arm of chromosome 12 is deleted and replaced with a duplicate of the other.<ref name=Harrisons/> Most germ-cell cancers have a better prognosis than other subtypes and are more sensitive to chemotherapy. They are more likely to be stage I at diagnosis.<ref name=\":8\" /> Overall, they metastasize more frequently than epithelial ovarian cancers. In addition, the cancer markers used vary with tumor type: [[choriocarcinomas]] are monitored with [[beta-HCG]] and endodermal sinus tumors with [[alpha-fetoprotein]].<ref name=Harrisons/>\n\nGerm-cell tumors are typically discovered when they become large, palpable masses. However, like sex cord tumors, they can cause ovarian torsion or hemorrhage and, in children, isosexual precocious puberty. They frequently metastasize to nearby lymph nodes, especially para-aortic and pelvic lymph nodes.<ref name=Harrisons/> The most common symptom of germ cell tumors is [[Abdominal pain|subacute abdominal pain]] caused by the tumor bleeding, [[Necrosis|necrotizing]], or stretching the [[ovarian capsule]]. If the tumor ruptures, causes significant bleeding, or torses the ovary, it can cause [[Acute abdomen|acute abdominal pain]], which occurs in less than 10% of those with germ-cell tumors. They can also secrete hormones which change the [[menstrual cycle]]. In 25% of germ-cell tumors, the cancer is discovered during a [[Well-woman examination|routine examination]] and does not cause symptoms.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nDiagnosing germ cell tumors may be difficult because the normal menstrual cycle and [[puberty]] can cause pain and pelvic symptoms, and a young woman may even believe these symptoms to be those of pregnancy, and not seek treatment due to the stigma of [[Teenage pregnancy|teen pregnancy]]. Blood tests for alpha-fetoprotein, [[karyotype]], human chorionic gonadotropin, and liver function are used to diagnose germ cell tumor and potential co-occurring gonadal dysgenesis. A germ cell tumor may be initially mistaken for a benign [[ovarian cyst]].<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n===== Dysgerminoma =====\n{{Main|Dysgerminoma}}\nDysgerminoma accounts for 35% of ovarian cancer in young women and is the most likely germ cell tumor to metastasize to the lymph nodes; nodal metastases occur in 25\u201330% of cases.<ref name=Current/><ref name=\":8\" /> These tumors may have mutations in [[CD117|the ''KIT'' gene]], a mutation known for its role in [[gastrointestinal stromal tumor]]. [[Swyer syndrome|People with an XY karyotype and ovaries]] ([[gonadal dysgenesis]]) or an X,0 karyotype and ovaries ([[Turner syndrome]]) who develop a unilateral dysgerminoma are at risk for a [[gonadoblastoma]] in the other ovary, and in this case, both ovaries are usually removed when a unilateral dysgerminoma is discovered to avoid the risk of another malignant tumor. Gonadoblastomas in people with Swyer or Turner syndrome become malignant in approximately 40% of cases. However, in general, dysgerminomas are bilateral 10\u201320% of the time.<ref name=Harrisons/><ref name=\":8\" />\n\nThey are composed of cells that cannot [[Cellular differentiation|differentiate]] further and develop directly from germ cells or from gonadoblastomas. Dysgerminomas contain [[syncytiotrophoblast]]s in approximately 5% of cases, and can therefore cause elevated hCG levels. On gross appearance, dysgerminomas are typically pink to tan-colored, have multiple lobes, and are solid. Microscopically, they appear identical to [[seminoma]]s and very close to [[Embryonic germ cell|embryonic primordial germ cells]], having large, polyhedral, rounded [[clear cell]]s. The nuclei are uniform and round or square with prominent [[Nucleolus|nucleoli]] and the [[cytoplasm]] has high levels of [[glycogen]]. Inflammation is another prominent histologic feature of dysgerminomas.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n===== Choriocarcinoma =====\n{{Main|Choriocarcinoma}}\nChoriocarcinoma can occur as a primary ovarian tumor developing from a germ cell, though it is usually a gestational disease that metastasizes to the ovary. Primary ovarian choriocarcinoma has  a poor prognosis and can occur without a pregnancy. They produce high levels of hCG and can cause [[Precocious puberty|early puberty]] in children or [[menometrorrhagia]] (irregular, heavy menstruation) after menarche.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n===== Immature (solid) teratoma =====\n{{Main|Immature teratoma}}Immature, or solid, teratomas are the most common type of ovarian germ cell tumor, making up 40\u201350% of cases. Teratomas are characterized by the presence of disorganized tissues arising from all three embryonic [[germ layer]]s: [[ectoderm]], [[mesoderm]], and [[endoderm]]; immature teratomas also have undifferentiated [[stem cell]]s that make them more malignant than mature teratomas (dermoid cysts). The different tissues are visible on gross pathology and often include bone, cartilage, hair, [[mucus]], or [[Sebaceous gland|sebum]], but these tissues are not visible from the outside, which appears to be a solid mass with lobes and cysts. Histologically, they have large amounts of [[neuroectoderm]] organized into sheets and tubules along with [[Neuroglia|glia]]; the amount of neural tissue determines the histologic grade. Immature teratomas usually only affect one ovary (10% co-occur with dermoid cysts) and usually metastasize throughout the peritoneum. They can also cause mature teratoma implants to grow throughout the abdomen in a disease called [[growing teratoma syndrome]]; these are usually benign but will continue to grow during chemotherapy, and often necessitate further surgery. Unlike mature teratomas, immature teratomas form many [[Adhesion (medicine)|adhesions]], making them less likely to cause ovarian torsion. There is no specific marker for immature teratomas, but [[carcinoembryonic antigen]] (CEA), CA-125, CA19-9, or AFP can sometimes indicate an immature teratoma.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nStage I teratomas make up the majority (75%) of cases and have the best prognosis, with 98% of patients surviving 5 years; if a Stage I tumor is also grade 1, it can be treated with unilateral surgery only. Stage II though IV tumors make up the remaining quarter of cases and have a worse prognosis,  with 73\u201388% of patients surviving 5 years.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n===== Mature teratoma (dermoid cyst) =====\n{{Main|Dermoid cyst}}\nMature teratomas, or dermoid cysts, are rare tumors consisting of mostly benign tissue that develop after menopause. The tumors consist of disorganized tissue with nodules of malignant tissue, which can be of various types. The most common malignancy is [[Squamous-cell carcinoma|squamous cell carcinoma]], but [[adenocarcinoma]], [[basal-cell carcinoma]], [[Carcinoid|carcinoid tumor]], [[neuroectodermal tumor]], [[Melanoma|malignant melanoma]], [[sarcoma]], [[Sebaceous carcinoma|sebaceous tumor]], and [[struma ovarii]] can also be part of the dermoid cyst. They are treated with surgery and adjuvant platinum chemotherapy or radiation.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n===== Yolk sac tumor/endodermal sinus tumor =====\n{{Main|Yolk sac tumor}}\n[[Yolk sac]] tumors, formerly called endodermal sinus tumors, make up approximately 10\u201320% of ovarian germ cell malignancies, and have the worst prognosis of all [[ovarian germ cell tumors]]. They occur both before menarche (in one-third of cases) and after menarche (the remaining two-thirds of cases). Half of the people with yolk sac tumors are diagnosed in stage I. Typically, they are unilateral until metastasis, which occurs within the peritoneal cavity and via the bloodstream to the lungs. Yolk sac tumors grow quickly and recur easily, and are not easily treatable once they have recurred. Stage I yolk sac tumors are highly treatable, with a 5-year disease-free survival rate of 93%, but stage II-IV tumors are less treatable, with survival rates of 64\u201391%.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nTheir gross appearance is solid, friable, and yellow, with necrotic and hemorrhagic areas. They also often contain cysts that can degenerate or rupture. Histologically, yolk sac tumors are characterized by the presence of [[Schiller\u2013Duval body|Schiller-Duval bodies]] (which are pathognomonic for yolk sac tumors) and a reticular pattern. Yolk sac tumors commonly secrete [[alpha-fetoprotein]] and can be [[Immunohistochemistry|immunohistochemically]] stained for its presence; the level of alpha-fetoprotein in the blood is a useful marker of recurrence.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n===== Embryonal carcinoma =====\n{{Main|Embryonal carcinoma}}\nEmbryonal carcinomas, a rare tumor type usually found in mixed tumors, develop directly from germ cells but are not terminally differentiated; in rare cases they may develop in dysgenetic gonads. They can develop further into a variety of other neoplasms, including choriocarcinoma, yolk sac tumor, and teratoma.

Ovarian cancer metastases usually grow on the surface of organs rather than the inside; they are also common on the omentum and the peritoneal lining. Cancer cells can also travel through the [[lymphatic system]] and metastasize to lymph nodes connected to the ovaries via blood vessels; i.e. the lymph nodes along the [[Suspensory ligament of ovary|infundibulopelvic ligament]], the [[Broad ligament of the uterus|broad ligament]], and the [[Round ligament of uterus|round ligament]]. The most commonly affected groups include the [[paraaortic lymph node|paraaortic]], [[hypogastric lymph node|hypogastric]], [[external iliac lymph nodes|external iliac]], [[obturator lymph nodes|obturator]], and [[inguinal lymph node]]s. Usually, ovarian cancer does not metastasize to the liver, lung, brain, or kidneys unless it is recurrent disease; this differentiates ovarian cancer from many other forms of cancer.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" />\n\n== Screening ==\nThere is no simple and reliable way to test for ovarian cancer in women who do not have any signs or symptoms. Screening is not recommended in women who are at average risk, as evidence does not support a reduction in death and the high rate of false positive tests may lead to unneeded surgery, which is accompanied by its own risks.<ref name=Gros2018/> The [[Pap test]] does not screen for ovarian cancer.<ref name = CDCsep2016/>\n\nOvarian cancer is usually only palpable in advanced stages.<ref name=Hoffman35/>  Screening is not recommended using [[CA-125]] measurements, [[HE4]] levels, ultrasound, or adnexal palpation in women who are at average risk.

Because ambiguous results are more likely than detection of a treatable problem, and because the usual response to ambiguous results is invasive interventions, in women of average risk, the potential harms of having screening without an indication outweigh the potential benefits. The purpose of screening is to diagnose ovarian cancer at an early stage, when it is more likely to be treated successfully.<ref name=Harrisons/><ref name=Harrisons82/>\n\nScreening with [[transvaginal ultrasound]], pelvic examination, and CA-125 levels can be used instead of preventive surgery in women who have BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. This strategy has shown some success.<ref name=Hoffman35/>\n\n== Prevention==\nPeople with strong genetic risk for ovarian cancer may consider the surgical removal of their ovaries as a preventive measure. This is often done after completion of childbearing years. This reduces the chances of developing both breast cancer (by around 50%) and ovarian cancer (by about 96%) in people at high risk. Women with ''BRCA'' gene mutations usually also have their Fallopian tubes removed at the same time (salpingo-oophorectomy), since they also have an increased risk of [[Fallopian tube cancer]]. However, these statistics may overestimate the risk reduction because of how they have been studied.<ref name=Harrisons/><ref name=Harrisons82/>\n\nPeople with a significant family history for ovarian cancer are often referred to a [[genetic counselor]] to see if  testing for BRCA mutations would be beneficial.<ref name=Hoffman35/> The use of oral contraceptives, the absence of 'periods' during the menstrual cycle, and tubal ligation reduce the risk.<ref name=\"CibulaWidschwendter2010\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Cibula D, Widschwendter M, M\u00e1jek O, Dusek L | title = Tubal ligation and the risk of ovarian cancer: review and meta-analysis | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 17 | issue = 1 | pages = 55\u201367 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20634209 | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmq030 | doi-access = free }}</ref>\nThere may an association of developing ovarian cancer and ovarian stimulation during infertility treatments.

The surgery depends upon the extent of nearby invasion of other tissues by the cancer when it is diagnosed. This extent of the cancer is described by assigning it a stage, the presumed type, and the grade of cancer. The gynecological surgeon may  remove one (unilateral oophorectomy) or both ovaries (bilateral oophorectomy). The Fallopian tubes (salpingectomy), uterus (hysterectomy), and the [[Greater omentum|omentum]] (omentectomy) may also be removed. Typically, all of these organs are removed.<ref name=\"CanadianCS2017\" />\n\nFor low-grade, unilateral stage-IA cancers, only the involved ovary (which must be unruptured) and Fallopian tube will be removed. This can be done especially in young people who wish to preserve their fertility. However, a risk of microscopic metastases exists and staging must be completed.<ref name=\"Jayson\" /> If any metastases are found, a second surgery to remove the remaining ovary and uterus is needed.<ref name=\":2\" /> [[Tranexamic acid]] can be administered prior to surgery to reduce the need for blood transfusions due to blood loss during the surgery.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nIf a tumor in a premenopausal woman is determined to be a low malignant potential tumor during surgery, and it is clearly stage I cancer, only the affected ovary is removed. For postmenopausal women with low malignant potential tumors, hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is still the preferred option. During staging, the appendix can be examined or removed. This is particularly important with mucinous tumors.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" /> In children or adolescents with ovarian cancer, surgeons typically attempt to preserve one ovary to allow for the completion of [[puberty]], but if the cancer has spread, this is not always possible. Dysgerminomas, in particular, tend to affect both ovaries: 8\u201315% of dysgerminomas are present in both ovaries.<ref name=\"Current\" /> People with low-grade (well-differentiated) tumors are typically treated only with surgery,<ref name=\"Harrisons\" /> which is often curative.<ref name=\":1\" /> In general, germ cell tumors can be treated with unilateral surgery unless the cancer is widespread or fertility is not a factor.<ref name=\":8\" /> In women with surgically staged advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (stages III and IV), studies suggest all attempts should be made to reach complete cytoreduction (surgical efforts to remove the bulk of the tumor).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Elattar|first=Ahmed|last2=Bryant|first2=Andrew|last3=Winter-Roach|first3=Brett A|last4=Hatem|first4=Mohamed|last5=Naik|first5=Raj|date=2011-08-10|title=Optimal primary surgical treatment for advanced epithelial ovarian cancer|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=8|pages=CD007565|doi=10.1002/14651858.cd007565.pub2|issn=1465-1858|pmc=6457688|pmid=21833960}}</ref>\n\nIn advanced cancers, where complete removal is not an option, as much tumor as possible is removed in a procedure called [[debulking]] surgery. This surgery is not always successful, and is less likely to be successful in women with extensive metastases in the peritoneum, stage- IV disease, cancer in the [[porta hepatis|transverse fissure of the liver]], [[mesentery]], or diaphragm, and large areas of ascites.

This allows chemotherapy to better reach the remaining cancer cells, which are more likely to be fast-growing and therefore chemosensitive.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" />\n\nInterval debulking surgery is another protocol used, where neoadjuvant chemotherapy is given, debulking surgery is performed, and chemotherapy is finished after debulking.<ref name=\":2\" /> Though no definitive studies have been completed, it is shown to be approximately equivalent to primary debulking surgery in terms of survival, and shows slightly lower morbidity.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" />\n\nThere are several different surgical procedures that can be employed to treat ovarian cancer. For stage I and II cancer, laparascopic (keyhole) surgery can be used, but metastases may not be found. For advanced cancer, laparoscopy is not used, since debulking metastases requires access to the entire peritoneal cavity. Depending on the extent of the cancer, procedures may include a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, biopsies throughout the peritoneum and abdominal lymphatic system, [[omentectomy]], [[splenectomy]], [[bowel resection]], [[Diaphragm resection|diaphragm stripping or resection]], [[appendectomy]], or even a posterior [[pelvic exenteration]].<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" />\n\nTo fully stage ovarian cancer, [[lymphadenectomy]] can be included in the surgery, but a significant survival benefit to this practice may not happen.<ref name=Jayson/> This is particularly important in germ cell tumors because they frequently metastasize to nearby lymph nodes.<ref name=Harrisons/>\n\nIf ovarian cancer recurs, secondary surgery is sometimes a treatment option.

There is conflicting evidence for BRCA1 as a prognostic factor. Conversely, negative prognostic factors - those that indicate a worse chance of survival - include rupture of the ovarian capsule during surgery, older age (over 45 years), mucinous type, stage IV, high histologic grade, clear cell type, upper abdominal involvement, high CA-125 levels, the presence of tumor cells in the blood, and elevated [[Cyclooxygenase 2|cyclooxygenase-2]].<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nExpression of various mRNAs can also be prognostic for ovarian cancer. High levels of [[Drosha]] and [[Dicer]] are associated with improved survival, whereas high levels of [[let-7b]], [[HIF1A]], [[EPH receptor A1|EphA1]], and [[Poly ADP ribose polymerase|poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase]] are associated with worse survival.

Overall, in a 5-year period, 20% of stage I and II cancers recur. Most recurrences are in the abdomen.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" /> If a recurrence occurs in advanced disease, it typically occurs within 18 months of initial treatment (18 months [[progression-free survival]]). Recurrences can be treated, but the disease-free interval tends to shorten and chemoresistance increases with each recurrence.<ref name=Jayson/> When a dysgerminoma recurs, it is most likely to recur within a year of diagnosis, and other malignant germ cell tumors recur within 2 years 90% of the time. Germ cell tumors other than dysgerminomas have a poor prognosis when they relapse, with a 10% long-term survival rate.<ref name=\":8\"/> Low malignant potential tumors rarely relapse, even when fertility-sparing surgery is the treatment of choice. 15% of LMP tumors relapse after unilateral surgery in the previously unaffected ovary, and they are typically easily treated with surgery. More advanced tumors may take up to 20 years to relapse, if they relapse at all, and are only treated with surgery unless the tumor has changed its histological characteristics or grown very quickly. In these cases, and when there is significant ascites, chemotherapy may also be used. Relapse is usually indicated by rising CA-125 levels and then progresses to symptomatic relapse within 2\u20136 months.<ref name=Hoffman35/> Recurrent sex cord-stromal tumors are typically unresponsive to treatment but not aggressive.<ref name=\":8\"/>\n\nIt is the most deadly gynecologic cancer.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\">{{cite book |chapter = Epithelial Ovarian Cancer |pages = 853\u2013878 |title = Williams Gynecology |edition = 2nd |publisher = McGraw Hill Medical |first1 = Barbara L. |last1 = Hoffman |first2 = John O. |last2 = Schorge |first3 = Joseph I. |last3 = Schaffer |first4 = Lisa M. |last4 = Halvorson |first5 = Karen D. |last5 = Bradshaw |first6 = F.

A specific chemotherapy regimen for rare clear-cell cancers is also under investigation: [[irinotecan]] combined with cisplatin.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n[[PARP inhibitor]]s have also shown promise in early trials, particularly in people with ''BRCA'' gene mutations, since the BRCA protein interacts with the PARP pathway. It is also being studied in recurrent ovarian cancer in general, where preliminary studies have shown longer PFS. Specifically, [[olaparib]] has shown greater survival compared to doxorubicin, though this treatment is still being investigated. It is not clear yet which [[biomarker]]s are predictive of responsiveness to PARP inhibitors.<ref name=Jayson/> [[Rucaparib]] is another PARP inhibitor being researched in BRCA-positive and BRCA-negative recurrent advanced ovarian cancer. [[Niraparib]] is a PARP inhibitor being tested in BRCA-positive recurrent ovarian cancer.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n[[Tyrosine kinase inhibitors]] are another investigational drug class that may have applications in ovarian cancer. Angiogenesis inhibitors in the [[receptor tyrosine kinase]] inhibitor group, including [[pazopanib]], [[cediranib]], and [[nintedanib]], have also been shown to increase progression free survival (PFS), but their benefit for overall survival has not been investigated as of 2015.<ref name=\"Jayson\" /> Preliminary research showed that cediranib combined with platins in recurrent ovarian cancer increased the time to second recurrence by 3\u20134 months and increased survival by 3 months.<ref name=\":6\" /> [[MK-1775]] is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is being used in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin in platinum-sensitive cancers with p53 mutations. [[Nintedanib]] is being researched as a potential therapy in combination with cyclophosphamide for people with recurrences.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n[[Histone deacetylase inhibitor]]s (HDACi) are another area of research.\n\n===Hormones and radiation===\nHormone therapies are a topic of current research in ovarian cancer, particularly, the value of certain medications used to treat breast cancer. These include [[tamoxifen]], [[letrozole]], and [[anastrozole]]. Preliminary studies have showed a benefit for tamoxifen in a small number of people with advanced ovarian cancer. Letrozole may help to slow or stop growth of [[estrogen receptor]] positive ovarian cancer. Anastrozole is being investigated in postmenopausal people with estrogen receptor-positive cancer.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nResearch into mitigating side effects of ovarian cancer treatment is also ongoing. [[Radiation fibrosis]], the formation of scar tissue in an area treated with radiation, may be relieved with [[Hyperbaric medicine|hyperbaric oxygen therapy]], but research has not been completed in this area. Treatment of ovarian cancer may also cause people to experience psychiatric difficulties, including [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. Research is ongoing to determine how counseling and psychotherapy can help people who have ovarian cancer during treatment.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n===Inflammation===\n\nThere are some indications that pelvic inflammatory disease may be associated with ovarian cancer, especially in non-western countries. It may be due to the inflammatory process present with pelvic inflammatory disease.<ref name=\"IngerslevHogdall2017\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ingerslev K, Hogdall E, Schnack TH, Skovrider-Ruminski W, Hogdall C, Blaakaer J | title = The potential role of infectious agents and pelvic inflammatory disease in ovarian carcinogenesis | journal = Infectious Agents and Cancer | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 25 | year = 2017 | pmid = 28529540 | pmc = 5437405 | doi = 10.1186/s13027-017-0134-9 }}</ref>\n\n===Clinical trials===\n[[Clinical trial]]s are monitored and funded by US governmental organizations to test treatment options to see if they are safe and effective.

Sex cord-stromal tumors  in prepubertal children may be manifested by [[precocious puberty|early puberty]]; abdominal pain and distension are also common.

Thus [[Nulliparity|not having children]] is a risk factor for ovarian cancer, likely because ovulation is suppressed via pregnancy.  During ovulation, cells are constantly stimulated to divide while ovulatory cycles continue.

Histologically, they are similar to intestinal or cervical adenocarcinomas and are often actually metastases of [[appendiceal cancer|appendiceal]] or [[colon cancer]]s. Advanced mucinous adenocarcinomas have a poor prognosis, generally worse than serous tumors, and are often resistant to platinum chemotherapy, though they are rare.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" />\n\n====== Pseudomyxoma peritonei ======\n{{Main|Pseudomyxoma peritonei}}\n\n''Pseudomyxoma peritonei'' refers to a collection of encapsulated mucous or gelatinous material in the abdominopelvic cavity, which is very rarely caused by a primary mucinous ovarian tumor. More commonly, it is associated with ovarian metastases of intestinal cancer.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" />\n\n===== Undifferentiated epithelial =====\nUndifferentiated cancers - those where the cell type cannot be determined - make up about 10% of epithelial ovarian cancers and have a comparatively poor prognosis.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> When examined under the microscope, these tumors have very abnormal cells that are arranged in clumps or sheets. Usually there are recognizable clumps of serous cells inside the tumor.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" />\n\n====== Malignant Brenner tumor ======\n{{Main|Brenner tumor}}\n\nMalignant Brenner tumors are rare. Histologically, they have dense fibrous stroma with areas of transitional epithelium, and some squamous differentiation. To be classified as a malignant Brenner tumor, it must have Brenner tumor foci and transitional cell carcinoma. The transitional cell carcinoma component is typically poorly differentiated and resembles urinary tract cancer.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" />\n\n====== Transitional cell carcinoma ======\n{{Main|Transitional cell carcinoma}}\n\nTransitional cell carcinomas represent less than 5% of ovarian cancers.

Sex cord-stromal tumors are the main hormone-producing ovarian tumors.<ref name=\":8\">{{harvnb|Williams Gynecology|2012}}</ref>\n\nSeveral different cells from the [[mesenchyme]] can give rise to sex-cord or stromal tumors. These include [[fibroblast]]s and endocrine cells. The symptoms of a sex-cord or stromal ovarian tumor can differ from other types of ovarian cancer. Common signs and symptoms include [[ovarian torsion]], [[hemorrhage]] from or rupture of the tumor, an abdominal mass, and hormonal disruption. In children, [[precocious puberty#Isosexual and heterosexual|isosexual precocious pseudopuberty]] may occur with granulosa cell tumors since they produce estrogen. These tumors cause abnormalities in menstruation ([[menometrorrhagia|excessive bleeding]], [[oligomenorrhea|infrequent menstruation]], or [[amenorrhea|no menstruation]]) or postmenopausal bleeding. Because these tumors produce estrogen, they can cause or occur at the same time as [[endometrial cancer]] or [[breast cancer]]. Other sex-cord/stromal tumors present with distinct symptoms. Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors cause [[virilization]] and [[hirsutism|excessive hair growth]] due to the production of [[testosterone]] and [[androstenedione]], which can also cause [[Cushing's syndrome]] in rare cases. Also, sex-cord stromal tumors occur that do not cause a hormonal imbalance, including benign fibromas, which cause ascites and [[hydrothorax]].<ref name=Harrisons/> With germ cell tumors, sex cord-stromal tumors are the most common ovarian cancer diagnosed in women under 20.<ref name=\":8\"/>\n\n===== Granulosa cell tumor =====\nGranulosa cell tumors are the most common sex-cord stromal tumors, making up 70% of cases, and are divided into two histologic subtypes: adult granulosa cell tumors, which develop in women over 50, and juvenile granulosa tumors, which develop before puberty or before the age of 30. Both develop in the [[ovarian follicle]] from a population of cells that surrounds [[germinal cell]]s.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n====== Adult granulosa cell tumor ======\nAdult granulosa cell tumors are characterized by later onset (30+ years, 50 on average). These tumors produce high levels of estrogen, which causes its characteristic symptoms: [[menometrorrhagia]]; [[endometrial hyperplasia]]; [[Breast pain|tender]], [[Breast enlargement|enlarged breasts]]; [[Vaginal bleeding|postmenopausal bleeding]]; and [[Amenorrhoea|secondary amenorrhea]]. The mass of the tumor can cause other symptoms, including abdominal pain and distension, or symptoms similar to an [[ectopic pregnancy]] if the tumor bleeds and ruptures.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n====== Juvenile granulosa cell tumor ======\n\n===== Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor =====\nSertoli-Leydig tumors are most common in women before the age of 30, and particularly common before puberty.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n===== Sclerosing stromal tumors =====\nSclerosing stromal tumors  typically occur in girls before puberty or women before the age of 30.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n==== Germ cell tumor ====\n{{Main|Ovarian germ cell tumors}}\nGerm cell tumors of the ovary develop from the ovarian [[germ cells]].<ref name=\":1\" /> [[Germ cell tumor]] accounts for about 30% of ovarian tumors, but only 5% of ovarian cancers, because most germ-cell tumors are [[teratoma]]s and most teratomas are benign.

Some germ-cell tumors have an [[isochromosome]] 12, where one arm of chromosome 12 is deleted and replaced with a duplicate of the other.<ref name=Harrisons/> Most germ-cell cancers have a better prognosis than other subtypes and are more sensitive to chemotherapy. They are more likely to be stage I at diagnosis.<ref name=\":8\" /> Overall, they metastasize more frequently than epithelial ovarian cancers. In addition, the cancer markers used vary with tumor type: [[choriocarcinomas]] are monitored with [[beta-HCG]] and endodermal sinus tumors with [[alpha-fetoprotein]].<ref name=Harrisons/>\n\nGerm-cell tumors are typically discovered when they become large, palpable masses. However, like sex cord tumors, they can cause ovarian torsion or hemorrhage and, in children, isosexual precocious puberty. They frequently metastasize to nearby lymph nodes, especially para-aortic and pelvic lymph nodes.<ref name=Harrisons/> The most common symptom of germ cell tumors is [[Abdominal pain|subacute abdominal pain]] caused by the tumor bleeding, [[Necrosis|necrotizing]], or stretching the [[ovarian capsule]]. If the tumor ruptures, causes significant bleeding, or torses the ovary, it can cause [[Acute abdomen|acute abdominal pain]], which occurs in less than 10% of those with germ-cell tumors. They can also secrete hormones which change the [[menstrual cycle]]. In 25% of germ-cell tumors, the cancer is discovered during a [[Well-woman examination|routine examination]] and does not cause symptoms.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nDiagnosing germ cell tumors may be difficult because the normal menstrual cycle and [[puberty]] can cause pain and pelvic symptoms, and a young woman may even believe these symptoms to be those of pregnancy, and not seek treatment due to the stigma of [[Teenage pregnancy|teen pregnancy]]. Blood tests for alpha-fetoprotein, [[karyotype]], human chorionic gonadotropin, and liver function are used to diagnose germ cell tumor and potential co-occurring gonadal dysgenesis. A germ cell tumor may be initially mistaken for a benign [[ovarian cyst]].<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n===== Dysgerminoma =====\n{{Main|Dysgerminoma}}\nDysgerminoma accounts for 35% of ovarian cancer in young women and is the most likely germ cell tumor to metastasize to the lymph nodes; nodal metastases occur in 25\u201330% of cases.<ref name=Current/><ref name=\":8\" /> These tumors may have mutations in [[CD117|the ''KIT'' gene]], a mutation known for its role in [[gastrointestinal stromal tumor]]. [[Swyer syndrome|People with an XY karyotype and ovaries]] ([[gonadal dysgenesis]]) or an X,0 karyotype and ovaries ([[Turner syndrome]]) who develop a unilateral dysgerminoma are at risk for a [[gonadoblastoma]] in the other ovary, and in this case, both ovaries are usually removed when a unilateral dysgerminoma is discovered to avoid the risk of another malignant tumor. Gonadoblastomas in people with Swyer or Turner syndrome become malignant in approximately 40% of cases. However, in general, dysgerminomas are bilateral 10\u201320% of the time.<ref name=Harrisons/><ref name=\":8\" />\n\nThey are composed of cells that cannot [[Cellular differentiation|differentiate]] further and develop directly from germ cells or from gonadoblastomas. Dysgerminomas contain [[syncytiotrophoblast]]s in approximately 5% of cases, and can therefore cause elevated hCG levels. On gross appearance, dysgerminomas are typically pink to tan-colored, have multiple lobes, and are solid. Microscopically, they appear identical to [[seminoma]]s and very close to [[Embryonic germ cell|embryonic primordial germ cells]], having large, polyhedral, rounded [[clear cell]]s. The nuclei are uniform and round or square with prominent [[Nucleolus|nucleoli]] and the [[cytoplasm]] has high levels of [[glycogen]]. Inflammation is another prominent histologic feature of dysgerminomas.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n===== Choriocarcinoma =====\n{{Main|Choriocarcinoma}}\nChoriocarcinoma can occur as a primary ovarian tumor developing from a germ cell, though it is usually a gestational disease that metastasizes to the ovary. Primary ovarian choriocarcinoma has  a poor prognosis and can occur without a pregnancy. They produce high levels of hCG and can cause [[Precocious puberty|early puberty]] in children or [[menometrorrhagia]] (irregular, heavy menstruation) after menarche.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n===== Immature (solid) teratoma =====\n{{Main|Immature teratoma}}Immature, or solid, teratomas are the most common type of ovarian germ cell tumor, making up 40\u201350% of cases. Teratomas are characterized by the presence of disorganized tissues arising from all three embryonic [[germ layer]]s: [[ectoderm]], [[mesoderm]], and [[endoderm]]; immature teratomas also have undifferentiated [[stem cell]]s that make them more malignant than mature teratomas (dermoid cysts). The different tissues are visible on gross pathology and often include bone, cartilage, hair, [[mucus]], or [[Sebaceous gland|sebum]], but these tissues are not visible from the outside, which appears to be a solid mass with lobes and cysts. Histologically, they have large amounts of [[neuroectoderm]] organized into sheets and tubules along with [[Neuroglia|glia]]; the amount of neural tissue determines the histologic grade. Immature teratomas usually only affect one ovary (10% co-occur with dermoid cysts) and usually metastasize throughout the peritoneum. They can also cause mature teratoma implants to grow throughout the abdomen in a disease called [[growing teratoma syndrome]]; these are usually benign but will continue to grow during chemotherapy, and often necessitate further surgery. Unlike mature teratomas, immature teratomas form many [[Adhesion (medicine)|adhesions]], making them less likely to cause ovarian torsion. There is no specific marker for immature teratomas, but [[carcinoembryonic antigen]] (CEA), CA-125, CA19-9, or AFP can sometimes indicate an immature teratoma.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nStage I teratomas make up the majority (75%) of cases and have the best prognosis, with 98% of patients surviving 5 years; if a Stage I tumor is also grade 1, it can be treated with unilateral surgery only. Stage II though IV tumors make up the remaining quarter of cases and have a worse prognosis,  with 73\u201388% of patients surviving 5 years.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n===== Mature teratoma (dermoid cyst) =====\n{{Main|Dermoid cyst}}\nMature teratomas, or dermoid cysts, are rare tumors consisting of mostly benign tissue that develop after menopause. The tumors consist of disorganized tissue with nodules of malignant tissue, which can be of various types. The most common malignancy is [[Squamous-cell carcinoma|squamous cell carcinoma]], but [[adenocarcinoma]], [[basal-cell carcinoma]], [[Carcinoid|carcinoid tumor]], [[neuroectodermal tumor]], [[Melanoma|malignant melanoma]], [[sarcoma]], [[Sebaceous carcinoma|sebaceous tumor]], and [[struma ovarii]] can also be part of the dermoid cyst. They are treated with surgery and adjuvant platinum chemotherapy or radiation.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n===== Yolk sac tumor/endodermal sinus tumor =====\n{{Main|Yolk sac tumor}}\n[[Yolk sac]] tumors, formerly called endodermal sinus tumors, make up approximately 10\u201320% of ovarian germ cell malignancies, and have the worst prognosis of all [[ovarian germ cell tumors]]. They occur both before menarche (in one-third of cases) and after menarche (the remaining two-thirds of cases). Half of the people with yolk sac tumors are diagnosed in stage I. Typically, they are unilateral until metastasis, which occurs within the peritoneal cavity and via the bloodstream to the lungs. Yolk sac tumors grow quickly and recur easily, and are not easily treatable once they have recurred. Stage I yolk sac tumors are highly treatable, with a 5-year disease-free survival rate of 93%, but stage II-IV tumors are less treatable, with survival rates of 64\u201391%.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nTheir gross appearance is solid, friable, and yellow, with necrotic and hemorrhagic areas. They also often contain cysts that can degenerate or rupture. Histologically, yolk sac tumors are characterized by the presence of [[Schiller\u2013Duval body|Schiller-Duval bodies]] (which are pathognomonic for yolk sac tumors) and a reticular pattern. Yolk sac tumors commonly secrete [[alpha-fetoprotein]] and can be [[Immunohistochemistry|immunohistochemically]] stained for its presence; the level of alpha-fetoprotein in the blood is a useful marker of recurrence.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n===== Embryonal carcinoma =====\n{{Main|Embryonal carcinoma}}\nEmbryonal carcinomas, a rare tumor type usually found in mixed tumors, develop directly from germ cells but are not terminally differentiated; in rare cases they may develop in dysgenetic gonads. They can develop further into a variety of other neoplasms, including choriocarcinoma, yolk sac tumor, and teratoma. They occur in younger people, with an average age at diagnosis of 14, and secrete both alpha-fetoprotein (in 75% of cases) and hCG.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nHistologically, embryonal carcinoma appears similar to the [[embryonic disc]], made up of epithelial, [[Anaplasia|anaplastic]] cells in disorganized sheets, with gland-like spaces and papillary structures.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n===== Polyembryoma =====\n{{Main|Polyembryoma}}\nPolyembryomas, the most immature form of teratoma and very rare ovarian tumors, are histologically characterized by having several [[embryo]]-like bodies with structures resembling a [[germ disk]], [[yolk sac]], and [[amniotic sac]]. [[Syncytiotrophoblast|Syncytiotrophoblast giant cells]] also occur in polyembryomas.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n==== Squamous cell carcinoma ====\nPrimary ovarian squamous cell carcinomas are rare and have a poor prognosis when advanced. More typically, ovarian squamous cell carcinomas are cervical metastases, areas of differentiation in an endometrioid tumor, or derived from a mature teratoma.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" />\n\n==== Mixed tumors ====\nMixed tumors contain elements of more than one of the above classes of tumor histology. To be classed as a mixed tumor, the minor type must make up more than 10% of the tumor.<ref name=\":7\" /> Though mixed carcinomas can have any combination of cell types, mixed ovarian cancers are typically serous/endometrioid or clear cell/endometrioid.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" /> Mixed germ cell tumors make up approximately 25\u201330% of all germ cell ovarian cancers, with combinations of dysgerminoma, yolk sac tumor, and/or immature teratoma. The prognosis and treatment vary based on the component cell types.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n==== Secondary ovarian cancer ====\nOvarian cancer can also be a secondary cancer, the result of [[metastasis]] from a primary cancer elsewhere in the body.<ref name=Harrisons/> About 7% of ovarian cancers are due to metastases, while the rest are primary cancers.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Common primary cancers are [[breast cancer]], [[colon cancer]], [[appendiceal cancer]], and [[stomach cancer]] (primary gastric cancers that metastasize to the ovary are called [[Krukenberg tumor]]s).<ref name=Harrisons/> Krukenberg tumors have signet ring cells and mucinous cells.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" /> Endometrial cancer and lymphomas can also metastasize to the ovary.<ref name=Levy>{{Cite book|title = Premalignant & Malignant Disorders of the Ovaries & Oviducts|last = Levy|first = Gary | name-list-format = vanc |publisher = McGraw-Hill|year = 2013|last2 = Purcell|last3 = Karen|work = CURRENT Diagnosis & Treatment: Obstetrics & Gynecology, 11e| veditors = DeCherney AH, Nathan L, Laufer N, Roman AS |url = http://accessmedicine.mhmedical.com/content.aspx?bookid=498&sectionid=41008645|isbn = 978-0-07-163856-2|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170910175639/http://accessmedicine.mhmedical.com/content.aspx?bookid=498&sectionid=41008645|archivedate = 2017-09-10}}</ref>\n\n==== Borderline tumors====\nOvarian [[borderline tumor]]s, sometimes called low malignant potential (LMP) ovarian tumors, have some benign and some malignant features.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" /> LMP tumors make up approximately 10%-15% of all ovarian tumors.<ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> They develop earlier than epithelial ovarian cancer, around the age of 40\u201349. They typically do not have extensive invasion; 10% of LMP tumors have areas of stromal microinvasion (<3mm, <5% of tumor). LMP tumors have other abnormal features, including increased mitosis, [[pleomorphism (cytology)|changes in cell size or nucleus size]], [[nuclear atypia|abnormal nuclei]], cell stratification, and [[papillary projections|small projections on cells]] (papillary projections). Serous and/or mucinous characteristics can be seen on histological examination, and serous histology makes up the overwhelming majority of advanced LMP tumors. More than 80% of LMP tumors are Stage I; 15% are stage II and III and less than 5% are stage IV.<ref name=Hoffman35/> Implants of LMP tumors are often non-invasive.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Staging ===\nOvarian cancer is staged using the [[International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics|FIGO]] staging system and uses information obtained after surgery, which can include a total [[Hysterectomy|abdominal hysterectomy]] via [[Laparotomy|midline laparotomy]], [[Salpingoophorectomy|removal of (usually) both ovaries and Fallopian tubes]], [[Omentectomy|(usually) the omentum]], [[pelvic washing|pelvic (peritoneal) washing]]s, assessment of [[Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection|retroperitoneal lymph nodes]] (including the [[Pelvic lymph nodes|pelvic]] and [[Paraaortic lymph node|para-aortic lymph nodes]]), [[appendectomy]] in suspected mucinous tumors, and pelvic/peritoneal biopsies for [[cytopathology]].<ref name=Jayson/><ref name=Harrisons/><ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=SGO/> Around 30% of ovarian cancers that appear confined to the ovary have metastasized microscopically, which is why even stage-I cancers must be staged completely.<ref name=Harrisons/> 22% of cancers presumed to be stage I are observed to have lymphatic metastases.<ref name=\":7\" /> The AJCC stage is the same as the FIGO stage.

Ovarian cancer metastases usually grow on the surface of organs rather than the inside; they are also common on the omentum and the peritoneal lining. Cancer cells can also travel through the [[lymphatic system]] and metastasize to lymph nodes connected to the ovaries via blood vessels; i.e. the lymph nodes along the [[Suspensory ligament of ovary|infundibulopelvic ligament]], the [[Broad ligament of the uterus|broad ligament]], and the [[Round ligament of uterus|round ligament]]. The most commonly affected groups include the [[paraaortic lymph node|paraaortic]], [[hypogastric lymph node|hypogastric]], [[external iliac lymph nodes|external iliac]], [[obturator lymph nodes|obturator]], and [[inguinal lymph node]]s. Usually, ovarian cancer does not metastasize to the liver, lung, brain, or kidneys unless it is recurrent disease; this differentiates ovarian cancer from many other forms of cancer.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" />\n\n== Screening ==\nThere is no simple and reliable way to test for ovarian cancer in women who do not have any signs or symptoms. Screening is not recommended in women who are at average risk, as evidence does not support a reduction in death and the high rate of false positive tests may lead to unneeded surgery, which is accompanied by its own risks.<ref name=Gros2018/> The [[Pap test]] does not screen for ovarian cancer.<ref name = CDCsep2016/>\n\nOvarian cancer is usually only palpable in advanced stages.<ref name=Hoffman35/>  Screening is not recommended using [[CA-125]] measurements, [[HE4]] levels, ultrasound, or adnexal palpation in women who are at average risk.

Because ambiguous results are more likely than detection of a treatable problem, and because the usual response to ambiguous results is invasive interventions, in women of average risk, the potential harms of having screening without an indication outweigh the potential benefits. The purpose of screening is to diagnose ovarian cancer at an early stage, when it is more likely to be treated successfully.<ref name=Harrisons/><ref name=Harrisons82/>\n\nScreening with [[transvaginal ultrasound]], pelvic examination, and CA-125 levels can be used instead of preventive surgery in women who have BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations.

This is often done after completion of childbearing years. This reduces the chances of developing both breast cancer (by around 50%) and ovarian cancer (by about 96%) in people at high risk. Women with ''BRCA'' gene mutations usually also have their Fallopian tubes removed at the same time (salpingo-oophorectomy), since they also have an increased risk of [[Fallopian tube cancer]]. However, these statistics may overestimate the risk reduction because of how they have been studied.<ref name=Harrisons/><ref name=Harrisons82/>\n\nPeople with a significant family history for ovarian cancer are often referred to a [[genetic counselor]] to see if  testing for BRCA mutations would be beneficial.<ref name=Hoffman35/> The use of oral contraceptives, the absence of 'periods' during the menstrual cycle, and tubal ligation reduce the risk.<ref name=\"CibulaWidschwendter2010\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Cibula D, Widschwendter M, M\u00e1jek O, Dusek L | title = Tubal ligation and the risk of ovarian cancer: review and meta-analysis | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 17 | issue = 1 | pages = 55\u201367 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20634209 | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmq030 | doi-access = free }}</ref>\nThere may an association of developing ovarian cancer and ovarian stimulation during infertility treatments.

The surgery depends upon the extent of nearby invasion of other tissues by the cancer when it is diagnosed. This extent of the cancer is described by assigning it a stage, the presumed type, and the grade of cancer. The gynecological surgeon may  remove one (unilateral oophorectomy) or both ovaries (bilateral oophorectomy). The Fallopian tubes (salpingectomy), uterus (hysterectomy), and the [[Greater omentum|omentum]] (omentectomy) may also be removed. Typically, all of these organs are removed.<ref name=\"CanadianCS2017\" />\n\nFor low-grade, unilateral stage-IA cancers, only the involved ovary (which must be unruptured) and Fallopian tube will be removed. This can be done especially in young people who wish to preserve their fertility. However, a risk of microscopic metastases exists and staging must be completed.<ref name=\"Jayson\" /> If any metastases are found, a second surgery to remove the remaining ovary and uterus is needed.<ref name=\":2\" /> [[Tranexamic acid]] can be administered prior to surgery to reduce the need for blood transfusions due to blood loss during the surgery.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nIf a tumor in a premenopausal woman is determined to be a low malignant potential tumor during surgery, and it is clearly stage I cancer, only the affected ovary is removed. For postmenopausal women with low malignant potential tumors, hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is still the preferred option. During staging, the appendix can be examined or removed. This is particularly important with mucinous tumors.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" /> In children or adolescents with ovarian cancer, surgeons typically attempt to preserve one ovary to allow for the completion of [[puberty]], but if the cancer has spread, this is not always possible.

For stage I and II cancer, laparascopic (keyhole) surgery can be used, but metastases may not be found. For advanced cancer, laparoscopy is not used, since debulking metastases requires access to the entire peritoneal cavity. Depending on the extent of the cancer, procedures may include a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, biopsies throughout the peritoneum and abdominal lymphatic system, [[omentectomy]], [[splenectomy]], [[bowel resection]], [[Diaphragm resection|diaphragm stripping or resection]], [[appendectomy]], or even a posterior [[pelvic exenteration]].<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" />\n\nTo fully stage ovarian cancer, [[lymphadenectomy]] can be included in the surgery, but a significant survival benefit to this practice may not happen.<ref name=Jayson/> This is particularly important in germ cell tumors because they frequently metastasize to nearby lymph nodes.<ref name=Harrisons/>\n\nIf ovarian cancer recurs, secondary surgery is sometimes a treatment option.

Chemotherapy is used after surgery to treat any residual disease, if appropriate.  In some cases, there may be reason to perform chemotherapy first, followed by surgery.

It is disproportionately deadly because it lacks any clear early detection or screening test, meaning most cases are not diagnosed until they have reached advanced stages.<ref name=\"SGOfive\"/><ref name=Jayson/>\n\nOvarian cancer metastasizes early in its development, often before it has been diagnosed. High-grade tumors metastasize more readily than low-grade tumors. Typically, tumor cells begin to metastasize by growing in the peritoneal cavity.<ref name=Harrisons/> More than 60% of women presenting with ovarian cancer have stage-III or stage-IV cancer, when it has already spread beyond the ovaries. Ovarian cancers shed cells into the naturally occurring fluid within the abdominal cavity. These cells can then implant on other abdominal (peritoneal) structures, including the uterus, [[urinary bladder]], [[bowel]],  [[mesentery|lining of the bowel wall]], and [[Greater omentum|omentum]], forming new tumor growths before cancer is even suspected.\n\nThe five-year survival rate for all stages of ovarian cancer is 46%; the one-year survival rate is 72% and the ten-year survival rate is 35%.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Statistics and outlook for ovarian cancer|url = http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/type/ovarian-cancer/treatment/statistics-and-outlook-for-ovarian-cancer|website = www.cancerresearchuk.org|accessdate = 2015-05-16|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150518192429/http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/type/ovarian-cancer/treatment/statistics-and-outlook-for-ovarian-cancer|archivedate = 2015-05-18}}</ref> For cases where a diagnosis is made early in the disease, when the cancer is still confined to the primary site, the five-year survival rate is 92.7%.<ref name=\"SEER\">Survival rates based on SEER incidence and NCHS mortality statistics, as cited by the National Cancer Institute in [http://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/ovary.html SEER Stat Fact Sheets&nbsp;\u2014 Cancer of the Ovary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140706145616/http://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/ovary.html |date=2014-07-06 }}</ref> About 70% of women with advanced disease respond to initial treatment, most of whom attain complete remission, but half of these women experience a recurrence 1\u20134 years after treatment.<ref name=Harrisons/> [[Brain metastasis]] is more common in stage III/IV cancer but can still occur in cancers staged at I/II. People with brain metastases survive a median of 8.2 months, though surgery, chemotherapy, and [[Whole brain radiotherapy|whole brain radiation therapy]] can improve survival.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nOvarian cancer survival varies significantly with subtype. Dysgerminomas have a very favorable prognosis. In early stages, they have a five-year survival rate of 96.9%.<ref name=Current/> Around two-thirds of dysgerminomas are diagnosed at stage I.<ref name=\":8\" /> Stage-III dysgerminomas have a five-year survival of 61%; when treated with BEP chemotherapy after incomplete surgical removal, dysgerminomas have a 95% two-year survival rate. Sex-cord-stromal malignancies also have a favorable prognosis; because they are slow-growing, even those with metastatic disease can survive a decade or more.<ref name=Harrisons/> Low malignant potential tumors usually only have a bad prognosis when there are invasive tumor implants found in the peritoneal cavity.<ref name=Hoffman35/>\n\nComplications of ovarian cancer can include spread of the cancer to other organs, progressive function loss of various organs, ascites, and intestinal obstructions, which can be fatal. Intestinal obstructions in multiple sites are the most common proximate cause of death.<ref name=Jayson/> Intestinal obstruction in ovarian cancer can either be a true obstruction, where tumor blocks the [[intestinal lumen]], or a pseudo-obstruction, when tumor prevents normal [[peristalsis]].<ref>{{cite book |last1 = Gucalp |first1 = Rasim |last2 = Dutcher |first2 = Janice | name-list-format = vanc |chapter = Oncologic Emergencies |veditors = Longo DL, Kasper DL, Jameson JL, Fauci AS, Hauser SL, Loscalzo J |title = Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine |publisher = McGraw-Hill |year = 2012 |edition = 18th |isbn = 978-0-07-174889-6|title-link = Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine }}</ref> Continuous accumulation of ascites can be treated by placing a drain that can be self-drained.<ref name=Jayson/>\n\n=== Prognostic factors ===\nThere are a number of [[prognostic factor]]s in ovarian cancer. Positive prognostic factors - those indicating better chances of survival - include no residual disease after surgery (stage III/IV), complete macroscopic resection (stage IV), BRCA2 mutations, young age (under 45 years), nonserous type, low histologic grade, early stage, co-occurrence with endometrial cancer, and low CA-125 levels. There is conflicting evidence for BRCA1 as a prognostic factor. Conversely, negative prognostic factors - those that indicate a worse chance of survival - include rupture of the ovarian capsule during surgery, older age (over 45 years), mucinous type, stage IV, high histologic grade, clear cell type, upper abdominal involvement, high CA-125 levels, the presence of tumor cells in the blood, and elevated [[Cyclooxygenase 2|cyclooxygenase-2]].<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nExpression of various mRNAs can also be prognostic for ovarian cancer. High levels of [[Drosha]] and [[Dicer]] are associated with improved survival, whereas high levels of [[let-7b]], [[HIF1A]], [[EPH receptor A1|EphA1]], and [[Poly ADP ribose polymerase|poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase]] are associated with worse survival. Cancers that are positive for [[WT1]] carry a worse prognosis; estrogen-receptor positive cancers have a better prognosis.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Survival rates ===\nOverall five-year survival rates for all types of ovarian cancer are presented below by stage and histologic grade:<ref name=Harrisons/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"left\" style=\"text-align: center; margin-right: 10px;\"\n!

Overall, in a 5-year period, 20% of stage I and II cancers recur. Most recurrences are in the abdomen.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" /> If a recurrence occurs in advanced disease, it typically occurs within 18 months of initial treatment (18 months [[progression-free survival]]). Recurrences can be treated, but the disease-free interval tends to shorten and chemoresistance increases with each recurrence.<ref name=Jayson/> When a dysgerminoma recurs, it is most likely to recur within a year of diagnosis, and other malignant germ cell tumors recur within 2 years 90% of the time. Germ cell tumors other than dysgerminomas have a poor prognosis when they relapse, with a 10% long-term survival rate.<ref name=\":8\"/> Low malignant potential tumors rarely relapse, even when fertility-sparing surgery is the treatment of choice. 15% of LMP tumors relapse after unilateral surgery in the previously unaffected ovary, and they are typically easily treated with surgery. More advanced tumors may take up to 20 years to relapse, if they relapse at all, and are only treated with surgery unless the tumor has changed its histological characteristics or grown very quickly. In these cases, and when there is significant ascites, chemotherapy may also be used. Relapse is usually indicated by rising CA-125 levels and then progresses to symptomatic relapse within 2\u20136 months.<ref name=Hoffman35/> Recurrent sex cord-stromal tumors are typically unresponsive to treatment but not aggressive.<ref name=\":8\"/>\n\nIt is the most deadly gynecologic cancer.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\">{{cite book |chapter = Epithelial Ovarian Cancer |pages = 853\u2013878 |title = Williams Gynecology |edition = 2nd |publisher = McGraw Hill Medical |first1 = Barbara L. |last1 = Hoffman |first2 = John O. |last2 = Schorge |first3 = Joseph I. |last3 = Schaffer |first4 = Lisa M. |last4 = Halvorson |first5 = Karen D. |last5 = Bradshaw |first6 = F.

One major problem with screening is no clear progression of the disease from stage I (noninvasive) to stage III (invasive) is seen, and it may not be possible to find cancers before they reach stage III. Another problem is that screening methods tend to find too many suspicious lesions, most of which are not cancer, but malignancy can only be assessed with surgery.<ref name=Jayson/> The ROCA method combined with transvaginal ultrasonography is being researched in high-risk women to determine if it is a viable screening method. It is also being investigated in normal-risk women as it has shown promise in the wider population.<ref name=Hoffman35/> Studies are also in progress to determine if screening helps detect cancer earlier in people with BRCA mutations.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n===Prognosis research===\nResearch into various [[prognostic factor]]s for ovarian cancer is also going on. Recent research shows that [[thrombocytosis]] predicts lower survival and higher stage cancer.<ref name=Jayson/> Ongoing research is also investigating the benefits of surgery for recurrent ovarian cancer.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n===Immunotherapy===\nWhile an active area of research, as of 2018 there is no goodevidence that [[immunotherapy]] is effective for ovarian cancer.<ref name=\"pmid30199097\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Paijens ST, Leffers N, Daemen T, Helfrich W, Boezen HM, Cohlen BJ, Melief CJ, de Bruyn M, Nijman HW | title = Antigen-specific active immunotherapy for ovarian cancer | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = CD007287 | date = September 2018 | pmid = 30199097 | pmc = 6513204 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD007287.pub4 }}</ref> However, trials of the antibody and [[VEGF]] inhibitor [[bevacizumab]], which can slow the [[angiogenesis|growth of new blood vessels]] in the cancer, have shown promising results, especially in combination with [[pazopanib]], which also slows the process of blood vessel growth. Bevacizumab has been particularly effective in preliminary studies on stage-III and -IV cancer<ref name=Jayson/> and has been cited as having at least a 15% response rate.<ref name=Harrisons/> It is being investigated particularly in mucinous ovarian cancers.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n===Pharmacology===\n[[mTOR inhibitor]]s were a highly investigated potential treatment in the 2000s and 2010s, but the side effects of these drugs (particularly [[hyperglycemia]] and [[hyperlipidemia]]) were not well tolerated and the survival benefit not confirmed. PI3 kinase inhibitors have been of interest, but they tend to be highly toxic and cause [[diarrhea]]. Another investigated drug is [[selumetinib]], a [[MAPK]] inhibitor. It improved survival, but did not correlate with any mutations found in tumors.<ref name=Jayson/>\n\nBevacizumab can also be combined with platinum chemotherapy, a combination that has had positive preliminary results in PFS, but equivocal results regarding overall survival. One disadvantage to these treatments is the side effect profile, which includes [[hypertension|high blood pressure]] and [[proteinuria]]. The drug can also exacerbate bowel disease, leading to [[fistula]]e or [[bowel perforation]]. [[Vintafolide]], which consists of an [[antifolate]] conjugated with [[vinblastine]], is also in clinical trials; it may prove beneficial because [[folate receptor]]s are overexpressed in many ovarian cancers.<ref name=Jayson/> Another potential immunotherapy is [[trastuzumab]], which is active against tumors positive for Her2/neu mutations.<ref name=Harrisons/> Other angiogenesis inhibitors are also being investigated as potential ovarian cancer treatments. [[Combretastatin]] and [[pazopanib]] are being researched in combination for recurrent ovarian cancer. [[Trebananib]] and [[tasquinimod]] are other angiogenesis inhibitors being investigated. The [[monoclonal antibody]] [[farletuzumab]] is being researched as an adjuvant to traditional chemotherapy. Another type of immunotherapy involves [[vaccines]], including [[TroVax]].<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nAn alternative to BEP chemotherapy, a regimen of 3 cycles of [[carboplatin]] and [[etoposide]], is a current topic of research for germ cell malignancies.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n[[Intraperitoneal chemotherapy]] has also been under investigation during the 2000s and 2010s for its potential to deliver higher doses of cytotoxic agent to tumors. Preliminary trials with cisplatin and paclitaxel have shown it is not well tolerated, but does improve survival, and more tolerable regimens are being researched.<ref name=Jayson/> Cisplatin and paclitaxel are both being researched as intraperitoneal chemotherapy agents. A specific chemotherapy regimen for rare clear-cell cancers is also under investigation: [[irinotecan]] combined with cisplatin.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n[[PARP inhibitor]]s have also shown promise in early trials, particularly in people with ''BRCA'' gene mutations, since the BRCA protein interacts with the PARP pathway. It is also being studied in recurrent ovarian cancer in general, where preliminary studies have shown longer PFS. Specifically, [[olaparib]] has shown greater survival compared to doxorubicin, though this treatment is still being investigated. It is not clear yet which [[biomarker]]s are predictive of responsiveness to PARP inhibitors.<ref name=Jayson/> [[Rucaparib]] is another PARP inhibitor being researched in BRCA-positive and BRCA-negative recurrent advanced ovarian cancer. [[Niraparib]] is a PARP inhibitor being tested in BRCA-positive recurrent ovarian cancer.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n[[Tyrosine kinase inhibitors]] are another investigational drug class that may have applications in ovarian cancer. Angiogenesis inhibitors in the [[receptor tyrosine kinase]] inhibitor group, including [[pazopanib]], [[cediranib]], and [[nintedanib]], have also been shown to increase progression free survival (PFS), but their benefit for overall survival has not been investigated as of 2015.<ref name=\"Jayson\" /> Preliminary research showed that cediranib combined with platins in recurrent ovarian cancer increased the time to second recurrence by 3\u20134 months and increased survival by 3 months.<ref name=\":6\" /> [[MK-1775]] is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is being used in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin in platinum-sensitive cancers with p53 mutations. [[Nintedanib]] is being researched as a potential therapy in combination with cyclophosphamide for people with recurrences.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n[[Histone deacetylase inhibitor]]s (HDACi) are another area of research.\n\n===Hormones and radiation===\nHormone therapies are a topic of current research in ovarian cancer, particularly, the value of certain medications used to treat breast cancer. These include [[tamoxifen]], [[letrozole]], and [[anastrozole]]. Preliminary studies have showed a benefit for tamoxifen in a small number of people with advanced ovarian cancer. Letrozole may help to slow or stop growth of [[estrogen receptor]] positive ovarian cancer. Anastrozole is being investigated in postmenopausal people with estrogen receptor-positive cancer.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nResearch into mitigating side effects of ovarian cancer treatment is also ongoing. [[Radiation fibrosis]], the formation of scar tissue in an area treated with radiation, may be relieved with [[Hyperbaric medicine|hyperbaric oxygen therapy]], but research has not been completed in this area. Treatment of ovarian cancer may also cause people to experience psychiatric difficulties, including [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. Research is ongoing to determine how counseling and psychotherapy can help people who have ovarian cancer during treatment.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n===Inflammation===\n\nThere are some indications that pelvic inflammatory disease may be associated with ovarian cancer, especially in non-western countries. It may be due to the inflammatory process present with pelvic inflammatory disease.<ref name=\"IngerslevHogdall2017\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ingerslev K, Hogdall E, Schnack TH, Skovrider-Ruminski W, Hogdall C, Blaakaer J | title = The potential role of infectious agents and pelvic inflammatory disease in ovarian carcinogenesis | journal = Infectious Agents and Cancer | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 25 | year = 2017 | pmid = 28529540 | pmc = 5437405 | doi = 10.1186/s13027-017-0134-9 }}</ref>\n\n===Clinical trials===\n[[Clinical trial]]s are monitored and funded by US governmental organizations to test treatment options to see if they are safe and effective.

fields of economics and social science was poorly developed in Russian universities. One of the main causes of this state of affairs was the legacy of the [[communism|communist]] system, a system  that had led to the [[Philosophers' ships|exile of many intellectuals]], the absence of which would later end up limiting advancement in several academic fields of research.{{sfn|\u0410\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0431\u0430\u0445|2011|pp=309\u2014313}} The transition from a [[Economy of the Soviet Union|centrally based economy]] to a [[market economy]] started in the USSR in the 1980s.

At that time, in Russia, 33 state universities specialized in sociology and economy. Reforming the existing conservative universities, including the [[Moscow State University]], seemed like an ineffective solution. Thus, the government approved the idea to establish a new university with research priorities in socio-economic sciences.{{sfn|\u0410\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0431\u0430\u0445|2011|p=313\u2014315}}\n\n{{Quote|author=[[Yegor Gaidar]]{{sfn|\u041a\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432|2012|p=29}}|''At the beginning of the 1990s, we understood that the absence of Russian economic school and Russian financial education is a strategic problem for the country <...>.

One of the main causes of this state of affairs was the legacy of the [[communism|communist]] system, a system  that had led to the [[Philosophers' ships|exile of many intellectuals]], the absence of which would later end up limiting advancement in several academic fields of research.{{sfn|\u0410\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0431\u0430\u0445|2011|pp=309\u2014313}} The transition from a [[Economy of the Soviet Union|centrally based economy]] to a [[market economy]] started in the USSR in the 1980s.

At that time, in Russia, 33 state universities specialized in sociology and economy.

In periods of relative [[liberalization]], the influence of people and groups outside the formal party structure has tended to increase, particularly in the economic realm. Under the [[command economy]], every [[state-owned enterprise]] was required to have a party committee. The introduction of the [[market economy]] means that economic institutions now exist in which the party has limited or lots of power.\n\nNevertheless, in all governmental institutions in the PRC, the party committees at all levels maintain a powerful and pivotal role in the administration. Central party control is tightest in central government offices and in urban economic, industrial, and cultural settings; it is considerably looser over the government and party establishments in rural areas, where the majority of [[Mainland China|Mainland Chinese]] people live. The CPC's most important responsibility comes in the selection and promotion of personnel. They also see that party and state policy guidance is followed and that non-party members do not create autonomous organizations that could challenge party rule. Particularly important are the [[leading small group]]s which coordinate activities of different agencies. There is no convention that government committees contain at least one non-party member, party membership is a definite aid in the promotion and in being included in crucial policy-setting meetings.\n\nConstitutionally, the party's highest body is the [[National Congress of the Communist Party of China|Party Congress]], which is supposed to meet at least once every 5 years. Meetings were irregular before the [[Cultural Revolution]] but have been periodic since then. The party elects the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Central Committee]] and the primary organs of power are formally parts of the central committee.\n\nThe primary organs of power in the Communist Party include:\n\n*The [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]], which is the highest-ranking official within the Party and usually the Chinese [[Paramount leader]].\n*The [[Politburo of the Communist Party of China|Politburo]], consisting of 22 full members (including the members of the Politburo Standing Committee);\n*The [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|Politburo Standing Committee]], the most powerful decision-making body in China, which currently{{when?|date=April 2020}} consists of seven members;\n*The  [[Secretariat of the Communist Party of China|Secretariat]], the principal administrative mechanism of the CPC, headed by the General Secretary;\n*The [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]];\n*The [[Central Discipline Inspection Commission]], which is charged with rooting out [[Political corruption|corruption]] and malfeasance among party cadres.\n\n==Government==\n{{Main|Government of China}}{{More citations needed|date=April 2020|section}}\nThe primary organs of state power are the [[National People's Congress]] (NPC), the [[President of the People's Republic of China|President]], and the [[State Council of China|State Council]]. Members of the State Council include the Premier, a variable number of vice premiers (now four), five state councillors (protocol equal of vice premiers but with narrower portfolios), and 29 ministers and heads of State Council commissions. During the 1980s there was an attempt made to separate party and state functions, with the party deciding general policy and the state carrying it out. The attempt was abandoned in the 1990s with the result that the political leadership within the state are also the leaders of the party, thereby creating a single centralized locus of power.\n\nAt the same time, there has been a convention that party and state offices be separated at levels other than the central government, and it is unheard of for a sub-national executive to also be party secretary. The conflict has been often known to develop between the chief executive and the party secretary, and this conflict is widely seen as intentional to prevent either from becoming too dominant. Some special cases are the [[Special Administrative Region]]s of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] where the Communist Party does not function at all as part of the governmental system, and the [[autonomous region]]s where, following Soviet practice, the chief executive is typically a member of the local ethnic group while the party general secretary is non-local and usually [[Han Chinese]].\n\nUnder the [[Constitution of China]], the NPC is the highest organ of state power in China. It meets annually for about 2 weeks to review and approve major new policy directions, laws, the budget, and major personnel changes. Most national legislation in China is adopted by the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress| Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC)]]. Most initiatives are presented to the NPCSC for consideration by the State Council after previous endorsement by the Communist Party's Politburo Standing Committee. Although the NPC generally approves State Council policy and personnel recommendations, the NPC and its standing committee has increasingly asserted its role as the national legislature and has been able to force revisions in some laws.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.merics.org/en/redirect/pdf-china-monitor-nummer-37-en/|title=PDF China Monitor Nummer 37 en - Mercator Institute for China Studies|website=www.merics.org|language=de|access-date=2017-03-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170325202356/https://www.merics.org/en/redirect/pdf-china-monitor-nummer-37-en/|archive-date=25 March 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> For example, the State Council and the Party have been unable to secure passage of a fuel tax to finance the construction of [[freeway]]s.\n\n==Local government==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}\nCurrently,{{when?|date=April 2020}} local government in China is structured in a hierarchy on four different levels. With the ''village'' being the grassroots (usually a hundred or so families), and not considered part of the hierarchy, local government advances through the ''township'', ''county'', ''prefecture'' or ''municipality'', and the ''province'' as the geographical area of jurisdiction increases. Each level in the hierarchy is responsible for overseeing the work carried out by lower levels on the administrative strata. At each level are two important officials. A figure that represents the Communist Party of China, colloquially termed the ''[[CPC party chief|Party chief]]'' or the ''Party Secretary'', acts as the policy maker. This figure is appointed by their superiors. The head of the local [[Central People's Government|People's Government]], is, in theory, elected by the people. Usually called a ''[[governor]]'', ''[[mayor]]'', or ''[[magistrate]]'', depending on the level, this figure acts to carry out the policies and most ceremonial duties. The distinction has evolved into a system where the Party Secretary is always in precedence above the leader of the People's Government.\n\nAfter [[Deng Xiaoping]] took power in 1978 greater autonomy has been given to provinces in terms of economic policy implementation as well as other areas of policy such as education and transportation. As a result, some provincial authorities have evolved tendencies of operating on a ''de facto'' [[Federal republic|federal]] system with Beijing. Prominent examples of greater autonomy are seen in the provinces of [[Guangdong]] and [[Zhejiang]], where local leaders do little to adhere to the strict standards issued by the Central Government, especially economic policy. In addition, conflicts have arisen in the relations of the central Party leaders with the few provincial-level Municipalities, most notably the [[Politics of Shanghai|municipal government of Shanghai]] and the rivalry between former Beijing mayor [[Chen Xitong]] and [[Jiang Zemin]]. The removal of Shanghai Municipality Party Secretary [[Chen Liangyu]] in September 2006 is the latest{{When|date=April 2020}} example.\n\nChina's system of [[autonomous region]]s and autonomous prefectures within provinces are formally intended to provide for greater autonomy by the ethnic group majority that inhabits the region. In practice, however, power rests with the Party secretary. Beijing will often appoint loyal party cadres to oversee the local work as Party secretary, while the local ''Chairman'' of the region's government is regarded as its nominal head. Power rests with the Party secretary. To avoid the solidification of local loyalties during a cadre's term in office, the central government freely and frequently transfers party cadres around different regions of the country, so a high ranking cadre's career might include service as governor or party secretary of several different provinces.\n\n==Administrative divisions==\n{{See also|Administrative divisions of China}}\n{{PRC provinces imagemap}}\n\n== National armed forces ==\n{{main|People's Liberation Army|People's Armed Police|Militia (China)}}{{One source section|date=April 2020}}\nThe Communist Party of China created and leads the People\u2019s Liberation Army. After the PRC was established in 1949, the PLA also became a state military. The state military system inherited and upholds the principle of the Communist Party\u2019s absolute leadership over the people\u2019s armed forces.  The Party and the State jointly established the Central Military Commission that carries out the task of supreme military leadership over the armed forces.\n\nThe 1954 [[PRC Constitution]] provides that the State Chairman (President) directs the armed forces and made the State Chairman the chair of the Defense Commission (the Defense Commission is an advisory body, it does not lead the armed forces).  On September 28, 1954, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party re-established the Central Military Commission as the leader of the PLA and the people\u2019s armed forces. From that time onwards, the system of joint Party and state military leadership was established. The Central Committee of the Communist Party leads in all military affairs. The State Chairman directs the state military forces and the development of the military forces managed by the State Council.<ref name=Xingzu>Pu Xingzu, Chapter 11, The State Military System in \"The Political System of the People's Republic of China\",(Zhonghua Renmin Gongheguo Zhengzhi Zhidu) Chief Editor Pu Xingzu, Shanghai, 2005,  Shanghai People\u2019s Publishing House. {{ISBN|7-208-05566-1}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2004, the fifth [[National People\u2019s Congress]] revised the State Constitution to provide that the State [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]] leads all the armed forces of the state.  The chair of the State CMC is chosen and removed by the full NPC while the other members are chosen by the NPC Standing Committee.  However, the CMC of the [[Central Committee]] of the [[Communist Party of China]] remained the Party organization that directly leads the military and all the other armed forces. In actual practice, the Party CMC, after consultation with the democratic parties, proposes the names of the State CMC members of the NPC so that these people after going through the legal processes can be elected by the NPC to the State Central Military Commission. That is to say, that the CMC of the Central Committee and the CMC of the State are one group and one organization. However, looking at it organizationally, these two CMCs are subordinate to two different systems \u2013 the Party system and the State system. Therefore, the armed forces are under the absolute leadership of the Communist Party and are also the armed forces of the state.  This is a unique{{Peacock inline|date=April 2020}} Chinese system that ensures the joint leadership of the Communist Party and the state over the armed forces.<ref name=Xingzu/>\n\n{{See also|List of wars involving the People's Republic of China}}\n\n==State leaders==\n{{see also|Paramount leader|List of national leaders of the People's Republic of China|Political position ranking of PRC|Politburo of the Communist Party of China|Generations of Chinese leadership}}\n\n===Politburo Standing Committee===\n{{CPC Politburo Standing Committee}}\n\n===Full Politburo members===\n{{CPC Politburo}}\n\n==Elections==\n{{main|Elections in the People's Republic of China}}\nNo substantial legal political opposition groups exist, and the country is mainly run by the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC), but there are other political parties in the PRC, called \"democratic parties\", which participate in the [[People's Political Consultative Conference]] but mostly serve to endorse CPC policies.

These parties all formally accept the leadership of the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) and their activities are directed by the [[United Front Work Department]] of the CPC. Their original function was to create the impression that the PRC was being ruled by a diverse national front, not a one-party dictatorship. The major role of these parties is to attract and subsequently muzzle niches in society that have political tendencies, such as academia. Although these parties are tightly controlled and do not challenge the Communist Party, members of the parties often individually are found in policy-making national institutions, and there is a convention that state institutions generally have at least one sinecure from a minor political party.\n\nThe minor parties include the [[Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Guomindang]], founded in 1948 by dissident members of the mainstream [[Kuomintang]] then under control of Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]]; [[China Democratic League]], created in 1941 by intellectuals in education and the arts; [[China Democratic National Construction Association]], formed in 1945 by educators and national [[capitalism|capitalist]]s (industrialists and business people); [[China Association for Promoting Democracy]], started in 1945 by intellectuals in cultural, education (primary and secondary schools), and publishing circles; [[Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party]], originated in 1930 by intellectuals in medicine, the arts, and education; [[China Party for Public Interest]] (China Zhi Gong Dang), founded in 1925 to attract the support of overseas Chinese; [[Jiusan Society]], founded in 1945 by a group of college professors and scientists to commemorate the victory of the \"[[World War II|international war against fascism]]\" on September 3; and [[Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League]], created in 1947 by \"patriotic supporters of democracy who originated in Taiwan and now reside on the mainland.\"\n\nCoordination between the eight registered minor parties and the Communist Party of China is done through the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]] which meets annually in Beijing in March at about the same time that the National People's Congress meets. In addition, there are a few minor parties which either lack official recognition or are actively suppressed by the government, such as the [[Maoist Communist Party of China]], [[China Democracy Party]] and [[China New Democracy Party]], which have their headquarters outside of the [[Mainland China]].<ref>https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ch.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013030611/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ch.html |date=13 October 2016 }} CIA - The World Factbook -- China, retrieved December 12, 2007.</ref>\n\n==Legal system==\n{{main|Law of the People's Republic of China}}{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}\nThe Chinese legal code is a complex amalgam of custom and statute, largely focused on criminal law, though a rudimentary civil code has been in effect since January 1, 1987, and new legal codes have been in effect since January 1, 1980. Continuing efforts are being made to improve civil, administrative, criminal, and commercial law.\n\nAlthough the current{{when?|date=April 2020}} law of China cannot be categorised by arbitrary rule, it is over-simplifying to describe it as a system of rule of law. While personal freedom and right to private property is nominally guaranteed by law, officials maintain the right to trespass citizens before proving or suspecting them breaking the law through the use of [[Administrative law|Droit administration.]] In other words, the concept of [[Habeas corpus]] does not apply in China. Also, Party members are subjected to different sets of law, namely the [[Constitution of the Communist Party of China]], which authorises itself to use state apparatus to regulate behaviours of party members, sometimes overriding [[Law of the land]]. One of the most distinctive characteristics of Chinese law is the lack of a mechanism to verify the constitutionality of statute laws. This in effect allows the enactment of any administrative laws as long as circumstances justify.\n\nThe government's efforts to promote rule by law (not the same as [[rule of law]]) are significant and ongoing. After the [[Cultural Revolution]], the PRC's leaders aimed to develop a legal system to restrain abuses of official authority and revolutionary excesses. In 1982, the National People's Congress adopted a new state constitution that emphasized the concept of rule by law by which party and state organizations are all subject to the law. (The importance of the rule by law was further elevated by a 1999 Constitutional amendment.) Many commentators{{Who|date=December 2011}} have pointed out that the emphasis on rule by law increases rather than decreases the power of the [[Communist Party of China]] because the party, in its position of power, is in a better position to change the law to suit its own needs.\n\nSince 1979, when the drive to establish a functioning legal system began, more than 301 laws and regulations, most of them in the economic area, have been promulgated. (After [[China and the World Trade Organization|China's entry into the WTO]], many new economically related laws have been put in place, while others have been amended.) The use of mediation committees - informed groups of citizens who resolve about 90% of the PRC's civil disputes and some minor criminal cases at no cost to the parties - is one innovative device. There are more than 800,000 such committees in both rural and urban areas.\n\nLegal reform became a government priority in the 1990s. Legislation designed to modernize and professionalize the nation's lawyers, judges, and prisons was enacted. The 1994 Administrative Procedure Law allows citizens to sue officials for abuse of authority or malfeasance. In addition, the criminal law and the criminal procedures laws were amended to introduce significant reforms. The criminal law amendments abolished the crime of \"counter-revolutionary\" activity (and references to \"counter-revolutionaries\" disappeared with the passing of the 1999 Constitutional amendment), while criminal procedures reforms encouraged the establishment of a more transparent, adversarial trial process. The PRC Constitution and laws provide for fundamental human rights, including due process, although those laws also provide for limitations of those rights.\n\nAlthough the human rights situation in [[mainland China]] has improved markedly since the 1960s (the 2004 Constitutional amendments specifically stressed that the State protects human rights), the government remains determined to prevent any organized opposition to its rule. [[Amnesty International]] estimates that the PRC holds several thousand political prisoners. Although illegal, there have been reports of [[torture]] by civil authorities.\n\n==Nationality and ethnicity==\n{{See also|Nationality Law of the People's Republic of China|Regional ethnic autonomy system of China}}{{One source section|date=April 2020}}\nNationality is granted at birth to children with at least one Chinese-national parent, with some exceptions. In general, [[naturalization]] or the obtainment of the People's Republic of China nationality is difficult. The Nationality Law prescribes only three conditions for the obtainment of PRC nationality (marriage to a PRC national is one, permanent residence is another). If a PRC citizen voluntarily obtains a foreign nationality, he or she loses Chinese nationality automatically (yet this regulation does not apply to party members or government officials{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}). If the citizen then wishes to resume PRC nationality, foreign nationality is no longer recognized. \n\nThe PRC is officially a multi-ethnic state providing ethnic autonomy in the form of [[autonomous entities of China|autonomous administrative entities]].<ref>Section 6 of Chapter 3 (Articles 112-122) of the [[Constitution of China]], further specified under the [[Law of the People's Republic of China on Ethnical Regional Autonomy System]]</ref> By law, ethnic minorities receive advantages in areas such as population control, school admissions, government employment, and military recruitment. The PRC recognises 56 nationalities in China and simultaneously categorises them as one hegemonic [[Chinese nation]]. However, [[Separatism|separatist]] sentiment has occasionally flared in [[Tibet]] and [[Xinjiang]]. As such, independence groups and foreign human rights groups are critical of the PRC's policies in ethnic areas and have bemoaned the presence of [[Han Chinese]] (the main ethnic group of China) in Xinjiang and Tibet.\n\n==Foreign relations==\n[[Image:Bushhujintao.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Hu Jintao]] and US president [[George W.

In 1971, the PRC replaced the [[Republic of China]], commonly known as \"Taiwan\" since the 1970s, as the sole representative of China in the [[United Nations]] and as one of the five permanent members of the [[United Nations Security Council]].<ref>Eddy Chang (Aug 22, 2004).

The government actively opposes foreign government meetings with the [[14th Dalai Lama]] in a political capacity, as the spokesperson of a separatist movement in Tibet.\n\nThe PRC has been playing a leading role in calling for [[free trade area]]s and security pacts amongst its Asia-Pacific neighbours. In 2004, the PRC proposed an entirely new [[East Asia Summit]] (EAS) framework as a forum for regional security issues that pointedly excluded the United States.<ref>Dillon, Dana and John Tkacik Jr, [http://www.policyreview.org/134/dillon.html \"China\u2019s Quest for Asia\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210135228/http://www.policyreview.org/134/dillon.html |date=10 February 2006 }}, ''Policy Review'', December 2005 and January 2006, Issue No. 134.

China's foreign relations with many Western nations suffered for a time following the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]]. A much troubled foreign relationship is that between [[Sino-Japanese relations|China and Japan]], which has been strained at times by Japan's refusal to acknowledge its wartime past to the satisfaction of the PRC, such as [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|revisionistic]] comments made by prominent Japanese officials, and insufficient details given to the [[Nanking Massacre|Nanjing Massacre]] and other [[Japanese war crimes|atrocities]] committed during [[World War II]] in [[Japanese history textbook controversies|Japanese history textbooks]]. Another point of conflict between the two countries is the frequent visits by Japanese government officials to the [[Yasukuni Shrine]], which honours not only Japanese World War II dead but also many convicted World War II war criminals, including 14 Class A convictions.\n\n==International disputes==\nThe PRC is in a number of [[Foreign relations of China#International territorial disputes|international territorial disputes]], several of which involved the Sino-Russian border. Although the great majority of them are now resolved,{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} China's territorial disputes have led to several localized wars in the last 50 years, including the [[Sino-Indian War]] in 1962, the [[Sino-Soviet border conflict]] in 1969 and the [[Sino-Vietnam War]] in 1979. In 2001, China and Russia signed the [[2001 Sino-Russian Treaty of Friendship|Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation]],<ref>[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2006-03/21/content_548330.htm Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060826175727/http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2006-03/21/content_548330.htm |date=26 August 2006 }} (March 21, 2006).

In periods of relative [[liberalization]], the influence of people and groups outside the formal party structure has tended to increase, particularly in the economic realm. Under the [[command economy]], every [[state-owned enterprise]] was required to have a party committee. The introduction of the [[market economy]] means that economic institutions now exist in which the party has limited or lots of power.\n\nNevertheless, in all governmental institutions in the PRC, the party committees at all levels maintain a powerful and pivotal role in the administration. Central party control is tightest in central government offices and in urban economic, industrial, and cultural settings; it is considerably looser over the government and party establishments in rural areas, where the majority of [[Mainland China|Mainland Chinese]] people live. The CPC's most important responsibility comes in the selection and promotion of personnel. They also see that party and state policy guidance is followed and that non-party members do not create autonomous organizations that could challenge party rule. Particularly important are the [[leading small group]]s which coordinate activities of different agencies. There is no convention that government committees contain at least one non-party member, party membership is a definite aid in the promotion and in being included in crucial policy-setting meetings.\n\nConstitutionally, the party's highest body is the [[National Congress of the Communist Party of China|Party Congress]], which is supposed to meet at least once every 5 years. Meetings were irregular before the [[Cultural Revolution]] but have been periodic since then. The party elects the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Central Committee]] and the primary organs of power are formally parts of the central committee.\n\nThe primary organs of power in the Communist Party include:\n\n*The [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]], which is the highest-ranking official within the Party and usually the Chinese [[Paramount leader]].\n*The [[Politburo of the Communist Party of China|Politburo]], consisting of 22 full members (including the members of the Politburo Standing Committee);\n*The [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|Politburo Standing Committee]], the most powerful decision-making body in China, which currently{{when?|date=April 2020}} consists of seven members;\n*The  [[Secretariat of the Communist Party of China|Secretariat]], the principal administrative mechanism of the CPC, headed by the General Secretary;\n*The [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]];\n*The [[Central Discipline Inspection Commission]], which is charged with rooting out [[Political corruption|corruption]] and malfeasance among party cadres.\n\n==Government==\n{{Main|Government of China}}{{More citations needed|date=April 2020|section}}\nThe primary organs of state power are the [[National People's Congress]] (NPC), the [[President of the People's Republic of China|President]], and the [[State Council of China|State Council]]. Members of the State Council include the Premier, a variable number of vice premiers (now four), five state councillors (protocol equal of vice premiers but with narrower portfolios), and 29 ministers and heads of State Council commissions. During the 1980s there was an attempt made to separate party and state functions, with the party deciding general policy and the state carrying it out. The attempt was abandoned in the 1990s with the result that the political leadership within the state are also the leaders of the party, thereby creating a single centralized locus of power.\n\nAt the same time, there has been a convention that party and state offices be separated at levels other than the central government, and it is unheard of for a sub-national executive to also be party secretary. The conflict has been often known to develop between the chief executive and the party secretary, and this conflict is widely seen as intentional to prevent either from becoming too dominant. Some special cases are the [[Special Administrative Region]]s of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] where the Communist Party does not function at all as part of the governmental system, and the [[autonomous region]]s where, following Soviet practice, the chief executive is typically a member of the local ethnic group while the party general secretary is non-local and usually [[Han Chinese]].\n\nUnder the [[Constitution of China]], the NPC is the highest organ of state power in China. It meets annually for about 2 weeks to review and approve major new policy directions, laws, the budget, and major personnel changes. Most national legislation in China is adopted by the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress| Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC)]]. Most initiatives are presented to the NPCSC for consideration by the State Council after previous endorsement by the Communist Party's Politburo Standing Committee. Although the NPC generally approves State Council policy and personnel recommendations, the NPC and its standing committee has increasingly asserted its role as the national legislature and has been able to force revisions in some laws.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.merics.org/en/redirect/pdf-china-monitor-nummer-37-en/|title=PDF China Monitor Nummer 37 en - Mercator Institute for China Studies|website=www.merics.org|language=de|access-date=2017-03-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170325202356/https://www.merics.org/en/redirect/pdf-china-monitor-nummer-37-en/|archive-date=25 March 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> For example, the State Council and the Party have been unable to secure passage of a fuel tax to finance the construction of [[freeway]]s.\n\n==Local government==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}\nCurrently,{{when?|date=April 2020}} local government in China is structured in a hierarchy on four different levels. With the ''village'' being the grassroots (usually a hundred or so families), and not considered part of the hierarchy, local government advances through the ''township'', ''county'', ''prefecture'' or ''municipality'', and the ''province'' as the geographical area of jurisdiction increases. Each level in the hierarchy is responsible for overseeing the work carried out by lower levels on the administrative strata. At each level are two important officials. A figure that represents the Communist Party of China, colloquially termed the ''[[CPC party chief|Party chief]]'' or the ''Party Secretary'', acts as the policy maker. This figure is appointed by their superiors. The head of the local [[Central People's Government|People's Government]], is, in theory, elected by the people. Usually called a ''[[governor]]'', ''[[mayor]]'', or ''[[magistrate]]'', depending on the level, this figure acts to carry out the policies and most ceremonial duties. The distinction has evolved into a system where the Party Secretary is always in precedence above the leader of the People's Government.\n\nAfter [[Deng Xiaoping]] took power in 1978 greater autonomy has been given to provinces in terms of economic policy implementation as well as other areas of policy such as education and transportation. As a result, some provincial authorities have evolved tendencies of operating on a ''de facto'' [[Federal republic|federal]] system with Beijing. Prominent examples of greater autonomy are seen in the provinces of [[Guangdong]] and [[Zhejiang]], where local leaders do little to adhere to the strict standards issued by the Central Government, especially economic policy. In addition, conflicts have arisen in the relations of the central Party leaders with the few provincial-level Municipalities, most notably the [[Politics of Shanghai|municipal government of Shanghai]] and the rivalry between former Beijing mayor [[Chen Xitong]] and [[Jiang Zemin]]. The removal of Shanghai Municipality Party Secretary [[Chen Liangyu]] in September 2006 is the latest{{When|date=April 2020}} example.\n\nChina's system of [[autonomous region]]s and autonomous prefectures within provinces are formally intended to provide for greater autonomy by the ethnic group majority that inhabits the region. In practice, however, power rests with the Party secretary. Beijing will often appoint loyal party cadres to oversee the local work as Party secretary, while the local ''Chairman'' of the region's government is regarded as its nominal head. Power rests with the Party secretary. To avoid the solidification of local loyalties during a cadre's term in office, the central government freely and frequently transfers party cadres around different regions of the country, so a high ranking cadre's career might include service as governor or party secretary of several different provinces.\n\n==Administrative divisions==\n{{See also|Administrative divisions of China}}\n{{PRC provinces imagemap}}\n\n== National armed forces ==\n{{main|People's Liberation Army|People's Armed Police|Militia (China)}}{{One source section|date=April 2020}}\nThe Communist Party of China created and leads the People\u2019s Liberation Army. After the PRC was established in 1949, the PLA also became a state military. The state military system inherited and upholds the principle of the Communist Party\u2019s absolute leadership over the people\u2019s armed forces.  The Party and the State jointly established the Central Military Commission that carries out the task of supreme military leadership over the armed forces.\n\nThe 1954 [[PRC Constitution]] provides that the State Chairman (President) directs the armed forces and made the State Chairman the chair of the Defense Commission (the Defense Commission is an advisory body, it does not lead the armed forces).  On September 28, 1954, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party re-established the Central Military Commission as the leader of the PLA and the people\u2019s armed forces. From that time onwards, the system of joint Party and state military leadership was established. The Central Committee of the Communist Party leads in all military affairs. The State Chairman directs the state military forces and the development of the military forces managed by the State Council.<ref name=Xingzu>Pu Xingzu, Chapter 11, The State Military System in \"The Political System of the People's Republic of China\",(Zhonghua Renmin Gongheguo Zhengzhi Zhidu) Chief Editor Pu Xingzu, Shanghai, 2005,  Shanghai People\u2019s Publishing House. {{ISBN|7-208-05566-1}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2004, the fifth [[National People\u2019s Congress]] revised the State Constitution to provide that the State [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]] leads all the armed forces of the state.  The chair of the State CMC is chosen and removed by the full NPC while the other members are chosen by the NPC Standing Committee.  However, the CMC of the [[Central Committee]] of the [[Communist Party of China]] remained the Party organization that directly leads the military and all the other armed forces. In actual practice, the Party CMC, after consultation with the democratic parties, proposes the names of the State CMC members of the NPC so that these people after going through the legal processes can be elected by the NPC to the State Central Military Commission. That is to say, that the CMC of the Central Committee and the CMC of the State are one group and one organization. However, looking at it organizationally, these two CMCs are subordinate to two different systems \u2013 the Party system and the State system. Therefore, the armed forces are under the absolute leadership of the Communist Party and are also the armed forces of the state.  This is a unique{{Peacock inline|date=April 2020}} Chinese system that ensures the joint leadership of the Communist Party and the state over the armed forces.<ref name=Xingzu/>\n\n{{See also|List of wars involving the People's Republic of China}}\n\n==State leaders==\n{{see also|Paramount leader|List of national leaders of the People's Republic of China|Political position ranking of PRC|Politburo of the Communist Party of China|Generations of Chinese leadership}}\n\n===Politburo Standing Committee===\n{{CPC Politburo Standing Committee}}\n\n===Full Politburo members===\n{{CPC Politburo}}\n\n==Elections==\n{{main|Elections in the People's Republic of China}}\nNo substantial legal political opposition groups exist, and the country is mainly run by the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC), but there are other political parties in the PRC, called \"democratic parties\", which participate in the [[People's Political Consultative Conference]] but mostly serve to endorse CPC policies.

These parties all formally accept the leadership of the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) and their activities are directed by the [[United Front Work Department]] of the CPC. Their original function was to create the impression that the PRC was being ruled by a diverse national front, not a one-party dictatorship. The major role of these parties is to attract and subsequently muzzle niches in society that have political tendencies, such as academia. Although these parties are tightly controlled and do not challenge the Communist Party, members of the parties often individually are found in policy-making national institutions, and there is a convention that state institutions generally have at least one sinecure from a minor political party.\n\nThe minor parties include the [[Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Guomindang]], founded in 1948 by dissident members of the mainstream [[Kuomintang]] then under control of Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]]; [[China Democratic League]], created in 1941 by intellectuals in education and the arts; [[China Democratic National Construction Association]], formed in 1945 by educators and national [[capitalism|capitalist]]s (industrialists and business people); [[China Association for Promoting Democracy]], started in 1945 by intellectuals in cultural, education (primary and secondary schools), and publishing circles; [[Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party]], originated in 1930 by intellectuals in medicine, the arts, and education; [[China Party for Public Interest]] (China Zhi Gong Dang), founded in 1925 to attract the support of overseas Chinese; [[Jiusan Society]], founded in 1945 by a group of college professors and scientists to commemorate the victory of the \"[[World War II|international war against fascism]]\" on September 3; and [[Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League]], created in 1947 by \"patriotic supporters of democracy who originated in Taiwan and now reside on the mainland.\"\n\nCoordination between the eight registered minor parties and the Communist Party of China is done through the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]] which meets annually in Beijing in March at about the same time that the National People's Congress meets. In addition, there are a few minor parties which either lack official recognition or are actively suppressed by the government, such as the [[Maoist Communist Party of China]], [[China Democracy Party]] and [[China New Democracy Party]], which have their headquarters outside of the [[Mainland China]].<ref>https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ch.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013030611/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ch.html |date=13 October 2016 }} CIA - The World Factbook -- China, retrieved December 12, 2007.</ref>\n\n==Legal system==\n{{main|Law of the People's Republic of China}}{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}\nThe Chinese legal code is a complex amalgam of custom and statute, largely focused on criminal law, though a rudimentary civil code has been in effect since January 1, 1987, and new legal codes have been in effect since January 1, 1980. Continuing efforts are being made to improve civil, administrative, criminal, and commercial law.\n\nAlthough the current{{when?|date=April 2020}} law of China cannot be categorised by arbitrary rule, it is over-simplifying to describe it as a system of rule of law. While personal freedom and right to private property is nominally guaranteed by law, officials maintain the right to trespass citizens before proving or suspecting them breaking the law through the use of [[Administrative law|Droit administration.]] In other words, the concept of [[Habeas corpus]] does not apply in China. Also, Party members are subjected to different sets of law, namely the [[Constitution of the Communist Party of China]], which authorises itself to use state apparatus to regulate behaviours of party members, sometimes overriding [[Law of the land]]. One of the most distinctive characteristics of Chinese law is the lack of a mechanism to verify the constitutionality of statute laws. This in effect allows the enactment of any administrative laws as long as circumstances justify.\n\nThe government's efforts to promote rule by law (not the same as [[rule of law]]) are significant and ongoing. After the [[Cultural Revolution]], the PRC's leaders aimed to develop a legal system to restrain abuses of official authority and revolutionary excesses. In 1982, the National People's Congress adopted a new state constitution that emphasized the concept of rule by law by which party and state organizations are all subject to the law. (The importance of the rule by law was further elevated by a 1999 Constitutional amendment.) Many commentators{{Who|date=December 2011}} have pointed out that the emphasis on rule by law increases rather than decreases the power of the [[Communist Party of China]] because the party, in its position of power, is in a better position to change the law to suit its own needs.\n\nSince 1979, when the drive to establish a functioning legal system began, more than 301 laws and regulations, most of them in the economic area, have been promulgated. (After [[China and the World Trade Organization|China's entry into the WTO]], many new economically related laws have been put in place, while others have been amended.) The use of mediation committees - informed groups of citizens who resolve about 90% of the PRC's civil disputes and some minor criminal cases at no cost to the parties - is one innovative device. There are more than 800,000 such committees in both rural and urban areas.\n\nLegal reform became a government priority in the 1990s. Legislation designed to modernize and professionalize the nation's lawyers, judges, and prisons was enacted. The 1994 Administrative Procedure Law allows citizens to sue officials for abuse of authority or malfeasance. In addition, the criminal law and the criminal procedures laws were amended to introduce significant reforms. The criminal law amendments abolished the crime of \"counter-revolutionary\" activity (and references to \"counter-revolutionaries\" disappeared with the passing of the 1999 Constitutional amendment), while criminal procedures reforms encouraged the establishment of a more transparent, adversarial trial process. The PRC Constitution and laws provide for fundamental human rights, including due process, although those laws also provide for limitations of those rights.\n\nAlthough the human rights situation in [[mainland China]] has improved markedly since the 1960s (the 2004 Constitutional amendments specifically stressed that the State protects human rights), the government remains determined to prevent any organized opposition to its rule. [[Amnesty International]] estimates that the PRC holds several thousand political prisoners. Although illegal, there have been reports of [[torture]] by civil authorities.\n\n==Nationality and ethnicity==\n{{See also|Nationality Law of the People's Republic of China|Regional ethnic autonomy system of China}}{{One source section|date=April 2020}}\nNationality is granted at birth to children with at least one Chinese-national parent, with some exceptions. In general, [[naturalization]] or the obtainment of the People's Republic of China nationality is difficult. The Nationality Law prescribes only three conditions for the obtainment of PRC nationality (marriage to a PRC national is one, permanent residence is another). If a PRC citizen voluntarily obtains a foreign nationality, he or she loses Chinese nationality automatically (yet this regulation does not apply to party members or government officials{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}). If the citizen then wishes to resume PRC nationality, foreign nationality is no longer recognized. \n\nThe PRC is officially a multi-ethnic state providing ethnic autonomy in the form of [[autonomous entities of China|autonomous administrative entities]].<ref>Section 6 of Chapter 3 (Articles 112-122) of the [[Constitution of China]], further specified under the [[Law of the People's Republic of China on Ethnical Regional Autonomy System]]</ref> By law, ethnic minorities receive advantages in areas such as population control, school admissions, government employment, and military recruitment. The PRC recognises 56 nationalities in China and simultaneously categorises them as one hegemonic [[Chinese nation]]. However, [[Separatism|separatist]] sentiment has occasionally flared in [[Tibet]] and [[Xinjiang]]. As such, independence groups and foreign human rights groups are critical of the PRC's policies in ethnic areas and have bemoaned the presence of [[Han Chinese]] (the main ethnic group of China) in Xinjiang and Tibet.\n\n==Foreign relations==\n[[Image:Bushhujintao.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Hu Jintao]] and US president [[George W.

The government actively opposes foreign government meetings with the [[14th Dalai Lama]] in a political capacity, as the spokesperson of a separatist movement in Tibet.\n\nThe PRC has been playing a leading role in calling for [[free trade area]]s and security pacts amongst its Asia-Pacific neighbours. In 2004, the PRC proposed an entirely new [[East Asia Summit]] (EAS) framework as a forum for regional security issues that pointedly excluded the United States.<ref>Dillon, Dana and John Tkacik Jr, [http://www.policyreview.org/134/dillon.html \"China\u2019s Quest for Asia\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210135228/http://www.policyreview.org/134/dillon.html |date=10 February 2006 }}, ''Policy Review'', December 2005 and January 2006, Issue No. 134.

China's foreign relations with many Western nations suffered for a time following the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]]. A much troubled foreign relationship is that between [[Sino-Japanese relations|China and Japan]], which has been strained at times by Japan's refusal to acknowledge its wartime past to the satisfaction of the PRC, such as [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|revisionistic]] comments made by prominent Japanese officials, and insufficient details given to the [[Nanking Massacre|Nanjing Massacre]] and other [[Japanese war crimes|atrocities]] committed during [[World War II]] in [[Japanese history textbook controversies|Japanese history textbooks]]. Another point of conflict between the two countries is the frequent visits by Japanese government officials to the [[Yasukuni Shrine]], which honours not only Japanese World War II dead but also many convicted World War II war criminals, including 14 Class A convictions.\n\n==International disputes==\nThe PRC is in a number of [[Foreign relations of China#International territorial disputes|international territorial disputes]], several of which involved the Sino-Russian border. Although the great majority of them are now resolved,{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} China's territorial disputes have led to several localized wars in the last 50 years, including the [[Sino-Indian War]] in 1962, the [[Sino-Soviet border conflict]] in 1969 and the [[Sino-Vietnam War]] in 1979.

It is in the [[English Channel]], between 2 and 5 miles off the coast of [[Hampshire]], separated by the [[Solent]]. The island has resorts that have been holiday destinations since [[Victorian era|Victorian times]], and is known for its mild climate, coastal scenery, and verdant landscape of fields, [[downland]] and [[chines]].  The island is designated a [[UNESCO Biosphere Reserve]].\n\nThe island has been home to the poets [[Algernon Charles Swinburne|Swinburne]] and [[Alfred Lord Tennyson|Tennyson]] and to [[Queen Victoria]], who built her much-loved summer residence and final home [[Osborne House]] at [[East Cowes]].  It has a maritime and industrial tradition including [[Isle of Wight#Neolithic Isle of Wight|boat-building]], sail-making, the manufacture of [[flying boat]]s, the [[hovercraft]], and Britain's [[British space programme|space rockets]]. The island hosts annual music festivals including the [[Isle of Wight Festival]], which in 1970 was the largest rock music event ever held.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.redfunnel.co.uk/island-guide/isle-of-wight-music-festivals-and-concerts/isle-of-wight-festival/iow-festival-history |title=Isle of Wight Festival history |publisher=Redfunnel.co.uk|accessdate=25 September 2010}}</ref> It has well-conserved wildlife and some of the richest cliffs and quarries for [[dinosaur]] [[fossil]]s in Europe.\n\nThe isle was owned by a Norman family until 1293 and was earlier a [[Wihtwara|kingdom in its own right]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/learn/story-of-england/medieval-part-1/isabella-de-fortibus/|title=Isabella de Fortibus, \"Queen of the Wight\" - English Heritage}}</ref> In common with the [[Crown dependencies]], the British Crown was then represented on the island by the [[Governor of the Isle of Wight]]{{refn|As well as the former Princess Beatrice during World War II, most otherwise notable was [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Mountbatten]] in 1969\u20131974, after which he became [[Lord Lieutenant]] until his assassination in 1979.|group= n}} until 1995.

The river flowed eastward from Dorset, following the course of the modern Solent strait, before travelling south and southwest towards the major Channel River system. \n\nThe earliest evidence of archaic human presence on what is now the Isle of Wight is found at [[Priory Bay]]. Here more than 300 [[Acheulean|acheulean handaxes]] have been recovered from the beach and cliff slopes, originating from a sequence of Pleistocene gravels dating approximately to [[Marine Isotope Stage 11|MIS 11]] (424,000-374,000 years ago).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wenban-Smith|first=Francis|title=The Pleistocene sequence at Priory Bay, Isle of Wight (SZ 635 900)|url=https://www.academia.edu/1794967/The_Pleistocene_sequence_at_Priory_Bay_Isle_of_Wight_SZ_635_900_|language=en}}</ref>\n\nA Mousterian flint assemblage, consisting of 50 handaxes and debitage has been recovered from Great Pan Farm near Newport. Possibly dating to MIS 7 (c.240,000 years ago), these tools are associated with Neanderthal occupation. \n\n=== Mesolithic Isle of Wight ===\nA submerged escarpment 11m below sea level off [[Bouldnor Cliff]] on the island's northwest coastline is home to an internationally significant mesolithic archaeological site. The site has yielded evidence of seasonal occupation by mesolithic hunter-gatherers dating to c.8000 years BP.  Finds include flint tools, burnt flint, worked timbers, wooden platforms and pits. The worked wood shows evidence of the splitting of large planks from oak trunks, interpreted as being intended for use as dug-out canoes. DNA analysis of sediments at the site yielded wheat DNA, not found in Britain until the [[Neolithic]] 2000 years after the occupation at Bouldnor Cliff. It has been suggested this is evidence of wide-reaching trade in mesolithic Europe, however the contemporaneity of the wheat with the Mesolithic occupation has been contested. When hunter-gatherers used the site it was located on a river bank surrounded by wetland and woodland.<ref>https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/8000-year-old-boat-building-platform-found-coast-britain-180972989/</ref> As sea levels rose throughout the [[Holocene]] the river valley slowly flooded, submerging the site.\n\nEvidence of mesolithic occupation on the island is generally found along the river valleys, particularly along the north of the Island, and in the former catchment of the western Yar. Further key sites are found at Newtown Creek, Werrar and Wootton-Quarr. \n\n=== Neolithic Isle of Wight ===\nNeolithic occupation on the Isle of Wight is primarily attested to by flint tools and monuments. Unlike the previous mesolithic hunter-gatherer population Neolithic communities on the Isle of Wight were based on farming and linked to a wide-scale migration of Neolithic populations from France and northwest Europe to Britain c.6000 years ago. \n\nThe Isle of Wight's most visible Neolithic site is the Longstone at [[Mottistone]], the remains of a [[Long barrow|long-barrow]] originally constructed with two standing stones at the entrance. Only one stone remains standing today. A Neolithic mortuary enclosure has been identified on [[Tennyson Down]] near [[Freshwater, Isle of Wight|Freshwater]]. \n\n===Bronze and Iron Age Isle of Wight===\n[[Bronze Age Britain]] had large reserves of tin in the areas of [[Cornwall]] and [[Devon]] and [[tin]] is necessary to [[smelting|smelt]] [[bronze]]. At that time the sea level was much lower and carts of tin were brought across the [[Solent]] at low tide<ref name=\"Adams 1877\">{{cite book|last1=Adams|first1=William Henry Davenport|title=Nelsons' hand-book to the Isle of Wight|date=1877|publisher=Oxford University|url=https://books.google.com/?id=hQoHAAAAQAAJ&dq=Cotentin+Peninsula+trade+Isle+of+Wight|accessdate=16 March 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Hawkes 1984\"/> for export, possibly on the [[Ferriby Boats]].

From the Anglo-Saxon period Latin ''Vecta'', Old English ''Wiht'' and Old Welsh forms ''Gueid'' and ''Guith'' are recorded. In [[Domesday Book]] it is ''Wit''; the modern Welsh name is ''Ynys Wyth'' (''ynys'' = island). These are all variant forms of the same name, possibly Celtic in origin. It may mean \"place of the division\", because the island divides the two arms of the Solent.<ref>[[Eilert Ekwall]], ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-Names'', 4th ed. (Oxford University Press, 1960) p. 518</ref><ref>[[A. L. F.

Slightly more than half, mainly in the west, is designated as the [[Isle of Wight AONB|Isle of Wight Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]].  The island has {{convert|258|km2|abbr=on|order=flip}} of farmland, {{convert|52|km2|abbr=on|order=flip}} of developed areas, and {{convert|57|mi}} of coastline. Its landscapes are diverse, leading to its oft-quoted description as \"England in miniature\".  In June 2019 the whole island was designated a [[Man and the Biosphere Programme|UNESCO Biosphere Reserve]], recognising the sustainable relationships between its residents and the local environment.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hampshire-48692295|date=19 June 2019|accessdate=20 June 2019|website=www.bbc.co.uk|title=Isle of Wight joins Unesco's network of biosphere sites}}</ref>\n\nWest Wight is predominantly rural, with dramatic coastlines dominated by the [[chalk]] [[downland]] ridge, running across the whole island and ending in [[the Needles]] stacks.  The southwestern quarter is commonly referred to as the [[Back of the Wight]], and has a unique character. The highest point on the island is [[St Boniface Down]] in the south east, which at {{convert|241|m|ft|order=flip}} is a [[Marilyn (hill)|marilyn]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://peakbagger.com/peak.aspx?pid=9547|title=St Boniface Down, England |author=Staff writer(s); no by-line| date=1987\u20132012| publisher=Peakbagger.com |accessdate=11 December 2012}}</ref> The most notable habitats on the rest of the island are probably the soft cliffs and sea ledges, which are scenic features, important for wildlife, and internationally protected.\n\nThe island has three principal rivers. The [[River Medina]] flows north into the [[Solent]], the [[Eastern Yar (river), Isle of Wight|Eastern Yar]] flows roughly northeast to [[Bembridge]] Harbour, and the [[Western Yar (river), Isle of Wight|Western Yar]] flows the short distance from [[Freshwater Bay, Isle of Wight|Freshwater Bay]] to a relatively large estuary at [[Yarmouth, Isle of Wight|Yarmouth]].  Without human intervention the sea might well have split the island into three: at the west end where a bank of pebbles separates Freshwater Bay from the [[marsh]]y backwaters of the Western Yar east of Freshwater, and at the east end where a thin strip of land separates [[Sandown Bay]] from the marshy Eastern Yar basin.\n\nThe [[Undercliff]] between St Catherine's Point and [[Bonchurch]] is the largest area of landslip morphology in western Europe.\n\nThe north coast is unusual in having four high tides each day, with a double high tide every twelve and a half hours.  This arises because the western Solent is narrower than the eastern; the initial tide of water flowing from the west starts to ebb before the stronger flow around the south of the island returns through the eastern Solent to create a second high water.<ref name=\"Miscellany\"/>\n\n==Geology==\n{{main|Geology of the Isle of Wight}}\n\nThe Isle of Wight is made up of a variety of rock types dating from early [[Cretaceous]] (around 127&nbsp;million years ago) to the middle of the [[Palaeogene]] (around 30&nbsp;million years ago). The geological structure is dominated by a large [[monocline]] which causes a marked change in age of strata from the northern younger [[Tertiary]] beds to the older Cretaceous beds of the south. This gives rise to a [[Strike and dip|dip]] of almost 90 degrees in the chalk beds, seen best at [[the Needles]].\n\nThe northern half of the island is mainly composed of [[clay]]s, with the southern half formed of the [[chalk]] of the central east\u2013west downs, as well as Upper and Lower [[Greensand]]s and [[Wealden]] strata.<ref name=\"Hopson\">{{cite journal | url=http://nora.nerc.ac.uk/15996/1/Hopson_IoW_Geo_History_PGEOLA-D-11-00048R1.pdf | title=The geological history of the Isle of Wight: an overview of the 'diamond in Britain's geological crown' | author=Hopson P. | journal=Proceedings of the Geologists' Association | year=2011 | volume=122 | issue=5 | pages=745\u2013763 | doi=10.1016/j.pgeola.2011.09.007}}</ref> These strata continue west from the island across the [[Solent]] into [[Dorset]], forming the basin of [[Poole Harbour]] (Tertiary) and the [[Isle of Purbeck]] (Cretaceous) respectively. The chalky ridges of Wight and Purbeck were a single formation before they were breached by waters from the [[River Frome, Dorset|River Frome]] during the [[last glacial period|last ice age]], forming the Solent and turning Wight into an island. [[The Needles]], along with [[Old Harry Rocks]] on Purbeck, represent the edges of this breach.\n\nAll the rocks found on the island are [[sedimentary]], such as [[limestone]]s, [[mudstone]]s and [[sandstone]]s. They are rich in fossils; many can be seen exposed on beaches as the cliffs erode. [[Lignite|Lignitic coal]] is present in small quantities within seams, and can be seen on the cliffs and shore at [[Whitecliff Bay]]. Fossilised [[mollusc]]s have been found there, and also on the northern coast along with [[fossil]]ised [[crocodile]]s, [[turtle]]s and [[mammal]] bones; the youngest date back to around 30&nbsp;million years ago.\n\nThe island is one of the most important areas in Europe for [[dinosaur]] [[fossil]]s. The [[Erosion|eroding]] cliffs often reveal previously hidden remains, particularly along the [[Back of the Wight]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.redfunnel.co.uk/island-guide/isle-of-wight-activities/fossil-and-dinosaur-hunting/ |title=Fossil and Dinosaur Hunting|publisher=redfunnel.co.uk |accessdate=28 November 2016}}</ref> [[Dinosaur]] bones and [[ichnite|fossilised footprints]] can be seen in and on the rocks exposed around the island's beaches, especially at [[Yaverland]] and [[Compton Bay]]. As a result, the island has been nicknamed \"Dinosaur Island\" and [[Dinosaur Isle]] was established in 2001.\n\nThe area was affected by sea level changes during the repeated [[Quaternary]] glaciations. The island probably became separated from the mainland about 125,000 years ago, during the [[Eemian|Ipswichian]] [[interglacial]].<ref name=\"Booth&Brayson\">{{cite journal | url=https://core.ac.uk/download/files/79/386230.pdf | title=Geology, landscape and human interactions: examples from the Isle of Wight | author=Booth K.A. & Brayson J. | journal=Proceedings of the Geologists' Association | year=2011 | volume=122 | issue=5 | pages=938\u2013948 | doi=10.1016/j.pgeola.2011.01.004}}</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Isle of Wight OS OpenData map.png|[[Ordnance Survey]] map of the island\nFile:IOW geology.svg|Geological map of the island\nFile:Blackgang Chine c1910 - Project Gutenberg eText 17296.jpg|[[Blackgang Chine]], circa 1910\nFile:Isle of Wight coastline.jpg|A view of [[the Needles]] and [[Alum Bay]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Climate==\nLike the rest of the UK, the island has an [[oceanic climate]], but is somewhat milder and sunnier, which makes it a holiday destination.

England|largest and second-most populous]] island in England. It is in the [[English Channel]], between 2 and 5 miles off the coast of [[Hampshire]], separated by the [[Solent]]. The island has resorts that have been holiday destinations since [[Victorian era|Victorian times]], and is known for its mild climate, coastal scenery, and verdant landscape of fields, [[downland]] and [[chines]].  The island is designated a [[UNESCO Biosphere Reserve]].\n\nThe island has been home to the poets [[Algernon Charles Swinburne|Swinburne]] and [[Alfred Lord Tennyson|Tennyson]] and to [[Queen Victoria]], who built her much-loved summer residence and final home [[Osborne House]] at [[East Cowes]].  It has a maritime and industrial tradition including [[Isle of Wight#Neolithic Isle of Wight|boat-building]], sail-making, the manufacture of [[flying boat]]s, the [[hovercraft]], and Britain's [[British space programme|space rockets]]. The island hosts annual music festivals including the [[Isle of Wight Festival]], which in 1970 was the largest rock music event ever held.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.redfunnel.co.uk/island-guide/isle-of-wight-music-festivals-and-concerts/isle-of-wight-festival/iow-festival-history |title=Isle of Wight Festival history |publisher=Redfunnel.co.uk|accessdate=25 September 2010}}</ref> It has well-conserved wildlife and some of the richest cliffs and quarries for [[dinosaur]] [[fossil]]s in Europe.\n\nThe isle was owned by a Norman family until 1293 and was earlier a [[Wihtwara|kingdom in its own right]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/learn/story-of-england/medieval-part-1/isabella-de-fortibus/|title=Isabella de Fortibus, \"Queen of the Wight\" - English Heritage}}</ref> In common with the [[Crown dependencies]], the British Crown was then represented on the island by the [[Governor of the Isle of Wight]]{{refn|As well as the former Princess Beatrice during World War II, most otherwise notable was [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Mountbatten]] in 1969\u20131974, after which he became [[Lord Lieutenant]] until his assassination in 1979.|group= n}} until 1995. The island has played an important part in the defence of the ports of [[Southampton]] and [[Portsmouth]], and been near the front-line of conflicts through the ages, including the [[Spanish Armada]] and the [[Battle of Britain]].

The river flowed eastward from Dorset, following the course of the modern Solent strait, before travelling south and southwest towards the major Channel River system. \n\nThe earliest evidence of archaic human presence on what is now the Isle of Wight is found at [[Priory Bay]]. Here more than 300 [[Acheulean|acheulean handaxes]] have been recovered from the beach and cliff slopes, originating from a sequence of Pleistocene gravels dating approximately to [[Marine Isotope Stage 11|MIS 11]] (424,000-374,000 years ago).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wenban-Smith|first=Francis|title=The Pleistocene sequence at Priory Bay, Isle of Wight (SZ 635 900)|url=https://www.academia.edu/1794967/The_Pleistocene_sequence_at_Priory_Bay_Isle_of_Wight_SZ_635_900_|language=en}}</ref>\n\nA Mousterian flint assemblage, consisting of 50 handaxes and debitage has been recovered from Great Pan Farm near Newport. Possibly dating to MIS 7 (c.240,000 years ago), these tools are associated with Neanderthal occupation. \n\n=== Mesolithic Isle of Wight ===\nA submerged escarpment 11m below sea level off [[Bouldnor Cliff]] on the island's northwest coastline is home to an internationally significant mesolithic archaeological site. The site has yielded evidence of seasonal occupation by mesolithic hunter-gatherers dating to c.8000 years BP.  Finds include flint tools, burnt flint, worked timbers, wooden platforms and pits. The worked wood shows evidence of the splitting of large planks from oak trunks, interpreted as being intended for use as dug-out canoes. DNA analysis of sediments at the site yielded wheat DNA, not found in Britain until the [[Neolithic]] 2000 years after the occupation at Bouldnor Cliff. It has been suggested this is evidence of wide-reaching trade in mesolithic Europe, however the contemporaneity of the wheat with the Mesolithic occupation has been contested. When hunter-gatherers used the site it was located on a river bank surrounded by wetland and woodland.<ref>https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/8000-year-old-boat-building-platform-found-coast-britain-180972989/</ref> As sea levels rose throughout the [[Holocene]] the river valley slowly flooded, submerging the site.\n\nEvidence of mesolithic occupation on the island is generally found along the river valleys, particularly along the north of the Island, and in the former catchment of the western Yar. Further key sites are found at Newtown Creek, Werrar and Wootton-Quarr. \n\n=== Neolithic Isle of Wight ===\nNeolithic occupation on the Isle of Wight is primarily attested to by flint tools and monuments. Unlike the previous mesolithic hunter-gatherer population Neolithic communities on the Isle of Wight were based on farming and linked to a wide-scale migration of Neolithic populations from France and northwest Europe to Britain c.6000 years ago. \n\nThe Isle of Wight's most visible Neolithic site is the Longstone at [[Mottistone]], the remains of a [[Long barrow|long-barrow]] originally constructed with two standing stones at the entrance. Only one stone remains standing today. A Neolithic mortuary enclosure has been identified on [[Tennyson Down]] near [[Freshwater, Isle of Wight|Freshwater]]. \n\n===Bronze and Iron Age Isle of Wight===\n[[Bronze Age Britain]] had large reserves of tin in the areas of [[Cornwall]] and [[Devon]] and [[tin]] is necessary to [[smelting|smelt]] [[bronze]]. At that time the sea level was much lower and carts of tin were brought across the [[Solent]] at low tide<ref name=\"Adams 1877\">{{cite book|last1=Adams|first1=William Henry Davenport|title=Nelsons' hand-book to the Isle of Wight|date=1877|publisher=Oxford University|url=https://books.google.com/?id=hQoHAAAAQAAJ&dq=Cotentin+Peninsula+trade+Isle+of+Wight|accessdate=16 March 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Hawkes 1984\"/> for export, possibly on the [[Ferriby Boats]].

From the Anglo-Saxon period Latin ''Vecta'', Old English ''Wiht'' and Old Welsh forms ''Gueid'' and ''Guith'' are recorded. In [[Domesday Book]] it is ''Wit''; the modern Welsh name is ''Ynys Wyth'' (''ynys'' = island). These are all variant forms of the same name, possibly Celtic in origin. It may mean \"place of the division\", because the island divides the two arms of the Solent.<ref>[[Eilert Ekwall]], ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-Names'', 4th ed. (Oxford University Press, 1960) p. 518</ref><ref>[[A. L. F.

Slightly more than half, mainly in the west, is designated as the [[Isle of Wight AONB|Isle of Wight Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]].  The island has {{convert|258|km2|abbr=on|order=flip}} of farmland, {{convert|52|km2|abbr=on|order=flip}} of developed areas, and {{convert|57|mi}} of coastline. Its landscapes are diverse, leading to its oft-quoted description as \"England in miniature\".  In June 2019 the whole island was designated a [[Man and the Biosphere Programme|UNESCO Biosphere Reserve]], recognising the sustainable relationships between its residents and the local environment.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hampshire-48692295|date=19 June 2019|accessdate=20 June 2019|website=www.bbc.co.uk|title=Isle of Wight joins Unesco's network of biosphere sites}}</ref>\n\nWest Wight is predominantly rural, with dramatic coastlines dominated by the [[chalk]] [[downland]] ridge, running across the whole island and ending in [[the Needles]] stacks.  The southwestern quarter is commonly referred to as the [[Back of the Wight]], and has a unique character. The highest point on the island is [[St Boniface Down]] in the south east, which at {{convert|241|m|ft|order=flip}} is a [[Marilyn (hill)|marilyn]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://peakbagger.com/peak.aspx?pid=9547|title=St Boniface Down, England |author=Staff writer(s); no by-line| date=1987\u20132012| publisher=Peakbagger.com |accessdate=11 December 2012}}</ref> The most notable habitats on the rest of the island are probably the soft cliffs and sea ledges, which are scenic features, important for wildlife, and internationally protected.\n\nThe island has three principal rivers. The [[River Medina]] flows north into the [[Solent]], the [[Eastern Yar (river), Isle of Wight|Eastern Yar]] flows roughly northeast to [[Bembridge]] Harbour, and the [[Western Yar (river), Isle of Wight|Western Yar]] flows the short distance from [[Freshwater Bay, Isle of Wight|Freshwater Bay]] to a relatively large estuary at [[Yarmouth, Isle of Wight|Yarmouth]].  Without human intervention the sea might well have split the island into three: at the west end where a bank of pebbles separates Freshwater Bay from the [[marsh]]y backwaters of the Western Yar east of Freshwater, and at the east end where a thin strip of land separates [[Sandown Bay]] from the marshy Eastern Yar basin.\n\nThe [[Undercliff]] between St Catherine's Point and [[Bonchurch]] is the largest area of landslip morphology in western Europe.\n\nThe north coast is unusual in having four high tides each day, with a double high tide every twelve and a half hours.  This arises because the western Solent is narrower than the eastern; the initial tide of water flowing from the west starts to ebb before the stronger flow around the south of the island returns through the eastern Solent to create a second high water.<ref name=\"Miscellany\"/>\n\n==Geology==\n{{main|Geology of the Isle of Wight}}\n\nThe Isle of Wight is made up of a variety of rock types dating from early [[Cretaceous]] (around 127&nbsp;million years ago) to the middle of the [[Palaeogene]] (around 30&nbsp;million years ago). The geological structure is dominated by a large [[monocline]] which causes a marked change in age of strata from the northern younger [[Tertiary]] beds to the older Cretaceous beds of the south. This gives rise to a [[Strike and dip|dip]] of almost 90 degrees in the chalk beds, seen best at [[the Needles]].\n\nThe northern half of the island is mainly composed of [[clay]]s, with the southern half formed of the [[chalk]] of the central east\u2013west downs, as well as Upper and Lower [[Greensand]]s and [[Wealden]] strata.<ref name=\"Hopson\">{{cite journal | url=http://nora.nerc.ac.uk/15996/1/Hopson_IoW_Geo_History_PGEOLA-D-11-00048R1.pdf | title=The geological history of the Isle of Wight: an overview of the 'diamond in Britain's geological crown' | author=Hopson P. | journal=Proceedings of the Geologists' Association | year=2011 | volume=122 | issue=5 | pages=745\u2013763 | doi=10.1016/j.pgeola.2011.09.007}}</ref> These strata continue west from the island across the [[Solent]] into [[Dorset]], forming the basin of [[Poole Harbour]] (Tertiary) and the [[Isle of Purbeck]] (Cretaceous) respectively. The chalky ridges of Wight and Purbeck were a single formation before they were breached by waters from the [[River Frome, Dorset|River Frome]] during the [[last glacial period|last ice age]], forming the Solent and turning Wight into an island. [[The Needles]], along with [[Old Harry Rocks]] on Purbeck, represent the edges of this breach.\n\nAll the rocks found on the island are [[sedimentary]], such as [[limestone]]s, [[mudstone]]s and [[sandstone]]s. They are rich in fossils; many can be seen exposed on beaches as the cliffs erode. [[Lignite|Lignitic coal]] is present in small quantities within seams, and can be seen on the cliffs and shore at [[Whitecliff Bay]]. Fossilised [[mollusc]]s have been found there, and also on the northern coast along with [[fossil]]ised [[crocodile]]s, [[turtle]]s and [[mammal]] bones; the youngest date back to around 30&nbsp;million years ago.\n\nThe island is one of the most important areas in Europe for [[dinosaur]] [[fossil]]s. The [[Erosion|eroding]] cliffs often reveal previously hidden remains, particularly along the [[Back of the Wight]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.redfunnel.co.uk/island-guide/isle-of-wight-activities/fossil-and-dinosaur-hunting/ |title=Fossil and Dinosaur Hunting|publisher=redfunnel.co.uk |accessdate=28 November 2016}}</ref> [[Dinosaur]] bones and [[ichnite|fossilised footprints]] can be seen in and on the rocks exposed around the island's beaches, especially at [[Yaverland]] and [[Compton Bay]]. As a result, the island has been nicknamed \"Dinosaur Island\" and [[Dinosaur Isle]] was established in 2001.\n\nThe area was affected by sea level changes during the repeated [[Quaternary]] glaciations.

One of the most successful agricultural sectors is now the growing of crops under cover, particularly salad crops including [[tomato]]es and [[cucumber]]s. The island has a warmer climate and a longer growing season than much of the United Kingdom. [[Garlic]] has been successfully grown in [[Newchurch, Isle of Wight|Newchurch]] for many years, and is even exported to France.
