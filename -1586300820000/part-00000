The games began on December 20, 2019, and, aside from the all-star games that followed, ended with the [[2020 College Football Playoff National Championship]] played on January 13, 2020.\n\nThe total of 40 team-competitive bowls in FBS, including the national championship game, was unchanged from the previous season. With the first staging of the [[Hula Bowl]] since January 2008, the number of all-star games increased from three to four.\n\n==Schedule==\nThe schedule for the 2019\u201320 bowl games is below. All times are [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]] ([[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]\u22125). The schedule consists of 40 bowl games in FBS (the [[New Year's Six]] bowl games, 33 additional bowl games, and the [[College Football Playoff National Championship|National Championship game]]) and one bowl game in FCS (the [[Celebration Bowl]]). [[List of college bowl games#Division II bowls|Division II bowls]] and [[List of college bowl games#Division III bowls|Division III bowls]] are not included here. After the National Championship game, there are additionally four all-star games scheduled.\n\n===College Football Playoff and Championship Game===\nThe [[College Football Playoff]] system is used to determine a national championship of Division I FBS college football. A 13-member committee of experts [[2019 NCAA Division I FBS football rankings#CFP Rankings|ranked]] the top 25 teams in the nation after each of the last seven weeks of the regular season. The top four teams in the final ranking were seeded in a single-elimination semifinal round, with the winners advancing to the National Championship game.\n\nThe semifinal games for the 2019\u201320 season were the [[2019 Fiesta Bowl (December)|Fiesta Bowl]] and the [[2019 Peach Bowl|Peach Bowl]]. Both were played on December 28, 2019, as part of a yearly rotation of three pairs of six bowls, commonly referred to as the New Year's Six bowl games. The winners advanced to the [[2020 College Football Playoff National Championship]] at [[Mercedes-Benz Superdome]] in [[New Orleans|New Orleans, Louisiana]], scheduled for January 13, 2020.\n\n[[File:Mercedes-Benz Superdome Poydras bike.JPG|thumb|right|[[Mercedes-Benz Superdome]], site of the [[2020 College Football Playoff National Championship|National Championship]]

The games began on December 20, 2019, and, aside from the all-star games that followed, ended with the [[2020 College Football Playoff National Championship]] played on January 13, 2020.\n\nThe total of 40 team-competitive bowls in FBS, including the national championship game, was unchanged from the previous season. With the first staging of the [[Hula Bowl]] since January 2008, the number of all-star games increased from three to four.\n\n==Schedule==\nThe schedule for the 2019\u201320 bowl games is below. All times are [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]] ([[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]\u22125). The schedule consists of 40 bowl games in FBS (the [[New Year's Six]] bowl games, 33 additional bowl games, and the [[College Football Playoff National Championship|National Championship game]]) and one bowl game in FCS (the [[Celebration Bowl]]). [[List of college bowl games#Division II bowls|Division II bowls]] and [[List of college bowl games#Division III bowls|Division III bowls]] are not included here. After the National Championship game, there are additionally four all-star games scheduled.\n\n===College Football Playoff and Championship Game===\nThe [[College Football Playoff]] system is used to determine a national championship of Division I FBS college football. A 13-member committee of experts [[2019 NCAA Division I FBS football rankings#CFP Rankings|ranked]] the top 25 teams in the nation after each of the last seven weeks of the regular season. The top four teams in the final ranking were seeded in a single-elimination semifinal round, with the winners advancing to the National Championship game.\n\nThe semifinal games for the 2019\u201320 season were the [[2019 Fiesta Bowl (December)|Fiesta Bowl]] and the [[2019 Peach Bowl|Peach Bowl]]. Both were played on December 28, 2019, as part of a yearly rotation of three pairs of six bowls, commonly referred to as the New Year's Six bowl games. The winners advanced to the [[2020 College Football Playoff National Championship]] at [[Mercedes-Benz Superdome]] in [[New Orleans|New Orleans, Louisiana]], scheduled for January 13, 2020.\n\n[[File:Mercedes-Benz Superdome Poydras bike.JPG|thumb|right|[[Mercedes-Benz Superdome]], site of the [[2020 College Football Playoff National Championship|National Championship]]

At the time of the ''[[Domesday Book]]'' the village had a population of around 120. The [[Normans]] built a wooden [[motte-and-bailey]] edifice known as [[Waytemore Castle]] (see below).\n\nOnly the [[baptismal font]] survives from the Norman Church of St Michael, which was rebuilt in the early 15th century and altered and restored in the 17th and 19th centuries. Its conspicuous [[bell tower|belfry]] and [[spire]] were built in 1812.\n[[File:Bishop's Stortford 3.JPG|thumb|left|240px|St Michael's Church]]\nDespite outbreaks of the [[Bubonic plague|plague]] in the 16th and 17th centuries, the town continued to grow, reaching a population of about 1,200.\n\nThe [[Stort Navigation|River Stort]] is named after the town, and not the town after the river. When [[cartographer]]s visited the town in the 16th century, they reasoned that the town must have been named after the ford over the river and assumed the river was called the Stort.<ref name=\"Origin of name of river Stort\">{{cite web |title=Bishop's Stortford & Thorley: A History and Guide |url=http://www.stortfordhistory.co.uk/guide11/stort-navigation/ |accessdate=27 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nAfter 1769, the River Stort was made navigable, and the town became a stop on the [[mail coach]] road between [[Cambridge]] and London.\n\nBy 1801, Bishop's Stortford was a [[market town]], and a [[corn exchange]] had been established, while the main industry was [[malting]]. In 1842 the railway came to Bishop's Stortford. Another Victorian advance was the opening of a hospital in 1895.\n\nIn 1901 the population exceeded 7,000. The 1901 house known as Carfield Castle was used as an officers' [[billet]] in [[World War I]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Fit for a princess|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2630350/Fit-princess-Seven-bedroom-castle-turrets-romantic-gardens-2m-Prince-Charming-not-included.html |newspaper=Daily Mail}}</ref>\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Bishop's Stortford was the evacuation centre for many Britons, including [[Clapton Girls Technology College]]. By 1951, Bishop's Stortford's population had reached 13,000, and growth as a commuter town continued through the second half of the 20th century. The [[M11 motorway]], [[Stansted Airport]], and rail links to London and Cambridge contributed to its rise in population to almost 38,000 at the time of the 2011 census.<ref name=ONS/>\n\nOf the six suburbs of [[Thorley, Hertfordshire|Thorley]], Thorley Park, Havers, Bishop's Park, St Michael's Mead and Hockerill, the last is a separate ecclesiastical parish east of the River Stort, centred around the old coaching inns, [[All Saints' Church, Hockerill|All Saints]] in Stansted Road and the [[Bishop's Stortford railway station|railway station]]. Postwar development has enlarged the town's area further.\n\n===Incidents===\n[[File:CornExchange.jpg|300px|thumb|The Corn Exchange]]\nIn March and April 1825, a number of buildings in Bishop's Stortford were set alight, causing great alarm. A committee that formed offered a \u00a3500 reward for information on the arsonist. Several threatening letters were received, warning, for example, that \"Stortford shall be laid in ashes\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stortfordhistory.co.uk/guide1/devoils-lane/ |title=Guide 1: Devoils Lane - Bishop's Stortford & Thorley - A History & Guide|website=Stortfordhistory.co.uk |accessdate=26 October 2017}}</ref> Thomas Rees was arrested and found guilty on the charge of sending the letters, but not of arson. He was [[transported to Australia]] as a convict.\n\nIn 1935 the parish church of [[All Saints' Church, Hockerill|All Saints]] was destroyed by fire, and in 1937 a new church, to a spacious, light, and airy design by the architect [[Stephen Dykes Bower]], was erected in its place. This is a Grade II listed building and the tower dominates the eastern skyline of the town. The church contains a notable [[rose window]] designed by [[Hugh Ray Easton]] and a two-manual [[Henry Willis]] II organ. Concerts are also held there.\n\nOn 28 August 2007, two men and a teenager were shot dead at Plaw Hatch Close. Two women were seriously injured in the evening attack. Police presence was dramatically increased after the incident. However, crime rates in the town are well below the national average.<ref>{{cite news |title=Two men arrested over Bishop's Stortford shooting |newspaper=The Independent |date=11 September 2007 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/two-men-arrested-over-bishops-stortford-shooting-401088.html |location=London |first=Sam |last=Marsden}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Girl, 3, survives fatal shooting |newspaper=BBC Online News |date=29 August 2007 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/beds/bucks/herts/6968619.stm}}</ref>\n\n===Castle Mound===\n{{Main|Waytemore Castle}}\n[[File:Waytemore Castle, Bishop' s Stortford - geograph.org.uk - 1764727.jpg|thumb|350px|Waytemore Castle, Bishop's Stortford]]\nWaytemore began as a [[motte and bailey]] castle in the time of [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]]. A rectangular great tower was added to the motte in the 12th century. It was improved in the 13th century under [[John of England|King John]] and a licence for [[crenellation]] was granted in the mid-14th century. It lost significance after the [[English Civil War|Civil War]] and was used as a prison in the 17th century.\n\nOnly earthworks, the large [[motte]], and the foundations of a square tower can now be seen.\n\n==Demography==\n*Population: 37,838<ref name=ONS/>\n*Median age: 36.0\n*Retirees: 15.93%\n*Unemployed: 1.63%\n*Educated to degree level: 25.83%\n*Full-time students: 2.27% (864)\n*Total migrants: 12.68% (4,829)\n*Average distance travelled to fixed place of work: 19.18&nbsp;km\n\n==Redevelopment==\nThe town centre recently underwent changes with the demolition of a [[multi-storey car park]] and surrounding area to make way for a new town centre area and city-type apartments and [[penthouses]] on the riverside and elsewhere. Jackson Square (a modern shopping complex) was rebuilt and an extension added. The Havers estate, on the edge of the town, is being redeveloped with new houses and flats. Bishop's Stortford is useful for a large number of Hertfordshire and Essex villages in its area, as most nearby towns are small.\n\n==Rhodes Arts Complex==\n[[File:North side Rhodes Arts Complex Museum Theatre Bishop's Stortford Hertfordshire England.jpg|thumb|350px|[[Rhodes Arts Complex]] theatre and museum]]\nThe [[Rhodes Arts Complex]] incorporates a theatre, cinema, dance studio and conference facilities.

The constituency covers many other settlements, including [[Hertford]].\n\nA controversial political issue for the town relates to the expansion of [[Stansted Airport]]. A protest group called [[Stop Stansted Expansion]] opposes growth at the airport and plans for a second runway.\n\nThe town has a Youth Council of students from the local schools, but the Town Council is said to be \"reviewing [its] operation in relation to its responsibilities.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bishopsstortford.org/youth-council |title=Archived copy |accessdate=14 November 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117030820/http://www.bishopsstortford.org/youth-council |archivedate=17 November 2015 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe [[International Monarchist League]] and the [[Constitutional Monarchy Association]] operate from the same address.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.monarchy.net/Contact.aspx |title=Constitutional Monarchy Association |website=Monarchy.net |accessdate=26 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2011 the Conservative council of Bishop's Stortford voted 13 to 3 in favour of cancelling its twinned status with [[Friedberg in der Wetterau]] in Germany and [[Villiers-sur-Marne]] in France.

The town is also home to many people working in the tourist industry, including hotels, catering and airline staff, as it is the closest large town to Stansted Airport. In total, about 85 per cent work in the services sector (2001 census). Bishop's Stortford is served both by [[high street]] chain stores and long-established family shops. The main retail streets are South Street, Potter Street, North Street and Hockerill Street. There is a modern shopping complex called Jackson Square. Market days are Thursday and Saturday, which consist of a selection of stalls with a variety of goods including bags and luggage, flowers, cards and clothing.\n\nBishop's Stortford [[Chamber of Commerce]] is the town's largest business organisation. It actively champions local projects and interests at local, regional and government level. Business Stortford is an initiative set up to showcase the town's unique location and encourage companies from the UK, Europe and beyond to relocate or expand their operations in the area. It is targeting European businesses seeking a base in the UK, international companies wanting a well-connected location in Europe and UK firms looking for first-class air transport links to Europe. Business Stortford is backed by Bishop's Stortford Chamber of Commerce and supported by the Hertfordshire Local Enterprise Partnership.\n\n==Local media==\nBishop's Stortford has a local newspaper, ''the Bishop's Stortford Independent'' based at 12 North Street, which has been the home of publishing in the town since 1861.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bishopsstortfordindependent.co.uk/home/about-us |title=About Us |website=bishopsstortfordindependent.co.uk |access-date=26 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:Bishop's Stortford Station.jpg|thumb|[[Bishop's Stortford railway station]]]]\nBishop's Stortford owes its continued growth to developments in transport.\n\n===Rail===\n[[Bishop's Stortford railway station]] is on the [[West Anglia Main Line]], and was first opened in 1842.

and {{convert|35|mi|km}} by rail from [[Liverpool Street station]]. Bishop's Stortford had an estimated population of 40,089 in 2017.<ref>http://www.citypopulation.de/php/uk-england-eastofengland.php?cityid=E34001711</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Edward VII driving through Bishops Stortford, October 1905.png|thumb|350px|King Edward VII driving through Bishop's Stortford, October 1905]]\nNothing is known of Bishop's Stortford until it became a small [[Roman Britain|Roman]] settlement on [[Stane Street (Colchester)|Stane Street]], the [[Roman roads|Roman road]] linking [[Braughing]] and [[Colchester]]. The settlement was probably abandoned in the 5th century after the break-up of the Roman Empire.<ref>Roman Britain [http://roman-britain.co.uk/places/bishops_stortford.htm Retrieved 7 February 2018.]</ref>\n\nA new [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] settlement grew up on the site, named ''Steort-ford'', the [[Ford (crossing)|ford]] at the tongue of land.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Hanks, Patrick |author2=Hodges, Flavia |author3=Mills, David |author4=Room, Adrian |title=The Oxford Names Companion |date=2002 |location=Oxford |publisher=the University Press |isbn=0198605617}}</ref> In 1060, [[William the Norman|William, Bishop of London]], bought Stortford manor and estate for \u00a38, leading to the town's modern name. At the time of the ''[[Domesday Book]]'' the village had a population of around 120. The [[Normans]] built a wooden [[motte-and-bailey]] edifice known as [[Waytemore Castle]] (see below).\n\nOnly the [[baptismal font]] survives from the Norman Church of St Michael, which was rebuilt in the early 15th century and altered and restored in the 17th and 19th centuries. Its conspicuous [[bell tower|belfry]] and [[spire]] were built in 1812.\n[[File:Bishop's Stortford 3.JPG|thumb|left|240px|St Michael's Church]]\nDespite outbreaks of the [[Bubonic plague|plague]] in the 16th and 17th centuries, the town continued to grow, reaching a population of about 1,200.\n\nThe [[Stort Navigation|River Stort]] is named after the town, and not the town after the river. When [[cartographer]]s visited the town in the 16th century, they reasoned that the town must have been named after the ford over the river and assumed the river was called the Stort.<ref name=\"Origin of name of river Stort\">{{cite web |title=Bishop's Stortford & Thorley: A History and Guide |url=http://www.stortfordhistory.co.uk/guide11/stort-navigation/ |accessdate=27 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nAfter 1769, the River Stort was made navigable, and the town became a stop on the [[mail coach]] road between [[Cambridge]] and London.\n\nBy 1801, Bishop's Stortford was a [[market town]], and a [[corn exchange]] had been established, while the main industry was [[malting]]. In 1842 the railway came to Bishop's Stortford. Another Victorian advance was the opening of a hospital in 1895.\n\nIn 1901 the population exceeded 7,000. The 1901 house known as Carfield Castle was used as an officers' [[billet]] in [[World War I]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Fit for a princess|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2630350/Fit-princess-Seven-bedroom-castle-turrets-romantic-gardens-2m-Prince-Charming-not-included.html |newspaper=Daily Mail}}</ref>\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Bishop's Stortford was the evacuation centre for many Britons, including [[Clapton Girls Technology College]]. By 1951, Bishop's Stortford's population had reached 13,000, and growth as a commuter town continued through the second half of the 20th century. The [[M11 motorway]], [[Stansted Airport]], and rail links to London and Cambridge contributed to its rise in population to almost 38,000 at the time of the 2011 census.<ref name=ONS/>\n\nOf the six suburbs of [[Thorley, Hertfordshire|Thorley]], Thorley Park, Havers, Bishop's Park, St Michael's Mead and Hockerill, the last is a separate ecclesiastical parish east of the River Stort, centred around the old coaching inns, [[All Saints' Church, Hockerill|All Saints]] in Stansted Road and the [[Bishop's Stortford railway station|railway station]]. Postwar development has enlarged the town's area further.\n\n===Incidents===\n[[File:CornExchange.jpg|300px|thumb|The Corn Exchange]]\nIn March and April 1825, a number of buildings in Bishop's Stortford were set alight, causing great alarm. A committee that formed offered a \u00a3500 reward for information on the arsonist. Several threatening letters were received, warning, for example, that \"Stortford shall be laid in ashes\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stortfordhistory.co.uk/guide1/devoils-lane/ |title=Guide 1: Devoils Lane - Bishop's Stortford & Thorley - A History & Guide|website=Stortfordhistory.co.uk |accessdate=26 October 2017}}</ref> Thomas Rees was arrested and found guilty on the charge of sending the letters, but not of arson. He was [[transported to Australia]] as a convict.\n\nIn 1935 the parish church of [[All Saints' Church, Hockerill|All Saints]] was destroyed by fire, and in 1937 a new church, to a spacious, light, and airy design by the architect [[Stephen Dykes Bower]], was erected in its place. This is a Grade II listed building and the tower dominates the eastern skyline of the town. The church contains a notable [[rose window]] designed by [[Hugh Ray Easton]] and a two-manual [[Henry Willis]] II organ. Concerts are also held there.\n\nOn 28 August 2007, two men and a teenager were shot dead at Plaw Hatch Close. Two women were seriously injured in the evening attack. Police presence was dramatically increased after the incident. However, crime rates in the town are well below the national average.<ref>{{cite news |title=Two men arrested over Bishop's Stortford shooting |newspaper=The Independent |date=11 September 2007 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/two-men-arrested-over-bishops-stortford-shooting-401088.html |location=London |first=Sam |last=Marsden}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Girl, 3, survives fatal shooting |newspaper=BBC Online News |date=29 August 2007 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/beds/bucks/herts/6968619.stm}}</ref>\n\n===Castle Mound===\n{{Main|Waytemore Castle}}\n[[File:Waytemore Castle, Bishop' s Stortford - geograph.org.uk - 1764727.jpg|thumb|350px|Waytemore Castle, Bishop's Stortford]]\nWaytemore began as a [[motte and bailey]] castle in the time of [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]]. A rectangular great tower was added to the motte in the 12th century. It was improved in the 13th century under [[John of England|King John]] and a licence for [[crenellation]] was granted in the mid-14th century. It lost significance after the [[English Civil War|Civil War]] and was used as a prison in the 17th century.\n\nOnly earthworks, the large [[motte]], and the foundations of a square tower can now be seen.\n\n==Demography==\n*Population: 37,838<ref name=ONS/>\n*Median age: 36.0\n*Retirees: 15.93%\n*Unemployed: 1.63%\n*Educated to degree level: 25.83%\n*Full-time students: 2.27% (864)\n*Total migrants: 12.68% (4,829)\n*Average distance travelled to fixed place of work: 19.18&nbsp;km\n\n==Redevelopment==\nThe town centre recently underwent changes with the demolition of a [[multi-storey car park]] and surrounding area to make way for a new town centre area and city-type apartments and [[penthouses]] on the riverside and elsewhere. Jackson Square (a modern shopping complex) was rebuilt and an extension added. The Havers estate, on the edge of the town, is being redeveloped with new houses and flats. Bishop's Stortford is useful for a large number of Hertfordshire and Essex villages in its area, as most nearby towns are small.\n\n==Rhodes Arts Complex==\n[[File:North side Rhodes Arts Complex Museum Theatre Bishop's Stortford Hertfordshire England.jpg|thumb|350px|[[Rhodes Arts Complex]] theatre and museum]]\nThe [[Rhodes Arts Complex]] incorporates a theatre, cinema, dance studio and conference facilities.

The constituency covers many other settlements, including [[Hertford]].\n\nA controversial political issue for the town relates to the expansion of [[Stansted Airport]]. A protest group called [[Stop Stansted Expansion]] opposes growth at the airport and plans for a second runway.\n\nThe town has a Youth Council of students from the local schools, but the Town Council is said to be \"reviewing [its] operation in relation to its responsibilities.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bishopsstortford.org/youth-council |title=Archived copy |accessdate=14 November 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117030820/http://www.bishopsstortford.org/youth-council |archivedate=17 November 2015 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe [[International Monarchist League]] and the [[Constitutional Monarchy Association]] operate from the same address.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.monarchy.net/Contact.aspx |title=Constitutional Monarchy Association |website=Monarchy.net |accessdate=26 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2011 the Conservative council of Bishop's Stortford voted 13 to 3 in favour of cancelling its twinned status with [[Friedberg in der Wetterau]] in Germany and [[Villiers-sur-Marne]] in France.

The town is also home to many people working in the tourist industry, including hotels, catering and airline staff, as it is the closest large town to Stansted Airport. In total, about 85 per cent work in the services sector (2001 census). Bishop's Stortford is served both by [[high street]] chain stores and long-established family shops. The main retail streets are South Street, Potter Street, North Street and Hockerill Street. There is a modern shopping complex called Jackson Square. Market days are Thursday and Saturday, which consist of a selection of stalls with a variety of goods including bags and luggage, flowers, cards and clothing.\n\nBishop's Stortford [[Chamber of Commerce]] is the town's largest business organisation. It actively champions local projects and interests at local, regional and government level. Business Stortford is an initiative set up to showcase the town's unique location and encourage companies from the UK, Europe and beyond to relocate or expand their operations in the area. It is targeting European businesses seeking a base in the UK, international companies wanting a well-connected location in Europe and UK firms looking for first-class air transport links to Europe. Business Stortford is backed by Bishop's Stortford Chamber of Commerce and supported by the Hertfordshire Local Enterprise Partnership.\n\n==Local media==\nBishop's Stortford has a local newspaper, ''the Bishop's Stortford Independent'' based at 12 North Street, which has been the home of publishing in the town since 1861.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bishopsstortfordindependent.co.uk/home/about-us |title=About Us |website=bishopsstortfordindependent.co.uk |access-date=26 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:Bishop's Stortford Station.jpg|thumb|[[Bishop's Stortford railway station]]]]\nBishop's Stortford owes its continued growth to developments in transport.\n\n===Rail===\n[[Bishop's Stortford railway station]] is on the [[West Anglia Main Line]], and was first opened in 1842.

Pete Evil) had been fronting his punk/rock' roll band, Hellride, for several years, but when this band broke up late in 2003, he decided form a heavy metal band, and  began to write material for his yet unnamed new band. In early January 2004 he formed Blood Tsunami.\n\nJ\u00f8rgen Nordli (a.k.a. Jay) joined on drums and the two immediately started rehearsing on Pete's material. The first Blood Tsunami song was \"Killing Spree\". Shortly after Pete found a bass player in Frode S\u00f8rskaar (a.k.a. Riff Randall) and Kristoffer S\u00f8rensen (a.k.a. Dor Amazon) joined on lead guitar.\n\nDuring the spring of 2004 this line up recorded a 4-song demo.<ref name=\"2004demo\">{{cite web| url=http://www.metalglory.de/interviews.php?nr=498| title=Blood Tsunami \"Norwegian Thrash Metal\"| publisher=metalglory.de| date=2007-04-16| quote=''Pete: The \"Thrash Metal\" album is our debut album, but we released two demos before we got here. The first demo was released back in 2004 just a few months after I formed the band. Back then there was a different drummer and a different guy on bass.''| accessdate=2013-03-07}}</ref> Blood Tsunami's debut live performance took place on August 24, 2004, at a small club in Oslo called Last Train, supporting for  Swedish death metal band [[Entombed (band)|Entombed]].\n\n===2005-2007===\nFrode S\u00f8rskaar didn't feel comfortable with playing metal, so Pete contacted his former bandmate from Hellride, Peter Bostr\u00f6m (a.k.a. Bosse). Bosse was into metal and the two had shared many drunken nights listening to Slayer and Judas Priest in the back of the Hellride van.\n\nWith Bosse on bass, Blood Tsunami decided to record another demo. During January 2005 they went to Sverre D\u00e6hli (Audiopain) who runs his own little studio called Fias Co Prod Studios. There they attempted to record a new song called \"Evil Unleashed\", but it soon became evident that Jay had problems behind the drumkit. Songs like \"Evil Unleashed\" and \"Stabbed To Death\" did not maintain the right speed and intensity that Pete wanted. Recording was stopped and, disappointed, the band returned to the rehearsal space. It was a tough decision as Jay had become a very good friend and was a devoted member of the band, but he had to go.\n\nAt this time, Pete had recently joined as the bass player of a punk band called Bomberos. Bomberos consisted of Bj\u00f8rn Hinkel, [[Sven Erik Kristiansen]] (a.k.a. Maniac, ex [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]], [[Skitliv]]) and Einar Sursj\u00f8 (a.k.a. Necrodevil of Infern\u00f6, [[Virus (Norwegian band)|Virus]], Beyond Dawn etc. ). Pete only played one concert with this band, but as Necrodevil decided to quit the Bomberos, little Bj\u00f8rn Hinkel soon hired a new drummer. During a few rehearsals with the new Bomberos drummer it was obvious to Pete that he needed this guy in Blood Tsunami.\n\nPete gave [[Faust (musician)|B\u00e5rd Eithun]] (a.k.a. Faust, ex- [[Emperor (band)|Emperor]], [[Aborym]], [[SCUM (band)|Scum]]) the Blood Tsunami demo from 2004 and asked if he would give it a try. Faust agreed and shortly after he became a permanent member of Blood Tsunami.<ref name=\"faust\">{{cite web| url=http://metalheartwebzine.oldiblog.com/?page=lastarticle&id=1298480| title=BLOOD TSUNAMI| quote=''My name is B\u00e5rd Eithun, aka Faust.

New songs on this demo included \"Evil Unleashed\", \"Infernal Final Carnage\", \"Suicide Anthem\", \"Stabbed To Death\" and a new version of \"Let Blood Rain\". Faust had the technical skills and the speed the band had been missing. Bosse also gave the band a new sound with his dark growling backing vocals. Another surprise on this demo was the track \"Suicide Anthem\" where Bosse provided clean vocals in the chorus. This was something Pete and Faust was very skeptical towards as they both despised bands who mixed aggressive vocals with clean vocals, but still it passed. Simply because Bosse's clean vocals lift the song to an unknown level.\n\n\"Suicide Anthem\" would not get an official release before it was included on the \"Castle of Skulls EP\" in 2009.\n\nDuring 2006, without much explanation, Bosse suddenly decided to leave the band. He was quickly replaced by Stig Atle Amundsen (a.k.a. Stu Manx, ex-[[Gluecifer]], ex-The Yum Yums).<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=23756| title=Blood Tsunami Set Release Date For Debut Album, \"Thrash Metal\"| date=2007-01-16| quote=''BLOOD TSUNAMI last year announced the addition of former GLUECIFER bassist Stu Manx to the group's ranks''| accessdate=2013-03-07}}</ref> With a new bass player the band started the long process of rehearsing old material instead of writing new songs. Just like Riff Randall, Stu Manx was also more into rock 'n roll and he soon lost interest. He started skipping rehearsals and rather quickly it became obvious that the guy wasn't too keen on\nplaying with Blood Tsunami. Pete, Dor and Faust continued as a trio.\n\nThe good news in the middle of the bass player-mess was that the 2005 demo secured Blood Tsunami a deal with Nocturnal Art Productions and Candlelight Recordings. The boss of Nocturnal Art Productions, Tomas Haugen (a.k.a. [[Samoth]]) is a good friend of Faust and they are both former members of legendary Norwegian Black Metal Band Emperor. Tomas gave Blood Tsunami a chance, but as he stated several times. \"This is not a favor for a friend. The music speaks for itself. If I didn't like the band I would have never signed them\".\n\nIn 2006, when it was time to sign contracts, Pete made a quick phone call to Bosse. The idea of recording an album was appealing and Bosse agreed to join Blood Tsunami again. Once again the band entered Lion Heart studios with \u00d8yvind Voldmo Larsen and embarked on the recording sessions with high spirits. \"Killing Spree\" was recorded for the third time in two years and other demo songs like \"Evil Unleashed\", \"Infernal Final Carnage\" and \"Stabbed To Death\" also made it onto the album. The latter was given a new title and became known as \"Torn Apart\". Unfortunately, but because of various reasons the album ended up with a production that became way too polished for the band's taste. In retrospect the band regret this and wished they had paid more attention to the actual producing process while recording the album.\n\nOne track on the album stood out and became a milestone in the band's career. The track was the instrumental called \"Godbeater\"; a ten-minute instrumental that bears resemblance to how Metallica sounded in the mid-1980s.{{fact|date=August 2019}} The track was born when Pete compiled a bunch of old riffs he had never used and soon it grew into this long grandiose instrumental.\n\nPete and Faust had already decided that they wanted Blood Tsunami to have a strong visual 1980s feeling. Pete wanted something in the vein of [[Lawere]]'s artwork for [[Kreator]]'s \"[[Pleasure To Kill]]\" and started looking for artists. At this time Lawere could not be found. Ken Kelly, another favorite of Pete's, never replied to the mails and Derek Riggs turned out to be too expensive. Then Pete started looking through some Marvel comics and found the name of [[Alexander Orlandelli Horley]]. Horley's drawing was exactly what Pete was looking for and he soon got in touch with the Italian born, US based, artist. Pete explained what kind of cover he wanted. -\"An evil warrior with a big scythe standing triumphant on top of a pile of mutilated corpses\". Alex Horley quickly delivered the goods and created one striking album cover. Pete also designed a new logo for the band.\n\nAt some point an idea for an album title came up. Pete suggested it would be funny to simply call the album ''[[Thrash Metal (album)|Thrash Metal]]''.<ref name=\"2004demo\" /> This turned out to be a bad idea as the music itself wasn't strictly \"thrash\" but also contained Death Metal and rock 'n roll influences. Pete's vocals was also a subject for debate as many listeners meant it was too Black Metal for Thrash Metal. Anyway, the band didn't think much about this until they started reading reviews where the album title was constantly being criticized. They soon understood that it had been a big mistake to give the album such a genre-binding title and as Pete later stated: -\"We kinda \"shot ourselves in the foot\" with that title as we gave everyone a golden opportunity to criticize us for not being enough thrash metal. Instead of listening to a good metal album they only heard what was wrong with it... Too bad. I deeply regret not calling the album \"Godbeater\". That would have been a much better title and it would've given the album its own identity and saved us from all the slagging and nagging by reporters and metalheads who thought we were pissing all over the heritage of thrash metal.\"<ref name=\"2005demo\" />\n\nBlood Tsunami's debut album \"Thrash Metal\" was released by Nocturnal Art Productions and [[Candlelight Records]] on March the 19th 2007. The album received very good reviews in the worldwide metal press and sold quite well.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.metalstorm.net/pub/review.php?review_id=4321| title=Blood Tsunami \u2013 Thrash Metal review| date=2007-06-04| publisher=metalstorm.net| accessdate=2013-03-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/37374/Blood-Tsunami-Thrash-Metal/| title=Blood Tsunami -Thrash Metal| date=2010-06-14| publisher=sputnikmusic.com| quote=''Review Summary: A blackened thrash assault of epic proportions.''| accessdate=2013-03-20}}</ref> Blood Tsunami soon went on a UK tour with their friends in [[Zyklon]] and the British Death Metal band Dead Beyond Buried.\n\n===2008 - 2009===\nThe band continued to play shows, mostly in Norway but also a few abroad and they made quick \"one off's\" in Italy and Denmark. The band had problems with going on longer tours as both Pete and Faust had family commitments. They spent much time rehearsing and Pete had soon composed enough material for a second album. During the fall of 2008 Blood Tsunami entered Lion Heart Studios with \u00d8yvind Voldmo Larsen for the third time  inthree years and began working on the album that later would be known as \"Grand Feast For Vultures\", which was released by Nocturnal Art Productions and [[Candlelight Records]] on April 27, 2009. The album was praised by the metal communities of the world and received critical acclaim. Once again Alex Horley made the artwork and by suggestions from Pete he came up with a grotesque painting of a rotten corpse hanging in the middle of a battlefield. A big vulture is picking out his eye. The triumphant warrior from the debut was now replaced with by rotting corpse, but still the album displayed a much more confident band compared to the debut album. This time Blood Tsunami had focused on the whole production and came up with a sound that did the material justice.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.metalunderground.com/reviews/details.cfm?releaseid=2082| title=Blood Tsunami \u2013 \"Grand Feast For Vultures\"| publisher=metalunderground.com| date=2009-06-05| accessdate=2013-03-07}}</ref>\n\nAs the lyrical content of \"Thrash Metal\" was all fictional stuff evolving around war, death and hell, \"Grand Feast For Vultures\" contained more personal lyrics. Pete had penned down his problems with alcohol and depression and all this was being screamed out in songs like \"Personal Exorcism\", \"Laid To Waste\" and \"One Step Closer To The Grave\". Lyrically, the opening track \"Castle of Skulls\" was more in the vein of the older material, but still if you read the lyrics they are written with a \"us against them\" theme and Pete later explained that the song was intended to be a battle cry for \"Metalheads against Posers\".\n\n\"Grand Feast for Vultures\" also contained an instrumental. This instrumental was composed by Pete during 2008 and contained an impressive amount of riffs, harmonies and time signatures. The big difference compared to the previous instrumental \"Godbeater\" was the introduction of [[new wave of British heavy metal|NWOBHM]] influences and the [[Iron Maiden]]-esque main themes.<ref name=\"Horsehead\">{{cite web| url=http://www.heavyhardes.de/interview-372-engl.html| title=Interview mit Blood Tsunami| publisher=heavyhardes.de| date=2009-05-09| quote=''Yeah, especially on the Horsehead Nebula track, which is entirely instrumental Pete's big fascination for NWOBHM and especially Iron Maiden really shines through. Anyway, I think this suits the music well and it has already become a sort of trademark for Blood Tsunami I think; to mix brutal thrash which some NWOBHM parts.''| accessdate=2013-03-20}}</ref> The new instrumental was first entitled \"Enceladus Rising\" and this title even made it on the first promotional copies that was shipped off to the US press and radio stations. This error explains why many Americans still calls this track for \"Enceladus Rising\". Before the actual booklet was being pressed Pete changed his mind and wanted the track to be called \"Horsehead Nebula\".<ref name=\"Horsehead\" /> Pete explained: - \"I wanted a title that both included something tremendously big and at the same time something very beautiful. Enceladus was one of the giants in Greek Mythology, but I reckon that he wasn't particularly beautiful. Enceladus is also the name given to one of the moons that goes in orbit around Saturn. That was more interesting and I started thinking about space... I digged up photos of various nebulas and in the back of my head I remembered a photos I had seen of this gigantic nebula with the shape of a horse head. I looked it up and the second I saw the photo I immediately knew I had the right title for the instrumental. The Horsehead Nebula is a dark nebula in the constellation Orion. It is located just to the south of the star Alnitak, which is farthest east on Orion's Belt, and is part of the much larger \"Orion Molecular Cloud Complex\". The latter is of course bigger, but to use that as a title would have linked our instrumental up to Metallica's \"Orion\" and it also sounds like something an industrial band would have called their album, so that option was quickly ditched\".\n\nHorsehead Nebula is the most challenging piece of music ever composed by Pete and it is being hailed as the masterpiece in the Blood Tsunami catalogue by both fans and press.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/reviews/compact_discs/blood_tsunami/grand_feast_for_vultures/index.html| title=Grand Feast For Vultures Review| publisher=ultimate-guitar.com| date=2009-05-22| quote=''Horsehead Nebula: 5.0/5 a 12 minute instrumental?

Namely [[Absu (band)|Absu]] and [[Nachtmystium]]. This set back compared with other booking problems made the band disgruntled and disappointed. The members and especially the driving force of Pete and Faust felt that they were working hard for little, or close to no reward. The once high spirits\nfell to an all-time low. Blood Tsunami played one show after the release of \"Grand Feast For Vultures\" and that show took place at Elm Street in Oslo in August 2009. Then Blood Tsunami disappeared.\n\n===2009 - 2013===\nDuring the summer of 2009 Pete had hooked up with his old friend Kristopher Schau (a.k.a. Max Cargo, ex- The Cumshots, Datsun, The Dogs, The Terrifieds). The two buddies used to play together in a punk band called Datsun in the late 1990s and Pete suggested: -\"Hey, let's start up a band that doesn't care about genres. Let's do something like Zeke and The Dwarves and just play our balls off, get drunk and raise hell\". Kristopher responded with a short \"Yes\" and they soon began to rehearse with Pete on guitar and Kristopher on vocals. The band was, for some stupid reason, called Mongo Ninja and both Faust and Dor became members of this band. The fifth member and bass player was Mads Martinsen. He works for an Oslo-based Booking Agency called Amber Booking. This connection resulted in a very busy touring schedule for the three Blood Tsunami guys. Once again Pete's creativity blossomed and within twelve months Mongo Ninja recorded and released three albums through the Oslo-based label, Indie Recordings. During this period Candlelight dropped Blood Tsunami and once again Bosse left the band. No one of the remaining Blood Tsunami members cared much about this as they were having a good time with Mongo Ninja.\n\nAfter three years of touring and partying Pete began to miss Blood Tsunami. He felt that Mongo Ninja had accomplished what they set out to do and that the fun-part had slowly been replaced with duties and responsibilities. Faust, Dor and Pete began rehearsing some new material Pete had written and soon a few new Blood Tsunami songs emerged. The first songs to be ready was called \"Metal Fang\", \"The Rape of Nanking\" and \"The Cruel Leading The Fool\". The lyrical content had changes during the Mongo Ninja years as Pete incorporated his Mongo Ninja trademark of writing lyrics about real persons and true crimes. Now they had to find a new bass player.\n\nPriscila Morales, (a.k.a. Proxy) a well known manager and booking agent in the Norwegian Metal scene, had gotten herself a new boyfriend. The chosen one was a Swedish longhaired punk rocker who played guitar in a punk band called Speedergarben. Pete asked Proxy if her new flame played bass and she quickly replied... \"He can play bass\".\n\nCarl Janfalk (a.k.a. Calle) showed up and during the very first rehearsal it was obvious that he was the right guy. No bullshit, no stress, no worries! Carl was in. Blood Tsunami entered Midrange Studios in January 2012 and together with engineer Anders Henningsen they recorded a new 6 track demo. The new demo displayed a band that had gotten harder, dirtier and meaner during their hiatus.

They got plenty of positive feedback and received some good offers, but this time they didn't want to rush things. Patiently they waited and finally Norway's own Indie Recordings had listened to the demo.

It turned out that Pete had seriously damaged his vocal chords and to get well he would need surgery. This set back forced them to postpone the recording session with almost two months. This break was spent to create the artwork and booklet. The whole graphic design was tailor-made to suit the new musical content of Blood Tsunami. Dark, filthyand all in black and white.

Pete Evil) had been fronting his punk/rock' roll band, Hellride, for several years, but when this band broke up late in 2003, he decided form a heavy metal band, and  began to write material for his yet unnamed new band. In early January 2004 he formed Blood Tsunami.\n\nJ\u00f8rgen Nordli (a.k.a. Jay) joined on drums and the two immediately started rehearsing on Pete's material. The first Blood Tsunami song was \"Killing Spree\". Shortly after Pete found a bass player in Frode S\u00f8rskaar (a.k.a. Riff Randall) and Kristoffer S\u00f8rensen (a.k.a. Dor Amazon) joined on lead guitar.\n\nDuring the spring of 2004 this line up recorded a 4-song demo.<ref name=\"2004demo\">{{cite web| url=http://www.metalglory.de/interviews.php?nr=498| title=Blood Tsunami \"Norwegian Thrash Metal\"| publisher=metalglory.de| date=2007-04-16| quote=''Pete: The \"Thrash Metal\" album is our debut album, but we released two demos before we got here. The first demo was released back in 2004 just a few months after I formed the band. Back then there was a different drummer and a different guy on bass.''| accessdate=2013-03-07}}</ref> Blood Tsunami's debut live performance took place on August 24, 2004, at a small club in Oslo called Last Train, supporting for  Swedish death metal band [[Entombed (band)|Entombed]].\n\n===2005-2007===\nFrode S\u00f8rskaar didn't feel comfortable with playing metal, so Pete contacted his former bandmate from Hellride, Peter Bostr\u00f6m (a.k.a. Bosse). Bosse was into metal and the two had shared many drunken nights listening to Slayer and Judas Priest in the back of the Hellride van.\n\nWith Bosse on bass, Blood Tsunami decided to record another demo. During January 2005 they went to Sverre D\u00e6hli (Audiopain) who runs his own little studio called Fias Co Prod Studios. There they attempted to record a new song called \"Evil Unleashed\", but it soon became evident that Jay had problems behind the drumkit. Songs like \"Evil Unleashed\" and \"Stabbed To Death\" did not maintain the right speed and intensity that Pete wanted. Recording was stopped and, disappointed, the band returned to the rehearsal space. It was a tough decision as Jay had become a very good friend and was a devoted member of the band, but he had to go.\n\nAt this time, Pete had recently joined as the bass player of a punk band called Bomberos. Bomberos consisted of Bj\u00f8rn Hinkel, [[Sven Erik Kristiansen]] (a.k.a. Maniac, ex [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]], [[Skitliv]]) and Einar Sursj\u00f8 (a.k.a. Necrodevil of Infern\u00f6, [[Virus (Norwegian band)|Virus]], Beyond Dawn etc. ). Pete only played one concert with this band, but as Necrodevil decided to quit the Bomberos, little Bj\u00f8rn Hinkel soon hired a new drummer. During a few rehearsals with the new Bomberos drummer it was obvious to Pete that he needed this guy in Blood Tsunami.\n\nPete gave [[Faust (musician)|B\u00e5rd Eithun]] (a.k.a. Faust, ex- [[Emperor (band)|Emperor]], [[Aborym]], [[SCUM (band)|Scum]]) the Blood Tsunami demo from 2004 and asked if he would give it a try. Faust agreed and shortly after he became a permanent member of Blood Tsunami.<ref name=\"faust\">{{cite web| url=http://metalheartwebzine.oldiblog.com/?page=lastarticle&id=1298480| title=BLOOD TSUNAMI| quote=''My name is B\u00e5rd Eithun, aka Faust.

New songs on this demo included \"Evil Unleashed\", \"Infernal Final Carnage\", \"Suicide Anthem\", \"Stabbed To Death\" and a new version of \"Let Blood Rain\". Faust had the technical skills and the speed the band had been missing. Bosse also gave the band a new sound with his dark growling backing vocals. Another surprise on this demo was the track \"Suicide Anthem\" where Bosse provided clean vocals in the chorus. This was something Pete and Faust was very skeptical towards as they both despised bands who mixed aggressive vocals with clean vocals, but still it passed. Simply because Bosse's clean vocals lift the song to an unknown level.\n\n\"Suicide Anthem\" would not get an official release before it was included on the \"Castle of Skulls EP\" in 2009.\n\nDuring 2006, without much explanation, Bosse suddenly decided to leave the band. He was quickly replaced by Stig Atle Amundsen (a.k.a. Stu Manx, ex-[[Gluecifer]], ex-The Yum Yums).<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=23756| title=Blood Tsunami Set Release Date For Debut Album, \"Thrash Metal\"| date=2007-01-16| quote=''BLOOD TSUNAMI last year announced the addition of former GLUECIFER bassist Stu Manx to the group's ranks''| accessdate=2013-03-07}}</ref> With a new bass player the band started the long process of rehearsing old material instead of writing new songs. Just like Riff Randall, Stu Manx was also more into rock 'n roll and he soon lost interest. He started skipping rehearsals and rather quickly it became obvious that the guy wasn't too keen on\nplaying with Blood Tsunami. Pete, Dor and Faust continued as a trio.\n\nThe good news in the middle of the bass player-mess was that the 2005 demo secured Blood Tsunami a deal with Nocturnal Art Productions and Candlelight Recordings. The boss of Nocturnal Art Productions, Tomas Haugen (a.k.a. [[Samoth]]) is a good friend of Faust and they are both former members of legendary Norwegian Black Metal Band Emperor. Tomas gave Blood Tsunami a chance, but as he stated several times. \"This is not a favor for a friend. The music speaks for itself. If I didn't like the band I would have never signed them\".\n\nIn 2006, when it was time to sign contracts, Pete made a quick phone call to Bosse. The idea of recording an album was appealing and Bosse agreed to join Blood Tsunami again. Once again the band entered Lion Heart studios with \u00d8yvind Voldmo Larsen and embarked on the recording sessions with high spirits. \"Killing Spree\" was recorded for the third time in two years and other demo songs like \"Evil Unleashed\", \"Infernal Final Carnage\" and \"Stabbed To Death\" also made it onto the album. The latter was given a new title and became known as \"Torn Apart\". Unfortunately, but because of various reasons the album ended up with a production that became way too polished for the band's taste. In retrospect the band regret this and wished they had paid more attention to the actual producing process while recording the album.\n\nOne track on the album stood out and became a milestone in the band's career. The track was the instrumental called \"Godbeater\"; a ten-minute instrumental that bears resemblance to how Metallica sounded in the mid-1980s.{{fact|date=August 2019}} The track was born when Pete compiled a bunch of old riffs he had never used and soon it grew into this long grandiose instrumental.\n\nPete and Faust had already decided that they wanted Blood Tsunami to have a strong visual 80's feeling. Pete wanted something in the vein of [[Lawere]]'s artwork for [[Kreator]]'s \"[[Pleasure To Kill]]\" and started looking for artists. At this time Lawere could not be found. Ken Kelly, another favorite of Pete's, never replied to the mails and Derek Riggs turned out to be too expensive. Then Pete started looking through some Marvel comics and found the name of [[Alexander Orlandelli Horley]]. Horley's drawing was exactly what Pete was looking for and he soon got in touch with the Italian born, US based, artist. Pete explained what kind of cover he wanted. -\"An evil warrior with a big scythe standing triumphant on top of a pile of mutilated corpses\". Alex Horley quickly delivered the goods and created one striking album cover. Pete also designed a new logo for the band.\n\nAt some point an idea for an album title came up. Pete suggested it would be funny to simply call the album ''[[Thrash Metal (album)|Thrash Metal]]''.<ref name=\"2004demo\" /> This turned out to be a bad idea as the music itself wasn't strictly \"thrash\" but also contained Death Metal and rock 'n roll influences. Pete's vocals was also a subject for debate as many listeners meant it was too Black Metal for Thrash Metal. Anyway, the band didn't think much about this until they started reading reviews where the album title was constantly being criticized. They soon understood that it had been a big mistake to give the album such a genre-binding title and as Pete later stated: -\"We kinda \"shot ourselves in the foot\" with that title as we gave everyone a golden opportunity to criticize us for not being enough thrash metal. Instead of listening to a good metal album they only heard what was wrong with it... Too bad. I deeply regret not calling the album \"Godbeater\". That would have been a much better title and it would've given the album its own identity and saved us from all the slagging and nagging by reporters and metalheads who thought we were pissing all over the heritage of thrash metal.\"<ref name=\"2005demo\" />\n\nBlood Tsunami's debut album \"Thrash Metal\" was released by Nocturnal Art Productions and [[Candlelight Records]] on March the 19th 2007. The album received very good reviews in the worldwide metal press and sold quite well.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.metalstorm.net/pub/review.php?review_id=4321| title=Blood Tsunami \u2013 Thrash Metal review| date=2007-06-04| publisher=metalstorm.net| accessdate=2013-03-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/37374/Blood-Tsunami-Thrash-Metal/| title=Blood Tsunami -Thrash Metal| date=2010-06-14| publisher=sputnikmusic.com| quote=''Review Summary: A blackened thrash assault of epic proportions.''| accessdate=2013-03-20}}</ref> Blood Tsunami soon went on a UK tour with their friends in [[Zyklon]] and the British Death Metal band Dead Beyond Buried.\n\n===2008 - 2009===\nThe band continued to play shows, mostly in Norway but also a few abroad and they made quick \"one off's\" in Italy and Denmark. The band had problems with going on longer tours as both Pete and Faust had family commitments. They spent much time rehearsing and Pete had soon composed enough material for a second album. During the fall of 2008 Blood Tsunami entered Lion Heart Studios with \u00d8yvind Voldmo Larsen for the third time  inthree years and began working on the album that later would be known as \"Grand Feast For Vultures\", which was released by Nocturnal Art Productions and [[Candlelight Records]] on April 27, 2009. The album was praised by the metal communities of the world and received critical acclaim. Once again Alex Horley made the artwork and by suggestions from Pete he came up with a grotesque painting of a rotten corpse hanging in the middle of a battlefield. A big vulture is picking out his eye. The triumphant warrior from the debut was now replaced with by rotting corpse, but still the album displayed a much more confident band compared to the debut album. This time Blood Tsunami had focused on the whole production and came up with a sound that did the material justice.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.metalunderground.com/reviews/details.cfm?releaseid=2082| title=Blood Tsunami \u2013 \"Grand Feast For Vultures\"| publisher=metalunderground.com| date=2009-06-05| accessdate=2013-03-07}}</ref>\n\nAs the lyrical content of \"Thrash Metal\" was all fictional stuff evolving around war, death and hell, \"Grand Feast For Vultures\" contained more personal lyrics. Pete had penned down his problems with alcohol and depression and all this was being screamed out in songs like \"Personal Exorcism\", \"Laid To Waste\" and \"One Step Closer To The Grave\". Lyrically, the opening track \"Castle of Skulls\" was more in the vein of the older material, but still if you read the lyrics they are written with a \"us against them\" theme and Pete later explained that the song was intended to be a battle cry for \"Metalheads against Posers\".\n\n\"Grand Feast for Vultures\" also contained an instrumental. This instrumental was composed by Pete during 2008 and contained an impressive amount of riffs, harmonies and time signatures. The big difference compared to the previous instrumental \"Godbeater\" was the introduction of [[new wave of British heavy metal|NWOBHM]] influences and the [[Iron Maiden]]-esque main themes.<ref name=\"Horsehead\">{{cite web| url=http://www.heavyhardes.de/interview-372-engl.html| title=Interview mit Blood Tsunami| publisher=heavyhardes.de| date=2009-05-09| quote=''Yeah, especially on the Horsehead Nebula track, which is entirely instrumental Pete's big fascination for NWOBHM and especially Iron Maiden really shines through. Anyway, I think this suits the music well and it has already become a sort of trademark for Blood Tsunami I think; to mix brutal thrash which some NWOBHM parts.''| accessdate=2013-03-20}}</ref> The new instrumental was first entitled \"Enceladus Rising\" and this title even made it on the first promotional copies that was shipped off to the US press and radio stations. This error explains why many Americans still calls this track for \"Enceladus Rising\". Before the actual booklet was being pressed Pete changed his mind and wanted the track to be called \"Horsehead Nebula\".<ref name=\"Horsehead\" /> Pete explained: - \"I wanted a title that both included something tremendously big and at the same time something very beautiful. Enceladus was one of the giants in Greek Mythology, but I reckon that he wasn't particularly beautiful. Enceladus is also the name given to one of the moons that goes in orbit around Saturn. That was more interesting and I started thinking about space... I digged up photos of various nebulas and in the back of my head I remembered a photos I had seen of this gigantic nebula with the shape of a horse head. I looked it up and the second I saw the photo I immediately knew I had the right title for the instrumental. The Horsehead Nebula is a dark nebula in the constellation Orion. It is located just to the south of the star Alnitak, which is farthest east on Orion's Belt, and is part of the much larger \"Orion Molecular Cloud Complex\". The latter is of course bigger, but to use that as a title would have linked our instrumental up to Metallica's \"Orion\" and it also sounds like something an industrial band would have called their album, so that option was quickly ditched\".\n\nHorsehead Nebula is the most challenging piece of music ever composed by Pete and it is being hailed as the masterpiece in the Blood Tsunami catalogue by both fans and press.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/reviews/compact_discs/blood_tsunami/grand_feast_for_vultures/index.html| title=Grand Feast For Vultures Review| publisher=ultimate-guitar.com| date=2009-05-22| quote=''Horsehead Nebula: 5.0/5 a 12 minute instrumental?

Namely [[Absu (band)|Absu]] and [[Nachtmystium]]. This set back compared with other booking problems made the band disgruntled and disappointed. The members and especially the driving force of Pete and Faust felt that they were working hard for little, or close to no reward. The once high spirits\nfell to an all-time low. Blood Tsunami played one show after the release of \"Grand Feast For Vultures\" and that show took place at Elm Street in Oslo in August 2009. Then Blood Tsunami disappeared.\n\n===2009 - 2013===\nDuring the summer of 2009 Pete had hooked up with his old friend Kristopher Schau (a.k.a. Max Cargo, ex- The Cumshots, Datsun, The Dogs, The Terrifieds). The two buddies used to play together in a punk band called Datsun in the late 90's and Pete suggested: -\"Hey, let's start up a band that doesn't care about genres. Let's do something like Zeke and The Dwarves and just play our balls off, get drunk and raise hell\". Kristopher responded with a short \"Yes\" and they soon began to rehearse with Pete on guitar and Kristopher on vocals. The band was, for some stupid reason, called Mongo Ninja and both Faust and Dor became members of this band. The fifth member and bass player was Mads Martinsen. He works for an Oslo-based Booking Agency called Amber Booking. This connection resulted in a very busy touring schedule for the three Blood Tsunami guys. Once again Pete's creativity blossomed and within twelve months Mongo Ninja recorded and released three albums through the Oslo-based label, Indie Recordings. During this period Candlelight dropped Blood Tsunami and once again Bosse left the band. No one of the remaining Blood Tsunami members cared much about this as they were having a good time with Mongo Ninja.\n\nAfter three years of touring and partying Pete began to miss Blood Tsunami. He felt that Mongo Ninja had accomplished what they set out to do and that the fun-part had slowly been replaced with duties and responsibilities. Faust, Dor and Pete began rehearsing some new material Pete had written and soon a few new Blood Tsunami songs emerged. The first songs to be ready was called \"Metal Fang\", \"The Rape of Nanking\" and \"The Cruel Leading The Fool\". The lyrical content had changes during the Mongo Ninja years as Pete incorporated his Mongo Ninja trademark of writing lyrics about real persons and true crimes. Now they had to find a new bass player.\n\nPriscila Morales, (a.k.a. Proxy) a well known manager and booking agent in the Norwegian Metal scene, had gotten herself a new boyfriend. The chosen one was a Swedish longhaired punk rocker who played guitar in a punk band called Speedergarben. Pete asked Proxy if her new flame played bass and she quickly replied... \"He can play bass\".\n\nCarl Janfalk (a.k.a. Calle) showed up and during the very first rehearsal it was obvious that he was the right guy. No bullshit, no stress, no worries! Carl was in. Blood Tsunami entered Midrange Studios in January 2012 and together with engineer Anders Henningsen they recorded a new 6 track demo. The new demo displayed a band that had gotten harder, dirtier and meaner during their hiatus. The songs was shorter, more in your face and stripped to the bone.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://ringmasterreviewintroduces.wordpress.com/2013/03/11/blood-tsunami-for-faen/| title=Blood Tsunami: For Faen| publisher=ringmasterreviewintroduces.wordpress.com| date=2013-03-11| quote=''Though the quintet was drawing strong acclaim and success the founding trio began looking at Blood Tsunami again and brought it back to life during 2012 but now infusing the punk essences of their last endeavour into the thrash devastation of their resurrected project.''| accessdate=2013-03-20}}</ref> Long gone was the NWOBHM influences, long gone was the Swedish sounding riffs, long gone was the screaming vocals and the growling backing vocals.

Blood Tsunami was reborn and appeared to be more pissed off, ferocious and vicious that ever before.\n\nThe quartet started playing live again and the first show for the new line up took place at Revolver in Oslo on February 25, 2012, as support for the British thrash band Virus.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.revolveroslo.no/nb/program/virus-uk-black-magic-blood-tsunami| title=VIRUS (UK) + BLACK MAGIC + BLOOD TSUNAMI| publisher=revolveroslo.no| accessdate=2013-03-07| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227142602/http://www.revolveroslo.no/nb/program/virus-uk-black-magic-blood-tsunami| archive-date=2012-02-27| url-status=dead}}</ref> One month later Blood Tsunami entered Unholy Pub in Oslo and supported Grave Desecrator from Brazil.\n\nBlood Tsunami was looking for a new label and the demo was shipped off to a few candidates. They got plenty of positive feedback and received some good offers, but this time they didn't want to rush things. Patiently they waited and finally Norway's own Indie Recordings had listened to the demo. A deal was signed and once again Blood Tsunami could enter the studio.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=88493| title=Blood Tsunami Signs With Indie Recordings To Release \"For Faen\"| publisher=metalunderground.com| date=2013-01-25| quote=''Indie Recordings is proud to announce the signing of Blood Tsunami and the release of the band's new album \u201cFor Faen\u201d this coming March 11th in Europe, March 8th in Norway, and March 15th in Germany and Austria''| accessdate=2013-02-10}}</ref> In June 2012 they started the recording sessions at Sverre D\u00e6hli's Fias Co Prod Studios where Faust nailed the drums within a few hours. Then they continued in Midrange Studios with Anders Henningsen and things was looking good.\n\nProblems occurred when it was time to lay down the vocals. It turned out that Pete had seriously damaged his vocal chords and to get well he would need surgery. This set back forced them to postpone the recording session with almost two months. This break was spent to create the artwork and booklet. The whole graphic design was tailor-made to suit the new musical content of Blood Tsunami. Dark, filthyand all in black and white. American artist Christian Sloan Hall designed the artwork, Norwegian photographer Kjell Ivar Lund took the band photos and Pete once again designed a new band logo. The outcome is hard, mean and \"in your face\". Just like the music!\n\nThe new album has a Norwegian title. It is called \"For Faen!\" and according to the press release this is one of the most common words in the Norwegian language. \"For Faen\" can be translated into two things. Directly translated it means \"For The Devil\", but it can also mean something like \"For Fuck's Sake\".<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=186868| title=BLOOD TSUNAMI: 'Metal Fang' Video Released| publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]| date=2013-02-28| quote=''According to a press release, \"For Faen\" \"shows a band that has stripped their metal to the bone.

The football team currently plays in [[3. Liga]] which is the third tier in German football. Preu\u00dfen M\u00fcnster also fields teams in [[tennis]], [[Sport of athletics|athletics]], [[handball]] and [[fistball]].\n\n==History==\nThe club was founded as FC Preu\u00dfen on 30 April 1906 and has its roots in a group formed at the Johann-Conrad-Schlaun Grammar School. Historians consider patriotic reasons for naming the club after Prussia. At first the club did not have its own ground and was playing at a parade ground of the army at Loddenheide. General Baron von Bissing gave permission only if the goals would be taken down again after training. On 24 June 1907 the Eagles won their first game against FC Osnabr\u00fcck with 5\u20130. After successfully applying for the Western German League system, the team initially competed in the second tier. In 1908 the Eagles were promoted to the first league and in 1914 they won the Westphalian Championship. Between 1916 and 1926 the club played on M\u00fcnstermannplatz, which was close to the current ground, the [[Preu\u00dfenstadion]]. In 1921 they won the Championship a second time and also took on their current name.<ref>Dahlkamp, Hubert; Schulze-Marmeling, Dietrich (2006). 100 Jahre Preu\u00dfen M\u00fcnster. G\u00f6ttingen: Die Werkstatt GmbH. S. 13\u201330. {{ISBN|978-3-89533-519-8}}.</ref>\n\nIn 1933, Preu\u00dfen advanced to the [[Gauliga Westfalen]], one of sixteen top-flight leagues established through the re-organization of German football under the [[Third Reich]]. They earned only mediocre results there and were relegated twice. Their second demotion in 1941 left them out of first division football until after World War II.\n[[File:Preussen Munster Performance Chart.png|260px|thumb|Historical chart of Preu\u00dfen M\u00fcnster league performance after WWII]]\n\nThe team played three seasons in the Landesliga Westfalen Gr. 2 (II) before returning to the top-flight in the [[Oberliga West]] in the 1948\u201349 season. That arrival was accompanied by some notoriety, as Preu\u00dfen M\u00fcnster became the first German football club to build a team by buying players, something previously unheard of in a country committed to the ideal of amateurism. Siegfried Rachuba, Adolf Preissler, Rudolf Schulz, [[Felix Gerritzen]], and Josef Lammers formed a front five dubbed by the press as the \"Hundred-Thousand-Mark Line\", even though that much money never did change hands. Rachuba is still M\u00fcnsters most successful first tier striker of all times with 97 goals in 238 games.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Dahlkamp|first1=Hubert|last2=Schulze-Marmeling|first2=Dietrich|title=100 Jahre Preu\u00dfen M\u00fcnster|date=2006|publisher=Die Werkstatt GmbH|location=G\u00f6ttingen|isbn=978-3-89533-519-8|pages=62\u201365}}</ref>\n\nThe investment paid dividends as the club appeared in the 1951 national final in front of 107,000 spectators at Berlin's Olympic Stadium against [[1. FC Kaiserslautern]]. Preu\u00dfen striker Gerritzen scored first but the team lost after two goals from [[Ottmar Walter]].<ref>Dahlkamp, Hubert; Schulze-Marmeling, Dietrich (2006). 100 Jahre Preu\u00dfen M\u00fcnster.

The club made only a cameo appearance in the Bundesliga, being relegated after a next-to-last 15th-place finish.\n\n===Post Bundesliga play===\nPreu\u00dfen M\u00fcnster played out the 1960s and 1970s as a second division side in the Regionalliga West and 2. Bundesliga Nord. In the 1970s the Preu\u00dfen made several attempts to return to [[Bundesliga]]. Under club president G\u00fcnter Wellerdieck (from 1970 to 1978) the club took a considerable financial risk to achieve the promotion to first tier. Preu\u00dfen failed to do so by finishing on 5th place in the 1973\u201374 season and on 3rd place in the 1977\u201378 and 1978\u201379 seasons. After Wellerdieck and other staff of the club's management resigned due to financial difficulties and accusations of tax fraud in 1978, the decline of Preu\u00dfen M\u00fcnster continued.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Dahlkamp|first1=Hubert|last2=Schulze-Marmeling|first2=Dietrich|title=100 Jahre Preu\u00dfen M\u00fcnster|date=2006|publisher=Die Werkstatt GmbH|location=G\u00f6ttingen|isbn=978-3-89533-519-8|pages=129\u2013167}}</ref> They slipped to the Amateur Oberliga Westfalen (III) in the 1981\u201382 season, and except for a short adventure in the 2. Bundesliga in the 1990 and 1991 seasons, played third tier football in the Regionalliga West/Sudwest (1993\u20132000) and Regionalliga Nord until 2006. During this period, they captured the German Amateur Championship in 1994 with a 1\u20130 win over [[Kickers Offenbach]].\n\nIn 2006, the club was relegated to the [[Oberliga Westfalen]], now a fourth tier circuit. Management subsequently invested significant financial resources into a high-profile team of experienced second- and third-tier players in pursuit of immediate re-promotion. The attempt ended in failure and the club re-built itself with young players in place of expensive veterans and also put in place a young and relatively unknown coach, [[Roger Schmidt (football manager)|Roger Schmidt]]. The re-worked side finished in first place in the 2007\u201308 season, and so qualified for the new [[Regionalliga West]] which replaced the Oberliga in the league system. They ended the season in fourth place in the Regionalliga in 2008\u201309, and in sixth in 2009\u201310. For season 2008\u201309 the club qualified for the [[DFB-Pokal]] the first time since season 1997\u201398 (where they were defeated by [[1.FSV Mainz 05]]). The opponent was [[VfL Bochum]] which competed in [[Bundesliga]] at that time. After a penalty shootout Preu\u00dfen lost 5\u20136. In the following year the Eagles were defeated in the extra time against another first tier team, [[Hertha BSC]]. The match ended 1\u20133.\n\n[[File:SC Preu\u00dfen M\u00fcnster logo (2017).svg|thumb|175px|111-year anniversary logo used in 2017]]\nThey were finally promoted to [[3. Liga]] after finishing as champions of the West Group of the Regionalliga in the 2010\u201311 season. The manager of that time was [[Marc Fascher]]. Preu\u00dfen were defeated by another Bundesliga team in the German cup, [[VfL Wolfsburg]] (1\u20132). The first season 2011\u201312 in the third tier of German football after five years ended with a 12th place. In the following seasons the team finished significantly better and even had chances to get promoted again to [[2. Bundesliga]]. In season 2012\u201313 they almost succeeded and ended in fourth place. In that season the team was also able to defeat the Bundesliga team [[Werder Bremen]] in the first round of the DFB-Pokal, 4\u20132 after extra time. In the second round the club lost against [[FC Augsburg]]. In season 2013\u201314 they ended in sixth place. Again the club managed to win against a team from a higher league in the DFB-Pokal, [[FC St. Pauli]] from 2. Bundesliga. In the next round Preu\u00dfen was defeated again by FC Augsburg.\n\nIn the 2014\u201315 season, the club had a promising start, and was during winter even at the top of the league. Unfortunately the team was not able to keep up the good results and finished 8th. The season 2015\u201316 also started with good results, but again the team lost ground in the long turn and finished ninth. During the season the club switched managers, from [[Ralf Loose]] to Horst Steffen. The following season brought up big changes in the club administration. After changing the coach from Horst Steffen to the former SCP-player [[Benno M\u00f6hlmann]] several high ranking positions in the club were also manned with new personalities. To serve as chairman Preu\u00dfen M\u00fcnster could win over Christoph Str\u00e4sser, a former politician of the German [[Bundestag]]. Among others, the board of directors now contains Walther Seinsch who is well known in German football for his work with then fourth tier club [[FC Augsburg]]. Furthermore, with Friedrich Lucas the club's board now has a fans' representative for the first time in the history of Preu\u00dfen M\u00fcnster. In April 2017, Malte Metzelder manned the position of director of football. He is also a former player of the Eagles.\n\nIn 2017, Preu\u00dfen M\u00fcnster celebrated the club's 111th anniversary. In celebration, the club used a special anniversary logo in 2017. The logo contained the text \"111 Jahre\" (111 years) on top and \"1906\u20132017\" on the bottom, along with the club's usual [[Coat of arms of Prussia|Prussian eagle]] surrounded by a wreath. The club also gave away 111 [[litre]]s of free [[beer]] to fans at the stadium.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.wn.de/Sport/Lokalsport/Muenster/2017/04/2783349-Fussball-3.-Liga-Preussen-feiern-111.-Geburtstag-mit-Logo-Fruehstueck-und-Freibier |title=Fu\u00dfball: 3.

Once considered one of the most modern stadiums in Germany, the arena slowly fell into disrepair which resulted in reducing the capacity from 40,000 in the 1950s to the current 15,000. Construction of a new facility was considered in the 80s, but the idea was abandoned in December 2000. In spring 2008 it was decided to renovate, to make the stadium more attractive and fitting to modern standards. The seating area was replaced by a new one including 2,931 seats and VIP lounges. Some of the terraces which were still uncovered got a roof. The works finished in May 2009.\nFurther plans have been brought up to continue to modernize the stadium and actions were taken in 2014 to change the development plan of the stadium area by the local administration. Results are pending but in the end, the club wants to rebuild the western and eastern stand to give spectators more comfort and make the club more competitive financially. Furthermore, the Eagles want to extend training possibilities for the professional team and the junior teams.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.westline.de/fussball/sc-preussen-muenster/Muenster-macht-den-Weg-frei-fuer-dieses-Preussenstadion;art1991,2092845 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202154013/http://www.westline.de/fussball/sc-preussen-muenster/Muenster-macht-den-Weg-frei-fuer-dieses-Preussenstadion;art1991,2092845 |archive-date=2 February 2015 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\n==Fans==\n[[File:SC Preu\u00dfen M\u00fcnster Fans.JPG|thumb|Preu\u00dfen M\u00fcnster fans in 2006]]\nDue to the club's promotion from [[Regionalliga West]] to [[3.

During its years in fourth tier of the German league system, the average crowd never exceeded 4,500 fans, with the exception of the 2010\u201311 season, during which the club was promoted, with an average attendance of 5,628. In the following years the average crowd grew from 7,025 people in 2011\u201312 season to 8,986 people in season 2012\u201313. In season 2013\u201314 there was a decrease to 7,958 people.\n\nThe fans of M\u00fcnster have rivalries especially with supporters of [[Arminia Bielefeld]] and [[VfL Osnabr\u00fcck]]. The close proximity between the three cities which are located within a 65-kilometer radius led the press to the name of the Bermuda Triangle of M\u00fcnster, Osnabr\u00fcck and Bielefeld in [[3.

The football team currently plays in [[3. Liga]] which is the third tier in German football. Preu\u00dfen M\u00fcnster also fields teams in [[tennis]], [[Sport of athletics|athletics]], [[handball]] and [[fistball]].\n\n==History==\nThe club was founded as FC Preu\u00dfen on 30 April 1906 and has its roots in a group formed at the Johann-Conrad-Schlaun Grammar School. Historians consider patriotic reasons for naming the club after Prussia. At first the club did not have its own ground and was playing at a parade ground of the army at Loddenheide. General Baron von Bissing gave permission only if the goals would be taken down again after training. On 24 June 1907 the Eagles won their first game against FC Osnabr\u00fcck with 5\u20130. After successfully applying for the Western German League system, the team initially competed in the second tier. In 1908 the Eagles were promoted to the first league and in 1914 they won the Westphalian Championship. Between 1916 and 1926 the club played on M\u00fcnstermannplatz, which was close to the current ground, the [[Preu\u00dfenstadion]]. In 1921 they won the Championship a second time and also took on their current name.<ref>Dahlkamp, Hubert; Schulze-Marmeling, Dietrich (2006). 100 Jahre Preu\u00dfen M\u00fcnster.

They earned only mediocre results there and were relegated twice. Their second demotion in 1941 left them out of first division football until after World War II.\n[[File:Preussen Munster Performance Chart.png|260px|thumb|Historical chart of Preu\u00dfen M\u00fcnster league performance after WWII]]\n\nThe team played three seasons in the Landesliga Westfalen Gr. 2 (II) before returning to the top-flight in the [[Oberliga West]] in the 1948\u201349 season. That arrival was accompanied by some notoriety, as Preu\u00dfen M\u00fcnster became the first German football club to build a team by buying players, something previously unheard of in a country committed to the ideal of amateurism. Siegfried Rachuba, Adolf Preissler, Rudolf Schulz, [[Felix Gerritzen]], and Josef Lammers formed a front five dubbed by the press as the \"Hundred-Thousand-Mark Line\", even though that much money never did change hands. Rachuba is still M\u00fcnsters most successful first tier striker of all times with 97 goals in 238 games.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Dahlkamp|first1=Hubert|last2=Schulze-Marmeling|first2=Dietrich|title=100 Jahre Preu\u00dfen M\u00fcnster|date=2006|publisher=Die Werkstatt GmbH|location=G\u00f6ttingen|isbn=978-3-89533-519-8|pages=62\u201365}}</ref>\n\nThe investment paid dividends as the club appeared in the 1951 national final in front of 107,000 spectators at Berlin's Olympic Stadium against [[1. FC Kaiserslautern]]. Preu\u00dfen striker Gerritzen scored first but the team lost after two goals from [[Ottmar Walter]].<ref>Dahlkamp, Hubert; Schulze-Marmeling, Dietrich (2006). 100 Jahre Preu\u00dfen M\u00fcnster.

The club made only a cameo appearance in the Bundesliga, being relegated after a next-to-last 15th-place finish.\n\n===Post Bundesliga play===\nPreu\u00dfen M\u00fcnster played out the 1960s and 1970s as a second division side in the Regionalliga West and 2. Bundesliga Nord. In the 1970s the Preu\u00dfen made several attempts to return to [[Bundesliga]]. Under club president G\u00fcnter Wellerdieck (from 1970 to 1978) the club took a considerable financial risk to achieve the promotion to first tier. Preu\u00dfen failed to do so by finishing on 5th place in the 1973\u201374 season and on 3rd place in the 1977\u201378 and 1978\u201379 seasons. After Wellerdieck and other staff of the club's management resigned due to financial difficulties and accusations of tax fraud in 1978, the decline of Preu\u00dfen M\u00fcnster continued.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Dahlkamp|first1=Hubert|last2=Schulze-Marmeling|first2=Dietrich|title=100 Jahre Preu\u00dfen M\u00fcnster|date=2006|publisher=Die Werkstatt GmbH|location=G\u00f6ttingen|isbn=978-3-89533-519-8|pages=129\u2013167}}</ref> They slipped to the Amateur Oberliga Westfalen (III) in the 1981\u201382 season, and except for a short adventure in the 2. Bundesliga in the 1990 and 1991 seasons, played third tier football in the Regionalliga West/Sudwest (1993\u20132000) and Regionalliga Nord until 2006. During this period, they captured the German Amateur Championship in 1994 with a 1\u20130 win over [[Kickers Offenbach]].\n\nIn 2006, the club was relegated to the [[Oberliga Westfalen]], now a fourth tier circuit. Management subsequently invested significant financial resources into a high-profile team of experienced second- and third-tier players in pursuit of immediate re-promotion. The attempt ended in failure and the club re-built itself with young players in place of expensive veterans and also put in place a young and relatively unknown coach, [[Roger Schmidt (football manager)|Roger Schmidt]]. The re-worked side finished in first place in the 2007\u201308 season, and so qualified for the new [[Regionalliga West]] which replaced the Oberliga in the league system. They ended the season in fourth place in the Regionalliga in 2008\u201309, and in sixth in 2009\u201310. For season 2008\u201309 the club qualified for the [[DFB-Pokal]] the first time since season 1997\u201398 (where they were defeated by [[1.FSV Mainz 05]]). The opponent was [[VfL Bochum]] which competed in [[Bundesliga]] at that time. After a penalty shootout Preu\u00dfen lost 5\u20136. In the following year the Eagles were defeated in the extra time against another first tier team, [[Hertha BSC]]. The match ended 1\u20133.\n\n[[File:SC Preu\u00dfen M\u00fcnster logo (2017).svg|thumb|175px|111-year anniversary logo used in 2017]]\nThey were finally promoted to [[3. Liga]] after finishing as champions of the West Group of the Regionalliga in the 2010\u201311 season. The manager of that time was [[Marc Fascher]]. Preu\u00dfen were defeated by another Bundesliga team in the German cup, [[VfL Wolfsburg]] (1\u20132). The first season 2011\u201312 in the third tier of German football after five years ended with a 12th place. In the following seasons the team finished significantly better and even had chances to get promoted again to [[2. Bundesliga]]. In season 2012\u201313 they almost succeeded and ended in fourth place. In that season the team was also able to defeat the Bundesliga team [[Werder Bremen]] in the first round of the DFB-Pokal, 4\u20132 after extra time. In the second round the club lost against [[FC Augsburg]]. In season 2013\u201314 they ended in sixth place. Again the club managed to win against a team from a higher league in the DFB-Pokal, [[FC St. Pauli]] from 2. Bundesliga. In the next round Preu\u00dfen was defeated again by FC Augsburg.\n\nIn the 2014\u201315 season, the club had a promising start, and was during winter even at the top of the league. Unfortunately the team was not able to keep up the good results and finished 8th. The season 2015\u201316 also started with good results, but again the team lost ground in the long turn and finished ninth. During the season the club switched managers, from [[Ralf Loose]] to Horst Steffen. The following season brought up big changes in the club administration. After changing the coach from Horst Steffen to the former SCP-player [[Benno M\u00f6hlmann]] several high ranking positions in the club were also manned with new personalities. To serve as chairman Preu\u00dfen M\u00fcnster could win over Christoph Str\u00e4sser, a former politician of the German [[Bundestag]]. Among others, the board of directors now contains Walther Seinsch who is well known in German football for his work with then fourth tier club [[FC Augsburg]]. Furthermore, with Friedrich Lucas the club's board now has a fans' representative for the first time in the history of Preu\u00dfen M\u00fcnster. In April 2017, Malte Metzelder manned the position of director of football. He is also a former player of the Eagles.\n\nIn 2017, Preu\u00dfen M\u00fcnster celebrated the club's 111th anniversary. In celebration, the club used a special anniversary logo in 2017. The logo contained the text \"111 Jahre\" (111 years) on top and \"1906\u20132017\" on the bottom, along with the club's usual [[Coat of arms of Prussia|Prussian eagle]] surrounded by a wreath. The club also gave away 111 [[litre]]s of free [[beer]] to fans at the stadium.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.wn.de/Sport/Lokalsport/Muenster/2017/04/2783349-Fussball-3.-Liga-Preussen-feiern-111.-Geburtstag-mit-Logo-Fruehstueck-und-Freibier |title=Fu\u00dfball: 3.

Once considered one of the most modern stadiums in Germany, the arena slowly fell into disrepair which resulted in reducing the capacity from 40,000 in the 1950s to the current 15,000. Construction of a new facility was considered in the 80s, but the idea was abandoned in December 2000. In spring 2008 it was decided to renovate, to make the stadium more attractive and fitting to modern standards. The seating area was replaced by a new one including 2,931 seats and VIP lounges. Some of the terraces which were still uncovered got a roof. The works finished in May 2009.\nFurther plans have been brought up to continue to modernize the stadium and actions were taken in 2014 to change the development plan of the stadium area by the local administration. Results are pending but in the end, the club wants to rebuild the western and eastern stand to give spectators more comfort and make the club more competitive financially. Furthermore, the Eagles want to extend training possibilities for the professional team and the junior teams.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.westline.de/fussball/sc-preussen-muenster/Muenster-macht-den-Weg-frei-fuer-dieses-Preussenstadion;art1991,2092845 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202154013/http://www.westline.de/fussball/sc-preussen-muenster/Muenster-macht-den-Weg-frei-fuer-dieses-Preussenstadion;art1991,2092845 |archive-date=2 February 2015 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\n==Fans==\n[[File:SC Preu\u00dfen M\u00fcnster Fans.JPG|thumb|Preu\u00dfen M\u00fcnster fans in 2006]]\nDue to the club's promotion from [[Regionalliga West]] to [[3. Liga]], average attendance significantly. During its years in fourth tier of the German league system, the average crowd never exceeded 4,500 fans, with the exception of the 2010\u201311 season, during which the club was promoted, with an average attendance of 5,628. In the following years the average crowd grew from 7,025 people in 2011\u201312 season to 8,986 people in season 2012\u201313. In season 2013\u201314 there was a decrease to 7,958 people.\n\nThe fans of M\u00fcnster have rivalries especially with supporters of [[Arminia Bielefeld]] and [[VfL Osnabr\u00fcck]]. The close proximity between the three cities which are located within a 65-kilometer radius led the press to the name of the Bermuda Triangle of M\u00fcnster, Osnabr\u00fcck and Bielefeld in [[3. Liga]].<ref>http://www.wn.de/Lokalsport/Preussen-Muenster/1807187-Das-Bermudadreieck-in-Liga-drei-Muenster-nervenstark-und-stabil</ref> Another minor rival of Preu\u00dfen M\u00fcnster supporters is [[Rot Weiss Essen]].\n\nPreu\u00dfen M\u00fcnster has currently 1980 members (''in December 2014'').<ref>http://www.wn.de/Lokalsport/Preussen-Muenster/1814356-Jahreshauptversammung-des-SC-Preussen-Auf-die-Spitze-getrieben</ref>\nPart of the club is the ''Fanprojekt Preu\u00dfen M\u00fcnster e. V.'' which serves as a voice for supporters to club management. It also arranges bus tours to matches and events to support charity organizations in the M\u00fcnster-area. Furthermore, the Fanprojekt offers a radio during matches for people not present, ''Radio Mottekstrehle''.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n*{{Official website}}\n*[http://www.abseits-soccer.com/clubs/muenster.html The Abseits Guide to German Soccer]\n*[http://preussenfieber.com Blog and Database about Preu\u00dfen M\u00fcnster]\n*[http://forum.westline.de/viewforum.php?f=14 Supporters Forum]\n\n{{SC Preu\u00dfen M\u00fcnster}}\n{{3.

In late January 2013, Branagh signed on to direct, with Weitz hired to revise a script from [[Aline Brosh McKenna]]. In November 2012, casting began with Blanchett being the first to sign on; James was eventually cast in the titular role in April 2013. [[Principal photography]] began at [[Pinewood Studios]] in [[Buckinghamshire, England]] on September 23, 2013, and ended on December 14.\n\n''Cinderella'' had its world premiere on February 13, 2015, at the [[65th Berlin International Film Festival]] and was released theatrically in the United States on March 13, 2015, and in the United Kingdom on March 27 in standard and [[IMAX]] formats by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]]. It grossed over $542&nbsp;million worldwide, becoming Branagh's highest-grossing film to date as a director. The film received generally  positive reviews from critics, with many praising the performances (particularly James, Blanchett, and Bonham Carter), Branagh's direction, musical score, costume design, production values, and faithfulness to the original animated film. It received a nomination at the [[88th Academy Awards]], [[21st Critics' Choice Awards]] and [[69th British Academy Film Awards]], all for costume design. \n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\nElla and her parents live a humble but happy life until her mother falls ill. Ella promises to follow her mother's dying wish: to have courage and be kind. Years later, Ella's father marries Lady Tremaine, who has two unpleasant daughters, Drisella and Anastasia. Ella's father leaves on business, and Lady Tremaine reveals her cruel and jealous nature, pushing Ella to give up her bedroom to the stepsisters and move to the attic. When Ella's father unexpectedly dies, Lady Tremaine dismisses the household staff to save money and forces all their chores on Ella. Seeing Ella's face covered in [[cinders]] after sleeping by the fireplace, her step-family mockingly dubs her \"Cinderella\".\n\nDistraught, Ella rides off into the woods where she happens to encounter Kit, the [[crown prince]], hunting. He hides that he is a prince and instead introduces himself as a palace apprentice. Ella and Kit take a liking to each other, but they part without him learning her name. The King discovers he has little time left to live, and urges Kit to take a princess as his bride at the upcoming royal ball. Kit persuades his father to also invite every eligible maiden in the kingdom, hoping to see Ella again.\n\nOn the night of the ball, Ella tries to join her step-family, wearing her mother\u2019s old gown that she has refashioned, but Lady Tremaine and Drisella tear it to shreds and leave without her. Ella runs into the garden in tears and meets an old beggar woman, who reveals herself to be Ella's Fairy Godmother. She magically transforms a pumpkin into a carriage, mice into horses, lizards into footmen, and a goose into the coachman. She then transforms Ella's ripped gown into a beautiful ballgown, complete with a pair of glass slippers. As Ella departs, the Fairy Godmother warns her the spell will end at the last stroke of midnight, and casts a final spell to prevent Ella's stepfamily from recognizing her.\n\nAt the ball, the entire court is entranced by Ella. She dances with Kit, much to the chagrin of the Grand Duke who has already promised Kit to Princess Chelina of Zaragoza, which Lady Tremaine overhears. Though surprised at Kit's true identity, Ella and the prince bond. Before Ella can tell Kit her name, the clock chimes midnight and she flees the palace, losing one of her slippers. Pursued by the Grand Duke and his men, Ella manages to escape home before the final stroke of midnight; the spell dissipates and everything reverts back to its true form. Ella hides the remaining slipper under her bedroom floorboards.\n\nThe King dies, but not before giving his son permission to marry Ella. Now King, Kit issues a royal proclamation professing his love for the \u201cmystery princess\u201d and requests she present herself. Ella hurries to retrieve the glass slipper to prove her identity, only to find it with her stepmother. Having deduced that Ella is the mystery princess, Lady Tremaine attempts to blackmail Ella to make her head of the royal household and find respectable husbands for her stepsisters, in exchange for giving Ella's hand in marriage to Kit. Ella refuses, and Lady Tremaine smashes the slipper and locks Ella in the attic. She brings the shattered remains of the slipper to the Grand Duke, who agrees to make her a [[countess]] and secure marriages for her daughters in exchange for keeping Ella hidden.\n\nThe Grand Duke and the Captain of the guards lead the search for the mystery princess by trying the slipper on every woman in the kingdom, but it refuses to fit anyone. At the Tremaine estate, the shoe fits neither stepsister; the company prepares to depart, but hear Ella singing ''[[Lavender's Blue]]''. The Grand Duke urges them to leave, but Kit, who has secretly accompanied them, commands the Captain to investigate. The slipper fits Ella, and she and Kit promise to accept one another for who they truly are. As they leave, Ella forgives her stepmother. Soon after, Lady Tremaine, her daughters, and the Grand Duke leave the kingdom, never to return.\n\nElla and Kit marry and become the kingdom's most beloved monarchs, ruling with the same courage and kindness that Ella had promised her mother, and live happily ever after.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- As shown in the credits, some names differ in dialogue. -->\n\n* [[Cate Blanchett]] as [[Lady

Powell said she was aiming for the look of \"a nineteenth-century period film made in the 1940s or 1950s.\"<ref name=\"vanityfair.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/02/cinderella-wedding-gown-first-look|title=First Look: The Making of Cinderella's Wedding Gown|last=Chi|first=Paul|website=Vanity Fair|date=February 11, 2015|accessdate=March 12, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Vogue\" />\n\nFor the Fairy Godmother, Powell took a major departure from the animated film of the 1950s, instead giving actress [[Helena Bonham Carter]] an opulent white ballgown, featuring fairy wings, puff sleeves and a very full skirt. The skirt also had battery lights underneath it, which Helena said caused issues when filming scenes as the batteries would run low quite quickly.\nFor the stepmother and stepsisters, Powell had a very clear idea about the look; \"They are meant to be totally ridiculous on the outside\u2014a bit too much and overdone\u2014and ugly on the inside.\"<ref name=\"Vogue\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vogue.com/4463911/cinderella-movie-2015-sandy-powell-costume-designer/|title=What Would Cinderella Wear? Costuming Lily James and Cate Blanchett in Kenneth Branagh's Forthcoming Film|date=November 19, 2014|first=Leslie|last=Camhi|website=Vogue|accessdate=March 12, 2015}}</ref> The silhouette of the prince came from the original animation, however she created a more fitted look and less masculine colors. Some of the prince costumes were dyed to accentuate Madden's eyes.<ref name=\"vanityfair.com\" />\n\nThe ball gown was inspired by the Disney animated film in its color and shape; \"The gown had to look lovely when she dances and runs away from the ball. I wanted her to look like she was floating, like a watercolor painting.\"<ref name=\"vanityfair.com\" /> The dress was made with more than a dozen fine layers of fabric, a corset and a petticoat. Nine versions of the Cinderella gown were designed, each with more than 270 yards of fabric and 10,000 crystals. It took 18 tailors and 500 hours to make each dress.<ref name=\"vanityfair.com\" />\n\nThe wedding dress was another difficult project. \"Creating the wedding dress was a challenge. Rather than try to make something even better than the ball gown, I had to do something completely different and simple... I wanted the whole effect to be ephemeral and fine, so we went with an extreme-lined shaped bodice with a long train\", said Powell. It took 16 people and 550 hours to complete the silk-organza, hand painted dress. While the crew photographed James in the gown, the actress stood too close to an electric heater and the dress caught on fire; the top layer of the dress had to be redone because only one wedding dress was created due to time and budget constraints.<ref name=\"vanityfair.com\" />\n\nFor the glass slipper, Powell took inspiration from a 1950s shoe she saw in a museum. Since glass does not sparkle, they decided to use crystal instead. [[Swarovski]] partnered with Disney to make the famous shoe. Powell went directly to Swarovski headquarters in [[Austria]] to meet the product developers. It took 6 digital renderings of the shoes until they found the right one for the film. Swarovski made eight pairs of crystal shoes for the film, though none were actually wearable. Consequently, the leather shoes James wore on set had to be digitally altered into crystal. Alongside the slipper, Swarovski provided more than 7&nbsp;million crystals that were used in costumes and 100 tiaras for the ball scene.<ref>{{cite

The film is based on the [[Cinderella|eponymous folk tale]] and is a [[live action]] adaptation of [[Walt Disney]]'s [[Cinderella (1950 film)|1950 animated film of the same name]].<ref name=PressKit>{{cite web|title=Cinderella: Press Release|url=http://www.wdsmediafile.com/media/Cinderella/writen-material/Cinderella54dc0b6c538d2.pdf|website=The Walt Disney Company|publisher=The Walt Disney Studios|accessdate=February 13, 2015}}</ref> It features [[Lily James]] as the [[Cinderella (Disney character)|eponymous character]], with [[Cate Blanchett]], [[Richard Madden]], [[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]], [[Holliday Grainger]], [[Derek Jacobi]], and [[Helena Bonham Carter]].\n\nDevelopment for a [[List of Disney live-action remakes of animated films|live-action reimagining]] of the original animated film began in May 2010, with producer [[Simon Kinberg]] attached to the project. In late January 2013, Branagh signed on to direct, with Weitz hired to revise a script from [[Aline Brosh McKenna]]. In November 2012, casting began with Blanchett being the first to sign on; James was eventually cast in the titular role in April 2013. [[Principal photography]] began at [[Pinewood Studios]] in [[Buckinghamshire, England]] on September 23, 2013, and ended on December 14.\n\n''Cinderella'' had its world premiere on February 13, 2015, at the [[65th Berlin International Film Festival]] and was released theatrically in the United States on March 13, 2015, and in the United Kingdom on March 27 in standard and [[IMAX]] formats by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]]. It grossed over $542&nbsp;million worldwide, becoming Branagh's highest-grossing film to date as a director. The film received generally  positive reviews from critics, with many praising the performances (particularly James, Blanchett, and Bonham Carter), Branagh's direction, musical score, costume design, production values, and faithfulness to the original animated film. It received a nomination at the [[88th Academy Awards]], [[21st Critics' Choice Awards]] and [[69th British Academy Film Awards]], all for costume design. \n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\nElla and her parents live a humble but happy life until her mother falls ill. Ella promises to follow her mother's dying wish: to have courage and be kind. Years later, Ella's father marries Lady Tremaine, who has two unpleasant daughters, Drisella and Anastasia. Ella's father leaves on business, and Lady Tremaine reveals her cruel and jealous nature, pushing Ella to give up her bedroom to the stepsisters and move to the attic. When Ella's father unexpectedly dies, Lady Tremaine dismisses the household staff to save money and forces all their chores on Ella. Seeing Ella's face covered in [[cinders]] after sleeping by the fireplace, her step-family mockingly dubs her \"Cinderella\".\n\nDistraught, Ella rides off into the woods where she happens to encounter Kit, the [[crown prince]], hunting. He hides that he is a prince and instead introduces himself as a palace apprentice. Ella and Kit take a liking to each other, but they part without him learning her name. The King discovers he has little time left to live, and urges Kit to take a princess as his bride at the upcoming royal ball. Kit persuades his father to also invite every eligible maiden in the kingdom, hoping to see Ella again.\n\nOn the night of the ball, Ella tries to join her step-family, wearing her mother\u2019s old gown that she has refashioned, but Lady Tremaine and Drisella tear it to shreds and leave without her. Ella runs into the garden in tears and meets an old beggar woman, who reveals herself to be Ella's Fairy Godmother. She magically transforms a pumpkin into a carriage, mice into horses, lizards into footmen, and a goose into the coachman. She then transforms Ella's ripped gown into a beautiful ballgown, complete with a pair of glass slippers. As Ella departs, the Fairy Godmother warns her the spell will end at the last stroke of midnight, and casts a final spell to prevent Ella's stepfamily from recognizing her.\n\nAt the ball, the entire court is entranced by Ella. She dances with Kit, much to the chagrin of the Grand Duke who has already promised Kit to Princess Chelina of Zaragoza, which Lady Tremaine overhears. Though surprised at Kit's true identity, Ella and the prince bond. Before Ella can tell Kit her name, the clock chimes midnight and she flees the palace, losing one of her slippers. Pursued by the Grand Duke and his men, Ella manages to escape home before the final stroke of midnight; the spell dissipates and everything reverts back to its true form. Ella hides the remaining slipper under her bedroom floorboards.\n\nThe King dies, but not before giving his son permission to marry Ella. Now King, Kit issues a royal proclamation professing his love for the \u201cmystery princess\u201d and requests she present herself. Ella hurries to retrieve the glass slipper to prove her identity, only to find it with her stepmother. Having deduced that Ella is the mystery princess, Lady Tremaine attempts to blackmail Ella to make her head of the royal household and find respectable husbands for her stepsisters, in exchange for giving Ella's hand in marriage to Kit. Ella refuses, and Lady Tremaine smashes the slipper and locks Ella in the attic. She brings the shattered remains of the slipper to the Grand Duke, who agrees to make her a [[countess]] and secure marriages for her daughters in exchange for keeping Ella hidden.\n\nThe Grand Duke and the Captain of the guards lead the search for the mystery princess by trying the slipper on every woman in the kingdom, but it refuses to fit anyone. At the Tremaine estate, the shoe fits neither stepsister; the company prepares to depart, but hear Ella singing ''[[Lavender's Blue]]''. The Grand Duke urges them to leave, but Kit, who has secretly accompanied them, commands the Captain to investigate. The slipper fits Ella, and she and Kit promise to accept one another for who they truly are. As they leave, Ella forgives her stepmother. Soon after, Lady Tremaine, her daughters, and the Grand Duke leave the kingdom, never to return.\n\nElla and Kit marry and become the kingdom's most beloved monarchs, ruling with the same courage and kindness that Ella had promised her mother, and live happily ever after.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- As shown in the credits, some names differ in dialogue. -->\n\n* [[Cate Blanchett]] as [[Lady

Pictures president of production [[Sean Bailey]], studio chairman [[Alan F.

Powell began working on concepts for the characters' looks almost two years before principal photography began in the summer of 2013. Powell said she was aiming for the look of \"a nineteenth-century period film made in the 1940s or 1950s.\"<ref name=\"vanityfair.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/02/cinderella-wedding-gown-first-look|title=First Look: The Making of Cinderella's Wedding Gown|last=Chi|first=Paul|website=Vanity Fair|date=February 11, 2015|accessdate=March 12, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Vogue\" />\n\nFor the Fairy Godmother, Powell took a major departure from the animated film of the 1950s, instead giving actress [[Helena Bonham Carter]] an opulent white ballgown, featuring fairy wings, puff sleeves and a very full skirt. The skirt also had battery lights underneath it, which Helena said caused issues when filming scenes as the batteries would run low quite quickly.\nFor the stepmother and stepsisters, Powell had a very clear idea about the look; \"They are meant to be totally ridiculous on the outside\u2014a bit too much and overdone\u2014and ugly on the inside.\"<ref name=\"Vogue\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vogue.com/4463911/cinderella-movie-2015-sandy-powell-costume-designer/|title=What Would Cinderella Wear? Costuming Lily James and Cate Blanchett in Kenneth Branagh's Forthcoming Film|date=November 19, 2014|first=Leslie|last=Camhi|website=Vogue|accessdate=March 12, 2015}}</ref> The silhouette of the prince came from the original animation, however she created a more fitted look and less masculine colors. Some of the prince costumes were dyed to accentuate Madden's eyes.<ref name=\"vanityfair.com\" />\n\nThe ball gown was inspired by the Disney animated film in its color and shape; \"The gown had to look lovely when she dances and runs away from the ball. I wanted her to look like she was floating, like a watercolor painting.\"<ref name=\"vanityfair.com\" /> The dress was made with more than a dozen fine layers of fabric, a corset and a petticoat. Nine versions of the Cinderella gown were designed, each with more than 270 yards of fabric and 10,000 crystals. It took 18 tailors and 500 hours to make each dress.<ref name=\"vanityfair.com\" />\n\nThe wedding dress was another difficult project. \"Creating the wedding dress was a challenge. Rather than try to make something even better than the ball gown, I had to do something completely different and simple... I wanted the whole effect to be ephemeral and fine, so we went with an extreme-lined shaped bodice with a long train\", said Powell. It took 16 people and 550 hours to complete the silk-organza, hand painted dress. While the crew photographed James in the gown, the actress stood too close to an electric heater and the dress caught on fire; the top layer of the dress had to be redone because only one wedding dress was created due to time and budget constraints.<ref name=\"vanityfair.com\" />\n\nFor the glass slipper, Powell took inspiration from a 1950s shoe she saw in a museum. Since glass does not sparkle, they decided to use crystal instead. [[Swarovski]] partnered with Disney to make the famous shoe. Powell went directly to Swarovski headquarters in [[Austria]] to meet the product developers. It took 6 digital renderings of the shoes until they found the right one for the film. Swarovski made eight pairs of crystal shoes for the film, though none were actually wearable. Consequently, the leather shoes James wore on set had to be digitally altered into crystal. Alongside the slipper, Swarovski provided more than 7&nbsp;million crystals that were used in costumes and 100 tiaras for the ball scene.<ref>{{cite

The plan called for two of the first-stage engines to shut down to reduce the rocket's acceleration at approximately 2 minutes 30 seconds into the flight when the Falcon 9 would nominally be {{convert|90|km|mi}} high and traveling at 10 times the speed of sound. The remaining engines were planned to cut off shortly after\u2014an event known as main-engine cutoff (MECO). Five seconds after MECO, the first and second stages separate. Seven seconds later, the second stage's single Merlin vacuum engine was projected to ignite to begin a 6-minute, 14-second burn to put Dragon into [[low-Earth orbit]]. Forty seconds after second-stage ignition, Dragon's protective nose cone, which covers Dragon's berthing mechanism, was planned to be jettisoned. At the 9-minute, 14-second mark after launch, the second-stage engine was scheduled to cut off (SECO). Thirty-five seconds later, Dragon was planned to separate from Falcon 9's second stage and reach its preliminary orbit. The dragon would, per plan, then deploy its solar arrays and open its guidance and navigation control (GNC) bay door which holds the sensors necessary for rendezvous and Dragon's [[Power Data Grapple Fixture|grapple fixture]].<ref name=\"Presskit\"/>\n\n=== Flight day 2 (9 October) ===\nThe mission plan called for the Dragon spacecraft to perform a coelliptic burn that would place it in a circular [[coelliptic orbit]].<ref name=\"Presskit\"/>\n\n=== Flight day 3 (10 October) ===\nAs Dragon chased the [[International Space Station]], the spacecraft established UHF communication using its COTS Ultra-high-frequency Communication Unit (CUCU). Also, using the crew command panel (CCP) onboard the station, the expedition crew monitored the approach. This ability for the crew to send commands to Dragon is important during the rendezvous and departure phases of the mission.<ref name=\"Presskit\"/>\n\nDuring the final approach to the station, a go/no-go was performed by [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center#FCR 1 (2006-present)|Mission Control Houston]] and the SpaceX team in Hawthorne to allow Dragon to perform another engine burn that brought it {{convert|250|m|ft}} from the station. At this distance, Dragon began using its close-range guidance systems, composed of [[LIDAR]] and thermal imagers. These systems confirmed that Dragon's position and velocity are accurate by comparing the LIDAR image that Dragon receives against Dragon's thermal imagers. The Dragon flight control team in Hawthorne, with assistance from the NASA flight control team at the Johnson Space Center's International Space Station Flight Control Room, commanded the spacecraft to approach the station from its hold position. After another go/no-go was performed by the Houston and Hawthorne teams, Dragon was permitted to enter the Keep-Out Sphere (KOS), an imaginary sphere drawn {{convert|200|m|ft}} around the station that reduces the risk of collision. Dragon proceeded to a position {{convert|30|m|ft}} from the station and was automatically held. Another go/no-go was completed. Then Dragon proceeded to the {{convert|10|m|ft}} position \u2014 the capture point. A final go/no-go was performed, and the Mission Control Houston team notified the crew they were going for the capture of Dragon.<ref name=\"Presskit\"/>\n\nAt that point, Expedition 33 crewmember [[Akihiko Hoshide]] of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency used the station's {{convert|17.6|m|ft}} robotic arm, known as [[Mobile Servicing System#Canadarm2 |Canadarm2]], reached for and grappled the Dragon spacecraft at 10:56 UTC.<ref name=SPACENOW10/> Hoshide, with the help of Expedition 33 Commander [[Sunita Williams]] of NASA, guided Dragon to the Earth-facing side of the station's [[Harmony module]]. Williams and Hoshide swapped places and Williams gently berthed Dragon to Harmony's [[Common Berthing Mechanism]] at 13:03 UTC.<ref name=SPACENOW10/>\n\nThe opening of the hatch between Dragon and the Harmony module, which was originally not scheduled to occur until 11 October, was moved up and occurred at 17:40 UTC.<ref name=SPACENOW10/>\n\n=== Remainder of mission (11 to 28 October) ===\n[[File:SpX CRS-1 berthed - cropped.jpg|thumb|right|A Dragon as seen from [[Cupola (ISS module)|Cupola]] on 14 October 2012.]]\n\nOver a period of two and a half weeks, the ISS crew unloaded Dragon's payload and reloaded it with cargo for return to Earth.<ref name=\"Presskit\"/>{{Failed verification|date=November 2012}}<!-- a source from before the flight does not confirm that the planned event became a past-tense historical fact; needs a better source, or the prose needs to speak to the mission plan as outlined in the presskit -->\n\nAfter its mission at the orbital laboratory was completed, newly arrived Expedition 33 Flight Engineer [[Kevin A. Ford|Kevin Ford]] used the Canadarm2 robotic arm to detach Dragon from Harmony, maneuver it out to the 15-meter (50-foot) release point, and release the vehicle. The Dragon then performed a series of three burns to place it on a trajectory away from the station. Approximately six hours after Dragon departed the station, it conducted a deorbit burn, which lasted up to 10 minutes. Dragon's trunk, which contains its solar arrays, was then jettisoned.<ref name=\"Presskit\"/>{{Failed verification|date=November 2012}}<!-- a source from before the flight does not confirm that the planned event became a past-tense historical fact; needs a better source, or the prose needs to speak to the mission plan as outlined in the presskit -->\n\n[[File:SpX-1 Dragon at port.1.jpg|thumb|left|The SpX-1 capsule seen back at a port on 30 October 2012.]]\n\nThe landing was controlled by automatic firing of its [[Draco (rocket engine family)#Draco|Draco]] thrusters during [[Atmospheric entry|reentry]].{{Failed verification|date=November 2012}}<!-- a source from before the flight does not confirm that the planned event became a past-tense historical fact; needs a better source, or the prose needs to speak to the mission plan as outlined in the presskit --> In a carefully timed sequence of events, dual [[drogue parachute]]s deploy at an altitude of {{convert|13700|m|ft|abbr=on}} to stabilize and slow the spacecraft. Full deployment of the drogues triggers the release of the three main parachutes, each 35 meters (116 feet) in diameter, at about {{convert|3000|m|ft|abbr=on}}. While the drogues detach from the spacecraft, the main parachutes further slow the spacecraft's descent to approximately {{convert|4.8|to|5.4|m/s|ft/s|sp=us}}. Even if Dragon were to lose one of its main parachutes, the two remaining chutes would still permit a safe landing. The Dragon capsule is expected to land in the Pacific Ocean, about {{convert|450|km|mi|abbr=on}} off the coast of southern California. SpaceX uses a 100-foot boat equipped with an A-frame and an articulating crane, a 90-foot crew boat for telemetry operations, and two 24-foot rigid-hull inflatable boats to perform recovery operations. On board are approximately a dozen SpaceX engineers and technicians as well as a four-person dive team. Once the Dragon capsule splashed down, the recovery team secured the vehicle and then placed it on deck for the journey back to shore.{{Failed verification|date=November 2012}}<!-- a source from before the flight does not confirm that the planned event became a past-tense historical fact; needs a better source, or the prose needs to speak to the mission plan as outlined in the presskit --><ref name=\"Presskit\"/>\n\nSpaceX technicians opened the side hatch of the vehicle and retrieved the time-critical items. The critical cargo items were placed on a fast-boat for the 450-Kilometer trip back to California for eventual return to NASA that then took care of the precious science cargo and handle post-flight analysis of the samples.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spaceflight101.com/dragon-crs-1-mission-updates.html |title=Dragon CRS-1 Mission Updates |publisher=SPACEFLIGHT101 |accessdate=8 October 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130212070813/http://www.spaceflight101.com/dragon-crs-1-mission-updates.html |archivedate=12 February 2013  }}</ref> The rest of the cargo was unloaded once the Dragon capsule reached SpaceX's test facility in McGregor, Texas.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/falcon9/004/121028splashdown/ |title=Dragon Mission Report &#124; Return of the Dragon: Commercial craft back home |publisher=Spaceflight Now |date= |accessdate=8 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Payload ==\n[[File:CRS SpX-1 Dragon int.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The Dragon spacecraft being integrated onto Falcon 9 on 30 September 2012]]\n\n=== Primary payload ===\nWhen launched the CRS-1 Dragon was filled with about {{convert|1995|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of cargo, {{convert|882|lb|kg|abbr=on}} without packaging.<ref name=Presskit/> Included was {{convert|260|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of crew supplies, {{convert|390|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of critical materials to support the 166 experiments on board the station and 66 new experiments, as well as {{convert|232|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of hardware for the station as well as other miscellaneous items.<ref name=Presskit/>\n\nThe Dragon returned {{convert|1995|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of cargo, {{convert|1673|lb|kg|abbr=on}} without packaging.<ref name=Presskit/> Included was {{convert|163|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of crew supplies, {{convert|866|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of scientific experiments and experiment hardware, {{convert|518|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of space station hardware, {{convert|68|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of [[spacesuit]] equipment and {{convert|55|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of miscellaneous items.<ref name=Presskit/>\n\n=== Secondary payload ===\nFor some months prior to the launch, a {{convert|150|kg|lb|abbr=on}} prototype second-generation [[Orbcomm (satellite)|Orbcomm satellite]] was planned to be launched as a [[secondary payload]] from Falcon 9's second stage.<ref name=\"Orbcomm 25 May 2012\" /><ref name=\"Hartman 23 July 2012\" />\n\nAlthough the secondary payload made it to the Dragon insertion orbit, an engine anomaly on one of the nine engines on the Falcon 9 first stage during the ascent resulted in automatic engine shutdown and a longer first-stage burn on the remaining eight engines to complete orbital insertion while subsequently increasing use of propellant over the nominal mission.\n\nThe primary payload contractor, NASA, requires a greater-than-99% estimated probability that the stage of any secondary payload on a similar orbital inclination to the [[International Space Station]] will reach their orbital altitude goal above the station.

It is important to appreciate that Orbcomm understood from the beginning that the orbit-raising maneuver was tentative.

During flight, the data suggests this material flaw ultimately developed into a breach in the main combustion chamber. This breach released a jet of hot gas and fuel in the direction of the main fuel line causing a secondary leak and ultimately a rapid drop in engine pressure. As a result, the flight computer commanded shutdown of engine 1 and Falcon 9 continued on its path to ensure Dragon's entry into orbit for subsequent rendezvous and berthing with the ISS.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://aviationweek.com/blog/spacex-engine-anomaly-overview |title=SpaceX: Engine Anomaly Overview |publisher=Aviationweek.com |date= |accessdate=8 October 2013}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Spaceflight}}\n* [[List of Falcon 9 launches]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist |colwidth=30em |refs=\n\n<ref name=HARTMAN>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/672214main_1-Hartman_July12_NAC_Final_508.pdf |title=International Space Station Program Status |last=Hartman |first=Dan |date=23 July 2012 |publisher=NASA |accessdate=18 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Presskit\">\n{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/694166main_SpaceXCRS-1PressKit.pdf |title=SpX CRS-1 Mission Press Kit |date=4 October 2012 |publisher=NASA, SpaceX, 45th Space Wing |accessdate=6 October 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"SpaceX Launch Manifest\">\n{{cite web |title=SpaceX Launch Manifest |publisher=SpaceX |url=http://www.spacex.com/launch_manifest.php |accessdate=31 May 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"NASA Launch Schedule\">\n{{cite web |title=NASA's Consolidated Launch Schedule |publisher=NASA |url=http://www.nasa.gov/missions/highlights/schedule.html |accessdate=21 June 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"NASAsept20\">\n{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/spacex-crs1-target.html |title=SpaceX, NASA Target Oct. 7 Launch For Resupply Mission To Space Station |date=20 September 2012 |publisher=NASA |accessdate=26 September 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Clark 18 May 2012\">\n{{cite web |last=Clark |first=Stephen |date=18 May 2012 |title=SpaceX's historic commercial mission is 'just a test flight' |publisher=SpaceFlightNow |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/falcon9/003/120518commercial/ |accessdate=25 August 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=ClarkOct28>{{cite web |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/falcon9/004/121028splashdown/#.UI_fCIa_PKg |title=Return of the Dragon: Commercial craft back home |last=Clark |first=Stephen |date=28 October 2012 |publisher=SpaceFlightNow |accessdate=30 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Clark 24 August 2012\">\n{{cite web |title=NASA ready for operational cargo flights by SpaceX |last=Clark |first=Stephen |date=24 August 2012 |publisher=SpaceFlightNow |url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n1208/24cots/ |accessdate=25 August 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=SPACENOW10>{{cite web |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/falcon9/004/121010arrival/ |title=Dragon arrives at station with commercial delivery |last=Clark |first=Stephen |date=10 October 2012 |publisher=SpaceFlightNow |accessdate=18 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Orbcomm 25 May 2012\">\n{{cite press |title=Orbcomm Eagerly Awaits Launch of New Satellite on Next Falcon 9 |date=25 May 2012 |publisher=Space News |url=http://www.spacenews.com/satellite_telecom/120525-spacex-success-welcome-orbcomm.html |accessdate=28 May 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Hartman 23 July 2012\">\n{{cite web |last=Hartman |first=Dan |date=23 July 2012 |title=International Space Station Program Status |publisher=NASA |url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/672214main_1-Hartman_July12_NAC_Final_508.pdf |accessdate=28 August 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Sept29\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2012/09/falcon-9-hot-fires-engines-iss-prepares-dragons-arrival/ |title=Falcon 9 hot fires its engines as the ISS prepares for Dragon's arrival |last=Bergin |first=Chris |date=29 September 2012 |publisher=NASASpaceFlight (not associated with NASA) |accessdate=29 September 2012}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"AugustChris\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2012/08/spacex-conduct-successful-wdr-falcon-9/ |title=SpaceX conduct successful WDR on their latest Falcon 9 |last=Bergin |first=Chris |date=31 August 2012 |publisher=NASASpaceFlight (not associated with NASA) |accessdate=1 September 2012}}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|SpaceX CRS-1}}\n*[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/living/launch/index.html SpaceX CRS-1 NASA page]\n*[http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/694166main_SpaceXCRS-1PressKit.pdf SpaceX CRS-1 Mission Press Kit (4 October 2012)]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I7loLnDYyU Video of Static Fire test -

The plan called for two of the first-stage engines to shut down to reduce the rocket's acceleration at approximately 2 minutes 30 seconds into the flight when the Falcon 9 would nominally be {{convert|90|km|mi}} high and traveling at 10 times the speed of sound. The remaining engines were planned to cut off shortly after\u2014an event known as main-engine cutoff (MECO). Five seconds after MECO, the first and second stages separate. Seven seconds later, the second stage's single Merlin vacuum engine was projected to ignite to begin a 6-minute, 14-second burn to put Dragon into [[low-Earth orbit]]. Forty seconds after second-stage ignition, Dragon's protective nose cone, which covers Dragon's berthing mechanism, was planned to be jettisoned. At the 9-minute, 14-second mark after launch, the second-stage engine was scheduled to cut off (SECO). Thirty-five seconds later, Dragon was planned to separate from Falcon 9's second stage and reach its preliminary orbit. The dragon would, per plan, then deploy its solar arrays and open its guidance and navigation control (GNC) bay door which holds the sensors necessary for rendezvous and Dragon's [[Power Data Grapple Fixture|grapple fixture]].<ref name=\"Presskit\"/>\n\n=== Flight day 2 (9 October) ===\nThe mission plan called for the Dragon spacecraft to perform a coelliptic burn that would place it in a circular [[coelliptic orbit]].<ref name=\"Presskit\"/>\n\n=== Flight day 3 (10 October) ===\nAs Dragon chased the [[International Space Station]], the spacecraft established UHF communication using its COTS Ultra-high-frequency Communication Unit (CUCU). Also, using the crew command panel (CCP) onboard the station, the expedition crew monitored the approach. This ability for the crew to send commands to Dragon is important during the rendezvous and departure phases of the mission.<ref name=\"Presskit\"/>\n\nDuring the final approach to the station, a go/no-go was performed by [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center#FCR 1 (2006-present)|Mission Control Houston]] and the SpaceX team in Hawthorne to allow Dragon to perform another engine burn that brought it {{convert|250|m|ft}} from the station. At this distance, Dragon began using its close-range guidance systems, composed of [[LIDAR]] and thermal imagers. These systems confirmed that Dragon's position and velocity are accurate by comparing the LIDAR image that Dragon receives against Dragon's thermal imagers. The Dragon flight control team in Hawthorne, with assistance from the NASA flight control team at the Johnson Space Center's International Space Station Flight Control Room, commanded the spacecraft to approach the station from its hold position. After another go/no-go was performed by the Houston and Hawthorne teams, Dragon was permitted to enter the Keep-Out Sphere (KOS), an imaginary sphere drawn {{convert|200|m|ft}} around the station that reduces the risk of collision. Dragon proceeded to a position {{convert|30|m|ft}} from the station and was automatically held. Another go/no-go was completed. Then Dragon proceeded to the {{convert|10|m|ft}} position \u2014 the capture point. A final go/no-go was performed, and the Mission Control Houston team notified the crew they were going for the capture of Dragon.<ref name=\"Presskit\"/>\n\nAt that point, Expedition 33 crewmember [[Akihiko Hoshide]] of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency used the station's {{convert|17.6|m|ft}} robotic arm, known as [[Mobile Servicing System#Canadarm2 |Canadarm2]], reached for and grappled the Dragon spacecraft at 10:56 UTC.<ref name=SPACENOW10/> Hoshide, with the help of Expedition 33 Commander [[Sunita Williams]] of NASA, guided Dragon to the Earth-facing side of the station's [[Harmony module]]. Williams and Hoshide swapped places and Williams gently berthed Dragon to Harmony's [[Common Berthing Mechanism]] at 13:03 UTC.<ref name=SPACENOW10/>\n\nThe opening of the hatch between Dragon and the Harmony module, which was originally not scheduled to occur until 11 October, was moved up and occurred at 17:40 UTC.<ref name=SPACENOW10/>\n\n=== Remainder of mission (11 to 28 October) ===\n[[File:SpX CRS-1 berthed - cropped.jpg|thumb|right|A Dragon as seen from [[Cupola (ISS module)|Cupola]] on 14 October 2012.]]\n\nOver a period of two and a half weeks, the ISS crew unloaded Dragon's payload and reloaded it with cargo for return to Earth.<ref name=\"Presskit\"/>{{Failed verification|date=November 2012}}<!-- a source from before the flight does not confirm that the planned event became a past-tense historical fact; needs a better source, or the prose needs to speak to the mission plan as outlined in the presskit -->\n\nAfter its mission at the orbital laboratory was completed, newly arrived Expedition 33 Flight Engineer [[Kevin A. Ford|Kevin Ford]] used the Canadarm2 robotic arm to detach Dragon from Harmony, maneuver it out to the 15-meter (50-foot) release point, and release the vehicle. Dragon then performed a series of three burns to place it on a trajectory away from the station. Approximately six hours after Dragon departed the station, it conducted a deorbit burn, which lasted up to 10 minutes.

SpaceX uses a 100-foot boat equipped with an A-frame and an articulating crane, a 90-foot crew boat for telemetry operations, and two 24-foot rigid-hull inflatable boats to perform recovery operations. On board are approximately a dozen SpaceX engineers and technicians as well as a four-person dive team. Once the Dragon capsule splashed down, the recovery team secured the vehicle and then placed it on deck for the journey back to shore.{{Failed verification|date=November 2012}}<!-- a source from before the flight does not confirm that the planned event became a past-tense historical fact; needs a better source, or the prose needs to speak to the mission plan as outlined in the presskit --><ref name=\"Presskit\"/>\n\nSpaceX technicians opened the side hatch of the vehicle and retrieved the time-critical items.

The higher the orbit, the more test data [Orbcomm] can gather, so they requested that we attempt to restart and raise altitude. NASA agreed to allow that, but only on condition that there be substantial propellant reserves, since the orbit would be close to the space station.  It is important to appreciate that Orbcomm understood from the beginning that the orbit-raising maneuver was tentative. They accepted that there was a high risk of their satellite remaining at the Dragon insertion orbit. SpaceX would not have agreed to fly their satellite otherwise, since this was not part of the core mission and there was a known, material risk of no altitude raise.}}</ref><ref name=\"orbcomm total loss\">[http://spaceflightnow.com/falcon9/004/121011orbcomm/ Orbcomm craft falls to Earth, company claims total loss]</ref>\n\nBoth SpaceX and Orbcomm were aware, prior to the mission, of the high risk that the secondary payload satellite could remain at the lower altitude of the Dragon insertion orbit, and that was a risk that Orbcomm agreed to take given the dramatically lower cost of launch for a secondary payload.<ref name=sn20121011/>\n{{clear}}\n\n== Launch attempts ==\n\n{{LaunchAttempt\n|df=yes| date1 = 2012-10-08 00:34:07 UTC\n| result1 = Partial Success: success for primary payload, failure for secondary payload\n| reason1 = \n| decision_date1 = \n| decision_clock1= \n| weathergo1 = 80<ref name=\"NASA EH\">{{cite video |title=NASA Education Hour |publisher=NASA TV |date=8 October 2012 |location=Television}}</ref><ref name=\"NASA Station Archive\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/living/launch/crs_rss_feed_collection_archive_1.html |title='Everything is Looking Real Good for Launch' |publisher=NASA |date=7 October 2012 |accessdate=7 October 2012}}</ref>\n| notes1 = At 79 seconds into the launch, Engine 1 lost pressure and was commanded by the rocket to shut down.<ref name=\"SpaceX CRS-1 Mission Update\">{{cite web |url=http://www.spacex.com/press/2012/12/19/spacex-crs-1-mission-update|title=SPACEX CRS-1 MISSION UPDATE |accessdate=9 October 2012}}</ref> Due to the engine failure on the first stage, safety protocols for rendezvous with the ISS prevented the secondary-payload Orbcomm Satellite from being placed in the correct orbit.<ref name=\"Orbcomm OG2\">{{cite web |url=https://www.orbcomm.com/pdf/files/ORBCOMM_Launches_Prototype_OG2_Satellite_FINAL.pdf |title=ORBCOMM LAUNCHES PROTOTYPE OG2 SATELLITE |accessdate=9 October 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021004407/http://www.orbcomm.com/Collateral/Documents/English-US/ORBCOMM%20Launches%20Prototype%20OG2%20Satellite%20FINAL.pdf |archive-date=21 October 2012}}</ref>}}\n\n== Falcon 9 engine anomaly ==\n[[File:SpaceX CRS-1 Launch.ogv|thumb|right|Video of the launch of SpaceX CRS-1 Falcon 9]]\n\nDuring the ascent, 79 seconds<ref name=innerspace20121009 /> after launch, an engine anomaly occurred with one of the nine engines on the Falcon 9 first stage.

During flight, the data suggests this material flaw ultimately developed into a breach in the main combustion chamber. This breach released a jet of hot gas and fuel in the direction of the main fuel line causing a secondary leak and ultimately a rapid drop in engine pressure. As a result, the flight computer commanded shutdown of engine 1 and Falcon 9 continued on its path to ensure Dragon's entry into orbit for subsequent rendezvous and berthing with the ISS.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://aviationweek.com/blog/spacex-engine-anomaly-overview |title=SpaceX: Engine Anomaly Overview |publisher=Aviationweek.com |date= |accessdate=8 October 2013}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Spaceflight}}\n* [[List of Falcon 9 launches]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist |colwidth=30em |refs=\n\n<ref name=HARTMAN>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/672214main_1-Hartman_July12_NAC_Final_508.pdf |title=International Space Station Program Status |last=Hartman |first=Dan |date=23 July 2012 |publisher=NASA |accessdate=18 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Presskit\">\n{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/694166main_SpaceXCRS-1PressKit.pdf |title=SpX CRS-1 Mission Press Kit |date=4 October 2012 |publisher=NASA, SpaceX, 45th Space Wing |accessdate=6 October 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"SpaceX Launch Manifest\">\n{{cite web |title=SpaceX Launch Manifest |publisher=SpaceX |url=http://www.spacex.com/launch_manifest.php |accessdate=31 May 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"NASA Launch Schedule\">\n{{cite web |title=NASA's Consolidated Launch Schedule |publisher=NASA |url=http://www.nasa.gov/missions/highlights/schedule.html |accessdate=21 June 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"NASAsept20\">\n{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/spacex-crs1-target.html |title=SpaceX, NASA Target Oct. 7 Launch For Resupply Mission To Space Station |date=20 September 2012 |publisher=NASA |accessdate=26 September 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Clark 18 May 2012\">\n{{cite web |last=Clark |first=Stephen |date=18 May 2012 |title=SpaceX's historic commercial mission is 'just a test flight' |publisher=SpaceFlightNow |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/falcon9/003/120518commercial/ |accessdate=25 August 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=ClarkOct28>{{cite web |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/falcon9/004/121028splashdown/#.UI_fCIa_PKg |title=Return of the Dragon: Commercial craft back home |last=Clark |first=Stephen |date=28 October 2012 |publisher=SpaceFlightNow |accessdate=30 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Clark 24 August 2012\">\n{{cite web |title=NASA ready for operational cargo flights by SpaceX |last=Clark |first=Stephen |date=24 August 2012 |publisher=SpaceFlightNow |url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n1208/24cots/ |accessdate=25 August 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=SPACENOW10>{{cite web |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/falcon9/004/121010arrival/ |title=Dragon arrives at station with commercial delivery |last=Clark |first=Stephen |date=10 October 2012 |publisher=SpaceFlightNow |accessdate=18 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Orbcomm 25 May 2012\">\n{{cite press |title=Orbcomm Eagerly Awaits Launch of New Satellite on Next Falcon 9 |date=25 May 2012 |publisher=Space News |url=http://www.spacenews.com/satellite_telecom/120525-spacex-success-welcome-orbcomm.html |accessdate=28 May 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Hartman 23 July 2012\">\n{{cite web |last=Hartman |first=Dan |date=23 July 2012 |title=International Space Station Program Status |publisher=NASA |url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/672214main_1-Hartman_July12_NAC_Final_508.pdf |accessdate=28 August 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Sept29\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2012/09/falcon-9-hot-fires-engines-iss-prepares-dragons-arrival/ |title=Falcon 9 hot fires its engines as the ISS prepares for Dragon's arrival |last=Bergin |first=Chris |date=29 September 2012 |publisher=NASASpaceFlight (not associated with NASA) |accessdate=29 September 2012}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"AugustChris\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2012/08/spacex-conduct-successful-wdr-falcon-9/ |title=SpaceX conduct successful WDR on their latest Falcon 9 |last=Bergin |first=Chris |date=31 August 2012 |publisher=NASASpaceFlight (not associated with NASA) |accessdate=1 September 2012}}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|SpaceX CRS-1}}\n*[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/living/launch/index.html SpaceX CRS-1 NASA page]\n*[http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/694166main_SpaceXCRS-1PressKit.pdf SpaceX CRS-1 Mission Press Kit (4 October 2012)]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I7loLnDYyU Video of Static Fire test -
