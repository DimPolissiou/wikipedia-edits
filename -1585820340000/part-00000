Stein]].{{r|s67}} Stein originally called the tripods of this problem \"semicrosses\", and they were also called '''Stein corners''' by [[Solomon W. Golomb]].{{r|g}} The problem can also be formulated in terms of finding 2-comparable sets of triples, of filling matrices with monotone values, or of finding compatible sets of triangles in a convex polygon.{{r|admos}}\n\nThe best lower bound known for the number of tripods that can have their apexes packed into an <math>n\\times n\\times n</math> grid is <math>\\Omega(n^{1.546})</math>, and the best upper bound is <math>O\\bigl(n^2/\\exp O(\\log^* n)\\bigr)</math>.{{r|admos|gl}}\n\n==Equivalent problems==\nThe coordinates <math>(x_i,y_i,z_i)</math> of the apexes of a solution to the tripod problem form a '''2-comparable sets of triples''', where two triples are defined as being 2-comparable if there are either at least two coordinates where one triple is smaller than the other, or at least two coordinates where one triple is larger than the other. This condition ensures that the tripods defined from these triples do not have intersecting rays.{{r|admos}}\n\nAnother equivalent two-dimensional version of the question asks how many cells of an <math>n\\times n</math> array of square cells (indexed from <math>1</math> to <math>n</math>) can be filled in by the numbers from <math>1</math> to <math>n</math> in such a way that the non-empty cells of each row and each column of the array form strictly increasing sequences of numbers, and the positions holding each value <math>i</math> form a monotone chain within the array. A collection of disjoint tripods with apexes <math>(x_i,y_i,z_i)</math> can be transformed into an array of this type by placing the number <math>z_i</math> in array cell <math>(x_i,y_i)</math> and vice versa.{{r|admos}}\n\nThe problem is also equivalent to finding as many triangles as possible among the vertices of a convex polygon, such that no two triangles that share a vertex have nested angles at that vertex. This triangle-counting problem was posed by Peter Bra\u00df{{r|b}} and its equivalence to tripod packing was observed by Aronov et al.{{r|admos}}\n\n==Lower bounds==\nIt is straightforward to find a solution to the tripod packing problem with <math>\\Omega(n^{3/2})</math> tripods.{{r|admos}} For instance, for <math>k=\\lfloor\\sqrt{n}\\rfloor</math>, the <math>\\Omega(n^{3/2})</math> triples\n:<math>\\bigl\\{ (ak+b+1,bk+c+1,ak+c+1) \\big| a,b,c\\in[0,k-1]\\bigr\\}</math>\nare 2-comparable.\n\nAfter several earlier improvements to this na\u00efve bound,{{r|hs|s95|t}} Gowers and Long found solutions to the tripod problem of cardinality <math>\\Omega(n^{1.546})</math>.{{r|gl}}\n\n==Upper bounds==\nFrom any solution to the tripod packing problem, one can derive a balanced tripartite graph whose vertices are three copies of the numbers from <math>0</math> to <math>n-1</math> (one for each of the three coordinates) with a triangle of edges connecting the three vertices corresponding to the coordinates of the apex of each tripod. There are no other triangles in these graphs (they are [[locally linear graph]]s) because any other triangle would lead to a violation of 2-comparability. Therefore, by the known upper bounds to the [[Ruzsa\u2013Szemer\u00e9di problem]] (one version of which is to find the maximum density of edges in a balanced tripartite locally linear graph), the maximum number of disjoint tripods that can be packed in an <math>n\\times n\\times n</math> grid is <math>o(n^2)</math>, and more precisely <math>O\\bigl(n^2/\\exp O(\\log^* n)\\bigr)</math>.{{r|admos|gl|t|l}} Although Tiskin writes that \"tighter analysis of the parameters\" can produce a bound that is less than quadratic by a polylogarithmic factor,{{r|t}} he does not supply details and his proof that the number is <math>o(n^2)</math> uses only the same techniques that are known for the Ruzsa\u2013Szemer\u00e9di problem, so this stronger claim appears to be a mistake.{{r|admos}}\n\nAn argument of Dean Hickerson shows that, because tripods cannot pack space with constant density, the same is true for analogous problems in higher dimensions.{{r|ss}}\n\n==Small instances==\nFor small instances of the tripod problem, the exact solution is known.

It is [[Diurnality|diurnal]], meaning most of its activities take place during the day. Anything smaller than itself will be eagerly devoured. The diets of hatchlings and juveniles often consist mostly of [[insect]]s and small [[lizard]]s, but generally varies more with age. Adult monitors will [[prey]] on [[mice]], small [[bird]]s, large insects, small lizard species, [[snake]]s, and carrion. They are seemingly immune to snake venom and will kill and eat even the most venomous species such as the [[Inland taipan]]. The sand goanna does consume smaller species of monitors: Ackies, rock monitors and other dwarf species are often found and eaten. It is common to see a Gould's disturbing rock piles in an attempt to flush out any ''[[Odatria]]''. It lays its [[egg (biology)|egg]]s in [[termite#Mounds|termite mounds]] to protect them from the harsh [[desert]] climate.\nLike all goannas and [[snake]]s the sand monitor has a forked tongue, with which it \"tastes\" the air. Scents are picked up on each side of the fork which, when retracted, brushes over an area in the mouth called the [[Vomeronasal organ|Jacobson's organ]], which identifies on which side the scent is stronger.

The effect is presumed to be that when the ant grooms its leg, the tactile sensation is as it would be in mite-free grooming.<ref name=\"H\u00f6lldoblerWilson1990\">{{cite book |last1=H\u00f6lldobler |first1=Bert |last2=Wilson |first2=Edward O. |title=The Ants |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ljxV4h61vhUC&pg=PA512 |year=1990 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-04075-5 |pages=511\u2013514}}</ref>\n\nTactile mimicry is found in the cricket ''[[Myrmecophila acervorum]]''; its relationship with ants was first studied by Paolo Savis in 1819. It has many ant species as hosts, and occurs in large and small morphs suited to large hosts like ''[[Formica]]'' and ''[[Myrmica]]'', and the small workers of species such as ''[[Lasius]]''. On first arriving in an ants' nest, the crickets are attacked by the workers, and are killed if they do not run fast enough, but within a few days they adjust their movements to match those of their hosts, and are then tolerated. Mimicry appears to be achieved by a combination of \"social releasers\", whether by imitating \"solicitation signals\" with suitable behaviour or ant pheromones with suitable chemicals; H\u00f6lldobler and Wilson (1990) propose that Wasmannian mimicry be redefined to permit any such combination.<ref name=\"H\u00f6lldoblerWilson1990\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://bugguide.net/node/view/50723/49443 Pictures of ''Coleosoma acutiventer'']\n* [http://naturemagnified.blogspot.com/2010/02/ants-spiders-and-ant-spiders.html Pictures of ant spiders]\n\n{{Mimicry}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ant Mimicry}}\n[[Category:Myrmecology]]\n[[Category:Mimicry]]\n[[Category:Spiders]]\n[[Category:Ants]]\n", "name_user": "Rjwilmsi", "label": "safe", "comment": "Journal cites:, templated 3 journal cites", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant_mimicry"}

Producers Theodore and Leopold Wharton commissioned him to write story lines for their films, including ''Pauline''. The Whartons also eventually adapted Flynn's experiences into a 20-part spy thriller titled ''The Eagle's Eye'' (1918), starring Baggot.<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Mike Dash|Dash, Mike]]|title= The First Family: Terror, Extortion and the Birth of the American Mafia |location=London |publisher=Simon & Schuster|year= 2009|isbn=978-1-84737-173-7|page=Epilogue, page 10}}</ref>\n\nSurviving chapters of ''Pauline'' are noteworthy for their unintentionally funny title cards and dialogue captions, filled with misspellings, poor punctuation, terrible grammar, and odd expressions. This happened when Path\u00e9, the theatrical distributor, exported the film to [[France]]. The film was recut and adapted for home-movie use, and all of the printed captions were translated into [[French language|French]].

Individuals with acute MR are typically severely symptomatic and will have the signs and symptoms of acute decompensated [[congestive heart failure]] (i.e. [[shortness of breath]], [[pulmonary edema]], [[orthopnea]], and [[paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea]]<ref name=agabegi2nd-ch1/>), as well as symptoms of cardiogenic shock (i.e., shortness of breath at rest). Cardiovascular collapse with [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]] ([[cardiogenic shock]]) may be seen in individuals with acute MR due to [[papillary muscle]] rupture, rupture of a [[chordae tendineae|chorda tendinea]] or infective endocarditis of the mitral valve.\n\nIndividuals with chronic compensated MR may be asymptomatic for long periods of time, with a normal exercise tolerance and no evidence of heart failure. Over time, however, there may be decompensation and patients can develop [[volume overload]] ([[congestive heart failure]]). Symptoms of entry into a decompensated phase may include fatigue, shortness of breath particularly on exertion, and leg swelling. Also there may be development of an irregular heart rhythm known as [[atrial fibrillation]].<ref name=agabegi2nd-ch1/>\n\nFindings on clinical examination depend on the severity and duration of MR. The mitral component of the [[first heart sound]] is usually soft and with a laterally displaced apex beat,<ref name=agabegi2nd-ch1/> often with [[Parasternal heave|heave]].<ref name=uas/> The first heart sound is followed by a high-pitched [[holosystolic murmur]] at the apex, radiating to the back or clavicular area.<ref name=agabegi2nd-ch1/> Its duration is, as the name suggests, the whole of systole.

The ''[[chordae tendineae]]'' are also present and connect the valve leaflets to the papillary muscles.  Dysfunction of any of these portions of the mitral valve apparatus can cause regurgitation.\n\nThe most common cause of MR in developing countries is [[mitral valve prolapse]] (MVP).<ref name='MedicineNetMVP-Kulick'>{{cite web|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/mitral_valve_prolapse/article.htm |title=Mitral Valve Prolapse (MVP) |accessdate=2010-01-18 |last=Kulick |first=Daniel |work=MedicineNet.com |publisher=MedicineNet, Inc }}</ref> It is the most common cause of primary mitral regurgitation in the [[United States]], causing about 50% of cases. Myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve is more common in women as well as with advancing age, which causes a stretching of the leaflets of the valve and the chordae tendineae. Such elongation prevents the valve leaflets from fully coming together when the valve closes, causing the valve leaflets to prolapse into the left atrium, thereby causing MR.\n\n[[Ischemic heart disease]] causes MR by the combination of ischemic dysfunction of the papillary muscles, and the dilatation of the left ventricle. This can lead to the subsequent displacement of the papillary muscles and the dilatation of the mitral valve annulus.\n\n[[Rheumatic fever]] (RF) and [[Marfan's syndrome]] are other typical causes.<ref name=agabegi2nd-ch1/> [[Mitral valve stenosis]] (MVS) can sometimes be a cause of mitral regurgitation (MR) in the sense that a stenotic valve (calcified and with restricted range of movement) allows backflow (regurgitation) if it is too stiff and misshapen to close completely. Most MVS is caused by RF, so one can say that MVS is sometimes the proximal cause of MI/MR (that is, stenotic MI/MR) and that RF is often the distal cause of MVS, MI/MR, or both. MR and mitral valve prolapse are also common in [[Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndromes]].<ref>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0002439] NIH US National Library of Medicine, A.D.A.M.

This dilatation of the left ventricle can be due to any cause of [[dilated cardiomyopathy]] including [[aortic insufficiency]], nonischemic dilated [[cardiomyopathy]], and [[Noncompaction cardiomyopathy]].

The left ventricle develops volume overload because with every contraction it now has to pump out not only the volume of blood that goes into the [[aorta]] (the forward [[cardiac output]] or forward stroke volume) but also the blood that regurgitates into the left atrium (the regurgitant volume). The combination of the forward stroke volume and the regurgitant volume is known as the total stroke volume of the left ventricle.\n\nIn the acute setting, the stroke volume of the left ventricle is increased (increased [[ejection fraction]]); this happens because of more complete emptying of the heart. However, as it progresses the LV volume increases and the contractile function deteriorates, thus leading to dysfunctional LV and a decrease in ejection fraction.<ref>Harrison's Internal Medicine 17th edition</ref> The increase in stroke volume is explained by the [[Frank\u2013Starling mechanism]], in which increased ventricular pre-load stretches the myocardium such that contractions are more forceful.\n\nThe regurgitant volume causes a volume overload and a [[pressure overload]] of the left atrium and the left ventricle.  The increased pressures in the left side of the heart may inhibit drainage of blood from the lungs via the pulmonary veins and lead to [[congestive heart failure|pulmonary congestion]].\n\n===Chronic phase===\n\n====Compensated====\nIf the MR develops slowly over months to years or if the acute phase cannot be managed with medical therapy, the individual will enter the chronic compensated phase of the disease.  In this phase, the left ventricle develops eccentric hypertrophy in order to better manage the larger than normal stroke volume.  The eccentric hypertrophy and the increased diastolic volume combine to increase the stroke volume (to levels well above normal) so that the forward stroke volume (forward cardiac output) approaches the normal levels.\n\nIn the left atrium, the volume overload causes enlargement of the left atrium, allowing the filling pressure in the left atrium to decrease.  This improves the drainage from the pulmonary veins, and signs and symptoms of pulmonary congestion will decrease.\n\nThese changes in the left ventricle and left atrium improve the low forward cardiac output state and the pulmonary congestion that occur in the acute phase of the disease.  Individuals in the chronic compensated phase may be asymptomatic and have normal exercise tolerances.\n\n====Decompensated====\nAn individual may be in the compensated phase of MR for years, but will eventually develop left ventricular dysfunction, the hallmark for the chronic decompensated phase of MR. It is currently unclear what causes an individual to enter the decompensated phase of this disease.  However, the decompensated phase is characterized by calcium overload within the cardiac [[myocyte]]s.\n\nIn this phase, the ventricular myocardium is no longer able to contract adequately to compensate for the volume overload of mitral regurgitation, and the stroke volume of the left ventricle will decrease.  The decreased stroke volume causes a decreased forward cardiac output and an increase in the [[Systole (medicine)|end-systolic]] volume.  The increased end-systolic volume translates to increased filling pressures of the left ventricle and increased pulmonary venous congestion.  The individual may again have symptoms of congestive heart failure.\n\nThe left ventricle begins to dilate during this phase.  This causes a dilatation of the mitral valve annulus, which may worsen the degree of MR. The dilated left ventricle causes an increase in the wall stress of the cardiac chamber as well.\n\nWhile the [[ejection fraction]] is less in the chronic decompensated phase than in the acute phase or the chronic compensated phase, it may still be in the normal range (i.e.: > 50 percent), and may not decrease until late in the disease course.  A decreased ejection fraction in an individual with MR and no other cardiac abnormality should alert the physician that the disease may be in its decompensated phase.\n\n==Diagnosis==\nThere are many diagnostic tests that have abnormal results in the presence of MR. These tests suggest the diagnosis of MR and may indicate to the physician that further testing is warranted.  For instance, the [[electrocardiogram]] (ECG) in long-standing MR may show evidence of left atrial enlargement and [[left ventricular hypertrophy]].  [[Atrial fibrillation]] may also be noted on the ECG in individuals with chronic mitral regurgitation.  The ECG may not show any of these findings in the setting of acute MR.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Comparison of acute and chronic phases of MR\n|-\n!\n! scope=\"col\" | Acute\n! scope=\"col\" | Chronic\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Electrocardiogram]]\n| Normal\n| P mitrale, [[Atrial fibrillation]], [[left ventricular hypertrophy]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Heart size\n| Normal\n| Cardiomegaly, left atrial enlargement\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Heart sounds|Systolic murmur]]\n| Heard at the base, radiates to the neck, spine, or top of head\n| Heard at the apex, radiates to the axilla\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Apical thrill\n| May be absent\n| Present\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Jugular venous pressure|Jugular venous distension]]\n| Present\n| Absent\n|}\n\nThe quantification of MR usually employs [[medical imaging technique|imaging studies]] such as [[echocardiography]] or [[magnetic resonance angiography]] of the heart.\n\n===Chest X-ray===\nThe chest [[X-ray]] in individuals with chronic MR is characterized by enlargement of the left atrium and the left ventricle.<ref name=agabegi2nd-ch1/> The pulmonary vascular markings are typically normal, since pulmonary venous pressures are usually not significantly elevated.\n\n===Echocardiography===\n[[File:Mitralinsuff TEE.jpg|right|thumb|400px|Transesophageal echocardiogram of mitral valve prolapse]]\nThe [[echocardiogram]] is commonly used to confirm the diagnosis of MR. Color doppler flow on the transthoracic [[echocardiogram]] (TTE) will reveal a jet of blood flowing from the left ventricle into the left atrium during ventricular [[Systole (medicine)|systole]]. Also, it may detect a dilated left atrium and ventricle and decreased left ventricular function.<ref name=agabegi2nd-ch1/>\n\nBecause of inability to obtain accurate images of the left atrium and the pulmonary veins with a transthoracic echocardiogram, a [[transesophageal echocardiogram]] may be necessary in some cases to determine the severity of MR.\n\n===Electrocardiography===\n''P mitrale'' is broad, notched P waves in several or many leads with a prominent late negative component to the P wave in lead V<sub>1</sub>, and may be seen in MR, but also in [[mitral stenosis]], and, potentially, any cause of overload of the left atrium.<ref name=stedmans>[http://www.medilexicon.com/medicaldictionary.php?t=70229 medilexicon.com < P mitrale] Citing. Stedman's Medical Dictionary. Copyright 2006</ref> Thus, ''P-sinistrocardiale'' may be a more appropriate term.<ref name=stedmans/>\n\n===Quantification of mitral insufficiency=== \nThe degree of severity of MR can be quantified by the [[regurgitant fraction]], which is the percentage of the left ventricular stroke volume that regurgitates into the left atrium.\n\n:regurgitant fraction &nbsp; = &nbsp;  <math>\\frac{V_{mitral} - V_{aortic}} {V_{mitral}}  \\times  100\\%</math>\n\nwhere V<sub>mitral</sub> and V<sub>aortic</sub> are, respectively, the volumes of blood that flow forward  through the mitral valve and aortic valve during a [[cardiac cycle]].  \nMethods that have been used to assess the regurgitant fraction in mitral regurgitation include echocardiography, cardiac catheterization, fast CT scan, and cardiac MRI.\n\nThe echocardiographic technique to measure the regurgitant fraction is to determine the forward flow through the mitral valve (from the left atrium to the left ventricle) during ventricular [[diastole]], and comparing it with the flow out of the left ventricle through the aortic valve in ventricular [[Systole (medicine)|systole]].  This method assumes that the aortic valve does not suffer from [[aortic insufficiency]].\n\nAnother way to quantify the degree of MR is to determine the area of the regurgitant flow at the level of the valve.  This is known as the regurgitant orifice area, and correlates with the size of the defect in the mitral valve. One particular echocardiographic technique used to measure the orifice area is measurement of the [[proximal isovelocity surface area]] (PISA).  The flaw of using PISA to determine the mitral valve regurgitant orifice area is that it measures the flow at one moment in time in the [[cardiac cycle]], which may not reflect the average performance of the regurgitant jet.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto\"\n|+ Determination of the degree of mitral regurgitation\n|-\n!

In general, medical therapy is non-curative and is used for mild-to-moderate regurgitation or in patients unable to tolerate surgery.\n\nIn acute MR secondary to a mechanical defect in the heart (i.e., rupture of a papillary muscle or chordae tendineae), the treatment of choice is mitral valve surgery.  If the patient is hypotensive prior to the surgical procedure, an [[intra-aortic balloon pump]] may be placed in order to improve perfusion of the organs and to decrease the degree of MR.<ref name=agabegi2nd-ch1/>\n\n===Medicine===\nIf the individual with acute MR is normotensive, vasodilators may be of use to decrease the [[afterload]] seen by the left ventricle and thereby decrease the regurgitant fraction. The vasodilator most commonly used is [[nitroprusside]].\n\nIndividuals with chronic MR can be treated with vasodilators as well to decrease afterload.<ref name=agabegi2nd-ch1/> In the chronic state, the most commonly used agents are [[ACE inhibitor]]s and [[hydralazine]]. Studies have shown that the use of ACE inhibitors and hydralazine can delay surgical treatment of MR.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Greenberg BH, Massie BM, Brundage BH, Botvinick EH, Parmley WW, Chatterjee K |title=Beneficial effects of hydralazine in severe mitral regurgitation |journal=Circulation |volume=58 |issue=2 |pages=273\u20139 |year=1978 |pmid=668075 |doi= 10.1161/01.cir.58.2.273|url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Hoit BD |title=Medical treatment of valvular heart disease |journal=Curr.

There are two surgical options for the treatment of MR: [[mitral valve replacement]] and [[mitral valve repair]].<ref name=agabegi2nd-ch1/> Mitral valve repair is preferred to mitral valve replacement where a repair is feasible as bioprosthetic replacement valves have a limited lifespan of 10 to 15 years, whereas synthetic replacement valves require ongoing use of blood thinners to reduce the risk of stroke. There are two general categories of approaches to mitral valve repair: resection of the prolapsed valvular segment (sometimes referred to as the \"Carpentier\" approach) and installation of artificial chordae to \"anchor\" the prolapsed segment to the papillary muscle (sometimes referred to as the \"David\" approach). With the resection approach, any prolapsing tissue is resected, in effect removing the hole through which the blood is leaking. In the artificial chordae approach, ePTFE (expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, or [[Gore-Tex]]) sutures are used to replace the broken or stretched chordae tendonae, bringing the natural tissue back into the physiological position, thus restoring the natural anatomy of the valve.  With both techniques, an annuloplasty ring is typically secured to the annulus, or opening of the mitral valve, to provide additional structural support.  In some cases, the \"double orifice\" (or 'Alfieri') technique for mitral valve repair, the opening of the mitral valve is sewn closed in the middle, leaving the two ends still able to open. This ensures that the mitral valve closes when the left ventricle pumps blood, yet allows the mitral valve to open at the two ends to fill  the left ventricle with blood before it pumps.  In general, mitral valve surgery  requires \"open-heart\" surgery in which the heart is arrested and the patient is placed on a heart-lung machine ([[cardiopulmonary bypass]]).  This allows the complex surgery to proceed in a still environment.\n\nDue to the physiological stress associated with open-heart surgery, elderly and very sick patients may be subject to increased risk, and may not be candidates for this type of surgery. As a consequence, there are attempts to identify means of correcting MR on a beating heart.

Cardiovascular collapse with [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]] ([[cardiogenic shock]]) may be seen in individuals with acute MR due to [[papillary muscle]] rupture, rupture of a [[chordae tendineae|chorda tendinea]] or infective endocarditis of the mitral valve.\n\nIndividuals with chronic compensated MR may be asymptomatic for long periods of time, with a normal exercise tolerance and no evidence of heart failure. Over time, however, there may be decompensation and patients can develop [[volume overload]] ([[congestive heart failure]]). Symptoms of entry into a decompensated phase may include fatigue, shortness of breath particularly on exertion, and leg swelling. Also there may be development of an irregular heart rhythm known as [[atrial fibrillation]].<ref name=agabegi2nd-ch1/>\n\nFindings on clinical examination depend on the severity and duration of MR. The mitral component of the [[first heart sound]] is usually soft and with a laterally displaced apex beat,<ref name=agabegi2nd-ch1/> often with [[Parasternal heave|heave]].<ref name=uas/> The first heart sound is followed by a high-pitched [[holosystolic murmur]] at the apex, radiating to the back or clavicular area.<ref name=agabegi2nd-ch1/> Its duration is, as the name suggests, the whole of systole.

The ''[[chordae tendineae]]'' are also present and connect the valve leaflets to the papillary muscles.  Dysfunction of any of these portions of the mitral valve apparatus can cause regurgitation.\n\nThe most common cause of MR in developing countries is [[mitral valve prolapse]] (MVP).<ref name='MedicineNetMVP-Kulick'>{{cite web|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/mitral_valve_prolapse/article.htm |title=Mitral Valve Prolapse (MVP) |accessdate=2010-01-18 |last=Kulick |first=Daniel |work=MedicineNet.com |publisher=MedicineNet, Inc }}</ref> It is the most common cause of primary mitral regurgitation in the [[United States]], causing about 50% of cases. Myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve is more common in women as well as with advancing age, which causes a stretching of the leaflets of the valve and the chordae tendineae. Such elongation prevents the valve leaflets from fully coming together when the valve closes, causing the valve leaflets to prolapse into the left atrium, thereby causing MR.\n\n[[Ischemic heart disease]] causes MR by the combination of ischemic dysfunction of the papillary muscles, and the dilatation of the left ventricle. This can lead to the subsequent displacement of the papillary muscles and the dilatation of the mitral valve annulus.\n\n[[Rheumatic fever]] (RF) and [[Marfan's syndrome]] are other typical causes.<ref name=agabegi2nd-ch1/> [[Mitral valve stenosis]] (MVS) can sometimes be a cause of mitral regurgitation (MR) in the sense that a stenotic valve (calcified and with restricted range of movement) allows backflow (regurgitation) if it is too stiff and misshapen to close completely. Most MVS is caused by RF, so one can say that MVS is sometimes the proximal cause of MI/MR (that is, stenotic MI/MR) and that RF is often the distal cause of MVS, MI/MR, or both. MR and mitral valve prolapse are also common in [[Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndromes]].<ref>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0002439] NIH US National Library of Medicine, A.D.A.M.

The left ventricle develops volume overload because with every contraction it now has to pump out not only the volume of blood that goes into the [[aorta]] (the forward [[cardiac output]] or forward stroke volume) but also the blood that regurgitates into the left atrium (the regurgitant volume). The combination of the forward stroke volume and the regurgitant volume is known as the total stroke volume of the left ventricle.\n\nIn the acute setting, the stroke volume of the left ventricle is increased (increased [[ejection fraction]]); this happens because of more complete emptying of the heart. However, as it progresses the LV volume increases and the contractile function deteriorates, thus leading to dysfunctional LV and a decrease in ejection fraction.<ref>Harrison's Internal Medicine 17th edition</ref> The increase in stroke volume is explained by the [[Frank\u2013Starling mechanism]], in which increased ventricular pre-load stretches the myocardium such that contractions are more forceful.\n\nThe regurgitant volume causes a volume overload and a [[pressure overload]] of the left atrium and the left ventricle.  The increased pressures in the left side of the heart may inhibit drainage of blood from the lungs via the pulmonary veins and lead to [[congestive heart failure|pulmonary congestion]].\n\n===Chronic phase===\n\n====Compensated====\nIf the MR develops slowly over months to years or if the acute phase cannot be managed with medical therapy, the individual will enter the chronic compensated phase of the disease.  In this phase, the left ventricle develops eccentric hypertrophy in order to better manage the larger than normal stroke volume.  The eccentric hypertrophy and the increased diastolic volume combine to increase the stroke volume (to levels well above normal) so that the forward stroke volume (forward cardiac output) approaches the normal levels.\n\nIn the left atrium, the volume overload causes enlargement of the left atrium, allowing the filling pressure in the left atrium to decrease.  This improves the drainage from the pulmonary veins, and signs and symptoms of pulmonary congestion will decrease.\n\nThese changes in the left ventricle and left atrium improve the low forward cardiac output state and the pulmonary congestion that occur in the acute phase of the disease.  Individuals in the chronic compensated phase may be asymptomatic and have normal exercise tolerances.\n\n====Decompensated====\nAn individual may be in the compensated phase of MR for years, but will eventually develop left ventricular dysfunction, the hallmark for the chronic decompensated phase of MR. It is currently unclear what causes an individual to enter the decompensated phase of this disease.  However, the decompensated phase is characterized by calcium overload within the cardiac [[myocyte]]s.\n\nIn this phase, the ventricular myocardium is no longer able to contract adequately to compensate for the volume overload of mitral regurgitation, and the stroke volume of the left ventricle will decrease.  The decreased stroke volume causes a decreased forward cardiac output and an increase in the [[Systole (medicine)|end-systolic]] volume.  The increased end-systolic volume translates to increased filling pressures of the left ventricle and increased pulmonary venous congestion.  The individual may again have symptoms of congestive heart failure.\n\nThe left ventricle begins to dilate during this phase.  This causes a dilatation of the mitral valve annulus, which may worsen the degree of MR. The dilated left ventricle causes an increase in the wall stress of the cardiac chamber as well.\n\nWhile the [[ejection fraction]] is less in the chronic decompensated phase than in the acute phase or the chronic compensated phase, it may still be in the normal range (i.e.: > 50 percent), and may not decrease until late in the disease course.  A decreased ejection fraction in an individual with MR and no other cardiac abnormality should alert the physician that the disease may be in its decompensated phase.\n\n==Diagnosis==\nThere are many diagnostic tests that have abnormal results in the presence of MR. These tests suggest the diagnosis of MR and may indicate to the physician that further testing is warranted.  For instance, the [[electrocardiogram]] (ECG) in long-standing MR may show evidence of left atrial enlargement and [[left ventricular hypertrophy]].  [[Atrial fibrillation]] may also be noted on the ECG in individuals with chronic mitral regurgitation.  The ECG may not show any of these findings in the setting of acute MR.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Comparison of acute and chronic phases of MR\n|-\n!\n! scope=\"col\" | Acute\n! scope=\"col\" | Chronic\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Electrocardiogram]]\n| Normal\n| P mitrale, [[Atrial fibrillation]], [[left ventricular hypertrophy]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Heart size\n| Normal\n| Cardiomegaly, left atrial enlargement\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Heart sounds|Systolic murmur]]\n| Heard at the base, radiates to the neck, spine, or top of head\n| Heard at the apex, radiates to the axilla\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Apical thrill\n| May be absent\n| Present\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Jugular venous pressure|Jugular venous distension]]\n| Present\n| Absent\n|}\n\nThe quantification of MR usually employs [[medical imaging technique|imaging studies]] such as [[echocardiography]] or [[magnetic resonance angiography]] of the heart.\n\n===Chest X-ray===\nThe chest [[X-ray]] in individuals with chronic MR is characterized by enlargement of the left atrium and the left ventricle.<ref name=agabegi2nd-ch1/> The pulmonary vascular markings are typically normal, since pulmonary venous pressures are usually not significantly elevated.\n\n===Echocardiography===\n[[File:Mitralinsuff TEE.jpg|right|thumb|400px|Transesophageal echocardiogram of mitral valve prolapse]]\nThe [[echocardiogram]] is commonly used to confirm the diagnosis of MR. Color doppler flow on the transthoracic [[echocardiogram]] (TTE) will reveal a jet of blood flowing from the left ventricle into the left atrium during ventricular [[Systole (medicine)|systole]]. Also, it may detect a dilated left atrium and ventricle and decreased left ventricular function.<ref name=agabegi2nd-ch1/>\n\nBecause of inability to obtain accurate images of the left atrium and the pulmonary veins with a transthoracic echocardiogram, a [[transesophageal echocardiogram]] may be necessary in some cases to determine the severity of MR.\n\n===Electrocardiography===\n''P mitrale'' is broad, notched P waves in several or many leads with a prominent late negative comp[[mb b [[]]]]onent to the P wave in lead V<sub>1</sub>, and may be seen in MR, but also in [[mitral stenosis]], and, potentially, any cause of overload of the left atrium.<ref name=stedmans>[http://www.medilexicon.com/medicaldictionary.php?t=70229 medilexicon.com < P mitrale] Citing. Stedman's Medical Dictionary. Copyright 2006</ref> Thus, ''P-sinistrocardiale'' may be a more appropriate term.<ref name=stedmans/>\n\n===Quantification of mitral insufficiency=== \nThe degree of severity of MR can be quantified by the [[regurgitant fraction]], which is the percentage of the left ventricular stroke volume that regurgitates into the left atrium.\n\n:regurgitant fraction &nbsp; = &nbsp;  <math>\\frac{V_{mitral} - V_{aortic}} {V_{mitral}}  \\times  100\\%</math>\n\nwhere V<sub>mitral</sub> and V<sub>aortic</sub> are, respectively, the volumes of blood that flow forward  through the mitral valve and aortic valve during a [[cardiac cycle]].  \nMethods that have been used to assess the regurgitant fraction in mitral regurgitation include echocardiography, cardiac catheterization, fast CT scan, and cardiac MRI.\n\nThe echocardiographic technique to measure the regurgitant fraction is to determine the forward flow through the mitral valve (from the left atrium to the left ventricle) during ventricular [[diastole]], and comparing it with the flow out of the left ventricle through the aortic valve in ventricular [[Systole (medicine)|systole]].  This method assumes that the aortic valve does not suffer from [[aortic insufficiency]].\n\nAnother way to quantify the degree of MR is to determine the area of the regurgitant flow at the level of the valve.  This is known as the regurgitant orifice area, and correlates with the size of the defect in the mitral valve. One particular echocardiographic technique used to measure the orifice area is measurement of the [[proximal isovelocity surface area]] (PISA).  The flaw of using PISA to determine the mitral valve regurgitant orifice area is that it measures the flow at one moment in time in the [[cardiac cycle]], which may not reflect the average performance of the regurgitant jet.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto\"\n|+ Determination of the degree of mitral regurgitation\n|-\n!

In general, medical therapy is non-curative and is used for mild-to-moderate regurgitation or in patients unable to tolerate surgery.\n\nIn acute MR secondary to a mechanical defect in the heart (i.e., rupture of a papillary muscle or chordae tendineae), the treatment of choice is mitral valve surgery.  If the patient is hypotensive prior to the surgical procedure, an [[intra-aortic balloon pump]] may be placed in order to improve perfusion of the organs and to decrease the degree of MR.<ref name=agabegi2nd-ch1/>\n\n===Medicine===\nIf the individual with acute MR is normotensive, vasodilators may be of use to decrease the [[afterload]] seen by the left ventricle and thereby decrease the regurgitant fraction. The vasodilator most commonly used is [[nitroprusside]].\n\nIndividuals with chronic MR can be treated with vasodilators as well to decrease afterload.<ref name=agabegi2nd-ch1/> In the chronic state, the most commonly used agents are [[ACE inhibitor]]s and [[hydralazine]]. Studies have shown that the use of ACE inhibitors and hydralazine can delay surgical treatment of MR.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Greenberg BH, Massie BM, Brundage BH, Botvinick EH, Parmley WW, Chatterjee K |title=Beneficial effects of hydralazine in severe mitral regurgitation |journal=Circulation |volume=58 |issue=2 |pages=273\u20139 |year=1978 |pmid=668075 |doi= 10.1161/01.cir.58.2.273|url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Hoit BD |title=Medical treatment of valvular heart disease |journal=Curr.

There are two surgical options for the treatment of MR: [[mitral valve replacement]] and [[mitral valve repair]].<ref name=agabegi2nd-ch1/> Mitral valve repair is preferred to mitral valve replacement where a repair is feasible as bioprosthetic replacement valves have a limited lifespan of 10 to 15 years, whereas synthetic replacement valves require ongoing use of blood thinners to reduce the risk of stroke. There are two general categories of approaches to mitral valve repair: resection of the prolapsed valvular segment (sometimes referred to as the \"Carpentier\" approach) and installation of artificial chordae to \"anchor\" the prolapsed segment to the papillary muscle (sometimes referred to as the \"David\" approach). With the resection approach, any prolapsing tissue is resected, in effect removing the hole through which the blood is leaking. In the artificial chordae approach, ePTFE (expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, or [[Gore-Tex]]) sutures are used to replace the broken or stretched chordae tendonae, bringing the natural tissue back into the physiological position, thus restoring the natural anatomy of the valve.  With both techniques, an annuloplasty ring is typically secured to the annulus, or opening of the mitral valve, to provide additional structural support.  In some cases, the \"double orifice\" (or 'Alfieri') technique for mitral valve repair, the opening of the mitral valve is sewn closed in the middle, leaving the two ends still able to open. This ensures that the mitral valve closes when the left ventricle pumps blood, yet allows the mitral valve to open at the two ends to fill  the left ventricle with blood before it pumps.  In general, mitral valve surgery  requires \"open-heart\" surgery in which the heart is arrested and the patient is placed on a heart-lung machine ([[cardiopulmonary bypass]]).  This allows the complex surgery to proceed in a still environment.\n\nDue to the physiological stress associated with open-heart surgery, elderly and very sick patients may be subject to increased risk, and may not be candidates for this type of surgery. As a consequence, there are attempts to identify means of correcting MR on a beating heart.  The Alfieri technique for instance, has been replicated using a percutaneous [[catheter]] technique, which installs a \"[[MitraClip]]\" device to hold the middle of the mitral valve closed.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Garg P, Walton AS |title=The new world of cardiac interventions: a brief review of the recent advances in non-coronary percutaneous interventions |journal=Heart Lung Circ |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=186\u201399 |date=June 2008 |pmid=18262841 |doi=10.1016/j.hlc.2007.10.019 |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Feldman M.D.|first=Ted |author2=Elyse Foster |author3=Donald G.
