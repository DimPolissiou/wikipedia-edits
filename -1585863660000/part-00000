Their suicide is discussed in brief at the very beginning of the story, and then followed by an introduction to the characters and their daily lives.\n\nThe focus of the story takes place across three days, beginning on February 26, and ending on February 28, 1936. On the morning of the 26th, the lieutenant leaves in a hurry to the sound of a bugle; he does not return until the evening of the 28th. When he does return, he tells his wife of the mutiny in the army ranks, and that the following morning, he will be in command of a unit ordered to attack the mutineers. Most of these mutineers are friends of his.\n\nUnable to choose between loyalty to the Emperor and loyalty to his comrades, he informs his wife that he will kill himself that evening, and she immediately requests to accompany him in his endeavour. He asks her to be a witness to his own suicide, and she agrees.\n\nThe lieutenant kills himself by ''[[seppuku]]'' later that same evening; this is described in a violent, lyrical display, typical of Mishima's literary style.\n\nThe writing reflects on the interlacing of mundanity and beauty, as when the intensity of passion that the husband and wife share for one another is related to the description of the couple in the photograph taken at their wedding, a recurring reference throughout the story.\n\n==Significance==\n\"Patriotism\" was written in the autumn of 1960, shortly after the [[Anpo]] disturbances, which were said to have prompted Mishima's public turn towards right-wing politics. A [[Patriotism (film)|film of the same title]] was released in 1966, co-directed by Yukio Mishima and Masaki Domoto.\n\nMishima later placed it together with the play ''[[Toka no Kiku]]'' and ''[[Eirei no Koe]]'' in a single volume, the ''Ni Ni Roku Trilogy''.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Yukio Mishima}}\n\n[[Category:1960 short stories]]\n[[Category:Short stories by Yukio Mishima]]\n[[Category:Shinchosha books]]\n\n[[ja:\u6182\u56fd]]\n", "text_old": "{{Refimprove|date=December 2011}}\n{{Infobox short story | <!-- See [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Novels]] or [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Books]] -->\n| name          = Patriotism\n| title_orig    = Y\u016bkoku\n| translator    = Geoffrey W.

He asks her to be a witness to his own suicide, and she agrees.\n\nThe lieutenant kills himself by ''[[seppuku]]'' later that same evening; this is described in a violent, lyrical display, typical of Mishima's literary style.\n\nThe writing reflects on the interlacing of mundanity and beauty, as when the intensity of passion that the husband and wife share for one another is related to the description of the couple in the photograph taken at their wedding, a recurring reference throughout the story.\n\n==Significance==\n\"Patriotism\" was written in the autumn of 1960, shortly after the [[Anpo]] disturbances, which were said to have prompted Mishima's public turn towards right-wing politics. A [[Patriotism (film)|film of the same title]] was released in 1966, co-directed by Yukio Mishima and Masaki Domoto.\n\nMishima later placed it together with the play ''[[Toka no Kiku]]'' and ''[[Eirei no Koe]]'' in a single volume, the ''Ni Ni Roku Trilogy''.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Yukio Mishima}}\n\n[[Category:1960 short stories]]\n[[Category:Works by Yukio Mishima]]\n[[Category:Shinchosha books]]\n\n[[ja:\u6182\u56fd]]\n", "name_user": "I grieve in stereo", "label": "safe", "comment": "Moving fromCategory:Works by Yukio MishimatoCategory:Short stories by Yukio MishimausingCat-a-lot", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriotism_(short_story)"}

the 2019 UK general election and the UK leaving the EU in January 2020, Another Europe is Possible has been criticised for contributing to Labour's defeat.

The day after the 2019 general election result, the ''[[Morning Star (British newspaper)|Morning Star]]''  published an editorial holding responsible 'groups like another Europe Is Possible' for Labour's defeat <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://morningstaronline.co.uk/article/b/why-we-lost-how-we-win|title=Why we lost, how we win|last=Friday|last2=December 13|date=2019-12-13|website=Morning Star|language=en|access-date=2020-02-29|last3=2019}}</ref>.\n\nTopics associated with Another Europe is Possible, such as the holding of a second referendum concerning the UK's relationship with the EU, have received significant criticism in outlets for political commentary.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/14/second-referendum-could-break-democracy</ref><ref>https://www.politico.eu/article/a-2nd-brexit-referendum-would-be-undemocratic-michael-gove/</ref> Another Europe is Possible has also received direct criticism on the 'World Socialist Website', with writer Julie Hyland stating that \" it is where apologists for the EU parade as \u201cprogressives\u201d, and specifically claiming that the organisation \" does not represent working people, but a section of the upper middle class\u2014personified by Varoufakis\u2014who are significant beneficiaries of the EU\".<ref>https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2016/06/07/euro-j07.html</ref> In a February 2019 letter, [[Unite the Union]] claimed that Another Europe is Possible had misrepresented the union's general secretary Len McCluskey regarding his discussions with then UK Prime Minister [[Theresa May]] stating that: \u201cUnite activists for the most part know better than to believe media rumours about their union, and we urge Another Europe is Possible to take the same sceptical approach.\u201d.<ref>https://unitetheunion.org/news-events/news/2019/february/unite-responds-to-misleading-letter-from-another-europe-is-possible/</ref>\n\nIn an article for [[New Statesman]], journalist Anoosh Chakelian suggested that Another Europe is Possible, along with a similar group 'For Our Future's Sake', recieved criticism because \"both groups have the same problem that other figures on the left, including young Labour members and Momentum activists, are not sympathetic to attacks on Corbyn regardless of how they feel about Brexit. Corbyn represents the socially liberal values they endorse, and they would prefer to see a purely anti-hard Brexit, anti-Tory approach.\"<ref>https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2018/06/why-everyone-hating-these-pro-remain-campaign-groups</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n== External links ==\n\n{{Portal bar|Society|United Kingdom|Brexit|Current events}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Another Europe is Possible}}\n\n[[Category:Brexit]]\n[[Category:Advocacy groups in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Political campaigns in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:2016 establishments in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:2016 in British politics]]\n[[Category:2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum]]\n[[Category:Brexit\u2013related advocacy groups in the United Kingdom]]\n", "name_user": "Boredintheevening", "label": "safe", "comment": "Rephrased introduction", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Another_Europe_is_Possible"}
