Wagle sought an ambassadorship to Ireland, Belize, or Belgium, or other State Department positions.

Wagle wrote, \"I'm thinking it's an excellent time,\" to leave Kansas politics while requesting that the operative forward her cover letter and resume which included Ruffin as a reference, to an administration official. The request followed ten days after Wagle voted to establish an avenue for racetrack casinos to operate in Kansas, a change sought by Ruffin, the owner of both Wichita's Greyhound Park and [[The Woodlands (race track)|The Woodlands]] racetrack in [[Kansas City, Kansas]].

Tax fairness and tax equity is a top concern for Senator Wagle.\" When interviewed, Ruffin said Wagle would make a good U.S. senator, dismissing the contention that her position change regarding expanded gaming led to his support. Wagle's pitch for such an ambassadorial post came weeks after Wichita Republican congressman [[Mike Pompeo]] received U.S. Senate approval as [[United States Secretary of State]] in April 2018. Wagle's campaign spokesman said Pompeo did not have a role in promoting her candidacy to the White House: \"While she does not recall speaking to Secretary Pompeo about her interest in serving in the Administration, she did reach out to the President's team and some of their mutual friends, including Phil Ruffin, in this process.\"<ref name=abortion/>\n\n===Other political involvement===\nWagle served as a delegate to the [[1996 Republican National Convention]].

He played [[college football]] at [[Kent State Golden Flashes football|Kent State]] and the [[College of San Mateo]] as a [[quarterback]]. He was drafted by the Patriots in the seventh round of the [[2009 NFL Draft]]. Edelman primarily plays on offense and as a punt returner; he has also been pressed into service as a [[cornerback]] at times when the Patriots have been shorthanded on defense.\n\nEdelman is one of the most productive receivers in post-season history, ranking second overall (behind [[Jerry Rice]]) in both post-season receiving yards and post-season receptions.  He has played in four Super Bowls ([[Super Bowl XLVI|XLVI]], [[Super Bowl XLIX|XLIX]], [[Super Bowl LI|LI]] and [[Super Bowl LIII|LIII]]). In each of the last three, he led all wide receivers in receiving yards. He was named [[Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award|Super Bowl MVP]] for Super Bowl LIII, in which he had 10 catches for 141 yards receiving, more than half of his team's total receiving yardage. He holds the Super Bowl records for career punt returns (8) and first-half receptions in a single game (7).\n\n==Early years==\nEdelman was born in [[Redwood City, California]], to Angela (n\u00e9e Gole) and Frank Edelman, a mechanic who owns an A-1 Auto Tech.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/12659571 |title=Julian Edelman enjoys his moment |date=February 19, 2015 |website=ESPN.com}}</ref> He has two siblings, Jason and Nicole.<ref>[http://www.patriots.com/team/roster/Julian-Edelman/1f41cf38-740b-4d2a-9109-7e13b48567e7 Julian Edelman profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120131230846/http://www.patriots.com/team/roster/Julian-Edelman/1f41cf38-740b-4d2a-9109-7e13b48567e7 |date=January 31, 2012 }}, Patriots.com; accessed November 6, 2015.</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://search.ancestry.com/search/db.aspx?dbid=5247 |title=California Birth Index, 1905\u20131995 |publisher=Ancestry |access-date=February 2, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2014/01/16/julian-edelman-took-back-road-nfl/Qbv5QnIQh9BpRn9ZetrSRO/story.html |title=Julian Edelman took the 'back road' to the NFL |website=BostonGlobe.com |access-date=April 9, 2015}}</ref> Originally raised as a [[Christians|Christian]], his ancestry includes [[Greeks|Greek]], [[English people|English]], [[Scottish people|Scottish]], Irish, [[Ashkenazi Jewish]], and [[Germans|German]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://njjewishnews.com/kaplanskorner/2009/09/21/edelman-mot/ |title=Edelman MOT? \u00bb Kaplan's Korner on Jews and Sports |date=September 21, 2009 |website=Njjewishnews.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108212449/http://njjewishnews.com/kaplanskorner/2009/09/21/edelman-mot/ |archive-date=November 8, 2014 |access-date=January 18, 2017}}</ref> His mother was born in [[Kitchener, Ontario]], Canada, to German parents who had lived in [[Belgium]].<ref name=\"relnt1\">Stated in ''Relentless: A Memoir'', Julian Edelman, 2017, Hachette Books</ref>\n\nHe was the quarterback for [[Woodside High School (California)|Woodside High School]] in [[Woodside, California]], and as a senior, he led the Wildcats to a 13\u20130 record in 2004.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.maxpreps.com/high-schools/woodside-wildcats-(woodside,ca)/football-fall-04/schedule.htm |title=Schedule \u2013 Woodside Wildcats 2004 Football (CA) |website=www.maxpreps.com |access-date=December 11, 2018}}</ref> During his high school career, Edelman had 2,237 yards and 29 touchdowns passing, in addition to 964 yards and 13 [[touchdown]]s rushing.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Yang |first=Nicole |url=https://www.boston.com/sports/new-england-patriots/2017/10/24/5-things-we-learned-from-julian-edelmans-new-memoir-relentless |title=5 things we learned from Julian Edelman's new memoir 'Relentless' |date=October 24, 2017 |work=Boston.com |access-date=December 25, 2017 |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==College career==\nAfter high school, Edelman spent a year attending the [[College of San Mateo]].

He played [[college football]] at [[Kent State Golden Flashes football|Kent State]] and the [[College of San Mateo]] as a [[quarterback]]. He was drafted by the Patriots in the seventh round of the [[2009 NFL Draft]]. Edelman primarily plays on offense and as a punt returner; he has also been pressed into service as a [[cornerback]] at times when the Patriots have been shorthanded on defense.\n\nEdelman is one of the most productive receivers in post-season history, ranking second overall (behind [[Jerry Rice]]) in both post-season receiving yards and post-season receptions.  He has played in four Super Bowls ([[Super Bowl XLVI|XLVI]], [[Super Bowl XLIX|XLIX]], [[Super Bowl LI|LI]] and [[Super Bowl LIII|LIII]]). In each of the last three, he led all wide receivers in receiving yards. He was named [[Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award|Super Bowl MVP]] for Super Bowl LIII, in which he had 10 catches for 141 yards receiving, more than half of his team's total receiving yardage. He holds the Super Bowl records for career punt returns (8) and first-half receptions in a single game (7).\n\n==Early years==\nEdelman was born in [[Redwood City, California]], to Angela (n\u00e9e Gole) and Frank Edelman, a mechanic who owns an A-1 Auto Tech.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/12659571 |title=Julian Edelman enjoys his moment |date=February 19, 2015 |website=ESPN.com}}</ref> He has two siblings, Jason and Nicole.<ref>[http://www.patriots.com/team/roster/Julian-Edelman/1f41cf38-740b-4d2a-9109-7e13b48567e7 Julian Edelman profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120131230846/http://www.patriots.com/team/roster/Julian-Edelman/1f41cf38-740b-4d2a-9109-7e13b48567e7 |date=January 31, 2012 }}, Patriots.com; accessed November 6, 2015.</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://search.ancestry.com/search/db.aspx?dbid=5247 |title=California Birth Index, 1905\u20131995 |publisher=Ancestry |access-date=February 2, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2014/01/16/julian-edelman-took-back-road-nfl/Qbv5QnIQh9BpRn9ZetrSRO/story.html |title=Julian Edelman took the 'back road' to the NFL |website=BostonGlobe.com |access-date=April 9, 2015}}</ref> Originally raised as a [[Christians|Christian]], his ancestry includes [[Greeks|Greek]], [[English people|English]], [[Scottish people|Scottish]], Irish, [[Ashkenazi Jewish]], and [[Germans|German]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://njjewishnews.com/kaplanskorner/2009/09/21/edelman-mot/ |title=Edelman MOT? \u00bb Kaplan's Korner on Jews and Sports |date=September 21, 2009 |website=Njjewishnews.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108212449/http://njjewishnews.com/kaplanskorner/2009/09/21/edelman-mot/ |archive-date=November 8, 2014 |access-date=January 18, 2017}}</ref> His mother was born in [[Kitchener, Ontario]], Canada, to German parents who had lived in [[Belgium]].<ref name=\"relnt1\">Stated in ''Relentless: A Memoir'', Julian Edelman, 2017, Hachette Books</ref>\n\nHe was the quarterback for [[Woodside High School (California)|Woodside High School]] in [[Woodside, California]], and as a senior, he led the Wildcats to a 13\u20130 record in 2004.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.maxpreps.com/high-schools/woodside-wildcats-(woodside,ca)/football-fall-04/schedule.htm |title=Schedule \u2013 Woodside Wildcats 2004 Football (CA) |website=www.maxpreps.com |access-date=December 11, 2018}}</ref> During his high school career, Edelman had 2,237 yards and 29 touchdowns passing, in addition to 964 yards and 13 [[touchdown]]s rushing.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Yang |first=Nicole |url=https://www.boston.com/sports/new-england-patriots/2017/10/24/5-things-we-learned-from-julian-edelmans-new-memoir-relentless |title=5 things we learned from Julian Edelman's new memoir 'Relentless' |date=October 24, 2017 |work=Boston.com |access-date=December 25, 2017 |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==College career==\nAfter high school, Edelman spent a year attending the [[College of San Mateo]].

Built by [[W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4]] [[Hietalahti shipyard|Helsinki shipyard]] in 1987 as a replacement for the aging ''Karhu''-class icebreakers, she and her sister ship [[Otso (icebreaker)|''Otso'']] were the first Finnish post-war icebreaker to be built without bow propellers.\n\nIn addition to icebreaker duties, ''Kontio'' has been fitted for oil spill response by the [[European Maritime Safety Agency]].\n\n== Development and construction ==\n\nIn the early 1980s, the [[Finnish National Board of Navigation]] began looking for a replacement for the aging ''Karhu''-class icebreakers [[Finnish icebreaker Karhu|''Karhu'']], [[Finnish icebreaker Murtaja (1959)|''Murtaja'']] and [[Sampo (1960 icebreaker)|''Sampo'']] which had been built in the late 1950s and were no longer wide enough to escort modern merchant ships.<ref name=\"sws\">Karhu II - A new-generation icebreaker. Shipping World & Shipbuilder, October 1985.</ref> Furthermore, the old icebreakers were expensive to operate and, despite their small size, required a relatively large crew of 53.<ref name=\"kaukiainen\">Kaukiainen (1992), page 330.</ref> The development of the new class of icebreakers, dubbed ''Karhu II'' in the preliminary papers, intensified when W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 opened [[Aker Arctic|a new ice model test facility]] in 1983. The first new icebreaker, ''Otso'', was ordered from [[W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4]] [[Hietalahti shipyard|Helsinki shipyard]] on 19 March 1984 with a price of [[Finnish markka|FIM]] 235 million and commissioned in January 1986.<ref name=\"sws\" /><ref>Uusi murtaja tilattu. Suomen Merenkulku 6/1984. Page 43.</ref> The second ship, identical to the first one, was ordered in December 1985 and delivered to the owners on 29 January 1987.<ref>Helsingin Sanomat, 31 January 1986.</ref> Her name, ''Kontio'', is one of the many [[epithet]]s for [[bear]] in the [[Finnish language]]. Afterwards, the three ''Karhu'' class icebreakers were decommissioned and sold.<ref name=\"kaukiainen\" />\n\nIn terms of performance, ''Kontio'' is identical to her sister ship ''Otso''. During extensive ice trials in the [[Bothnian Bay]] in March 1986, ''Otso'' was put through a series of test to determine her icebreaking capability. In a race against the 1975-built ''[[Urho (icebreaker)|Urho]]'' in {{convert|0.8|m|in|adj=on}} level ice, ''Otso'' beat the older but more powerful four-propelled icebreaker by a ship's length,<ref name=\"turunen37-39\">Turunen (2011), pages 37\u201339.</ref> showing that in terms of ice resistance the new icebreaker was superior to her predecessor.<ref name=\"kaukiainen\" /><ref name=\"navigator6-1986\" /> In {{convert|40|cm|in|adj=on}} ice, she could easily maintain a speed of {{convert|16|kn}} and small ice ridges along the way appeared to be of no consequence to the vessel. However, the strength of the new icebreaker was put to the ultimate test when she encountered a large pressure ridge reaching all the way to the seafloor some {{convert|20|m|ft|0}} below the surface. After preparations, ''Otso'' was accelerated to a speed of {{convert|14|kn}} and rammed into the ridge at full power. Since the new icebreaker had a smooth inclined [[Stem (ship)|stem]] and lacked the bow propellers of her predecessors, she rode up the ridge and began listing to the port side as the hull rose from the water. After coming to a stop, ''Otso'' slid back by herself without utilizing the engines, and the ridge was penetrated on the second charge.<ref name=\"motorship\" /><ref name=\"turunen37-39\" /> The robustness of the ship and its propulsion system were further proven when the icebreaker was backed into a ridge at {{convert|10|kn}} \"to prove to the customer it doesn't break\".<ref name=\"popularmechanics\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=KOQDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA56 Icebreakers!] Popular Mechanics, February 1989. {{retrieved | accessdate=2012-10-14}}</ref>\n\n== Technical details ==\n\n=== General characteristics ===\n\nAlthough the {{convert|99|m|ft|0|adj=on}} ''Kontio'' is slightly shorter than her predecessors ''Urho'' and ''Sisu'', she is slightly wider and was, at the time of her delivery, the widest subarctic icebreaker in the world with a beam of {{convert|24.2|m|ft}}.<ref name=\"sws\" /> However, with a maximum draft of {{convert|8|m|ft}} and a minimum operating draft of only {{convert|7.3|m|ft}}, ''Kontio'' is able to escort ships to shallower ports than her predecessors.<ref name=\"navigator6-1986\">Telakoiden vaikein vuosi menossa. Navigator 6/1986.</ref> The displacement of the icebreaker is 9,130 tons.<ref name=\"arctia\" />\n\nIn many ways, ''Otso'' and ''Kontio'' were a significant departure from the traditional Finnish icebreaker design. The extended [[bridge wing]]s on top of the stylish superstructure feature full-depth all-round windows that provide almost 360 degree visibility from the main steering position, which has been moved to the starboard bridge wing from the centerline.<ref name=\"motorship\" /><ref name=\"smk2-85\" /> Furthermore, the traditional colours dating back to the [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russian]] era, yellow and black, were replaced with the colors of the [[flag of Finland]], blue and white. Due to the extensive use of advanced automation, which allowed everything ranging from starting and stopping the main engines to raising and lowering the flag to be done remotely from the bridge, ''Otso'' and ''Kontio'' had the smallest crew among Finnish state-owned icebreakers when she entered service in 1986.<ref name=\"kaukiainen\" /> Later her crew has been further reduced to 20.<ref name=\"arctia\" /> ''Kontio'' was also the first icebreaker in which the [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]]s, unusable in ice-infested waters, were replaced with inflatable life rafts that could be lowered on the ice.<ref name=\"smk2-85\" /> However, lifeboats were fitted when the icebreaker was equipped for oil spill response.\n\nWhile ''Kontio'' holds the highest [[Finnish-Swedish ice class]], 1A Super,<ref name=\"arctia\" /> it has hardly any meaning for icebreakers which are of considerably stronger build than merchant ships operating in their care. Coated with low-friction [[Inerta 160|Inerta{{nbsp}}160]] epoxy paint, the hull plating has thickness of over {{convert|30|mm|in}} in the bow and the waterline is protected by an [[Explosion welding|explosion welded]] [[stainless steel]] compound plating that further reduces ice friction and resists abrasion.<ref name=\"motorship\" /><ref name=\"popularmechanics\" /> [[Galvanic corrosion]] is prevented by active [[cathodic protection]].<ref name=\"arctia\" />\n\n=== Power and propulsion ===\n\nLike all modern Finnish icebreakers, ''Kontio'' has a [[diesel-electric#Ships|diesel-electric]] propulsion system. It utilizes the so-called power plant principle in which the main generators provide electricity for all shipboard consumers through a common [[busbar]]. Her main generators, four [[V16 engine|16-cylinder]] W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 Vasa 16V32 four-stroke medium-speed [[diesel engine]]s producing 5,460{{nbsp}}kW each and driving 7,540 kVA Kymi-[[Str\u00f6mberg (company)|Str\u00f6mberg]] [[alternator]]s, are located on the upper deck beneath the helicopter platform.<ref name=\"motorship\" /><ref name=\"cyclo\">Cycloconverters for the new icebreaker from Kymmene-Str\u00f6mberg.

Suomen Merenkulku 2/1985. Pages 6\u20138.</ref> The uncommon location of the engine room was chosen to improve the seakeeping characteristics of the icebreaker by moving the [[center of gravity]] higher to calm the ship's motions in heavy weather. In addition, the maintenance of the main engines is easier as the heavy engine components can be handled with the ship's main crane and the [[heavy fuel oil]] tanks could be placed amidships to reduce the probability of an oil spill in case of grounding.<ref name=\"navigator6-1986\" /> {{Asof|2013}}, ''Kontio'' and her sister ship ''Otso'' are the only Finnish icebreakers running on heavy fuel oil which, being the cheapest fuel available, reduces operational costs of the icebreaker.<ref>[http://www.demari.fi/politiikka/uutiset/15683-arctia-shippingin-luottamusmiehet-ruotsalaisille-annettu-etua Arctia Shippingin luottamusmiehet: Ruotsalaisille annettu etua].

Although electrical propulsion had already been used in Finnish icebreakers for almost five decades due to its flexibility and good torque characteristics at low propeller speeds, the older vessels had [[direct current]] (DC) propulsion motors which were very heavy and bulky at such power levels. Although it would have been possible to use two smaller DC motors in tandem, recent advances in drive and control technology as well as excellent experiences from a prototype installation on board the Finnish research vessel [[Katarina (1953 ship)|''Aranda'']] were in favor of the new type of propulsion system. As a result, ''Otso'' and ''Kontio'' were fitted with two Kymi-Str\u00f6mberg [[Synchronous motor|synchronous]] AC motors rated at 7,500{{nbsp}}kW. The maximum power is available at propeller speeds ranging from 115 to 220{{nbsp}}rpm to both directions and at lower speeds the propulsion motors are capable of providing 130% of the rated torque to prevent the four-bladed stainless steel propellers from jamming in severe ice conditions.<ref name=\"motorship\" /><ref name=\"cyclo\" /> The [[bollard pull]] of ''Kontio'' is 160{{nbsp}}tons.<ref name=\"arctia\" />\n\n[[File:Kontio towing.jpg|thumb|left|''Kontio'' immobilized by pack ice while towing a cargo ship, a problem more likely to occur when the icebreaker has no bow propellers.]]\nPrior to the construction of the new vessels, all Finnish state-owned icebreakers built after the [[Second World War]] had been fitted with two bow propellers to reduce the friction between ice and the hull of the vessel in difficult ice conditions. However, the quad-shaft propulsion system was expensive to build and maintain, and the forward propeller bossings considerably increased the resistance of the ship. Although Finnish icebreaker captains voiced their concerns about the maneuverability and icebreaking capability of a vessel without bow propellers especially in heavy ice ridges and at crawling speeds,<ref name=\"smk4-86\">Otso osoittautui kelpo murtajaksi. Suomen Merenkulku 4/1986. Pages 22\u201324</ref> extensive model testing at W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4's new ice model test basin showed that the ice resistance could be reduced by replacing the bow propellers with a \"clean\" hull and adopting an air bubbling system to lubricate the hull.<ref name=\"motorship\" /> The patented [[W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 Air Bubbling System]] (WABS) onboard ''Otso'' and ''Kontio'' consists of three compressors with a combined output of 1,900{{nbsp}}kW that pump air through 46 nozzles located below the waterline on both sides of the vessel. At low speeds, the system can also be used for manoeuvering. In addition, she has large ballast tanks and high-capacity pumps that can be used for rapid heeling and trimming to release the icebreaker if she is immobilized by compressive pack ice.<ref name=\"smk2-85\" />\n\nLike her sister ship ''Otso'', ''Kontio'' has also been retrofitted with a [[bow thruster]] to assist manoeuvering.<ref>H\u00e4kkinen, P.

Built by [[W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4]] [[Hietalahti shipyard|Helsinki shipyard]] in 1987 as a replacement for the aging ''Karhu''-class icebreakers, she and her sister ship [[Otso (icebreaker)|''Otso'']] were the first Finnish post-war icebreaker to be built without bow propellers.\n\nIn addition to icebreaker duties, ''Kontio'' has been fitted for oil spill response by the [[European Maritime Safety Agency]].\n\n== Development and construction ==\n\nIn the early 1980s, the [[Finnish National Board of Navigation]] began looking for a replacement for the aging ''Karhu''-class icebreakers [[Finnish icebreaker Karhu|''Karhu'']], [[Finnish icebreaker Murtaja (1959)|''Murtaja'']] and [[Sampo (1960 icebreaker)|''Sampo'']] which had been built in the late 1950s and were no longer wide enough to escort modern merchant ships.<ref name=\"sws\">Karhu II - A new-generation icebreaker. Shipping World & Shipbuilder, October 1985.</ref> Furthermore, the old icebreakers were expensive to operate and, despite their small size, required a relatively large crew of 53.<ref name=\"kaukiainen\">Kaukiainen (1992), page 330.</ref> The development of the new class of icebreakers, dubbed ''Karhu II'' in the preliminary papers, intensified when W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 opened [[Aker Arctic|a new ice model test facility]] in 1983. The first new icebreaker, ''Otso'', was ordered from [[W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4]] [[Hietalahti shipyard|Helsinki shipyard]] on 19 March 1984 with a price of [[Finnish markka|FIM]] 235 million and commissioned in January 1986.<ref name=\"sws\" /><ref>Uusi murtaja tilattu.

Afterwards, the three ''Karhu'' class icebreakers were decommissioned and sold.<ref name=\"kaukiainen\" />\n\nIn terms of performance, ''Kontio'' is identical to her sister ship ''Otso''. During extensive ice trials in the [[Bothnian Bay]] in March 1986, ''Otso'' was put through a series of test to determine her icebreaking capability. In a race against the 1975-built ''[[Urho (icebreaker)|Urho]]'' in {{convert|0.8|m|in|adj=on}} level ice, ''Otso'' beat the older but more powerful four-propelled icebreaker by a ship's length,<ref name=\"turunen37-39\">Turunen (2011), pages 37\u201339.</ref> showing that in terms of ice resistance the new icebreaker was superior to her predecessor.<ref name=\"kaukiainen\" /><ref name=\"navigator6-1986\" /> In {{convert|40|cm|in|adj=on}} ice, she could easily maintain a speed of {{convert|16|kn}} and small ice ridges along the way appeared to be of no consequence to the vessel. However, the strength of the new icebreaker was put to the ultimate test when she encountered a large pressure ridge reaching all the way to the seafloor some {{convert|20|m|ft|0}} below the surface. After preparations, ''Otso'' was accelerated to a speed of {{convert|14|kn}} and rammed into the ridge at full power. Since the new icebreaker had a smooth inclined [[Stem (ship)|stem]] and lacked the bow propellers of her predecessors, she rode up the ridge and began listing to the port side as the hull rose from the water. After coming to a stop, ''Otso'' slid back by herself without utilizing the engines, and the ridge was penetrated on the second charge.<ref name=\"motorship\" /><ref name=\"turunen37-39\" /> The robustness of the ship and its propulsion system were further proven when the icebreaker was backed into a ridge at {{convert|10|kn}} \"to prove to the customer it doesn't break\".<ref name=\"popularmechanics\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=KOQDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA56 Icebreakers!] Popular Mechanics, February 1989. {{retrieved | accessdate=2012-10-14}}</ref>\n\n== Technical details ==\n\n=== General characteristics ===\n\nAlthough the {{convert|99|m|ft|0|adj=on}} ''Kontio'' is slightly shorter than her predecessors ''Urho'' and ''Sisu'', she is slightly wider and was, at the time of her delivery, the widest subarctic icebreaker in the world with a beam of {{convert|24.2|m|ft}}.<ref name=\"sws\" /> However, with a maximum draft of {{convert|8|m|ft}} and a minimum operating draft of only {{convert|7.3|m|ft}}, ''Kontio'' is able to escort ships to shallower ports than her predecessors.<ref name=\"navigator6-1986\">Telakoiden vaikein vuosi menossa. Navigator 6/1986.</ref> The displacement of the icebreaker is 9,130 tons.<ref name=\"arctia\" />\n\nIn many ways, ''Otso'' and ''Kontio'' were a significant departure from the traditional Finnish icebreaker design. The extended [[bridge wing]]s on top of the stylish superstructure feature full-depth all-round windows that provide almost 360 degree visibility from the main steering position, which has been moved to the starboard bridge wing from the centerline.<ref name=\"motorship\" /><ref name=\"smk2-85\" /> Furthermore, the traditional colours dating back to the [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russian]] era, yellow and black, were replaced with the colors of the [[flag of Finland]], blue and white. Due to the extensive use of advanced automation, which allowed everything ranging from starting and stopping the main engines to raising and lowering the flag to be done remotely from the bridge, ''Otso'' and ''Kontio'' had the smallest crew among Finnish state-owned icebreakers when she entered service in 1986.<ref name=\"kaukiainen\" /> Later her crew has been further reduced to 20.<ref name=\"arctia\" /> ''Kontio'' was also the first icebreaker in which the [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]]s, unusable in ice-infested waters, were replaced with inflatable life rafts that could be lowered on the ice.<ref name=\"smk2-85\" /> However, lifeboats were fitted when the icebreaker was equipped for oil spill response.\n\nWhile ''Kontio'' holds the highest [[Finnish-Swedish ice class]], 1A Super,<ref name=\"arctia\" /> it has hardly any meaning for icebreakers which are of considerably stronger build than merchant ships operating in their care. Coated with low-friction [[Inerta 160|Inerta{{nbsp}}160]] epoxy paint, the hull plating has thickness of over {{convert|30|mm|in}} in the bow and the waterline is protected by an [[Explosion welding|explosion welded]] [[stainless steel]] compound plating that further reduces ice friction and resists abrasion.<ref name=\"motorship\" /><ref name=\"popularmechanics\" /> [[Galvanic corrosion]] is prevented by active [[cathodic protection]].<ref name=\"arctia\" />\n\n=== Power and propulsion ===\n\nLike all modern Finnish icebreakers, ''Kontio'' has a [[diesel-electric#Ships|diesel-electric]] propulsion system.

Pages 6\u20138.</ref> The uncommon location of the engine room was chosen to improve the seakeeping characteristics of the icebreaker by moving the [[center of gravity]] higher to calm the ship's motions in heavy weather. In addition, the maintenance of the main engines is easier as the heavy engine components can be handled with the ship's main crane and the [[heavy fuel oil]] tanks could be placed amidships to reduce the probability of an oil spill in case of grounding.<ref name=\"navigator6-1986\" /> {{Asof|2013}}, ''Kontio'' and her sister ship ''Otso'' are the only Finnish icebreakers running on heavy fuel oil which, being the cheapest fuel available, reduces operational costs of the icebreaker.<ref>[http://www.demari.fi/politiikka/uutiset/15683-arctia-shippingin-luottamusmiehet-ruotsalaisille-annettu-etua Arctia Shippingin luottamusmiehet: Ruotsalaisille annettu etua].

Although electrical propulsion had already been used in Finnish icebreakers for almost five decades due to its flexibility and good torque characteristics at low propeller speeds, the older vessels had [[direct current]] (DC) propulsion motors which were very heavy and bulky at such power levels. Although it would have been possible to use two smaller DC motors in tandem, recent advances in drive and control technology as well as excellent experiences from a prototype installation on board the Finnish research vessel [[Katarina (1953 ship)|''Aranda'']] were in favor of the new type of propulsion system. As a result, ''Otso'' and ''Kontio'' were fitted with two Kymi-Str\u00f6mberg [[Synchronous motor|synchronous]] AC motors rated at 7,500{{nbsp}}kW. The maximum power is available at propeller speeds ranging from 115 to 220{{nbsp}}rpm to both directions and at lower speeds the propulsion motors are capable of providing 130% of the rated torque to prevent the four-bladed stainless steel propellers from jamming in severe ice conditions.<ref name=\"motorship\" /><ref name=\"cyclo\" /> The [[bollard pull]] of ''Kontio'' is 160{{nbsp}}tons.<ref name=\"arctia\" />\n\n[[File:Kontio towing.jpg|thumb|left|''Kontio'' immobilized by pack ice while towing a cargo ship, a problem more likely to occur when the icebreaker has no bow propellers.]]\nPrior to the construction of the new vessels, all Finnish state-owned icebreakers built after the [[Second World War]] had been fitted with two bow propellers to reduce the friction between ice and the hull of the vessel in difficult ice conditions. However, the quad-shaft propulsion system was expensive to build and maintain, and the forward propeller bossings considerably increased the resistance of the ship. Although Finnish icebreaker captains voiced their concerns about the maneuverability and icebreaking capability of a vessel without bow propellers especially in heavy ice ridges and at crawling speeds,<ref name=\"smk4-86\">Otso osoittautui kelpo murtajaksi.

However, after the early [[teething problem]]s and successful ice trials, the opinions changed and the performance of the \"Bubbler of the Bothnian Bay\" was generally deemed to be satisfactory.<ref name=\"smk4-86\" /> Over the years, ''Otso'' and her sister ship ''Kontio'' have proved to be very cost-efficient and for that reason they are the first Finnish state-owned icebreakers to be deployed for icebreaking in the [[Gulf of Bothnia]] every winter.<ref name=\"arctia\" />\n\nIn addition to icebreaking duties and, later, oil spill response preparedness, ''Kontio'' has been used for various different tasks. In July 2011, she participated in the sea trials of ''Dir'', an escort tug built in [[St. Petersburg]]. In the tests, the much smaller tug was attached to the stern of the icebreaker to determine its bollard pull while the icebreaker towed it at different speeds.<ref name=\"smu3\">[http://www.smu.fi/viestinta/nettijutut/jaanmurtaja-kontio-saattohinaaja/ J\u00e4\u00e4nmurtaja Kontio saattohinaajan testiajossa] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20130213084151/http://www.smu.fi/viestinta/nettijutut/jaanmurtaja-kontio-saattohinaaja/ |date=2013-02-13 }}.

Snyder|William Snyder]], [[Peter Shaffer]] and [[John Boorman]]. These attempts resulted in a couple of unproduced scripts, concept art and an animated short. Other filmmakers and producers to have had an interest in adapting Tolkien are said to include [[Walt Disney]], [[Forrest J Ackerman|Forrest Ackerman]], [[Denis O'Bell|Denis O'Dell]] (who considered [[Richard Lester]] to direct, but instead approached [[David Lean]], [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Michelangelo Antonioni|Michaelangelo Antonioni]]) and [[George Lucas]]. The rights to adapt Tolkien's works passed through the hands of several studios, having been briefly leased to [[Rembrandt Films|Rembrandt films]] before being sold perpetually to [[United Artists]]. In 1976, UA passed the rights to ''The Lord of the Rings'' (and a part of the rights to ''The Hobbit'') to [[Fantasy Films|Fantasy films]].\n\nIn 1977, an animated adaptation of ''[[The Hobbit (1977 film)|The Hobbit]]'' was produced as a TV special by [[Rankin/Bass Productions|Rankin and Bass]] (followed in 1980 by a TV animated adaptation of ''[[The Return of the King (1980 film)|The Return of the King]]''), and in 1978 [[Ralph Bakshi]] made an animated feature of the first half of ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''. While profitable, the film didn't make enough money to automatically warrant the sequel which would close the story, and an argument with producer [[Saul Zaentz]] led Bakshi to abandon the project. Several Tolkien-esque fantasy films were produced at the time, as well, including Boorman's ''[[Excalibur (film)|Excalibur]]'' and George Lucas' ''[[Willow (film)|Willow]]''.\n\nAt the time that Bakshi's film aired, a teenager Peter Jackson hadn't read the book, but \"heard the name\",<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061009173240/http://www.conlanpress.com/resources/peter_jackson_on_Tolkien_inspiration_2-6-04.mp3 |title=Peter Jackson, as quoted at the Egyptian Theater in Hollywood, on February 6, 2004. |last= |first= |date= |website=|url-status=live|access-date=}}</ref> and went to see the film: \"I liked the early part \u2013 it had some quaint sequences in Hobbiton, a creepy encounter with the Black Rider on the road, and a few quite good battle scenes \u2013 but then, about half way through, the storytelling became very disjointed and disorientating and I really didn't understand what was going on. However, what it did do was to make me want to read the book \u2013 if only to find out what happened!\"<ref>{{Cite book |last=Sibley |first=Brian |title=Peter Jackson: A Film-Maker's Journey |publisher= |year= |isbn= |location= |pages=6}}</ref> Jackson bought a tie-in paperback edition. He later read ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Silmarillion'', listened to the 1981 BBC radio adaptation, and read on some previous attempts to bring the piece to the screen.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XDsSr3sGSI&t=2369s |title=Peter Jackson Exeter interview, 2015 |last= |first= |date= |website=|url-status=live|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Pitch to Miramax ===\nIn 1995, while completing post-production on ''[[The Frighteners]]'', Jackson and Fran Walsh discussed making an original fantasy film, but couldn't think of a scenario that wasn't Tolkien-esque, and eventually decided to look up the film rights. They went to [[Harvey Weinstein]] from [[Miramax]], who got the rights from Saul Zaentz. Jackson knew it would take multiple films to do Tolkien justice,<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|last=Sibley|first=|title=A Filmmaker's Journey|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=36-40}}</ref> but initially pitched a single trilogy: one film based on ''The Hobbit'' and, if that would prove successful, two ''Lord of the Rings'' films shot back-to-back.<ref name=\":5\" /> Jackson began rereading The Hobbit, looking at illustrations and commissioning concept art from the book, but the rights eventually proved unattainable, having been split between Zaentz and United Artists. Harvey tried to the buy the studio's share of the rights, but was unsuccesful.\n\nWith the Hobbit postponed for a later prequel, Jackson proceeded with making two or more<ref name=\":6\" /> ''Lord of the Rings'' films: \"We pitched the idea of three films and Miramax didn't really want to take that risk, but we agreed on two.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ggVDYcvNxg |title=Peter Jackson interview with Charlie Rose, 2002 |last= |first= |date= |website=|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200228201928/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ggVDYcvNxg|archive-date=28 February 2020|access-date=}}</ref> He began writing the scripts with Walsh and [[Stephen Sinclair]], storyboard with [[Christian Rivers]] and discussing casting ideas with the Weinsteins. Meanwhile [[Weta Digital|WETA Digital]] began software development for the digital effects required,<ref name=\":0\" /> and  [[Weta Workshop|WETA Workshop]] were producing props and concept art. Sinclair later dropped from the project, but Jackson felt that some of his contributions survived into the finished scripts, particularly the middle film, ''The Two Towers'', for which he is credited.\n\n=== Move to New Line ===\nHowever, as the scripts took shape, it became clear that the budget required would exceed Miramax' capabilities. The Weinsteins suggested cutting the project to one film.<ref name=\":0\" /> Jackson inquired whether it could be around four-hours in duration, but Miramax insisted on two hours, suggesting major cuts to the story, which Jackson refused.

The films, which were released between 2012 and 2014, used much of the cast of ''The Lord of the Rings'', including [[Ian McKellen]], [[Andy Serkis]], [[Hugo Weaving]], [[Elijah Wood]], [[Ian Holm]], [[Christopher Lee]], [[Cate Blanchett]] and [[Orlando Bloom]] who reprised their roles. Most of the crew returned, as well, with Jackson directing, him and Walsh producing and Boyens co-writing. Ngila Dickson, Grant Major, Jim Rygiel and Ethan Van der Ryn dropped out from costume design, production design, animation and sound editing respectivelly, but were succeeded by their Lord of the Rings colleagues, Richard Taylor, Dan Hennah, Joe Letteri and Brent Burge. The only complete changes in the staff involved the change of gaffer, after [[Brian Bansgrove]] died between the trilogies, and stunt coordinator Glen Boswall replaced [[George Marshall Ruge]] who worked on ''Rings''. \n\nAlthough the ''Hobbit'' trilogy was commercially successful, it received mixed reviews from critics. However, the films did manage to add another seven Academy Award nominations to the series' tally, to an overall 37, and another win for the [[Scientific and Engineering Award]], resulting in the most nominations and wins for a six-part series.\n\n=== Amazon's ''The Lord of the Rings'' prequel series ===\n[[Amazon Studios]] discussed development of a series based on ''The Lord of the Rings'' with [[Warner Bros.

Snyder|William Snyder]], [[Peter Shaffer]] and [[John Boorman]]. These attempts resulted in a couple of unproduced scripts, concept art and an animated short. Other filmmakers and producers to have had an interest in adapting Tolkien are said to include [[Walt Disney]], [[Forrest J Ackerman|Forrest Ackerman]], [[Denis O'Bell|Denis O'Dell]] (who considered [[Richard Lester]] to direct, but instead approached [[David Lean]], [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Michelangelo Antonioni|Michaelangelo Antonioni]]) and [[George Lucas]]. The rights to adapt Tolkien's works passed through the hands of several studios, having been briefly leased to [[Rembrandt Films|Rembrandt films]] before being sold perpetually to [[United Artists]]. In 1976, UA passed the rights to ''The Lord of the Rings'' (and a part of the rights to ''The Hobbit'') to [[Fantasy Films|Fantasy films]].\n\nIn 1977, an animated adaptation of ''[[The Hobbit (1977 film)|The Hobbit]]'' was produced as a TV special by [[Rankin/Bass Productions|Rankin and Bass]] (followed in 1980 by a TV animated adaptation of ''[[The Return of the King (1980 film)|The Return of the King]]''), and in 1978 [[Ralph Bakshi]] made an animated feature of the first half of ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''. While profitable, the film didn't make enough money to automatically warrant the sequel which would close the story, and an argument with producer [[Saul Zaentz]] led Bakshi to abandon the project. Several Tolkien-esque fantasy films were produced at the time, as well, including Boorman's ''[[Excalibur (film)|Excalibur]]'' and George Lucas' ''[[Willow (film)|Willow]]''.\n\nAt the time that Bakshi's film aired, a teenager Peter Jackson hadn't read the book, but \"heard the name\",<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061009173240/http://www.conlanpress.com/resources/peter_jackson_on_Tolkien_inspiration_2-6-04.mp3 |title=Peter Jackson, as quoted at the Egyptian Theater in Hollywood, on February 6, 2004. |last= |first= |date= |website=|url-status=live|access-date=}}</ref> and went to see the film: \"I liked the early part \u2013 it had some quaint sequences in Hobbiton, a creepy encounter with the Black Rider on the road, and a few quite good battle scenes \u2013 but then, about half way through, the storytelling became very disjointed and disorientating and I really didn't understand what was going on.

They went to [[Harvey Weinstein]] from [[Miramax]], who got the rights from Saul Zaentz. Jackson knew it would take multiple films to do Tolkien justice,<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|last=Sibley|first=|title=A Filmmaker's Journey|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=36-40}}</ref> but initially pitched a single trilogy: one film based on ''The Hobbit'' and, if that would prove successful, two ''Lord of the Rings'' films shot back-to-back.<ref name=\":5\" /> Jackson began rereading The Hobbit, looking at illustrations and commissioning concept art from the book, but the rights eventually proved unattainable, having been split between Zaentz and United Artists. Harvey tried to the buy the studio's share of the rights, but was unsuccesful.\n\nWith the Hobbit postponed for a later prequel, Jackson proceeded with making two or more<ref name=\":6\" /> ''Lord of the Rings'' films: \"We pitched the idea of three films and Miramax didn't really want to take that risk, but we agreed on two.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ggVDYcvNxg |title=Peter Jackson interview with Charlie Rose, 2002 |last= |first= |date= |website=|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200228201928/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ggVDYcvNxg|archive-date=28 February 2020|access-date=}}</ref> He began writing the scripts with Walsh and [[Stephen Sinclair]], storyboard with [[Christian Rivers]] and discussing casting ideas with the Weinsteins. Meanwhile [[Weta Digital|WETA Digital]] began software development for the digital effects required,<ref name=\":0\" /> and  [[Weta Workshop|WETA Workshop]] were producing props and concept art. Sinclair later dropped from the project, but Jackson felt that some of his contributions survived into the finished scripts, particularly the middle film, ''The Two Towers'', for which he is credited.\n\n=== Move to New Line ===\nHowever, as the scripts took shape, it became clear that the budget required would exceed Miramax' capabilities. The Weinsteins suggested cutting the project to one film.<ref name=\":0\" /> Jackson inquired whether it could be around four-hours in duration, but Miramax insisted on two hours, suggesting major cuts to the story, which Jackson refused. Harvey Weinstein threatened to replace Jackson with screenwriter [[Hossein Amini]] and directors [[John Madden (director)|John Madden]] or [[Quentin Tarantino]]. Jackson believes this was an empty threat to get him to concede to making a one-film version himself. <ref name=\":7\" />\n\nHarvey eventually relented to putting the project on a turnaround, but the onerous conditions were meant to prevent the project from being taken up by another studio.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book |last= |first= |title=Peter Jackson: A Film-Maker's Journey |publisher= |year= |isbn= |location= |pages=39\u201340}}</ref> Jackson got an audience with New Line CEO [[Robert Shaye]], who accepted the project, but requested that it be expanded into a trilogy. Final Cut rights were shared contractually between Jackson and Bob Shaye, but there was never any interference in Jackson's cut.\n\n== Production ==\n{{Main|Production of The Lord of the Rings film series}}\n[[File:Alan Lee 2005.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Alan Lee (illustrator)|Alan Lee]], a Tolkien illustrator who assisted in the visual design, at [[63rd World Science Fiction Convention|Worldcon 2005]] in [[Glasgow]].]]\nJackson began [[storyboard]]ing and [[screenwriting]] the series with [[Christian Rivers]], [[Fran Walsh]] and [[Philippa Boyens]] in 1997 and assigned his crew to begin designing Middle-earth at the same time.<ref name=\"TTT Art\">{{Cite book |last=Russell |first=Gary |authorlink=Gary Russell |title=The Art of the Two Towers |publisher=Harper Collins |year=2003 |isbn=0-00-713564-5}}</ref> Jackson, Walsh, and Boyens did not write each film to correspond exactly to its respective book, opting instead to write a three-part [[Film adaptation|adaptation]] with some sequences missing, some sequences created from scratch, and some sequences moved from one area to another regardless of its placement in the books.

They include: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (video game)|The Two Towers]],'' [[The Lord of the Rings (pinball)|Pinball]], ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (video game)|The Return of the King]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age|The Third Age]]'', [[The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age (Game Boy Advance)|''The Third Age'' (GBA)]], ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Tactics|Tactics]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth|The Battle for Middle-earth]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II|The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II: The Rise of the Witch-king|The Battle for Middle-earth II: The Rise of the Witch-king]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Conquest|Conquest]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Aragorn's Quest|Aragorn's Quest]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North|War in the North]]'', ''[[Lego The Lord of the Rings (video game)|Lego The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[Guardians of Middle-earth]]'', ''[[Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor]]'', and ''[[Middle-earth: Shadow of War]]''.\n\n=== ''The Hobbit'' prequel trilogy ===\n{{Main|The Hobbit (film series)}}\nThe success of ''The Lord of the Rings'' trilogy led to Jackson directing a trilogy of prequels based on Tolkien's children's book ''[[The Hobbit]]''. The films, which were released between 2012 and 2014, used much of the cast of ''The Lord of the Rings'', including [[Ian McKellen]], [[Andy Serkis]], [[Hugo Weaving]], [[Elijah Wood]], [[Ian Holm]], [[Christopher Lee]], [[Cate Blanchett]] and [[Orlando Bloom]] who reprised their roles. Most of the crew returned, as well, with Jackson directing, him and Walsh producing and Boyens co-writing. Ngila Dickson, Grant Major, Jim Rygiel and Ethan Van der Ryn dropped out from costume design, production design, animation and sound editing respectivelly, but were succeeded by their Lord of the Rings colleagues, Richard Taylor, Dan Hennah, Joe Letteri and Brent Burge. The only complete changes in the staff involved the change of gaffer, after [[Brian Bansgrove]] died between the trilogies, and stunt coordinator Glen Boswall replaced [[George Marshall Ruge]] who worked on ''Rings''. \n\nAlthough the ''Hobbit'' trilogy was commercially successful, it received mixed reviews from critics. However, the films did manage to add another seven Academy Award nominations to the series' tally, to an overall 37, and another win for the [[Scientific and Engineering Award]], resulting in the most nominations and wins for a six-part series.\n\n=== Amazon's ''The Lord of the Rings'' prequel series ===\n[[Amazon Studios]] discussed development of a series based on ''The Lord of the Rings'' with [[Warner Bros.

At that time, racing tires were either [[Slick tire|slick tires]] made with the [[cross ply]] technique (very wide tyres with a reduced sidewall height), or [[radial tire]], which were too narrow to withstand the Stratos' power and did not provide enough grip.

At that time, racing tires were either [[Slick tire|slick tires]] made with the [[cross ply]] technique (very wide tyres with a reduced sidewall height), or [[radial tire]], which were too narrow to withstand the Stratos' power and did not provide enough grip.

Built in 1926 by [[P. Smit Jr. Shipbuilding and Machine Factory]] in [[Rotterdam]], Netherlands, she was the last and largest steam-powered state-owned icebreaker of Finland. After two decades of successful service, ''J\u00e4\u00e4karhu'' was handed over to the Soviet Union as [[Finnish war reparations to the Soviet Union|war reparation]] in 1945 and renamed '''''Sibiryakov'''''. She remained in service until the 1970s and was broken up in 1972.\n\n== Background and construction ==\n\n[[File:J\u00e4\u00e4karhu trials.jpg|thumb|left|''J\u00e4\u00e4karhu'' leaving for sea trials in Rotterdam.]]\n\nWhen the [[Treaty of Tartu (Russian\u2013Finnish)|Treaty of Tartu]] was signed on 14 October 1920, Finland agreed to return the Russian icebreakers that the [[White Guard (Finland)|Finnish White Guard]] had seized during the [[Finnish Civil War|Civil War]] in 1918. As a result, the largest and most powerful state-owned icebreaker of Finland at that time, [[Suur T\u00f5ll (icebreaker)|''W\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen'']], was handed over to Estonia in 1922. Since both the size of the ships calling at the Finnish winter ports and the amount of exported goods, especially forest products, had increased considerably since the [[First World War]], there was a definite need for a large and powerful icebreaker. One of the key issues was the beam of the existing icebreakers, {{convert|14|m|ft}}, which was not enough for the new ships used to transport goods across the Atlantic Ocean.<ref name=\"laurell133-139\">Laurell 1992, pp. 133\u2013139.</ref>\n\nIn 1923, the state allocated FIM 10 million for the design and development of a new icebreaker based on the experiences gained during the four years that ''W\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen'' had spent under the Finnish flag. The basic design of the new vessel, which was to have a beam of at least {{convert|18|m|ft}}, was awarded to experienced Finnish naval architects [[K. Albin Johansson]] and [[Ossian Tybeck]].<ref name=\"laurell140-151\" />\n\nBy June 1923, bids ranging from [[Finnish markka|FIM]] 20.2 to 35.5 million had been received from 24 shipyards representing eight nationalities. The most expensive offer was received from the Finnish [[Sandvikens Skeppsdocka och Mekaniska Verkstad|Sandvikens Skeppsdocka och Mekaniska Verkstads Ab]] that was already building another new icebreaker, [[Voima (1924 icebreaker)|''Voima'']], in Helsinki. In the end, the contract was awarded to the Dutch shipbuilder P. Smit Jr. Shipbuilding and Machine Factory from Rotterdam. The shipyard had recently constructed four ice-strengthened ships for the [[Finland Steamship Company]] and the technical director of the company had personally spent several weeks on board the Finnish icebreaker [[Sampo (1898 icebreaker)|''Sampo'']] during the past winter.<ref name=\"laurell140-151\" />\n\nThe contract for the construction of a new icebreaker was signed on 17 April 1924 after the Dutch government and the town council of Rotterdam agreed to subsidize the construction costs by 175,000 [[Dutch guilder]]s, bringing the final cost to \u01921,563,000 (FIM 26,000,000). She was launched on 26 August 1925<ref name=\"dutch_magazines\">Nieuwe Rotterdamsche Courant (26 August 1925 and 17 January 1926) and Het Centrum (24 December 1925).

YLE, 19 March 2012. {{retrieved|accessdate=21 May 2012}}</ref> As the new icebreaker was being built, Captain [[Johan Rosqvist]], who has previously commanded ''Sampo'', was selected as the first captain of the new icebreaker, and in the summer of 1925 he travelled to Rotterdam together with a chief engineer and a second engineer to supervise the construction and outfitting of his new ship.<ref name=\"laurell140-151\" />\n\nOn 13 January 1926 ''J\u00e4\u00e4karhu'' was ready for first sea trials in the [[North Sea]]. Although there were still issues with the oil-fired boilers by late February, it was agreed to take the delivery of the new icebreaker on 2 March 1926 and solve the problems later as the winter of 1926 had turned out to be very severe. Despite the best efforts of existing Finnish state-owned icebreakers, the ice conditions in the Gulf of Finland and the Sea of \u00c5land were extremely difficult and vast pack ice fields closed off the shipping lanes outside the island of [[Ut\u00f6, Finland|Ut\u00f6]] at the edge of the [[Archipelago Sea]].<ref name=\"laurell140-151\" /><ref name=\"ramsay321-324\" />\n\nAlthough sometimes called the largest and most powerful icebreaker in the world by the press in the 1920s, ''J\u00e4\u00e4karhu'' was no match for the Soviet polar icebreakers [[Icebreaker Yermak|''Yermak'']] and [[Krasin (1916 icebreaker)|''Svyatogor'']] that had nearly twice the displacement and over twice the power of the Finnish icebreaker. However, as a Baltic escort icebreaker she was considered better than the giants and was often compared with the Soviet icebreaker [[Lenin (1916 icebreaker)|''Lenin'']], which was roughly of the same size and was considered a very successful design.<ref name=\"ramsay321-324\">Ramsay 1949, p. 320\u2013324.</ref>\n\n== Career ==\n\n=== Early career ===\n\n[[File:Jaakarhu 1920s.jpg|thumb|left|''J\u00e4\u00e4karhu'' in the port of [[Hanko]].]]\n\n''J\u00e4\u00e4karhu'' left Rotterdam on 3 March 1926. When the new icebreaker arrived in Finland on 7 March, she was welcomed by a number of icebound ships outside Ut\u00f6. After ''Sampo'' had arrived from [[Hanko]] with the Minister of Commerce and Industry, [[Tyko Reinikka]], other representatives of the state, and members of the press, the newest and largest state-owned icebreaker demonstrated her power by easily overcoming the notorious pack ice fields surrounding the island and escorting a convoy of three merchant ships to the open seas.<ref name=\"ramsay321-324\" /> After spending her first winter escorting ships in the Gulf of Finland, ''J\u00e4\u00e4karhu'' arrived in Helsinki on 27 April 1926. In July she was drydocked in [[Liep\u0101ja]], Latvia, where her bottom was repainted.<ref name=\"laurell140-151\" />\n\nIn 1926, ''J\u00e4\u00e4karhu'' became the first Finnish icebreaker to adopt Finnish as the command language. Since the officers and most of the crew spoke Swedish as their first language, this resulted in negative comments from the [[Swedish-speaking Finns|Swedish-speaking minority]], which considered Finnish to be \"the language of the peasants\", and even concerns about the safety of navigation. Captain [[Juho Lehtonen]], who had replaced Rosqvist in July 1926, even received [[hate mail]] from Swedish-speaking citizens, some of whom questioned his professional competence after a minor collision with a Swedish steamer [[SS Yrsa|''Yrsa'']] on 18 January 1927.<ref name=\"laurell163-167\">Laurell 1992, pp. 163\u2013167.</ref><ref>Kaukiainen 1992, p. 64.</ref>\n\n[[File:J\u00e4\u00e4karhu with other ships.jpg|thumb|right|''J\u00e4\u00e4karhu'' assisting icebound merchant ships in a Finnish port.]]\n\nWith the exception of the winter of 1929, the winters from 1927 until 1939 were relatively mild. Since ''J\u00e4\u00e4karhu'' was the most expensive to operate among the Finnish state-owned icebreakers, she saw little action during these years as she was always the last icebreaker to leave, beginning her season Helsinki and then moving to Hanko, and the first one to return.<ref name=\"kaukiainen114\">Kaukiainen 1992, p. 114.</ref> During very mild winters she was not put into service at all.<ref name=\"laurell140-151\" />\n\nHowever, the winter of 1929 was extremely difficult and by February the [[Baltic Sea]] was covered by ice all the way to the [[Danish straits]]. Finnish, Swedish and Soviet icebreakers were sent to escort merchant ships through the straits, and on 22 February 1929 ''J\u00e4\u00e4karhu'' was ordered to head south with a convoy of ships carrying export goods, assist and escort any icebound ship along the way and return with an inbound convoy to Turku and Hanko. She left on 24 February with a convoy of 12 ships and arrived at the edge of ice near [[Copenhagen]] on 4 March. After spending a few days assisting ships in the southern Baltic Sea, ''J\u00e4\u00e4karhu'' began her journey home on 8 March and arrived in Hanko on 12 March. During the past 15 days she had, in addition to the ships in her own convoys, released and assisted 24 other ships and sailed {{convert|2140|nmi}}.<ref name=\"laurell176-184\">Laurell 1992, pp. 176\u2013184.</ref>\n\n=== Second World War ===\n\nWhen relations with the Soviet Union deteriorated in late 1939 and the [[Winter War]] began on 30 November 1939, the Finnish state-owned icebreakers were armed and assigned to a wartime icebreaker flotilla. ''J\u00e4\u00e4karhu'' was sent to the [[Gulf of Bothnia]] to escort ships across the [[Sea of \u00c5land]]. Although she was often attacked by Soviet bombers, the enemy never scored a direct hit on the icebreaker, giving her a reputation of a lucky ship among the Finnish seafarers. After the Winter War ended with the 1940 [[Moscow Peace Treaty]], ''J\u00e4\u00e4karhu'' opened a channel to the icebound port of Hanko and helped to evacuate the city and the surrounding islands that had been leased to the Soviet Union as a naval base. During the period which later became known as the [[Interim Peace]], ''J\u00e4\u00e4karhu'' resumed her peacetime duties as an escort icebreaker in the Gulf of Finland.<ref name=\"laurell272-274\">Laurell 1992, pp. 272\u2013274.</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Continuation War]] started in June 1941, the state-owned icebreakers were again called to arms. On 13 September 1941, icebreakers ''Tarmo'' and ''J\u00e4\u00e4karhu'' participated in [[Operation Nordwind (1941)|Operation Nordwind]] together with Finnish and German naval ships.<ref name=\"laurell282-290\">Laurell 1992, pp. 282\u2013290</ref> The joint Finnish-German distraction manoeuvre was a complete failure. Not only did it fail to achieve its goal \u2013 it is uncertain if the Soviet forces even noticed the fleet \u2013 but when the ships turned back, [[Paravane (weapon)|paravanes]] dragged a Soviet naval mine against the hull of [[Finnish coastal defence ship Ilmarinen|Finnish coastal defence ship ''Ilmarinen'']], the flagship of the Finnish Navy, which sank in seven minutes following the explosion, claiming 271 lives.<ref>[http://koti.mbnet.fi/~karsikas/psl/ Panssarilaiva Ilmarisen tuho 13.9.1941]. {{retrieved |accessdate=24 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nDuring the extremely difficult winter of 1942, ''J\u00e4\u00e4karhu'' was paired up with the [[diesel-electric transmission|diesel-electric]] [[Sisu (1938 icebreaker)|''Sisu'']]. On 2 February 1942, she ran aground while assisting an icebound convoy of six cargo ships, damaging her bow propeller. After returning from a dry dock in [[Stockholm]], Sweden, ''J\u00e4\u00e4karhu'' resumed her duties in the Gulf of Finland, and together with ''Sisu'' she escorted almost 700 merchant ships through the ice-infested waters.<ref name=\"laurell282-290\" />\n\nThe winters of 1943 and 1944 were milder and ''J\u00e4\u00e4karhu'', being more expensive to operate than the smaller state-owned icebreakers, was not taken into service.<ref name=\"laurell282-290\" /> When the Continuation War ended with the signing of the [[Moscow Armistice]] on 19 September 1944, Finland was forced to hand over its best ice-strengthened tonnage to the Soviet Union as war reparations. This included the newest steam-powered icebreakers ''J\u00e4\u00e4karhu'' and ''Voima''.<ref name=\"laurell292-294\" />\n\n=== Later Soviet service ===\n\n''J\u00e4\u00e4karhu'' and ''Voima'' were officially handed over to the Soviet Union as war reparations on 24 February 1945 after having been stationed in [[Leningrad]] since December 1944. ''J\u00e4\u00e4karhu'' was renamed ''Sibiryakov'' after [[Alexander Mikhaylovich Sibiryakov]], a Russian explorer of the Arctic regions, and [[Sibiryakov (1909 icebreaker)|another Russian icebreaker]] that had been sunk by the [[German cruiser Admiral Scheer|German cruiser ''Admiral Scheer'']] in August 1942.<ref name=\"laurell292-294\">Laurell 1992, pp. 292\u2013294</ref>\n\nDuring her time under the Soviet flag, ''Sibiryakov'' was a common sight in the [[Gulf of Finland]] and her familiar profile was easily recognized by the Finnish seafarers despite her Soviet colors and insignia. In the mid-1950s, she was sent to Rotterdam for modernization, which included installing two radar antennas and adding a new superstructure between the smoke stacks.<ref name=\"laurell292-294\" />\n\nBeing one of the last large steam-powered icebreakers in active service, ''Sibiryakov'' was used in a 1960s Soviet documentary film to represent the steam-powered icebreaker, ''Yermak'', which had been broken up in 1964.<ref name=\"laurell292-294\" /> She was also used in the 1969 Soviet/Italian film [[The Red Tent (film)|''The Red Tent'']] to represent another Soviet icebreaker, [[Krasin (1917 icebreaker)|''Krasin'']], which had participated in the rescue mission of [[Umberto Nobile]] and other survivors of the crash of [[Airship Italia|airship ''Italia'']] in 1928. While the original 1917-built icebreaker was still in service at that time, her extensive rebuilding in 1953\u20131960 had changed the look of the vessel completely and thus a more traditional-looking icebreaker was needed for the role.\n\n''Sibiryakov'' was retired after the winter of 1972 and sold for scrap.

Built in 1926 by [[P. Smit Jr. Shipbuilding and Machine Factory]] in [[Rotterdam]], Netherlands, she was the last and largest steam-powered state-owned icebreaker of Finland. After two decades of successful service, ''J\u00e4\u00e4karhu'' was handed over to the Soviet Union as [[Finnish war reparations to the Soviet Union|war reparation]] in 1945 and renamed '''''Sibiryakov'''''. She remained in service until the 1970s and was broken up in 1972.\n\n== Background and construction ==\n\n[[File:J\u00e4\u00e4karhu trials.jpg|thumb|left|''J\u00e4\u00e4karhu'' leaving for sea trials in Rotterdam.]]\n\nWhen the [[Treaty of Tartu (Russian\u2013Finnish)|Treaty of Tartu]] was signed on 14 October 1920, Finland agreed to return the Russian icebreakers that the [[White Guard (Finland)|Finnish White Guard]] had seized during the [[Finnish Civil War|Civil War]] in 1918. As a result, the largest and most powerful state-owned icebreaker of Finland at that time, [[Suur T\u00f5ll (icebreaker)|''W\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen'']], was handed over to Estonia in 1922. Since both the size of the ships calling at the Finnish winter ports and the amount of exported goods, especially forest products, had increased considerably since the [[First World War]], there was a definite need for a large and powerful icebreaker. One of the key issues was the beam of the existing icebreakers, {{convert|14|m|ft}}, which was not enough for the new ships used to transport goods across the Atlantic Ocean.<ref name=\"laurell133-139\">Laurell 1992, pp. 133\u2013139.</ref>\n\nIn 1923, the state allocated FIM 10 million for the design and development of a new icebreaker based on the experiences gained during the four years that ''W\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen'' had spent under the Finnish flag. The basic design of the new vessel, which was to have a beam of at least {{convert|18|m|ft}}, was awarded to experienced Finnish naval architects [[K. Albin Johansson]] and [[Ossian Tybeck]].<ref name=\"laurell140-151\" />\n\nBy June 1923, bids ranging from [[Finnish markka|FIM]] 20.2 to 35.5 million had been received from 24 shipyards representing eight nationalities. The most expensive offer was received from the Finnish [[Sandvikens Skeppsdocka och Mekaniska Verkstad|Sandvikens Skeppsdocka och Mekaniska Verkstads Ab]] that was already building another new icebreaker, [[Voima (1924 icebreaker)|''Voima'']], in Helsinki. In the end, the contract was awarded to the Dutch shipbuilder P. Smit Jr. Shipbuilding and Machine Factory from Rotterdam. The shipyard had recently constructed four ice-strengthened ships for the [[Finland Steamship Company]] and the technical director of the company had personally spent several weeks on board the Finnish icebreaker [[Sampo (1898 icebreaker)|''Sampo'']] during the past winter.<ref name=\"laurell140-151\" />\n\nThe contract for the construction of a new icebreaker was signed on 17 April 1924 after the Dutch government and the town council of Rotterdam agreed to subsidize the construction costs by 175,000 [[Dutch guilder]]s, bringing the final cost to \u01921,563,000 (FIM 26,000,000). She was launched on 26 August 1925<ref name=\"dutch_magazines\">Nieuwe Rotterdamsche Courant (26 August 1925 and 17 January 1926) and Het Centrum (24 December 1925).

YLE, 19 March 2012. {{retrieved|accessdate=21 May 2012}}</ref> As the new icebreaker was being built, Captain [[Johan Rosqvist]], who has previously commanded ''Sampo'', was selected as the first captain of the new icebreaker, and in the summer of 1925 he travelled to Rotterdam together with a chief engineer and a second engineer to supervise the construction and outfitting of his new ship.<ref name=\"laurell140-151\" />\n\nOn 13 January 1926 ''J\u00e4\u00e4karhu'' was ready for first sea trials in the [[North Sea]]. Although there were still issues with the oil-fired boilers by late February, it was agreed to take the delivery of the new icebreaker on 2 March 1926 and solve the problems later as the winter of 1926 had turned out to be very severe. Despite the best efforts of existing Finnish state-owned icebreakers, the ice conditions in the Gulf of Finland and the Sea of \u00c5land were extremely difficult and vast pack ice fields closed off the shipping lanes outside the island of [[Ut\u00f6, Finland|Ut\u00f6]] at the edge of the [[Archipelago Sea]].<ref name=\"laurell140-151\" /><ref name=\"ramsay321-324\" />\n\nAlthough sometimes called the largest and most powerful icebreaker in the world by the press in the 1920s, ''J\u00e4\u00e4karhu'' was no match for the Soviet polar icebreakers [[Icebreaker Yermak|''Yermak'']] and [[Krasin (1916 icebreaker)|''Svyatogor'']] that had nearly twice the displacement and over twice the power of the Finnish icebreaker. However, as a Baltic escort icebreaker she was considered better than the giants and was often compared with the Soviet icebreaker [[Lenin (1916 icebreaker)|''Lenin'']], which was roughly of the same size and was considered a very successful design.<ref name=\"ramsay321-324\">Ramsay 1949, p. 320\u2013324.</ref>\n\n== Career ==\n\n=== Early career ===\n\n[[File:Jaakarhu 1920s.jpg|thumb|left|''J\u00e4\u00e4karhu'' in the port of [[Hanko]].]]\n\n''J\u00e4\u00e4karhu'' left Rotterdam on 3 March 1926. When the new icebreaker arrived in Finland on 7 March, she was welcomed by a number of icebound ships outside Ut\u00f6. After ''Sampo'' had arrived from [[Hanko]] with the Minister of Commerce and Industry, [[Tyko Reinikka]], other representatives of the state, and members of the press, the newest and largest state-owned icebreaker demonstrated her power by easily overcoming the notorious pack ice fields surrounding the island and escorting a convoy of three merchant ships to the open seas.<ref name=\"ramsay321-324\" /> After spending her first winter escorting ships in the Gulf of Finland, ''J\u00e4\u00e4karhu'' arrived in Helsinki on 27 April 1926. In July she was drydocked in [[Liep\u0101ja]], Latvia, where her bottom was repainted.<ref name=\"laurell140-151\" />\n\nIn 1926, ''J\u00e4\u00e4karhu'' became the first Finnish icebreaker to adopt Finnish as the command language. Since the officers and most of the crew spoke Swedish as their first language, this resulted in negative comments from the [[Swedish-speaking Finns|Swedish-speaking minority]], which considered Finnish to be \"the language of the peasants\", and even concerns about the safety of navigation. Captain [[Juho Lehtonen]], who had replaced Rosqvist in July 1926, even received [[hate mail]] from Swedish-speaking citizens, some of whom questioned his professional competence after a minor collision with a Swedish steamer [[SS Yrsa|''Yrsa'']] on 18 January 1927.<ref name=\"laurell163-167\">Laurell 1992, pp. 163\u2013167.</ref><ref>Kaukiainen 1992, p. 64.</ref>\n\n[[File:J\u00e4\u00e4karhu with other ships.jpg|thumb|right|''J\u00e4\u00e4karhu'' assisting icebound merchant ships in a Finnish port.]]\n\nWith the exception of the winter of 1929, the winters from 1927 until 1939 were relatively mild. Since ''J\u00e4\u00e4karhu'' was the most expensive to operate among the Finnish state-owned icebreakers, she saw little action during these years as she was always the last icebreaker to leave, beginning her season Helsinki and then moving to Hanko, and the first one to return.<ref name=\"kaukiainen114\">Kaukiainen 1992, p. 114.</ref> During very mild winters she was not put into service at all.<ref name=\"laurell140-151\" />\n\nHowever, the winter of 1929 was extremely difficult and by February the [[Baltic Sea]] was covered by ice all the way to the [[Danish straits]]. Finnish, Swedish and Soviet icebreakers were sent to escort merchant ships through the straits, and on 22 February 1929 ''J\u00e4\u00e4karhu'' was ordered to head south with a convoy of ships carrying export goods, assist and escort any icebound ship along the way and return with an inbound convoy to Turku and Hanko. She left on 24 February with a convoy of 12 ships and arrived at the edge of ice near [[Copenhagen]] on 4 March. After spending a few days assisting ships in the southern Baltic Sea, ''J\u00e4\u00e4karhu'' began her journey home on 8 March and arrived in Hanko on 12 March. During the past 15 days she had, in addition to the ships in her own convoys, released and assisted 24 other ships and sailed {{convert|2140|nmi}}.<ref name=\"laurell176-184\">Laurell 1992, pp. 176\u2013184.</ref>\n\n=== Second World War ===\n\nWhen relations with the Soviet Union deteriorated in late 1939 and the [[Winter War]] began on 30 November 1939, the Finnish state-owned icebreakers were armed and assigned to a wartime icebreaker flotilla. ''J\u00e4\u00e4karhu'' was sent to the [[Gulf of Bothnia]] to escort ships across the [[Sea of \u00c5land]]. Although she was often attacked by Soviet bombers, the enemy never scored a direct hit on the icebreaker, giving her a reputation of a lucky ship among the Finnish seafarers. After the Winter War ended with the 1940 [[Moscow Peace Treaty]], ''J\u00e4\u00e4karhu'' opened a channel to the icebound port of Hanko and helped to evacuate the city and the surrounding islands that had been leased to the Soviet Union as a naval base. During the period which later became known as the [[Interim Peace]], ''J\u00e4\u00e4karhu'' resumed her peacetime duties as an escort icebreaker in the Gulf of Finland.<ref name=\"laurell272-274\">Laurell 1992, pp. 272\u2013274.</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Continuation War]] started in June 1941, the state-owned icebreakers were again called to arms. On 13 September 1941, icebreakers ''Tarmo'' and ''J\u00e4\u00e4karhu'' participated in [[Operation Nordwind (1941)|Operation Nordwind]] together with Finnish and German naval ships.<ref name=\"laurell282-290\">Laurell 1992, pp. 282\u2013290</ref> The joint Finnish-German distraction manoeuvre was a complete failure. Not only did it fail to achieve its goal \u2013 it is uncertain if the Soviet forces even noticed the fleet \u2013 but when the ships turned back, [[Paravane (weapon)|paravanes]] dragged a Soviet naval mine against the hull of [[Finnish coastal defence ship Ilmarinen|Finnish coastal defence ship ''Ilmarinen'']], the flagship of the Finnish Navy, which sank in seven minutes following the explosion, claiming 271 lives.<ref>[http://koti.mbnet.fi/~karsikas/psl/ Panssarilaiva Ilmarisen tuho 13.9.1941]. {{retrieved |accessdate=24 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nDuring the extremely difficult winter of 1942, ''J\u00e4\u00e4karhu'' was paired up with the [[diesel-electric transmission|diesel-electric]] [[Sisu (1938 icebreaker)|''Sisu'']]. On 2 February 1942, she ran aground while assisting an icebound convoy of six cargo ships, damaging her bow propeller. After returning from a dry dock in [[Stockholm]], Sweden, ''J\u00e4\u00e4karhu'' resumed her duties in the Gulf of Finland, and together with ''Sisu'' she escorted almost 700 merchant ships through the ice-infested waters.<ref name=\"laurell282-290\" />\n\nThe winters of 1943 and 1944 were milder and ''J\u00e4\u00e4karhu'', being more expensive to operate than the smaller state-owned icebreakers, was not taken into service.<ref name=\"laurell282-290\" /> When the Continuation War ended with the signing of the [[Moscow Armistice]] on 19 September 1944, Finland was forced to hand over its best ice-strengthened tonnage to the Soviet Union as war reparations.

''J\u00e4\u00e4karhu'' was renamed ''Sibiryakov'' after [[Alexander Mikhaylovich Sibiryakov]], a Russian explorer of the Arctic regions, and [[Sibiryakov (1909 icebreaker)|another Russian icebreaker]] that had been sunk by the [[German cruiser Admiral Scheer|German cruiser ''Admiral Scheer'']] in August 1942.<ref name=\"laurell292-294\">Laurell 1992, pp. 292\u2013294</ref>\n\nDuring her time under the Soviet flag, ''Sibiryakov'' was a common sight in the [[Gulf of Finland]] and her familiar profile was easily recognized by the Finnish seafarers despite her Soviet colors and insignia. In the mid-1950s, she was sent to Rotterdam for modernization, which included installing two radar antennas and adding a new superstructure between the smoke stacks.<ref name=\"laurell292-294\" />\n\nBeing one of the last large steam-powered icebreakers in active service, ''Sibiryakov'' was used in a 1960s Soviet documentary film to represent the steam-powered icebreaker, ''Yermak'', which had been broken up in 1964.<ref name=\"laurell292-294\" /> She was also used in the 1969 Soviet/Italian film [[The Red Tent (film)|''The Red Tent'']] to represent another Soviet icebreaker, [[Krasin (1917 icebreaker)|''Krasin'']], which had participated in the rescue mission of [[Umberto Nobile]] and other survivors of the crash of [[Airship Italia|airship ''Italia'']] in 1928. While the original 1917-built icebreaker was still in service at that time, her extensive rebuilding in 1953\u20131960 had changed the look of the vessel completely and thus a more traditional-looking icebreaker was needed for the role.\n\n''Sibiryakov'' was retired after the winter of 1972 and sold for scrap.

He had no big contracts awaiting him and, while Michael appeared to experts to be the more promising of the two brothers, Leon was at that time the big shooting star, a television staple of [[ABC Sports]], on his way to a shot at heavyweight champion [[Muhammad Ali]]. Michael had their mother to care for, and he was intent on helping Leon prepare for Ali. All of this pushed Michael's career to the back burner. It was [[Butch Lewis]] in 1977 who convinced Michael to turn professional.<ref name=\"Spinks Jinx\"/><ref>Oates, Joyce Carol, & [[John Ranard]], ''On Boxing'' (HarperCollins Publishers, 1987, 1995, 2006), p. 34</ref><ref>Lotierzo, Frank J., \"Michael Spinks: A Real Champion\" ''Viewing Boxing From Ringside'', Tom Donelson, Editor (Writers Club Press, 2002), pgs. 111-12</ref>\n\n==Professional career==\n===Early years===\nSpinks then turned professional with a win over Eddie Benson, knocked out in one round on April 17, 1977 in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]. With that, Spinks began a 31 fight winning streak that would almost extend to the end of his career. After four more wins, Spinks finished '77 with the first fight that began a gradual ascent in opposition quality: an eight-round decision over Gary Summerhays, a popular young boxer of the time.\n\nIn 1978, Spinks won two fights, including an eight-round decision over former world Middleweight title challenger Tom Bethea, in the same undercard where his brother Leon dethroned Ali as world Heavyweight champion in Las Vegas.\n\n1979 saw Spinks get less than three minutes of boxing action inside a ring, with his only fight ending in a first round [[knockout]] of Marc Hans, but in 1980, Spinks took his ascent towards the top to another level, when he beat future IBF super-middleweight champion Murray Sutherland, David Conteh, and fringe contenders Ramon Ronquillo and Alvaro Yaqui Lopez (who challenged for a world title four times). Of his five wins that year, three came by knockout, Sutherland and Johnny Wilburn being the only ones who lasted the distance.\n\n===First world title===\nBy 1981, Spinks was already a top ranked contender, and after beating former and future world light-heavyweight champion [[Marvin Johnson (boxer)|Marvin Johnson]] by a knockout in four rounds, the [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] made Spinks their number one challenger, and so, on July 18 of that year, he met WBA light-heavyweight champion [[Eddie Mustafa Muhammad]], once again in Las Vegas. Spinks dropped Mustafa Muhammad in round 12 and went on to become the WBA light heavyweight champion with a 15-round decision win. He defended the title once in '81, beating Vonzell Johnson by a knockout in seven.\n\n1982 began with a knockout victory over Mustafa Wassaja. Spinks had become a superstar, at least in the boxing world. He began appearing on the covers of boxing magazines and boxing fans started clamoring for a unification fight with [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] champion [[Dwight Muhammad Qawi]]. Tragedy struck his life, however, when in January 1983, his 24-year-old wife, Sandy Massey, died in a car crash, leaving Spinks the single parent of his two-year-old daughter, Michelle.\n\n===Spinks vs Qawi===\n{{Main|Michael Spinks vs. Dwight Muhammad Qawi}}\nMeanwhile, the fight all the fans wanted was being asked for by boxing critics and magazine editors, too. On March 18, two months after his wife's death, Spinks and Qawi met in a boxing ring for the undisputed light heavyweight championship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/lheavy.htm|title=The Lineal Light Heavyweight Champions|publisher=The Cyber Boxing Zone Encyclopedia}}</ref> The fight was broadcast by [[HBO World Championship Boxing]], and, according to the book ''[[The Ring: Boxing the 20th Century]]'', Spinks had a very tough moment to overcome before it even started: His daughter asked him, while he was in his dressing room, if her mother would come to watch the fight. After breaking into tears he composed himself and dominated the fight with his jab and plenty of strategic hooks and crosses. He repeatedly stopped Qawi in his tracks over the first 11 rounds but cautiously waited for Qawi to come out of his crouched defense to resume his assault. Qawi scored a knockdown in round eight. The official scores were 144\u2013140, 144\u2013141, and 144\u2013141, all for Spinks, who was now the undisputed world Light Heavyweight champion. He defended the title one more time before the end of the year, against [[Oscar Rivadeneira]] in [[Alaska]], whom he beat by a ten-round knockout.\n\nSpinks fought only once in 1984, retaining his crown with a twelve-round majority decision over [[Eddie Davis (boxer)|Eddie Davis]]. He and Qawi were only a couple of weeks away from fighting a rematch in September of that year, but that fight got called off when Qawi was injured during training. Spinks also was recognized as IBF Light heavyweight champion in 1984.\n\n===Holmes vs Spinks===\nIn 1985, Spinks beat David Sears and Jim McDonald, both by knockout, in title defenses, before challenging [[Larry Holmes]] for the [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] and lineal heavyweight championship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/achamp.htm |title=The Lineal Heavyweight Champions |publisher=The Cyber Boxing Zone Encyclopedia |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090603092447/http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/achamp.htm |archivedate=2009-06-03 }}</ref> Holmes was trying to tie [[Rocky Marciano]]'s record of 49\u20130 as the heavyweight champion, but it was Spinks who made history that night, winning a controversial and narrow fifteen-round unanimous decision and becoming the first ever world light-heavyweight champion to win the world heavyweight title.  His controversial victory over Holmes was named [[Ring Magazine upsets of the year#1980s|''Ring Magazine'' Upset of the Year]]. With this, Michael and Leon had also become the first pair of brothers ever to be world heavyweight champions, followed two decades later by Wladimir and Vitali Klitschko.\n\nIn 1986, Spinks and Holmes fought a rematch as part of the [[heavyweight unification series]], and had nearly the same result, this time Spinks winning by a 15-round split decision. After that, he retained the world heavyweight championship once again, by a knockout in four against [[Steffen Tangstad]]. In 1987 he was stripped of the crown by the IBF for refusing to fight their [[mandatory challenger]], [[Tony Tucker]], and accepting a higher offer to fight [[Gerry Cooney]] instead. Spinks knocked out Cooney in five rounds, and after [[Mike Tyson]] had unified the heavyweight belts, fans started clamoring for a fight between them as many still recognized Spinks as the legitimate lineal champion.\n\n===Spinks vs Tyson===\n{{Main|Mike Tyson vs. Michael Spinks}}\nThe fight between Spinks and Mike Tyson took place in June 1988, with Tyson knocking Spinks down twice on his way to a first-round knockout. Tyson was the only fighter to floor Spinks. It would be Spinks's first defeat in the professional ring, as well as his last, as he retired following the fight.\n\nSpinks had a record of 31 wins and 1 loss, with 21 wins by knockout as a professional.\n\nIn addition to his success as a heavyweight, Spinks is generally considered one of the greatest light-heavyweight champions and fighters of all time. He was the only light-heavyweight champion to remain undefeated in the entire history of the division since its inception in 1903 (until [[Joe Calzaghe]]), as well as the only reigning light-heavyweight champion to win the heavyweight title.\n\n''[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]'' Magazine in 2002 ranked Spinks as the third greatest light-heavyweight of all time, behind [[Ezzard Charles]] and [[Archie Moore]], but ahead of [[Tommy Loughran]], [[Bob Foster (boxer)|Bob Foster]], [[Harold Johnson (boxer)|Harold Johnson]], [[Maxie Rosenbloom]] and [[Billy Conn]]. Furthermore, Spinks did what no other light-heavyweight champion was ever able to do: move up to win the world heavyweight championship, by decisioning IBF champion [[Larry Holmes]] in 1985.<ref>BoxRec, [http://boxrec.com/media/index.php/Division-By-Division_-_The_Greatest_Fighters_of_All-Time Division-By-Division - The Greatest Fighters of All-Time, As selected by The Ring magazine in various years, Lt Heavyweights], September 2002 Issue</ref>\n\nOn ''The Ring'' Magazine's list of 100 greatest punchers of all time, Spinks was ranked 42nd.<ref>{{cite journal |title=The 100 Greatest Punchers of All-Time! |journal=[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]] Yearbook: 2003 Edition |date=October 2003 |page=96 |url=http://boxrec.com/media/index.php/The_100_Greatest_Punchers_of_All-Time!}}</ref>\n\nOn ''The Ring'' Magazine's list of the 80 Best Fighters of the Last 80 Years, released in 2002, Spinks ranked 41st.<ref>[http://boxrec.com/media/index.php/The_80_Best_Fighters_of_the_Last_80_Years The 80 Best Fighters of the Last 80 Years, as selected by the ''Ring'' Magazine in the Annual 2002 Volume II Issue]</ref>\n\nEast Side Boxing said in its tribute to Spinks, \"Michael Spinks went undefeated fighting during the deepest era in Light Heavyweight history.

Aside from a rare event honoring him and occasionally attending fights, Spinks has largely remained off the boxing scene and out of the public eye.\nKen Hissner reported that, \"In October 2007 he was introduced into the ring at the Legendary Blue Horizon in Philadelphia. He seemed quite at home in the ring waving and talking to the fans.\"<ref>Hissner, Ken, [http://www.doghouseboxing.com/Ken/Hissner052710.htm \"Michael Spinks Interview - From Olympic Boxing Champ to Rocking the Pro Scene!\"], May 27, 2010 Doghouse Boxing.</ref>\n\nThe former champion lives privately in a seven-bedroom house, not including the guest house,  on a five-acre spread outside Wilmington, Delaware. However, he has been known for visiting schools\u2014carrying his gold medal and four title belts\u2014where he tells kids to pursue their dreams. \"Most of the kids don't have a clue who I am,\" he says, \"but they listen when they see all the gold.\"<ref>O'Keefe, John, [http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1016520/index.htm \"Michael Spinks, Champion Boxer\"] ''Sports Illustrated'' Magazine, Volume 91, No. 5, August 9, 1999, p. 20.</ref>\n\nFor years he remained close to his former promoter, [[Butch Lewis]], training fighters and making rare public appearances at events promoted by Lewis.<ref>Eisele, Andrew, [http://boxing.about.com/od/history/a/michaelspinks.htm \"Michael Spinks from 1976 Summer Olympics\"] ''About.com Boxing''</ref>\n\nIn 2011, however, after Lewis died from natural causes,<ref>Goldstein, Richard, [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/25/sports/butch-lewis-flashy-promoter-for-boxings-spinks-brothers-dies-at-65.html \"Butch Lewis, Flashy Promoter for Boxing's Spinks Brothers, Dies at 65\"] ''New York Times'', July 24, 2011</ref> it was reported that Spinks had sued Lewis's estate in a Delaware Chancery Court, alleging that the promoter had failed to properly manage more than $24 million Spinks had earned in the ring and had violated their agreements that Lewis would continue to manage Spinks's money and pay his living expenses for the rest of the boxer's life.  The lawsuit alleged that he commingled his personal funds with Spinks's and used Spinks's money to pay his and his children's own personal and business expenses.  Also named as a defendant was Robert L. Johnson, founder of Black Entertainment Television, head of the real estate firm of RLJ Development LLC, in Bethesda, Maryland, and one of the executors of Lewis's $8.5 million estate.\n\nAccording to Spinks's lawyers, following Lewis's death Johnson and attorney Leonard Williams stopped the payments without telling him, which in turn caused Spinks' health insurance to lapse and bills totaling up to $50,000 a month to go unpaid. \"Spinks had to invade his pension and retirement funds and incur significant taxes and penalties in order to meet these obligations,\" the boxer's lawyers added in the filings.\n\nSpinks asked that the court bar Johnson and Williams from transferring any further assets from Lewis's estate until there can be a full accounting and payments to Spinks are resumed.<ref>Feeley, Jef, & and Phil Milford, [http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-10-14/boxing-champion-michael-spinks-sues-former-promoter-s-estate.html \"Boxing Champion Michael Spinks Sues

After 10 successful title defenses, Spinks moved up to heavyweight, and as an underdog defeated long-reigning [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] heavyweight champion [[Larry Holmes]]; in doing so, Spinks became the first reigning light heavyweight world champion to win the heavyweight title. In his final fight, Spinks was [[Mike Tyson vs. Michael Spinks|knocked out]] by [[Mike Tyson]] in 91 seconds, the only defeat of his professional career.\n\nSpinks has been inducted into the [[International Boxing Hall of Fame]] and the World Boxing Hall of Fame.

He had no big contracts awaiting him and, while Michael appeared to experts to be the more promising of the two brothers, Leon was at that time the big shooting star, a television staple of [[ABC Sports]], on his way to a shot at heavyweight champion [[Muhammad Ali]]. Michael had their mother to care for, and he was intent on helping Leon prepare for Ali. All of this pushed Michael's career to the back burner. It was [[Butch Lewis]] in 1977 who convinced Michael to turn professional.<ref name=\"Spinks Jinx\"/><ref>Oates, Joyce Carol, & [[John Ranard]], ''On Boxing'' (HarperCollins Publishers, 1987, 1995, 2006), p. 34</ref><ref>Lotierzo, Frank J., \"Michael Spinks: A Real Champion\" ''Viewing Boxing From Ringside'', Tom Donelson, Editor (Writers Club Press, 2002), pgs. 111-12</ref>\n\n==Professional career==\n===Early years===\nSpinks then turned professional with a win over Eddie Benson, knocked out in one round on April 17, 1977 in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]. With that, Spinks began a 31 fight winning streak that would almost extend to the end of his career. After four more wins, Spinks finished '77 with the first fight that began a gradual ascent in opposition quality: an eight-round decision over Gary Summerhays, a popular young boxer of the time.\n\nIn 1978, Spinks won two fights, including an eight-round decision over former world Middleweight title challenger Tom Bethea, in the same undercard where his brother Leon dethroned Ali as world Heavyweight champion in Las Vegas.\n\n1979 saw Spinks get less than three minutes of boxing action inside a ring, with his only fight ending in a first round [[knockout]] of Marc Hans, but in 1980, Spinks took his ascent towards the top to another level, when he beat future IBF super-middleweight champion Murray Sutherland, David Conteh, and fringe contenders Ramon Ronquillo and Alvaro Yaqui Lopez (who challenged for a world title four times). Of his five wins that year, three came by knockout, Sutherland and Johnny Wilburn being the only ones who lasted the distance.\n\n===First world title===\nBy 1981, Spinks was already a top ranked contender, and after beating former and future world light-heavyweight champion [[Marvin Johnson (boxer)|Marvin Johnson]] by a knockout in four rounds, the [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] made Spinks their number one challenger, and so, on July 18 of that year, he met WBA light-heavyweight champion [[Eddie Mustafa Muhammad]], once again in Las Vegas. Spinks dropped Mustafa Muhammad in round 12 and went on to become the WBA light heavyweight champion with a 15-round decision win. He defended the title once in '81, beating Vonzell Johnson by a knockout in seven.\n\n1982 began with a knockout victory over Mustafa Wassaja. Spinks had become a superstar, at least in the boxing world. He began appearing on the covers of boxing magazines and boxing fans started clamoring for a unification fight with [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] champion [[Dwight Muhammad Qawi]]. Tragedy struck his life, however, when in January 1983, his 24-year-old wife, Sandy Massey, died in a car crash, leaving Spinks the single parent of his two-year-old daughter, Michelle.\n\n===Spinks vs Qawi===\n{{Main|Michael Spinks vs. Dwight Muhammad Qawi}}\nMeanwhile, the fight all the fans wanted was being asked for by boxing critics and magazine editors, too. On March 18, two months after his wife's death, Spinks and Qawi met in a boxing ring for the undisputed light heavyweight championship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/lheavy.htm|title=The Lineal Light Heavyweight Champions|publisher=The Cyber Boxing Zone Encyclopedia}}</ref> The fight was broadcast by [[HBO World Championship Boxing]], and, according to the book ''[[The Ring: Boxing the 20th Century]]'', Spinks had a very tough moment to overcome before it even started: His daughter asked him, while he was in his dressing room, if her mother would come to watch the fight. After breaking into tears he composed himself and dominated the fight with his jab and plenty of strategic hooks and crosses. He repeatedly stopped Qawi in his tracks over the first 11 rounds but cautiously waited for Qawi to come out of his crouched defense to resume his assault. Qawi scored a knockdown in round eight. The official scores were 144\u2013140, 144\u2013141, and 144\u2013141, all for Spinks, who was now the undisputed world Light Heavyweight champion. He defended the title one more time before the end of the year, against [[Oscar Rivadeneira]] in [[Alaska]], whom he beat by a ten-round knockout.\n\nSpinks fought only once in 1984, retaining his crown with a twelve-round majority decision over [[Eddie Davis (boxer)|Eddie Davis]]. He and Qawi were only a couple of weeks away from fighting a rematch in September of that year, but that fight got called off when Qawi was injured during training. Spinks also was recognized as IBF Light heavyweight champion in 1984.\n\n===Holmes vs Spinks===\nIn 1985, Spinks beat David Sears and Jim McDonald, both by knockout, in title defenses, before challenging [[Larry Holmes]] for the [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] and lineal heavyweight championship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/achamp.htm |title=The Lineal Heavyweight Champions |publisher=The Cyber Boxing Zone Encyclopedia |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090603092447/http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/achamp.htm |archivedate=2009-06-03 }}</ref> Holmes was trying to tie [[Rocky Marciano]]'s record of 49\u20130 as the heavyweight champion, but it was Spinks who made history that night, winning a controversial and narrow fifteen-round unanimous decision and becoming the first ever world light-heavyweight champion to win the world heavyweight title.  His controversial victory over Holmes was named [[Ring Magazine upsets of the year#1980s|''Ring Magazine'' Upset of the Year]]. With this, Michael and Leon had also become the first pair of brothers ever to be world heavyweight champions, followed two decades later by Wladimir and Vitali Klitschko.\n\nIn 1986, Spinks and Holmes fought a rematch as part of the [[heavyweight unification series]], and had nearly the same result, this time Spinks winning by a 15-round split decision. After that, he retained the world heavyweight championship once again, by a knockout in four against [[Steffen Tangstad]]. In 1987 he was stripped of the crown by the IBF for refusing to fight their [[mandatory challenger]], [[Tony Tucker]], and accepting a higher offer to fight [[Gerry Cooney]] instead. Spinks knocked out Cooney in five rounds, and after [[Mike Tyson]] had unified the heavyweight belts, fans started clamoring for a fight between them as many still recognized Spinks as the legitimate lineal champion.\n\n===Spinks vs Tyson===\n{{Main|Mike Tyson vs. Michael Spinks}}\nThe fight between Spinks and Mike Tyson took place in June 1988, with Tyson knocking Spinks down twice on his way to a first-round knockout. Tyson was the only fighter to floor Spinks. It would be Spinks's first defeat in the professional ring, as well as his last, as he retired following the fight.\n\nSpinks had a record of 31 wins and 1 loss, with 21 wins by knockout as a professional.\n\nIn addition to his success as a heavyweight, Spinks is generally considered one of the greatest light-heavyweight champions and fighters of all time. He was the only light-heavyweight champion to remain undefeated in the entire history of the division since its inception in 1903 (until [[Joe Calzaghe]]), as well as the only reigning light-heavyweight champion to win the heavyweight title.\n\n''[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]'' Magazine in 2002 ranked Spinks as the third greatest light-heavyweight of all time, behind [[Ezzard Charles]] and [[Archie Moore]], but ahead of [[Tommy Loughran]], [[Bob Foster (boxer)|Bob Foster]], [[Harold Johnson (boxer)|Harold Johnson]], [[Maxie Rosenbloom]] and [[Billy Conn]]. Furthermore, Spinks did what no other light-heavyweight champion was ever able to do: move up to win the world heavyweight championship, by decisioning IBF champion [[Larry Holmes]] in 1985.<ref>BoxRec, [http://boxrec.com/media/index.php/Division-By-Division_-_The_Greatest_Fighters_of_All-Time Division-By-Division - The Greatest Fighters of All-Time, As selected by The Ring magazine in various years, Lt Heavyweights], September 2002 Issue</ref>\n\nOn ''The Ring'' Magazine's list of 100 greatest punchers of all time, Spinks was ranked 42nd.<ref>{{cite journal |title=The 100 Greatest Punchers of All-Time! |journal=[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]] Yearbook: 2003 Edition |date=October 2003 |page=96 |url=http://boxrec.com/media/index.php/The_100_Greatest_Punchers_of_All-Time!}}</ref>\n\nOn ''The Ring'' Magazine's list of the 80 Best Fighters of the Last 80 Years, released in 2002, Spinks ranked 41st.<ref>[http://boxrec.com/media/index.php/The_80_Best_Fighters_of_the_Last_80_Years The 80 Best Fighters of the Last 80 Years, as selected by the ''Ring'' Magazine in the Annual 2002 Volume II Issue]</ref>\n\nEast Side Boxing said in its tribute to Spinks, \"Michael Spinks went undefeated fighting during the deepest era in Light Heavyweight history.

The lawsuit alleged that he commingled his personal funds with Spinks's and used Spinks's money to pay his and his children's own personal and business expenses.  Also named as a defendant was Robert L. Johnson, founder of Black Entertainment Television, head of the real estate firm of RLJ Development LLC, in Bethesda, Maryland, and one of the executors of Lewis's $8.5 million estate.\n\nAccording to Spinks's lawyers, following Lewis's death Johnson and attorney Leonard Williams stopped the payments without telling him, which in turn caused Spinks' health insurance to lapse and bills totaling up to $50,000 a month to go unpaid. \"Spinks had to invade his pension and retirement funds and incur significant taxes and penalties in order to meet these obligations,\" the boxer's lawyers added in the filings.\n\nSpinks asked that the court bar Johnson and Williams from transferring any further assets from Lewis's estate until there can be a full accounting and payments to Spinks are resumed.<ref>Feeley, Jef, & and Phil Milford, [http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-10-14/boxing-champion-michael-spinks-sues-former-promoter-s-estate.html \"Boxing Champion Michael Spinks Sues
