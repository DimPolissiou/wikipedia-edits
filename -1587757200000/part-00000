Northern Sea Route is also a potentially important link between Europe and Asia as it significantly reduces the transit time in comparison to the route through the [[Suez Canal]].<ref name=\"themotorship\" /><ref name=\"kitagawa\" /> While the Soviet Union had constructed a large fleet of ice-strengthened cargo ships, they could not keep up with the large [[nuclear-powered icebreaker]]s and were often damaged by ice during towing operations.

Not only was running two parallel development projects wasting effort and resources for the shipyards, but constructing a single type of ships instead of two would bring savings to the customer in form of reduced maintenance and spare part costs.

They were used to unload cargo from icebound ships and deliver the much-needed supplies to isolated communities along the coast. The ships also acted as escort icebreakers, using their stern notches to tow smaller ships through the ice fields even though it was not their original purpose.<ref name=\"navigator584\" /> Among the ships that received assistance from the new SA-15 class ships was the nuclear icebreaker [[Sibir (1977 nuclear icebreaker)|''Sibir'']] which had to be helped on several occasions by ''[[MV Okha|Okha]]''. Unlike the freighters, the icebreaker had no abrasion-resistant coating and suffered from severe hull corrosion that considerably increased the ice resistance of the vessel.<ref name=\"marchenko\" />\n\n==== Initial Soviet and Russian owners ====\n\nThe largest initial operator was [[Murmansk Shipping Company]] (MSCO) which owned and operated a fleet of ten SA-15 class cargo ships in the western part of the Soviet arctic. It was followed by two companies operating in the eastern regions, [[Far East Shipping Company]] (FESCO) with seven and [[Sakhalin Shipping Company]] with two vessels.<ref name=\"aarc_ref\">[http://www.akerarctic.fi/referencelist.htm References] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718163108/http://www.akerarctic.fi/referencelist.htm |date=18 July 2011 }}.

In winter the SA-15 class freighters mainly supported the Norilsk-Dudinka operation, providing a continuous flow of non-ferrous metal concentrates to the smelters of the [[Kola Peninsula]] and other industries within the Soviet Union,<ref name=\"mmcnorilsknickel\" /> but also carried other cargo especially when the ice conditions became too difficult for other vessels.<ref name=\"thesovietarctic\" /> In 1990, ''Norilsk'' became the first ship to transport cargo from Japan to Europe via the Northern Sea Route.<ref name=\"norilsk_snt\">[http://www.seanews.com.tr/article/HOTN/42174/First-of-the-SA15-freighters-sold-for-scrap/ First of the SA15 freighters sold for scrap].

The bow design puts equal emphasis on both icebreaking and [[seakeeping]] characteristics, meaning that in addition to good icebreaking and manoeuvring capabilities in various ice conditions the vessel must be able to operate in open water without [[slamming|bottom slamming]] or shipping of green water occurring in rough seas. The sides are flared to prevent the ship from stopping or being damaged when operating in compressive ice fields. The aft part of the hull, while a compromise between good reversing qualities in the ice and low level of propeller-induced vibrations in the stern, is also designed to prevent pieces of ice from coming in contact with the propeller.<ref name=\"themotorship2\" /> The ships are also equipped with stern notches similar to those found in icebreakers, but instead of towing other ships they are meant to be used to allow safe assistance from icebreakers in particularly difficult ice conditions.<ref name=\"themotorship\" />\n\nThe material used in the hull is largely grade E shipbuilding steel which is suitable for cold temperatures down to {{convert|-50|C|F|0}}. A special high-strength steel, [[Rautaruukki]] Raex E32 Polar, is used in the main components of the ice zone where it was protected by abrasion-resistant low-friction paint, [[Inerta 160]].

Pressurized air released from nozzles located below the waterline lubricates the hull and, by reducing friction between steel and ice, improves the ship's ability to operate in difficult ice conditions such as pressure ridges and reduces the risk of becoming stuck in ice. The system can also be used to steer the ship at low speeds.<ref name=\"themotorship\" />\n\nFor electricity production the ships have four auxiliary generating sets, W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4-Vasa 624TS 4-stroke medium-speed diesel engines driving 1,000 kVa [[Str\u00f6mberg (company)|Str\u00f6mberg]] alternators.

Heavy cargo up to 80 tonnes and long goods up to {{convert|25|m|ft|1|abbr=out}} can also be carried. The ships, designed to serve the remote arctic regions, are also equipped with flexible cargo handling equipment for loading and unloading in undeveloped ports. The cargo gear is designed to operate normally at an ambient temperature of {{convert|-40|C|F|0}} and maintain operational condition at temperatures as low as {{convert|-50|C|F|0}}. It is also extensively [[winterization|winterized]] by arranging most of the operating equipment inside the cargo access units.<ref name=\"themotorship\" />\n\nThe ships have five holds fitted with [[tweendecker|tweendecks]], four forwards and one abaft of the superstructure, with a total grain capacity of 31,181 cubic metres. The foremost hold, No. 1, is specially designed for the carriage of explosives for the mining industry, inflammable liquids and chemicals in packages, and for this reason has a separate seawater fire extinguishing system that can also be used to cool the bulkhead between the foremost holds. Lower holds No. 2, 3 and 4 are designed for bulk cargoes such as coal, ore and grain. Containers can be carried in all holds and on the hatch covers, and the total container capacity of the SA-15 class ships is 576 [[twenty-foot equivalent unit]]s, forty of which can be refrigerated, or 236 [[forty-foot equivalent unit]]s. In addition the ships can carry special ten-foot ore concentrate containers in holds No. 2, 3 and 4, with two layers on tank top and one on tweendeck.<ref name=\"themotorship\" />\n\nFor loading and unloading of general cargo, containers and bulk cargo the ships are geared with four deck cranes located on the centerline, one on the aft deck and three forwards of the superstructure. The No. 2 crane on the foredeck is a twin type crane with a lifting capacity of 2 \u00d7 40 tonnes at {{convert|20|m|ft|1|abbr=out}} while the others are single hydraulic cranes, capable of lifting 20 tonnes, with a maximum outreach of {{convert|22|m|ft|1|abbr=out}}.<ref name=\"themotorship\" />\n\nThe ships can carry [[Ro-ro|roll-on/roll-off cargo]] on the continuous tweendeck between holds No. 2 and No. 5. The cargo space, which has a capacity of 570 [[lane metres]] with a width of 3.0 metres and free height of 4.3 metres, is divided into five watertight compartments with sliding bulkhead doors located between the holds to meet the subdivision requirements. Wheeled cargo can be loaded and unloaded via a 41-tonne stern quarter ramp angled at 65 degrees to the centerline. The 18-metre ({{convert|18|m|ft|1|abbr=out|disp=output only}}) ramp has a free driving width of {{convert|5|m|ft|1|abbr=out}} and can handle cargo weighing up to 56 tonnes. It can also be lowered directly on ice if the thickness exceeds one metre although the resulting slope angle of 17 degrees would be too much for normal vehicles.<ref name=\"themotorship\" />\n\nWhile not designed to carry liquid cargo, the ships have a provision to transfer fuel from either side of the ship to another vessel moored alongside.<ref name=\"themotorship\" />\n\nA novel cargo handling feature of the SA-15 class freighters was an air cushion platform which could be carried on the weather deck and used to transport cargo ashore or directly to a warehouse in locations having little or no cargo handling facilities. These [[hovercraft]]s, manufactured by W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4, were powered by a 625&nbsp;kW stern-mounted diesel engine driving two fans giving the platform a hovering height of {{convert|0.6|-|0.7|m|ft|abbr=on}}. They were capable of carrying a payload of 38 tonnes over ice, water, land and marshy terrain when towed by a tractor or a tug or, if necessary, by using an auxiliary propulsion unit that gave the platform a speed of at least two knots.<ref name=\"themotorship\" /><ref name=\"navigator5_81\">Ilmatyynyaluksia. Navigator 5/1981.</ref> However, the air cushion platforms were rarely used and have not been seen on board the SA-15 class freighters since the 1980s.<ref name=\"thesovietarctic\" />\n\n=== SA-15 Super ===\n\n[[File:Anatoliy Kolesnichenko 20090809.jpg|thumb|[[MV Anatoliy Kolesnichenko|''Anatoliy Kolesnichenko'']] and the other SA-15 Super class ships have a folding stern quarter ramp and several other modifications to the original design.]]\n\nWhen Valmet Oy received a follow-up order for five SA-15 class cargo ships in 1984, some modifications to the ship were made based on the owner's experiences during the past winter that had been exceptionally hard.<ref name=\"themotorship1984\" /> While the basic design followed that of the other vessels and the general characteristics remained largely the same, due to the changes the last five ships are sometimes referred to as a separate subclass, SA-15 Super.<ref name=\"navigator9_84\" /><ref name=\"sa15super\" />\n\nThe majority of the changes were internal. While the module-based design of the engine room, pioneered by the SA-15 class ships, reduced the amount of working hours while building the ship, the piping was completely redesigned to reduce its overall length and make basic maintenance easier. The fifth auxiliary engine was also left out as it was rarely used in actual operation. Winterization was improved by installing heating elements in the double bottom tanks, improving the heating in other ballast water tanks and increasing ice strengthening in some parts of the hull.<ref name=\"navigator9_84\" />\n\nSome modifications were made to cargo spaces and cargo handling equipment. The aftmost lower hold was turned into a refrigerated cargo space and a dividing bulkhead was removed from the foremost hold. The tweendeck hatch covers were changed from wire-operated to hydraulic and, due to the rearranging of the aft deck winches and to ease the handling of mooring lines, the aft hatch was made slightly smaller than in the original ships. The capacity of the deck crane in front of the superstructure was increased to 40 tons to allow better handling of ore containers. The stern quarter ramp was also changed to a folding type that would maintain constant pressure on the quay. There were also some changes to the general arrangements of the lowest accommodation deck.<ref name=\"navigator9_84\" />\n\nExternally one of the most noticeable changes in addition to the stern ramp was lowering the lookout post in the bow to improve visibility from the bridge.<ref name=\"navigator9_84\" />\n\n=== Bank Line conversion ===\n\n[[File:Boularibank 20090616.jpg|thumb|left|''Boularibank'' (ex-[[MV Nikel|''Nikel'']]) had a [[bulbous bow]] retrofitted to its icebreaker bow to reduce fuel consumption.]]\n\nThe SA-15 class ships purchased by Andrew Weir Shipping were converted at [[Cammell Laird]] and [[Tyne Tees Dockyard]] for South Pacific service in 1995 by increasing their cargo-carrying capacity and removing specialized icebreaking features in favor of reduced operating costs.\n\nThe conversion consisted of retrofitting a [[bulbous bow]], faired to the existing icebreaker bow, to reduce the wave resistance and replacing the ice-strengthened propeller blades with more efficient highly skewed blades, designed by [[KaMeWa]], to improve speed and fuel consumption. Six double-bottom tanks were converted from bunker to ballast water tanks while nine wing tanks were converted from ballast to heavy fuel oil and two to dedicated heeling tanks. The cargo-carrying capacity of the ships was increased by converting deep tanks between the cargo holds and below the lower deck in the bow for the carriage of vegetable oils. Their maximum allowable draught was increased to {{convert|11.3|m|ft|2|abbr=out}}, which substantially increased the ships' deadweight tonnage. Other changes included upgrading the cargo handling and lifesaving equipment, converting ten cabins for passengers and installing a new [[incinerator]] to deal with the shipboard waste. The stern notch was also no longer needed and thus removed, but the W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 Air Bubbling system was retained for maneuvering.<ref name=\"shiprepair_196\">Innovative Bank Line conversion of former Russian Arctic cargo ships. Shiprepair and Conversion Technology, International Journal of the Royal Institution of Naval Arctitects. 1st Quarter 1996. Pages 3-4.</ref>\n\nWhen China Navigation Co Ltd bought the South Pacific service from Andrew Weir Shipping in 2006, the four SA-15 class freighters were time chartered by the new owner and further modified during drydocking in Singapore. During the refit an additional W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 Auxpac 6L20 generating set, capable of operating on the same grade of heavy fuel oil as the main engines, was installed alongside the existing smaller 624TS diesel generators and some ballast tanks were converted to heavy fuel oil to increase the bunker capacity. Fuel efficiency was further improved by grit blasting the underwater parts to minimize hull roughness and installing [[wake-equalising duct]]s and a [[rudder bulb]].<ref name=\"shiprepair_106\">Upgrade for Bank Line quartet.

Northern Sea Route is also an important link between Europe and Asia as it significantly reduces the transit time in comparison to the route through the [[Suez Canal]].<ref name=\"themotorship\" /><ref name=\"kitagawa\" /> While the Soviet Union had constructed a large fleet of ice-strengthened cargo ships, they could not keep up with the large [[nuclear-powered icebreaker]]s and were often damaged by ice during towing operations.

Not only was running two parallel development projects wasting effort and resources for the shipyards, but constructing a single type of ships instead of two would bring savings to the customer in form of reduced maintenance and spare part costs.

They were used to unload cargo from icebound ships and deliver the much-needed supplies to isolated communities along the coast. The ships also acted as escort icebreakers, using their stern notches to tow smaller ships through the ice fields even though it was not their original purpose.<ref name=\"navigator584\" /> Among the ships that received assistance from the new SA-15 class ships was the nuclear icebreaker [[Sibir (1977 nuclear icebreaker)|''Sibir'']] which had to be helped on several occasions by ''[[MV Okha|Okha]]''. Unlike the freighters, the icebreaker had no abrasion-resistant coating and suffered from severe hull corrosion that considerably increased the ice resistance of the vessel.<ref name=\"marchenko\" />\n\n==== Initial Soviet and Russian owners ====\n\nThe largest initial operator was [[Murmansk Shipping Company]] (MSCO) which owned and operated a fleet of ten SA-15 class cargo ships in the western part of the Soviet arctic. It was followed by two companies operating in the eastern regions, [[Far East Shipping Company]] (FESCO) with seven and [[Sakhalin Shipping Company]] with two vessels.<ref name=\"aarc_ref\">[http://www.akerarctic.fi/referencelist.htm References] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718163108/http://www.akerarctic.fi/referencelist.htm |date=18 July 2011 }}.

In winter the SA-15 class freighters mainly supported the Norilsk-Dudinka operation, providing a continuous flow of non-ferrous metal concentrates to the smelters of the [[Kola Peninsula]] and other industries within the Soviet Union,<ref name=\"mmcnorilsknickel\" /> but also carried other cargo especially when the ice conditions became too difficult for other vessels.<ref name=\"thesovietarctic\" /> In 1990, ''Norilsk'' became the first ship to transport cargo from Japan to Europe via the Northern Sea Route.<ref name=\"norilsk_snt\">[http://www.seanews.com.tr/article/HOTN/42174/First-of-the-SA15-freighters-sold-for-scrap/ First of the SA15 freighters sold for scrap].

The bow design puts equal emphasis on both icebreaking and [[seakeeping]] characteristics, meaning that in addition to good icebreaking and manoeuvring capabilities in various ice conditions the vessel must be able to operate in open water without [[slamming|bottom slamming]] or shipping of green water occurring in rough seas. The sides are flared to prevent the ship from stopping or being damaged when operating in compressive ice fields. The aft part of the hull, while a compromise between good reversing qualities in the ice and low level of propeller-induced vibrations in the stern, is also designed to prevent pieces of ice from coming in contact with the propeller.<ref name=\"themotorship2\" /> The ships are also equipped with stern notches similar to those found in icebreakers, but instead of towing other ships they are meant to be used to allow safe assistance from icebreakers in particularly difficult ice conditions.<ref name=\"themotorship\" />\n\nThe material used in the hull is largely grade E shipbuilding steel which is suitable for cold temperatures down to {{convert|-50|C|F|0}}. A special high-strength steel, [[Rautaruukki]] Raex E32 Polar, is used in the main components of the ice zone where it was protected by abrasion-resistant low-friction paint, [[Inerta 160]].

Pressurized air released from nozzles located below the waterline lubricates the hull and, by reducing friction between steel and ice, improves the ship's ability to operate in difficult ice conditions such as pressure ridges and reduces the risk of becoming stuck in ice. The system can also be used to steer the ship at low speeds.<ref name=\"themotorship\" />\n\nFor electricity production the ships have four auxiliary generating sets, W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4-Vasa 624TS 4-stroke medium-speed diesel engines driving 1,000 kVa [[Str\u00f6mberg (company)|Str\u00f6mberg]] alternators.

Heavy cargo up to 80 tonnes and long goods up to {{convert|25|m|ft|1|abbr=out}} can also be carried. The ships, designed to serve the remote arctic regions, are also equipped with flexible cargo handling equipment for loading and unloading in undeveloped ports. The cargo gear is designed to operate normally at an ambient temperature of {{convert|-40|C|F|0}} and maintain operational condition at temperatures as low as {{convert|-50|C|F|0}}. It is also extensively [[winterization|winterized]] by arranging most of the operating equipment inside the cargo access units.<ref name=\"themotorship\" />\n\nThe ships have five holds fitted with [[tweendecker|tweendecks]], four forwards and one abaft of the superstructure, with a total grain capacity of 31,181 cubic metres. The foremost hold, No. 1, is specially designed for the carriage of explosives for the mining industry, inflammable liquids and chemicals in packages, and for this reason has a separate seawater fire extinguishing system that can also be used to cool the bulkhead between the foremost holds. Lower holds No. 2, 3 and 4 are designed for bulk cargoes such as coal, ore and grain. Containers can be carried in all holds and on the hatch covers, and the total container capacity of the SA-15 class ships is 576 [[twenty-foot equivalent unit]]s, forty of which can be refrigerated, or 236 [[forty-foot equivalent unit]]s. In addition the ships can carry special ten-foot ore concentrate containers in holds No. 2, 3 and 4, with two layers on tank top and one on tweendeck.<ref name=\"themotorship\" />\n\nFor loading and unloading of general cargo, containers and bulk cargo the ships are geared with four deck cranes located on the centerline, one on the aft deck and three forwards of the superstructure. The No. 2 crane on the foredeck is a twin type crane with a lifting capacity of 2 \u00d7 40 tonnes at {{convert|20|m|ft|1|abbr=out}} while the others are single hydraulic cranes, capable of lifting 20 tonnes, with a maximum outreach of {{convert|22|m|ft|1|abbr=out}}.<ref name=\"themotorship\" />\n\nThe ships can carry [[Ro-ro|roll-on/roll-off cargo]] on the continuous tweendeck between holds No. 2 and No. 5. The cargo space, which has a capacity of 570 [[lane metres]] with a width of 3.0 metres and free height of 4.3 metres, is divided into five watertight compartments with sliding bulkhead doors located between the holds to meet the subdivision requirements. Wheeled cargo can be loaded and unloaded via a 41-tonne stern quarter ramp angled at 65 degrees to the centerline. The 18-metre ({{convert|18|m|ft|1|abbr=out|disp=output only}}) ramp has a free driving width of {{convert|5|m|ft|1|abbr=out}} and can handle cargo weighing up to 56 tonnes. It can also be lowered directly on ice if the thickness exceeds one metre although the resulting slope angle of 17 degrees would be too much for normal vehicles.<ref name=\"themotorship\" />\n\nWhile not designed to carry liquid cargo, the ships have a provision to transfer fuel from either side of the ship to another vessel moored alongside.<ref name=\"themotorship\" />\n\nA novel cargo handling feature of the SA-15 class freighters was an air cushion platform which could be carried on the weather deck and used to transport cargo ashore or directly to a warehouse in locations having little or no cargo handling facilities. These [[hovercraft]]s, manufactured by W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4, were powered by a 625&nbsp;kW stern-mounted diesel engine driving two fans giving the platform a hovering height of {{convert|0.6|-|0.7|m|ft|abbr=on}}. They were capable of carrying a payload of 38 tonnes over ice, water, land and marshy terrain when towed by a tractor or a tug or, if necessary, by using an auxiliary propulsion unit that gave the platform a speed of at least two knots.<ref name=\"themotorship\" /><ref name=\"navigator5_81\">Ilmatyynyaluksia.

While the module-based design of the engine room, pioneered by the SA-15 class ships, reduced the amount of working hours while building the ship, the piping was completely redesigned to reduce its overall length and make basic maintenance easier. The fifth auxiliary engine was also left out as it was rarely used in actual operation. Winterization was improved by installing heating elements in the double bottom tanks, improving the heating in other ballast water tanks and increasing ice strengthening in some parts of the hull.<ref name=\"navigator9_84\" />\n\nSome modifications were made to cargo spaces and cargo handling equipment. The aftmost lower hold was turned into a refrigerated cargo space and a dividing bulkhead was removed from the foremost hold. The tweendeck hatch covers were changed from wire-operated to hydraulic and, due to the rearranging of the aft deck winches and to ease the handling of mooring lines, the aft hatch was made slightly smaller than in the original ships. The capacity of the deck crane in front of the superstructure was increased to 40 tons to allow better handling of ore containers. The stern quarter ramp was also changed to a folding type that would maintain constant pressure on the quay. There were also some changes to the general arrangements of the lowest accommodation deck.<ref name=\"navigator9_84\" />\n\nExternally one of the most noticeable changes in addition to the stern ramp was lowering the lookout post in the bow to improve visibility from the bridge.<ref name=\"navigator9_84\" />\n\n=== Bank Line conversion ===\n\n[[File:Boularibank 20090616.jpg|thumb|left|''Boularibank'' (ex-[[MV Nikel|''Nikel'']]) had a [[bulbous bow]] retrofitted to its icebreaker bow to reduce fuel consumption.]]\n\nThe SA-15 class ships purchased by Andrew Weir Shipping were converted at [[Cammell Laird]] and [[Tyne Tees Dockyard]] for South Pacific service in 1995 by increasing their cargo-carrying capacity and removing specialized icebreaking features in favor of reduced operating costs.\n\nThe conversion consisted of retrofitting a [[bulbous bow]], faired to the existing icebreaker bow, to reduce the wave resistance and replacing the ice-strengthened propeller blades with more efficient highly skewed blades, designed by [[KaMeWa]], to improve speed and fuel consumption. Six double-bottom tanks were converted from bunker to ballast water tanks while nine wing tanks were converted from ballast to heavy fuel oil and two to dedicated heeling tanks. The cargo-carrying capacity of the ships was increased by converting deep tanks between the cargo holds and below the lower deck in the bow for the carriage of vegetable oils. Their maximum allowable draught was increased to {{convert|11.3|m|ft|2|abbr=out}}, which substantially increased the ships' deadweight tonnage. Other changes included upgrading the cargo handling and lifesaving equipment, converting ten cabins for passengers and installing a new [[incinerator]] to deal with the shipboard waste. The stern notch was also no longer needed and thus removed, but the W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 Air Bubbling system was retained for maneuvering.<ref name=\"shiprepair_196\">Innovative Bank Line conversion of former Russian Arctic cargo ships.

Pages 3-4.</ref>\n\nWhen China Navigation Co Ltd bought the South Pacific service from Andrew Weir Shipping in 2006, the four SA-15 class freighters were time chartered by the new owner and further modified during drydocking in Singapore. During the refit an additional W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 Auxpac 6L20 generating set, capable of operating on the same grade of heavy fuel oil as the main engines, was installed alongside the existing smaller 624TS diesel generators and some ballast tanks were converted to heavy fuel oil to increase the bunker capacity. Fuel efficiency was further improved by grit blasting the underwater parts to minimize hull roughness and installing [[wake-equalising duct]]s and a [[rudder bulb]].<ref name=\"shiprepair_106\">Upgrade for Bank Line quartet.

Lebanon's main venue is the [[Camille Chamoun Sports City Stadium]] in [[Beirut]], however they also play in other locations such as the [[Saida International Stadium]] in [[Sidon]].\n\nIn 1934, Lebanon played their first match against the Romanian side [[CA Timi\u0219oara]] (T.A.C.), but it was not ratified by FIFA.

football]] since their inception in 1933. The squad is governed by the [[Asian Football Confederation]] (AFC) continentally, and [[FIFA]] worldwide. While Lebanon have yet to qualify for the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]], they did participated twice in the [[AFC Asian Cup|Asian Cup]]: in [[2000 AFC Asian Cup|2000]], when they hosted the event, and in [[2019 Asian Cup|2019]], the first time through regular qualification. Lebanon's main venue is the [[Camille Chamoun Sports City Stadium]] in [[Beirut]], however they also play in other locations such as the [[Saida International Stadium]] in [[Sidon]].\n\nIn 1934, Lebanon played their first match against the Romanian side [[CA Timi\u0219oara]] (T.A.C.), but it was not ratified by FIFA. [[1940 Mandatory Palestine v Lebanon football match|Lebanon's first FIFA-recognized game]], however, was played in 1940 against [[Mandatory Palestine national football team|Mandatory Palestine]]. During their [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification (AFC)|2014 qualification campaign]] for the World Cup, Lebanon reached the [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification\u2014AFC Fourth Round|fourth round]] of qualifying for the first time thanks to a 2\u20131 victory against [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]] at home in 2011 but failed to qualify for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] by finishing at the bottom of that group. At the [[2019 AFC Asian Cup|2019 Asian Cup]], Lebanon were close to qualifying to the knock-out stages for the first time. However, they lost a tiebreaker to [[Vietnam national football team|Vietnam]] in the [[2019 AFC Asian Cup#Ranking of third-placed teams|third-place ranking]] on the fair play rule and were knocked out of the competition at the group stage. Lebanon also competes in the [[WAFF Championship]], the [[Arab Nations Cup]] and the [[Football at the Pan Arab Games|Pan Arab Games]]. As hosts, they have finished third\u2014once at the Arab Nations Cup and twice at the Pan Arab Games.\n\nInspired by their [[Cedrus libani|national symbol]], the Lebanese team is known as \"the Cedars\" ({{lang-ar|\u0631\u062c\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0631\u0632}}) by fans and media.

As night falls, they stop at a local pub called the Slaughtered Lamb. Jack notices a [[pentagram|five-pointed star]] on the wall, but when he asks about it, the pub-goers stop talking and become hostile. The pair decide to leave, although the pub landlady insists the others should stop them. Instead, the local pub-goers only warn them to keep to the road, stay clear of the moors and beware of the full moon.\n\nDavid and Jack end up wandering off the road onto the moors, where they hear mysterious howls in the distance, which seem to be getting closer. Meanwhile, the crowd in the pub show conflict over letting the boys go, but refuse to go after them. The boys attempt to return to the Slaughtered Lamb but realise that they're now lost but not alone. The boys are suddenly attacked by a vicious creature, whereupon Jack is mauled to death and David is severely injured by the beast. The beast is finally taken down when it is shot and killed by some of the pub-goers, who have finally come out to search for the boys, saving David's life. Instead of the dead animal, David sees the corpse of a naked man lying next to him before he passes out.\n\nDavid is then taken to a hospital in London where he wakes up three weeks later and does not remember what happened. He is interviewed by police Inspector Villiers who tells him that he and Jack were attacked by an escaped lunatic, but David insists they were attacked by some sort of rabid dog or wolf. Jack appears to David as a ghost, and explains the beast that attacked them was a [[werewolf]], revealing that David is now one. Jack urges David to kill himself before the next full moon, not only because Jack is cursed to be a ghost for as long as the bloodline of the werewolf that attacked them survives, but also to prevent David from inflicting the same fate on anyone else.\n\nDavid does not believe him, thinking that Jack is a hallucination. Meanwhile, Dr. Hirsch takes a road trip to the Slaughtered Lamb to see if what David has told him is true. When asked about the incident, the pub-goers deny any knowledge of David, Jack, or the attack. However, one distraught pub-goer speaks to Dr. Hirsch outside the pub and says David should not have been taken away, and that everyone else will be in danger when he transforms. The man is then cut off by a fellow pub-goer.\n\nUpon his release from intensive care, David moves in with Alex Price, a young nurse who grew infatuated with him in the hospital. He stays in Alex's London apartment, where they later have sex for the first time. Jack, in a more advanced stage of decay, appears to David to warn him that he will become a werewolf the next night. Jack again advises David to take his own life to avoid killing innocent people, but David still refuses to believe him and urges him to go away. When the full moon rises, David suddenly feels extremely hot, rips off his clothes and painfully transforms from his human form into a ferocious werewolf. David, now in his werewolf form, begins to prowl around the streets and the [[London Underground]], killing and slaughtering six people in the process. He wakes up the next morning naked on the floor of a wolf enclosure at the [[London Zoo]], unharmed by the resident wolves and with no recollection of what happened. To avoid being seen, he steals balloons from a boy along with a coat and rides back in a bus.\n\nDavid realises that Jack's ghost was right about everything and that he is responsible for the murders the night before. After failing to get himself arrested in [[Trafalgar Square]] and sent to prison, a scared David runs away from Alex. He goes to [[Piccadilly Circus]], calling his family from a phone booth to say he loves them, then loses courage when he attempts and fails to slit his own wrists with a pocket knife. David then suddenly sees Jack, in a yet more advanced stage of decay, outside of an [[adult movie theater]]. Inside, Jack is accompanied by David's victims from the previous night, most of whom are furious with David (although the young couple he murdered appear unfazed). While his ghost victims suggest various and comical ways for David to commit suicide with the least amount of pain, David transforms again into his werewolf form inside the movie theatre and goes on another killing rampage.\n\nAfter crashing out of the cinema and decapitating Inspector Villiers, the werewolf David wreaks havoc in the streets, causing a massive car crash, resulting in many deaths. Finally, he is ultimately trapped and surrounded in an alleyway by the police when Alex suddenly runs down the alley in an attempt to calm David by telling him that she loves him. Although David recognizes her and is apparently calm for a brief moment, he is immediately shot when he lunges forward at the police before he turns back into his human form in front of Alex and dies. She begins to tearfully mourn for the loss of David while staring at him lying dead and naked on the ground.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[David Naughton]] as David Kessler\n* [[Jenny Agutter]] as Nurse Alex Price\n* [[Griffin Dunne]] as Jack Goodman\n* [[John Woodvine]] as Dr J.

He and a Yugoslav member of the crew were driving in the back of a car on location when they came across a group of [[Romani people|gypsies]]. The gypsies appeared to be performing rituals on a man being buried so that he would not \"rise from the grave.\" This made Landis realize he would never be able to confront the undead and gave him the idea for a film in which a man would go through the same thing.<ref>''An Interview with John Landis'' featurette on the ''American Werewolf in London'' [[DVD]]</ref>\n\nLandis wrote the first draft of ''An American Werewolf in London'' in 1969 and shelved it for over a decade. Two years later, Landis wrote, directed, and starred in his debut film, ''[[Schlock (film)|Schlock]]'', which developed a cult following. Landis developed box-office status in Hollywood through the successful [[comedy film]]s ''[[The Kentucky Fried Movie]]'', ''[[Animal House|National Lampoon's Animal House]]'' and ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'' before securing $10 million financing from [[PolyGram Filmed Entertainment|PolyGram Pictures]] for his werewolf film.

Jack notices a [[pentagram|five-pointed star]] on the wall, but when he asks about it, the pub-goers stop talking and become hostile.

Meanwhile, the crowd in the pub show conflict over letting the boys go, but refuse to go after them. The boys attempt to return to the Slaughtered Lamb but realise that they're now lost but not alone. The boys are suddenly attacked by a vicious creature, whereupon Jack is mauled to death and David is severely injured by the beast. The beast is finally taken down when it is shot and killed by some of the pub-goers, who have finally come out to search for the boys, saving David's life. Instead of the dead animal, David sees the corpse of a naked man lying next to him before he passes out.\n\nDavid is then taken to a hospital in London where he wakes up three weeks later and does not remember what happened. He is interviewed by police Inspector Villiers who tells him that he and Jack were attacked by an escaped lunatic, but David insists they were attacked by some sort of rabid dog or wolf. Jack appears to David as a ghost, and explains the beast that attacked them was a [[werewolf]], revealing that David is now one. Jack urges David to kill himself before the next full moon, not only because Jack is cursed to be a ghost for as long as the bloodline of the werewolf that attacked them survives, but also to prevent David from inflicting the same fate on anyone else.\n\nDavid does not believe him, thinking that Jack is a hallucination. Meanwhile, Dr. Hirsch takes a road trip to the Slaughtered Lamb to see if what David has told him is true. When asked about the incident, the pub-goers deny any knowledge of David, Jack, or the attack. However, one distraught pub-goer speaks to Dr. Hirsch outside the pub and says David should not have been taken away, and that everyone else will be in danger when he transforms. The man is then cut off by a fellow pub-goer.\n\nUpon his release from intensive care, David moves in with Alex Price, a young nurse who grew infatuated with him in the hospital. He stays in Alex's London apartment, where they later have sex for the first time. Jack, in a more advanced stage of decay, appears to David to warn him that he will become a werewolf the next night. Jack again advises David to take his own life to avoid killing innocent people, but David still refuses to believe him and urges him to go away. When the full moon rises, David suddenly feels extremely hot, rips off his clothes and painfully transforms from his human form into a ferocious werewolf. David, now in his werewolf form, begins to prowl around the streets and the [[London Underground]], killing and slaughtering six people in the process. He wakes up the next morning naked on the floor of a wolf enclosure at the [[London Zoo]], unharmed by the resident wolves and with no recollection of what happened. To avoid being seen, he steals balloons from a boy along with a coat and rides back in a bus.\n\nDavid realises that Jack's ghost was right about everything and that he is responsible for the murders the night before. After failing to get himself arrested in [[Trafalgar Square]] and sent to prison, a scared David runs away from Alex. He goes to [[Piccadilly Circus]], calling his family from a phone booth to say he loves them, then loses courage when he attempts and fails to slit his own wrists with a pocket knife. David then suddenly sees Jack, in a yet more advanced stage of decay, outside of an [[adult movie theater]]. Inside, Jack is accompanied by David's victims from the previous night, most of whom are furious with David (although the young couple he murdered appear unfazed). While his ghost victims suggest various and comical ways for David to commit suicide with the least amount of pain, David transforms again into his werewolf form inside the movie theatre and goes on another killing rampage.\n\nAfter crashing out of the cinema and decapitating Inspector Villiers, the werewolf David wreaks havoc in the streets, causing a massive car crash, resulting in many deaths. Finally, he is ultimately trapped and surrounded in an alleyway by the police when Alex suddenly runs down the alley in an attempt to calm David by telling him that she loves him. Although David recognizes her and is apparently calm for a brief moment, he is immediately shot when he lunges forward at the police before he turns back into his human form in front of Alex and dies. She begins to tearfully mourn for the loss of David while staring at him lying dead and naked on the ground.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[David Naughton]] as David Kessler\n* [[Jenny Agutter]] as Nurse Alex Price\n* [[Griffin Dunne]] as Jack Goodman\n* [[John Woodvine]] as Dr J.

The [[Islamist]] parties and some mainstream parties sided together to persecution of Ahmadis.\n\n==Background and Reasons==\n\n{{main|1953 Lahore riots|}}\nOne of the major controversial differences between [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]] and mainstream [[Sunni]] and [[Shia Muslims]] is their different interpretations of [[Khatam an-Nabiyyin]]. Muslim world is explicit on the finality of the prophethood of [[Muhammad]] whereas Ahmadiyya community consider [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]] as an Ummati Nabi. Sunni and Shia Muslims are awaiting the coming of the [[Mahdi]] and the [[Second Coming]] of Jesus reject the claims of [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]] whom Ahmadis believe to be the Promised Messiah and Mahdi. The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community was a vocal proponent of the [[Pakistan Movement]] and were actively engaged with the [[Muslim League (Pakistan)|Muslim league]], having strong relations with many prominent Muslim Leaguers and were opposed to the Congress-backed [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]] and [[Majlis-e-Ahrar-ul-Islam]].\nAfter the independence of [[Pakistan]] in 1947 Ahmadis prospered and reached many high ranking Government and Military positions. Ahmadis held up stay as an important political force in Pakistan, but by 1970 religious parties made large headway due to radicalization and [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]] financial contributions and were a large political force in Pakistan. These parties continuously demanded a constitutional amendment to declare Ahmadis as non Muslims but to no avail, and turned turned to violent protests and hate-filled speeches, including the infamous [[1953 Lahore riots]]. In 1974, the students of [[Nishtar Medical College]] had an altercation with Ahmadis at the Rabwah Railway Station. This event turned into a massive and violent anti-Ahmadiyya riot resulting in many casualties among Ahmadis and destruction to Ahmadiyya property.<ref>[http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/hrj/iss16/khan.shtml Persecution of the Ahmadiyya Community in Pakistan: An Analysis Under International Law and International Relations] ''Harvard Human Rights Journal'', Vol 16, September 2003</ref>. \nSoon after this mass disturbance that spreaded in length and breadth of the country, a motion was tabled on floor of the National Assembly of Pakistan to declare [[Ahmadiyya]] as a Non-Muslim community. The leader of Jamaat, '''Mirza Nasir Ahmed''' voluntarily appeared before special committe comprising complete parliament, to present point of view of the Jamaat in front of the Parliament of Pakistan<ref>https://ia801309.us.archive.org/30/items/NAProceedings1974/NA-Proceeding-1974.pdf</ref>. The parliament after listening to the arguments of Ahmediyya delegation, streching for eleven full days, declared them Non-Muslim Community on 7 Seprember 1974 through Pakistan's [[Second Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan|Second Amendment to the Constitution]]<ref name=\"2ndamend\">{{cite web |title=Constitution (Second Amendment) Act, 1974 |url=http://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/constitution/amendments/2amendment.html |website=The Constitution of Pakistan |publisher=pakistani.org |accessdate=21 January 2020}}</ref> [[Ordinance XX]]. \n\n==Timeline of events==\n\nThe riots were started by the students of [[Nishtar Medical College]] Multan attack on Ahmadis present in [[Rabwah|Rabwah Railway Station]].

The [[Islamist]] parties and some mainstream parties sided together to persecution of Ahmadis.\n\n==Background and Reasons==\n\n{{main|1953 Lahore riots|}}\nOne of the major controversial differences between [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]] and mainstream [[Sunni]] and [[Shia Muslims]] is their different interpretations of [[Khatam an-Nabiyyin]]. Muslim world is explicit on the finality of the prophethood of [[Muhammad]] whereas Ahmadiyya community consider [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]] as an Ummati Nabi. Sunni and Shia Muslims are awaiting the coming of the [[Mahdi]] and the [[Second Coming]] of Jesus reject the claims of [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]] whom Ahmadis believe to be the Promised Messiah and Mahdi. The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community was a vocal proponent of the [[Pakistan Movement]] and were actively engaged with the [[Muslim League (Pakistan)|Muslim league]], having strong relations with many prominent Muslim Leaguers and were opposed to the Congress-backed [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]] and [[Majlis-e-Ahrar-ul-Islam]].\nAfter the independence of [[Pakistan]] in 1947 Ahmadis prospered and reached many high ranking Government and Military positions. Ahmadis held up stay as an important political force in Pakistan, but by 1970 religious parties made large headway due to radicalization and [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]] financial contributions and were a large political force in Pakistan. These parties continuously demanded a constitutional amendment to declare Ahmadis as non Muslims but to no avail, and turned turned to violent protests and hate-filled speeches, including the infamous [[1953 Lahore riots]]. In 1974, the students of [[Nishtar Medical College]] had an altercation with Ahmadis at the Rabwah Railway Station. This event turned into a massive and violent anti-Ahmadiyya riot resulting in many casualties among Ahmadis and destruction to Ahmadiyya property.<ref>[http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/hrj/iss16/khan.shtml Persecution of the Ahmadiyya Community in Pakistan: An Analysis Under International Law and International Relations] ''Harvard Human Rights Journal'', Vol 16, September 2003</ref>\n\n==Timeline of events==\n\nThe riots were started by the students of [[Nishtar Medical College]] Multan attack on Ahmadis present in [[Rabwah|Rabwah Railway Station]].

His father was born in Pittsburgh during the [[Great Depression]]. Born in [[Guayaquil, Ecuador]], his mother emigrated from Bogot\u00e1, Colombia in 1963. At the age of two, Kilwein Guevara moved with his parents and brothers from Colombia to Pittsburgh, [[Pennsylvania]], first living with his paternal grandparents in the [[Hazelwood (Pittsburgh)|Hazelwood neighborhood]], then home to the [[Jones and Laughlin Steel Company|Jones and Laughlin Coke Works]]. Of those early experiences, Kilwein Guevara has noted:\n\n<blockquote>I was six or seven and listening to the immigrants and the natives and the migrants (some transplants from Germany, Italy, Colombia, Ireland, Poland, Hungary, Jim Crow Alabama, Mississippi, and Mexico by way of [[Weirton, West Virginia]]). To speak with an accent, to speak another language, to coexist giddily with tongues I didn't understand, to listen for tenor, to study how people laughed at the deli or pointed at the bread counter, to imitate how we learn to injure or sooth, to laugh or cry, this was quotidian.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite book |last=Kilwein Guevara |first=Mauricio |editor1-last=Rankine |editor1-first=Claudia |editor2-last=Dowdy |editor2-first=Michael |title=American Poets in the 21st Century: Poetics of Social Engagement |publisher=Wesleyan University Press |date=2018 |pages=267\u2013294 |chapter= Mauricio Kilwein Guevara |isbn=978-0-8195-7830-3}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nBy the age of seven, Kilwein Guevara and his family had resided in six different rental properties in [[Latin America]], [[Baltimore]], and Pittsburgh.

His father was born in Pittsburgh during the [[Great Depression]]. Born in [[Guayaquil, Ecuador]], his mother emigrated from Bogot\u00e1, Colombia in 1963. At the age of two, Kilwein Guevara moved with his parents and brothers from Colombia to Pittsburgh, [[Pennsylvania]], first living with his paternal grandparents in the [[Hazelwood (Pittsburgh)|Hazelwood neighborhood]], then home to the [[Jones and Laughlin Steel Company|Jones and Laughlin Coke Works]]. Of those early experiences, Kilwein Guevara has noted:\n\n<blockquote>I was six or seven and listening to the immigrants and the natives and the migrants (some transplants from Germany, Italy, Colombia, Ireland, Poland, Hungary, Jim Crow Alabama, Mississippi, and Mexico by way of [[Weirton, West Virginia]]). To speak with an accent, to speak another language, to coexist giddily with tongues I didn't understand, to listen for tenor, to study how people laughed at the deli or pointed at the bread counter, to imitate how we learn to injure or sooth, to laugh or cry, this was quotidian.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite book |last=Kilwein Guevara |first=Mauricio |editor1-last=Rankine |editor1-first=Claudia |editor2-last=Dowdy |editor2-first=Michael |title=American Poets in the 21st Century: Poetics of Social Engagement |publisher=Wesleyan University Press |date=2018 |pages=267\u2013294 |chapter= Mauricio Kilwein Guevara |isbn=978-0-8195-7830-3}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nBy the age of seven, Kilwein Guevara and his family had resided in six different rental properties in [[Latin America]], [[Baltimore]], and Pittsburgh.
