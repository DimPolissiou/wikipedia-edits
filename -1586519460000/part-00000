The rejection by the affected people was covered by the mass media. The reason people rejected the planned YIA was the construction of the airport would eliminate the land that is the source of their livelihood as farmers. They also claimed about environmental issues with the proposed site as well as issues of safety, due to the area being at high risk for tsunamis and other natural disasters.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.liputan6.com/bisnis/read/2101311/sosialisasi-bandara-kulonprogo-yogya-mulai-senin-8-september|title=Sosialisasi Bandara Kulonprogo Yogya Mulai Senin 8 September|newspaper=Liputan 6|accessdate=14 December 2018|via=}}</ref> In addition there are a few historic as well as scared places for local community with the airport development area. The rejection of the YIA development has begun since the establishment of the Wahana Tri Tunggal (WTT).

Initially, the attitude of refusing unconditionally became the principle of the WTT towards the construction of the YIA, until finally they accepted the construction provided that there was a reassessment of the assets of buildings, plants and other supporting facilities.

Dissemination of YIA development was carried out by the Regional Government and related Offices, PT Angkasa Pura I, and the National Land Agency (BPN) of Kulon Progo Regency in 2014. The rejection by the affected people was covered by the mass media. The reason people rejected the planned YIA was the construction of the airport would eliminate the land that is the source of their livelihood as farmers. They also claimed about environmental issues with the proposed site as well as issues of safety, due to the area being at high risk for tsunamis and other natural disasters.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.liputan6.com/bisnis/read/2101311/sosialisasi-bandara-kulonprogo-yogya-mulai-senin-8-september|title=Sosialisasi Bandara Kulonprogo Yogya Mulai Senin 8 September|newspaper=Liputan 6|accessdate=14 December 2018|via=}}</ref> In addition there are a few historic as well as scared places for local community with the airport development area.

Initially, the attitude of refusing unconditionally became the principle of the WTT towards the construction of the YIA, until finally they accepted the construction provided that there was a reassessment of the assets of buildings, plants and other supporting facilities.

It has contributed to stability on the Korean Peninsula, cultivated a more cooperative relationship with members of the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN) ([[Brunei]], [[Cambodia]], [[Burma]], [[Indonesia]], [[Laos]], [[Malaysia]], [[Philippines]], [[Singapore]], [[Thailand]], [[Vietnam]]), and participated in the [[Member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations#ASEAN Regional Forum|ASEAN Regional Forum]]. In 1997, the ASEAN member nations and China, South Korea and Japan agreed to hold yearly talks to further strengthen regional cooperation, the [[ASEAN Free Trade Area#ASEAN Plus Three|ASEAN Plus Three]] meetings. In 2005, the \"ASEAN Plus Three\" countries together with [[India]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] held the inaugural [[East Asia Summit]] (EAS). Relations have improved with Vietnam since a border war was fought with the one-time close ally in 1979. A [[Territorial disputes in the South China Sea|territorial dispute]] with its Southeast Asian neighbors over islands in the [[South China Sea]] remains unresolved, as does another dispute in the [[East China Sea]] with Japan.

[[Vladimir Putin]] and [[Jiang Zemin]], in large part to serve as a counterbalance to the [[United States|U.S.]], signed a [[2001 Sino-Russian Treaty of Friendship|Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation]] in July 2001. The two also joined with the Central Asian countries of [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Tajikistan]], and [[Uzbekistan]] to found the [[Shanghai Cooperation Organisation]] (SCO) in June 2001. The SCO is designed to promote regional stability and cooperate to combat terrorism in the region.\n\n[[China\u2013India relations|Relations with India]] have also improved considerably. After years of competition, general distrust between the two (mostly over China's close relationship with Pakistan and India's with the [[Post-Soviet states|former Soviet Union]]) and a border war, relations in the 21st century between the world's two most populous states have never been more harmonious, as they have started to collaborate in several economic and strategic areas. Both countries have doubled their economic trade in the past few years, and China became India's largest trading partner in 2010. The two countries are planning to host joint naval exercises. In 2003, China and India held negotiations for the first time since the [[Sino-Indian War]] of 1962 on a major border dispute: however, the dispute over [[Aksai Chin]] (formerly a part of the Indian state of [[Jammu and Kashmir]]) and [[South Tibet]] (China) or [[Arunachal Pradesh]] (India) is not settled and plagues Sino-Indian relations.

This assessment of U.S. power was reconsidered after the U.S. intervention in [[Kosovo]], and as the 20th century drew to a close, the discussion among [[think tank]]s in China involved how to reorient Chinese foreign policy in a unipolar world.  This discussion also occurred in the context of China's [[new security concept]], which argued that the post\u2013Cold War era required nations to move away from thinking in terms of alliances and power blocs and toward thinking in terms of economic and diplomatic cooperation.\n\n[[File:20041120-1 bushchinamtg-1-515h.jpg|thumb|[[Hu Jintao]] of China and [[George W.

China was instrumental at brokering talks with North Korea over its nuclear program, and in 2003, there was a concerted effort by China to improve relations with the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations|ASEAN]] countries and form a common East Asian market. These foreign policy efforts have been part of a general foreign policy initiative known as [[China's peaceful rise]]. On 15 November 2005, Hu Jintao visited Seoul and spoke of the importance of both countries' contributions for regional peace and cooperation in economic development.\n\nHowever, China's opposition to the bid of two of its important neighbors\u2014India and Japan\u2014to become permanent members of the [[United Nations Security Council]] has proved to be an irritant in their respective relationships. Japan, with its large economic and cultural influences in Asia, is seen by China as its most formidable opponent and partner in regional diplomacy. The two sides established diplomatic relations in 1972, and Japanese investment in China was important in the early years of China's economic reforms and ever since.\n\n===21st century===\nAt a national meeting on diplomatic work in August 2004, China's [[paramount leader]] [[Hu Jintao]] reiterated that China will continue its \"independent foreign policy of peaceful development,\" stressing the need for a peaceful and stable international environment, especially among China's neighbors, that will foster \"mutually beneficial cooperation\" and \"common development.\" This policy line has varied little in intent since the People's Republic was established in 1949, but the rhetoric has varied in its stridency to reflect periods of domestic political upheaval.\n\nIn 2007, Foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gang made a statement about the eight-point diplomatic philosophy of China:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2007/mar/01/20070301-104826-2978r/|title=Beijing likens Cheney criticism to nosy neighbor|work=The Washingtion Times|accessdate=19 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219202935/http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2007/mar/01/20070301-104826-2978r/|archive-date=19 February 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping (2019-06-05) 57.jpg|thumb|Chinese President [[Xi Jinping]] presented [[Panda diplomacy|two pandas]] to [[Moscow Zoo]] at a ceremony with [[Vladimir Putin]] on 5 June 2019]]\n\n#China will not seek hegemony.

China advocates stepping up international cooperation and is against unilateral politics. China should not undermine the dignity and the authority of the U.N. China should not impose and set its own wishes above the U.N. Charter, international law and norms.\n#China advocates peaceful negotiation and consultation so as to resolve its international disputes. China does not resort to force, or threat of force, in resolving international disputes. China maintains a reasonable national military buildup to defend its own sovereignty and territorial integrity. It is not made to expand, nor does it seek invasion or aggression.\n#China is firmly opposed to terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. China is a responsible member of the international community, and as for international treaties, China abides by all them in a faithful way. China never plays by a double standard, selecting and discarding treaties it does not need.\n#China respects the diversity of the civilization and the whole world. China advocates different cultures make exchanges, learn from each other, and complement one another with their own strengths. China is opposed to clashes and confrontations between civilizations, and China does not link any particular ethnic group or religion with terrorism.\n\nIn 2011, Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi outlined plans for an \"integrated approach\" that would serve China's economic development.<ref>Ho, Stephanie.

South Korea was the last Asian country to establish relations with the People's Republic of China. In recent years, China and South Korea have endeavored to boost their strategic and cooperative partnership in numerous sectors, as well as promoting high level relationship. Trade, tourism and multiculturalism, in specific, have been the most important factors of strengthening two neighbouring countries cooperative partnership.\n\nWhile the dispute of [[THAAD]] had initiated conflicts between the two countries in various sectors, at the end of October 2017, the two countries ended the 1-year-long diplomatic dispute and have been working swiftly to get their relationship back on track since, strengthening exchanges and cooperation between each other, creating harmony of interests, and agreed to resume exchanges and cooperation in all areas. All economic and cultural bans from China towards South Korea were also lifted as a result, with political and security cooperation, businesses and cultural exchanges between the two countries getting back to healthy state.\n\nUpon resumption of relationship, China and South Korea have been organizing presidential and governmental visits, working together on the [[Korean Peninsula]], assisting with the development of other countries, and cooperating in numerous areas.\n{{main|China\u2013South Korea relations}}\n\n====South Asia====\nChina's current trade volume with all [[South Asia]]n nations reaches close to US$20 billion a year.\n\nBeijing runs [[Balance of trade|trade surplus]]es with many partners, including [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Nepal]] and [[Sri Lanka]].

After the 1991 demise of the [[Soviet Union]], China's relations with [[Russia]] and the former states of the Soviet Union became more amicable as the conflicting ideologies of the two vast nations no longer stood in the way. A new round of bilateral agreements was signed during reciprocal head of state visits. As in the early 1950s with the Soviet Union, Russia has again become an important source of [[military technology]] for China, as well as for [[raw material]]s and [[trade]]. Friendly relations with Russia have been an important advantage for China, offsetting its often uneasy relations with the U.S. Relations with Europe, both Eastern and Western, generally have been friendly in the early 21st century, and, indeed, close political and trade relations with the [[European Union]] nations have been a major thrust of China's foreign policy in the 2000s.

The Pacific is an area of intense and continuous diplomatic competition between the PRC and the ROC, with several countries ([[Nauru]], [[Kiribati]], Vanuatu) having switched diplomatic support from one to the other at least once. Both the PRC and the ROC provide development aid to their respective allies. the PRC also wants to establish a preeminent [[sphere of influence]] in the Pacific Islands.\n\n====Policy====\nIn 2003, China announced it intended to enhance its diplomatic ties with the [[Pacific Islands Forum]], and increase the economic aid package it provided to that organisation.

It has contributed to stability on the Korean Peninsula, cultivated a more cooperative relationship with members of the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN) ([[Brunei]], [[Cambodia]], [[Burma]], [[Indonesia]], [[Laos]], [[Malaysia]], [[Philippines]], [[Singapore]], [[Thailand]], [[Vietnam]]), and participated in the [[Member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations#ASEAN Regional Forum|ASEAN Regional Forum]]. In 1997, the ASEAN member nations and China, South Korea and Japan agreed to hold yearly talks to further strengthen regional cooperation, the [[ASEAN Free Trade Area#ASEAN Plus Three|ASEAN Plus Three]] meetings. In 2005, the \"ASEAN Plus Three\" countries together with [[India]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] held the inaugural [[East Asia Summit]] (EAS). Relations have improved with Vietnam since a border war was fought with the one-time close ally in 1979. A [[Territorial disputes in the South China Sea|territorial dispute]] with its Southeast Asian neighbors over islands in the [[South China Sea]] remains unresolved, as does another dispute in the [[East China Sea]] with Japan.

[[Vladimir Putin]] and [[Jiang Zemin]], in large part to serve as a counterbalance to the [[United States|U.S.]], signed a [[2001 Sino-Russian Treaty of Friendship|Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation]] in July 2001. The two also joined with the Central Asian countries of [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Tajikistan]], and [[Uzbekistan]] to found the [[Shanghai Cooperation Organisation]] (SCO) in June 2001. The SCO is designed to promote regional stability and cooperate to combat terrorism in the region.\n\n[[China\u2013India relations|Relations with India]] have also improved considerably. After years of competition, general distrust between the two (mostly over China's close relationship with Pakistan and India's with the [[Post-Soviet states|former Soviet Union]]) and a border war, relations in the 21st century between the world's two most populous states have never been more harmonious, as they have started to collaborate in several economic and strategic areas. Both countries have doubled their economic trade in the past few years, and China became India's largest trading partner in 2010. The two countries are planning to host joint naval exercises. In 2003, China and India held negotiations for the first time since the [[Sino-Indian War]] of 1962 on a major border dispute: however, the dispute over [[Aksai Chin]] (formerly a part of the Indian state of [[Jammu and Kashmir]]) and [[South Tibet]] (China) or [[Arunachal Pradesh]] (India) is not settled and plagues Sino-Indian relations.

This assessment of U.S. power was reconsidered after the U.S. intervention in [[Kosovo]], and as the 20th century drew to a close, the discussion among [[think tank]]s in China involved how to reorient Chinese foreign policy in a unipolar world.  This discussion also occurred in the context of China's [[new security concept]], which argued that the post\u2013Cold War era required nations to move away from thinking in terms of alliances and power blocs and toward thinking in terms of economic and diplomatic cooperation.\n\n[[File:20041120-1 bushchinamtg-1-515h.jpg|thumb|[[Hu Jintao]] of China and [[George W.

China was instrumental at brokering talks with North Korea over its nuclear program, and in 2003, there was a concerted effort by China to improve relations with the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations|ASEAN]] countries and form a common East Asian market. These foreign policy efforts have been part of a general foreign policy initiative known as [[China's peaceful rise]]. On 15 November 2005, Hu Jintao visited Seoul and spoke of the importance of both countries' contributions for regional peace and cooperation in economic development.\n\nHowever, China's opposition to the bid of two of its important neighbors\u2014India and Japan\u2014to become permanent members of the [[United Nations Security Council]] has proved to be an irritant in their respective relationships. Japan, with its large economic and cultural influences in Asia, is seen by China as its most formidable opponent and partner in regional diplomacy. The two sides established diplomatic relations in 1972, and Japanese investment in China was important in the early years of China's economic reforms and ever since.\n\n===21st century===\nAt a national meeting on diplomatic work in August 2004, China's [[paramount leader]] [[Hu Jintao]] reiterated that China will continue its \"independent foreign policy of peaceful development,\" stressing the need for a peaceful and stable international environment, especially among China's neighbors, that will foster \"mutually beneficial cooperation\" and \"common development.\" This policy line has varied little in intent since the People's Republic was established in 1949, but the rhetoric has varied in its stridency to reflect periods of domestic political upheaval.\n\nIn 2007, Foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gang made a statement about the eight-point diplomatic philosophy of China:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2007/mar/01/20070301-104826-2978r/|title=Beijing likens Cheney criticism to nosy neighbor|work=The Washingtion Times|accessdate=19 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219202935/http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2007/mar/01/20070301-104826-2978r/|archive-date=19 February 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping (2019-06-05) 57.jpg|thumb|Chinese President [[Xi Jinping]] presented [[Panda diplomacy|two pandas]] to [[Moscow Zoo]] at a ceremony with [[Vladimir Putin]] on 5 June 2019]]\n\n#China will not seek hegemony.

China advocates stepping up international cooperation and is against unilateral politics. China should not undermine the dignity and the authority of the U.N. China should not impose and set its own wishes above the U.N.

China does not resort to force, or threat of force, in resolving international disputes. China maintains a reasonable national military buildup to defend its own sovereignty and territorial integrity. It is not made to expand, nor does it seek invasion or aggression.\n#China is firmly opposed to terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. China is a responsible member of the international community, and as for international treaties, China abides by all them in a faithful way. China never plays by a double standard, selecting and discarding treaties it does not need.\n#China respects the diversity of the civilization and the whole world. China advocates different cultures make exchanges, learn from each other, and complement one another with their own strengths. China is opposed to clashes and confrontations between civilizations, and China does not link any particular ethnic group or religion with terrorism.\n\nIn 2011, Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi outlined plans for an \"integrated approach\" that would serve China's economic development.<ref>Ho, Stephanie.

The Republic of China which views itself as the successor state of the Qing Dynasty did not renounce any territory which fell under de facto control of other states (i.e. Mongolia), but has largely been a non-participant in enforcing these claims. The People's Republic of China which inherited the claims has settled a number of such disputes with Mongolia and Russia via bilateral treaties, not recognized by the Republic of China. In this respect, the territorial disputes between the PRC and neighboring countries may be considered a subset of those between the ROC and said countries.\n\nBloomberg News reports that these disputes are undermining China's attempts to charm its neighbors away from American influence.<ref>Forsythe, Michael and Sakamaki, Sachiko [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-09-26/china-s-asian-charm-offensive-in-shambles-over-disputes-with-neighbors.html China's Asian Charm Offensive in `Shambles' Over Disputes With Neighbors] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103180245/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-09-26/china-s-asian-charm-offensive-in-shambles-over-disputes-with-neighbors.html |date=3 November 2012 }} Bloomberg News, 26 September 2010</ref> China has come to rely more on military power to resolve these disputes.

The letter is [[collation|collated]] together with ''U'', or as ''UE''. In languages that have adopted German names or spellings, such as [[Swedish (language)|Swedish]], the letter also occurs. It is however not a part of these languages' alphabets. In [[Swedish language|Swedish]] the letter is called ''tyskt y'' which means ''German y''.\n\nIn other languages that do not have the letter as part of the regular alphabet or in limited [[character set]]s such as [[ASCII]], U-umlaut is frequently replaced with the two-letter combination \"'''ue'''\". Software for [[optical character recognition]] sometimes sees it falsely as ''ii''.\n\n== Letter \u00dc ==\n\nThe letter '''\u00dc''' is present in the [[Hungarian alphabet|Hungarian]], [[French alphabet|French]], [[Turkish alphabet|Turkish]], [[Uyghur Latin alphabet|Uyghur Latin]], [[Estonian alphabet|Estonian]], [[Azeri alphabet|Azeri]], [[Turkmen alphabet|Turkmen]], [[Crimean Tatar alphabet|Crimean Tatar]], [[Kazakh alphabet|Kazakh Latin]] and [[Tatar alphabet|Tatar Latin]] [[alphabet]]s, where it represents a [[close front rounded vowel]] {{IPA|[y]}}. It is considered a distinct letter, [[Collation|collated]] separately, not a simple modification of U or Y, and is distinct from ''UE''.\n\nIn the [[Swedish alphabet|Swedish]] and [[Finnish alphabet]]s ''\u00fc'' is alphabetized as ''y''.\n\nThis same letter appears in the [[Chinese language|Chinese]] [[Romanisation]]s [[pinyin]], [[Wade-Giles]], and the German-based [[Lessing-Othmer]], where it represents the same sound {{IPA|[y]}}: \u7da0/l\u00fc (green) or \u5973/n\u00fc (female). Standard [[Mandarin Chinese]] pronunciation has both the sounds {{IPA|[y]}} and {{IPA|[u]}}. Pinyin only uses \"\u00dc\" to represent {{IPA|[y]}} after the letters \"L\" or \"N\" to avoid confusion with words such as \u8def/lu (road) and \u6012/nu (anger). Words such as \u7389/yu (jade) or \u53e5/ju (sentence) are pronounced with {{IPA|[y]}}, but are not spelled with \"\u00dc\", although Wade-Giles and Lessing use \"\u00dc\" in all situations. As the letter \"\u00dc\" is missing on most keyboards and the letter \"V\" is not present in standard Mandarin pinyin, the letter \"V\" is used on most computer Chinese input methods to enter the letter \"\u00dc\". As a result, romanisation of Chinese with the letter \"V\" representing the \u00dc sound is sometimes found. However, \u00dc sound should be officially represented by \"yu\" in Pinyin when it's difficult to enter \u00dc. For example, the surname L\u00fc (\u5415) would be written as \"Lyu\" in the passports.<ref>[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/hqzx/2012-10/11/content_15809608.htm \u65b0\u7248\u62a4\u7167\u201c\u5415\u201d\u59d3\u6539\u62fc\u201cLYU\u201d \u82f1\u6587\u65e0\u00fc\u88ab\u66ff\u4ee3]. Beijing Daily. 2012-10-11.</ref>\n\n== U-diaeresis ==\n\nSeveral languages use [[diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] over the letter '''U''' to show that the letter is pronounced in its regular way, without dropping out, building [[diphthong]]s with neighbours, etc.\n\nIn [[Spanish language|Spanish]], it is used to distinguish between \"gue\"/\"g\u00fce\" {{IPA|[\u0261e]}}/{{IPA|[\u0261we]}} and \"gui\"/\"g\u00fci\" {{IPA|[\u0261i]}}/{{IPA|[\u0261wi]}}: ''nicarag\u00fcense'' (\"Nicaraguan\"), ''ping\u00fcino'' (\"penguin\").\n\nSimilarly in [[Catalan language|Catalan]], \"gue~g\u00fce\" are {{IPA|[\u0261e]}}~{{IPA|[\u0261we]}}, \"gui~g\u00fci\" are {{IPA|[\u0261i]}}~{{IPA|[\u0261wi]}}, \"que~q\u00fce\" are {{IPA|[ke]}}~{{IPA|[kwe]}} and \"qui~q\u00fci\" are {{IPA|[ki]}}~{{IPA|[kwi]}}, \nas in ''aig\u00fces'', ''ping\u00fcins'', ''q\u00fcesti\u00f3'', ''adeq\u00fci''. Also, ''\u00fc'' is used to mark that vowel pairs that normally would form a diphthong must be pronounced as separate syllables, examples: ''Ra\u00fcl'', ''di\u00fcrn''.\n\nIn French, the diaeresis appears over the \"u\" only very rarely, in some uncommon words, ''capharna\u00fcm'' {{IPA|[-a\u0254m]}} ('shambles'), ''[[Capernaum|Capharna\u00fcm/Caperna\u00fcm]]'' {{IPA|[-a\u0254m]}} or ''[[Emmaus|Emma\u00fcs]]'' {{IPA|[-ays]}}. After the [[French orthography#Accents|1990 spelling reforms]], it is applied to a few more words, like  ''aig'''\u00fc'''e'' (formerly ''aigu'''\u00eb'''''), ''ambig'''\u00fc'''e'' (formerly ''ambigu'''\u00eb''''') and ''arg'''\u00fc'''er'' {{IPA|[a\u0281\u0261\u0265e]}} (formerly without the diaeresis).\n\n== Usage in phonetic alphabets ==\nIn the [[Rheinische Dokumenta]], a phonetic alphabet for many [[West Central German]], the [[Low Rhenish]], and few related [[vernacular]] languages, \"\u00fc\" represents a range from {{IPAblink|y}} to {{IPAblink|\u028f}}.\n\n== Typography ==\nHistorically the unique letter ''\u00dc'' and U-diaeresis were written as a ''U'' with two dots above the letter. U-umlaut was written as a ''U'' with a small ''e'' written above: this minute ''e'' degenerated to two vertical bars in [[medieval]] [[handwriting]]s. In most later handwritings these bars in turn nearly became dots.\n\nIn modern [[typography]] there was insufficient space on [[typewriter]]s and later [[computer keyboard]]s to allow for both a U-with-dots (also representing ''\u00dc'') and a U-with-bars. Since they looked near-identical the two glyphs were combined, which was also done in computer [[character encoding]]s such as [[ISO 8859-1]]. As a result, there was no way to differentiate between the three different characters.

It is classified as a separate letter in several extended [[Latin alphabet]]s (including [[Azeri alphabet|Azeri]], [[Estonian alphabet|Estonian]], [[Hungarian alphabet|Hungarian]] and [[Turkish alphabet|Turkish]]), but as the letter '''[[U]]'''  with an [[Umlaut (diacritic)|umlaut]]/[[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] in others such as [[Catalan alphabet|Catalan]], [[French alphabet|French]], [[Galician alphabet|Galician]], [[German alphabet|German]], [[Occitan alphabet|Occitan]] and [[Spanish alphabet|Spanish]]. Although not a part of their alphabet, it also appears in languages such as [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] when retained in foreign names and words,{{Example needed |date=November 2019}} and Finnish and Swedish spells said letter and sound in domestic words solely as [[Y]].

Born in [[Clifton, Bristol]], he graduated from the [[University of Paris]] in 1894, and travelled to the [[Transvaal Colony]] where, as a member of [[Milner's Kindergarten]], he became Director of Education. Ware next became editor of the [[The Morning Post|''Morning Post'']], being fired in 1911 after several controversies.\n\nWhen the [[First World War]] started in August 1914, Ware attempted to join the [[British Army]] but was rejected because he was too old. With the assistance of [[Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner|Lord Milner]], he obtained command of a mobile [[ambulance]] unit provided by the [[British Red Cross Society]]. In this role he began marking and recording the graves of those killed. Ware and his graves' registration organization were transferred to the [[British Army]] in 1915. This was to become the Imperial War Graves Commission. Ware ended the war as a major general, having been [[mentioned in despatches]] twice and continued to work with the commission. In [[World War II]], he was appointed director-general of Graves Registration and Enquiries.

Born in [[Clifton, Bristol]], he graduated from the [[University of Paris]] in 1894, and travelled to the [[Transvaal Colony]] where, as a member of [[Milner's Kindergarten]], he became Director of Education. Ware next became editor of the [[The Morning Post|''Morning Post'']], being fired in 1911 after several controversies.\n\nWhen the [[First World War]] started in August 1914, Ware attempted to join the [[British Army]] but was rejected because he was too old. With the assistance of [[Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner|Lord Milner]], he obtained command of a mobile [[ambulance]] unit provided by the [[British Red Cross Society]]. In this role he began marking and recording the graves of those killed. Ware and his graves' registration organization were transferred to the [[British Army]] in 1915. This was to become the Imperial War Graves Commission. Ware ended the war as a major general, having been [[mentioned in despatches]] twice and continued to work with the commission. In [[World War II]], he was appointed director-general of Graves Registration and Enquiries. He fully retired in 1948, and died the following year.\n==Early life==\nWare was born in [[Clifton, Bristol]] on 17 June 1869,<ref name=\"Veterans Agency\">{{cite web|url=http://www.veterans-uk.info/remembrance/ware.html|title=Major General Sir Fabian Ware|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[Veterans Agency|Ministry of Defence Veterans Agency]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112162637/http://www.veterans-uk.info/remembrance/ware.html|archive-date=12 November 2014|accessdate=7 November 2015}}</ref> to Charles Ware, a chartered accountant, and his wife, Amy Carew, {{Nee}} Goulstone.<ref name= \"ODNB\">{{cite ODNB|title=Ware, Sir Fabian Arthur Goulstone|id=3674|ref=harv|date=2008|first=A.

He became the representative of the Education Committee of the Royal British Commission at the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Exposition Universelle]] of 1900 in [[Paris]]. After the exhibition, Ware worked as an inspector of schools for the [[Board of education|Board of Education]].{{Sfn|Crane|2013|p=17}} He then became a member of a group of young Britons later known as [[Viscount Milner]]'s [[Milner's Kindergarten|kindergarten]]{{Sfn|Stamp|2010|p=72}} and in October 1901 was appointed assistant director of education in the [[Transvaal Colony|Transvaal]].{{Sfn|Worsfold|1913|p=79}} On 5 July 1902, [[Edmund Beale Sargant]], director of education for the Transvaal, wrote a letter to the [[Council of Education, Witwatersrand]], requesting their cooperation in selecting a committee regarding technical education. A committee was then formed, with Ware as the chairman. It recommended the establishment of a technical institute.{{Sfn|Historical Summary|1910|pp=1\u20134}} In late 1902, the report on a technical institute  reached the [[Lieutenant Governor]] of the Transvaal who in January 1903 created a second \"Technical Education Commission\" again with Ware as a member.

The commission represented a joint effort between the British Army and British Red Cross.{{Efn|Crane writes that \"in some ways the GRC remained a curious hybrid, semi-detached sort of unit - the Red Cross continued to supply men and vehicles, while Ware was given the local rank of major... and the army took on the costs of crosses, rations and fuel\" {{Sfn|Crane|2013|p=52}}|name=|group=}}{{Sfn|Crane|2013|pp=50\u201352}} On 22 May, he was made a temporary [[major]] in the British Army.{{Sfn|The London Gazette 21 May 1915}} On 9 September, the promotion was [[antedated]] to 22 February 1915.{{Sfn|The London Gazette 7 September 1915}} \n\nWare's work continued to expand: by May 1915, 4,300 graves had been registered. He was extensively involved in early organization of the commission, dividing it into two main parts and seven sections. That spring he began serving as an intermediary between the French and British governments over grave-related matters. The organization began handling requests at a headquarters in [[Lillers]], and the sections worked on grave maintenance. The organization was soon exempted from a ban on [[War photography|photography]] and a department of three photographers was created to photograph graves; by mid-August, six thousand graves had been photographed and eight hundred photographs sent to families. A further 18,173 graves had been registered. Around the same time Ware became unable to continue work with the Mobile Ambulance Unit, and began to solely focus on the commission. On 6 September Macready recommended transferring the organization completely to the Army; the transfer was completed by late October.{{Sfn|Crane|2013|p=|pp=50\u201352, 54\u201356, 59}}  \n\nIn his role in the commission, wares served as \"the sole [[intermediary]] between the British Army in the Field and the French Military and Civil Authorities in all matters relating to graves.\"{{Sfn|War Graves|1929|p=15}} Throughout 1915 and 1916, Ware led negotiations between France and Britain, resolving various issues, particularly that of [[land expropriation]]. Around June 1915, his efforts resulted in an 'expropriation bill' that began to be debated by the French government. Ware shepherded the bill through its passage, urging prominent figures such as the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]], the [[Adjutant-General to the Forces|Adjutant-General]], the [[King of the United Kingdom|King]], and the editor of the ''Times'' to support it.{{Sfn|Crane|2013|p=|pp=59, 64}} The law passed the French government on 29 December 1917.{{Sfn|Documents of the NYS Assembly|1918|p=548}} It gave Britain the ability to control their war graves in \"perpetuity of [[sepulture]]\"{{Sfn|Miles|2017|p=51}} and provided for the establishment of a British authority to manage the cemeteries.{{Sfn|Crane|2013|p=65}} \n\nWhen [[William Glynne Charles Gladstone]], a [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] and the grandson of former Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone]], was [[killed in action]] near [[Laventie]] on 13 April 1915, his family attempted to have the body [[Exhumation|exhumed]] and returned to England. Despite a ban on exhumations established by [[Joseph Joffre]], his family received special permission to take the body and bury it in [[Hawarden|Hawarden, Wales]].

Humiliated for his illiteracy, his dominating and arrogant non-biological father, Shukla, decides to have Radhe marry an educated girl and chooses \"district-topper\" Krishna from the neighboring town of [[Malihabad]].\n\nIntelligent and ambitious, Krishna assists her father, Dubey, at his medical clinic. Her mother had died of cervical cancer and Krishna dreams of studying medicine in [[London]] and becoming a doctor. Though devastated by the idea of marrying into an illiterate conservative family, Krishna goes ahead with the wedding to save her father's reputation.\n\nImmediately after the wedding, Krishna is humiliated by her mother-in-law, Shuklain, and others in the Shukla family who resent her for her independent thinking and modern views. However, Radhe supports her. Gradually, Krishna returns his affections and is able to bring some positive changes into the Shukla household starting with getting rid of domestic violence in the house. In a twist, it is revealed that Radhe is Lambodar and his late wife Vrinda's son. Lambodar, Shukla's elder brother, had murdered Vrinda when she tried to save Shuklain from Lambodar's unwanted sexual advances. Lambodar is sent to prison and Radhe and Krishna leave for [[London]]. \n\nIn medical school, Krishna is punished by stern, arrogant NRI professor Dr. Veer Sahay, a famous clinical cardiologist, whose native city is [[Unnao]]. Dr. Veer is expelled from his job for racist behaviour. His car hits Radhe who dies in the accident. The Shuklas promptly blame Krishna for his death and mistreat her. An emotionally broken Krishna is forced to stay with the Shuklas who had recently opened a special hospital named the Radhe Krishna Hospital where Krishna must now work.\n\nMeanwhile, Lambodar tries to escape from prison and gets admitted to a hospital. Dr. Veer returns to India where his past is revealed to be connected to the Shuklas. Dr. Veer's father worked for Shukla who refused to lend him money for an important surgery which eventually led to Veer's father's death. Veer harbours a deep grudge against the Shuklas. He and Krishna are forced to run the Radhe Krishna Hospital and slowly fall in love with one another and are married. \n\nVeer buys the Radhe Krishna Hospital at an auction and gifts it to Krishna. Shukla manipulates everyone including Krishna to think that Veer killed Radhe and was faking his love for Krishna. Veer gets ten years imprisonment for Radhe's murder. A heartbroken Krishna returns the hospital to Shukla ji and leaves for London to complete medical school.\n\n===5 years later===\nDr. Krishna Dubey, an honest and sincere professional doctor now works at the Life Care Hospital. Shukla tries to convince her to work in his hospital for his business growth, but she rejects the offer. Veer escapes from prison to meet Krishna and pleads his innocence but is soon captured and sent back to prison. A mysterious man convinces an emotional Shuklain and Gajanan that he is their Radhe. Veer's mother, Sunaina, wants Shukla to bail Veer out as \"Radhe\" has now returned. Veer gets bail and begins investigating the actual identity of the new Radhe. Veer and Krishna discover that the new Radhe is actually Mohan who is defrauding the family.\n\nSoon, the Shuklas realise that they were being duped by Mohan.

Humiliated for his illiteracy, his dominating and arrogant non-biological father, Shukla, decides to have Radhe marry an educated girl and chooses \"district-topper\" Krishna from the neighboring town of [[Malihabad]].\n\nIntelligent and ambitious, Krishna assists her father, Dubey, at his medical clinic. Her mother had died of cervical cancer and Krishna dreams of studying medicine in [[London]] and becoming a doctor. Though devastated by the idea of marrying into an illiterate conservative family, Krishna goes ahead with the wedding to save her father's reputation.\n\nImmediately after the wedding, Krishna is humiliated by her mother-in-law, Shuklain, and others in the Shukla family who resent her for her independent thinking and modern views. However, Radhe supports her. Gradually, Krishna returns his affections and is able to bring some positive changes into the Shukla household starting with getting rid of domestic violence in the house. In a twist, it is revealed that Radhe is Lambodar and his late wife Vrinda's son. Lambodar, Shukla's elder brother, had murdered Vrinda when she tried to save Shuklain from Lambodar's unwanted sexual advances. Lambodar is sent to prison and Radhe and Krishna leave for [[London]]. \n\nIn medical school, Krishna is punished by stern, arrogant NRI professor Dr. Veer Sahay, a famous clinical cardiologist, whose native city is [[Unnao]]. Dr. Veer is expelled from his job for racist behaviour. His car hits Radhe who dies in the accident. The Shuklas promptly blame Krishna for his death and mistreat her. An emotionally broken Krishna is forced to stay with the Shuklas who had recently opened a special hospital named the Radhe Krishna Hospital where Krishna must now work.\n\nMeanwhile, Lambodar tries to escape from prison and gets admitted to a hospital. Dr. Veer returns to India where his past is revealed to be connected to the Shuklas. Dr. Veer's father worked for Shukla who refused to lend him money for an important surgery which eventually led to Veer's father's death. Veer harbours a deep grudge against the Shuklas. He and Krishna are forced to run the Radhe Krishna Hospital and slowly fall in love with one another and are married. \n\nVeer buys the Radhe Krishna Hospital at an auction and gifts it to Krishna. Shukla manipulates everyone including Krishna to think that Veer killed Radhe and was faking his love for Krishna. Veer gets ten years imprisonment for Radhe's murder. A heartbroken Krishna returns the hospital to Shukla ji and leaves for London to complete medical school.\n\n===5 years later===\nDr. Krishna Dubey, an honest and sincere professional doctor now works at the Life Care Hospital. Shukla tries to convince her to work in his hospital for his business growth, but she rejects the offer. Veer escapes from prison to meet Krishna and pleads his innocence but is soon captured and sent back to prison. A mysterious man convinces an emotional Shuklain and Gajanan that he is their Radhe. Veer's mother, Sunaina, wants Shukla to bail Veer out as \"Radhe\" has now returned. Veer gets bail and begins investigating the actual identity of the new Radhe. Veer and Krishna discover that the new Radhe is actually Mohan who is defrauding the family.\n\nSoon, the Shuklas realise that they were being duped by Mohan. They are grateful to Veer and Krishna for exposing him. Veer and Krishna reject an appointment letter from the London Royal Hospital to stay back in Kanpur with the Shukla family who give them their blessings.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n* [[Megha Chakraborty]] as Dr. Krishna Sahay\u2013 [[Clinical]] [[cancer]] [[specialist]]; Kaksh Nath's daughter; Radhe's former wife; Veer's wife\n* Gaurav Sareen as Radhe Shukla\u2013 Lambodar and Vrinda's son; Krishna's former husband\n* Karan Vohra as Dr. Veer Sahay\u2013 Clinical [[cardiology]] specialist; Sunaina's son; Nayani's brother; Krishna's husband\n\n===Recurring===\n{{div col}}\n* Neeraj Sood as Dr. Kaksh Nath Dubey\u2013 Gulkand's brother; Krishna's father\n* [[Sushmita Mukherjee]] as Gulkand Saneria\u2013 Kaksh Nath's sister; Krishna's aunt; Nirmal's wife\n* Pawan Mahendru as Nirmal Saneria\u2013 Gulkand's husband; Krishna's uncle\n* [[Yamini Singh]] as Sunaina Sahay\u2013 Veer and Nayani's mother\n* Bhagwan Tiwari as Gajodhar Shukla\u2013 Lambodar's brother; Raima's husband; Radhe's uncle; Gajanan, Triloki and Jhabbo's father\n* Madhuri Sanjeev as Raima Shukla\u2013 Gajodhar's wife; Radhe's aunt; Gajanan, Triloki and Jhabbo's mother\n* Sunny Sachdeva as Gajanan Shukla\u2013 Gajodhar and Raima's son; Radhe's cousin; Triloki and Jhabbo's brother; Laali's husband\n* Divya Malik as Laali Shukla\u2013 Gajanan's wife\n* Manoj Verma as Triloki Shukla\u2013 Gajodhar and Raima's son; Radhe's cousin; Gajanan and Jhabbo's brother; Bela's husband\n* Bhoomika Mirchandani as Bela Shukla\u2013 Sahira's daughter; Titi's sister; Triloki's wife\n* Piew Jana as Jhabbo Mishra\u2013 Gajodhar and Raima's daughter; Radhe's cousin; Gajanan and Triloki's sister; Matuk's wife\n* Amitabh Singh Ramkshatra as Matuk Nath Mishra\u2013 Jhabbo's husband\n* Abhinandan Jindal as Saajan Srivastav\u2013 Radhe's best friend and confidante; Guddan's husband\n* Kaushiki Rathore as Guddan Srivastav\u2013 Saajan's wife\n* [[Anupam Shyam]] as Lambodar Shukla\u2013 Gajodhar's brother; Vrinda's husband; Radhe's father\n* Meena Mir as Sahira Awasthi\u2013 Bela and Titi's mother\n* Shivanya Ahlawat as Titi Awasthi\u2013 Sahira's daughter; Bela's sister\n* [[Ishaan Singh Manhas]] as Prashant Ahuja\u2013 Krishna\u2019s former boyfriend and mentor\n* [[Ankit Bathla]] as Dr. Aayan Kapoor\u2013 Clinical [[oncology]] specialist\n* Vividha Kirti as Shivani Singh\u2013 Veer's former girlfriend\n* Mayank Arora as Mohan\n* Aaira Rajput as Nayani Sahay\u2013 Sunaina's daughter; Veer's sister\n* Babla Kochhar as Dr. Shrikant Rao\u2013 [[Psychiatrist]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Guests===\n* [[Mouni Roy]] as Sundari (2018)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.hotstar.com/tv/krishna-chali-london/17689 Krishna Chali London] streaming on [[Hotstar]]\n\n{{Star Plus Shows}}\n\n[[Category:2018 Indian television series debuts]]\n[[Category:Hindi-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Indian drama television series]]\n[[Category:Star Plus television series]]\n[[Category:Television shows set in Uttar Pradesh]]\n[[Category:2010s Indian television series]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toClinical(link changed toMedicine) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krishna_Chali_London"}
