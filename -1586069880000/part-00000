It remains the only UK-designed-and-built fighter capable of [[Mach number|Mach 2]].  The Lightning was designed, developed, and manufactured by [[English Electric]], which was later absorbed by the newly-formed [[British Aircraft Corporation]]. Later the type was marketed as the '''BAC Lightning'''.  It was operated by the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF), the [[Kuwait Air Force]] (KAF) and the [[Royal Saudi Air Force]] (RSAF).\n\nA unique feature of the Lightning's design is the vertical, staggered configuration of its two [[Rolls-Royce Avon]] [[turbojet]] engines within the fuselage. The Lightning was initially designed and developed as an interceptor to defend the [[V bomber]] airfields<ref>Note: at the time, the V bombers carried Britain's [[nuclear deterrent]] and thus were the likely first-strike targets of a Soviet air attack on the UK. In addition to the Lightning, last line-of-defence for the airfields was to be what became the [[Bloodhound (missile)|Bristol Bloodhound]] guided missile.</ref> from attack by anticipated future nuclear-armed supersonic Soviet bombers such as what emerged as the [[Tupolev Tu-22]], but it was subsequently also required to intercept other [[bomber]] aircraft such as the [[Tupolev Tu-16]] and the [[Tupolev Tu-95]]. The Lightning has exceptional [[rate of climb]], [[Ceiling (aeronautics)|ceiling]], and speed; pilots have described flying it as \"being saddled to a skyrocket\".<ref name= \"Winchester p. 82\" /> This performance and the initially limited fuel supply<ref>Note: the original specification only called for a 150-mile radius of action from the V bomber bases the aircraft was defending. [[Roland Beamont]] later called for the Lightning's fuel capacity to be greatly increased, which it was.</ref> made the Lightning a \"fuel-critical\" aircraft, meaning that its missions are dictated to a high degree by its limited range. Later developments provided greater range and speed along with [[aerial reconnaissance]] and [[Close air support|ground-attack]] capability.\n\nFollowing retirement by the RAF in the late 1980s, many of the remaining aircraft became museum exhibits. Until 2009, three Lightnings were kept flying at \"[[Thunder City]]\" in [[Cape Town]], South Africa. In September 2008, the [[Institution of Mechanical Engineers]] conferred on the Lightning its \"Engineering Heritage Award\" at a ceremony at [[BAE Systems]]' site at [[Warton Aerodrome]].<ref>Robinson, Ben.

Petter|W.E.W. \"Teddy\" Petter]], formerly chief designer at [[Westland Aircraft]], was a keen early proponent of Britain's need to develop a supersonic fighter aircraft. In 1947, Petter approached the [[Ministry of Supply (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Supply]] (MoS) with his proposal, and in response [[List of Air Ministry Specifications|Specification ER.103]] was issued for a single research aircraft, which was to be capable of flight at {{convert|1.5|Mach|50,000|km/h|0}} and {{convert|50000|ft}}.<ref>Darling 2000, pp. 6\u20137.</ref>\n\nPetter initiated a design proposal with [[Frederick Page|F W \"Freddie\" Page]] leading the design and [[Ray Creasey]] responsible for the aerodynamics.{{sfnp|Davies|2014|p=104}} By July 1948 their proposal incorporated the stacked engine configuration and a high-mounted tailplane but was designed for Mach 1.5. As a consequence it had a conventional 40\u00b0 swept wing {{sfnp|Davies|2014|p=102}} This proposal was submitted in the November {{sfnp|Ransom|1986|p=218}} and in January 1949 the project was designated P.1 by English Electric.{{sfnp|Ransom|1986|p=58}} On 29 March 1949 MoS granted approval for English Electric to start the detailed design, develop wind tunnel models and build a full-size mockup. The design that had developed during 1948 evolved further during 1949.{{sfnp|Ransom|1986|p=219}}{{sfnp|Davies|2014|p=104}} To achieve Mach 2 the wing sweep was increased to 60\u00b0 with the ailerons moved to the wingtips.{{sfnp|Davies|2014|p=103}} In late 1949 low-speed wind tunnel tests showed that a vortex was generated by the wing which caused a large downwash on the tailplane; this issue was solved by lowering its height below the wing.{{sfnp|Davies|2014|p=103}} Following the resignation of Petter, Page took over as design team leader for the P.1.<ref name=\"Darling 2000, pp. 8\u201310\">Darling 2000, pp. 8\u201310.</ref>\n\nIn 1949, the Ministry of Supply had issued Specification F23/49, which expanded upon the scope of ER103 to include fighter-level manoeuvring. On 1 April 1950, English Electric received a contract for two flying [[airframe]]s, as well as one static airframe, designated ''P.1.''<ref name=\"Darling 2000, pp. 8\u201310\" />\n\nThe [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] was sceptical of Petter's swept wing concepts. To test the design of both the wing, the tailplane and to assess handling, [[Short Brothers]] were issued a contract to produce the [[Short SB5]] in mid-1950.<ref group=\"nb\">The SB5 was allocated serial number WG768 on 27 July 1950.</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Air-Britain Aeromilitaria|volume=37|issue=145|title=Post-1950 Aircraft Specifications|author=Phil Butler|publisher=[[Air-Britain]]|pages=24\u201325|issn=0262-8791 }}</ref> This was a low-speed research aircraft and was designed so that different wing sweep angles could be assumed by the single aircraft. An assortment of tailplanes and wings were supplied and could be installed in order for their flight performance to be evaluated. However, following the first flight of the SB.5 on 2 December 1952, the trials demonstrated the choice of a tailplane and a 60-degree wingsweep and proved the design principles to be effective.<ref>Darling 2000, pp. 7\u20138.</ref>\n\n===Prototypes===\n[[File:English Electric P.1 (27898298121).jpg|thumb|P1A]]\nFrom 1953 onwards, the first three prototype aircraft were hand-built at [[Samlesbury]]. These aircraft had been assigned the [[United Kingdom military aircraft serial numbers|aircraft serials]] ''WG760'', ''WG763'', and ''WG765'' (the static airframe){{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}. The prototypes were powered by un-[[Afterburner|reheated]] [[Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire]] turbojets, as the selected [[Rolls-Royce Avon]] engines which powered subsequent production aircraft had fallen behind schedule due to their own development problems.<ref>Darling 2000, p. 10.</ref> Due to the limited internal space of the fuselage the fuel capacity was relatively small, giving the prototypes an extremely limited [[combat endurance|endurance]], and the narrow tyres housed in the thin wings rapidly wore out.<ref name=\"Scott 2000_13\">Scott 2000, p. 13.</ref> Outwardly, the prototypes looked very much like the production series, but they were distinguished by the rounded-triangular intakes, short fins and lack of operational equipment.<ref name= \"Winchester p. 82\" />\n\nOn 9 June 1952, it was decided that there would be a second phase of prototypes built to develop the aircraft towards achieving {{convert|2.0|Mach|km/h|0}}; these were designated ''P.1B'' while the initial three prototypes were retroactively reclassified as ''P.1A''.<ref>Darling 2000, pp. 16\u201317.</ref> P.1B was a significant improvement on P.1A. While it was similar in aerodynamics, structure and control systems, it incorporated extensive alterations to the forward fuselage, reheated Rolls Royce Avon R24R engines, a conical centre body [[inlet cone]], variable nozzle reheat and provision for weapons systems integrated with the [[air data computer|ADC]] and [[Airborne interception radar#AI.23|AI.23 radar]].{{sfnp|Beamont|1984|p=51-52}}<ref name =\"buttler 65\" /> Three P1B prototypes were built, assigned serials XA847, XA853 and XA856<ref name=\"Beamont 123\">Beamont 1985 p.123</ref>\n\nIn May 1954, ''WG760'' and its support equipment were moved to [[RAF Boscombe Down]] for pre-flight ground taxi trials; on the morning of 4 August 1954, ''WG760'', piloted by [[Roland Beamont]], flew for the first time from Boscombe Down.<ref>Darling 2000, pp. 10\u201312.</ref> One week later, ''WG760'' officially achieved [[supersonic]] flight for the first time, having exceeded the [[speed of sound]] during its third flight.<ref name =\"buttler 65\">Buttler 2000, p. 65.</ref> During its first flight, ''WG760'' had unknowingly exceeded {{convert|1|Mach|km/h|0}}, but due to [[position error]] the [[Machmeter|Mach meter]] only showed a maximum of {{convert|0.95|Mach|km/h|0}}. The occurrence was noticed during flight data analysis a few days later.<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1957/1957%20-%200541.html \"Progress with the P.1\"] ''Flight'', 26 April 1957, p.&nbsp;543.</ref> While ''WG760'' had proven the P.1 design to be viable, it was limited to {{convert|1.51|Mach|km/h|0}} due to [[directional stability]] limits. In May 1956, the P.1 received the \"Lightning\" name, which was said to have been partially selected to reflect the aircraft's supersonic capabilities.<ref name =\"buttler 66\">Buttler 2000, p. 66.</ref>\n\nOn 4 April 1957 Beamont made the first flight of the P.1B (XA847) exceeding Mach 1 during this flight.{{sfnp|Flight|26 April 1957}}{{sfnp|Beamont|1985|p=56-57}} On 25 November he reached Mach 2, {{sfnp|Beamont|1985|p=67}} the first time in a British aircraft.<ref name= \"Winchester p. 82\" /> During the early flight trials of the P.1B speeds in excess of 1,000&nbsp;mph were achieved daily. During this period the [[Fairey FD2]] delta held the world speed record (1,132&nbsp;mph achieved on 10 March 1956 and held till December 1957). While the P.1B was potentially faster than the FD2, it lacked the fuel capacity to provide one run in each direction at maximum speed to claim the record in accordance with international rules.{{sfnp|Beamont|1985|p=59}}\n\nIn 1958 two test pilots from the USAF [[Air Force Flight Test Center]], Andy Anderson and [[Deke Slayton]], were given the opportunity to familiarise themselves with the P1B. Slayton, who was subsequently selected as one of the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] astronauts, commented:\n\n{{quote|The P.1 was a terrific plane, with the easy handling of the F-86 and the performance of an F-104. Its only drawback was that it had no range at all. . . Looking back, however, I'd have to say that the P.1 was my favourite all-time plane.<ref>{{cite publication |title=Deke!

To best perform this intercept mission, emphasis was placed on rate-of-climb, acceleration, and speed, rather than [[range (aeronautics)|range]] \u2013 originally a radius of operation of {{convert|150|mi}} from the V bomber airfields was specified \u2013 and [[combat endurance]]. It was equipped with two 30&nbsp;mm ADEN cannon in front of the cockpit windscreen and an interchangeable fuselage weapons pack containing either an additional two ADEN cannon, 48 {{convert|2|in|adj=on|spell=in}} unguided air-to-air rockets, or two [[de Havilland Firestreak]] [[air-to-air missile]]s;<ref name=\"Scott 2000_119\">Scott 2000, pp. 119\u2013129.</ref> a heavy loadout optimised for damaging large aircraft. The [[Ferranti]] [[AI.23]] onboard radar provided [[missile guidance]] and ranging, as well as search and track functions.<ref name= \"Pilot's Notes, F.1\" />\n\nThe next two Lightning variants, the ''Lightning F.1A'' and ''F.2'', were steady but relatively minor refinements of the design; the next variant, the ''Lightning F.3'', was a major departure. The F.3 had higher thrust [[Rolls-Royce Avon]] 301R engines, a larger squared-off fin and strengthened [[inlet cone]] allowing a service clearance to {{convert|2.0|Mach|km/h|0}} (the F.1, F.1A and F.2 were limited to {{convert|1.7|Mach|km/h|0}}).<ref name= \"Pilot's Notes, F.3\">''Pilot's Notes, Lightning F.Mk.3''. Warton Aerodrome, UK: English Electric Technical Services, April 1965.</ref> The A.I.23B radar and [[Red Top missile]] offered a forward hemisphere attack capability and deletion of the nose cannon. The new engines and fin made the F.3 the highest performance Lightning yet, but with an even higher fuel consumption and resulting shorter range. The next variant, the ''Lightning F.6'', was already in development, but there was a need for an interim solution to partially address the F.3's shortcomings, the ''F.3A''.\n\n[[File:English Electric Lightning F3, UK - Air Force AN1127832.jpg|thumb|left|Lightning F.3 in flight, 1983]]\nThe F.3A introduced two improvements: a new, non-jettisonable, {{convert|610|impgal|L|adj=on}} ventral fuel tank,<ref name= \"Pilot's Notes, F.6\">''Pilot's Notes, Lightning F.Mk.6''. Warton Aerodrome, UK: English Electric Technical Services, September 1966.</ref> and a new, kinked, conically cambered wing leading edge, incorporating a slightly larger [[leading edge]] fuel tank, raising the total usable internal fuel by {{convert|716|impgal|L}}. The conically cambered wing improved manoeuvrability, especially at higher altitudes, and the ventral tank nearly doubled available fuel. The increased fuel was welcome, but the lack of cannon armament was felt to be a deficiency. It was thought that cannons were desirable to fire warning shots in the intercept mission.<ref>Williams and Gustin 2004, p. 106.</ref>\n\nThe ''Lightning F.6'' was the ultimate Lightning version to see British service. Originally it was nearly identical to the F.3A with the exception that it could carry two {{convert|260|impgal|L|adj=on}} [[ferry tank]]s on [[Hardpoint|pylons]] over the wings. These tanks were jettisonable in an emergency, and gave the F.6 a substantially improved deployment capability. There remained one glaring shortcoming: the lack of cannon. This was finally rectified in the form of a modified ventral tank with two ADEN cannons mounted in the front. The addition of the cannons and their ammunition decreased the tank's fuel capacity from {{convert|610|to|535|impgal|L}}, but the cannon made the F.6 a \"real fighter\" again.<ref name= \"Pilot's Notes, F.6\" />\n\nThe final British Lightning was the ''Lightning F.2A''. This was an F.2 upgraded with the cambered wing, the squared fin, and the {{convert|610|impgal|L}} ventral tank. The F.2A retained the A.I.23 and Firestreak missile, the nose cannon, and the earlier Avon 211R engines.<ref name= \"Aircrew Manual, F.2A\">''Lightning F.Mk.2A Aircrew Manual''. Warton Aerodrome, UK: English Electric Technical Services, July 1968.</ref> Although the F.2A lacked the thrust of the later Lightnings, it had the longest tactical range of all Lightning variants, and was used for low-altitude interception over [[West Germany]].\n\n===Export and further developments===\nThe ''Lightning F.53'', otherwise known as the ''Export Lightning'', developed as a private venture by BAC. While the Lightning had originated as an interception aircraft, this version was to have a [[Multirole combat aircraft|multirole]] capability for quickly interchanging between interception, reconnaissance, and ground-attack duties.<ref name=\"flight68 p371\">''Flight International'' 5 September 1968, p. 371.</ref> The F.53 was based on the F.6 airframe and avionics, including the large ventral fuel tank, cambered wing and overwing pylons for drop tanks of the F.6, but incorporated an additional pair of hardpoints under the outer wing. These hardpoints could be fitted with pylons for [[air-to-ground weaponry]], including two {{convert|1000|lb|abbr=on}} bombs or four [[SNEB]] rocket pods each carrying 18 68&nbsp;mm rockets. A gun pack carrying two ADEN cannons and 120 rounds each could replace the forward part of the ventral fuel tank.<ref name=\"flight68 p372-3\">''Flight International'' 5 September 1968, pp. 372\u2013373.</ref>{{refn|The ventral cannon installation was designed for the export aircraft but was later adopted by the RAF for the F.6 and F.2A.<ref name=\"WoF7 p57\">Lake 1997, p. 57.</ref>|group=nb}} Alternative, interchangeable packs in the forward fuselage carried two Firestreak missiles, two Red Top missiles, twin retractable launchers for 44\u00d7 {{convert|2|inch|adj=on|sigfig=1}} rockets, or a [[reconnaissance pod]] fitted with five 70&nbsp;mm Type 360 Vinten cameras.<ref name=\"flight68 p373\">''Flight International'' 5 September 1968, p. 373.</ref>\n\nBAC also proposed clearing the overwing hardpoints for carriage of weapons as well as [[drop tank]]s, with additional Matra JL-100 combined rocket and fuel pods (each containing 18 SNEB {{convert|68|mm|abbr=on|lk=on}} rockets and {{convert|227|L|impgal|lk=on|order=flip}} of fuel) or {{convert|1000|lb}} bombs being possible options. This could give a maximum ground attack weapons load for a developed export Lightning of six {{convert|1000|lb}} bombs or 44 \u00d7 {{convert|2|in|adj=on|abbr=on}} rockets and 144 \u00d7 68&nbsp;mm rockets.<ref name=\"combatp67\">Gunston and Spick 1983, p. 67.</ref><ref name=\"flight68 p372-3,6\">''Flight International'' 5 September 1968, pp. 372\u2013373, 376.</ref> The ''Lightning T.55'' was the export two-seat variant; unlike the RAF two-seaters, the T.55 was equipped for combat duties. The T.55 had a very similar fuselage to the T.5, while also using the wing and large ventral tank of the F.6.<ref name=\"WoF7 p56-7\" /> The Export Lightning had all of the capability of the RAF's own Lightnings such as exceptional climb rate and agile manoeuvering. The Export Lightning also retained the difficulty of maintenance, and serviceability rates suffered. The F.53 was generally well regarded by its pilots, and its adaptation to multiple roles showed the skill of its designers.<ref name= \"McLelland 2009\">McLelland 2009, {{page needed|date=April 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1963, BAC Warton was working on the preliminary design of a two-seat Lightning development with a [[variable-geometry wing]], based on the Lightning T.5. In addition to the [[variable-sweep wing]], which was to sweepback between 25 degrees and 60 degrees, the proposed design featured an extended ventral pack for greater fuel capacity, an enlarged dorsal fin fairing, an arrestor hook, and a revised inward-retracting undercarriage. The aircraft was designed to be compatible with the [[Royal Navy]]'s existing [[aircraft carriers]] [[carrier-based aircraft]], the VG Lightning concept was revised into a land-based interceptor intended for the RAF the following year.<ref name= \"Wood 1986\">Wood 1986, pp. 183\u2013184.</ref> Various alternative engines to the Avon were suggested, such as the newer [[Rolls-Royce Spey]] engine. It is likely that the VG Lightning would have adopted a solid nose (by moving the air inlet to the sides or to upper fuselage) to install a larger, more capable radar.<ref name =\"buttler 114-117\" />\n\n==Design==\n\n===Overview===\nThe Lightning had several distinctive design features, the primary being the twin-engine arrangement, notched [[delta wing]], and low-mounted tailplane. The vertically stacked and longitudinally staggered engines were the solution devised by Petter to meet the conflicting requirements of minimising frontal area, providing undisturbed engine airflow across a wide speed range, and packaging two engines to provide sufficient thrust to meet performance goals. The unusual over/under configuration allowed for the thrust of two engines, with the [[Aerodynamic drag|drag]] equivalent to only 1.5 engines mounted side-by-side, a reduction in drag of 25% over more conventional twin-engine installations.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1968/1968%20-%201766.html |title=Multi-mission Lightning |work=Flight International |page=372 |date=5 September 1960}}</ref> The engines were fed by a single nose inlet (with [[inlet cone]]), with the flow split vertically aft of the cockpit, and the nozzles tightly stacked, effectively tucking one engine behind the cockpit. The result was a low frontal area, an efficient inlet, and excellent single-engine handling with no problems of asymmetrical thrust. Because the engines were close together, an uncontained failure of one engine was likely to damage the other.

The inlet's central shock cone served as a compression surface, diverting air into the annular inlet. As the Lightning accelerated through Mach 1, the shock cone generated an oblique shock positioned forward of the intake lip. Known as a subcritical inlet condition, this was stable, but produced inefficient spillage drag. Around the Design Mach speed, the oblique shock was positioned just forward of the inlet lip and efficiently compressed the air without spillage. When travelling beyond the Design Mach, the oblique shock became supercritical, and supersonic airflow entered the inlet duct, which could only handle subsonic air. In this condition, the engine generated drastically less thrust and may result in [[engine surge|surge]]s or [[compressor stall]]s, these could cause [[flameout]]s or damage.\n\nThermal and structural limits were also present. Air is heated considerably when compressed by the passage of an aircraft at supersonic speeds. The airframe absorbs heat from the surrounding air, the inlet shock cone at the front of the aircraft becoming the hottest part. The shock cone was composed of fibreglass, necessary because the shock cone also served as a radar radome; a metal shock cone would have interfered with the AI 23's radar emissions. The shock cone was eventually weakened due to the fatigue caused by the thermal cycles involved in regularly performing high-speed flights. At {{convert|36000|ft}} and {{convert|1.7|Mach|36000|km/h|0}}, the heating conditions on the shock cone was similar to those at sea level and {{convert|650|kn|km/h}} indicated airspeed,<ref group=\"nb\">On a standard day, the temperature of the air at the tip of the shock cone (stagnation temperature) was {{convert|156|\u00b0F}} at {{convert|1.7|Mach|36000|km/h|0}} and {{convert|36000|ft}}.

Prior testing had determined that the aircraft had the excess thrust to achieve this speed, given the right atmospheric conditions of a high tropopause and lower-than-standard temperature. The test flight was to check for inlet stability and monitor temperatures at higher Mach. The aircraft was equipped with a temperature probe to monitor the stagnation temperature, up to a never-exceed temperature of 115&nbsp;\u00b0C.

It remains the only UK-designed-and-built fighter capable of [[Mach number|Mach 2]].  The Lightning was designed, developed, and manufactured by [[English Electric]], which was later absorbed by the newly-formed [[British Aircraft Corporation]]. Later the type was marketed as the '''BAC Lightning'''.  It was operated by the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF), the [[Kuwait Air Force]] (KAF) and the [[Royal Saudi Air Force]] (RSAF).\n\nA unique feature of the Lightning's design is the vertical, staggered configuration of its two [[Rolls-Royce Avon]] [[turbojet]] engines within the fuselage. The Lightning was initially designed and developed as an interceptor to defend the [[V bomber]] airfields<ref>Note: at the time, the V bombers carried Britain's [[nuclear deterrent]] and thus were the likely first-strike targets of a Soviet air attack on the UK. In addition to the Lightning, last line-of-defence for the airfields was to be what became the [[Bloodhound (missile)|Bristol Bloodhound]] guided missile.</ref> from attack by anticipated future nuclear-armed supersonic Soviet bombers such as what emerged as the [[Tupolev Tu-22]], but it was subsequently also required to intercept other [[bomber]] aircraft such as the [[Tupolev Tu-16]] and the [[Tupolev Tu-95]]. The Lightning has exceptional [[rate of climb]], [[Ceiling (aeronautics)|ceiling]], and speed; pilots have described flying it as \"being saddled to a skyrocket\".<ref name= \"Winchester p. 82\" /> This performance and the initially limited fuel supply<ref>Note: the original specification only called for a 150-mile radius of action from the V bomber bases the aircraft was defending. [[Roland Beamont]] later called for the Lightning's fuel capacity to be greatly increased, which it was.</ref> made the Lightning a \"fuel-critical\" aircraft, meaning that its missions are dictated to a high degree by its limited range. Later developments provided greater range and speed along with [[aerial reconnaissance]] and [[Close air support|ground-attack]] capability.\n\nFollowing retirement by the RAF in the late 1980s, many of the remaining aircraft became museum exhibits. Until 2009, three Lightnings were kept flying at \"[[Thunder City]]\" in [[Cape Town]], South Africa. In September 2008, the [[Institution of Mechanical Engineers]] conferred on the Lightning its \"Engineering Heritage Award\" at a ceremony at [[BAE Systems]]' site at [[Warton Aerodrome]].<ref>Robinson, Ben.

Petter|W.E.W. \"Teddy\" Petter]], formerly chief designer at [[Westland Aircraft]], was a keen early proponent of Britain's need to develop a supersonic fighter aircraft. In 1947, Petter approached the [[Ministry of Supply (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Supply]] (MoS) with his proposal, and in response [[List of Air Ministry Specifications|Specification ER.103]] was issued for a single research aircraft, which was to be capable of flight at {{convert|1.5|Mach|50,000|km/h|0}} and {{convert|50000|ft}}.<ref>Darling 2000, pp. 6\u20137.</ref>\n\nPetter initiated a design proposal with [[Frederick Page|F W \"Freddie\" Page]] leading the design and [[Ray Creasey]] responsible for the aerodynamics.{{sfnp|Davies|2014|p=104}} By July 1948 their proposal incorporated the stacked engine configuration and a high-mounted tailplane but was designed for Mach 1.5. As a consequence it had a conventional 40\u00b0 swept wing {{sfnp|Davies|2014|p=102}} This proposal was submitted in the November {{sfnp|Ransom|1986|p=218}} and in January 1949 the project was designated P.1 by English Electric.{{sfnp|Ransom|1986|p=58}} On 29 March 1949 MoS granted approval for English Electric to start the detailed design, develop wind tunnel models and build a full-size mockup. The design that had developed during 1948 evolved further during 1949.{{sfnp|Ransom|1986|p=219}}{{sfnp|Davies|2014|p=104}} To achieve Mach 2 the wing sweep was increased to 60\u00b0 with the ailerons moved to the wingtips.{{sfnp|Davies|2014|p=103}} In late 1949 low-speed wind tunnel tests showed that a vortex was generated by the wing which caused a large downwash on the tailplane; this issue was solved by lowering its height below the wing.{{sfnp|Davies|2014|p=103}} Following the resignation of Petter, Page took over as design team leader for the P.1.<ref name=\"Darling 2000, pp. 8\u201310\">Darling 2000, pp. 8\u201310.</ref>\n\nIn 1949, the Ministry of Supply had issued Specification F23/49, which expanded upon the scope of ER103 to include fighter-level manoeuvring. On 1 April 1950, English Electric received a contract for two flying [[airframe]]s, as well as one static airframe, designated ''P.1.''<ref name=\"Darling 2000, pp. 8\u201310\" />\n\nThe [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] was sceptical of Petter's swept wing concepts. To test the design of both the wing, the tailplane and to assess handling, [[Short Brothers]] were issued a contract to produce the [[Short SB5]] in mid-1950.<ref group=\"nb\">The SB5 was allocated serial number WG768 on 27 July 1950.</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Air-Britain Aeromilitaria|volume=37|issue=145|title=Post-1950 Aircraft Specifications|author=Phil Butler|publisher=[[Air-Britain]]|pages=24\u201325|issn=0262-8791 }}</ref> This was a low-speed research aircraft and was designed so that different wing sweep angles could be assumed by the single aircraft. An assortment of tailplanes and wings were supplied and could be installed in order for their flight performance to be evaluated. However, following the first flight of the SB.5 on 2 December 1952, the trials demonstrated the choice of a tailplane and a 60-degree wingsweep and proved the design principles to be effective.<ref>Darling 2000, pp. 7\u20138.</ref>\n\n===Prototypes===\n[[File:English Electric P.1 (27898298121).jpg|thumb|P1A]]\nFrom 1953 onwards, the first three prototype aircraft were hand-built at [[Samlesbury]]. These aircraft had been assigned the [[United Kingdom military aircraft serial numbers|aircraft serials]] ''WG760'', ''WG763'', and ''WG765'' (the static airframe){{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}. The prototypes were powered by un-[[Afterburner|reheated]] [[Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire]] turbojets, as the selected [[Rolls-Royce Avon]] engines which powered subsequent production aircraft had fallen behind schedule due to their own development problems.<ref>Darling 2000, p. 10.</ref> Due to the limited internal space of the fuselage the fuel capacity was relatively small, giving the prototypes an extremely limited [[combat endurance|endurance]], and the narrow tyres housed in the thin wings rapidly wore out.<ref name=\"Scott 2000_13\">Scott 2000, p. 13.</ref> Outwardly, the prototypes looked very much like the production series, but they were distinguished by the rounded-triangular intakes, short fins and lack of operational equipment.<ref name= \"Winchester p. 82\" />\n\nOn 9 June 1952, it was decided that there would be a second phase of prototypes built to develop the aircraft towards achieving {{convert|2.0|Mach|km/h|0}}; these were designated ''P.1B'' while the initial three prototypes were retroactively reclassified as ''P.1A''.<ref>Darling 2000, pp. 16\u201317.</ref> P.1B was a significant improvement on P.1A. While it was similar in aerodynamics, structure and control systems, it incorporated extensive alterations to the forward fuselage, reheated Rolls Royce Avon R24R engines, a conical centre body [[inlet cone]], variable nozzle reheat and provision for weapons systems integrated with the [[air data computer|ADC]] and [[Airborne interception radar#AI.23|AI.23 radar]].{{sfnp|Beamont|1984|p=51-52}}<ref name =\"buttler 65\" /> Three P1B prototypes were built, assigned serials XA847, XA853 and XA856<ref name=\"Beamont 123\">Beamont 1985 p.123</ref>\n\nIn May 1954, ''WG760'' and its support equipment were moved to [[RAF Boscombe Down]] for pre-flight ground taxi trials; on the morning of 4 August 1954, ''WG760'', piloted by [[Roland Beamont]], flew for the first time from Boscombe Down.<ref>Darling 2000, pp. 10\u201312.</ref> One week later, ''WG760'' officially achieved [[supersonic]] flight for the first time, having exceeded the [[speed of sound]] during its third flight.<ref name =\"buttler 65\">Buttler 2000, p. 65.</ref> During its first flight, ''WG760'' had unknowingly exceeded {{convert|1|Mach|km/h|0}}, but due to [[position error]] the [[Machmeter|Mach meter]] only showed a maximum of {{convert|0.95|Mach|km/h|0}}. The occurrence was noticed during flight data analysis a few days later.<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1957/1957%20-%200541.html \"Progress with the P.1\"] ''Flight'', 26 April 1957, p.&nbsp;543.</ref> While ''WG760'' had proven the P.1 design to be viable, it was limited to {{convert|1.51|Mach|km/h|0}} due to [[directional stability]] limits. In May 1956, the P.1 received the \"Lightning\" name, which was said to have been partially selected to reflect the aircraft's supersonic capabilities.<ref name =\"buttler 66\">Buttler 2000, p. 66.</ref>\n\nOn 4 April 1957 Beamont made the first flight of the P.1B (XA847) exceeding Mach 1 during this flight.{{sfnp|Flight|26 April 1957}}{{sfnp|Beamont|1985|p=56-57}} On 25 November he reached Mach 2, {{sfnp|Beamont|1985|p=67}} the first time in a British aircraft.<ref name= \"Winchester p. 82\" /> During the early flight trials of the P.1B speeds in excess of 1,000&nbsp;mph were achieved daily. During this period the [[Fairey FD2]] delta held the world speed record (1,132&nbsp;mph achieved on 10 March 1956 and held till December 1957). While the P.1B was potentially faster than the FD2, it lacked the fuel capacity to provide one run in each direction at maximum speed to claim the record in accordance with international rules.{{sfnp|Beamont|1985|p=59}}\n\nIn 1958 two test pilots from the USAF [[Air Force Flight Test Center]], Andy Anderson and [[Deke Slayton]], were given the opportunity to familiarise themselves with the P1B. Slayton, who was subsequently selected as one of the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] astronauts, commented:\n\n{{quote|The P.1 was a terrific plane, with the easy handling of the F-86 and the performance of an F-104. Its only drawback was that it had no range at all. . . Looking back, however, I'd have to say that the P.1 was my favourite all-time plane.<ref>{{cite publication |title=Deke! U.S. Manned Space: From Mercury to the Shuttle |author=Slayton D.K. with Cassutt M.|publisher=Forge Books |isbn=978-0-3128-5918-3 |year=1995 }}</ref>}}\n\n===Production===\nThe first operational Lightning, [[British military aircraft designation systems|designated]] ''Lightning F.1'', was designed as an interceptor to defend the [[V bomber|V Force]] airfields in conjunction with the V Force airfield's own \"last ditch\" [[Bloodhound (missile)|Bristol Bloodhound]] missile defences from enemy nuclear-armed bomber attack long enough for the also [[Yellow Sun (nuclear weapon)|nuclear-armed]] V Force bombers to [[Scrambling (military)|take-off]] and get clear of their airfields which, along with the [[List of V Bomber dispersal bases|dispersal airfields]], would be the highest priority targets in the UK for enemy nuclear weapons. To best perform this intercept mission, emphasis was placed on rate-of-climb, acceleration, and speed, rather than [[range (aeronautics)|range]] \u2013 originally a radius of operation of {{convert|150|mi}} from the V bomber airfields was specified \u2013 and [[combat endurance]]. It was equipped with two 30&nbsp;mm ADEN cannon in front of the cockpit windscreen and an interchangeable fuselage weapons pack containing either an additional two ADEN cannon, 48 {{convert|2|in|adj=on|spell=in}} unguided air-to-air rockets, or two [[de Havilland Firestreak]] [[air-to-air missile]]s;<ref name=\"Scott 2000_119\">Scott 2000, pp. 119\u2013129.</ref> a heavy loadout optimised for damaging large aircraft. The [[Ferranti]] [[AI.23]] onboard radar provided [[missile guidance]] and ranging, as well as search and track functions.<ref name= \"Pilot's Notes, F.1\" />\n\nThe next two Lightning variants, the ''Lightning F.1A'' and ''F.2'', were steady but relatively minor refinements of the design; the next variant, the ''Lightning F.3'', was a major departure. The F.3 had higher thrust [[Rolls-Royce Avon]] 301R engines, a larger squared-off fin and strengthened [[inlet cone]] allowing a service clearance to {{convert|2.0|Mach|km/h|0}} (the F.1, F.1A and F.2 were limited to {{convert|1.7|Mach|km/h|0}}).<ref name= \"Pilot's Notes, F.3\">''Pilot's Notes, Lightning F.Mk.3''. Warton Aerodrome, UK: English Electric Technical Services, April 1965.</ref> The A.I.23B radar and [[Red Top missile]] offered a forward hemisphere attack capability and deletion of the nose cannon. The new engines and fin made the F.3 the highest performance Lightning yet, but with an even higher fuel consumption and resulting shorter range. The next variant, the ''Lightning F.6'', was already in development, but there was a need for an interim solution to partially address the F.3's shortcomings, the ''F.3A''.\n\n[[File:English Electric Lightning F3, UK - Air Force AN1127832.jpg|thumb|left|Lightning F.3 in flight, 1983]]\nThe F.3A introduced two improvements: a new, non-jettisonable, {{convert|610|impgal|L|adj=on}} ventral fuel tank,<ref name= \"Pilot's Notes, F.6\">''Pilot's Notes, Lightning F.Mk.6''. Warton Aerodrome, UK: English Electric Technical Services, September 1966.</ref> and a new, kinked, conically cambered wing leading edge, incorporating a slightly larger [[leading edge]] fuel tank, raising the total usable internal fuel by {{convert|716|impgal|L}}. The conically cambered wing improved manoeuvrability, especially at higher altitudes, and the ventral tank nearly doubled available fuel. The increased fuel was welcome, but the lack of cannon armament was felt to be a deficiency. It was thought that cannons were desirable to fire warning shots in the intercept mission.<ref>Williams and Gustin 2004, p. 106.</ref>\n\nThe ''Lightning F.6'' was the ultimate Lightning version to see British service. Originally it was nearly identical to the F.3A with the exception that it could carry two {{convert|260|impgal|L|adj=on}} [[ferry tank]]s on [[Hardpoint|pylons]] over the wings. These tanks were jettisonable in an emergency, and gave the F.6 a substantially improved deployment capability. There remained one glaring shortcoming: the lack of cannon. This was finally rectified in the form of a modified ventral tank with two ADEN cannons mounted in the front. The addition of the cannons and their ammunition decreased the tank's fuel capacity from {{convert|610|to|535|impgal|L}}, but the cannon made the F.6 a \"real fighter\" again.<ref name= \"Pilot's Notes, F.6\" />\n\nThe final British Lightning was the ''Lightning F.2A''. This was an F.2 upgraded with the cambered wing, the squared fin, and the {{convert|610|impgal|L}} ventral tank. The F.2A retained the A.I.23 and Firestreak missile, the nose cannon, and the earlier Avon 211R engines.<ref name= \"Aircrew Manual, F.2A\">''Lightning F.Mk.2A Aircrew Manual''. Warton Aerodrome, UK: English Electric Technical Services, July 1968.</ref> Although the F.2A lacked the thrust of the later Lightnings, it had the longest tactical range of all Lightning variants, and was used for low-altitude interception over [[West Germany]].\n\n===Export and further developments===\nThe ''Lightning F.53'', otherwise known as the ''Export Lightning'', developed as a private venture by BAC. While the Lightning had originated as an interception aircraft, this version was to have a [[Multirole combat aircraft|multirole]] capability for quickly interchanging between interception, reconnaissance, and ground-attack duties.<ref name=\"flight68 p371\">''Flight International'' 5 September 1968, p. 371.</ref> The F.53 was based on the F.6 airframe and avionics, including the large ventral fuel tank, cambered wing and overwing pylons for drop tanks of the F.6, but incorporated an additional pair of hardpoints under the outer wing. These hardpoints could be fitted with pylons for [[air-to-ground weaponry]], including two {{convert|1000|lb|abbr=on}} bombs or four [[SNEB]] rocket pods each carrying 18 68&nbsp;mm rockets. A gun pack carrying two ADEN cannons and 120 rounds each could replace the forward part of the ventral fuel tank.<ref name=\"flight68 p372-3\">''Flight International'' 5 September 1968, pp. 372\u2013373.</ref>{{refn|The ventral cannon installation was designed for the export aircraft but was later adopted by the RAF for the F.6 and F.2A.<ref name=\"WoF7 p57\">Lake 1997, p. 57.</ref>|group=nb}} Alternative, interchangeable packs in the forward fuselage carried two Firestreak missiles, two Red Top missiles, twin retractable launchers for 44\u00d7 {{convert|2|inch|adj=on|sigfig=1}} rockets, or a [[reconnaissance pod]] fitted with five 70&nbsp;mm Type 360 Vinten cameras.<ref name=\"flight68 p373\">''Flight International'' 5 September 1968, p. 373.</ref>\n\nBAC also proposed clearing the overwing hardpoints for carriage of weapons as well as [[drop tank]]s, with additional Matra JL-100 combined rocket and fuel pods (each containing 18 SNEB {{convert|68|mm|abbr=on|lk=on}} rockets and {{convert|227|L|impgal|lk=on|order=flip}} of fuel) or {{convert|1000|lb}} bombs being possible options. This could give a maximum ground attack weapons load for a developed export Lightning of six {{convert|1000|lb}} bombs or 44 \u00d7 {{convert|2|in|adj=on|abbr=on}} rockets and 144 \u00d7 68&nbsp;mm rockets.<ref name=\"combatp67\">Gunston and Spick 1983, p. 67.</ref><ref name=\"flight68 p372-3,6\">''Flight International'' 5 September 1968, pp. 372\u2013373, 376.</ref> The ''Lightning T.55'' was the export two-seat variant; unlike the RAF two-seaters, the T.55 was equipped for combat duties. The T.55 had a very similar fuselage to the T.5, while also using the wing and large ventral tank of the F.6.<ref name=\"WoF7 p56-7\" /> The Export Lightning had all of the capability of the RAF's own Lightnings such as exceptional climb rate and agile manoeuvering. The Export Lightning also retained the difficulty of maintenance, and serviceability rates suffered. The F.53 was generally well regarded by its pilots, and its adaptation to multiple roles showed the skill of its designers.<ref name= \"McLelland 2009\">McLelland 2009, {{page needed|date=April 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1963, BAC Warton was working on the preliminary design of a two-seat Lightning development with a [[variable-geometry wing]], based on the Lightning T.5. In addition to the [[variable-sweep wing]], which was to sweepback between 25 degrees and 60 degrees, the proposed design featured an extended ventral pack for greater fuel capacity, an enlarged dorsal fin fairing, an arrestor hook, and a revised inward-retracting undercarriage. The aircraft was designed to be compatible with the [[Royal Navy]]'s existing [[aircraft carriers]] [[carrier-based aircraft]], the VG Lightning concept was revised into a land-based interceptor intended for the RAF the following year.<ref name= \"Wood 1986\">Wood 1986, pp. 183\u2013184.</ref> Various alternative engines to the Avon were suggested, such as the newer [[Rolls-Royce Spey]] engine.

The vertically stacked and longitudinally staggered engines were the solution devised by Petter to meet the conflicting requirements of minimising frontal area, providing undisturbed engine airflow across a wide speed range, and packaging two engines to provide sufficient thrust to meet performance goals. The unusual over/under configuration allowed for the thrust of two engines, with the [[Aerodynamic drag|drag]] equivalent to only 1.5 engines mounted side-by-side, a reduction in drag of 25% over more conventional twin-engine installations.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1968/1968%20-%201766.html |title=Multi-mission Lightning |work=Flight International |page=372 |date=5 September 1960}}</ref> The engines were fed by a single nose inlet (with [[inlet cone]]), with the flow split vertically aft of the cockpit, and the nozzles tightly stacked, effectively tucking one engine behind the cockpit. The result was a low frontal area, an efficient inlet, and excellent single-engine handling with no problems of asymmetrical thrust. Because the engines were close together, an uncontained failure of one engine was likely to damage the other. If desired, an engine could be shut down in flight and the remaining engine run at a more efficient power setting which increased range or endurance;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1957/1957%20-%200542.html|title=air marshal \u2013 wg \u2013 ib \u2013 1957 \u2013 0542 \u2013 Flight Archive}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1968/1968%20-%201770.html|title=1968 \u2013 1770 \u2013 Flight Archive}}</ref> although this was rarely done operationally because there would be no hydraulic power if the remaining engine failed .<ref name=\"flightglobal.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1961/1961%20-%200231.html|title=lightning \u2013 english electric \u2013 1961 \u2013 0231 \u2013 Flight Archive}}</ref>\n\n[[File:EE Lightning F6 XS904 BQ (7173122840).jpg|thumb|left|Lightning F.6 XS904 after a high-speed taxi run at 2012 Cold War Jets Day, Bruntingthorpe]]\n\nProduction aircraft were powered by various models of the [[Rolls-Royce Avon]] engine.

The inlet's central shock cone served as a compression surface, diverting air into the annular inlet. As the Lightning accelerated through Mach 1, the shock cone generated an oblique shock positioned forward of the intake lip. Known as a subcritical inlet condition, this was stable, but produced inefficient spillage drag. Around the Design Mach speed, the oblique shock was positioned just forward of the inlet lip and efficiently compressed the air without spillage. When travelling beyond the Design Mach, the oblique shock became supercritical, and supersonic airflow entered the inlet duct, which could only handle subsonic air. In this condition, the engine generated drastically less thrust and may result in [[engine surge|surge]]s or [[compressor stall]]s, these could cause [[flameout]]s or damage.\n\nThermal and structural limits were also present. Air is heated considerably when compressed by the passage of an aircraft at supersonic speeds. The airframe absorbs heat from the surrounding air, the inlet shock cone at the front of the aircraft becoming the hottest part. The shock cone was composed of fibreglass, necessary because the shock cone also served as a radar radome; a metal shock cone would have interfered with the AI 23's radar emissions. The shock cone was eventually weakened due to the fatigue caused by the thermal cycles involved in regularly performing high-speed flights. At {{convert|36000|ft}} and {{convert|1.7|Mach|36000|km/h|0}}, the heating conditions on the shock cone was similar to those at sea level and {{convert|650|kn|km/h}} indicated airspeed,<ref group=\"nb\">On a standard day, the temperature of the air at the tip of the shock cone (stagnation temperature) was {{convert|156|\u00b0F}} at {{convert|1.7|Mach|36000|km/h|0}} and {{convert|36000|ft}}.

Prior testing had determined that the aircraft had the excess thrust to achieve this speed, given the right atmospheric conditions of a high tropopause and lower-than-standard temperature. The test flight was to check for inlet stability and monitor temperatures at higher Mach. The aircraft was equipped with a temperature probe to monitor the stagnation temperature, up to a never-exceed temperature of 115&nbsp;\u00b0C.

Even when the Lightning was not grounded by technical faults, the RAF initially struggled to get more than 20 flying hours per aircraft per month compared with the 40 flying hours that English Electric believed could be achieved with proper support.<ref name=\"AIJan06 p64\" /><ref name=\"WoF7 p44-5\">Lake 1997, pp. 44\u201345.</ref> In spite of these concerns, within six months of the Lightning entering service, 74 Squadron was able to achieve 100 flying hours per aircraft.<ref>Darling 2008, p. 55.</ref>\n\nIn addition to its training and operational roles, 74 Squadron was appointed as the official Fighter Command aerobatic team for 1961, flying at air shows throughout the United Kingdom and Europe.<ref name=\"WoF7 p45,95-6\">Lake 1997, pp. 45, 95\u201396.</ref> Deliveries of the slightly improved Lightning F.1A, with improved avionics and provision for an air-to-air refuelling probe, allowed two more squadrons, [[No. 56 Squadron RAF|56]] and [[No. 111 Squadron RAF|111 Squadron]], both based at [[RAF Wattisham]] to convert to the Lightning in 1960\u20131961.<ref name=\"AIJan06 p64\" /> The Lightning F.1 would only be ordered in limited numbers and serve for a short time; nonetheless, it was viewed as a significant step forwards in Britain's air defence capabilities.

It runs for about {{convert|138|mi|km}} north\u2013south in northeast Wisconsin from [[Sheboygan, Wisconsin|Sheboygan]] to the ferry dock in [[Northport, Door County, Wisconsin|Northport]]. Much of the highway is part of the [[Lake Michigan Circle Tour]] from the eastern junction with [[U.S. Route 10 in Wisconsin|U.S. Highway 10]] (US&nbsp;10) in [[Manitowoc, Wisconsin|Manitowoc]] to its junction with [[Wisconsin Highway 57|WIS&nbsp;57]] in [[Sister Bay, Wisconsin|Sister Bay]]. WIS 42 parallels I-43 from [[Sheboygan, Wisconsin|Sheboygan]] to Manitowoc, and parallels WIS 57 throughout much of the route, particularly from Manitowoc to [[Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin|Sturgeon Bay]], meeting the northern terminus of WIS 57 in Sister Bay.\n\n==Route description==\n\n===Sheboygan and Kewaunee counties===\n[[File:WI 23-WI 28-WI 42 Terminus.jpg|thumb|left|The three-highway terminus in Sheboygan featuring WIS&nbsp;42 going northward]]\nWIS&nbsp;42 begins at the intersection of North 14th Street and Erie Avenue (also known as Kohler Memorial Drive) in downtown [[Sheboygan, Wisconsin|Sheboygan]], a block north of the bridge crossing the [[Sheboygan River]]. The intersection is the terminus of two other state highways, [[Wisconsin Highway 23|WIS&nbsp;23]] and [[Wisconsin Highway 28|WIS&nbsp;28]].\n\nWIS&nbsp;42 follows North 14th Street to Calumet Drive, which heads out of the city in a northwesterly direction to its interchange with [[Interstate 43]] (I-43) at exit&nbsp;128 which has four [[roundabout]]s within a mile; two controlling freeway access, a retail development with [[Walmart]] and [[Menards]] at Vanguard Drive, and then CTH-Y. The route continues to the northwest into the city of [[Howards Grove, Wisconsin|Howards Grove]] past [[Howards Grove High School]], where it becomes Madison Avenue. Because there are only two exits in the {{convert|20|mi|km}} between WIS&nbsp;42's junctions with I-43 in Sheboygan and Manitowoc, it also serves as the state-designated Alternate I-43 (along with the roads from those two exits from WIS&nbsp;42) when road incidents close I-43 proper.\n\nAt the intersection of Madison Avenue and South Wisconsin Drive, WIS&nbsp;42 and [[Wisconsin Highway 32|WIS&nbsp;32]] meet. WIS&nbsp;32 continues to the northwest on Madison Avenue, while WIS&nbsp;42 turns north on Wisconsin Drive. WIS&nbsp;42 continues north out of Howards Grove into [[Manitowoc County, Wisconsin|Manitowoc County]]. While in southern Manitowoc County, WIS 42 intersects County Trunk Highway XX (CTH-XX), which leads east to I-43 and Cleveland, carrying it for about a mile before CTH-XX heads west towards Kiel in the community of [[Meeme (community), Wisconsin|Meeme]]. It intersects with CTH-C in the town of Newton, also leading east to I-43 while west towards St. Nazianz.\n\nWIS&nbsp;42 continues to the north towards the city of [[Manitowoc, Wisconsin|Manitowoc]], where it intersects [[U.S. Route 151|US&nbsp;151]] (Calumet Avenue) just west of I-43. Turning east, WIS&nbsp;42 [[concurrency (road)|runs concurrently]] with US&nbsp;151 for about a quarter mile (0.4&nbsp;km) before turning onto I-43 at exit&nbsp;149. WIS&nbsp;42 formerly ran east beyond the interchange with I-43 to South Rapids Road, following the road to the north to Waldo Boulevard and [[U.S. Route 10 in Wisconsin|US&nbsp;10]] on the north side of [[Manitowoc, Wisconsin|Manitowoc]]. WIS&nbsp;42 now runs north on I-43 to its interchange with CTH-JJ (exit&nbsp;152).\n\nWIS&nbsp;42 and US&nbsp;10 follow Waldo Boulevard to the shore of [[Lake Michigan]], running northeast along the shoreline on Memorial Drive out of the city and into [[Two Rivers, Wisconsin|Two Rivers]].\n\nCrossing the [[West Twin River (Wisconsin)|West Twin River]] near its confluence with the [[East Twin River (Wisconsin)|East Twin River]] just south of downtown Two Rivers, WIS&nbsp;42 becomes Washington Street. Two blocks north, it meets the eastern terminus of [[Wisconsin Highway 310|WIS&nbsp;310]] at 16th Street. Six blocks north, it meets the eastern terminus of [[Wisconsin Highway 147|WIS&nbsp;147]] at 22nd Street.\n\nWIS&nbsp;42 turns to the east on 22nd Street and crosses over the East Twin River, then turns north on Lincoln Avenue. WIS&nbsp;42 and WIS&nbsp;147 are the only two state highways that cross both branches of the Twin Rivers, though WIS&nbsp;147 does not cross the [[West Twin River (Wisconsin)|West Twin River]] until about a mile east of its terminus with I-43 near [[Maribel, Wisconsin|Maribel]].\n\nWIS&nbsp;42 continues to the north, running roughly parallel to the Lake Michigan shoreline into [[Kewaunee County, Wisconsin|Kewaunee County]]. Just south of the city of [[Kewaunee, Wisconsin|Kewaunee]], WIS&nbsp;42 turns east on Krok Road to Lakeshore Drive, where it turns north and heads into the city as Milwaukee Street.\n\nIn downtown Kewaunee, WIS&nbsp;42 meets the eastern terminus of another state highway, [[Wisconsin Highway 29|WIS&nbsp;29]]. WIS&nbsp;42 becomes Main Street after crossing the [[Kewaunee River]] and continues north out of the city.\n\nIn the unincorporated town of [[Alaska, Wisconsin|Alaska]], WIS&nbsp;42 again turns east towards Lake Michigan to follow the shoreline into [[Algoma, Wisconsin|Algoma]] as Lake Street. In downtown Algoma, WIS&nbsp;42 turns north onto 4th Street and crosses the [[Ahnapee River]]. On the north bank of the river, WIS&nbsp;42 turns northwest onto North Water Street and follows the river in a northerly direction to [[Forestville, Wisconsin|Forestville]] in [[Door County, Wisconsin|Door County]], where it becomes Forestville Avenue.\n\n===Door County===\n[[File:WisconsinHighway42Curvy.jpg|thumb|Curvy section near northern terminus]]\n[[File:WisconsinHighway42NorthernTerminus.jpg|right|thumb|Northern terminus]]\nBecause of the geographical features and terrain of Door County, WIS&nbsp;42 makes many abrupt turns as it nears its northern terminus at the tip of the [[Door Peninsula]].\n\nAt its intersection with CTH-J in Forestville, WIS&nbsp;42 heads directly north into Door County. In the unincorporated community [[Maplewood, Wisconsin]], there is a small wayside park with parking, vault toilets and picnic tables in the center of town at the intersection of WIS&nbsp;42, [[County Trunk Highways (Wisconsin)|County Trunk]] H, and the [[Ahnapee State Trail]].<ref>[http://map.co.door.wi.us/parks/Ahnapee_Trail_DoorCo-Map.pdf Ahnapee Trail Door County Map]</ref> The wayside park is open a half hour before sunrise to 11 p.m.,<ref>[http://map.co.door.wi.us/parks/Parks%20Brochure%202017%20Website%20Final%20Copy.pdf Rules for All Door County Parks]</ref> although the trail is open all 24 hours. This is the only place where the trail crosses WIS&nbsp;42.\n\nPast Maplewood, WIS&nbsp;42 meets with [[Wisconsin Highway 57|WIS&nbsp;57]] a few miles southwest of [[Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin|Sturgeon Bay]], and heads to the northeast with WIS&nbsp;57 into the city as Green Bay Road. WIS&nbsp;42 and WIS&nbsp;57 are the only two state highways to enter Door County.\n\nWIS&nbsp;42/WIS&nbsp;57 crosses over the Sturgeon Bay Ship Canal to the southeast of downtown, bypassing the old Michigan Street bridge further upstream. A [[Wisconsin Highway 42 Business (Sturgeon Bay)|business route]] continues north on Green Bay Road to South Madison Avenue, crossing the canal on the Michigan Street bridge into downtown Sturgeon Bay. Turning left to the northwest on Third Avenue, the business route follows CTH-B to Jefferson Street, turning to the northeast on CTH-HH. CTH-HH jogs slightly north around Big Hill Park to Egg Harbor Road, where the business route turns northeast past the Door County Fairgrounds to its intersection with WIS&nbsp;42/WIS&nbsp;57 outside the city.\n\nWIS&nbsp;42 and 57 run concurrently for another mile to the north until WIS&nbsp;57 turns to the East at Johns Lane. WIS&nbsp;57 runs along the eastern shore of Door County until reaching its eastern terminus with WIS&nbsp;42 in [[Sister Bay, Wisconsin|Sister Bay]].\n\nWIS&nbsp;42 continues north on Egg Harbor Road to CTH-T just west of [[Egg Harbor, Wisconsin|Egg Harbor]]. It then swings around and along the shore of Egg Harbor before continuing to the northeast towards [[Fish Creek, Wisconsin|Fish Creek]].\n\nOutside of Fish Creek, WIS&nbsp;42 takes an abrupt left-hand turn to follow the bluff down to Main Street and the [[Alexander Noble House]]. WIS&nbsp;42 makes an abrupt right onto Main Street and heads to the northeast past [[Peninsula State Park]] into the unincorporated town of Eagle Harbor.\n\nIn Eagle Harbor, the road becomes Water Street as it runs along the shoreline of [[Green Bay (Lake Michigan)|Green Bay]]. It then curves to the northeast, becoming South Bay Shore Drive outside of Sister Bay. Meeting the northern terminus of [[Wisconsin Highway 57|WIS&nbsp;57]] at Gateway Drive, WIS&nbsp;42 once again swings to the northeast towards [[Ellison Bay, Wisconsin|Ellison Bay]].\n\nJust outside town, WIS&nbsp;42 turns due east on School Road to its intersection with Europe Bay Road, where it turns north towards [[Gills Rock, Wisconsin|Gills Rock]]. At Gills Rock, WIS&nbsp;42 turns due east and then turns slightly to the southeast before heading due east again to its eastern terminus at the [[Washington Island (Wisconsin)#Transportation|Washington Island Ferry]] dock at Port Des Morts Drive in unincorporated town of [[Northport, Door County, Wisconsin|Northport]].\n{{-}}\n\n==Major intersections==\n{{jcttop|length_ref=<ref name=WisDOT3>{{cite book |author= Region&nbsp;3 Staff |title= State Trunk Highway Log for Region&nbsp;3 |date= May 14, 2009 |publisher= [[Wisconsin Department of Transportation]] |location= Green Bay, WI |pages= 253\u2013276, 656}}</ref>}}\n{{WIint\n|county=Sheboygan\n|cspan=3\n|location=Sheboygan\n|mile=0.00\n|road={{jct|state=WI|WI|23|WI|28|Tour|LMCT|dir1=west|dir2=west}} (Erie Ave)\n|notes=Southern terminus}}\n{{WIint\n|location=Sheboygan\n|area=town\n|mile=3.43\n|road={{jct|state=WI|I|43|Tour|LMCT|city1=Milwaukee|city2=Green Bay}}\n|notes=Exit&nbsp;128 on I-43}}\n{{WIint\n|location=Howards Grove\n|mile=7.53\n|road={{jct|state=WI|WI|32|city1=Sheboygan Falls|city2=Kiel}}\n|notes=}}\n{{WIint\n|county=Manitowoc\n|cspan=6\n|location=Manitowoc\n|lspan=4\n|mile=26.18\n|type=concur\n|road={{jct|state=WI|US|151|dir1=south|city1=Chilton|city2=Fond du Lac}}\n|notes=Western end of US&nbsp;151 concurrency}}\n{{WIint\n|mile=26.58\n|mile2=26.81\n|type=concur\n|road={{jct|state=WI|I|43|Tour|LMCT|dir1=south|city1=Milwaukee}}<br/>{{jct|state=WI|US|151|WI-Bus|42|Tour|LMCT|dir1=north|dir2=north|city1=Manitowoc|dab2=Manitowoc}}\n|notes=Southern end of I-43 concurrency; eastern end of US&nbsp;151 concurrency; exit&nbsp;149 on I-43; southern terminus of Bus.

However, the exact location is unknown, most likely along today's [[WIS 28]].\n\n===Manitowoc business route===\nBusiness WIS 42 runs along WIS 42's older path before [[Interstate 43]] was completed. It is entirely concurrent with [[U.S. Route 10]] and [[U.S. Route 151]]. [[U.S. Route 141]] use to run along this route also. The business highway starts at U.S. 151 east of I-43 and continues along Calumet Avenue. It becomes Washington Street east of its intersection with Custer Street. It turns to the left at 8th Avenue to follow with U.S. 10 West, while Business WIS 42 southbound follows 11th and 10th Avenue along U.S. 10 East.

It starts off at an incomplete exit from WIS 42/57, and follows Green Bay Road to Madison Avenue. The road both turns right onto Maple Avenue, and continues onto Madison Avenue, then crossing the [[Sturgeon Bay]] on the [[Sturgeon Bay Bridge]] and the Oregon-Maple Street Bridge. They both meet up at the intersection of 3rd and Michigan, continuing onto 3rd Avenue. The route turns right onto Jefferson Street and follows 8th Avenue to Egg Harbor Road, where it continues for the rest of the route until terminating at a roundabout with WIS 42/57.\n\nIt used to follow Michigan Street all the way towards a roundabout for a brief time.\n\n===Gills Rock spur route===\nSpur WIS&nbsp;42 is a connecting route between WIS&nbsp;42 and the Island Clipper ferry in [[Gills Rock, Wisconsin|Gills Rock]]. The length of the spur is approximately {{convert|0.10|mi|m}},<ref name=WisDOT3/> the shortest highway in the Wisconsin state trunk highway system. The spur is one of three SPUR-designated state trunkline highways in the state along with Spur US&nbsp;51 and Spur WIS&nbsp;794.

The intersection is the terminus of two other state highways, [[Wisconsin Highway 23|WIS&nbsp;23]] and [[Wisconsin Highway 28|WIS&nbsp;28]].\n\nWIS&nbsp;42 follows North 14th Street to Calumet Drive, which heads out of the city in a northwesterly direction to its interchange with [[Interstate 43]] (I-43) at exit&nbsp;128 which has four [[roundabout]]s within a mile; two controlling freeway access, a retail development with [[Walmart]] and [[Menards]] at Vanguard Drive, and then CTH-Y. The route continues to the northwest into the city of [[Howards Grove, Wisconsin|Howards Grove]] past [[Howards Grove High School]], where it becomes Madison Avenue. Because there are only two exits in the {{convert|20|mi|km}} between WIS&nbsp;42's junctions with I-43 in Sheboygan and Manitowoc, it also serves as the state-designated Alternate I-43 (along with the roads from those two exits from WIS&nbsp;42) when road incidents close I-43 proper.\n\nAt the intersection of Madison Avenue and South Wisconsin Drive, WIS&nbsp;42 and [[Wisconsin Highway 32|WIS&nbsp;32]] meet. WIS&nbsp;32 continues to the northwest on Madison Avenue, while WIS&nbsp;42 turns north on Wisconsin Drive. WIS&nbsp;42 continues north out of Howards Grove into [[Manitowoc County, Wisconsin|Manitowoc County]]. While in southern Manitowoc County, WIS 42 intersects County Trunk Highway XX (CTH-XX), which leads east to I-43 and Cleveland, carrying it for about a mile before CTH-XX heads west towards Kiel in the community of [[Meeme (community), Wisconsin|Meeme]]. It intersects with CTH-C in the town of Newton, also leading east to I-43 while west towards St. Nazianz.\n\nWIS&nbsp;42 continues to the north towards the city of [[Manitowoc, Wisconsin|Manitowoc]], where it intersects [[U.S. Route 151|US&nbsp;151]] (Calumet Avenue) just west of I-43. Turning east, WIS&nbsp;42 [[concurrency (road)|runs concurrently]] with US&nbsp;151 for about a quarter mile (0.4&nbsp;km) before turning onto I-43 at exit&nbsp;149. WIS&nbsp;42 formerly ran east beyond the interchange with I-43 to South Rapids Road, following the road to the north to Waldo Boulevard and [[U.S. Route 10 in Wisconsin|US&nbsp;10]] on the north side of [[Manitowoc, Wisconsin|Manitowoc]]. WIS&nbsp;42 now runs north on I-43 to its interchange with CTH-JJ (exit&nbsp;152).\n\nWIS&nbsp;42 and US&nbsp;10 follow Waldo Boulevard to the shore of [[Lake Michigan]], running northeast along the shoreline on Memorial Drive out of the city and into [[Two Rivers, Wisconsin|Two Rivers]].\n\nCrossing the [[West Twin River (Wisconsin)|West Twin River]] near its confluence with the [[East Twin River (Wisconsin)|East Twin River]] just south of downtown Two Rivers, WIS&nbsp;42 becomes Washington Street. Two blocks north, it meets the eastern terminus of [[Wisconsin Highway 310|WIS&nbsp;310]] at 16th Street. Six blocks north, it meets the eastern terminus of [[Wisconsin Highway 147|WIS&nbsp;147]] at 22nd Street.\n\nWIS&nbsp;42 turns to the east on 22nd Street and crosses over the East Twin River, then turns north on Lincoln Avenue. WIS&nbsp;42 and WIS&nbsp;147 are the only two state highways that cross both branches of the Twin Rivers, though WIS&nbsp;147 does not cross the [[West Twin River (Wisconsin)|West Twin River]] until about a mile east of its terminus with I-43 near [[Maribel, Wisconsin|Maribel]].\n\nWIS&nbsp;42 continues to the north, running roughly parallel to the Lake Michigan shoreline into [[Kewaunee County, Wisconsin|Kewaunee County]]. Just south of the city of [[Kewaunee, Wisconsin|Kewaunee]], WIS&nbsp;42 turns east on Krok Road to Lakeshore Drive, where it turns north and heads into the city as Milwaukee Street.\n\nIn downtown Kewaunee, WIS&nbsp;42 meets the eastern terminus of another state highway, [[Wisconsin Highway 29|WIS&nbsp;29]]. WIS&nbsp;42 becomes Main Street after crossing the [[Kewaunee River]] and continues north out of the city.\n\nIn the unincorporated town of [[Alaska, Wisconsin|Alaska]], WIS&nbsp;42 again turns east towards Lake Michigan to follow the shoreline into [[Algoma, Wisconsin|Algoma]] as Lake Street. In downtown Algoma, WIS&nbsp;42 turns north onto 4th Street and crosses the [[Ahnapee River]]. On the north bank of the river, WIS&nbsp;42 turns northwest onto North Water Street and follows the river in a northerly direction to [[Forestville, Wisconsin|Forestville]] in [[Door County, Wisconsin|Door County]], where it becomes Forestville Avenue.\n\n===Door County===\n[[File:WisconsinHighway42Curvy.jpg|thumb|Curvy section near northern terminus]]\n[[File:WisconsinHighway42NorthernTerminus.jpg|right|thumb|Northern terminus]]\nBecause of the geographical features and terrain of Door County, WIS&nbsp;42 makes many abrupt turns as it nears its northern terminus at the tip of the [[Door Peninsula]].\n\nAt its intersection with CTH-J in Forestville, WIS&nbsp;42 heads directly north into Door County. In the unincorporated community [[Maplewood, Wisconsin]], there is a small wayside park with parking, vault toilets and picnic tables in the center of town at the intersection of WIS&nbsp;42, [[County Trunk Highways (Wisconsin)|County Trunk]] H, and the [[Ahnapee State Trail]].<ref>[http://map.co.door.wi.us/parks/Ahnapee_Trail_DoorCo-Map.pdf Ahnapee Trail Door County Map]</ref> The wayside park is open a half hour before sunrise to 11 p.m.,<ref>[http://map.co.door.wi.us/parks/Parks%20Brochure%202017%20Website%20Final%20Copy.pdf Rules for All Door County Parks]</ref> although the trail is open all 24 hours. This is the only place where the trail crosses WIS&nbsp;42.\n\nPast Maplewood, WIS&nbsp;42 meets with [[Wisconsin Highway 57|WIS&nbsp;57]] a few miles southwest of [[Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin|Sturgeon Bay]], and heads to the northeast with WIS&nbsp;57 into the city as Green Bay Road. WIS&nbsp;42 and WIS&nbsp;57 are the only two state highways to enter Door County.\n\nWIS&nbsp;42/WIS&nbsp;57 crosses over the Sturgeon Bay Ship Canal to the southeast of downtown, bypassing the old Michigan Street bridge further upstream. A [[Wisconsin Highway 42 Business (Sturgeon Bay)|business route]] continues north on Green Bay Road to South Madison Avenue, crossing the canal on the Michigan Street bridge into downtown Sturgeon Bay. Turning left to the northwest on Third Avenue, the business route follows CTH-B to Jefferson Street, turning to the northeast on CTH-HH. CTH-HH jogs slightly north around Big Hill Park to Egg Harbor Road, where the business route turns northeast past the Door County Fairgrounds to its intersection with WIS&nbsp;42/WIS&nbsp;57 outside the city.\n\nWIS&nbsp;42 and 57 run concurrently for another mile to the north until WIS&nbsp;57 turns to the East at Johns Lane. WIS&nbsp;57 runs along the eastern shore of Door County until reaching its eastern terminus with WIS&nbsp;42 in [[Sister Bay, Wisconsin|Sister Bay]].\n\nWIS&nbsp;42 continues north on Egg Harbor Road to CTH-T just west of [[Egg Harbor, Wisconsin|Egg Harbor]]. It then swings around and along the shore of Egg Harbor before continuing to the northeast towards [[Fish Creek, Wisconsin|Fish Creek]].\n\nOutside of Fish Creek, WIS&nbsp;42 takes an abrupt left-hand turn to follow the bluff down to Main Street and the [[Alexander Noble House]]. WIS&nbsp;42 makes an abrupt right onto Main Street and heads to the northeast past [[Peninsula State Park]] into the unincorporated town of Eagle Harbor.\n\nIn Eagle Harbor, the road becomes Water Street as it runs along the shoreline of [[Green Bay (Lake Michigan)|Green Bay]]. It then curves to the northeast, becoming South Bay Shore Drive outside of Sister Bay. Meeting the northern terminus of [[Wisconsin Highway 57|WIS&nbsp;57]] at Gateway Drive, WIS&nbsp;42 once again swings to the northeast towards [[Ellison Bay, Wisconsin|Ellison Bay]].\n\nJust outside town, WIS&nbsp;42 turns due east on School Road to its intersection with Europe Bay Road, where it turns north towards [[Gills Rock, Wisconsin|Gills Rock]]. At Gills Rock, WIS&nbsp;42 turns due east and then turns slightly to the southeast before heading due east again to its eastern terminus at the [[Washington Island (Wisconsin)#Transportation|Washington Island Ferry]] dock at Port Des Morts Drive in unincorporated town of [[Northport, Door County, Wisconsin|Northport]].\n{{-}}\n\n==Major intersections==\n{{jcttop|length_ref=<ref name=WisDOT3>{{cite book |author= Region&nbsp;3 Staff |title= State Trunk Highway Log for Region&nbsp;3 |date= May 14, 2009 |publisher= [[Wisconsin Department of Transportation]] |location= Green Bay, WI |pages= 253\u2013276, 656}}</ref>}}\n{{WIint\n|county=Sheboygan\n|cspan=3\n|location=Sheboygan\n|mile=0.00\n|road={{jct|state=WI|WI|23|WI|28|Tour|LMCT|dir1=west|dir2=west}} (Erie Ave)\n|notes=Southern terminus}}\n{{WIint\n|location=Sheboygan\n|area=town\n|mile=3.43\n|road={{jct|state=WI|I|43|Tour|LMCT|location1=[[Milwaukee]]|city2=Green Bay}}\n|notes=Exit&nbsp;128 on I-43}}\n{{WIint\n|location=Howards Grove\n|mile=7.53\n|road={{jct|state=WI|WI|32|city1=Sheboygan Falls|city2=Kiel}}\n|notes=}}\n{{WIint\n|county=Manitowoc\n|cspan=6\n|location=Manitowoc\n|lspan=4\n|mile=26.18\n|type=concur\n|road={{jct|state=WI|US|151|dir1=south|city1=Chilton|city2=Fond du Lac}}\n|notes=Western end of US&nbsp;151 concurrency}}\n{{WIint\n|mile=26.58\n|mile2=26.81\n|type=concur\n|road={{jct|state=WI|I|43|Tour|LMCT|dir1=south|location1=[[Milwaukee]]}}<br/>{{jct|state=WI|US|151|WI-Bus|42|Tour|LMCT|dir1=north|dir2=north|city1=Manitowoc|dab2=Manitowoc}}\n|notes=Southern end of I-43 concurrency; eastern end of US&nbsp;151 concurrency; exit&nbsp;149 on I-43; southern terminus of Bus.

However, the exact location is unknown, most likely along today's [[WIS 28]].\n\n===Manitowoc business route===\nBusiness WIS 42 runs along WIS 42's older path before [[Interstate 43]] was completed. It is entirely concurrent with [[U.S. Route 10]] and [[U.S. Route 151]]. [[U.S. Route 141]] use to run along this route also. The business highway starts at U.S. 151 east of I-43 and continues along Calumet Avenue. It becomes Washington Street east of its intersection with Custer Street. It turns to the left at 8th Avenue to follow with U.S. 10 West, while Business WIS 42 southbound follows 11th and 10th Avenue along U.S. 10 East. It then joins WIS 42 at Waldo Boulevard.\n\n===Sturgeon Bay business route===\n[[File:Sturgeon Bay Bridge from north (2013).jpg|left|thumb|WIS 42/57 used to run across the Sturgeon Bay via the Sturgeon Bay Bridge until the Bayview Bridge opened in 1978.

It starts off at an incomplete exit from WIS 42/57, and follows Green Bay Road to Madison Avenue. The road both turns right onto Maple Avenue, and continues onto Madison Avenue, then crossing the [[Sturgeon Bay]] on the [[Sturgeon Bay Bridge]] and the Oregon-Maple Street Bridge. They both meet up at the intersection of 3rd and Michigan, continuing onto 3rd Avenue. The route turns right onto Jefferson Street and follows 8th Avenue to Egg Harbor Road, where it continues for the rest of the route until terminating at a roundabout with WIS 42/57.\n\nIt used to follow Michigan Street all the way towards a roundabout for a brief time.\n\n===Gills Rock spur route===\nSpur WIS&nbsp;42 is a connecting route between WIS&nbsp;42 and the Island Clipper ferry in [[Gills Rock, Wisconsin|Gills Rock]]. The length of the spur is approximately {{convert|0.10|mi|m}},<ref name=WisDOT3/> the shortest highway in the Wisconsin state trunk highway system. The spur is one of three SPUR-designated state trunkline highways in the state along with Spur US&nbsp;51 and Spur WIS&nbsp;794. The [[Gills Rock, Wisconsin|Gills Rock]] ferry is a passenger-only ferry, where the one at [[Northport, Door County, Wisconsin|Northport]] is an auto, freight and passenger ferry.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Wisconsin Scenic Byways#Door County Coastal Byway|Door County Coastal Byway]] (WIS 42 and 57 north of Sturgeon Bay to Northport is classified as a Coastal Byway)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Commons category-inline|Wisconsin Highway 42}}\n\n[[Category:State highways in Wisconsin|042]]\n[[Category:Lake Michigan Circle Tour]]\n", "name_user": "Greggens", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eMajor intersections:minor adjustments", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin_Highway_42"}

This brings the Line Islands into the same day as the Kiribati Islands. Kiribati's easternmost islands, the southern Line Islands, south of [[Hawaii]], have the most advanced time on Earth: [[UTC+14:00|UTC+14]] hours. Kiribati is the only country in the world to be situated in all four hemispheres.\n\nKiribati gained its independence from the [[United Kingdom]], becoming  a [[sovereign state]] in 1979. The capital, [[South Tarawa]], now the most populated area, consists of a number of islets, connected by a series of [[causeway]]s. These comprise about half the area of [[Tarawa]] Atoll.\n\nKiribati is a member of the [[Pacific Community]] (SPC), [[Commonwealth of Nations]], the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], and the [[World Bank]], and became a full member of the [[United Nations]] in 1999.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Kiribati'' was adopted in 1979 at independence. It is the [[Gilbertese]] rendition of ''Gilberts''. This name derives from the English pronunciation of the name of the main archipelago that forms the nation. It was named in 1820 by [[Adam Johann von Krusenstern]] as \u00ab \u00eeles Gilbert \u00bb, in English the [[Gilbert Islands]], after the British [[Sea captain|captain]] [[Thomas Gilbert (sea captain)|Thomas Gilbert]]. He and captain [[John Marshall (Royal Navy officer)|John Marshall]] sighted some of the islands in 1788, while crossing the Outer Passage route from [[Port Jackson]] to [[Guangzhou|Canton]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Yeu4MnVVss0C&pg=PA15&lpg=PA15&dq=outer+passage+route+port+jackson+canton#v=onepage|title=Cinderellas of the Empire: Towards a History of Kiribati and Tuvalu|first=Barrie|last=Macdonald|date=6 December 2001|publisher=editorips@usp.ac.fj|isbn=9789820203358|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref name=LifeMagazine1944-05-22>\n{{cite news |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=bk8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA91 |title = The Gilberts & Marshalls: A distinguished historian recalls the past of two recently captured pacific groups |journal= [[Life (magazine)|Life]] |date = 1944-05-22 |author = Samuel Eliot Morison |accessdate = 2009-10-14 |author-link = Samuel Eliot Morison }}</ref>\n\nThe main archipelago was named ''\u00eeles Gilbert'' (''Gilbert Islands'' in English) in about 1820 by Russian admiral [[Adam Johann von Krusenstern|Adam von Krusenstern]] and French captain [[Louis Isidore Duperrey|Louis Duperrey]]. Both of their maps, published in 1820, were written in French. In English, the archipelago, the Southern part notably, was often referred to as the Kingsmills in the 19th century, although the name Gilbert Islands was used increasingly, including in the [[British Western Pacific Territories|Western Pacific Order in Council]] of 1877 and in the Pacific Order of 1893.<ref>[http://www.paclii.org/sb/legis/sb-uk_act/po189395.rtf]</ref>\n\nThe name Gilbert was incorporated into the name of the entire [[Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony]] from 1916 and was retained after the Ellice Islands became the separate nation of [[Tuvalu]] in 1976. The spelling of ''Gilberts'' in the [[Gilbertese language]] as Kiribati may be found in books in Gilbertese prepared by missionaries and others (see e.g. Hawaiian Board of Missionaries, 1895).<ref>{{cite book|author=Hawaiian board of missions, publishers|title=Te Rikitianere ni baibara, ae te boki ni kaoti nanon taeka ianena aika 376 aika n te baibara ni kiribati: ma te kankaotanti ae karako.

These [[indigenous peoples]] were then visited by early [[Austronesian]] seafarers from the west, orally described as being tall and fair skinned. Eventually, both groups intermittently clashed and intermingled until they slowly became a uniform population.\n\nAround 1300 A.D, there was a mass exodus from [[Samoa]] at the same time that [[Cannibalism]] was forcefully abolished there, leading to the addition of Polynesian ancestry into the mix of most I-Kiribati people. These Samoans would later bring strong features of Polynesian languages and culture, creating clans based on their own Samoan traditions and slowly intertwining with the indigenous clans and powers already dominant in Kiribati.\n\nAround the 15th century, with the stark contrasting systems of governance between the Northern Islands, primarily under chiefly rule (Uea), and the Central and Southern Islands, primarily under the rule of their council of elders (Unimwaane)\u2013with the exception of [[Tabiteuea]], the sole island that maintained a traditional [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] society (Tabiteuea stemming from the root phrase Tabu-Te-Uea meaning \"Chiefs are forbidden\")\u2013civil war soon became a factor, with acquisition of land being the main form of conquest. Clans and chiefs began fighting over resources, fuelled by hatred and reignited blood feuds, which may have happened months or decades before. \n\nThe turmoil would last well into the European visitation and colonial era, which led to certain islands decimating their foes with the help of guns and cannon-equipped ships that some Europeans were coerced into using by the more cunning and persuasive among the I-Kiribati leaders. \n\nThe typical military arms of the I-Kiribati at this time were shark-tooth-embedded wooden spears, knives and swords, and garbs of armour fashioned from dense coconut fibre. They chiefly used these instead of the gunpowder and weapons of steel available at the time, because of the strong sentimental value of the equipment handed down through generations. Ranged weapons, such as bows, slings and javelins, were seldom used; [[Culture of Kiribati#Kiribati traditional martial arts|hand-to-hand combat]] was a prominent skill still practised today, though seldom mentioned because of various taboos associated with it, secrecy being the primary one.\n\n[[Abemama]]'s High Chief [[Tembinok']] would be the last of the dozens of expansionist Chiefs of Kiribati of this period, despite Abemama historically conforming to the traditional Southern Island's governance of their respective \u201cunimwaane\u201d. He would be immortalised in [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s book \"In the South Seas\", which delved into the High Chief's character and method of rule during Stevenson's stay in Abemama.\n\n===Colonial Era===\n{{Main|British Western Pacific Territories|Gilbert and Ellice Islands}}\nChance visits by European ships occurred in the 17th and 18th centuries,<ref>{{cite journal|author=Maude, H.

That was eventually resolved and they became part of Kiribati under the [[Treaty of Tarawa]]. That was signed shortly after independence and ratified in 1983, the United States relinquishing all claims to the sparsely-inhabited Phoenix Islands, and those of the Line Islands that are part of Kiribati territory.\n\n[[File:Tarawa.jpg|thumb|American Marines assault a Japanese bunker during the [[Battle of Tarawa]], November 1943.]]\n[[Tarawa Atoll]], and others of the Gilbert group, were occupied by Japan from 1941 to 1943, during [[World War II]].

The executive branch consists of a president (''te Beretitenti''), a vice-president and a cabinet. The president, who is also chief of the cabinet, is directly elected by the people, after the legislature nominates three or four persons from among its members to be candidates in the ensuing presidential election. The president is limited in the terms they can serve for to three four-year terms. He remains a member of the Assembly while serving as president. The cabinet is composed of the president, vice-president, and 10 ministers (appointed by the president) who are also members of the House of Assembly.\n\nThe legislative branch is the unicameral ''Maneaba Ni Maungatabu'' (House of Assembly). Its members are elected, including by constitutional mandate a representative of the Banaban people in [[Fiji]] (Banaba Island, former Ocean Island), in addition to the attorney general, who serves as an ''ex-officio'' member. Legislators serve for a four-year term.\n\nThe constitutional provisions governing administration of justice are similar to those in other former British possessions in that the judiciary is free from governmental interference. The judicial branch is made up of the High Court (in Betio) and the Court of Appeal. The president appoints the presiding judges.\n\nLocal government is through island councils with elected members. Local affairs are handled in a manner similar to town meetings in colonial America. Island councils make their own estimates of revenue and expenditure and generally are free from central government controls. There are a total of 21 inhabited islands in Kiribati. Each inhabited island has its own council. Since independence, Kiribati is no longer divided into districts (see [[Districts of Kiribati|Subdivisions of Kiribati]]).\n\nKiribati has formal political parties but their organisation is quite informal. Ad&nbsp;hoc opposition groups tend to coalesce around specific issues. Today the only recognisable parties are the ''Boutokaan te Koaua'' Party, ''Maneaban te Mauri'' Party, ''Maurin Kiribati'' Party and ''Tabomoa'' Party.

Commercially viable [[phosphate]] deposits on [[Banaba Island|Banaba]] were exhausted at the time of independence. [[Copra]] and fish now represent the bulk of production and exports. Kiribati is considered one of the [[Least developed country|least developed countries]] in the world.\n\nIn one form or another, Kiribati gets a large portion of its income from abroad. Examples include fishing licenses, development assistance, worker [[remittance]]s, and tourism. Given Kiribati's limited domestic production ability, it must import nearly all of its essential foodstuffs and manufactured items; it depends on these external sources of income for financing.\n\nThe economy of Kiribati benefits from international development assistance programs. The multilateral donors providing development assistance in 2009 were the [[European Union]] (A$9 million), the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (A$3.7 million), UNICEF, and the [[World Health Organization]] (A$100,000).<ref name=\"IMF 2011 SA\"/> The bilateral donors providing development assistance in 2009 were Australia (A$11 million), Japan (A$2 million), [[New Zealand]] (A$6.6 million), [[Taiwan]] (A$10.6 million), and other donors providing A$16.2 million, including technical assistance grants from the [[Asian Development Bank]].<ref name=\"IMF 2011 SA\">{{cite web |title = Kiribati: Statistical Appendix |url = https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.aspx?sk=24872.0 |publisher = International Monetary Fund Country Report No. 11/114 |date = 24 May 2011 |accessdate = 10 September 2011 }}</ref><ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web |title = Kiribati: 2011 Article IV Consultation-Staff Report, Informational Annexes, Debt Sustainability Analysis, Public Information Notice on the Executive Board Discussion, and Statement by the Executive Director for Kiribati |url = https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.aspx?sk=24871.0 |publisher = International Monetary Fund Country Report No. 11/113 |date = 24 May 2011 |accessdate = 10 September 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe major donors in 2010/2011 were Australia (A$15 million), Taiwan (A$11 million); New Zealand (A$6 million), the [[World Bank]] (A$4 million) and the [[Asian Development Bank]].<ref name=mfat>{{cite web |url = http://www.mfat.govt.nz/Countries/Pacific/Kiribati.php |title = New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) |accessdate = 10 September 2010 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1956, Kiribati established a [[sovereign wealth fund]] to act as a store of wealth for the country's earnings from [[phosphate]] mining.\nIn 2008, the [[Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund]] was valued at US$400 million.<ref>[http://www.swfinstitute.org/fund/kiribati.php Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute].

It is estimated to have grown by 1.75% for the year. Despite a weather-related drop in copra production, private sector activity appears to have picked up, especially in retail. Tourist arrivals rebounded by 20% compared to 2009, although from a very low base.\nDespite the rise in world food and fuel prices, inflation has bounced from 2008 crisis-highs into negative territory, reflecting the strong appreciation of the Australian dollar, which is used as the domestic currency, and a decline in the world price of rice. Credit growth in the overall economy declined in 2009 as economic activity stalled.

Most houses are made of materials obtained from coconut and pandanus trees. Frequent droughts and infertile soil hinder reliable large-scale agriculture, so the islanders have largely turned to the sea for livelihood and subsistence. Most are outrigger sailors and fishermen. Copra plantations serve as a second source of employment. In recent years large numbers of citizens have moved to the more urban island capital of Tarawa.

Ethnically, the I-Kiribati are [[Micronesia]]ns. Recent archaeological evidence indicates that [[Austronesians]] originally settled the islands thousands of years ago. Around the 14th century, Fijians, Samoans, and Tongans invaded the islands, thus diversifying the ethnic range and introducing [[Polynesian languages|Polynesian]] linguistic traits. Intermarriage among all ancestral groups, however, has led to a population reasonably homogeneous in appearance and traditions.\n\n=== Languages ===\nThe people of Kiribati speak an [[Oceanic languages|Oceanic language]] called [[Gilbertese language|Gilbertese]]. Although English is also an [[official language]], it is not used very often outside the island capital of [[Tarawa]]. It is more likely that English is mixed in its use with Gilbertese. Older generations of I-Kiribati tend to use more complicated versions of the language.

Public performances in modern Kiribati are generally performed by a seated chorus, accompanied by a guitar. However, during formal performances of the standing dance (''Te Kaimatoa'') or the hip dance (''Te Buki''), a wooden box is used as a percussion instrument. This box is constructed to give a hollow and reverberating tone when struck simultaneously by a chorus of men sitting around it. Traditional songs are often love-themed, but there are also competitive, religious, children's, patriotic, war and wedding songs. There are also [[tirere|stick dance]]s which accompany legends and semi-historical stories {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. These stick dances or \"tirere\" (pronounced seerere) are performed only during major festivals.\n\n===Dance===\n{{main|Dance in Kiribati}}\n[[File:Bonriki International Airport welcome.jpg|thumb|A welcome display.]]\nThe uniqueness of Kiribati when compared with other forms of Pacific island dance is its emphasis on the outstretched arms of the dancer and the sudden birdlike movement of the head. The [[Great frigatebird|Frigate bird]] (''Fregata minor'') on the Kiribati flag refers to this bird-like style of Kiribati dancing. Most dances are in the standing or sitting position with movement limited and staggered. Smiling whilst dancing is generally considered vulgar within the context of Kiribati dancing. This is due to its origin of not being solely as a form of entertainment but as a form of storytelling and a display of the skill, beauty and endurance of the dancer.<ref>[[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s ''In the South Seas'' and the [[Montana New Zealand Book Awards]] winner ''Akekeia!'' by Tony & Joan Whincup, Wellington, 2001.</ref>\n\n===Sport===\n{{see also|Kiribati at the Olympics|Kiribati at the 2014 Commonwealth Games}}\nKiribati has competed at the [[Commonwealth Games]] since [[1998 Commonwealth Games|1998]] and the [[Summer Olympics]] since [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]].

This brings the Line Islands into the same day as the Kiribati Islands. Kiribati's easternmost islands, the southern Line Islands, south of [[Hawaii]], have the most advanced time on Earth: [[UTC+14:00|UTC+14]] hours. Kiribati is the only country in the world to be situated in all four hemispheres.\n\nKiribati gained its independence from the [[United Kingdom]], becoming  a [[sovereign state]] in 1979. The capital, [[South Tarawa]], now the most populated area, consists of a number of islets, connected by a series of [[causeway]]s. These comprise about half the area of [[Tarawa]] Atoll.\n\nKiribati is a member of the [[Pacific Community]] (SPC), [[Commonwealth of Nations]], the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], and the [[World Bank]], and became a full member of the [[United Nations]] in 1999.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Kiribati'' was adopted in 1979 at independence. It is the [[Gilbertese]] rendition of ''Gilberts''. This name derives from the English pronunciation of the name of the main archipelago that forms the nation. It was named in 1820 by [[Adam Johann von Krusenstern]] as \u00ab \u00eeles Gilbert \u00bb, in English the [[Gilbert Islands]], after the British [[Sea captain|captain]] [[Thomas Gilbert (sea captain)|Thomas Gilbert]]. He and captain [[John Marshall (Royal Navy officer)|John Marshall]] sighted some of the islands in 1788, while crossing the Outer Passage route from [[Port Jackson]] to [[Guangzhou|Canton]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Yeu4MnVVss0C&pg=PA15&lpg=PA15&dq=outer+passage+route+port+jackson+canton#v=onepage|title=Cinderellas of the Empire: Towards a History of Kiribati and Tuvalu|first=Barrie|last=Macdonald|date=6 December 2001|publisher=editorips@usp.ac.fj|isbn=9789820203358|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref name=LifeMagazine1944-05-22>\n{{cite news |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=bk8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA91 |title = The Gilberts & Marshalls: A distinguished historian recalls the past of two recently captured pacific groups |journal= [[Life (magazine)|Life]] |date = 1944-05-22 |author = Samuel Eliot Morison |accessdate = 2009-10-14 |author-link = Samuel Eliot Morison }}</ref>\n\nThe main archipelago was named ''\u00eeles Gilbert'' (''Gilbert Islands'' in English) in about 1820 by Russian admiral [[Adam Johann von Krusenstern|Adam von Krusenstern]] and French captain [[Louis Isidore Duperrey|Louis Duperrey]]. Both of their maps, published in 1820, were written in French. In English, the archipelago, the Southern part notably, was often referred to as the Kingsmills in the 19th century, although the name Gilbert Islands was used increasingly, including in the [[British Western Pacific Territories|Western Pacific Order in Council]] of 1877 and in the Pacific Order of 1893.<ref>[http://www.paclii.org/sb/legis/sb-uk_act/po189395.rtf]</ref>\n\nThe name Gilbert was incorporated into the name of the entire [[Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony]] from 1916 and was retained after the Ellice Islands became the separate nation of [[Tuvalu]] in 1976. The spelling of ''Gilberts'' in the [[Gilbertese language]] as Kiribati may be found in books in Gilbertese prepared by missionaries and others (see e.g. Hawaiian Board of Missionaries, 1895).<ref>{{cite book|author=Hawaiian board of missions, publishers|title=Te Rikitianere ni baibara, ae te boki ni kaoti nanon taeka ianena aika 376 aika n te baibara ni kiribati: ma te kankaotanti ae karako.

Intermarriage tended to blur cultural differences and resulted in a significant degree of cultural homogenisation.<ref name=brit/><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20091014051525/http://www.mfep.gov.ki/Facts%20and%20Background.htm Background Note: Kiribati]. mfep.gov.ki</ref> Local oral historians in the form of chiefly lore keepers suggest that the area was first inhabited by a group of seafaring people from [[Melanesia]], who were described as being dark skinned, frizzy haired and short in stature. These [[indigenous peoples]] were then visited by early [[Austronesian]] seafarers from the west, orally described as being tall and fair skinned. Eventually, both groups intermittently clashed and intermingled until they slowly became a uniform population.\n\nAround 1300 A.D, there was a mass exodus from [[Samoa]] at the same time that [[Cannibalism]] was forcefully abolished there, leading to the addition of Polynesian ancestry into the mix of most I-Kiribati people. These Samoans would later bring strong features of Polynesian languages and culture, creating clans based on their own Samoan traditions and slowly intertwining with the indigenous clans and powers already dominant in Kiribati.\n\nAround the 15th century, with the stark contrasting systems of governance between the Northern Islands, primarily under chiefly rule (Uea), and the Central and Southern Islands, primarily under the rule of their council of elders (Unimwaane)\u2013with the exception of [[Tabiteuea]], the sole island that maintained a traditional [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] society (Tabiteuea stemming from the root phrase Tabu-Te-Uea meaning \"Chiefs are forbidden\")\u2013civil war soon became a factor, with acquisition of land being the main form of conquest. Clans and chiefs began fighting over resources, fuelled by hatred and reignited blood feuds, which may have happened months or decades before. \n\nThe turmoil would last well into the European visitation and colonial era, which led to certain islands decimating their foes with the help of guns and cannon-equipped ships that some Europeans were coerced into using by the more cunning and persuasive among the I-Kiribati leaders. \n\nThe typical military arms of the I-Kiribati at this time were shark-tooth-embedded wooden spears, knives and swords, and garbs of armour fashioned from dense coconut fibre. They chiefly used these instead of the gunpowder and weapons of steel available at the time, because of the strong sentimental value of the equipment handed down through generations. Ranged weapons, such as bows, slings and javelins, were seldom used; [[Culture of Kiribati#Kiribati traditional martial arts|hand-to-hand combat]] was a prominent skill still practised today, though seldom mentioned because of various taboos associated with it, secrecy being the primary one.\n\n[[Abemama]]'s High Chief [[Tembinok']] would be the last of the dozens of expansionist Chiefs of Kiribati of this period, despite Abemama historically conforming to the traditional Southern Island's governance of their respective \u201cunimwaane\u201d. He would be immortalised in [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s book \"In the South Seas\", which delved into the High Chief's character and method of rule during Stevenson's stay in Abemama.\n\n===Colonial Era===\n{{Main|British Western Pacific Territories|Gilbert and Ellice Islands}}\nChance visits by European ships occurred in the 17th and 18th centuries,<ref>{{cite journal|author=Maude, H.

That was eventually resolved and they became part of Kiribati under the [[Treaty of Tarawa]]. That was signed shortly after independence and ratified in 1983, the United States relinquishing all claims to the sparsely-inhabited Phoenix Islands, and those of the Line Islands that are part of Kiribati territory.\n\n[[File:Tarawa.jpg|thumb|American Marines assault a Japanese bunker during the [[Battle of Tarawa]], November 1943.]]\n[[Tarawa Atoll]], and others of the Gilbert group, were occupied by Japan from 1941 to 1943, during [[World War II]].

The executive branch consists of a president (''te Beretitenti''), a vice-president and a cabinet. The president, who is also chief of the cabinet, is directly elected by the people, after the legislature nominates three or four persons from among its members to be candidates in the ensuing presidential election. The president is limited in the terms they can serve for to three four-year terms. He remains a member of the Assembly while serving as president. The cabinet is composed of the president, vice-president, and 10 ministers (appointed by the president) who are also members of the House of Assembly.\n\nThe legislative branch is the unicameral ''Maneaba Ni Maungatabu'' (House of Assembly). Its members are elected, including by constitutional mandate a representative of the Banaban people in [[Fiji]] (Banaba Island, former Ocean Island), in addition to the attorney general, who serves as an ''ex-officio'' member. Legislators serve for a four-year term.\n\nThe constitutional provisions governing administration of justice are similar to those in other former British possessions in that the judiciary is free from governmental interference. The judicial branch is made up of the High Court (in Betio) and the Court of Appeal. The president appoints the presiding judges.\n\nLocal government is through island councils with elected members. Local affairs are handled in a manner similar to town meetings in colonial America. Island councils make their own estimates of revenue and expenditure and generally are free from central government controls. There are a total of 21 inhabited islands in Kiribati. Each inhabited island has its own council. Since independence, Kiribati is no longer divided into districts (see [[Districts of Kiribati|Subdivisions of Kiribati]]).\n\nKiribati has formal political parties but their organisation is quite informal. Ad&nbsp;hoc opposition groups tend to coalesce around specific issues. Today the only recognisable parties are the ''Boutokaan te Koaua'' Party, ''Maneaban te Mauri'' Party, ''Maurin Kiribati'' Party and ''Tabomoa'' Party. There is universal suffrage at age 18.\n\n===Foreign relations===\n{{Main|Foreign relations of Kiribati}}\n\nKiribati maintains close relations with its Pacific neighbours, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and Fiji. The first three of these provide the majority of the country's foreign aid.

Kiribati is a member of the [[Alliance of Small Island States]] (AOSIS), an intergovernmental organisation of low-lying coastal and small island countries.\nEstablished in 1990, the main purpose of the alliance is to consolidate the voices of [[Small Island Developing States]] (SIDS) to address global warming. AOSIS has been very active from its inception, putting forward the first draft text in the [[Kyoto Protocol]] negotiations as early as 1994.\n\nIn 2009, President Tong attended the [[Climate Vulnerable Forum]] ([[Climate Vulnerable Forum|V11]]) in the [[Maldives]], with 10 other countries that are vulnerable to climate change, and signed the Bandos Island declaration on 10 November 2009, pledging to show moral leadership and commence greening their economies by voluntarily committing to achieving [[carbon neutrality]].\n\nIn November 2010, Kiribati hosted the [[Tarawa Climate Change Conference]] (TCCC) to support the president of Kiribati's initiative to hold a consultative forum between vulnerable states and their partners. The conference strove to create an enabling environment for multi-party negotiations under the auspices of the UNFCCC. The conference was a successor event to the Climate Vulnerable Forum.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.climate.gov.ki/tarawa_climate_change_conference.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202030155/http://www.climate.gov.ki/tarawa_climate_change_conference.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2 February 2012 |title=Climate Change in Kiribati, Tarawa Climate Change Conference Issues Ambo Declaration |publisher=Office of the President of Kiribati |date=12 November 2010 |accessdate=28 April 2018}}</ref> The ultimate objective of TCCC was to reduce the number and intensity of fault lines between parties to the COP process, explore elements of agreement between the parties and thereby to support Kiribati's and other parties' contribution to [[COP16]] held in [[Cancun]], [[Mexico]], from 29 November to 10 December 2010.\n\nIn 2013, President Tong has spoken of climate-change induced sea level rise as \"inevitable\". \"For our people to survive, then they will have to migrate.

Ethnically, the I-Kiribati are [[Micronesia]]ns. Recent archaeological evidence indicates that [[Austronesians]] originally settled the islands thousands of years ago. Around the 14th century, Fijians, Samoans, and Tongans invaded the islands, thus diversifying the ethnic range and introducing [[Polynesian languages|Polynesian]] linguistic traits.

Several words in Gilbertese have been adopted from European settlers, for instance, ''kamea'' is the Gilbertese word for dog,<ref>[http://www.trussel.com/kir/glossary.htm Te taetae ni Kiribati \u2013 Kiribati Language Lessons \u2013 Glossary].

In the early 2000s, between 1 and 7% of the population, depending on the island, were annually treated for food poisoning in a hospital. Modernization and cross-cultural exchange of the late 20th century brought new issues of unhealthy diet and lifestyle; heavy smoking, especially among the young population; and external infections, including HIV/AIDS.<ref name=t8>[[#Thomas|Thomas]], 8\u20139</ref>\n\nKiribati is the country with the third highest prevalence of smoking, with 54% of the population reported as smokers.<ref>[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2014-01-08/india/45990577_1_smokeless-tobacco-smokers-tobacco-use \"Number of smokers up by 35 million in 30 years, study finds\"].

Public performances in modern Kiribati are generally performed by a seated chorus, accompanied by a guitar. However, during formal performances of the standing dance (''Te Kaimatoa'') or the hip dance (''Te Buki''), a wooden box is used as a percussion instrument. This box is constructed to give a hollow and reverberating tone when struck simultaneously by a chorus of men sitting around it. Traditional songs are often love-themed, but there are also competitive, religious, children's, patriotic, war and wedding songs. There are also [[tirere|stick dance]]s which accompany legends and semi-historical stories {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. These stick dances or \"tirere\" (pronounced seerere) are performed only during major festivals.\n\n===Dance===\n{{main|Dance in Kiribati}}\n[[File:Bonriki International Airport welcome.jpg|thumb|A welcome display.]]\nThe uniqueness of Kiribati when compared with other forms of Pacific island dance is its emphasis on the outstretched arms of the dancer and the sudden birdlike movement of the head. The [[Great frigatebird|Frigate bird]] (''Fregata minor'') on the Kiribati flag refers to this bird-like style of Kiribati dancing. Most dances are in the standing or sitting position with movement limited and staggered. Smiling whilst dancing is generally considered vulgar within the context of Kiribati dancing. This is due to its origin of not being solely as a form of entertainment but as a form of storytelling and a display of the skill, beauty and endurance of the dancer.<ref>[[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s ''In the South Seas'' and the [[Montana New Zealand Book Awards]] winner ''Akekeia!'' by Tony & Joan Whincup, Wellington, 2001.</ref>\n\n===Sport===\n{{see also|Kiribati at the Olympics|Kiribati at the 2014 Commonwealth Games}}\nKiribati has competed at the [[Commonwealth Games]] since [[1998 Commonwealth Games|1998]] and the [[Summer Olympics]] since [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]].
