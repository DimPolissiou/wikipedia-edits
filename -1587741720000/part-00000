It was the capital of the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] (or Muscovy), from 1340 to 1547 and in 1713 renamed as the  [[Tsardom of Russia]] by Peter I \"the Great\" (when the capital was moved to [[Saint Petersburg]]). Moscow was the capital of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] from 1918, which then became the [[Soviet Union]] (1922 to 1991), and since 1991 has served as capital of the [[Russian Federation]].\n\nSituated on either bank of the eponymous [[Moskva River]], the city during the 16th to 17th centuries grew up in five concentric divisions, formerly separated from one another by walls: the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]] (\"fortress\"), [[Kitaigorod]] (\"walled town\", but interpreted as \"Chinatown\" by [[folk etymology]]), [[Bielygorod]] (\"white town\"), [[Zemlianoigorod]] (\"earthworks town\"), and [[Miestchanskygorod]] (\"bourgeois town\") outside the city walls.\n\nAfter the [[Fire of Moscow (1812)|fire of 1812]], the city ramparts were replaced with the [[Boulevard Ring]] and [[Garden Ring]] roads, replacing the walls around Bielygorod and Zemlianoigorod, respectively. The city's population grew from 250,000 to over a million in the 19th century, and from one to ten million in the 20th century, putting it among the top twenty of the [[World's largest cities|world's most populous cities]] today.\n\n==Prehistory==\nThe oldest evidence of humans on the territory of Moscow dates from the [[Neolithic]] (Schukinskaya site on the [[Moscow River]]). Within the modern bounds of the city other late evidence was discovered (the burial ground of the [[Fatyanovo\u2013Balanovo culture|Fatyanovskaya culture]], the site of the [[Iron Age]] settlement of the [[Dyakovo culture]]), on the territory of the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]], [[Sparrow Hills]], [[Setun River]] and Kuntsevskiy forest park, etc.\n\nThe etymology of the name ''Moskva'' is [[Uralic languages|Uralic]], perhaps [[Volga-Finnic languages|Volga-Finnic]] ([[Mordvinic]] or [[Merya]]{{Clarify|date=April 2011}}).\n\nIn the 9th century, the [[Oka River]] was part of the [[Volga trade route]], and the upper Volga watershed became an area of contact between the indigenous Uralic peoples such as the [[Merya]] and the expanding [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] ([[Volga Bulgars]]), [[Germanic people|Germanic]] ([[Varangians]]) and [[early Slavs|Slavic]] peoples.\n\nThe earliest [[early East Slavs|East Slavic]] tribes recorded as having expanded to the upper Volga in the 9th to 10th centuries are the [[Vyatichi]] and [[Krivichi]].\nThe Moskva River was incorporated as part of [[Rostov-Suzdal]] into the [[Kievan Rus]] in the 11th century. By AD 1100, a minor settlement had appeared on the mouth of the [[Neglinnaya River]].\n\n==Early history (1147\u20131283)==\n{{further|Kievan Rus|Vladimir-Suzdal}}\nThe first reference to Moscow dates from 1147 as a meeting place of [[Yuri Dolgorukiy]] and [[Sviatoslav Olgovich]]. At the time it was a minor town on the western border of Vladimir-Suzdal Principality.\n\nIn 1156, [[Kniaz]] [[Yury Dolgoruky]] fortified the town with a timber fence and a moat. In the course of the [[Mongol invasion of Rus]],  the [[Golden Horde]] burned the city to the ground and killed its inhabitants.\n\nThe timber fort ''na Moskv\u011b'' \"on the Moscow river\" was inherited by [[Daniel of Moscow|Daniel]], the youngest son of [[Alexander Nevsky]], in the 1260s, at the time considered the least valuable of his father's possessions.\nDaniel was still a child at the time, and the fort was governed by ''tiuns'' (deputies), appointed by Daniel's paternal uncle, [[Yaroslav of Tver]].\n\nDaniel came of age in the 1270s and became involved in the power struggles of the principality with lasting success, siding with his brother [[Dmitry of Pereslavl|Dmitry]] in his bid for the rule of Novgorod. From 1283 he acted as the ruler of an independent principality alongside Dmitry, who became Grand Duke of Vladimir.\nDaniel has been credited with founding the first Moscow monasteries, dedicated to the Lord's Epiphany and to Saint Daniel.\n\n==Grand Duchy (1283\u20131547)==\n{{Main|Grand Duchy of Moscow}}\nDaniel ruled Moscow as Grand Duke until 1303 and established it as a prosperous city which would eventually eclipse its parent principality of Vladimir by the 1320s.\n\nIn 1282 Daniel founded the first monastery of Moscow on the right bank of the [[Moskva River]], the wooden church of St. Daniel-Stylite. It is now known as the [[Danilov Monastery]]. Daniel died in 1303, at the age of 42. Before his death he became a monk and, according to his will, was buried in the cemetery of the St. Daniel Monastery.\n\nMoscow was stable and prosperous for many years and attracted a large numbers of refugees from across Russia. The Rurikids maintained large landholdings by practicing [[primogeniture]], whereby all land was passed to the eldest sons, rather than dividing it up among all sons. By 1304, [[Yury of Moscow]] contested with [[Mikhail of Tver]] for the throne of the principality of [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]]. [[Ivan I of Russia|Ivan I]] eventually defeated [[Mikhail of Tver|Tver]] to become the sole collector of taxes for the [[Mongol]] rulers, making Moscow the capital of [[Vladimir-Suzdal]]. By paying high tribute, Ivan won an important concession from the [[Khan (title)|Khan]].\n\nWhile Khan of the [[Golden Horde]] initially attempted to limit Moscow's influence, when the growth of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] began to threaten all of Russia, the Khan strengthened Moscow to counterbalance Lithuania, allowing it to become one of the most powerful cities in Russia. In 1380, prince [[Dmitry Donskoy]] of Moscow led a united Russian army to an important victory over the Mongols in the [[Battle of Kulikovo]]. Afterwards, Moscow took the leading role in liberating Russia from Mongol domination. In 1480, [[Ivan III of Russia|Ivan III]] had [[Great standing on the Ugra river|finally broken the Russians free]] from Tatar control, and Moscow became the capital of an empire that would eventually encompass all of Russia and [[Siberia]], and parts of many other lands.\n[[File:Ivan III of Russia.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Ivan III]]\nIn 1462 [[Ivan III of Russia|Ivan III, known as Ivan the Great]] (1440\u20131505) became Grand Prince of Moscow (then part of the medieval Muscovy state). He began fighting the Tatars, enlarged the territory of [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Muscovy]], and enriched his capital city. By 1500 it had a population of 100,000 and was one of the largest  cities in the world. He conquered the far larger principality of Novgorod to the north, which had been allied to the hostile Lithuanians. By this conquest [[Ivan III of Russia|Ivan III]] enlarged his territory seven-fold, expanding from 430,000 to 2,800,000 square kilometers. He took control of the ancient \"[[Novgorod Chronicle]]\" and made it a propaganda vehicle for his regime.<ref>J. L. I. Fennell, ''Ivan the Great of Moscow'' (1961) p 354</ref><ref>Sergei M. Soloviev,  and John J. Windhausen, eds. ''History of Russia. Vol. 8: Russian Society in the Age of Ivan III'' (1979)</ref>\n\nThe original [[Moscow Kremlin]] was built during the 14th century. It was reconstructed by Ivan, who in the 1480s invited architects from [[Renaissance Italy|Italy]], such as [[Petrus Antonius Solarius]], who designed the new Kremlin wall and its towers, and [[Marco Ruffo]] who designed the new palace for the prince. The Kremlin walls as they now appear are those designed by Solarius, completed in 1495. The Kremlin's  Great Bell Tower was built in 1505\u201308 and augmented to its present height in 1600.\n\nA trading settlement, or ''posad'', grew up to the east of the Kremlin, in the area known as ''Zaradye'' (\u0417\u0430\u0440\u044f\u0434\u044c\u0435). In the time of Ivan III, the [[Red Square]], originally named the Hollow Field (\u041f\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0435) appeared.\n\nIn 1508\u20131516, the Italian architect [[Aloisio the New|Aleviz Fryazin (Novy)]] arranged for the construction of a moat in front of the eastern wall, which would connect the [[Moskva River|Moskva]] and [[Neglinnaya River|Neglinnaya]] and be filled in with water from Neglinnaya. This moat, known as the [[Alevizov moat]] and having a length of 541 meters, width of 36 meters, and a depth of 9.5\u201313&nbsp;m was lined with limestone and, in 1533, fenced on both sides with low, 4-meter thick cogged brick walls.\n\n{{anchor|Tsardom}}\n\n==Tsardom (1547\u20131721)==\n{{further|Russian Tsardom}}\n[[File:\u0420\u0430\u0441\u0446\u0432\u0435\u0442 \u041a\u0440\u0435\u043c\u043b\u044f. \u0412\u0441\u0435\u0445\u0441\u0432\u044f\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043c\u043e\u0441\u0442 \u0438 \u041a\u0440\u0435\u043c\u043b\u044c \u0432 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0446\u0435 XVII \u0432\u0435\u043a\u0430. 1922, \u0431\u0443\u043c\u0430\u0433\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043e\u043d\u0435, \u0443\u0433\u043e\u043b\u044c, \u0430\u043a\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0435\u043b\u044c, \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0448.jpg|thumb|View of 17th-century Moscow (1922 drawing by [[Apollinary Vasnetsov]])]]\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries, the three circular defenses were built: [[Kitay-gorod]] (\u041a\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0439-\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434), the White City (\u0411\u0435\u043b\u044b\u0439 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434) and the Earthen City (\u0417\u0435\u043c\u043b\u044f\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434). However, in 1547, two fires destroyed much of the town, and in 1571 the [[Crimean Tatars]] captured Moscow, burning everything except the Kremlin.  The annals record that only 30,000 of 200,000 inhabitants survived.\n\nThe Crimean Tatars attacked again in 1591, but this time were held back by new defense walls, built between 1584 and 1591 by a craftsman named [[Fyodor Kon]]. In 1592, an outer earth rampart with 50 towers was erected around the city, including an area on the right bank of the Moscow River. As an outermost line of defense, a chain of strongly fortified monasteries was established beyond the ramparts to the south and east, principally the [[Novodevichy Convent]] and [[Donskoy Monastery|Donskoy]], [[Danilov Monastery|Danilov]], [[Simonov Monastery|Simonov]], [[Novospassky Monastery|Novospasskiy]], and [[Andronikov Monastery|Andronikov]] monasteries, most of which now house museums. From its ramparts, the city became poetically known as ''Bielokamennaya'', the \"White-Walled\". The limits of the city as marked by the ramparts built in 1592 are now marked by the [[Garden Ring]].\n\n[[File:St Basils Cathedral-500px.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Saint Basil's Cathedral]]\nThree square gates existed on the eastern side of the Kremlin wall, which in the 17th century, were known as: Konstantino-Eleninsky, Spassky, Nikolsky (owing their names to the icons of Constantine and Helen, the Savior and St. Nicholas which hung over them). The last two were directly opposite the Red Square, while the Konstantino-Elenensky gate was located behind Saint Basil's Cathedral.\n\nThe [[Russian famine of 1601\u20131603]] killed perhaps 100,000 in Moscow. From 1610 through 1612, troops of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] occupied Moscow, as its ruler [[Sigismund III Vasa|Sigismund III]] tried to take the Russian throne. In 1612, the people of [[Nizhny Novgorod]] and other Russian cities conducted by prince [[Dmitry Pozharsky]] and [[Kuzma Minin]] rose against the Lithuanians occupants, [[Time of Troubles|besieged the Kremlin, and expelled them]]. In 1613, the [[Zemsky sobor]] elected [[Michael I of Russia|Michael Romanov]] tsar, establishing the [[Romanov dynasty]].\n\nDuring the first half of the 17th century, the population of Moscow doubled from roughly 100,000 to 200,000. It expanded beyond its ramparts in the later 17th century. By 1682, there were 692 households established north of the ramparts, by [[Ukrainians]] and [[Belarusians]] abducted from their hometowns in the course of [[Russo-Polish War (1654\u20131667)]]. These new outskirts of the city came to be known as the ''Meshchanskaya [[sloboda]]'', after Ruthenian ''meshchane'' \"town people\". The term ''meshchane'' (\u043c\u0435\u0449\u0430\u043d\u0435) acquired pejorative connotations in 18th-century Russia and today means \"petty bourgeois\" or \"narrow-minded philistine\".<ref>\u041f.\u0412.\u0421\u044b\u0442\u0438\u043d, \"\u0418\u0437 \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0438 \u043c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0443\u043b\u0438\u0446\", \u041c, 1948, p. 296.</ref>\n\nThe entire city of the late 17th century, including the [[sloboda]]s which grew up outside of the city ramparts, are contained within what is today Moscow's [[Central Administrative Okrug]].\n\nNumerous disasters befell the city. The plague killed upwards of 80% of the people in 1654\u201355.  Fires burned out much of the wooden city in 1626 and 1648.<ref>M.S.

But after 1750, the population grew more than tenfold over the remaining duration of the Russian Empire, reaching 1.8 million by 1915.\n\n[[File:Kniznije lavki.jpg|thumb|Book shops at the Spassky bridge. By [[Apollinary Vasnetsov]]]]\nBy 1700, the building of cobbled roads had begun. In November 1730, the permanent street light was introduced, and by 1867 many streets had a gaslight. In 1883, near the [[Prechistinskiye Gates]], arc lamps were installed. In 1741 Moscow was surrounded by a barricade 25 miles long, the [[Kamer-Kollezhskiy barrier]], with 16 gates at which customs tolls were collected. Its line is traced today by a number of streets called ''val'' (\u201cramparts\u201d).\nBetween 1781\u20131804 the [[Mytischinskiy water-pipe]] (the first in Russia) was built. In 1813 a Commission for the Construction of the City of Moscow was established. It launched a great program of rebuilding, including a partial replanning of the city-center. Among many buildings constructed or reconstructed at this time were the [[Grand Kremlin Palace]] and the [[Kremlin Armoury]], the [[Moscow University]], the [[Moscow Manege]] (Riding School), and the [[Bolshoi Theatre]]. In 1903 the [[Moskvoretskaya water-supply]] was completed.\nIn the early 19th century, the Arch of Konstantino-Elenensky gate was paved with bricks, but the Spassky Gate was the main front gate of the Kremlin and used for royal entrances. From this gate, wooden and (following the 17th-century improvements) stone bridges stretched across the moat. Books were sold on this bridge and stone platforms were built nearby for guns - \"raskats\". The [[Tsar Cannon]] was located on the platform of the [[Lobnoye mesto]].\n\nThe road connecting Moscow with St. Petersburg, now the [[M10 highway (Russia)|M10 highway]],  was completed in 1746, its Moscow end following the old [[Tver]] road which had existed since the 16th century. It became known as  ''[[Leningradsky Prospekt|Peterburskoye Schosse]]'' after it was paved in the 1780s. [[Petrovsky Palace]] was built in 1776\u20131780 by [[Matvey Kazakov]] as a railway station specifically reserved for royal journeys from Saint Petersburg to Moscow, while coaches for lesser classes arrived and departed from [[Vsekhsvyatskoye]] station.\n\nWhen [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] [[Napoleon's invasion of Russia|invaded]] Russia in 1812, the Moscovites were evacuated. It is suspected today that the [[Fire of Moscow (1812)|Moscow fire]] which ensued initially started as a result of Russian sabotage.<ref name=Hecker>{{cite magazine|title=Schaurig-grandioses Schauspiel |trans-title=A horrific and terrific spectacle |language=German |first=Hans |last=Hecker |work=[[Damals]] |year=2012 |volume=44 |issue=9  |pages=72\u201377}}</ref> In the fire's wake, an estimated three-quarters of the city lay in ruin.\n\n[[File:Chumbunt.png|thumb|left|210px|[[Moscow plague riot of 1771]]]]\n[[Moscow State University]] was established in 1755. Its main building was reconstructed after the 1812 fire by [[Domenico Giliardi]]. The ''[[Moskovskiye Vedomosti]]'' newspaper appeared from 1756, originally in weekly intervals, and from 1859 as a daily newspaper.\n\nThe [[Arbat Street]] had been in existence since at least the 15th century, but it was developed into a prestigious area during the 18th century. It was destroyed in the fire of 1812 and was rebuilt completely in the early 19th century.\n\n[[File:Pozhar Moskvy v 1812.jpg|thumb|French troops in Moscow in 1812]]\nIn the 1830s, general [[Alexander Bashilov]] planned the first regular grid of city streets north from Petrovsky Palace.  [[Khodynka Field|Khodynka]] field south of the highway was used for military training.\nSmolensky Rail station (forerunner of present-day [[Belorussky Rail Terminal]]) was inaugurated in 1870.\n[[Sokolniki Park]], in the 18th century the home of the tsar's falconers well outside of Moscow, became contiguous with the expanding city in the later 19th century and was developed into a public municipal park in 1878. The suburban [[Savyolovsky Rail Terminal]] was built in 1902.\n\n[[File:The Russian road to China (1910) (14735761346).jpg|thumb|left|Moscow 1910]]\nIn January 1905, the institution of the City Governor, or [[Mayor]], was officially introduced in Moscow, and [[Alexander Adrianov]] became Moscow's first official mayor.\n\nWhen Catherine II came to power in 1762, the city's  filth and smell of sewage  was depicted by observers as a symptom of disorderly life styles of lower-class Russians recently arrived from the farms. Elites called for improving sanitation, which became part of Catherine's plans for increasing control over social life. National political and military successes from 1812 through 1855 calmed the critics and validated efforts to produce a more enlightened and stable society. There was less talk about the smell and the poor conditions of public health. However, in the wake of Russia's failures in the Crimean War in 1855\u201356, confidence in the ability of the state to maintain order in the slums eroded, and demands for improved public health put filth back on the agenda.<ref>Alexander M.

The inscription reads: \"glory to you, invincible Moscow, beauty and pride of the Russian people\".]]\nIn the beginning of the 20th century, several strikes and armed risings in Moscow paved the way to the [[October Revolution]]. In 1918 the [[Bolsheviks]] moved the seat of government from [[Saint Petersburg]] back to Moscow.\n\nDuring the [[Great Patriotic War]], the [[USSR|Soviet]] State Committee of Defense and the General Staff of the [[Red Army]] were located in Moscow. In 1941, 16 divisions  of the national volunteers (more than 160,000 people), 25 battalions (18,000 people) and 4 engineering regiments were formed among the Muscovites. On 6 December 1941, German [[Army Group Centre]] was stopped at the outskirts of the city and then driven off in the course of the [[Battle of Moscow]]. Many factories were evacuated, together with much of the government, and from October 20 the city was declared to be in a state of siege. Its remaining inhabitants built and manned antitank defenses, while the city was bombarded from the air. On May 1, 1944 a medal \"For the defense of Moscow\" and in 1947 another medal \"In memory of the 800th anniversary of Moscow\" were instituted.\n\nDuring the postwar years, there was a serious housing crisis, solved by the invention of [[Tower block|high-rise apartments]]. There are about 13,000 {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} of these standardized and prefabricated apartment block, housing the majority of Moscow's population.  Apartments were built and partly furnished in the factory before being raised and stacked into tall columns. The popular Soviet-era comic film ''[[Irony of Fate]]'' parodies this construction method.\n\nThe city of [[Zelenograd]] was built in 1958 at 37&nbsp;km from the city center to the north-west, along the [[Leningradskoye Shosse]], and incorporated as one of Moscow's [[Administrative divisions of Moscow|administrative ogrkugs]]. [[Moscow State University]] moved to its campus on [[Sparrow Hills]] in 1953.\n\nOn May 8, 1965 due to the actual 20th [[Victory Day (9 May)|anniversary of the victory]] in [[World War II]] Moscow was awarded a title of the [[Hero City]]. In 1980 it hosted the [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympic Games]].\n\nThe [[MKAD]] ring road was opened in 1961. It had four lanes running 109&nbsp;km along the city borders.\nThe MKAD marked the administrative boundaries of the city of Moscow until the 1980s, when outlying suburbs beyond the ring road began to be incorporated.\n\nIn 1991 Moscow was the scene of a [[Soviet coup attempt of 1991|coup attempt]] by conservators opposed to the [[Perestroika|liberal reforms]] of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]].\n\n===Metro===\nThe [[Moscow Metro]] opened in 1935 and immediately became the centerpiece of the transportation system. More than that it was a Stalinist device to awe and control the populace, and give them an appreciation of Soviet realist art. It became the prototype for future Soviet large-scale technologies. [[Lazar Kaganovich]] was in charge; he designed the subway so that citizens would absorb the values and ethos of Stalinist civilization as they rode. The artwork of the 13 original stations became nationally and internationally famous. For example, the Sverdlov Square subway station featured porcelain bas-reliefs depicting the daily life of the Soviet peoples, and the bas-reliefs at the Dynamo Stadium sports complex glorified sports and the physical prowess of the powerful new \"Homo Sovieticus.\" (Soviet man).<ref>Isabel W\u00fcnsche, \"Homo Sovieticus: The Athletic Motif in the Design of the Dynamo Metro Station,\" ''Studies in the Decorative Arts'' (2000) 7#2 pp 65-90</ref>  The metro was touted as the symbol of the new social order\u2014a sort of Communist cathedral of engineering modernity.<ref>Andrew Jenks, \"A Metro on the Mount,\" ''Technology & Culture'' (2000) 41#4 pp 697-723p</ref>  Soviet workers did the labor and the art work, but the main engineering designs, routes, and construction plans were handled by specialists recruited from the London Underground.

Since then a market economy has emerged in Moscow, producing an explosion of Western-style retailing, services, architecture, and lifestyles.\n\nEven with Russia's population shrinking by 6 million after the fall of the USSR, Moscow has continued to grow during the 1990s to 2000s, its population rising from below nine to above ten million. Mason and Nigmatullina argue that Soviet-era urban-growth controls (before 1991) produced controlled and sustainable metropolitan development, typified by the greenbelt built in 1935. Since then however, there has been a dramatic growth of low-density suburban sprawl, created by a heavy demand for single-family dwellings as opposed to crowded apartments. In 1995\u20131997 the MKAD ring road was widened from the initial four to ten lanes. In December 2002 [[Bulvar Dmitriya Donskogo]] became the first Moscow Metro station that opened beyond the limits of MKAD. The [[Third Ring Road (Moscow)|Third Ring Road]], intermediate between the early 19th-century [[Garden Ring]] and the Soviet era outer ring road, was completed in 2004. The greenbelt is becoming more and more fragmented, and satellite cities are appearing at the fringe. Summer dachas are being converted into year-round residences, and with the proliferation of automobiles there is heavy  traffic congestion.<ref>Robert J.

It was the capital of the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] (or Muscovy), from 1340 to 1547 and in 1713 renamed as the  [[Tsardom of Russia]] by Peter I \"the Great\" (when the capital was moved to [[Saint Petersburg]]). Moscow was the capital of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] from 1918, which then became the [[Soviet Union]] (1922 to 1991), and since 1991 has served as capital of the [[Russian Federation]].\n\nSituated on either bank of the eponymous [[Moskva River]], the city during the 16th to 17th centuries grew up in five concentric divisions, formerly separated from one another by walls: the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]] (\"fortress\"), [[Kitaigorod]] (\"walled town\", but interpreted as \"Chinatown\" by [[folk etymology]]), [[Bielygorod]] (\"white town\"), [[Zemlianoigorod]] (\"earthworks town\"), and [[Miestchanskygorod]] (\"bourgeois town\") outside the city walls.\n\nAfter the [[Fire of Moscow (1812)|fire of 1812]], the city ramparts were replaced with the [[Boulevard Ring]] and [[Garden Ring]] roads, replacing the walls around Bielygorod and Zemlianoigorod, respectively. The city's population grew from 250,000 to over a million in the 19th century, and from one to ten million in the 20th century, putting it among the top twenty of the [[World's largest cities|world's most populous cities]] today.\n\n==Prehistory==\nThe oldest evidence of humans on the territory of Moscow dates from the [[Neolithic]] (Schukinskaya site on the [[Moscow River]]). Within the modern bounds of the city other late evidence was discovered (the burial ground of the [[Fatyanovo\u2013Balanovo culture|Fatyanovskaya culture]], the site of the [[Iron Age]] settlement of the [[Dyakovo culture]]), on the territory of the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]], [[Sparrow Hills]], [[Setun River]] and Kuntsevskiy forest park, etc.\n\nThe etymology of the name ''Moskva'' is [[Uralic languages|Uralic]], perhaps [[Volga-Finnic languages|Volga-Finnic]] ([[Mordvinic]] or [[Merya]]{{Clarify|date=April 2011}})).\n\nIn the 9th century, the [[Oka River]] was part of the [[Volga trade route]], and the upper Volga watershed became an area of contact between the indigenous Uralic peoples such as the [[Merya]] and the expanding [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] ([[Volga Bulgars]]), [[Germanic people|Germanic]] ([[Varangians]]) and [[early Slavs|Slavic]] peoples.\n\nThe earliest [[early East Slavs|East Slavic]] tribes recorded as having expanded to the upper Volga in the 9th to 10th centuries are the [[Vyatichi]] and [[Krivichi]].\nThe Moskva River was incorporated as part of [[Rostov-Suzdal]] into the [[Kievan Rus]] in the 11th century. By AD 1100, a minor settlement had appeared on the mouth of the [[Neglinnaya River]].\n\n==Early history (1147\u20131283)==\n{{further|Kievan Rus|Vladimir-Suzdal}}\nThe first reference to Moscow dates from 1147 as a meeting place of [[Yuri Dolgorukiy]] and [[Sviatoslav Olgovich]]. At the time it was a minor town on the western border of Vladimir-Suzdal Principality.\n\nIn 1156, [[Kniaz]] [[Yury Dolgoruky]] fortified the town with a timber fence and a moat. In the course of the [[Mongol invasion of Rus]],  the [[Golden Horde]] burned the city to the ground and killed its inhabitants.\n\nThe timber fort ''na Moskv\u011b'' \"on the Moscow river\" was inherited by [[Daniel of Moscow|Daniel]], the youngest son of [[Alexander Nevsky]], in the 1260s, at the time considered the least valuable of his father's possessions.\nDaniel was still a child at the time, and the fort was governed by ''tiuns'' (deputies), appointed by Daniel's paternal uncle, [[Yaroslav of Tver]].\n\nDaniel came of age in the 1270s and became involved in the power struggles of the principality with lasting success, siding with his brother [[Dmitry of Pereslavl|Dmitry]] in his bid for the rule of Novgorod. From 1283 he acted as the ruler of an independent principality alongside Dmitry, who became Grand Duke of Vladimir.\nDaniel has been credited with founding the first Moscow monasteries, dedicated to the Lord's Epiphany and to Saint Daniel.\n\n==Grand Duchy (1283\u20131547)==\n{{Main|Grand Duchy of Moscow}}\nDaniel ruled Moscow as Grand Duke until 1303 and established it as a prosperous city which would eventually eclipse its parent principality of Vladimir by the 1320s.\n\nIn 1282 Daniel founded the first monastery of Moscow on the right bank of the [[Moskva River]], the wooden church of St. Daniel-Stylite. It is now known as the [[Danilov Monastery]]. Daniel died in 1303, at the age of 42. Before his death he became a monk and, according to his will, was buried in the cemetery of the St. Daniel Monastery.\n\nMoscow was stable and prosperous for many years and attracted a large numbers of refugees from across Russia. The Rurikids maintained large landholdings by practicing [[primogeniture]], whereby all land was passed to the eldest sons, rather than dividing it up among all sons. By 1304, [[Yury of Moscow]] contested with [[Mikhail of Tver]] for the throne of the principality of [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]]. [[Ivan I of Russia|Ivan I]] eventually defeated [[Mikhail of Tver|Tver]] to become the sole collector of taxes for the [[Mongol]] rulers, making Moscow the capital of [[Vladimir-Suzdal]]. By paying high tribute, Ivan won an important concession from the [[Khan (title)|Khan]].\n\nWhile Khan of the [[Golden Horde]] initially attempted to limit Moscow's influence, when the growth of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] began to threaten all of Russia, the Khan strengthened Moscow to counterbalance Lithuania, allowing it to become one of the most powerful cities in Russia. In 1380, prince [[Dmitry Donskoy]] of Moscow led a united Russian army to an important victory over the Mongols in the [[Battle of Kulikovo]]. Afterwards, Moscow took the leading role in liberating Russia from Mongol domination. In 1480, [[Ivan III of Russia|Ivan III]] had [[Great standing on the Ugra river|finally broken the Russians free]] from Tatar control, and Moscow became the capital of an empire that would eventually encompass all of Russia and [[Siberia]], and parts of many other lands.\n[[File:Ivan III of Russia.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Ivan III]]\nIn 1462 [[Ivan III of Russia|Ivan III, known as Ivan the Great]] (1440\u20131505) became Grand Prince of Moscow (then part of the medieval Muscovy state). He began fighting the Tatars, enlarged the territory of [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Muscovy]], and enriched his capital city. By 1500 it had a population of 100,000 and was one of the largest  cities in the world. He conquered the far larger principality of Novgorod to the north, which had been allied to the hostile Lithuanians. By this conquest [[Ivan III of Russia|Ivan III]] enlarged his territory seven-fold, expanding from 430,000 to 2,800,000 square kilometers. He took control of the ancient \"[[Novgorod Chronicle]]\" and made it a propaganda vehicle for his regime.<ref>J. L. I. Fennell, ''Ivan the Great of Moscow'' (1961) p 354</ref><ref>Sergei M. Soloviev,  and John J. Windhausen, eds. ''History of Russia. Vol. 8: Russian Society in the Age of Ivan III'' (1979)</ref>\n\nThe original [[Moscow Kremlin]] was built during the 14th century. It was reconstructed by Ivan, who in the 1480s invited architects from [[Renaissance Italy|Italy]], such as [[Petrus Antonius Solarius]], who designed the new Kremlin wall and its towers, and [[Marco Ruffo]] who designed the new palace for the prince. The Kremlin walls as they now appear are those designed by Solarius, completed in 1495. The Kremlin's  Great Bell Tower was built in 1505\u201308 and augmented to its present height in 1600.\n\nA trading settlement, or ''posad'', grew up to the east of the Kremlin, in the area known as ''Zaradye'' (\u0417\u0430\u0440\u044f\u0434\u044c\u0435). In the time of Ivan III, the [[Red Square]], originally named the Hollow Field (\u041f\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0435) appeared.\n\nIn 1508\u20131516, the Italian architect [[Aloisio the New|Aleviz Fryazin (Novy)]] arranged for the construction of a moat in front of the eastern wall, which would connect the [[Moskva River|Moskva]] and [[Neglinnaya River|Neglinnaya]] and be filled in with water from Neglinnaya. This moat, known as the [[Alevizov moat]] and having a length of 541 meters, width of 36 meters, and a depth of 9.5\u201313&nbsp;m was lined with limestone and, in 1533, fenced on both sides with low, 4-meter thick cogged brick walls.\n\n{{anchor|Tsardom}}\n\n==Tsardom (1547\u20131721)==\n{{further|Russian Tsardom}}\n[[File:\u0420\u0430\u0441\u0446\u0432\u0435\u0442 \u041a\u0440\u0435\u043c\u043b\u044f. \u0412\u0441\u0435\u0445\u0441\u0432\u044f\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043c\u043e\u0441\u0442 \u0438 \u041a\u0440\u0435\u043c\u043b\u044c \u0432 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0446\u0435 XVII \u0432\u0435\u043a\u0430. 1922, \u0431\u0443\u043c\u0430\u0433\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043e\u043d\u0435, \u0443\u0433\u043e\u043b\u044c, \u0430\u043a\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0435\u043b\u044c, \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0448.jpg|thumb|View of 17th-century Moscow (1922 drawing by [[Apollinary Vasnetsov]])]]\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries, the three circular defenses were built: [[Kitay-gorod]] (\u041a\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0439-\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434), the White City (\u0411\u0435\u043b\u044b\u0439 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434) and the Earthen City (\u0417\u0435\u043c\u043b\u044f\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434). However, in 1547, two fires destroyed much of the town, and in 1571 the [[Crimean Tatars]] captured Moscow, burning everything except the Kremlin.  The annals record that only 30,000 of 200,000 inhabitants survived.\n\nThe Crimean Tatars attacked again in 1591, but this time were held back by new defense walls, built between 1584 and 1591 by a craftsman named [[Fyodor Kon]]. In 1592, an outer earth rampart with 50 towers was erected around the city, including an area on the right bank of the Moscow River. As an outermost line of defense, a chain of strongly fortified monasteries was established beyond the ramparts to the south and east, principally the [[Novodevichy Convent]] and [[Donskoy Monastery|Donskoy]], [[Danilov Monastery|Danilov]], [[Simonov Monastery|Simonov]], [[Novospassky Monastery|Novospasskiy]], and [[Andronikov Monastery|Andronikov]] monasteries, most of which now house museums. From its ramparts, the city became poetically known as ''Bielokamennaya'', the \"White-Walled\". The limits of the city as marked by the ramparts built in 1592 are now marked by the [[Garden Ring]].\n\n[[File:St Basils Cathedral-500px.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Saint Basil's Cathedral]]\nThree square gates existed on the eastern side of the Kremlin wall, which in the 17th century, were known as: Konstantino-Eleninsky, Spassky, Nikolsky (owing their names to the icons of Constantine and Helen, the Savior and St. Nicholas which hung over them). The last two were directly opposite the Red Square, while the Konstantino-Elenensky gate was located behind Saint Basil's Cathedral.\n\nThe [[Russian famine of 1601\u20131603]] killed perhaps 100,000 in Moscow. From 1610 through 1612, troops of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] occupied Moscow, as its ruler [[Sigismund III Vasa|Sigismund III]] tried to take the Russian throne. In 1612, the people of [[Nizhny Novgorod]] and other Russian cities conducted by prince [[Dmitry Pozharsky]] and [[Kuzma Minin]] rose against the Lithuanians occupants, [[Time of Troubles|besieged the Kremlin, and expelled them]]. In 1613, the [[Zemsky sobor]] elected [[Michael I of Russia|Michael Romanov]] tsar, establishing the [[Romanov dynasty]].\n\nDuring the first half of the 17th century, the population of Moscow doubled from roughly 100,000 to 200,000. It expanded beyond its ramparts in the later 17th century. By 1682, there were 692 households established north of the ramparts, by [[Ukrainians]] and [[Belarusians]] abducted from their hometowns in the course of [[Russo-Polish War (1654\u20131667)]]. These new outskirts of the city came to be known as the ''Meshchanskaya [[sloboda]]'', after Ruthenian ''meshchane'' \"town people\". The term ''meshchane'' (\u043c\u0435\u0449\u0430\u043d\u0435) acquired pejorative connotations in 18th-century Russia and today means \"petty bourgeois\" or \"narrow-minded philistine\".<ref>\u041f.\u0412.\u0421\u044b\u0442\u0438\u043d, \"\u0418\u0437 \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0438 \u043c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0443\u043b\u0438\u0446\", \u041c, 1948, p. 296.</ref>\n\nThe entire city of the late 17th century, including the [[sloboda]]s which grew up outside of the city ramparts, are contained within what is today Moscow's [[Central Administrative Okrug]].\n\nNumerous disasters befell the city. The plague killed upwards of 80% of the people in 1654\u201355.  Fires burned out much of the wooden city in 1626 and 1648.<ref>M.S. Anderson, ''Peter the Great'' (1978) p 13</ref>\n\n==Empire (1721\u20131917)==\n{{Main|Moscow Governorate}}\n{{further|Russian Empire}}\n[[File:Coat of Arms of Moscow gubernia (Russian empire).png|thumb|125px|The coat of arms of [[Moscow Governorate]].]]\n[[File:Moskva riverfront.jpg|thumb|left|265px|Moskva riverside in the 19th century.]]\nMoscow ceased to be Russia's capital (except for a brief period from 1728 to 1732 under the influence of the [[Supreme Privy Council]]) when [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] moved his government to the newly built [[Saint Petersburg]] on the Baltic coast in 1712.\n\nAfter losing the status as capital of the empire, the population of Moscow at first decreased, from 200,000 in the 17th century to 130,000 in 1750. But after 1750, the population grew more than tenfold over the remaining duration of the Russian Empire, reaching 1.8 million by 1915.\n\n[[File:Kniznije lavki.jpg|thumb|Book shops at the Spassky bridge. By [[Apollinary Vasnetsov]]]]\nBy 1700, the building of cobbled roads had begun. In November 1730, the permanent street light was introduced, and by 1867 many streets had a gaslight. In 1883, near the [[Prechistinskiye Gates]], arc lamps were installed. In 1741 Moscow was surrounded by a barricade 25 miles long, the [[Kamer-Kollezhskiy barrier]], with 16 gates at which customs tolls were collected. Its line is traced today by a number of streets called ''val'' (\u201cramparts\u201d).\nBetween 1781\u20131804 the [[Mytischinskiy water-pipe]] (the first in Russia) was built. In 1813 a Commission for the Construction of the City of Moscow was established. It launched a great program of rebuilding, including a partial replanning of the city-center. Among many buildings constructed or reconstructed at this time were the [[Grand Kremlin Palace]] and the [[Kremlin Armoury]], the [[Moscow University]], the [[Moscow Manege]] (Riding School), and the [[Bolshoi Theatre]]. In 1903 the [[Moskvoretskaya water-supply]] was completed.\nIn the early 19th century, the Arch of Konstantino-Elenensky gate was paved with bricks, but the Spassky Gate was the main front gate of the Kremlin and used for royal entrances. From this gate, wooden and (following the 17th-century improvements) stone bridges stretched across the moat. Books were sold on this bridge and stone platforms were built nearby for guns - \"raskats\". The [[Tsar Cannon]] was located on the platform of the [[Lobnoye mesto]].\n\nThe road connecting Moscow with St. Petersburg, now the [[M10 highway (Russia)|M10 highway]],  was completed in 1746, its Moscow end following the old [[Tver]] road which had existed since the 16th century.

Elites called for improving sanitation, which became part of Catherine's plans for increasing control over social life. National political and military successes from 1812 through 1855 calmed the critics and validated efforts to produce a more enlightened and stable society. There was less talk about the smell and the poor conditions of public health. However, in the wake of Russia's failures in the Crimean War in 1855\u201356, confidence in the ability of the state to maintain order in the slums eroded, and demands for improved public health put filth back on the agenda.<ref>Alexander M.

The inscription reads: \"glory to you, invincible Moscow, beauty and pride of the Russian people\".]]\nIn the beginning of the 20th century, several strikes and armed risings in Moscow paved the way to the [[October Revolution]]. In 1918 the [[Bolsheviks]] moved the seat of government from [[Saint Petersburg]] back to Moscow.\n\nDuring the [[Great Patriotic War]], the [[USSR|Soviet]] State Committee of Defense and the General Staff of the [[Red Army]] were located in Moscow. In 1941, 16 divisions  of the national volunteers (more than 160,000 people), 25 battalions (18,000 people) and 4 engineering regiments were formed among the Muscovites. On 6 December 1941, German [[Army Group Centre]] was stopped at the outskirts of the city and then driven off in the course of the [[Battle of Moscow]]. Many factories were evacuated, together with much of the government, and from October 20 the city was declared to be in a state of siege. Its remaining inhabitants built and manned antitank defenses, while the city was bombarded from the air. On May 1, 1944 a medal \"For the defense of Moscow\" and in 1947 another medal \"In memory of the 800th anniversary of Moscow\" were instituted.\n\nDuring the postwar years, there was a serious housing crisis, solved by the invention of [[Tower block|high-rise apartments]]. There are about 13,000 {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} of these standardized and prefabricated apartment block, housing the majority of Moscow's population.  Apartments were built and partly furnished in the factory before being raised and stacked into tall columns. The popular Soviet-era comic film ''[[Irony of Fate]]'' parodies this construction method.\n\nThe city of [[Zelenograd]] was built in 1958 at 37&nbsp;km from the city center to the north-west, along the [[Leningradskoye Shosse]], and incorporated as one of Moscow's [[Administrative divisions of Moscow|administrative ogrkugs]]. [[Moscow State University]] moved to its campus on [[Sparrow Hills]] in 1953.\n\nOn May 8, 1965 due to the actual 20th [[Victory Day (9 May)|anniversary of the victory]] in [[World War II]] Moscow was awarded a title of the [[Hero City]]. In 1980 it hosted the [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympic Games]].\n\nThe [[MKAD]] ring road was opened in 1961. It had four lanes running 109&nbsp;km along the city borders.\nThe MKAD marked the administrative boundaries of the city of Moscow until the 1980s, when outlying suburbs beyond the ring road began to be incorporated.\n\nIn 1991 Moscow was the scene of a [[Soviet coup attempt of 1991|coup attempt]] by conservators opposed to the [[Perestroika|liberal reforms]] of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]].\n\n===Metro===\nThe [[Moscow Metro]] opened in 1935 and immediately became the centerpiece of the transportation system. More than that it was a Stalinist device to awe and control the populace, and give them an appreciation of Soviet realist art. It became the prototype for future Soviet large-scale technologies. [[Lazar Kaganovich]] was in charge; he designed the subway so that citizens would absorb the values and ethos of Stalinist civilization as they rode. The artwork of the 13 original stations became nationally and internationally famous. For example, the Sverdlov Square subway station featured porcelain bas-reliefs depicting the daily life of the Soviet peoples, and the bas-reliefs at the Dynamo Stadium sports complex glorified sports and the physical prowess of the powerful new \"Homo Sovieticus.\" (Soviet man).<ref>Isabel W\u00fcnsche, \"Homo Sovieticus: The Athletic Motif in the Design of the Dynamo Metro Station,\" ''Studies in the Decorative Arts'' (2000) 7#2 pp 65-90</ref>  The metro was touted as the symbol of the new social order\u2014a sort of Communist cathedral of engineering modernity.<ref>Andrew Jenks, \"A Metro on the Mount,\" ''Technology & Culture'' (2000) 41#4 pp 697-723p</ref>  Soviet workers did the labor and the art work, but the main engineering designs, routes, and construction plans were handled by specialists recruited from the London Underground.  The Britons called for tunneling instead of the \"cut-and-cover\" technique, the use of escalators instead of lifts, and designed the routes and the rolling stock.<ref>Michael Robbins, \"London Underground and Moscow Metro,\" ''Journal of Transport History,'' (1997) 18#1 pp 45-53.</ref>  The paranoia of Stalin and the NKVD was evident when the secret police arrested numerous British engineers for espionage\u2014that is for gaining an in-depth knowledge of the city's physical layout.

Morrell, \"Redefining Intelligence and Intelligence-Gathering: The Industrial Intelligence Centre and the Metro-Vickers Affair, Moscow 1933,\" ''Intelligence and National Security'' (1994) 9#3 pp 520-533.</ref>\n\nUntil nowadays Moscow metro is one of the most important heritage of architecture of the USSR period.  The most inspiring [http://www.sputnik8.com/en/activities/279 metro stations] of the Stalin's era are Revolution Square, Kievskaya, Beloruskaya, Mayakovskaya, Novoslobodskaya, Dostoevskaya, Prospekt mira, Komsomolskaya and Taganskaya.\n\n==Recent history (1991 to present)==\nWhen the USSR was dissolved in the same year, Moscow became the capital of the [[Russian Federation]]. Since then a market economy has emerged in Moscow, producing an explosion of Western-style retailing, services, architecture, and lifestyles.\n\nEven with Russia's population shrinking by 6 million after the fall of the USSR, Moscow has continued to grow during the 1990s to 2000s, its population rising from below nine to above ten million. Mason and Nigmatullina argue that Soviet-era urban-growth controls (before 1991) produced controlled and sustainable metropolitan development, typified by the greenbelt built in 1935. Since then however, there has been a dramatic growth of low-density suburban sprawl, created by a heavy demand for single-family dwellings as opposed to crowded apartments. In 1995\u20131997 the MKAD ring road was widened from the initial four to ten lanes. In December 2002 [[Bulvar Dmitriya Donskogo]] became the first Moscow Metro station that opened beyond the limits of MKAD. The [[Third Ring Road (Moscow)|Third Ring Road]], intermediate between the early 19th-century [[Garden Ring]] and the Soviet era outer ring road, was completed in 2004. The greenbelt is becoming more and more fragmented, and satellite cities are appearing at the fringe. Summer dachas are being converted into year-round residences, and with the proliferation of automobiles there is heavy  traffic congestion.<ref>Robert J. Mason and Liliya Nigmatullina, \"Suburbanization and Sustainability in Metropolitan Moscow,\" ''Geographical Review'' (2011) 101#3 pp 316-333.</ref>\n\n==Historical demographics==\n{{refimprove section|date=July 2014}}\n[[File:Population Development Moscow.png|500px|right|thumb|Graphic: population progress]]\nThe city's population is rapidly increasing.

The following year he obtained a post at the ''Darzhavna pechatnitsa'', the official government publisher in [[Sofia]]. In 1932, he joined the BWP proper, later serving as secretary of its Second Borough Committee and as a member of its Sofia County Committee. Although the BWP was banned along with all other political parties after the uprising of [[1934 Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat|19 May 1934]], it continued fielding a handful of non-party National Assembly Deputies and Zhivkov retained his posts at its Sofia structure.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Zhivkov participated in Bulgaria's resistance movement against the country's alignment with [[Nazi Germany]] and was sympathetic to the country's 50,000 Jews.<ref>Bar-Zohar, Michael, ''Beyond Hitler's Grasp: The Heroic Rescue of Bulgaria's Jews''. Adams Media Corp. 1998, p.199</ref> In 1943, he was involved in organising the [[Chavdar (resistance brigade)|Chavdar]] partisan detachment in and around his place of birth, becoming deputy commander of the Sofia operations area in the summer of 1944. Under his rule, many fellow former combatants with Chavdar were to rise to positions of prominence in Bulgarian affairs. He is said to have coordinated partisan movements with those of pro-Soviet army units during the [[1944 Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat|9 September 1944 uprising]].\n\n== Rise to power ==\n[[File:Todor Zhivkov and Georgi Dimitrov.jpg|thumb|Todor Zhivkov and Georgi Dimitrov in a Fatherland Front congress in 1946.]]\nAfter 9 September 1944, Zhivkov became head of the [[Sofia]] police force, restyled as the ''Narodna Militsiya'' (People's Militia). He was elected to the BCP [[Central Committee]] as a candidate member in 1945 and a full member in 1948. In the run-up to the 1949 treason trial against [[Traicho Kostov]], Zhivkov criticised the Party and judicial authorities for what he claimed was their leniency with regard to Kostov. This placed him in the [[Stalinist]] [[hardline]] wing of the Party. In 1950, Zhivkov became a candidate member of the BCP [[Politburo]], then led by [[Vulko Chervenkov]], leading to a full membership in 1951. In the years which followed, he was involved in countering countryside resistance to forced [[collective farming|farm collectivisation]] in northwestern Bulgaria.\n\nAfter [[Joseph Stalin]]'s death, an emphasis on shared leadership emerged. The hardline Stalinist Chervenkov gave up his post as General Secretary of the BCP in 1954. Zhivkov took his place, but Chervenkov retained most of his powers as [[prime minister]]. Bulgarian opinion at the time interpreted this as a self-preservation move by Chervenkov, since Zhivkov was a less well known figure in the party. After [[Nikita Khrushchev]] delivered his famous secret speech against Stalin at the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] 20th Congress, a BCP Central Committee plenary meeting was convened in April 1956 to agree to adopt a new Krushchevite line. At that ''plenum'', Zhivkov criticized Chervenkov as a disciple of Stalin, had him demoted from prime minister to a cabinet post, and promoted former [[Committee for State Security (Bulgaria)|Committee for State Security]] (CSS) head [[Anton Yugov]] to the post of prime minister. It was at this point that he became the ''de facto'' leader of Bulgaria. Subsequently, Zhivkov was associated with the \"April Line,\" which had [[anti-Stalinist]] credentials. At the BCP 8th Congress in late 1962, Zhivkov accused Yugov of anti-Party activity, expelled him from the BCP and had him placed under [[house arrest]].\n\nWith the increasingly strengthening positions of Zhivkov as the country's and Communist party's leader, former [[Partisan (military)|partisan]] leaders and active military took a critical stance on the [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionist]] policies of the communist leadership. In the events described as the \"[[Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat attempt of 1965|April Conspiracy]]\" of 1965 or the \"Plot of Gorunia,\" general [[Ivan Todorov-Gorunia]], general [[Tzviatko Anev]] (''\u0426\u0432\u044f\u0442\u043a\u043e \u0410\u043d\u0435\u0432'') and [[Tzolo \u041arastev]] (''\u0426\u043e\u043b\u043e \u041a\u0440\u044a\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0432'') organized a group of high-ranking military officers planning to overthrow the regime. Their plan was to establish a pro-Chinese leadership in the country. The coup was exposed and between 28 March and 12 April 1965 and most of the plotters were arrested.\n\nAs prime minister, Zhivkov then held both of Bulgaria's leading political and government posts; for nearly all of Bulgaria's existence as an independent nation, the prime minister has been reckoned as the country's leading political figure. Though the post of head of state was traditionally reserved for the leader of the surviving pro-Communist faction of the [[Bulgarian Agrarian National Union]], the \"[[Zhivkov Constitution]]\" adopted by referendum in July 1971 promoted him to chairman of the new State Council. The post, equivalent to that of president, confirmed his position as the country's top leader. Zhivkov remained faithful to Moscow during his 35 years in power, but adopted a more liberal stance than his predecessor by allowing some market reforms (such as allowing surplus agricultural goods to be sold for profit) and ending persecution of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church.\n\n== Policies ==\n=== Economic ===\nIn the mid-1950s, Soviet-style centralized planning produced economic indicators showing that Bulgarians were returning to their prewar lifestyle in some respects: real wages increased 75%, consumption of meat, fruit, and vegetables increased markedly, medical facilities and doctors became available to more of the population, and in 1957 collective farm workers benefited from the first agricultural pension and welfare system in Eastern Europe.<ref name=\"Domestic Policy\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0062) Domestic Policy and Its Results], Library of Congress</ref>\n\nIn 1959 the Communist Party borrowed from the Chinese [[Great Leap Forward]] to symbolize a sudden burst of economic activity to be injected into the Third Five-Year Plan (1958\u20131962), whose original scope was quite conservative. According to the revised plan, industrial production would double and agricultural production would triple by 1962; a new agricultural collectivization and consolidation drive would achieve great economies of scale in that branch; investment in light industry would double, and foreign trade would expand.<ref name=\"Domestic Policy\"/> Following the Chinese model, all of Bulgarian society was to be propagandized and mobilized to meet the planning goals.<ref name=\"Domestic Policy\"/> Two purposes of the grandiose revised plan were to keep Bulgaria in step with the Soviet bloc, all of whose members were embarking on plans for accelerated growth, and to quell internal party conflicts. Amalgamation of collective farms cut their number by 70 percent, after which average farm acreage was second only to the Soviet Union among countries in Eastern Europe.<ref name=\"Plan\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0111) The First Five-Year Plans], Library of Congress</ref> Zhivkov, whose \"theses\" had defined the goals of the plan, purged Politburo members and party rivals [[Boris Taskov]] (in 1959) and [[Anton Yugov]] (in 1962), citing their criticism of his policy as economically obstructionist. Already by 1960, however, Zhivkov had been forced to redefine the impossible goals of his theses.<ref name=\"Domestic Policy\"/> Lack of skilled labor and materials made completion of projects at the prescribed pace impossible. Harvests were disastrously poor in the early 1960s; peasant unrest forced the government to raise food prices; and the urban dissatisfaction that resulted from higher prices compounded a crisis that broke in the summer of 1962. Blame fell on Zhivkov's experiments with decentralized planning, which was totally abandoned by 1963.<ref name=\"Domestic Policy\"/> Despite this, by 1960 the value produced by heavy industry matched that of light industry, and food processing for export grew rapidly.<ref name=\"Plan\"/> Throughout the second phase, budget expenditures consisted primarily of reinvestment in sectors given initial priority. The completion of collectivization in 1958 had shifted 678,000 peasants, about 20 percent of the active labor force, into industrial jobs.<ref name=\"Plan\"/>\n\n[[File:BlockOs-68-Gl 3.JPG|thumb|right|Large-scale industrialization caused many laborers to move from rural to urban areas, which required the construction of numerous pre-fabricated apartment buildings such as this one in Sofia]]\n\nBy the early 1960s, however, changes to the system were obviously needed to achieve sustained growth in all branches of production, including agriculture.<ref name=\"Experimentation\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0111) The Era of Experimentation and Reform], Library of Congress</ref> Specific incentives to reform were shortages of labor and energy and the growing importance of foreign trade in the \"thaw\" years of the mid-1960s. Consequently, in 1962 the Fourth Five-Year Plan began an era of economic reform that brought a series of new approaches to the old goal of [[intensive growth]].<ref name=\"Experimentation\"/> In industry the \"New System of Management\" was introduced in 1964 and lasted until 1968. This approach intended to streamline economic units and make enterprise managers more responsible for performance. In June 1964, about fifty industrial enterprises, mostly producers of [[textiles]] and other consumer goods, were placed under the new system. [[Wage]]s, bonuses, and investment funds were tied to enterprise profits, up to 70% of which could be retained.<ref name=\"Decentralization\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0113) Industrial decentralization], Library of Congress</ref> Outside investment funds were to come primarily from [[bank credit]] rather than the [[state budget]]. In 1965 state subsidies still accounted for 63% of enterprise investment funds, however, while 30% came from retained enterprise earnings and only 7% from bank credits.<ref name=\"Decentralization\"/> By 1970 budget subsidies accounted for only 27% of investment funds, while bank credits jumped to 39%, and retained enterprise earnings reached 34%.<ref name=\"Decentralization\"/> The pilot enterprises did very well, earning profits that were double the norm.<ref name=\"Decentralization\"/> By 1967 two-thirds of industrial production came from firms under the new system, which by that time had embraced areas outside consumer production.<ref name=\"Decentralization\"/>\n\n[[File:Cocacola cyrilic.JPG|thumb|left|upright|130px|Zhivkov's reforms resulted in some expansion of trade with the West, as evidenced by licensed [[Coca-Cola]] production since the 1960s with a [[Cyrillic]] logo]]\n\nBefore the end of the 1960s, however, Bulgarian economic planning moved back toward the conventional CPE approach. Many Western analysts attributed the Bulgarian retreat from the reforms of the 1960s to tension caused by the [[Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia]] in 1968. International events may well have played a role, but the timing of the retreat and the invasion suggest another component: dissatisfaction among the Party elite with the results and ideological implications of the reform.<ref name=\"Recentralization\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0114) Industrial Recentralization]</ref> For example, in July 1968, one month before the invasion of Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria's unorthodox, three-tiered pricing system was eliminated. The party leadership had never accepted the concept of free and flexible pricing for some products, which was an important Bulgarian departure from centralized planning in the 1960s.<ref name=\"Recentralization\"/> Resistance to reform was further encouraged by a series of cases in which major enterprise directors used newly decentralized financial resources to line their own pockets.<ref name=\"Recentralization\"/> However, some of the recentralization measures, such as the creation of an agricultural-industrial complex, also received domestic criticism.<ref name=\"Units\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0115) Larger Economic Units], Library of Congress</ref> Both Western and domestic customers remained dissatisfied with the quality of many Bulgarian manufactures.

In 1983 Zhivkov harshly criticized all of Bulgarian industry and agriculture in a major speech, but the reforms generated by his speech did nothing to improve the situation.<ref name=\"1980s\"/> A large percentage of high-quality domestic goods were shipped abroad in the early 1980s to shrink Bulgaria's hard-currency debt, and the purchase of Western technology was sacrificed for the same reason, crippling technical advancement and disillusioning consumers.

This led to a Bulgarian version of the Soviet [[perestroika]] program. After a round of failed experimental measures, in January 1989 the Party issued Decree Number 56. This decree established \"firms\" as the primary unit of economic management.<ref name=\"Last round\"/> In a fundamental departure from the socialist prohibition of private citizens hiring labor, as many as ten people could now be hired permanently, and an unlimited number could be hired on temporary contracts.<ref name=\"Last round\"/> This last round of reforms by the Zhivkov regime confused rather than improved economic performance.

Consistent social policies led to an increase in life expectancy to 68.1 years for men and 74.4 years for women.<ref name=\"Health\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0099) Health], Library of Congress</ref> In 1939 the mortality rate for children under one year had been 138.9 per 1,000; by 1986 it was 18.2 per 1,000, and in 1990 it was 14 per 1,000, the lowest rate in Eastern Europe.<ref name=\"Health\"/> The proportion of long-lived people in Bulgaria was quite large; a 1988 study cited a figure of 52 centenarians per 1 million inhabitants. One of the first mass HIV testing programs was initiated under Zhivkov, and as of October 1989, some 2.5 million people in Bulgaria, including about 66,000 foreigners, had been tested for HIV, and 81 Bulgarians were diagnosed as HIV positive.<ref name=\"Health\"/> Increases in real incomes in agriculture rose by 6.7 percent per year during the 1960s. During this same period, industrial wages increased by 4.9 percent annually.<ref name=\"Standards\"/> Availability of consumer durables significantly improved in the 1970s. According to official statistics, between 1965 and 1988 the number of televisions per 100 households increased from 8 to 100; radios increased from 59 to 95; refrigerators from 5 to 96; washing machines from 23 to 96; and automobiles from 2 to 40. Available automobiles were primarily Soviet Fiats, some of which were manufactured in Bulgaria.<ref name=\"Standards\"/>\n\nIn the postwar era, and especially under Zhivkov, housing in Bulgaria improved significantly as more and better-quality homes were built.<ref name=\"Housing\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0100) Housing], Library of Congress</ref> However, many of them were cramped - the average home in Bulgaria had three rooms and an area of {{convert|65|m2}}.<ref name=\"Housing\"/> Housing remained one of the most serious shortcomings in the Bulgarian standard of living throughout Zhivkov's rule. Residential construction targets in the Five-Year Plans were regularly underfulfilled. Consequently, families often waited several years for apartments; in Sofia, where overcrowding was at its worst, the wait was as long as ten years.<ref name=\"Standards\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0144) Standards of living], Library of Congress</ref>\n\nThe educational system, despite the addition of ideological subjects, remained relatively unchanged after the beginning of the Communist era. In 1979 Zhivkov introduced a sweeping educational reform, claiming that [[Marxism|Marxist]] teachings on educating youth were still not being applied completely.<ref name=\"Education\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0101) Education], Library of Congress</ref> Zhivkov therefore created Unified Secondary Polytechnical Schools (''Edinni sredni politekhnicheski uchilishta'', ESPU), in which all students would receive the same general education.

Thus, he claims in his memoirs that the USSR had become \"a raw material appendage to Bulgaria,\" something obliquely confirmed by Gorbachev when he wrote in his memoirs that \"Bulgaria was a country which had lived beyond its means for a long time.\" An example of how the \"raw material appendage\" was exploited was the trade in Soviet [[crude oil]]. This would be shipped to Bulgaria's modern [[Oil refinery|refinery]] in [[Burgas]] at subsidized prices, processed, and resold on world markets at a huge premium.\n\nIn 1963 and 1973, the Zhivkov regime made requests \u2014 it is unclear how far these were in earnest \u2014 that\nBulgaria be incorporated into the USSR, both times because the Bulgarian government, having engaged in\nbitter polemics with [[Yugoslavia]] over the [[Macedonia naming dispute]], feared a Soviet\u2013Yugoslav reconciliation at its own expense. In 1963, following the decision of [[Patriarch Alexy I of Moscow]] to recognize the autonomy of the [[Macedonian Orthodox Church]], the Bulgarian leaders openly declared that there was no \"historic Macedonian nation.\" In the face of Moscow's post-1953 efforts to reach out to Belgrade and Athens, Zhivkov seems to have calculated that a policy of unswerving loyalty to the Kremlin would ensure that it remained more valuable for the USSR than non-aligned Yugoslavia or NATO-affiliated Greece.<ref>Bal\u00e1zs Szalontai, Political and Economic Relations between Communist States.

In 1984 the 9,000 Bulgarian advisers stationed in Libya for military and nonmilitary aid put that country in first place among Bulgaria's [[Third World]] clients. Through its Kintex arms export enterprise, Bulgaria also engaged in covert military support activities, many of which were subsequently disclosed. In the 1970s, diplomatic crises with [[Sudan]] and [[Egypt]] were triggered by Bulgarian involvement in coup plots.<ref name=\"Affairs\"/>\n\nUnder Zhivkov Bulgaria's policy toward [[Western Europe]] and the [[United States]] was determined largely by the position of the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"Western Europe\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0193) Western Europe and the US], Library of Congress</ref> Events such as the invasions of Czechoslovakia and [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]] automatically distanced Bulgaria from the West; then, in the early 1980s Soviet efforts to split NATO by cultivating Western Europe brought Bulgaria closer to [[France]] and [[West Germany]] - a position that continued through the 1980s.

The [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]] in late 1979, which Bulgaria supported vigorously, renewed tension between Bulgaria and the West.

In early 1989, Bulgaria signed a ten-year bilateral economic agreement with Greece.<ref name=\"Greece\"/>\n\n=== Cultural ===\n\nUntil the late 1980s, Zhivkov successfully prevented unrest in the Bulgarian intellectual community.<ref name=\"Inteligentsia\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0181) Zhivkov and the Intelligentsia], Library of Congress</ref> Membership in the writers' union brought enormous privilege and social stature, and that drew many dissident writers such as Georgi Dzhagarov and Lyubomir Levchev into the circle of the officially approved intelligentsia. On the other hand, entry required intellectual compromise, and refusal to compromise led to dismissal from the union and loss of all privileges. The punishment of dissident writers sometimes went far beyond loss of privileges. In 1978 \u00e9migr\u00e9 writer [[Georgi Markov]] was murdered in London for his anticommunist broadcasts for the British Broadcasting Corporation, and [[Blaga Dimitrova]] was harshly denounced for her critical portrayal of party officials in her 1982 novel ''Litse''.<ref name=\"Inteligentsia\"/>\n\nZhivkov also softened organized opposition by restoring symbols of the Bulgarian cultural past that had been cast aside in the postwar campaign to consolidate Soviet-style party control. Beginning in 1967, he appealed loudly to the people to remember \"our motherland Bulgaria\".<ref name=\"Inteligentsia\"/> In the late 1970s, Zhivkov mended relations with the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church]].<ref name=\"Inteligentsia\"/> Zhivkov's extensive campaign of cultural restoration provided at least some common ground between him and the Bulgarian intelligentsia. In 1980 Zhivkov had improved his domestic position by appointing his daughter [[Lyudmila Zhivkova]] as chair of the commission on science, culture, and art.<ref name=\"Athmosphere\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0068) The Political Atmosphere in the 1970s], Library of Congress</ref> In this powerful position, Zhivkova became extremely popular by promoting Bulgaria's separate national cultural heritage. She spent large sums of money in a highly visible campaign to support scholars, collect Bulgarian art, and sponsor cultural institutions. Among her policies was closer cultural contact with the West; her most visible project was the spectacular national celebration of [[1300th Anniversary of the Bulgarian State|Bulgaria's 1,300th anniversary]] in 1981. When Zhivkova died in 1981, relations with the West had already been chilled by the Afghanistan issue, but her brief administration of Bulgaria's official cultural life was a successful phase of her father's appeal to Bulgarian national tradition to bind the country together.<ref name=\"Athmosphere\"/>\n\nSports also prospered during Zhivkov's rule. From 1956 to 1988, Bulgaria won an unprecedented 153 Olympic medals and numerous European and world competitions in sports as diverse as [[volleyball]], [[rhythmic gymnastics]] and [[wrestling]].\n\n== Dissent and human rights violations ==\n\nDissent was punished under Zhivkov's rule. The CSS was a feared tool of control, and overt opposition largely stayed underground until the late 1980s. In 1978, the Bulgarian dissident [[Georgi Markov]] was assassinated in London by an agent who stabbed him with an umbrella tip which implanted a very small [[ricin]] ball. According to former [[KGB]] [[general]] [[Oleg Kalugin]], this was requested by Zhivkov and either performed by the [[KGB]] or it assisted the CSS; the actual assassin is reputed to have been [[Francesco Gullino]], working for the CSS. In Zhivkov's time, Bulgarians found it extremely difficult to travel abroad.\n\nZhivkov was particularly intolerant of dissent within the Party.  When [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] announced his reform program, Zhivkov made a show of copying it, believing that Gorbachev wasn't really serious about ''[[glasnost]]'' or ''[[perestroika]].''<ref name=Revolution1989>{{cite book|last=Sebetsyen|first=Victor|title=Revolution 1989: The Fall of the Soviet Empire|publisher=[[Pantheon Books]]|location=New York City|year=2009|isbn=0-375-42532-2|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/revolution1989fa00sebe}}</ref>  However, he showed his true colors when he expelled several members of a human-rights watch group from the Party. Soon afterward, when several intellectuals announced the formation of the \"Club for the Support of Perestroika and Glasnost,\" he arrested the leaders and threw them out of the Party.<ref name=Thompson>{{cite book |title=The World Today Series: Nordic, Central and Southeastern Europe 2008|last=Thompson |first=Wayne C. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2008 |publisher=Stryker-Post Publications |location=Harpers Ferry, West Virginia |ISBN=978-1-887985-95-6}}</ref>\n\n<!-- Unreferenced section : == Nepotism and insistence on ''predanost'' ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\nZhivkov married Mara Maleeva (1911\u20131971) in 1938. They had two children, both would be promoted in the BCP hierarchy, daughter [[Lyudmila Zhivkova]] and son Vladimir Zhivkov. Lyudmila became a Politburo member and earned the ire of the BCP and Bulgaria's benefactors in [[Moscow]] with her unorthodox artistic ideas and practice of Eastern religions. She died abruptly at the age of 38 in 1981. Her health was severely compromised by stress, failed marriages, and unusual dietary/lifestyle practices, although rumours of assassination or suicide abounded. With Lyudmila's death, her friends and supporters were quickly removed from all positions of power. Son-in-law [[Ivan Slavkov]] was made chairman of Bulgaria's state television company and later became president of the [[Bulgarian Olympic Committee]].\n\nApart from promoting his family, Zhivkov instituted a complex system of privileges which extended to former Resistance figures, Party members and ''prominenti'' of the sciences, arts and manufacture. In the early 1960s, he was instrumental in constructing a large set of housing, financial, educational, electoral and other benefits to be granted to a large category of people called \"Active Fighters against Capitalism and Fascism\" who had ostensibly been members of the rather modest Bulgarian Wartime resistance and which was expanded to absurd proportions. Without necessarily receiving great remuneration (pay differentials under Zhivkov were within the 5:1 range, with the overwhelming majority of salaries being within the 3:1 range), Party members and CSS informers received very significant perquisites which involved access to accommodation, luxury imported goods, hard currency, the ability to travel abroad, superior medical and dental treatment and unhindered entry to higher education for their children. The scope of these privileges broadened as they rose in the Party hierarchy. Eminent artists, scientists and \"Heroes of Socialist Labour\" (mostly collective farmers and shop-floor workers) received similar privileges. Established in the early years of Zhivkov's terms in power, [[Corecom]] was a retail chain in which foreigners could shop with hard currency, but its main customers were privileged Bulgarians close to the Zhivkov regime.\n\nIn Zhivkov's Bulgaria, money had lost many of its traditional properties, being replaced by sets of complex personal and family material and career considerations which have been described as \"feudal\". This hampered the prosecution in post-Zhivkov fraud and corruption trials, since no venality could be proved against those charged: they had merely received goods in kind and services which moreover had been their \"legal due\".\n\nZhivkov reserved a special attention for his birthplace of [[Pravets]]. In the 1960s this small village was declared \"an Urban Community,\" becoming a town a decade later. In 1982 Bulgaria's first Apple clone personal computer was named the ''Pravets''. The grateful citizens of Pravets responded by erecting a heroic statue to Zhivkov which he duly had taken down, ostensibly to prevent a personal cult growing around him. It was re-erected after his death.\n\nThroughout his tenure of power, Zhivkov surrounded himself with those who exhibited ''predanost'' (loyalty, devotion, the desire to proffer all). In his reminiscences, Vladimir Kostov, a Bulgarian secret agent who defected to [[France]] in 1978, recalls how the powerful minister of internal affairs would suffer nervous episodes before meeting Zhivkov lest his ''predanost'' should fail to come across sufficiently expressively..-->\n\n== Image ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\nThroughout his tenure, Zhivkov's [[dialect]] and poor manners made him the butt of many acerbic jibes and jokes in Bulgaria's urbane circles. While the feared CSS secret police was commonly said to persecute those who told political jokes, Zhivkov himself was said to have found them amusing and \"collected\" an archive of them. His popular nickname was \"bai Tosho\" (approximately \"Ol' Uncle Tosho\") or occasionally (and later) \"Tato\" (a dialectal word for [[Father|\"Dad\" or \"Pop\"]]). Markov tells a story of how Zhivkov reproached a popular newspaper cartoonist for modifying his signature to resemble a pig's tail, yet did not persecute him. A handful of satirist dissidents such as [[Radoy Ralin]] enjoyed some prominence, although Ralin was not favored by the authorities due to his sharp satire.\n\nZhivkov survived the [[Sino-Soviet split]], Khrushchev's fall in October 1964, an attempted Stalinist-Maoist ''[[Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat attempt of 1965|coup d\u2019\u00e9tat]]'' in 1965, his daughter [[Lyudmila Zhivkova]]'s death in 1981, [[Death and funeral of Leonid Brezhnev|Brezhnev's death]] in 1982, and [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s post-1985 reforms.\n\n== Fall ==\n\nIn December 1984, Todor Zhivkov began a campaign of forcible assimilation of Bulgaria's Turkish minority, most notably forcing all Turks to take Bulgarian names. By 1989, resistance to this policy led to riots, which resulted in multiple deaths. In May 1989, Zhivkov ordered an expulsion of Turks (and Muslims) to Turkey across the then [[Iron Curtain]] boundary between these two countries. This led to the largest [[ethnic cleansing]] in Europe during the [[Cold War]], in which over 360,000 Turks (and Muslims) were targeted within three months.<ref>See:'2. \u041e\u0431\u044f\u0432\u044f\u0432\u0430\u043c\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0433\u043e\u043d\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0434 360 000 \u0431\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438 \u043e\u0442 \u0442\u0443\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0437\u0445\u043e\u0434 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0437 1989 \u0433. \u0437\u0430 \u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0435\u0442\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0447\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0435, \u0438\u0437\u0432\u044a\u0440\u0448\u0435\u043d\u043e \u043e\u0442 \u0442\u043e\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0440\u0435\u0436\u0438\u043c.'

Bulgaria was the target of near-unanimous condemnation from the international community; even the Soviets protested. Gorbachev already did not think much of Zhivkov; he had lumped Zhivkov in with a group of inflexible hardliners that included [[East Germany]]'s [[Erich Honecker]], [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia's]] [[Gust\u00e1v Hus\u00e1k]] and [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania's]] [[Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu]].  However, after the Turkish episode, he was determined to see Zhivkov gone.  The Turkish affair also alarmed several high-ranking Bulgarian officials as well, including [[Prime Minister of Bulgaria|Prime Minister]] [[Georgi Atanasov (politician)|Georgi Atanasov]], Foreign Minister [[Petar Mladenov]] and Finance Minister [[Andrey Lukanov]].  They began plotting to remove him, but had to move discreetly given the ubiquity of the CSS.<ref name=Revolution1989/>\n\nIn October 1989, Mladenov organised a [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|CSCE]] environmental summit in Sofia.  He invited an independent group of Bulgarian environmental activists, Ecoglasnost, to participate.  Ten days into the conference, several Ecoglasnost activists and supporters were brutally beaten up by CSS and militia officers\u2014on orders from Zhivkov.  They then collared 36 other opposition activists, drove them to the countryside and forced them to walk back to Sofia.  Amid near-unanimous international condemnation, Mladenov, Lukanov and Atanasov decided that Zhivkov had to go.  In a critical step, they convinced Defence Minister [[Dobri Dzhurov]] to support them.<ref name=Revolution1989/><ref name=Thompson/>\n\nThe plotters struck on 9 November, a day before a Politburo meeting.  Dzhurov met Zhivkov in private and told him that he needed to resign, and there was enough support on the Politburo to vote him out. Zhivkov was taken by surprise and tried to marshal support, to no avail. Just before the Politburo met on 10 November, Dzhurov gave Zhivkov an ultimatum\u2013unless Zhivkov resigned, the Politburo would not only vote him out, but have him executed. Seeing the writing on the wall after the motion calling for his removal passed, Zhivkov resigned, officially for reasons of age and health. Mladenov was elected his successor. On 17 November the National Assembly removed him from the post of Chairman of the State Council, replacing him with Mladenov.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/18/world/clamor-east-bulgarian-leader-hints-future-free-voting-other-changes.html|title=Bulgarian Leader Hints at Free Voting and Other Changes|last=Haberman|first=Clyde|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=1989-11-18}}</ref><ref name=Revolution1989/><ref name=Thompson/>\n\nOn 11 December, only a month after Zhivkov's ouster, Mladenov called for the Communist Party to give up its guaranteed right to rule.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/12/world/upheaval-east-bulgaria-s-communist-chief-plans-relax-grip-hold-elections.html|title=Bulgaria's Communist Chief Plans To Relax Grip and Hold Elections|last=Haberman|first=Clyde|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=1989-12-12}}</ref> The Central Committee fell into line two days later, calling for free elections in the spring and asking the National Assembly to delete the portions of the Constitution that enshrined the party's \"leading role\".<ref name=expel>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/14/world/upheaval-in-the-east-communists-in-bulgaria-expel-zhivkov.html|title=Communists in Bulgaria Expel Zhivkov|last=Haberman|first=Clyde|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=1989-12-14}}</ref>  On 15 January, the National Assembly struck out the portions of the constitution giving the Communist Party a monopoly of power.

On 13 December, Zhivkov was expelled from the party for what Lukanov described as \"gross violations of laws and gross mistakes in politics\".<ref name=expel/> Mladenov contended that Zhivkov's stewardship had left the country in \"a near heart-attack condition\".<ref name=expel/> The party also began an investigation into Zhivkov's high living.\n\nAfter being placed under house arrest on 18 January 1990, on 25 February 1991, Zhivkov was brought to stand trial on charges of [[embezzling]] the equivalent of $24 million (in 1990 dollars) in government funds. There had been calls to try him for political crimes as well, but prosecutors balked, believing they did not have enough evidence to convict him. On 4 September 1992 after an 18-month trial, he was convicted of embezzlement and sentenced to seven years in prison.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/05/world/ousted-bulgarian-gets-7-year-term-for-embezzlement.html|title=Ousted Bulgarian Gets 7-Year Term For Embezzlement|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=1992-09-05}}</ref> Due to old age and heart problems, he was allowed to serve his term under [[house arrest]] at his granddaughter's home.

Like the Soviet Bloc in the face of the [[Council for Mutual Economic Assistance]] (SEV, Comecon), the [[Warsaw Pact Organization]] and the USSR itself collapsed, by 1992 Bulgaria entered a period of transition from socialism to a free market economy and democracy. The country's political ideology and foreign policies of Zhivkov's era have thus been reversed.\n\nZhivkov's onslaught on Bulgaria's Muslims and Turks radicalized and united what had been scattered and quiescent minorities. Since 2001 (and also from 1991 to 1994) the DPS ([[Movement for Rights and Freedoms]]) party, composed almost entirely of Bulgarian Turks, has held the balance of power in Bulgarian politics. Thus, one of the major Zhivkov projects produced the very opposite effect of what had been intended.\n\nA most damaging process, which emerged during the early years of Zhivkov's rule, was the \"demographic problem\" which saw traditionally large Bulgarian village families emigrate to industrial cities where they tended to have one child or none at all. The reforms undertaken during Zhivkov's regime consisted mostly of fines for families without children and limiting abortion.\n\n===Economic===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\nOn the other hand, after very significant reverses and difficulties in the 1940s and 1950s, the Bulgarian economy developed apace from the mid-1960s until the late 1970s. Most of today's large industrial facilities such as the [[Kremikovtsi]] steelworks and the Chervena Mogila engineering works were built under Zhivkov. Bulgaria's nuclear power station, [[AEC Kozloduy]], was built in the 1970s, all six large reactors commissioned in under five years. This, and Bulgaria's many coal-fired and hydroelectric power stations, made the country a major electric power exporter. By the 1970s, the focus switched to high technologies such as electronics and even space exploration: on 10 April 1979 Bulgaria launched the first of two ''kosmonavti'' (cosmonauts), [[Georgi Ivanov (cosmonaut)|Georgi Ivanov]], aboard Soviet ''[[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz]]'' spaceships and later launched its own space satellites. Having been among the first nations to market electronic calculators (the [[ELKA]] brand, since 1973) and digital watches ([[Elektronika]], since 1975), in 1982 the country launched its [[Pravetz series 8|Pravets]] personal computer (a near-\"[[Apple II]] clone\") for business and domestic use. In the mid-1960s an economic reform package was introduced, which allowed for farmers to freely sell their overplanned production. Shortly after that Bulgaria became the first and only Eastern Bloc country which locally produced [[Coca-Cola]]. Mass tourism developed under Zhivkov's direction from the early 1960s onwards.\n\nHowever, this Bulgarian economy was exceptionally susceptible to Soviet largesse and Soviet-bloc markets. After the Soviet crude oil price shock of 1979, it entered a very severe recession from which it hardly recovered in the 1980s. After the early-1990s loss of Soviet and Comecon markets, this economy (unused to competing in a free market environment) entered prolonged and significant contraction. Zhivkov-era industrial facilities were largely unattractive to investors, many being left to decay. Great numbers of specialist personnel retired and died without being replaced, or else emigrated or left their state jobs for more lucrative private employment. As agriculture declined, tourism has emerged as almost the sole Zhivkov-era industrial survivor. It is however widely regarded that incompetent administration after 1989 had a much greater effect on the decline of the economy, as even successful industries declined.\n\n==Honours and awards==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\n;Bulgaria\n* {{Flagicon|People's Republic of Bulgaria|1971}} [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]: [[Order of Georgi Dimitrov]]\n* {{Flagicon|People's Republic of Bulgaria|1971}} [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]: [[Hero of Socialist Labour|Hero of Socialist Labour (Bulgaria)]]\n* {{Flagicon|People's Republic of Bulgaria|1971}} [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]: [[Hero of the People's Republic of Bulgaria]]\n* {{Flagicon|People's Republic of Bulgaria|1971}} [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]: Grand Master of the [[Order of Saints Cyril and Methodius|Order of Cyril and Methodius]]\n\n;Foreign\n* {{Flag|Soviet Union}}: [[Gold Star]] [[Hero of the Soviet Union]] (No. 11281) (31 May 1977 -

The following year he obtained a post at the ''Darzhavna pechatnitsa'', the official government publisher in [[Sofia]]. In 1932, he joined the BWP proper, later serving as secretary of its Second Borough Committee and as a member of its Sofia County Committee. Although the BWP was banned along with all other political parties after the uprising of [[1934 Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat|19 May 1934]], it continued fielding a handful of non-party National Assembly Deputies and Zhivkov retained his posts at its Sofia structure.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Zhivkov participated in Bulgaria's resistance movement against the country's alignment with [[Nazi Germany]] and was sympathetic to the country's 50,000 Jews.<ref>Bar-Zohar, Michael, ''Beyond Hitler's Grasp: The Heroic Rescue of Bulgaria's Jews''. Adams Media Corp. 1998, p.199</ref> In 1943, he was involved in organising the [[Chavdar (resistance brigade)|Chavdar]] partisan detachment in and around his place of birth, becoming deputy commander of the Sofia operations area in the summer of 1944. Under his rule, many fellow former combatants with Chavdar were to rise to positions of prominence in Bulgarian affairs. He is said to have coordinated partisan movements with those of pro-Soviet army units during the [[1944 Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat|9 September 1944 uprising]].\n\n== Rise to power ==\n[[File:Todor Zhivkov and Georgi Dimitrov.jpg|thumb|Todor Zhivkov and Georgi Dimitrov in a Fatherland Front congress in 1946.]]\nAfter 9 September 1944, Zhivkov became head of the [[Sofia]] police force, restyled as the ''Narodna Militsiya'' (People's Militia). He was elected to the BCP [[Central Committee]] as a candidate member in 1945 and a full member in 1948. In the run-up to the 1949 treason trial against [[Traicho Kostov]], Zhivkov criticised the Party and judicial authorities for what he claimed was their leniency with regard to Kostov. This placed him in the [[Stalinist]] [[hardline]] wing of the Party. In 1950, Zhivkov became a candidate member of the BCP [[Politburo]], then led by [[Vulko Chervenkov]], leading to a full membership in 1951. In the years which followed, he was involved in countering countryside resistance to forced [[collective farming|farm collectivisation]] in northwestern Bulgaria.\n\nAfter [[Joseph Stalin]]'s death, an emphasis on shared leadership emerged. The hardline Stalinist Chervenkov gave up his post as General Secretary of the BCP in 1954. Zhivkov took his place, but Chervenkov retained most of his powers as [[prime minister]]. Bulgarian opinion at the time interpreted this as a self-preservation move by Chervenkov, since Zhivkov was a less well known figure in the party. After [[Nikita Khrushchev]] delivered his famous secret speech against Stalin at the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] 20th Congress, a BCP Central Committee plenary meeting was convened in April 1956 to agree to adopt a new Krushchevite line. At that ''plenum'', Zhivkov criticized Chervenkov as a disciple of Stalin, had him demoted from prime minister to a cabinet post, and promoted former [[Committee for State Security (Bulgaria)|Committee for State Security]] (CSS) head [[Anton Yugov]] to the post of prime minister. It was at this point that he became the ''de facto'' leader of Bulgaria. Subsequently, Zhivkov was associated with the \"April Line,\" which had [[anti-Stalinist]] credentials. At the BCP 8th Congress in late 1962, Zhivkov accused Yugov of anti-Party activity, expelled him from the BCP and had him placed under [[house arrest]].\n\nWith the increasingly strengthening positions of Zhivkov as the country's and Communist party's leader, former [[Partisan (military)|partisan]] leaders and active military took a critical stance on the [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionist]] policies of the communist leadership. In the events described as the \"[[Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat attempt of 1965|April Conspiracy]]\" of 1965 or the \"Plot of Gorunia,\" general [[Ivan Todorov-Gorunia]], general [[Tzviatko Anev]] (''\u0426\u0432\u044f\u0442\u043a\u043e \u0410\u043d\u0435\u0432'') and [[Tzolo \u041arastev]] (''\u0426\u043e\u043b\u043e \u041a\u0440\u044a\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0432'') organized a group of high-ranking military officers planning to overthrow the regime. Their plan was to establish a pro-Chinese leadership in the country. The coup was exposed and between 28 March and 12 April 1965 and most of the plotters were arrested.\n\nAs prime minister, Zhivkov then held both of Bulgaria's leading political and government posts; for nearly all of Bulgaria's existence as an independent nation, the prime minister has been reckoned as the country's leading political figure. Though the post of head of state was traditionally reserved for the leader of the surviving pro-Communist faction of the [[Bulgarian Agrarian National Union]], the \"[[Zhivkov Constitution]]\" adopted by referendum in July 1971 promoted him to chairman of the new State Council. The post, equivalent to that of president, confirmed his position as the country's top leader. Zhivkov remained faithful to Moscow during his 35 years in power, but adopted a more liberal stance than his predecessor by allowing some market reforms (such as allowing surplus agricultural goods to be sold for profit) and ending persecution of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church.\n\n== Policies ==\n=== Economic ===\nIn the mid-1950s, Soviet-style centralized planning produced economic indicators showing that Bulgarians were returning to their prewar lifestyle in some respects: real wages increased 75%, consumption of meat, fruit, and vegetables increased markedly, medical facilities and doctors became available to more of the population, and in 1957 collective farm workers benefited from the first agricultural pension and welfare system in Eastern Europe.<ref name=\"Domestic Policy\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0062) Domestic Policy and Its Results], Library of Congress</ref>\n\nIn 1959 the Communist Party borrowed from the Chinese [[Great Leap Forward]] to symbolize a sudden burst of economic activity to be injected into the Third Five-Year Plan (1958\u20131962), whose original scope was quite conservative. According to the revised plan, industrial production would double and agricultural production would triple by 1962; a new agricultural collectivization and consolidation drive would achieve great economies of scale in that branch; investment in light industry would double, and foreign trade would expand.<ref name=\"Domestic Policy\"/> Following the Chinese model, all of Bulgarian society was to be propagandized and mobilized to meet the planning goals.<ref name=\"Domestic Policy\"/> Two purposes of the grandiose revised plan were to keep Bulgaria in step with the Soviet bloc, all of whose members were embarking on plans for accelerated growth, and to quell internal party conflicts. Amalgamation of collective farms cut their number by 70 percent, after which average farm acreage was second only to the Soviet Union among countries in Eastern Europe.<ref name=\"Plan\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0111) The First Five-Year Plans], Library of Congress</ref> Zhivkov, whose \"theses\" had defined the goals of the plan, purged Politburo members and party rivals [[Boris Taskov]] (in 1959) and [[Anton Yugov]] (in 1962), citing their criticism of his policy as economically obstructionist. Already by 1960, however, Zhivkov had been forced to redefine the impossible goals of his theses.<ref name=\"Domestic Policy\"/> Lack of skilled labor and materials made completion of projects at the prescribed pace impossible. Harvests were disastrously poor in the early 1960s; peasant unrest forced the government to raise food prices; and the urban dissatisfaction that resulted from higher prices compounded a crisis that broke in the summer of 1962. Blame fell on Zhivkov's experiments with decentralized planning, which was totally abandoned by 1963.<ref name=\"Domestic Policy\"/> Despite this, by 1960 the value produced by heavy industry matched that of light industry, and food processing for export grew rapidly.<ref name=\"Plan\"/> Throughout the second phase, budget expenditures consisted primarily of reinvestment in sectors given initial priority. The completion of collectivization in 1958 had shifted 678,000 peasants, about 20 percent of the active labor force, into industrial jobs.<ref name=\"Plan\"/>\n\n[[File:BlockOs-68-Gl 3.JPG|thumb|right|Large-scale industrialization caused many laborers to move from rural to urban areas, which required the construction of numerous pre-fabricated apartment buildings such as this one in Sofia]]\n\nBy the early 1960s, however, changes to the system were obviously needed to achieve sustained growth in all branches of production, including agriculture.<ref name=\"Experimentation\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0111) The Era of Experimentation and Reform], Library of Congress</ref> Specific incentives to reform were shortages of labor and energy and the growing importance of foreign trade in the \"thaw\" years of the mid-1960s. Consequently, in 1962 the Fourth Five-Year Plan began an era of economic reform that brought a series of new approaches to the old goal of [[intensive growth]].<ref name=\"Experimentation\"/> In industry the \"New System of Management\" was introduced in 1964 and lasted until 1968. This approach intended to streamline economic units and make enterprise managers more responsible for performance. In June 1964, about fifty industrial enterprises, mostly producers of [[textiles]] and other consumer goods, were placed under the new system. [[Wage]]s, bonuses, and investment funds were tied to enterprise profits, up to 70% of which could be retained.<ref name=\"Decentralization\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0113) Industrial decentralization], Library of Congress</ref> Outside investment funds were to come primarily from [[bank credit]] rather than the [[state budget]]. In 1965 state subsidies still accounted for 63% of enterprise investment funds, however, while 30% came from retained enterprise earnings and only 7% from bank credits.<ref name=\"Decentralization\"/> By 1970 budget subsidies accounted for only 27% of investment funds, while bank credits jumped to 39%, and retained enterprise earnings reached 34%.<ref name=\"Decentralization\"/> The pilot enterprises did very well, earning profits that were double the norm.<ref name=\"Decentralization\"/> By 1967 two-thirds of industrial production came from firms under the new system, which by that time had embraced areas outside consumer production.<ref name=\"Decentralization\"/>\n\n[[File:Cocacola cyrilic.JPG|thumb|left|upright|130px|Zhivkov's reforms resulted in some expansion of trade with the West, as evidenced by licensed [[Coca-Cola]] production since the 1960s with a [[Cyrillic]] logo]]\n\nBefore the end of the 1960s, however, Bulgarian economic planning moved back toward the conventional CPE approach. Many Western analysts attributed the Bulgarian retreat from the reforms of the 1960s to tension caused by the [[Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia]] in 1968. International events may well have played a role, but the timing of the retreat and the invasion suggest another component: dissatisfaction among the Party elite with the results and ideological implications of the reform.<ref name=\"Recentralization\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0114) Industrial Recentralization]</ref> For example, in July 1968, one month before the invasion of Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria's unorthodox, three-tiered pricing system was eliminated. The party leadership had never accepted the concept of free and flexible pricing for some products, which was an important Bulgarian departure from centralized planning in the 1960s.<ref name=\"Recentralization\"/> Resistance to reform was further encouraged by a series of cases in which major enterprise directors used newly decentralized financial resources to line their own pockets.<ref name=\"Recentralization\"/> However, some of the recentralization measures, such as the creation of an agricultural-industrial complex, also received domestic criticism.<ref name=\"Units\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0115) Larger Economic Units], Library of Congress</ref> Both Western and domestic customers remained dissatisfied with the quality of many Bulgarian manufactures.

In 1983 Zhivkov harshly criticized all of Bulgarian industry and agriculture in a major speech, but the reforms generated by his speech did nothing to improve the situation.<ref name=\"1980s\"/> A large percentage of high-quality domestic goods were shipped abroad in the early 1980s to shrink Bulgaria's hard-currency debt, and the purchase of Western technology was sacrificed for the same reason, crippling technical advancement and disillusioning consumers.

This led to a Bulgarian version of the Soviet [[perestroika]] program. After a round of failed experimental measures, in January 1989 the Party issued Decree Number 56. This decree established \"firms\" as the primary unit of economic management.<ref name=\"Last round\"/> In a fundamental departure from the socialist prohibition of private citizens hiring labor, as many as ten people could now be hired permanently, and an unlimited number could be hired on temporary contracts.<ref name=\"Last round\"/> This last round of reforms by the Zhivkov regime confused rather than improved economic performance. However, statistics on growth for 1986-88 still indicated a 5.5% annual rate, up from the 3.7% rate achieved during the previous five-year plan.<ref name=\"Last round\"/>\n\n=== Social ===\n[[File:Gini since WWII.svg|right|thumb|230px|Zhivkov's social policies resulted in Bulgaria having [[Gini coefficient]] of 18 in the 1970s, ranking among the countries with the lowest levels of [[income inequality]] in the world]]\n\nEven before Zhivkov, Bulgaria made significant progress in increasing life expectancy and decreasing infant mortality rates. Consistent social policies led to an increase in life expectancy to 68.1 years for men and 74.4 years for women.<ref name=\"Health\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0099) Health], Library of Congress</ref> In 1939 the mortality rate for children under one year had been 138.9 per 1,000; by 1986 it was 18.2 per 1,000, and in 1990 it was 14 per 1,000, the lowest rate in Eastern Europe.<ref name=\"Health\"/> The proportion of long-lived people in Bulgaria was quite large; a 1988 study cited a figure of 52 centenarians per 1 million inhabitants. One of the first mass HIV testing programs was initiated under Zhivkov, and as of October 1989, some 2.5 million people in Bulgaria, including about 66,000 foreigners, had been tested for HIV, and 81 Bulgarians were diagnosed as HIV positive.<ref name=\"Health\"/> Increases in real incomes in agriculture rose by 6.7 percent per year during the 1960s. During this same period, industrial wages increased by 4.9 percent annually.<ref name=\"Standards\"/> Availability of consumer durables significantly improved in the 1970s. According to official statistics, between 1965 and 1988 the number of televisions per 100 households increased from 8 to 100; radios increased from 59 to 95; refrigerators from 5 to 96; washing machines from 23 to 96; and automobiles from 2 to 40. Available automobiles were primarily Soviet Fiats, some of which were manufactured in Bulgaria.<ref name=\"Standards\"/>\n\nIn the postwar era, and especially under Zhivkov, housing in Bulgaria improved significantly as more and better-quality homes were built.<ref name=\"Housing\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0100) Housing], Library of Congress</ref> However, many of them were cramped - the average home in Bulgaria had three rooms and an area of {{convert|65|m2}}.<ref name=\"Housing\"/> Housing remained one of the most serious shortcomings in the Bulgarian standard of living throughout Zhivkov's rule. Residential construction targets in the Five-Year Plans were regularly underfulfilled. Consequently, families often waited several years for apartments; in Sofia, where overcrowding was at its worst, the wait was as long as ten years.<ref name=\"Standards\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0144) Standards of living], Library of Congress</ref>\n\nThe educational system, despite the addition of ideological subjects, remained relatively unchanged after the beginning of the Communist era. In 1979 Zhivkov introduced a sweeping educational reform, claiming that [[Marxism|Marxist]] teachings on educating youth were still not being applied completely.<ref name=\"Education\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0101) Education], Library of Congress</ref> Zhivkov therefore created Unified Secondary Polytechnical Schools (''Edinni sredni politekhnicheski uchilishta'', ESPU), in which all students would receive the same general education. The system united previously separate specialized middle schools in a single, twelve-grade program heavily emphasizing technical subjects. In 1981 a national program introduced [[computer]]s to most of the ESPUs.<ref name=\"Education\"/>\n\n=== Foreign ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-K0615-0001-141, Berlin, VIII.

Zhivkov was awarded the [[Hero of the Soviet Union]] in 1977.<ref>{{in lang|ru}} [http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=2164 Biography] at the website on Heroes of the Soviet Union and Russia</ref> Yet, though Bulgarian ''\u00e9migr\u00e9'' dissident [[Georgi Markov]] wrote that \"[Zhivkov] served the Soviet Union more ardently than the Soviet leaders themselves did,\" in many ways he can be said to have exploited the USSR for political purposes, with Bulgaria serving a buffer between the USSR and NATO. Thus, he claims in his memoirs that the USSR had become \"a raw material appendage to Bulgaria,\" something obliquely confirmed by Gorbachev when he wrote in his memoirs that \"Bulgaria was a country which had lived beyond its means for a long time.\" An example of how the \"raw material appendage\" was exploited was the trade in Soviet [[crude oil]]. This would be shipped to Bulgaria's modern [[Oil refinery|refinery]] in [[Burgas]] at subsidized prices, processed, and resold on world markets at a huge premium.\n\nIn 1963 and 1973, the Zhivkov regime made requests \u2014 it is unclear how far these were in earnest \u2014 that\nBulgaria be incorporated into the USSR, both times because the Bulgarian government, having engaged in\nbitter polemics with [[Yugoslavia]] over the [[Macedonia naming dispute]], feared a Soviet\u2013Yugoslav reconciliation at its own expense. In 1963, following the decision of [[Patriarch Alexy I of Moscow]] to recognize the autonomy of the [[Macedonian Orthodox Church]], the Bulgarian leaders openly declared that there was no \"historic Macedonian nation.\" In the face of Moscow's post-1953 efforts to reach out to Belgrade and Athens, Zhivkov seems to have calculated that a policy of unswerving loyalty to the Kremlin would ensure that it remained more valuable for the USSR than non-aligned Yugoslavia or NATO-affiliated Greece.<ref>Bal\u00e1zs Szalontai, Political and Economic Relations between Communist States. In: Stephen Anthony Smith (ed.), ''Oxford Handbook in the History of Communism'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2014), p. 314.</ref>\n\nThroughout the 1960s and 1970s, Bulgaria gave official military support to many national liberation causes, most notably in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, ([[North Vietnam]]), [[Guided Democracy in Indonesia|Indonesia]], [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi|Libya]], [[People's Republic of Angola|Angola]], Afghanistan, the [[Horn of Africa]], and the [[Middle East]]. In 1984 the 9,000 Bulgarian advisers stationed in Libya for military and nonmilitary aid put that country in first place among Bulgaria's [[Third World]] clients. Through its Kintex arms export enterprise, Bulgaria also engaged in covert military support activities, many of which were subsequently disclosed. In the 1970s, diplomatic crises with [[Sudan]] and [[Egypt]] were triggered by Bulgarian involvement in coup plots.<ref name=\"Affairs\"/>\n\nUnder Zhivkov Bulgaria's policy toward [[Western Europe]] and the [[United States]] was determined largely by the position of the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"Western Europe\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0193) Western Europe and the US], Library of Congress</ref> Events such as the invasions of Czechoslovakia and [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]] automatically distanced Bulgaria from the West; then, in the early 1980s Soviet efforts to split NATO by cultivating Western Europe brought Bulgaria closer to [[France]] and [[West Germany]] - a position that continued through the 1980s. Even back in the 1970s, Zhivkov actively pursued better relations with the West, overcoming conservative opposition and the tentative, tourism-based approach to the West taken as early as the 1960s.<ref name=\"Affairs\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0066) Foreign Affairs in the 1960s-70s], Library of Congress</ref> Emulating Soviet d\u00e9tente policy of the 1970s, Bulgaria gained Western technology, expanded cultural contacts, and attracted Western investments with the most liberal foreign investment policy in Eastern Europe.<ref name=\"Affairs\"/> As in 1956 and 1968, however, Soviet actions altered Bulgaria's position. The [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]] in late 1979, which Bulgaria supported vigorously, renewed tension between Bulgaria and the West. Alleged Bulgarian implication in the attempted assassination of Pope [[John Paul II]] in 1981 exacerbated the problem and kept relations cool through the early 1980s.<ref name=\"Affairs\"/> A 1988 application for membership in the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] was refused because of the Turkish assimilation program, after widespread expectations of success.<ref name=\"Western Europe\"/>\n\nBulgarian relations with Greece, a traditional enemy, were stable throughout the 1970s and 1980s, in spite of major government changes in both countries. Zhivkov made this stability a model for the overall Balkan cooperation that was a centerpiece of his foreign policy in the 1980s.<ref name=\"Greece\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0190) Greece]</ref> In 1986 the two countries signed a declaration of good-neighborliness, friendship, and cooperation that was based on mutual enmity toward Turkey and toward Yugoslav demands for recognition of [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonian]] minorities in Bulgaria and Greece. An important motivation for friendship with Greece was to exploit [[NATO]]'s Greek-Turkish split, which was based on the claims of the two countries in [[Cyprus]]. In early 1989, Bulgaria signed a ten-year bilateral economic agreement with Greece.<ref name=\"Greece\"/>\n\n=== Cultural ===\n\nUntil the late 1980s, Zhivkov successfully prevented unrest in the Bulgarian intellectual community.<ref name=\"Inteligentsia\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0181) Zhivkov and the Intelligentsia], Library of Congress</ref> Membership in the writers' union brought enormous privilege and social stature, and that drew many dissident writers such as Georgi Dzhagarov and Lyubomir Levchev into the circle of the officially approved intelligentsia. On the other hand, entry required intellectual compromise, and refusal to compromise led to dismissal from the union and loss of all privileges. The punishment of dissident writers sometimes went far beyond loss of privileges. In 1978 \u00e9migr\u00e9 writer [[Georgi Markov]] was murdered in London for his anticommunist broadcasts for the British Broadcasting Corporation, and [[Blaga Dimitrova]] was harshly denounced for her critical portrayal of party officials in her 1982 novel ''Litse''.<ref name=\"Inteligentsia\"/>\n\nZhivkov also softened organized opposition by restoring symbols of the Bulgarian cultural past that had been cast aside in the postwar campaign to consolidate Soviet-style party control. Beginning in 1967, he appealed loudly to the people to remember \"our motherland Bulgaria\".<ref name=\"Inteligentsia\"/> In the late 1970s, Zhivkov mended relations with the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church]].<ref name=\"Inteligentsia\"/> Zhivkov's extensive campaign of cultural restoration provided at least some common ground between him and the Bulgarian intelligentsia. In 1980 Zhivkov had improved his domestic position by appointing his daughter [[Lyudmila Zhivkova]] as chair of the commission on science, culture, and art.<ref name=\"Athmosphere\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0068) The Political Atmosphere in the 1970s], Library of Congress</ref> In this powerful position, Zhivkova became extremely popular by promoting Bulgaria's separate national cultural heritage. She spent large sums of money in a highly visible campaign to support scholars, collect Bulgarian art, and sponsor cultural institutions. Among her policies was closer cultural contact with the West; her most visible project was the spectacular national celebration of [[1300th Anniversary of the Bulgarian State|Bulgaria's 1,300th anniversary]] in 1981. When Zhivkova died in 1981, relations with the West had already been chilled by the Afghanistan issue, but her brief administration of Bulgaria's official cultural life was a successful phase of her father's appeal to Bulgarian national tradition to bind the country together.<ref name=\"Athmosphere\"/>\n\nSports also prospered during Zhivkov's rule. From 1956 to 1988, Bulgaria won an unprecedented 153 Olympic medals and numerous European and world competitions in sports as diverse as [[volleyball]], [[rhythmic gymnastics]] and [[wrestling]].\n\n== Dissent and human rights violations ==\n\nDissent was punished under Zhivkov's rule. The CSS was a feared tool of control, and overt opposition largely stayed underground until the late 1980s. In 1978, the Bulgarian dissident [[Georgi Markov]] was assassinated in London by an agent who stabbed him with an umbrella tip which implanted a very small [[ricin]] ball. According to former [[KGB]] [[general]] [[Oleg Kalugin]], this was requested by Zhivkov and either performed by the [[KGB]] or it assisted the CSS; the actual assassin is reputed to have been [[Francesco Gullino]], working for the CSS. In Zhivkov's time, Bulgarians found it extremely difficult to travel abroad.\n\nZhivkov was particularly intolerant of dissent within the Party.  When [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] announced his reform program, Zhivkov made a show of copying it, believing that Gorbachev wasn't really serious about ''[[glasnost]]'' or ''[[perestroika]].''<ref name=Revolution1989>{{cite book|last=Sebetsyen|first=Victor|title=Revolution 1989: The Fall of the Soviet Empire|publisher=[[Pantheon Books]]|location=New York City|year=2009|isbn=0-375-42532-2|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/revolution1989fa00sebe}}</ref>  However, he showed his true colors when he expelled several members of a human-rights watch group from the Party. Soon afterward, when several intellectuals announced the formation of the \"Club for the Support of Perestroika and Glasnost,\" he arrested the leaders and threw them out of the Party.<ref name=Thompson>{{cite book |title=The World Today Series: Nordic, Central and Southeastern Europe 2008|last=Thompson |first=Wayne C. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2008 |publisher=Stryker-Post Publications |location=Harpers Ferry, West Virginia |ISBN=978-1-887985-95-6}}</ref>\n\n<!-- Unreferenced section : == Nepotism and insistence on ''predanost'' ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\nZhivkov married Mara Maleeva (1911\u20131971) in 1938. They had two children, both would be promoted in the BCP hierarchy, daughter [[Lyudmila Zhivkova]] and son Vladimir Zhivkov. Lyudmila became a Politburo member and earned the ire of the BCP and Bulgaria's benefactors in [[Moscow]] with her unorthodox artistic ideas and practice of Eastern religions. She died abruptly at the age of 38 in 1981. Her health was severely compromised by stress, failed marriages, and unusual dietary/lifestyle practices, although rumours of assassination or suicide abounded. With Lyudmila's death, her friends and supporters were quickly removed from all positions of power. Son-in-law [[Ivan Slavkov]] was made chairman of Bulgaria's state television company and later became president of the [[Bulgarian Olympic Committee]].\n\nApart from promoting his family, Zhivkov instituted a complex system of privileges which extended to former Resistance figures, Party members and ''prominenti'' of the sciences, arts and manufacture. In the early 1960s, he was instrumental in constructing a large set of housing, financial, educational, electoral and other benefits to be granted to a large category of people called \"Active Fighters against Capitalism and Fascism\" who had ostensibly been members of the rather modest Bulgarian Wartime resistance and which was expanded to absurd proportions. Without necessarily receiving great remuneration (pay differentials under Zhivkov were within the 5:1 range, with the overwhelming majority of salaries being within the 3:1 range), Party members and CSS informers received very significant perquisites which involved access to accommodation, luxury imported goods, hard currency, the ability to travel abroad, superior medical and dental treatment and unhindered entry to higher education for their children. The scope of these privileges broadened as they rose in the Party hierarchy. Eminent artists, scientists and \"Heroes of Socialist Labour\" (mostly collective farmers and shop-floor workers) received similar privileges. Established in the early years of Zhivkov's terms in power, [[Corecom]] was a retail chain in which foreigners could shop with hard currency, but its main customers were privileged Bulgarians close to the Zhivkov regime.\n\nIn Zhivkov's Bulgaria, money had lost many of its traditional properties, being replaced by sets of complex personal and family material and career considerations which have been described as \"feudal\". This hampered the prosecution in post-Zhivkov fraud and corruption trials, since no venality could be proved against those charged: they had merely received goods in kind and services which moreover had been their \"legal due\".\n\nZhivkov reserved a special attention for his birthplace of [[Pravets]]. In the 1960s this small village was declared \"an Urban Community,\" becoming a town a decade later. In 1982 Bulgaria's first Apple clone personal computer was named the ''Pravets''. The grateful citizens of Pravets responded by erecting a heroic statue to Zhivkov which he duly had taken down, ostensibly to prevent a personal cult growing around him. It was re-erected after his death.\n\nThroughout his tenure of power, Zhivkov surrounded himself with those who exhibited ''predanost'' (loyalty, devotion, the desire to proffer all). In his reminiscences, Vladimir Kostov, a Bulgarian secret agent who defected to [[France]] in 1978, recalls how the powerful minister of internal affairs would suffer nervous episodes before meeting Zhivkov lest his ''predanost'' should fail to come across sufficiently expressively..-->\n\n== Image ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\nThroughout his tenure, Zhivkov's [[dialect]] and poor manners made him the butt of many acerbic jibes and jokes in Bulgaria's urbane circles. While the feared CSS secret police was commonly said to persecute those who told political jokes, Zhivkov himself was said to have found them amusing and \"collected\" an archive of them. His popular nickname was \"bai Tosho\" (approximately \"Ol' Uncle Tosho\") or occasionally (and later) \"Tato\" (a dialectal word for [[Father|\"Dad\" or \"Pop\"]]). Markov tells a story of how Zhivkov reproached a popular newspaper cartoonist for modifying his signature to resemble a pig's tail, yet did not persecute him. A handful of satirist dissidents such as [[Radoy Ralin]] enjoyed some prominence, although Ralin was not favored by the authorities due to his sharp satire.\n\nZhivkov survived the [[Sino-Soviet split]], Khrushchev's fall in October 1964, an attempted Stalinist-Maoist ''[[Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat attempt of 1965|coup d\u2019\u00e9tat]]'' in 1965, his daughter [[Lyudmila Zhivkova]]'s death in 1981, [[Death and funeral of Leonid Brezhnev|Brezhnev's death]] in 1982, and [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s post-1985 reforms.\n\n== Fall ==\n\nIn December 1984, Todor Zhivkov began a campaign of forcible assimilation of Bulgaria's Turkish minority, most notably forcing all Turks to take Bulgarian names. By 1989, resistance to this policy led to riots, which resulted in multiple deaths. In May 1989, Zhivkov ordered an expulsion of Turks (and Muslims) to Turkey across the then [[Iron Curtain]] boundary between these two countries. This led to the largest [[ethnic cleansing]] in Europe during the [[Cold War]], in which over 360,000 Turks (and Muslims) were targeted within three months.<ref>See:'2. \u041e\u0431\u044f\u0432\u044f\u0432\u0430\u043c\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0433\u043e\u043d\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0434 360 000 \u0431\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438 \u043e\u0442 \u0442\u0443\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0437\u0445\u043e\u0434 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0437 1989 \u0433. \u0437\u0430 \u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0435\u0442\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0447\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0435, \u0438\u0437\u0432\u044a\u0440\u0448\u0435\u043d\u043e \u043e\u0442 \u0442\u043e\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0440\u0435\u0436\u0438\u043c.'

Bulgaria was the target of near-unanimous condemnation from the international community; even the Soviets protested. Gorbachev already did not think much of Zhivkov; he had lumped Zhivkov in with a group of inflexible hardliners that included [[East Germany]]'s [[Erich Honecker]], [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia's]] [[Gust\u00e1v Hus\u00e1k]] and [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania's]] [[Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu]].  However, after the Turkish episode, he was determined to see Zhivkov gone.  The Turkish affair also alarmed several high-ranking Bulgarian officials as well, including [[Prime Minister of Bulgaria|Prime Minister]] [[Georgi Atanasov (politician)|Georgi Atanasov]], Foreign Minister [[Petar Mladenov]] and Finance Minister [[Andrey Lukanov]].  They began plotting to remove him, but had to move discreetly given the ubiquity of the CSS.<ref name=Revolution1989/>\n\nIn October 1989, Mladenov organised a [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|CSCE]] environmental summit in Sofia.  He invited an independent group of Bulgarian environmental activists, Ecoglasnost, to participate.  Ten days into the conference, several Ecoglasnost activists and supporters were brutally beaten up by CSS and militia officers\u2014on orders from Zhivkov.  They then collared 36 other opposition activists, drove them to the countryside and forced them to walk back to Sofia.  Amid near-unanimous international condemnation, Mladenov, Lukanov and Atanasov decided that Zhivkov had to go.  In a critical step, they convinced Defence Minister [[Dobri Dzhurov]] to support them.<ref name=Revolution1989/><ref name=Thompson/>\n\nThe plotters struck on 9 November, a day before a Politburo meeting.  Dzhurov met Zhivkov in private and told him that he needed to resign, and there was enough support on the Politburo to vote him out. Zhivkov was taken by surprise and tried to marshal support, to no avail. Just before the Politburo met on 10 November, Dzhurov gave Zhivkov an ultimatum\u2013unless Zhivkov resigned, the Politburo would not only vote him out, but have him executed. Seeing the writing on the wall after the motion calling for his removal passed, Zhivkov resigned, officially for reasons of age and health. Mladenov was elected his successor. On 17 November the National Assembly removed him from the post of Chairman of the State Council, replacing him with Mladenov.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/18/world/clamor-east-bulgarian-leader-hints-future-free-voting-other-changes.html|title=Bulgarian Leader Hints at Free Voting and Other Changes|last=Haberman|first=Clyde|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=1989-11-18}}</ref><ref name=Revolution1989/><ref name=Thompson/>\n\nOn 11 December, only a month after Zhivkov's ouster, Mladenov called for the Communist Party to give up its guaranteed right to rule.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/12/world/upheaval-east-bulgaria-s-communist-chief-plans-relax-grip-hold-elections.html|title=Bulgaria's Communist Chief Plans To Relax Grip and Hold Elections|last=Haberman|first=Clyde|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=1989-12-12}}</ref> The Central Committee fell into line two days later, calling for free elections in the spring and asking the National Assembly to delete the portions of the Constitution that enshrined the party's \"leading role\".<ref name=expel>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/14/world/upheaval-in-the-east-communists-in-bulgaria-expel-zhivkov.html|title=Communists in Bulgaria Expel Zhivkov|last=Haberman|first=Clyde|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=1989-12-14}}</ref>  On 15 January, the National Assembly struck out the portions of the constitution giving the Communist Party a monopoly of power.  Thus, within only two months of Zhivkov losing power, the Communist system he had dominated for 33 years was no more.<ref name=Revolution1989/><ref name=Thompson/>\n\nWhile he was initially shown reverence in public upon removal, that had changed by 17 November, when he was sharply criticized in parliament. On 13 December, Zhivkov was expelled from the party for what Lukanov described as \"gross violations of laws and gross mistakes in politics\".<ref name=expel/> Mladenov contended that Zhivkov's stewardship had left the country in \"a near heart-attack condition\".<ref name=expel/> The party also began an investigation into Zhivkov's high living.\n\nAfter being placed under house arrest on 18 January 1990, on 25 February 1991, Zhivkov was brought to stand trial on charges of [[embezzling]] the equivalent of $24 million (in 1990 dollars) in government funds. There had been calls to try him for political crimes as well, but prosecutors balked, believing they did not have enough evidence to convict him. On 4 September 1992 after an 18-month trial, he was convicted of embezzlement and sentenced to seven years in prison.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/05/world/ousted-bulgarian-gets-7-year-term-for-embezzlement.html|title=Ousted Bulgarian Gets 7-Year Term For Embezzlement|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=1992-09-05}}</ref> Due to old age and heart problems, he was allowed to serve his term under [[house arrest]] at his granddaughter's home. Following his appeal, he was acquitted of the embezzlement charge by the Bulgarian Supreme Court on 9 February 1996. He was also acquitted of the charge of abuse of office on 28 August, though he still remained under indictment for human rights violations, eventually being released from house arrest in September 1997.

Like the Soviet Bloc in the face of the [[Council for Mutual Economic Assistance]] (SEV, Comecon), the [[Warsaw Pact Organization]] and the USSR itself collapsed, by 1992 Bulgaria entered a period of transition from socialism to a free market economy and democracy. The country's political ideology and foreign policies of Zhivkov's era have thus been reversed.\n\nZhivkov's onslaught on Bulgaria's Muslims and Turks radicalized and united what had been scattered and quiescent minorities. Since 2001 (and also from 1991 to 1994) the DPS ([[Movement for Rights and Freedoms]]) party, composed almost entirely of Bulgarian Turks, has held the balance of power in Bulgarian politics. Thus, one of the major Zhivkov projects produced the very opposite effect of what had been intended.\n\nA most damaging process, which emerged during the early years of Zhivkov's rule, was the \"demographic problem\" which saw traditionally large Bulgarian village families emigrate to industrial cities where they tended to have one child or none at all. The reforms undertaken during Zhivkov's regime consisted mostly of fines for families without children and limiting abortion.\n\n===Economic===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\nOn the other hand, after very significant reverses and difficulties in the 1940s and 1950s, the Bulgarian economy developed apace from the mid-1960s until the late 1970s. Most of today's large industrial facilities such as the [[Kremikovtsi]] steelworks and the Chervena Mogila engineering works were built under Zhivkov. Bulgaria's nuclear power station, [[AEC Kozloduy]], was built in the 1970s, all six large reactors commissioned in under five years. This, and Bulgaria's many coal-fired and hydroelectric power stations, made the country a major electric power exporter. By the 1970s, the focus switched to high technologies such as electronics and even space exploration: on 10 April 1979 Bulgaria launched the first of two ''kosmonavti'' (cosmonauts), [[Georgi Ivanov (cosmonaut)|Georgi Ivanov]], aboard Soviet ''[[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz]]'' spaceships and later launched its own space satellites. Having been among the first nations to market electronic calculators (the [[ELKA]] brand, since 1973) and digital watches ([[Elektronika]], since 1975), in 1982 the country launched its [[Pravetz series 8|Pravets]] personal computer (a near-\"[[Apple II]] clone\") for business and domestic use. In the mid-1960s an economic reform package was introduced, which allowed for farmers to freely sell their overplanned production. Shortly after that Bulgaria became the first and only Eastern Bloc country which locally produced [[Coca-Cola]]. Mass tourism developed under Zhivkov's direction from the early 1960s onwards.\n\nHowever, this Bulgarian economy was exceptionally susceptible to Soviet largesse and Soviet-bloc markets. After the Soviet crude oil price shock of 1979, it entered a very severe recession from which it hardly recovered in the 1980s. After the early-1990s loss of Soviet and Comecon markets, this economy (unused to competing in a free market environment) entered prolonged and significant contraction. Zhivkov-era industrial facilities were largely unattractive to investors, many being left to decay. Great numbers of specialist personnel retired and died without being replaced, or else emigrated or left their state jobs for more lucrative private employment. As agriculture declined, tourism has emerged as almost the sole Zhivkov-era industrial survivor. It is however widely regarded that incompetent administration after 1989 had a much greater effect on the decline of the economy, as even successful industries declined.\n\n==Honours and awards==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\n;Bulgaria\n* {{Flagicon|People's Republic of Bulgaria|1971}} [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]: [[Order of Georgi Dimitrov]]\n* {{Flagicon|People's Republic of Bulgaria|1971}} [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]: [[Hero of Socialist Labour|Hero of Socialist Labour (Bulgaria)]]\n* {{Flagicon|People's Republic of Bulgaria|1971}} [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]: [[Hero of the People's Republic of Bulgaria]]\n* {{Flagicon|People's Republic of Bulgaria|1971}} [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]: Grand Master of the [[Order of Saints Cyril and Methodius|Order of Cyril and Methodius]]\n\n;Foreign\n* {{Flag|Soviet Union}}: [[Gold Star]] [[Hero of the Soviet Union]] (No. 11281) (31 May 1977 - for his contribution to the fight against fascism in the Second World War)\n* {{Flag|Soviet Union}}: Two [[Orders of Lenin]]\n* {{Flag|Portugal}}: Grand Collar of the [[Order of Infante Dom Henrique]] (21 August 1979)\n* {{Flag|Cuba}}: [[Order of Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Commons category|Todor Zhivkov}}\n{{Wikiquote}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{S-start}}\n{{s-off}}\n{{Succession box| before = [[Georgi Traikov]] (as chairman of the National Assembly Presidium)| title = [[List of Presidents of Bulgaria|Chairman of the State Council]]|years=7 July 1971 \u2013 17 November 1989| after = [[Petar Mladenov]]}}\n{{Succession box|title=[[List of Prime Ministers of Bulgaria|Prime Minister of Bulgaria]] |before=[[Anton Yugov]]|after= [[Stanko Todorov]]|years=19 November 1962 \u2013 7 July 1971}}\n{{s-ppo}}\n{{Succession box| before = [[Vulko Chervenkov]]| title = [[Bulgarian Communist Party|General Secretary of the Bulgarian Communist Party]]|years=4 March 1954 \u2013 10 November 1989| after = [[Petar Mladenov]]}}\n{{S-end}}\n{{BulgarianPresidents}}\n{{BulgarianPrimeMinisters}}\n{{Leaders of the Ruling Parties of the Eastern Bloc}}\n{{Fall of Communism}}\n{{Cold War}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Zhivkov, Todor}}\n[[Category:1911 births]]\n[[Category:1998 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Pravets]]\n[[Category:Bulgarian Communist Party politicians]]\n[[Category:Bulgarian Socialist Party politicians]]\n[[Category:20th-century Bulgarian politicians]]\n[[Category:Bulgarian anti-fascists]]\n[[Category:Bulgarian atheists]]\n[[Category:Bulgarian communists]]\n[[Category:Collaborators with the Soviet Union]]\n[[Category:Heroes of the Soviet Union]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Order of Georgi Dimitrov]]\n[[Category:Heroes of the People's Republic of Bulgaria]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Order of Lenin]]\n[[Category:Grand Collars of the Order of Prince Henry]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Order of Jos\u00e9 Marti]]\n[[Category:Mayors of Sofia]]\n[[Category:Prime Ministers of Bulgaria]]\n[[Category:Bulgarian resistance members]]\n[[Category:Communist rulers]]\n[[Category:Burials at Central Sofia Cemetery]]\n[[Category:Former Bulgarian Orthodox Christians]]\n[[Category:Deaths from pneumonia]]\n[[Category:Foreign Heroes of the Soviet Union]]\n[[Category:Heads of regimes who were later imprisoned]]\n[[Category:Politicians convicted of embezzlement]]\n", "name_user": "Apdency", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eImage and Approval ratings", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todor_Zhivkov"}

He was raised as a British Israelite, and his father introduced him to [[J. H. Allen]]'s work ''Judah's Sceptre and Joseph's Birthright'' (1902) at an early age.<ref>''Race Over Grace: The Racialist Religion of the Christian Identity Movement'', Charles H. Roberts, p. 9</ref> While Rand's father was not an antisemite, nor was Rand in his early British Israelite years, Rand first added an antisemitic element to British Israelism in the 1920s. He claimed as early as 1924 that the Jews were not really descended from the [[tribe of Judah]], but were instead the descendants of [[Esau]] or [[Canaanites]].<ref>Barkun, pp. 45\u201354.</ref> However, Rand never claimed that modern Jews were descendants of Satan, or that they were in any way inferior; he just claimed that they were not the true lineal descendants of Judah.<ref>Barkun, pp. 45\u201360.</ref> For this reason Rand is considered a 'transitional' figure from British Israelism to Christian Identity, but not its actual founder.<ref>Charles H. Roberts, p. 9</ref>\n\nIn early 1930, Rand met [[William J. Cameron]] in Detroit to establish a branch of the Anglo-Saxon Federation of America. Detroit became the organization's first headquarters and its first convention was held there in May 1930. <ref>Barkun, p. 30.</ref>\n\n===Growth===\nSoon after the initial convention in Detroit, growth of the Federation occurred rapidly. There was a state convention in California in September 1930, and an Oregon branch was formed in 1931. The group's second convention was held in Chicago in 1931. It was at this convention that Rand announced the federation had aquired the unsold works of [[C. A. L. Totten]] along with their printing plates. Following the second convention, new branches of the Anglo-Saxon Federation of America were established in Chicago, St. Petersburg, Florida, and Miami. By that time, the Pacific Coast District included California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Nevada, and Utah.<ref>Barkun, p. 30.</ref>\n\nRand was primarily an organizer, while Cameron, having been editor of [[Henry Ford|Henry Ford's]] [[The Dearborn Independent]], brought with him the clout and connection to powerful business and political leaders. According to [[Michael Barkun]], the two men working together \"facilitated the first systematic attempt to link British-Israel religious ideas with the political right.\"<ref>Barkun, p. 31</ref> In September 1931, Cameron encouraged Rand to publish a special issue of the federation's newsletter to send to \"the leading men of this country.\"<ref>Barkun, p. 31</ref> The two met with Rand's acquaintance Fred R. Marvin, a political operator who provided them a mailing list for the American Coalition of Patriotic Societies. Rand wrote and published the special issue, which Cameron financed, to be distributed by the their list. \"The special issue came out in a printing of thirty thousand the following February, so that Rand\u2019s British-Israel message could blanket the American right in the darkest days of the Depression.\"<ref>Barkun, p. 31</ref>\n\n===Peak and Decline===\nBy the 1930s and 1940s, several groups affiliated with the federation could be found throughout the United States. After a split between Rand and Cameron, in 1938 the group's headquarters were moved from Detroit to Haverhill, MA, where Rand lived.<ref>Barkun, p. 41</ref>\n\nThe organization's framework decayed rapidly following World War II. The only branch to survive into the 1960s was in Portland, Oregon and it stopped publishing a newsletter in mid-1964.<ref>Barkun, p. 43</ref>\n\nBy the mid-1970s, most of the group's membership had either died or left the group.<ref name=\"Lewis\"></ref> Its magazine, ''Destiny Magazine'', ceased monthly publication in 1969, publishing quarterly until 1970. Rand continued publishing an \"Editorial Letter\" until 1983.<ref>Barkun, p. 43</ref>\n\nThe group still remains active, publishing books and accepting new members.\n\n==Beliefs==\nThe group asserts that the [[Bible]] contains the past, present, and future history of Israel.\n\nThe group also believes that the Bible determines exactly which group should take the name \"Israel\" based on which nation or race best fulfills the promises God made in the [[Old Testament]]. The Bible states that Israel was to be a powerful nation located to the northwest of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] that holds a great heathen empire in domination, is the chief missionary power in the world, and is immune to defeat in war. The Bible also mentions a group which split itself off from the parent \"Israel\" to become a great nation in its own right. The federation concludes that the only nation which meets the above criteria was [[Great Britain]], and, by extension, the [[United States]] which separated itself from Great Britain later.\n\n==Influence on Christian Identity==\nRand is considered the first person to coin the term 'Christian Identity'.<ref>''The Phinehas Priesthood: Violent Vanguard of the Christian Identity Movement'', Danny W. Davis, 2010, p. 18</ref> The Anglo-Saxon Federation of America promoted Rand's view that Jews were not descended from Judah; this marked the first key transition from British Israelism to Christian Identity. Beginning in May 1937, there were key meetings of British Israelites in the United States who were attracted to Rand\u2019s theory that the Jews were not descended from Judah. This provided a catalyst for the eventual emergence of Christian Identity.<ref>Charles H.

The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey; the winner of this classification is considered the winner of the Tour.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|pp=452\u2013453}}\n\nAdditionally, there was a [[points classification in the Tour de France|points classification]], where cyclists were given points for finishing among the best in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints. The cyclist with the most points led the classification, and was identified with a green jersey.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|pp=453\u2013454}} The system for the [[points classification in the Tour de France|points classification]] was changed for the 1987 Tour: in previous years, more points were earned in flat stages than in mountain stages, which gave sprinters an advantage in this classification; in 1984 all stages gave 25 points for the winner.<ref name=\"kbnl\">{{cite news|url=http://kranten.kb.nl/view/article/id/ddd%3A010962071%3Ampeg21%3Ap021%3Aa0310|title=Ruim ton voor winnaar|language=Dutch|publisher=Koninklijke Bibliotheek|work=Het Vrije Volk|date=28 June 1985|page=21|accessdate=29 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nThere was also a [[mountains classification in the Tour de France|mountains classification]].

The cyclist with the most points led the classification, and wore a white jersey with red [[polka dot]]s.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|p=454}}\n\nThe combination jersey for the [[Combination classification in the Tour de France|combination classification]] was introduced in 1985.<ref name=\"kbnl\" /> This classification was calculated as a combination of the other classifications.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|pp=454\u2013455}}\n\nAnother classification was the [[young rider classification in the Tour de France|young rider classification]]. This was decided the same way as the general classification, but only riders that rode the Tour for the first time were eligible, and the leader wore a white jersey.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|pp=454\u2013455}}\n\nThe sixth individual classification was the [[intermediate sprints classification in the Tour de France|intermediate sprints classification]]. This classification had similar rules as the points classification, but only points were awarded on intermediate sprints. Its leader wore a red jersey.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|p=455}}\n\nFor the [[Team classification in the Tour de France|team classification]], the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time. The riders in the team that led this classification were identified by yellow [[Casquette|caps]].{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|p=455}} There was also a team points classification. Cyclists received points according to their finishing position on each stage, with the first rider receiving one point. The first three finishers of each team had their points combined, and the team with the fewest points led the classification. The riders of the team leading this classification wore green caps.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|p=455}}\n\nIn addition, there was a [[Combativity award in the Tour de France|combativity award]], in which a jury composed of journalists gave points after each [[Mass start|mass-start]] stage to the cyclist they considered most combative. The split stages each had a combined winner.{{sfn|van den Akker|2018|pp=211\u2013216}} At the conclusion of the Tour, Maarten Ducrot won the overall super-combativity award, also decided by journalists.{{sfn|Augendre|2016|p=76}} The [[Souvenir Henri Desgrange]] was given in honour of Tour founder [[Henri Desgrange]] to the first rider to pass the summit of the [[Col du Tourmalet]] on stage 17.

Following the time trial on the penultimate day, he publicly stated in an interview with French cycling magazine ''Miroir du Cyclisme'': \"I'll stir things up to help Greg win, and I'll have fun doing it. That's a promise.\"{{sfn|Moore|2011|p=168}} On the victory podium in Paris, he leaned over to LeMond, telling him: \"Next year, it's you\", repeating the pledge again during the celebration dinner of {{ct|LVC|1985|nolink=yes}} that same evening.{{sfn|de Vis\u00e9|2019|pp=128\u2013129}} Public opinion saw Hinault and LeMond as good friends. The sports newspaper ''[[L'Equipe]]'' ran a cartoon on the day of the final stage, showing Hinault on a bicycle and LeMond next to him on a child's scooter, with Hinault saying \"Because you've been so good, I'll take you along next year on my handlebars\", to which LeMond replied: \"Thanks, Uncle Bernard.\"{{sfn|Abt|1990|p=96}} His first Tour victory the following year did not come to LeMond as easily as these pledges and jokes indicated. Hinault attacked several times during the [[1986 Tour de France]], only conceding defeat after the last time trial.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2008|pp=162\u2013170}} LeMond was frustrated with the apparent unwillingness by Hinault to honour the deal, saying: \"He made promises to me he never intended to keep. He made them just to relieve the pressure on himself.\"{{sfn|Van Gucht|2015|p=186}}\n\nIn previous years, cyclists tied their shoes to their pedals with toe-clips, allowing them to not only push the pedals down but also pull them up. In 1985, Hinault had used [[Bicycle pedal#Clipless pedals|clip-ins (clipless pedals)]], which allowed the shoes to snap into the pedal. His victory in this Tour made these clip-ins popular.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZdXCmwpk-SAC&pg=PA157|page=157|title=Historical Dictionary of Cycling|first1=Jeroen|last1=Heijmans|last2=Mallon|first2=Bill|year=2011|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-7175-5|series=Historical dictionaries of sports}}</ref>\n\nThere was some criticism that the time trials were too important.

Following the time trial on the penultimate day, he publicly stated in an interview with French cycling magazine ''Miroir du Cyclisme'': \"I'll stir things up to help Greg win, and I'll have fun doing it. That's a promise.\"{{sfn|Moore|2011|p=168}} On the victory podium in Paris, he leaned over to LeMond, telling him: \"Next year, it's you\", repeating the pledge again during the celebration dinner of {{ct|LVC|1985|nolink=yes}} that same evening.{{sfn|de Vis\u00e9|2019|pp=128\u2013129}} Public opinion saw Hinault and LeMond as good friends. The sports newspaper ''[[L'Equipe]]'' ran a cartoon on the day of the final stage, showing Hinault on a bicycle and LeMond next to him on a child's scooter, with Hinault saying \"Because you've been so good, I'll take you along next year on my handlebars\", to which LeMond replied: \"Thanks, Uncle Bernard.\"{{sfn|Abt|1990|p=96}} His first Tour victory the following year did not come to LeMond as easily as these pledges and jokes indicated. Hinault attacked several times during the [[1986 Tour de France]], only conceding defeat after the last time trial.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2008|pp=162\u2013170}} LeMond was frustrated with the apparent unwillingness by Hinault to honour the deal, saying: \"He made promises to me he never intended to keep. He made them just to relieve the pressure on himself.\"{{sfn|Van Gucht|2015|p=186}}\n\nIn previous years, cyclists tied their shoes to their pedals with toe-clips, allowing them to not only push the pedals down but also pull them up. In 1985, Hinault had used [[Bicycle pedal#Clipless pedals|clip-ins (clipless pedals)]], which allowed the shoes to snap into the pedal. His victory in this Tour made these clip-ins popular.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZdXCmwpk-SAC&pg=PA157|page=157|title=Historical Dictionary of Cycling|first1=Jeroen|last1=Heijmans|last2=Mallon|first2=Bill|year=2011|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-7175-5|series=Historical dictionaries of sports}}</ref>\n\nThere was some criticism that the time trials were too important.
