According to [[radiometric dating]] and other evidence, Earth formed [[Age of the Earth|over 4.5 billion years ago]]. [[Gravity of Earth|Earth's gravity]] interacts with other objects in space, especially the Sun and the [[Moon]], which is Earth's only [[natural satellite]]. Earth [[Earth's orbit|orbits around the Sun]] in 365.256 [[solar time|solar days]], a period known as an Earth [[sidereal year]]. During this time, Earth [[Earth's rotation|rotates about its axis]] 366.256 times, that is, a sidereal year has 366.256 sidereal days.<ref group=\"n\" name=\"sidereal_solar\" />\n\n[[#Axial tilt and seasons|Earth's axis of rotation]] is tilted with respect to its orbital plane, producing [[season]]s on Earth. The [[Gravity|gravitational]] interaction between Earth and the Moon causes [[tide]]s, stabilizes Earth's orientation on its axis, and [[Tidal acceleration|gradually slows its rotation]]. Earth is the densest planet in the [[Solar System]] and the largest and most massive of the four [[terrestrial planet|rocky planet]]s.\n\nEarth's outer layer ([[Lithosphere#Earth's lithosphere|lithosphere]]) is divided into several rigid [[Plate tectonics|tectonic plates]] that migrate across the surface over many millions of years. About 29% of Earth's surface is [[Land#History of land on Earth|land]] consisting of [[continent]]s and [[island]]s. The remaining 71% is [[Water distribution on Earth|covered with water]], mostly by [[ocean]]s but also [[lake]]s, [[river]]s and other [[fresh water]], which all together constitute the [[hydrosphere]]. The majority of [[Polar regions of Earth|Earth's polar regions]] are covered in [[ice]], including the [[Antarctic ice sheet]] and the [[sea ice]] of the [[Arctic ice pack]]. Earth's interior remains active with a solid iron [[Earth's inner core|inner core]], a liquid [[Earth's outer core|outer core]] that generates [[Earth's magnetic field]], and a convecting [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] that drives plate tectonics.\n\nWithin the first billion years of [[History of Earth|Earth's history]], [[Abiogenesis|life appeared in the oceans]] and began to affect [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]] and surface, leading to the proliferation of [[anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] and, [[Great Oxidation Event|later]], [[aerobic organisms]]. Some geological evidence indicates that life may have arisen as early as 4.1&nbsp;billion years ago. Since then, the combination of Earth's distance from the Sun, physical properties and [[Geological history of Earth|geological history]] have allowed life to [[Evolution|evolve]] and thrive. In the [[Timeline of the evolutionary history of life|history of life on Earth]], [[biodiversity]] has gone through long periods of expansion, occasionally punctuated by [[extinction event|mass extinctions]]. Over 99% of all [[species]] that ever lived on Earth are [[extinct]]. Estimates of the [[number of species]] on Earth today vary widely; most species have not been [[Species description|described]]. [[World population|Over 7.7&nbsp;billion humans]] live on Earth and depend on its [[biosphere]] and [[natural resource]]s for their survival.

Three-quarters of the atmosphere's mass is contained within the first {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=on}} of the surface. This lowest layer is called the troposphere. Energy from the Sun heats this layer, and the surface below, causing expansion of the air. This lower-density air then rises and is replaced by cooler, higher-density air. The result is [[atmospheric circulation]] that drives the weather and climate through redistribution of thermal energy.<ref name=\"moran2005\" />\n\nThe primary atmospheric circulation bands consist of the [[trade winds]] in the equatorial region below 30\u00b0 latitude and the [[westerlies]] in the mid-latitudes between 30\u00b0 and 60\u00b0.<ref name=\"berger2002\" /> [[Ocean current]]s are also important factors in determining climate, particularly the [[thermohaline circulation]] that distributes thermal energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions.<ref name=rahmstorf2003 />\n\nWater vapor generated through surface evaporation is transported by circulatory patterns in the atmosphere. When atmospheric conditions permit an uplift of warm, humid air, this water condenses and falls to the surface as precipitation.<ref name=\"moran2005\" /> Most of the water is then transported to lower elevations by river systems and usually returned to the oceans or deposited into lakes. This [[water cycle]] is a vital mechanism for supporting life on land and is a primary factor in the erosion of surface features over geological periods. Precipitation patterns vary widely, ranging from several meters of water per year to less than a millimeter. Atmospheric circulation, topographic features, and temperature differences determine the average precipitation that falls in each region.<ref name=hydrologic_cycle />\n\nThe amount of solar energy reaching Earth's surface decreases with increasing latitude. At higher latitudes, the sunlight reaches the surface at lower angles, and it must pass through thicker columns of the atmosphere. As a result, the mean annual air temperature at sea level decreases by about {{convert|0.4|C-change|F-change|1}} per degree of latitude from the equator.<ref name=sadava_heller2006 /> Earth's surface can be subdivided into specific latitudinal belts of approximately homogeneous climate. Ranging from the equator to the polar regions, these are the [[Tropics|tropical]] (or equatorial), [[Subtropics|subtropical]], [[temperate]] and [[Polar region|polar]] climates.<ref name=climate_zones />\n\nThis latitudinal rule has several anomalies:\n* Proximity to oceans moderates the climate. For example, the [[Scandinavian Peninsula]] has more moderate climate than similarly northern latitudes of [[northern Canada]].\n* The [[wind]] enables this moderating effect. The windward side of a land mass experiences more moderation than the leeward side. In the Northern Hemisphere, the prevailing wind is west-to-east, and western coasts tend to be milder than eastern coasts. This is seen in Eastern North America and Western Europe, where rough continental climates appear on the east coast on parallels with mild climates on the other side of the ocean.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.livescience.com/13573-east-coast-colder-europe-west-coast.html |title=Why U.S. East Coast is colder than Europe's West Coast |publisher=Live Science |date=5 April 2011 |accessdate=7 July 2015}}</ref> In the Southern Hemisphere, the prevailing wind is east-to-west, and the eastern coasts are milder.\n* The distance from Earth to the Sun varies.

Because unfixed [[hydrogen]] has a low [[molecular mass]], it can achieve [[escape velocity]] more readily, and it leaks into outer space at a greater rate than other gases.<ref name=jas31_4_1118 /> The leakage of hydrogen into space contributes to the shifting of Earth's atmosphere and surface from an initially [[redox|reducing]] state to its current [[Redox|oxidizing]] one. Photosynthesis provided a source of free oxygen, but the loss of reducing agents such as hydrogen is thought to have been a necessary precondition for the widespread accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere.<ref name=sci293_5531_839 /> Hence the ability of hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere may have influenced the nature of life that developed on Earth.<ref name=abedon1997 /> In the current, oxygen-rich atmosphere most hydrogen is converted into water before it has an opportunity to escape.

It is about 20&nbsp;light-years above the [[galactic plane]] in the [[Orion Arm]].<ref name=nasa20051201 />\n\n=== Axial tilt and seasons ===\n{{Main|Axial tilt#Earth}}\n[[File:AxialTiltObliquity.png|thumb|right|Earth's axial tilt (or [[obliquity]]) and its relation to the [[rotation]] axis and [[Orbital plane (astronomy)|plane of orbit]]]]\nThe axial tilt of Earth is approximately 23.439281\u00b0<ref name=\"IERS\" /> with the axis of its orbit plane, always pointing towards the [[Celestial Poles]]. Due to Earth's axial tilt, the amount of sunlight reaching any given point on the surface varies over the course of the year. This causes the seasonal change in climate, with [[summer]] in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] occurring when the [[Tropic of Cancer]] is facing the Sun, and [[winter]] taking place when the [[Tropic of Capricorn]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] faces the Sun. During the summer, the day lasts longer, and the Sun climbs higher in the sky. In winter, the climate becomes cooler and the days shorter. In northern temperate latitudes, the Sun rises north of true east during the summer solstice, and sets north of true west, reversing in the winter. The Sun rises south of true east in the summer for the southern temperate zone and sets south of true west.\n\nAbove the [[Arctic Circle]], an extreme case is reached where there is no daylight at all for part of the year, up to six months at the North Pole itself, a [[polar night]]. In the Southern Hemisphere, the situation is exactly reversed, with the [[South Pole]] oriented opposite the direction of the North Pole. Six months later, this pole will experience a [[midnight sun]], a day of 24 hours, again reversing with the South Pole.\n\nBy astronomical convention, the four seasons can be determined by the [[solstice]]s\u2014the points in the orbit of maximum axial tilt toward or away from the Sun\u2014and the [[equinox]]es, when Earth's rotational axis is aligned with its orbital axis. In the Northern Hemisphere, [[winter solstice]] currently occurs around 21 December; [[summer solstice]] is near 21 June, [[March equinox|spring equinox]] is around 20 March and [[September equinox|autumnal equinox]] is about 22 or 23 September. In the Southern Hemisphere, the situation is reversed, with the summer and winter solstices exchanged and the spring and autumnal equinox dates swapped.<ref name=bromberg2008 />\n\nThe angle of Earth's axial tilt is relatively stable over long periods of time. Its axial tilt does undergo [[nutation]]; a slight, irregular motion with a main period of 18.6&nbsp;years.<ref name=lin2006 /> The orientation (rather than the angle) of Earth's axis also changes over time, [[precession|precessing]] around in a complete circle over each 25,800&nbsp;year cycle; this precession is the reason for the difference between a sidereal year and a [[tropical year]]. Both of these motions are caused by the varying attraction of the Sun and the Moon on Earth's equatorial bulge. The poles also migrate a few meters across Earth's surface. This [[polar motion]] has multiple, cyclical components, which collectively are termed [[quasiperiodic motion]]. In addition to an annual component to this motion, there is a 14-month cycle called the [[Chandler wobble]]. Earth's rotational velocity also varies in a phenomenon known as length-of-day variation.<ref name=fisher19960205 />\n\nIn modern times, Earth's [[perihelion]] occurs around 3 January, and its [[aphelion]] around 4 July. These dates change over time due to precession and other orbital factors, which follow cyclical patterns known as [[Milankovitch cycles]]. The changing Earth\u2013Sun distance causes an increase of about 6.9%<ref group=\"n\" name=\"solar_energy\" /> in solar energy reaching Earth at perihelion relative to aphelion. Because the Southern Hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun at about the same time that Earth reaches the closest approach to the Sun, the Southern Hemisphere receives slightly more energy from the Sun than does the northern over the course of a year. This effect is much less significant than the total energy change due to the axial tilt, and most of the excess energy is absorbed by the higher proportion of water in the Southern Hemisphere.<ref name=williams20051230 />\n\nA study from 2016 suggested that [[Planet Nine]] tilted all the planets of the [[Solar System]], including Earth, by about six degrees.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.space.com/34448-planet-nine-solar-system-tilt.html |title=Did the Mysterious 'Planet Nine' Tilt the Solar System? |work=Space.com |first=Charles Q. |last=Choi |date=19 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Habitability ==\n[[File:Moraine Lake 17092005.jpg|thumb|The [[Rocky Mountains]] in Canada overlook [[Moraine Lake]].]]\nA planet that can sustain life is termed [[Planetary habitability|habitable]], even if life did not originate there.

It is the largest moon in the Solar System relative to the size of its planet, although [[Charon (moon)|Charon]] is larger relative to the [[dwarf planet]] [[Pluto]]. The natural satellites of other planets are also referred to as \"moons\", after Earth's.\n\nThe gravitational attraction between Earth and the Moon causes [[tide]]s on Earth. The same effect on the Moon has led to its [[tidal locking]]: its rotation period is the same as the time it takes to orbit Earth. As a result, it always presents the same face to the planet. As the Moon orbits Earth, different parts of its face are illuminated by the Sun, leading to the [[lunar phase]]s; the dark part of the face is separated from the light part by the [[terminator (solar)|solar terminator]].\n[[File:Earth-Moon.svg|thumb|left|Details of the Earth\u2013Moon system, showing the radius of each object and the Earth\u2013Moon [[barycenter]]. The Moon's axis is located by [[Cassini's laws|Cassini's third law]].]]\n\nDue to their [[Tidal acceleration|tidal interaction]], the Moon recedes from Earth at the rate of approximately {{convert|38|mm/yr|in/yr|abbr=on}}. Over millions of years, these tiny modifications\u2014and the lengthening of Earth's day by about 23&nbsp;[[Microsecond|\u00b5s]]/yr\u2014add up to significant changes.<ref name=espenak_meeus20070207 /> During the [[Devonian]] period, for example, (approximately {{val|410|u=Mya}}) there were 400 days in a year, with each day lasting 21.8 hours.<ref>{{cite book |last=Lambeck |first=Kurt |title=The Earth's Variable Rotation: Geophysical Causes and Consequences |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1980 |page=367 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-kiG3uYkoUEC&pg=PA62 |isbn=978-0-521-67330-3}}</ref>\n\nThe Moon may have dramatically affected the development of life by moderating the planet's climate. [[Paleontology|Paleontological]] evidence and computer simulations show that Earth's axial tilt is stabilized by tidal interactions with the Moon.<ref name=aaa428_261 /> Some theorists think that without this stabilization against the [[torque]]s applied by the Sun and planets to Earth's equatorial bulge, the rotational axis might be chaotically unstable, exhibiting chaotic changes over millions of years, as appears to be the case for Mars.<ref name=nature410_6830_773 />\n\nViewed from Earth, the Moon is just far enough away to have almost the same apparent-sized disk as the Sun. The [[angular size]] (or [[solid angle]]) of these two bodies match because, although the Sun's diameter is about 400 times as large as the Moon's, it is also 400 times more distant.<ref name=angular /> This allows total and annular solar eclipses to occur on Earth.\n\nThe most widely accepted theory of the Moon's origin, the [[giant-impact hypothesis]], states that it formed from the collision of a Mars-size protoplanet called Theia with the early Earth. This hypothesis explains (among other things) the Moon's relative lack of iron and volatile elements and the fact that its composition is nearly identical to that of Earth's crust.<ref name=\"canup_asphaug2001b\"/>\n\n== Asteroids and artificial satellites ==\n[[File:Tracy Caldwell Dyson in Cupola ISS.jpg|thumb|[[Tracy Caldwell Dyson]] viewing Earth from the [[ISS]] Cupola, 2010]]\nEarth has at least five [[Quasi-satellite|co-orbital asteroids]], including [[3753 Cruithne]] and {{mpl|2002 AA|29}}.<ref name=whitehouse20021021 /><ref name=christou_asher2011 /> A [[Earth trojan|trojan asteroid]] companion, {{mpl|2010 TK|7}}, is librating around the leading [[Lagrangian point|Lagrange triangular point]], L4, in [[Earth's orbit]] around the Sun.<ref name=Connors /><ref name=Choi />\n\nThe tiny [[near-Earth asteroid]] {{mpl|2006 RH|120}} makes close approaches to the Earth\u2013Moon system roughly every twenty years.

According to [[radiometric dating]] and other evidence, Earth formed [[Age of the Earth|over 4.5 billion years ago]]. [[Gravity of Earth|Earth's gravity]] interacts with other objects in space, especially the Sun and the [[Moon]], which is Earth's only [[natural satellite]]. Earth [[Earth's orbit|orbits around the Sun]] in 365.256 [[solar time|solar days]], a period known as an Earth [[sidereal year]]. During this time, Earth [[Earth's rotation|rotates about its axis]] 366.256 times, that is, a sidereal year has 366.256 sidereal days.<ref group=\"n\" name=\"sidereal_solar\" />\n\n[[#Axial tilt and seasons|Earth's axis of rotation]] is tilted with respect to its orbital plane, producing [[season]]s on Earth. The [[Gravity|gravitational]] interaction between Earth and the Moon causes [[tide]]s, stabilizes Earth's orientation on its axis, and [[Tidal acceleration|gradually slows its rotation]]. Earth is the densest planet in the [[Solar System]] and the largest and most massive of the four [[terrestrial planet|rocky planet]]s.\n\nEarth's outer layer ([[Lithosphere#Earth's lithosphere|lithosphere]]) is divided into several rigid [[Plate tectonics|tectonic plates]] that migrate across the surface over many millions of years. About 29% of Earth's surface is [[Land#History of land on Earth|land]] consisting of [[continent]]s and [[island]]s.

Three-quarters of the atmosphere's mass is contained within the first {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=on}} of the surface. This lowest layer is called the troposphere. Energy from the Sun heats this layer, and the surface below, causing expansion of the air. This lower-density air then rises and is replaced by cooler, higher-density air. The result is [[atmospheric circulation]] that drives the weather and climate through redistribution of thermal energy.<ref name=\"moran2005\" />\n\nThe primary atmospheric circulation bands consist of the [[trade winds]] in the equatorial region below 30\u00b0 latitude and the [[westerlies]] in the mid-latitudes between 30\u00b0 and 60\u00b0.<ref name=\"berger2002\" /> [[Ocean current]]s are also important factors in determining climate, particularly the [[thermohaline circulation]] that distributes thermal energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions.<ref name=rahmstorf2003 />\n\nWater vapor generated through surface evaporation is transported by circulatory patterns in the atmosphere. When atmospheric conditions permit an uplift of warm, humid air, this water condenses and falls to the surface as precipitation.<ref name=\"moran2005\" /> Most of the water is then transported to lower elevations by river systems and usually returned to the oceans or deposited into lakes. This [[water cycle]] is a vital mechanism for supporting life on land and is a primary factor in the erosion of surface features over geological periods. Precipitation patterns vary widely, ranging from several meters of water per year to less than a millimeter. Atmospheric circulation, topographic features, and temperature differences determine the average precipitation that falls in each region.<ref name=hydrologic_cycle />\n\nThe amount of solar energy reaching Earth's surface decreases with increasing latitude. At higher latitudes, the sunlight reaches the surface at lower angles, and it must pass through thicker columns of the atmosphere. As a result, the mean annual air temperature at sea level decreases by about {{convert|0.4|C-change|F-change|1}} per degree of latitude from the equator.<ref name=sadava_heller2006 /> Earth's surface can be subdivided into specific latitudinal belts of approximately homogeneous climate. Ranging from the equator to the polar regions, these are the [[Tropics|tropical]] (or equatorial), [[Subtropics|subtropical]], [[temperate]] and [[Polar region|polar]] climates.<ref name=climate_zones />\n\nThis latitudinal rule has several anomalies:\n* Proximity to oceans moderates the climate. For example, the [[Scandinavian Peninsula]] has more moderate climate than similarly northern latitudes of [[northern Canada]].\n* The [[wind]] enables this moderating effect. The windward side of a land mass experiences more moderation than the leeward side. In the Northern Hemisphere, the prevailing wind is west-to-east, and western coasts tend to be milder than eastern coasts. This is seen in Eastern North America and Western Europe, where rough continental climates appear on the east coast on parallels with mild climates on the other side of the ocean.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.livescience.com/13573-east-coast-colder-europe-west-coast.html |title=Why U.S. East Coast is colder than Europe's West Coast |publisher=Live Science |date=5 April 2011 |accessdate=7 July 2015}}</ref> In the Southern Hemisphere, the prevailing wind is east-to-west, and the eastern coasts are milder.\n* The distance from Earth to the Sun varies. Earth is closest to the Sun (at [[perihelion]]) in January, which is summer in the Southern Hemisphere. It is furthest away (at [[aphelion]]) in July, which is summer in the Northern Hemisphere, and only 93.55% of the solar radiation from the Sun falls on a given square area of land than at perihelion.

This causes a slow but steady [[Atmospheric escape|loss of the atmosphere into space]]. Because unfixed [[hydrogen]] has a low [[molecular mass]], it can achieve [[escape velocity]] more readily, and it leaks into outer space at a greater rate than other gases.<ref name=jas31_4_1118 /> The leakage of hydrogen into space contributes to the shifting of Earth's atmosphere and surface from an initially [[redox|reducing]] state to its current [[Redox|oxidizing]] one. Photosynthesis provided a source of free oxygen, but the loss of reducing agents such as hydrogen is thought to have been a necessary precondition for the widespread accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere.<ref name=sci293_5531_839 /> Hence the ability of hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere may have influenced the nature of life that developed on Earth.<ref name=abedon1997 /> In the current, oxygen-rich atmosphere most hydrogen is converted into water before it has an opportunity to escape.

The orbital and axial planes are not precisely aligned: Earth's [[axial tilt|axis is tilted]] some 23.44&nbsp;degrees from the perpendicular to the Earth\u2013Sun plane (the [[ecliptic]]), and the Earth\u2013Moon plane is tilted up to \u00b15.1&nbsp;degrees against the Earth\u2013Sun plane. Without this tilt, there would be an eclipse every two weeks, alternating between [[lunar eclipse]]s and [[solar eclipse]]s.<ref name=\"earth_fact_sheet\" /><ref name=\"moon_fact_sheet\" />\n\nThe [[Hill sphere]], or the sphere of [[Gravity|gravitational]] influence, of Earth is about {{convert|1.5|e6km|mi|abbr=unit}} in radius.<ref name=vazquez_etal2006 /><ref group=\"n\" name=\"hill_radius\" /> This is the maximum distance at which Earth's gravitational influence is stronger than the more distant Sun and planets. Objects must orbit Earth within this radius, or they can become unbound by the gravitational perturbation of the Sun.\n\nEarth, along with the Solar System, is situated in the [[Milky Way]] and orbits about 28,000&nbsp;[[light-year]]s from its center. It is about 20&nbsp;light-years above the [[galactic plane]] in the [[Orion Arm]].<ref name=nasa20051201 />\n\n=== Axial tilt and seasons ===\n{{Main|Axial tilt#Earth}}\n[[File:AxialTiltObliquity.png|thumb|right|Earth's axial tilt (or [[obliquity]]) and its relation to the [[rotation]] axis and [[Orbital plane (astronomy)|plane of orbit]]]]\nThe axial tilt of Earth is approximately 23.439281\u00b0<ref name=\"IERS\" /> with the axis of its orbit plane, always pointing towards the [[Celestial Poles]]. Due to Earth's axial tilt, the amount of sunlight reaching any given point on the surface varies over the course of the year. This causes the seasonal change in climate, with [[summer]] in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] occurring when the [[Tropic of Cancer]] is facing the Sun, and [[winter]] taking place when the [[Tropic of Capricorn]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] faces the Sun. During the summer, the day lasts longer, and the Sun climbs higher in the sky. In winter, the climate becomes cooler and the days shorter. In northern temperate latitudes, the Sun rises north of true east during the summer solstice, and sets north of true west, reversing in the winter. The Sun rises south of true east in the summer for the southern temperate zone and sets south of true west.\n\nAbove the [[Arctic Circle]], an extreme case is reached where there is no daylight at all for part of the year, up to six months at the North Pole itself, a [[polar night]]. In the Southern Hemisphere, the situation is exactly reversed, with the [[South Pole]] oriented opposite the direction of the North Pole. Six months later, this pole will experience a [[midnight sun]], a day of 24 hours, again reversing with the South Pole.\n\nBy astronomical convention, the four seasons can be determined by the [[solstice]]s\u2014the points in the orbit of maximum axial tilt toward or away from the Sun\u2014and the [[equinox]]es, when Earth's rotational axis is aligned with its orbital axis. In the Northern Hemisphere, [[winter solstice]] currently occurs around 21 December; [[summer solstice]] is near 21 June, [[March equinox|spring equinox]] is around 20 March and [[September equinox|autumnal equinox]] is about 22 or 23 September. In the Southern Hemisphere, the situation is reversed, with the summer and winter solstices exchanged and the spring and autumnal equinox dates swapped.<ref name=bromberg2008 />\n\nThe angle of Earth's axial tilt is relatively stable over long periods of time. Its axial tilt does undergo [[nutation]]; a slight, irregular motion with a main period of 18.6&nbsp;years.<ref name=lin2006 /> The orientation (rather than the angle) of Earth's axis also changes over time, [[precession|precessing]] around in a complete circle over each 25,800&nbsp;year cycle; this precession is the reason for the difference between a sidereal year and a [[tropical year]]. Both of these motions are caused by the varying attraction of the Sun and the Moon on Earth's equatorial bulge. The poles also migrate a few meters across Earth's surface. This [[polar motion]] has multiple, cyclical components, which collectively are termed [[quasiperiodic motion]]. In addition to an annual component to this motion, there is a 14-month cycle called the [[Chandler wobble]]. Earth's rotational velocity also varies in a phenomenon known as length-of-day variation.<ref name=fisher19960205 />\n\nIn modern times, Earth's [[perihelion]] occurs around 3 January, and its [[aphelion]] around 4 July. These dates change over time due to precession and other orbital factors, which follow cyclical patterns known as [[Milankovitch cycles]]. The changing Earth\u2013Sun distance causes an increase of about 6.9%<ref group=\"n\" name=\"solar_energy\" /> in solar energy reaching Earth at perihelion relative to aphelion. Because the Southern Hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun at about the same time that Earth reaches the closest approach to the Sun, the Southern Hemisphere receives slightly more energy from the Sun than does the northern over the course of a year. This effect is much less significant than the total energy change due to the axial tilt, and most of the excess energy is absorbed by the higher proportion of water in the Southern Hemisphere.<ref name=williams20051230 />\n\nA study from 2016 suggested that [[Planet Nine]] tilted all the planets of the [[Solar System]], including Earth, by about six degrees.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.space.com/34448-planet-nine-solar-system-tilt.html |title=Did the Mysterious 'Planet Nine' Tilt the Solar System? |work=Space.com |first=Charles Q. |last=Choi |date=19 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Habitability ==\n[[File:Moraine Lake 17092005.jpg|thumb|The [[Rocky Mountains]] in Canada overlook [[Moraine Lake]].]]\nA planet that can sustain life is termed [[Planetary habitability|habitable]], even if life did not originate there.

It is the largest moon in the Solar System relative to the size of its planet, although [[Charon (moon)|Charon]] is larger relative to the [[dwarf planet]] [[Pluto]]. The natural satellites of other planets are also referred to as \"moons\", after Earth's.\n\nThe gravitational attraction between Earth and the Moon causes [[tide]]s on Earth. The same effect on the Moon has led to its [[tidal locking]]: its rotation period is the same as the time it takes to orbit Earth. As a result, it always presents the same face to the planet. As the Moon orbits Earth, different parts of its face are illuminated by the Sun, leading to the [[lunar phase]]s; the dark part of the face is separated from the light part by the [[terminator (solar)|solar terminator]].\n[[File:Earth-Moon.svg|thumb|left|Details of the Earth\u2013Moon system, showing the radius of each object and the Earth\u2013Moon [[barycenter]].

Over millions of years, these tiny modifications\u2014and the lengthening of Earth's day by about 23&nbsp;[[Microsecond|\u00b5s]]/yr\u2014add up to significant changes.<ref name=espenak_meeus20070207 /> During the [[Devonian]] period, for example, (approximately {{val|410|u=Mya}}) there were 400 days in a year, with each day lasting 21.8 hours.<ref>{{cite book |last=Lambeck |first=Kurt |title=The Earth's Variable Rotation: Geophysical Causes and Consequences |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1980 |page=367 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-kiG3uYkoUEC&pg=PA62 |isbn=978-0-521-67330-3}}</ref>\n\nThe Moon may have dramatically affected the development of life by moderating the planet's climate. [[Paleontology|Paleontological]] evidence and computer simulations show that Earth's axial tilt is stabilized by tidal interactions with the Moon.<ref name=aaa428_261 /> Some theorists think that without this stabilization against the [[torque]]s applied by the Sun and planets to Earth's equatorial bulge, the rotational axis might be chaotically unstable, exhibiting chaotic changes over millions of years, as appears to be the case for Mars.<ref name=nature410_6830_773 />\n\nViewed from Earth, the Moon is just far enough away to have almost the same apparent-sized disk as the Sun. The [[angular size]] (or [[solid angle]]) of these two bodies match because, although the Sun's diameter is about 400 times as large as the Moon's, it is also 400 times more distant.<ref name=angular /> This allows total and annular solar eclipses to occur on Earth.\n\nThe most widely accepted theory of the Moon's origin, the [[giant-impact hypothesis]], states that it formed from the collision of a Mars-size protoplanet called Theia with the early Earth. This hypothesis explains (among other things) the Moon's relative lack of iron and volatile elements and the fact that its composition is nearly identical to that of Earth's crust.<ref name=\"canup_asphaug2001b\"/>\n\n== Asteroids and artificial satellites ==\n[[File:Tracy Caldwell Dyson in Cupola ISS.jpg|thumb|[[Tracy Caldwell Dyson]] viewing Earth from the [[ISS]] Cupola, 2010]]\nEarth has at least five [[Quasi-satellite|co-orbital asteroids]], including [[3753 Cruithne]] and {{mpl|2002 AA|29}}.<ref name=whitehouse20021021 /><ref name=christou_asher2011 /> A [[Earth trojan|trojan asteroid]] companion, {{mpl|2010 TK|7}}, is librating around the leading [[Lagrangian point|Lagrange triangular point]], L4, in [[Earth's orbit]] around the Sun.<ref name=Connors /><ref name=Choi />\n\nThe tiny [[near-Earth asteroid]] {{mpl|2006 RH|120}} makes close approaches to the Earth\u2013Moon system roughly every twenty years.

Gift cards are also given out by employers or organizations as rewards or gifts. They may also be distributed by retailers and marketers as part of a promotion strategy, to entice the recipient to come in or return to the store, and at times such cards are called '''cash cards'''. Gift cards are generally redeemable only for purchases at the relevant retail premises and cannot be cashed out, and in some situations may be subject to an expiry date or fees. [[American Express]], [[MasterCard]], and [[Visa Inc.|Visa]] offer generic gift cards which need not be redeemed at particular stores, and which are widely used for '''cashback''' marketing strategies. A feature of these cards is that they are generally anonymous and are disposed of when the stored value on a card is exhausted.\n\nFrom the purchaser's point of view, a gift card is a [[gift]], given in place of an object which the recipient may not need, when the giving of cash as a present may be regarded as socially inappropriate. In the [[United States]], gift cards are highly popular, ranking in 2006 as the second-most given gift by consumers, the most-wanted gift by women, and the third-most wanted by males.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} Gift cards have become increasingly popular as they relieve the donor of selecting a specific gift.<ref name=consumer>{{cite web|website=consumeraffairs.com|url=http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/2006/02/gift_cards_congress.html |title=Congress Considers New Gift Card Rules |author=Hood, James R. |date=20 February 2006 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308094912/http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/2006/02/gift_cards_congress.html |archivedate=8 March 2012 |accessdate=16 June 2008}}</ref> In 2012, nearly 50% of all US consumers claimed to have purchased a gift card as a present during the holiday season.<ref name=giftcard>{{cite web | url=http://www.giftcardlab.com/reports/2012-holiday-spending-report | title=2012 Holiday Gift Card Spending Report | date=26 November 2012 | website=giftcardlab.com | accessdate=12 January 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203041627/http://www.giftcardlab.com/reports/2012-holiday-spending-report | archive-date=3 December 2013 | url-status=dead }}</ref> In Canada, $1.8 billion was spent on gift cards, and in the UK it is estimated to have reached \u00a33 billion in 2009,{{update inline|date=February 2014}} whereas in the United States about US$80 billion was paid for gift cards in 2006.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.cbc.ca/news/yourview/2007/12/cash_not_gift_cards_the_best_p.html |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080524051343/http://www.cbc.ca/news/yourview/2007/12/cash_not_gift_cards_the_best_p.html |url-status= dead |archive-date= 24 May 2008 |title= Cash, not gift cards, the best present: consumers' association|work= CBS News|date= 24 December 2007}}</ref><ref\nname=lewis>{{cite web | url=http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/2006/12/gift_card_giveaways.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916232357/http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/2006/12/gift_card_giveaways.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=16 September 2008 | author=Lewis, Truman | title=Gift Cards an $8 Billion Gift to Retailers|website=consumeraffairs.com | date=20 December 2006|accessdate= 16 June 2008}}</ref> The recipient of a gift card can use it at their discretion within the restrictions set by the issue, for example as to validity period and businesses that accept a particular card.\n\n==History==\n{{more citations needed|date=June 2012}}\n[[Neiman Marcus]] introduced the first giftcard using a payments infrastructure in late 1994,<ref>{{cite web|last=Buchanan|first=Matt|title=The Vile History of Gift Cards and How They Came to Destroy Christmas|url=https://gizmodo.com/5434783/the-vile-history-of-gift-cards-and-how-they-came-to-destroy-christmas|website=Gizmodo|accessdate=7 June 2012}}</ref> though [[Blockbuster LLC|Blockbuster Entertainment]] was the first company to do so on a wide scale,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/CES%2fNaBANCO+introduces+stored+value+card+technology%3b+Blockbuster...-a017787941|title=CES/NaBANCO introduces stored value card technology; Blockbuster Video is first merchant partner|website=Business Wire|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130619150012/https://www.thefreelibrary.com/CES%2fNaBANCO+introduces+stored+value+card+technology%3b+Blockbuster...-a017787941|archive-date=19 June 2013|url-status=dead|accessdate=14 January 2018}}</ref> test-marketing them in 1995 and launching them around the country the next year. In the beginning, the Blockbuster giftcard replaced gift certificates that were being counterfeited with recently introduced color copiers and color printers. Blockbuster's first giftcard transactions were processed by what was then Nabanco of [[Sunrise, Florida]] Nabanco was the developer of the first third-party platform for the processing of gift cards using existing payment infrastructure.\n\nNeiman Marcus and Blockbuster were later followed by the [[Mobil]] gas card, which initially offered prepaid phone value provided by [[MCI Inc.|MCI]]. [[Kmart]] was next with the introduction of the Kmart Cash Card, which in the early generations provided prepaid phone time with [[AT&T]]. Later Kmart and Mobil dropped this feature, as it was not profitable for them. The Kmart Mags Pangilinan Cash Card was the first replacement for cash returns when a shopper did not have a receipt for a gift. This practice of giving a cash card in place of cash for non-receipted returns is commonplace today with most merchants. From these early introductions, other retailers began to adapt a giftcard program to replace their gift certificate programs.\n\n==Function and types==\n[[File:Gift card assortment.jpg|300px|thumb|right|An assortment of gift cards, many from U.S. national retailers such as [[Best Buy]], [[Target Corporation|Target]], and [[Home Depot]].]]\nA gift card may resemble a [[credit card]] or display a specific theme on a plastic card the size of a credit card. The card is identified by a specific number or code, not usually with an individual name, and thus could be used by anybody. They are backed by an on-line electronic system for authorization. Some gift cards can be reloaded by payment and can be used thus multiple times.\n\nCards may have a serial number, [[barcode]], [[magnetic strip]], which is read by an electronic credit card machine. Many cards have no value until they are sold, at which time the cashier enters the amount which the customer wishes to put on the card. This amount is rarely stored on the card but is instead noted in the merchant's [[database]], which is cross linked to the card ID. Gift cards thus are generally not [[stored-value card]]s as used in many public transport systems or library photocopiers, where a simplified system with no network stores the value only on the card itself. To thwart [[counterfeiting]], the data is [[encrypted]]. The magnetic strip is also often placed differently than on credit cards, so they cannot be read or written with standard equipment. Other gift cards may have a set value and need to be activated by calling a specific phone number.\n\nGift cards can also be individually custom tailored to meet specific needs. By adding a custom message or name on the front of the card, it can make for an individualized gift or incentive to an employee to show how greatly they are appreciated.\n\nGift cards are divided into open loop or network cards and closed loop cards. The former are issued by banks or credit card companies and can be redeemed by different merchants, the latter by a specific store or restaurant and can be only redeemed by the issuing provider. The latter, however, tend to have fewer problems with card value decay and fees.<ref name=\"consumerreports\">{{cite web|url=http://consumerreports.org/holiday-shopping/tips-for-giving-gift-cards/|title=Avoid gift card pitfalls|date=December 2007|website=Consumer Reports|accessdate=16 June 2008}}</ref> Card value decay is less of an issue since the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure (CARD) Act was passed by the US Congress in 2009. Inactivity fees and card expirations are both limited by the new law.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ncsl.org/research/financial-services-and-commerce/gift-cards-and-certificates-statutes-and-legis.aspx|title=Gift Cards and Gift Certificates Statutes and Legislation|date=April 22, 2016|website=|accessdate=14 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn either case the giver would buy the gift card and may have to pay an additional purchase or activation fee, and the recipient of the card would use the value of the card at a later transaction. A third form is the hybrid closed loop card whose issuer has bundled a number of closed loop cards; an example is free gift cards for a specific [[shopping mall]].\n\nGift cards differ from [[scrip]] gift certificates, in that the latter are usually sold as a paper document with an authorized signature by a restaurant, store, or other individual establishment as a [[voucher]] for a future service; there is no electronic authorization. A gift certificate may or may not have an expiration date and generally has no administrative fees.\n\nBank issued gift cards may be used in lieu of checks as a way to disburse [[rebate (marketing)|rebate]] funds. Some retailers use the gift card system for refunds in lieu of cash thereby assuring that the customer will spend the funds at their store.\n\nA [[charity gift card]] allows the gift giver to make a charitable donation and the gift recipient to choose a charity that will receive the donation.\n\nGift cards can also be country-specific, and can be used to access USA-specific programming and media when outside the United States.\n\n===Mobile and virtual gift cards===\n[[File:App Store Gift Card by Zihexin.jpg|thumb|An [[app store]] gift card display in a shop]]\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2019}}\nMobile gift cards are delivered to mobile phones via [[email]] or [[SMS]], and phone apps allow users to carry only their cell phone. Benefits include tying them to a particular phone number and ease of distribution.\n\nVirtual gift cards are delivered via email to the recipient, the benefits being that they cannot be lost and that the consumer does not have to drive to the brick and mortar location to purchase a gift card.\n\nOther companies have introduced virtual gift cards that users redeem on their smartphones. As the merchant is not involved in the loop, it is considered a cash transfer rather than a traditional gift card.\n\n==Pitfalls==\nIt has been argued that holiday giving destroys value due to mismatching gifts.<ref name=NYT>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/07/magazine/07wwln_freak.t.html?ex=1325826000&en=970d53de24147ae4&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss | authors=Dubner, Stephen J. Duner & Levitt, Steven D. | title=The Gift-Card Economy | date=7 January 2007 | work=The New York Times}}</ref> The most efficient way to keep value in gifting would be to give cash; however, this is socially acceptable only within limits. Gift cards, to a degree, may overcome this problem but have certain pitfalls. Some feel that the absence of the thought of selecting a specific gift makes a gift card a worse choice than a poorly executed but individual gift.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/2006/12/bad_gift.html | title=Bad Gift Better Than Gift Card, Says Philosopher | date=18 December 2006|website=consumeraffairs.com}}</ref> New products in the gift card industry are evolving to tackle this \"impersonal\" pitfall of gift cards; new services launched by some service providers allows for customization and personalization of gift cards.<ref>{{cite news|url=Our apologies.We're unable to find the page you're looking for. 404. Page Not Found|title=Gift Cards with a Personal Touch|last=|first=|date=4 November 2007|work=Business Week|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nGift cards have been criticized for the issuers ability to set rules that are detrimental to the purchaser or card recipient. For example, gift cards may be subject to an expiry date, administrative fees, restrictions on use, and absence of adequate protection in case of fraud or loss.<ref name=consumer/> Over time fees may render the value of a gift card zero. However, these issues have been addressed in recent years in some jurisdictions. In the [[United States]], many jurisdictions limit or prohibit all fees or expiration dates for gift cards. Furthermore, because of the negative impact on sales that such policies can have, most merchants have adopted and even advertise a no fee, no expiration policy for their gift cards, whether or not state laws require it. In 2011, an estimated 2.5% of gift cards were subject to an expiration date and 2.7% to post sale fees.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scripsmart.com/gift_card_report_2011 |website=ScripSmart |date=2011 |title=Gift Card Report}}</ref>\n\nA quarter of gift card recipients still have not spent gift cards a year after receiving them, according to a [[Consumer Reports]] survey, and a majority of people say they end up spending more than the value of the card once they get to the store.<ref name=npr>{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=97016449 | author=Keith, Tamara | title=Gift Card Warning: Check Retailer's Health | date=17 November 2008 | work=[[NPR]]}}</ref>\n\nIn the event of the bankruptcy of the issuing retailer, the outstanding value on gift cards is considered [[unsecured debt]], and as such gift cards may become valueless.<ref name=npr/> If the company intends to continue trading, gift cards may be honoured even in bankruptcy.\n\nAnother issue regarding gift cards is the growing concerns from retailers and other businesses about what can be done to prevent gift cards from being exploited by fraudsters. Gift card information can either be stolen from their rightful owners by fraudsters or they can be purchased with stolen credit card information. In recent years, cyber criminals have increased their efforts to take advantage of fraudulent gift cards as they are simple to exploit with automated brute-force bot attacks.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.csoonline.com/article/3196035/fraud/what-not-to-get-mom-for-mother-s-day.html | website=CSO Online | title=What Not To Get Mom For Mother's Day | date=11 May 2017}}</ref> The most common form of gift card fraud is committed through the act of stealing card information for activated cards with an existing balance by attacking a retailer's systems which store gift card data. Once a gift card has been compromised, the fraudster will then check the balance through online customer portals before using the funds or reselling on the secondary gift card market.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2017/03/17/prevent-fraud-brute-force-online-coupon-gift-card-attacks/| website=Digital Commerce 360 from Internet Retailer | title=How to prevent fraud from brute force online coupon and gift card attacks | date=17 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Redemption rate==\n{{main | Breakage }}\nNot all gift cards are redeemed. The card may be lost, there may be time decay expiration and fees or complex rules of redemption, or the recipient may not be interested in the store that accepts the card or be under the false assumption that not using it will save money for the giver. It has been estimated that perhaps 10% of cards are not redeemed, amounting to a gain for retailers of about $8 billion in the United States in 2006.<ref name=lewis/>\n\nIn 2012, over $100 billion in gift cards will be purchased in the United States, where over 20% of those gift cards will go unredeemed or unused. This has amassed a large opportunity in the secondary market, similar to the secondary ticket market in the early 2000s. Some companies have created a business in the secondary gift card market that allow consumers to sell their unused gift cards or buy discounted gift cards to their favorite brands. This has helped their users recoup their share of some $55 million per day that goes unredeemed in the United States every year, by turning their unused gift cards into cash.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n==Regulations==\n=== Canada ===\nAll Canadian provinces have legislations passed to ban expiry dates and fees collected on gift cards.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://financialpost.com/entrepreneur/gift-cards-come-with-regulations|title=Most provinces now disallow expiry dates|last=Entrepreneur|date=27 February 2012|website=Financial Post}}</ref> However, provincial gift card legislations do not apply to sectors that are regulated under federal laws.

Gift cards are also given out by employers or organizations as rewards or gifts. They may also be distributed by retailers and marketers as part of a promotion strategy, to entice the recipient to come in or return to the store, and at times such cards are called '''cash cards'''. Gift cards are generally redeemable only for purchases at the relevant retail premises and cannot be cashed out, and in some situations may be subject to an expiry date or fees. [[American Express]], [[MasterCard]], and [[Visa Inc.|Visa]] offer generic gift cards which need not be redeemed at particular stores, and which are widely used for '''cashback''' marketing strategies. A feature of these cards is that they are generally anonymous and are disposed of when the stored value on a card is exhausted.\n\nFrom the purchaser's point of view, a gift card is a [[gift]], given in place of an object which the recipient may not need, when the giving of cash as a present may be regarded as socially inappropriate. In the [[United States]], gift cards are highly popular, ranking in 2006 as the second-most given gift by consumers, the most-wanted gift by women, and the third-most wanted by males.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} Gift cards have become increasingly popular as they relieve the donor of selecting a specific gift.<ref name=consumer>{{cite web|website=consumeraffairs.com|url=http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/2006/02/gift_cards_congress.html |title=Congress Considers New Gift Card Rules |author=Hood, James R. |date=20 February 2006 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308094912/http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/2006/02/gift_cards_congress.html |archivedate=8 March 2012 |accessdate=16 June 2008}} </ref> In 2012, nearly 50% of all US consumers claimed to have purchased a gift card as a present during the holiday season.<ref name=giftcard>{{cite web | url=http://www.giftcardlab.com/reports/2012-holiday-spending-report | title=2012 Holiday Gift Card Spending Report | date=26 November 2012 | website=giftcardlab.com | accessdate=12 January 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203041627/http://www.giftcardlab.com/reports/2012-holiday-spending-report | archive-date=3 December 2013 | url-status=dead }}</ref> In Canada, $1.8 billion was spent on gift cards, and in the UK it is estimated to have reached \u00a33 billion in 2009,{{update inline|date=February 2014}} whereas in the United States about US$80 billion was paid for gift cards in 2006.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.cbc.ca/news/yourview/2007/12/cash_not_gift_cards_the_best_p.html |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080524051343/http://www.cbc.ca/news/yourview/2007/12/cash_not_gift_cards_the_best_p.html |url-status= dead |archive-date= 24 May 2008 |title= Cash, not gift cards, the best present: consumers' association|work= CBS News|date= 24 December 2007}}</ref><ref\nname=lewis>{{cite web | url=http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/2006/12/gift_card_giveaways.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916232357/http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/2006/12/gift_card_giveaways.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=16 September 2008 | author=Lewis, Truman | title=Gift Cards an $8 Billion Gift to Retailers|website=consumeraffairs.com | date=20 December 2006|accessdate= 16 June 2008}}</ref> The recipient of a gift card can use it at their discretion within the restrictions set by the issue, for example as to validity period and businesses that accept a particular card.\n\n==History==\n{{more citations needed|date=June 2012}}\n[[Neiman Marcus]] introduced the first giftcard using a payments infrastructure in late 1994,<ref>{{cite web|last=Buchanan|first=Matt|title=The Vile History of Gift Cards and How They Came to Destroy Christmas|url=https://gizmodo.com/5434783/the-vile-history-of-gift-cards-and-how-they-came-to-destroy-christmas|website=Gizmodo|accessdate=7 June 2012}}</ref> though [[Blockbuster LLC|Blockbuster Entertainment]] was the first company to do so on a wide scale,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/CES%2fNaBANCO+introduces+stored+value+card+technology%3b+Blockbuster...-a017787941|title=CES/NaBANCO introduces stored value card technology; Blockbuster Video is first merchant partner|website=Business Wire|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130619150012/https://www.thefreelibrary.com/CES%2fNaBANCO+introduces+stored+value+card+technology%3b+Blockbuster...-a017787941|archive-date=19 June 2013|url-status=dead|accessdate=14 January 2018}}</ref> test-marketing them in 1995 and launching them around the country the next year. In the beginning, the Blockbuster giftcard replaced gift certificates that were being counterfeited with recently introduced color copiers and color printers. Blockbuster's first giftcard transactions were processed by what was then Nabanco of [[Sunrise, Florida]] Nabanco was the developer of the first third-party platform for the processing of gift cards using existing payment infrastructure.\n\nNeiman Marcus and Blockbuster were later followed by the [[Mobil]] gas card, which initially offered prepaid phone value provided by [[MCI Inc.|MCI]]. [[Kmart]] was next with the introduction of the Kmart Cash Card, which in the early generations provided prepaid phone time with [[AT&T]]. Later Kmart and Mobil dropped this feature, as it was not profitable for them. The Kmart Mags Pangilinan Cash Card was the first replacement for cash returns when a shopper did not have a receipt for a gift. This practice of giving a cash card in place of cash for non-receipted returns is commonplace today with most merchants. From these early introductions, other retailers began to adapt a giftcard program to replace their gift certificate programs.\n\n==Function and types==\n[[File:Gift card assortment.jpg|300px|thumb|right|An assortment of gift cards, many from U.S. national retailers such as [[Best Buy]], [[Target Corporation|Target]], and [[Home Depot]].]]\nA gift card may resemble a [[credit card]] or display a specific theme on a plastic card the size of a credit card. The card is identified by a specific number or code, not usually with an individual name, and thus could be used by anybody. They are backed by an on-line electronic system for authorization. Some gift cards can be reloaded by payment and can be used thus multiple times.\n\nCards may have a serial number, [[barcode]], [[magnetic strip]], which is read by an electronic credit card machine. Many cards have no value until they are sold, at which time the cashier enters the amount which the customer wishes to put on the card. This amount is rarely stored on the card but is instead noted in the merchant's [[database]], which is cross linked to the card ID. Gift cards thus are generally not [[stored-value card]]s as used in many public transport systems or library photocopiers, where a simplified system with no network stores the value only on the card itself. To thwart [[counterfeiting]], the data is [[encrypted]]. The magnetic strip is also often placed differently than on credit cards, so they cannot be read or written with standard equipment. Other gift cards may have a set value and need to be activated by calling a specific phone number.\n\nGift cards can also be individually custom tailored to meet specific needs. By adding a custom message or name on the front of the card, it can make for an individualized gift or incentive to an employee to show how greatly they are appreciated.\n\nGift cards are divided into open loop or network cards and closed loop cards. The former are issued by banks or credit card companies and can be redeemed by different merchants, the latter by a specific store or restaurant and can be only redeemed by the issuing provider. The latter, however, tend to have fewer problems with card value decay and fees.<ref name=\"consumerreports\">{{cite web|url=http://consumerreports.org/holiday-shopping/tips-for-giving-gift-cards/|title=Avoid gift card pitfalls|date=December 2007|website=Consumer Reports|accessdate=16 June 2008}} </ref> Card value decay is less of an issue since the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure (CARD) Act was passed by the US Congress in 2009. Inactivity fees and card expirations are both limited by the new law. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ncsl.org/research/financial-services-and-commerce/gift-cards-and-certificates-statutes-and-legis.aspx|title=Gift Cards and Gift Certificates Statutes and Legislation|date=April 22, 2016|website=|accessdate=14 January 2020}} </ref>\n\nIn either case the giver would buy the gift card and may have to pay an additional purchase or activation fee, and the recipient of the card would use the value of the card at a later transaction. A third form is the hybrid closed loop card whose issuer has bundled a number of closed loop cards; an example is free gift cards for a specific [[shopping mall]].\n\nGift cards differ from [[scrip]] gift certificates, in that the latter are usually sold as a paper document with an authorized signature by a restaurant, store, or other individual establishment as a [[voucher]] for a future service; there is no electronic authorization. A gift certificate may or may not have an expiration date and generally has no administrative fees.\n\nBank issued gift cards may be used in lieu of checks as a way to disburse [[rebate (marketing)|rebate]] funds. Some retailers use the gift card system for refunds in lieu of cash thereby assuring that the customer will spend the funds at their store.\n\nA [[charity gift card]] allows the gift giver to make a charitable donation and the gift recipient to choose a charity that will receive the donation.\n\nGift cards can also be country-specific, and can be used to access USA-specific programming and media when outside the United States. \n\n===Mobile and virtual gift cards===\n[[File:App Store Gift Card by Zihexin.jpg|thumb|An [[app store]] gift card display in a shop]]\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2019}}\nMobile gift cards are delivered to mobile phones via [[email]] or [[SMS]], and phone apps allow users to carry only their cell phone. Benefits include tying them to a particular phone number and ease of distribution.\n\nVirtual gift cards are delivered via email to the recipient, the benefits being that they cannot be lost and that the consumer does not have to drive to the brick and mortar location to purchase a gift card.\n\nOther companies have introduced virtual gift cards that users redeem on their smartphones. As the merchant is not involved in the loop, it is considered a cash transfer rather than a traditional gift card.\n\n==Pitfalls==\nIt has been argued that holiday giving destroys value due to mismatching gifts.<ref name=NYT>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/07/magazine/07wwln_freak.t.html?ex=1325826000&en=970d53de24147ae4&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss | authors=Dubner, Stephen J. Duner & Levitt, Steven D. | title=The Gift-Card Economy | date=7 January 2007 | work=The New York Times}}</ref> The most efficient way to keep value in gifting would be to give cash; however, this is socially acceptable only within limits. Gift cards, to a degree, may overcome this problem but have certain pitfalls. Some feel that the absence of the thought of selecting a specific gift makes a gift card a worse choice than a poorly executed but individual gift.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/2006/12/bad_gift.html | title=Bad Gift Better Than Gift Card, Says Philosopher | date=18 December 2006|website=consumeraffairs.com}}</ref> New products in the gift card industry are evolving to tackle this \"impersonal\" pitfall of gift cards; new services launched by some service providers allows for customization and personalization of gift cards.<ref>{{cite news|url=Our apologies.We're unable to find the page you're looking for. 404.

For example, gift cards may be subject to an expiry date, administrative fees, restrictions on use, and absence of adequate protection in case of fraud or loss.<ref name=consumer/> Over time fees may render the value of a gift card zero. However, these issues have been addressed in recent years in some jurisdictions. In the [[United States]], many jurisdictions limit or prohibit all fees or expiration dates for gift cards. Furthermore, because of the negative impact on sales that such policies can have, most merchants have adopted and even advertise a no fee, no expiration policy for their gift cards, whether or not state laws require it. In 2011, an estimated 2.5% of gift cards were subject to an expiration date and 2.7% to post sale fees.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scripsmart.com/gift_card_report_2011 |website=ScripSmart |date=2011 |title=Gift Card Report}}</ref>\n\nA quarter of gift card recipients still have not spent gift cards a year after receiving them, according to a [[Consumer Reports]] survey, and a majority of people say they end up spending more than the value of the card once they get to the store.<ref name=npr>{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=97016449 | author=Keith, Tamara | title=Gift Card Warning: Check Retailer's Health | date=17 November 2008 | work=[[NPR]]}}</ref> \n\nIn the event of the bankruptcy of the issuing retailer, the outstanding value on gift cards is considered [[unsecured debt]], and as such gift cards may become valueless.<ref name=npr>{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=97016449 | author=Keith, Tamara | title=Gift Card Warning: Check Retailer's Health | date=17 November 2008 | work=[[NPR]]}}</ref> If the company intends to continue trading, gift cards may be honoured even in bankruptcy.\n\nAnother issue regarding gift cards is the growing concerns from retailers and other businesses about what can be done to prevent gift cards from being exploited by fraudsters. Gift card information can either be stolen from their rightful owners by fraudsters or they can be purchased with stolen credit card information. In recent years, cyber criminals have increased their efforts to take advantage of fraudulent gift cards as they are simple to exploit with automated brute-force bot attacks.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.csoonline.com/article/3196035/fraud/what-not-to-get-mom-for-mother-s-day.html | website=CSO Online | title=What Not To Get Mom For Mother's Day | date=11 May 2017}}</ref> The most common form of gift card fraud is committed through the act of stealing card information for activated cards with an existing balance by attacking a retailer's systems which store gift card data. Once a gift card has been compromised, the fraudster will then check the balance through online customer portals before using the funds or reselling on the secondary gift card market.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2017/03/17/prevent-fraud-brute-force-online-coupon-gift-card-attacks/| website=Digital Commerce 360 from Internet Retailer | title=How to prevent fraud from brute force online coupon and gift card attacks | date=17 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Redemption rate==\n{{main | Breakage }}\nNot all gift cards are redeemed. The card may be lost, there may be time decay expiration and fees or complex rules of redemption, or the recipient may not be interested in the store that accepts the card or be under the false assumption that not using it will save money for the giver. It has been estimated that perhaps 10% of cards are not redeemed, amounting to a gain for retailers of about $8 billion in the United States in 2006.<ref name=lewis/>\n\nIn 2012, over $100 billion in gift cards will be purchased in the United States, where over 20% of those gift cards will go unredeemed or unused. This has amassed a large opportunity in the secondary market, similar to the secondary ticket market in the early 2000s. Some companies have created a business in the secondary gift card market that allow consumers to sell their unused gift cards or buy discounted gift cards to their favorite brands. This has helped their users recoup their share of some $55 million per day that goes unredeemed in the United States every year, by turning their unused gift cards into cash.{{cn|date=May 2019}}\n\n==Regulations==\n=== Canada ===\nAll Canadian provinces have legislations passed to ban expiry dates and fees collected on gift cards.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://financialpost.com/entrepreneur/gift-cards-come-with-regulations|title=Most provinces now disallow expiry dates|last=Entrepreneur|date=27 February 2012|website=Financial Post}}</ref> However, provincial gift card legislations do not apply to sectors that are regulated under federal laws.
