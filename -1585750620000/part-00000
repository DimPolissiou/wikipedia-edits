{"title_page": "Quiet Revolution", "text_new": "{{other uses}}\nThe '''Quiet Revolution''' ({{lang-fr|R\u00e9volution tranquille}}) was a period of intense socio-political and socio-cultural change in the [[Canadian province]] of [[Quebec|Qu\u00e9bec]], characterized by the effective [[secularization]] of government, the creation of a state-run [[welfare state]] (''\u00e9tat-providence''), and realignment of politics into [[Quebec federalism|federalist]] and [[Quebec sovereignty movement|sovereigntist]] (or [[Separatism|separatist]]) factions and the eventual election of a pro-sovereignty provincial government in the [[1976 Quebec general election|1976 election]]. The Quiet Revolution typically refers to the efforts made by the Liberal government of [[Jean Lesage]] (elected in 1960), and sometimes [[Robert Bourassa]] (elected in 1970 after the [[Union Nationale (Quebec)|Union Nationale]]'s [[Daniel Johnson Sr.|Daniel Johnson]] in 1966), though given the profound effect of the changes, most provincial governments since the early 1960s have maintained an orientation based on core concepts developed and implemented in that era.\n\nA primary change was an effort by the provincial government to take more direct control over the fields of health care and education, which had previously been in the hands of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. It created ministries of [[Ministry of Health and Social Services (Quebec)|Health]] and [[Ministry of Education, Recreation and Sports (Quebec)|Education]], expanded the public service, and made massive investments in the public education system and provincial infrastructure. The government further allowed [[trade union|unionization]] of the [[civil service]]. It took measures to increase Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois control over [[economy of Quebec|the province's economy]] and [[Nationalization|nationalized]] electricity production and distribution and worked to establish the [[Canada Pension Plan|Canada/Qu\u00e9bec Pension Plan]]. [[Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec]] was also created in an attempt to nationalize Qu\u00e9bec's electric companies. French-Canadians in Qu\u00e9bec also adopted the new name 'Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois', trying to create a separate identity from France and establish themselves as a reformed province.\n\nThe Quiet Revolution was a period of unbridled economic and social development in [[Quebec|Qu\u00e9bec]] and [[Canada]] and paralleled similar developments in the [[Western world|West]] in general. It was a byproduct of Canada's 20-year post-war expansion and Qu\u00e9bec's position as the leading province for more than a century before and after [[Canadian confederation|Confederation]]. It witnessed particular changes to the built environment and social structures of [[Montreal]], Qu\u00e9bec's leading city. The Quiet Revolution also extended beyond Qu\u00e9bec's borders by virtue of its influence on contemporary Canadian politics. During the same era of renewed Quebecois nationalism,<ref>{{cite book |first1= John |last1= Dickinson |first2= Brian |last2= Young |title= A Short History of Quebec |url= https://archive.org/details/shorthistoryofqu0000dick_z9p8 |url-access= registration |location= Montreal |publisher= McGill-Queen's University Press |year= 2003 |page= [https://archive.org/details/shorthistoryofqu0000dick_z9p8/page/372 372] }}</ref> French Canadians made great inroads into both the structure and direction of the federal government and national policy. Moreover, certain facets of the welfare state, as they developed in Qu\u00e9bec in the 1960s, became nationalized by virtue of Qu\u00e9bec's acceptance and promotion. This would include [[rural electrification]] and healthcare initiatives undertaken by [[Tommy Douglas]] in [[Saskatchewan]] twenty years earlier.\n\n== Origins ==\n[[File:PlaceDArmes by Msteckiw.jpg|thumb|The hill leading to [[Place d'Armes]] in Montreal, an important historic site of French Canada]]\n\nThe Quiet Revolution began with the enacted [[Parti lib\u00e9ral du Qu\u00e9bec|Liberal]] provincial government of [[Jean Lesage]], who was elected in the June [[1960 Quebec general election|1960 provincial election]], shortly after the death of Premier [[Maurice Duplessis]], whose tenure was known by some as the [[Grande Noirceur]] (Great Darkness), but viewed by conservatives as epitomizing a religiously and culturally pure Qu\u00e9bec.\n\nPrior to the 1960s, the government of Qu\u00e9bec was controlled by the conservative Duplessis, leader of the [[Union Nationale (Quebec)|Union Nationale]] party. Not all the Catholic Church supported Duplessis - some Catholic unions and members of the clergy criticized him, including Montreal Archbishop [[Joseph Charbonneau]] - but the bulk of the small-town and rural clergy supported him.<ref name=\"Behiels 1985\">{{cite book |last=Behiels |first=Michael |title=Prelude to Quebec's Quiet Revolution |url=https://archive.org/details/preludetoquebecs0000behi |url-access=registration |date=1985 |publisher=McGill}}</ref> Some quoted the Union Nationale slogan ''Le ciel est bleu, l'enfer est rouge'' (The sky (Heaven) is blue, Hell is red) as a reference to the colours of the Union Nationale (blue) and the Liberals (red), the latter accused often of being pro-communist.{{Citation needed |date=April 2014}} [[Radio-Canada]], the newspaper ''[[Le Devoir]]'' and political journal ''[[Cit\u00e9 Libre]]'' were [[intellectual]] forums for critics of the Duplessis government.<ref name=\"Behiels 1985\" />\n\nPrior to the Quiet Revolution, the province's natural resources were developed mainly by foreign investors.{{Citation needed |date=April 2014}} As an example, the process of mining iron ore was developed by the US-based [[Iron Ore Company of Canada]]. In the spring of 1949, a group of 5,000 asbestos miners went on strike for three months. The 1949 [[Asbestos Strike]] found Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois miners united against a nationalist foreign corporation. Those who supported the miners included Monsignor Charbonneau, Bishop of Montreal, the Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois nationalist newspaper, ''Le Devoir'', and a small group of [[intellectual]] individuals.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/canadaquebecuses0000cook_d3k0 |url-access=registration |location=Toronto |publisher=McLelland & Stewart Inc. |title=Canada, Quebec, and the Uses of Nationalism |isbn=9780771022616 |year=1986 }}</ref> Until the second half of the 20th century, the majority of Francophone Qu\u00e9bec workers lived below the poverty line,{{Citation needed |date=April 2014}} and Francophones did not join the executive ranks of the businesses of their own province.{{Citation needed |date=October 2010}} Political activist and singer [[F\u00e9lix Leclerc]] described this phenomenon, writing, \"Our people are the waterboys of their own country.\"\n\nIn many ways, Duplessis's death in 1959, quickly followed by the sudden death of his successor [[Paul Sauv\u00e9]], triggered the Quiet Revolution. The [[Parti Lib\u00e9ral du Qu\u00e9bec|Liberal Party]], led by [[Jean Lesage]] and campaigning under the slogans ''Il faut que \u00e7a change'' (\"Things have to change\") and ''Ma\u00eetres chez nous'' (\"Masters of our own house\", a phrase coined by ''[[Le Devoir]]'' editor [[Andr\u00e9 Laurendeau]]), was voted into power within a year of Duplessis's death.\n\nIt is generally accepted that the revolution ended before the [[October Crisis]] of 1970, but Qu\u00e9bec society has continued to change dramatically since then, notably with the rise of the sovereignty movement, evidenced by the election of the sovereignist [[Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] (first in 1976 by [[Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque]]),<ref name=\"Dickinson Young 324\">{{cite book |first1= John |last1= Dickinson |first2= Brian |last2= Young |title= A Short History of Quebec |url= https://archive.org/details/shorthistoryofqu0000dick_z9p8 |url-access= registration |location= Montreal |publisher= McGill-Queen's University Press |year= 2003 |page= [https://archive.org/details/shorthistoryofqu0000dick_z9p8/page/324 324] }}</ref> the formation of a sovereignist political party representing Qu\u00e9bec on the federal level, the [[Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] (founded in 1991 by [[Lucien Bouchard]]),<ref name=\"Dickinson Young 324\" /> as well as the 1980 and 1995 sovereignty referendums.<ref name=\"Dickinson Young 327\">{{cite book |first1= John |last1= Dickinson |first2= Brian |last2= Young |title= A Short History of Quebec |url= https://archive.org/details/shorthistoryofqu0000dick_z9p8 |url-access= registration |location= Montreal |publisher= McGill-Queen's University Press |year= 2003 |page= [https://archive.org/details/shorthistoryofqu0000dick_z9p8/page/327 327] }}</ref><ref name=\"Dickinson Young 354\">{{cite book |first1= John |last1= Dickinson |first2= Brian |last2= Young |title= A Short History of Quebec |url= https://archive.org/details/shorthistoryofqu0000dick_z9p8 |url-access= registration |location= Montreal |publisher= McGill-Queen's University Press |year= 2003 |page= [https://archive.org/details/shorthistoryofqu0000dick_z9p8/page/354 354] }}</ref> Some scholars argue that the rise of the Qu\u00e9bec sovereignty movement during the 1970s is also part of this period.<ref name=\"Dickinson Young 324\" />\n\n==Secularization and education==\nThe [[Constitution Act, 1867|Canadian Constitution of 1867]] made education an area of provincial responsibility. Qu\u00e9bec set up a Ministry of Public Instruction in 1868 but abolished it in 1875 under pressure from the Catholic Church. The clergy believed it would be able to provide appropriate teaching to young people and that the province should not interfere. By the early 1960s, there were more than 1,500 school boards, each responsible for its own programs, textbooks and the recognition of diplomas according to its own criteria.\n\nIn addition, until the Quiet Revolution, higher education was accessible to only a minority of French Canadians because of the generally low level of formal education and the expense involved.<ref name=\"parent\">{{cite web |url= http://www.mccord-museum.qc.ca/scripts/explore.php?Lang=1&elementid=107__true&tableid=11&tablename=theme&contentlong |title= Education in Qu\u00e9bec, before and after the Parent reform |author= Mathieu Pigeon |publisher= McCord Museum |accessdate=October 11, 2010}}</ref> Moreover, secondary schools had placed a lot more emphasis on the [[Liberal arts education|liberal arts]] and [[Soft Science|soft sciences]] than the [[Hard and soft science|hard sciences]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Canada, face of a nation|date=2000|publisher=Gage Educational Pub|others=Bolotta, Angelo, 1951-, Gerrard, Dennis, 1944-, Shortt, Denise.|isbn=0771581521|location=Scarborough, Ont.|oclc=43276936}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Montr\u00e9al UQ\u00c1M.JPG|thumb|[[Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al]]]]\n\nFollowing [[World War&nbsp;II]], while most of the United States and Canada was enjoying a long period of prosperity and modernization, economic growth was slower in Qu\u00e9bec.{{Citation needed| date=February 2013}} The level of formal schooling among French-Canadians was quite low: only 13% finished grade 11, as opposed to 36% of English Canadians. One of the most scathing attacks on the educational system was levelled by Brother [[Jean-Paul Desbiens]], writing under the pseudonym of Fr\u00e8re [[wikt:Untel|Untel]]. The publication of his book ''[[Les insolences du Fr\u00e8re Untel]]'' (1960) quickly sold over 100,000 copies and has come to be recognized as having important impact on the beginning of the Quiet Revolution.{{Citation needed |date=October 2010}}\n\n[[Alphonse-Marie Parent]] presided over a commission established in 1961 to study the education system and bring forth recommendations, which eventually led to the adoption of several reforms, the most important of which was secularization of the education system.

Reforms included: the age for compulsory schooling was raised from 14 to 16, free schooling until the 11th grade, school boards were reorganized, school curricula were standardized, and [[classical college]]s were replaced with [[CEGEP]]s (publicly funded pre\u2011university colleges) in 1965, then the [[Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec]] network in 1969\u2014both as an effort to improve access to higher education, geographically and financially.<ref name=parent/> Additionally, more emphasis was placed on the hard sciences, and there was now work for the Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois who had previously needed to leave the province in order to find jobs in their preferred fields.<ref name=\":0\" /> For example, the opening of Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec meant that skilled engineers needed to be hired.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://collections.musee-mccord.qc.ca/scripts/explore.php?Lang=1&elementid=109__true&tableid=11&tablename=theme&contentlong|title=The Quiet Revolution|last=Pigeon|first=Matthieu|date=2008|website=McCord Museum|access-date=21 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nAlso during this period the Ministry of Social Affairs was created, which in June 1985 became the [[Ministry of Health and Social Services (Quebec)|Ministry of Health and Social Services]], responsible for the administration of health and social services in the province.\n\nThe Quiet Revolution combined declericalization with the dramatic reforms of [[Vatican&nbsp;II]]. There was a dramatic change in the role of nuns, which previously had attracted 2\u20133% of Qu\u00e9bec's young women. Many left the convent while very few young women entered. The Provincial government took over the nuns' traditional role as provider of many of Qu\u00e9b\u00e9c's educational and social services. Often ex-nuns continued the same roles in civilian dress; and for the first time men started entering the teaching profession.<ref>Micheline D'Allaire, \"Les Religieuses du Quebec dans le Courant de la Laicisation\", ''Cultures du Canada Francais'' (1986), Vol. 3, pp 38-45.</ref>\n\nAlso during the time of the Quiet Revolution, Quebec experienced a large drop in the [[total fertility rate]] (known as TFR: the lifetime average number of live births per woman of child-bearing age) falling from 3.8 in 1960 to 1.9 in 1970.<ref>{{cite book |first1= Jean |last1= Bernier |first2= Laurent |last2= Roy |title= Family Policy, Social Trends and Fertility in Qu\u00e9bec: Experimenting with the Nordic Model?| publisher= The Quebec Ministry of Families, Seniors and Status of Women |year= 2007 |page= 11 }}</ref> According to a study commissioned in 2007 by The Qu\u00e9bec Ministry of Families, Seniors and Status of Women on possible ways to address problems related to a by then even lower TFR (1.6) \"Starting in 1960, Qu\u00e9bec experienced a drop in fertility that was so sharp and rapid, it was almost unparalleled in the developed countries.\" <ref>{{cite book |first1= Jean |last1= Bernier |first2= Laurent |last2= Roy |title= Family Policy, Social Trends and Fertility in Qu\u00e9bec: Experimenting with the Nordic Model?| publisher= The Quebec Ministry of Families, Seniors and Status of Women |year= 2007 |page= 5 }}</ref>\n\nIn the 2003 article \"Where Have All the Children Gone?\", published in the academic journal ''Canadian Studies in Population'' by Professor Catherine Krull of Queen's University and Professor Frank Trovato of The University of Alberta, point to the decline in influence of the Roman Catholic Church over the lives of French-Canadians as one of the causes of the great reduction in the TFR during the Quiet Revolution.<ref>{{cite book |first1= Catherine |last1= Krull |first2= Frank |last2= Trovato |title= Where Have All the Children Gone?| publisher= Canadian Studies in Population |year= 2003 |pages= 197\u2013198 }}{{better source|date=September 2018}}</ref> According to a on Quebec History course taught and published study by Professor Claude Belanger of Montreal's Marianopolis College the lose of influence of the RC Church and subsequent abandonment long adhered to Church teaching concerning procreation was a key factor in Quebec going from having the highest provincial birth rate in 1960 to the lowest in 1970.\n\n== Economic reforms ==\n[[File:Manic-2 (2).jpg|right|upright=1.2|thumb|Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec's [[Jean-Lesage generating station]], formerly known as Manic-2, built between 1961 and 1965.|alt=A big concrete structure.]]\n\nSeeking a mandate for its most daring reform, the nationalization of the province's electric companies under [[Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec]], the Liberal Party called for a new [[1962 Quebec general election|election in 1962]].

This was a massive shift away from the Duplessis era in which Qu\u00e9bec's abundant natural resources were hardly utilized. Duplessis' policy was to sell off untransformed natural resources at bargain prices in order to create more employment in Qu\u00e9bec's regions.

In 1963, in conjunction with the [[Canada Pension Plan]] the government of Canada authorized the province to create its own ''R\u00e9gie des Rentes du Qu\u00e9bec'' (RRQ, Qu\u00e9bec Pension Plan); universal contributions came into effect in 1966. The [[Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec]] (CDPQ, Qu\u00e9bec Deposit and Investment Fund) was created in 1965 to manage the considerable revenues generated by the RRQ and to provide the capital necessary for various projects in the public and private sectors.\n\nA new labour code (''Code du Travail'') was adopted in 1964. It made unionizing much easier and gave public employees the right to strike. It was during the same year that the ''[[Civil Code of Quebec|Code Civil]]'' (Civil Code) was modified to recognize the legal equality of spouses.

Though the improvements made to Qu\u00e9bec society during this era make it seem like an extremely innovative period, it has been posited that these changes follow a logical revolutionary movement occurring throughout North America in the 1960s. Noted Qu\u00e9bec historian {{interlanguage link|Jacques Rouillard|fr|vertical-align=sup}} took this [[Historical revisionism|revisionist]] stance in arguing that the Quiet Revolution may have accelerated the natural evolution of Quebec\u2019s francophone society rather than having turned it on its head.<ref name=\"Jacques Rouillard\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hst.umontreal.ca/U/rouillard/revolutionrupture.htm |title=La r\u00e9volution tranquille, rupture ou tournant? |author=Jacques Rouillard |date=Winter 1998 |work=32:4 |publisher=Journal of Canadian Studies/Revue d\u2019\u00e9tudes canadiennes |accessdate=September 22, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514054757/http://www.hst.umontreal.ca/U/rouillard/revolutionrupture.htm |archivedate=May 14, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nSeveral arguments support this view. From an economic perspective, Quebec\u2019s manufacturing sector had seen important growth since the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Buoyed by significant manufacturing demand during [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], the Qu\u00e9bec economy was already expanding before the events of the Quiet Revolution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hst.umontreal.ca/U/rouillard/revolutionrupture.htm |title=La r\u00e9volution tranquille, rupture ou tournant?

He notes the popularity enjoyed by federal Liberal Prime Minister [[Sir Wilfrid Laurier]] as well as the Premiership of [[Ad\u00e9lard Godbout]] as examples of Qu\u00e9bec Liberalism prior to the events of the Quiet Revolution. The Godbout administration was extremely innovative. Its notable achievements include nationalizing the electricity distribution network of the city of Montreal, granting universal suffrage, instituting mandatory schooling until the age of 14 and establishing various social programs in Qu\u00e9bec.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hst.umontreal.ca/U/rouillard/revolutionrupture.htm |title=La r\u00e9volution tranquille, rupture ou tournant?

The Quiet Revolution typically refers to the efforts made by the Liberal government of [[Jean Lesage]] (elected in 1960), and sometimes [[Robert Bourassa]] (elected in 1970 after the [[Union Nationale (Quebec)|Union Nationale]]'s [[Daniel Johnson Sr.|Daniel Johnson]] in 1966), though given the profound effect of the changes, most provincial governments since the early 1960s have maintained an orientation based on core concepts developed and implemented in that era.\n\nA primary change was an effort by the provincial government to take more direct control over the fields of health care and education, which had previously been in the hands of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. It created ministries of [[Ministry of Health and Social Services (Quebec)|Health]] and [[Ministry of Education, Recreation and Sports (Quebec)|Education]], expanded the public service, and made massive investments in the public education system and provincial infrastructure. The government further allowed [[trade union|unionization]] of the [[civil service]]. It took measures to increase Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois control over [[economy of Quebec|the province's economy]] and [[Nationalization|nationalized]] electricity production and distribution and worked to establish the [[Canada Pension Plan|Canada/Qu\u00e9bec Pension Plan]]. [[Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec]] was also created in an attempt to nationalize Qu\u00e9bec's electric companies. French-Canadians in Qu\u00e9bec also adopted the new name 'Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois', trying to create a separate identity from France and establish themselves as a reformed province.\n\nThe Quiet Revolution was a period of unbridled economic and social development in [[Quebec|Qu\u00e9bec]] and [[Canada]] and paralleled similar developments in the [[Western world|West]] in general. It was a byproduct of Canada's 20-year post-war expansion and Qu\u00e9bec's position as the leading province for more than a century before and after [[Canadian confederation|Confederation]]. It witnessed particular changes to the built environment and social structures of [[Montreal]], Qu\u00e9bec's leading city. The Quiet Revolution also extended beyond Qu\u00e9bec's borders by virtue of its influence on contemporary Canadian politics. During the same era of renewed Quebecois nationalism,<ref>{{cite book |first1= John |last1= Dickinson |first2= Brian |last2= Young |title= A Short History of Quebec |url= https://archive.org/details/shorthistoryofqu0000dick_z9p8 |url-access= registration |location= Montreal |publisher= McGill-Queen's University Press |year= 2003 |page= [https://archive.org/details/shorthistoryofqu0000dick_z9p8/page/372 372] }}</ref> French Canadians made great inroads into both the structure and direction of the federal government and national policy. Moreover, certain facets of the welfare state, as they developed in Qu\u00e9bec in the 1960s, became nationalized by virtue of Qu\u00e9bec's acceptance and promotion.

In 1963, in conjunction with the [[Canada Pension Plan]] the government of Canada authorized the province to create its own ''R\u00e9gie des Rentes du Qu\u00e9bec'' (RRQ, Qu\u00e9bec Pension Plan); universal contributions came into effect in 1966. The [[Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec]] (CDPQ, Qu\u00e9bec Deposit and Investment Fund) was created in 1965 to manage the considerable revenues generated by the RRQ and to provide the capital necessary for various projects in the public and private sectors.\n\nA new labour code (''Code du Travail'') was adopted in 1964. It made unionizing much easier and gave public employees the right to strike. It was during the same year that the ''[[Civil Code of Quebec|Code Civil]]'' (Civil Code) was modified to recognize the legal equality of spouses.

The bill also restricted the eligibility for elementary and high school students to attend school in English, allowing this only for children of parents who had studied in English in Qu\u00e9bec.

Though the improvements made to Qu\u00e9bec society during this era make it seem like an extremely innovative period, it has been posited that these changes follow a logical revolutionary movement occurring throughout North America in the 1960s. Noted Qu\u00e9bec historian {{interlanguage link|Jacques Rouillard|fr|vertical-align=sup}} took this [[Historical revisionism|revisionist]] stance in arguing that the Quiet Revolution may have accelerated the natural evolution of Quebec\u2019s francophone society rather than having turned it on its head.<ref name=\"Jacques Rouillard\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hst.umontreal.ca/U/rouillard/revolutionrupture.htm |title=La r\u00e9volution tranquille, rupture ou tournant? |author=Jacques Rouillard |date=Winter 1998 |work=32:4 |publisher=Journal of Canadian Studies/Revue d\u2019\u00e9tudes canadiennes |accessdate=September 22, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514054757/http://www.hst.umontreal.ca/U/rouillard/revolutionrupture.htm |archivedate=May 14, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nSeveral arguments support this view. From an economic perspective, Quebec\u2019s manufacturing sector had seen important growth since the [[Industrial Revolution]].

He notes the popularity enjoyed by federal Liberal Prime Minister [[Sir Wilfrid Laurier]] as well as the Premiership of [[Ad\u00e9lard Godbout]] as examples of Qu\u00e9bec Liberalism prior to the events of the Quiet Revolution. The Godbout administration was extremely innovative.

{"title_page": "Arctic exploration", "text_new": "[[Image:Arctic.svg|thumb|300px|The Arctic region is within the red line]]\n'''Arctic exploration''' is the physical exploration of the [[Arctic]] region of the [[Earth]]. It refers to the historical period during which mankind has explored the region north of the [[Arctic Circle]]. Historical records suggest that humankind have explored the northern extremes since 325 BC, when the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] sailor [[Pytheas]] reached a frozen sea while attempting to find a source of the metal tin.<ref name=\"columbia\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.questia.com/library/encyclopedia/arctic_the.jsp|title=ARCTIC, THE|accessdate=2006-10-19|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2004|work=Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition}}{{dead link|date=February 2018}}</ref> Dangerous oceans and poor weather conditions often fetter explorers attempting to reach [[polar region]]s and journeying through these perils by sight, boat, and foot has proven difficult.<ref name=\"columbia\"/>\n\n==Ancient Greece==\nSome scholars believe that the first attempts to penetrate the Arctic Circle can be traced to ancient Greece and the sailor [[Pytheas]], a contemporary of [[Aristotle]] and [[Alexander the Great]], who, in 325 BC, attempted to find the source of the tin that would sporadically reach the Greek colony of Massilia (now [[Marseille]]) on the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] coast.<ref name=\"columbia\" /> Sailing past the [[Pillars of Hercules]], he reached [[Brittany]] and then [[Cornwall]], eventually circumnavigating the [[British Isles]]. From the local population, he heard news of the mysterious land of [[Thule]], even farther to the north. After six days of sailing, he reached land at the edge of a frozen sea (described by him as \"[[wiktionary:curdled|curdled]]\"), and described what is believed to be the [[Aurora (astronomy)|aurora]] and the [[midnight sun]]. Some historians claim that this new land of Thule was either the [[Norway|Norwegian]] coast or the [[Shetland|Shetland Islands]] based on his descriptions and the trade routes of early British sailors. While no one knows exactly how far Pytheas sailed, he may have crossed the Arctic Circle. Nevertheless, his tales were regarded as fantasy by later Greek and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] authorities, such as the geographer [[Strabo]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\n==The Middle Ages==\n[[Image:Vikings-Voyages.png|thumb|Viking sailors reached the White Sea and Greenland and North America]]\nThe first [[Viking]] to sight Iceland was [[Gardar Svavarsson]], who lost his route due to harsh conditions when sailing from Norway to the [[Faroe Islands]]. This quickly led to a wave of colonization.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Not all the settlers were successful however in the attempts to reach the island. In the 10th century, [[Gunnbj\u00f6rn Ulfsson]] got lost in a storm and ended up within sight of the [[Greenland]] coast. His report spurred [[Erik the Red]], an outlawed chieftain, to establish a settlement there in 985. While they flourished initially, these settlements eventually foundered due to changing climatic conditions (see [[Little Ice Age]]).{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} They are believed to have survived until around 1450.\n\nGreenland's early settlers sailed westward, in search of better [[pasture|pasturage]] and hunting grounds. Modern scholars debate the precise location of the new lands of [[Vinland]], [[Markland]], and [[Helluland]] that they discovered.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nThe [[Scandinavia]]n peoples also pushed farther north into their own peninsula by land and by sea. As early as 880, the Viking [[Ohthere of H\u00e5logaland]] rounded the [[Scandinavian Peninsula]] and sailed to the [[Kola Peninsula]] and the [[White Sea]]. The [[Pechenga Monastery]] on the north of Kola Peninsula was founded by Russian monks in 1533; from their base at [[Kola (town)|Kola]], the [[Pomors]] explored the [[Barents Region]], [[Spitsbergen]], and [[Novaya Zemlya]]\u2014all of which are in the Arctic Circle. They also explored north by boat, discovering the [[Northern Sea Route]], as well as penetrating to the trans-[[Ural Mountains|Ural]] areas of northern [[Siberia]]. They then founded the settlement of [[Mangazeya]] east of the [[Yamal Peninsula]] in the early 16th century.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} In 1648 the [[Cossacks|Cossack]] [[Semyon Dezhnyov]] opened the now famous [[Bering Strait]] between America and Asia.\n\nRussian [[settler]]s and traders on the coasts of the White Sea, the Pomors, had been exploring parts of the northeast passage as early as the 11th century. By the 17th century they established a continuous [[Trade route|sea route]] from [[Arkhangelsk]] as far east as the mouth of [[Yenisei River|Yenisey]]. This route, known as ''Mangazeya seaway'', after its eastern terminus, the trade depot of Mangazeya, was an early precursor to the Northern Sea Route.\n\n==Age of Discovery==\n{{See also|Age of Discovery}}\n[[File:1606 Mercator Hondius Map of the Arctic (First Map of the North Pole) - Geographicus - NorthPole-mercator-1606.jpg|thumb|Mercator's map of the North Pole (1606)]]\nExploration to the north of the Arctic Circle in the [[Renaissance]] was both driven by the rediscovery of the [[Classics]] and the national quests for commercial expansion, and hampered by limits in [[Shipbuilding#Early Modern|maritime technology]], lack of [[Shelf stable food|stable food]] supplies, and insufficient insulation for the crew against extreme cold.\n\n===Renaissance advancements in cartography===\n\n[[Image:John Cabot patent.jpg|thumb|Patent from King [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], authorizing [[John Cabot]] and his sons to explore new lands in the west]]\nA seminal event in Arctic exploration occurred in 1409, when [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geographia]]'' was translated into [[Latin]], thereby introducing the concepts of [[Geographic coordinate system|latitude and longitude]] into [[Western Europe]].<ref>[http://www.ibiblio.org/expo/vatican.exhibit/exhibit/d-mathematics/Ptolemy_geo.html Online Exhibit Rome Reborn: The Vatican Library and Renaissance Culture]</ref> Navigators were better able to chart their positions, and the [[Europe]]an race to [[China]], sparked by interest in the writings of [[Marco Polo]], commenced.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The ''[[Inventio Fortunata]]'', a [[Lost work|lost book]], describes in a summary written by Jacobus Cnoyen but only found in a letter from [[Gerardus Mercator]], voyages as far as the North Pole.<ref name=\"taylor\">{{Citation | last = Taylor | first = E.G.R. | author-link = Eva Germaine Rimington Taylor | title = A Letter Dated 1577 from Mercator to John Dee | journal = Imago Mundi | volume = 13 | pages = 56\u201368 | year = 1956 | doi = 10.1080/03085695608592127}}</ref> One widely disputed claim is that two brothers from [[Venice]], [[Zeno brothers|Niccolo and Antonio Zeno]], allegedly made a [[Zeno map|map]] of their journeys to that region, which were published by their descendants in 1558.<ref>[http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&id_nbr=592 \"Zeno, Nicolo and Antonio\" at the ''Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online'']</ref>\n\n=== Northwest Passage ===\n[[Image:northwest passage.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|The [[Northwest Passage]]]]\nThe [[Northwest Passage]] connects the [[Atlantic]] and [[Pacific Ocean]]s via the Arctic Ocean. Since the discovery of the [[American continent]] was the product of the search for a route to Asia, exploration around the northern edge of [[North America]] continued for the Northwest Passage. [[John Cabot]]'s initial failure in 1497 to find a Northwest Passage across the Atlantic led the British to seek an alternative route to the east.\n\nInterest re-kindled in 1564 after [[Jacques Cartier]]'s discovery of the mouth of the [[Saint Lawrence River]]. [[Martin Frobisher]] had formed a resolution to undertake the challenge of forging a trade route from England westward to India. From 1576 to 1578, he took three trips to what is now the [[Canadian Arctic]] in order to find the passage. [[Frobisher Bay]] is named after him. In July 1583, Sir [[Humphrey Gilbert]], who had written a treatise on the discovery of the passage and was a backer of Frobisher's, claimed the [[Newfoundland Colony|territory of Newfoundland]] for the English crown.\n\nIn 1585, under the employ of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], the English explorer [[John Davis (English explorer)|John Davis]] entered [[Cumberland Sound]], [[Baffin Island]]. Davis rounded Greenland before dividing his four ships into separate expeditions to search for a passage westward. Though he was unable to pass through the icy Arctic waters, he reported to his sponsors that the passage they sought is \"a matter nothing doubtfull {{sic}},\"{{uncited quote|date=February 2007}} and secured support for two additional expeditions, reaching as far as [[Hudson Bay]].\n\nThough England's efforts were interrupted in 1587 because of the [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585\u20131604)|Anglo-Spanish War]], Davis's favorable reports on the region and its people would inspire explorers in the coming century.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} In 1609, while in the service of the [[Dutch East India Company]], the English explorer [[Henry Hudson]] sailed up what is now called the [[Hudson River]] in search of the Passage; he reached present-day [[Albany, New York]], before giving up. He later explored further north into the Arctic and [[Hudson Bay]] for the Passage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/~cpercy/hell/anthology/travel/Travel1625Pricket.htm |title=Excerpt from A Larger Discourse of the Same Voyage |author= Abacuk Pricket |date=1625 |publisher=Chass.utoronto.ca |accessdate=February 19, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&id_nbr=343 |title=Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online |publisher=Biographi.ca |date= |accessdate=February 19, 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== The Northeast Passage ===\n{{Main|Northeast Passage}}\n{{See also|Northern Sea Route}}\n[[Image:Arctic 1644.jpg|thumb|200px|Jan Jansson's map of the \"Poli Arctici\" from 1644.]]\nThe Northeast Passage is a broad term for any route lying above the Eurasian continent and stretching between the waters north of the Norwegian Sea to the Bering Strait.  The \"Northern Sea Route\" is defined as a specific portion of such routes.  The ''Northern Sea Route'' (capitalized) as currently officially defined by Russian Federation law includes [[shipping]] lanes falling within Russia's EEZ and extending from the Kara Sea to the Bering Strait along the [[Russia]]n northern coast.\n\nThe idea to explore this region was initially economic, and was first put forward by Russian diplomat [[Dmitry Gerasimov]] in 1525. The entire route lies in Arctic waters and parts are only totally free of ice for about two months per year, making it a very perilous journey.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nIn the mid-16th century, John Cabot's son [[Sebastian Cabot (explorer)|Sebastian]] helped organize just such an expedition, led by Sir [[Hugh Willoughby]] and [[Richard Chancellor]]. Willoughby's crew was shipwrecked off the Kola Peninsula, where they eventually died of [[scurvy]]. Chancellor and his crew made it to the mouth of the [[Northern Dvina River|Dvina River]] and the town of Arkhangelsk, where they were met by a delegation from the [[Tsar]], [[Ivan IV of Russia|Ivan the Terrible]].

From the local population, he heard news of the mysterious land of [[Thule]], even farther to the north. After six days of sailing, he reached land at the edge of a frozen sea (described by him as \"[[wiktionary:curdled|curdled]]\"), and described what is believed to be the [[Aurora (astronomy)|aurora]] and the [[midnight sun]]. Some historians claim that this new land of Thule was either the [[Norway|Norwegian]] coast or the [[Shetland|Shetland Islands]] based on his descriptions and the trade routes of early British sailors. While no one knows exactly how far Pytheas sailed, he may have crossed the Arctic Circle.

This quickly led to a wave of colonization.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Not all the settlers were successful however in the attempts to reach the island. In the 10th century, [[Gunnbj\u00f6rn Ulfsson]] got lost in a storm and ended up within sight of the [[Greenland]] coast. His report spurred [[Erik the Red]], an outlawed chieftain, to establish a settlement there in 985. While they flourished initially, these settlements eventually foundered due to changing climatic conditions (see [[Little Ice Age]]).{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} They are believed to have survived until around 1450.\n\nGreenland's early settlers sailed westward, in search of better [[pasture|pasturage]] and hunting grounds.

As early as 880, the Viking [[Ohthere of H\u00e5logaland]] rounded the [[Scandinavian Peninsula]] and sailed to the [[Kola Peninsula]] and the [[White Sea]]. The [[Pechenga Monastery]] on the north of Kola Peninsula was founded by Russian monks in 1533; from their base at [[Kola (town)|Kola]], the [[Pomors]] explored the [[Barents Region]], [[Spitsbergen]], and [[Novaya Zemlya]]\u2014all of which are in the Arctic Circle. They also explored north by boat, discovering the [[Northern Sea Route]], as well as penetrating to the trans-[[Ural Mountains|Ural]] areas of northern [[Siberia]].

Since the discovery of the [[American continent]] was the product of the search for a route to Asia, exploration around the northern edge of [[North America]] continued for the Northwest Passage. [[John Cabot]]'s initial failure in 1497 to find a Northwest Passage across the Atlantic led the British to seek an alternative route to the east.\n\nInterest re-kindled in 1564 after [[Jacques Cartier]]'s discovery of the mouth of the [[Saint Lawrence River]]. [[Martin Frobisher]] had formed a resolution to undertake the challenge of forging a trade route from England westward to India. From 1576 to 1578, he took three trips to what is now the [[Canadian Arctic]] in order to find the passage. [[Frobisher Bay]] is named after him. In July 1583, Sir [[Humphrey Gilbert]], who had written a treatise on the discovery of the passage and was a backer of Frobisher's, claimed the [[Newfoundland Colony|territory of Newfoundland]] for the English crown.\n\nIn 1585, under the employ of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], the English explorer [[John Davis (English explorer)|John Davis]] entered [[Cumberland Sound]], [[Baffin Island]]. Davis rounded Greenland before dividing his four ships into separate expeditions to search for a passage westward. Though he was unable to pass through the icy Arctic waters, he reported to his sponsors that the passage they sought is \"a matter nothing doubtfull {{sic}},\"{{uncited quote|date=February 2007}} and secured support for two additional expeditions, reaching as far as [[Hudson Bay]].\n\nThough England's efforts were interrupted in 1587 because of the [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585\u20131604)|Anglo-Spanish War]], Davis's favorable reports on the region and its people would inspire explorers in the coming century.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} In 1609, while in the service of the [[Dutch East India Company]], the English explorer [[Henry Hudson]] sailed up what is now called the [[Hudson River]] in search of the Passage; he reached present-day [[Albany, New York]], before giving up.

The \"Northern Sea Route\" is defined as a specific portion of such routes.  The ''Northern Sea Route'' (capitalized) as currently officially defined by Russian Federation law includes [[shipping]] lanes falling within Russia's EEZ and extending from the Kara Sea to the Bering Strait along the [[Russia]]n northern coast.\n\nThe idea to explore this region was initially economic, and was first put forward by Russian diplomat [[Dmitry Gerasimov]] in 1525.

The Dutch were the first to undisputedly explore and chart coastlines of [[Jan Mayen#History|Jan Mayen]] and the [[History of Svalbard|Svalbard archipelago]] in the [[Arctic Ocean]].]]\n\nWestern parts of the passage were simultaneously being explored by Northern European countries like England, the Netherlands, Denmark and Norway, looking for an alternative seaway to China and India. Although these expeditions failed, new coasts and islands were discovered.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Most notable is the 1596 expedition led by Dutch navigator [[Willem Barentsz]] who discovered Spitsbergen and [[Bear Island (Norway)|Bear Island]].\n\nFearing English and Dutch penetration into Siberia, Russia closed the Mangazeya seaway in 1619. Pomor activity in Northern Asia declined and the bulk of exploration in the 17th century was carried out by Siberian Cossacks, sailing from one river mouth to another in their Arctic-worthy ''[[Koch (boat)|kochs]]''. In 1648 the most famous of these expeditions, led by Fedot Alekseev and [[Semyon Dezhnev]], sailed east from the mouth of [[Kolyma]] to the Pacific and doubled the [[Chukchi Peninsula]], thus proving that there was no land connection between Asia and North America.<ref>{{Cite book | last = Fisher | first = Raymond H | title = The Voyage of Semen Dezhnev in 1648 | publisher = The Hakluyt Society | year = 1981}}</ref> Eighty years after Dezhnev, in 1728, another Russian explorer, Danish-born [[Vitus Bering]] on ''Sviatoy Gavriil'' made a similar voyage in reverse, starting in [[Kamchatka Peninsula|Kamchatka]] and going north to the passage that now bears his name (Bering Strait).

American [[Frederick Cook]] claimed to have reached the North Pole in 1908, but this has not been widely accepted.<ref>See references on [[Frederick Cook]] for more information.</ref>\n\nOn May 9, 1926, Americans [[Richard E.

Nobile\u2019s second trip was in the airship ''[[Airship Italia|Italia]]'' that ran into a storm on the return trip and crashed on the ice. Survivors were eventually recovered. Amundsen disappeared, with the crew of his sea plane, during the rescue operations.\n\nThe first people to have without doubt walked on the North Pole were the Soviet party of 1948 under the command of Alexander Kuznetsov, who landed their aircraft nearby and walked to the pole.<ref name=\"Scott Polar\">Concise chronology of approach to the poles, Scott Polar Research Institute. retrieved 2010-06-04.</ref>\n\nOn August 3, 1958, the American submarine {{USS|Nautilus|SSN-571}} reached the North Pole without surfacing. It then proceeded to travel under the entire [[Polar ice cap]]. On March 17, 1959 the {{USS|Skate|SSN-578}} surfaced on the North Pole and dispersed the ashes of explorer Sir [[Hubert Wilkins]]. These journeys were part of military explorations stimulated by the [[Cold War]] context.\n\nOn April 19, 1968, [[Ralph Plaisted]] reached the North Pole via [[snowmobile]], the first surface traveler known with certainty to have done so. His position was verified independently by a [[United States Air Force|US Air Force]] meteorological overflight. In 1969 [[Wally Herbert]], on foot and by dog sled, became the first man to reach the North Pole on muscle power alone, on the 60th anniversary of Robert Peary's famous but disputed expedition.\n\nThe first persons to reach the North Pole on foot (or skis) and return with no outside help, no dogs, air planes, or re-supplies were [[Richard Weber (explorer)|Richard Weber]] ([[Canada]]) and Misha Malakhov (Russia) in 1995.

Javier Rodriguez Iglesias, {{a.k.a.}} DJ Linetech, produced their first few songs before he was replaced by Peter Goos. The repertoire mainly consisted of 1980s covers. Dancers Alex da Luz and Jorg Van der Heyden completed the original band setup. The group briefly changed their name to Basics (B6), with the additions of female singer CJ and dancer Sofie. As B6, they recorded their first official music video for a remix that Goos made of the [[Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark]] hit \"[[Enola Gay (song)|Enola Gay]]\", which was broadcast on Belgian television channel [[FilmNet]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gravitynoir.com/videos_90s/|title=Gravity Noir - Enola Gay (B6 featuring Patrick Knight)|date=1997|website=Gravity Noir|access-date=2019-12-01}}</ref> The band continued to record demos in the late 1990s under their independent labels Jumping Man Records<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/label/46485-Jumping-Man-Records|title=Jumping Man Records Label|last=Records|first=Jumping Man|date=1991|website=Discogs|access-date=2019-09-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190828032010/https://www.discogs.com/label/46485-Jumping-Man-Records|archive-date=2019-08-28|url-status=live}}</ref> and A Gravity Production.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/label/1092075-A-Gravity-Production/|title=A Gravity Production Label|last=Production|first=A Gravity|date=23 April 2011|website=Discogs|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190908035911/https://www.discogs.com/label/1092075-A-Gravity-Production|archive-date=8 September 2019|access-date=2019-08-06|url-status=live}}</ref> On 23 April 2011, a first official single called ''I've Got the Power'' was released, under the name of \"The Sisters of Divine Pleasure\", featuring Knight as [[drag queen]] Titless Strang\u00e9.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://open.spotify.com/album/3CK2ctdmagnuLWfFuQCALU?5=|title=I've got the power by Patrick Knight|date=23 April 2011|website=Spotify|access-date=2019-10-10}}</ref> In 2016, Knight decided to return to using the name Gravity Noir.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ascap.com/repertory#ace/search/performer/Gravity%20Noir/writer/Patrick%20Knight|title=ACE repertory|last=Gravity Noir|first=Patrick Knight|date=7 April 2016|website=ASCAP|access-date=2019-11-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200127100731/https://www.ascap.com/repertory#ace/search/performer/Gravity%20Noir/writer/Patrick%20Knight|archive-date=27 January 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Later years and up to present days ==\n[[File:Gravity Noir - Andrew Williams (Band member).jpg|thumb|Andrew Williams]] \nGravity Noir sought to offer members the opportunity to showcase their individual talents and creativity.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} Andrew Williams joined the band in 2016 as a vocalist and wind instrumentalist, and to provide graphic designs.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} Williams is an artistic painter from [[Wakefield]] in [[West Yorkshire]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.painters-online.co.uk/artists/andreww16/|title=Andrew Williams|last=on line|first=Painters|date=3 September 2012|website=painters-online|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191109115519/https://www.painters-online.co.uk/artists/andreww16/|archive-date=9 November 2019|access-date=2019-11-09|url-status=live}}</ref>{{relevance inline|date=March 2020}} Female lead singer Ambrosia Dash, who had lent her voice for Knight's solo projects, has sung several songs since Gravity Noir's comeback.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nAn official single and associated video clip called ''Mystery Knight''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://middeleeuwsterapel.nl/videoclip-gravity-noir/|title=Music Video Gravity Noir|last=Ter Apel|first=Middeleeuws|date=13 September 2016|website=Middeleeuws Ter Apel|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190723145134/https://middeleeuwsterapel.nl/videoclip-gravity-noir/|archive-date=23 July 2019|access-date=2019-07-23|url-status=live}}</ref> was released by Gravity Noir on 7&nbsp;April 2016.

It was released in January 1976 as the title track and opener of his tenth studio album ''[[Station to Station]]'', as well as on a promotional [[Gramophone record|7-inch single]] in France the same month. Co-produced by Bowie and [[Harry Maslin]], it was written and recorded at [[Cherokee Studios]] in Los Angeles between September and November 1975. At over 10&nbsp;minutes in length, it is Bowie's longest studio recording. Opening with a train-like noise, the song's first half is a slow march, built around an atonal guitar riff, while the second half takes the form of a [[Progressive rock|prog]]-[[disco]] suite that's in a different key and tempo than the first. The song dabbles in [[art rock]] and is influenced by the German electronic bands [[Kraftwerk]] and [[Tangerine Dream]].\n\nLyrically, the song introduces Bowie's sinister persona [[the Thin White Duke]], who became the mouthpiece for ''Station to Station'' and, throughout 1976, often the embodiment of Bowie himself. During the recording, Bowie was heavily dependent on drugs such as [[cocaine]], which is referenced directly throughout the song. \"Station to Station\" also makes references to the [[Kabbalah]], [[occultism]], [[gnosticism]], [[paranoia]] and other fixations that affected Bowie's mind at the time. The opening sound effect is a [[red herring]] meant to represent the [[Stations of the Cross]], along with a juncture connecting two different stages of his career; it combined the [[funk]] and [[Soul music|soul]] of his previous album ''[[Young Americans]]'' with the experimental sound he would take on his [[Berlin Trilogy]].\n\n\"Station to Station\" has received acclaim from music critics, who have praised the performance of the band and Bowie himself. Retrospectively, it has been named one of Bowie's greatest songs and, like its parent album, is seen as the indicator of where Bowie's career was heading at the time. He performed the track throughout the [[Isolar \u2013 1976 Tour|1976 Isolar Tour]], often in character as the Thin White Duke, and continued to perform it on different tours throughout his career. It was remastered, along with its parent album, as part of the box set ''[[Who Can I Be Now? (1974\u20131976)]]'' in 2016.\n\n==Composition==\n\"Station to Station\" was recorded at [[Cherokee Studios]] in Los Angeles between September and November 1975.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=285}} During the song's recording, Bowie starved himself of all nutrients except [[milk]], red peppers, and [[cocaine]].<ref name=\"NME\">{{cite web |last1=Barker |first1=Emily |title=David Bowie's 40 greatest songs \u2013 as decided by ''NME'' and friends |url=https://www.nme.com/photos/david-bowie-s-40-greatest-songs-as-decided-by-nme-and-friends-1418012 |website=[[NME]] |accessdate=16 February 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20191103063248/https://www.nme.com/photos/david-bowie-s-40-greatest-songs-as-decided-by-nme-and-friends-1418012 |archivedate=3 November 2019 |date=8 January 2018}}</ref> Bowie would recall later that he could not remember recording the album at all, other than a memory of standing with lead guitarist [[Earl Slick]] in the studio and asking him to play a [[Chuck Berry]]-style riff in the same key throughout the opening of \"Station to Station\".{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=234}} At over 10 minutes in length, it is Bowie's longest studio recording.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=467}} Structurally, the song builds from a droning, guitar-driven introductory portion that mimics a train building up speed.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=78\u201380}} Following the train noise, the band begins to awaken, with percussion and keyboards playing chords in and out of key before the entire band erupts.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=287}} What follows is a \"slow, hypnotic instrumental march\", led by an atonal guitar riff played by Bowie and Slick with syncopated accents across three bars in {{music|time|4|4}} and one in {{music|time|2|4}}.<ref name=\"Light RS\" />{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=287}} The march lasts for more than three minutes before Bowie begins his vocals.<ref name=\"Light RS\" /> After several verses, at the five-minute mark, a thud of drums signals a change of tempo and key and the band erupts into a prog-disco \"celebratory groove\" which lasts for the rest of the track.<ref name=\"Light RS\" /><ref name=\"Needham Guardian\">{{cite web |last1=Needham |first1=Alex |title=My favorite album: ''Station to Station'' by David Bowie |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/sep/16/station-station-david-bowie |website=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=14 March 2020 |date=16 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190406095256/https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/sep/16/station-station-david-bowie |archive-date=6 April 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=288}} Doggett likens the section to a [[progressive rock]] suite by the 1970s bands [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] and [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]].{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=287}} Like the album, the entire song dabbles in [[art rock]].<ref name=\"AllMusic album\">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/station-to-station-mw0000098920|title=''Station to Station'' \u2013 David Bowie {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=1 August 2019|quote=At its heart, ''Station to Station'' is an avant-garde art-rock album, most explicitly on 'TVC 15' and the epic sprawl of the title track|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190424115507/https://www.allmusic.com/album/station-to-station-mw0000098920|archive-date=24 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe train sound effect was created by Slick using [[Flanging|flangers]] and delay effects.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=78\u201380}}{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=287}} The noise pans from right to left across the stereo channels before \"disappearing into a tunnel\" using [[feedback]].{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=287}} According to biographer [[Nicholas Pegg]], the effect \"acknowledges\" the influence of the 1974 album ''[[Autobahn (album)|Autobahn]]'' by the German [[Electronic music|electronic]] band [[Kraftwerk]], which begins with a car starting up and driving across the stereo speakers.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} Pegg believes another influence is from [[Edgar Froese]] of the German electronic band [[Tangerine Dream]], whom Bowie befriended during his \"Berlin\" years; Froese's 1975 album ''[[Epsilon in Malaysian Pale]]'' also begins with a train sound effect.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} However, he notes that the train is a [[red herring]] in that it expresses what Bowie later called \"the album's 'wayward spiritual search'.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} More specifically, it reinstates the \"travelling metaphor\" of earlier compositions: \"the stations recall the 'new surroundings' of \"[[Rock 'n' Roll with Me]]\" [from ''[[Diamond Dogs]]''], and the \"mountains on mountains\" reprise the questing motifs of \"[[Wild Eyed Boy from Freecloud]]\" [from ''[[David Bowie (1969 album)|David Bowie]]'' (1969)] and ''[[The Man Who Sold the World]]''.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} Bowie would later state, \"the 'Station to Station' track itself is very much concerned with the [[Stations of the Cross]]\",<ref name=Q97X /> the sequence of 14 landmarks on [[Jesus|Christ]]'s path to the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]], each a symbolic stopping-point for prayer.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} Stuart Berman of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' supports this, saying: \"the title track's momentous prog-disco suite&nbsp;[...] charts a course from spiritual void toward ecstatic religious reawakening.\"<ref name=\"Berman Pitchfork\">{{cite web|last=Berman|first=Stuart|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14687-station-to-station-deluxe-edition/|title=David Bowie: ''Station to Station'' (Deluxe Edition)|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|date=29 September 2010|accessdate=22 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101021073153/http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14687-station-to-station-deluxe-edition/|archive-date=21 October 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> Another possible influence is guitarist [[Jimmy Page]] of the English rock band [[Led Zeppelin]]. Page was a session musician on Bowie's earliest recordings and had been an occasional acquaintance ever since.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=469}} During the same time Bowie became dependant on cocaine, Page had become dependant on [[heroin]] which, according to Pegg, was \"even more fearful\" than Bowie's addiction.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=469}} Led Zeppelin's ''[[Physical Graffiti]]'' was released in March 1975,<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=Physical Graffiti|others=[[Led Zeppelin]]|year=1975|publisher=[[Swan Song Records]]|location=UK|type=liner notes|id=SSK 894007}}</ref> months ahead of the ''Station to Station'' sessions.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=469}} Pegg writes: \"It's possible to discern in [\"Station to Station\"] a distinct flavour of the groove, tempo and sense of building tension created by the famous rising riff of ''Physical Graffiti''<nowiki/>'s standout track '[[Kashmir (song)|Kashmir]]'\", an epic track that evokes a \"troubled spiritual journey\" through its music and lyrics.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=469}}\n\n==Lyrics==\n[[File:The Thin White Duke 76.jpg|thumb|160px|left|alt=David Bowie performing in 1976 and in character as the Thin White Duke|Bowie in character as the Thin White Duke performing on the [[Isolar \u2013 1976 Tour|1976 Isolar Tour]].]]\n\"Station to Station\" introduces Bowie's persona [[the Thin White Duke]], a sinister figure who became the mouthpiece for ''Station to Station'' and, often throughout 1976, for Bowie himself.<ref>{{cite web |last=Light |first=Alan |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/how-david-bowie-brought-thin-white-duke-to-life-on-station-to-station-125797/ |title=How David Bowie Brought Thin White Duke to Life on 'Station to Station' |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=26 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181227040904/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/how-david-bowie-brought-thin-white-duke-to-life-on-station-to-station-125797/ |archive-date=27 December 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=467}} The persona was noticeably darker than Bowie's previous characters, being described as \"a mad aristocrat\",{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=78\u201380}} an \"amoral zombie\",{{sfn|Buckley|2000|p=258}} and \"an emotionless ''[[Aryan race|Aryan]]'' superman\".{{sfn|Pegg|2004|pp=297\u2013300}} For Bowie himself, the Duke was \"a nasty character indeed\".{{sfn|Wilcken|2005|p=24}} The lyrics themselves contain very cryptic messages. Author [[Peter Doggett]] believes the main themes of the track are magic, the arts of legendary musicians, both real and fictitious, the [[Kabbalah]]'s mythical account of progress from Kether to Malkuth, love and cocaine.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=286}} Doggett further argues: \"just as [the ''[[Hunky Dory]]'' track] \"[[Quicksand (David Bowie song)|Quicksand]]\" offered a catalogue of avenues open to the inquisitive imagination of David Bowie circa 1971, so \"Station to Station\" present a more confused medley of the themes that were haunting his nightmares in the final weeks of 1975.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=286}}\n\nThe Duke introduces himself by saying \"the return of the Thin White Duke/throwing darts in lovers' eyes.\"<ref name=\"Needham Guardian\" /> Darts, or arrows, are interpreted to be a symbol of direction revealing the dynamic of the True Will.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=286}} Doggett argues that other than the Thin White Duke, another duke was at the heart of the action: [[Prospero]], the Duke of [[Milan]] and protagonist of [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[The Tempest]]''.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=285}} He writes that Prospero, like the Thin White Duke, is a \"master of magic\", who can control elements while \"lost in my [magic] circle\", as well as cast spells over \"lovers' eyes\" (mirroring throwing darts), as Prospero does with his daughter [[Miranda (The Tempest)|Miranda]] and her lover [[Ferdinand (The Tempest)|Ferdinand]] over the course of the play.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|pp=285\u2013286}} Fixation with the English [[occultist]] [[Aleister Crowley]] is evident in such phrases as \"[[White Stains|white stains]]\", the name of a book of poetry by Crowley,{{sfn|Wilcken|2005|p=7}} who was previously mentioned by Bowie on \"Quicksand\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=469}} Other references include the 13th century Jewish mystical system known as the Kabbalah and [[gnosticism]].<ref name=Q97X>{{cite book| last=Cavanagh | first=David | title=ChangesFiftyBowie | journal=[[Q (magazine)|Q magazine]] |date=February 1997 | pages=52\u201359}}</ref> Bowie would later claim in 1997: \"All the references within [\"Station to Station\"] have to do with the Kabbalah.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=286}} Once the song changes into the prog-disco section, the lyrics become brighter. Punctuated by the refrain \"It's too late\",{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=78\u201380}} Bowie enters a landscape of \"mountains and sunbirds\".{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=288}} Themes in this section include drug use, as presented in the lyrics \"It's not the side effects of the cocaine/I'm thinking that it must be love\",{{sfn|Wilcken|2005|p=9}} which he sings in a joyous tone.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=288}} Other themes present on the track are [[paranoia]] and odd fixations that were present in Bowie's mind at the time are also recurring themes.<ref name=\"Light RS\" /> At different points Bowie declares \"the European canon (or cannon) is here\", which Doggett believes is a \"pretentious way\" of summarising Bowie's interest in Kraftwerk and [[Brechtian]] theatre.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=286}}\n\n==Release and reception==\n\"Station to Station\" was released as the opening title track to Bowie's tenth studio album [[Station to Station|of the same name]] on 23&nbsp;January 1976.<ref name=\"AllMusic album\" /><ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=Station to Station|others=[[David Bowie]]|year=1976|publisher=[[RCA Records|RCA Victor]]|location=UK|type=liner notes|id=APL1 1327}}</ref> The song was also released as a [[promotional single]] (as 42549 A) in January 1976 in France by [[RCA Records]], with a shortened duration of&nbsp;3:40 and \"[[TVC 15]]\" as the B-side.<ref name=\"single liner notes\" /> The single version begins at the central section of the song with the drums just prior to the \"once there were mountains...\" lyric.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=470}} The single edit appears on the 2010 Deluxe Edition of ''[[Station to Station]]'' and on ''Re:Call&nbsp;2'', as part of the 2016 box set ''[[Who Can I Be Now?

It was released in January 1976 as the title track and opener of his tenth studio album ''[[Station to Station]]'', as well as on a promotional [[Gramophone record|7-inch single]] in France the same month. Co-produced by Bowie and [[Harry Maslin]], it was written and recorded at [[Cherokee Studios]] in Los Angeles between September and November 1975. At over 10&nbsp;minutes in length, it is Bowie's longest studio recording. Opening with a train-like noise, the song's first half is a slow march, built around an atonal guitar riff, while the second half takes the form of a [[Progressive rock|prog]]-[[disco]] suite that's in a different key and tempo than the first. The song dabbles in [[art rock]] and is influenced by the German electronic bands [[Kraftwerk]] and [[Tangerine Dream]].\n\nLyrically, the song introduces Bowie's sinister persona [[the Thin White Duke]], who became the mouthpiece for ''Station to Station'' and, throughout 1976, often the embodiment of Bowie himself. During the recording, Bowie was heavily dependent on drugs such as [[cocaine]], which is referenced directly throughout the song. \"Station to Station\" also makes references to the [[Kabbalah]], [[occultism]], [[gnosticism]], [[paranoia]] and other fixations that affected Bowie's mind at the time. The opening sound effect is a [[red herring]] meant to represent the [[Stations of the Cross]], along with a juncture connecting two different stages of his career; it combined the [[funk]] and [[Soul music|soul]] of his previous album ''[[Young Americans]]'' with the experimental sound he would take on his [[Berlin Trilogy]].\n\n\"Station to Station\" has received acclaim from music critics, who have praised the performance of the band and Bowie himself. Retrospectively, it has been named one of Bowie's greatest songs and, like its parent album, is seen as the indicator of where Bowie's career was heading at the time. He performed the track throughout the [[Isolar \u2013 1976 Tour|1976 Isolar Tour]], often in character as the Thin White Duke, and continued to perform it on different tours throughout his career. It was remastered, along with its parent album, as part of the box set ''[[Who Can I Be Now? (1974\u20131976)]]'' in 2016.\n\n==Composition==\n\"Station to Station\" was recorded at [[Cherokee Studios]] in Los Angeles between September and November 1975.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=285}} During the song's recording, Bowie starved himself of all nutrients except [[milk]], red peppers, and [[cocaine]].<ref name=\"NME\">{{cite web |last1=Barker |first1=Emily |title=David Bowie's 40 greatest songs \u2013 as decided by ''NME'' and friends |url=https://www.nme.com/photos/david-bowie-s-40-greatest-songs-as-decided-by-nme-and-friends-1418012 |website=[[NME]] |accessdate=16 February 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20191103063248/https://www.nme.com/photos/david-bowie-s-40-greatest-songs-as-decided-by-nme-and-friends-1418012 |archivedate=3 November 2019 |date=8 January 2018}}</ref> Bowie would recall later that he could not remember recording the album at all, other than a memory of standing with lead guitarist [[Earl Slick]] in the studio and asking him to play a [[Chuck Berry]]-style riff in the same key throughout the opening of \"Station to Station\".{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=234}} At over 10 minutes in length, it is Bowie's longest studio recording.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=467}} Structurally, the song builds from a droning, guitar-driven introductory portion that mimics a train building up speed.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=78\u201380}} Following the train noise, the band begins to awaken, with percussion and keyboards playing chords in and out of key before the entire band erupts.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=287}} What follows is a \"slow, hypnotic instrumental march\", led by an atonal guitar riff played by Bowie and Slick with syncopated accents across three bars in {{music|time|4|4}} and one in {{music|time|2|4}}.<ref name=\"Light RS\" />{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=287}} The march lasts for more than three minutes before Bowie begins his vocals.<ref name=\"Light RS\" /> After several verses, at the five-minute mark, a thud of drums signals a change of tempo and key and the band erupts into a prog-disco \"celebratory groove\" which lasts for the rest of the track.<ref name=\"Light RS\" /><ref name=\"Needham Guardian\">{{cite web |last1=Needham |first1=Alex |title=My favorite album: ''Station to Station'' by David Bowie |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/sep/16/station-station-david-bowie |website=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=14 March 2020 |date=16 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190406095256/https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/sep/16/station-station-david-bowie |archive-date=6 April 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=288}} Doggett likens the section to a [[progressive rock]] suite by the 1970s bands [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] and [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]].{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=287}} Like the album, the entire song dabbles in [[art rock]].<ref name=\"AllMusic album\">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/station-to-station-mw0000098920|title=''Station to Station'' \u2013 David Bowie {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=1 August 2019|quote=At its heart, ''Station to Station'' is an avant-garde art-rock album, most explicitly on 'TVC 15' and the epic sprawl of the title track|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190424115507/https://www.allmusic.com/album/station-to-station-mw0000098920|archive-date=24 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe train sound effect was created by Slick using [[Flanging|flangers]] and delay effects.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=78\u201380}}{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=287}} The noise pans from right to left across the stereo channels before \"disappearing into a tunnel\" using [[feedback]].{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=287}} According to biographer [[Nicholas Pegg]], the effect \"acknowledges\" the influence of the 1974 album ''[[Autobahn (album)|Autobahn]]'' by the German [[Electronic music|electronic]] band [[Kraftwerk]], which begins with a car starting up and driving across the stereo speakers.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} Pegg believes another influence is from [[Edgar Froese]] of the German electronic band [[Tangerine Dream]], whom Bowie befriended during his \"Berlin\" years; Froese's 1975 album ''[[Epsilon in Malaysian Pale]]'' also begins with a train sound effect.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} However, he notes that the train is a [[red herring]] in that it expresses what Bowie later called \"the album's 'wayward spiritual search'.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} More specifically, it reinstates the \"travelling metaphor\" of earlier compositions: \"the stations recall the 'new surroundings' of \"[[Rock 'n' Roll with Me]]\" [from ''[[Diamond Dogs]]''], and the \"mountains on mountains\" reprise the questing motifs of \"[[Wild Eyed Boy from Freecloud]]\" [from ''[[David Bowie (1969 album)|David Bowie]]'' (1969)] and ''[[The Man Who Sold the World]]''.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} Bowie would later state, \"the 'Station to Station' track itself is very much concerned with the [[Stations of the Cross]]\",<ref name=Q97X /> the sequence of 14 landmarks on [[Jesus|Christ]]'s path to the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]], each a symbolic stopping-point for prayer.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} Stuart Berman of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' supports this, saying: \"the title track's momentous prog-disco suite&nbsp;[...] charts a course from spiritual void toward ecstatic religious reawakening.\"<ref name=\"Berman Pitchfork\">{{cite web|last=Berman|first=Stuart|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14687-station-to-station-deluxe-edition/|title=David Bowie: ''Station to Station'' (Deluxe Edition)|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|date=29 September 2010|accessdate=22 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101021073153/http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14687-station-to-station-deluxe-edition/|archive-date=21 October 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> Another possible influence is guitarist [[Jimmy Page]] of the English rock band [[Led Zeppelin]]. Page was a session musician on Bowie's earliest recordings and had been an occasional acquaintance ever since.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=469}} During the same time Bowie became dependant on cocaine, Page had become dependant on [[heroin]] which, according to Pegg, was \"even more fearful\" than Bowie's addiction.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=469}} Led Zeppelin's ''[[Physical Graffiti]]'' was released in March 1975,<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=Physical Graffiti|others=[[Led Zeppelin]]|year=1975|publisher=[[Swan Song Records]]|location=UK|type=liner notes|id=SSK 894007}}</ref> months ahead of the ''Station to Station'' sessions.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=469}} Pegg writes: \"It's possible to discern in [\"Station to Station\"] a distinct flavour of the groove, tempo and sense of building tension created by the famous rising riff of ''Physical Graffiti''<nowiki/>'s standout track '[[Kashmir (song)|Kashmir]]'\", an epic track that evokes a \"troubled spiritual journey\" through its music and lyrics.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=469}}\n\n==Lyrics==\n[[File:The Thin White Duke 76.jpg|thumb|160px|left|alt=David Bowie performing in 1976 and in character as the Thin White Duke|Bowie in character as the Thin White Duke performing on the [[Isolar \u2013 1976 Tour|1976 Isolar Tour]].]]\n\"Station to Station\" introduces Bowie's persona [[the Thin White Duke]], a sinister figure who became the mouthpiece for ''Station to Station'' and, often throughout 1976, for Bowie himself.<ref>{{cite web |last=Light |first=Alan |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/how-david-bowie-brought-thin-white-duke-to-life-on-station-to-station-125797/ |title=How David Bowie Brought Thin White Duke to Life on 'Station to Station' |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=26 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181227040904/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/how-david-bowie-brought-thin-white-duke-to-life-on-station-to-station-125797/ |archive-date=27 December 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=467}} The persona was noticeably darker than Bowie's previous characters, being described as \"a mad aristocrat\",{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=78\u201380}} an \"amoral zombie\",{{sfn|Buckley|2000|p=258}} and \"an emotionless ''[[Aryan race|Aryan]]'' superman\".{{sfn|Pegg|2004|pp=297\u2013300}} For Bowie himself, the Duke was \"a nasty character indeed\".{{sfn|Wilcken|2005|p=24}} The lyrics themselves contain very cryptic messages.

Punctuated by the refrain \"It's too late\",{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=78\u201380}} Bowie enters a landscape of \"mountains and sunbirds\".{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=288}} Themes in this section include drug use, as presented in the lyrics \"It's not the side effects of the cocaine/I'm thinking that it must be love\",{{sfn|Wilcken|2005|p=9}} which he sings in a joyous tone.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=288}} Other themes present on the track are [[paranoia]] and odd fixations that were present in Bowie's mind at the time are also recurring themes.<ref name=\"Light RS\" /> At different points Bowie declares \"the European canon (or cannon) is here\", which Doggett believes is a \"pretentious way\" of summarising Bowie's interest in Kraftwerk and [[Brechtian]] theatre.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=286}}\n\n==Release and reception==\n\"Station to Station\" was released as the opening title track to Bowie's tenth studio album [[Station to Station|of the same name]] on 23&nbsp;January 1976.<ref name=\"AllMusic album\" /><ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=Station to Station|others=[[David Bowie]]|year=1976|publisher=[[RCA Records|RCA Victor]]|location=UK|type=liner notes|id=APL1 1327}}</ref> The song was also released as a [[promotional single]] (as 42549 A) in January 1976 in France by [[RCA Records]], with a shortened duration of&nbsp;3:40 and \"[[TVC 15]]\" as the B-side.<ref name=\"single liner notes\" /> The single version begins at the central section of the song with the drums just prior to the \"once there were mountains...\" lyric.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=470}} The single edit appears on the 2010 Deluxe Edition of ''[[Station to Station]]'' and on ''Re:Call&nbsp;2'', as part of the 2016 box set ''[[Who Can I Be Now?
