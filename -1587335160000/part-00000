Watergate prosecutor James Neal was sure that Nixon had not known in advance of the break-in. As evidence, he cited a conversation taped on June 23 between the President and his Chief of Staff, [[H.

Made out to the Finance Committee of the Committee to Reelect the President, the check was a 1972 campaign donation by [[Kenneth H. Dahlberg#Watergate|Kenneth H. Dahlberg]]. This money (and several other checks which had been lawfully donated to the CRP) had been directly used to finance the burglary and wiretapping expenses, including hardware and supplies.\n\nMr. Barker's multiple national and international businesses all had separate bank accounts, which he was found to have attempted to use to disguise the true origin of the money being paid to the burglars. The donor's checks demonstrated the burglars' direct link to the finance committee of the CRP.\n\nDonations totalling $86,000 (${{Inflation|US|86000|1972|r=-3|fmt=c}} today) were made by individuals who were deluded that they were making private donations by certified and cashier's checks for the president's re-election. Investigators' examination of the bank records of a Miami company run by Watergate burglar Barker revealed an account controlled by him personally had deposited a check and then transferred it (through the [[Federal Reserve System#Check clearing system|Federal Reserve Check Clearing System]]).\n\nThe banks that had originated the checks were keen to ensure the depository institution used by Barker had acted properly in ensuring the checks had been received and endorsed by the check's payee, before its acceptance for deposit in Bernard Barker's account. Only in this way would the issuing banks not be held liable for the unauthorized and improper release of funds from their customers' accounts.\n\nThe investigation by the FBI, which cleared Barker's bank of fiduciary malfeasance, led to the direct implication of members of the CRP, to whom the checks had been delivered. Those individuals were the Committee bookkeeper and its treasurer, [[Hugh Sloan]].\n\nAs a private organization, the committee followed the normal business practice in allowing only duly authorized individuals to accept and endorse checks on behalf of the Committee. No financial institution could accept or process a check on behalf of the committee unless a duly authorized individual endorsed it. The checks deposited into Barker's bank account were endorsed by Committee treasurer Hugh Sloan, who was authorized by the Finance Committee. However, once Sloan had endorsed a check made payable to the Committee, he had a legal and fiduciary responsibility to see that the check was deposited only into the accounts named on the check. Sloan failed to do that. When confronted with the potential charge of federal bank fraud, he revealed that committee deputy director [[Jeb Magruder]] and finance director [[Maurice Stans]] had directed him to give the money to [[G. Gordon Liddy]].\n\nLiddy, in turn, gave the money to Barker and attempted to hide its origin. Barker tried to disguise the funds by depositing them into accounts in banks outside of the United States. Unbeknownst to Barker, Liddy, and Sloan, the complete record of all such transactions was held for roughly six months. Barker's use of foreign banks in April and May 1972, to deposit checks and withdraw the funds via cashier's checks and money orders, resulted in the banks keeping the entire transaction records until October and November 1972.\n\nAll five Watergate burglars were directly or indirectly tied to the 1972 CRP, thus causing Judge Sirica to suspect a conspiracy involving higher-echelon government officials.<ref>Quote: \"There were still simply too many unanswered questions in the case. By that time, thinking about the break-in and reading about it, I'd have had to be some kind of moron to believe that no other people were involved.

On October 10, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein reported that the FBI had determined that the Watergate break-in was part of a massive campaign of political spying and sabotage on behalf of the Nixon re-election committee. Despite these revelations, Nixon's campaign was never seriously jeopardized; on November 7, the [[1972 United States presidential election|President was re-elected]] in one of the biggest landslides in American political history.\n\n===Role of the media===\nThe connection between the break-in and the re-election committee was highlighted by media coverage\u2014in particular, investigative coverage by ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', and ''[[The New York Times]]''. The coverage dramatically increased publicity and consequent political and legal repercussions. Relying heavily upon [[anonymous sources]], ''Post'' reporters [[Bob Woodward]] and [[Carl Bernstein]] uncovered information suggesting that knowledge of the break-in, and attempts to cover it up, led deeply into the upper reaches of the Justice Department, FBI, CIA, and the White House. Woodward and Bernstein interviewed [[Judy Hoback Miller]], the bookkeeper for Nixon's re-election campaign, who revealed to them information about the mishandling of funds and records being destroyed.<ref>[http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2012/06/woodward-and-bernstein-downplay-deep-throat-125950.html \"Woodward Downplays Deep Throat\"], Politico.com blog, June 2012.

Felt warned Woodward that the FBI wanted to know where he and other reporters were getting their information, as they were uncovering a wider web of crimes than the FBI first disclosed.

Recorded only a few days after the break-in, it documented the initial stages of the cover-up: it revealed Nixon and Haldeman had conducted a meeting in the Oval Office where they discussed how to stop the FBI from continuing their investigation of the break-in, as they recognised that there was a high risk that their position in the scandal may be revealed.\n\nHaldeman introduced the topic as follows:\n\n<blockquote>...{{nbsp}}the Democratic break-in thing, we're back to the\u2014in the, the problem area because the FBI is not under control, because [[L. Patrick Gray|Gray]] doesn't exactly know how to control them, and they have&nbsp;... their investigation is now leading into some productive areas&nbsp;... and it goes in some directions we don't want it to go.<ref name=\"haldeman6.23.72\" /></blockquote>\n[[File:Members and staff of House Judiciary Committee 1974.png|thumb|left|upright=1.35|House Judiciary Committee members and staff, 1974]]\n\nAfter explaining how the money from CRP was traced to the burglars, Haldeman explained to Nixon the cover-up plan: \"the way to handle this now is for us to have Walters [CIA] call Pat Gray [FBI] and just say, 'Stay the hell out of this&nbsp;... this is ah, business here we don't want you to go any further on it.'\"<ref name=\"haldeman6.23.72\" />\n\nNixon approved the plan, and after he was given more information about the involvement of his campaign in the break-in, he told Haldeman: \"All right, fine, I understand it all. We won't second-guess Mitchell and the rest.\" Returning to the use of the CIA to obstruct the FBI, he instructed Haldeman: \"You call them in. Good. Good deal. Play it tough. That's the way they play it and that's the way we are going to play it.\"<ref name=\"haldeman6.23.72\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.nixonlibrary.gov/forresearchers/find/tapes/watergate/wspf/741-002.pdf |title=\"Transcript of a Recording of a Meeting Between the President and H.R.

He claimed that there were no political motivations in his instructions to the CIA, and claimed he had no knowledge before March 21, 1973, of involvement by senior campaign officials such as [[John N. Mitchell|John Mitchell]]. The contents of this tape persuaded Nixon's own lawyers, [[Fred Buzhardt]] and [[James D.

Throughout the long and difficult period of Watergate, I have felt it was my duty to persevere, to make every possible effort to complete the term of office to which you elected me. In the past few days, however, it has become evident to me that I no longer have a strong enough political base in the Congress to justify continuing that effort. As long as there was such a base, I felt strongly that it was necessary to see the constitutional process through to its conclusion, that to do otherwise would be unfaithful to the spirit of that deliberately difficult process and a dangerously destabilizing precedent for the future.\n\n...&nbsp;I would have preferred to carry through to the finish whatever the personal agony it would have involved, and my family unanimously urged me to do so. But the interest of the Nation must always come before any personal considerations. From the discussions I have had with Congressional and other leaders, I have concluded that because of the Watergate matter I might not have the support of the Congress that I would consider necessary to back the very difficult decisions and carry out the duties of this office in the way the interests of the Nation would require.\n\n...&nbsp;''I have never been a quitter''. To leave office before my term is completed is abhorrent to every instinct in my body. But as President, I must put the interest of America first. America needs a full-time President and a full-time Congress, particularly at this time with problems we face at home and abroad. To continue to fight through the months ahead for my personal vindication would almost totally absorb the time and attention of both the President and the Congress in a period when our entire focus should be on the great issues of peace abroad and prosperity without inflation at home. Therefore, I shall resign the Presidency effective at noon tomorrow.

The Democrats gained five seats in the Senate and forty-nine in the House (the newcomers were nicknamed \"[[Watergate Babies]]\").

O'Brien was elected national chairman of the DNC in 1968 and 1970. In late 1971, the president's brother, [[Donald Nixon]], was collecting intelligence for his brother at the time and asked [[John H.

The loan's existence surfaced during the [[1960 United States presidential election|1960 presidential election]] campaign, embarrassing Richard Nixon and becoming a political liability.

Made out to the Finance Committee of the Committee to Reelect the President, the check was a 1972 campaign donation by [[Kenneth H. Dahlberg#Watergate|Kenneth H. Dahlberg]]. This money (and several other checks which had been lawfully donated to the CRP) had been directly used to finance the burglary and wiretapping expenses, including hardware and supplies.\n\nMr. Barker's multiple national and international businesses all had separate bank accounts, which he was found to have attempted to use to disguise the true origin of the money being paid to the burglars. The donor's checks demonstrated the burglars' direct link to the finance committee of the CRP.\n\nDonations totalling $86,000 (${{Inflation|US|86000|1972|r=-3|fmt=c}} today) were made by individuals who were deluded that they were making private donations by certified and cashier's checks for the president's re-election. Investigators' examination of the bank records of a Miami company run by Watergate burglar Barker revealed an account controlled by him personally had deposited a check and then transferred it (through the [[Federal Reserve System#Check clearing system|Federal Reserve Check Clearing System]]).\n\nThe banks that had originated the checks were keen to ensure the depository institution used by Barker had acted properly in ensuring the checks had been received and endorsed by the check's payee, before its acceptance for deposit in Bernard Barker's account. Only in this way would the issuing banks not be held liable for the unauthorized and improper release of funds from their customers' accounts.\n\nThe investigation by the FBI, which cleared Barker's bank of fiduciary malfeasance, led to the direct implication of members of the CRP, to whom the checks had been delivered. Those individuals were the Committee bookkeeper and its treasurer, [[Hugh Sloan]].\n\nAs a private organization, the committee followed the normal business practice in allowing only duly authorized individuals to accept and endorse checks on behalf of the Committee. No financial institution could accept or process a check on behalf of the committee unless a duly authorized individual endorsed it. The checks deposited into Barker's bank account were endorsed by Committee treasurer Hugh Sloan, who was authorized by the Finance Committee. However, once Sloan had endorsed a check made payable to the Committee, he had a legal and fiduciary responsibility to see that the check was deposited only into the accounts named on the check. Sloan failed to do that. When confronted with the potential charge of federal bank fraud, he revealed that committee deputy director [[Jeb Magruder]] and finance director [[Maurice Stans]] had directed him to give the money to [[G. Gordon Liddy]].\n\nLiddy, in turn, gave the money to Barker and attempted to hide its origin. Barker tried to disguise the funds by depositing them into accounts in banks outside of the United States. Unbeknownst to Barker, Liddy, and Sloan, the complete record of all such transactions was held for roughly six months. Barker's use of foreign banks in April and May 1972, to deposit checks and withdraw the funds via cashier's checks and money orders, resulted in the banks keeping the entire transaction records until October and November 1972.\n\nAll five Watergate burglars were directly or indirectly tied to the 1972 CRP, thus causing Judge Sirica to suspect a conspiracy involving higher-echelon government officials.<ref>Quote: \"There were still simply too many unanswered questions in the case. By that time, thinking about the break-in and reading about it, I'd have had to be some kind of moron to believe that no other people were involved. No political campaign committee would turn over so much money to a man like Gordon Liddy without someone higher up in the organization approving the transaction. How could I not see that?

On October 10, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein reported that the FBI had determined that the Watergate break-in was part of a massive campaign of political spying and sabotage on behalf of the Nixon re-election committee. Despite these revelations, Nixon's campaign was never seriously jeopardized; on November 7, the [[1972 United States presidential election|President was re-elected]] in one of the biggest landslides in American political history.\n\n===Role of the media===\nThe connection between the break-in and the re-election committee was highlighted by media coverage\u2014in particular, investigative coverage by ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', and ''[[The New York Times]]''. The coverage dramatically increased publicity and consequent political and legal repercussions. Relying heavily upon [[anonymous sources]], ''Post'' reporters [[Bob Woodward]] and [[Carl Bernstein]] uncovered information suggesting that knowledge of the break-in, and attempts to cover it up, led deeply into the upper reaches of the Justice Department, FBI, CIA, and the White House. Woodward and Bernstein interviewed [[Judy Hoback Miller]], the bookkeeper for Nixon's re-election campaign, who revealed to them information about the mishandling of funds and records being destroyed.<ref>[http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2012/06/woodward-and-bernstein-downplay-deep-throat-125950.html \"Woodward Downplays Deep Throat\"], Politico.com blog, June 2012.

Felt warned Woodward that the FBI wanted to know where he and other reporters were getting their information, as they were uncovering a wider web of crimes than the FBI first disclosed.

(Then-Justice [[William Rehnquist]]\u2014who had recently been appointed to the Court by Nixon and most recently served in the Nixon Justice Department as Assistant Attorney General of the Office of Legal Counsel\u2014recused himself from the case.)

In this conversation, Dean summarized many aspects of the Watergate case, and focused on the subsequent cover-up, describing it as a \"cancer on the presidency\". The burglary team was being paid [[hush money]] for their silence and Dean stated: \"That's the most troublesome post-thing, because Bob [Haldeman] is involved in that; John [Ehrlichman] is involved in that; I am involved in that; Mitchell is involved in that. And that's an obstruction of justice.\" Dean continued, saying that Howard Hunt was blackmailing the White House demanding money immediately. Nixon replied that the money should be paid: \"...&nbsp; just looking at the immediate problem, don't you have to have\u2014handle Hunt's financial situation damn soon?&nbsp;... you've got to keep the cap on the bottle that much, in order to have any options\".<ref name=\"nixonlibrary.gov\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.nixonlibrary.gov/forresearchers/find/tapes/watergate/wspf/886-008.pdf |title=Transcript Prepared by the Impeachment Inquiry Staff for the House Judiciary Committee of a Recording of a Meeting Among the President, John Dean and H.R.

We won't second-guess Mitchell and the rest.\" Returning to the use of the CIA to obstruct the FBI, he instructed Haldeman: \"You call them in. Good. Good deal. Play it tough.

Throughout the long and difficult period of Watergate, I have felt it was my duty to persevere, to make every possible effort to complete the term of office to which you elected me. In the past few days, however, it has become evident to me that I no longer have a strong enough political base in the Congress to justify continuing that effort. As long as there was such a base, I felt strongly that it was necessary to see the constitutional process through to its conclusion, that to do otherwise would be unfaithful to the spirit of that deliberately difficult process and a dangerously destabilizing precedent for the future.\n\n...&nbsp;I would have preferred to carry through to the finish whatever the personal agony it would have involved, and my family unanimously urged me to do so. But the interest of the Nation must always come before any personal considerations. From the discussions I have had with Congressional and other leaders, I have concluded that because of the Watergate matter I might not have the support of the Congress that I would consider necessary to back the very difficult decisions and carry out the duties of this office in the way the interests of the Nation would require.\n\n...&nbsp;''I have never been a quitter''. To leave office before my term is completed is abhorrent to every instinct in my body. But as President, I must put the interest of America first. America needs a full-time President and a full-time Congress, particularly at this time with problems we face at home and abroad. To continue to fight through the months ahead for my personal vindication would almost totally absorb the time and attention of both the President and the Congress in a period when our entire focus should be on the great issues of peace abroad and prosperity without inflation at home.

His options for resigning were to delay his resignation until further along in the impeachment process, to try to settle for a censure vote in Congress, or to pardon himself and then resign.

The Democrats gained five seats in the Senate and forty-nine in the House (the newcomers were nicknamed \"[[Watergate Babies]]\").

However, they are each governed by a committee of Bishops, called the Holy Synod, with one central Bishop holding the honorary title of \"first among equals\".\n\nGreek Orthodox Churches are united in [[Communion (Christian)|communion]] with each other, as well as with the other [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]es. The Orthodox hold a common [[doctrine]] and a common form of worship, and they see themselves not as separate Churches but as administrative units of one single Church. They are notable for their extensive tradition of [[Christian iconography|iconography]] (''see also: [[Byzantine art]]''), for their veneration of the [[Mother of God]] and the [[Saints]], and for their use of the [[Divine Liturgy]] on Sundays, which is a standardized worship service dating back to the fourth century A.D. in its current form. The most commonly used [[Divine Liturgy]] of the Orthodox Church was written by [[Saint John Chrysostom]] (347\u2013407 A.D.). Others are attributed to [[St. Basil the Great]], [[James, brother of Jesus|St. James, the Brother of God]] and [[Pope Gregory the Great|St. Gregory the Dialogist]].\n\nThe current territory of the Greek Orthodox Churches more or less covers the areas in the [[Balkans]], [[Anatolia]], and the [[Eastern Mediterranean]] that used to be a part of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The majority of Greek Orthodox Christians live within [[Greece]] and elsewhere in the southern [[Balkans]] including [[Albania]], but also in Jordan, the [[Palestinian territories]], Iraq, [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], [[Cyprus]], [[Anatolia]], European [[Turkey]], and the [[Caucasus Greeks|South Caucasus]]. In addition, due to the large Greek diaspora, there are many Greek Orthodox Christians who live in [[Greek Americans|North America]] and [[Greek Australians|Australia]]. Orthodox Christians in [[Finland]], who compose about 1% of the population, are also under the jurisdiction of a Greek Orthodox Church (the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Ecumenical Patriarchate]]).\n\nThere are also many Greek Orthodox Christians, with origins dating back to the [[Byzantine]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] periods, who are of [[Arabic]]-speaking or mixed Greek and Arabic-speaking ancestry and live in southern [[Turkey]], [[Israel]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Iraq]], [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], [[Jordan]], and [[Egypt]]. They attend churches which conduct their services in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], the common language of most Greek Orthodox believers in the [[Levant]], while at the same time maintaining elements of the [[Byzantine Greek]] cultural tradition.\n\nEthnic [[Greeks in Russia]] and [[Greeks in Ukraine]], as well as [[Pontic Greeks]] and [[Caucasus Greeks]] from the former Russian [[Transcaucasus]], often consider themselves both Greek Orthodox and [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]], which is consistent with the Orthodox faith (since Orthodoxy is the same across ethnic boundaries). Thus, they may attend services held in [[Old Russian]] and [[Old Church Slavonic]], without this in any way undermining their Orthodox faith or distinct Greek ethnic identity. Over the centuries, these [[Pontic Greeks|Pontic Greek]]-speaking Greek Orthodox communities have mixed through intermarriage in varying degrees with ethnic Russians and other Orthodox Christians from mainly [[Southern Russia]], where most of them settled between the [[Middle Ages]] and early 19th century.\n\n==Churches==\n[[File:AgiosAndreas.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[St Andrew's Cathedral,

However, they are each governed by a committee of Bishops, called the Holy Synod, with one central Bishop holding the honorary title of \"first among equals\".\n\nGreek Orthodox Churches are united in [[Communion (Christian)|communion]] with each other, as well as with the other [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]es. The Orthodox hold a common [[doctrine]] and a common form of worship, and they see themselves not as separate Churches but as administrative units of one single Church. They are notable for their extensive tradition of [[Christian iconography|iconography]] (''see also: [[Byzantine art]]''), for their veneration of the [[Mother of God]] and the [[Saints]], and for their use of the [[Divine Liturgy]] on Sundays, which is a standardized worship service dating back to the fourth century A.D. in its current form. The most commonly used [[Divine Liturgy]] of the Orthodox Church was written by [[Saint John Chrysostom]] (347\u2013407 A.D.). Others are attributed to [[St. Basil the Great]], [[James, brother of Jesus|St. James, the Brother of God]] and [[Pope Gregory the Great|St. Gregory the Dialogist]].\n\nThe current territory of the Greek Orthodox Churches more or less covers the areas in the [[Balkans]], [[Anatolia]], and the [[Eastern Mediterranean]] that used to be a part of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The majority of Greek Orthodox Christians live within [[Greece]] and elsewhere in the southern [[Balkans]] including [[Albania]], but also in Jordan, the [[Palestinian territories]], Iraq, [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], [[Cyprus]], [[Anatolia]], European [[Turkey]], and the [[Caucasus Greeks|South Caucasus]]. In addition, due to the large Greek diaspora, there are many Greek Orthodox Christians who live in [[Greek Americans|North America]] and [[Greek Australians|Australia]]. Orthodox Christians in [[Finland]], who compose about 1% of the population, are also under the jurisdiction of a Greek Orthodox Church (the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Ecumenical Patriarchate]]).\n\nThere are also many Greek Orthodox Christians, with origins dating back to the [[Byzantine]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] periods, who are of [[Arabic]]-speaking or mixed Greek and Arabic-speaking ancestry and live in southern [[Turkey]], [[Israel]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Iraq]], [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], [[Jordan]], and [[Egypt]]. They attend churches which conduct their services in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], the common language of most Greek Orthodox believers in the [[Levant]], while at the same time maintaining elements of the [[Byzantine Greek]] cultural tradition.\n\nEthnic [[Greeks in Russia]] and [[Greeks in Ukraine]], as well as [[Pontic Greeks]] and [[Caucasus Greeks]] from the former Russian [[Transcaucasus]], often consider themselves both Greek Orthodox and [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]], which is consistent with the Orthodox faith (since Orthodoxy is the same across ethnic boundaries). Thus, they may attend services held in [[Old Russian]] and [[Old Church Slavonic]], without this in any way undermining their Orthodox faith or distinct Greek ethnic identity. Over the centuries, these [[Pontic Greeks|Pontic Greek]]-speaking Greek Orthodox communities have mixed through intermarriage in varying degrees with ethnic Russians and other Orthodox Christians from mainly [[Southern Russia]], where most of them settled between the [[Middle Ages]] and early 19th century.\n\n==Churches==\n[[File:AgiosAndreas.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[St Andrew's Cathedral,

{"title_page": "Spectrum of a C*-algebra", "text_new": "In mathematics, the '''spectrum of a [[C*-algebra]]''' or '''dual of a C*-algebra''' ''A'', denoted ''\u00c2'', is the set of [[unitary representation|unitary equivalence]] classes of  [[irreducible representation|irreducible]] *-representations of ''A''. A [[*-representation]] \u03c0 of ''A'' on a [[Hilbert space]] ''H'' is '''irreducible''' if, and only if, there is no closed subspace ''K'' different from ''H'' and {0} which is invariant under all operators \u03c0(''x'') with ''x'' \u2208 ''A''. We implicitly assume that irreducible representation means ''non-null'' irreducible representation, thus excluding trivial (i.e. identically 0) representations on one-[[dimension]]al [[space (mathematics)|spaces]]. As explained below, the spectrum ''\u00c2'' is also naturally a [[topological space]]; this is similar to the notion of the [[spectrum of a ring]].\n\nOne of the most important applications of this concept is to provide a notion of [[duality (mathematics)|dual]] object for any [[locally compact group]].  This dual object is suitable for formulating a [[Fourier transform]] and a [[Plancherel theorem]] for [[unimodular group|unimodular]] [[separable space|separable]] locally compact groups of type I and a decomposition theorem for arbitrary representations of separable locally compact groups of type I.  The resulting duality theory for locally compact groups is however much weaker than the [[Tannaka\u2013Krein duality]] theory for [[compact topological group]]s or [[Pontryagin duality]] for locally compact ''abelian'' groups, both of which are complete invariants. That the dual is not a complete invariant is easily seen as the  dual of any finite-dimensional full matrix algebra M<sub>''n''</sub>('''C''') consists of a single point.\n\n== Primitive spectrum ==\nThe [[topology]] of ''\u00c2'' can be defined in several equivalent ways.  We first define it in terms of the '''primitive spectrum''' .\n\nThe primitive spectrum of ''A'' is the set of [[primitive ideal]]s Prim(''A'') of ''A'', where a primitive ideal is the kernel of an irreducible *-representation. The set of primitive ideals is a [[topological space]] with the '''hull-kernel topology''' (or '''Jacobson topology'''). This is defined as follows: If ''X'' is a set of primitive ideals, its '''hull-kernel closure''' is\n\n:<math> \\overline{X} = \\left \\{\\rho \\in \\operatorname{Prim}(A): \\rho \\supseteq \\bigcap_{\\pi \\in X} \\pi \\right \\}. </math>\n\nHull-kernel closure is easily shown to be an [[idempotent]] operation, that is\n\n:<math> \\overline{\\overline{X}} = \\overline{X},</math>\n\nand it can be shown to satisfy the [[Kuratowski closure axioms]]. As a consequence, it can be shown that there is a unique topology \u03c4 on Prim(''A'') such that the closure of a set ''X'' with  respect to \u03c4 is identical to the hull-kernel closure of ''X''.\n\nSince unitarily equivalent representations have the same kernel, the map \u03c0 \u21a6 ker(\u03c0) factors through a [[surjective]] map\n\n:<math> \\operatorname{k}: \\hat{A} \\to \\operatorname{Prim}(A). </math>\n\nWe use the map ''k'' to define the topology on ''\u00c2'' as follows:\n\n'''Definition'''. The open sets of ''\u00c2'' are inverse images ''k''<sup>\u22121</sup>(''U'') of open subsets ''U'' of Prim(''A''). This is indeed a topology.\n\nThe hull-kernel topology is an analogue for non-commutative rings of the [[Zariski topology]] for commutative rings.\n\nThe topology on ''\u00c2'' induced from the hull-kernel topology has other characterizations in terms of [[state (functional analysis)|state]]s of ''A''.\n\n== Examples ==\n\n=== Commutative C*-algebras ===\n[[File:3-dim commut algebra, subalgebras, ideals.svg|thumb|right|224px|3-dimensional  commutative C*-algebra and its ideals. Each of 8 ideals corresponds to a closed subset of discrete 3-points space (or to an open complement). Primitive ideals correspond to closed [[singleton (mathematics)|singletons]]. See details at the image description page.]]\n\nThe spectrum of a commutative C*-algebra ''A'' coincides with the [[Gelfand transformation|Gelfand dual]] of ''A'' (not to be confused with the [[Banach space|dual]] ''A''' of the Banach space ''A'').  In particular, suppose ''X'' is a [[compact space|compact]] [[Hausdorff space]].  Then there is a [[natural transformation|natural]] [[homeomorphism]]\n\n:<math> \\operatorname{I}: X \\cong \\operatorname{Prim}( \\operatorname{C}(X)).</math>\n\nThis mapping is defined by\n\n: <math>  \\operatorname{I}(x) = \\{f \\in \\operatorname{C}(X): f(x) = 0 \\}.</math>\n\nI(''x'') is a closed maximal ideal in C(''X'') so is in fact primitive. For details of the proof, see the Dixmier reference.  For a commutative C*-algebra,\n\n:<math> \\hat{A} \\cong \\operatorname{Prim}(A).</math>\n\n=== The C*-algebra of bounded operators ===\nLet ''H'' be a separable [[Hilbert space]]. ''L''(''H'') has two norm-closed *-ideals: ''I''<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;{0} and the ideal ''K''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''K''(''H'') of compact operators.  Thus as a set, Prim(''L''(''H'')) =&nbsp;{''I''<sub>0</sub>,&nbsp;''K''}. Now\n\n* {''K''} is a closed subset of Prim(''L''(''H'')).\n* The closure of {''I''<sub>0</sub>} is Prim(''L''(''H'')).\n\nThus Prim(''L''(''H'')) is a non-Hausdorff space.\n\nThe spectrum of ''L''(''H'') on the other hand is much larger.  There are many inequivalent irreducible representations with kernel ''K''(''H'') or with kernel&nbsp;{0}.\n\n=== Finite-dimensional C*-algebras ===\nSuppose ''A'' is a finite-dimensional C*-algebra.  It is known ''A'' is isomorphic to a finite direct sum of full matrix algebras:\n\n:<math> A \\cong \\bigoplus_{e \\in \\operatorname{min}(A)} Ae, </math>\n\nwhere min(''A'') are the minimal central projections of ''A''.  The spectrum of ''A'' is canonically isomorphic to min(''A'') with the [[discrete topology]].  For finite-dimensional C*-algebras, we also have the isomorphism\n\n:<math> \\hat{A} \\cong \\operatorname{Prim}(A).</math>\n\n== Other characterizations of the spectrum ==\nThe hull-kernel topology is easy to describe abstractly, but in practice for C*-algebras associated to [[locally compact]] [[topological group]]s, other characterizations of the topology on the spectrum in terms of positive definite functions are desirable.\n\nIn fact, the topology on ''\u00c2'' is intimately connected with the concept of [[weak containment]] of representations as is shown by the following:\n\n:'''Theorem'''. Let ''S'' be a subset of ''\u00c2''. Then the following are equivalent for an irreducible representation \u03c0;\n:# The equivalence class of \u03c0 in ''\u00c2'' is in the closure of ''S''\n:# Every state associated to \u03c0, that is one of the form\n:::<math> f_\\xi(x) = \\langle \\xi  \\mid \\pi(x) \\xi \\rangle </math>\n::with ||\u03be|| = 1, is the weak limit of states associated to representations in ''S''.\n\nThe second condition means exactly that \u03c0 is weakly contained in ''S''.\n\nThe [[GNS construction]] is a recipe for associating states of a C*-algebra ''A'' to representations of ''A''. By one of the basic theorems associated to the GNS construction, a state ''f'' is [[pure state|pure]] if and only if the associated representation \u03c0<sub>''f''</sub> is irreducible. Moreover, the mapping \u03ba : PureState(''A'') \u2192 ''\u00c2'' defined by ''f'' \u21a6 \u03c0<sub>''f''</sub> is a surjective map.\n\nFrom the previous theorem one can easily prove the following;\n\n:'''Theorem''' The mapping\n::<math> \\kappa: \\operatorname{PureState}(A) \\to \\hat{A} </math>\n:given by the GNS construction is continuous and open.\n\n=== The space Irr<sub>''n''</sub>(''A'') ===\nThere is yet another characterization of the topology on ''\u00c2'' which arises by considering the space of representations as a topological space with an appropriate pointwise convergence topology.  More precisely, let ''n'' be a cardinal number and let ''H<sub>n</sub>'' be the canonical Hilbert space of dimension ''n''.\n\nIrr<sub>''n''</sub>(''A'') is the space of irreducible *-representations of ''A'' on ''H<sub>n</sub>'' with the point-weak topology.  In terms of convergence of nets, this topology is defined by \u03c0<sub>''i''</sub> \u2192 \u03c0; if and only if\n\n:<math>\\langle \\pi_i(x) \\xi \\mid \\eta \\rangle \\to \\langle \\pi(x) \\xi \\mid \\eta \\rangle \\quad \\forall \\xi, \\eta \\in H_n \\ x \\in A. </math>\n\nIt turns out that this topology on Irr<sub>''n''</sub>(''A'') is the same as the point-strong topology, i.e. \u03c0<sub>''i''</sub> \u2192 \u03c0 if and only if\n\n:<math> \\pi_i(x) \\xi \\to \\pi(x) \\xi \\quad \\mbox{ normwise } \\forall \\xi \\in H_n \\ x \\in A. </math>\n\n:'''Theorem'''. Let ''\u00c2<sub>n</sub>'' be the subset of ''\u00c2'' consisting of equivalence classes of representations whose underlying  Hilbert space has dimension ''n''. The canonical map Irr<sub>''n''</sub>(''A'') \u2192 ''\u00c2<sub>n</sub>'' is continuous and open. In particular, ''\u00c2<sub>n</sub>'' can be regarded as the quotient topological space of Irr<sub>''n''</sub>(''A'') under unitary equivalence.\n\n'''Remark'''.  The piecing together of the various ''\u00c2<sub>n</sub>'' can be quite complicated.\n\n== Mackey\u2013Borel structure ==\n''\u00c2'' is a topological space and thus can also be regarded as a [[Borel set|Borel space]].  A famous conjecture of [[G. Mackey]] proposed that a ''separable'' locally compact group is of type I if and only if the Borel space is standard, i.e. is isomorphic (in the category of Borel spaces) to the underlying Borel space of a [[Polish space|complete separable metric space]].  Mackey called Borel spaces with this property '''smooth'''. This conjecture was proved by [[James Glimm]] for separable C*-algebras in the 1961 paper listed in the references below.\n\n'''Definition'''.  A non-degenerate *-representation \u03c0 of a separable C*-algebra ''A'' is a '''factor representation''' if and only if the center of the von Neumann algebra generated by \u03c0(''A'') is one-dimensional.  A C*-algebra ''A'' is of type I if and only if any separable factor representation of ''A'' is a finite or countable multiple of an irreducible one.\n\nExamples of separable locally compact groups ''G'' such that C*(''G'') is of type I are [[connected space|connected]] (real) [[nilpotent]] [[Lie group]]s and connected real [[semi-simple]] Lie groups.  Thus the [[Heisenberg group]]s are all of type I. Compact and abelian groups are also of type I.\n\n:'''Theorem'''. If ''A'' is separable, ''\u00c2'' is smooth if and only if ''A'' is of type I.\n\nThe result implies a far-reaching generalization of the structure of representations of separable type I C*-algebras and correspondingly of separable locally compact groups of type I.\n\n== Algebraic primitive spectra  ==\n{{see also|Primitive spectrum}}\nSince a C*-algebra ''A'' is a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]], we can also consider the set of [[primitive ideal]]s of ''A'', where ''A'' is regarded algebraically.  For a ring an ideal is primitive if and only if it is the [[Annihilator (ring theory)|annihilator]] of a [[simple module]].  It turns out that for a C*-algebra ''A'', an ideal is algebraically primitive [[if and only if]] it is primitive in the sense defined above.\n\n:'''Theorem'''.  Let ''A'' be a C*-algebra.  Any algebraically irreducible representation of ''A'' on a complex vector space is algebraically equivalent to a topologically irreducible *-representation on a Hilbert space.  Topologically irreducible *-representations on a Hilbert space are algebraically isomorphic if and only if they are unitarily equivalent.\n\nThis is the Corollary of Theorem 2.9.5 of the Dixmier reference.\n\nIf ''G'' is a locally compact group, the topology on dual space of the [[group algebra of a locally compact group|group C*-algebra]] C*(''G'') of ''G'' is called the '''Fell topology''', named after [[J. M. G. Fell]].\n\n== References ==\n* J.  Dixmier, ''Les C*-alg\u00e8bres et leurs repr\u00e9sentations'', Gauthier-Villars, 1969.\n* J.

A [[*-representation]] \u03c0 of ''A'' on a [[Hilbert space]] ''H'' is '''irreducible''' if, and only if, there is no closed subspace ''K'' different from ''H'' and {0} which is invariant under all operators \u03c0(''x'') with ''x'' \u2208 ''A''. We implicitly assume that irreducible representation means ''non-null'' irreducible representation, thus excluding trivial (i.e. identically 0) representations on one-[[dimension]]al [[space (mathematics)|spaces]]. As explained below, the spectrum ''\u00c2'' is also naturally a [[topological space]]; this is similar to the notion of the [[spectrum of a ring]].\n\nOne of the most important applications of this concept is to provide a notion of [[duality (mathematics)|dual]] object for any [[locally compact group]].  This dual object is suitable for formulating a [[Fourier transform]] and a [[Plancherel theorem]] for [[unimodular group|unimodular]] [[separable space|separable]] locally compact groups of type I and a decomposition theorem for arbitrary representations of separable locally compact groups of type I.  The resulting duality theory for locally compact groups is however much weaker than the [[Tannaka\u2013Krein duality]] theory for [[compact topological group]]s or [[Pontryagin duality]] for locally compact ''abelian'' groups, both of which are complete invariants. That the dual is not a complete invariant is easily seen as the  dual of any finite-dimensional full matrix algebra M<sub>''n''</sub>('''C''') consists of a single point.\n\n== Primitive spectrum ==\nThe [[topology]] of ''\u00c2'' can be defined in several equivalent ways.  We first define it in terms of the '''primitive spectrum''' .\n\nThe primitive spectrum of ''A'' is the set of [[primitive ideal]]s Prim(''A'') of ''A'', where a primitive ideal is the kernel of an irreducible *-representation. The set of primitive ideals is a [[topological space]] with the '''hull-kernel topology''' (or '''Jacobson topology'''). This is defined as follows: If ''X'' is a set of primitive ideals, its '''hull-kernel closure''' is\n\n:<math> \\overline{X} = \\left \\{\\rho \\in \\operatorname{Prim}(A): \\rho \\supseteq \\bigcap_{\\pi \\in X} \\pi \\right \\}. </math>\n\nHull-kernel closure is easily shown to be an [[idempotent]] operation, that is\n\n:<math> \\overline{\\overline{X}} = \\overline{X},</math>\n\nand it can be shown to satisfy the [[Kuratowski closure axioms]]. As a consequence, it can be shown that there is a unique topology \u03c4 on Prim(''A'') such that the closure of a set ''X'' with  respect to \u03c4 is identical to the hull-kernel closure of ''X''.\n\nSince unitarily equivalent representations have the same kernel, the map \u03c0 \u21a6 ker(\u03c0) factors through a [[surjective]] map\n\n:<math> \\operatorname{k}: \\hat{A} \\to \\operatorname{Prim}(A). </math>\n\nWe use the map ''k'' to define the topology on ''\u00c2'' as follows:\n\n'''Definition'''. The open sets of ''\u00c2'' are inverse images ''k''<sup>\u22121</sup>(''U'') of open subsets ''U'' of Prim(''A''). This is indeed a topology.\n\nThe hull-kernel topology is an analogue for non-commutative rings of the [[Zariski topology]] for commutative rings.\n\nThe topology on ''\u00c2'' induced from the hull-kernel topology has other characterizations in terms of [[state (functional analysis)|state]]s of ''A''.\n\n== Examples ==\n\n=== Commutative C*-algebras ===\n[[File:3-dim commut algebra, subalgebras, ideals.svg|thumb|right|224px|3-dimensional  commutative C*-algebra and its ideals. Each of 8 ideals corresponds to a closed subset of discrete 3-points space (or to an open complement). Primitive ideals correspond to closed [[singleton (mathematics)|singletons]]. See details at the image description page.]]\n\nThe spectrum of a commutative C*-algebra ''A'' coincides with the [[Gelfand transformation|Gelfand dual]] of ''A'' (not to be confused with the [[Banach space|dual]] ''A''' of the Banach space ''A'').  In particular, suppose ''X'' is a [[compact space|compact]] [[Hausdorff space]].  Then there is a [[natural transformation|natural]] [[homeomorphism]]\n\n:<math> \\operatorname{I}: X \\cong \\operatorname{Prim}( \\operatorname{C}(X)).</math>\n\nThis mapping is defined by\n\n: <math>  \\operatorname{I}(x) = \\{f \\in \\operatorname{C}(X): f(x) = 0 \\}.</math>\n\nI(''x'') is a closed maximal ideal in C(''X'') so is in fact primitive. For details of the proof, see the Dixmier reference.  For a commutative C*-algebra,\n\n:<math> \\hat{A} \\cong \\operatorname{Prim}(A).</math>\n\n=== The C*-algebra of bounded operators ===\nLet ''H'' be a separable [[Hilbert space]]. ''L''(''H'') has two norm-closed *-ideals: ''I''<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;{0} and the ideal ''K''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''K''(''H'') of compact operators.  Thus as a set, Prim(''L''(''H'')) =&nbsp;{''I''<sub>0</sub>,&nbsp;''K''}. Now\n\n* {''K''} is a closed subset of Prim(''L''(''H'')).\n* The closure of {''I''<sub>0</sub>} is Prim(''L''(''H'')).\n\nThus Prim(''L''(''H'')) is a non-Hausdorff space.\n\nThe spectrum of ''L''(''H'') on the other hand is much larger.  There are many inequivalent irreducible representations with kernel ''K''(''H'') or with kernel&nbsp;{0}.\n\n=== Finite-dimensional C*-algebras ===\nSuppose ''A'' is a finite-dimensional C*-algebra.  It is known ''A'' is isomorphic to a finite direct sum of full matrix algebras:\n\n:<math> A \\cong \\bigoplus_{e \\in \\operatorname{min}(A)} Ae, </math>\n\nwhere min(''A'') are the minimal central projections of ''A''.  The spectrum of ''A'' is canonically isomorphic to min(''A'') with the [[discrete topology]].  For finite-dimensional C*-algebras, we also have the isomorphism\n\n:<math> \\hat{A} \\cong \\operatorname{Prim}(A).</math>\n\n== Other characterizations of the spectrum ==\nThe hull-kernel topology is easy to describe abstractly, but in practice for C*-algebras associated to [[locally compact]] [[topological group]]s, other characterizations of the topology on the spectrum in terms of positive definite functions are desirable.\n\nIn fact, the topology on ''\u00c2'' is intimately connected with the concept of [[weak containment]] of representations as is shown by the following:\n\n:'''Theorem'''. Let ''S'' be a subset of ''\u00c2''. Then the following are equivalent for an irreducible representation \u03c0;\n:# The equivalence class of \u03c0 in ''\u00c2'' is in the closure of ''S''\n:# Every state associated to \u03c0, that is one of the form\n:::<math> f_\\xi(x) = \\langle \\xi  \\mid \\pi(x) \\xi \\rangle </math>\n::with ||\u03be|| = 1, is the weak limit of states associated to representations in ''S''.\n\nThe second condition means exactly that \u03c0 is weakly contained in ''S''.\n\nThe [[GNS construction]] is a recipe for associating states of a C*-algebra ''A'' to representations of ''A''. By one of the basic theorems associated to the GNS construction, a state ''f'' is [[pure state|pure]] if and only if the associated representation \u03c0<sub>''f''</sub> is irreducible. Moreover, the mapping \u03ba : PureState(''A'') \u2192 ''\u00c2'' defined by ''f'' \u21a6 \u03c0<sub>''f''</sub> is a surjective map.\n\nFrom the previous theorem one can easily prove the following;\n\n:'''Theorem''' The mapping\n::<math> \\kappa: \\operatorname{PureState}(A) \\to \\hat{A} </math>\n:given by the GNS construction is continuous and open.\n\n=== The space Irr<sub>''n''</sub>(''A'') ===\nThere is yet another characterization of the topology on ''\u00c2'' which arises by considering the space of representations as a topological space with an appropriate pointwise convergence topology.  More precisely, let ''n'' be a cardinal number and let ''H<sub>n</sub>'' be the canonical Hilbert space of dimension ''n''.\n\nIrr<sub>''n''</sub>(''A'') is the space of irreducible *-representations of ''A'' on ''H<sub>n</sub>'' with the point-weak topology.  In terms of convergence of nets, this topology is defined by \u03c0<sub>''i''</sub> \u2192 \u03c0; if and only if\n\n:<math>\\langle \\pi_i(x) \\xi \\mid \\eta \\rangle \\to \\langle \\pi(x) \\xi \\mid \\eta \\rangle \\quad \\forall \\xi, \\eta \\in H_n \\ x \\in A. </math>\n\nIt turns out that this topology on Irr<sub>''n''</sub>(''A'') is the same as the point-strong topology, i.e. \u03c0<sub>''i''</sub> \u2192 \u03c0 if and only if\n\n:<math> \\pi_i(x) \\xi \\to \\pi(x) \\xi \\quad \\mbox{ normwise } \\forall \\xi \\in H_n \\ x \\in A. </math>\n\n:'''Theorem'''. Let ''\u00c2<sub>n</sub>'' be the subset of ''\u00c2'' consisting of equivalence classes of representations whose underlying  Hilbert space has dimension ''n''. The canonical map Irr<sub>''n''</sub>(''A'') \u2192 ''\u00c2<sub>n</sub>'' is continuous and open. In particular, ''\u00c2<sub>n</sub>'' can be regarded as the quotient topological space of Irr<sub>''n''</sub>(''A'') under unitary equivalence.\n\n'''Remark'''.  The piecing together of the various ''\u00c2<sub>n</sub>'' can be quite complicated.\n\n== Mackey\u2013Borel structure ==\n''\u00c2'' is a topological space and thus can also be regarded as a [[Borel set|Borel space]].  A famous conjecture of [[G. Mackey]] proposed that a ''separable'' locally compact group is of type I if and only if the Borel space is standard, i.e. is isomorphic (in the category of Borel spaces) to the underlying Borel space of a [[Polish space|complete separable metric space]].  Mackey called Borel spaces with this property '''smooth'''. This conjecture was proved by [[James Glimm]] for separable C*-algebras in the 1961 paper listed in the references below.\n\n'''Definition'''.  A non-degenerate *-representation \u03c0 of a separable C*-algebra ''A'' is a '''factor representation''' if and only if the center of the von Neumann algebra generated by \u03c0(''A'') is one-dimensional.  A C*-algebra ''A'' is of type I if and only if any separable factor representation of ''A'' is a finite or countable multiple of an irreducible one.\n\nExamples of separable locally compact groups ''G'' such that C*(''G'') is of type I are [[connected space|connected]] (real) [[nilpotent]] [[Lie group]]s and connected real [[semi-simple]] Lie groups.  Thus the [[Heisenberg group]]s are all of type I. Compact and abelian groups are also of type I.\n\n:'''Theorem'''. If ''A'' is separable, ''\u00c2'' is smooth if and only if ''A'' is of type I.\n\nThe result implies a far-reaching generalization of the structure of representations of separable type I C*-algebras and correspondingly of separable locally compact groups of type I.\n\n== Algebraic primitive spectra  ==\n{{see also|Primitive spectrum}}\nSince a C*-algebra ''A'' is a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]], we can also consider the set of [[primitive ideal]]s of ''A'', where ''A'' is regarded algebraically.  For a ring an ideal is primitive if and only if it is the [[Annihilator (ring theory)|annihilator]] of a [[simple module]].  It turns out that for a C*-algebra ''A'', an ideal is algebraically primitive [[if and only if]] it is primitive in the sense defined above.\n\n:'''Theorem'''.  Let ''A'' be a C*-algebra.  Any algebraically irreducible representation of ''A'' on a complex vector space is algebraically equivalent to a topologically irreducible *-representation on a Hilbert space.  Topologically irreducible *-representations on a Hilbert space are algebraically isomorphic if and only if they are unitarily equivalent.\n\nThis is the Corollary of Theorem 2.9.5 of the Dixmier reference.\n\nIf ''G'' is a locally compact group, the topology on dual space of the [[group algebra|group C*-algebra]] C*(''G'') of ''G'' is called the '''Fell topology''', named after [[J. M. G. Fell]].\n\n== References ==\n* J.  Dixmier, ''Les C*-alg\u00e8bres et leurs repr\u00e9sentations'', Gauthier-Villars, 1969.\n* J.

But another version of the ''Slapat'', used by P.W. Schmidt (Schmidt 1906: 20, 101), states that it was founded on 1st waxing of [[Tabodwe|Mak (Tabodwe)]] 1116&nbsp;BE ({{circa}} 19 January 573&nbsp;CE), which it says is equivalent to year 514 of \"the third era\", without specifying what the era specifically was. However, per (Phayre 1873: 39), one of the \"native records\" used by Maj. Lloyd says that Pegu was founded in 514 [[Burmese calendar|Burmese (Myanmar) Era]] (1152/1153&nbsp;CE). <br/> If the year 514 is indeed the Burmese Era, then the ''Slapat's'' 1st waxing of Tabodwe 514 would be 27 December 1152, equivalent to 1st waxing of Tabodwe 1696&nbsp;BE (not 1116&nbsp;BE).</ref> while the ''[[Zabu Kuncha]]'', an early 15th century Burmese administrative treatise, states that Pegu was founded in 1276/77&nbsp;CE.<ref name=mat-2017-332>Aung-Thwin 2017: 332</ref> The earliest extant evidence of Pegu as a place dates only to the late [[Pagan Kingdom|Pagan period]] (1212 and 1266)<ref group=note>(Aung-Thwin 2005: 59) cites the inscription found at the Min-Nan-Thu village near [[Bagan]], which as shown in (SMK Vol. 3 1983: 28\u201331) was donated by daughter of Theingathu, dated Thursday, 7th waxing of Nanka (Wagaung) 628&nbsp;ME (8 July 1266), and lists Pegu as Pe-Ku.

After the collapse of the Pagan Empire, Bago became part of the breakaway [[Hanthawaddy Kingdom|Kingdom of Martaban]] by the 1290s.\n\nThe small settlement grew increasingly important in the 14th century as the region became most populous in the Mon-speaking kingdom. In 1369, King [[Binnya U]] made Bago the capital. The city remained the capital until the kingdom's fall in 1538.\n\nDuring the reign of King [[Razadarit]], Bago and [[Ava Kingdom]] were engaged in the [[Forty Years' War]]. The peaceful reign of Queen [[Shin Sawbu]] came to an end when she chose the Buddhist monk [[Dhammazedi]] (1471\u20131492) to succeed her. Under Dhammazedi, Bago became a centre of commerce and [[Theravada]] [[Buddhism]].\n\nIn 1519, [[Ant\u00f3nio Correia (admiral)|Ant\u00f3nio Correia]], then a merchant from the Portuguese ''casados'' settlement at [[Cochin]] landed in Bago, then known to the Portuguese as Pegu, looking for new markets for pepper from Cochin.<ref>{{cite web|author=Lu\u00eds Filipe Tom\u00e1s|url=http://actd.iict.pt/eserv/actd:SEPV096/n096.pdf|title=A viagem de Ant\u00f3nio Correia a Pegu em 1519|publisher=Junta de Investiga\u00e7\u00f5es do Ultramar, [Lisboa]|date=1976|language=portuguese|accessdate=2014-08-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Malekandathil, Pius M C|url=http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/13205/10/10_chapter%203.pdf|title=ORIGIN AND GROWTH OF LUSO-INDIAN COMMUNITY in Portuguese Cochin and the maritime trade of India, 1500-6663|publisher=Pondicherry University|date=2010-10-26|accessdate=2014-08-05}}|</ref> A year later, [[List of governors of Portuguese India|Portuguese India Governor]] [[Diogo Lopes de Sequeira]] sent an ambassador to Pegu.\n\nAs a major seaport, the city was frequently visited by Europeans, among these, [[Gasparo Balbi]] and [[Ralph Fitch]] in the late 1500s. The Europeans often commented on its magnificence.\n[[File:The king of PEgu recievs an envoy (17th century).jpg|left|thumb|278x278px|The king of Pegu receives an envoy (17th century)]]\nThe Portuguese conquest of Pegu, following the destruction caused by the kings of Tangot and Arrakan in 1599, was described by Manuel de Abreu Mousinho in \"Breve discurso em que se conta a conquista do Reino do Peg\u00fa na India oriental feita pelos portugueses em tempo do vice-rei Aires de Saldanha, sendo capit\u00e3o Salvador Ribeiro de Sousa, chamado Massinga, natural de Guimar\u00e3es, a quem os naturais do Peg\u00fa elegeram por seu rei no ano de 1600\" (Brief narrative telling the conquest of Pegu in eastern India made by the Portuguese in the time of the viceroy Aires de Saldanha, being captain Salvador Ribeiro de Sousa, called Massinga, born in Guimar\u00e3es, elected as their king by the natives in the year 1600), published from 1711 to 1829 with \"Peregrina\u00e7am\" of Fern\u00e3o Mendes Pinto.\n\nThe capital was looted by the viceroy of [[Toungoo]], [[Minye Thihathu II of Toungoo]], and then burned by the viceroy of [[Rakhine State|Arakin]] during the [[Burmese\u2013Siamese War (1594\u20131605)]]. [[Anaukpetlun]] wanted to rebuild Hongsawadi, which had been deserted since [[Nanda Bayin]] had abandoned it.

However, a [[Bamar people|Bamar]] king, [[Alaungpaya]], captured the city in May 1757.\n\nBago was rebuilt by King [[Bodawpaya]] (r.&nbsp;1782-1819), but by then the river had shifted course, cutting the city off from the sea. It never regained its previous importance. After the [[Second Anglo-Burmese War]], the [[British Empire|British]] annexed Bago in 1852. In 1862, the province of [[British rule in Burma|British Burma]] was formed, and the capital moved to [[Yangon]]. The substantial differences between the colloquial and literary pronunciations, as with Burmese words, was a reason of the British corruption \"Pegu\".\n\nIn 1911, Hanthawaddy was described as a district in the [[Bago Region|Bago]] (or ''Pegu'') division of [[Lower Burma]]. It lay in the home district of [[Yangon]], from which the town was detached to make a separate district in 1880. It had an area of {{convert|3023|sqmi|km2}}, with a population of 48,411 in 1901, showing an increase of 22% in the past decade. Hanthawaddy and [[Hinthada]] were the two most densely populated districts in the province.\n\nHanthawaddy, as it was constituted in 1911, consisted of a vast plain stretching up from the sea between the mouth of the [[Irrawaddy River]] and the [[Pegu Range]]. Except the tract of land lying between the Pegu Range on the east and the [[Yangon River]], the country was intersected by numerous [[Creek (tidal)|tidal creek]]s, many of which were navigable by large boats and some by steamers. The headquarters of the district was in Rangoon, which was also the sub-divisional headquarters. The second sub-division had its headquarters at [[Insein Township|Insein]], where there were large railway works. Cultivation was almost wholly confined to rice, but there were many vegetable and fruit gardens.\n\nToday, Hanthawaddy is one of the wards of Bago city.\n\n==Climate==\n{{Weather box\n| location = Bago, Myanmar (1981\u20132010)\n| single line  = Y\n| metric first = Y\n| Jan high C = 31.6\n| Feb high C = 34.0\n| Mar high C = 36.2\n| Apr high C = 38.1\n| May high C = 34.3\n| Jun high C = 30.1\n| Jul high C = 29.7\n| Aug high C = 29.6\n| Sep high C = 30.8\n| Oct high C = 30.7\n| Nov high C = 32.2\n| Dec high C = 31.0\n| year high C = 32.4\n| Jan low C = 15.8\n| Feb low C = 17.2\n| Mar low C = 20.2\n| Apr low C = 23.1\n| May low C = 23.4\n| Jun low C = 22.7\n| Jul low C = 22.7\n| Aug low C = 22.6\n| Sep low C = 22.8\n| Oct low C = 23.0\n| Nov low C = 20.9\n| Dec low C = 16.9\n| year low C = 20.9\n| rain colour = green\n| Jan rain mm = 1.3\n| Feb rain mm = 2.7\n| Mar rain mm = 13.5\n| Apr rain mm = 44.1\n| May rain mm = 333.9\n| Jun rain mm = 654.0\n| Jul rain mm = 716.9\n| Aug rain mm = 653.4\n| Sep rain mm = 436.3\n| Oct rain mm = 183.7\n| Nov rain mm = 48.7\n| Dec rain mm = 1.3\n| year rain mm = 3089.8\n| source 1 = [[Norwegian Meteorological Institute]]<ref name=\"metno\">{{cite web | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20181008145507/http://met-xpprod.customer.enonic.io/publikasjoner/met-report/met-report-2017/_/attachment/download/a3bf1468-4e93-486a-aa3f-4bea3871cffa:b8f39ba9ecfbde7d7c6da8ca769f4a1a96d61d39/MyanmarClimateReportFINAL24Oct2017.pdf | archivedate = 8 October 2018 | url = http://met-xpprod.customer.enonic.io/publikasjoner/met-report/met-report-2017/_/attachment/download/a3bf1468-4e93-486a-aa3f-4bea3871cffa:b8f39ba9ecfbde7d7c6da8ca769f4a1a96d61d39/MyanmarClimateReportFINAL24Oct2017.pdf | title = Myanmar Climate Report | publisher = Norwegian Meteorological Institute | pages =23-36  | accessdate = 30 November 2018}}</ref> \n}}\n\n==Places of interest==\n[[Image:Bago-Blick von Mahazedi Paya.JPG|thumb|right|View from Mahazedi Pagoda]]\n* [[Shwethalyaung Buddha]] ([[Reclining Buddha]])\n* [[Shwemawdaw Pagoda]]\n* [[Kyaikpun Buddha]]\n* [[Kanbawzathadi Palace]] site and museum\n* [[Kalyani Ordination Hall]]\n* [[Mahazedi Pagoda]]\n* Shwegugyi Pagoda\n* [[Shwegugale Pagoda]]\n* [[Bago Sittaung Canal]]\n\n==Sports==\n* Grand Royal Stadium\n\n==Health care==\n* Bago General Hospital (500-bedded Public Hospital)\n* Bago Traditional Medicine Hospital\n\n==Education==\n* [[Bago University]]\n* [[Basic Education High School No. 1 Bago]]\n*[[Basic Education High School No. 3 Bago]] \n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book | last=Aung-Thwin | first=Michael A. | title=The Mists of R\u0101ma\u00f1\u00f1a: The Legend that was Lower Burma | edition=illustrated | publisher=University of Hawai'i Press | year=2005 | location=Honolulu | isbn=9780824828868}}\n* {{cite book | last=Aung-Thwin | first=Michael A. | title=Myanmar in the Fifteenth Century | publisher=University of Hawai'i Press | year=2017 | location=Honolulu | isbn=978-0-8248-6783-6}}\n* {{cite book | editor=Nyein Maung | title=Shay-haung Myanma Kyauksa-mya [Ancient Burmese Stone Inscriptions] | volume=1\u20135 | language=Burmese | location=Yangon | publisher=Archaeological Department | year=1972\u20131998}}\n* {{cite book | last=Pan Hla | first=Nai | title=[[Razadarit Ayedawbon]] | language=Burmese | year=1968 | edition=8th printing, 2005 | location=Yangon | publisher=Armanthit Sarpay}}\n* {{cite journal | last=[[Arthur Purves Phayre|Phayre]] | first=Major-General Sir Arthur P. | title=The History of Pegu | work=Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal | volume=42 | year=1873 | location=Calcutta | pages=23\u201357, 120\u2013159 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CboIAAAAQAAJ }}\n* {{cite book | last=[[Arthur Purves Phayre|Phayre]] | first=Lt.

But another version of the ''Slapat'', used by P.W. Schmidt (Schmidt 1906: 20, 101), states that it was founded on 1st waxing of [[Tabodwe|Mak (Tabodwe)]] 1116 BE ({{circa}} 19 January 573 CE), which it says is equivalent to year 514 of \"the third era\", without specifying what the era specifically was. However, per (Phayre 1873: 39), one of the \"native records\" used by Maj. Lloyd says that Pegu was founded in 514 [[Burmese calendar|Burmese (Myanmar) Era]] (1152/1153 CE). <br/> If the year 514 is indeed the Burmese Era, then the ''Slapat's'' 1st waxing of Tabodwe 514 would be 27 December 1152, equivalent to 1st waxing of Tabodwe 1696 BE (not 1116 BE).</ref> while the ''[[Zabu Kuncha]]'', an early 15th century Burmese administrative treatise, states that Pegu was founded in 1276/77 CE.<ref name=mat-2017-332>Aung-Thwin 2017: 332</ref> The earliest extant evidence of Pegu as a place dates only to the late [[Pagan Kingdom|Pagan period]] (1212 and 1266)<ref group=note>(Aung-Thwin 2005: 59) cites the inscription found at the Min-Nan-Thu village near [[Bagan]], which as shown in (SMK Vol. 3 1983: 28\u201331) was donated by daughter of Theingathu, dated Thursday, 7th waxing of Nanka (Wagaung) 628 ME (8 July 1266), and lists Pegu as Pe-Ku.

After the collapse of the Pagan Empire, Bago became part of the breakaway [[Hanthawaddy Kingdom|Kingdom of Martaban]] by the 1290s.\n\nThe small settlement grew increasingly important in the 14th century as the region became most populous in the Mon-speaking kingdom. In 1369, King [[Binnya U]] made Bago the capital. The city remained the capital until the kingdom's fall in 1538.\n\nDuring the reign of King [[Razadarit]], Bago and [[Ava Kingdom]] were engaged in the [[Forty Years' War]]. The peaceful reign of Queen [[Shin Sawbu]] came to an end when she chose the Buddhist monk [[Dhammazedi]] (1471\u20131492) to succeed her. Under Dhammazedi, Bago became a centre of commerce and [[Theravada]] [[Buddhism]].\n\nIn 1519, [[Ant\u00f3nio Correia (admiral)|Ant\u00f3nio Correia]], then a merchant from the Portuguese ''casados'' settlement at [[Cochin]] landed in Bago, then known to the Portuguese as Pegu, looking for new markets for pepper from Cochin.<ref>{{cite web|author=Lu\u00eds Filipe Tom\u00e1s|url=http://actd.iict.pt/eserv/actd:SEPV096/n096.pdf|title=A viagem de Ant\u00f3nio Correia a Pegu em 1519|publisher=Junta de Investiga\u00e7\u00f5es do Ultramar, [Lisboa]|date=1976|language=portuguese|accessdate=2014-08-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Malekandathil, Pius M C|url=http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/13205/10/10_chapter%203.pdf|title=ORIGIN AND GROWTH OF LUSO-INDIAN COMMUNITY in Portuguese Cochin and the maritime trade of India, 1500-6663|publisher=Pondicherry University|date=2010-10-26|accessdate=2014-08-05}}|</ref> A year later, [[List of governors of Portuguese India|Portuguese India Governor]] [[Diogo Lopes de Sequeira]] sent an ambassador to Pegu.\n\nAs a major seaport, the city was frequently visited by Europeans, among these, [[Gasparo Balbi]] and [[Ralph Fitch]] in the late 1500s. The Europeans often commented on its magnificence.\n[[File:The king of PEgu recievs an envoy (17th century).jpg|left|thumb|278x278px|The king of Pegu receives an envoy (17th century)]]\nThe Portuguese conquest of Pegu, following the destruction caused by the kings of Tangot and Arrakan in 1599, was described by Manuel de Abreu Mousinho in \"Breve discurso em que se conta a conquista do Reino do Peg\u00fa na India oriental feita pelos portugueses em tempo do vice-rei Aires de Saldanha, sendo capit\u00e3o Salvador Ribeiro de Sousa, chamado Massinga, natural de Guimar\u00e3es, a quem os naturais do Peg\u00fa elegeram por seu rei no ano de 1600\" (Brief narrative telling the conquest of Pegu in eastern India made by the Portuguese in the time of the viceroy Aires de Saldanha, being captain Salvador Ribeiro de Sousa, called Massinga, born in Guimar\u00e3es, elected as their king by the natives in the year 1600), published from 1711 to 1829 with \"Peregrina\u00e7am\" of Fern\u00e3o Mendes Pinto.\n\nThe capital was looted by the viceroy of [[Toungoo]], [[Minye Thihathu II of Toungoo]], and then burned by the viceroy of [[Rakhine State|Arakin]] during the [[Burmese\u2013Siamese War (1594\u20131605)]].

However, a [[Bamar people|Bamar]] king, [[Alaungpaya]], captured the city in May 1757.\n\nBago was rebuilt by King [[Bodawpaya]] (r. 1782-1819), but by then the river had shifted course, cutting the city off from the sea. It never regained its previous importance. After the [[Second Anglo-Burmese War]], the [[British Empire|British]] annexed Bago in 1852. In 1862, the province of [[British rule in Burma|British Burma]] was formed, and the capital moved to [[Yangon]]. The substantial differences between the colloquial and literary pronunciations, as with Burmese words, was a reason of the British corruption \"Pegu\".\n\nIn 1911, Hanthawaddy was described as a district in the [[Bago Region|Bago]] (or ''Pegu'') division of [[Lower Burma]]. It lay in the home district of [[Yangon]], from which the town was detached to make a separate district in 1880. It had an area of {{convert|3023|sqmi|km2}}, with a population of 48,411 in 1901, showing an increase of 22% in the past decade. Hanthawaddy and [[Hinthada]] were the two most densely populated districts in the province.\n\nHanthawaddy, as it was constituted in 1911, consisted of a vast plain stretching up from the sea between the mouth of the [[Irrawaddy River]] and the [[Pegu Range]]. Except the tract of land lying between the Pegu Range on the east and the [[Yangon River]], the country was intersected by numerous [[Creek (tidal)|tidal creek]]s, many of which were navigable by large boats and some by steamers. The headquarters of the district was in Rangoon, which was also the sub-divisional headquarters. The second sub-division had its headquarters at [[Insein Township|Insein]], where there were large railway works. Cultivation was almost wholly confined to rice, but there were many vegetable and fruit gardens.\n\nToday, Hanthawaddy is one of the wards of Bago city.\n\n==Climate==\n{{Weather box\n| location = Bago, Myanmar (1981\u20132010)\n| single line  = Y\n| metric first = Y\n| Jan high C = 31.6\n| Feb high C = 34.0\n| Mar high C = 36.2\n| Apr high C = 38.1\n| May high C = 34.3\n| Jun high C = 30.1\n| Jul high C = 29.7\n| Aug high C = 29.6\n| Sep high C = 30.8\n| Oct high C = 30.7\n| Nov high C = 32.2\n| Dec high C = 31.0\n| year high C = 32.4\n| Jan low C = 15.8\n| Feb low C = 17.2\n| Mar low C = 20.2\n| Apr low C = 23.1\n| May low C = 23.4\n| Jun low C = 22.7\n| Jul low C = 22.7\n| Aug low C = 22.6\n| Sep low C = 22.8\n| Oct low C = 23.0\n| Nov low C = 20.9\n| Dec low C = 16.9\n| year low C = 20.9\n| rain colour = green\n| Jan rain mm = 1.3\n| Feb rain mm = 2.7\n| Mar rain mm = 13.5\n| Apr rain mm = 44.1\n| May rain mm = 333.9\n| Jun rain mm = 654.0\n| Jul rain mm = 716.9\n| Aug rain mm = 653.4\n| Sep rain mm = 436.3\n| Oct rain mm = 183.7\n| Nov rain mm = 48.7\n| Dec rain mm = 1.3\n| year rain mm = 3089.8\n| source 1 = [[Norwegian Meteorological Institute]]<ref name=\"metno\">{{cite web | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20181008145507/http://met-xpprod.customer.enonic.io/publikasjoner/met-report/met-report-2017/_/attachment/download/a3bf1468-4e93-486a-aa3f-4bea3871cffa:b8f39ba9ecfbde7d7c6da8ca769f4a1a96d61d39/MyanmarClimateReportFINAL24Oct2017.pdf | archivedate = 8 October 2018 | url = http://met-xpprod.customer.enonic.io/publikasjoner/met-report/met-report-2017/_/attachment/download/a3bf1468-4e93-486a-aa3f-4bea3871cffa:b8f39ba9ecfbde7d7c6da8ca769f4a1a96d61d39/MyanmarClimateReportFINAL24Oct2017.pdf | title = Myanmar Climate Report | publisher = Norwegian Meteorological Institute | pages =23-36  | accessdate = 30 November 2018}}</ref> \n}}\n\n==Places of interest==\n[[Image:Bago-Blick von Mahazedi Paya.JPG|thumb|right|View from Mahazedi Pagoda]]\n* [[Shwethalyaung Buddha]] ([[Reclining Buddha]])\n* [[Shwemawdaw Pagoda]]\n* [[Kyaikpun Buddha]]\n* [[Kanbawzathadi Palace]] site and museum\n* [[Kalyani Ordination Hall]]\n* [[Mahazedi Pagoda]]\n* Shwegugyi Pagoda\n* [[Shwegugale Pagoda]]\n* [[Bago Sittaung Canal]]\n\n==Sports==\n* Grand Royal Stadium\n\n==Health care==\n* Bago General Hospital (500-bedded Public Hospital)\n* Bago Traditional Medicine Hospital\n\n==Education==\n* [[Bago University]]\n* [[Basic Education High School No. 1 Bago]]\n*[[Basic Education High School No. 3 Bago]] \n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book | last=Aung-Thwin | first=Michael A. | title=The Mists of R\u0101ma\u00f1\u00f1a: The Legend that was Lower Burma | edition=illustrated | publisher=University of Hawai'i Press | year=2005 | location=Honolulu | isbn=9780824828868}}\n* {{cite book | last=Aung-Thwin | first=Michael A. | title=Myanmar in the Fifteenth Century | publisher=University of Hawai'i Press | year=2017 | location=Honolulu | isbn=978-0-8248-6783-6}}\n* {{cite book | editor=Nyein Maung | title=Shay-haung Myanma Kyauksa-mya [Ancient Burmese Stone Inscriptions] | volume=1\u20135 | language=Burmese | location=Yangon | publisher=Archaeological Department | year=1972\u20131998}}\n* {{cite book | last=Pan Hla | first=Nai | title=[[Razadarit Ayedawbon]] | language=Burmese | year=1968 | edition=8th printing, 2005 | location=Yangon | publisher=Armanthit Sarpay}}\n* {{cite journal | last=[[Arthur Purves Phayre|Phayre]] | first=Major-General Sir Arthur P. | title=The History of Pegu | work=Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal | volume=42 | year=1873 | location=Calcutta | pages=23\u201357, 120\u2013159 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CboIAAAAQAAJ }}\n* {{cite book | last=[[Arthur Purves Phayre|Phayre]] | first=Lt.

Constantly bullied and harassed every day, he often reacts rashly to his mother and asks for a school transfer. Resolving to run away from his current problems and to start fresh, he moves to Seoul and goes to his new high school. However, the night before he goes to school, he obtains a new body which is tall, muscular, and very handsome.\n\nNow being able to see the world through a completely different view, he experiences the world as someone who everyone envies. Despite this, his days are always split between the two bodies, resolving to use his handsome body for the daytime and the other for the night. As Daniel lives his life with his two bodies, he begins to see just how much the world discriminates against people simply for being \"different.\" Hence the titular name of \"Lookism.\"\n\nThrough his original body, he experiences the world's discrimination and hate, while also seeing the beauty of the world through the other. His new body takes him through numerous life experiences from becoming a miniature celebrity, a trainee for an entertainment company, living through the underworld of Seoul, and modeling for clothes. Once the day turns to night, however, this rosy dream turns back into a harsh reality of what the world really is, all the discrimination coming back to haunt Daniel once more.\n\n===Arcs and side stories===\nThe arcs were put into the main story. The arcs are in no particular order:\n* Vasco's Youth - Jace tells Daniel about Vasco when he was young. They were bullied by their classmates, which culminated to Vasco getting doodles etched into his skin by a sadistic bully. A bullied victim paid Joon Goo to deal with the bullies. They went on to get tattoos to cover Vasco's scars.\n* Zack, Mira, and Johan Arc - Side story in which Zack, Mira, and Johan's story.

Instead WCW chose to have the match with WAR's Koki Kitahara, Masao Orihara, and Nobukazu Hirai vs. NJPW's Akira Nogami, Takayuki Iizuka, and El Samurai.\n\nThe WCW/NJPW Supershows were a part of a small group of WCW produced PPVs that were not included in the \"on demand\" features when the [[WWE Network]] was launched in 2014.<ref name=NowonNetwork>{{cite web | url=http://whatculture.com/wwe/16-ppvs-not-on-the-wwe-network.php/ | title=16 PPVs now on the WWE Network | accessdate=May 30, 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140723082829/http://whatculture.com/wwe/16-ppvs-not-on-the-wwe-network | archive-date=July 23, 2014 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Storylines==\nThe event featured ten [[Mock combat|professional wrestling matches]] and two pre-show matches that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and [[Narrative thread|storylines]].
