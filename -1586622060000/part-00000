Originating as [[snowmelt]] in the [[San Juan Mountains]] (part of the [[Rocky Mountains]]) of Colorado, it flows {{convert|383|mi|km}}<ref name=NHD>U.S. Geological Survey. National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. [http://viewer.nationalmap.gov/viewer/ The National Map], accessed March 21, 2011</ref> through the deserts of northern New Mexico and southeastern Utah to join the Colorado River at [[Glen Canyon]]. The river drains a high, arid region of the [[Colorado Plateau]] and along its length it is often the only significant source of fresh water for many miles. The San Juan is also one of the muddiest rivers in North America, carrying an average of 25 million US tons (22.6 million t) of silt and sediment each year.<ref name=\"Thompson\"/>\n\nHistorically, the San Juan formed the border between the territory of the [[Navajo people|Navajo]] in the south and the [[Ute people|Ute]] in the north. \n\nAlthough Europeans explored the Four Corners region at least as early as the 1700s, it was not until the gold and silver booms of the 1860s when settlers arrived in large numbers from the eastern United States. After heated conflicts over land, the Native Americans were forced into reservations, where their descendants live today. During the 20th century, intensive drilling in the fossil fuel-rich [[San Juan Basin]] and [[uranium]] mining along the lower river in Utah generated serious concerns about water quality, particularly on the [[Navajo Nation]] where the river is a crucial source of water for [[irrigation]]. Runoff from abandoned gold and silver mines is also a major issue, as occurred in the  [[2015 Gold King Mine waste water spill]] into the [[Animas River]], the main tributary of the San Juan.\n\nThe U.S. federal government has built a number of large dams in the San Juan River system to control floods, and provide irrigation and domestic water supply. In addition, the lower part of the river is inundated by [[Lake Powell]], one of the largest reservoirs in the United States. Efficient management is crucial to ensuring enough water supply for not just farms and urban areas, but also recreational boating, fisheries, and environmental restoration. However, heavy water use has significantly reduced the flow of the San Juan River, by as much as 25&nbsp;percent since pre-development conditions; in addition, warming temperatures in the Rocky Mountains are projected to have a further negative effect on snowpack, and stream flow.\n\n==Course==\n\n[[File:Wolf_Creek_Pass_View_on_West_towards_West_by_Erik_Voss_IMG_4012.JPG|thumb|left|Alpine scenery at West Fork of the San Juan River, at [[Wolf Creek Pass]], Colorado]]\n[[File:San Juan River at Pagosa Springs with balloons.jpg|thumb|left|San Juan River at [[Pagosa Springs, Colorado]], with hot-air balloons]]\n\nThe San Juan River begins in [[Archuleta County, Colorado]] at the confluence of its East and West Forks. Both forks originate above elevations of {{convert|10000|ft|m}} in the eastern San Juan Mountains in the [[San Juan National Forest]]. The river flows southwest through the foothills of the Rocky Mountains through the town of [[Pagosa Springs, Colorado|Pagosa Springs]] and reaches the [[Navajo Lake]] reservoir just north of the New Mexico border, near [[Arboles, Colorado]]. Below the [[Navajo Dam]] the San Juan River flows west through a narrow farming valley in high desert country of the Colorado Plateau. At [[Farmington, New Mexico]], it is joined from the north by its main tributary, the [[Animas River]], which rises in the San Juan Mountains near [[Silverton, Colorado]].<ref name=\"ACME\">{{cite map\n|publisher=ACME Mapper\n|title=USGS Topo Maps for United States\n|year=\n|cartography=[[United States Geological Survey]]\n|accessdate=2017-05-15\n|url=http://mapper.acme.com/}}</ref>\n\nFrom there it flows west through the [[Navajo Nation]], turning northwest near [[Shiprock, New Mexico|Shiprock]] and [[Shiprock|its namesake monolith]], crossing very briefly back into southwest Colorado (within half a mile (0.8&nbsp;km) of the [[Four Corners Monument|Four Corners]] [[quadripoint]]) before entering southeastern Utah.<ref name=\"San Juan watershed New Mexico\">{{cite web|url=https://www.env.nm.gov/swqb/SanJuan/description.html|title=A Description of the San Juan Watershed|publisher=New Mexico Environment Department|date=|accessdate=2017-05-15}}</ref> West of [[Bluff, Utah]] the river slices through the [[Comb Ridge]] and enters a series of rugged winding canyons, often over {{convert|1500|ft|m}} in depth. The lower {{convert|70|mi|km}} of the San Juan River, in a remote portion of the [[Glen Canyon National Recreation Area]], are flooded by [[Lake Powell]], which is formed by [[Glen Canyon Dam]] on the Colorado River.

In addition to the Animas River, several major tributaries join below Farmington including the [[La Plata River (San Juan River)|La Plata River]] and [[Mancos River]] in New Mexico, and [[McElmo Creek]] in Utah.<ref name=\"ACME\"/><ref name=\"SJRIP\"/> The San Juan also has a number of seasonal tributaries that drain arid regions of the Colorado Plateau. These include the Ca\u00f1on Largo and [[Chaco River]] in New Mexico, and the [[Montezuma Creek (Utah)|Montezuma Creek]] and [[Chinle Creek]] in Utah.

the chief drainage for the [[Four Corners]] region of [[Colorado]], [[New Mexico]], [[Utah]] and [[Arizona]]. Originating as [[snowmelt]] in the [[San Juan Mountains]] (part of the [[Rocky Mountains]]) of Colorado, it flows {{convert|383|mi|km}}<ref name=NHD>U.S. Geological Survey. National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. [http://viewer.nationalmap.gov/viewer/ The National Map], accessed March 21, 2011</ref> through the deserts of northern New Mexico and southeastern Utah to join the Colorado River at [[Glen Canyon]]. The river drains a high, arid region of the [[Colorado Plateau]] and along its length it is often the only significant source of fresh water for many miles. The San Juan is also one of the muddiest rivers in North America, carrying an average of 25 million US tons (22.6 million t) of silt and sediment each year.<ref name=\"Thompson\"/>\n\nHistorically, the San Juan formed the border between the territory of the [[Navajo people|Navajo]] in the south and the [[Ute people|Ute]] in the north. \n\nAlthough Europeans explored the Four Corners region at least as early as the 1700s, it was not until the gold and silver booms of the 1860s when settlers arrived in large numbers from the eastern United States. After heated conflicts over land, the Native Americans were forced into reservations, where their descendants live today. During the 20th century, intensive drilling in the fossil fuel-rich [[San Juan Basin]] and [[uranium]] mining along the lower river in Utah generated serious concerns about water quality, particularly on the [[Navajo Nation]] where the river is a crucial source of water for [[irrigation]]. Runoff from abandoned gold and silver mines is also a major issue, as occurred in the  [[2015 Gold King Mine waste water spill]] into the [[Animas River]], the main tributary of the San Juan.\n\nThe U.S. federal government has built a number of large dams in the San Juan River system to control floods, and provide irrigation and domestic water supply. In addition, the lower part of the river is inundated by [[Lake Powell]], one of the largest reservoirs in the United States. Efficient management is crucial to ensuring enough water supply for not just farms and urban areas, but also recreational boating, fisheries, and environmental restoration. However, heavy water use has significantly reduced the flow of the San Juan River, by as much as 25&nbsp;percent since pre-development conditions; in addition, warming temperatures in the Rocky Mountains are projected to have a further negative effect on snowpack, and stream flow.\n\n==Course==\n\n[[File:Wolf_Creek_Pass_View_on_West_towards_West_by_Erik_Voss_IMG_4012.JPG|thumb|left|Alpine scenery at West Fork of the San Juan River, at [[Wolf Creek Pass]], Colorado]]\n[[File:San Juan River at Pagosa Springs with balloons.jpg|thumb|left|San Juan River at [[Pagosa Springs, Colorado]], with hot-air balloons]]\n\nThe San Juan River begins in [[Archuleta County, Colorado]] at the confluence of its East and West Forks. Both forks originate above elevations of {{convert|10000|ft|m}} in the eastern San Juan Mountains in the [[San Juan National Forest]]. The river flows southwest through the foothills of the Rocky Mountains through the town of [[Pagosa Springs, Colorado|Pagosa Springs]] and reaches the [[Navajo Lake]] reservoir just north of the New Mexico border, near [[Arboles, Colorado]]. Below the [[Navajo Dam]] the San Juan River flows west through a narrow farming valley in high desert country of the Colorado Plateau. At [[Farmington, New Mexico]], it is joined from the north by its main tributary, the [[Animas River]], which rises in the San Juan Mountains near [[Silverton, Colorado]].<ref name=\"ACME\">{{cite map\n|publisher=ACME Mapper\n|title=USGS Topo Maps for United States\n|year=\n|cartography=[[United States Geological Survey]]\n|accessdate=2017-05-15\n|url=http://mapper.acme.com/}}</ref>\n\nFrom there it flows west through the [[Navajo Nation]], turning northwest near [[Shiprock, New Mexico|Shiprock]] and [[Shiprock|its namesake monolith]], crossing very briefly back into southwest Colorado (within half a mile (0.8&nbsp;km) of the [[Four Corners Monument|Four Corners]] [[quadripoint]]) before entering southeastern Utah.<ref name=\"San Juan watershed New Mexico\">{{cite web|url=https://www.env.nm.gov/swqb/SanJuan/description.html|title=A Description of the San Juan Watershed|publisher=New Mexico Environment Department|date=|accessdate=2017-05-15}}</ref> West of [[Bluff, Utah]] the river slices through the [[Comb Ridge]] and enters a series of rugged winding canyons, often over {{convert|1500|ft|m}} in depth.

She based this on the reported symptoms in those dying from the flu, as reported in the [[post mortem]] reports still available, and also the timing of the big \"death spike\" in October 1918. This occurred shortly after the [[Surgeon General of the United States Army|Surgeon General of the U.S. Army]] and the ''[[JAMA (journal)|Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' both recommended very large doses of 8 to 31&nbsp;grams of [[aspirin]] per day as part of treatment. These levels will produce [[hyperventilation]] in 33% of patients, as well as [[lung edema]] in 3% of patients.{{sfn|Starko|2009}}\n\nStarko also notes that many early deaths showed \"wet\", sometimes hemorrhagic lungs, whereas late deaths showed bacterial pneumonia. She suggests that the wave of aspirin poisonings was due to a \"[[perfect storm]]\" of events: [[Bayer]]'s patent on aspirin expired, so many companies rushed in to make a profit and greatly increased the supply; this coincided with the Spanish flu; and the symptoms of aspirin poisoning were not known at the time.{{sfn|Starko|2009}}\n\n[[File:165-WW-269B-11-trolley-l.jpg|thumb|upright|A street car conductor in [[Seattle]] in 1918 refusing to allow passengers aboard who are not wearing masks]]\nAs an explanation for the universally high mortality rate, this hypothesis was questioned in a letter to the journal published in April 2010 by Andrew Noymer and Daisy Carreon of the [[University of California, Irvine]], and Niall Johnson of the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care. They questioned the universal applicability of the aspirin theory, given the high mortality rate in countries such as India, where there was little or no access to aspirin at the time, compared to the death rate in places where aspirin was plentiful.{{sfn|Noymer|Carreon|Johnson|2010}}\n\nThey concluded that \"the [[Salicylic acid|salicylate]] [aspirin] poisoning hypothesis [was] difficult to sustain as the primary explanation for the unusual virulence of the 1918\u20131919 influenza pandemic\".{{sfn|Noymer|Carreon|Johnson|2010}} In response, Starko said there was [[anecdotal evidence]] of aspirin use in India and argued that even if aspirin over-prescription had not contributed to the high Indian mortality rate, it could still have been a factor for high rates in areas where other exacerbating factors present in India played less of a role.{{sfn|Starko|2010}}\n\n=== End of the pandemic ===\nAfter the lethal second wave struck in late 1918, new cases dropped abruptly&nbsp;\u2013 almost to nothing after the peak in the second wave.{{sfn|Barry| 2004 }} In Philadelphia, for example, 4,597&nbsp;people died in the week ending 16&nbsp;October, but by 11&nbsp;November, influenza had almost disappeared from the city. One explanation for the rapid decline in the lethality of the disease is that doctors became more effective in prevention and treatment of the pneumonia that developed after the victims had contracted the virus. However, John Barry stated in his 2004 book ''[[The Great Influenza: The Epic Story of the Deadliest Plague In History]]'' that researchers have found no evidence to support this position.{{sfn|Barry|2004b}} Some fatal cases did continue into March 1919, killing one player in the [[1919 Stanley Cup Finals]].\n\nAnother theory holds that the 1918 virus mutated extremely rapidly to a less lethal strain. This is a common occurrence with influenza viruses: there is a tendency for pathogenic viruses to become less lethal with time, as the hosts of more dangerous strains tend to die out{{sfn|Barry|2004b}} (see also [[Spanish flu#Deadly second wave|\"Deadly Second Wave\"]], above).\n\n=== Long-term effects ===\nA 2006 study in the ''Journal of Political Economy'' found that \"cohorts ''in utero'' during the pandemic displayed reduced educational attainment, increased rates of physical disability, lower income, lower socioeconomic status, and higher [[transfer payments]] received compared with other birth cohorts.\"<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Almond |first=Douglas |date=1 August 2006 |title=Is the 1918 Influenza Pandemic Over?

The rapid pace of the pandemic, which, for example, killed most of its victims in the United States within less than nine months, resulted in limited media coverage. The general population was familiar with patterns of pandemic disease in the late 19th and early 20th centuries: typhoid, [[yellow fever]], [[diphtheria]] and cholera all occurred near the same time. These outbreaks probably lessened the significance of the influenza pandemic for the public.{{sfn|Morrisey|1986|p=}} In some areas, the flu was not reported on, the only mention being that of advertisements for medicines claiming to cure it.{{sfn|Benedict|Braithwaite|2000|p=38}}\n\nAdditionally, the outbreak coincided with the deaths and media focus on the First World War.{{sfn|Crosby| 2003| pp=320\u2013322}} Another explanation involves the age group affected by the disease. The majority of fatalities, from both the war and the epidemic, were among young adults.  The number of war-related deaths of young adults may have overshadowed the deaths caused by flu.{{sfn|Simonsen|Clarke|Schonberger|Arden|1998}}\n\nWhen people read the obituaries, they saw the war or postwar deaths and the deaths from the influenza side by side. Particularly in Europe, where the war's toll was high, the flu may not have had a tremendous psychological impact or may have seemed an extension of the war's tragedies.{{sfn|Simonsen|Clarke|Schonberger|Arden|1998}} The duration of the pandemic and the war could have also played a role. The disease would usually only affect a particular area for a month before leaving. The war, however,  had initially been expected to end quickly but lasted for four years by the time the pandemic struck.\n \n[[File:1918 Influenza epidemic burial site.jpg|thumb|1918 influenza epidemic burial site in [[Auckland]], New Zealand]]\nRegarding global economic effects, many businesses in the entertainment and service industries suffered losses in revenue, while the healthcare industry reported profit gains.{{sfn|Garret|2007|p=}}\nHistorian Nancy Bristow has argued that the pandemic, when combined with the increasing number of women attending college, contributed to the success of women in the field of nursing. This was due in part to the failure of medical doctors, who were predominantly men, to contain and prevent the illness.

The protagonist of the operetta was a stock Don Juan type. [[Federico Romero]], one of the librettists, quipped that the play's most popular musical number, ''Naples Soldier'', was as catchy as the flu.

She based this on the reported symptoms in those dying from the flu, as reported in the [[post mortem]] reports still available, and also the timing of the big \"death spike\" in October 1918. This occurred shortly after the [[Surgeon General of the United States Army|Surgeon General of the U.S. Army]] and the ''[[JAMA (journal)|Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' both recommended very large doses of 8 to 31&nbsp;grams of [[aspirin]] per day as part of treatment. These levels will produce [[hyperventilation]] in 33% of patients, as well as [[lung edema]] in 3% of patients.{{sfn|Starko|2009}}\n\nStarko also notes that many early deaths showed \"wet\", sometimes hemorrhagic lungs, whereas late deaths showed bacterial pneumonia. She suggests that the wave of aspirin poisonings was due to a \"[[perfect storm]]\" of events: [[Bayer]]'s patent on aspirin expired, so many companies rushed in to make a profit and greatly increased the supply; this coincided with the Spanish flu; and the symptoms of aspirin poisoning were not known at the time.{{sfn|Starko|2009}}\n\n[[File:165-WW-269B-11-trolley-l.jpg|thumb|upright|A street car conductor in [[Seattle]] in 1918 refusing to allow passengers aboard who are not wearing masks]]\nAs an explanation for the universally high mortality rate, this hypothesis was questioned in a letter to the journal published in April 2010 by Andrew Noymer and Daisy Carreon of the [[University of California, Irvine]], and Niall Johnson of the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care. They questioned the universal applicability of the aspirin theory, given the high mortality rate in countries such as India, where there was little or no access to aspirin at the time, compared to the death rate in places where aspirin was plentiful.{{sfn|Noymer|Carreon|Johnson|2010}}\n\nThey concluded that \"the [[Salicylic acid|salicylate]] [aspirin] poisoning hypothesis [was] difficult to sustain as the primary explanation for the unusual virulence of the 1918\u20131919 influenza pandemic\".{{sfn|Noymer|Carreon|Johnson|2010}} In response, Starko said there was [[anecdotal evidence]] of aspirin use in India and argued that even if aspirin over-prescription had not contributed to the high Indian mortality rate, it could still have been a factor for high rates in areas where other exacerbating factors present in India played less of a role.{{sfn|Starko|2010}}\n\n=== End of the pandemic ===\nAfter the lethal second wave struck in late 1918, new cases dropped abruptly&nbsp;\u2013 almost to nothing after the peak in the second wave.{{sfn|Barry| 2004 }} In Philadelphia, for example, 4,597&nbsp;people died in the week ending 16&nbsp;October, but by 11&nbsp;November, influenza had almost disappeared from the city. One explanation for the rapid decline in the lethality of the disease is that doctors became more effective in prevention and treatment of the pneumonia that developed after the victims had contracted the virus. However, John Barry stated in his 2004 book ''[[The Great Influenza: The Epic Story of the Deadliest Plague In History]]'' that researchers have found no evidence to support this position.{{sfn|Barry|2004b}} Some fatal cases did continue into March 1919, killing one player in the [[1919 Stanley Cup Finals]].\n\nAnother theory holds that the 1918 virus mutated extremely rapidly to a less lethal strain. This is a common occurrence with influenza viruses: there is a tendency for pathogenic viruses to become less lethal with time, as the hosts of more dangerous strains tend to die out{{sfn|Barry|2004b}} (see also [[Spanish flu#Deadly second wave|\"Deadly Second Wave\"]], above).\n\n=== Long-term effects ===\nA 2006 study in the ''Journal of Political Economy'' found that \"cohorts ''in utero'' during the pandemic displayed reduced educational attainment, increased rates of physical disability, lower income, lower socioeconomic status, and higher [[transfer payments]] received compared with other birth cohorts.\"<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Almond |first=Douglas |date=1 August 2006 |title=Is the 1918 Influenza Pandemic Over?

The rapid pace of the pandemic, which, for example, killed most of its victims in the United States within less than nine months, resulted in limited media coverage. The general population was familiar with patterns of pandemic disease in the late 19th and early 20th centuries: typhoid, [[yellow fever]], [[diphtheria]] and cholera all occurred near the same time. These outbreaks probably lessened the significance of the influenza pandemic for the public.{{sfn|Morrisey|1986|p=}} In some areas, the flu was not reported on, the only mention being that of advertisements for medicines claiming to cure it.{{sfn|Benedict|Braithwaite|2000|p=38}}\n\nAdditionally, the outbreak coincided with the deaths and media focus on the First World War.{{sfn|Crosby| 2003| pp=320\u2013322}} Another explanation involves the age group affected by the disease. The majority of fatalities, from both the war and the epidemic, were among young adults.  The number of war-related deaths of young adults may have overshadowed the deaths caused by flu.{{sfn|Simonsen|Clarke|Schonberger|Arden|1998}}\n\nWhen people read the obituaries, they saw the war or postwar deaths and the deaths from the influenza side by side. Particularly in Europe, where the war's toll was high, the flu may not have had a tremendous psychological impact or may have seemed an extension of the war's tragedies.{{sfn|Simonsen|Clarke|Schonberger|Arden|1998}} The duration of the pandemic and the war could have also played a role. The disease would usually only affect a particular area for a month before leaving.

The nickname for the flu, the \"Naples Soldier\", was adopted from Federico Romero and [[Guillermo Fern\u00e1ndez Shaw]]'s 1916 operetta, ''The Song of Forgetting'' (''La canci\u00f3n del olvido''). The protagonist of the operetta was a stock Don Juan type. [[Federico Romero]], one of the librettists, quipped that the play's most popular musical number, ''Naples Soldier'', was as catchy as the flu. Davis argued the Spanish flu\u2013Don Juan connection allowed Spaniards to make sense of their epidemic experience by interpreting it through their familiar Don Juan story.{{sfn|Davis| 2013| pp=103\u2013136}}\n\n== Research ==\n{{Main|Spanish flu research}}\n\n[[File:Reconstructed Spanish Flu Virus.jpg|thumb|An electron micrograph showing recreated 1918 influenza virions]]\n[[File:Influenza virus research.jpg|thumb|upright|At the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], Terrence Tumpey examines a reconstructed version of the 1918 flu.]]\n\nThe origin of the Spanish flu pandemic, and the relationship between the near-simultaneous outbreaks in humans and swine, have been controversial.

Because pigs are more readily infected with avian influenza viruses than are humans, they were suggested as the original recipients of the virus, passing the virus to humans sometime between 1913 and 1918.\n\nAn effort to recreate the 1918 flu strain (a subtype of avian strain H1N1) was a collaboration among the [[Armed Forces Institute of Pathology]], the [[USDA]] [[Agricultural Research Service|ARS]] Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory, and [[Mount Sinai School of Medicine]] in [[New York City]].

Inside he discovers thirteen [[Compact Cassette|cassette]] tapes recorded by [[Hannah Baker]], his deceased classmate who killed herself two weeks earlier. On the tapes, Hannah unfolds an intensely emotional audio diary, detailing why she decided to end her life. It appears each person who receives this package of old-style tapes is fundamentally related to why she killed herself. Clay is not the first to receive the tapes, but there is an implication that he should pass the tapes on after hearing them. There appears to be an order to distribution of the tapes, with an additional copy held by an overseer should the plan go awry. Each tape recording refers to a different person involved in Hannah's life contributing to a reason for her suicide (mostly referring to both her friends and enemies).<ref>[https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Differences-Between-13-Reasons-Why-Book-TV-Show-4340472519 Big Differences Between the Book and TV Show Versions of 13 Reasons Why|POPSUGAR Entertainment]</ref>\n\nIn season two, months after Hannah's suicide, Clay and the other people mentioned on the tapes, as well as close friends and Hannah's family members, become embroiled in a civil legal battle between Hannah's parents and Liberty High School. Alleging negligence on the part of the school, Hannah's mother pursues her perception of justice, while her reluctance to settle pre-trial and her personal circumstances eventually break up her marriage with Hannah's father. The story unfolds with narratives illustrating Hannah's story told by those who were present in court at the trial.\n\nClay, who perceives himself as Hannah's failed protector, embarks on an investigation using whatever evidence he can find in an effort to impact on the civil case between Hannah's parents and the school. Clay also endeavors to expose the corrupted culture of the high school and its favor of wealthy [[Jock (stereotype)|jocks]] over the average student, which especially compromises the integrity of young girls such as Hannah.\n\nSeason three is set eight months after the end of season two. Clay and his friends are struggling to cope with the cover-up of Tyler's attempted massacre at the Spring Fling, while helping him towards recovery. However, acrimonious tensions reach a boiling point during Liberty High's Homecoming game, which results in the murder of Bryce Walker. The students of Liberty High are once again forced under the microscope as the investigation into Bryce's death threatens to expose their darkest secrets. <!-- , while the factual basis of the dramatic portrayals of the various events increasingly blur between actual portrayal and the desired perception of the various characters who present before the court during the trial. --> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.popsugar.com/node/43405054|title=4 Reasons There Should Not Be Another Season of 13 Reasons Why|last=Robson|first=Shannon Vestal|date=April 28, 2017|website=POPSUGAR Entertainment|language=en-US|access-date=October 7, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{multiple image\n| align  = right\n| footer = [[Dylan Minnette]] and [[Katherine Langford]]\n| image1 = Dylan Minnette in 2018.jpg\n| width1 = 136\n| image2 = Katherine Langford in 2018.jpg\n| width2 = 120\n}}\n\n===Main===\n* [[Dylan Minnette]] as [[Clay Jensen]], a close friend of Hannah who becomes obsessed with finding out what happened to her<ref name=\"S1Cast\" />\n* [[Katherine Langford]] as [[Hannah Baker]], a teenager whose suicide and recorded audio cassettes spark the events of the series<ref name=\"S1Cast\" /> (seasons 1\u20132)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ew.com/tv/2018/05/25/13-reasons-why-katherine-langford-goodbye-hannah-baker/|title='13 Reasons Why': Katherine Langford says goodbye to Hannah Baker|website=EW.com|language=en|access-date=October 7, 2019}}</ref>\n* [[Christian Navarro]] as Tony Padilla, Clay's best friend at Liberty High who tries to help him deal with Hannah's death\n* [[Alisha Boe]] as Jessica Davis, a student who starts attending Liberty High at the same time as Hannah<ref name=\"S1Cast\" />\n* [[Brandon Flynn]] as Justin Foley,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/09/241936/who-is-13-reasons-why-brandon-flynn-dating-now|title=Is Brandon Flynn Of 13 Reasons Why Dating Anyone After His Last Big Breakup?| first=Alexis|last=Reliford|date=September 1, 2019|accessdate=February 24, 2020|work=[[Refinery29]]}}</ref> a student at Liberty High who comes from an abusive family and is in a relationship with Jessica.<ref name=\"S1Cast\" /> He is responsible for setting the events of the series into motion by being the first person to humiliate Hannah after their first date.

Schedeen of [[IGN]] praised the cast, particularly Minnette and Langford, stating: \"Langford shines in the lead role{{nbsp}}... [and] embodies that optimism and that profound sadness [of Hannah's] as well. Minnette's Clay is, by design, a much more stoic and reserved character{{nbsp}}... and does a fine job in what's often a difficult role.\"<ref name=\"IGNresponse\" /> Gilbert of ''The Boston Globe'' praised the chemistry of Langford and Minnette, saying that \"watching these two young actors together is pure pleasure\", while Schedeen of IGN also agreed, saying that they are \"often at their best together, channeling just the right sort of warm but awkward chemistry you'd expect from two teens who can't quite admit to their feelings for one another\". Feinberg of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' also praises both actors: \"Langford's heartbreaking openness makes you root for a fate you know isn't possible. The actress' performance is full of dynamic range, setting it against Minnette's often more complicated task in differentiating between moods that mostly go from uncomfortable to gloomy to red-eyed, hygiene-starved despair.\"<ref name=\"THRresponse\" />\n\nRyan of ''Variety'' also gave praise to not only the two leads, but also the supporting cast of actors, particularly Kate Walsh's performance as Hannah's mother, which Ryan describes as \"career-best work\".<ref name=\"Varietyresponse\" /> Positive mentions from various critics, such as Ryan, Feinberg and Schedeen, were also given to the supporting cast of actors (most particularly Alisha Boe, Miles Heizer and Christian Navarro's respective performances of Jessica, Alex and Tony).

Feinberg highlighted the series' directors, saying: \"A Sundance-friendly gallery of directors including Tom McCarthy, Gregg Araki and Carl Franklin keeps the performances grounded and the extremes from feeling exploitative\",<ref name=\"Indiewireresponse\" /> while Gilbert of ''The Boston Globe'' praised the storytelling: \"The storytelling techniques are powerful{{nbsp}}...

Mike Hale of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote a critical review, writing, \"the show doesn't make [Hannah's] downward progress convincing. It too often feels artificial, like a very long public service announcement.\" He also criticized the plot device that has Clay listening to the tapes one by one instead of all in one sitting like the other teens did, which Hale felt was unbelievable: \"It makes no sense as anything but a plot device, and you'll find yourself, like Clay's antagonists, yelling at him to listen to the rest of tapes already.\"<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hale |first1=Mike |title=Review: '13 Reasons Why' She Killed Herself, Drawn Out on Netflix |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/arts/television/netflix-13-reasons-why-tv-review.html |accessdate=April 10, 2017 |work=The New York Times |date=March 30, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170410165508/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/arts/television/netflix-13-reasons-why-tv-review.html |archivedate=April 10, 2017}}</ref>\n\nWriting for ''[[The Guardian]]'', Rebecca Nicholson praised some aspects of the series, including the performances from Minnette and Walsh, but was troubled by much of the plot, writing, \"a storyline that suggests the love of a sweet boy might have sorted all this out added to an uneasy feeling that stayed with me\". Nicholson was skeptical that the series would appeal to older viewers, unlike other series set in high school such as ''[[Freaks and Geeks]]'' and ''[[My So-Called Life]]'': \"It lacks the crossover wit of its forebears{{nbsp}}... It's too tied up in conveying the message that terrible behaviour can have horrible consequences to deal in any subtleties or shades of feeling. It's largely one-note \u2013 and that note is horrifying.

At times, [Hannah] is self-possessed and indifferent at best to the behavior of the popular kids.

Alex Moen, a [[school counselor]] in Minneapolis, took issue with the series' entire plotline as \"essentially a fantasy of what someone who is considering suicide might have\u2014that once you commit suicide, you can still communicate with your loved ones, and people will suddenly realize everything that you were going through and the depth of your pain{{nbsp}}... That the cute, sensitive boy will fall in love with you and seek justice for you, and you'll be able to orchestrate it, and in so doing kind of still be able to live.\"<ref name=\"Slate piece\" /> Other counselors criticized the depiction of Hannah's attempt to reach out to Mr. Porter as dangerously misleading, since not only does he miss obvious signs of her suicidal ideations, but says he cannot report her sexual assault to the police without her identifying the assailant. School counselors are often portrayed as ineffective or clueless in popular culture, Moen says, but Porter's behavior in the series goes beyond that, to being unethical and possibly illegal. \"It's ridiculous! Counselors are not police. We don't have to launch an investigation. We bring whatever information we do have to the police\", she told ''[[Slate (website)|Slate]]''.<ref name=\"Slate piece\" />\n\nIn May 2017, the [[Canadian Mental Health Association]] (CMHA) along with the Centre for Suicide Prevention (CSP) released a statement with similar concerns to the ones raised by NASP. CMHA believed that the series may glamorize suicide, and that some content may lead to distress in viewers, particularly in younger viewers. Furthermore, the portrayal of Hannah's suicide does not follow the media guidelines as set out by the Canadian Association for Suicide Prevention (CASP) and the [[American Association of Suicidology]]. CMHA and CASP did praise the series for raising awareness about \"[[suicide|this preventable health concern]],\" adding that, \"Raising awareness needs to be done in a safe and responsible manner. A large and growing body of Canadian and international research has found clear links between increases in suicide rates and harmful media portrayals of suicide.\" Ways in which the portrayals of suicide may cause harm, according to CMHA and CASP, include the following: \"They may simplify suicide, such as, by suggesting that bullying alone is the cause; they may make suicide seem romantic, such as, by putting it in the context of a Hollywood plot line; they may portray suicide as a logical or viable option; they may display graphic representations of suicide which may be harmful to viewers, especially young ones; and/or they may advance the false notion that suicides are a way to teach others a lesson.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cmha.ca/news/cmha-national-statement-responding-netflix-series-13-reasons/ |title=CMHA National Statement Responding to Netflix Series: 13 Reasons Why \u2013 Canadian Mental Health Association |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170504044326/http://www.cmha.ca/news/cmha-national-statement-responding-netflix-series-13-reasons/ |archivedate=May 4, 2017}}</ref><ref>[http://www.nasponline.org/assets/documents/Resources%20and%20Publications/Resources/Crisis/13%20Reasons%20Why%20Guidance_FINAL.pdf National Association of School Psychologists.

for [[Netflix]] as limited series by [[Brian Yorkey]], based on the 2007 novel ''[[Thirteen Reasons Why]]'' by [[Jay Asher]]. The series revolves around a seventeen-year-old high school student [[Clay Jensen]] and his deceased friend [[Hannah Baker]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/13-reasons-why/1032508|title=13 Reasons Why {{!}} TV Guide|website=TVGuide.com|language=en|access-date=2020-01-17}}</ref> who takes her own life after having to face a culture of gossip, bullying and sexual assault at her high school and a lack of support from her friends, her family and her school. A box of [[Compact Cassette|cassette tapes]] recorded by Hannah in the weeks preceding her suicide detail why she chose to end her life. The series is produced by July Moon Productions, Kicked to the Curb Productions, [[Anonymous Content]] and [[Paramount Television]], with Yorkey and [[Diana Son]] serving as [[showrunners]].\n\n[[Dylan Minnette]] stars as Clay Jensen, while [[Katherine Langford]] plays [[Hannah Baker]].

A film from [[Universal Pictures]] based on ''Thirteen Reasons Why'' began development in February 2011, with [[Selena Gomez]] set to star as Hannah, before being shelved in favor of a television series and Netflix ordering an adaptation as a limited series in October 2015, with Gomez instead serving as an executive producer. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/selena-gomez-13-reasons-why-netflix-1201620194/ |title=Netflix Adapting '13 Reasons Why' Into Selena Gomez Series (Exclusive) |last=Wagmeister |first=Elizabeth |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=October 29, 2015 |accessdate=June 14, 2018}}</ref>\n\nInitially launched as a miniseries, the first season was released on Netflix on March 31, 2017.

Inside he discovers thirteen [[Compact Cassette|cassette]] tapes recorded by [[Hannah Baker]], his deceased classmate who killed herself two weeks earlier. On the tapes, Hannah unfolds an intensely emotional audio diary, detailing why she decided to end her life. It appears each person who receives this package of old-style tapes is fundamentally related to why she killed herself. Clay is not the first to receive the tapes, but there is an implication that he should pass the tapes on after hearing them. There appears to be an order to distribution of the tapes, with an additional copy held by an overseer should the plan go awry. Each tape recording refers to a different person involved in Hannah's life contributing to a reason for her suicide (mostly referring to both her friends and enemies).<ref>[https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Differences-Between-13-Reasons-Why-Book-TV-Show-4340472519 Big Differences Between the Book and TV Show Versions of 13 Reasons Why|POPSUGAR Entertainment]</ref>\n\nIn season two, months after Hannah's suicide, Clay and the other people mentioned on the tapes, as well as close friends and Hannah's family members, become embroiled in a civil legal battle between Hannah's parents and Liberty High School. Alleging negligence on the part of the school, Hannah's mother pursues her perception of justice, while her reluctance to settle pre-trial and her personal circumstances eventually break up her marriage with Hannah's father. The story unfolds with narratives illustrating Hannah's story told by those who were present in court at the trial.\n\nClay, who perceives himself as Hannah's failed protector, embarks on an investigation using whatever evidence he can find in an effort to impact on the civil case between Hannah's parents and the school. Clay also endeavors to expose the corrupted culture of the high school and its favor of wealthy [[Jock (stereotype)|jocks]] over the average student, which especially compromises the integrity of young girls such as Hannah.\n\nSeason three is set eight months after the end of season two. Clay and his friends are struggling to cope with the cover-up of Tyler's attempted massacre at the Spring Fling, while helping him towards recovery. However, acrimonious tensions reach a boiling point during Liberty High's Homecoming game, which results in the murder of Bryce Walker. The students of Liberty High are once again forced under the microscope as the investigation into Bryce's death threatens to expose their darkest secrets. <!-- , while the factual basis of the dramatic portrayals of the various events increasingly blur between actual portrayal and the desired perception of the various characters who present before the court during the trial. --> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.popsugar.com/node/43405054|title=4 Reasons There Should Not Be Another Season of 13 Reasons Why|last=Robson|first=Shannon Vestal|date=April 28, 2017|website=POPSUGAR Entertainment|language=en-US|access-date=October 7, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{multiple image\n| align  = right\n| footer = [[Dylan Minnette]] and [[Katherine Langford]]\n| image1 = Dylan Minnette in 2018.jpg\n| width1 = 136\n| image2 = Katherine Langford in 2018.jpg\n| width2 = 120\n}}\n\n===Main===\n* [[Dylan Minnette]] as [[Clay Jensen]], a close friend of Hannah who becomes obsessed with finding out what happened to her<ref name=\"S1Cast\" />\n* [[Katherine Langford]] as [[Hannah Baker]], a teenager whose suicide and recorded audio cassettes spark the events of the series<ref name=\"S1Cast\" /> (seasons 1\u20132)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ew.com/tv/2018/05/25/13-reasons-why-katherine-langford-goodbye-hannah-baker/|title='13 Reasons Why': Katherine Langford says goodbye to Hannah Baker|website=EW.com|language=en|access-date=October 7, 2019}}</ref>\n* [[Christian Navarro]] as Tony Padilla, Clay's best friend at Liberty High who tries to help him deal with Hannah's death\n* [[Alisha Boe]] as Jessica Davis, a student who starts attending Liberty High at the same time as Hannah<ref name=\"S1Cast\" />\n* [[Brandon Flynn]] as Justin Foley,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/09/241936/who-is-13-reasons-why-brandon-flynn-dating-now|title=Is Brandon Flynn Of 13 Reasons Why Dating Anyone After His Last Big Breakup?| first=Alexis|last=Reliford|date=September 1, 2019|accessdate=February 24, 2020|work=[[Refinery29]]}}</ref> a student at Liberty High who comes from an abusive family and is in a relationship with Jessica.<ref name=\"S1Cast\" /> He is responsible for setting the events of the series into motion by being the first person to humiliate Hannah after their first date.

Schedeen of [[IGN]] praised the cast, particularly Minnette and Langford, stating: \"Langford shines in the lead role{{nbsp}}... [and] embodies that optimism and that profound sadness [of Hannah's] as well. Minnette's Clay is, by design, a much more stoic and reserved character{{nbsp}}... and does a fine job in what's often a difficult role.\"<ref name=\"IGNresponse\" /> Gilbert of ''The Boston Globe'' praised the chemistry of Langford and Minnette, saying that \"watching these two young actors together is pure pleasure\", while Schedeen of IGN also agreed, saying that they are \"often at their best together, channeling just the right sort of warm but awkward chemistry you'd expect from two teens who can't quite admit to their feelings for one another\". Feinberg of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' also praises both actors: \"Langford's heartbreaking openness makes you root for a fate you know isn't possible. The actress' performance is full of dynamic range, setting it against Minnette's often more complicated task in differentiating between moods that mostly go from uncomfortable to gloomy to red-eyed, hygiene-starved despair.\"<ref name=\"THRresponse\" />\n\nRyan of ''Variety'' also gave praise to not only the two leads, but also the supporting cast of actors, particularly Kate Walsh's performance as Hannah's mother, which Ryan describes as \"career-best work\".<ref name=\"Varietyresponse\" /> Positive mentions from various critics, such as Ryan, Feinberg and Schedeen, were also given to the supporting cast of actors (most particularly Alisha Boe, Miles Heizer and Christian Navarro's respective performances of Jessica, Alex and Tony).

Mike Hale of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote a critical review, writing, \"the show doesn't make [Hannah's] downward progress convincing. It too often feels artificial, like a very long public service announcement.\" He also criticized the plot device that has Clay listening to the tapes one by one instead of all in one sitting like the other teens did, which Hale felt was unbelievable: \"It makes no sense as anything but a plot device, and you'll find yourself, like Clay's antagonists, yelling at him to listen to the rest of tapes already.\"<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hale |first1=Mike |title=Review: '13 Reasons Why' She Killed Herself, Drawn Out on Netflix |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/arts/television/netflix-13-reasons-why-tv-review.html |accessdate=April 10, 2017 |work=The New York Times |date=March 30, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170410165508/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/arts/television/netflix-13-reasons-why-tv-review.html |archivedate=April 10, 2017}}</ref>\n\nWriting for ''[[The Guardian]]'', Rebecca Nicholson praised some aspects of the series, including the performances from Minnette and Walsh, but was troubled by much of the plot, writing, \"a storyline that suggests the love of a sweet boy might have sorted all this out added to an uneasy feeling that stayed with me\". Nicholson was skeptical that the series would appeal to older viewers, unlike other series set in high school such as ''[[Freaks and Geeks]]'' and ''[[My So-Called Life]]'': \"It lacks the crossover wit of its forebears{{nbsp}}... It's too tied up in conveying the message that terrible behaviour can have horrible consequences to deal in any subtleties or shades of feeling.

At times, [Hannah] is self-possessed and indifferent at best to the behavior of the popular kids.

Each warning voice over is read by a different cast member at the end of the episode, with Katherine Langford reading in her native Australian accent in her voice-overs. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.communitynews.com.au/cockburn-gazette/news/13-reasons-headspace-issues-warning-new-netflix-show/ |title=13 Reasons Why: Headspace issues warning over new Netflix show |date=April 18, 2017 |publisher=[[Community Newspaper Group]] |accessdate=April 19, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170419101534/http://www.communitynews.com.au/cockburn-gazette/news/13-reasons-headspace-issues-warning-new-netflix-show/ |archivedate=April 19, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/headspace-issues-warning-against-netflix-show-13-reasons-why/news-story/02014de19bd8daee573224c0c714eeae |title=Netflix series 13 Reasons Why under fire from mental health experts |work=news.com.au |accessdate=April 19, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170418233845/http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/headspace-issues-warning-against-netflix-show-13-reasons-why/news-story/02014de19bd8daee573224c0c714eeae |archivedate=April 18, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.headspace.org.au/news/dangerous-content-in-13-reasons-why/ |title=headspace: dangerous content in 13 Reasons Why |work=headspace.org.au |accessdate=April 19, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170419104903/https://www.headspace.org.au/news/dangerous-content-in-13-reasons-why/ |archivedate=April 19, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn response to the graphic nature of the series and New Zealand's high youth suicide rate, which was the highest among the 34{{efn|name=OECD note|The 2009\u20132012 data exclude Latvia, which became the 35th OECD member country on July 1, 2016.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oecd.org/document/58/0,3746,en_2649_201185_1889402_1_1_1_1,00.html |title=List of OECD Member countries \u2013 Ratification of the Convention on the OECD |website=Oecd.org |accessdate=April 28, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123031730/http://www.oecd.org/document/58/0%2C3746%2Cen_2649_201185_1889402_1_1_1_1%2C00.html |archivedate=November 23, 2015}}</ref>}} [[OECD]] countries during 2009 to 2012,<ref>{{cite web |title=The Social Report 2016 \u2013 Te p\u016brongo oranga tangata |url=http://socialreport.msd.govt.nz/health/suicide.html |publisher=Ministry of Social Development \u2013 New Zealand Government |accessdate=April 28, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170406215234/http://socialreport.msd.govt.nz/health/suicide.html |archivedate=April 6, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Mconnell |first1=Glenn |title=The highest rate of teen suicide in the developed world |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/85305366/the-highest-rate-of-teen-suicide-in-the-developed-world |website=Stuff.co.nz |accessdate=April 28, 2017}}</ref> the [[Office of Film and Literature Classification (New Zealand)|Office of Film & Literature Classification]] in the country created a new rating, \"RP18\", allowing individuals aged 18 and over to watch the series alone and those below having to watch it with supervision from a parent or guardian.<ref>{{cite web |title=New Zealand teens can only watch Netflix show 13 Reasons Why with their parents |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/39732715/new-zealand-teens-can-only-watch-netflix-show-13-reasons-why-with-their-parents |website=BBC |accessdate=April 28, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170427212208/http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/39732715/new-zealand-teens-can-only-watch-netflix-show-13-reasons-why-with-their-parents |archivedate=April 27, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=13 Reasons Why: Censors make new RP18 rating for controversial Netflix show |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/tv-radio/91956245/13-reasons-why-censors-make-new-rp18-rating-for-controversial-netflix-show |website=stuff.co.nz |accessdate=April 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\n{{quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=We stayed very true to the book and that's initially what [author] [[Jay Asher]] created was a beautifully tragic, complicated yet suspenseful story and I think that's what we wanted to do{{nbsp}}...

Alex Moen, a [[school counselor]] in Minneapolis, took issue with the series' entire plotline as \"essentially a fantasy of what someone who is considering suicide might have\u2014that once you commit suicide, you can still communicate with your loved ones, and people will suddenly realize everything that you were going through and the depth of your pain{{nbsp}}... That the cute, sensitive boy will fall in love with you and seek justice for you, and you'll be able to orchestrate it, and in so doing kind of still be able to live.\"<ref name=\"Slate piece\" /> Other counselors criticized the depiction of Hannah's attempt to reach out to Mr. Porter as dangerously misleading, since not only does he miss obvious signs of her suicidal ideations, but says he cannot report her sexual assault to the police without her identifying the assailant. School counselors are often portrayed as ineffective or clueless in popular culture, Moen says, but Porter's behavior in the series goes beyond that, to being unethical and possibly illegal. \"It's ridiculous! Counselors are not police. We don't have to launch an investigation. We bring whatever information we do have to the police\", she told ''[[Slate (website)|Slate]]''.<ref name=\"Slate piece\" />\n\nIn May 2017, the [[Canadian Mental Health Association]] (CMHA) along with the Centre for Suicide Prevention (CSP) released a statement with similar concerns to the ones raised by NASP. CMHA believed that the series may glamorize suicide, and that some content may lead to distress in viewers, particularly in younger viewers. Furthermore, the portrayal of Hannah's suicide does not follow the media guidelines as set out by the Canadian Association for Suicide Prevention (CASP) and the [[American Association of Suicidology]]. CMHA and CASP did praise the series for raising awareness about \"[[suicide|this preventable health concern]],\" adding that, \"Raising awareness needs to be done in a safe and responsible manner. A large and growing body of Canadian and international research has found clear links between increases in suicide rates and harmful media portrayals of suicide.\" Ways in which the portrayals of suicide may cause harm, according to CMHA and CASP, include the following: \"They may simplify suicide, such as, by suggesting that bullying alone is the cause; they may make suicide seem romantic, such as, by putting it in the context of a Hollywood plot line; they may portray suicide as a logical or viable option; they may display graphic representations of suicide which may be harmful to viewers, especially young ones; and/or they may advance the false notion that suicides are a way to teach others a lesson.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cmha.ca/news/cmha-national-statement-responding-netflix-series-13-reasons/ |title=CMHA National Statement Responding to Netflix Series: 13 Reasons Why \u2013 Canadian Mental Health Association |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170504044326/http://www.cmha.ca/news/cmha-national-statement-responding-netflix-series-13-reasons/ |archivedate=May 4, 2017}}</ref><ref>[http://www.nasponline.org/assets/documents/Resources%20and%20Publications/Resources/Crisis/13%20Reasons%20Why%20Guidance_FINAL.pdf National Association of School Psychologists.

Contemporary journalism studies define multimedia journalism in two ways, both emphasising on the rapid development of technology which facilitates newsroom adapt to contemporary convergent news ecology.\n\nIn the first definition, scholars believe that the World Wide Web is regarded as the fundamental vehicle used by news agencies, conveying information that comes in contact with the audience.<ref name=\"Sundar 480\u2013499\">{{Cite journal|last=Sundar|first=S.

According to Steen Steensen, online news stories are not universally driven by multi-modality, since they sometimes are only presented in text with images.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Steensen|first=Steen|date=2009-02-01|title=Online Feature Journalism|journal=Journalism Practice|volume=3|issue=1|pages=13\u201329|doi=10.1080/17512780802560716|issn=1751-2786|hdl=10642/356}}</ref> Whereas multi media journalism contains more than two media elements, including but not limited to written words and photographs.\n\nThe first genre of multimedia journalism contains two basic storytelling formats: Christmas Tree and Embedded Multimedia Stories.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://multimedia.journalism.berkeley.edu/tutorials/taxonomy-digital-story-packages/|title=Taxonomy of Digital Story Packages - Berkeley Advanced Media Institute|date=2014-09-29|work=Berkeley Advanced Media Institute|access-date=2017-03-14|language=en-US}}</ref> The former refers to the multimedia elements are positioned \"to the side of the main text story like ornaments hung on a tree\". For example, videos, charts and images are stacked on the right side of the web page as the secondary role in the storytelling. The latter, conversely, privilege the role of multimedia elements in news reporting. Instead of being placed aside of the main news body, multimedia technologies are embedded into the coverage as an inseparable part of the reporting.\n\nSecondly, as the result of media convergence, multimedia journalism is defined as the production and distribution of news coverage via a variety of communication platforms, such as newspaper, television, radio, websites, social media, and so on.<ref name=\":0\" /> In this case, multimedia journalists produce different format of news content with regards to various communication forums, leading from a mono media to a multimedia news culture.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=Handbooks in Communication and Media : Handbook of Global Online Journalism (1)|last=Paulussen|first=Steve|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2012|isbn=9781118313954|location=|pages=197\u2013198}}</ref>\n\n== Convergence ==\n[[Media convergence]] is a multi-dimensional concept defined by several scholars. It can refer to the combination of computing and information technology, communication networks, and digitized media content.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=New media : an introduction|last=Richard.|first=Smith|date=2014-01-01|publisher=Oxford Univ.

At the information-gathering level, Journalism collect sources for multiple platforms, as well as sharing stories with their counterparts. During the process of allocation and production, editors and producers decide the coverage of news stories, selecting sources from those gathered by journalists from different newsrooms. Finally, at the stage of distribution, news agencies disseminate news through various media platforms, including newspapers, websites, television, radio, and so on.\n\nFrom an industrial perspective, large news agencies today are opting for more than one form of cross-media cooperation, employing journalists for a variety of news distributing platforms, including printing, broadcasting, and online disseminating. In other words, rather than emphasizing on a single media form, contemporary  journalistic information is accessed to the audience through more than one channel. However, the practical operation of media convergence varies among different news organizations. Influential factors distinguish the shape and size of the convergence constituted by both internal practices and the external pressure. For internal factors on the one hand, an example would be the lack of consensus among the allocative and operational level, such as shareholders, editors, and publishers. External influences, on the other hand, are mostly came from the pressure of horizontal competition, political regulations, and the transformation of the news ecology.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFrom a business perspective, media convergence is regarded as a strategy for saving costs. Journalism as an industry itself, is inseparably linked with a business ends for generating high profit. Labors thus are required to proficiently produce multi-media news content with technical skills. As a result, an increase in revenue can be received when the news content is distributed efficiently through a variety of platforms.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|last=Avil\u00e9s|first=Jos\u00e9 Alberto Garc\u00eda|last2=Carvajal|first2=Miguel|date=2008-05-01|title=Integrated and Cross-Media Newsroom Convergence: Two Models of Multimedia News Production \u2014 The Cases of Novot\u00e9cnica and La Verdad Multimedia in Spain|journal=Convergence|language=en|volume=14|issue=2|pages=221\u2013239|doi=10.1177/1354856507087945|issn=1354-8565}}</ref>\n\n== Reasons for transformation ==\nMultimedia journalism is perceived as a revolutionary transformation in information and communications. It does not only challenge the traditional newsroom organization and management, but also changes the existing business model. Driving by a sheer goal of keeping corporations profitable, today's news are not primarily expected to serve as a public good. In order to generate higher profit, news agencies are producing more content accessible to an expanded size of audience through various distribution platforms. The driving force of multimedia journalism includes two ends, a \"push\" end and a \"pull\" side.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Martyn|first=Peter H.|date=2009-04-01|title=The Mojo in the Third Millennium|journal=Journalism Practice|volume=3|issue=2|pages=196\u2013215|doi=10.1080/17512780802681264|issn=1751-2786}}</ref>\n\nThe \"push\" end refers to the news providers' intention that want to migrate readers from physical printing news media to digitized platforms. The rapid growth of technology and the popularization of the Internet have fundamentally affected the business model of journalism.  Advertising as the main driving force of production, target audience can be expanded as the news content is distributed through multiple platforms. Even though physical newspapers is still maintained its prominent position in distribution, the profit from digital sales constitutes a large percentage of the revenue for the industry.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Quinn|first=Stephen|date=2004-12-01|title=An Intersection of Ideals: Journalism, Profits, Technology and Convergence|journal=Convergence|language=en|volume=10|issue=4|pages=109\u2013123|doi=10.1177/135485650401000409|issn=1354-8565}}</ref>\n\nThere is also a \"pull\" factor with respect to transformation of journalism. The emergence of digital natives who grow up with new media, speaking the digital language of computers and the Internet, make news providers adjust news formats. Young generations tend to be more proficiently engaged with new technologies, even spend their entire lives surrounded by digital media. With regards to those who are being a part of the \"digital natives\" instead of preferring traditional news coverage form, news agencies are adapting to the new environment to serve the various needs of audience.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Impacts ==\n\n=== Impact on readers ===\nNews media as the vehicle that conveys information facilitate mass communication, does not only produce and distribute news, but also enhances the relationship between news providers and readers. Traditional journalism based on single medium defines the role of readers as the recipient and the consumer of information. Journalists thus serve as gatekeepers, deciding which source to cover, and what kind of information the public need to know.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bossio|first=Diana|last2=Bebawi|first2=Saba|date=2016-11-01|title=Mapping the emergence of social media in everyday journalistic practices|journal=Media International Australia|language=en|volume=161|issue=1|pages=147\u2013158|doi=10.1177/1329878X16665494|issn=1329-878X}}</ref> News reporting through the television broadcasting, for example, is led by the reporter who is responsible for disseminating information to large audiences. However, with the development of technology, especially the Internet, the role of traditional news providers and readers are changed.\n\nEconomically, the consuming behavior of mass audience is influenced by multimedia journalism. As the consumer of information, traditional readers are passively access to information since there is only single form of news product. Today's consuming practices have changed from passive to active since audience are able to select their preferred medium from a variety of options to receive information.\n\nThe audiences' everyday practices with regards to multimedia journalism is challenging the traditional relationship between journalists and readers. Before the introduction of digital technologies, news providers have realized that they need to broaden their readership scope by providing a forum for public discussion.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Al-Rawi|first=Ahmed|date=2016-03-09|title=News values on social media: News organizations' Facebook use|journal=Journalism|volume=18|issue=7|pages=871\u2013889|language=en|doi=10.1177/1464884916636142|pmid=29278253|pmc=5732590}}</ref> Commentaries and editorial pages on newspaper are thus created for satisfying such needs; however, they are limited in size and accessibility. As news agencies are adapting to the trend of multimedia journalism, readers' voices are able to heard more comprehensively. For example, the interactive feature of new media such as the Internet, especially social media, allowing journalists to directly communicate with their audience on the one hand, also enabling readers to exchange ideas among themselves on the other hand.<ref name=\":3\" />   The emergence of interactive technology therefore undermines  the classical news agenda.  Multimedia journalism converts readers to collaborators, which generates greater contact between journalists and their audience. Audiences are able to access information via more than one platforms as well as comprehending news information in detail. In addition, multiple discussion forums provided by journalism, such as the online comment area under each news report, enabling direct communication between readers and journalists.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Becker|first=Beatriz|last2=de Castro|first2=Laura Maia|date=2014-12-01|title=Innovative writing of the twenty-first century: Multimedia journalism and education|journal=Journal of Applied Journalism & Media Studies|volume=3|issue=3|pages=335\u2013353|doi=10.1386/ajms.3.3.335_1}}</ref>\n\nToday's information culture embedded in the computer-mediated news production also leads transformation in the news habit of individuals.<ref name=\":0\" /> Firstly, the ways of how people understanding the news event and perceiving the world are shaped by images and video, no longer depending on texts. Evidently, As Stephens argues, we are now witnessing the \"rise of the image, and fall of the word\", as contemporary multimedia journalistic sphere is dominated by images, whether still or moving.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Rise of the Image, The Fall of the Word|last=Stephens|first=Mitchell|publisher=New York: Oxford University Press|year=1998|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> Secondly, users are becoming multitasking as the consumption of information in a variety of media is increasing. They tend to produce and consume news content simultaneously through different media. For example, ordinaries can read newspaper and listen to radio broadcasting at the same time.\n\n=== Impact on content ===\nIn convergent times, the scope of journalism has expanded considerably via the multimedia model, serving as an alternative form to traditional news production and consumption. Scholars believe that multimedia are used as an effective extension of the primary news  narrative format.<ref name=\":5\" /> For instance, Benson et al. claim that, with regards to news stories delivered online, even though the main narrative of news report is still the dominant part of journalism, other additional elements such as charts, images, videos are becoming more prevalent today.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Benson|first=Rodney|last2=Blach-\u00d8rsten|first2=Mark|last3=Powers|first3=Matthew|last4=Willig|first4=Ida|last5=Zambrano|first5=Sandra Vera|date=2012-02-01|title=Media Systems Online and Off: Comparing the Form of News in the United States, Denmark, and France|journal=Journal of Communication|language=en|volume=62|issue=1|pages=21\u201338|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2011.01625.x|issn=1460-2466}}</ref>\n\nContent comprehension and knowledge gain are considered as one dimension of the most significant media effects due to its socio-political characteristics.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Delli Carpini|first=Michael|year=2004|title=Mediating democratic engagement: The impact of communications on citizens' involvement in political and civic life.|url=|journal=Handbook of Political Communication Research|volume=|pages= 357\u2013394|via=}}</ref> Studies show that messages transmitted through audiovisual media can enhance emotional responses and lead to better memory. On the one hand, psychological research indicates that some \"negative emotion increase attention, interest, and learning\". When a journalistic story triggers anger, audience are more likely to remember the news report, stimulating political interest thus enhancing the quality of learning.<ref>{{Cite journal|authorlink=Nicholas Valentino|last=Valentino|first=Nicholas A.|last2=Banks|first2=Antoine J.|last3=Hutchings|first3=Vincent L.|last4=Davis|first4=Anne K.|date=2009-08-01|title=Selective Exposure in the Internet Age: The Interaction between Anxiety and Information Utility|journal=Political Psychology|language=en|volume=30|issue=4|pages=591\u2013613|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9221.2009.00716.x|issn=1467-9221}}</ref> On the other hand, compared with solely reading texts, the human brain \"absorbs larger amounts of information when the messages are audiovisual\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Graber|first=Doris A.|authorlink=Doris Graber|date=1996-07-01|title=Say it with Pictures|journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|language=en|volume=546|issue=1|pages=85\u201396|doi=10.1177/0002716296546001008|issn=0002-7162}}</ref> Information presented in multiple modalities do not only attract attention, but multimedia elements also provide readers a diverse decoding method for interpreting and comprehending meaning. As journalism content is delivered through various platforms, it has a greater opportunity to appeal to more receivers than information presented in a single channel. This \"redundancy\" of content, according to Sundar, contributing to \"cognitive rehearsal, thereby enhancing its likelihood of storage in memory\".<ref name=\"Sundar 480\u2013499\"/> Combining pictures, audio, and words in a multimedia context hence leads to better memory and comprehension of that content.\n\nMultimedia report, moreover, contributing to the contextualization of the events covered in news stories.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Becker|first=Beatriz|last2=Castro|first2=Laura Maia de|title=Innovative writing of the twenty-first century: Multimedia journalism and education|url=http://openurl.ingenta.com/content/xref?genre=article&issn=2001-0818&volume=3&issue=3&spage=335|journal=Journal of Applied Journalism & Media Studies|volume=3|issue=3|pages=335\u2013353|doi=10.1386/ajms.3.3.335_1|year=2014}}</ref> By providing real-time report through both traditional broadcasting and digital content, this form of journalistic practice offers clarifications regarding facts or systems difficult to understand. Classical model simply focuses on a single distribution platform, limiting the scope of demonstration. According to Stevens, cross-platform delivery and multimedia content provide additional information and alternative angles while reporting news stories, contributing to the complimentary of journalism.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://multimedia.journalism.berkeley.edu/tutorials/starttofinish/|title=Multimedia Storytelling: learn the secrets from experts - Berkeley Advanced Media Institute|date=2014-09-27|work=Berkeley Advanced Media Institute|access-date=2017-03-25|language=en-US}}</ref> As today's news agencies following the trend of multimedia transformation, news can be presented in a more adequate scope, whether though different media or through additional multimedia elements co-exist in a news report on the webpage. For example, in a news report published through the Internet, by posting a real-time video interview of victims of an earthquake with a chart explaining the different scales of earthquakes, can efficiently inform the public about knowledge of earthquakes.\n\n=== Impact on journalism ideology ===\nRather than simply an emergent communication technology, new media need to be understood with respect to their practical usage. Scholars such as Deuze<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=Deuze|first=Mark|year=2007|title=Media Work|url=|journal=Ecquid Novi: African Journalism Studies|volume=|pages=278|via=}}</ref> and Peters<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Peters|first=Benjamin|date=2009-02-01|title=And lead us not into thinking the new is new: a bibliographic case for new media history|journal=New Media & Society|language=en|volume=11|issue=1\u20132|pages=13\u201330|doi=10.1177/1461444808099572|issn=1461-4448}}</ref> offer an insight view of multimedia's relationship to journalism. Journalism practices are described by five key concepts: public service, objectivity, autonomy, immediacy, and ethics. According to Deuze, journalism ideology is enhanced and reshaped by multimedia forces.\n\nFirst of all, the ideology of public service explains the journalists' responsibility of informing the public by serving as watchdogs of the society. Gant claims that \"journalists reference the public service they perform while pursuing avenues generally closed to the public\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Christian|first=Elizabeth B.|date=2008-08-01|title=We're All Journalists Now: The Transformation of the Press and Reshaping of the Law in the Internet Age|journal=The Journal of Popular Culture|language=en|volume=41|issue=4|pages=717\u2013718|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5931.2008.00544_3.x|issn=1540-5931}}</ref> Today's multimedia ecosystem nourishes a diversity of opinions, broadening the range of public discussion. Journalists provide various platforms to increase the opportunity for popular participation, ensuring an extensive public inclusion. In doing so, citizens' voices are heard by journalists, and they can thus seek a satisfying way to serve the needs of individuals.\n\nObjectivity, the second concept, is considered as one of the most important value of journalists' professional identity.<ref name=\":7\" /> It requires journalists to be impartial, neutral, and fair.<ref name=\":7\" /> By introducing interactive communication technology, citizens are able to take part in the process of journalistic practices, whether through commenting or producing their own content. They sometimes share events happened around them as traditional journalists, reporting objectively by looking for the truth. However, some scholars argue that such trend threatens the professional value of journalists. It is hard to distinguish the trustworthiness of content in the cyber space as the participatory group is growing exponentially and becoming more diverse. The emergence of multimedia therefore can both enhance and undermine the ideology of objectivity.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite journal|last=Weinhold|first=Wendy|date=2010-08-01|title=Letters from the Editors|journal=Journalism Practice|volume=4|issue=3|pages=394\u2013404|doi=10.1080/17512781003643228|issn=1751-2786}}</ref>\n\nThirdly, autonomy refers to the independency of journalists, without interference of external forces such as governmental censorship.<ref name=\":7\" /> Multimedia journalism guarantees such autonomy as it encourages citizen's engagement. Since the Internet has become a forum for free speech, the virtual community created in cyber space is more democratic than the real life society. News content can be distributed autonomously, not having to undergo the checks of a political supervisor and regulation.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nThe fourth concept, immediacy, is another component central to the professional journalism's ideology. It means the ability of delivering news timely and completely.<ref name=\":7\" /> One of the distinctive characteristics of digital technology is its high speed of transmitting information. While news organizations are extending their distribution scope, especially the Internet, news is delivered quickly and immediately.\n\nFinally, ethics are the moral regulation, instructing journalists to \"have sense of right and wrong, or ethical, practice\".<ref name=\":7\" /> This ideology is challenged by today's news ecosystem. Even though journalists are ideally required to be unbiased and objective, acting as watchdogs to seek the truth; their personal needs and external pressure always conflict with this professional ideology. However, contemporary multimedia outlets are \"competing to win ratings\" or to gain readership by \"seeing how far they can lower the bar without getting hurt when covering celebrities\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wettenstein|first=Beverly|year=1999|title=Letters|url=|journal=Editor & Publisher|volume=|pages=21|via=}}</ref> Journalists, additionally, they want byline, position, and access to sources; they sometimes have to privilege the voice of those in power.\n\n=== Impact on labour ===\nMultimedia journalism, as an outcome of media convergence, introduces a series of changes in journalistic practices. Today's multimedia journalists creating content for newspapers, television, radio, websites, and so on. Many scholars believe that future journalists have to be familiar with different types of media.<ref name=\":4\" /> Media corporations have changed their institutional structures of their newsrooms in order to enable journalists to produce more content for various media platforms. Therefore, the boundary between journalists work for different sectors are now blurred. For example, online operations has integrated into broadcast newsroom, traditional journalists whose work emphasis is originally on writing and television reporting are now transformed to digital content.\n\nIn this context of convergent newsrooms, an increasing number of journalists are required to become multi-skilled.<ref name=\":0\" /> The common belief, \"all journalists must do all things\" becomes a built-in philosophy among news editors.<ref name=\":6\" /> Positively, many journalists regard being multi-skilled as a good trend, providing new opportunities and job possibilities for younger news workers. The capability of multi-skilling allows interns to freely transform their job field, ranging from newspaper to websites. However, such work requirement undoubtedly impose a heavy workload on journalists.<ref name=\":4\" /> Since technologies are used by the management level to increase the productivity and revenue, the work pressure is becoming a common problem among journalists.\n\nDue to the business end of media institutions, the drive for profit means the need of more content and continuity provided by journalists, which \"requires more planning, teamwork, and providing the type of depth impossible in television and print.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> It thus leads to the emergence of team-based work and collaborative journalism, challenging the traditional norm of independent journalism. Even though such trend undermines the existing modality, most scholars conclude that such \u201cnew media way\u201d of journalism has \"increased the quality of journalistic work, improved journalists' career opportunities, and enhanced their sense of do- ing a good job as a journalist. \"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Journalism]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Newsroom 1.jpg|thumb|312x312px|Newsrooms are now adapting to the multimedia journalism]]\n'''Multimedia journalism''' is the practice of contemporary [[journalism]] that distributes news content either using two or more media formats via the Internet, or disseminating news report via multiple media platforms.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Deuze|first=Mark|year=2004|title=What is multimedia journalism?|url=|journal=Journalism Studies|volume=DOI: 10.1080/ 1461670042000211131|pages=140|via=Taylor & Francis Online}}</ref> It is inseparably related to the media convergence of communication technologies, business integration of news industries, and editorial strategies of newsroom management.\n\nThis area of journalism should be distinguished from [[digital journalism]] (or online journalism), which produces news content based on the Internet to generate popular participation.\n\nContemporary multimedia journalism practice implies its profound impacts in various aspects, including content recognition, journalism ideology, labour requirements, and audience-journalists relationship.\n\n== Overview ==\nThe term multimedia journalism is used to describe the emergence of the new genre of journalistic practice.

It can refer to the combination of computing and information technology, communication networks, and digitized media content.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=New media : an introduction|last=Richard.|first=Smith|date=2014-01-01|publisher=Oxford Univ. Press|isbn=9780199005505|oclc=904363927}}</ref> Economically, convergence means the convergent products, services, and activities occurred with the development and popularization of the Internet.<ref name=\":1\" /> The inherent traits of the technology are regarded as the catalyst of a new model of journalism, multimedia journalism, which would challenge the traditional manufacture of source gathering, news reporting, and news distribution.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal|last=Doudaki|first=Vaia|last2=Spyridou|first2=Lia-Paschalia|date=2014-02-04|title=News content online: Patterns and norms under convergence dynamics|journal=Journalism|language=en|volume=16|issue=2|pages=257\u2013277|doi=10.1177/1464884913517657}}</ref>\n\nIn the news production process, newsroom convergence illustrates the degree of \"interaction and cooperation among cross-media partners\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dailey|first=Larry|last2=Demo|first2=Lori|last3=Spillman|first3=Mary|date=2005-08-01|title=The Convergence Continuum: A Model for Studying Collaboration Between Media Newsrooms|journal=Atlantic Journal of Communication|volume=13|issue=3|pages=150\u2013168|doi=10.1207/s15456889ajc1303_2|issn=1545-6870}}</ref> It can be found in the main stages of the news production process: source gathering, information aggregation, news reporting, and news distribution.  At the information-gathering level, Journalism collect sources for multiple platforms, as well as sharing stories with their counterparts. During the process of allocation and production, editors and producers decide the coverage of news stories, selecting sources from those gathered by journalists from different newsrooms. Finally, at the stage of distribution, news agencies disseminate news through various media platforms, including newspapers, websites, television, radio, and so on.\n\nFrom an industrial perspective, large news agencies today are opting for more than one form of cross-media cooperation, employing journalists for a variety of news distributing platforms, including printing, broadcasting, and online disseminating. In other words, rather than emphasizing on a single media form, contemporary  journalistic information is accessed to the audience through more than one channel. However, the practical operation of media convergence varies among different news organizations. Influential factors distinguish the shape and size of the convergence constituted by both internal practices and the external pressure. For internal factors on the one hand, an example would be the lack of consensus among the allocative and operational level, such as shareholders, editors, and publishers. External influences, on the other hand, are mostly came from the pressure of horizontal competition, political regulations, and the transformation of the news ecology.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFrom a business perspective, media convergence is regarded as a strategy for saving costs. Journalism as an industry itself, is inseparably linked with a business ends for generating high profit. Labors thus are required to proficiently produce multi-media news content with technical skills. As a result, an increase in revenue can be received when the news content is distributed efficiently through a variety of platforms.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|last=Avil\u00e9s|first=Jos\u00e9 Alberto Garc\u00eda|last2=Carvajal|first2=Miguel|date=2008-05-01|title=Integrated and Cross-Media Newsroom Convergence: Two Models of Multimedia News Production \u2014 The Cases of Novot\u00e9cnica and La Verdad Multimedia in Spain|journal=Convergence|language=en|volume=14|issue=2|pages=221\u2013239|doi=10.1177/1354856507087945|issn=1354-8565}}</ref>\n\n== Reasons for transformation ==\nMultimedia journalism is perceived as a revolutionary transformation in information and communications. It does not only challenge the traditional newsroom organization and management, but also changes the existing business model. Driving by a sheer goal of keeping corporations profitable, today's news are not primarily expected to serve as a public good. In order to generate higher profit, news agencies are producing more content accessible to an expanded size of audience through various distribution platforms. The driving force of multimedia journalism includes two ends, a \"push\" end and a \"pull\" side.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Martyn|first=Peter H.|date=2009-04-01|title=The Mojo in the Third Millennium|journal=Journalism Practice|volume=3|issue=2|pages=196\u2013215|doi=10.1080/17512780802681264|issn=1751-2786}}</ref>\n\nThe \"push\" end refers to the news providers' intention that want to migrate readers from physical printing news media to digitized platforms. The rapid growth of technology and the popularization of the Internet have fundamentally affected the business model of journalism.  Advertising as the main driving force of production, target audience can be expanded as the news content is distributed through multiple platforms. Even though physical newspapers is still maintained its prominent position in distribution, the profit from digital sales constitutes a large percentage of the revenue for the industry.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Quinn|first=Stephen|date=2004-12-01|title=An Intersection of Ideals: Journalism, Profits, Technology and Convergence|journal=Convergence|language=en|volume=10|issue=4|pages=109\u2013123|doi=10.1177/135485650401000409|issn=1354-8565}}</ref>\n\nThere is also a \"pull\" factor with respect to transformation of journalism. The emergence of digital natives who grow up with new media, speaking the digital language of computers and the Internet, make news providers adjust news formats. Young generations tend to be more proficiently engaged with new technologies, even spend their entire lives surrounded by digital media. With regards to those who are being a part of the \"digital natives\" instead of preferring traditional news coverage form, news agencies are adapting to the new environment to serve the various needs of audience.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Impacts ==\n\n=== Impact on readers ===\nNews media as the vehicle that conveys information facilitate mass communication, does not only produce and distribute news, but also enhances the relationship between news providers and readers. Traditional journalism based on single medium defines the role of readers as the recipient and the consumer of information. Journalists thus serve as gatekeepers, deciding which source to cover, and what kind of information the public need to know.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bossio|first=Diana|last2=Bebawi|first2=Saba|date=2016-11-01|title=Mapping the emergence of social media in everyday journalistic practices|journal=Media International Australia|language=en|volume=161|issue=1|pages=147\u2013158|doi=10.1177/1329878X16665494|issn=1329-878X}}</ref> News reporting through the television broadcasting, for example, is led by the reporter who is responsible for disseminating information to large audiences. However, with the development of technology, especially the Internet, the role of traditional news providers and readers are changed.\n\nEconomically, the consuming behavior of mass audience is influenced by multimedia journalism. As the consumer of information, traditional readers are passively access to information since there is only single form of news product. Today's consuming practices have changed from passive to active since audience are able to select their preferred medium from a variety of options to receive information.\n\nThe audiences' everyday practices with regards to multimedia journalism is challenging the traditional relationship between journalists and readers. Before the introduction of digital technologies, news providers have realized that they need to broaden their readership scope by providing a forum for public discussion.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Al-Rawi|first=Ahmed|date=2016-03-09|title=News values on social media: News organizations' Facebook use|journal=Journalism|volume=18|issue=7|pages=871\u2013889|language=en|doi=10.1177/1464884916636142|pmid=29278253|pmc=5732590}}</ref> Commentaries and editorial pages on newspaper are thus created for satisfying such needs; however, they are limited in size and accessibility. As news agencies are adapting to the trend of multimedia journalism, readers' voices are able to heard more comprehensively. For example, the interactive feature of new media such as the Internet, especially social media, allowing journalists to directly communicate with their audience on the one hand, also enabling readers to exchange ideas among themselves on the other hand.<ref name=\":3\" />   The emergence of interactive technology therefore undermines  the classical news agenda.  Multimedia journalism converts readers to collaborators, which generates greater contact between journalists and their audience. Audiences are able to access information via more than one platforms as well as comprehending news information in detail. In addition, multiple discussion forums provided by journalism, such as the online comment area under each news report, enabling direct communication between readers and journalists.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Becker|first=Beatriz|last2=de Castro|first2=Laura Maia|date=2014-12-01|title=Innovative writing of the twenty-first century: Multimedia journalism and education|journal=Journal of Applied Journalism & Media Studies|volume=3|issue=3|pages=335\u2013353|doi=10.1386/ajms.3.3.335_1}}</ref>\n\nToday's information culture embedded in the computer-mediated news production also leads transformation in the news habit of individuals.<ref name=\":0\" /> Firstly, the ways of how people understanding the news event and perceiving the world are shaped by images and video, no longer depending on texts. Evidently, As Stephens argues, we are now witnessing the \"rise of the image, and fall of the word\", as contemporary multimedia journalistic sphere is dominated by images, whether still or moving.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Rise of the Image, The Fall of the Word|last=Stephens|first=Mitchell|publisher=New York: Oxford University Press|year=1998|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> Secondly, users are becoming multitasking as the consumption of information in a variety of media is increasing. They tend to produce and consume news content simultaneously through different media. For example, ordinaries can read newspaper and listen to radio broadcasting at the same time.\n\n=== Impact on content ===\nIn convergent times, the scope of journalism has expanded considerably via the multimedia model, serving as an alternative form to traditional news production and consumption. Scholars believe that multimedia are used as an effective extension of the primary news  narrative format.<ref name=\":5\" /> For instance, Benson et al. claim that, with regards to news stories delivered online, even though the main narrative of news report is still the dominant part of journalism, other additional elements such as charts, images, videos are becoming more prevalent today.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Benson|first=Rodney|last2=Blach-\u00d8rsten|first2=Mark|last3=Powers|first3=Matthew|last4=Willig|first4=Ida|last5=Zambrano|first5=Sandra Vera|date=2012-02-01|title=Media Systems Online and Off: Comparing the Form of News in the United States, Denmark, and France|journal=Journal of Communication|language=en|volume=62|issue=1|pages=21\u201338|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2011.01625.x|issn=1460-2466}}</ref>\n\nContent comprehension and knowledge gain are considered as one dimension of the most significant media effects due to its socio-political characteristics.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Delli Carpini|first=Michael|year=2004|title=Mediating democratic engagement: The impact of communications on citizens' involvement in political and civic life.|url=|journal=Handbook of Political Communication Research|volume=|pages= 357\u2013394|via=}}</ref> Studies show that messages transmitted though audiovisual media can enhance emotional responses and lead to better memory. On the one hand, psychological research indicates that some \"negative emotion increase attention, interest, and learning\". When a journalistic story triggers anger, audience are more likely to remember the news report, stimulating political interest thus enhancing the quality of learning.<ref>{{Cite journal|authorlink=Nicholas Valentino|last=Valentino|first=Nicholas A.|last2=Banks|first2=Antoine J.|last3=Hutchings|first3=Vincent L.|last4=Davis|first4=Anne K.|date=2009-08-01|title=Selective Exposure in the Internet Age: The Interaction between Anxiety and Information Utility|journal=Political Psychology|language=en|volume=30|issue=4|pages=591\u2013613|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9221.2009.00716.x|issn=1467-9221}}</ref> On the other hand, compared with solely reading texts, the human brain \"absorbs larger amounts of information when the messages are audiovisual\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Graber|first=Doris A.|authorlink=Doris Graber|date=1996-07-01|title=Say it with Pictures|journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|language=en|volume=546|issue=1|pages=85\u201396|doi=10.1177/0002716296546001008|issn=0002-7162}}</ref> Information presented in multiple modalities do not only attract attention, but multimedia elements also provide readers a diverse decoding method for interpreting and comprehending meaning. As journalism content is delivered through various platforms, it has a greater opportunity to appeal to more receivers than information presented in a single channel. This \"redundancy\" of content, according to Sundar, contributing to \"cognitive rehearsal, thereby enhancing its likelihood of storage in memory\".<ref name=\"Sundar 480\u2013499\"/> Combining pictures, audio, and words in a multimedia context hence leads to better memory and comprehension of that content.\n\nMultimedia report, moreover, contributing to the contextualization of the events covered in news stories.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Becker|first=Beatriz|last2=Castro|first2=Laura Maia de|title=Innovative writing of the twenty-first century: Multimedia journalism and education|url=http://openurl.ingenta.com/content/xref?genre=article&issn=2001-0818&volume=3&issue=3&spage=335|journal=Journal of Applied Journalism & Media Studies|volume=3|issue=3|pages=335\u2013353|doi=10.1386/ajms.3.3.335_1|year=2014}}</ref> By providing real-time report through both traditional broadcasting and digital content, this form of journalistic practice offers clarifications regarding facts or systems difficult to understand. Classical model simply focuses on a single distribution platform, limiting the scope of demonstration. According to Stevens, cross-platform delivery and multimedia content provide additional information and alternative angles while reporting news stories, contributing to the complimentary of journalism.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://multimedia.journalism.berkeley.edu/tutorials/starttofinish/|title=Multimedia Storytelling: learn the secrets from experts - Berkeley Advanced Media Institute|date=2014-09-27|work=Berkeley Advanced Media Institute|access-date=2017-03-25|language=en-US}}</ref> As today's news agencies following the trend of multimedia transformation, news can be presented in a more adequate scope, whether though different media or through additional multimedia elements co-exist in a news report on the webpage. For example, in a news report published through the Internet, by posting a real-time video interview of victims of an earthquake with a chart explaining the different scales of earthquakes, can efficiently inform the public about knowledge of earthquakes.\n\n=== Impact on journalism ideology ===\nRather than simply an emergent communication technology, new media need to be understood with respect to their practical usage. Scholars such as Deuze<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=Deuze|first=Mark|year=2007|title=Media Work|url=|journal=Ecquid Novi: African Journalism Studies|volume=|pages=278|via=}}</ref> and Peters<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Peters|first=Benjamin|date=2009-02-01|title=And lead us not into thinking the new is new: a bibliographic case for new media history|journal=New Media & Society|language=en|volume=11|issue=1\u20132|pages=13\u201330|doi=10.1177/1461444808099572|issn=1461-4448}}</ref> offer an insight view of multimedia's relationship to journalism. Journalism practices are described by five key concepts: public service, objectivity, autonomy, immediacy, and ethics. According to Deuze, journalism ideology is enhanced and reshaped by multimedia forces.\n\nFirst of all, the ideology of public service explains the journalists' responsibility of informing the public by serving as watchdogs of the society. Gant claims that \"journalists reference the public service they perform while pursuing avenues generally closed to the public\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Christian|first=Elizabeth B.|date=2008-08-01|title=We're All Journalists Now: The Transformation of the Press and Reshaping of the Law in the Internet Age|journal=The Journal of Popular Culture|language=en|volume=41|issue=4|pages=717\u2013718|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5931.2008.00544_3.x|issn=1540-5931}}</ref> Today's multimedia ecosystem nourishes a diversity of opinions, broadening the range of public discussion. Journalists provide various platforms to increase the opportunity for popular participation, ensuring an extensive public inclusion. In doing so, citizens' voices are heard by journalists, and they can thus seek a satisfying way to serve the needs of individuals.\n\nObjectivity, the second concept, is considered as one of the most important value of journalists' professional identity.<ref name=\":7\" /> It requires journalists to be impartial, neutral, and fair.<ref name=\":7\" /> By introducing interactive communication technology, citizens are able to take part in the process of journalistic practices, whether through commenting or producing their own content. They sometimes share events happened around them as traditional journalists, reporting objectively by looking for the truth. However, some scholars argue that such trend threatens the professional value of journalists. It is hard to distinguish the trustworthiness of content in the cyber space as the participatory group is growing exponentially and becoming more diverse. The emergence of multimedia therefore can both enhance and undermine the ideology of objectivity.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite journal|last=Weinhold|first=Wendy|date=2010-08-01|title=Letters from the Editors|journal=Journalism Practice|volume=4|issue=3|pages=394\u2013404|doi=10.1080/17512781003643228|issn=1751-2786}}</ref>\n\nThirdly, autonomy refers to the independency of journalists, without interference of external forces such as governmental censorship.<ref name=\":7\" /> Multimedia journalism guarantees such autonomy as it encourages citizen's engagement. Since the Internet has become a forum for free speech, the virtual community created in cyber space is more democratic than the real life society. News content can be distributed autonomously, not having to undergo the checks of a political supervisor and regulation.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nThe fourth concept, immediacy, is another component central to the professional journalism's ideology. It means the ability of delivering news timely and completely.<ref name=\":7\" /> One of the distinctive characteristics of digital technology is its high speed of transmitting information. While news organizations are extending their distribution scope, especially the Internet, news is delivered quickly and immediately.\n\nFinally, ethics are the moral regulation, instructing journalists to \"have sense of right and wrong, or ethical, practice\".<ref name=\":7\" /> This ideology is challenged by today's news ecosystem. Even though journalists are ideally required to be unbiased and objective, acting as watchdogs to seek the truth; their personal needs and external pressure always conflict with this professional ideology. However, contemporary multimedia outlets are \"competing to win ratings\" or to gain readership by \"seeing how far they can lower the bar without getting hurt when covering celebrities\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wettenstein|first=Beverly|year=1999|title=Letters|url=|journal=Editor & Publisher|volume=|pages=21|via=}}</ref> Journalists, additionally, they want byline, position, and access to sources; they sometimes have to privilege the voice of those in power.\n\n=== Impact on labour ===\nMultimedia journalism, as an outcome of media convergence, introduces a series of changes in journalistic practices. Today's multimedia journalists creating content for newspapers, television, radio, websites, and so on. Many scholars believe that future journalists have to be familiar with different types of media.<ref name=\":4\" /> Media corporations have changed their institutional structures of their newsrooms in order to enable journalists to produce more content for various media platforms. Therefore, the boundary between journalists work for different sectors are now blurred. For example, online operations has integrated into broadcast newsroom, traditional journalists whose work emphasis is originally on writing and television reporting are now transformed to digital content.\n\nIn this context of convergent newsrooms, an increasing number of journalists are required to become multi-skilled.<ref name=\":0\" /> The common belief, \"all journalists must do all things\" becomes a built-in philosophy among news editors.<ref name=\":6\" /> Positively, many journalists regard being multi-skilled as a good trend, providing new opportunities and job possibilities for younger news workers. The capability of multi-skilling allows interns to freely transform their job field, ranging from newspaper to websites. However, such work requirement undoubtedly impose a heavy workload on journalists.<ref name=\":4\" /> Since technologies are used by the management level to increase the productivity and revenue, the work pressure is becoming a common problem among journalists.\n\nDue to the business end of media institutions, the drive for profit means the need of more content and continuity provided by journalists, which \"requires more planning, teamwork, and providing the type of depth impossible in television and print.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> It thus leads to the emergence of team-based work and collaborative journalism, challenging the traditional norm of independent journalism. Even though such trend undermines the existing modality, most scholars conclude that such \u201cnew media way\u201d of journalism has \"increased the quality of journalistic work, improved journalists' career opportunities, and enhanced their sense of do- ing a good job as a journalist. \"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Journalism]]\n", "name_user": "LilHelpa", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo: though\u2192through", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimedia_journalism"}
