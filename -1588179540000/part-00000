{"title_page": "Embarrassment", "text_new": "{{short description|Emotional state that is associated with mild to severe levels of discomfort}}\n{{Other uses}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{More citations needed|date=November 2012}}\n{{original research|date=June 2016}}\n}}\n{{emotion}}\n\n'''Embarrassment''' or '''awkwardness''' is an [[emotion]]al state that is associated with mild to severe levels of discomfort, and which is usually experienced when someone has a socially unacceptable or frowned-upon act or condition that was witnessed by or revealed to others.It is the same feeling AndaliteBandits feels after reading this wikipeda page because he tried to come for me. You were wrong, suck it.  \n\nUsually, some perception of loss of [[honor]] or [[dignity]] (or other high-value ideals) is involved, but the embarrassment level and the type depends on the situation. Embarrassment is similar to [[shame]] in some sense, except that shame may be experienced for an act known only to oneself.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} Also, embarrassment usually carries the connotation of being caused by an act that is merely socially unacceptable, rather than [[morality|morally]] wrong.\n\n== Causes ==\nEmbarrassment can be personal, caused by unwanted attention to private matters or personal flaws or mishaps or shyness. Some causes of embarrassment stem from personal actions, such as being caught in a lie or in making a mistake. In many cultures, being seen [[nude]] or inappropriately dressed is a particularly stressful form of embarrassment (see [[Body modesty|modesty]]). Personal embarrassment can also stem from the actions of others who place the embarrassed person in a socially awkward situation\u2014such as a parent showing one's baby pictures to friends, having someone make a derogatory comment about one's appearance or behavior, discovering one is the victim of [[gossip]], being rejected by another person (see also [[humiliation]]), being made the focus of attention (e.g., [[birthday]] celebrants, newlyweds), or even [[Vicarious embarrassment|witnessing someone else's embarrassment]].\n\nPersonal embarrassment is usually accompanied by some combination of [[blushing]], [[sweating]], [[Anxiety|nervousness]], [[stammer]]ing, and [[fidgeting]].  Sometimes the embarrassed person tries to mask embarrassment with smiles or [[nervous laughter]], especially in etiquette situations. Such a response is more common in certain cultures, which may lead to misunderstanding. There may also be feelings of [[anger]] depending on the perceived seriousness of the situation, especially if the individual thinks another person is intentionally causing the embarrassment. There is a range of responses, with the most minor being a perception of the embarrassing act as inconsequential or even [[humor]]ous, to intense apprehension or fear.\n\nThe idea that embarrassment serves an apology or appeasement function originated with Goffman who argued the embarrassed individual \"demonstrates that he/she is at least disturbed by the fact and may prove worthy at another time\".{{sfn|Goffman|1067}} Semin and Manstead demonstrated social functions of embarrassment whereby the perpetrator of knocking over a sales display (the \"bad act\") was deemed more likable by others if he/she appeared embarrassed than if he/she appeared unconcerned \u2013 regardless of restitution behavior (rebuilding the display).{{sfn|Semin|Manstead|1982}} The capacity to experience embarrassment can also be seen as functional for the group or culture. It has been demonstrated that those who are not prone to embarrassment are more likely to engage in antisocial behavior \u2013 for example, adolescent boys who displayed more embarrassment were found less likely to engage in aggressive/delinquent behaviors. Similarly, embarrassment exhibited by boys more likely to engage in aggressive/delinquent behavior was less than one-third of that exhibited by non-aggressive boys.{{sfn|Ketlner et al|1995}} Thus proneness to embarrassment (i.e., a concern for how one is evaluated by others) can act as a brake on behavior that would be dysfunctional for a group or culture.\n\n===Professional embarrassment===\nEmbarrassment can also be '''professional''' or '''official''', especially after statements expressing confidence in a stated course of action, or willful disregard for evidence.  Embarrassment increases greatly in instances involving official duties or workplace facilities, large amounts of money or materials, or loss of human life.  Examples of causes include a government's failed public policy, exposure of corrupt practices or unethical behavior, a celebrity whose personal habits receive public scrutiny or face legal action, or officials caught in serious personally embarrassing situations. Even small errors or miscalculations can lead to significantly greater official embarrassment if it is discovered that there was willful disregard for evidence or directives involved (e.g., see [[Space Shuttle Challenger]]).\n\nNot all official failures result in official embarrassment, even if the circumstances lead to some slight personal embarrassment for the people involved.  For example, losing a close political election might cause some personal embarrassment for the candidate but generally would be considered an honorable loss in the profession and thus not necessarily lead to professional embarrassment. Similarly, a scientist might be personally disappointed and embarrassed if one of his hypotheses was proven wrong, but would not normally suffer professional embarrassment as a result.  By contrast, exposure of falsified data supporting a scientific claim (e.g., see [[Hwang Woo-Suk]]) would likely lead to professional embarrassment in the scientific community.

Embarrassment is similar to [[shame]] in some sense, except that shame may be experienced for an act known only to oneself.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} Also, embarrassment usually carries the connotation of being caused by an act that is merely socially unacceptable, rather than [[morality|morally]] wrong.\n\n== Causes ==\nEmbarrassment can be personal, caused by unwanted attention to private matters or personal flaws or mishaps or shyness. Some causes of embarrassment stem from personal actions, such as being caught in a lie or in making a mistake. In many cultures, being seen [[nude]] or inappropriately dressed is a particularly stressful form of embarrassment (see [[Body modesty|modesty]]). Personal embarrassment can also stem from the actions of others who place the embarrassed person in a socially awkward situation\u2014such as a parent showing one's baby pictures to friends, having someone make a derogatory comment about one's appearance or behavior, discovering one is the victim of [[gossip]], being rejected by another person (see also [[humiliation]]), being made the focus of attention (e.g., [[birthday]] celebrants, newlyweds), or even [[Vicarious embarrassment|witnessing someone else's embarrassment]].\n\nPersonal embarrassment is usually accompanied by some combination of [[blushing]], [[sweating]], [[Anxiety|nervousness]], [[stammer]]ing, and [[fidgeting]].  Sometimes the embarrassed person tries to mask embarrassment with smiles or [[nervous laughter]], especially in etiquette situations. Such a response is more common in certain cultures, which may lead to misunderstanding. There may also be feelings of [[anger]] depending on the perceived seriousness of the situation, especially if the individual thinks another person is intentionally causing the embarrassment. There is a range of responses, with the most minor being a perception of the embarrassing act as inconsequential or even [[humor]]ous, to intense apprehension or fear.\n\nThe idea that embarrassment serves an apology or appeasement function originated with Goffman who argued the embarrassed individual \"demonstrates that he/she is at least disturbed by the fact and may prove worthy at another time\".{{sfn|Goffman|1067}} Semin and Manstead demonstrated social functions of embarrassment whereby the perpetrator of knocking over a sales display (the \"bad act\") was deemed more likable by others if he/she appeared embarrassed than if he/she appeared unconcerned \u2013 regardless of restitution behavior (rebuilding the display).{{sfn|Semin|Manstead|1982}} The capacity to experience embarrassment can also be seen as functional for the group or culture. It has been demonstrated that those who are not prone to embarrassment are more likely to engage in antisocial behavior \u2013 for example, adolescent boys who displayed more embarrassment were found less likely to engage in aggressive/delinquent behaviors. Similarly, embarrassment exhibited by boys more likely to engage in aggressive/delinquent behavior was less than one-third of that exhibited by non-aggressive boys.{{sfn|Ketlner et al|1995}} Thus proneness to embarrassment (i.e., a concern for how one is evaluated by others) can act as a brake on behavior that would be dysfunctional for a group or culture.\n\n===Professional embarrassment===\nEmbarrassment can also be '''professional''' or '''official''', especially after statements expressing confidence in a stated course of action, or willful disregard for evidence.  Embarrassment increases greatly in instances involving official duties or workplace facilities, large amounts of money or materials, or loss of human life.  Examples of causes include a government's failed public policy, exposure of corrupt practices or unethical behavior, a celebrity whose personal habits receive public scrutiny or face legal action, or officials caught in serious personally embarrassing situations. Even small errors or miscalculations can lead to significantly greater official embarrassment if it is discovered that there was willful disregard for evidence or directives involved (e.g., see [[Space Shuttle Challenger]]).\n\nNot all official failures result in official embarrassment, even if the circumstances lead to some slight personal embarrassment for the people involved.  For example, losing a close political election might cause some personal embarrassment for the candidate but generally would be considered an honorable loss in the profession and thus not necessarily lead to professional embarrassment. Similarly, a scientist might be personally disappointed and embarrassed if one of his hypotheses was proven wrong, but would not normally suffer professional embarrassment as a result.  By contrast, exposure of falsified data supporting a scientific claim (e.g., see [[Hwang Woo-Suk]]) would likely lead to professional embarrassment in the scientific community. Professional or official embarrassment is often accompanied by public expressions of [[anger]], [[denial]] of involvement, or attempts to [[Minimisation (psychology)|minimize]] the consequences.  Sometimes the embarrassed entity issues press statements, removes or distance themselves from sub-level employees, attempts to carry on as if nothing happened, suffers income loss, emigrates, or vanishes from public view.\n\n===Vicarious embarrassment===\n\n{{Main|Vicarious embarrassment}}\nVicarious embarrassment is an embarrassed feeling from observing the embarrassing actions of another person.<ref name=validation>Ahmet Uysal, G\u00fcl\u00e7in Akbas, Elif Helvac\u0131, and Irem Metin, [https://www.academia.edu/6563886/Validation_and_correlates_of_the_vicarious_embarrassment_scale Validation and correlates of the vicarious embarrassment scale], ''Personality and Individual Differences'' 60 (2014), pp. 48\u201353</ref> People who rate themselves as more empathic are more likely to experience vicarious embarrassment.<ref name=eurekalert>EurekAlert!, [https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2011-04/plos-yfa041211.php Your flaws are my pain], 13 April 2011</ref> The effect is present whether or not the observed party is aware of the embarrassing nature of their actions, although awareness generally increases the strength of the felt vicarious embarrassment, as does an accidental (as opposed to intentional) action.<ref name=flaws>S\u00f6ren Krach, Jan Christopher Cohrs, Nicole Cruz de Echeverr\u00eda Loebell, Tilo Kircher, Jens Sommer, Andreas Jansen, and Frieder Michel Paulus, [http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0018675 Your Flaws Are My Pain: Linking Empathy To Vicarious Embarrassment], PLoS ONE, 13 April 2011</ref>\n\n===Types in social psychology===\n[[File:Antoine Watteau 014.jpg|thumb|''An embarrassing proposal'' by [[Antoine Watteau]]]]\nOne typology of embarrassment is described by Sharkey and Stafford.

Both members of Force & Styles would later record cover versions of the song at later dates, the first was by The Force (Paul Hobbs and Flip & Fill) in 2003 and another was by Ultrabeat versus Darren Styles which appeared on both artists d\u00e9but albums ''[[Ultrabeat: The Album]]'' (2007) and ''[[Skydivin']] (2008).\n\n==Background==\nThe Force & Styles version of \"Paradise & Dreams\" was a [[happy hardcore]] song which first came out in 1997, on the Diverse record label.

The sport evolved from the efforts of disabled veterans in Germany and Austria during and after the [[Second World War]]. The sport is governed by the [[International Paralympic Committee]] Sports Committee. The primary equipment used includes [[outrigger]] skis, [[sit-ski]]s, and [[mono-ski]]s. Para-alpine skiing disciplines include the [[Downhill (ski competition)|Downhill]], [[Super giant slalom skiing|Super-G]], [[Giant Slalom]], [[Slalom skiing|Slalom]], [[Super Combined]] and [[Snowboarding|Snowboard]].\n\n[[Para-alpine skiing classification]] is the classification system for para-alpine skiing designed to ensure fair competition between alpine skiers with different types of disabilities. The classifications are grouped into three general disability types: standing, blind and sitting. A factoring system was created for para-alpine skiing to allow the three classification groupings to fairly compete against each other in the same race despite different functional skiing levels and medical problems.\n\nAlpine skiing was one of the foundation sports at the first [[1976 Winter Paralympics|Winter Paralympics in 1976]] with Slalom and Giant Slalom events being held. Different disciplines were added to the Paralympic programme over time. The [[2010 Winter Paralympics]] para-alpine skiing events were held at [[Whistler Creekside]]. The disciplines at Whistler included Downhill, Super-Combined, Super-G, Slalom and Giant Slalom.\n\n==History==\nSkiing as a sport for people with disabilities traces its origins back to the [[Second World War]], which produced large numbers of wounded soldiers. In Germany, Franz Wendel, an amputee who had lost a leg, successfully attached a pair of crutches to short skis. Sepp \"Peppi\" Zwicknagel, an Austrian veteran who had lost both his legs to a hand grenade, taught himself to ski and eventually became a ski instructor at [[Kitzb\u00fchel]], founded a division of the Austrian Ski Association for handicapped skiers. By 1947, annual races were being held in Austria. [[Ludwig Guttman]], a key figure in the history of paralympic sport, helped organise ski events. In the United States, [[Gretchen Fraser]] began teaching skiing to amputees in army hospitals. By the 1960s, a number of organisations had been founded. For a long time, disability skiing was restricted to amputees, but in 1969, blind skier Jean Eymere, a former ski instructor before he lost his eyesight, began a skiing program in [[Aspen, Colorado]] for blind skiers. The first international competition, the [[IPC Alpine skiing World Championship|World Disabled Alpine Championships]], was held in France in 1974.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.disaboom.com/adaptive-skiing/from-rehab-tool-to-elite-sport-a-history-of-adaptive-skiing |accessdate=12 October 2012 |title=From Rehab Tool to Elite Sport: A History of Adaptive Skiing |publisher=Disaboom }}</ref>\n\n==Events==\n===Paralympics===\n{{Main|Alpine skiing at the Winter Paralympics}}\n[[File:Ddmm88 - Innsbruck Paralympic Games M.Milton - 3b- scanned photo.jpg|thumb|Australian Paralympian Michael Milton at the 1988 Innsbruck Winter Games.|alt=Mono-skier going down a hill]]\nAlpine skiing was one of the foundation sports at the first Winter Paralympics in [[1976 Winter Paralympics|1976]] with Slalom and Giant Slalom events being held.{{sfn|Goldman|2010|p=21}}<ref name=canada90/> At the [[1984 Winter Paralympics]], the Downhill event was added to the para-alpine programme,{{sfn|Goldman|2010|p=21}} along with sit-skiing as a demonstration sport.<ref name=IPCsite/> At the [[1992 Winter Paralympics]] in [[Albertville]], Downhill, Giant and Slalom events were on the programme.<ref name=92vesjeux/> At the [[1994 Winter Paralympics]], the [[super giant slalom skiing|Super Giant Slalom]] was added to the para-alpine skiing programme.{{sfn|Goldman|2010|p=21}}{{sfn|Johnson|2009|p=12-13}} In [[1998 Winter Paralympics|1998]], para-alpine skiing classes for sitting and visually impaired skiers were added as full medal events after only having standing classes competing in previous Games.{{sfn|Goldman|2010|p=21}}<ref name=IPCsite/>\n\nAt the [[2002 Winter Paralympics]], women's Downhill and men's visually impaired Downhill were held on day 1 with men's standing and sitting Downhill taking place on day 2.

Bindings used for skis have a maximum height of {{convert|55|mm}}.<ref name=IPCsite/>\n\nSit-skis are designed for wheelchair users or other skiers with a form of paraplegia. The first sit-ski was built in 1967 by [[Josef Shrall]] from the [[Bavaria]] region of Germany. Early sit-skis used in para-alpine skiing had two wide skis, brakes, and were custom built to fit the specific skier. The weight of the ski prevented skiers from skiing moguls or steep slopes. Sit-ski development continued into the 1980s, with a more modern version demonstrated in [[Engelberg, Switzerland]] in 1987 at a workshop hosted by the [[Swiss Association of Paraplegics]]. As the technology advanced, a chair was developed that could be attached to the skis which were used by able-bodied skiers. They are now made from fibreglass and polyester, and the weight has been dramatically reduced, allowing skiers to ski on steeper slopes and compete in the moguls.{{sfn|International Paralympic Committee|2006|p=100}} Current sit-skis include seat-belts.<ref name=IPCsite/> As skis for able-bodied skiers have evolved to specialise for the event, the skis that sit-skiers use have also changed.{{sfn|International Paralympic Committee|2006|p=100}}\n\nSit-skiers use a specially designed ski called a mono-ski,{{sfn|Goldman|2010|p=22}} sometimes called a maxi mono-ski. It is used by skiers with lower limb disabilities including paralysis. A variation of the mono-ski exists for skiers with bilateral, above the knee amputations. The mono-ski was developed in Austria in the early 1980s by bilateral above-the-knee amputee [[Josef Feirsinger]] and engineer [[Horst Morokuti]]. The fundamental design they created is still the one used for mono-skis currently used in competition.{{sfn|International Paralympic Committee|2006|p=100}} The mono-ski was quickly used by German skiers who built their own at a workshop in [[T\u00fcbingen]]. The mono-ski uses the same skis used for able-bodied alpine skiing, adapted so that the skier [[:wikt:seat#Verb|sits]] on a chair attached to the ski via a spring. The mono-ski was first used at the [[1988 Winter Paralympics]].{{sfn|International Paralympic Committee|2006|p=100}}\n\nA monoski, also known as a ''sit-ski'', consists of a molded seat mounted on a metal frame. A [[shock absorber]] beneath the seat eases riding on uneven terrain and helps in turning by maximizing ski-snow contact. Modern monoskis<ref>http://www.sitski.com/pg2.htm</ref> interface with a single, ordinary [[ski#downhill ski|alpine ski]] by means of a \"ski foot,\" a metal or plastic block in the shape of a [[ski boot#Alpine|boot]] sole that clicks into the ski's [[ski bindings#Alpine|binding]]. A monoskier uses ''outriggers'' for stability; an outrigger resembles a [[crutch|forearm crutch]] with a short [[ski]] on the bottom. People new to mono-skiing are often surprised to see how much terrain is skiable in a monoski; advanced monoskiers can be found not only carving turns on groomed runs but also skiing [[mogul skiing|moguls]], [[terrain parks]], race courses, glades and even [[backcountry skiing|backcountry]] terrain\u2014in short, wherever stand-up skiers can go.\n\nAs alpine ski technology has advanced, so has monoski technology.  In North America in the 1970s and early 1980s, early \"sit-skis\" took the form of fiberglass sleds with metal runners. The first downhill sit-ski in the US, the Arroya, was invented by American [[Peter Axelson]] in 1978.<ref>[http://rideataxia.org/Articles/Ski.pdf Adaptive Skiing Resources - When the snow flies] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110826051428/http://rideataxia.org/Articles/Ski.pdf# |date=2011-08-26 }}, rideataxia.org</ref><ref>[http://www.dsusa.org/ChallMagarchive/Fall07/challmag-fall07-DSUSA40Yrs.html Remembering and celebrating 40 years of disabled sports] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112073324/http://dsusa.org/challmagarchive/fall07/challmag-fall07-dsusa40yrs.html# |date=2012-11-12 }}, dsusa.org</ref><ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/1985-03-05/news/vw-12619_1_ski-slopes/2 LA Times Article], LA Times.com</ref> Dragging very long poles or \"slicks\" in the snow were the method in which turns were actually made harder, although not effectively.  Few users became proficient enough to descend even intermediate terrain without assistance from a \"tetherer.\"  By the early '80s, Europeans were experimenting with \"ski-bobs\" that mounted on two small skis.  In place of today's minimal bucket seats were large fiberglass or Kevlar shells, and leaf springs at first were used instead of slide absorbers. The three-ski design proved accident prone, and it was soon abandoned for a single ski by most manufacturers.<ref>[http://www.asdracing.org/daten/INFO/History%20English.pdf History<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  By the middle of the decade, the technology had migrated to Canada, and on both continents the modern monoski began to emerge.

One medal event can then be held for each group even though there is a wide range of functional mobility and medical differences. The factoring system works by having a number for each class based on their functional mobility or vision levels, where the results are calculated by multiplying the finish time by the factored number. The resulting number is the one used to determine the winner in events where the factor system is used. This means the faster skier down a hill may not be the winner of an event.{{sfn|Goldman|2010|p=25}}\n\nThe factoring system is used at several para-alpine skiing competitions including the [[Alpine Cup]], [[North American Races]], [[European Cup]], [[Alpine Skiing World Cup|World Cup]] events, [[World Para Alpine Skiing Championships|World Championships]], and the [[Winter Paralympics]].{{sfn|Goldman|2010|p=25}} Disciplines use factored results to combine classes unless there are six or more skiers competing in a specific class.{{sfn|Salt Lake Organizing Committee|2002|p=13}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Sports}}\n* [[IPC Alpine Skiing World Cup]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=canada90>{{cite book|page=90|title=Winning, A celebration of Paralympic sport in Canada|publisher=Canadian Paralympic Committee|location=Ottawa, Canada|year=2011|editor-first=Anastasia|editor-last=Adani|language= en, fr }}</ref>\n<ref name=gamesexplained39>{{cite book|page=39|title=The Paralympic Games explained|first=Ian|last=Brittain|location=London|publisher=Routledge|year=2010|isbn=9780415476584|oclc=244057438}}</ref>\n<ref name=gbsite>{{cite web|url=http://www.paralympics.org.uk/sports/alpine-skiing |title=Paralympic Alpine Skiing - overview, rules and classification |publisher=British Paralympic Association |date=24 September 2012 |accessdate=8 October 2012}}</ref>\n<ref name=IPCsite>{{cite web|url=http://www.ipc-alpineskiing.org/About_the_Sport/ |title=About the Sport |publisher=International Paralympic Committee Alpine Skiing |year=2012 |accessdate=8 October 2012}}</ref>\n<ref name=canadasite>{{cite web |url=http://www.paralympic.ca/en/Sports/Winter/Alpine-Skiing.html |title=Alpine Skiing |publisher=Canadian Paralympic Committee |year=2012 |accessdate=8 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120903105135/http://www.paralympic.ca/en/Sports/Winter/Alpine-Skiing.html# |archive-date=2012-09-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n<ref name=92vesjeux>{{cite book|title=92 Ves Jeux Paralympiques : Tignes&nbsp;\u2014 Albertville|publisher=COPTA 92|location=Albertville, France|year=1992|oclc=222023213}}</ref>\n<ref name=wherehoescome>{{cite book|pages=159\u2013164|title=Paralympics : where heroes come|first1=Robert D|last1=Steadward|first2=Cynthia|last2=Peterson|location=Edmonton|publisher=One Shot Holdings Publ.

with a disability. The sport evolved from the efforts of disabled veterans in Germany and Austria during and after the [[Second World War]]. The sport is governed by the [[International Paralympic Committee]] Sports Committee. The primary equipment used includes [[outrigger]] skis, [[sit-ski]]s, and [[mono-ski]]s. Para-alpine skiing disciplines include the [[Downhill (ski competition)|Downhill]], [[Super giant slalom skiing|Super-G]], [[Giant Slalom]], [[Slalom skiing|Slalom]], [[Super Combined]] and [[Snowboarding|Snowboard]].\n\n[[Para-alpine skiing classification]] is the classification system for para-alpine skiing designed to ensure fair competition between alpine skiers with different types of disabilities. The classifications are grouped into three general disability types: standing, blind and sitting. A factoring system was created for para-alpine skiing to allow the three classification groupings to fairly compete against each other in the same race despite different functional skiing levels and medical problems.\n\nAlpine skiing was one of the foundation sports at the first [[1976 Winter Paralympics|Winter Paralympics in 1976]] with Slalom and Giant Slalom events being held. Different disciplines were added to the Paralympic programme over time. The [[2010 Winter Paralympics]] para-alpine skiing events were held at [[Whistler Creekside]]. The disciplines at Whistler included Downhill, Super-Combined, Super-G, Slalom and Giant Slalom.\n\n==History==\nSkiing as a sport for people with disabilities traces its origins back to the [[Second World War]], which produced large numbers of wounded soldiers. In Germany, Franz Wendel, an amputee who had lost a leg, successfully attached a pair of crutches to short skis. Sepp \"Peppi\" Zwicknagel, an Austrian veteran who had lost both his legs to a hand grenade, taught himself to ski and eventually became a ski instructor at [[Kitzb\u00fchel]], founded a division of the Austrian Ski Association for handicapped skiers. By 1947, annual races were being held in Austria. [[Ludwig Guttman]], a key figure in the history of paralympic sport, helped organise ski events. In the United States, [[Gretchen Fraser]] began teaching skiing to amputees in army hospitals. By the 1960s, a number of organisations had been founded. For a long time, disability skiing was restricted to amputees, but in 1969, blind skier Jean Eymere, a former ski instructor before he lost his eyesight, began a skiing program in [[Aspen, Colorado]] for blind skiers. The first international competition, the [[IPC Alpine skiing World Championship|World Disabled Alpine Championships]], was held in France in 1974.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.disaboom.com/adaptive-skiing/from-rehab-tool-to-elite-sport-a-history-of-adaptive-skiing |accessdate=12 October 2012 |title=From Rehab Tool to Elite Sport: A History of Adaptive Skiing |publisher=Disaboom }}</ref>\n\n==Events==\n===Paralympics===\n{{Main|Alpine skiing at the Winter Paralympics}}\n[[File:Ddmm88 - Innsbruck Paralympic Games M.Milton - 3b- scanned photo.jpg|thumb|Australian Paralympian Michael Milton at the 1988 Innsbruck Winter Games.|alt=Mono-skier going down a hill]]\nAlpine skiing was one of the foundation sports at the first Winter Paralympics in [[1976 Winter Paralympics|1976]] with Slalom and Giant Slalom events being held.{{sfn|Goldman|2010|p=21}}<ref name=canada90/> At the [[1984 Winter Paralympics]], the Downhill event was added to the para-alpine programme,{{sfn|Goldman|2010|p=21}} along with sit-skiing as a demonstration sport.<ref name=IPCsite/> At the [[1992 Winter Paralympics]] in [[Albertville]], Downhill, Giant and Slalom events were on the programme.<ref name=92vesjeux/> At the [[1994 Winter Paralympics]], the [[super giant slalom skiing|Super Giant Slalom]] was added to the para-alpine skiing programme.{{sfn|Goldman|2010|p=21}}{{sfn|Johnson|2009|p=12-13}} In [[1998 Winter Paralympics|1998]], para-alpine skiing classes for sitting and visually impaired skiers were added as full medal events after only having standing classes competing in previous Games.{{sfn|Goldman|2010|p=21}}<ref name=IPCsite/>\n\nAt the [[2002 Winter Paralympics]], women's Downhill and men's visually impaired Downhill were held on day 1 with men's standing and sitting Downhill taking place on day 2.

Bindings used for skis have a maximum height of {{convert|55|mm}}.<ref name=IPCsite/>\n\nSit-skis are designed for wheelchair users or other skiers with a form of paraplegia. The first sit-ski was built in 1967 by [[Josef Shrall]] from the [[Bavaria]] region of Germany. Early sit-skis used in para-alpine skiing had two wide skis, brakes, and were custom built to fit the specific skier. The weight of the ski prevented skiers from skiing moguls or steep slopes. Sit-ski development continued into the 1980s, with a more modern version demonstrated in [[Engelberg, Switzerland]] in 1987 at a workshop hosted by the [[Swiss Association of Paraplegics]]. As the technology advanced, a chair was developed that could be attached to the skis which were used by able-bodied skiers. They are now made from fibreglass and polyester, and the weight has been dramatically reduced, allowing skiers to ski on steeper slopes and compete in the moguls.{{sfn|International Paralympic Committee|2006|p=100}} Current sit-skis include seat-belts.<ref name=IPCsite/> As skis for able-bodied skiers have evolved to specialise for the event, the skis that sit-skiers use have also changed.{{sfn|International Paralympic Committee|2006|p=100}}\n\nSit-skiers use a specially designed ski called a mono-ski,{{sfn|Goldman|2010|p=22}} sometimes called a maxi mono-ski. It is used by skiers with lower limb disabilities including paralysis. A variation of the mono-ski exists for skiers with bilateral, above the knee amputations. The mono-ski was developed in Austria in the early 1980s by bilateral above-the-knee amputee [[Josef Feirsinger]] and engineer [[Horst Morokuti]]. The fundamental design they created is still the one used for mono-skis currently used in competition.{{sfn|International Paralympic Committee|2006|p=100}} The mono-ski was quickly used by German skiers who built their own at a workshop in [[T\u00fcbingen]]. The mono-ski uses the same skis used for able-bodied alpine skiing, adapted so that the skier [[:wikt:seat#Verb|sits]] on a chair attached to the ski via a spring. The mono-ski was first used at the [[1988 Winter Paralympics]].{{sfn|International Paralympic Committee|2006|p=100}}\n\nA monoski, also known as a ''sit-ski'', consists of a molded seat mounted on a metal frame. A [[shock absorber]] beneath the seat eases riding on uneven terrain and helps in turning by maximizing ski-snow contact. Modern monoskis<ref>http://www.sitski.com/pg2.htm</ref> interface with a single, ordinary [[ski#downhill ski|alpine ski]] by means of a \"ski foot,\" a metal or plastic block in the shape of a [[ski boot#Alpine|boot]] sole that clicks into the ski's [[ski bindings#Alpine|binding]]. A monoskier uses ''outriggers'' for stability; an outrigger resembles a [[crutch|forearm crutch]] with a short [[ski]] on the bottom. People new to mono-skiing are often surprised to see how much terrain is skiable in a monoski; advanced monoskiers can be found not only carving turns on groomed runs but also skiing [[mogul skiing|moguls]], [[terrain parks]], race courses, glades and even [[backcountry skiing|backcountry]] terrain\u2014in short, wherever stand-up skiers can go.\n\nAs alpine ski technology has advanced, so has monoski technology.  In North America in the 1970s and early 1980s, early \"sit-skis\" took the form of fiberglass sleds with metal runners. The first downhill sit-ski in the US, the Arroya, was invented by American [[Peter Axelson]] in 1978.<ref>[http://rideataxia.org/Articles/Ski.pdf Adaptive Skiing Resources - When the snow flies] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110826051428/http://rideataxia.org/Articles/Ski.pdf# |date=2011-08-26 }}, rideataxia.org</ref><ref>[http://www.dsusa.org/ChallMagarchive/Fall07/challmag-fall07-DSUSA40Yrs.html Remembering and celebrating 40 years of disabled sports] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112073324/http://dsusa.org/challmagarchive/fall07/challmag-fall07-dsusa40yrs.html# |date=2012-11-12 }}, dsusa.org</ref><ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/1985-03-05/news/vw-12619_1_ski-slopes/2 LA Times Article], LA Times.com</ref> Dragging very long poles or \"slicks\" in the snow were the method in which turns were actually made harder, although not effectively.  Few users became proficient enough to descend even intermediate terrain without assistance from a \"tetherer.\"  By the early '80s, Europeans were experimenting with \"ski-bobs\" that mounted on two small skis.  In place of today's minimal bucket seats were large fiberglass or Kevlar shells, and leaf springs at first were used instead of slide absorbers. The three-ski design proved accident prone, and it was soon abandoned for a single ski by most manufacturers.<ref>[http://www.asdracing.org/daten/INFO/History%20English.pdf History<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  By the middle of the decade, the technology had migrated to Canada, and on both continents the modern monoski began to emerge.

It is not open to people with intellectual disabilities.<ref name=\"HutsonSpeed2011\"/><ref name=\"Winnick2010\"/>\n\nThe first classification systems for [[Paralympic alpine skiing|para-alpine skiing]] were developed in Scandinavia, with early systems designed for skiers with amputations.{{sfn|International Paralympic Committee|2006|p=82}} At the time, equipment had yet to be developed to allow participation for skiers with spinal cord injuries.{{sfn|International Paralympic Committee|2006|p=78}} The goal of the early classification systems was to be functional but ended up being medical classification systems.{{sfn|International Paralympic Committee|2006|p=28}}{{sfn|International Paralympic Committee|2006|p=82}} At the first [[Winter Paralympics]] in 1976, there were two classifications for the sport.{{sfn|International Paralympic Committee|2006|p=82}} By the 1980s, classification existed for skiers with [[cerebral palsy]].<ref name=cpirsa-1/> At that time, with inspiration from [[wheelchair basketball classification]], efforts were made to make classification more of a functional system.{{sfn|International Paralympic Committee|2006|p=82}} Ten classes existed by the 1980s,<ref name=disabilitysport-120/> and since then, efforts have been made to improve the efficiency of classification by reducing the number of classes so fewer medals can be rewarded.<ref name=wherehoescome/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ '''Standing classes'''\n!

One medal event can then be held for each group even though there is a wide range of functional mobility and medical differences. The factoring system works by having a number for each class based on their functional mobility or vision levels, where the results are calculated by multiplying the finish time by the factored number. The resulting number is the one used to determine the winner in events where the factor system is used. This means the faster skier down a hill may not be the winner of an event.{{sfn|Goldman|2010|p=25}}\n\nThe factoring system is used at several para-alpine skiing competitions including the [[Alpine Cup]], [[North American Races]], [[European Cup]], [[Alpine Skiing World Cup|World Cup]] events, [[World Para Alpine Skiing Championships|World Championships]], and the [[Winter Paralympics]].{{sfn|Goldman|2010|p=25}} Disciplines use factored results to combine classes unless there are six or more skiers competing in a specific class.{{sfn|Salt Lake Organizing Committee|2002|p=13}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Sports}}\n* [[IPC Alpine Skiing World Cup]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=canada90>{{cite book|page=90|title=Winning, A celebration of Paralympic sport in Canada|publisher=Canadian Paralympic Committee|location=Ottawa, Canada|year=2011|editor-first=Anastasia|editor-last=Adani|language= en, fr }}</ref>\n<ref name=gamesexplained39>{{cite book|page=39|title=The Paralympic Games explained|first=Ian|last=Brittain|location=London|publisher=Routledge|year=2010|isbn=9780415476584|oclc=244057438}}</ref>\n<ref name=gbsite>{{cite web|url=http://www.paralympics.org.uk/sports/alpine-skiing |title=Paralympic Alpine Skiing - overview, rules and classification |publisher=British Paralympic Association |date=24 September 2012 |accessdate=8 October 2012}}</ref>\n<ref name=IPCsite>{{cite web|url=http://www.ipc-alpineskiing.org/About_the_Sport/ |title=About the Sport |publisher=International Paralympic Committee Alpine Skiing |year=2012 |accessdate=8 October 2012}}</ref>\n<ref name=canadasite>{{cite web |url=http://www.paralympic.ca/en/Sports/Winter/Alpine-Skiing.html |title=Alpine Skiing |publisher=Canadian Paralympic Committee |year=2012 |accessdate=8 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120903105135/http://www.paralympic.ca/en/Sports/Winter/Alpine-Skiing.html# |archive-date=2012-09-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n<ref name=92vesjeux>{{cite book|title=92 Ves Jeux Paralympiques : Tignes&nbsp;\u2014 Albertville|publisher=COPTA 92|location=Albertville, France|year=1992|oclc=222023213}}</ref>\n<ref name=wherehoescome>{{cite book|pages=159\u2013164|title=Paralympics : where heroes come|first1=Robert D|last1=Steadward|first2=Cynthia|last2=Peterson|location=Edmonton|publisher=One Shot Holdings Publ.

Intensive poaching may have already driven Cambodia's national animal, the [[kouprey]], to extinction, wild tigers to [[extirpation]], and Eld's deer, wild water buffaloes and hog deer are at critically low numbers.\n\nWildlife in Cambodia includes dholes, elephants, deer (sambar, Eld's deer, hog deer and muntjac), wild oxen (banteng and gaur), panthers, bears, and tigers. Cormorants, cranes, ibises, parrots, green peafowl, pheasants, and wild ducks are also found, and species of venomous snakes and constrictors are numerous. [[Deforestation]], mining activities, and unregulated hunting, have diminished the country\u2019s wildlife diversity rapidly.\n\nCambodia also has many endangered species, including Asian elephant, Siamese crocodile, wild water buffalo, and the Germain's silver langur.\n\nMuch work is being done in this area to help conserve and protect Cambodia's unique wildlife.

Society for Environmental Exploration 2010.</ref> Many of the species in the country, including several [[endemic]] ones, are recognized by the [[IUCN]] or World Conservation Union as threatened, endangered, or critically endangered due to [[deforestation]] and [[habitat destruction]], [[poaching]], the illegal [[wildlife trade]], and farming, fishing, and forestry concessions. Intensive poaching may have already driven Cambodia's national animal, the [[kouprey]], to extinction, wild tigers to [[extirpation]], and Eld's deer, wild water buffaloes and hog deer are at critically low numbers.\n\nWildlife in Cambodia includes dholes, elephants, deer (sambar, Eld's deer, hog deer and muntjac), wild oxen (banteng and gaur), panthers, bears, and tigers. Cormorants, cranes, ibises, parrots, green peafowl, pheasants, and wild ducks are also found, and species of venomous snakes and constrictors are numerous. [[Deforestation]], mining activities, and unregulated hunting, have diminished the country\u2019s wildlife diversity rapidly.\n\nCambodia also has many endangered species, including Asian elephant, Siamese crocodile, wild water buffalo, and the Germain's silver langur.\n\nMuch work is being done in this area to help conserve and protect Cambodia's unique wildlife. Wildlife [[conservation organizations]] operating in Cambodia include [[Conservation International]], [[World Wildlife Fund]], the [[Wildlife Conservation Society]], [[Fauna and Flora International]], [[BirdLife International]], [[Wildlife Alliance]], and many others. On 20 December 2016, 163 new animal species were reported in Southeast Asia including one known as the [[Klingon newt]] for its resemblance to a [[Klingon]] from ''[[Star Trek]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kohrong-sanloem.com/species|title=Cambodia's Islands - Species|publisher=Cambodia islands \u2013 Island Species Cambodia|date=|accessdate=December 20, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Fauna==\n[[Image:Cuon.alpinus-cut.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Dhole]]]]\n[[File:Leopard Cat Tennoji (crop).jpg|thumb|200px|[[Leopard cat]]]]\n[[Image:Siamcroc.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[Siamese crocodile]]s]]\nSome animals native to Cambodia:\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n\n===Mammals===\n{{main|List of mammals of Cambodia}}\n* [[Agile gibbon]]\n* [[Asian black bear]]\n* [[Asian elephant]]\n* [[Asian golden cat]]\n* [[Banteng]] - endangered\n* [[Binturong]] - vulnerable\n* [[Clouded leopard]]\n* [[Dhole]]\n* [[Douc langur]]\n* [[Eld's deer]]\n* [[Gaur]] - vulnerable\n* [[Hog badger]]\n* [[Hog deer]]\n* [[Indian muntjac]]\n* [[Irrawaddy dolphin]]\n* [[Kouprey]] - critical endangered\n* [[Kting voar]]\n* [[Lar gibbon]]\n* [[Leopard cat]]\n* [[Lesser false vampire bat]]\n* [[Marbled cat]]\n* [[Pileated gibbon]] - endangered\n* [[Rice-field rat]]\n* [[Sambar deer]]\n* [[Serow]]\n* [[Silvery lutung]]\n* [[Sun bear]]\n* [[Wild boar]]\n* [[Wild water buffalo]] - endangered\n\n===Reptiles===\n* [[Asiatic softshell turtle]]\n* ''[[Batagur baska]]''\n* [[Bengal monitor]]\n* [[Blood python]]\n* [[Burmese python]]\n* [[Pelochelys cantorii|Cantor's giant soft-shelled turtle]]\n* [[False gharial]]\n* [[Green sea turtle]]\n* [[Hawksbill turtle]]\n* ''[[Indotestudo elongata]]''\n* [[Leatherback sea turtle]] - vulnerable\n* ''[[Manouria emys]]''\n* ''[[Pelochelys cantorii]]''\n* ''[[Ramphotyphlops braminus]]''\n* [[Reticulated python]]\n* [[Saltwater crocodile]]\n* [[Siamese crocodile]] - [[critically endangered]]\n* [[Varanus salvator|Water monitor]]\n* [[Chrysopelea ornata|Golden flying snake]]\n* [[Ahaetulla prasina|Asian vine snake]]\n* [[Ahaetulla nasuta|Long-nosed whip snake]]\n* [[Boiga multomaculata|Many-spotted cat snake]]\n* [[Boiga dendrophila|Mangrove snake]]\n* [[Boiga cynodon|Dog-toothed cat snake]]\n* [[Boiga cyanea|Green cat snake]]\n* [[Oligodon|Kukri snakes]]\n* [[Radiated ratsnake]]\n* [[Trimeresurus albolabris|White-lipped pit viper]]\n* [[Trimeresurus macrops|Large-eyed pit viper]]\n* [[Ovophis monticola|Mountain pit viper]]\n* [[Calloselasma|Malayan pit viper]]\n* [[Daboia|Russell's viper]]\n* [[Monocled cobra]]\n* [[Indochinese spitting cobra]]\n* [[King cobra]]\n* [[Banded krait]]\n* [[Bungarus candidus|Malayan krait]]\n* [[Red-headed krait]]\n* [[Cylindrophis ruffus|Red-tailed pipe snake]]\n* [[Xenopeltis unicolor|Sunbeam snake]]\n* [[Acrochordus granulatus|Little file snake]]\n* [[Elephant trunk snake]]\n* [[Calliophis|Asian coral snakes]]\n* [[Erpeton tentaculatum|Tentacled snake]]\n* [[Hydrophis|Sea snake]]\n* [[Laticauda|Sea krait]]\n\n===Fish===\n* [[Asian arowana]]\n* ''[[Barbus]]'' sp.\n* ''[[Botia]]'' sp.\n* ''[[Channa]]'' sp.

She demonstrates a few on some of her siblings much to their annoyance. But little does Luan know that she might get pranked right back.\n# Lori Loud \u2013 With Bobby on her phone helping out from Great Lakes City and Luna providing musical accompanyment, he and Lori talk about how they first met and eventually started dating. However, they over-romanticize the details on their first date so Luan and Lynn Jr. chime in and tell them what really happened and how they had spied on them during the date to make sure that Bobby was good for Lori.\n# Lincoln Loud \u2013 Lincoln and Clyde give the listeners a virtual tour of their treehouse. When their hammock goes missing, Lincoln and Clyde become Ace Savvy and One-Eyed Jack to find out who stole it. While Lincoln suspects that it's one of his sisters, they soon discover that the culprit is someone they'd least suspect.\n# Lynn Loud Jr. \u2013 Lynn Jr. leads the listeners in her own at-home workout, arguing that gym memberships are expensive and mentioning how some gyms tend to ban people for bringing spicy submarine sandwiches into the sauna. During every single part of the workout, Lynn causes fitness-type chaos in the house which annoys her family.\n# Lana Loud \u2013 Lana teaches the listeners how to handle and take care of vehicles. She uses the family van Vanzilla as an example. Lana gets some more help from her faithful frog Hops, her parents (Lynn Sr. and Rita), and two of her sisters: Lori and Leni as they are the ones who drive Vanzilla.\n# Lucy Loud \u2013 Lucy talks about the five main features of the Royal Woods Cemetery with the help of Lincoln since Luan was unavailable. Though they soon find evidence that there is a [[ghost]] in the area.\n# Rita Loud \u2013 Rita discusses what she does at her dentist job as she runs the dental office while Dr. Feinstein is away at Cavity Con. While she does the dental work on Lola, Lori, and a reluctant Lynn Loud Sr., Rita also has to deal with some malfunctioning equipment which leads to her calling Lana in to take care of them.\n# Lisa Loud \u2013 Lisa takes a break from solving her family's problems so that she can use her brainpower to solve the greater challenges of humankind by hosting a call-in called \"Ask a Brainiac.\" Though the people who call her up are Lynn Loud Sr., Luan, Rita, Lincoln, and Lynn with their respectful questions.\n\n===Films===\n====Feature film====\nOn March 28, 2017, [[Paramount Pictures]]' president [[Marc Evans]] announced a film based on the series originally set for release on February 7, 2020 in cinemas.<ref name=\"D'Alessandro\">{{cite web|last=D'Alessandro|first=Anthony|title=Paramount Teases Its Nickelodeon-Based Feature Toon Lineup Including \u2018The Loud House\u2019 \u2013 CinemaCon|url=https://deadline.com/2017/03/spongebob-loud-house-sherlock-gnomes-1202054433/|date=March 28, 2017|website=Deadline Hollywood|accessdate=March 28, 2017}}</ref> However, in January 2019, Paramount removed the film from their schedule.<ref>{{cite web|last=Pedersen|first=Erik|title=Paramount Dates \u2018Crawl\u2019 & \u2018Playing With Fire\u2019, Moves \u2018Loud House\u2019 Off Schedule|url=https://deadline.com/2019/01/paramount-crawl-playing-with-fire-loud-house-release-dates-1202537734/|date=January 18, 2019|website=Deadline Hollywood|accessdate=January 18, 2019}}</ref> On February 5, 2019, it was announced that the film would instead be produced for release on [[Netflix]].<ref name=\"Vlessing\"/> On April 30, 2019, it was announced the film will be released sometime in 2021.

She demonstrates a few on some of her siblings much to their annoyance. But little does Luan know that she might get pranked right back.\n# Lori Loud \u2013 With Bobby on her phone helping out from Great Lakes City and Luna providing musical accompanyment, he and Lori talk about how they first met and eventually started dating. However, they over-romanticize the details on their first date so Luan and Lynn Jr. chime in and tell them what really happened and how they had spied on them during the date to make sure that Bobby was good for Lori.\n# Lincoln Loud \u2013 Lincoln and Clyde give the listeners a virtual tour of their treehouse. When their hammock goes missing, Lincoln and Clyde become Ace Savvy and One-Eyed Jack to find out who stole it. While Lincoln suspects that it's one of his sisters, they soon discover that the culprit is someone they'd least suspect.\n# Lynn Loud Jr. \u2013 Lynn Jr. leads the listeners in her own at-home workout, arguing that gym memberships are expensive and mentioning how some gyms tend to ban people for bringing spicy submarine sandwiches into the sauna. During every single part of the workout, Lynn causes fitness-type chaos in the house which annoys her family.\n# Lana Loud \u2013 Lana teaches the listeners how to handle and take care of vehicles. She uses the family van Vanzilla as an example. Lana gets some more help from her faithful frog Hops, her parents (Lynn Sr. and Rita), and two of her sisters: Lori and Leni as they are the ones who drive Vanzilla.\n# Lucy Loud \u2013 Lucy talks about the five main features of the Royal Woods Cemetery with the help of Lincoln since Luan was unavailable. Though they soon find evidence that there is a [[ghost]] in the area.\n# Rita Loud \u2013 Rita discusses what she does at her dentist job as she runs the dental office while Dr. Feinstein is away at Cavity Con. While she does the dental work on Lola, Lori, and a reluctant Lynn Loud Sr., Rita also has to deal with some malfunctioning equipment which leads to her calling Lana in to take care of them.\n# Lisa Loud \u2013 Lisa takes a break from solving her family's problems so that she can use her brainpower to solve the greater challenges of humankind by hosting a call-in called \"Ask a Brainiac.\" Though the people who call her up are Lynn Loud Sr., Luan, Rita, Lincoln, and Lynn with their respectful questions.\n\n===Films===\n====Feature film====\nOn March 28, 2017, [[Paramount Pictures]]' president [[Marc Evans]] announced a film based on the series originally set for release on February 7, 2020 in cinemas.<ref name=\"D'Alessandro\">{{cite web|last=D'Alessandro|first=Anthony|title=Paramount Teases Its Nickelodeon-Based Feature Toon Lineup Including \u2018The Loud House\u2019 \u2013 CinemaCon|url=https://deadline.com/2017/03/spongebob-loud-house-sherlock-gnomes-1202054433/|date=March 28, 2017|website=Deadline Hollywood|accessdate=March 28, 2017}}</ref> However, in January 2019, Paramount removed the film from their schedule.<ref>{{cite web|last=Pedersen|first=Erik|title=Paramount Dates \u2018Crawl\u2019 & \u2018Playing With Fire\u2019, Moves \u2018Loud House\u2019 Off Schedule|url=https://deadline.com/2019/01/paramount-crawl-playing-with-fire-loud-house-release-dates-1202537734/|date=January 18, 2019|website=Deadline Hollywood|accessdate=January 18, 2019}}</ref> On February 5, 2019, it was announced that the film would instead be produced for release on [[Netflix]].<ref name=\"Vlessing\"/> On April 30, 2019, it was announced the film will be released sometime in 2021.

He belonged to a poor family of Yathrib. He was from the tribe of Khazraj. His mother was Nasiba bint Uqba ibn Uddi.\n\n===Muhammad's era===\nJabir ibn Abdullah Ansari is said to have accepted Islam when he was about 7. Also, he is recognised as the Sahaba with the most count of hadith relating to Hajj.\n\nHis participation in the [[Battle of Badr]] is questioned by some historians; he is known to have fought in 19 battles (including Badr) under command of Muhammad and was a trusted Sahabi. He was present during the conquest of Mecca.\n\n====Battle of Uhud====\nIn the [[Battle of Uhud]], Jabir ibn Abdullah was not allowed by his father Abdullah to take part in [[Jihad]]. Jabir had seven sisters (some historians say nine) and Abdullah wanted him to take care of his family. So instead of fighting, Jabir served the thirsty soldiers. Jabir's father, Abdullah bin Amru bin Haram al-Ansari was killed in the [[Battle of Uhud]] <ref>[[Sahih Bukhari]] [http://www.sacred-texts.com/isl/bukhari/bh4/bh4_39.htm 4:40]</ref> along with his brother-in-law, Amro bin Jamooh, both having reached nearly 100 years of age.\n\n===Ali ibn Abu Talib era===\nHe fought in all the three major civil wars under Imam Ali: [[Battle of Jamal]], [[battle of Siffin|Battle of Sifeen]] and [[Battle of Nahrawan]].\n\n===Ali ibn Husayn's (ibn Ali) era (Shia doctrine)===\nJabir had a long life and became blind in his old age. According to the Shias, he devoutly waited for the time when he would meet the fifth Imam. Each morning he would come out from his house, sit by the roadside and wait for the sound of the footsteps to recognize the fifth Imam. One such day while he was waiting in the street of [[Medina]], he heard someone walking towards him, the sound of footsteps reminded him of the way Muhammad used to walk. Jabir stood up, stopped the man, and asked his name. He replied, \u201cMuhammad\u201d, Jabir asked, \u201cwhose son\u201d? He replied \u201c[[Ali ibn Husayn|Ali ibn Hussain]]\u201d. Jabir immediately recognized the man he was talking to was the 5th Imam. He kissed his hands and conveyed the message of Muhammad.\n\n===Abd al-Malik's era and Jabir\u2019s death===\nIt was during this era that he retold the [[Hadith of Umar's speech of forbidding Mut'ah]]. Jabir had a long life. He was poisoned by [[Al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf]] when he was 94, because of his loyalty to [[Ahl al-Bayt]] and was buried in [[Ctesiphon|Madain]] near [[Baghdad]] at the bank of the river [[Tigris]].
