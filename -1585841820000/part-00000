Forty Barrels and Twenty Kegs of Coca-Cola]], initiated by the government against a number of organizations, including the [[Coca-Cola Company]], in 1906 after the [[Pure Food and Drug Act]] had become law. [[Samuel Candler Dobbs]], sales manager of Coca-Cola and later its president, took up the cause of [[Truth in Advertising (organization)|truth in advertising]] in the wake of those judgments.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nIn 1909, Dobbs became president of the Associated Advertising Clubs of America, now the [[American Advertising Federation]] (AAF), and began to make speeches on the subject. In 1911, he was involved in the adoption of the \"Ten Commandments of Advertising,\" one of the first codes of advertising developed by groups of advertising firms and individual businesses. Similar organizations in succeeding decades, such as the National Better Business Commission,&nbsp;Inc. of the Associated Advertising Clubs of the World  (1921), and the National Association of Better Business Bureaus, Inc. (1933), merged to become the Association of Better Business Bureaus,&nbsp;Inc., in 1946. In 1970, the International Association of Better Business Bureaus (IABBB) was established.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\n==Structure and funding==\nThe 112 BBBs are independently governed by their own boards of directors and must meet international BBB standards, which are monitored by the IABBB. The IABBB is governed by leaders of local BBBs, as well as by senior executives from major corporations, and community leaders such as academics and legal experts. Each BBB is run separately and is chiefly funded by its accredited businesses, who often serve on its board. A study by a business school dean at [[Marquette University]] found that ninety percent of BBB board members are from business.<ref name=Parmar>{{cite news|url=http://www.smartmoney.com/investing/economy/Investigating-the-Better-Business-Bureau-23879/?page=all|title= Is the BBB Too Cozy With the Firms It Monitors?|first=Neil |last=Parmar|date=September 24, 2008|work=[[SmartMoney]]}}</ref>\n\nBusinesses that move from one BBB jurisdiction to another may need to apply for BBB accreditation in the new BBB location unless they have a system-wide accreditation. IABBB receives membership dues from BBBs, which amounted to US $4,884,226 in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dynamodata.fdncenter.org/990_pdf_archive/237/237079691/237079691_200912_990O.pdf|title=Income Tax Form 990}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>\n\n===Dispute resolution procedures===\nThe organization's dispute resolution procedures are established by the International Association of Better Business Bureaus, and implemented by local BBBs. Usually, disputes can be resolved through mediation; when appropriate, low- or no\u2011cost arbitration may also be offered and provided through the BBB.  The BBB acts as a neutral party when providing dispute resolution services.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbb.org/us/Dispute-Resolution-Services/Process/ |title=Dispute Resolution Processes and Guides \u2013 U.S. BBB |publisher=Bbb.org |accessdate=2012-03-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402220704/http://www.bbb.org/us/Dispute-Resolution-Services/Process |archive-date=2012-04-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nWhile neutrality is claimed the BBB leans very heavily toward their dues paying members. In any dispute the BBB picks the arbiter and the complainant has to agree that the decision reached by the BBB's arbiter will be the end of the dispute and no lawsuit may be brought after that.\n\nComplaints about the practice of professions like medicine and law are usually not handled by the BBB and are referred to associations regulating those professions.<ref>{{cite web|last=Roos |first=Dave |url=http://money.howstuffworks.com/better-business-bureau4.htm |title=HowStuffWorks \"File a Complaint with a BBB \" |publisher=Money.howstuffworks.com |date=2008-12-10 |accessdate=2012-03-29}}</ref> The BBB does not handle complaints that have gone to court or are in the process of going to court as the complaint is already being handled by an alternative entity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.peoples-law.org/node/901 |title=Alternatives to Going to Court &#124; The People's Law Library |publisher=Peoples-law.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-29}}</ref>\n\nIf a BBB receives a consumer dispute, the BBB contacts the business in question and offers to mediate the dispute. A business does not need to be a member of the BBB to use its mediation services. BBB accreditation, or membership, is completely optional for a business to accept and participate in through the payment of dues. Past complaints allege that the BBB compiles scores based upon their ability to collect their money from businesses, and not entirely upon business performance.<ref name=\"nbc4i1\">{{cite web |agency=Associated Press |author1=Patrick Preston |url=http://www2.nbc4i.com/news/2010/nov/19/better-business-bureau-changes-ratings-system-foll-ar-296803/ |title=Better Business Bureau Changes Ratings System Following Criticism |website=nbc4i.com |date=2010-11-19 |accessdate=2012-05-19 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130130002526/http://www2.nbc4i.com/news/2010/nov/19/better-business-bureau-changes-ratings-system-foll-ar-296803/ |archive-date=2013-01-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n====National Advertising Division====\nThe '''National Advertising Division''' of the Better Business Bureau in the United States and Canada reviews factual claims made in national advertisements.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2221968/|title=How New Is \"New\"?

with any governmental agency. Businesses that affiliate with the BBB and adhere to its standards do so through [[industry self-regulation]]. To avoid bias, the BBB's policy is to refrain from recommending or endorsing any specific business, product or service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbb.org/council/about/frequently-asked-questions/ |title=The Better Business Bureau FAQs and Information \u2013 U.S. BBB |publisher=Bbb.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-29}}</ref>\n\nThe organization has been the subject of controversy, particularly related to the allegation of giving higher ratings to businesses that pay a membership fee. The BBB disputes the claim that payment from businesses is required for them to receive an \"A\"&nbsp;rating.<ref name=\"ABC Resigned\" /> The BBB rating system relies on an A+ through F letter-grade scale. The grades represent BBB\u2019s degree of confidence that the business is operating in a trustworthy manner and will make a good faith effort to resolve any customer concerns filed with the BBB. The ratings system relies on a proprietary formula that takes into account 17 factors based on objective information and actual incidences of a business\u2019s behavior that have been verified and evaluated by BBB professionals.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbb.org/canton/get-consumer-help/rating-faq/ |title=The BBB Rating FAQ |publisher=Bbb.org |date= |accessdate=2019-09-16}}</ref>\n\nNearly 400,000 local businesses in North America are accredited by the BBB.<ref name=annual>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbb.org/council/about/annual-reports/|title=CBBB Annual Reports|publisher=BBB}}</ref> The BBB prospects successfully vetted businesses to become dues-paying 'accredited businesses' that pledge and continue to adhere to the BBB Code of Business Practices.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbb.org/council/about/vision-mission-and-values/ |title=BBB Code of Business Practices \u2013 U.S. BBB |publisher=Bbb.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-20}}</ref> In return, the BBB allows accredited businesses in good standing to use its trademarked logo in marketing materials.\n\n==History==\n{{Cleanup|section|reason=article sections needs major overhaul.

Forty Barrels and Twenty Kegs of Coca-Cola]], initiated by the government against a number of organizations, including the [[Coca-Cola Company]], in 1906 after the [[Pure Food and Drug Act]] had become law. [[Samuel Candler Dobbs]], sales manager of Coca-Cola and later its president, took up the cause of [[Truth in Advertising (organization)|truth in advertising]] in the wake of those judgments.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nIn 1909, Dobbs became president of the Associated Advertising Clubs of America, now the [[American Advertising Federation]] (AAF), and began to make speeches on the subject. In 1911, he was involved in the adoption of the \"Ten Commandments of Advertising,\" one of the first codes of advertising developed by groups of advertising firms and individual businesses. Similar organizations in succeeding decades, such as the National Better Business Commission,&nbsp;Inc. of the Associated Advertising Clubs of the World  (1921), and the National Association of Better Business Bureaus, Inc. (1933), merged to become the Association of Better Business Bureaus,&nbsp;Inc., in 1946. In 1970, the International Association of Better Business Bureaus (IABBB) was established.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\n==Structure and funding==\nThe 112 BBBs are independently governed by their own boards of directors and must meet international BBB standards, which are monitored by the IABBB. The IABBB is governed by leaders of local BBBs, as well as by senior executives from major corporations, and community leaders such as academics and legal experts. Each BBB is run separately and is chiefly funded by its accredited businesses, who often serve on its board. A study by a business school dean at [[Marquette University]] found that ninety percent of BBB board members are from business.<ref name=Parmar>{{cite news|url=http://www.smartmoney.com/investing/economy/Investigating-the-Better-Business-Bureau-23879/?page=all|title= Is the BBB Too Cozy With the Firms It Monitors?|first=Neil |last=Parmar|date=September 24, 2008|work=[[SmartMoney]]}}</ref>\n\nBusinesses that move from one BBB jurisdiction to another may need to apply for BBB accreditation in the new BBB location unless they have a system-wide accreditation. IABBB receives membership dues from BBBs, which amounted to US $4,884,226 in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dynamodata.fdncenter.org/990_pdf_archive/237/237079691/237079691_200912_990O.pdf|title=Income Tax Form 990}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>\n\n===Dispute resolution procedures===\nThe organization's dispute resolution procedures are established by the International Association of Better Business Bureaus, and implemented by local BBBs. Usually, disputes can be resolved through mediation; when appropriate, low- or no\u2011cost arbitration may also be offered and provided through the BBB.  The BBB acts as a neutral party when providing dispute resolution services.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbb.org/us/Dispute-Resolution-Services/Process/ |title=Dispute Resolution Processes and Guides \u2013 U.S. BBB |publisher=Bbb.org |accessdate=2012-03-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402220704/http://www.bbb.org/us/Dispute-Resolution-Services/Process |archive-date=2012-04-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nWhile neutrality is claimed the BBB leans very heavily toward their dues paying members. In any dispute the BBB picks the arbiter and the complainant has to agree that the decision reached by the BBB's arbiter will be the end of the dispute and no lawsuit may be brought after that.\n\nComplaints about the practice of professions like medicine and law are usually not handled by the BBB and are referred to associations regulating those professions.<ref>{{cite web|last=Roos |first=Dave |url=http://money.howstuffworks.com/better-business-bureau4.htm |title=HowStuffWorks \"File a Complaint with a BBB \" |publisher=Money.howstuffworks.com |date=2008-12-10 |accessdate=2012-03-29}}</ref> The BBB does not handle complaints that have gone to court or are in the process of going to court as the complaint is already being handled by an alternative entity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.peoples-law.org/node/901 |title=Alternatives to Going to Court &#124; The People's Law Library |publisher=Peoples-law.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-29}}</ref>\n\nIf a BBB receives a consumer dispute, the BBB contacts the business in question and offers to mediate the dispute. A business does not need to be a member of the BBB to use its mediation services. BBB accreditation, or membership, is completely optional for a business to accept and participate in through the payment of dues. Past complaints allege that the BBB compiles scores based upon their ability to collect their money from businesses, and not entirely upon business performance.<ref name=\"nbc4i1\">{{cite web |agency=Associated Press |author1=Patrick Preston |url=http://www2.nbc4i.com/news/2010/nov/19/better-business-bureau-changes-ratings-system-foll-ar-296803/ |title=Better Business Bureau Changes Ratings System Following Criticism |website=nbc4i.com |date=2010-11-19 |accessdate=2012-05-19 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130130002526/http://www2.nbc4i.com/news/2010/nov/19/better-business-bureau-changes-ratings-system-foll-ar-296803/ |archive-date=2013-01-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n====National Advertising Division====\nThe '''National Advertising Division''' of the Better Business Bureau in the United States and Canada reviews factual claims made in national advertisements.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2221968/|title=How New Is \"New\"?

Cox, President and CEO of CBBB. \"We are really one North American marketplace, and the BBB system now reflects that. Not only will it be easier for consumers to check out businesses in either country, it will be simpler for them to file a complaint or resolve a dispute.\"\n\nThe move was supported by the Canadian Council of Better Business Bureaus (CCBBB). \"Given the advances in technology and the globalization of services, it no longer makes sense to maintain two separate systems,\" said M. Jean Lemyre, chair of the CCBBB. \"The vast majority of consumers initially contact BBB through the Internet.

''Comfort'' returned on 13 October 2005 after its 7-week deployment.\n{{-}}\n\n===Partnership for the Americas (2007)===\n''USNS Comfort{{'}}s'' Partnership for the Americas humanitarian mission, which began on 15 June 2007, was a major component of the President's \"Advancing the Cause of Social Justice in the Western Hemisphere\" initiative. ''Comfort'' visited 12 Central American, South American, and Caribbean nations where its embarked medical crew provided free health care services to communities in need. The missions objective was to offer valuable training to U.S. military personnel while promoting U.S. goodwill in the region. In all, the civilian and military medical team treated more than 98,000 patients, provided 386,000 patient encounters and performed 1,100 surgeries.\nThe embarked medical crew was made up of more than 500 military and [[non-governmental organization]] (Project Hope and Operation Smile) doctors, nurses, and healthcare professionals. Their primary focus was to support medical humanitarian assistance efforts ashore. A secondary mission was outpatient shipboard health service support.\nAlso supporting ''Comfort{{'}}s'' medical mission was a [[Seabee (US Navy)|SEABEE]] detachment from the East Coast-based Mobile Construction Battalion Maintenance Unit 202, which performed civic action repair and minor construction projects in the host countries. Also on the deployment was the U.S. Navy Showband from [[Norfolk, Virginia]], which performed in each port.\n''USNS Comfort'' was operated and navigated by a crew of 68 civil service mariners (CIVMARS) from the U.S. Navy's Military Sealift Command (MSC).\nThis mission incorporated various non-government organizations and government agencies, such as Operation Smile, Project Hope, [[LDS Humanitarian Services]], the Atlanta Rotary Club, U.S. Air Force, U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Army, U.S. Health and Human Services and the Canadian Armed Forces.\nPatient encounters included a single patient receiving multiple treatments, students in training sessions, and even veterinary care services.\nDentists and staff treated 25,000 patients, extracting 300 teeth, and performing 4,000 fillings, 7,000 sealings, and 20,000 fluoride applications. In addition to treating patients, bio-medical professionals fixed about a thousand pieces of medical equipment at local health facilities. The ship's crew also delivered nearly $200,000 worth of donated humanitarian aid.\n{{-}}\n[[File:Haiti earthquake 2010 relief USNS COMFORT ako-400-20100122-web100120n1240o414.jpg|thumb|right|160px|''USNS Comfort'' off the coast of Haiti on 22 January 2010]]\n\n===Operation Unified Response (2010)===\n{{Main|2010 Haiti earthquake}}\nOn 13 January 2010, ''Comfort'' was ordered to assist in the humanitarian relief efforts following the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]] as part of [[Operation Unified Response]].<ref>{{cite web |url= https://navydads.com/forum/topics/uss-carl-vinson-and-6-other|author=Bacon, Lance M. |title=USS Carl Vinson and 6 Other Ships Head to Haiti to Provide Aid |work=Navy Times|date= 13 January 2010 |accessdate=13 January 2010}}</ref> Three days later on 16 January ''Comfort'' left the [[Port of Baltimore]] bound for [[Haiti]].
