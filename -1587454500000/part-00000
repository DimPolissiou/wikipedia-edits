Its common name is derived from [[Moreton Bay]] in [[Queensland]], Australia. It is best known for its imposing [[buttress roots]]. As ''Ficus macrophylla'' is a [[strangler fig]], seed germination usually takes place in the canopy of a [[host (biology)|host]] tree and the seedling lives as an [[epiphyte]] until its roots establish contact with the ground. It then enlarges and strangles its host, eventually becoming a freestanding tree by itself. Individuals may reach {{convert|60|m|ft|abbr=on}} in height. The large leathery, dark green leaves are {{convert|15|-|30|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} long.\n\nThe fruit is small, round and greenish, ripening and turning purple at any time of year; it is known as a [[syconium]], an inverted inflorescence with the flowers lining an internal cavity. Like all figs, it has an obligate [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]] with [[fig wasp]]s; figs are pollinated only by fig wasps, and fig wasps can reproduce only in fig flowers. Many species of bird, including pigeons, parrots and various passerines, eat the fruit. ''Ficus macrophylla'' is widely used as a feature tree in public parks and gardens in warmer climates such as California, Portugal, Italy, Spain, northern New Zealand (Auckland), and Australia. Old specimens can reach tremendous size. Its aggressive root system renders it unsuitable for all but the largest private gardens.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nSouth African botanist [[Christiaan Hendrik Persoon]] published a formal [[species description|description]] of the Moreton Bay fig in his 1807 work ''Synopsis Plantarum'',<ref>{{cite book | url=https://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/235943 | page=609 | language=Latin | first=Christiaan Hendrik | last= Persoon | title = Synopsis plantarum,seu Enchiridium botanicum, complectens enumerationem systematicam specierum hucusque cognitarum | volume=2 | year=1807 | publisher=C.F.

Female wasps enter the syconium and lay eggs in the female flowers as they mature. These eggs later hatch and the progeny mate. The females of the new generation collect pollen from the male flowers, which have matured by this point, and leave to visit other syconia and repeat the process. A field study in Brisbane found that ''F. macrophylla'' trees often bore both male and female syconia at the same time\u2014which could be beneficial for reproduction in isolated populations such as those on islands. The same study found that male phase syconia development persisted through the winter, showing that its wasp pollinator tolerated cooler weather than those of more tropical fig species.

Its common name is derived from [[Moreton Bay]] in [[Queensland]], Australia. It is best known for its imposing [[buttress roots]]. As ''Ficus macrophylla'' is a [[strangler fig]], seed germination usually takes place in the canopy of a [[host (biology)|host]] tree and the seedling lives as an [[epiphyte]] until its roots establish contact with the ground. It then enlarges and strangles its host, eventually becoming a freestanding tree by itself. Individuals may reach {{convert|60|m|ft|abbr=on}} in height. The large leathery, dark green leaves are {{convert|15|-|30|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} long.\n\nThe fruit is small, round and greenish, ripening and turning purple at any time of year; it is known as a [[syconium]], an inverted inflorescence with the flowers lining an internal cavity. Like all figs, it has an obligate [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]] with [[fig wasp]]s; figs are pollinated only by fig wasps, and fig wasps can reproduce only in fig flowers. Many species of bird, including pigeons, parrots and various passerines, eat the fruit. ''Ficus macrophylla'' is widely used as a feature tree in public parks and gardens in warmer climates such as California, Portugal, Italy, Spain, northern New Zealand (Auckland), and Australia. Old specimens can reach tremendous size.

When British rule came to an end in 1947, the subcontinent was partitioned along religious lines into two separate countries\u2014India, with a majority of Hindus, and Pakistan, with a majority of Muslims; the eastern portion of Pakistan later split off to form Bangladesh. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/India|title=India {{!}} History, Map, Population, Economy, & Facts|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>Concurrently the Muslim-majority northwest and east of [[British India]] was separated into the [[Dominion of Pakistan]], by the [[partition of India]]. The partition led to a [[population transfer]] of more than 10 million people between India and Pakistan and the death of about one million people. [[Indian National Congress]] leader [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] became the first [[Prime Minister of India]], but the leader most associated with the [[Indian independence movement|independence struggle]], [[Mahatma Gandhi]], accepted no office.

Communal violence killed an estimated one million Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs, and gravely destabilised both dominions along their [[Punjab (region)|Punjab]] and [[Bengal]] boundaries, and the cities of [[Calcutta]], [[Delhi]] and [[Lahore]]. The violence was stopped by early September owing to the co-operative efforts of both Indian and Pakistani leaders, and especially due to the efforts of [[Mohandas Gandhi]], the leader of the Indian freedom struggle, who undertook a ''fast-unto-death'' in Calcutta and later in Delhi to calm people and emphasise peace despite the threat to his life. Both governments constructed large relief camps for incoming and leaving refugees, and the [[Indian Army]] was mobilised to provide humanitarian assistance on a massive scale.\n\nThe [[assassination of Mahatma Gandhi|assassination of Mohandas Gandhi]] on 30 January 1948 was carried out by [[Nathuram Vinayak Godse]], a nationalist, who held him responsible for partition and charged that Mohandas Gandhi was appeasing Muslims. More than one million people flooded the streets of Delhi to follow the procession to cremation grounds and pay their last respects.\n\nIn 1949, India recorded almost 1 million Hindu refugees into [[West Bengal]] and other states from [[East Pakistan]], owing to communal violence, intimidation, and repression from Muslim authorities. The plight of the refugees outraged Hindus and Indian nationalists, and the refugee population drained the resources of Indian states, who were unable to absorb them. While not ruling out war, Prime Minister Nehru and Sardar Patel invited [[Liaquat Ali Khan]] for talks in Delhi. Although many Indians termed this [[appeasement]], Nehru signed a pact with Liaquat Ali Khan that pledged both nations to the protection of minorities and creation of minority commissions. Although opposed to the principle, Patel decided to back this pact for the sake of peace, and played a critical role in garnering support from West Bengal and across India, and enforcing the provisions of the pact. Khan and Nehru also signed a trade agreement, and committed to resolving bilateral disputes through peaceful means. Steadily, hundreds of thousands of Hindus returned to East Pakistan, but the thaw in relations did not last long, primarily owing to the Kashmir dispute.\n\n===Integration of princely states===\n{{Main|Political integration of India}}\n{{Infobox\n| title = [[Political integration of India]]\n| image =\n{{image array|perrow=2|width=180|height=150\n| image1 = Sardar patel (cropped).jpg|caption1=[[Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel]] as [[Minister of Home Affairs (India)|Minister for Home and States Affairs]] had the responsibility of welding the British Indian provinces and the princely states into a united India.\n| image2 = Op Polo Surrender.jpg|caption2=[[General El Edroos]] (at right) offers his surrender of the [[Hyderabad State]] Forces to Major General (later General and Army Chief) [[Joyanto Nath Chaudhuri]] at [[Secunderabad]].\n| image3 = Maharani kanchan prabhadevi.jpg|caption3=Queen [[Kanchan Prava Devi|Kanchan Prabha Devi]] of the [[Kingdom of Tripura]] signed the [[instrument of accession]] to India.

The provinces were given to India or Pakistan, in some cases in particular \u2014 [[Punjab Province (British India)|Punjab]] and [[Bengal]] \u2014 after being partitioned. The princes of the princely states, however, were given the right to either remain independent or join either dominion. Thus India's leaders were faced with the prospect of inheriting a fragmented nation with independent provinces and kingdoms dispersed across the mainland. Under the leadership of [[Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel]], the new Government of India employed political negotiations backed with the option (and, on several occasions, the use) of the military action to ensure the primacy of the central government and of the Constitution then being drafted. Sardar Patel and [[V. P. Menon]] convinced the rulers of princely states contiguous to India to accede to India. Many rights and privileges of the rulers of the princely states, especially their personal estates and privy purses, were guaranteed to convince them to accede. Some of them were made [[Rajpramukh]] (governor) and Uprajpramukh (deputy governor) of the merged states. Many small princely states were merged to form viable administrative states such as [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashra]], [[Patiala and East Punjab States Union|PEPSU]], [[Vindhya Pradesh]] and [[Madhya Bharat]]. Some princely states such as [[Tripura (princely state)|Tripura]] and [[Manipur (princely state)|Manipur]] acceded later in 1949.\n\nThere were three states that proved more difficult to integrate than others:\n# [[Junagadh]] (Hindu-majority state with a Muslim Nawab) \u2013 a December 1947 [[plebiscite]] resulted in a 99% vote<ref name=\"RJ\">{{cite book\n|last = Gandhi\n|first = Rajmohan\n|authorlink = Rajmohan Gandhi\n|year = 1991\n|title = Patel: A Life\n|publisher = Navajivan\n|location = India\n|id = ASIN B0006EYQ0A\n|page = 292\n}}</ref> to merge with India, annulling the controversial accession to Pakistan, which was made by the [[Nawab]] against the wishes of the people of the state who were overwhelmingly [[Hindu]] and despite Junagadh not being contiguous with Pakistan.\n# [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad]] (Hindu-majority state with a Muslim nizam)\u2013 Patel ordered the Indian army to depose the government of the [[Nizam]], code-named [[Operation Polo]], after the failure of negotiations, which was done between 13\u201317 September 1948. It was incorporated as a state of India the next year.\n# The area of [[Kashmir]] (Muslim-majority state with a Hindu king) in the far north of the subcontinent quickly became a source of controversy that erupted into the [[First Indo-Pakistani War]] which lasted from 1947 to 1949. Eventually, a United Nations-overseen ceasefire was agreed that left India in control of two-thirds of the contested region. [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] initially agreed to [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Mountbatten's]] proposal that a plebiscite be held in the entire state as soon as hostilities ceased, and a UN-sponsored cease-fire was agreed to by both parties on 1 Jan. 1949. No statewide plebiscite was held, however, for in 1954, after Pakistan began to receive arms from the United States, Nehru withdrew his support. The Indian Constitution came into force in Kashmir on 26 January 1950 with special clauses for the state.\n\n===Constitution===\n{{Main|Constitution of India}}\nThe [[Constituent Assembly of India|Constituent Assembly]] adopted the Constitution of India, drafted by a committee headed by Dr. [[B.

In 1974, the [[Allahabad]] High Court found Indira Gandhi guilty of misusing government machinery for election purposes. Opposition parties conducted nationwide strikes and protests demanding her immediate resignation. Various political parties united under [[Jaya Prakash Narayan]] to resist what he termed Gandhi's dictatorship. Leading strikes across India that paralysed its economy and administration, Narayan even called for the Army to oust Gandhi. In 1975, Gandhi advised President [[Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed]] to declare a [[state of emergency]] under the constitution, which allowed the central government to assume sweeping powers to defend law and order in the nation. Explaining the breakdown of law and order and threat to national security as her primary reasons, Gandhi suspended many [[civil liberties]] and postponed elections at national and state levels. Non-Congress governments in Indian states were dismissed, and nearly 1,000 opposition political leaders and activists were imprisoned and a programme of compulsory birth control introduced.<ref name=\"BBC India Profile and Timeline\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-12641776|title=India profile \u2013 Timeline|date=15 August 2018|accessdate=15 August 2018|website=Bbc.co.uk}}</ref> Strikes and public protests were outlawed in all forms.\n\nIndia's economy benefited from an end to paralysing strikes and political disorder. India announced a 20-point programme which enhanced agricultural and industrial production, increasing national growth, productivity, and job growth. But many organs of government and many Congress politicians were accused of corruption and [[authoritarian]] conduct. Police officers were accused of arresting and torturing innocent people. Indira's son and political advisor, [[Sanjay Gandhi]], was accused of committing gross excesses \u2013 Sanjay was blamed for the Health Ministry carrying out forced [[vasectomies]] of men and [[sterilization (medicine)|sterilisation]] of women as a part of the initiative to control population growth, and for the demolition of slums in [[Delhi]] near the Turkmen Gate, which left thousands of people dead and many more displaced.\n\n===Janata interlude===\n{{Main|Janata Party}}\n[[File:Morarji Desai 1978.jpg|thumb|[[Morarji Desai]], the first non-Congress Prime Minister of India, signing the \"New Delhi\" declaration during a visit by US President [[Jimmy Carter]].]]\nIndira Gandhi's Congress Party called for general elections in 1977, only to suffer a humiliating electoral defeat at the hands of the [[Janata Party]], an [[wikt:amalgamation|amalgamation]] of opposition parties.<ref>M.R.

The Government used intensive police operations to crush militant operations, but it resulted in many claims of abuse of civil liberties. Northeast India was paralysed owing to the [[ULFA]]'s clash with Government forces.\n\nOn 31 October 1984, the Prime Minister's own Sikh bodyguards assassinated her, and [[1984 anti-Sikh riots]] erupted in Delhi and parts of Punjab, causing the deaths of thousands of Sikhs along with terrible pillage, arson, and rape. Senior members of the Congress Party have been implicated in stirring the violence against Sikhs. Government investigation has failed to date to discover the causes and punish the perpetrators, but public opinion blamed Congress leaders for directing attacks on Sikhs in Delhi.\n\n===Rajiv Gandhi administration===\n[[File:STS008-44-611.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[INSAT]] system is the largest domestic communication system in the [[Asia Pacific]] Region.

Rajiv had been elected to Parliament only in 1982, and at 40, was the youngest national political leader and Prime Minister ever. But his youth and inexperience were an asset in the eyes of citizens tired of the inefficacy and corruption of career politicians, and looking for newer policies and a fresh start to resolve the country's long-standing problems. The Parliament was dissolved, and Rajiv led the Congress party to its largest majority in history (over 415 seats out of 545 possible), reaping a sympathy vote over his mother's assassination.<ref>{{cite news | work=BBC News | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/29/newsid_3314000/3314987.stm | title =  \n1984: Rajiv Gandhi wins landslide election victory | date=29 December 1984 | accessdate=1 September 2013 }}</ref>\n\nRajiv Gandhi initiated a series of reforms: the [[Licence Raj]] was loosened, and government restrictions on foreign currency, travel, foreign investment, and imports decreased considerably. This allowed private businesses to use resources and produce commercial goods without government bureaucracy interfering, and the influx of foreign investment increased India's national reserves. As Prime Minister, Rajiv broke from his mother's precedent to improve relations with the United States, which increased economic aid and scientific co-operation. Rajiv's encouragement of science and technology resulted in a major expansion of the telecommunications industry and [[Indian Space Research Organisation|India's space programme]], and gave birth to the [[software industry]] and information technology sector.<ref name=\"princeton.edu\">{{cite journal| url=http://www.princeton.edu/~reddings/pubpapers/ABRZ_AER_Sept2008.pdf| title=Unequal Effects of Liberalisation \u2013 Dismantling the License Raj in India}}</ref>\n\n[[File:BHOPAL (231583728).jpg|thumb|upright|Victims of [[Bhopal disaster]] march demanding the extradition of American [[Warren Anderson (American businessman)|Warren Anderson]] from the United States.]]\nIn December 1984, [[Bhopal disaster|gas leaked out]] at the [[Union Carbide]] pesticides plant in the central Indian city of [[Bhopal]].

The Rao administration initiated the [[privatisation]] of large, inefficient, and loss-inducing government corporations. The UF government had attempted a progressive budget that encouraged reforms, but the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]] and political instability created economic stagnation. The Vajpayee administration continued with privatisation, reduction of taxes, a sound [[fiscal policy]] aimed at reducing deficits and debts, and increased initiatives for public works.

With all political parties wishing to avoid another round of elections, a 14-party coalition led by the [[Janata Dal]] emerged to form a government known as the United Front.

The country became an independent [[nation]] within the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] on 15 August 1947. Direct administration by the British, which began in 1858, effected a political and economic unification of the subcontinent. When British rule came to an end in 1947, the subcontinent was partitioned along religious lines into two separate countries\u2014India, with a majority of Hindus, and Pakistan, with a majority of Muslims; the eastern portion of Pakistan later split off to form Bangladesh. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/India|title=India {{!}} History, Map, Population, Economy, & Facts|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>Concurrently the Muslim-majority northwest and east of [[British India]] was separated into the [[Dominion of Pakistan]], by the [[partition of India]]. The partition led to a [[population transfer]] of more than 10 million people between India and Pakistan and the death of about one million people. [[Indian National Congress]] leader [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] became the first [[Prime Minister of India]], but the leader most associated with the [[Indian independence movement|independence struggle]], [[Mahatma Gandhi]], accepted no office. [[Constitution of India|Constitution adopted in 1950]] made [[India]] a democratic country what has been sustained since then.

India has unresolved territorial disputes with [[China]] which in 1962 escalated into the [[Sino-Indian War]], and with [[Pakistan]] which resulted in wars in [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947|1947]], [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|1965]], [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|1971]] and [[Kargil War|1999]]. India was neutral in the [[Cold War]], and a leader in the [[Non-Aligned Movement]].\u00a0It had a [[Indo-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation|brief era of alliance]] with former [[Soviet Union]], when Pakistan was closely allied to the [[United States]] and [[People's Republic of China]].\n\nIndia is [[List of states with nuclear weapons|a nuclear-weapon state]], having conducted its first [[Smiling Buddha|nuclear test]] in 1974, followed by [[Pokhran-II|another five tests]] in 1998.

Communal violence killed an estimated one million Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs, and gravely destabilised both dominions along their [[Punjab (region)|Punjab]] and [[Bengal]] boundaries, and the cities of [[Calcutta]], [[Delhi]] and [[Lahore]]. The violence was stopped by early September owing to the co-operative efforts of both Indian and Pakistani leaders, and especially due to the efforts of [[Mohandas Gandhi]], the leader of the Indian freedom struggle, who undertook a ''fast-unto-death'' in Calcutta and later in Delhi to calm people and emphasise peace despite the threat to his life. Both governments constructed large relief camps for incoming and leaving refugees, and the [[Indian Army]] was mobilised to provide humanitarian assistance on a massive scale.\n\nThe [[assassination of Mahatma Gandhi|assassination of Mohandas Gandhi]] on 30 January 1948 was carried out by [[Nathuram Vinayak Godse]], a nationalist, who held him responsible for partition and charged that Mohandas Gandhi was appeasing Muslims. More than one million people flooded the streets of Delhi to follow the procession to cremation grounds and pay their last respects.\n\nIn 1949, India recorded almost 1 million Hindu refugees into [[West Bengal]] and other states from [[East Pakistan]], owing to communal violence, intimidation, and repression from Muslim authorities. The plight of the refugees outraged Hindus and Indian nationalists, and the refugee population drained the resources of Indian states, who were unable to absorb them. While not ruling out war, Prime Minister Nehru and Sardar Patel invited [[Liaquat Ali Khan]] for talks in Delhi. Although many Indians termed this [[appeasement]], Nehru signed a pact with Liaquat Ali Khan that pledged both nations to the protection of minorities and creation of minority commissions. Although opposed to the principle, Patel decided to back this pact for the sake of peace, and played a critical role in garnering support from West Bengal and across India, and enforcing the provisions of the pact. Khan and Nehru also signed a trade agreement, and committed to resolving bilateral disputes through peaceful means. Steadily, hundreds of thousands of Hindus returned to East Pakistan, but the thaw in relations did not last long, primarily owing to the Kashmir dispute.\n\n===Integration of princely states===\n{{Main|Political integration of India}}\n{{Infobox\n| title = [[Political integration of India]]\n| image =\n{{image array|perrow=2|width=180|height=150\n| image1 = Sardar patel (cropped).jpg|caption1=[[Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel]] as [[Minister of Home Affairs (India)|Minister for Home and States Affairs]] had the responsibility of welding the British Indian provinces and the princely states into a united India.\n| image2 = Op Polo Surrender.jpg|caption2=[[General El Edroos]] (at right) offers his surrender of the [[Hyderabad State]] Forces to Major General (later General and Army Chief) [[Joyanto Nath Chaudhuri]] at [[Secunderabad]].\n| image3 = Maharani kanchan prabhadevi.jpg|caption3=Queen [[Kanchan Prava Devi|Kanchan Prabha Devi]] of the [[Kingdom of Tripura]] signed the [[instrument of accession]] to India.

The provinces were given to India or Pakistan, in some cases in particular \u2014 [[Punjab Province (British India)|Punjab]] and [[Bengal]] \u2014 after being partitioned. The princes of the princely states, however, were given the right to either remain independent or join either dominion. Thus India's leaders were faced with the prospect of inheriting a fragmented nation with independent provinces and kingdoms dispersed across the mainland. Under the leadership of [[Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel]], the new Government of India employed political negotiations backed with the option (and, on several occasions, the use) of the military action to ensure the primacy of the central government and of the Constitution then being drafted. Sardar Patel and [[V. P. Menon]] convinced the rulers of princely states contiguous to India to accede to India. Many rights and privileges of the rulers of the princely states, especially their personal estates and privy purses, were guaranteed to convince them to accede. Some of them were made [[Rajpramukh]] (governor) and Uprajpramukh (deputy governor) of the merged states. Many small princely states were merged to form viable administrative states such as [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashra]], [[Patiala and East Punjab States Union|PEPSU]], [[Vindhya Pradesh]] and [[Madhya Bharat]]. Some princely states such as [[Tripura (princely state)|Tripura]] and [[Manipur (princely state)|Manipur]] acceded later in 1949.\n\nThere were three states that proved more difficult to integrate than others:\n# [[Junagadh]] (Hindu-majority state with a Muslim Nawab) \u2013 a December 1947 [[plebiscite]] resulted in a 99% vote<ref name=\"RJ\">{{cite book\n|last = Gandhi\n|first = Rajmohan\n|authorlink = Rajmohan Gandhi\n|year = 1991\n|title = Patel: A Life\n|publisher = Navajivan\n|location = India\n|id = ASIN B0006EYQ0A\n|page = 292\n}}</ref> to merge with India, annulling the controversial accession to Pakistan, which was made by the [[Nawab]] against the wishes of the people of the state who were overwhelmingly [[Hindu]] and despite Junagadh not being contiguous with Pakistan.\n# [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad]] (Hindu-majority state with a Muslim nizam)\u2013 Patel ordered the Indian army to depose the government of the [[Nizam]], code-named [[Operation Polo]], after the failure of negotiations, which was done between 13\u201317 September 1948. It was incorporated as a state of India the next year.\n# The area of [[Kashmir]] (Muslim-majority state with a Hindu king) in the far north of the subcontinent quickly became a source of controversy that erupted into the [[First Indo-Pakistani War]] which lasted from 1947 to 1949. Eventually, a United Nations-overseen ceasefire was agreed that left India in control of two-thirds of the contested region. [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] initially agreed to [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Mountbatten's]] proposal that a plebiscite be held in the entire state as soon as hostilities ceased, and a UN-sponsored cease-fire was agreed to by both parties on 1 Jan. 1949. No statewide plebiscite was held, however, for in 1954, after Pakistan began to receive arms from the United States, Nehru withdrew his support. The Indian Constitution came into force in Kashmir on 26 January 1950 with special clauses for the state.\n\n===Constitution===\n{{Main|Constitution of India}}\nThe [[Constituent Assembly of India|Constituent Assembly]] adopted the Constitution of India, drafted by a committee headed by Dr. [[B. R. Ambedkar]], on 26 November 1949. India became a sovereign democratic republic after its constitution came into effect on 26 January 1950. Dr. [[Rajendra Prasad]] became the first [[President of India]]. The three words 'socialist', 'secular' and 'integrity' were added later with the 42nd Constitution Amendment 1976.\n\n===Indo-Pakistani War of 1947\u20131948===\n{{main|Indo-Pakistani War of 1947}}\n[[File:Indian soldiers fighting in 1947 war.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Indian soldiers during the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947]].]]\nThe Indo-Pakistani War of 1947\u20131948 was fought between [[Union of India|India]] and [[Dominion of Pakistan|Pakistan]] over the [[princely state]] of [[Kashmir and Jammu (princely state)|Kashmir and Jammu]] from 1947 to 1948.

Although resisted by Desai and India's business community, the policy was popular with the masses.

In 1974, the [[Allahabad]] High Court found Indira Gandhi guilty of misusing government machinery for election purposes. Opposition parties conducted nationwide strikes and protests demanding her immediate resignation. Various political parties united under [[Jaya Prakash Narayan]] to resist what he termed Gandhi's dictatorship. Leading strikes across India that paralysed its economy and administration, Narayan even called for the Army to oust Gandhi. In 1975, Gandhi advised President [[Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed]] to declare a [[state of emergency]] under the constitution, which allowed the central government to assume sweeping powers to defend law and order in the nation. Explaining the breakdown of law and order and threat to national security as her primary reasons, Gandhi suspended many [[civil liberties]] and postponed elections at national and state levels. Non-Congress governments in Indian states were dismissed, and nearly 1,000 opposition political leaders and activists were imprisoned and a programme of compulsory birth control introduced.<ref name=\"BBC India Profile and Timeline\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-12641776|title=India profile \u2013 Timeline|date=15 August 2018|accessdate=15 August 2018|website=Bbc.co.uk}}</ref> Strikes and public protests were outlawed in all forms.\n\nIndia's economy benefited from an end to paralysing strikes and political disorder. India announced a 20-point programme which enhanced agricultural and industrial production, increasing national growth, productivity, and job growth. But many organs of government and many Congress politicians were accused of corruption and [[authoritarian]] conduct. Police officers were accused of arresting and torturing innocent people. Indira's son and political advisor, [[Sanjay Gandhi]], was accused of committing gross excesses \u2013 Sanjay was blamed for the Health Ministry carrying out forced [[vasectomies]] of men and [[sterilization (medicine)|sterilisation]] of women as a part of the initiative to control population growth, and for the demolition of slums in [[Delhi]] near the Turkmen Gate, which left thousands of people dead and many more displaced.\n\n===Janata interlude===\n{{Main|Janata Party}}\n[[File:Morarji Desai 1978.jpg|thumb|[[Morarji Desai]], the first non-Congress Prime Minister of India, signing the \"New Delhi\" declaration during a visit by US President [[Jimmy Carter]].]]\nIndira Gandhi's Congress Party called for general elections in 1977, only to suffer a humiliating electoral defeat at the hands of the [[Janata Party]], an [[wikt:amalgamation|amalgamation]] of opposition parties.<ref>M.R.

In [[Assam]], there were many incidents of communal violence between native villagers and refugees from Bangladesh, as well as settlers from other parts of India. When Indian forces, undertaking [[Operation Blue Star]], raided the hideout of self-rule pressing<ref name=\"BBC India Profile and Timeline\"/> [[Khalistan]] militants in the [[Golden Temple]] \u2014 Sikhs\u2019 most holy shrine \u2014 in [[Amritsar]], the inadvertent deaths of civilians and damage to the temple building inflamed tensions in the Sikh community across India. The Government used intensive police operations to crush militant operations, but it resulted in many claims of abuse of civil liberties. Northeast India was paralysed owing to the [[ULFA]]'s clash with Government forces.\n\nOn 31 October 1984, the Prime Minister's own Sikh bodyguards assassinated her, and [[1984 anti-Sikh riots]] erupted in Delhi and parts of Punjab, causing the deaths of thousands of Sikhs along with terrible pillage, arson, and rape. Senior members of the Congress Party have been implicated in stirring the violence against Sikhs. Government investigation has failed to date to discover the causes and punish the perpetrators, but public opinion blamed Congress leaders for directing attacks on Sikhs in Delhi.\n\n===Rajiv Gandhi administration===\n[[File:STS008-44-611.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[INSAT]] system is the largest domestic communication system in the [[Asia Pacific]] Region.

Rajiv had been elected to Parliament only in 1982, and at 40, was the youngest national political leader and Prime Minister ever. But his youth and inexperience were an asset in the eyes of citizens tired of the inefficacy and corruption of career politicians, and looking for newer policies and a fresh start to resolve the country's long-standing problems. The Parliament was dissolved, and Rajiv led the Congress party to its largest majority in history (over 415 seats out of 545 possible), reaping a sympathy vote over his mother's assassination.<ref>{{cite news | work=BBC News | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/29/newsid_3314000/3314987.stm | title =  \n1984: Rajiv Gandhi wins landslide election victory | date=29 December 1984 | accessdate=1 September 2013 }}</ref>\n\nRajiv Gandhi initiated a series of reforms: the [[Licence Raj]] was loosened, and government restrictions on foreign currency, travel, foreign investment, and imports decreased considerably. This allowed private businesses to use resources and produce commercial goods without government bureaucracy interfering, and the influx of foreign investment increased India's national reserves.

The UF government had attempted a progressive budget that encouraged reforms, but the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]] and political instability created economic stagnation. The Vajpayee administration continued with privatisation, reduction of taxes, a sound [[fiscal policy]] aimed at reducing deficits and debts, and increased initiatives for public works.

With all political parties wishing to avoid another round of elections, a 14-party coalition led by the [[Janata Dal]] emerged to form a government known as the United Front. A United Front government under former [[Chief Minister of Karnataka]] [[H.D. Deve Gowda]] lasted less than a year. The leader of the Congress Party withdrew support in March 1997. [[Inder Kumar Gujral]] replaced Deve Gowda as the consensus choice for Prime Minister of a 16-party United Front coalition.\n\nIn November 1997, the Congress Party again withdrew support for the United Front.
