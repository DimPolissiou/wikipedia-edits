An entity can be anything that is relevant to health care. It usually represents a disease or a [[pathogen]], but it can also be an isolated symptom or (developmental) anomaly of the body. There are also classes for reasons for contact with health services, social circumstances of the patient, and external causes of injury or death. The collection of all ICD-11 entities is called the '''Foundation Component'''. From this common core, various subsets can be derived; for example, the [[ICD-O]] is a derivative classification optimized for use in [[oncology]]. The primary derivative of the Foundation is called the '''ICD-11 MMS''', and it is this system that is commonly referred to as simply \"the ICD-11\".<ref name=\"Chute_(2018)\">{{Cite journal | first=Christopher G. | last=Chute | date=2018 | title=The rendering of human phenotype and rare diseases in ICD-11 | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5959961/ | journal=[[Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease]] | volume=41 | issue=3 | pages=563\u2013569 | doi=10.1007/s10545-018-0172-5 | quote=<small>The primary linearization, and the one most users will recognize and likely believe is \u201cthe ICD-11\u201d, is the Mortality and Morbidity Statistics (MMS) linearization.</small>}}</ref> MMS stands for Mortality and Morbidity Statistics. Both the [https://icd.who.int/dev11/f/en#/ Foundation Component] and the [https://icd.who.int/browse11/l-m/en ICD-11 MMS] can be viewed online on the WHO's website.\n\nThe ICD-11 will ''officially'' come into effect on 1 January 2022, at which time member nations may begin reporting morbidity and mortality statistics using the ICD-11 [[nosology]]. Each country chooses when to adopt ICD-11, and WHO has acknowledged that \"not many countries are likely to adapt that quickly\", in other words begin reporting using ICD-11 codes in 2022.<ref>{{Cite web | author=WHO | date=2018 | title=ICD-11: Classifying disease to map the way we live and die | url= https://www.who.int/health-topics/international-classification-of-diseases | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180620014204/https://www.who.int/health-topics/international-classification-of-diseases | website=www.who.int | archive-date=20 June 2018 | url-status=dead}}</ref> \n\nA group that advises the [[United States Secretary of Health and Human Services]] has given an expected implementation year of 2025, but if a clinical modification is determined to be needed (similar to the [[ICD-10-CM]]), ICD-11 implementation might not begin until 2027.<ref>{{Cite news | author=admin aapc | title=US gets the ball rolling on ICD-11 | url=https://www.aapc.com/blog/48275-us-gets-the-ball-rolling-on-icd-11/ | date=16 August 2019 | work=[[AAPC (healthcare)|AAPC]]}}</ref>\n\n==Structure==\n\n===Foundation Component and Linearizations===\nThe Foundation Component represents the entire ICD-11 universe.<ref name=\"Foundation_User_Guide\">{{Cite web | title=The ICD Foundation Component | url=https://icd.who.int/dev11/Help/Get/architecture/en | website=User Guide | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200405151626/https://icd.who.int/dev11/Help/Get/architecture/en | archive-date=5 April 2020 | url-status=live}}</ref> It is a multidimensional collection of tens of thousands of interconnected entities, also called classes or nodes.

A node can have multiple child and parent nodes.<ref>{{Cite web | author=WHO | title=1.2.5 Foundation Component and Tabular Lists of ICD\u201311 | url=https://icd.who.int/icd11refguide/en/index.html#1.2.5Foundatoncomponentandtablists%7Cfoundation-component-and-tabular-lists-of-icd11%7Cc1-2-5 | website=ICD-11 Reference Guide}}</ref> For example, [[pneumonia]] can be categorized as a [[lung infection]], but also as a [[Bacterial infection|bacterial]] or [[viral infection]] (i.e. by site or by [[etiology]]). Thus, the node Pneumonia (entity id: {{ICD11|142052508|142052508}}) has two parents: Lung infections (entity id: {{ICD11|915779102|915779102}}) and Certain infectious or parasitic diseases (entity id: {{ICD11|1435254666|1435254666}}). The Pneumonia node in turn has various children, including Bacterial pneumonia (entity id: {{ICD11|1323682030|1323682030}}) and Viral pneumonia (entity id: {{ICD11|1024154490|1024154490}}).\n\nFrom the Foundation Component, a Linearization can be derived. A Linearization is a subset of entities from the Foundation, optimized for a particular field or situation. The website of the WHO compares this to a store of books. The Foundation is the entire store, from which a therapist can make a selection that fits their profession. For instance, an [[oncologist]] will need different 'books' than an [[ophthalmologist]].<ref name=\"Foundation_User_Guide\" />\n\nAs of 2020, the website of the WHO features six officially approved ICD-11 linearizations:<ref>{{Cite web | title=Download Area | url=https://icd.who.int/dev11/downloads/ | website=icd.who.int | publisher=World Health Organization}}</ref>\n\n* The ICD-11 MMS (or simply \"the ICD-11\");\n* The [[International Classification of Primary Care|Primary Care Low Resource Setting Linearization]];\n* The [[Dermatology]] Speciality Linearization;\n* The [[Neurology]] Speciality Linearization;\n* The [[Ophthalmology]] Speciality Linearization;\n* The [[International Classification of Diseases for Oncology]] (ICD-O).\n\nThe ICD-11 is part of the [[WHO-FIC]], a family of classifications that also includes the [[International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health|ICF]] and the [[ICHI]].<ref>{{Cite web | author=WHO | title=1.1.3 ICD in the context of WHO Family of International Classifications (WHO-FIC) | url=https://icd.who.int/icd11refguide/en/index.html#1.1.3ICDandWHO-FIC&#124;icd-in-the-context-of-who-family-of-international-classifications-whofic&#124;c1-1-3 | website=icd.who.int}}</ref>\n\n===ICD-11 MMS===\n[[File:ICD-11 MMS tiny portion.png|right|thumb|250px|A tiny portion of the ICD-11 MMS, as displayed in [https://icd.who.int/browse11/l-m/en the ICD-11 Browser]. Note the gray nodes and the [[maroon]]-colored residual nodes.]]\nThe ICD-11 MMS is the primary derivative of the Foundation Component, and it is this taxonomy that is commonly referred to and recognized as \"the ICD-11\".<ref name=\"Chute_(2018)\" /> The abbreviation is variously written with or without a [[hyphen]] between 11 and MMS (\"ICD-11 MMS\" or \"ICD-11-MMS\"). MMS stands for Mortality and Morbidity Statistics.\n\nThe ICD-11 MMS takes the form of a [[hierarchy]] consisting of tens of thousands of entities. Entities can be chapters, blocks or categories. A chapter is a top level entity of the hierarchy; the MMS contains 28 of them (see [[#Chapters|Chapters]] section below). A block is used to group related categories or blocks together. A category can be anything that is relevant to health care. Every category has a unique, alphanumeric code called an ICD-11 code, or just ICD code. Chapters and blocks never have ICD-11 codes, and therefore cannot be diagnosed. An ICD-11 code is not the same as an entity id.\n\nUnlike the Foundation, all entities of a Linearization, including the MMS, must be mutually exclusive of each other and can only have a single parent.<ref name=\"Foundation_User_Guide\" /> Therefore, the hierarchy of the MMS contains gray nodes.<ref>See these screenshots: [https://archive.fo/tzqXX/d6dd919a3e1700f0f7c8ef70ef899e5ee5c826c4.png 1], [https://archive.fo/AzkYs/62fbae3bdd00a3fb409f6bba472d443663e01eae.png 2].</ref> These nodes appear as children in the hierarchy, but actually have a different parent node. They originally belong to a different block or chapter, but are also listed elsewhere because of overlap. For example, the aforementioned [[Pneumonia]] ({{ICD11|CA40}}) has two parents in the Foundation: \"Lung infections\" (location) and \"Certain infectious or parasitic diseases\" ([[etiology]]). In the MMS, Pneumonia is categorized in the \"Lung infections\", with a gray node in \"Certain infectious or parasitic diseases\". The same goes for [[injuries]], [[poisoning]]s, [[neoplasms]], and developmental anomalies, which can occur in almost any part of the body. They each have their own chapters, but their categories also have gray nodes in the chapters of the organs they affect. For instance, the [[blood cancers]], including all forms of [[leukemia]], are in the \"Neoplasms\" chapter, but they are also displayed as gray nodes in the chapter \"Diseases of the blood or blood-forming organs\".\n\nThe ICD-11 MMS also contains residual categories, or residual nodes.

This is to prevent confusion, because in many fonts, the capital letter L resembles the small letter l and the number 1 (one), and the capital letter O resembles a 0 (zero).\n\n==Changes==\nBelow is a summary of notable changes made to the ICD-11 compared to the ICD-10. One improvement of the ICD-11 MMS is a more flexible coding structure. In the ICD-10, every code starts with a letter and a two digit number (e.g. {{ICD10|P35}}). In a subcategory, this is followed by a dot and a single number (e.g. {{ICD10|P35.2}}), causing an artificial limitation of 10 subcategories per group (.0 to .9). In the ICD-11 MMS, this is resolved: after the 9, the digit continues with an A, then a B, and so on, theoretically allowing 36 subcategories (e.g. {{ICD11|KA62.A}}).<ref name=\"Reed_et_al._(2019)\">{{Cite journal | first=Geoffrey M. | last=Reed | display-authors=etal | date=2019 | title=Innovations and changes in the ICD\u201011 classification of mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders | url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wps.20611 | journal=[[World Psychiatry]] | volume=18 | issue=1 | doi=10.1002/wps.20611 | quote=<small>In the ICD\u201010, the number of groupings of disorders was artificially constrained by the decimal coding system used in the classification</small>}}</ref>\n\n===Mental disorders===\n\n====Overview====\nThe following mental disorders have been newly added to the ICD-11: [[Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder]] ({{ICD11|6B83}}), [[Binge eating disorder]] ({{ICD11|6B82}}), [[Bipolar type II disorder]] ({{ICD11|6A61}}), [[Body dysmorphic disorder]] ({{ICD11|6B21}}), [[Body integrity dysphoria]] ({{ICD11|6C21}}), [[Catatonia]] ({{ICD11|486722075|486722075}}), [[Complex post-traumatic stress disorder]] ({{ICD11|6B41}}), [[Excoriation disorder]] ({{ICD11|6B25.1}}), [[Frotteuristic disorder]] ({{ICD11|6D34}}), [[Gaming disorder]] ({{ICD11|6C51}}) [[Hoarding disorder]] ({{ICD11|6B24}}), [[Intermittent explosive disorder]] ({{ICD11|6C73}}), [[Olfactory reference disorder]] ({{ICD11|6B22}}), and [[Prolonged grief disorder]] ({{ICD11|6B42}}).<ref name=\"Reed_et_al._(2019)\" />\n\nOther notable changes include:<ref name=\"Reed_et_al._(2019)\" />\n\n* All [[personality disorders]] have been removed, and a dimensional model is used instead; see [[#Personality disorders|Personality disorders section]].\n* All subtypes of [[Schizophrenia]] (e.g. [[Paranoid schizophrenia|paranoid]], [[Disorganized schizophrenia|hebephrenic]], [[Catatonic schizophrenia|catatonic]]) have been removed. Instead, a dimensional model is used with the category Symptomatic manifestations of primary psychotic disorders ({{ICD11|6A25}}), which allows the coding for [[Positive symptoms]] ({{ICD11|6A25.0}}), [[Negative symptoms]] ({{ICD11|6A25.1}}), [[Depression (mood)|Depressive]] symptoms ({{ICD11|6A25.2}}), [[Mania|Manic]] symptoms ({{ICD11|6A25.3}}), [[:wikt:psychomotor|Psychomotor]] symptoms ({{ICD11|6A25.4}}), and [[Cognitive]] symptoms ({{ICD11|6A25.5}}).\n* [[Persistent mood disorders]] ({{ICD10|F34}}), which consists of [[Cyclothymia]] ({{ICD10|F34.0}}) and [[Dysthymia]] ({{ICD10|F34.1}}), have been deleted.\n* The ICD-10 differentiates between [[Phobic anxiety disorders]] ({{ICD10|F40}}), such as [[Agoraphobia]] ({{ICD10|F40.0}}), and Other anxiety disorders ({{ICD10|F41}}), such as [[Generalized anxiety disorder]] ({{ICD10|F41.1}}). The ICD-11 merges both groups together as [[Anxiety or fear-related disorders]] ({{ICD11|1336943699|1336943699}}).\n* All [[Pervasive developmental disorders]] ({{ICD10|F84}}) are merged into one category, [[Autism spectrum disorder]] ({{ICD11|6A02}}), except for [[Rett syndrome]], which is moved to the developmental anomalies chapter ({{ICD11|LD90.4}}).\n* [[Hyperkinetic disorders]] ({{ICD10|F90}}) is renamed [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] ({{ICD11|6A05}}), and a distinction in subtypes is made between [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder predominantly inattentive|predominantly inattentive]] ({{ICD11|6A05.0}}), predominantly hyperactive-impulsive ({{ICD11|6A05.1}}), and combined ({{ICD11|6A05.2}}). Hyperkinetic conduct disorder ({{ICD10|F90.1}}) has been removed.\n* [[Acute stress reaction]] ({{ICD10|F43.0}}) has been moved out of the mental disorder chapter, and placed in the chapter \"Factors influencing health status or contact with health services\" ({{ICD11|QE84}}).

A book of the same name was released in 1992<ref>[https://books.google.com/books/about/The_ICD_10_Classification_of_Mental_and.html?id=DFM0DgAAQBAJ Google Books entry on the CDDG]</ref> for the ICD-10, which was also known as the \"Blue Book\". It contains expanded definitions and diagnostic criteria for the mental disorders, whereas the ICD-10/-11 mental disorders chapters contain only short summaries. The ICD chapters are meant as a quick reference point, whereas the CDDG is meant for extensive diagnosing by health care professionals. To differentiate the old and the new version, the newest revision is called the ICD\u201011 CDDG. The WHO described the development of the ICD\u201011 CDDG as \"the most global, multilingual, multidisciplinary and participative revision process ever implemented for a [[classification of mental disorders]]\", involving nearly 15,000 clinicians from 155 countries.<ref name=\"Reed_et_al._(2019)\" /> As of April 2020, no release date of the ICD-11 CDDG has been given.\n\n====Personality disorders====\nThe [[personality disorder]] (PD) section has been completely revamped. All PDs have been merged into one: Personality disorder ({{ICD11|6D10}}), which can be coded as Mild ({{ICD11|6D10.0}}), Moderate ({{ICD11|6D10.1}}), Severe ({{ICD11|6D10.2}}), or severity unspecified ({{ICD11|6D10.Z}}). There is also an additional category called Personality difficulty ({{ICD11|QE50.7}}), which can be used to describe personality traits that are problematic, but do not rise to the level of a PD. Once a personality disorder or difficulty has been established, it may be specified by one or more Prominent personality traits or patterns ({{ICD11|6D11}}). The ICD-11 uses five trait domains: (1) [[Negative affectivity]] ({{ICD11|6D11.0}}); (2) Detachment ({{ICD11|6D11.1}}), (3) [[Dissociality]] ({{ICD11|6D11.2}}), (4) [[Disinhibition]] ({{ICD11|6D11.3}}), and (5) [[Anankastia]] ({{ICD11|6D11.4}}). Listed directly underneath is Borderline pattern ({{ICD11|6D11.5}}), a category similar to [[Borderline personality disorder]]. This is not a trait in itself but a combination of traits.\n\nDescribed as a clinical equivalent to the [[Big Five personality traits|Big Five model]],[chance for change] the five-trait system addresses several problems of the old category-based system. Of the ten PDs in the ICD-10, two were used with a disproportionate high frequency: [[Borderline personality disorder|Emotionally unstable personality disorder, borderline type]] ({{ICD10|F60.3}}) and [[Antisocial personality disorder|Dissocial (antisocial) personality disorder]] ({{ICD10|F60.2}}).{{ref label|a|a}} Many categories overlapped, and individuals with severe disorders often met the requirements for multiple PDs, which Reed et al. (2019) described as \"artificial [[Comorbidity#Mental health|comorbidity]]\".<ref name=\"Reed_et_al._(2019)\" /> PD was therefore reconceptualized in terms of a general dimension of severity, focusing on five negative personality traits which a person can have to various degrees.<ref name=\"Reed_(2018)\">{{Cite journal | first=Geoffrey M. | last=Reed | date=2018 | title=Progress in developing a classification of personality disorders for ICD\u201011 | url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wps.20533 | journal=World Psychiatry | volume=17 | issue=2 | pages=227-229 | doi=10.1002/wps.20533 | quote=PD was conceptualized in terms of a general dimension of severity, continuous with normal personality variation and sub\u2010threshold personality difficulty.}}</ref>\n\nThere was considerable debate regarding this new dimensional model, with many believing that categorical diagnosing should not be abandoned. In particular, there was disagreement about the status of Borderline personality disorder. Reed (2018) wrote: \"Some research suggests that borderline PD is not an independently valid category, but rather a [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity#Sociology|heterogeneous]] marker for PD severity. Other researchers view borderline PD as a valid and distinct clinical entity, and claim that 50 years of research support the validity of the category. Many \u2013 though by no means all \u2013 clinicians appear to be aligned with the latter position. In the absence of more definitive data, there seemed to be little hope of accommodating these opposing views. However, the WHO took seriously the concerns being expressed that access to services for patients with borderline PD, which has increasingly been achieved in some countries based on arguments of treatment efficacy, might be seriously undermined.\"<ref name=\"Reed_(2018)\" /> Thus, the WHO believed the inclusion of a Borderline pattern category to be a \"pragmatic compromise\".<ref name=\"Watts_(2019)\">{{Cite journal | first=Jay | last=Watts | date=2019 | title=Problems with the ICD-11 classification of personality disorder | url=https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(19)30127-0/fulltext | journal=[[The Lancet Psychiatry]] | volume=6 | issue=6 | pages=461-463 | doi=10.1016/S2215-0366(19)30127-0}}</ref>\n\nThe Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders (AMPD) included near the end of the [[DSM-5]] is similar to the PD-system of the ICD-11, although much larger and more comprehensive.<ref>[[DSM-5]], [https://books.google.nl/books?id=-JivBAAAQBAJ&lpg=PT1241&pg=PT1212#v=onepage&q&f=false pp. 761-781].</ref> It was considered for inclusion in the ICD-11, but the WHO decided against it because it was considered \"too complicated for implementation in most clinical settings around the world\",<ref name=\"Reed_(2018)\" /> since an explicit aim of the WHO was to develop a simple and efficient method that could also be used in low-resource settings.<ref name=\"Watts_(2019)\" />\n\n====Gaming disorder====\n[[Gaming disorder]] ({{ICD11|6C51}}) has been newly added to the ICD-11, and placed in the group \"Disorders due to addictive behaviours\", alongside [[Gambling disorder]] ({{ICD11|6C50}}). The latter was called Pathological gambling ({{ICD10|F63.0}}) in the ICD-10. Aside from Gaming disorder, the ICD-11 also features Hazardous gaming ({{ICD11|QE22}}), an ancillary category that can be used to identify problematic gaming which does not rise to the level of a disorder.\n\nAlthough a majority<ref name=\"Rumpf_et_al._(2018)\">{{Cite journal | first=Hans-J\u00fcrgen | last=Rumpf | display-authors=etal | date=2018 | title=Including gaming disorder in the ICD-11: The need to do so from a clinical and public health perspective | url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326427203_Including_gaming_disorder_in_the_ICD-11_The_need_to_do_so_from_a_clinical_and_public_health_perspective_Commentary_on_A_weak_scientific_basis_for_gaming_disorder_Let_us_err_on_the_side_of_caution_van_ | journal=[[Journal of Behavioral Addictions]] | volume=7 | issue=3 | pages=556-561 |doi=10.1556/2006.7.2018.59 | quote=<small>Their arguments led to a series of commentaries, most of which were in favor of including the new diagnosis of GD in the ICD-11.</small>}}</ref> of scholars supported the inclusion of Gaming disorder (GD), a significant number did not.

For example, a person can have an [[Alcoholism|alcohol dependence]] due to [[PTSD]]. In clinical practice, ''both'' disorders need to be diagnosed and treated. Rumpf et al. also warned that the lack of a GD category might jeopardize insurance reimbursement of treatments.<ref>Rumpf et al. (2018): <small>\"The argument of potential stigmatization is not speci\ufb01c to GD but relates to many other well-established mental disorders.

In response to media attention over its inclusion, the WHO emphasized that the ICD-11 does not define burn-out as a mental disorder or a disease, but as an occupational phenomenon that undermines a person's well-being in the workplace.<ref>{{Cite news | first=Megan | last=Brooks | title=Burnout Inclusion in ICD-11: Media Got It Wrong, WHO Says | url=https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/914077 | date=7 June 2019 | work=[[Medscape]] | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190821191807/https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/914077 | archive-date=21 August 2019 | url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | author=Mental Health: Evidence and Research team | title=Burn-out an \"occupational phenomenon\": International Classification of Diseases | url=https://www.who.int/mental_health/evidence/burn-out/en/ | date=28 May 2019 | website=who.int | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190529191450/https://www.who.int/mental_health/evidence/burn-out/en/ | archive-date=29 May 2019 | url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Sexual health===\nConditions related to sexual health is a new chapter in the ICD-11, incorporating sexual disorders that were previously classified as mental disorders in the ICD-10.

As such, the sexual dysfunctions that were considered \"non-organic\" were included in the mental disorder chapter, while those that were considered \"organic\" were for the most part listed in the chapter on diseases of the [[genitourinary system]]. In the ICD-11, the brain and the body are seen as an integrate whole, with sexual dysfunctions considered to involve an interaction between physical and psychological factors.<ref name=\"Reed_et_al._(2016)\">{{Cite journal | first=Geoffrey M. | last=Reed | display-authors=etal | date=2016 | title=Disorders related to sexuality and gender identity in the ICD\u201011: revising the ICD\u201010 classification based on current scientific evidence, best clinical practices, and human rights considerations | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5032510/ | \njournal=World Psychiatry | volume=15 | issue=3 | pages=205\u2013221 | doi=10.1002/wps.20354 | quote=The ICD\u201010 classification of Sexual dysfunctions (F52) is based on a Cartesian separation of \u201corganic\u201d and \u201cnon\u2010organic\u201d conditions.}}</ref><ref name=\"Reed_et_al._(2019)_separate_quote\">Reed et al.

The ICD-11 replaces these with two main categories: [[Hypoactive sexual desire dysfunction]] ({{ICD11|HA00}}) and [[Sexual arousal dysfunction]] ({{ICD11|HA01}}). The latter has two subcategories: [[Female sexual arousal dysfunction]] ({{ICD11|HA01.0}}) and [[Male erectile dysfunction]] ({{ICD11|HA01.1}}). The difference between Hypoactive sexual desire dysfunction and Sexual arousal dysfunction is that in the former, there is a reduced or absent desire for sexual activity. In the latter, there is insufficient physical and emotional response to sexual activity, even though there still is a ''desire'' to engage in satisfying sex. The WHO acknowledged that there is an overlap between desire and arousal, but they are not the same. Management should focus on their distinct features. Furthermore, while there is no \"Male sexual arousal dysfunction\", the WHO has emphasized that Sexual arousal dysfunction can applied to both men and women, with female sexual dysfunction and male erectile problems being (sub)classified separately.<ref>Reed et al. (2016): <small>\"[T]he proposed ICD\u201011 category Hypoactive sexual desire dysfunction can be applied to both men and women, while Female sexual arousal dysfunction is classified separately. (\u2026) Although there is significant comorbidity between desire and arousal dysfunction, the overlap of these conditions does not mean that they are one and the same; research suggests that management should be targeted toward their distinct features.\"</small></ref>\n\nThe ICD-10 contains the categories [[Vaginismus]] ({{ICD10|N94.2}}), Nonorganic vaginismus ({{ICD10|F52.5}}), [[Dyspareunia]] ({{ICD10|N94.1}}), and Nonorganic dyspareunia ({{ICD10|F52.6}}). As the WHO aimed to steer away from the aforementioned \"outdated mind/body split\", the organic and nonorganic disorders were merged. Vaginismus has been reclassified as [[Sexual pain\u2010penetration disorder]] ({{ICD11|HA20}}). Dyspareunia ({{ICD11|GA12}}) has been retained. A related condition is [[Vulvodynia]], which is in the ICD-9 ({{ICD9|625.7}}), but not in the ICD-10. It has been re-added to the ICD-11 ({{ICD11|GA34.02}}).<ref name=\"Reed_et_al._(2016)\" />\n\nSexual dysfunctions and Sexual pain\u2010penetration disorder can be coded alongside a temporal qualifier, \"lifelong\" or \"acquired\", and a situational qualifier, \"general\" or \"situational\". Furthermore, the ICD-11 offers five aetiological qualifiers, or \"Associated with\u2026\" categories, to further specify the diagnosis.<ref name=\"Reed_et_al._(2016)\" /> For example, a woman who experiences sexual problems [[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor#Sexual dysfunction|due to adverse effects of an SSRI antidepressant]] may be diagnosed with \"Female sexual arousal dysfunction, acquired, generalised\" ({{ICD11|HA01.02}}) combined with \"Associated with use of psychoactive substance or medication\" ({{ICD11|HA40.2}}).\n\n====Compulsive sexual behaviour disorder====\n[[Excessive sexual drive]] ({{ICD10|F52.7}}) from the ICD-10 has been reclassified as [[Compulsive sexual behaviour disorder]] (CSBD, {{ICD11|6C72}}) and listed under Impulse control disorders. The WHO was unwilling to overpathologize sexual behaviour, stating that having a high [[Libido|sexual drive]] is not necessarily a disorder, so long as these people do not exhibit impaired control over their behavior, significant distress, or impairment in functioning.<ref name=\"Kraus_et_al._(2018)\">{{Cite journal | first=Shane W. | last=Kraus | display-authors=etal | date=2018 | title=Compulsive sexual behaviour disorder in the ICD\u201011 | url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wps.20499 | journal=World Psychiatry | volume=17 | issue=1 | pages=109-110 | doi=10.1002/wps.20499}}</ref> Kraus et al.

Experiencing shame and guilt about sex is not a reliable indicator of a sex disorder, Kraus stated.<ref name=\"Kraus_et_al._(2018)\" />\n\nThere was debate on whether CSBD should be considered a (behavioral) addiction. It has been claimed that [[neuroimaging]] shows overlap between compulsive sexual behavior and substance-use disorder through common [[neurotransmitter]] systems.<ref>{{Cite journal | first1=Shane W. | last1=Kraus | first2=Valerie | last2=Voon | first3=Marc N. | last3=Potenza | date=2016 | title=Should compulsive sexual behavior be considered an addiction? | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4990495/ | journal=[[Addiction (journal)|Addiction]] | volume=111 | issue=12 | pages=2097\u20132106 | doi=10.1111/add.13297}}</ref> Nonetheless, it was ultimately decided to place the disorder in the Impulse control disorders group. Kraus et al. wrote that, for the ICD-11, \"a relatively conservative position has been recommended, recognizing that we do not yet have definitive information on whether the processes involved in the development and maintenance of the disorder [CSBD] are equivalent to those observed in substance use disorders, gambling and gaming\".<ref name=\"Kraus_et_al._(2018)\" />\n\n====Paraphilic disorders====\n[[Paraphilic disorders]], called Disorders of sexual preference in the ICD-10, have remained in the mental disorders chapter, although they have gray nodes in the sexual health chapter. The ICD-10 categories [[Fetishism]] ({{ICD10|F65.0}}) and [[Fetishistic transvestism]] ({{ICD10|F65.1}}) were removed because, if they don't cause distress or harm, they are not considered mental disorders. [[Frotteuristic disorder]] ({{ICD11|6D34}}) has been newly added.<ref name=\"Reed_et_al._(2016)\" />\n\n====Gender incongruence====\n[[Transgenderism]] and [[gender dysphoria]] are called Gender incongruence in the ICD-11. In the ICD-10, the group Gender identity disorders ({{ICD10|F64}}) consisted of three main categories: [[Transsexualism]] ({{ICD10|F64.0}}), [[Dual-role transvestism]] ({{ICD10|F64.1}}), and [[Gender identity disorder of childhood]] ({{ICD10|F64.2}}). In the ICD-11, Dual-role transvestism was deleted due to a lack of public health or clinical relevance.<ref name=\"Reed_et_al._(2016)\" /> Transsexualism was renamed Gender incongruence of adolescence or adulthood ({{ICD11|HA60}}), and Gender identity disorder of childhood was renamed Gender incongruence of childhood ({{ICD11|HA61}}).\n\nIn the ICD-10, the Gender identity disorders were placed in the mental disorders chapter, following what was customary at the time. Throughout the 20st century, both the ICD and the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]] approached transgenderism from a psychopathological position, as transgenderism presents a discrepancy between someone's biologically assigned sex and the sex they perceive to have. Since this causes mental distress, it was consequently considered a mental disorder, with distress or discomfort being a core diagnostic feature.<ref>{{Cite journal | first1=Jack | last1=Drescher | first2=Peggy | last2=Cohen-Kettenis | first3=Sam | last3=Winter | date=2012 | title=Minding the body: Situating gender identity diagnoses in the ICD-11 | journal=[[International Review of Psychiatry]] | volume=24 | issue=6 | pages=568\u2013577 | doi=10.3109/09540261.2012.741575 | quote=<small>Until the middle of the 20th century, with rare exceptions, transgender presentations were usually classified as psychopathological.</small>}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | first1=Peggy T | last1=Cohen-Kettenis | first2=Friedemann | last2=Pf\u00e4fflin | title=The DSM Diagnostic Criteria for Gender Identity Disorder in Adolescents and Adults | url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38019925_The_DSM_Diagnostic_Criteria_for_Gender_Identity_Disorder_in_Adolescents_and_Adults | journal=[[Archives of Sexual Behavior]] | volume=39 | issue=2 | doi=10.1007/s10508-009-9562-y | quote=<small>The DSM has consistently approached gender problems from the position that a divergence between the assigned sex or \u201cthe\u201d physical sex (assuming that \u201cphysical sex\u201d is a one-dimensional construct) and \u201cthe\u201d psychological sex (gender) per se signals a psychiatric disorder.

Since an official ICD code is usually needed to gain access and reimbursement for therapy, the WHO found it ill-advised to remove transgenderism from the ICD-11 all together.

An entity can be anything that is relevant to health care. It usually represents a disease or a [[pathogen]], but it can also be an isolated symptom or (developmental) anomaly of the body. There are also classes for reasons for contact with health services, social circumstances of the patient, and external causes of injury or death. The collection of all ICD-11 entities is called the '''Foundation Component'''. From this common core, various subsets can be derived; for example, the [[ICD-O]] is a derivative classification optimized for use in [[oncology]]. The primary derivative of the Foundation is called the '''ICD-11 MMS''', and it is this system that is commonly referred to as simply \"the ICD-11\".<ref name=\"Chute_(2018)\">{{Cite journal | first=Christopher G. | last=Chute | date=2018 | title=The rendering of human phenotype and rare diseases in ICD-11 | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5959961/ | journal=[[Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease]] | volume=41 | issue=3 | pages=563\u2013569 | doi=10.1007/s10545-018-0172-5 | quote=<small>The primary linearization, and the one most users will recognize and likely believe is \u201cthe ICD-11\u201d, is the Mortality and Morbidity Statistics (MMS) linearization.</small>}}</ref> MMS stands for Mortality and Morbidity Statistics.

Thus, the node Pneumonia (entity id: {{ICD11|142052508|142052508}}) has two parents: Lung infections (entity id: {{ICD11|915779102|915779102}}) and Certain infectious or parasitic diseases (entity id: {{ICD11|1435254666|1435254666}}). The Pneumonia node in turn has various children, including Bacterial pneumonia (entity id: {{ICD11|1323682030|1323682030}}) and Viral pneumonia (entity id: {{ICD11|1024154490|1024154490}}).\n\nFrom the Foundation Component, a Linearization can be derived. A Linearization is a subset of entities from the Foundation, optimized for a particular field or situation. The website of the WHO compares this to a store of books. The Foundation is the entire store, from which a therapist can make a selection that fits their profession. For instance, an [[oncologist]] will need different 'books' than an [[ophthalmologist]].<ref name=\"Foundation_User_Guide\" />\n\nAs of 2020, the website of the WHO features six officially approved ICD-11 linearizations:<ref>{{Cite web | title=Download Area | url=https://icd.who.int/dev11/downloads/ | website=icd.who.int | publisher=World Health Organization}}</ref>\n\n* The ICD-11 MMS (or simply \"the ICD-11\");\n* The [[International Classification of Primary Care|Primary Care Low Resource Setting Linearization]];\n* The [[Dermatology]] Speciality Linearization;\n* The [[Neurology]] Speciality Linearization;\n* The [[Ophthalmology]] Speciality Linearization;\n* The [[International Classification of Diseases for Oncology]] (ICD-O).\n\nThe ICD-11 is part of the [[WHO-FIC]], a family of classifications that also includes the [[ICF]] and the [[ICHI]].<ref>{{Cite web | author=WHO | title=1.1.3 ICD in the context of WHO Family of International Classifications (WHO-FIC) | url=https://icd.who.int/icd11refguide/en/index.html#1.1.3ICDandWHO-FIC&#124;icd-in-the-context-of-who-family-of-international-classifications-whofic&#124;c1-1-3 | website=icd.who.int}}</ref>\n\n===ICD-11 MMS===\n[[File:ICD-11 MMS tiny portion.png|right|thumb|250px|A tiny portion of the ICD-11 MMS, as displayed in [https://icd.who.int/browse11/l-m/en the ICD-11 Browser]. Note the gray nodes and the [[maroon]]-colored residual nodes.]]\nThe ICD-11 MMS is the primary derivative of the Foundation Component, and it is this taxonomy that is commonly referred to and recognized as \"the ICD-11\".<ref name=\"Chute_(2018)\" /> The abbreviation is variously written with or without a [[hyphen]] between 11 and MMS (\"ICD-11 MMS\" or \"ICD-11-MMS\"). MMS stands for Mortality and Morbidity Statistics.\n\nThe ICD-11 MMS takes the form of a [[hierarchy]] consisting of tens of thousands of entities. Entities can be chapters, blocks or categories. A chapter is a top level entity of the hierarchy; the MMS contains 28 of them (see [[#Chapters|Chapters]] section below). A block is used to group related categories or blocks together. A category can be anything that is relevant to health care. Every category has a unique, alphanumeric code called an ICD-11 code, or just ICD code. Chapters and blocks never have ICD-11 codes, and therefore cannot be diagnosed. An ICD-11 code is not the same as an entity id.\n\nUnlike the Foundation, all entities of a Linearization, including the MMS, must be mutually exclusive of each other and can only have a single parent.<ref name=\"Foundation_User_Guide\" /> Therefore, the hierarchy of the MMS contains gray nodes.<ref>See these screenshots: [https://archive.fo/tzqXX/d6dd919a3e1700f0f7c8ef70ef899e5ee5c826c4.png 1], [https://archive.fo/AzkYs/62fbae3bdd00a3fb409f6bba472d443663e01eae.png 2].</ref> These nodes appear as children in the hierarchy, but actually have a different parent node. They originally belong to a different block or chapter, but are also listed elsewhere because of overlap. For example, the aforementioned [[Pneumonia]] ({{ICD11|CA40}}) has two parents in the Foundation: \"Lung infections\" (location) and \"Certain infectious or parasitic diseases\" ([[etiology]]). In the MMS, Pneumonia is categorized in the \"Lung infections\", with a gray node in \"Certain infectious or parasitic diseases\". The same goes for [[injuries]], [[poisonings]], [[neoplasms]], and developmental anomalies, which can occur in almost any part of the body. They each have their own chapters, but their categories also have gray nodes in the chapters of the organs they affect. For instance, the [[blood cancers]], including all forms of [[leukemia]], are in the \"Neoplasms\" chapter, but they are also displayed as gray nodes in the chapter \"Diseases of the blood or blood-forming organs\".\n\nThe ICD-11 MMS also contains residual categories, or residual nodes. These are the 'Other specified' and 'Unspecified' categories, miscellaneous classes which can be used to code conditions that do not fit with any of the more specific MMS entities.<ref>{{Cite web | author=WHO | title=2.3.3 Residual categories \u2013 \u2018Other\u2019 and \u2018Unspecified\u2019 | url=https://icd.who.int/icd11refguide/en/index.html#2.03CodeAlso%7Cresidual-categories-other-and-unspecified%7Cc2-3-3 | website=ICD-11 Reference Guide}}</ref> In the ICD-11 Browser, residual nodes are displayed in a [[maroon]] color.<ref>[[Talk:ICD-11#Residual nodes are maroon-colored]]</ref> Residual categories are not in the Foundation, and therefore are the only classes with derivative entity ids: their ids are the same as their parent nodes, with \"/mms/otherspecified\" or \"/mms/unspecified\" tagged at the end. Their ICD codes always end with Y for 'Other specified' categories, or Z for 'Unspecified' categories (e.g. {{ICD11|1C4Y}} and {{ICD11|1C4Z}}).\n\n==Chapters==\nBelow is a list of all chapters of the ICD-11 MMS, the primary linearization of the Foundation Component.\n\n{| \n| {{ordered list|\n| [[ICD-11 MMS Chapter 1: Certain infectious or parasitic diseases|'''1A00\u20131H0Z''' &nbsp;Certain infectious or parasitic diseases]]\n| '''2A00\u20132F9Z''' &nbsp;Neoplasms\n| '''3A00\u20133C0Z''' &nbsp;Diseases of the blood or blood-forming organs\n| '''4A00\u20134B4Z''' &nbsp;Diseases of the immune system\n| '''5A00\u20135D46''' &nbsp;Endocrine, nutritional or metabolic diseases\n| '''6A00\u20136E8Z''' &nbsp;Mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmental disorders\n| '''7A00\u20137B2Z''' &nbsp;Sleep-wake disorders\n| '''8A00\u20138E7Z''' &nbsp;Diseases of the nervous system\n| '''9A00\u20139E1Z''' &nbsp;Diseases of the visual system\n| '''AA00\u2013AC0Z''' &nbsp;Diseases of the ear or mastoid process\n| '''BA00\u2013BE2Z''' &nbsp;Diseases of the circulatory system\n| '''CA00\u2013CB7Z''' &nbsp;Diseases of the respiratory system\n| '''DA00\u2013DE2Z''' &nbsp;Diseases of the digestive system\n| '''EA00\u2013EM0Z''' &nbsp;Diseases of the skin\n}}\n| {{ordered list|start=15\n| '''FA00\u2013FC0Z''' &nbsp;Diseases of the musculoskeletal system or connective tissue\n| '''GA00\u2013GC8Z''' &nbsp;Diseases of the genitourinary system\n| '''HA00\u2013HA8Z''' &nbsp;Conditions related to sexual health\n| '''JA00\u2013JB6Z''' &nbsp;Pregnancy, childbirth or the puerperium\n| '''KA00\u2013KD5Z''' &nbsp;Certain conditions originating in the perinatal period\n| '''LA00\u2013LD9Z''' &nbsp;Developmental anomalies\n| '''MA00\u2013MH2Y''' &nbsp;Symptoms, signs or clinical findings, not elsewhere classified\n| '''NA00\u2013NF2Z''' &nbsp;Injury, poisoning or certain other consequences of external causes\n| '''PA00\u2013PL2Z''' &nbsp;External causes of morbidity or mortality\n| '''QA00\u2013QF4Z''' &nbsp;Factors influencing health status or contact with health services\n| '''RA00\u2013RA26''' &nbsp;Codes for special purposes\n| '''SA00\u2013SJ3Z''' &nbsp;Supplementary Chapter Traditional Medicine Conditions - Module I\n| '''VA00\u2013VC50''' &nbsp;Supplementary section for functioning assessment\n| '''X...\u2013X...''' &nbsp;Extension Codes\n}}\n|}\n\nUnlike the [[ICD-10]], the ICD-11 MMS features no codes beginning with \"I\" or \"O\". This is to prevent confusion, because in many fonts, the capital letter L resembles the small letter l and the number 1 (one), and the capital letter O resembles a 0 (zero).\n\n==Changes==\nBelow is a summary of notable changes made to the ICD-11 compared to the ICD-10. One improvement of the ICD-11 MMS is a more flexible coding structure. In the ICD-10, every code starts with a letter and a two digit number (e.g. {{ICD10|P35}}). In a subcategory, this is followed by a dot and a single number (e.g. {{ICD10|P35.2}}), causing an artificial limitation of 10 subcategories per group (.0 to .9). In the ICD-11 MMS, this is resolved: after the 9, the digit continues with an A, then a B, and so on, theoretically allowing 36 subcategories (e.g. {{ICD11|KA62.A}}).<ref name=\"Reed_et_al._(2019)\">{{Cite journal | first=Geoffrey M. | last=Reed | display-authors=etal | date=2019 | title=Innovations and changes in the ICD\u201011 classification of mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders | url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wps.20611 | journal=[[World Psychiatry]] | volume=18 | issue=1 | doi=10.1002/wps.20611 | quote=<small>In the ICD\u201010, the number of groupings of disorders was artificially constrained by the decimal coding system used in the classification</small>}}</ref>\n\n===Mental disorders===\n\n====Overview====\nThe following mental disorders have been newly added to the ICD-11: [[Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder]] ({{ICD11|6B83}}), [[Binge eating disorder]] ({{ICD11|6B82}}), [[Bipolar type II disorder]] ({{ICD11|6A61}}), [[Body dysmorphic disorder]] ({{ICD11|6B21}}), [[Body integrity dysphoria]] ({{ICD11|6C21}}), [[Catatonia]] ({{ICD11|486722075|486722075}}), [[Complex post-traumatic stress disorder]] ({{ICD11|6B41}}), [[Excoriation disorder]] ({{ICD11|6B25.1}}), [[Frotteuristic disorder]] ({{ICD11|6D34}}), [[Gaming disorder]] ({{ICD11|6C51}}) [[Hoarding disorder]] ({{ICD11|6B24}}), [[Intermittent explosive disorder]] ({{ICD11|6C73}}), [[Olfactory reference disorder]] ({{ICD11|6B22}}), and [[Prolonged grief disorder]] ({{ICD11|6B42}}).<ref name=\"Reed_et_al._(2019)\" />\n\nOther notable changes include:<ref name=\"Reed_et_al._(2019)\" />\n\n* All [[personality disorders]] have been removed, and a dimensional model is used instead; see [[#Personality disorders|Personality disorders section]].\n* All subtypes of [[Schizophrenia]] (e.g. [[Paranoid schizophrenia|paranoid]], [[Disorganized schizophrenia|hebephrenic]], [[Catatonic schizophrenia|catatonic]]) have been removed. Instead, a dimensional model is used with the category Symptomatic manifestations of primary psychotic disorders ({{ICD11|6A25}}), which allows the coding for [[Positive symptoms]] ({{ICD11|6A25.0}}), [[Negative symptoms]] ({{ICD11|6A25.1}}), [[Depression (mood)|Depressive]] symptoms ({{ICD11|6A25.2}}), [[Manic]] symptoms ({{ICD11|6A25.3}}), [[:wikt:psychomotor|Psychomotor]] symptoms ({{ICD11|6A25.4}}), and [[Cognitive]] symptoms ({{ICD11|6A25.5}}).\n* [[Persistent mood disorders]] ({{ICD10|F34}}), which consists of [[Cyclothymia]] ({{ICD10|F34.0}}) and [[Dysthymia]] ({{ICD10|F34.1}}), have been deleted.\n* The ICD-10 differentiates between [[Phobic anxiety disorders]] ({{ICD10|F40}}), such as [[Agoraphobia]] ({{ICD10|F40.0}}), and Other anxiety disorders ({{ICD10|F41}}), such as [[Generalized anxiety disorder]] ({{ICD10|F41.1}}). The ICD-11 merges both groups together as [[Anxiety or fear-related disorders]] ({{ICD11|1336943699|1336943699}}).\n* All [[Pervasive developmental disorders]] ({{ICD10|F84}}) are merged into one category, [[Autism spectrum disorder]] ({{ICD11|6A02}}), except for [[Rett syndrome]], which is moved to the developmental anomalies chapter ({{ICD11|LD90.4}}).\n* [[Hyperkinetic disorders]] ({{ICD10|F90}}) is renamed [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] ({{ICD11|6A05}}), and a distinction in subtypes is made between [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder predominantly inattentive|predominantly inattentive]] ({{ICD11|6A05.0}}), predominantly hyperactive-impulsive ({{ICD11|6A05.1}}), and combined ({{ICD11|6A05.2}}). Hyperkinetic conduct disorder ({{ICD10|F90.1}}) has been removed.\n* [[Acute stress reaction]] ({{ICD10|F43.0}}) has been moved out of the mental disorder chapter, and placed in the chapter \"Factors influencing health status or contact with health services\" ({{ICD11|QE84}}). Thus, in the ICD-11, Acute stress reaction is no longer considered a mental disorder.<ref>{{Cite web | first=Jonathan D. | last=Raskin | title=What\u2019s New in the International Classification of Diseases? | url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/making-meaning/201807/what-s-new-in-the-international-classification-diseases | website=[[Psychology Today]] | date=25 July 2018 | archive-url=https://archive.fo/20200405171146/https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/making-meaning/201807/what-s-new-in-the-international-classification-diseases | archive-date=5 April 2020 | url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAsides from the updates made for the ICD-11, the WHO has also created an ICD-11 version of the ''Clinical descriptions and diagnostic guidelines'' (CDDG). A book of the same name was released in 1992<ref>[https://books.google.com/books/about/The_ICD_10_Classification_of_Mental_and.html?id=DFM0DgAAQBAJ Google Books entry on the CDDG]</ref> for the ICD-10, which was also known as the \"Blue Book\". It contains expanded definitions and diagnostic criteria for the mental disorders, whereas the ICD-10/-11 mental disorders chapters contain only short summaries. The ICD chapters are meant as a quick reference point, whereas the CDDG is meant for extensive diagnosing by health care professionals. To differentiate the old and the new version, the newest revision is called the ICD\u201011 CDDG. The WHO described the development of the ICD\u201011 CDDG as \"the most global, multilingual, multidisciplinary and participative revision process ever implemented for a [[classification of mental disorders]]\", involving nearly 15,000 clinicians from 155 countries.<ref name=\"Reed_et_al._(2019)\" /> As of April 2020, no release date of the ICD-11 CDDG has been given.\n\n====Personality disorders====\nThe [[personality disorder]] (PD) section has been completely revamped. All PDs have been merged into one: Personality disorder ({{ICD11|6D10}}), which can be coded as Mild ({{ICD11|6D10.0}}), Moderate ({{ICD11|6D10.1}}), Severe ({{ICD11|6D10.2}}), or severity unspecified ({{ICD11|6D10.Z}}). There is also an additional category called Personality difficulty ({{ICD11|QE50.7}}), which can be used to describe personality traits that are problematic, but do not rise to the level of a PD. Once a personality disorder or difficulty has been established, it may be specified by one or more Prominent personality traits or patterns ({{ICD11|6D11}}). The ICD-11 uses five trait domains: (1) [[Negative affectivity]] ({{ICD11|6D11.0}}); (2) Detachment ({{ICD11|6D11.1}}), (3) [[Dissociality]] ({{ICD11|6D11.2}}), (4) [[Disinhibition]] ({{ICD11|6D11.3}}), and (5) [[Anankastia]] ({{ICD11|6D11.4}}). Listed directly underneath is Borderline pattern ({{ICD11|6D11.5}}), a category similar to [[Borderline personality disorder]]. This is not a trait in itself but a combination of traits.\n\nDescribed as a clinical equivalent to the [[Big Five personality traits|Big Five model]],[chance for change] the five-trait system addresses several problems of the old category-based system. Of the ten PDs in the ICD-10, two were used with a disproportionate high frequency: [[Borderline personality disorder|Emotionally unstable personality disorder, borderline type]] ({{ICD10|F60.3}}) and [[Antisocial personality disorder|Dissocial (antisocial) personality disorder]] ({{ICD10|F60.2}}).{{ref label|a|a}} Many categories overlapped, and individuals with severe disorders often met the requirements for multiple PDs, which Reed et al. (2019) described as \"artificial [[Comorbidity#Mental health|comorbidity]]\".<ref name=\"Reed_et_al._(2019)\" /> PD was therefore reconceptualized in terms of a general dimension of severity, focusing on five negative personality traits which a person can have to various degrees.<ref name=\"Reed_(2018)\">{{Cite journal | first=Geoffrey M. | last=Reed | date=2018 | title=Progress in developing a classification of personality disorders for ICD\u201011 | url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wps.20533 | journal=World Psychiatry | volume=17 | issue=2 | pages=227-229 | doi=10.1002/wps.20533 | quote=PD was conceptualized in terms of a general dimension of severity, continuous with normal personality variation and sub\u2010threshold personality difficulty.}}</ref>\n\nThere was considerable debate regarding this new dimensional model, with many believing that categorical diagnosing should not be abandoned. In particular, there was disagreement about the status of Borderline personality disorder. Reed (2018) wrote: \"Some research suggests that borderline PD is not an independently valid category, but rather a [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity#Sociology|heterogeneous]] marker for PD severity. Other researchers view borderline PD as a valid and distinct clinical entity, and claim that 50 years of research support the validity of the category.

The ICD-11 replaces these with two main categories: [[Hypoactive sexual desire dysfunction]] ({{ICD11|HA00}}) and [[Sexual arousal dysfunction]] ({{ICD11|HA01}}). The latter has two subcategories: [[Female sexual arousal dysfunction]] ({{ICD11|HA01.0}}) and [[Male erectile dysfunction]] ({{ICD11|HA01.1}}). The difference between Hypoactive sexual desire dysfunction and Sexual arousal dysfunction is that in the former, there is a reduced or absent desire for sexual activity. In the latter, there is insufficient physical and emotional response to sexual activity, even though there still is a ''desire'' to engage in satisfying sex. The WHO acknowledged that there is an overlap between desire and arousal, but they are not the same. Management should focus on their distinct features. Furthermore, while there is no \"Male sexual arousal dysfunction\", the WHO has emphasized that Sexual arousal dysfunction can applied to both men and women, with female sexual dysfunction and male erectile problems being (sub)classified separately.<ref>Reed et al. (2016): <small>\"[T]he proposed ICD\u201011 category Hypoactive sexual desire dysfunction can be applied to both men and women, while Female sexual arousal dysfunction is classified separately.

As the WHO aimed to steer away from the aforementioned \"outdated mind/body split\", the organic and nonorganic disorders were merged. Vaginismus has been reclassified as [[Sexual pain\u2010penetration disorder]] ({{ICD11|HA20}}). Dyspareunia ({{ICD11|GA12}}) has been retained. A related condition is [[Vulvodynia]], which is in the ICD-9 ({{ICD9|625.7}}), but not in the ICD-10.

The ICD-10 categories [[Fetishism]] ({{ICD10|F65.0}}) and [[Fetishistic transvestism]] ({{ICD10|F65.1}}) were removed because, if they don't cause distress or harm, they are not considered mental disorders.

In the ICD-11, Dual-role transvestism was deleted due to a lack of public health or clinical relevance.<ref name=\"Reed_et_al._(2016)\" /> Transsexualism was renamed Gender incongruence of adolescence or adulthood ({{ICD11|HA60}}), and Gender identity disorder of childhood was renamed Gender incongruence of childhood ({{ICD11|HA61}}).\n\nIn the ICD-10, the Gender identity disorders were placed in the mental disorders chapter, following what was customary at the time. Throughout the 20st century, both the ICD and the [[DSM]] approached transgenderism from a psychopathological position, as transgenderism presents a discrepancy between someone's biologically assigned sex and the sex they perceive to have.

Alcmaeon had to retrieve the clothes from King [[Phegeus]], who sent his sons to kill Alcmaeon.\n\n[[File:Metropolitan Rubens Achelous.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|''The Banquet of Achelous'', by [[Rubens]], c. 1615]]\n\n[[Ovid]] in his ''Metamorphoses'' provided a descriptive interlude when [[Theseus]] is the guest of Achelous, waiting for the river's raging flood to subside: \"He entered the dark building, made of spongy pumice, and rough tuff. The floor was moist with soft moss, and the ceiling banded with freshwater mussel and oyster shells.\"<ref>[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' VIII, 547ff.</ref>  In sixteenth-century Italy, an aspect of the revival of Antiquity was the desire to recreate Classical spaces as extensions of the revived [[villa]].  Ovid's description of the cave of Achelous provided some specific inspiration to patrons in France as well as Italy for the [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] garden [[grotto]], with its cool dampness, [[tuff]] vaulting and shellwork walls. The banquet served by Ovid's Achelous offered a prototype for Italian midday feasts in the fountain-cooled shade of garden grottoes.\n\nAt the mouth of the Achelous River lie the [[Echinades]] Islands. According to Ovid's pretty myth-making in the same ''Metamorphoses'' episode, the Echinades Islands were once five nymphs. Unfortunately for them, they forgot to honor Achelous in their festivities, and the god was so angry about this slight that he turned them into the islands.\n\nIn Hellenistic and Roman contexts, the river god was often reduced to a mask and used decoratively as an emblem of water, \"his uncut hair wreathed with reeds\".<ref>[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' ix.</ref> The feature survived in Romanesque carved details and flowered during the [[Middle Ages]] as one of the Classical prototypes of the [[Green Man]].\n\n==Achelous and the River Achelous==\nHomer claims that the Achelous River was located in Lydia, near Mount Sipylos.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Iliad|last=Homer|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=24.616|quote=|via=}}</ref> There were at least six different rivers with the name Achelous in ancient times,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Potamikon: Sinews of Acheloios|author=Molinari and Sisci|publisher=|year=2016|location=|pages=61|quote=|via=}}</ref> all of which indicate that Achelous was originally not a single river, but a god of all water.\n\nThe origin of the river Achelous is described by [[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]]:\n<blockquote>When Achelous on one occasion had lost his daughters, the [[Siren (mythology)|Siren]]s, and in his grief invoked his mother Gaea, she received him to her bosom, and on the spot where she received him, she caused the river bearing his name to gush forth.<ref>Quoting Smith, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0104%3Aalphabetic+letter%3DA%3Aentry+group%3D3%3Aentry%3Dachelous-bio-1 s.v.

It resembled a bull's voice in the noise of the water; its windings and its reaches gave rise to the story about his forming himself into a serpent and about his horns; the formation of islands at the mouth of the river requires no explanation.  His conquest by Heracles lastly refers to the embankments by which Heracles confined the river to its bed and thus gained large tracts of land for cultivation, which are expressed by the horn of plenty.<ref>[[Strabo]], x. p. 458.</ref><ref>Compare Voss, ''Mythologische Briefe'', lxxii.</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* Andrews, Tamra.

He attended [[Sweet Home High School (Amherst, New York)|Sweet Home High School]] in [[Amherst, New York]]. He did not start his boxing career until he was about 19 years of age.\n\n== Boxing career ==\nHe was a New York State [[Golden Gloves]] champion, and as an amateur boxer he defeated future two-time Heavyweight champion [[Hasim Rahman]].  Mesi made it all the way to the finals in the 1996 Olympic Trials, but lost to eventual US heavyweight representative [[Lawrence Clay-Bey]].  In Buffalo, for a brief period, Joe was once considered by some to be the city's \"third professional franchise\", with the [[Buffalo Sabres]] and [[Buffalo Bills]] being the other two.  Joe is still often seen at Bills and Sabres games and also supports many local charities.\n\n=== Philanthropy ===\nIn 2002, Mesi started a non-profit to raise awareness about organ donation and transplantation upon finding out his cousin was in need of a kidney transplant, and to help others in the Upstate New York area who needed such surgeries. His cousin, Ganelle Shanor, died in an accident before she was able to receive the operation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.babyjoemesi.com/foundation.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-05-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206074408/http://babyjoemesi.com/foundation.htm |archivedate=2016-02-06 }}</ref> In January 2004, Mesi donated $7,500 to the Golisano Children's Hospital in Rochester, New York as a way of giving back to the Rochester community and to promote an upcoming fight at the Blue Cross Arena, with kidney transplant recipient Dillon Gonzalez and his family in attendance. The foundation was funded in part by admission fees to victory parties.<ref>https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/news/story/466/boxer-baby-joe-mesi-visits-golisano-childrens-hospital.aspx</ref>\n\n=== Injury and suspension ===\nMesi's promising boxing career was set back greatly when an MRI indicated he had suffered at least one, perhaps two [[subdural hematoma]]s <ref>http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/sports/3299563.html</ref>\n\nThe injuries came from a 2004 bout with former cruiserweight champion [[Vassiliy Jirov]].

Mesi managed to finish the fight on his feet and the bout was scored 94-93 for Mesi by all three judges.\n\nIn June 2005, Mesi, along with his attorneys and three doctors supporting his reinstatement, went before the [[Nevada State Athletic Commission]] to argue Mesi's hematomas had healed, and, he was, \"in no more danger than any other boxer.\"  Mesi's appeal was denied by a 5-0 vote.  In response to Dr. Julian E. Bailes, chairman of the department of neurosurgery at the [[West Virginia University School of Medicine]], opinion that: \"Football players and other athletes who had even more severe head injuries than Mesi were allowed to continue their careers without further harmful effects.\" Dr. Tony Alamo, one of the board's commissioners, replied, \"You play football, you don't play boxing.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/21/sports/othersports/suspension-upheld-but-boxer-is-fighting-it.html | work=The New York Times | title=Suspension Upheld But Boxer Is Fighting It | date=15 July 2019}}</ref> \n\nThe suspension effectively [[blacklist]]ed him from boxing anywhere in the United States under the premise of the [[full faith and credit clause]]. He launched several ineffective lawsuits against parties they claimed had leaked news of his health, while also appealing to Nevada representatives that he should be allowed to box. The suspension was officially lifted when Mesi's Nevada boxing license expired at the end of 2005. However, he was unable to renew the license due to the concerns of Nevada boxing officials. In 2006, Mesi was again licensed by boxing commissions in Puerto Rico, Louisiana, Arkansas and Michigan, with a handful of other states to follow suit in 2007. Over that time, Mesi won all of his handful of fights, though effectively retired from boxing in 2007. \n\nJoe Mesi had one of the longest active undefeated professional boxing records in the world for a heavyweight. Ranked #1 heavyweight contender by the WBC prior to his two-year layoff, Mesi was #16 in the December 2007 rankings.<ref name=\"mesiranking\">{{cite news\n |url=http://www.wbcboxing.com/WBCboxing/portal/cfpages/contentmgr.cfm?docId=94&docTipo=4&orderby=docid&sortby=ASC \n |publisher=World Boxing Council \n |title=WBC Heavyweight Ratings \n |date=October 13, 2007 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810070242/http://www.wbcboxing.com/WBCboxing/Portal/cfpages/contentmgr.cfm?docId=94&docTipo=4&orderby=docid&sortby=ASC \n |archivedate=August 10, 2007 \n}}</ref> In 2018, Mesi was inducted into the Greater Buffalo Sports Hall of Fame<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.buffalosportshallfame.com/member/baby-joe-mesi/ | work=Greater Buffalo Sports Hall of Fame | title=Profile of Baby Joe Mesi |date=6 April 2020}}</ref> and the New York State Boxing Hall of Fame.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.15rounds.com/meet-the-new-york-state-boxing-hof-class-of-2020/ | work=15 Rounds | title=Meet the New York State Boxing HOF Inductees | date=6 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Politics and life after boxing==\n\nOn February 14, 2008, Mesi publicly expressed his interest to run for the [[New York State Senate]].

retired [[Boxing|boxer]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] politician from [[Tonawanda, New York]].\n\n== Early life ==\nJoe grew up in [[City of Tonawanda|Tonawanda, New York]], a suburb of [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]. He attended [[Sweet Home High School (Amherst, New York)|Sweet Home High School]] in [[Amherst, New York]]. He did not start his boxing career until he was about 19 years of age.\n\n== Boxing career ==\nHe was a New York State [[Golden Gloves]] champion, and as an amateur boxer he defeated future two-time Heavyweight champion [[Hasim Rahman]].  Mesi made it all the way to the finals in the 1996 Olympic Trials, but lost to eventual US heavyweight representative [[Lawrence Clay-Bey]].  In Buffalo, for a brief period, Joe was once considered by some to be the city's \"third professional franchise\", with the [[Buffalo Sabres]] and [[Buffalo Bills]] being the other two.  Joe is still often seen at Bills and Sabres games and also supports many local charities.\n\n=== Philanthropy ===\nIn 2002, Mesi started a non-profit to raise awareness about organ donation and transplantation upon finding out his cousin was in need of a kidney transplant, and to help others in the Upstate New York area who needed such surgeries. His cousin, Ganelle Shanor, died in an accident before she was able to receive the operation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.babyjoemesi.com/foundation.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-05-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206074408/http://babyjoemesi.com/foundation.htm |archivedate=2016-02-06 }}</ref> In January 2004, Mesi donated $7,500 to the Golisano Children's Hospital in Rochester, New York as a way of giving back to the Rochester community and to promote an upcoming fight at the Blue Cross Arena, with kidney transplant recipient Dillon Gonzalez and his family in attendance. The foundation was funded in part by admission fees to victory parties.<ref>https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/news/story/466/boxer-baby-joe-mesi-visits-golisano-childrens-hospital.aspx</ref>\n\n=== Injury and suspension ===\nMesi's promising boxing career was set back greatly when an MRI indicated he had suffered at least one, perhaps two [[subdural hematoma]]s <ref>http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/sports/3299563.html</ref>\n\nThe injuries came from a 2004 bout with former cruiserweight champion [[Vassiliy Jirov]]. In round 9,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.muaylok.net/boxingrec/index.php?id=167 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325185242/http://www.muaylok.net/boxingrec/index.php?id=167 |archivedate=2012-03-25 }}</ref><ref>http://wn.com/Vassily_Jirov</ref> Mesi was knocked down from a right hook and in the tenth round he was knocked down two more times. Mesi managed to finish the fight on his feet and the bout was scored 94-93 for Mesi by all three judges.\n\nIn June 2005, Mesi, along with his attorneys and three doctors supporting his reinstatement, went before the [[Nevada State Athletic Commission]] to argue Mesi's hematomas had healed, and, he was, \"in no more danger than any other boxer.\"  Mesi's appeal was denied by a 5-0 vote.  In response to Dr. Julian E. Bailes, chairman of the department of neurosurgery at the [[West Virginia University School of Medicine]], opinion that: \"Football players and other athletes who had even more severe head injuries than Mesi were allowed to continue their careers without further harmful effects.\" Dr. Tony Alamo, one of the board's commissioners, replied, \"You play football, you don't play boxing.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/21/sports/othersports/suspension-upheld-but-boxer-is-fighting-it.html | work=The New York Times | title=Suspension Upheld But Boxer Is Fighting It | date=15 July 2019}}</ref> \n\nThe suspension effectively [[blacklist]]ed him from boxing anywhere in the United States under the premise of the [[full faith and credit clause]]. He launched several ineffective lawsuits against parties they claimed had leaked news of his health, while also appealing to Nevada representatives that he should be allowed to box. The suspension was officially lifted when Mesi's Nevada boxing license expired at the end of 2005. However, he was unable to renew the license due to the concerns of Nevada boxing officials. In 2006, Mesi was again licensed by boxing commissions in Puerto Rico, Louisiana, Arkansas and Michigan, with a handful of other states to follow suit in 2007. Over that time, Mesi won all of his handful of fights, though effectively retired from boxing in 2007. \n\nJoe Mesi had one of the longest active undefeated professional boxing records in the world for a heavyweight. Ranked #1 heavyweight contender by the WBC prior to his two-year layoff, Mesi was #16 in the December 2007 rankings.<ref name=\"mesiranking\">{{cite news\n |url=http://www.wbcboxing.com/WBCboxing/portal/cfpages/contentmgr.cfm?docId=94&docTipo=4&orderby=docid&sortby=ASC \n |publisher=World Boxing Council \n |title=WBC Heavyweight Ratings \n |date=October 13, 2007 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810070242/http://www.wbcboxing.com/WBCboxing/Portal/cfpages/contentmgr.cfm?docId=94&docTipo=4&orderby=docid&sortby=ASC \n |archivedate=August 10, 2007 \n}}</ref> In 2018, Mesi was inducted into the Greater Buffalo Sports Hall of Fame<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.buffalosportshallfame.com/member/baby-joe-mesi/ | work=Greater Buffalo Sports Hall of Fame | title=Profile of Baby Joe Mesi | web date=6 April 2020}}</ref> and the New York State Boxing Hall of Fame.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.15rounds.com/meet-the-new-york-state-boxing-hof-class-of-2020/ | work=15 Rounds | title=Meet the New York State Boxing HOF Inductees | web date=6 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Politics and life after boxing==\n\nOn February 14, 2008, Mesi publicly expressed his interest to run for the [[New York State Senate]].

It was designed in [[regency style]] by John Nash and consecrated in 1824.\n\nAs it is directly opposite [[Broadcasting House]], the BBC often broadcasts from the church. As well as the core church membership, many hundreds of visitors come to All Souls, bringing the average number of those coming through the doors for services on Sundays to around 2,500 every week. All Souls has an international congregation, with all ages represented.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:John Nash-1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Bust of architect [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]] outside the church]]\nThe church was designed by [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]], favourite architect of King [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]]. Its prominent circular spired vestibule was designed to  provide an eye-catching monument at the point where  [[Regent Street]], newly-laid out as part of Nash's scheme  to link [[Piccadilly]] with the new [[Regent's Park]], takes an awkward abrupt bend westward to align with the pre-existing [[Portland Place]].{{sfn|Summerson|1962|p=220}}\n\nAll Souls was a [[Commissioners' church]], a grant of \u00a312,819 (equivalent to \u00a3{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|12819|1824|r=-4}}}} in {{Inflation-year|UK}}){{Inflation-fn|UK}} being given by the [[Church Building Commission]] towards the cost of its construction.<ref>{{Citation | last = Port| first = M H.| author-link = |  year = 2006| title = 600 New Churches: The Church Building Commission 1818\u20131856 | edition = 2nd|  publication-place = Reading| publisher = Spire Books|  page = 328| isbn = 9781904965084| url = }}</ref> The commission had been set up under an act of 1818, and Nash, as one of the three architects employed by the [[Metropolitan Board of Works|Board of Works]], had been asked to supply specimen designs as soon as the act was passed.{{sfn|Summerson|1962|p=220}} It was, however, one of only two Commissioners' churches to be built to his designs, the other being the [[Gothic Revival]] [[St Mary, Haggerston]].{{sfn|Summerson|1962|p=220}}  All Souls is the last surviving church by John Nash.\n\nThe building was completed in December 1823 at a final cost of \u00a318,323 10s 5d. and was consecrated the following year by the [[Bishop of London]].\n\n==Architecture==\nThe church is built of [[Bath stone]]. It consists of a prominent spired circular [[Vestibule (architecture)|vestibule]],{{sfn|Summerson|1962|p=220}} attached to a much more reticent main church by the width of a single [[intercolumniation]]. The idiosyncratic [[spire]] is composed of seventeen concave sides encircled by a ''[[peripteros]]'' of [[Corinthian column]]s, making two separate sections. <!-- \nThe capitals are [[Ionic order|Ionic]] in design and made from [[Coade stone]]. Nash used an enriched version of the order that substitutes winged cherub's heads for the usual rosettes on the [[Abacus (architecture)|abacus]].  Interesting, but which part of the church is this?  -->\n\nNash's design was not met with universal praise. A reviewer for ''[[The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction]]'' 2 August 1828, said:\n{{quote| To our eye, the church itself, apart from the tower, (for such it almost is) is perhaps, one of the most miserable structures in the metropolis,\u2014in its starved proportions more resembling a manufactory, or warehouse, than the impressive character of a church exterior; an effect to which the Londoner is not an entire stranger. Here, too, we are inclined to ascribe much of the ridicule, which the whole church has received, to its puny proportions and scantiness of decoration, which are far from being assisted by any stupendousness in their details, the first impression of which might probably have fixed the attention of the spectator. Indeed, the whole style of the tower and steeple appears peculiarly illadapted for so small a scale as has here been attempted.{{sfn|Byerley|Timbs|1828|p=66}}}}\n\n== Crown appointment ==\n\nThe Rector of All Souls Church is still appointed by the [[Crown Appointments Commission]] at [[10 Downing Street]]. The links with the Crown date back to the time of George IV when the Crown acquired the land around the church. The [[Coat of Arms]] adorns the West Gallery.\n\n== Post-war restoration ==\nOn 8 December 1940, a Luftwaffe [[parachute mine]] exploded during [[the Blitz]], causing extensive damage to the church. The church was closed for some ten years while repair works were carried out. During this time, the congregation met for worship at [[St. Peter's, Vere Street]].<ref>[https://www.allsouls.org/Groups/132679/About_Us/History/History.aspx]</ref> Although many furnishings survived the bombing, such as the pulpit, these are no longer to be seen in the church.\n\n== Mid-1970s building project ==\n\nIn the early 1970s excavations were carried out at All Souls and when it was discovered that the foundations to the church were some 13 feet deep, the church undertook a massive building project under the supervision of then rector, [[Michael Baughen]] (who later became [[Bishop of Chester]], before returning to the London diocese to become an honorary assistant bishop). The decision was taken to embark on this work, to facilitate having a hall area underneath the church for the congregation and visitors to meet together after services and during the week. At the same time, the opportunity was taken to restructure the interior of the church to make it more suitable for present day forms of worship. It was at this time, that most fittings such as pews and choir stalls were removed, and the plain carpeted interior with moveable chairs was introduced.\n\n==Organ and music==\n\nAll Souls is well known for its musical tradition and part of this includes the [[Hunter organ]] installed in the west gallery in a [[Swietenia macrophylla|Spanish mahogany]] case designed by Nash. The case was enlarged and extended in 1913. In 1940, anticipating war damage to the church, the organ was dismantled and put into storage, then in 1951 remodelled and rebuilt, with a new rotatable electric manual and pedal console, and installed in the chancel by the firm of [[Henry Willis]] (IV). The organ was again rebuilt, by [[Harrison & Harrison]], during the building project of 1975\u20131976, when a four-manual console was added, plus a positive division and a pronounced fanfare-trumpet [[en-chamade]].<ref>[http://www.harrisonorgans.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Langham-Place-full-spec.pdf Organ specifications]</ref> In 1933, [[John Ivimey]] was appointed as organist and Director of Music.<ref>\"MUSIC APPOINTMENT\" in Cheltenham Chronicle dated Saturday 19 August 1933, p. 6</ref>\n\nMusical worship mixes contemporary and traditional styles, featuring either the church's worship band, orchestra, singing group or choir at all the main regular Sunday services, under the leadership of Michael Andrews. In 1972, the All Souls Orchestra was founded by former director of music and Emeritus Conductor, [[No\u00ebl Tredinnick]], and has accompanied Sir [[Cliff Richard]], [[Stuart Townend (musician)|Stuart Townend]] and other notable Christian artists. The orchestra and a massed choir perform annually at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] for the All Souls \"Prom Praise\" concert, which also tours across the UK and internationally. \"Prom Praise for Schools\" is sometimes held alongside Prom Praise, providing children from across the [[Diocese of London]] the chance to sing with the All Souls Orchestra. In 2012, the All Souls Orchestra celebrated its 40th anniversary, alongside special guests including [[Graham Kendrick]], [[Keith & Kristyn Getty]], and Jonathan Veira.\n\n== Worship ==\nAll Souls celebrates four services each Sunday, with an early morning [[Holy Communion]] service at 8:00 am, followed by two other services at 9:30 am and 11:30 am and an evening service at 5:30 pm. There is also a midweek service on Thursdays during term time at 1:05 pm.\n\nSermons from Sunday services are uploaded for free streaming and download by the following Monday afternoon. The archive now contains over 3,000 sermons.\n\n== Clergy ==\n[[File:All Souls Church, Langham Place, London, UK - Diliff.jpg|thumb|right|280px|All Souls Church interior as viewed from the balcony]]\nThe current [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] is the Revd Hugh Palmer, who, {{asof|July 2012|lc=yes}}, is also a chaplain to [[Queen Elizabeth II|the queen]].<ref>[http://www.thedukeofyork.org/Home/RecentEngagements/engagements.aspx 'Engagements'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121029052425/http://www.thedukeofyork.org/Home/RecentEngagements/engagements.aspx |date=2012-10-29 }}, Duke of York.

As a reflection of the huge diversity of the church's congregation (over 60 nationalities represented amongst the c 2500 present on Sundays), the staff team has gradually become more international (Kenya, the United States, Canada, South Africa, New Zealand, Sweden, Germany, Hungary, Korea and Ireland amongst others).{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nOne of the church's most notable clerics was [[John Stott]] [[CBE]], who was associated with All Souls for his entire ministry and virtually all his life. The author of more than fifty Christian books, Stott was regarded as an important theologian and leader of the evangelical movement during the 20th century.<ref>In a November 2004 editorial on Stott, ''[[The New York Times]]'' columnist [[David Brooks (journalist)|David Brooks]] cited Michael Cromartie of the Ethics and Public Policy Center as saying that \"if evangelicals could elect a [[pope]], Stott is the person they would likely choose.\" https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/30/opinion/30brooks.html</ref> Stott was a [[curate]] at All Souls 1945\u20131950 and rector 1950\u20131975. He resigned as rector in 1975 to pursue his wider ministry, but maintained his involvement with the church and was given the title of Rector [[Emeritus]], which he held until his death in 2011. Stott's obituary in ''[[Christianity Today]]'' described him as \"An architect of 20th-century evangelicalism [who] shaped the faith of a generation.\"<ref>[http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2011/julyweb-only/john-stott-obit.html Obituary in ''Christianity Today'']</ref>\n\nThe Revd Richard Bewes was rector from 1983 until his retirement in 2004.

It was designed in [[regency style]] by John Nash and consecrated in 1824.\n\nAs it is directly opposite [[Broadcasting House]], the BBC often broadcasts from the church. As well as the core church membership, many hundreds of visitors come to All Souls, bringing the average number of those coming through the doors for services on Sundays to around 2,500 every week. All Souls has an international congregation, with all ages represented.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:John Nash-1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Bust of architect [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]] outside the church]]\nThe church was designed by [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]], favourite architect of King [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]]. Its prominent circular spired vestibule was designed to  provide an eye-catching monument at the point where  [[Regent Street]], newly-laid out as part of Nash's scheme  to link [[Piccadilly]] with the new [[Regent's Park]], takes an awkward abrupt bend westward to align with the pre-existing [[Portland Place]].{{sfn|Summerson|1962|p=220}}\n\nAll Souls was a [[Commissioners' church]], a grant of \u00a312,819 (equivalent to \u00a3{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|12819|1824|r=-4}}}} in {{Inflation-year|UK}}){{Inflation-fn|UK}} being given by the [[Church Building Commission]] towards the cost of its construction.<ref>{{Citation | last = Port| first = M H.| author-link = |  year = 2006| title = 600 New Churches: The Church Building Commission 1818\u20131856 | edition = 2nd|  publication-place = Reading| publisher = Spire Books|  page = 328| isbn = 9781904965084| url = }}</ref> The commission had been set up under an act of 1818, and Nash, as one of the three architects employed by the [[Metropolitan Board of Works|Board of Works]], had been asked to supply specimen designs as soon as the act was passed.{{sfn|Summerson|1962|p=220}} It was, however, one of only two Commissioners' churches to be built to his designs, the other being the [[Gothic Revival]] [[St Mary, Haggerston]].{{sfn|Summerson|1962|p=220}}  All Souls is the last surviving church by John Nash.\n\nThe building was completed in December 1823 at a final cost of \u00a318,323 10s 5d. and was consecrated the following year by the [[Bishop of London]].\n\n==Architecture==\nThe church is built of [[Bath stone]]. It consists of a prominent spired circular [[Vestibule (architecture)|vestibule]],{{sfn|Summerson|1962|p=220}} attached to a much more reticent main church by the width of a single [[intercolumniation]]. The idiosyncratic [[spire]] is composed of seventeen concave sides encircled by a ''[[peripteros]]'' of [[Corinthian column]]s, making two separate sections. <!-- \nThe capitals are [[Ionic order|Ionic]] in design and made from [[Coade stone]]. Nash used an enriched version of the order that substitutes winged cherub's heads for the usual rosettes on the [[Abacus (architecture)|abacus]].  Interesting, but which part of the church is this?  -->\n\nNash's design was not met with universal praise. A reviewer for ''[[The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction]]'' 2 August 1828, said:\n{{quote| To our eye, the church itself, apart from the tower, (for such it almost is) is perhaps, one of the most miserable structures in the metropolis,\u2014in its starved proportions more resembling a manufactory, or warehouse, than the impressive character of a church exterior; an effect to which the Londoner is not an entire stranger. Here, too, we are inclined to ascribe much of the ridicule, which the whole church has received, to its puny proportions and scantiness of decoration, which are far from being assisted by any stupendousness in their details, the first impression of which might probably have fixed the attention of the spectator. Indeed, the whole style of the tower and steeple appears peculiarly illadapted for so small a scale as has here been attempted.{{sfn|Byerley|Timbs|1828|p=66}}}}\n\n== Crown appointment ==\n\nThe Rector of All Souls Church is still appointed by the [[Crown Appointments Commission]] at [[10 Downing Street]]. The links with the Crown date back to the time of George IV when the Crown acquired the land around the church. The [[Coat of Arms]] adorns the West Gallery.\n\n== Post-war restoration ==\nOn 8 December 1940, a Luftwaffe [[parachute mine]] exploded during [[the Blitz]], causing extensive damage to the church. The church was closed for some ten years while repair works were carried out. During this time, the congregation met for worship at [[St. Peter's, Vere Street]].<ref>[https://www.allsouls.org/Groups/132679/About_Us/History/History.aspx]</ref> Although many furnishings survived the bombing, such as the pulpit, these are no longer to be seen in the church.\n\n== Mid-1970s building project ==\n\nIn the early 1970s excavations were carried out at All Souls and when it was discovered that the foundations to the church were some 13 feet deep, the church undertook a massive building project under the supervision of then rector, [[Michael Baughen]] (who later became [[Bishop of Chester]], before returning to the London diocese to become an honorary assistant bishop). The decision was taken to embark on this work, to facilitate having a hall area underneath the church for the congregation and visitors to meet together after services and during the week. At the same time, the opportunity was taken to restructure the interior of the church to make it more suitable for present day forms of worship. It was at this time, that most fittings such as pews and choir stalls were removed, and the plain carpeted interior with moveable chairs was introduced.\n\n==Organ and music==\n\nAll Souls is well-known for its musical tradition and part of this includes the [[Hunter organ]] installed in the west gallery in a [[Swietenia macrophylla|Spanish mahogany]] case designed by Nash. The case was enlarged and extended in 1913. In 1940, anticipating war damage to the church, the organ was dismantled and put into storage, then in 1951 remodelled and rebuilt, with a new rotatable electric manual and pedal console, and installed in the chancel by the firm of [[Henry Willis]] (IV). The organ was again rebuilt, by [[Harrison & Harrison]], during the building project of 1975\u20131976, when a four-manual console was added, plus a positive division and a pronounced fanfare-trumpet [[en-chamade]].<ref>[http://www.harrisonorgans.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Langham-Place-full-spec.pdf Organ specifications]</ref> In 1933, [[John Ivimey]] was appointed as organist and Director of Music.<ref>\"MUSIC APPOINTMENT\" in Cheltenham Chronicle dated Saturday 19 August 1933, p. 6</ref>\n\nMusical worship mixes contemporary and traditional styles, featuring either the church's worship band, orchestra, singing group or choir at all the main regular Sunday services, under the leadership of Michael Andrews. In 1972, the All Souls Orchestra was founded by former director of music and Emeritus Conductor, [[No\u00ebl Tredinnick]], and has accompanied Sir [[Cliff Richard]], [[Stuart Townend (musician)|Stuart Townend]] and other notable Christian artists. The orchestra and a massed choir perform annually at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] for the All Souls \"Prom Praise\" concert, which also tours across the UK and internationally. \"Prom Praise for Schools\" is sometimes held alongside Prom Praise, providing children from across the [[Diocese of London]] the chance to sing with the All Souls Orchestra. In 2012, the All Souls Orchestra celebrated its 40th anniversary, alongside special guests including [[Graham Kendrick]], [[Keith & Kristyn Getty]], and Jonathan Veira.\n\n== Worship ==\nAll Souls celebrates four services each Sunday, with an early morning [[Holy Communion]] service at 8:00 am, followed by two other services at 9:30 am and 11:30 am and an evening service at 5:30 pm. There is also a midweek service on Thursdays during term time at 1:05 pm.\n\nSermons from Sunday services are uploaded for free streaming and download by the following Monday afternoon. The archive now contains over 3,000 sermons.\n\n== Clergy ==\n[[File:All Souls Church, Langham Place, London, UK - Diliff.jpg|thumb|right|280px|All Souls Church interior as viewed from the balcony]]\nThe current [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] is the Revd Hugh Palmer, who, {{asof|July 2012|lc=yes}}, is also a chaplain to [[Queen Elizabeth II|the queen]].<ref>[http://www.thedukeofyork.org/Home/RecentEngagements/engagements.aspx 'Engagements'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121029052425/http://www.thedukeofyork.org/Home/RecentEngagements/engagements.aspx |date=2012-10-29 }}, Duke of York.

As a reflection of the huge diversity of the church's congregation (over 60 nationalities represented amongst the c 2500 present on Sundays), the staff team has gradually become more international (Kenya, the United States, Canada, South Africa, New Zealand, Sweden, Germany, Hungary, Korea and Ireland amongst others).{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nOne of the church's most notable clerics was [[John Stott]] [[CBE]], who was associated with All Souls for his entire ministry and virtually all his life. The author of more than fifty Christian books, Stott was regarded as an important theologian and leader of the evangelical movement during the 20th century.<ref>In a November 2004 editorial on Stott, ''[[The New York Times]]'' columnist [[David Brooks (journalist)|David Brooks]] cited Michael Cromartie of the Ethics and Public Policy Center as saying that \"if evangelicals could elect a [[pope]], Stott is the person they would likely choose.\" https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/30/opinion/30brooks.html</ref> Stott was a [[curate]] at All Souls 1945\u20131950 and rector 1950\u20131975. He resigned as rector in 1975 to pursue his wider ministry, but maintained his involvement with the church and was given the title of Rector [[Emeritus]], which he held until his death in 2011. Stott's obituary in ''[[Christianity Today]]'' described him as \"An architect of 20th-century evangelicalism [who] shaped the faith of a generation.\"<ref>[http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2011/julyweb-only/john-stott-obit.html Obituary in ''Christianity Today'']</ref>\n\nThe Revd Richard Bewes was rector from 1983 until his retirement in 2004.

A galaxy of Indian scientists joined the Chairs set up with the income of the endowments of nearly '''thirty seven and half lakhs rupees''' donated by [[Taraknath Palit|Sir Taraknath Palit]] and [[Rash Behari Ghosh|Sir Rashbehari Ghosh]] who were associated with the National Education Movement in Bengal since the Indian Universities Act of 1904-5 and the partition of Bengal in 1905.\n\nThe first group of faculties included [[Acharya Prafulla Chandra Ray]], [[Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman]], [[Ganesh Prasad]], [[Sisir Kumar Mitra]] and the legendary 1915 M.Sc. batch comprising [[Satyendranath Bose]], [[Meghnad Saha]], [[Jnan Chandra Ghosh]], [[Jnanendra Nath Mukherjee]] among others.<ref name=\"caluniv-ucsta1\"/> The holders of the Chairs often worked under great financial constraints and with whatever apparatus was locally available in Calcutta. Yet their scientific research was soon to put Calcutta University on the map of World Recognition. The science that developed at Calcutta University in colonial India was not a colonial science, as it was hardly supported by any large scale imperial funds and was solely meant for ''\"The promotion and diffusion of scientific and technical education for the cultivation and advancement of science, both pure and applied among Indians\".''<ref name=\"insa.nic.in\"/>\n\n===Science in Calcutta University before 1914===\n\nOne reason why Calcutta University could not develop a research programme in science earlier than 1914 was partly because of a great handicap inherent in its constitution and partly because of the paucity of funds needed for the development of such an institute at the post-graduation level. Till the end of 19th century Calcutta University remained mainly an examination body fed by a number of affiliated colleges which actually did teaching and which were dispersed from [[Shimla]] and [[Mussorie]] to [[Indore]] and [[Jaipur]], and from [[Jaffna]] and [[Batticaloa]] to [[Sylhet]] and [[Chittagong]]. In these colleges there was hardly any provision for teaching of science courses with the exception of three colleges each in Civil Engineering and Medicine, all the 85 colleges in British India by 1882 were teaching courses in liberal arts leading to matriculation, F.A., B.A., Honours and M.A. Career in India was never virtually open to talents, through the principle had been asserted time and again allay fear in the Charter Act of 1883 and the Queen's Proclamation of 1858 after the Mutiny to allay fear, suspecion and distrust. In those days agriculture, manufacturing and commerce offered little to no incentives and was almost impossible to initiate without proper skills, capital and equality of terms with which it could compete with the European industry. Such discontenment among the educated unemployed gave rise to militant nationalism threatening the existence of very British Raj in India. Higher education in India was singled out as the root for all evils. So to curb this growing distress, [[Lord Curzon]] (then Viceroy of India) passed the Indian University Act in 1904 based on the recommendation of the Indian University Commission in 1902. While the various recommendations of the Commission to enable the Raj to control higher education in India were not strictly relevant here, some at least relating to the creation of new courses in science became important. The commission for the first time suggested the creation of the Faculty of Science and Technology in addition to the faculties of Arts, Law, Medicine and Civil Engineering previously offered by Calcutta University. Thus Bachelor of Science(B.Sc.) and Master of Science(M.Sc.) courses were introduced for first time in India. The commission also recommended the award of Doctor of Science(D.Sc.) degree which is to be given to a M.Sc. after some years spent in original investigations.\n\nWhen [[Asutosh Mookerjee|Sir Ashutosh Mookerjee]] became the Vice Chancellor of Calcutta University in 1906, seized the Indian University Act of 1904-5 and converted the university from an examination body to a teaching university which will not only start post graduate degrees in Humnanities, English, Sanskrit, Pali, Arabic, Persian, Mental & Moral Phyilosophy, History, Economics and Mathematics but also establish chairs in some of them with financial support from the government by 1912. But for seven years, Mookerjee struggled hard to establish postgraduate teaching and research in Science and Technology despite his best intentions. The paucity of funds and accommodations were deplorable which meant that even if there were men, there was no accommodation laboratories, workshops, museums, equipments etc. In Presidency College a small room measuring 35'6\" by 25'6\" was available to be used as a laboratory room, preparation room and as well as a practical room for biology and physiology classes, whereas a large number of B.A. students did not get the opportunity of having a regular course of practical training.<ref name=\"insa.nic.in\"/>\n\n===Establishment of the University College of Science and Technology===\n\nIn these circumstances, [[Calcutta University]] was pleasantly surprised to receive the princely gifts of [[Taraknath Palit|Sir Taraknath Palit]], an eminent barrister and advocate of national education during the Anti-Partition movement(1905). In June and October 1912, he donated total assets of fourteen and a half lakh rupees which included his own dwelling house. His donations were made over to the university for the advancement of Science and Technology and were used to maintain the income of endowment of Physics and Chemistry Chair and also to institute scholarships to distinguished graduates of Calcutta University for higher studies. The university had to provide \"from its own funds\" suitable lecture rooms, libraries, museums, laboratories, workshops and other facilities for teaching and research. As the funds provided by the University was not fully adequate, Mookerjee approached the Government of India for financial support. which was rejected by [[Henry Sharp]] who was the joint secretary in department of education. The opposition of Sharp mainly emanated from his dislike of Calcutta University which he considered will become a non-political body with strong prejudice against the white men and the Europeans. He said, \"To give this money to this place is to give money to the cause which will embarrass ourselves. The money will go to political ends rather than to truly educational ends.\"\n\nIn August 1913, [[Rash Behari Ghosh|Sir Rashbehari Ghosh]], an eminent jurist and scholar, in a letter to Asutosh Mookerjee placed in the hands of the University \"a sum of ten lakh rupees\" as per the conditions of his gift, there were to be established four chairs - one each for Applied Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry and Botany, with special reference to Agriculture, and eight studentships to be awarded to the distinguished graduates of this University \"to carry on investigation\" under the guidance of a professor. Both Palit and Ghosh wanted promotion and diffusion of scientific and technical education among their countrymen by indigenous agency and with the money now available through their endowments, Mookerjee could now launch his projected dream. Thus four days before the expiry of the fourth term of his Vice-Chancellorship, Mookerjee laid the founding stone of the University College of Science and Technology on 27 March 1914 hoping fervently that \"although the College of Science and Technology is an integral part of the University of Calcutta, it will be regarded not as a provincial but as an all-India college of Science and Technology to which students will flock from every corner of the Indian Empire, attracted by the excellence of the instruction imparted and of the facilities  provided for research.\"\n\nThe influence of the teachings of [[Raja Rammohan Roy]]  on the importance of education broadly based on science and technology impressed a group of newly graduated scientists [[S.N. Bose]], [[Jnan Chandra Ghosh]], [[Meghnad Saha|M.N. Saha]], [[N.R. Sen]], [[Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis|P.C. Mahalanobis]], [[Sisir Kumar Mitra|S.K. Mitra]] and [[Jnanendranath Mukherjee]]. [[Ashutosh Mukherjee|Sir Asutosh Mukherjee]] believed in young talents, selected promising young men and appointed them straightaway  as lecturers in post graduate classes of newly formed Sc. College and provided them research facilities also. He was the first and perhaps the last to establish a centre of academic studies at the University stage with distinct atmosphere of learning and scholarships and appointed some of the best men available in the country as University Professor or Lecturers.\n\nThe establishment of the Calcutta University College of Science and Technology signals the beginning of outstanding research in some branches of science and applied science, which put India on the map of World Recognnition. A galaxy of Indian Scientists joined the departments set up with the income of edowments donated by Palit and Ghosh and began their work in Science with whatever apparatus available in India and soon made their mark in their chosen fields. Palit Chairs in Physics and Chemistry and Ghosh Chairs in Applied Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics and Botany were soon filled up after the formal establishment of the University College of Science and Technology in March 1914.<ref name=\"insa.nic.in\"/>\n\n===Keys to the Start of Outstanding Research in \"Non-Colonial\" Science in Colonial India===\n\nThe establishment of Chairs in Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics, Zoology and Botany was the start of outstanding research and teaching by dedicated Indian Scientists. [[Asutosh Mookerjee|Sir Asutosh Mookerjee]] who became the first president of the first session of the Indian Science Congress at Calcutta, where nearly a hundred scientist met in 26 January 1914, took great care to identify the right talent for the right post from different parts of India in science as in humanities and was able to attribute to the \"University College of Science and Technology\" as a true national character. No nation could live solely upon the achievements of its past or upon its borrowing from others, and at the same time hoped to retain its place among the great people of the Earth. Besides advancing the frontiers of knowledge, the work by the Indian Scientists at the University College of Science and Technology not only helped in increasing the wealth of the country but also succeeded in drawing attention of the scientific world. The dedication and devotion with which the Indian Scientists at the University College of Science and Technology began their work to explain the many unknown phenomena can only remind us of the zeal and enthusiasm with which William Jones and his choice band of thirty elite Englishmen in 1783-84 had began their investigations into \"the history and antiquities, arts, sciences and literature of Asia.\"\n\nDespite the fact that the University College of Science and Technology was a department of Calcutta University set up as a part of the colonial educational despatch of 1854. there had been no substantial financial support from the British Raj to encourage the Indian Scientists in their works presumably under the idea that Indian brains were not suitable for scientific research despite great promise shown by [[Jagadish Chandra Bose]] and [[Prafulla Chandra Ray]] at the [[Presidency College]] years before the foundation of the University College of Science and Technology. Of the total expenditure of rupees 18, 13, 959 of the University College of Science and Technology between March 1914 and March 1922, the Government of India's contributions from public funds was a meagre rupees 1, 20, 000 only. Yet in spite of these financial contraints and difficulties none of the scientists left for better position in imperial organisations. Instead classic example was provided by [[Prafulla Chandra Ray]] who when re-appointed Palit Professor for 5 years after reaching the age of superannuation donated his full monthly salary for the entire period for the special benefit of his department which was \"proud to acknowledge him as its leader\". During this difficult time, there had  been \"a steady output of original work rapidly increasing in volume and improving in quality which emanated not from one or two extraordinarily isolated or exceptionally gifted workers blessed with special advantages and facilities, but from a large body of able and devoted scholars\". No doubt, the scientists at the University College of Science and Technology sowed the sowed the seeds of many a promissing project which were to bear fruits in the post-independence years. The University College of Science and Technology was indeed as oasis of scienctific research in India since 1914.<ref name=\"insa.nic.in\"/>\n \n[[Sir C.V. Raman]], A Palit Professor of Sc. College made this revolutionary discovery on the \"Scattering of Light\" which is known as [[Raman Effect|The Raman Effect]]. He announced his discovery on February 28, 1928 and was awarded the Noble Prize in Physics, the day widely celebrated as [[National Science Day|the National Science Day]] in India. The IIT system is entirely planned designed and created by the  Chemist [[Jnan Chandra Ghosh|Sir Jnan Chandra Ghosh]] who also became the first director of the newly created IIT in 1951 ([[Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur]]).<ref>{{cite web|author=Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur |url=http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/about-iitkgp-history |title=Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur |publisher=Iitkgp.ac.in |date= |accessdate=2020-01-28}}</ref> Sir J.C. Ghosh also was the second person to be associated with Sc. College (after Sir CV Raman) who became the director of IISc ([[Indian Institute of Science]]). Prof. A.P.C Ray founded the Bengal Chemicals and Pharmaceutical Work and he along with prof. Hemendra Kumar Sen established the department of Applied Chemistry in Sc. College in 1920. [[Sisir Kumar Mitra|Prof. S.K. Mitra]], the pioneer of Radio Science in India founded the department of Radio Physics and Electronics which [[Bidhan Chandra Roy|Dr. Bidhan Chandra Roy]] (then chief minister of Bengal) laid the founding stone of, on April 21, 1949.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irpel.org/HistoryDetails.aspx |title=Institute of Radio Physics and Electronics &#124; (IRPE) |publisher=Irpel.org |date= |accessdate=2020-01-28}}</ref> \n\nNotable scholars associated with Science college include one [[Noble Laureate]] in Physics, two [[National Film Awards|National Award]] & [[Dadasaheb Phalke Award]] winning \"Film Directors\", atleast twenty-five [[Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology|Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Laureates]] and several fellows [[Royal Society of London]], [[Indian National Science Academy]], [[Indian Academy of Sciences]], [[Infosys Prize|Infosys]] and [[Om Prakash Bhasin Award]] Recipients, [[Order of the British Empire|British Knighthood]] title holders and [[Padma Shree|Padma]] Awardees.

A galaxy of Indian scientists joined the Chairs set up with the income of the endowments of nearly '''thirty seven and half lakhs rupees''' donated by [[Taraknath Palit|Sir Taraknath Palit]] and [[Rash Behari Ghosh|Sir Rashbehari Ghosh]] who were associated with the National Education Movement in Bengal since the Indian Universities Act of 1904-5 and the partition of Bengal in 1905.\n\nThe first group of faculties included [[Acharya Prafulla Chandra Ray]], [[Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman]], [[Ganesh Prasad]], [[Sisir Kumar Mitra]] and the legendary 1915 M.Sc. batch comprising [[Satyendranath Bose]], [[Meghnad Saha]], [[Jnan Chandra Ghosh]], [[Jnanendra Nath Mukherjee]] among others.<ref name=\"caluniv-ucsta1\"/> The holders of the Chairs often worked under great financial constraints and with whatever apparatus was locally available in Calcutta. Yet their scientific research was soon to put Calcutta University on the map of World Recognition. The science that developed at Calcutta University in colonial India was not a colonial science, as it was hardly supported by any large scale imperial funds and was solely meant for ''\"The promotion and diffusion of scientific and technical education for the cultivation and advancement of science, both pure and applied among Indians\".''<ref name=\"insa.nic.in\"/>\n\n===Science in Calcutta University before 1914===\n\nOne reason why Calcutta University could not develop a research programme in science earlier than 1914 was partly because of a great handicap inherent in its constitution and partly because of the paucity of funds needed for the development of such an institute at the post-graduation level. Till the end of 19th century Calcutta University remained mainly an examination body fed by a number of affiliated colleges which actually did teaching and which were dispersed from [[Shimla]] and [[Mussorie]] to [[Indore]] and [[Jaipur]], and from [[Jaffna]] and [[Batticaloa]] to [[Sylhet]] and [[Chittagong]]. In these colleges there was hardly any provision for teaching of science courses with the exception of three colleges each in Civil Engineering and Medicine, all the 85 colleges in British India by 1882 were teaching courses in liberal arts leading to matriculation, F.A., B.A., Honours and M.A. Career in India was never virtually open to talents, through the principle had been asserted time and again allay fear in the Charter Act of 1883 and the Queen's Proclamation of 1858 after the Mutiny to allay fear, suspecion and distrust. In those days agriculture, manufacturing and commerce offered little to no incentives and was almost impossible to initiate without proper skills, capital and equality of terms with which it could compete with the European industry. Such discontenment among the educated unemployed gave rise to militant nationalism threatening the existence of very British Raj in India. Higher education in India was singled out as the root for all evils. So to curb this growing distress, [[Lord Curzon]] (then Viceroy of India) passed the Indian University Act in 1904 based on the recommendation of the Indian University Commission in 1902. While the various recommendations of the Commission to enable the Raj to control higher education in India were not strictly relevant here, some at least relating to the creation of new courses in science became important. The commission for the first time suggested the creation of the Faculty of Science and Technology in addition to the faculties of Arts, Law, Medicine and Civil Engineering previously offered by Calcutta University. Thus Bachelor of Science(B.Sc.) and Master of Science(M.Sc.) courses were introduced for first time in India. The commission also recommended the award of Doctor of Science(D.Sc.) degree which is to be given to a M.Sc. after some years spent in original investigations.\n\nWhen [[Asutosh Mookerjee|Sir Ashutosh Mookerjee]] became the Vice Chancellor of Calcutta University in 1906, seized the Indian University Act of 1904-5 and converted the university from an examination body to a teaching university which will not only start post graduate degrees in Humnanities, English, Sanskrit, Pali, Arabic, Persian, Mental & Moral Phyilosophy, History, Economics and Mathematics but also establish chairs in some of them with financial support from the government by 1912. But for seven years, Mookerjee struggled hard to establish postgraduate teaching and research in Science and Technology despite his best intentions. The paucity of funds and accommodations were deplorable which meant that even if there were men, there was no accommodation laboratories, workshops, museums, equipments etc. In Presidency College a small room measuring 35'6\" by 25'6\" was available to be used as a laboratory room, preparation room and as well as a practical room for biology and physiology classes, whereas a large number of B.A. students did not get the opportunity of having a regular course of practical training.<ref name=\"insa.nic.in\"/>\n\n===Establishment of the University College of Science and Technology===\n\nIn these circumstances, [[Calcutta University]] was pleasantly surprised to receive the princely gifts of [[Taraknath Palit|Sir Taraknath Palit]], an eminent barrister and advocate of national education during the Anti-Partition movement(1905). In June and October 1912, he donated total assets of fourteen and a half lakh rupees which included his own dwelling house. His donations were made over to the university for the advancement of Science and Technology and were used to maintain the income of endowment of Physics and Chemistry Chair and also to institute scholarships to distinguished graduates of Calcutta University for higher studies. The university had to provide \"from its own funds\" suitable lecture rooms, libraries, museums, laboratories, workshops and other facilities for teaching and research. As the funds provided by the University was not fully adequate, Mookerjee approached the Government of India for financial support. which was rejected by [[Henry Sharp]] who was the joint secretary in department of education. The opposition of Sharp mainly emanated from his dislike of Calcutta University which he considered will become a non-political body with strong prejudice against the white men and the Europeans. He said, \"To give this money to this place is to give money to the cause which will embarrass ourselves. The money will go to political ends rather than to truly educational ends.\"\n\nIn August 1913, [[Rash Behari Ghosh|Sir Rashbehari Ghosh]], an eminent jurist and scholar, in a letter to Asutosh Mookerjee placed in the hands of the University \"a sum of ten lakh rupees\" as per the conditions of his gift, there were to be established four chairs - one each for Applied Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry and Botany, with special reference to Agriculture, and eight studentships to be awarded to the distinguished graduates of this University \"to carry on investigation\" under the guidance of a professor. Both Palit and Ghosh wanted promotion and diffusion of scientific and technical education among their countrymen by indigenous agency and with the money now available through their endowments, Mookerjee could now launch his projected dream. Thus four days before the expiry of the fourth term of his Vice-Chancellorship, Mookerjee laid the founding stone of the University College of Science and Technology on 27 March 1914 hoping fervently that \"although the College of Science and Technology is an integral part of the University of Calcutta, it will be regarded not as a provincial but as an all-India college of Science and Technology to which students will flock from every corner of the Indian Empire, attracted by the excellence of the instruction imparted and of the facilities  provided for research.\"\n\nThe influence of the teachings of [[Raja Rammohan Roy]]  on the importance of education broadly based on science and technology impressed a group of newly graduated scientists [[S.N. Bose]], [[Jnan Chandra Ghosh]], [[Meghnad Saha|M.N. Saha]], [[N.R. Sen]], [[Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis|P.C. Mahalanobis]], [[Sisir Kumar Mitra|S.K. Mitra]] and [[Jnanendranath Mukherjee]]. [[Ashutosh Mukherjee|Sir Asutosh Mukherjee]] believed in young talents, selected promising young men and appointed them straightaway  as lecturers in post graduate classes of newly formed Sc. College and provided them research facilities also. He was the first and perhaps the last to establish a centre of academic studies at the University stage with distinct atmosphere of learning and scholarships and appointed some of the best men available in the country as University Professor or Lecturers.\n\nThe establishment of the Calcutta University College of Science and Technology signals the beginning of outstanding research in some branches of science and applied science, which put India on the map of World Recognnition. A galaxy of Indian Scientists joined the departments set up with the income of edowments donated by Palit and Ghosh and began their work in Science with whatever apparatus available in India and soon made their mark in their chosen fields. Palit Chairs in Physics and Chemistry and Ghosh Chairs in Applied Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics and Botany were soon filled up after the formal establishment of the University College of Science and Technology in March 1914.<ref name=\"insa.nic.in\"/>\n\n===Keys to the Start of Outstanding Research in \"Non-Colonial\" Science in Colonial India===\n\nThe establishment of Chairs in Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics, Zoology and Botany was the start of outstanding research and teaching by dedicated Indian Scientists. [[Asutosh Mookerjee|Sir Asutosh Mookerjee]] who became the first president of the first session of the Indian Science Congress at Calcutta, where nearly a hundred scientist met in 26 January 1914, took great care to identify the right talent for the right post from different parts of India in science as in humanities and was able to attribute to the \"University College of Science and Technology\" as a true national character. No nation could live solely upon the achievements of its past or upon its borrowing from others, and at the same time hoped to retain its place among the great people of the Earth. Besides advancing the frontiers of knowledge, the work by the Indian Scientists at the University College of Science and Technology not only helped in increasing the wealth of the country but also succeeded in drawing attention of the scientific world. The dedication and devotion with which the Indian Scientists at the University College of Science and Technology began their work to explain the many unknown phenomena can only remind us of the zeal and enthusiasm with which William Jones and his choice band of thirty elite Englishmen in 1783-84 had began their investigations into \"the history and antiquities, arts, sciences and literature of Asia.\"\n\nDespite the fact that the University College of Science and Technology was a department of Calcutta University set up as a part of the colonial educational despatch of 1854. there had been no substantial financial support from the British Raj to encourage the Indian Scientists in their works presumably under the idea that Indian brains were not suitable for scientific research despite great promise shown by [[Jagadish Chandra Bose]] and [[Prafulla Chandra Ray]] at the [[Presidency College]] years before the foundation of the University College of Science and Technology. Of the total expenditure of rupees 18, 13, 959 of the University College of Science and Technology between March 1914 and March 1922, the Government of India's contributions from public funds was a meagre rupees 1, 20, 000 only. Yet in spite of these financial contraints and difficulties none of the scientists left for better position in imperial organisations. Instead classic example was provided by [[Prafulla Chandra Ray]] who when re-appointed Palit Professor for 5 years after reaching the age of superannuation donated his full monthly salary for the entire period for the special benefit of his department which was \"proud to acknowledge him as its leader\". During this difficult time, there had  been \"a steady output of original work rapidly increasing in volume and improving in quality which emanated not from one or two extraordinarily isolated or exceptionally gifted workers blessed with special advantages and facilities, but from a large body of able and devoted scholars\". No doubt, the scientists at the University College of Science and Technology sowed the sowed the seeds of many a promissing project which were to bear fruits in the post-independence years. The University College of Science and Technology was indeed as oasis of scienctific research in India since 1914.<ref name=\"insa.nic.in\"/>\n \n[[Sir C.V. Raman]], A Palit Professor of Sc. College made this revolutionary discovery on the \"Scattering of Light\" which is known as [[Raman Effect|The Raman Effect]]. He announced his discovery on February 28, 1928 and was awarded the Noble Prize in Physics, the day widely celebrated as [[National Science Day|the National Science Day]] in India.
