The greater the number of immunized individuals, the less likely an outbreak can occur because there are fewer susceptible contacts. In epidemiology, herd immunity is known as a ''dependent happening'' because it influences transmission over time. As a pathogen that confers immunity to the survivors moves through a susceptible population, the number of susceptible contacts declines.

The greater the number of immunized individuals, the less likely an outbreak can occur because there are fewer susceptible contacts. In epidemiology, herd immunity is known as a ''dependent happening'' because it influences transmission over time. As a pathogen that confers immunity to the survivors moves through a susceptible population, the number of susceptible contacts declines. Even if susceptible individuals remain, their contacts are likely to be immunized, preventing any further spread of the infection.<ref name=\"Kenneth J.

The murder was committed by Evseev in the city of Zagorsk (now [[Sergiyev Posad]]) on August 25, 1974. The following day, Evseev killed 66-year-old chef Gennady Kuzmin, stabbing him with a knife several times near the [[Odintsovo]] railway station, then robbed the corpse and threw him into a roadside ditch. Evseev stole money and a grocery order that was scarce in Soviet times - a broiler chicken and three kilograms of [[Bulgaria]]n peaches. On suspicion of committing these crimes in the [[Kemerovo Oblast]], 19-year-old Sergei Savelyev, who [[Desertion|deserted]] on the eve of the first murder from the military unit, was arrested, but he failed to prove his involvement, despite the fact that he confessed to the murder of Morozova.\n\nIn September 1974, in Moscow, in the park of the Palace of Culture named after the [[Third International]], Evseev attacked student Vladimir Parshin, inflicting 4 knife wounds on him, but he survived. On September 24, 1974, in Moscow, in a house near the [[Dobryninskaya]] metro station, Evseev made a robbery attack on Anna Astafyeva. Despite being on the verge of life and death, she was able to describe the killer; according to her, the killer was a young man with sideburns and kind eyes. Soon after, the woman died in hospital.\n\nOn September 26, at the 43rd kilometer station in the Moscow Oblast, Evseev attacked a man and seriously injured him. When attacking, the killer broke his knife and the blade was left stuck in the victim's back, who died later in hospital. The murdered man, who looked very similar to Evseev, was 42-year-old Nikolai Dyomin, who had spent almost 20 years in prison. As it later turned out, Evseev committed the murder with the aim of confusing the tracks by putting his clothes on the man. Initially, the investigators even thought it was Dyomin who committed all the robberies and murders.\n\nOn October 8, 1974, in the [[Tagansky District]] of Moscow, Evseev made 3 robbery attacks at once. Two of the three women robbed by him died from the knife wounds, and all of them wore red dresses. Panic began in Moscow, with people saying that the \"Killer of women in red\" had appeared. On October 15, in the area of the [[Akademicheskaya (Moscow Metro)|Akademicheskaya]] metro station, at intervals of 20 minutes, Evseev committed 2 more attacks on girls, one of them dying from the wounds received. On October 16, in the area of the [[Proletarskaya (Moscow Metro)|Proletarskaya]] metro station, Evseev again made a double attack, killing one of the victims. But this time both victims were not wearing red clothes (thus, the version that the killer who hunted for women in red was not confirmed).\n\nAfter this, Evseev committed a series of robberies in Moscow and the surrounding region, but all victims survived and described the killer the same way. In connection with the panic in Moscow, the leadership of the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs of the USSR]] decided on unprecedented measures, the Minister of Internal Affairs [[Nikolai Shchelokov]] spoke on television, warning the citizens to be cautious. This frightened Evseev, who stopped his attacks for almost 2 years.\n\nIn November 1976, Evseev committed 4 robberies in a month, 2 of which ended in murder. In the fall of 1977, Evseev hit the secretary-typist of the [[Central Committee of the CPSU]] Nina Dalinjan on the head with a screwdriver, but she miraculously survived. The apotheosis of the criminal activity of the killer was the brutal murder of Lydia Kupriyanova, the wife of Soviet artist {{ill|Mikhail Kupriyanov (artist)|ru|\u041a\u0443\u043f\u0440\u0438\u044f\u043d\u043e\u0432, \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0438\u043b \u0412\u0430\u0441\u0438\u043b\u044c\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447|lt=Mikhail Kupriyanov|vertical-align=sup}}, member of famous artist trio known as \"[[Kukryniksy]]\". This time, for the first time, the killer raped the victim posthumously. Two months later, on December 19, 1977, in front of dozens of people in the backyard of the \"Housewares\" store in the village of Sofrino, he committed another murder. He took the watch, money, jewelry and a dog collar from the murdered Lydia Schur, raping her corpse afterwards.\n\n=== Arrest, trial and sentence ===\nA witness to the last murder reported that he had seen a suspicious man in a corduroy jacket at the crime scene. The local drinking company said that with them appeared a certain Shahnov, dressed in the velvet jacket. The jacket, on which there were blood stains and a knife was in one of the pockets, was later found. However, when Shahnov was arrested, he reported that another man had given him that jacket, with subsequent examination confirming the man's testimony. Another witness said that he had seen a stranger on a train in Khotkovo, and that he was wearing a railwayman's uniform. When the database was picked up and according to it were selected suitable matches, 22-year-old criminal Andrei Evseev came up as a result.\n\nOn December 28, 1977 the killer was arrested. On this day he had dressed the [[New Years]] tree with jewels stolen from the victims. When they came for him, he hid the jewels, and there was nothing suspicious in Evseev's apartment, except for the dog collar stolen from the last victim. He explained that he kept it hidden as a memory of his beloved dog. At first he refused to give evidence, but on December 31, on [[New Year's Eve]], while conversing with a cellmate, he dropped a strange phrase: \"My mother, I suppose, already baked pies with jewels.\" The cellmate turned out to be an informant, and the investigators guessed that the stolen jewelry was hidden in a bag of flour. The conjecture was confirmed during the second search of Evseev's apartment.\n\nDuring the interrogations, Evseev was defiant and refused to communicate with the female investigator. He agreed to testify only after he was brought salted herring, which he ate entirely with bones. Subsequently, he confessed to 9 murders, 18 attempted murders, one rape and 32 [[Brigandage|robberies]].\n\nAs a result of [[Forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatric]] examination Evseev was declared as mentally competent to stand trial, but at the same time diagnosed with \"[[Antisocial personality disorder|sociopathy]]\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.murders.ru/USSR_serial_killer_history_7.html|title=\"\u0421\u043e\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0437\u043c \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438\u2026\"|last=\u0410. \u0418. \u0420\u0430\u043a\u0438\u0442\u0438\u043d.|date=2008\u20132009|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/67PVUYVFK?url=http://www.murders.ru/USSR_serial_killer_history_5.html|archive-date=May 4, 2012|access-date=September 29, 2010}}</ref> While waiting for the court, Evseev took care about himself, and did exercises every morning.

Initially, the investigators even thought it was Dyomin who committed all the robberies and murders.\n\nOn October 8, 1974, in the [[Tagansky District]] of Moscow, Evseev made 3 robbery attacks at once. Two of the three women robbed by him died from the knife wounds, and all of them wore red dresses. Panic began in Moscow, with people saying that the \"Killer of women in red\" had appeared. On October 15, in the area of the [[Akademicheskaya (Moscow Metro)|Akademicheskaya]] metro station, at intervals of 20 minutes, Evseev committed 2 more attacks on girls, one of them dying from the wounds received. On October 16, in the area of the [[Proletarskaya (Moscow Metro)|Proletarskaya]] metro station, Evseev again made a double attack, killing one of the victims. But this time both victims were not wearing red clothes (thus, the version that the killer who hunted for women in red was not confirmed).\n\nAfter this, Evseev committed a series of robberies in Moscow and the surrounding region, but all victims survived and described the killer the same way. In connection with the panic in Moscow, the leadership of the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs of the USSR]] decided on unprecedented measures, the Minister of Internal Affairs [[Nikolai Shchelokov]] spoke on television, warning the citizens to be cautious. This frightened Evseev, who stopped his attacks for almost 2 years.\n\nIn November 1976, Evseev committed 4 robberies in a month, 2 of which ended in murder. In the fall of 1977, Evseev hit the secretary-typist of the [[Central Committee of the CPSU]] Nina Dalinjan on the head with a screwdriver, but she miraculously survived. The apotheosis of the criminal activity of the killer was the brutal murder of Lydia Kupriyanova, the wife of Soviet artist {{ill|Mikhail Kupriyanov (artist)|ru|\u041a\u0443\u043f\u0440\u0438\u044f\u043d\u043e\u0432, \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0438\u043b \u0412\u0430\u0441\u0438\u043b\u044c\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447|lt=Mikhail Kupriyanov|vertical-align=sup}}, member of famous artist trio known as \"[[Kukryniksy]]\". This time, for the first time, the killer raped the victim posthumously. Two months later, on December 19, 1977, in front of dozens of people in the backyard of the \"Housewares\" store in the village of Sofrino, he committed another murder. He took the watch, money, jewelry and a dog collar from the murdered Lydia Schur, raping her corpse afterwards.\n\n=== Arrest, trial and sentence ===\nA witness to the last murder reported that he had seen a suspicious man in a corduroy jacket at the crime scene. The local drinking company said that with them appeared a certain Shahnov, dressed in the velvet jacket. The jacket, on which there were blood stains and a knife was in one of the pockets, was later found. However, when Shahnov was arrested, he reported that another man had given him that jacket, with subsequent examination confirming the man's testimony. Another witness said that he had seen a stranger on a train in Khotkovo, and that he was wearing a railwayman's uniform. When the database was picked up and according to it were selected suitable matches, 22-year-old criminal Andrei Evseev came up as a result.\n\nOn December 28, 1977 the killer was arrested. On this day he had dressed the [[New Years]] tree with jewels stolen from the victims. When they came for him, he hid the jewels, and there was nothing suspicious in Evseev's apartment, except for the dog collar stolen from the last victim. He explained that he kept it hidden as a memory of his beloved dog. At first he refused to give evidence, but on December 31, on [[New Year's Eve]], while conversing with a cellmate, he dropped a strange phrase: \"My mother, I suppose, already baked pies with jewels.\" The cellmate turned out to be an informant, and the investigators guessed that the stolen jewelry was hidden in a bag of flour. The conjecture was confirmed during the second search of Evseev's apartment.\n\nDuring the interrogations, Evseev was defiant and refused to communicate with the female investigator. He agreed to testify only after he was brought salted herring, which he ate entirely with bones. Subsequently, he confessed to 9 murders, 18 attempted murders, one rape and 32 [[Brigandage|robberies]].\n\nAs a result of [[Forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatric]] examination Evseev was declared as mentally competent to stand trial, but at the same time diagnosed with \"[[Antisocial personality disorder|sociopathy]]\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.murders.ru/USSR_serial_killer_history_7.html|title=\"\u0421\u043e\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0437\u043c \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438\u2026\"|last=\u0410. \u0418. \u0420\u0430\u043a\u0438\u0442\u0438\u043d.|date=2008\u20132009|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/67PVUYVFK?url=http://www.murders.ru/USSR_serial_killer_history_5.html|archive-date=May 4, 2012|access-date=September 29, 2010}}</ref> While waiting for the court, Evseev took care about himself, and did exercises every morning.
