It is known to be rapidly developing since it offers easy connectivity to [[Mumbai]], [[Thane]], and [[Navi Mumbai]] and is today known as one of the fastest growing areas of the city.<ref name=\"Advantage Mira Road\" />\n\n==History==\nThe rise of Mumbai's [[real estate]] prices has been instrumental in the development of the Mira-Bhayandar region. From 1947 onwards, primarily developed by Bharat Shah the rise in [[real estate]] prices prompted several largely middle-income families to migrate to the suburbs of Mumbai like [[Virar]], [[Vasai]] and [[Nalasopara]]. At that time, the Mira-Bhayandar area was part of a [[Gram Panchayat]] and was consisted primarily of [[Agriculture|agricultural]] land, majorly rice. This delayed and deterred builders from starting development projects.<ref name=\"Advantage Mira Road\">\n{{cite web\n| title = Advantage Mira Road!\n| url = http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/mumbai/Advantage-Mira-Road/articleshow/1023603.cms\n| newspaper = [[The Times of India]]\n| publication-date = 18 February 2005\n| access-date = 31 October 2017 \n}}\n</ref> By 1980, builders began to buy agricultural land and start developing townships.

[[Gilbert Mendonca]] was elected as the first president of the Mira-Bhayandar Municipal Council. \n\nAs it is located very close to the city, with easy accessibility by road as well as railway, and facilities for the city also extending to this town, have resulted in an increase in population and Mira Bhayandar as a whole, developed further. \n\nThe [[Municipal council|Municipal Council]] later on 28 February 2002, was changed to a [[Municipal corporation|Municipal Corporation]] due to its large population and had its first elected mayor Smt. Maira Mendonca on 11 August. Mira Road and its neighbouring suburb [[Bhayandar]] began emerging as a fast developing suburb and experienced economic development mainly due to its manufacturing sector.

It is known to be rapidly developing since it offers easy connectivity to [[Mumbai]], [[Thane]], and [[Navi Mumbai]] and is today known as one of the fastest growing areas of the city.<ref name=\"Advantage Mira Road\" />\n\n==History==\nThe rise of Mumbai's [[real estate]] prices has been instrumental in the development of the Mira-Bhayandar region. From 1947 onwards, primarily developed by Bharat Shah the rise in [[real estate]] prices prompted several largely middle-income families to migrate to the suburbs of Mumbai like [[Virar]], [[Vasai]] and [[Nalasopara]]. At that time, the Mira-Bhayandar area was part of a [[Gram Panchayat]] and was consisted primarily of [[Agriculture|agricultural]] land, majorly rice. This delayed and deterred builders from starting development projects.<ref name=\"Advantage Mira Road\">\n{{cite web\n| title = Advantage Mira Road!\n| url = http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/mumbai/Advantage-Mira-Road/articleshow/1023603.cms\n| newspaper = [[The Times of India]]\n| publication-date = 18 February 2005\n| access-date = 31 October 2017 \n}}\n</ref> By 1980, builders began to buy agricultural land and start developing townships.

Shri.

Maira Mendonca on 11 August.
