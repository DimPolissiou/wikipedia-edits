It was first screened on June 10, 1895.\n\nIt is the earliest known instance of film [[comedy]], the first use of film to portray a [[fiction]]al story, and the first use of a promotional [[film poster]]. The film was originally known as '''''Le Jardinier''''' (\"The Gardener\") or '''''Le Jardinier et le petit espi\u00e8gle''''', and is sometimes referred to in English as '''''The Tables Turned on the Gardener''''', and '''''The Sprinkler Sprinkled'''''.\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Le Jardinier (l'Arroseur arros\u00e9) (1895).webm|left|thumb|''L'Arroseur Arros\u00e9 '', 1895]]\nShot in [[Lyon]] in the spring of 1895, the film portrays a simple practical joke in which a [[gardener]] is tormented by a boy who steps on the [[Garden hose|hose]] that the gardener is using to water his plants, cutting off the water flow. When the gardener tilts the nozzle up to inspect it, the boy releases the hose, causing the water to spray him. The gardener is stunned and his hat is knocked off, but he soon catches on. A chase ensues, both on and off-screen (the camera never moves from its original position) until the gardener catches the boy and administers a [[spanking]]. The entire film lasts only 45 seconds, but this simple bit of [[slapstick]] may be the forerunner of all subsequent film comedy.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/Films-Am-Aw/L-Arroseur-Arrose.html|title=L'Arroseur Arrose \u2013 Film (Movie) Plot and Review \u2013 Publications|website=www.filmreference.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-01}}</ref>  The 1896 film version replaces the boy with a teenager and the spanking action is substituted with a kick in the rump.\n\n==Production==\nIn the earliest years of the [[history of film]], the cinema was used by pioneers such as [[Thomas Edison]] and the Lumi\u00e8res to entertain by the sheer novelty of the invention, and most films were short recordings of mundane events, such as a [[Fred Ott's Sneeze|sneeze]], or the [[L'Arriv\u00e9e d'un train en gare de La Ciotat|arrival of a train]]. Ever seeking to innovate, the Lumi\u00e8res took some of the first steps toward [[narrative]] film with ''L'Arroseur arros\u00e9''. Given the [[Documentary film|documentary]] nature of existing films up until this point, a scripted, comedic film shown among these was unexpected by an audience, enhancing its comedic surprise value.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nIt was filmed by means of the [[Cin\u00e9matographe]], an all-in-one camera, which also serves as a film projector and developer. As with all early Lumi\u00e8re movies, this film was made in a [[35mm movie film|35 mm format]] with an [[Aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] of 1.33:1.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0000014/technical |title=Technical Specifications |work=Internet Movie Database |accessdate=2007-03-28 }}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\nLouis Lumi\u00e8re used his own gardener, Fran\u00e7ois Clerc, to portray the gardener.

The film was originally known as '''''Le Jardinier''''' (\"The Gardener\") or '''''Le Jardinier et le petit espi\u00e8gle''''', and is sometimes referred to in English as '''''The Tables Turned on the Gardener''''', and '''''The Sprinkler Sprinkled'''''.\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Le Jardinier (l'Arroseur arros\u00e9) (1895).webm|left|thumb|''L'Arroseur Arros\u00e9 '', 1895]]\nShot in [[Lyon]] in the spring of 1895, the film portrays a simple practical joke in which a [[gardener]] is tormented by a boy who steps on the [[Garden hose|hose]] that the gardener is using to water his plants, cutting off the water flow. When the gardener tilts the nozzle up to inspect it, the boy releases the hose, causing the water to spray him. The gardener is stunned and his hat is knocked off, but he soon catches on. A chase ensues, both on and off-screen (the camera never moves from its original position) until the gardener catches the boy and administers a [[spanking]]. The entire film lasts only 45 seconds, but this simple bit of [[slapstick]] may be the forerunner of all subsequent film comedy.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/Films-Am-Aw/L-Arroseur-Arrose.html|title=L'Arroseur Arrose \u2013 Film (Movie) Plot and Review \u2013 Publications|website=www.filmreference.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-01}}</ref>  The 1896 film version replaces the boy with a teenager and the spanking action is substituted with a kick in the rump.\n\n==Production==\nIn the earliest years of the [[history of film]], the cinema was used by pioneers such as [[Thomas Edison]] and the Lumi\u00e8res to entertain by the sheer novelty of the invention, and most films were short recordings of mundane events, such as a [[Fred Ott's Sneeze|sneeze]], or the [[L'Arriv\u00e9e d'un train en gare de La Ciotat|arrival of a train]]. Ever seeking to innovate, the Lumi\u00e8res took some of the first steps toward [[narrative]] film with ''L'Arroseur arros\u00e9''. Given the [[Documentary film|documentary]] nature of existing films up until this point, a scripted, comedic film shown among these was unexpected by an audience, enhancing its comedic surprise value.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nIt was filmed by means of the [[Cin\u00e9matographe]], an all-in-one camera, which also serves as a film projector and developer. As with all early Lumi\u00e8re movies, this film was made in a [[35mm movie film|35 mm format]] with an [[Aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] of 1.33:1.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0000014/technical |title=Technical Specifications |work=Internet Movie Database |accessdate=2007-03-28 }}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\nLouis Lumi\u00e8re used his own gardener, Fran\u00e7ois Clerc, to portray the gardener.

If one looks solely at music that is created by non-anonymous musicians who use sophisticated musical styles, it is possible to view many artists from different cultures as fitting into the kindie realm. Most of the prominent kids' musicians from around the world use European-influenced music styles, although many artists from Latin America include locally influenced music as well.\n\n=== Europe ===\nThere is not a large number of widely known kindie artists from Europe. ''[https://www.youtube.com/lalibegood Lali BeGood]'' (Barcelona, Spain) is one of the most interesting kindie artists who began to be international in 2020. Her band has been selected to perform in the '''Kindiecomm 2020 Showcase'''. They have also played in Berlin and Hamburg early this year. Her new album [https://open.spotify.com/album/7g9tVLFjZHKUWGL4gBgFKx?si=_20fs2d8QY6P8hjDnNHA3g Future-Oh!] (english-spanish version) has been released in early February.\n\nWith her wolf ears and ukulele always ready, she is a vibrant, unpredictable and genuine singer-songwriter with songs and stories based on contemporary values to help form more conscious adults to redefine the world. Known for her ability to write smart, humorous lyrics that both parents and children can relate to, she deals with topics such as the arrival of a little brother, the love for animals and nature, a transhuman future, first love, night-time fears, school stereotypes, and even the death of a loved one. Her love'n'roll (as she calls it) is a non-infantilized and personal approach to creating music and talking to adults and children alike. Her best-known song in Spain [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCNskuvi0ng '''The Secret Life of an Ant'''] is now on Youtube in english version, the theme combines sensitivity and humor in defense of life in all its forms.\n\n=== Latin America ===\nThere are many different children's music scenes throughout Latin America, encompassing Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, and Mexico, to name some of the most prominent. A notable feature of Latin American kindie music, unlike artists from the United States, Europe, or Oceania, is the prevalence of musical theater as a format for their concerts.{{Citation needed|reason=I haven't yet tracked down a good source which mentions this specifically, although I know from experience that the majority of Latin American kindie artists produce musical theater.|date=July 2019}}\n\n=== Oceania ===\nAustralia has a popular and internationally recognized kindie scene, although there are not as many artists in Australia as in other countries.

If one looks solely at music that is created by non-anonymous musicians who use sophisticated musical styles, it is possible to view many artists from different cultures as fitting into the kindie realm. Most of the prominent kids' musicians from around the world use European-influenced music styles, although many artists from Latin America include locally influenced music as well.\n\n=== Europe ===\nThere is not a large number of widely known kindie artists from Europe. ''[https://www.youtube.com/lalibegood Lali BeGood]'' (Barcelona, Spain) is one of the most interesting kindie artists that beguns to be international this 2020. Her band has been selected to perform in the '''Kindiecomm 2020 Showcase'''. They have also played in Berlin and Hamburg early this year. Her new album [https://open.spotify.com/album/7g9tVLFjZHKUWGL4gBgFKx?si=_20fs2d8QY6P8hjDnNHA3g Future-Oh!] (english-spanish version) has been released in early February.\n\nWith her wolf ears and ukulele always ready, she is a vibrant, unpredictable and genuine singer-songwriter with songs and stories based on contemporary values to help form more conscious adults to redefine the world. Known for her ability to write smart, humorous lyrics that both parents and children can relate to, she deals with topics such as the arrival of a little brother, the love for animals and nature, a transhuman future, first love, night-time fears, school stereotypes, and even the death of a loved one. Her love'n'roll (as she calls it) is a non-infantilized and personal approach to creating music and talking to adults and children alike. Her best-known song in Spain [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCNskuvi0ng '''The Secret Life of an Ant'''] is now on Youtube in english version, the theme combines sensitivity and humor in defense of life in all its forms.\n\n=== Latin America ===\nThere are many different children's music scenes throughout Latin America, encompassing Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, and Mexico, to name some of the most prominent. A notable feature of Latin American kindie music, unlike artists from the United States, Europe, or Oceania, is the prevalence of musical theater as a format for their concerts.{{Citation needed|reason=I haven't yet tracked down a good source which mentions this specifically, although I know from experience that the majority of Latin American kindie artists produce musical theater.|date=July 2019}}\n\n=== Oceania ===\nAustralia has a popular and internationally recognized kindie scene, although there are not as many artists in Australia as in other countries. There are also many artists from New Zealand, which are gaining international recognition in both hemispheres.{{cn|date=July 2019}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://playtimeplaylist.com/ Playtime Playlist, a database of new kindie music releases]\n* [http://www.zooglobble.com/ Zooglobble, a blog about kindie music]\n\n[[Category:Children's music]]\n[[Category:Rock music genres]]\n", "name_user": "Fandelasketchup", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eInternational kindie music", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kindie_rock"}

H. Auden]]'s famous poem \"[[Mus\u00e9e des Beaux Arts (poem)|Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts]]\", named after the museum in Brussels which holds the painting, and became the subject of a [[Landscape with the Fall of Icarus (poem)|poem of the same name]] by [[William Carlos Williams]], as well as \"Lines on Bruegel's 'Icarus'\" by [[Michael Hamburger]].<ref>Rico, 19 (gives text)</ref>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Fall of Icarus - Brueghel -Museum van Buuren.jpg|thumb|left|''Landscape with The Fall of Icarus'', ca. 1590\u201395, oil  on wood ({{convert|63|x|90|cm}}), Circle of P. Bruegel the Elder, [[Museum van Buuren]], Brussels, Belgium]]\n\nIn [[Greek mythology]], [[Icarus]] succeeded in flying, with wings made by his father [[Daedalus]], using feathers secured with [[bees wax]].  Ignoring his father's warnings, Icarus chose to fly too close to the sun, melting the wax, and fell into the sea and drowned. His legs can be seen in the water just below the ship. The sun, already half-set on the horizon, is a long way away; the flight did not reach anywhere near it. Daedalus does not appear in this version of the painting, though he does, still flying, in the van Buuren one (see below).\n\nThe ploughman, shepherd and angler are mentioned in Ovid's account of the legend; they are: \"astonished and think to see gods approaching them through the aether\",<ref name=hag60/> which is not entirely the impression given in the painting. The shepherd gazing into the air, away from the ship, may be explained by another version of the composition (see below); in the original work there was probably also a figure of Daedalus in the sky to the left, at which he stares.  There is also a Flemish [[proverb]] (of the sort imaged in other works by Bruegel): \"And the farmer continued to plough...\" (En de boer ... hij ploegde voort\") pointing out the ignorance of people to fellow men's suffering.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://traumwerk.stanford.edu/philolog/2005/11/ekphrasis_ovid_in_pieter_breug.html |title=Ekphrasis or Not?

Other landscapes by Bruegel, for example ''[[The Hunters in the Snow]]'' (1565) and others in that series of paintings showing the seasons, show genre figures in a raised foreground, but not so large relative to the size of the image, nor with a subject from a \"higher\" class of painting in the background.  \n\nHowever, paintings from the same period by the Antwerp artist [[Pieter Aertsen]] had large kitchen or market genre scenes, with large figures in the foreground, and in the distant background a glimpse of a scene from the [[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]].  Giving more prominence to \"low\" subject-matter than \"high\" in the same work is a feature of some [[Northern Mannerist]] art, often called \"Mannerist inversion\".  The traditional moral of the Icarus story, warning against excessive ambition, is reinforced by (literally) fore-grounding humbler figures who appear content to fill useful agricultural roles in life.<ref>Hagen, Rose-Marie and Rainer; ''What Great Paintings Say'', vol 1, 265, 2005, 2 vols, Taschen, {{ISBN|9783822847909}}</ref>\n\n==Attribution==\n[[File:Der Sturz des Ikarus (Ausschnitt).jpg|thumb|Icarus and the angler]]\nThe painting is probably a version of a lost original by Bruegel.

H. Auden]]'s famous poem \"[[Mus\u00e9e des Beaux Arts (poem)|Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts]]\", named after the museum in Brussels which holds the painting, and became the subject of a [[Landscape with the Fall of Icarus (poem)|poem of the same name]] by [[William Carlos Williams]], as well as \"Lines on Bruegel's 'Icarus'\" by [[Michael Hamburger]].<ref>Rico, 19 (gives text)</ref>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Fall of Icarus - Brueghel -Museum van Buuren.jpg|thumb|left|''Landscape with The Fall of Icarus'', ca. 1590\u201395, oil  on wood ({{convert|63|x|90|cm}}), Circle of P. Bruegel the Elder, [[Museum van Buuren]], Brussels, Belgium]]\n\nIn [[Greek mythology]], [[Icarus]] succeeded in flying, with wings made by his father [[Daedalus]], using feathers secured with [[bees wax]].  Ignoring his father's warnings, Icarus chose to fly too close to the sun, melting the wax, and fell into the sea and drowned. His legs can be seen in the water just below the ship. The sun, already half-set on the horizon, is a long way away; the flight did not reach anywhere near it. Daedalus does not appear in this version of the painting, though he does, still flying, in the van Buuren one (see below).\n\nThe ploughman, shepherd and angler are mentioned in Ovid's account of the legend; they are: \"astonished and think to see gods approaching them through the aether\",<ref name=hag60/> which is not entirely the impression given in the painting. The shepherd gazing into the air, away from the ship, may be explained by another version of the composition (see below); in the original work there was probably also a figure of Daedalus in the sky to the left, at which he stares.  There is also a Flemish [[proverb]] (of the sort imaged in other works by Bruegel): \"And the farmer continued to plough...\" (En de boer ... hij ploegde voort\") pointing out the ignorance of people to fellow men's suffering.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://traumwerk.stanford.edu/philolog/2005/11/ekphrasis_ovid_in_pieter_breug.html |title=Ekphrasis or Not?

Other landscapes by Bruegel, for example ''[[The Hunters in the Snow]]'' (1565) and others in that series of paintings showing the seasons, show genre figures in a raised foreground, but not so large relative to the size of the image, nor with a subject from a \"higher\" class of painting in the background.  \n\nHowever, paintings from the same period by the Antwerp artist [[Pieter Aertsen]] had large kitchen or market genre scenes, with large figures in the foreground, and in the distant background a glimpse of a scene from the [[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]].  Giving more prominence to \"low\" subject-matter than \"high\" in the same work is a feature of some [[Northern Mannerist]] art, often called \"Mannerist inversion\".  The traditional moral of the Icarus story, warning against excessive ambition, is reinforced by (literally) fore-grounding humbler figures who appear content to fill useful agricultural roles in life.<ref>Hagen, Rose-Marie and Rainer; ''What Great Paintings Say'', vol 1, 265, 2005, 2 vols, Taschen, {{ISBN|9783822847909}}</ref>\n\n==Attribution==\n[[File:Der Sturz des Ikarus (Ausschnitt).jpg|thumb|Icarus and the angler]]\nThe painting is probably a version of a lost original by Bruegel.
