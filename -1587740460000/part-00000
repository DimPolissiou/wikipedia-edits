{"title_page": "Quiz League of London", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=January 2019}}\n\n'''The Quiz League of London''' ('''QLL''') is a British [[quiz league]] based in [[London]]. Founded in 1990 as the ''Quiz League of South London'', it was [[southern England]]'s first independent self-administered quiz league. The matches themselves are mostly hosted at [[pub]]s or [[social club]]s.\n\n==History==\nThe QLL has since incorporated many teams from the [[Greater London]] area, and currently (2019\u201320) has two divisions of ten teams each plus sixteen teams in division three split into two conferences of eight teams each. The QLL runs the annual London Open Quiz Festival, which features a knockout competition between other quiz leagues from up and down the country and an annual open buzzer quiz using the [[University Challenge]] format. The QLL also runs a President's Cup league competition aimed at the top players, a Summer Friendly League designed to be a bit less challenging, a knockout Cup and Plate competition, the Brain of London (an individual competition using the MIMIR format), a charity night, and a summer social. Players in the QLL include previous [[Mastermind (TV series)|Mastermind]], [[Brain of Britain]], and [[Only Connect]] winners and other television and radio quiz winners. The only founder member clubs of the original four teams extant in the QLL are the Accies (original name being Jimmy Hill Club).<ref>http://www.quizleagueoflondon.co.uk/teams/team.aspx?ID=16</ref> and Atletico (original name being Manor Arms).<ref>http://www.quizleagueoflondon.co.uk/teams/team.aspx?ID=4</ref>\n\n==Team format==\nTwo teams, one home, one away play each other, responding orally to a questionmaster.\n\n[[Image:MQL team positions.png|right|250px|thumb|Positions for a typical league quiz played in the QLL, SK=Scorekeeper, QM=Question master, TK=timekeeper]]\n\nThe QLL format consists of 64 questions in 8 rounds of 8 questions each asked to individuals on the teams alternately. Correctly answering your own question scores 2 points though it can be passed within the team (if the player chooses not to answer) or over to the other team (if the player or team answer wrongly or choose not to answer) for one point.\n\nIn the QLL format, there is no conferring as such. Where a player decides not to answer their question, the team captain will normally decide which other member of the team is to answer. The opposition will also decide who is to answer the question in the event of it being passed over. After 4 rounds, the order of answering changes so the team who began round 1 going first begin round 5 going second. This is done by switching each team's questions from A to B or from B to A depending on which questions they started with.\n\nIn league competitions, a win scores four points, a draw scores two points and a close defeat (losing by three points or fewer) scores one point. In addition, if all four members of a team get all of their own questions correct in any given round (a \"full house\"), an additional bonus point is scored.\n\nIn knockout competitions where a draw is not permitted, an additional ninth round of questions is played. If the scores are still tied at the end of the ninth round, a tie-breaker is played.\n\n==Individual format==\n[[Image:MIMIR individual positions.png|right|180px|thumb|Positions for a typical individual quiz played in the QLL, SK=Scorekeeper, QM=Question master, BC=Bonus counter]]\n\nMany quiz leagues run individual competitions. QLL's uses the MIMIR quiz format (named after [[M\u00edmir]], a god of [[Norse mythology]] who was renowned for his knowledge and wisdom). Matches are played in groups of four with positions drawn at random and each person has 3 questions addressed to them, in each of 5 rounds.\n\nTime to answer is at the discretion of the question master but a wrong answer or a pass gives any of the other three an opportunity to score a bonus point. The decision as to who gets the first chance to answer for a bonus is determined by offering the question to whoever, at that stage, has made fewest attempts to gain bonus points or, if there is more than one player who has made the fewest bonus attempts, the next player in line (e.g. if this happened on the first question, P2 would have the first option on a bonus attempt). As well as a scorekeeper, a bonus counter is needed to track each player's bonus attempts.\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Pub quiz]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.quizleagueoflondon.co.uk The Quiz League of London]\n*[http://www.abql.org.uk/ The Association of British Quiz Leagues]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Quiz League of London}}\n[[Category:Quiz games]]\n[[Category:British culture]]\n[[Category:Pub games]]\n[[Category:Organizations established in 1990]]\n[[Category:1990 establishments in England]]\n[[Category:Organisations based in London]]\n", "text_old": "{{Refimprove|date=January 2019}}\n\n'''The Quiz League of London''' (QLL) is a British [[quiz league]] based in [[London]].

It originally aired on July 24, 2002. This episode mocks [[moral panic]]s, and was the last to feature [[Tweek Tweak|Tweek]] as the \"fourth friend\" alongside Stan, Kyle and Cartman.\n\nIn the episode, the parents of South Park hire the owner and operator of the local City Wok, Mr. Tuong Lu Kim, to build a Great Wall around the city to protect their children from kidnappers. Just as Mr. Tuong Lu Kim almost finishes the wall, Mongolians arrive to try to break through. When a study reveals that nine out of ten abduction cases are committed by the mother or the father, the parents send their kids out on their own so they won't have a fear of being kidnapped by their parents.\n\nIn the summer of 2013, fans voted \"Child Abduction Is Not Funny\" as the best episode of Season 6.<ref>[http://www.southparkstudios.com/fans/summer-of-south-park/season-6 Season 6] ''Summer of South Park''</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nWith the media full of [[school shootings]], [[terrorism|terrorist]] threats and child abductions, the parents of South Park grow excessively concerned about the safety of their children. [[List of students at South Park Elementary#Tweek Tweak|Tweek]] is scared the most by the media reports, and his parents serve only to exacerbate his fears by turning their house into a virtual prison and playing cruel intellectual games with him designed by intention to increase his safety. As a result, Tweek loses his ability to empathize with others - even refusing to assist a crippled person stuck on some train tracks, who is then promptly killed by a train. After a real child abductor (pretending to be the \"Ghost of Human Kindness\") fails to kidnap Tweek, the parents of South Park are put on high alert.\n\nTaking advantage of expensive technology, the City commissions the owner of City Wok, [[List of recurring South Park characters#Tuong Lu Kim|Mr. Lu Kim]] to build a huge wall around the city similar to the [[Great Wall of China]]. Media reports continue to file in \u2014 it first convinces them they should not leave their children alone for a moment, prompting the parents to go with them anywhere they go. A later report convinces them they cannot even trust their own neighbors and family friends, forcing the parents to sever ties with each other. The kids, annoyed and embarrassed by their parents' actions, initially blame Tweek for their parents' paranoia, but soon decide that they'd have inevitably resorted to something this stupid eventually.\n\nDespite trying to avoid being a stereotype and having no experience in construction, Mr. Kim reluctantly agrees to build the wall. He builds a very impressive one single-handedly. After he is finished, a band of [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] appear out of nowhere and attack the wall because: \"Every time us Chinese put up a wall stupid Mongorianzh have to come and knock it down,\" as he puts it, in a reference to Chinese history. Although he tries desperately to rout the enemy by himself, he proves to be no match for the Mongols' increasingly clever tactics, which include redirecting a [[heat-seeking missile]] with a flaming [[baseball]] and making use of a [[Trojan Horse]] filled with sweet and sour pork. Enraged, Kim vows vengeance.\n\nMeanwhile, back within the town a news report states that the parents are most likely to abduct their own children. Blindly believing what they have been told, they send their children from the city in a tearful ceremony in order to avoid putting their children in danger of being kidnapped by their own parents. As they leave, the children wonder about how stupid their parents are sometimes.\n\nWithin the week, the children join forces with the Mongols, having apparently learned their language, and expressing anger at their parents' irresponsible and irrational behavior. The Mongols then move on the wall again, where Mr. Kim is dressed for battle. He then does his \"war dance\", but while he is doing this, the children wheel a large cart laden with explosives in behind him and blow up the wall. The parents arrive to investigate the explosion, and are reunited with their kids. They realize that they overreacted to the news stories, and that to cut themselves off from the rest of the world with the wall denies new possibilities. [[List of recurring South Park characters#Mayor McDaniels|Mayor McDaniels]] orders Mr. Lu Kim to \"[[tear down this wall]],\" angering him once more since building the wall was a waste of time. Despite the reunion, the parents believe their children have forgotten them in the short space of four days and use simple English to convince them to return home (with Stan muttering to Kyle, \"Jesus Christ, dude, they've done some stupid crap before, but Jesus Christ.\").\n\n==Production==\nAccording to the DVD commentary, the episode was done right after the creators saw the Elizabeth Smart abduction in Utah on the news. Parker and Stone came up with the line \"Goddamn Mongorianzh, no more breaking down my shitty warr!\" while on the [[Great Wall of China]] in the 1990s.<ref>{{Cite video | people=[[Trey Parker|Parker, Trey]]|date = November 2005|title=South Park: The Complete Sixth Season: \"Free Hat\" |format= |medium= DVD \u2013 audio commentary|publisher=[[Paramount Pictures#Paramount Home Entertainment|Paramount Home Entertainment]]}}</ref>\n\n==Cultural references==\nWhen Mr. Kim gets ready to shoot the heat seeking missile, he introduces it to the Mongolians saying \"Say herro to my rittre friend.\" This is a reference to the movie ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]''.

It was first aired on [[BBC Two]] on 15 May 1984.\n\n==Plot==\nThe quartet are so poor that they are burning their clothes and belongings just to keep warm. Neil prepares meals of snow passed off as [[risotto]], and Vyvyan goes around the neighbourhood to find winter fuel although the episode is set in September. Eventually they decide that someone needs to get a job to bring money into the house, but when the only vacancy advertised in the local paper is for the Army, Rick and Mike both rule themselves out on medical grounds (perforated [[eardrum]] and flat feet, respectively), while Vyvyan declares that he is [[pregnant]], leaving Neil the only one to take the job.\n\nAfter a poor [[haircut]] and a quick loan of Mike's suit, Neil goes to join up, but having been told not to mention it, is rejected for being a [[pacifist]]. After spotting a recruitment poster for the police, the other three throw Neil into the police station next door, where he meets [[Alexei Sayle]]'s character, a [[Mussolini]]-lookalike. While the others get lucky when a [[lorry]] full of food and expensive furnishings crashes through the front window, Neil takes to his new job - arresting a bunch of his drugged-up hippie friends, where the track Electrick Gypsies by Steve Hillage is playing on the record player until he pulls the plug on it and says - \"Oh no, [[Steve Hillage]]!\"\n\nArriving home, Neil tries to arrest his flatmates, assuming they have stolen the luxury items. His harsh use of the [[Baton (law enforcement)|baton]] forces Vyvyan into [[Childbirth|labour]]. Mike leaves the room, being afraid of the sight of childbirth. Instead, Vyvyan actually ends up passing wind loudly. Having been handcuffed together with Vyvyan, Rick and Neil frantically try to escape the smell but Neil is unable to find the key. Unaware, Mike comes back in, and tries to light a celebratory cigar. The flame reacts with the gas, causing the house to explode.\n\n==Characters==\n\nAs with all episodes of ''The Young Ones'', the main four characters were student flatmates Mike ([[Christopher Ryan]]); Vyvyan ([[Adrian Edmondson]]); Rick ([[Rik Mayall]]) and Neil ([[Nigel Planer]]). [[Alexei Sayle]] starred as a [[Benito Mussolini]] cabaret act and police recruitment officer. DJ [[Alan Freeman]] plays God, sitting at a radio mixing desk, on the first of two occasions in the series.\n\n==Edits==\nThe episode features a performance from Ken Bishop's Nice Twelve, a one-off conglomerate of high-profile rock musicians and theme writers, including [[Jools Holland]], [[Simon Brint]], [[Stewart Copeland]] and [[Chris Difford]] performing \"[[Subterranean Homesick Blues]]\" by [[Bob Dylan]]. For contractual reasons, this was edited out of DVD releases in the past, but was reinstated for the 25th Anniversary edition.\n\nOn the original release DVDs, to go with the edit, the scenes of the main cast are cut, all bar the scene where they take Neil to the job centre. The band's name is also edited out of the credits, but rather than simply erase the name, the portion of credits with the group name is cut, with the credits before and after that intersected by a thick orange line, which also shows two sets of footage playing. However, when a total list of all cast members of all 12 episodes of the series are in the credits for \"[[Summer Holiday (The Young Ones)|Summer Holiday]]\", the names of the three musicians are not taken out.\n\nThis particular episode is unusual in that it is filmed to enable the wall with the fireplace, which would usually be 'behind camera,' to be in view during internal scenes.

Mussolini informed [[Carlo Geloso|General Carlo Geloso]] that the Ionian Islands would form a separate Italian province through a de facto annexation, but the Germans would not approve it. Nevertheless, the Italian authorities continued to prepare the ground for the annexation. Finally, on 22 April 1941, after discussions between the German and Italian rulers, Hitler agreed that Italy could proceed with a de facto annexation of the islands. Thus on 10 August 1941 the islands of [[Corfu]], [[Cephalonia]], [[Zakynthos]], [[Lefkada]] and some minor islands were officially annexed by Italy as part of the ''Grande Communit\u00e0 del Nuovo Impero Romano'' (Great Community of the New Roman Empire).\n<ref name=\"Rodogno\"/><ref>{{cite book|last1=Corvaja|first1=Santi|title=MacGregor Knox|date=2008|publisher=Enigma Books|isbn=978-1929631421|page=170}}</ref><ref name=\"Stato Maggiore Difesa\">{{cite book|last1=Commissione Italiana di Storia Militare|title=L'Italia in Guerra - Il Terzo Anno 1942|date=1993|publisher=Italian Ministry of Defense|location=Rome|page=370|url=http://www.difesa.it/Area_Storica_HTML/editoria/1993/in-guerra-III/Pagine/index.html|accessdate=5 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nAs soon as the fascist governor [[Piero Parini]] had installed himself on [[Corfu]] he vigorously began a forced Italianization policy that lasted until the end of the war.<ref name=\"Stato Maggiore Difesa\"/> The islands passed through a phase of Italianization in all areas, from their administration to their economy. Italian was designated the islands' only official language; a new currency, the Ionian drachma, was introduced with the aim to hamper trade with the rest of Greece, which was forbidden by Parini. Transportation with continental Greece was limited; in the courts, judges had to apply Italian law, and schooling followed the educational model of the Italian mainland. Greek administrative officials were replaced by Italian ones, administrative officials of non-Ionic origin were expelled, the local gendarmes were partially replaced by Italian [[Carabinieri]], although Parini initially allowed the Greek judges to continue their work, they were ultimately replaced by an Italian Military Court based in Corfu. The \"return to the Venetian order\" and the italianization as pursued by Parini were even more drastic than the italianization policies elsewhere, as their aim was a forced and abrupt cessation of all cultural and historical ties with the old mother country.

Parini reacted by opening a concentration camp on the island of [[Paxi]], to which two more camps were added on [[Othonoi]] and [[Lazaretto Island|Lazaretto]] islands. Parini's police troops arrested about 3,500 people, which were imprisoned at these three camps.<ref name=\"Stato Maggiore Difesa\"/> The Italianization efforts in the Ionian islands ended in September 1943, after the [[armistice of Cassibile]].\n\n===South Tyrol===\n{{Main|Italianization of South Tyrol}}\nIn 1919, at the time of its annexation, the southern part of [[county of Tyrol|Tyrol]] was inhabited by almost 90% [[German language|German]] speakers.<ref name=\"Provincial Statistics Institute of the Autonomous Province of South Tyrol\">Oscar Benvenuto (ed.): \"[http://www.provincia.bz.it/Astat/downloads/Siz_2008-eng.pdf South Tyrol in Figures 2008\", Provincial Statistics Institute of the Autonomous Province of South Tyrol], Bozen/Bolzano 2007, p. 19, Table 11</ref> In October 1923, the use of the Italian language became mandatory (although not exclusive) on all levels of federal, provincial and local government.<ref name=\"Steininger, 23-24\">Steininger, Rolf (2003), p. 23-24</ref> Regulations by the fascist authorities required that all kinds of signs and public notices had to be in Italian only.

The government created incentives to encourage immigration of native Italians to the South Tyrol.\n\nSeveral factors limited the effects of the Italian policy, namely the adverse nature of the territory (mainly mountains and valleys of difficult access), the difficulty for the Italians from [[southern Italy]] to adapt to a completely different environment and, later on, the alliance between [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and Italy. Under the 1939 [[South Tyrol Option Agreement]], [[Adolf Hitler]] and Benito Mussolini determined the status of the [[German people]] living in the province. They either had to opt for emigration to [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] or stay in Italy and become fully Italianized. Because of the outbreak of [[World War II]], this agreement was never fully implemented and most ethnic Germans remained or returned at the end of the war.\n\nFollowing World War II, South Tyrol was one of the first regions to be granted autonomy on the ground of the peculiar linguistic situation; any further attempts at Italianization were formerly abandoned.

The Savoyards imposed the Italian language on Sardinia as part of a wider cultural policy designed to bind the island to the Mainland in such a way as to prevent either future attempts of political separation, based on the [[Sardinian language|language]] native to the [[Sardinians|islanders]], or curb a renewed interest on the part of [[Spain]]. However, it was not until the rise of fascism that Sardinian was actively banned and/or excluded from any residual cultural activities to enforce a thorough [[language shift|shift]] to Italian.<ref>\u00abDopo pisani e genovesi si erano susseguiti aragonesi di lingua catalana, spagnoli di lingua castigliana, austriaci, piemontesi ed, infine, italiani [...] Nonostante questi impatti linguistici, la \"limba sarda\" si mantiene relativamente intatta attraverso i secoli.

Mussolini informed [[Carlo Geloso|General Carlo Geloso]] that the Ionian Islands would form a separate Italian province through a de facto annexation, but the Germans would not approve it. Nevertheless, the Italian authorities continued to prepare the ground for the annexation. Finally, on 22 April 1941, after discussions between the German and Italian rulers, Hitler agreed that Italy could proceed with a de facto annexation of the islands. Thus on 10 August 1941 the islands of [[Corfu]], [[Cephalonia]], [[Zakynthos]], [[Lefkada]] and some minor islands were officially annexed by Italy as part of the ''Grande Communit\u00e0 del Nuovo Impero Romano'' (Great Community of the New Roman Empire).\n<ref name=\"Rodogno\"/><ref>{{cite book|last1=Corvaja|first1=Santi|title=MacGregor Knox|date=2008|publisher=Enigma Books|isbn=978-1929631421|page=170}}</ref><ref name=\"Stato Maggiore Difesa\">{{cite book|last1=Commissione Italiana di Storia Militare|title=L'Italia in Guerra - Il Terzo Anno 1942|date=1993|publisher=Italian Ministry of Defense|location=Rome|page=370|url=http://www.difesa.it/Area_Storica_HTML/editoria/1993/in-guerra-III/Pagine/index.html|accessdate=5 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nAs soon as the fascist governor [[Piero Parini]] had installed himself on [[Corfu]] he vigorously began a forced Italianization policy that lasted until the end of the war.<ref name=\"Stato Maggiore Difesa\"/> The islands passed through a phase of Italianization in all areas, from their administration to their economy. Italian was designated the islands' only official language; a new currency, the Ionian drachma, was introduced with the aim to hamper trade with the rest of Greece, which was forbidden by Parini. Transportation with continental Greece was limited; in the courts, judges had to apply Italian law, and schooling followed the educational model of the Italian mainland. Greek administrative officials were replaced by Italian ones, administrative officials of non-Ionic origin were expelled, the local gendarmes were partially replaced by Italian [[Carabinieri]], although Parini initially allowed the Greek judges to continue their work, they were ultimately replaced by an Italian Military Court based in Corfu. The \"return to the Venetian order\" and the italianization as pursued by Parini were even more drastic than the italianization policies elsewhere, as their aim was a forced and abrupt cessation of all cultural and historical ties with the old mother country.

Parini reacted by opening a concentration camp on the island of [[Paxi]], to which two more camps were added on [[Othonoi]] and [[Lazaretto Island|Lazaretto]] islands. Parini's police troops arrested about 3,500 people, which were imprisoned at these three camps.<ref name=\"Stato Maggiore Difesa\"/> The Italianization efforts in the Ionian islands ended in September 1943, after the [[armistice of Cassibile]].\n\n===South Tyrol===\n{{Main|Italianization of South Tyrol}}\nIn 1919, at the time of its annexation, the southern part of [[county of Tyrol|Tyrol]] was inhabited by almost 90% [[German language|German]] speakers.<ref name=\"Provincial Statistics Institute of the Autonomous Province of South Tyrol\">Oscar Benvenuto (ed.): \"[http://www.provincia.bz.it/Astat/downloads/Siz_2008-eng.pdf South Tyrol in Figures 2008\", Provincial Statistics Institute of the Autonomous Province of South Tyrol], Bozen/Bolzano 2007, p. 19, Table 11</ref> In October 1923, the use of the Italian language became mandatory (although not exclusive) on all levels of federal, provincial and local government.<ref name=\"Steininger, 23-24\">Steininger, Rolf (2003), p. 23-24</ref> Regulations by the fascist authorities required that all kinds of signs and public notices had to be in Italian only.

The government created incentives to encourage immigration of native Italians to the South Tyrol.\n\nSeveral factors limited the effects of the Italian policy, namely the adverse nature of the territory (mainly mountains and valleys of difficult access), the difficulty for the Italians from [[southern Italy]] to adapt to a completely different environment and, later on, the alliance between [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and Italy. Under the 1939 [[South Tyrol Option Agreement]], [[Adolf Hitler]] and Benito Mussolini determined the status of the [[German people]] living in the province. They either had to opt for emigration to [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] or stay in Italy and become fully Italianized. Because of the outbreak of [[World War II]], this agreement was never fully implemented and most ethnic Germans remained or returned at the end of the war.\n\nFollowing World War II, South Tyrol was one of the first regions to be granted autonomy on the ground of the peculiar linguistic situation; any further attempts at Italianization were formerly abandoned.

The Savoyards imposed the Italian language on Sardinia as part of a wider cultural policy designed to bind the island to the Mainland in such a way as to prevent either future attempts of political separation, based on the [[Sardinian language|language]] native to the [[Sardinians|islanders]], or curb a renewed interest on the part of [[Spain]]. However, it was not until the rise of fascism that Sardinian was actively banned and/or excluded from any residual cultural activities to enforce a thorough [[language shift|shift]] to Italian.<ref>\u00abDopo pisani e genovesi si erano susseguiti aragonesi di lingua catalana, spagnoli di lingua castigliana, austriaci, piemontesi ed, infine, italiani [...] Nonostante questi impatti linguistici, la \"limba sarda\" si mantiene relativamente intatta attraverso i secoli.
