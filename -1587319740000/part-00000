The European Judo Championships now join other major championships, such as world gymnastics and orienteering events, coming to Scotland after next year's Commonwealth Games and the Ryder Cup.\"\n\n[[Kerrith Brown]], British Judo's current Chairman, hopes the Glasgow events will help further boost the sport's profile, with [[Gemma Gibbons]] (who now train's at JudoScotland's training centre in ratho) and [[Karina Bryant]] having won Olympic medals at London 2012. He said: \"It is an honour to have been selected by the EJU to host their flagship event and I am extremely proud of what our bid team and partners have achieved. We are confident that this event will be something special and provide a showcase for European judo to the world, creating a legacy for Great Britain sitting on a par in judo terms with [[London 2012]] and the 2014 Commonwealth Games.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/other-sports/glasgow-to-host-2015-european-judo-championships.1372331437|title=Glasgow to host 2015 European Judo Championships|publisher=Heraldscotland.com|accessdate=5 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.judoscotland.com/ Judo Scotland website]\n*[http://www.glasgow2014.com/ Glasgow Commonwealth Games]\n*[http://www.britishjudo.org.uk/ British Judo]\n\n[[Category:Sports organizations established in 1988]]\n[[Category:1988 establishments in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:1988 establishments in Scotland]]\n[[Category:Judo organizations]]\n[[Category:Sports governing bodies in Scotland]]\n[[Category:National members of the International Judo Federation]]\n", "name_user": "John of Reading", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eMen's European Cup Event 2013:Typo fixing, replaced: therefor \u2192 therefore", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JudoScotland"}

During a school trip to the Sweet Jazz Museum, she mysteriously becomes tired and falls asleep waking up hours later just in time to see the Banzai Blasters (an amateur villain-for-hire organization) arrive to steal the amulet. At the beginning of season 1, she is shown to be timid and unable to stand up for herself. Thanks to Giovanni, however, she manages to find herself becoming more assertive and self-caring. Her epithet, \"Dumb\", allows her to create a soundproof bubble to mute everything around herself inside and out. She can also dumb down pain she or others feel, sometimes using this to dumb down enemies, lowing their intelligence and making them highly suggestible.\n* Giovanni Potage (voiced by Kyle Igneczi) - Giovanni is a 19-year-old man who was the leader of the group of Banzai Blasters that broke into the museum to steal the Arsene Amulet. He is a very ambitious troublemaker who tries to look cool and menacing (but really comes off as pathetic). Even though he classifies himself as a villain, he has a secret soft side as he is shown to care for each and every one of his minions. When he meets Molly, he guides her into becoming more independent and even has her temporarily join him to take down Indus and Mera. His epithet, \"Soup\", allows him to make different kinds of soup (although the main one he uses is tomato basil flavor) and use it in different ways, such as turning it into a soup grenade. Also, every 13th attack he makes is stronger than the other ones, mostly because 13 is his lucky number. At the end of season 1, after being humiliated by his fellow Banzai Blasters, he leaves and becomes a solo villain.\n* Percival \"Percy\" King (voiced by Sandra Espinoza) - Percy is a young police detective who spearheads the investigation of the theft of the Arsene Amulet. She has a strict moral code as a police officer and values order and safety. As a downside to this, she speaks in a dry monotone with dry humor, often coming off as insensitive and straight-laced, especially to Mundies (people without epithets). Percy is skilled in wielding a, in her words, \"real-ass goddamned sword\" and is her primary form of attack. Her epithet, \"Parapet\", allows her to construct small buildings to either heal or injure whoever she is facing (e.g wizard towers that attack the enemy with a ball of electricity).\n* Mera Salamin (voiced by Lindsay Sheppard) - Mera is the main antagonist of the Museum arc. She is a crafty individual who pretended to be a Sweet Jazz Museum employee to get closer to the amulet. She is rather aggressive and seemingly selfish, willing to manipulate others and use dry sarcasm to inflict pain on others. Mera is also quite irresponsible, blaming the whole heist on her bodyguard Indus. Her epithet, \"Fragile\", allows her to increase the fragility of objects until they shatter. However, this also affects her body, with her reason for stealing the amulet being to negate the pain of her own epithet with one of others.\n* Indus Tarabella (voiced by Anthony Sardinha) - Indus is Mera's loyal bodyguard and sidekick. He joined Mera after she passed through his hometown of Desert Country, challenging him to a duel and easily besting him. After the dual, Indus followed Mera as her new bodyguard to try and learn to become strong like her. He is a gentle giant, with the intelligence of a child and a fondness for dinosaurs. He is also extremely gullible and doesn't quite think about his actions before he does them. His epithet, \"Barrier\", allows him to produce barriers that vary in size, and can be moved around.\n* Dr. Sylvester \"Sylvie\" Ashling (voiced by Zach Maher) - Sylvie is a 15-year old psychologist who investigates interactions between epithets and the human psyche. During the trip to the museum that Molly's class takes, he overhears Indus talking about the Arsene Amulet and decides to stay behind so he can find and study it. Sylvie is dedicated to research and his job as a psychologist. Isolating himself with his research as a child (with the consequences being he had no friends) Sylvie tends to acts snarky and push others away. He also has a tendency to think he is always right (leading to many arguments) and overthink things. Underneath that persona, he is actually quite caring. His epithet, \"Drowsy\", allows him to spread a golden dust, making anyone who breathes it in fall asleep. HIs other abilities include being able to summon nibbling counting sheep, bring people's worst fears to life and to put himself to sleep, making his own dreams come to life.\n* Ramsey Murdoch (voiced by William Sopp) - Introduced in the Western arc, Ramsey is a rat-faced underworld appraiser and sly con artist who is on the run from bounty hunter Zora. He is good at manipulating people to help reach his goals. Usually (especially when dealing with a customer), Ramsey is laid-backed and calm but when faced with being stuck in a rock and a hard place, he becomes panicky and cowardly. His epithet, \"Goldbricker\", allows him to transform objects into solid gold and back, including himself.\n* Zora Salazar (voiced by Dame Michelle Bennet) - Zora is the main antagonist of the Western arc. She was originally sent to take down Ramsey for embezzlement and forgery before Bliss Ocean (another terrorist organisation) designated her to retrieve the Arsene Amulet. She is incredibly malicious and selfish when it comes to achieving her goals, although she claims she doesn't do it that much because it'll become boring for her, is against the spirit of Bliss Ocean, and the fact that she prefers fair duals. Her epithet \"Sundial\" allows her to turn time forwards or backwards, including gravity, inertia, the cycle of the sun and even a person's lifespan. She is also a proficient shooter, with guns being her main weapon of choice.\n\n== Production ==\nBrendan Blaber began drafting the script for the series as early as Fall 2018 and pitched it to VRV in October of the same year. Official production is estimated to have begun sometime between March and May of 2019, where the series was developed and produced up until the airing of episode 7 on [[VRV (streaming service)|VRV]], on December 20th, 2019.\n\nThe concept of \"epithets\" were originally introduced in Brendan's [[Roll20]] Tabletop RPG campaign ''Anime Campaign'', and since he liked the concept so much, he decided to carry over many of the elements and characters to ''Epithet Erased'' with slight changes.\n\nAccording to Blaber, Season 1 cost almost a quarter of a million dollars to make, mostly raised from [[Patreon]] and by [[VRV (streaming service)|VRV]].\n\n== Release and reception ==\nThe first episode was released on [[VRV (streaming service)|VRV]] on 8th November 2019, exclusively in the United States. It was released internationally via [[YouTube]] on 22nd November 2019, with episodes coming out 2 weeks after their VRV premiere.\n\nThe series has received positive reviews, with many critics praising the concept, characters and writing with some critisicm directed towards the limited animation and plot direction.

It is also the name of the [[interpreter (computer software)|interpreter]] that executes Metafont code, generating the bitmap fonts that can be embedded into e.g. [[PostScript]]. Metafont was devised by [[Donald Knuth]] as a companion to his [[TeX]] typesetting system.\n\nOne of the characteristics of Metafont is that the points defining the shapes of the [[glyph]]s\u2014for example top of a [[Stem (typography)|stem]], or intersection of a stem and crossbar\u2014are defined with geometrical equations; the intent that the three stems of an \u2018m\u2019 are equally spaced horizontally might be expressed as <math> x_2-x_1 = x_3-x_2 </math> if points 1, 2, and 3 are at the bottom ends of the three stems, whereas the intent that they all end on the same vertical position would be <math> y_1 = y_2 = y_3 </math>.  Another characteristic is that Metafont is a [[Macro (computer science)|macro]] language, where operations such as \"draw a lower case top of stem serif at point 4\" might appear as one macro instruction (with the point as argument) in the program for a letter.  For describing shapes, Metafont has a rich set of [[B\u00e9zier cubic|path]] construction operations that mostly relieves the user of having to calculate control points.  Finally, many families of Metafont fonts are set up so that the main source file for a font only defines a small number of design parameters ([[x-height]], em width, slant, vertical stroke width, etc.), then calling a separate source file common for a whole range of fonts to actually draw the individual glyphs; this is the [[meta]] aspect of the system.\n\n==Modes of operation==\nMetafont is most often run as a helper to output device (printer, screen) drivers; in those cases, its job is to generate bitmaps for a font for a specific combination of output device (called a ''mode'' in Metafont) and [[Dots per inch|resolution]] (visible in the name of the output file, see below). These bitmaps are typically stored for later reuse, so that Metafont does not have to be run every time a document is displayed, but on the other hand TeX distributions with a Metafont component have typically not included any prebuilt bitmap fonts, since they would be rather large in comparison to the sources from which they could be generated. Since Metafont fonts were traditionally the TeX default from which other font formats were exceptions, an incomplete installation of a non-Metafont font can sometimes result in Metafont being called and emitting a confusing \"''somefont''.mf not found\" error message.\n\nEqually important, but not as common, is running Metafont to generate a font metric (TFM) file; a TFM file is only generated if the ''fontmaking'' variable is positive. Traditionally TeX distributions have often come with all TFM files pregenerated (since they are pretty small), but someone installing a Metafont font from sources will have to generate its TFM file before TeX can use it.\n\nA third way of operating Metafont is ''proof mode'': if the ''proofing'' variable is positive then the bitmap font file also contains additional information provided via <code>special</code> commands, in particular the positions and names of points the font designer considered important for the design. If using the separate <code>gftodvi</code> utility to generate enlarged images of the font glyphs, this  information from specials is included; point positions are not limited to pixel resolution.\n\nMetafont can also be run interactively, and has commands for displaying on the screen the images it produces. Knuth has said that he uses Metafont as a kind of desk calculator for solving complicated equations, though he now uses MetaPost for mathematical illustrations.\n<!-- could say something here about alternatives \u2013 e.g. vector versions such as pdftex uses -->\n\nMetafont can render any kind of graphical output, not just glyphs. However, [[MetaPost]] and [[Asymptote (vector graphics language)|Asymptote]] are preferred for mathematical illustrations. Metafont is most commonly invoked without a direct request from the user. [[DVI file format|DVI files]] can only contain references to typefaces, rather than the sets of raster or vector glyphs that other formats like PostScript allow. Consequently, the glyphs in the typefaces need to be accessed whenever a request is made to view, print or convert a DVI file.\n\n===Output files===\nMetafont outputs several kinds of files: for a file called NAME.mf, it can output:\n\n* NAME.NNNNgf \u2013 File with raster output at resolution NNNN (2602 by default). \n* NAME.tfm \u2013 File with [[TeX font metric]] information, which is the information TeX needs. Usually metafont has to be told to generate this file.\n* NAME.log \u2013 Log file output from processing\n\nAfter running Metafont, typically one uses the gftopk program to convert the NNNNgf files to pk (packed) format (.NNNNpk). The pk format was primarily introduced to reduce file size (to about half), but expected to also speed up processing since less data would have to be [[input/output]]. The GF and PK formats both employ [[run-length encoding]] of bitmaps, but make different binary encodings of the run-lengths. The PK format also does some preprocessing of the bitmaps (bounding box, eliding repeated rows) and encodes all rows of a character as one long bit-sequence.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rokicki |first1=Tomas |title=Packed (PK) Font File Format |journal=TUGboat |date=1985 |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=115\u2013120 |url=https://www.tug.org/TUGboat/tb06-3/tb13pk.pdf |accessdate=2019-08-09}}</ref>\n\nIn the ''TeX Directory Structure'' standard, filenames are limited to 8+3 characters, so GF and PK files would only have extensions <code>.gf</code> and <code>.pk</code>. Files for different resolutions are kept apart by placing them in separate directories, named <code>dpi</code>NNNN, e.g. <code>dpi300/cmr10.pk</code>.\n\n==Language==\nThe Metafont language is an [[interpreter (computing)|interpreted]] language for programs that are ''essentially [[declarative programming|declarative]] rather than [[imperative programming|imperative]]''.<ref name=\"METAFONTbook\">{{cite book |last1=Knuth |first1=Donald |title=The METAFONTbook |date=1986 |publisher=Addison Wesley |isbn=0-201-13445-4}}</ref>\n\n===Variables and equations===\nVariables in Metafont can be of eight different types:\n* Numeric: [[fixed-point arithmetic|fixed-point]] signed numbers with an [[machine epsilon|epsilon]] of <math>2^{-16}</math>, capped to be less than 4096 ([[Q (number format)|Q12.16]]). This is the default for variables not declared to be of another type.\n* Pair: a pair of numerics, used primarily for representing points in the plane.\n* Path: as in [[PostScript]]/[[PDF]]/[[SVG]], a [[parametric curve]] in the plane whose coordinate functions are [[piecewise]] cubic polynomials. As in those other systems, path segments are encoded as [[B\u00e9zier curve]]s in terms of knots and control points.\n* Transform: an [[affine transformation]] of the plane, equivalent to a \"(transformation) matrix\" in PostScript/PDF.\n* Pen: a convex polygon, representing the shape of a \"pen\" used for drawing.\n* Picture: a [[raster graphics|raster image]] with a signed integer value for each pixel.\n* [[Boolean data type|Boolean]]\n* String (of 8-bit characters)\n[[Metapost]] adds color (a triple of numerics) as a ninth type and has a completely different (non-raster) model for pictures; the latter is the main point of divergence between the two programs. Metafont vardef macros also live in the same namespace as variables and may in some ways be regarded as a ninth type of variable, although macros do not exist as [[first-class citizen|first-class]] values in Metafont.\n\nUnusually, the names of variables are not simple tokens, but sequences of symbolic tokens and numeric indices; the variable name <code>x2r</code> is thus not one [[alphanumeric]] token, but a sequence of the three tokens <code>x</code> (symbolic), <code>2</code> (numeric), and <code>r</code> (symbolic). [[Record (computer science)|Record]] and [[Array data type|array]] types may be simulated through collections of variables that share a common name prefix, an idiom supported by the type declaration system giving all variables whose names which differ only in numeric indices the same type (as expected for arrays) while keeping variables whole name differ in some symbolic token separate (as expected for records).\n\nA very distinctive feature of Metafont is the use of [[equation]]s to define variables. A numeric variable (or component of a pair or transformation variable) may be in the three states ''known'' (set), ''unknown independent'' (not set), and ''unknown dependent'' (not set, but given by a [[Linear function (calculus)|linear expression]] of one or several independents). When Metafont executes an equation statement, it turns one of the independents involved into a dependent and eliminates it from the expressions for all other dependents; when no independents remain in the expression for a dependent variable, that variable becomes known. Solving [[system of linear equations|''linear'' equation systems]] thus is a built-in feature of the Metafont language, and the recommended method of assigning most variables (especially those whose values have geometric significance) is to state equations determining their values. Equation systems frequently mix numeric (scalar) equations with pair (vector) equations.\n\nAn exception to the above is the class of ''internal quantity'' variables. These have names consisting of just one symbolic token, are always numeric, and are always known. They have a more direct internal representation than ordinary variables, making it convenient for primitive operations in Metafont (or extentions thereof) to use them implicitly.\n\n===Syntax===\nMetafont has numeric and string constant tokens with mainstream syntaxes; strings are delimited by <code>\"</code> quotes, numeric constants can have decimals but not an [[scientific notation|exponent part]]. All other tokens are classified as ''symbolic'', and can be redefined arbitrarily; there is no restriction that tokens with certain meanings must have names consisting of certain characters. At runtime, there can additionally be ''capsule'' tokens, which are effectively constant value tokens of arbitrary type; in the source code those appear as symbolic tokens.\n\nExcept where characters are involved in numeric or string constants, the extent of the token containing a particular character depends on to which class the character belongs; unlike [[TeX]], Metafont has fixed character classes. The characters <code>,</code>, <code>;</code>, <code>(</code>, and <code>)</code> are \"loners\" and only form single character tokens. For the character classes <code><=>:|</code>, <code>\u2018\u2019</code> (single quotes), <code>+-</code>, <code>/*\\</code>, <code>!?</code>, <code>#&@$</code>, <code>^~</code>, <code>[</code>, <code>]</code>, <code>{}</code>, and <code>.</code>, as well as the class of underscore together with upper and lower case A\u2013Z, the token consists of the longest consecutive sequence of characters from the same class. Whitespace characters don't contribute tokens. <code>%</code> starts a comment lasting until end of line.\n\nA notable application of these rules is that <code>#</code> is frequently appearing as part of variable names in Metafont code, e.g. <code>em#</code> and <code>pt#</code>.\n\nDelimiters (such as parentheses) do not have built-in meanings, instead there is a command that turns two symbolic tokens into a pair of matching delimiters, but normally Metafont programs use only the ordinary parentheses. Besides to override priorities in expressions, delimiters are also required around certain kinds of macro arguments.\n\n===Graphics===\nCurves in Metafont are defined as [[cubic spline]]s rather than quadratic, for greater versatility at the cost of more complex arithmetic.<ref>{{cite interview|last=Knuth|first=Donald|subject-link=Donald Knuth|interviewer=Advogato|title=Interview: Donald E.

Thus, rather than describing the outline of the glyph directly, a Metafont file describes the pen paths. Some simpler Metafont fonts, such as the calligraphic mathematics fonts in the [[Computer Modern]] family, use a single pen stroke with a relatively large pen to define each visual \"stroke\" of the glyphs. More complex fonts such as the [[Roman type|Roman]] text fonts in the Computer Modern family use a small pen to trace around the outline of the visual \"strokes\", which are then filled; the result is much like an outline font, but with slightly softened corners defined by the pen shape.\n\nSince the font shapes are defined by equations rather than directly coded numbers, it is possible to treat parameters such as aspect ratio, font slant, stroke width, [[serif]] size, and so forth as input parameters in each glyph definition (which then define not a single font, but a [[meta]]-font). Thus, by changing the value of one of these parameters at one location in the Metafont file, one can produce a consistent change throughout the entire font. Computer Modern Roman illustrates many uses of this feature; a typical TeX installation includes a number of versions of the font in sizes from 5pt to 17pt, with the stroke widths the same in all sizes (rather than increasing as the font is scaled up) and aspect ratios widening in the smaller sizes for increased legibility. In addition, the Computer Modern typewriter and [[sans-serif]] fonts are defined using essentially the same Metafont file as the Roman font, but with different global parameters.\n\n==Use==\nWhile well-known type designers, such as [[Hermann Zapf]], have collaborated with Knuth to create new fonts using Metafont, the system has not been widely adopted by professional type designers. Knuth attributes this to the fact that\n\"asking an artist to become enough of a mathematician to understand how to write a font with 60 parameters is too much.\"<ref>CSTUG, Charles University, Prague, March 1996, Questions and Answers with Prof. Donald E.

Due to shortcomings in the original Metafont language, Knuth developed an entirely new Metafont system in 1984, and it is this revised system that is used today; Metafont has a versioning system similar to that of [[TeX]], where the number [[asymptotically]] approaches ''[[e (mathematical constant)|e]]'' with each revision.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/abcde.html#bugs|title=Knuth: Computers and Typesetting|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Example==\nThe following example creates a closed beanlike shape for the character \"B\" of a font:\n<source lang=\"matlab\">\n%file name: beta.mf\n%mode_setup;\n% Define a beanlike shape for the character B\nbeginchar(\"B\",11pt#,11pt#,0);\n  % Setup coordinates as an equation system\n  y1=y2=y3=0;\n  y4=y5=y6=h;\n  x1=x4=0;\n  x2=x5=w;\n  x3=x6=2*w;\n\n  % Define pen\n  pickup pencircle xscaled 0.2w yscaled 0.04w rotated 45;\n\n  % Draw the character curve\n  % z1 is the same as (x1, y1)\n  draw z1..z3..z6{z2-z6}..z5..{z4-z2}z4..cycle;\nendchar;\n\nend\n</source>\nThis yields the following glyph:\n\n[[File:metafont-example-output.svg|284px]]\n\nThe above example will be processed with a command line such as:<ref name=grandsir>{{cite web|url=http://metafont.tutorial.free.fr/|title=METAFONT Tutorial|author=Christophe Grandsir}}</ref>\n\n<source lang=bash>mf '\\mode=ljfour; mode_setup; input beta.mf';\ngftopk beta.600gf beta.600pk</source>\n\nThen it can be used in a LaTeX file such as<ref name=grandsir/> (all files should dwell in the same directory or the TeX system should be informed about them using appropriate methods):\n<source lang=\"latex\">\n\\documentclass{article}\n\n\\newfont{\\letterbeta}{beta}\n\\newcommand{\\otherbeta}{{\\letterbeta B}}\n\n\\begin{document}\nLet's try having a strange \\otherbeta\\ here.\n\\end{document}\n</source>\nThe resulting PDF file should look like this:\n[[File:Tex mf beta.pdf|187px]]\n\n==Producing PostScript Type 1 fonts==\nThere are several tools for converting Metafont programs to [[PostScript Type 1]] fonts.

It is also the name of the [[interpreter (computer software)|interpreter]] that executes Metafont code, generating the bitmap fonts that can be embedded into e.g. [[PostScript]]. Metafont was devised by [[Donald Knuth]] as a companion to his [[TeX]] typesetting system.\n\nOne of the characteristics of Metafont is that the points defining the shapes of the [[glyph]]s\u2014for example top of a [[Stem (typography)|stem]], or intersection of a stem and crossbar\u2014are defined with geometrical equations; the intent that the three stems of an \u2018m\u2019 are equally spaced horizontally might be expressed as <math> x_2-x_1 = x_3-x_2 </math> if points 1, 2, and 3 are at the bottom ends of the three stems, whereas the intent that they all end on the same vertical position would be <math> y_1 = y_2 = y_3 </math>.  Another characteristic is that Metafont is a [[Macro (computer science)|macro]] language, where operations such as \"draw a lower case top of stem serif at point 4\" might appear as one macro instruction (with the point as argument) in the program for a letter.  For describing shapes, Metafont has a rich set of [[B\u00e9zier cubic|path]] construction operations that mostly relieves the user of having to calculate control points.  Finally, many families of Metafont fonts are set up so that the main source file for a font only defines a small number of design parameters ([[x-height]], em width, slant, vertical stroke width, etc.), then calling a separate source file common for a whole range of fonts to actually draw the individual glyphs; this is the [[meta]] aspect of the system.\n\n==Modes of operation==\nMetafont is most often run as a helper to output device (printer, screen) drivers; in those cases, its job is to generate bitmaps for a font for a specific combination of output device (called a ''mode'' in Metafont) and [[Dots per inch|resolution]] (visible in the name of the output file, see below). These bitmaps are typically stored for later reuse, so that Metafont does not have to be run every time a document is displayed, but on the other hand TeX distributions with a Metafont component have typically not included any prebuilt bitmap fonts, since they would be rather large in comparison to the sources from which they could be generated. Since Metafont fonts were traditionally the TeX default from which other font formats were exceptions, an incomplete installation of a non-Metafont font can sometimes result in Metafont being called and emitting a confusing \"''somefont''.mf not found\" error message.\n\nEqually important, but not as common, is running Metafont to generate a font metric (TFM) file; a TFM file is only generated if the ''fontmaking'' variable is positive. Traditionally TeX distributions have often come with all TFM files pregenerated (since they are pretty small), but someone installing a Metafont font from sources will have to generate its TFM file before TeX can use it.\n\nA third way of operating Metafont is ''proof mode'': if the ''proofing'' variable is positive then the bitmap font file also contains additional information provided via <code>special</code> commands, in particular the positions and names of points the font designer considered important for the design. If using the separate <code>gftodvi</code> utility to generate enlarged images of the font glyphs, this  information from specials is included; point positions are not limited to pixel resolution.\n\nMetafont can also be run interactively, and has commands for displaying on the screen the images it produces. Knuth has said that he uses Metafont as a kind of desk calculator for solving complicated equations, though he now uses MetaPost for mathematical illustrations.\n<!-- could say something here about alternatives \u2013 e.g. vector versions such as pdftex uses -->\n\nMetafont can render any kind of graphical output, not just glyphs. However, [[MetaPost]] and [[Asymptote (vector graphics language)|Asymptote]] are preferred for mathematical illustrations. Metafont is most commonly invoked without a direct request from the user. [[DVI file format|DVI files]] can only contain references to typefaces, rather than the sets of raster or vector glyphs that other formats like PostScript allow. Consequently, the glyphs in the typefaces need to be accessed whenever a request is made to view, print or convert a DVI file.\n\n===Output files===\nMetafont outputs several kinds of files: for a file called NAME.mf, it can output:\n\n* NAME.NNNNgf \u2013 File with raster output at resolution NNNN (2602 by default). \n* NAME.tfm \u2013 File with [[TeX font metric]] information, which is the information TeX needs. Usually metafont has to be told to generate this file.\n* NAME.log \u2013 Log file output from processing\n\nAfter running Metafont, typically one uses the gftopk program to convert the NNNNgf files to pk (packed) format (.NNNNpk). The pk format was primarily introduced to reduce file size (to about half), but expected to also speed up processing since less data would have to be [[input/output]]. The GF and PK formats both employ [[run-length encoding]] of bitmaps, but make different binary encodings of the run-lengths. The PK format also does some preprocessing of the bitmaps (bounding box, eliding repeated rows) and encodes all rows of a character as one long bit-sequence.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rokicki |first1=Tomas |title=Packed (PK) Font File Format |journal=TUGboat |date=1985 |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=115\u2013120 |url=https://www.tug.org/TUGboat/tb06-3/tb13pk.pdf |accessdate=2019-08-09}}</ref>\n\nIn the ''TeX Directory Structure'' standard, filenames are limited to 8+3 characters, so GF and PK files would only have extensions <code>.gf</code> and <code>.pk</code>. Files for different resolutions are kept apart by placing them in separate directories, named <code>dpi</code>NNNN, e.g. <code>dpi300/cmr10.pk</code>.\n\n==Language==\nThe Metafont language is an [[interpreter (computing)|interpreted]] language for programs that are ''essentially [[declarative programming|declarative]] rather than [[imperative programming|imperative]]''.<ref name=\"METAFONTbook\">{{cite book |last1=Knuth |first1=Donald |title=The METAFONTbook |date=1986 |publisher=Addison Wesley |isbn=0-201-13445-4}}</ref>\n\n===Variables and equations===\nVariables in Metafont can be of eight different types:\n* Numeric: [[fixed-point arithmetic|fixed-point]] signed numbers with an [[machine epsilon|epsilon]] of <math>2^{-16}</math>, capped to be less than 4096 ([[Q (number format)|Q12.16]]). This is the default for variables not declared to be of another type.\n* Pair: a pair of numerics, used primarily for representing points in the plane.\n* Path: as in [[PostScript]]/[[PDF]]/[[SVG]], a [[parametric curve]] in the plane whose coordinate functions are [[piecewise]] cubic polynomials. As in those other systems, path segments are encoded as [[B\u00e9zier curve]]s in terms of knots and control points.\n* Transform: an [[affine transformation]] of the plane, equivalent to a \"(transformation) matrix\" in PostScript/PDF.\n* Pen: a convex polygon, representing the shape of a \"pen\" used for drawing.\n* Picture: a [[raster graphics|raster image]] with a signed integer value for each pixel.\n* [[Boolean data type|Boolean]]\n* String (of 8-bit characters)\n[[Metapost]] adds color (a triple of numerics) as a ninth type and has a completely different (non-raster) model for pictures; the latter is the main point of divergence between the two programs. Metafont vardef macros also live in the same namespace as variables and may in some ways be regarded as a ninth type of variable, although macros do not exist as [[first-class citizen|first-class]] values in Metafont.\n\nUnusually, the names of variables are not simple tokens, but sequences of symbolic tokens and numeric indices; the variable name <code>x2r</code> is thus not one [[alphanumeric]] token, but a sequence of the three tokens <code>x</code> (symbolic), <code>2</code> (numeric), and <code>r</code> (symbolic). [[Record (computer science)|Record]] and [[Array data type|array]] types may be simulated through collections of variables that share a common name prefix, an idiom supported by the type declaration system giving all variables whose names which differ only in numeric indices the same type (as expected for arrays) while keeping variables whole name differ in some symbolic token separate (as expected for records).\n\nA very distinctive feature of Metafont is the use of [[equation]]s to define variables. A numeric variable (or component of a pair or transformation variable) may be in the three states ''known'' (set), ''unknown independent'' (not set), and ''unknown dependent'' (not set, but given by a [[Linear function (calculus)|linear expression]] of one or several independents). When Metafont executes an equation statement, it turns one of the independents involved into a dependent and eliminates it from the expressions for all other dependents; when no independents remain in the expression for a dependent variable, that variable becomes known. Solving [[system of linear equations|''linear'' equation systems]] thus is a built-in feature of the Metafont language, and the recommended method of assigning most variables (especially those whose values have geometric significance) is to state equations determining their values. Equation systems frequently mix numeric (scalar) equations with pair (vector) equations.\n\nAn exception to the above is the class of ''internal quantity'' variables. These have names consisting of just one symbolic token, are always numeric, and are always known. They have a more direct internal representation than ordinary variables, making it convenient for primitive operations in Metafont (or extentions thereof) to use them implicitly.\n\n===Syntax===\nMetafont has numeric and string constant tokens with mainstream syntaxes; strings are delimited by <code>\"</code> quotes, numeric constants can have decimals but not an [[scientific notation|exponent part]]. All other tokens are classified as ''symbolic'', and can be redefined arbitrarily; there is no restriction that tokens with certain meanings must have names consisting of certain characters. At runtime, there can additionally be ''capsule'' tokens, which are effectively constant value tokens of arbitrary type; in the source code those appear as symbolic tokens.\n\nExcept where characters are involved in numeric or string constants, the extent of the token containing a particular character depends on to which class the character belongs; unlike [[TeX]], Metafont has fixed character classes. The characters <code>,</code>, <code>;</code>, <code>(</code>, and <code>)</code> are \"loners\" and only form single character tokens. For the character classes <code><=>:|</code>, <code>\u2018\u2019</code> (single quotes), <code>+-</code>, <code>/*\\</code>, <code>!?</code>, <code>#&@$</code>, <code>^~</code>, <code>[</code>, <code>]</code>, <code>{}</code>, and <code>.</code>, as well as the class of underscore together with upper and lower case A\u2013Z, the token consists of the longest consecutive sequence of characters from the same class. Whitespace characters don't contribute tokens. <code>%</code> starts a comment lasting until end of line.\n\nA notable application of these rules is that <code>#</code> is frequently appearing as part of variable names in Metafont code, e.g. <code>em#</code> and <code>pt#</code>.\n\nDelimiters (such as parentheses) do not have built-in meanings, instead there is a command that turns two symbolic tokens into a pair of matching delimiters, but normally Metafont programs use only the ordinary parentheses. Besides to override priorities in expressions, delimiters are also required around certain kinds of macro arguments.\n\n===Graphics===\nCurves in Metafont are defined as [[cubic spline]]s rather than quadratic, for greater versatility at the cost of more complex arithmetic.<ref>{{cite interview|last=Knuth|first=Donald|subject-link=Donald Knuth|interviewer=Advogato|title=Interview: Donald E. Knuth|url=http://www.advogato.org/article/28.html|date=January 25, 2000|access-date=January 13, 2016|quote=...the mathematics is really simple for a quadratic.

Thus, rather than describing the outline of the glyph directly, a Metafont file describes the pen paths. Some simpler Metafont fonts, such as the calligraphic mathematics fonts in the [[Computer Modern]] family, use a single pen stroke with a relatively large pen to define each visual \"stroke\" of the glyphs. More complex fonts such as the [[Roman type|Roman]] text fonts in the Computer Modern family use a small pen to trace around the outline of the visual \"strokes\", which are then filled; the result is much like an outline font, but with slightly softened corners defined by the pen shape.\n\nSince the font shapes are defined by equations rather than directly coded numbers, it is possible to treat parameters such as aspect ratio, font slant, stroke width, [[serif]] size, and so forth as input parameters in each glyph definition (which then define not a single font, but a [[meta]]-font). Thus, by changing the value of one of these parameters at one location in the Metafont file, one can produce a consistent change throughout the entire font. Computer Modern Roman illustrates many uses of this feature; a typical TeX installation includes a number of versions of the font in sizes from 5pt to 17pt, with the stroke widths the same in all sizes (rather than increasing as the font is scaled up) and aspect ratios widening in the smaller sizes for increased legibility. In addition, the Computer Modern typewriter and [[sans-serif]] fonts are defined using essentially the same Metafont file as the Roman font, but with different global parameters.\n\n==Use==\nWhile well-known type designers, such as [[Hermann Zapf]], have collaborated with Knuth to create new fonts using Metafont, the system has not been widely adopted by professional type designers. Knuth attributes this to the fact that\n\"asking an artist to become enough of a mathematician to understand how to write a font with 60 parameters is too much.\"<ref>CSTUG, Charles University, Prague, March 1996, Questions and Answers with Prof. Donald E.

Due to shortcomings in the original Metafont language, Knuth developed an entirely new Metafont system in 1984, and it is this revised system that is used today; Metafont has a versioning system similar to that of [[TeX]], where the number [[asymptotically]] approaches ''[[e (mathematical constant)|e]]'' with each revision.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/abcde.html#bugs|title=Knuth: Computers and Typesetting|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Example==\nThe following example creates a closed beanlike shape for the character \"B\" of a font:\n<source lang=\"matlab\">\n%file name: beta.mf\n%mode_setup;\n% Define a beanlike shape for the character B\nbeginchar(\"B\",11pt#,11pt#,0);\n  % Setup coordinates as an equation system\n  y1=y2=y3=0;\n  y4=y5=y6=h;\n  x1=x4=0;\n  x2=x5=w;\n  x3=x6=2*w;\n\n  % Define pen\n  pickup pencircle xscaled 0.2w yscaled 0.04w rotated 45;\n\n  % Draw the character curve\n  % z1 is the same as (x1, y1)\n  draw z1..z3..z6{z2-z6}..z5..{z4-z2}z4..cycle;\nendchar;\n\nend\n</source>\nThis yields the following glyph:\n\n[[File:metafont-example-output.svg|284px]]\n\nThe above example will be processed with a command line such as:<ref name=grandsir>{{cite web|url=http://metafont.tutorial.free.fr/|title=METAFONT Tutorial|author=Christophe Grandsir}}</ref>\n\n<pre>mf '\\mode=ljfour; mode_setup; input beta.mf'; gftopk beta.600gf beta.600pk</pre>\n\nThen it can be used in a LaTeX file such as<ref name=grandsir/> (all files should dwell in the same directory or the TeX system should be informed about them using appropriate methods):\n<source lang=\"latex\">\n\\documentclass{article}\n\n\\newfont{\\letterbeta}{beta}\n\\newcommand{\\otherbeta}{{\\letterbeta B}}\n\n\\begin{document}\nLet's try having a strange \\otherbeta\\ here.\n\\end{document}\n</source>\nThe resulting PDF file should look like this:\n[[File:Tex mf beta.pdf|187px]]\n\n==Producing PostScript Type 1 fonts==\nThere are several tools for converting Metafont programs to [[PostScript Type 1]] fonts.
