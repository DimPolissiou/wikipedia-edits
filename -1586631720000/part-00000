He served as [[Minister of Finance (New Zealand)|Minister of Finance]] (1957\u20131960) and later as [[Leader of the New Zealand Labour Party|Leader]] of the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] and [[Leader of the Opposition (New Zealand)|Leader of the Opposition]] (1963\u20131965).\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Arnold Nordmeyer 1935.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Nordmeyer, {{circa|1935}}]]\nNordmeyer was born on 7 February 1901 in [[Dunedin]], New Zealand. His father was a German immigrant, his mother was from [[Northern Ireland]]. He was educated at [[Waitaki Boys' High School]], and at the [[University of Otago]] where he completed his BA. After graduating he studied [[theology]], having always been highly religious.<ref name=\"DNZB Nordmeyer\">{{DNZB|last=Brown|first=Bruce |id=5n12|title=Nordmeyer, Arnold Henry \u2013 Biography|accessdate=6 October 2012}}</ref> At university he became known for his skills in debating which were to serve him well in his later career.

He was elected. The 1935 election itself was a huge victory for Labour and the party's leader, [[Michael Joseph Savage]], became the country's first Labour [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]].{{sfn|Wilson|1985|p=58}}\n\nIn [[New Zealand Parliament|Parliament]] Nordmeyer proved to be a skilled debater but also had a somewhat troubled relationship with his party's leadership. Nordmeyer became part of the faction led by [[John A. Lee]] who criticised Savage's policies as too moderate. Gradually, however, Nordmeyer became disillusioned with Lee, alleging that Lee was egotistical and self-important. Nordmeyer later co-operated with more moderate politicians such as [[Walter Nash]] in drafting the party's [[social security]] policies. He chaired both the caucus committee and the parliamentary select committee which considered the matters in more depth. Eventually the committees recommended a scheme containing a means-tested pension, universal superannuation, and free healthcare for hospital treatments, maternity care and general practitioner consultations all to be financed via direct taxation. At Nordmeyer's insistence, the health and pensions schemes would be combined into a single measure which later became the [[Social Security Act 1938]].<ref name=\"DNZB Nordmeyer\" />\n\nAfter the [[1938 New Zealand general election|1938 election]] that Labour won resoundingly, tensions between the moderate and extreme wings of the party became worse. Nordmeyer attempted to take a position between both groups but was generally closer to Lee's camp than to the other. The year 1940 saw both the death of Savage and the expulsion from the Labour Party of Lee (a move which Nordmeyer opposed, weakly). Nordmeyer nominated [[Gervan McMillan]], an old friend from Kurow and a supporter of Lee, as the party's new leader. McMillan, however, was defeated by [[Peter Fraser]], Savage's chief lieutenant.\n\n===Cabinet minister===\nIn 1941 Nordmeyer became [[Minister of Health (New Zealand)|Minister of Health]]. In this role, which he held until 1947, he was responsible (along with Walter Nash) for introducing state subsidies for doctor's visits. The New Zealand Branch of the [[British Medical Association]] had disagreed with the government on the process of free general practitioner consultations where they refused to accept a state fee for their services. Doctors argued that the relationship between themselves and patients was dependent on a direct payment by the patient. A compromise was eventually reached where doctors would continue to charge patients directly after which time patients could then claim a social security rebate. With this initial hurdle overcome, Nordmeyer progressed with the governments agenda over the next six years introducing further benefits for pharmaceutical prescriptions, dental care, hospital outpatients and X-ray diagnosis.<ref name=\"DNZB Nordmeyer\" />\n\nFrom 1947 to 1949, Nordmeyer was [[Minister of Industries and Commerce]].{{sfn|Wilson|1985|p=84}} He was charged with the administration of New Zealand's comprehensive system of import licensing controls and was an advocate for the establishment of new industries and having greater protection for local industries. By this time he came to be regarded as one of the most senior members of the government.<ref name=\"DNZB Nordmeyer\" />\n\nIn the [[1949 New Zealand general election|1949 election]], however, Labour was defeated by the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] under [[Sidney Holland]]. Nordmeyer himself lost his seat of Oamaru against [[Thomas Hayman]].{{sfn|Gustafson|1986|p=320}} In late 1950 Peter Fraser died and Nordmeyer was elected in the [[1951 Brooklyn by-election|1951 by-election]] as his replacement in the seat of [[Brooklyn (electorate)|Brooklyn]]. In 1954 he won the [[Island Bay (New Zealand electorate)|Island Bay]] seat, which he held until he retired in 1969.{{sfn|Wilson|1985|p=223}}\n\nIn the short period between Fraser's death and Nordmeyer's return to Parliament Walter Nash had been hastily elected leader of the Labour Party. The speed of Nash's ascent is sometimes seen as evidence that his supporters considered Nordmeyer a threat. Nordmeyer, although he had worked with Nash before, opposed Nash's appointment as he objected to Nash's leadership style and considered Nash to be both autocratic and uninspiring. In 1954 Nordmeyer began a challenge for the leadership. Although Nordmeyer gained considerable backing from certain sectors of the party, Nash enjoyed strong union support and defeated the challenge in [[caucus]] on [[1954 New Zealand Labour Party leadership election|23 June 1954]].{{sfn|Logan|2008|p=280-1}}\n\nFollowing the [[1954 New Zealand Labour Party leadership election|unsuccessful challenge]] to Nash, Nordmeyer together with [[Bill Anderton]] and [[Phil Connolly]] were called before The Labour Party National Executive and given warnings about the threat of divisiveness to the party.{{sfn|Logan|2008|p=281}}\n\n===Minister of Finance===\n[[File:Walter Nash and Arnold Henry Nordmeyer.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Nash and Nordmeyer in 1958.]]\nWhen Labour won the [[1957 New Zealand general election|1957 election]] Nordmeyer was made [[Minister of Finance (New Zealand)|Minister of Finance]] and was ranked third within the government.{{sfn|Wilson|1985|p=88}} A short time after taking office Nordmeyer concluded that the country was on the brink of a [[balance of payments]] crisis and decided to take strong measures in response. His first Budget (generally known as \"the [[Black Budget (New Zealand)|Black Budget]]\") introduced a number of unpopular changes, including significant tax increases. The particularly large tax increases for alcohol and tobacco, coupled with Nordmeyer's strong religious background, created the impression that he was attempting to impose  puritan-like reforms. Labour was voted out of office in the [[1960 New Zealand general election|1960 election]], something that many historians blame on Nordmeyer's \"Black Budget\".<ref name=\"DNZB Nordmeyer\" />\n\n===Leader of the Opposition===\nDespite attracting considerable blame for Labour's loss of support Nordmeyer was elected to lead the Labour Party when Nash retired in 1963.<ref name=\"DNZB Nordmeyer\" /> Future interim Prime Minister, [[Hugh Watt]] became Nordmeyer's deputy leader.{{sfn|Hayward|1981|p=13}} The memory of the \"Black Budget\" still haunted Nordmeyer's profile, however, and many within the party believed that it was time for \"a new generation\" to take control. In 1965 a group of Labour MP's formed a group known as the 'Mafia' who were dedicated to replacing Nordmeyer with [[Norman Kirk]]. This was due to some within the Labour caucus thinking Nordmeyer \"out of touch\" with his Members and vice versa, some considering him an autocratic loner, despite his considerable debating abilities.{{sfn|Hayward|1981|p=56}} Norman Kirk eventually emerged as the favourite candidate to succeed Nordmeyer and in a vote on 9 December 1965, Nordmeyer was defeated by 25 votes to 10.<ref name=\"DNZB Nordmeyer\" /> A later Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand quipped about Nordmeyer:<ref>{{cite book | last1=Weir | first1=Jim | authorlink1=Jim Weir (diplomat) | title=Strong language: very quotable New Zealand quotes | date=2007 | publisher=[[New Holland Publishers]] | location=Auckland | isbn=978-1-86966-182-3 | page=65}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote|text=... the best Prime Minister we never had. |author=[[Michael Cullen (politician)|Michael Cullen]]}}\n\n==Retirement from politics==\nNordmeyer remained in Parliament for another four years, retiring at the [[1969 New Zealand general election|1969 election]].{{sfn|Wilson|1985|p=223}} At the 1971 local-body elections he was elected a member of the Wellington Hospital Board.<ref>{{cite report |last=Petersen |first=G.A. |date=19 October 1971 |title=Declaration of Election Results |url= |publisher=[[Wellington City Council]] |page= |docket= |access-date= }}</ref>\n\nHe later held a number of government appointments, including the position of director of the [[Reserve Bank of New Zealand]]. In the [[1975 Birthday Honours|1975 Queen's Birthday Honours]] Nordmeyer was appointed a [[Knight Commander of The Most Distinguished Order of Saint Michael and Saint George|Knight Commander of the Order of St. Michael and St. George]] \"for public services\".<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=46595 |date=6 June 1975 |page=7405 |supp=1}}</ref> On 6 February 1987 Nordmeyer was the fifth appointee to the [[Order of New Zealand]].<ref name=\"DNZB Nordmeyer\" /><ref name=induction01>\"The Order of New Zealand\" (12 February 1987) 20 ''{{nowrap|[[New Zealand Gazette]]}}'' 705 at 709.</ref>\n\nNordmeyer was one of the staunchest opponents of [[Capital punishment in New Zealand|capital punishment]] and was also staunchly opposed to abortion, being a patron of New Zealand's main [[anti-abortion]] group [[Voice for Life|Society for the Protection of the Unborn Child]] (SPUC).\n\nNordmeyer died in Wellington on 2 February 1989, survived by his wife Frances and their two children. His family declined the offer of a state funeral instead opting to scatter his ashes by [[Lake \u014chau]].<ref name=\"DNZB Nordmeyer\" />\n\n==Personal life==\nNordmeyer married Frances Maria Kernahan in Oamaru on 28 October 1931.

It was also in Kurow that Nordmeyer met his future wife, Frances Kernahan whom he married in 1931.{{sfn|Logan|2008|p=32}}\n\n==Political career==\n===Member of Parliament===\n{{NZ parlbox header|nolist=true|align=left}}\n{{NZ parlbox\n |party=New Zealand Labour Party\n |electorate=[[Oamaru (New Zealand electorate)|Oamaru]]\n |start={{NZ election link year|1935}}\n |end=1938\n |term=25th\n}}\n{{NZ parlbox\n |party=New Zealand Labour Party\n |electorate = Oamaru\n |start={{NZ election link year|1938}}\n |end=1943\n |term=26th\n}}\n{{NZ parlbox\n |party=New Zealand Labour Party\n |electorate = Oamaru\n |start={{NZ election link year|1943}}\n |end=1946\n |term=27th\n}}\n{{NZ parlbox\n |party=New Zealand Labour Party\n |electorate = Oamaru\n |start={{NZ election link year|1946}}\n |end=1949\n |term=28th\n}}\n{{NZ parlbox break}}\n{{NZ parlbox\n |party=New Zealand Labour Party\n |electorate=[[Brooklyn (New Zealand electorate)|Brooklyn]]\n |start={{By-election link year|Brooklyn|1951}}\n |term=29th\n}}\n{{NZ parlbox\n |party=New Zealand Labour Party\n |electorate = Brooklyn\n |start={{NZ election link year|1951}}\n |end=1954\n |term=30th\n}}\n{{NZ parlbox\n |party=New Zealand Labour Party\n |electorate=[[Island Bay (New Zealand electorate)|Island Bay]]\n |start={{NZ election link year|1954}}\n |end=1957\n |term=31st\n}}\n{{NZ parlbox\n |party=New Zealand Labour Party\n |electorate = Island Bay\n |start={{NZ election link year|1957}}\n |end=1960\n |term=32nd\n}}\n{{NZ parlbox\n |party=New Zealand Labour Party\n |electorate = Island Bay\n |start={{NZ election link year|1960}}\n |end=1963\n |term=33rd\n}}\n{{NZ parlbox\n |party=New Zealand Labour Party\n |electorate = Island Bay\n |start={{NZ election link year|1963}}\n |end=1966\n |term=34th\n}}\n{{NZ parlbox\n |party=New Zealand Labour Party\n |electorate = Island Bay\n |start={{NZ election link year|1966}}\n |end=1969\n |term=35th\n}}\n{{NZ parlbox footer}}\nShortly before the [[1935 New Zealand general election|1935 election]] Nordmeyer stepped down from his church position, stating an intent to contest the [[Oamaru (New Zealand electorate)|Oamaru]] seat for the Labour Party. He was elected. The 1935 election itself was a huge victory for Labour and the party's leader, [[Michael Joseph Savage]], became the country's first Labour [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]].{{sfn|Wilson|1985|p=58}}\n\nIn [[New Zealand Parliament|Parliament]] Nordmeyer proved to be a skilled debater but also had a somewhat troubled relationship with his party's leadership. Nordmeyer became part of the faction led by [[John A. Lee]] who criticised Savage's policies as too moderate. Gradually, however, Nordmeyer became disillusioned with Lee, alleging that Lee was egotistical and self-important. Nordmeyer later co-operated with more moderate politicians such as [[Walter Nash]] in drafting the party's [[social security]] policies. He chaired both the caucus committee and the parliamentary select committee which considered the matters in more depth. Eventually the committees recommended a scheme containing a means-tested pension, universal superannuation, and free healthcare for hospital treatments, maternity care and general practitioner consultations all to be financed via direct taxation. At Nordmeyer's insistence, the health and pensions schemes would be combined into a single measure which later became the [[Social Security Act 1938]].<ref name=\"DNZB Nordmeyer\" />\n\nAfter the [[1938 New Zealand general election|1938 election]] that Labour won resoundingly, tensions between the moderate and extreme wings of the party became worse. Nordmeyer attempted to take a position between both groups but was generally closer to Lee's camp than to the other. The year 1940 saw both the death of Savage and the expulsion from the Labour Party of Lee (a move which Nordmeyer opposed, weakly). Nordmeyer nominated [[Gervan McMillan]], an old friend from Kurow and a supporter of Lee, as the party's new leader. McMillan, however, was defeated by [[Peter Fraser]], Savage's chief lieutenant.\n\n===Cabinet minister===\nIn 1941 Nordmeyer became [[Minister of Health (New Zealand)|Minister of Health]]. In this role, which he held until 1947, he was responsible (along with Walter Nash) for introducing state subsidies for doctor's visits. The New Zealand Branch of the [[British Medical Association]] had disagreed with the government on the process of free general practitioner consultations where they refused to accept a state fee for their services. Doctors argued that the relationship between themselves and patients was dependent on a direct payment by the patient. A compromise was eventually reached where doctors would continue to charge patients directly after which time patients could then claim a social security rebate. With this initial hurdle overcome, Nordmeyer progressed with the governments agenda over the next six years introducing further benefits for pharmaceutical prescriptions, dental care, hospital outpatients and X-ray diagnosis.<ref name=\"DNZB Nordmeyer\" />\n\nFrom 1947 to 1949, Nordmeyer was [[Minister of Industries and Commerce]].{{sfn|Wilson|1985|p=84}} He was charged with the administration of New Zealand's comprehensive system of import licensing controls and was an advocate for the establishment of new industries and having greater protection for local industries. By this time he came to be regarded as one of the most senior members of the government.<ref name=\"DNZB Nordmeyer\" />\n\nIn the [[1949 New Zealand general election|1949 election]], however, Labour was defeated by the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] under [[Sidney Holland]]. Nordmeyer himself lost his seat of Oamaru against [[Thomas Hayman]].{{sfn|Gustafson|1986|p=320}} In late 1950 Peter Fraser died and Nordmeyer was elected in the [[1951 Brooklyn by-election|1951 by-election]] as his replacement in the seat of [[Brooklyn (electorate)|Brooklyn]]. In 1954 he won the [[Island Bay (New Zealand electorate)|Island Bay]] seat, which he held until he retired in 1969.{{sfn|Wilson|1985|p=223}}\n\nIn the short period between Fraser's death and Nordmeyer's return to Parliament Walter Nash had been hastily elected leader of the Labour Party. The speed of Nash's ascent is sometimes seen as evidence that his supporters considered Nordmeyer a threat. Nordmeyer, although he had worked with Nash before, opposed Nash's appointment as he objected to Nash's leadership style and considered Nash to be both autocratic and uninspiring. In 1954 Nordmeyer began a challenge for the leadership. Although Nordmeyer gained considerable backing from certain sectors of the party, Nash enjoyed strong union support and defeated the challenge in [[caucus]] on [[1954 New Zealand Labour Party leadership election|23 June 1954]].{{sfn|Logan|2008|p=280-1}}\n\nFollowing the [[1954 New Zealand Labour Party leadership election|unsuccessful challenge]] to Nash, Nordmeyer together with [[Bill Anderton]] and [[Phil Connolly]] were called before The Labour Party National Executive and given warnings about the threat of divisiveness to the party.{{sfn|Logan|2008|p=281}}\n\n===Minister of Finance===\n[[File:Walter Nash and Arnold Henry Nordmeyer.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Nash and Nordmeyer in 1958.]]\nWhen Labour won the [[1957 New Zealand general election|1957 election]] Nordmeyer was made [[Minister of Finance (New Zealand)|Minister of Finance]] and was ranked third within the government.{{sfn|Wilson|1985|p=88}} A short time after taking office Nordmeyer concluded that the country was on the brink of a [[balance of payments]] crisis and decided to take strong measures in response. His first Budget (generally known as \"the [[Black Budget (New Zealand)|Black Budget]]\") introduced a number of unpopular changes, including significant tax increases. The particularly large tax increases for alcohol and tobacco, coupled with Nordmeyer's strong religious background, created the impression that he was attempting to impose  puritan-like reforms. Labour was voted out of office in the [[1960 New Zealand general election|1960 election]], something that many historians blame on Nordmeyer's \"Black Budget\".<ref name=\"DNZB Nordmeyer\" />\n\n===Leader of the Opposition===\nDespite attracting considerable blame for Labour's loss of support Nordmeyer was elected to lead the Labour Party when Nash retired in 1963.<ref name=\"DNZB Nordmeyer\" /> Future interim Prime Minister, [[Hugh Watt]] became Nordmeyer's deputy leader.{{sfn|Hayward|1981|p=13}} The memory of the \"Black Budget\" still haunted Nordmeyer's profile, however, and many within the party believed that it was time for \"a new generation\" to take control. In 1965 a group of Labour MP's formed a group known as the 'Mafia' who were dedicated to replacing Nordmeyer with [[Norman Kirk]]. This was due to some within the Labour caucus thinking Nordmeyer \"out of touch\" with his Members and vice versa, some considering him an autocratic loner, despite his considerable debating abilities.{{sfn|Hayward|1981|p=56}} Norman Kirk eventually emerged as the favourite candidate to succeed Nordmeyer and in a vote on 9 December 1965, Nordmeyer was defeated by 25 votes to 10.<ref name=\"DNZB Nordmeyer\" /> A later Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand quipped about Nordmeyer:<ref>{{cite book | last1=Weir | first1=Jim | authorlink1=Jim Weir (diplomat) | title=Strong language: very quotable New Zealand quotes | date=2007 | publisher=[[New Holland Publishers]] | location=Auckland | isbn=978-1-86966-182-3 | page=65}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote|text=... the best Prime Minister we never had. |author=[[Michael Cullen (politician)|Michael Cullen]]}}\n\n==Retirement from politics==\nNordmeyer remained in Parliament for another four years, retiring at the [[1969 New Zealand general election|1969 election]].{{sfn|Wilson|1985|p=223}} At the 1971 local-body elections he was elected a member of the Wellington Hospital Board.<ref>{{cite report |last=Petersen |first=G.A. |date=19 October 1971 |title=Declaration of Election Results |url= |publisher=[[Wellington City Council]] |page= |docket= |access-date= }}</ref>\n\nHe later held a number of government appointments, including the position of director of the [[Reserve Bank of New Zealand]].

The [[continental crust]] forms a stable [[Mesoproterozoic]] [[craton]] which changes across a broad continental margin and transitional crust into true [[oceanic crust]] of the Gulf of Mexico. The oldest rocks in Texas date from the Mesoproterozoic and are about 1,600 million years old.\n\nThese [[Precambrian]] [[igneous]] and [[metamorphic rock]]s underlie most of the state, and are exposed in three places: [[Llano, Texas|Llano]] uplift, [[Van Horn, Texas|Van Horn]], and the [[Franklin Mountains (Texas)|Franklin Mountains]], near El Paso. [[Sedimentary rocks]] overlay most of these ancient rocks. The oldest sediments were deposited on the flanks of a rifted continental margin, or [[passive margin]] that developed during [[Cambrian]] time.\n\nThis margin existed until [[Laurasia]] and [[Gondwana]] collided in the [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]] subperiod to form [[Pangea]].

Pangea began to break up in the [[Triassic]], but [[seafloor spreading]] to form the Gulf of Mexico occurred only in the mid- and [[late Jurassic]].

Today {{convert|9|to|12|mi|km|0|}} of sediments are buried beneath the Texas continental shelf and a large proportion of remaining US [[oil reserves]] are here.

[[Archaeologists]] have found that three major indigenous cultures lived in this territory, and reached their developmental peak before the first European contact. These were:<ref name=\"Richardson\">Richardson (2005), p. 9.</ref>\n* the [[Ancestral Puebloans|Pueblo]] from the upper [[Rio Grande]] region, centered west of Texas;\n* the [[Mississippian culture]], also known as [[Mound Builders]], which extended along the [[Mississippi River Valley]] east of Texas; and\n* the civilizations of [[Mesoamerica]], centered south of Texas. Influence of [[Teotihuacan]] in northern Mexico peaked around AD 500 and declined over the 8th to 10th centuries.\n\nWhen Europeans arrived in the Texas region, there were several races of Native peoples divided into many smaller tribes. They were Caddoan, Atakapan, Athabaskan, Coahuiltecan, and Uto-Aztecan. The Uto-Aztecan Puebloan peoples lived neared the Rio Grande in the western portion of the state, the Athabaskan-speaking Apache tribes lived throughout the interior, the Caddoans controlled much of the Red River region and the Atakapans were mostly centered along the Gulf Coast. At least one tribe of Coahuiltecans, the [[Aranama]], lived in southern Texas. This entire culture group, primarily centered in northeastern Mexico, is now extinct. It is difficult to say who lived in the northwestern region of the state originally. By the time the region came to be explored, it belonged to the fairly well-known Comanche, another Uto-Aztecan people who had transitioned into a powerful horse culture, but it is believed that they came later and did not live there during the 16th century. It may have been claimed by several different peoples, including Uto-Aztecans, Athabaskans, or even Dhegihan Siouans.\n\nNo culture was dominant in the present-day Texas region, and many peoples inhabited the area.<ref name=\"Richardson\" /> Native American tribes who lived inside the boundaries of present-day Texas include the [[Alabama people|Alabama]], [[Apache]], [[Atakapa]]n, [[Bidai]], [[Caddo]], Aranama, [[Comanche]], [[Choctaw]], [[Coushatta]], [[Hasinai]], [[Jumano people|Jumano]], [[Karankawa people|Karankawa]], [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoo]], [[Kiowa]], [[Tonkawa]], and [[Wichita people|Wichita]].<ref>Richardson (2005), pp 10\u201316</ref><ref name=\"HoT bzi04\">{{cite Handbook of Texas|id=bzi04|title=Indians|first=George |last=Klos|date=June 15, 2010}}</ref> The name '''''Texas''''' derives from ''t\u00e1ysha\u0294'', a word in the [[Caddoan languages|Caddoan language]] of the ''Hasinai'', which means \"friends\" or \"allies\".<ref name=\"facts\">{{cite book |title=Facts |edition=2010\u20132011 |work=[[Texas Almanac]] |url=http://texasalmanac.com/topics/facts-profile |first=Robert |last=Plocheck |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110228054833/http://www.texasalmanac.com/topics/facts-profile |archivedate=February 28, 2011 |date=November 20, 2017 }}</ref><ref name=\"TribesofTexas\">{{cite Handbook of Texas |last=Fry |first=Phillip L. |title=Texas, Origin of Name |id=pft04 |orig-year=July 15, 2010 |date=March 7, 2016}}</ref><ref>Richardson, p 1</ref><ref name=\"etymology\">{{cite web |url=https://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Texas |title=Texas |accessdate=February 25, 2007 |website=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Douglas Harper}}</ref><ref name=\"WChafe\">Wallace Chafe, p.c.</ref>\n\nThe region was primarily controlled by the Spanish for the first couple centuries of contact, until the Texas Revolution. They were not particularly kind to their native populations\u2014even less so with the Caddoans, who were not trusted as their culture was split between the Spanish and the French. When the Spanish briefly managed to conquer the Louisiana colony, they decided to switch tactics and attempt being exceedingly friendly to the Indians, which they continued even after the French took back the colony. After the 1803 Louisiana Purchase, the United States inherited this odd circumstance. The Caddoans preferred the company of Americans{{According to whom|date=March 2019}} and almost the entire population of them migrated into the states of Louisiana and Arkansas. The Spanish felt jilted after having spent so much time and effort and began trying to lure the Caddo back, even promising them more land. Seemingly without actually knowing how they came by it,{{According to whom|date=March 2019}} the United States (who had begun convincing tribes to self-segregate from whites by selling everything and moving west ever since they gained the Louisiana Purchase) faced an overflow of native peoples in Missouri and Arkansas and were able to negotiate with the Caddoans to allow several displaced peoples to settle on unused lands in eastern Texas. They included the [[Muscogee]], [[Houma people|Houma Choctaw]], [[Lenape]] and [[Mingo | Mingo Seneca]], among others, who all came to view the Caddoans as saviors, making those peoples highly influential.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Glover, William B. \"A History of the Caddo Indians\".

Prior treaties with the Spanish forbade either side from militarizing its native population in any potential conflict between the two nations. At that time, several sudden outbreaks of violence between Caddoans and Texans started to spread. The Caddoans were always clueless{{speculation inline|date=March 2019}} when questioned, The Texan and American authorities in the region could never find hard evidence linking them to it and often it was so far-flung from Caddoan lands, it barely made any sense. It seems most likely that these were false-flag attacks meant to start a cascading effect to force the natives under Caddoan influence into armed conflict without breaking any treaties\u2014preferably on the side of the Spanish. While no proof was found as to who the culprit was, those in charge of Texas at the time attempted multiple times to publicly blame and punish the Caddoans for the incidents with the U.S. government trying to keep them in check. Furthermore, the Caddoans never turned to violence because of it, excepting cases of self-defense.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nBy the 1830s, the U.S. had drafted the Indian Removal Act, which was used to facilitate the Trail of Tears. Fearing retribution of other native peoples, Indian Agents all over the eastern U.S. began desperately trying to convince all their native peoples to uproot and move west. This included the Caddoans of Louisiana and Arkansas. Following the Texas Revolution, the Texans chose to make peace with their Native peoples but did not honor former land claims or agreements.

Statehood brought many new settlers. Because of the long Spanish presence in Mexico and various failed colonization efforts by the Spanish and Mexicans in northern Mexico, there were large herds of [[Texas Longhorn|Longhorn cattle]] that roamed the state. Hardy by nature, but also suitable for slaughtering and consumption, they represented an economic opportunity many entrepreneurs seized upon, thus creating the cowboy culture for which Texas is famous. While in the early days of the republic cattle and bison were slaughtered for their hides, soon a beef industry was established with cattle being shipped all over the U.S. and the Caribbean (within a few decades, beef had become a staple of the American diet).\n[[File:Texas proposed boundaries.svg|thumb|Proposed boundaries, 1850]]\n\nAfter Texas's annexation, Mexico broke diplomatic relations with the United States.

However, since the state had not been as dependent on slaves as other parts of the South, it was able to recover more quickly. The culture in Texas during the later 19th century exhibited many facets of a frontier territory. The state became notorious as a haven for people from other parts of the country who wanted to escape debt, criminal prosecution, or other problems. Indeed, \"Gone to Texas\" was a common expression for those fleeing the law in other states. Nevertheless, the state also attracted many businessmen and other settlers with more legitimate interests as well.\n\nThe cattle industry continued to thrive, though it gradually became less profitable. Cotton and lumber became major industries creating new economic booms in various regions of the state. Railroad networks grew rapidly as did the port at Galveston as commerce between Texas and the rest of the U.S. (and the rest of the world) expanded. As with some other states before, the lumber industry quickly decimated the [[History of Texas forests|forests of Texas]] such that, by the early 20th century, the majority of the forest population in Texas was gone (later conservation efforts restored some of it, but never to the level it once was).\n\n===Earlier 20th century===\n\n[[File:Lucas gusher.jpg|thumb|upright|Spindletop, the first major oil gusher]]\n\nIn 1900, Texas suffered the deadliest natural disaster in U.S. history during the [[1900 Galveston hurricane|Galveston hurricane]].<ref name=\"deadhurr\" /> On January 10, 1901, the first major [[oil well]] in Texas, [[Spindletop]], was found south of [[Beaumont, Texas|Beaumont]].

Lastly, more than 111,000 people are of other Asian ancestry groups, such as [[Cambodian American|Cambodian]], [[Thai American|Thai]], and [[Hmong American|Hmong]]. [[Sugar Land, TX|Sugar Land]], a city within the Houston metropolitan area, and [[Plano, TX|Plano]], within the Dallas metropolitan area, both have high concentrations of ethnic Chinese and Korean residents. The Houston and Dallas areas, and to a lesser extent, the Austin metropolitan area, all contain substantial Vietnamese communities.\n\nAmericans with origins from the Pacific Islands are the smallest minority in Texas. According to the survey, only 18,000 Texans are Pacific Islanders; 16,400 are of non-Hispanic descent. There are roughly 5,400 [[Native Hawaiians]], 5,300 Guamanians, and 6,400 people from other groups. [[Samoan American]]s were scant; only 2,920 people were from this group. The city of [[Euless]], a suburb of [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]], contains a sizable population of [[Tongan American]]s, at nearly 900 people, over one percent of the city's population. [[Killeen, Texas|Killeen]] has a sufficient population of Samoans and Guamanian, and people of Pacific Islander descent surpass one percent of the city's population.\n\nMultiracial individuals are also a visible minority in Texas. People identifying as multiracial form 1.9 percent of the population, and number over 448,000 people. Almost 80,000 Texans claim African and European heritage and makeup 0.3 percent of the population. People of European and American Indian ancestry number over 108,800 (close to the number of Native Americans), and makeup 0.5 percent of the population. People of European and Asian ancestry number over 57,600, and form just 0.2 percent of the population. People of African and Native American ancestry were even smaller in number (15,300), and makeup just 0.1 percent of the total population.\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 137-005007, Zeichnung, Deutscher Einwandererzug in Texas.jpg|thumb|German trek on its way to [[New Braunfels, Texas|New Braunfels]]]]\n\nHispanics and Latinos are the second-largest groups in Texas after non-Hispanic [[European American]]s. More than 8.5 million people claim Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. This group forms over 37 percent of Texas's population. People of [[Mexican American|Mexican]] descent alone number over 7.9 million, and make up 31.6 percent of the population.

A [[Slave and free states|slave state]] before the [[American Civil War]], Texas declared its secession from the U.S. in early 1861, and officially joined the [[Confederate States of America]] on March{{nbsp}}2 of the same year. After the Civil War and the restoration of its representation in the federal government, Texas entered a long period of economic stagnation.\n\nHistorically four major industries shaped the Texas economy prior to [[World War II]]: cattle and bison, cotton, timber, and oil.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ramos|first1=Mary G.|last2=Reavis|first2=Dick J.|title=Texas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EgCE8AHvYUQC&pg=PA125|year=2004|publisher=Fodor's Travel Publications|isbn=978-0-676-90502-1|page=125}}</ref> Before and after the U.S. Civil War the cattle industry, which Texas came to dominate, was a major economic driver for the state, thus creating the traditional image of the Texas cowboy. In the later 19th century cotton and lumber grew to be major industries as the cattle industry became less lucrative. It was ultimately, though, the discovery of major [[petroleum]] deposits ([[Spindletop]] in particular) that initiated an [[Texas oil boom|economic boom]] which became the driving force behind the economy for much of the 20th century. With strong investments in universities, Texas developed a diversified [[Economy of Texas|economy]] and [[high tech]] industry in the mid-20th century.

The [[continental crust]] forms a stable [[Mesoproterozoic]] [[craton]] which changes across a broad continental margin and transitional crust into true [[oceanic crust]] of the Gulf of Mexico. The oldest rocks in Texas date from the Mesoproterozoic and are about 1,600 million years old.\n\nThese [[Precambrian]] [[igneous]] and [[metamorphic rock]]s underlie most of the state, and are exposed in three places: [[Llano, Texas|Llano]] uplift, [[Van Horn, Texas|Van Horn]], and the [[Franklin Mountains (Texas)|Franklin Mountains]], near El Paso. [[Sedimentary rocks]] overlay most of these ancient rocks. The oldest sediments were deposited on the flanks of a rifted continental margin, or [[passive margin]] that developed during [[Cambrian]] time.\n\nThis margin existed until [[Laurasia]] and [[Gondwana]] collided in the [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]] subperiod to form [[Pangea]]. This is the buried crest of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]\u2013[[Ouachita Mountains]] zone of Pennsylvanian [[continental collision]]. This [[orogeny|orogenic]] crest is today buried beneath the Dallas\u2013[[Waco, Texas|Waco]]\u2014Austin\u2013San Antonio trend.\n\nThe late [[Paleozoic]] mountains collapsed as [[rifting]] in the [[Jurassic]] period began to open the Gulf of Mexico. Pangea began to break up in the [[Triassic]], but [[seafloor spreading]] to form the Gulf of Mexico occurred only in the mid- and [[late Jurassic]]. The shoreline shifted again to the eastern margin of the state and the Gulf of Mexico's passive margin began to form.

[[Archaeologists]] have found that three major indigenous cultures lived in this territory, and reached their developmental peak before the first European contact. These were:<ref name=\"Richardson\">Richardson (2005), p. 9.</ref>\n* the [[Ancestral Puebloans|Pueblo]] from the upper [[Rio Grande]] region, centered west of Texas;\n* the [[Mississippian culture]], also known as [[Mound Builders]], which extended along the [[Mississippi River Valley]] east of Texas; and\n* the civilizations of [[Mesoamerica]], centered south of Texas. Influence of [[Teotihuacan]] in northern Mexico peaked around AD 500 and declined over the 8th to 10th centuries.\n\nWhen Europeans arrived in the Texas region, there were several races of Native peoples divided into many smaller tribes. They were Caddoan, Atakapan, Athabaskan, Coahuiltecan, and Uto-Aztecan. The Uto-Aztecan Puebloan peoples lived neared the Rio Grande in the western portion of the state, the Athabaskan-speaking Apache tribes lived throughout the interior, the Caddoans controlled much of the Red River region and the Atakapans were mostly centered along the Gulf Coast. At least one tribe of Coahuiltecans, the [[Aranama]], lived in southern Texas. This entire culture group, primarily centered in northeastern Mexico, is now extinct. It is difficult to say who lived in the northwestern region of the state originally. By the time the region came to be explored, it belonged to the fairly well-known Comanche, another Uto-Aztecan people who had transitioned into a powerful horse culture, but it is believed that they came later and did not live there during the 16th century. It may have been claimed by several different peoples, including Uto-Aztecans, Athabaskans, or even Dhegihan Siouans.\n\nNo culture was dominant in the present-day Texas region, and many peoples inhabited the area.<ref name=\"Richardson\" /> Native American tribes who lived inside the boundaries of present-day Texas include the [[Alabama people|Alabama]], [[Apache]], [[Atakapa]]n, [[Bidai]], [[Caddo]], Aranama, [[Comanche]], [[Choctaw]], [[Coushatta]], [[Hasinai]], [[Jumano people|Jumano]], [[Karankawa people|Karankawa]], [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoo]], [[Kiowa]], [[Tonkawa]], and [[Wichita people|Wichita]].<ref>Richardson (2005), pp 10\u201316</ref><ref name=\"HoT bzi04\">{{cite Handbook of Texas|id=bzi04|title=Indians|first=George |last=Klos|date=June 15, 2010}}</ref> The name '''''Texas''''' derives from ''t\u00e1ysha\u0294'', a word in the [[Caddoan languages|Caddoan language]] of the ''Hasinai'', which means \"friends\" or \"allies\".<ref name=\"facts\">{{cite book |title=Facts |edition=2010\u20132011 |work=[[Texas Almanac]] |url=http://texasalmanac.com/topics/facts-profile |first=Robert |last=Plocheck |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110228054833/http://www.texasalmanac.com/topics/facts-profile |archivedate=February 28, 2011 |date=November 20, 2017 }}</ref><ref name=\"TribesofTexas\">{{cite Handbook of Texas |last=Fry |first=Phillip L. |title=Texas, Origin of Name |id=pft04 |orig-year=July 15, 2010 |date=March 7, 2016}}</ref><ref>Richardson, p 1</ref><ref name=\"etymology\">{{cite web |url=https://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Texas |title=Texas |accessdate=February 25, 2007 |website=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Douglas Harper}}</ref><ref name=\"WChafe\">Wallace Chafe, p.c.</ref>\n\nThe region was primarily controlled by the Spanish for the first couple centuries of contact, until the Texas Revolution. They were not particularly kind to their native populations\u2014even less so with the Caddoans, who were not trusted as their culture was split between the Spanish and the French. When the Spanish briefly managed to conquer the Louisiana colony, they decided to switch tactics and attempt being exceedingly friendly to the Indians, which they continued even after the French took back the colony. After the 1803 Louisiana Purchase, the United States inherited this odd circumstance. The Caddoans preferred the company of Americans{{According to whom|date=March 2019}} and almost the entire population of them migrated into the states of Louisiana and Arkansas. The Spanish felt jilted after having spent so much time and effort and began trying to lure the Caddo back, even promising them more land. Seemingly without actually knowing how they came by it,{{According to whom|date=March 2019}} the United States (who had begun convincing tribes to self-segregate from whites by selling everything and moving west ever since they gained the Louisiana Purchase) faced an overflow of native peoples in Missouri and Arkansas and were able to negotiate with the Caddoans to allow several displaced peoples to settle on unused lands in eastern Texas. They included the [[Muscogee]], [[Houma people|Houma Choctaw]], [[Lenape]] and [[Mingo | Mingo Seneca]], among others, who all came to view the Caddoans as saviors, making those peoples highly influential.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Glover, William B. \"A History of the Caddo Indians\".

Prior treaties with the Spanish forbade either side from militarizing its native population in any potential conflict between the two nations. At that time, several sudden outbreaks of violence between Caddoans and Texans started to spread. The Caddoans were always clueless{{speculation inline|date=March 2019}} when questioned, The Texan and American authorities in the region could never find hard evidence linking them to it and often it was so far-flung from Caddoan lands, it barely made any sense. It seems most likely that these were false-flag attacks meant to start a cascading effect to force the natives under Caddoan influence into armed conflict without breaking any treaties\u2014preferably on the side of the Spanish. While no proof was found as to who the culprit was, those in charge of Texas at the time attempted multiple times to publicly blame and punish the Caddoans for the incidents with the U.S. government trying to keep them in check. Furthermore, the Caddoans never turned to violence because of it, excepting cases of self-defense.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nBy the 1830s, the U.S. had drafted the Indian Removal Act, which was used to facilitate the Trail of Tears. Fearing retribution of other native peoples, Indian Agents all over the eastern U.S. began desperately trying to convince all their native peoples to uproot and move west. This included the Caddoans of Louisiana and Arkansas. Following the Texas Revolution, the Texans chose to make peace with their Native peoples but did not honor former land claims or agreements.

Statehood brought many new settlers. Because of the long Spanish presence in Mexico and various failed colonization efforts by the Spanish and Mexicans in northern Mexico, there were large herds of [[Texas Longhorn|Longhorn cattle]] that roamed the state. Hardy by nature, but also suitable for slaughtering and consumption, they represented an economic opportunity many entrepreneurs seized upon, thus creating the cowboy culture for which Texas is famous. While in the early days of the republic cattle and bison were slaughtered for their hides, soon a beef industry was established with cattle being shipped all over the U.S. and the Caribbean (within a few decades, beef had become a staple of the American diet).\n[[File:Texas proposed boundaries.svg|thumb|Proposed boundaries, 1850]]\n\nAfter Texas's annexation, Mexico broke diplomatic relations with the United States.

However, since the state had not been as dependent on slaves as other parts of the South, it was able to recover more quickly.

The state became notorious as a haven for people from other parts of the country who wanted to escape debt, criminal prosecution, or other problems. Indeed, \"Gone to Texas\" was a common expression for those fleeing the law in other states. Nevertheless, the state also attracted many businessmen and other settlers with more legitimate interests as well.\n\nThe cattle industry continued to thrive, though it gradually became less profitable.

Their proportion of the population has declined since the early 20th century after many left the state in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]]. Blacks of both Hispanic and non-Hispanic origin make up 11.5 percent of the population; blacks of non-Hispanic origin form 11.3 percent of the populace. African Americans of both Hispanic and non-Hispanic origin number at roughly 2.7 million individuals.\n\nNative Americans are a smaller minority in the state. Native Americans make up 0.5 percent of Texas's population and number over 118,000 individuals. Native Americans of non-Hispanic origin make up 0.3 percent of the population and number over 75,000 individuals. [[Cherokee]] made up 0.1 percent of the population, and numbered over 19,400. In contrast, only 583 identified as [[Chippewa]].\n[[File:Emory-El Paso.jpg|thumb|[[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]] was founded by Spanish settlers in 1659.]]\n\nAsian Americans are a sizable minority group in Texas. Americans of Asian descent form 3.8 percent of the population, with those of non-Hispanic descent making up 3.7 percent of the populace. They total more than 808,000 individuals. Non-Hispanic Asians number over 795,000. Just over 200,000 [[Indian American]]s make Texas their home. Texas is also home to more than 187,000 [[Vietnamese American|Vietnamese]] and 136,000 [[Chinese American|Chinese]]. In addition to 92,000 [[Filipino American|Filipinos]] and 62,000 [[Korean American|Koreans]], there are 18,000 [[Japanese American]]s living in the state. Lastly, more than 111,000 people are of other Asian ancestry groups, such as [[Cambodian American|Cambodian]], [[Thai American|Thai]], and [[Hmong American|Hmong]]. [[Sugar Land, TX|Sugar Land]], a city within the Houston metropolitan area, and [[Plano, TX|Plano]], within the Dallas metropolitan area, both have high concentrations of ethnic Chinese and Korean residents. The Houston and Dallas areas, and to a lesser extent, the Austin metropolitan area, all contain substantial Vietnamese communities.\n\nAmericans with origins from the Pacific Islands are the smallest minority in Texas. According to the survey, only 18,000 Texans are Pacific Islanders; 16,400 are of non-Hispanic descent. There are roughly 5,400 [[Native Hawaiians]], 5,300 Guamanians, and 6,400 people from other groups. [[Samoan American]]s were scant; only 2,920 people were from this group. The city of [[Euless]], a suburb of [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]], contains a sizable population of [[Tongan American]]s, at nearly 900 people, over one percent of the city's population. [[Killeen, Texas|Killeen]] has a sufficient population of Samoans and Guamanian, and people of Pacific Islander descent surpass one percent of the city's population.\n\nMultiracial individuals are also a visible minority in Texas. People identifying as multiracial form 1.9 percent of the population, and number over 448,000 people. Almost 80,000 Texans claim African and European heritage and makeup 0.3 percent of the population. People of European and American Indian ancestry number over 108,800 (close to the number of Native Americans), and makeup 0.5 percent of the population. People of European and Asian ancestry number over 57,600, and form just 0.2 percent of the population. People of African and Native American ancestry were even smaller in number (15,300), and makeup just 0.1 percent of the total population.\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 137-005007, Zeichnung, Deutscher Einwandererzug in Texas.jpg|thumb|German trek on its way to [[New Braunfels, Texas|New Braunfels]]]]\n\nHispanics and Latinos are the second-largest groups in Texas after non-Hispanic [[European American]]s.

He was originally a [[linotype machine|linotyper]] for the ''Daily Courier'' who became jealous of his boss's success; later, he becomes a criminal mastermind under the name Psycho-Pirate. He plans crimes based on emotions, hoping to ruin his boss. Nothing is known of the life of Charles Halstead before he became a linotyper at the ''Daily Courier''. A long-time employee, Halstead was a friend and favorite of publisher Rex Morgan. Secretly, however, Halstead was frustrated with his lack of advancement at the paper and, at some point, snapped. He resolved to take what he had never been able to earn and his first target was the paper itself. He began to stage a series of crimes based on emotions (hate, greed, etc.), cluing the ''Courier'' with leads to his crimes.\n\nAs time passed, Halstead, as the Psycho-Pirate, became bolder. He penned a letter to the ''Courier'', challenging the [[Justice Society]] to stop a new wave of crimes based on a variety of emotions. For example, he engendered fear into the inhabitants of a city where he threatened to unleash a deadly plague until his plan was halted by [[Dr. Mid-Nite]]. Each JSAer was given an emotion and a task to solve. With the JSA dispersed and only [[The Atom (Al Pratt)|the Atom]] to guard Halstead, the Psycho-Pirate began a campaign to demoralize the publisher with constant news of despair: business failure, divorce, foreclosure\u2014a series of lies designed to crush the spirit of his employer. To remove the Atom, he convinced the hero that the JSA had been captured and sent the Mighty Mite to rescue them. The Atom discovered the ruse and defeated the criminal's henchmen disguised as JSAers. In doing so, the Atom discovered the true identity of the Psycho-Pirate, who shot him to preserve his secrecy. Wounded, the Atom made it to the ''Courier'' just as the JSA returned and exposed Halstead as the Psycho-Pirate. Halstead was subsequently sentenced to a lengthy prison term after the Justice Society of America captured and put him in jail. He escaped by playing on the emotions of a guard, but the JSA heard of his plans from his cellmate and were able to recapture him. He continued to research the mysticism of emotions until his death sometime in the 1960s.\n\n===Roger Hayden===\nRoger Hayden first appeared as the second Psycho-Pirate in ''Showcase #56'', created by Gardner Fox and [[Murphy Anderson]].\n[[File:Showcase 56.jpg|thumbnail|left|The first appearance of the second '''Psycho-Pirate'''. Cover to ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' #56. Art by [[Murphy Anderson]].]]\n\nRoger Hayden is a jailed gangster (later [[retcon]]ned into a young 20-year-old who was sentenced to a year in prison for attacking his emotionally abusive psychiatrist father) who is a cellmate to Halstead on [[Earth-Two]].<ref>Earth-Two was established as a parallel world that served as the home of the [[Justice Society of America]], as well as other DC Comics characters introduced during the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]]. ''Flash'' (vol. 1) #123 (September 1961).</ref>  Halstead's dying wish, to have a legacy, prompts him to tell Hayden of a secret which he has divined in his jail years: the existence of the Medusa Masks. These golden masks bestow upon the wearer the power to project emotions onto others. Hayden finds these masks, merges them into a single faceplate and uses its powers to become a supervillain. It becomes increasingly apparent that he is addicted to absorbing others' emotions, though it causes him pain, possibly brought on by the combination of all of the masks into one. He is eventually imprisoned after a battle with  [[Doctor Fate]] and [[Hourman]].\n\nHayden returns to prominence when he insidiously begins influencing prominent [[Gotham City]] citizens [[Bruce Wayne]] and [[Alan Scott]]; Wayne is a former wealthy businessman and now commissioner of Gotham's police force and Scott is the president of the television station WXYZ. Initially, Scott is the most affected by Psycho Pirate as he, in his Green Lantern persona, begins exercising his frustrations upon humanity for the failures of his private life, such as the impending bankruptcy of his station. After creating a disturbance at Gotham International Airport, he is subdued by his [[Justice Society]] comrades, who assist both Scott and teammate [[Jay Garrick|Flash]], who had also been under Hayden's control. The Society has to next battle a civil war within their membership instigated by Wayne, still under Hayden's control and determined to rid Gotham of all superheroes.\n\nHayden later joins the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]], having been recruited by the [[Ultra-Humanite]] to defeat Hayden's old foe Hourman. While he is initially successful thanks to a device the Ultra-Humanite devises that amplifies and projects Hayden's face and hence his control, ultimately both the Justice Society and the [[Justice League]] defeat Hayden and his teammates after their betrayal of fellow Secret Society members. The villains are deposited into an interdimensional rift known as [[Limbo (DC Comics)|Limbo]].\n\nWhile in Limbo, the Ultra-Humanite gains mental contact with his younger self from the 1940s and the two {{not a typo|Ultra-Human|ites}} are able to pull the Secret Society, including Hayden, back to that era, where they confront and are defeated by the [[All-Star Squadron]] and the time-lost [[Infinity Inc.]]\n\n====''Crisis on Infinite Earths''====\nIn the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]], the [[Monitor (comics)|Monitor]] recruits Hayden\u2014who goes on to help [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]] recruit his enemy [[Killer Frost]] to the Monitor's team by making her fall in love with Firestorm\u2014but Hayden is quickly abducted by the [[Anti-Monitor]]. In exchange for an entire world and all of its inhabitants' emotions to play with, Psycho-Pirate becomes an accomplice to the Anti-Monitor, manipulating a captive [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]]. The Flash's powers are briefly enhanced so that Hayden can control the remaining three alternate Earths at the time (Earth-4, Earth-S, and Earth-X) so that their heroes are provoked into attacking teams sent to rescue them. Psycho Pirate's use of his powers on this scale causes him to \"burn out\" so that he cannot use his powers again afterward. Although the Anti-Monitor constantly belittles the Psycho-Pirate, he keeps him around in case his emotion-manipulating abilities prove useful later on and because he lacks the time to find or create someone else with the same powers. After the resolution of the Crisis, Psycho-Pirate is one of very few individuals to have full memories of the event. Driven mad by these memories, the Psycho-Pirate is shown in the last few panels of 'Crisis' in a straitjacket.\n\n====Post-''Crisis''====\nFollowing the events of ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', Hayden escapes Arkham Asylum and encounters a renegade 5th Dimension Thunderbolt genie who has merged with private investigator Jonnie Thunder. In the pages of ''Infinity, Inc.'' #30-34, the two bedevil the members of Infinity, Inc. in a bid to destroy Jonnie's mind so that the Thunderbolt can seize total control over her body. During the arc it is shown that the renegade Thunderbolt repeatedly electroshocked Psycho-Pirate upon recruiting him. Although this was done to \"cure\" Hayden of the madness he was suffering from, the electroshock had the side effect of making Psycho Pirate loses all memories of the ''Crisis'' and the existence of parallel Earths.\n\nDefeated, Hayden relocates to Markovia and impersonates the villain [[Baron Bedlam]] in order to gain power in the nation. In a story that spanned two specials (''Outsiders Special'' and ''Infinity, Inc. Special''), the Outsiders and Infinity, Inc. defeat and imprison Psycho-Pirate.\n\nHayden shows up again in [[Grant Morrison]]'s run on ''[[Animal Man]]'', imprisoned in [[Arkham Asylum]]. The effects of the electroshocks given to him by the renegade Thunderbolt have worn off and Hayden's memories of the ''Crisis'' and of the prior existence of multiple Earths are restored. Psycho Pirate ends up releasing characters destroyed during the ''Crisis'' back into the world, although many of these characters later come to realize they are just characters in a comic book. After an intervention by Animal Man, Hayden, seemingly happy, fades away into nothingness. Psycho Pirate's happiness is due to a relief of the strain from releasing all of the forgotten characters, but he is consequently removed from reality and placed back in [[Limbo (DC Comics)|Limbo]]. James Highwater, one of the Asylum staff, is left to wear the Medusa Mask and keep the forgotten Earths contained. The other staff members come to accept Highwater as a patient, not realizing his knowledge of the missing worlds.\n\nAt some point, the Medusa Mask is held by the [[Force of July]]. Abraham Lincoln Carlyle, who shelters the Force, claims to have gotten the mask from Hayden and to have learned how to use it by watching him. He tries to use the mask, unsuccessfully, against [[Shade, the Changing Man]] as his team falls under attack from the [[Suicide Squad]]; Carlyle's heart fails him, however, and he dies.<ref>''Suicide Squad'' #27, 1989</ref>\n\nPsycho-Pirate does not appear again until 1995 when he became part of the ''[[Underworld Unleashed]]'' crossover event. In this story Psycho-Pirate, along with several other villians, sells his soul to the demon [[Neron (DC Comics)|Neron]] in exchange for more power. The process results in a costume change for the character as well, with Hayden now wearing a black leather jacket and with the metal of his mask morphing into an eyepatch and replacing about half of his brain. Once again sane, and making no allusion to the events of ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' and the existence of the Multiverse, Psycho-Pirate goes on to fight the Chase Lawler version of [[Manhunter (comics)#Chase Lawler|Manhunter]] before being arrested and sent to jail.\n\nAfter his appearance in the ''Fate'' series, Psycho-Pirate makes two brief appearances during the ''Joker: Last Laugh'' crossover event. He is first seen locked up in the maximum security prison called the \"Slab\", where he is again insane and rambling of the existence of the Multiverse and is seen in his original costume. All but one eye of the Pirate's face is covered and his eyebrows have been shaved off to reduce his ability to express emotion. The [[Joker (character)|Joker]] initiates a breakout and infection of the inmates, causing them to follow his orders and commit dangerous pranks. Because of this control, Psycho Pirate is seen shouting \"Fire!\" in a crowded theatre during the breakout.\n\n====''Infinite Crisis''====\n{{Main|Infinite Crisis}}\nPsycho-Pirate reappears in the ''JSA Classified'' #1\u20134 story arc, in which he reveals that he and Power Girl are refugees from Earth-Two. Along with several other individuals (such as [[Donna Troy]] and her evil alter ego Dark Angel), both Psycho Pirate and Power Girl were \"missed\" in the restructuring of the Multiverse into a single universe following the events of ''Crisis on Infinite Earths.'' This revelation restores the original origin story of Power Girl as well.\n[[File:Deathpp.PNG|200px|left|Psycho-Pirate's death at the hands of [[Black Adam]]. Art by [[Phil Jimenez]].|thumb]]\nPsycho-Pirate hopes to weaken Power Girl mentally so that she can be captured as part of [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]]'s plot to unite and control characters who had originally been from universes destroyed during ''Crisis on Infinite Earths''. Failing at this, Psycho-Pirate flees and vows to make Power Girl his love slave once Luthor is finished with her.\n\nWhen [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]], [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]], and [[Wonder Girl]] attack Luthor's base, they free all the captive heroes, including Power Girl and [[Black Adam]], who are then confronted by the Psycho-Pirate. Black Adam proceeds to gouge out the Psycho-Pirate's eyes and pushes the Medusa Mask through his head, killing him.\n\nPsycho-Pirate is mentioned in ''Justice League of America'' #1 as selling emotional states, such as \"happy\" and \"ecstatic\", much like a drug dealer. Among his reported clients are [[Signalman (comics)|Signalman]] and Silver Ghost. Psycho-Pirate's Medusa Mask is also featured in the 2008 ''[[Raven (DC Comics)|Raven]]'' miniseries. In the story's conclusion, Raven destroyed the mask but its power still affected scientists who studied its schematics on a computer.\n\n===''Blackest Night''===\nIn the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' storyline, Psycho-Pirate has been identified as one of the deceased who are entombed below the [[Hall of Justice (comics)|Hall of Justice]].<ref>''Blackest Night'' #1 (July 2009)</ref> Psycho-Pirate's corpse is revived as a [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lantern]] during the event.<ref>''Blackest Night'' #3 (September 2009)</ref> He attacks Smallville, using his powers to manipulate the inhabitants and sway [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Conner Kent]] into attacking Superman. Psycho-Pirate murders several Smallville citizens after using his powers to enhance their emotions, as Black Lanterns enjoy attacking the emotionally overwrought.<ref>''Blackest Night: Superman'' #2 (2009)</ref>\n\nConner attacks Superman and aids the Black Lantern [[Kal-L|Superman from Earth 2]], however the effect of the mask wears off and Conner once more regains his senses. Clark and Conner decide to separate, with Conner confronting Psycho-Pirate. Conner manages to withstand his emotional manipulation attempts and steals the Medusa Mask, which has been reconstructed via the black ring. Using the artifact, Conner inspires hope, will, and compassion, ending the riots in Smallville. Psycho-Pirate is last seen retreating into a dark alley, followed by Conner. Conner then uses the Medusa Mask on Earth-2 Superman (Kal-L), causing the black rings to malfunction and turning both Psycho-Pirate and Kal-L back into inanimate corpses.<ref>''Blackest Night: Superman'' #3 (2009)</ref>\n\n===''The New 52''===\nIn September 2011, ''[[The New 52]]'' rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, a new Psycho-Pirate first appears in ''Superboy'' Vol. 6 #23 as a member of the Twenty, a group of people who are infected by [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]] with a psionic virus, thus giving them all psionic abilities. He was captured by the [[H.I.V.E.]] Queen, another member of the Twenty who had become a zealous devotee of Brainiac. Psycho-Pirate managed to escape and sought out the Medusa Mask, an artifact that he believed would protect him against other people with psychic powers. He then spent the next four years hiding other psychics from H.I.V.E. who were using the people they captured to power their operations in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]].<ref>''Action Comics'' Vol. 3 #24</ref>\n\nDuring the Psi-War storyline, the Psycho-Pirate appears and takes out [[Hector Hammond]] and the H.I.V.E. Queen, who were both fighting for control of the city. When [[Superman]] arrives at H.I.V.E.'s headquarters, Hayden confronts him and drains his mind too. Hayden is then surprised by [[Lois Lane]], who was infected with the same psionic virus by Senator Hume, yet another member of the Twenty. The two fight, with Hayden getting the upper hand. He then proceeds to make Metropolis' citizens act on pure emotion, creating riots and chaos throughout the streets. A recovered Superman, Lois Lane, Hector Hammond, and the H.I.V.E. Queen then team up to fight the Pirate and a fierce battle ensues, during which the Queen and Hammond are beaten. Superman manages to pull the Medusa Mask off of Hayden's face and incinerates it with his heat vision, defeating the Psycho-Pirate. Hayden, however, disappears in the aftermath of the battle.<ref>''Superman'' Vol. 3 #23-24</ref>\n\nAt the same time as he was clashing with Superman, Roger Hayden also sent an astral projection to confront [[Superboy]] and [[Doctor Psycho]] who are in [[New York City]] looking for a psychic called Shift. Shift reveals that Psycho was only manipulating Superboy to get his power. A three-way battle ensues between the three characters, which ends with Doctor Psycho being defeated and Superboy falling unconscious, only to wake up in a cell powerless.<ref>''Superboy'' Vol. 6 #23-24</ref>\n\n===''DC Rebirth''===\nPsycho-Pirate and [[Hugo Strange]] are sent to [[Gotham City|Gotham]] as part of [[Amanda Waller]]'s [[Task Force X]]. As soon as they arrive, Hugo Strange deviates from their mission and uses Psycho-Pirate to infect Gotham City's newest heroes, Gotham and Gotham Girl, with overwhelming rage and fear, respectively, causing Gotham to go on a murderous rampage. With this accomplished, Strange trades the Psycho-Pirate to [[Bane (DC Comics)|Bane]], who wants the Pirate to help him overcome the horrors of his childhood and his addiction to Venom. When [[Batman]] learns of this, he forms his own Suicide Squad with the [[Bronze Tiger]], the [[Ventriloquist (comics)|Ventriloquist]], [[Catwoman]], and [[Punch and Jewelee]]. Together, they infiltrate Bane's prison fortress on the island of [[Santa Prisca (DC Comics)|Santa Prisca]] and retrieve the Psycho-Pirate. Batman returns the Pirate to Gotham City and uses him to reverse the emotional damage that he did to Gotham Girl.<ref>''Batman'' (2016-) Vol. #1-3</ref>\n\nThe Medusa Mask is taken into Batman's custody. When Batman accidentally puts the blood-stained smiley face button from the corpse of Edward Blake (the Comedian) left in Batman's Batcave by Dr. Manhattan, next to the Medusa Mask, both artifacts create an energy reaction that attracts the attention of the [[Eobard Thawne|Reverse Flash (Eobard Thawne).]] The Reverse Flash is then killed by Dr. Manhattan, but not before the Medusa Mask manifests the erased-from-existence [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]]; who frantically attempts to warn Batman and Flash of Manhattan's evil scheme to alter the timeline so as to eliminate the Justice League and a create a darker, more cynical Superman, and a version of the Flashpoint Universe Thomas Wayne, who begs Batman to give up his costumed identity for a normal existence.<ref>''Batman'' #20-21 and ''Flash'' #20-21</ref>\n\nShortly after those events, Hayden has the Medusa Mask returned to him by agents of Bane. From there, it is revealed in the wake of the aborted Batman and Catwoman wedding that Hugo Strange, Psycho-Pirate and Gotham Girl were actually working together in secret with Bane, and that Psycho-Pirate has resurrected the ''Flashpoint'' Batman from the dead to aid in Bane's scheme.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nCharles Halstead has no superhuman powers, however, he is a brilliant criminal mind with an excellent grasp of human psychology and emotions.\n\nWith the Medusa Mask, Roger Hayden is able to project emotions onto people. Often it seems to intensify emotions that a person already feels, no matter how small. Hayden later shows the power to manifest DC Multiverse characters that had been destroyed during the ''Crisis on Infinite Earths''; this power expands to any Multiverse character, including the still-living. Psycho-Pirate has also shown some sort of regeneration of body control, as he is able to reform after being crushed by Power Girl, and also disguises himself as a Legion flight ring.\n\nDuring his '90s revamp, Psycho-Pirate was an \"psychic vampire\", able to drain emotions from people.\n\nFollowing the ''New 52'' reboot, Roger Hayden is depicted as a psychic who specializes in telepathically manipulating people's emotions. Examples include: calming a person to make them more reasonable or amplifying negative emotions such as fear or anger to the point of sending people into a murderous frenzy. While wearing the Medusa Mask, Hayden's emotion-manipulating powers were increased to the point where he could control all of Metropolis without straining himself. The mask also provided him with a number of other abilities, including shielding his mind against intrusion from other telepaths, levitation, draining other psi-powered individuals of their mental energies to increase his own, projecting psionic constructs in the form of giant orange snakes which he used to attack, forming a psychic link with another person, projecting his mind over tremendous distances (essentially granting him omnipresence), deflecting psionic attacks, projecting bolts of psionic energy and creating illusions.\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* In ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', the Roger Hayden version of Psycho-Pirate makes a cameo appearance as a member of [[Gorilla Grodd]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Secret Society]]. He has no lines and takes no significant action in any episode. Notably, he is lacking the Medusa Mask.\n* The Roger Hayden incarnation of Psycho-Pirate appears in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', voiced by [[Armin Shimerman]]. In the episode \"Inside the Outsiders\", he is a sadist who kidnaps the group of teenage heroes known as the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]] ([[Black Lightning]], [[Katana (comics)|Katana]] and [[Metamorpho]]) and feeds off their rage caused by twisted nightmares. Batman goes inside their minds to save them, but Psycho-Pirate fakes his victory, almost causing Batman to feed him rage by pretending to kill the Outsiders. Batman realizes this, and thinks positive thoughts, starving the villain, and defeating him. Psycho-Pirate also made a cameo appearance in \"Mayhem of the Music Meister\" in the musical number \"Drives Us Bats\", as one of the patients at Arkham Asylum mesmerized into singing by the [[Music Meister]].\n* In the ''[[Constantine (TV series)|Constantine]]'' episode \"Blessed are the Damned\", the Medusa Mask is briefly seen among the artifacts stored in Jasper Winter's house.\n* In ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'' episode \"Nora\", [[Nora West-Allen]] reveals a newspaper from 2049 to her father, [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|Barry Allen]] about his disappearance in 2024. The newspaper includes a quote from Roger Hayden a.k.a. Psycho-Pirate, who claims to remember the events of the Flash's final battle with the [[Eobard Thawne (Arrowverse)|Reverse-Flash]] and Flash's disappearance, who says, \"Worlds lived, worlds died. Nothing will ever be the same.\"\n* The Roger Hayden incarnation of Psycho-Pirate made his live action debut in the DCTV crossover \"[[Elseworlds (Arrowverse)|Elseworlds]]\", portrayed by [[Bob Frazer]].<ref name=\"Frazer\">{{cite web |url=https://ew.com/tv/2018/11/02/arrowverse-elseworlds-crossover-psycho-pirate/ |title=Arrowverse 'Elseworlds' crossover to feature DC villain Psycho-Pirate |last=Agard |first=Chancellor |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=November 2, 2018 |accessdate=November 2, 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181102211618/https://ew.com/tv/2018/11/02/arrowverse-elseworlds-crossover-psycho-pirate/ |archivedate=November 2, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> In the second part of the crossover, Hayden is part of a group of inmates attempting to escape from [[Arkham Asylum]] after being released by [[Doctor Destiny|John Deegan]] before being stopped by [[Batwoman]]. In the final part, he reappears in his cell with his signature mask with a disfigured Deegan as his neighbor, cryptically quoting, \"Worlds will live, worlds will die and the universe [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|will never be the same]].\"\n\n===Video games===\n*The Roger Hayden version of Psycho-Pirate appears as a playable character in ''[[Lego DC Super-Villains]]'', with Armin Shimerman reprising the role from the ''Batman: The Brave and the Bold'' series.\n\n===Miscellaneous===\n* In the ''Justice League Adventures'' Issue #20 story \"Emotional Baggage\", Roger Hayden is a former psychiatrist (suspended for malpractice) whose wife and son died during an alien attack in Metropolis that the Justice League was involved in. He blames the League for this, displacing his own guilt. To exact revenge, he steals the Medusa Mask and becomes the Psycho-Pirate, first turning civilians against the League and then using the members' deeply hidden resentments to turn them against each other. By shape-shifting the emotion centers of his brain, Martian Manhunter frees himself and stops the Pirate's rampage by going into Hayden's memories of his family. Hayden is later seen in a straitjacket after this; doctors believe that the Medusa Mask has driven him insane. However, the \"horrors\" they say he is experiencing in his mind turn out to be him telling his wife and son that he loves them.\n* Psycho-Pirate appears as the primary antagonist of a special one-shot ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' issue published for [[Free Comic Book Day]]. He is shown working with [[Atomic Skull]] as part of a scheme to steal [[plutonium]] from a [[STAR Labs]] facility. Psycho-Pirate uses his Medusa Mask to force [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]], [[Miss Martian]], [[Aqualad (Jackson Hyde)|Aqualad]], [[Robin (Dick Grayson)|Robin]], and [[Kid Flash (Wally West)|Kid Flash]] to confront their inner demons, but is defeated and captured when Kid Flash breaks out of the illusion and removes the Medusa Mask from Psycho-Pirate's face.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.dialbforblog.com/archives/193 Fanpage about the Psycho-Pirate (both Halstead and Hayden)]\n{{Timeline\n|before= \u2190 The character Solomon Grundy was debuted by Alfred Bester and Paul Reinman.

He was originally a [[linotype machine|linotyper]] for the ''Daily Courier'' who became jealous of his boss's success; later, he becomes a criminal mastermind under the name Psycho-Pirate. He plans crimes based on emotions, hoping to ruin his boss. Nothing is known of the life of Charles Halstead before he became a linotyper at the ''Daily Courier''. A long-time employee, Halstead was a friend and favorite of publisher Rex Morgan. Secretly, however, Halstead was frustrated with his lack of advancement at the paper and, at some point, snapped. He resolved to take what he had never been able to earn and his first target was the paper itself. He began to stage a series of crimes based on emotions (hate, greed, etc.), cluing the ''Courier'' with leads to his crimes.\n\nAs time passed, Halstead, as the Psycho-Pirate, became bolder. He penned a letter to the ''Courier'', challenging the [[Justice Society]] to stop a new wave of crimes based on a variety of emotions. For example, he engendered fear into the inhabitants of a city where he threatened to unleash a deadly plague until his plan was halted by [[Dr. Mid-Nite]]. Each JSAer was given an emotion and a task to solve. With the JSA dispersed and only [[The Atom (Al Pratt)|the Atom]] to guard Halstead, the Psycho-Pirate began a campaign to demoralize the publisher with constant news of despair: business failure, divorce, foreclosure\u2014a series of lies designed to crush the spirit of his employer. To remove the Atom, he convinced the hero that the JSA had been captured and sent the Mighty Mite to rescue them. The Atom discovered the ruse and defeated the criminal's henchmen disguised as JSAers. In doing so, the Atom discovered the true identity of the Psycho-Pirate, who shot him to preserve his secrecy. Wounded, the Atom made it to the ''Courier'' just as the JSA returned and exposed Halstead as the Psycho-Pirate. Halstead was subsequently sentenced to a lengthy prison term after the Justice Society of America captured and put him in jail. He escaped by playing on the emotions of a guard, but the JSA heard of his plans from his cellmate and were able to recapture him. He continued to research the mysticism of emotions until his death sometime in the 1960s.\n\n===Roger Hayden===\nRoger Hayden first appeared as the second Psycho-Pirate in ''Showcase #56'', created by Gardner Fox and [[Murphy Anderson]].\n[[File:Showcase 56.jpg|thumbnail|left|The first appearance of the second '''Psycho-Pirate'''. Cover to ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' #56. Art by [[Murphy Anderson]].]]\n\nRoger Hayden is a jailed gangster (later [[retcon]]ned into a young 20-year-old who was sentenced to a year in prison for attacking his emotionally abusive psychiatrist father) who is a cellmate to Halstead on [[Earth-Two]].<ref>Earth-Two was established as a parallel world that served as the home of the [[Justice Society of America]], as well as other DC Comics characters introduced during the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]]. ''Flash'' (vol. 1) #123 (September 1961).</ref>  Halstead's dying wish, to have a legacy, prompts him to tell Hayden of a secret which he has divined in his jail years: the existence of the Medusa Masks. These golden masks bestow upon the wearer the power to project emotions onto others. Hayden finds these masks, merges them into a single faceplate and uses its powers to become a supervillain. It becomes increasingly apparent that he is addicted to absorbing others' emotions, though it causes him pain, possibly brought on by the combination of all of the masks into one. He is eventually imprisoned after a battle with  [[Doctor Fate]] and [[Hourman]].\n\nHayden returns to prominence when he insidiously begins influencing prominent [[Gotham City]] citizens [[Bruce Wayne]] and [[Alan Scott]]; Wayne is a former wealthy businessman and now commissioner of Gotham's police force and Scott is the president of the television station WXYZ. Initially, Scott is the most affected by Psycho Pirate as he, in his Green Lantern persona, begins exercising his frustrations upon humanity for the failures of his private life, such as the impending bankruptcy of his station. After creating a disturbance at Gotham International Airport, he is subdued by his [[Justice Society]] comrades, who assist both Scott and teammate [[Jay Garrick|Flash]], who had also been under Hayden's control. The Society has to next battle a civil war within their membership instigated by Wayne, still under Hayden's control and determined to rid Gotham of all superheroes.\n\nHayden later joins the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]], having been recruited by the [[Ultra-Humanite]] to defeat Hayden's old foe Hourman. While he is initially successful thanks to a device the Ultra-Humanite devises that amplifies and projects Hayden's face and hence his control, ultimately both the Justice Society and the [[Justice League]] defeat Hayden and his teammates after their betrayal of fellow Secret Society members. The villains are deposited into an interdimensional rift known as [[Limbo (DC Comics)|Limbo]].\n\nWhile in Limbo, the Ultra-Humanite gains mental contact with his younger self from the 1940s and the two {{not a typo|Ultra-Human|ites}} are able to pull the Secret Society, including Hayden, back to that era, where they confront and are defeated by the [[All-Star Squadron]] and the time-lost [[Infinity Inc.]]\n\n====''Crisis on Infinite Earths''====\nIn the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]], the [[Monitor (comics)|Monitor]] recruits Hayden\u2014who goes on to help [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]] recruit his enemy [[Killer Frost]] to the Monitor's team by making her fall in love with Firestorm\u2014but Hayden is quickly abducted by the [[Anti-Monitor]]. In exchange for an entire world and all of its inhabitants' emotions to play with, Psycho-Pirate becomes an accomplice to the Anti-Monitor, manipulating a captive [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]]. The Flash's powers are briefly enhanced so that Hayden can control the remaining three alternate Earths at the time (Earth-4, Earth-S, and Earth-X) so that their heroes are provoked into attacking teams sent to rescue them. Psycho Pirate's use of his powers on this scale causes him to \"burn out\" so that he cannot use his powers again afterward. Although the Anti-Monitor constantly belittles the Psycho-Pirate, he keeps him around in case his emotion-manipulating abilities prove useful later on and because he lacks the time to find or create someone else with the same powers. After the resolution of the Crisis, Psycho-Pirate is one of very few individuals to have full memories of the event. Driven mad by these memories, the Psycho-Pirate is shown in the last few panels of 'Crisis' in a straitjacket.\n\n====Post-''Crisis''====\nFollowing the events of ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', Hayden escapes Arkham Asylum and encounters a renegade 5th Dimension Thunderbolt genie who has merged with private investigator Jonnie Thunder. In the pages of ''Infinity, Inc.'' #30-34, the two bedevil the members of Infinity, Inc. in a bid to destroy Jonnie's mind so that the Thunderbolt can seize total control over her body. During the arc it is shown that the renegade Thunderbolt repeatedly electroshocked Psycho-Pirate upon recruiting him. Although this was done to \"cure\" Hayden of the madness he was suffering from, the electroshock had the side effect of making Psycho Pirate loses all memories of the ''Crisis'' and the existence of parallel Earths.\n\nDefeated, Hayden relocates to Markovia and impersonates the villain [[Baron Bedlam]] in order to gain power in the nation. In a story that spanned two specials (''Outsiders Special'' and ''Infinity, Inc. Special''), the Outsiders and Infinity, Inc. defeat and imprison Psycho-Pirate.\n\nHayden shows up again in [[Grant Morrison]]'s run on ''[[Animal Man]]'', imprisoned in [[Arkham Asylum]]. The effects of the electroshocks given to him by the renegade Thunderbolt have worn off and Hayden's memories of the ''Crisis'' and of the prior existence of multiple Earths are restored. Psycho Pirate ends up releasing characters destroyed during the ''Crisis'' back into the world, although many of these characters later come to realize they are just characters in a comic book. After an intervention by Animal Man, Hayden, seemingly happy, fades away into nothingness. Psycho Pirate's happiness is due to a relief of the strain from releasing all of the forgotten characters, but he is consequently removed from reality and placed back in [[Limbo (DC Comics)|Limbo]]. James Highwater, one of the Asylum staff, is left to wear the Medusa Mask and keep the forgotten Earths contained. The other staff members come to accept Highwater as a patient, not realizing his knowledge of the missing worlds.\n\nAt some point, the Medusa Mask is held by the [[Force of July]]. Abraham Lincoln Carlyle, who shelters the Force, claims to have gotten the mask from Hayden and to have learned how to use it by watching him. He tries to use the mask, unsuccessfully, against [[Shade, the Changing Man]] as his team falls under attack from the [[Suicide Squad]]; Carlyle's heart fails him, however, and he dies.<ref>''Suicide Squad'' #27, 1989</ref>\n\nPsycho-Pirate does not appear again until 1995 when he became part of the ''[[Underworld Unleashed]]'' crossover event. In this story Psycho-Pirate, along with several other villians, sells his soul to the demon [[Neron (DC Comics)|Neron]] in exchange for more power. The process results in a costume change for the character as well, with Hayden now wearing a black leather jacket and with the metal of his mask morphing into an eyepatch and replacing about half of his brain. Once again sane, and making no allusion to the events of ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' and the existence of the Multiverse, Psycho-Pirate goes on to fight the Chase Lawler version of [[Manhunter (comics)#Chase Lawler|Manhunter]] before being arrested and sent to jail.\n\nAfter his appearance in the ''Fate'' series, Psycho-Pirate makes two brief appearances during the ''Joker: Last Laugh'' crossover event. He is first seen locked up in the maximum security prison called the \"Slab\", where he is again insane and rambling of the existence of the Multiverse and is seen in his original costume. All but one eye of the Pirate's face is covered and his eyebrows have been shaved off to reduce his ability to express emotion. The [[Joker (character)|Joker]] initiates a breakout and infection of the inmates, causing them to follow his orders and commit dangerous pranks. Because of this control, Psycho Pirate is seen shouting \"Fire!\" in a crowded theatre during the breakout.\n\n====''Infinite Crisis''====\n{{Main|Infinite Crisis}}\nPsycho-Pirate reappears in the ''JSA Classified'' #1\u20134 story arc, in which he reveals that he and Power Girl are refugees from Earth-Two. Along with several other individuals (such as [[Donna Troy]] and her evil alter ego Dark Angel), both Psycho Pirate and Power Girl were \"missed\" in the restructuring of the Multiverse into a single universe following the events of ''Crisis on Infinite Earths.'' This revelation restores the original origin story of Power Girl as well.\n[[File:Deathpp.PNG|200px|left|Psycho-Pirate's death at the hands of [[Black Adam]]. Art by [[Phil Jimenez]].|thumb]]\nPsycho-Pirate hopes to weaken Power Girl mentally so that she can be captured as part of [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]]'s plot to unite and control characters who had originally been from universes destroyed during ''Crisis on Infinite Earths''. Failing at this, Psycho-Pirate flees and vows to make Power Girl his love slave once Luthor is finished with her.\n\nWhen [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]], [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]], and [[Wonder Girl]] attack Luthor's base, they free all the captive heroes, including Power Girl and [[Black Adam]], who are then confronted by the Psycho-Pirate. Black Adam proceeds to gouge out the Psycho-Pirate's eyes and pushes the Medusa Mask through his head, killing him.\n\nPsycho-Pirate is mentioned in ''Justice League of America'' #1 as selling emotional states, such as \"happy\" and \"ecstatic\", much like a drug dealer. Among his reported clients are [[Signalman (comics)|Signalman]] and Silver Ghost. Psycho-Pirate's Medusa Mask is also featured in the 2008 ''[[Raven (DC Comics)|Raven]]'' miniseries. In the story's conclusion, Raven destroyed the mask but its power still affected scientists who studied its schematics on a computer.\n\n===''Blackest Night''===\nIn the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' storyline, Psycho-Pirate has been identified as one of the deceased who are entombed below the [[Hall of Justice (comics)|Hall of Justice]].<ref>''Blackest Night'' #1 (July 2009)</ref> Psycho-Pirate's corpse is revived as a [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lantern]] during the event.<ref>''Blackest Night'' #3 (September 2009)</ref> He attacks Smallville, using his powers to manipulate the inhabitants and sway [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Conner Kent]] into attacking Superman.

Clark and Conner decide to separate, with Conner confronting Psycho-Pirate. Conner manages to withstand his emotional manipulation attempts and steals the Medusa Mask, which has been reconstructed via the black ring. Using the artifact, Conner inspires hope, will, and compassion, ending the riots in Smallville. Psycho-Pirate is last seen retreating into a dark alley, followed by Conner. Conner then uses the Medusa Mask on Earth-2 Superman (Kal-L), causing the black rings to malfunction and turning both Psycho-Pirate and Kal-L back into inanimate corpses.<ref>''Blackest Night: Superman'' #3 (2009)</ref>\n\n===''The New 52''===\nIn September 2011, ''[[The New 52]]'' rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, a new Psycho-Pirate first appears in ''Superboy'' Vol. 6 #23 as a member of the Twenty, a group of people who are infected by [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]] with a psionic virus, thus giving them all psionic abilities. He was captured by the [[H.I.V.E.]] Queen, another member of the Twenty who had become a zealous devotee of Brainiac. Psycho-Pirate managed to escape and sought out the Medusa Mask, an artifact that he believed would protect him against other people with psychic powers. He then spent the next four years hiding other psychics from H.I.V.E. who were using the people they captured to power their operations in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]].<ref>''Action Comics'' Vol. 3 #24</ref>\n\nDuring the Psi-War storyline, the Psycho-Pirate appears and takes out [[Hector Hammond]] and the H.I.V.E. Queen, who were both fighting for control of the city. When [[Superman]] arrives at H.I.V.E.'s headquarters, Hayden confronts him and drains his mind too. Hayden is then surprised by [[Lois Lane]], who was infected with the same psionic virus by Senator Hume, yet another member of the Twenty. The two fight, with Hayden getting the upper hand. He then proceeds to make Metropolis' citizens act on pure emotion, creating riots and chaos throughout the streets. A recovered Superman, Lois Lane, Hector Hammond, and the H.I.V.E. Queen then team up to fight the Pirate and a fierce battle ensues, during which the Queen and Hammond are beaten. Superman manages to pull the Medusa Mask off of Hayden's face and incinerates it with his heat vision, defeating the Psycho-Pirate. Hayden, however, disappears in the aftermath of the battle.<ref>''Superman'' Vol. 3 #23-24</ref>\n\nAt the same time as he was clashing with Superman, Roger Hayden also sent an astral projection to confront [[Superboy]] and [[Doctor Psycho]] who are in [[New York City]] looking for a psychic called Shift. Shift reveals that Psycho was only manipulating Superboy to get his power. A three-way battle ensues between the three characters, which ends with Doctor Psycho being defeated and Superboy falling unconscious, only to wake up in a cell powerless.<ref>''Superboy'' Vol. 6 #23-24</ref>\n\n===''DC Rebirth''===\nPsycho-Pirate and [[Hugo Strange]] are sent to [[Gotham City|Gotham]] as part of [[Amanda Waller]]'s [[Task Force X]]. As soon as they arrive, Hugo Strange deviates from their mission and uses Psycho-Pirate to infect Gotham City's newest heroes, Gotham and Gotham Girl, with overwhelming rage and fear, respectively, causing Gotham to go on a murderous rampage. With this accomplished, Strange trades the Psycho-Pirate to [[Bane (DC Comics)|Bane]], who wants the Pirate to help him overcome the horrors of his childhood and his addiction to Venom. When [[Batman]] learns of this, he forms his own Suicide Squad with the [[Bronze Tiger]], the [[Ventriloquist (comics)|Ventriloquist]], [[Catwoman]], and [[Punch and Jewelee]]. Together, they infiltrate Bane's prison fortress on the island of [[Santa Prisca (DC Comics)|Santa Prisca]] and retrieve the Psycho-Pirate. Batman returns the Pirate to Gotham City and uses him to reverse the emotional damage that he did to Gotham Girl.<ref>''Batman'' (2016-) Vol. #1-3</ref>\n\nThe Medusa Mask is taken into Batman's custody. When Batman accidentally puts the blood-stained smiley face button from the corpse of Edward Blake (the Comedian) left in Batman's Batcave by Dr. Manhattan, next to the Medusa Mask, both artifacts create an energy reaction that attracts the attention of the [[Eobard Thawne|Reverse Flash (Eobard Thawne).]] The Reverse Flash is then killed by Dr. Manhattan, but not before the Medusa Mask manifests the erased-from-existence [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]]; who frantically attempts to warn Batman and Flash of Manhattan's evil scheme to alter the timeline so as to eliminate the Justice League and a create a darker, more cynical Superman, and a version of the Flashpoint Universe Thomas Wayne, who begs Batman to give up his costumed identity for a normal existence.<ref>''Batman'' #20-21 and ''Flash'' #20-21</ref>\n\nShortly after those events, Hayden has the Medusa Mask returned to him by agents of Bane. From there, it is revealed in the wake of the aborted Batman and Catwoman wedding that Hugo Strange, Psycho-Pirate and Gotham Girl were actually working together in secret with Bane, and that Psycho-Pirate has resurrected the ''Flashpoint'' Batman from the dead to aid in Bane's scheme.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nCharles Halstead has no superhuman powers, however, he is a brilliant criminal mind with an excellent grasp of human psychology and emotions.\n\nWith the Medusa Mask, Roger Hayden is able to project emotions onto people. Often it seems to intensify emotions that a person already feels, no matter how small. Hayden later shows the power to manifest DC Multiverse characters that had been destroyed during the Crisis on Infinite Earths; this power expands to any Multiverse character, including the still-living. Psycho-Pirate has also shown some sort of regeneration of body control, as he is able to reform after being crushed by Power Girl, and also disguises himself as a Legion flight ring.\n\nDuring his '90s revamp, Psycho-Pirate was an \"psychic vampire\", able to drain emotions from people.\n\nFollowing the ''New 52'' reboot, Roger Hayden is depicted as a psychic who specializes in telepathically manipulating people's emotions. Examples include: calming a person to make them more reasonable or amplifying negative emotions such as fear or anger to the point of sending people into a murderous frenzy. While wearing the Medusa Mask, Hayden's emotion-manipulating powers were increased to the point where he could control all of Metropolis without straining himself. The mask also provided him with a number of other abilities, including shielding his mind against intrusion from other telepaths, levitation, draining other psi-powered individuals of their mental energies to increase his own, projecting psionic constructs in the form of giant orange snakes which he used to attack, forming a psychic link with another person, projecting his mind over tremendous distances (essentially granting him omnipresence), deflecting psionic attacks, projecting bolts of psionic energy and creating illusions.\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* In ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', the Roger Hayden version of Psycho-Pirate makes a cameo appearance as a member of [[Gorilla Grodd]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Secret Society]]. He has no lines and takes no significant action in any episode. Notably, he is lacking the Medusa Mask.\n* The Roger Hayden incarnation of Psycho-Pirate appears in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', voiced by [[Armin Shimerman]]. In the episode \"Inside the Outsiders\", he is a sadist who kidnaps the group of teenage heroes known as the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]] ([[Black Lightning]], [[Katana (comics)|Katana]] and [[Metamorpho]]) and feeds off their rage caused by twisted nightmares. Batman goes inside their minds to save them, but Psycho-Pirate fakes his victory, almost causing Batman to feed him rage by pretending to kill the Outsiders. Batman realizes this, and thinks positive thoughts, starving the villain, and defeating him. Psycho-Pirate also made a cameo appearance in \"Mayhem of the Music Meister\" in the musical number \"Drives Us Bats\", as one of the patients at Arkham Asylum mesmerized into singing by the [[Music Meister]].\n* In the ''[[Constantine (TV series)|Constantine]]'' episode \"Blessed are the Damned\", the Medusa Mask is briefly seen among the artifacts stored in Jasper Winter's house.\n* In ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'' episode \"Nora\", [[Nora West-Allen]] reveals a newspaper from 2049 to her father, [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|Barry Allen]] about his disappearance in 2024. The newspaper includes a quote from Roger Hayden a.k.a. Psycho-Pirate, who claims to remember the events of the Flash's final battle with the [[Eobard Thawne (Arrowverse)|Reverse-Flash]] and Flash's disappearance, who says, \"Worlds lived, worlds died. Nothing will ever be the same.\"\n* The Roger Hayden incarnation of Psycho-Pirate made his live action debut in the DCTV crossover \"[[Elseworlds (Arrowverse)|Elseworlds]]\", portrayed by [[Bob Frazer]].<ref name=\"Frazer\">{{cite web |url=https://ew.com/tv/2018/11/02/arrowverse-elseworlds-crossover-psycho-pirate/ |title=Arrowverse 'Elseworlds' crossover to feature DC villain Psycho-Pirate |last=Agard |first=Chancellor |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=November 2, 2018 |accessdate=November 2, 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181102211618/https://ew.com/tv/2018/11/02/arrowverse-elseworlds-crossover-psycho-pirate/ |archivedate=November 2, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> In the second part of the crossover, Hayden is part of a group of inmates attempting to escape from [[Arkham Asylum]] after being released by [[Doctor Destiny|John Deegan]] before being stopped by [[Batwoman]]. In the final part, he reappears in his cell with his signature mask with a disfigured Deegan as his neighbor, cryptically quoting, \"Worlds will live, worlds will die and the universe [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|will never be the same]].\"\n\n===Video games===\n*The Roger Hayden version of Psycho-Pirate appears as a playable character in ''[[Lego DC Super-Villains]]'', with Armin Shimerman reprising the role from the ''Batman: The Brave and the Bold'' series.\n\n===Miscellaneous===\n* In the ''Justice League Adventures'' Issue #20 story \"Emotional Baggage\", Roger Hayden is a former psychiatrist (suspended for malpractice) whose wife and son died during an alien attack in Metropolis that the Justice League was involved in. He blames the League for this, displacing his own guilt. To exact revenge, he steals the Medusa Mask and becomes the Psycho-Pirate, first turning civilians against the League and then using the members' deeply hidden resentments to turn them against each other. By shape-shifting the emotion centers of his brain, Martian Manhunter frees himself and stops the Pirate's rampage by going into Hayden's memories of his family. Hayden is later seen in a straitjacket after this; doctors believe that the Medusa Mask has driven him insane. However, the \"horrors\" they say he is experiencing in his mind turn out to be him telling his wife and son that he loves them.\n* Psycho-Pirate appears as the primary antagonist of a special one-shot ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' issue published for [[Free Comic Book Day]]. He is shown working with [[Atomic Skull]] as part of a scheme to steal [[plutonium]] from a [[STAR Labs]] facility. Psycho-Pirate uses his Medusa Mask to force [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]], [[Miss Martian]], [[Aqualad (Jackson Hyde)|Aqualad]], [[Robin (Dick Grayson)|Robin]], and [[Kid Flash (Wally West)|Kid Flash]] to confront their inner demons, but is defeated and captured when Kid Flash breaks out of the illusion and removes the Medusa Mask from Psycho-Pirate's face.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.dialbforblog.com/archives/193 Fanpage about the Psycho-Pirate (both Halstead and Hayden)]\n{{Timeline\n|before= \u2190 The character Solomon Grundy was debuted by Alfred Bester and Paul Reinman.

Originally known as the \"WWF Hall of Fame\", it was created in 1993, when [[Andr\u00e9 the Giant]] was posthumously inducted with a video package. The 1994 and 1995 ceremonies were held in conjunction with the annual [[King of the Ring]] pay-per-view events and the 1996 ceremony was held with the [[Survivor Series]] event. After an eight year hiatus, WWE relaunched the Hall of Fame in 2004 and has held the ceremonies in conjunction with [[WrestleMania]] ever since. Since 2005, portions of the induction ceremonies have aired on television and since 2014 the entire ceremonies have aired on the [[WWE Network]].\n\nAs of 2019, there have been 204 inductees, with 113 wrestlers inducted individually,  37 Legacy Inductees, 15 group inductions (consisting of 43 wrestlers within those groups), 10 celebrities and five Warrior Award recipients, whilst 57 members have been inducted posthumously. Four wrestlers have been inducted twice (individually and as part of a tag team/group): [[Ric Flair]], [[Shawn Michaels]], [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]], and [[Bret Hart]], with four more ([[Hulk Hogan]], [[Scott Hall]], [[Kevin Nash]], and [[Sean Waltman]]) to receive a second induction in 2020.<ref name=\"HoF\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/halloffame/|title=WWE Hall of Fame|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]|accessdate=April 24, 2007}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe WWF Hall of Fame was created in 1993.

The 1994 and 1995 ceremonies were held in conjunction with the annual [[King of the Ring]] pay-per-view events and the 1996 ceremony was held with the [[Survivor Series]] event. After an eight year hiatus, WWE relaunched the Hall of Fame in 2004 and has held the ceremonies in conjunction with [[WrestleMania]] ever since. Since 2005, portions of the induction ceremonies have aired on television and since 2014 the entire ceremonies have aired on the [[WWE Network]].\n\nAs of 2019, there have been 204 inductees, with 113 wrestlers inducted individually,  37 Legacy Inductees, 15 group inductions (consisting of 43 wrestlers within those groups), 10 celebrities and five Warrior Award recipients, whilst 57 members have been inducted posthumously. Four wrestlers have been inducted twice (individually and as part of a tag team/group): [[Ric Flair]], [[Shawn Michaels]], [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]], and [[Bret Hart]], with four more ([[Hulk Hogan]], [[Scott Hall]], [[Kevin Nash]], and [[Sean Waltman]]) to receive a second induction in 2020.<ref name=\"HoF\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/halloffame/|title=WWE Hall of Fame|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]|accessdate=April 24, 2007}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe WWF Hall of Fame was created in 1993.
