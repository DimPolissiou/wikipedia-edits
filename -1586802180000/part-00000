This ''Villa Tidenheim'' was equated with the Old Town, named \"Dietigheim\". Local historian R\u00fcdiger Kurth doubted this traditional story based on his study of written sources and local factors. During 2002 Kurth initiated [[Archaeology|archaeological]] excavations, by the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University of Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt]], managed by Professor Joachim Henning. The excavations showed that there was not any evidence of settlement between the beginning of the [[Christian Era]] and the 13th century. It seems that the historical record which mentions Wortwin (or Ortwin) von Hohenberch as Homburg's founder, as a documentary witness in Eberbach,<!--Is that the right way to translate \"in der Eberbacher Zeugenreihe\"? --> about 1180 is the first good evidence of the town's existence.\n[[File:White Tower Bad Homburg Germany.JPG|thumb|left|White Tower, viewed from Loewengasse 7.]]\n[[File:Landgrafenschloss.JPG|thumb|right|Landgraves' stately home with park and the ''Schlossturm'' (\"Wei\u00dfer Turm\" or \"White Tower\"), Bad Homburg's landmark.]]\n[[File:Bad-homburg-turm.jpg|thumb|right|''Schlossturm'' in Bad Homburg.]]\n[[File:Bad homburg golf club.jpg|thumb|right|Bad Homburg Golf Club House in the Kurpark.]]\n[[File:Bad homburg tennis club.jpg|thumb|right|Bad Homburg Tennis Club in the Kurpark.]]\n[[File:2007-09-16BadHomburgRussischeKapelle02.jpg|thumb|\"Russian Chapel\", or rather All Hallows' Church.]]\n\nAs early as 1962, in an excavation under the ''Hirschgangfl\u00fcgel'' (\"Hart-stalking-wing\") of Bad Homburg's ''Schloss'' (stately home), two burnt layers were discovered, which the man conducting the dig, G\u00fcnther Binding, accepted as evidence of two former [[castle]]s having been built on the site, one after the other, but each having burnt down later.\n\nFurther digs by the University of Frankfurt at Bad Homburg's ''Schloss'' during April 2006, once again initiated by Kurth and managed by Professor Henning, resulted in the discovery that it was actually only one burnt layer, from a [[Timber framing|half-timbered]] building\u2014- possibly a castle with towers\u2014- which from [[ceramic]] finds could be dated to the 12th or 13th century. Most likely this building had an association with Wortwin's \"castle\". Quite possibly, though, a further cultural layer from an even earlier time lies underneath these remains. Investigations using methods from natural science ([[carbon-14 dating]] and [[wikt:micromorphological|micromorphological]] analysis) will show whether the dating can be made more precise.\n\nHomberg acquired market rights about 1330, but the document granting these rights is said to have been lost.\n\nThe town's name, \"Homburg\", is from the ''Hohenberg'' Castle. The postfix \"vor der H\u00f6he\" was probably first recorded in a document of 1399. The designation ''\"Bad\"'' was not conferred until 1912.\n\nThe Hessen-Homburg noble family of [[landgrave]]s was initiated by Friedrich I of Hessen-Homburg. Friedrich II (1680\u20131708) attained fame as Prince of Homburg. During 1866, as a result of the [[Austro-Prussian War]], Homburg became [[Prussia]]n territory.\n\n===Spa town and imperial residence===\nWith the beginning of the spa industry in the town during the mid-19th century, which profited greatly from its [[casino]], the town became an internationally famous spa town. Bad Homburg was favoured particularly by Russian nobility for its baths.\n\nThe spa industry began with the discovery of the ''Elisabethenbrunnen'' (''Brunnen'' is German for \"well\") during 1834. The first spa building and the first casino in Homburg were built during 1841\u20131842 by the brothers [[Fran\u00e7ois Blanc|Fran\u00e7ois]] (1806\u20131877) and Louis Blanc (1806\u20131852), who later owned the [[Monte Carlo Casino]]. During 1860, the town was connected with [[Frankfurt]] by a railway line, the ''[[Homburg Railway|Homburger Bahn]]''.\n\nDuring 1888, Homburg became known throughout the [[German Empire]] because [[William II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm II]] declared Homburg's ''Schloss'' an Imperial summer residence, and later financed the building of the [[Church of the Redeemer, Bad Homburg|Church of the Redeemer (Erl\u00f6serkirche)]] nearby. His mother, too, lived there for several years. [[Edward VII]] of the UK was also often a guest. It was he who introduced the [[Homburg hat]] and permanent turn-up trousers. He also experienced fasting cures at Homburg 32 times.\n\nThe \"Bad Homburger Golf Club 1899 e.

It was erected during 1914.\n\n[[Horex]] was a well known German motorcycle brand of the \"Horex\u2014Fahrzeugbau AG\", founded during 1923 in Bad Homburg by Fritz Kleemann.\n\n===Jewish history===\n{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}\n[[File:Denkmal Samuel Agnon Bad Homburg.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Memorial to [[Shmuel Yosef Agnon]] in Bad Homburg]]\n\nDuring 1335, permission was given by Emperor [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis IV]] to [[Lords of Eppstein|Gottfried von Eppstein]] to settle 10 Jews in each of the localities of [[Eppstein]], Homburg, and [[Steinheim (Hanau)|Steinheim]]; it is uncertain, however, whether any Jews settled in Homburg at that time. Evidence for the existence of a permanent Jewish settlement in Homburg is found only at the beginning of the 16th century. Until 1600 it consisted of 2 or 3 families, and by 1632 these had increased to 16. The first [[Jewish cemetery]] was purchased during the 17th century. The community continued to grow so rapidly that during 1703 the landgrave [[Frederick II of Hesse]] decided on the construction of a special [[Jewish quarter (diaspora)|Judengasse]] (Jewish quarter). A synagogue, built during 1731, was replaced by a new one during 1867. The Jewish community of Homburg was originally part of the jurisdiction of the rabbinate of [[Friedberg, Hesse|Friedberg]] but began to appoint its own rabbis during the 19th century.\n\nA [[Hebrew]] printing house was located in Homburg by Seligmann ben Hirz Reis during 1710 until 1713 when he relocated to [[Offenbach am Main]]. Among other items, he published [[Jacob ibn \u1e24abib]]'s ''[[Ein Ya'akov]]'' (1712). Hebrew printing was resumed there during 1724 by Samson ben Salman Hanau but lack of capital limited his output. The press was acquired during 1736 by Aaron ben \u1e92evi Dessau whose publications included the ''[[Shulhan Arukh]] ([[Choshen Mishpat|\u1e24oshen Mishpat]])'' with commentary (1742). The press was sold during 1748 and transferred during 1749 to [[Roedelheim]]. At the beginning of the 20th century, the spa of Homburg became a meeting place of [[History of the Jews in Russia|Russian-Jewish]] intellectuals. The Jewish population numbered 604 (7.14% of the total population) during 1865, declining to 379 in 1910 (2.64%), and 300 during 1933. Of the 74 Jews who remained on 17 May 1939, 42 were deported during 1942/1943.<ref>FJW, 215; ''[[Germania Judaica]]'', vol. 2 (1968), 369; PKG</ref>\n\n===Modern age===\nWhile the spa business experienced a long-term decrease after the two world wars, the town gained importance by becoming the site for headquarters of various authorities and administrative bodies. By autumn 1946, the military government had already ordered the founding of [[Bizone|bizonal]] authorities. Bad Homburg was chosen as the seat of the financial administrative centre. On 23 July 1947, the Bizone Economic Council instituted the \"Special Money and Credit Centre\" here in preparation for currency reform. The centre was managed by [[Ludwig Erhard]]. After the Federal Republic of Germany\u2014- West Germany\u2014- was founded with its capital in [[Bonn]], the Federal Debt Administration (''Bundesschuldenverwaltung''), the Office for Security Adjustment (''Amt f\u00fcr Wertpapierbereinigung'') and the Federal Equalization Office (''Bundesausgleichsamt'') stayed in Bad Homburg.\n\nDuring the 20th century, Bad Homburg became a favourite residential area among the upper classes. On 30 November 1989, one of its members, [[Alfred Herrhausen]], the manager of the [[Deutsche Bank]], was killed and his driver was injured by a car bomb in Bad Homburg. It is alleged that this was an attack by the [[Red Army Faction]], though this has never been proven.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/herrhausen-mord-neue-theorie-ueber-die-herkunft-der-bombe-a-1005698.html|title=Herrhausen-Mord: Neue Theorie \u00fcber die Herkunft der Bombe|trans-title=Herrhausen-Murder: New Theory Regarding Origin of the Bomb|publisher=Spiegel Online|language=German|date=2014-11-29|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n{{wide image|Bad Homburg-Panorama.jpg|1500px|Panorama}}\n\n===Lord Mayors===\n*Karl Tettenborn \t\u2014 \t1892\u20131901\n*Ernst Ritter von Marx \t\u2014 \t1901\u20131905\n*Konrad Ma\u00df \t\u2014 \t1905\u20131907\n*Walter L\u00fcbke \tDVP \t1907\u20131924\n*Georg Eberlein \tDVP \t1924\u20131933\n*Richard Hardt \tNSDAP \t1933\u20131934\n*Erich Meusel \tNSDAP \t1933\u20131945\n*Georg Eberlein [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]], 1945-1948 \n*Karl Horn [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]], 1948-1962\n*Armin Klein CDU, 1962-1980, since 1979 with official designation '' Lord Mayor ''\n*Wolfgang Assmann CDU, 1980-1998\n*Reinhard Wolters CDU, 1998-2003 Lord Mayor; His election was subsequently declared invalid, Wolters was thus never officially Lord Mayor.

The reason for the adzes in the arms is not known; it is possibly dialectal [[Canting arms|canting]].

This ''Villa Tidenheim'' was equated with the Old Town, named \"Dietigheim\". Local historian R\u00fcdiger Kurth doubted this traditional story based on his study of written sources and local factors. During 2002 Kurth initiated [[Archaeology|archaeological]] excavations, by the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University of Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt]], managed by Professor Joachim Henning. The excavations showed that there was not any evidence of settlement between the beginning of the [[Christian Era]] and the 13th century. It seems that the historical record which mentions Wortwin (or Ortwin) von Hohenberch as Homburg's founder, as a documentary witness in Eberbach,<!--Is that the right way to translate \"in der Eberbacher Zeugenreihe\"? --> about 1180 is the first good evidence of the town's existence.\n[[File:White Tower Bad Homburg Germany.JPG|thumb|left|White Tower, viewed from Loewengasse 7.]]\n[[File:Landgrafenschloss.JPG|thumb|right|Landgraves' stately home with park and the ''Schlossturm'' (\"Wei\u00dfer Turm\" or \"White Tower\"), Bad Homburg's landmark.]]\n[[File:Bad-homburg-turm.jpg|thumb|right|''Schlossturm'' in Bad Homburg.]]\n[[File:Bad homburg golf club.jpg|thumb|right|Bad Homburg Golf Club House in the Kurpark.]]\n[[File:Bad homburg tennis club.jpg|thumb|right|Bad Homburg Tennis Club in the Kurpark.]]\n[[File:2007-09-16BadHomburgRussischeKapelle02.jpg|thumb|\"Russian Chapel\", or rather All Hallows' Church.]]\n\nAs early as 1962, in an excavation under the ''Hirschgangfl\u00fcgel'' (\"Hart-stalking-wing\") of Bad Homburg's ''Schloss'' (stately home), two burnt layers were discovered, which the man conducting the dig, G\u00fcnther Binding, accepted as evidence of two former [[castle]]s having been built on the site, one after the other, but each having burnt down later.\n\nFurther digs by the University of Frankfurt at Bad Homburg's ''Schloss'' during April 2006, once again initiated by Kurth and managed by Professor Henning, resulted in the discovery that it was actually only one burnt layer, from a [[Timber framing|half-timbered]] building\u2014- possibly a castle with towers\u2014- which from [[ceramic]] finds could be dated to the 12th or 13th century. Most likely this building had an association with Wortwin's \"castle\". Quite possibly, though, a further cultural layer from an even earlier time lies underneath these remains. Investigations using methods from natural science ([[carbon-14 dating]] and [[wikt:micromorphological|micromorphological]] analysis) will show whether the dating can be made more precise.\n\nHomberg acquired market rights about 1330, but the document granting these rights is said to have been lost.\n\nThe town's name, \"Homburg\", is from the ''Hohenberg'' Castle. The postfix \"vor der H\u00f6he\" was probably first recorded in a document of 1399. The designation ''\"Bad\"'' was not conferred until 1912.\n\nThe Hessen-Homburg noble family of [[landgrave]]s was initiated by Friedrich I of Hessen-Homburg. Friedrich II (1680\u20131708) attained fame as Prince of Homburg. During 1866, as a result of the [[Austro-Prussian War]], Homburg became [[Prussia]]n territory.\n\n===Spa town and imperial residence===\nWith the beginning of the spa industry in the town during the mid-19th century, which profited greatly from its [[casino]], the town became an internationally famous spa town. Bad Homburg was favoured particularly by Russian nobility for its baths.\n\nThe spa industry began with the discovery of the ''Elisabethenbrunnen'' (''Brunnen'' is German for \"well\") during 1834. The first spa building and the first casino in Homburg were built during 1841\u20131842 by the brothers [[Fran\u00e7ois Blanc|Fran\u00e7ois]] (1806\u20131877) and Louis Blanc (1806\u20131852), who later owned the [[Monte Carlo Casino]]. During 1860, the town was connected with [[Frankfurt]] by a railway line, the ''[[Homburg Railway|Homburger Bahn]]''.\n\nDuring 1888, Homburg became known throughout the [[German Empire]] because [[William II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm II]] declared Homburg's ''Schloss'' an Imperial summer residence, and later financed the building of the [[Church of the Redeemer, Bad Homburg|Church of the Redeemer (Erl\u00f6serkirche)]] nearby. His mother, too, lived there for several years. [[Edward VII]] of the UK was also often a guest. It was he who introduced the [[Homburg hat]] and permanent turn-up trousers. He also experienced fasting cures at Homburg 32 times.\n\nThe \"Bad Homburger Golf Club 1899 e. V.\" in the ''R\u00f6derweisen'' in Dornholzhausen\u2014nowadays part of Bad Homburg\u2014- is Germany's oldest [[Country club|golf club]]. It had its beginnings in the Bad Homburg Spa Park (''Kurpark''), where the old clubhouse and even playable parts of the old [[golf course]] may still be found.\n\nNot far away stands the Russian Chapel\u2014- more properly called All Hallows' Church\u2014- an [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] church the first stone of which was laid in the Russian Imperial couple's presence on 16 October 1896, although they did not attend when it was consecrated almost three years later<!---Yes, this contradicts the German article, but not the link in the German article.--->.\n\nKing [[Chulalongkorn]] of Siam (Thailand) sent a Thai garden pavilion in gratitude for a successful cure. It was erected during 1914.\n\n[[Horex]] was a well known German motorcycle brand of the \"Horex\u2014Fahrzeugbau AG\", founded during 1923 in Bad Homburg by Fritz Kleemann.\n\n===Jewish history===\n{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}\n[[File:Denkmal Samuel Agnon Bad Homburg.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Memorial to [[Shmuel Yosef Agnon]] in Bad Homburg]]\n\nDuring 1335, permission was given by Emperor [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis IV]] to [[Lords of Eppstein|Gottfried von Eppstein]] to settle 10 Jews in each of the localities of [[Eppstein]], Homburg, and [[Steinheim (Hanau)|Steinheim]]; it is uncertain, however, whether any Jews settled in Homburg at that time. Evidence for the existence of a permanent Jewish settlement in Homburg is found only at the beginning of the 16th century. Until 1600 it consisted of 2 or 3 families, and by 1632 these had increased to 16. The first [[Jewish cemetery]] was purchased during the 17th century. The community continued to grow so rapidly that during 1703 the landgrave [[Frederick II of Hesse]] decided on the construction of a special [[Jewish quarter (diaspora)|Judengasse]] (Jewish quarter). A synagogue, built during 1731, was replaced by a new one during 1867. The Jewish community of Homburg was originally part of the jurisdiction of the rabbinate of [[Friedberg, Hesse|Friedberg]] but began to appoint its own rabbis during the 19th century.\n\nA [[Hebrew]] printing house was located in Homburg by Seligmann ben Hirz Reis during 1710 until 1713 when he relocated to [[Offenbach am Main]]. Among other items, he published [[Jacob ibn \u1e24abib]]'s ''[[Ein Ya'akov]]'' (1712). Hebrew printing was resumed there during 1724 by Samson ben Salman Hanau but lack of capital limited his output. The press was acquired during 1736 by Aaron ben \u1e92evi Dessau whose publications included the ''[[Shulhan Arukh]] ([[Choshen Mishpat|\u1e24oshen Mishpat]])'' with commentary (1742). The press was sold during 1748 and transferred during 1749 to [[Roedelheim]]. At the beginning of the 20th century, the spa of Homburg became a meeting place of [[History of the Jews in Russia|Russian-Jewish]] intellectuals. The Jewish population numbered 604 (7.14% of the total population) during 1865, declining to 379 in 1910 (2.64%), and 300 during 1933. Of the 74 Jews who remained on 17 May 1939, 42 were deported during 1942/1943.<ref>FJW, 215; ''[[Germania Judaica]]'', vol. 2 (1968), 369; PKG</ref>\n\n===Modern age===\nWhile the spa business experienced a long-term decrease after the two world wars, the town gained importance by becoming the site for headquarters of various authorities and administrative bodies. By autumn 1946, the military government had already ordered the founding of [[Bizone|bizonal]] authorities. Bad Homburg was chosen as the seat of the financial administrative centre. On 23 July 1947, the Bizone Economic Council instituted the \"Special Money and Credit Centre\" here in preparation for currency reform. The centre was managed by [[Ludwig Erhard]]. After the Federal Republic of Germany\u2014- West Germany\u2014- was founded with its capital in [[Bonn]], the Federal Debt Administration (''Bundesschuldenverwaltung''), the Office for Security Adjustment (''Amt f\u00fcr Wertpapierbereinigung'') and the Federal Equalization Office (''Bundesausgleichsamt'') stayed in Bad Homburg.\n\nDuring the 20th century, Bad Homburg became a favourite residential area among the upper classes. On 30 November 1989, one of its members, [[Alfred Herrhausen]], the manager of the [[Deutsche Bank]], was killed and his driver was injured by a car bomb in Bad Homburg. It is alleged that this was an attack by the [[Red Army Faction]], though this has never been proven.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/herrhausen-mord-neue-theorie-ueber-die-herkunft-der-bombe-a-1005698.html|title=Herrhausen-Mord: Neue Theorie \u00fcber die Herkunft der Bombe|trans-title=Herrhausen-Murder: New Theory Regarding Origin of the Bomb|publisher=Spiegel Online|language=German|date=2014-11-29|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n{{wide image|Bad Homburg-Panorama.jpg|1500px|Panorama}}\n\n===Lord Mayors===\n*Karl Tettenborn \t\u2014 \t1892\u20131901\n*Ernst Ritter von Marx \t\u2014 \t1901\u20131905\n*Konrad Ma\u00df \t\u2014 \t1905\u20131907\n*Walter L\u00fcbke \tDVP \t1907\u20131924\n*Georg Eberlein \tDVP \t1924\u20131933\n*Richard Hardt \tNSDAP \t1933\u20131934\n*Erich Meusel \tNSDAP \t1933\u20131945\n*Georg Eberlein [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]], 1945-1948 \n*Karl Horn [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]], 1948-1962\n*Armin Klein CDU, 1962-1980, since 1979 with official designation '' Lord Mayor ''\n*Wolfgang Assmann CDU, 1980-1998\n*Reinhard Wolters CDU, 1998-2003 Lord Mayor; His election was subsequently declared invalid, Wolters was thus never officially Lord Mayor.

The reason for the adzes in the arms is not known; it is possibly dialectal [[Canting arms|canting]].

Curtis discovers that Hayden's boyfriend, [[Nikolas Cassadine]] ([[Tyler Christopher (actor)|Tyler Christopher]]), was actually responsible for the shooting that left Hayden comatose. Curtis is soon revealed to be the brother-in-law of Police Commissioner [[Jordan Ashford]] ([[Vinessa Antoine]]) and uncle of her son, [[TJ Ashford|TJ]] ([[Tequan Richmond]]). Jordan is not happy to see Curtis, and demands that he leave town. Curtis becomes attracted to [[Valerie Spencer]] ([[Brytni Sarpy]]), an officer in training. Jordan tries to warn Valerie away from Curtis. Curtis reveals that he had a cocaine addiction, and Jordan later states that it led to him losing his job as a DEA agent. Curtis starts dating Valerie, and starts getting to know TJ. Curtis reveals that he told his brother, Tommy, that TJ was actually Shawn's son. Curtis admits to Jordan that he regrets what he did, but overhears, and is furious with his mother for lying to him. He also talks to Curtis, who convinces TJ to give Jordan another chance. Curtis tries to convince Jordan to give him a job as an officer, saying that he's changed, but Jordan has a hard time trusting him. Curtis is hired by [[Julian Jerome]] ([[William deVry]]) to find who planted a bomb in his car, which ended up killing [[Morgan Corinthos]] ([[Bryan Craig]]). Curtis suspects [[Sonny Corinthos]] ([[Maurice Benard]]), Morgan's father and Julian's rival. When Curtis goes behind Valerie's back to get evidence, Valerie breaks up with him. However, Curtis later realizes someone else is involved. When he starts tracking down his lead, Julian abruptly fires him. Curtis is left suspicious, and continues to investigate. He later teams up with [[Jason Morgan (General Hospital)|Jason]] ([[Billy Miller (actor)|Billy Miller]]) and [[Sam McCall|Sam Morgan]] ([[Kelly Monaco]]) to find Morgan's killer. They found out that it was Julian's sister [[List of General Hospital characters (1980s)#Olivia St. John|Olivia Jerome]] ([[Tonja Walker]]) that did it and framed Sonny in covering her tracks as well as kidnapping Sonny's longtime best friend [[Robin Scorpio|Robin Scorpio-Drake]] ([[Kimberly McCullough]]); the information confirmed Curtis, Jason and Sam's story.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Jordan Ashford==\n{{Infobox soap character\n| name             = Jordan Ashford\n| series           = General Hospital\n| portrayer        = [[Vinessa Antoine]] (2014\u201318)<br> Briana Nicole Henry (2018\u2013)\n| years            = 2014\u2013\n| first            = March 17, 2014\n| last             =\n| creator          = [[Ron Carlivati]]\n| introducer       = [[Frank Valentini]]\n| books            =\n| spinoffs         =\n| crossover        =\n| classification   = [[General Hospital cast members#Main cast|Present; regular]]\n| image1           = <!-- File:FILENAME.jpg  (No linking required) -->\n| imagesize1       = <!-- Defaults to 240px -->\n| imagealt1        =\n| caption1         =\n| image2           = <!-- For alternate performer only -->\n| imagesize2       = <!-- Defaults to 240px -->\n| imagealt2        =\n| caption2         =\n| image3           = <!-- For alternate performer only -->\n| imagesize3       = <!-- Defaults to 240px -->\n| imagealt3        =\n| caption3         =\n| alias            =\n| occupation       = Commissioner of the Port Charles Police Department <Br> Formerly employed by the Corinthos Organization (while working undercover for [[Anna Devane]]) <br> Former Agent for the Federal Drug Enforcement Agency <br> Former Head of Distribution for the Jerome drug operation (while working undercover) <br> Former Gallery manager at the Jerome Agency <br> Former Drug dealer <br> Formerly employed at a dentist's office \n| residence        = [[Port Charles (fictional city)|Port Charles]], [[New York (state)|New York]]\n| family           =\n| parents          =\n| adoptiveparents  =\n| stepparents      =\n| siblings         =\n| husband           = {{Plainlist|\n* Tommy Ashford (pre\u20132011)\n* [[Curtis Ashford]] (2018\u2013)\n}}\n| civilpartner     =\n| sons             = [[TJ Ashford]]\n| adoptivechildren =\n| stepchildren     =\n| grandchildren    =\n| grandparents     =\n| aunts/uncles     =\n| nieces/nephews   =\n| cousins          =\n| relatives        = Curtis Ashford\n}}\n'''Jordan Ashford''', portrayed by [[Vinessa Antoine]], was introduced on March 17, 2014, as the estranged mother of [[TJ Ashford]] ([[Tequan Richmond]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.welovesoaps.net/2014/03/vinessa-antoine-joins-general-hospital.html |website=[[We Love Soaps]] |title= Vinessa Antoine Joins General Hospital as Jordan|publisher=|accessdate=October 24, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://michaelfairmansoaps.com/news/vinessa-antoine-debuts-on-general-hospital/2014/03|title=Vinessa Antoine Debuts On General Hospital|last=Fairman|first=Michael|work=[[Michael Fairman On-Air On-Soaps]]|date=March 14, 2014|accessdate=October 24, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180122001204/http://michaelfairmansoaps.com/news/vinessa-antoine-debuts-on-general-hospital/2014/03|archive-date=January 22, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> On August 10, 2018, it was announced that Briana Nicole Henry had been cast in the role of Jordan, following Antoine's casting in the Canadian pilot series, ''Diggstown''.<ref>{{cite news |title=Exclusive: GH Hires New Jordan! |url=https://www.soapoperadigest.com/content/exclusive-gh-hires-new-jordan/ |accessdate=August 10, 2018 |work=[[Soap Opera Digest]] |agency=Odyssey Magazine Publishing Group Inc. |publisher=[[American Media, Inc.]] |date=August 10, 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180810163309/https://www.soapoperadigest.com/content/exclusive-gh-hires-new-jordan/ |archivedate=August 10, 2018 |location=United States |url-status=live}}</ref> Antoine last aired on September 7, 2018.<ref name=GH090718>{{Cite episode |series= General Hospital |series-link= General Hospital |credits= [[Shelly Altman]] and [[Chris Van Etten]] ([[Head writer]]s); William Ludel ([[Television director|Director]]); Donny Sheldon ([[Screenwriter|Script writer]]) |network= [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] |date= September 7, 2018 |season= 56 |number=14113|language= English}}</ref> Henry made her debut on September 13, 2018.<ref>{{cite web|author=Soaps SheKnows|authorlink=Soaps.com|title=GH Jordan Recast: Briana Nicole Henry's Air Date Revealed|url=http://soaps.sheknows.com/general-hospital/comings-and-goings/2041/gh-recast-briana-nicole-henry-in-as-jordan-ashford|website=[[Soaps.com]]|publisher=[[SheKnows Media]]|accessdate=September 8, 2018|location=United States|date=September 7, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Storylines===\nJordan comes to Port Charles upon learning that TJ had found himself caught in a mob war between [[Sonny Corinthos]] ([[Maurice Benard]]) and [[Julian Jerome]] ([[William deVry]]). While TJ and his guardian, [[Shawn Butler]] ([[Sean Blakemore]]), assured Jordan that TJ was safe from Julian, Jordan still pressured her son to leave Port Charles with her. When TJ refused, Jordan decided to remain in Port Charles with her son and took a job working for the Jerome Organization at an art gallery they owned. Shawn warned Jordan to stay away from the Jeromes and when she refused, he threatened to tell TJ that the reason he had been sent to Port Charles in the first place was because she was serving a two-year prison sentence for dealing drugs. While Jordan attempted to convince Shawn that she had changed, she secretly offered to distribute drugs for Julian that he was running through town. Jordan is eventually arrested as part of a sting operation organized by the Port Charles Police Department, at which time she reveals she is working undercover with the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] to bring down the Jerome Organization. Jordan confides in Anna Devane of her DEA status and Anna agrees to work with her to reveal the identity of Julian Jerome's boss.\n\nIn 2014, it is revealed that Shawn and Jordan had an affair before TJ was born and that when Tommy found a letter about the DNA test proving that Tommy, not Shawn, was TJ's father, confirming Shawn and Jordan's affair, he became so enraged that he attacked Shawn. Tommy pulled a gun but before he could kill Shawn, Shawn killed him first.\n\nIn May 2015, Jordan confirmed that Shawn, not Tommy, is in fact TJ's father. In the middle of 2015, Jordan replaces [[List of General Hospital characters#S|Kyle Sloane]] as [[police commissioner]]. In early 2016, Jordan begins dating [[General Hospital characters (2015)#Andre Maddox|Andre Maddox]] ([[Anthony Montgomery]]).

Hayden's scheme is later exposed, but she finds out that \"Jake\" is really Jason Morgan, and blackmails [[Nikolas Cassadine]] ([[Tyler Christopher (actor)|Tyler Christopher]]) with this information. However, Nikolas has Hayden shot, leaving her in a coma; she wakes up with amnesia. Hayden moves in with Nikolas, who's keeping an eye on her. Hayden later figures out the truth, but keeps quiet, and starts a relationship with Nikolas. Jason's identity is exposed, and Hayden rubs it in Elizabeth's face when Jason leaves her for her deception. Elizabeth, in turn, promises to make Hayden pay.\n\n[[Tracy Quartermaine]] ([[Jane Elliot]]) blackmails Hayden with her real identity to take over ELQ from Nikolas. Nikolas and Hayden get married, but he discovers she is Rachel Berlin, the daughter of Raymond Berlin, an imprisoned investment banker. Nikolas demands a divorce, but Hayden blackmails him, threatening to turn Nikolas in for having her shot unless they stay married. Nikolas finds diamonds in Hayden's possession that she stole from her father, and uses them as leverage against Hayden. Hayden is furious, and decides to tell the cops the truth. Nikolas stages his death to disappear and avoid being arrested, but is later presumed dead after being killed. Elizabeth blames Hayden for Nikolas' death, saying she pushed him to go on the run.\n\nHayden's mother, [[Naomi Dreyfus]] ([[Robin Riker]]), comes to town to get the diamonds, but they are taken by Elizabeth and handed over to the police. Hayden is revealed to be the daughter of [[Jeff Webber]] ([[Richard Dean Anderson]]), Elizabeth's father, making her and Elizabeth half-sisters. Hayden ends up becoming friends with [[#Hamilton Finn|Dr. Hamilton Finn]] ([[Michael Easton]]), who is battling a rare disease. Hayden is accidentally infected from one of his experiments, and also falls ill. She and Elizabeth start making amends when Elizabeth shows concern for her. Finn is eventually able to find a cure, saving him and Hayden.\n\nFinn and Hayden start a relationship, until Hayden figures out that he's an addict. Finn eventually goes to rehab, but when he tests positive for drugs, Finn insists he's being set up, and Hayden believes him. She hires investigator [[Curtis Ashford]] ([[Donnell Turner]]), and is able to prove that Finn's tests were tampered with by Dr. [[Liesl Obrecht]] ([[Kathleen Gati]]). Obrecht is fired, and Finn is reinstated. While proving Finn's innocence, Hayden discovered that she was pregnant. After Finn returns to work, he proposes to Hayden, who accepts. Obrecht, furious about getting fired, aims to get revenge on Hayden and Finn. She contacts Hayden's ex-husband, Jared Preston Jr. ([[Matt Corboy]]), who reveals that Hayden was responsible for a hit-and-run while driving drunk, but he took the blame and went to prison, hoping to get paid. But Hayden's father was arrested, and she couldn't pay him. He demands payment, or he'll tell Finn. Hayden admits the truth to Finn, who decides to forgive her. Afraid of what Jared might do, Hayden skips town on the day of her and Finn's wedding, leaving behind her ring. Finn and Curtis look for her, and discover a note Hayden left for Finn, telling him not to try and find her and that their baby died. Hayden is shown to be lying, though, and leaves, still pregnant, under a new alias.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Warren Bauer==\n{{Infobox soap character\n| name             = Warren Bauer\n| series           = General Hospital\n| portrayer        = [[Bradley Cole]]\n| first            = March 17, 2010\n| last             = July 23, 2010\n| creator          = [[Robert Guza, Jr.]]\n| introducer       = [[Jill Farren Phelps]]\n| books            =\n| spinoffs         =\n| crossover        =\n| classification   = [[List of previous General Hospital cast members|Former; recurring]]\n| image1           = <!-- File:FILENAME.jpg  (No linking required) -->\n| imagesize1       = <!-- Defaults to 240px -->\n| imagealt1        =\n| caption1         =\n| image2           = <!-- For alternate performer only -->\n| imagesize2       = <!-- Defaults to 240px -->\n| imagealt2        =\n| caption2         =\n| image3           = <!-- For alternate performer only -->\n| imagesize3       = <!-- Defaults to 240px -->\n| imagealt3        =\n| caption3         =\n| alias            =\n| species          = <!-- For non-humans only -->\n| breed            = <!-- For non-humans only -->\n| occupation       = [[Lawyer]]\n| residence        = <!-- Or \"home\" -->\n| family           =\n| owner            = <!-- For non-humans (pets) only -->\n| parents          = <!-- Or \"father\" and \"mother\" -->\n| adoptiveparents  = <!-- Or \"adoptivefather\" and \"adoptivemother\" -->\n| stepparents      = <!-- Or \"stepfather\" and \"stepmother\" -->\n| siblings         = <!-- Or \"brothers\" and \"sisters\" -->\n| wife           = [[#Melinda Bauer|Melinda Bauer]]\n| civilpartner     =\n| sons             = [[List of General Hospital characters (2000s)#Kiefer Bauer|Kiefer Bauer]]\n| daughters = Kendra Lennon\n| adoptivechildren = <!-- Or \"adoptivesons\" and \"adoptivedaughters\" -->\n| stepchildren     = <!-- Or \"stepsons\" and \"stepdaughters\" -->\n| grandchildren    = <!-- Or \"grandsons\" and \"granddaughters\" -->\n| grandparents     = <!-- Or \"grandfathers\" and \"grandmothers\" -->\n| aunts/uncles     = <!-- Or \"uncles\" and \"aunts\" -->\n| nieces/nephews   = <!-- Or \"nephews\" and \"nieces\" -->\n| cousins          = <!-- First cousins only -->\n| relatives        = <!-- For any other relative not listed above who is essential to the understanding of the character -->\n}}\n'''Warren Bauer''', portrayed by [[Bradley Cole]], was introduced as the father of [[Kiefer Bauer]] ([[Christian Alexander]]) on March 17, 2010.\n\n===Casting===\nThe cast was announced on February 9, 2010 by Cole himself on ''[[Twitter]]''.

However, Warren refuses to blame his son and blames the enemies of Kristina's mob boss father, [[Sonny Corinthos]] ([[Maurice Benard]]) for the attack. Due to the ongoing investigation, Warren reminds Kiefer that he never approved of his relationship with Kristina. When Kiefer is killed in a hit and run accident, Warren believes Kristina's mother, [[Alexis Davis|Alexis]] ([[Nancy Lee Grahn]]) killed his son on purpose, and vows revenge. Warren and wife [[#Melinda Bauer|Melinda]] ([[Lisa Waltz]]) post an online memorial page portraying Kiefer as a great student and great person and openly accuse Alexis of killing their son. He also accuses [[Ethan Lovett]] ([[Nathan Parsons]]) of being Kristina's \"real\" attacker. Warren tries to guilt Kristina into falsely accusing Ethan once again by reminding her of Kiefer's love. Warren continues pressuring the police to press charges and continues attacking Kristina and Alexis in public. When Alexis is acquitted, Warren files a wrongful death suit. Warren even pressures federal prosecutor, [[#Claire Walsh|Claire Walsh]] ([[Dahlia Salem]]) to press charges against Alexis. When Warren gets too aggressive with Alexis and her daughters in public, Sonny openly accuses Warren of abusing his son. In late July, Warren attempts but fails to obtain Kristina's medical records at General Hospital and threatens to sue for obstruction of justice. Warren runs into Kristina and nearly hits her when she berates him for abusing Kiefer, forcing her brother, [[Michael Corinthos|Michael]] ([[Chad Duell]]), to step in. A fight ensues with Lucky pulling Michael off Warren. When police commissioner [[Mac Scorpio]] ([[John J. York]]) arrives, Warren snaps and pulls a gun, shooting Mac and Ethan.

In July 2016, Claudette comes to town, inquiring about a job at ''Crimson Magazine'', Maxie's workplace. She hides the fact that she knows Maxie is engaged to Nathan. Later, she lures Nathan to her hotel room, hoping to talk to him. Maxie, at the same time, finds out who Claudette is, and the two leave. Though Claudette says she's not after Nathan, Maxie is suspicious of her. Claudette reunites with [[Griffin Munro]] ([[Matt Cohen (actor)|Matt Cohen]]), the man with whom she cheated on Nathan. Griffin is not happy, though, and says he's ashamed of their affair. Claudette says that she still loves him and hopes they'll be together. Claudette confesses to Nathan that she came to Port Charles looking for him because she wants his help to protect her and her daughter from her ex-lover, [[Valentin Cassadine]] ([[James Patrick Stuart]]). She and her daughter, [[Charlotte Cassadine|Charlotte]], lived with Valentin, until he became dangerous and threatened her. She took Charlotte and went on the run. Claudette claims Charlotte is Nathan's daughter, but when a DNA test disproves it, she says Griffin is the father. After bringing Charlotte to town, Claudette finds her room ransacked, and realizes Valentin has found her. She skips town, leaving Charlotte behind with Griffin. On the plane, though, she's cornered by Valentin. Nathan finds out he and Claudette are not divorced, and he & Maxie try to track her down so they can get married.

Easton had portrayed the character of McBain on ''General Hospital'' for little less than a year before it was announced that the efforts to bring ''One Life to Live'' online had begun again, and thus they were recalling the character of John McBain (as well as two other former ''One Life to Live'' characters) back to the parent series. As Easton was still under contract with ABC at this time, the decision was made to reintroduce the actors to ''General Hospital'' as brand new characters. Prior to his role on ''One Life to Live'', Easton had portrayed the role of vampire [[Caleb Morley]] on the defunct ''General Hospital'' spinoff, ''[[Port Charles]]'', from May 2001 to October 2003. In early 2013, Easton's portrayal of Morley was revisited on ''General Hospital'', with the series retconning the entire Morley identity as an alter ego of psychotic serial killer [[#Stephen Clay|Stephen Clay]]. In Easton's new role as Dr. Silas Clay, he serves as Stephen's older brother, as well as the paternal uncle of Stephen's son, [[Rafe Kovich, Jr.]], with any and all references to John McBain in the ''General Hospital'' canon eliminated. On July 29, 2015, it was confirmed that Easton would depart ''General Hospital'' in the role of Silas.<ref name=\"Silas\">{{cite web|last1=Giddens |first1=Jamey |title=Confirmed: Michael Easton Out at ''General Hospital''!

Sam takes Danny to the hospital, where he's diagnosed with cancer. Silas chooses to stay in town and help with Danny's care, giving up his petition for custody of Rafe. During Danny's treatment, he and Sam grow closer.\n\nSilas later encounters [[Ava Jerome]] ([[Maura West]]), his old flame, and her daughter, [[Kiki Jerome|Kiki]] ([[Kristen Alderson]]). Though Ava denies it initially, Silas later finds out that Kiki is his daughter. He and Kiki start to bond, and Silas starts dating Sam. When Detective [[Nathan West (General Hospital)|Nathan West]] ([[Ryan Paevey]]) starts questioning Silas about a cold case, Sam finds out that Silas is married. Silas admits it, and reveals that his wife, [[Nina Reeves|Nina]], has been in a coma for 20 years. He blames himself, because he was having an affair with Ava, and believes she attempted suicide when she found out. However, he finds out Nathan suspects Silas tried to kill her. Sam helps prove his innocence by revealing that Nina's mother, [[Madeline Reeves]] ([[Donna Mills]]), was the one responsible. Nina ([[Michelle Stafford]]) returns soon after, waking up from her coma. She moves in with Silas, who takes care of her, but still dates Sam. Though Nina insists she's fine with Silas moving on, Sam is suspicious.\n\nWhen Rafe dies in a car accident, Silas is devastated, and accuses [[Patrick Drake]] ([[Jason Thompson (actor)|Jason Thompson]]), Rafe's doctor, of intentionally killing him since Rafe caused an accident that killed Patrick's [[Children of General Hospital#Gabriel Santiago|son]]. Sam, though, defends Patrick, and she and Silas break up. Silas realizes that Patrick did not kill Rafe, but also finds out Nina intentionally sabotaged his relationship with Sam as revenge for him sleeping with Ava.\n\nHaving lost Sam for good, Silas helps out Kiki and Ava, who is in hiding after committing murder. When Nina steals Ava's newborn daughter, [[Avery Corinthos|Avery]], Silas helps Kiki bring Avery home. Ava is sent to prison, and Silas helps Kiki take care of Avery. When Ava escapes from prison, she is presumed dead after being shot. However, Silas saves her, and hides her in a facility, where he reveals she's dying of cancer. Though Ava is ready to die, Silas saves her by kidnapping Avery, and taking her bone marrow to save Ava's life. Ava returns to Port Charles under an alias, hoping to get close to Avery. Though Silas knows the truth, she blackmails him with Avery's kidnapping to stay silent. Soon after, Silas is found dead. His killer is revealed to be Madeline, who killed Silas to get her hands on Nina's inheritance.<ref name=\"Silas\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.movienewsguide.com/general-hospital-murder-mystery-month-kiki-jerome-dr-silas-clay-killer/81237|accessdate=March 13, 2016|date=August 6, 2015|title='General Hospital' Murder Mystery to Last Only a Month; Kiki Jerome Dr. Silas Clay Killer|work=Movie News Guide|location=United States|first=Martin|last=Suan|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313121840/http://www.movienewsguide.com/general-hospital-murder-mystery-month-kiki-jerome-dr-silas-clay-killer/81237|archive-date=March 13, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Fairman|first1=Michael|title=General Hospital: Silas Is Murdered!

The character is an adaptation of the fictional vampire character [[Caleb Morley]], originated by Easton on the ''General Hospital'' spin-off ''Port Charles'' from 2001\u20132003.  When Caleb was killed at the end of \"Tempted,\" he eventually returned during the story arc \"Naked Eyes,\" this time in the guise of the vampire rock star \"Stephen Clay.\" Caleb Morley aka Stephen Clay remained a fan favorite and primary character until the cancellation of ''Port Charles'' in October 2003. Easton joined the cast of ''One Life to Live'', where he played the role of John McBain until its cancellation in January 2012 and then brought the character of McBain to ''General Hospital''. In 2013, writers decided to revisit Caleb's storyline from ''Port Charles'' and adapt it into the ''General Hospital'' storylines.\n\n===Storylines===\n[[File:MichaelEastonCrop.jpg|thumbnail|100px|left|Michael Easton plays Stephen.]]\nIn January 2013, [[Lucy Coe]], having recently returned to Port Charles after a ten-year absence, has a run-in with Detective John McBain. Lucy claims McBain is a vampire named Caleb Morley, and attempts to stake him in the chest. She is arrested and eventually sent to Ferncliff [[sanatorium]]. In the wake of her hospitalization, her estranged husband [[Kevin Collins (General Hospital)|Kevin Collins]] returns, stating Lucy's claims of Caleb's existence are merely a psychotic delusion. Meanwhile, Alison Barrington returns to Port Charles, with her teenage son, Rafe Kovich, Jr. Alison also mistakes McBain for Caleb, prompting her to flee. Alison is confronted by Caleb, who kills her. McBain arrives and finds a visibly shaken Rafe holding the murder weapon. Rafe is detained as the primary suspect, and when questioned by Police Commissioner [[Anna Devane]], claims McBain murdered his mother. Meanwhile, Lucy, having learned of Alison's murder, stages a breakout from Ferncliff, with the assistance of [[Heather Webber (General Hospital)|Heather Webber]] and [[Todd Manning]], determined to protect Rafe.\n\nMeanwhile, Caleb poses as McBain and removes Rafe from police custody. He kills a police officer and tries to take Rafe out of Port Charles, but Rafe runs away. He visits a professor at Port Charles University and kills him when he reveals he knows about Caleb. While he's there, [[Sam Morgan (General Hospital)|Sam Morgan]] comes to PCU looking for the professor. Caleb becomes fixated on her, believing she's [[Livvie Locke]], his former wife. Caleb goes to the pier, where Heather is with Sam's son, [[Daniel Morgan (General Hospital)|Danny]]. Caleb chokes Heather and throws her into the water. He tries to take Danny but Todd stops him. After the police leave, he finds Sam and Danny on the pier and kidnaps them. Meanwhile, John, Lucy, and Rafe break out of police custody to try to save Sam and Danny. John heads to PCU, and finds out \"Caleb\" is actually Stephen Clay, a former rock musician who went insane after the death of his wife, Livvie. Clay played the persona of a vampire onstage and, after his wife died, he believed he was an actual vampire and went on a killing spree before being arrested and thrown into a mental institution he escaped from. Meanwhile, \"Caleb\" takes Sam and Danny to Wyndemere, telling Sam they'll be reunited once he bites her three times. John, Lucy, and Rafe arrive to find Danny alone. \"Caleb\" ties Sam up in the tunnels but eventually John and Lucy arrive and kill him. Later, Lucy views Stephen's body at the morgue she notices the ring is missing, when Anna gets Lucy out of the morgue. It is revealed the morgue attendant had the ring and when he tries it on, the young attendant is seen lying dead as the figure walks off meaning there really wasn't a Stephen Clay, but Caleb Morley, the vampire, again using his former alias.\n{{clear right}}\n\n==Brad Cooper==\n{{Infobox soap character\n| name             = Brad Cooper\n| series           = General Hospital\n| portrayer        = {{Plainlist |\n* Unknown actor (2013)\n* [[Parry Shen]] (2013\u2013)\n}}\n| years            = 2013\u2013\n| first            = February 13, 2013\n| last             =\n| creator          = [[Ron Carlivati]]\n| introducer       = [[Frank Valentini]]\n| books            =\n| spinoffs         =\n| crossover        =\n| classification   = [[List of General Hospital cast members#Recurring cast|Present; recurring]]\n| image1           = <!-- File:FILENAME.jpg  (No linking required) -->\n| imagesize1       = <!-- Defaults to 240px -->\n| imagealt1        =\n| caption1         =\n| image2           = <!-- For alternate performer only -->\n| imagesize2       = <!-- Defaults to 240px -->\n| imagealt2        =\n| caption2         =\n| image3           = <!-- For alternate performer only -->\n| imagesize3       = <!-- Defaults to 240px -->\n| imagealt3        =\n| caption3         =\n| alias            =\n| occupation       = Lab technician \n| residence        = [[Port Charles (fictional city)|Port Charles]], [[New York (state)|New York]]\n| family           =\n| father           = [[List of General Hospital characters#S|Kim Soong Wu]]\n| adoptiveparents  = \n| stepparents      = \n| siblings         = \n| spouse = {{Plainlist |\n* Rosalie Martinez (divorced)\n* [[Lucas Jones]] (2016\u2013)\n}}\n| civilpartner     =\n| adoptivesons = {{Plainlist|\n* Wylie Cooper-Jones \n* [[Children of General Hospital#Jonah Corinthos|Jonah Corinthos]] (illegal)<ref name=GH072618>{{Cite episode |series= General Hospital |series-link= General Hospital |credits= [[Shelly Altman]] and [[Chris Van Etten]] ([[Head writer]]s); [[Scott McKinsey]] ([[Television director|Director]]); Suzanne Flynn ([[Screenwriter|Script writer]]) |network= [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] |date= July 26, 2018 |season= 56 |number=14087|language= English}}</ref><ref name=GH073018>{{Cite episode |series= General Hospital |series-link= General Hospital |credits= [[Shelly Altman]] and [[Chris Van Etten]] ([[Head writer]]s); Denise Van Cleve ([[Television director|Director]]); Kate Hall ([[Screenwriter|Script writer]]) |network= [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] |date= July 30, 2018 |season= 56 |number=14089|language= English}}</ref><ref name=GH073118>{{Cite episode |series= General Hospital |series-link= General Hospital |credits= [[Shelly Altman]] and [[Chris Van Etten]] ([[Head writer]]s); William Ludel ([[Television director|Director]]); [[Elizabeth Korte]] ([[Screenwriter|Script writer]]) |network= [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] |date= July 31, 2018 |season= 56 |number=14090|language= English}}</ref><ref name=GH080218>{{Cite episode |series= General Hospital |series-link= General Hospital |credits= [[Shelly Altman]] and [[Chris Van Etten]] ([[Head writer]]s); William Ludel ([[Television director|Director]]); Charlotte Gibson ([[Screenwriter|Script writer]]) |network= [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] |date= August 2, 2018 |season= 56 |number=14092|language= English}}</ref>\n}}\n| adoptivechildren = \n| stepchildren     = \n| grandchildren    = \n| grandparents     = \n| aunts            = [[List of General Hospital characters#S|Jade Soong]]\n| nieces/nephews   = \n| cousins          = \n| relatives        = [[List of General Hospital characters#W|Mr. Wu]]\n}}\n'''Bradley \"Brad\" Cooper''' was introduced to the series on February 13, 2013, played by an unknown actor.

Trey is the producer of Kristina's reality television show ''Mob Princess'', and manipulates her into continuing the show despite her family's disapproval. Trey immediately clashes with Kristina's parents, [[Alexis Davis]] and mob boss Sonny Corinthos. He convinces Sonny to agree to the reality show while keeping his mysterious boss up-to-date on the project. Trey moves into his new apartment and clashes with his roommate, [[Starr Manning]]. Meanwhile, Kristina's brother, [[Michael Corinthos|Michael]] accuses Trey of manipulating and using both Kristina and Starr, though he denies it. Trey continues to make enemies when it comes to Starr's father, [[Todd Manning|Todd]], while he is oblivious to the fact that Kristina has a crush on him. Meanwhile, Trey bashes Sonny's girlfriend [[Kate Howard]] when it is revealed that her alternate personality caused the car accident killing Starr's family. Meanwhile, Kristina reveals her true feelings for Trey and they share their first kiss in July 2012; however, Trey is hesitant about getting involved with her fearing it will interfere with the show. It is soon revealed that Trey is actually the son of Sonny's longtime nemesis [[#Joe Scully, Jr.|Joe Scully Jr]], who is financing the show. Kristina continues her flirtatious behavior while Trey becomes determined to catch Sonny doing something illegal on camera. Trey is shocked to find his father in prison in [[Atlantic City]]. Joe admits that his father Joe Sr. was a mobster that Sonny used to work for, and convinces Trey to keep his true identity a secret so they can get revenge on Sonny for framing him for murder. He also coerces Trey into ending the reality show and romancing Kristina. In late August, Joe coerces Trey into eloping with Kristina [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]. Trey leads Kristina to believe that they have to get married for the show so he won't be sued. In September 2012, Trey has a confrontation with Kate, who recognizes a medal that he was wearing as being identical to one that Joe wore the night he raped her, leading her to realize that Trey is the son she conceived as the result of the rape. This revelation prompts Kate's alter, Connie, to emerge, and she proceeds to tell Trey that she wished he had never been born. In October 2012, Joe abducts Kristina on orders from [[Cesar Faison]], who intends to have Joe kill her in an convoluted effort to gain control of Sonny's assets. Trey attempts to wrestle the gun away from Joe, but inadvertently ends up shooting him the shoulder, resulting in Joe fleeing the scene before he can fulfill Faison's orders. Subsequently, Trey's connection to Joe is revealed, prompting Kristina to end her marriage to him, and Trey is evicted from the apartment he shared with [[Starr Manning]] by its original owner, [[Maxie Jones]]. Trey spends the next few months living at the local church, all the while attempting to aid Sonny in his quest to have Connie committed to Shadybrook Sanitarium, which ultimately fails. As time goes on, Trey and Kristina reconcile, and plan to relocate to California. However, their plans are derailed when, on New Year's Eve, they are involved in a car accident, which causes an aneurysm in Trey's brain to rupture, rendering him brain dead on January 8, 2013.

When the two teenagers began dating, Josslyn's mother, Carly Corinthos ([[Laura Wright]]) became eager to meet Kim, which Oscar kept delaying due to Kim's long working hours. However, when Carly invited Kim to Thanksgiving dinner, she eagerly accepted the invitation. At the dinner, Kim met [[Jason Morgan (General Hospital)|Jason Morgan]] ([[Steve Burton (actor)|Steve Burton]]), who she recognized as Andrew Cain. Carly explained that Jason was Drew's twin brother, and that the two had been separated at birth. With Carly eager to know what Kim knew about Drew, who had been rendered amnesiac and had required facial reconstruction surgery due to injuries sustained in an auto accident, Kim explained she had casually dated Drew for a short time in San Diego. After Drew, who was a Navy SEAL, was redeployed, Kim discovered she was pregnant with Oscar and attempted to contact him, but was told that he deserted and eventually stopped looking for him. Years later, Kim had attempted to run Oscar's DNA through an ancestry site in order to locate Drew or any of his family due to Oscar's curiosity about his father. It was at this point that Kim learned that Oscar had family living in Port Charles, so she and Oscar relocated in order to find Drew and his family. Shocked to discover that Oscar was Quartermaine following her move from Mercy Hospital to General Hospital, Kim was greeted warmly by chief of staff [[Monica Quartermaine|Dr. Monica Quartermaine]] ([[Leslie Charleson]]), Oscar's grandmother. Despite having no memory of his relationship with Kim, Drew ([[Billy Miller (actor)|Billy Miller]]) was eager to build a relationship with Oscar. In an effort to spark some memory of his past, Kim gave Drew a CD of music that he had made for her before he left San Diego, for which he was grateful. With no indication that Drew recalled their past or harbored any romantic feelings towards her, Kim focused on her role at General Hospital and struck up a friendship with [[Julian Jerome]] ([[William deVry]]), which later turned into a romantic relationship. In September 2018, Oscar was revealed to be dying of an inoperable Grade IV Glioblastoma, which had Kim had been aware of for two years without telling him. Oscar was furious with his mother for lying to him and began to drift toward a cult led by Hank \"Shiloh\" Archer (Coby Ryan McLaughlin), but never became substantially involved with them. On New Years, Kim kissed Drew, and in his anger Julian ended his relationship with her, even going so far to lie about sleeping with someone else. After some time, Kim and Julian were able to reconcile their relationship. In March 2019, Dr. Terry Randolph (Cassandra James) informed Kim, Drew and Oscar that the Glioblastoma had advanced, and Oscar had only six months to live. On April 29, 2019, three and half weeks after experiencing a severe seizure, Oscar died surrounded by Josslyn, Kim and Drew at the Quartermaine Mansion. Oscar was cremated and honoring his wishes, a devastated Kim and Drew climbed to the summit of Kilimanjaro and scattered his ashes there. In her grief, Kim began to spiral out of control, becoming obsessed with having another baby. After failing to convince Julian to conceive a child with her, she drugged and attempted to rape Drew at the wedding reception for [[Franco Baldwin]] ([[Roger Howarth]]) and [[Elizabeth Webber]] ([[Rebecca Herbst]]) as an alternative. Julian, recognizing that Kim was losing control, was able to stop her and after waking up and realizing what had happened, Drew opted not to press charges against her. In August 2019, a flash drive containing Drew's memories prior to arriving in Port Charles was stolen by Shiloh, who had kidnapped [[Cameron Webber]] ([[William Lipton]]) and attempted to implant them into his brain. Having been discovered by Franco, he opted to take Cameron's place in the experiment, and once he woke up, firmly believed himself to be Drew Cain. After running into Kim at General Hospital, Franco began relaying memories of Drew's past with Kim to her as if he himself had lived them. Distressed and demanding answers as to what was going, Elizabeth and the real Drew explained everything to her. Shortly thereafter, Drew left Port Charles in an effort to locate Dr. Andre Maddox ([[Anthony Montgomery]]), who he believed stood the best chance of restoring Franco to his former self. When Drew was declared dead after his plane has crashed, Kim began to fall in love with Franco and became convinced that she had a second shot at the relationship she had missed out on years earlier with Drew. Desperate for a future with \"Drew\" free of his ties to all of Franco's loved ones, Kim sought help from attorney Martin Gray ([[Michael E. Knight]]) in an effort to grant Franco the right to live his life as Drew Cain. As their relationship deepened, the two made plans to leave Port Charles and begin their life together. Following a conversation with [[Scott Baldwin]] ([[Kin Shriner]]), who explained to \"Drew\" that Franco had protected him from sexual predator Jim Harvey as a child, \"Drew\" informed Kim that he couldn't leave with her, and that he owed it to Franco to try to give him his life back, effectively ending their relationship.

He believes that Nina overdosed when she found out about his affair with [[Ava Jerome]], and has been in a coma for 20 years. However, Nina's brother, Detective [[Nathan West (General Hospital)|Nathan West]], believes Silas tried to kill her, and investigates the case. He finds out that it was actually Nina's mother [[Madeline Reeves]], who tried to kill Nina, because Nina was pregnant with Silas' child. She wanted to get rid of Nina's baby, and accidentally put her own daughter in a coma. Madeline tells Nathan that Nina has died, but later says that she only had Nina declared dead to get the inheritance that was left to Nina by Madeline's late husband.\n\nNina first appears onscreen in May 2014, waking up from her coma. Roughly a month later, Nina arrives in Port Charles, and shocks a bewildered Silas with her presence. Both Silas and Nathan are happy that she's alive, but Nina soon has to find out that much has changed. She is introduced to [[Kiki Jerome]], Silas' daughter with Ava. Silas is also now dating [[Sam McCall|Sam Morgan]], despite Nina still showing an interest in him. After first not being aware that Silas and Sam are a couple, Nina claims to be fine with it; accepting the end of her marriage; and tells Silas that it would only be natural for his life to go on. However it is later revealed that Nina has been awake for longer than she says and that she trashed Silas' apartment a few months back. Nina in fact wants revenge on everyone that wronged her. Nina married [[Ric Lansing]] on May 18, 2015.\n\nIn November 2015, Nina goes to [[Julian Jerome]], who owns ''Crimson'' magazine under his media empire, for a job. She ends up getting the job of [[editor-in-chief]] since the former had left the magazine. She works closely with [[Maxie Jones]]. When Nina and Maxie need someone to take pictures for the Nutcracker Gala, Maxie has an idea that [[Dillon Quartermaine]] (Robert Palmer Watkins) should stay in town, work for Nina, and take pictures of everyone at the Gala.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://michaelfairmansoaps.com/news/general-hospital-previews-their-nutcracker-gala-with-first-look-photos/2015/12/06/|accessdate=December 29, 2015|date=December 6, 2015|work=Michael Fairman On-Air On-Soaps|last1=Fairman|first1=Michael|title=General Hospital Previews Their Nutcracker Gala With First Look Photos!}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ghdailydish.blogspot.com/2015/12/the-nutcracker-gala.html|accessdate=December 29, 2015|date=December 21, 2015|work=GH Daily Blog|title=The Nutcracker Gala}}</ref> In October 2018, a DNA test is arranged by Valentin (James Patrick Stuart) and confirms that Sasha Gilmore is Nina's daughter; however, it is later revealed that Valentin hired her to pretend to be her daughter.

Though she rejects him, Carlos plants seeds of doubt in her about Patrick's devotion because he is still wearing his wedding ring. Carlos is eventually revealed to be the mob enforcer for [[Julian Jerome]]. Days before Patrick and Sabrina's wedding, Carlos sees Robin Scorpio, Patrick's presumed dead wife and Sonny's presumed dead friend alive. He tells Sabrina, but she refuses to believe him. Carlos is later kidnapped by rival mob boss Sonny Corinthos, and lies about claiming to be the brother of Sonny's late [[Lily Corinthos|Lily]] (Lilly Melgar) hoping it will keep him alive. However, it is revealed that Carlos is lying, but before Sonny's henchman, [[Shawn Butler]] can kill him, Carlos escapes with help from [[TJ Ashford]]. Carlos is shot during a shootout, and makes his way to Sabrina's. When Sabrina learns she is pregnant, Carlos claims to be the father despite knowing the child is Patrick's. Sabrina tells the truth to Patrick about him being the child's father and not Carlos. Carlos is then arrested for the murder of [[AJ Quartermaine]]. [[Ava Jerome]] visits him and threatens him if he babbles the truth about AJ then she will hurt Sabrina. So for Sabrina's sake, he pleads guilty. When Sabrina visits him in jail, he lies to her that he killed AJ and that he was lying to her all this time. Unable to bear the pain, Sabrina leaves. Months later, Sabrina visits Carlos in jail to fill him in on how she found out the truth, indicating that she is no longer upset with him. In May 2015, Carlos kills [[Duke Lavery]] by delivering a fatal gunshot wound to his abdomen. In retaliation, Carlos is killed by Anna Devane on the docks of the Port Charles Harbor. In late November 2015, Carlos shows up at Sabrina's door. Apparently, Rivera had not died. He sees that Sabrina is pregnant and thinks the baby is his. At first she denies it, but when he overhears a private conversation between Felix and her, he realizes that the baby is his and not the child of [[Michael Corinthos]], Sabrina's boyfriend. Sabrina still wants to keep the secret, feeling Carlos is dangerous to be around. However, when Michael finds out the truth, he leaves Sabrina, and she decides to go on the run with Carlos. Their son is born while they are fugitives, and they run with the help of [[Paul Hornsby]]. Carlos is found by Sonny and Anna in Colombia, and they bring him back to Port Charles to stand trial for murdering Duke. However, Carlos threatens Paul to help him escape. Carlos manages to escape from the prisoner transport van, and calls Julian for help to find a way out of town. Julian, though, stabs Carlos and throws him into the harbor. He's found by Michael, who brings him to the hospital, where Carlos succumbs to his injuries.\n{{clear right}}\n\n==Aaron Roland==\n{{Infobox soap character\n| name           = Aaron Roland\n| series         = General Hospital\n| portrayer      = [[John DeLuca]]\n| creator        = [[Shelly Altman]] and [[Jean Passanante]]\n| years     = 2016\n| first          = April 27, 2016\n| last = August 11, 2016\n| classification = [[List of previous General Hospital cast members|Former; recurring]]\n| occupation     = Manager of ''Perks Coffee'' (2016\u2013)\n}}\n'''Aaron Roland''', played by [[John DeLuca]], was introduced in April 2016 and departed in August 2016.

Sonny and Brenda confront Suzanne about her schemes and she claims she is worried Sonny's enemies will target Brenda. It is then revealed that Suzanne is actually married to the Balkan, aka Theo Hoffman. The duo want Brenda to answer for their son, Aleksander's death in 2007. After Theo kidnaps Brenda with the help of [[Shawn Butler]] ([[Sean Blakemore]]), it is revealed that Brenda gave birth to Aleksander's stillborn son with Suzanne by her side. Theo immediately assumes the child lived as it was Suzanne who witnessed the birth. Though denying Theo's accusations, she harbors resentment toward her husband for allowing their son into the criminal life. During Theo's search for their grandson, Suzanne kills him. Suzanne continues to raise her grandson in secret, but to keep Brenda and Sonny from finding him, she presents Brenda with another little boy named Lucian, and pretends he is the child. When Sonny demands a DNA test, Suzanne kidnaps the boy and skips town. Fortunately, Suzanne is found in [[San Antonio]] with Brenda's biological son, Alec.

Curtis is soon revealed to be the brother-in-law of Police Commissioner [[Jordan Ashford]] ([[Vinessa Antoine]]) and uncle of her son, [[TJ Ashford|TJ]] ([[Tequan Richmond]]). Jordan is not happy to see Curtis, and demands that he leave town. Curtis becomes attracted to [[Valerie Spencer]] ([[Brytni Sarpy]]), an officer in training. Jordan tries to warn Valerie away from Curtis. Curtis reveals that he had a cocaine addiction, and Jordan later states that it led to him losing his job as a DEA agent. Curtis starts dating Valerie, and starts getting to know TJ. Curtis reveals that he told his brother, Tommy, that TJ was actually Shawn's son. Curtis admits to Jordan that he regrets what he did, but overhears, and is furious with his mother for lying to him. He also talks to Curtis, who convinces TJ to give Jordan another chance. Curtis tries to convince Jordan to give him a job as an officer, saying that he's changed, but Jordan has a hard time trusting him. Curtis is hired by [[Julian Jerome]] ([[William deVry]]) to find who planted a bomb in his car, which ended up killing [[Morgan Corinthos]] ([[Bryan Craig]]). Curtis suspects [[Sonny Corinthos]] ([[Maurice Benard]]), Morgan's father and Julian's rival. When Curtis goes behind Valerie's back to get evidence, Valerie breaks up with him. However, Curtis later realizes someone else is involved. When he starts tracking down his lead, Julian abruptly fires him. Curtis is left suspicious, and continues to investigate.

When TJ refused, Jordan decided to remain in Port Charles with her son and took a job working for the Jerome Organization at an art gallery they owned. Shawn warned Jordan to stay away from the Jeromes and when she refused, he threatened to tell TJ that the reason he had been sent to Port Charles in the first place was because she was serving a two-year prison sentence for dealing drugs. While Jordan attempted to convince Shawn that she had changed, she secretly offered to distribute drugs for Julian that he was running through town. Jordan is eventually arrested as part of a sting operation organized by the Port Charles Police Department, at which time she reveals she is working undercover with the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] to bring down the Jerome Organization.

Hayden is accidentally infected from one of his experiments, and also falls ill. She and Elizabeth start making amends when Elizabeth shows concern for her. Finn is eventually able to find a cure, saving him and Hayden.\n\nFinn and Hayden start a relationship, until Hayden figures out that he's an addict. Finn eventually goes to rehab, but when he tests positive for drugs, Finn insists he's being set up, and Hayden believes him. She hires investigator [[Curtis Ashford]] ([[Donnell Turner]]), and is able to prove that Finn's tests were tampered with by Dr. [[Liesl Obrecht]] ([[Kathleen Gati]]). Obrecht is fired, and Finn is reinstated. While proving Finn's innocence, Hayden discovered that she was pregnant. After Finn returns to work, he proposes to Hayden, who accepts. Obrecht, furious about getting fired, aims to get revenge on Hayden and Finn. She contacts Hayden's ex-husband, Jared Preston Jr. ([[Matt Corboy]]), who reveals that Hayden was responsible for a hit-and-run while driving drunk, but he took the blame and went to prison, hoping to get paid. But Hayden's father was arrested, and she couldn't pay him. He demands payment, or he'll tell Finn. Hayden admits the truth to Finn, who decides to forgive her. Afraid of what Jared might do, Hayden skips town on the day of her and Finn's wedding, leaving behind her ring. Finn and Curtis look for her, and discover a note Hayden left for Finn, telling him not to try and find her and that their baby died. Hayden is shown to be lying, though, and leaves, still pregnant, under a new alias.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Warren Bauer==\n{{Infobox soap character\n| name             = Warren Bauer\n| series           = General Hospital\n| portrayer        = [[Bradley Cole]]\n| first            = March 17, 2010\n| last             = July 23, 2010\n| creator          = [[Robert Guza, Jr.]]\n| introducer       = [[Jill Farren Phelps]]\n| books            =\n| spinoffs         =\n| crossover        =\n| classification   = [[List of previous General Hospital cast members|Former; recurring]]\n| image1           = <!-- File:FILENAME.jpg  (No linking required) -->\n| imagesize1       = <!-- Defaults to 240px -->\n| imagealt1        =\n| caption1         =\n| image2           = <!-- For alternate performer only -->\n| imagesize2       = <!-- Defaults to 240px -->\n| imagealt2        =\n| caption2         =\n| image3           = <!-- For alternate performer only -->\n| imagesize3       = <!-- Defaults to 240px -->\n| imagealt3        =\n| caption3         =\n| alias            =\n| species          = <!-- For non-humans only -->\n| breed            = <!-- For non-humans only -->\n| occupation       = [[Lawyer]]\n| residence        = <!-- Or \"home\" -->\n| family           =\n| owner            = <!-- For non-humans (pets) only -->\n| parents          = <!-- Or \"father\" and \"mother\" -->\n| adoptiveparents  = <!-- Or \"adoptivefather\" and \"adoptivemother\" -->\n| stepparents      = <!-- Or \"stepfather\" and \"stepmother\" -->\n| siblings         = <!-- Or \"brothers\" and \"sisters\" -->\n| wife           = [[#Melinda Bauer|Melinda Bauer]]\n| civilpartner     =\n| sons             = [[List of General Hospital characters (2000s)#Kiefer Bauer|Kiefer Bauer]]\n| daughters = Kendra Lennon\n| adoptivechildren = <!-- Or \"adoptivesons\" and \"adoptivedaughters\" -->\n| stepchildren     = <!-- Or \"stepsons\" and \"stepdaughters\" -->\n| grandchildren    = <!-- Or \"grandsons\" and \"granddaughters\" -->\n| grandparents     = <!-- Or \"grandfathers\" and \"grandmothers\" -->\n| aunts/uncles     = <!-- Or \"uncles\" and \"aunts\" -->\n| nieces/nephews   = <!-- Or \"nephews\" and \"nieces\" -->\n| cousins          = <!-- First cousins only -->\n| relatives        = <!-- For any other relative not listed above who is essential to the understanding of the character -->\n}}\n'''Warren Bauer''', portrayed by [[Bradley Cole]], was introduced as the father of [[Kiefer Bauer]] ([[Christian Alexander]]) on March 17, 2010.\n\n===Casting===\nThe cast was announced on February 9, 2010 by Cole himself on ''[[Twitter]]''.

However, Warren refuses to blame his son and blames the enemies of Kristina's mob boss father, [[Sonny Corinthos]] ([[Maurice Benard]]) for the attack. Due to the ongoing investigation, Warren reminds Kiefer that he never approved of his relationship with Kristina. When Kiefer is killed in a hit and run accident, Warren believes Kristina's mother, [[Alexis Davis|Alexis]] ([[Nancy Lee Grahn]]) killed his son on purpose, and vows revenge. Warren and wife [[#Melinda Bauer|Melinda]] ([[Lisa Waltz]]) post an online memorial page portraying Kiefer as a great student and great person and openly accuse Alexis of killing their son. He also accuses [[Ethan Lovett]] ([[Nathan Parsons]]) of being Kristina's \"real\" attacker. Warren tries to guilt Kristina into falsely accusing Ethan once again by reminding her of Kiefer's love. Warren continues pressuring the police to press charges and continues attacking Kristina and Alexis in public. When Alexis is acquitted, Warren files a wrongful death suit. Warren even pressures federal prosecutor, [[#Claire Walsh|Claire Walsh]] ([[Dahlia Salem]]) to press charges against Alexis. When Warren gets too aggressive with Alexis and her daughters in public, Sonny openly accuses Warren of abusing his son. In late July, Warren attempts but fails to obtain Kristina's medical records at General Hospital and threatens to sue for obstruction of justice. Warren runs into Kristina and nearly hits her when she berates him for abusing Kiefer, forcing her brother, [[Michael Corinthos|Michael]] ([[Chad Duell]]), to step in. A fight ensues with Lucky pulling Michael off Warren. When police commissioner [[Mac Scorpio]] ([[John J. York]]) arrives, Warren snaps and pulls a gun, shooting Mac and Ethan.

Later, she lures Nathan to her hotel room, hoping to talk to him. Maxie, at the same time, finds out who Claudette is, and the two leave. Though Claudette says she's not after Nathan, Maxie is suspicious of her. Claudette reunites with [[Griffin Munro]] ([[Matt Cohen (actor)|Matt Cohen]]), the man with whom she cheated on Nathan. Griffin is not happy, though, and says he's ashamed of their affair. Claudette says that she still loves him and hopes they'll be together.

The role has been portrayed by [[Michael Easton]] since May 13, 2013.\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:MichaelEastonCrop.jpg|thumbnail|100px|left|Michael Easton portrays Silas.]]\n\nFollowing the cancellation of fellow ABC daytime soap opera ''[[One Life to Live]]'' in January 2012, it was announced that Michael Easton, who had portrayed the role of [[John McBain (One Life to Live)|John McBain]] on the series since October 2003, would bring his character over to ''General Hospital'', after a venture to bring ''One Life to Live'' online had fallen apart. Easton had portrayed the character of McBain on ''General Hospital'' for little less than a year before it was announced that the efforts to bring ''One Life to Live'' online had begun again, and thus they were recalling the character of John McBain (as well as two other former ''One Life to Live'' characters) back to the parent series. As Easton was still under contract with ABC at this time, the decision was made to reintroduce the actors to ''General Hospital'' as brand new characters. Prior to his role on ''One Life to Live'', Easton had portrayed the role of vampire [[Caleb Morley]] on the defunct ''General Hospital'' spinoff, ''[[Port Charles]]'', from May 2001 to October 2003. In early 2013, Easton's portrayal of Morley was revisited on ''General Hospital'', with the series retconning the entire Morley identity as an alter ego of psychotic serial killer [[#Stephen Clay|Stephen Clay]]. In Easton's new role as Dr. Silas Clay, he serves as Stephen's older brother, as well as the paternal uncle of Stephen's son, [[Rafe Kovich, Jr.]], with any and all references to John McBain in the ''General Hospital'' canon eliminated. On July 29, 2015, it was confirmed that Easton would depart ''General Hospital'' in the role of Silas.<ref name=\"Silas\">{{cite web|last1=Giddens |first1=Jamey |title=Confirmed: Michael Easton Out at ''General Hospital''!

He clarifies that he's his older brother. Silas comes to Port Charles to meet his nephew, [[Rafe Kovich, Jr.]] (Jimmy Deshler), but Rafe's taken aback, because of Silas' resemblance to Stephen, and turns Silas down. Silas, though, petitions for custody of Rafe from Sam, his legal guardian. At the court hearing, he trashes Sam's image and, outraged, Sam confronts him. Instead, she finds him examining her son, [[Daniel Morgan (General Hospital)|Danny]]. Silas says that Danny might be sick, but Sam walks away, discounting his observation. Sam takes Danny to the hospital, where he's diagnosed with cancer. Silas chooses to stay in town and help with Danny's care, giving up his petition for custody of Rafe. During Danny's treatment, he and Sam grow closer.\n\nSilas later encounters [[Ava Jerome]] ([[Maura West]]), his old flame, and her daughter, [[Kiki Jerome|Kiki]] ([[Kristen Alderson]]). Though Ava denies it initially, Silas later finds out that Kiki is his daughter. He and Kiki start to bond, and Silas starts dating Sam. When Detective [[Nathan West (General Hospital)|Nathan West]] ([[Ryan Paevey]]) starts questioning Silas about a cold case, Sam finds out that Silas is married. Silas admits it, and reveals that his wife, [[Nina Reeves|Nina]], has been in a coma for 20 years. He blames himself, because he was having an affair with Ava, and believes she attempted suicide when she found out. However, he finds out Nathan suspects Silas tried to kill her. Sam helps prove his innocence by revealing that Nina's mother, [[Madeline Reeves]] ([[Donna Mills]]), was the one responsible. Nina ([[Michelle Stafford]]) returns soon after, waking up from her coma. She moves in with Silas, who takes care of her, but still dates Sam. Though Nina insists she's fine with Silas moving on, Sam is suspicious.\n\nWhen Rafe dies in a car accident, Silas is devastated, and accuses [[Patrick Drake]] ([[Jason Thompson (actor)|Jason Thompson]]), Rafe's doctor, of intentionally killing him since Rafe caused an accident that killed Patrick's [[Children of General Hospital#Gabriel Santiago|son]]. Sam, though, defends Patrick, and she and Silas break up. Silas realizes that Patrick did not kill Rafe, but also finds out Nina intentionally sabotaged his relationship with Sam as revenge for him sleeping with Ava.\n\nHaving lost Sam for good, Silas helps out Kiki and Ava, who is in hiding after committing murder. When Nina steals Ava's newborn daughter, [[Avery Corinthos|Avery]], Silas helps Kiki bring Avery home. Ava is sent to prison, and Silas helps Kiki take care of Avery. When Ava escapes from prison, she is presumed dead after being shot. However, Silas saves her, and hides her in a facility, where he reveals she's dying of cancer. Though Ava is ready to die, Silas saves her by kidnapping Avery, and taking her bone marrow to save Ava's life. Ava returns to Port Charles under an alias, hoping to get close to Avery. Though Silas knows the truth, she blackmails him with Avery's kidnapping to stay silent. Soon after, Silas is found dead. His killer is revealed to be Madeline, who killed Silas to get her hands on Nina's inheritance.<ref name=\"Silas\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.movienewsguide.com/general-hospital-murder-mystery-month-kiki-jerome-dr-silas-clay-killer/81237|accessdate=March 13, 2016|date=August 6, 2015|title='General Hospital' Murder Mystery to Last Only a Month; Kiki Jerome Dr. Silas Clay Killer|work=Movie News Guide|location=United States|first=Martin|last=Suan|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313121840/http://www.movienewsguide.com/general-hospital-murder-mystery-month-kiki-jerome-dr-silas-clay-killer/81237|archive-date=March 13, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Fairman|first1=Michael|title=General Hospital: Silas Is Murdered!

The character is an adaptation of the fictional vampire character [[Caleb Morley]], originated by Easton on the ''General Hospital'' spin-off ''Port Charles'' from 2001\u20132003.  When Caleb was killed at the end of \"Tempted,\" he eventually returned during the story arc \"Naked Eyes,\" this time in the guise of the vampire rock star \"Stephen Clay.\" Caleb Morley aka Stephen Clay remained a fan favorite and primary character until the cancellation of ''Port Charles'' in October 2003. Easton joined the cast of ''One Life to Live'', where he played the role of John McBain until its cancellation in January 2012 and then brought the character of McBain to ''General Hospital''. In 2013, writers decided to revisit Caleb's storyline from ''Port Charles'' and adapt it into the ''General Hospital'' storylines.\n\n===Storylines===\n[[File:MichaelEastonCrop.jpg|thumbnail|100px|left|Michael Easton plays Stephen.]]\nIn January 2013, [[Lucy Coe]], having recently returned to Port Charles after a ten-year absence, has a run-in with Detective John McBain. Lucy claims McBain is a vampire named Caleb Morley, and attempts to stake him in the chest. She is arrested and eventually sent to Ferncliff [[sanatorium]]. In the wake of her hospitalization, her estranged husband [[Kevin Collins (General Hospital)|Kevin Collins]] returns, stating Lucy's claims of Caleb's existence are merely a psychotic delusion. Meanwhile, Alison Barrington returns to Port Charles, with her teenage son, Rafe Kovich, Jr. Alison also mistakes McBain for Caleb, prompting her to flee. Alison is confronted by Caleb, who kills her. McBain arrives and finds a visibly shaken Rafe holding the murder weapon. Rafe is detained as the primary suspect, and when questioned by Police Commissioner [[Anna Devane]], claims McBain murdered his mother. Meanwhile, Lucy, having learned of Alison's murder, stages a breakout from Ferncliff, with the assistance of [[Heather Webber (General Hospital)|Heather Webber]] and [[Todd Manning]], determined to protect Rafe.\n\nMeanwhile, Caleb poses as McBain and removes Rafe from police custody. He kills a police officer and tries to take Rafe out of Port Charles, but Rafe runs away. He visits a professor at Port Charles University and kills him when he reveals he knows about Caleb. While he's there, [[Sam Morgan (General Hospital)|Sam Morgan]] comes to PCU looking for the professor. Caleb becomes fixated on her, believing she's [[Livvie Locke]], his former wife. Caleb goes to the pier, where Heather is with Sam's son, [[Daniel Morgan (General Hospital)|Danny]]. Caleb chokes Heather and throws her into the water. He tries to take Danny but Todd stops him. After the police leave, he finds Sam and Danny on the pier and kidnaps them. Meanwhile, John, Lucy, and Rafe break out of police custody to try to save Sam and Danny. John heads to PCU, and finds out \"Caleb\" is actually Stephen Clay, a former rock musician who went insane after the death of his wife, Livvie. Clay played the persona of a vampire onstage and, after his wife died, he believed he was an actual vampire and went on a killing spree before being arrested and thrown into a mental institution he escaped from. Meanwhile, \"Caleb\" takes Sam and Danny to Wyndemere, telling Sam they'll be reunited once he bites her three times. John, Lucy, and Rafe arrive to find Danny alone. \"Caleb\" ties Sam up in the tunnels but eventually John and Lucy arrive and kill him. Later, Lucy views Stephen's body at the morgue she notices the ring is missing, when Anna gets Lucy out of the morgue. It is revealed the morgue attendant had the ring and when he tries it on, the young attendant is seen lying dead as the figure walks off meaning there really wasn't a Stephen Clay, but Caleb Morley, the vampire, again using his former alias.\n{{clear right}}\n\n==Brad Cooper==\n{{Infobox soap character\n| name             = Brad Cooper\n| series           = General Hospital\n| portrayer        = {{Plainlist |\n* Unknown actor (2013)\n* [[Parry Shen]] (2013\u2013)\n}}\n| years            = 2013\u2013\n| first            = February 13, 2013\n| last             =\n| creator          = [[Ron Carlivati]]\n| introducer       = [[Frank Valentini]]\n| books            =\n| spinoffs         =\n| crossover        =\n| classification   = [[List of General Hospital cast members#Recurring cast|Present; recurring]]\n| image1           = <!-- File:FILENAME.jpg  (No linking required) -->\n| imagesize1       = <!-- Defaults to 240px -->\n| imagealt1        =\n| caption1         =\n| image2           = <!-- For alternate performer only -->\n| imagesize2       = <!-- Defaults to 240px -->\n| imagealt2        =\n| caption2         =\n| image3           = <!-- For alternate performer only -->\n| imagesize3       = <!-- Defaults to 240px -->\n| imagealt3        =\n| caption3         =\n| alias            =\n| occupation       = Lab technician \n| residence        = [[Port Charles (fictional city)|Port Charles]], [[New York (state)|New York]]\n| family           =\n| father           = [[List of General Hospital characters#S|Kim Soong Wu]]\n| adoptiveparents  = \n| stepparents      = \n| siblings         = \n| spouse = {{Plainlist |\n* Rosalie Martinez (divorced)\n* [[Lucas Jones]] (2016\u2013)\n}}\n| civilpartner     =\n| adoptivesons = {{Plainlist|\n* Wylie Cooper-Jones \n* [[Children of General Hospital#Jonah Corinthos|Jonah Corinthos]] (illegal)<ref name=GH072618>{{Cite episode |series= General Hospital |series-link= General Hospital |credits= [[Shelly Altman]] and [[Chris Van Etten]] ([[Head writer]]s); [[Scott McKinsey]] ([[Television director|Director]]); Suzanne Flynn ([[Screenwriter|Script writer]]) |network= [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] |date= July 26, 2018 |season= 56 |number=14087|language= English}}</ref><ref name=GH073018>{{Cite episode |series= General Hospital |series-link= General Hospital |credits= [[Shelly Altman]] and [[Chris Van Etten]] ([[Head writer]]s); Denise Van Cleve ([[Television director|Director]]); Kate Hall ([[Screenwriter|Script writer]]) |network= [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] |date= July 30, 2018 |season= 56 |number=14089|language= English}}</ref><ref name=GH073118>{{Cite episode |series= General Hospital |series-link= General Hospital |credits= [[Shelly Altman]] and [[Chris Van Etten]] ([[Head writer]]s); William Ludel ([[Television director|Director]]); [[Elizabeth Korte]] ([[Screenwriter|Script writer]]) |network= [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] |date= July 31, 2018 |season= 56 |number=14090|language= English}}</ref><ref name=GH080218>{{Cite episode |series= General Hospital |series-link= General Hospital |credits= [[Shelly Altman]] and [[Chris Van Etten]] ([[Head writer]]s); William Ludel ([[Television director|Director]]); Charlotte Gibson ([[Screenwriter|Script writer]]) |network= [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] |date= August 2, 2018 |season= 56 |number=14092|language= English}}</ref>\n}}\n| adoptivechildren = \n| stepchildren     = \n| grandchildren    = \n| grandparents     = \n| aunts            = [[List of General Hospital characters#S|Jade Soong]]\n| nieces/nephews   = \n| cousins          = \n| relatives        = [[List of General Hospital characters#W|Mr. Wu]]\n}}\n'''Bradley \"Brad\" Cooper''' was introduced to the series on February 13, 2013, played by an unknown actor.

Trey is the producer of Kristina's reality television show ''Mob Princess'', and manipulates her into continuing the show despite her family's disapproval. Trey immediately clashes with Kristina's parents, [[Alexis Davis]] and mob boss Sonny Corinthos. He convinces Sonny to agree to the reality show while keeping his mysterious boss up-to-date on the project. Trey moves into his new apartment and clashes with his roommate, [[Starr Manning]]. Meanwhile, Kristina's brother, [[Michael Corinthos|Michael]] accuses Trey of manipulating and using both Kristina and Starr, though he denies it. Trey continues to make enemies when it comes to Starr's father, [[Todd Manning|Todd]], while he is oblivious to the fact that Kristina has a crush on him. Meanwhile, Trey bashes Sonny's girlfriend [[Kate Howard]] when it is revealed that her alternate personality caused the car accident killing Starr's family. Meanwhile, Kristina reveals her true feelings for Trey and they share their first kiss in July 2012; however, Trey is hesitant about getting involved with her fearing it will interfere with the show. It is soon revealed that Trey is actually the son of Sonny's longtime nemesis [[#Joe Scully, Jr.|Joe Scully Jr]], who is financing the show. Kristina continues her flirtatious behavior while Trey becomes determined to catch Sonny doing something illegal on camera. Trey is shocked to find his father in prison in [[Atlantic City]]. Joe admits that his father Joe Sr. was a mobster that Sonny used to work for, and convinces Trey to keep his true identity a secret so they can get revenge on Sonny for framing him for murder. He also coerces Trey into ending the reality show and romancing Kristina. In late August, Joe coerces Trey into eloping with Kristina [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]. Trey leads Kristina to believe that they have to get married for the show so he won't be sued. In September 2012, Trey has a confrontation with Kate, who recognizes a medal that he was wearing as being identical to one that Joe wore the night he raped her, leading her to realize that Trey is the son she conceived as the result of the rape. This revelation prompts Kate's alter, Connie, to emerge, and she proceeds to tell Trey that she wished he had never been born. In October 2012, Joe abducts Kristina on orders from [[Cesar Faison]], who intends to have Joe kill her in an convoluted effort to gain control of Sonny's assets. Trey attempts to wrestle the gun away from Joe, but inadvertently ends up shooting him the shoulder, resulting in Joe fleeing the scene before he can fulfill Faison's orders. Subsequently, Trey's connection to Joe is revealed, prompting Kristina to end her marriage to him, and Trey is evicted from the apartment he shared with [[Starr Manning]] by its original owner, [[Maxie Jones]]. Trey spends the next few months living at the local church, all the while attempting to aid Sonny in his quest to have Connie committed to Shadybrook Sanitarium, which ultimately fails. As time goes on, Trey and Kristina reconcile, and plan to relocate to California. However, their plans are derailed when, on New Year's Eve, they are involved in a car accident, which causes an aneurysm in Trey's brain to rupture, rendering him brain dead on January 8, 2013.

When the two teenagers began dating, Josslyn's mother, Carly Corinthos ([[Laura Wright]]) became eager to meet Kim, which Oscar kept delaying due to Kim's long working hours. However, when Carly invited Kim to Thanksgiving dinner, she eagerly accepted the invitation. At the dinner, Kim met [[Jason Morgan (General Hospital)|Jason Morgan]] ([[Steve Burton (actor)|Steve Burton]]), who she recognized as Andrew Cain. Carly explained that Jason was Drew's twin brother, and that the two had been separated at birth. With Carly eager to know what Kim knew about Drew, who had been rendered amnesiac and had required facial reconstruction surgery due to injuries sustained in an auto accident, Kim explained she had casually dated Drew for a short time in San Diego. After Drew, who was a Navy SEAL, was redeployed, Kim discovered she was pregnant with Oscar and attempted to contact him, but was told that he deserted and eventually stopped looking for him. Years later, Kim had attempted to run Oscar's DNA through an ancestry site in order to locate Drew or any of his family due to Oscar's curiosity about his father. It was at this point that Kim learned that Oscar had family living in Port Charles, so she and Oscar relocated in order to find Drew and his family. Shocked to discover that Oscar was Quartermaine following her move from Mercy Hospital to General Hospital, Kim was greeted warmly by chief of staff [[Monica Quartermaine|Dr. Monica Quartermaine]] ([[Leslie Charleson]]), Oscar's grandmother. Despite having no memory of his relationship with Kim, Drew ([[Billy Miller (actor)|Billy Miller]]) was eager to build a relationship with Oscar. In an effort to spark some memory of his past, Kim gave Drew a CD of music that he had made for her before he left San Diego, for which he was grateful. With no indication that Drew recalled their past or harbored any romantic feelings towards her, Kim focused on her role at General Hospital and struck up a friendship with [[Julian Jerome]] ([[William deVry]]), which later turned into a romantic relationship. In September 2018, Oscar was revealed to be dying of an inoperable Grade IV Glioblastoma, which had Kim had been aware of for two years without telling him. Oscar was furious with his mother for lying to him and began to drift toward a cult led by Hank \"Shiloh\" Archer (Coby Ryan McLaughlin), but never became substantially involved with them. On New Years, Kim kissed Drew, and in his anger Julian ended his relationship with her, even going so far to lie about sleeping with someone else. After some time, Kim and Julian were able to reconcile their relationship. In March 2019, Dr. Terry Randolph (Cassandra James) informed Kim, Drew and Oscar that the Glioblastoma had advanced, and Oscar had only six months to live. On April 29, 2019, three and half weeks after experiencing a severe seizure, Oscar died surrounded by Josslyn, Kim and Drew at the Quartermaine Mansion. Oscar was cremated and honoring his wishes, a devastated Kim and Drew climbed to the summit of Kilimanjaro and scattered his ashes there. In her grief, Kim began to spiral out of control, becoming obsessed with having another baby. After failing to convince Julian to conceive a child with her, she drugged and attempted to rape Drew at the wedding reception for [[Franco Baldwin]] ([[Roger Howarth]]) and [[Elizabeth Webber]] ([[Rebecca Herbst]]) as an alternative. Julian, recognizing that Kim was losing control, was able to stop her and after waking up and realizing what had happened, Drew opted not to press charges against her. In August 2019, a flash drive containing Drew's memories prior to arriving in Port Charles was stolen by Shiloh, who had kidnapped [[Cameron Webber]] ([[William Lipton]]) and attempted to implant them into his brain. Having been discovered by Franco, he opted to take Cameron's place in the experiment, and once he woke up, firmly believed himself to be Drew Cain. After running into Kim at General Hospital, Franco began relaying memories of Drew's past with Kim to her as if he himself had lived them. Distressed and demanding answers as to what was going, Elizabeth and the real Drew explained everything to her. Shortly thereafter, Drew left Port Charles in an effort to locate Dr. Andre Maddox ([[Anthony Montgomery]]), who he believed stood the best chance of restoring Franco to his former self. When Drew was declared dead after his plane has crashed, Kim began to fall in love with Franco and became convinced that she had a second shot at the relationship she had missed out on years earlier with Drew. Desperate for a future with \"Drew\" free of his ties to all of Franco's loved ones, Kim sought help from attorney Martin Gray ([[Michael E. Knight]]) in an effort to grant Franco the right to live his life as Drew Cain. As their relationship deepened, the two made plans to leave Port Charles and begin their life together. Following a conversation with [[Scott Baldwin]] ([[Kin Shriner]]), who explained to \"Drew\" that Franco had protected him from sexual predator Jim Harvey as a child, \"Drew\" informed Kim that he couldn't leave with her, and that he owed it to Franco to try to give him his life back, effectively ending their relationship.

He believes that Nina overdosed when she found out about his affair with [[Ava Jerome]], and has been in a coma for 20 years. However, Nina's brother, Detective [[Nathan West (General Hospital)|Nathan West]], believes Silas tried to kill her, and investigates the case. He finds out that it was actually Nina's mother [[Madeline Reeves]], who tried to kill Nina, because Nina was pregnant with Silas' child. She wanted to get rid of Nina's baby, and accidentally put her own daughter in a coma. Madeline tells Nathan that Nina has died, but later says that she only had Nina declared dead to get the inheritance that was left to Nina by Madeline's late husband.\n\nNina first appears onscreen in May 2014, waking up from her coma. Roughly a month later, Nina arrives in Port Charles, and shocks a bewildered Silas with her presence. Both Silas and Nathan are happy that she's alive, but Nina soon has to find out that much has changed. She is introduced to [[Kiki Jerome]], Silas' daughter with Ava. Silas is also now dating [[Sam McCall|Sam Morgan]], despite Nina still showing an interest in him. After first not being aware that Silas and Sam are a couple, Nina claims to be fine with it; accepting the end of her marriage; and tells Silas that it would only be natural for his life to go on. However it is later revealed that Nina has been awake for longer than she says and that she trashed Silas' apartment a few months back. Nina in fact wants revenge on everyone that wronged her. Nina married [[Ric Lansing]] on May 18, 2015.\n\nIn November 2015, Nina goes to [[Julian Jerome]], who owns ''Crimson'' magazine under his media empire, for a job. She ends up getting the job of [[editor-in-chief]] since the former had left the magazine. She works closely with [[Maxie Jones]]. When Nina and Maxie need someone to take pictures for the Nutcracker Gala, Maxie has an idea that [[Dillon Quartermaine]] (Robert Palmer Watkins) should stay in town, work for Nina, and take pictures of everyone at the Gala.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://michaelfairmansoaps.com/news/general-hospital-previews-their-nutcracker-gala-with-first-look-photos/2015/12/06/|accessdate=December 29, 2015|date=December 6, 2015|work=Michael Fairman On-Air On-Soaps|last1=Fairman|first1=Michael|title=General Hospital Previews Their Nutcracker Gala With First Look Photos!}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ghdailydish.blogspot.com/2015/12/the-nutcracker-gala.html|accessdate=December 29, 2015|date=December 21, 2015|work=GH Daily Blog|title=The Nutcracker Gala}}</ref> In October 2018, a DNA test is arranged by Valentin (James Patrick Stuart) and confirms that Sasha Gilmore is Nina's daughter; however, it is later revealed that Valentin hired her to pretend to be her daughter.

Though she rejects him, Carlos plants seeds of doubt in her about Patrick's devotion because he is still wearing his wedding ring. Carlos is eventually revealed to be the mob enforcer for [[Julian Jerome]]. Days before Patrick and Sabrina's wedding, Carlos sees Robin Scorpio, Patrick's presumed dead wife and Sonny's presumed dead friend alive. He tells Sabrina, but she refuses to believe him. Carlos is later kidnapped by rival mob boss Sonny Corinthos, and lies about claiming to be the brother of Sonny's late [[Lily Corinthos|Lily]] (Lilly Melgar) hoping it will keep him alive. However, it is revealed that Carlos is lying, but before Sonny's henchman, [[Shawn Butler]] can kill him, Carlos escapes with help from [[TJ Ashford]]. Carlos is shot during a shootout, and makes his way to Sabrina's. When Sabrina learns she is pregnant, Carlos claims to be the father despite knowing the child is Patrick's. Sabrina tells the truth to Patrick about him being the child's father and not Carlos. Carlos is then arrested for the murder of [[AJ Quartermaine]]. [[Ava Jerome]] visits him and threatens him if he babbles the truth about AJ then she will hurt Sabrina. So for Sabrina's sake, he pleads guilty. When Sabrina visits him in jail, he lies to her that he killed AJ and that he was lying to her all this time. Unable to bear the pain, Sabrina leaves. Months later, Sabrina visits Carlos in jail to fill him in on how she found out the truth, indicating that she is no longer upset with him. In May 2015, Carlos kills [[Duke Lavery]] by delivering a fatal gunshot wound to his abdomen. In retaliation, Carlos is killed by Anna Devane on the docks of the Port Charles Harbor. In late November 2015, Carlos shows up at Sabrina's door. Apparently, Rivera had not died. He sees that Sabrina is pregnant and thinks the baby is his. At first she denies it, but when he overhears a private conversation between Felix and her, he realizes that the baby is his and not the child of [[Michael Corinthos]], Sabrina's boyfriend. Sabrina still wants to keep the secret, feeling Carlos is dangerous to be around. However, when Michael finds out the truth, he leaves Sabrina, and she decides to go on the run with Carlos. Their son is born while they are fugitives, and they run with the help of [[Paul Hornsby]]. Carlos is found by Sonny and Anna in Colombia, and they bring him back to Port Charles to stand trial for murdering Duke. However, Carlos threatens Paul to help him escape. Carlos manages to escape from the prisoner transport van, and calls Julian for help to find a way out of town. Julian, though, stabs Carlos and throws him into the harbor. He's found by Michael, who brings him to the hospital, where Carlos succumbs to his injuries.\n{{clear right}}\n\n==Aaron Roland==\n{{Infobox soap character\n| name           = Aaron Roland\n| series         = General Hospital\n| portrayer      = [[John DeLuca]]\n| creator        = [[Shelly Altman]] and [[Jean Passanante]]\n| years     = 2016\n| first          = April 27, 2016\n| last = August 11, 2016\n| classification = [[List of previous General Hospital cast members|Former; recurring]]\n| occupation     = Manager of ''Perks Coffee'' (2016\u2013)\n}}\n'''Aaron Roland''', played by [[John DeLuca]], was introduced in April 2016 and departed in August 2016.

However, Barbeau was relieved that she did not know of Suzanne's true identity immediately because it would've made it more challenging to play the character.

Sonny and Brenda confront Suzanne about her schemes and she claims she is worried Sonny's enemies will target Brenda.

After Theo kidnaps Brenda with the help of [[Shawn Butler]] ([[Sean Blakemore]]), it is revealed that Brenda gave birth to Aleksander's stillborn son with Suzanne by her side. Theo immediately assumes the child lived as it was Suzanne who witnessed the birth. Though denying Theo's accusations, she harbors resentment toward her husband for allowing their son into the criminal life. During Theo's search for their grandson, Suzanne kills him. Suzanne continues to raise her grandson in secret, but to keep Brenda and Sonny from finding him, she presents Brenda with another little boy named Lucian, and pretends he is the child. When Sonny demands a DNA test, Suzanne kidnaps the boy and skips town. Fortunately, Suzanne is found in [[San Antonio]] with Brenda's biological son, Alec. Brenda meets her son, and Suzanne is arrested.\n\n===Reception===\nMichael Logan said, \"If you can hold your own against Maude, those mobsters in Port Charles should be a cinch!\" Logan also praised the character's name as \"best soap name ever!\" Logan said the character would make a good match for [[Anthony Geary]]'s [[Luke Spencer]].<ref name=\"TVG 1019870\"/> On ''Soaps She Knows'', fans hoped for Barbeau's pairing with Geary, while some also voted for a potential pairing with [[Tristan Rogers]]'s [[Robert Scorpio]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://soaps.sheknows.com/generalhospital/news/id/9907/|title=Adrienne Barbeau Joins General Hospital|work=Soaps She Knows|date=June 24, 2010|accessdate=October 5, 2013}}</ref> ''TV Guide'' described Suzanne's reveal as The Balkan's wife as a \"jaw-dropper\" and \"stunning revelation.\"<ref name=\"TVG1029526\"/>\n{{clear right}}\n\n==Ellie Trout==\n{{Infobox soap character\n| name           = Ellie Trout\n| series         = General Hospital\n| portrayer      = [[Emily Wilson (actress)|Emily Wilson]]\n| years          = {{Flatlist |\n* 2012\u201316 \n}}\n| first          = September 14, 2012\n| last           = January 4, 2016\n| creator        = [[Ron Carlivati]]\n| introducer     = [[Frank Valentini]]\n| books          =\n| spinoffs       =\n| image1         = <!-- File:FILENAME.jpg  (No linking required) -->\n| caption1       =\n| classification = [[List of General Hospital cast members#Regular cast|Former; recurring]]\n| alias          = Ellen Trout\n| occupation     = Lab technician\n| residence      = [[Portland, Oregon]]\n| aunts = Ellen\n}}\n'''Ellie Trout''' is a fictional character from the ABC Daytime soap opera ''General Hospital''.

{"title_page": "The Origin of Capitalism", "text_new": "{{italic title}}\n'''''The Origin of Capitalism''''' is a 1999 book on [[history]] and [[political economy]], specifically the [[history of capitalism]], by scholar [[Ellen Meiksins Wood]], written from the perspective of [[Political Marxism]]. It was reviewed as an \"Outstanding Academic Book\" by [[Michael Perelman (economist)|Michael Perelman]].<ref name=\"Perelman\"/>\n\n==Summary==\n\nThe book is divided into three sections. The following summary is based on the second edition (though some references are to the first).\n\nWood's [[Marxist]] approach originates from [[Karl Marx]]'s critique of [[political economy]] in his works ''[[Das Kapital]]'' and ''[[Grundrisse]]''.<ref>1999, p. 35.</ref> In the capitalist form of society, human [[labor power]] is for sale in the market as one of many commodities.<ref name=\"1999, p. 2\">1999, p. 2.</ref> Goods and services, including those regarding the most basic necessities of life, are produced for profitable exchange.<ref name=\"1999, p. 2\"/> All the actors in a such system are driven by [[competition]] and [[profit (economics)|profit]]-maximization.<ref name=\"1999, p. 2\"/> However, the study presents capitalists' appropriation of \"workers' surplus labor without coercion\"<ref name=\"1999, p. 70\">1999, p. 70.</ref> by using the market to set rates of compensation both for wages and for appropriation<ref name=\"1999, p. 70\"/> as the most distinctive and historically important feature of capitalism. Thus it argues that the origin of capitalism lies fundamentally in social property relations rather than in trade and commerce.\n\nWood argues that past historians have tended to see capitalism as a natural and even inevitable human behaviour, which came into being when barriers to trade and commerce were removed: essentially, in their understanding, people were waiting for the ''opportunity'' to become capitalists. Wood argues rather that capitalism did not come about until a set of unique historical circumstances ''compelled'' people to.\n\n===Part I, 'Histories of the Transition'===\n\nIn Part I, Wood surveys past work on the transition to capitalism. She sketches how [[Adam Smith]], [[Max Weber]], [[Fernand Braudel]], and [[Henri Pirenne]] assumed that capitalism naturally arises from trade, commerce, and urbanisation once city-dwellers have accumulated enough [[primitive capital]] to be able to reinvest it in production. However, she also finds that even commentators who were critical of this account tend to argue that the transition to capitalism entailed farmers seizing new opportunities to switch from subsistence to commodity production as the constraints of [[feudalism]] were loosened. Examples include [[Karl Marx]] himself, [[Karl Polanyi]], [[Paul Sweezy]], [[Maurice Dobb]], [[Rodney Hilton]], and [[Perry Anderson]]. This suggests that capitalism is a natural and inevitable behaviour, waiting for its opportunity, rather than historically unusual and specific. Building particularly on the arguments made in the [[Brenner Debate]] and on the work of [[E. P. Thompson]], Wood argues that 'we need a form of history that brings this specificity into sharp relief'.<ref>2002, p. 69.</ref>\n\n===Part II, 'The Origin of Capitalism'===\n\nIn Part II, Wood argues that capitalism emerged in the unique conditions of late medieval and early modern English agrarian society, basing her argument firmly on Robert Brenner's \u2018Agrarian Class Structure and Economic Development in Pre-Industrial Europe\u2019.<ref>Brenner, Robert (1976). \u2018Agrarian Class Structure and Economic Development in Pre-Industrial Europe,\u2019 ''Past & Present'', 70, February, pp. 30-75.</ref> She argues that commerce is not equivalent to capitalism and does not produce it because 'the dominant principle of trade everywhere was not surplus value derived from production but \"profit on alienation\", \"buying cheap and selling dear\" ':<ref>2002, p. 78.</ref> that is, although trade involves the seeking of profits, it does not in itself affect how goods are produced. Wood argues that polities which flourished from trade such as medieval [[Florence]] and the early-modern [[Dutch Republic]] that did not become capitalist are not examples of a 'failed transition', but rather examples of how trade and urbanisation has flourished widely in human history without capitalism developing. She likewise argues that various past societies, such as early modern France, had peasantries with ample opportunity to enter into commercial production, which, however, did not take this opportunity. Thus Wood concludes that capitalism must have arisen from changing ''imperatives'' in fundamental relations of ''production''.<ref name=\"Perelman\">Perelman, Oct. 1999</ref>\n\nWood sees these unique circumstances arising in [[Economy of England in the Middle Ages|late medieval]] and early-modern England (particularly the south-east). In the wake of the [[Norman Conquest]], the English state was unusually centralised. This gave aristocrats relatively limited powers to extract wealth directly from their feudal underlings through political means (not least the threat of violence). England's centralisation also meant that an unusual number of English farmers were not peasants (with their own land and thus direct access to subsistence) but [[Tenant farmer|tenants]] (renting their land). These circumstances produced a market in leases. Landlords, lacking other ways to extract wealth, were incentivised to rent to those tenants who could pay the most, while tenants, lacking security of tenure, were incentivised to farm as productively as possible to be able to win leases in a competitive market. This led to a cascade of effects whereby successful tenant farmers became agrarian capitalists; unsuccessful ones became wage-labourers, required to sell their labour in order to live; and landlords promoted the privatisation and renting out of common land, not least through the [[enclosures]].<ref name=obit>[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/10/ellen-meiksins-wood-obituary  David McNally, \"Ellen Meiksins Wood obituary\" ''The Guardian''].</ref> 'It was not merchants or manufacturers who drove the process that propelled the early development of capitalism. The transformation of social property relations was firmly rooted in the countryside, and the transformation of England's trade and industry was result more than cause of England's transition to capitalism'.<ref>2002, p. 129.</ref>\n\n===Part III, 'Agrarian Capitalism and Beyond'===\n\nIn Part III, Wood sketches how industrial capitalism developed from its agrarian English origins. She argues that the end of subsistence farming produced a large population which needed both to sell its labour and to buy basic necessities of life, creating a mass consumer market quite different from the markets for luxury goods that characterised non-capitalist commerce. This mass market underpinned the development of mass production.\n\nWood argues that England's rising productivity slowly but inevitably forced competing economies to enter capitalist modes of production: although the development of capitalism was a chance event, it set in motion a transition that would become global. She argues that English capitalism did not cause England's imperialism, noting that neighbouring non-capitalist economies like Spain and France also built overseas empires. She does find, however, that English capitalism produced a distinctive kind of imperialism. Rather than ruling purely through 'extra-economic' methods of exerting power (such as force), England exported its model of social property relations to its colonies, providing powerful economic imperatives for people to adopt capitalism. English imperialism also drew on the nascent capitalist ideology of thinkers such as [[Thomas More]], [[Sir John Davies]], [[John Locke]], and [[William Petty]] to justify taking the land of peoples who were thought not to be making sufficiently productive use of it.\n\nWood sketches the reliance of capitalism on the political structures of the [[nation-state]] (particularly its protection of private property), and emphasises that the humane and universalist ideas of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] emerged in the still non-capitalist France of the eighteenth century, setting Enlightenment ideas in contrast to capitalist ideologies. Finally, she emphasises that if capitalism is a historically specific and unusual development, it is not inevitable or the only way that humans might organise themselves.\n\n==Editions==\nThe book was originally published in 1999 by [[Monthly Review]] Press, and then a revised<ref>According to the Acknowledgements, the second edition is \"...substantially revised and expanded...\"</ref> edition was published in 2002 by [[Verso Books]], with the subtitle \"A Longer View\".<ref>Copyright notice on the 2002 edition</ref> A reprint appeared in 2013 and again in 2017.\n\n* [[Ellen Meiksins Wood|Wood, Ellen Meiksins]] (1999) ''The Origin of Capitalism'', [[Monthly Review]] Press, 1999. {{ISBN|1-58367-000-9}}, 120 pp.\n* Wood, Ellen Meiksins (2002) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=FZPyKjVguVoC The Origin of Capitalism: A Longer View]'', [[Verso Books]], 2002.  {{ISBN|978-1-85984-392-5}}, 213 pp.\n* Wood, Ellen Meiksins (2013) ''The Origin of Capitalism: A Longer View'', Aakar Books, 2013. {{ISBN|978-93-5002-241-2}}, 224 pp.\n*Wood, Ellen Meiksins (2017) ''The Origin of Capitalism: A Longer View'', Verso Books, 2017.

It was reviewed as an \"Outstanding Academic Book\" by [[Michael Perelman (economist)|Michael Perelman]].<ref name=\"Perelman\"/>\n\n==Summary==\n\nThe book is divided into three sections. The following summary is based on the second edition (though some references are to the first).\n\nWood's [[Marxist]] approach originates from [[Karl Marx]]'s critique of [[political economy]] in his works ''[[Das Kapital]]'' and ''[[Grundrisse]]''.<ref>1999, p. 35.</ref> In the capitalist form of society, human [[labor power]] is for sale in the market as one of many commodities.<ref name=\"1999, p. 2\">1999, p. 2.</ref> Goods and services, including those regarding the most basic necessities of life, are produced for profitable exchange.<ref name=\"1999, p. 2\"/> All the actors in a such system are driven by [[competition]] and [[profit (economics)|profit]]-maximization.<ref name=\"1999, p. 2\"/> However, the study presents capitalists' appropriation of \"workers' surplus labor without coercion\"<ref name=\"1999, p. 70\">1999, p. 70.</ref> by using the market to set rates of compensation both for wages and for appropriation<ref name=\"1999, p. 70\"/> as the most distinctive and historically important feature of capitalism. Thus it argues that the origin of capitalism lies fundamentally in social property relations rather than in trade and commerce.\n\nWood argues that past historians have tended to see capitalism as a natural and even inevitable human behaviour, which came into being when barriers to trade and commerce were removed: essentially, in their understanding, people were waiting for the ''opportunity'' to become capitalists. Wood argues rather that capitalism did not come about until a set of unique historical circumstances ''compelled'' people to.\n\n===Part I, 'Histories of the Transition'===\n\nIn Part I, Wood surveys past work on the transition to capitalism. She sketches how [[Adam Smith]], [[Max Weber]], [[Fernand Braudel]], and [[Henri Pirenne]] assumed that capitalism naturally arises from trade, commerce, and urbanisation once city-dwellers have accumulated enough [[primitive capital]] to be able to reinvest it in production. However, she also finds that even commentators who were critical of this account tend to argue that the transition to capitalism entailed farmers seizing new opportunities to switch from subsistence to commodity production as the constraints of [[feudalism]] were loosened. Examples include [[Karl Marx]] himself, [[Karl Polanyi]], [[Paul Sweezy]], [[Maurice Dobb]], [[Rodney Hilton]], and [[Perry Anderson]]. This suggests that capitalism is a natural and inevitable behaviour, waiting for its opportunity, rather than historically unusual and specific. Building particularly on the arguments made in the [[Brenner Debate]] and on the work of [[E. P. Thompson]], Wood argues that 'we need a form of history that brings this specificity into sharp relief'.<ref>2002, p. 69.</ref>\n\n===Part II, 'The Origin of Capitalism'===\n\nIn Part II, Wood argues that capitalism emerged in the unique conditions of late medieval and early modern English agrarian society, basing her argument firmly on Robert Brenner's \u2018Agrarian Class Structure and Economic Development in Pre-Industrial Europe\u2019.<ref>Brenner, Robert (1976). \u2018Agrarian Class Structure and Economic Development in Pre-Industrial Europe,\u2019 ''Past & Present'', 70, February, pp. 30-75.</ref> She argues that commerce is not equivalent to capitalism and does not produce it because 'the dominant principle of trade everywhere was not surplus value derived from production but \"profit on alienation\", \"buying cheap and selling dear\" ':<ref>2002, p. 78.</ref> that is, although trade involves the seeking of profits, it does not in itself affect how goods are produced.
