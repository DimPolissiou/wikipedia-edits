He quickly became a [[wikt:Pioneer|pioneer]] of industrial food production, aiming to improve the nutritional intake of worker families. Maggi was the first to bring protein-rich [[legume]] meals to the market, and followed up with a ready-made soup based on legume meals in 1886.

In 1897, Julius Maggi founded the company Maggi GmbH in [[Singen]], [[Germany]].<ref>{{cite web|title =History of Maggi|url = https://www.maggime.com/en/about-us|website = www.nestle.com|access-date = 2017-08-07}}</ref>\n\nIn 1947, following several changes in ownership and corporate structure, Maggi's holding company merged with the Nestl\u00e9 company to form [[Nestl\u00e9 S.A.|Nestl\u00e9-Alimentana S.A.]], currently known in its [[francophone]] home base as Nestl\u00e9 S.A.<ref>{{cite web|title = FOOD HISTORY: History of Maggi brand of Nestl\u00e9|url = http://www.world-foodhistory.com/2014/03/history-of-maggi-brand-of-nestle.html|website = www.world-foodhistory.com|access-date = 2016-02-04}}</ref>\n\n==Products==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"220\">\nImage:Maggiw\u00fcrze-alt.jpg|Maggi Seasoning sauce (replica of a historic bottle)\nImage:Maggiw\u00fcrze-neu.jpg|A bottle of Maggi sauce in 2006\nImage:Br\u00fchw\u00fcrfel-1.jpg|Bouillon cubes\n</gallery>\n\n===Cube===\nThe [[bouillon cube]] or ''Maggi cube'' is a meat substitute product that was introduced in 1908.\n\nIn [[Germany]], [[Cameroon]], [[C\u00f4te d'Ivoire]], [[B\u00e9nin]], [[Gambia]], [[Senegal|S\u00e9n\u00e9gal]], [[Guinea]], [[Nigeria]], [[Ghana]], [[Burkina Faso]], [[Togo]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Liberia]], [[Mali]], [[Niger]], and [[Mauritania]] and parts of the [[Middle East]], Maggi cubes are an integral part of the local cuisine.

It spans [[the Narrows]], a body of water linking the relatively enclosed [[Upper New York Bay]] with [[Lower New York Bay]] and the Atlantic Ocean, and is the only fixed crossing of the Narrows. The [[double-deck bridge]] carries 13 lanes of [[Interstate 278]], with seven lanes on the upper level and six on the lower level. The span is named for [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]], the first documented European explorer to enter [[New York Harbor]] and the [[Hudson River]] in 1524.\n\nEngineer [[David B. Steinman]] proposed a bridge across the Narrows in the late 1920s, and subsequent proposals were deferred over the next 20 years. A 1920s attempt to build a [[Staten Island Tunnel|rail tunnel under the Narrows]] was aborted, as was another 1930s plan for vehicular tubes underneath the Narrows. Discussion of a tunnel resurfaced in the mid-1930s and early 1940s, but the plans were again denied. In the late 1940s, urban planner [[Robert Moses]] championed a bridge across the Narrows as a way to connect Staten Island with the rest of the city. Various issues delayed the start of construction until 1959. The bridge opened on November 21, 1964, and a lower deck was opened in June 1969 to alleviate high levels of traffic. The New York City government began a $1.5{{nbsp}}billion reconstruction of the bridge's two decks in 2014.\n\nThe Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge has a central span of {{convert|4260|ft|km mi|2}}. It was the [[List of longest suspension bridge spans|longest suspension bridge]] in the world until it was surpassed by the [[Humber Bridge]] in the United Kingdom in 1981. The bridge has the 14th-longest main span in the world, as well as the longest in America. When the bridge was officially named in 1960, it was misspelled \"Verrazano-Narrows Bridge\" due to an error in the construction contract, despite the explorer's name having two \"z\"s.<ref name=\"sim\" /> The name was officially corrected to \"Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge\" in October 2018.<ref name=\"Campanile 2018\"/>\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==History==\n\n=== Early plans ===\n\n==== Liberty Bridge ====\n[[File:The Narrows - panoramio.jpg|thumb|left|alt=View of the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge looking south from Upper New York Bay.

locally as the '''Verrazzano''', and formerly as the '''Verrazano-Narrows Bridge''' or '''Narrows Bridge''') is the longest [[suspension bridge]] in the Western Hemisphere, connecting the [[Boroughs of New York City|New York City boroughs]] of [[Staten Island]] and [[Brooklyn]]. It spans [[the Narrows]], a body of water linking the relatively enclosed [[Upper New York Bay]] with [[Lower New York Bay]] and the Atlantic Ocean, and is the only fixed crossing of the Narrows. The [[double-deck bridge]] carries 13 lanes of [[Interstate 278]], with seven lanes on the upper level and six on the lower level. The span is named for [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]], the first documented European explorer to enter [[New York Harbor]] and the [[Hudson River]] in 1524.\n\nEngineer [[David B. Steinman]] proposed a bridge across the Narrows in the late 1920s, and subsequent proposals were deferred over the next 20 years. A 1920s attempt to build a [[Staten Island Tunnel|rail tunnel under the Narrows]] was aborted, as was another 1930s plan for vehicular tubes underneath the Narrows. Discussion of a tunnel resurfaced in the mid-1930s and early 1940s, but the plans were again denied. In the late 1940s, urban planner [[Robert Moses]] championed a bridge across the Narrows as a way to connect Staten Island with the rest of the city. Various issues delayed the start of construction until 1959. The bridge opened on November 21, 1964, and a lower deck was opened in June 1969 to alleviate high levels of traffic. The New York City government began a $1.5{{nbsp}}billion reconstruction of the bridge's two decks in 2014.\n\nThe Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge has a central span of {{convert|4260|ft|km mi|2}}. It was the [[List of longest suspension bridge spans|longest suspension bridge]] in the world until it was surpassed by the [[Humber Bridge]] in the United Kingdom in 1981. The bridge has the 14th-longest main span in the world, as well as the longest in America. When the bridge was officially named in 1960, it was misspelled \"Verrazano-Narrows Bridge\" due to an error in the construction contract, despite the explorer's name having two \"z\"s.<ref name=\"sim\" /> The name was officially corrected to \"Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge\" in October 2018.<ref name=\"Campanile 2018\"/>\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==History==\n\n=== Early plans ===\n\n==== Liberty Bridge ====\n[[File:The Narrows - panoramio.jpg|thumb|left|alt=View of the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge looking south from Upper New York Bay.

After Robert Moses turned down the initial proposal, the society undertook a public relations campaign to re-establish Verrazzano's largely forgotten reputation and to promote the idea of naming the bridge for him. The society's director, John N. LaCorte, successfully lobbied several governors of states along the U.S.'s East Coast to proclaim April 17, the anniversary of Verrazzano's arrival in the harbor, as Verrazzano Day. LaCorte then approached the TBTA again, but was turned down a second time.

The Oriental Orthodox churches adhere to a [[Miaphysitism|Miaphysitic]] Christological view followed by [[Cyril of Alexandria]], the leading protagonist in the Christological debates of the 4th and 5th centuries, who advocated \"mia physis tou theou logou sesark\u014dmen\u0113\", or \"one (mia) nature of the Word of God incarnate\" (\u03bc\u03af\u03b1 \u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c3\u03b5\u03c3\u03b1\u03c1\u03ba\u03c9\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7)  and a \"union according to hypostasis\" (\u1f15\u03bd\u03c9\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b8' \u1f51\u03c0\u03cc\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd hen\u014dsis kath' hypostasin), or hypostatic union. The distinction of this stance was that the incarnate Christ has one nature, but that one nature is of the two natures, divine and human, and retains all the characteristics of both after the union.\n\nMiaphysitism holds that in the one person of [[Jesus Christ]], divinity and humanity are united in one (\u03bc\u03af\u03b1, ''mia'') nature (\u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 - \"[[physis]]\") without separation, without confusion, without alteration and without mixing<ref>''The Blackwell Companion to Eastern Christianity'' by Ken Parry 2009 {{ISBN|1-4443-3361-5}} page 88 [https://books.google.com/books?id=fWp9JA3aBvcC&pg=PA88&dq=Miaphysitism&hl=en&ei=sVDgTKqDKpDOswbundTyCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&sqi=2&ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Miaphysitism&f=false]</ref> where Christ is [[Consubstantiality|consubstantial]] with [[God the Father]].

This is in contrast to the \"two Natures of Christ\" belief (unmixed, but unseparated Divine and Human Natures, called the [[hypostatic union]]) which is held by the [[Catholic Church]] and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].\n\nOriental Orthodoxy is known as \"[[Non-Chalcedonianism|non-Chalcedonian]]\", and, sometimes by outsiders as \"[[monophysitism|monophysite]]\" (meaning \"One Single Nature\", in allusion to [[Jesus Christ]]).

([[Acts of the Apostles|''Acts'']], 8:26\u201327)}}\nThe passage continues by describing how Philip helped the Ethiopian treasurer understand a passage from the [[Book of Isaiah]] that the Ethiopian was reading. After Philip interpreted the passage as prophecy referring to [[Jesus Christ]], the Ethiopian requested that Philip baptize him, and Philip did so. The [[Ge'ez|Ethiopic]] version of this verse reads \"Hendeke\" (\u1205\u1295\u12f0\u12ac); Queen Gersamot Hendeke VII was the Queen of Ethiopia from c. 42 to 52. Where the possibility of gospel missions by the [[Ethiopian eunuch]] cannot be directly inferred from the Books of the New Testament, [[Irenaeus|Irenaeus of Lyons]] around 180 AD writes that \"Simon Backos\" preached the good news in his homeland outlining also the theme of his preaching as being the coming in flesh of God that \"was preached to you all before.\"<ref>Irenaeus of Lyons, \"Adversus haereses\" III. 12. 8</ref> The same kind of witness is shared by 3rd and 4th century writers such as [[Eusebius|Eusebius of Caesarea]]<ref>Eusebius Pamphilius, Church History</ref> and [[Origen|Origen of Alexandria]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n[[File:Ezana.jpg|thumb|Coin of King [[Ezana of Axum|Ezana]], under whom Early Christianity became the established church of the [[Kingdom of Aksum]]]]\nEarly Christianity became the [[established church]] of the Ethiopian [[Kingdom of Aksum|Axumite Kingdom]] under king [[Ezana of Axum|Ezana]] in the 4th century when priesthood and the sacraments were brought for the first time through a Syrian Greek named [[Frumentius]], known by the local population in Ethiopia as \"Selama, Kesat\u00e9 Birhan\" (\"Father of Peace, Revealer of Light\"). As a youth, Frumentius had been shipwrecked with his brother Aedesius on the [[Eritrea]]n coast. The brothers managed to be brought to the royal court, where they rose to positions of influence and baptized [[Ezana of Axum|Emperor Ezana]]. Frumentius is also believed to have established the first monastery in Ethiopia, named [[Degol Woyane|Dabba Selama]] after him.

Athanasius appointed Frumentius, who returned to Ethiopia as Bishop with the name of \"Selama\". From then on, until 1959, the Pope of Alexandria, as Patriarch of All Africa, always named an Egyptian (a [[Copt]]) to be ''[[Abuna]]'' or [[Archbishop]] of the Ethiopian Church.\n\n===Middle Ages===\n[[File:Giyorgis MET DP367372.jpg|thumb|Late 17th century portrait of [[Abba Giyorgis|Giyorgis]] by Baselyos]]\nUnion with the Coptic Orthodox Church continued after the Arab conquest of [[Egypt]]. Abu Saleh records in the 12th century that the patriarch always sent letters twice a year to the kings of Abyssinia (Ethiopia) and [[Nubia]], until Al Hakim stopped the practice.

These examples show the close relations of the two churches throughout the [[Middle Ages]].{{sfn|Butler|1911|p=95}}\n\nIn 1439, in the reign of [[Zara Yaqob]], a religious discussion between [[Abba Giyorgis|Giyorgis]] and a French visitor led to the dispatch of an embassy from Ethiopia to the [[Holy See|Vatican]].{{sfn|Butler|1911|p=95}}\n\n===Jesuit interim===\n[[File:Icon of Abuna Samuel of Waldebba.jpg|thumb|left|Icon of Abuna [[Samuel of Waldebba]], a 15th-century Ethiopian monk and ascetic of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church.]]\nThe period of [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] influence, which broke the connection with Egypt, began a new chapter in church history. The initiative in [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] missions to Ethiopia was taken, not by [[Rome]], but by [[Portugal]], in the course of a conflict with the [[Muslim]] [[Ottoman Empire]] and the [[Sultanate of Adal]] for the command of the trade route to [[India]] via the [[Red Sea]].{{sfn|Butler|1911|pp=95-96}}\n\nIn 1507 [[Mateus (Ethiopia)|Matthew]], or Matheus, an [[Armenians|Armenian]], had been sent as an Ethiopian envoy to Portugal to ask for aid against the [[Adal Sultanate]]. In 1520 an embassy under Dom Rodrigo de Lima landed in Ethiopia (by which time Adal had been remobilized under [[Ahmad ibn Ibrihim al-Ghazi]]). An interesting account of the Portuguese mission, which lasted for several years, was written by [[Francisco \u00c1lvares]], its chaplain.{{sfn|Butler|1911|p=96}}\n\nLater, [[Ignatius Loyola]] wished to take up the task of conversion, but was forbidden to do so. Instead, the [[pope]] sent out Jo\u00e3o Nunes Barreto as patriarch of the East Indies, with [[Andre de Oviedo]] as bishop; and from [[Goa]] envoys went to Ethiopia, followed by Oviedo himself, to secure the king's adherence to Rome. After repeated failures some measure of success was achieved under Emperor [[Susenyos I]], but not until 1624 did the Emperor make formal submission to the [[pope]].{{sfn|Butler|1911|p=96}} Susenyos made Roman Catholicism the official state religion, but was met with heavy resistance by his subjects and by the authorities of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, and eventually had to abdicate in 1632 in favour of his son, [[Fasilides]], who promptly restored Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity as the state religion. He then in 1633 expelled the Jesuits, and in 1665 Fasilides ordered that all Jesuit books (the Books of the Franks) be burned.\n\n===Influence on the Reformation===\nDavid Daniels has suggested that the Ethiopian church has had a stronger impact on the Reformation than most scholars acknowledge.

The 19th century witnessed the publication of an Amharic translation of the Bible. Largely the work of [[Abu Rumi]] over ten years in Cairo, this version, with some changes, held sway until Emperor [[Haile Selassie]] ordered a new translation which appeared in 1960/1.<ref>[[Edward Ullendorff]], ''Ethiopia and the Bible'' (Oxford: British Academy, 1988), p. 66</ref> Haile Selassie also played a prominent role in further reforms of the church, which included encouraging the distribution of Abu Rumi's translation throughout Ethiopia,<ref>Margary Perham, ''The Government of Ethiopia'', second edition (London: Faber and Faber, 1969), pp. 121f</ref> as well as his promotion of improved education of clergy, a significant step in the Emperor's effort being the founding of the Theological College of the Holy Trinity Church in December 1944.<ref>Perham, ''Government of Ethiopia'', p. 132</ref> A third development came after Haile Selassie's restoration to Ethiopia, when he issued, on 30 November, Decree Number 2 of 1942, a new law reforming the Church. The primary objectives of this decree were to put the finances of the church in order, to create a central fund for its activities, and to set forth requirements for the appointment of clergy \u2014 which had been fairly lax until then.<ref>Perham, ''Government of Ethiopia'', pp. 130</ref>\n\nThe Coptic and Ethiopian Churches reached an agreement on 13 July 1948, that led to [[autocephaly]] for the Ethiopian Church. Five [[bishop]]s were immediately consecrated by the Coptic Pope of Alexandria and Patriarch of All Africa, empowered to elect a new patriarch for their church, and the successor to Abuna Qerellos IV would have the power to consecrate new bishops.<ref>Discussed in fuller detail by Perham, ''Government of Ethiopia'', pp. 126\u2013130</ref> This promotion was completed when Coptic Orthodox [[Pope Joseph II of Alexandria|Pope Joseph II]] consecrated an Ethiopian-born Archbishop, [[Abuna Basilios]], 14 January 1951. Then in 1959, [[Pope Cyril VI of Alexandria]] crowned Abuna Basilios as the first Patriarch of Ethiopia.\n[[File:Display of Procesional Crosses, Church of Bet Maryam, Lalibela, Ethiopia (3230772118).jpg|thumb|left|An Ethiopian Orthodox priest displays the [[processional cross]]es.]]\nBasilios died in 1971, and was succeeded that year by [[Abune Tewophilos|Tewophilos]]. With the fall of Emperor Haile Selassie in 1974, the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church was disestablished as the [[state church]]. The new Marxist government began nationalizing property (including land) owned by the Church. Tewophilos was arrested in 1976 by the [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[Derg]] [[militarism|military]] [[military junta|junta]], and secretly executed in 1979. The government ordered the Church to elect a new Patriarch, and [[Abune Takla Haymanot|Takla Haymanot]] was enthroned. The Coptic Orthodox Church refused to recognize the election and enthronement of Tekle Haymanot on the grounds that the [[Synod]] of the Ethiopian Church had not removed Tewophilos and that the government had not publicly acknowledged his death, and he was thus still the legitimate Patriarch of Ethiopia. Formal relations between the two Churches were halted, although they remained in communion with each other. Formal relations between the two Churches resumed on July 13, 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.armenianorthodoxchurch.org/v04/doc/English/visitseng.htm#11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828004034/http://www.armenianorthodoxchurch.org/v04/doc/English/visitseng.htm#11|url-status=dead|archive-date=2008-08-28|title=\"Common Declaration\" of Pope Shenoudah III, Catholicos Aram I, and Patriarch Paulos \u2013 News and Media of the Armenian Orthodox Church, 22 July 2007}}</ref>\n\nTekle Haymanot proved to be much less accommodating to the Derg regime than it had expected, and so when the patriarch died in 1988, a new patriarch with closer ties to the regime was sought.

Following the fall of the Derg regime in 1991, and the coming to power of the [[Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front|EPRDF]] government, Merkorios abdicated under public and governmental pressure. The Church then elected a new Patriarch, [[Abune Paulos|Paulos]], who was recognized by the Coptic Orthodox Pope of Alexandria. The former Merkorios then fled abroad, and announced from exile that his abdication had been made under duress and thus he was still the legitimate Patriarch of Ethiopia.

It has been the liturgical language of the Church at least since the arrival of the [[Nine Saints]] (Pantelewon, Gerima (Isaac, or Yeshaq), Aftse, Guba, Alef, Yem\u2019ata, Liqanos, and Sehma), who fled persecution by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine Emperor]] after the [[Council of Chalcedon]] (451).{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} The [[Septuagint]] Greek version was originally translated into Ge'ez, but later revisions show clear evidence of the use of [[Hebrew]], [[Syriac language|Syriac]], and [[Arabic]] sources. The first translation into a modern vernacular was done in the 19th century by a man who is usually known as [[Abu Rumi]]. Later, Haile Selassie sponsored [[Amharic]] translations of the Ge'ez Scriptures during his reign, one before World War II and one afterward. [[Sermons]] today are usually delivered in the local language.\n\n===Architecture===\n[[File:Bet Giyorgis church Lalibela 01.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Church of Saint George, Lalibela|Church of Saint George]], a monolithic church in Lalibela]]\nThere are many [[monolithic church|monolithic (rock-hewn) church]]es in Ethiopia, most famously eleven churches at [[Lalibela]]. Besides these, two main types of architecture are found \u2014 one [[basilica]]n, the other native. The [[Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion]] at Axum is an example of the basilican design, though the early basilicas are nearly all in ruin. These examples show the influence of the architects who, in the 6th century, built the basilicas at [[Sana\u00e1|San\u02bb\u0101\u02bc]] and elsewhere in the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. There are two forms of native churches: one oblong, traditionally found in [[Tigray Region|Tigray]]; the other circular, traditionally found in [[Amhara Region|Amhara]] and [[Shewa]] (though either style may be found elsewhere). In both forms, the sanctuary is square and stands clear in the center, and the arrangements are based on [[Judaism|Jewish]] tradition. Walls and ceilings are adorned with [[fresco]]es. A [[courtyard]], circular or rectangular, surrounds the body of the church. Modern Ethiopian churches may incorporate the basilican or native styles and use contemporary construction techniques and materials. In rural areas, the church and outer court are often [[Thatching|thatched]], with mud-built walls.  The church buildings are typically surrounded by a forested area, acting as a reservoir of biodiversity in otherwise de-forested parts of the country.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Abbott |first1=Alison |title=Biodiversity thrives in Ethiopia's church forests |url=https://www.nature.com/immersive/d41586-019-00275-x/index.html |accessdate=31 January 2019 |work=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]}}</ref>{{sfn|Butler|1911|p=96}}\n\n===Ark of the Covenant===\n[[File:Ark of the Covenant church in Axum Ethiopia.jpg|thumb|The Chapel of the Tablet at the [[Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion]] is said to house the original [[Ark of the Covenant]].]]\nThe Ethiopian church claims that one of its churches, [[Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion|Our Lady Mary of Zion]], is host to the original [[Ark of the Covenant]] that [[Moses]] carried with the [[Israelites]] during the [[The Exodus|Exodus]]. Only one priest is allowed into the building where the Ark is located, ostensibly due to dangerous biblical warnings. As a result, international scholars doubt that the original Ark is truly there, although a case has been put forward by controversial popular writer [[Graham Hancock]] in his book ''[[The Sign and the Seal]]''.\n\nThroughout Ethiopia, Orthodox churches are not considered churches until the local bishop gives them a ''[[tabot]]'', a replica of the tablets in the original Ark of the Covenant. The ''tabot'' is at least six inches (15&nbsp;cm) square, and it is made of either [[alabaster]], [[marble]], or wood (see [[acacia]]). It is always kept in ornate coverings on the altar. Only priests are allowed to touch the ''tabot''. In an elaborate procession, the ''tabot'' is carried around the outside of the church amid joyful song on the feast day of that particular church's namesake. On the great Feast of [[Timkat|T'imk'et]], known as [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] or Theophany in Europe, a group of churches send their ''tabot'' to celebrate the occasion at a common location where a pool of water or a river is to be found.\n\n===Similarities to Judaism and Islam===\n[[File:The Ethiopian Church.jpg|thumb| [[Kidane Mehret Church, Jerusalem|The Ethiopian Church, Jerusalem]]]]\nThe Ethiopian church places a heavier emphasis on Old Testament teachings than one might find in [[Eastern Orthodox Church| Eastern Orthodox]], Roman Catholic or [[Protestantism |Protestant]] churches, and its followers adhere to certain practices that one finds in [[Orthodox Judaism| Orthodox]] or [[Conservative Judaism| Conservative]] [[Judaism]]. Ethiopian Christians, like some other [[Eastern Christianity |Eastern Christians]], traditionally follow dietary rules that are similar to Jewish [[Kashrut]], specifically with regard to the slaughter of animals. Similarly, pork is prohibited, though unlike [[Rabbinical Judaism| Rabbinical]] Kashrut, [[Ethiopian cuisine]] does mix [[Milk and meat in Jewish law| dairy products with meat]], which in turn makes it even closer to [[Karaite Judaism| Karaite]] and [[Islamic dietary laws]] (see [[Halal]]). Women are prohibited from entering the church temple during [[menses]]; they are also expected to cover their hair with a large scarf (or ''shash'') while in church, as described in 1 Corinthians, chapter 11. As with Orthodox [[synagogue]]s, men and women sit separately in the Ethiopian church, with men on the left and women on the right (when facing the altar).<ref name=\"Hable1997\">{{cite book|last= Hable Selassie|first= Sergew|title= The Church of Ethiopia \u2013 A panorama of History and Spiritual Life|year= 1997|publisher= Berhanena Selam|location= Addis Abeba, Ethiopia|page= 66}}</ref> (Women covering their heads and separation of the sexes in churches officially is common to some other Christian traditions; it is also the rule in some non-Christian religions, [[Islam]] and [[Orthodox Judaism]] among them).

Ethiopia is the second country historically, following only [[Armenia]], to have officially proclaimed Christianity as its state religion (in AD 333).\n\n''Tewahedo'' ([[Ge'ez alphabet|Ge'ez]] \u1270\u12cb\u1215\u12f6) is a [[Ge'ez language|Ge'ez]] word meaning \"united as one\". This word refers to the Oriental Orthodox belief in the [[Miaphysitism|one perfectly unified nature of Christ]]; i.e., a complete union of the divine and human natures into one nature is self-evident in order to accomplish the divine salvation of humankind, as opposed to the \"[[two natures of Christ]]\" belief commonly held by the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Anglicanism|Anglican]], [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] and most [[List of the largest Protestant denominations|Protestant churches]]. The Oriental Orthodox churches adhere to a [[Miaphysitism|Miaphysitic]] Christological view followed by [[Cyril of Alexandria]], the leading protagonist in the Christological debates of the 4th and 5th centuries, who advocated \"mia physis tou theou logou sesark\u014dmen\u0113\", or \"one (mia) nature of the Word of God incarnate\" (\u03bc\u03af\u03b1 \u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c3\u03b5\u03c3\u03b1\u03c1\u03ba\u03c9\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7)  and a \"union according to hypostasis\" (\u1f15\u03bd\u03c9\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b8' \u1f51\u03c0\u03cc\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd hen\u014dsis kath' hypostasin), or hypostatic union. The distinction of this stance was that the incarnate Christ has one nature, but that one nature is of the two natures, divine and human, and retains all the characteristics of both after the union.\n\nMiaphysitism holds that in the one person of [[Jesus Christ]], divinity and humanity are united in one (\u03bc\u03af\u03b1, ''mia'') nature (\u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 - \"[[physis]]\") without separation, without confusion, without alteration and without mixing<ref>''The Blackwell Companion to Eastern Christianity'' by Ken Parry 2009 {{ISBN|1-4443-3361-5}} page 88 [https://books.google.com/books?id=fWp9JA3aBvcC&pg=PA88&dq=Miaphysitism&hl=en&ei=sVDgTKqDKpDOswbundTyCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&sqi=2&ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Miaphysitism&f=false]</ref> where Christ is [[Consubstantiality|consubstantial]] with [[God the Father]]. Around 500 bishops within the Patriarchates of [[Alexandria]], [[Antioch]] and [[Jerusalem]] refused to accept the [[dyophysitism]] (two natures) doctrine decreed by the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451, an incident that resulted in the first major split in the main body of the Christian Church.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07218b.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Henoticon |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1910-06-01 |accessdate=2013-06-30}}</ref>\n\n==Name==\n''Tewahedo'' ({{lang-gez|\u1270\u12cb\u1215\u12f6}} ''t\u00e4wa\u1e25\u0259do'') is a Ge'ez word meaning \"being made one\" or \"unified\". This word refers to the [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]] belief in the one single unified [[Christology|nature of Christ]]; i.e., a belief that a complete, natural union of the Divine and Human Natures into One is self-evident in order to accomplish the divine salvation of humankind. This is in contrast to the \"two Natures of Christ\" belief (unmixed, but unseparated Divine and Human Natures, called the [[hypostatic union]]) which is held by the [[Catholic Church]] and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].\n\nOriental Orthodoxy is known as \"[[Non-Chalcedonianism|non-Chalcedonian]]\", and, sometimes by outsiders as \"[[monophysitism|monophysite]]\" (meaning \"One Single Nature\", in allusion to [[Jesus Christ]]). However, these Churches themselves describe their Christology as [[miaphysitism|miaphysite]] (meaning \"one united nature\" in reference to Jesus, the Greek equivalent of \"Tewahedo\").\n\n==History==\n===Origins===\n[[File:Icon - FrontLeft - Small.jpg|thumb|Ethiopian Orthodox icon depicting [[Saint George|St. George]], the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]], and the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]]]]\nMany traditions claim that [[Christianity|Christian]] teachings were introduced to the region immediately after [[Pentecost]].

EOTC Publication Committee September, 2015</ref>\n\nThe earliest account of an Ethiopian converted to the faith in the [[New Testament]] books is [[Ethiopian eunuch|a royal official]] baptized by [[Philip the Evangelist]] (distinct from [[Philip the Apostle]]), one of the [[seven deacons]] ([[Acts of the Apostles|''Acts'']], 8:26\u201327):\n\n{{Quote|Then the angel of the Lord said to Philip, Start out and go south to the road that leads down from Jerusalem to Gaza. So he set out and was on his way when he caught sight of an [[Ethiopian eunuch|Ethiopian]]. This man was a eunuch, a high official of the [[Kandake]] (Candace) Queen of Ethiopia in charge of all her treasure. ([[Acts of the Apostles|''Acts'']], 8:26\u201327)}}\nThe passage continues by describing how Philip helped the Ethiopian treasurer understand a passage from the [[Book of Isaiah]] that the Ethiopian was reading. After Philip interpreted the passage as prophecy referring to [[Jesus Christ]], the Ethiopian requested that Philip baptize him, and Philip did so. The [[Ge'ez|Ethiopic]] version of this verse reads \"Hendeke\" (\u1205\u1295\u12f0\u12ac); Queen Gersamot Hendeke VII was the Queen of Ethiopia from c. 42 to 52. Where the possibility of gospel missions by the [[Ethiopian eunuch]] cannot be directly inferred from the Books of the New Testament, [[Irenaeus|Irenaeus of Lyons]] around 180 AD writes that \"Simon Backos\" preached the good news in his homeland outlining also the theme of his preaching as being the coming in flesh of God that \"was preached to you all before.\"<ref>Irenaeus of Lyons, \"Adversus haereses\" III. 12. 8</ref> The same kind of witness is shared by 3rd and 4th century writers such as [[Eusebius|Eusebius of Caesarea]]<ref>Eusebius Pamphilius, Church History</ref> and [[Origen|Origen of Alexandria]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n[[File:Ezana.jpg|thumb|Coin of King [[Ezana of Axum|Ezana]], under whom Early Christianity became the established church of the [[Kingdom of Aksum]]]]\nEarly Christianity became the [[established church]] of the Ethiopian [[Kingdom of Aksum|Axumite Kingdom]] under king [[Ezana of Axum|Ezana]] in the 4th century when priesthood and the sacraments were brought for the first time through a Syrian Greek named [[Frumentius]], known by the local population in Ethiopia as \"Selama, Kesat\u00e9 Birhan\" (\"Father of Peace, Revealer of Light\"). As a youth, Frumentius had been shipwrecked with his brother Aedesius on the [[Eritrea]]n coast. The brothers managed to be brought to the royal court, where they rose to positions of influence and baptized [[Ezana of Axum|Emperor Ezana]]. Frumentius is also believed to have established the first monastery in Ethiopia, named [[Degol Woyane|Dabba Selama]] after him.  In 2016, scientists excavated a 4th-century AD basilica (radio-carbon dated) in northeastern Ethiopia at a site called Beta Samati.

Athanasius appointed Frumentius, who returned to Ethiopia as Bishop with the name of \"Selama\". From then on, until 1959, the Pope of Alexandria, as Patriarch of All Africa, always named an Egyptian (a [[Copt]]) to be ''[[Abuna]]'' or [[Archbishop]] of the Ethiopian Church.\n\n===Middle Ages===\n[[File:Giyorgis MET DP367372.jpg|thumb|Late 17th century portrait of [[Abba Giyorgis|Giyorgis]] by Baselyos]]\nUnion with the Coptic Orthodox Church continued after the Arab conquest of [[Egypt]]. Abu Saleh records in the 12th century that the patriarch always sent letters twice a year to the kings of Abyssinia (Ethiopia) and [[Nubia]], until Al Hakim stopped the practice. Cyril, 67th patriarch, sent Severus as bishop, with orders to put down [[polygamy]] and to enforce observance of canonical consecration for all churches. These examples show the close relations of the two churches throughout the [[Middle Ages]].{{sfn|Butler|1911|p=95}}\n\nIn 1439, in the reign of [[Zara Yaqob]], a religious discussion between [[Abba Giyorgis|Giyorgis]] and a French visitor led to the dispatch of an embassy from Ethiopia to the [[Holy See|Vatican]].{{sfn|Butler|1911|p=95}}\n\n===Jesuit interim===\n[[File:Icon of Abuna Samuel of Waldebba.jpg|thumb|left|Icon of Abuna [[Samuel of Waldebba]], a 15th-century Ethiopian monk and ascetic of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church.]]\nThe period of [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] influence, which broke the connection with Egypt, began a new chapter in church history. The initiative in [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] missions to Ethiopia was taken, not by [[Rome]], but by [[Portugal]], in the course of a conflict with the [[Muslim]] [[Ottoman Empire]] and the [[Sultanate of Adal]] for the command of the trade route to [[India]] via the [[Red Sea]].{{sfn|Butler|1911|pp=95-96}}\n\nIn 1507 [[Mateus (Ethiopia)|Matthew]], or Matheus, an [[Armenians|Armenian]], had been sent as an Ethiopian envoy to Portugal to ask for aid against the [[Adal Sultanate]]. In 1520 an embassy under Dom Rodrigo de Lima landed in Ethiopia (by which time Adal had been remobilized under [[Ahmad ibn Ibrihim al-Ghazi]]). An interesting account of the Portuguese mission, which lasted for several years, was written by [[Francisco \u00c1lvares]], its chaplain.{{sfn|Butler|1911|p=96}}\n\nLater, [[Ignatius Loyola]] wished to take up the task of conversion, but was forbidden to do so. Instead, the [[pope]] sent out Jo\u00e3o Nunes Barreto as patriarch of the East Indies, with [[Andre de Oviedo]] as bishop; and from [[Goa]] envoys went to Ethiopia, followed by Oviedo himself, to secure the king's adherence to Rome. After repeated failures some measure of success was achieved under Emperor [[Susenyos I]], but not until 1624 did the Emperor make formal submission to the [[pope]].{{sfn|Butler|1911|p=96}} Susenyos made Roman Catholicism the official state religion, but was met with heavy resistance by his subjects and by the authorities of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, and eventually had to abdicate in 1632 in favour of his son, [[Fasilides]], who promptly restored Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity as the state religion. He then in 1633 expelled the Jesuits, and in 1665 Fasilides ordered that all Jesuit books (the Books of the Franks) be burned.\n\n===Influence on the Reformation===\nDavid Daniels has suggested that the Ethiopian church has had a stronger impact on the Reformation than most scholars acknowledge. For [[Martin Luther]], who spearheaded the [[Reformation]], Daniels says \"the Ethiopian Church conferred legitimacy on Luther's emerging Protestant vision of a church outside the authority of the Roman Catholic papacy\" as it was \"an ancient church with direct ties to the apostles\".<ref name=\"Daniels2017\">{{cite web|url=https://www.commercialappeal.com/story/opinion/contributors/2017/10/21/honor-reformations-african-roots/783252001/|title=Honor the Reformation's African roots|last=Daniels|first=David D.|date=21 October 2017|publisher=[[The Commercial Appeal]]|language=English|accessdate=9 April 2018}}</ref> According to Daniels, Martin Luther saw that the Ethiopian Orthodox Church practiced elements of faith including \"[[communion under both kinds|communion in both kind]], vernacular Scriptures, and married clergy\" and these practices became customary in the [[Lutheran Church|Lutheran church]]es.<ref name=\"Daniels2017\"/>\n\nIn 1534, a cleric of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, [[Michael the Deacon]], met with Martin Luther and affirmed the [[Augsburg Confession]] as a \"good creed\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://divinity.uchicago.edu/sightings/martin-luther-and-ethiopian-christianity-historical-traces|title=Martin Luther and Ethiopian Christianity: Historical Traces|last=Daniels|first=David D.|date=2 November 2017|publisher=[[University of Chicago]]|language=English|accessdate=9 April 2018|quote=Luther expressed his approval of the Church of Ethiopia along with his embrace of Deacon Michael in a letter dated July 4, 1534: \"For this reason we ask that good people would demonstrate Christian love also to this [Ethiopian] visitor.\" According to Luther, Michael responded positively to his articles of the Christian faith, proclaiming: \"This is a good creed, that is, faith\" (see Martin Luther, Table-Talk, November 17, 1538 [WA, TR 4:152-153, no. 4126]).}}</ref><ref name=\"Daniels2017\"/> In addition, Martin Luther stated that the [[Divine Service (Lutheran)|Lutheran Mass]] agreed with that used by the Ethiopian Orthodox Church.<ref name=\"Daniels2017\"/> As a result, the Lutheran Churches extended full communion with the Ethiopian Orthodox Church.<ref name=\"Daniels2017\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.christiancentury.org/blog-post/guest-post/martin-luthers-fascination-ethiopian-christianity|title=Martin Luther's fascination with Ethiopian Christianity|last=Daniels|first=David D.|date=31 October 2017|publisher=[[The Christian Century]]|language=English|accessdate=9 April 2018|quote=Luther extended full fellowship to Deacon Michael and the Ethiopian Church, an invitation Luther withheld from the Bohemian Brethren (the Hussites) and Reformed Churches connected to Ulrich Zwingli.}}</ref>\n\n===Recent history===\n[[File:Salama III.jpg|thumb|Engraving of [[Abuna Salama III]], head of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church (1841-1867)]]\nIn more modern times, the Ethiopian church has experienced a series of developments. The 19th century witnessed the publication of an Amharic translation of the Bible. Largely the work of [[Abu Rumi]] over ten years in Cairo, this version, with some changes, held sway until Emperor [[Haile Selassie]] ordered a new translation which appeared in 1960/1.<ref>[[Edward Ullendorff]], ''Ethiopia and the Bible'' (Oxford: British Academy, 1988), p. 66</ref> Haile Selassie also played a prominent role in further reforms of the church, which included encouraging the distribution of Abu Rumi's translation throughout Ethiopia,<ref>Margary Perham, ''The Government of Ethiopia'', second edition (London: Faber and Faber, 1969), pp. 121f</ref> as well as his promotion of improved education of clergy, a significant step in the Emperor's effort being the founding of the Theological College of the Holy Trinity Church in December 1944.<ref>Perham, ''Government of Ethiopia'', p. 132</ref> A third development came after Haile Selassie's restoration to Ethiopia, when he issued, on 30 November, Decree Number 2 of 1942, a new law reforming the Church. The primary objectives of this decree were to put the finances of the church in order, to create a central fund for its activities, and to set forth requirements for the appointment of clergy \u2014 which had been fairly lax until then.<ref>Perham, ''Government of Ethiopia'', pp. 130</ref>\n\nThe Coptic and Ethiopian Churches reached an agreement on 13 July 1948, that led to [[autocephaly]] for the Ethiopian Church. Five [[bishop]]s were immediately consecrated by the Coptic Pope of Alexandria and Patriarch of All Africa, empowered to elect a new patriarch for their church, and the successor to Abuna Qerellos IV would have the power to consecrate new bishops.<ref>Discussed in fuller detail by Perham, ''Government of Ethiopia'', pp. 126\u2013130</ref> This promotion was completed when Coptic Orthodox [[Pope Joseph II of Alexandria|Pope Joseph II]] consecrated an Ethiopian-born Archbishop, [[Abuna Basilios]], 14 January 1951. Then in 1959, [[Pope Cyril VI of Alexandria]] crowned Abuna Basilios as the first Patriarch of Ethiopia.\n[[File:Display of Procesional Crosses, Church of Bet Maryam, Lalibela, Ethiopia (3230772118).jpg|thumb|left|An Ethiopian Orthodox priest displays the [[processional cross]]es.]]\nBasilios died in 1971, and was succeeded that year by [[Abune Tewophilos|Tewophilos]]. With the fall of Emperor Haile Selassie in 1974, the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church was disestablished as the [[state church]]. The new Marxist government began nationalizing property (including land) owned by the Church. Tewophilos was arrested in 1976 by the [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[Derg]] [[militarism|military]] [[military junta|junta]], and secretly executed in 1979. The government ordered the Church to elect a new Patriarch, and [[Abune Takla Haymanot|Takla Haymanot]] was enthroned. The Coptic Orthodox Church refused to recognize the election and enthronement of Tekle Haymanot on the grounds that the [[Synod]] of the Ethiopian Church had not removed Tewophilos and that the government had not publicly acknowledged his death, and he was thus still the legitimate Patriarch of Ethiopia.

The Church then elected a new Patriarch, [[Abune Paulos|Paulos]], who was recognized by the Coptic Orthodox Pope of Alexandria. The former Merkorios then fled abroad, and announced from exile that his abdication had been made under duress and thus he was still the legitimate Patriarch of Ethiopia.

Later, Haile Selassie sponsored [[Amharic]] translations of the Ge'ez Scriptures during his reign, one before World War II and one afterward.

Besides these, two main types of architecture are found \u2014 one [[basilica]]n, the other native. The [[Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion]] at Axum is an example of the basilican design, though the early basilicas are nearly all in ruin. These examples show the influence of the architects who, in the 6th century, built the basilicas at [[Sana\u00e1|San\u02bb\u0101\u02bc]] and elsewhere in the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. There are two forms of native churches: one oblong, traditionally found in [[Tigray Region|Tigray]]; the other circular, traditionally found in [[Amhara Region|Amhara]] and [[Shewa]] (though either style may be found elsewhere). In both forms, the sanctuary is square and stands clear in the center, and the arrangements are based on [[Judaism|Jewish]] tradition. Walls and ceilings are adorned with [[fresco]]es. A [[courtyard]], circular or rectangular, surrounds the body of the church. Modern Ethiopian churches may incorporate the basilican or native styles and use contemporary construction techniques and materials. In rural areas, the church and outer court are often [[Thatching|thatched]], with mud-built walls.

Only one priest is allowed into the building where the Ark is located, ostensibly due to dangerous biblical warnings. As a result, international scholars doubt that the original Ark is truly there, although a case has been put forward by controversial popular writer [[Graham Hancock]] in his book ''[[The Sign and the Seal]]''.\n\nThroughout Ethiopia, Orthodox churches are not considered churches until the local bishop gives them a ''[[tabot]]'', a replica of the tablets in the original Ark of the Covenant. The ''tabot'' is at least six inches (15&nbsp;cm) square, and it is made of either [[alabaster]], [[marble]], or wood (see [[acacia]]). It is always kept in ornate coverings on the altar. Only priests are allowed to touch the ''tabot''. In an elaborate procession, the ''tabot'' is carried around the outside of the church amid joyful song on the feast day of that particular church's namesake. On the great Feast of [[Timkat|T'imk'et]], known as [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] or Theophany in Europe, a group of churches send their ''tabot'' to celebrate the occasion at a common location where a pool of water or a river is to be found.\n\n===Similarities to Judaism and Islam===\n[[File:The Ethiopian Church.jpg|thumb| [[Kidane Mehret Church, Jerusalem|The Ethiopian Church, Jerusalem]]]]\nThe Ethiopian church places a heavier emphasis on Old Testament teachings than one might find in [[Eastern Orthodox Church| Eastern Orthodox]], Roman Catholic or [[Protestantism |Protestant]] churches, and its followers adhere to certain practices that one finds in [[Orthodox Judaism| Orthodox]] or [[Conservative Judaism| Conservative]] [[Judaism]]. Ethiopian Christians, like some other [[Eastern Christianity |Eastern Christians]], traditionally follow dietary rules that are similar to Jewish [[Kashrut]], specifically with regard to the slaughter of animals. Similarly, pork is prohibited, though unlike [[Rabbinical Judaism| Rabbinical]] Kashrut, [[Ethiopian cuisine]] does mix [[Milk and meat in Jewish law| dairy products with meat]], which in turn makes it even closer to [[Karaite Judaism| Karaite]] and [[Islamic dietary laws]] (see [[Halal]]). Women are prohibited from entering the church temple during [[menses]]; they are also expected to cover their hair with a large scarf (or ''shash'') while in church, as described in 1 Corinthians, chapter 11.

Among the conclusions of the test was the lack of certain medical supplies to meet demand due to their needing to be imported.

The design, intended to solve the problem of stockpile waste and decay, was completed in 2018. Halyard requested funding to build a prototype, but this was not granted.\n\nA second BARDA contract was signed with Applied Research Associates of Albuquerque, to design an N95-rated mask that could be reused in emergencies without reduced effectiveness. Though federal reports had called for such a project since 2006, the ARA contract wasn't signed until 2017, and missed its 15-month completion deadline, resulting in the 2020 pandemic reaching the United States before the design was ready.<ref name=\"wp-masks\" />\n\nPrevious respiratory epidemics and government planning indicated a need for a stockpile of ventilators that were easier for less-trained medical personnel to use. BARDA Project Aura issued a [[request for proposals]] in 2008, with a goal of FDA approval in 2010 or 2011. A contract for the production of up to 40,000 ventilators was awarded to Newport Medical Instruments, a small ventilator manufacturer, with a target price of $3,000, much lower than more complicated machines costing more than $10,000, and it produced prototypes with target FDA approval in 2013. [[Covidien]] purchased NMI and after for more money to complete the project (bringing the total cost to around $8 million) asked the government to cancel the contract, saying it wasn't profitable. The government awarded a new $13.8 million contract to [[Philips]], in 2014. The design for the Trilogy Evo Universal gained FDA approval in July 2019. The government ordered 10,000 ventilators in September 2019, with a mid-2020 deadline for the first deliveries and a deadline of 2022 to complete all 10,000. Despite the start of the epidemic in December, the capacity of the company to have produced enough to fill the full order, and the ability of the government to force faster production, the government did not reach an agreement with Philips for accelerated delivery until March 10, 2020.<ref name=\"nyt-vent\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/business/coronavirus-us-ventilator-shortage.html|title=The U.S. Tried to Build a New Fleet of Ventilators.

Retrieved March 23, 2020</ref>\n\n===Containment and mitigation===\n\n{{See also|Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19}}\n\nThe early phases of public health efforts for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/ \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations such as the CDC focus on both containment, to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic attempts to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''The Plain Dealer'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment. COVID-19, at the other extreme, is a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nThe WHO on January 30 warned that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, [[contact tracing]] and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Merrit |title=WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/30/798894428/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |publisher=NPR |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.<ref>Marisa Taylor ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21910S Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak]'' March 22, 2020 Reuters.com</ref>\n\nAt a White House press briefing on April 1, [[Anthony Fauci|Dr. Anthony S.

The plot below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all four y axes on one plot to show relationships between the trends. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten.

The design, intended to solve the problem of stockpile waste and decay, was completed in 2018. Halyard requested funding to build a prototype, but this was not granted.\n\nA second BARDA contract was signed with Applied Research Associates of Albuquerque, to design an N95-rated mask that could be reused in emergencies without reduced effectiveness. Though federal reports had called for such a project since 2006, the ARA contract wasn't signed until 2017, and missed its 15-month completion deadline, resulting in the 2020 pandemic reaching the United States before the design was ready.<ref name=\"wp-masks\" />\n\nPrevious respiratory epidemics and government planning indicated a need for a stockpile of ventilators that were easier for less-trained medical personnel to use. BARDA Project Aura issued a [[request for proposals]] in 2008, with a goal of FDA approval in 2010 or 2011. A contract for the production of up to 40,000 ventilators was awarded to Newport Medical Instruments, a small ventilator manufacturer, with a target price of $3,000, much lower than more complicated machines costing more than $10,000, and it produced prototypes with target FDA approval in 2013. [[Covidien]] purchased NMI and after for more money to complete the project (bringing the total cost to around $8 million) asked the government to cancel the contract, saying it wasn't profitable. The government awarded a new $13.8 million contract to [[Philips]], in 2014. The design for the Trilogy Evo Universal gained FDA approval in July 2019. The government ordered 10,000 ventilators in September 2019, with a mid-2020 deadline for the first deliveries and a deadline of 2022 to complete all 10,000. Despite the start of the epidemic in December, the capacity of the company to have produced enough to fill the full order, and the ability of the government to force faster production, the government did not reach an agreement with Philips for accelerated delivery until March 10, 2020.<ref name=\"nyt-vent\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/business/coronavirus-us-ventilator-shortage.html|title=The U.S. Tried to Build a New Fleet of Ventilators.

Retrieved March 23, 2020</ref>\n\n===Containment and mitigation===\n\n{{See also|Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19}}\n\nThe early phases of public health efforts for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/ \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations such as the CDC focus on both containment, to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic attempts to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''The Plain Dealer'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment. COVID-19, at the other extreme, is a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nThe WHO on January 30 warned that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, [[contact tracing]] and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Merrit |title=WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/30/798894428/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |publisher=NPR |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.<ref>Marisa Taylor ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21910S Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak]'' March 22, 2020 Reuters.com</ref>\n\nAt a White House press briefing on April 1, [[Anthony Fauci|Dr. Anthony S.

The plot below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all four y axes on one plot to show relationships between the trends. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten. This makes the slope of the plot the relative rate of change anywhere in the timeline, which allows comparison of one plot with the others throughout the pandemic.<!--One option in the Graph:Chart template, \"yScaleType=log\" makes this happen; this option was added for this article and is not yet documented in the template.
