''O. umbellatum'' is a relatively short plant, occurring in tufts of basal linear leaves, producing conspicuous white flowers, in a stellate pattern, in mid to late spring. The flowers open late in the day (hence some of its common names), but when closed have a green stripe on the outside. It is [[native species|native]] throughout most of southern and central [[Europe]], and north-western [[Africa]]. ''O. umbellatum'' is often grown as a [[garden ornamental]], but in [[North America]] and other areas it has escaped cultivation and can be found in many areas, where it may become an [[Invasive species|invasive]] noxious weed. Parts of the plant are considered poisonous, but are used in some regional cuisines. [[Essential oil|Essences]] are also sold as [[patent remedies]]. ''O. umbellatum'' has been depicted in art by artists such as Leonardo da Vinci, and [[folklore]] has suggested it originally grew from fragments of the [[star of Bethlehem]], hence its horticultural name.\n\n==Description==\n''O. umbellatum'' is a [[Perennial plant|perennial]] [[herbaceous]] [[bulbous]] plant ([[geophyte]]), dying back after flowering, to  an underground storage bulb. The following year, it regrows from the often shallow rooted bulbs, which are [[ovoid]] with a membranous coat,{{sfn |IPANE |2019}} {{convert|15|-|25|mm|1}} long and {{convert|18|-|32|mm|1|abbr=on}} in diameter. The bulbs form multiple leaf-bearing bulbils that soon separate but remain close by.{{sfn |Gadella |1972}} Initially the plant forms 6\u201310 basal [[leaf|leaves]], that arise in tufts from the bulbs. The leaves are grooved ([[Glossary of botanical terms#canaliculate|canaliculate]]), smooth ([[glabrousness (botany)|glabrous]]) and linear with a white to light green linear midrib on the upper surface, and grow up to {{convert|30|cm}} long and {{convert|8|mm|1|abbr=on}} broad.{{sfn |Tutin et al |1980}}\n\n''O. umbellatum'' is [[scapose]], with a glabrous flower stem ([[Scape (botany)|scape]]) that emerges from the leaf tufts later and is about {{convert|10|-|30|cm|0|abbr=on}} in height, tapering at its tip.{{sfn |IPANE |2019}} \n{{multiple image | header = Plant Morphology| align = center | direction = horizontal | total_width= 600 | float = none \n|image1 =Ornithogalum umbellatum bulb.jpg|caption1=Bulb with bulbil|alt1=Bulb with associated bulbil\n|image2 =Ornithogalum umbellatum plant.jpg|caption2=Ornithogalum plant|alt2=Entire plant after digging up\n|image3 =Ornithogalum umbellatum (Dame de onze heures) 01.JPG|caption3= Clump of scapes with closed flowers arising from basal leaves|alt3=Scapes arising from tuft of leaves \n}}\nThe [[inflorescence]] bears 6\u201320 flat star shaped flowers on ascending stems ([[pedicels]]) ({{convert|3|-|3.5|cm|abbr=on}}) associated with membranaceous leaflets ([[bracts]]) ({{convert|2.5|-|3|cm|abbr=on}}) in an open branching umbrella ([[umbel]]) shaped terminal cluster, described as a [[Panicle|corymbose]] [[raceme]].{{sfn |Gadella |1972}} The petal-like [[perianth]] is radially symmetric ([[actinomorphic]]), which is {{convert|1.5|-|2|cm|1}} in diameter, consists of six [[lanceolate]] [[tepals]] which are white with a green stripe on the underside (outside), {{convert|15|mm|abbr=on}} in length and {{convert|5|mm|abbr=on}} wide. From the outside the closed flower appears green with white margins.{{sfn |IPANE |2019}}\n\nThe reproductive parts consist of both male ([[androecium]]) and female ([[gynoecium]]) parts ([[Hermaphrodite (botany)|hermaphrodite]]). The androecium has six yellow-brown [[stamens]] that are free of the perianth and form two groups, each of about {{convert|5|-|8|mm|1}}, with filaments that are simple and flattened and oblong anthers that are {{convert|2|-|4|mm|}}. The gynoecium has a single pistil with a superior (i. e. above the floral parts) [[Ovary (botany)|ovary]] that is ovoid to obovoid, {{convert|3|-|4|mm|1}}, and longer than the [[Style (botany)|style]] that extends above it. The [[fruit]] is a [[capsule (fruit)|capsule]] which is oblong-ovoid with 3 sides and 6 ribs. Within it, each [[locule]] contains many seeds with a black coat of [[phytomelan]] (''see [[Floral diagram]]'').{{sfn |Blamey |Grey-Wilson |1989}}{{sfn |Jordan |2000}} The species is [[polyploid]] (having more than two sets of [[chromosomes]]).{{sfn |FNA |2003}}\n{{multiple image | header = Floral Morphology| align = center | direction = horizontal | total_width= 600 | float = none \n|image1 =Ornithogalum umbellatum inflorescence.jpg|caption1=Inflorescence, pedicels & bracts|alt1=Arrangement of floers in inflorescence\n|image2 =Ornithogalum umbellatum 12.JPG| caption2 = Underside of tepals|alt2=Underside of tepals\n|image3 =Ornithogalum umbellatum 003.JPG|caption3= Detail of flower from above|alt3=Flower seen from above, close up \n|image4 =Ornithogalum umbellatum1.jpg|caption4= Flower from side|alt4= Side view of flower\n|image5 =Ornithogalum umbellatum lateral.jpg|caption5=Detail of structures|alt5=Lateral view of reproductive organs\n|image6 =ORNITHOGALUM UMBELLATUM - TOR\u00c0 - IB-915 (Llet de gallina).JPG|caption6= Capsules on scapes|alt6= Capsules on scapes, following pollination\n}}\n\n==Taxonomy==\n{{multiple image | header = | align = center | direction = horizontal | total_width= 250 | float = none \n|image1 =Star of Bethlem.png|caption1=Illustration by [[John Gerard]]<br>1597|alt1=John Gerard's illustration\n|image2 =Ornithogalum.png|caption2=Description by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]]<br>1753|alt2=page from Linnaeus' Species Plantarum, describing Ornithogalum umbellatum\n}}\n''Ornithogalum umbellatum'' has been known and described for a long time, according to some authors, as far back as [[Dioscorides]] in the first century.{{sfn |Dioscorides |2000 |loc=p.&nbsp;300}}{{sfn |Lyte |1586}}{{sfn |Grieve |1931}} In 16th-century England, [[William Turner (naturalist)|William Turner]] (1562) mentions it.{{sfn |Turner |1995}} In [[Henry Lyte (botanist)|Henry Lyte]]'s 1586 ''New Herbal'' (a translation into English of [[Dodoens]]' 1554 ''Cruydeboeck''), reference is made to an ''Ornithogalum'' as the White Field Onion. [[John Gerard]], in his ''Herball'' of 1597, describes ''Ornithogalum'' as the \"star of Bethlem\".{{sfn |Gerard |1597}} The species known today as ''Ornithogalum umbellatum'' was first formally described by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] (1753),{{sfn |Linnaeus |1753}} who is the [[botanical authority]] for the [[species]] (L.). ''O. umbellatum'' is the [[type species]] of the [[genus]] ''[[Ornithogalum]]'', which contains about 50 species.{{sfn|Martinez-Azorin et al.|2011}} The [[lectotype]] (reference specimen) was established by [[W. T. Stearn|Stearn]] in 1983.{{sfn |Stearn |1983}}\n\n===Etymology===\nThe species [[epithet]] reflects the flower formation as an umbel.{{sfn |MBG |2019}} The plant's many common names include garden star-of-Bethlehem,{{sfn |BSBI |2019}} sleepydick,{{sfn |USDA |2019}} nap-at-noon,{{sfn |FNA |2003}} grass lily, summer snowflake, snowdrop, starflower, bird's milk, chinkerichee, ten-o'clock lady, eleven-o'clock lady, Bath asparagus, and star of Hungary. The references to the time of day reflect the opening times of the flowers, opening late and closing at night or in cloudy conditions. The star names indicate the arrangement of the petals and bird's milk is a literal translation of ornithogalum.{{sfn |Muma |2019}}{{sfn |DG |2019}}{{sfn |Van Engelen |2019}} It has also been called [[dove's dung]], equating it with a plant described in the bible.{{sfn |Balfour |1885}} {{sfn |Steckel |McClure |2015}} The name star-of-Bethlehem is shared by a number of species of ''Ornithogalum'', due to the white stellate flowers, and the folklore relating the flower to the biblical [[Star of Bethlehem|star-of-Bethlehem]] (''see [[#ipc|In popular culture'']]).{{sfn |Cotes |1898}}\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nA native of most of Europe,{{sfn |Euro+Med Plantbase |2006}} North Africa and western Asia, ''Ornithogalum umbellatum'' has been adopted as an [[ornamental garden plant]] from where it has escaped and [[Naturalised species|naturalised]] widely in North America,{{sfn |FNA |2003}} where it is considered an aggressive [[noxious weed]] of lawns, gardens and no-till agricultural land, which can be difficult to eradicate.{{sfn |Steckel |McClure |2015}} In Europe its range extends from Ireland{{sfn |Devlin |2019}} and Portugal in the west, Italy in the south, north to parts of France and east to Turkey{{sfn |IPANE |2019}}{{sfn |MBG |2019}}{{sfn |USDA |2019}} and the [[Levant]].{{sfn |Cullen et al |2011}}\n\n''O. umbellatum'' prefers damp habitats, being found along rivers, streams, and lower, wet areas of pastures.{{sfn |Steckel |McClure |2015}} It is tolerant to shade and soil type.{{sfn |PFAF |2012}}\n\n==Ecology==\n===Life cycle===\n''Ornithogalum umbellatum'' is thermoperiodic, requiring a cold winter to complete its life cycle.{{sfn|PG|2019}} It first appears in early spring as tufts of leaves, prior to flowering ([[Glossary of botanical terms#proteranthous|proteranthous]]), which occurs in late spring (May\u2013June), the leaves fading prior to blooming. It reproduces by its [[bulbs]], which form many offsetting [[bulbils]] that can be dispersed by water.{{sfn |IPANE |2019}} Like many bulb plants from temperate regions, a period of exposure to cold is necessary before spring growth can begin. This protects the plant from growth during winter when intense cold may damage it. Warmer spring temperatures then initiate growth from the bulb. ''O. umbellatum'' spreads aggressively in clumps by means of these offsets.{{sfn |MBG |2019}}{{sfn |Flowerinfo |2019}}\n\n===Pollination===\nThe flowers are [[insect pollinated]], but may also be [[self-fertile]], forming seeds in summer (June\u2013July).{{sfn |PFAF |2012}} [[Seed dispersal]] plays a relatively minor role in propagation, but accounts for isolated blooms.{{sfn |PG |2019}}\n\n===Effect of light===\nThe petals exhibit [[photoperiodism]], often opening at noon and closing at night or on cloudy days.{{sfn |FNA |2003}}\n{{multiple image | header = Effect of light| align = center | direction = horizontal | total_width= 400 | float = none \n|image1=Ornithogalum umbellatum closed.jpg|caption1=Cloudy day|alt1=Closed flowers on cloudy day| caption_align     =center\n|image2=Ornithogalum umbellatum open.jpg|caption2=Sunny day|alt2=Same plant on sunny day with open flowers\n}}\n\n==Cultivation==\n[[File:Leda and the Swan 1508-1515.jpg|thumb|upright|Leda with star of Bethlehem|alt=Leonardo da Vinci's Leda and the Swan, in which she holds a bouquet of Ornithogalum umbellatum in her hand]]\n''Ornithogalum umbellatum'' requires considerable moisture during winter and spring, but can tolerate summer drought. It can be grown in a woodland garden as semi-shade is preferable. It is [[hardiness (plants)|hardy]] to [[hardiness zone|zone]] 5 UK,{{sfn |PFAF |2012}} 4\u20139 USDA, and can become [[Invasive species|invasive]]. It is produced commercially as an ornamental garden plant.{{sfn |DG |2019}} To control invasive tendencies, it is best to plant in a container or an edged area.{{sfn |Badgett |2018}} ''O. umbellatum'' may be grown as an indoor plant.{{sfn |Palomo |2018}}\n\n==Toxicity==\nThe plant, especially the bulb and flowers, contains [[cardiac glycosides]], specifically [[convallatoxin]] and convalloside which are toxic to humans and livestock.{{sfn |IPANE |2019}}{{sfn |Jordan |2000}}{{sfn |FNA |2003}} Symptoms of poisoning include nausea, salivation, vomiting, diarrhea, and shortness of breath, as well as pain, burning, and swelling of lips, tongue, and throat. Prolonged contact may lead to skin irritation.{{sfn |Steckel |McClure|2015}}{{sfn |Agriculture Canada |2013}}\n\n==Uses==\nDespite the known toxicities, the plant has been described as edible for 2000 years{{sfn |Dioscorides |2000 |loc=p. 300}}{{sfn |Linnaeus |1792}} and incorporated into some traditional regional cuisines (e.g. Turkey){{sfn |Ozbek et al |2017}} and traditional medicine (e.g. India).{{sfn |Krishna et al |2019}} In Britain, the plant has long been the subject of [[herbals]] for its claimed culinary and medicinal properties.{{sfn |Gerard |1597}}{{sfn |Grieve |1931}} This includes drying and grinding the bulbs, or boiling them and baking the flowers into bread.{{sfn |Flowerinfo |2019}}{{sfn |Brown |2011}} [[essential oil|Essences]] are sold as [[patent remedies]] and for [[aromatherapy]],{{sfn |Flowerinfo |2019}} such as [[Bach flower remedies]].{{sfn |Bach |2019}}{{sfn |Huxley et al |1992}} Medical authorities advise against ingesting any part of the plant.{{sfn |WebMD |2019}}\n\n=={{anchor|ipc}}In popular culture==\n[[File:Leonardo botanical study.JPG|thumb|Drawing by Da Vinci|Leonardo da Vinci drawing of flowers]]\n[[Leonardo da Vinci]] drew ''O. umbellatum'' and included the plant in one of his depictions of [[Leda and the Swan (Leonardo)|Leda and the Swan]] (1508\u20131515), in which the flowers are held in Leda's left hand.{{sfn |Capra |2013}}{{sfn |RCT |2019}} In [[folklore]], the biblical star of Bethlehem is said to have fallen to the earth and shattered into pieces which became the ubquitous white flowers.{{sfn |Cotes |1898}} Legend has also associated it with the journeys of [[Crusaders]] and [[pilgrims]] to the [[Holy Land]].{{sfn |Brown |2011}}\n\nA biblical passage in ''2 [[Books of Kings|Kings]]'' 6:25 relates an account of a siege in [[Samaria]] in which the desperate population consumed the excrement of doves (chiriyonim). \"There was a great famine in Samaria; and behold, they besieged it, until a donkey's head was sold for eighty shekels of silver, and a fourth of a kab of dove's dung for five shekels of silver\". There has been considerable discussion as to the exact meaning of this term. In notes taken by [[Paul Dietrich Giseke]] from a lecture by Linnaeus{{sfn |Linnaeus |1792 |loc=p. 287}} it is suggested that this ''Stercus Columbarum'' was in fact the plant ''Ornithogalum umbellatum'', which grew abundantly in Palestine and \"unde Anglis ''Bethlem's Star'' dicitur\" (is known to the English as Bethlem's Star), the white colour of which resembled the excrement of birds, hence the name ''lac Avium'' (bird milk or ''Ornithogalum''), and which was still eaten by the poor of that country.{{sfn |Moldenke |Moldenke |2017 |loc=pp. 153\u2013154}}{{sfn |Smith |1877| |loc=pp. 614\u2013615}}\n\nCulturally, the flower has been associated with purity and hope, atonement and reconciliation.{{sfn |Flowerinfo |2019}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n\n===Books===\n*{{cite book |last1=Blamey |first1=Marjorie |last2=Grey-Wilson |first2=C. |title=The Illustrated Flora of Britain and Northern Europe |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YPd_QgAACAAJ |year=1989 |publisher=[[Hodder & Stoughton]] |isbn=978-0-340-40170-5 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=Capra |first=Fritjof |title=Learning from Leonardo: Decoding the Notebooks of a Genius |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eMLyXT4yoWsC |date=2013 |publisher=Berrett-Koehler Publishers |isbn=978-1-60994-990-7 |page=101 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=Cotes |first=Rosemary A |title=Dante's Garden, with Legends of the Flowers |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fu4OAQAAIAAJ |year=1898 |chapter=The Star of Bethlehem |pages=107\u2013110 |publisher=[[Methuen Publishing|Methuen]] |location=London |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |editor1-last=Cullen |editor1-first=James |editor2-last=Knees |editor2-first=Sabina G. |editor3-last=Cubey |editor3-first=H.

''O. umbellatum'' is a relatively short plant, occurring in tufts of basal linear leaves, producing conspicuous white flowers, in a stellate pattern, in mid to late spring. The flowers open late in the day (hence some of its common names), but when closed have a green stripe on the outside. It is [[native species|native]] throughout most of southern and central [[Europe]], and north-western [[Africa]]. ''O. umbellatum'' is often grown as a [[garden ornamental]], but in [[North America]] and other areas it has escaped cultivation and can be found in many areas, where it may become an [[Invasive species|invasive]] noxious weed. Parts of the plant are considered poisonous, but are used in some regional cuisines. [[Essential oil|Essences]] are also sold as [[patent remedies]]. ''O. umbellatum'' has been depicted in art by artists such as Leonardo da Vinci, and [[folklore]] has suggested it originally grew from fragments of the [[star of Bethlehem]], hence its horticultural name.\n\n==Description==\n''O. umbellatum'' is a [[Perennial plant|perennial]] [[herbaceous]] [[bulbous]] plant ([[geophyte]]), dying back after flowering, to  an underground storage bulb. The following year, it regrows from the often shallow rooted bulbs, which are [[ovoid]] with a membranous coat,{{sfn |IPANE |2019}} {{convert|15|-|25|mm|1}} long and {{convert|18|-|32|mm|1|abbr=on}} in diameter. The bulbs form multiple leaf-bearing bulbils that soon separate but remain close by.{{sfn |Gadella |1972}} Initially the plant forms 6\u201310 basal [[leaf|leaves]], that arise in tufts from the bulbs. The leaves are grooved ([[Glossary of botanical terms#canaliculate|canaliculate]]), smooth ([[glabrousness (botany)|glabrous]]) and linear with a white to light green linear midrib on the upper surface, and grow up to {{convert|30|cm}} long and {{convert|8|mm|1|abbr=on}} broad.{{sfn |Tutin et al |1980}}\n\n''O. umbellatum'' is [[scapose]], with a glabrous flower stem ([[Scape (botany)|scape]]) that emerges from the leaf tufts later and is about {{convert|10|-|30|cm|0|abbr=on}} in height, tapering at its tip.{{sfn |IPANE |2019}} \n{{multiple image | header = Plant Morphology| align = center | direction = horizontal | total_width= 600 | float = none \n|image1 =Ornithogalum umbellatum bulb.jpg|caption1=Bulb with bulbil|alt1=Bulb with associated bulbil\n|image2 =Ornithogalum umbellatum plant.jpg|caption2=Ornithogalum plant|alt2=Entire plant after digging up\n|image3 =Ornithogalum umbellatum (Dame de onze heures) 01.JPG|caption3= Clump of scapes with closed flowers arising from basal leaves|alt3=Scapes arising from tuft of leaves \n}}\nThe [[inflorescence]] bears 6\u201320 flat star shaped flowers on ascending stems ([[pedicels]]) ({{convert|3|-|3.5|cm|abbr=on}}) associated with membranaceous leaflets ([[bracts]]) ({{convert|2.5|-|3|cm|abbr=on}}) in an open branching umbrella ([[umbel]]) shaped terminal cluster, described as a [[Panicle|corymbose]] [[raceme]].{{sfn |Gadella |1972}} The petal-like [[perianth]] is radially symmetric ([[actinomorphic]]), which is {{convert|1.5|-|2|cm|1}} in diameter, consists of six [[lanceolate]] [[tepals]] which are white with a green stripe on the underside (outside), {{convert|15|mm|abbr=on}} in length and {{convert|5|mm|abbr=on}} wide. From the outside the closed flower appears green with white margins.{{sfn |IPANE |2019}}\n\nThe reproductive parts consist of both male ([[androecium]]) and female ([[gynoecium]]) parts ([[Hermaphrodite (botany)|hermaphrodite]]). The androecium has six yellow-brown [[stamens]] that are free of the perianth and form two groups, each of about {{convert|5|-|8|mm|1}}, with filaments that are simple and flattened and oblong anthers that are {{convert|2|-|4|mm|}}. The gynoecium has a single pistil with a superior (i. e. above the floral parts) [[Ovary (botany)|ovary]] that is ovoid to obovoid, {{convert|3|-|4|mm|1}}, and longer than the [[Style (botany)|style]] that extends above it. The [[fruit]] is a [[capsule (fruit)|capsule]] which is oblong-ovoid with 3 sides and 6 ribs. Within it, each [[locule]] contains many seeds with a black coat of [[phytomelan]] (''see [[Floral diagram]]'').{{sfn |Blamey |Grey-Wilson |1989}}{{sfn |Jordan |2000}} The species is [[polyploid]] (having more than two sets of [[chromosomes]]).{{sfn |FNA |2003}}\n{{multiple image | header = Floral Morphology| align = center | direction = horizontal | total_width= 600 | float = none \n|image1 =Ornithogalum umbellatum inflorescence.jpg|caption1=Inflorescence, pedicels & bracts|alt1=Arrangement of floers in inflorescence\n|image2 =Ornithogalum umbellatum 12.JPG| caption2 = Underside of tepals|alt2=Underside of tepals\n|image3 =Ornithogalum umbellatum 003.JPG|caption3= Detail of flower from above|alt3=Flower seen from above, close up \n|image4 =Ornithogalum umbellatum1.jpg|caption4= Flower from side|alt4= Side view of flower\n|image5 =Ornithogalum umbellatum lateral.jpg|caption5=Detail of structures|alt5=Lateral view of reproductive organs\n|image6 =ORNITHOGALUM UMBELLATUM - TOR\u00c0 - IB-915 (Llet de gallina).JPG|caption6= Capsules on scapes|alt6= Capsules on scapes, following pollination\n}}\n\n==Taxonomy==\n{{multiple image | header = | align = center | direction = horizontal | total_width= 250 | float = none \n|image1 =Star of Bethlem.png|caption1=Illustration by [[John Gerard]]<br>1597|alt1=John Gerard's illustration\n|image2 =Ornithogalum.png|caption2=Description by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]]<br>1753|alt2=page from Linnaeus' Species Plantarum, describing Ornithogalum umbellatum\n}}\n''Ornithogalum umbellatum'' has been known and described for a long time, according to some authors, as far back as [[Dioscorides]] in the first century.{{sfn |Dioscorides |2000 |loc=p.&nbsp;300}}{{sfn |Lyte |1586}}{{sfn |Grieve |1931}} In 16th-century England, [[William Turner (naturalist)|William Turner]] (1562) mentions it.{{sfn |Turner |1995}} In [[Henry Lyte (botanist)|Henry Lyte]]'s 1586 ''New Herbal'' (a translation into English of [[Dodoens]]' 1554 ''Cruydeboeck''), reference is made to an ''Ornithogalum'' as the White Field Onion. [[John Gerard]], in his ''Herball'' of 1597, describes ''Ornithogalum'' as the \"star of Bethlem\".{{sfn |Gerard |1597}} The species known today as ''Ornithogalum umbellatum'' was first formally described by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] (1753),{{sfn |Linnaeus |1753}} who is the [[botanical authority]] for the [[species]] (L.). ''O. umbellatum'' is the [[type species]] of the [[genus]] ''[[Ornithogalum]]'', which contains about 50 species.{{sfn|Martinez-Azorin et al.|2011}} The [[lectotype]] (reference specimen) was established by [[W. T. Stearn|Stearn]] in 1983.{{sfn |Stearn |1983}}\n\n===Etymology===\nThe species [[epithet]] reflects the flower formation as an umbel.{{sfn |MBG |2019}} The plant's many common names include garden star-of-Bethlehem,{{sfn |BSBI |2019}} sleepydick,{{sfn |USDA |2019}} nap-at-noon,{{sfn |FNA |2003}} grass lily, summer snowflake, snowdrop, starflower, bird's milk, chinkerichee, ten-o'clock lady, eleven-o'clock lady, Bath asparagus, and star of Hungary. The references to the time of day reflect the opening times of the flowers, opening late and closing at night or in cloudy conditions. The star names indicate the arrangement of the petals and bird's milk is a literal translation of ornithogalum.{{sfn |Muma |2019}}{{sfn |DG |2019}}{{sfn |Van Engelen |2019}} It has also been called [[dove's dung]], equating it with a plant described in the bible.{{sfn |Balfour |1885}} {{sfn |Steckel |McClure |2015}} The name star-of-Bethlehem is shared by a number of species of ''Ornithogalum'', due to the white stellate flowers, and the folklore relating the flower to the biblical [[Star of Bethlehem|star-of-Bethlehem]] (''see [[#ipc|In popular culture'']]).{{sfn |Cotes |1898}}\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nA native of most of Europe,{{sfn |Euro+Med Plantbase |2006}} North Africa and western Asia, ''Ornithogalum umbellatum'' has been adopted as an [[ornamental garden plant]] from where it has escaped and [[Naturalised species|naturalised]] widely in North America,{{sfn |FNA |2003}} where it is considered an aggressive [[noxious weed]] of lawns, gardens and no-till agricultural land, which can be difficult to eradicate.{{sfn |Steckel |McClure |2015}} In Europe its range extends from Ireland{{sfn |Devlin |2019}} and Portugal in the west, Italy in the south, north to parts of France and east to Turkey{{sfn |IPANE |2019}}{{sfn |MBG |2019}}{{sfn |USDA |2019}} and the [[Levant]].{{sfn |Cullen et al |2011}}\n\n''O. umbellatum'' prefers damp habitats, being found along rivers, streams, and lower, wet areas of pastures.{{sfn |Steckel |McClure |2015}} It is tolerant to shade and soil type.{{sfn |PFAF |2012}}\n\n==Ecology==\n===Life cycle===\n''Ornithogalum umbellatum'' is thermoperiodic, requiring a cold winter to complete its life cycle.{{sfn|PG|2019}} It first appears in early spring as tufts of leaves, prior to flowering ([[Glossary of botanical terms#proteranthous|proteranthous]]), which occurs in late spring (May\u2013June), the leaves fading prior to blooming. It reproduces by its [[bulbs]], which form many offsetting [[bulbils]] that can be dispersed by water.{{sfn |IPANE |2019}} Like many bulb plants from temperate regions, a period of exposure to cold is necessary before spring growth can begin. This protects the plant from growth during winter when intense cold may damage it. Warmer spring temperatures then initiate growth from the bulb. ''O. umbellatum'' spreads aggressively in clumps by means of these offsets.{{sfn |MBG |2019}}{{sfn |Flowerinfo |2019}}\n\n===Pollination===\nThe flowers are [[insect pollinated]], but may also be [[self-fertile]], forming seeds in summer (June\u2013July).{{sfn |PFAF |2012}} [[Seed dispersal]] plays a relatively minor role in propagation, but accounts for isolated blooms.{{sfn |PG |2019}}\n\n===Effect of light===\nThe petals exhibit [[photoperiodism]], often opening at noon and closing at night or on cloudy days.{{sfn |FNA |2003}}\n{{multiple image | header = Effect of light| align = center | direction = horizontal | total_width= 400 | float = none \n|image1=Ornithogalum umbellatum closed.jpg|caption1=Cloudy day|alt1=Closed flowers on cloudy day| caption_align     =center\n|image2=Ornithogalum umbellatum open.jpg|caption2=Sunny day|alt2=Same plant on sunny day with open flowers\n}}\n\n==Cultivation==\n[[File:Leda and the Swan 1508-1515.jpg|thumb|upright|Leda with star of Bethlehem|alt=Leonardo da Vinci's Leda and the Swan, in which she holds a bouquet of Ornithogalum umbellatum in her hand]]\n''Ornithogalum umbellatum'' requires considerable moisture during winter and spring, but can tolerate summer drought. It can be grown in a woodland garden as semi-shade is preferable. It is [[hardiness (plants)|hardy]] to [[hardiness zone|zone]] 5 UK,{{sfn |PFAF |2012}} 4\u20139 USDA, and can become [[Invasive species|invasive]]. It is produced commercially as an ornamental garden plant.{{sfn |DG |2019}} To control invasive tendencies, it is best to plant in a container or an edged area.{{sfn |Badgett |2018}} ''O. umbellatum'' may be grown as an indoor plant.{{sfn |Palomo |2018}}\n\n==Toxicity==\nThe plant, especially the bulb and flowers, contains [[cardiac glycosides]], specifically [[convallatoxin]] and convalloside which are toxic to humans and livestock.{{sfn |IPANE |2019}}{{sfn |Jordan |2000}}{{sfn |FNA |2003}} Symptoms of poisoning include nausea, salivation, vomiting, diarrhea, and shortness of breath, as well as pain, burning, and swelling of lips, tongue, and throat. Prolonged contact may lead to skin irritation.{{sfn |Steckel |McClure|2015}}{{sfn |Agriculture Canada |2013}}\n\n==Uses==\nDespite the known toxicities, the plant has been described as edible for 2000 years{{sfn |Dioscorides |2000 |loc=p. 300}}{{sfn |Linnaeus |1792}} and incorporated into some traditional regional cuisines (e. g. Turkey){{sfn |Ozbek et al |2017}} and traditional medicine (e. g. India).{{sfn |Krishna et al |2019}} In Britain, the plant has long been the subject of [[herbals]] for its claimed culinary and medicinal properties.{{sfn |Gerard |1597}}{{sfn |Grieve |1931}} This includes drying and grinding the bulbs, or boiling them and baking the flowers into bread.{{sfn |Flowerinfo |2019}}{{sfn |Brown |2011}} [[essential oil|Essences]] are sold as [[patent remedies]] and for [[aromatherapy]],{{sfn |Flowerinfo |2019}} such as [[Bach flower remedies]].{{sfn |Bach |2019}}{{sfn |Huxley et al |1992}} Medical authorities advise against ingesting any part of the plant.{{sfn |WebMD |2019}}\n\n=={{anchor|ipc}}In popular culture==\n[[File:Leonardo botanical study.JPG|thumb|Drawing by Da Vinci|Leonardo da Vinci drawing of flowers]]\n[[Leonardo da Vinci]] drew ''O. umbellatum'' and included the plant in one of his depictions of [[Leda and the Swan (Leonardo)|Leda and the Swan]] (1508\u20131515), in which the flowers are held in Leda's left hand.{{sfn |Capra |2013}}{{sfn |RCT |2019}} In [[folklore]], the biblical star of Bethlehem is said to have fallen to the earth and shattered into pieces which became the ubquitous white flowers.{{sfn |Cotes |1898}} Legend has also associated it with the journeys of [[Crusaders]] and [[pilgrims]] to the [[Holy Land]].{{sfn |Brown |2011}}\n\nA biblical passage in ''2 [[Books of Kings|Kings]]'' 6:25 relates an account of a siege in [[Samaria]] in which the desperate population consumed the excrement of doves (chiriyonim). \"There was a great famine in Samaria; and behold, they besieged it, until a donkey's head was sold for eighty shekels of silver, and a fourth of a kab of dove's dung for five shekels of silver\". There has been considerable discussion as to the exact meaning of this term. In notes taken by [[Paul Dietrich Giseke]] from a lecture by Linnaeus{{sfn |Linnaeus |1792 |loc=p. 287}} it is suggested that this ''Stercus Columbarum'' was in fact the plant ''Ornithogalum umbellatum'', which grew abundantly in Palestine and \"unde Anglis ''Bethlem's Star'' dicitur\" (is known to the English as Bethlem's Star), the white colour of which resembled the excrement of birds, hence the name ''lac Avium'' (bird milk or ''Ornithogalum''), and which was still eaten by the poor of that country.{{sfn |Moldenke |Moldenke |2017 |loc=pp. 153\u2013154}}{{sfn |Smith |1877| |loc=pp. 614\u2013615}}\n\nCulturally, the flower has been associated with purity and hope, atonement and reconciliation.{{sfn |Flowerinfo |2019}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n\n===Books===\n*{{cite book |last1=Blamey |first1=Marjorie |last2=Grey-Wilson |first2=C. |title=The Illustrated Flora of Britain and Northern Europe |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YPd_QgAACAAJ |year=1989 |publisher=[[Hodder & Stoughton]] |isbn=978-0-340-40170-5 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=Capra |first=Fritjof |title=Learning from Leonardo: Decoding the Notebooks of a Genius |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eMLyXT4yoWsC |date=2013 |publisher=Berrett-Koehler Publishers |isbn=978-1-60994-990-7 |page=101 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=Cotes |first=Rosemary A |title=Dante's Garden, with Legends of the Flowers |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fu4OAQAAIAAJ |year=1898 |chapter=The Star of Bethlehem |pages=107\u2013110 |publisher=[[Methuen Publishing|Methuen]] |location=London |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |editor1-last=Cullen |editor1-first=James |editor2-last=Knees |editor2-first=Sabina G. |editor3-last=Cubey |editor3-first=H.

It is part of [[Greater Toronto Area|Greater Toronto]] in the [[Golden Horseshoe]] region of [[Southern Ontario]].\n\nThe town was formed as one of many farming communities in the area, but also developed an industrial centre on the [[Northern Railway of Canada]]'s mainline, which was built in 1853 through what would become the downtown area.<ref>{{cite web |last1=McChesney |first1=Peggy |title=A Brief History of the Town of Newmarket |url=https://www.newmarket.ca/ThingsToDo/Documents/History%20-%20Terry%20Carter%20Compilation.pdf#page=3 |website=Newmarket |publisher=Town of Newmarket |accessdate=23 August 2019}}</ref>It also became a thriving market town with the arrival of the [[Metropolitan Street Railway (Toronto)|Metropolitan Street Railway]] in 1899.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wyatt |first1=David |title=Toronto and York Radial Interurban |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180713073546/http://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~wyatt/alltime/toronto-suburbs-on.html |website=All-Time List of Canadian Transit Systems |accessdate=23 August 2019}}</ref> Over time, the town developed into a primarily residential area, and the expansion of [[Ontario Highway 400]] to the west and the construction of [[Ontario Highway 404]] to the east increasingly turned it into a [[bedroom town]] since the 1980s. The province's Official Plan, however, includes growth in the business services and knowledge industries, as well as in the administrative, manufacturing and retail sectors.\n\nSome of Newmarket's most noticeable landmarks are the [[Upper Canada Mall]], [[Southlake Regional Health Centre]], the Main Street [[Heritage Conservation District]], the Fairy Lake Conservation Area, as well as many other parks and recreation areas.\n\n== History ==\nNewmarket's location on the [[Holland River]] long ago made the area a natural route of travel between [[Lake Ontario]] and [[Lake Simcoe]]. A major [[portage]] route, the [[Toronto Carrying-Place Trail]] ran one of its two routes down the [[Holland River|Holland]], through the Newmarket area, and over the [[Oak Ridges Moraine]] to the [[Rouge River (Ontario)|Rouge River]] and into Lake Ontario. A more widely used route ran down the western branch of the [[Holland River]], over the moraine, and down the [[Humber River (Ontario)|Humber River]]. In 1793, [[John Graves Simcoe]] travelled the trail, northward along the main route to the west, and south to [[York, Upper Canada|York]] (now [[Toronto]]) along the lesser used eastern route though Newmarket. Selecting the eastern route as the better of the two, Simcoe started construction of [[Yonge Street]] along the former trail in late 1795, starting in York in [[Toronto Harbour|Toronto Bay]], and ending at the newly named St. Albans ([[Holland Landing]]), north of Newmarket.\n\n[[File:John Bogart House three quarter BW view.JPG|thumbnail|left|The John Bogart House on Leslie Street is the oldest residential structure in Newmarket and the oldest two-storey residential building north of Toronto. It was built in 1811 and still serves as a house.]]\n\n===Early settlement===\nSome of the United States Quakers were interested in moving northward, disturbed by the violence they were expected to take part in during the [[American Revolution]]. In June 1800, Timothy Rogers, a [[Quaker]] from [[Vermont]], explored the area around the Holland River to find a suitable location for a new Quaker settlement. He, Samuel Lundy and their group of Religious Society of Friends received the grant of a large amount of land. In 1801 Rogers returned along with several Quaker families who had left their homes in [[Vermont]] and [[Pennsylvania]]. They settled here in 1801-1803.<ref name=\"ontarioplaques.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ontarioplaques.com/Plaques/Plaque_York14.html|title=Founding of Newmarket Historical Plaque |website=www.ontarioplaques.com| accessdate=May 1, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 1801, the Quaker families acquired {{convert|8000|acres|ha}} around the Holland River.

Hill also built a [[Tanning (leather)|tannery]] just to the north of the mill, and the first general store and house, as well as additional mills.\n\nBy 1802, [[Elisha Beman]], who owned a great deal of land in the area, had begun to establish businesses.<ref name=\"ontarioplaques.com\"/> A mill was first and other businesses (including a [[distillery]]) soon followed. Mordecai Millar also built mills and Joseph Hill opened a tannery. During the [[War of 1812]] a resident, William Roe, was able to hide gold that was in the settlement's treasury, saving it from invading American troops. The war also helped bring some prosperity as the army purchased goods and food and hired locals to build structures.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Carter |first1=Robert Terence |title=Stories of Newmarket: An Old Ontario Town |publisher=Dundurn |page=76 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=IKwo5Fb7_YUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Newmarket,+ontario+war+of+1812&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjI18aZt8fTAhVBw4MKHbG6DQ8Q6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&q=war%20of%201812&f=false |accessdate=13 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nBy 1814, the settlement had two frame and several log buildings used as residences.<ref name=\"electriccanadian.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.electriccanadian.com/history/ontario/york/part03chap11.htm |title=History of Toronto and County of York in Ontario Part III: Town of Newmarket |accessdate=April 28, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170819060727/http://www.electriccanadian.com/history/ontario/york/part03chap11.htm |archivedate=August 19, 2017 }}</ref> The town continued to grow through the early 19th century, along with the formation of [[Aurora, Ontario|Aurora]] and [[Holland Landing, Ontario|Holland Landing]], and a market held in the current downtown location gave rise to the name \"Newmarket\".\n\nNewmarket played a central role in the [[Rebellions of 1837\u20131838]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cfha.info/journal77p57.pdf |title=The War of 1812-14 and the Rebellion of 1837 from \u201cThe Story of Sharon\u201d |accessdate=April 28, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180501154110/http://cfha.info/journal77p57.pdf |archivedate=May 1, 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The Rebellion of 1837 in Upper Canada : a collection of documents |year=1985 |publisher=Champlain Society in cooperation with the Ontario Heritage Foundation |isbn=0-88629-026-0 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/rebellionof1837i0000unse/page/182 182]\u2013186 |edition=Second Printing |url=https://archive.org/details/rebellionof1837i0000unse |url-access=registration |quote=Newmarket . |accessdate=13 November 2018}}</ref> The town was a focal point of discontent against the manipulations of the governing Family Compact, of whom it was said \"were robbing the country\". Rebel leader [[William Lyon Mackenzie]] organized a series of meetings leading to the Rebellion. During the first of these meetings, on August 3, 1837, Mackenzie delivered his first campaign speech from the veranda of the North American Hotel at the corner of Botsford and Main Streets. This speech is largely credited for being the spark to the rebellion as it was heard by about 600 farmers and others sympathetic to Mackenzie\u2019s cause, who later that year armed themselves and marched down Yonge St. to take the capital. A number of leaders from this area were [[Attainder|attainted]] for [[high treason]], convicted and [[Hanging|hanged]].<ref>{{cite book |title=History of Toronto and County of York, Ontario |year=1885 |publisher=C.

By the 1950s, Newmarket was experiencing a suburban building boom due to its proximity to Toronto. The population increased from 5,000 to 11,000 between 1950 and 1970.\n\nThe [[Regional Municipality of York]] was formed in 1971, increasing the size of Newmarket with land from the Township of East Gwillimbury, from the Township of King and from the Township of Whitchurch. \n<ref name=\"newmarket.ca\"/> The construction of [[Upper Canada Mall]] at the corner of Yonge Street and Davis Drive in 1974 started pulling the focal point of the town westward from the historic Downtown area along Main Street.\n\nBy the early 1980s, the historic Downtown area suffered as most businesses had built up in the area around Upper Canada Mall, with additional [[strip mall]]s developing directly across the Yonge Street/Davis Drive intersection to the south and southeast. A concerted effort to revitalize the historic Downtown area during the late 1980s was successful. More recently, a $2.3-million investment was made by the town in 2004 in streetscaping and infrastructure improvements to roads and sidewalks in the historic Downtown.

The southern boundary of the town is contiguous with [[Aurora, Ontario|Aurora]] to the south.\n\nArmitage was the first settlement of [[King, Ontario|King]] township, named in honour of its first settler Amos Armitage.<ref name=\"Carter\" /><!-- page 50 --> He had been recruited by Timothy Rogers, a [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] from [[Vermont]], who in 1801 had travelled along [[Yonge Street]] and found the area appealing, and so applied for and received a grant for land totalling 40 farms, each of {{convert|200|acre|km2|1}}.\n\nOther defunct communities once located within the modern boundaries of Newmarket include Garbut's Hill, Paddytown, Petchville, Pleasantville, and White Rose.<ref name=\"Carter\" /><!-- page 51-52 -->\n\n== Geography ==\nNewmarket's geographical coordinates are 44.05\u00b0N, 79.46\u00b0W, and its elevation above [[sea level]] is 252&nbsp;m.<ref>{{cite web |title=Newmarket, Canada Page |url=http://www.fallingrain.com/world/CA/08/Newmarket.html |publisher=Falling Rain Software, Ltd. |accessdate=13 November 2018}}</ref> It has an area of 38.33&nbsp;km\u00b2. The town is bounded on the south by [[Aurora, Ontario|Aurora]], on the west by [[King, Ontario|King]], on the north by [[East Gwillimbury]] and on the east by [[Whitchurch\u2013Stouffville]].\n\nThe main river in Newmarket is the [[East Holland River]] (known locally simply as \"The [[Holland River]]\"), and all other streams in the town are tributaries thereto. These include Bogart Creek, a brook that weaves its way into the town from the [[Oak Ridges Moraine]] by way of [[Bogarttown, Ontario|Bogarttown]], emptying into the Holland River in north-central Newmarket; Western creek, another brook rising just west of the town, and reaching the Holland River in the town's north end; Tannery Creek, a stream that joins the Holland River in south Newmarket after flowing through [[Aurora, Ontario|Aurora]]; and a number of other small watercourses.\n\nThere are two [[reservoir]]s in Newmarket; Fairy Lake (which is managed by the [[Lake Simcoe Region Conservation Authority]]), a favourite recreational area in the centre of town, is a former [[mill pond]] on the East Holland River; and Bogart Pond, also a former mill pond, is fed and drained by Bogart Creek in Bogarttown. Furthermore, the water level in the reach of the East Holland north of Davis Drive is controlled from an unfinished [[Newmarket Canal]] lock, now used as a [[weir]].\n\nNewmarket also lies south of and above the [[Glacial Lake Algonquin|Algonquin Shoreline]], where elevations suddenly drop off from the gently rolling hills that characterize much of Newmarket to the much flatter, lower land down below in the [[Holland Marsh]].\n\nThe land is characterized mainly by [[till|glacial deposits]] from the last [[ice age]], known as \"Newmarket Till\". The town is underlain mainly by sand and gravel, ground by the [[Ice sheet|icesheets]] that covered the area until about 10,000 years ago. No [[outcrop]]s are to be found anywhere in Newmarket, so deep are the glacial deposits.\n\n== Climate ==\nNewmarket has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Humid continental climate#Koppen Dfb|K\u00f6ppen climate classification ''Dfb'']]), with four distinct seasons featuring cold, somewhat snowy winters and warm, humid summers. Precipitation is moderate and consistent in all seasons, although summers are a bit wetter than winter due to the moisture from the Gulf of Mexico and the Great Lakes.\n\n{{Weather box\n| collapsed    = yes\n| metric first = yes\n| single line  = yes\n| location     = Newmarket/King Smoke Tree &ndash; 1981&ndash;2010{{efn|Dates may vary.

There is also a Christian private elementary school, Newmarket District Christian Academy (NDCA).\n\nNewmarket is also the home of [[Pickering College]], an independent day and boarding school, as well as a campus of [[Seneca College]].\n\n== Local government ==\nJohn Taylor was elected in October 2018 to become mayor, succeeding [[Tony Van Bynen]] who was [[List of mayors of Newmarket, Ontario|mayor]] from 2006 to 2018. (See [[List of mayors of Newmarket, Ontario|list of previous mayors]])\n\nThe town's council includes a mayor, seven councillors elected on the basis of one per ward, and a regional councillor who is elected to join the mayor at meetings of [[York Regional Council]]. The members of council elected in 2018 are:<ref name=\"2010council\">{{cite web|url=https://vote.newmarket.ca/Modules/News/index.aspx?newsId=d2c5f9e5-80bf-400b-822b-e900c16a1c3c|title=2018 Municipal Election|website=Town of Newmarket|publisher=Town of Newmarket|accessdate=November 14, 2018}}</ref>\n\n'''Mayor''': John Taylor\n\n'''Deputy Mayor & Regional Councillor''': Tom Vegh\n\n'''Councillors''':\n\n* Ward 1: Grace Simon\n* Ward 2: Victor Woodhouse\n* Ward 3: Jane Twinney\n* Ward 4: Trevor Morrison\n* Ward 5: Bob Kwapis\n* Ward 6: Kelly Broome\n* Ward 7: Christina Bisanz\n\nProvincially, Newmarket is part of the riding of [[Newmarket\u2014Aurora (provincial electoral district)|Newmarket\u2014Aurora]] represented by [[Christine Elliott]], a member of the [[PC Party of Ontario]], and elected in 2018. The province realigned its ridings to match those of the federal government in 2004.\n\nFederally, Newmarket is part of the riding of [[Electoral district (Canada)|federal riding]] of [[Newmarket\u2014Aurora]]. The riding is represented in the [[House of Commons of Canada]] by [[Kyle Peterson (politician)|Kyle Peterson]], a member of the [[Liberal Party of Canada]], who was first elected in the [[2015 Canadian federal election|2015 federal election]].\n\n==Policing==\n\nThe [[York Regional Police]] is the primary police agency in Newmarket. [[Ontario Provincial Police]] patrol on provincially maintained highways in Newmarket like [[Highway 404 (Ontario)|Highway 404]].\n\nThe [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] North Toronto Detachment is located in Newmarket.\n\n== Urban planning ==\n\nThe part of Newmarket built before [[World War II]] surrounding Main Street is very typical of a small Ontario city, in terms of walkability and mixes of use.  Other areas of the town are typical of post-war development commonly found throughout many suburban areas.\n\nNewmarket is identified as one of the Golden Horseshoe's 25 Urban Growth Centres in Ontario's Places to Grow Growth Plan.<ref name=Placestogrow>{{cite web|url=http://www.newmarket.ca/userfiles/page_attachments/Library/1/3107712_Newmarket_OP___Consolidated_Modifications___2008_04___Regional_Approval.pdf|format=PDF|title= Town of Newmarket 2-2006 Official Plan|date=October 10, 2006|publisher=Town of Newmarket|accessdate=August 25, 2008}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>\n\nFour areas of Newmarket have been selected to absorb the majority of planned population growth and accommodate mixed usages on sites well served by transit.

The library also runs the York Info service, which provides information about local organizations, groups and services, and helps develop a stronger volunteer presence in the community by connecting people who would like to volunteer with non-profit agencies looking for assistance. The library also produces a quarterly newsletter called \"Off the Shelf\" to inform patrons of its programs, services and events. The library is a founding member of the Shared Digital Infrastructure (SDI) project, an initiative to plan for an Intelligent Community in Newmarket.\n\n== Theatre ==\n* The Newmarket Theatre is the largest performing arts theatre in the town, with a capacity of 400. It hosts a selection of world class artists annually.\n* The Resurgence Theatre Company is a smaller professional company that is focused on resurging the classics and igniting new and contemporary works within York Region and beyond. The company produces an annual Shakespearean production with live performances in the Fairy Lake Conservation Area near the historic Downtown.\n* Old Town Hall has hosted organized theatre and performing arts for over 100 years, and in March 2012 the Town of Newmarket announced that a formal 250-seat theatre would be included as part of its revitalization. Construction on this initiative started in May 2013 and was expected to be complete in the fall of 2016.\n\n== Sports and recreation ==\n\n=== Hockey ===\nNewmarket was previously home to the following teams:\n* [[ Newmarket Hurricanes ]] from 1987 to 2019, an [[Ontario Provincial Junior A Hockey League]]. The franchise was moved to [[ Milton, Ontario ]] and renamed to the [[Milton Menace]].<ref>{{cite web |title=UPDATE: Junior A Hurricanes are skating out of Newmarket |url=https://www.yorkregion.com/news-story/9245956-update-junior-a-hurricanes-are-skating-out-of-newmarket/ |website=yorkregion.com |publisher=Torstar |accessdate=22 August 2019}}</ref>\n* [[Newmarket Saints]] from 1986 to 1991, an American Hockey League franchise and [[farm team]] of the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] who moved from [[St. Catharines]]. The franchise was later moved to [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's, Newfoundland]] and became the [[St. John's Maple Leafs]].\n* [[Newmarket Royals]] from 1992 to 1994. This was a franchise of the [[Ontario Hockey League]] who were previously the [[Cornwall Royals]] and in 1994 moved again to become the [[Sarnia Sting]].\n* Newmarket Flyers from 1975 to 1986, OPJHL Jr. A (formerly The Seneca Flyers).\n* Newmarket Redmen from late 1920s to 1972 Jr. B.\n\nJunior Leagues\nNewmarket is also home to many rep and select teams. They go by the name of the Newmarket Redmen and range from divisions of Tyke to Midget.\n\n=== Golf ===\nOne golf course is located within Newmarket's town limits; St. Andrew's Valley (a public club), which straddles the Aurora/Newmarket border. Glenway Country Club was a private club with a course within Newmarket's boundaries, but it was closed before the 2012 season and is slated for redevelopment.<ref>{{cite web|last=Latchford|first=Teresa|title=Glenway won\u2019t reopen in 2012|url=http://www.yorkregion.com/article/1059739--glenway-won-t-reopen-in-2012|work=Yorkregion.com|publisher=Metroland News|accessdate=November 13, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThere are also several courses in the surrounding communities and countryside.\n\n=== Swimming ===\nThree public swimming places exist throughout Newmarket: [[Ray Twinney Complex]], Gorman Pool, which is open only in the summer, and the Magna Centre.\n\n=== Curling ===\nNewmarket is home to the [[List of curling clubs in Ontario#Zone 7|York Curling Club]].\n\n== Media ==\n=== Print ===\nLocal print media is provided by ''[[The Newmarket Era]]'' (formerly the ''Era Banner''). The paper traces its lineage back to 1852, when English immigrant printer G.S. Porter first published ''The New Era'' in Newmarket. Today, it is published twice a week (Thursday and Sunday).\n\n=== Radio ===\nNewmarket is well served by [[Media in Toronto#Radio|radio stations from Toronto]].\n\n== Arms ==\n[[Image:NewmarketONCoA.gif|thumb|Newmarket's coat of arms]]\n\nNewmarket's [[coat of arms]] is actually taken from the town's old corporate seal. The town [[flag]] is a navy blue field with this same design in the middle. The beehive and bees are said to represent industry. There are nine bees, representing the town's nine most prominent businesses at the time that Newmarket was incorporated as a Village.<ref>{{cite web |title=Museum FAQ |url=https://www.newmarket.ca/ThingsToDo/Pages/Recreation%20and%20Culture/Elman%20W.%20Campbell%20Museum/Museum-FAQ.aspx |website=Town of Newmarket |accessdate=2 August 2019}}</ref> The latest form of the [[Seal (device)|seal]] was introduced in 1938 with the arms somewhat altered from&nbsp;\u2013 but very similar in concept to&nbsp;\u2013 one that was earlier used. The arms' origin is something of a mystery, however. It is unknown what artist created the current version&nbsp;\u2013 or indeed the earlier version&nbsp;\u2013 and the town has no official record as to the purchase or redesign of the arms.<ref>{{cite web |title=Town of Newmarket Emblem |url=http://www.newmarket.ca/userfiles/HTML/nts_1_477_1.html |publisher=Town of Newmarket |accessdate=13 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051123153539/http://www.newmarket.ca/userfiles/HTML/nts_1_477_1.html |archivedate=23 November 2005}}</ref>\n\n== Notable people ==\n<!-- -notability for this list is established by the existence of a Wikipedia article on the subject-- -->\n* [[Dorian Baxter]], politician, priest, Elvis impersonator\n* [[John Candy]], comedian/actor\n* [[Jim Carrey]], comedian/actor<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jimcarreyonline.com/info/biography.html |title=Biography |publisher=Jim Carrey Online |accessdate=May 7, 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120518223337/http://www.jimcarreyonline.com/info/biography.html |archivedate=May 18, 2012 }}</ref>\n* [[Munro Chambers]], actor\n* [[Frances Champagne]], professor, neuroscientist<ref>[https://www.classfinders.com/directory/on/newmarket/]</ref>{{better citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n*[[Florence Shirley Patterson Jones]], astronomer\n* [[H.R.

The province's Official Plan, however, includes growth in the business services and knowledge industries, as well as in the administrative, manufacturing and retail sectors.\n\nSome of Newmarket's most noticeable landmarks are the [[Upper Canada Mall]], [[Southlake Regional Health Centre]], the Main Street [[Heritage Conservation District]], the Fairy Lake Conservation Area, as well as many other parks and recreation areas.\n\n== History ==\nNewmarket's location on the [[Holland River]] long ago made the area a natural route of travel between [[Lake Ontario]] and [[Lake Simcoe]]. A major [[portage]] route, the [[Toronto Carrying-Place Trail]] ran one of its two routes down the [[Holland River|Holland]], through the Newmarket area, and over the [[Oak Ridges Moraine]] to the [[Rouge River (Ontario)|Rouge River]] and into Lake Ontario. A more widely used route ran down the western branch of the [[Holland River]], over the moraine, and down the [[Humber River (Ontario)|Humber River]]. In 1793, [[John Graves Simcoe]] travelled the trail, northward along the main route to the west, and south to [[York, Upper Canada|York]] (now [[Toronto]]) along the lesser used eastern route though Newmarket. Selecting the eastern route as the better of the two, Simcoe started construction of [[Yonge Street]] along the former trail in late 1795, starting in York in [[Toronto Harbour|Toronto Bay]], and ending at the newly named St. Albans ([[Holland Landing]]), north of Newmarket.\n\n[[File:John Bogart House three quarter BW view.JPG|thumbnail|left|The John Bogart House on Leslie Street is the oldest residential structure in Newmarket and the oldest two-storey residential building north of Toronto. It was built in 1811 and still serves as a house.]]\n\n===Early settlement===\nSome of the United States Quakers were interested in moving northward, disturbed by the violence they were expected to take part in during the [[American Revolution]]. In June 1800, Timothy Rogers, a [[Quaker]] from [[Vermont]], explored the area around the Holland River to find a suitable location for a new Quaker settlement. He, Samuel Lundy and their group of Religious Society of Friends received the grant of a large amount of land. In 1801 Rogers returned along with several Quaker families who had left their homes in [[Vermont]] and [[Pennsylvania]]. They settled here in 1801-1803.<ref name=\"ontarioplaques.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ontarioplaques.com/Plaques/Plaque_York14.html|title=Founding of Newmarket Historical Plaque |website=www.ontarioplaques.com| accessdate=May 1, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 1801, the Quaker families acquired {{convert|8000|acres|ha}} around the Holland River. Joseph Hill constructed a mill on the river,<ref name=\"ontarioplaques.com\"/> damming it to produce a [[mill pond]] that is now known as Fairy Lake.<ref name=\"newmarket.ca\">{{cite web |url=http://www.newmarket.ca/ThingsToDo/Documents/History%20-%20Terry%20Carter%20Compilation.pdf |title=A Brief History of the Town of Newmarket |accessdate=February 9, 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428155938/http://www.newmarket.ca/ThingsToDo/Documents/History%20-%20Terry%20Carter%20Compilation.pdf |archivedate=April 28, 2016 }}</ref> The settlement of \"Upper Yonge Street\" sprouted up around the mill, which explains why its primary downtown area was centred on the Holland River, and not on Yonge Street which is some distance to the west. Hill also built a [[Tanning (leather)|tannery]] just to the north of the mill, and the first general store and house, as well as additional mills.\n\nBy 1802, [[Elisha Beman]], who owned a great deal of land in the area, had begun to establish businesses.<ref name=\"ontarioplaques.com\"/> A mill was first and other businesses (including a [[distillery]]) soon followed. Mordecai Millar also built mills and Joseph Hill opened a tannery. During the [[War of 1812]] a resident, William Roe, was able to hide gold that was in the settlement's treasury, saving it from invading American troops. The war also helped bring some prosperity as the army purchased goods and food and hired locals to build structures.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Carter |first1=Robert Terence |title=Stories of Newmarket: An Old Ontario Town |publisher=Dundurn |page=76 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=IKwo5Fb7_YUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Newmarket,+ontario+war+of+1812&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjI18aZt8fTAhVBw4MKHbG6DQ8Q6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&q=war%20of%201812&f=false |accessdate=13 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nBy 1814, the settlement had two frame and several log buildings used as residences.<ref name=\"electriccanadian.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.electriccanadian.com/history/ontario/york/part03chap11.htm |title=History of Toronto and County of York in Ontario Part III: Town of Newmarket |accessdate=April 28, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170819060727/http://www.electriccanadian.com/history/ontario/york/part03chap11.htm |archivedate=August 19, 2017 }}</ref> The town continued to grow through the early 19th century, along with the formation of [[Aurora, Ontario|Aurora]] and [[Holland Landing, Ontario|Holland Landing]], and a market held in the current downtown location gave rise to the name \"Newmarket\".\n\nNewmarket played a central role in the [[Rebellions of 1837\u20131838]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cfha.info/journal77p57.pdf |title=The War of 1812-14 and the Rebellion of 1837 from \u201cThe Story of Sharon\u201d |accessdate=April 28, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180501154110/http://cfha.info/journal77p57.pdf |archivedate=May 1, 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The Rebellion of 1837 in Upper Canada : a collection of documents |year=1985 |publisher=Champlain Society in cooperation with the Ontario Heritage Foundation |isbn=0-88629-026-0 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/rebellionof1837i0000unse/page/182 182]\u2013186 |edition=Second Printing |url=https://archive.org/details/rebellionof1837i0000unse |url-access=registration |quote=Newmarket . |accessdate=13 November 2018}}</ref> The town was a focal point of discontent against the manipulations of the governing Family Compact, of whom it was said \"were robbing the country\". Rebel leader [[William Lyon Mackenzie]] organized a series of meetings leading to the Rebellion. During the first of these meetings, on August 3, 1837, Mackenzie delivered his first campaign speech from the veranda of the North American Hotel at the corner of Botsford and Main Streets. This speech is largely credited for being the spark to the rebellion as it was heard by about 600 farmers and others sympathetic to Mackenzie\u2019s cause, who later that year armed themselves and marched down Yonge St. to take the capital. A number of leaders from this area were [[Attainder|attainted]] for [[high treason]], convicted and [[Hanging|hanged]].<ref>{{cite book |title=History of Toronto and County of York, Ontario |year=1885 |publisher=C.

Much of the settlement was built on the south side of the village. Many farms surrounded the village. There were six churches or chapels, a post office, five stores, three taverns and tradesmen of various types. Industry included two grist-mills, two breweries, a distillery, one tannery, a foundry, a carding machine, and a cloth factory.<ref>{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Wm.

Some years later, his sash and door factory would become the first Canadian manufacturer of lead pencils, the Dixon Pencil Company.<ref name=\"ontarioplaques.com\"/>\n\nIn 1869, the population was 1500 and a gazetteer described Newmarket as one of the most flourishing villages on the Northern Railway line.

The [[Newmarket Canal]] was almost complete by the summer of 1912, when it was cancelled by the incoming government of [[Robert Borden]].

By the 1950s, Newmarket was experiencing a suburban building boom due to its proximity to Toronto. The population increased from 5,000 to 11,000 between 1950 and 1970.\n\nThe [[Regional Municipality of York]] was formed in 1971, increasing the size of Newmarket with land from the Township of East Gwillimbury, from the Township of King and from the Township of Whitchurch. \n<ref name=\"newmarket.ca\"/> The construction of [[Upper Canada Mall]] at the corner of Yonge Street and Davis Drive in 1974 started pulling the focal point of the town westward from the historic Downtown area along Main Street.\n\nBy the early 1980s, the historic Downtown area suffered as most businesses had built up in the area around Upper Canada Mall, with additional [[strip mall]]s developing directly across the Yonge Street/Davis Drive intersection to the south and southeast. A concerted effort to revitalize the historic Downtown area during the late 1980s was successful. More recently, a $2.3-million investment was made by the town in 2004 in streetscaping and infrastructure improvements to roads and sidewalks in the historic Downtown.

The southern boundary of the town is contiguous with [[Aurora, Ontario|Aurora]] to the south.\n\nArmitage was the first settlement of [[King, Ontario|King]] township, named in honour of its first settler Amos Armitage.<ref name=\"Carter\" /><!-- page 50 --> He had been recruited by Timothy Rogers, a [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] from [[Vermont]], who in 1801 had travelled along [[Yonge Street]] and found the area appealing, and so applied for and received a grant for land totalling 40 farms, each of {{convert|200|acre|km2|1}}.\n\nOther defunct communities once located within the modern boundaries of Newmarket include Garbut's Hill, Paddytown, Petchville, Pleasantville, and White Rose.<ref name=\"Carter\" /><!-- page 51-52 -->\n\n== Geography ==\nNewmarket's geographical coordinates are 44.05\u00b0N, 79.46\u00b0W, and its elevation above [[sea level]] is 252&nbsp;m.<ref>{{cite web |title=Newmarket, Canada Page |url=http://www.fallingrain.com/world/CA/08/Newmarket.html |publisher=Falling Rain Software, Ltd. |accessdate=13 November 2018}}</ref> It has an area of 38.33&nbsp;km\u00b2. The town is bounded on the south by [[Aurora, Ontario|Aurora]], on the west by [[King, Ontario|King]], on the north by [[East Gwillimbury]] and on the east by [[Whitchurch\u2013Stouffville]].\n\nThe main river in Newmarket is the [[East Holland River]] (known locally simply as \"The [[Holland River]]\"), and all other streams in the town are tributaries thereto. These include Bogart Creek, a brook that weaves its way into the town from the [[Oak Ridges Moraine]] by way of [[Bogarttown, Ontario|Bogarttown]], emptying into the Holland River in north-central Newmarket; Western creek, another brook rising just west of the town, and reaching the Holland River in the town's north end; Tannery Creek, a stream that joins the Holland River in south Newmarket after flowing through [[Aurora, Ontario|Aurora]]; and a number of other small watercourses.\n\nThere are two [[reservoir]]s in Newmarket; Fairy Lake (which is managed by the [[Lake Simcoe Region Conservation Authority]]), a favourite recreational area in the centre of town, is a former [[mill pond]] on the East Holland River; and Bogart Pond, also a former mill pond, is fed and drained by Bogart Creek in Bogarttown. Furthermore, the water level in the reach of the East Holland north of Davis Drive is controlled from an unfinished [[Newmarket Canal]] lock, now used as a [[weir]].\n\nNewmarket also lies south of and above the [[Glacial Lake Algonquin|Algonquin Shoreline]], where elevations suddenly drop off from the gently rolling hills that characterize much of Newmarket to the much flatter, lower land down below in the [[Holland Marsh]].\n\nThe land is characterized mainly by [[till|glacial deposits]] from the last [[ice age]], known as \"Newmarket Till\". The town is underlain mainly by sand and gravel, ground by the [[Ice sheet|icesheets]] that covered the area until about 10,000 years ago. No [[outcrop]]s are to be found anywhere in Newmarket, so deep are the glacial deposits.\n\n== Climate ==\nNewmarket has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Humid continental climate#Koppen Dfb|K\u00f6ppen climate classification ''Dfb'']]), with four distinct seasons featuring cold, somewhat snowy winters and warm, humid summers. Precipitation is moderate and consistent in all seasons, although summers are a bit wetter than winter due to the moisture from the Gulf of Mexico and the Great Lakes.\n\n{{Weather box\n| collapsed    = yes\n| metric first = yes\n| single line  = yes\n| location     = Newmarket/King Smoke Tree &ndash; 1981&ndash;2010{{efn|Dates may vary.

Denison Secondary School]], [[Huron Heights Secondary School]], [[Newmarket High School]], and [[Sir William Mulock Secondary School]], in addition to 15 elementary schools.\n\nThe YCDSB operates one secondary school in the town: [[Sacred Heart Catholic High School (Newmarket)|Sacred Heart Catholic High School]], and six elementary schools. There is also a Christian private elementary school, Newmarket District Christian Academy (NDCA).\n\nNewmarket is also the home of [[Pickering College]], an independent day and boarding school, as well as a campus of [[Seneca College]].\n\n== Local government ==\nJohn Taylor was elected in October 2018 to become mayor, succeeding [[Tony Van Bynen]] who was [[List of mayors of Newmarket, Ontario|mayor]] from 2006 to 2018. (See [[List of mayors of Newmarket, Ontario|list of previous mayors]])\n\nThe town's council includes a mayor, seven councillors elected on the basis of one per ward, and a regional councillor who is elected to join the mayor at meetings of [[York Regional Council]].

The province realigned its ridings to match those of the federal government in 2004.\n\nFederally, Newmarket is part of the riding of [[Electoral district (Canada)|federal riding]] of [[Newmarket\u2014Aurora]]. The riding is represented in the [[House of Commons of Canada]] by [[Kyle Peterson (politician)|Kyle Peterson]], a member of the [[Liberal Party of Canada]], who was first elected in the [[2015 Canadian federal election|2015 federal election]].\n\n==Policing==\n\nThe [[York Regional Police]] is the primary police agency in Newmarket. [[Ontario Provincial Police]] patrol on provincially maintained highways in Newmarket like [[Highway 404 (Ontario)|Highway 404]].\n\nThe [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] North Toronto Detachment is located in Newmarket.\n\n== Urban planning ==\n\nThe part of Newmarket built before [[World War II]] surrounding Main Street is very typical of a small Ontario city, in terms of walkability and mixes of use.  Other areas of the town are typical of post-war development commonly found throughout many suburban areas.\n\nNewmarket is identified as one of the Golden Horseshoe's 25 Urban Growth Centres in Ontario's Places to Grow Growth Plan.<ref name=Placestogrow>{{cite web|url=http://www.newmarket.ca/userfiles/page_attachments/Library/1/3107712_Newmarket_OP___Consolidated_Modifications___2008_04___Regional_Approval.pdf|format=PDF|title= Town of Newmarket 2-2006 Official Plan|date=October 10, 2006|publisher=Town of Newmarket|accessdate=August 25, 2008}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>\n\nFour areas of Newmarket have been selected to absorb the majority of planned population growth and accommodate mixed usages on sites well served by transit.

The library also runs the York Info service, which provides information about local organizations, groups and services, and helps develop a stronger volunteer presence in the community by connecting people who would like to volunteer with non-profit agencies looking for assistance. The library also produces a quarterly newsletter called \"Off the Shelf\" to inform patrons of its programs, services and events. The library is a founding member of the Shared Digital Infrastructure (SDI) project, an initiative to plan for an Intelligent Community in Newmarket.\n\n== Theatre ==\n* The Newmarket Theatre is the largest performing arts theatre in the town, with a capacity of 400. It hosts a selection of world class artists annually.\n* The Resurgence Theatre Company is a smaller professional company that is focused on resurging the classics and igniting new and contemporary works within York Region and beyond. The company produces an annual Shakespearean production with live performances in the Fairy Lake Conservation Area near the historic Downtown.\n* Old Town Hall has hosted organized theatre and performing arts for over 100 years, and in March 2012 the Town of Newmarket announced that a formal 250-seat theatre would be included as part of its revitalization. Construction on this initiative started in May 2013 and was expected to be complete in the fall of 2016.\n\n== Sports and recreation ==\n\n=== Hockey ===\nNewmarket was previously home to the following teams:\n* [[ Newmarket Hurricanes ]] from 1987 to 2019, an [[Ontario Provincial Junior A Hockey League]]. The franchise was moved to [[ Milton, Ontario ]] and renamed to the [[Milton Menace]].<ref>{{cite web |title=UPDATE: Junior A Hurricanes are skating out of Newmarket |url=https://www.yorkregion.com/news-story/9245956-update-junior-a-hurricanes-are-skating-out-of-newmarket/ |website=yorkregion.com |publisher=Torstar |accessdate=22 August 2019}}</ref>\n* [[Newmarket Saints]] from 1986 to 1991, an American Hockey League franchise and [[farm team]] of the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] who moved from [[St. Catharines]]. The franchise was later moved to [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's, Newfoundland]] and became the [[St. John's Maple Leafs]].\n* [[Newmarket Royals]] from 1992 to 1994. This was a franchise of the [[Ontario Hockey League]] who were previously the [[Cornwall Royals]] and in 1994 moved again to become the [[Sarnia Sting]].\n* Newmarket Flyers from 1975 to 1986, OPJHL Jr. A (formerly The Seneca Flyers).\n* Newmarket Redmen from late 1920s to 1972 Jr. B.\n\nJunior Leagues\nNewmarket is also home to many rep and select teams. They go by the name of the Newmarket Redmen and range from divisions of Tyke to Midget.\n\n=== Golf ===\nOne golf course is located within Newmarket's town limits; St. Andrew's Valley (a public club), which straddles the Aurora/Newmarket border. Glenway Country Club was a private club with a course within Newmarket's boundaries, but it was closed before the 2012 season and is slated for redevelopment.<ref>{{cite web|last=Latchford|first=Teresa|title=Glenway won\u2019t reopen in 2012|url=http://www.yorkregion.com/article/1059739--glenway-won-t-reopen-in-2012|work=Yorkregion.com|publisher=Metroland News|accessdate=November 13, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThere are also several courses in the surrounding communities and countryside.\n\n=== Swimming ===\nThree public swimming places exist throughout Newmarket: [[Ray Twinney Complex]], Gorman Pool, which is open only in the summer, and the Magna Centre.\n\n=== Curling ===\nNewmarket is home to the [[List of curling clubs in Ontario#Zone 7|York Curling Club]].\n\n== Media ==\n=== Print ===\nLocal print media is provided by ''[[The Newmarket Era]]'' (formerly the ''Era Banner''). The paper traces its lineage back to 1852, when English immigrant printer G.S. Porter first published ''The New Era'' in Newmarket. Today, it is published twice a week (Thursday and Sunday).\n\n=== Radio ===\nNewmarket is well served by [[Media in Toronto#Radio|radio stations from Toronto]].\n\n== Arms ==\n[[Image:NewmarketONCoA.gif|thumb|Newmarket's coat of arms]]\n\nNewmarket's [[coat of arms]] is actually taken from the town's old corporate seal. The town [[flag]] is a navy blue field with this same design in the middle. The beehive and bees are said to represent industry. There are nine bees, representing the town's nine most prominent businesses at the time that Newmarket was incorporated as a Village.<ref>{{cite web |title=Museum FAQ |url=https://www.newmarket.ca/ThingsToDo/Pages/Recreation%20and%20Culture/Elman%20W.%20Campbell%20Museum/Museum-FAQ.aspx |website=Town of Newmarket |accessdate=2 August 2019}}</ref> The latest form of the [[Seal (device)|seal]] was introduced in 1938 with the arms somewhat altered from&nbsp;\u2013 but very similar in concept to&nbsp;\u2013 one that was earlier used.

A bawdy, jazzy tune, the song describes a laundry woman from [[Harlem]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[United States]], whose technique is so unusual that people come from all around just to watch her scrub. [[The Andrews Sisters]] and [[Will Bradley]] & His Orchestra recorded the most successful pop versions of the song, but it is today best recognized as the centerpiece of an eponymous [[Walter Lantz Studio]] cartoon from 1941.\n\n==Animated short==\n\n===Production===\nThe short version, released on March 28, 1941, by [[Universal Pictures]], features no director credit (although [[Woody Woodpecker]] creator [[Walter Lantz]] claims to have directed the cartoon himself), with a story by [[Ben Hardaway]], animation by [[Alex Lovy]] and Frank Tipper, and voiceover work by [[Mel Blanc]] and [[Nellie Lutcher]]. The short uses [[blackface]] stereotypes based upon [[Africans]] in the rural [[Southern United States]].\n\nThe \"Scrub Me Mama\" short is today in the [[public domain]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://publicdomainmovies.net/movie/scrub-me-mama-with-a-boogie-beat-1941 | title=SCRUB ME MAMA WITH A BOOGIE BEAT (1941) | accessdate=2016-12-17}}</ref> Clips from it are featured in [[Spike Lee]]'s 2000 satirical film about African-American stereotypes, ''[[Bamboozled]]''.\n\n===Plot===\nThe short opens to an orchestral rendition of [[Stephen Foster]]'s \"[[Old Folks at Home]]\", immediately setting the scene in the rural [[Southern United States|South]] of [[blackface]] [[Minstrel show|minstrelsy]]. The setting is Lazy Town, perhaps the laziest place on earth. Neither the town's residents (all stereotypes of African-Americans) nor the animals can be bothered to leave their reclining positions to do anything at all. Their pastoral existence is interrupted by the arrival of a [[riverboat]], carrying a svelte, sophisticated, light-skinned woman from Harlem (who bears a resemblance to [[Lena Horne]]<ref name=\"cbr-20171127\"/>), whose physical beauty inspires the entire populace of an all-black \"Lazy Town\" to spring into action.\n\nThe visiting urbanite admonishes one of the town's residents her mother, \"Listen, Mammy. That ain't no way to wash clothes! What you all need is rhythm!\"  She then proceeds to sing \"Scrub Me Mama with a Boogie Beat\", which the townsfolk slowly join her in performing. Thus begins a montage which is the short's centerpiece. The townsfolk are infected by the song's rhythm and proceed to go about playing instruments, and  dancing suggestively. By the time the young light-skinned lady from Harlem is due to get on her riverboat and return home, she has succeeded in turning a dark-skinned Lazy Town into a lively community of swing musicians simply by singing. The cartoon concludes with the mammy washerwoman bending over, displaying the words \"The End\" across her buttocks.\n\n===Bans===\nThis cartoon has been withheld from distribution by Universal since 1949 due to its negative stereotypical portrayal of African-Americans. The decision was made after a strong objection was raised by the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]] upon the short's re-issue in 1948. The entire short was a shock to Lantz, who prided himself on avoiding problems with the censors. He repeatedly stated that his cartoons were never meant to offend anyone. After the 1948 decision, Lantz made a major effort to make sure that offensive caricatures of any racial or ethnic group would never appear in his cartoons again. He also personally made sure that ''Scrub Me Mama'' would never be distributed on television, although it was broadcast in several [[European countries]] such as: [[Ireland]], [[France]] and [[Spain]].<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://lantz.goldenagecartoons.com/1941.html\n |title       = The Walter Lantz Cartune Encyclopedia: 1941\n |accessdate  = 2013-06-01\n |publisher   = The Walter Lantz Cartune Encyclopedia\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120523214258/http://lantz.goldenagecartoons.com/1941.html\n |archivedate = 2012-05-23\n}}</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallery\n|title=Screen from short version\n|width=160 | height=170\n|align=center\n|footer=\n|File:Scrub Me Mama watermelon.JPG\n |alt1=\n |A character from the film [[Watermelon stereotype|eating watermelon]].\n|File:Scrub Me Mama capture 1.JPG\n |alt2=\n |The dark-skinned residents of Lazy Town are excited upon the arrival of the unnamed light-skinned woman.\n}}\n\n==Controversy==\nThe short was re-released in 1948. On October 20, 1948, the NAACP wrote a letter to [[Universal Studios]]. It objected to the \"vicious caricature of Negro life in the South\". They found the short to depict Black people as lazy and only activated by swing music. They also objected to the images of scantily clad, dancing young women. They requested the end of distribution for the film and better judgment from Universal.<ref name=\"Cohen2\">Cohen (2004), pp. 51-53.</ref>\n\nOn October 29, 1948, a representative of Universal wrote to the NAACP. He pointed out that none of the company's theaters had received complaints concerning the film. A few days later, on November 3, 1948, Madison Jones, Jr, who represented the NAACP, met with E.L. McEvoy, the Universal short sales distribution chief, at the New York City office of the studio. McEvoy defended the racist humor of the film. Jones responded that the NAACP was holding an education campaign against this type of humor.<ref name=\"Cohen2\"/>\n\nMcEvoy offered to let the NAACP contact the West Coast offices of the company, but he warned that in consequence for taking action, \"[[nigger]]s\" would be prevented from getting work in the industry. He also claimed the NAACP members were better educated than the average audience member, who would not object to seeing racist images. Jones responded that this was a reason to avoid the racist films, that the audience might think them to be based on fact.<ref name=\"Cohen2\"/>\n\nMcEvoy pointed out that caricatures of Negroes, [[Stereotypes of Jews|Jews]], Germans, and [[Stage Irish|Irish]] used to all be top entertainment. He emphasized that the office language at Universal also included the terms \"[[Sheeny|sheenie]]\" and \"[[kike]]\" (both used for Jews).<ref name=\"Cohen2\"/> He noted that the film had only been re-released since the Walter Lantz Studio had temporarily shut down (and stopped producing new content).<ref name=\"Cohen2\"/>\n\nOn November 20, 1948, the ''[[Los Angeles Tribune]]'' published an article on the complaints of the NAACP.

A bawdy, jazzy tune, the song describes a laundry woman from [[Harlem]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[United States]], whose technique is so unusual that people come from all around just to watch her scrub. [[The Andrews Sisters]] and [[Will Bradley]] & His Orchestra recorded the most successful pop versions of the song, but it is today best recognized as the centerpiece of an eponymous [[Walter Lantz Studio]] cartoon from 1941.\n\n==Animated short==\n\n===Production===\nThe short version, released on March 28, 1941, by [[Universal Pictures]], features no director credit (although [[Woody Woodpecker]] creator [[Walter Lantz]] claims to have directed the cartoon himself), with a story by [[Ben Hardaway]], animation by [[Alex Lovy]] and Frank Tipper, and voiceover work by [[Mel Blanc]] and [[Nellie Lutcher]]. The short uses [[blackface]] stereotypes based upon [[Africans]] in the rural [[Southern United States]].\n\nThe \"Scrub Me Mama\" short is today in the [[public domain]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://publicdomainmovies.net/movie/scrub-me-mama-with-a-boogie-beat-1941 | title=SCRUB ME MAMA WITH A BOOGIE BEAT (1941) | accessdate=2016-12-17}}</ref> Clips from it are featured in [[Spike Lee]]'s 2000 satirical film about African-American stereotypes, ''[[Bamboozled]]''. The film's setting, Lazy Town, is not to be confused with the [[LazyTown|Icelandic children's television program of the same name]].\n\n===Plot===\nThe short opens to an orchestral rendition of [[Stephen Foster]]'s \"[[Old Folks at Home]]\", immediately setting the scene in the rural [[Southern United States|South]] of [[blackface]] [[Minstrel show|minstrelsy]]. The setting is Lazy Town, perhaps the laziest place on earth. Neither the town's residents (all stereotypes of African-Americans) nor the animals can be bothered to leave their reclining positions to do anything at all. Their pastoral existence is interrupted by the arrival of a [[riverboat]], carrying a svelte, sophisticated, light-skinned woman from Harlem (who bears a resemblance to [[Lena Horne]]<ref name=\"cbr-20171127\"/>), whose physical beauty inspires the entire populace of an all-black \"Lazy Town\" to spring into action.\n\nThe visiting urbanite admonishes one of the town's residents her mother, \"Listen, Mammy. That ain't no way to wash clothes! What you all need is rhythm!\"  She then proceeds to sing \"Scrub Me Mama with a Boogie Beat\", which the townsfolk slowly join her in performing. Thus begins a montage which is the short's centerpiece. The townsfolk are infected by the song's rhythm and proceed to go about playing instruments, and  dancing suggestively. By the time the young light-skinned lady from Harlem is due to get on her riverboat and return home, she has succeeded in turning a dark-skinned Lazy Town into a lively community of swing musicians simply by singing. The cartoon concludes with the mammy washerwoman bending over, displaying the words \"The End\" across her buttocks.\n\n===Bans===\nThis cartoon has been withheld from distribution by Universal since 1949 due to its negative stereotypical portrayal of African-Americans. The decision was made after a strong objection was raised by the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]] upon the short's re-issue in 1948. The entire short was a shock to Lantz, who prided himself on avoiding problems with the censors. He repeatedly stated that his cartoons were never meant to offend anyone. After the 1948 decision, Lantz made a major effort to make sure that offensive caricatures of any racial or ethnic group would never appear in his cartoons again. He also personally made sure that ''Scrub Me Mama'' would never be distributed on television, although it was broadcast in several [[European countries]] such as: [[Ireland]], [[France]] and [[Spain]].<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://lantz.goldenagecartoons.com/1941.html\n |title       = The Walter Lantz Cartune Encyclopedia: 1941\n |accessdate  = 2013-06-01\n |publisher   = The Walter Lantz Cartune Encyclopedia\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120523214258/http://lantz.goldenagecartoons.com/1941.html\n |archivedate = 2012-05-23\n}}</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallery\n|title=Screen from short version\n|width=160 | height=170\n|align=center\n|footer=\n|File:Scrub Me Mama watermelon.JPG\n |alt1=\n |A character from the film [[Watermelon stereotype|eating watermelon]].\n|File:Scrub Me Mama capture 1.JPG\n |alt2=\n |The dark-skinned residents of Lazy Town are excited upon the arrival of the unnamed light-skinned woman.\n}}\n\n==Controversy==\nThe short was re-released in 1948. On October 20, 1948, the NAACP wrote a letter to [[Universal Studios]]. It objected to the \"vicious caricature of Negro life in the South\". They found the short to depict Black people as lazy and only activated by swing music. They also objected to the images of scantily clad, dancing young women. They requested the end of distribution for the film and better judgment from Universal.<ref name=\"Cohen2\">Cohen (2004), pp. 51-53.</ref>\n\nOn October 29, 1948, a representative of Universal wrote to the NAACP. He pointed out that none of the company's theaters had received complaints concerning the film. A few days later, on November 3, 1948, Madison Jones, Jr, who represented the NAACP, met with E.L. McEvoy, the Universal short sales distribution chief, at the New York City office of the studio. McEvoy defended the racist humor of the film. Jones responded that the NAACP was holding an education campaign against this type of humor.<ref name=\"Cohen2\"/>\n\nMcEvoy offered to let the NAACP contact the West Coast offices of the company, but he warned that in consequence for taking action, \"[[nigger]]s\" would be prevented from getting work in the industry. He also claimed the NAACP members were better educated than the average audience member, who would not object to seeing racist images. Jones responded that this was a reason to avoid the racist films, that the audience might think them to be based on fact.<ref name=\"Cohen2\"/>\n\nMcEvoy pointed out that caricatures of Negroes, [[Stereotypes of Jews|Jews]], Germans, and [[Stage Irish|Irish]] used to all be top entertainment. He emphasized that the office language at Universal also included the terms \"[[Sheeny|sheenie]]\" and \"[[kike]]\" (both used for Jews).<ref name=\"Cohen2\"/> He noted that the film had only been re-released since the Walter Lantz Studio had temporarily shut down (and stopped producing new content).<ref name=\"Cohen2\"/>\n\nOn November 20, 1948, the ''[[Los Angeles Tribune]]'' published an article on the complaints of the NAACP. On February 3, 1949, Universal announced in a press release that the studio was withdrawing the film, following the protest. A memo dated February 19, 1949, revealed that the [[Jewish Labor Committee]] had co-operated with the NAACP in protesting the film.<ref name=\"Cohen2\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Censored Eleven]]\n* [[List of films in the public domain in the United States]]\n\n== References ==\n<references>\n<ref name=\"cbr-20171127\">Tom Chapman. \"[https://www.cbr.com/offensive-classic-cartoons-that-should-be-censored/ 15 Classic Cartoons That Would Definitely Be Censored Today]\", cbr.com, 27 November 2017.
