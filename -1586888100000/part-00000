The [[Government of the United Kingdom|government]] and [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] are responsible for [[reserved and excepted matters]]. Reserved matters are a list of policy areas (such as [[civil aviation]], [[units of measurement]], and [[human genetics]]), which the Westminster Parliament may devolve to the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] at some time in future. Excepted matters (such as [[international relations]], taxation and elections) are never expected to be considered for devolution. On all other matters, the [[Northern Ireland Executive]] together with the 90-member Northern Ireland Assembly may legislate and govern for Northern Ireland. Additionally, devolution in Northern Ireland is dependent upon participation by members of the Northern Ireland Executive in the [[North/South Ministerial Council]], which co-ordinates areas of co-operation (such as agriculture, education and health) between Northern Ireland and the [[Republic of Ireland]].\n[[Image:StormontGeneral.jpg|thumb|left|[[Parliament Buildings (Northern Ireland)|Parliament Buildings]] at [[Parliament Buildings (Northern Ireland)|Stormont]], Belfast, seat of the assembly]]\nElections to the Northern Ireland Assembly are by [[single transferable vote]] with five representatives (Members of the Legislative Assembly, MLAs) elected from 18 [[List of parliamentary constituencies in Northern Ireland|parliamentary constituencies]]. Eighteen representatives to the lower house of the British parliament (Members of Parliament, MPs) are elected from the same constituencies using the [[First-past-the-post voting|first-past-the-post]] system. However, not all of these take their seats. The seven [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] MPs refuse to take the required [[Oath of Allegiance (United Kingdom)|oath to serve]] [[Queen Elizabeth II]]. In addition, the upper house of the UK's parliament, the [[House of Lords]], currently has some 25 appointed [[List of Northern Ireland members of the House of Lords|members from Northern Ireland]]. Northern Ireland itself forms [[Northern Ireland (European Parliament constituency)|a single constituency]] for elections to the [[European Union]].\n\nThe [[Northern Ireland Office]] represents the British government in Northern Ireland on reserved matters. The [[Government of the Republic of Ireland]] also has the right to \"put forward views and proposals\" on non-devolved matters in relation to Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland Office is led by the [[Secretary of State for Northern Ireland]], who sits in the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom]].\n\nMuch of the population of Northern Ireland identifies with one of two different ideologies: [[Unionism in Ireland|unionism]] (which wants the region to remain part of the United Kingdom) and [[Irish nationalism]] (which wants a [[united Ireland]]). Unionists are predominantly [[Ulster Protestant]], most of whom belong to the [[Presbyterian Church in Ireland]] and the [[Church of Ireland]]. Irish nationalists are almost wholly [[Roman Catholic]]. There is also a small minority of [[Ulster nationalism|Ulster nationalists]] (those who want an independent Northern Irish state), whose religious convictions vary.\n\n==Political representation==\nNorthern Ireland currently has the following political representation:\n* the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] has 90 [[Member of the Legislative Assembly|Members of the Legislative Assembly]] (MLAs) (currently 40 [[Unionism in Ireland|unionists]], 40 [[Irish nationalism|nationalists]], 10 others [constitutionally neutral]), which had its powers restored on 8 May 2007.\n* 18 seats in the United Kingdom [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] (currently 8 unionist MPs, 9 nationalist MPs and 1 neutral MP)<ref>Due to the abstentionist nature of Sinn F\u00e9in MPs, the fact that the [[Church of Ireland]] was [[Disestablishmentarianism|disestablished]] in 1871, meaning the church no longer sends representatives to the House of Lords (unlike the [[Church of England]], which continues to send two [[archbishop]]s and 24 bishops, known as [[Lords Spiritual]]), as well as the fact that bishops of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] are not represented, this has resulted in most Northern Ireland members of [[House of Lords]] (such as [[Eileen Paisley]] and [[David Trimble]]&nbsp;\u2014 see [[List of Northern Ireland Members of the House of Lords]]) coming from Unionist backgrounds by default. In July 2009 [[Nuala O'Loan]], who is married to the SDLP MLA [[Declan O'Loan]], was appointed by [[Gordon Brown]] to this legislative body. The late [[Gerry Fitt]], the first leader of the nationalist [[Social Democratic and Labour Party|SDLP]], sat from 1983 until 2005.</ref>\n* there are several unionists but no nationalists on the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom]] (see [[List of Northern Ireland members of the Privy Council]]).\n* at local level there are 11 [[Local government in Northern Ireland|district councils]]\n\n===Voting patterns===\n\nVoting patterns break down as follows:\n*[[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 Westminster election]] \u2013 unionists 43.2%, nationalists 38.9%, others 17.9%\n*[[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 Westminster election]] \u2013 unionists 49.2%, nationalists 41.2%, others 9.6%\n*[[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 Westminster election]] \u2013 unionists 50.2%, nationalists 38.5%, others 11.2%\n*[[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 Westminster election]] \u2013 unionists 50.5%, nationalists 42.0%, others 7.5%\n*[[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 Westminster election]] \u2013 unionists 51.4%, nationalists 41.8%, others 6.8%\n*[[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 Westminster election]] \u2013 unionists 52.9%, nationalists 42.7%, others 4.4%\n*[[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 Westminster election]] \u2013 unionists 50.5%, nationalists 40.2%, others 9.3%\n\n\n*[[2019 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|2019 European election]] \u2013 unionists 42.9%, nationalists 35.9%, others 21.2%\n*[[2014 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|2014 European election]] \u2013 unionists 51.0%, nationalists 38.6%, others 10.5%\n*[[2009 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|2009 European election]] \u2013 unionists 49.0%, nationalists 42.2%, others 8.8%\n*[[2004 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|2004 European election]] \u2013 unionists 48.6%, nationalists 42.2%, others 9.2%\n*[[1999 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|1999 European election]] \u2013 unionists 52.3%, nationalists 45.4%, others 2.3%\n\n\n*[[2017 Northern Ireland Assembly election|2017 Assembly election]] \u2013 unionists 44.8%, nationalists 40.0%, others 15.5%\n*[[2016 Northern Ireland Assembly election|2016 Assembly election]] \u2013 unionists 48.5%, nationalists 36.4%, others 15.1%\n*[[2011 Northern Ireland Assembly election|2011 Assembly election]] \u2013 unionists 48.3%, nationalists 41.5%, others 10.2%\n*[[2007 Northern Ireland Assembly election|2007 Assembly election]] \u2013 unionists 48.6%, nationalists 42.0%, others 9.4%\n*[[2003 Northern Ireland Assembly election|2003 Assembly election]] \u2013 unionists 52.1%, nationalists 40.5%, others 7.4%\n*[[1998 Northern Ireland Assembly election|1998 Assembly election]] \u2013 unionists 50.6%, nationalists 39.7%, others 9.7%\n\n{{Wide image|Vote Share Northern Ireland Elections.png|1000px|Shows the percentage of votes, or first preference votes, cast for unionist, nationalist and other candidates in elections in Northern Ireland.}}\n\n{{Wide image|NI Assembly seat share by designation.svg|800px|Shows the proportion of seats obtained at each election to the Northern Ireland Assembly by those members designated as unionist, those members designated as nationalist and those members designated as other.}}\n\n{{Wide image|Northern Ireland election seats 1997-2019.svg|1000px|Results in Northern Ireland from UK general elections}}\n\n===Electoral systems===\nIn all elections in Northern Ireland the [[single transferable vote]] system of [[proportional representation]] is used except for the House of Commons elections where a \"first past the post\" or [[plurality voting system]] is used.\n\n===Proposed representation in the Republic===\n[[Sinn F\u00e9in]], currently the biggest of the nationalist parties in Northern Ireland, has campaigned for a broadening of the franchise of Northern Ireland voters to allow them to vote in elections to choose the [[President of Ireland]]. It had also demanded that all Northern Ireland [[Member of the European Parliament|Members of the European Parliament]] (MEPs) and MPs be allowed speaking rights in the lower house of the parliament of the Republic of Ireland, [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]]. It was given to understand that the [[Irish government]] accepted this and had plans to introduce legislation in the autumn of 2005.<ref>{{cite web|author=01/08/2005 \u2013 14:17:53 |url=http://breaking.tcm.ie/2005/08/01/story214291.html |title=Sinn F\u00e9in hails D\u00e1il speaking rights plan &#124; BreakingNews.ie |publisher=Breaking.tcm.ie |date= |accessdate=16 March 2010}}</ref> The [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] (SDLP) backed the move. However, a spokesman for [[Taoiseach]] [[Bertie Ahern]] later rowed back, stating that it had never been intended that the MPs have a right to attend plenary sessions of the D\u00e1il, but that they would be invited to participate in [[Oireachtas]] committees dealing with Northern Ireland matters, and only if there was all-party agreement behind it. The unionist parties, along with [[Fine Gael]], [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour]] and the [[Progressive Democrats]] have all declared their opposition to the move, as has much of the Irish media, with articles highly critical of the proposal published in ''[[The Irish Times]]'' and the ''[[Sunday Independent (Ireland)|Sunday Independent]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unison.ie/irish_independent/stories.php3?ca=9&si=1446370&issue_id=12836 |title=Adams, stay out of our House&nbsp;\u2014 National News, Frontpage&nbsp;\u2014 Independent.ie |publisher=Unison.ie |author=The haunting |date= |accessdate=28 October 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unison.ie/irish_independent/stories.php3?ca=36&si=1450453&issue_id=12866 |title=How Adams got it wrong on speaking in the D\u00e1il&nbsp;\u2014 Analysis&nbsp;\u2014 Independent.ie |publisher=Unison.ie |author=The haunting |date= |accessdate=28 October 2008}}</ref> Nonetheless on 22 November 2007, representatives from both Sinn F\u00e9in and the SDLP, (unionists declined the invitation) attended a meeting of the Oireachtas committee reviewing the workings of the Good Friday Agreement.

Until 1972 the UUP's members of the [[British House of Commons]] took the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] [[whip (politics)|whip]], but currently sit as a party in their own right. The UUP's member of the European Parliament had belonged to the [[European Conservatives and Reformists]] Group.\n\nThe DUP are a more complex mixture than the other major parties, combining support from rural [[evangelicals]] and urban, secular, working class voters. The party is firmly to the right on issues such as abortion, capital punishment, [[European integration]] and [[equal opportunities]], although it seems to be moderating its stance on [[gay rights]] since the \"[[Save Ulster from Sodomy]]\" campaign of the 1980s. Conversely, the DUP often support social programmes which benefit their working class or agricultural base, for example, [[free public transport]] for the elderly and [[European Union]] [[agricultural subsidies]]. The DUP have grown in recent years as they were originally the only major party to oppose the [[Good Friday Agreement]], although until September 2015 they were part of a government operating it.\n\nThe smaller, left-leaning [[Progressive Unionist Party]] and [[Ulster Political Research Group]] are linked with the [[Ulster Volunteer Force]] and [[Ulster Defence Association]] respectively.\n\n===Nationalist parties===\n[[File:Funeral of Martin McGuinness (2).jpg|thumb|The funeral procession of Sinn F\u00e9in politician [[Martin McGuinness]], Londonderry, 2017]]\nSimilarly, on the nationalist side of the political spectrum, Sinn F\u00e9in has overtaken the traditionally dominant SDLP in recent elections. Sinn F\u00e9in is a left-wing [[Irish republican]] party, committed to espousing an [[United Ireland|all-Ireland]] republic. Traditionally the party of the urban Catholic working class and a number of republican rural areas, since the IRA ceasefires of the mid-1990s it has expanded its base considerably and has overtaken the long-dominant SDLP in terms of vote share.\n\nThe SDLP are a nominally [[social democratic]] party and a full member of the [[Party of European Socialists]] and [[Socialist International]]. However, as the Northern Ireland party system is not based on socio-economic divisions, it attracts a wide spectrum of opinion and has a middle class support base. The SDLP support [[Irish reunification]], but utterly reject the use of violence as a means to that end. The SDLP has lost considerable support in the past decade, with the retirement of key figures such as former leader [[John Hume]] and deputy leader [[Seamus Mallon]] and the IRA's cessation of violence. The party has members who wish to follow an agenda focusing primarily on \"bread and butter issues\" (taxation, employment, education, health, etc.) and those who wish to follow a more nationalist campaign to challenge Sinn F\u00e9in.\n\nUnlike in unionism, religion is\u2014according to the study of Evans and Duffy\u2014not a major factor in patterns of nationalist parties' supporters (although Sinn F\u00e9in supporters tend to be more secular). Age has a strong impact on party choice: the more radical Sinn F\u00e9in has more support among the young than the SDLP has. The most important factor is attachment to nationalist ideology: Sinn F\u00e9in has high levels of support among people strongly committed to nationalism<ref>''Beyond the Sectarian Divide: the Social Bases and Political Consequences of Nationalist and Unionist Party Competition in Northern Ireland'' by Geoffrey Evans and Mary Duffy. In ''British Journal of Political Science'', Vol. 27, No. 1. (Jan. 1997), esp. p.72\u201376</ref>\n\n===Cross-community and other parties===\nAmong the cross-community parties, the [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland]] draws its support mainly from middle class professionals in the suburbs of [[Belfast]]. It professes to be the only significant party which does not base its political stance around the constitutional question. The party has strong links with the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] in [[Great Britain|Britain]] and is a member of the [[European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party]] and [[Liberal International]].\n\nOther parties who contest elections in Northern Ireland include the [[Green Party in Northern Ireland|Green Party]], the [[Workers' Party of Ireland|Workers' Party]] and the Northern Ireland branch of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]. The [[feminist]] [[Northern Ireland Women's Coalition]] briefly held seats in the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]], but is now defunct. [[Ulster Third Way]] was a small grouping advocating [[Ulster nationalism|independence for Northern Ireland]].\n\n[[Fianna F\u00e1il]], the second-largest party in the Republic, opened a [[cumann]] (branch) in [[Derry]], and began recruiting at [[Queens University Belfast]]. The leadership {{As of|2005|lc=on}} had decided not to take part in electoral politics in Northern Ireland, however in the latter part of 2007 the Taoiseach said his party was consulting its grassroots on the possibility of contesting elections in the North, and that in advance of this Fianna F\u00e1il had registered as a political party in Northern Ireland.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/7133848.stm |title=BBC NEWS &#124; UK &#124; Northern Ireland &#124; Fianna F\u00e1il accepted as NI party |publisher=News.bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=28 October 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/6998543.stm |title=BBC NEWS &#124; UK &#124; Northern Ireland &#124; Fianna F\u00e1il 'will organise in NI' |publisher=News.bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=28 October 2008}}</ref> Some, within both Fianna F\u00e1il and the SDLP (including former SDLP European elections candidate [[Martin Morgan]]) have advocated an alliance, or even a merger, between both parties. However, many in both parties are hostile to the idea, with some in the SDLP pointing out the left-wing links between the party and the [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Irish Labour Party]].\n\n===Future of political parties in Northern Ireland===\nSome commentators believe there are indications that the religious and ethnic basis of the party system may start to disintegrate. For example, in the 1998\u20132003 Assembly, there was a Catholic [[Member of the Legislative Assembly]] sitting for the [[Ulster Unionist Party]]. The SDLP have had a number of Protestant representatives in the past and a Protestant SDLP councillor defected to Sinn F\u00e9in in 2004. Up to now, these have been one-off events, which have occurred periodically throughout Northern Ireland's history without setting a trend\u2014''cf'' Sir [[Denis Henry]] in the early part of the 20th century. In any event, social class is an important part of competition within the main ethnic political blocs,{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} and class-based party structures in other established democracies have weakened since the end of the [[Cold War]].\n\nThere are indications that party stances on issues like [[same-sex marriage]] are causing people who feel strongly about these issues to vote accordingly, rather than on the constitutional issue.\n\n==Political demography==\n{{see also|Demography of Northern Ireland|Religion in Northern Ireland}}\n[[File:Religion or religion brought up in.png|thumb|450px|Map of religion or religion brought up in from the 2011 census in Northern Ireland. Stronger blue indicates a higher proportion of Catholics.

In contrast, the proportion of people claiming to be Presbyterian and Church of Ireland in the census has decreased.

The anticipated Catholic plurality is based on the assumption that the current trends of demographic change will continue, but at a slower rate than previously. The last 20 years have seen a 10.5% reduction in the proportion of the population who state they are Protestant or brought up Protestant (from 58.5% to 48%), and a 3.5% increase in those of who state they are Catholic or brought up Catholic (from 41.5% to 45%).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/ni/religion.htm#ni-rel-01|title=CAIN: Religion in Northern Ireland|publisher=Cain.ulst.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=26 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nBetween the 2001 and 2011 censuses there was an unprecedented wave of migration into Northern Ireland following [[2004 enlargement of the European Union|the accession of eight countries into the EU]].

Some nationalists have historically sought a favourable arrangement for Ireland within the United Kingdom. Some Protestants (such as paramilitaries and their supporters) usually term themselves as [[Ulster loyalism|loyalists]] as well as unionists. As a result, the term \"loyalist\" has become less popular among unionists in recent decades, especially with unionist politicians. 4% of Catholics and 1% of Protestants supported [[Ulster nationalism|independence for Northern Ireland]] as part of the same survey.<ref name=\"ark.ac.uk\"/> Support for this, while fluctuating, is regarded as insignificant.\n\n{{Wide image|Northern Ireland Constitutional Preference.png|1000px|Shows the proportion of responses to the question \"Do you think the long-term policy for Northern Ireland should be for it,\" in each year of the Northern Ireland Life and Times survey.<ref>{{cite web|title=Northern Ireland Life and Times |url=http://www.ark.ac.uk/nilt/|accessdate=23 July 2014}}</ref> This is an annual survey conducted by Queen's University Belfast and Ulster University.}}\n\n[[Elections in Northern Ireland]] are often characterised as mini-[[referendum]]s on the constitutional question.

Many in Northern Ireland have a [[British people|British national identity]] seeing the English, Scots and Welsh as fellow members of their common nation while seeing those from the [[Republic of Ireland]] as foreigners. Many others in Northern Ireland see those from the Republic of Ireland as being members of their common nation encompassing the island of [[Ireland]] and see the English, Scots and Welsh as foreigners. Co-existing with this dichotomy is a Northern Irish identity which can be held alone or, as is also the case with Englishness, Scottishness and Welshness, alongside a British identity, or alongside an Irish identity. A small number of people see themselves as being both British and Irish.\n\nWhile there is a strong correlation in Northern Ireland between religious background and the perception of which geographical area forms the nation to which that person feels they belong, it is not a strict relationship and national identity is not simply distributed proportionally in accordance with the percentages of different religions in a particular area. For example, Catholics overall are almost five times more likely to view themselves as being British only, than Protestants are to view themselves as being Irish only. In the 2011 census there were four of the twenty-six districts in Northern Ireland, all on the eastern seaboard, where Catholics were more likely to view themselves as being British than Irish: Carrickfergus, Larne, North Down, and Ards; whereas even in those districts where Protestants were most likely to view themselves as Irish, such as Derry, Fermanagh and Newry and Mourne, Protestants were still more than ten times more likely to view themselves as British than Irish.\n\nWhile in the 2011 census Protestants outnumbered Catholics in only half of the districts in Northern Ireland, those who considered themselves British outnumbered those who considered themselves Irish in twenty of the twenty-six districts. This is partly because Catholics were more likely to see themselves as British than Protestants were to see themselves as Irish, but is also partly because those of no religion were substantially more likely to see themselves as British as see themselves as Irish.\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 census]] respondents gave their national identity as follows.\n\n{{Bar chart\n| title       = 2011 Census<ref name=\"DC2106NIa\">{{cite web|title=Northern Ireland Neighbourhood Information Service |url=http://www.ninis2.nisra.gov.uk/Download/Census%202011_Winzip/2011/DC2106NI%20(a).ZIP|accessdate=23 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n| label_type  = National identity\n| data_type   = Respondents\n| bar_width   = 48\n| width_units = em\n| data_max    = 1000000\n| label1   = British\n| data1    = 876,577\n| label2   = Northern Irish\n| data2    = 533,085\n| label3   = Irish\n| data3    = 513,390\n| label4   = English, Scottish or Welsh\n| data4    = 29,187\n| label5   = Other\n| data5    = 61,884\n}}\n\n'''National identity by religion'''<ref>{{cite web|title=Northern Ireland Neighbourhood Information Service |url=http://www.ninis2.nisra.gov.uk/Download/Census%202011_Winzip/2011/DC2239NI%20(a).ZIP|accessdate=22 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n|-\n!

Excepted matters (such as [[international relations]], taxation and elections) are never expected to be considered for devolution. On all other matters, the [[Northern Ireland Executive]] together with the 90-member Northern Ireland Assembly may legislate and govern for Northern Ireland. Additionally, devolution in Northern Ireland is dependent upon participation by members of the Northern Ireland Executive in the [[North/South Ministerial Council]], which co-ordinates areas of co-operation (such as agriculture, education and health) between Northern Ireland and the [[Republic of Ireland]].\n[[Image:StormontGeneral.jpg|thumb|left|[[Parliament Buildings (Northern Ireland)|Parliament Buildings]] at [[Parliament Buildings (Northern Ireland)|Stormont]], Belfast, seat of the assembly]]\nElections to the Northern Ireland Assembly are by [[single transferable vote]] with five representatives (Members of the Legislative Assembly, MLAs) elected from 18 [[List of parliamentary constituencies in Northern Ireland|parliamentary constituencies]]. Eighteen representatives to the lower house of the British parliament (Members of Parliament, MPs) are elected from the same constituencies using the [[First-past-the-post voting|first-past-the-post]] system. However, not all of these take their seats. The seven [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] MPs refuse to take the required [[Oath of Allegiance (United Kingdom)|oath to serve]] [[Queen Elizabeth II]]. In addition, the upper house of the UK's parliament, the [[House of Lords]], currently has some 25 appointed [[List of Northern Ireland members of the House of Lords|members from Northern Ireland]]. Northern Ireland itself forms [[Northern Ireland (European Parliament constituency)|a single constituency]] for elections to the [[European Union]].\n\nThe [[Northern Ireland Office]] represents the British government in Northern Ireland on reserved matters. The [[Government of the Republic of Ireland]] also has the right to \"put forward views and proposals\" on non-devolved matters in relation to Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland Office is led by the [[Secretary of State for Northern Ireland]], who sits in the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom]].\n\nMuch of the population of Northern Ireland identifies with one of two different ideologies: [[Unionism in Ireland|unionism]] (which wants the region to remain part of the United Kingdom) and [[Irish nationalism]] (which wants a [[united Ireland]]). Unionists are predominantly [[Ulster Protestant]], most of whom belong to the [[Presbyterian Church in Ireland]] and the [[Church of Ireland]]. Irish nationalists are almost wholly [[Roman Catholic]]. There is also a small minority of [[Ulster nationalism|Ulster nationalists]] (those who want an independent Northern Irish state), whose religious convictions vary.\n\n==Political representation==\nNorthern Ireland currently has the following political representation:\n* the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] has 90 [[Member of the Legislative Assembly|Members of the Legislative Assembly]] (MLAs) (currently 40 [[Unionism in Ireland|unionists]], 40 [[Irish nationalism|nationalists]], 10 others [constitutionally neutral]), which had its powers restored on 8 May 2007.\n* 18 seats in the United Kingdom [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] (currently 8 unionist MPs, 9 nationalist MPs and 1 neutral MP)<ref>Due to the abstentionist nature of Sinn F\u00e9in MPs, the fact that the [[Church of Ireland]] was [[Disestablishmentarianism|disestablished]] in 1871, meaning the church no longer sends representatives to the House of Lords (unlike the [[Church of England]], which continues to send two [[archbishop]]s and 24 bishops, known as [[Lords Spiritual]]), as well as the fact that bishops of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] are not represented, this has resulted in most Northern Ireland members of [[House of Lords]] (such as [[Eileen Paisley]] and [[David Trimble]]&nbsp;\u2014 see [[List of Northern Ireland Members of the House of Lords]]) coming from Unionist backgrounds by default. In July 2009 [[Nuala O'Loan]], who is married to the SDLP MLA [[Declan O'Loan]], was appointed by [[Gordon Brown]] to this legislative body. The late [[Gerry Fitt]], the first leader of the nationalist [[Social Democratic and Labour Party|SDLP]], sat from 1983 until 2005.</ref>\n* there are several unionists but no nationalists on the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom]] (see [[List of Northern Ireland members of the Privy Council]]).\n* at local level there are 11 [[Local government in Northern Ireland|district councils]]\n\n===Voting patterns===\n\nVoting patterns break down as follows:\n*[[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 Westminster election]] \u2013 unionists 43.2%, nationalists 38.9%, others 17.9%\n*[[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 Westminster election]] \u2013 unionists 49.2%, nationalists 41.2%, others 9.6%\n*[[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 Westminster election]] \u2013 unionists 50.2%, nationalists 38.5%, others 11.2%\n*[[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 Westminster election]] \u2013 unionists 50.5%, nationalists 42.0%, others 7.5%\n*[[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 Westminster election]] \u2013 unionists 51.4%, nationalists 41.8%, others 6.8%\n*[[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 Westminster election]] \u2013 unionists 52.9%, nationalists 42.7%, others 4.4%\n*[[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 Westminster election]] \u2013 unionists 50.5%, nationalists 40.2%, others 9.3%\n\n\n*[[2019 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|2019 European election]] \u2013 unionists 42.9%, nationalists 35.9%, others 21.2%\n*[[2014 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|2014 European election]] \u2013 unionists 51.0%, nationalists 38.6%, others 10.5%\n*[[2009 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|2009 European election]] \u2013 unionists 49.0%, nationalists 42.2%, others 8.8%\n*[[2004 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|2004 European election]] \u2013 unionists 48.6%, nationalists 42.2%, others 9.2%\n*[[1999 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|1999 European election]] \u2013 unionists 52.3%, nationalists 45.4%, others 2.3%\n\n\n*[[2017 Northern Ireland Assembly election|2017 Assembly election]] \u2013 unionists 44.8%, nationalists 40.0%, others 15.5%\n*[[2016 Northern Ireland Assembly election|2016 Assembly election]] \u2013 unionists 48.5%, nationalists 36.4%, others 15.1%\n*[[2011 Northern Ireland Assembly election|2011 Assembly election]] \u2013 unionists 48.3%, nationalists 41.5%, others 10.2%\n*[[2007 Northern Ireland Assembly election|2007 Assembly election]] \u2013 unionists 48.6%, nationalists 42.0%, others 9.4%\n*[[2003 Northern Ireland Assembly election|2003 Assembly election]] \u2013 unionists 52.1%, nationalists 40.5%, others 7.4%\n*[[1998 Northern Ireland Assembly election|1998 Assembly election]] \u2013 unionists 50.6%, nationalists 39.7%, others 9.7%\n\n{{Wide image|Vote Share Northern Ireland Elections.png|1000px|Shows the percentage of votes, or first preference votes, cast for unionist, nationalist and other candidates in elections in Northern Ireland.}}\n\n{{Wide image|NI Assembly seat share by designation.svg|800px|Shows the proportion of seats obtained at each election to the Northern Ireland Assembly by those members designated as unionist, those members designated as nationalist and those members designated as other.}}\n\n{{Wide image|Northern Ireland election seats 1997-2019.svg|1000px|Results in Northern Ireland from UK general elections}}\n\n===Electoral systems===\nIn all elections in Northern Ireland the [[single transferable vote]] system of [[proportional representation]] is used except for the House of Commons elections where a \"first past the post\" or [[plurality voting system]] is used.\n\n===Proposed representation in the Republic===\n[[Sinn F\u00e9in]], currently the biggest of the nationalist parties in Northern Ireland, has campaigned for a broadening of the franchise of Northern Ireland voters to allow them to vote in elections to choose the [[President of Ireland]]. It had also demanded that all Northern Ireland [[Member of the European Parliament|Members of the European Parliament]] (MEPs) and MPs be allowed speaking rights in the lower house of the parliament of the Republic of Ireland, [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]]. It was given to understand that the [[Irish government]] accepted this and had plans to introduce legislation in the autumn of 2005.<ref>{{cite web|author=01/08/2005 \u2013 14:17:53 |url=http://breaking.tcm.ie/2005/08/01/story214291.html |title=Sinn F\u00e9in hails D\u00e1il speaking rights plan &#124; BreakingNews.ie |publisher=Breaking.tcm.ie |date= |accessdate=16 March 2010}}</ref> The [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] (SDLP) backed the move. However, a spokesman for [[Taoiseach]] [[Bertie Ahern]] later rowed back, stating that it had never been intended that the MPs have a right to attend plenary sessions of the D\u00e1il, but that they would be invited to participate in [[Oireachtas]] committees dealing with Northern Ireland matters, and only if there was all-party agreement behind it. The unionist parties, along with [[Fine Gael]], [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour]] and the [[Progressive Democrats]] have all declared their opposition to the move, as has much of the Irish media, with articles highly critical of the proposal published in ''[[The Irish Times]]'' and the ''[[Sunday Independent (Ireland)|Sunday Independent]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unison.ie/irish_independent/stories.php3?ca=9&si=1446370&issue_id=12836 |title=Adams, stay out of our House&nbsp;\u2014 National News, Frontpage&nbsp;\u2014 Independent.ie |publisher=Unison.ie |author=The haunting |date= |accessdate=28 October 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unison.ie/irish_independent/stories.php3?ca=36&si=1450453&issue_id=12866 |title=How Adams got it wrong on speaking in the D\u00e1il&nbsp;\u2014 Analysis&nbsp;\u2014 Independent.ie |publisher=Unison.ie |author=The haunting |date= |accessdate=28 October 2008}}</ref> Nonetheless on 22 November 2007, representatives from both Sinn F\u00e9in and the SDLP, (unionists declined the invitation) attended a meeting of the Oireachtas committee reviewing the workings of the Good Friday Agreement.

Until 1972 the UUP's members of the [[British House of Commons]] took the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] [[whip (politics)|whip]], but currently sit as a party in their own right. The UUP's member of the European Parliament had belonged to the [[European Conservatives and Reformists]] Group.\n\nThe DUP are a more complex mixture than the other major parties, combining support from rural [[evangelicals]] and urban, secular, working class voters. The party is firmly to the right on issues such as abortion, capital punishment, [[European integration]] and [[equal opportunities]], although it seems to be moderating its stance on [[gay rights]] since the \"[[Save Ulster from Sodomy]]\" campaign of the 1980s. Conversely, the DUP often support social programmes which benefit their working class or agricultural base, for example, [[free public transport]] for the elderly and [[European Union]] [[agricultural subsidies]]. The DUP have grown in recent years as they were originally the only major party to oppose the [[Good Friday Agreement]], although until September 2015 they were part of a government operating it.\n\nThe smaller, left-leaning [[Progressive Unionist Party]] and [[Ulster Political Research Group]] are linked with the [[Ulster Volunteer Force]] and [[Ulster Defence Association]] respectively.\n\n===Nationalist parties===\n[[File:Funeral of Martin McGuinness (2).jpg|thumb|The funeral procession of Sinn F\u00e9in politician [[Martin McGuinness]], Londonderry, 2017]]\nSimilarly, on the nationalist side of the political spectrum, Sinn F\u00e9in has overtaken the traditionally dominant SDLP in recent elections. Sinn F\u00e9in is a left-wing [[Irish republican]] party, committed to espousing an [[United Ireland|all-Ireland]] republic. Traditionally the party of the urban Catholic working class and a number of republican rural areas, since the IRA ceasefires of the mid-1990s it has expanded its base considerably and has overtaken the long-dominant SDLP in terms of vote share.\n\nThe SDLP are a nominally [[social democratic]] party and a full member of the [[Party of European Socialists]] and [[Socialist International]]. However, as the Northern Ireland party system is not based on socio-economic divisions, it attracts a wide spectrum of opinion and has a middle class support base. The SDLP support [[Irish reunification]], but utterly reject the use of violence as a means to that end. The SDLP has lost considerable support in the past decade, with the retirement of key figures such as former leader [[John Hume]] and deputy leader [[Seamus Mallon]] and the IRA's cessation of violence. The party has members who wish to follow an agenda focusing primarily on \"bread and butter issues\" (taxation, employment, education, health, etc.) and those who wish to follow a more nationalist campaign to challenge Sinn F\u00e9in.\n\nUnlike in unionism, religion is\u2014according to the study of Evans and Duffy\u2014not a major factor in patterns of nationalist parties' supporters (although Sinn F\u00e9in supporters tend to be more secular). Age has a strong impact on party choice: the more radical Sinn F\u00e9in has more support among the young than the SDLP has. The most important factor is attachment to nationalist ideology: Sinn F\u00e9in has high levels of support among people strongly committed to nationalism<ref>''Beyond the Sectarian Divide: the Social Bases and Political Consequences of Nationalist and Unionist Party Competition in Northern Ireland'' by Geoffrey Evans and Mary Duffy. In ''British Journal of Political Science'', Vol. 27, No. 1. (Jan. 1997), esp. p.72\u201376</ref>\n\n===Cross-community and other parties===\nAmong the cross-community parties, the [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland]] draws its support mainly from middle class professionals in the suburbs of [[Belfast]]. It professes to be the only significant party which does not base its political stance around the constitutional question. The party has strong links with the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] in [[Great Britain|Britain]] and is a member of the [[European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party]] and [[Liberal International]].\n\nOther parties who contest elections in Northern Ireland include the [[Green Party in Northern Ireland|Green Party]], the [[Workers' Party of Ireland|Workers' Party]] and the Northern Ireland branch of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]. The [[feminist]] [[Northern Ireland Women's Coalition]] briefly held seats in the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]], but is now defunct. [[Ulster Third Way]] was a small grouping advocating [[Ulster nationalism|independence for Northern Ireland]].\n\n[[Fianna F\u00e1il]], the second-largest party in the Republic, opened a [[cumann]] (branch) in [[Derry]], and began recruiting at [[Queens University Belfast]]. The leadership {{As of|2005|lc=on}} had decided not to take part in electoral politics in Northern Ireland, however in the latter part of 2007 the Taoiseach said his party was consulting its grassroots on the possibility of contesting elections in the North, and that in advance of this Fianna F\u00e1il had registered as a political party in Northern Ireland.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/7133848.stm |title=BBC NEWS &#124; UK &#124; Northern Ireland &#124; Fianna F\u00e1il accepted as NI party |publisher=News.bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=28 October 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/6998543.stm |title=BBC NEWS &#124; UK &#124; Northern Ireland &#124; Fianna F\u00e1il 'will organise in NI' |publisher=News.bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=28 October 2008}}</ref> Some, within both Fianna F\u00e1il and the SDLP (including former SDLP European elections candidate [[Martin Morgan]]) have advocated an alliance, or even a merger, between both parties. However, many in both parties are hostile to the idea, with some in the SDLP pointing out the left-wing links between the party and the [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Irish Labour Party]].\n\n===Future of political parties in Northern Ireland===\nSome commentators believe there are indications that the religious and ethnic basis of the party system may start to disintegrate. For example, in the 1998\u20132003 Assembly, there was a Catholic [[Member of the Legislative Assembly]] sitting for the [[Ulster Unionist Party]]. The SDLP have had a number of Protestant representatives in the past and a Protestant SDLP councillor defected to Sinn F\u00e9in in 2004. Up to now, these have been one-off events, which have occurred periodically throughout Northern Ireland's history without setting a trend\u2014''cf'' Sir [[Denis Henry]] in the early part of the 20th century. In any event, social class is an important part of competition within the main ethnic political blocs,{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} and class-based party structures in other established democracies have weakened since the end of the [[Cold War]].\n\nThere are indications that party stances on issues like [[same-sex marriage]] are causing people who feel strongly about these issues to vote accordingly, rather than on the constitutional issue.\n\n==Political demography==\n{{see also|Demography of Northern Ireland|Religion in Northern Ireland}}\n[[File:Religion or religion brought up in.png|thumb|450px|Map of religion or religion brought up in from the 2011 census in Northern Ireland.

In contrast, the proportion of people claiming to be Presbyterian and Church of Ireland in the census has decreased.

The anticipated Catholic plurality is based on the assumption that the current trends of demographic change will continue, but at a slower rate than previously. The last 20 years have seen a 10.5% reduction in the proportion of the population who state they are Protestant or brought up Protestant (from 58.5% to 48%), and a 3.5% increase in those of who state they are Catholic or brought up Catholic (from 41.5% to 45%).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/ni/religion.htm#ni-rel-01|title=CAIN: Religion in Northern Ireland|publisher=Cain.ulst.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=26 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nBetween the 2001 and 2011 censuses there was an unprecedented wave of migration into Northern Ireland following [[2004 enlargement of the European Union|the accession of eight countries into the EU]].

Some nationalists have historically sought a favourable arrangement for Ireland within the United Kingdom. Some Protestants (such as paramilitaries and their supporters) usually term themselves as [[Ulster loyalism|loyalists]] as well as unionists. As a result, the term \"loyalist\" has become less popular among unionists in recent decades, especially with unionist politicians. 4% of Catholics and 1% of Protestants supported [[Ulster nationalism|independence for Northern Ireland]] as part of the same survey.<ref name=\"ark.ac.uk\"/> Support for this, while fluctuating, is regarded as insignificant.\n\n{{Wide image|Northern Ireland Constitutional Preference.png|1000px|Shows the proportion of responses to the question \"Do you think the long-term policy for Northern Ireland should be for it,\" in each year of the Northern Ireland Life and Times survey.<ref>{{cite web|title=Northern Ireland Life and Times |url=http://www.ark.ac.uk/nilt/|accessdate=23 July 2014}}</ref> This is an annual survey conducted by Queen's University Belfast and Ulster University.}}\n\n[[Elections in Northern Ireland]] are often characterised as mini-[[referendum]]s on the constitutional question.

Many in Northern Ireland have a [[British people|British national identity]] seeing the English, Scots and Welsh as fellow members of their common nation while seeing those from the [[Republic of Ireland]] as foreigners. Many others in Northern Ireland see those from the Republic of Ireland as being members of their common nation encompassing the island of [[Ireland]] and see the English, Scots and Welsh as foreigners. Co-existing with this dichotomy is a Northern Irish identity which can be held alone or, as is also the case with Englishness, Scottishness and Welshness, alongside a British identity, or alongside an Irish identity. A small number of people see themselves as being both British and Irish.\n\nWhile there is a strong correlation in Northern Ireland between religious background and the perception of which geographical area forms the nation to which that person feels they belong, it is not a strict relationship and national identity is not simply distributed proportionally in accordance with the percentages of different religions in a particular area. For example, Catholics overall are almost five times more likely to view themselves as being British only, than Protestants are to view themselves as being Irish only. In the 2011 census there were four of the twenty-six districts in Northern Ireland, all on the eastern seaboard, where Catholics were more likely to view themselves as being British than Irish: Carrickfergus, Larne, North Down, and Ards; whereas even in those districts where Protestants were most likely to view themselves as Irish, such as Derry, Fermanagh and Newry and Mourne, Protestants were still more than ten times more likely to view themselves as British than Irish.\n\nWhile in the 2011 census Protestants outnumbered Catholics in only half of the districts in Northern Ireland, those who considered themselves British outnumbered those who considered themselves Irish in twenty of the twenty-six districts. This is partly because Catholics were more likely to see themselves as British than Protestants were to see themselves as Irish, but is also partly because those of no religion were substantially more likely to see themselves as British as see themselves as Irish.\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 census]] respondents gave their national identity as follows.\n\n{{Bar chart\n| title       = 2011 Census<ref name=\"DC2106NIa\">{{cite web|title=Northern Ireland Neighbourhood Information Service |url=http://www.ninis2.nisra.gov.uk/Download/Census%202011_Winzip/2011/DC2106NI%20(a).ZIP|accessdate=23 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n| label_type  = National identity\n| data_type   = Respondents\n| bar_width   = 48\n| width_units = em\n| data_max    = 1000000\n| label1   = British\n| data1    = 876,577\n| label2   = Northern Irish\n| data2    = 533,085\n| label3   = Irish\n| data3    = 513,390\n| label4   = English, Scottish or Welsh\n| data4    = 29,187\n| label5   = Other\n| data5    = 61,884\n}}\n\n'''National identity by religion'''<ref>{{cite web|title=Northern Ireland Neighbourhood Information Service |url=http://www.ninis2.nisra.gov.uk/Download/Census%202011_Winzip/2011/DC2239NI%20(a).ZIP|accessdate=22 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n|-\n!

His own mother, Gracia Bayonito-Geisler, eventually signed him up in a [[Alcohol detoxification|detox facility]] (for 10 days) thus helping him earn the nickname as the \"Wild Child\" of ''[[Pinoy Big Brother: Celebrity Edition 2]]'' and tagged as the modern day \"Bad Boy\" in Philippine showbiz.\n\n===Sexual harassment allegations===\nIn 2008, Geisler faced a [[lawsuit]] against fellow former ''[[Pinoy Big Brother]]'' housemate [[Yayo Aguila]]'s daughter Patricia accusing him of an alleged sexual harassment in which Geisler has denied engaging. The case was on-going as Geisler appeared in several TV series projects such as ''[[Eva Fonda]]'', ''[[Tayong Dalawa]]'' (\"''The Two of Us''\"), ''[[The Wedding (TV series)|The Wedding]]'', among others. Geisler also faced a lawsuit filed by actress [[Yasmien Kurdi]] for another alleged sexual harassment case on the same year.\n\n===Indefinite artist ban===\nIn early 2011, Geisler faced a harassment complaint from actress [[Cherry Pie Picache]] who accused him for groping her breast on the set of ''[[Noah (TV series)|Noah]]'' in which Geisler has denied engaging and claimed it was just an accidental touch.<ref name=\"Cherry Pie\"/> It was reported that Geisler was under the influence of alcohol on that taping day. This was Geisler's fourth acts of lasciviousness/unjust vexation accusation, the other three are with Patricia Martinez, [[Yasmien Kurdi]] and [[Julia Clarete]], respectively.\n\nIt was later confirmed by Geisler's manager, Arnold Vegafria, that Geisler immediately made a public apology statement in the presence of Picache right after the incident and voluntarily entered rehabilitation in a 90-day treatment session.<ref name=\"Rehab\"/> The Professional Artist Management, Inc. (PAMI) stated that Geisler will be on an indefinite artist ban which prohibits artists and talents whose managers are PAMI-members from working with Geisler unless he could complete his 90-day treatment session and be fully rehabilitated. Geisler's alcohol rehabilitation started on January 30, 2011 and as per confirmation by the rehab center, had successfully completed.\n\n[[File:Erningtoothpick.jpg|280px|thumb|Geisler in August 2010]]\nAfter finishing rehab, Geisler and Yasmien Kurdi reconciled resulting in Kurdi withdrawing the case filed against him. Upon his return to acting, Geisler played Erning Toothpick (a character originally played by actor [[Paquito Diaz]] based on its real life counterpart, Ernesto Reyes) in the [[2011 Metro Manila Film Festival]] entry of [[Viva Films]], ''[[Manila Kingpin: The Asiong Salonga Story]]'' top-billed by [[Laguna province|Laguna]] Governor [[ER Ejercito|Jeorge \"ER\" Ejercito Estregan]].\n\n===Bouncer altercation===\nIn mid 2015, Geisler's video of alleged altercation with a bouncer at a bar in Angeles City went viral in social media. Reports say that Geisler got frustrated and challenged the bouncers to a fist fight after being denied entry at the said bar due to alcohol intoxication.<ref name=\"Bar Incident\"/>\n\n===Khalil Versoza===\nOn May 15, 2016, a video which was originally posted through Facebook by a [[University of the Philippines]] filmmaking student Khalil Versoza showing Geisler berating and allegedly hurting a fellow student went [[viral video|viral]]. According to Verzosa, they hired Geisler for a school project. Furthermore, he stated that Geisler went berserk over the use of an idiot board \u2014 a board where dialogue is written for actors to read. In the accompanying caption, Verzosa explained that they were only able to send Geisler the script on the morning of the day of the shoot because, as students, they had to attend to other matters. While Geisler received numerous bashes from [[netizen]]s, some also questioned the legitimacy of the video as \"scripted\" and others call it a \"social experiment\". Geisler issued a statement on the following day saying that the video was \"taken out of context\" and that whatever the intention of the uploader was, it was \"meant to exploit his already damaged reputation\". Geisler further said he will consult his lawyers what legal action to take on the video uploader.<ref name=\"Taken Out of Context\"/> \n\nOn May 18, Verzosa said that he and Geisler have talked to each other over the matter. Verzosa revealed that the video they were shooting was focused on [[Republic Act|''Republic Act No. 9262'']], a law to counter violence against women and children with Geisler's previous court cases involving women as its inspiration. Verzosa added that the reason behind for uploading the video was that as an anti-violence advocate himself, \"he initially thought it was his form of justice and awareness raising\" and that the \"harsh comments and negative reactions\" from the netizens towards Geisler are \"different\" from what he expected. Verzosa and Geisler made amends since and eventually talked over the possibility of shooting an \"anti-rape advocacy video\" sometime in the future which both are open with. Verzosa took down the video and urged netizens to stop sharing the video. Geisler then posted a message for critics who alleged that he is under the influence of drugs by challenging them to let him take a random drug test as he is willing to take a test any day and that if the result is negative, those critics would have to \"pay\" him.<ref name=\"Khalil Versoza\"/>\n\n===Kiko Matos===\nOn May 25, 2016, another video of Geisler went viral through Facebook showing him and independent film actor Kiko Matos on a bar fight in [[Tomas Morato Avenue|Tomas Morato]], Quezon City. According to a witness' testimony about the incident via Facebook, Geisler was \"only protective\" of the bartender whom Matos was allegedly badmouthing because his company's cocktail drink order was taking time to be served. Geisler was asking the alleged impatient Matos to \"lower his voice down\" because he's not the only person at the bar. However, Matos was hardened by his comment, telling him to \"mind his own business\" and lambasted him with foul language. Geisler also responded with reproach, but he also reportedly shoved a stool and flung it on Matos. Additionally, the band performing that night had tried to settle a truce between the two. Geisler appears to have yielded by offering a handshake, but before he could even reach his hand, Matos grabbed him by the arm and punched him several times.<ref name=\"Altercation\"/> Matos later denied that he disrespected the bartender. On a May 29 interview, Matos said that it was Geisler who has started the fight by insisting on jamming with the band which turned out to be a fund-raising concert for a political detainee. He said that Geisler got irked and hurled insults at him and his company just for asking to step down from the stage.<ref name=\"Teach a Lesson\"/>  [[Universal Reality Combat Championship]], a Philippine-based [[mixed martial arts]] company, announced that the two actors will fight in a special exhibition match set on June 25, 2016 at the Valkyrie at The Palace, [[Taguig]] to settle the feud between them.<ref name=\"MMA Fight\"/> The two-round match concluded in a unanimous draw.<ref name=\"Draw\"/><ref name=\"Ends in a Draw\"/>  Post-match, the two actors immediately reconciled over their earlier bouts including the bar scuffle. Geisler commended Matos for their fight despite having had their scores tied admitting he deserved victory.<ref name=\"URCC\"/> Geisler said of Matos, \"I believe we respect each other as actors and as human beings.\" It was later revealed that the series of events were documented as part of a documentary film called ''Beastmode'' starred by Geisler and Matos themselves, however Geisler denied that the URCC fight was scripted.<ref name=\"Respect\"/>\n\n===Ping Medina===\nIn late November 2016, it was reported that Geisler had been involved in an altercation with fellow actor [[Ping Medina]]. Medina released a lengthy Facebook post with a photo of himself, sitting on a wheelchair and his [[The finger|middle finger aloft]] using his broken hand wrapped in bandages as a gesture of contempt against Geisler in the wake of the incident. According to his post, Geisler urinated on him during a shoot of an independent film in [[Subic, Zambales|Subic]]. He issued an apology about the incident later on, admitting that he had been drinking and was heavily medicated with anti-depressants while filming.<ref>{{citation|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/entertainment/12/01/16/baron-apologizes-to-ping-over-pissing-incident |title=Baron apologizes to Ping over pissing incident |work=[[ABS-CBN Corporation]] |date=December 1, 2016 |accessdate=December 2, 2016}}</ref> The same day, the film's director, Arlyn Dela Cruz, confirmed on her Facebook account that Geisler's role had been \"written out\" for the incident; she disclosed that some actors initially advised her not to work with Geisler, due to his \"unruly behavior\".<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/590524/showbiz/chikaminute/ping-medina-says-he-broke-hand-in-anger-after-baron-geisler-peed-on-him-during-scene |title=Ping Medina says he broke hand in anger after Baron Geisler peed on him during scene |work=[[GMA News]] |date=November 28, 2016 |accessdate=December 2, 2016}}</ref> In December 2016, Dela Cruz also confirmed that she would be replacing Medina with an unnamed actor in hopes that she could bring back the \"happy atmosphere\" on the set of her film.<ref>{{citation|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/entertainment/12/02/16/director-replaces-ping-medina-after-incident-with-baron |title=Director replaces Ping Medina after incident with Baron |work=[[ABS-CBN Corporation]] |date=December 2, 2016 |accessdate=December 2, 2016}}</ref> Geisler was then banned again by PAMI prohibiting him from working with PAMI-associated actors and filmmakers, until the decision was lifted in late 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://entertainment.inquirer.net/243297/pami-lifts-ban-on-baron-geisler|title=PAMI lifts ban on Baron Geisler|last=Abanilla|first=Clarizel|website=entertainment.inquirer.net|language=en|access-date=2019-07-28}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2020, it was revealed that Medina was actually a rapist and Geisler's actions were done in retaliation for Medina's victims.\n\n===Legal troubles===\n====Raymundo dela Rosa====\nGeisler was temporarily detained for physical assault to his neighbor named Raymundo dela Rosa on November 9, 2012. He was released less than 24 hours after a mutual settlement from both parties as the file was withdrawn by dela Rosa. Geisler claimed that the incident was just for self-defense purposes. It was also later found out that Geisler was intoxicated that time.\n\nGeisler later stated in an interview that he was struggling from an extreme [[bipolar disorder]] and was under a strict medication for the said illness.<ref name=\"Bipolar\"/>\n\n====Car accident====\nOn September 15, 2015, Geisler was involved in a car accident but left unhurt. Geisler's SUV crashed with a 16-wheeler truck in [[Pasig City]] before dawn. Geisler was presumably under the influence of alcohol according to early reports. Geisler\u2019s vehicle and the truck were brought to the Pasig City traffic bureau as the investigation continued to determine who was at fault. According to a report from [[DZMM]] posted on the ABS-CBN website, the Traffic Division of Pasig City said that Geisler was driving his car after his taping when he got into an accident with the truck. No one was hurt but according to Geisler, his companion during the clash suffered minor injuries.<ref name=\"Car Accident\"/>\n\n====2017 restobar arrest====\nGeisler was arrested in October 2017 for alleged violent behavior in a resto-bar located along Tomas Morato Avenue in Quezon City after allegedly shouting and going amok at customers and staff members. Geisler insisted he did not cause trouble at the bar and accused the police of not following due process in arresting him. Geisler was charged with unjust vexation and alarm & scandal by the bar owner. Prior to the incident, Geisler also had a standing arrest warrant issued in Cebu for smoking inside a plane which violates the Civil Aviation Authority Act.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/938766/banned-baron-geisler-in-trouble-again-brother-apologizes|title='Banned' Baron Geisler in trouble again; brother apologizes|last=Enano|first=Jhesset O.|website=newsinfo.inquirer.net|language=en|access-date=2019-07-28}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/metro/629779/actor-baron-geisler-arrested-in-qc-resto-bar/story/|title=Actor Baron Geisler arrested in QC restobar|website=GMA News Online|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-28}}</ref> Geisler was released after a week.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rmn.ph/baron-geisler-planong-ipasok-sa-rehab-paglabas-ng-kulungan/|title=Baron Geisler, planong ipasok sa rehab paglabas ng kulungan|last=Nation|first=RMN News Nationwide: The Sound Of The|date=2017-10-18|website=RMN Networks|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-28}}</ref>\n\n====Brother-in-law altercation and arrest====\nOn March 3, 2018, Geisler posted a photo of his bruised face on his Instagram account, accusing a family member of beating him up due to financial matters. It was revealed that he got into a physical altercation with his brother in law Michael Robinstone Rodriguez Morales, husband of elder sister Grace Geisler-Morales, after allegedly displaying unruly intoxicated behavior inside Morales's house in Angeles City. According to Morales, he went to Geisler's house and confronted him about allegedly badmouthing his daughter (Geisler's niece) earlier on that day. Morales added that he was provoked by Geisler which resulted in a scuffle. Morales also posted a photo of their house being vandalized by Geisler.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/entertainment/03/05/18/barons-brother-in-law-speaks-up-he-asked-for-it-and-he-got-it|title=Baron's brother-in-law speaks up: He asked for it, and he got it|last=News|first=ABS-CBN|website=ABS-CBN News|access-date=2019-07-28}}</ref>\n\nOn March 5, 2018, Geisler was arrested after he allegedly \"threatened to kill\" Morales.

In 2020, Baron has undergone a severe character development and has shown himself as the true protagonist and hero of the Filipino people.\n\nGeisler was born at [[Clark Air Base]], [[Angeles, Philippines|Angeles City]], [[Philippines]]. As a child actor and later as a teen idol, Geisler's career has been characterized by critical and popular notoriety followed by a period of alcohol abuse and legal troubles, before a resumption of critical repute and resurgence of commercial success in middle age. Several of Geisler's accolades includes winning the Best Actor award in the [[Cinemalaya Independent Film Festival|4th Cinemalaya Independent Film Festival]] on July 20, 2008 and the 2005 PMPC Best Single Performance of an Actor in ''[[Maalaala Mo Kaya]]'' (\"''Would You Remember?''\").\n\nIn 2019, he is best known for the role of [[Ang Probinsyano]] as Dante \"Bungo\" Madarang.\n\n==Life and career==\n===Early life===\nGeisler was born to Gracia Bayonito of Bicol, Philippines and Donald David Geisler Jr., a [[German American]] who was stationed at the former U.S. military base in Angeles City. His older brother is Olympian [[Donald Geisler]].<ref name=\"Donnie Geisler\"/>\n\n===Early acting career===\n[[File:Barongeislercirca1996.jpg|thumb|150px|Baron Geisler in 1997]]\nGeisler entered show business as a [[child actor]] in 1994 through the phenomenal variety kiddie/teen gag show, ''[[Ang TV]]''. A year later, he became officially a part of [[ABS-CBN]]'s roster of rising homegrown talents as a member of the elite [[Star Magic|Star Circle]] Batch 5. He was considered as one of the network's most promising young stars alongside [[John Lloyd Cruz]] and [[Marc Solis]] in the teen boy trio \"Koolits\", where he was once paired up with [[Kristine Hermosa]]. Geisler cites veteran Filipino actor [[Johnny Delgado]] as a major influence in acting. As a teen, Geisler was paired with several loveteams, most notably with ex-girlfriend [[Jodi Santamaria|Jodi Sta Maria]].\n\n===Later/recent acting career===\nIn 2009, Geisler has considered changing network from [[ABS-CBN]] to [[GMA Network]] after being offered to be a part of [[SRO Cinemaserye]] of GMA.<ref name=\"Positive Publicity\"/> Yet, he remained a freelance actor appearing to both networks. Geisler is currently a part of [[ALV Talent Circuit]], Inc.\n\nIn 2014, Geisler starred in an independent film titled ''Waves'' co-starring Polish-American model Ilona Struzik.

He was also part the 1st Batch of Lucky Stars in ''[[Kapamilya Deal or No Deal]]''.\n\nIn 2017, Geisler made his theater debut as Tikbalang/Amerikano in Tanghalang Pilipino\u2019s rock sarswela \u201cAurelio Sedisyoso\".\n\nIn May 2019, after going in sabbatical for alcohol dependence recovery in Cebu, Geisler returned to acting via ''[[FPJ's Ang Probinsyano]]'' in a critically acclaimed performance where he played one of the show's villains.\n\n==Personal life==\nAn art enthusiast, Geisler has a wide variety of tattoos on his body.\n\nAside from former ''[[Tabing Ilog]]'' co-star [[Jodi Sta. Maria]], Geisler's also known to have had past relationships with actresses such as [[Kristine Hermosa]], [[Matet de Leon]], [[Desiree del Valle]], [[Dionne Monsanto]] and Cai Cortez (daughter of veteran actor Rez Cortez).

During the early 2000s, while his performance as an actor was going stellar, his career on the other hand was becoming stiff. He has confessed to being [[alcoholism|addicted to alcohol]] after his father's demise and his own break-up with actress [[Jodi Santamaria|Jodi Sta. Maria]]. Geisler's family house has also been razed by fire twice and he himself has been involved in numerous brawls. One of the said brawls was a bar scuffle, in fact, left him with two visible scars on his left cheek. His own mother, Gracia Bayonito-Geisler, eventually signed him up in a [[Alcohol detoxification|detox facility]] (for 10 days) thus helping him earn the nickname as the \"Wild Child\" of ''[[Pinoy Big Brother: Celebrity Edition 2]]'' and tagged as the modern day \"Bad Boy\" in Philippine showbiz.\n\n===Sexual harassment allegations===\nIn 2008, Geisler faced a [[lawsuit]] against fellow former ''[[Pinoy Big Brother]]'' housemate [[Yayo Aguila]]'s daughter Patricia accusing him of an alleged sexual harassment in which Geisler has denied engaging. The case was on-going as Geisler appeared in several TV series projects such as ''[[Eva Fonda]]'', ''[[Tayong Dalawa]]'' (\"''The Two of Us''\"), ''[[The Wedding (TV series)|The Wedding]]'', among others. Geisler also faced a lawsuit filed by actress [[Yasmien Kurdi]] for another alleged sexual harassment case on the same year.\n\n===Indefinite artist ban===\nIn early 2011, Geisler faced a harassment complaint from actress [[Cherry Pie Picache]] who accused him for groping her breast on the set of ''[[Noah (TV series)|Noah]]'' in which Geisler has denied engaging and claimed it was just an accidental touch.<ref name=\"Cherry Pie\"/> It was reported that Geisler was under the influence of alcohol on that taping day. This was Geisler's fourth acts of lasciviousness/unjust vexation accusation, the other three are with Patricia Martinez, [[Yasmien Kurdi]] and [[Julia Clarete]], respectively.\n\nIt was later confirmed by Geisler's manager, Arnold Vegafria, that Geisler immediately made a public apology statement in the presence of Picache right after the incident and voluntarily entered rehabilitation in a 90-day treatment session.<ref name=\"Rehab\"/> The Professional Artist Management, Inc. (PAMI) stated that Geisler will be on an indefinite artist ban which prohibits artists and talents whose managers are PAMI-members from working with Geisler unless he could complete his 90-day treatment session and be fully rehabilitated. Geisler's alcohol rehabilitation started on January 30, 2011 and as per confirmation by the rehab center, had successfully completed.\n\n[[File:Erningtoothpick.jpg|280px|thumb|Geisler in August 2010]]\nAfter finishing rehab, Geisler and Yasmien Kurdi reconciled resulting in Kurdi withdrawing the case filed against him. Upon his return to acting, Geisler played Erning Toothpick (a character originally played by actor [[Paquito Diaz]] based on its real life counterpart, Ernesto Reyes) in the [[2011 Metro Manila Film Festival]] entry of [[Viva Films]], ''[[Manila Kingpin: The Asiong Salonga Story]]'' top-billed by [[Laguna province|Laguna]] Governor [[ER Ejercito|Jeorge \"ER\" Ejercito Estregan]].\n\n===Bouncer altercation===\nIn mid 2015, Geisler's video of alleged altercation with a bouncer at a bar in Angeles City went viral in social media. Reports say that Geisler got frustrated and challenged the bouncers to a fist fight after being denied entry at the said bar due to alcohol intoxication.<ref name=\"Bar Incident\"/>\n\n===Khalil Versoza===\nOn May 15, 2016, a video which was originally posted through Facebook by a [[University of the Philippines]] filmmaking student Khalil Versoza showing Geisler berating and allegedly hurting a fellow student went [[viral video|viral]]. According to Verzosa, they hired Geisler for a school project. Furthermore, he stated that Geisler went berserk over the use of an idiot board \u2014 a board where dialogue is written for actors to read. In the accompanying caption, Verzosa explained that they were only able to send Geisler the script on the morning of the day of the shoot because, as students, they had to attend to other matters. While Geisler received numerous bashes from [[netizen]]s, some also questioned the legitimacy of the video as \"scripted\" and others call it a \"social experiment\". Geisler issued a statement on the following day saying that the video was \"taken out of context\" and that whatever the intention of the uploader was, it was \"meant to exploit his already damaged reputation\". Geisler further said he will consult his lawyers what legal action to take on the video uploader.<ref name=\"Taken Out of Context\"/> \n\nOn May 18, Verzosa said that he and Geisler have talked to each other over the matter. Verzosa revealed that the video they were shooting was focused on [[Republic Act|''Republic Act No. 9262'']], a law to counter violence against women and children with Geisler's previous court cases involving women as its inspiration. Verzosa added that the reason behind for uploading the video was that as an anti-violence advocate himself, \"he initially thought it was his form of justice and awareness raising\" and that the \"harsh comments and negative reactions\" from the netizens towards Geisler are \"different\" from what he expected. Verzosa and Geisler made amends since and eventually talked over the possibility of shooting an \"anti-rape advocacy video\" sometime in the future which both are open with. Verzosa took down the video and urged netizens to stop sharing the video. Geisler then posted a message for critics who alleged that he is under the influence of drugs by challenging them to let him take a random drug test as he is willing to take a test any day and that if the result is negative, those critics would have to \"pay\" him.<ref name=\"Khalil Versoza\"/>\n\n===Kiko Matos===\nOn May 25, 2016, another video of Geisler went viral through Facebook showing him and independent film actor Kiko Matos on a bar fight in [[Tomas Morato Avenue|Tomas Morato]], Quezon City. According to a witness' testimony about the incident via Facebook, Geisler was \"only protective\" of the bartender whom Matos was allegedly badmouthing because his company's cocktail drink order was taking time to be served. Geisler was asking the alleged impatient Matos to \"lower his voice down\" because he's not the only person at the bar. However, Matos was hardened by his comment, telling him to \"mind his own business\" and lambasted him with foul language. Geisler also responded with reproach, but he also reportedly shoved a stool and flung it on Matos. Additionally, the band performing that night had tried to settle a truce between the two. Geisler appears to have yielded by offering a handshake, but before he could even reach his hand, Matos grabbed him by the arm and punched him several times.<ref name=\"Altercation\"/> Matos later denied that he disrespected the bartender. On a May 29 interview, Matos said that it was Geisler who has started the fight by insisting on jamming with the band which turned out to be a fund-raising concert for a political detainee. He said that Geisler got irked and hurled insults at him and his company just for asking to step down from the stage.<ref name=\"Teach a Lesson\"/>  [[Universal Reality Combat Championship]], a Philippine-based [[mixed martial arts]] company, announced that the two actors will fight in a special exhibition match set on June 25, 2016 at the Valkyrie at The Palace, [[Taguig]] to settle the feud between them.<ref name=\"MMA Fight\"/> The two-round match concluded in a unanimous draw.<ref name=\"Draw\"/><ref name=\"Ends in a Draw\"/>  Post-match, the two actors immediately reconciled over their earlier bouts including the bar scuffle. Geisler commended Matos for their fight despite having had their scores tied admitting he deserved victory.<ref name=\"URCC\"/> Geisler said of Matos, \"I believe we respect each other as actors and as human beings.\" It was later revealed that the series of events were documented as part of a documentary film called ''Beastmode'' starred by Geisler and Matos themselves, however Geisler denied that the URCC fight was scripted.<ref name=\"Respect\"/>\n\n===Ping Medina===\nIn late November 2016, it was reported that Geisler had been involved in an altercation with fellow actor [[Ping Medina]]. Medina released a lengthy Facebook post with a photo of himself, sitting on a wheelchair and his [[The finger|middle finger aloft]] using his broken hand wrapped in bandages as a gesture of contempt against Geisler in the wake of the incident. According to his post, Geisler urinated on him during a shoot of an independent film in [[Subic, Zambales|Subic]]. He issued an apology about the incident later on, admitting that he had been drinking and was heavily medicated with anti-depressants while filming.<ref>{{citation|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/entertainment/12/01/16/baron-apologizes-to-ping-over-pissing-incident |title=Baron apologizes to Ping over pissing incident |work=[[ABS-CBN Corporation]] |date=December 1, 2016 |accessdate=December 2, 2016}}</ref> The same day, the film's director, Arlyn Dela Cruz, confirmed on her Facebook account that Geisler's role had been \"written out\" for the incident; she disclosed that some actors initially advised her not to work with Geisler, due to his \"unruly behavior\".<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/590524/showbiz/chikaminute/ping-medina-says-he-broke-hand-in-anger-after-baron-geisler-peed-on-him-during-scene |title=Ping Medina says he broke hand in anger after Baron Geisler peed on him during scene |work=[[GMA News]] |date=November 28, 2016 |accessdate=December 2, 2016}}</ref> In December 2016, Dela Cruz also confirmed that she would be replacing Medina with an unnamed actor in hopes that she could bring back the \"happy atmosphere\" on the set of her film.<ref>{{citation|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/entertainment/12/02/16/director-replaces-ping-medina-after-incident-with-baron |title=Director replaces Ping Medina after incident with Baron |work=[[ABS-CBN Corporation]] |date=December 2, 2016 |accessdate=December 2, 2016}}</ref> Geisler was then banned again by PAMI prohibiting him from working with PAMI-associated actors and filmmakers, until the decision was lifted in late 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://entertainment.inquirer.net/243297/pami-lifts-ban-on-baron-geisler|title=PAMI lifts ban on Baron Geisler|last=Abanilla|first=Clarizel|website=entertainment.inquirer.net|language=en|access-date=2019-07-28}}</ref>\n\n===Legal troubles===\n====Raymundo dela Rosa====\nGeisler was temporarily detained for physical assault to his neighbor named Raymundo dela Rosa on November 9, 2012. He was released less than 24 hours after a mutual settlement from both parties as the file was withdrawn by dela Rosa. Geisler claimed that the incident was just for self-defense purposes. It was also later found out that Geisler was intoxicated that time.\n\nGeisler later stated in an interview that he was struggling from an extreme [[bipolar disorder]] and was under a strict medication for the said illness.<ref name=\"Bipolar\"/>\n\n====Car accident====\nOn September 15, 2015, Geisler was involved in a car accident but left unhurt. Geisler's SUV crashed with a 16-wheeler truck in [[Pasig City]] before dawn. Geisler was presumably under the influence of alcohol according to early reports. Geisler\u2019s vehicle and the truck were brought to the Pasig City traffic bureau as the investigation continued to determine who was at fault. According to a report from [[DZMM]] posted on the ABS-CBN website, the Traffic Division of Pasig City said that Geisler was driving his car after his taping when he got into an accident with the truck. No one was hurt but according to Geisler, his companion during the clash suffered minor injuries.<ref name=\"Car Accident\"/>\n\n====2017 restobar arrest====\nGeisler was arrested in October 2017 for alleged violent behavior in a resto-bar located along Tomas Morato Avenue in Quezon City after allegedly shouting and going amok at customers and staff members. Geisler insisted he did not cause trouble at the bar and accused the police of not following due process in arresting him. Geisler was charged with unjust vexation and alarm & scandal by the bar owner. Prior to the incident, Geisler also had a standing arrest warrant issued in Cebu for smoking inside a plane which violates the Civil Aviation Authority Act.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/938766/banned-baron-geisler-in-trouble-again-brother-apologizes|title='Banned' Baron Geisler in trouble again; brother apologizes|last=Enano|first=Jhesset O.|website=newsinfo.inquirer.net|language=en|access-date=2019-07-28}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/metro/629779/actor-baron-geisler-arrested-in-qc-resto-bar/story/|title=Actor Baron Geisler arrested in QC restobar|website=GMA News Online|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-28}}</ref> Geisler was released after a week.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rmn.ph/baron-geisler-planong-ipasok-sa-rehab-paglabas-ng-kulungan/|title=Baron Geisler, planong ipasok sa rehab paglabas ng kulungan|last=Nation|first=RMN News Nationwide: The Sound Of The|date=2017-10-18|website=RMN Networks|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-28}}</ref>\n\n====Brother-in-law altercation and arrest====\nOn March 3, 2018, Geisler posted a photo of his bruised face on his Instagram account, accusing a family member of beating him up due to financial matters. It was revealed that he got into a physical altercation with his brother in law Michael Robinstone Rodriguez Morales, husband of elder sister Grace Geisler-Morales, after allegedly displaying unruly intoxicated behavior inside Morales's house in Angeles City. According to Morales, he went to Geisler's house and confronted him about allegedly badmouthing his daughter (Geisler's niece) earlier on that day. Morales added that he was provoked by Geisler which resulted in a scuffle. Morales also posted a photo of their house being vandalized by Geisler.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/entertainment/03/05/18/barons-brother-in-law-speaks-up-he-asked-for-it-and-he-got-it|title=Baron's brother-in-law speaks up: He asked for it, and he got it|last=News|first=ABS-CBN|website=ABS-CBN News|access-date=2019-07-28}}</ref>\n\nOn March 5, 2018, Geisler was arrested after he allegedly \"threatened to kill\" Morales.
