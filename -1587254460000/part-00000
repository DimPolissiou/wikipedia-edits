It has two full-time employees: [[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob SquarePants]], who works as the [[chef|fry cook]]; and [[Squidward Tentacles]], who works as the [[cashier]].

However, it ended with failure for the [[Mongols]] and victory for Singhasari.\n\n==Background==\n[[Kublai Khan]], founder of the [[Yuan dynasty]], the principal khanate of the [[Mongol Empire]], had sent envoys to many states to ask them to put themselves under his protection and pay tribute.

The campaign also has other purpose. According to Kubilai khan himself, if the Mongol forces were able to defeat Java, the other countries around it would submit themselves.<ref name=\"yuan\" /> That way, the Yuan Mongol Dynasty could control the Asian sea trade routes, because of the strategic geographical position of the archipelago in trading.<ref name=\"mpm\" /> \n\nAccording to the ''[[History of Yuan|Yuan shi]]'', the history of the Yuan dynasty, 20,000\u201330,000 men were collected from [[Fujian]], [[Jiangxi]] and [[Huguang]] in Southern [[China]], along with 1,000 ships and enough provisions for a year.<ref>Weatherford (2004), and also Man (2007).</ref> The officers were the [[Mongol]] Shi-bi, the [[Yugur people|Uyghur]] Ike Mese, and the [[Chinese people|Chinese]] Gaoxing. \n\nMeanwhile, after defeating [[Melayu Kingdom|Malayu Dharmasraya]] in [[Sumatra]] in 1290, Singhasari became the most powerful kingdom in the region. Kertanegara sent a massive army to Sumatra in this [[Pamalayu]] campaign. However, seizing the opportunity of the lack of army guarding the capital, in 1292 [[Jayakatwang]], the duke of [[Kediri Kingdom|Kediri]] (Gelang-gelang), a vassal state of Singhasari, revolted against Kertanegara.

The king only realised the invasion from the north and sent his son-in-law, Nararya Sanggramawijaya ([[Raden Wijaya]]) northward to vanquish the rebellion. The northern attack was quashed, but the southern attack successfully remained undetected until they reached and sacked the unprepared capital city of Kutaraja. Jayakatwang usurped and killed Kertanagara during the [[Tantra]] sacred ceremony, thus bringing an end to the Singhasari kingdom.\n\nHaving learned of the fall of the Singhasari capital of Kutaraja to Kediri rebellion, Raden Wijaya tried to return and defend Singhasari but failed. He and his three colleagues, Ranggalawe, Sora and Nambi, went to exile to Madura under the protection of the regent Arya Wiraraja, Nambi's father, who then turned to Jayakatwang's side. Kertanegara's son-in-law, Raden Wijaya, submitted to Kediri, brokered by Arya Wiraraja and was pardoned by Jayakatwang. Wijaya was then given permission to establish a new settlement in Tarik timberland. The new settlement was named [[Majapahit]], which was taken from [[Aegle marmelos|''maja'' fruit]] that had a bitter taste in that timberland (''maja'' is the fruit name and ''pahit'' means bitter).\n\n=== Military composition ===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Studioportret van een krijgsman uit Djokja TMnr 60040120.jpg|thumb|upright|19th-century studio portrait of a native [[Javanese people|Javanese]] warrior with an iron [[kris]]-tipped spear (a ''[[Tombak (spear)|tombak]]'').

Light armor was deemed more suitable in Java than heavy armor, which is a tropical country, as noted by the Khan himself. The Yuan new army's armor rate was only 20%, and the Northern Chinese army's was slightly more. They had a lot of bows, shields and other ballistic weapons. The heavily armored infantry guards behind these were armed with a spear and a heavy axe. Mongolian soldiers also brought horses.

It is known that the Yuan forces stopped at Ko-lan ([[Biliton]]) to plan their strategy. In February 1293, Ike Mese departed first to bring the Emperor's order to Java. The main fleet then sailed to [[Karimunjawa|Karimun Jawa]], and from there sailed to Tuban. As noted in Kidung Panji-Wijayakrama, they probably looted the coastal village of [[Tuban]]. After that, the commanders decided to split the forces into two. The first will advance inland, the second will follow them using boats. Shi Bi sailed to the estuary of Sedayu, and from there went to a small river called [[Mas River|Kali Mas]] (which is a distributary of [[Brantas River|Brantas]] river). Land troops under Gao Xing and Ike Mese, which consist of cavalry and infantry, went to Du-Bing-Zu.

At the headwaters of the river was the palace of [[Tumapel]] ([[Singhasari]]) king. This river was the entryway to Java, and here they decided to battle. A Javanese minister blocked the river using boats. The Yuan commanders then made a crescent-shaped encampment at the bank of the river. They instructed the waterborne troops, cavalry and infantry to move forward together, scaring the Javanese minister. The minister abandoned his boats and fled in the night.

This was a [[punitive expedition]] against King [[Kertanegara]] of [[Singhasari]], who had refused to pay tribute to the Yuan and maimed one of its ministers. However, it ended with failure for the [[Mongols]] and victory for Singhasari.\n\n==Background==\n[[Kublai Khan]], founder of the [[Yuan dynasty]], the principal khanate of the [[Mongol Empire]], had sent envoys to many states to ask them to put themselves under his protection and pay tribute.

The campaign also has other purpose. According to Kubilai khan himself, if the Mongol forces were able to defeat Java, the other countries around it would submit themselves.<ref name=\"yuan\" /> That way, the Yuan Mongol Dynasty could control the Asian sea trade routes, because of the strategic geographical position of the archipelago in trading.<ref name=\"mpm\" /> \n\nAccording to the ''[[History of Yuan|Yuan shi]]'', the history of the Yuan dynasty, 20,000\u201330,000 men were collected from [[Fujian]], [[Jiangxi]] and [[Huguang]] in Southern [[China]], along with 1,000 ships and enough provisions for a year.<ref>Weatherford (2004), and also Man (2007).</ref> The officers were the [[Mongol]] Shi-bi, the [[Yugur people|Uyghur]] Ike Mese, and the [[Chinese people|Chinese]] Gaoxing. \n\nMeanwhile, after defeating [[Melayu Kingdom|Malayu Dharmasraya]] in [[Sumatra]] in 1290, Singhasari became the most powerful kingdom in the region. Kertanegara sent a massive army to Sumatra in this [[Pamalayu]] campaign. However, seizing the opportunity of the lack of army guarding the capital, in 1292 [[Jayakatwang]], the duke of [[Kediri Kingdom|Kediri]] (Gelang-gelang), a vassal state of Singhasari, revolted against Kertanegara.

The king only realised the invasion from the north and sent his son-in-law, Nararya Sanggramawijaya ([[Raden Wijaya]]) northward to vanquish the rebellion. The northern attack was quashed, but the southern attack successfully remained undetected until they reached and sacked the unprepared capital city of Kutaraja. Jayakatwang usurped and killed Kertanagara during the [[Tantra]] sacred ceremony, thus bringing an end to the Singhasari kingdom.\n\nHaving learned of the fall of the Singhasari capital of Kutaraja to Kediri rebellion, Raden Wijaya tried to return and defend Singhasari but failed. He and his three colleagues, Ranggalawe, Sora and Nambi, went to exile to Madura under the protection of the regent Arya Wiraraja, Nambi's father, who then turned to Jayakatwang's side. Kertanegara's son-in-law, Raden Wijaya, submitted to Kediri, brokered by Arya Wiraraja and was pardoned by Jayakatwang. Wijaya was then given permission to establish a new settlement in Tarik timberland. The new settlement was named [[Majapahit]], which was taken from [[Aegle marmelos|''maja'' fruit]] that had a bitter taste in that timberland (''maja'' is the fruit name and ''pahit'' means bitter).\n\n=== Military composition ===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Studioportret van een krijgsman uit Djokja TMnr 60040120.jpg|thumb|upright|19th-century studio portrait of a native [[Javanese people|Javanese]] warrior with an iron [[kris]]-tipped spear (a ''[[Tombak (spear)|tombak]]'').

Light armor was deemed more suitable in Java than heavy armor, which is a tropical country, as noted by the Khan himself. The Yuan new army's armor rate was only 20%, and the Northern Chinese army's was slightly more. They had a lot of bows, shields and other ballistic weapons. The heavily armored infantry guards behind these were armed with a spear and a heavy axe. Mongolian soldiers also brought horses. [[History of Yuan]] also mentioned the use of [[Gunpowder artillery in the Middle Ages|gunpowder weapons]], in the form of cannon (Chinese: ''[[Hu dun pao|Pao]]'').<ref name=\"yuan\" /> What kind of ships used for the campaign is not mentioned in the Yuanshi, but Worcester estimates that Yuan junks were 11 m (36 ft) in beam and over 30 m (100 ft) long.

This is now believed to be an exaggerated or mistaken number. Modern estimates place the Javanese forces at around the same size as the Mongol army, of around 20,000 to 30,000 men.<ref name=mpm/> Military forces in various parts of Southeast Asia were lightly armored. As is common in Southeast Asia, most of the Javanese forces were composed of temporarily conscripted commoners led by the warrior and noble castes.<ref name=\"yuan\" /> The Javanese navy, however, was more advanced than the Chinese. [[Javanese junk]]s were more than 50 m (164 ft) long, able to carry 500\u20131000 men, and constructed in multiple thick planks that rendered artillery useless.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Majapahit Peradaban Maritim|last=Nugroho|first=Irawan Djoko|publisher=Suluh Nuswantara Bakti|year=2011|isbn=9786029346008|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==Invasion==\nThe Yuan forces departed from the southern port of [[Quanzhou]],<ref name=chengho>{{Citation\n  | last =  Sen \n  | first = Tan Ta \n |author2=Dasheng Chen\n  | title = Cheng Ho and Islam in Southeast Asia\n  | publisher = Institute of Southeast Asian Studies\n  | date = 2009\n  | location = \n  | pages = 186\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=vIUmU2ytmIIC\n  | doi = \n  | id = \n  | isbn = 9789812308375}}</ref> traveled along the coast of [[Tr\u1ea7n dynasty]] [[Dai Viet]] and [[Champa]] along the way to their primary target.

It is known that the Yuan forces stopped at Ko-lan ([[Biliton]]) to plan their strategy. In February 1293, Ike Mese departed first to bring the Emperor's order to Java. The main fleet then sailed to [[Karimunjawa|Karimun Jawa]], and from there sailed to Tuban. As noted in Kidung Panji-Wijayakrama, they probably looted the coastal village of [[Tuban]]. After that, the commanders decided to split the forces into two. The first will advance inland, the second will follow them using boats. Shi Bi sailed to the estuary of Sedayu, and from there went to a small river called [[Mas River|Kali Mas]] (which is a distributary of [[Brantas River|Brantas]] river). Land troops under Gao Xing and Ike Mese, which consist of cavalry and infantry, went to Du-Bing-Zu. Three commanders sailed using fast boats from Sedayu to Majapahit's floating bridge and then joined with the main troops on the way to Kali Mas river.<ref name=\":2\" />{{Rp|112}}<ref name=\"sources\" />{{Rp|22}}\n\n[[File:YuanJunk(14thcentury).jpg|thumb|left|Painting of a 14th-century [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] [[Junk (ship)|junk]].

According to the Yuan-shi, Wijaya attacked Jayakatwang without success when he heard of the arrival of the Yuan navy. Then he requested their aid. In return, Yuan generals demanded his submission to their emperor, and he gave it.<ref name=\":2\" />{{Rp|113}}<ref name=\"sources\" />{{Rp|23}}\n\nOn the 1 March, all of the troops gathered in Kali Mas. At the headwaters of the river was the palace of [[Tumapel]] ([[Singhasari]]) king. This river was the entryway to Java, and here they decided to battle. A Javanese minister blocked the river using boats. The Yuan commanders then made a crescent-shaped encampment at the bank of the river. They instructed the waterborne troops, cavalry and infantry to move forward together, scaring the Javanese minister. The minister abandoned his boats and fled in the night.

He was called \"The Boy Wonder\" for his youth and ability to select scripts, choose actors, gather production staff, and make profitable films, including ''[[Grand Hotel (1932 film)|Grand Hotel]]'', ''[[China Seas (film)|China Seas]]'', ''[[Camille (1936 film)|Camille]]'', ''[[Mutiny on the Bounty (1935 film)|Mutiny on the Bounty]]'' and ''[[The Good Earth (film)|The Good Earth]]''. His films carved out an international market, \"projecting a seductive image of American life brimming with vitality and rooted in democracy and personal freedom,\" states biographer Roland Flamini.<ref name=Flamini />{{rp|3}}\n\nHe was born in Brooklyn, New York, and as a child was afflicted with a congenital heart disease that doctors said would kill him before he reached the age of thirty. After graduating from high school he worked as a store clerk during the day and to gain some job skills took a night class in typing. He then found work as a secretary with [[Universal Studios]]' New York office, and was later made studio manager for their Los Angeles facility. There, he oversaw production of a hundred films during his three years with the company. Among the films he produced was ''The Hunchback of Notre Dame.''\n\nIn Los Angeles, he partnered with [[Louis B. Mayer]]'s new studio and, after it merged with two other studios, helped create [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM). He was made head of production of MGM in 1925, at the age of twenty-six, helping MGM become the most successful studio in Hollywood. During his twelve years with MGM, until his early death at age 37, he produced four hundred films, most of which bore his imprint and innovations, including story conferences with writers, sneak previews to gain early feedback, and extensive re-shooting of scenes to improve the film. In addition, he introduced horror films to audiences and coauthored the \"[[Production Code]],\" guidelines for morality followed by all studios. During the 1920s and 1930s, he synthesized and merged the world of stage drama and literary classics with Hollywood films.\n\nThalberg created numerous new stars and groomed their screen images. Among them were [[Lon Chaney]], [[Ramon Novarro]], [[John Gilbert (actor)|John Gilbert]], [[Joan Crawford]], [[Clark Gable]], [[Jean Harlow]], [[Wallace Beery]], [[Luise Rainer]], [[Greta Garbo]], [[Lionel Barrymore]], and [[Norma Shearer]], who became his wife. He had the ability to combine quality with commercial success, and was credited with bringing his artistic aspirations in line with the demands of audiences. After his death, Hollywood's producers said he had been the world's \"foremost figure in motion-picture history.\" President Roosevelt wrote, \"The world of art is poorer with the passing of Irving Thalberg. His high ideals, insight and imagination went into the production of his masterpieces.\" The [[Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award]], given out periodically by the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] since 1937, has been awarded to producers whose body of work reflected consistently high quality films.<ref name=Hoberman />\n\n== Early years ==\nThalberg was born in [[Brooklyn]], to German Jewish immigrant parents, William and Henrietta (Haymann). Shortly after birth, he was diagnosed with \"[[blue baby syndrome]],\" caused by a congenital disease that limited the oxygen supply to his heart. The prognosis from the family's doctor and specialists was that he might live to age twenty, or at most, age thirty.<ref name=Vieira-1>Vieira, Mark A. ''Irving Thalberg: Boy Wonder to Producer Prince'', Univ. of California Press (2010)</ref>{{rp|3}}\n\nDuring his high school years in Brooklyn, he began having attacks of chest pains, dizziness and fatigue. This affected his ability to study, though until that time he was a good student. When he was 17, he contracted [[rheumatic fever]], and was confined to bed for a year. His mother, Henrietta, to prevent him falling too far behind other students, brought him homework from school, books, and tutors to teach him at home. She also hoped that the schoolwork and reading would distract him from the \"tantalizing sounds\" of children playing outside his window.<ref name=Vieira-1 />{{rp|4}}\n\nWith little to entertain him, he read books as a main activity.<ref>Feeley, Kathleen A.. [http://www.immigrantentrepreneurship.org/entry.php?rec=58 \"Irving Thalberg.\"] In ''Immigrant Entrepreneurship: German-American Business Biographies, 1720 to the Present'', vol. 4, edited by Jeffrey Fear. German Historical Institute. Last modified August 28, 2014.</ref> He devoured popular novels, classics, plays, and biographies. His books, of necessity, replaced the streets of New York, and led to his interest in classical philosophy and philosophers, such as [[William James]].<ref name=Vieira-1 />{{rp|4}}\n\nWhen Thalberg returned to school, he finished high school but lacked the stamina for college, which he felt would have required constant late-night studying and cramming for exams. Instead, he took part-time jobs as a store clerk, and in the evenings, to gain some job skills, taught himself typing, shorthand and Spanish at a night [[vocational school]].<ref name=Vieira-1 />{{rp|5}} When he turned 18, he placed an ad with the local newspaper hoping to find better work:\n\n{{quote|Situation Wanted: Secretary, stenographer, Spanish, English, high school education, no experience; $15.<ref name=obit />}}\n\n== Career as producer ==\n=== Universal Studios ===\nHe found work as an office secretary at Universal Pictures' New York office, and later became personal secretary to the studio's founder and president, [[Carl Laemmle]]. Among Thalberg's duties were transcribing and editing notes that Laemmle had written during screenings of his films. He earned $25 weekly, becoming adept at making insightful observations, which impressed Laemmle.\n\nLaemmle took Thalberg to see his Los Angeles production facility, where he spent a month watching how movie production worked. Before returning to New York, Laemmle told Thalberg to remain and \"keep an eye on things for me.\"<ref name=Vieira-1 />{{rp|7}} Two months later, Laemmle returned to California, partly to see how well Thalberg was able to handle the responsibilities he was given. Thalberg gave him suggestions, which impressed Laemmle by his ability to understand and explain problems.<ref name=Vieira-1 />{{rp|8}}\n\nThalberg suggested, \"The first thing you should do is establish a new job of studio manager and give him the responsibility of watching day-to-day operations.\" Laemmle immediately agreed, \"All right. You're it.\" In shock, Thalberg replied, \"I'm what?\" Laemmle told him to take charge of the Los Angeles studio, which he did in early 1919.<ref name=Vieira-1 />{{rp|8}} At age 20, Thalberg became responsible for immediately overseeing the nine ongoing film productions and nearly thirty scenarios then under development.<ref name=Vieira-1 />{{rp|8}}\n\nIn describing the rationale for this early appointment as studio manager, film historian [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]] writes that his new job \"owed nothing to nepotism, private wealth, or experience in the film industry.\" He reasons that despite \"Thalberg's youth, modest education, and frail appearance ... it is clear that he had the charm, insight, and ability, or the appearance of it, to captivate the film world.\"<ref name=Thomson>Thomson, David. ''The New Biographical Dictionary of Film'', Alfred A. Knopf, New York (2002) pp. 867\u2013868</ref>\n\nThalberg was one among the majority of Hollywood film industry workers who migrated from the East Coast, primarily from New York. Some film actors, such as [[Conrad Nagel]], did not like the 5-day train trip or the sudden warmth of the California climate. Neither did [[Marion Davies]], who was not used to such \"big wide spaces.\"<ref name=Vieira-1 />{{rp|9}} [[Samuel Marx]], a close friend of Thalberg's from New York, recalled how easily Thalberg adapted to Southern California, often standing outside his doorway during moments of contemplation to enjoy the scenery. \"We were all young,\" said comedian [[Buster Keaton]]. \"The air in California was like wine. Our business was also young\u2014and growing like nothing ever seen before.\"<ref name=Vieira-1 />{{rp|9}}\n\n==== Confrontation with Erich von Stroheim ====\nHe quickly established his tenacity as he battled with well-known director [[Erich von Stroheim]] over the length of ''[[Foolish Wives]]'' (1922). Biographer Roland Flamini notes that the film was Universal's most expensive \"jewel\" ever in production, and its director and star, von Stroheim, was taking the film way over budget. Thalberg, now Universal's general manager, was forced to have the director quickly finalize production before the studio's working capital was used up. Flamini describes the situation:<ref name=Flamini>Flamini, Roland. ''Thalberg: The Last Tycoon and the World of M-G-M'', Crown (1994)</ref>{{rp|30}}\n\n{{quote|The cost of that set alone had staggered Thalberg when he learned of it, but it was von Stroheim's obsessive spending on unnecessary detail that finally led to Thalberg's confrontation with the formidable director.}}\n\nThalberg had von Stroheim come to his office, which he did still wearing his film costume as a Russian Imperial Guard and escorted by members of his production team. Thalberg calmly told him, \"I have seen all the film and you have all you need for the picture. I want you to stop shooting,\" to which von Stroheim replied, \"But I have not finished as yet.\" \"Yes, you have,\" said Thalberg. \"You have spent all the money this company can afford. I cannot allow you to spend any more.\"<ref name=Vieira-1 />{{rp|13}}\n\nThalberg quietly explained that the director worked under the producer, and it was his responsibility to control costs. Von Stroheim, surrounded by his assistants, then confronted Thalberg: \"If you were not my superior, I would smash you in the face.\" Thalberg, unflinching, said \"Don't let that stop you.\"<ref name=Flamini />{{rp|32}} The result was that Thalberg soon after removed the cameras from von Stroheim's studio and took over editing. The uncut footage was pared down from five-and-a-half hours to three hours, to von Stroheim's deep dissatisfaction.\n\nA similar problem developed with von Stroheim's next film, ''Merry-Go-Round''. Although he had promised Thalberg to remain within budget this time, he continued production until it went to twice the agreed length and was not yet near completion. Flamini speculates why this happened:\n\n{{quote|Given his earlier problems with Thalberg, the director's behavior seemed suicidal. It's possible, however, that the idea of dismissal was simply unthinkable to him or that that he felt he could go over Thalberg's head to Laemmle, and the studio boss would surely want to keep his most prestigious director happy.<ref name=Flamini />{{rp|34}}}}\n\nThalberg again called von Stroheim to his office, handed him a long letter written and signed by himself, describing the problems, and summarily fired von Stroheim as of that moment. Thalberg's letter stated among the reasons,\n\n<blockquote>... totally inexcusable and repeated acts of insubordination ... extravagant ideas which you have been unwilling to sacrifice ... unnecessary delays ... and your apparent idea that you are greater and more powerful than the organization that employs you ...<ref name=Flamini />{{rp|35}}</blockquote>\n\nHis dismissal of von Stroheim was considered an \"earthquake in movie circles,\" notes Flamini. Producer [[David O. Selznick]] said that \"it was the first time a director had been fired. It took great guts and courage ... Von Stroheim was utterly indifferent over money and could have gone on and spent millions, with nobody to stop him.\".<ref name=Flamini />{{rp|36}} The opinion was shared by director [[Rouben Mamoulian]], who said that the \"little fellow at Universal,\" in one bold stroke, had \"asserted the primacy of the studio over the director\" and forever altered the balance of power in the movie industry.<ref name=Flamini />{{rp|36}}\n\n==== Effects of his young age ====\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Thalberg-sitting.jpg|thumb|<center>Thalberg, 1929</center>]] -->\nAccording to Flamini, his youth was a subject of conversation within the movie community. Executives from other studios, actors, and film crew, often mistook him to be a junior employee. Movie columnist [[Louella Parsons]], upon first being introduced to him, asked, \"What's the joke? Where's the new general manager?\" After five minutes of talking to Thalberg, however, she later wrote about \"Universal's Boy Wonder\": \"He might be a boy in looks and age, but it was no child's mind that was being asked to cope with the intricate politics of Universal City.\"<ref name=Flamini />{{rp|37}} Novelist [[Edna Ferber]] responded the same way, writing that \"I had fancied motion-picture producers as large gentlemen smoking oversized cigars. But this young man whose word seemed so final at Universal City ... impressed me deeply.\"<ref name=Vieira-1 />{{rp|9}}\n\nThe male actors in the studio had a similar reaction. [[Lionel Barrymore]], who was nearly twice his age, recalls their meetings:\n\n{{quote|I used to go into his office with the feeling I was addressing a boy. In a moment, I would be the one who felt young and inexperienced. I would feel he was not one, but all the forty disciples.<ref name=Thomas>Thomas, Bob. ''Thalberg: Life and Legend'', New Millennium Press (1969)</ref>{{rp|39}}}}\n\nThalberg likewise gained the respect of noted playwrights, some of whom also looked down on him due to his young age. [[George S. Kaufman]], co-author of ''Dinner at Eight'', various Marx Brothers films, and two George Gershwin plays, came from New York to meet with Thalberg. Afterwards he confided to his friend, [[Groucho Marx]]: \"That man has never written a word, yet he can tell me exactly what to do with a story. I didn't know you had people like that out here.\"<ref name=Vieira />{{rp|189}}\n\nActress [[Norma Shearer]], whom he later married, was surprised after he greeted her at the door, then walked her to his office for her first job interview: \"Then you're not the office boy?\" she asked. He smiled, as he sat himself behind his desk: \"No, Miss Shearer, I'm Irving Thalberg, vice-president of the Mayer Company. I'm the man who sent for you.\"<ref name=Thomas />{{rp|44}}\n\nHis younger-than-normal age for a studio executive was usually mentioned even after he left Universal to help start up MGM. Screenwriter [[Agnes Christine Johnson]], who worked with Thalberg for years, described his contribution during meetings:\n\n{{quote|He's so marvelous that no one who doesn't know him can believe it. Seeing him sitting in with all the important people, looking such a boy, and deferred to by everybody, you'd think that either they were crazy or you were. But if you stayed and listened, you'd understand. He has a mind like a whip. Snap! He has an idea\u2014the right idea\u2014the only idea!<ref name=Vieira-1 />{{rp|73}}}}\n\nThe same quality was observed by director and screenwriter [[Hobart Henley]]: \"If something that read well in conference turns out not so good on the screen, I go to him and, like that\u2014Henley snaps his fingers\u2014he has a remedy. He's brilliant.\"<ref name=Vieira-1 />{{rp|74}} Another assistant producer to Thalberg explains:\n\n{{quote|Irving had a sixth sense about a manuscript. He was a film doctor. You could go out [to a preview] with a film, and if there was something that didn't quite come off, he could put his finger on it. Some of the great films that came out of Metro were ''re''made at his suggestion. He had that uncanny ability.<ref name=Vieira />{{rp|59\u201360}}}}\n\nHis youth also contributed to his open-mindedness to the ideas of others. [[Conrad Nagel]], who starred in numerous Thalberg films, notes that Thalberg was generally empathetic to those he worked alongside: \"Thalberg never raised his voice. He just looked into your eyes, spoke softly, and after a few minutes he cast a spell on you.\"<ref name=Vieira-1 />{{rp|74}} Studio attorney Edwin Loeb, who also worked to create AMPAS, explained that \"the real foundation of Irving's success was his ability to look at life through the eyes of any given person. He had a gift of [[empathy]], and almost complete perspective.\"<ref name=Vieira-1 />{{rp|74}} Those opinions were also shared by producer [[Walter Wanger]]: \"You thought that you were talking to an Indian savant. He could cast a spell on anybody.\"<ref name=Hoberman />\n\nHis talent as a producer was enhanced by his \"near-miraculous\" powers of concentration, notes film critic [[J. Hoberman]].<ref name=Hoberman /> As a result, he was never bored or tired, and supplemented his spare time with reading for his own amusement, recalls screenwriter [[Bayard Veiller]], with some of his favorite authors being [[Francis Bacon]], [[Epictetus]], and [[Immanuel Kant]].<ref name=Hoberman />\n\n==== Film projects at Universal ====\n[[File:Hunchback -Notre Dame 1923.jpg|thumb|Lon Chaney in ''The Hunchback of Notre Dame'' (1923)]]\nBiographer Bob Thomas writes that after three years at the studio, Thalberg continually proved his value. Universal's pictures improved noticeably, primarily due to Thalberg's \"uncanny sense of story.\" He took tight control over many key aspects of production, including his requirement that from then on scripts were tightly constructed before filming began, rather than during production. Thomas adds that he also \"showed a remarkable capacity for working with actors, casting them aptly and advising them on their careers.\"<ref name=Thomas />{{rp|37}}\n\nAfter producing two films that had already been started when he began work at Universal, he presented Laemmle with his idea for a film based on one of his favorite classic stories, ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]''. Rather than just a horror picture, Thalberg suggested turning it into a spectacle which would include a replica of the famous [[Notre Dame de Paris|Cathedral of Notre Dame]] in Paris. He had [[Lon Chaney, Sr.|Lon Chaney]] play the hunchback. The film became Universal's most profitable silent film and established Chaney's career as a top-flight star.<ref name=Thomas />{{rp|36}}\n\nAfter nearly three years with Universal, Thalberg had supervised over a hundred movies, reorganized the studio to give more control to the managers, and had \"stopped the defection\" of many of their leading stars by offering them better, higher-paying contracts. He also produced a number of Universal's prestige films, which made the company profitable. However, he decided it was time to find a studio in Los Angeles more suitable to his skills, and spread word that he was available.<ref name=Flamini />{{rp|43}}\n\n=== Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) ===\n[[File:With Mayer-Shearer.jpg|thumb|Thalberg (left) with wife, Norma Shearer, and Louis B. Mayer, 1932]]\n[[Cecil B. DeMille]] was the first who wanted to hire him, telling his partner, [[Jesse Lasky]], \"The boy is a genius. I can see it. I know it.\" Lasky opposed the hire, stating, \"Geniuses we have all we need.\"<ref name=Flamini />{{rp|46}} Thalberg then received an offer from [[Hal Roach]], but the offer was withdrawn because Thalberg lacked experience with [[slapstick comedy]] films. In late 1922, Thalberg was introduced to [[Louis B. Mayer]], president of a small, but dynamic and fast-growing studio. At that first meeting, Thalberg \"made a deep, immediate impression on Mayer,\" writes Flamini. After Thalberg had left, Mayer said to studio attorney Edwin Loeb: \"Tell him if he comes to work for me, I'll look after him as though he were my son.\"<ref name=Flamini />{{rp|46}}\n\nAlthough their personalities were in many ways opposite, Mayer being more outspoken and nearly twice the younger man's age, Thalberg was hired as vice president in charge of production at [[Louis B. Mayer Productions]]. Years later, Mayer's daughter, [[Irene Mayer Selznick]], recalled that \"it was hard to believe anyone that boyish could be so important.\"<ref name=Flamini />{{rp|47}} According to Flamini, Thalberg was hired because, although Mayer was an astute businessman, \"what he lacked was Thalberg's almost unerring ability to combine quality with commercial success, to bring artistic aspiration in line with the demands of the box office.\"<ref name=Flamini />{{rp|47}} Mayer's company subsequently merged with two others to become [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM), with the 24-year-old Thalberg made part-owner and accorded the same position as vice president in charge of production. Three years after the merger, MGM became the most successful studio in Hollywood.\n\nDuring his twelve years at MGM, Thalberg supervised the production of over four hundred films. Although Thalberg and his colleagues at MGM knew he was \"doomed\" to not live much past age 30 due to heart disease, he loved producing films. He continued developing innovative ideas and overseeing most of MGM's pictures. Under Thalberg's management, MGM released over 40% more films yearly than [[Warner Brothers]], and more than double [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]]'s releases. From 1924 until 1936, when Thalberg died at age 37, \"almost every film bore Thalberg's imprint,\" notes Mark Vieira.<ref name=Vieira>Vieira, Mark A. ''Hollywood Dreams Made Real: Irving Thalberg and the Rise of M-G-M'', Abrams, New York (2008)</ref>{{rp|7}}\n\n==== Production innovations ====\n[[File:Thalberg-Shearer-Grauman-32.jpg|thumb|[[Sid Grauman]], [[Norma Shearer]], and Thalberg, 1932]]\nThalberg's production techniques \"broke new ground in filmmaking,\" adds Vieira. Among his contributions at MGM was his innovation of story conferences, sneak previews and scene retakes. He introduced the first horror films and coauthored the [[Production Code]], the set of moral guidelines that all film studios agreed to follow. Thalberg helped synthesize and merge the world of stage drama and literary classics with Hollywood films.<ref name=Vieira />{{rp|7}}\n\nMGM thereby became the only movie studio to consistently show a profit during America's [[Great Depression]].<ref name=Flamini />{{rp|6}} Flamini explains that the equation for MGM's success depended on combining stars, a Broadway hit or popular classic, and high standards of production. This combination at the time was considered a \"revolutionary approach\" in the film industry, which until then assumed a star was all that was needed for success, regardless of the story or production quality. The other studios began following MGM's lead with that same formula.<ref name=Flamini />{{rp|6}}\n\n==== Production techniques ====\nThalberg generally followed a system in managing his productions. According to one of his assistants, [[Lawrence Weingarten]], who later became a producer, \"Thalberg directed the film on paper, and then the director directed the film on film.\"<ref name=Vieira />{{rp|59}}\n\nThalberg was generally opposed to location shooting in foreign countries where he could not oversee production and control costs, as happened with ''Ben Hur''. He therefore kept hundreds of back lot carpenters at work creating realistic sets, as he did for fifteenth-century [[Romeo and Juliet (1936 film)|''Romeo and Juliet'']] (1936), or with [[China Seas (film)|''China Seas'']] (1935), to replicate the harbors of Hong Kong.<ref name=Flamini />{{rp|9}}\n\nVieira points out that Thalberg's \"fascination with Broadway plays\" often had him create and present stories visually.<ref name=Vieira-1 />{{rp|8}} For ''China Seas'', for instance, he described for the screenwriters, director and others, exactly how he wanted the film to appear on screen:\n\n{{quote|I'd like to open this sequence on a roaring gale at sea. ... I think it might be better to open just prior to the storm\u2014that awful calm before the storm ... and the typhoon hits and they go through all that hell, and the terrific tiredness after the fight is over\u2014the weariness of Gaskell [Clark Gable], and from behind him this China woman comes and their affair [begins].}}\n\nTo be certain of achieving the desired effects, Thalberg made sure his [[cinematographer]]s were careful in their use of light and shadow. Vieira observes that \"more than any other producer or any other studio, Thalberg and MGM manipulated lenses, filters, and lighting instruments to affect the viewer.\" As a result, he notes, \"most of Thalberg's films contain moments such as these, in which cinematic technique transcends mere exposition and gives the viewer something to treasure.\"<ref name=Vieira-1 />{{rp|8\u20139}}\n\nThalberg was supported by most of the studio in these kinds of creative decisions. \"It was a big family,\" notes Weingarten. \"If we had a success, everybody\u2014and I mean every cutter, every painter, every plasterer\u2014was excited about it, was abuzz, was in a tizzy about the whole idea of picture making.\"<ref name=Vieira />{{rp|59}}\n\n==== Taking risks with new subjects and stars ====\n{{quote box|align=right|width=25em|bgcolor = MistyRose|quote=A temperate man in all his ways of living, in this one respect he was an inveterate gambler. If he believed in a man, or a project, or a story, he would stake everything on his conviction. ... Everyone who worked for Thalberg loved him. He had the quality, rare among showmen, and precious among men, of standing back after an achievement and letting the other fellow take the credit ... he never wanted to be known as the big promoter. He just saw a little farther than most of the others, and trusted his vision, and worked like a laborer until it came true. ... What he also had was a great kindliness, a love for his work, workers, friends and audiences.|source= \u2014[[C. A. Lejeune]], film critic of the London ''Observer''<ref name=Thomas />{{rp|295}}}}\n\nIn 1929, MGM released fifty films, and all but five showed a profit. Of those that failed, ''[[Hallelujah (film)|Hallelujah]]'' in 1929 was also a gamble by Thalberg. When [[King Vidor]], the film's producer and director, proposed the idea to Thalberg of a major film cast, for the first time, exclusively with African Americans, he told Thalberg directly, \"I doubt that it will make a dollar at the box office.\" Thalberg replied, \"Don't worry about that. I've told you that MGM can afford an occasional experiment.\"<ref name=Vieira-1 />{{rp|105}}\n\nBy the early 1930s, a number of stars began failing at the box office, partly due to the Great Depression that was now undermining the economy, along with the public's ability to spend on entertainment. Thalberg began using two stars in a film, rather than one, as had been the tradition at all the studios, such as pairing [[Greta Garbo]] with [[John Gilbert (actor)|John Gilbert]], [[Clark Gable]] with [[Jean Harlow]], and [[William Powell]] with [[Myrna Loy]]. After experimenting with a few such films, including ''[[Mata Hari (1931 film)|Mata Hari]]'' in 1931, which were profitable, he decided on a multi-star production of another Broadway play, ''[[Grand Hotel (1932 film)|Grand Hotel]]'', later that same year. It had five major stars, including Garbo, [[Joan Crawford]], [[John Barrymore]], [[Lionel Barrymore]], and [[Wallace Beery]].<ref name=Flamini />{{rp|6}} \"Before Thalberg,\" writes Vieira, \"there was no ''Grand Hotel'' in the American consciousness.\"<ref name=Vieira-1 />{{rp|7}} The film won the Oscar for Best Picture in 1932.<ref name=Vieira-1 />{{rp|167}}\n\nThalberg went against consensus and took another risk with ''[[The Great Ziegfeld]]'' (1936), costarring [[Luise Rainer]]. Although Louis B. Mayer did not want her in the role, which he felt was too minor for a new star, Thalberg felt that \"only she could play the part\", notes biographer Charles Higham.<ref name=\"Higham\">Higham, Charles. ''Merchant of Dreams: Louis B. Mayer, M.G.M., and the Secret Hollywood'', Donald I. Fine, Inc. (1993)</ref>{{rp|240}} Shortly after shooting began in late 1935, doubts of Rainer's acting ability emerged in the press.<ref name=\"eyes\">\"Tantalizing Eyes Chief Appeal of Beautiful Luise Rainer\" by Dan Thomas, ''[[Pittsburgh Press]]'', October 28, 1935, p. 14</ref> However, despite her limited appearances in the film, Rainer \"so impressed audiences with one highly emotional scene\" that she won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]].<ref name=Affron>Affron, Charles, and Edelman, Rob. ''International Dictionary of Films and Filmmakers,'' St. James Press (1997) pp. 997\u2013999</ref>\n\nAfter her winning role in ''The Great Ziegfeld'', Thalberg wanted her to play a role that was the opposite of her previous character, for ''[[The Good Earth (film)|The Good Earth]]'' (1937). For the part as a Chinese peasant, she was required to act totally subservient to her husband, being perpetually huddled in submission, and barely spoke a word of dialogue during the entire film. Rainer recalls that Mayer did not approve of the film being produced or her part in it: \"He was horrified at Irving Thalberg's insistence for me to play O-lan, the poor uncomely little Chinese peasant.\"<ref name=Verswijver />{{rp|142}} However, she again won the Oscar for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]], becoming the first actress to win two consecutive Oscars, a feat not matched until [[Katharine Hepburn]]'s two Oscar wins thirty years later.<ref name=\"Affron\" />\n\n==== Grooming new stars ====\nBesides bringing a distinctive high quality \"look\" to MGM films and often recreating well-known stories or plays, Thalberg's actors themselves took on a characteristic quality. Thalberg wanted his female actors to appear \"cool, classy and beautiful,\" notes Flamini. And he strove to make the male actors appear \"worldly and in control.\" In general, Thalberg movies and actors came to be \"luxurious,\" \"glossy,\" and \"technically flawless.\"<ref name=Flamini />{{rp|8}} By doing so, he made stars of actors such as [[Lon Chaney]], [[Ramon Novarro]], [[John Gilbert (actor)|John Gilbert]], [[Greta Garbo]], [[Joan Crawford]], [[Clark Gable]], [[Helen Hayes]], [[Jean Harlow]], [[Marie Dressler]], [[Wallace Beery]], [[John Barrymore]], [[Lionel Barrymore]] and [[Luise Rainer]].<ref name=Vieira-1 />{{rp|7}}\n\n;Luise Rainer\n[[Luise Rainer]], under his guidance, became the first star to win two consecutive Academy Awards as Best Actress. After Thalberg's sudden death during production of [[The Good Earth (film)|''The Good Earth'']] (1937), her film career went into decline from being given a string of bad parts, and she gave up her film career. Rainer commented years later, \"His dying was a terrible shock to us. He was young and ever so able. Had it not been that he died, I think I may have stayed much longer in films.\"<ref name=Verswijver>Verswijver, Leo. ''Movies Were Always Magical'', McFarland Publ. (2003) p. 142</ref>\n\n;Greta Garbo\nIn 1925, a young [[Greta Garbo]], then twenty, and unable to speak any English, was brought over from Sweden at Mayer's request, as he saw how she looked in still photos. A Swedish friend thought he would help her by contacting Thalberg, who then agreed to give her a screen test. According to author Frederick Sands, \"the result of the test was electrifying.\" Thalberg was impressed and began grooming the new starlet the following day: \"the studio arranged to fix her teeth, made sure she lost weight, and gave her an English tutor.\"<ref name=Sands>Sands, Frederick. ''The Divine Garbo'', Grosset & Dunlap (1979) pp. 69\u201373</ref>\n;Joan Crawford\n[[Joan Crawford]]'s first role was a Thalberg production at MGM and she became one of their leading stars for the next thirty years. She felt that his contribution to MGM was vital to the film industry. Not long after his early death, she recalls her concerns: \"Thalberg was dead and the concept of the quality 'big' picture pretty much went out the window.\"<ref>Leider, Emily W. ''Myrna Loy: The Only Good Girl in Hollywood'', Univ. of California Press (2011) p. 184</ref>\n\n;Marie Dressler\nThalberg also realized that old stars few had heard of could be made into new ones. [[Marie Dressler]], a fifty-nine-year-old early [[vaudeville]] star, was unable to get any roles in films. MGM screenwriter Frances Marion suggested to Thalberg that she might fit well in a starring role for a new film, and was surprised when he knew of her prior successes. Thalberg approved of using her without a screen test and offered his rationale:\n\n{{quote|My theory is that anybody who once hits the bull's-eye\u2014it doesn't matter in what profession\u2014has the brains and stamina to stage a comeback. So I figure that a woman who held the spotlight for so many years has been the victim of bad writing\u2014and probably a lot of bad advice.<ref name=Vieira-1 />{{rp|72}}}}\n\nBy 1932, shortly before she died, Dressler was the country's number one box office star.\n\n==== Getting audience feedback and reshooting ====\nAccording to Vieira, MGM had few failures during this period, and numerous blockbusters. Among the reasons was Thalberg's unique system of developing a script during story conferences with writers before filming began, and later giving \"sneak previews\" followed by audience feedback through written questionnaires. Often, where he felt improvement was needed, he arranged for scenes to be reshot. As Thalberg once stated, \"The difference between something good and something superior is often very small.\"<ref name=Vieira-1 />{{rp|50}}\n\n==== Bad decisions and missed opportunities ====\nThalberg felt he had his \"finger on the pulse of America. I know what people will do and what they won't do,\" he said.<ref name=\"friedrich1997\">{{cite book | title=City of Nets: A Portrait of Hollywood in 1940s | publisher=University of California Press | author=Friedrich, Otto | year=1997 | edition=reprint | location=Berkeley and Los Angeles | pages=[https://archive.org/details/cityofnetsportra00frie/page/16 16\u201317] | isbn=0-520-20949-4 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/cityofnetsportra00frie/page/16 }}</ref> His judgment was not always accurate, however. Thalberg's bringing Broadway productions to the screen to develop higher picture standards sometimes resulted in \"studied\" acting or \"stagey\" sets, notes Flamini.<ref name=Flamini />{{rp|6}} In 1927, after the successful release of the first full-length talking picture, ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'' (1927), he nevertheless felt that talking pictures were a fad. Thalberg likewise did not think that color would replace black-and-white in movies.<ref name=Vieira-1 />{{rp|71}}\n\nWhen an assistant protested against a script that envisioned a love scene in Paris with an ocean background, Thalberg refused to make changes, saying \"We can't cater to a handful of people who know Paris.\"{{r|friedrich1997}} A more serious distraction to Thalberg's efforts was his obsession with making his wife [[Norma Shearer]] a prominent star, efforts which sometimes led to \"overblown and overglamous\" productions.<ref name=Flamini />{{rp|7}} Thalberg himself admitted to his obsession years later when he told a fellow producer: \"You're behaving like I did with Norma. I knew positively that she could play anything. It's a kind of romantic astigmatism that attacks producers when they fall for an actress.\"<ref name=Vieira-1 />{{rp|201}}\n\n==== Important films at MGM ====\n===== ''Ben Hur'' (1925) =====\n[[File:Ben Hur race.jpg|thumb|Scene from ''Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ'' (1925)]]\nOne of the first pictures he took charge of, ''[[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ (1925 film)|Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ]]'', was inherited and already in production by another studio when MGM was formed. The film was turning into a disastrous expense with cost overruns already in the millions due to its lavish sets and location shooting in Rome. Most studio executives chose to terminate the film to cut their losses. Thalberg, however, felt differently, and thought the film would affect movie audiences, due to its classic literary source, and would highlight MGM as a major new studio.\n\nHe, therefore, discarded much of the original footage shot in Italy and recreated the set on MGM's back lots in Culver City, which added more millions to the production, yet gave him more control over production. The new set also included a replica of [[Circus Maximus]] for the dramatic chariot race scenes. Flamini notes that Thalberg's \"gamble paid off,\" drawing international attention to MGM, and to Thalberg within the movie industry for his bold action.<ref name=Flamini />{{rp|5}}\n\n===== ''Mutiny on the Bounty'' (1935) =====\n[[Mutiny on the Bounty (1935 film)|''Mutiny on the Bounty'']] was the studio's next most expensive film after ''Ben Hur'', with some now calling it \"Thalberg's masterpiece.\"<ref name=examiner>Wiebe, Charles. \"Mutiny on the Bounty: Irving Thalberg's Masterpiece\", ''Examiner.com, May 11, 2016</ref> He initially had difficulty convincing Mayer that he could make the film without making heroes of the mutineers. He achieved that by instead making a hero of the British Royal Navy, whereby the officers and shipmates would from then on display their mutual respect. Thalberg also had to convince Clark Gable to accept the role against his will. He pleaded with Gable, eventually promising him that \"If it isn't one of your greatest successes, I'll never ask you again to play a part you don't want.\"<ref name=examiner /> The film's other main stars were [[Charles Laughton]] and [[Franchot Tone]]. The film was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Actor, and winning it for Best Picture. Thalberg accepted the award as producer from [[Frank Capra]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUcBWCprqKI \"''Mutiny on the Bounty'' wins the 1935 Academy Award for Best Picture\"]</ref>\n\n==== Thalberg and Mayer partnership ====\nAt first, Thalberg and studio chief [[Louis B. Mayer]] got along splendidly; however, they had different production philosophies. Thalberg preferred literary works, while Mayer preferred glitzy crowd-pleasing films. A clash was inevitable, and their relationship grew decidedly frosty. When Thalberg fell ill in the final weeks of 1932, Mayer took advantage of the situation and replaced him with [[David O. Selznick]] and [[Walter Wanger]]. Thalberg's reputation by that time for working long hours was widely known, and rumors about the related strain on his fragile health had become front-page news in entertainment trade publications. ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' in January 1933 updated its readership about his condition and addressed growing concerns that he might be forced, despite his young age, to quit the business:\n\n{{quote|In an effort to quiet rumors zooming throughout the industry, indicating that Irving Thalberg would be compelled to retire permanently as production head of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and take a long rest, a reporter from this publication got in touch with his physician yesterday for a statement as to the real condition of Mr. Thalberg. Dr. Philip Newmark stated:\n\n<blockquote>Mr. Thalberg had a heavy attack of [[influenza]] that lasted several days and, although he was quite ill, he recovered nicely. However, he is far from being in good condition, he is all tired out and needs rest. I want him to take a rest for several weeks. I do not consider it necessary, at this time, to send him away, as he is quite comfortable at home.</blockquote>\n\nAsked about the report that Thalberg had suffered a violent heart attack, Dr. Newmark replied: \"Mr. Thalberg's heart has not been any too strong and that is another reason why I have insisted that he take a long rest.<ref>[http://archive.org/stream/hollywoodreporte1215wilk#page/n13/mode/2up \"'Thalberg Needs Rest,' Declares His Physician\"], ''The Hollywood Reporter'' (Los Angeles, California), January 5, 1933, pages 1-2. [[Internet Archive]], San Francisco, California. Retrieved August 20, 2018.</ref>}}\n\nOnce Thalberg recovered sufficiently from his bout with the \"flu\" and was able to return to work later in 1933, it was as one of MGM's unit producers, albeit one who had first choice on projects as well as preferential access to all the studio's resources, most notably its stars. Thalberg's close relationship to [[Nicholas Schenck]], then president of [[Loew's Incorporated]], proved to be an ongoing advantage for him. Loew's was the corporate parent of MGM, so Schenck was the true power and ultimate arbiter at the studio; and he usually supported Thalberg's decisions and continued to do so whenever disagreements about projects or production needs arose. As a result, Thalberg also continued to produce or coproduce some of MGM's most prestigious and critically acclaimed ventures in this period, such as ''[[The Barretts of Wimpole Street (1934 film)|The Barretts of Wimpole Street]]'' starring his wife [[Norma Shearer]] (1934), ''[[Mutiny on the Bounty (1935 film)|Mutiny on the Bounty]]'' (1935), ''[[China Seas (film)|China Seas]]'' (1935), ''[[A Night at the Opera (film)|A Night at the Opera]]'' (1935), ''[[San Francisco (1936 film)|San Francisco]]'' (1936), and ''[[Romeo and Juliet (1936 film)|Romeo and Juliet]]'' (1936).\n\n== Personal life ==\nDuring his few years with Universal while living in New York, Thalberg had become romantically involved with Carl Laemmle's daughter, Rosabelle. Still in his early twenties and later spending most of his time in Los Angeles, his feelings toward her were no longer as strong. Flamini suspects that this may have affected his position at Universal and partly caused his decision to leave the company. \" The Laemmles prayed that Irving would marry Rosabelle,\" notes Flamini. \"They wanted their sons to be educated and their daughters to marry nice Jewish boys.\"<ref name=Flamini />{{rp|45}}\n\n[[File:Thalberg-Shearer.jpg|left|thumb|With wife actress [[Norma Shearer]], July 1936]]\nLess than a year after he and Mayer took charge of the newly created MGM studios, and still only twenty-five years old, Thalberg suffered a serious heart attack due to overwork. Mayer also became aware of Thalberg's congenital heart problems and now worried about the prospect of running MGM without him. Mayer also became concerned that one of his daughters might become romantically involved, and told them so:\n\n{{quote|He's attractive. I don't want you girls getting any ideas in your heads, ever. ... I don't want to have a young widow on my hands.<ref name=Flamini />{{rp|49}}}}\n\nThalberg, aware of Mayer's feelings, made it a point of never giving too much attention to his daughters at social events.\n\nOne of Thalberg's traits was his ability to work long hours into the night with little sign of fatigue. According to Vieira, Thalberg believed that as long as his mind was active in his work and he was not bored, he would not feel tired. Thalberg, who often got by with only five hours of sleep, felt that most people could get by with less than they realized.<ref name=Vieira-1 />{{rp|74}} To keep his mental faculties at peak, he would read philosophical books by Bacon, Epictetus, or Kant. \"They stimulate me. I'd drop out of sight in no time if I didn't read and keep up with current thought\u2014and the philosophers are brain sharpeners.\"\n\nDuring the early 1930s, Thalberg was ambivalent about political events in Europe. While he feared Nazism and the rise of Hitler, he also feared Communism. At the time, notes Vieira, \"given a choice between communism and fascism, many Americans\u2014including Thalberg\u2014would prefer the latter.\"<ref name=Vieira-1 />{{rp|309}} Thalberg stated his opinion:\n\n{{quote|When a dictator dies, his system dies, too. But if communism is allowed to spread, it will be harder to root out. What is at stake is our whole way of life, our freedom. They will have vanished forever.<ref name=Vieira-1 />{{rp|309}}}}\n\nWhen others suggested that many Jews could die in Germany as a result of Nazi anti-Semitism, he replied that in his opinion \"Hitler and Hitlerism will pass.\" On one occasion, Catholic [[Hubertus, Prince of L\u00f6wenstein-Wertheim-Freudenberg|Prince Lowenstein]] of Germany, who himself had almost been captured before fleeing Germany, told him: \"Mr. Thalberg, your own people are being systematically hunted down and rooted out of Germany.\" Thalberg suggested that world Jewry should nevertheless not interfere, that the Jewish race would survive Hitler.<ref name=Flamini />{{rp|181}}<ref name=Vieira-1 />{{rp|310}} Within a few years.

A few weeks earlier, Thalberg's leading screenwriter, Al Lewin, had proposed doing a film based on a soon-to-be published book, ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone with the Wind]]''. Although Thalberg said it would be a \"sensational\" role for Gable, and a \"terrific picture,\" he decided not to do it:\n\n{{quote|Look, I have just made ''Mutiny on the Bounty'' and ''The Good Earth''.

The ushers who led them to their seats included [[Clark Gable]], [[Fredric March]], and playwright [[Moss Hart]]. [[Erich von Stroheim]], who had been fired by Thalberg, came to pay his respects.

He notes that with his numerous production innovations and grand stories, often turning classic literature and Broadway stage productions into big-screen pictures, he managed to keep \"American movies supreme throughout the world for a generation.\" [[Darryl F. Zanuck]], founder of [[20th Century Fox]], said that during Thalberg's brief career, he had become the \"most creative producer in the history of films.\"<ref name=Thomas />{{rp|299}} Thomas describes some of his contributions:\n\n{{quote|The touchstone of his genius was quality, the unceasing pursuit of quality.

He closely supervised the making of \"more pictures than any other producer in Hollywood's history,\" and was considered the \"archetype of the creative producer,\" adds Flamini. Upon his early death at age 37, a ''New York Times'' editorial called him \"the most important force\" in the motion picture industry.

I've long chosen him for a hero (this has been in my mind for three years) because he is one of the half-dozen men I have known who were built on a grand scale.\"<ref name=Thomas />{{rp|8}}\n\nThomas notes that among the reasons Fitzgerald chose to write a book about a Thalberg-like character, was that \"throughout his literary career, Fitzgerald borrowed his heroes from friends he admired, and inevitably a bit of Fitzgerald entered the characterizations.\" Fitzgerald himself writes that \"When I like men, I want to be like them ...\" Fitzgerald and Thalberg had real life similarities: both were prodigies, each had heart ailments, and they both died at early ages.<ref name=Thomas />{{rp|8}}\n\nAccording to biographer [[Matthew J. Bruccoli]], Fitzgerald believed that Thalberg, with his \"taste and courage, represented the best of Hollywood. ... [and] saw Thalberg as a model for what could be done in the movies.\"<ref name=Bruccoli /> Fitzgerald died before the novel was completed, however. Bruccoli writes of Fitzgerald's book:\n\n{{quote|Nurturing a heroic sense of American character, he found his essential American figure in his last novel. ... So thorough was Fitzgerald's identification with his hero that Stahr stands among the most compelling Jewish characters in American fiction.<ref name=Bruccoli />}}\n\nAlthough parallels between Monroe Stahr in the novel and Thalberg were evident, many who knew Thalberg intimately stated that they did not see similarities in their personalities.<ref name=Thomas />{{rp|13}} Norma Shearer said that the Stahr character was not at all like her former husband.<ref name=Bruccoli>Bruccoli, Matthew J. ''Some Sort of Epic Grandeur: The Life of F. Scott Fitzgerald'', Harcourt Brace Jovanovich (1981) pp. 466\u2013468</ref>\n\nIn the 1976 [[The Last Tycoon (1976 film)|film version]], directed by [[Elia Kazan]], Monroe Stahr was played by [[Robert De Niro]]. Kazan, in his pre-production notes, described the Stahr character as he saw him:\n\n{{quote|Stahr is special, unique, monastic, a relic. He walks alone. Occasionally men follow him waiting for orders. He is in a daze of work and thought. He carries the whole studio operation in his head.<ref>Kazan, Elia. ''Kazan on Directing'', Random House (2009) p. 229</ref>}}\n\nIn the [[The Last Tycoon (TV series)|2016 television series]] based on the novel, Monroe Stahr is played by [[Matt Bomer]].\n\n=== Others ===\nFitzgerald also based his short story \"[[Crazy Sunday]],\" originally published in the October 1932 issue of ''[[American Mercury]]'', on an incident he witnessed at a party thrown by Thalberg and Shearer. The story is included in Fitzgerald's collection ''[[Taps at Reveille]]'' (1935).\n\nThalberg was portrayed in the movie ''[[Man of a Thousand Faces (film)|Man of a Thousand Faces]]'' (1957) by [[Robert Evans]], who appropriately enough went on to become a studio head himself.\n\nThalberg was portrayed by Bill Cusack in ''Young Indiana Jones and the Hollywood Follies'' (1994), a TV film based on ''[[The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles]]'', in which [[Indiana Jones]] is depicted as taking part in Thalberg's conflict with Erich von Stroheim over ''Foolish Wives''.\n\n== Filmography

He was called \"The Boy Wonder\" for his youth and ability to select scripts, choose actors, gather production staff, and make profitable films, including ''[[Grand Hotel (1932 film)|Grand Hotel]]'', ''[[China Seas (film)|China Seas]]'', ''[[Camille (1936 film)|Camille]]'', ''[[Mutiny on the Bounty (1935 film)|Mutiny on the Bounty]]'' and ''[[The Good Earth (film)|The Good Earth]]''. His films carved out an international market, \"projecting a seductive image of American life brimming with vitality and rooted in democracy and personal freedom,\" states biographer Roland Flamini.<ref name=Flamini />{{rp|3}}\n\nHe was born in Brooklyn, New York, and as a child was afflicted with a congenital heart disease that doctors said would kill him before he reached the age of thirty. After graduating from high school he worked as a store clerk during the day and to gain some job skills took a night class in typing. He then found work as a secretary with [[Universal Studios]]' New York office, and was later made studio manager for their Los Angeles facility. There, he oversaw production of a hundred films during his three years with the company. Among the films he produced was ''The Hunchback of Notre Dame.''\n\nIn Los Angeles, he partnered with [[Louis B. Mayer]]'s new studio and, after it merged with two other studios, helped create [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM). He was made head of production of MGM in 1925, at the age of twenty-six, helping MGM become the most successful studio in Hollywood. During his twelve years with MGM, until his early death at age 37, he produced four hundred films, most of which bore his imprint and innovations, including story conferences with writers, sneak previews to gain early feedback, and extensive re-shooting of scenes to improve the film. In addition, he introduced horror films to audiences and coauthored the \"[[Production Code]],\" guidelines for morality followed by all studios. During the 1920s and 1930s, he synthesized and merged the world of stage drama and literary classics with Hollywood films.\n\nThalberg created numerous new stars and groomed their screen images. Among them were [[Lon Chaney]], [[Ramon Novarro]], [[John Gilbert (actor)|John Gilbert]], [[Joan Crawford]], [[Clark Gable]], [[Jean Harlow]], [[Wallace Beery]], [[Luise Rainer]], [[Greta Garbo]], [[Lionel Barrymore]], and [[Norma Shearer]], who became his wife. He had the ability to combine quality with commercial success, and was credited with bringing his artistic aspirations in line with the demands of audiences. After his death, Hollywood's producers said he had been the world's \"foremost figure in motion-picture history.\" President Roosevelt wrote, \"The world of art is poorer with the passing of Irving Thalberg. His high ideals, insight and imagination went into the production of his masterpieces.\" The [[Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award]], given out periodically by the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] since 1937, has been awarded to producers whose body of work reflected consistently high quality films.<ref name=Hoberman />\n\n== Early years ==\nThalberg was born in [[Brooklyn]], to German Jewish immigrant parents, William and Henrietta (Haymann). Shortly after birth, he was diagnosed with \"[[blue baby syndrome]],\" caused by a congenital disease that limited the oxygen supply to his heart. The prognosis from the family's doctor and specialists was that he might live to age twenty, or at most, age thirty.<ref name=Vieira-1>Vieira, Mark A. ''Irving Thalberg: Boy Wonder to Producer Prince'', Univ. of California Press (2010)</ref>{{rp|3}}\n\nDuring his high school years in Brooklyn, he began having attacks of chest pains, dizziness and fatigue. This affected his ability to study, though until that time he was a good student. When he was 17, he contracted [[rheumatic fever]], and was confined to bed for a year. His mother, Henrietta, to prevent him falling too far behind other students, brought him homework from school, books, and tutors to teach him at home. She also hoped that the schoolwork and reading would distract him from the \"tantalizing sounds\" of children playing outside his window.<ref name=Vieira-1 />{{rp|4}}\n\nWith little to entertain him, he read books as a main activity.<ref>Feeley, Kathleen A.. [http://www.immigrantentrepreneurship.org/entry.php?rec=58 \"Irving Thalberg.\"] In ''Immigrant Entrepreneurship: German-American Business Biographies, 1720 to the Present'', vol. 4, edited by Jeffrey Fear. German Historical Institute. Last modified August 28, 2014.</ref> He devoured popular novels, classics, plays, and biographies. His books, of necessity, replaced the streets of New York, and led to his interest in classical philosophy and philosophers, such as [[William James]].<ref name=Vieira-1 />{{rp|4}}\n\nWhen Thalberg returned to school, he finished high school but lacked the stamina for college, which he felt would have required constant late-night studying and cramming for exams. Instead, he took part-time jobs as a store clerk, and in the evenings, to gain some job skills, taught himself typing, shorthand and Spanish at a night [[vocational school]].<ref name=Vieira-1 />{{rp|5}} When he turned 18, he placed an ad with the local newspaper hoping to find better work:\n\n{{quote|Situation Wanted: Secretary, stenographer, Spanish, English, high school education, no experience; $15.<ref name=obit />}}\n\n== Career as producer ==\n=== Universal Studios ===\nHe found work as an office secretary at Universal Pictures' New York office, and later became personal secretary to the studio's founder and president, [[Carl Laemmle]]. Among Thalberg's duties were transcribing and editing notes that Laemmle had written during screenings of his films. He earned $25 weekly, becoming adept at making insightful observations, which impressed Laemmle.\n\nLaemmle took Thalberg to see his Los Angeles production facility, where he spent a month watching how movie production worked. Before returning to New York, Laemmle told Thalberg to remain and \"keep an eye on things for me.\"<ref name=Vieira-1 />{{rp|7}} Two months later, Laemmle returned to California, partly to see how well Thalberg was able to handle the responsibilities he was given. Thalberg gave him suggestions, which impressed Laemmle by his ability to understand and explain problems.<ref name=Vieira-1 />{{rp|8}}\n\nThalberg suggested, \"The first thing you should do is establish a new job of studio manager and give him the responsibility of watching day-to-day operations.\" Laemmle immediately agreed, \"All right. You're it.\" In shock, Thalberg replied, \"I'm what?\" Laemmle told him to take charge of the Los Angeles studio, which he did in early 1919.<ref name=Vieira-1 />{{rp|8}} At age 20, Thalberg became responsible for immediately overseeing the nine ongoing film productions and nearly thirty scenarios then under development.<ref name=Vieira-1 />{{rp|8}}\n\nIn describing the rationale for this early appointment as studio manager, film historian [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]] writes that his new job \"owed nothing to nepotism, private wealth, or experience in the film industry.\" He reasons that despite \"Thalberg's youth, modest education, and frail appearance ... it is clear that he had the charm, insight, and ability, or the appearance of it, to captivate the film world.\"<ref name=Thomson>Thomson, David. ''The New Biographical Dictionary of Film'', Alfred A. Knopf, New York (2002) pp. 867\u2013868</ref>\n\nThalberg was one among the majority of Hollywood film industry workers who migrated from the East Coast, primarily from New York. Some film actors, such as [[Conrad Nagel]], did not like the 5-day train trip or the sudden warmth of the California climate. Neither did [[Marion Davies]], who was not used to such \"big wide spaces.\"<ref name=Vieira-1 />{{rp|9}} [[Samuel Marx]], a close friend of Thalberg's from New York, recalled how easily Thalberg adapted to Southern California, often standing outside his doorway during moments of contemplation to enjoy the scenery. \"We were all young,\" said comedian [[Buster Keaton]]. \"The air in California was like wine. Our business was also young\u2014and growing like nothing ever seen before.\"<ref name=Vieira-1 />{{rp|9}}\n\n==== Confrontation with Erich von Stroheim ====\nHe quickly established his tenacity as he battled with well-known director [[Erich von Stroheim]] over the length of ''[[Foolish Wives]]'' (1922). Biographer Roland Flamini notes that the film was Universal's most expensive \"jewel\" ever in production, and its director and star, von Stroheim, was taking the film way over budget. Thalberg, now Universal's general manager, was forced to have the director quickly finalize production before the studio's working capital was used up. Flamini describes the situation:<ref name=Flamini>Flamini, Roland. ''Thalberg: The Last Tycoon and the World of M-G-M'', Crown (1994)</ref>{{rp|30}}\n\n{{quote|The cost of that set alone had staggered Thalberg when he learned of it, but it was von Stroheim's obsessive spending on unnecessary detail that finally led to Thalberg's confrontation with the formidable director.}}\n\nThalberg had von Stroheim come to his office, which he did still wearing his film costume as a Russian Imperial Guard and escorted by members of his production team. Thalberg calmly told him, \"I have seen all the film and you have all you need for the picture. I want you to stop shooting,\" to which von Stroheim replied, \"But I have not finished as yet.\" \"Yes, you have,\" said Thalberg. \"You have spent all the money this company can afford. I cannot allow you to spend any more.\"<ref name=Vieira-1 />{{rp|13}}\n\nThalberg quietly explained that the director worked under the producer, and it was his responsibility to control costs. Von Stroheim, surrounded by his assistants, then confronted Thalberg: \"If you were not my superior, I would smash you in the face.\" Thalberg, unflinching, said \"Don't let that stop you.\"<ref name=Flamini />{{rp|32}} The result was that Thalberg soon after removed the cameras from von Stroheim's studio and took over editing. The uncut footage was pared down from five-and-a-half hours to three hours, to von Stroheim's deep dissatisfaction.\n\nA similar problem developed with von Stroheim's next film, ''Merry-Go-Round''. Although he had promised Thalberg to remain within budget this time, he continued production until it went to twice the agreed length and was not yet near completion. Flamini speculates why this happened:\n\n{{quote|Given his earlier problems with Thalberg, the director's behavior seemed suicidal. It's possible, however, that the idea of dismissal was simply unthinkable to him or that that he felt he could go over Thalberg's head to Laemmle, and the studio boss would surely want to keep his most prestigious director happy.<ref name=Flamini />{{rp|34}}}}\n\nThalberg again called von Stroheim to his office, handed him a long letter written and signed by himself, describing the problems, and summarily fired von Stroheim as of that moment. Thalberg's letter stated among the reasons,\n\n<blockquote>... totally inexcusable and repeated acts of insubordination ... extravagant ideas which you have been unwilling to sacrifice ... unnecessary delays ... and your apparent idea that you are greater and more powerful than the organization that employs you ...<ref name=Flamini />{{rp|35}}</blockquote>\n\nHis dismissal of von Stroheim was considered an \"earthquake in movie circles,\" notes Flamini. Producer [[David O. Selznick]] said that \"it was the first time a director had been fired. It took great guts and courage ... Von Stroheim was utterly indifferent over money and could have gone on and spent millions, with nobody to stop him.\".<ref name=Flamini />{{rp|36}} The opinion was shared by director [[Rouben Mamoulian]], who said that the \"little fellow at Universal,\" in one bold stroke, had \"asserted the primacy of the studio over the director\" and forever altered the balance of power in the movie industry.<ref name=Flamini />{{rp|36}}\n\n==== Effects of his young age ====\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Thalberg-sitting.jpg|thumb|<center>Thalberg, 1929</center>]] -->\nAccording to Flamini, his youth was a subject of conversation within the movie community. Executives from other studios, actors, and film crew, often mistook him to be a junior employee. Movie columnist [[Louella Parsons]], upon first being introduced to him, asked, \"What's the joke? Where's the new general manager?\" After five minutes of talking to Thalberg, however, she later wrote about \"Universal's Boy Wonder\": \"He might be a boy in looks and age, but it was no child's mind that was being asked to cope with the intricate politics of Universal City.\"<ref name=Flamini />{{rp|37}} Novelist [[Edna Ferber]] responded the same way, writing that \"I had fancied motion-picture producers as large gentlemen smoking oversized cigars. But this young man whose word seemed so final at Universal City ... impressed me deeply.\"<ref name=Vieira-1 />{{rp|9}}\n\nThe male actors in the studio had a similar reaction. [[Lionel Barrymore]], who was nearly twice his age, recalls their meetings:\n\n{{quote|I used to go into his office with the feeling I was addressing a boy. In a moment, I would be the one who felt young and inexperienced. I would feel he was not one, but all the forty disciples.<ref name=Thomas>Thomas, Bob. ''Thalberg: Life and Legend'', New Millennium Press (1969)</ref>{{rp|39}}}}\n\nThalberg likewise gained the respect of noted playwrights, some of whom also looked down on him due to his young age. [[George S. Kaufman]], co-author of ''Dinner at Eight'', various Marx Brothers films, and two George Gershwin plays, came from New York to meet with Thalberg. Afterwards he confided to his friend, [[Groucho Marx]]: \"That man has never written a word, yet he can tell me exactly what to do with a story. I didn't know you had people like that out here.\"<ref name=Vieira />{{rp|189}}\n\nActress [[Norma Shearer]], whom he later married, was surprised after he greeted her at the door, then walked her to his office for her first job interview: \"Then you're not the office boy?\" she asked. He smiled, as he sat himself behind his desk: \"No, Miss Shearer, I'm Irving Thalberg, vice-president of the Mayer Company. I'm the man who sent for you.\"<ref name=Thomas />{{rp|44}}\n\nHis younger-than-normal age for a studio executive was usually mentioned even after he left Universal to help start up MGM. Screenwriter [[Agnes Christine Johnson]], who worked with Thalberg for years, described his contribution during meetings:\n\n{{quote|He's so marvelous that no one who doesn't know him can believe it. Seeing him sitting in with all the important people, looking such a boy, and deferred to by everybody, you'd think that either they were crazy or you were. But if you stayed and listened, you'd understand. He has a mind like a whip. Snap! He has an idea\u2014the right idea\u2014the only idea!<ref name=Vieira-1 />{{rp|73}}}}\n\nThe same quality was observed by director and screenwriter [[Hobart Henley]]: \"If something that read well in conference turns out not so good on the screen, I go to him and, like that\u2014Henley snaps his fingers\u2014he has a remedy. He's brilliant.\"<ref name=Vieira-1 />{{rp|74}} Another assistant producer to Thalberg explains:\n\n{{quote|Irving had a sixth sense about a manuscript. He was a film doctor. You could go out [to a preview] with a film, and if there was something that didn't quite come off, he could put his finger on it. Some of the great films that came out of Metro were ''re''made at his suggestion. He had that uncanny ability.<ref name=Vieira />{{rp|59\u201360}}}}\n\nHis youth also contributed to his open-mindedness to the ideas of others. [[Conrad Nagel]], who starred in numerous Thalberg films, notes that Thalberg was generally empathetic to those he worked alongside: \"Thalberg never raised his voice. He just looked into your eyes, spoke softly, and after a few minutes he cast a spell on you.\"<ref name=Vieira-1 />{{rp|74}} Studio attorney Edwin Loeb, who also worked to create AMPAS, explained that \"the real foundation of Irving's success was his ability to look at life through the eyes of any given person. He had a gift of [[empathy]], and almost complete perspective.\"<ref name=Vieira-1 />{{rp|74}} Those opinions were also shared by producer [[Walter Wanger]]: \"You thought that you were talking to an Indian savant. He could cast a spell on anybody.\"<ref name=Hoberman />\n\nHis talent as a producer was enhanced by his \"near-miraculous\" powers of concentration, notes film critic [[J. Hoberman]].<ref name=Hoberman /> As a result, he was never bored or tired, and supplemented his spare time with reading for his own amusement, recalls screenwriter [[Bayard Veiller]], with some of his favorite authors being [[Francis Bacon]], [[Epictetus]], and [[Immanuel Kant]].<ref name=Hoberman />\n\n==== Film projects at Universal ====\n[[File:Hunchback -Notre Dame 1923.jpg|thumb|Lon Chaney in ''The Hunchback of Notre Dame'' (1923)]]\nBiographer Bob Thomas writes that after three years at the studio, Thalberg continually proved his value. Universal's pictures improved noticeably, primarily due to Thalberg's \"uncanny sense of story.\" He took tight control over many key aspects of production, including his requirement that from then on scripts were tightly constructed before filming began, rather than during production. Thomas adds that he also \"showed a remarkable capacity for working with actors, casting them aptly and advising them on their careers.\"<ref name=Thomas />{{rp|37}}\n\nAfter producing two films that had already been started when he began work at Universal, he presented Laemmle with his idea for a film based on one of his favorite classic stories, ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]''. Rather than just a horror picture, Thalberg suggested turning it into a spectacle which would include a replica of the famous [[Notre Dame de Paris|Cathedral of Notre Dame]] in Paris. He had [[Lon Chaney, Sr.|Lon Chaney]] play the hunchback. The film became Universal's most profitable silent film and established Chaney's career as a top-flight star.<ref name=Thomas />{{rp|36}}\n\nAfter nearly three years with Universal, Thalberg had supervised over a hundred movies, reorganized the studio to give more control to the managers, and had \"stopped the defection\" of many of their leading stars by offering them better, higher-paying contracts. He also produced a number of Universal's prestige films, which made the company profitable. However, he decided it was time to find a studio in Los Angeles more suitable to his skills, and spread word that he was available.<ref name=Flamini />{{rp|43}}\n\n=== Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) ===\n[[File:With Mayer-Shearer.jpg|thumb|Thalberg (left) with wife, Norma Shearer, and Louis B. Mayer, 1932]]\n[[Cecil B. DeMille]] was the first who wanted to hire him, telling his partner, [[Jesse Lasky]], \"The boy is a genius. I can see it. I know it.\" Lasky opposed the hire, stating, \"Geniuses we have all we need.\"<ref name=Flamini />{{rp|46}} Thalberg then received an offer from [[Hal Roach]], but the offer was withdrawn because Thalberg lacked experience with [[slapstick comedy]] films. In late 1922, Thalberg was introduced to [[Louis B. Mayer]], president of a small, but dynamic and fast-growing studio. At that first meeting, Thalberg \"made a deep, immediate impression on Mayer,\" writes Flamini. After Thalberg had left, Mayer said to studio attorney Edwin Loeb: \"Tell him if he comes to work for me, I'll look after him as though he were my son.\"<ref name=Flamini />{{rp|46}}\n\nAlthough their personalities were in many ways opposite, Mayer being more outspoken and nearly twice the younger man's age, Thalberg was hired as vice president in charge of production at Louis B. Mayer Productions. Years later, Mayer's daughter, [[Irene Mayer Selznick]], recalled that \"it was hard to believe anyone that boyish could be so important.\"<ref name=Flamini />{{rp|47}} According to Flamini, Thalberg was hired because, although Mayer was an astute businessman, \"what he lacked was Thalberg's almost unerring ability to combine quality with commercial success, to bring artistic aspiration in line with the demands of the box office.\"<ref name=Flamini />{{rp|47}} Mayer's company subsequently merged with two others to become [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM), with the 24-year-old Thalberg made part-owner and accorded the same position as vice president in charge of production. Three years after the merger, MGM became the most successful studio in Hollywood.\n\nDuring his twelve years at MGM, Thalberg supervised the production of over four hundred films. Although Thalberg and his colleagues at MGM knew he was \"doomed\" to not live much past age 30 due to heart disease, he loved producing films. He continued developing innovative ideas and overseeing most of MGM's pictures. Under Thalberg's management, MGM released over 40% more films yearly than [[Warner Brothers]], and more than double [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]]'s releases. From 1924 until 1936, when Thalberg died at age 37, \"almost every film bore Thalberg's imprint,\" notes Mark Vieira.<ref name=Vieira>Vieira, Mark A. ''Hollywood Dreams Made Real: Irving Thalberg and the Rise of M-G-M'', Abrams, New York (2008)</ref>{{rp|7}}\n\n==== Production innovations ====\n[[File:Thalberg-Shearer-Grauman-32.jpg|thumb|[[Sid Grauman]], [[Norma Shearer]], and Thalberg, 1932]]\nThalberg's production techniques \"broke new ground in filmmaking,\" adds Vieira. Among his contributions at MGM was his innovation of story conferences, sneak previews and scene retakes. He introduced the first horror films and coauthored the [[Production Code]], the set of moral guidelines that all film studios agreed to follow. Thalberg helped synthesize and merge the world of stage drama and literary classics with Hollywood films.<ref name=Vieira />{{rp|7}}\n\nMGM thereby became the only movie studio to consistently show a profit during America's [[Great Depression]].<ref name=Flamini />{{rp|6}} Flamini explains that the equation for MGM's success depended on combining stars, a Broadway hit or popular classic, and high standards of production. This combination at the time was considered a \"revolutionary approach\" in the film industry, which until then assumed a star was all that was needed for success, regardless of the story or production quality. The other studios began following MGM's lead with that same formula.<ref name=Flamini />{{rp|6}}\n\n==== Production techniques ====\nThalberg generally followed a system in managing his productions. According to one of his assistants, [[Lawrence Weingarten]], who later became a producer, \"Thalberg directed the film on paper, and then the director directed the film on film.\"<ref name=Vieira />{{rp|59}}\n\nThalberg was generally opposed to location shooting in foreign countries where he could not oversee production and control costs, as happened with ''Ben Hur''. He therefore kept hundreds of back lot carpenters at work creating realistic sets, as he did for fifteenth-century [[Romeo and Juliet (1936 film)|''Romeo and Juliet'']] (1936), or with [[China Seas (film)|''China Seas'']] (1935), to replicate the harbors of Hong Kong.<ref name=Flamini />{{rp|9}}\n\nVieira points out that Thalberg's \"fascination with Broadway plays\" often had him create and present stories visually.<ref name=Vieira-1 />{{rp|8}} For ''China Seas'', for instance, he described for the screenwriters, director and others, exactly how he wanted the film to appear on screen:\n\n{{quote|I'd like to open this sequence on a roaring gale at sea. ... I think it might be better to open just prior to the storm\u2014that awful calm before the storm ... and the typhoon hits and they go through all that hell, and the terrific tiredness after the fight is over\u2014the weariness of Gaskell [Clark Gable], and from behind him this China woman comes and their affair [begins].}}\n\nTo be certain of achieving the desired effects, Thalberg made sure his [[cinematographer]]s were careful in their use of light and shadow. Vieira observes that \"more than any other producer or any other studio, Thalberg and MGM manipulated lenses, filters, and lighting instruments to affect the viewer.\" As a result, he notes, \"most of Thalberg's films contain moments such as these, in which cinematic technique transcends mere exposition and gives the viewer something to treasure.\"<ref name=Vieira-1 />{{rp|8\u20139}}\n\nThalberg was supported by most of the studio in these kinds of creative decisions. \"It was a big family,\" notes Weingarten. \"If we had a success, everybody\u2014and I mean every cutter, every painter, every plasterer\u2014was excited about it, was abuzz, was in a tizzy about the whole idea of picture making.\"<ref name=Vieira />{{rp|59}}\n\n==== Taking risks with new subjects and stars ====\n{{quote box|align=right|width=25em|bgcolor = MistyRose|quote=A temperate man in all his ways of living, in this one respect he was an inveterate gambler. If he believed in a man, or a project, or a story, he would stake everything on his conviction. ... Everyone who worked for Thalberg loved him. He had the quality, rare among showmen, and precious among men, of standing back after an achievement and letting the other fellow take the credit ... he never wanted to be known as the big promoter. He just saw a little farther than most of the others, and trusted his vision, and worked like a laborer until it came true. ... What he also had was a great kindliness, a love for his work, workers, friends and audiences.|source= \u2014[[C. A. Lejeune]], film critic of the London ''Observer''<ref name=Thomas />{{rp|295}}}}\n\nIn 1929, MGM released fifty films, and all but five showed a profit. Of those that failed, ''[[Hallelujah (film)|Hallelujah]]'' in 1929 was also a gamble by Thalberg. When [[King Vidor]], the film's producer and director, proposed the idea to Thalberg of a major film cast, for the first time, exclusively with African Americans, he told Thalberg directly, \"I doubt that it will make a dollar at the box office.\" Thalberg replied, \"Don't worry about that. I've told you that MGM can afford an occasional experiment.\"<ref name=Vieira-1 />{{rp|105}}\n\nBy the early 1930s, a number of stars began failing at the box office, partly due to the Great Depression that was now undermining the economy, along with the public's ability to spend on entertainment. Thalberg began using two stars in a film, rather than one, as had been the tradition at all the studios, such as pairing [[Greta Garbo]] with [[John Gilbert (actor)|John Gilbert]], [[Clark Gable]] with [[Jean Harlow]], and [[William Powell]] with [[Myrna Loy]]. After experimenting with a few such films, including ''[[Mata Hari (1931 film)|Mata Hari]]'' in 1931, which were profitable, he decided on a multi-star production of another Broadway play, ''[[Grand Hotel (1932 film)|Grand Hotel]]'', later that same year. It had five major stars, including Garbo, [[Joan Crawford]], [[John Barrymore]], [[Lionel Barrymore]], and [[Wallace Beery]].<ref name=Flamini />{{rp|6}} \"Before Thalberg,\" writes Vieira, \"there was no ''Grand Hotel'' in the American consciousness.\"<ref name=Vieira-1 />{{rp|7}} The film won the Oscar for Best Picture in 1932.<ref name=Vieira-1 />{{rp|167}}\n\nThalberg went against consensus and took another risk with ''[[The Great Ziegfeld]]'' (1936), costarring [[Luise Rainer]]. Although Louis B. Mayer did not want her in the role, which he felt was too minor for a new star, Thalberg felt that \"only she could play the part\", notes biographer Charles Higham.<ref name=\"Higham\">Higham, Charles. ''Merchant of Dreams: Louis B. Mayer, M.G.M., and the Secret Hollywood'', Donald I. Fine, Inc. (1993)</ref>{{rp|240}} Shortly after shooting began in late 1935, doubts of Rainer's acting ability emerged in the press.<ref name=\"eyes\">\"Tantalizing Eyes Chief Appeal of Beautiful Luise Rainer\" by Dan Thomas, ''[[Pittsburgh Press]]'', October 28, 1935, p. 14</ref> However, despite her limited appearances in the film, Rainer \"so impressed audiences with one highly emotional scene\" that she won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]].<ref name=Affron>Affron, Charles, and Edelman, Rob. ''International Dictionary of Films and Filmmakers,'' St. James Press (1997) pp. 997\u2013999</ref>\n\nAfter her winning role in ''The Great Ziegfeld'', Thalberg wanted her to play a role that was the opposite of her previous character, for ''[[The Good Earth (film)|The Good Earth]]'' (1937). For the part as a Chinese peasant, she was required to act totally subservient to her husband, being perpetually huddled in submission, and barely spoke a word of dialogue during the entire film. Rainer recalls that Mayer did not approve of the film being produced or her part in it: \"He was horrified at Irving Thalberg's insistence for me to play O-lan, the poor uncomely little Chinese peasant.\"<ref name=Verswijver />{{rp|142}} However, she again won the Oscar for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]], becoming the first actress to win two consecutive Oscars, a feat not matched until [[Katharine Hepburn]]'s two Oscar wins thirty years later.<ref name=\"Affron\" />\n\n==== Grooming new stars ====\nBesides bringing a distinctive high quality \"look\" to MGM films and often recreating well-known stories or plays, Thalberg's actors themselves took on a characteristic quality. Thalberg wanted his female actors to appear \"cool, classy and beautiful,\" notes Flamini. And he strove to make the male actors appear \"worldly and in control.\" In general, Thalberg movies and actors came to be \"luxurious,\" \"glossy,\" and \"technically flawless.\"<ref name=Flamini />{{rp|8}} By doing so, he made stars of actors such as [[Lon Chaney]], [[Ramon Novarro]], [[John Gilbert (actor)|John Gilbert]], [[Greta Garbo]], [[Joan Crawford]], [[Clark Gable]], [[Helen Hayes]], [[Jean Harlow]], [[Marie Dressler]], [[Wallace Beery]], [[John Barrymore]], [[Lionel Barrymore]] and [[Luise Rainer]].<ref name=Vieira-1 />{{rp|7}}\n\n;Luise Rainer\n[[Luise Rainer]], under his guidance, became the first star to win two consecutive Academy Awards as Best Actress. After Thalberg's sudden death during production of [[The Good Earth (film)|''The Good Earth'']] (1937), her film career went into decline from being given a string of bad parts, and she gave up her film career. Rainer commented years later, \"His dying was a terrible shock to us. He was young and ever so able. Had it not been that he died, I think I may have stayed much longer in films.\"<ref name=Verswijver>Verswijver, Leo. ''Movies Were Always Magical'', McFarland Publ. (2003) p. 142</ref>\n\n;Greta Garbo\nIn 1925, a young [[Greta Garbo]], then twenty, and unable to speak any English, was brought over from Sweden at Mayer's request, as he saw how she looked in still photos. A Swedish friend thought he would help her by contacting Thalberg, who then agreed to give her a screen test. According to author Frederick Sands, \"the result of the test was electrifying.\" Thalberg was impressed and began grooming the new starlet the following day: \"the studio arranged to fix her teeth, made sure she lost weight, and gave her an English tutor.\"<ref name=Sands>Sands, Frederick. ''The Divine Garbo'', Grosset & Dunlap (1979) pp. 69\u201373</ref>\n;Joan Crawford\n[[Joan Crawford]]'s first role was a Thalberg production at MGM and she became one of their leading stars for the next thirty years. She felt that his contribution to MGM was vital to the film industry. Not long after his early death, she recalls her concerns: \"Thalberg was dead and the concept of the quality 'big' picture pretty much went out the window.\"<ref>Leider, Emily W. ''Myrna Loy: The Only Good Girl in Hollywood'', Univ. of California Press (2011) p. 184</ref>\n\n;Marie Dressler\nThalberg also realized that old stars few had heard of could be made into new ones. [[Marie Dressler]], a fifty-nine-year-old early [[vaudeville]] star, was unable to get any roles in films. MGM screenwriter Frances Marion suggested to Thalberg that she might fit well in a starring role for a new film, and was surprised when he knew of her prior successes. Thalberg approved of using her without a screen test and offered his rationale:\n\n{{quote|My theory is that anybody who once hits the bull's-eye\u2014it doesn't matter in what profession\u2014has the brains and stamina to stage a comeback. So I figure that a woman who held the spotlight for so many years has been the victim of bad writing\u2014and probably a lot of bad advice.<ref name=Vieira-1 />{{rp|72}}}}\n\nBy 1932, shortly before she died, Dressler was the country's number one box office star.\n\n==== Getting audience feedback and reshooting ====\nAccording to Vieira, MGM had few failures during this period, and numerous blockbusters. Among the reasons was Thalberg's unique system of developing a script during story conferences with writers before filming began, and later giving \"sneak previews\" followed by audience feedback through written questionnaires. Often, where he felt improvement was needed, he arranged for scenes to be reshot. As Thalberg once stated, \"The difference between something good and something superior is often very small.\"<ref name=Vieira-1 />{{rp|50}}\n\n==== Bad decisions and missed opportunities ====\nThalberg felt he had his \"finger on the pulse of America. I know what people will do and what they won't do,\" he said.<ref name=\"friedrich1997\">{{cite book | title=City of Nets: A Portrait of Hollywood in 1940s | publisher=University of California Press | author=Friedrich, Otto | year=1997 | edition=reprint | location=Berkeley and Los Angeles | pages=[https://archive.org/details/cityofnetsportra00frie/page/16 16\u201317] | isbn=0-520-20949-4 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/cityofnetsportra00frie/page/16 }}</ref> His judgment was not always accurate, however. Thalberg's bringing Broadway productions to the screen to develop higher picture standards sometimes resulted in \"studied\" acting or \"stagey\" sets, notes Flamini.<ref name=Flamini />{{rp|6}} In 1927, after the successful release of the first full-length talking picture, ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'' (1927), he nevertheless felt that talking pictures were a fad. Thalberg likewise did not think that color would replace black-and-white in movies.<ref name=Vieira-1 />{{rp|71}}\n\nWhen an assistant protested against a script that envisioned a love scene in Paris with an ocean background, Thalberg refused to make changes, saying \"We can't cater to a handful of people who know Paris.\"{{r|friedrich1997}} A more serious distraction to Thalberg's efforts was his obsession with making his wife [[Norma Shearer]] a prominent star, efforts which sometimes led to \"overblown and overglamous\" productions.<ref name=Flamini />{{rp|7}} Thalberg himself admitted to his obsession years later when he told a fellow producer: \"You're behaving like I did with Norma. I knew positively that she could play anything. It's a kind of romantic astigmatism that attacks producers when they fall for an actress.\"<ref name=Vieira-1 />{{rp|201}}\n\n==== Important films at MGM ====\n===== ''Ben Hur'' (1925) =====\n[[File:Ben Hur race.jpg|thumb|Scene from ''Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ'' (1925)]]\nOne of the first pictures he took charge of, ''[[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ (1925 film)|Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ]]'', was inherited and already in production by another studio when MGM was formed. The film was turning into a disastrous expense with cost overruns already in the millions due to its lavish sets and location shooting in Rome. Most studio executives chose to terminate the film to cut their losses. Thalberg, however, felt differently, and thought the film would affect movie audiences, due to its classic literary source, and would highlight MGM as a major new studio.\n\nHe, therefore, discarded much of the original footage shot in Italy and recreated the set on MGM's back lots in Culver City, which added more millions to the production, yet gave him more control over production. The new set also included a replica of [[Circus Maximus]] for the dramatic chariot race scenes. Flamini notes that Thalberg's \"gamble paid off,\" drawing international attention to MGM, and to Thalberg within the movie industry for his bold action.<ref name=Flamini />{{rp|5}}\n\n===== ''Mutiny on the Bounty'' (1935) =====\n[[Mutiny on the Bounty (1935 film)|''Mutiny on the Bounty'']] was the studio's next most expensive film after ''Ben Hur'', with some now calling it \"Thalberg's masterpiece.\"<ref name=examiner>Wiebe, Charles. \"Mutiny on the Bounty: Irving Thalberg's Masterpiece\", ''Examiner.com, May 11, 2016</ref> He initially had difficulty convincing Mayer that he could make the film without making heroes of the mutineers. He achieved that by instead making a hero of the British Royal Navy, whereby the officers and shipmates would from then on display their mutual respect. Thalberg also had to convince Clark Gable to accept the role against his will. He pleaded with Gable, eventually promising him that \"If it isn't one of your greatest successes, I'll never ask you again to play a part you don't want.\"<ref name=examiner /> The film's other main stars were [[Charles Laughton]] and [[Franchot Tone]]. The film was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Actor, and winning it for Best Picture. Thalberg accepted the award as producer from [[Frank Capra]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUcBWCprqKI \"''Mutiny on the Bounty'' wins the 1935 Academy Award for Best Picture\"]</ref>\n\n==== Thalberg and Mayer partnership ====\nAt first, Thalberg and studio chief [[Louis B. Mayer]] got along splendidly; however, they had different production philosophies. Thalberg preferred literary works, while Mayer preferred glitzy crowd-pleasing films. A clash was inevitable, and their relationship grew decidedly frosty. When Thalberg fell ill in the final weeks of 1932, Mayer took advantage of the situation and replaced him with [[David O. Selznick]] and [[Walter Wanger]]. Thalberg's reputation by that time for working long hours was widely known, and rumors about the related strain on his fragile health had become front-page news in entertainment trade publications. ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' in January 1933 updated its readership about his condition and addressed growing concerns that he might be forced, despite his young age, to quit the business:\n\n{{quote|In an effort to quiet rumors zooming throughout the industry, indicating that Irving Thalberg would be compelled to retire permanently as production head of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and take a long rest, a reporter from this publication got in touch with his physician yesterday for a statement as to the real condition of Mr. Thalberg. Dr. Philip Newmark stated:\n\n<blockquote>Mr. Thalberg had a heavy attack of [[influenza]] that lasted several days and, although he was quite ill, he recovered nicely. However, he is far from being in good condition, he is all tired out and needs rest. I want him to take a rest for several weeks. I do not consider it necessary, at this time, to send him away, as he is quite comfortable at home.</blockquote>\n\nAsked about the report that Thalberg had suffered a violent heart attack, Dr. Newmark replied: \"Mr. Thalberg's heart has not been any too strong and that is another reason why I have insisted that he take a long rest.<ref>[http://archive.org/stream/hollywoodreporte1215wilk#page/n13/mode/2up \"'Thalberg Needs Rest,' Declares His Physician\"], ''The Hollywood Reporter'' (Los Angeles, California), January 5, 1933, pages 1-2. [[Internet Archive]], San Francisco, California. Retrieved August 20, 2018.</ref>}}\n\nOnce Thalberg recovered sufficiently from his bout with the \"flu\" and was able to return to work later in 1933, it was as one of MGM's unit producers, albeit one who had first choice on projects as well as preferential access to all the studio's resources, most notably its stars. Thalberg's close relationship to [[Nicholas Schenck]], then president of [[Loew's Incorporated]], proved to be an ongoing advantage for him. Loew's was the corporate parent of MGM, so Schenck was the true power and ultimate arbiter at the studio; and he usually supported Thalberg's decisions and continued to do so whenever disagreements about projects or production needs arose. As a result, Thalberg also continued to produce or coproduce some of MGM's most prestigious and critically acclaimed ventures in this period, such as ''[[The Barretts of Wimpole Street (1934 film)|The Barretts of Wimpole Street]]'' starring his wife [[Norma Shearer]] (1934), ''[[Mutiny on the Bounty (1935 film)|Mutiny on the Bounty]]'' (1935), ''[[China Seas (film)|China Seas]]'' (1935), ''[[A Night at the Opera (film)|A Night at the Opera]]'' (1935), ''[[San Francisco (1936 film)|San Francisco]]'' (1936), and ''[[Romeo and Juliet (1936 film)|Romeo and Juliet]]'' (1936).\n\n== Personal life ==\nDuring his few years with Universal while living in New York, Thalberg had become romantically involved with Carl Laemmle's daughter, Rosabelle. Still in his early twenties and later spending most of his time in Los Angeles, his feelings toward her were no longer as strong. Flamini suspects that this may have affected his position at Universal and partly caused his decision to leave the company. \" The Laemmles prayed that Irving would marry Rosabelle,\" notes Flamini. \"They wanted their sons to be educated and their daughters to marry nice Jewish boys.\"<ref name=Flamini />{{rp|45}}\n\n[[File:Thalberg-Shearer.jpg|left|thumb|With wife actress [[Norma Shearer]], July 1936]]\nLess than a year after he and Mayer took charge of the newly created MGM studios, and still only twenty-five years old, Thalberg suffered a serious heart attack due to overwork. Mayer also became aware of Thalberg's congenital heart problems and now worried about the prospect of running MGM without him. Mayer also became concerned that one of his daughters might become romantically involved, and told them so:\n\n{{quote|He's attractive. I don't want you girls getting any ideas in your heads, ever. ... I don't want to have a young widow on my hands.<ref name=Flamini />{{rp|49}}}}\n\nThalberg, aware of Mayer's feelings, made it a point of never giving too much attention to his daughters at social events.\n\nOne of Thalberg's traits was his ability to work long hours into the night with little sign of fatigue. According to Vieira, Thalberg believed that as long as his mind was active in his work and he was not bored, he would not feel tired. Thalberg, who often got by with only five hours of sleep, felt that most people could get by with less than they realized.<ref name=Vieira-1 />{{rp|74}} To keep his mental faculties at peak, he would read philosophical books by Bacon, Epictetus, or Kant. \"They stimulate me. I'd drop out of sight in no time if I didn't read and keep up with current thought\u2014and the philosophers are brain sharpeners.\"\n\nDuring the early 1930s, Thalberg was ambivalent about political events in Europe. While he feared Nazism and the rise of Hitler, he also feared Communism. At the time, notes Vieira, \"given a choice between communism and fascism, many Americans\u2014including Thalberg\u2014would prefer the latter.\"<ref name=Vieira-1 />{{rp|309}} Thalberg stated his opinion:\n\n{{quote|When a dictator dies, his system dies, too. But if communism is allowed to spread, it will be harder to root out. What is at stake is our whole way of life, our freedom. They will have vanished forever.<ref name=Vieira-1 />{{rp|309}}}}\n\nWhen others suggested that many Jews could die in Germany as a result of Nazi anti-Semitism, he replied that in his opinion \"Hitler and Hitlerism will pass.\" On one occasion, Catholic [[Hubertus, Prince of L\u00f6wenstein-Wertheim-Freudenberg|Prince Lowenstein]] of Germany, who himself had almost been captured before fleeing Germany, told him: \"Mr. Thalberg, your own people are being systematically hunted down and rooted out of Germany.\" Thalberg suggested that world Jewry should nevertheless not interfere, that the Jewish race would survive Hitler.<ref name=Flamini />{{rp|181}}<ref name=Vieira-1 />{{rp|310}} Within a few years.

She went on to be one of MGM's biggest stars of the 1930s. Their two children were [[Irving Thalberg, Jr.|Irving Jr.]] (1930\u20131987) and Katherine (1935\u20132006).<ref>Schatz, Thomas (1988).

A few weeks earlier, Thalberg's leading screenwriter, Al Lewin, had proposed doing a film based on a soon-to-be published book, ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone with the Wind]]''. Although Thalberg said it would be a \"sensational\" role for Gable, and a \"terrific picture,\" he decided not to do it:\n\n{{quote|Look, I have just made ''Mutiny on the Bounty'' and ''The Good Earth''. And now you're asking me to burn Atlanta? No! Absolutely not! No more epics for me now. Just give me a little drawing-room drama. I'm tired.

His condition worsened steadily and he eventually required an oxygen tent at home. He died on September 14, at the age of 37.<ref name=obit>{{cite news |title=I. G. Thalberg Dies, Film Producer, 37.

The funeral attracted thousands of spectators who came to view the arrival of countless stars from MGM and other studios, including [[Greta Garbo]], [[Jean Harlow]], the [[Marx Brothers]], [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Walt Disney]], [[Howard Hughes]], [[Al Jolson]], [[Gary Cooper]], [[Carole Lombard]], [[Mary Pickford]], and [[Douglas Fairbanks]], among the stars. The ushers who led them to their seats included [[Clark Gable]], [[Fredric March]], and playwright [[Moss Hart]]. [[Erich von Stroheim]], who had been fired by Thalberg, came to pay his respects. Producers Louis B. Mayer, the Warner Brothers, Adolph Zukor and Nicholas Schenck sat together solemnly as Rabbi Magnin gave the eulogy.<ref name=Flamini />{{rp|272}}<ref name=Thomas />{{rp|297}}\n\nThalberg is buried in a private marble tomb in the Great Mausoleum at [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale|Forest Lawn Memorial Park]] in [[Glendale, California]], lying at rest beside his wife Norma Shearer Arrouge (Thalberg's crypt was engraved \"My Sweetheart Forever\" by Shearer).\n\nOver the following days, tributes were published by the national press. [[Louis B. Mayer]], his co-founding partner at [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], said he had lost \"the finest friend a man could ever have,\" while MGM president [[Nicholas Schenck]] stated that \"Thalberg was the most important man in the production end of the motion-picture industry.<ref name=Flamini />{{rp|273}} Leading producers from the other studios also expressed their feelings in published tributes to Thalberg:<ref name=obit />\n\n[[David O. Selznick]] described him as \"beyond any question the greatest individual force for fine pictures.\" [[Samuel Goldwyn]] called him \"the foremost figure in the motion-picture industry ... and an inspiration. ... \" M. H. Aylesworth, Chairman of RKO, wrote that \"his integrity, vision and ability made him the spearhead of all motion-picture production throughout the world.\" [[Harry Warner]], president of Warner Brothers, described him as \"gifted with one of the finest minds ever placed at the service of motion-picture production.\" Sidney R. Kent, president of Twentieth Century Fox, said that \"he made the whole world richer by giving it the highest type of entertainment. He was a true genius.\" Columbia president [[Harry Cohn]] said the \"motion picture industry has suffered a loss from which it will not soon recover...\". [[Darryl F. Zanuck]] noted, \"More than any other man he raised the industry to its present world prestige.\" [[Adolph Zukor]], chairman of Paramount, stated, \"Irving Thalberg was the most brilliant young man in the motion picture business.\" [[Jesse Lasky]] said, \"It will be utterly impossible to replace him.\"<ref name=obit /><ref name=Thomas />{{rp|294}}\n\nAmong the condolences that came from world political leaders, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] wrote, \"The world of art is poorer with the passing of Irving Thalberg. His high ideals, insight and imagination went into the production of his masterpieces.\"<ref name=Thomas />{{rp|297}}\n\nAmong the pictures that were unfinished or not yet released at the time of his death were ''A Day at the Races,'' ''The Good Earth,'' ''Camille'', ''Maytime'' and ''Romeo and Juliet.'' Groucho Marx, star of ''A Day at the Races'', wrote, \"After Thalberg's death, my interest in the movies waned. I continued to appear in them, but ... The fun had gone out of picture making.\"<ref name=Vieira-1 />{{rp|379}} Thalberg's widow, Norma Shearer, recalled, \"Grief does very strange things to you.

He notes that with his numerous production innovations and grand stories, often turning classic literature and Broadway stage productions into big-screen pictures, he managed to keep \"American movies supreme throughout the world for a generation.\" [[Darryl F. Zanuck]], founder of [[20th Century Fox]], said that during Thalberg's brief career, he had become the \"most creative producer in the history of films.\"<ref name=Thomas />{{rp|299}} Thomas describes some of his contributions:\n\n{{quote|The touchstone of his genius was quality, the unceasing pursuit of quality. He ventured into uncharted land in his search for improved film entertainment, and his attainments became the goals of his competitors. He was ever seeking refinement in visual images, in sound and music, in acting style and directorial technique. Most of all, in writing. ... He recognized when words sang, when characters lost their cardboard effect and acquired dimension, when events could be so devised to stir the emotions and raise the spirit. Thalberg's films performed those feats to an amazing degree, and no filmmaker has since achieved his measure.<ref name=Thomas />{{rp|299}}}}\n\nMost of MGM's major films in the 1930s were, according to Flamini, \"in a very real sense,\" made by Thalberg. He closely supervised the making of \"more pictures than any other producer in Hollywood's history,\" and was considered the \"archetype of the creative producer,\" adds Flamini. Upon his early death at age 37, a ''New York Times'' editorial called him \"the most important force\" in the motion picture industry. The paper added that for the film industry, he \"set the pace and others followed ... because his way combined style, glamour, and profit.\" He is described by Flamini as having been \"a revolutionary in a gray flannel suit.\"<ref name=Flamini />{{rp|4}}\n\nThalberg refused to take credit as producer, and as a result his name never appeared on the screen while he was alive. Thalberg claimed that \"credit you give yourself is not worth having\". His final film, released after he died, was ''[[The Good Earth (film)|The Good Earth]]'' (1937), which won numerous Academy Awards. Its opening screen credit was dedicated to Thalberg:\n\n{{quote|To the Memory of Irving Grant Thalberg&nbsp;\u2013 we dedicate this picture&nbsp;\u2013 his last great achievement.<ref name=Thomas />{{rp|298}}}}\n\nIn 1938, the new multimillion-dollar MGM administration building in [[Culver City, California|Culver City]] was named for Thalberg. The [[Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award]], presented by the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]], also named for him, awards producers for consistently high production achievements.<ref name=Hoberman>[http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/197790/irving-thalberg-award \"Hollywood's Ultimate Honor Isn't the Oscar. It's the Irving.\"], ''Tablet Magazine'', Feb. 24, 2016</ref>\n\n== Cultural legacy ==\n=== ''The Last Tycoon'' ===\nIn October 1939, American novelist [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] began writing ''[[The Last Tycoon]]'', a fictionalized biography of Thalberg, naming the protagonist Monroe Stahr to represent Thalberg. \"Thalberg has always fascinated me,\" he wrote to an editor. \"His peculiar charm, his extraordinary good looks, his bountiful success, the tragic end of his great adventure. The events I have built around him are fiction, but all of them are things which might very well have happened. ... I've long chosen him for a hero (this has been in my mind for three years) because he is one of the half-dozen men I have known who were built on a grand scale.\"<ref name=Thomas />{{rp|8}}\n\nThomas notes that among the reasons Fitzgerald chose to write a book about a Thalberg-like character, was that \"throughout his literary career, Fitzgerald borrowed his heroes from friends he admired, and inevitably a bit of Fitzgerald entered the characterizations.\" Fitzgerald himself writes that \"When I like men, I want to be like them ...\" Fitzgerald and Thalberg had real life similarities: both were prodigies, each had heart ailments, and they both died at early ages.<ref name=Thomas />{{rp|8}}\n\nAccording to biographer [[Matthew J. Bruccoli]], Fitzgerald believed that Thalberg, with his \"taste and courage, represented the best of Hollywood. ... [and] saw Thalberg as a model for what could be done in the movies.\"<ref name=Bruccoli /> Fitzgerald died before the novel was completed, however. Bruccoli writes of Fitzgerald's book:\n\n{{quote|Nurturing a heroic sense of American character, he found his essential American figure in his last novel. ... So thorough was Fitzgerald's identification with his hero that Stahr stands among the most compelling Jewish characters in American fiction.<ref name=Bruccoli />}}\n\nAlthough parallels between Monroe Stahr in the novel and Thalberg were evident, many who knew Thalberg intimately stated that they did not see similarities in their personalities.<ref name=Thomas />{{rp|13}} Norma Shearer said that the Stahr character was not at all like her former husband.<ref name=Bruccoli>Bruccoli, Matthew J. ''Some Sort of Epic Grandeur: The Life of F. Scott Fitzgerald'', Harcourt Brace Jovanovich (1981) pp. 466\u2013468</ref>\n\nIn the 1976 [[The Last Tycoon (1976 film)|film version]], directed by [[Elia Kazan]], Monroe Stahr was played by [[Robert De Niro]]. Kazan, in his pre-production notes, described the Stahr character as he saw him:\n\n{{quote|Stahr is special, unique, monastic, a relic. He walks alone. Occasionally men follow him waiting for orders. He is in a daze of work and thought. He carries the whole studio operation in his head.<ref>Kazan, Elia. ''Kazan on Directing'', Random House (2009) p. 229</ref>}}\n\nIn the [[The Last Tycoon (TV series)|2016 television series]] based on the novel, Monroe Stahr is played by [[Matt Bomer]].\n\n=== Others ===\nFitzgerald also based his short story \"[[Crazy Sunday]],\" originally published in the October 1932 issue of ''[[American Mercury]]'', on an incident he witnessed at a party thrown by Thalberg and Shearer. The story is included in Fitzgerald's collection ''[[Taps at Reveille]]'' (1935).\n\nThalberg was portrayed in the movie ''[[Man of a Thousand Faces (film)|Man of a Thousand Faces]]'' (1957) by [[Robert Evans]], who appropriately enough went on to become a studio head himself.\n\nThalberg was portrayed by Bill Cusack in ''Young Indiana Jones and the Hollywood Follies'' (1994), a TV film based on ''[[The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles]]'', in which [[Indiana Jones]] is depicted as taking part in Thalberg's conflict with Erich von Stroheim over ''Foolish Wives''.\n\n== Filmography
