It is named after the [[Money in the Bank ladder match]], which previously only took place at WrestleMania. The Money in the Bank ladder match debuted at [[WrestleMania 21]] in 2005. The Money in the Bank match would then be held at the next five WrestleMania events, after which the match concept was spun off on to its own pay-per-view beginning in 2010.\n\n==Concept==\nThe \"Money in the Bank\" pay-per-view centers around a [[Money in the Bank ladder match|ladder match]], the prize of which is a briefcase containing a contract for a championship match. The winner can then cash in the contract at a time and place of their choosing anytime within the next year \u2013 beginning the night they win the briefcase \u2013 for a world championship match. If the contract is not used within that year, it is voided, but this has yet to happen.\n\nIn [[Money in the Bank (2010)|2010]] and [[Money in the Bank (2011)|2011]], the annual pay-per-views included two Money in the Bank ladder matches. One ladder match was for the [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] [[WWE brand extension|brand]] with a contract for a [[WWE Championship]] match, while the other ladder match was for the [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]] brand with a contract for a [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]] match. The brand split ended in August 2011, after which, the Money in the Bank pay-per-views continued to have two ladder matches for contracts for the respective titles, but they were not brand exclusive. After the two titles were unified in December 2013, a championship match contract for the unified [[WWE Championship|WWE World Heavyweight Championship]] became the prize of a single Money in the Bank ladder match. The brand split returned after the [[Money in the Bank (2016)|2016 event]], but the [[Money in the Bank (2017)|2017 pay-per-view]] was SmackDown-exclusive. The championship match contract in the ladder match was for SmackDown's WWE Championship (formerly WWE World Heavyweight Championship). The 2017 event also featured the first-ever women's Money in the Bank ladder match with its contract being for a [[WWE SmackDown Women's Championship|SmackDown Women's Championship]] match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://moneyinthebank2017.com/|title=money in the bank 2017|website=moneyinthebank2017.com}}</ref>\n\nThe event became dual branded beginning with the [[Money in the Bank (2018)|2018 pay-per-view]], involving both the Raw and SmackDown brands. There are now two Money in the Bank ladder matches, one for men and one for women, each having eight participants evenly divided between the brands. The contract in each grants the winner a championship match for their respective brand's world championship: the [[WWE Universal Championship|Universal Championship]] or WWE Championship, and the [[WWE Raw Women's Championship|Raw Women's Championship]] or SmackDown Women's Championship. In [[Money in the Bank (2019)|2019]] though, the winner of each match could choose the championship to challenge for.<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Burdick|first1=Michael|title=Men\u2019s Money in the Bank Ladder Match|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/moneyinthebank/2018/mens-money-in-the-bank-ladder-match|publisher=WWE|accessdate=May 24, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last1=Burdick|first1=Michael|title=Women\u2019s Money in the Bank Ladder Match|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/moneyinthebank/2018/womens-money-in-the-bank-ladder-match|publisher=WWE|accessdate=May 24, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Theme song==\nMoney in the Bank is the only WWE pay-per-view event with a regular theme song, as all but the first event have used \"Money in the Bank\" by in-house WWE composer [[Jim Johnston (composer)|Jim Johnston]] as its theme song.<ref name=iTunes_MITB>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/wwe-money-in-the-bank-official/id445874610|title=Money in the Bank|date=2011-06-22|publisher=[[iTunes]]|accessdate=2011-06-23}}</ref> This is in stark contrast to other pay-per-view events, which use songs sponsored by mainstream recording artists, which was the case with the first event using \"[[Cool Is Just a Number|Money]]\" by [[I Fight Dragons]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/content/media/video/vms/moneyinthebank/2010/june15-21/14780644|title=Money in the Bank: \"Money\" by I Fight Dragons is the official theme song for Money in the Bank|date=2010-06-17|accessdate=2010-06-19|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]}}</ref> Before the advent of the pay-per-view, the \"Money in the Bank\" song was used as the entrance music for [[Donald Trump]] for his numerous guest appearances on WWE television.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://watchwrestling.cc/wwe/ppv/ |title=Money in the Bank: \"Money\" by I Fight Dragons is the official theme song for Money in the Bank|date=2010-06-17|accessdate=2010-06-19|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]}}</ref>\n\n==Dates and venues==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 0 auto\"\n|style=\"background:#BBF;

The city is also noted for the first bloodshed of the American Revolution in the [[Gasp\u00e9e Affair|''Gasp\u00e9e'' Affair]].

Produced by Shri Narotam Ji Productions, the film stars [[Ammy Virk]] and [[Sargun Mehta]] with [[Guggu Gill]], [[Tania (Indian actress)|Tania]] and Harby Sangha in supporting roles. It was titled after a 2017 song of the same name, sung by Virk and starring Mehta in its music video. The film follows a man who falls in love whilst studying in [[Chandigarh]], despite his marriage being arranged to another woman. It marked feature film debut for Tania.\n\n[[Principal photography]] took place within a single schedule that lasted 45 days in Chandigarh and other villages of [[Punjab, India]], with Jalesh Oberoi serving as cinematographer. The background score was composed by Gurmeet Singh and Sandeep Saxena while the soundtrack was composed by [[B Praak]] and [[Sukh-E]], with vocals from Ammy Virk, [[Gurnam Bhullar]], [[Kamal Khan (singer)|Kamal Khan]], Divya Bhatt, Neetu Bhalla and B Praak. Also, Khan won \"Best Playback Singer\" Award.\n\n''Qismat'' was released worldwide on 21 September 2018 by [[White Hill Studios]].  The film attracted positive reviews from critics, with some highlighting it as Virk's best performance at the time, while some criticized film's length. Commercially, the film is blockbuster and had grossed {{INRConvert|310.5|m}} in its theatrical run, and it ran for more than 50 days. Also, the film is one of the [[List of highest-grossing Punjabi films|highest-grossing Punjabi films]] of all time and [[List of Punjabi films of 2018#Box office|second highest grossing Punjabi film of 2018]]. The film won Best Film (critics) award at [[PTC Punjabi Film Awards 2019|9th PTC Punjabi Film Awards]], and was nominated for Best Film award at PTC Awards and Brit Asia Film Awards.\n\nSidhu announced the sequel of the film and was confirmed later by him in May 2019. Sidhu, Virk, Mehta, Jaani, and B Praak are expected to return for the sequel.\n\nThe Youtube video for the title song<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xVp8m0fJSg|title=Qismat (Full Video) {{!}} Ammy Virk {{!}} Sargun Mehta {{!}} Jaani {{!}} B Praak {{!}} Arvindr Khaira {{!}} Punjabi Songs|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> starts with a red bus named \"Corona\". This was the highlighted topic in the comments section of the video.\n\n== Plot ==\n\nThe film begins when the main actor, Shivjit, asks his parents to send him off [[Chandigarh]] to go to college. He had already failed twice in obtaining his bachelor's degree. So Shivjit decides to make a pact with his parents that if he moves to the city, he will pass his exams. Shivjit's father is reluctant in sending his son to college and introduces the idea of marrying him off. However, his mother agrees to Shivjit's plan and lets him move to the city. Once he reaches Chandigarh, he immediately begins his search for a casual relationship. He quickly encounters Bani who had caught his attention in front of his new apartment building.\n\nBani is a beautiful young woman who is already in a relationship. Bani goes to visit her boyfriend in his apartment with food. She looks into her boyfriend bedroom and realizes that her boyfriend's cheating on her with a random woman in his bed. To make her ex-boyfriend jealous and teach him a lesson, Bani asks for Shivjit's help in posing as her fake boyfriend. As they continue their fake relationship, Shivjit and Bani start getting close and a start developing feelings for one another.\n\nHeartbroken and ashamed from her past relationship experiences Bani suggests to her father that she will get an arranged marriage to whomever he prefers. This doesn't sit well with Shivjit, and he sends a letter to Bani. He writes that she should marry someone she prefers and not a random stranger that her father picked. However, the letter ends up in her father's hands, who is an [[Station house officer|SHO]] at the local police station. Her father gets angry upon receiving the letter and warns Shivjit to stay away from his daughter Bani and leave their neighbourhood.\n\nCircumstances change quickly as Bani's health deteriorates after being separated from Shivjit. Her father has no option but to go fetch Shivjit who can make her feel happy & help her during the recovery. Meanwhile, Shivjit's marriage is fixed, but Bani's father somehow convinces Shivjit's family to take him away for some days in the days of his need.\n\nAs Shivjit's time runs out of the days Bani's father asked him for, he starts packing up for his house. After returning Shivjit still thinks about Bani's health & he can't focus anywhere else. While wedding dress shopping with his future wife he professes his love for Bani to his future bride. He shares his love story of him and Bani together. The bride acutely understands his eternal love for Bani. She explains that it is better if Shivjit goes and take care of Bani instead and ends the engagement.\n\nAfter the positive reply, Shivjit happily plans of marrying his love Bani. He hires a car and a [[marching band]] to propose at the hospital where Bani is at. He then reaches to the hospital at night in the pouring rain, not realizing that Bani had died. Bani is wheeled out of the building in her hospital bed with a white cloth covering her body. Shivjit then starts to realize that Bani is dead and becomes emotional. He mourns with her family over her death, and the movie ends.\n\n==Cast==\n\n* [[Ammy Virk]] as Shivjit Singh Gill 'Shiva'\n* [[Sargun Mehta]] as Bani\n* [[Guggu Gill]] as SHO Gurnam Singh, Bani's father\n* [[Satwant Kaur]] as Bani's mother\n*[[Tania (Indian actress)|Tania]] as Amandeep Kaur 'Aman', Shivjit's fianc\u00e9\n* Harby Sangha as Golgappe Wala\n* Hardeep Gill as Shivjit's Taaya\n* Baljinder Kaur as Shivjit's Taayi\n* Raj Dhaliwal as Anmol Bhabi- PG Lady\n* Mandeep Mani as Himmatt Singh\n* Jasneet Kaur as Raavi, Bani's sister\n* Jashanjeet as Anmol Bhabi's husband\n* Gurpreet Bhangu as Hostel Warden\n* Honey Mattu as Laundry Guy\n* Ansh Tejpal as Ansh\n* Sumer Singh as Sumer\n* Samaya as Upma, Himachal girl\n* Manveer Rai as Nurse\n* Arvinder Bhatti as Doctor\n\n==Production==\n=== Development and pre-production ===\n\nA single titled ''Qismat'' was released by [[Ammy Virk]] starring [[Sargun Mehta]] in its music video which got huge success and was one of the most successful hits of Ammy Virk.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://m.mensxp.com/entertainment/celebrities/47100-6-ammy-virk-songs-you-need-to-listen-if-you-love-his-lsquo-qismat-rsquo.html|title=6 Ammy Virk Songs That Must Be On Your Playlist If 'Qismat' Is Your Jam|work=www.mensxp.com|access-date=2 September 2018|language=en}}</ref> When [[Jagdeep Sidhu]] was asked would their be any similarity between film and song, he denied by saying that genre of song was sad whereas film is [[romedy]].<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web\n |title       = Ammy Virk: Qismat is not a takeoff from Ammy Virk\u2019s song   Events Mov\u2026\n |url         = https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/events/chandigarh/qismat-is-not-a-takeoff-from-ammys-song/articleshow/63031560.cms?from=mdr\n |date        = 6 May 2019\n |archiveurl  = https://archive.today/20190506014913/https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/events/chandigarh/qismat-is-not-a-takeoff-from-ammys-song/articleshow/63031560.cms?from=mdr\n |archivedate = 6 May 2019\n |access-date = 6 May 2019\n |url-status  = live\n}}</ref> The film was written by Jagdeep Sidhu even before the release of song ''Qismat'' but was untitled yet.

There\u2019s nothing that can stop this one from becoming a blockbuster.\" Appreciating the writer and director of the film [[Jagdeep Sidhu]] reviewer said, \"Qismat is flawless. Writer Jagdeep Sidhu, who also makes his directorial debut with the movie, has conceived a beautiful journey of Ammy and Sargun\u2019s love. He makes sure that no other character besides the lead pair gets much importance, which eventually enhances the impact of the culmination.\" He also appreciates the cast of the film, saying, \"''Qismat'' belongs to Ammy Virk and Sargun Mehta. They are the heart and soul of the movie. They both give equally good, well-balanced and superlative performances. You cannot help but fall in love with their on-screen chemistry. They make you smile and cry a number of times in those two hours. It\u2019s hard to believe anyone else portraying Shivjit and Bani\u2019s roles. [[Guggu Gill]] is at his best, while Harby Sangha is funny as always.\" Reviewer also adds about the film soundtrack, \"B Praak and [[Sukh-E]] have provided the best soundtrack a Punjabi film has seen in many years. We won\u2019t be surprised if Kaun hoyega, Awaaz, and Fakira will be played on repeat on every playlist.\" Whereas criticised the film length, \"The movie stretches to 139 minutes, which feels a tad dragged. Had the first half been trimmed a bit, the impact would have been stronger.\" In last he adds, \"''Qismat'' makes you smile, laugh, fall in love, get separated, get together, and cry. Watch it for Ammy Virk and Sargun Mehta\u2019s chemistry, Jagdeep Sidhu\u2019s writing and direction, and also the soulful music.

Ammy, makes every word he says achievable in real life. He is one effortless actor who can make the audiences laugh, cry and now, believe in true love.

This was the highlighted topic in the comments section of the video/\n\n== Plot ==\n\nThe film begins when the main actor, Shivjit, asks his parents to send him off [[Chandigarh]] to go to college. He had already failed twice in obtaining his bachelor's degree. So Shivjit decides to make a pact with his parents that if he moves to the city, he will pass his exams. Shivjit's father is reluctant in sending his son to college and introduces the idea of marrying him off. However, his mother agrees to Shivjit's plan and lets him move to the city. Once he reaches Chandigarh, he immediately begins his search for a casual relationship. He quickly encounters Bani who had caught his attention in front of his new apartment building.\n\nBani is a beautiful young woman who is already in a relationship. Bani goes to visit her boyfriend in his apartment with food. She looks into her boyfriend bedroom and realizes that her boyfriend's cheating on her with a random woman in his bed. To make her ex-boyfriend jealous and teach him a lesson, Bani asks for Shivjit's help in posing as her fake boyfriend. As they continue their fake relationship, Shivjit and Bani start getting close and a start developing feelings for one another.\n\nHeartbroken and ashamed from her past relationship experiences Bani suggests to her father that she will get an arranged marriage to whomever he prefers. This doesn't sit well with Shivjit, and he sends a letter to Bani. He writes that she should marry someone she prefers and not a random stranger that her father picked. However, the letter ends up in her father's hands, who is an [[Station house officer|SHO]] at the local police station. Her father gets angry upon receiving the letter and warns Shivjit to stay away from his daughter Bani and leave their neighbourhood.\n\nCircumstances change quickly as Bani's health deteriorates after being separated from Shivjit. Her father has no option but to go fetch Shivjit who can make her feel happy & help her during the recovery. Meanwhile, Shivjit's marriage is fixed, but Bani's father somehow convinces Shivjit's family to take him away for some days in the days of his need.\n\nAs Shivjit's time runs out of the days Bani's father asked him for, he starts packing up for his house. After returning Shivjit still thinks about Bani's health & he can't focus anywhere else. While wedding dress shopping with his future wife he professes his love for Bani to his future bride. He shares his love story of him and Bani together. The bride acutely understands his eternal love for Bani. She explains that it is better if Shivjit goes and take care of Bani instead and ends the engagement.\n\nAfter the positive reply, Shivjit happily plans of marrying his love Bani. He hires a car and a [[marching band]] to propose at the hospital where Bani is at. He then reaches to the hospital at night in the pouring rain, not realizing that Bani had died. Bani is wheeled out of the building in her hospital bed with a white cloth covering her body. Shivjit then starts to realize that Bani is dead and becomes emotional. He mourns with her family over her death, and the movie ends.\n\n==Cast==\n\n* [[Ammy Virk]] as Shivjit Singh Gill 'Shiva'\n* [[Sargun Mehta]] as Bani\n* [[Guggu Gill]] as SHO Gurnam Singh, Bani's father\n* [[Satwant Kaur]] as Bani's mother\n*[[Tania (Indian actress)|Tania]] as Amandeep Kaur 'Aman', Shivjit's fianc\u00e9\n* Harby Sangha as Golgappe Wala\n* Hardeep Gill as Shivjit's Taaya\n* Baljinder Kaur as Shivjit's Taayi\n* Raj Dhaliwal as Anmol Bhabi- PG Lady\n* Mandeep Mani as Himmatt Singh\n* Jasneet Kaur as Raavi, Bani's sister\n* Jashanjeet as Anmol Bhabi's husband\n* Gurpreet Bhangu as Hostel Warden\n* Honey Mattu as Laundry Guy\n* Ansh Tejpal as Ansh\n* Sumer Singh as Sumer\n* Samaya as Upma, Himachal girl\n* Manveer Rai as Nurse\n* Arvinder Bhatti as Doctor\n\n==Production==\n=== Development and pre-production ===\n\nA single titled ''Qismat'' was released by [[Ammy Virk]] starring [[Sargun Mehta]] in its music video which got huge success and was one of the most successful hits of Ammy Virk.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://m.mensxp.com/entertainment/celebrities/47100-6-ammy-virk-songs-you-need-to-listen-if-you-love-his-lsquo-qismat-rsquo.html|title=6 Ammy Virk Songs That Must Be On Your Playlist If 'Qismat' Is Your Jam|work=www.mensxp.com|access-date=2 September 2018|language=en}}</ref> When [[Jagdeep Sidhu]] was asked would their be any similarity between film and song, he denied by saying that genre of song was sad whereas film is [[romedy]].<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web\n |title       = Ammy Virk: Qismat is not a takeoff from Ammy Virk\u2019s song   Events Mov\u2026\n |url         = https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/events/chandigarh/qismat-is-not-a-takeoff-from-ammys-song/articleshow/63031560.cms?from=mdr\n |date        = 6 May 2019\n |archiveurl  = https://archive.today/20190506014913/https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/events/chandigarh/qismat-is-not-a-takeoff-from-ammys-song/articleshow/63031560.cms?from=mdr\n |archivedate = 6 May 2019\n |access-date = 6 May 2019\n |url-status  = live\n}}</ref> The film was written by Jagdeep Sidhu even before the release of song ''Qismat'' but was untitled yet.

Writer Jagdeep Sidhu, who also makes his directorial debut with the movie, has conceived a beautiful journey of Ammy and Sargun\u2019s love. He makes sure that no other character besides the lead pair gets much importance, which eventually enhances the impact of the culmination.\" He also appreciates the cast of the film, saying, \"''Qismat'' belongs to Ammy Virk and Sargun Mehta. They are the heart and soul of the movie. They both give equally good, well-balanced and superlative performances. You cannot help but fall in love with their on-screen chemistry. They make you smile and cry a number of times in those two hours. It\u2019s hard to believe anyone else portraying Shivjit and Bani\u2019s roles. [[Guggu Gill]] is at his best, while Harby Sangha is funny as always.\" Reviewer also adds about the film soundtrack, \"B Praak and [[Sukh-E]] have provided the best soundtrack a Punjabi film has seen in many years. We won\u2019t be surprised if Kaun hoyega, Awaaz, and Fakira will be played on repeat on every playlist.\" Whereas criticised the film length, \"The movie stretches to 139 minutes, which feels a tad dragged. Had the first half been trimmed a bit, the impact would have been stronger.\" In last he adds, \"''Qismat'' makes you smile, laugh, fall in love, get separated, get together, and cry. Watch it for Ammy Virk and Sargun Mehta\u2019s chemistry, Jagdeep Sidhu\u2019s writing and direction, and also the soulful music. Grab your tissues and handkerchiefs and make a move towards cinema halls. This one is strongly recommended!\"<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite news|url=https://in.bookmyshow.com/discover/movies/reviews/punjabi-reviews/qismat-film-review/amp|title=[Review] Qismat: Grab Some Tissues Because This Film Is Definitely A Tearjerker!|date=21 September 2018|work=BookMyShow|access-date=21 September 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n''Jasmine Singh'' of [[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]] also appreciates the Debut Director Jagdeep Sidhu, saying, \"Only a few directors have managed to dabble with romance on screen, and Jagdeep Sidhu is one such director who has handled the subject with \u2018love\u2019.\" Reviewer adds about dialogues, \"The dialogues in the film are light yet hitting, in fact it has hundred romantic pick up lines that might come to your rescue someday.

Seeing Rosie with wealthy men further sparks his dream of becoming a \"big-shot\", believing that if he manages to become rich, he might win Rosie's heart. Balraj and his friend Chimman ([[Satyadeep Mishra]]) then catch the eye of Kaizad Khambatta ([[Karan Johar]]), a wealthy businessman who is impressed by Balraj and offers him the chance to manage his club \"Bombay Velvet\", which Khambatta uses to further his illegal tasks and activities. He also nicknames Balraj \"Johnny\", which then becomes his identification. As well as this, Johnny and Chimman fulfill minor tasks for Khambatta, including capturing a dirty photograph of a minister who Khambatta wants to blackmail. This news reaches Jimmy Mistri, a media reporter, who also happens to be the same wealthy man Johnny had previously seen Rosie with.\n\nRemembering that Johnny has a crush on Rosie, Mistri takes advantage of this and sends Rosie to Johnny's club to get her hands on the photograph of the minister. However, Rosie and Johnny eventually fall in love, and Mistri threatens to reveal Rosie's true identity to Johnny. Therefore, Rosie begins to supply information about Johnny & Khambatta's activities to Mistri. After a photograph of a secret meeting between Bombay's big-shots is leaked, Khambatta guesses that it was Rosie supplying the information and orders her to be killed. Johnny hears of this and forms an enmity with Khambatta, the man who brought him into the crime world.\n\nJohnny fakes Rosie's death and makes her act as if she is her long dead twin sister Rita. But soon Khambatta realises the truth, kidnaps Rosie and tries to kill Johnny and they get into a standoff at Bombay Velvet. Khambatta shoots Rosie to provoke Johnny. Johnny angry at this stabs Khambatta and is himself shot dead while trying to carry Rosie to the hospital, outside the club.

Balraj and his friend Chimman ([[Satyadeep Mishra]]) then catch the eye of Kaizad Khambatta ([[Karan Johar]]), a wealthy businessman who is impressed by Balraj and offers him the chance to manage his club \"Bombay Velvet\", which Khambatta uses to further his illegal tasks and activities. He also nicknames Balraj \"Johnny\", which then becomes his identification. As well as this, Johnny and Chimman fulfill minor tasks for Khambatta, including capturing a dirty photograph of a minister who Khambatta wants to blackmail. This news reaches Jimmy Mistri, a media reporter, who also happens to be the same wealthy man Johnny had previously seen Rosie with.\n\nRemembering that Johnny has a crush on Rosie, Mistri takes advantage of this and sends Rosie to Johnny's club to get her hands on the photograph of the minister. However, Rosie and Johnny eventually fall in love, and Mistri threatens to reveal Rosie's true identity to Johnny. Therefore, Rosie begins to supply information about Johnny & Khambatta's activities to Mistri. After a photograph of a secret meeting between Bombay's big-shots is leaked, Khambatta guesses that it was Rosie supplying the information and orders her to be killed. Johnny hears of this and forms an enmity with Khambatta, the man who brought him into the crime world.\n\nJohnny fakes Rosie's death and makes her act as if she is her long dead twin sister Rita. But soon Khambatta realises the truth, kidnaps Rosie and tries to kill Johnny and they get into a standoff at Bombay Velvet. Khambatta shoots Rosie to provoke Johnny. Johnny angry at this stabs Khambatta and is himself shot dead while trying to carry Rosie to the hospital, outside the club.

The advent of totalitarianism marked the beginning of a new political era in the 20th century. This form of government is characterized by the presence of a single political party and more specifically, by a powerful leader (a real [[role model]]) who imposes his personal and political prominence. The two fundamental aspects that contribute to the maintenance of the power are: a steadfast collaboration between the government and the police force, and a highly developed ideology. Here, the government has \"total control of mass communications and social and economic organizations\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=McLaughlin|first=Neil|date=2010|title=Review: Totalitarianism, Social Science, and the Margins.|jstor=canajsocicahican.35.3.463|journal=The Canadian Journal of Sociology|volume= 35| issue =  3|pages= 463\u201369|doi=10.29173/cjs8876|doi-access=free}}</ref> According to [[Hannah Arendt]], totalitarianism is a new and extreme form of dictatorship composed of \"atomized, isolated individuals\".<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|url=http://public.eblib.com/choice/publicfullrecord.aspx?p=661026|title=Dictators and dictatorships: understanding authoritarian regimes and their leaders|last=Ezrow|first=Natasha M|last2=Frantz|first2=Erica|date=2011|publisher=Continuum|isbn=978-1-4411-1602-4|location=New York|pages=|language=English}}</ref> In addition, she affirmed that ideology plays a leading role in defining how the entire society should be organized.

In [[Barbara Geddes (academic)|Barbara Geddes]]'s study, she focused in how elite-leader and elite-mass relations influence [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] politics. Geddes typology identifies the key institutions that structure elite politics in dictatorships (i.e. parties and militaries). The study is based on, and directly related to, factors like: the simplicity of the categorizations, cross-national applicability, the emphasis on elites and leaders, and the incorporation of institutions (parties and militaries) as central to shaping politics. According to Barbara Geddes, a dictatorial government may be classified in five typologies: Military Dictatorships, Single-party Dictatorships, Personalist Dictatorships, [[Monarchy|Monarchies]], Hybrid Dictatorships.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\n=== Military dictatorships ===\n{{main|Military dictatorship}}\nMilitary dictatorships are regimes in which a group of officers holds power, determines who will lead the country, and exercises influence over policy. High-level [[elite]]s and a [[Leadership|leader]] are the members of the military dictatorship. Military dictatorships are characterized by rule by a professionalized military as an institution. In military regimes, elites are referred to as junta members; they are typically senior officers (and often other high-level officers) in the military.<ref name=\":02\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Friedrich|first=Carl|date=1950|title=Military Government and Dictatorship.|journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|volume= 267|pages= 1\u20137|oclc=5723774494|doi=10.1177/000271625026700102}}</ref>\n\n=== Single-party dictatorships ===\n{{Main|One-party state}}\nSingle-party dictatorships are regimes in which one party dominates politics. In single-party dictatorships, a single party has access to political posts and control over policy. In single-party dictatorships, party elites are typically members of the ruling body of the party, sometimes called the [[central committee]], [[politburo]], or [[Secretariat (administrative office)|secretariat]]. These groups of individuals controls the selection of party officials and \"organizes the distribution of benefits to supporters and mobilizes citizens to vote and show support for party leaders\".<ref name=\":02\"/>\n\n=== Personalist dictatorships ===\nPersonalist dictatorships are regimes in which all power lies in the hands of a single individual. Personalist dictatorships differ from other forms of dictatorships in their access to key political positions, other fruits of office, and depend much more on the discretion of the personalist dictator. Personalist dictators may be members of the military or leaders of a political party. Yet, neither the military nor the party exercises power independent from the dictator. In personalist dictatorships, the elite corps is usually made up of close friends or family members of the dictator. These individuals are all typically handpicked to serve their posts by the dictator.<ref name=\":02\"/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Peceny|first=Mark|date=2003|title=Peaceful Parties and Puzzling Personalists.|journal=The American Political Science Review|volume= 97| issue =  2|pages= 339\u201342|oclc=208155326|doi=10.1017/s0003055403000716}}</ref>\n\nAccording to a 2019 study, personalist dictatorships are more repressive than other forms of dictatorship.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Frantz|first=Erica|last2=Kendall-Taylor|first2=Andrea|last3=Wright|first3=Joseph|last4=Xu|first4=Xu|date=2019-08-27|title=Personalization of Power and Repression in Dictatorships|url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/706049|journal=The Journal of Politics|pages=000\u2013000|doi=10.1086/706049|issn=0022-3816}}</ref>\n\n=== Monarchic dictatorships ===\n{{main|Absolute monarchy}}\n[[File:Salman of Saudi Arabia (2017-10-05) 2.jpg|thumb|King [[Salman of Saudi Arabia]]<ref>\"[http://www.dawn.com/news/1159990 Call them \u2018Dictators\u2019, not \u2018Kings\u2019]\".

Roman dictators were allocated absolute power during times of emergency. In execution, their power was originally neither arbitrary nor unaccountable, being subject to law and requiring retrospective justification. There were no such dictatorships after the beginning of the 2nd century BC and later dictators such as [[Sulla]] and the [[Roman Emperor]]s exercised power much more personally and arbitrarily. As the Roman Emperor was a [[king]] in all but name, a concept that remained anathema to traditional Roman society, the institution was not carried forward into the [[Roman Empire]].\n\n=== Logang19th-century Latin American caudillos ===\n{{main|Caudillo}}\n[[File:Santaanna1.JPG|170px|thumb|right|Logang]]\nAfter the collapse of Spanish colonial rule, various dictators came to power in many liberated countries. Often leading a private army, these ''[[caudillo]]s'' or self-appointed political-military leaders, attacked weak national [[government]]s once they controlled a region's political and economic powers, with examples such as [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]] in Mexico and [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]] in Argentina. Such dictators have been also referred to as \"[[personalismo]]s\".\n\nThe wave of [[military dictatorship]]s in South America in the second half of the twentieth century left a particular mark on [[Latin American culture]]. In [[Latin American literature]], the [[dictator novel]] challenging dictatorship and ''[[caudillo|caudillismo]]'' is a significant genre. There are also many [[films depicting Latin American military dictatorships]].\n\n=== Communism and Fascism in 20th-century dictatorships ===\nIn the first half of the 20th century, [[Communism|Communist]] and [[Fascism|Fascist]] dictatorships appeared in a variety of scientifically and technologically advanced countries, which are distinct from dictatorships in Latin America and post-colonial dictatorships in Africa and Asia. Leading examples of modern totalitarian dictatorship include:\n* [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Nazi Germany]], [[Hideki Tojo]]'s [[Empire of Japan|Japan]], [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[Kingdom of Italy under Fascism (1922-1943)|Italy]], [[Francisco Franco]]'s [[Francoist Spain|Spain]], and [[Ion Antonescu]]'s [[Romania]].\n\n* [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]'s [[Soviet Union]], [[Mao Zedong]] and [[Xi Jinping]]'s [[People's Republic of China]], [[Kim dynasty (North Korea)|Kim dynasty]]'s North Korea, [[Ho Chi Minh]]'s [[Vietnam]], [[Nicolae Ceau\u015fescu]]'s [[Romania]], the [[Khmer Rouge]] in [[Cambodia]],  and other Communist dictatorships that appeared after [[World War II]] in Central Europe, Eastern Europe, East Asia, Latin America, Africa and other countries.\n\n===Dictatorships in Africa and Asia after World War II===\n[[File:Prins Bernhard in Zaire (voorheen Belgisch Congo), Bernhard en Mobutu, Bestanddeelnr 926-6037.jpg|thumb|170px|[[Mobutu Sese Seko]], Zaire's longtime dictator]]\nAfter World War II, dictators established themselves in the several new states of Africa and Asia, often at the expense or failure of the constitutions inherited from the colonial powers. These constitutions often failed to work without a strong middle class or work against the preexisting autocratic rule. Some elected presidents and prime ministers captured power by suppressing the opposition and installing one-party rule and others established military dictatorships through their armies.

These bandits provide a disincentive for investment and production. Olson states that a community of individuals would be better served if that bandit were to establish himself as a stationary bandit to monopolize theft in the form of taxes. Except from the community, the bandits themselves will be better served, according to Olson, by transforming themselves into \"stationary bandits\". By settling down and making themselves the rulers of a territory, they will be able to make more profits through taxes than they used to obtain through plunder. By maintaining order and providing protection to the community, the bandits will create a peaceful environment in which their people can maximize their surplus which means a greater taxable base. Thus a potential dictator will have a greater incentive to provide security to a given community from which he is extracting taxes and conversely, the people from whom he extracts the taxes are more likely to produce because they will be unconcerned with potential theft by other bandits. This is the rationality that bandits use in order to justify their transformation from \"roving bandits\" into \"stationary bandits\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Olson|first=Mancur|date=1993|title=Dictatorship, Democracy, and Development|url=|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=87|issue=3|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Absolute monarchy]]\n* [[Autocracy]]\n* [[Benevolent dictatorship]]\n* [[Military dictatorship#Civil-military dictatorship|Civil-military dictatorship]]\n* [[Constitutional dictatorship]]\n* [[Stalinism]]\n* [[Maoism]]\n* [[Juche]]\n* [[Dictatorship of the bourgeoisie]]\n* [[Dictatorship of the proletariat]]\n* [[Elective dictatorship]]\n* [[Family dictatorship]]\n* ''[[How Democracies Die]]''\n* [[Military dictatorship]]\n* [[Generalissimo]]\n* [[List of titles used by dictators]]\n* [[Maximum Leader (disambiguation)|Maximum Leader]]\n* [[Mobutism]]\n* [[Nazism]]\n* [[Fascism]]\n* [[People's democratic dictatorship]]\n* [[Right-wing dictatorship]]\n* [[Selectorate theory]]\n* [[Strongman (politics)|Strongman]]\n* [[Supreme leader]]\n* [[Theocracy]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* [http://docupedia.de/zg/Behrends_dictatorship_v2_en_2017 Behrends, Jan C.

The advent of totalitarianism marked the beginning of a new political era in the 20th century. This form of government is characterized by the presence of a single political party and more specifically, by a powerful leader (a real [[role model]]) who imposes his personal and political prominence. The two fundamental aspects that contribute to the maintenance of the power are: a steadfast collaboration between the government and the police force, and a highly developed ideology. Here, the government has \"total control of mass communications and social and economic organizations\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=McLaughlin|first=Neil|date=2010|title=Review: Totalitarianism, Social Science, and the Margins.|jstor=canajsocicahican.35.3.463|journal=The Canadian Journal of Sociology|volume= 35| issue =  3|pages= 463\u201369|doi=10.29173/cjs8876|doi-access=free}}</ref> According to [[Hannah Arendt]], totalitarianism is a new and extreme form of dictatorship composed of \"atomized, isolated individuals\".<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|url=http://public.eblib.com/choice/publicfullrecord.aspx?p=661026|title=Dictators and dictatorships: understanding authoritarian regimes and their leaders|last=Ezrow|first=Natasha M|last2=Frantz|first2=Erica|date=2011|publisher=Continuum|isbn=978-1-4411-1602-4|location=New York|pages=|language=English}}</ref> In addition, she affirmed that ideology plays a leading role in defining how the entire society should be organized.

In [[Barbara Geddes (academic)|Barbara Geddes]]'s study, she focused in how elite-leader and elite-mass relations influence [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] politics. Geddes typology identifies the key institutions that structure elite politics in dictatorships (i.e. parties and militaries). The study is based on, and directly related to, factors like: the simplicity of the categorizations, cross-national applicability, the emphasis on elites and leaders, and the incorporation of institutions (parties and militaries) as central to shaping politics. According to Barbara Geddes, a dictatorial government may be classified in five typologies: Military Dictatorships, Single-party Dictatorships, Personalist Dictatorships, [[Monarchy|Monarchies]], Hybrid Dictatorships.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\n=== Military dictatorships ===\n{{main|Military dictatorship}}\nMilitary dictatorships are regimes in which a group of officers holds power, determines who will lead the country, and exercises influence over policy. High-level [[elite]]s and a [[Leadership|leader]] are the members of the military dictatorship. Military dictatorships are characterized by rule by a professionalized military as an institution.

In single-party dictatorships, a single party has access to political posts and control over policy. In single-party dictatorships, party elites are typically members of the ruling body of the party, sometimes called the [[central committee]], [[politburo]], or [[Secretariat (administrative office)|secretariat]].

Personalist dictatorships differ from other forms of dictatorships in their access to key political positions, other fruits of office, and depend much more on the discretion of the personalist dictator. Personalist dictators may be members of the military or leaders of a political party. Yet, neither the military nor the party exercises power independent from the dictator. In personalist dictatorships, the elite corps is usually made up of close friends or family members of the dictator.

There were no such dictatorships after the beginning of the 2nd century BC and later dictators such as [[Sulla]] and the [[Roman Emperor]]s exercised power much more personally and arbitrarily. As the Roman Emperor was a [[king]] in all but name, a concept that remained anathema to traditional Roman society, the institution was not carried forward into the [[Roman Empire]].\n\n=== 19th-century Latin American caudillos ===\n{{main|Caudillo}}\n[[File:Santaanna1.JPG|170px|thumb|right|[[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]] wearing [[Mexico|Mexican]] military uniform]]\nAfter the collapse of Spanish colonial rule, various dictators came to power in many liberated countries. Often leading a private army, these ''[[caudillo]]s'' or self-appointed political-military leaders, attacked weak national [[government]]s once they controlled a region's political and economic powers, with examples such as [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]] in Mexico and [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]] in Argentina. Such dictators have been also referred to as \"[[personalismo]]s\".\n\nThe wave of [[military dictatorship]]s in South America in the second half of the twentieth century left a particular mark on [[Latin American culture]]. In [[Latin American literature]], the [[dictator novel]] challenging dictatorship and ''[[caudillo|caudillismo]]'' is a significant genre. There are also many [[films depicting Latin American military dictatorships]].\n\n=== Communism and Fascism in 20th-century dictatorships ===\nIn the first half of the 20th century, [[Communism|Communist]] and [[Fascism|Fascist]] dictatorships appeared in a variety of scientifically and technologically advanced countries, which are distinct from dictatorships in Latin America and post-colonial dictatorships in Africa and Asia. Leading examples of modern totalitarian dictatorship include:\n* [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Nazi Germany]], [[Hideki Tojo]]'s [[Empire of Japan|Japan]], [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[Kingdom of Italy under Fascism (1922-1943)|Italy]], [[Francisco Franco]]'s [[Francoist Spain|Spain]], and [[Ion Antonescu]]'s [[Romania]].\n\n* [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]'s [[Soviet Union]], [[Mao Zedong]] and [[Xi Jinping]]'s [[People's Republic of China]], [[Kim dynasty (North Korea)|Kim dynasty]]'s North Korea, [[Ho Chi Minh]]'s [[Vietnam]], [[Nicolae Ceau\u015fescu]]'s [[Romania]], the [[Khmer Rouge]] in [[Cambodia]],  and other Communist dictatorships that appeared after [[World War II]] in Central Europe, Eastern Europe, East Asia, Latin America, Africa and other countries.\n\n===Dictatorships in Africa and Asia after World War II===\n[[File:Prins Bernhard in Zaire (voorheen Belgisch Congo), Bernhard en Mobutu, Bestanddeelnr 926-6037.jpg|thumb|170px|[[Mobutu Sese Seko]], Zaire's longtime dictator]]\nAfter World War II, dictators established themselves in the several new states of Africa and Asia, often at the expense or failure of the constitutions inherited from the colonial powers. These constitutions often failed to work without a strong middle class or work against the preexisting autocratic rule. Some elected presidents and prime ministers captured power by suppressing the opposition and installing one-party rule and others established military dictatorships through their armies. Whatever their form, these dictatorships had an adverse impact on economic growth and the quality of political institutions.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Papaioannou|first=Kostadis|author2=vanZanden, Jan Luiten|date=2015|title=The Dictator Effect: How long years in office affect economic development|journal=Journal of Institutional Economics|volume=11|issue=1|pages=111\u201339|doi=10.1017/S1744137414000356|pmid=}}</ref> Dictators who stayed in office for a long period of time found it increasingly difficult to carry out sound economic policies.\n\nThe often-cited exploitative dictatorship is the regime of [[Mobutu Sese Seko]], who ruled [[Zaire]] from 1965 to 1997, embezzling over $5&nbsp;billion from his country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/9709/07/mobutu.wrap/|title=Mobutu dies in exile in Morocco|author=|date=7 September 1997|work=CNN}}</ref> Pakistan is another country to have been governed by 3 military dictators for almost 32 years in 7 decades of its existence.

These bandits provide a disincentive for investment and production. Olson states that a community of individuals would be better served if that bandit were to establish himself as a stationary bandit to monopolize theft in the form of taxes. Except from the community, the bandits themselves will be better served, according to Olson, by transforming themselves into \"stationary bandits\". By settling down and making themselves the rulers of a territory, they will be able to make more profits through taxes than they used to obtain through plunder. By maintaining order and providing protection to the community, the bandits will create a peaceful environment in which their people can maximize their surplus which means a greater taxable base. Thus a potential dictator will have a greater incentive to provide security to a given community from which he is extracting taxes and conversely, the people from whom he extracts the taxes are more likely to produce because they will be unconcerned with potential theft by other bandits. This is the rationality that bandits use in order to justify their transformation from \"roving bandits\" into \"stationary bandits\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Olson|first=Mancur|date=1993|title=Dictatorship, Democracy, and Development|url=|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=87|issue=3|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Absolute monarchy]]\n* [[Autocracy]]\n* [[Benevolent dictatorship]]\n* [[Military dictatorship#Civil-military dictatorship|Civil-military dictatorship]]\n* [[Constitutional dictatorship]]\n* [[Stalinism]]\n* [[Maoism]]\n* [[Juche]]\n* [[Dictatorship of the bourgeoisie]]\n* [[Dictatorship of the proletariat]]\n* [[Elective dictatorship]]\n* [[Family dictatorship]]\n* ''[[How Democracies Die]]''\n* [[Military dictatorship]]\n* [[Generalissimo]]\n* [[List of titles used by dictators]]\n* [[Maximum Leader (disambiguation)|Maximum Leader]]\n* [[Mobutism]]\n* [[Nazism]]\n* [[Fascism]]\n* [[People's democratic dictatorship]]\n* [[Right-wing dictatorship]]\n* [[Selectorate theory]]\n* [[Strongman (politics)|Strongman]]\n* [[Supreme leader]]\n* [[Theocracy]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* [http://docupedia.de/zg/Behrends_dictatorship_v2_en_2017 Behrends, Jan C.
