Constructed from an earlier [[2-8-0]] locomotive built in 1923, the 2101 handled heavy coal train traffic for the Reading until being retired in 1959. Withheld from scrapping, the 2101 served as emergency backup power for the three other T1 locomotives serving the Reading's \"Iron Horse Rambler\" excursions until being sold for scrap in 1964. In 1975, the locomotive was restored to operation from scrapyard condition in an emergency 30-day overhaul after being selected to pull the first eastern portion of the [[American Freedom Train]]. On March 7, 1979, while being stored one winter in a Chessie System roundhouse in Silver Grove, KY, 2101 was severely damaged in a fire. Also damaged in that fire was a NYC Mohawk tender, which is now located at the NYC Railroad Museum in Elkhart, IN. 2101 was cosmetically restored and placed in the [[Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Museum]] on Labor Day, 1979, in exchange for [[Chesapeake and Ohio 614]]. Today the locomotive remains on display in its American Freedom Train paint scheme.\n\n==History 1923 to 1974==\nReading 2101 is a [[Reading T-1|T1 class]] 4-8-4 steam locomotive that was one of 30 4-8-4s that were converted from 30 I-10sa 2-8-0 Consolidation locomotives from 1945 through 1947 by the Reading Railroad when management wanted faster and more powerful locomotives, but had no spare cash to order completely new ones. Starting in 1945 the Reading took 30 of its 2-8-0s and converted them with a little help from [[Baldwin Locomotive Works]] into 30 new 4-8-4 locomotives that were numbered 2100-2129 and classified as class \"T1\". 2101 was originally built by Baldwin in 1923 as I-10a 2-8-0 #2021 and was converted to Reading 2101 in 1945. For its entire service life, 2101 pulled many freight and passenger trains from 1945 to 1956 when nearly all steam on the Reading was sent to [[scrap]], except for five T1s: 2100, 2101, 2102, 2123 and 2124. 2101 was cared for in the Reading's Roundhouse from 1959 to 1964 as a standby locomotive for the famous \"Iron Horse Rambles\". October 17, 1964, saw the 50th and last Ramble excursion when rising operational costs and deteriorating track forced the end of these special fan trips.\n\n==The 1975\u201376 American Freedom Train to present day==\nIn 1975, the country was gearing up for America's Bicentennial and plans were underway for The [[American Freedom Train]] which would travel across the country stopping in dozens of cities and pulled by steam locomotives. Led by [[Ross Rowland]], a nationwide search was carried out to search for locomotives in restorable condition to pull the train. [[Southern Pacific 4449]] and Reading 2101 were selected for the trip (A group of dedicated preservationists in Ft. Worth also rebuilt a steam locomotive that would pull the train in Texas, [[Texas and Pacific 610]]). 2101 was pulled from the scrapyard and restored to operating condition in only 30 days in the same building where she was constructed from a 2-8-0 nearly 30 years earlier\u2014and painted as \"American Freedom Train #1\". \n\n2101 pulled the eastern section of the trip before giving it to the 4449 in Chicago for the western section. On the return trip east, 2101 again took charge of the train at Birmingham, AL and pulled the train through much of New England, handing the train back to the 4449 at the Pentagon. Less than two years later, 2101 was repainted into a bright yellow and orange livery and pulled many excursions arranged by Ross Rowland on the [[Chessie System]] as the \"Chessie Steam Special\" before becoming victim to a 1979 roundhouse fire in Kentucky. While most damage was cosmetic, she was damaged to such an extent that she would need a complete overhaul to be in service after the fire. It was then decided that 2101 was to be traded to the [[B&O Railroad Museum|B&O Museum]] for [[Chesapeake & Ohio 614]] where it would haul the 1981 Chessie Safety Express from Baltimore to Hagerstown and return. Since then she has been cosmetically restored as \"American Freedom Train #1\" and is on static display. Upon restoration after the fire, her tender was swapped for the tender belonging to 2100. When locomotive 2100 was restored, the 2101 tender was also restored and converted to [[Fuel oil|oil]]. The 2100 loco and 2101 tender were stored together in [[Richland, Washington]] until April 2015 when they were shipped to [[Cleveland, Ohio]] for restoration to operating condition, and will be converted back to burn coal once again.\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite web| website=The Story of America's Freedom Trains| url=http://www.freedomtrain.org/american-freedom-train-consist-main.htm| title=Locomotives and Equipment| accessdate=January 17, 2006}}\n* {{cite web| website=SteamLocomotive.com| url=http://www.steamlocomotive.com/northern/reading/| title=The Reading T-1| accessdate=January 17, 2006}}\n*\n\n==External links==\n* {{Commons category-inline|Reading Company 2101}}\n*[http://www.freedomtrain.org/american-freedom-train-consist-2101-reading-t1.htm Reading 2101 and the 1975-1976 Bicentennial American Freedom Train]\n*[http://www.readingrailroad.org/profiles/rdg_profile_steam_t1.html#2101_surviving Surviving T1s]\n*[http://themetrains.com/chessie-steam-special-main.htm Reading 2101 and the 1977-1978 Chessie Steam Special]\n\n[[Category:Individual locomotives of the United States]]\n[[Category:4-8-4 locomotives]]\n[[Category:Baldwin locomotives]]\n[[Category:Philadelphia and Reading Railroad locomotives]]\n[[Category:Freight locomotives]]\n[[Category:Reading Company|2101]]\n[[Category:Preserved steam locomotives of the United States]]\n[[Category:Standard gauge locomotives of the United States]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=July 2016}}\n{{Infobox locomotive\n| name=Reading 2101\n| powertype=Steam\n| image            = 1976 - American Freedom Train Engine.jpg\n| caption          = Reading 2101 pulls the ''American Freedom Train'' as AFT 1\n| builder          = [[Baldwin Locomotive Works]]\n| builddate        = 1923\n| serialnumber     = \n| rebuilder        = Reading Company\n| rebuilddate      = September 1945\n| whytetype        = ''New:'' [[2-8-0]],<br>''Rebuilt:'' [[4-8-4]] \n| gauge            = {{Track gauge|ussg|allk=on}}\n| leadingdiameter  = \n| driverdiameter   = {{convert|70|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| trailingdiameter = \n| length           = {{convert|110|ft|6|in|m|2|abbr=on}}\n| weightondrivers  = {{convert|278200|lb|kg t|abbr=in|sp=us}}\n| locoweight       = {{convert|441300|lb|kg t|abbr=in|sp=us}}\n| locotenderweight = {{convert|809000|lb|kg t|abbr=in|sp=us}}\n| fueltype         = [[Anthracite|Anthracite coal]]\n| fuelcap          = {{convert|52000|lb|kg t|abbr=in|sp=us}}\n| watercap         = {{convert|19000|usgal}} \n| boilerpressure   = {{convert|240|lbf/in2|MPa|2|abbr=on}}\n| firearea         = {{convert|94.5|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}\n| cylindercount    = Two, outside\n| cylindersize     = {{convert|27|x|32|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| tractiveeffort   = ''Loco:'' {{convert|68000|lbf|kN|1|abbr=on}},<br>''[[booster engine|Booster]]'' {{convert|11100|lbf|kN|1|abbr=on}}\n| factorofadhesion = 4.09\n| operator         = [[Reading Company]]\n| operatorclass    = ''New:'' I-10a<br>''Rebuilt:''  [[Reading T-1|T-1]]\n| numinclass       = 20\n| nicknames        = [[American Freedom Train]] #1 George S.

In other countries, it is advertised as Disney Channel Original Movie.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} It was planned to have its UK premiere on November 19, 2010 on [[Disney Channel (UK & Ireland)|Disney Channel UK]], but was replaced with ''[[Starstruck (2010 film)|Starstruck]]'', which had already been shown in May; it was later shown in December 2010 in the UK.\n\n==Plot==\nAbby Jensen has been planning for her [[sweet sixteen (birthday)|sweet sixteen birthday]] since she was a little girl. She keeps a list of wishes that she wants to come true. When the big day finally arrives, she excitedly adds her sixteenth and final wish to the list: a photo of Logan, her crush. Her parents and her brother Mike surprise her, but she rejects them.\n\nThen begins the first of many unusual occurrences, each involving visits from a peculiar woman, Celeste. She first appears as an exterminator when the Jensens' house gets overrun by wasps from a nest that had been building up for 16 years. Celeste saves Abby's wish list, but the family is unable to go back inside their house until the wasps are exterminated.\n\nAbby's best friend, Jay Kepler, appears and offers Abby his jacket. When Abby reaches into a pocket, she finds a birthday present for her\u2014a necklace with a half of a heart saying \"BFF.\" Jay uses the other half as a charm on his key ring. A delivery truck pulls up, and Celeste comes out dressed as a mail woman and gives a package with 16 candles and a matchbox to Abby. Abby lights the first candle, her first wish, meeting celebrity Joey Lockhart, is fulfilled. Abby then realizes that the candles correspond to the wishes on her wish list. Abby lights up the eighth candle and her wish for a red car is fulfilled. Out of the car comes Celeste. Abby realizes Celeste is a magical being and her wishes come true each time a candle is lit, and Celeste appears whenever a wish is granted.\n\nAbby unsuccessfully tries to make a third wish. Celeste explains that Abby must wait to make new wishes within new hours, and that, at midnight, Abby's candles expire and the wishes she made will be permanent. Abby makes more wishes, causing her to beat her nemesis, Krista Cook, who has the same birthday as her, in a volleyball match, and become student body president.\n\nAbby remembers that she needs a dress for her birthday party and decides buy it with Jay, who agrees to pay for it. They are followed by Krista, who takes Jay's wallet when he drops it. She convinces the store clerk that the two are not actually going to buy anything; the clerk kicks them out. Abby uses the 9th candle to make a wish to be treated like an adult, which adds consequences of adulthood that she did not think of. Abby is suddenly not allowed to attend high school anymore, and no one at school remembers her, not even Jay. Her parents buy her a new apartment and leave her to live on her own.\n\nRegretting her wish, Abby unsuccessfully tries to make new wishes and change some. Abby makes a wish for her parents to understand her; her parents do understand her, but under the impression that she is an adult. Abby walks by Krista's Sweet 16 and spots Jay. She restores Jay's memories that they are best friends by showing him the necklace he gave her. However, Jay is unable to help her. Abby talks to Krista, and realizes that she is on good terms with her in adulthood. She also realizes that Jay wanted to be student body president all along.\n\nDesperate, Abby returns to her apartment where Celeste appears. Abby talks with Celeste as she tells her how selfish she was for thinking about herself over her friends and family due to not seeing what she already had. Abby eventually found a loophole through the rules of magic because her last wish was glued on with gum, acting as a \"barrier\" between the picture and the rules. She switches the picture for a picture of her taken that morning and wishes she could go back to that morning right before midnight strikes.\n\nAbby's life then goes back to normal. Abby throws her wish list away and gives her money to Mike for a guitar. Abby finds Krista carrying posters saying 'Vote For Krista.' She and Krista reconcile after Krista tells Abby that she dislikes her because she took Jay away from her as a friend. Abby and Krista stop competing and work together to make Jay student body president, fulfilling his dream. Abby and Krista have a joint birthday party. Krista and Logan become a couple, and Mike's talent is recognized. Abby tells Jay that she has no more wishes, and they kiss. Celeste then turns into a fairy and flies away. The couples\u2014Abby and Jay and Krista and Logan\u2014then dance together at the party.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Debby Ryan]] as Abigail \"Abby\" Louise Jensen\n* [[Jean-Luc Bilodeau]] as Jay Kepler\n* [[Anna Mae Routledge]] as Celeste\n* Karissa Tynes as Krista Cook\n* Keenan Tracey as Logan Buchanan\n* Joel Semande as Joey Lockhart\n* [[Cainan Wiebe]] as Mike Jensen\n* [[Patrick Gilmore (actor)|Patrick Gilmore]] as Bob Jensen\n* Kendall Cross  as Sue Jensen\n* [[Jesse Reid]] as Theodore Hope\n*Brenda Crichlow as Miss Duffy\n*Patricia Isaac as Snooty Sales Woman\n* [[Gary Jones (actor)|Gary Jones]] as Principal Smith\n* Kailey Cross as 8-year-old Abby\n}}\n\n==Production==\nSome scenes were filmed at [[Walnut Grove Secondary School]] in [[Langley, British Columbia (district municipality)|Langley, British Columbia]].\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = 16 Wishes\n| type       = [[Soundtrack]]\n| artist     = Various artists\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| caption    = {{deletable image-caption|Thursday, 20 September 2018|PROD}}\n| released   = June 15, 2010<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/16-wishes-soundtrack/id376436116|title=16 Wishes Soundtrack1|publisher=iTunes|accessdate=June 4, 2011}}</ref>\n| recorded   = 2010\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Soundtrack]]\n| length     = 28:32\n| label      = [[MarVista Entertainment]]\n| producer   = Various artists\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\n''16 Wishes'' is the soundtrack album for the film of the same name, released on June 15, 2010, by [[MarVista Entertainment]].\n\n===Track listing===\n{{Track listing\n| extra_column    = Performer(s)\n| total_length    = 28:32\n\n| title1           = A Wish Comes True Everyday\n| extra1           = [[Debby Ryan]]\n| length1          = 3:10\n\n| title2           = No One's Fool\n| extra2           = [[Keith Macpherson|Keith & Renee]]\n| length2          = 3:15\n\n| title3           = Princess Girl\n| extra3           = Minnutes\n| length3          = 3:21\n\n| title4           = Bad Momma\n| extra4           = Chad Gendason\n| length4          = 2:19\n\n| title5           = Saying Goodbye\n| extra5           = Chase Ryan\n| length5          = 2:44\n| note             = featuring Michaele Popp Aaron Harvey\n\n| title6           = Picture Perfect\n| extra6           = Jennifer Cathcart\n| length6          = 3:14\n\n| title7           = The Way It Used To Be\n| extra7           = [[Not by Choice]]\n| length7          = 4:05\n\n| title8           = Vertigo\n| extra8           = Willknots\n| length8          = 3:38\n\n| title9           = Overreaction\n| extra9           = Chad Gendason\n| length9          = 3:15\n\n| title10          = Open Eyes\n| extra10          = [[Debby Ryan]]\n| length10         = 4:06\n\n| title11          = Don't Wanna Grow Up\n| extra11          = Willknots\n| length11         = 3:53\n}}\n\n==Reception==\nThe movie garnered over 5.6 million viewers in its first showing.<ref>[http://tvbythenumbers.com/2010/06/28/friday-cable-ratings-16-wishes-premieres-big-party-down-gravity-finales-finish-small/55571 Friday Cable Ratings: 16 Wishes Premieres Big; Party Down, Gravity Finales Finish Small] Posted on 28 June 2010 by Bill Gorman - tvbythenumbers.com</ref> The film went on to become the most watched cable program on the day of its premiere on [[Disney Channel]].

In other countries, it is advertised as Disney Channel Original Movie.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} It was planned to have its UK premiere on November 19, 2010 on [[Disney Channel (UK & Ireland)|Disney Channel UK]], but was replaced with ''[[Starstruck (2010 film)|Starstruck]]'', which had already been shown in May; it was later shown in December 2010 in the UK.\n\n==Plot==\nAbby Jensen has been planning for her [[sweet sixteen (birthday)|sweet sixteen birthday]] since she was a little girl. She keeps a list of wishes that she wants to come true. When the big day finally arrives, she excitedly adds her sixteenth and final wish to the list: a photo of Logan, her crush. Her parents and her brother Mike surprise her, but she rejects them.\n\nThen begins the first of many unusual occurrences, each involving visits from a peculiar woman, Celeste. She first appears as an exterminator when the Jensens' house gets overrun by wasps from a nest that had been building up for 16 years. Celeste saves Abby's wish list, but the family is unable to go back inside their house until the wasps are exterminated.\n\nAbby's best friend, Jay Kepler, appears and offers Abby his jacket. When Abby reaches into a pocket, she finds a birthday present for her\u2014a necklace with a half of a heart saying \"BFF.\" Jay uses the other half as a charm on his key ring. A delivery truck pulls up, and Celeste comes out dressed as a mail woman and gives a package with 16 candles and a matchbox to Abby. Abby lights the first candle, her first wish, meeting celebrity Joey Lockhart, is fulfilled. Abby then realizes that the candles correspond to the wishes on her wish list. Abby lights up the eighth candle and her wish for a red car is fulfilled. Out of the car comes Celeste. Abby realizes Celeste is a magical being and her wishes come true each time a candle is lit, and Celeste appears whenever a wish is granted.\n\nAbby unsuccessfully tries to make a third wish. Celeste explains that Abby must wait to make new wishes within new hours, and that, at midnight, Abby's candles expire and the wishes she made will be permanent. Abby makes more wishes, causing her to beat her nemesis, Krista Cook, who has the same birthday as her, in a volleyball match, and become Student Body President.\n\nAbby remembers that she needs a dress for her birthday party and decides buy it with Jay, who agrees to pay for it. They are followed by Krista, who takes Jay's wallet when he drops it. She convinces the store clerk that the two are not actually going to buy anything; the clerk kicks them out. Abby uses the 9th candle to make a wish to be treated like an adult, which adds consequences of adulthood that she did not think of. Abby is suddenly not allowed to attend high school anymore, and no one at school remembers her, not even Jay. Her parents buy her a new apartment and leave her to live on her own.\n\nRegretting her wish, Abby unsuccessfully tries to make new wishes and change some. Abby makes a wish for her parents to understand her; her parents do understand her, but under the impression that she is an adult. Abby walks by Krista's Sweet 16 and spots Jay. She restores Jay's memories that they are best friends by showing him the necklace he gave her. However, Jay is unable to help her. Abby talks to Krista, and realizes that she is on good terms with her in adulthood. She also realizes that Jay wanted to be Student Body President all along.\n\nDesperate, Abby returns to her apartment where Celeste appears. Abby talks with Celeste as she tells her how selfish she was for thinking about herself over her friends and family due to not seeing what she already had. Abby eventually found a loophole through the rules of magic because her last wish was glued on with gum, acting as a \"barrier\" between the picture and the rules. She switches the picture for a picture of her taken that morning and wishes she could go back to that morning right before midnight strikes.\n\nAbby's life then goes back to normal. Abby throws her wish list away and gives her money to Mike for a guitar. Abby finds Krista carrying posters saying 'Vote For Krista.' She and Krista reconcile after Krista tells Abby that she dislikes her because she took Jay away from her as a friend. Abby and Krista stop competing and work together to make Jay Student Body President, fulfilling his dream. Abby and Krista have a joint birthday party. Krista and Logan become a couple, and Mike's talent is recognized. Abby tells Jay that she has no more wishes, and they kiss. Celeste then turns into a fairy and flies away. The couples\u2014Abby and Jay and Krista and Logan\u2014then dance together at the party.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Debby Ryan]] as Abigail \"Abby\" Louise Jensen\n* [[Jean-Luc Bilodeau]] as Jay Kepler\n* [[Anna Mae Routledge]] as Celeste\n* Karissa Tynes as Krista Cook\n* Keenan Tracey as Logan Buchanan\n* Joel Semande as Joey Lockhart\n* [[Cainan Wiebe]] as Mike Jensen\n* [[Patrick Gilmore (actor)|Patrick Gilmore]] as Bob Jensen\n* Kendall Cross  as Sue Jensen\n* [[Jesse Reid]] as Theodore Hope\n*Brenda Crichlow as Miss Duffy\n*Patricia Isaac as Snooty Sales Woman\n* [[Gary Jones (actor)|Gary Jones]] as Principal Smith\n* Kailey Cross as 8-year-old Abby\n}}\n\n==Production==\nSome scenes were filmed at [[Walnut Grove Secondary School]] in [[Langley, British Columbia (district municipality)|Langley, British Columbia]].\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = 16 Wishes\n| type       = [[Soundtrack]]\n| artist     = Various artists\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| caption    = {{deletable image-caption|Thursday, 20 September 2018|PROD}}\n| released   = June 15, 2010<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/16-wishes-soundtrack/id376436116|title=16 Wishes Soundtrack1|publisher=iTunes|accessdate=June 4, 2011}}</ref>\n| recorded   = 2010\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Soundtrack]]\n| length     = 28:32\n| label      = [[MarVista Entertainment]]\n| producer   = Various artists\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\n''16 Wishes'' is the soundtrack album for the film of the same name, released on June 15, 2010, by [[MarVista Entertainment]].\n\n===Track listing===\n{{Track listing\n| extra_column    = Performer(s)\n| total_length    = 28:32\n\n| title1           = A Wish Comes True Everyday\n| extra1           = [[Debby Ryan]]\n| length1          = 3:10\n\n| title2           = No One's Fool\n| extra2           = [[Keith Macpherson|Keith & Renee]]\n| length2          = 3:15\n\n| title3           = Princess Girl\n| extra3           = Minnutes\n| length3          = 3:21\n\n| title4           = Bad Momma\n| extra4           = Chad Gendason\n| length4          = 2:19\n\n| title5           = Saying Goodbye\n| extra5           = Chase Ryan\n| length5          = 2:44\n| note             = featuring Michaele Popp Aaron Harvey\n\n| title6           = Picture Perfect\n| extra6           = Jennifer Cathcart\n| length6          = 3:14\n\n| title7           = The Way It Used To Be\n| extra7           = [[Not by Choice]]\n| length7          = 4:05\n\n| title8           = Vertigo\n| extra8           = Willknots\n| length8          = 3:38\n\n| title9           = Overreaction\n| extra9           = Chad Gendason\n| length9          = 3:15\n\n| title10          = Open Eyes\n| extra10          = [[Debby Ryan]]\n| length10         = 4:06\n\n| title11          = Don't Wanna Grow Up\n| extra11          = Willknots\n| length11         = 3:53\n}}\n\n==Reception==\nThe movie garnered over 5.6 million viewers in its first showing.<ref>[http://tvbythenumbers.com/2010/06/28/friday-cable-ratings-16-wishes-premieres-big-party-down-gravity-finales-finish-small/55571 Friday Cable Ratings: 16 Wishes Premieres Big; Party Down, Gravity Finales Finish Small] Posted on 28 June 2010 by Bill Gorman - tvbythenumbers.com</ref> The film went on to become the most watched cable program on the day of its premiere on [[Disney Channel]].

He was the host of the weekly [[National Public Radio]] program ''[[From the Top]]''. O'Riley is also known for his piano [[arrangement (music)|arrangements]] of songs by [[Alternative music|alternative]] artists.<ref>{{cite web|last=O'Riley |first=Christopher |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5074636 |title=Christopher O'Riley |publisher=NPR |date=2005-12-29 |accessdate=2012-08-04}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nO'Riley was born in 1956 in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], United States, and grew up in [[Evanston, Illinois]]. He began classical piano studies at the age of 4, and became interested in pop music and started his own band in 6th grade. His dual-track musical interests led him to jazz-rock fusion and included a professional performance in his later high school years with the Pittsburgh alto sax player [[Eric Kloss]]. His choice of music school was fortuitous as the [[New England Conservatory|New England Conservatory of Music]] had as its president in the 1970s the composer/historian [[Gunther Schuller]]. It was upon entering NEC that O'Riley decided to pursue classical studies exclusively.<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=q43371|pure_url=yes}}|title=Biography: Christopher O'Riley|last=Brown|first=Marisa|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=3 May 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nIn 1981, he won the [[Young Concert Artists International Auditions]]. He has received awards at the [[Leeds International Pianoforte Competition|Leeds]], Van Cliburn, Busoni and Montreal competitions, as well as an Avery Fisher Career Grant. O'Riley has made many recordings of [[european classical music|classical music]]. His debut album, a collection of the works of [[Ferruccio Busoni]], including the seldom performed ''[[Fantasia Contrappuntistica]]'', was released in 1983. He has since released several recordings, including works of [[Maurice Ravel]], [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]], [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]], [[John Coolidge Adams|John Adams]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], and [[Alexander Scriabin]], as well as a recording of ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]'' with the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]].\n\nO'Riley is the former host of the weekly [[National Public Radio]] program ''[[From the Top]]'', on which young musicians are heard and interviewed. According to its website, it is the most popular weekly one-hour classical music show on the air today. O'Riley first began performing [[Radiohead]] songs as a time-filler during a break in the program, to supplement preludes and miniatures by composers such as [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]] and [[Sergei Rachmaninoff|Rachmaninoff]]. Many of those short classical pieces are found on his CD release ''At the Break''. Initially designed as a media platform for all manner of young musicians, From The Top soon became exclusively dedicated to Classical music, and it was in this atmosphere that O'Riley decided to augment the format by inserting, unannounced, his own arrangements, presumably Classical pieces, of Radiohead songs. When listeners were apprised of the title and provenance of the pieces, emails came into the show asking \"Who is this Mr. Head and where can I find more of his beautiful music?\"\n\n''[[True Love Waits (album)|True Love Waits: Christopher O'Riley Plays Radiohead]]'', his recording of his own piano arrangements of songs by the [[alternative rock]] band [[Radiohead]], was released in 2003. O'Riley's second Radiohead-derived album, ''[[Hold Me To This]]'', followed two years later and contains a different selection of songs. Both albums had moderate success on the classical [[crossover (music)|crossover]] charts. In 2006, he released a piano tribute to [[Elliott Smith]], ''Home to Oblivion'', again featuring his own arrangements.\n\nO'Riley says that his renditions have introduced the music of Radiohead to a classical audience as well as introducing classical music to a wider or younger audience, as he sometimes performs both standard concert repertoire, such as [[Dmitri Shostakovich|Shostakovich]] or [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], and Radiohead, Elliott Smith or [[Nick Drake]] interpretations at the same concert. O'Riley describes himself as an obsessed Radiohead fan in interviews, and says he was attracted to the multilayered nature of the band's music, leading him to listen to and transcribe lesser known album tracks, live [[bootleg recording]]s of performances, [[b-sides]], and even songs never officially released, as well as some of their hit singles. In his liner notes for ''Home to Oblivion'', he calls Elliott Smith \"the most important songwriter since [[Cole Porter]],\" although admitting he was unaware of Smith's music until his apparent suicide in 2003.

He was the host of the weekly [[National Public Radio]] program ''[[From the Top]]''. O'Riley is also known for his piano [[arrangement (music)|arrangements]] of songs by [[Alternative music|alternative]] artists.<ref>{{cite web|last=O'Riley |first=Christopher |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5074636 |title=Christopher O'Riley |publisher=NPR |date=2005-12-29 |accessdate=2012-08-04}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nO'Riley was born in 1956 in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], United States, and grew up in [[Evanston, Illinois]]. He began classical piano studies at the age of 4, and became interested in pop music and started his own band in 6th grade. His dual-track musical interests led him to jazz-rock fusion and included a professional performance in his later high school years with the Pittsburgh alto sax player [[Eric Kloss]]. His choice of music school was fortuitous as the [[New England Conservatory|New England Conservatory of Music]] had as its president in the 1970s the composer/historian [[Gunther Schuller]]. It was upon entering NEC that O'Riley decided to pursue classical studies exclusively.<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=q43371|pure_url=yes}}|title=Biography: Christopher O'Riley|last=Brown|first=Marisa|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=3 May 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nIn 1981, he won the [[Young Concert Artists International Auditions]]. He has received awards at the [[Leeds International Pianoforte Competition|Leeds]], Van Cliburn, Busoni and Montreal competitions, as well as an Avery Fisher Career Grant. O'Riley has made many recordings of [[european classical music|classical music]]. His debut album, a collection of the works of [[Ferruccio Busoni]], including the seldom performed ''[[Fantasia Contrappuntistica]]'', was released in 1983. He has since released several recordings, including works of [[Maurice Ravel]], [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]], [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]], [[John Coolidge Adams|John Adams]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], and [[Alexander Scriabin]], as well as a recording of ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]'' with the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]].\n\nO'Riley is the former host of the weekly [[National Public Radio]] program ''[[From the Top]]'', on which young musicians are heard and interviewed. According to its website, it is the most popular weekly one-hour classical music show on the air today. O'Riley first began performing [[Radiohead]] songs as a time-filler during a break in the program, to supplement preludes and miniatures by composers such as [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]] and [[Sergei Rachmaninoff|Rachmaninoff]]. Many of those short classical pieces are found on his CD release ''At the Break''. Initially designed as a media platform for all manner of young musicians, From The Top soon became exclusively dedicated to Classical music, and it was in this atmosphere that O'Riley decided to augment the format by inserting, unannounced, his own arrangements, presumably Classical pieces, of Radiohead songs. When listeners were apprised of the title and provenance of the pieces, emails came into the show asking \"Who is this Mr. Head and where can I find more of his beautiful music?\"\n\n''[[True Love Waits (album)|True Love Waits: Christopher O'Riley Plays Radiohead]]'', his recording of his own piano arrangements of songs by the [[alternative rock]] band [[Radiohead]], was released in 2003. O'Riley's second Radiohead-derived album, ''[[Hold Me To This]]'', followed two years later and contains a different selection of songs. Both albums had moderate success on the classical [[crossover (music)|crossover]] charts. In 2006, he released a piano tribute to [[Elliott Smith]], ''Home to Oblivion'', again featuring his own arrangements.\n\nO'Riley says that his renditions have introduced the music of Radiohead to a classical audience as well as introducing classical music to a wider or younger audience, as he sometimes performs both standard concert repertoire, such as [[Dmitri Shostakovich|Shostakovich]] or [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], and Radiohead, Elliott Smith or [[Nick Drake]] interpretations at the same concert. O'Riley describes himself as an obsessed Radiohead fan in interviews, and says he was attracted to the multilayered nature of the band's music, leading him to listen to and transcribe lesser known album tracks, live [[bootleg recording]]s of performances, [[b-sides]], and even songs never officially released, as well as some of their hit singles. In his liner notes for ''Home to Oblivion'', he calls Elliott Smith \"the most important songwriter since [[Cole Porter]],\" although admitting he was unaware of Smith's music until his apparent suicide in 2003. When asked to explain his unusual choice of material for a classical pianist, O'Riley has often quoted [[Duke Ellington]]'s statement that \"there are two kinds of music. Good music, and the other kind.\"\n\nO'Riley's work has often been distinguished from other classical rock-tribute albums by music critics, who note O'Riley's quality of playing. ''True Love Waits'' received 4 out of 5 stars from [[Rolling Stone]] magazine, allegedly the only \"classical\" recording to do so, while his Radiohead concert programs have received generally favorable notices from classical critics and promotion on NPR's ''Performance Today''.\n\n==Personal life==\nO'Riley currently resides in Los Angeles, California.

While the industry's average selling price to individuals was going down, Dell's was going up, as second- and third-time computer buyers who wanted powerful computers with multiple features and did not need much technical support were choosing Dell. Dell found an opportunity among PC-savvy individuals who liked the convenience of buying direct, customizing their PC to their means, and having it delivered in days.

The major three providers of servers at the time were IBM, Hewlett Packard, and Compaq, many of which were based on proprietary technology, such as IBM's Power4 microprocessors or various proprietary versions of the Unix operating system. Dell's new PowerEdge servers did not require a major investment in proprietary technologies, as they ran [[Microsoft Windows NT]] on Intel chips, and could be built cheaper than its competitors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mhhe.com/business/management/updates/thompson12e/case/dell8.html |title=Dell Computer Corporation Online Case |publisher=Mhhe.com |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}</ref> Consequently, Dell's enterprise revenues, almost nonexistent in 1994, accounted for 13 percent of the company's total intake by 1998.

U.S. shipments of desktop PCs were shrinking, and the corporate PC market which purchases PCs in upgrade cycles had largely decided to take a break from buying new systems.

Dell stopped this practice in 1994, citing low profit margins on the business, exclusively distributing through a direct-sales model for the next decade. In 2003, Dell briefly sold products in [[Sears]] stores in the U.S. In 2007, Dell started shipping its products to major retailers in the U.S. once again, starting with [[Sam's Club]] and [[Walmart|Wal-Mart]]. [[Staples Inc.|Staples]], the largest office-supply retailer in the U.S., and [[Best Buy]], the largest electronics retailer in the U.S., became Dell retail partners later that same year.\n\n=====Kiosks=====\nStarting in 2002, Dell opened [[kiosk]] locations in the United States to allow customers to examine products before buying them directly from the company.

In April 2007, Dell opened a retail store in [[Budapest]]. In October of the same year, Dell opened a retail store in Moscow.\n\nIn the UK, [[HMV]]'s flagship [[Trocadero (London)|Trocadero]] store has sold Dell XPS PCs since December 2007. From January 2008 the UK stores of [[DSG International (retailer)|DSGi]] have sold Dell products (in particular, through [[Currys]] and [[PC World (retailer)|PC World]] stores). As of 2008, the large supermarket-chain [[Tesco]] has sold Dell laptops and desktops in outlets throughout the UK.\n\nIn May 2008, Dell reached an agreement with office supply chain, [[Officeworks]] (part of [[Coles Group]]), to stock a few modified models in the Inspiron desktop and notebook range. These models have slightly different model numbers, but almost replicate the ones available from the Dell Store. Dell continued its retail push in the Australian market with its partnership with Harris Technology (another part of Coles Group) in November of the same year. In addition, Dell expanded its retail distributions in Australia through an agreement with the discount electrical retailer, [[The Good Guys (Australasia)|The Good Guys]], known for \"Slashing Prices\". Dell agreed to distribute a variety of makes of both desktops and notebooks, including [[Studio]] and [[Dell XPS|XPS]] systems in late 2008. Dell and [[Dick Smith Electronics]] (owned by [[Woolworths Limited]]) reached an agreement to expand within Dick Smith's 400 stores throughout Australia and New Zealand in May 2009 (1 year since Officeworks\u2014owned by Coles Group\u2014reached a deal). The retailer has agreed to distribute a variety of [[Inspiron]] and [[Studio]] notebooks, with minimal Studio desktops from the Dell range. {{As of|2009}}, Dell continues to run and operate its various kiosks in 18 shopping centres throughout Australia.

The major three providers of servers at the time were IBM, Hewlett Packard, and Compaq, many of which were based on proprietary technology, such as IBM's Power4 microprocessors or various proprietary versions of the Unix operating system.

On January 30, 2008, Dell announced it would shut down all 140 kiosks in the U.S. due to expansion into retail stores.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.dell.com/us/en/corp/d/press-releases/2008-01-30-00-direct-retail.aspx |title=Dell Focuses on Direct and Retail Business, Closes Kiosks in U.S |publisher=Content.dell.com |date=January 30, 2008 |accessdate=November 17, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113024054/http://content.dell.com/us/en/corp/d/press-releases/2008-01-30-00-direct-retail.aspx |archivedate=November 13, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nBy June 3, 2010, Dell had also shut down all of its mall kiosks in Australia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2010/04/dell-closing-down-their-retail-kiosks-across-the-country/|title=Dell Closing Down Their Retail Kiosks Across The Country  |publisher=gizmodo.com |date=April 1, 2010 |accessdate=November 18, 2011}}</ref>\n\n====Retail stores====\n{{As of|2008|2|alt=As of the end of February 2008}}, Dell products shipped to one of the largest office-supply retailers in Canada, [[Staples Business Depot]]. In April 2008, [[Future Shop]] and [[Best Buy]] began carrying a subset of Dell products, such as certain desktops, laptops, printers, and monitors.\n\nSince some shoppers in certain markets show reluctance to purchase technological products through the phone or the Internet, Dell has looked into opening retail operations in some countries in Central Europe and Russia. In April 2007, Dell opened a retail store in [[Budapest]]. In October of the same year, Dell opened a retail store in Moscow.\n\nIn the UK, [[HMV]]'s flagship [[Trocadero (London)|Trocadero]] store has sold Dell XPS PCs since December 2007. From January 2008 the UK stores of [[DSG International (retailer)|DSGi]] have sold Dell products (in particular, through [[Currys]] and [[PC World (retailer)|PC World]] stores). As of 2008, the large supermarket-chain [[Tesco]] has sold Dell laptops and desktops in outlets throughout the UK.\n\nIn May 2008, Dell reached an agreement with office supply chain, [[Officeworks]] (part of [[Coles Group]]), to stock a few modified models in the Inspiron desktop and notebook range. These models have slightly different model numbers, but almost replicate the ones available from the Dell Store. Dell continued its retail push in the Australian market with its partnership with Harris Technology (another part of Coles Group) in November of the same year. In addition, Dell expanded its retail distributions in Australia through an agreement with the discount electrical retailer, [[The Good Guys (Australasia)|The Good Guys]], known for \"Slashing Prices\". Dell agreed to distribute a variety of makes of both desktops and notebooks, including [[Studio]] and [[Dell XPS|XPS]] systems in late 2008. Dell and [[Dick Smith Electronics]] (owned by [[Woolworths Limited]]) reached an agreement to expand within Dick Smith's 400 stores throughout Australia and New Zealand in May 2009 (1 year since Officeworks\u2014owned by Coles Group\u2014reached a deal). The retailer has agreed to distribute a variety of [[Inspiron]] and [[Studio]] notebooks, with minimal Studio desktops from the Dell range. {{As of|2009}}, Dell continues to run and operate its various kiosks in 18 shopping centres throughout Australia. On March 31, 2010, Dell announced to Australian Kiosk employees that they were shutting down the Australian/New Zealand Dell kiosk program.\n\nIn Germany, Dell is selling selected smartphones and notebooks via [[Media Markt]] and Saturn, as well as some shopping websites.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.netzwelt.de/news/87864-discounter-check-dell-venue-pro-media-markt.html |title=Dell Venue Pro offered by Media Markt |publisher=Netzwelt.de |date=February 22, 1999 |accessdate=November 17, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Competition===\nDell's major competitors include [[Hewlett-Packard Company|Hewlett-Packard]] (HP), [[Hasee]], [[Acer Inc.|Acer]], [[Fujitsu]], [[Toshiba]], [[Gateway, Inc.|Gateway]], [[Sony]], [[Asus]], [[Lenovo Group|Lenovo]], [[IBM]], [[Micro-Star International|MSI]], [[Panasonic]], [[Samsung]] and Apple.

IDC's Q4 2006 estimates show Dell's share of the server market at 8.1%, down from 9.5% in the previous year. This represents an 8.8% loss year-over-year, primarily to competitors [[EMC Corporation|EMC]] and IBM.\n\n===Partnership with EMC===\nIn 2001, Dell and EMC entered into a partnership whereby both companies jointly design products and Dell provided support for certain EMC products including midrange storage systems, such as [[fibre channel]] and [[iSCSI]] [[storage area network]]s. The relationship also promotes and sells OEM versions of backup, recovery, replication and archiving software.<ref>{{cite press release | url=https://www.emc.com/about/news/press/us/2001/20011022-1125.htm | title=Dell, EMC Sign Multi-Billion-Dollar Enterprise Storage Agreement | publisher=[[Dell EMC]] | date=October 22, 2001}}</ref> On December 9, 2008, Dell and EMC announced the multi-year extension, through 2013, of the strategic partnership with EMC.

While motherboard power connections reverted to the industry standard in 2003, Dell remains secretive about their motherboard pin-outs for peripherals (such as MMC readers and power on/off switches and LEDs).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=339053 |title=Dell proprietary (non-standard) ATX design > Dell proprietary (non-standard) ATX design |publisher=InformIT |accessdate=November 17, 2011}}</ref><ref>Mueller, Scott (2002).

A 2013 review recommends that only in the very rare instances where a shark clearly predated on a human should the bite incident be termed an \"attack,\" which implies predation, and that otherwise it is more accurate to class bite incidents as \"sighting\", \"encounter\", \"bite incident\", or \"fatal bite incident\". Sightings do not include physical interaction, encounters include physical interaction without harm, shark bites include minor and major shark bite incidents, including those that do and do not require medical attention, and fatal shark bite incidents are those that result in death. The study suggests that only in a case where an expert validates the predatory intent of a shark would it be appropriate to term a bite incident an attack.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Neff|first=Christopher|last2=Hueter|first2=Robert|date=23 January 2013|title=Science, policy, and the public discourse of shark \"attack\": a proposal for reclassifying human\u2013shark interactions|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235930824|journal=Journal of Environmental Studies and Sciences|language=en|volume=3|issue=1|pages=65\u201373|doi=10.1007/s13412-013-0107-2|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n== Statistics ==\n[[File:Total shark attacks per year, OWID.svg|thumb|upright=2|Total shark attacks per year, 1749 to 2018<ref>{{cite web |title=Total shark attacks per year |url=https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/total-shark-attacks-per-year |website=Our World in Data}}</ref>]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:auto; float:right; clear:right; margin:0 0 0.5em 1em; text-align:right; font-size: 85%;\"\n|-\n|+ style=\"background:#66a; color:#fff;\" colspan=\"4\"| Confirmed unprovoked shark attacks, 1958\u20132018\n|-\n!

The increased use of technology has enabled Australia and the United States to record more data than other nations, which could somewhat bias the results recorded. In addition to this, individuals and institutions in South Africa, the US and Australia keep a file which is regularly updated by an entire research team, the International Shark Attack File, and the Australian Shark Attack File.\n\nThe [[Florida Museum of Natural History]] compares these statistics with the much higher rate of deaths from other causes. For example, an average of more than 38 people die annually from [[lightning]] strikes in coastal states, while less than 1 person per year is killed by a shark in Florida.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/sharks/attacks/relarisk.htm |title=The Relative Risk of Shark Attacks to Humans |publisher=Flmnh.ufl.edu |accessdate=23 September 2010}}</ref><ref>Florida Museum of Natural History, University of Florida.

For example, in the southwest of [[West Australia]] the chances of a surfer suffering a fatal shark bite in winter or spring are 1 in 40,000 and for divers it is 1 in 16,000.<ref name=\"Spri\" /><ref name=\"whalemig\" /> In comparison to the risk of a serious or fatal cycling accident, this represents 3 times the risk for a surfer and 7 times the risk for a diver.<ref name=\"Spri\" />\n\n== Species involved in incidents ==\n[[File:Snorkeler with blacktip reef shark.jpg|thumb|300px|left|A [[blacktip reef shark]].

It is possible that the sharks are able to sense the presence of unnatural elements on or about the divers, such as polyurethane diving suits and air tanks, which may lead them to accept temporary outsiders as more of a curiosity than prey. Uncostumed humans, however, such as those surfboarding, light snorkeling or swimming, present a much greater area of exposed skin surface to sharks. In addition, the presence of even small traces of blood, recent minor abrasions, cuts, scrapes or bruises, may lead sharks to attack a human in their environment. Sharks seek out prey through [[electroreception]], sensing the electric fields that are generated by all animals due to the activity of their nerves and muscles.\n\nMost of the oceanic whitetip shark's attacks have not been recorded,<ref name=\"howstuffdangerous4\"/> unlike the other three species mentioned above. Famed oceanographic researcher [[Jacques Cousteau]] described the oceanic whitetip as \"the most dangerous of all sharks\".<ref>{{cite book|author1=Cousteau, Jacques-Yves  |author2=Cousteau, Philippe |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Shark: Splendid Savage of the Sea|publisher= Doubleday & Company, Inc|year=1970}}</ref> [[File:Watsonandtheshark-original.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Watson and the Shark]]'' by [[John Singleton Copley|J.S. Copley]], based on the attack on [[Brook Watson]] in [[Havana Harbor]] in 1749]]Modern-day statistics show the oceanic whitetip shark as seldom being involved in unprovoked attacks. However, there have been a number of attacks involving this species, particularly during [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. The oceanic whitetip lives in the open sea and rarely shows up near coasts, where most recorded incidents occur. During the world wars, many ship and aircraft disasters happened in the open ocean, and because of its former abundance, the oceanic whitetip was often the first species on site when such a disaster happened.\n\nInfamous examples of oceanic whitetip attacks include the sinking of the [[RMS Nova Scotia (1926)|''Nova Scotia'']], a British steamship carrying 1,000 people that was torpedoed by a [[German submarine]] on 18 November 1942, near [[South Africa]]. Only 192 people survived, with many deaths attributed to the oceanic whitetip shark.<ref>Bass, A.J., J.D. D'Aubrey & N. Kistnasamy. 1973. \"Sharks of the east coast of southern Africa. 1.

Incidents that occur outside of a shark's natural habitat, such as aquariums and research holding-pens, are considered provoked, as are all incidents involving captured sharks. Sometimes humans inadvertently provoke an attack, such as when a surfer accidentally hits a shark with a surf board.\n\n=== Unprovoked attack ===\nUnprovoked attacks are initiated by the shark\u2014they occur in a shark's natural habitat on a live human and without human provocation.<ref name=\"ISAF-2011Summary\"/><ref name=\"GSAF-IL\"/> There are three subcategories of unprovoked attack:\n* Hit-and-run attack \u2013 usually non-fatal, the shark bites and then leaves; most victims do not see the shark. This is the most common type of attack and typically occurs in the surf zone or in murky water. Most hit-and-run attacks are believed to be the result of mistaken identity.<ref name=\"ISAF-HWW\">{{cite web |url=http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/sharks/attacks/howwhen.htm |title=How, When, & Where Sharks Attack |author=Burgess, George H. |authorlink=George H. Burgess |publisher=International Shark Attack File |accessdate=26 June 2012}}</ref>\n* Sneak attack \u2013 the victim will not usually see the shark, and may sustain multiple deep bites. This kind of attack is predatory in nature and is often carried out with the intention of consuming the victim. It is extraordinarily rare for this to occur.\n* Bump-and-bite attack \u2013 the shark circles and bumps the victim before biting. Great whites are known to do this on occasion, referred to as a \"test bite\", in which the great white is attempting to identify what is being bitten. Repeated bites, depending on the reaction of the victim (thrashing or panicking may lead the shark to believe the victim is prey), are not uncommon and can be severe or fatal. Bump-and-bite attacks are not believed to be the result of mistaken identity.<ref name=\"ISAF-HWW\"/>\n\nAn incident occurred in 2011 when a 3-meter long great white shark jumped onto a 7-person [[research vessel]] off [[Seal Island, South Africa]]. The crew were undertaking a [[animal population study|population study]] using sardines as bait, and the incident was judged to be an accident.<ref>{{cite news | first = Xan | last = Rice | title = Great white shark jumps from sea into research boat | date = 19 July 2011 | publisher = [[Guardian Media Group]] | url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/19/great-white-shark-jumps-boat | work = [[The Guardian]] | accessdate = 20 July 2011 | quote = Marine researchers in South Africa had a narrow escape after a three-metre-long great white shark breached the surface of the sea and leaped into their boat, becoming trapped on deck for more than an hour.

A 2013 review recommends that only in the very rare instances where a shark clearly predated on a human should the bite incident be termed an \"attack,\" which implies predation, and that otherwise it is more accurate to class bite incidents as \"sighting\", \"encounter\", \"bite incident\", or \"fatal bite incident\". Sightings do not include physical interaction, encounters include physical interaction without harm, shark bites include minor and major shark bite incidents, including those that do and do not require medical attention, and fatal shark bite incidents are those that result in death. The study suggests that only in a case where an expert validates the predatory intent of a shark would it be appropriate to term a bite incident an attack.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Neff|first=Christopher|last2=Hueter|first2=Robert|date=23 January 2013|title=Science, policy, and the public discourse of shark \"attack\": a proposal for reclassifying human\u2013shark interactions|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235930824|journal=Journal of Environmental Studies and Sciences|language=en|volume=3|issue=1|pages=65\u201373|doi=10.1007/s13412-013-0107-2|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n== Statistics ==\n[[File:Total shark attacks per year, OWID.svg|thumb|upright=2|Total shark attacks per year, 1749 to 2018<ref>{{cite web |title=Total shark attacks per year |url=https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/total-shark-attacks-per-year |website=Our World in Data}}</ref>]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:auto; float:right; clear:right; margin:0 0 0.5em 1em; text-align:right; font-size: 85%;\"\n|-\n|+ style=\"background:#66a; color:#fff;\" colspan=\"4\"| Confirmed unprovoked shark attacks, 1958\u20132018\n|-\n!

For example, an average of more than 38 people die annually from [[lightning]] strikes in coastal states, while less than 1 person per year is killed by a shark in Florida.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/sharks/attacks/relarisk.htm |title=The Relative Risk of Shark Attacks to Humans |publisher=Flmnh.ufl.edu |accessdate=23 September 2010}}</ref><ref>Florida Museum of Natural History, University of Florida.

Uncostumed humans, however, such as those surfboarding, light snorkeling or swimming, present a much greater area of exposed skin surface to sharks. In addition, the presence of even small traces of blood, recent minor abrasions, cuts, scrapes or bruises, may lead sharks to attack a human in their environment. Sharks seek out prey through [[electroreception]], sensing the electric fields that are generated by all animals due to the activity of their nerves and muscles.\n\nMost of the oceanic whitetip shark's attacks have not been recorded,<ref name=\"howstuffdangerous4\"/> unlike the other three species mentioned above. Famed oceanographic researcher [[Jacques Cousteau]] described the oceanic whitetip as \"the most dangerous of all sharks\".<ref>{{cite book|author1=Cousteau, Jacques-Yves  |author2=Cousteau, Philippe |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Shark: Splendid Savage of the Sea|publisher= Doubleday & Company, Inc|year=1970}}</ref> [[File:Watsonandtheshark-original.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Watson and the Shark]]'' by [[John Singleton Copley|J.S.

However, there have been a number of attacks involving this species, particularly during [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. The oceanic whitetip lives in the open sea and rarely shows up near coasts, where most recorded incidents occur. During the world wars, many ship and aircraft disasters happened in the open ocean, and because of its former abundance, the oceanic whitetip was often the first species on site when such a disaster happened.\n\nInfamous examples of oceanic whitetip attacks include the sinking of the [[RMS Nova Scotia (1926)|''Nova Scotia'']], a British steamship carrying 1,000 people that was torpedoed by a [[German submarine]] on 18 November 1942, near [[South Africa]]. Only 192 people survived, with many deaths attributed to the oceanic whitetip shark.<ref>Bass, A.J., J.D. D'Aubrey & N. Kistnasamy. 1973. \"Sharks of the east coast of southern Africa. 1.

Incidents that occur outside of a shark's natural habitat, such as aquariums and research holding-pens, are considered provoked, as are all incidents involving captured sharks. Sometimes humans inadvertently provoke an attack, such as when a surfer accidentally hits a shark with a surf board.\n\n=== Unprovoked attack ===\nUnprovoked attacks are initiated by the shark\u2014they occur in a shark's natural habitat on a live human and without human provocation.<ref name=\"ISAF-2011Summary\"/><ref name=\"GSAF-IL\"/> There are three subcategories of unprovoked attack:\n* Hit-and-run attack \u2013 usually non-fatal, the shark bites and then leaves; most victims do not see the shark. This is the most common type of attack and typically occurs in the surf zone or in murky water. Most hit-and-run attacks are believed to be the result of mistaken identity.<ref name=\"ISAF-HWW\">{{cite web |url=http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/sharks/attacks/howwhen.htm |title=How, When, & Where Sharks Attack |author=Burgess, George H. |authorlink=George H.

This kind of attack is predatory in nature and is often carried out with the intention of consuming the victim. It is extraordinarily rare for this to occur.\n* Bump-and-bite attack \u2013 the shark circles and bumps the victim before biting. Great whites are known to do this on occasion, referred to as a \"test bite\", in which the great white is attempting to identify what is being bitten. Repeated bites, depending on the reaction of the victim (thrashing or panicking may lead the shark to believe the victim is prey), are not uncommon and can be severe or fatal. Bump-and-bite attacks are not believed to be the result of mistaken identity.<ref name=\"ISAF-HWW\"/>\n\nAn incident occurred in 2011 when a 3-meter long great white shark jumped onto a 7-person [[research vessel]] off [[Seal Island, South Africa]]. The crew were undertaking a [[animal population study|population study]] using sardines as bait, and the incident was judged to be an accident.<ref>{{cite news | first = Xan | last = Rice | title = Great white shark jumps from sea into research boat | date = 19 July 2011 | publisher = [[Guardian Media Group]] | url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/19/great-white-shark-jumps-boat | work = [[The Guardian]] | accessdate = 20 July 2011 | quote = Marine researchers in South Africa had a narrow escape after a three-metre-long great white shark breached the surface of the sea and leaped into their boat, becoming trapped on deck for more than an hour.

{"title_page": "List of Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monuments in South Los Angeles", "text_new": "This is a '''list of [[Los Angeles]] Historic-Cultural Monuments in South Los Angeles''', California. In total, there are over 144 [[Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument|Historic-Cultural Monument]]s (HCM) in the [[South Los Angeles]] region, which includes the historic [[West Adams, Los Angeles, California|West Adams]], [[Exposition Park (Los Angeles)|Exposition Park]], and [[University of Southern California]] campus areas.  It also includes historic sites in [[Watts, Los Angeles, California|Watts]] (including Simon Rodia's [[Watts Towers]]), [[Baldwin Hills, Los Angeles, California|Baldwin Hills]], [[Crenshaw, Los Angeles, California|Crenshaw]], [[Jefferson Park, Los Angeles, California|Jefferson Park]], and [[Leimert Park, Los Angeles, California|Leimert Park]].  Further, certain historic sites in [[Arlington Heights, Los Angeles, California|Arlington Heights]], [[Harvard Heights, Los Angeles, California|Harvard Heights]] and [[Mid-City, Los Angeles, California|Mid-City]] neighborhoods below Washington Boulevard are identified by the Los Angeles Department of City Planning as being in South Los Angeles, and are included here.<ref>The Los Angeles Department of City Planning also identifies [[Rocha House]], [[Paul R. Williams House]], and [[Gerry Building]], as being in South Los Angeles, but those appear to be in [[South Robertson, Los Angeles, California|South Robertson]], [[Mar Vista, Los Angeles, California|Mar Vista]], [[Downtown Los Angeles]], and  neighborhoods, outside of what most would agree is the South Los Angeles area.</ref> They are designated by the City's Cultural Heritage Commission.  There is also a separate list below identifying other historic sites in the area that have not been designated as HCMs, but which have been recognized as [[California Historical Landmarks]] or have been listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].\n\n{{GeoGroupTemplate}}\n\n==Overview of the Historic-Cultural Monuments in southern Los Angeles==\n[[Image:USC Community House.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Forthmann House is one of the well-preserved Victorian homes in West Adams]]\n'''National Historic Landmarks'''.  The southern portion of Los Angeles includes some of the city's most historic sites, including three [[National Historic Landmark]]s.  The sites receiving this high designation are: (1) the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]], built in 1923, and used as the principal site of the 1932 and 1984 Summer Olympic Games;<ref>{{cite web|title=Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum |publisher=National Park Service |url=http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=1884&ResourceType=Structure |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114222329/http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=1884&ResourceType=Structure |archive-date=2007-11-14 |df= }}</ref> (2) the [[Watts Towers]] (HCM #15), a collection of 17 interconnected structures, two of which reach heights of over 99 feet (30 m), built by Italian immigrant construction worker [[Simon Rodia]] in his spare time from 1921 to 1954; and (3) [[Baldwin Hills Village]] (HCM #174), an innovative planned community built in the 1930s with large open grassy areas and trees.\n\n'''Historic West Adams'''.  The largest concentration of historic sites in the South Los Angeles region is in the [[West Adams, Los Angeles, California|West Adams]] district, along a three-mile stretch of West Adams Boulevard between Arlington Avenue and Figueroa Street.  Though South Los Angeles was once considered one of the poorest sections of the city, the West Adams district was one of the city's most affluent areas from the 1890s through the 1920s.  Many of the area's mansions, Victorian homes, and [[American Craftsman]] bungalows have been preserved.  The area's 70 Historic-Cultural Monuments include some of the city's most renowned landmarks, such as oil baron [[Edward Doheny]]'s [[Oliver G. Posey-Edward L. Doheny Residence|Chester Place mansion]] (HCM #30), the [[William Andrews Clark Memorial Library]] (HCM #28) operated by [[UCLA]], the castle-like [[Stimson House]] (HCM #212) that survived a dynamite attack in 1896, [[Frederick Hastings Rindge House]] (HCM #95) built by a Bostonian who owned all of Malibu, the picturesque Victorian [[Forthmann House]] (HCM #103), and the birthplace of two-time U.S. Presidential candidate [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] (HCM #35).\n\n'''Churches'''.  Many of the city's most recognizable churches are also located in southern Los Angeles, including the domed [[Second Church of Christ, Scientist (Los Angeles, California)|Second Church of Christ Scientist]] (HCM #57), the second Catholic church in the city to be consecrated, [[St. Vincent de Paul Church (Los Angeles, California)|St. Vincent de Paul]] (HCM #72), the city's Episcopal cathedral, [[St. John's Cathedral, Los Angeles|Saint John's]], its Greek Orthodox cathedral, [[Saint Sophia (Los Angeles)|Saint Sophia]] (HCM #120), the Gothic [[McCarty Memorial Christian Church]], which became one of the first white Protestant churches to be racially integrated in the 1950s, the Lombard Romanesque [[Second Baptist Church (Los Angeles, California)|Second Baptist Church]] (HCM #200) designed in 1925 by noted African-American architect, [[Paul Williams (architect)|Paul R. Williams]], and the Richardsonian Romanesque [[First African Methodist Episcopal Zion Cathedral & Community Center|First African Methodist Episcopal Zion Cathedral]] (HCM #341).\n\n'''USC and Exposition Park'''.  To the south of West Adams is the campus of the [[University of Southern California]] and [[Exposition Park (Los Angeles)|Exposition Park]].  The important sites in these neighborhoods include the L.A. Coliseum, the [[Shrine Auditorium]] (HCM #139) (the site of eleven Academy Awards ceremonies between 1947 and 2001),<ref>{{cite web|title=Locations of the Academy Awards Ceremonies|publisher=LA Almanac|url=http://www.laalmanac.com/arts/ar20a.htm}}</ref> the [[Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County]], the [[Exposition Park Rose Garden]], and USC's [[Widney Hall]] (HCM #70) (the oldest university building in Southern California, in continuous use since 1880).\n[[Image:Somerville Hotel, Los Angeles.JPG|thumb|175px|right|The Dunbar Hotel was at the center of the Central Avenue jazz scene in the 1930s and 1940s.]]\n\n'''African-American Music History'''.  The area also includes sites that have played an important role in the city's musical history.  The Ray Charles Worldwide Offices and Studios were designated as a Historic-Cultural Monument (HCM #776) in 2004, and the [[Dunbar Hotel]] (HCM #70) was at the center of the thriving [[Central Avenue (Los Angeles)|Central Avenue]] jazz scene in the 1930s and 1940s.  After hosting the first national convention of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]] to be held in the western United States, the Dunbar hosted [[Duke Ellington]], [[Cab Calloway]], [[Billie Holiday]], [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Lionel Hampton]], [[Count Basie]], [[Lena Horne]] and other jazz legends. Former heavyweight champion [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]] also ran a nightclub at the Dunbar in the 1930s.  And the Lincoln Theatre (HCM #744), built in 1927, was once the crown jewel of Central Avenue, referred to by some as the West Coast's version of [[New York City]]'s [[Apollo Theater]].\n\n'''Ralph J. Bunche House'''.  The [[Ralph J. Bunche House]] (HCM #159), boyhood home of [[Ralph J. Bunche]], the first African-American to win the [[Nobel Peace Prize]], has been preserved as a museum.\n\n'''Vermont Square Branch Library'''.  The city's oldest library building, the [[Vermont Square Branch]] (HCM #264) was built in 1913 in the [[Vermont Square, Los Angeles, California|Vermont Square]] neighborhood  of South Los Angeles.  It is an Italian Renaissance style building with Prairie style proportions built with a grant from [[Andrew Carnegie]].\n\n'''Watts Station'''.  The [[Watts Station]] was designated as a Historic-Cultural Monument (HCM #36) shortly after the [[Watts Riots]] in 1965.  The old wooden railway station, built in 1904, was the only building along Watts' main thoroughfare (which became known as \"Charcoal Alley\") to survive the riots.  The station became a symbol of continuity, hope and renewal for the Watts community.\n\n==Current and former Historic-Cultural Monuments==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:98%\"\n! {{LAHCM style}} width=1% | '''HCM #'''<ref>Numbers in 1-999 series are L.A.

The sites receiving this high designation are: (1) the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]], built in 1923, and used as the principal site of the 1932 and 1984 Summer Olympic Games;<ref>{{cite web|title=Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum |publisher=National Park Service |url=http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=1884&ResourceType=Structure |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114222329/http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=1884&ResourceType=Structure |archive-date=2007-11-14 |df= }}</ref> (2) the [[Watts Towers]] (HCM #15), a collection of 17 interconnected structures, two of which reach heights of over 99 feet (30 m), built by Italian immigrant construction worker [[Simon Rodia]] in his spare time from 1921 to 1954; and (3) [[Baldwin Hills Village]] (HCM #174), an innovative planned community built in the 1930s with large open grassy areas and trees.\n\n'''Historic West Adams'''.  The largest concentration of historic sites in the South Los Angeles region is in the [[West Adams, Los Angeles, California|West Adams]] district, along a three-mile stretch of West Adams Boulevard between Arlington Avenue and Figueroa Street.  Though South Los Angeles was once considered one of the poorest sections of the city, the West Adams district was one of the city's most affluent areas from the 1890s through the 1920s.  Many of the area's mansions, Victorian homes, and [[American Craftsman]] bungalows have been preserved.  The area's 70 Historic-Cultural Monuments include some of the city's most renowned landmarks, such as oil baron [[Edward Doheny]]'s [[Oliver G. Posey-Edward L. Doheny Residence|Chester Place mansion]] (HCM #30), the [[William Andrews Clark Memorial Library]] (HCM #28) operated by [[UCLA]], the castle-like [[Stimson House]] (HCM #212) that survived a dynamite attack in 1896, [[Frederick Hastings Rindge House]] (HCM #95) built by a Bostonian who owned all of Malibu, the picturesque Victorian [[Forthmann House]] (HCM #103), and the birthplace of two-time U.S. Presidential candidate [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] (HCM #35).\n\n'''Churches'''.  Many of the city's most recognizable churches are also located in southern Los Angeles, including the domed [[Second Church of Christ, Scientist (Los Angeles, California)|Second Church of Christ Scientist]] (HCM #57), the second Catholic church in the city to be consecrated, [[St. Vincent de Paul Church (Los Angeles, California)|St. Vincent de Paul]] (HCM #72), the city's Episcopal cathedral, [[St. John's Cathedral, Los Angeles|Saint John's]], its Greek Orthodox cathedral, [[Saint Sophia (Los Angeles)|Saint Sophia]] (HCM #120), the Gothic [[McCarty Memorial Christian Church]], which became one of the first white Protestant churches to be racially integrated in the 1950s, the Lombard Romanesque [[Second Baptist Church (Los Angeles, California)|Second Baptist Church]] (HCM #200) designed in 1925 by noted African-American architect, [[Paul Williams (architect)|Paul R. Williams]], and the Richardsonian Romanesque [[First African Methodist Episcopal Zion Cathedral & Community Center|First African Methodist Episcopal Zion Cathedral]] (HCM #341).\n\n'''USC and Exposition Park'''.  To the south of West Adams is the campus of the [[University of Southern California]] and [[Exposition Park (Los Angeles)|Exposition Park]].  The important sites in these neighborhoods include the L.A. Coliseum, the [[Shrine Auditorium]] (HCM #139) (the site of eleven Academy Awards ceremonies between 1947 and 2001),<ref>{{cite web|title=Locations of the Academy Awards Ceremonies|publisher=LA Almanac|url=http://www.laalmanac.com/arts/ar20a.htm}}</ref> the [[Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County]], the [[Exposition Park Rose Garden]], and USC's [[Widney Hall]] (HCM #70) (the oldest university building in Southern California, in continuous use since 1880).\n[[Image:Somerville Hotel, Los Angeles.JPG|thumb|175px|right|The Dunbar Hotel was at the center of the Central Avenue jazz scene in the 1930s and 1940s.]]\n\n'''African-American Music History'''.  The area also includes sites that have played an important role in the city's musical history.  The Ray Charles Worldwide Offices and Studios were designated as a Historic-Cultural Monument (HCM #776) in 2004, and the [[Dunbar Hotel]] (HCM #70) was at the center of the thriving [[Central Avenue (Los Angeles)|Central Avenue]] jazz scene in the 1930s and 1940s.  After hosting the first national convention of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]] to be held in the western United States, the Dunbar hosted [[Duke Ellington]], [[Cab Calloway]], [[Billie Holiday]], [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Lionel Hampton]], [[Count Basie]], [[Lena Horne]] and other jazz legends. Former heavyweight champion [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]] also ran a nightclub at the Dunbar in the 1930s.  And the Lincoln Theatre (HCM #744), built in 1927, was once the crown jewel of Central Avenue, referred to by some as the West Coast's version of [[New York City]]'s [[Apollo Theater]].\n\n'''Ralph J. Bunche House'''.  The [[Ralph J. Bunche House]] (HCM #159), boyhood home of [[Ralph J. Bunche]], the first African-American to win the [[Nobel Peace Prize]], has been preserved as a museum.\n\n'''Vermont Square Branch Library'''.  The city's oldest library building, the [[Vermont Square Branch]] (HCM #264) was built in 1913 in the [[Vermont Square, Los Angeles, California|Vermont Square]] neighborhood  of South Los Angeles.  It is an Italian Renaissance style building with Prairie style proportions built with a grant from [[Andrew Carnegie]].\n\n'''Watts Station'''.  The [[Watts Station]] was designated as a Historic-Cultural Monument (HCM #36) shortly after the [[Watts Riots]] in 1965.  The old wooden railway station, built in 1904, was the only building along Watts' main thoroughfare (which became known as \"Charcoal Alley\") to survive the riots.  The station became a symbol of continuity, hope and renewal for the Watts community.\n\n==Current and former Historic-Cultural Monuments==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:98%\"\n! {{LAHCM style}} width=1% | '''HCM #'''<ref>Numbers in 1-999 series are L.A.
