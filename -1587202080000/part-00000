Initially the tournament was played in the year following the Olympic Games, but since [[1991 FIVB Volleyball Women's World Cup|1991]] the World Cup has been awarded in the year preceding the Olympic Games. The current champion is [[China women's national volleyball team|China]], which won its fifth title at the [[2019 FIVB Volleyball Women's World Cup|2019 tournament]].\n\nThe current format of the competition involves 12 teams, including the automatically qualifying host nation [[Japan women's national volleyball team|Japan]], competing in the tournament phase for the title at venues within the host nation over a period of about two weeks. The World Cup (with exception of the 2019 edition) acts as the first qualification event for the following year's [[Volleyball at the Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] with the top two teams qualifying.\n\nThe 13 World Cup tournaments have been won by five different national teams. [[China women's national volleyball team|China]]<!--For consistency, British English is used throughout the article, which treats teams as plural nouns, e.g., \"China are\" instead of \"China is\".--> have won five times. The other World Cup winners are [[Cuba women's national volleyball team|Cuba]], with four titles; [[Italy women's national volleyball team|Italy]], with two titles; and [[Japan women's national volleyball team|Japan]] and [[Russia women's national volleyball team|Russia]] (as [[Soviet Union women's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]]), with one title each.\n\nThis tournament should not be confused with the [[FIVB Volleyball Women's World Championship]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nThe World Cup was created in 1965 with the purpose of partially filling the gap between the two most important volleyball tournaments, the [[Volleyball at the Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] and the [[FIVB Volleyball Women's World Championship|World Championship]], which take place in alternating 4-year cycles. The establishment of a third international competition would leave only one in every four years with no major events. The World Cup has a smaller entry than the World Championship, with at most 12 teams.\n\nThe World Cup was to be held in the year following the Olympic Games. The first two tournaments were for men's volleyball only; in 1973, a women's tournament was also introduced. Originally, each tournament had a different host, but in 1977 the competition was transferred to [[Japan]] on a permanent basis.\n\nIn the 1990s, the installment of annual international events such as the [[FIVB Volleyball World League|World League]] and the [[FIVB Volleyball World Grand Prix|Grand Prix]] made the original motivations for the creation of the World Cup obsolete. Instead of letting a consolidated event disappear for lack of interest, the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB]] decided to change its format in 1991: it would be held in the year preceding, and not following, the Olympic Games; and it would be considered a first international Olympic qualification tournament, granting the winner a direct berth in the games.\n\nThis move saved the competition. The possibility of securing an early berth for the Olympic Games, thus avoiding extraneous and in some cases tight continental qualification procedures, became a consistent motivation for the national federations to participate in the World Cup. In 1995, the number of Olympic spots granted at the competition was increased to three, as it remained until 2011. In 2015 the number of spots was only two again.\n\n===Winners===\nThe Women's World Cup has had not one great winner, like its counterpart for men's volleyball, but two: [[China women's national volleyball team|China]] and [[Cuba women's national volleyball team|Cuba]].\n\nThe first edition of the tournament was won by the [[Soviet Union women's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]]. [[Japan women's national volleyball team|Japan]], the runner-up of 1973, took the gold in 1977. With the help of superstar player [[Lang Ping]], China won the following two editions, in 1981 and 1985.\n\nThen Cuba stepped forward to begin its amazing World Cup career, winning its first title in 1989. With the tournament now as an Olympic qualifier, there followed three more consecutive victories, in 1991, 1995 and 1999.\n\nChina came back in 2003 with a remarkably offensive team to win its third title.\n\n[[Italy women's national volleyball team|Italy]] won the 2007 edition with an outstanding record of eleven wins in eleven games and only two sets left to the opponents (both lost against [[Serbia women's national volleyball team|Serbia]]). Italy took a second win in a row in 2011, getting the better hand on United States and China. In 2015, China regained the title.\n\n==Competition formula==\nThe World Cup is the most stable from all competition formulas employed by the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB]]. The following rules apply:\n\n*The competition takes place in Japan.\n*Twelve teams participate in each event: ten qualified, two per invitation.\n**[[Japan women's national volleyball team|Japan]] are always pre-qualified as host nation.\n**The winners of the [[FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship|FIVB World Championship]] in the previous year are automatically granted a spot.\n**The champion and runner-up of each continental tournament of that year are granted two spots.\n**Since the 1999 edition, only teams not yet qualified for the following Olympic Games can compete in the World Cup; hence hosts of the following year's Olympic Games are not allowed to compete. There will be an exception for the 2019 World Cup, as the tournament will be hosted by Japan and the country will host the [[2020 Summer Olympics]].\n*The competition is divided in exactly two phases (called \"legs\").\n**Teams are divided in two pools.\n***At the first leg, each team plays one match against all other teams in its pool.\n**At the second leg, each team plays one match against all the teams in the other pool.\n**Matches take place continuously through two weeks, with one-day breaks every two or three days. Each day, six matches are played.\n**Final standings are calculated by usual volleyball criteria: match points, numbers of matches won, sets ratio (the total number of sets won divided by the total number of sets lost), points ratio, direct confrontation.\n*The top two teams in overall standings, regardless of pools, qualify for the following [[Olympic Games]].\n*The tournament implements very tight line-up restrictions: only twelve players are allowed, and no replacement is permitted, even in the case of injuries.\n\n==Results summary==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; width:

Women's World Cup]\n}}\n\nThe '''FIVB Volleyball Women's World Cup''' is an international [[volleyball]] competition contested by the senior women's national teams of the members of ''{{lang|fr|F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball}}'' ([[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB]]), the sport's global governing body. Initially the tournament was played in the year following the Olympic Games, but since [[1991 FIVB Volleyball Women's World Cup|1991]] the World Cup has been awarded in the year preceding the Olympic Games. The current champion is [[China women's national volleyball team|China]], which won its fifth title at the [[2019 FIVB Volleyball Women's World Cup|2019 tournament]].\n\nThe current format of the competition involves 12 teams, including the automatically qualifying host nation [[Japan women's national volleyball team|Japan]], competing in the tournament phase for the title at venues within the host nation over a period of about two weeks. The World Cup (with exception of the 2019 edition) acts as the first qualification event for the following year's [[Volleyball at the Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] with the top two teams qualifying.\n\nThe 13 World Cup tournaments have been won by five different national teams. [[China women's national volleyball team|China]]<!--For consistency, British English is used throughout the article, which treats teams as plural nouns, e.g., \"China are\" instead of \"China is\".--> have won five times. The other World Cup winners are [[Cuba women's national volleyball team|Cuba]], with four titles; [[Italy women's national volleyball team|Italy]], with two titles; and [[Japan women's national volleyball team|Japan]] and [[Russia women's national volleyball team|Russia]] (as [[Soviet Union women's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]]), with one title each.\n\nThis tournament should not be confused with the [[FIVB Volleyball Women's World Championship]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nThe World Cup was created in 1965 with the purpose of partially filling the gap between the two most important volleyball tournaments, the [[Volleyball at the Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] and the [[FIVB Volleyball Women's World Championship|World Championship]], which take place in alternating 4-year cycles. The establishment of a third international competition would leave only one in every four years with no major events. The World Cup has a smaller entry than the World Championship, with at most 12 teams.\n\nThe World Cup was to be held in the year following the Olympic Games. The first two tournaments were for men's volleyball only; in 1973, a women's tournament was also introduced. Originally, each tournament had a different host, but in 1977 the competition was transferred to [[Japan]] on a permanent basis.\n\nIn the 1990s, the installment of annual international events such as the [[FIVB Volleyball World League|World League]] and the [[FIVB Volleyball World Grand Prix|Grand Prix]] made the original motivations for the creation of the World Cup obsolete. Instead of letting a consolidated event disappear for lack of interest, the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB]] decided to change its format in 1991: it would be held in the year preceding, and not following, the Olympic Games; and it would be considered a first international Olympic qualification tournament, granting the winner a direct berth in the games.\n\nThis move saved the competition. The possibility of securing an early berth for the Olympic Games, thus avoiding extraneous and in some cases tight continental qualification procedures, became a consistent motivation for the national federations to participate in the World Cup. In 1995, the number of Olympic spots granted at the competition was increased to three, as it remained until 2011. In 2015 the number of spots was only two again.\n\n===Winners===\nThe Women's World Cup has had not one great winner, like its counterpart for men's volleyball, but two: [[China women's national volleyball team|China]] and [[Cuba women's national volleyball team|Cuba]].\n\nThe first edition of the tournament was won by the [[Soviet Union women's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]]. [[Japan women's national volleyball team|Japan]], the runner-up of 1973, took the gold in 1977. With the help of superstar player [[Lang Ping]], China won the following two editions, in 1981 and 1985.\n\nThen Cuba stepped forward to begin its amazing World Cup career, winning its first title in 1989. With the tournament now as an Olympic qualifier, there followed three more consecutive victories, in 1991, 1995 and 1999.\n\nChina came back in 2003 with a remarkably offensive team to win its third title.\n\n[[Italy women's national volleyball team|Italy]] won the 2007 edition with an outstanding record of eleven wins in eleven games and only two sets left to the opponents (both lost against [[Serbia women's national volleyball team|Serbia]]). Italy took a second win in a row in 2011, getting the better hand on United States and China. In 2015, China regained the title.\n\n==Competition formula==\nThe World Cup is the most stable from all competition formulas employed by the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB]]. The following rules apply:\n\n*The competition takes place in Japan.\n*Twelve teams participate in each event: ten qualified, two per invitation.\n**[[Japan women's national volleyball team|Japan]] are always pre-qualified as host nation.\n**The winners of the [[FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship|FIVB World Championship]] in the previous year are automatically granted a spot.\n**The champion and runner-up of each continental tournament of that year are granted two spots.\n**Since the 1999 edition, only teams not yet qualified for the following Olympic Games can compete in the World Cup; hence hosts of the following year's Olympic Games are not allowed to compete. There will be an exception for the 2019 World Cup, as the tournament will be hosted by Japan and the country will host the [[2020 Summer Olympics]].\n*The competition is divided in exactly two phases (called \"legs\").\n**Teams are divided in two pools.\n***At the first leg, each team plays one match against all other teams in its pool.\n**At the second leg, each team plays one match against all the teams in the other pool.\n**Matches take place continuously through two weeks, with one-day breaks every two or three days. Each day, six matches are played.\n**Final standings are calculated by usual volleyball criteria: match points, numbers of matches won, sets ratio (the total number of sets won divided by the total number of sets lost), points ratio, direct confrontation.\n*The top two teams in overall standings, regardless of pools, qualify for the following [[Olympic Games]].\n*The tournament implements very tight line-up restrictions: only twelve players are allowed, and no replacement is permitted, even in the case of injuries.\n\n==Results summary==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; width:

Announced in May 2013, it is the successor to [[Xbox 360]] and the third console in the [[Xbox#Consoles|Xbox series of video game consoles]]. It was first released in North America, parts of Europe, Australia, and South America in November 2013, and in Japan, China, and other European countries in September 2014. It is the first Xbox game console to be released in China, specifically in the [[Shanghai Free-Trade Zone]]. Microsoft marketed the device as an \"all-in-one entertainment system\", hence the name 'Xbox One'.<ref>https://www.vg247.com/2013/05/28/xbox-one-microsoft-exec-explains-consoles-name/</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Walker|first=Tim|title=Xbox ONE: 'The ultimate all-in-one home entertainment system': Microsoft finally unveils its latest console|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/xbox-one-the-ultimate-allinone-home-entertainment-system-microsoft-finally-unveils-its-latest-console-8626177.html|accessdate=May 23, 2013|work=[[The Independent]]|publisher=Independent Print|date=May 22, 2013}}</ref> The Xbox One mainly competes against [[Sony Interactive Entertainment|Sony]]'s [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Nintendo]]'s [[Wii U]] and [[Nintendo Switch|Switch]].\n\nMoving away from its predecessor's [[PowerPC]]-based [[Computer architecture|architecture]], the Xbox One marks a shift back to the [[x86]] architecture used in the [[Xbox (console)|original Xbox]]; it features an [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]] [[Accelerated Processing Unit]] (APU) built around the [[x86-64]] [[instruction set]]. Xbox One's [[Xbox One controller|controller]] was redesigned over the Xbox 360's, with a redesigned body, [[D-pad]], and triggers capable of delivering directional [[Haptic technology|haptic feedback]]. The console places an increased emphasis on [[cloud computing]], as well as [[social networking]] features, and the ability to [[digital video recorder|record]] and share video clips or screenshots from gameplay, or [[Screencasting|live-stream]] directly to streaming services such as [[Mixer (service)|Mixer]] and [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]]. Games can also be played off-console via a local area network on supported [[Windows 10]] devices. The console can play [[Blu-ray Disc]], and [[video overlay|overlay]] live television programming from an existing [[set-top box]] or a digital tuner for [[digital terrestrial television]] with an enhanced [[electronic program guide|program guide]]. The console optionally included a redesigned [[Kinect]] sensor, marketed as the \"Kinect 2.0\", providing improved [[motion sensing|motion tracking]] and [[Speech recognition|voice recognition]].\n\nThe Xbox One received mostly positive reviews for its refined controller design, multimedia features, and voice navigation. Its quieter and cooler design was praised for making the console more reliable than its predecessor on-launch, but the console was generally criticized for running games at a technically lower graphical level than the PlayStation 4. Its original user interface was panned for being nonintuitive, although changes made to it and other aspects of the console's software post-launch received a positive reception. Its Kinect received praise for its improved motion-tracking accuracy, its face recognition logins, and its voice commands.\n\nThe original Xbox One model was succeeded by the [[#Xbox One S|Xbox One S]] in 2016, which has a smaller form factor and support for [[HDR10]] [[high-dynamic-range video]], as well as support for [[4K resolution|4K]] video playback and [[Video scaler|upscaling]] of games from [[1080p]] to 4K. It was praised for its smaller size, its on-screen visual improvements, and its lack of an external power supply, but its regressions such as the lack of a native Kinect port were noted. A high-end model, named [[#Xbox One X|Xbox One X]], was unveiled in June 2017 and released in November; it features upgraded hardware specifications and support for rendering games at 4K resolution. It will be succeeded by the upcoming [[Xbox Series X]] consoles in Holiday 2020.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:Xbox 360 E and Xbox One - E3 2013.jpg|thumb|left|Xbox One at E3 2013 alongside the [[Xbox 360]] E model|alt=Xbox One on display at E3 2013]]\n\nThe Xbox One is the successor to Xbox 360, Microsoft's previous video game console, which was introduced in 2005 as part of the [[seventh generation of video game consoles]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shacknews.com/article/39629/waiting-for-the-xbox-360|title=Waiting for the Xbox 360|first=Chris|last=Remo|work=[[Shacknews]]|publisher=Gamerhub|date=November 21, 2005|accessdate=June 23, 2015}}</ref> Over the years, the 360 had received a number of small hardware revisions to reduce the unit's size and improve its reliability.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/videos/2013/06/18/unboxing-the-xbox-360-super-slim|title=Unboxing the Xbox 360 Super-Slim|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=June 18, 2013|accessdate=June 22, 2015}}</ref> In 2010, Microsoft's Chris Lewis stated that the 360 was about \"halfway\" through its lifecycle;

La Chapelle brought in a number of personal Xbox titles to test in Perreault's emulation, getting about a 10% \"hit rate\" on successes, though the variety of failures helped Perreault to identify common problems, and within a month, had improved the successful hit rate to about 90%.<ref name=\"ign bc history\"/> As with Xbox 360 backwards compatibility, the Fusion emulation enables Xbox games to be scaled to 1080p resolutions, work with Xbox One networking features, and can allow mixed-console System Link connection between all three generations of Xbox.<ref name=\"ign bc history\"/>\n\nWith Perreault's success, Microsoft announced the Xbox backwards compatibility on the Xbox One in June 2017.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/xbox-one-will-get-compatibility-with-original-xbox-game-1796002721 |title=Xbox One Will Get Compatibility With Original Xbox Games |last=Kohler |first=Chris |date=June 11, 2017 |website=[[Kotaku]] |access-date=June 11, 2017}}</ref> Thirteen titles were initially released on October 24, 2017.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2017/10/23/16520304/original-xbox-backwards-compatibility-xbox-one-release-date | title = Original Xbox compatibility, and 13 games, arriving on Xbox One tomorrow | first = Christopher | last=  Grant | date = October 23, 2017 | accessdate = October 23, 2017 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}</ref> Microsoft announced an additional 19 titles to be added to the Xbox One service during April 2018.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/04/10/morrowind-kotor-2-jade-empire-headline-new-wave-of-original-xbox-backwards-compatible-games | title = Morrowind, Kotor 2, Jade Empire Headline New Wave Of Original Xbox Backwards Compatible Games | first = Brandin |last= Tyrrel | date = April 10, 2018 | accessdate = April 10, 2018 | work = [[IGN]] }}</ref>\n\nMicrosoft does not anticipate that there will be as many Xbox titles brought to the program as with the Xbox 360, primarily due to legal issues related to [[intellectual property]], contracts, and companies that have since gone defunct.<ref name=\"ign bc history\"/>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Pre-release===\nWhile the initial unveiling of the Xbox One in May 2013 created criticism that led to significant changes in the digital rights management scheme it would use, other features of the console were highlighted by journalists. The editorial staff of ''Game Informer'' offered both praise and criticism for the console. Matt Helgeson described the console as Microsoft's intent to \"control the living room\". He called Xbox One's instant switching features \"impressive\", and that the console was \"a step in the right direction\" with regards to TV entertainment, especially the prospect of avoiding the usage of non-intuitive user interfaces often found on cable [[set-top box]]es.

In its launch review, ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' gave the Xbox One an 8/10. Its design was described as \"inoffensive\" but its larger size noted, while the console's quieter and cooler operation was praised for indicating a potentially higher reliability than Xbox 360 was on-launch. The controller was praised for its battery life and \"premium\" design, but some members of the site's staff felt that its shoulder buttons were stiffer than that of previous designs. The design of Xbox One's interface received mixed reviews: noting that it carried over [[Windows 8]]'s [[Metro design language|design language]], the interface was disfavored for hiding functions under the controller's menu button and for being awkward to use with a controller or motion gestures, seemingly encouraging users to use voice navigation instead. While praised for having more \"robust\" voice navigation than Xbox 360, they felt that voice navigation still had a \"[[learning curve]] in understanding what works and what doesn't.\" Although its user following, Smart Match, and improved voice chat features were noted, Xbox Live was panned for not offering the option on-launch to add a real name to user profiles. Despite a regression in local and network multimedia functionality in comparison to Xbox 360 and how OneGuide interacted with outside set-top boxes (drawing comparisons to the operations of [[TiVo]] DVRs), ''Polygon'' felt the Xbox One's overall multimedia experience \"feels like a major step forward in set-top boxes and makes the Xbox One the obvious centre of any living room that has one.\"<ref name=polygon-xb1review>{{cite web|title=The Xbox One Review|url=http://www.polygon.com/a/xbox-one-review|website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|accessdate=December 16, 2014}}</ref>\n\nBen Gilbert of ''[[Engadget]]'' was similarly modest upon its launch, assigning the console a score of 81/100 and describing the Xbox One's design as a \"1993 artist's rendering of 2013's technology\". Acknowledging that its controller was a mere refinement of the \"ubiquit[ous]\" Xbox 360 design, he praised the controller for its improved D-pad and quieter triggers but criticized its stiff shoulder buttons. Kinect received positive reviews for its face recognition login and improved motion tracking, but that whilst \"magical\", \"every false positive or unrecognized [voice] command had us reaching for the controller.\" The overall interface was also considered more intuitive and flexible than that of PlayStation 4, but its game library view was described as being a \"jumbled, sadly unfilterable rows of every owned piece of software\", that also knowingly listed games that require their disc to run alongside those which did not. The console was also panned for missing certain promised features on-launch, such as Upload Studio, game streaming, and certain apps/services.<ref name=engadget-2013review>{{cite web|title=Xbox One review: a fast and powerful work in progress|url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/11/20/microsoft-xbox-one-review/|first=Ben|last=Gilbert|work=[[Engadget]]|publisher=[[AOL]]|date=November 20, 2013|accessdate=December 16, 2014}}</ref>\n\nLater on, critics felt that the Xbox One's functionality had matured over the year following its launch; Jeff Bakalar of ''[[CNET]]'', assigning it a score of 8/10, acknowledged improvements to Xbox One's software since its original release, but that its user interface was still unintuitive in comparison to Xbox 360 and PlayStation 4, explaining that \"navigating the interface seems to be much more problematic than it rightfully should be, and there's simply not enough transparency in the logic within it. There are oddities peppered throughout, which is the root for countless headaches and frustrations.\" Xbox One's in-game performance was mixed, with some titles showing slower performance over PS4, but some multi-platform games performing better on Xbox One than PS4. CNET praised the wider lineup of multimedia services and apps on Xbox One over PS4, not requiring Xbox Live Gold for online save data storage, support for high-speed [[USB 3.0]] as secondary storage, and having a \"slightly better\" lineup of upcoming exclusives, concluding that \"While the PS4 had a clear advantage at launch, that edge is slowly evaporating as Microsoft has worked feverishly to undo most of the Xbox One's original missteps.\"<ref name=cnet-nov14review>{{cite web|title=Slow and steady, the Xbox One gradually improves|url=https://www.cnet.com/products/microsoft-xbox-one/|first=Jeff|last=Bakalar|website=[[CNET]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|date=November 16, 2015|accessdate=December 16, 2014}}</ref>\n\nNick Pino of ''[[TechRadar]]'', giving it four stars out of five, similarly felt that the Xbox One \"[felt] more like a media titan today than it did 12 months ago,\" citing OneGuide, Upload Studio, and Microsoft's decision to drop the Xbox Live Gold requirement for multimedia streaming apps, and that \"there's still a lot of potential locked away inside the hardware of the system that developers are just beginning to figure out. So while PlayStation might have the upper hand for now when it comes to certain third-party titles, it may not always remain that way. Just how Microsoft will get it to that point, though, is still a mystery.\" However, he disfavored the console's dependence upon a subscription for most of its functionality, Kinect's voice recognition, and that some games do not natively run at [[1080p]] resolution, but are [[video scaler|upscaled]].<ref name=techradar-xb1review /> In an August 2016 review of the Xbox One S model, ''TechRadar'' further commended Microsoft's recent improvements to Xbox One, citing a strong lineup of first-party titles in 2015 and further improvements to the console's interface.<ref name=\"TechRadar-one review\">{{cite web|title=Xbox One S review|url=http://www.techradar.com/us/reviews/gaming/games-consoles/xbox-one-s-1323399/review|first=Nick|last=Pino|website=[[TechRadar]]|publisher=[[Future plc]]|date=|accessdate=August 4, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAlaina Yee of [[IGN]] also praised how Xbox One had evolved since its launch, assigning it with Kinect a score of 8.1/10 and acknowledging that Microsoft had \"made good on its promise of listening to consumers, rolling out a steady stream of updates that have both broadened and deepened what this third Xbox console offers.\" Regarding the console's slightly lower level of graphics capabilities in comparison to PlayStation 4, it was noted that \"while videophiles might spot instances of upscaled graphics and less detailed environments immediately, most people generally won't notice a difference between Xbox One and PlayStation 4 versions of a game (when there is one) unless they see both running side by side\", and examples of \"gorgeous\" Xbox One games were noted, such as ''[[Sunset Overdrive]]'' and ''[[Forza Motorsport 5]]''. The number of \"hidden\" options in Xbox One's user interface was equated to \"hunting for treasure in a messy room\"; as such, Kinect voice commands, in combination with access to common functions within the [[Xbox SmartGlass]] app, were praised for helping to provide a more streamlined user experience.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/27/xbox-one-with-kinect-review|title=Xbox One with Kinect Review|first=Alaina|last=Yee|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=November 26, 2014|accessdate=June 23, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Xbox One S revision was critically praised for its improvements over the original model, including its streamlined design, the addition of HDR and 4K video support, and visual improvements on some games (such as ''[[Fallout 4]]'' and ''[[Rise of the Tomb Raider]]'') when upscaled to 4K. However, ''[[TechRadar]]'' noted regressions such as the lack of a Kinect port (considered \"one last kick in the pants for all the gamers forced into buying the more expensive console bundle two short years ago\"), and concerns that the revised hardware and HDR support would lead to [[Fragmentation (programming)|fragmentation]] of Xbox One's ecosystem, as not all users will necessarily experience a game the same way.<ref name=\"TechRadar-one review\"/>\n\nDieter Bohn of ''[[The Verge]]'' similarly felt that although it was one of the cheapest 4K Blu-ray players on the market,  consumers were more interested in streaming 4K content (which could be accomplished with cheaper [[digital media player]]s) than 4K Blu-ray discs, and noted the small number of HDR-enabled games on launch.

Phil Spencer stated that this rule was intended to ensure that Xbox One was a \"first-class\" platform by discouraging staggered releases. However, these policies resulted in some studios, such as [[Vlambeer]] (developer of ''[[Nuclear Throne]]'') choosing to negotiate console exclusivity with Sony instead, who proved to be more receptive to indie development. By July 2015, Microsoft had changed its policies in response to the criticism, with Spencer admitting that this policy was onerous on smaller studios. Spencer also stated that Microsoft was willing to work with studios to help make the Xbox launches of former timed exclusives \"special in some way\", so that customers are not simply purchasing \"last year's game\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-ones-launch-parity-clause-is-pretty-much-over/1100-6429261/|title=Xbox One's Launch Parity Clause Is Pretty Much Over, Exec Says|last=Newhouse|first=Alex|date=2015-07-28|website=GameSpot|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-ones-parity-clause-meant-to-make-owners-feel-/1100-6422886/|title=Xbox One's Parity Clause Meant to Make Owners Feel \"First Class\"|last=Pereira|first=Chris|date=2014-10-10|website=GameSpot|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-05}}</ref>\n\n===Sales===\nMicrosoft only publicized its sales figures during the first year after release.

Announced in May 2013, it is the successor to [[Xbox 360]] and the third console in the [[Xbox#Consoles|Xbox series of video game consoles]]. It was first released in North America, parts of Europe, Australia, and South America in November 2013, and in Japan, China, and other European countries in September 2014. It is the first Xbox game console to be released in China, specifically in the [[Shanghai Free-Trade Zone]]. Microsoft marketed the device as an \"all-in-one entertainment system\", hence the name 'Xbox One'.<ref>https://www.vg247.com/2013/05/28/xbox-one-microsoft-exec-explains-consoles-name/</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Walker|first=Tim|title=Xbox ONE: 'The ultimate all-in-one home entertainment system': Microsoft finally unveils its latest console|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/xbox-one-the-ultimate-allinone-home-entertainment-system-microsoft-finally-unveils-its-latest-console-8626177.html|accessdate=May 23, 2013|work=[[The Independent]]|publisher=Independent Print|date=May 22, 2013}}</ref> The Xbox One mainly competes against [[Sony Interactive Entertainment|Sony]]'s [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Nintendo]]'s [[Wii U]] and [[Nintendo Switch|Switch]].\n\nMoving away from its predecessor's [[PowerPC]]-based [[Computer architecture|architecture]], the Xbox One marks a shift back to the [[x86]] architecture used in the [[Xbox (console)|original Xbox]]; it features an [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]] [[Accelerated Processing Unit]] (APU) built around the [[x86-64]] [[instruction set]]. Xbox One's [[Xbox One controller|controller]] was redesigned over the Xbox 360's, with a redesigned body, [[D-pad]], and triggers capable of delivering directional [[Haptic technology|haptic feedback]]. The console places an increased emphasis on [[cloud computing]], as well as [[social networking]] features, and the ability to [[digital video recorder|record]] and share video clips or screenshots from gameplay, or [[Screencasting|live-stream]] directly to streaming services such as [[Mixer (service)|Mixer]] and [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]]. Games can also be played off-console via a local area network on supported [[Windows 10]] devices. The console can play [[Blu-ray Disc]], and [[video overlay|overlay]] live television programming from an existing [[set-top box]] or a digital tuner for [[digital terrestrial television]] with an enhanced [[electronic program guide|program guide]]. The console optionally included a redesigned [[Kinect]] sensor, marketed as the \"Kinect 2.0\", providing improved [[motion sensing|motion tracking]] and [[Speech recognition|voice recognition]].\n\nThe Xbox One received mostly positive reviews for its refined controller design, multimedia features, and voice navigation. Its quieter and cooler design was praised for making the console more reliable than its predecessor on-launch, but the console was generally criticized for running games at a technically lower graphical level than the PlayStation 4. Its original user interface was panned for being nonintuitive, although changes made to it and other aspects of the console's software post-launch received a positive reception. Its Kinect received praise for its improved motion-tracking accuracy, its face recognition logins, and its voice commands.\n\nThe original Xbox One model was succeeded by the [[#Xbox One S|Xbox One S]] in 2016, which has a smaller form factor and support for [[HDR10]] [[high-dynamic-range video]], as well as support for [[4K resolution|4K]] video playback and [[Video scaler|upscaling]] of games from [[1080p]] to 4K. It was praised for its smaller size, its on-screen visual improvements, and its lack of an external power supply, but its regressions such as the lack of a native Kinect port were noted. A high-end model, named [[#Xbox One X|Xbox One X]], was unveiled in June 2017 and released in November; it features upgraded hardware specifications and support for rendering games at 4K resolution. It will be succeeded by the upcoming [[Xbox Series X]] consoles in Holiday 2020.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:Xbox 360 E and Xbox One - E3 2013.jpg|thumb|left|Xbox One at E3 2013 alongside the [[Xbox 360]] E model|alt=Xbox One on display at E3 2013]]\n\nThe Xbox One is the successor to Xbox 360, Microsoft's previous video game console, which was introduced in 2005 as part of the [[seventh generation of video game consoles]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shacknews.com/article/39629/waiting-for-the-xbox-360|title=Waiting for the Xbox 360|first=Chris|last=Remo|work=[[Shacknews]]|publisher=Gamerhub|date=November 21, 2005|accessdate=June 23, 2015}}</ref> Over the years, the 360 had received a number of small hardware revisions to reduce the unit's size and improve its reliability.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/videos/2013/06/18/unboxing-the-xbox-360-super-slim|title=Unboxing the Xbox 360 Super-Slim|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=June 18, 2013|accessdate=June 22, 2015}}</ref> In 2010, Microsoft's Chris Lewis stated that the 360 was about \"halfway\" through its lifecycle;

Critics felt that the changes would infringe on consumers' [[First-sale doctrine|first-sale rights]] for games purchased on physical media, as games would only be [[Software license|licensed]] to users rather than sold, and the disc itself would only be used to install the game and not confer ownership of its license or permission to resell. Microsoft also stated that game publishers would decide whether the physical copies of their games would be eligible for resale, and could impose restrictions or activation fees on second-hand copies of games.

La Chapelle brought in a number of personal Xbox titles to test in Perreault's emulation, getting about a 10% \"hit rate\" on successes, though the variety of failures helped Perreault to identify common problems, and within a month, had improved the successful hit rate to about 90%.<ref name=\"ign bc history\"/> As with Xbox 360 backwards compatibility, the Fusion emulation enables Xbox games to be scaled to 1080p resolutions, work with Xbox One networking features, and can allow mixed-console System Link connection between all three generations of Xbox.<ref name=\"ign bc history\"/>\n\nWith Perreault's success, Microsoft announced the Xbox backwards compatibility on the Xbox One in June 2017.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/xbox-one-will-get-compatibility-with-original-xbox-game-1796002721 |title=Xbox One Will Get Compatibility With Original Xbox Games |last=Kohler |first=Chris |date=June 11, 2017 |website=[[Kotaku]] |access-date=June 11, 2017}}</ref> Thirteen titles were initially released on October 24, 2017.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2017/10/23/16520304/original-xbox-backwards-compatibility-xbox-one-release-date | title = Original Xbox compatibility, and 13 games, arriving on Xbox One tomorrow | first = Christopher | last=  Grant | date = October 23, 2017 | accessdate = October 23, 2017 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}</ref> Microsoft announced an additional 19 titles to be added to the Xbox One service during April 2018.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/04/10/morrowind-kotor-2-jade-empire-headline-new-wave-of-original-xbox-backwards-compatible-games | title = Morrowind, Kotor 2, Jade Empire Headline New Wave Of Original Xbox Backwards Compatible Games | first = Brandin |last= Tyrrel | date = April 10, 2018 | accessdate = April 10, 2018 | work = [[IGN]] }}</ref>\n\nMicrosoft does not anticipate that there will be as many Xbox titles brought to the program as with the Xbox 360, primarily due to legal issues related to [[intellectual property]], contracts, and companies that have since gone defunct.<ref name=\"ign bc history\"/>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Pre-release===\nWhile the initial unveiling of the Xbox One in May 2013 created criticism that led to significant changes in the digital rights management scheme it would use, other features of the console were highlighted by journalists. The editorial staff of ''Game Informer'' offered both praise and criticism for the console. Matt Helgeson described the console as Microsoft's intent to \"control the living room\". He called Xbox One's instant switching features \"impressive\", and that the console was \"a step in the right direction\" with regards to TV entertainment, especially the prospect of avoiding the usage of non-intuitive user interfaces often found on cable [[set-top box]]es. Jeff Cork said that Microsoft had \"some great ideas\" for the console, but that it failed to properly communicate them.<ref name=\"GI-Reveal\">{{cite web|url=https://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2013/05/22/game-informer-editors-react-to-xbox-one-news.aspx|title=Game Informer Editors React To Xbox One News|first=Matt|last=Bertz|work=[[GameInformer]]|publisher=GameStop|date=May 22, 2013|accessdate=June 11, 2013}}</ref>\n\nMicrosoft's E3 2013 press conference was criticized for focusing too much on games that, beyond increased graphical capabilities, provided experiences that were otherwise similar to previous-generation games\u2014giving little incentive for buying the new console.<ref>{{cite news|last=Walton|first=Mark|title=The Uninspired Lineup of Xbox One|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-uninspired-lineup-of-xbox-one/1100-6409579/|work=[[GameSpot]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=December 13, 2016|date=June 12, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=McShea|first=Tom|title=Xbox One: New Console, Old Games|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-one-new-console-old-games/1100-6409577/|work=[[GameSpot]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=December 13, 2016|date=June 12, 2013}}</ref> Rafi Mohammed, author of \"The Art of Pricing\", felt that Microsoft priced Xbox One \"too high\" and that the $100 premium over its competitor could \"derail\" the system during the 2013 holiday season.<ref>{{cite news|last=Mohammed|first=Rafi|title=Did Microsoft Overshoot on Xbox One Pricing? |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/video/did-microsoft-overshoot-on-xbox-one-pricing-4~~kjSH9TReVJAd9tivMpA.html|publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]|accessdate=June 23, 2013|date=June 21, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Makuch|first=Eddie|title=Xbox One pricing \"too high\" says business author|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-one-pricing-too-high-says-business-author/1100-6410607/|work=[[GameSpot]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=December 13, 2016|date=June 24, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Critical reception===\nUpon its release, the Xbox One received favorable reviews from critics and reviewers. In its launch review, ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' gave the Xbox One an 8/10. Its design was described as \"inoffensive\" but its larger size noted, while the console's quieter and cooler operation was praised for indicating a potentially higher reliability than Xbox 360 was on-launch. The controller was praised for its battery life and \"premium\" design, but some members of the site's staff felt that its shoulder buttons were stiffer than that of previous designs. The design of Xbox One's interface received mixed reviews: noting that it carried over [[Windows 8]]'s [[Metro design language|design language]], the interface was disfavored for hiding functions under the controller's menu button and for being awkward to use with a controller or motion gestures, seemingly encouraging users to use voice navigation instead. While praised for having more \"robust\" voice navigation than Xbox 360, they felt that voice navigation still had a \"[[learning curve]] in understanding what works and what doesn't.\" Although its user following, Smart Match, and improved voice chat features were noted, Xbox Live was panned for not offering the option on-launch to add a real name to user profiles. Despite a regression in local and network multimedia functionality in comparison to Xbox 360 and how OneGuide interacted with outside set-top boxes (drawing comparisons to the operations of [[TiVo]] DVRs), ''Polygon'' felt the Xbox One's overall multimedia experience \"feels like a major step forward in set-top boxes and makes the Xbox One the obvious center of any living room that has one.\"<ref name=polygon-xb1review>{{cite web|title=The Xbox One Review|url=http://www.polygon.com/a/xbox-one-review|website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|accessdate=December 16, 2014}}</ref>\n\nBen Gilbert of ''[[Engadget]]'' was similarly modest upon its launch, assigning the console a score of 81/100 and describing the Xbox One's design as a \"1993 artist's rendering of 2013's technology\". Acknowledging that its controller was a mere refinement of the \"ubiquit[ous]\" Xbox 360 design, he praised the controller for its improved D-pad and quieter triggers but criticized its stiff shoulder buttons. Kinect received positive reviews for its face recognition login and improved motion tracking, but that whilst \"magical\", \"every false positive or unrecognized [voice] command had us reaching for the controller.\" The overall interface was also considered more intuitive and flexible than that of PlayStation 4, but its game library view was described as being a \"jumbled, sadly unfilterable rows of every owned piece of software\", that also knowingly listed games that require their disc to run alongside those which did not. The console was also panned for missing certain promised features on-launch, such as Upload Studio, game streaming, and certain apps/services.<ref name=engadget-2013review>{{cite web|title=Xbox One review: a fast and powerful work in progress|url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/11/20/microsoft-xbox-one-review/|first=Ben|last=Gilbert|work=[[Engadget]]|publisher=[[AOL]]|date=November 20, 2013|accessdate=December 16, 2014}}</ref>\n\nLater on, critics felt that the Xbox One's functionality had matured over the year following its launch; Jeff Bakalar of ''[[CNET]]'', assigning it a score of 8/10, acknowledged improvements to Xbox One's software since its original release, but that its user interface was still unintuitive in comparison to Xbox 360 and PlayStation 4, explaining that \"navigating the interface seems to be much more problematic than it rightfully should be, and there's simply not enough transparency in the logic within it. There are oddities peppered throughout, which is the root for countless headaches and frustrations.\" Xbox One's in-game performance was mixed, with some titles showing slower performance over PS4, but some multi-platform games performing better on Xbox One than PS4. CNET praised the wider lineup of multimedia services and apps on Xbox One over PS4, not requiring Xbox Live Gold for online save data storage, support for high-speed [[USB 3.0]] as secondary storage, and having a \"slightly better\" lineup of upcoming exclusives, concluding that \"While the PS4 had a clear advantage at launch, that edge is slowly evaporating as Microsoft has worked feverishly to undo most of the Xbox One's original missteps.\"<ref name=cnet-nov14review>{{cite web|title=Slow and steady, the Xbox One gradually improves|url=https://www.cnet.com/products/microsoft-xbox-one/|first=Jeff|last=Bakalar|website=[[CNET]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|date=November 16, 2015|accessdate=December 16, 2014}}</ref>\n\nNick Pino of ''[[TechRadar]]'', giving it four stars out of five, similarly felt that the Xbox One \"[felt] more like a media titan today than it did 12 months ago,\" citing OneGuide, Upload Studio, and Microsoft's decision to drop the Xbox Live Gold requirement for multimedia streaming apps, and that \"there's still a lot of potential locked away inside the hardware of the system that developers are just beginning to figure out. So while PlayStation might have the upper hand for now when it comes to certain third-party titles, it may not always remain that way. Just how Microsoft will get it to that point, though, is still a mystery.\" However, he disfavored the console's dependence upon a subscription for most of its functionality, Kinect's voice recognition, and that some games do not natively run at [[1080p]] resolution, but are [[video scaler|upscaled]].<ref name=techradar-xb1review /> In an August 2016 review of the Xbox One S model, ''TechRadar'' further commended Microsoft's recent improvements to Xbox One, citing a strong lineup of first-party titles in 2015 and further improvements to the console's interface.<ref name=\"techradar-onesreview\">{{cite web|title=Xbox One S review|url=http://www.techradar.com/us/reviews/gaming/games-consoles/xbox-one-s-1323399/review|first=Nick|last=Pino|website=[[TechRadar]]|publisher=[[Future plc]]|date=|accessdate=August 4, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAlaina Yee of [[IGN]] also praised how Xbox One had evolved since its launch, assigning it with Kinect a score of 8.1/10 and acknowledging that Microsoft had \"made good on its promise of listening to consumers, rolling out a steady stream of updates that have both broadened and deepened what this third Xbox console offers.\" Regarding the console's slightly lower level of graphics capabilities in comparison to PlayStation 4, it was noted that \"while videophiles might spot instances of upscaled graphics and less detailed environments immediately, most people generally won't notice a difference between Xbox One and PlayStation 4 versions of a game (when there is one) unless they see both running side by side\", and examples of \"gorgeous\" Xbox One games were noted, such as ''[[Sunset Overdrive]]'' and ''[[Forza Motorsport 5]]''. The number of \"hidden\" options in Xbox One's user interface was equated to \"hunting for treasure in a messy room\"; as such, Kinect voice commands, in combination with access to common functions within the [[Xbox SmartGlass]] app, were praised for helping to provide a more streamlined user experience.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/27/xbox-one-with-kinect-review|title=Xbox One with Kinect Review|first=Alaina|last=Yee|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=November 26, 2014|accessdate=June 23, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Xbox One S revision was critically praised for its improvements over the original model, including its streamlined design, the addition of HDR and 4K video support, and visual improvements on some games (such as ''[[Fallout 4]]'' and ''[[Rise of the Tomb Raider]]'') when upscaled to 4K. However, ''[[TechRadar]]'' noted regressions such as the lack of a Kinect port (considered \"one last kick in the pants for all the gamers forced into buying the more expensive console bundle two short years ago\"), and concerns that the revised hardware and HDR support would lead to [[Fragmentation (programming)|fragmentation]] of Xbox One's ecosystem, as not all users will necessarily experience a game the same way.<ref name=\"techradar-onesreview\"/>\n\nDieter Bohn of ''[[The Verge]]'' similarly felt that although it was one of the cheapest 4K Blu-ray players on the market,  consumers were more interested in streaming 4K content (which could be accomplished with cheaper [[digital media player]]s) than 4K Blu-ray discs, and noted the small number of HDR-enabled games on launch. Bohn concluded that the Xbox One S would appeal best to new owners or those who wish to leverage its HDR and 4K support, but recommended that existing owners consider [[Xbox One X]] instead.<ref name=\"verge-onesreview\">{{cite web|title=Xbox One S review|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/2/12348212/microsoft-xbox-one-s-review|first=Dieter|last=Bohn|website=[[The Verge]]|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|date=August 2, 2016|accessdate=December 31, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"verge-no4kbluray\">{{cite web|title=Sony's new PlayStation 4 Pro can't play 4K Blu-rays|url=https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/9/7/12839756/sony-ps4-no-4k-uhd-blu-ray|first=Chris|last=Welch|website=[[The Verge]]|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|date=September 7, 2016|accessdate=December 3, 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Lack of exclusive titles ===\nThe Xbox One platform has faced criticism for lacking in [[Console exclusivity|exclusive releases]] over competitors such as PlayStation 4 and [[Nintendo Switch]]. Although there have been releases in flagship Microsoft franchises such as ''[[Forza (series)|Forza]]'' and ''[[Halo (franchise)|Halo]]'', they have underperformed in comparison to other entries, while several major Xbox One exclusives have faced notable delays, such as ''[[Crackdown 3]]'',  or outright cancellations, including ''[[Fable Legends]]'' and ''[[Scalebound]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/09/microsoft-confirms-scalebound-is-cancelled|title=Microsoft Confirms Scalebound is Cancelled|last=Goldfarb|first=Andrew|date=2017-01-09|website=IGN|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-05}}</ref> By contrast, PS4 and Switch have seen a large number of critically successful first- and third-party exclusives, and [[Activision]] would sign with [[Sony Interactive Entertainment]] for timed exclusivity on certain add-on content in the ''[[Call of Duty]]'' and ''[[Destiny (video game)|Destiny]]'' franchises\u2014the former having replaced a previous deal with Microsoft.<ref name=\"verge-exclusives\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/22/15010540/video-game-exclusives-ps4-xbox-one-switch-zelda-horizon-scorpio-first-party|title=The Xbox One is struggling because video game exclusives still matter|work=The Verge|access-date=2018-08-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.engadget.com/2017/12/28/xboxs-lack-of-compelling-games-wont-be-fixed-next-year/|title=Xbox's lack of compelling games won't be fixed next year|work=Engadget|access-date=2018-08-05|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nAn analyst also noted that Microsoft's first-party studios were not as strong as those of Sony, explaining that \"Sony has always been about first party and Microsoft wanted to emulate that, but they allowed studios like [[Rare (company)|Rare]] and [[Lionhead Studios|Lionhead]] to fade away.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/1/29/16930892/xbox-one-exclusive-games-analysis-microsoft|title=The Xbox One has a serious exclusive games problem|work=Polygon|access-date=2018-08-05}}</ref> In 2018, Microsoft acquired a large number of third-party studios, including [[Compulsion Games]], [[InXile Entertainment]], [[Ninja Theory]], [[Obsidian Entertainment]], [[Playground Games]], and [[Undead Labs]], and hired former [[Crystal Dynamics]] head Darrell Gallagher to lead a new Microsoft studio known as The Initiative.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/10/17446914/microsoft-studios-the-initiative-undead-labs-playground-games-ninja-theory-compulsion-games-xbox-e3|title=Microsoft announces big, multistudio push to create more Xbox exclusives|work=The Verge|access-date=2018-08-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/10/18082922/microsoft-xbox-inxile-obsidian-entertainment-studio-acquisition|title=Microsoft's Xbox exclusives push continues with new studio acquisitions|last=Warren|first=Tom|date=2018-11-10|website=The Verge|access-date=2018-12-18}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, Microsoft began to make future Xbox One-exclusive first-party releases simultaneously available on [[Windows 10]] PCs, with digital cross-buy support via [[Microsoft Store (digital)|Microsoft Store]] under the branding [[Xbox Play Anywhere]].

Phil Spencer stated that this rule was intended to ensure that Xbox One was a \"first-class\" platform by discouraging staggered releases. However, these policies resulted in some studios, such as [[Vlambeer]] (developer of ''[[Nuclear Throne]]'') choosing to negotiate console exclusivity with Sony instead, who proved to be more receptive to indie development. By July 2015, Microsoft had changed its policies in response to the criticism, with Spencer admitting that this policy was onerous on smaller studios. Spencer also stated that Microsoft was willing to work with studios to help make the Xbox launches of former timed exclusives \"special in some way\", so that customers are not simply purchasing \"last year's game\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-ones-launch-parity-clause-is-pretty-much-over/1100-6429261/|title=Xbox One's Launch Parity Clause Is Pretty Much Over, Exec Says|last=Newhouse|first=Alex|date=2015-07-28|website=GameSpot|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-ones-parity-clause-meant-to-make-owners-feel-/1100-6422886/|title=Xbox One's Parity Clause Meant to Make Owners Feel \"First Class\"|last=Pereira|first=Chris|date=2014-10-10|website=GameSpot|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-05}}</ref>\n\n===Sales===\nMicrosoft only publicized its sales figures during the first year after release.

Westview Press, Boulder, CO.</ref>\n\n=== Ethics ===\nMost agricultural professionals agree that there is a \"moral obligation to pursue [the] goal [of] sustainability.\"<ref name=\"Dundon2009\" /> The major debate comes from what system will provide a path to that goal because if an unsustainable method is used on a large scale it will have a massive negative effect on the environment and human population. \n\n==Factors affecting sustainability==\n[[File:Traditional ploughing - Karnataka.jpg|thumb|left |Traditional farming methods have a low [[carbon footprint]].]]\n\nPractices that can cause long-term damage to [[soil]] include excessive [[Tillage|tilling]] of the soil (leading to [[erosion]]) and [[irrigation]] without adequate drainage (leading to [[Soil salinity|salinization]]).\n\n[[File:Conservation farming 02.jpg |thumb |upright |Conservation farming in [[Zambia]]]]\n\nThe most important factors for a farming site are [[climate]], soil, [[nutrient]]s and [[water resources]]. Of the four, water and [[soil conservation]] are the most amenable to human intervention.\nWhen farmers grow and harvest crops, they remove some nutrients from the soil. Without replenishment, land suffers from [[nutrient depletion]] and becomes either unusable or suffers from reduced [[Crop yield|yields]]. Sustainable agriculture depends on replenishing the soil while minimizing the use or need of non-renewable resources, such as [[natural gas]] or mineral ores.\n\nA farm that is able to \"produce perpetually\", yet has negative effects on environmental quality elsewhere is not sustainable agriculture. An example of a case in which a global view may be warranted is application of [[fertilizer]] or [[manure]], which can improve productivity of a farm but can pollute nearby rivers and coastal waters ([[eutrophication]]). The other extreme can also be undesirable, as the problem of low crop yields due to exhaustion of nutrients in the soil has been related to [[rainforest]] destruction. In Asia, the specific amount of land needed for sustainable farming is about 12.5 acres which includes land for animal fodder, cereal production as cash crop and other food crops.

Sustainable intensification encompasses specific agriculture methods that increase production and at the same time help improve environmental outcomes. The desired outcomes of the farm are achieved without the need for more land cultivation or destruction of natural habitat; the system performance is upgraded with no net environmental cost. Sustainable Intensification has become a priority for the United Nations. Sustainable intensification differs from prior intensification methods by specifically placing importance on broader environmental outcomes. By the year 2018; it was predicted in 100 nations a combined total of 163 million farms used sustainable intensification. The amount of agricultural land covered by this is 453 million ha of land. That amount of land is equal to 29% of farms worldwide.<ref>Pretty. J. (November 23, 2018). Intensification for redesigned and sustainable agriculture systems; http://science.sciencemag.org/content/362/6417/eaav0294/tab-pdf</ref> In light of concerns about [[food security]], [[human population]] growth and dwindling land suitable for agriculture, sustainable intensive farming practises are needed to maintain high [[crop yields]], while maintaining [[soil health]] and [[ecosystem services]]. The capacity for ecosystem services to be strong enough to allow a reduction in use of non-renewable inputs whilst maintaining or boosting yields has been the subject of much debate. Recent work in irrigated rice production system of east Asia has suggested that - in relation to pest management at least - promoting the ecosystem service of biological control using nectar plants can reduce the need for insecticides by 70% whilst delivering a 5% yield advantage compared with standard practice.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gurr |first1=Geoff M. |display-authors=etal |title=Multi-country evidence that crop diversification promotes ecological intensification of agriculture |journal=Nature Plants |date=2016 |volume=2 |issue=3 |page=16014 |doi=10.1038/nplants.2016.14 |pmid=27249349}}</ref>\n\n[[Vertical farming]] is a concept with the potential advantages of year-round production, isolation from pests and diseases, controllable resource recycling and reduced transportation costs.<ref name=Marks2014>{{Cite news |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22129524-100-vertical-farms-sprouting-all-over-the-world/ |title=Vertical farms sprouting all over the world |last=Marks |first=Paul |date=15 January 2014 |work=New Scientist|accessdate=8 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Water===\n[[Water efficiency]] can be improved by reducing the need for [[irrigation]] and using alternative methods.

Westview Press, Boulder, CO.</ref>\n\n=== Ethics ===\nMost agricultural professionals agree that there is a \"moral obligation to pursue [the] goal [of] sustainability.\"<ref name=\"Dundon2009\" /> The major debate comes from what system will provide a path to that goal because if an unsustainable method is used on a large scale it will have a massive negative effect on the environment and human population. \n\n==Factors affecting sustainability==\n[[File:Traditional ploughing - Karnataka.jpg|thumb|left |Traditional farming methods have a low [[carbon footprint]].]]\n\nPractices that can cause long-term damage to [[soil]] include excessive [[Tillage|tilling]] of the soil (leading to [[erosion]]) and [[irrigation]] without adequate drainage (leading to [[Soil salinity|salinization]]).\n\n[[File:Conservation farming 02.jpg |thumb |upright |Conservation farming in [[Zambia]]]]\n\nThe most important factors for a farming site are [[climate]], soil, [[nutrient]]s and [[water resources]]. Of the four, water and [[soil conservation]] are the most amenable to human intervention.\nWhen farmers grow and harvest crops, they remove some nutrients from the soil. Without replenishment, land suffers from [[nutrient depletion]] and becomes either unusable or suffers from reduced [[Crop yield|yields]]. Sustainable agriculture depends on replenishing the soil while minimizing the use or need of non-renewable resources, such as [[natural gas]] or mineral ores.\n\nA farm that is able to \"produce perpetually\", yet has negative effects on environmental quality elsewhere is not sustainable agriculture. An example of a case in which a global view may be warranted is application of [[fertilizer]] or [[manure]], which can improve productivity of a farm but can pollute nearby rivers and coastal waters ([[eutrophication]]). The other extreme can also be undesirable, as the problem of low crop yields due to exhaustion of nutrients in the soil has been related to [[rainforest]] destruction. In Asia, the specific amount of land needed for sustainable farming is about 12.5 acres which includes land for animal fodder, cereal production as cash crop and other food crops. In some cases, a small unit of aquaculture is included (AARI-1996).\n\n===Nutrients===\n====Nitrates====\nPossible sources of [[nitrate]]s that would, in principle, be available indefinitely, include:\n\n#recycling crop waste and [[livestock]] or treated [[humanure|human manure]]\n#growing [[legume]] crops and [[forage]]<nowiki/>s such as [[peanut]]s or [[alfalfa]] that form symbioses with [[nitrogen fixation|nitrogen-fixing]] [[bacteria]] called [[rhizobia]]\n#industrial production of nitrogen by the [[Haber process]] uses hydrogen, which is currently derived from natural gas (but this hydrogen could instead be made by [[electrolysis]] of water using renewable electricity)\n#genetically engineering (non-legume) crops to form nitrogen-fixing symbioses or fix nitrogen without microbial symbionts.\n\nThe last option was proposed in the 1970s, but is only gradually becoming feasible.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.mongabay.com/bioenergy/2008/03/scientists-discover-genetics-of.html |title=Scientists discover genetics of nitrogen fixation in plants - potential implications for future agriculture |publisher=News.mongabay.com |date=2008-03-08 |accessdate=2013-09-10}}</ref><ref>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, March 25, 2008 vol. 105 no. 12 4928\u20134932 [http://www.pnas.org/content/105/12/4928.full.pdf+html]</ref> Sustainable options for replacing other nutrient inputs such as phosphorus and potassium are more limited.\n\nOther options include [[shifting cultivation|long-term crop rotations]], returning to natural cycles that annually flood cultivated lands (returning lost nutrients) such as the [[flooding of the Nile]], the long-term use of [[biochar]], and use of crop and livestock [[landrace]]s that are adapted to less than ideal conditions such as pests, drought, or lack of nutrients.

For irrigation systems to be sustainable, they require proper management (to avoid [[Soil salinity|salinization]]) and must not use more water from their source than is naturally replenishable. Otherwise, the water source effectively becomes a [[non-renewable resource]]. Improvements in water [[well drilling]] technology and [[submersible pump]]s, combined with the development of [[drip irrigation]] and low-pressure pivots, have made it possible to regularly achieve high crop yields in areas where reliance on rainfall alone had previously made successful agriculture unpredictable. However, this progress has come at a price. In many areas, such as the [[Ogallala Aquifer]], the water is being used faster than it can be replenished.\n\nAccording to the UC Davis Agricultural Sustainability Institute, several steps must be taken to develop drought-resistant farming systems even in \"normal\" years with average rainfall.

Sustainable intensification encompasses specific agriculture methods that increase production and at the same time help improve environmental outcomes. The desired outcomes of the farm are achieved without the need for more land cultivation or destruction of natural habitat; the system performance is upgraded with no net environmental cost. Sustainable Intensification has become a priority for the United Nations. Sustainable intensification differs from prior intensification methods by specifically placing importance on broader environmental outcomes. By the year 2018; it was predicted in 100 nations a combined total of 163 million farms used sustainable intensification. The amount of agricultural land covered by this is 453 million ha of land. That amount of land is equal to 29% of farms worldwide.<ref>Pretty. J. (November 23, 2018). Intensification for redesigned and sustainable agriculture systems; http://science.sciencemag.org/content/362/6417/eaav0294/tab-pdf</ref> In light of concerns about [[food security]], [[human population]] growth and dwindling land suitable for agriculture, sustainable intensive farming practises are needed to maintain high [[crop yields]], while maintaining [[soil health]] and [[ecosystem services]]. The capacity for ecosystem services to be strong enough to allow a reduction in use of non-renewable inputs whilst maintaining or boosting yields has been the subject of much debate. Recent work in irrigated rice production system of east Asia has suggested that - in relation to pest management at least - promoting the ecosystem service of biological control using nectar plants can reduce the need for insecticides by 70% whilst delivering a 5% yield advantage compared with standard practice.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gurr |first1=Geoff M. |display-authors=etal |title=Multi-country evidence that crop diversification promotes ecological intensification of agriculture |journal=Nature Plants |date=2016 |volume=2 |issue=3 |page=16014 |doi=10.1038/nplants.2016.14 |pmid=27249349}}</ref>\n\n[[Vertical farming]] is a concept with the potential advantages of year-round production, isolation from pests and diseases, controllable resource recycling and reduced transportation costs.<ref name=Marks2014>{{Cite news |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22129524-100-vertical-farms-sprouting-all-over-the-world/ |title=Vertical farms sprouting all over the world |last=Marks |first=Paul |date=15 January 2014 |work=New Scientist|accessdate=8 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Water===\n[[Water efficiency]] can be improved by reducing the need for [[irrigation]] and using alternative methods.
