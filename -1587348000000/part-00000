As in 1945, the [[Baseball Writers' Association of America]] (BBWAA) voted by mail to select from recent players, and elected no one. Also, as in 1945, the Old Timers Committee responded by electing the biggest class yet, then 10 and now 11 people: [[Jesse Burkett]], [[Frank Chance]], [[Jack Chesbro]], [[Johnny Evers]], [[Clark Griffith]], [[Tommy McCarthy]], [[Joe McGinnity]], [[Eddie Plank]], [[Joe Tinker]], [[Rube Waddell]], and [[Ed Walsh]]. \n\nThe election of the 11 players was announced in April 1946.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/37158796/eleven_players_are_named_to_baseballs/ |title=Eleven Players Are Named to Baseball's Hall of Fame |first=Melville |last=Webb |newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] |page=21 |date=April 24, 1946 |accessdate=October 13, 2019 |via=newspapers.com}}</ref> At that time, Burkett, Evers, Griffith, Tinker, and Walsh were still living.

Afterward, the jurisdiction of the BBWAA was formally reduced to cover only players who retired during the last 25 years; for the 1947 election, those would be players active in 1922 and later. Perhaps the relatively narrow scope would help the writers concentrate their votes on a few candidates. To make certain, the rules for 1947 provided for a runoff ballot in case of no winner on the first ballot. Also, on December 3, 1946, the BBWAA limited voting to writers who had been members for at least 10 years.\n\n==BBWAA election==\nBecause the [[Baseball Writers' Association of America]] (BBWAA) had failed to elect any candidates in 1945, and had elected only one player since 1939, the previous delay of three years between elections had been eliminated in September 1945 by the Hall of Fame Committee, and annual elections restored. In response to the high number of candidates drawing votes in the [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1945#BBWAA election|1945 election]], a two-step ballot process was created to narrow the field for a final vote. The first ballot would proceed in the same manner as previous elections, with voters free to name any 10 candidates. However, there would be no possibility of any inductees being elected in this vote; instead, the top 20 candidates would proceed to a final ballot. In order for any candidate to be elected, at least 200 ballots would have to be cast in each phase of the election.\n\nIn addition to the field being narrowed in this manner, it was hoped that the absence of several previously popular candidates would clear the way for others; the [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1945#Selections|10 players]] elected by the Old-Timers Committee in 1945 had received 26% of the vote in the last BBWAA election, and had included seven of the top 16 candidates. It was hoped that the revised approach and reduced field of candidates would result in up to five new members of the Hall annually.\n\n===Nominating stage===\nMembers of the BBWAA again had the authority to select any players active in the 20th century (after 1900), provided they had not appeared in a major league game in 1945. Voters were instructed to cast votes for 10 candidates. The top 20 candidates would advance to the final ballot, but the vote totals from the first ballot would not be revealed until the second election was over.\n\nIn addition, the [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1945#Old-Timers Committee|Hall of Fame Committee]] had instituted a set of criteria for the voters to observe in completing their ballot; for each candidate, they were to take into consideration:\n#playing ability\n#integrity\n#sportsmanship\n#character\n#contribution to the team on which they played and to baseball in general.\n\nA total of 202 ballots were cast, with 1,948 individual votes for 76 specific candidates, an average of 9.64 per ballot; due to a tie for 20th place, the top 21 candidates (those who had received 39 or more votes) were announced on January 3, 1946, and advanced to the final ballot.\n\nEven following the previous year's election of several players from that era, the emphasis on the stars of the 1900s and 1910s \u2013 who many voters felt should be given priority \u2013 was again evident, although not quite at the levels seen previously. Only five of the top 14 candidates in the voting, and none of the top five, had seen any substantial play since 1917; only two of the top 26, and none of the top 19, had played their final season anytime between 1918 and 1933. Players who had been retired over 28 years\u201435 of the 76 named\u2014received 53% of the votes. No player received 75% of the vote in this stage; even if the rules had allowed a selection at this point, none would have occurred.\n\nIndividuals who were barred from baseball were still not officially ineligible. [[Shoeless Joe Jackson]] received two votes; this was the first time since 1937 that anyone who had been thrown out of baseball had received any votes, and it would be the last time any such candidate received any recognized votes. Candidates who have since been selected in subsequent elections are indicated in ''italics''; players selected by the Old-Timers Committee in 1946 are marked with an asterisk (*).\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break|width=50%}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

These individuals are also indicated in ''plain italics''.\n|}\n{{col-end}}\n\n===Final ballot===\nThe 21 final candidates were listed on the ballot in alphabetical order, as their vote totals in the first round had not been revealed. Because no more than five selections were desired at this time, voters were restricted to voting for their top five choices; this, of course, did not allow for the fact that candidates were less likely to be among a voter's top five choices than they were to be among his top ten, thus making any selections ''less'' probable than they otherwise might have been. A total of 263 ballots were cast, with 1318 individual votes for the 21 candidates; 198 votes were required for election. The results were announced on January 23, 1946.\n\nFor the second year in a row, no candidate gained the necessary number of votes, with none even coming within 40 of the required total. As might have been mathematically projected, every candidate got a ''lower'' percentage of the vote than they had received on the nomination ballot. As a result of the restriction to five choices, only four candidates received even half the necessary votes for election. Again, an emphasis on the earliest candidates was evident; the top six candidates were all retired by 1917, while the bottom four were all active in 1934 or later, with the eleven candidates who were retired over 23 years receiving 65% of the vote.\n\nThe continuing inability to elect anyone created an even greater clamor for radical revision of the selection method. Some suggested that perhaps a lower threshold than 75% was advisable; others proposed that the final ballot should include only ten names, with voters choosing the top five. The Hall of Fame Committee, meeting in April and again in December, found it necessary to again overhaul the election method.\n\nAll of the candidates on the ballot were elected by 1955, with the exception of manager Miller Huggins, who was elected in 1964.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

The committee firmly agreed that any flaws in the rules were causing errors of omission rather than ones of liberality in selections, and that the wide field of candidates from the entire 20th century was making it unlikely that any candidate could draw 75% of the vote from the BBWAA.\n\nThe committee members were: Hall of Fame president [[Stephen Carlton Clark|Stephen C. Clark]], who chaired the committee; Hall of Fame treasurer [[Paul S. Kerr]], the committee secretary; former Yankees president [[Ed Barrow]]; Athletics owner/manager [[Connie Mack]]; former Braves president [[Bob Quinn (baseball)|Bob Quinn]]; and Boston sportswriter Mel Webb. New York sportswriter [[Harry Cross (sportswriter)|Harry Cross]], who had been named in February to fill the vacancy created by the death of [[Sid Mercer]], also died, on April 4. On April 23, the members of the committee met in New York City to consider their selections and to make further revisions in the election process. In May, [[Grantland Rice]] was named to fill the vacancy on the committee, and another major revision in the BBWAA voting process was enacted at their meeting in December.\n\n===Selections===\nThe committee determined that the candidates from the early part of the century were gaining the most support, but would likely never reach the necessary threshold of 75% because many younger writers were reluctant to vote for players about whom they had limited first-hand knowledge. In 1945 the committee had believed that only a handful of those early candidates whose careers bridged the turn of the century needed to be removed from BBWAA consideration in order to facilitate elections; they were now more certain that they needed to select players whose careers ''began'' after 1900, and extended through the 1910s, in order to break the deadlock in the BBWAA voting. There was even some support on the committee from eliminating the BBWAA from the process entirely, due to their inability for several years to agree on appropriate inductees.\n\nThe committee selected 11 inductees \u2013 five of whom were still living \u2013 including the first two left-handed [[pitcher]]s to reach the Hall. They were formally inducted on July 21, [[1947 in sports|1947]], with National League president [[Ford Frick]] officiating; however, of the four still living at that time ([[Johnny Evers]] died in the interim), only Ed Walsh attended the ceremonies:\n\n*[[Jesse Burkett]], a left fielder who played primarily for Cleveland and St. Louis from 1890 to 1905; he compiled a .338 career [[Batting average (baseball)|batting average]], hitting over .400 twice and winning three batting titles. His 240 hits in 1896 stand as the 19th century record, and his 2850 career hits ranked behind only [[Cap Anson]]'s total upon his retirement. His ability to foul off pitches was a factor in baseball's move to count fouls as strikes. He later won four pennants as a minor league manager before coaching at [[College of the Holy Cross|Holy Cross]] and then becoming a scout for the [[New York Giants (baseball)|New York Giants]].\n*[[Frank Chance]], the first baseman and manager, known as the \"Peerless Leader\", of the great [[Chicago Cubs]] teams from 1898 to 1912. The team won four pennants in five seasons from 1906 to 1910, winning a record 116 games in 1906 for a .763 winning percentage. He was widely considered baseball's best right-handed first baseman, and remains the only player at that position to steal 400 bases. He later managed the Yankees and Red Sox, and had been hired to manage the White Sox before dying at age 47.\n*[[Jack Chesbro]], a spitball pitcher from 1899 to 1909, winning 198 games. His 41 wins in 1904 stand as the modern record, and he won over 20 three other times. He led both leagues once each in wins and winning percentage.\n*[[Johnny Evers]], the star second baseman on the Cubs and [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]] from 1902 to 1917, he was named the NL's Most Valuable Player in 1914 with the \"Miracle Braves.\" Arriving in the majors when he weighed under 100 pounds (45&nbsp;kg), he was consistently one of the sport's most dynamic figures, and his alertness helped capture the 1908 pennant with a famous defensive move. He was a manager or coach for four teams from 1920 to 1932, later working as a scout.\n*[[Clark Griffith]], a pitcher who won 237 games between 1891 and 1906, collecting over 20 wins seven times. He managed four teams from 1901 to 1920, winning the first AL pennant with the White Sox; he not only managed the [[Washington Senators (1901\u201360)|Washington Senators]] from 1912 to 1920, but became the majority owner of the team from 1919 until his death in 1955.\n*[[Tommy McCarthy]], an outfielder and excellent baserunner from 1884 to 1896 who played a notable role on the Boston teams of the early 1890s. Along with center fielder [[Hugh Duffy]], he was known as one of the \"Heavenly Twins\" for his defensive ability. He also played a part in developing important aspects of defensive strategy and team signals.\n*[[Joe McGinnity]], a pitcher from 1899 to 1908 who won over 20 games eight times, and over 30 twice. Known as \"Iron Man\" for his durability and stamina, he pitched complete double-headers five times, including three times in one month, and once won five games in six days. He won nearly 500 games in a professional career which lasted until he was in his fifties.\n*[[Eddie Plank]], a left-handed pitcher from 1901 to 1917, primarily with the [[Philadelphia Athletics]], he won 20 games eight times and was a mainstay of the pitching staff on six pennant winners. He was the first left-hander to win 200 games, and kept going until he finished with 326 victories \u2013 the most by a left-hander until 1962, and still the AL record.\n*[[Joe Tinker]], shortstop on the Cubs from 1902 to 1912 and a daring baserunner, later the player-manager of the Chicago [[Federal League]] team, winning that league's pennant in 1915. The defensive standout led the NL in fielding average four times. After retiring as a player, he became a minor league manager and executive, and a scout for the Cubs.\n*[[Rube Waddell]], a pitcher from 1897 to 1910, the unpredictable left-handed pitcher starred for the Athletics from 1902 to 1907; he set numerous strikeout records, leading the AL in each of his seasons with the A's and notching a record 349 in 1904. Out of the major leagues at 33, he died at the age of 37.\n*[[Ed Walsh]], a spitball pitcher from 1904 to 1917, almost all with the [[Chicago White Sox]], he peaked from 1906 to 1912 when he won 24 games or more four times, including 40 wins in 1908. His career [[Earned run average|ERA]] of 1.82 remains the lowest in major league history. He played a major role on the 1906 \"Hitless Wonders\" which won the World Series, and pitched a no-hitter in 1911. He was later an AL umpire for one year, and then coached the Sox for several seasons.\n\nThe committee had followed up on its intent to review most of the popular pitching candidates of the era, but took no further action on the candidacies, proposed [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1945#Other candidates|one year earlier]], of [[Abner Doubleday]] and [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Franklin Roosevelt]]. They also took no action on additional stars such as [[Deacon White|Jim \"Deacon\" White]] from the era before 1890, an area in which selections had continually been postponed.\n\n===Honor Rolls of Baseball===\n{{Main|Honor Rolls of Baseball}}\nThe Hall of Fame Committee also announced the creation of the [[Honor Rolls of Baseball]], which would be displayed at the museum, featuring the names of significant non-players in four areas. This second-tier list consisted of five managers, 11 umpires, 11 executives and 12 sportswriters. These contributors were not designated as official Hall of Fame members, so plaques on the wall were not authorized, as they were reserved only for those outstanding players, along with certain pioneers of the game.\n\nThe Honor Roll recognition was not meant to be a final destination for the selected writers, umpires, managers, and executives. The committee was clear that any of the men named to the Honor Rolls would be eligible for full admission into the Hall in the future, and eight of the 39 were later selected and inducted. Of the 39 honorees, eight were still living: Barrow, Carrigan, Connolly, Dinneen, Evans, Heydler, Klem, and Quinn.\n\n===Criticism and rationale===\nWhereas the committee's 1945 selections met with criticism only in later years, complaints regarding their moves in 1946 began more immediately. The committee had not yet outlined the revised voting rules for BBWAA elections, and many observers felt that the BBWAA's privilege of selecting 20th century players was being infringed. It was widely suggested that the committee should either reform the BBWAA's voting rules or eliminate the writers entirely from the process; it was also noted that there was still plenty of work for the committee in selecting further 19th century inductees. Criticism was also directed at the Roll of Honor, which had been created by the committee without any popular request; many felt that the Roll was a backhanded, secondary honor for individuals who had perhaps earned full membership in the Hall, and that the committee had simply established it as an excuse for inaction regarding non-playing candidates. It was further noted that managers ([[Connie Mack]]), executives ([[Ban Johnson]]), sportswriters ([[Henry Chadwick (writer)|Henry Chadwick]]) and pioneers ([[Alexander Cartwright]]) were already included among the Hall's members, indicating that it had not been intended as an honor solely for players. Probably as a result of this criticism, there were never any additions to the Roll of Honor.\n\nSpecific, individual criticism regarding the 11 inductees selected by the committee was not as immediate, although the choices included some which have come to be met with greater disapproval than any of the 1945 choices; McCarthy has been described as the worst player in the Hall of Fame.<ref name=\"james\">\n {{cite book\n | author = James, Bill\n | title = Whatever Happened to the Hall of Fame?\n | year = 1995\n | publisher = Free Press\n | location = New York\n | isbn = 0-684-80088-8\n }}</ref> Again, it is reasonably clear to discern the several factors which the committee likely found most important in making their selections in both 1945 and 1946:\n#The committee's primary focus in both years was dealing with the failure of two consecutive BBWAA elections. In helping to ease the BBWAA's task, they initially intended only to select popular candidates whose peak years were before 1905; but they later decided that clearing the BBWAA logjam would require that they forgo their earlier limitation to the 19th century, and cover the entire period before 1920. As a result, almost all of their 21 selections over the two years played in the 25-year period between [[1893 in sports|1893]] (when baseball moved the pitcher back 10 feet from the plate) and 1917; all of their selections were active players in 1893 or later, with 11 playing their entire careers within that span. Only 4 enjoyed their peak years before 1893, including 3 selected in 1945: [[Dan Brouthers]], [[King Kelly|Mike \"King\" Kelly]], [[Jim O'Rourke (baseball)|Jim O'Rourke]], and the newly added [[Tommy McCarthy]]. Fully 17 were active after 1900, and 7 were active after 1910.\n#The committee was selecting the most popular candidates from the BBWAA voting; had they instead selected players who received scant support from the BBWAA, they would have been far more heavily criticized for overriding the writers' judgment. With their selections over two years, they had chosen 15 of the 18 candidates who had retired by 1920 and who had received at least 10% of the vote in either year's election; every non-pitcher retired before 1920 who had ''ever'' received over 10% of the BBWAA vote had now been elected to the Hall or (in Miller Huggins' case) named to the Roll of Honor. [[Jesse Burkett]], also elected, was the only player retired before 1910 who received more than 1 vote in the 1946 election. 4 of the committee's other selections had retired before 1900 and were not eligible for BBWAA consideration. The BBWAA members who supported the selection of these inductees are more appropriate targets for criticism than the Old-Timers Committee, which was essentially confirming their votes; the committee elected the same candidates the BBWAA had been ''trying'' to elect.\n#Throughout this period, most voters and media observers supported the idea of choosing players who had remained in the sport as managers, coaches or executives after retiring. A majority of the selections were major league managers at some point, with eight leading their teams to pennants. Five of the inductees each served at least five seasons as coaches in the major leagues; Burkett and [[Hugh Duffy]] worked as scouts for several years. Every retired manager with over 1000 victories had now been either elected to the Hall or placed in the Roll of Honor. Here follow the names of the 21 managers who had won over 750 major league games prior to 1946, only 3 of whom were retired but had not yet received either recognition; those who had been selected by 1946 are shown in ''italics'':\n##''[[Connie Mack]]'' \u2013 3387 (active)\n##''[[John McGraw (baseball)|John McGraw]]'' \u2013 2763\n##[[Joe McCarthy (manager)|Joe McCarthy]] \u2013 1880 (active) (elected by Veterans Committee, 1957)\n##[[Bill McKechnie]] \u2013 1832 (active) (elected by Veterans Committee, 1962)\n##''[[Fred Clarke]]'' \u2013 1602\n##[[Bucky Harris]] \u2013 1456 (active) (elected by Veterans Committee, 1975)\n##''[[Clark Griffith]]'' \u2013 1491\n##[[Miller Huggins]] \u2013 1413 (Roll of Honor) (elected by Veterans Committee, 1964)\n##''[[Wilbert Robinson]]'' \u2013 1399\n##[[Ned Hanlon (baseball)|Ned Hanlon]] \u2013 1313 (Roll of Honor) (elected by Veterans Committee, 1996)\n##''[[Cap Anson]]'' \u2013 1292\n##[[Frank Selee]] \u2013 1284 (Roll of Honor) (elected by Veterans Committee, 1999)\n##''[[Hughie Jennings]]'' \u2013 1184\n##[[Joe Cronin]] \u2013 1049 (active) (elected by BBWAA, 1956)\n##[[Harry Wright]] \u2013 1000 (elected by Veterans Committee, 1953)\n##''[[Frank Chance]]'' \u2013 946\n##[[Frankie Frisch]] \u2013 935 (active) (elected by BBWAA, 1947)\n##[[Jimmy Dykes]] \u2013 889 (active)\n##[[George Stallings]] \u2013 879\n##''[[Charles Comiskey]]'' \u2013 839\n##[[Bill Terry]] \u2013 823 (elected by BBWAA, 1954)\n#The committee had elected players at positions which were not yet represented in the Hall. By 1945, the BBWAA had elected 20th century players at every position except [[catcher]], [[third baseman|third base]] and [[left fielder|left field]]; these omissions were corrected through the elections of [[Roger Bresnahan]], [[Jimmy Collins]], and [[Fred Clarke]] respectively. The 1946 selections of [[Eddie Plank]] and [[Rube Waddell]] corrected the absence of any left-handed pitchers.\n#There was a strong emphasis on those who had played central roles on championship teams, particularly the 3-time champion [[Baltimore Orioles (19th century)|Baltimore Orioles]] of 1894-95-96 (4 inducted members), and the powerhouse [[Chicago Cubs]] teams which won 4 pennants between 1906 and 1910 (3 inducted members). 16 of the 21 inductees had been regulars on a world championship team; all except Burkett and [[Ed Delahanty]] had played for a pennant winner. Of the 21 selections, 15 had been a starting player, manager or owner for at least three pennant winners.\n#The committee evidently chose to include players who had accomplished noteworthy feats in single seasons, particularly establishing single-season records ([[Jack Chesbro]], Duffy and Waddell), and winning multiple batting titles (Brouthers, Burkett, Delahanty).\n#The committee included groups of players who were closely associated with one another in baseball lore, such as Chicago's infield combination of [[Joe Tinker|Tinker]], [[Johnny Evers|Evers]] and [[Frank Chance|Chance]], and Boston's \"Heavenly Twins\" outfield in the early 1890s of Duffy and McCarthy.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120614051804/http://baseballhall.org/hall-famers/bbwaa-voting/year?year=1946 1946 Election] at www.baseballhalloffame\n\n{{Baseball Hall of Fame}}\n{{Honor Rolls of Baseball}}\n\n[[Category:Baseball Hall of Fame balloting]]\n[[Category:1946 in baseball]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=October 2019}}\n{{infobox <!-- one-off usage here -->\n| above          = <span style=\"color:white;\"><small>1946 Balloting for the National</small></span>\n| abovestyle     = background:#EC1C40;\n| subheaderstyle = background:{{{hofcolor|#184071}}};\n| subheader      = [[File:Empty Star.svg|15px|link=]] [[File:Empty Star.svg|15px|link=]] [[File:Empty Star.svg|15px|link=]] &nbsp;<span style=\"color:white;\">'''Baseball Hall of Fame'''</span>&nbsp; [[File:Empty Star.svg|15px|link=]] [[File:Empty Star.svg|15px|link=]] [[File:Empty Star.svg|15px|link=]]\n| image   = \n| caption =\n|label1= New inductees\n| data1 = 11\n|label2= via Old Timers Committee\n| data2 = 11\n|label3= Total inductees\n| data3 = 49\n|label4= Induction date\n| data4 = July 21, 1947\n| data5 = {{align|center|[[:Category:Baseball Hall of Fame balloting|Baseball Hall of Fame balloting]]}}\n| data6 = {{align|left|\u00ab[[1945 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting|1945]]}}{{align|right|[[1947 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting|1947]]\u00bb}}\n}}\n{{multiple image\n| footer    = Three of the players elected in 1946 (L-R): [[Joe Tinker]], [[Johnny Evers]], and [[Frank Chance]], the subject of \"[[Baseball's Sad Lexicon]]\"\n| align     = right\n| total_width=390\n| image1    = Joe Tinker (baseball card - 1912).jpg\n| image2    = John J.

As in 1945, the [[Baseball Writers' Association of America]] (BBWAA) voted by mail to select from recent players, and elected no one. Also, as in 1945, the Old Timers Committee responded by electing the biggest class yet, then 10 and now 11 people: [[Jesse Burkett]], [[Frank Chance]], [[Jack Chesbro]], [[Johnny Evers]], [[Clark Griffith]], [[Tommy McCarthy]], [[Joe McGinnity]], [[Eddie Plank]], [[Joe Tinker]], [[Rube Waddell]], and [[Ed Walsh]]. \n\nThe election of the 11 players was announced in April 1946.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/37158796/eleven_players_are_named_to_baseballs/ |title=Eleven Players Are Named to Baseball's Hall of Fame |first=Melville |last=Webb |newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] |page=21 |date=April 24, 1946 |accessdate=October 13, 2019 |via=newspapers.com}}</ref> At that time, Burkett, Evers, Griffith, Tinker, and Walsh were still living.

Afterward, the jurisdiction of the BBWAA was formally reduced to cover only players who retired during the last 25 years; for the 1947 election, those would be players active in 1922 and later. Perhaps the relatively narrow scope would help the writers concentrate their votes on a few candidates. To make certain, the rules for 1947 provided for a runoff ballot in case of no winner on the first ballot. Also, on December 3, 1946, the BBWAA limited voting to writers who had been members for at least 10 years.\n\n==BBWAA election==\nBecause the [[Baseball Writers' Association of America]] (BBWAA) had failed to elect any candidates in 1945, and had elected only one player since 1939, the previous delay of three years between elections had been eliminated in September 1945 by the Hall of Fame Committee, and annual elections restored. In response to the high number of candidates drawing votes in the [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1945#BBWAA election|1945 election]], a two-step ballot process was created to narrow the field for a final vote. The first ballot would proceed in the same manner as previous elections, with voters free to name any 10 candidates. However, there would be no possibility of any inductees being elected in this vote; instead, the top 20 candidates would proceed to a final ballot. In order for any candidate to be elected, at least 200 ballots would have to be cast in each phase of the election.\n\nIn addition to the field being narrowed in this manner, it was hoped that the absence of several previously popular candidates would clear the way for others; the [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1945#Selections|10 players]] elected by the Old-Timers Committee in 1945 had received 26% of the vote in the last BBWAA election, and had included seven of the top 16 candidates. It was hoped that the revised approach and reduced field of candidates would result in up to five new members of the Hall annually.\n\n===Nominating stage===\nMembers of the BBWAA again had the authority to select any players active in the 20th century (after 1900), provided they had not appeared in a major league game in 1945. Voters were instructed to cast votes for 10 candidates. The top 20 candidates would advance to the final ballot, but the vote totals from the first ballot would not be revealed until the second election was over.\n\nIn addition, the [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1945#Old-Timers Committee|Hall of Fame Committee]] had instituted a set of criteria for the voters to observe in completing their ballot; for each candidate, they were to take into consideration:\n#playing ability\n#integrity\n#sportsmanship\n#character\n#contribution to the team on which they played and to baseball in general.\n\nA total of 202 ballots were cast, with 1,948 individual votes for 76 specific candidates, an average of 9.64 per ballot; due to a tie for 20th place, the top 21 candidates (those who had received 39 or more votes) were announced on January 3, 1946, and advanced to the final ballot.\n\nEven following the previous year's election of several players from that era, the emphasis on the stars of the 1900s and 1910s \u2013 who many voters felt should be given priority \u2013 was again evident, although not quite at the levels seen previously. Only five of the top 14 candidates in the voting, and none of the top five, had seen any substantial play since 1917; only two of the top 26, and none of the top 19, had played their final season anytime between 1918 and 1933. Players who had been retired over 28 years\u201435 of the 76 named\u2014received 53% of the votes. No player received 75% of the vote in this stage; even if the rules had allowed a selection at this point, none would have occurred.\n\nIndividuals who were barred from baseball were still not officially ineligible. [[Shoeless Joe Jackson]] received two votes; this was the first time since 1937 that anyone who had been thrown out of baseball had received any votes, and it would be the last time any such candidate received any recognized votes. Candidates who have since been selected in subsequent elections are indicated in ''italics''; players selected by the Old-Timers Committee in 1946 are marked with an asterisk (*).\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break|width=50%}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

These individuals are also indicated in ''plain italics''.\n|}\n{{col-end}}\n\n===Final ballot===\nThe 21 final candidates were listed on the ballot in alphabetical order, as their vote totals in the first round had not been revealed. Because no more than five selections were desired at this time, voters were restricted to voting for their top five choices; this, of course, did not allow for the fact that candidates were less likely to be among a voter's top five choices than they were to be among his top ten, thus making any selections ''less'' probable than they otherwise might have been. A total of 263 ballots were cast, with 1318 individual votes for the 21 candidates; 198 votes were required for election. The results were announced on January 23, 1946.\n\nFor the second year in a row, no candidate gained the necessary number of votes, with none even coming within 40 of the required total. As might have been mathematically projected, every candidate got a ''lower'' percentage of the vote than they had received on the nomination ballot. As a result of the restriction to five choices, only four candidates received even half the necessary votes for election. Again, an emphasis on the earliest candidates was evident; the top six candidates were all retired by 1917, while the bottom four were all active in 1934 or later, with the eleven candidates who were retired over 23 years receiving 65% of the vote.\n\nThe continuing inability to elect anyone created an even greater clamor for radical revision of the selection method. Some suggested that perhaps a lower threshold than 75% was advisable; others proposed that the final ballot should include only ten names, with voters choosing the top five. The Hall of Fame Committee, meeting in April and again in December, found it necessary to again overhaul the election method.\n\nAll of the candidates on the ballot were elected by 1955, with the exception of manager Miller Huggins, who was elected in 1964.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

The committee firmly agreed that any flaws in the rules were causing errors of omission rather than ones of liberality in selections, and that the wide field of candidates from the entire 20th century was making it unlikely that any candidate could draw 75% of the vote from the BBWAA.\n\nThe committee members were: Hall of Fame president [[Stephen Carlton Clark|Stephen C. Clark]], who chaired the committee; Hall of Fame treasurer [[Paul S. Kerr]], the committee secretary; former Yankees president [[Ed Barrow]]; Athletics owner/manager [[Connie Mack]]; former Braves president [[Bob Quinn (baseball)|Bob Quinn]]; and Boston sportswriter Mel Webb. New York sportswriter [[Harry Cross (sportswriter)|Harry Cross]], who had been named in February to fill the vacancy created by the death of [[Sid Mercer]], also died, on April 4. On April 23, the members of the committee met in New York City to consider their selections and to make further revisions in the election process. In May, [[Grantland Rice]] was named to fill the vacancy on the committee, and another major revision in the BBWAA voting process was enacted at their meeting in December.\n\n===Selections===\nThe committee determined that the candidates from the early part of the century were gaining the most support, but would likely never reach the necessary threshold of 75% because many younger writers were reluctant to vote for players about whom they had limited first-hand knowledge. In 1945 the committee had believed that only a handful of those early candidates whose careers bridged the turn of the century needed to be removed from BBWAA consideration in order to facilitate elections; they were now more certain that they needed to select players whose careers ''began'' after 1900, and extended through the 1910s, in order to break the deadlock in the BBWAA voting. There was even some support on the committee from eliminating the BBWAA from the process entirely, due to their inability for several years to agree on appropriate inductees.\n\nThe committee selected 11 inductees \u2013 five of whom were still living \u2013 including the first two left-handed [[Pitcher|pitcher]]s to reach the Hall. They were formally inducted on July 21, [[1947 in sports|1947]], with National League president [[Ford Frick]] officiating; however, of the four still living at that time ([[Johnny Evers]] died in the interim), only Ed Walsh attended the ceremonies:\n\n*[[Jesse Burkett]], a left fielder who played primarily for Cleveland and St. Louis from 1890 to 1905; he compiled a .338 career [[Batting average (baseball)|batting average]], hitting over .400 twice and winning three batting titles. His 240 hits in 1896 stand as the 19th century record, and his 2850 career hits ranked behind only [[Cap Anson]]'s total upon his retirement. His ability to foul off pitches was a factor in baseball's move to count fouls as strikes. He later won four pennants as a minor league manager before coaching at [[College of the Holy Cross|Holy Cross]] and then becoming a scout for the [[New York Giants (baseball)|New York Giants]].\n*[[Frank Chance]], the first baseman and manager, known as the \"Peerless Leader\", of the great [[Chicago Cubs]] teams from 1898 to 1912. The team won four pennants in five seasons from 1906 to 1910, winning a record 116 games in 1906 for a .763 winning percentage. He was widely considered baseball's best right-handed first baseman, and remains the only player at that position to steal 400 bases. He later managed the Yankees and Red Sox, and had been hired to manage the White Sox before dying at age 47.\n*[[Jack Chesbro]], a spitball pitcher from 1899 to 1909, winning 198 games. His 41 wins in 1904 stand as the modern record, and he won over 20 three other times. He led both leagues once each in wins and winning percentage.\n*[[Johnny Evers]], the star second baseman on the Cubs and [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]] from 1902 to 1917, he was named the NL's Most Valuable Player in 1914 with the \"Miracle Braves.\" Arriving in the majors when he weighed under 100 pounds (45&nbsp;kg), he was consistently one of the sport's most dynamic figures, and his alertness helped capture the 1908 pennant with a famous defensive move. He was a manager or coach for four teams from 1920 to 1932, later working as a scout.\n*[[Clark Griffith]], a pitcher who won 237 games between 1891 and 1906, collecting over 20 wins seven times. He managed four teams from 1901 to 1920, winning the first AL pennant with the White Sox; he not only managed the [[Washington Senators (1901\u201360)|Washington Senators]] from 1912 to 1920, but became the majority owner of the team from 1919 until his death in 1955.\n*[[Tommy McCarthy]], an outfielder and excellent baserunner from 1884 to 1896 who played a notable role on the Boston teams of the early 1890s. Along with center fielder [[Hugh Duffy]], he was known as one of the \"Heavenly Twins\" for his defensive ability. He also played a part in developing important aspects of defensive strategy and team signals.\n*[[Joe McGinnity]], a pitcher from 1899 to 1908 who won over 20 games eight times, and over 30 twice. Known as \"Iron Man\" for his durability and stamina, he pitched complete double-headers five times, including three times in one month, and once won five games in six days. He won nearly 500 games in a professional career which lasted until he was in his fifties.\n*[[Eddie Plank]], a left-handed pitcher from 1901 to 1917, primarily with the [[Philadelphia Athletics]], he won 20 games eight times and was a mainstay of the pitching staff on six pennant winners. He was the first left-hander to win 200 games, and kept going until he finished with 326 victories \u2013 the most by a left-hander until 1962, and still the AL record.\n*[[Joe Tinker]], shortstop on the Cubs from 1902 to 1912 and a daring baserunner, later the player-manager of the Chicago [[Federal League]] team, winning that league's pennant in 1915. The defensive standout led the NL in fielding average four times. After retiring as a player, he became a minor league manager and executive, and a scout for the Cubs.\n*[[Rube Waddell]], a pitcher from 1897 to 1910, the unpredictable left-handed pitcher starred for the Athletics from 1902 to 1907; he set numerous strikeout records, leading the AL in each of his seasons with the A's and notching a record 349 in 1904. Out of the major leagues at 33, he died at the age of 37.\n*[[Ed Walsh]], a spitball pitcher from 1904 to 1917, almost all with the [[Chicago White Sox]], he peaked from 1906 to 1912 when he won 24 games or more four times, including 40 wins in 1908. His career [[Earned run average|ERA]] of 1.82 remains the lowest in major league history. He played a major role on the 1906 \"Hitless Wonders\" which won the World Series, and pitched a no-hitter in 1911. He was later an AL umpire for one year, and then coached the Sox for several seasons.\n\nThe committee had followed up on its intent to review most of the popular pitching candidates of the era, but took no further action on the candidacies, proposed [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1945#Other candidates|one year earlier]], of [[Abner Doubleday]] and [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Franklin Roosevelt]]. They also took no action on additional stars such as [[Deacon White|Jim \"Deacon\" White]] from the era before 1890, an area in which selections had continually been postponed.\n\n===Honor Rolls of Baseball===\n{{Main|Honor Rolls of Baseball}}\nThe Hall of Fame Committee also announced the creation of the [[Honor Rolls of Baseball]], which would be displayed at the museum, featuring the names of significant non-players in four areas. This second-tier list consisted of five managers, 11 umpires, 11 executives and 12 sportswriters. These contributors were not designated as official Hall of Fame members, so plaques on the wall were not authorized, as they were reserved only for those outstanding players, along with certain pioneers of the game.\n\nThe Honor Roll recognition was not meant to be a final destination for the selected writers, umpires, managers, and executives. The committee was clear that any of the men named to the Honor Rolls would be eligible for full admission into the Hall in the future, and eight of the 39 were later selected and inducted. Of the 39 honorees, eight were still living: Barrow, Carrigan, Connolly, Dinneen, Evans, Heydler, Klem, and Quinn.\n\n===Criticism and rationale===\nWhereas the committee's 1945 selections met with criticism only in later years, complaints regarding their moves in 1946 began more immediately. The committee had not yet outlined the revised voting rules for BBWAA elections, and many observers felt that the BBWAA's privilege of selecting 20th century players was being infringed. It was widely suggested that the committee should either reform the BBWAA's voting rules or eliminate the writers entirely from the process; it was also noted that there was still plenty of work for the committee in selecting further 19th century inductees. Criticism was also directed at the Roll of Honor, which had been created by the committee without any popular request; many felt that the Roll was a backhanded, secondary honor for individuals who had perhaps earned full membership in the Hall, and that the committee had simply established it as an excuse for inaction regarding non-playing candidates. It was further noted that managers ([[Connie Mack]]), executives ([[Ban Johnson]]), sportswriters ([[Henry Chadwick (writer)|Henry Chadwick]]) and pioneers ([[Alexander Cartwright]]) were already included among the Hall's members, indicating that it had not been intended as an honor solely for players. Probably as a result of this criticism, there were never any additions to the Roll of Honor.\n\nSpecific, individual criticism regarding the 11 inductees selected by the committee was not as immediate, although the choices included some which have come to be met with greater disapproval than any of the 1945 choices; McCarthy has been described as the worst player in the Hall of Fame.<ref name=\"james\">\n {{cite book\n | author = James, Bill\n | title = Whatever Happened to the Hall of Fame?\n | year = 1995\n | publisher = Free Press\n | location = New York\n | isbn = 0-684-80088-8\n }}</ref> Again, it is reasonably clear to discern the several factors which the committee likely found most important in making their selections in both 1945 and 1946:\n#The committee's primary focus in both years was dealing with the failure of two consecutive BBWAA elections. In helping to ease the BBWAA's task, they initially intended only to select popular candidates whose peak years were before 1905; but they later decided that clearing the BBWAA logjam would require that they forgo their earlier limitation to the 19th century, and cover the entire period before 1920. As a result, almost all of their 21 selections over the two years played in the 25-year period between [[1893 in sports|1893]] (when baseball moved the pitcher back 10 feet from the plate) and 1917; all of their selections were active players in 1893 or later, with 11 playing their entire careers within that span. Only 4 enjoyed their peak years before 1893, including 3 selected in 1945: [[Dan Brouthers]], [[King Kelly|Mike \"King\" Kelly]], [[Jim O'Rourke (baseball)|Jim O'Rourke]], and the newly added [[Tommy McCarthy]]. Fully 17 were active after 1900, and 7 were active after 1910.\n#The committee was selecting the most popular candidates from the BBWAA voting; had they instead selected players who received scant support from the BBWAA, they would have been far more heavily criticized for overriding the writers' judgment. With their selections over two years, they had chosen 15 of the 18 candidates who had retired by 1920 and who had received at least 10% of the vote in either year's election; every non-pitcher retired before 1920 who had ''ever'' received over 10% of the BBWAA vote had now been elected to the Hall or (in Miller Huggins' case) named to the Roll of Honor. [[Jesse Burkett]], also elected, was the only player retired before 1910 who received more than 1 vote in the 1946 election. 4 of the committee's other selections had retired before 1900 and were not eligible for BBWAA consideration. The BBWAA members who supported the selection of these inductees are more appropriate targets for criticism than the Old-Timers Committee, which was essentially confirming their votes; the committee elected the same candidates the BBWAA had been ''trying'' to elect.\n#Throughout this period, most voters and media observers supported the idea of choosing players who had remained in the sport as managers, coaches or executives after retiring. A majority of the selections were major league managers at some point, with eight leading their teams to pennants. Five of the inductees each served at least five seasons as coaches in the major leagues; Burkett and [[Hugh Duffy]] worked as scouts for several years. Every retired manager with over 1000 victories had now been either elected to the Hall or placed in the Roll of Honor. Here follow the names of the 21 managers who had won over 750 major league games prior to 1946, only 3 of whom were retired but had not yet received either recognition; those who had been selected by 1946 are shown in ''italics'':\n##''[[Connie Mack]]'' \u2013 3387 (active)\n##''[[John McGraw (baseball)|John McGraw]]'' \u2013 2763\n##[[Joe McCarthy (manager)|Joe McCarthy]] \u2013 1880 (active) (elected by Veterans Committee, 1957)\n##[[Bill McKechnie]] \u2013 1832 (active) (elected by Veterans Committee, 1962)\n##''[[Fred Clarke]]'' \u2013 1602\n##[[Bucky Harris]] \u2013 1456 (active) (elected by Veterans Committee, 1975)\n##''[[Clark Griffith]]'' \u2013 1491\n##[[Miller Huggins]] \u2013 1413 (Roll of Honor) (elected by Veterans Committee, 1964)\n##''[[Wilbert Robinson]]'' \u2013 1399\n##[[Ned Hanlon (baseball)|Ned Hanlon]] \u2013 1313 (Roll of Honor) (elected by Veterans Committee, 1996)\n##''[[Cap Anson]]'' \u2013 1292\n##[[Frank Selee]] \u2013 1284 (Roll of Honor) (elected by Veterans Committee, 1999)\n##''[[Hughie Jennings]]'' \u2013 1184\n##[[Joe Cronin]] \u2013 1049 (active) (elected by BBWAA, 1956)\n##[[Harry Wright]] \u2013 1000 (elected by Veterans Committee, 1953)\n##''[[Frank Chance]]'' \u2013 946\n##[[Frankie Frisch]] \u2013 935 (active) (elected by BBWAA, 1947)\n##[[Jimmy Dykes]] \u2013 889 (active)\n##[[George Stallings]] \u2013 879\n##''[[Charles Comiskey]]'' \u2013 839\n##[[Bill Terry]] \u2013 823 (elected by BBWAA, 1954)\n#The committee had elected players at positions which were not yet represented in the Hall. By 1945, the BBWAA had elected 20th century players at every position except [[catcher]], [[third baseman|third base]] and [[left fielder|left field]]; these omissions were corrected through the elections of [[Roger Bresnahan]], [[Jimmy Collins]], and [[Fred Clarke]] respectively. The 1946 selections of [[Eddie Plank]] and [[Rube Waddell]] corrected the absence of any left-handed pitchers.\n#There was a strong emphasis on those who had played central roles on championship teams, particularly the 3-time champion [[Baltimore Orioles (19th century)|Baltimore Orioles]] of 1894-95-96 (4 inducted members), and the powerhouse [[Chicago Cubs]] teams which won 4 pennants between 1906 and 1910 (3 inducted members). 16 of the 21 inductees had been regulars on a world championship team; all except Burkett and [[Ed Delahanty]] had played for a pennant winner. Of the 21 selections, 15 had been a starting player, manager or owner for at least three pennant winners.\n#The committee evidently chose to include players who had accomplished noteworthy feats in single seasons, particularly establishing single-season records ([[Jack Chesbro]], Duffy and Waddell), and winning multiple batting titles (Brouthers, Burkett, Delahanty).\n#The committee included groups of players who were closely associated with one another in baseball lore, such as Chicago's infield combination of [[Joe Tinker|Tinker]], [[Johnny Evers|Evers]] and [[Frank Chance|Chance]], and Boston's \"Heavenly Twins\" outfield in the early 1890s of Duffy and McCarthy.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120614051804/http://baseballhall.org/hall-famers/bbwaa-voting/year?year=1946 1946 Election] at www.baseballhalloffame\n\n{{Baseball Hall of Fame}}\n{{Honor Rolls of Baseball}}\n\n[[Category:Baseball Hall of Fame balloting]]\n[[Category:1946 in baseball]]\n", "name_user": "Jcoolbro", "label": "safe", "comment": "v2.02 -WP:WCWproject (Link equal to linktext)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1946_Baseball_Hall_of_Fame_balloting"}

Many works that are now considered [[western canon|classic]]s dealt with controversial themes and harshly criticized societal norms. Early examples include the scandalous writing of the [[Marquis de Sade]] and the [[Comte de Lautr\u00e9amont]]'s ''[[Les Chants de Maldoror]]'' (1869). [[French literature|French]] author [[\u00c9mile Zola]]'s works about social conditions and \"bad behavior\" are examples, as are [[Russia]]n [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]'s novels ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'' (1866) and ''[[Notes from Underground]]'' (1864) and [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[Knut Hamsun]]'s psychologically-driven ''[[Hunger (Hamsun novel)|Hunger]]'' (1890). Sexual extravagance can be seen in two of the earliest European novels, the ''[[Satyricon]]'' and ''[[The Golden Ass]]'', and also (with disclaimers) ''[[Moll Flanders]]'' and some of the excesses of early [[Gothic fiction]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe early development of the genre was anticipated in the work of early [[20th century]] writers such as [[Octave Mirbeau]], [[Georges Bataille]], and [[Arthur Schnitzler]], who explored [[psychosexual development]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nOn 6 December 1933, US federal judge John M. Woolsey overturned the federal ban on [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''. The book was banned in the US due to what the government claimed was obscenity, specifically parts of Molly Bloom's \"soliloquy\" at the end of the book. [[Random House Inc.]] challenged the claim of obscenity in federal court and was granted permission to print the book in the US. Judge Woolsey's explanation for his removal of the ban is often quoted: \"It is only with the normal person that the law is concerned.\"{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nIn the late 1950s, [[United States of America|American]] publisher [[Grove Press]], under publisher [[Barney Rosset]], began releasing decades-old novels that had been unpublished in most of the [[English language|English]]-speaking world for many years due to controversial subject matter. Two of these works, ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'' ([[D. H. Lawrence]]'s tale of an [[upper class]] woman's affair with a [[working class]] man) and ''[[Tropic of Cancer (novel)|Tropic of Cancer]]'' ([[Henry Miller]]'s sexual odyssey), were the subject of landmark obscenity trials (''Lady Chatterley's Lover'' was also tried in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and [[Austria]]). Both books were ruled not obscene and forced the US courts to weigh the [[literary merit|merit of literature]] that would have once been instantly deemed [[pornographic]] (see [[Miller test]]). Similarly, the author [[Vladimir Nabokov]] published ''[[Lolita]]'' in 1955 to a great deal of controversy due to the [[hebephilia]] that occurs between the book's main characters, Humbert Humbert and Lolita. The transgressive nature of this subject has made Lolita a book often found on the [[list of books banned by governments]] and the [[list of most commonly challenged books in the United States]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nGrove Press also published the explicit works of [[Beat generation|Beat]] writers, which led to two more obscenity trials. The first concerned ''[[Howl]]'', [[Allen Ginsberg]]'s 1955 poem which celebrated American [[counterculture]] and decried hypocrisy and emptiness in mainstream society. The second concerned [[William S. Burroughs]]' hallucinatory, [[satire|satirical]] novel ''[[Naked Lunch]]'' (1959). Both works contained what were considered lewd descriptions of body parts and sexual <!--what's \"idesexual\"? (often [[wikt:idesexual|idesexual]])--> acts. Grove also published [[Hubert Selby Jr.]]'s anecdotal novel ''[[Last Exit to Brooklyn]]'' (1964), known for its gritty portrayals of criminals, [[prostitute]]s, and [[transvestism|transvestites]] and its crude, slang-inspired prose. ''Last Exit to Brooklyn'' was tried as obscene in the UK. Grove Press won all these trials, and the victories paved the way both for transgressive fiction to be published legally, as well as bringing attention to these works.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nIn the 1970s and '80s, an entire underground of transgressive fiction flourished. Its biggest stars included [[J.G. Ballard]], a British writer known for his strange and frightening [[dystopia]]n novels; [[Kathy Acker]], an American known for her [[sex-positive feminism|sex-positive feminist]] fiction; and [[Charles Bukowski]], an American known for his tales of womanizing, drinking, and gambling. The notorious [[A Clockwork Orange (film)|1971 film version]] of [[Anthony Burgess]]'s ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]'', contained scenes of rape and \"ultraviolence\" by a futuristic youth gang complete with its own [[Nadsat|argot]], and was [[List of cultural references to A Clockwork Orange|a major influence on popular culture]]; it was subsequently withdrawn in the UK, and heavily censored in the US.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nIn the 1990s, the rise of [[alternative rock]] and its distinctly downbeat subculture opened the door for transgressive writers to become more influential and commercially successful than ever before.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} This is exemplified by the influence of [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[Douglas Coupland]]'s 1990 novel ''[[Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture]]'', which explored the economically-bleak and [[apocalypse]]-fixated worldview of Coupland's age group. The novel popularized the term [[generation X]] to describe this age demographic. Other influential authors of this decade include [[Bret Easton Ellis]], known for novels about depraved [[yuppie]]s; [[Irvine Welsh]], known for his portrayals of [[Scotland]]'s drug-addicted working class youth; and [[Chuck Palahniuk]], known for his characters' bizarre attempts to escape bland [[consumerism|consumer culture]].

Ronald's novels ''The Elephant Tree'' and ''The Zombie Room'' are based in the fictional city of Garden Heights, providing a fresh, contemporary melting pot to showcase the amalgamation of UK and US cultural and societal dissatisfaction and frustration, that had previously been portrayed very differently.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nIn the UK, the genre owes a considerable influence to \"[[working class]] literature\",{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} which often portrays characters trying to escape poverty by inventive means, while in the US, the genre focuses more on [[middle class]] characters trying to escape the emotional and spiritual limitations of their lifestyle.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nDue to a surge in popularity in the 21st century [https://transgressivefiction.info Transgressive Fiction] now has a central hub celebrating authors and books from past classics to contemporary masterpieces.\n\n==Notable works==\n'''[[William S.

{"title_page": "Gender and religion", "text_new": "{{refimprove|date=October 2019}}\nSex differences in religion can be classified as either \"internal\" or \"external\". Internal religious issues are studied from the perspective of a given religion, and might include religious beliefs and practices about the roles and rights of men and women in government, education and worship; beliefs about the [[sex or gender]] of deities and religious figures; and beliefs about the origin and meaning of human gender. External religious issues can be broadly defined as an examination of a given religion from an outsider's perspective, including possible clashes between religious leaders and laity;<ref>Juschka, Darlene. \"Gender.\" In ed. J. Hinnels. The Routledge Companion to the Study of Religion. 2nd ed.  New York: Routledge, 2010:245-258.</ref> and the influence of, and differences between, religious perspectives on social issues. \n\n== Gender of deities ==\n{{Main|Gender of God}}\n\nThe earliest documented religions, and some contemporary [[Animism|animist religions]], involve the deification of characteristics of the natural world. These spirits are typically, but not always, gendered. It has been proposed, since the 19th century, that [[polytheism]] arose out of animism, as [[religious epic]] provided personalities to [[Autochthon (ancient Greece)|autochthonous]] animist spirits in various parts of the world, notably in the development of [[Ancient Near East|ancient near eastern]] and [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] literature. Polytheistic gods are also typically gendered. The earliest evidence of [[monotheism]] is the worship of the goddess [[Eurynome]], [[Aten]] in Egypt, the teaching of [[Moses]] in the [[Torah]] and [[Zoroastrianism]] in [[Persia]]. [[Aten]], [[Yahweh]] and [[Ahura Mazda]] are all masculine deities, embodied only in metaphor, so masculine rather than reproductively male.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe Hindu goddess, Kali, breaks the gender role of women representing love, sex, fertility, and beauty because she is the goddess of both the life cycle and destructive war. An example of the typical female goddess is Aphrodite, who is shown as vain, simple, and beautiful.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\nIn [[Christianity]], one entity of the Trinity, the Son, is believed to have become incarnate as a human male. Christians have traditionally believed that God the Father has masculine gender rather than male sex because the Father has never been incarnated. By contrast, there is less historical consensus on the [[gender of the Holy Spirit]]. Islam, on the other hand, has a tradition that the name Allah, like its referent, can be allocated neither grammatical nor natural gender. Masculine pronouns for Allah in the [[Qur'an]] are interpreted as generic.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\n== Creation myths about human gender ==\nIn\\ ass\n\n\nand that [[woman|women]] as well as [[man|men]] are included in [[Image of God|God's image]]. The first man, Adam, has been viewed as a spiritual being or an ideal who can be distinguished as  both male and female; an androgynous being with no sex.<ref>Boyarin, Daniel. \"Gender.\" In ed. M.C. Taylor. Critical Terms for Religious Studies. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1998: 120.</ref> [[Pierre Chaunu]] argues that [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]' gender-inclusive conception of humanity contrasts sharply with the views of gender found in older [[literature]] from surrounding [[culture]]s, and suggests a higher [[Social status|status]] of women in [[western society]] due to Jud\u00e6o-Christian influence, and based on this [[Chapters and verses of the Bible|verse]].<ref name=\"Chaunu\" /> Some scholars, such as Philo, argue that the \"sexes\" were developed through an accidental division of the \"true self\" which existed prior to being assigned with gender.<ref>Boyarin, 120.</ref>\n\nIn other accounts, man is created first, followed by woman. This is the case in the creation account of Genesis 2, where the first woman (Eve) is created from the [[rib]] of the first man (Adam), as a companion and helper.<ref name=\"Genesis 2\">{{bibleref|Genesis|2:18}}</ref>  There is an interesting correlation between the two gender creation stories, both stories imagine the ideal of the unitary self. However, the unitary self is either androgynous or physically male; both of which are masculine in configuration. Thus male and female are to become one; meaning that she is to become male.<ref>Boyarin, 124.</ref>{{clarify|date=October 2019}}\n\nIn [[Plato]]'s [[Symposium (Plato)|''Symposium'']], [[Aristophanes]] provides an account to explain gender and romantic attraction.<ref>Richard L.

The identity of the [[Vedic]] writers is not known, but the first hymn of the [[Rigveda]] is addressed to the masculine deity [[Agni]], and the pantheon of the Vedas is dominated by masculine gods. The most prominent [[Avatar]]s of [[Vishnu]] are men.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\nMostly, the traditional religious leaders of [[Jainism]] are men.

[[John the Baptist]], [[Jesus]] and his apostles, and [[Saul of Tarsus]] again give the [[New Testament]] an impression of the founders and key figures of Christianity being male dominated. They were followed by a millennium of theologians known as the [[Church Fathers]]. [[Islam]] was founded by [[Muhammad]], and his successor [[Abu Bakr]], [[Umar]], [[Uthman ibn Affan]] and [[Ali]], for Sunnis and [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]] and [[The Twelve Imams]] for those of Shia faith, were also men. On the other hand, [[The Virgin Mary]], the mother of [[Jesus]] of Nazareth, is not associated with leadership or teaching, but is nonetheless a key figure in Catholicism. [[Fatimah]], daughter of Muhammad is regarded by Muslims as an exemplar for men and women.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith]], a [[Growth of religion#Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith|fast growing religion]], teaches that men and women are equal. Prominent women celebrated in Bah\u00e1'\u00ed history include [[Bahiyyih Kh\u00e1num]], who acted head of the faith for several periods during the ministries of [[`Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1]] and [[Shoghi Effendi]], and [[T\u00e1hirih]], who is also held by Bah\u00e1'\u00eds as a penultimate leader. Women serve in higher percentages of leadership in appointed and elected national and international institutions of the religion than in the general population.

More traditional or 'right wing' Modern Orthodox Judaism, and all forms of [[Haredi Judaism]], requires the ''mechitza'' to be of a type which absolutely prevents the men from seeing the women.\n\n[[Enclosed religious orders]] are usually segregated by gender.\n\n[[Sex segregation and Islam|Sex segregation in Islam]] includes restrictions on interaction between men and women.  Men and women also worship separately in most [[mosque]]s. According to the Quran, women are not permitted to enter the mosque unless they cover their hair with hijabs and their bodies with modest clothing. Additionally, they are not to wear perfume, nail polish, or any other things that can cause sexual distress to men. For this reason, women pray behind men or in separate rooms from men in order to avoid causing sexual distress to them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://islamqa.info/en/49898|title=Conditions of women going out to the mosque - islamqa.info|publisher=islamqa.info}}</ref>\n\n== Roles in marriage ==\nNearly all religions recognize [[marriage]], and many religions also promote views on appropriate [[gender role]]s within marriage. Within Christianity, two notable views on gender roles in marriage are [[complementarianism]] and [[Egalitarianism#Religious and spiritual egalitarianism|egalitarianism]].\n\nIn Genesis 3, Adam named his wife Eve (\"life\") because she \"was the mother of all living\" ({{bibleref|Genesis|3:20|9}}).\n\n=== Christianity ===\n\nThe complementarian view of marriage is widely accepted in Christianity, the husband viewed as the leader and wife viewed as the follower.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/church-history/article/what-would-jesus-do-sexuality-and-salvation-in-protestant-evangelical-sex-manuals-1950s-to-the-present/A0D3B75DDB5D49ADB5E65D2725F72C20|title=What Would Jesus Do?

In the case of a Tal\u0101q, which is a divorce initiated by the man, the man is supposed to announce the words \"I divorce you\" aloud three times, each separated by a three-month waiting period. Certain practices of the Tal\u0101q divorce allows the \"I divorce you\" utterance to be completed in one sitting; however, the concept of \"Triple Divorce\" in one sitting is considered wrong in some branches of Islam such as with the Shia Muslims. During the three-month waiting period, only the man has the right to initiate a marital reunion if both sides desire to reconcile. This yields a gender equality perspective in the sense that women have power over men in regards to finance parallel to how men have power over women in regards to obedience, both of which are only valid to a reasonable extent. While a \u1e6cal\u0101q can be completed easily, a divorce that is initiated by the woman, called a Khula, is harder to obtain due to a woman's requirement to repay her dowry and give up child custody. More specifically, a woman is to give up custody of her child if the child is over the age of seven. If a woman gains custody of her child who is under the age of seven, she must still forfeit custody upon the child's seventh birthday. Although the Islamic religion requires the woman to repay her dowry, she is also entitled to receive financial support from her former husband if needed. This cycle of financial matters protects the woman's property from being taken advantage of during or after marriage.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://wmlawandpractice.com/2011/04/11/women%e2%80%99s-rights-in-islam-regarding-marriage-and-divorce/ | title=Women's Rights In Islam Regarding Marriage And Divorce | date=April 11, 2011 | accessdate=August 23, 2016 | author=Imani Jaafar-Mohammad, Esq.|author2=Charlie Lehmann|work=William Mitchell Journal of Law and Practice}}</ref>\n\n== Cultural effects on religious practice ==\nReligious worship may vary by individual due to differing cultural experiences of gender.\n\n=== Greco-Roman Paganism ===\nBoth men and women who practiced paganism in ancient civilizations such as Rome and Greece worshiped male and female deities, but goddesses played a much larger role in women's lives. Roman and Greek goddesses' domains often aligned with culturally specific gender expectations at the time which served to perpetrate them in many cases. One such expectation of women was to marry at a relatively young age. The quadrennial Bear Festival, known as Arkteia, was held on the outskirts of Athens in honor of Artemis and involved girls ages seven to fourteen. The girls would compete in public athletic events as Greek men sat as onlookers, observing potential wives.<ref name=\":0\">Kraemer, Ross Shepard.

He points out, for example, in his book ''Foi et histoire'' (Faith and History, 1980), that it is only in those cultures where the biblical text and Christianity have had some long term influence, that the status of women has gradually improved from that of property and progenitor to that of a full human being, equal to man. In cultures where the biblical text has not had any significant impact, women are regarded as property whose main purpose is to produce children. In such cultures, women are married as soon as they are able to procreate, they have little or no access to formal education, and they are allowed little self-determination. The main reason behind this social transformation is fundamentally linked to a statement found in Genesis 1:27: 'God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.' This text affirms the intrinsic dignity of both men and women regardless of their gender or social status. This is in stark contrast to ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia where the value of human beings was primarily determined on the basis of their social standing.\" Pierre Gilbert, ''How the Bible Shapes Our World''</ref>\n\n[[Priyamvada Gopal]], of [[Churchill College, Cambridge]], argues that increased gender equality is indeed a product of Judeo-Christian doctrine, but not ''exclusive'' to it. She expresses concern that gender equality is used by western countries as a rationale for \"[[neocolonialism]]\".<ref>\"The insistence that equality is a western concept to be defended against the incursions of others relies on a continued deafness to resistant voices from outside Judaeo-Christian contexts. This, ironically, makes the self-proclaimed liberals who insist on this useful collaborators for authoritarian chauvinists from outside the west. For they are all in curious agreement that women's equality is a western concept and call for it, accordingly, to be either enforced (that's why we sent in the troops) or rejected (by keeping women secluded).\" Priyamvada Gopal, \"[http://www.kuwaittimes.net/read_news.php?newsid=ODYyODgyODA= West has no monopoly on battle for gender equality] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612155056/http://www.kuwaittimes.net/read_news.php?newsid=ODYyODgyODA= |date=June 12, 2010 }}\", ''[[Kuwait Times]]'' September 30, 2007.</ref> Jamaine Abidogun argues that Judeo-Christian influence has indeed shaped gender roles in Nigeria (a strongly Christianised country); however, she doesn't consider feminism to be a product of Judeo-Christian doctrine, but rather a preferable form of \"neocolonialism\".<ref>\"These perceptions demonstrate a pattern of gender roles shaped by Western Judeo-Christian doctrine within the formal education curriculum, minimal inclusion of local history or cultural content, and loss of indigenous knowledge and practices.

In 1997, statistics gathered by Beit-Hallahmi and Argyle theorized this phenomenon into three primary causes. The first explanation is that women feel emotions at greater heights than men do, thus women tend to turn to religion more in times of high emotions such as gratitude or guilt. The second explanation is that female socialization is more likely to align with values that are commonly found in religion such as conflict mediation, tenderness, and humility. In contrast, male socialization is more likely to emphasize rebellion, thus making the guideline aspects of religion less appealing. The third explanation, which is also the most recent theory, is that females are more likely to be able to identify with religion as a natural consequence of societal structures. For example, since a majority of religions emphasize women as caretakers of the home, the societal expectation of women to take greater responsibility than men for the upbringing of a child makes religion an appealing commitment. Another example is that traditionally, men tend to work outside the home whereas women tend to work inside the home, which corresponds to studies that have shown that people are more likely to be religious when working inside of their homes.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=2095292|title=Gender Differences in Religion: A Test of the Structural Location Theory|first1=David|last1=de Vaus|first2=Ian|last2=McAllister|date=1 January 1987|publisher=|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=52|issue=4|pages=472\u2013481|doi=10.2307/2095292}}</ref>\n\n== Specific religions ==\nMore information on the role of gender in specific religions can be found on the following pages:\n\n* [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith]] \u2013 [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith and gender equality]]\n* [[Buddhism]] \u2013 [[Women in Buddhism]]\n* [[Christianity]] \u2013 [[Women in Christianity]]\n** [[Mormonism]] \u2013 [[Women and Mormonism]]\n* [[Hinduism]] \u2013 [[Women in Hinduism]]\n* [[Islam]] \u2013 [[Women in Islam]]\n* [[Judaism]] \u2013 [[Gender and Judaism]], [[Women in Judaism]]\n* [[Sikhism]] \u2013 [[Women in Sikhism]]\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Religion and sexuality]]\n*[[Sex segregation]]\n*[[Transgender people and religion]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commonscat}}\n*[http://www.artofmanliness.com/2016/08/08/is-christianity-an-inherently-feminine-religion/ Is Christianity an Inherently Feminine Religion?] Brett and Kate McKay\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070202085205/http://www.atheistfoundation.org.au/womenbible.htm Women in the Bible] by the Atheist Foundation of Australia Inc.\n\n{{Human group differences}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gender And Religion}}\n[[Category:Gender and religion| ]]\n[[Category:Feminism and spirituality]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=October 2019}}\nSex differences in religion can be classified as either \"internal\" or \"external\".

These spirits are typically, but not always, gendered. It has been proposed, since the 19th century, that [[polytheism]] arose out of animism, as [[religious epic]] provided personalities to [[Autochthon (ancient Greece)|autochthonous]] animist spirits in various parts of the world, notably in the development of [[Ancient Near East|ancient near eastern]] and [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] literature. Polytheistic gods are also typically gendered. The earliest evidence of [[monotheism]] is the worship of the goddess [[Eurynome]], [[Aten]] in Egypt, the teaching of [[Moses]] in the [[Torah]] and [[Zoroastrianism]] in [[Persia]]. [[Aten]], [[Yahweh]] and [[Ahura Mazda]] are all masculine deities, embodied only in metaphor, so masculine rather than reproductively male.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe Hindu goddess, Kali, breaks the gender role of women representing love, sex, fertility, and beauty because she is the goddess of both the life cycle and destructive war. An example of the typical female goddess is Aphrodite, who is shown as vain, simple, and beautiful.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\nIn [[Christianity]], one entity of the Trinity, the Son, is believed to have become incarnate as a human male. Christians have traditionally believed that God the Father has masculine gender rather than male sex because the Father has never been incarnated. By contrast, there is less historical consensus on the [[gender of the Holy Spirit]]. Islam, on the other hand, has a tradition that the name Allah, like its referent, can be allocated neither grammatical nor natural gender. Masculine pronouns for Allah in the [[Qur'an]] are interpreted as generic.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\n== Creation myths about human gender ==\nIn many stories, man and woman are created at the same time, with equal standing. One example is the creation story in [[Genesis creation myth|Genesis 1]]: \"And God created the man in his image. In the image of God he created him.  Male and female he created them.\"<ref name=\"Genesis 1\">{{bibleref|Genesis|1:27}}</ref> Some commentators interpret the parallelism to be deliberately stressing that mankind is, in some sense, a \"unity in diversity\" from a divine perspective (compare ''[[e pluribus unum]]''),<ref>See Geneva College discussion of a biblical foundation for a broader concept of multiculturalism based on this verse\"\n\n\"Rather, human diversification receives its first mention in Genesis 1:27, where the text announces the creation of the one human race:  'So God created the human race in his own image ... male and female he made them.'  The text's singular term, 'human race' (`Adam in Hebrew), is specified as diverse in gender, male and female.  Diversification immediately receives further stimulus in the Cultural Mandate of Genesis 1:28:  \"Be fruitful, increase in number, fill the earth and subdue it.\"  This divine command calls explicitly for the scattering of the race\u2014a theme that shall recur in the Genesis narratives\u2014and thus calls implicitly for cultural diversification.\"\nByron Curtis, \"[http://www.geneva.edu/page/diversity A Blueprint for Excellence Through Diversity at Geneva College]\", ([[Geneva College]], 1999).</ref>\nand that [[woman|women]] as well as [[man|men]] are included in [[Image of God|God's image]].

The Qu'ran instructs women to wait at least three menstrual periods, called Iddah, before committing to a second marriage. The purpose of the Iddah is to ensure that a woman's pregnancy will be linked to the correct biological father. In the case of a Tal\u0101q, which is a divorce initiated by the man, the man is supposed to announce the words \"I divorce you\" aloud three times, each separated by a three-month waiting period. Certain practices of the Tal\u0101q divorce allows the \"I divorce you\" utterance to be completed in one sitting; however, the concept of \"Triple Divorce\" in one sitting is considered wrong in some branches of Islam such as with the Shia Muslims. During the three-month waiting period, only the man has the right to initiate a marital reunion if both sides desire to reconcile. This yields a gender equality perspective in the sense that women have power over men in regards to finance parallel to how men have power over women in regards to obedience, both of which are only valid to a reasonable extent. While a \u1e6cal\u0101q can be completed easily, a divorce that is initiated by the woman, called a Khula, is harder to obtain due to a woman's requirement to repay her dowry and give up child custody. More specifically, a woman is to give up custody of her child if the child is over the age of seven. If a woman gains custody of her child who is under the age of seven, she must still forfeit custody upon the child's seventh birthday. Although the Islamic religion requires the woman to repay her dowry, she is also entitled to receive financial support from her former husband if needed. This cycle of financial matters protects the woman's property from being taken advantage of during or after marriage.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://wmlawandpractice.com/2011/04/11/women%e2%80%99s-rights-in-islam-regarding-marriage-and-divorce/ | title=Women's Rights In Islam Regarding Marriage And Divorce | date=April 11, 2011 | accessdate=August 23, 2016 | author=Imani Jaafar-Mohammad, Esq.|author2=Charlie Lehmann|work=William Mitchell Journal of Law and Practice}}</ref>\n\n== Cultural effects on religious practice ==\nReligious worship may vary by individual due to differing cultural experiences of gender.\n\n=== Greco-Roman Paganism ===\nBoth men and women who practiced paganism in ancient civilizations such as Rome and Greece worshiped male and female deities, but goddesses played a much larger role in women's lives. Roman and Greek goddesses' domains often aligned with culturally specific gender expectations at the time which served to perpetrate them in many cases. One such expectation of women was to marry at a relatively young age. The quadrennial Bear Festival, known as Arkteia, was held on the outskirts of Athens in honor of Artemis and involved girls ages seven to fourteen. The girls would compete in public athletic events as Greek men sat as onlookers, observing potential wives.<ref name=\":0\">Kraemer, Ross Shepard.

As such, the rationale for such proscriptions is not clearly evident, though avoidance of procreation and contribution to society via establishing families are sometimes offered as pragmatic considerations. \n\nIn general, homosexuality is perceived as sinful in conservative movements and fully accepted in liberal movements.

He points out, for example, in his book ''Foi et histoire'' (Faith and History, 1980), that it is only in those cultures where the biblical text and Christianity have had some long term influence, that the status of women has gradually improved from that of property and progenitor to that of a full human being, equal to man. In cultures where the biblical text has not had any significant impact, women are regarded as property whose main purpose is to produce children. In such cultures, women are married as soon as they are able to procreate, they have little or no access to formal education, and they are allowed little self-determination. The main reason behind this social transformation is fundamentally linked to a statement found in Genesis 1:27: 'God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.' This text affirms the intrinsic dignity of both men and women regardless of their gender or social status. This is in stark contrast to ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia where the value of human beings was primarily determined on the basis of their social standing.\" Pierre Gilbert, ''How the Bible Shapes Our World''</ref>\n\n[[Priyamvada Gopal]], of [[Churchill College, Cambridge]], argues that increased gender equality is indeed a product of Judeo-Christian doctrine, but not ''exclusive'' to it. She expresses concern that gender equality is used by western countries as a rationale for \"[[neocolonialism]]\".<ref>\"The insistence that equality is a western concept to be defended against the incursions of others relies on a continued deafness to resistant voices from outside Judaeo-Christian contexts. This, ironically, makes the self-proclaimed liberals who insist on this useful collaborators for authoritarian chauvinists from outside the west. For they are all in curious agreement that women's equality is a western concept and call for it, accordingly, to be either enforced (that's why we sent in the troops) or rejected (by keeping women secluded).\" Priyamvada Gopal, \"[http://www.kuwaittimes.net/read_news.php?newsid=ODYyODgyODA= West has no monopoly on battle for gender equality] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612155056/http://www.kuwaittimes.net/read_news.php?newsid=ODYyODgyODA= |date=June 12, 2010 }}\", ''[[Kuwait Times]]'' September 30, 2007.</ref> Jamaine Abidogun argues that Judeo-Christian influence has indeed shaped gender roles in Nigeria (a strongly Christianised country); however, she doesn't consider feminism to be a product of Judeo-Christian doctrine, but rather a preferable form of \"neocolonialism\".<ref>\"These perceptions demonstrate a pattern of gender roles shaped by Western Judeo-Christian doctrine within the formal education curriculum, minimal inclusion of local history or cultural content, and loss of indigenous knowledge and practices. Gender-role change is one aspect of a general Westernizing effect of formal models of Western education on indigenous cultures.\" Jamaine Abidogun, \"Western education's impact on Northern Igbo gender roles in Nsukka, Nigeria\", ''[[Africa Today]]'' (2007).</ref>{{clarify|date=October 2019}}\n\n== Gender patterns in religious observance ==\nIn studies pertaining to gender patterns in religions, it has been widely accepted that females are more likely to be religious than males. In 1997, statistics gathered by Beit-Hallahmi and Argyle theorized this phenomenon into three primary causes. The first explanation is that women feel emotions at greater heights than men do, thus women tend to turn to religion more in times of high emotions such as gratitude or guilt. The second explanation is that female socialization is more likely to align with values that are commonly found in religion such as conflict mediation, tenderness, and humility. In contrast, male socialization is more likely to emphasize rebellion, thus making the guideline aspects of religion less appealing. The third explanation, which is also the most recent theory, is that females are more likely to be able to identify with religion as a natural consequence of societal structures. For example, since a majority of religions emphasize women as caretakers of the home, the societal expectation of women to take greater responsibility than men for the upbringing of a child makes religion an appealing commitment. Another example is that traditionally, men tend to work outside the home whereas women tend to work inside the home, which corresponds to studies that have shown that people are more likely to be religious when working inside of their homes.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=2095292|title=Gender Differences in Religion: A Test of the Structural Location Theory|first1=David|last1=de Vaus|first2=Ian|last2=McAllister|date=1 January 1987|publisher=|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=52|issue=4|pages=472\u2013481|doi=10.2307/2095292}}</ref>\n\n== Specific religions ==\nMore information on the role of gender in specific religions can be found on the following pages:\n\n* [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith]] \u2013 [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith and gender equality]]\n* [[Buddhism]] \u2013 [[Women in Buddhism]]\n* [[Christianity]] \u2013 [[Women in Christianity]]\n** [[Mormonism]] \u2013 [[Women and Mormonism]]\n* [[Hinduism]] \u2013 [[Women in Hinduism]]\n* [[Islam]] \u2013 [[Women in Islam]]\n* [[Judaism]] \u2013 [[Gender and Judaism]], [[Women in Judaism]]\n* [[Sikhism]] \u2013 [[Women in Sikhism]]\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Religion and sexuality]]\n*[[Sex segregation]]\n*[[Transgender people and religion]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commonscat}}\n*[http://www.artofmanliness.com/2016/08/08/is-christianity-an-inherently-feminine-religion/ Is Christianity an Inherently Feminine Religion?] Brett and Kate McKay\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070202085205/http://www.atheistfoundation.org.au/womenbible.htm Women in the Bible] by the Atheist Foundation of Australia Inc.\n\n{{Human group differences}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gender And Religion}}\n[[Category:Gender and religion| ]]\n[[Category:Feminism and spirituality]]\n", "name_user": "139.218.162.1", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eCreation myths about human gender)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_and_religion"}

Before he did so, postal maps were made with the temporary designation \"Mann's Choice\" written on it.

Buffalo Mountain and [[Wills Mountain]] rise to the east. The borough is mostly surrounded by [[Harrison Township, Bedford County, Pennsylvania|Harrison Township]], but it is bordered by [[Napier Township, Bedford County, Pennsylvania|Napier Township]] to the northwest.\n\nPennsylvania Routes [[Pennsylvania Route 31|31]] and [[Pennsylvania Route 96|96]] pass through the borough. Route 31 leads northeast {{convert|3.4|mi}} to [[U.S. Route 30]] west of [[Bedford, Pennsylvania|Bedford]], while Route 96 heads south {{convert|15|mi}} to [[Hyndman, Pennsylvania|Hyndman]] and {{convert|29|mi}} to [[Cumberland, Maryland]]. Route 31 and 96 together head northwest out of town, Route 96 leading to [[Shawnee State Park (Pennsylvania)|Shawnee State Park]] and [[Schellsburg, Pennsylvania|Schellsburg]], and Route 31 leading eventually to [[Somerset, Pennsylvania|Somerset]]. [[Interstate 76 (Ohio\u2013New Jersey)|Interstate 76]], the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]], passes just north of the borough limits but does not provide access; the nearest exit is in Bedford.\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the borough has a total area of {{convert|1.31|km2|disp=flip}}, of which {{convert|0.01|sqkm|disp=flip|3}}, or 1.02%, is water.<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/>\n\nManns Choice town center still preserves its historical watering trough once used to water the horses pulling traveling stages on their way across \"the glades\", now Glades Pike, to Fort Pitt, now Pittsburgh.  It has chiefly been an agricultural community since its settlement following the Revolutionary War.  The town's farms and forest were once a land grant offered to German mercenary Hessian J\u00e4gers paying loyalty to General George Washington's infantry.\n\nPrior to its settlement the area was home to the Shawnee and Monongahela native tribes.  The tribes inhabited the area's many small creeks, river banks and meadowlands.  They groomed a well balanced permacultural environment which still exists on thousands of surrounding acres of state forests, parks and farmlands today.\n\nToday the primary industry is still agriculture.  Of its many farms, Horn O' Plenty Farm and Freshtaurant is noted for pioneering innovative agricultural practices and markets that have influenced the region, reassuring confidence for the future of farmers.\n\nThe historic White Sulphur Springs Hotel is located {{convert|4|mi|0}} south of the borough in Harrison Township. Built in 1884, the building originated as a hotel and restaurant, and is now home to the non-profit ministry of Officers Christian Fellowship, which serves military servicepeople and their families as a retreat center. In the fall, winter and spring off-season, the facility operates as a conference center for churches, business meetings, banquets and day gatherings.\n\nIt is home to the Coral Caverns, which house the world's only fossilized coral reef open to the public since 1932.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|align=left\n|1890= 363\n|1900= 312\n|1910= 341\n|1920= 274\n|1930= 271\n|1940= 306\n|1950= 313\n|1960= 351\n|1970= 334\n|1980= 286\n|1990= 249\n|2000= 291\n|2010= 300\n|estyear=2017\n|estimate=289\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2017\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2017.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=March 24, 2018}}</ref>\n|footnote=Sources:<ref name=\"USDecennialCensus\">{{cite web|title=Census of Population and Housing|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=11 December 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref><ref name=CensusPopEst>{{cite web|title=Incorporated Places and Minor Civil Divisions Datasets: Subcounty Resident Population Estimates: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|work=Population Estimates|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=11 December 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HQu4Spqa?url=http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|archivedate=17 June 2013}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2000, there were 291 people, 116 households, and 75 families residing in the borough.
