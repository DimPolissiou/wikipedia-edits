Voters chose six representatives, or electors to the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]], who voted for [[President of the United States|president]] and [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]].\n\n[[United States presidential elections in Arkansas|Arkansas]] was won by the state's governor [[Bill Clinton]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]) with 53.21% of the popular vote over incumbent President [[George H. W. Bush|George H.W. Bush]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[Texas]]) with 35.48%. Businessman [[Ross Perot]] ([[Independent politician|I]]-Texas) finished in third, with 10.43% of the popular vote.<ref name=results/> Clinton ultimately won the national vote, defeating incumbent President Bush. Clinton was [[List of governors of Arkansas|Governor of Arkansas]] at the time, and as he was popular within the state, he easily won by a margin of 17.73%, making it the first time that Arkansas had voted Democratic since 1976 when it voted for [[Jimmy Carter]]. Arkansas and [[Washington, D.C.]] were the only contests in which Clinton, or any candidate, received over fifty percent of the popular vote.\n\nAfter the 1996 election, Arkansas would return to being solidly Republican.<ref>{{cite web|title=1992 Presidential General Election Results|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=1992|publisher=U.S. Election Atlas|accessdate=8 June 2012}}</ref> {{As of|2016|11|alt=As of the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]]}}, this is the last election in which [[Baxter County, Arkansas|Baxter County]], [[Carroll County, Arkansas|Carroll County]], [[Newton County, Arkansas|Newton County]], [[Boone County, Arkansas|Boone County]], and [[Polk County, Arkansas|Polk County]] voted for a Democratic presidential candidate.<ref name=\"How\">Sullivan, Robert David; [http://www.americamagazine.org/content/unconventional-wisdom/how-red-and-blue-map-evolved-over-past-century \u2018How the Red and Blue Map Evolved Over the Past Century\u2019]; ''America Magazine'' in ''The National Catholic Review''; June 29, 2016</ref>\n\n==Results==\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|- style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9\"\n! colspan=\"6\" | United States presidential election in Arkansas, 1992<ref name=results>{{cite web|title=State of Arkansas Historical Election Results|url=http://www.sos.arkansas.gov/elections/historicalElectionResults/Pages/default.aspx|publisher=Arkansas Office of the Secretary of State|accessdate=8 June 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902151834/http://www.sos.arkansas.gov/elections/historicalElectionResults/Pages/default.aspx|archive-date=2012-09-02|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n|-bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\" align=\"center\"\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party\n! style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes\n! style=\"width: 7em\" |Percentage\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Electoral votes\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#3333FF; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | '''[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]'''\n| '''[[Bill Clinton]]'''\n| align=\"right\" | '''505,823'''\n| align=\"right\" | '''53.21%'''\n| align=\"right\" | '''6'''\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#FF3333; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]\n| [[George H.W.

Businessman [[Ross Perot]] ([[Independent politician|I]]-Texas) finished in third, with 10.43% of the popular vote.<ref name=results/> Clinton ultimately won the national vote, defeating incumbent President Bush. Clinton was [[List of governors of Arkansas|Governor of Arkansas]] at the time, and as he was popular within the state, he easily won by a margin of 17.73%, making it the first time that Arkansas had voted Democratic since 1976 when it voted for [[Jimmy Carter]]. Arkansas and [[Washington, D.C.]] were the only contests in which Clinton, or any candidate, received over fifty percent of the popular vote.\n\nAfter the 1996 election, Arkansas would return to being solidly Republican.<ref>{{cite web|title=1992 Presidential General Election Results|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=1992|publisher=U.S. Election Atlas|accessdate=8 June 2012}}</ref> {{As of|2016|11|alt=As of the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]]}}, this is the last election in which [[Baxter County, Arkansas|Baxter County]], [[Carroll County, Arkansas|Carroll County]], [[Newton County, Arkansas|Newton County]], [[Boone County, Arkansas|Boone County]], and [[Polk County, Arkansas|Polk County]] voted for a Democratic presidential candidate.<ref name=\"How\">Sullivan, Robert David; [http://www.americamagazine.org/content/unconventional-wisdom/how-red-and-blue-map-evolved-over-past-century \u2018How the Red and Blue Map Evolved Over the Past Century\u2019]; ''America Magazine'' in ''The National Catholic Review''; June 29, 2016</ref>\n\n==Results==\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|- style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9\"\n! colspan=\"6\" | United States presidential election in Arkansas, 1992<ref name=results>{{cite web|title=State of Arkansas Historical Election Results|url=http://www.sos.arkansas.gov/elections/historicalElectionResults/Pages/default.aspx|publisher=Arkansas Office of the Secretary of State|accessdate=8 June 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902151834/http://www.sos.arkansas.gov/elections/historicalElectionResults/Pages/default.aspx|archive-date=2012-09-02|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n|-bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\" align=\"center\"\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party\n! style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes\n! style=\"width: 7em\" |Percentage\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Electoral votes\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#3333FF; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | '''[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]'''\n| '''[[Bill Clinton]]'''\n| align=\"right\" | '''505,823'''\n| align=\"right\" | '''53.21%'''\n| align=\"right\" | '''6'''\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#FF3333; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]\n| [[George H.W.

The distillation process purifies the liquid and removes diluting components like water, for the purpose of increasing its [[concentration|proportion]] of alcohol content (commonly expressed as alcohol by volume, [[Alcohol by volume|ABV]]).<ref name=Britannica>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9106006/distilled-spirit|title=distilled spirit - alcoholic beverage|work=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica}}</ref> As liquors contain significantly more [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], they are considered \"harder\" \u2013 in North America, the term ''hard liquor'' is used to distinguish distilled alcoholic drinks from non-distilled ones.\n\nAs examples, this term does not include beverages such as [[beer]], [[wine]], [[mead]], [[sake]], [[huangjiu]] or [[cider]], as they are fermented but not distilled. These all have a relatively low alcohol content, typically less than 15%. [[Brandy]] is a liquor produced by the distillation of wine, and has an ABV of over 35%. Other examples of liquors include [[vodka]], [[baijiu]], [[sh\u014dch\u016b]], [[soju]], [[gin]], [[rum]], [[tequila]], [[mezcal]], and [[whisky]].  (Also see [[list of alcoholic drinks]], and [[List of national liquors|liquors by national origin]].)\n\n==Nomenclature==\nThe term \"spirit\" refers to liquor that contains no added sugar and has at least 20% [[alcohol by volume]] (ABV).{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nLiquor bottled with added sugar and added flavorings, such as [[Grand Marnier]], [[Frangelico]], and [[United States|American]] [[schnapps]], are known instead as [[liqueur]]s.\n\nLiquor generally has an alcohol concentration higher than 30%. [[Beer]] and [[wine]], which are not distilled, are limited to a maximum alcohol content of about 20% ABV, as most [[yeast]]s cannot metabolise when the concentration of alcohol is above this level; as a consequence, [[fermentation]] ceases at that point.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe origin of \"liquor\" and its close relative \"liquid\" was the Latin verb ''liquere'', meaning \"to be fluid\". According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', an early use of the word in the English language, meaning simply \"a liquid\", can be dated to 1225. The first use the ''OED'' mentions of its meaning \"a liquid for drinking\" occurred in the 14th century. Its use as a term for \"an intoxicating alcoholic drink\" appeared in the 16th century.\n\n==History of distillation==\n{{Main|Distillation}}\n\n===Precursors===\n[[File:Zosimos distillation equipment.jpg|thumb|Distillation equipment used by the 3rd century alchemist [[Zosimos of Panopolis]],<ref>{{cite book|page=203|url=https://books.google.com/?id=earQAAAAMAAJ|title=The Volatile Oils|author=E.

These spirits would have had a much lower [[Alcohol by volume|alcohol content]] (about 40% ABV) than the alchemists' pure distillations, and they were likely first thought of as medicinal [[elixir]]s. Liquor consumption rose dramatically in Europe in and after the mid-14th century, when distilled liquors were commonly used as remedies for the [[Black Death]]. Around 1400, methods to distill spirits from wheat, barley, and rye beers, a cheaper option than grapes, were discovered. Thus began the [[List of national liquors|\"national\" drinks]] of Europe: ''[[jenever]]'' (Belgium and the Netherlands), [[gin]] (England), ''[[Schnapps|Schnaps]]'' (Germany), ''[[grappa]]'' (Italy), ''[[borovi\u010dka]]'' (Slovakia), ''[[horilka]]'' (Ukraine), ''[[akvavit]]''/''[[snaps]]'' (Scandinavia), ''[[vodka]]'' (Poland and Russia), ''[[ouzo]]'' (Greece), ''[[rakia]]'' (the Balkans), and ''[[poit\u00edn]]'' (Ireland). The actual names emerged only in the 16th century, but the drinks were well known prior to then.\n\n===Government regulation===\n====Production====\nIt is legal to distill beverage alcohol as a hobby for personal use in some countries, including New Zealand and the Netherlands.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nIn the [[United States]], it is illegal to distill beverage alcohol without a license. In some parts of the U.S., it is also illegal to sell a still without a license. However, all states allow unlicensed individuals to [[Homebrewing|make their own beer]], and some also allow unlicensed individuals to make their own wine (although  making beer and wine is also prohibited in some local jurisdictions).\n\n====Sale====\nSome countries and sub-national jurisdictions limit or prohibit the sale of certain very high-percentage alcohol, commonly known as [[Rectified spirit#Regulation|neutral spirit]].\n\n===Microdistilling===\n[[Microdistillery|Microdistilling]] (also known as craft distilling) began to re-emerge as a trend in the United States following the [[microbrewing]] and [[craft beer]] movement in the last decades of the 20th century.

The effects of alcohol depend on the amount an individual has drunk, the percentage of alcohol in the spirits and the timespan that the consumption took place, the amount of food eaten and whether an individual has taken other prescription, over-the-counter or [[street drugs]], among other factors. \n\nDrinking enough to cause a [[blood alcohol concentration]] (BAC) of 0.03%-0.12% typically causes an overall improvement in mood and possible [[euphoria]], increased self-confidence, and sociability, decreased anxiety, a [[Alcohol flush reaction|flushed, red appearance in the face]] and impaired judgment and fine muscle coordination. A BAC of 0.09% to 0.25% causes [[lethargy]], [[sedation]], balance problems and blurred vision. A BAC from 0.18% to 0.30% causes profound confusion, impaired speech (e.g., slurred speech), staggering, dizziness and vomiting. A BAC from 0.25% to 0.40% causes [[stupor]], unconsciousness, [[anterograde amnesia]], vomiting, and [[respiratory depression]] (potentially life-threatening). Death may occur due to inhalation of vomit ([[pulmonary aspiration]]) while unconscious. A BAC from 0.35% to 0.80% causes a [[coma]] (unconsciousness), life-threatening respiratory depression and possibly fatal [[alcohol poisoning]]. \n\nAs with all alcoholic beverages, [[driving under the influence]], operating an aircraft or heavy machinery increases the risk of an accident; as such many countries have penalties for drunk driving.\n\n===Long-term effects===\n{{See also|Long-term effects of alcohol consumption }}\n\nThe main active ingredient of distilled spirits is alcohol, and therefore, the health effects of alcohol apply to spirits. Drinking small quantities of alcohol (less than one drink per day for women and 2 drinks per day for men) is associated with a ''decreased'' risk of [[heart disease]], [[stroke]], [[diabetes mellitus]], and early death.<ref name=Kee2014>{{cite journal|last1=O'Keefe|first1=JH|last2=Bhatti|first2=SK|last3=Bajwa|first3=A|last4=DiNicolantonio|first4=JJ|last5=Lavie|first5=CJ|title=Alcohol and cardiovascular health: the dose makes the poison...or the remedy.|journal=Mayo Clinic Proceedings|date=March 2014|volume=89|issue=3|pages=382\u201393|pmid=24582196|doi=10.1016/j.mayocp.2013.11.005}}</ref> Drinking more than this amount; however, increases the risk of heart disease, [[high blood pressure]], [[atrial fibrillation]], and [[stroke]].<ref name=Kee2014 /> The risk is greater in younger people due to [[binge drinking]] which may result in violence or accidents.<ref name=Kee2014 /> About 3.3 million deaths (5.9% of all deaths) are believed to be due to alcohol each year.<ref name=NIH2015Stats>{{cite web|title=Alcohol Facts and Statistics|url=http://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohol-health/overview-alcohol-consumption/alcohol-facts-and-statistics|accessdate=9 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[Alcoholism]], also known as \"alcohol use disorder\",  is a broad term for any drinking of [[ethanol|alcohol]] that results in problems.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Jill Littrell|title=Understanding and Treating Alcoholism Volume I: An Empirically Based Clinician's Handbook for the Treatment of Alcoholism:volume Ii: Biological, Psychological, and Social Aspects of Alcohol Consumption and Abuse.|date=2014|publisher=Taylor and Francis|location=Hoboken|isbn=9781317783145|page=55|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2k57AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA55|quote=The World Health Organization defines alcoholism as any drinking which results in problems}}</ref> It was previously divided into two types: [[alcohol abuse]] and [[alcohol dependence]].<ref name=NIH2003>{{cite web|last1=Hasin|first1=Deborah|title=Classification of Alcohol Use Disorders|url=http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arh27-1/5-17.htm|website=pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/|accessdate=28 February 2015|date=December 2003}}</ref><ref name=NIH2013>{{cite web|title=Alcohol Use Disorder: A Comparison Between DSM\u2013IV and DSM\u20135|url=http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/dsmfactsheet/dsmfact.htm|accessdate=9 May 2015|date=November 2013}}</ref> In a medical{{clarify|reason=over what period of time?|date=January 2016}} context, alcoholism is said to exist when two or more of the following conditions is present: a person drinks large amounts over a long time period, has difficulty cutting down, acquiring and drinking alcohol takes up a great deal of time, alcohol is strongly desired, usage results in not fulfilling responsibilities, usage results in social problems, usage results in health problems, usage results in risky situations, [[Alcohol withdrawal syndrome|withdrawal]] occurs when stopping, and [[alcohol tolerance]] has occurred with use.<ref name=NIH2013/> Alcoholism reduces a person's life expectancy by around ten years<ref name=Schu2014>{{cite journal|last1=Schuckit|first1=MA|title=Recognition and management of withdrawal delirium (delirium tremens).|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|date=27 November 2014|volume=371|issue=22|pages=2109\u201313|pmid=25427113|doi=10.1056/NEJMra1407298|url=http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/08b9z9th}}</ref> and alcohol use is the third-leading cause of early death in the United States.<ref name=Kee2014 /> No professional medical association recommends that people who are nondrinkers should start drinking wine.<ref name=Kee2014 /><ref>[http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/GettingHealthy/NutritionCenter/HealthyEating/Alcohol-and-Heart-Health_UCM_305173_Article.jsp ''Alcohol and Heart Health''] American Heart Association</ref>\n\nWhile lower quality evidence suggests a cardioprotective effect, no controlled studies have been completed on the effect of alcohol on the risk of developing heart disease or stroke.

The distillation process purifies the liquid and removes diluting components like water, for the purpose of increasing its [[concentration|proportion]] of alcohol content (commonly expressed as alcohol by volume, [[Alcohol by volume|ABV]]).<ref name=Britannica>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9106006/distilled-spirit|title=distilled spirit - alcoholic beverage|work=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica}}</ref> As liquors contain significantly more [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], they are considered \"harder\" \u2013 in North America, the term ''hard liquor'' is used to distinguish distilled alcoholic drinks from non-distilled ones.\n\nAs examples, this term does not include beverages such as [[beer]], [[wine]], [[mead]], [[sake]], [[huangjiu]] or [[cider]], as they are fermented but not distilled. These all have a relatively low alcohol content, typically less than 15%. [[Brandy]] is a liquor produced by the distillation of wine, and has an ABV of over 35%. Other examples of liquors include [[vodka]], [[baijiu]], [[sh\u014dch\u016b]], [[soju]], [[gin]], [[rum]], [[tequila]], [[mezcal]], and [[whisky]].  (Also see [[list of alcoholic drinks]], and [[List of national liquors|liquors by national origin]].)\n\n==Nomenclature==\nThe term \"spirit\" refers to liquor that contains no added sugar and has at least 20% [[alcohol by volume]] (ABV).{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nLiquor bottled with added sugar and added flavorings, such as [[Grand Marnier]], [[Frangelico]], and [[United States|American]] [[schnapps]], are known instead as [[liqueur]]s.\n\nLiquor generally has an alcohol concentration higher than 30%. [[Beer]] and [[wine]], which are not distilled, are limited to a maximum alcohol content of about 20% ABV, as most [[yeast]]s cannot metabolise when the concentration of alcohol is above this level; as a consequence, [[fermentation]] ceases at that point.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe origin of \"liquor\" and its close relative \"liquid\" was the Latin verb ''liquere'', meaning \"to be fluid\". According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', an early use of the word in the English language, meaning simply \"a liquid\", can be dated to 1225. The first use the ''OED'' mentions of its meaning \"a liquid for drinking\" occurred in the 14th century. Its use as a term for \"an intoxicating alcoholic drink\" appeared in the 16th century.\n\n==History of distillation==\n{{Main|Distillation}}\n\n===Precursors===\n[[File:Zosimos distillation equipment.jpg|thumb|Distillation equipment used by the 3rd century alchemist [[Zosimos of Panopolis]],<ref>{{cite book|page=203|url=https://books.google.com/?id=earQAAAAMAAJ|title=The Volatile Oils|author=E.

These spirits would have had a much lower [[Alcohol by volume|alcohol content]] (about 40% ABV) than the alchemists' pure distillations, and they were likely first thought of as medicinal [[elixir]]s. Liquor consumption rose dramatically in Europe in and after the mid-14th century, when distilled liquors were commonly used as remedies for the [[Black Death]]. Around 1400, methods to distill spirits from wheat, barley, and rye beers, a cheaper option than grapes, were discovered. Thus began the [[List of national liquors|\"national\" drinks]] of Europe: ''[[jenever]]'' (Belgium and the Netherlands), [[gin]] (England), ''[[Schnapps|Schnaps]]'' (Germany), ''[[grappa]]'' (Italy), ''[[borovi\u010dka]]'' (Slovakia), ''[[horilka]]'' (Ukraine), ''[[akvavit]]''/''[[snaps]]'' (Scandinavia), ''[[vodka]]'' (Poland and Russia), ''[[ouzo]]'' (Greece), ''[[rakia]]'' (the Balkans), and ''[[poit\u00edn]]'' (Ireland). The actual names emerged only in the 16th century, but the drinks were well known prior to then.\n\n===Government regulation===\n====Production====\nIt is legal to distill beverage alcohol as a hobby for personal use in some countries, including New Zealand and the Netherlands.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nIn the [[United States]], it is illegal to distill beverage alcohol without a license.

Different concentrations of alcohol in the human body have different effects on a person. The effects of alcohol depend on the amount an individual has drunk, the percentage of alcohol in the spirits and the timespan that the consumption took place, the amount of food eaten and whether an individual has taken other prescription, over-the-counter or [[street drugs]], among other factors. \n\nDrinking enough to cause a [[blood alcohol concentration]] (BAC) of 0.03%-0.12% typically causes an overall improvement in mood and possible [[euphoria]], increased self-confidence, and sociability, decreased anxiety, a [[Alcohol flush reaction|flushed, red appearance in the face]] and impaired judgment and fine muscle coordination. A BAC of 0.09% to 0.25% causes [[lethargy]], [[sedation]], balance problems and blurred vision. A BAC from 0.18% to 0.30% causes profound confusion, impaired speech (e.g., slurred speech), staggering, dizziness and vomiting. A BAC from 0.25% to 0.40% causes [[stupor]], unconsciousness, [[anterograde amnesia]], vomiting, and [[respiratory depression]] (potentially life-threatening). Death may occur due to inhalation of vomit ([[pulmonary aspiration]]) while unconscious. A BAC from 0.35% to 0.80% causes a [[coma]] (unconsciousness), life-threatening respiratory depression and possibly fatal [[alcohol poisoning]]. \n\nAs with all alcoholic beverages, [[driving under the influence]], operating an aircraft or heavy machinery increases the risk of an accident; as such many countries have penalties for drunk driving.\n\n===Long-term effects===\n{{See also|Long-term effects of alcohol consumption }}\n\nThe main active ingredient of distilled spirits is alcohol, and therefore, the health effects of alcohol apply to spirits. Drinking small quantities of alcohol (less than one drink per day for women and 2 drinks per day for men) is associated with a ''decreased'' risk of [[heart disease]], [[stroke]], [[diabetes mellitus]], and early death.<ref name=Kee2014>{{cite journal|last1=O'Keefe|first1=JH|last2=Bhatti|first2=SK|last3=Bajwa|first3=A|last4=DiNicolantonio|first4=JJ|last5=Lavie|first5=CJ|title=Alcohol and cardiovascular health: the dose makes the poison...or the remedy.|journal=Mayo Clinic Proceedings|date=March 2014|volume=89|issue=3|pages=382\u201393|pmid=24582196|doi=10.1016/j.mayocp.2013.11.005}}</ref> Drinking more than this amount; however, increases the risk of heart disease, [[high blood pressure]], [[atrial fibrillation]], and [[stroke]].<ref name=Kee2014 /> The risk is greater in younger people due to [[binge drinking]] which may result in violence or accidents.<ref name=Kee2014 /> About 3.3 million deaths (5.9% of all deaths) are believed to be due to alcohol each year.<ref name=NIH2015Stats>{{cite web|title=Alcohol Facts and Statistics|url=http://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohol-health/overview-alcohol-consumption/alcohol-facts-and-statistics|accessdate=9 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[Alcoholism]], also known as \"alcohol use disorder\",  is a broad term for any drinking of [[ethanol|alcohol]] that results in problems.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Jill Littrell|title=Understanding and Treating Alcoholism Volume I: An Empirically Based Clinician's Handbook for the Treatment of Alcoholism:volume Ii: Biological, Psychological, and Social Aspects of Alcohol Consumption and Abuse.|date=2014|publisher=Taylor and Francis|location=Hoboken|isbn=9781317783145|page=55|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2k57AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA55|quote=The World Health Organization defines alcoholism as any drinking which results in problems}}</ref> It was previously divided into two types: [[alcohol abuse]] and [[alcohol dependence]].<ref name=NIH2003>{{cite web|last1=Hasin|first1=Deborah|title=Classification of Alcohol Use Disorders|url=http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arh27-1/5-17.htm|website=pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/|accessdate=28 February 2015|date=December 2003}}</ref><ref name=NIH2013>{{cite web|title=Alcohol Use Disorder: A Comparison Between DSM\u2013IV and DSM\u20135|url=http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/dsmfactsheet/dsmfact.htm|accessdate=9 May 2015|date=November 2013}}</ref> In a medical{{clarify|reason=over what period of time?|date=January 2016}} context, alcoholism is said to exist when two or more of the following conditions is present: a person drinks large amounts over a long time period, has difficulty cutting down, acquiring and drinking alcohol takes up a great deal of time, alcohol is strongly desired, usage results in not fulfilling responsibilities, usage results in social problems, usage results in health problems, usage results in risky situations, [[Alcohol withdrawal syndrome|withdrawal]] occurs when stopping, and [[alcohol tolerance]] has occurred with use.<ref name=NIH2013/> Alcoholism reduces a person's life expectancy by around ten years<ref name=Schu2014>{{cite journal|last1=Schuckit|first1=MA|title=Recognition and management of withdrawal delirium (delirium tremens).|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|date=27 November 2014|volume=371|issue=22|pages=2109\u201313|pmid=25427113|doi=10.1056/NEJMra1407298|url=http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/08b9z9th}}</ref> and alcohol use is the third-leading cause of early death in the United States.<ref name=Kee2014 /> No professional medical association recommends that people who are nondrinkers should start drinking wine.<ref name=Kee2014 /><ref>[http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/GettingHealthy/NutritionCenter/HealthyEating/Alcohol-and-Heart-Health_UCM_305173_Article.jsp ''Alcohol and Heart Health''] American Heart Association</ref>\n\nWhile lower quality evidence suggests a cardioprotective effect, no controlled studies have been completed on the effect of alcohol on the risk of developing heart disease or stroke.

It was released on September 23, 2008 by [[Downtown Records]].\n\nFollowing the success of their debut album ''[[Robbers & Cowards]]'' and spending the rest of 2007 touring across North America and Europe, the band started recording new material for their next album over the course of four months. Taking its title from the paper of the same name by American philosopher [[Josiah Royce]], ''Loyalty to Loyalty'' carries a darker tone than its previous album by having a more experimental sound throughout and songs that deal with philosophies and politics, including [[suicide]], [[Faith|crisis of faith]], [[public security]] and [[job satisfaction]].\n\nThe album received a generally positive reception but critics said it was uneven in terms of songwriting and performance. ''Loyalty to Loyalty'' debuted at number 21 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and spawned two [[Single (music)|single]]s: \"[[Something Is Not Right with Me]]\" and \"I've Seen Enough\", the former was voted number 38 in the [[Triple J Hottest 100]] in 2008. To promote the album, the band toured across North America, Europe and Australia with appearances at music festivals and talk shows.\n\n==Background==\nCold War Kids released their debut album ''[[Robbers & Cowards]]'' on October 11, 2006. The album garnered a largely positive reception from critics, but Marc Hogan of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' criticized the band for its songwriting, melodies and [[Christianity|Christian]] symbolism, saying that \"''Robbers and Cowards'' insults our intelligence a few times too often.\"<ref name=\"Pitchfork\">{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9533-robbers-and-cowards/|title=Cold War Kids: Robbers and Cowards|last=Hogan|first=Marc|website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|date=October 19, 2006|accessdate=April 14, 2014}}</ref> Cat Dirt Sez of the ''[[San Diego CityBeat]]'' said that Hogan's review was an example of lazy journalism,<ref name=\"Stereogum\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.stereogum.com/4368/christianity_and_the_cold_war_kids_backlash/news/|title=Christianity And The Cold War Kids Backlash|author=Stereogum Staff|magazine=[[Stereogum]]|publisher=[[SpinMedia]]|date=January 18, 2007|accessdate=April 14, 2014}}</ref> with lead guitarist Jonnie Russell saying that the reviewer wanted a wittier approach to the album rather than a thoughtful assessment of it.<ref name=\"Stereogum\"/> To promote the album, the band spent most of 2007 touring across North America and Europe through appearances at music festivals and talk shows.

It was released on September 23, 2008 by [[Downtown Records]].\n\nFollowing the success of their debut album ''[[Robbers & Cowards]]'' and spending the rest of 2007 touring across North America and Europe, the band started recording new material for their next album over the course of four months. Taking its title from the paper of the same name by American philosopher [[Josiah Royce]], ''Loyalty to Loyalty'' carries a darker tone than its previous album by having a more experimental sound throughout and songs that deal with philosophies and politics, including [[suicide]], [[Faith|crisis of faith]], [[public security]] and [[job satisfaction]].\n\nThe album received a generally positive reception but critics said it was uneven in terms of songwriting and performance. ''Loyalty to Loyalty'' debuted at number 21 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and spawned two [[Single (music)|single]]s: \"[[Something Is Not Right with Me]]\" and \"I've Seen Enough\", the former was voted number 38 in the [[Triple J Hottest 100]] in 2008.

[[Bartholomew Fair]] and [[Southwark Fair]] in the 18th century were moments of great festivity and release. There was juggling, pickpocketing, whoring, drinking, masquerade \u2013 people dressed up as the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] and indulged in vulgar acts. It allowed people a space to free-up but it was banned for moral reasons and for the antiauthoritarian behaviour that went on like stoning of constables. Carnival allowed people to dramatise their grievances against the authorities on the street... Notting Hill Carnival single-handedly revived this tradition and is a great contribution to [[British culture|British cultural life]].\"<ref name=\"culture\">Professor David Dabydeen (August 2010), [http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/knowledge/arts/nottinghill \"Notting Hill Carnival\"], Yesu Persaud Centre for Caribbean Studies, University of Warwick. Retrieved 30 August 2015.</ref> \n</blockquote>\nBartholomew Fair was suppressed in 1883 by the City authorities for encouraging debauchery and public disorder.\n\nThis huge street festival attracts around one million people every year to Notting Hill and highlights Caribbean and black diasporic cultures. Carnival uses influences from many other festivals around the world. Authors Julian Henriques and Beatrice Ferrara claim the festival draws on other carnivals including Barbados [[Crop Over]], Grenada Carnival, Guyana \"Mash\", Canadian [[Caribana]] in Toronto, the US [[Labor Day]] Festival in Brooklyn, \"Vincy Mas\" in St. Vincent. They also explain that Notting Hill Carnival is dually influenced by its diasporic cultures and its own country's influences, with both the Jamaican dancehall scene and the British club scene providing inspirations. Henriques and Ferrara claim: \"Carnival also has an explosive auditory impact due to its cacophony of sounds, in which soca, steel bands, calypso floats and sound systems mix and mingle in a multi-media and multi-sensory event\" (Ferrara 132). This mixture of percussion, with emphasis on the beat and rhythm, leads to the extreme dancing in the streets for which Carnival is known, with citizens participating to the beat of the music, using mud and paint, dancing with the lower parts of the body. Henriques and Ferrara explain that people emphasize the \"baseness\" of the music, with everything being about the \"bottom\": the ground, the bottom of the body, and the bottom of the beat. The festival uses influences from the Jamaican dancehalls and British clubs, and the music is made loud enough for participants to feel the beat. The vibrations from the speakers allow people to better connect with the ground and bring their experience to another level.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Henriques |first1=Julian |last2=Ferrara |first2=Beatrice |title=Black Popular Music in Britain Since 1945}}</ref>\n\nNotting Hill Carnival is very reminiscent of [[Dance hall (Jamaican)|Jamaican dancehall sessions]] due to the sounding{{clarify|date=August 2018}} of the event creating a \"space\". According to one 2014 academic article, Notting Hill Carnival's use of [[Sound system (Jamaican)|sound systems]] invokes cultural and personal associations for listeners, bringing about another \"space\", or a home for populations of the [[Paul Gilroy|Black Atlantic Diaspora]]. Physically, the dominance of the sound envelops the crowd, creating a setting for the Carnival even though there are no physical boundaries. The presence of the sound systems in the streets precipitates an environment where participants hear the sounds before they can actually see the systems themselves. The experience that all of these factors brings about for participants of the Carnival is representative of the Carnival-goers becoming a part of the larger diaspora, and acquiring a feeling of a distant African homeland, without having seen or having first-hand knowledge of the African continent.<ref name=\"The Sounding\">Henriques, Julian, and Beatrice Ferrara, \"The Sounding of Notting Hill Carnival: Music as Space, Place and Territory.\"</ref>\n\nThe authors of the same article further explain how Notting Hill Carnival also creates \"territory\". The parade route portion of the Carnival is where carnival floats play both recorded and live music and circulate the street, visualizing the boundaries of Carnival and marking its territory. The circulating movement of the Carnival parade is also an extending of space through sound. Territorializing the space through sounds of African beats, such as the pan, fosters a sense of identity and unity for the overall Carnival.<ref name=\"The Sounding\" />\n\nThe Carnival further diversified in 1984 with the appearance of the London School of Samba. Formed in that year, they were the first samba school in the UK and have paraded every year since (with the exception of 1992). Other samba schools have also paraded in Carnival, notably Acad\u00eamicos de Madureira (1992\u201394), Quilombo do Samba (1993\u20132006) & the Paraiso School of Samba (since 2002). These groups are also notable as they sometimes parade with more than 200 performers, along with several decorated floats.\n\n== Public order ==\nSince the carnival did not have local authority permission, initial police involvement was aimed at preventing it taking place at all, which resulted in regular confrontation and riots. In 1976, the police had been expecting hostility due to what they deemed as trouble the year before. Consequently, after discovering pickpockets in the crowd, police took a heavy-handed approach against the large congregation of black people and it became \"no-man's land\". The 1600-strong police force violently broke up the carnival, with the arrest of 60 people. In the aftermath of the event, the carnival was portrayed in a very pointed way, with those aiding the riots lumped together as the \"trouble-makers\" responsible.<ref>Sarah Phillips, [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/mar/13/robert-golden-best-photograph \"Robert Golden's best photograph: the 1976 Notting Hill carnival riots\"], ''The Guardian'', 13 March 2013.</ref>\n\nAfter the 1976 Notting Hill Carnival the [[Police Federation of England and Wales|Police Federation]] pressed for the introduction of riot shields to protect police from objects thrown at them, although the shields also had the potential for aggressive use, as in 1977.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=rj7TrpWFVjQC&pg=PA739&lpg=PA739&dq=notting+hill+carnival&source=bl&ots=1yRRuZvOc7&sig=hvXQQRsa3O-zgjMWY66aA80cnzE&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjNoJqFu-_VAhWIF8AKHd7qAVIQ6AEIYzAN#v=onepage&q=notting%20hill%20carnival&f=false \"Riot shields \u2013 protective or aggressive?\"], ''[[New Scientist]]'' (Vol. 75, No. 1070), 22 September 1977, p. 739.</ref><ref>Roger Fowler,\n [https://books.google.com/books?id=bX5GAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA248&lpg=PA248&dq=notting+hill+carnival&source=bl&ots=HzDqP2U0_W&sig=khBvsA8qZAC32l3qq8192FDuMq8&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjHlai3v-_VAhXmK8AKHZNIAjAQ6AEIVjAK#v=snippet&q=notting%20hill%20carnival&f=false ''Language in the News: Discourse and Ideology in the Press''], p. 248.</ref><ref>Tony Moore, ''Policing Notting Hill: Fifty Years of Turbulence'', Waterside Press, 2013, p. 195.</ref>\nA change of policy came after a confrontation in 1987, when the Carnival was allowed to take place with police adopting a more conciliatory approach.

[[Bartholomew Fair]] and [[Southwark Fair]] in the 18th century were moments of great festivity and release. There was juggling, pickpocketing, whoring, drinking, masquerade \u2013 people dressed up as the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] and indulged in vulgar acts. It allowed people a space to free-up but it was banned for moral reasons and for the antiauthoritarian behaviour that went on like stoning of constables. Carnival allowed people to dramatise their grievances against the authorities on the street... Notting Hill Carnival single-handedly revived this tradition and is a great contribution to [[British culture|British cultural life]].\"<ref name=\"culture\">Professor David Dabydeen (August 2010), [http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/knowledge/arts/nottinghill \"Notting Hill Carnival\"], Yesu Persaud Centre for Caribbean Studies, University of Warwick. Retrieved 30 August 2015.</ref> \n</blockquote>\nBartholomew Fair was suppressed in 1883 by the City authorities for encouraging debauchery and public disorder.\n\nThis huge street festival attracts around one million people every year to Notting Hill and highlights Caribbean and black diasporic cultures. Carnival uses influences from many other festivals around the world. Authors Julian Henriques and Beatrice Ferrara claim the festival draws on other carnivals including Barbados [[Crop Over]], Grenada Carnival, Guyana \"Mash\", Canadian [[Caribana]] in Toronto, the US [[Labor Day]] Festival in Brooklyn, \"Vincy Mas\" in St. Vincent. They also explain that Notting Hill Carnival is dually influenced by its diasporic cultures and its own country\u2019s influences, with both the Jamaican dancehall scene and the British club scene providing inspirations. Henriques and Ferrara claim: \"Carnival also has an explosive auditory impact due to its cacophony of sounds, in which soca, steel bands, calypso floats and sound systems mix and mingle in a multi-media and multi-sensory event\" (Ferrara 132). This mixture of percussion, with emphasis on the beat and rhythm, leads to the extreme dancing in the streets for which Carnival is known, with citizens participating to the beat of the music, using mud and paint, dancing with the lower parts of the body. Henriques and Ferrara explain that people emphasize the \"baseness\" of the music, with everything being about the \"bottom\": the ground, the bottom of the body, and the bottom of the beat. The festival uses influences from the Jamaican dancehalls and British clubs, and the music is made loud enough for participants to feel the beat. The vibrations from the speakers allow people to better connect with the ground and bring their experience to another level.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Henriques |first1=Julian |last2=Ferrara |first2=Beatrice |title=Black Popular Music in Britain Since 1945}}</ref>\n\nNotting Hill Carnival is very reminiscent of [[Dance hall (Jamaican)|Jamaican dancehall sessions]] due to the sounding{{clarify|date=August 2018}} of the event creating a \"space\". According to one 2014 academic article, Notting Hill Carnival's use of [[Sound system (Jamaican)|sound systems]] invokes cultural and personal associations for listeners, bringing about another \"space\", or a home for populations of the [[Paul Gilroy|Black Atlantic Diaspora]]. Physically, the dominance of the sound envelops the crowd, creating a setting for the Carnival even though there are no physical boundaries. The presence of the sound systems in the streets precipitates an environment where participants hear the sounds before they can actually see the systems themselves. The experience that all of these factors brings about for participants of the Carnival is representative of the Carnival-goers becoming a part of the larger diaspora, and acquiring a feeling of a distant African homeland, without having seen or having first-hand knowledge of the African continent.<ref name=\"The Sounding\">Henriques, Julian, and Beatrice Ferrara, \"The Sounding of Notting Hill Carnival: Music as Space, Place and Territory.\"</ref>\n\nThe authors of the same article further explain how Notting Hill Carnival also creates \"territory\". The parade route portion of the Carnival is where carnival floats play both recorded and live music and circulate the street, visualizing the boundaries of Carnival and marking its territory. The circulating movement of the Carnival parade is also an extending of space through sound. Territorializing the space through sounds of African beats, such as the pan, fosters a sense of identity and unity for the overall Carnival.<ref name=\"The Sounding\" />\n\nThe Carnival further diversified in 1984 with the appearance of the London School of Samba. Formed in that year, they were the first samba school in the UK and have paraded every year since (with the exception of 1992). Other samba schools have also paraded in Carnival, notably Acad\u00eamicos de Madureira (1992\u201394), Quilombo do Samba (1993\u20132006) & the Paraiso School of Samba (since 2002). These groups are also notable as they sometimes parade with more than 200 performers, along with several decorated floats.\n\n== Public order ==\nSince the carnival did not have local authority permission, initial police involvement was aimed at preventing it taking place at all, which resulted in regular confrontation and riots. In 1976, the police had been expecting hostility due to what they deemed as trouble the year before. Consequently, after discovering pickpockets in the crowd, police took a heavy-handed approach against the large congregation of black people and it became \"no-man's land\". The 1600-strong police force violently broke up the carnival, with the arrest of 60 people. In the aftermath of the event, the carnival was portrayed in a very pointed way, with those aiding the riots lumped together as the \"trouble-makers\" responsible.<ref>Sarah Phillips, [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/mar/13/robert-golden-best-photograph \"Robert Golden's best photograph: the 1976 Notting Hill carnival riots\"], ''The Guardian'', 13 March 2013.</ref> \n\nAfter the 1976 Notting Hill Carnival the [[Police Federation of England and Wales|Police Federation]] pressed for the introduction of riot shields to protect police from objects thrown at them, although the shields also had the potential for aggressive use, as in 1977.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=rj7TrpWFVjQC&pg=PA739&lpg=PA739&dq=notting+hill+carnival&source=bl&ots=1yRRuZvOc7&sig=hvXQQRsa3O-zgjMWY66aA80cnzE&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjNoJqFu-_VAhWIF8AKHd7qAVIQ6AEIYzAN#v=onepage&q=notting%20hill%20carnival&f=false \"Riot shields \u2013 protective or aggressive?\"], ''[[New Scientist]]'' (Vol. 75, No. 1070), 22 September 1977, p. 739.</ref><ref>Roger Fowler,\n [https://books.google.com/books?id=bX5GAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA248&lpg=PA248&dq=notting+hill+carnival&source=bl&ots=HzDqP2U0_W&sig=khBvsA8qZAC32l3qq8192FDuMq8&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjHlai3v-_VAhXmK8AKHZNIAjAQ6AEIVjAK#v=snippet&q=notting%20hill%20carnival&f=false ''Language in the News: Discourse and Ideology in the Press''], p. 248.</ref><ref>Tony Moore, ''Policing Notting Hill: Fifty Years of Turbulence'', Waterside Press, 2013, p. 195.</ref>\nA change of policy came after a confrontation in 1987, when the Carnival was allowed to take place with police adopting a more conciliatory approach.
