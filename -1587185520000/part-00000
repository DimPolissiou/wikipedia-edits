Bonville's father died before Bonville reached adulthood. As a result, he grew up in the household of his grandfather and namesake, who was a prominent member of the Devon gentry. Both Bonville's father and grandfather had been successful in politics and land acquisition, and when Bonville came of age, he gained control of a large estate. He augmented this further by a series of lawsuits against his mother's second husband. Bonville undertook royal service, which then meant fighting in France in the later years of the [[Hundred Years' War]]. In 1415, he joined the [[Hundred Years' War (1415\u20131453)|English invasion of France]] in the retinue of [[Thomas, Duke of Clarence]], [[Henry V of England|Henry V]]'s brother, and fought on the [[Battle of Agincourt|Agincourt campaign]]. Throughout his life, Bonville was despatched on further operations in France, but increasingly events in the southwest of England took up more of his time and energy, as he became [[Bonville\u2013Courtenay feud|involved in a feud]] with his powerful neighbour [[Thomas de Courtenay, 5th Earl of Devon|Thomas Courtenay, Earl of Devon]].\n\nIn 1437, King [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] granted Bonville the profitable office of steward of the [[Duchy of Cornwall]]. This had traditionally been a hereditary office of the earls of Devon, and the Earl was enraged at its loss. The dispute soon descended into violence, and Bonville and Courtenay ravaged each other's properties. The situation was exacerbated in 1442 when the Crown appointed Courtenay to effectively the same stewardship it had appointed Bonville, which inflamed the situation even more. The feud between them continued intermittently for the next decade. Generally, Henry and his government failed to intervene between the two parties; when it did, its efforts were ineffectual. On one occasion Bonville was persuaded to undertake further service in France\u2014primarily to get Bonville out of the region\u2014but the mission was poorly funded, a military failure, and when Bonville returned the feud reignited. In 1453, King Henry became ill and entered a [[catatonic state]] for eighteen months, heightening the political factionalism that had riven the reign.\n\nBonville generally seems to have remained loyal to the king, although his guiding motivation was to support whoever would aid him in his struggle against Courtenay. Their feud was part of a broader breakdown in law and order which eventually evolved into the [[Wars of the Roses]] in 1455. Bonville seems to have managed to avoid implication in the variable swings in political fortune which followed until 1460. At this point, he threw in his lot with the rebellious [[Richard, Duke of York]]. His new allegiance brought him little profit; his son was killed alongside York at the [[Battle of Wakefield]] in December 1460, while Bonville himself took part in the [[Second Battle of St Albans]] two months later on the losing side; with [[Thomas Courtenay, 6th Earl of Devon|the new Earl of Devon]] watching, he was [[Decapitation|beheaded]] on 18 February 1461.\n\n== Background and early life ==\nThe Bonvilles were one of the major [[gentry]] families of late-fourteenth-century Devon, often working in close co-operation with their neighbours. The most important of these were the [[House of Courtenay|Courtenay]] [[Earl of Devon|earls of Devon]]. Bonville's grandfather had been a [[Retainer (medieval)|retainer]] of the 11th Earl, [[Edward de Courtenay, 3rd/11th Earl of Devon|Edward]]. The historian [[Christine Carpenter (historian)|Christine Carpenter]] comments, on the family's social position, that they were of sufficiently \"landed and official status to be regarded as what might be termed 'super-knights'{{tsp}}\";{{Sfn|Carpenter|2012|p=76}} she echoed the medievalist [[K. B. McFarlane]], who had previously described the family as \"a powerful and respected element in Devon...there was no need for them to stand in dread of the great, for they were not small themselves\".{{Sfn|McFarlane|1981|p=16}}\n[[File:OldShuteHouseGreatHallFromWest.jpg|upright=1.2|alt=Late fourteenth-century section of Bonville's birthplace.|left|thumb|Very little of the original medieval manor house remains of Bonville's birthplace; the section shown here is from the late fourteenth century.]]\nWilliam Bonville was born on either 12 or 31 August 1392{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} or 1393 in [[Shute, Devon]], to John Bonville (d. 1396) and Elizabeth Fitzroger (c. 1370\u2013c. 1414).{{Sfn|Cokayne|1912|p=218}} William Bonville's grandfather was his namesake Sir William Bonville, who had been [[member of Parliament]] for [[Somerset]] and Devon on multiple occasions{{Sfn|Roskell|Clark|Rawcliffe|1993a}} and has been described by a historian as one of \"the most prominent west-country gentry in the late fourteenth century\".{{Sfn|Cherry|2004}} On hearing of the birth of his grandson, a contemporary reports, Sir William \"raised his hands to heaven and praised God\".{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Along with the [[Newenham Abbey|Abbot of Newenham]], he stood [[godparent]] to the young William.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} The younger William was heir to both his father and grandfather; the latter\u2014who had married twice\u2014had substantially expanded the family [[Inheritance|patrimony]].{{Sfn|Cherry|2004}} He has been described by the scholar [[Ralph A. Griffiths|Ralph Griffiths]] as a \"capable, energetic and well-connected man\".{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=574}}\n\nBonville's father died when his son was four,{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} and young William probably grew up in his grandfather's household.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Grandfather Bonville died in 1408,{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} while Bonville was still legally a [[Minor (law)|minor]].{{Sfn|Cokayne|1912|p=218}} As was customary, [[Henry IV of England|King Henry IV]] took both Bonville's [[Ward (law)|wardship]] and marriage into his own hands. This was valuable [[Royal Patronage|royal patronage]],{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=153}} which the King granted firstly to Sir [[John Tiptoft, 1st Baron Tiptoft|John Tiptoft]],{{Sfn|Roskell|1983|p=111}} and then to [[Edward, Duke of York]].{{Sfn|Cherry|2004}} Bonville had a younger brother, Thomas, who, by the time William came of age, had already married a cousin of [[Robert Poynings|Robert, Baron Poynings]]. This connection to the Poynings family, the historian [[J. S. Roskell]] has suggested, was instrumental in Bonville's own marriage.{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=153}}\n\n=== Marriages and children ===\nBonville married twice. In 1414 he married Margaret Grey, daughter of [[Reginald Grey, 3rd Baron Grey de Ruthyn|Reginald, Baron Grey of Ruthin]].{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=574}} Lord Grey promised to pay 200 marks{{Refn|A medieval English mark was an [[Unit of account|accounting unit]] equivalent to two-thirds of a pound.{{sfn|Harding|2002|p=xiv}}|group=note}} to Bonville on the wedding day, and Bonville likewise contracted to settle estates to the value of \u00a3100 on himself and his wife, [[Jointure|jointly]]. Grey also paid another 200 marks in instalments over the following four years.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Sometime between April 1426 and October 1427{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=153}}\u2014when Bonville received a [[papal dispensation]] to marry again\u2014Margaret Grey died. Bonville made his next marriage to Elizabeth Courtenay, widow of [[John Harington, 4th Baron Harington|John, Baron Harington]]. Elizabeth was the daughter of Bonville's grandfather's local associate, Edward Earl of Devon.{{Sfn|Cokayne|1912|pp=218\u2013219}} The couple required a dispensation to marry because Elizabeth was already a godmother to one of Bonville's daughters; in the eyes of the church, this placed her within a prohibited degree of [[consanguinity]].{{sfn|Attreed|2001|p=128}} Elizabeth was already well connected\u2014her brother-in-law was Lord Harington, and the Earl of Devon her nephew{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}}\u2014and this marriage greatly increased Bonville's links to the [[Peerage of England|peerage]].\n\nBonville's son and heir by Margaret, also named [[William Bonville, 6th Baron Harington|William]], married Lord Harington's only daughter Elizabeth around 1443.{{sfn|Kleineke|2015|p=121}} Two of Bonville's daughters\u2014Margaret and Philippa{{Refn|name=\"P\"|group=note}}\u2014married William Courtenay and William Grenville respectively; they were both scions of cadet branches of the Courtenay family. Bonville's third daughter, Elizabeth,{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} married an important Midlands landowner, [[William Tailboys|Sir William Tailboys]] by November 1446.{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=580}} These marriages further enhanced Bonville's aristocratic and political connections.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}}\n\nBonville had an illegitimate son, John, by Isabel Kirkby.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} John married Alice Denys and was [[Financial endowment|endowed]] in 1453.{{sfn|Kleineke|2015|p=122}} On Bonville's death, he bequesthed John a \"substantial\" property. He died in 1499.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} {{Location map|Devon|width=230|float=right|caption=The location of Shute, Bonville's birthplace, within Devon and England.|label=Shute|mark=Red_pog.svg|lat_deg=|lon_deg=|lat=50.7712|long=-3.0602}}\n\n=== Estates and wealth ===\nBonville's father and grandfather had both had successful careers.{{Sfn|Roskell|Clark|Rawcliffe|1993a}} As such, when Bonville [[Age of majority|came of age]] in 1414{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=153}} he inherited an income of approximately \u00a3900 per annum; for context, the historian [[Martin Cherry]] says this was \"a figure not far short of that enjoyed by the fifteenth-century earls of Devon themselves\".{{Sfn|Cherry|2004}} His lands\u2014comprising 18 manors{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=153}}\u2014were situated all over England, although concentrated in Devon, particularly around Shute in the southeast of the county, and Somerset.{{Sfn|Cherry|2004}} These lands encompassed his grandfather's patrimony, with manors in Devon, Somerset, Dorset and [[Wiltshire]]. The Fitzroger estates were mainly in [[Leicestershire]], the [[East Midlands]], and the southeast of England in [[Kent]] and [[Sussex]].{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}}\n\nDue to the deaths of their husbands in 1396 and 1408 respectively,{{sfn|Roskell|1954|p=153}} Bonville's mother and grandmother each held a third of his inheritance in [[dower]].{{Refn|The legal concept of dower had existed since the late twelfth century as a means of protecting a woman from being left landless if her husband died first. He would, when they married, assign certain estates to her\u2014a ''dos nominata'', or dower\u2014usually a third of everything he was [[seisin|seised]] of. By the fifteenth century, the widow was deemed entitled to her dower;{{sfn|Kenny|2003|pp=59\u201360}} the historian [[Rowena Archer]] argues that this made it \"one of the most destructive of baronial incidents\" on account of how a long-lived [[dowager]] could reduce an inheritance over generations.{{sfn|Archer|1984|p=16}}|group=note}} His mother had remarried in 1397, to [[Richard Stucley]],{{refn|Also spelled Styuecle.{{Sfn|Roskell|Clark|Rawcliffe|1993b}}|group=note}} an important [[Essex]] landowner. In 1410 she granted Stucley a life-interest in her inheritance, with [[remainder (law)|remainder]] to their children.{{Sfn|Roskell|Clark|Rawcliffe|1993b}} On her death in April 1414{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=153}} Stucley thereby gained Devon lands worth around \u00a3105 per annum{{Sfn|Roskell|Clark|Rawcliffe|1993b}} as well as Wiltshire manors of the Bonville estate, including the valuable manor of [[Chewton Mendip|Chewton]]. Stucley based his claim on the tradition of [[Courtesy of England|courtesy]]. On reaching his legal majority, Bonville sued his stepfather for his maternal inheritance. This struggle took over six years, but he succeeded in establishing his rights to the estates by 1422. Bonville's grandmother survived until 1426; by then Bonville had also inherited substantial estates from other relatives, including a cousin and an aunt. These brought him the manors of [[Yelverton, Devon|Yelverton]] and [[Mudford Sock]], and as a result, says the ''[[History of Parliament]]'', \"without doubt Bonville ranked among the very wealthiest landowners of the West Country\".{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}}\n\n== Political career and royal service ==\n[[File:Taunton Castle 03.jpg|upright=1.2|alt=Taunton Castle in 2017|thumb|The main gate, in 2017, of Bonville's castle at Taunton, which was besieged by the Earl of Devon|left]]\nBonville undertook [[Hundred Years' War|royal service in France]] in 1415, and joined Henry V's [[Battle of Agincourt|Agincourt campaign]], travelling in the [[retinue]] of the King's brother, [[Thomas, Duke of Clarence]]. While in [[Normandy]], sometime before his seventeenth birthday, Bonville was knighted.{{Sfn|Cokayne|1912|p=218}}{{refn|It is unknown, however, whether Bonville fought in the Battle of Agincourt itself. The historian [[Clifford J. Rogers]] notes that the numbers known to have begun the campaign had been reduced by early losses, sickness and those otherwise invalided\nto England after the [[Siege of Harfleur]] in particular.{{sfn|Rogers|2008|p=52}}|group=note}}\n\nIn 1421, Bonville acted as one of the Duke of Clarence's [[executor]]s following the latter's death at the [[Battle of Baug\u00e9]]. Roskell suggests that Bonville must have been greatly trusted by Clarence\u2014at the time of his death, [[heir presumptive]] to the English throne\u2014because the Duke had borrowed money from Bonville.{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=153}} Bonville had returned to England before May, when he attended parliament at [[Westminster Hall|Westminster]].{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Henry V died in France in August 1422 leaving his six-month-old son [[Henry VI of England|Henry]] as his heir, and his surviving brothers, [[John, Duke of Bedford]] and [[Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester]] as the baby King's [[regents]].{{sfn|Matusiak|2012|pp=232\u2013233}}{{refn|Clarence had predeceased King Henry, having been killed at the [[Battle of Baug\u00e9]] the previous year.{{sfn|Matusiak|2012|p=218}}|group=note}} The war in France continued in spite of Henry VI's youth, and Bonville returned in 1423 in Gloucester's army. Bonville fought in the campaign to regain [[Le Crotoy]], bringing with him a retinue of ten [[Man-at-arms|men-at-arms]] and 30 archers.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}}\n\nOn his return to England, much of Bonville's time was occupied with the administration of his estates. Extensive as they were, there was occasional friction\u2014some of it violent\u2014with his neighbours.{{Sfn|Cokayne|1912|p=218}} In 1427 he was engaged in a bitter feud with [[Thomas Brooke (died 1439)|Sir Thomas Brooke]], whom Bonville\u2014described as a \"thrusting and able man\"{{Sfn|Wilkinson|1995|p=311}}\u2014accused of unilaterally [[Enclosure|enclosing]] parkland in [[Axmouth]] and obstructing roads that Bonville's tenants needed to use. The matter went to the [[arbitration]] of Bonville's godfather, the Abbot of Newenham, who found against Brooke, who had to pay all Bonville's legal costs and reverse his enclosure.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} By now, Bonville was also a royal official, having been appointed [[Sheriff of Devon]] in 1423,{{Sfn|Cokayne|1912|p=218}} although he received few other [[Royal Commission|commissions]] in the county before 1430.{{Refn|Prior to the 1430s, he was only appointed to [[Commission of array|commissions of array]] for [[Dorset]] in April 1418 and March 1419.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}}|group=note}} From then on he was regularly occupied with his duties as a royal official in the region: he was a [[justice of the peace]] for Devon from July 1431, for Somerset from March 1435, and for Cornwall from November 1438.{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=154}} Other commissions included local inquiries into [[necromancy]], piracy, [[extortion]], [[desertion]] (from the [[Richard Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick|Earl of Warwick's]] fleet in 1438), [[felonies]], smuggling, and [[Concealment of treasure trove|concealment of treasure]].{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}}\n\nIn 1437 King Henry VI's minority ended, and he began his personal rule. Bonville was appointed to the [[King's Council]], being described as a \"King's knight\".{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} He was zealous in combating piracy off the Cornish coast, to such an extent that in 1454 the [[Philip the Good|Duke of Burgundy]] made an official complaint to the English government about the treatment meted out to Burgundian shipping in the area.{{sfn|Cherry|1979|p=95}} In 1440 Bonville, with Sir Philip Courtenay\u2014a close friend of Bonville's{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=574}}\u2014commanded a small fleet{{Sfn|Barker|2009|p=305}} of thirty [[galley]]s to patrol the [[English Channel|Channel]]. They saw little action; the occasional encounters with the enemy did not necessarily go in their favour, as on one occasion rival Portuguese merchants captured two ships from Bonville's fleet.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}}\n\n=== Feud with the Earl of Devon ===\n{{See also|Bonville\u2013Courtenay feud}}\n\n==== 1437\u20131440 ====\nIn 1437, Bonville was appointed [[Steward (office)|Steward]] of the [[Cornwall|county of Cornwall]] for life, for which he received a salary of 40 [[Mark (currency)|marks]] yearly.{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=154}} This immediately made him an enemy of the young Earl of Devon, [[Thomas de Courtenay, 5th/13th Earl of Devon|Thomas Courtenay]];{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|pp=574\u2013575}} Courtenay's wealth was already reduced by his mother's dower,{{Sfn|Archer|1984|p=26}}{{Refn|Courtenay had been born in 1414, had come of age in 1425, but his mother, Anne Talbot, survived until 1441. During this time she controlled,{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=574}} through both her dower and [[jointure]]s, approximately two-thirds of the Courtenay inheritance.

During his absence, Courtenay had become increasingly powerful in Devon. The King, though, was revealing himself to be a weak-willed monarch, unwilling\u2014or unable\u2014to impose the [[Peace (law)|King's peace]] in the southwest, or, for that matter, elsewhere. Henry was under the influence of his [[favourite]], [[William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk|William de la Pole, Duke of Suffolk]],{{Sfn|Cherry|2004}} and Suffolk's government could not afford to alienate the Earl of Devon. Conversely, Suffolk was still an attractive ally for Bonville against the Earl,{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=576}} as Bonville's Lincolnshire associate{{sfn|Virgoe|1997|p=291}} and later son-in-law, Tailboys, was closely linked with Suffolk.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}}{{Sfn|Cokayne|1912|p=218}}{{Refn|William Tailboys has been described by the historian [[Roger Virgoe]] as \"exceptionally violent and unscrupulous even for that age\".

In 1444 Bonville joined the duke's retinue to France, where Bonville played a central role in the [[Betrothal|betrothal ceremony]] between King Henry and his bride-to-be, [[Margaret of Anjou]]. By a [[writ]] of 10 March the following year{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=353}} Bonville was elevated to the peerage.{{Sfn|Cokayne|1912|p=218}} This was both in recognition of his successes in France{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=576}}\u2014it had been a \"turbulent period\" in Gascony{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=356}}\u2014but also a reflection of the esteem Suffolk held him in.{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=576}} As Baron Bonville of Chewton; he was summoned to every parliament until the end of his life as ''Willelmo Bonville domino Bonville et de Chuton''.{{Sfn|Cokayne|1912|p=218}} In 1446 Bonville suppressed a revolt in Somerset, in which [[Wells Cathedral]] was attacked by \"insurgents against the peace of the Church and the King\".{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}}\n\nBonville's association with Suffolk was not to last. In early 1450, the duke was [[Impeachment|impeached in the]] House of Lords and [[exile]]d as a result. Suffolk was subsequently murdered ''en route'' to the continent. Roskell notes that, although Bonville is known to have attended this parliament, it remains unknown what position he took\u2014if he took any\u2014on Suffolk's impeachment.{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=154}} One of the most powerful critics of Suffolk's government had been [[Richard, 3rd Duke of York|Richard, Duke of York]], and the Earl of Devon soon allied himself with the duke as a means of furthering his position in the [[West Country]]. Courtenay saw his newly-reinforced position as sufficiently secure to allow him to reignite the feud with Bonville,{{Sfn|Radford|1912|p=254}} who in Taunton was recruiting men to his banner at [[Sixpence (British coin)|sixpence]] a day.{{Sfn|Hicks|1998|p=93}} To this end he launched a series of raids onto Bonville properties, which culminated in Courtenay's [[Besiege|besieging]] of Bonville's [[Taunton Castle]]{{Sfn|Radford|1912|p=254}} with a force of over 5,000 men{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=576}}\u2014a crisis that the contemporary [[chronicle]]r [[William Worcester]] described as \"''maxima perturbatio''\".{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=154}}{{Refn|Translated to English, Worcester described it as \"the greatest disturbance\".{{sfn|Roskell|1954|p=154}}|group=note}} Fighting alongside Courtenay was [[Edward Brooke, 6th Baron Cobham|Edward Brooke, Lord Cobham]], son of the Thomas Brooke whom Bonville had feuded with over a decade previously.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Courtenay's alliance with York was not as strong as the Earl believed, and when York arrived in Devon to restore order, he promptly cast both Bonville and Courtenay, with many of their retainers, into prison{{Sfn|Cherry|2004}} for a month.{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=692}} Bonville was forced to put Taunton Castle into the duke's custody.{{Sfn|Gillingham|1993|p=72}} This particular phase of the feud was suspended by the holding of a [[Loveday (arbitration)|loveday]] (''dies amoris'') between Bonville and Courtenay at [[Colcombe Castle|Colcombe]] in 1451. This was an important enough political event for it to warrant the attendance of [[Richard Woodville, 1st Earl Rivers|Richard, Lord Rivers]] and his wife [[Jacquetta of Luxembourg|Jacquetta, Lady Rivers]] as the King's representatives.{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=596}}\n\nThe Earl of Devon's continuing alliance with York brought Courtenay further problems in 1452. By then, York felt excluded from the government as the King had a new favourite, [[Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset|Edmund, Duke of Somerset]]. In February that year York rebelled and marched on London with a large force. He faced the King's army at [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]], southeast of London. Courtenay stood alongside him. Somerset and much of the rest of the nobility faced York and Courtenay down: they surrendered without a fight.{{Sfn|Radford|1912|p=255}} Bonville had raised a body of men to join the King's army,{{Sfn|Goodman|1981|p=20}} and subsequently profited from Courtenay's disfavour with the King.{{sfn|Carpenter|1997|p=128}} The historian [[A. J. Pollard]] suggests that Bonville was given \"a free hand\" in the region as a result of York's and Devon's eclipse{{Sfn|Pollard|2000|p=136}} and according to Cherry, this allowed Bonville to become the predominant figure in county politics.{{Sfn|Cherry|1981b|p=132}} He was commissioned to oversee the arrest and prosecution of the Earl of Devon's men after Blackheath, and the following year King Henry demonstrated the esteem Bonville stood in when, during Henry's [[royal progress]] through the southwest, he stayed at Bonville's [[Caput baroniae|''caput'']] of Shute.{{Sfn|Wolffe|1981|p=259}} Bonville received further offices and responsibilities. He was confirmed as steward of the Duchy of Cornwall, reappointed seneschal of Gascony and also made [[lieutenant of Aquitaine]]). Bonville has been described by historians connected to ''The [[Gascon Rolls]] Project'' as being \"an excellent choice for lieutenant\"{{sfn|Gascon Rolls|2014}}{{refn|The office of lieutenant of Aquitaine went back to at least 1278,{{sfn|Gascon Rolls|2014}} and since the [[Duke of Aquitaine]] was also King of England, the lieutenant ruled directly on the King's behalf. It was a royal appointment, usually to a close relative of the King, although it was a sporadic one, being mostly filled during periods of war or civil disturbance.{{sfn|Gribit|2016|p=13}} It was not a particularly profitable office, notes the economist [[Michael Postan]], and indeed was \"as likely to be a source of loss as gain\" for the appointee, and the King was regularly forced to provide financial inducements to those he wished to take up the post.{{sfn|Postan|1973|p=74}}|group=note}} and received the constableship of [[Exeter Castle]].{{Sfn|Storey|1999|p=165}} He also received grants of lands and estates in [[South Teign River|South Teign]], the [[Lydford Castle|castle]], borough and [[manor]] of Lydford, the [[conservancy]] of the [[River Exe]], and [[forestry rights]] in [[Dartmoor]],{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=154}} making him, wrote the historian [[Bertram Wolffe]], \"exalted in the west country\".{{Sfn|Wolffe|1981|p=262}} Bonville never took up his seneschalcy as what remained of England's territorial possessions in France were lost at the [[Battle of Castillon]] in July 1453.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} King Henry\u2014now in Exeter\u2014appointed Bonville to a large commission of [[oyer and terminer]] to investigate sympathy for York's rebellion in the area, and the King made him a gift of \u00a350.{{Sfn|Wolffe|1981|pp=259\u2013260}}\n\n=== Henry's illness and Yorkist government ===\n[[File:MapBattleOfClystHeath1455.PNG|thumb|upright=1.2|alt=map showing location of the Clyst battlefield in Devon|Map of the location of the Clyst engagement, 1455]]In August 1453, King Henry suffered a period of illness and mental collapse during which he was unable to respond to people or stimulus. He was, therefore, unable to carry out his royal duties. The Lancastrian regime, already weakened by factionalism, was paralysed,{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=715}} and the national political scene became increasingly tense. Bonville attended a council at Westminster in early 1454. This, a [[Paston Letters|Paston]] correspondent reported, was only after he had \"maken all the puissance they can and may to come hider [to Westminster] with theym\".{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=723}} It was rumoured that Bonville was planning to join up with other lords\u2014those of Beaumont, Poynings, Clifford and Egremont\u2014and march on London itself, although in the event this did not occur.{{Sfn|Jacob|1993|p=508}}{{Refn|In other words, it was rumoured that Bonville ordered the gathering of the largest force of men (a ''puissaunce''{{sfn|MED|2014a}}) that he could, and that having done so, he brought them (''hider''{{sfn|MED|2014b}}) to Westminster with him; from a letter of 19 January 1454 from John Studley to John Paston.{{sfn|Gairdner|1986|p=299}}|group=note}} Everyone, including Bonville, was preparing for war on a national scale.{{Sfn|Tuck|1999|p=271}}\n\nThe [[House of Lords]] eventually appointed the Duke of York as [[Lord Protector|protector]] of the realm during the King's incapacitation, and York appointed Salisbury [[Lord Chancellor|chancellor]]. Although Courtenay was nominally York's ally, the Earl did not see any major benefits from this relationship. (York's other allies, argues John Watts, the Nevilles, received York's assistance in their on-going feud with the Percies in Yorkshire.) Bonville experienced no lessening of his position during the protectorate;{{Sfn|Watts|1996|pp=324 + n.274, 338 n.328}} indeed, he had committed flagrant acts of piracy against foreign shipping off the southwest coast, which went unpunished. The most prominent victims of Bonville's actions were the Duke of Burgundy's merchants; Burgundy was England's ally on the continent, a position which Bonville's ships endangered.{{Sfn|Johnson|1988|p=151}}\n\n=== Battle of St Albans and Bonville's ascendency ===\nIn early 1455 King Henry made a sudden recovery. York and Salisbury were removed from their positions in government and retired to their estates. National politics, already heavily partisan, was tense. The King summoned a great council to be held in Leicester in May. Several chroniclers of the day suggest that Somerset was poisoning the King's mind against York.{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=740}} He and the Nevilles may have feared imminent arrest. In any case, they reacted swiftly and with violence. They ambushed the King's small army at the [[First Battle of St Albans]] on the 22nd in a [[pre-emptive strike]]. Courtenay fought for the King and was wounded.{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=155}} Bonville may also have been sympathetic to the royal cause, as one of his [[pursuivant]]s was used as a messenger by the King's councillors. He did not join the royal army, however.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Michael Hicks has suggested that both Bonville and Courtenay were more interested in prosecuting their own feud than the national one.{{Sfn|Hicks|1998|p=94}} King Henry had been captured by the Yorkists after the battle: once again they controlled the government.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Although clearly unwilling to turn against his King at this point,{{Sfn|Grummitt|2013|p=59}} Bonville did attend the Yorkist parliament of September 1455, where he voted in favour of the Duke of York's appointment as protector.{{Sfn|Griffiths|1984|p=78}} Bonville was appointed to the parliamentary committee set up to improve naval defence.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} He also used his local influence to ensure that the vacant [[Bishop of Exeter|Bishopric of Exeter]] was reserved for the Earl of Salisbury's youngest son, [[George Neville (Archbishop)|George Neville]],{{Sfn|Pollard|2000|p=149}} and in November Bonville received a general [[Royal pardon|pardon]].{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=770 n.202}}\n\nIn the southwest, Bonville and his ally, [[James Butler, 5th Earl of Ormond|James Butler, Earl of Wiltshire]] (also at this time very close to the court) were recruiting heavily.{{Sfn|Grummitt|2013|p=36}} They caused a proclamation \"to be cryed at Taunton in Somersetshire that every man that is likely and wole go with theym and serve theym shalle have ''vjd.''

The plan failed, but Bonville was prevented from carrying out his duty as a collector of a royal loan.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Although in the following June both Bonville and Courtenay were instructed by the King to keep the peace\u2014and each bound over for \u00a34,000 to do so\u2014they appear to have continued their war of attrition. Such was the \"anarchic state of affairs\"{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} in Devon following St Albans that the [[Michaelmas term]] judicial sessions that were due to be held in Exeter had to be cancelled. Courtenay went on to terrorise the county with his army and ransacked Bonville's houses.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} This culminated on 23 October 1455 with what has been described as the \"most notorious private crime of the century\",{{sfn|Storey|1999|p=167}} when Courtenay's son\u2014also [[Thomas Courtenay, 6th/14th Earl of Devon|Thomas]]\u2014and a small force of men attacked and brutally murdered one of Bonville's close councillors, the prominent local lawyer [[Nicholas Radford]].{{sfn|Storey|1999|p=168}} Carpenter comments: \"there were other enormities, principally directed against Lord Bonville.

Bonville's father died before Bonville reached adulthood. As a result, he grew up in the household of his grandfather and namesake, who was a prominent member of the Devon gentry. Both Bonville's father and grandfather had been successful in politics and land acquisition, and when Bonville came of age, he gained control of a large estate. He augmented this further by a series of lawsuits against his mother's second husband. Bonville undertook royal service, which then meant fighting in France in the later years of the [[Hundred Years' War]]. In 1415, he joined the [[Hundred Years' War (1415\u20131453)|English invasion of France]] in the retinue of [[Thomas, Duke of Clarence]], [[Henry V of England|Henry V]]'s brother, and fought on the [[Battle of Agincourt|Agincourt campaign]]. Throughout his life, Bonville was despatched on further operations in France, but increasingly events in the southwest of England took up more of his time and energy, as he became [[Bonville\u2013Courtenay feud|involved in a feud]] with his powerful neighbour [[Thomas de Courtenay, 5th Earl of Devon|Thomas Courtenay, Earl of Devon]].\n\nIn 1437, King [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] granted Bonville the profitable office of steward of the [[Duchy of Cornwall]]. This had traditionally been a hereditary office of the earls of Devon, and the Earl was enraged at its loss. The dispute soon descended into violence, and Bonville and Courtenay ravaged each other's properties. The situation was exacerbated in 1442 when the Crown appointed Courtenay to effectively the same stewardship it had appointed Bonville, which inflamed the situation even more. The feud between them continued intermittently for the next decade. Generally, Henry and his government failed to intervene between the two parties; when it did, its efforts were ineffectual. On one occasion Bonville was persuaded to undertake further service in France\u2014primarily to get Bonville out of the region\u2014but the mission was poorly funded, a military failure, and when Bonville returned the feud reignited. In 1453, King Henry became ill and entered a [[catatonic state]] for eighteen months, heightening the political factionalism that had riven the reign.\n\nBonville generally seems to have remained loyal to the king, although his guiding motivation was to support whoever would aid him in his struggle against Courtenay. Their feud was part of a broader breakdown in law and order which eventually evolved into the [[Wars of the Roses]] in 1455. Bonville seems to have managed to avoid implication in the variable swings in political fortune which followed until 1460. At this point, he threw in his lot with the rebellious [[Richard, Duke of York]]. His new allegiance brought him little profit; his son was killed alongside York at the [[Battle of Wakefield]] in December 1460, while Bonville himself took part in the [[Second Battle of St Albans]] two months later on the losing side; with [[Thomas Courtenay, 6th Earl of Devon|the new Earl of Devon]] watching, he was [[Decapitation|beheaded]] on 18 February 1461.\n\n== Background and early life ==\nThe Bonvilles were one of the major [[gentry]] families of late-fourteenth-century Devon, often working in close co-operation with their neighbours. The most important of these were the [[House of Courtenay|Courtenay]] [[Earl of Devon|earls of Devon]]. Bonville's grandfather had been a [[Retainer (medieval)|retainer]] of the 11th Earl, [[Edward de Courtenay, 3rd/11th Earl of Devon|Edward]]. The historian [[Christine Carpenter (historian)|Christine Carpenter]] comments, on the family's social position, that they were of sufficiently \"landed and official status to be regarded as what might be termed 'super-knights'{{tsp}}\";{{Sfn|Carpenter|2012|p=76}} she echoed the medievalist [[K. B. McFarlane]], who had previously described the family as \"a powerful and respected element in Devon...there was no need for them to stand in dread of the great, for they were not small themselves\".{{Sfn|McFarlane|1981|p=16}}\n[[File:OldShuteHouseGreatHallFromWest.jpg|upright=1.2|alt=Late fourteenth-century section of Bonville's birthplace.|left|thumb|Very little of the original medieval manor house remains of Bonville's birthplace; the section shown here is from the late fourteenth century.]]\nWilliam Bonville was born on either 12 or 31 August 1392{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} or 1393 in [[Shute, Devon]], to John Bonville (d. 1396) and Elizabeth Fitzroger (c. 1370\u2013c. 1414).{{Sfn|Cokayne|1912|p=218}} William Bonville's grandfather was his namesake Sir William Bonville, who had been [[member of Parliament]] for [[Somerset]] and Devon on multiple occasions{{Sfn|Roskell|Clark|Rawcliffe|1993a}} and has been described by a historian as one of \"the most prominent west-country gentry in the late fourteenth century\".{{Sfn|Cherry|2004}} On hearing of the birth of his grandson, a contemporary reports, Sir William \"raised his hands to heaven and praised God\".{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Along with the [[Newenham Abbey|Abbot of Newenham]], he stood [[godparent]] to the young William.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} The younger William was heir to both his father and grandfather; the latter\u2014who had married twice\u2014had substantially expanded the family [[Inheritance|patrimony]].{{Sfn|Cherry|2004}} He has been described by the scholar [[Ralph A. Griffiths|Ralph Griffiths]] as a \"capable, energetic and well-connected man\".{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=574}}\n\nBonville's father died when his son was four,{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} and young William probably grew up in his grandfather's household.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Grandfather Bonville died in 1408,{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} while Bonville was still legally a [[Minor (law)|minor]].{{Sfn|Cokayne|1912|p=218}} As was customary, [[Henry IV of England|King Henry IV]] took both Bonville's [[Ward (law)|wardship]] and marriage into his own hands. This was valuable [[Royal Patronage|royal patronage]],{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=153}} which the King granted firstly to Sir [[John Tiptoft, 1st Baron Tiptoft|John Tiptoft]],{{Sfn|Roskell|1983|p=111}} and then to [[Edward, Duke of York]].{{Sfn|Cherry|2004}} Bonville had a younger brother, Thomas, who, by the time William came of age, had already married a cousin of [[Robert Poynings|Robert, Baron Poynings]]. This connection to the Poynings family, the historian [[J. S. Roskell]] has suggested, was instrumental in Bonville's own marriage.{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=153}}\n\n=== Marriages and children ===\nBonville married twice. In 1414 he married Margaret Grey, daughter of [[Reginald Grey, 3rd Baron Grey de Ruthyn|Reginald, Baron Grey of Ruthin]].{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=574}} Lord Grey promised to pay 200 marks{{Refn|A medieval English mark was an [[Unit of account|accounting unit]] equivalent to two-thirds of a pound.{{sfn|Harding|2002|p=xiv}}|group=note}} to Bonville on the wedding day, and Bonville likewise contracted to settle estates to the value of \u00a3100 on himself and his wife, [[Jointure|jointly]]. Grey also paid another 200 marks in instalments over the following four years.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Sometime between April 1426 and October 1427{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=153}}\u2014when Bonville received a [[papal dispensation]] to marry again\u2014Margaret Grey died. Bonville made his next marriage to Elizabeth Courtenay, widow of [[John Harington, 4th Baron Harington|John, Baron Harington]].

He was, therefore, unable to carry out his royal duties. The Lancastrian regime, already weakened by factionalism, was paralysed,{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=715}} and the national political scene became increasingly tense. Bonville attended a council at Westminster in early 1454. This, a [[Paston Letters|Paston]] correspondent reported, was only after he had \"maken all the puissance they can and may to come hider [to Westminster] with theym\".{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=723}} It was rumoured that Bonville was planning to join up with other lords\u2014those of Beaumont, Poynings, Clifford and Egremont\u2014and march on London itself, although in the event this did not occur.{{Sfn|Jacob|1993|p=508}}{{Refn|In other words, it was rumoured that Bonville ordered the gathering of the largest force of men (a ''puissaunce''{{sfn|MED|2014a}}) that he could, and that having done so, he brought them (''hider''{{sfn|MED|2014b}}) to Westminster with him; from a letter of 19 January 1454 from John Studley to John Paston.{{sfn|Gairdner|1986|p=299}}|group=note}} Everyone, including Bonville, was preparing for war on a national scale.{{Sfn|Tuck|1999|p=271}}\n\nThe [[House of Lords]] eventually appointed the Duke of York as [[Lord Protector|protector]] of the realm during the King's incapacitation, and York appointed Salisbury [[Lord Chancellor|chancellor]]. Although Courtenay was nominally York's ally, the Earl did not see any major benefits from this relationship. (York's other allies, argues John Watts, the Nevilles, received York's assistance in their on-going feud with the Percies in Yorkshire.) Bonville experienced no lessening of his position during the protectorate;{{Sfn|Watts|1996|pp=324 + n.274, 338 n.328}} indeed, he had committed flagrant acts of piracy against foreign shipping off the southwest coast, which went unpunished. The most prominent victims of Bonville's actions were the Duke of Burgundy's merchants; Burgundy was England's ally on the continent, a position which Bonville's ships endangered.{{Sfn|Johnson|1988|p=151}}\n\n=== Battle of St Albans and Bonville's ascendency ===\nIn early 1455 King Henry made a sudden recovery. York and Salisbury were removed from their positions in government and retired to their estates. National politics, already heavily partisan, was tense. The King summoned a great council to be held in Leicester in May. Several chroniclers of the day suggest that Somerset was poisoning the King's mind against York.{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=740}} He and the Nevilles may have feared imminent arrest. In any case, they reacted swiftly and with violence. They ambushed the King's small army at the [[First Battle of St Albans]] on the 22nd in a [[pre-emptive strike]]. Courtenay fought for the King and was wounded.{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=155}} Bonville may also have been sympathetic to the royal cause, as one of his [[pursuivant]]s was used as a messenger by the King's councillors. He did not join the royal army, however.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Michael Hicks has suggested that both Bonville and Courtenay were more interested in prosecuting their own feud than the national one.{{Sfn|Hicks|1998|p=94}} King Henry had been captured by the Yorkists after the battle: once again they controlled the government.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Although clearly unwilling to turn against his King at this point,{{Sfn|Grummitt|2013|p=59}} Bonville did attend the Yorkist parliament of September 1455, where he voted in favour of the Duke of York's appointment as protector.{{Sfn|Griffiths|1984|p=78}} Bonville was appointed to the parliamentary committee set up to improve naval defence.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} He also used his local influence to ensure that the vacant [[Bishop of Exeter|Bishopric of Exeter]] was reserved for the Earl of Salisbury's youngest son, [[George Neville (Archbishop)|George Neville]],{{Sfn|Pollard|2000|p=149}} and in November Bonville received a general [[Royal pardon|pardon]].{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=770 n.202}}\n\nIn the southwest, Bonville and his ally, [[James Butler, 5th Earl of Ormond|James Butler, Earl of Wiltshire]] (also at this time very close to the court) were recruiting heavily.{{Sfn|Grummitt|2013|p=36}} They caused a proclamation \"to be cryed at Taunton in Somersetshire that every man that is likely and wole go with theym and serve theym shalle have ''vjd.'' [sixpence] every day as long as he abideth with theym\".{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Bonville's dominance in the southwest forced the Earl of Devon to respond drastically,{{sfn|Storey|1999|p=166}} and at the end of April 1454 Devon brought an armed force of hundreds of men into Exeter in a planned [[ambush]]. The plan failed, but Bonville was prevented from carrying out his duty as a collector of a royal loan.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Although in the following June both Bonville and Courtenay were instructed by the King to keep the peace\u2014and each bound over for \u00a34,000 to do so\u2014they appear to have continued their war of attrition. Such was the \"anarchic state of affairs\"{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} in Devon following St Albans that the [[Michaelmas term]] judicial sessions that were due to be held in Exeter had to be cancelled. Courtenay went on to terrorise the county with his army and ransacked Bonville's houses.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} This culminated on 23 October 1455 with what has been described as the \"most notorious private crime of the century\",{{sfn|Storey|1999|p=167}} when Courtenay's son\u2014also [[Thomas Courtenay, 6th/14th Earl of Devon|Thomas]]\u2014and a small force of men attacked and brutally murdered one of Bonville's close councillors, the prominent local lawyer [[Nicholas Radford]].{{sfn|Storey|1999|p=168}} Carpenter comments: \"there were other enormities, principally directed against Lord Bonville.

It provided propulsion, [[attitude control]], communications, electrical power, but lacked long-term life support functions. Two weeks later, a passive NASA module ''[[Unity (ISS module)|Unity]]'' was launched aboard Space Shuttle flight [[STS-88]] and attached to ''Zarya'' by astronauts during EVAs. This module has two [[Pressurized Mating Adapter|Pressurised Mating Adapters]] (PMAs), one connects permanently to ''Zarya'', the other allowed the Space Shuttle to dock to the space station. At that time, the Russian station ''Mir'' was still inhabited, and the ISS remained uncrewed for two years. On 12 July 2000, ''[[Zvezda (ISS module)|Zvezda]]'' was launched into orbit. Preprogrammed commands on board deployed its solar arrays and communications antenna. It then became the passive target for a rendezvous with ''Zarya'' and ''Unity'': it maintained a station-keeping orbit while the ''Zarya''-''Unity'' vehicle performed the rendezvous and docking via ground control and the Russian automated rendezvous and docking system. ''Zarya''{{'s}} computer transferred control of the station to ''Zvezda''{{'s}} computer soon after docking. ''Zvezda'' added sleeping quarters, a toilet, kitchen, CO<sub>2</sub> scrubbers, dehumidifier, oxygen generators, exercise equipment, plus data, voice and television communications with mission control.

To keep the internal temperature within workable limits, a passive thermal control system (PTCS) is made of external surface materials, insulation such as MLI, and heat pipes. If the PTCS cannot keep up with the heat load, an External Active Thermal Control System (EATCS) maintains the temperature. The EATCS consists of an internal, non-toxic, water coolant loop used to cool and dehumidify the atmosphere, which transfers collected heat into an external liquid [[ammonia]] loop. From the heat exchangers, ammonia is pumped into external radiators that emit heat as infrared radiation, then back to the station.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2001/ast21mar_1/ |title=Staying Cool on the ISS |publisher=NASA |first1=Steve |last1=Price |first2=Tony |last2=Phillips |first3=Gil |last3=Knier |date=21 March 2001 |accessdate=22 July 2016}}</ref> The EATCS provides cooling for all the US pressurised modules, including ''Kib\u014d'' and ''Columbus'', as well as the main power distribution electronics of the S0, S1 and P1 trusses.

Examples of ORUs are pumps, storage tanks, controller boxes, antennas, and battery units. Some units can be replaced using robotic arms. Most are stored outside the station, either on small pallets called [[ExPRESS Logistics Carrier]]s (ELCs) or share larger platforms called [[External Stowage Platform]]s which also hold science experiments. Both kinds of pallets provide electricity for many parts that could be damaged by the cold of space and require heating. The larger logistics carriers also have local area network (LAN) connections for telemetry to connect experiments. A heavy emphasis on stocking the USOS with ORU's occurred around 2011, before the end of the NASA shuttle programme, as its commercial replacements, [[Cygnus (spacecraft)|Cygnus]] and [[SpaceX Dragon|Dragon]], carry one tenth to one quarter the payload.\n\nUnexpected problems and failures have impacted the station's assembly time-line and work schedules leading to periods of reduced capabilities and, in some cases, could have forced abandonment of the station for safety reasons.

From an average distance of about {{convert|70,000|km|abbr=on}}, depending on Solar activity, the [[magnetosphere]] begins to deflect [[solar wind]] around Earth and ISS. [[coronal mass ejection|Solar flares]] are still a hazard to the crew, who may receive only a few minutes warning. In 2005, during the initial 'proton storm' of an X-3 class solar flare, the crew of [[Expedition 10]] took shelter in a more heavily shielded part of the [[Russian Orbital Segment|ROS]] designed for this purpose.<ref>{{cite web |title=Solar Flare Hits Earth and Mars |author=Ker Than |publisher=Space.com |date=23 February 2006 |url=http://www.space.com/2080-solar-flare-hits-earth-mars.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=A new kind of solar storm |publisher=NASA |date=10 June 2005 |url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2005/10jun_newstorm/}}</ref>\n\nSubatomic charged particles, primarily [[proton]]s from [[cosmic ray]]s and solar wind, are normally absorbed by Earth's atmosphere. When they interact in sufficient quantity, their effect is visible to the naked eye in a phenomenon called an [[aurora]]. Outside Earth's atmosphere, crews are exposed to about 1 [[millisievert]] each day, which is about a year of natural exposure on Earth, resulting in a higher risk of cancer. Radiation can penetrate living tissue and damage the [[DNA]] and [[chromosome]]s of [[lymphocytes]]. These cells are central to the [[immune system]], and so any damage to them could contribute to the lower [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] experienced by astronauts. Radiation has also been linked to a higher incidence of [[cataract]]s in astronauts. Protective shielding and drugs may lower risks to an acceptable level.<ref name=\"JCB\"/>\n\nRadiation levels on the ISS are about five times greater than those experienced by airline passengers and crew, as Earth's electromagnetic field provides almost the same level of protection against solar and other radiation in low Earth orbit as in the stratosphere. For example, on a 12-hour flight an airline passenger would experience 0.1 millisieverts of radiation, or a rate of 0.2 millisieverts per day; only 1/5 the rate experienced by an astronaut in LEO. Additionally, airline passengers experience this level of radiation for a few hours of flight, while ISS crew are exposed for their whole stay.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jag.cami.jccbi.gov./cariprofile.asp |title=Galactic Radiation Received in Flight |accessdate=20 May 2010 |publisher=FAA Civil Aeromedical Institute |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329130826/http://jag.cami.jccbi.gov/cariprofile.asp |archivedate=29 March 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Stress===\n[[File:Nikolai Budarin in a sleep station in Zvezda.jpg|thumb|Cosmonaut [[Nikolai Budarin]] at work inside ''[[Zvezda (ISS module)|Zvezda]]'' service module crew quarters]]\nThere is considerable evidence that [[psychosocial]] stressors are among the most important impediments to optimal crew morale and performance.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Peter Suedfeld1 |author2=Kasia E.

Common sources of stress in early US missions included maintaining high performance under public scrutiny and isolation from peers and family. The latter is still often a cause of stress on the ISS, such as when the mother of NASA Astronaut [[Daniel M. Tani|Daniel Tani]] died in a car accident, and when Michael Fincke was forced to miss the birth of his second child.\n\nA study of the longest spaceflight concluded that the first three weeks are a critical period where attention is adversely affected because of the demand to adjust to the extreme change of environment.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Manzey |first1=D. |last2=Lorenz |first2=B. |last3=Poljakov |first3=V. |doi=10.1080/001401398186991 |title=Mental performance in extreme environments: Results from a performance monitoring study during a 438-day spaceflight |journal=Ergonomics |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=537\u2013559 |year=1998 |pmid=9557591 |pmc=}}</ref> ISS crew flights typically last about five to six months.\n\nThe ISS working environment includes further stress caused by living and working in cramped conditions with people from very different cultures who speak a different language.

Specifically, these goals have been the primary focus of the ISS Multilateral Medical Operations Panel (MMOP) Acoustics Subgroup since the first days of ISS assembly and operations.[https://web.archive.org/web/20200220193031/http://emits.sso.esa.int/emits-doc/ESTEC/AO6216-SoW-RD9.pdf]  [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100039608.pdf] The effort includes contributions from [[Acoustical engineering|acoustical engineers]], [[Audiology|audiologists]], [[Industrial Hygienists|industrial hygienists]], and physicians who comprise the subgroup's membership from NASA, the [[Roscosmos|Russian Space Agency]] (RSA), the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA), the [[JAXA|Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency]] (JAXA), and the [[Canadian Space Agency]] (CSA).\n\nWhen compared to terrestrial environments, the noise levels incurred by astronauts and cosmonauts on the ISS may seem insignificant and typically occur at levels that would not be of major concern to [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|the Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] \u2013 rarely reaching 85 dBA.  But crew members are exposed to these levels 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with current missions averaging 6 months in duration.  These levels of noise also impose risks to crew health and performance in the form of sleep interference and communication, as well as reduced alarm [[Hearing|audibility]].\n\nOver the 19 plus year history of the ISS, significant efforts have been put forth to limit and reduce noise levels on the ISS.  During design and pre-flight activities, members of the Acoustic Subgroup have written acoustic limits and verification requirements, consulted to design and choose quietest available payloads, and then conducted acoustic verification tests prior to launch.[https://web.archive.org/web/20200220193031/http://emits.sso.esa.int/emits-doc/ESTEC/AO6216-SoW-RD9.pdf]  During spaceflights, the Acoustics Subgroup has assessed each ISS module's in flight sound levels, produced by a large number of vehicle and science experiment noise sources, to assure compliance with strict acoustic standards.   The acoustic environment on ISS changed when additional modules were added during its construction, and as additional spacecraft arrive at the ISS.  The Acoustics Subgroup has responded to this dynamic operations schedule by successfully designing and employing acoustic covers, absorptive materials, [[noise barrier]]s, and vibration isolators to reduce noise levels. Moreover, when pumps, fans, and ventilation systems age and show increased noise levels,  this Acoustics Subgroup has guided ISS managers to replace the older, noisier instruments with quiet fan and pump technologies, significantly reducing [[ambient noise level]]s.\n\nNASA has adopted most-conservative damage risk criteria (based on recommendations from the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] and the [[World Health Organization]]), in order to protect all crew members.  The MMOP Acoustics Subgroup has adjusted its approach to managing noise risks in this unique environment by applying, or modifying, terrestrial approaches for hearing loss prevention to set these conservative limits.  One innovative approach has been NASA's Noise Exposure Estimation Tool (NEET), in which noise exposures are calculated in a task-based approach to determine the need for [[hearing protection device]]s (HPDs).  Guidance for use of HPDs, either mandatory use or recommended, is then documented in the Noise Hazard Inventory, and posted for crew reference during their missions. The Acoustics Subgroup also tracks spacecraft noise exceedances, applies [[engineering controls]], and recommends hearing protective devices to reduce crew noise exposures. Finally, hearing thresholds are monitored on-orbit, during missions .\n\nThere have been no persistent mission-related hearing threshold shifts among US Orbital Segment crewmembers (JAXA, CSA, ESA, NASA) during what is approaching 20 years of ISS mission operations, or nearly 175,000 work hours. In 2020, the MMOP Acoustics Subgroup received the [[Safe-In-Sound Award]] for Innovation for their combined efforts to mitigate any health effects of noise.[https://www.safeinsound.us/winners.html]\n\n===Fire and toxic gases===\nAn onboard fire or a toxic gas leak are other potential hazards.

The type and thickness of these panels depend on their predicted exposure to damage. The station's shields and structure have different designs on the ROS and the USOS. On the USOS, [[Whipple Shield|Whipple shields]] are used. The US segment modules consist of an inner layer made from 1.5&nbsp;cm thick aluminum, a 10&nbsp;cm thick intermediate layers of Kevlar and Nextel, and an outer layer of stainless steel, which causes objects to shatter into a cloud before hitting the hull, thereby spreading the energy of impact. On the ROS, a carbon plastic honeycomb screen is spaced from the hull, an aluminium honeycomb screen is spaced from that, with a screen-vacuum thermal insulation covering, and glass cloth over the top.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n[[File:ISS impact risk.jpg|thumb|Example of [[risk management]]: A NASA model showing areas at high risk from impact for the International Space Station.]]\n\nSpace debris is tracked remotely from the ground, and the station crew can be notified.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.orbitaldebris.jsc.nasa.gov/library/EducationPackage.pdf |title=Microsoft PowerPoint \u2013 EducationPackage SMALL.ppt |accessdate=1 May 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408183946/http://www.orbitaldebris.jsc.nasa.gov/library/EducationPackage.pdf |archivedate=8 April 2008}}</ref> If necessary, thrusters on the Russian Orbital Segment can alter the station's orbital altitude, avoiding the debris.

It provided propulsion, [[attitude control]], communications, electrical power, but lacked long-term life support functions. Two weeks later, a passive NASA module ''[[Unity (ISS module)|Unity]]'' was launched aboard Space Shuttle flight [[STS-88]] and attached to ''Zarya'' by astronauts during EVAs. This module has two [[Pressurized Mating Adapter|Pressurised Mating Adapters]] (PMAs), one connects permanently to ''Zarya'', the other allowed the Space Shuttle to dock to the space station. At that time, the Russian station ''Mir'' was still inhabited, and the ISS remained uncrewed for two years. On 12 July 2000, ''[[Zvezda (ISS module)|Zvezda]]'' was launched into orbit. Preprogrammed commands on board deployed its solar arrays and communications antenna. It then became the passive target for a rendezvous with ''Zarya'' and ''Unity'': it maintained a station-keeping orbit while the ''Zarya''-''Unity'' vehicle performed the rendezvous and docking via ground control and the Russian automated rendezvous and docking system. ''Zarya''{{'s}} computer transferred control of the station to ''Zvezda''{{'s}} computer soon after docking. ''Zvezda'' added sleeping quarters, a toilet, kitchen, CO<sub>2</sub> scrubbers, dehumidifier, oxygen generators, exercise equipment, plus data, voice and television communications with mission control.

To keep the internal temperature within workable limits, a passive thermal control system (PTCS) is made of external surface materials, insulation such as MLI, and heat pipes. If the PTCS cannot keep up with the heat load, an External Active Thermal Control System (EATCS) maintains the temperature. The EATCS consists of an internal, non-toxic, water coolant loop used to cool and dehumidify the atmosphere, which transfers collected heat into an external liquid [[ammonia]] loop. From the heat exchangers, ammonia is pumped into external radiators that emit heat as infrared radiation, then back to the station.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2001/ast21mar_1/ |title=Staying Cool on the ISS |publisher=NASA |first1=Steve |last1=Price |first2=Tony |last2=Phillips |first3=Gil |last3=Knier |date=21 March 2001 |accessdate=22 July 2016}}</ref> The EATCS provides cooling for all the US pressurised modules, including ''Kib\u014d'' and ''Columbus'', as well as the main power distribution electronics of the S0, S1 and P1 trusses.

Examples of ORUs are pumps, storage tanks, controller boxes, antennas, and battery units. Some units can be replaced using robotic arms. Most are stored outside the station, either on small pallets called [[ExPRESS Logistics Carrier]]s (ELCs) or share larger platforms called [[External Stowage Platform]]s which also hold science experiments. Both kinds of pallets provide electricity for many parts that could be damaged by the cold of space and require heating. The larger logistics carriers also have local area network (LAN) connections for telemetry to connect experiments. A heavy emphasis on stocking the USOS with ORU's occurred around 2011, before the end of the NASA shuttle programme, as its commercial replacements, [[Cygnus (spacecraft)|Cygnus]] and [[SpaceX Dragon|Dragon]], carry one tenth to one quarter the payload.\n\nUnexpected problems and failures have impacted the station's assembly time-line and work schedules leading to periods of reduced capabilities and, in some cases, could have forced abandonment of the station for safety reasons.

From an average distance of about {{convert|70,000|km|abbr=on}}, depending on Solar activity, the [[magnetosphere]] begins to deflect [[solar wind]] around Earth and ISS. [[coronal mass ejection|Solar flares]] are still a hazard to the crew, who may receive only a few minutes warning. In 2005, during the initial 'proton storm' of an X-3 class solar flare, the crew of [[Expedition 10]] took shelter in a more heavily shielded part of the [[Russian Orbital Segment|ROS]] designed for this purpose.<ref>{{cite web |title=Solar Flare Hits Earth and Mars |author=Ker Than |publisher=Space.com |date=23 February 2006 |url=http://www.space.com/2080-solar-flare-hits-earth-mars.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=A new kind of solar storm |publisher=NASA |date=10 June 2005 |url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2005/10jun_newstorm/}}</ref>\n\nSubatomic charged particles, primarily [[proton]]s from [[cosmic ray]]s and solar wind, are normally absorbed by Earth's atmosphere. When they interact in sufficient quantity, their effect is visible to the naked eye in a phenomenon called an [[aurora]]. Outside Earth's atmosphere, crews are exposed to about 1 [[millisievert]] each day, which is about a year of natural exposure on Earth, resulting in a higher risk of cancer. Radiation can penetrate living tissue and damage the [[DNA]] and [[chromosome]]s of [[lymphocytes]]. These cells are central to the [[immune system]], and so any damage to them could contribute to the lower [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] experienced by astronauts. Radiation has also been linked to a higher incidence of [[cataract]]s in astronauts. Protective shielding and drugs may lower risks to an acceptable level.<ref name=\"JCB\"/>\n\nRadiation levels on the ISS are about five times greater than those experienced by airline passengers and crew, as Earth's electromagnetic field provides almost the same level of protection against solar and other radiation in low Earth orbit as in the stratosphere. For example, on a 12-hour flight an airline passenger would experience 0.1 millisieverts of radiation, or a rate of 0.2 millisieverts per day; only 1/5 the rate experienced by an astronaut in LEO. Additionally, airline passengers experience this level of radiation for a few hours of flight, while ISS crew are exposed for their whole stay.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jag.cami.jccbi.gov./cariprofile.asp |title=Galactic Radiation Received in Flight |accessdate=20 May 2010 |publisher=FAA Civil Aeromedical Institute |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329130826/http://jag.cami.jccbi.gov/cariprofile.asp |archivedate=29 March 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Stress===\n[[File:Nikolai Budarin in a sleep station in Zvezda.jpg|thumb|Cosmonaut [[Nikolai Budarin]] at work inside ''[[Zvezda (ISS module)|Zvezda]]'' service module crew quarters]]\nThere is considerable evidence that [[psychosocial]] stressors are among the most important impediments to optimal crew morale and performance.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Peter Suedfeld1 |author2=Kasia E.

Common sources of stress in early US missions included maintaining high performance under public scrutiny and isolation from peers and family. The latter is still often a cause of stress on the ISS, such as when the mother of NASA Astronaut [[Daniel M. Tani|Daniel Tani]] died in a car accident, and when Michael Fincke was forced to miss the birth of his second child.\n\nA study of the longest spaceflight concluded that the first three weeks are a critical period where attention is adversely affected because of the demand to adjust to the extreme change of environment.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Manzey |first1=D. |last2=Lorenz |first2=B. |last3=Poljakov |first3=V. |doi=10.1080/001401398186991 |title=Mental performance in extreme environments: Results from a performance monitoring study during a 438-day spaceflight |journal=Ergonomics |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=537\u2013559 |year=1998 |pmid=9557591 |pmc=}}</ref> ISS crew flights typically last about five to six months.\n\nThe ISS working environment includes further stress caused by living and working in cramped conditions with people from very different cultures who speak a different language.

Specifically, these goals have been the primary focus of the ISS Multilateral Medical Operations Panel (MMOP) Acoustics Subgroup since the first days of ISS assembly and operations.[https://web.archive.org/web/20200220193031/http://emits.sso.esa.int/emits-doc/ESTEC/AO6216-SoW-RD9.pdf]  [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100039608.pdf] The effort includes contributions from [[Acoustical engineering|acoustical engineers]], [[Audiology|audiologists]], [[Industrial Hygienists|industrial hygienists]], and physicians who comprise the subgroup's membership from NASA, the [[Roscosmos|Russian Space Agency]] (RSA), the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA), the [[JAXA|Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency]] (JAXA), and the [[Canadian Space Agency]] (CSA).\n\nWhen compared to terrestrial environments, the noise levels incurred by astronauts and cosmonauts on the ISS may seem insignificant and typically occur at levels that would not be of major concern to [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|the Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] \u2013 rarely reaching 85 dBA.  But crew members are exposed to these levels 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with current missions averaging 6 months in duration.  These levels of noise also impose risks to crew health and performance in the form of sleep interference and communication, as well as reduced alarm [[Hearing|audibility]].\n\nOver the 19 plus year history of the ISS, significant efforts have been put forth to limit and reduce noise levels on the ISS.  During design and pre-flight activities, members of the Acoustic Subgroup have written acoustic limits and verification requirements, consulted to design and choose quietest available payloads, and then conducted acoustic verification tests prior to launch.[https://web.archive.org/web/20200220193031/http://emits.sso.esa.int/emits-doc/ESTEC/AO6216-SoW-RD9.pdf]  During spaceflights, the Acoustics Subgroup has assessed each ISS module's in flight sound levels, produced by a large number of vehicle and science experiment noise sources, to assure compliance with strict acoustic standards.   The acoustic environment on ISS changed when additional modules were added during its construction, and as additional spacecraft arrive at the ISS.  The Acoustics Subgroup has responded to this dynamic operations schedule by successfully designing and employing acoustic covers, absorptive materials, [[noise barrier]]s, and vibration isolators to reduce noise levels. Moreover, when pumps, fans, and ventilation systems age and show increased noise levels,  this Acoustics Subgroup has guided ISS managers to replace the older, noisier instruments with quiet fan and pump technologies, significantly reducing [[ambient noise level]]s.\n\nNASA has adopted most-conservative damage risk criteria (based on recommendations from the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] and the [[World Health Organization]]), in order to protect all crew members.  The MMOP Acoustics Subgroup has adjusted its approach to managing noise risks in this unique environment by applying, or modifying, terrestrial approaches for hearing loss prevention to set these conservative limits.  One innovative approach has been NASA's Noise Exposure Estimation Tool (NEET), in which noise exposures are calculated in a task-based approach to determine the need for [[hearing protection device]]s (HPDs).  Guidance for use of HPDs, either mandatory use or recommended, is then documented in the Noise Hazard Inventory, and posted for crew reference during their missions. The Acoustics Subgroup also tracks spacecraft noise exceedances, applies [[engineering controls]], and recommends hearing protective devices to reduce crew noise exposures. Finally, hearing thresholds are monitored on-orbit, during missions .\n\nThere have been no persistent mission-related hearing threshold shifts among US Orbital Segment crewmembers (JAXA, CSA, ESA, NASA) during what is approaching 20 years of ISS mission operations, or nearly 175,000 work hours. In 2020, the MMOP Acoustics Subgroup received the [[Safe-In-Sound Award]] for Innovation for their combined efforts to mitigate any health effects of noise.[https://www.safeinsound.us/winners.html]\n\n===Fire and toxic gases===\nAn onboard fire or a toxic gas leak are other potential hazards.

The type and thickness of these panels depend on their predicted exposure to damage. The station's shields and structure have different designs on the ROS and the USOS. On the USOS, [[Whipple Shield|Whipple shields]] are used. The US segment modules consist of an inner layer made from 1.5&nbsp;cm thick aluminum, a 10&nbsp;cm thick intermediate layers of Kevlar and Nextel, and an outer layer of stainless steel, which causes objects to shatter into a cloud before hitting the hull, thereby spreading the energy of impact. On the ROS, a carbon plastic honeycomb screen is spaced from the hull, an aluminium honeycomb screen is spaced from that, with a screen-vacuum thermal insulation covering, and glass cloth over the top.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n[[File:ISS impact risk.jpg|thumb|Example of [[risk management]]: A NASA model showing areas at high risk from impact for the International Space Station.]]\n\nSpace debris is tracked remotely from the ground, and the station crew can be notified.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.orbitaldebris.jsc.nasa.gov/library/EducationPackage.pdf |title=Microsoft PowerPoint \u2013 EducationPackage SMALL.ppt |accessdate=1 May 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408183946/http://www.orbitaldebris.jsc.nasa.gov/library/EducationPackage.pdf |archivedate=8 April 2008}}</ref> If necessary, thrusters on the Russian Orbital Segment can alter the station's orbital altitude, avoiding the debris.
