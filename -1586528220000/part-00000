He received a scholarship to sing in the [[a cappella]] choir at [[Transylvania University]] in [[Lexington, Kentucky]]; he attended but did not graduate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nedbeattysings.com/bio.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061117085404/http://nedbeattysings.com/bio.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2006-11-17|title=Ned Beatty Biography at|publisher=Nedbeattysings.com|date=1937-07-06|accessdate=2015-01-10}}</ref>\n\nIn 1956, he made his stage debut at age 19, appearing in ''Wilderness Road'', an outdoor-historical pageant located in [[Berea, Kentucky]]. During his first ten years of theater, he worked at the Barter Theater in Abingdon, Virginia, the State Theatre of Virginia.  Returning to Kentucky, he worked in the Louisville area through the mid-1960s, at the Clarksville Little Theater ([[Indiana]]) and the newly founded [[Actors Theater of Louisville]]. His time at the latter included a run as [[Willy Loman]] in ''[[Death of a Salesman]]'' in 1966.\n\n==Career==\n\n===1970s===\n[[File:Szysznyk cast 1977.JPG|thumb|right|Ned Beatty with Susan Lanier and Olivia Cole from the short-lived television program ''[[Szysznyk]]'' in 1977.]]\nIn 1972, Beatty made his film debut as Bobby Trippe in ''[[Deliverance]]'' (1972), starring [[Jon Voight]] and [[Burt Reynolds]], and set in northern Georgia. Beatty's character is forced to strip at gunpoint by two mountain men who humiliate and rape him, a scene so shocking that it is still referenced as a screen milestone.<ref>[http://www.movie-list.com/forum/showthread.php?13254-The-25-Most-Shocking-Moments-in-Movie-History-%28spoilers%29 The 25 Most Shocking Moments in Movie History], movie-list.com; accessed April 25, 2015.</ref> In 1972, he also appeared in ''[[The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean]]'', a western with [[Paul Newman]].   \n\nIn 1973, Beatty made ''[[The Thief Who Came to Dinner]]'', ''[[The Last American Hero]]'' and ''[[White Lightning (1973 film)|White Lightning]]''. The latter film reunited Beatty with his ''[[Deliverance]]'' co-star [[Burt Reynolds]]. He also appeared in an episode of the TV series ''[[The Waltons]]'' that year, as well as the TV movie ''[[The Marcus-Nelson Murders]]'', the pilot for the series ''[[Kojak]]''.

In 1975, he made ''[[W.W. and the Dixie Dancekings]]'' and ''[[Nashville (film)|Nashville]]'', as well as appearing as Colonel Hollister in the 1975 ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'' episode, \"Dear Peggy\". He appeared in the NBC-TV movie ''[[Attack on Terror: The FBI vs. the Ku Klux Klan]]'' as Deputy Sheriff Ollie Thompson (1975). Ned also made an appearance on ''[[Gunsmoke]]'' in \"The Hiders\" episode in 1975.\n\nBeatty received his first [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] category for the acclaimed film ''[[Network (1976 film)|Network]]'' (1976), portraying a television network's bombastic but shrewd chairman of the board who convinces the mad Howard Beale character (portrayed by [[Peter Finch]]) that corporation-led global dehumanization is not only inevitable, but is also a good thing. Neither Beatty nor [[William Holden]], who shared the lead role with Finch, won an Oscar. The other three acting awards besides best supporting actor were swept by ''Network'' performers: [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for [[Peter Finch]], [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for [[Faye Dunaway]], and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for [[Beatrice Straight]].\n\nIn 1976, he appeared in ''[[All the President's Men (film)|All the President's Men]]'', ''[[The Big Bus]]'', ''[[Silver Streak (1976 film)|Silver Streak]]'' and ''[[Mikey and Nicky]]''.

He played a corrupt cop in the 1987 American neo-noir crime film ''[[The Big Easy (1987 film)|The Big Easy]]'', directed by [[Jim McBride]] and starring [[Dennis Quaid]], and continued with a spy drama, ''[[The Fourth Protocol (film)|The Fourth Protocol]]'' (1987), opposite [[Michael Caine]] and [[Pierce Brosnan]].\n\nIn 1988, Beatty appeared with the main character Thelonious Pitt in ''[[Shadows in the Storm]]'', reunited with [[Burt Reynolds]] and [[Christopher Reeve]] for the 1988 comedy film ''[[Switching Channels]]'', his fifth time in a movie with Reynolds.
