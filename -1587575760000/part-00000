The treaty was a reaction of the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] provinces to the 1579 [[Union of Arras]] (Dutch: ''Unie van Atrecht''), in which the southern provinces declared their support for [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] Spain.\n\nDuring the following months of 1579, other states signed the treaty as well, such as [[Ghent]], cities from [[Friesland]], as well as three of the quarters of [[Guelders]] ([[Nijmegen Quarter]], [[Veluwe Quarter]], [[Zutphen County]]). In the summer of 1579, [[Amersfoort]] from the province of Utrecht also joined, together with [[Ypres]], [[Antwerp]], [[Breda (Netherlands)|Breda]] and [[Brussels]]. In February 1580, [[Lier, Belgium|Lier]], [[Bruges]] and the surrounding area also signed the Union. The city of [[Groningen (city)|Groningen]] shifted in favor under influence of the [[stadtholder]] for Friesland, [[George van Rennenberg]], and also signed the treaty. The fourth quarter of Guelders, [[Upper Guelders]], never signed the treaty. In April 1580, [[Overijssel]] and [[Drenthe]] signed on.\n\n[[Image:Map Union of Arras and Utrecht 1579-en.svg|right|thumb|Map of the Spanish Netherlands, the Union of Utrecht and the Union of Arras (1579)]]\nThis leads to a general and simplified overview of the parts that joined:\n* the [[County of Holland]]\n* the [[County of Zeeland]]\n* the [[Lordship of Utrecht]]\n* the [[Duchy of Guelders]]\n* the [[Lordship of Groningen]]\n* the [[Lordship of Friesland]]\n* the [[County of Drenthe]]\n* the [[Lordship of Overijssel]]\n* the [[Duchy of Brabant]]\n* the [[County of Flanders]]\n* the cities of [[Tournai]] and [[Valenciennes]]\n\nAntwerp was the capital of the union until [[Fall of Antwerp|its fall to the Spanish]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nFlanders was almost entirely conquered by the Spanish troops, as was half of Brabant.

The F-117 was based on the ''[[Lockheed Have Blue|Have Blue]]'' technology demonstrator.\n\nThe Nighthawk was the first operational aircraft to be designed around [[stealth technology]]. Its [[maiden flight]] took place in 1981 at [[Groom Lake, Nevada]], and the aircraft achieved [[initial operating capability]] status in 1983. The Nighthawk was shrouded in secrecy until it was revealed to the public in 1988. Of the 64 F-117s built, 59 were production versions, with the other five being prototypes.\n\nThe F-117 was widely publicized for its role in the Persian [[Gulf War]] of 1991. Although it was commonly referred to as the \"Stealth Fighter\", it was strictly a ground-attack aircraft. F-117s took part in the conflict in [[Yugoslav Wars|Yugoslavia]], where [[1999 F-117A shootdown|one was shot down]] by a [[surface-to-air missile]] (SAM) in 1999; it was the only Nighthawk to be lost in combat. The U.S. Air Force retired the F-117 in April 2008, primarily due to the fielding of the [[Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor|F-22 Raptor]]. Despite the type's retirement, a portion of the fleet has been kept in airworthy condition, and Nighthawks have been observed flying as recently as March 2020.<ref name=CA_2019-07-14/><ref name=PM_2020_03-19/>\n\n== Development ==\n\n=== Background and ''Have Blue'' ===\n{{main|Lockheed Have Blue}}\n\nIn 1964, [[Pyotr Ufimtsev]], a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] mathematician, published a seminal paper titled ''Method of Edge Waves in the Physical Theory of Diffraction'' in the journal of the Moscow Institute for Radio Engineering, in which he showed that the strength of the [[radar]] return from an object is related to its edge configuration, not its size.<ref name=\"dtic\" /> Ufimtsev was extending theoretical work published by the German physicist [[Arnold Sommerfeld]].<ref name=\"Centennial\" /><ref name=\"diffraction\" /><ref name=\"filling\" /> Ufimtsev demonstrated that he could calculate the [[radar cross-section]] across a wing's surface and along its edge. The obvious and logical conclusion was that even a large aircraft could reduce its radar signature by exploiting this principle. However, the resulting design would make the aircraft [[Relaxed stability|aerodynamically unstable]], and the state of computer technology in the early 1960s could not provide the kinds of flight computers which would later allow aircraft such as the F-117 and [[Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit|B-2 Spirit]] to stay airborne. By the 1970s, when Lockheed analyst Denys Overholser found Ufimtsev's paper, computers and software had advanced significantly, and the stage was set for the development of a stealth airplane.<ref name=\"Advent\" />\n\n[[File:F-117 Grey Dragon.jpg|thumb|F-117A painted in \"Gray Dragon\" experimental camouflage scheme|alt=Aircraft parked inside an open hangar]]\nThe F-117 was born after combat experience in the [[Vietnam War]] when increasingly sophisticated [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[surface-to-air missile]]s (SAMs) downed heavy bombers.<ref name=\"air-attack\" /> It was a [[black project]], an ultra-secret program for much of its life: very few people in [[the Pentagon]] knew the program even existed, until the F-117s were revealed to the public in 1988.<ref name=\"maxwell\" /><ref name=\"bbc\" /> The project began in 1975 with a model called the \"Hopeless Diamond\"<ref name=\"rich\" /><ref name=\"f117reunion\" /> (a wordplay on the [[Hope Diamond]] because of its appearance).

Armed guards prohibited entry, including firefighters, and a [[helicopter gunship]] circled the site. All F-117 debris was replaced with remains of a [[F-101A Voodoo]] crash stored at Area 51. When another fatal crash in October 1987 occurred inside Nellis, the military again provided little information to the press.{{r|afmag-richelson}}\n\nThe Air Force denied the existence of the aircraft until 10 November 1988, when Assistant Secretary of Defense [[J.

The F-117 is primarily an attack aircraft,<ref name=eden_p240>{{harvnb|Eden|2004|p=240.}}</ref> so its \"F\" designation is inconsistent with the [[United States Department of Defense|DoD]] system. This is an inconsistency that has been repeatedly employed by the [[U.S. Air Force]] with several of its attack aircraft since the late 1950s, including the [[Republic F-105 Thunderchief]] and [[General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark]]. A televised documentary quoted project manager Alan Brown as saying that [[Robert J. Dixon]], a four-star Air Force general who was the head of [[Tactical Air Command]] felt that the top-notch USAF fighter pilots required to fly the new aircraft were more easily attracted to an aircraft with an \"F\" designation for fighter, as opposed to a bomber (\"B\") or attack (\"A\") designation.<ref name=\"history\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81S4W8rOCgo&t=1658s|title=Modern Marvels S11E62 F117|first=|last=Moderns|date=13 April 2017|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nThe designation \"F-117\" seems to indicate that it was given an official designation prior to the 1962 U.S. Tri-Service Aircraft Designation System and could be considered numerically to be a part of the earlier \"Century series\" of fighters. The assumption prior to the revealing of the aircraft to the public was that it would likely receive the [[F-19]] designation as that number had not been used. However, there were no other aircraft to receive a \"100\" series number following the F-111. Soviet fighters obtained by the U.S. via various means under the [[Constant Peg]] program<ref name=\"airforce-magazine\" /> were given F-series numbers for their evaluation by U.S. pilots, and with the advent of the [[Teen Series]] fighters, most often [[Century Series]] designations.<ref name=\"Merlin_groom_2011_p32\">{{cite book |title=Images of Aviation: Area 51 |publisher=Arcadia Publishing |author=Peter W.

This same radio call had been used by the enigmatic [[4477th Test and Evaluation Squadron]], also known as the \"Red Hats\" or \"Red Eagles\", that often had flown expatriated [[Mikoyan#List of MiG aircraft|MiG jet fighters]] in the area, but there was no relationship to the call and the formal F-19 designation then being considered by the Air Force.

He believed smoothly blended shapes offered the best combination of speed and stealth. However, his assistant, Ben Rich, showed that faceted-angle surfaces would provide significant reduction in radar signature, and the necessary aerodynamic control could be provided with computer units. A May 1975 Skunk Works report, \"Progress Report No. 2, High Stealth Conceptual Studies\", showed the rounded concept that was rejected in favor of the flat-sided approach.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airspacemag.com/military-aviation/secrets-skunk-works-180952122/?page=6%5D|title=Secrets of the Skunk Works \u2013 'Little Harvey, Concept B'|first=Chad|last=Slattery|publisher=[[Air & Space/Smithsonian]]}}</ref>\n\nThe resulting unusual design surprised and puzzled experienced pilots; a [[Royal Air Force]] pilot, who flew it as an [[exchange officer]] while it was still a secret project, stated that when he first saw a photograph of the F-117, he \"promptly giggled and thought to [himself] 'this clearly can't fly{{'\"}}.<ref name=\"crickmore\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IOshjF1z5dgC&lpg=PT69&pg=PT69#v=onepage&f=false|title=Nighthawk F-117 Stealth Fighter|publisher=Zenith Imprint|author=Crickmore, Paul and Alison J.|origyear=1999|year=2003|pages=85\u201386|isbn=978-1-61060-737-7}}</ref> Early stealth aircraft were designed with a focus on minimal [[radar cross-section]] (RCS) rather than aerodynamic performance.

To lower development costs, the avionics, fly-by-wire systems, and other parts were derived from the [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon]], [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet]] and [[McDonnell Douglas F-15E Strike Eagle]]. The parts were originally described as spares on budgets for these aircraft, to keep the F-117 project secret.\n\n[[File:Lockheed F-117A cockpit at the National Museum of the United States Air Force, Dayton, Ohio, USA.jpg|thumb|Cockpit]]\nThe aircraft is equipped with sophisticated navigation and attack systems integrated into a digital avionics suite. It navigates primarily by [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] and high-accuracy [[inertial navigation]]. Missions are coordinated by an automated planning system that can automatically perform all aspects of an attack mission, including weapons release. Targets are acquired by a [[thermal imaging]] [[infrared]] system, slaved to a [[laser rangefinder]]/[[laser designator]] that finds the range and designates targets for [[laser-guided bomb]]s. The F-117A's split internal bay can carry {{convert|5000|lb}} of ordnance. Typical weapons are a pair of [[GBU-10]], [[GBU-12]], or [[GBU-27]] laser-guided bombs, two [[BLU-109]] penetration bombs, or two Joint Direct Attack Munitions ([[JDAM]]s), a GPS/INS guided stand-off bomb.\n\n=== Stealth ===\n{{main|Stealth aircraft}}\n\nThe F-117 has a [[radar cross-section]] of about {{Convert|0.001|m2|sigfig=3|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"richardson\" /> Among the penalties for stealth are lower engine thrust due to losses in the inlet and outlet, a very low wing [[Aspect ratio (wing)|aspect ratio]], and a high [[sweep angle]] (50\u00b0) needed to deflect incoming radar waves to the sides.<ref name=\"Sweetman AS dj2008\" /> With these design considerations and no [[afterburner]], the F-117 is limited to subsonic speeds.\n\nThe F-117A carries no radar, which lowers emissions and cross-section, and whether it carries any radar detection equipment is classified.<ref name=\"Sweetman AS dj2008\" />\n\nThe F-117A's [[faceting|faceted]] shape (made from 2-dimensional flat surfaces) resulted from the limitations of the 1970s-era computer technology used to calculate its radar cross-section. Later [[supercomputer]]s made it possible for subsequent aircraft like the [[B-2 bomber]] to use curved surfaces while maintaining stealth, through the use of far more computational resources to perform the additional calculations.<ref name=\"rich4\" />\n\nAn exhaust plume contributes a significant [[infrared signature]]. The F-117 reduces IR signature with a non-circular [[exhaust system|tail pipe]] (a slit shape) to minimize the exhaust cross-sectional volume and maximize the mixing of hot exhaust with cool ambient air. The F-117 lacks [[afterburner]]s, because the hot exhaust would increase the infrared signature, and breaking the [[sound barrier]] would produce an obvious [[sonic boom]], as well as surface heating of the aircraft skin which also increases the infrared footprint. As a result, its performance in [[air combat maneuvering]] required in a [[dogfight]] would never match that of a dedicated fighter aircraft. This was unimportant in the case of this aircraft since it was designed to be a bomber.\n\n[[Passive radar|Passive (multistatic) radar]], [[bistatic radar]]<ref name=\"Bistatic Radar Sets\">{{cite web|url=http://www.radartutorial.eu/05.bistatic/bs04.en.html|title=Bistatic Radar Sets|publisher=Radartutorial.eu|accessdate=16 December 2010}}</ref> and especially [[multistatic radar]] systems detect some stealth aircraft better than conventional [[monostatic radar]]s, since first-generation stealth technology (such as the F-117) reflects energy away from the transmitter's [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]], effectively increasing the [[radar cross section]] (RCS) in other directions, which the passive radars monitor.\n\n== Operational history ==\n[[File:F-117A GBU-28.JPEG|thumb|An F-117 conducts a live exercise bombing run using [[GBU-27 Paveway III|GBU-27]] laser-guided bombs]]\n\nDuring the program's early years, from 1984 to mid-1992, the F-117A fleet was based at [[Tonopah Test Range Airport]], [[Nevada]], where it served under the 4450th Tactical Group. Because the F-117 was classified during this time, the unit was officially located at [[Nellis Air Force Base]], Nevada, and equipped with [[A-7 Corsair II]] aircraft. All military personnel were permanently assigned to Nellis AFB, and most personnel and their families lived in Las Vegas. This required commercial air and trucking to transport personnel between Las Vegas and Tonopah each week. The 4450th was absorbed by the [[37th Fighter Wing|37th Tactical Fighter Wing]] in 1989. In 1992, the entire fleet was transferred to [[Holloman Air Force Base]], [[New Mexico]], under the command of the [[49th Fighter Wing]]. This move also eliminated the [[Key Air]] and [[American Trans Air]] contract flights to Tonopah, which flew 22,000 passenger trips on 300 flights from Nellis to Tonopah per month.\n\nThe F-117 reached [[initial operating capability]] status in 1983.<ref name=\"Nat_Museum_factsht\" /> The Nighthawk's pilots called themselves \"Bandits\". Each of the 558 Air Force pilots who have flown the F-117 has a Bandit number, such as \"Bandit 52\", that indicates the sequential order of their first flight in the F-117.<ref name=\"Topolsky\" /> Pilots told friends and families that they flew the [[Northrop F-5]] in [[aggressor squadron]]s against Tactical Air Command.<ref name=\"afmag-richelson\">{{cite magazine|author=Jeffrey T.

The F-117 was based on the ''[[Lockheed Have Blue|Have Blue]]'' technology demonstrator.\n\nThe Nighthawk was the first operational aircraft to be designed around [[stealth technology]]. Its [[maiden flight]] took place in 1981 at [[Groom Lake, Nevada]], and the aircraft achieved [[initial operating capability]] status in 1983. The Nighthawk was shrouded in secrecy until it was revealed to the public in 1988. Of the 64 F-117s built, 59 were production versions, with the other five being prototypes.\n\nThe F-117 was widely publicized for its role in the Persian [[Gulf War]] of 1991. Although it was commonly referred to as the \"Stealth Fighter\", it was strictly a ground-attack aircraft.

The obvious and logical conclusion was that even a large aircraft could reduce its radar signature by exploiting this principle. However, the resulting design would make the aircraft [[Relaxed stability|aerodynamically unstable]], and the state of computer technology in the early 1960s could not provide the kinds of flight computers which would later allow aircraft such as the F-117 and [[Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit|B-2 Spirit]] to stay airborne. By the 1970s, when Lockheed analyst Denys Overholser found Ufimtsev's paper, computers and software had advanced significantly, and the stage was set for the development of a stealth airplane.<ref name=\"Advent\" />\n\n[[File:F-117 Grey Dragon.jpg|thumb|F-117A painted in \"Gray Dragon\" experimental camouflage scheme|alt=Aircraft parked inside an open hangar]]\nThe F-117 was born after combat experience in the [[Vietnam War]] when increasingly sophisticated [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[surface-to-air missile]]s (SAMs) downed heavy bombers.<ref name=\"air-attack\" /> It was a [[black project]], an ultra-secret program for much of its life: very few people in [[the Pentagon]] knew the program even existed, until the F-117s were revealed to the public in 1988.<ref name=\"maxwell\" /><ref name=\"bbc\" /> The project began in 1975 with a model called the \"Hopeless Diamond\"<ref name=\"rich\" /><ref name=\"f117reunion\" /> (a wordplay on the [[Hope Diamond]] because of its appearance). The following year, the [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA) issued Lockheed Skunk Works a contract to build and test two Stealth Strike Fighters, under the code name \"''[[Lockheed Have Blue|Have Blue]]''\".<ref name=\"Goodall p.19\" /> These subscale aircraft incorporated jet engines of the [[Northrop T-38 Talon|Northrop T-38A]], [[fly-by-wire]] systems of the [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16]], landing gear of the [[Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II|A-10]], and [[Built environment|environmental systems]] of the [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|C-130]].<ref name=\"Goodall p.19\" /> By bringing together existing technology and components, Lockheed built two demonstrators under budget, at $35&nbsp;million for both aircraft, and in record time.<ref name=\"Goodall p.19\" />\n\nThe [[maiden flight]] of the demonstrators occurred on 1&nbsp;December 1977.<ref name=\"eden\" /> Although both aircraft were lost during the demonstration program, test data proved positive.

Many news articles discussed what they called a \"[[F-19]]\" stealth fighter, and the [[Testor Corporation]] produced a very inaccurate [[scale model]]. When a F-117 crashed in [[Sequoia National Forest]] in July 1986, killing the pilot and starting a fire, the Air Force established [[restricted airspace]]. Armed guards prohibited entry, including firefighters, and a [[helicopter gunship]] circled the site. All F-117 debris was replaced with remains of a [[F-101A Voodoo]] crash stored at Area 51. When another fatal crash in October 1987 occurred inside Nellis, the military again provided little information to the press.{{r|afmag-richelson}}\n\nThe Air Force denied the existence of the aircraft until 10 November 1988, when Assistant Secretary of Defense [[J.

The F-117 is primarily an attack aircraft,<ref name=eden_p240>{{harvnb|Eden|2004|p=240.}}</ref> so its \"F\" designation is inconsistent with the [[United States Department of Defense|DoD]] system. This is an inconsistency that has been repeatedly employed by the [[U.S. Air Force]] with several of its attack aircraft since the late 1950s, including the [[Republic F-105 Thunderchief]] and [[General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark]]. A televised documentary quoted project manager Alan Brown as saying that [[Robert J. Dixon]], a four-star Air Force general who was the head of [[Tactical Air Command]] felt that the top-notch USAF fighter pilots required to fly the new aircraft were more easily attracted to an aircraft with an \"F\" designation for fighter, as opposed to a bomber (\"B\") or attack (\"A\") designation.<ref name=\"history\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81S4W8rOCgo&t=1658s|title=Modern Marvels S11E62 F117|first=|last=Moderns|date=13 April 2017|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nThe designation \"F-117\" seems to indicate that it was given an official designation prior to the 1962 U.S. Tri-Service Aircraft Designation System and could be considered numerically to be a part of the earlier \"Century series\" of fighters. The assumption prior to the revealing of the aircraft to the public was that it would likely receive the [[F-19]] designation as that number had not been used. However, there were no other aircraft to receive a \"100\" series number following the F-111. Soviet fighters obtained by the U.S. via various means under the [[Constant Peg]] program<ref name=\"airforce-magazine\" /> were given F-series numbers for their evaluation by U.S. pilots, and with the advent of the [[Teen Series]] fighters, most often [[Century Series]] designations.<ref name=\"Merlin_groom_2011_p32\">{{cite book |title=Images of Aviation: Area 51 |publisher=Arcadia Publishing |author=Peter W.

This same radio call had been used by the enigmatic [[4477th Test and Evaluation Squadron]], also known as the \"Red Hats\" or \"Red Eagles\", that often had flown expatriated [[Mikoyan#List of MiG aircraft|MiG jet fighters]] in the area, but there was no relationship to the call and the formal F-19 designation then being considered by the Air Force. Apparently, use of the \"117\" radio call became commonplace and when Lockheed released its first flight manual (i.e., the Air Force \"dash one\" manual for the aircraft), F-117A was the designation printed on the cover.<ref name=\"miller\" />\n\n== Design ==\n[[File:F-117 Front View.jpg|thumb|Front view of an F-117|alt=Closeup view of the nose of a black jet, emphasizing the many angled-surfaces]]\n\nWhen the Air Force first approached Lockheed with the stealth concept, Skunk Works Director Kelly Johnson proposed a rounded design. He believed smoothly blended shapes offered the best combination of speed and stealth. However, his assistant, Ben Rich, showed that faceted-angle surfaces would provide significant reduction in radar signature, and the necessary aerodynamic control could be provided with computer units. A May 1975 Skunk Works report, \"Progress Report No. 2, High Stealth Conceptual Studies\", showed the rounded concept that was rejected in favor of the flat-sided approach.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airspacemag.com/military-aviation/secrets-skunk-works-180952122/?page=6%5D|title=Secrets of the Skunk Works \u2013 'Little Harvey, Concept B'|first=Chad|last=Slattery|publisher=[[Air & Space/Smithsonian]]}}</ref>\n\nThe resulting unusual design surprised and puzzled experienced pilots; a [[Royal Air Force]] pilot, who flew it as an [[exchange officer]] while it was still a secret project, stated that when he first saw a photograph of the F-117, he \"promptly giggled and thought to [himself] 'this clearly can't fly{{'\"}}.<ref name=\"crickmore\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IOshjF1z5dgC&lpg=PT69&pg=PT69#v=onepage&f=false|title=Nighthawk F-117 Stealth Fighter|publisher=Zenith Imprint|author=Crickmore, Paul and Alison J.|origyear=1999|year=2003|pages=85\u201386|isbn=978-1-61060-737-7}}</ref> Early stealth aircraft were designed with a focus on minimal [[radar cross-section]] (RCS) rather than aerodynamic performance.

To lower development costs, the avionics, fly-by-wire systems, and other parts were derived from the [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon]], [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet]] and [[McDonnell Douglas F-15E Strike Eagle]]. The parts were originally described as spares on budgets for these aircraft, to keep the F-117 project secret.\n\n[[File:Lockheed F-117A cockpit at the National Museum of the United States Air Force, Dayton, Ohio, USA.jpg|thumb|Cockpit]]\nThe aircraft is equipped with sophisticated navigation and attack systems integrated into a digital avionics suite. It navigates primarily by [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] and high-accuracy [[inertial navigation]]. Missions are coordinated by an automated planning system that can automatically perform all aspects of an attack mission, including weapons release. Targets are acquired by a [[thermal imaging]] [[infrared]] system, slaved to a [[laser rangefinder]]/[[laser designator]] that finds the range and designates targets for [[laser-guided bomb]]s. The F-117A's split internal bay can carry {{convert|5000|lb}} of ordnance. Typical weapons are a pair of [[GBU-10]], [[GBU-12]], or [[GBU-27]] laser-guided bombs, two [[BLU-109]] penetration bombs, or two Joint Direct Attack Munitions ([[JDAM]]s), a GPS/INS guided stand-off bomb.\n\n=== Stealth ===\n{{main|Stealth aircraft}}\n\nThe F-117 has a [[radar cross-section]] of about {{Convert|0.001|m2|sigfig=3|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"richardson\" /> Among the penalties for stealth are lower engine thrust due to losses in the inlet and outlet, a very low wing [[Aspect ratio (wing)|aspect ratio]], and a high [[sweep angle]] (50\u00b0) needed to deflect incoming radar waves to the sides.<ref name=\"Sweetman AS dj2008\" /> With these design considerations and no [[afterburner]], the F-117 is limited to subsonic speeds.\n\nThe F-117A carries no radar, which lowers emissions and cross-section, and whether it carries any radar detection equipment is classified.<ref name=\"Sweetman AS dj2008\" />\n\nThe F-117A's [[faceting|faceted]] shape (made from 2-dimensional flat surfaces) resulted from the limitations of the 1970s-era computer technology used to calculate its radar cross-section. Later [[supercomputer]]s made it possible for subsequent aircraft like the [[B-2 bomber]] to use curved surfaces while maintaining stealth, through the use of far more computational resources to perform the additional calculations.<ref name=\"rich4\" />\n\nAn exhaust plume contributes a significant [[infrared signature]]. The F-117 reduces IR signature with a non-circular [[exhaust system|tail pipe]] (a slit shape) to minimize the exhaust cross-sectional volume and maximize the mixing of hot exhaust with cool ambient air. The F-117 lacks [[afterburner]]s, because the hot exhaust would increase the infrared signature, and breaking the [[sound barrier]] would produce an obvious [[sonic boom]], as well as surface heating of the aircraft skin which also increases the infrared footprint. As a result, its performance in [[air combat maneuvering]] required in a [[dogfight]] would never match that of a dedicated fighter aircraft. This was unimportant in the case of this aircraft since it was designed to be a bomber.\n\n[[Passive radar|Passive (multistatic) radar]], [[bistatic radar]]<ref name=\"Bistatic Radar Sets\">{{cite web|url=http://www.radartutorial.eu/05.bistatic/bs04.en.html|title=Bistatic Radar Sets|publisher=Radartutorial.eu|accessdate=16 December 2010}}</ref> and especially [[multistatic radar]] systems detect some stealth aircraft better than conventional [[monostatic radar]]s, since first-generation stealth technology (such as the F-117) reflects energy away from the transmitter's [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]], effectively increasing the [[radar cross section]] (RCS) in other directions, which the passive radars monitor.\n\n== Operational history ==\n[[File:F-117A GBU-28.JPEG|thumb|An F-117 conducts a live exercise bombing run using [[GBU-27 Paveway III|GBU-27]] laser-guided bombs]]\n\nDuring the program's early years, from 1984 to mid-1992, the F-117A fleet was based at [[Tonopah Test Range Airport]], [[Nevada]], where it served under the 4450th Tactical Group. Because the F-117 was classified during this time, the unit was officially located at [[Nellis Air Force Base]], Nevada, and equipped with [[A-7 Corsair II]] aircraft. All military personnel were permanently assigned to Nellis AFB, and most personnel and their families lived in Las Vegas. This required commercial air and trucking to transport personnel between Las Vegas and Tonopah each week. The 4450th was absorbed by the [[37th Fighter Wing|37th Tactical Fighter Wing]] in 1989. In 1992, the entire fleet was transferred to [[Holloman Air Force Base]], [[New Mexico]], under the command of the [[49th Fighter Wing]]. This move also eliminated the [[Key Air]] and [[American Trans Air]] contract flights to Tonopah, which flew 22,000 passenger trips on 300 flights from Nellis to Tonopah per month.\n\nThe F-117 reached [[initial operating capability]] status in 1983.<ref name=\"Nat_Museum_factsht\" /> The Nighthawk's pilots called themselves \"Bandits\". Each of the 558 Air Force pilots who have flown the F-117 has a Bandit number, such as \"Bandit 52\", that indicates the sequential order of their first flight in the F-117.<ref name=\"Topolsky\" /> Pilots told friends and families that they flew the [[Northrop F-5]] in [[aggressor squadron]]s against Tactical Air Command.<ref name=\"afmag-richelson\">{{cite magazine|author=Jeffrey T.

He played three seasons of [[college basketball]] for [[Bellarmine University]], becoming the only player in school history to be named to the NABC All-America Team two years in a row. He was also a key member of the [[Bellarmine Knights]]' 2011 championship-winning team, helping the school claim their first NCAA Division II National Championship.\n\nKendle moved to Australia in 2015 and saw immediate success, claiming the [[Queensland Basketball League|QBL]] Most Valuable Player award as a member of the Toowoomba Mountaineers. The following year, he joined the [[Bendigo Braves]] and helped them win the [[South East Australian Basketball League|SEABL]] championship. He was also named league MVP and Grand Final MVP. His impressive season with Bendigo earned him a spot on the [[Brisbane Bullets]] roster late in the [[2016\u201317 NBL season]]. He went on to play in New Zealand with the [[Canterbury Rams]] in 2017 before having a short stint with the [[Sydney Kings]]. He then had return stints with the Braves and the Bullets.\n\nIn November 2019, Kendle was named head coach of the South West Metro Pirates.\n\n==Early life==\nKendle was born and raised in [[Jeffersonville, Indiana]], and grew up playing basketball. As a sophomore at [[Jeffersonville High School]], Kendle was nearly cut from the basketball team due to his small stature; he was five-foot seven inches tall and 140 pounds. He was told he wasn't good enough to make the varsity basketball team. The head coach on the senior varsity team wanted to cut him, but the junior varsity coach knew his father and they had a mutual respect. He kept Kendle on the team, but he rode the bench for the whole season. The next year, he hit a six-inch growth spurt and worked really hard physically. He subsequently started on the varsity team as a junior.<ref name=faith>{{cite web | last=Bourke | first=Adam | url=http://www.bendigoadvertiser.com.au/story/3920370/bendigo-braves-star-jeremy-kendle-keeps-the-faith/ | title=Bendigo Braves star Jeremy Kendle keeps the faith | work=BendigoAdvertiser.com.au | date=May 20, 2016 | accessdate=June 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAs a senior in 2005\u201306 playing for coach Jimmy Just, Kendle averaged 15.1 points and 4.4 rebounds per game. He helped lead the Red Devils to a 23\u20132 record and the Hoosier Hills Conference Championship, and subsequently earned first team All-District, All-Region and All-Area selection.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://athletics.bellarmine.edu/roster.aspx?rp_id=1727 | title=Jeremy Kendle - 2011-12 Men's Basketball | work=Bellarmine.edu | accessdate=December 27, 2015}}</ref>\n\nDuring his high school years, Kendle's mother battled [[ovarian cancer]]. Kendle has said of those tough times, \"It all happened for a reason. It made my character stronger. Having that perseverance in you is a key to life in my opinion.\"<ref name=\"faith\" />\n\n==College career==\n\n===Injury troubles and second chance===\nAs a freshman in 2006\u201307, Kendle attended [[Olney Central College|Olney Central Community College]] but managed just two games for the Blue Knights after sustaining a severe foot injury that required surgery. He returned home to Jeffersonville for the 2007\u201308 season and fully recovered. After his left foot healed, he re-joined the Blue Knights for the 2008\u201309 season,<ref>{{cite web | last=Hatten | first=Justin | url=http://www.olneydailymail.com/article/20081030/NEWS/310309955 | title=OCC hosts Sound Doctrine Saturday in season opener | work=OlneyDailyMail.com | date=October 30, 2008 | accessdate=December 27, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last=Martinez | first=Marcia | url=http://www.sj-r.com/article/20100308/NEWS/303089900 | title=Kendle carves up KWU to give Bellarmine GLVC title | work=SJ-R.com | date=March 8, 2010 | accessdate=December 27, 2015}}</ref> but on the first day of practice, he broke his right foot. After three months out, he came back and broke his right foot again in two different places. While a less driven athlete would have pulled the pin on his basketball career, Kendle had other ideas. He subsequently changed his diet and went through a vigorous therapy program.<ref name=\"faith\" />\n\nHis comeback in 2009 saw him earn a try-out with [[Bellarmine University]], despite his commitment to being a walk-on at the [[University of Southern Indiana]], a rival school of Bellarmine. He played well in the trial at Bellarmine, and a few days later, he was given a full scholarship.<ref name=\"faith\" /> Bellarmine was only a 20-minute drive from his family home which allowed him to spend time with his ill mother and gave his family the chance to watch him play regularly.<ref name=\"faith\" />\n\n===Bellarmine University===\n\n====2009\u201310 season====\nKendle began playing for the [[Bellarmine Knights]] during the 2009\u201310 season.

Kendle''' (born March 15, 1988) is an American professional [[basketball]] player who is currently player/coach of the South West Metro Pirates of the [[NBL1 North]]. He played three seasons of [[college basketball]] for [[Bellarmine University]], becoming the only player in school history to be named to the NABC All-America Team two years in a row. He was also a key member of the [[Bellarmine Knights]]' 2011 championship-winning team, helping the school claim their first NCAA Division II National Championship.\n\nKendle moved to Australia in 2015 and saw immediate success, claiming the [[Queensland Basketball League|QBL]] Most Valuable Player award as a member of the Toowoomba Mountaineers. The following year, he joined the [[Bendigo Braves]] and helped them win the [[South East Australian Basketball League|SEABL]] championship. He was also named league MVP and Grand Final MVP. His impressive season with Bendigo earned him a spot on the [[Brisbane Bullets]] roster late in the [[2016\u201317 NBL season]]. He went on to play in New Zealand with the [[Canterbury Rams]] in 2017 before having a short stint with the [[Sydney Kings]]. He then had return stints with the Braves and the Bullets.\n\nIn November 2019, Kendle was named head coach of the South West Metro Pirates.\n\n==Early life==\nKendle was born and raised in [[Jeffersonville, Indiana]], and grew up playing basketball. As a sophomore at [[Jeffersonville High School]], Kendle was nearly cut from the basketball team due to his small stature; he was five-foot seven inches tall and 140 pounds. He was told he wasn't good enough to make the varsity basketball team. The head coach on the senior varsity team wanted to cut him, but the junior varsity coach knew his father and they had a mutual respect. He kept Kendle on the team, but he rode the bench for the whole season. The next year, he hit a six-inch growth spurt and worked really hard physically. He subsequently started on the varsity team as a junior.<ref name=faith>{{cite web | last=Bourke | first=Adam | url=http://www.bendigoadvertiser.com.au/story/3920370/bendigo-braves-star-jeremy-kendle-keeps-the-faith/ | title=Bendigo Braves star Jeremy Kendle keeps the faith | work=BendigoAdvertiser.com.au | date=May 20, 2016 | accessdate=June 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAs a senior in 2005\u201306 playing for coach Jimmy Just, Kendle averaged 15.1 points and 4.4 rebounds per game. He helped lead the Red Devils to a 23\u20132 record and the Hoosier Hills Conference Championship, and subsequently earned first team All-District, All-Region and All-Area selection.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://athletics.bellarmine.edu/roster.aspx?rp_id=1727 | title=Jeremy Kendle - 2011-12 Men's Basketball | work=Bellarmine.edu | accessdate=December 27, 2015}}</ref>\n\nDuring his high school years, Kendle's mother battled [[ovarian cancer]]. Kendle has said of those tough times, \"It all happened for a reason. It made my character stronger. Having that perseverance in you is a key to life in my opinion.\"<ref name=\"faith\" />\n\n==College career==\n\n===Injury troubles and second chance===\nAs a freshman in 2006\u201307, Kendle attended [[Olney Central College|Olney Central Community College]] but managed just two games for the Blue Knights after sustaining a severe foot injury that required surgery. He returned home to Jeffersonville for the 2007\u201308 season and fully recovered. After his left foot healed, he re-joined the Blue Knights for the 2008\u201309 season,<ref>{{cite web | last=Hatten | first=Justin | url=http://www.olneydailymail.com/article/20081030/NEWS/310309955 | title=OCC hosts Sound Doctrine Saturday in season opener | work=OlneyDailyMail.com | date=October 30, 2008 | accessdate=December 27, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last=Martinez | first=Marcia | url=http://www.sj-r.com/article/20100308/NEWS/303089900 | title=Kendle carves up KWU to give Bellarmine GLVC title | work=SJ-R.com | date=March 8, 2010 | accessdate=December 27, 2015}}</ref> but on the first day of practice, he broke his right foot. After three months out, he came back and broke his right foot again in two different places. While a less driven athlete would have pulled the pin on his basketball career, Kendle had other ideas. He subsequently changed his diet and went through a vigorous therapy program.<ref name=\"faith\" />\n\nHis comeback in 2009 saw him earn a try-out with [[Bellarmine University]], despite his commitment to being a walk-on at the [[University of Southern Indiana]], a rival school of Bellarmine. He played well in the trial at Bellarmine, and a few days later, he was given a full scholarship.<ref name=\"faith\" /> Bellarmine was only a 20-minute drive from his family home which allowed him to spend time with his ill mother and gave his family the chance to watch him play regularly.<ref name=\"faith\" />\n\n===Bellarmine University===\n\n====2009\u201310 season====\nKendle began playing for the [[Bellarmine Knights]] during the 2009\u201310 season. Stringing together his first full college season, Kendle led the Knights in scoring with 17.7 points per game and subsequently earned second-team All-[[Great Lakes Valley Conference|GLVC]] honors. During the 2010 GLVC Tournament, he helped his team win the event while earning Tournament MVP and All-Tournament Team honors.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://athletics.bellarmine.edu/custompages/Sports/MBB/2010-11/2010-11%20MG%20FINAL.pdf | title=Bellarmine Basketball 2010\u201311 | work=Bellarmine.edu | accessdate=December 27, 2015 | page=6}}</ref>\n\n====2010\u201311 season====\nIn his second season playing for the Knights, Kendle garnered numerous awards.

Kendle helped lead Bellarmine to a 30\u20132 record and a trip to the NCAA Division II Elite 8 for the first time in school history. He went on to lead them even further as the Knights won their first NCAA Division II National Championship in 2010\u201311. Kendle subsequently earned NCAA Division II All-Tournament Team honors.\n\n====2011\u201312 season====\nIn August 2011, the NCAA granted Kendle two more seasons of college eligibility after deeming his first two seasons at Olney Central did not count due to his injuries.<ref>{{cite web | last=Taylor | first=Kent | url=http://www.wave3.com/story/15269527/kendle-gets-2-more-seasons-at-bellarmine | title=Kendle gets 2 more seasons at Bellarmine | work=Wave3.com | date=August 16, 2011 | accessdate=December 27, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last=Lester | first=Brian | url=https://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-men/article/2011-11-22/kendle-gets-one-more-chance | title=Kendle gets one more chance | work=NCAA.com | date=November 22, 2011 | accessdate=December 27, 2015}}</ref> As a junior in 2011\u201312, Kendle once again led the Knights back to the NCAA Division II Final Four and earned All-GLVC first team and NABC Division II All-America Team honors for a second straight year.

{"title_page": "Close central rounded vowel", "text_new": "{{Short description|Vowel sound in some languages}}\n{{Infobox IPA\n|ipa symbol=\u0289\n|ipa symbol2=\u00fc\n|ipa number=318\n|decimal=649\n|x-sampa=}\n|kirshenbaum=u\"\n|imagefile=Close central rounded vowel (vector).svg\n|imagesize=150px\n|braille=356\n|braille2=u\n}}\n{{IPA vowels|class=floatright}}\n\nThe '''close central rounded vowel''', or '''high central rounded vowel''',<ref>{{Vowel terminology}}</ref> is a type of [[vowel]] sound used in some spoken [[language]]s. The symbol in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] that represents this sound is {{angbr IPA|\u0289}}, and the equivalent [[X-SAMPA]] symbol is <code>}</code>.  Both the symbol and the sound are commonly referred to as \"barred u\".\n\nThe close central rounded vowel is the vocalic equivalent of the rare [[labialized post-palatal approximant]] {{IPA|[\u1e85]}}.<ref>Instead of \"post-palatal\", it can be called \"retracted palatal\", \"backed palatal\", \"palato-velar\", \"pre-velar\", \"advanced velar\", \"fronted velar\" or \"front-velar\".</ref>\n\nIn most languages this rounded vowel is pronounced with [[roundedness|protruded lips]] (''endolabial''). However, in a few cases the lips are compressed (''exolabial'').\n\nSome languages feature the '''near-close central rounded vowel''', which is slightly lower. It is most often transcribed in IPA with {{angbr IPA|\u0289\u031e}} and {{angbr IPA|\u028a\u0308}}, but other transcriptions such as {{angbr IPA|\u028a\u031f}} and {{angbr IPA|\u0275\u031d}} are also possible. The symbol {{angbr IPA|\u1d7f}}, a conflation of {{angbr IPA|\u028a}} and {{angbr IPA|\u0289}}, is used as an unofficial extension of the IPA to represent this sound by a number of publications, such as ''Accents of English'' by [[John C. Wells]]. In the third edition of the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', {{angbr IPA|\u1d7f}} represents [[free variation]] between {{IPA|/\u028a/}} and {{IPA|/\u0259/}}.\n\n==Close central protruded vowel==\nThe '''close central protruded vowel''' is typically transcribed in IPA simply as {{angbr IPA|\u0289}}, and that is the convention used in this article. As there is no dedicated [[IPA diacritic|diacritic]] for protrusion in the IPA, symbol for the close central rounded vowel with an old diacritic for labialization, {{angbr IPA|&nbsp;&nbsp;\u032b}}, can be used as an ''ad hoc'' symbol {{angbr IPA|\u0289\u032b}} for the close central protruded vowel. Another possible transcription is {{angbr IPA|\u0289\u02b7}} or {{angbr IPA|\u0268\u02b7}} (a close central vowel modified by endolabialization), but this could be misread as a diphthong.\n\n===Features===\n{{close vowel}}\n{{central vowel}}\n{{protruded vowel}}\n\n===Occurrence===\nBecause central rounded vowels are assumed to have protrusion, and few descriptions cover the distinction, some of the following may actually have compression.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"clear: both;\"\n! colspan=\"2\" | Language !!

"text_old": "{{Short description|Vowel sound in some languages}}\n{{Infobox IPA\n|ipa symbol=\u0289\n|ipa symbol2=\u00fc\n|ipa number=318\n|decimal=649\n|x-sampa=}\n|kirshenbaum=u\"\n|imagefile=Close central rounded vowel (vector).svg\n|imagesize=150px\n|braille=356\n|braille2=u\n}}\n{{IPA vowels|class=floatright}}\n\nThe '''close central rounded vowel''', or '''high central rounded vowel''',<ref>{{Vowel terminology}}</ref> is a type of [[vowel]] sound used in some spoken [[language]]s. The symbol in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] that represents this sound is {{angbr IPA|\u0289}}, and the equivalent [[X-SAMPA]] symbol is <code>}</code>.  Both the symbol and the sound are commonly referred to as \"barred u\".\n\nThe close central rounded vowel is the vocalic equivalent of the rare [[labialized post-palatal approximant]] {{IPA|[\u1e85]}}.<ref>Instead of \"post-palatal\", it can be called \"retracted palatal\", \"backed palatal\", \"palato-velar\", \"pre-velar\", \"advanced velar\", \"fronted velar\" or \"front-velar\".</ref>\n\nIn most languages this rounded vowel is pronounced with [[roundedness|protruded lips]] (''endolabial''). However, in a few cases the lips are compressed (''exolabial'').\n\nSome languages feature the '''near-close central rounded vowel''', which is slightly lower. It is most often transcribed in IPA with {{angbr IPA|\u0289\u031e}} and {{angbr IPA|\u028a\u0308}}, but other transcriptions such as {{angbr IPA|\u028a\u031f}} and {{angbr IPA|\u0275\u031d}} are also possible. The symbol {{angbr IPA|\u1d7f}}, a conflation of {{angbr IPA|\u028a}} and {{angbr IPA|\u0289}}, is used as an unofficial extension of the IPA to represent this sound by a number of publications, such as ''Accents of English'' by [[John C. Wells]]. In the third edition of the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', {{angbr IPA|\u1d7f}} represents [[free variation]] between {{IPA|/\u028a/}} and {{IPA|/\u0259/}}.\n\n==Close central protruded vowel==\nThe '''close central protruded vowel''' is typically transcribed in IPA simply as {{angbr IPA|\u0289}}, and that is the convention used in this article. As there is no dedicated [[IPA diacritic|diacritic]] for protrusion in the IPA, symbol for the close central rounded vowel with an old diacritic for labialization, {{angbr IPA|&nbsp;&nbsp;\u032b}}, can be used as an ''ad hoc'' symbol {{angbr IPA|\u0289\u032b}} for the close central protruded vowel. Another possible transcription is {{angbr IPA|\u0289\u02b7}} or {{angbr IPA|\u0268\u02b7}} (a close central vowel modified by endolabialization), but this could be misread as a diphthong.\n\n===Features===\n{{close vowel}}\n{{central vowel}}\n{{protruded vowel}}\n\n===Occurrence===\nBecause central rounded vowels are assumed to have protrusion, and few descriptions cover the distinction, some of the following may actually have compression.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"clear: both;\"\n! colspan=\"2\" | Language !!
