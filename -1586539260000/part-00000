Santa Elena was ultimately built at the site of the abandoned French outpost of [[Charlesfort]], founded in 1562 by [[Jean Ribault]].\n\nSanta Elena was founded following the destruction of the French Fort Caroline by Men\u00e9ndez in 1565. The settlement housed a sizeable community, and became the base of operations for the [[Jesuit]]s and military working in the northern zone of [[Spanish Florida]]. From this base the Spanish founded a number of other ephemeral forts as far inland as the [[Appalachian Mountains]], but resistance from local [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes and the lack of interest of Spain in the area, caused these to be abandoned, relocated or destroyed. Santa Elena was ultimately abandoned in 1587, with its survivors relocating to St. Augustine. The Spanish never pressed their colonial claims to the area again, focusing on other areas of the American continent.\n\n==History==\nInterest in the area was piqued following exploration of some part of what is now the coastal southeastern United States by Francisco Gordillo and Pedro de Quejo in 1521. Accounts of the region's abundance from Quejo and [[Francisco de Chicora]], one of the 70 Indians the expedition brought to [[Hispaniola]], inspired [[Lucas V\u00e1zquez de Ayll\u00f3n]] to establish the short-lived colony of [[San Miguel de Gualdape]]. This was abandoned after only a few months. In 1540 [[Hernando de Soto]]'s expedition found European goods in the wealthy town of Cofitachequi, and thus determined they were near the site of Ayll\u00f3n's colony; their accounts of the wealthy land inspired further colonial ambitions. In 1559, [[Trist\u00e1n de Luna y Arellano]] established a settlement at present-day [[Pensacola, Florida]], as a base for future colonization of Santa Elena, but this mission failed. The French also heard the early accounts and took an interest in the area; in 1562 [[Jean Ribault]] came to Parris Island and set up the short-lived settlement of [[Charlesfort]] there. However, this was abandoned the following year.<ref>Hoffman, Paul E. (2004).

The ''[[Oberkommando der Marine]]'' or ''OKM'', (the German naval high command), had decided near the end of World War II to put all of its resources into building newer types of ''Unterseeboot'', such as the types [[Type XXI submarine|XXI]] and [[Type XXIII submarine|XXIII]]. ''U-1308'' was part of a batch of eight U-boats (U-1301 to U-1308) ordered on 1 August 1942 to be built at [[Flensburger Schiffbau-Gesellschaft]], [[Flensburg]] ({{coord|54.80833|9.435173|scale:5000|format=dms}}). She was laid down on 16 February 1944 and launched on 22 November. The eight boats were commissioned over a 12-month period between February 1944 and 17 January 1945 .\n\nAs ''U-1308'' was the last Type VII, the ''Kriegsmarine'' fitted her out to be one of the most advanced. ''U-1308'' was one of nine Type VIIs that the ''Kriegsmarine'' fitted with an experimental synthetic rubber skin of [[anechoic tile]]s known as ''Alberich'', which had been designed to counter the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]' asdic/sonar devices. ''U-1308'' was also one of two [[German Type VII submarine#Type VIIC/41|Type VIIC/41]]s that was equipped with a new design of passive sonar hydrophones, thus increasing detection ranges by approximately 70% over the older designs.\n\nA few days before Germany surrendered on 8 May 1945, ''U-1308'' was taken approximately {{convert|5|km|nmi|abbr=on}} north-west of [[Warnem\u00fcnde]] and [[Scuttling|scuttled]] on 2 May at approximately {{coord|54.216667|12.033333|scale:100000|format=dms|display=title, inline}}. During the final days of Nazi Germany there was a plethora of U-boats which suffered the same fate. In the last week of the war, 28 other boats joined her.\n\n==Emblem==\n''U-1308''{{'}}s emblem was an oak leaf, with an anchor and a knife or dagger.

The ''[[Oberkommando der Marine]]'' or ''OKM'', (the German naval high command), had decided near the end of World War II to put all of its resources into building newer types of ''Unterseeboot'', such as the types [[Type XXI submarine|XXI]] and [[Type XXIII submarine|XXIII]]. ''U-1308'' was part of a batch of eight U-boats (U-1301 to U-1308) ordered on 1 August 1942 to be built at [[Flensburger Schiffbau-Gesellschaft]], [[Flensburg]] ({{coord|54.80833|9.435173|scale:5000|format=dms}}). She was laid down on 16 February 1944 and launched on 22 November. The eight boats were commissioned over a 12-month period between February 1944 and 17 January 1945 .\n\nAs ''U-1308'' was the last Type VII, the ''Kriegsmarine'' fitted her out to be one of the most advanced. ''U-1308'' was one of nine Type VIIs that the ''Kriegsmarine'' fitted with an experimental synthetic rubber skin of [[anechoic tile]]s known as ''Alberich'', which had been designed to counter the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]' asdic/sonar devices. ''U-1308'' was also one of two [[German Type VII submarine#Type VIIC/41|Type VIIC/41]]s that was equipped with a new design of passive sonar hydrophones, thus increasing detection ranges by approximately 70% over the older designs.\n\nA few days before Germany surrendered on 8 May 1945, ''U-1308'' was taken approximately {{convert|5|km|nmi|abbr=on}} north-west of [[Warnem\u00fcnde]] and [[Scuttling|scuttled]] on 2 May at approximately {{coord|54.216667|12.033333|scale:100000|format=dms|display=title, inline}}.

They have reached also twice the [[CEV Cup]] final (1979\u201380, 2008\u201309).\n\nNotable Greek player have played for the team, while foreign world-class players that have played with the club include [[Dante Amaral]], [[Marcelo Elgarten]], [[Andr\u00e9 Nascimento]], [[Frank Depestele]], [[Liberman Agamez]], [[:fr:Peter Pl\u00e1ten\u00edk|Peter Pl\u00e1ten\u00edk]], [[Jakub Novotn\u00fd]], [[Plamen Konstantinov]], [[Boyan Yordanov]], [[Bj\u00f6rn Andrae]], [[Andrija Geri\u0107]], [[Clayton Stanley]], [[Ernardo G\u00f3mez]], [[:fr:Renaud Herpe|Renaud Herpe]], [[Guillaume Samica]], [[Dawid Murek]], [[Pawe\u0142 Zagumny]] and [[\u0141ukasz \u017bygad\u0142o]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Giorgos Kalafatis 1911.jpg|thumb|left|120px|[[Georgios Kalafatis]]]]\n\nThe volleyball department of Panathinaikos was founded in 1919 and is one of the first in [[Greece]]. With the participation of [[Giorgos Kalafatis]] in the [[Inter-Allied Games]] of [[Paris]] in 1919, and the informations he collected, the sport became more known in [[Greece]]. The same year the officials of the club decided the creation of a volleyball team.\n\nThe first dynamic presence of the team is dated back in the years 1927\u201329 with many popular players of the time such as the founder [[Giorgos Kalafatis]], the historical member of the board [[Apostolos Nikolaidis (athlete)|Apostolos Nikolaidis]], as well as players such as [[Athanasios Aravositas]], Goumas, Arg. Nikolaidis, Papageorgiou and Papastefanou. In the following years the interest for volleyball became less until before [[World War II]] when Panathinaikos presented a powerful team with leader players such as Lambrou, Vallidis, Momferatos, Tzoumanis, Proselentis, Lykouris, Kakridis and more.\n\nDuring the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s, Panathinaikos' volleyball club won many titles and honors due to the fact that the team roster has always included some of the leading volleyball players and coaches in Greece. The first and most popular generation of players of 60\u2019s was Andreas and Nikos Bergeles, as well as Iliopoulos, Leloudas, Chasapis, Emmanouil, Perros and Fotiou who opened the road for the next generations. Notable coaches of this era was the leading figure of the department [[Gerasimos Theodoratos]], the [[Yugoslavia]]n [[Sava Grozdanovi\u0107]] and later the ex-player of the team [[Andreas Bergeles]].\n\nThe most important achievement of the team was the participation in the final of the European Cup in 1980 with Grozdanovi\u0107 as coach and players such as Georgantis, Agrapidakis, Iliopoulos, Papadopoulos, Malousaris, Gountakos, Astras, Kokkinaras and Koliopoulos. In the following years, Panathinaikos team continued to dominate the Greek championship with [[Janusz Badora]] as coach and players such as Kazazis, Tentzeris, Gontikas, Galakos, Dimitriadis, Margaronis, Karamaroudis and Andreopoulos.\n\nTwo of the most successful periods have been 1994-95 and 1995-96 seasons, when Panathinaikos won 2 consecutive championships with Stelios Prosalikas as head coach and Andreopoulos, Triantafillidis, Filippov, Spanos, Hatziantoniou, Ouzounov, A. Kovacev, S. Kovacev, Karamaroudis, Mavrakis, Konstantinidis, Zakynthinos, Koutouleas, Tonev as players.\n\nIn 2001 the department became professional under the presidency and financial support of [[Vlassis Stathokostopoulos]] and later [[Thanasis Giannakopoulos]].\n\nIn 2004 the team won the Championship with the ex-player Stelios Kazazis as coach. WIth the [[Brazil]]ian star-player [[Dante Amaral]] and [[Marcelo Elgarten]], they made a strong team and finished again first in 2006, while they reached again the final of the European Cup in 2009.\n\n==Honours==\n===Domestic===\n* '''[[A1 Ethniki Volleyball|Greek Championship]]:<ref>{{cite

Founded in 1919, it is one of the oldest and most successful volleyball clubs in [[Greece]]. They have won 18 [[A1 Ethniki Volleyball|Greek Championships]] finishing 6 times undefeated (1962\u201363, 1965\u201366, 1966\u201367, 1969\u201370, 1970\u201371, 1974\u201375), 6 [[Greek Volleyball Cup|Greek Cups]], 1 [[Greek Volleyball League Cup|Greek League Cup]] and 1 [[Greek Volleyball Super Cup|Greek Super Cup]]. They have reached also twice the [[CEV Cup]] final (1979\u201380, 2008\u201309).\n\nNotable Greek player have played for the team, while foreign world-class players that have played with the club include [[Dante Amaral]], [[Marcelo Elgarten]], [[Andr\u00e9 Nascimento]], [[Frank Depestele]], [[Liberman Agamez]], [[:fr:Peter Pl\u00e1ten\u00edk|Peter Pl\u00e1ten\u00edk]], [[Jakub Novotn\u00fd]], [[Plamen Konstantinov]], [[Boyan Yordanov]], [[Bj\u00f6rn Andrae]], [[Andrija Geri\u0107]], [[Clayton Stanley]], [[Ernardo G\u00f3mez]], [[:fr:Renaud Herpe|Renaud Herpe]], [[Guillaume Samica]], [[Dawid Murek]], [[Pawe\u0142 Zagumny]] and [[\u0141ukasz \u017bygad\u0142o]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Giorgos Kalafatis 1911.jpg|thumb|left|120px|[[Georgios Kalafatis]]]]\n\nThe volleyball department of Panathinaikos was founded in 1919 and is one of the first in [[Greece]]. With the participation of [[Giorgos Kalafatis]] in the [[Inter-Allied Games]] of [[Paris]] in 1919, and the informations he collected, the sport became more known in [[Greece]]. The same year the officials of the club decided the creation of a volleyball team.\n\nThe first dynamic presence of the team is dated back in the years 1927\u201329 with many popular players of the time such as the founder [[Giorgos Kalafatis]], the historical member of the board [[Apostolos Nikolaidis (athlete)|Apostolos Nikolaidis]], as well as players such as [[Athanasios Aravositas]], Goumas, Arg. Nikolaidis, Papageorgiou and Papastefanou. In the following years the interest for volleyball became less until before [[World War II]] when Panathinaikos presented a powerful team with leader players such as Lambrou, Vallidis, Momferatos, Tzoumanis, Proselentis, Lykouris, Kakridis and more.\n\nDuring the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s, Panathinaikos' volleyball club won many titles and honors due to the fact that the team roster has always included some of the leading volleyball players and coaches in Greece. The first and most popular generation of players of 60\u2019s was Andreas and Nikos Bergeles, as well as Iliopoulos, Leloudas, Chasapis, Emmanouil, Perros and Fotiou who opened the road for the next generations. Notable coaches of this era was the leading figure of the department [[Gerasimos Theodoratos]], the [[Yugoslavia]]n [[Sava Grozdanovi\u0107]] and later the ex-player of the team [[Andreas Bergeles]].\n\nThe most important achievement of the team was the participation in the final of the European Cup in 1980 with Grozdanovi\u0107 as coach and players such as Georgantis, Agrapidakis, Iliopoulos, Papadopoulos, Malousaris, Gountakos, Astras, Kokkinaras and Koliopoulos. In the following years, Panathinaikos team continued to dominate the Greek championship with [[Janusz Badora]] as coach and players such as Kazazis, Tentzeris, Gontikas, Galakos, Dimitriadis, Margaronis, Karamaroudis and Andreopoulos.\n\nTwo of the most successful periods have been 1994-95 and 1995-96 seasons, when Panathinaikos won 2 consecutive championships with Stelios Prosalikas as head coach and Andreopoulos, Triantafillidis, Filippov, Spanos, Hatziantoniou, Ouzounov, A. Kovacev, S. Kovacev, Karamaroudis, Mavrakis, Konstantinidis, Zakynthinos, Koutouleas, Tonev as players.\n\nIn 2001 the department became professional under the presidency and financial support of [[Vlassis Stathokostopoulos]] and later [[Thanasis Giannakopoulos]].\n\nIn 2004 the team won the Championship with the ex-player Stelios Kazazis as coach. WIth the [[Brazil]]ian star-player [[Dante Amaral]] and [[Marcelo Elgarten]], they made a strong team and finished again first in 2006, while they reached again the final of the European Cup in 2009.\n\n==Honours==\n===Domestic===\n* '''[[A1 Ethniki Volleyball|Greek Championship]]:<ref>{{cite

Offutt researches with gusto, both in and out of books, having\u2014briefly and painfully, he says\u2014worn [[chainmail]] and helm and wielded sword. He is also tired of aged, bald, ugly, sexless mages and squeaky females in heroic fantasy\".'\n\n==Life and family==\nOffutt was born in a log cabin near Taylorsville, [[Kentucky]]. He was married for more than 50 years to Jodie McCabe Offutt of Lexington, Kentucky. They had four children: writer [[Chris Offutt]]; [[Jeff Offutt]], Professor of Software Engineering at George Mason University; Scotty Hyde, copy editor for the ''Park City Daily News'' in Bowling Green, Kentucky; and Melissa Offutt, a sales executive for Sprint in San Diego. Offutt also had five grandchildren, Sam, Steffi, James, Joyce, and Andrew.\n\n==Career in speculative fiction==\n[[File:If 195412.jpg|thumb|right|Offutt's first story, \"And Gone Tomorrow, appeared in the December 1954 issue of ''If''.]]\nOffutt began publishing in 1954 with the story \"And Gone Tomorrow\" in the magazine ''[[If magazine|If]]''.  Despite this early sale, he did not consider his professional life to have begun until he sold the story \"Blacksword\" to ''[[Galaxy Magazine|Galaxy]]'' in 1959. His first true science fiction novel was ''Evil Is Live Spelled Backwards'' in 1970. Offutt disliked the title of this book, calling it \"embarrassingly amateur\".\n\nOffutt wrote numerous novels and short stories, including several in the \"[[Thieves World]]\" series edited by [[Robert Lynn Asprin]] and [[Lynn Abbey]], which feature his best known character, the thief, Hanse, also known as [[List of Thieves World Characters#Shadowspawn|Shadowspawn]] (and, later, Chance).  His \"Iron Lords\" series, likewise, was popular. Offutt also wrote two series of books based on characters by [[Robert E. Howard]]. There was a series on Howard's best known character, [[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]], and another one on the less known [[Tigers of the Sea|Cormac mac Art]]\u2014an Irish Viking active in [[King Arthur]]'s time. In fact, Offutt wrote about him far more extensively than did Howard himself.\n\nAs \"John Cleve\", Offutt also wrote the 19-book [[erotic]] [[science fiction]] series \"Spaceways\", over half of which were collaborations.\n\nAs an editor Offutt produced a series of five anthologies entitled ''Swords Against Darkness'', which included the first professional sale by [[Charles de Lint]]. From 1976 to 1978 he served as president of the [[Science Fiction Writers of America]] (SFWA).\n\n==Career in erotica==\nOffutt wrote at least 420 pornographic/erotic works under seventeen different pen-names and house-names, including Opal Andrews, \"Anonymous,\" Joe Brown, John Cleve, Camille Colben, Jack Cory, Jeremy Crebb, P. N. Dedeaux,<ref name=\"amazon.com\">https://www.amazon.com/P.-N.-Dedeaux/e/B001K8LFD2/ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_2?qid=1458793230&sr=8-2</ref> John Denis, Jeff Douglas, Farrah Fawkes, Baxter Giles, Alan Marshall, Jeff Morehead, J. (John) X. Williams, Turk Winter, and Jeff Woodson.<ref name=\"MD\"/><ref name=\"Trussel\"/> The first was ''Bondage Babes'', published under the name Alan Marshall by Greenleaf in 1968; the first appearance of his principal pen name, John Cleve, was on ''Slave of the Sudan'' in 1969.<ref name=\"MD\"/>\n\nAccording to his son Chris Offutt he came to regard Cleve as more a separate persona than a pen name, and his other aliases as Cleve's pen names, not his own. As \"Cleve\" he published more than 130 works of erotica before the market for erotica dried up about 1985; afterwards, turning to self-publishing, he issued 260 more as Turk Winter (an early \"Cleve\" pen name) over the next twenty-five years. Thirty more remained unpublished at the time of his death. So prolific was Offutt in this area that in summing up his writing career his son Chris wrote that he \"came to understand that my father had passed as a science-fiction writer while actually pursuing a 50-year career as a pornographer.\"<ref name=\"MD\"/>\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Thieves' World===\n* \"Shadowspawn\" (1979) in ''[[Thieves' World (1979 anthology)|Thieves' World]]''\n* \"Shadow's Pawn\" (1980)\n* \"The Vivisectionist\" (1981)\n* \"Godson\" (1982)\n* \"Rebels Aren't Born in Palaces\" (1984)\n* \"The Veiled Lady, or A Look at the Normal Folk\" (1985)\n* with Jodie Offutt, \"Spellmaster\" (1986)\n* \"Homecoming\" (1987)\n* ''Shadowspawn'' (1987)\n* \"Night Work\" (1989)\n* ''The Shadow of Sorcery'' (1993)\n* \"Role Model\" (2002)\n* \"Dark of the Moon\" (2004)\n\n===War of the Gods on Earth===\n* ''The Iron Lords'' (1979)\n* ''Shadows Out of Hell'' (1980)\n* ''The Lady of the Snowmist'' (1983)\n\n===War of the Wizards===\n* ''Demon in the Mirror'' (1977, with [[Richard K.

Offutt also had five grandchildren, Sam, Steffi, James, Joyce, and Andrew.\n\n==Career in speculative fiction==\n[[File:If 195412.jpg|thumb|right|Offutt's first story, \"And Gone Tomorrow, appeared in the December 1954 issue of ''If''.]]\nOffutt began publishing in 1954 with the story \"And Gone Tomorrow\" in the magazine ''[[If magazine|If]]''.  Despite this early sale, he did not consider his professional life to have begun until he sold the story \"Blacksword\" to ''[[Galaxy Magazine|Galaxy]]'' in 1959. His first true science fiction novel was ''Evil Is Live Spelled Backwards'' in 1970. Offutt disliked the title of this book, calling it \"embarrassingly amateur\".\n\nOffutt wrote numerous novels and short stories, including several in the \"[[Thieves World]]\" series edited by [[Robert Lynn Asprin]] and [[Lynn Abbey]], which feature his best known character, the thief, Hanse, also known as [[List of Thieves World Characters#Shadowspawn|Shadowspawn]] (and, later, Chance).  His \"Iron Lords\" series, likewise, was popular. Offutt also wrote two series of books based on characters by [[Robert E. Howard]]. There was a series on Howard's best known character, [[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]], and another one on the less known [[Tigers of the Sea|Cormac mac Art]]\u2014an Irish Viking active in [[King Arthur]]'s time. In fact, Offutt wrote about him far more extensively than did Howard himself.\n\nAs \"John Cleve\", Offutt also wrote the 19-book [[erotic]] [[science fiction]] series \"Spaceways\", over half of which were collaborations.\n\nAs an editor Offutt produced a series of five anthologies entitled ''Swords Against Darkness'', which included the first professional sale by [[Charles de Lint]]. From 1976 to 1978 he served as president of the [[Science Fiction Writers of America]] (SFWA).\n\n==Career in erotica==\nOffutt wrote at least 420 pornographic/erotic works under seventeen different pen-names and house-names, including Opal Andrews, \"Anonymous,\" Joe Brown, John Cleve, Camille Colben, Jack Cory, Jeremy Crebb, P. N. Dedeaux,<ref name=\"amazon.com\">https://www.amazon.com/P.-N.-Dedeaux/e/B001K8LFD2/ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_2?qid=1458793230&sr=8-2</ref> John Denis, Jeff Douglas, Farrah Fawkes, Baxter Giles, Alan Marshall, Jeff Morehead, J. (John) X. Williams, Turk Winter, and Jeff Woodson.<ref name=\"MD\"/><ref name=\"Trussel\"/> The first was ''Bondage Babes'', published under the name Alan Marshall by Greenleaf in 1968; the first appearance of his principal pen name, John Cleve, was on ''Slave of the Sudan'' in 1969.<ref name=\"MD\"/>\n\nAccording to his son Chris Offutt he came to regard Cleve as more a separate persona than a pen name, and his other aliases as Cleve's pen names, not his own. As \"Cleve\" he published more than 130 works of erotica before the market for erotica dried up about 1985; afterwards, turning to self-publishing, he issued 260 more as Turk Winter (an early \"Cleve\" pen name) over the next twenty-five years. Thirty more remained unpublished at the time of his death. So prolific was Offutt in this area that in summing up his writing career his son Chris wrote that he \"came to understand that my father had passed as a science-fiction writer while actually pursuing a 50-year career as a pornographer.\"<ref name=\"MD\"/>\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Thieves' World===\n* \"Shadowspawn\" (1979) in ''[[Thieves' World (1979 anthology)|Thieves' World]]''\n* \"Shadow's Pawn\" (1980)\n* \"The Vivisectionist\" (1981)\n* \"Godson\" (1982)\n* \"Rebels Aren't Born in Palaces\" (1984)\n* \"The Veiled Lady, or A Look at the Normal Folk\" (1985)\n* with Jodie Offutt, \"Spellmaster\" (1986)\n* \"Homecoming\" (1987)\n* ''Shadowspawn'' (1987)\n* \"Night Work\" (1989)\n* ''The Shadow of Sorcery'' (1993)\n* \"Role Model\" (2002)\n* \"Dark of the Moon\" (2004)\n\n===War of the Gods on Earth===\n* ''The Iron Lords'' (1979)\n* ''Shadows Out of Hell'' (1980)\n* ''The Lady of the Snowmist'' (1983)\n\n===War of the Wizards===\n* ''Demon in the Mirror'' (1977, with [[Richard K.
