After many years, the Queen's Magic Mirror confirms Snow White as being the \"fairest of them all\", which causes the Queen to cast Snow White out and send a huntsman to kill her. But when he refuses to do so because she means no harm, the huntsman helps Snow White escape into the forest. Snow White stumbles upon the home of the [[Seven Dwarfs]], who happily aid her.\n\nThe Queen discovers that Snow White has survived, so she uses magic to disguise herself as an old hag and creates a poisoned apple that will put anyone who eats it into a \u201cSleeping Death\" from which only the kiss of true love will revive. When the dwarfs are away the hag arrives at the dwarfs\u2019 cottage and offers Snow White the poisoned apple, unbeknownst to her that it is the Queen in disguise. Snow White bites into the apple and falls into a coma. Upon discovering what had happened, the dwarfs track down the Queen; a short fight ensues and the Queen is killed. Believing her dead too, the dwarfs build an open grave for Snow White to rest on. Time passes and Prince Florian comes across Snow White. Saddened by her apparent death, he kisses her, causing her to awaken.

She has [[short hair]], and a [[Hair#Texture|curly]] bob hairstyle that gives her a childlike appearance. Her voice and speech patterns are also childlike. Her delicate [[high-heeled shoe]]s complete her youthful appearance.<ref name=Ghent/> While the Snow White depicted by the [[Brothers Grimm]] was about 7-years-old, Disney's Snow White is an adolescent (her exact age is never specified).<ref name=Ghent/>\n\nWhen lost in the forest, Snow White appears rather clumsy. Her dress gets stuck in tree branches, and she briefly falls into a lake. Yet, other scenes depict Snow White's movements as \"graceful, stately, and elegant\", indicative of an aristocratic upbringing. When she joins her unnamed prince on his horse, Snow White rides [[sidesaddle]]. Another indication of her \"dainty\" and \"ladylike\" style.<ref name=Ghent/>\n\nSnow White's clothing is traditionally feminine, and rather [[Prude|prudish]] in covering as much skin as possible. Her main costume is a long dress, with a white [[Collar (clothing)|collar]], blue and puffy [[sleeve]]s, a yellow [[skirt]], and a laced [[petticoat]]. She also wears a brown [[cape]] with a red interior, high-heeled shoes with a bow-like [[ribbon]] on each of them, and a red ribbon on her hair.<ref name=Ghent/>\n\nSnow White's innocent-looking appearance contrasts with that her stepmother's [[sexual maturity]], both in appearance and demeanor. Yet the [[Narcissism|narcissistic]] desire of the Queen to become the most beautiful woman sets the conflict between stepmother and stepdaughter. The mirror serves as the \"male judge of female beauty\" in this contest, and the Queen seemingly depends on the mirror's \"judgmental voice\" in her self-evaluation.<ref name=Ghent/> While both women are depicted as beautiful in the film, the passive, sweet young girl is evaluated as being better than her fierce and cold-mannered stepmother.<ref name=Ghent/>\n\n====Development====\n\nAnimators' initial sketches for Snow White's character, some of which bore a resemblance to [[Betty Boop]], did not meet [[Walt Disney]]'s expectations, as they were too cartoonish.<ref name=\"Platinum\">{{cite video|title=Still The Fairest of Them All: The Making of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs|location=''Snow White and the Seven Dwarves: Platinum Edition''|year=2001|publisher=[[Walt Disney Home Entertainment]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite video |people= [[Dick Van Dyke]], [[Jane Curtin]], [[Sherman Hemsley]]|date2= |month2= |year2= |title= Golden Anniversary of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs|year=1987|url=|format= |medium= |publisher= [[Disney Channel]]|location= |accessdate= |time=|quote= }}</ref> [[Hamilton Luske]], whom Disney had selected as the supervising animator for Snow White's character, was tasked with the challenge of making Snow White more believably human and realistic than any of the Disney studio's previous animated characters.

Of that project, Les Clark later remarked, \"I'm sure Walt was thinking ahead to ''Snow White''.\" Though the Persephone character ended up appearing somewhat lifeless and devoid of personality, that experiment in imitating realistic human movement and anatomy was continued and its lessons were applied in the development of Snow White's animation techniques.<ref name=\"Thomas\">{{cite book |author=Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston |title= Disney Animation: The Illusion of Life|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/25187588/The-Illusion-of-Life-Disney-Animation |accessdate= |year= 1981|publisher= Abbeville Press, Disney Editions|location= |isbn= 0896592332|page= 109}}</ref> Snow White and the Queen were refined by [[Grim Natwick]] and [[Norm Ferguson (animator)|Norm Ferguson]], who would often override Walt Disney's instructions.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2002&dat=19870415&id=yOlVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=z0ANAAAAIBAJ&pg=1114,2955720 Biggest opening day in film history is coming up], ''Beaver County Times'', April 15, 1987.</ref>\n\nThe relatively new technique of using live-action footage as a reference for character movements was used extensively to bring Snow White's character to life. A young dancer named [[Marge Champion|Marjorie Celeste Belcher]] (nicknamed Margie Bell) served as the live-action model for Snow White. (Margie Bell, daughter of animator Ernest Belcher, also later modeled for the Blue Fairy character in Disney's 1940 film ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]''.) Hamilton Luske directed her through the filming of numerous movement sequences, and then the animators studied and copied the footage to enhance the realism of Snow White's animated movements. Animator [[Ollie Johnston]] later recalled, \"Ham's careful planning and shooting of the live-action footage, always with the idea in mind of how it would be used in animation, resulted in a very convincing character.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://disney.go.com/disneyinsider/history/legends/ham-luske|title=D23.com - Disney Legends|work=D23.com}}</ref>\n\nOriginally, Disney could not find what they thought was a suitable voice for Snow White.

After many years, the Queen's Magic Mirror confirms Snow White as being the \"fairest of them all\", which causes the Queen to cast Snow White out and send a huntsman to kill her. But when he refuses to do so because she means no harm, the huntsman helps Snow White escape into the forest. Snow White stumbles upon the home of the [[Seven Dwarfs]], who happily aid her.\n\nThe Queen discovers that Snow White has survived, so she uses magic to disguise herself as an old hag and creates a poisoned apple that will put anyone who eats it into a \u201cSleeping Death\" from which only the kiss of true love will revive. When the dwarfs are away the hag arrives at the dwarfs\u2019 cottage and offers Snow White the poisoned apple, unbeknownst to her that it is the Queen in disguise. Snow White bites into the apple and falls into a coma. Upon discovering what had happened, the dwarfs track down the Queen; a short fight ensues and the Queen is killed. Believing her dead too, the dwarfs build an open grave for Snow White to rest on. Time passes and the Prince comes across Snow White. Saddened by her apparent death, he kisses her, causing her to awaken.

She has [[short hair]], and a [[Hair#Texture|curly]] bob hairstyle that gives her a childlike appearance. Her voice and speech patterns are also childlike. Her delicate [[high-heeled shoe]]s complete her youthful appearance.<ref name=Ghent/> While the Snow White depicted by the [[Brothers Grimm]] was about 7-years-old, Disney's Snow White is an adolescent (her exact age is never specified).<ref name=Ghent/>\n\nWhen lost in the forest, Snow White appears rather clumsy. Her dress gets stuck in tree branches, and she briefly falls into a lake. Yet, other scenes depict Snow White's movements as \"graceful, stately, and elegant\", indicative of an aristocratic upbringing. When she joins her unnamed prince on his horse, Snow White rides [[sidesaddle]]. Another indication of her \"dainty\" and \"ladylike\" style.<ref name=Ghent/>\n\nSnow White's clothing is traditionally feminine, and rather [[Prude|prudish]] in covering as much skin as possible. Her main costume is a long dress, with a white [[Collar (clothing)|collar]], blue and puffy [[sleeve]]s, a yellow [[skirt]], and a laced [[petticoat]]. She also wears a brown [[cape]] with a red interior, high-heeled shoes with a bow-like [[ribbon]] on each of them, and a red ribbon on her hair.<ref name=Ghent/>\n\nSnow White's innocent-looking appearance contrasts with that her stepmother's [[sexual maturity]], both in appearance and demeanor. Yet the [[Narcissism|narcissistic]] desire of the Queen to become the most beautiful woman sets the conflict between stepmother and stepdaughter. The mirror serves as the \"male judge of female beauty\" in this contest, and the Queen seemingly depends on the mirror's \"judgmental voice\" in her self-evaluation.<ref name=Ghent/> While both women are depicted as beautiful in the film, the passive, sweet young girl is evaluated as being better than her fierce and cold-mannered stepmother.<ref name=Ghent/>\n\n====Development====\n\nAnimators' initial sketches for Snow White's character, some of which bore a resemblance to [[Betty Boop]], did not meet [[Walt Disney]]'s expectations, as they were too cartoonish.<ref name=\"Platinum\">{{cite video|title=Still The Fairest of Them All: The Making of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs|location=''Snow White and the Seven Dwarves: Platinum Edition''|year=2001|publisher=[[Walt Disney Home Entertainment]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite video |people= [[Dick Van Dyke]], [[Jane Curtin]], [[Sherman Hemsley]]|date2= |month2= |year2= |title= Golden Anniversary of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs|year=1987|url=|format= |medium= |publisher= [[Disney Channel]]|location= |accessdate= |time=|quote= }}</ref> [[Hamilton Luske]], whom Disney had selected as the supervising animator for Snow White's character, was tasked with the challenge of making Snow White more believably human and realistic than any of the Disney studio's previous animated characters.

Of that project, Les Clark later remarked, \"I'm sure Walt was thinking ahead to ''Snow White''.\" Though the Persephone character ended up appearing somewhat lifeless and devoid of personality, that experiment in imitating realistic human movement and anatomy was continued and its lessons were applied in the development of Snow White's animation techniques.<ref name=\"Thomas\">{{cite book |author=Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston |title= Disney Animation: The Illusion of Life|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/25187588/The-Illusion-of-Life-Disney-Animation |accessdate= |year= 1981|publisher= Abbeville Press, Disney Editions|location= |isbn= 0896592332|page= 109}}</ref> Snow White and the Queen were refined by [[Grim Natwick]] and [[Norm Ferguson (animator)|Norm Ferguson]], who would often override Walt Disney's instructions.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2002&dat=19870415&id=yOlVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=z0ANAAAAIBAJ&pg=1114,2955720 Biggest opening day in film history is coming up], ''Beaver County Times'', April 15, 1987.</ref>\n\nThe relatively new technique of using live-action footage as a reference for character movements was used extensively to bring Snow White's character to life. A young dancer named [[Marge Champion|Marjorie Celeste Belcher]] (nicknamed Margie Bell) served as the live-action model for Snow White. (Margie Bell, daughter of animator Ernest Belcher, also later modeled for the Blue Fairy character in Disney's 1940 film ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]''.) Hamilton Luske directed her through the filming of numerous movement sequences, and then the animators studied and copied the footage to enhance the realism of Snow White's animated movements. Animator [[Ollie Johnston]] later recalled, \"Ham's careful planning and shooting of the live-action footage, always with the idea in mind of how it would be used in animation, resulted in a very convincing character.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://disney.go.com/disneyinsider/history/legends/ham-luske|title=D23.com - Disney Legends|work=D23.com}}</ref>\n\nOriginally, Disney could not find what they thought was a suitable voice for Snow White.
