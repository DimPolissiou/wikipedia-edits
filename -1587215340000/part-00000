The Governor is appointed by the monarch on the advice of the [[British government]]. The role of the Governor is to act as the ''de facto'' [[head of state]], and he or she is responsible for appointing the [[Premier of Bermuda|Premier]] and the 11 members of the [[Senate of Bermuda|Senate]] (the upper house of [[Parliament of Bermuda|Bermuda's Parliament]]).\n\nThe Governor is also Commander-in-Chief of Bermuda, in control of the [[Royal Bermuda Regiment]] (all that remains of the [[Bermuda Garrison]]). Until 1867, the Governor also held the appointment of Vice-Admiral of Bermuda.\n\nThe current Governor is [[John Rankin (diplomat)|John Rankin]]; he was sworn in on 5 December 2016.\n\nThe Governor has his own flag in Bermuda, a [[Union Flag]] with the [[Coat of Arms of Bermuda|territory's coat of arms]] superimposed.\n\n==History==\nBermuda's settlement began in 1609, with the wrecking of the flagship of the [[London Company|Virginia Company]], the ''[[Sea Venture]]''. Although most of the passengers and crew ultimately completed their voyage to [[Virginia]], the archipelago was permanently settled from that point, and left in the hands of the Virginia Company. The first intentional settlers arrived in 1612, under Richard Moore, whose appointment was officially as the Deputy Governor of Bermuda. Sir Thomas Smith remained in England as the first Governor and Treasurer of Bermuda. A carpenter by trade, Moore ensured the long-term survival of the colony by concentrating on building fortifications, including the [[Castle Islands Fortifications, Bermuda|first stone forts in the English New World]], and developing [[St. George's, Bermuda|St. George's Town]]. Moore brought with him to Bermuda two consecutively numbered boxes. The first, only to be opened in the case of his death, incapacitation or absence from the colony, contained the name of the settler who was to replace him. In the case of that settler also having died, or otherwise being incapable of taking the office, a second was named in the other box. More was also instructed to appoint a ''Counsell of Six'' to assist in the governance of the colony. The six appointed Counsellors were Captain Miles Kendall, Captain John Mansfield, Thomas Knight, Charles Caldycot, Edward Waters, and Christopher Carter (Carter was among three men who had first arrived in Bermuda with the 1609 wreck of the [[Sea Venture]]. He had remained behind with Robert Waters when the ''Deliverance'' and ''Patience'' had departed for Jamestown in 1610 with the remainder of the Sea Venture's passengers and crew, and remained again with Robert Waters and Edward Chard, after the Patience had returned from Jamestown and departed once more in the same year for England).\n\nBermuda was the second permanent English colony established (as an extension of the first, [[Jamestown, Virginia]]). Bermuda was administered under [[Royal charter]]s by the Virginia Company, and its successor, the [[Somers Isles Company]], which appointed the colony's governors until the Crown revoked the charter and took over administration in 1684. With the transfer to the Somers Isles Company in 1615, Sir Thomas Smith remained in England as Governor and Treasurer of Bermuda, and Captain [[Daniel Tucker (colonial administrator)|Daniel Tucker]] was sent to Bermuda in 1616 aboard the ''George'', in consort with the ''Edwin'', to succeed Moore as Deputy Governor. Twenty-four Assistants were also appointed. By the 1630s, the Somers Isles Company had ceased sending Governors to Bermuda and had begun appointing prominent Bermudians, such as [[William Sayle]], to the position.\n\nThe Crown maintained the system of government established under the company; an elected parliament (originally a single [[House of Assembly]], which held is first session in 1620) which held its and a privy council under a governor. The Privy Council, made up of the Chief Justice, certain senior civil servants, and appointees, was also known as the Governor's Council and the Legislative Council (most of its responsibilities are now filled by the Cabinet and the [[Senate of Bermuda]], with the Council now only an advisory body for the Governor). The last company-appointed Governor was reappointed by the Crown. In 1707 the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British State]] was created by the union of the [[Kingdom of England]] with the [[Kingdom of Scotland]], and Bermuda thereby became a British colony. Since the 1783 independence of Virginia, it has been Britain's oldest colony. Following US independence, Bermuda became an important [[Royal Navy]] base, with a large [[Bermuda Garrison|military garrison]] to guard it.<ref>\"The Andrew and the Onions: The Story of the Royal Navy in Bermuda, 1795\u20131975\", Lt. Commander Ian Strannack, The Bermuda Maritime Museum Press, The Bermuda Maritime Museum</ref> As such, the policy of the government until the closure of the [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda|Royal Naval dockyard]] in 1953 had been to appoint retiring Generals or Admirals as Bermuda's Governor and Commander-in-Chief. On the rare occasions when a civilian was appointed to the role, it was only as Governor \u2013 the role of Commander-in-Chief being filled by a serving General or Admiral in Bermuda or Newfoundland. Since the 1950s, those appointed Governor and Commander-in-Chief have tended to be prominent career-politicians at the ends of their political lives.\n\nPrior to the creation of the lower (and, originally, ''only'') [[House (legislature)|house]] of the [[Parliament of Bermuda]], the [[House of Assembly of Bermuda|House of Assembly]], in 1620, the Governors ruled supreme, and were often draconian. Governor [[Daniel Tucker (Governor)|Daniel Tucker]], formerly of Virginia, who arrived in 1616, was notorious for his harshness, having many islanders hanged, maimed, or whipped on the slightest provocation. One Bermudian, John Wood, was hanged for airing his views on the Governor in church. Governor Tucker's personal boat was reportedly stolen by five islanders, one named Saunders, who left a note saying they were ''on their way to England, or [[Davy Jones' Locker]], either place being preferable'' to Bermuda under Tucker's rule. On reaching England, they complained about the harshness of Tucker's rule, though their complaints fell on deaf ears. Governor Tucker also, reportedly, used his oversight of the surveying of Bermuda to enrich himself and future generations of Bermudian Tuckers with prime real estate when he appropriated the ''overplus'' (surplus) land left after [[Richard Norwood]]'s 1616 survey of the colony. Much of this land, forming an estate known as ''The Grove'', would still be in the hands of his relatives during the [[American War of Independence]].\n\nFor the remainder of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the real political power in Bermuda lay in the elected parliament and the appointed Council, both dominated by members of Bermuda's wealthy commercial class. By the mid-Seventeenth Century, the Somers Isles Company had ceased sending Governors from overseas, and instead appointed Bermudians such as [[William Sayle]] from this same local elite; a policy which ended after the [[English Civil War|Civil Wars]], during which Bermuda tended to the Royalist side. After the regicide, Bermuda was the first colony to recognize [[King Charles II of England|Charles II]]. With control of \"the Army\" (the local militia), the royalists ousted the [[Somers Isles Company]]'s Governor, Captain Thomas Turner, and elected John Trimingham as their leader. \n\nGovernors who were too high-handed or injudicious in the exercise of their office occasionally fell foul of the local political institutions. Governor Isaac Richier, who arrived in 1691, quickly made himself unpopular with his carousing and criminal behaviour. Bermudian complaints saw him placed in jail, and replaced by Governor Goddard. When Goddard proved worse than Richier, attorney general Samuel Trott had him jailed alongside Richier. The two governors were to be tried before a pair of prominent Bermudians, John Trimmingham and William Butterfield. After Trott called the amateur judges ''bush lawyers'', however, he found himself in St. George's jail alongside the governors. After they confided in him their plan for escape, Trott informed the judges. Richier and Goddard were sent back to England for trial.<ref>\"Bermuda in Three Colours\", Carveth Wells. Robert M. McBride & Company, New York. 1935.</ref>\n\n[[File:Government House, Mount Langton.jpg|thumb|left|Government House, Mount Langton. This became Government House when the colonial capital was moved from [[St. George's, Bermuda|St. George's]] to the [[Hamilton, Bermuda|City of Hamilton]] in 1815, and was replaced with the current building on the same grounds.]]\nAt the written request of [[George Washington]], during the course of the [[American War of Independence]], 100 barrels of gunpowder were stolen from a magazine in St. George's and provided to the American rebels. No one was ever prosecuted in relation to this act of treason. The theft had been the result of a conspiracy involving powerful Bermudians, who were motivated as much by Bermuda's desperate plight, denied her primary trading partner and source of food, as by any favourable sentiments they may have had in regard to either the American colonists or their cause. The chief conspirator was [[Henry Tucker (of The Grove)|Henry Tucker of The Grove]] (the ''overplus'' estate appropriated in 1616 by Governor Daniel Tucker), a Member of the House of Assembly, former Member of the Council, and Militia officer (soon to be promoted to Colonel), who had plotted with [[Benjamin Franklin]] while attending the rebel [[Continental Congress]] as a delegate for Bermuda. Two of his sons served in the rebel Army and were to achieve high office in the post-War US Government. A third son, also named ''Henry Tucker'', was at the time the President of the Council (and later acting Governor on multiple occasions), and married to the daughter of Governor [[George James Bruere]]. Following this, Bermudians and their political institutions were looked at suspiciously by the British Government.\n\n[[File:Governor of Bermuda at Prospect Camp 1902.jpg|thumb|Governor Lt. Gen. Sir Henry LeGuay Geary, KCB (right), at [[Prospect Camp, Bermuda]], on Tuesday, the 11 March, 1902 to decorate three officers with the DSO]]\nWith the buildup of the naval and military bases on the island following American independence, the position of the Governor was enhanced. Despite this, the Governors \u2013 appointed by the Crown \u2013 remained largely dependent on the Bermudian parliament to pass laws and to provide funds. This fact often found Governors pleading in vain for the required acts of parliament or money to carry out policies determined at Government House, or in London. This was particularly noticeable in the Bermudian Parliament's neglect to maintain militia, which (other than during the course of the [[War of 1812|American War of 1812]]), it allowed to become moribund after the build-up of the naval and military base began in 1795.\n\nAttempts to raise militias directly under the control of the Governor, without acts of the local parliament, ultimately failed because the parliament did not provide funds. In the 1860s, it became the policy of the British Government to reduce the costly professional military garrison in Bermuda. As it was not wished to leave the colony, seen more as a naval base, unguarded, this could only be done if the professional soldiers were replaced with part-time [[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)|Volunteer]] units. Successive governors were set the task of convincing the Bermudian parliament to raise the required units, but, concerned of being saddled with the cost of maintaining the entire garrison, as well as with the possibility for social disruption that could be caused by raising either racially segregated or integrated units, the Bermudian Parliamentarians simply refused. This state of affairs continued until the [[Secretary of State for War]] found a lever (the [[The Fairmont Hamilton Princess|Princess Hotel]]) to blackmail the Bermuda Parliament with in 1885, which resulted it finally passing acts in 1892 for the creation of militia and volunteer forces (although the units would be entirely funded by the British Government).<ref>\"Defence, Not Defiance: A History of the Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps\", Jennifer M.

Itself using as a source the unique, typescript \"History of The Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps, 1891\u20131933\", held at the Bermuda Library, in Hamilton.</ref> Struggles between the Governor and the Parliament would continue to recur. In 1939, the Governor, General Sir [[Reginald Hildyard]], resigned his post, reportedly because the Bermudian Parliament refused to allow him a motor car (motor vehicles having been banned in Bermuda before the [[First World War]], following a petition signed by numerous Bermudians, and by visitors including [[Woodrow Wilson]]).\n\nOn 10 March 1973, the 121st Governor, [[Richard Sharples]], and his aide-de-camp Captain [[Hugh Sayers]], were assassinated in an attack by a Bermudian black activist named Buck Burrows and an accomplice, Larry Tacklin, who were members of the Black Beret Cadres. Under Bermudian law at the time, premeditated murder was a capital offence, and death sentences were often handed out, though routinely commuted. No death sentence had been carried out since the 1940s. After much debate due to the controversial moral issues raised, the sentence stood despite a 6,000-strong petition from Bermudians to the Queen. Both men were hanged in 1977 for the killings and other murders, sparking riots throughout Bermuda. Buck Burrows explained in his confession that he had killed the Governor to prove that he was not untouchable and that white-dominated politics was fallible. He was also found guilty of murdering the police commissioner, George Duckett, six months earlier on 9 September 1972, and of killing the co-owner and book-keeper of a supermarket called the Shopping Centre, Victor Rego and Mark Doe in April 1973.\n\n==List of Governors of Bermuda==\n[[File:George James Bruere.png|thumb|[[George James Bruere]], in office from 1764 to 1780, the longest-serving of all Bermuda's Governors]]\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n# 1612\u20131616 Richard Moore (Deputy Governor in Bermuda.

The Governor is appointed by the monarch on the advice of the [[British government]]. The role of the Governor is to act as the ''de facto'' [[head of state]], and he or she is responsible for appointing the [[Premier of Bermuda|Premier]] and the 11 members of the [[Senate of Bermuda|Senate]] (the upper house of [[Parliament of Bermuda|Bermuda's Parliament]]).\n\nThe Governor is also Commander-in-Chief of Bermuda, in control of the [[Royal Bermuda Regiment]] (all that remains of the [[Bermuda Garrison]]). Until 1867, the Governor also held the appointment of Vice-Admiral of Bermuda.\n\nThe current Governor is [[John Rankin (diplomat)|John Rankin]]; he was sworn in on 5 December 2016.\n\nThe Governor has his own flag in Bermuda, a [[Union Flag]] with the [[Coat of Arms of Bermuda|territory's coat of arms]] superimposed.\n\n==History==\nBermuda's settlement began in 1609, with the wrecking of the flagship of the [[London Company|Virginia Company]], the ''[[Sea Venture]]''. Although most of the passengers and crew ultimately completed their voyage to [[Virginia]], the archipelago was permanently settled from that point, and left in the hands of the Virginia Company. The first intentional settlers arrived in 1612, under Richard Moore, whose appointment was officially as the Deputy Governor of Bermuda. Sir Thomas Smith remained in England as the first Governor and Treasurer of Bermuda. A carpenter by trade, Moore ensured the long-term survival of the colony by concentrating on building fortifications, including the [[Castle Islands Fortifications, Bermuda|first stone forts in the English New World]], and developing [[St. George's, Bermuda|St. George's Town]]. Moore brought with him to Bermuda two consecutively numbered boxes. The first, only to be opened in the case of his death, incapacitation or absence from the colony, contained the name of the settler who was to replace him. In the case of that settler also having died, or otherwise being incapable of taking the office, a second was named in the other box. More was also instructed to appoint a ''Counsell of Six'' to assist in the governance of the colony. The six appointed Counsellors were Captain Miles Kendall, Captain John Mansfield, Thomas Knight, Charles Caldycot, Edward Waters, and Christopher Carter (Carter was among the three men who had arrived in Bermuda with the 1609 wreck of the [[Sea Venture]] and had remained behind with Robert Waters when the Deliverance and Patience had departed for Jamestown in 1610 with the remainder of the Sea Venture's passengers and crew, and with Robert Waters and Edward Chard, after the Patience had returned and departed again in the same year for England).\n\nBermuda was the second permanent English colony established (as an extension of the first, [[Jamestown, Virginia]]). Bermuda was administered under [[Royal charter]]s by the Virginia Company, and its successor, the [[Somers Isles Company]], which appointed the colony's governors until the Crown revoked the charter and took over administration in 1684. With the transfer to the Somers Isles Company in 1615, Sir Thomas Smith remained in England as Governor and Treasurer of Bermuda, and Captain [[Daniel Tucker (colonial administrator)|Daniel Tucker]] was sent to Bermuda in 1616 aboard the ''George'', in consort with the ''Edwin'', to succeed Moore as Deputy Governor. Twenty-four Assistants were also appointed. By the 1630s, the Somers Isles Company had ceased sending Governors to Bermuda and had begun appointing prominent Bermudians, such as [[William Sayle]], to the position.\n\nThe Crown maintained the system of government established under the company; an elected parliament (originally a single [[House of Assembly]], which held is first session in 1620) which held its and a privy council under a governor. The Privy Council, made up of the Chief Justice, certain senior civil servants, and appointees, was also known as the Governor's Council and the Legislative Council (most of its responsibilities are now filled by the Cabinet and the [[Senate of Bermuda]], with the Council now only an advisory body for the Governor). The last company-appointed Governor was reappointed by the Crown. In 1707 the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British State]] was created by the union of the [[Kingdom of England]] with the [[Kingdom of Scotland]], and Bermuda thereby became a British colony. Since the 1783 independence of Virginia, it has been Britain's oldest colony. Following US independence, Bermuda became an important [[Royal Navy]] base, with a large [[Bermuda Garrison|military garrison]] to guard it.<ref>\"The Andrew and the Onions: The Story of the Royal Navy in Bermuda, 1795\u20131975\", Lt. Commander Ian Strannack, The Bermuda Maritime Museum Press, The Bermuda Maritime Museum</ref> As such, the policy of the government until the closure of the [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda|Royal Naval dockyard]] in 1953 had been to appoint retiring Generals or Admirals as Bermuda's Governor and Commander-in-Chief. On the rare occasions when a civilian was appointed to the role, it was only as Governor \u2013 the role of Commander-in-Chief being filled by a serving General or Admiral in Bermuda or Newfoundland. Since the 1950s, those appointed Governor and Commander-in-Chief have tended to be prominent career-politicians at the ends of their political lives.\n\nPrior to the creation of the lower (and, originally, ''only'') [[House (legislature)|house]] of the [[Parliament of Bermuda]], the [[House of Assembly of Bermuda|House of Assembly]], in 1620, the Governors ruled supreme, and were often draconian. Governor [[Daniel Tucker (Governor)|Daniel Tucker]], formerly of Virginia, who arrived in 1616, was notorious for his harshness, having many islanders hanged, maimed, or whipped on the slightest provocation. One Bermudian, John Wood, was hanged for airing his views on the Governor in church. Governor Tucker's personal boat was reportedly stolen by five islanders, one named Saunders, who left a note saying they were ''on their way to England, or [[Davy Jones' Locker]], either place being preferable'' to Bermuda under Tucker's rule. On reaching England, they complained about the harshness of Tucker's rule, though their complaints fell on deaf ears. Governor Tucker also, reportedly, used his oversight of the surveying of Bermuda to enrich himself and future generations of Bermudian Tuckers with prime real estate when he appropriated the ''overplus'' (surplus) land left after [[Richard Norwood]]'s 1616 survey of the colony. Much of this land, forming an estate known as ''The Grove'', would still be in the hands of his relatives during the [[American War of Independence]].\n\nFor the remainder of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the real political power in Bermuda lay in the elected parliament and the appointed Council, both dominated by members of Bermuda's wealthy commercial class. By the mid-Seventeenth Century, the Somers Isles Company had ceased sending Governors from overseas, and instead appointed Bermudians such as [[William Sayle]] from this same local elite; a policy which ended after the [[English Civil War|Civil Wars]], during which Bermuda tended to the Royalist side. After the regicide, Bermuda was the first colony to recognize [[King Charles II of England|Charles II]]. With control of \"the Army\" (the local militia), the royalists ousted the [[Somers Isles Company]]'s Governor, Captain Thomas Turner, and elected John Trimingham as their leader. \n\nGovernors who were too high-handed or injudicious in the exercise of their office occasionally fell foul of the local political institutions. Governor Isaac Richier, who arrived in 1691, quickly made himself unpopular with his carousing and criminal behaviour. Bermudian complaints saw him placed in jail, and replaced by Governor Goddard. When Goddard proved worse than Richier, attorney general Samuel Trott had him jailed alongside Richier. The two governors were to be tried before a pair of prominent Bermudians, John Trimmingham and William Butterfield. After Trott called the amateur judges ''bush lawyers'', however, he found himself in St. George's jail alongside the governors. After they confided in him their plan for escape, Trott informed the judges. Richier and Goddard were sent back to England for trial.<ref>\"Bermuda in Three Colours\", Carveth Wells. Robert M. McBride & Company, New York. 1935.</ref>\n\n[[File:Government House, Mount Langton.jpg|thumb|left|Government House, Mount Langton. This became Government House when the colonial capital was moved from [[St. George's, Bermuda|St. George's]] to the [[Hamilton, Bermuda|City of Hamilton]] in 1815, and was replaced with the current building on the same grounds.]]\nAt the written request of [[George Washington]], during the course of the [[American War of Independence]], 100 barrels of gunpowder were stolen from a magazine in St. George's and provided to the American rebels. No one was ever prosecuted in relation to this act of treason. The theft had been the result of a conspiracy involving powerful Bermudians, who were motivated as much by Bermuda's desperate plight, denied her primary trading partner and source of food, as by any favourable sentiments they may have had in regard to either the American colonists or their cause. The chief conspirator was [[Henry Tucker (of The Grove)|Henry Tucker of The Grove]] (the ''overplus'' estate appropriated in 1616 by Governor Daniel Tucker), a Member of the House of Assembly, former Member of the Council, and Militia officer (soon to be promoted to Colonel), who had plotted with [[Benjamin Franklin]] while attending the rebel [[Continental Congress]] as a delegate for Bermuda. Two of his sons served in the rebel Army and were to achieve high office in the post-War US Government. A third son, also named ''Henry Tucker'', was at the time the President of the Council (and later acting Governor on multiple occasions), and married to the daughter of Governor [[George James Bruere]]. Following this, Bermudians and their political institutions were looked at suspiciously by the British Government.\n\n[[File:Governor of Bermuda at Prospect Camp 1902.jpg|thumb|Governor Lt. Gen. Sir Henry LeGuay Geary, KCB (right), at [[Prospect Camp, Bermuda]], on Tuesday, the 11 March, 1902 to decorate three officers with the DSO]]\nWith the buildup of the naval and military bases on the island following American independence, the position of the Governor was enhanced. Despite this, the Governors \u2013 appointed by the Crown \u2013 remained largely dependent on the Bermudian parliament to pass laws and to provide funds. This fact often found Governors pleading in vain for the required acts of parliament or money to carry out policies determined at Government House, or in London. This was particularly noticeable in the Bermudian Parliament's neglect to maintain militia, which (other than during the course of the [[War of 1812|American War of 1812]]), it allowed to become moribund after the build-up of the naval and military base began in 1795.\n\nAttempts to raise militias directly under the control of the Governor, without acts of the local parliament, ultimately failed because the parliament did not provide funds. In the 1860s, it became the policy of the British Government to reduce the costly professional military garrison in Bermuda. As it was not wished to leave the colony, seen more as a naval base, unguarded, this could only be done if the professional soldiers were replaced with part-time [[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)|Volunteer]] units. Successive governors were set the task of convincing the Bermudian parliament to raise the required units, but, concerned of being saddled with the cost of maintaining the entire garrison, as well as with the possibility for social disruption that could be caused by raising either racially segregated or integrated units, the Bermudian Parliamentarians simply refused. This state of affairs continued until the [[Secretary of State for War]] found a lever (the [[The Fairmont Hamilton Princess|Princess Hotel]]) to blackmail the Bermuda Parliament with in 1885, which resulted it finally passing acts in 1892 for the creation of militia and volunteer forces (although the units would be entirely funded by the British Government).<ref>\"Defence, Not Defiance: A History of the Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps\", Jennifer M. Ingham (now Jennifer M. Hind), {{ISBN|0-9696517-1-6}}. Printed by The Island Press Ltd., Pembroke, Bermuda. Itself using as a source the unique, typescript \"History of The Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps, 1891\u20131933\", held at the Bermuda Library, in Hamilton.</ref> Struggles between the Governor and the Parliament would continue to recur. In 1939, the Governor, General Sir [[Reginald Hildyard]], resigned his post, reportedly because the Bermudian Parliament refused to allow him a motor car (motor vehicles having been banned in Bermuda before the [[First World War]], following a petition signed by numerous Bermudians, and by visitors including [[Woodrow Wilson]]).\n\nOn 10 March 1973, the 121st Governor, [[Richard Sharples]], and his aide-de-camp Captain [[Hugh Sayers]], were assassinated in an attack by a Bermudian black activist named Buck Burrows and an accomplice, Larry Tacklin, who were members of the Black Beret Cadres. Under Bermudian law at the time, premeditated murder was a capital offence, and death sentences were often handed out, though routinely commuted. No death sentence had been carried out since the 1940s. After much debate due to the controversial moral issues raised, the sentence stood despite a 6,000-strong petition from Bermudians to the Queen. Both men were hanged in 1977 for the killings and other murders, sparking riots throughout Bermuda. Buck Burrows explained in his confession that he had killed the Governor to prove that he was not untouchable and that white-dominated politics was fallible. He was also found guilty of murdering the police commissioner, George Duckett, six months earlier on 9 September 1972, and of killing the co-owner and book-keeper of a supermarket called the Shopping Centre, Victor Rego and Mark Doe in April 1973.\n\n==List of Governors of Bermuda==\n[[File:George James Bruere.png|thumb|[[George James Bruere]], in office from 1764 to 1780, the longest-serving of all Bermuda's Governors]]\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n# 1612\u20131616 Richard Moore (Deputy Governor in Bermuda.

Contemporary boats are usually made of [[fibreglass]], although wooden boats are still built.\n\nIt is one of the most popular sailing dinghies in the world, with over 150,000 boats officially registered with the class and many more built but never registered.\n\nThe Optimist is recognized as an [[International Class]] by the [[International Sailing Federation]].\n\n==Origin==\nThe Optimist was designed in 1947 by American [[Clark Mills (boatbuilder and designer)|Clark Mills]] at the request of the Clearwater Florida Optimist service club following a proposal by Major Clifford McKay to offer low-cost sailing for young people.<ref name=\"Bird2013\">Bird, Vanessa (2013). \"Optimist\", ''Classic Classes'', A&C Black. {{ISBN|9781408158906}}. p.53</ref> The Optimist Club ran a [[soap box derby]], but wanted more than a single-day event.

Sailors can continue to race them up to the age limit of 15 years old. Optimists are single handed boats. Many sailing schools and yacht clubs own a number of them and they are the first boat most beginners will sail.\n\n==Description==\n\n===Rig===\n\nThe single [[sail]] of the Optimist is [[spritsail|sprit-rigged]]. Two [[Parts of a sail|batten]]s stiffen the [[Parts of a sail#Non-triangular fore and aft sails|leech]]. It is secured evenly with ties along the [[Parts of a sail#Non-triangular fore and aft sails|luff]] to the [[mast (sailing)|mast]] and along the [[Parts of a sail#Non-triangular fore and aft sails|foot]] to the [[boom (sailing)|boom]], pulled down tightly by a [[boom vang|vang/kicker]]. The light, slim third [[spar (sailing)|spar]], the sprit, extends through a loop at the [[Parts of a sail#Non-triangular fore and aft sails|peak]] of the sail; the bottom rests in the eye of a short cable or string which hangs along the front edge of the mast. Raising and lowering the sprit and adjusting the boom vang allow for adaptation of sail trim to a range of wind conditions. Similarly, the Optimist has a small string outhaul on the end of the boom. It is usually correct to tighten the boomvang, outhaul, and sprit in heavy winds and loosen them in light winds. As well as this, huge adjustments can be made to sail shape, due to all of the ties running along the mast and boom.\n\nThe spars may be made from aluminium or wood, but are invariably aluminium in modern boats.\n\nA monograph-style \"IO\" insignia (after IODA - the International Optimist Dinghy Association) on the sail is a registered trade-mark and may only be used under licence from the International Optimist Association. Optimists also have a national sail number using the Olympic abbreviation of their country and a sequential numbers. e.g. RSA for South Africa.\n\n===Hull===\nThe Optimist has a [[Pram (boat)|pram]] hull, originally formed primarily from five pieces of plywood. It was the biggest hull Clark Mills could make from two 4&nbsp;ft by 8&nbsp;ft sheets. Just in front of a [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]], which partitions the boat nearly in half, is the [[daggerboard]] case. Right behind it on the centerline of the hull floor are attached a pulley and ratchet [[block (sailing)|block]]. These anchor the [[Sheet (sailing)|sheet]] and its pulley on the boom directly above. At the [[bow (ship)|bow]] resides a thwart to support the mast which passes through a hole in its centre to the mast step mounted on the centre line of the boat. The painter, a rope used for securing a boat like a mooring line, is usually tied around the mast step.\n\nBuoyancy bags are installed inboard along each side in the front half of the boat and at the stern to add buoyancy in the event of capsizing. Two straps, known as \"hiking straps\", run lengthwise along the floor from bulkhead to [[stern]]. These and a tiller extension allow a sailor to hang off the side for weight distribution\u2014commonly called \"hiking out\". This can be crucial to maintaining the boat in near horizontal disposition during heavy air, allowing greater speed through the water and more manoeuvrability.\n\nThe vast majority of hulls today are made of [[Fiberglass]],<ref>{{cite book |last1=Pickthall |first1=Barr |title=Dinghy sailing : start to finish |date=2009 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=9780470721858 |page=25 |ref=pickthall}}</ref> although it is still possible to make and buy wooden hulls.\n\n===Foils===\nThe [[rudder]] and daggerboard can be made from plywood or a composite of foam, glass fibre, and epoxy.\n\n===Performance===\nWhile younger lighter sailors begin in Optimists, competitive sailors usually weigh between 35 and 55&nbsp;kg (or between 80&nbsp;lbs. and 125&nbsp;lbs.).<ref>http://www.wilkessail.net/idealsize.pdf</ref> Optimists can be sailed by children from age 8 to 15. This wide range of weights which is not typical of most dinghies is made possible by different cuts of sail.

Sailors can continue to race them up to the age limit of 15 years old. Optimists are single handed boats. Many sailing schools and yacht clubs own a number of them and they are the first boat most beginners will sail.\n\n==Description==\n\n===Rig===\n\nThe single [[sail]] of the Optimist is [[spritsail|sprit-rigged]]. Two [[Parts of a sail|batten]]s stiffen the [[Parts of a sail#Non-triangular fore and aft sails|leech]]. It is secured evenly with ties along the [[Parts of a sail#Non-triangular fore and aft sails|luff]] to the [[mast (sailing)|mast]] and along the [[Parts of a sail#Non-triangular fore and aft sails|foot]] to the [[boom (sailing)|boom]], pulled down tightly by a [[boom vang|vang/kicker]]. The light, slim third [[spar (sailing)|spar]], the sprit, extends through a loop at the [[Parts of a sail#Non-triangular fore and aft sails|peak]] of the sail; the bottom rests in the eye of a short cable or string which hangs along the front edge of the mast. Raising and lowering the sprit and adjusting the boom vang allow for adaptation of sail trim to a range of wind conditions. Similarly, the Optimist has a small string outhaul on the end of the boom. It is usually correct to tighten the boomvang, outhaul, and sprit in heavy winds and loosen them in light winds. As well as this, huge adjustments can be made to sail shape, due to all of the ties running along the mast and boom.\n\nThe spars may be made from aluminium or wood, but are invariably aluminium in modern boats.\n\nA monograph-style \"IO\" insignia (after IODA - the International Optimist Dinghy Association) on the sail is a registered trade-mark and may only be used under licence from the International Optimist Association. Optimists also have a national sail number using the Olympic abbreviation of their country and a sequential numbers. e.g. RSA for South Africa.\n\n===Hull===\nThe Optimist has a [[Pram (boat)|pram]] hull, originally formed primarily from five pieces of plywood. It was the biggest hull Clark Mills could make from two 4&nbsp;ft by 8&nbsp;ft sheets. Just in front of a [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]], which partitions the boat nearly in half, is the [[daggerboard]] case. Right behind it on the centerline of the hull floor are attached a pulley and ratchet [[block (sailing)|block]]. These anchor the [[Sheet (sailing)|sheet]] and its pulley on the boom directly above. At the [[bow (ship)|bow]] resides a thwart to support the mast which passes through a hole in its centre to the mast step mounted on the centre line of the boat. The painter, a rope used for securing a boat like a mooring line, is usually tied around the mast step.\n\nBuoyancy bags are installed inboard along each side in the front half of the boat and at the stern to add buoyancy in the event of capsizing. Two straps, known as \"hiking straps\", run lengthwise along the floor from bulkhead to [[stern]]. These and a tiller extension allow a sailor to hang off the side for weight distribution\u2014commonly called \"hiking out\". This can be crucial to maintaining the boat in near horizontal disposition during heavy air, allowing greater speed through the water and more manoeuvrability.\n\nThe vast majority of hulls today are made of [[Fiberglass]],<ref>{{cite book |last1=Pickthall |first1=Barr |title=Dinghy sailing : start to finish |date=2009 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=9780470721858 |page=25 |ref=pickthall}}</ref> although it is still possible to make and buy wooden hulls.\n\n===Foils===\nThe [[rudder]] and daggerboard can be made from plywood or a composite of foam, glass fibre, and epoxy.\n\n===Performance===\nWhile younger lighter sailors begin in Optimists, competitive sailors usually weigh between 35 and 55&nbsp;kg (or between 80&nbsp;lbs. and 125&nbsp;lbs.).<ref>http://www.wilkessail.net/idealsize.pdf</ref> Optimists can be sailed by children from age 8 to 15. This wide range of weights which is not typical of most dinghies is made possible by different cuts of sail. Due to its inherent stability, unstayed rig, robust construction and relatively small sail, the Optimist can be sailed in winds of up to 30 knots.\n\nOptimists are manufactured to the same specification by over 20 builders on four continents. There is strong evidence<ref>http://www.wilkessail.net/ParityBlurbC.pdf</ref> that hulls from different builders are the same speed. Sails and spars of differing qualities enable sailors to upgrade their equipment as they progress. \n\nThe Optimist is the slowest dinghy in the world according to the [[Royal Yachting Association|RYA]] [[Portsmouth Yardstick]] scheme, with a Portsmouth number of 1646.<ref name=\"RYA2012\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rya.org.uk/SiteCollectionDocuments/technical/Web%20Documents/py-general/2012%20listv3.xls |title=Portsmouth Number List 2012 |publisher=Royal Yachting Association |accessdate=31 July 2012}}</ref> Its equivalent rating in the US scheme is a D-PN of 123.6.<ref name=\"UScb\">{{cite web |url=http://offshore.ussailing.org/Portsmouth_Yardstick/Current_Tables/Centerboard_Classes.htm |title=Centerboard Classes |publisher=US Sailing |accessdate=31 July 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120816160142/http://offshore.ussailing.org/Portsmouth_Yardstick/Current_Tables/Centerboard_Classes.htm |archivedate=16 August 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Competition==\n\n\nThe Optimist is the biggest youth racing class in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sailing.org/boatclasses.php|title=Classes & Equipment Index|work=sailing.org|accessdate=8 July 2016}}</ref> As well as the annual world championship the class also has six continental championships, attended by a total of over 850 sailors a year.<ref>http://www.wilkessail.net/REVIEWOF2008.doc</ref> Many of the top world Optimist sailors have become world-class [[Laser Radial]] or [[Laser 4.7|4.7]] sailors after they \"age-out\" but many also excel in double-handers such as the [[420 (dinghy)|420]] and [[29er (boat)|29er]].\nAt the 2016 Olympics at least 85% of the boat skippers were former Optimist sailors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wilkessail.net/ExOptimistOlympians2016.htm|title=Ex-Optimists at 206 Olympics|publisher=|accessdate=12 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe first World Championship was held in Great Britain in 1962 and it has grown to over 60 countries participating.<ref>http://www.wilkessail.net/ParticipationGraph.html</ref> The changing pattern of the strongest countries can be seen from the results of the Nations Cup.<ref>http://www.wilkessail.net/IODANationsCup.html</ref> For the first 20 years, the class was dominated by sailors from the Scandinavian countries, with 13 world champions.

The names of these German settlers can be seen in the names of streets in Nundah and surrounding suburbs such as Rode Road and Gerler Road.\n\n====Growth of the village of German Station====\nA prominent local citizen who contributed significantly to the development of the village of German Station was [[George Bridges (Nundah pioneer)|George Bridges]] (1820\u20131898). George and his young family immigrated from [[Wilstead]], [[Bedfordshire]], England to Queensland in 1852 aboard the \"Marie Somes\". In 1855, he acquired {{convert|64|acre|ha}} of land north of Buckland Road and east of Sandgate Road for farming. However, as [[Sandgate, Queensland|Sandgate]] became an increasingly popular holiday destination, the increasing volume of coach traffic along Sandgate Road encouraged him to open a hotel, which became a popular stop being roughly halfway between [[Brisbane]] and Sandgate. The first hotel was called the Kedron Hotel but the third and longest-running hotel was known as the Kedron Brook Hotel and was located alongside Sandgate Road (now Bage St) on the SW corner of his property. Emboldened by the success of his hotel ventures, George Bridges looked for other commercial opportunities. He observed that Sandgate Road at that time did a dog-leg around the SW corner of his property (along Buckland Road) which forced traffic to travel up and over Donkin's Hill. So he created a short-cut across the SW corner of his property that avoided the hill, which was much appreciated by the travellers, allowing George Bridges to sell off parcels of land along this new unofficial piece of Sandgate Road to commercial enterprises, which serviced both the travellers and the local farming community. This unofficial short-cut grew into the Nundah Village shopping street that exists today and eventually became the official route of Sandgate Road. Around 1872, George and his wife Mary retired to [[Burpengary]] and began to progressively sell off the land of their German Station property as the village developed.\n[[File:Architectural plans for school and teachers residences located at German Station, circa 1880.jpg|thumb|Architectural plans for school and teachers residences at German Station, circa 1880]]\n\n====Creation of the suburb of Nundah====\nGerman Station State School opened on 2 October 1865 and was renamed Nundah State School in 1895.<ref>{{Citation|title=Queensland schools past and present|date=2010|author1=Queensland Family History Society|edition=Version 1.01|publisher=[[Queensland Family History Society]]|isbn=978-1-921171-26-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article1279287|title=The Courier.|date=27 September 1865|newspaper=[[The Brisbane Courier]]|accessdate=12 October 2017|issue=2,391|location=Queensland, Australia|volume=XX|page=2|via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nGerman Station remained an agricultural area until the 1880s.

It is adjacent to the suburbs of [[Clayfield, Queensland|Clayfield]], [[Northgate, Queensland|Northgate]] and [[Wavell Heights, Queensland|Wavell Heights]], and is dominated by a large ridge that runs from the northwest to the southeast.

Various facilities in Nundah are named after this locality, including the large shopping centre [[Centro Toombul]], [[Toombul Bus Station, Brisbane|Toombul Bus Station]] and the [[Toombul railway station, Brisbane|Toombul railway station]].\n\n[[Schulz Canal]] runs through Nundah, bisecting the Toombul Shopping Centre Carpark. The low elevation of the carpark makes it particularly susceptible to [[flash flood]]ing during peak storm seasons \u2013 often claiming the cars of unwary shoppers inside the centre and those attempting to cross the Melton Road bridge. The estuary of the canal is a moderately popular recreational fishing spot.\n\nCollege Estate, Nundah was advertised for public auction on Saturday 5 June 1937 by Cameron Brothers auctioneers. 54 splendid residential sites occupying one of the finest positions in Nundah were for sale.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article37049970|title=Advertising|date=19 May 1937|newspaper=[[The Courier-mail]]|accessdate=5 June 2019|issue=1159|location=Queensland, Australia|page=28|via=National Library of Australia}}</ref><ref>{{Cite document|title=College Estate, on the heights of nundah|hdl = 10462/deriv/264233}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Aboriginal history===\nLike most of Northern Brisbane,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pineriversshs.eq.edu.au/pages/school/history/north_pine_clan.htm|title=The North Pine Clan|publisher=[[Pine Rivers State High School]]|accessdate=26 January 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119051552/http://www.pineriversshs.eq.edu.au/pages/school/history/north_pine_clan.htm|archivedate=19 January 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref> the area around Nundah was dominated by the [[Turrbul]] tribe.<ref name=Events /> Their traditional coastal trade route passed through Nundah, near the modern-day Hedley Avenue.

The names of these German settlers can be seen in the names of streets in Nundah and surrounding suburbs such as Rode Road and Gerler Road.\n\n====Growth of the village of German Station====\nA prominent local citizen who contributed significantly to the development of the village of German Station was [[George Bridges (Nundah pioneer)|George Bridges]] (1820\u20131898). George and his young family immigrated from [[Wilstead]], [[Bedfordshire]], England to Queensland in 1852 aboard the \"Marie Somes\". In 1855, he acquired {{convert|64|acre|ha}} of land north of Buckland Road and east of Sandgate Road for farming. However, as [[Sandgate, Queensland|Sandgate]] became an increasingly popular holiday destination, the increasing volume of coach traffic along Sandgate Road encouraged him to open a hotel, which became a popular stop being roughly halfway between [[Brisbane]] and Sandgate. The first hotel was called the Kedron Hotel but the third and longest-running hotel was known as the Kedron Brook Hotel and was located alongside Sandgate Road (now Bage St) on the SW corner of his property. Emboldened by the success of his hotel ventures, George Bridges looked for other commercial opportunities. He observed that Sandgate Road at that time did a dog-leg around the SW corner of his property (along Buckland Road) which forced traffic to travel up and over Donkin's Hill. So he created a short-cut across the SW corner of his property that avoided the hill, which was much appreciated by the travellers, allowing George Bridges to sell off parcels of land along this new unofficial piece of Sandgate Road to commercial enterprises, which serviced both the travellers and the local farming community. This unofficial short-cut grew into the Nundah Village shopping street that exists today and eventually became the official route of Sandgate Road. Around 1872, George and his wife Mary retired to [[Burpengary]] and began to progressively sell off the land of their German Station property as the village developed.\n[[File:Architectural plans for school and teachers residences located at German Station, circa 1880.jpg|thumb|Architectural plans for school and teachers residences at German Station, circa 1880]]\n\n====Creation of the suburb of Nundah====\nGerman Station State School opened on 2 October 1865 and was renamed Nundah State School in 1895.<ref>{{Citation|title=Queensland schools past and present|date=2010|author1=Queensland Family History Society|edition=Version 1.01|publisher=[[Queensland Family History Society]]|isbn=978-1-921171-26-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article1279287|title=The Courier.|date=27 September 1865|newspaper=[[The Brisbane Courier]]|accessdate=12 October 2017|issue=2,391|location=Queensland, Australia|volume=XX|page=2|via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nGerman Station remained an agricultural area until the 1880s.
