Fulton, William D. Fulton and W.D.'s son, L.W. Fulton, arrived at the present site of Garden City.<ref name=\"http\">{{cite web | title = Garden City History | url =http://www.gardencity.net/info/history/garden/| format =English | accessdate =2009-03-13}}</ref>\n\nThe original townsite was laid out on the south half of section 18 by [[engineer]] Charles Van Trump. The land was a loose, [[sandy loam]] and covered with [[sagebrush]] and soap weeds, but there were no trees. Main Street ran directly north and south, dividing William D. and James R. Fulton's claims. As soon as they could get building material, they erected two frame houses. William D. Fulton building on his land, on the east side of Main Street, a house one story and a half high, with two rooms on the ground and two rooms above. This was called the Occidental Hotel. William D. Fulton was proprietor. No other houses were built in Garden City until November 1878, when James R. Fulton and L.T. Walker each put up a building. The Fultons tried to get others to settle here, but only a few came, and at the end of the first year there were only four buildings.<ref name=\"http\"/>\n\nFollowing a sustained [[drought]], [[irrigation]] arrived in Finney County in 1879, with completion of the \"Garden City Ditch\". The ditch helped to launch an agricultural boom in southwestern Kansas.<ref>Exhibit, Finney County Historical Museum, Garden City, Kansas</ref>\n\n===19th-century growth===\nCharles Jesse Jones, later known as \"Buffalo\" Jones, arrived in Garden City for an antelope hunt in January 1879. Before Jones returned home, the Fulton brothers procured his services to promote Garden City, and especially in trying to influence the [[Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railroad]] to put in a switch station. The railroad agreed to place its station at Garden City. In the spring of 1879, more people began arriving to homestead in the area. During the years of 1885-1887, a rush was made for Western Kansas, and a settler arrived for every quarter section. The [[United States Land Office]] also located at Garden City, and people went there to make filings on their land. Lawyers also arrived in Garden City. I.R. Holmes, the agent for the sale of lands of the ATSF, and Holmes' partner, A.C. McKeever, in 1885 sold thousands of acres of railroad and private land.<ref name=\"http\"/>\n\nThe streets of Garden City were crowded with horses, wagons, buggies and teams of oxen. Long lines of people stood out in the weather awaiting mail at the [[post office]], and there was always a crowd in front of the land office. During the height of the boom the town had nine lumber yards. Lumber was hauled in all directions to build up inland towns and to improve the nearby homesteads. Thirteen drug stores were in operation, and the town had two daily newspapers. Nearly everyone used kerosene lamps, and a few were placed on posts on Main Street. There was no city water works, so all depended on shallow wells, which were strongly alkaline. Passenger trains of two and three sections arrived daily, loaded with people, most of whom got off at Garden City.<ref name=\"http\"/>\n\nThe first issue of ''The Garden City Newspaper'' appeared April 3, 1879. Three months after the paper was established, the editor stated, \"There are now forty buildings in town.\" When the first telephone line was built, trees were growing on both sides of Main Street. These interfered with the wires, but local residents knew the value of trees in Western Kansas would not allow them to be cut, and the telephone poles were set down the center of the street. The first long-distance telephone service from Garden City was a line nine miles (14&nbsp;km) long, built in 1919.\n\n===Late 20th-century revival and ethnic diversification===\nIn the 1970s, Garden City decided (after some debate) to allow a meatpacking plant to be built there. This helped to invigorate the economy, which continued into the 21st century. Many new residents arrived, but even with population growth the unemployment rate was only about 3% in 2017. Many of the new arrivals were immigrants from outside the United States (Burma, Somalia, Vietnam, and other places, particularly Mexico and Latin America), such that over 48% of the 2010 population was Hispanic,<ref name=\"FactFinder\"/> and less than 40% of the population was non-Hispanic white.

The second group of Vietnamese were less educated than the first, and they were more likely to be Buddhist as opposed to being Christian.

zoological park in western Kansas.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|History of Kansas}}\n\nIn February 1878, James R. Fulton, William D. Fulton and W.D.'s son, L.W. Fulton, arrived at the present site of Garden City.<ref name=\"http\">{{cite web | title = Garden City History | url =http://www.gardencity.net/info/history/garden/| format =English | accessdate =2009-03-13}}</ref>\n\nThe original townsite was laid out on the south half of section 18 by [[engineer]] Charles Van Trump. The land was a loose, [[sandy loam]] and covered with [[sagebrush]] and soap weeds, but there were no trees. Main Street ran directly north and south, dividing William D. and James R. Fulton's claims. As soon as they could get building material, they erected two frame houses. William D. Fulton building on his land, on the east side of Main Street, a house one story and a half high, with two rooms on the ground and two rooms above. This was called the Occidental Hotel. William D. Fulton was proprietor. No other houses were built in Garden City until November 1878, when James R. Fulton and L.T. Walker each put up a building. The Fultons tried to get others to settle here, but only a few came, and at the end of the first year there were only four buildings.<ref name=\"http\"/>\n\nFollowing a sustained [[drought]], [[irrigation]] arrived in Finney County in 1879, with completion of the \"Garden City Ditch\". The ditch helped to launch an agricultural boom in southwestern Kansas.<ref>Exhibit, Finney County Historical Museum, Garden City, Kansas</ref>\n\n===19th-century growth===\nCharles Jesse Jones, later known as \"Buffalo\" Jones, arrived in Garden City for an antelope hunt in January 1879. Before Jones returned home, the Fulton brothers procured his services to promote Garden City, and especially in trying to influence the [[Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railroad]] to put in a switch station. The railroad agreed to place its station at Garden City. In the spring of 1879, more people began arriving to homestead in the area. During the years of 1885-1887, a rush was made for Western Kansas, and a settler arrived for every quarter section. The [[United States Land Office]] also located at Garden City, and people went there to make filings on their land. Lawyers also arrived in Garden City. I.R. Holmes, the agent for the sale of lands of the ATSF, and Holmes' partner, A.C. McKeever, in 1885 sold thousands of acres of railroad and private land.<ref name=\"http\"/>\n\nThe streets of Garden City were crowded with horses, wagons, buggies and teams of oxen. Long lines of people stood out in the weather awaiting mail at the [[post office]], and there was always a crowd in front of the land office. During the height of the boom the town had nine lumber yards. Lumber was hauled in all directions to build up inland towns and to improve the nearby homesteads. Thirteen drug stores were in operation, and the town had two daily newspapers. Nearly everyone used kerosene lamps, and a few were placed on posts on Main Street. There was no city water works, so all depended on shallow wells, which were strongly alkaline. Passenger trains of two and three sections arrived daily, loaded with people, most of whom got off at Garden City.<ref name=\"http\"/>\n\nThe first issue of ''The Garden City Newspaper'' appeared April 3, 1879. Three months after the paper was established, the editor stated, \"There are now forty buildings in town.\" When the first telephone line was built, trees were growing on both sides of Main Street. These interfered with the wires, but local residents knew the value of trees in Western Kansas would not allow them to be cut, and the telephone poles were set down the center of the street. The first long-distance telephone service from Garden City was a line nine miles (14&nbsp;km) long, built in 1919.\n\n===Late 20th-century revival and ethnic diversification===\nIn the 1970s, Garden City decided (after some debate) to allow a meatpacking plant to be built there. This helped to invigorate the economy, which continued into the 21st century. Many new residents arrived, but even with population growth the unemployment rate was only about 3% in 2017. Many of the new arrivals were immigrants from outside the United States (Burma, Somalia, Vietnam, and other places, particularly Mexico and Latin America), such that over 48% of the 2010 population was Hispanic,<ref name=\"FactFinder\"/> and less than 40% of the population was non-Hispanic white. The integration of this large immigrant population into the community was generally harmonious and amicable.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2017/02/19/516016940/a-thriving-rural-towns-winning-formula-faces-new-threats-under-trump-administrat |title=A Thriving Rural Town's Winning Formula Faces New Threats Under Trump Administration [transcript] |author=Frank Morris |date=February 19, 2017 |work=Weekend Edition |publisher=National Public Radio |accessdate=February 21, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===2016 bombing plot===\nIn October 2016, Gavin Wright, Curtis Allen, and Patrick Stein were arrested by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] for plotting a bombing attack on a mosque and the housing complex where it resides in part of the town's [[Somalia|Somali]] community.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/12/a-militias-plot-to-bomb-somali-refugees-in-garden-city-ks.html|title=A Militia's Plot to Bomb Somali Refugees in a Kansas Town|last=Pressler|first=Jessica|date=12 December 2017|work=New York Magazine|access-date=2017-12-31|language=en}}</ref> The three men were charged in federal court with threatening to use weapons of mass destruction, namely explosives.<ref>{{cite web |title=Attack on Somalis in Kansas thwarted, feds say |url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/14/us/mosque-attack-thwarted-kansas/ |publisher=CNN |date=October 16, 2016 |accessdate=October 16, 2016 |first=Ralph |last=Ellis}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Terrorist plot by militia group in Kansas thwarted |url=http://www.kansas.com/news/state/article108279072.html |work=The Wichita Eagle |date=October 14, 2016 |accessdate=October 16, 2016 |first1=Tim |last1=Potter |first2=Amy Renee |last2=Leiker}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Alleged Garden City bombing plot revealed |url=http://www.gctelegram.com/news/local/alleged-garden-city-bombing-plot-revealed/article_4ab7fcfa-f5f8-5f71-ab7e-3a6d18ea34c4.html |work=The Garden City Telegram |date=October 14, 2016 |accessdate=October 16, 2016 |first=Jonathan |last=Shorman}}</ref> All three defendants were found guilty in April, 2018 and were sentenced to 25\u201330 years in prison.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/us/articles/2019-01-25/3-militia-members-face-sentencing-in-kansas-bomb-plot|title=Militia Members Get Decades in Prison in Kansas Bomb Plot|last=Hegeman|first=Roxana|date=25 January 2019|work=U.S. News & World Report|access-date=2019-04-21|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nGarden City is at {{Coord|37|58|31|N|100|51|51|W|type:city}} at an elevation of 2,838 feet (865 m).<ref name=\"GR3\" /><ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> Located in southwestern Kansas at the intersection of [[U.S. Route 50 in Kansas|U.S. Route 50]] and [[U.S. Route 83 in Kansas|U.S. Route 83]], Garden City is {{convert|192|mi|km}} west-northwest of [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]], {{convert|204|mi|km}} north-northeast of [[Amarillo, Texas|Amarillo]], and {{convert|255|mi|km}} southeast of [[Denver]].<ref name=KDOT/><ref>{{cite web | title = City Distance Tool | publisher = [[Geobytes]] | url = http://www.geobytes.com/citydistancetool.htm | accessdate = 2010-03-06}}</ref>\n\nThe city lies on the north side of the [[Arkansas River]] in the [[High Plains (United States)|High Plains]] region of the [[Great Plains]].<ref name=KDOT>{{cite web | title = 2003-2004 Official Transportation Map | publisher = [[Kansas Department of Transportation]] | year = 2003 | url = http://www.ksdot.org/burtransplan/maps/HistoricStateMaps/2003-04Mapside.pdf | accessdate = 2011-10-31}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|8.82|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, all land.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2012-07-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702145235/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archivedate=2012-07-02 }}</ref>\n\n===Climate===\nGarden City has a [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid steppe climate]] (K\u00f6ppen: ''BSk'') with hot, dry summers and cold, dry winters.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Peel | first1 = M.

The sole non-playable character, Buddy Dacote, bore the most similarities to the original game's eventual protagonist. \"Dacote\" is an acronym for \"Dies at conclusion of this episode\", and Buddy was supposed to be killed by a [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] at the end of the planned third episode. In the [[Doom (1993 video game)|finished product]], this nearly happens to the Marine in the final level of the first episode, but you continue your adventure in episode two.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hall |first=Tom |title=The Doom Bible |year=1992 |publisher=Doomworld (1998) |url=http://5years.doomworld.com/doombible/ |accessdate=June 25, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131130021931/http://5years.doomworld.com/doombible/ |archivedate=November 30, 2013 }}</ref> Later, when asked, Tom Hall and John Romero confirmed that the Doomguy is a descendant of [[B.J._Blazkowicz|B.J.Blazkowicz]]. <ref>{{cite web|website=ArsTechnica|title=id Software co-founders confirm that its biggest games\u2019 heroes are all related|year=2018|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/01/id-software-co-founders-confirm-that-its-biggest-games-heroes-are-all-related/|accessdate=March 22, 2020}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web|last=Hall|first=Tom|url=https://twitter.com/ThatTomHall/status/958352500431572992|year=2018|accessdate=March 22, 2020|title=Twitter-response about relation between Doomguy, Keen and B.J.Blazkowicz}}</ref>\n\n==Incarnations==\n=== Original series ===\nAfter being ordered to fire upon unarmed civilians, the Marine in Doom fatally punches his commanding officer and is transferred from Earth to Mars. He would go on to be the only survivor after battling on Phobos, Deimos and through Hell, ultimately teleporting to Earth where he discovers that Earth has been invaded by demons.\n\nOn the box art for the original ''Doom'', the Marine is portrayed as muscular, wearing green armor and a light grey space helmet that conceals his facial features. The Marine is firing a machine gun and fighting a Baron of Hell. This image, with the addition of a shotgun clutched in their left hand, is carried over to the introduction screen of ''Doom''. The player's in-game avatar, as seen in multiplayer mode and in the ending of ''[[Doom II: Hell on Earth]]'', is based on this depiction. In multiplayer mode, the character wears green, red, brown and indigo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamers.org/docs/FAQ/doomfaq/sect1.html#8-1-2|title=Official Doom FAQ |website=Gamers.org|accessdate=October 15, 2012}}</ref> The Marine's face is seen in the game's [[HUD (computer gaming)|HUD]], where it is shown as a Caucasian male with light brown hair, a [[buzz cut]], and blue eyes. The Marine appears without a helmet in the cover art of ''Doom II'' and in the ending to ''[[Official versions of Doom#The Ultimate Doom|The Ultimate Doom]]'' episode IV, \"Thy Flesh Consumed\".\n\nIn ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', ''Doom II'', and ''[[Final Doom]]'', the Marine expresses little emotion at the horror unfolding around him, maintaining a stern and alert glare, eyes constantly darting left and right. When he takes damage, the Marine's reaction is a mixture of pain and anger. The Marine grins upon picking up a new weapon, and the most emotional face is seen when the Marine suffers 20 [[hit points]] or more taken away during a single attack, showing a shocked face.\n\nHowever, whilst id Software chose a somewhat generic, male pictorial representation of the character for cosmetic as well as gameplay purposes (damage feedback, story transitions), the identity of the Doom Marine is meant to represent the player themselves and so these depictions should only be considered illustrative of the character and not a depiction of what the character looks like. Jon Romero has been quoted as stating, \"...the [''Doom''] marine ...it's supposed to be YOU [the player]\".<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nThe Marine in ''[[Doom 64]]'' is less muscular, with slightly modified green armor with black highlights, a black helmet with an antenna and a blue visor. In ''[[Wolfenstein RPG]]'', it is hinted that the Doom 64 Marine is a descendant of [[William \"B.J.\" Blazkowicz]], to whom the Marine's helmetless look in the original games bears a striking similarity. In a reference to the Marine's confrontation with the [[Cyberdemon]], when Blazkowicz defeats the \"Harbinger of Doom\", the creature states that he will return in the future to confront his descendants.\n\n===''Doom 3''===\nIn ''[[Doom 3]]'', the Marine's appearance is similar to that of his classic ''Doom'' incarnation as he wears green armor with exposed arms, but it is unlikely the character is meant to represent either the player or the original Doom Marine. The Doom 3 Marine's facial features are not concealed, his muscular build is less exaggerated, and he has black hair. The Marine had recently arrived on Mars and is the newest member of the Marine detachment sent to the planet; his past remains a mystery other than that he holds a rank of Corporal and was sent to replace one of the marines that have mysteriously disappeared. The game begins as Sergeant Kelly briefs him to track down a missing scientist, who warns him of the UAC dabbling into Hell just a moment before the demon invasion begins.\n\nDuring the game the player can interact with several characters, most of whom, like Sergeant Kelly, give the player some briefing regarding his mission. The player character remains silent throughout and is portrayed as tough and fearless in the game's cut scenes; generally only glaring at the demons he sees. When he discovers the towering Cyberdemon for the game's final battle, however, he steps back in fear.\n\n====''Doom 3: Resurrection of Evil''====\nIn ''[[Doom 3: Resurrection of Evil]]'', the protagonist is also a different Marine, remains nameless and silent as the other Marine protagonists. He is a [[combat engineer]] who is trained to operate a remote manipulation device known as the \"Ionized Plasma Levitator\" or \"Grabber\". He wears dark blue armor, has a shaved head, and appears to be older than his ''Doom 3'' counterpart, based on his heavily weathered facial features. This Marine is part of a detachment under the command of Dr. Elizabeth McNeil, sent to investigate the Mars UAC facility in the aftermath of the demon invasion. While investigating the ancient Martian ruins, the Marine finds and touches \"the Heart of Hell\" artifact, which released a wave of energy that disintegrated the rest of his squad and opened another portal to Hell underneath the UAC base. This Marine seems to be more of an [[anti-hero]], given that he appears to derive pleasure from using the artifact, which kills almost everyone at the base.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/r_doom3roe_pc|title=Doom III: Resurrection Of Evil|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===''Doom II RPG''===\nIn [[Doom II RPG]], the marine is one of three protagonists to choose from. His name is '''Stan Blazkowicz''', suggesting he is a descendant of [[Wolfenstein]] protagonist B.J. Blazkowicz.\n\n===''Doom'' (2016)===\nIn the [[Doom (2016 video game)|2016 ''Doom'']], the identity of the silent protagonist referred to by Hell's forces as the Doom Slayer is ambiguous. \n\nThere are several theories of his possible origins.\nOne origin states that he is the sole surviving member of an order of paladins known as the Night Sentinels, who were tasked with protecting their home and native deities, the Wraiths, from Hell. The Doom Slayer was considered particularly special, as the [[seraphim]] had given him the ability to grow more powerful from the destruction he caused. He has been wreaking murderous havoc on Hell in retribution for a transgression they made against him that is yet to be revealed.\n\nAnother possible origin, solicited in ''Quake Champions'', states that the protagonist is the same Doom Marine from prior games. Such a story might explain why the title character still carries around the foot of his dead pet rabbit, Daisy, as a reminder of what he lost and why he fights.\n\nAccording to the \"Slayer's Testaments\" in the 2016 game, the being known as the \"Doom Slayer\" has been tormenting Hell and its armies for an eternity, and once \"wore the crown of the Night Sentinels\" in the \"first age\". He was given an Argent energy-charged exomantle of controversial design known as the ''Praetor Suit'' by a rogue demon, who was reviled by his own kind as a traitor called ''The Wretch'' for aiding the Doom Slayer's bloody cause. Additionally, at some point the \"seraphim\" further enhanced the Slayer with superhuman strength and speed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/87ua6z/all_of_the_slayers_testaments_from_doom_2016/|title=r/copypasta - All of the Slayer's Testaments from Doom 2016|website=reddit}}</ref>\n\nContrary to previous incarnations, this version is more vaguely characterized: the Doom Slayer is never seen nor heard other than from the first person, and other than gameplay at the beginning of the game that shows him having a Caucasian skin color and the muscular masculine suit seen in the introduction, practically no details are revealed. However, the Doom Slayer's eyes and nose can be made out through the visor of his helmet on the game's box art, the 3D model viewer, and his ''[[Quake Champions]]'' appearance.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2016/05/27/the-deanbeat-doom-is-a-memorable-trip-back-into-shooting-hell/|title=''The DeanBeat'': ''Doom'' is a memorable trip back into shooting hell|first=Dean|last=Takahashi|publisher=[[VentureBeat]]|date=May 27, 2016|accessdate=June 4, 2016}}</ref> It has been also noted for its visibly irreverent tone conveyed by its hand gestures, [[fist bump]]ing a small Doomguy [[figurine]].<ref name=\"jimquisition\"/>\n\n====''Doom Pinball''====\nThe Doom Slayer, as he appeared in the 2016  ''Doom'', is present in ''[[Doom Pinball]]'', the virtual [[pinball]] adaptation of that game developed by [[Zen Studios]] as one of the three tables of the ''Bethesda Pinball'' pack, an add-on for ''[[Zen Pinball 2]]'', ''[[Pinball FX 2]]'' and ''[[Pinball FX 3]]''.  He is a 3D animated figure placed on the left side of the table that fights the leaders of demon waves on the opposite side of the table, which are also 3D figures, when the player encounters one.  The table's dot-matrix display also occasionally shows the face of the original Doomguy from the 1993 game.\n\n===''Doom Eternal''===\nThe Doom Slayer returns in ''[[Doom Eternal]]'', the 2020 sequel to the 2016 ''Doom'', in which he sets out to continue his war against the legions of Hell as they expand their presence into various realms in the universe, including Earth, [[Heaven]] and [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]]. In Doom Eternal, it is confirmed that the Doom Slayer is the Doom Marine from the original Doom games, having been brought to the world of Sentinel Prime and given unimaginable power by the servants of the Khan Maykr. Prior to the events of the previous ''Doom'', his rage for the demons becomes so great he stops speaking and only utters curses and gutteral screams, which the player can hear during combat gameplay.\n\nAs the story progresses, more of the Doom Marine's time spent as a Night Sentinel is revealed, including about how he was made one of their great warrior kings and of the betrayal his new people suffered at their own hands due to lies, deceit and misguided faith. On the ravaged Earth, alien to the hellwalker himself, his name is spoken in hushed whispers by the few surviving pockets of individuals left alive planetside.\n\nTo many amongst the ARC (Armored Response Coalition), he is often colloquialized as a fleeting myth passed around by lingering survivors being a one-man army who singlehandedly stands alone against the invading demons, while others amongst the now-corrupt UAC cult attempt to rebuff claims of his existence and prowess on the battlefield as superfluous rumors to demoralize the resistance and anyone left who hadn't yet been slaughtered by the hordes of Doom. From his personal headquarters, Doomguy receives radio wave broadcasts from ARC ground sanctions detailing his exploits as an unknown savior to mankind. Succeeding in his lone crusade against the demons where the latest in cutting-edge technologies devised by the Allied Nations could not, a great many amongst their scientists seemingly praise and worship the Slayer as a vengeful wargod who descended upon the broken world in Man's greatest hour of need.\n\nIt is decidedly vague on whether or not that the Slayer is relatively human anymore. While many of the analysts who've examined him from within and without his tomb determine he is human from various blood samples of the subject that were taken and studied, one such technician notices trace amounts of exotic material in his genetic makeup that makes him something else. This is confirmed in his final battle with the Khan Maykr, who admonishes him as a once-mortal man who dared to deny her people's way of life. His ascendance to a living force of nature stems from the empowerment given by a rogue Maykr known as Samur Maykr (or the Seraphim) in Doom 2016, who used his race's technology to vastly empower him.\n\n''Doom Eternal'' is more specific about its characterization relative to the previous episode: Doomguy is seen without helmet and in first person, and for the first time in the series' history, he also speaks, voiced in flashback by Matthew Waterson. He also follows the streak for irreverence: a room in his Doom Fortress is filled with [[comic book]]s, collectible [[figurine]]s<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/guides/2020/3/20/21177111/doom-eternal-secret-found-map-location-collectible-item-cheat-code-question-mark|title=Doom Eternal secrets, maps, and locations guide|first=Dave|last=Tach|date=March 20, 2020|website=Polygon}}</ref>, [[electric guitar|guitar]]s<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-eternal-features-a-guitar-made-of-flesh-and-b/1100-6472897/|title=Doom Eternal Features A Guitar Made Of Flesh And Bones}}</ref> and a [[gaming computer]].\n\n===Novels===\nIn the 1990s [[Doom novels|''Doom'' novels]], the main character is referred to as '''Flynn \"Fly\" Taggart'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/2011/01/15/crap-shoot-doom-the-novels/ |title=Crap Shoot: Doom - The Novels &#124; Crap Shoot, Features |publisher=PC Gamer |date=2011-01-15 |accessdate=2013-07-21}}</ref> For the ''Doom 3'' novels, the Marine's name is '''John Kane'''. His past is similar to that of the protagonist in the original ''Doom'', having been demoted after disobeying command to save some of his fellow marines. He is a combat veteran of wars raging on Earth for its remaining resources, including one between the United States and Russia. After arriving on Mars, he is resigned to his fate as a \"glorified security guard\".{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} While there he befriends fellow marines such as Maria Moraetes{{mdash}}a marine with a similar fate.\n\nDuring the Hellish invasion Kane is forced to take command of several of the surviving marines despite his stripped ranking. He battles the demons singlehandedly or with a few other marines. He is depicted as compassionate to his fellow survivors, working to save the child Theo, and to save the damned in Hell. After volunteering to enter Hell to retrieve the soul cube, Campbell is shown as very impressed by him. He and Maria start to feel romantic ties to each other. During the end of ''[[Doom 3: Maelstrom]]'', Kane's leg is blown off and he is admired as the \"man who saved Mars City\".\n\n===Film===\nIn the [[Doom (film)|film adaptation of ''Doom'']], '''John \"Reaper\" Grimm''' ([[Karl Urban]]) is the son of UAC scientists who were killed in an accident during the early excavation of a Martian dig site. Reaper abandoned his scientific heritage and joined the military to forget about this personal tragedy, eventually becoming a member of the elite Rapid Response Tactical Squad. Grimm, his commanding officer Sarge and the other members of the RRTS are dispatched to the UAC Mars facility to investigate the disappearance of several scientists, where they confront humans who have mutated into monsters after being injected with an artificial 24th chromosome. Near the end of the film, Grimm is fatally wounded and injected with the chromosome by his sister to save his life. Instead of becoming a monster, Grimm is granted superhuman strength, reflexes, and regenerative abilities. These new abilities allow him to single-handedly mow down a small horde of monsters and zombies. After killing the now-mutating Sarge, Grimm leaves the base with his nearly-unconscious sister in his arms.\n\n==Guest appearances==\nThe Marine's corpse appears in a secret area in ''[[Duke Nukem 3D]]''; they are seen halfway through their ''Classic Doom'' death animation clutching their throat and gurgling, surrounded by various Satanic iconography. Upon seeing them, [[Duke Nukem (character)|Duke Nukem]] says, \"That's one doomed space marine\".<ref>{{cite web | title=Duke Nukem 3D: Doom Guy | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXZxBKPdxxw | date=September 1, 2009 | access-date=March 26, 2020 | author=Blake Morris (uploader) | via=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>\n\nIn the Saturn version of ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'', the Marine briefly appears at the end of the bonus feature \"Dank & Scuz\".

This was included because [[Activision]], publisher of the ''Tony Hawk'' series and ''Doom 3'', wanted to promote the latter, which was still in development.\n\nIn ''[[Quake III Arena]]'', the Marine appears in three levels under the name \"Doom\". He is described as 6ft (1.83) tall and weighing 180&nbsp;lbs. (81.64&nbsp;kg), according to the character description from the game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://earthli.com/quake/warriors.php?character=Doom|title=Warriors - Doom > dur's Quake III Arena|publisher=Earthli|accessdate=October 26, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.earthli.com/quake/images/warriors/p_doom.jpg|title=Doom : Profile|publisher=Data.earthli.com|accessdate=October 26, 2013}}</ref> The character \"Phobos\" is also a Doom Marine, though his skin is darker and his armor is orange rather than green. The third Doom Marine in the game, a woman named \"Crash\", is mentioned as being Doom's training instructor before arriving at the Arena.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nIn ''[[Rage (video game)|Rage]]'', after the first cut scene, the player enters a dune buggy with a bobble head of the Marine on the dashboard. The Easter egg in the game's Gearhead vault level is the first room from the ''Doom'' game, where the player can pick up a Doom Marine bobblehead.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} \n\nThe Doom Slayer is a playable character in the game ''[[Quake Champions]]''.

He is a [[space marine]] dressed in green combat armor who rarely speaks onscreen.\n\nConsidered a symbolic and iconic protagonist and character, the original depiction of the Doom Marine does not have a defined personality and barely portrays a predefined character.

The sole non-playable character, Buddy Dacote, bore the most similarities to the original game's eventual protagonist. \"Dacote\" is an acronym for \"Dies at conclusion of this episode\", and Buddy was supposed to be killed by a [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] at the end of the planned third episode. In the [[Doom (1993 video game)|finished product]], this nearly happens to the Marine in the final level of the first episode, but you continue your adventure in episode two.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hall |first=Tom |title=The Doom Bible |year=1992 |publisher=Doomworld (1998) |url=http://5years.doomworld.com/doombible/ |accessdate=June 25, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131130021931/http://5years.doomworld.com/doombible/ |archivedate=November 30, 2013 }}</ref> Later, when asked, Tom Hall and John Romero confirmed that the Doomguy is a descendant of [[B.J._Blazkowicz|B.J.Blazkowicz]]. <ref>{{cite web|website=ArsTechnica|title=id Software co-founders confirm that its biggest games\u2019 heroes are all related|year=2018|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/01/id-software-co-founders-confirm-that-its-biggest-games-heroes-are-all-related/|accessdate=March 22, 2020}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web|last=Hall|first=Tom|url=https://twitter.com/ThatTomHall/status/958352500431572992|year=2018|accessdate=March 22, 2020|title=Twitter-response about relation between Doomguy, Keen and B.J.Blazkowicz}}</ref>\n\n==Incarnations==\n=== Original series ===\nAfter being ordered to fire upon unarmed civilians, the Marine in Doom fatally punches his commanding officer and is transferred from Earth to Mars. He would go on to be the only survivor after battling on Phobos, Deimos and through Hell, ultimately teleporting to Earth where he discovers that Earth has been invaded by demons.\n\nOn the box art for the original ''Doom'', the Marine is portrayed as muscular, wearing green armor and a light grey space helmet that conceals his facial features. The Marine is firing a machine gun and fighting a Baron of Hell. This image, with the addition of a shotgun clutched in their left hand, is carried over to the introduction screen of ''Doom''. The player's in-game avatar, as seen in multiplayer mode and in the ending of ''[[Doom II: Hell on Earth]]'', is based on this depiction. In multiplayer mode, the character wears green, red, brown and indigo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamers.org/docs/FAQ/doomfaq/sect1.html#8-1-2|title=Official Doom FAQ |website=Gamers.org|accessdate=October 15, 2012}}</ref> The Marine's face is seen in the game's [[HUD (computer gaming)|HUD]], where it is shown as a Caucasian male with light brown hair, a [[buzz cut]], and blue eyes. The Marine appears without a helmet in the cover art of ''Doom II'' and in the ending to ''[[Official versions of Doom#The Ultimate Doom|The Ultimate Doom]]'' episode IV, \"Thy Flesh Consumed\".\n\nIn ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', ''Doom II'', and ''[[Final Doom]]'', the Marine expresses little emotion at the horror unfolding around him, maintaining a stern and alert glare, eyes constantly darting left and right. When he takes damage, the Marine's reaction is a mixture of pain and anger. The Marine grins upon picking up a new weapon, and the most emotional face is seen when the Marine suffers 20 [[hit points]] or more taken away during a single attack, showing a shocked face.\n\nHowever, whilst id Software chose a somewhat generic, male pictorial representation of the character for cosmetic as well as gameplay purposes (damage feedback, story transitions), the identity of the Doom Marine is meant to represent the player themselves and so these depictions should only be considered illustrative of the character and not a depiction of what the character looks like. Jon Romero has been quoted as stating, \"...the [''Doom''] marine ...it's supposed to be YOU [the player]\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Romero |first=John |title=''Doom Marine's Name'' forum post at Planet Romero |year=2002 |url=http://rome.ro/smf/index.php/topic,1521.msg31827.html#msg31827 |accessdate=August 23, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024185346/http://rome.ro/smf/index.php/topic,1521.msg31827.html#msg31827 |archivedate=October 24, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe Marine in ''[[Doom 64]]'' is less muscular, with slightly modified green armor with black highlights, a black helmet with an antenna and a blue visor. In ''[[Wolfenstein RPG]]'', it is hinted that the Doom 64 Marine is a descendant of [[William \"B.J.\" Blazkowicz]], to whom the Marine's helmetless look in the original games bears a striking similarity. In a reference to the Marine's confrontation with the [[Cyberdemon]], when Blazkowicz defeats the \"Harbinger of Doom\", the creature states that he will return in the future to confront his descendants.\n\n===''Doom 3''===\nIn ''[[Doom 3]]'', the Marine's appearance is similar to that of his classic ''Doom'' incarnation as he wears green armor with exposed arms, but it is unlikely the character is meant to represent either the player or the original Doom Marine. The Doom 3 Marine's facial features are not concealed, his muscular build is less exaggerated, and he has black hair. The Marine had recently arrived on Mars and is the newest member of the Marine detachment sent to the planet; his past remains a mystery other than that he holds a rank of Corporal and was sent to replace one of the marines that have mysteriously disappeared. The game begins as Sergeant Kelly briefs him to track down a missing scientist, who warns him of the UAC dabbling into Hell just a moment before the demon invasion begins.\n\nDuring the game the player can interact with several characters, most of whom, like Sergeant Kelly, give the player some briefing regarding his mission. The player character remains silent throughout and is portrayed as tough and fearless in the game's cut scenes; generally only glaring at the demons he sees. When he discovers the towering Cyberdemon for the game's final battle, however, he steps back in fear.\n\n====''Doom 3: Resurrection of Evil''====\nIn ''[[Doom 3: Resurrection of Evil]]'', the protagonist is also a different Marine, remains nameless and silent as the other Marine protagonists. He is a [[combat engineer]] who is trained to operate a remote manipulation device known as the \"Ionized Plasma Levitator\" or \"Grabber\". He wears dark blue armor, has a shaved head, and appears to be older than his ''Doom 3'' counterpart, based on his heavily weathered facial features. This Marine is part of a detachment under the command of Dr. Elizabeth McNeil, sent to investigate the Mars UAC facility in the aftermath of the demon invasion. While investigating the ancient Martian ruins, the Marine finds and touches \"the Heart of Hell\" artifact, which released a wave of energy that disintegrated the rest of his squad and opened another portal to Hell underneath the UAC base. This Marine seems to be more of an [[anti-hero]], given that he appears to derive pleasure from using the artifact, which kills almost everyone at the base.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/r_doom3roe_pc|title=Doom III: Resurrection Of Evil|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===''Doom II RPG''===\nIn [[Doom II RPG]], the marine is one of three protagonists to choose from. His name is '''Stan Blazkowicz''', suggesting he is a descendant of [[Wolfenstein]] protagonist B.J. Blazkowicz.\n\n===''Doom'' (2016)===\nIn the [[Doom (2016 video game)|2016 ''Doom'']], the identity of the silent protagonist referred to by Hell's forces as the Doom Slayer is ambiguous. \n\nThere are several theories of his possible origins.\nOne origin states that he is the sole surviving member of an order of paladins known as the Night Sentinels, who were tasked with protecting their home and native deities, the Wraiths, from Hell. The Doom Slayer was considered particularly special, as the [[seraphim]] had given him the ability to grow more powerful from the destruction he caused. He has been wreaking murderous havoc on Hell in retribution for a transgression they made against him that is yet to be revealed.\n\nAnother possible origin, solicited in ''Quake Champions'', states that the protagonist is the same Doom Marine from prior games. Such a story might explain why the title character still carries around the foot of his dead pet rabbit, Daisy, as a reminder of what he lost and why he fights.\n\nAccording to the \"Slayer's Testaments\" in the 2016 game, the being known as the \"Doom Slayer\" has been tormenting Hell and its armies for an eternity, and once \"wore the crown of the Night Sentinels\" in the \"first age\". He was given an Argent energy-charged exomantle of controversial design known as the ''Praetor Suit'' by a rogue demon, who was reviled by his own kind as a traitor called ''The Wretch'' for aiding the Doom Slayer's bloody cause. Additionally, at some point the \"seraphim\" further enhanced the Slayer with superhuman strength and speed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/87ua6z/all_of_the_slayers_testaments_from_doom_2016/}}</ref>\n\nContrary to previous incarnations, this version is more vaguely characterized: the Doom Slayer is never seen nor heard other than from the first person, and other than gameplay at the beginning of the game that shows him having a Caucasian skin color and the muscular masculine suit seen in the introduction, practically no details are revealed. However, the Doom Slayer's eyes and nose can be made out through the visor of his helmet on the game's box art, the 3D model viewer, and his ''[[Quake Champions]]'' appearance.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2016/05/27/the-deanbeat-doom-is-a-memorable-trip-back-into-shooting-hell/|title=''The DeanBeat'': ''Doom'' is a memorable trip back into shooting hell|first=Dean|last=Takahashi|publisher=[[VentureBeat]]|date=May 27, 2016|accessdate=June 4, 2016}}</ref> It has been also noted for its visibly irreverent tone conveyed by its hand gestures, [[fist bump]]ing a small Doomguy [[figurine]].<ref name=\"jimquisition\"/>\n\n====''Doom Pinball''====\nThe Doom Slayer, as he appeared in the 2016  ''Doom'', is present in ''[[Doom Pinball]]'', the virtual [[pinball]] adaptation of that game developed by [[Zen Studios]] as one of the three tables of the ''Bethesda Pinball'' pack, an add-on for ''[[Zen Pinball 2]]'', ''[[Pinball FX 2]]'' and ''[[Pinball FX 3]]''.  He is a 3D animated figure placed on the left side of the table that fights the leaders of demon waves on the opposite side of the table, which are also 3D figures, when the player encounters one.  The table's dot-matrix display also occasionally shows the face of the original Doomguy from the 1993 game.\n\n===''Doom Eternal''===\nThe Doom Slayer returns in ''[[Doom Eternal]]'', the 2020 sequel to the 2016 ''Doom'', in which he sets out to continue his war against the legions of Hell as they expand their presence into various realms in the universe, including Earth, [[Heaven]] and [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]]. In Doom Eternal, it is confirmed that the Doom Slayer is the Doom Marine from the original Doom games, having been brought to the world of Sentinel Prime and given unimaginable power by the servants of the Khan Maykr. Prior to the events of the previous ''Doom'', his rage for the demons becomes so great he stops speaking and only utters curses and gutteral screams, which the player can hear during combat gameplay.\n\nAs the story progresses, more of the Doom Marine's time spent as a Night Sentinel is revealed, including about how he was made one of their great warrior kings and of the betrayal his new people suffered at their own hands due to lies, deceit and misguided faith. On the ravaged Earth, alien to the hellwalker himself, his name is spoken in hushed whispers by the few surviving pockets of individuals left alive planetside.\n\nTo many amongst the ARC (Armored Response Coalition), he is often colloquialized as a fleeting myth passed around by lingering survivors being a one-man army who singlehandedly stands alone against the invading demons, while others amongst the now-corrupt UAC cult attempt to rebuff claims of his existence and prowess on the battlefield as superfluous rumors to demoralize the resistance and anyone left who hadn't yet been slaughtered by the hordes of Doom. From his personal headquarters, Doomguy receives radio wave broadcasts from ARC ground sanctions detailing his exploits as an unknown savior to mankind. Succeeding in his lone crusade against the demons where the latest in cutting-edge technologies devised by the Allied Nations could not, a great many amongst their scientists seemingly praise and worship the Slayer as a vengeful wargod who descended upon the broken world in Man's greatest hour of need.\n\nIt is decidedly vague on whether or not that the Slayer is relatively human anymore. While many of the analysts who've examined him from within and without his tomb determine he is human from various blood samples of the subject that were taken and studied, one such technician notices trace amounts of exotic material in his genetic makeup that makes him something else. This is confirmed in his final battle with the Khan Maykr, who admonishes him as a once-mortal man who dared to deny her people's way of life. His ascendance to a living force of nature stems from the empowerment given by a rogue Maykr known as Samur Maykr (or the Seraphim) in Doom 2016, who used his race's technology to vastly empower him.\n\n''Doom Eternal'' is more specific about its characterization relative to the previous episode: Doomguy is seen without helmet and in first person, and for the first time in the series' history, he also speaks, voiced in flashback by Matthew Waterson. He also follows the streak for irreverence: a room in his Doom Fortress is filled with [[comic book]]s, collectible [[figurine]]s<ref>https://www.polygon.com/guides/2020/3/20/21177111/doom-eternal-secret-found-map-location-collectible-item-cheat-code-question-mark</ref>, [[electric guitar|guitar]]s<ref>https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-eternal-features-a-guitar-made-of-flesh-and-b/1100-6472897/</ref> and a [[gaming computer]].\n\n===Novels===\nIn the 1990s [[Doom novels|''Doom'' novels]], the main character is referred to as '''Flynn \"Fly\" Taggart'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/2011/01/15/crap-shoot-doom-the-novels/ |title=Crap Shoot: Doom - The Novels &#124; Crap Shoot, Features |publisher=PC Gamer |date=2011-01-15 |accessdate=2013-07-21}}</ref> For the ''Doom 3'' novels, the Marine's name is '''John Kane'''. His past is similar to that of the protagonist in the original ''Doom'', having been demoted after disobeying command to save some of his fellow marines. He is a combat veteran of wars raging on Earth for its remaining resources, including one between the United States and Russia. After arriving on Mars, he is resigned to his fate as a \"glorified security guard\".{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} While there he befriends fellow marines such as Maria Moraetes{{mdash}}a marine with a similar fate.\n\nDuring the Hellish invasion Kane is forced to take command of several of the surviving marines despite his stripped ranking. He battles the demons singlehandedly or with a few other marines. He is depicted as compassionate to his fellow survivors, working to save the child Theo, and to save the damned in Hell. After volunteering to enter Hell to retrieve the soul cube, Campbell is shown as very impressed by him. He and Maria start to feel romantic ties to each other. During the end of ''[[Doom 3: Maelstrom]]'', Kane's leg is blown off and he is admired as the \"man who saved Mars City\".\n\n===Film===\nIn the [[Doom (film)|film adaptation of ''Doom'']], '''John \"Reaper\" Grimm''' ([[Karl Urban]]) is the son of UAC scientists who were killed in an accident during the early excavation of a Martian dig site. Reaper abandoned his scientific heritage and joined the military to forget about this personal tragedy, eventually becoming a member of the elite Rapid Response Tactical Squad. Grimm, his commanding officer Sarge and the other members of the RRTS are dispatched to the UAC Mars facility to investigate the disappearance of several scientists, where they confront humans who have mutated into monsters after being injected with an artificial 24th chromosome. Near the end of the film, Grimm is fatally wounded and injected with the chromosome by his sister to save his life. Instead of becoming a monster, Grimm is granted superhuman strength, reflexes, and regenerative abilities. These new abilities allow him to single-handedly mow down a small horde of monsters and zombies. After killing the now-mutating Sarge, Grimm leaves the base with his nearly-unconscious sister in his arms.\n\n==Guest appearances==\nThe Marine's corpse appears in a secret area in ''[[Duke Nukem 3D]]''; they are seen halfway through their ''Classic Doom'' death animation clutching their throat and gurgling, surrounded by various Satanic iconography. Upon seeing them, [[Duke Nukem (character)|Duke Nukem]] says, \"That's one doomed space marine\".<ref>{{cite web | title=Duke Nukem 3D: Doom Guy | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXZxBKPdxxw | date=September 1, 2009 | access-date=March 26, 2020 | author=Blake Morris (uploader) | via=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>\n\nIn the Saturn version of ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'', the Marine briefly appears at the end of the bonus feature \"Dank & Scuz\".

This was included because [[Activision]], publisher of the ''Tony Hawk'' series and ''Doom 3'', wanted to promote the latter, which was still in development.\n\nIn ''[[Quake III Arena]]'', the Marine appears in three levels under the name \"Doom\". He is described as 6ft (1.83) tall and weighing 180&nbsp;lbs. (81.64&nbsp;kg), according to the character description from the game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://earthli.com/quake/warriors.php?character=Doom|title=Warriors - Doom > dur's Quake III Arena|publisher=Earthli|accessdate=October 26, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.earthli.com/quake/images/warriors/p_doom.jpg|title=Doom : Profile|publisher=Data.earthli.com|accessdate=October 26, 2013}}</ref> The character \"Phobos\" is also a Doom Marine, though his skin is darker and his armor is orange rather than green.

However, the extent of its actual independence from the Kingdom of Ani is uncertain: it was always in the possession of the relatives of the rulers of Ani, and, after Ani's capture by the [[Byzantine Empire]] in 1045, the Bagratuni title \"King of Kings\" held by the ruler of Ani was transferred to the ruler of Kars. In 1064, just after the capture of Ani by [[Alp Arslan]] (leader of the [[Seljuk Turks]]), the Armenian king of Kars, Gagik-Abas, paid homage to the victorious Turks so that they would not lay siege to his city. In 1065 Gagik-Abas ceded his kingdom to the Byzantine Empire, but soon after Kars was taken by the Seljuk Turks.<ref name=\"SAE\"/>\n\nThe Seljuks quickly relinquished direct control over Kars and it became a small emirate whose territory corresponded closely to that of Vanand, and which bordered the similarly created but larger Shaddadid emirate centered at Ani. The Kars emirate was a vassal of the [[Saltukids]] in Erzurum, whose forces were effective in opposing [[Kingdom of Georgia|Georgian]] attempts at seizing Kars. Thus, it was only in 1206 that Zakare of the [[Zakarids-Mkhargrzeli]] succeeded in capturing Kars, joining it to their fiefdom of Ani.<ref>{{harvnb|Lordkipanidze|Hewitt|1987|p=135}}.</ref> It was conquered in 1242 by the [[Mongols]]; was regained by Georgian Kingdom during the reign of [[George V of Georgia|George V the Brilliant]] (1314\u20131346), it remained part of the Kingdom before its disintegration, which then passed into the hands of [[Samtskhe-Saatabago|Georgian Atabegs]] belonging to the [[Jaqeli|House of Jaqeli]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} In 1387 the city surrendered to [[Timur]] (Tamerlane) and its fortifications were damaged.

The treaty allowed for Soviet annexation of [[Adjara]] in exchange for Turkish control of the regions of [[Kars Province|Kars]], [[I\u011fd\u0131r Province|Igdir]], and [[Ardahan Province|Ardahan]]. The Treaty of Kars established peaceful relations between the two nations, but as early as 1939, some British diplomats noted{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} indications that the Soviet Union was not satisfied with the established border.The [[Treaty of Kars]], signed in 1921 by the [[Government of the Grand National Assembly]] and by the Soviet republics of [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic|Azerbaijan]] and [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic|Georgia]], established the current north-eastern boundaries of Turkey. The treaty included ''de jure'' provisions guaranteeing the Armenian residents right to relinquish Turkish nationality, leave the territory freely and take with them either their goods or the proceeds of their sale, but by some accounts formerly Armenian lands had ''de facto'' become state property as a consequence of the treaty.<ref>{{cite book|last=Morack|first=Ellinor|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UU5cDgAAQBAJ|title=The Dowry of the State?: The Politics of Abandoned Property and the Population Exchange in Turkey 1921-1945|date=2017-03-14|publisher=University if Bamberg Press|isbn=9783863094638|p=167}}</ref>\n\n===After World War II===\nAfter World War II, the Soviet Union attempted to annul the Kars treaty and regain the Kars region and the adjoining region of [[Ardahan]]. On June 7, 1945, Soviet Foreign Minister [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] told the Turkish ambassador to Moscow [[Selim Sarper]] that the regions should be returned to the [[Soviet Union]], on behalf of the Georgian and Armenian republics.  Turkey found itself in a difficult position: it wanted good relations with the Soviet Union, but at the same time they refused to give up the territories. Turkey itself was in no condition to fight a war with the Soviet Union, which had emerged as a superpower after the second world war. By the autumn of 1945, Soviet troops in the Caucasus were ordered to prepare for a possible invasion of Turkey. Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] objected to these territorial claims, while [[President of the United States|President]] [[Harry Truman]] initially felt that the matter should not concern other parties. With the onset of the [[Cold War]], however, the United States came to see Turkey as a useful ally against Soviet expansion and began to support it financially and militarily. By 1948 the Soviet Union dropped its claims to Kars and the other regions.<ref>Krikorian, Robert O.

Summers are generally brief and warm with cool nights. The average high temperature in August is {{convert|26|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|lk=on|abbr=on}}. Winters are very cold. The average low January temperature is {{convert|-16|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|lk=on|abbr=on}}. However, temperatures can plummet to {{convert|-35|C|1}} during the winter months. It snows a lot in winter, staying for an average of four months in the city. Due to its geographic location of the city in the province, it has a slightly milder climate compared to the surrounding region.

Kars is served by [[Kars Railway Station|a station]] on the [[Turkish Railways]] (TCDD) that links it to Erzurum. This line was originally laid when Kars was within the Russian Empire and connected the city to nearby [[Gyumri|Alexandropol]] and [[Tiflis]], with a wartime, narrow-gauge extension running to Erzurum. Turkey's border crossings with Armenia, including the rail link, the [[Kars-Gyumri-Tbilisi railway]], have regrettably been closed since April 1993. Turkey's border with [[Armenia]] was closed down after the Armenia occupied the Nagorno Karabakh region in Azerbaijan.

Its walls date back to the [[Bagratuni Dynasty|Bagratuni]] Armenian period (there is surviving masonry on the north side of the castle) but it probably took on its present form during the thirteenth century when Kars was ruled by the [[Zak'arid]] dynasty.\n\nThe walls bear crosses in several places, including a  [[khachkar]] with a building inscription in Armenian on the easternmost tower, so the much repeated statement that Kars castle was built by [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Sultan]] [[Murad III]] during the war with [[Persian Empire|Persia]], at the close of the sixteenth century, is inaccurate. However, Murad probably did reconstruct much of the city walls (they are similar to those that the Ottoman army constructed at [[Ardahan]]). During the eighteenth century at the [[Battle of Kars (1745)]] a crushing defeat was inflicted upon the Ottoman army by the Persian conqueror, Nader Shah, not far from the city of Kars.\n\nBy the nineteenth century the citadel had lost most of its defensive purpose and a series of outer fortresses and defensive works were constructed to encircle Kars &ndash; this new defensive system proved particularly notable during the [[Siege of Kars]] in 1855.\n\n=== Other historical structures ===\n[[File:20110419 Tas Kopru bridge Kars Turkey Panorama.jpg|thumb|left|\"Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fc\" (Stone Bridge 1725) over the Kars river.]]\n[[File:Kars Church Of The Apostles 2009.JPG|thumb|right|The Armenian [[Cathedral of Kars|Church of the Apostles]] housed a museum in the 1960s\u201370s and was converted to a mosque in 1993.<ref>{{cite news|title=Buras\u0131 cami oldu, burada ayin olmaz|url=http://www.milliyet.com.tr/d/t.aspx?ID=879898|newspaper=Milliyet|date=2008-06-24|language=Turkish|quote=Vak\u0131flar Genel M\u00fcd\u00fcrl\u00fc\u011f\u00fc, 1993 y\u0131l\u0131nda kiliseyi Diyanet \u0130\u015fleri Ba\u015fkanl\u0131\u011f\u0131'na devretti.

Built in the 930s, it has a [[tetraconch]] plan (a square with four semicircular apses) surmounted by a spherical dome on a cylindrical drum. On the exterior, the drum of contains [[bas-relief]] depictions of twelve figures, usually interpreted as representing the Twelve Apostles. The dome has a conical roof. The church was converted to a mosque in 1579, and then converted into a Russian Orthodox church in the 1880s. The Russian people constructed porches in front of the church's 3 entrances, and an elaborate belltower (now demolished) next to the church. The church was used as a warehouse from the 1930s, and it housed a small museum from 1963 until the late 1970s. Then the building was left to itself for about two decades, until it was converted into a mosque in 1993. In the same district of Kars are two other ruined Armenian churches. A Russian church from the 1900s was converted to a mosque in the 1980s after serving as a school gymnasium.<ref>\"[http://www.virtualani.org/karscathedral/index.htm THE CATHEDRAL OF KARS: Holy Apostles Church (Surb Arak'elots)].\" VirtualANI.

Most Russian-era buildings in Kars are identical in architectural style to those of Gyumri in Armenia.  [[Orhan Pamuk]] in the novel ''[[Snow (Pamuk novel)|Snow]]'', set in Kars, makes repeated references to \"the Russian houses\", built \"in a [[Balts|Baltic]] style\", whose like cannot be seen

However, the extent of its actual independence from the Kingdom of Ani is uncertain: it was always in the possession of the relatives of the rulers of Ani, and, after Ani's capture by the [[Byzantine Empire]] in 1045, the Bagratuni title \"King of Kings\" held by the ruler of Ani was transferred to the ruler of Kars. In 1064, just after the capture of Ani by [[Alp Arslan]] (leader of the [[Seljuk Turks]]), the Armenian king of Kars, Gagik-Abas, paid homage to the victorious Turks so that they would not lay siege to his city. In 1065 Gagik-Abas ceded his kingdom to the Byzantine Empire, but soon after Kars was taken by the Seljuk Turks.<ref name=\"SAE\"/>\n\nThe Seljuks quickly relinquished direct control over Kars and it became a small emirate whose territory corresponded closely to that of Vanand, and which bordered the similarly created but larger Shaddadid emirate centered at Ani. The Kars emirate was a vassal of the [[Saltukids]] in Erzurum, whose forces were effective in opposing [[Kingdom of Georgia|Georgian]] attempts at seizing Kars. Thus, it was only in 1206 that Zakare of the [[Zakarids-Mkhargrzeli]] succeeded in capturing Kars, joining it to their fiefdom of Ani.<ref>{{harvnb|Lordkipanidze|Hewitt|1987|p=135}}.</ref> It was conquered in 1242 by the [[Mongols]]; was regained by Georgian Kingdom during the reign of [[George V of Georgia|George V the Brilliant]] (1314\u20131346), it remained part of the Kingdom before its disintegration, which then passed into the hands of [[Samtskhe-Saatabago|Georgian Atabegs]] belonging to the [[Jaqeli|House of Jaqeli]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} In 1387 the city surrendered to [[Timur]] (Tamerlane) and its fortifications were damaged.

On June 7, 1945, Soviet Foreign Minister [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] told the Turkish ambassador to Moscow [[Selim Sarper]] that the regions should be returned to the [[Soviet Union]], on behalf of the Georgian and Armenian republics.  Turkey found itself in a difficult position: it wanted good relations with the Soviet Union, but at the same time they refused to give up the territories. Turkey itself was in no condition to fight a war with the Soviet Union, which had emerged as a superpower after the second world war. By the autumn of 1945, Soviet troops in the Caucasus were ordered to prepare for a possible invasion of Turkey. Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] objected to these territorial claims, while [[President of the United States|President]] [[Harry Truman]] initially felt that the matter should not concern other parties. With the onset of the [[Cold War]], however, the United States came to see Turkey as a useful ally against Soviet expansion and began to support it financially and militarily.

Summers are generally brief and warm with cool nights. The average high temperature in August is {{convert|26|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|lk=on|abbr=on}}. Winters are very cold. The average low January temperature is {{convert|-16|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|lk=on|abbr=on}}. However, temperatures can plummet to {{convert|-35|C|1}} during the winter months. It snows a lot in winter, staying for an average of four months in the city. Due to its geographic location of the city in the province, it has a slightly milder climate compared to the surrounding region. Some hills and peaks in the province, especially around the [[Sar\u0131kam\u0131\u015f]] region, are [[subarctic]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Dfc'') due to the higher elevation of the region.

Its walls date back to the [[Bagratuni Dynasty|Bagratuni]] Armenian period (there is surviving masonry on the north side of the castle) but it probably took on its present form during the thirteenth century when Kars was ruled by the [[Zak'arid]] dynasty.\n\nThe walls bear crosses in several places, including a  [[khachkar]] with a building inscription in Armenian on the easternmost tower, so the much repeated statement that Kars castle was built by [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Sultan]] [[Murad III]] during the war with [[Persian Empire|Persia]], at the close of the sixteenth century, is inaccurate. However, Murad probably did reconstruct much of the city walls (they are similar to those that the Ottoman army constructed at [[Ardahan]]). During the eighteenth century at the [[Battle of Kars (1745)]] a crushing defeat was inflicted upon the Ottoman army by the Persian conqueror, Nader Shah, not far from the city of Kars.\n\nBy the nineteenth century the citadel had lost most of its defensive purpose and a series of outer fortresses and defensive works were constructed to encircle Kars &ndash; this new defensive system proved particularly notable during the [[Siege of Kars]] in 1855.\n\n=== Other historical structures ===\n[[File:20110419 Tas Kopru bridge Kars Turkey Panorama.jpg|thumb|left|\"Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fc\" (Stone Bridge 1725) over the Kars river.]]\n[[File:Kars Church Of The Apostles 2009.JPG|thumb|right|The Armenian [[Cathedral of Kars|Church of the Apostles]] housed a museum in the 1960s\u201370s and was converted to a mosque in 1993.<ref>{{cite news|title=Buras\u0131 cami oldu, burada ayin olmaz|url=http://www.milliyet.com.tr/d/t.aspx?ID=879898|newspaper=Milliyet|date=2008-06-24|language=Turkish|quote=Vak\u0131flar Genel M\u00fcd\u00fcrl\u00fc\u011f\u00fc, 1993 y\u0131l\u0131nda kiliseyi Diyanet \u0130\u015fleri Ba\u015fkanl\u0131\u011f\u0131'na devretti.

Built in the 930s, it has a [[tetraconch]] plan (a square with four semicircular apses) surmounted by a spherical dome on a cylindrical drum. On the exterior, the drum of contains [[bas-relief]] depictions of twelve figures, usually interpreted as representing the Twelve Apostles. The dome has a conical roof. The church was converted to a mosque in 1579, and then converted into a Russian Orthodox church in the 1880s. The Russian people constructed porches in front of the church's 3 entrances, and an elaborate belltower (now demolished) next to the church. The church was used as a warehouse from the 1930s, and it housed a small museum from 1963 until the late 1970s.

It is a solution of the Davydov [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]]. It is named for the Soviet and Ukrainian physicist [[Alexander Davydov]]. The Davydov model describes the interaction of the amide I [[vibration]]s with the [[hydrogen bond]]s that stabilize the [[\u03b1-helix]] of [[protein]]s. The elementary excitations within the \u03b1-helix are given by the [[phonon]]s which correspond to the deformational oscillations of the lattice, and the [[exciton]]s which describe the internal [[amide|amide I]] excitations of the [[peptide group]]s. Referring to the atomic structure of an \u03b1-helix region of protein the mechanism that creates the Davydov soliton ([[polaron]], [[exciton]]) can be described as follows: [[vibration]]al [[energy]] of the [[carbonyl|C=O]] [[stretching]] (or [[amide|amide I]]) [[oscillator]]s that is localized on the \u03b1-helix acts through a phonon coupling effect to distort the structure of the \u03b1-helix, while the helical distortion reacts again through phonon coupling to trap the amide I oscillation energy and prevent its dispersion. This effect is called ''self-localization'' or ''self-trapping''.<ref name=\"Davydov1973\">{{cite journal\n | last1 = Davydov\n | first1 = Alexander S.\n | title = The theory of contraction of proteins under their excitation\n | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology\n | volume = 38\n | pages = 559\u2013569\n | year = 1973\n | doi = 10.1016/0022-5193(73)90256-7\n | pmid = 4266326\n | issue = 3\n}}</ref><ref name=\"Davydov1977\">\n{{cite journal\n | last1 = Davydov\n | first1 = Alexander S.\n | title = Solitons and energy transfer along protein molecules\n | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology\n | volume = 66\n | pages = 379\u2013387\n | year = 1977\n | doi = 10.1016/0022-5193(77)90178-3\n | pmid = 886872\n | issue = 2\n}}</ref><ref name=\"Davydov1979\">{{cite journal\n | last1 = Davydov\n | first1 = Alexander S.\n | title = Solitons, bioenergetics, and the mechanism of muscle contraction\n | journal = International Journal of Quantum Chemistry\n | volume = 16\n | issue = 1\n | pages = 5\u201317\n | year = 1979\n | doi = 10.1002/qua.560160104\n}}</ref> [[Soliton]]s in which the [[energy]] is distributed in a fashion preserving the [[helix|helical]] [[symmetry]] are dynamically unstable, and such [[symmetric]]al solitons once formed decay rapidly when they propagate.

It is a solution of the Davydov [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]]. It is named for the Soviet and Ukrainian physicist [[Alexander Davydov]]. The Davydov model describes the interaction of the amide I [[vibration]]s with the [[hydrogen bond]]s that stabilize the [[\u03b1-helix]] of [[protein]]s. The elementary excitations within the \u03b1-helix are given by the [[phonon]]s which correspond to the deformational oscillations of the lattice, and the [[exciton]]s which describe the internal [[amide|amide I]] excitations of the [[peptide group]]s. Referring to the atomic structure of an \u03b1-helix region of protein the mechanism that creates the Davydov soliton ([[polaron]], [[exciton]]) can be described as follows: [[vibration]]al [[energy]] of the [[carbonyl|C=O]] [[stretching]] (or [[amide|amide I]]) [[oscillator]]s that is localized on the \u03b1-helix acts through a phonon coupling effect to distort the structure of the \u03b1-helix, while the helical distortion reacts again through phonon coupling to trap the amide I oscillation energy and prevent its dispersion. This effect is called ''self-localization'' or ''self-trapping''.<ref name=\"Davydov1973\">{{cite journal\n | last1 = Davydov\n | first1 = Alexander S.\n | title = The theory of contraction of proteins under their excitation\n | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology\n | volume = 38\n | pages = 559\u2013569\n | year = 1973\n | doi = 10.1016/0022-5193(73)90256-7\n | pmid = 4266326\n | issue = 3\n}}</ref><ref name=\"Davydov1977\">\n{{cite journal\n | last1 = Davydov\n | first1 = Alexander S.\n | title = Solitons and energy transfer along protein molecules\n | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology\n | volume = 66\n | pages = 379\u2013387\n | year = 1977\n | doi = 10.1016/0022-5193(77)90178-3\n | pmid = 886872\n | issue = 2\n}}</ref><ref name=\"Davydov1979\">{{cite journal\n | last1 = Davydov\n | first1 = Alexander S.\n | title = Solitons, bioenergetics, and the mechanism of muscle contraction\n | journal = International Journal of Quantum Chemistry\n | volume = 16\n | issue = 1\n | pages = 5\u201317\n | year = 1979\n | doi = 10.1002/qua.560160104\n}}</ref> [[Soliton]]s in which the [[energy]] is distributed in a fashion preserving the [[helix|helical]] [[symmetry]] are dynamically unstable, and such [[symmetric]]al solitons once formed decay rapidly when they propagate.

In 1961 the School of Health Sciences and its divisions of Nursing, Medical Technology, Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation and Nutrition were opened, all centered on the Institute of Child Health.\n\nOn June 15, 1963, Hacettepe University, Faculty of Medicine was established and a general teaching hospital was built. Three months later Hacettepe University School of Dentistry was established.\n\nIn the summer of 1964, a School of Basic Sciences was opened, offering courses in the natural sciences, social sciences and the humanities. At the time, all Hacettepe teaching institutions were affiliated to Ankara University and grouped under the title \"Hacettepe Science Center\".\n\nHacettepe University was chartered through Act No. 892 of the Turkish Parliament on July 8, 1967. Hacettepe Institutes of Higher Education formed the core of Hacettepe University, and the Faculties of Medicine, Science and Engineering, and Social and Administrative sciences were established.\n\nIn 1969 Hacettepe School of Pharmacy and Health Administration were established. In 1971 with a reorganization, the former schools were given faculty status and thus they became the Faculty of Dentistry, Faculty of Engineering, Faculty of Pharmacy and Faculty of Science. In 1973 the School of Technology was established. In I982 the former faculties were reorganized as the Faculty of Letters, Faculty of Education, Faculty of Fine Arts, Faculty of Economic and Administrative Sciences and the State Conservatory was affiliated to Hacettepe University. In 1984 the School of Health services and in 1989 the School of Sport Sciences and Technology were established. Recently in 1998 the two Polatli; Vocational Schools and Kaman Vocational School have been established.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hacettepe.edu.tr/english/hakkinda/tarihce|title=Hacettepe University|website=www.hacettepe.edu.tr|access-date=2017-10-04}}</ref>\n\n===Official Seal===\nThe emblem of the University was designed in 1967 by Dr. Y\u00fccel Tanyeri, then a second year medical student, in the likeness of a stag \u2013 the symbol of a [[Hittite mythology|Hittite]] deity discovered at the royal tombs in [[Alacah\u00f6y\u00fck]].

In 1961 the School of Health Sciences and its divisions of Nursing, Medical Technology, Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation and Nutrition were opened, all centered on the Institute of Child Health.\n\nOn June 15, 1963, Hacettepe University, Faculty of Medicine was established and a general teaching hospital was built. Three months later Hacettepe University School of Dentistry was established.\n\nIn the summer of 1964, a School of Basic Sciences was opened, offering courses in the natural sciences, social sciences and the humanities. At the time, all Hacettepe teaching institutions were affiliated to Ankara University and grouped under the title \"Hacettepe Science Center\".\n\nHacettepe University was chartered through Act No. 892 of the Turkish Parliament on July 8, 1967. Hacettepe Institutes of Higher Education formed the core of Hacettepe University, and the Faculties of Medicine, Science and Engineering, and Social and Administrative sciences were established.\n\nIn 1969 Hacettepe School of Pharmacy and Health Administration were established. In 1971 with a reorganization, the former schools were given faculty status and thus they became the Faculty of Dentistry, Faculty of Engineering, Faculty of Pharmacy and Faculty of Science. In 1973 the School of Technology was established. In I982 the former faculties were reorganized as the Faculty of Letters, Faculty of Education, Faculty of Fine Arts, Faculty of Economic and Administrative Sciences and the State Conservatory was affiliated to Hacettepe University. In 1984 the School of Health services and in 1989 the School of Sport Sciences and Technology were established. Recently in 1998 the two Polatli; Vocational Schools and Kaman Vocational School have been established.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hacettepe.edu.tr/english/hakkinda/tarihce|title=Hacettepe University|website=www.hacettepe.edu.tr|access-date=2017-10-04}}</ref>\n\n===Official Seal===\nThe emblem of the University was designed in 1967 by Dr. Y\u00fccel Tanyeri, then a second year medical student, in the likeness of a stag \u2013 the symbol of a [[Hittite mythology|Hittite]] deity discovered at the royal tombs in [[Alacah\u00f6y\u00fck]].

Located in Petersfield\u2019s Victorian Police Station and Courthouse, close to the centre of the town and in the heart of the South Downs National Park (SDNPA), the museum encompasses a complete Victorian justice complex including original cells, exercise yard, stables and cart shed.\n\nThe museum is currently undergoing a major redevelopment project (Pathways into the Past) and is closed to the public but will reopen in 2021!  \n\n==Location==\nPetersfield Museum is housed in the old Police Station and Courthouse on St Peter\u2019s Road in the centre of Petersfield.\n\n==Origins==\nPetersfield Museum opened its doors for the first time on the 15th May 1999 after almost a decade of planning. The idea of a museum in the town was first muted by the Chairman of the Petersfield Area Historical Society (PAHS) and along with the dedication and enthusiasm of the group\u2019s members strived to make it happen. \nThe Petersfield Museum Trust was established in 1996 and in the same year singed the lease for the recently disused Magistrates Court. \non the 15th May 1999, Petersfield Museum was opened for the very first time, manned by volunteers and using the artefacts donated by the PAHS. The Museum was open on Wednesdays and Saturdays and the first exhibition included a Victorian penny farthing, the town charter and Minibrix.\nEver since first opening, the museum has continuously grown and developed at an astonishing rate, to today where it is in the process of a multi-million-pound National Lottery Heritage Fund redevelopment.\n\n==Collections==\nThe Museum holds photographs, archives, oral history and maps relating to the town and surrounding area. A timeline feature takes the visitor through the history of the town alongside some temporary cases which  change over annually.\n\n===Archaeology===\nThe Museum\u2019s highly successful HLF-funded People of the Heath archaeological investigation focuses on a remarkable but little-known Early Bronze Age monument complex on the edge of the town. Dating to 2200 \u2013 1500 BC this group of barrows is one of the most impressive to have survived in south east England. Our project is giving rise to significant findings including, several rare collared burial urns and pots. In addition, Mesolithic Flints dating back to 8,000 years BC have been found during separate investigations undertaken on the same site and at the same time. This project is contributing towards the national body of knowledge regarding Bronze Age burials and has proved a huge stimulus for local interest in the area\u2019s history, including attracting dozens of dedicated new local volunteers to work on the project. \n\n===Social History===\nThis rich collection of archival material, documents and objects boasts a collection of over 8,500 photographs documenting the history of the local area. The artefact collection ranges from agricultural tools to objects that tell the stories of Petersfield industries, including the brewing industry and ITS (the rubber factory that made the famous Minibrix, forerunner of Lego), to domestic items offering insights into the lives of Petersfield\u2019s residents. We hold 80 oral history interviews, recorded in the time since the Museum\u2019s foundation. \n\n===Don Eades===\nIn 2015, the Museum was donated a collection of c100,000 photographic negatives taken by local press photographer Don Eades between 1962 and 1987. These images give a unique history and record of life in Petersfield and the surrounding area from that period. \n\n===Bedales Historic Dress===\nIncludes over 1,000 items from the 18th Century to modern day and was built up over a 50-year period by the local Bedales School. The collection mirrors 250 years of social and cultural change and includes rare and nationally significant pieces including an item recently loaned to the Design Museum for the \u2018Women Fashion Power\u2019 exhibition. A number of garments have strong local provenance and the great majority of the collection formed part of Bedales\u2019 theatre wardrobe. \n\n===[[Flora Twort]]===\nEncompassing nearly 1,000 works by local artist [[Flora Twort]], her most famous works document \u2018old Petersfield\u2019 including the cattle market and the famous horse fair on Petersfield Heath. Flora was part of a bohemian set of artists around the physician and social activist Dr Harry Roberts, who spent much of their time near Petersfield and socialised with renowned literary figures of the day. Flora was an artist of considerable merit and her work includes many instantly recognisable Petersfield locations and people. Her art offers insights into the past life of the town and the countryside which she recorded with great attention to detail. In this sense the collection is a valuable historical resource that links closely to the local area whilst, at the same time, the quality and breadth of her work makes it an invaluable source for art education. \n\n==Pathways into the Past==\nPathways into the Past is Petersfield Museum's \u00a33.7million National Lottery Heritage Funded redevelopment project. The project will transform the buildings, exhibitions and programmes as well as create an exciting new outdoor space in the courtyard. There will have room to show far more than ever before, putting Petersfield Museum and its glorious surroundings on the map for local people and tourists alike. \nFor the first time the museum's collections will be combined to tell a cohesive story of Petersfield and the surrounding villages. There will also be a servery for food and drink, a dedicated learning space for educational groups as well as an exciting new programme of events from film screenings to lectures, gin tasting to after school clubs. There will also be a new gallery allowing the museum to host travelling exhibitions from national museum's.    \n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.petersfieldmuseum.co.uk Petersfield Museum and the Flora Twort Gallery]\n* [http://www.culture24.org.uk/se000572 Entry] in the [[24 Hour Museum]]\n\n[[Category:Museums established in 1999]]\n[[Category:Petersfield]]\n[[Category:History of Hampshire]]\n[[Category:Museums in Hampshire]]\n[[Category:Local museums in Hampshire]]\n[[Category:1999 establishments in England]]\n[[Category:Art museums and galleries in Hampshire]]\n[[Category:Biographical museums in Hampshire]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Local museum in Petersfield, Hampshire, England}}\n{{refimprove|date=February 2019}}\n{{coord|51.0030|-0.9362|display=title|region:GB_scale:2000}}\n\n\n'''Petersfield Museum''' tells the story of the historical market town of Petersfield and surrounding villages, its people and landscapes and is home to a number of nationally significant collections.

We hold 80 oral history interviews, recorded in the time since the Museum\u2019s foundation. \n\n===Don Eades===\nIn 2015, the Museum was donated a collection of c100,000 photographic negatives taken by local press photographer Don Eades between 1962 and 1987. These images give a unique history and record of life in Petersfield and the surrounding area from that period. \n\n===Bedales Historic Dress===\nIncludes over 1,000 items from the 18th Century to modern day and was built up over a 50-year period by the local Bedales School. The collection mirrors 250 years of social and cultural change and includes rare and nationally significant pieces including an item recently loaned to the Design Museum for the \u2018Women Fashion Power\u2019 exhibition. A number of garments have strong local provenance and the great majority of the collection formed part of Bedales\u2019 theatre wardrobe. \n\n===[[Flora Twort]]===\nEncompassing nearly 1,000 works by local artist [[Flora Twort]], her most famous works document \u2018old Petersfield\u2019 including the cattle market and the famous horse fair on Petersfield Heath. Flora was part of a bohemian set of artists around the physician and social activist Dr Harry Roberts, who spent much of their time near Petersfield and socialised with renowned literary figures of the day. Flora was an artist of considerable merit and her work includes many instantly recognisable Petersfield locations and people. Her art offers insights into the past life of the town and the countryside which she recorded with great attention to detail. In this sense the collection is a valuable historical resource that links closely to the local area whilst, at the same time, the quality and breadth of her work makes it an invaluable source for art education. \n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.petersfieldmuseum.co.uk Petersfield Museum and the Flora Twort Gallery]\n* [http://www.culture24.org.uk/se000572 Entry] in the [[24 Hour Museum]]\n\n[[Category:Museums established in 1999]]\n[[Category:Petersfield]]\n[[Category:History of Hampshire]]\n[[Category:Museums in Hampshire]]\n[[Category:Local museums in Hampshire]]\n[[Category:1999 establishments in England]]\n[[Category:Art museums and galleries in Hampshire]]\n[[Category:Biographical museums in Hampshire]]\n", "name_user": "Petersfield Museum", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petersfield_Museum"}

Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa assumed leadership of the [[Sangha|monastic community]] following the ''[[Paranirvana|paranirv\u0101\u1e47a]]'' (death) of the Buddha, presiding over the [[First Buddhist council|First Buddhist Council]]. He was considered to be the first [[zushi (Buddhism)|patriarch]] in a number of [[early Buddhism|early Buddhist schools]] and continued to have an important role as patriarch in the [[Chan Buddhism|Chan]] and [[Zen]] traditions. In Buddhist texts, he assumed many identities, that of a renunciant saint, a lawgiver, an anti-establishment figure, but also a \"guarantor of future justice\" in the time of Maitreya{{sfn |Ray |1994 |p=117}}{{em dash}}he has been described as \"both the anchorite and the friend of mankind, even of the outcast\".{{sfn |Rhys Davids |1914 |p=160}}\n\nIn canonical Buddhist texts in several traditions, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was born as Pippali in a ''[[brahmin]]'' family, and entered an arranged marriage with a woman named [[Bhadda Kapilani|Bhadra-Kapil\u0101n\u012b]]. Both of them aspired to lead a celibate life, however, and they decided not to consummate their marriage. Having grown weary of the agricultural profession and the damage it did, they both left the lay life behind to become mendicants. Pippali later met the Buddha, under whom he was [[upasampada|ordained as a monk]], named ''K\u0101\u015byapa'', but later called ''Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa'' to distinguish him from other disciples. Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa became an important disciple of the Buddha, to the extent that the Buddha exchanged his [[Kasaya (clothing)|robe]] with him, which was a symbol of the transmittance of the [[Buddha's Dispensation|Buddhist teaching]]. He became foremost in [[dhutanga|ascetic practices]] and attained [[enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]] shortly after. He often had disputes with [[\u0100nanda]], the attendant of the Buddha, due to their different dispositions and views. Despite his ascetic, strict and stern reputation, he paid an interest in community matters and teaching, and was known for his compassion for the poor, which sometimes caused him to be depicted as an anti-establishment figure. He had a prominent role in the cremation of the Buddha, acting as a sort of eldest son of the Buddha, as well as being the leader in the subsequent First Council. He is depicted as hesitatingly allowing \u0100nanda to participate in the council, and chastising him afterwards for a number of offenses the latter was regarded to have committed.\n\nMah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's life as described in the early Buddhist texts has been considerably studied by scholars, who have been skeptical about his role in the cremation, his role toward \u0100nanda and the historical validity of the council itself. A number of scholars have hypothesized that the accounts have later been embellished to emphasize the values of the Buddhist establishment Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa stood for, emphasizing [[vinaya|monastic discipline]], ''brahmin'' and ascetic values, as opposed to the values of \u0100nanda and other disciples. Regardless, it is clear that Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa had an important role in the early days of the Buddhist community after the Buddha's ''parinirv\u0101\u1e47a'', to help establish a stable monastic tradition. He effectively became the leader for the first twenty years after the Buddha, as he had become the most influential figure in the monastic community. For this reason, he was regarded by many early Buddhist schools as a sort of first patriarch, and was seen to have started a [[lineage (Buddhism)|lineage]] of patriarchs of Buddhism. This further amplified the idea of him being the primary heir and eldest son of the Buddha, which came to be symbolized by the robe Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa had received.\n\nIn many post-canonical texts, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa decided at the end of his life to enter a state of [[Nirodha-sam\u0101patti|meditation and suspended animation]], which was believed to cause his physical remains to stay intact in a cave under a mountain called [[Kukku\u1e6dap\u0101da]], until the coming of [[Maitreya Buddha]] in a next age. This story has led to several [[cult (religious practice)|cults]] and practices, and affected some Buddhist countries up until early modern times. It has been interpreted by scholars as a narrative to physically connect Gautama Buddha with the next Buddha Maitreya, through the body of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa and Gautama Buddha's robe, which covered Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's remains. In Chan Buddhism, this account was less emphasized, but Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was seen to have received a special mind-to-mind transmission from Gautama Buddha outside of orthodox scripture, which became essential to the identity of Chan. Again, the robe was an important symbol in this transmission. Apart from having a role in texts and lineage, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa has often been depicted in Buddhist art as a symbol of reassurance and hope for the future of Buddhism.\n\n== In early Buddhist texts ==\nIn the [[Early Buddhist Texts]] of several textual traditions, a dozen [[sutra|discourses]] attributed to Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa have been compiled in a separate section. In the P\u0101li tradition, this is part of the collection called the ''[[Sa\u1e43yutta Nik\u0101ya]]'', and in the [[Chinese Buddhist canon|Chinese Buddhist texts]], the collection is called the ''[[\u0100gama (Buddhism)#Sa\u1e43yukta \u0100gama|Sa\u1e43yukta \u0100gama]]''. The latter collection contains two versions of the section on Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa, numbered [[Taisho Tripitaka|Taish\u014d]] 2:99 and 2:100.{{sfn |Mun-keat |2017 |p=295}} The Chinese ''[[Ekottara Agama|Ekottara \u0100gama]]'' also contains a passage that runs parallel to the P\u0101li ''Sa\u1e43yutta'', T2:99 and T2:100, describing a meeting between the Buddha and Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa,{{sfn |Analayo |2015 |pp=12\u201321}} and another passage about him and the monk [[Bakkula]].{{sfn |Analayo |2010 |p=1}} Finally, there are also [[Vinaya]] texts from the [[M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da]] tradition about Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa in [[Tibetan Buddhist canon|Tibetan language]].{{sfn |Clarke |2014 |p=110}}\n\n=== Early life ===\n[[File:Pipphali.jpg|thumb|Pippala Cave in [[Rajgir]], where Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa is recorded to have stayed.{{sfn |Bapat |1956 |p=319}}]]\nP\u0101li accounts relate that Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was born Pippali in a ''[[brahmin]]'' family in a village called Mah\u0101tittha, [[Magadha]], present-day India.{{sfn |Karaluvinna |2002 |p=435}} His father was a wealthy landlord who in some sources is named Nyagrodha, and in other sources Kapila or Kosigotta; his mother was Suman\u0101dev\u012b.{{refn |For the father's occupation, see {{harvtxt |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Bhadra-Kapil\u0101n\u012b}}.

However, her parents wanted her to marry, and to please her mother, she agreed to pay her respects to a shrine of a goddess known for granting a marriage in a high-class family. When she approached the image, however, people noticed that the image appeared ugly compared to her.

Scholar of religion Ellison Banks Findly disagrees, however, because the account in the texts of monastic discipline fits in with the ''Mah\u0101parinibb\u0101na Sutta'' and with \u0100nanda's character as generally depicted in the texts.{{sfn |Findly |1992 |p=268}} Minayev thought the charges were an ancient tradition, because they are not usually the material of legends, because the Chinese pilgrim [[Xuanzang]] (602\u2013664) reported about a ''[[stupa|st\u016bpa]]'' ({{lang-pi|th\u016bpa|italic=yes}}; a memorial mound or monument) that was erected in memory of the event,<!--31--> and because the ambiguity about what constitutes major and minor rules would have been typical for that period.<!--32-->{{sfn |Minayev |1894 |pp=31\u201332}}\n\nExpanding on the theory of the two factions, Przyluski noted that the figure of \u0100nanda represents Buddhism in an early form, whereas Mah\u0101ka\u015byapa represents a Buddhism that had undergone reform. \u0100nanda represents a \"religion of love\", whereas Mah\u0101ka\u015byapa represents \"a rough ascetic spirit\".{{sfn |Analayo |2016 |p=172, note 75}} Migot interpreted \u0100nanda's figure as a devotionalist form of Buddhism focused on the guru, replaced by Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's established monasticism with less focus on devotion.{{sfn |Ray |1994 |p=147 note 57}}\n\nAlthough the Buddha did not appoint a formal successor, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's leading role and seniority effectively made him the head of the ''sa\u1e43gha'' during the first twenty years after the Buddha's ''parinirv\u0101\u1e47a''.{{sfn |Heim |2004 |p=468}} After the passing away of the Buddha and his close disciples \u015a\u0101riputra and Maudgaly\u0101yana, he had become the most influential figure in the Buddhist order.{{sfn |Hirakawa |1990 |pp=84\u201385}} In the Early Buddhist Texts, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's death is not discussed.

This may have been the work of the translators.{{sfn |Mun-keat |2017 |p=303}} In Mah\u0101y\u0101na iconography, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa is often depicted flanking the Buddha at the left side, together with \u0100nanda at the right.{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Er xieshi}} The two disciples have been very popular in art depictions since the time of [[Greco-Buddhism]],<!--417--> and Migot argued that the tradition of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa and \u0100nanda being the Buddha's two main disciples was older than that of the tradition of \u015a\u0101riputra and Maudgaly\u0101yana, because in the ''Mah\u0101parinibb\u0101na Sutta'' only the former pair features, and the traditional explanation for this that \u015a\u0101riputra and Maudgaly\u0101yana did not outlive the Buddha seems unconvincing.<!--536-->{{sfn |Migot |1954 |pp=417, 536}}{{refn |group=note |As for Therav\u0101da iconography, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa is usually not depicted flanking the Buddha.{{sfn |Edkins |2013 |pages=42\u201343}}}} In Chan temples, the image of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa is often placed in a central position, being the first patriarch of the tradition.{{sfn |Jorgensen |2000 |pp=158, 271}} In the history of Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism, as the rag-robe asceticism of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa contributed to his legendary figure and the legitimation of the Mah\u0101y\u0101na creed, rag-robes became an icon in East Asian Buddhism.

Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa assumed leadership of the [[Sangha|monastic community]] following the ''[[Paranirvana|paranirv\u0101\u1e47a]]'' (death) of the Buddha, presiding over the [[First Buddhist council|First Buddhist Council]]. He was considered to be the first [[zushi (Buddhism)|patriarch]] in a number of [[early Buddhism|early Buddhist schools]] and continued to have an important role as patriarch in the [[Chan Buddhism|Chan]] and [[Zen]] traditions. In Buddhist texts, he assumed many identities, that of a renunciant saint, a lawgiver, an anti-establishment figure, but also a \"guarantor of future justice\" in the time of Maitreya{{sfn |Ray |1994 |p=117}}{{em dash}}he has been described as \"both the anchorite and the friend of mankind, even of the outcast\".{{sfn |Rhys Davids |1914 |p=160}}\n\nIn canonical Buddhist texts in several traditions, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was born as Pippali in a ''[[brahmin]]'' family, and entered an arranged marriage with a woman named [[Bhadda Kapilani|Bhadra-Kapil\u0101n\u012b]]. Both of them aspired to lead a celibate life, however, and they decided not to consummate their marriage. Having grown weary of the agricultural profession and the damage it did, they both left the lay life behind to become mendicants. Pippali later met the Buddha, under whom he was [[upasampada|ordained as a monk]], named ''K\u0101\u015byapa'', but later called ''Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa'' to distinguish him from other disciples. Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa became an important disciple of the Buddha, to the extent that the Buddha exchanged his [[Kasaya (clothing)|robe]] with him, which was a symbol of the transmittance of the [[Buddha's Dispensation|Buddhist teaching]]. He became foremost in [[dhutanga|ascetic practices]] and attained [[enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]] shortly after. He often had disputes with [[\u0100nanda]], the attendant of the Buddha, due to their different dispositions and views. Despite his ascetic, strict and stern reputation, he paid an interest in community matters and teaching, and was known for his compassion for the poor, which sometimes caused him to be depicted as an anti-establishment figure. He had a prominent role in the cremation of the Buddha, acting as a sort of eldest son of the Buddha, as well as being the leader in the subsequent First Council. He is depicted as hesitatingly allowing \u0100nanda to participate in the council, and chastising him afterwards for a number of offenses the latter was regarded to have committed.\n\nMah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's life as described in the early Buddhist texts has been considerably studied by scholars, who have been skeptical about his role in the cremation, his role toward \u0100nanda and the historical validity of the council itself. A number of scholars have hypothesized that the accounts have later been embellished to emphasize the values of the Buddhist establishment Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa stood for, emphasizing [[vinaya|monastic discipline]], ''brahmin'' and ascetic values, as opposed to the values of \u0100nanda and other disciples. Regardless, it is clear that Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa had an important role in the early days of the Buddhist community after the Buddha's ''parinirv\u0101\u1e47a'', to help establish a stable monastic tradition. He effectively became the leader for the first twenty years after the Buddha, as he had become the most influential figure in the monastic community. For this reason, he was regarded by many early Buddhist schools as a sort of first patriarch, and was seen to have started a [[lineage (Buddhism)|lineage]] of patriarchs of Buddhism. This further amplified the idea of him being the primary heir and eldest son of the Buddha, which came to be symbolized by the robe Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa had received.\n\nIn many post-canonical texts, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa decided at the end of his life to enter a state of [[Nirodha-sam\u0101patti|meditation and suspended animation]], which was believed to cause his physical remains to stay intact in a cave under a mountain called [[Kukku\u1e6dap\u0101da]], until the coming of [[Maitreya Buddha]] in a next age. This story has led to several [[cult (religious practice)|cults]] and practices, and affected some Buddhist countries up until early modern times. It has been interpreted by scholars as a narrative to physically connect Gautama Buddha with the next Buddha Maitreya, through the body of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa and Gautama Buddha's robe, which covered Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's remains. In Chan Buddhism, this account was less emphasized, but Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was seen to have received a special mind-to-mind transmission from Gautama Buddha outside of orthodox scripture, which became essential to the identity of Chan. Again, the robe was an important symbol in this transmission. Apart from having a role in texts and lineage, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa has often been depicted in Buddhist art as a symbol of reassurance and hope for the future of Buddhism.\n\n== In early Buddhist texts ==\nIn the [[Early Buddhist Texts]] of several textual traditions, a dozen [[sutra|discourses]] attributed to Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa have been compiled in a separate section. In the P\u0101li tradition, this is part of the collection called the ''[[Sa\u1e43yutta Nik\u0101ya]]'', and in the [[Chinese Buddhist canon|Chinese Buddhist texts]], the collection is called the ''[[\u0100gama (Buddhism)#Sa\u1e43yukta \u0100gama|Sa\u1e43yukta \u0100gama]]''. The latter collection contains two versions of the section on Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa, numbered [[Taisho Tripitaka|Taish\u014d]] 2:99 and 2:100.{{sfn |Mun-keat |2017 |p=295}} The Chinese ''[[Ekottara Agama|Ekottara \u0100gama]]'' also contains a passage that runs parallel to the P\u0101li ''Sa\u1e43yutta'', T2:99 and T2:100, describing a meeting between the Buddha and Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa,{{sfn |Analayo |2015 |pp=12\u201321}} and another passage about him and the monk [[Bakkula]].{{sfn |Analayo |2010 |p=1}} Finally, there are also [[Vinaya]] texts from the [[M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da]] tradition about Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa in [[Tibetan Buddhist canon|Tibetan language]].{{sfn |Clarke |2014 |p=110}}\n\n=== Early life ===\n[[File:Pipphali.jpg|thumb|Pippala Cave in [[Rajgir]], where Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa is recorded to have stayed.{{sfn |Bapat |1956 |p=319}}]]\nP\u0101li accounts relate that Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was born Pippali in a ''[[brahmin]]'' family in a village called Mah\u0101tittha, [[Magadha]], present-day India.{{sfn |Karaluvinna |2002 |p=435}} His father was a wealthy landlord who in some sources is named Nyagrodha, and in other sources Kapila or Kosigotta; his mother was Suman\u0101dev\u012b.{{refn |For the father's occupation, see {{harvtxt |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Bhadra-Kapil\u0101n\u012b}}.

However, her parents wanted her to marry, and to please her mother, she agreed to pay her respects to a shrine of a goddess known for granting a marriage in a high-class family. When she approached the image, however, people noticed that the image appeared ugly compared to her. Her reputation of beauty spread, and soon after Pippali's family learned about her, she was offered in marriage to Pippali.<!--111-->{{sfn |Clarke |2014 |pp=110\u2013111}}\n\nNext, in the P\u0101li version of the story, the two exchanged letters to indicate their lack of interest, only to find their letters intercepted by their parents and being forced to marry anyway.{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa}} In the M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da version of the story, however, Pippali went to visit Bhadra, and without revealing his identity, told her that her future husband would be a bad choice for her, because he had no interest in sensual pleasures.

Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was mostly associated with the texts of monastic discipline, during the fourth century until early third century BCE when Buddhism was prominent in [[Vaishali (ancient city)|Vai\u015b\u0101l\u012b]].{{sfn |Migot |1954 |pp=540\u2013541}} Bareau, Przyluski and Indologist [[I.

Scholar of religion Ellison Banks Findly disagrees, however, because the account in the texts of monastic discipline fits in with the ''Mah\u0101parinibb\u0101na Sutta'' and with \u0100nanda's character as generally depicted in the texts.{{sfn |Findly |1992 |p=268}} Minayev thought the charges were an ancient tradition, because they are not usually the material of legends, because the Chinese pilgrim [[Xuanzang]] (602\u2013664) reported about a ''[[stupa|st\u016bpa]]'' ({{lang-pi|th\u016bpa|italic=yes}}; a memorial mound or monument) that was erected in memory of the event,<!--31--> and because the ambiguity about what constitutes major and minor rules would have been typical for that period.<!--32-->{{sfn |Minayev |1894 |pp=31\u201332}}\n\nExpanding on the theory of the two factions, Przyluski noted that the figure of \u0100nanda represents Buddhism in an early form, whereas Mah\u0101ka\u015byapa represents a Buddhism that had undergone reform. \u0100nanda represents a \"religion of love\", whereas Mah\u0101ka\u015byapa represents \"a rough ascetic spirit\".{{sfn |Analayo |2016 |p=172, note 75}} Migot interpreted \u0100nanda's figure as a devotionalist form of Buddhism focused on the guru, replaced by Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's established monasticism with less focus on devotion.{{sfn |Ray |1994 |p=147 note 57}}\n\nAlthough the Buddha did not appoint a formal successor, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's leading role and seniority effectively made him the head of the ''sa\u1e43gha'' during the first twenty years after the Buddha's ''parinirv\u0101\u1e47a''.{{sfn |Heim |2004 |p=468}} After the passing away of the Buddha and his close disciples \u015a\u0101riputra and Maudgaly\u0101yana, he had become the most influential figure in the Buddhist order.{{sfn |Hirakawa |1990 |pp=84\u201385}} In the Early Buddhist Texts, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's death is not discussed.

This may have been the work of the translators.{{sfn |Mun-keat |2017 |p=303}} In Mah\u0101y\u0101na iconography, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa is often depicted flanking the Buddha at the left side, together with \u0100nanda at the right.{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Er xieshi}} The two disciples have been very popular in art depictions since the time of [[Greco-Buddhism]],<!--417--> and Migot argued that the tradition of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa and \u0100nanda being the Buddha's two main disciples was older than that of the tradition of \u015a\u0101riputra and Maudgaly\u0101yana, because in the ''Mah\u0101parinibb\u0101na Sutta'' only the former pair features, and the traditional explanation for this that \u015a\u0101riputra and Maudgaly\u0101yana did not outlive the Buddha seems unconvincing.<!--536-->{{sfn |Migot |1954 |pp=417, 536}}{{refn |group=note |As for Therav\u0101da iconography, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa is usually not depicted flanking the Buddha.{{sfn |Edkins |2013 |pages=42\u201343}}}} In Chan temples, the image of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa is often placed in a central position, being the first patriarch of the tradition.{{sfn |Jorgensen |2000 |pp=158, 271}} In the history of Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism, as the rag-robe asceticism of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa contributed to his legendary figure and the legitimation of the Mah\u0101y\u0101na creed, rag-robes became an icon in East Asian Buddhism.

The Anteaters were led by tenth-year head coach [[Russell Turner (basketball)|Russell Turner]] competing in the [[Bren Events Center]]. UC Irvine is a member of the [[Big West Conference]]. The team won their 2nd straight Big West Regular Season title before the [[2020 Big West Conference Men's Basketball Tournament]] and subsequently, the remainder of the [[2019\u201320 NCAA Division I men's basketball season]] and postseason tournaments were canceled as a result of the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|COVID-19 Pandemic]]. The team finished 21-11, and has won at least a share of 3 of the last 4 Big West Regular season titles. The program has won at least 20 games in 7 of the last 8 seasons. Turner became the winningest coach in program history on Jan 15 surpassing [[Pat Douglass]] total of 197 wins and won his 4th Big West Coach of the Year Award.
