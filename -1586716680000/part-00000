Holder had recommended this course of action to the President, arguing that the Defense of Marriage Act was unconstitutional, as laws that prohibit the marriage of gay couples do not meet the legal principle of [[strict scrutiny]]. Holder cited changing law in support of his action: \"Much of the legal landscape has changed in the 15 years since Congress passed DOMA. The Supreme Court has ruled that laws criminalizing homosexual conduct are unconstitutional. Congress has repealed the military's Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy. Several lower courts have ruled DOMA itself to be unconstitutional.\" This decision was prompted by legal deadlines in two federal cases in [[Connecticut]] and New York, where same-sex married couples argued that DOMA's ban on federal benefits to those in gay marriages approved by the individual states, violates the Constitution's requirement of equal treatment.<ref>{{cite web|date=February 23, 2011 |title=Statement of the Attorney General on Litigation Involving the Defense of Marriage Act |url=http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/statement-attorney-general-litigation-involving-defense-marriage-act |website=U.S. Department of Justice |publisher=Office of the Attorney General |accessdate=September 26, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140926053902/http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/statement-attorney-general-litigation-involving-defense-marriage-act |archivedate=September 26, 2014 |url-status=live  }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20035398-503544.html/ |title=Obama Administration Will No Longer Defend DOMA |publisher=CBS News |date=February 23, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110224122017/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20035398-503544.html |archive-date=February 24, 2011 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\nIn February 2012, Holder reaffirmed his position and stated that the DOJ would not defend DOMA in a legal challenge brought by members of the U.S. military, who were seeking benefits for their same-sex spouses, including: medical insurance, visitation rights in military hospitals and survivor benefits.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/02/ag-holder-doj-wont-defend-a-challenge-to-doma-brought-by-members-of-military/|title=AG Holder: DOJ Won't Defend a Challenge to DOMA Brought by Members of Military|publisher=ABC News|date=February 17, 2012}}</ref>\n\nHolder has also advocated for the interests of the 36,000 same-sex partnerships where Americans are in relationships with non-U.S. citizens.

Two members of the Party had stood outside a polling station during the election in paramilitary uniforms, one carrying a nightstick. Claiming a lack of evidence, the Department of Justice dropped charges against the party, its chairman, and one of the two members who had stood outside the polling station. With the evidence presented, the Department of Justice successfully obtained a narrow injunction against the other. Former lawyers who had served under the Bush Administration have stated that the current DOJ under Holder is unwilling to prosecute minorities for civil rights violations. Three other Justice Department lawyers, in recent interviews,{{When|date=January 2019}} gave the same description of the department's culture, which department officials strongly deny. In the months after the case ended, tensions persisted.

That prohibition was continued in the ''[[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]]'' until 1969. Anyone who procured a miscarriage for a woman was liable to imprisonment for life, while a woman who procured a miscarriage for herself was liable to imprisonment for two years.<ref>''Criminal Code'', SC 1953-54, c. 51, s. 237(1),(2).  Section 237(1) provided:  \"Every one who, with intent to procure the miscarriage of a female person, whether or not she is pregnant, uses any means for the purpose of carrying out his intention is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for life.\"</ref>\n\nAs in other countries, illegal abortions were still performed, and some cases charged that this led to the deaths of women. The [[abortion trial of Emily Stowe]] (1879) is one early example.<ref>Constance B. Backhouse, \"The Celebrated Abortion Trial of Dr. Emily Stowe, Toronto, 1879\", ''Canadian Bulletin of Medical History/{{lang|fr|Bulletin canadien d'histoire de la m\u00e9decine}}'', Volume 8: 1991, pages 159\u2013187.</ref> Another such case, ''[[Azoulay v.

In both cases, the alleged abortion provider was ultimately acquitted of responsibility for the woman's death. Abortion rights activists like Marilyn Wilson, former executive director of the Canadian Abortion Rights Action League, say, \"Illegal abortions were common, but often of poor safety. Several hundred women per year died from botched abortions.\"<ref>\"Three decades of choice: Canada's landmark abortion law is 30 years old tomorrow.\" Marilyn Wilson. ''The Gazette'' May 13, 1999. pg. B.3</ref>\n\n== Liberalisation of abortion laws ==\n\n=== Chief Coroner Schulman ===\n\nThe movement to liberalize Canada's abortion laws began in the 1960s. Former Chief [[Coroner]] of [[Ontario]] [[Morton Shulman]] recalls that in the Sixties, abortion could be legally performed only to save the life of the woman, so there were practically no legal abortions. He stated that the pregnant daughters of the rich were sent to reliable physicians who did abortions for cash. He estimated that these physicians did twenty to thirty abortions per week. Women who were not rich were left to perform an [[unsafe abortion|abortion]] on themselves or go to what he called a \"nurse\" abortionist. Their method was commonly pumping [[Lysol]] into the woman's womb. The mortality rate was high and the infection rate over 50%. He added, \"By the time I became Chief Coroner, I had had the unpleasant experience of seeing the bodies of some dozens of young women who had died as a result of these amateur abortions.\"<ref name=\"shulman\">Shulman, Morton. ''Coroner,'' pp 58\u201361 Fitzhenry & Whiteside, 1975.</ref>\n\nChief Coroner [[Morton Shulman]] decided to publicize deaths from illegal abortions.<ref name=\"Gazdar2016\">{{cite book|author=Kaevan Gazdar|title=Feminism's Founding Fathers: The Men Who Fought for Women's Rights|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xznaDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT148|date= 2016|publisher=John Hunt Publishing|isbn=978-1-78099-161-0|page=148}}</ref> He instructed his coroners to call a public inquest into each abortion death.<ref name=\"Gazdar2016\"/> He describes one case that he believes was the turning point, that of 34-year-old Lottie Leanne Clarke, a mother of three children, who died of a massive infection in 1964 after an illegal abortion in spite of medical treatment and antibiotics. At the inquest into her death, the jury recommended that the laws about therapeutic abortion be revised. Dr. Shulman added that a federal government committee should review the question of abortion and the law. Newspapers published editorials recommending the reform of the abortion law. In 1965, the Minister of Justice, [[Guy Favreau]], wrote to Dr. Shulman that the recommendation would be considered in the program to amend the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]]. The eventual amendment closely followed the recommendations of the coroners' juries.<ref name=\"shulman\" />\n\n=== Partial de-criminalisation ===\n\nIn 1967, Justice Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]] introduced a bill which included an amendment to the provision of the ''Criminal Code'' which prohibited abortions.<ref name=\"MorganDavies2008\">{{cite book|author1=I. Morgan|author2=P. Davies|title=The Federal Nation: Perspectives on American Federalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EXjHAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA227|year=2008|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-230-61725-4|page=227}}</ref> The bill, known as the ''[[Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1968\u201369]]'', continued the basic prohibition on abortions, with the potential life sentence. However, the bill made an exception for abortions performed in a hospital with the approval of that hospital's three-doctor therapeutic abortion committee. The committee would have to certify that the pregnancy would be likely to endanger the life or health of the pregnant woman. The term health was not defined, and therapeutic abortion committees were free to develop their own theories as to when a likely danger to \"health\" (which might include psychological health) would justify a therapeutic abortion.<ref name=\"MorganDavies2008\"/>\n\nThis same bill also legalized homosexuality and [[contraception]], and would be the subject of one of Trudeau's most famous quotations: \"The state has no business in the bedrooms of the nation.\"<ref name=\"StettnerBurnett2017\">{{cite book|author1=Shannon Stettner|author2=Kristin Burnett|author3=Travis Hay|title=Abortion: History, Politics, and Reproductive Justice after Morgentaler|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=imhADwAAQBAJ&pg=PA76|date=1 December 2017|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-3576-3|pages=76\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"CBC\">{{cite video|title=Trudeau's Omnibus Bill: Challenging Canadian Taboos|medium=TV clip|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]|location=Canada|date=December 21, 1967|url=http://archives.cbc.ca/politics/rights_freedoms/topics/538/|last=|first=|language=|type=}}</ref>\n\nWhen he introduced the bill in 1967, Trudeau was Minister of Justice in the government of Prime Minister [[Lester Pearson]]. In 1968, Pearson retired and Trudeau succeeded him as prime minister. The bill did not pass before the 1968 election, but was re-introduced by [[John Turner]], Minister of Justice in the Trudeau government. Parliament passed the bill in 1969.<ref>''Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1968\u201369'', SC 1968-69, c. 38.</ref> In the 1970 federal statute revision, the provision was re-numbered as s. 251 of the ''Criminal Code''.<ref>''Criminal Code'', RSC 1970, c. C-34, s. 251.</ref>\n\n===Badgley report===\nIn 1975, a Committee on the Operation of the Abortion Law was appointed \"to conduct a study to determine whether the procedure provided in the Criminal Code for obtaining therapeutic abortions [was] operating equitably across Canada\", and to make recommendations \"on the operation of this law rather than recommendations on the underlying policy\". The Committee, known as the Badgley Committee after its Chair, Dr. Robin F. Badgley,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/thestar/obituary.aspx?n=robin-f-badgley&pid=157302950|title=ROBIN BADGLEY Obituary - Toronto, ON &#124; Toronto Star}}</ref> reported in January 1977. It found, quite simply, that \"the procedures set out for the operation of Abortion Law are not working equitably across Canada\". In large part, this was because the intent of the law was neither clear nor agreed upon. Access to abortion as set out in the Criminal Code was not available for many women due to variations in distribution of hospitals and doctors, and in whether Therapeutic Abortion Committees were set up and in doctors' interpretations of \"health\" for women, ages of consent, and parental notification requirements. The report recommended better family planning to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies; but their main conclusion was that abortion services were not being delivered as required.<ref name=\"dev-badgley\">\n{{cite book\n | title\t= Abortion: Constitutional and Legal Developments, Section D: The Badgley Report\n | publisher\t= Government of Canada, Law and Government Division\n | first \t= Mollie\n | last \t= Dunsmuir\n | date \t= \n | url\t= \n |postscript\t= .\n}}\n</ref>\n\n== Continued difficulties in access ==\nBy 1982, there were 66,319 legal abortions in Canada.<ref name=\"Ann Rauhala 1987\">\"Abortions more difficult to obtain, groups say Women must travel, borrow for procedure.\" Ann Rauhala. ''The Globe and Mail.'' Toronto, Ont.: January 30, 1987. pg. A.1</ref> Interpretation of the 1969 law varied widely between doctors and hospitals, leading to uneven access. The standard was the physical or mental well-being of the woman, to be decided by a hospital's Therapeutic Abortion Committee. However, there was no requirement for a hospital to have a TAC to evaluate women. Only about one-third of hospitals had one. Some committees took a liberal stance and allowed most requests, while others blocked almost all requests. Access to legal abortions was easy in major metropolitan areas, but much harder outside large cities. In the province of [[Prince Edward Island]], the lone Therapeutic Abortion Committee shut down, and there were no legal abortions in the province after 1982.<ref name=\"Canada 1988\">\"Abortion access widely varies across Canada.\" Joan Bryden. ''The Ottawa Citizen.'' January 30, 1988. pg. B.6</ref> The Therapeutic Abortion Committees often took days or weeks to make their decisions, pushing a pregnancy further along than it would have been otherwise. The women were not seen by the committee, and had no right to appeal a decision. Advocates for abortion rights believed that the choice should be made by the woman, rather than a panel of doctors.<ref>\"Continue clinic abortions despite law, group urges.\"\n''The Globe and Mail.'' March 17, 1982. pg. P.8</ref>\n\nBecause of the lack of facilities in smaller provinces and rural areas, women were often forced to travel to major cities at their own expense. In [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], there was only a single gynaecologist who performed abortions. Many women had to buy expensive plane tickets to Toronto or Montreal to get an abortion.<ref name=\"Ann Rauhala 1987\"/> Other women chose to travel to the United States, where abortions became available at many private clinics after the [[Roe vs. Wade]] decision. In 1982, 4,311 Canadian women travelled to the United States for an abortion.<ref name=\"Canada 1988\"/>\n\n== Legal challenges to the abortion law ==\n\n===Morgentaler challenges the law===\n[[File:Henry Morgentaler (2005).png|thumb|Dr. [[Henry Morgentaler]] was an abortion-rights advocate physician who fought numerous legal battles aimed at expanding abortion rights.]]\n\nIn defiance of the law, Dr. [[Henry Morgentaler]] began performing abortions at his clinic without approval of a Therapeutic Abortion Committee and in contravention of the law.<ref name=\"LewisDyck2001\">{{cite book|author1=Nancy Lewis|author2=Isabel Dyck|author3=Sara McLafferty|title=Geographies of Women's Health: Place, Diversity and Difference|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QtaHDnmMQTMC&pg=PA92|year=2001|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-203-18602-2|pages=92\u201394}}</ref> In 1973, Morgentaler stated publicly that he had performed 5,000 abortions without the permission of the three-doctor committees, even going so far as to [[videotape]] himself performing operations.<ref name=\"Stevenson2019\">{{cite book|author=Robin Stevenson|title=My Body My Choice: The Fight for Abortion Rights|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E5WWDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT72|year=2019|publisher=Orca Book Publishers|isbn=978-1-4598-1714-2|page=72}}</ref>\n\nThe Attorney General of Quebec prosecuted Morgentaler twice, and both times juries refused to convict him despite his outright admission that he had performed many abortions. The Attorney General appealed one of the acquittals. In 1974, the [[Quebec Court of Appeal]] overturned the jury's verdict, and Morgentaler was sentenced to 18 months in jail. Morgentaler then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada from the overturning of the jury verdict. He also challenged the constitutional validity of s. 251 under the division of powers. In 1975, the Supreme Court dismissed his appeal.<ref>[https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/2684/index.do ''Morgentaler v The Queen'', [1976<nowiki>]</nowiki> 1 SCR 616.]</ref> Public outcry over the decision caused the federal government to amend the ''Criminal Code'' (commonly known as the Morgentaler Amendment){{cn|date=October 2019}} preventing appeal courts from substituting a conviction for a jury's not-guilty verdict.<ref>Now found in the [https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-46/section-686.html#h-130097 ''Criminal Code'', RSC 1985, c.

In 1970, as part of the [[Abortion Caravan]], 35 women chained themselves to the parliamentary gallery in the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]], closing Parliament for the first time in Canadian history.<ref name=\"Sawer2008\">{{cite book|author=Marian Sawer|title=Women's movements: flourishing or in abeyance?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zq5OCPYG9jUC&pg=PA54|accessdate=November 28, 2011|date=June 24, 2008|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-46245-7|page=54}}</ref>\n\nUpon his release from prison in Quebec, Morgentaler decided to challenge the law in other provinces. Over the next ten years, he opened and operated private abortion clinics across the country in direct violation of the law. Following a fourth jury acquittal in 1984, the Ontario government appealed the decision. The Ontario Court of Appeal set aside the acquittal and ordered a re-trial.<ref name=\"Jhappan2002\"/>\n\nMorgentaler, in turn, appealed to the [[Supreme Court of Canada]]. \n\n===Supreme Court decision===\n\nIn a landmark decision, the Supreme Court declared in 1988 the entirety of the country's abortion law to be unconstitutional: ''[[R v Morgentaler|R.]]'' [[R v Morgentaler|v. ''Morgentaler'']].<ref>[https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/288/index.do ''R. v. Morgentaler''<nowiki>, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 30.</nowiki>]</ref> By a 5-2 decision, the Court held that section 251 of the Criminal Code was of no force or effect because it violated [[Section Seven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 7]] of the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]''. Section 7 states that: \"Everyone has the right to life, liberty, and the security of the person, and the right not to be deprived thereof, except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.\" The Court also held that the infringement could not be justified under [[Section 1 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|s. 1 of the ''Charter'']], which in some cases allows a government to provide a reasonable justification for the infringement.\n\nThere was no single majority judgment. Chief Justice Dickson, Justice Beetz, and Justice Wilson all wrote decisions finding the law to be unconstitutional, but for varying reasons in support. Justice McIntyre wrote the dissenting opinion.\n\nChief Justice Dickson held that \"[f]orcing a woman, by threat of criminal sanction, to carry a fetus to term unless she meets certain criteria unrelated to her own priorities and aspirations\" infringed the woman's right to [[Section Seven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms#Security of the person|security of the person]], as protected by s. 7 of the ''Charter''.<ref>''R v Morgentaler'', p. 63.</ref> Justice Wilson found that the law \"asserts that the woman's capacity to reproduce is to be subject, not to her own control, but to that of the state\" which similarly breached the right to security of the person.<ref>''R v Morgentaler'', p. 173.</ref><ref name=\"Jhappan2002\"/>\n\nHaving found that law infringed the right to security of the person, the majority then considered whether that infringement was consistent with the principles of fundamental justice, which is the second branch of s. 7 of the ''Charter''. The judges in the majority agreed that the procedural requirements to obtain an abortion, as set forth in the law, were especially troublesome. Only accredited or approved hospitals could perform abortions, which imposed a barrier to local access. The law also specified that women wanting an abortion were required to obtain approval from a \"therapeutic abortion committee\" in a hospital. The committee was composed of at least three physicians appointed by the hospital's board of members, and did not include the practitioner who was to perform the procedure.<ref>''R v Morgentaler'', pp. 65-66.</ref> The court found that the committee requirement was deeply flawed, in part because of the long delays caused by the committees and that in many hospitals, the committees were merely committees on paper and did not actually approve abortions.\n\nChief Justice Dickson held that \"the structure -- the system regulating access to therapeutic abortions -- is manifestly unfair. It contains so many potential barriers to its own operation that the defence it creates will in many circumstances be practically unavailable to women who would ''prima facie'' qualify...\" Noted barriers included a lack of hospitals with committees, doctors who did not wish to refer matters to committees, the lack of a standard meaning for \"health\" leading to inconsistent standards among committees, and geographical and financial differentials in treatment. He concluded the provision violated the principles of fundamental justice.<ref>''R v Morgentaler'', pp. 66-72.</ref>\n\nThe majority of the court in ''Morgentaler'' did not find it necessary to consider whether there was a substantive right to abortion under Section 7. Justice [[Bertha Wilson|Wilson]] was of the opinion that such a right existed, but the other judges in the majority made their decision on procedural grounds, relating to the insufficiencies in the committee process.\n\n===Attempts at a new law===\nFollowing the Supreme Court decision, the Mulroney government made two attempts to enact a new abortion law.\n\nIn the spring of 1988, the government first attempted to find a compromise solution that would give easy access to abortion in the early stages of pregnancy and criminalize late term ones. The motion in the House of Commons was defeated 147 to 76, voted against by both MPs who opposed easy access to abortions and those who opposed adding any abortion rules to the Criminal Code.<ref>\"Abortion motions rejected. Govt. given little help on new law.\" Stephen Bindman. The Ottawa Citizen. July 29, 1988. pg. A.1.FRO</ref>\n\nThe Supreme Court decision became an important issue in the [[1988 Canadian federal election|1988 federal election]] later that fall. Both the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative]] and [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] parties were sharply divided on the issue and neither party advanced a concrete platform on the abortion issue. Prime Minister [[Brian Mulroney]] declared he was opposed to \"abortion on demand\", but gave no details on what that meant legally.<ref>\"Silence broken: PM is opposed to abortion on demand.\" Heather Bird. ''Toronto Star.'' August 3, 1988. pg. A.1</ref> Liberal leader [[John Turner]] stated that MPs should be allowed to [[Conscience vote|vote their conscience]], but refused to give his own opinion on the issue. NDP leader [[Ed Broadbent]] had a firm position that abortion is a medical matter, not a criminal one, and should be left to a woman and her doctor.<ref>\"PM, Opposition leader vague on abortion law.\" Portia Priegert. ''The Vancouver Sun.'' October 26, 1988. pg. B.4</ref> The Mulroney government was returned in the 1988 election.\n\nIn 1989, the government introduced a much stricter bill in the House of Commons. If enacted, it would ban all abortions unless a doctor ruled the woman's life or health would be threatened. Anyone found in violation of the law could be imprisoned for up to two years.<ref>\"Turner admits abortion bill may be 'best we can get'\" Iain Hunter. ''The Ottawa Citizen.'' November 9, 1989. pg.

''The Gazette.'' May 30, 1990. pg. A.1.FRO</ref> In June 1990, a teenager from Kitchener, Ontario, was injured during a botched abortion performed in a man's home. Several days later, a Toronto woman, Yvonne Jurewicz, died from a self-induced, coat-hanger abortion.<ref name=\"torstar1\">\n{{cite web\n | title\t= Twenty years ago: Woman dies after performing abortion\n | publisher\t= Toronto Star\n | date \t= June 13, 1990\n | url \t= http://thewordsonwhat.wordpress.com/tag/yvonne-jurewicz/\n | accessdate\t= 2012-12-14\n |postscript\t= .\n}}. A 20-year-old Toronto woman has died after performing an abortion on herself, probably with a coat hanger, police say. Yvonne Jurewicz of Westminster Ave. was found dead Monday night in her west-end apartment. An autopsy performed yesterday revealed Jurewicz bled to death after aborting, said Detective Sergeant Thomas Imrie, who is heading the investigation.\n</ref>\nThese cases were reported in the news and the latter case was discussed at multiple levels of government. Speaking in the [[Legislative Assembly of British Columbia]], [[BC NDP|New Democratic]] MLA [[Darlene Marzari]] pointed out:\n\n<blockquote>For our purposes, though technically speaking the bill has not been proclaimed, Bill C-43 is, in the minds of the public and in the minds of women, now law. In fact, while we're dancing on the head of a pin and counting ourselves as angels, a woman in Toronto has died\u2014she bled to death\u2014three weeks ago. Her name was Yvonne Jurewicz, she was 20 years old and was probably afraid to go to the doctor and afraid to go to the hospital after she tried to abort herself. This is the sad fact of Bill C-43. While we debate the minor points of whether or not the Lieutenant Governor or the Governor-General of Canada has picked it up, we know that young women in this country are under the impression they will be considered criminals if they show up in an emergency ward door hemorrhaging.<ref>{{cite web |title=Hansard -- Tuesday, June 26, 1990 -- Morning Sitting |url=https://www.leg.bc.ca/content/Hansard/34th4th/34p_04s_900626a.htm#10573 |website=Legislative Assembly of British Columbia |publisher=Hansard Services |accessdate=14 July 2019}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nReform Party MP [[Deborah Grey]], who supported the bill, denied that this death, the first known death from illegal abortion in Ontario in twenty years, could have anything to do with the publicity surrounding the passing of Bill C-43.<ref>Personal communication, Deborah Grey, December 1990.</ref> But in Ontario, the connection was made. [[Richard Johnston (politician)|Richard Johnston]], [[Member of Provincial Parliament (Canada)|MPP]] suggested to Premier [[David Peterson]] that Ontario announce it would not start any third-party prosecutions against women or doctors, to prevent any further tragedies and to reassure doctors that they could go on providing services to the women of Ontario.<ref name=\"ont-hansard1\">\n{{cite web\n | title\t= Ontario Hansard, 13 June 1990, Oral Questions, ''Abortion''\n | publisher\t= Ontario Hansard\n | date \t= June 13, 1990\n | url \t= http://hansardindex.ontla.on.ca/hansardECAT/34-2/L046_90-4.htm\n | accessdate\t= 2012-12-14\n |postscript\t= .\n}}\n</ref>\n\nA few months later, the bill failed in the Senate on a tie vote. Under the rules of the Senate, a tie meant the measure was defeated.<ref>\"Bill's loss may be blessing for Tories.\" Joan Ramsay. ''The Ottawa Citizen.'' February 2, 1991. pg. A.7</ref> The defeat was somewhat unexpected since it was the first time since 1941 that the Senate, whose members are appointed, had outright defeated legislation passed by the House. [[Eike-Henner Kluge]] the director of the Canadian Medical Association ethics and legal affairs viewed that the bill was flawed ethically. [[Eike-Henner Kluge]] drafted an analysis for a Senate committee about Bill C-43 and his presentation may have swayed two votes to change resulting in a tie vote which resulted in the Senate not passing the Bill C-43.<sup>[[Eike-Henner Kluge#cite note-%3A0-5|[5]]]</sup>\n\nIn the wake of the controversy surrounding passage of the [[Goods and Services Tax (Canada)#Background|Goods and Services Tax]] the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative]] government did not wish to provoke a contest of wills with the Senate and announced it would not re-introduce the legislation. The fact that no subsequent government has re-visited this decision has been what has led to the unique situation of Canada having no abortion law whatsoever. Abortion was now treated like any other medical procedure, governed by provincial and medical regulations.\n\n===Later cases===\nThe court in ''Morgentaler'' did not consider the question of whether the unborn were included in the \"everyone\" who have the right to life. At that time, another case before the courts would have raised that issue; it was brought by [[Joe Borowski (politician)|Joe Borowski]], a Member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba. However, after the ''Morgentaler'' decision, the Court held that the ''Borowski'' case was [[mootness|moot]] since ''Morgentaler'' had struck down the provisions it was challenging.\n\nTwo further cases, ''[[Tremblay v. Daigle|Tremblay]]'' [[Tremblay v. Daigle|v. ''Daigle'']] and ''[[R. v. Sullivan]]'',<ref>[1991] 1 SCR 489.</ref> relied on the [[born alive rule]], inherited from English common law, to determine that the fetus was not a person: Sullivan could not be charged with murder of a fetus and Daigle could not seek standing in court as the guardian of a fetus. The 1989 Supreme Court of Canada case of Chantal Daigle<ref>''[[Tremblay v. Daigle|Tremblay]]'' [[Tremblay v. Daigle|v. ''Daigle'']], [https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/515/index.do?q=%28Tremblay+v.+Daigle <nowiki>[1989] 2 S.C.R. 530</nowiki>].</ref> is one of the most widely publicized cases concerning abortion in Canada after the law prohibiting abortions was overturned by the Supreme Court of Canada. Daigle's ex-boyfriend obtained a restraining order against her having an abortion. While the restraining order was issued in [[Quebec]], it was legally restricting Canada-wide. The Supreme Court of Canada ruled that only the woman could make the choice; the man had no legal say in a woman's choice to terminate a pregnancy or carry it to completion.\n\nDaigle had already had a late second-term abortion before the Court ruled on her case. While the case was fast-tracked, the progress was so slow that Daigle would have been in the [[late-term abortion|third-trimester]] had she waited for the ruling to be handed down. Daigle had an abortion in the United States while the case was before the Supreme Court of Canada. This was not made public until after the ruling, although it was not unexpected. This is in contrast to the [[Roe v. Wade|''Roe v. Wade'']] case in the United States where Roe had carried the pregnancy to term. That case, however, was different from the ''Tremblay'' v. ''Daigle'' case in that it was about whether abortion was legal. In the ''Tremblay'' v. ''Daigle'' case, the question was whether a male partner has a say in whether a woman can obtain an abortion. ruling\n\nTwo further cases addressed the \"interest in the fetus\". In [[Dobson (Litigation Guardian of) v. Dobson|''Dobson (Litigation Guardian of) v. Dobson'']],<ref>[http://canlii.ca/t/1fqkz Dobson (Litigation Guardian of)\u00a0''v''. Dobson], [1999] 2 S.C.R. 753.</ref> a grandfather attempted to act on behalf of a child born with cerebral palsy, supposedly resulting from a car accident in which the mother was the driver. He attempted to sue the mother with negligence in driving. The mother was in favor of the suit succeeding as it would have provided her with funds to raise her disabled child; her insurance company was defending the suit through subrogation. Citing the [[City of Kamloops v. Nielsen|''Kamloops v. Nielsen'']],<ref>Kamloops v. Nielsen, [https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/2490/index.do?q=kamloops <nowiki>[1984] 2 S.C.R. 2</nowiki>].</ref> the Court decided that courts cannot impose a [[duty of care]] on a pregnant woman toward her fetus because it would interfere with the exercise of her autonomy rights during pregnancy and faced difficulty in defining a standard of care in pregnancy. Only a legislature can do this. In ''Winnipeg Child & Family Services (Northwest Area) v. G. (D.F.)'',<ref>[https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/1562/index.do <nowiki>[I997] 3 S.C.R. 925</nowiki>].</ref> courts determined that a pregnant woman addicted to solvents could not be civilly committed for treatment.\n\n==Access throughout Canada==\nAbortions in Canada are provided on request and funded by [[Medicare (Canada)|Medicare]], to Canadian citizens and permanent residents (as with most medical procedures) in hospitals across the country. Abortion funding for hospitals comes from the various provincial governments (their overall health expenses are however paid for in part by the federal government). One-third of hospitals perform abortions, and these perform two-thirds of abortions in the country. The remaining abortions are performed by public and private-for-profit clinics.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n[[Medical abortion]] is available in Canada on a limited basis using [[methotrexate]], [[misoprostol]], and [[mifepristone]]. Clinical trials were done in 2000 in various Canadian cities comparing methotrexate to mifepristone, after approbation by the federal government. While both drugs had overall similar results, mifepristone was found to act faster.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060621162826/http://www.cbctrust.com/ru486_trials_canada.php Results of the Canadian trials of RU486, the 'Abortion Pill'.] (n.d.).

Many [[social conservatism|socially conservative]] Alliance supporters were angered at the prospect of [[Belinda Stronach]], who favoured abortion rights, winning the [[2004 Conservative Party of Canada leadership election|leadership election]] in early 2004, while some Conservatives objected during the [[2004 Canadian federal election|2004 federal election]] to the new party's perceived openness to legislation that would restrict abortion rights. In the March 2005 policy convention, in a narrow vote, the party voted to not introduce legislation on the subject of abortion. (Members can still introduce [[private members bill]]s on the issue.)\n\nThe Liberal Party, on the other hand, has a few anti-abortion members, but any potential new Liberal MPs have been told by their current leader that they will have to vote according to the party's abortion-rights policy, rather than according to their own conscience, when it comes to matters of abortion.

CARAL folded, and has been replaced by the [[Abortion Rights Coalition of Canada]], whose focus is on the objectives mentioned above. [[Feminist]] or [[pro-feminism]] organizations also contribute to promote the abortion rights approach.\n\nThe Canadian affiliate of [[Planned Parenthood]], now known as the [[Canadian Federation for Sexual Health]], is also in favor of abortion rights, and while it does refer pregnant women to abortion providers, it does not have a history (unlike its American counterpart) of engaging in widespread litigation in favour of legalized abortion.\n\n==Anti-abortion movement==\n[[File:National March for Life 2010 1.jpg|thumb|National March for Life in Ottawa, Ontario, in 2010]]\nThe [[anti-abortion movement]] disapproves of the lack of legal restrictions on abortion in Canada, and of abortions being funded by provincial health care programs,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clcns.com/taxfunding.htm |title=CLCNS.com |publisher=CLCNS.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-10}}</ref> even if the abortion is not for therapeutic reasons.

That prohibition was continued in the ''[[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]]'' until 1969. Anyone who procured a miscarriage for a woman was liable to imprisonment for life, while a woman who procured a miscarriage for herself was liable to imprisonment for two years.<ref>''Criminal Code'', SC 1953-54, c. 51, s. 237(1),(2).

The [[abortion trial of Emily Stowe]] (1879) is one early example.<ref>Constance B. Backhouse, \"The Celebrated Abortion Trial of Dr. Emily Stowe, Toronto, 1879\", ''Canadian Bulletin of Medical History/{{lang|fr|Bulletin canadien d'histoire de la m\u00e9decine}}'', Volume 8: 1991, pages 159\u2013187.</ref> Another such case, ''[[Azoulay v.

In both cases, the alleged abortion provider was ultimately acquitted of responsibility for the woman's death. Abortion rights activists like Marilyn Wilson, former executive director of the Canadian Abortion Rights Action League, say, \"Illegal abortions were common, but often of poor safety.

Former Chief [[Coroner]] of [[Ontario]] [[Morton Shulman]] recalls that in the Sixties, abortion could be legally performed only to save the life of the woman, so there were practically no legal abortions. He stated that the pregnant daughters of the rich were sent to reliable physicians who did abortions for cash. He estimated that these physicians did twenty to thirty abortions per week. Women who were not rich were left to perform an [[unsafe abortion|abortion]] on themselves or go to what he called a \"nurse\" abortionist. Their method was commonly pumping [[Lysol]] into the woman's womb. The mortality rate was high and the infection rate over 50%. He added, \"By the time I became Chief Coroner, I had had the unpleasant experience of seeing the bodies of some dozens of young women who had died as a result of these amateur abortions.\"<ref name=\"shulman\">Shulman, Morton. ''Coroner,'' pp 58\u201361 Fitzhenry & Whiteside, 1975.</ref>\n\nChief Coroner [[Morton Shulman]] decided to publicize deaths from illegal abortions.<ref name=\"Gazdar2016\">{{cite book|author=Kaevan Gazdar|title=Feminism's Founding Fathers: The Men Who Fought for Women's Rights|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xznaDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT148|date= 2016|publisher=John Hunt Publishing|isbn=978-1-78099-161-0|page=148}}</ref> He instructed his coroners to call a public inquest into each abortion death.<ref name=\"Gazdar2016\"/> He describes one case that he believes was the turning point, that of 34-year-old Lottie Leanne Clarke, a mother of three children, who died of a massive infection in 1964 after an illegal abortion in spite of medical treatment and antibiotics. At the inquest into her death, the jury recommended that the laws about therapeutic abortion be revised. Dr. Shulman added that a federal government committee should review the question of abortion and the law. Newspapers published editorials recommending the reform of the abortion law. In 1965, the Minister of Justice, [[Guy Favreau]], wrote to Dr. Shulman that the recommendation would be considered in the program to amend the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]]. The eventual amendment closely followed the recommendations of the coroners' juries.<ref name=\"shulman\" />\n\n=== Partial de-criminalisation ===\n\nIn 1967, Justice Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]] introduced a bill which included an amendment to the provision of the ''Criminal Code'' which prohibited abortions.<ref name=\"MorganDavies2008\">{{cite book|author1=I.

However, the bill made an exception for abortions performed in a hospital with the approval of that hospital's three-doctor therapeutic abortion committee. The committee would have to certify that the pregnancy would be likely to endanger the life or health of the pregnant woman. The term health was not defined, and therapeutic abortion committees were free to develop their own theories as to when a likely danger to \"health\" (which might include psychological health) would justify a therapeutic abortion.<ref name=\"MorganDavies2008\"/>\n\nThis same bill also legalized homosexuality and [[contraception]], and would be the subject of one of Trudeau's most famous quotations: \"The state has no business in the bedrooms of the nation.\"<ref name=\"StettnerBurnett2017\">{{cite book|author1=Shannon Stettner|author2=Kristin Burnett|author3=Travis Hay|title=Abortion: History, Politics, and Reproductive Justice after Morgentaler|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=imhADwAAQBAJ&pg=PA76|date=1 December 2017|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-3576-3|pages=76\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"CBC\">{{cite video|title=Trudeau's Omnibus Bill: Challenging Canadian Taboos|medium=TV clip|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]|location=Canada|date=December 21, 1967|url=http://archives.cbc.ca/politics/rights_freedoms/topics/538/|last=|first=|language=|type=}}</ref>\n\nWhen he introduced the bill in 1967, Trudeau was Minister of Justice in the government of Prime Minister [[Lester Pearson]]. In 1968, Pearson retired and Trudeau succeeded him as prime minister. The bill did not pass before the 1968 election, but was re-introduced by [[John Turner]], Minister of Justice in the Trudeau government. Parliament passed the bill in 1969.<ref>''Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1968\u201369'', SC 1968-69, c. 38.</ref> In the 1970 federal statute revision, the provision was re-numbered as s. 251 of the ''Criminal Code''.<ref>''Criminal Code'', RSC 1970, c.

The Committee, known as the Badgley Committee after its Chair, Dr. Robin F. Badgley,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/thestar/obituary.aspx?n=robin-f-badgley&pid=157302950|title=ROBIN BADGLEY Obituary - Toronto, ON &#124; Toronto Star}}</ref> reported in January 1977. It found, quite simply, that \"the procedures set out for the operation of Abortion Law are not working equitably across Canada\". In large part, this was because the intent of the law was neither clear nor agreed upon. Access to abortion as set out in the Criminal Code was not available for many women due to variations in distribution of hospitals and doctors, and in whether Therapeutic Abortion Committees were set up and in doctors' interpretations of \"health\" for women, ages of consent, and parental notification requirements. The report recommended better family planning to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies; but their main conclusion was that abortion services were not being delivered as required.<ref name=\"dev-badgley\">\n{{cite book\n | title\t= Abortion: Constitutional and Legal Developments, Section D: The Badgley Report\n | publisher\t= Government of Canada, Law and Government Division\n | first \t= Mollie\n | last \t= Dunsmuir\n | date \t= \n | url\t= \n |postscript\t= .\n}}\n</ref>\n\n== Continued difficulties in access ==\nBy 1982, there were 66,319 legal abortions in Canada.<ref name=\"Ann Rauhala 1987\">\"Abortions more difficult to obtain, groups say Women must travel, borrow for procedure.\" Ann Rauhala. ''The Globe and Mail.'' Toronto, Ont.: January 30, 1987. pg. A.1</ref> Interpretation of the 1969 law varied widely between doctors and hospitals, leading to uneven access. The standard was the physical or mental well-being of the woman, to be decided by a hospital's Therapeutic Abortion Committee. However, there was no requirement for a hospital to have a TAC to evaluate women. Only about one-third of hospitals had one. Some committees took a liberal stance and allowed most requests, while others blocked almost all requests. Access to legal abortions was easy in major metropolitan areas, but much harder outside large cities. In the province of [[Prince Edward Island]], the lone Therapeutic Abortion Committee shut down, and there were no legal abortions in the province after 1982.<ref name=\"Canada 1988\">\"Abortion access widely varies across Canada.\" Joan Bryden. ''The Ottawa Citizen.'' January 30, 1988. pg. B.6</ref> The Therapeutic Abortion Committees often took days or weeks to make their decisions, pushing a pregnancy further along than it would have been otherwise. The women were not seen by the committee, and had no right to appeal a decision. Advocates for abortion rights believed that the choice should be made by the woman, rather than a panel of doctors.<ref>\"Continue clinic abortions despite law, group urges.\"\n''The Globe and Mail.'' March 17, 1982. pg. P.8</ref>\n\nBecause of the lack of facilities in smaller provinces and rural areas, women were often forced to travel to major cities at their own expense.

The Attorney General appealed one of the acquittals. In 1974, the [[Quebec Court of Appeal]] overturned the jury's verdict, and Morgentaler was sentenced to 18 months in jail. Morgentaler then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada from the overturning of the jury verdict. He also challenged the constitutional validity of s. 251 under the division of powers. In 1975, the Supreme Court dismissed his appeal.<ref>[https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/2684/index.do ''Morgentaler v The Queen'', [1976<nowiki>]</nowiki> 1 SCR 616.]</ref> Public outcry over the decision caused the federal government to amend the ''Criminal Code'' (commonly known as the Morgentaler Amendment){{cn|date=October 2019}} preventing appeal courts from substituting a conviction for a jury's not-guilty verdict.<ref>Now found in the [https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-46/section-686.html#h-130097 ''Criminal Code'', RSC 1985, c.

Following a fourth jury acquittal in 1984, the Ontario government appealed the decision. The Ontario Court of Appeal set aside the acquittal and ordered a re-trial.<ref name=\"Jhappan2002\"/>\n\nMorgentaler, in turn, appealed to the [[Supreme Court of Canada]]. \n\n===Supreme Court decision===\n\nIn a landmark decision, the Supreme Court declared in 1988 the entirety of the country's abortion law to be unconstitutional: ''[[R v Morgentaler|R.]]'' [[R v Morgentaler|v. ''Morgentaler'']].<ref>[https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/288/index.do ''R. v. Morgentaler''<nowiki>, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 30.</nowiki>]</ref> By a 5-2 decision, the Court held that section 251 of the Criminal Code was of no force or effect because it violated [[Section Seven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 7]] of the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]''. Section 7 states that: \"Everyone has the right to life, liberty, and the security of the person, and the right not to be deprived thereof, except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.\" The Court also held that the infringement could not be justified under [[Section 1 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|s. 1 of the ''Charter'']], which in some cases allows a government to provide a reasonable justification for the infringement.\n\nThere was no single majority judgment. Chief Justice Dickson, Justice Beetz, and Justice Wilson all wrote decisions finding the law to be unconstitutional, but for varying reasons in support. Justice McIntyre wrote the dissenting opinion.\n\nChief Justice Dickson held that \"[f]orcing a woman, by threat of criminal sanction, to carry a fetus to term unless she meets certain criteria unrelated to her own priorities and aspirations\" infringed the woman's right to [[Section Seven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms#Security of the person|security of the person]], as protected by s. 7 of the ''Charter''.<ref>''R v Morgentaler'', p. 63.</ref> Justice Wilson found that the law \"asserts that the woman's capacity to reproduce is to be subject, not to her own control, but to that of the state\" which similarly breached the right to security of the person.<ref>''R v Morgentaler'', p. 173.</ref><ref name=\"Jhappan2002\"/>\n\nHaving found that law infringed the right to security of the person, the majority then considered whether that infringement was consistent with the principles of fundamental justice, which is the second branch of s. 7 of the ''Charter''. The judges in the majority agreed that the procedural requirements to obtain an abortion, as set forth in the law, were especially troublesome. Only accredited or approved hospitals could perform abortions, which imposed a barrier to local access. The law also specified that women wanting an abortion were required to obtain approval from a \"therapeutic abortion committee\" in a hospital. The committee was composed of at least three physicians appointed by the hospital's board of members, and did not include the practitioner who was to perform the procedure.<ref>''R v Morgentaler'', pp. 65-66.</ref> The court found that the committee requirement was deeply flawed, in part because of the long delays caused by the committees and that in many hospitals, the committees were merely committees on paper and did not actually approve abortions.\n\nChief Justice Dickson held that \"the structure -- the system regulating access to therapeutic abortions -- is manifestly unfair. It contains so many potential barriers to its own operation that the defence it creates will in many circumstances be practically unavailable to women who would ''prima facie'' qualify...\" Noted barriers included a lack of hospitals with committees, doctors who did not wish to refer matters to committees, the lack of a standard meaning for \"health\" leading to inconsistent standards among committees, and geographical and financial differentials in treatment. He concluded the provision violated the principles of fundamental justice.<ref>''R v Morgentaler'', pp. 66-72.</ref>\n\nThe majority of the court in ''Morgentaler'' did not find it necessary to consider whether there was a substantive right to abortion under Section 7. Justice [[Bertha Wilson|Wilson]] was of the opinion that such a right existed, but the other judges in the majority made their decision on procedural grounds, relating to the insufficiencies in the committee process.\n\n===Attempts at a new law===\nFollowing the Supreme Court decision, the Mulroney government made two attempts to enact a new abortion law.\n\nIn the spring of 1988, the government first attempted to find a compromise solution that would give easy access to abortion in the early stages of pregnancy and criminalize late term ones. The motion in the House of Commons was defeated 147 to 76, voted against by both MPs who opposed easy access to abortions and those who opposed adding any abortion rules to the Criminal Code.<ref>\"Abortion motions rejected. Govt. given little help on new law.\" Stephen Bindman. The Ottawa Citizen. July 29, 1988. pg. A.1.FRO</ref>\n\nThe Supreme Court decision became an important issue in the [[1988 Canadian federal election|1988 federal election]] later that fall. Both the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative]] and [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] parties were sharply divided on the issue and neither party advanced a concrete platform on the abortion issue. Prime Minister [[Brian Mulroney]] declared he was opposed to \"abortion on demand\", but gave no details on what that meant legally.<ref>\"Silence broken: PM is opposed to abortion on demand.\" Heather Bird. ''Toronto Star.'' August 3, 1988. pg. A.1</ref> Liberal leader [[John Turner]] stated that MPs should be allowed to [[Conscience vote|vote their conscience]], but refused to give his own opinion on the issue. NDP leader [[Ed Broadbent]] had a firm position that abortion is a medical matter, not a criminal one, and should be left to a woman and her doctor.<ref>\"PM, Opposition leader vague on abortion law.\" Portia Priegert. ''The Vancouver Sun.'' October 26, 1988. pg. B.4</ref> The Mulroney government was returned in the 1988 election.\n\nIn 1989, the government introduced a much stricter bill in the House of Commons. If enacted, it would ban all abortions unless a doctor ruled the woman's life or health would be threatened. Anyone found in violation of the law could be imprisoned for up to two years.<ref>\"Turner admits abortion bill may be 'best we can get'\" Iain Hunter. ''The Ottawa Citizen.'' November 9, 1989. pg.

''The Gazette.'' May 30, 1990. pg. A.1.FRO</ref> In June 1990, a teenager from Kitchener, Ontario, was injured during a botched abortion performed in a man's home. Several days later, a Toronto woman, Yvonne Jurewicz, died from a self-induced, coat-hanger abortion.<ref name=\"torstar1\">\n{{cite web\n | title\t= Twenty years ago: Woman dies after performing abortion\n | publisher\t= Toronto Star\n | date \t= June 13, 1990\n | url \t= http://thewordsonwhat.wordpress.com/tag/yvonne-jurewicz/\n | accessdate\t= 2012-12-14\n |postscript\t= .\n}}. A 20-year-old Toronto woman has died after performing an abortion on herself, probably with a coat hanger, police say. Yvonne Jurewicz of Westminster Ave. was found dead Monday night in her west-end apartment. An autopsy performed yesterday revealed Jurewicz bled to death after aborting, said Detective Sergeant Thomas Imrie, who is heading the investigation.\n</ref>\nThese cases were reported in the news and the latter case was discussed at multiple levels of government. Speaking in the [[Legislative Assembly of British Columbia]], [[BC NDP|New Democratic]] MLA [[Darlene Marzari]] pointed out:\n\n<blockquote>For our purposes, though technically speaking the bill has not been proclaimed, Bill C-43 is, in the minds of the public and in the minds of women, now law. In fact, while we're dancing on the head of a pin and counting ourselves as angels, a woman in Toronto has died\u2014she bled to death\u2014three weeks ago. Her name was Yvonne Jurewicz, she was 20 years old and was probably afraid to go to the doctor and afraid to go to the hospital after she tried to abort herself. This is the sad fact of Bill C-43. While we debate the minor points of whether or not the Lieutenant Governor or the Governor-General of Canada has picked it up, we know that young women in this country are under the impression they will be considered criminals if they show up in an emergency ward door hemorrhaging.<ref>{{cite web |title=Hansard -- Tuesday, June 26, 1990 -- Morning Sitting |url=https://www.leg.bc.ca/content/Hansard/34th4th/34p_04s_900626a.htm#10573 |website=Legislative Assembly of British Columbia |publisher=Hansard Services |accessdate=14 July 2019}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nReform Party MP [[Deborah Grey]], who supported the bill, denied that this death, the first known death from illegal abortion in Ontario in twenty years, could have anything to do with the publicity surrounding the passing of Bill C-43.<ref>Personal communication, Deborah Grey, December 1990.</ref> But in Ontario, the connection was made. [[Richard Johnston (politician)|Richard Johnston]], [[Member of Provincial Parliament (Canada)|MPP]] suggested to Premier [[David Peterson]] that Ontario announce it would not start any third-party prosecutions against women or doctors, to prevent any further tragedies and to reassure doctors that they could go on providing services to the women of Ontario.<ref name=\"ont-hansard1\">\n{{cite web\n | title\t= Ontario Hansard, 13 June 1990, Oral Questions, ''Abortion''\n | publisher\t= Ontario Hansard\n | date \t= June 13, 1990\n | url \t= http://hansardindex.ontla.on.ca/hansardECAT/34-2/L046_90-4.htm\n | accessdate\t= 2012-12-14\n |postscript\t= .\n}}\n</ref>\n\nA few months later, the bill failed in the Senate on a tie vote. Under the rules of the Senate, a tie meant the measure was defeated.<ref>\"Bill's loss may be blessing for Tories.\" Joan Ramsay. ''The Ottawa Citizen.'' February 2, 1991. pg. A.7</ref> The defeat was somewhat unexpected since it was the first time since 1941 that the Senate, whose members are appointed, had outright defeated legislation passed by the House. [[Eike-Henner Kluge]] the director of the Canadian Medical Association ethics and legal affairs viewed that the bill was flawed ethically. [[Eike-Henner Kluge]] drafted an analysis for a Senate committee about Bill C-43 and his presentation may have swayed two votes to change resulting in a tie vote which resulted in the Senate not passing the Bill C-43.<sup>[[Eike-Henner Kluge#cite note-%3A0-5|[5]]]</sup>\n\nIn the wake of the controversy surrounding passage of the [[Goods and Services Tax (Canada)#Background|Goods and Services Tax]] the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative]] government did not wish to provoke a contest of wills with the Senate and announced it would not re-introduce the legislation. The fact that no subsequent government has re-visited this decision has been what has led to the unique situation of Canada having no abortion law whatsoever. Abortion was now treated like any other medical procedure, governed by provincial and medical regulations.\n\n===Later cases===\nThe court in ''Morgentaler'' did not consider the question of whether the unborn were included in the \"everyone\" who have the right to life. At that time, another case before the courts would have raised that issue; it was brought by [[Joe Borowski (politician)|Joe Borowski]], a Member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba. However, after the ''Morgentaler'' decision, the Court held that the ''Borowski'' case was [[mootness|moot]] since ''Morgentaler'' had struck down the provisions it was challenging.\n\nTwo further cases, ''[[Tremblay v. Daigle|Tremblay]]'' [[Tremblay v. Daigle|v. ''Daigle'']] and ''[[R. v. Sullivan]]'',<ref>[1991] 1 SCR 489.</ref> relied on the [[born alive rule]], inherited from English common law, to determine that the fetus was not a person: Sullivan could not be charged with murder of a fetus and Daigle could not seek standing in court as the guardian of a fetus. The 1989 Supreme Court of Canada case of Chantal Daigle<ref>''[[Tremblay v. Daigle|Tremblay]]'' [[Tremblay v. Daigle|v. ''Daigle'']], [https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/515/index.do?q=%28Tremblay+v.+Daigle <nowiki>[1989] 2 S.C.R. 530</nowiki>].</ref> is one of the most widely publicized cases concerning abortion in Canada after the law prohibiting abortions was overturned by the Supreme Court of Canada. Daigle's ex-boyfriend obtained a restraining order against her having an abortion. While the restraining order was issued in [[Quebec]], it was legally restricting Canada-wide. The Supreme Court of Canada ruled that only the woman could make the choice; the man had no legal say in a woman's choice to terminate a pregnancy or carry it to completion.\n\nDaigle had already had a late second-term abortion before the Court ruled on her case. While the case was fast-tracked, the progress was so slow that Daigle would have been in the [[late-term abortion|third-trimester]] had she waited for the ruling to be handed down. Daigle had an abortion in the United States while the case was before the Supreme Court of Canada. This was not made public until after the ruling, although it was not unexpected. This is in contrast to the [[Roe v. Wade|''Roe v. Wade'']] case in the United States where Roe had carried the pregnancy to term. That case, however, was different from the ''Tremblay'' v. ''Daigle'' case in that it was about whether abortion was legal. In the ''Tremblay'' v. ''Daigle'' case, the question was whether a male partner has a say in whether a woman can obtain an abortion. ruling\n\nTwo further cases addressed the \"interest in the fetus\". In [[Dobson (Litigation Guardian of) v. Dobson|''Dobson (Litigation Guardian of) v. Dobson'']],<ref>[http://canlii.ca/t/1fqkz Dobson (Litigation Guardian of)\u00a0''v''. Dobson], [1999] 2 S.C.R. 753.</ref> a grandfather attempted to act on behalf of a child born with cerebral palsy, supposedly resulting from a car accident in which the mother was the driver. He attempted to sue the mother with negligence in driving. The mother was in favor of the suit succeeding as it would have provided her with funds to raise her disabled child; her insurance company was defending the suit through subrogation. Citing the [[City of Kamloops v. Nielsen|''Kamloops v. Nielsen'']],<ref>Kamloops v. Nielsen, [https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/2490/index.do?q=kamloops <nowiki>[1984] 2 S.C.R. 2</nowiki>].</ref> the Court decided that courts cannot impose a [[duty of care]] on a pregnant woman toward her fetus because it would interfere with the exercise of her autonomy rights during pregnancy and faced difficulty in defining a standard of care in pregnancy. Only a legislature can do this. In ''Winnipeg Child & Family Services (Northwest Area) v. G. (D.F.)'',<ref>[https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/1562/index.do <nowiki>[I997] 3 S.C.R. 925</nowiki>].</ref> courts determined that a pregnant woman addicted to solvents could not be civilly committed for treatment.\n\n==Access throughout Canada==\nAbortions in Canada are provided on request and funded by [[Medicare (Canada)|Medicare]], to Canadian citizens and permanent residents (as with most medical procedures) in hospitals across the country. Abortion funding for hospitals comes from the various provincial governments (their overall health expenses are however paid for in part by the federal government). One-third of hospitals perform abortions, and these perform two-thirds of abortions in the country. The remaining abortions are performed by public and private-for-profit clinics.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n[[Medical abortion]] is available in Canada on a limited basis using [[methotrexate]], [[misoprostol]], and [[mifepristone]]. Clinical trials were done in 2000 in various Canadian cities comparing methotrexate to mifepristone, after approbation by the federal government.

Many [[social conservatism|socially conservative]] Alliance supporters were angered at the prospect of [[Belinda Stronach]], who favoured abortion rights, winning the [[2004 Conservative Party of Canada leadership election|leadership election]] in early 2004, while some Conservatives objected during the [[2004 Canadian federal election|2004 federal election]] to the new party's perceived openness to legislation that would restrict abortion rights. In the March 2005 policy convention, in a narrow vote, the party voted to not introduce legislation on the subject of abortion. (Members can still introduce [[private members bill]]s on the issue.)\n\nThe Liberal Party, on the other hand, has a few anti-abortion members, but any potential new Liberal MPs have been told by their current leader that they will have to vote according to the party's abortion-rights policy, rather than according to their own conscience, when it comes to matters of abortion.

It involves the study and exploration of texts created in English literature. English studies include: the study of [[English literature|literature]] written in the [[English language]] (especially [[Novel|novels]], [https://literarydevices.net/play/ plays], [[short story|short stories]], and [[poetry]]), the majority of which comes from Britain, the United States, and Ireland (although English-language literature from any country may be studied, and local or national literature is usually emphasized in any given country); English [[composition (language)|composition]], including writing [[essay]]s, [[Short story|short stories]], and poetry; English [[language arts]], including the study of [[grammar]], [[linguistic prescription|usage]], and [[stylistics (linguistics)|style]]; and English [[sociolinguistics]], including [[discourse analysis]] of written and spoken texts in the English language, the [[history of the English language]], [[English language learning and teaching]], and the study of [[World English]]es. English [[linguistics]] ([[syntax]], [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[phonetics]], [[phonology]], etc.) is usually treated as a distinct discipline, taught in a department of linguistics.\n\nThe disciplinary divide between a dominant literature or usage orientation is one motivation for the division of the North American [[Modern Language Association]] (MLA) into two subgroups. At universities in non-English-speaking countries, the same department often covers all aspects of English studies, including linguistics: this is reflected, for example, in the structure and activities of the [[European Society for the Study of English]] (ESSE).\n\nIt is common for departments of English to offer courses and scholarship in the areas of the English language, literature (including [[literary criticism]] and [[literary theory]]), [[public speaking]] and [[speechwriter|speech-writing]], [[rhetoric]], [[composition studies]], [[creative writing]], [[philology]] and [[etymology]], [[journalism]], poetry, [[publishing]], [[literacy]], [[area studies]] (especially [[American studies]]), the [[philosophy of language]], [[theater]] and [[playwright|play-writing]], [[screenwriting]], [[communication studies]], [[technical communication]], [[cultural studies]], [[critical theory]], [[gender studies]], [[ethnic studies]], [[disability studies]], [[digital media]] and [[electronic publishing]], [[film studies]] and other [[media studies]], and various courses in the [[liberal arts]] and [[humanities]], among others. In most English-speaking countries, the study at all educational levels of texts produced in non-English languages takes place in other departments, such as departments of foreign language or of [[comparative literature]].\n\n==Fields==\n{{Literature}}\n''See also'' [[#Literature and cultural studies|Literature]] and [[linguistics]], along with [[List of academic disciplines]] \n* English [[linguistics]]\n* English [[sociolinguistics]]\n* [[Discourse analysis]] in English\n* English [[Stylistics (linguistics)]]\n* [[International English|World Englishes]]\n* [[History of the English language (education)|History of the English language]]\n* [[Composition studies]]\n* [[Rhetoric]]\n* [[Technical communication]]\n* [[English language learning and teaching]]\n* [[English literature]]\n**[[American literature]], including:\n*** [[African American literature]]\n*** [[Jewish American literature]]\n*** [[Southern literature]]\n** [[Australian literature]]\n** [[British literature]] (literature from some regions of the United Kingdom may be written in [[Celtic language]]s)\n** [[Canadian literature]] (a significant amount of Canadian literature is also written in [[French language|French]])\n** [[Irish literature]]\n** [[New Zealand literature]]\n** [[Scottish literature]]\n** [[Literature of Wales (English language)|Welsh literature]]\n** [[South African literature#English literature|South African literature]] (excluding works written in other languages)\n**[[Indian English literature]]\n***Dalit Writings\n\n==English major==\nThe '''English Major''' (alternatively \"English concentration,\" \"B.A. in English\") is a term in the United States and a few other countries for an [[undergraduate]] [[university]] degree focused around reading, analyzing, and writing texts in the [[English language]]. The term may also be used to describe a student who is pursuing such a degree.\n\nStudents who major in English reflect upon, analyse, and interpret [[literature]] and [[film]], presenting their analyses in clear, cogent [[writing]]. Although help-wanted postings rarely solicit English majors specifically, a degree in English hones [[critical thinking]] skills essential to a number of career fields, including [[writing]], [[editing]], [[publishing]], [[teaching]], [[research]], [[advertising]], [[public relations]], [[law]], and [[finance]].\n\n===History===\nThe history of English studies at the modern university in Europe and America begins in the second half of the nineteenth century. Initially, English studies comprised a motley array of content: the practice of oratory, the study of rhetoric and grammar, the composition of poetry, and the appreciation of literature (mostly by authors from England, since American literature and language study was only added in the twentieth century).<ref>For a survey of these developments, see Gerald Graff, ''Professing Literature.

It involves the study and exploration of texts created in English literature. English studies include: the study of [[English literature|literature]] written in the [[English language]] (especially [[Novel|novels]], [https://literarydevices.net/play/ plays], [[short story|short stories]], and [[poetry]]), the majority of which comes from Britain, the United States, and Ireland (although English-language literature from any country may be studied, and local or national literature is usually emphasized in any given country); English [[composition (language)|composition]], including writing [[essay]]s, [[Short story|short stories]], and poetry; English [[language arts]], including the study of [[grammar]], [[linguistic prescription|usage]], and [[stylistics (linguistics)|style]]; and English [[sociolinguistics]], including [[discourse analysis]] of written and spoken texts in the English language, the [[history of the English language]], [[English language learning and teaching]], and the study of [[World English]]es. English [[linguistics]] ([[syntax]], [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[phonetics]], [[phonology]], etc.) is usually treated as a distinct discipline, taught in a department of linguistics.\n\nThe disciplinary divide between a dominant literature or usage orientation is one motivation for the division of the North American [[Modern Language Association]] (MLA) into two subgroups. At universities in non-English-speaking countries, the same department often covers all aspects of English studies, including linguistics: this is reflected, for example, in the structure and activities of the [[European Society for the Study of English]] (ESSE).\n\nIt is common for departments of English to offer courses and scholarship in the areas of the English language, literature (including [[literary criticism]] and [[literary theory]]), [[public speaking]] and [[speechwriter|speech-writing]], [[rhetoric]], [[composition studies]], [[creative writing]], [[philology]] and [[etymology]], [[journalism]], poetry, [[publishing]], [[literacy]], [[area studies]] (especially [[American studies]]), the [[philosophy of language]], [[theater]] and [[playwright|play-writing]], [[screenwriting]], [[communication studies]], [[technical communication]], [[cultural studies]], [[critical theory]], [[gender studies]], [[ethnic studies]], [[disability studies]], [[digital media]] and [[electronic publishing]], [[film studies]] and other [[media studies]], and various courses in the [[liberal arts]] and [[humanities]], among others. In most English-speaking countries, the study at all educational levels of texts produced in non-English languages takes place in other departments, such as departments of foreign language or of [[comparative literature]].\n\n==Fields==\n{{Literature}}\n''See also'' [[#Literature and cultural studies|Literature]] and [[linguistics]], along with [[List of academic disciplines]] \n* English [[linguistics]]\n* English [[sociolinguistics]]\n* [[Discourse analysis]] in English\n* English [[Stylistics (linguistics)]]\n* [[International English|World Englishes]]\n* [[History of the English language (education)|History of the English language]]\n* [[Composition studies]]\n* [[Rhetoric]]\n* [[Technical communication]]\n* [[English language learning and teaching]]\n* [[English literature]]\n**[[American literature]], including:\n*** [[African American literature]]\n*** [[Jewish American literature]]\n*** [[Southern literature]]\n** [[Australian literature]]\n** [[British literature]] (literature from some regions of the United Kingdom may be written in [[Celtic language]]s)\n** [[Canadian literature]] (a significant amount of Canadian literature is also written in [[French language|French]])\n** [[Irish literature]]\n** [[New Zealand literature]]\n** [[Scottish literature]]\n** [[Literature of Wales (English language)|Welsh literature]]\n** [[South African literature#English literature|South African literature]] (excluding works written in other languages)\n**[[Indian English literature]]\n***Dalit Writings\n\n==English major==\nThe '''English Major''' (alternatively \"English concentration,\" \"B.A. in English\") is a term in the United States and a few other countries for an [[undergraduate]] [[university]] degree focused around reading, analyzing, and writing texts in the [[English language]].

Initially, English studies comprised a motley array of content: the practice of oratory, the study of rhetoric and grammar, the composition of poetry, and the appreciation of literature (mostly by authors from England, since American literature and language study was only added in the twentieth century).<ref>For a survey of these developments, see Gerald Graff, ''Professing Literature.

It is one of the largest and most important [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] buildings in [[Europe]]. Once a fortress and palace, the papal residence was the [[Avignon Papacy|seat]] of [[Western Christianity]] during the 14th century. Six papal conclaves were held in the Palais, leading to the elections of [[Benedict XII]] in 1334, [[Clement VI]] in 1342, [[Innocent VI]] in 1352, [[Urban V]] in 1362, [[Gregory XI]] in 1370 and [[Antipope Benedict XIII]] in 1394.\n\n==Description==\nThe Palais is actually two joined buildings: the old palais of [[Benedict XII]], which sits on the impregnable rock of Doms, and the new palais of [[Clement VI]], the most extravagant of the Avignon popes. Together they form the largest Gothic building of the Middle Ages, it is also one of the best examples of the International Gothic architectural style.

Avignon became the residence of the [[Pope]]s in 1309, when the Gascon Bertrand de Goth, as [[Pope Clement V]], unwilling to face the violent chaos of [[Rome]] after his election (1305), moved the [[Papal Curia]] to Avignon during the[[Avignon Papacy|\"Avignon Papacy]]\". Clement lived as a guest in the Dominican monastery at Avignon, and his successor [[Pope John XXII]] set up a magnificent establishment there, but the reconstruction of the old bishops' palace was begun in earnest by [[Pope Benedict XII]] (1334\u201342) and continued by his successors to 1364. The site, on a natural rocky outcrop at the northern edge of Avignon, overlooking the river [[Rh\u00f4ne River|Rh\u00f4ne]], was that of the old episcopal palace of the bishops of Avignon. The Palais was built in two principal phases with two distinct segments, known as the ''Palais Vieux'' (Old Palace) and ''Palais Neuf'' (New Palace). By the time of its completion, it occupied an area of {{convert|11000|m\u00b2|0|abbr=on}}. The building was enormously expensive, consuming much of the papacy's income during its construction.\n\nThe Palais Vieux was constructed by the architect Pierre Poisson of Mirepoix at the instruction of [[Pope Benedict XII]]. The austere Benedict had the original episcopal palace razed and replaced with a much larger building centred on a cloister, heavily fortified against attackers. Its four wings are flanked with high towers.\n\n[[File:Palais des papes grand chapel.jpg|left|thumb|upright|The Grand Chapel, where the Avignon popes worshiped.]]\n\nUnder Popes [[Pope Clement VI|Clement VI]], [[Pope Innocent VI|Innocent VI]] and [[Pope Urban V|Urban V]], the building was expanded to form what is now known as the Palais Neuf. An architect, Jean de Louvres, was commissioned by Clement VI to build a new tower and adjoining buildings, including a 52 m long Grand Chapel to serve as the location for papal acts of worship. Two more towers were built under Innocent VI. Urban V completed the main courtyard (known as the Court d'Honneur) with further buildings enclosing it. The interior of the building was sumptuously decorated with frescos, tapestries, paintings, sculptures and wooden ceilings.\n\n[[File:Main entrance of the Palais des Papes - 20050823.jpg|thumb|250px|The fa\u00e7ade of the palais neuf]]\n\nThe popes departed Avignon in 1377, returning to Rome, but this prompted the [[Papal Schism of 1378|Papal Schism]] during which time the [[antipope]]s [[Antipope Clement VII|Clement VII]] and [[Antipope Benedict XIII|Benedict XIII]] made Avignon their home until 1403.

The subject matter, while common in contemporary secular art, is as unexpected in a room supposedly dedicated to study as it is for a room in a papal apartment. The frescoes were probably painted by French artists, who were either highly influenced by Sienese art or assisted by Simone Martini and/or Matteo Giovanetti, both of whom served as Clement's court painter.\n\n===The Great Tinel===\nThis room was used primarily as a reception room. Covered with tapestries on starry blue background, there is actually nothing left of these sets. Indeed, a fire destroyed the palace in the 14th century: many parts have been restored or rebuilt.\n\nDuring conclaves, it is in this room that the cardinals met to elect a new pope. For the occasion, the room was walled and only a small opening was left open to provide all the necessary food. After each conclave, the walls were destroyed, revealing a vaulted room opening to the rest of the palace.\n\n===The chapels===\n====Saint-Martial chapel====\n[[File:Plafond de la chapelle Saint-Martial, par JM Rosier.JPG|thumb|Inside the Saint-Martial chapel]]\nLocated on the second level of the Saint-Jean tower, the ''[[Saint-Martial]] chapel'' relates through painting the main parts of Saint Martial's life.

It is one of the largest and most important [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] buildings in [[Europe]]. Once a fortress and palace, the papal residence was the [[Avignon Papacy|seat]] of [[Western Christianity]] during the 14th century. Six papal conclaves were held in the Palais, leading to the elections of [[Benedict XII]] in 1334, [[Clement VI]] in 1342, [[Innocent VI]] in 1352, [[Urban V]] in 1362, [[Gregory XI]] in 1370 and [[Antipope Benedict XIII]] in 1394.\n\n==Description==\nThe Palais is actually two joined buildings: the old palais of [[Benedict XII]], which sits on the impregnable rock of Doms, and the new palais of [[Clement VI]], the most extravagant of the Avignon popes. Together they form the largest Gothic building of the Middle Ages, it is also one of the best examples of the International Gothic architectural style. The construction design was the work of two of France\u2019s best architects, Pierre Peysson and Jean de Louvres, and the lavish ornamentation was the work of two of the best students of the School of Siena (Italy), [[Simone Martini]] and [[Matteo Giovanetti]].\n\nIn addition, the papal library housed in the Palais (the largest in Europe at the time with over 2,000 volumes), attracted a group of clerics passionate in the study of \"belles-lettres\", amongst them the founder of [[humanism]], [[Petrarch]].

Entitled \"Exposition de peintures et sculptures contemporaines\" (Exposition of contemporary painters and sculptors), it was the starting point for what would later become the [[Festival d'Avignon]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=8pDrHAAACAAJ&dq=palais+papes+exposition&hl=fr ]{{dead link|date=July 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe courtyard of the Palais des Papes is a central performance location during the [[Festival d'Avignon]], which is held every year in July.

These merits were highlighted by [[Viollet-le-Duc]], author of \u201cDictionnaire raisonn\u00e9 de l\u2019architecture fran\u00e7aise du XI<sup>e</sup> au XVI<sup>e</sup> si\u00e8cle\u201d (Dictionary of French architecture from the 11th to the 16th century), who referred extensively to the Palais, including the thickness and height of its towers, the strength of its crenelated walls, the use of arcs for support on its fa\u00e7ades and its ability to withstand heavy and drawn-out sieges.\n{{clear}}\n\n===The towers===\n[[File:Les douze tours du Palais des papes sur fa\u00e7ades Viollet-le-duc.jpg|thumb|upright=3|center|The palais des Papes and its towers \u2013 from the east<br />1 \u2013 \"tour de Trouillas\"<br />2 \u2013 \"tour des Latrines\" or \"de la Glaci\u00e8re\"<br />3 \u2013 \"tour des Cuisines\" (kitchen tower)<br />4 \u2013 \"tour Saint-Jean\"<br />5 \u2013 \"tour de l'\u00c9tude\"<br />6 \u2013 \"tour des Anges\" or \"tour du pape\"<br />7 \u2013 \"tour du Jardin\" (garden tower)<br />8 \u2013 \"tour de la Garde-Robe\"<br />9 \u2013 \"tour Saint-Laurent\"<br />10 \u2013 \"tour de la Gache\" (''derri\u00e8re'')<br /> 11 \u2013 \"tour d'angle\" or \"tour des Grands Dignitaires\" (''under'')<br />12 \u2013 \"tour de la Campane\"]]\n{{clear}}\n\n===Cl\u00e9ment VI studium, also called \"la chambre du cerf\"===\n[[File:Chambre du cerf - le fr\u00e8re du pape \u00e0 la chasse.jpg|thumb|upright|Detail of the paintings]]\nThe studium, or private study of Clement VI, is commonly called the ''chambre du cerf'' (room of the deer), on account of the justly-celebrated 14th-century frescoes, depicting courtly hunting scenes, that decorate the walls and vaults. The subject matter, while common in contemporary secular art, is as unexpected in a room supposedly dedicated to study, as it is for a room in a papal apartment. The frescoes were probably painted by French artists, who were either highly influenced by Sienese art, or assisted by Simone Martini and/or Matteo Giovanetti, both of whom served as Clement's court painter.\n\n===The Great Tinel===\nThis room was used primarily as a reception room. Covered with tapestries on starry blue background, there is actually nothing left of these sets. Indeed, a fire destroyed the palace in the 14th century: many parts have been restored or rebuilt.\n\nDuring conclaves, it is in this room that the cardinals met to elect a new pope. For the occasion, the room was walled and only a small opening was left open to provide all the necessary food. After each conclave, the walls were destroyed, revealing a vaulted room opening to the rest of the palace.\n\n===The chapels===\n====Saint-Martial chapel====\n[[File:Plafond de la chapelle Saint-Martial, par JM Rosier.JPG|thumb|Inside the Saint-Martial chapel]]\nLocated on the second level of the Saint-Jean tower, the ''[[Saint-Martial]] chapel'' relates through painting the main parts of Saint Martial's life.
