''Relief'' had been originally built in 1902, on the Columbia at [[Blalock, Oregon]], in [[Gilliam County, Oregon|Gilliam County]], and launched and operated as '''''Columbia''''', a much smaller vessel. ''Relief'' was used primarily as a freight carrier, first for about ten years in the [[Inland Empire]] region of Oregon and Washington, hauling wheat and fruit, and after that was operated on the lower Columbia river.  \n\nAfter 1918 the owners of ''Relief'' struggled to find cargo, as railroads and especially highway transport cut sharply into the steamboat share of the transport business.  ''Relief'' was seriously damaged in a sinking in late 1924, but was eventually raised, and returned to service for some time.  The vessel was abandoned in 1931. \n\n== Route ==\n===Rapids and portages ===\nIn its natural state, the Columbia river had a [[List of rapids of the Columbia River|many rapids and narrows]] which impeded navigation.  Moving upstream, at [[river mile]] 146.5 were the [[Cascades Rapids]], which were impassable upstream.  Next came [[Celilo Falls]], also known as The Dalles, which were a series of rapids, eddies, and chutes running between river miles 188 and 200.  Between river mile 200 and the mouth of the [[Snake River]], at river mile 325<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://columbiariverimages.com/Regions/Places/snake_river.html\n | title = \u201cSnake River, Washington\u201d\n | last = \n | first =\n | date =\n | website = Lewis and Clark\u2019s Columbia River\n | publisher =\n | access-date = 8 Apr 2020\n | quote= }}</ref>, the Umatilla Rapids were the most significant barrier to steamboat navigation.  \n\nThe river below the Cascades was called the Lower Columbia.  Between the Cascades and The Dalles was the Middle Columbia.  Upstream from The Dalles was called the Upper Columbia. Steamboats could not move upstream (except in rare cases by [[Lining (steamboat)|lining)]] through either Celilo Falls or the Cascades.  In favorable conditions, steamboats could be taken down through the rapids..<ref name = MillsChap6>{{cite book \n| author1-last = Mills \n| author1-first = Randall V. \n| author-link1 = Randall V.

''Relief'' had been originally built in 1902, on the Columbia at [[Blalock, Oregon]], in [[Gilliam County, Oregon|Gilliam County]], and launched and operated as '''''Columbia''''', a much smaller vessel. ''Relief'' was used primarily as a freight carrier, first for about ten years in the [[Inland Empire]] region of Oregon and Washington, hauling wheat and fruit, and after that was operated on the lower Columbia river.  \n\nAfter 1918 the owners of ''Relief'' struggled to find cargo, as railroads and especially highway transport cut sharply into the steamboat share of the transport business.  ''Relief'' was seriously damaged in a sinking in late 1924, but was eventually raised, and returned to service for some time.  The vessel was abandoned in 1931. \n\n== Route ==\n===Rapids and portages ===\nIn its natural state, the Columbia river had a [[List of rapids of the Columbia River|many rapids and narrows]] which impeded navigation.  Moving upstream, at [[river mile]] 146.5 were the [[Cascades Rapids]], which were impassable upstream.  Next came [[Celilo Falls]], also known as The Dalles, which were a series of rapids, eddies, and chutes running between river miles 188 and 200.  Between river mile 200 and the mouth of the [[Snake River]], at river mile 325<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://columbiariverimages.com/Regions/Places/snake_river.html\n | title = \u201cSnake River, Washington\u201d\n | last = \n | first =\n | date =\n | website = Lewis and Clark\u2019s Columbia River\n | publisher =\n | access-date = 8 Apr 2020\n | quote= }}</ref>, the Umatilla Rapids were the most significant barrier to steamboat navigation.  \n\nThe river below the Cascades was called the Lower Columbia.  Between the Cascades and The Dalles was the Middle Columbia.  Upstream from The Dalles was called the Upper Columbia. Steamboats could not move upstream (except in rare cases by [[Lining (steamboat)|lining)]] through either Celilo Falls or the Cascades.  In favorable conditions, steamboats could be taken down through the rapids..<ref name = MillsChap6>{{cite book \n| author1-last = Mills \n| author1-first = Randall V. \n| author-link1 = Randall V.

In 1896 the [[Cascades Locks and Canal]] were completed, which effectively joined the lower and middle river for navigation.  The portage railroad around Celilo Falls remained the only way to move steamboat cargo from the upper to the lower Columbia.\n\n===Railroad competition===\nRailroads and steamboats often competed for business.  There once had been steamboats operating on the upper Columbia river, but by 1883, railroad competition had been so successful that all river boats had been driven off the route.<ref name = MillsChap8>{{cite book \n| author1-last = Mills \n| author1-first = Randall V. \n| author-link1 =  \n| title = Sternwheelers up Columbia -- A Century of Steamboating in the Oregon Country\n| isbn = 0-8032-5874-7 \n| chapter = Ch. 8: The Wheat Fleet\n| lccn = 77007161 \n| location =  Lincoln NE \n| publisher = University of Nebraska \n| publication-date = 1947 \n| at = 105-106\n}}</ref>  Wheat farming became widespread in the region in the 1880s and 1890s, and the railroads could not handle the larger and larger wheat crops being produced.<ref name = MillsChap8/>  The Open River Navigation company was formed to meet the demands for transport by wheat farmers and shippers, and it built a number of steamers, including ''Relief''.<ref name = MillsChap8/>\n\n== Construction ==\n''Relief'' was rebuilt from the much smaller stern-wheel steamer ''Columbia'' (US registry 127689), which had been {{convert|77|ft|m|2|lk=on|abbr=on}} feet long, {{convert|20.4|ft|m|2|lk=on|abbr=on}} on the [[Beam (nautical)|beam]], with a depth of hold of {{convert|3.6|ft|m|2|lk=on|abbr=on}} feet.<ref name = 1903mvrList>{{cite book\n| last1 = [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury Dept]], Statistics Bureau \n| title = Annual List of Merchant Vessels\n| volume = 35\n| type = [[Fiscal year|FY]] end Jun 30, 1903\n| url = http://hdl.handle.net/2027/nnc1.cu05600138\n| location = [[Washington, DC|Wash.

It is part of the Greater Nottingham Education Trust.\n\nRecruiting its first pupils in 1953, on-site teaching was introduced in the following year and the school was officially opened in 1956. Consequently, the modern school speculates Carlton le Willows to have been founded as the first post-war [[grammar school]] in England. Its campus was split from 1962 when a separate [[secondary technical school]], Carlton le Willows Technical Grammar School, was established. The schools unified in 1973 and converted to a single comprehensive school; two local [[secondary modern school]]s, both founded in the early 20th-century, were also implicated in the merger. Carlton le Willows was granted [[Specialist schools programme|specialist]] [[Technology College]] status from 2002 until 2010, became a [[foundation school]] in 2007 and converted into an academy in 2011.\n\nIt operates on a single, {{convert|32|acre|ha|adj=on}} campus and its teaching follows the [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum]]. Pupils generally sit examinations for around eight [[General Certificate of Secondary Education]] (GCSE) qualifications, or equivalent diplomas, in [[Year Eleven]] (aged 15\u201316). Pupils have a choice to study three or four [[GCE Advanced Level (United Kingdom)|GCE Advanced Levels]] (A Levels) if they are admitted into the sixth form, though more vocational courses remain available.\n\n==History==\n===Demand and origins===\nDemand for secondary education in the [[Carlton Urban District]] was prevalent from about 1904, though proposals were consistently rejected by the superior [[Nottinghamshire County Council]].<ref name=\"Jan1934\">{{cite news|title=Carlton's Protest|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000321/19340104/019/0005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190706103409/https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/account/register?countrykey=0&showgiftvoucherclaimingoptions=false&gift=false&nextpage=%2Faccount%2Flogin%3Freturnurl%3D%2Fviewer%2Fbl%2F0000321%2F19340104%2F019%2F0005&rememberme=false&cookietracking=|url-status=dead|archive-date=6 July 2019|accessdate=17 August 2017|work=Nottingham Evening Post|date=4 January 1934|via=[[British Newspaper Archive]]|url-access=subscription|page=5}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Problem of Secondary|url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001898/19340104/150/0007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190706103435/https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/account/register?countrykey=0&showgiftvoucherclaimingoptions=false&gift=false&nextpage=%2Faccount%2Flogin%3Freturnurl%3D%2Fviewer%2Fbl%2F0001898%2F19340104%2F150%2F0007&rememberme=false&cookietracking=|url-status=dead|archive-date=6 July 2019|accessdate=21 May 2018|work=Nottingham Journal|date=4 January 1934|via=[[British Newspaper Archive]]|url-access=subscription|page=7}}</ref> Lamenting transport costs to the nearest provider, the [[Henry Mellish School and Specialist Sports College|Henry Mellish Grammar School]] in [[Bulwell]], it was again suggested in 1934 that the County Council commit to the establishment of a secondary school, a concept dismissed by the then-Chairman of the District Council as being \"a long way off\".<ref name=\"Dec1934\">{{cite news|title=Carlton School Scheme|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000321/19341220/014/0005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190706103622/https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/account/register?countrykey=0&showgiftvoucherclaimingoptions=false&gift=false&nextpage=%2Faccount%2Flogin%3Freturnurl%3D%2Fviewer%2Fbl%2F0000321%2F19341220%2F014%2F0005&rememberme=false&cookietracking=|url-status=dead|archive-date=6 July 2019|accessdate=16 August 2017|work=Nottingham Evening Post|date=20 December 1934|via=[[British Newspaper Archive]]|url-access=subscription|page=5}}</ref> However, it was also stressed that advocates should \"stick to it\".<ref name=\"Dec1934\"/> By 1949, focus switched to endorsing an accessible [[grammar school]],<ref name=\"Aug1949\">{{cite news|title=Carlton's School Need|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000321/19490825/042/0005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190706103646/https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/account/register?countrykey=0&showgiftvoucherclaimingoptions=false&gift=false&nextpage=%2Faccount%2Flogin%3Freturnurl%3D%2Fviewer%2Fbl%2F0000321%2F19490825%2F042%2F0005&rememberme=false&cookietracking=|url-status=dead|archive-date=6 July 2019|accessdate=17 August 2017|work=Nottingham Evening Post|date=25 August 1949|via=[[British Newspaper Archive]]|url-access=subscription|page=5}}</ref> encouraged by a post-war population increase connected to the developing coal and light engineering sector in western [[Nottinghamshire]].<ref name=\"Harwood28\"/><ref name=\"SchoolHistory\"/> As discontent surfaced once more upon the attainment of scholarships by 71 local schoolchildren to remote institutions, it was clarified that County authorities had finally agreed to the foundation of a secondary school.<ref name=\"Aug1949\"/> It was to be based in [[Gedling, Nottinghamshire|Gedling]], rather than neighbouring [[Carlton, Nottinghamshire|Carlton]];<ref name=\"GSLocation\"/> despite this, Gedling was likewise within the Carlton Urban District, which encompassed the area known parochially as ''Carlton-le-Willows''.<ref>{{harvnb|Meaby|1947|p=77}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|The Local Government Companion|2002|page=392}}</ref>\n\n===Grammar schools: 1952\u20131973===\n====Grammar school====\n[[File:CarltonleWillowsHall.png|thumb|The original grammar school building has been noted for its \"strong proportions and blonde brickwork\"]]\nDemanding [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]173,793, construction of a new grammar school began in 1952.<ref name=\"Harwood28\">{{harvnb|Harwood|2016|p=28}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Electrical Times|1953|p=514}}</ref> The building was designed by [[Council architect|County Architect]] E.

It is part of the Greater Nottingham Education Trust.\n\nRecruiting its first pupils in 1953, on-site teaching was introduced in the following year and the school was officially opened in 1956. Consequently, the modern school speculates Carlton le Willows to have been founded as the first post-war [[grammar school]] in England. Its campus was split from 1962 when a separate [[secondary technical school]], Carlton le Willows Technical Grammar School, was established. The schools unified in 1973 and converted to a single comprehensive school; two local [[secondary modern school]]s, both founded in the early 20th-century, were also implicated in the merger. Carlton le Willows was granted [[Specialist schools programme|specialist]] [[Technology College]] status from 2002 until 2010, became a [[foundation school]] in 2007 and converted into an academy in 2011.\n\nIt operates on a single, {{convert|32|acre|ha|adj=on}} campus and its teaching follows the [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum]]. Pupils generally sit examinations for around eight [[General Certificate of Secondary Education]] (GCSE) qualifications, or equivalent diplomas, in [[Year Eleven]] (aged 15\u201316). Pupils have a choice to study three or four [[GCE Advanced Level (United Kingdom)|GCE Advanced Levels]] (A Levels) if they are admitted into the sixth form, though more vocational courses remain available.\n\n==History==\n===Demand and origins===\nDemand for secondary education in the [[Carlton Urban District]] was prevalent from about 1904, though proposals were consistently rejected by the superior [[Nottinghamshire County Council]].<ref name=\"Jan1934\">{{cite news|title=Carlton's Protest|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000321/19340104/019/0005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190706103409/https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/account/register?countrykey=0&showgiftvoucherclaimingoptions=false&gift=false&nextpage=%2Faccount%2Flogin%3Freturnurl%3D%2Fviewer%2Fbl%2F0000321%2F19340104%2F019%2F0005&rememberme=false&cookietracking=|url-status=dead|archive-date=6 July 2019|accessdate=17 August 2017|work=Nottingham Evening Post|date=4 January 1934|via=[[British Newspaper Archive]]|url-access=subscription|page=5}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Problem of Secondary|url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001898/19340104/150/0007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190706103435/https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/account/register?countrykey=0&showgiftvoucherclaimingoptions=false&gift=false&nextpage=%2Faccount%2Flogin%3Freturnurl%3D%2Fviewer%2Fbl%2F0001898%2F19340104%2F150%2F0007&rememberme=false&cookietracking=|url-status=dead|archive-date=6 July 2019|accessdate=21 May 2018|work=Nottingham Journal|date=4 January 1934|via=[[British Newspaper Archive]]|url-access=subscription|page=7}}</ref> Lamenting transport costs to the nearest provider, the [[Henry Mellish School and Specialist Sports College|Henry Mellish Grammar School]] in [[Bulwell]], it was again suggested in 1934 that the County Council commit to the establishment of a secondary school, a concept dismissed by the then-Chairman of the District Council as being \"a long way off\".<ref name=\"Dec1934\">{{cite news|title=Carlton School Scheme|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000321/19341220/014/0005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190706103622/https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/account/register?countrykey=0&showgiftvoucherclaimingoptions=false&gift=false&nextpage=%2Faccount%2Flogin%3Freturnurl%3D%2Fviewer%2Fbl%2F0000321%2F19341220%2F014%2F0005&rememberme=false&cookietracking=|url-status=dead|archive-date=6 July 2019|accessdate=16 August 2017|work=Nottingham Evening Post|date=20 December 1934|via=[[British Newspaper Archive]]|url-access=subscription|page=5}}</ref> However, it was also stressed that advocates should \"stick to it\".<ref name=\"Dec1934\"/> By 1949, focus switched to endorsing an accessible [[grammar school]],<ref name=\"Aug1949\">{{cite news|title=Carlton's School Need|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000321/19490825/042/0005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190706103646/https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/account/register?countrykey=0&showgiftvoucherclaimingoptions=false&gift=false&nextpage=%2Faccount%2Flogin%3Freturnurl%3D%2Fviewer%2Fbl%2F0000321%2F19490825%2F042%2F0005&rememberme=false&cookietracking=|url-status=dead|archive-date=6 July 2019|accessdate=17 August 2017|work=Nottingham Evening Post|date=25 August 1949|via=[[British Newspaper Archive]]|url-access=subscription|page=5}}</ref> encouraged by a post-war population increase connected to the developing coal and light engineering sector in western [[Nottinghamshire]].<ref name=\"Harwood28\"/><ref name=\"SchoolHistory\"/> As discontent surfaced once more upon the attainment of scholarships by 71 local schoolchildren to remote institutions, it was clarified that County authorities had finally agreed to the foundation of a secondary school.<ref name=\"Aug1949\"/> It was to be based in [[Gedling, Nottinghamshire|Gedling]], rather than neighbouring [[Carlton, Nottinghamshire|Carlton]];<ref name=\"GSLocation\"/> despite this, Gedling was likewise within the Carlton Urban District, which encompassed the area known parochially as ''Carlton-le-Willows''.<ref>{{harvnb|Meaby|1947|p=77}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|The Local Government Companion|2002|page=392}}</ref>\n\n===Grammar schools: 1952\u20131973===\n====Grammar school====\n[[File:CarltonleWillowsHall.png|thumb|The original grammar school building has been noted for its \"strong proportions and blonde brickwork\"]]\nDemanding [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]173,793, construction of a new grammar school began in 1952.<ref name=\"Harwood28\">{{harvnb|Harwood|2016|p=28}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Electrical Times|1953|p=514}}</ref> The building was designed by [[Council architect|County Architect]] E.

Serial biopsies, taken from transplanted hearts within the recipients, were taken using a newly developed [[bioptome]], percutaneous transvenous [[endomyocardial]] biopsy. The histological samples were examined in the pathology laboratories for early signs of rejection, allowing early treatment interventions.<ref name=\":1\" /> The timing of her work coincided with the excitement in early heart transplant surgery, with Norman Shumway performing the first heart transplant in the USA in 1968.<ref name=\":2\" /> She was at Stanford at a time when Stanford was leading cardiac transplantation research on an international platform and when places like Stanford had relatively few leading female scientists.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThe grading system was soon adopted as the standard method for examining rejection and other cardiac diseases.

Billingham''' (n\u00e9e '''Macpherson)''' (September 20, 1930 - July 14, 2009) was a [[pathologist]] at [[Stanford University Medical Center]], who made significant achievements in the early recognition and grading of [[transplant rejection]] following [[cardiac transplantation]], known as '[[Billingham Criteria|Billingham's Criteria]]'. She also described chronic rejection and techniques in heart [[endomyocardial biopsy]].\n\nBorn in Tanzania, and educated in Kenya and subsequently qualified from the [[Royal Free Hospital]] in London, Billingham found herself developing rejection pathology and eventually becoming director of cardiac pathology at Stanford University Medical Center. She settled in the United States with her husband, who was also a doctor, and their two children, and died there in 2009.\n\n== Early life ==\nBillingham's father was posted as a British diplomat, to Tanzania.<ref name=\":3\" /> She was then born in 1930 in [[Tanga, Tanzania]], and then educated at Loreto School in Kenya. She had a sister, Shirley Anne. Moving to England, she gained admission to the Royal Free Hospital in London to study medicine, subsequently graduating in 1954.<ref name=\":1\">{{Citation\n| last = Stewart| first = Susan| last2 = Burke| first2 = Margaret| last3 = Billingham| first3 = John\n| title = Margaret Billingham| journal = The BMJ| volume = 340| issue = | year = 2010| pages = c1276| url = http://www.bmj.com/content/340/bmj.c1276| doi = 10.1136/bmj.c1276}}</ref><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2009/07/margaret-billingham-pioneer-in-heart-transplant-pathology-dies-at-78.html|title=Margaret Billingham, pioneer in heart transplant pathology, dies at 78|website=News Center|language=en|access-date=2018-01-01}}</ref>\n\n== Family ==\nShe met her future husband John Billingham while they were both doing their junior house posts.

Originally in cardiopulmonary medicine, she then switched to pathology in 1968. By 1988, Billingham was professor in pathology at Stanford.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nShe worked closely with [[Philip Caves]] at [[Norman Shumway]]'s cardiac transplantation unit, where they developed the technique for assessing and monitoring acute organ rejection following heart transplant surgery. Serial biopsies, taken from transplanted hearts within the recipients, were taken using a newly developed [[bioptome]], percutaneous transvenous [[endomyocardial]] biopsy. The histological samples were examined in the pathology laboratories for early signs of rejection, allowing early treatment interventions.<ref name=\":1\" /> The timing of her work coincided with the excitement in early heart transplant surgery, with Norman Shumway performing the first heart transplant in the USA in 1968.<ref name=\":2\" /> She was at Stanford at a time when Stanford was leading cardiac transplantation research on an international platform and when places like Stanford had relatively few leading female scientists.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThe grading system was soon adopted as the standard method for examining rejection and other cardiac diseases.

In the biblical narrative, [[God in Abrahamic religions|God]] tells [[Abraham]] to [[human sacrifice|sacrifice]] his son, [[Isaac]], on [[Moriah]]. Abraham begins to comply, when a messenger from God interrupts him. Abraham then sees a ram and sacrifices it instead.\n\nThis episode has been the focus of a great deal of commentary in traditional Jewish, Christian, and Muslim sources, as well as being addressed by modern scholarship.\n\n==Biblical narrative==\n\n[[File:El sacrificio de Isaac (Domenichino).jpg|thumbnail| God commands Abraham to offer his son Isaac as a sacrifice, [[Domenichino]]]]\nAccording to the Hebrew Bible, God commands Abraham to offer his son Isaac as a sacrifice.{{Bibleref2c|Gen|22:2-8|}} After Isaac is bound to an [[altar]], a [[Angel of the Lord|messenger from God]]  stops Abraham before the sacrifice finishes, saying \"now I know you fear God.\"  Abraham looks up and sees a [[sheep|ram]] and sacrifices it instead of Isaac.\n\n[[File:Rembrandt Abraham en Isaac, 1634.jpg|thumb|''Abraham and Isaac'' (oil on canvas), [[Rembrandt]], 1634]]\n\nThe passage states that the event occurred at \"the mount of the {{LORD}}\"<ref>{{bibleverse|Genesis|22:14}}</ref> in \"the land of Moriah.\"<ref>{{bibleverse|Genesis|22:2}}</ref> [[Books of Chronicles|2 Chronicles]] {{Bibleverse-nb|2 Chronicles|3:1}} refers to \"mount Moriah\" as the site of Solomon's Temple, while [[Psalms]] {{bibleverse-nb||psalms|24:3|HE}}; [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] {{bibleverse-nb||isaiah|2:3|HE}} & {{bibleverse-nb||isaiah|30:29|HE}}; and [[Book of Zechariah|Zechariah]] {{bibleverse-nb||zechariah|8:3|HE}} use the term \"the mount of the LORD\" to refer to the site of Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem, the location believed to be the [[Temple Mount]] in Jerusalem.\n\n==Jewish views==\n[[File:Beit alfa02.jpg|thumb|Mosaic on the floor of [[Beth Alpha]] depicting the ''Akedah'']]\nIn ''The Binding of Isaac, Religious Murders & Kabbalah'', Lippman Bodoff argues that Abraham never intended to actually sacrifice his son, and that he had faith that God had no intention that he do so. Rabbi Ari Kahn (on the Orthodox Union website) elaborates this view as follows: Isaac's death was never a possibility \u2014 not as far as Abraham was concerned, and not as far as God was concerned. God's commandment to Abraham was very specific, and Abraham understood it very precisely: Isaac was to be \"raised up as an offering\", and God would use the opportunity to teach humankind, once and for all, that human sacrifice, child sacrifice, is not acceptable. This is precisely how the sages of the [[Talmud]] (Taanit 4a) understood the ''Akedah''. Citing the Prophet Jeremiah's exhortation against child sacrifice (Chapter 19), they state unequivocally that such behavior \"never crossed God\u2019s mind\", referring specifically to the sacrificial slaughter of Isaac. Though readers of this [[parashah]] throughout the generations have been disturbed, even horrified, by the Akedah, there was no miscommunication between God and Abraham. The thought of actually killing Isaac never crossed their minds.<ref>Rabbi Ari Kahn. \"[http://www.ou.org/torah/parsha/rabbi-ari-kahn-on-parsha/never-crossed-mind/ It Never Crossed My Mind]\".</ref>\n\nThe Jewish Publication Society suggests Abraham's apparent complicity with the sacrifice was actually his way of testing God. Abraham had previously argued with God to save lives in [[Sodom and Gomorrah]]. By silently complying with God's instructions to kill Isaac, Abraham was putting pressure on God to act in a moral way to preserve life. More evidence that Abraham thought that he would not actually sacrifice Isaac comes from Genesis 22:5, where Abraham said to his servants, \"You stay here with the ass. The boy and I will go up there; we will worship and we will return to you.\" By saying we (as opposed to I), he meant that both he and Isaac would return. Thus, he did not believe that Isaac would be sacrificed in the end.<ref>''Hebrew-English TANAKH.'', Page 39, The Jewish Publication Society, 1999</ref>\n\nIn ''[[The Guide for the Perplexed]]'', [[Maimonides]] argues that the story of the Binding of Isaac contains two \"great notions\". First, Abraham's willingness to sacrifice Isaac demonstrates the limit of humanity's capability to both love and fear God. Second, because Abraham acted on a prophetic vision of what God had asked him to do, the story exemplifies how prophetic revelation has the same [[truth value]] as philosophical argument and thus carries equal certainty, notwithstanding the fact that it comes in a dream or vision.<ref>Maimonides. ''The Guide of the Perplexed'', Vol. 2, Book III, Ch. 24. English translation by Shlomo Pines. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1963.</ref>\n\nIn ''Glory and Agony: Isaac's Sacrifice and National Narrative'', [[Yael S. Feldman]] argues that the story of Isaac's Binding, in both its biblical and post-biblical versions (the [[New Testament]] included) has had a great impact on the ethos of [[Altruism|altruist]] heroism and [[self-sacrifice]] in modern Hebrew national culture. As her study demonstrates, over the last century the \"Binding of Isaac\" has morphed into the \"Sacrifice of Isaac\", connoting both the glory and agony of heroic death on the battlefield.<ref>{{cite book|last=Feldman|first=Yael S.|title=Glory and Agony: Isaac's Sacrifice and National Narrative|year=2010|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, California|isbn=978-0-8047-5902-1}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Legends of the Jews]]'', rabbi [[Louis Ginzberg]] argues that the binding of Isaac is a way of God to test Isaac's claim to Ishmael, and to silence Satan's protest about Abraham who had not brought up any offering to God after Isaac was born,{{sfn|Ginzberg|1909}} also to show a proof to the world that Abraham is the true god-fearing man who is ready to fulfill any of God's commands, even to sacrifice his own son:\n{{quote|When God commanded the father to desist from sacrificing Isaac, Abraham said: \"One man tempts another, because he knoweth not what is in the heart of his neighbor.

Early Christian preaching sometimes accepted Jewish interpretations of the binding of Isaac without elaborating. For example, [[Hippolytus of Rome]] says in his ''Commentary on the Song of Songs'', \"The blessed Isaac became desirous of the anointing and he wished to sacrifice himself for the sake of the world\" (''On the Song'' 2:15).<ref>See Yancy Smith, \"Hippolytus' Commentary On the Song of Songs in Social and Critical Context\" (Unpublished PhD Dissertation; Brite Divinity School, 2008), 312.</ref>\n\nOther Christians from the period saw Isaac as a type of the \"Word of God\" who prefigured Christ.<ref>Origen, ''Homilies on Genesis'' 11\u201313</ref> This interpretation can be supported by symbolism and context such as Abraham sacrificing his son on the third day of the journey (Genesis 22:4), or Abraham taking the wood and putting it on his son Isaac's shoulder (Genesis 22:6). Another thing to note is how God reemphasizes Isaac being his one and only son whom he loves (Genesis 22:2,12,16).{{npsn|date=September 2018}}  As further support that the Binding of Isaac foretells the Gospel of Jesus Christ, when the two went up there, Isaac asked Abraham \"where is the lamb for the burnt offering\" to which Abraham responded \"God himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering, my son.\" (Genesis 22:7-8).  However, it was a Ram (not a Lamb) that was ultimately sacrificed in Isaac's place, and the Ram was caught in a thicket (i.e. thornbush). (Genesis 22:13).  In the New Testament, John the Baptist saw Jesus coming toward him and said \"Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sins of the world!\" (John 1:29).\n\n==Muslim views==\n[[File:Timurid_Anthology_Zhertva.jpg|thumb|Ibrahim's Sacrifice. Timurid Anthology, 1410\u201311.]]\nThe version in the [[Quran]] differs from that in Genesis in two aspects: the identity of the sacrificed son and the son's reaction towards the requested sacrifice. \nIn Islamic sources, when [[Abraham in Islam|Abraham]] tells his son about the vision, his son agreed to be sacrificed for the fulfillment of God's command, and no binding to the altar occurred. The Quran states that when Abraham asked for a righteous son, God granted him a son possessing forbearance. When the son was able to walk and work with him, Abraham saw a vision about sacrificing his son, Ishmael. When he told his son about it, his son agreed to fulfill the command of God in the vision. When they both had submitted their will to God and were ready for the sacrifice, God told Abraham he had fulfilled the vision, and provided him with a ram to sacrifice instead. God promised to reward Abraham.<ref>{{cite quran|37|100|end=111|style=ref}}</ref> The next two verses state God also granted Abraham the righteous son [[Isaac in Islam|Isaac]] and promised more rewards.<ref>{{cite quran|37|112|end=113|style=ref}}</ref>\n\nAmong early Muslim scholars, there was a dispute over the identity of the son. One side of the argument believed it was Isaac rather than Ishmael (notably [[ibn Qutaybah]] and [[al-Tabari]]) interpreting the verse \"God's perfecting his mercy on Abraham and Isaac\" as referring to his making Abraham his closest one, and to his rescuing Isaac. The other side, by far a vast majority, held that the promise to Sarah was of a son, Isaac, and a grandson, Jacob (Sura 11:71&ndash;74) excluded the possibility of a premature death of Isaac. Regardless, most Muslims believe that it is actually [[Ishmael in Islam|Ishmael]] rather than Isaac despite the dispute.<ref name=\"EoI_Ishaq\">''[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]'', ''Ishaq''.</ref>\n\nThe submission of Abraham and his son is celebrated and commemorated by Muslims on the days of [[Eid al-Adha]]. During the festival, those who can afford and the ones in the pilgrimage sacrifice a ram, cow, sheep or a camel. Part of the sacrifice meat is eaten by the household and remaining is distributed to the neighbors and the needy. The festival marks the end of the [[Hajj]] pilgrimage to [[Mecca]].\n\nIn Islam, the site of [[Al-Safa and Al-Marwah|al-Marwah]] near the [[Kaaba]] which rhymes with the Moriah mentioned in the [[Book of Genesis]].\n\n==Modern research==\n===Redactors and narrative purpose===\n[[Historical criticism|Modern scholars]] operating under the framework of the [[documentary hypothesis]] commonly ascribe the Binding's narrative to the [[Documentary hypothesis|biblical source E]], on the grounds that it generally uses the specific term [[Elohim]] ({{lang|he|\u05d0\u05dc\u05d5\u05d4\u05d9\u05dd}}) and parallels characteristic E compositions. On that view, the second angelic appearance to Abraham (v.&nbsp;14\u201318), praising his obedience and blessing his offspring, is in fact a later [[Jahwist]] interpolation to E's original account (v.&nbsp;1&ndash;13, 19). This is supported by the style and composition of these verses, as well as by the use of the name [[Yahweh]] for the deity.<ref name=\"WenhamGenesis\">G. J. Wenham. (1994). ''Genesis&nbsp;16-50''. Dallas, TX: Word Biblical Commentary.</ref>\n\nIn ''Mimesis: The Representation of Reality in Western Literature'', the literary critic [[Erich Auerbach]] considers the Hebrew narrative of the Binding of Isaac, along with Homer's description of Odysseus's scar, as the two [[paradigm]]atic models for the representation of [[reality]] in [[literature]]. Auerbach contrasts Homer's attention to detail and foregrounding of the spatial, historical, as well as personal contexts for events to the Bible's sparse account, in which virtually all context is kept in the background or left outside of the narrative. As Auerbach observes, this narrative strategy virtually compels readers to add their own interpretations to the text.\n\n===Ethical responsibility===\nMore recent studies question the analysis of E and J as strictly separate. Coats argues that Abraham's obedience to God's command in fact necessitates praise and blessing, which he only receives in the second angelic speech.<ref>Coats, G.W. (1973). Abraham's sacrifice of faith: A form critical study of Genesis&nbsp;22. ''Interpretation'', ''27'', pp.&nbsp;389\u2013400.</ref> That speech, therefore, could not have been simply inserted into E's original account. This has suggested to many that the author responsible for the interpolation of the second angelic appearance has left his mark also on the original account (v.&nbsp;1&ndash;13, 19).<ref name=\"WenhamGenesis\" />\n\nMore recently it has been suggested that these traces are in fact the first angelic appearance (v.&nbsp;11\u201312), in which the Angel of YHWH stops Abraham before he kills Isaac.<ref>Boehm, O. (2002). The binding of Isaac: An inner Biblical polemic on the question of disobeying a manifestly illegal order. ''[[Vetus Testamentum]]'', ''52''&nbsp;(1) pp.&nbsp;1\u201312.</ref> The style and composition of these verses resemble that of the second angelic speech, and YHWH is used for the deity rather than [[Names of God in Judaism#El|God]]. On that reading, in the original E version of the Binding Abraham disobeys God's command, sacrificing the ram \"''instead of his son''\" (v.&nbsp;13) on his own responsibility and without being stopped by an angel: \"''And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son; but Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and beheld, behind him was a ram, caught in a thicket by his horns; and Abraham went, and took the ram, and offered it up as a burnt offering instead of his son''\" (v.&nbsp;10, 13).\n\nBy interpolating the first appearance of the angel, a later redactor shifted responsibility for halting the test from Abraham to the angel (v.&nbsp;11\u201312). The second angelic appearance, in which Abraham is rewarded for his obedience (v.&nbsp;14\u201318), became necessary due to that shift of responsibility. This analysis of the story sheds light on the connection between the Binding and the story of [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]] ({{bibleverse-lb||Genesis|18|NIV}}), in which Abraham protests against God's unethical plan to destroy the city, without distinguishing between the righteous and the wicked: \"''Far be it from you to do such a thing: Shall not the judge of all the earth do what is just?''\" Abraham's ethical rebellion against God in the destruction of Sodom culminates in his disobedience to God, refusing to sacrifice Isaac.<ref>O. Boehm, O. (2007). ''The Binding of Isaac: A Religious Model of Disobedience'', New York, NY: T&T Clark.</ref>\n\nThe Binding also figures prominently in the writings of several of the more important modern [[Theology|theologians]], such as [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]] in ''[[Fear and Trembling]]'' and Shalom Spiegel in ''The Last Trial''. Jewish communities regularly review this literature, for instance the recent [[mock trial]] held by more than 600&nbsp;members of the University Synagogue of [[Orange County, California]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Bird|first=Cameron|title=For 'jury', a case of biblical proportions|work=[[The Orange County Register]]|volume=105|issue=12|page=11|date=12 January 2009}}</ref> [[Jacques Derrida|Derrida]] also looks at the story of the sacrifice as well as [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard's]] reading in ''The Gift of Death''.\n\n===Possible child sacrifice===\n[[File:Icelandic Isaac sacrifice.jpg|thumb|From a 14th-century Icelandic manuscript of [[Stj\u00f3rn]]]]\n[[File:Abraham about to sacrifice Isaac.jpg|thumb|Abraham about to sacrifice Isaac. From a 14th-century English [[Missal]]]]\n\n[[Francesca Stavrakopoulou]] has speculated that it is possible that the story \"''contains traces of a tradition in which Abraham does sacrifice Isaac''.<ref>''It may be that the biblical story contains traces of a tradition in which Abraham does sacrifice Isaac, for in Genesis&nbsp;22:19 Abraham appears to return from the mountain without Isaac''.

''King Manasseh and child sacrifice: Biblical distortions of historical realities'', pp.&nbsp;193&ndash;194.</ref> [[Richard Elliott Friedman|R.E. Friedman]] argued that in the original E story, Abraham may have carried out the sacrifice of Isaac, but that later repugnance at the idea of a human sacrifice led the redactor of JE to add the lines in which a ram is substituted for Isaac.<ref>[[Richard Elliott Friedman|Friedman, R.E.]] (2003). ''The Bible With Sources Revealed'', p.&nbsp;65.</ref> Likewise, Terence Fretheim wrote that ''the text bears no specific mark of being a polemic against child sacrifice''.<ref>Terence E Fretheim in ''The Child in the Bible'' edited by [[Marcia Bunge|Marcia J. Bunge]], Terence E. Fretheim, [[Beverly Roberts Gaventa]], pg.&nbsp;20</ref>\n\nSome scholars also point at the [[Genealogies in the Bible|genealogical snippet]] (verses&nbsp;20&ndash;24) as containing a hint to the question whether Abraham sacrificed Isaac or not.\n\n*First of all, the description of a rash of newborns placed right after the main story suggests the existence of some direct cause-effect connection between the two. From the perspective of a sacrificial economy, such a numerous progeny could not have been conceived without the preceding payment in an appropriate \u2018currency\u2019.\n*Secondly, the said passage is problematic due to its [[Onomastics|onomastic]] content. The verses&nbsp;20&ndash;23 list the progeny of Nahor and Milkah while v.&nbsp;24 adds the offspring conceived with Re\u2019umah, said to be his concubine.\n\nHowever, whereas verses&nbsp;20&ndash;23 have some significant links with other parts of the Hebrew Bible as well as with the historical and cultural entourage of the ancient Near East, such connections are absent in v.&nbsp;24. The very name of Nahor's concubine appears here exclusively and in no other place in the Hebrew Bible is Re\u2019umah mentioned. The same applies to her children's names with the exception of Ma\u2018akah which is sometimes utilized in the historical books. The extreme rarity of these appellations demands some alternative interpretation with regards to its purpose.\n\nContradictory, the Hebrew name list of the children born after the sacrifice, may contain some \"coded\" explanation refuting any possible child sacrifice:\n*Re\u2019umah (\u05e8\u05d0\u05d5\u05de\u05d4) \u2013 \"see what\"\n*Tevah (\u05d8\u05d1\u05d7) \u2013 \"slaughtering of animal\" or \"slaughtered animal\"<ref name=\"sefaria.org\">https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.22.24?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en</ref>\n*Gaham (\u05d2\u05d7\u05dd) \u2013 \"flame\" or \"burning\"\n*Tahash (\u05ea\u05d7\u05e9) \u2013 \"animal skin\" <ref name=\"sefaria.org\"/>\n*Ma\u2018akah (\u05de\u05e2\u05db\u05d4) \u2013 \"blown\" or \"crushed\"\nIn other words, v.&nbsp;24 begins with an interpretational invitation and continues with the names which seem to explain the cause of the rash of newborns present at the conclusion of the pericope: An animal had been blown, slaughtered, put on the tabernacle, and burned.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kosior|first1=Wojciech|title=\"You have not withheld your son, your only one, from Me\".

Abraham begins to comply, when a messenger from God interrupts him. Abraham then sees a ram and sacrifices it instead.\n\nThis episode has been the focus of a great deal of commentary in traditional Jewish, Christian, and Muslim sources, as well as being addressed by modern scholarship.\n\n==Biblical narrative==\n\n[[File:El sacrificio de Isaac (Domenichino).jpg|thumbnail| God commands Abraham to offer his son Isaac as a sacrifice, [[Domenichino]]]]\nAccording to the Hebrew Bible, God commands Abraham to offer his son Isaac as a sacrifice.{{Bibleref2c|Gen|22:2-8|}} After Isaac is bound to an [[altar]], a [[Angel of the Lord|messenger from God]]  stops Abraham before the sacrifice finishes, saying \"now I know you fear God.\"  Abraham looks up and sees a [[sheep|ram]] and sacrifices it instead of Isaac.\n\n[[File:Rembrandt Abraham en Isaac, 1634.jpg|thumb|''Abraham and Isaac'' (oil on canvas), [[Rembrandt]], 1634]]\n\nThe passage states that the event occurred at \"the mount of the {{LORD}}\"<ref>{{bibleverse|Genesis|22:14}}</ref> in \"the land of Moriah.\"<ref>{{bibleverse|Genesis|22:2}}</ref> [[Books of Chronicles|2 Chronicles]] {{Bibleverse-nb|2 Chronicles|3:1}} refers to \"mount Moriah\" as the site of Solomon's Temple, while [[Psalms]] {{bibleverse-nb||psalms|24:3|HE}}; [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] {{bibleverse-nb||isaiah|2:3|HE}} & {{bibleverse-nb||isaiah|30:29|HE}}; and [[Book of Zechariah|Zechariah]] {{bibleverse-nb||zechariah|8:3|HE}} use the term \"the mount of the LORD\" to refer to the site of Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem, the location believed to be the [[Temple Mount]] in Jerusalem.\n\n==Jewish views==\n[[File:Beit alfa02.jpg|thumb|Mosaic on the floor of [[Beth Alpha]] depicting the ''Akedah'']]\nIn ''The Binding of Isaac, Religious Murders & Kabbalah'', Lippman Bodoff argues that Abraham never intended to actually sacrifice his son, and that he had faith that God had no intention that he do so. Rabbi Ari Kahn (on the Orthodox Union website) elaborates this view as follows: Isaac's death was never a possibility \u2014 not as far as Abraham was concerned, and not as far as God was concerned. God's commandment to Abraham was very specific, and Abraham understood it very precisely: Isaac was to be \"raised up as an offering\", and God would use the opportunity to teach humankind, once and for all, that human sacrifice, child sacrifice, is not acceptable. This is precisely how the sages of the [[Talmud]] (Taanit 4a) understood the ''Akedah''. Citing the Prophet Jeremiah's exhortation against child sacrifice (Chapter 19), they state unequivocally that such behavior \"never crossed God\u2019s mind\", referring specifically to the sacrificial slaughter of Isaac. Though readers of this [[parashah]] throughout the generations have been disturbed, even horrified, by the Akedah, there was no miscommunication between God and Abraham. The thought of actually killing Isaac never crossed their minds.<ref>Rabbi Ari Kahn. \"[http://www.ou.org/torah/parsha/rabbi-ari-kahn-on-parsha/never-crossed-mind/ It Never Crossed My Mind]\".</ref>\n\nThe Jewish Publication Society suggests Abraham's apparent complicity with the sacrifice was actually his way of testing God. Abraham had previously argued with God to save lives in [[Sodom and Gomorrah]]. By silently complying with God's instructions to kill Isaac, Abraham was putting pressure on God to act in a moral way to preserve life. More evidence that Abraham thought that he would not actually sacrifice Isaac comes from Genesis 22:5, where Abraham said to his servants, \"You stay here with the ass. The boy and I will go up there; we will worship and we will return to you.\" By saying we (as opposed to I), he meant that both he and Isaac would return. Thus, he did not believe that Isaac would be sacrificed in the end.<ref>''Hebrew-English TANAKH.'', Page 39, The Jewish Publication Society, 1999</ref>\n\nIn ''[[The Guide for the Perplexed]]'', [[Maimonides]] argues that the story of the Binding of Isaac contains two \"great notions\". First, Abraham's willingness to sacrifice Isaac demonstrates the limit of humanity's capability to both love and fear God. Second, because Abraham acted on a prophetic vision of what God had asked him to do, the story exemplifies how prophetic revelation has the same [[truth value]] as philosophical argument and thus carries equal certainty, notwithstanding the fact that it comes in a dream or vision.<ref>Maimonides.

Feldman]] argues that the story of Isaac's Binding, in both its biblical and post-biblical versions (the [[New Testament]] included) has had a great impact on the ethos of [[Altruism|altruist]] heroism and [[self-sacrifice]] in modern Hebrew national culture. As her study demonstrates, over the last century the \"Binding of Isaac\" has morphed into the \"Sacrifice of Isaac\", connoting both the glory and agony of heroic death on the battlefield.<ref>{{cite book|last=Feldman|first=Yael S.|title=Glory and Agony: Isaac's Sacrifice and National Narrative|year=2010|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, California|isbn=978-0-8047-5902-1}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Legends of the Jews]]'', rabbi [[Louis Ginzberg]] argues that the binding of Isaac is a way of God to test Isaac's claim to Ishmael, and to silence Satan's protest about Abraham who had not brought up any offering to God after Isaac was born,{{sfn|Ginzberg|1909}} also to show a proof to the world that Abraham is the true god-fearing man who is ready to fulfill any of God's commands, even to sacrifice his own son:\n{{quote|When God commanded the father to desist from sacrificing Isaac, Abraham said: \"One man tempts another, because he knoweth not what is in the heart of his neighbor.

Levenson]] notes that they never speak before the binding, either.<ref name=\"Levenson 2012 p. 59\">{{cite book | last=Levenson | first=J.D. | title=Inheriting Abraham: The Legacy of the Patriarch in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam | publisher=Princeton University Press | series=Library of Jewish Ideas | year=2012 | isbn=978-1-4008-4461-6 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5veRUqfcuNQC&pg=PT59| page=59}}</ref>\n\n==Christian views==\n[[File:Adi Holzer Werksverzeichnis 835 Abrahams Opfer.jpg|thumb|right|''Sacrifice of Isaac'', by [[Adi Holzer]], 1997]]\nThe Binding of Isaac is mentioned in the [[New Testament]] [[Epistle to the Hebrews]] among many acts of faith recorded in the [[Old Testament]]: \"By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises offered up his only begotten son, of whom it was said, 'In Isaac your seed shall be called,' concluding that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead, from which he also received him in a figurative sense.\" (Hebrews 11:17\u201319, NKJV)\n\nAbraham's faith in God is such that he felt God would be able to resurrect the slain Isaac, in order that his prophecy (Genesis 21:12) might be fulfilled. Early Christian preaching sometimes accepted Jewish interpretations of the binding of Isaac without elaborating. For example, [[Hippolytus of Rome]] says in his ''Commentary on the Song of Songs'', \"The blessed Isaac became desirous of the anointing and he wished to sacrifice himself for the sake of the world\" (''On the Song'' 2:15).<ref>See Yancy Smith, \"Hippolytus' Commentary On the Song of Songs in Social and Critical Context\" (Unpublished PhD Dissertation; Brite Divinity School, 2008), 312.</ref>\n\nOther Christians from the period saw Isaac as a type of the \"Word of God\" who prefigured Christ.<ref>Origen, ''Homilies on Genesis'' 11\u201313</ref> This interpretation can be supported by symbolism and context such as Abraham sacrificing his son on the third day of the journey (Genesis 22:4), or Abraham taking the wood and putting it on his son Isaac's shoulder (Genesis 22:6). Another thing to note is how God reemphasizes Isaac being his one and only son whom he loves (Genesis 22:2,12,16).{{npsn|date=September 2018}}  As further support that the Binding of Isaac foretells the Gospel of Jesus Christ, when the two went up there, Isaac asked Abraham \"where is the lamb for the burnt offering\" to which Abraham responded \"God himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering, my son.\" (Genesis 22:7-8).  However, it was a Ram (not a Lamb) that was ultimately sacrificed in Isaac's place, and the Ram was caught in a thicket (i.e. thornbush). (Genesis 22:13).  In the New Testament, John the Baptist saw Jesus coming toward him and said \"Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sins of the world!\" (John 1:29).\n\n==Muslim views==\n[[File:Timurid_Anthology_Zhertva.jpg|thumb|Ibrahim's Sacrifice. Timurid Anthology, 1410\u201311.]]\nThe version in the [[Quran]] differs from that in Genesis in two aspects: the identity of the sacrificed son and the son's reaction towards the requested sacrifice. \nIn Islamic sources, when [[Abraham in Islam|Abraham]] tells his son about the vision, his son agreed to be sacrificed for the fulfillment of God's command, and no binding to the altar occurred. The Quran states that when Abraham asked for a righteous son, God granted him a son possessing forbearance. When the son was able to walk and work with him, Abraham saw a vision about sacrificing his son, Ishmael. When he told his son about it, his son agreed to fulfill the command of God in the vision. When they both had submitted their will to God and were ready for the sacrifice, God told Abraham he had fulfilled the vision, and provided him with a ram to sacrifice instead. God promised to reward Abraham.<ref>{{cite quran|37|100|end=111|style=ref}}</ref> The next two verses state God also granted Abraham the righteous son [[Isaac in Islam|Isaac]] and promised more rewards.<ref>{{cite quran|37|112|end=113|style=ref}}</ref>\n\nAmong early Muslim scholars, there was a dispute over the identity of the son. One side of the argument believed it was Isaac rather than Ishmael (notably [[ibn Qutaybah]] and [[al-Tabari]]) interpreting the verse \"God's perfecting his mercy on Abraham and Isaac\" as referring to his making Abraham his closest one, and to his rescuing Isaac. The other side, by far a vast majority, held that the promise to Sarah was of a son, Isaac, and a grandson, Jacob (Sura 11:71&ndash;74) excluded the possibility of a premature death of Isaac. Regardless, most Muslims believe that it is actually [[Ishmael in Islam|Ishmael]] rather than Isaac despite the dispute.<ref name=\"EoI_Ishaq\">''[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]'', ''Ishaq''.</ref>\n\nThe submission of Abraham and his son is celebrated and commemorated by Muslims on the days of [[Eid al-Adha]]. During the festival, those who can afford and the ones in the pilgrimage sacrifice a ram, cow, sheep or a camel. Part of the sacrifice meat is eaten by the household and remaining is distributed to the neighbors and the needy. The festival marks the end of the [[Hajj]] pilgrimage to [[Mecca]].\n\nIn Islam, the site of [[Al-Safa and Al-Marwah|al-Marwah]] near the [[Kaaba]] which rhymes with the Moriah mentioned in the [[Book of Genesis]].\n\n==Modern research==\n===Redactors and narrative purpose===\n[[Historical criticism|Modern scholars]] operating under the framework of the [[documentary hypothesis]] commonly ascribe the Binding's narrative to the [[Documentary hypothesis|biblical source E]], on the grounds that it generally uses the specific term [[Elohim]] ({{lang|he|\u05d0\u05dc\u05d5\u05d4\u05d9\u05dd}}) and parallels characteristic E compositions. On that view, the second angelic appearance to Abraham (v.&nbsp;14\u201318), praising his obedience and blessing his offspring, is in fact a later [[Jahwist]] interpolation to E's original account (v.&nbsp;1&ndash;13, 19). This is supported by the style and composition of these verses, as well as by the use of the name [[Yahweh]] for the deity.<ref name=\"WenhamGenesis\">G. J. Wenham. (1994). ''Genesis&nbsp;16-50''. Dallas, TX: Word Biblical Commentary.</ref>\n\nIn ''Mimesis: The Representation of Reality in Western Literature'', the literary critic [[Erich Auerbach]] considers the Hebrew narrative of the Binding of Isaac, along with Homer's description of Odysseus's scar, as the two [[paradigm]]atic models for the representation of [[reality]] in [[literature]]. Auerbach contrasts Homer's attention to detail and foregrounding of the spatial, historical, as well as personal contexts for events to the Bible's sparse account, in which virtually all context is kept in the background or left outside of the narrative. As Auerbach observes, this narrative strategy virtually compels readers to add their own interpretations to the text.\n\n===Ethical responsibility===\nMore recent studies question the analysis of E and J as strictly separate. Coats argues that Abraham's obedience to God's command in fact necessitates praise and blessing, which he only receives in the second angelic speech.<ref>Coats, G.W. (1973). Abraham's sacrifice of faith: A form critical study of Genesis&nbsp;22. ''Interpretation'', ''27'', pp.&nbsp;389\u2013400.</ref> That speech, therefore, could not have been simply inserted into E's original account. This has suggested to many that the author responsible for the interpolation of the second angelic appearance has left his mark also on the original account (v.&nbsp;1&ndash;13, 19).<ref name=\"WenhamGenesis\" />\n\nMore recently it has been suggested that these traces are in fact the first angelic appearance (v.&nbsp;11\u201312), in which the Angel of YHWH stops Abraham before he kills Isaac.<ref>Boehm, O. (2002). The binding of Isaac: An inner Biblical polemic on the question of disobeying a manifestly illegal order. ''[[Vetus Testamentum]]'', ''52''&nbsp;(1) pp.&nbsp;1\u201312.</ref> The style and composition of these verses resemble that of the second angelic speech, and YHWH is used for the deity rather than [[Names of God in Judaism#El|God]]. On that reading, in the original E version of the Binding Abraham disobeys God's command, sacrificing the ram \"''instead of his son''\" (v.&nbsp;13) on his own responsibility and without being stopped by an angel: \"''And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son; but Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and beheld, behind him was a ram, caught in a thicket by his horns; and Abraham went, and took the ram, and offered it up as a burnt offering instead of his son''\" (v.&nbsp;10, 13).\n\nBy interpolating the first appearance of the angel, a later redactor shifted responsibility for halting the test from Abraham to the angel (v.&nbsp;11\u201312). The second angelic appearance, in which Abraham is rewarded for his obedience (v.&nbsp;14\u201318), became necessary due to that shift of responsibility. This analysis of the story sheds light on the connection between the Binding and the story of [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]] ({{bibleverse-lb||Genesis|18|NIV}}), in which Abraham protests against God's unethical plan to destroy the city, without distinguishing between the righteous and the wicked: \"''Far be it from you to do such a thing: Shall not the judge of all the earth do what is just?''\" Abraham's ethical rebellion against God in the destruction of Sodom culminates in his disobedience to God, refusing to sacrifice Isaac.<ref>O. Boehm, O. (2007). ''The Binding of Isaac: A Religious Model of Disobedience'', New York, NY: T&T Clark.</ref>\n\nThe Binding also figures prominently in the writings of several of the more important modern [[Theology|theologians]], such as [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]] in ''[[Fear and Trembling]]'' and Shalom Spiegel in ''The Last Trial''. Jewish communities regularly review this literature, for instance the recent [[mock trial]] held by more than 600&nbsp;members of the University Synagogue of [[Orange County, California]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Bird|first=Cameron|title=For 'jury', a case of biblical proportions|work=[[The Orange County Register]]|volume=105|issue=12|page=11|date=12 January 2009}}</ref> [[Jacques Derrida|Derrida]] also looks at the story of the sacrifice as well as [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard's]] reading in ''The Gift of Death''.\n\n===Possible child sacrifice===\n[[File:Icelandic Isaac sacrifice.jpg|thumb|From a 14th-century Icelandic manuscript of [[Stj\u00f3rn]]]]\n[[File:Abraham about to sacrifice Isaac.jpg|thumb|Abraham about to sacrifice Isaac. From a 14th-century English [[Missal]]]]\n\n[[Francesca Stavrakopoulou]] has speculated that it is possible that the story \"''contains traces of a tradition in which Abraham does sacrifice Isaac''.<ref>''It may be that the biblical story contains traces of a tradition in which Abraham does sacrifice Isaac, for in Genesis&nbsp;22:19 Abraham appears to return from the mountain without Isaac''. [[Francesca Stavrakopoulou|Stavrakopoulou, F.]] (2004). ''King Manasseh and child sacrifice: Biblical distortions of historical realities'', pp.&nbsp;193&ndash;194.</ref> [[Richard Elliott Friedman|R.E. Friedman]] argued that in the original E story, Abraham may have carried out the sacrifice of Isaac, but that later repugnance at the idea of a human sacrifice led the redactor of JE to add the lines in which a ram is substituted for Isaac.<ref>[[Richard Elliott Friedman|Friedman, R.E.]] (2003). ''The Bible With Sources Revealed'', p.&nbsp;65.</ref> Likewise, Terence Fretheim wrote that ''the text bears no specific mark of being a polemic against child sacrifice''.<ref>Terence E Fretheim in ''The Child in the Bible'' edited by [[Marcia Bunge|Marcia J. Bunge]], Terence E. Fretheim, [[Beverly Roberts Gaventa]], pg.&nbsp;20</ref>\n\nSome scholars also point at the [[Genealogies in the Bible|genealogical snippet]] (verses&nbsp;20&ndash;24) as containing a hint to the question whether Abraham sacrificed Isaac or not.\n\n*First of all, the description of a rash of newborns placed right after the main story suggests the existence of some direct cause-effect connection between the two. From the perspective of a sacrificial economy, such a numerous progeny could not have been conceived without the preceding payment in an appropriate \u2018currency\u2019.\n*Secondly, the said passage is problematic due to its [[Onomastics|onomastic]] content. The verses&nbsp;20&ndash;23 list the progeny of Nahor and Milkah while v.&nbsp;24 adds the offspring conceived with Re\u2019umah, said to be his concubine.\n\nHowever, whereas verses&nbsp;20&ndash;23 have some significant links with other parts of the Hebrew Bible as well as with the historical and cultural entourage of the ancient Near East, such connections are absent in v.&nbsp;24. The very name of Nahor's concubine appears here exclusively and in no other place in the Hebrew Bible is Re\u2019umah mentioned. The same applies to her children's names with the exception of Ma\u2018akah which is sometimes utilized in the historical books. The extreme rarity of these appellations demands some alternative interpretation with regards to its purpose.\n\nContradictory, the Hebrew name list of the children born after the sacrifice, may contain some \"coded\" explanation refuting any possible child sacrifice:\n*Re\u2019umah (\u05e8\u05d0\u05d5\u05de\u05d4) \u2013 \"see what\"\n*Tevah (\u05d8\u05d1\u05d7) \u2013 \"slaughtering of animal\" or \"slaughtered animal\"<ref name=\"sefaria.org\">https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.22.24?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en</ref>\n*Gaham (\u05d2\u05d7\u05dd) \u2013 \"flame\" or \"burning\"\n*Tahash (\u05ea\u05d7\u05e9) \u2013 \"animal skin\" <ref name=\"sefaria.org\"/>\n*Ma\u2018akah (\u05de\u05e2\u05db\u05d4) \u2013 \"blown\" or \"crushed\"\nIn other words, v.&nbsp;24 begins with an interpretational invitation and continues with the names which seem to explain the cause of the rash of newborns present at the conclusion of the pericope: An animal had been blown, slaughtered, put on the tabernacle, and burned.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kosior|first1=Wojciech|title=\"You have not withheld your son, your only one, from Me\".
