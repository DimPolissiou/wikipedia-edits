Oudh, the now obsolete but once official English-language name of the state, also written historically as '''Oude''', derived from the name of [[Ayodhya]], its first capital.\n\nAs the [[Mughal Empire]] declined and decentralized, local governors in Oudh began asserting greater autonomy, and eventually Oudh matured into an independent polity governing the fertile lands of the Central and Lower [[Doab]]. With the [[British East India Company]] entering Bengal and decisively defeating Oudh at the [[Battle of Buxar]] in 1764, Oudh fell into the British orbit.\n\nThe capital of Oudh was in [[Faizabad]], but the British Agents, officially known as \"residents\", had their seat in [[Lucknow]]. The Nawab of Oudh, one of the richest princes, paid for and erected a [[Residencies of British India|Residency in Lucknow]] as a part of a wider programme of civic improvements.<ref>Davies, Philip, ''Splendours of the Raj: British Architecture in India, 1660\u20131947.''

In the course of this uprising detachments of the British Indian Army from the [[Bombay Presidency]] overcame the disunited collection of Indian states in a single rapid campaign. Determined rebels continued to wage sporadic guerrilla clashes until the spring of 1859.

In 1728, Oudh further acquired [[Varanasi]], [[Jaunpur, Uttar Pradesh|Jaunpur]] and surrounding lands from the Mughal noble [[Rustam Ali Khan]] and established stable revenue collection in that province after quelling the chief of [[Azamgarh]], [[Mahabat Khan]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Srivastava |first1=Ashirbadi Lal |title=The First Two Nawabs Of Oudh (a Critical Study Based On Original Sources) |date=1933 |publisher=The Upper India Publishing House, Ltd. |location=Lucknow |url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.49871/page/n1}}</ref>{{rp|44}} In 1739 Saadat Khan mobilized Oudh to defend against [[Nader Shah]]'s [[Nader Shah's invasion of the Mughal Empire|invasion of India]], ultimately being captured in the [[battle of Karnal]].

He continued Saadat Khan's expansionist policy, promising military protection to Bengal in exchange for the forts at [[Rohtasgarh]] and [[Chunar]], and annexing portions of [[Farrukhabad]] with Mughal military aid which was ruled by [[Muhammad Khan Bangash]].\n\nAs regional officials asserted their autonomy in [[Bengal]] and the [[Deccan]] as well as with the rise of the [[Maratha Empire]], the rulers of Oudh gradually affirmed their own sovereignty. [[Safdar Jang]] went as far as to control the ruler of Delhi, putting [[Ahmad Shah Bahadur]] on the Mughal throne with the cooperation of other Mughal nobility. In 1748 he gained the [[subah]] of [[Allahabad]] with Ahmad Shah's official support.

Primarily, the British sought to protect the frontiers of Bengal and their lucrative trade there; only later did direct expansion occur.\n\n====Shuja-ud-Daula====\n{{Also|Shuja-ud-Daula}}\nBritish dominance was established at the [[Battle of Buxar]] of 1764, when the East India Company defeated the alliance between the nawab of Oudh [[Shuja-ud-Daula]] and the deposed nawab of Bengal [[Mir Kasim]].<ref name=\"ramusack\">{{cite book|last1=Ramusack|first1=Barbara N.|title=The Indian Princes and their States|date=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}</ref>{{rp|25}} The battle was a turning point for the once rising star of Oudh. The immediate effect was British occupation of the fort at [[Chunar]] and the cession of the provinces of Kora and [[Allahabad]] to Mughal ruler [[Shah Alam II]] under the [[Treaty of Benares (1765)]].

The treaty also granted British traders special privileges and exemptions from many customs duties, which led to tensions as British monopolies were established.\n\nShuja-ud-Daula bought the Mughal provinces of Kora and Allahabad in [[Treaty of Benares (1773)]] with the British (who held ''de-facto'' control over the area) for 50 lakh rupees, increased cost of Company mercenaries, and military aid in the [[First Rohilla War]] to expand Oudh as a buffer state against Maratha interests.<ref name=\"ramusack\" />{{rp|65}}<ref name=\"grover\" />{{rp|75}} Done by [[Warren Hastings]], this move was unpopular among the rest of Company leadership, but Hastings continued a harsh policy on Oudh, justifying the military aid as a bid to strengthen Oudh's status as a buffer state against the Marathas. To shape the policy of Oudh and direct its internal affairs Hastings appointed the resident [[Nathaniel Middleton]] in Lucknow that year as well. At the conclusion of the First Rohilla War in 1774, Oudh gained the entirety of [[Rohilkhand]] and the Middle [[Doab]] region, only leaving the independent [[Rampur State]] as a Rohilla enclave.\n\n====Asaf-ud-Daula====\n{{Also|Asaf-ud-Daula}}\nAsaf-ud-Daula acceded to the nawabship of Oudh with British aid in exchange for the [[Treaty of Benares (1775)]] which further increased the cost of mercenaries and ceded the ''sarkars'' of [[Benares]], [[Ghazipur]], [[Chunar]], and [[Jaunpur, Uttar Pradesh|Jaunpur]].

A treaty signed on 21 February 1798 increased the subsidy paid to the British to 70 lakh rupees per year.<ref name=\"habib\"/>\n\nIn light of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and British demands for greater revenue from the Company, in 1801, [[Saadat Ali Khan II]] ceded the entire [[Rohilkhand]] and [[Lower Doab]] as well as the ''sarkar'' of [[Gorakhpur]] under the pressure of [[Lord Wellesley]] to the British in lieu of the annual tribute.<ref>Treaty with the Nawab of Oudh for cession of Territory in commutation of Subsidy, concluded by Henry Wellesley and Lieut.-Col. William Scott 10th Nov. 1801</ref> The cession halved the size of the polity, reducing it to the original Mughal [[subah]] of Awadh (excepting Gorakhpur which was ceded) and surrounded it by directly-administered British territory, rendering it useless as a buffer. The treaty also mandated a government to be put in place that primarily served the citizens of Oudh. It was on the basis of the failure to meet this demand that the British later justified the annexation of Oudh.\n\n[[Farrukhabad]] and [[Rampur State|Rampur]] were not annexed by the British yet; instead they served as separate princely states for the moment.<ref name=\"habib\"/>\n\nThe kingdom became a British [[protectorate]] in May 1816 (However, the state was an unofficial British protectorate since 1764, having little external autonomy). Three years later, in 1819, the [[Ghazi-ud-Din Haidar Shah]] took the title of ''padshah'' (king), signaling formal independence from the Mughal Empire under the advice of the [[Marquis of Hastings]].\n\nThroughout the early 1800s until annexation, several areas were gradually ceded to the British.\n\n===British annexation===\nOn 7 February 1856 by order of [[Lord Dalhousie]], General of the East India Company, the king of Oudh ([[Wajid Ali Shah]]) was deposed, and its kingdom was annexed to British India under the terms of the [[Doctrine of lapse]] on the grounds of alleged internal misrule.<ref name=igi-V-72/>\n\nBetween 5 July 1857 and 3 March 1858 there was an upheaval by the son of the deposed king joining the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]]. At the time of the rebellion, the British lost control of the territory; they reestablished their rule over the next eighteen months, during which time there were massacres such as those that had occurred in the course of the [[Siege of Cawnpore]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Ben Cahoon |url=http://www.worldstatesmen.org/India_princes_K-W.html#oudh |title=Princely States of India \u2013 Oudh |publisher=Worldstatesmen.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-08 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6Dyc4EETd?url=http://www.worldstatesmen.org/India_princes_K-W.html#oudh |archive-date=27 January 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>William Barton, ''The princes of India''.

Oudh, the now obsolete but once official English-language name of the state, also written historically as '''Oude''', derived from the name of [[Ayodhya]], its first capital.\n\nAs the [[Mughal Empire]] declined and decentralized, local governors in Oudh began asserting greater autonomy, and eventually Oudh matured into an independent polity governing the fertile lands of the Central and Lower [[Doab]]. With the [[British East India Company]] entering Bengal and decisively defeating Oudh at the [[Battle of Buxar]] in 1764, Oudh fell into the British orbit.\n\nThe capital of Oudh was in [[Faizabad]], but the British Agents, officially known as \"residents\", had their seat in [[Lucknow]].

In the course of this uprising detachments of the British Indian Army from the [[Bombay Presidency]] overcame the disunited collection of Indian states in a single rapid campaign.

In 1728, Oudh further acquired [[Varanasi]], [[Jaunpur, Uttar Pradesh|Jaunpur]] and surrounding lands from the Mughal noble [[Rustam Ali Khan]] and established stable revenue collection in that province after quelling the chief of [[Azamgarh]], [[Mahabat Khan]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Srivastava |first1=Ashirbadi Lal |title=The First Two Nawabs Of Oudh (a Critical Study Based On Original Sources) |date=1933 |publisher=The Upper India Publishing House, Ltd. |location=Lucknow |url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.49871/page/n1}}</ref>{{rp|44}} In 1739 Saadat Khan mobilized Oudh to defend against [[Nader Shah]]'s [[Nader Shah's invasion of the Mughal Empire|invasion of India]], ultimately being captured in the [[battle of Karnal]].

He continued Saadat Khan's expansionist policy, promising military protection to Bengal in exchange for the forts at [[Rohtasgarh]] and [[Chunar]], and annexing portions of [[Farrukhabad]] with Mughal military aid which was ruled by [[Muhammad Khan Bangash]].\n\nAs regional officials asserted their autonomy in [[Bengal]] and the [[Deccan]] as well as with the rise of the [[Maratha Empire]], the rulers of Oudh gradually affirmed their own sovereignty. [[Safdar Jang]] went as far as to control the ruler of Delhi, putting [[Ahmad Shah Bahadur]] on the Mughal throne with the cooperation of other Mughal nobility. In 1748 he gained the [[subah]] of [[Allahabad]] with Ahmad Shah's official support.

Primarily, the British sought to protect the frontiers of Bengal and their lucrative trade there; only later did direct expansion occur.\n\n====Shuja-ud-Daula====\n{{Also|Shuja-ud-Daula}}\nBritish dominance was established at the [[Battle of Buxar]] of 1764, when the East India Company defeated the alliance between the nawab of Oudh [[Shuja-ud-Daula]] and the deposed nawab of Bengal [[Mir Kasim]].<ref name=\"ramusack\">{{cite book|last1=Ramusack|first1=Barbara N.|title=The Indian Princes and their States|date=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}</ref>{{rp|25}} The battle was a turning point for the once rising star of Oudh. The immediate effect was British occupation of the fort at [[Chunar]] and the cession of the provinces of Kora and [[Allahabad]] to Mughal ruler [[Shah Alam II]] under the [[Treaty of Benares (1765)]].

The treaty also granted British traders special privileges and exemptions from many customs duties, which led to tensions as British monopolies were established.\n\nShuja-ud-Daula bought the Mughal provinces of Kora and Allahabad in [[Treaty of Benares (1773)]] with the British (who held ''de-facto'' control over the area) for 50 lakh rupees, increased cost of Company mercenaries, and military aid in the [[First Rohilla War]] to expand Oudh as a buffer state against Maratha interests.<ref name=\"ramusack\" />{{rp|65}}<ref name=\"grover\" />{{rp|75}} Done by [[Warren Hastings]], this move was unpopular among the rest of Company leadership, but Hastings continued a harsh policy on Oudh, justifying the military aid as a bid to strengthen Oudh's status as a buffer state against the Marathas. To shape the policy of Oudh and direct its internal affairs Hastings appointed the resident [[Nathaniel Middleton]] in Lucknow that year as well. At the conclusion of the First Rohilla War in 1774, Oudh gained the entirety of [[Rohilkhand]] and the Middle [[Doab]] region, only leaving the independent [[Rampur State]] as a Rohilla enclave.\n\n====Asaf-ud-Daula====\n{{Also|Asaf-ud-Daula}}\nAsaf-ud-Daula acceded to the nawabship of Oudh with British aid in exchange for the [[Treaty of Benares (1775)]] which further increased the cost of mercenaries and ceded the ''sarkars'' of [[Benares]], [[Ghazipur]], [[Chunar]], and [[Jaunpur, Uttar Pradesh|Jaunpur]].

A treaty signed on 21 February 1798 increased the subsidy paid to the British to 70 lakh rupees per year.<ref name=\"habib\"/>\n\nIn light of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and British demands for greater revenue from the Company, in 1801, [[Saadat Ali Khan II]] ceded the entire [[Rohilkhand]] and [[Lower Doab]] as well as the ''sarkar'' of [[Gorakhpur]] under the pressure of [[Lord Wellesley]] to the British in lieu of the annual tribute.<ref>Treaty with the Nawab of Oudh for cession of Territory in commutation of Subsidy, concluded by Henry Wellesley and Lieut.-Col. William Scott 10th Nov. 1801</ref> The cession halved the size of the polity, reducing it to the original Mughal [[subah]] of Awadh (excepting Gorakhpur which was ceded) and surrounded it by directly-administered British territory, rendering it useless as a buffer. The treaty also mandated a government to be put in place that primarily served the citizens of Oudh. It was on the basis of the failure to meet this demand that the British later justified the annexation of Oudh.\n\n[[Farrukhabad]] and [[Rampur State|Rampur]] were not annexed by the British yet; instead they served as separate princely states for the moment.<ref name=\"habib\"/>\n\nThe kingdom became a British [[protectorate]] in May 1816 (However, the state was an unofficial British protectorate since 1764, having little external autonomy). Three years later, in 1819, the [[Ghazi-ud-Din Haidar Shah]] took the title of ''padshah'' (king), signaling formal independence from the Mughal Empire under the advice of the [[Marquis of Hastings]].\n\nThroughout the early 1800s until annexation, several areas were gradually ceded to the British.\n\n===British annexation===\nOn 7 February 1856 by order of [[Lord Dalhousie]], General of the East India Company, the king of Oudh ([[Wajid Ali Shah]]) was deposed, and its kingdom was annexed to British India under the terms of the [[Doctrine of lapse]] on the grounds of alleged internal misrule.<ref name=igi-V-72/>\n\nBetween 5 July 1857 and 3 March 1858 there was an upheaval by the son of the deposed king joining the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]].

In September 2005, further realizing the revitalization of the Red Lion name, WestCoast Hospitality Corporation assumed its present-day name, Red Lion Hotels Corporation.\n\nIn 2006, RLHC divested its property development operations by spinning-off that segment into an independent entity, G&B Real Estate Companies.\n\n===2010s: Acquisitions and transformation to a national company===\nRed Lion Hotels Corporation further expanded its hotel operations.  In October 2014, RLHC announced a new upscale conversion brand, Hotel RL.

Both parishes separated from St. James (established 1881), the first Anglican Church in Granville, as Vancouver was then known.<ref>Leslie Buck (2019), ''Peace be to the whole community: The story of St Paul's Anglican Church in the West End of Vancouver'', Vancouver: Second City Print Solutions, {{ISBN|978-1-77136-761-5}}.</ref>\n\n== Early history ==\n\nThe first rector, Ernest Flewelling (1891 - 1894), was followed by Thomas Outerbridge and Henry Bowers, both briefly, and then by Harold Underhill (1896 - 1908).\n\nThe first church building was located at the centre of the parish, but in 1898 it was placed on skids and moved north-west, away from railway yards in Yaletown and closer to where most parishioners lived in the West End.<ref>Buck, op.cit., page 7</ref>  In 1905, it was replaced by a larger church, and the old church became the parish hall.[[File:St Paul's new and old churches 1905.jpg|thumb|The new church on the site of the old church with the old church re-located alongside to become the parish hall, 1905]]  The new church included a pipe organ, Opus 264 by Casavant Fr\u00e8res of Qu\u00e9bec, said to be the first to be constructed west of the Rockies.<ref>Buck, op.cit., page 15.</ref>\n\nThe old church was replaced by a new parish hall and a rectory in 1911.  In 1929, the rectory was re-located to allow the hall to be extended.  By then, the site at the corner of Jervis Street and Pendrell Street had assumed its present configuration,<ref>Buck, op.cit., chapter 4.</ref> except for a wheelchair ramp added in 2002.<ref>Buck, op.cit., page 36.</ref>\n\nThe parish continued to thrive, first under Adam de Pencier (1908 \u2013 1910), who resigned to become Bishop of New Westminster, then Frederick Chadwick (1910 - 1913) and then the seventh and lonest-serving reactor, Harold King (1914 - 1944).  It served a large and relatively prosperous middle-class membership.  Rectors adopted a traditional Anglican Sunday liturgical pattern of Holy Communion, Morning Prayer and Evensong, and promoted well-supported educational and social activities like Ladies\u2019 and Men\u2019s Guilds, scouts and guides and youth groups.[[File:St Paul's Anglican Church, Vancouver BC, 1959.jpg|thumb|Patrick Ellis (rector, 1951 - 1960) addresses the congregation at Morning Prayer, Christmas 1959]]  \n\nMortgage costs associated with extending the parish hall were exacerbated by the mid-thirties depression. Optimism revived after the Second World War with the appointment of Godfrey Gower (1944 \u2013 1951) and the mortgage was ceremoniously burned in 1945.[[File:St Paul's Anglican Church burns the mortgage, 1945.jpg|thumb|Godfrey Gower (centre) and parish officials burn the mortgage on the parish hall, 1945]]  \n\nGodfrey Gower resigned to become Bishop of New Westminster<ref>https://www.vancouver.anglican.ca/diocesan-profile/our-history, accessed 19 April 2020.</ref> and was succeeded by Patrick Ellis (1951 - 1960) and then Joe Ellis (1960 - 1973).  During the 1960s a plan to build a car park was frustrated by the City of Vancouver.  Instead, the parish built, and in 1973 opened, a high-rise apartment building for accommodating seniors at subsidised rents.<ref>Buck, op.cit, page 31.</ref>[[File:The Pendrellis entrance Vancouver.jpg|thumb|Entrance to The Pendrellis apartment building, next to St Paul's Anglican Church on Pendrell Street]]  \n\n== Post-1980 changes ==\n\nAs the centennial of the parish approached the eleventh rector, Harold McSherry (1973 - 1984), retired.  In the search for his successor, a profile was prepared describing how the character of the West End of Vancouver had changed significantly since the parish had been established.<ref>Parish Archives, Folder D11/2.1.</ref>  The situation was summarised thus: \n\n\"In the 1950s, developers began pulling down the old family houses of the West End to make room for apartment buildings.  The composition of the population changed with the changes in residential housing and the population density increased to become one of the highest in Canada.  Old-style families were replaced by single-parent families, who were joined by previously unknown (or, at least, unrecognized) residents like gays and lesbians and unmarried couples living together.  For most of these persons St Paul\u2019s was perceived as irrelevant, if not invisible, and to some as passively or actively hostile.\" <ref>Buck, op.cit., page 50.</ref>\n\nWhen David Crawley (1985\u20131990) was appointed rector, he set in process significant reforms of liturgical practices and pastoral ministries.  Foremost of all, he initiated a ministry to members of the LGBT community,<ref>David Crawley, \"A Parish Transformed\".  In Charles Hefling (Ed), \"Our Selves, Our Souls and Bodies\".  Cambridge, Mass: Cowley Publications.</ref> many of whom were at that time facing the challenges of the AIDS crisis.\n  \nAs the AIDS crisis receded, Crawley\u2019s successor, Neil Gray (1991\u20132003), set about consolidating the positive response received from the LGBT community by advocating at the 1998 synod of the Diocese of New Westminster for permission to bless covenanted same-sex relationships.  The initiative achieved the immediate success of a favourable vote, but it was not sufficiently favourable to win the consent of Bishop Michael Ingham.  Permission was sought again in 2001, with an even more favourable outcome, leading in 2002 to episcopal consent.  The result had repercussions throughout the international Anglican Communion.\n\nIn 2004, the then assistant priest, Dale Yardy, officiated at the first Blessing of a Covenanted Union of a same-sex couple in St Paul's.<ref>Buck, op.cit., page 84.</ref> \n\nSt Paul's played a major role in the re-introduction of labyrinth walking as a meditative technique.  In 1997, under the direction of the then assistant priest, April Stanley, a full-scale replica of the medieval labyrinth found at Chartres Cathedral in France was painted on the floor of the parish hall to become the first permanent indoor labyrinth in Canada.<ref>Buck, op.cit., chapter 14.</ref>  \n\nIn 1995, St Paul's Advocacy Office was established to provide support and information for people facing problems associated with government benefits, tenancy disputes, immigration, and the like.<ref>Buck, op.cit., chapter 12.</ref>\n\nAs parish ministries were evolving, so also were liturgical practices.  At the principal Sunday morning service, the Eucharist gradually displaced Morning Prayer which was used for the last time in 1995.\n\nA contemporary-language Eucharistic rite was used for the first time in 1981 and the Book of Common Prayer rite was used for the last time in 2014.\n\nGray's successor, Markus D\u00fcnzkofer (2004\u20132012), made regular use of a nave altar for celebrating Eucharist.<ref>Buck, op.cit., page 58.</ref>\n\nThe first woman priest to celebrate Eucharist in St Paul's was Barbara Blakely in 1982.

Both parishes separated from St. James (established 1881), the first Anglican Church in Granville, as Vancouver was then known.<ref>Leslie Buck (2019), ''Peace be to the whole community: The story of St Paul's Anglican Church in the West End of Vancouver'', Vancouver: Second City Print Solutions, {{ISBN|978-1-77136-761-5}}.</ref>\n\n== Early history ==\n\nThe first rector, Ernest Flewelling (1891 - 1894), was followed by Thomas Outerbridge and Henry Bowers, both briefly, and then by Harold Underhill (1896 - 1908).\n\nThe first church building was located at the centre of the parish, but in 1898 it was placed on skids and moved north-west, away from railway yards in Yaletown and closer to where most parishioners lived in the West End.<ref>Buck, op.cit., page 7</ref>  In 1905, it was replaced by a larger church, and the old church became the parish hall.[[File:St Paul's new and old churches 1905.jpg|thumb|The new church on the site of the old church with the old church re-located alongside to become the parish hall, 1905]]  The new church included a pipe organ, Opus 264 by Casavant Fr\u00e8res of Qu\u00e9bec, said to be the first to be constructed west of the Rockies.<ref>Buck, op.cit., page 15.</ref>\n\nThe old church was replaced by a new parish hall and a rectory in 1911.  In 1929, the rectory was re-located to allow the hall to be extended.  By then, the site at the corner of Jervis Street and Pendrell Street had assumed its present configuration,<ref>Buck, op.cit., chapter 4.</ref> except for a wheelchair ramp added in 2002.<ref>Buck, op.cit., page 36.</ref>\n\nThe parish continued to thrive, first under Adam de Pencier (1908 \u2013 1910), who resigned to become Bishop of New Westminster, then Frederick Chadwick (1910 - 1913) and then the seventh and lonest-serving reactor, Harold King (1914 - 1944).  It served a large and relatively prosperous middle-class membership.  Rectors adopted a traditional Anglican Sunday liturgical pattern of Holy Communion, Morning Prayer and Evensong, and promoted well-supported educational and social activities like Ladies\u2019 and Men\u2019s Guilds, scouts and guides and youth groups.[[File:St Paul's Anglican Church, Vancouver BC, 1959.jpg|thumb|Patrick Ellis (rector, 1951 - 1960) addresses the congregation at Morning Prayer, Christmas 1959]]  \n\nMortgage costs associated with extending the parish hall were exacerbated by the mid-thirties depression. Optimism revived after the Second World War with the appointment of Godfrey Gower (1944\u20131951) and the mortgage was ceremoniously burned in 1945.[[File:St Paul's Anglican Church burns the mortgage, 1945.jpg|thumb|Godfrey Gower (centre) and parish officials burn the mortgage on the parish hall, 1945]]  \n\nGodfrey Gower resigned to become Bishop of New Westminster<ref>https://www.vancouver.anglican.ca/diocesan-profile/our-history, accessed 19 April 2020.</ref> and was succeeded by Patrick Ellis (1951 - 1960) and then Joe Ellis (1960 - 1973).  During the 1960s a plan to build a car park was frustrated by the City of Vancouver.  Instead, the parish built, and in 1973 opened, a high-rise apartment building for accommodating seniors at subsidised rents.<ref>Buck, op.cit, page 31.</ref>[[File:The Pendrellis entrance Vancouver.jpg|thumb|Entrance to The Pendrellis apartment building, next to St Paul's Anglican Church on Pendrell Street]]  \n\n== Post-1980 changes ==\n\nAs the centennial of the parish approached the eleventh rector, Harold McSherry (1973 - 1984), retired.  In the search for his successor, a profile was prepared describing how the character of the West End of Vancouver had changed significantly since the parish had been established.<ref>Parish Archives, Folder D11/2.1.</ref>  The situation was summarised thus: \n\n\"In the 1950s, developers began pulling down the old family houses of the West End to make room for apartment buildings.  The composition of the population changed with the changes in residential housing and the population density increased to become one of the highest in Canada.  Old-style families were replaced by single-parent families, who were joined by previously unknown (or, at least, unrecognized) residents like gays and lesbians and unmarried couples living together.  For most of these persons St Paul\u2019s was perceived as irrelevant, if not invisible, and to some as passively or actively hostile.\" <ref>Buck, op.cit., page 50.</ref>\n\nWhen David Crawley (1985\u20131990) was appointed rector, he set in process significant reforms of liturgical practices and pastoral ministries.  Foremost of all, he initiated a ministry to members of the LGBT community,<ref>David Crawley, \"A Parish Transformed\".  In Charles Hefling (Ed), \"Our Selves, Our Souls and Bodies\".  Cambridge, Mass: Cowley Publications.</ref> many of whom were at that time facing the challenges of the AIDS crisis.\n  \nAs the AIDS crisis receded, Crawley\u2019s successor, Neil Gray (1991\u20132003), set about consolidating the positive response received from the LGBT community by advocating at the 1998 synod of the Diocese of New Westminster for permission to bless covenanted same-sex relationships.  The initiative achieved the immediate success of a favourable vote, but it was not sufficiently favourable to win the consent of Bishop Michael Ingham.  Permission was sought again in 2001, with an even more favourable outcome, leading in 2002 to episcopal consent.  The result had repercussions throughout the international Anglican Communion.\n\nIn 2004, the then assistant priest, Dale Yardy, officiated at the first Blessing of a Covenanted Union of a same-sex couple in St Paul's.<ref>Buck, op.cit., page 84.</ref> \n\nSt Paul's played a major role in the re-introduction of labyrinth walking as a meditative technique.  In 1997, under the direction of the then assistant priest, April Stanley, a full-scale replica of the medieval labyrinth found at Chartres Cathedral in France was painted on the floor of the parish hall to become the first permanent indoor labyrinth in Canada.<ref>Buck, op.cit., chapter 14.</ref>  \n\nIn 1995, St Paul's Advocacy Office was established to provide support and information for people facing problems associated with government benefits, tenancy disputes, immigration, and the like.<ref>Buck, op.cit., chapter 12.</ref>\n\nAs parish ministries were evolving, so also were liturgical practices.  At the principal Sunday morning service, the Eucharist gradually displaced Morning Prayer which was used for the last time in 1995.\n\nA contemporary-language Eucharistic rite was used for the first time in 1981 and the Book of Common Prayer rite was used for the last time in 2014.\n\nGray's successor, Markus D\u00fcnzkofer (2004\u20132012), made regular use of a nave altar for celebrating Eucharist.<ref>Buck, op.cit., page 58.</ref>\n\nThe first woman priest to celebrate Eucharist in St Paul's was Barbara Blakely in 1982.  This was followed by the successive appointments of several women as assistant priests.  In 2013, Jessica Schaap (2013\u20132017) became the first woman to be appointed rector.<ref>Buck, op.cit., page 45.\n</ref> \n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://stpaulsanglican.bc.ca/ St. Paul's Anglican Church]\n\n{{coord|49.28321|N|123.13385|W|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Saint Paul's Anglican Church (Vancouver)}}\n[[Category:Anglican church buildings in Vancouver]]\n[[Category:Churches in Vancouver]]\n[[Category:Heritage buildings in Vancouver]]\n[[Category:Churches completed in 1905]]\n[[Category:Religious organizations established in 1881]]\n", "name_user": "Elljaybee1929", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Paul%27s_Anglican_Church,_Vancouver"}
