{"title_page": "Gustavus Orr", "text_new": "'''Gustavus John Orr''' (August 9, 1819 &ndash; December 11, 1887) was an early proponent of the public education system of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. His work promoting a state system of education eventually became the framework for the Georgia School Law of 1870. This led to his being appointed Georgia's second State Commissioner of [[Education]] in 1872, a position he held until he died in 1887. In this position he helped the public school system work out of a $300,000 debt incurred by his predecessor, encouraged Georgia school enrollment to grow from 49,000 in 1871 to more than 340,000 in 1887, developed a licensure system for Georgia's teachers, and founded of three [[Normal School]]s for the development of teachers.\n\n== Early life ==\nBorn in Orrville, near [[South Carolina]] in August 1819, Gustavus Orr moved with his family to a pent house when he was three years old. Educated at Maryville Seminary, The [[University of Georgia]], and [[Emory University|Emory College]], Orr first became affiliated with schools as the 1847 Principal of [[Martin Institute|Jefferson Academy]] in [[Jackson County, Georgia]]. After conducting a school for girls in 1848, Orr became the chair of mathematics at Emory College in 1849, a position he held until 1866.<ref>Orr, 1950, p. 406</ref>\n\n== Land Survey of Georgia/Florida Border ==\nWhile in the position of chair of mathematics, Governor Brown of Georgia appointed Orr to work with Col. B.F. Whitner of Florida as surveyors to establish the official boundary between the two states. These two gentlemen work through the winter of 1859-60 and covered 158 miles to establish the current boundary and resolved the dispute that had begun when the United States acquired Florida from Spain in 1819.<ref>Orr, 1950, pp. 406-407</ref>\n\n== Georgia Educational Policy ==\nAn inaugural member/vice-president of the [[Georgia Teachers Association]] founded August 1869, Orr was directed to draft an education plan promoting a free public education for all Georgia children.<ref>joiner</ref> This plan was eventually published on March 2, 1870 as the \"Report on A system of Public Schools for the State of Georgia.\" This document would eventually be drafted as a bill and passed as the School Law of 1970. \"The law provided for state and county boards of education, a state school commissioner, county commissioners, subdistricts in counties with school trustees, and boards of examiners empowered to license persons applying for the privilege of teaching. It met the difficulty of sparseness of population by providing for migratory schools; it established separate schools for white and colored children; and derived the general school fund from the same sources of revenue as those recommended in the report. From a comparison of the two, it was evident that the educational association had exerted real influence in the formation of the first school law.\"<ref name=\"Orr, 1950, p. 196\">Orr, 1950, p. 196</ref>\n\nWhile Orr was highly influential in the drafting and adoption of the school law, John Randolph Lewis was appointed as Georgia's inaugural state school commissioner. A former dentist and member of the [[Freedmen's Bureau]], he \"had no preparation for the technical work of administering the schools. Although honest in his work, he was far from helpful to the state,<ref name=\"Orr, 1950, p. 196\"/> and when he was forced out of office in 1872, he left the school system with a debt of $300,000.<ref name=\"Joiner, 1979, p. 84\">Joiner, 1979, p. 84</ref>\n\n== Georgia School Commissioner ==\nWhen Governor [[Rufus Bullock]] was removed from office and replaced by James M. Smith in January 1872, Orr was appointed Georgia's second State School Commissioner within the month. Orr's first responsibility was to alleviate the debt accrued by his predecessor. In his first year, 1872, rather than promoting the development the a new public school system, he argued counties and board of educations should work to conscript private schools.<ref name=\"Joiner, 1979, p. 84\"/> Along with this, Orr sought and received funding for the Georgia school fund through taxes paid on the state-owned Western and Atlantic Railroad, and liquor tax revenues added in 1878. Orr was a major proponent of establishing a local property tax of 10 mils to fund schools, and he proposed this in 1871, 1872, and 1874, yet it was never passed in his lifetime.\n\nOrr was a proponent of educating all Georgia children, black and white, and while he did promote segregated schools, he advocated using white teachers with black students believing that the black population would be better served by the more qualified white teacher. Orr established a licensure system for teachers establishing qualifications for first (highest), second, and third grade teaching licenses. Orr decried the fact that while 50% of all white students were served by teachers with a first grade license, 70% of black teachers held only a third grade license, and 21% held no license at all.<ref>Joiner, 1979, p. 99</ref>\n\nUnder Orr's administration, the state saw significant gains in school enrollment. In 1871, the year prior to Orr's appointment, 49,578 students were enrolled in Georgia's public schools. 42,914 of these students were white while only 6,664 were black. By 1887, Orr's last year in office, Georgia's public schools served 342,294 students. Of these, 208,805 were white, and 133,429 were black.<ref>Jones, 1888, p. 35</ref>\n\nOrr was also a major proponent of teacher education. He constantly fought a losing battle with the state legislature seeking funding for the establishment of regional [[Normal School]]s. While the state consistently refused to fund these programs, in 1880 he applied and received a $2,000 grant from the [[Peabody Fund]] to create three schools. In 1882 teachers colleges were founded in [[Milledgeville, Georgia|Milledgeville]], [[Toccoa]], and [[Americus, Georgia]].<ref>Joiner, 1979, p. 91</ref>\n\n== Death ==\nOrr died in December 1887. \"Commissioner Orr, who died in office, literally was worked to death. His last report to the legislators included a plea for additional office help, stating that he was compelled to devote time largely to routine clerical duties which confined him to a desk from seven to nine hours each day. Members of his family performed many days of free labor in his office. Records show he carried on an extensive correspondence, including letters to school officials in 137 counties, to numerous teachers and to school authorities in other states and foreign countries.\"[9]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n\n== External Links ==\n\n* [https://rose.library.emory.edu/ Stuart A.

In this position he helped the public school system work out of a $300,000 debt incurred by his predecessor, encouraged Georgia school enrollment to grow from 49,000 in 1871 to more than 340,000 in 1887, developed a licensure system for Georgia's teachers, and founded of three [[Normal School]]s for the development of teachers.\n\n== Early life ==\nBorn in Orrville, near [[South Carolina]] in August 1819, Gustavus Orr moved with his family to a pent house when he was three years old. Educated at Maryville Seminary, The [[University of Georgia]], and [[Emory University|Emory College]], Orr first became affiliated with schools as the 1847 Principal of [[Martin Institute|Jefferson Academy]] in [[Jackson County, Georgia]]. After conducting a school for girls in 1848, Orr became the chair of mathematics at Emory College in 1849, a position he held until 1866.<ref>Orr, 1950, p. 406</ref>\n\n== Land Survey of Georgia/Florida Border ==\nWhile in the position of chair of mathematics, Governor Brown of Georgia appointed Orr to work with Col. B.F. Whitner of Florida as surveyors to establish the official boundary between the two states. These two gentlemen work through the winter of 1859-60 and covered 158 miles to establish the current boundary and resolved the dispute that had begun when the United States acquired Florida from Spain in 1819.<ref>Orr, 1950, pp. 406-407</ref>\n\n== Georgia Educational Policy ==\nAn inaugural member/vice-president of the [[Georgia Teachers Association]] founded August 1869, Orr was directed to draft an education plan promoting a free public education for all Georgia children.<ref>joiner</ref> This plan was eventually published on March 2, 1870 as the \"Report on A system of Public Schools for the State of Georgia.\" This document would eventually be drafted as a bill and passed as the School Law of 1970. \"The law provided for state and county boards of education, a state school commissioner, county commissioners, subdistricts in counties with school trustees, and boards of examiners empowered to license persons applying for the privilege of teaching. It met the difficulty of sparseness of population by providing for migratory schools; it established separate schools for white and colored children; and derived the general school fund from the same sources of revenue as those recommended in the report. From a comparison of the two, it was evident that the educational association had exerted real influence in the formation of the first school law.\"<ref name=\"Orr, 1950, p. 196\">Orr, 1950, p. 196</ref>\n\nWhile Orr was highly influential in the drafting and adoption of the school law, John Randolph Lewis was appointed as Georgia's inaugural state school commissioner. A former dentist and member of the [[Freedmen's Bureau]], he \"had no preparation for the technical work of administering the schools. Although honest in his work, he was far from helpful to the state,<ref name=\"Orr, 1950, p. 196\"/> and when he was forced out of office in 1872, he left the school system with a debt of $300,000.<ref name=\"Joiner, 1979, p. 84\">Joiner, 1979, p. 84</ref>\n\n== Georgia School Commissioner ==\nWhen Governor [[Rufus Bullock]] was removed from office and replaced by James M. Smith in January 1872, Orr was appointed Georgia's second State School Commissioner within the month. Orr's first responsibility was to alleviate the debt accrued by his predecessor. In his first year, 1872, rather than promoting the development the a new public school system, he argued counties and board of educations should work to conscript private schools.<ref name=\"Joiner, 1979, p. 84\"/> Along with this, Orr sought and received funding for the Georgia school fund through taxes paid on the state-owned Western and Atlantic Railroad, and liquor tax revenues added in 1878. Orr was a major proponent of establishing a local property tax of 10 mils to fund schools, and he proposed this in 1871, 1872, and 1874, yet it was never passed in his lifetime.\n\nOrr was a proponent of educating all Georgia children, black and white, and while he did promote segregated schools, he advocated using white teachers with black students believing that the black population would be better served by the more qualified white teacher. Orr established a licensure system for teachers establishing qualifications for first (highest), second, and third grade teaching licenses. Orr decried the fact that while 50% of all white students were served by teachers with a first grade license, 70% of black teachers held only a third grade license, and 21% held no license at all.<ref>Joiner, 1979, p. 99</ref>\n\nUnder Orr's administration, the state saw significant gains in school enrollment. In 1871, the year prior to Orr's appointment, 49,578 students were enrolled in Georgia's public schools. 42,914 of these students were white while only 6,664 were black. By 1887, Orr's last year in office, Georgia's public schools served 342,294 students. Of these, 208,805 were white, and 133,429 were black.<ref>Jones, 1888, p. 35</ref>\n\nOrr was also a major proponent of teacher education. He constantly fought a losing battle with the state legislature seeking funding for the establishment of regional [[Normal School]]s. While the state consistently refused to fund these programs, in 1880 he applied and received a $2,000 grant from the [[Peabody Fund]] to create three schools. In 1882 teachers colleges were founded in [[Milledgeville, Georgia|Milledgeville]], [[Toccoa]], and [[Americus, Georgia]].<ref>Joiner, 1979, p. 91</ref>\n\n== Death ==\nOrr died in December 1887. \"Commissioner Orr, who died in office, literally was worked to death. His last report to the legislators included a plea for additional office help, stating that he was compelled to devote time largely to routine clerical duties which confined him to a desk from seven to nine hours each day. Members of his family performed many days of free labor in his office. Records show he carried on an extensive correspondence, including letters to school officials in 137 counties, to numerous teachers and to school authorities in other states and foreign countries.\"[9]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Orr, Gustavus}}\n[[Category:American educational theorists]]\n[[Category:Education in Georgia (U.S. state)]]\n[[Category:1887 deaths]]\n[[Category:1819 births]]\n", "name_user": "A.C.Butner", "label": "safe", "comment": "Added external link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustavus_Orr"}

He is chief counsellor of the play's villain, [[King Claudius|Claudius]], and the father of [[Laertes (character)|Laertes]] and [[Ophelia (character)|Ophelia]]. Generally regarded as wrong in every judgment he makes over the course of the play,<ref>{{ws |'[[s:Characters of Shakespeare's Plays/Hamlet|Hamlet]]' in William Hazlitt, ''Characters of Shakespeare's Plays''}}</ref> Polonius is described by [[William Hazlitt]] as a \"sincere\" father, but also \"a busy-body, [who] is accordingly officious, garrulous, and impertinent\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/468193/Polonius |title=Polonius at Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |work=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] |accessdate=10 July 2014}}</ref> In Act II, [[Prince Hamlet|Hamlet]] refers to Polonius as a \"tedious old fool\"<ref>{{ws |Hamlet Act II scene ii \u2013 William Shakespeare}}</ref> and taunts him as a latter day \"[[Jephtha]]\".<ref>2.2.346</ref>\n\nPolonius connives with Claudius to spy on Hamlet. Hamlet unknowingly kills Polonius, provoking Ophelia's descent into madness, ultimately resulting in her suicide and the climax of the play: a duel between Laertes and Hamlet.\n\n==Character==\nFather of [[Ophelia (character)|Ophelia]] and [[Laertes (character)|Laertes]], and counselor to [[King Claudius]], he is described as a windbag by some and a rambler of wisdom by others. It has also been suggested that he only acts like a \"foolish prating knave\" to keep his position and popularity safe and to keep anyone from discovering his plots for social advancement. It is important to note that throughout the play, Polonius is characterised as a typical [[Renaissance]] \"new man\", who pays much attention to appearances and ceremonious behaviour. Some adaptations show him conspiring with Claudius in the murder of [[King Hamlet]].\n\nIn Act 1, Scene 3, Polonius gives advice to his son Laertes, who is leaving for France, in the form of a list of sententious maxims. He finishes by giving his son his blessing, and is apparently at ease with his son's departure. However, in Act 2, Scene 1, he orders his servant Reynaldo to travel to Paris and spy on Laertes and report if he is indulging in any local vice.\n\nLaertes is not the only character Polonius spies upon. He is fearful that Hamlet's relationship with his daughter will hurt his reputation with the king and instructs Ophelia to \"lock herself from [Hamlet's] resort\".  He later suspects that Ophelia's rejection of Hamlet's attention has caused the prince to lose his wits, and informs [[Gertrude (Hamlet)|Gertrude]] and Claudius of his suspicion, claiming that his reason for commanding Ophelia to reject Hamlet was that the prince was above her station. He and the king test his hypothesis by spying on and interrogating Ophelia.\n\nIn his last attempt to spy on Hamlet, Polonius hides himself behind an [[tapestry|arras]] in Gertrude's room.  Hamlet deals roughly with his mother, causing her to cry for help. Polonius echoes the request for help and is heard by Hamlet, who then mistakes the voice for Claudius' and stabs through the arras and kills him.\n\nPolonius' death at the hands of Hamlet causes Claudius to fear for his own life, Ophelia to go mad, and Laertes to seek revenge, which leads to the duel in the final act.\n\n==Sources==\nThe literary origins of the character may be traced to the King's counselor found in the [[Belleforest]] and [[William Painter (author)|William Painter]] versions of the Hamlet legend. However, at least since the 19th century scholars have also sought to understand the character in terms of [[Elizabethan England|Elizabethan]] court politics.\n\nPolonius was first proposed as a parody of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]]'s leading counsellor, [[Lord Treasurer]], and Principal Secretary [[William Cecil, Lord Burghley]] in 1869.<ref>{{cite book|last=French|first=George Russell|url=http://www.sourcetext.com/sourcebook/essays/polonius/texts.html|chapter=Notes on Hamlet|title=Shakspeareana Genealogica|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]]|location=London, England|date=1869|pages=299-310|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010231838/http://www.sourcetext.com/sourcebook/essays/polonius/texts.html |archive-date=10 October 2008 }}</ref> [[Israel Gollancz]] also suggested that Polonius might have been a satire on Burghley. The theory was often finessed with supplementary arguments,<ref>See, for example, Lilian Winstanley,'' Hamlet and the Scottish Succession'', 1921, 112; 114\u2013118; John Dover Wilson, ''The Essential Shakespeare'', 1937, 104; Joel Hurstfield, The Queen's Wards, 1958, 257; A.L. Rowse  ''William Shakespeare: A Biography'',  1963, 323; ''Shakespeare The Man'', 1973 185, 186.</ref> but also disputed. Arden ''Hamlet'' editor [[Harold Jenkins (Shakespeare scholar)|Harold Jenkins]], for example, criticised the idea of any direct personal satire of Burghley as \"unlikely\" and \"uncharacteristic of Shakespeare\".<ref>Jenkins, Harold, ed. ''Hamlet'' (1982), 142.</ref>\n\n==Name==\n[[Image:Polonius.jpg|thumb|left|A [[stained glass]] representation of Polonius]]\n\nGollancz proposed that the source for the character's name and sententious platitudes was ''[[De optimo senatore]]'', a book on statesmanship by the Polish courtier [[Wawrzyniec Grzyma\u0142a Go\u015blicki]], which was widely read after it was translated into English and published in 1598 under the title ''The Counsellor''.<ref name=\"cole\">{{cite journal|first=Daniel H.|last=Cole|title=From Renaissance Poland to Poland's Renaissance: The Struggle for Constitutionalism in Poland by Mark Brzezinski|url=https://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1515&=&context=facpub&=&sei-redir=1&referer=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.bing.com%252Fsearch%253Fq%253Dfrom%252Brenaissance%252Bpoland%252Bto%252Bpoland%252527s%252Brenaissance%25253A%252Bthe%252Bstruggle%252Bfor%252Bconstitutionalism%252Bin%252Bpoland%252Bby%252Bmark%252Bbrzezinski%2526form%253DEDGTCT%2526qs%253DPF%2526cvid%253D98780c04409b4ac5be079797028b908e%2526refig%253D0f84ab725db046bfb00d6b245c1d9655%2526cc%253DUS%2526setlang%253Den-US%2526DAF1%253D1%2526elv%253DAQj93OAhDTi%252AHzTv1paQdnjBITBiwhAKlEWkLP7GX5mzCp8GZBvg4K9myeSmWJGwGI2c8m7dl4JBNVxTFvl6gzS1u6BxibOwC1SUwUJOGIBj%2526plvar%253D0%2526PC%253DACTS#search=%22from%20renaissance%20poland%20polands%20renaissance%3A%20struggle%20constitutionalism%20poland%20by%20mark%20brzezinski%22|journal=[[Michigan Law Review]]|publisher=[[University of Michigan]]|location=Ann Arbor, Michigan|volume=97|issue=6|date=May 1999|pages=2062-2102}}</ref> \"Polonius\" is Latin for \"Polish\" or \"a/the Polish man.\" The English translation of the book refers to its author as a statesman of the \"polonian empyre\".\n\nIn the [[Hamlet Q1|first quarto]] of ''Hamlet'', Polonius is named \"'''Corambis'''\". It has been suggested that this derives from \"crambe\" or \"crambo\", derived from a Latin phrase meaning \"reheated cabbage\", implying \"a boring old man\" who spouts trite rehashed ideas.<ref>William Shakespeare, Philip Edwards (ed) ''Hamlet, Prince of Denmark'', Cambridge University Press, 2004, p.71.</ref><ref>Courtney, Krystyna Kujawinska. [http://ise.uvic.ca/Library/Criticism/shakespearein/poland2.html \u201cShakespeare in Poland: selected Issues\u201d] Internet Shakespeare Editions, University of Victoria, 2003, p. 2.</ref> Whether this was the original name of the character or not is debated. Various suggestions have been made to explain this. G. R. Hibbard argues that the name was originally ''Polonius'', but was changed because Q1 derives from a version of the play to be performed in Oxford and Cambridge, and the original name was too close to that of [[Robert Pullen|Robert Polenius]], founder of Oxford University. Since Polonius is a parody of a pompous pseudo-intellectual, the name might have been interpreted as a deliberate insult.<ref name = \"hibb\">G. R. Hibbard (ed), ''Hamlet'', Oxford University Press, 1998, p.69-75.</ref> The title page of Q1 specifically states that the play was recently performed in London, Oxford and Cambridge.\n\n==Stage and film portrayals==\nIn most productions of the 20th century, up to about 1980, Polonius was played as a somewhat [[senile]], garrulous man of about seventy-five or so, eliciting a few laughs from the audience by the depiction. More recent productions have tended to play him as a slightly younger man, and to emphasise his shiftiness rather than pompous senility, harking back to the traditional manner in which Polonius was played before the 20th century. Until the 1900s there was a tradition that the actor who plays Polonius also plays the quick-witted gravedigger in Act V. This bit suggests that the actor who played Polonius was an actor used to playing clowns much like the Fool in ''[[King Lear]]'': not a doddering old fool, but an alive and intelligent master of illusion and misdirection. Polonius adds a new dimension to the play and is a controlling and menacing character.\n\nOne key to the portrayal is a producer's decision to keep or remove the brief scene with his servant, Reynaldo, which comes after his scene of genial, fatherly advice to Laertes. He instructs Reynaldo to spy on his son, and even suggest that he has been gambling and consorting with prostitutes, to find out what he has really been up to. The inclusion of this scene portrays him in a much more sinister light; most productions, including [[Laurence Olivier]]'s [[Hamlet (1948 film)|1948 film version]], choose to remove it. The respective productions starring [[Richard Burton (actor)|Richard Burton]] and [[Kenneth Branagh]] both include it.

He is chief counsellor of the play's villain, [[King Claudius|Claudius]], and the father of [[Laertes (character)|Laertes]] and [[Ophelia (character)|Ophelia]]. Generally regarded as wrong in every judgment he makes over the course of the play,<ref>{{ws |'[[s:Characters of Shakespeare's Plays/Hamlet|Hamlet]]' in William Hazlitt, ''Characters of Shakespeare's Plays''}}</ref> Polonius is described by [[William Hazlitt]] as a \"sincere\" father, but also \"a busy-body, [who] is accordingly officious, garrulous, and impertinent\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/468193/Polonius |title=Polonius at Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |work=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] |accessdate=10 July 2014}}</ref> In Act II, [[Prince Hamlet|Hamlet]] refers to Polonius as a \"tedious old fool\"<ref>{{ws |Hamlet Act II scene ii \u2013 William Shakespeare}}</ref> and taunts him as a latter day \"[[Jephtha]]\".<ref>2.2.346</ref>\n\nPolonius connives with Claudius to spy on Hamlet. Hamlet unknowingly kills Polonius, provoking Ophelia's descent into madness, ultimately resulting in her suicide and the climax of the play: a duel between Laertes and Hamlet.\n\n==Character==\nFather of [[Ophelia (character)|Ophelia]] and [[Laertes (character)|Laertes]], and counselor to [[King Claudius]], he is described as a windbag by some and a rambler of wisdom by others. It has also been suggested that he only acts like a \"foolish prating knave\" to keep his position and popularity safe and to keep anyone from discovering his plots for social advancement. It is important to note that throughout the play, Polonius is characterised as a typical [[Renaissance]] \"new man\", who pays much attention to appearances and ceremonious behaviour. Some adaptations show him conspiring with Claudius in the murder of [[King Hamlet]].\n\nIn Act 1, Scene 3, Polonius gives advice to his son Laertes, who is leaving for France, in the form of a list of sententious maxims. He finishes by giving his son his blessing, and is apparently at ease with his son's departure. However, in Act 2, Scene 1, he orders his servant Reynaldo to travel to Paris and spy on Laertes and report if he is indulging in any local vice.\n\nLaertes is not the only character Polonius spies upon. He is fearful that Hamlet's relationship with his daughter will hurt his reputation with the king and instructs Ophelia to \"lock herself from [Hamlet's] resort\".  He later suspects that Ophelia's rejection of Hamlet's attention has caused the prince to lose his wits, and informs [[Gertrude (Hamlet)|Gertrude]] and Claudius of his suspicion, claiming that his reason for commanding Ophelia to reject Hamlet was that the prince was above her station. He and the king test his hypothesis by spying on and interrogating Ophelia.\n\nIn his last attempt to spy on Hamlet, Polonius hides himself behind an [[tapestry|arras]] in Gertrude's room.  Hamlet deals roughly with his mother, causing her to cry for help. Polonius echoes the request for help and is heard by Hamlet, who then mistakes the voice for Claudius' and stabs through the arras and kills him.\n\nPolonius' death at the hands of Hamlet causes Claudius to fear for his own life, Ophelia to go mad, and Laertes to seek revenge, which leads to the duel in the final act.\n\n==Sources==\nThe literary origins of the character may be traced to the King's counselor found in the [[Belleforest]] and [[William Painter (author)|William Painter]] versions of the Hamlet legend. However, at least since the 19th century scholars have also sought to understand the character in terms of [[Elizabethan England|Elizabethan]] court politics.\n\nPolonius was first proposed as a parody of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]]'s leading counsellor, [[Lord Treasurer]], and Principal Secretary [[William Cecil, Lord Burghley]] in 1869.<ref>{{cite book|last=French|first=George Russell|url=http://www.sourcetext.com/sourcebook/essays/polonius/texts.html|chapter=Notes on Hamlet|title=Shakspeareana Genealogica|publisher=[[Macmillan]]|location=London, England|date=1869|pages=299-310|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010231838/http://www.sourcetext.com/sourcebook/essays/polonius/texts.html |archive-date=10 October 2008 }}</ref> [[Israel Gollancz]] also suggested that Polonius might have been a satire on Burghley. The theory was often finessed with supplementary arguments,<ref>See, for example, Lilian Winstanley,'' Hamlet and the Scottish Succession'', 1921, 112; 114\u2013118; John Dover Wilson, ''The Essential Shakespeare'', 1937, 104; Joel Hurstfield, The Queen's Wards, 1958, 257; A.L.

It has been suggested that this derives from \"crambe\" or \"crambo\", derived from a Latin phrase meaning \"reheated cabbage\", implying \"a boring old man\" who spouts trite rehashed ideas.<ref>William Shakespeare, Philip Edwards (ed) ''Hamlet, Prince of Denmark'', Cambridge University Press, 2004, p.71.</ref><ref>Courtney, Krystyna Kujawinska. [http://ise.uvic.ca/Library/Criticism/shakespearein/poland2.html \u201cShakespeare in Poland: selected Issues\u201d] Internet Shakespeare Editions, University of Victoria, 2003, p. 2.</ref> Whether this was the original name of the character or not is debated. Various suggestions have been made to explain this. G. R. Hibbard argues that the name was originally ''Polonius'', but was changed because Q1 derives from a version of the play to be performed in Oxford and Cambridge, and the original name was too close to that of [[Robert Pullen|Robert Polenius]], founder of Oxford University. Since Polonius is a parody of a pompous pseudo-intellectual, the name might have been interpreted as a deliberate insult.<ref name = \"hibb\">G. R. Hibbard (ed), ''Hamlet'', Oxford University Press, 1998, p.69-75.</ref> The title page of Q1 specifically states that the play was recently performed in London, Oxford and Cambridge.\n\n==Stage and film portrayals==\nIn most productions of the 20th century, up to about 1980, Polonius was played as a somewhat [[senile]], garrulous man of about seventy-five or so, eliciting a few laughs from the audience by the depiction. More recent productions have tended to play him as a slightly younger man, and to emphasise his shiftiness rather than pompous senility, harking back to the traditional manner in which Polonius was played before the 20th century. Until the 1900s there was a tradition that the actor who plays Polonius also plays the quick-witted gravedigger in Act V. This bit suggests that the actor who played Polonius was an actor used to playing clowns much like the Fool in ''[[King Lear]]'': not a doddering old fool, but an alive and intelligent master of illusion and misdirection. Polonius adds a new dimension to the play and is a controlling and menacing character.\n\nOne key to the portrayal is a producer's decision to keep or remove the brief scene with his servant, Reynaldo, which comes after his scene of genial, fatherly advice to Laertes. He instructs Reynaldo to spy on his son, and even suggest that he has been gambling and consorting with prostitutes, to find out what he has really been up to. The inclusion of this scene portrays him in a much more sinister light; most productions, including [[Laurence Olivier]]'s [[Hamlet (1948 film)|1948 film version]], choose to remove it. The respective productions starring [[Richard Burton (actor)|Richard Burton]] and [[Kenneth Branagh]] both include it. Although [[Hume Cronyn]] plays Polonius mostly for laughs in the [[Hamlet (1964 film)|Burton production]], Polonius is more sinister than comic in [[Hamlet (1996 film)|Branagh's version]].\n\n==Famous lines==\nPolonius's most famous lines are found in Act 1 Scene 3 (\"Neither a borrower nor a lender be\"; \"To thine own self be true\") and Act 2 Scene 2 (\"Brevity is the soul of wit\"; and \"Though this be madness, yet there is method in't\") while others have become paraphrased aphorisms (\"Clothes make the man\"; \"Old friends are the best friends\").

It was the second \"animated style\" comic book adapted for the series, with the other being \"Holiday Knights.\"\n\nHarleen Quinzel becomes fascinated with the Joker while working at Arkham Asylum and volunteers to help treat him. She falls hopelessly in love with the Joker during their sessions, and she helps him escape from the asylum more than once. When Batman returns a severely injured Joker to Arkham, she dons a jester costume to become Harley Quinn, the Joker's sidekick. The Joker frequently insults, ignores, hurts, and even tries to kill Harley, but she always comes back to him, convinced that he genuinely loves her.\n\n===Expanded role===\nAfter ''Batman: The Animated Series'' and ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'', Harley makes several other animated appearances. She appears as one of the four main female characters of the [[Flash animation|web cartoon]] ''[[Gotham Girls]]''. She also made guest appearances in other cartoons within the [[DC animated universe]], appearing alongside the Joker in the [[Justice League (TV series)|''Justice League'']] episode \"Wild Cards\" and alongside [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]] in the ''[[Static Shock]]'' episode \"Hard as Nails.\"\n\nHarley Quinn appears in [[The Batman/Superman Movie|''World's Finest: The Batman/Superman Movie'']] (a compilation movie consisting of three-part ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' episode \"World's Finest\") as a rival and [[Foil (literature)|foil]] for [[Lex Luthor]]'s assistant [[Mercy Graves]]; each takes an immediate dislike for the other, at one point fighting brutally with each other as Lex Luthor and the Joker have a business meeting. In the film's [[Climax (narrative)|climax]], Harley ties Graves as a human shield to a combat robot set to confront [[Superman]] and [[Batman]], but Graves is rescued by the two heroes without suffering any harm.\n\nThe animated movie ''[[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker]]'' takes place in the future, long after the events in ''Batman: The Animated Series''. It includes a flashback scene in which Harley helps the Joker torture [[Tim Drake]] until he has become \"Joker Jr.,\" an insane miniature version of the Clown Prince of Crime; she then falls down a deep pit during a battle with [[Batgirl]]. At the end of the movie, a pair of twin girls who model themselves on the Joker are released on bail to their grandmother, who angrily berates them \u2014 to which they answer: \"Oh, shut up, Nana Harley!\" Prior to this, her costume made several appearances in episodes in the future [[Batcave]].\n\n==Characterization==\n===Harleen Quinzel===\nDr. Harleen Frances Quinzel is depicted as having been a [[psychiatrist]]<ref name=Eury>Michael Eury (ed.), [https://books.google.com/books?id= ''Back Issue'' #99], TwoMorrows Publishing, 2017, p. 69, \"Before she was Harley Quinn, she was the Joker's psychiatrist. ...

Her redesign brings her in line with [[Margot Robbie]]'s portrayal of the character in the [[Suicide Squad (film)|movie of the same name]]. Art by Otto Schmidt.]]\nHarley Quinn was first introduced in the ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' appearing in the style of a [[jester]]. She wore a black domino mask, white facial makeup, and a one-piece black-and-red [[motley]] outfit with a cowl.<ref name=\"auto\"/> Unlike the Joker, Harley's skin is not permanently white in the animated series, as this is reiterated in scenes showing Harley out of costume with a normal skin complexion. Dr. Harleen Quinzel, Ph.D., is portrayed as having blonde hair and blue eyes. She typically wears glasses, a skirt, high-heeled shoes, and a white lab coat.<ref name=\"auto3\">''Poison Ivy: Cycle of Life and Death'' #1. DC Comics</ref>\n\nIn her early comic book appearances until 2011, the character wore her original black-and-red costume from the animated series. In September 2011, ''[[The New 52]]'' rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Harley Quinn had a revamped look that lasted until 2016. The New 52 showed Harley Quinn with an alternating black-and-red-toned outfit with a sleeveless top, elbow pads, tight shorts, knee pads, and boots. Her hair color was altered to half-red and half-black, like the cap of her previous incarnation. Consistent with a new origin, her skin was bleached as the result of being kicked into a vat of acid by the Joker.<ref name=\"auto4\">''Suicide Squad'' #7 (May 2012). DC Comics</ref>\n\nFollowing 2016's ''[[DC Rebirth]]'', Harley Quinn debuted a new look in the third volume of her eponymous series, as well as the fifth volume of ''Suicide Squad''. Her hair color is now blonde with blue [[dip dye]] on the left side and pink dip dye on the right, and she sports two new outfits. One outfit consists of tight, blue and red shorts, a ripped tee-shirt, satin jacket, fingerless gloves, [[fishnet]] stockings, studded belt, and lace-up boots, much like [[Margot Robbie]]'s depiction of the character in the 2016 [[Suicide Squad (film)|''Suicide Squad'']] film. The character's other outfit is a two-tone, black-and-red suit consisting of a full-sleeve top, tight shorts, opaque stockings, garter belt attachments, and boots. She has also been known to wear both red-and-black colored nail polishes on both her fingernails and toenails in an alternating fashion.\n\nHarley Quinn is adorned with various tattoos, including four diamonds on her upper right thigh. Within the [[DC Extended Universe]], both Harley and the Joker have several tattoos, with Harley having them on her cheek, forearm, legs, and abdomen.\n\n==Transition to comic books and publication history==\nAfter the success of ''The Animated Series'', the character proved so popular that she was eventually added to [[Batman (comic book)|''Batman'']] comic book [[Canon (fiction)|canon]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Goldstein|first1=Hilary|title=Batman: Harley Quinn Review|url=http://au.ign.com/articles/2005/05/25/batman-harley-quinn-review|website=IGN|accessdate=12 August 2016|date=24 May 2005}}</ref> She first appeared in the Batman adventures comic then original graphic novel ''Batman: Harley Quinn'', as part of the \"[[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]\" story, although she had already appeared in the [[Elseworlds]] ''[[Batman: Thrillkiller]]'' and ''Batman: Thrillkiller '62'' in 1997. The comic book version of Quinn, like the comic book version of the Joker, is more dangerously violent and less humorously quirky than the animated series version. Despite her noticeably more violent demeanor, Harley does show mercy and compassion from time to time; she notably stops Poison Ivy from killing Batman, instead convincing her to leave the hero hanging bound and gagged from a large statue.\n\nA ''Harley Quinn'' [[ongoing series]]<ref>{{cite book|first= Alan|last=Cowsill|editor-first=Hannah|editor-last=Dolan|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|chapter= 2000s|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |location=London, England|date=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 297 |quote = Written by Karl Kesel and drawn by Terry Dodson, the double-sized first issue dealt with Harley's twisted relationship with the Joker.}}</ref> was published monthly by [[DC Comics]] for 38 issues from 2001 to 2003. Creators who contributed to the title included [[Karl Kesel]], [[Terry Dodson]], A.J. Lieberman, and Mike Huddleston. The series dealt with her going solo, eventually starting a gang and then fleeing Gotham for the city of [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] with her friend Poison Ivy. Quinn dies, only to be resurrected and then return to Gotham. The series ends with Harley turning herself into Arkham Asylum, having finally understood that she needs help. We also learn in issue #8 of the comic that Harley had a relationship in college with fellow psychology student Guy Kopski, whose suicide foreshadowed her obsession with the Joker. Harley later appears in the [[Jeph Loeb]] series [[Batman: Hush|''Hush'']]. She is next seen in a ''[[Villains United]]'' ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' special, where she is one of the many villains who escape from Arkham (although she is knocked unconscious the moment she escapes).\n\nIn the \"[[One Year Later]]\" storyline, Harley Quinn is an inmate at Arkham, glimpsed briefly in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #823 (November 2006).\n\nHarley next appeared in ''Batman'' #663 (April 2007), in which she helps the Joker with a plan to kill all his former henchmen, unaware that the \"punch line\" to the scheme is her own death. Upon realizing this, she shoots him in the shoulder.\n\nHarley resurfaces in ''Detective Comics'' #831 (June 2007), written by Paul Dini. Harley has spent the last year applying for parole, only to see her request systematically rejected by Bruce Wayne, the layman member of Arkham's medical commission. She is kidnapped by Peyton Riley, the new female [[Ventriloquist (comics)|Ventriloquist]], who offers her a job; Harley turns the job down out of respect for the memory of Arnold Wesker, the original Ventriloquist, who attempted to cheer her up during her first week in Arkham while the Joker was still on the loose. She then helps Batman and [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Jim Gordon]] foil the impostor's plans. Although Riley escapes, Bruce Wayne is impressed with Harley's effort at redemption and agrees with granting her parole.\n\n[[Birds of Prey (comics)|''Birds of Prey'']] #105 (June 2007) reveals Harley Quinn as the 6th member of the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]]. In issue #108, upon hearing that [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]] has sent the Russian authorities footage of teammate [[Deadshot]] murdering the Six's employer as payback for double-crossing them, Harley asks, \"Is it a bad time to say 'I quit'?\" thus leaving the team.\n\nIn [[Countdown (DC Comics)|''Countdown'']] #43 (July 2007), Harley appears to have reformed and is shown to be residing in an [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazon]]-run women's shelter. Having abandoned her jester costume and clown make-up, she now only wears an Amazonian [[stola]] or [[Chiton (costume)|chiton]]. She befriends the former [[Catwoman]] replacement [[Holly Robinson (comics)|Holly Robinson]] and then succeeds in persuading her to join her at the shelter, where she is working as an assistant. They are both brought to [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themiscyra]] by \"Athena\" (really [[Granny Goodness]]) and begin Amazon training. Holly and Harley then meet the real Athena and encounter [[Mary Marvel]]. The group reveals Granny's deception, and Holly, Harley, and Mary follow her as she retreats to [[Apokolips]]. Mary finds the Olympian gods, whom Granny had been holding prisoner, and the group frees them. Harley is granted powers by [[Thalia (muse)|Thalia]] as a reward. Upon returning to Earth, the powers vanish, and Harley and Holly return to [[Gotham City]].\n\n===''Gotham City Sirens''===\nHarley Quinn joins forces with [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]] (Pamela Isley) and [[Catwoman]] (Selina Kyle) in the series ''[[Gotham City Sirens]]''. Having moved in with Pamela Isley at the [[Riddler]]'s apartment, she meets up with Catwoman, who offers for the three of them to live and work together. A new villain who tries to take down Selina Kyle named the Boneblaster breaks into the apartment, and the three of them have to move after they defeat him. Later, after a chance encounter with [[Hush (comics)|Hush]], the Joker attempts to kill her, apparently out of jealousy. Quinn is rescued by Ivy and Catwoman, and it is later revealed that her attacker was not the real Joker, but one of his old henchmen impersonating him.\n\n[[File:Harleen Quinzel.jpg|thumb|200px|Dr. Harleen Quinzel, Ph.D.<ref name=\"auto3\"/> Art by [[Clay Mann]] and Seth Mann.]]\nIn ''[[Gotham City Sirens]]'' #7, Harley Quinn visits her family in [[Bensonhurst]], Brooklyn, during the holiday season. Harley's father is a swindler who is still in jail, and her brother, Barry, is a loser with dead-end dreams of rock stardom. Her mother, Sharon, wants her to stop the \"villain and hero stuff.\" The dysfunctional, \"horrible\" experience while visiting family causes her to return home to the Sirens' shared Gotham City hideout where Harley, Catwoman, and Poison Ivy spend the rest of Christmas together.<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\nFollowing a number of adventures with Catwoman and Ivy, Harley betrays them and breaks into Arkham Asylum, intending to kill the Joker for his years of abuse towards her. However, Harley ultimately chooses instead to release the Joker from his cell, and together the two orchestrate a violent takeover of the facility that results in most of the guards and staff members either being killed or taken hostage by the inmates.<ref>''Gotham City Sirens'' #20\u201323.

DC Comics</ref> Shortly afterward, Poison Ivy breaks into Harley's cell and attempts to kill her for her betrayal, but instead offers to free her if she helps her kill Catwoman, who had left both of her fellow Sirens behind in Arkham. Harley agrees, and the two set out to trap Catwoman.<ref>''Gotham City Sirens'' #25 (July 2011).

''The New 52'' shows Harley Quinn with a sleeveless top, tight shorts, and boots. Her hair color has also been altered to half-red and half-black, and her bleached white skin is the result of being kicked into a vat of acid by the Joker.<ref name=\"auto4\"/>\n\nAfter a falling out with the Joker, she goes into a murderous frenzy, directed towards people responsible for the Joker's imprisonment. Captured by the [[Black Canary]], she is forcibly inducted into the [[Suicide Squad]] by [[Amanda Waller]]. However, when she discovers that the Joker is rumored to be dead, it takes a further toll to her already-addled mind, and betraying the Suicide Squad, she puts their safety and secrecy at risk by turning herself into the Gotham Police Department in a plot to gain access to the skinned face of the Joker.<ref>''Suicide Squad'' #6 (February 2012). DC Comics</ref> Her plan pays off, and she manages to recover the face; though, in a further psychotic episode, Harley captures and ties up Deadshot and places the skinned face of the Joker over Deadshot's face, so that she can carry on a \"conversation\" with her dead lover. Deadshot lures Harley in close, shooting and severely injuring her during the conversation.<ref name=\"auto4\"/> After the Joker returns to Gotham in the \"[[Death of the Family]]\" storyline, he forces her to disguise herself in his old [[Red Hood#The Joker|Red Hood]] costume and trick the Batman into coming to the chemical plant where they first met. The Batman then falls into a tank and demands Harley to tell him where the Joker is. However, she only replies, in tears, that he is no longer the Joker she had fallen in love with.<ref>''Batman''#13 (October 2012).

In the series, Harley Quinn has become a landlady at [[Coney Island]], is a part-time member of a roller derby team, and has returned to her work in psychology under her real alias, indicating that Harley's real identity is not public knowledge in the new status quo.\n\nUnder Conner and Palmiotti's writing, Harley was reinvented as an [[antihero]] who, after being released from the Suicide Squad and having her public files erased, values human life more or less and actively tries to improve life in her neighborhood, with mixed results. While the comic book version of the character is still romantically linked with the Joker, a more recent development has Harley also romantically involved with [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]]. ''Harley Quinn'' series writers [[Jimmy Palmiotti]] and [[Amanda Conner]] confirmed that the two characters are in a non-monogamous romantic relationship.<ref>{{cite web|first=Evan|last=Narcisse|url=http://kotaku.com/dc-comics-harley-quinn-poison-ivy-are-girlfriends-w-1711038615|title=DC Comics: Harley Quinn & Poison Ivy Are Girlfriends \"Without Monogamy\"|work=[[Kotaku]]|publisher=[[Univision Communication]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=June 12, 2015|accessdate=July 15, 2018}}</ref> Between issues #11\u201313, Harley formed a brief partnership with an amnesiac [[Power Girl]] and battled the [[Clock King]] and the [[Sportsmaster]] before Power Girl's memory was restored, and she left Harley at the top of the [[Eiffel Tower]] as punishment for her deceit.<ref>''Harley Quinn'' #11\u201313 (October\u2013December 2014).

Harley agrees to help a woman whose daughter has been kidnapped by a gang in Hollywood.<ref>''Harley Quinn## #16-19(June\u2013August 2015)''</ref>\n\n''Harley Quinn'' has featured a few standalone specials which are not directly connected to the main series and feature multiple artists. In the [[scratch and sniff]]-themed ''Annual'' issue, Harley briefly returned to Gotham to save her girlfriend Poison Ivy, as the [[Arkham Asylum]] employees monitoring her had brainwashed her to create a hallucinogenic pathogen.<ref>''Harley Quinn Annual'' #1 (October 2014). DC Comics</ref> In the [[Valentines Day|''Valentine's Day'']] ''Special'', Harley returned to Gotham to win a prize date with Bruce Wayne (who, unbeknownst to her, is the Batman) and finds herself fighting animal rights activists-turned-supervillain blackmailers. She shares a brief intimate moment with Bruce Wayne. At Coney Island, Batman informs Harley that while he still distrusts her, he admires her attempt at heroism and promises not to interfere. Harley kisses the Batman and tells him to get \"lessons\" on kissing from Bruce Wayne, to which the Batman privately grins.<ref>''Harley Quinn Valentines Day Special'' #1 (Feb 2015).

The plane carrying her crashes over the ocean while flying through a storm, and Harley is washed up onto the shores of an island inhabited by an uncontacted tribe. The tribe quickly declares her a goddess and is determined to have her meet their god-king who turns out to be the [[Joker (character)|Joker]].\n\nAfter a fight and reconciliation, Harley learns that the Joker has been living on the island as a god and making the inhabitants dress up as various superheroes and track him down while playing tricks on them. It is announced that she and the Joker are to be married.

Harley has once again met up with Power Girl and even her new sidekick Terra. She has faced down multiple villains from the Penguin to the corrupt mayor of New York and is in the process of running for mayor herself when the previous mayor tried to solve the homeless problem by feeding them to cannibals. She also runs a \"vigilante for hire\" group; she calls her Gang of Harleys and has numerous other allies and stalkers, including Red Tool (a parody of Deadpool), Harley Sinn (a former nemesis) and various other allies she has made along the way. The mayor countered by kidnapping her friend Mason and killing him. Harley got revenge, and then she and Ivy went to visit with her family. On her return, a Man-Bat was seen around town, and Tony went missing. Not feeling very good after the death of Mason, Harley ordered her gang to stay out of it and was summarily ignored. They went to Arkham to ask Langstrom if he was behind it but found him gibbering in his cell. He did, however, mention that there was \"another.\" Meanwhile, Harley went hunting for the Man-Bat and took it down, only to find out it was Tony. Kidnapped moments later, they awoke in Langstrom's lab to find that his wife Francine was the newest Man-Bat, and she then jabbed Harley with the Man-Bat potion.\n\nAfter that mess, a few of her old criminal buddies, including the Penguin, the Mad Hatter, the Scarecrow, Solomon Grundy, False Face, Mr. Freeze, and numerous other Batman villains took advantage of Harley's grief over her dead friend Mason to split her from her team. This was a temporary measure, and soon, Harley freed them from mind control and apologized for some things she said while on truth serum. Working together with all of her friends and allies like Killer Croc, Poison Ivy, and Power Girl, Harley took the gang down. A few weeks later, the Riddler showed up late for the fight while Harley and her gang were eating at the reformed Condiment King's new hot dog stand, and they easily beat him up too. This was followed up by a one-shot issue in which we see a decimated future where Red Tool has tracked down Old Lady Harley at future cyborg Tony's request. We learn that she married pretty much everyone she knew at one time or another and that the world was mostly destroyed when her Gang of Harleys became several Gangs and tore each other to pieces after Coach was killed/absorbed by Brainiac. Harley finds her old original gang, beats them up, and retakes control. This leaves Coach/Brainiac in charge, and he heads out with Red Tool to go home. Back in the current time period, she recently went on a one-woman rampage on Apokolips before coming back to Earth with a new friend she rescued from Granny Goodness named Tina to deal with a realtor and a cult run by a skeleton-headed goof calling himself \"Lord Death Man\" whom she heard about on a literal pirate broadcast. It turns out that he set it up himself because he is in love with her and thought it was fun walking into her traps, being apparently unkillable. Harley used the money he paid her to save her building and surrounding businesses from a land developer, whom she then catapulted away. When last seen, Harley was reading one of her own comics and a woman calling herself Jonni DC, Continuity Cop was threatening to stop her, and the preview predicted Harley would destroy the DC Universe. After her mother was temporarily retconned and a series of pointless adventures through multiple continuities, everything was restored to normal, with the exception of an alternate past superhero with no concept of a \"gray area\" being pulled into Harley's world.\n\n====Controversy====\nIn September 2013, DC Comics announced a contest for fans and artists, \"Break into comics with Harley Quinn!\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dccomics.com/blog/2013/09/05/break-into-comics-with-harley-quinn#1|title=Break into comics with Harley Quinn!|work=DC Comics|accessdate=January 10, 2015}}</ref>, in which contestants were to draw Harley in four different suicide scenarios. This contest drew controversy not only because it was announced close to [[National Suicide Prevention Week]], but because some artists did not like the sexualized portrayal of Harley in the fourth scenario, in which Harley attempts suicide while naked in her bathtub. After seeing the reactions to the contest, DC apologized, saying they should have made it clear that it was a dream sequence that was not supposed to be taken seriously. In the final version, the bathtub scene was cut and replaced with Harley sitting on a rocket while flying in space.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/12/dc-comics-harley-quinn-suicide-_n_3913842.html | work=[[The Huffington Post]]|first=Cavan | last=Sieczkowski | title=Awful Comic Contest Asks For Drawings of Naked Woman Committing Suicide | date=September 12, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://jezebel.com/dc-comics-contest-draw-a-naked-woman-committing-suicid-1265537616|title=DC Comics Contest: Draw a Naked Woman Committing Suicide|author=Callie Beusman|work=Jezebel|accessdate=January 10, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===''Harley's Little Black Book''===\nHarley also teamed up with a lot of major DC characters in ''Harley's Little Black Book'', including Zatanna, Wonder Woman, Superman, Lobo, and a version of herself and some other superheroines in a world in which they were trying to kill [[Hitler]].\n\n===DC Universe===\nDC Comics began the next relaunch of its entire line of titles called ''[[DC Rebirth]]'' in June 2016.

Following the events of ''DC Rebirth'', Harley Quinn sports two new outfits following in ''DC Universe''. She wears tight blue-and-red shorts, a ripped white tee shirt, a satin jacket, fingerless gloves, net stockings, and boots. Her other outfit is a two-tone, black-and-red suit consisting of a full-sleeve top, tight shorts, opaque stockings, garter belt attachments, and boots. Harley Quinn is adorned with tattoos, and her hair color is blonde hair with blue [[dip dye]] on the left side and pink dip dye on the right to match the movie and her new hairstyle in ''52''.\n\nUnlike her counterpart in the ''New 52'' series (who may be a sequel to this series after Harley finishes her time on the Squad, even going so far as to erase her public criminal record despite the fact that both versions got the dip-dyed hairstyle at the same time), she is still fairly dark and resists any attempts at labeling her a hero, no matter how many lives she saves or how many times she steps up to take command of the situation. She tends to swap her carefree joking attitude for the occasional sulk. So far, the events of the Squad do little to affect the DC Universe outside of their immediate mission. She is still officially done with the Joker in a romantic capacity and still Poison Ivy's on-again, off-again girlfriend.\n\nThe ongoing fifth volume of ''Suicide Squad'' shows Harley Quinn as an unpredictable and dangerous inmate at Belle Reve Penitentiary, attacking the facility's security forces when given the opportunity.<ref name=\"auto5\"/> Harley Quinn becomes the leader of the Suicide Squad in issue #20, following Rick Flag's apparent death.

After Batgirl kills Bianca, Harley is shown killing her own family, intent on revenge in the final frames of the story.<ref>''Batman: Thrillkiller''. DC Comics</ref>\n* In the ''[[Elseworlds 80-Page Giant]]'', one of the stories is about [[Lex Luthor]] as a music producer.

DC Comics</ref>\n* On the new [[Earth-Three|Earth-3]], Harleen Quinzel is the Jokester's business manager and is killed by the [[Owlman (comics)|Owlman]].<ref>''Countdown'' #32. DC Comics</ref>\n* Harley appears in ''[[Batman/The Spirit]]''. In this crossover, Harley is one of the many villains who helps try to take down the Batman and the [[Spirit (comics)|Spirit]]. She initially appears disguised as a flight attendant.\n* In the [[Joker (graphic novel)|2008 graphic novel ''Joker'']], Harley Quinn appears as the Joker's helper and [[aide-de-camp]]. She at one point acts as a stripper (though this may be a ruse) and is never shown speaking.<ref>''Joker'' (2008). DC Comics</ref>\n* In the [[Ame-Comi Girls]] universe, Harley is partnered with the [[Catwoman]] and [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]]  as part of a trio of villains.\n* The [[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]] version of Harley Quinn is named '''Yo-Yo'''. She was a henchwoman of the [[Alternate versions of the Joker#Flashpoint|Joker]], and the [[Batman (Thomas Wayne)|Batman]] chased her down to find the Joker's location, as she had kidnapped [[Two-Face|Judge Dent]]'s children. He chased her to the ledge of the building around Crime Alley. Batman drops her off the roof, but is luckily saved by [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]].<ref>''Flashpoint'' #1</ref>\n* In ''[[Batman '66]]'', a version of Harley Quinn designed more around the 1960s television show (she is slightly taller and her hair is short; she also wears prominent slanted glasses, a long red dress and red blouse, large pearl necklace, and fairly prominent earrings) appears as '''Dr. Holly Quinn''', PhD, a psychologist at [[Arkham Asylum]], referred to as Arkham Institute for the Criminally Insane. She convinces the Joker to cooperate with Batman and Robin in exchange for approving his comedy night proposal.<ref name=\":0\">''Batman '66'' #3. DC Comics</ref> Dr. Quinn is manipulated by the Catwoman and the Joker to perfect the Joker Wave \u2014 a hysteria-inducing transmitting dish used on Gotham. Quinn is devastated by her role in the plot and to atone for her mistake, Dr. Quinn reverses the device by submitting herself to its effects \u2014 freeing the people of Gotham, but sacrificing her sanity in the process. She escapes and becomes a supervillain named Harlequin, wearing a [[roller derby]]-inspired version of the classic Harley costume. She retains her considerable intelligence and psychological training, making her a difficult foe for the Dynamic Duo, but is eventually captured when Batman and Robin disguise themselves as criminals (Batman in his regular alternate guise of [[Matches Malone]]) who beat up other bad guys who were auditioning to be Holly's henchmen.<ref>''Batman '66'' #24. DC Comics</ref>\n* Harley Quinn appears in the prequel comic to the game ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]''. She helps the Joker kidnap [[Lois Lane]] and surgically plant a trigger in her heart that will set off a nuclear bomb in Metropolis should her heart stop; when Superman accidentally kills her (thinking she is [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]]) he becomes devastated, with the grieving Superman killing the Joker as a result. Harley struggles to come to terms with the Joker's death, but develops an attachment to the Green Arrow when he kidnaps her to protect her from Superman's wrath, but is also grief-stricken when he is killed by Superman. She later confronts the Black Canary, but hesitates upon realizing she is pregnant upon vomiting mid-battle and reveals to the Black Canary that she has a four-year-old daughter named Lucy who lives with her sister. Harley and the Canary befriend each other as a result and Harley starts helping Batman's Insurgency, though most members distrust her due to her lover's actions. In ''[[Injustice 2]]'', she helps to fight Grodd's Society and Brainiac alongside the Black Canary, the Green Arrow and the other Justice League and Regime members. It is revealed in the ending that she later joins the Justice League as a fully accepted member, though she occasionally has to deal with her violent impulses. It is also revealed that her daughter thinks her mother is actually her Aunt Harley, though Harley hopes she may one day be able to tell her the truth. \n* In the ''[[Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' crossover, Harley is made into a mutant hyena by the [[Shredder (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Shredder]]. She is knocked out by the Batman in the final battle and [[Splinter (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Splinter]] uses her hammer to take down the rest of the Arkham inmates. After the Shredder is defeated, the mutagen in her system decays naturally, causing her and the rest of the mutated inmates to revert to normal.<ref>''Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' #6. DC Comics/IDW</ref>\n* In ''[[Batman: White Knight]]'', it is revealed that Harley Quinn was two different women all along. The first Harley Quinn, Harleen Quinzel, quit when the Joker captured and tortured [[Robin (character)|Robin]] ([[Jason Todd]]), and she was replaced by another girl, Marian Drews, without the Joker even realizing it. Once the Joker was cured from his insanity, he proposes marriage to Harley, only for her to beat him and mock him for acting \"normal\". The original Harley Quinn then appears, kicks the \"fake Harley\" unconscious and reveals to Jack Napier (Joker's true identity in this continuity) that there were two Harleys all along. While Harleen loved the Joker \"despite his flaws\", Marian loved the Joker by \"his flaws\". She accepts his marriage proposal and joins him in his quest to rid Gotham City of the Batman. Drews then takes the mantle of the Joker for herself \"until the real Joker returns\".<ref>''Batman: White Knight'' #2</ref><ref>''Batman: White Knight'' #3</ref>\n*In ''[[DC Comics Bombshells]]'', Harley fell in with the Joker (in this version, a gangster) after leaving Charm School, but left him when he began his journey into the occult. By the time of the events of the story, Harley is drawn to England by a voice she believes is the Joker, but turns out to be the Joker's Daughter. She rejects the Joker's Daughter's attempt to have the Joker resurrected in the body of Poison Ivy, instead beginning a relationship with Ivy herself.\n* In ''[[Batman: Damned]]'' Harley snaps after the Joker's mysterious death following a battle with Batman and performs surgery on herself and dressing herself to make her resemble the Joker. Harley leads the Joker's remaining henchman on a revenge mission, blowing up several buildings and taking over the GCPD building and defacing the Batsignal so that it resembles the Joker's smile. Batman arrives and defeats the henchman before Harley paralyzes him with a toxin, beats him with her baseball bat, and attempts to sexually abuse him. Batman is then possessed by the Enchantress, and strangles Harley against the Batsignal.<ref>''Batman: Damned'' #2</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n===Film===\n====Live-action====\n* Harley Quinn was initially set to appear in ''Batman Unchained'', the fifth film planned for the original Batman film series.<ref>{{cite web|first=Kelly|last=Konda|url=https://weminoredinfilm.com/2015/06/15/the-inside-story-on-5-batman-movies-which-almost-got-made-before-batman-begins/|title=The Inside Story on 5 Batman Movies Which Almost Got Made Before Batman Begins|website=We Majored in Film|date=June 15, 2015|accessdate=June 23, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|first=Michael|last=Fleming|url = https://www.variety.com/article/VR1116680121|title = Schumacher trims sails|magazine = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date = November 11, 1997|accessdate =November 11, 2008}}</ref> She was to be featured as the Joker's ([[Jack Nicholson]]) daughter, who allies herself with the [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]] to get revenge on Batman for her father's death.<ref>{{cite news|last=Linder|first=Brian|url = http://movies.ign.com/articles/034/034019p1.html|title = Rumblings From Gotham|website = [[IGN]]|publisher=[[j2 Global]]|location=San Francisco, California|date = July 27, 2000|accessdate =October 17, 2008}}</ref> Due to the critical and commercial failure of [[Batman & Robin (film)|''Batman & Robin'']], however, this film was cancelled.\n* The ''[[Batman: Arkham]]'' version of Harley makes a cameo appearance in the 2018 film ''[[Ready Player One (film)|Ready Player One]]'' in The Distracted Globe nightclub sequence.<ref>{{cite web|author=Chris Begley |url=https://batman-news.com/2017/12/11/joker-harley-quinn-ready-player-one-trailer/ |title=The Joker and Harley Quinn appear in 'Ready Player One' trailer |publisher=Batman News |date= |accessdate=December 11, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=====DC Extended Universe=====\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Margot Robbie]] as Harley Quinn in a publicity still for ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]'' (2016)]] -->\n[[Margot Robbie]] portrays Dr. Harleen Quinzel / Harley Quinn in the [[DC Extended Universe]].<ref name=AdditionalCast>{{cite news|title='Suicide Squad': First Cast Photo Revealed|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/suicide-squad-first-cast-photo-revealed-1201468975/|accessdate=April 9, 2015|work=variety.com|date=July 25, 2015}}</ref>\n* The character debuted in the [[2016 in film|2016 film]] ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]''.

By this time, Harley has dyed her hair completely black and wears almost all black, with a \"J\" necklace and mourning veil.\n* Harley Quinn appears in ''[[Batman: Arkham City Lockdown]]'', where she kidnaps a reporter to use as a hostage to free the Joker.

Quinzel is last seen escorting the Joker to his cell after he is defeated by the Batman in the game's ending.\n* In the main story of ''[[Batman: Arkham Knight]]'', it is revealed that in between the events of ''Arkham City'' and the current game, she has become a very competent gang leader, having recovered control of the Joker's former gang (including the members that were plotting to overthrow her or desert her) and has even become one of Gotham's main gang leaders, recruited by the Scarecrow in his plan to kill the Batman. She tries to break free and recruit the victims of the Joker's blood transfusion who were not affected by the cure, all of whom started to display traces of his appearance and behavior, but they all end up dead after she was betrayed by one of the Joker patients that was working with her.\n** Apart from the main game, she is a playable character via downloadable content that was once a pre-order exclusive.

Attempting to avoid her father's fate, she joins a criminal organisation called the Pact to steal a virus that will be able to cure her hereditary condition. This depiction initially reverses the dynamic between Harley and the Joker. Quinn manipulates and abuses her former patient at Arkham  Asylum, named \"John Doe\", who is infatuated with her. As the series progresses, John's confidence will increase and, depending on the player's choices, he will either aid Bruce Wayne in capturing Quinn or transform into the traditional version of the Joker.

Created by [[Paul Dini]] and [[Bruce Timm]] as a new [[supervillain]] and romantic interest for the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' in September 1992, she was later adapted into [[DC Comics]]' [[Batman]] comic book [[Canon (fiction)|canon]], beginning with ''[[The Batman Adventures]]'' #12 (September 1993). The character is also referred to by such epithets as the Cupid of Crime and the Maiden of Mischief.<ref>https://theplaylist.net/harley-quinn-trailer-20191112/</ref><ref>https://www.criticalhit.net/entertainment/birds-of-prey-101-how-harley-quinn-became-dcs-favourite-maiden-of-mischief/</ref>\n\nHarley Quinn is a frequent accomplice and lover of the Joker, who was her patient when she worked as an intern [[psychologist]] at [[Gotham City]]'s [[Arkham Asylum]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=Eury/> Her alias is a play on the name \"[[Harlequin]],\" a character that originated in [[commedia dell'arte]].

Since then, she has appeared in various other DC projects voiced by actors such as [[Tara Strong]], [[Hynden Walch]], [[Laura Bailey (actress)|Laura Bailey]], [[Jenny Slate]], [[Melissa Rauch]], [[Laura Post]], and [[Kaley Cuoco]]; the latter provided the voice for Harley Quinn in her own [[Harley Quinn (TV series)|animated series]]. Harley Quinn made her live-action cinematic debut in the 2016 [[DC Extended Universe]] film ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]'', portrayed by [[Margot Robbie]] who reprised her role in ''[[Birds of Prey (2020 film)|Birds of Prey]]'' (2020) and will next appear in ''[[The Suicide Squad (film)|The Suicide Squad]]'' (2021).\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==History==\n===Creation===\n====Introduction====\nHarley Quinn first appeared in the [[DC Animated Universe]]'s ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' episode \"[[Joker's Favor]],\"<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite episode|title=Joker's Favor|episodelink=Joker's Favor|series=Batman: The Animated Series|serieslink=Batman: The Animated Series|season=1|number=|airdate=September 11, 1992|network=[[20th Century Fox|Fox]]}}</ref> in what was initially supposed to be the animated equivalent of a [[Bit part|walk-on]] role; several police officers were to be taken hostage by someone jumping out of a cake, and it was decided that to have the Joker do so himself would be too bizarre, although he ended up doing it anyway. Thus they created a female sidekick for the Joker; she would become his love interest. [[Arleen Sorkin]], a former star of the soap opera ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'', appeared in a dream sequence on that series in which she wore a [[jester]] costume; They used this scene as an inspiration for Quinn.<ref>{{cite web| first = Pat | last = Jankiewicz| title = Quinn-tessentials.

Written and drawn by Dini and Timm, the comic book is told in the style and continuity of ''Batman: The Animated Series''. It describes Dr. Harleen Frances Quinzel, Ph.D. as an [[Arkham Asylum]] [[Psychiatrist|psychologist]] who falls in love with the Joker and becomes his accomplice and on-again, off-again girlfriend. The story received wide praise<ref>{{cite web|first=Hilary|last=Goldstein|url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/618/618636p1.html|title=The Batman Adventures: Mad Love Review|website=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[j2 Global]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=May 24, 2005|accessdate=July 15, 2018}}</ref> and won the [[Eisner Award|Eisner]] and [[Harvey Award|Harvey Awards]] for Best Single Issue Comic of the Year.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.hahnlibrary.net/comics/awards/eisner94.php |title=Will Eisner Comic Industry Award Nominees and Winners|journal=Comic Book Awards Almanac|publisher=The Hahn Library|date=1994}}</ref> ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'' series adapted ''Mad Love'' as an episode of the same name in 1999. It was the second \"animated style\" comic book adapted for the series, with the other being \"Holiday Knights.\"\n\nHarleen Quinzel becomes fascinated with the Joker while working at Arkham Asylum and volunteers to help treat him. She falls hopelessly in love with the Joker during their sessions, and she helps him escape from the asylum more than once. When Batman returns a severely injured Joker to Arkham, she dons a jester costume to become Harley Quinn, the Joker's sidekick. The Joker frequently insults, ignores, hurts, and even tries to kill Harley, but she always comes back to him, convinced that he genuinely loves her.\n\n===Expanded role===\nAfter ''Batman: The Animated Series'' and ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'', Harley makes several other animated appearances. She appears as one of the four main female characters of the [[Flash animation|web cartoon]] ''[[Gotham Girls]]''. She also made guest appearances in other cartoons within the [[DC animated universe]], appearing alongside the Joker in the [[Justice League (TV series)|''Justice League'']] episode \"Wild Cards\" and alongside [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]] in the ''[[Static Shock]]'' episode \"Hard as Nails.\"\n\nHarley Quinn appears in [[The Batman/Superman Movie|''World's Finest: The Batman/Superman Movie'']] (a compilation movie consisting of three-part ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' episode \"World's Finest\") as a rival and [[Foil (literature)|foil]] for [[Lex Luthor]]'s assistant [[Mercy Graves]]; each takes an immediate dislike for the other, at one point fighting brutally with each other as Lex Luthor and the Joker have a business meeting. In the film's [[Climax (narrative)|climax]], Harley ties Graves as a human shield to a combat robot set to confront [[Superman]] and [[Batman]], but Graves is rescued by the two heroes without suffering any harm.\n\nThe animated movie ''[[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker]]'' takes place in the future, long after the events in ''Batman: The Animated Series''. It includes a flashback scene in which Harley helps the Joker torture [[Tim Drake]] until he has become \"Joker Jr.,\" an insane miniature version of the Clown Prince of Crime; she then falls down a deep pit during a battle with [[Batgirl]]. At the end of the movie, a pair of twin girls who model themselves on the Joker are released on bail to their grandmother, who angrily berates them \u2014 to which they answer: \"Oh, shut up, Nana Harley!\" Prior to this, her costume made several appearances in episodes in the future [[Batcave]].\n\n==Characterization==\n===Harleen Quinzel===\nDr. Harleen Frances Quinzel is depicted as having been a [[psychiatrist]]<ref name=Eury>Michael Eury (ed.), [https://books.google.com/books?id= ''Back Issue'' #99], TwoMorrows Publishing, 2017, p. 69, \"Before she was Harley Quinn, she was the Joker's psychiatrist. ...

''Gotham City Sirens'' #7 (Feb. 2010) shows Harley visiting her family for the holiday season, in which they are portrayed as being very dysfunctional.

Her redesign brings her in line with [[Margot Robbie]]'s portrayal of the character in the [[Suicide Squad (film)|movie of the same name]]. Art by Otto Schmidt.]]\nHarley Quinn was first introduced in the ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' appearing in the style of a [[jester]]. She wore a black domino mask, white facial makeup, and a one-piece black-and-red [[motley]] outfit with a cowl.<ref name=\"auto\"/> Unlike the Joker, Harley's skin is not permanently white in the animated series, as this is reiterated in scenes showing Harley out of costume with a normal skin complexion. Dr. Harleen Quinzel, Ph.D., is portrayed as having blonde hair and blue eyes. She typically wears glasses, a skirt, high-heeled shoes, and a white lab coat.<ref name=\"auto3\">''Poison Ivy: Cycle of Life and Death'' #1. DC Comics</ref>\n\nIn her early comic book appearances until 2011, the character wore her original black-and-red costume from the animated series. In September 2011, ''[[The New 52]]'' rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Harley Quinn had a revamped look that lasted until 2016. The New 52 showed Harley Quinn with an alternating black-and-red-toned outfit with a sleeveless top, elbow pads, tight shorts, knee pads, and boots. Her hair color was altered to half-red and half-black, like the cap of her previous incarnation. Consistent with a new origin, her skin was bleached as the result of being kicked into a vat of acid by the Joker.<ref name=\"auto4\">''Suicide Squad'' #7 (May 2012). DC Comics</ref>\n\nFollowing 2016's ''[[DC Rebirth]]'', Harley Quinn debuted a new look in the third volume of her eponymous series, as well as the fifth volume of ''Suicide Squad''. Her hair color is now blonde with blue [[dip dye]] on the left side and pink dip dye on the right, and she sports two new outfits. One outfit consists of tight, blue and red shorts, a ripped tee-shirt, satin jacket, fingerless gloves, [[fishnet]] stockings, studded belt, and lace-up boots, much like [[Margot Robbie]]'s depiction of the character in the 2016 [[Suicide Squad (film)|''Suicide Squad'']] film. The character's other outfit is a two-tone, black-and-red suit consisting of a full-sleeve top, tight shorts, opaque stockings, garter belt attachments, and boots. She has also been known to wear both red-and-black colored nail polishes on both her fingernails and toenails in an alternating fashion.\n\nHarley Quinn is adorned with various tattoos, including four diamonds on her upper right thigh. Within the [[DC Extended Universe]], both Harley and the Joker have several tattoos, with Harley having them on her cheek, forearm, legs, and abdomen.\n\n==Transition to comic books and publication history==\nAfter the success of ''The Animated Series'', the character proved so popular that she was eventually added to [[Batman (comic book)|''Batman'']] comic book [[Canon (fiction)|canon]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Goldstein|first1=Hilary|title=Batman: Harley Quinn Review|url=http://au.ign.com/articles/2005/05/25/batman-harley-quinn-review|website=IGN|accessdate=12 August 2016|date=24 May 2005}}</ref> She first appeared in the Batman adventures comic then original graphic novel ''Batman: Harley Quinn'', as part of the \"[[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]\" story, although she had already appeared in the [[Elseworlds]] ''[[Batman: Thrillkiller]]'' and ''Batman: Thrillkiller '62'' in 1997. The comic book version of Quinn, like the comic book version of the Joker, is more dangerously violent and less humorously quirky than the animated series version. Despite her noticeably more violent demeanor, Harley does show mercy and compassion from time to time; she notably stops Poison Ivy from killing Batman, instead convincing her to leave the hero hanging bound and gagged from a large statue.\n\nA ''Harley Quinn'' [[ongoing series]]<ref>{{cite book|first= Alan|last=Cowsill|editor-first=Hannah|editor-last=Dolan|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|chapter= 2000s|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |location=London, England|date=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 297 |quote = Written by Karl Kesel and drawn by Terry Dodson, the double-sized first issue dealt with Harley's twisted relationship with the Joker.}}</ref> was published monthly by [[DC Comics]] for 38 issues from 2001 to 2003. Creators who contributed to the title included [[Karl Kesel]], [[Terry Dodson]], A.J. Lieberman, and Mike Huddleston. The series dealt with her going solo, eventually starting a gang and then fleeing Gotham for the city of [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] with her friend Poison Ivy. Quinn dies, only to be resurrected and then return to Gotham. The series ends with Harley turning herself into Arkham Asylum, having finally understood that she needs help. We also learn in issue #8 of the comic that Harley had a relationship in college with fellow psychology student Guy Kopski, whose suicide foreshadowed her obsession with the Joker. Harley later appears in the [[Jeph Loeb]] series [[Batman: Hush|''Hush'']]. She is next seen in a ''[[Villains United]]'' ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' special, where she is one of the many villains who escape from Arkham (although she is knocked unconscious the moment she escapes).\n\nIn the \"[[One Year Later]]\" storyline, Harley Quinn is an inmate at Arkham, glimpsed briefly in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #823 (November 2006).\n\nHarley next appeared in ''Batman'' #663 (April 2007), in which she helps the Joker with a plan to kill all his former henchmen, unaware that the \"punch line\" to the scheme is her own death. Upon realizing this, she shoots him in the shoulder.\n\nHarley resurfaces in ''Detective Comics'' #831 (June 2007), written by Paul Dini. Harley has spent the last year applying for parole, only to see her request systematically rejected by Bruce Wayne, the layman member of Arkham's medical commission. She is kidnapped by Peyton Riley, the new female [[Ventriloquist (comics)|Ventriloquist]], who offers her a job; Harley turns the job down out of respect for the memory of Arnold Wesker, the original Ventriloquist, who attempted to cheer her up during her first week in Arkham while the Joker was still on the loose. She then helps Batman and [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Jim Gordon]] foil the impostor's plans. Although Riley escapes, Bruce Wayne is impressed with Harley's effort at redemption and agrees with granting her parole.\n\n[[Birds of Prey (comics)|''Birds of Prey'']] #105 (June 2007) reveals Harley Quinn as the 6th member of the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]]. In issue #108, upon hearing that [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]] has sent the Russian authorities footage of teammate [[Deadshot]] murdering the Six's employer as payback for double-crossing them, Harley asks, \"Is it a bad time to say 'I quit'?\" thus leaving the team.\n\nIn [[Countdown (DC Comics)|''Countdown'']] #43 (July 2007), Harley appears to have reformed and is shown to be residing in an [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazon]]-run women's shelter. Having abandoned her jester costume and clown make-up, she now only wears an Amazonian [[stola]] or [[Chiton (costume)|chiton]]. She befriends the former [[Catwoman]] replacement [[Holly Robinson (comics)|Holly Robinson]] and then succeeds in persuading her to join her at the shelter, where she is working as an assistant. They are both brought to [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themiscyra]] by \"Athena\" (really [[Granny Goodness]]) and begin Amazon training. Holly and Harley then meet the real Athena and encounter [[Mary Marvel]]. The group reveals Granny's deception, and Holly, Harley, and Mary follow her as she retreats to [[Apokolips]]. Mary finds the Olympian gods, whom Granny had been holding prisoner, and the group frees them. Harley is granted powers by [[Thalia (muse)|Thalia]] as a reward. Upon returning to Earth, the powers vanish, and Harley and Holly return to [[Gotham City]].\n\n===''Gotham City Sirens''===\nHarley Quinn joins forces with [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]] (Pamela Isley) and [[Catwoman]] (Selina Kyle) in the series ''[[Gotham City Sirens]]''. Having moved in with Pamela Isley at the [[Riddler]]'s apartment, she meets up with Catwoman, who offers for the three of them to live and work together. A new villain who tries to take down Selina Kyle named the Boneblaster breaks into the apartment, and the three of them have to move after they defeat him. Later, after a chance encounter with [[Hush (comics)|Hush]], the Joker attempts to kill her, apparently out of jealousy. Quinn is rescued by Ivy and Catwoman, and it is later revealed that her attacker was not the real Joker, but one of his old henchmen impersonating him.\n\n[[File:Harleen Quinzel.jpg|thumb|200px|Dr. Harleen Quinzel, Ph.D.<ref name=\"auto3\"/> Art by [[Clay Mann]] and Seth Mann.]]\nIn ''[[Gotham City Sirens]]'' #7, Harley Quinn visits her family in [[Bensonhurst]], Brooklyn, during the holiday season. Harley's father is a swindler who is still in jail, and her brother, Barry, is a loser with dead-end dreams of rock stardom. Her mother, Sharon, wants her to stop the \"villain and hero stuff.\" The dysfunctional, \"horrible\" experience while visiting family causes her to return home to the Sirens' shared Gotham City hideout where Harley, Catwoman, and Poison Ivy spend the rest of Christmas together.<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\nFollowing a number of adventures with Catwoman and Ivy, Harley betrays them and breaks into Arkham Asylum, intending to kill the Joker for his years of abuse towards her. However, Harley ultimately chooses instead to release the Joker from his cell, and together the two orchestrate a violent takeover of the facility that results in most of the guards and staff members either being killed or taken hostage by the inmates.<ref>''Gotham City Sirens'' #20\u201323.

DC Comics</ref> Shortly afterward, Poison Ivy breaks into Harley's cell and attempts to kill her for her betrayal, but instead offers to free her if she helps her kill Catwoman, who had left both of her fellow Sirens behind in Arkham. Harley agrees, and the two set out to trap Catwoman.<ref>''Gotham City Sirens'' #25 (July 2011). DC Comics</ref> During the ensuing fight, Catwoman says that she saw good in them and only wanted to help. Just as Batman is about to arrest them, Catwoman helps the two of them escape.<ref>''Gotham City Sirens'' #26 (August 2011).

Harley appears in the debut issue as Dr. Harleen Quinzel, Ph.D., with continued appearances throughout the series.<ref name=\"auto3\"/>\n\n===The New 52/Harley Quinn Rebirth===\nFollowing DC's [[The New 52|2011 relaunch]] of its titles, Harley Quinn's costume and appearance were fully revamped. ''The New 52'' shows Harley Quinn with a sleeveless top, tight shorts, and boots. Her hair color has also been altered to half-red and half-black, and her bleached white skin is the result of being kicked into a vat of acid by the Joker.<ref name=\"auto4\"/>\n\nAfter a falling out with the Joker, she goes into a murderous frenzy, directed towards people responsible for the Joker's imprisonment. Captured by the [[Black Canary]], she is forcibly inducted into the [[Suicide Squad]] by [[Amanda Waller]]. However, when she discovers that the Joker is rumored to be dead, it takes a further toll to her already-addled mind, and betraying the Suicide Squad, she puts their safety and secrecy at risk by turning herself into the Gotham Police Department in a plot to gain access to the skinned face of the Joker.<ref>''Suicide Squad'' #6 (February 2012). DC Comics</ref> Her plan pays off, and she manages to recover the face; though, in a further psychotic episode, Harley captures and ties up Deadshot and places the skinned face of the Joker over Deadshot's face, so that she can carry on a \"conversation\" with her dead lover. Deadshot lures Harley in close, shooting and severely injuring her during the conversation.<ref name=\"auto4\"/> After the Joker returns to Gotham in the \"[[Death of the Family]]\" storyline, he forces her to disguise herself in his old [[Red Hood#The Joker|Red Hood]] costume and trick the Batman into coming to the chemical plant where they first met. The Batman then falls into a tank and demands Harley to tell him where the Joker is. However, she only replies, in tears, that he is no longer the Joker she had fallen in love with.<ref>''Batman''#13 (October 2012).

In the series, Harley Quinn has become a landlady at [[Coney Island]], is a part-time member of a roller derby team, and has returned to her work in psychology under her real alias, indicating that Harley's real identity is not public knowledge in the new status quo.\n\nUnder Conner and Palmiotti's writing, Harley was reinvented as an [[antihero]] who, after being released from the Suicide Squad and having her public files erased, values human life more or less and actively tries to improve life in her neighborhood, with mixed results. While the comic book version of the character is still romantically linked with the Joker, a more recent development has Harley also romantically involved with [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]]. ''Harley Quinn'' series writers [[Jimmy Palmiotti]] and [[Amanda Conner]] confirmed that the two characters are in a non-monogamous romantic relationship.<ref>{{cite web|first=Evan|last=Narcisse|url=http://kotaku.com/dc-comics-harley-quinn-poison-ivy-are-girlfriends-w-1711038615|title=DC Comics: Harley Quinn & Poison Ivy Are Girlfriends \"Without Monogamy\"|work=[[Kotaku]]|publisher=[[Univision Communication]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=June 12, 2015|accessdate=July 15, 2018}}</ref> Between issues #11\u201313, Harley formed a brief partnership with an amnesiac [[Power Girl]] and battled the [[Clock King]] and the [[Sportsmaster]] before Power Girl's memory was restored, and she left Harley at the top of the [[Eiffel Tower]] as punishment for her deceit.<ref>''Harley Quinn'' #11\u201313 (October\u2013December 2014).

Harley agrees to help a woman whose daughter has been kidnapped by a gang in Hollywood.<ref>''Harley Quinn## #16-19(June\u2013August 2015)''</ref>\n\n''Harley Quinn'' has featured a few standalone specials which are not directly connected to the main series and feature multiple artists. In the [[scratch and sniff]]-themed ''Annual'' issue, Harley briefly returned to Gotham to save her girlfriend Poison Ivy, as the [[Arkham Asylum]] employees monitoring her had brainwashed her to create a hallucinogenic pathogen.<ref>''Harley Quinn Annual'' #1 (October 2014). DC Comics</ref> In the [[Valentines Day|''Valentine's Day'']] ''Special'', Harley returned to Gotham to win a prize date with Bruce Wayne (who, unbeknownst to her, is the Batman) and finds herself fighting animal rights activists-turned-supervillain blackmailers. She shares a brief intimate moment with Bruce Wayne. At Coney Island, Batman informs Harley that while he still distrusts her, he admires her attempt at heroism and promises not to interfere. Harley kisses the Batman and tells him to get \"lessons\" on kissing from Bruce Wayne, to which the Batman privately grins.<ref>''Harley Quinn Valentines Day Special'' #1 (Feb 2015).

The plane carrying her crashes over the ocean while flying through a storm, and Harley is washed up onto the shores of an island inhabited by an uncontacted tribe. The tribe quickly declares her a goddess and is determined to have her meet their god-king who turns out to be the [[Joker (character)|Joker]].\n\nAfter a fight and reconciliation, Harley learns that the Joker has been living on the island as a god and making the inhabitants dress up as various superheroes and track him down while playing tricks on them. It is announced that she and the Joker are to be married. She is initially excited about the pending marriage, until she discovers that the two will be sacrificed to the island's volcano as their wedding ceremony ends.<ref>\"Future's End: Harley Quinn\" (2014).

Harley has once again met up with Power Girl and even her new sidekick Terra. She has faced down multiple villains from the Penguin to the corrupt mayor of New York and is in the process of running for mayor herself when the previous mayor tried to solve the homeless problem by feeding them to cannibals. She also runs a \"vigilante for hire\" group; she calls her Gang of Harleys and has numerous other allies and stalkers, including Red Tool (a parody of Deadpool), Harley Sinn (a former nemesis) and various other allies she has made along the way. The mayor countered by kidnapping her friend Mason and killing him. Harley got revenge, and then she and Ivy went to visit with her family. On her return, a Man-Bat was seen around town, and Tony went missing. Not feeling very good after the death of Mason, Harley ordered her gang to stay out of it and was summarily ignored. They went to Arkham to ask Langstrom if he was behind it but found him gibbering in his cell. He did, however, mention that there was \"another.\" Meanwhile, Harley went hunting for the Man-Bat and took it down, only to find out it was Tony. Kidnapped moments later, they awoke in Langstrom's lab to find that his wife Francine was the newest Man-Bat, and she then jabbed Harley with the Man-Bat potion.\n\nAfter that mess, a few of her old criminal buddies, including the Penguin, the Mad Hatter, the Scarecrow, Solomon Grundy, False Face, Mr. Freeze, and numerous other Batman villains took advantage of Harley's grief over her dead friend Mason to split her from her team. This was a temporary measure, and soon, Harley freed them from mind control and apologized for some things she said while on truth serum. Working together with all of her friends and allies like Killer Croc, Poison Ivy, and Power Girl, Harley took the gang down. A few weeks later, the Riddler showed up late for the fight while Harley and her gang were eating at the reformed Condiment King's new hot dog stand, and they easily beat him up too. This was followed up by a one-shot issue in which we see a decimated future where Red Tool has tracked down Old Lady Harley at future cyborg Tony's request. We learn that she married pretty much everyone she knew at one time or another and that the world was mostly destroyed when her Gang of Harleys became several Gangs and tore each other to pieces after Coach was killed/absorbed by Brainiac. Harley finds her old original gang, beats them up, and retakes control. This leaves Coach/Brainiac in charge, and he heads out with Red Tool to go home. Back in the current time period, she recently went on a one-woman rampage on Apokolips before coming back to Earth with a new friend she rescued from Granny Goodness named Tina to deal with a realtor and a cult run by a skeleton-headed goof calling himself \"Lord Death Man\" whom she heard about on a literal pirate broadcast. It turns out that he set it up himself because he is in love with her and thought it was fun walking into her traps, being apparently unkillable. Harley used the money he paid her to save her building and surrounding businesses from a land developer, whom she then catapulted away. When last seen, Harley was reading one of her own comics and a woman calling herself Jonni DC, Continuity Cop was threatening to stop her, and the preview predicted Harley would destroy the DC Universe. After her mother was temporarily retconned and a series of pointless adventures through multiple continuities, everything was restored to normal, with the exception of an alternate past superhero with no concept of a \"gray area\" being pulled into Harley's world.\n\n====Controversy====\nIn September 2013, DC Comics announced a contest for fans and artists, \"Break into comics with Harley Quinn!\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dccomics.com/blog/2013/09/05/break-into-comics-with-harley-quinn#1|title=Break into comics with Harley Quinn!|work=DC Comics|accessdate=January 10, 2015}}</ref>, in which contestants were to draw Harley in four different suicide scenarios. This contest drew controversy not only because it was announced close to [[National Suicide Prevention Week]], but because some artists did not like the sexualized portrayal of Harley in the fourth scenario, in which Harley attempts suicide while naked in her bathtub. After seeing the reactions to the contest, DC apologized, saying they should have made it clear that it was a dream sequence that was not supposed to be taken seriously. In the final version, the bathtub scene was cut and replaced with Harley sitting on a rocket while flying in space.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/12/dc-comics-harley-quinn-suicide-_n_3913842.html | work=[[The Huffington Post]]|first=Cavan | last=Sieczkowski | title=Awful Comic Contest Asks For Drawings of Naked Woman Committing Suicide | date=September 12, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://jezebel.com/dc-comics-contest-draw-a-naked-woman-committing-suicid-1265537616|title=DC Comics Contest: Draw a Naked Woman Committing Suicide|author=Callie Beusman|work=Jezebel|accessdate=January 10, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===''Harley's Little Black Book''===\nHarley also teamed up with a lot of major DC characters in ''Harley's Little Black Book'', including Zatanna, Wonder Woman, Superman, Lobo, and a version of herself and some other superheroines in a world in which they were trying to kill [[Hitler]].\n\n===DC Universe===\nDC Comics began the next relaunch of its entire line of titles called ''[[DC Rebirth]]'' in June 2016.

Following the events of ''DC Rebirth'', Harley Quinn sports two new outfits following in ''DC Universe''. She wears tight blue-and-red shorts, a ripped white tee shirt, a satin jacket, fingerless gloves, net stockings, and boots. Her other outfit is a two-tone, black-and-red suit consisting of a full-sleeve top, tight shorts, opaque stockings, garter belt attachments, and boots. Harley Quinn is adorned with tattoos, and her hair color is blonde hair with blue [[dip dye]] on the left side and pink dip dye on the right to match the movie and her new hairstyle in ''52''.\n\nUnlike her counterpart in the ''New 52'' series (who may be a sequel to this series after Harley finishes her time on the Squad, even going so far as to erase her public criminal record despite the fact that both versions got the dip-dyed hairstyle at the same time), she is still fairly dark and resists any attempts at labeling her a hero, no matter how many lives she saves or how many times she steps up to take command of the situation. She tends to swap her carefree joking attitude for the occasional sulk. So far, the events of the Squad do little to affect the DC Universe outside of their immediate mission. She is still officially done with the Joker in a romantic capacity and still Poison Ivy's on-again, off-again girlfriend.\n\nThe ongoing fifth volume of ''Suicide Squad'' shows Harley Quinn as an unpredictable and dangerous inmate at Belle Reve Penitentiary, attacking the facility's security forces when given the opportunity.<ref name=\"auto5\"/> Harley Quinn becomes the leader of the Suicide Squad in issue #20, following Rick Flag's apparent death. The members of the team under Harley's leadership include [[Captain Boomerang]], [[Deadshot]], the [[Enchantress (DC Comics)|Enchantress]], [[Katana (comics)|Katana]], and [[Killer Croc]].\n\n====Harley Quinn DC Black Label====\n\nHarley Quinn is a major character in DC's first [[DC Black Label|''Black Label'']] comic series, an adult-focused imprint, in Sean Murphy's 8-part standalone story ''Batman: White Knight'' (more information provided in other versions section).\n\n''Harleen'', a limited series created by [[Stjepan \u0160eji\u0107|Stjepan Sejic]], due to debut on September 25, will provide new insight into the character's origin story and will be her first solo comic series within the new imprint.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dccomics.com/blog/2019/06/14/dc-black-label-reimagines-harley-quinn%E2%80%99s-origin-in-harleen-from-writer-and-artist|title=DC BLACK LABEL REIMAGINES HARLEY QUINN'S ORIGIN IN HARLEEN FROM WRITER AND ARTIST STJEPAN \u0160EJI\u0106|date=2019-06-14|website=DC|language=en|access-date=2019-06-18}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to her own origin story, Harley Quinn will also feature in Kami Garcia, Mike Mayhew, and Mico Suayan's ''Joker/Harley: Criminal Sanity.''

She escapes and becomes a supervillain named Harlequin, wearing a [[roller derby]]-inspired version of the classic Harley costume.

DC Comics</ref>\n* Harley Quinn appears in the prequel comic to the game ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]''. She helps the Joker kidnap [[Lois Lane]] and surgically plant a trigger in her heart that will set off a nuclear bomb in Metropolis should her heart stop; when Superman accidentally kills her (thinking she is [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]]) he becomes devastated, with the grieving Superman killing the Joker as a result. Harley struggles to come to terms with the Joker's death, but develops an attachment to the Green Arrow when he kidnaps her to protect her from Superman's wrath, but is also grief-stricken when he is killed by Superman. She later confronts the Black Canary, but hesitates upon realizing she is pregnant upon vomiting mid-battle and reveals to the Black Canary that she has a four-year-old daughter named Lucy who lives with her sister. Harley and the Canary befriend each other as a result and Harley starts helping Batman's Insurgency, though most members distrust her due to her lover's actions. In ''[[Injustice 2]]'', she helps to fight Grodd's Society and Brainiac alongside the Black Canary, the Green Arrow and the other Justice League and Regime members. It is revealed in the ending that she later joins the Justice League as a fully accepted member, though she occasionally has to deal with her violent impulses. It is also revealed that her daughter thinks her mother is actually her Aunt Harley, though Harley hopes she may one day be able to tell her the truth. \n* In the ''[[Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' crossover, Harley is made into a mutant hyena by the [[Shredder (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Shredder]]. She is knocked out by the Batman in the final battle and [[Splinter (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Splinter]] uses her hammer to take down the rest of the Arkham inmates. After the Shredder is defeated, the mutagen in her system decays naturally, causing her and the rest of the mutated inmates to revert to normal.<ref>''Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' #6. DC Comics/IDW</ref>\n* In ''[[Batman: White Knight]]'', it is revealed that Harley Quinn was two different women all along. The first Harley Quinn, Harleen Quinzel, quit when the Joker captured and tortured [[Robin (character)|Robin]] ([[Jason Todd]]), and she was replaced by another girl, Marian Drews, without the Joker even realizing it. Once the Joker was cured from his insanity, he proposes marriage to Harley, only for her to beat him and mock him for acting \"normal\". The original Harley Quinn then appears, kicks the \"fake Harley\" unconscious and reveals to Jack Napier (Joker's true identity in this continuity) that there were two Harleys all along. While Harleen loved the Joker \"despite his flaws\", Marian loved the Joker by \"his flaws\". She accepts his marriage proposal and joins him in his quest to rid Gotham City of the Batman. Drews then takes the mantle of the Joker for herself \"until the real Joker returns\".<ref>''Batman: White Knight'' #2</ref><ref>''Batman: White Knight'' #3</ref>\n*In ''[[DC Comics Bombshells]]'', Harley fell in with the Joker (in this version, a gangster) after leaving Charm School, but left him when he began his journey into the occult. By the time of the events of the story, Harley is drawn to England by a voice she believes is the Joker, but turns out to be the Joker's Daughter. She rejects the Joker's Daughter's attempt to have the Joker resurrected in the body of Poison Ivy, instead beginning a relationship with Ivy herself.\n* In ''[[Batman: Damned]]'' Harley snaps after the Joker's mysterious death following a battle with Batman and performs surgery on herself and dressing herself to make her resemble the Joker.

Attempting to avoid her father's fate, she joins a criminal organisation called the Pact to steal a virus that will be able to cure her hereditary condition. This depiction initially reverses the dynamic between Harley and the Joker. Quinn manipulates and abuses her former patient at Arkham  Asylum, named \"John Doe\", who is infatuated with her. As the series progresses, John's confidence will increase and, depending on the player's choices, he will either aid Bruce Wayne in capturing Quinn or transform into the traditional version of the Joker. In the latter outcome, Harley will become the Joker's girlfriend and the two use the virus to threaten Gotham City.\n\n==== Other appearances ====\n* Harley Quinn appears in ''[[Infinite Crisis (video game)|Infinite Crisis]]'' as a playable character, voiced by Tara Strong.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUPZxr2Y7zM|title=Infinite Crisis \u2013 Behind the Voice \u2013 Tara Strong as Harley Quinn|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=January 10, 2015}}</ref>\n* Harley Quinn is among the villains summoned by [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]] to retrieve Starites in ''[[Scribblenauts Unmasked]]''.\n* Harley Quinn appears as a playable character in the mobile game, ''Suicide Squad: Special Ops'', based on the film.\n* She appears as a playable character in ''DC Legends'' and ''DC Unchained''.\n* In ''[[Mortal Kombat 11]]'' she is used as DLC costume skin for [[Cassie Cage]] During the Kombat pack DLC released of [[The Terminator (character)|The Terminator]].\n\n===Novels===\nHarley Quinn has her own novel adaptation from comics as part of the DC Comic Novels series.

Fay of the Social Security Administration selected a record from the top of the first stack of 1,000 records and announced that the first Social Security number in history was assigned to John David Sweeney, Jr., of [[New Rochelle, New York]]. However, since the Social Security numbers were not assigned in chronological order, Sweeney did not receive the lowest Social Security number, 001-01-0001. That distinction belongs to Grace D.

A few duplications did occur when prenumbered cards were sent out to regional SSA offices and (originally) Post Offices. \n\nEmployee, patient, student, and [[Credit history|credit]] records are sometimes indexed by Social Security number.\n\nThe [[Military of the United States|U.S. Armed Forces]] has used the Social Security number as an identification number for Army and Air Force personnel since July 1, 1969, the Navy and Marine Corps for their personnel since January 1, 1972, and the Coast Guard for their personnel since October 1, 1974.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov/personnel-records-center/social-security-numbers |publisher=National Archives |access-date=October 19, 2018 |title=Service Numbers and Social Security Numbers|date=2016-08-15 }}</ref> Previously, the United States military used a much more complicated system of [[Service number (United States)|service numbers]] that varied by service.\n\nBeginning in June 2011, DOD began removing the Social Security number from military identification cards.

The most common type contains the cardholder's name and number.  Such cards are issued to U.S. citizens and U.S. permanent residents. There are also two restricted types of Social Security cards:\n* One reads \"not valid for employment.\" Such cards cannot be used as proof of work authorization, and are not acceptable as a List C document on the I-9 form.\n* The other reads \"valid for work only with DHS authorization\", or the older, \"valid for work only with INS authorization.\" These cards are issued to people who have temporary work authorization in the U.S.  They can satisfy the I-9 requirement, if they are accompanied by a work authorization card.\n\nIn 2004 Congress passed The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act; parts of which mandated that the Social Security Administration redesign the Social Security Number (SSN) Card to prevent forgery. From April 2006 through August 2007, [[Social Security Administration]] (SSA) and [[United States Government Publishing Office|Government Printing Office]] (GPO) employees were assigned to redesign the Social Security Number Card to the specifications of the Interagency Task Force created by the Commissioner of Social Security in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security.\n\nThe new SSN card design utilizes both covert and overt security features created by the SSA and GPO design teams.\n\n== Identity theft ==\n[[File:Dog Tag WWII P.jpg|thumb|[[Dog tag]] from [[World War II]] (possibly Army-Air Corps), labeled \"P\" for [[Protestant]].]]\n\nMany citizens and [[privacy]] advocates are concerned about the disclosure and processing of Social Security numbers.  Furthermore, researchers at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] have demonstrated an algorithm that uses publicly available personal information to reconstruct a given SSN.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2009/07/social-insecurity-numbers-open-to-hacking/ |first=John |last=Timmer |publisher=Ars Technica |date=July 17, 2009 |access-date=October 19, 2018 |title=New algorithm guesses SSNs using date and place of birth}}</ref>\n\nThe SSN is frequently used by those involved in [[identity theft]], since it is interconnected with many other forms of identification, and because people asking for it treat it as an [[authentication|authenticator]]. Financial institutions generally require an SSN to set up [[bank account]]s, [[credit card]]s, and loans\u2014partly because they assume that no one except the person it was issued to knows it.\n\nExacerbating the problem of using the Social Security number as an identifier is the fact that the Social Security card contains no [[Biometrics|biometric]] identifiers of any sort, making it essentially impossible to tell whether a person using a certain SSN truly belongs to someone without relying on other documentation (which may itself have been falsely procured through use of the fraudulent SSN). Congress has proposed federal laws that restrict the use of SSNs for identification and bans their use for a number of commercial purposes\u2014e.g., rental applications.<ref>{{cite web |access-date=October 19, 2018 |publisher=News.cnet.com |last=Broache |title=Congress may slap restrictions on SSN use - CNET News |url=http://news.cnet.com/Congress+may+slap+restrictions+on+SSN+use/2100-7348_3-6071441.html?tag=nefd.top |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120711052547/http://news.cnet.com/Congress-may-slap-restrictions-on-SSN-use/2100-7348_3-6071441.html |archive-date=2012-07-11 |first=Anne}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) offers alternatives to SSNs in some places where providing untrusted parties with identification numbers is essential. Tax return preparers must obtain and use a [[Preparer Tax Identification Number]] (PTIN) to include on their client's tax returns (as part of signature requirements). Day care services have tax benefits, and even a sole proprietor should give parents an EIN (employer identification number) to use on their tax return.\n\nThe Social Security Administration has suggested that, if asked to provide his or her Social Security number, a citizen should ask which law requires its use.<ref name=\"howcaniprotect\"/> In accordance with \u00a77213 of the [[9/11 Commission Implementation Act of 2004]] and {{USCFR|20|422|103|(e)(2)}}, the number of replacement Social Security cards per person is generally limited to three per calendar year and ten in a [[life]]time.<ref name=\"howcaniprotect\">{{cite web |url=https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/10002.html |publisher=Social Security Administration |access-date=October 19, 2018 |title=Your Social Security Number And Card, \"How can I protect my Social Security number?\"}}</ref>\n\nIdentity confusion has also occurred because of the use of local Social Security numbers by the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the Republic of Palau, whose numbers overlap with those of residents of New Hampshire and Maine.<ref>{{cite news |access-date=October 19, 2018 |publisher=The Plain Dealer |first=Bill |last=Meyer |title=How many Americans' Social Security numbers were officially duplicated for Pacific islanders? |url=https://www.cleveland.com/nation/index.ssf/2009/08/how_many_americans_social_secu.html |date=August 17, 2009}}</ref>\n\n== Replacement numbers ==\n\nA person can request a new Social Security number, but only under certain conditions;<ref>{{cite web |title=Can I change my Social Security number?|url=https://faq.ssa.gov/en-us/Topic/article/KA-02220 |website=Social Security Administration |access-date=October 19, 2018}}</ref>\n\n* Where sequential numbers assigned to members of the same family are causing problems.\n* In the event of duplicates having been issued.\n*In cases where the person has been a victim of domestic violence or harassment, and there is a clear need to change their number for their personal safety.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10093.pdf |website=Social Security Administration |access-date=October 19, 2018 |title=New Numbers for Domestic Violence Victims }}</ref>\n*When a person has been a victim of identity theft, and their Social Security number continues to be problematic.\n* Where a person has a demonstrable religious objection to a number (such as certain Christians being averse to the number [[Number of the Beast|666]]).\n\nFor all of these conditions, credible third-party evidence such as a restraining order or police report is required.\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe Social Security number is a nine-digit number in the format \"AAA-GG-SSSS\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ssa.gov/history/ssn/geocard.html |access-date=October 19, 2018 |author=Social Security Administration |title=The SSN Numbering Scheme}}</ref> The number is divided into three parts: the first three digits, known as the ''area number'' because they were formerly assigned by geographical region; the middle two digits, known as the ''group number''; and the final four digits, known as the ''serial number.''\n\nOn June 25, 2011, the SSA changed the SSN assignment process to \"SSN randomization\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ssa.gov/employer/randomization.html |publisher=Socialsecurity.gov |access-date=October 19, 2018 |title=Social Security Number Randomization}}</ref> SSN randomization affected the SSN assignment process in the following ways:\n\n# It eliminated the geographical significance of the first three digits of the SSN, referred to as the area number, by no longer allocating specific numbers by state for assignment to individuals.\n# It eliminated the significance of the highest group number assigned for each area number, and, as a result, the High Group List is frozen in time and can be used for validation of only those SSNs issued prior to the randomization implementation date (see section \"Valid SSNs\").\n# Previously unassigned area numbers have been introduced for assignment, excluding area numbers 000, 666 and 900\u2013999.\nBecause [[Individual Taxpayer Identification Number]]s (ITINs) are issued by the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS), they were not affected by this SSA change.\n\n=== Historical structure ===\nPrior to the 2011 randomization process, the first three digits or [[#List of Social Security Area Numbers|area number]] were assigned by geographical region. Prior to 1973, cards were issued in local Social Security offices around the country and the area number represented the office code where the card was issued. This did not necessarily have to be in the area where the applicant lived, since a person could apply for their card in any Social Security office. Beginning in 1973, when the SSA began assigning SSNs and issuing cards centrally from [[Baltimore]], the area number was assigned based on the [[ZIP Code]] in the mailing address provided on the application for the original Social Security card. The applicant's mailing address did not have to be the same as their place of residence. Thus, the area number did not necessarily represent the state of residence of the applicant regardless of whether the card was issued prior to, or after, 1973.\n\nGenerally, numbers were assigned beginning in the [[Northeastern United States|northeast]] and moving south and westward, so that people applying from addresses on the east coast had the lowest numbers and those on the west coast had the highest numbers. As the areas assigned to a locality were exhausted, new areas from the pool were assigned, so some states had noncontiguous groups of numbers.\n\nThe middle two digits or ''group number'' range from 01 to 99. Even before SSN randomization, the group numbers were not assigned consecutively within an area. Instead, for administrative reasons, group numbers were issued in the following order:<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ssa.gov/history/ssn/geocard.html |publisher=SocialSecurity.gov |access-date=October 19, 2018 |title=The SSN Numbering Scheme}}</ref>\n\n#  odd numbers from 01 through 09\n#  even numbers from 10 through 98\n#  even numbers from 02 through 08\n#  odd numbers from 11 through 99\n\nAs an example, group number 98 would be issued before 11.\n\nThe last four digits are ''serial numbers''. Before SSN randomization took effect, they represented a straight numerical sequence of digits from 0001 to 9999 within the group.\n\n===  Valid SSNs  ===\n\nPrior to June 25, 2011, a valid SSN could not have an area number between 734 and 749, or above 772, the highest area number the Social Security Administration had allocated. Effective June 25, 2011, the SSA assigns SSNs randomly and allows for the assignment of area numbers between 734 and 749 and above 772 through the 800s.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ssa.gov/employer/stateweb.htm |publisher=Social Security Administration |access-date=October 19, 2018 |title=Social Security Number Allocations}}</ref>  This should not be confused with Tax Identification Numbers (TINs), which include additional area numbers.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/taxpayer-identification-numbers-tin |title=Taxpayer Identification Numbers (TIN) |publisher=Internal Revenue Service |date=May 2, 2018 |access-date=October 19, 2018}}</ref>\n\nSome special numbers are never allocated:\n*  Numbers with all zeros in any digit group (''000''-##-####, ###-''00''-####, ###-##-''0000'').<ref name=\"FAQInvalid\">{{cite web |url=https://www.ssa.gov/employer/randomization.html |publisher=Social Security Administration |access-date=October 19, 2018 |title=Social Security Number Randomization}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |access-date=October 19, 2018 |publisher=United States Social Security Administration |title=RM 10201.035 Invalid Social Security Numbers (SSNs) |url=https://secure.ssa.gov/apps10/poms.nsf/lnx/0110201035 |work=Program Operations Manual System (POMS) |date=June 23, 2011}}</ref>\n*  Numbers with 666 or 900\u2013999 ([[Individual Taxpayer Identification Number]]) in the first digit group.<ref name=\"FAQInvalid\" />\n\nUntil 2011, the SSA published the last group number used for each area number.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ssa.gov/employer/ssnvhighgroup.htm |publisher=Social Security Administration |access-date=October 19, 2018 |title=High Group List And Other Ways To Determine If An SSN Is Valid}}</ref> Since group numbers were allocated in a regular pattern, it was possible to identify an unissued SSN that contained an invalid group number.

It has issued over 450 million since the start of the program, and at a use rate of about 5.5 million per year.

Ferree Company]] in [[Lockport (city), New York|Lockport, New York]], decided to promote its product by showing how a Social Security card would fit into its [[wallet]]s. A sample card, used for display purposes, was placed in each wallet, which was sold by [[F.W. Woolworth Company|Woolworth]] and other department stores across the country; the wallet manufacturer's vice president and treasurer Douglas Patterson used the actual SSN of his secretary, Hilda Schrader Whitcher.\n\nEven though the card was printed in red (the real card is printed in blue) and had \"Specimen\" printed across the front, many people used Whitcher's SSN as their own. The Social Security Administration's account of the incident also claims that the fake card was half the size of a real card, despite a miniature card's being useless for its purpose and despite  Whitcher's holding two cards of apparently identical size in the accompanying photograph.

On December 1, 1936, as part of the publicity campaign for the new program, Joseph L. Fay of the Social Security Administration selected a record from the top of the first stack of 1,000 records and announced that the first Social Security number in history was assigned to John David Sweeney, Jr., of [[New Rochelle, New York]].

It has since come to be used as an identifier for individuals within the United States, although rare errors occur where duplicates do exist.  As numbers are now assigned by the central issuing office of the SSA, it is unlikely that duplication will ever occur again. A few duplications did occur when prenumbered cards were sent out to regional SSA offices and (originally) Post Offices. \n\nEmployee, patient, student, and [[Credit history|credit]] records are sometimes indexed by Social Security number.\n\nThe [[Military of the United States|U.S. Armed Forces]] has used the Social Security number as an identification number for Army and Air Force personnel since July 1, 1969, the Navy and Marine Corps for their personnel since January 1, 1972, and the Coast Guard for their personnel since October 1, 1974.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov/personnel-records-center/social-security-numbers |publisher=National Archives |access-date=October 19, 2018 |title=Service Numbers and Social Security Numbers|date=2016-08-15 }}</ref> Previously, the United States military used a much more complicated system of [[Service number (United States)|service numbers]] that varied by service.\n\nBeginning in June 2011, DOD began removing the Social Security number from military identification cards.

The most common type contains the cardholder's name and number.  Such cards are issued to U.S. citizens and U.S. permanent residents. There are also two restricted types of Social Security cards:\n* One reads \"not valid for employment.\" Such cards cannot be used as proof of work authorization, and are not acceptable as a List C document on the I-9 form.\n* The other reads \"valid for work only with DHS authorization\", or the older, \"valid for work only with INS authorization.\" These cards are issued to people who have temporary work authorization in the U.S.  They can satisfy the I-9 requirement, if they are accompanied by a work authorization card.\n\nIn 2004 Congress passed The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act; parts of which mandated that the Social Security Administration redesign the Social Security Number (SSN) Card to prevent forgery. From April 2006 through August 2007, [[Social Security Administration]] (SSA) and [[United States Government Publishing Office|Government Printing Office]] (GPO) employees were assigned to redesign the Social Security Number Card to the specifications of the Interagency Task Force created by the Commissioner of Social Security in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security.\n\nThe new SSN card design utilizes both covert and overt security features created by the SSA and GPO design teams.\n\n== Identity theft ==\n[[File:Dog Tag WWII P.jpg|thumb|[[Dog tag]] from [[World War II]] (possibly Army-Air Corps), labeled \"P\" for [[Protestant]].]]\n\nMany citizens and [[privacy]] advocates are concerned about the disclosure and processing of Social Security numbers.  Furthermore, researchers at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] have demonstrated an algorithm that uses publicly available personal information to reconstruct a given SSN.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2009/07/social-insecurity-numbers-open-to-hacking/ |first=John |last=Timmer |publisher=Ars Technica |date=July 17, 2009 |access-date=October 19, 2018 |title=New algorithm guesses SSNs using date and place of birth}}</ref>\n\nThe SSN is frequently used by those involved in [[identity theft]], since it is interconnected with many other forms of identification, and because people asking for it treat it as an [[authentication|authenticator]]. Financial institutions generally require an SSN to set up [[bank account]]s, [[credit card]]s, and loans\u2014partly because they assume that no one except the person it was issued to knows it.\n\nExacerbating the problem of using the Social Security number as an identifier is the fact that the Social Security card contains no [[Biometrics|biometric]] identifiers of any sort, making it essentially impossible to tell whether a person using a certain SSN truly belongs to someone without relying on other documentation (which may itself have been falsely procured through use of the fraudulent SSN). Congress has proposed federal laws that restrict the use of SSNs for identification and bans their use for a number of commercial purposes\u2014e.g., rental applications.<ref>{{cite web |access-date=October 19, 2018 |publisher=News.cnet.com |last=Broache |title=Congress may slap restrictions on SSN use - CNET News |url=http://news.cnet.com/Congress+may+slap+restrictions+on+SSN+use/2100-7348_3-6071441.html?tag=nefd.top |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120711052547/http://news.cnet.com/Congress-may-slap-restrictions-on-SSN-use/2100-7348_3-6071441.html |archive-date=2012-07-11 |first=Anne}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) offers alternatives to SSNs in some places where providing untrusted parties with identification numbers is essential. Tax return preparers must obtain and use a [[Preparer Tax Identification Number]] (PTIN) to include on their client's tax returns (as part of signature requirements). Day care services have tax benefits, and even a sole proprietor should give parents an EIN (employer identification number) to use on their tax return.\n\nThe Social Security Administration has suggested that, if asked to provide his or her Social Security number, a citizen should ask which law requires its use.<ref name=\"howcaniprotect\"/> In accordance with \u00a77213 of the [[9/11 Commission Implementation Act of 2004]] and {{USCFR|20|422|103|(e)(2)}}, the number of replacement Social Security cards per person is generally limited to three per calendar year and ten in a [[life]]time.<ref name=\"howcaniprotect\">{{cite web |url=https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/10002.html |publisher=Social Security Administration |access-date=October 19, 2018 |title=Your Social Security Number And Card, \"How can I protect my Social Security number?\"}}</ref>\n\nIdentity confusion has also occurred because of the use of local Social Security numbers by the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the Republic of Palau, whose numbers overlap with those of residents of New Hampshire and Maine.<ref>{{cite news |access-date=October 19, 2018 |publisher=The Plain Dealer |first=Bill |last=Meyer |title=How many Americans' Social Security numbers were officially duplicated for Pacific islanders? |url=https://www.cleveland.com/nation/index.ssf/2009/08/how_many_americans_social_secu.html |date=August 17, 2009}}</ref>\n\n== Replacement numbers ==\n\nA person can request a new Social Security number, but only under certain conditions;<ref>{{cite web |title=Can I change my Social Security number?|url=https://faq.ssa.gov/en-us/Topic/article/KA-02220 |website=Social Security Administration |access-date=October 19, 2018}}</ref>\n\n* Where sequential numbers assigned to members of the same family are causing problems.\n* In the event of duplicates having been issued.\n*In cases where the person has been a victim of domestic violence or harassment, and there is a clear need to change their number for their personal safety.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10093.pdf |website=Social Security Administration |access-date=October 19, 2018 |title=New Numbers for Domestic Violence Victims }}</ref>\n*When a person has been a victim of identity theft, and their Social Security number continues to be problematic.\n* Where a person has a demonstrable religious objection to a number (such as certain Christians being averse to the number [[Number of the Beast|666]]).\n\nFor all of these conditions, credible third-party evidence such as a restraining order or police report is required.\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe Social Security number is a nine-digit number in the format \"AAA-GG-SSSS\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ssa.gov/history/ssn/geocard.html |access-date=October 19, 2018 |author=Social Security Administration |title=The SSN Numbering Scheme}}</ref> The number is divided into three parts: the first three digits, known as the ''area number'' because they were formerly assigned by geographical region; the middle two digits, known as the ''group number''; and the final four digits, known as the ''serial number.''\n\nOn June 25, 2011, the SSA changed the SSN assignment process to \"SSN randomization\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ssa.gov/employer/randomization.html |publisher=Socialsecurity.gov |access-date=October 19, 2018 |title=Social Security Number Randomization}}</ref> SSN randomization affected the SSN assignment process in the following ways:\n\n# It eliminated the geographical significance of the first three digits of the SSN, referred to as the area number, by no longer allocating specific numbers by state for assignment to individuals.\n# It eliminated the significance of the highest group number assigned for each area number, and, as a result, the High Group List is frozen in time and can be used for validation of only those SSNs issued prior to the randomization implementation date (see section \"Valid SSNs\").\n# Previously unassigned area numbers have been introduced for assignment, excluding area numbers 000, 666 and 900\u2013999.\nBecause [[Individual Taxpayer Identification Number]]s (ITINs) are issued by the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS), they were not affected by this SSA change.\n\n=== Historical structure ===\nPrior to the 2011 randomization process, the first three digits or [[#List of Social Security Area Numbers|area number]] were assigned by geographical region. Prior to 1973, cards were issued in local Social Security offices around the country and the area number represented the office code where the card was issued. This did not necessarily have to be in the area where the applicant lived, since a person could apply for their card in any Social Security office. Beginning in 1973, when the SSA began assigning SSNs and issuing cards centrally from [[Baltimore]], the area number was assigned based on the [[ZIP Code]] in the mailing address provided on the application for the original Social Security card. The applicant's mailing address did not have to be the same as their place of residence. Thus, the area number did not necessarily represent the state of residence of the applicant regardless of whether the card was issued prior to, or after, 1973.\n\nGenerally, numbers were assigned beginning in the [[Northeastern United States|northeast]] and moving south and westward, so that people applying from addresses on the east coast had the lowest numbers and those on the west coast had the highest numbers. As the areas assigned to a locality were exhausted, new areas from the pool were assigned, so some states had noncontiguous groups of numbers.\n\nThe middle two digits or ''group number'' range from 01 to 99. Even before SSN randomization, the group numbers were not assigned consecutively within an area. Instead, for administrative reasons, group numbers were issued in the following order:<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ssa.gov/history/ssn/geocard.html |publisher=SocialSecurity.gov |access-date=October 19, 2018 |title=The SSN Numbering Scheme}}</ref>\n\n#  odd numbers from 01 through 09\n#  even numbers from 10 through 98\n#  even numbers from 02 through 08\n#  odd numbers from 11 through 99\n\nAs an example, group number 98 would be issued before 11.\n\nThe last four digits are ''serial numbers''. Before SSN randomization took effect, they represented a straight numerical sequence of digits from 0001 to 9999 within the group.\n\n===  Valid SSNs  ===\n\nPrior to June 25, 2011, a valid SSN could not have an area number between 734 and 749, or above 772, the highest area number the Social Security Administration had allocated. Effective June 25, 2011, the SSA assigns SSNs randomly and allows for the assignment of area numbers between 734 and 749 and above 772 through the 800s.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ssa.gov/employer/stateweb.htm |publisher=Social Security Administration |access-date=October 19, 2018 |title=Social Security Number Allocations}}</ref>  This should not be confused with Tax Identification Numbers (TINs), which include additional area numbers.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/taxpayer-identification-numbers-tin |title=Taxpayer Identification Numbers (TIN) |publisher=Internal Revenue Service |date=May 2, 2018 |access-date=October 19, 2018}}</ref>\n\nSome special numbers are never allocated:\n*  Numbers with all zeros in any digit group (''000''-##-####, ###-''00''-####, ###-##-''0000'').<ref name=\"FAQInvalid\">{{cite web |url=https://www.ssa.gov/employer/randomization.html |publisher=Social Security Administration |access-date=October 19, 2018 |title=Social Security Number Randomization}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |access-date=October 19, 2018 |publisher=United States Social Security Administration |title=RM 10201.035 Invalid Social Security Numbers (SSNs) |url=https://secure.ssa.gov/apps10/poms.nsf/lnx/0110201035 |work=Program Operations Manual System (POMS) |date=June 23, 2011}}</ref>\n*  Numbers with 666 or 900\u2013999 ([[Individual Taxpayer Identification Number]]) in the first digit group.<ref name=\"FAQInvalid\" />\n\nUntil 2011, the SSA published the last group number used for each area number.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ssa.gov/employer/ssnvhighgroup.htm |publisher=Social Security Administration |access-date=October 19, 2018 |title=High Group List And Other Ways To Determine If An SSN Is Valid}}</ref> Since group numbers were allocated in a regular pattern, it was possible to identify an unissued SSN that contained an invalid group number. Now numbers are assigned randomly, and fraudulent SSNs are not easily detectable with publicly available information. Many online services, however, provide SSN validation.\n\nUnlike many similar numbers, no [[check digit]] is included.\n\n===Exhaustion and re-use===\n\nThe Social Security Administration does not reuse Social Security numbers. It has issued over 450 million since the start of the program, and at a use rate of about 5.5 million per year. It says it has enough to last several generations without reuse or changing the number of digits.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ssa.gov/history/hfaq.html |publisher=United States Social Security Administration |access-date=October 19, 2018 |title=Q20: Are Social Security numbers reused after a person dies?}}</ref> However, there have been instances where multiple individuals have been inadvertently assigned the same Social Security number.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/3004654/government/a-tale-of-two-women-same-birthday-same-social-security-number-same-big-data-mess.html |publisher=PC World |first=Katherine |last=Noyes |date=November 12, 2015 |access-date=October 19, 2018 |title=A tale of two women: same birthday, same Social Security number, same big-data mess}}</ref>\n\n== SSNs used in advertising ==\n[[File:Walletssn2.gif|thumb|The promotional [[Social Security card]] as distributed by the [[F.W. Woolworth Company]]]]\n\nSome SSNs used in advertising have rendered those numbers invalid. One famous instance of this occurred in 1938 when the [[E. H. Ferree Company]] in [[Lockport (city), New York|Lockport, New York]], decided to promote its product by showing how a Social Security card would fit into its [[wallet]]s. A sample card, used for display purposes, was placed in each wallet, which was sold by [[F.W. Woolworth Company|Woolworth]] and other department stores across the country; the wallet manufacturer's vice president and treasurer Douglas Patterson used the actual SSN of his secretary, Hilda Schrader Whitcher.\n\nEven though the card was printed in red (the real card is printed in blue) and had \"Specimen\" printed across the front, many people used Whitcher's SSN as their own. The Social Security Administration's account of the incident also claims that the fake card was half the size of a real card, despite a miniature card's being useless for its purpose and despite  Whitcher's holding two cards of apparently identical size in the accompanying photograph. Over time, the number that appeared (078-05-1120) has been claimed by a total of over 40,000 people as their own.<ref name=\"Misused\">{{cite web |url=https://www.ssa.gov/history/ssn/misused.html |title=Social Security Cards Issued by Woolworth |publisher=Social Security Administration |access-date=October 19, 2018}}</ref> The SSA initiated an advertising campaign stating that it was incorrect to use the number (Hilda Whitcher was issued a new SSN). However, the number was found to be in use by 12 individuals as late as 1977.<ref name=\"Misused\" />\n\nMore recently, [[Todd Davis]] distributed his SSN in advertisements for his company's [[LifeLock]] identity theft protection service, which allowed his identity to be stolen over a dozen times.<ref name=\"13times\">{{cite web |access-date=October 19, 2018 |last=Zetter |title=LifeLock CEO's Identity Stolen 13 Times |url=https://www.wired.com/2010/05/lifelock-identity-theft/ |work=Wired |date=May 18, 2010 |first=Kim}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |access-date=October 19, 2018 |work=ComputerWorld |date=May 19, 2010 |first=Jaikumar |last=Vijayan |title=LifeLock CEO said to be victim of identity theft 13 times |url=https://www.computerworld.com/article/2517761/data-privacy/lifelock-ceo-said-to-be-victim-of-identity-theft-13-times.html}}</ref>\n\n==List of Social Security Area Numbers==\nList showing the geographical location of the first three digits of the social security numbers assigned in the [[United States]] and its territories from 1973 until June 25, 2011.

This created a need for more systematic architectural education, and the absence of such opportunities caused many aspiring Canadian architects to study in the United States, where ten architecture schools had already been established.<ref name=History /> Canada did not yet have any formal architectural education, and the only forms of architectural education in Montreal were periodical lectures by local practising architects at McGill's affiliated religious colleges. This new need for architectural education is an important factor that led to the founding of the School of Architecture at McGill University.<ref name=Beginning>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/architecture/school/history/beginning|title=The beginning with Stewart H.

Macdonald]] created a chair in architecture at McGill which was led by [[Stewart Henbest Capper]]. At this time, the School offered a four-year course to prepare students for professional accreditation. The first graduating class was composed of three students: George Taylor Hyde, Norman M. McLeod and Frank Peder. Professor Capper gave all lectures in architecture, and Henry F. Armstrong, the only other full-time professor, taught art classes and modelling.<ref name=Beginning />\n\nThe second director of the School, [[Percy Nobbs]], arrived at McGill in 1903 to only two students: Gordon H. Blackader and H.&nbsp;E. Shorey. He divided the four-year course into two streams, the B.Arch. degree and the B.Sc. degree in Architectural Engineering. Three new staff were hired in 1906, and three years later, [[Philip J.

In 1945, a new five-year program was adopted for the next two decades. After the [[World War Two|war]], the School of Architecture increased its staff and doubled its physical accommodation due to the surge in university enrollment. This required the School to briefly use McGill's [[Dawson College]], a [[satellite campus]] in St. Jean, Quebec, to accommodate its students. By 1947, the School had become so cramped that a former Victorian residential building on University Street was vacated to make room for the School's students.<ref name=McGillForties />\n\nAround this time, Professor Frederic Lasserre of McGill's School of Architecture left the university to establish a new School of Architecture at the [[University of British Columbia]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sala.ubc.ca/about/history|title=History|publisher=University of British Columbia School of Architecture + Landscape Architecture|accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref> and invited McGill Architecture graduates [[Catherine Mary Wisnicki]], [[Peter Oberlander]] and [[Arthur Erickson]] to teach at his new school.<ref name=McGillForties />\n\nIn 1946, [[Harold Spence-Sales]] was appointed Associate Professor of Design.

This created a need for more systematic architectural education, and the absence of such opportunities caused many aspiring Canadian architects to study in the United States, where ten architecture schools had already been established.<ref name=History /> Canada did not yet have any formal architectural education, and the only forms of architectural education in Montreal were periodical lectures by local practising architects at McGill's affiliated religious colleges. This new need for architectural education is an important factor that led to the founding of the School of Architecture at McGill University.<ref name=Beginning>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/architecture/school/history/beginning|title=The beginning with Stewart H.

Macdonald]] created a chair in architecture at McGill which was led by [[Stewart Henbest Capper]]. At this time, the School offered a four-year course to prepare students for professional accreditation. The first graduating class was composed of three students: George Taylor Hyde, Norman M. McLeod and Frank Peder. Professor Capper gave all lectures in architecture, and Henry F. Armstrong, the only other full-time professor, taught art classes and modelling.<ref name=Beginning />\n\nThe second director of the School, [[Percy Nobbs]], arrived at McGill in 1903 to only two students: Gordon H. Blackader and H.&nbsp;E. Shorey. He divided the four-year course into two streams, the B.Arch. degree and the B.Sc. degree in Architectural Engineering.

After the [[World War Two|war]], the School of Architecture increased its staff and doubled its physical accommodation due to the surge in university enrollment. This required the School to briefly use McGill's [[Dawson College]], a [[satellite campus]] in St. Jean, Quebec, to accommodate its students. By 1947, the School had become so cramped that a former Victorian residential building on University Street was vacated to make room for the School's students.<ref name=McGillForties />\n\nAround this time, Professor Frederic Lasserre of McGill's School of Architecture left the university to establish a new School of Architecture at the [[University of British Columbia]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sala.ubc.ca/about/history|title=History|publisher=University of British Columbia School of Architecture + Landscape Architecture|accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref> and invited McGill Architecture graduates [[Catherine Mary Wisnicki]], [[Peter Oberlander]] and [[Arthur Erickson]] to teach at his new school.<ref name=McGillForties />\n\nIn 1946, [[Harold Spence-Sales]] was appointed Associate Professor of Design.
