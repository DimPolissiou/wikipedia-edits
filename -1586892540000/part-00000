Following the breakup of the circle, Parker traveled to Hollywood to pursue [[screenwriting]]. Her successes there, including two [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, were curtailed when her involvement in [[left-wing politics]] resulted in her being placed on the [[Hollywood blacklist]].\n\nDismissive of her own talents, she deplored her reputation as a \"wisecracker\".

The Round Table numbered among its members the newspaper columnists [[Franklin Pierce Adams]] and [[Alexander Woollcott]]. Through their publication of Parker's lunchtime remarks and short verses, particularly in Adams' column \"The Conning Tower\", Dorothy began developing a national reputation as a wit.

Parker's first piece for the magazine was published in its second issue.<ref>Silverstein 32</ref> Parker became famous for her short, viciously humorous poems, many highlighting ludicrous aspects of her many (largely unsuccessful) romantic affairs and others wistfully considering the appeal of suicide.\n\nThe next 15 years were Parker's greatest period of productivity and success. In the 1920s alone she published some 300 poems and free verses in ''Vanity Fair,'' ''Vogue,'' \"The Conning Tower\" and ''The New Yorker'' as well as ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'', ''[[McCall's]]'' and ''[[The New Republic]].''<ref>Silverstein 62\u20133</ref>  Her poem, \"Song in a Minor Key\" was published during a candid interview with New York [[Newspaper Enterprise Association|N.E.A.]] writer, [[Josephine Van de Grift]]. <ref> Van de Grift, Josephine.

''Not So Deep as a Well'' (1936) collected much of the material previously published in ''Rope,'' ''Gun,'' and ''Death'' and she re-released her fiction with a few new pieces in 1939 under the title ''Here Lies.''\n\nShe collaborated with playwright [[Elmer Rice]] to create ''Close Harmony,'' which ran on Broadway in December 1924.
