[[Australia\u2013United States relations|U.S.\u2013Australian relations]] have been close throughout the [[history of Australia]]. Before [[World War II]], [[Australia]] was closely aligned with the [[United Kingdom]], but it has strengthened its relationship with the [[United States]] since 1942, as Britain's influence in Asia has declined and the United States' influence has increased. At the governmental level, United States\u2013Australia relationships are formalised by the [[ANZUS]] treaty and [[Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement]].\n\nThe [[Embassy of the United States, Canberra|embassy]] in [[Canberra]] has always been regarded as a desirable posting and hence has become a patronage position. U.S. Ambassadors to Australia have traditionally been friends, political allies, or former business associates of the President of the day. Some have been major donors to the President's election campaign or political party. Few have been career diplomats ([[Marshall Green]] was a conspicuous exception). The two ambassadors during the [[George W. Bush|Bush]] Administration, for example, were [[Tom Schieffer]], a former business associate of President Bush, and [[Robert McCallum Jr.]], a Bush college friend. The actor [[Fess Parker]] was offered the post in 1985 by [[Ronald Reagan]], after representing Reagan at an event in Australia. Parker considered it, but turned it down.<ref>[http://www.legacy.com/ns/obituary.aspx?pid=140851424 Legacy.com, Fess Parker obituary]</ref>\n\nThis arrangement has suited Australian governments, which welcome the ability of such Ambassadors to gain direct access to the President, bypassing the State Department. The United States was without an ambassador to Australia from September 2016 until February 2019.\n\n==United States Ambassadors to Australia==\nThe following individuals have served as the US Ambassadors to Australia, or any precedent titles:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable collapsible\"\n|+ List of US Ambassadors to Australia\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Ordinal\n! scope=\"col\" | Officeholder\n! scope=\"col\" | Image\n! scope=\"col\" | Term began\n! scope=\"col\" | Term ended\n! scope=\"col\" | Time in office\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Notes\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"; colspan=7 | US Ministers to Australia\n|-\n|align=center| {{nts|1}} || {{sort|Gauss, Clarence E.|[[Clarence E.

The ages for professionals are up to 45 for men and 35 for women for three years service as commissioned and non-commissioned officers.\n \nAn official publication has revealed that almost one-quarter of Myanmar's new national budget will be allocated to defence.

Cracks appeared along the lines of ethnic background, political affiliation, organisational origin and different services. Its unity and operational efficiency was further weakened by the interference of civilians and politicians in military affairs, and the perception gap between the staff officers and field commanders. The most serious problem was the tension between ethnic [[Karen people|Karen]] Officers, coming from the British Burma Army and [[Bamar]] officers, coming from the [[Patriotic Burmese Forces]] (PBF).<ref name=\"DSHMRI Archives\">Defence Services Historical Museum and Research Institute (DSHMRI) Archives</ref>\n \nIn accordance with agreement reached at Kandy Conference in September 1945, the Tatmadaw was reorganised by incorporating the [[British Burma Army]] and the Patriotic Burmese Forces. The officer corps shared by ex-PBF officers and officers from British Burma Army and Army of Burma Reserve Organisation (ARBO). The British also decided to form what were known as \"Class Battalions\" based on ethnicity. There were a total of 15 rifle battalions at the time of independence and four of them were made up of former members of PBF.  All influential positions within the War Office and commands were manned with non-former PBF Officers. All services including military engineers, supply and transport, ordnance and medical services, Navy and Air Force were all commanded by former Officers from ABRO and British Burma Army.<ref name=\"DSHMRI Archives\"/>\n \n \n \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+ Ethnic and Army Composition of Tatmadaw in 1948\n|-\n!

There were 337 [[infantry battalion]]s, including 266 [[light infantry]] battalions. Although the Myanmar Army's organisational structure was based upon the [[Regiment|regimental system]], the basic manoeuvre and fighting unit is the [[battalion]], known as ''Tat Yinn'' ({{my|(\u1010\u1015\u103a\u101b\u1004\u103a\u1038)}}) in Burmese.  This comprised a headquarters unit; five rifle companies ''Tat Khwe'' ({{my|(\u1010\u1015\u103a\u1001\u103d\u1032)}}) with three rifle platoons ''Tat Su'' ({{my|(\u1010\u1015\u103a\u1005\u102f)}}) each; an administration company with medical, transport, logistics and signals units; a heavy weapons company including [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]], machine gun and [[recoilless gun]] platoons.  Each [[battalion]] is commanded by a Lieutenant Colonel ''Du Ti Ya Bo Hmu Gyi or Du Bo Hmu Gyi'' with a Major (''bo hmu'') as 2IC (Second in Command), with a total establishment strength of 27 officers and 723 other ranks. Light infantry battalions in the Myanmar Army have much lower establishment strength of around 500; this often leads to these units being mistakenly identified by the observers and reporters as under strength infantry battalions.\n \nWith its significantly increased personnel numbers, weaponry and mobility, today's ''Tatmadaw Kyee'' ({{my|\u1010\u1015\u103a\u1019\u1010\u1031\u102c\u103a(\u1000\u103c\u100a\u103a\u1038)}}) is a formidable conventional defence force for the Union of Myanmar.  Troops ready for combat duty have at least doubled since 1988.  Logistics infrastructure and [[Artillery]] Fire Support has been greatly increased.  Its newly acquired military might was apparent in the Tatmadaw's dry season operations against [[Karen National Union]] (KNU) strongholds in [[Manerplaw]] and Kawmura.  Most of the casualties at these battles were the result of intense and heavy bombardment by the Tatmadaw Kyee.  The Tatmadaw Kyee is now much larger than it was before 1988, it is more mobile and has greatly improved armour, artillery and air defence inventories.  Its C3I (Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence) systems have been expanded and refined.  It is developing larger and more integrated, self-sustained formations to better coordinated action by different combat arms. The army may still have relatively modest weaponry compared to its larger neighbours, but it is now in a much better position to deter external aggression and respond to such a threat should it ever arise, although [[child soldiers]] may not perform very well in combating with enemies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/HJ07Ae01.html |title=Myanmar's losing military strategy |date=7 October 2006 |work=[[Asia Times]] |accessdate=28 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513043428/http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/HJ07Ae01.html# |archive-date=13 May 2011 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n \n===Expansion===\nThe first army [[division (military)|division]] to be formed after the 1988 military [[coup d'etat|coup]] was the 11th Light Infantry Division (LID) in December 1988 with [[Colonel]] Win Myint as commander of the division.  In March 1990, a new regional military command was opened in [[Monywa]] with [[Brigadier]] Kyaw Min as commander and named North-Western Regional Military Command.  A year later 101st LID was formed in [[Pakokku]] with Colonel Saw Tun as commander.  Two Regional Operations Commands (ROC) were formed in [[Myeik, Burma|Myeik]] and [[Loikaw]] to facilitate command and control.  They were commanded respectively by Brigadier Soe Tint and Brigadier Maung Kyi.  March 1995 saw a dramatic expansion of the Tatmadaw as it established 11 Military Operations Commands (MOC)s in that month.  MOC are similar to [[Mechanised Infantry]] Divisions in western armies, each with 10 regular infantry battalions (''Chay Hlyin Tatyin''), a headquarters, and organic support units including [[field artillery]] batteries.  Then in 1996, two new RMC were opened, Coastal Region RMC was opened in Myeik with Brigadier Sit Maung as commander and Triangle Region RMC in [[Kengtung]] with Brigadier [[Thein Sein]] as commander.  Three new ROCs were opened in [[Kalay]], [[Bhamo]] and [[Mongsat]].  In late 1998, two new MOCs were opened in Bokepyin and Mongsat.<ref>WP 342. [[Australian National University]]</ref>\n \nThe most significant expansion after the infantry in the army was in armour and artillery. Beginning in 1990, the Tatmadaw procured 18 [[Type 59 tank|T-69II]] [[Main battle tank]]s and 48 [[PT-76|T-63]] amphibious [[light tank]]s from China.  Further procurements were made, including several hundred [[Type 85 AFV|Type 85]] and [[WZ551|Type 92]] [[Armoured personnel carrier]]s (APC).  By the beginning of 1998, Tatmadaw had about 100+ T-69II Main battle tanks, a similar number of T-63 amphibious light tanks and several T-59D tanks.  These tanks and armoured personnel carriers were distributed into five armoured infantry battalions and five tank battalions and formed the first Armoured Division of the Tatmadaw under the name of 71st Armoured Operations Command with its headquarters in Pyawbwe.\n \n===Bureau of Special Operations (BSO)===\n[[File:MM MOD New.svg|thumb|Bureau of Special Operations|150px]]\n[[File:mm-rmc-map.jpg|thumb|Regional Military Commands (RMC)|200px]]\nBureau of Special Operations ({{my|\u1000\u102c\u1000\u103d\u101a\u103a\u101b\u1031\u1038\u100c\u102c\u1014 \u1005\u1005\u103a\u1006\u1004\u103a\u101b\u1031\u1038 \u1021\u1011\u1030\u1038\u1021\u1016\u103d\u1032\u1037}}) in Myanmar Army are high-level field units equivalent to [[Field Army]] in Western terms and consist of 2 or more Regional Military Commands (RMC) and commanded by a lieutenant-general and 6 staff officers.\n \nThe units were introduced under the [[General Staff|General Staff Office]] on 28 April 1978 and 1 June 1979. In early 1978, the then Chairman of BSPP General Ne Win visited the North Eastern Command Headquarters in Lashio to receive a briefing about [[Burmese Communist Party]] (BCP) [[insurgents]] and their [[military operations]].  He was accompanied by Brigadier General Tun Ye from Ministry of Defence. Brigadier General Tun Ye was the regional commander of Eastern Command for three years and before that he served in North Eastern Command areas as commander of Strategic Operation Command (SOC) and commander for Light Infantry Division for four years.  As BCP military operations were spread across three Regional Military Command (RMC) areas (Northern, Eastern and North Eastern), Brigadier General Tun Ye was the most informed commander about the BCP in Myanmar Army at the time.  At the briefing, General Ne Win was impressed by Brigadier General Tun Ye and realised that co-ordination among various Regional Military Commands (RMC) was necessary; thus, decided to form a bureau at the Ministry of Defence.\n \nOriginally, the bureau was for \"special operations\", wherever they were, that needed co-ordination among various Regional Military Commands (RMC).  Later, with introduction of another bureau, there was a division of command areas.  The BSO-1 was to oversee the operations under the Northern Command, North Eastern Command, the Eastern Command, and the North Western Command.  BSO-2 was to oversee operations under the South Eastern Command, South Western Command, Western Command and Central Command.\n \nInitially, the chief of the BSO had the rank of brigadier general.  The rank was upgraded to major general on 23 April 1979.  in 1990, it was further upgraded to lieutenant general.  Between 1995 and 2002, Chief of Staff (Army) jointly held the position of Chief of BSO.  However, in early 2002, two more BSO were added to the General Staff Office; therefore there were altogether four BSOs.  The fifth BSO was established in 2005 and the sixth in 2007.\n \nCurrently there are Six Bureaus of Special Operations in Myanmar order of Battle.<ref name=\"DSHMRI\">Defence Services Historical Museum and Research Institute</ref>\n \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It was renamed Bureau of Air Defence in the early 2000s (decade). In early 2000, Tatmadaw established Myanmar Integrated Air Defence System (MIADS) with help from Russia, [[Ukraine]] and China. It is a tri-service bureau with units from all three branches of Myanmar Armed Forces. All Air Defence assets except [[Anti-Aircraft Artillery]] within Tatmadaw arsenal are integrated into MIADS. AAA guns are mostly unguided and deploy to use in barrage-style firing against attacking aircraft. MIADS is directly answerable to Bureau of Air Defence under Ministry of Defence.<ref name=\"DSHMRI\"/>\n \nIn 2010, Myanmar Air Defence Command has completed installation of optical fibre communication network throughout the country. Those network are to be used for Air defence operations between Central Command HQ from capital & several air bases, early warning radar stations & mobile anti air craft missile & artillery units.

Each SOC transmitted data back to Intercept Operations Centers (IOC), which in turn controlled [[surface-to-air missile]] batteries and [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]]/[[Interceptor aircraft|interceptor]] squadrons at various Air Bases. Each IOC was optimised to direct either SAMs or fighter/interceptor aircraft against incoming enemy aircraft or missile. Each IOC was connected to observer and early warning area reporting posts (RP) via military owned underground fibre optic cable network. There were about 100 [[radar|radar stations]] located at approximately 40 sites throughout the country. New Air Defence radars such as 1L117 radars, Galaxy Early Warning Radar and P series radars are installed in all radar stations.<ref name=\"DSHMRI\"/>\n \nEach Sector Operation Center (SOC) is commanded by a major general and it consists of one air defence division from Myanmar Army and one fighter-interceptor wing from [[Myanmar Air Force]]. Sometimes Air Defence [[Frigate]]s from Myanmar Navy also operate under the direct command of respective SOC.\n \nEach Air Defence division is commanded by a brigadier general and consists of three Air Defence Tactical Operations Command (TOC) and support units. One Medium Range Surface to Air Missile Tactical Operations Command (MRSAM-TOC), with three battalions equipped with [[Buk missile system|Buk M-1]] or [[2K12 Kub|Kub]] missile system is deployed in an Area Defence Belt role. One Short Range Air Defence Tactical Operations Command (SHORAD-TOC), with three battalions equipped with [[Tor M-1]] missile system is deployed in a Point Defence role for critical areas such as radar stations, fighter bases and SOC headquarters. One Electronic Reconnaissance Tactical Operations Command (EIR-TOC) with 6 to 8 radar and communication companies for early warnings and interdiction detection.\n \nEach fighter-interceptor wing commanded by a [[brigadier general]] and is composed of three Fighter squadrons of either [[MiG-29]] and [[Chengdu J-7|F-7M Airguardi]]Interceptors (ten aircraft per squadron) and their ground base support units.<ref name=\"DSHMRI\"/>\n \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

BSTS based in Pyain Oo Lwin was formed with Operating Cipher Training Troop, Dispacth Rider Training Troop, Lineman Training Troop, Radio Mechanic Training Troop and Regimental Signals Training Troop.  BSS, based in Mingalardon, had nince sections: Administration Troop, Maintenance Troop, Operating Troop, Cipher Troop, Lineman and Dispatch Rider Troop, NBSD Signals Troop, SBSD Signals Troop, Mobile Brigade Signals Toop and Arakan Signals Toop.  The then Chief of Signal Staff Officer (CSO) was Lieutenant Colonel Saw Aung Din.  BSTS and BSS were later renamed No. 1 Signal Battalion and No.1 Signal Training Battalion.  In 1952, the Infantry Divisional Signals Regiment was formed and later renamed to No. 2 Signal Battalion.  HQ Burma Signals was reorganised and became Directorate Signal and the director was elevated to the rank of Colonel.  In 1956, No. 1 Signal Security Battalion was formed, followed by No. 3 Signal Battalion in November 1958 and No.4 Signal Battalion in October 1959.\n \nIn 1961, signal battalions were reorganised as No. 11 Signal Battalion under North Eastern Regional Military Command, No. 121 Signal Battalion under Eastern Command, No. 313 Signal Battalion under Central Command, No.414 Signal Battalion under South Western Command, and No. 515 Signal Battalion under South Eastern Command.  No.1 Signal Training Battalion was renamed Burma Signal Training Depot (Baho-Setthweye-Tat).\n \nBy 1988, Directorate of Signals command one training depot, eight signal battalions, one signal security battalion, one signal store depot and two signal workshops.  Signal Corps under Directorate of Signal further expanded during 1990 expansion and reorganisation of Myanmar Armed Forces.  By 2000, a signal battalion is attached to each Regional Military Command and signal companies are now attached to Light Infantry Divisions and Military Operations Commands.\n \nIn 2000, [[C4ISTAR|Command, Control and Communication]] system of Myanmar Army has been substantially upgraded by setting up the military [[fibre optic]] communication network managed by Directorate of Signal throughout the country. Since 2002 all Myanmar Army Regional Military Command HQs used its own telecommunication system. [[Satellite communication|Satellite communication links]] are also provided to forward-deployed infantry battalions. However, battle field communication systems are still poor. Infantry units are still using TRA 906 and PRM 4051 which were acquired from UK in the 1980s. Myanmar Army also uses the locally built TRA 906 Thura and Chinese XD-D6M radio sets.

The highest rank in the Myanmar Army is Senior General, equivalent to [[Field Marshal]] position in Western Armies and is currently held by Min Aung Hlaing after being promoted from Vice-Senior General.\n \nIn 2011, following transition from military junta government to civilian parliamentary government, the Myanmar Army enacted a military draft for all citizens; all males from the age 18 to 35 and all females age between 18 and 27 years of age can be drafted into military service for two years as enlisted personnel in time of national emergency. The ages for professionals are up to 45 for men and 35 for women for three years service as commissioned and non-commissioned officers.\n \nAn official publication has revealed that almost one-quarter of Myanmar's new national budget will be allocated to defence. The Government Gazette reports that 1.8&nbsp;trillion kyat (about $2&nbsp;billion at free market rates of exchange), or 23.6 percent of the 2011 budget will go to defence.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9LMDOSO1.htm|title=Myanmar allocates 1/4 of new budget to military|date=1 March 2011|agency=[[Associated Press]]|access-date=9 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628213807/http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9LMDOSO1.htm#|archive-date=28 June 2011|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n \n==Brief history==\n \n=== Post Independence era ===\n[[File:Myanmar Army personnel at Naypyidaw reception.jpg|thumb|Myanmar Army Honour Guards saluting the arrival of Thai delegation in October 2010.]]\n \nAt the time of Myanmar's independence in 1948, the Tatmadaw was weak, small and disunited. Cracks appeared along the lines of ethnic background, political affiliation, organisational origin and different services. Its unity and operational efficiency was further weakened by the interference of civilians and politicians in military affairs, and the perception gap between the staff officers and field commanders. The most serious problem was the tension between ethnic [[Karen people|Karen]] Officers, coming from the British Burma Army and [[Bamar]] officers, coming from the [[Patriotic Burmese Forces]] (PBF).<ref name=\"DSHMRI Archives\">Defence Services Historical Museum and Research Institute (DSHMRI) Archives</ref>\n \nIn accordance with agreement reached at Kandy Conference in September 1945, the Tatmadaw was reorganised by incorporating the [[British Burma Army]] and the Patriotic Burmese Forces. The officer corps shared by ex-PBF officers and officers from British Burma Army and Army of Burma Reserve Organisation (ARBO). The British also decided to form what were known as \"Class Battalions\" based on ethnicity. There were a total of 15 rifle battalions at the time of independence and four of them were made up of former members of PBF.  All influential positions within the War Office and commands were manned with non-former PBF Officers. All services including military engineers, supply and transport, ordnance and medical services, Navy and Air Force were all commanded by former Officers from ABRO and British Burma Army.<ref name=\"DSHMRI Archives\"/>\n \n \n \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+ Ethnic and Army Composition of Tatmadaw in 1948\n|-\n!

There were 337 [[infantry battalion]]s, including 266 [[light infantry]] battalions. Although the Myanmar Army's organisational structure was based upon the [[Regiment|regimental system]], the basic manoeuvre and fighting unit is the [[battalion]], known as ''Tat Yinn'' ({{my|(\u1010\u1015\u103a\u101b\u1004\u103a\u1038)}}) in Burmese.  This comprised a headquarters unit; five rifle companies ''Tat Khwe'' ({{my|(\u1010\u1015\u103a\u1001\u103d\u1032)}}) with three rifle platoons ''Tat Su'' ({{my|(\u1010\u1015\u103a\u1005\u102f)}}) each; an administration company with medical, transport, logistics and signals units; a heavy weapons company including [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]], machine gun and [[recoilless gun]] platoons.  Each [[battalion]] is commanded by a Lieutenant Colonel ''Du Ti Ya Bo Hmu Gyi or Du Bo Hmu Gyi'' with a Major (''bo hmu'') as 2IC (Second in Command), with a total establishment strength of 27 officers and 723 other ranks. Light infantry battalions in the Myanmar Army have much lower establishment strength of around 500; this often leads to these units being mistakenly identified by the observers and reporters as under strength infantry battalions.\n \nWith its significantly increased personnel numbers, weaponry and mobility, today's ''Tatmadaw Kyee'' ({{my|\u1010\u1015\u103a\u1019\u1010\u1031\u102c\u103a(\u1000\u103c\u100a\u103a\u1038)}}) is a formidable conventional defence force for the Union of Myanmar.  Troops ready for combat duty have at least doubled since 1988.  Logistics infrastructure and [[Artillery]] Fire Support has been greatly increased.  Its newly acquired military might was apparent in the Tatmadaw's dry season operations against [[Karen National Union]] (KNU) strongholds in [[Manerplaw]] and Kawmura.  Most of the casualties at these battles were the result of intense and heavy bombardment by the Tatmadaw Kyee.  The Tatmadaw Kyee is now much larger than it was before 1988, it is more mobile and has greatly improved armour, artillery and air defence inventories.  Its C3I (Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence) systems have been expanded and refined.  It is developing larger and more integrated, self-sustained formations to better coordinated action by different combat arms. The army may still have relatively modest weaponry compared to its larger neighbours, but it is now in a much better position to deter external aggression and respond to such a threat should it ever arise, although [[child soldiers]] may not perform very well in combating with enemies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/HJ07Ae01.html |title=Myanmar's losing military strategy |date=7 October 2006 |work=[[Asia Times]] |accessdate=28 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513043428/http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/HJ07Ae01.html# |archive-date=13 May 2011 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n \n===Expansion===\nThe first army [[division (military)|division]] to be formed after the 1988 military [[coup d'etat|coup]] was the 11th Light Infantry Division (LID) in December 1988 with [[Colonel]] Win Myint as commander of the division.  In March 1990, a new regional military command was opened in [[Monywa]] with [[Brigadier]] Kyaw Min as commander and named North-Western Regional Military Command.  A year later 101st LID was formed in [[Pakokku]] with Colonel Saw Tun as commander.  Two Regional Operations Commands (ROC) were formed in [[Myeik, Burma|Myeik]] and [[Loikaw]] to facilitate command and control.  They were commanded respectively by Brigadier Soe Tint and Brigadier Maung Kyi.  March 1995 saw a dramatic expansion of the Tatmadaw as it established 11 Military Operations Commands (MOC)s in that month.  MOC are similar to [[Mechanised Infantry]] Divisions in western armies, each with 10 regular infantry battalions (''Chay Hlyin Tatyin''), a headquarters, and organic support units including [[field artillery]] batteries.  Then in 1996, two new RMC were opened, Coastal Region RMC was opened in Myeik with Brigadier Sit Maung as commander and Triangle Region RMC in [[Kengtung]] with Brigadier [[Thein Sein]] as commander.  Three new ROCs were opened in [[Kalay]], [[Bhamo]] and [[Mongsat]].  In late 1998, two new MOCs were opened in Bokepyin and Mongsat.<ref>WP 342. [[Australian National University]]</ref>\n \nThe most significant expansion after the infantry in the army was in armour and artillery. Beginning in 1990, the Tatmadaw procured 18 [[Type 59 tank|T-69II]] [[Main battle tank]]s and 48 [[PT-76|T-63]] amphibious [[light tank]]s from China.  Further procurements were made, including several hundred [[Type 85 AFV|Type 85]] and [[WZ551|Type 92]] [[Armoured personnel carrier]]s (APC).  By the beginning of 1998, Tatmadaw had about 100+ T-69II Main battle tanks, a similar number of T-63 amphibious light tanks and several T-59D tanks.  These tanks and armoured personnel carriers were distributed into five armoured infantry battalions and five tank battalions and formed the first Armoured Division of the Tatmadaw under the name of 71st Armoured Operations Command with its headquarters in Pyawbwe.\n \n===Bureau of Special Operations (BSO)===\n[[File:MM MOD New.svg|thumb|Bureau of Special Operations|150px]]\n[[File:mm-rmc-map.jpg|thumb|Regional Military Commands (RMC)|200px]]\nBureau of Special Operations ({{my|\u1000\u102c\u1000\u103d\u101a\u103a\u101b\u1031\u1038\u100c\u102c\u1014 \u1005\u1005\u103a\u1006\u1004\u103a\u101b\u1031\u1038 \u1021\u1011\u1030\u1038\u1021\u1016\u103d\u1032\u1037}}) in Myanmar Army are high-level field units equivalent to [[Field Army]] in Western terms and consist of 2 or more Regional Military Commands (RMC) and commanded by a lieutenant-general and 6 staff officers.\n \nThe units were introduced under the [[General Staff|General Staff Office]] on 28 April 1978 and 1 June 1979. In early 1978, the then Chairman of BSPP General Ne Win visited the North Eastern Command Headquarters in Lashio to receive a briefing about [[Burmese Communist Party]] (BCP) [[insurgents]] and their [[military operations]].  He was accompanied by Brigadier General Tun Ye from Ministry of Defence. Brigadier General Tun Ye was the regional commander of Eastern Command for three years and before that he served in North Eastern Command areas as commander of Strategic Operation Command (SOC) and commander for Light Infantry Division for four years.  As BCP military operations were spread across three Regional Military Command (RMC) areas (Northern, Eastern and North Eastern), Brigadier General Tun Ye was the most informed commander about the BCP in Myanmar Army at the time.  At the briefing, General Ne Win was impressed by Brigadier General Tun Ye and realised that co-ordination among various Regional Military Commands (RMC) was necessary; thus, decided to form a bureau at the Ministry of Defence.\n \nOriginally, the bureau was for \"special operations\", wherever they were, that needed co-ordination among various Regional Military Commands (RMC).  Later, with introduction of another bureau, there was a division of command areas.  The BSO-1 was to oversee the operations under the Northern Command, North Eastern Command, the Eastern Command, and the North Western Command.  BSO-2 was to oversee operations under the South Eastern Command, South Western Command, Western Command and Central Command.\n \nInitially, the chief of the BSO had the rank of brigadier general.  The rank was upgraded to major general on 23 April 1979.  in 1990, it was further upgraded to lieutenant general.  Between 1995 and 2002, Chief of Staff (Army) jointly held the position of Chief of BSO.  However, in early 2002, two more BSO were added to the General Staff Office; therefore there were altogether four BSOs.  The fifth BSO was established in 2005 and the sixth in 2007.\n \nCurrently there are Six Bureaus of Special Operations in Myanmar order of Battle.<ref name=\"DSHMRI\">Defence Services Historical Museum and Research Institute</ref>\n \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Until 1961, there were only two regional commands, they were supported by 13 Infantry brigades and an infantry division. In October 1961, new regional military commands were opened and leaving only two independent infantry brigades. In June 1963, the Naypyidaw Command was temporarily formed in [[Yangon]] with the deputy commander and some staff officers drawn from Central Command.  It was reorganised and renamed as Yangon Command on 1 June 1965.<ref name=\"DSHMRI\"/>\n \nA total of 337 infantry and light infantry battalions organised in Tactical Operations Commands, 37 independent field artillery regiments supported by affiliated support units including armoured [[reconnaissance]] and [[tank]] battalions.

It was renamed Bureau of Air Defence in the early 2000s (decade). In early 2000, Tatmadaw established Myanmar Integrated Air Defence System (MIADS) with help from Russia, [[Ukraine]] and China. It is a tri-service bureau with units from all three branches of Myanmar Armed Forces. All Air Defence assets except [[Anti-Aircraft Artillery]] within Tatmadaw arsenal are integrated into MIADS. AAA guns are mostly unguided and deploy to use in barrage-style firing against attacking aircraft. MIADS is directly answerable to Bureau of Air Defence under Ministry of Defence.<ref name=\"DSHMRI\"/>\n \nIn 2010, Myanmar Air Defence Command has completed installation of optical fibre communication network throughout the country. Those network are to be used for Air defence operations between Central Command HQ from capital & several air bases, early warning radar stations & mobile anti air craft missile & artillery units. After completion of fibre optic project & radar stations, MIADS (Myanmar Integrated Air Defence System) becomes the most advance AD system in the region.\n \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Each SOC transmitted data back to Intercept Operations Centers (IOC), which in turn controlled [[surface-to-air missile]] batteries and [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]]/[[Interceptor aircraft|interceptor]] squadrons at various Air Bases. Each IOC was optimised to direct either SAMs or fighter/interceptor aircraft against incoming enemy aircraft or missile. Each IOC was connected to observer and early warning area reporting posts (RP) via military owned underground fibre optic cable network. There were about 100 [[radar|radar stations]] located at approximately 40 sites throughout the country. New Air Defence radars such as 1L117 radars, Galaxy Early Warning Radar and P series radars are installed in all radar stations.<ref name=\"DSHMRI\"/>\n \nEach Sector Operation Center (SOC) is commanded by a major general and it consists of one air defence division from Myanmar Army and one fighter-interceptor wing from [[Myanmar Air Force]]. Sometimes Air Defence [[Frigate]]s from Myanmar Navy also operate under the direct command of respective SOC.\n \nEach Air Defence division is commanded by a brigadier general and consists of three Air Defence Tactical Operations Command (TOC) and support units. One Medium Range Surface to Air Missile Tactical Operations Command (MRSAM-TOC), with three battalions equipped with [[Buk missile system|Buk M-1]] or [[2K12 Kub|Kub]] missile system is deployed in an Area Defence Belt role. One Short Range Air Defence Tactical Operations Command (SHORAD-TOC), with three battalions equipped with [[Tor M-1]] missile system is deployed in a Point Defence role for critical areas such as radar stations, fighter bases and SOC headquarters. One Electronic Reconnaissance Tactical Operations Command (EIR-TOC) with 6 to 8 radar and communication companies for early warnings and interdiction detection.\n \nEach fighter-interceptor wing commanded by a [[brigadier general]] and is composed of three Fighter squadrons of either [[MiG-29]] and [[Chengdu J-7|F-7M Airguardi]]Interceptors (ten aircraft per squadron) and their ground base support units.<ref name=\"DSHMRI\"/>\n \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It consisted HQ Burma Signals, Burma Signal Training Squadron (BSTS) and Burma Signals Squadron.  HQ Burma Signals was located within War Office.  BSTS based in Pyain Oo Lwin was formed with Operating Cipher Training Troop, Dispacth Rider Training Troop, Lineman Training Troop, Radio Mechanic Training Troop and Regimental Signals Training Troop.  BSS, based in Mingalardon, had nince sections: Administration Troop, Maintenance Troop, Operating Troop, Cipher Troop, Lineman and Dispatch Rider Troop, NBSD Signals Troop, SBSD Signals Troop, Mobile Brigade Signals Toop and Arakan Signals Toop.  The then Chief of Signal Staff Officer (CSO) was Lieutenant Colonel Saw Aung Din.  BSTS and BSS were later renamed No. 1 Signal Battalion and No.1 Signal Training Battalion.  In 1952, the Infantry Divisional Signals Regiment was formed and later renamed to No. 2 Signal Battalion.  HQ Burma Signals was reorganised and became Directorate Signal and the director was elevated to the rank of Colonel.  In 1956, No. 1 Signal Security Battalion was formed, followed by No. 3 Signal Battalion in November 1958 and No.4 Signal Battalion in October 1959.\n \nIn 1961, signal battalions were reorganised as No. 11 Signal Battalion under North Eastern Regional Military Command, No. 121 Signal Battalion under Eastern Command, No. 313 Signal Battalion under Central Command, No.414 Signal Battalion under South Western Command, and No. 515 Signal Battalion under South Eastern Command.  No.1 Signal Training Battalion was renamed Burma Signal Training Depot (Baho-Setthweye-Tat).\n \nBy 1988, Directorate of Signals command one training depot, eight signal battalions, one signal security battalion, one signal store depot and two signal workshops.  Signal Corps under Directorate of Signal further expanded during 1990 expansion and reorganisation of Myanmar Armed Forces.  By 2000, a signal battalion is attached to each Regional Military Command and signal companies are now attached to Light Infantry Divisions and Military Operations Commands.\n \nIn 2000, [[C4ISTAR|Command, Control and Communication]] system of Myanmar Army has been substantially upgraded by setting up the military [[fibre optic]] communication network managed by Directorate of Signal throughout the country. Since 2002 all Myanmar Army Regional Military Command HQs used its own telecommunication system. [[Satellite communication|Satellite communication links]] are also provided to forward-deployed infantry battalions. However, battle field communication systems are still poor. Infantry units are still using TRA 906 and PRM 4051 which were acquired from UK in the 1980s. Myanmar Army also uses the locally built TRA 906 Thura and Chinese XD-D6M radio sets. Frequency hopping handsets are fitted to all front line units.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.burmanet.org/news/2010/08/13/jane%E2%80%99s-intelligence-review-radio-active-%E2%80%93-desmond-ball-and-samuel-blythe/|title=Burmanet \" Jane's Intelligence Review: Radio active \u2013 Desmond Ball and Samuel Blythe|accessdate=29 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141206031853/http://www.burmanet.org/news/2010/08/13/jane%E2%80%99s-intelligence-review-radio-active-%E2%80%93-desmond-ball-and-samuel-blythe/#|archive-date=6 December 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n \nBetween 2000 and 2005, Myanmar army bought 50 units of Brett 2050 Advanced Tech radio set from Aussie through third party from Singapore.

For centuries, [[Poland]] was home to the largest and most significant [[Jew]]ish community in the world. Poland was a principal center of [[Jewish culture]], thanks to a long period of statutory [[toleration|religious tolerance]] and [[Qahal|social autonomy]] which ended with the [[Partitions of Poland]] in the 18th century. During [[World War II]] there was a nearly complete [[genocide|genocidal]] destruction of the Polish Jewish community by [[Nazi Germany]] and its collaborators, during the 1939\u20131945 [[German occupation of Poland]] and the ensuing [[the Holocaust|Holocaust]]. Since the [[fall of communism in Poland]], there has been a renewed interest in Jewish culture, featuring an annual [[Jewish Culture Festival]], new study programs at Polish secondary schools and universities, and [[Warsaw]]'s [[Museum of the History of Polish Jews]].\n\nFrom the founding of the [[Kingdom of Poland (1025\u20131385)|Kingdom of Poland]] in 1025 through to the early years of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] [[Union of Lublin|created in 1569]], [[Poland]] was the most tolerant country in Europe.<ref name=\"Hugh\"/> Historians have used the label ''[[Heaven for the nobles, Purgatory for the townspeople, Hell for the peasants, and Paradise for the Jews|paradisus iudaeorum]]'' ([[Latin]] for \"[[Paradise]] of the Jews\").<ref name=\"Engel2009\">Engel, David. \"On Reconciling the Histories of Two Chosen Peoples.\" The American Historical Review 114.4 (2009): 914-929.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.polin.pl/en/wystawy-wystawa-glowna-galerie/paradisus-iudaeorum|title=Paradisus Iudaeorum (1569\u20131648)|website=POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews|date=13 May 2013}}</ref> The country became a shelter for persecuted and expelled European Jewish communities and the home to the world's largest Jewish community of the time. According to some sources, about three-quarters of the world's Jews lived in Poland by the middle of the 16th century.<ref name=\"Sanford\"/><ref name=\"EJC\"/><ref name=\"relations\"/> With the weakening of the Commonwealth and growing religious strife (due to the [[Protestant Reformation]] and [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Counter-Reformation]]), Poland's traditional tolerance<ref name=\"Central\"/> began to wane from the 17th century onward.<ref name=\"Note\"/> After the [[Partitions of Poland]] in 1795 and the destruction of Poland as a [[sovereign state]], Polish Jews were subject to the laws of the partitioning powers, the increasingly [[Anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire|antisemitic Russian Empire]],<ref name=\"partners-1\"/> as well as [[Austria-Hungary]] and [[Kingdom of Prussia]] (later a part of the [[German Empire]]). Still, as Poland regained independence in the [[aftermath of World War I]], it was the center of the European Jewish world with one of the world's largest Jewish communities of over 3 million. [[Antisemitism]] was a growing problem throughout Europe in those years, from both the political establishment and the general population.<ref name=\"Hagen-1\"/> Throughout the [[interwar period]], Poland supported Jewish emigration from Poland and, on the international arena, the creation of a Jewish state in [[Palestine]]. The Polish state also supported Jewish paramilitary groups such as the [[Haganah]], [[Betar]], and [[Irgun]], providing them with weapons and training.<ref>\"In 1937, the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs viewed the [[League of Nations]] as the right place for manifesting its support for the cause of developing a Jewish state in Palestine. This had been declared at the League by Foreign Minister [[J\u00f3zef Beck]].11 He also supported the idea of an international conference and campaign for organising and facilitating Jewish emigration.12 Talks were held with British Foreign Secretary [[Anthony Eden]], and in the US, with President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. Jewish members of the [[Sejm]] who protested against the heightened [[antisemitism]] in Poland took pains to thank Beck for furthering the cause of establishing a Jewish state in Palestine.\" [[Szymon Rudnicki]], [[Marek Karliner]] & [[Laurence Weinbaum]], \"Linking the Vistula and the Jordan: The Genesis of Relations between Poland and the State of Israel\", ''[[Israel Journal of Foreign Affairs]]'', 8:1, 2014, pp. 103-114.</ref><ref>\"Rydz Smig\u0142y agreed to support [[Irgun]], The [[Zionists]]' military arm, for the fight in [[Palestine]].

One-fifth of the Polish population perished during World War II; the 3,000,000 Polish Jews murdered in [[The Holocaust]], who constituted 90% of Polish Jewry, made up half of all Poles killed during the war.<ref>{{cite web | title=The Hidden Jews of Poland | website=Shavei Israel | date=22 November 2015 | url=https://shavei.org/communities/hidden-jews-poland/ | access-date=20 February 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"YV-archive1\"/> Although the Holocaust occurred largely in [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u201345)|German-occupied Poland]], there was little collaboration with the Nazis by its citizens.

In 1423 the statute of Warka forbade Jews the granting of loans against letters of credit or mortgage and limited their operations exclusively to loans made on security of moveable property.<ref name=polishjews.org/> In the 14th and 15th centuries rich Jewish merchants and moneylenders leased the royal mint, salt mines and the collecting of customs and tolls.

For example, Wolczko of Drohobycz, King Ladislaus Jagiello's broker, was the owner of several villages in the Ruthenian voivodship and the soltys (administrator) of the village of Werbiz. Also Jews from Grodno were in this period owners of villages, manors, meadows, fish ponds and mills. However until the end of the 15th century agriculture as a source of income played only a minor role among Jewish families.

As a result, Jews were banished from Lower Silesia. Zbigniew Olesnicki then invited John to conduct a similar campaign in Krak\u00f3w and several other cities, to lesser effect. In 1495, Jews were ordered out of the center of Krak\u00f3w and allowed to settle in the \"Jewish town\" of Kazimierz.

Indeed, with the expulsion of the [[History of the Jews in Spain|Jews from Spain]], Poland became the recognized haven for exiles from Western Europe; and the resulting accession to the ranks of Polish Jewry made it the cultural and spiritual center of the Jewish people.\n\nThe most prosperous period for Polish Jews began following this new influx of Jews with the reign of [[Sigismund I the Old]] (1506\u20131548), who protected the Jews in his realm. His son, [[Sigismund II Augustus]] (1548\u20131572), mainly followed his father's tolerant policy and also granted communal-administration autonomy to the Jews and laid the foundation for the power of the ''[[Qahal]]'', or autonomous Jewish community. This period led to the creation of a proverb about Poland being a \"heaven for the Jews\". According to some sources, about three-quarters of all Jews lived in Poland by the middle of the 16th century.<ref name=Sanford/><ref name=EJC/><ref name=\"relations\"/> In the middle of the 16th century, Poland welcomed the Jewish newcomers from [[Italy]] and [[Turkey]], mostly of [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]] origin. Jewish religious life thrived in many Polish communities. In 1503, the Polish monarchy appointed Rabbi [[Jacob Pollak]], the official Rabbi of Poland, marking the emergence of the Chief Rabbinate. By 1551, Jews were given permission to choose their own Chief Rabbi. The Chief Rabbinate held power over law and finance, appointing judges and other officials. Some power was shared with local councils. The Polish government permitted the Rabbinate to grow in power, to use it for tax collection purposes. Only 30% of the money raised by the Rabbinate served Jewish causes, the rest went to the Crown for protection. In this period Poland-Lithuania became the main center for Ashkenazi Jewry and its ''[[yeshiva|yeshivot]]'' achieved fame from the early 16th century.\n\n[[Moses Isserles]] (1520\u20131572), an eminent [[Talmud]]ist of the 16th century, established his [[yeshiva]] in [[Krak\u00f3w]].

Poland continued to be the spiritual center of Judaism. Through 1698, the Polish kings generally remained supportive of the Jews. Although Jewish losses in those events were high, the Commonwealth lost one third of its population \u2014 approximately three million of its citizens.\n\nThe environment of the Polish Commonwealth, according to Hundert, profoundly affected Jews due to genuinely positive encounter with the Christian culture across the many cities and towns owned by the Polish aristocracy. There was no isolation.{{sfn|Hundert|2004|pp=51\u201352}} The Jewish dress resembled that of their Polish neighbor. \"Reports of romances, of drinking together in taverns, and of intellectual conversations are quite abundant.\" Wealthy Jews had Polish noblemen at their table, and served meals on silver plates.{{sfn|Hundert|2004|pp=51\u201352}} By 1764, there were about 750,000 Jews in the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]].

The \"message\" was that Poland was meant to be a good place for the Jews. During the time from the rule of [[Sigismund I the Old]] until the Nazi [[Holocaust]], Poland would be at the center of Jewish religious life. Many agreed with Rabbi [[David HaLevi Segal|David ben Shemu\u2019el ha-Levi]] (Taz) that Poland was a place where \"most of the time the gentiles do no harm; on the contrary they do right by Israel\" (''Divre David;'' 1689).<ref>[[David HaLevi Segal|David ben Samuel Ha-Levi]], \"Divre \u0304 David Ture \u0304 Zahav\" (1689) in Hebrew.

Such schools were officially known as [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasiums]], and their rabbi principals as [[Rector (academia)|rectors]]. Important ''yeshivot'' existed in Krak\u00f3w, Pozna\u0144, and other cities. Jewish printing establishments came into existence in the first quarter of the 16th century. In 1530 a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[Pentateuch]] ([[Torah]]) was printed in Krak\u00f3w; and at the end of the century the Jewish printing houses of that city and [[Lublin]] issued a large number of Jewish books, mainly of a religious character. The growth of [[Talmud|Talmudic scholarship]] in Poland was coincident with the greater prosperity of the Polish Jews; and because of their communal autonomy educational development was wholly one-sided and along Talmudic lines. Exceptions are recorded, however, where Jewish youth sought secular instruction in the European universities. The learned rabbis became not merely expounders of the Law, but also spiritual advisers, teachers, judges, and legislators; and their authority compelled the communal leaders to make themselves familiar with the abstruse questions of [[Halakha|Jewish law]]. Polish Jewry found its views of life shaped by the spirit of Talmudic and rabbinical literature, whose influence was felt in the home, in school, and in the synagogue.\n\nIn the first half of the 16th century the seeds of Talmudic learning had been transplanted to Poland from [[Bohemia]], particularly from the school of [[Jacob Pollak]], the creator of ''[[Pilpul]]'' (\"sharp reasoning\"). [[Shalom Shachna]] (c. 1500\u20131558), a pupil of Pollak, is counted among the pioneers of Talmudic learning in Poland. He lived and died in [[Lublin]], where he was the head of the ''yeshivah'' which produced the rabbinical celebrities of the following century. Shachna's son Israel became rabbi of Lublin on the death of his father, and Shachna's pupil [[Moses Isserles]] (known as the ''ReMA'') (1520\u20131572) achieved an international reputation among the Jews as the co-author of the ''[[Shulkhan Arukh]]'', (the \"Code of Jewish Law\"). His contemporary and correspondent [[Solomon Luria]] (1510\u20131573) of Lublin also enjoyed a wide reputation among his co-religionists; and the authority of both was recognized by the Jews throughout Europe. Heated religious disputations were common, and Jewish scholars participated in them. At the same time, the ''[[Kabbalah]]'' had become entrenched under the protection of [[Rabbinic Judaism|Rabbinism]]; and such scholars as [[Mordecai Jaffe]] and [[Yoel Sirkis]] devoted themselves to its study. This period of great Rabbinical scholarship was interrupted by the [[Chmielnicki Uprising]] and [[The Deluge (Polish history)|The Deluge]].\n\n===The rise of Hasidism===\n[[File:Jakub Frank.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jacob Frank]]]]\n{{main|Hasidic Judaism}}\nThe decade from the [[Chmielnicki Uprising|Cossacks' uprising]] until after the [[The Deluge (Polish history)|Swedish war]] (1648\u20131658) left a deep and lasting impression not only on the social life of the Polish-Lithuanian Jews, but on their spiritual life as well. The intellectual output of the Jews of Poland was reduced. The Talmudic learning which up to that period had been the common possession of the majority of the people became accessible to a limited number of students only. What religious study there was became overly formalized, some rabbis busied themselves with quibbles concerning religious laws; others wrote commentaries on different parts of the Talmud in which hair-splitting arguments were raised and discussed; and at times these arguments dealt with matters which were of no practical importance. At the same time, many miracle workers made their appearance among the Jews of Poland, culminating in a series of false \"Messianic\" movements, most famously as [[Sabbatai Zevi|Sabbatianism]] was succeeded by [[Jacob Frank|Frankism]].\n\nIn this time of [[mysticism]] and overly formal rabbinism came the teachings of [[Israel ben Eliezer]], known as the ''Baal Shem Tov'', or ''BeShT'', (1698\u20131760), which had a profound effect on the Jews of [[Eastern Europe]] and Poland in particular. His disciples taught and encouraged the new fervent brand of [[Judaism]] based on ''[[Kabbalah]]'' known as [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidism]]. The rise of Hasidic Judaism within Poland's borders and beyond had a great influence on the rise of [[Haredi Judaism]] all over the world, with a continuous influence through its many [[List of Hasidic dynasties|Hasidic dynasties]] including those of [[Chabad-Lubavitch]], [[Aleksander (Hasidic dynasty)|Aleksander]], [[Bobov (Hasidic dynasty)|Bobov]], [[Ger (Hasidic dynasty)|Ger]], [[Nadvorna (Hasidic dynasty)|Nadvorna]], among others.\n\n==The Partitions of Poland==\n[[File:Jewish dress in Poland 17th and 18th century.jpg|thumb|upright|Jewish dress in 17th ''(top)'' and 18th centuries]]\nIn 1742 most of Silesia was lost to [[Prussia]]. Further disorder and anarchy reigned supreme in Poland during the second half of the 18th century, from the accession to the throne of its last king, [[Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski|Stanislaus II Augustus Poniatowski]] in 1764.

The progressive elements in Polish society recognized the urgency of popular education as the very first step toward reform. The famous ''[[Komisja Edukacji Narodowej]]'' (\"Commission of National Education\"), the first ministry of education in the world, was established in 1773 and founded numerous new schools and remodeled the old ones. One of the members of the commission, ''[[kanclerz]]'' [[Andrzej Zamoyski]], along with others, demanded that the inviolability of their persons and property should be guaranteed and that religious toleration should be to a certain extent granted them; but he insisted that Jews living in the cities should be separated from the Christians, that those of them having no definite occupation should be banished from the kingdom, and that even those engaged in agriculture should not be allowed to possess land. On the other hand, some ''szlachta'' and intellectuals proposed a national system of government, of the civil and political equality of the Jews. This was the only example in modern Europe before the [[French Revolution]] of tolerance and broadmindedness in dealing with the Jewish question. But all these reforms were too late: a Russian army soon invaded Poland, and soon after a Prussian one followed.\n[[File:Berek joselewicz.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Berek Joselewicz]] (1764\u20131809)]]\nA second [[Partitions of Poland|partition of Poland]] was made on 17 July 1793.

Following the revolt, the third and final partition of Poland took place in 1795. The territories which included the great bulk of the Jewish population was transferred to Russia, and thus they became subjects of that empire, although in the first half of the 19th century some semblance of a vastly smaller Polish state was preserved, especially in the form of the [[Congress Poland]] (1815\u20131831).\n\nUnder foreign rule many Jews inhabiting formerly Polish lands were indifferent to Polish aspirations for independence.

The lands that had once been Poland were to remain the home of many Jews, as, in 1772, [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]], the ''Tzarina'' of Russia, instituted the [[Pale of Settlement]], restricting Jews to the western parts of the empire, which would eventually include much of Poland, although it excluded some areas in which Jews had previously lived. By the late 19th century, over four million Jews would live in the Pale.\n\nTsarist policy towards the Jews of Poland alternated between harsh rules, and inducements meant to break the resistance to large-scale conversion.

The Polish Jews were allowed to establish schools with Russian, German or Polish curricula. They could own land in the territories annexed from Poland. However, they were also restricted from leasing property, teaching in Yiddish, and from entering Russia. They were banned from the [[brewing industry]]. The harshest measures designed to compel Jews to merge into society at large called for their expulsion from small villages, forcing them to move into towns. Once the resettlement began, thousands of Jews lost their only source of income and turned to [[Qahal]] for support. Their living conditions in [[Pale of Settlement|the Pale]] began to dramatically worsen.<ref name=\"Alexander_I\"/>\n\nDuring the reign of [[Nicholas I of Russia|Tsar Nicolas I]], known by the Jews as \"[[Haman (Bible)|Haman]] the Second\", hundreds of new anti-Jewish measures were enacted.<ref name=\"Nicholas_I\"/> The 1827 decree by Nicolas \u2013 while lifting the traditional double taxation on Jews in lieu of army service \u2013 made Jews subject to general military recruitment laws that required Jewish communities to provide 7 recruits per each 1000 \"souls\" every 4 years. Unlike the general population that had to provide recruits between the ages of 18 and 35, Jews had to provide recruits between the ages of 12 and 25, at the [[qahal]]'s discretion. Thus between 1827 and 1857 over 30,000 children were placed in the so-called [[Cantonist]] schools, where they were pressured to convert.<ref>{{cite book |year=2009 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Jews_In_The_Russian_Army_1827_1917.html?id=9NoMdyNVtBYC |title=Jews in the Russian Army, 1827\u20131917: Drafted Into Modernity |author=\u012cokhanan Petrovski\u012d-Shtern |publisher=Cambridge University Press |via=Books.google.com |accessdate=26 March 2013|isbn = 9780521515733}}</ref> \"Many children were smuggled to Poland, where the conscription of Jews did not take effect until 1844.\"<ref name=\"Nicholas_I\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LzFd2W-C6BAC&lpg=PA13&dq=%22Tsar%20Nicholas%20enacted%20hundreds%20of%20anti-Jewish%20measures.%22&pg=PA13#v=onepage&q=%22Tsar%20Nicholas%20enacted%20hundreds%20of%20anti-Jewish%20measures.%22&f=false |title=''The Cantonists: the Jewish children's army of the Tsar'' |year=2003 |accessdate=11 March 2012 |first=Larry |last=Domnitch |pages=12\u201315|isbn=9781930143852 }}</ref>\n{{details|topic=the Garrison schools for male children|Cantonist}}\n\n===Pale of Settlement===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}\n[[File:Map showing the percentage of Jews in the Pale of Settlement and Congress Poland, The Jewish Encyclopedia (1905).jpg|thumb|Map of [[Pale of Settlement]], showing Jewish population densities]]\nThe ''[[Pale of Settlement]]'' ({{lang-ru|\u0427\u0435\u0440\u0442\u0430\u0301 \u043e\u0441\u0435\u0301\u0434\u043b\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438}}, {{transl|ru|chert\u00e1 os\u00e9dlosti}}, {{lang-yi|\u05ea\u05bc\u05d7\u05d5\u05dd-\u05d4\u05de\u05d5\u05e9\u05d1\u05bf}}, {{transl|yi|tkhum-ha-moysh\u0259v}}, {{lang-he|\u05ea\u05b0\u05bc\u05d7\u05d5\u05bc\u05dd \u05d4\u05b7\u05de\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9\u05e9\u05b8\u05d1}}, {{transl|he|t\u1e25\u00f9m ha-mosh\u00e1v}}) was the term given to a region of [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]] in which permanent residency by [[Ashkenazi Jews|Jews]] was allowed and beyond which Jewish permanent residency was generally prohibited.  It extended from the eastern ''pale'', or demarcation line, to the western Russian border with the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] (later the [[German Empire]]) and with [[Austria-Hungary]].\nThe archaic English term ''pale'' is derived from the [[Latin]] word {{lang|la|[[:wikt:palus#Latin|palus]]}}, a stake, extended to mean the area enclosed by a fence or boundary.\n\nWith its large Catholic and Jewish populations, the Pale was acquired by the Russian Empire (which was a majority [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]]) in a series of military conquests and diplomatic maneuvers between 1791 and 1835, and lasted until the fall of the Russian Empire in 1917. It comprised about 20% of the territory of European Russia and mostly corresponded to historical borders of the former [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]]; it covered much of present-day [[Lithuania]], [[Belarus]], [[Poland]], [[Moldova]], [[Ukraine]], and parts of western [[Russia]].\n\nFrom 1791 to 1835, and until 1917, there were differing reconfigurations of the boundaries of the Pale, such that certain areas were variously open or shut to Jewish residency, such as the [[Caucasus]]. At times, Jews were forbidden to live in agricultural communities, or certain cities, as in [[Kiev]], [[Sevastopol]] and [[Yalta]], excluded from residency at a number of cities within the Pale. Settlers from  outside the pale were forced to move to small towns, thus fostering the rise of the ''[[shtetl]]s''.\n\nAlthough the Jews were accorded slightly more rights with the [[Emancipation reform of 1861]] by [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]], they were still restricted to the [[Pale of Settlement]] and subject to restrictions on ownership and profession. The existing [[status quo]] was shattered with the [[Alexander II of Russia#Assassination|assassination of Alexander]] in 1881 \u2013 an act falsely blamed upon the Jews.\n\n===Pogroms in the Russian Empire===\n[[File:Pogrom bialystok.jpg|thumb|upright|Caricature of [[Russian Army]] assailant in 1906 [[Bia\u0142ystok pogrom]]]]\nThe assassination prompted a large-scale wave of anti-Jewish riots, called ''[[pogroms]]'' ({{lang-ru|\u043f\u043e\u0433\u0440\u043e\u0301\u043c}};) throughout 1881\u20131884.

Pogroms continued until 1884, with at least tacit government approval. They proved a turning point in the history of the Jews in [[partitioned Poland]] and throughout the world. In 1884, 36 Jewish [[Zionism|Zionist]] delegates [[Katowice Conference|met in Katowice]], forming the [[Hovevei Zion]] movement.

They included the [[Bia\u0142ystok pogrom]] of 1906 in the [[Grodno Governorate]] of Russian Poland, in which at least 75 Jews were murdered by marauding soldiers and many more Jews were wounded.

Champions of ''Haskalah'', the ''[[Haskalah|Maskilim]]'', pushed for assimilation and integration into Russian culture. At the same time, there was another school of Jewish thought that emphasized traditional study and a Jewish response to the ethical problems of antisemitism and persecution, one form of which was the [[Musar movement]]. Polish Jews generally were less influenced by ''Haskalah'', rather focusing on a strong continuation of their religious lives based on [[Halakha]] (\"rabbis's law\") following primarily [[Orthodox Judaism]], [[Hasidic Judaism]], and also adapting to the new [[Religious Zionism]] of the [[Mizrachi (Religious Zionism)|Mizrachi]] movement later in the 19th century.\n\n===Politics in Polish territory===\n[[File:ac.manif1917.jpg|thumb|A [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|Bund]]ist demonstration, 1917]]\nBy the late 19th century, ''Haskalah'' and the debates it caused created a growing number of political movements within the Jewish community itself, covering a wide range of views and vying for votes in local and regional elections. Zionism became very popular with the advent of the ''[[Poale Zion]]'' socialist party as well as the religious [[Polish Mizrahi]], and the increasingly popular [[General Zionists]]. Jews also took up [[socialism]], forming the [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|Bund]] [[labor union]] which supported assimilation and the [[rights of labor]]. The [[Folkspartei]] (People's Party) advocated, for its part, cultural autonomy and resistance to assimilation. In 1912, ''[[Agudat Israel]]'', a religious party, came into existence.\n\nMany Jews took part in the Polish insurrections, particularly against Russia (since the Tsars discriminated heavily against the Jews). The [[Ko\u015bciuszko Insurrection]] (1794), [[November Insurrection]] (1830\u201331), [[January Insurrection]] (1863) and [[Russian Revolution of 1905|Revolutionary Movement of 1905]] all saw significant Jewish involvement in the cause of Polish independence.\n\nDuring the [[Second Polish Republic]] period, there were several prominent Jewish politicians in the Polish Sejm, such as [[Apolinary Hartglas]] and [[Yitzhak Gruenbaum]]. Many Jewish political parties were active, representing a wide ideological spectrum, from the Zionists, to the socialists to the anti-Zionists. One of the largest of these parties was the Bund, which was strongest in Warsaw and Lodz.\n\nIn addition to the socialists, Zionist parties were also popular, in particular, the Marxist [[Poale Zion]] and the orthodox religious Polish Mizrahi. The [[General Zionists|General Zionist]] party became the most prominent Jewish party in the interwar period and in the 1919 elections to the [[Polish legislative election, 1919|first Polish Sejm]] since the partitions, gained 50% of the Jewish vote.\n\nIn 1914, the German Zionist [[Max Bodenheimer]] founded the short-lived [[German Committee for Freeing of Russian Jews]], with the goal of establishing a buffer state (''Pufferstaat'') within the Jewish Pale of Settlement, composed of the [[Partitions of Poland|former Polish provinces annexed by Russia]], being ''de facto'' [[protectorate]] of the [[German Empire]] that would free Jews in the region from Russian oppression. The plan, known as the [[League of East European States]], soon proved unpopular with both German officials and Bodenheimer's colleagues, and was dead by the following year.<ref>[[Walter Laqueur]].

Yiddish authors, most notably [[Isaac Bashevis Singer]], went on to achieve international acclaim as classic Jewish writers; Singer won the 1978 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. His brother [[Israel Joshua Singer]] was also a writer. Other Jewish authors of the period, such as [[Bruno Schulz]], [[Julian Tuwim]], [[Marian Hemar]], [[Emanuel Schlechter]] and [[Boles\u0142aw Le\u015bmian]], as well as [[Konrad Tom]] and [[Jerzy Jurandot]], were less well known internationally, but made important contributions to Polish literature. Some Polish writers had Jewish roots e.g. [[Jan Brzechwa]] (a favorite poet of Polish children). Singer [[Jan Kiepura]], born of a Jewish mother and Polish father, was one of the most popular artists of that era, and pre-war songs of Jewish composers, including [[Henryk Wars]], [[Jerzy Petersburski]], [[Artur Gold]], [[Henryk Gold]], [[Zygmunt Bia\u0142ostocki]], [[Szymon Kataszek]] and [[Jakub Kagan]], are still widely known in Poland today. Painters became known as well for their depictions of Jewish life. Among them were [[Maurycy Gottlieb]], [[Artur Markowicz]], and [[Maurycy Trebacz]], with younger artists like [[Chaim Goldberg]] coming up in the ranks.\n\nMany Jews were film producers and directors, e.g. [[Micha\u0142 Waszy\u0144ski]] (''[[The Dybbuk (film)|The Dybbuk)]]'', [[Aleksander Ford]] (''[[Children Must Laugh]]'').\n\n[[File:Shimon Peres, Yasser Arafat - World Economic Forum Annual Meeting Davos 2001.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Shimon Peres]], born in Poland as Szymon Perski,  served as the ninth [[President of Israel]] between 2007 and 2014]]\n\nScientist [[Leopold Infeld]], mathematician [[Stanislaw Ulam]], [[Alfred Tarski]], and professor [[Adam Ulam]] contributed to the world of science.

The term \"[[genocide]]\" was coined by [[Rafa\u0142 Lemkin]] (1900\u20131959), a Polish-Jewish legal scholar. [[Leonid Hurwicz]] was awarded the 2007 [[Nobel Prize in Economics]]. The [[YIVO]] (Jidiszer Wissenszaftlecher Institute) Scientific Institute was based in Wilno before transferring to New York during the war. In Warsaw, important centers of Judaic scholarship, such the [[Main Judaic Library]] and the Institute of Judaic Studies were located, along with numerous Talmudic Schools (Jeszybots), religious centers and synagogues, many of which were of high architectural quality. [[Yiddish theatre]] also flourished; Poland had fifteen Yiddish theatres and theatrical groups. Warsaw was home to the most important Yiddish theater troupe of the time, the [[Vilna Troupe]], which staged the first performance of ''[[The Dybbuk]]'' in 1920 at the Elyseum Theatre. Some future Israeli leaders studied at [[University of Warsaw]], including [[Menachem Begin]] and [[Yitzhak Shamir]].\n\nThere also were several Jewish sports clubs, with some of them, such as [[Hasmonea Lwow]] and [[Jutrzenka Krak\u00f3w]], winning promotion to the [[Ekstraklasa|Polish First Football League]]. A Polish-Jewish footballer, [[J\u00f3zef Klotz]], scored the first ever goal for the [[Poland national football team]].

This had been declared  at the League by Foreign Minister J\u00f3zef Beck.11 He also supported the idea of an international conference and campaign for organizing and facilitating Jewish emigration.12 Talks were held with British Foreign Secretary [[Anthony Eden]], and in the US, with President Franklin D.

According to Irgun activists, the Polish state supplied the organisation with 25,000 rifles, additional material and weapons, and by summer 1939 Irgun's Warsaw warehouses held 5,000 rifles and 1,000 machine guns.

A larger number of younger Jews, often through the pro-Marxist Bund or some Zionist groups, were sympathetic to [[Communism]] and Soviet Russia, both of which had been enemies of the [[Polish Second Republic]].

The Jewish fighters also received support from the Polish Underground ([[Armia Krajowa]]). The German forces, which included 2,842 Nazi soldiers and 7,000 security personnel, were not capable of crushing the Jewish resistance in open street combat and after several days, decided to switch strategy by setting buildings on fire in which the Jewish fighters hid. The commander of the \u017bOB, [[Mordechai Anielewicz]], died fighting on 8 May 1943 at the organization's command centre on 18 Mila Street.\n[[File:Gesiowka commemorative plaque at 34 Anielewicza Street.JPG|thumb|left|34 [[Mordechaj Anielewicz]] Street, Warsaw, Poland]]\n\nIt took the Germans twenty-seven days to put down the uprising, after some very heavy fighting. The German general [[J\u00fcrgen Stroop]] in his report stated that his troops had killed 6,065 Jewish fighters during the battle. After the uprising was already over, [[Heinrich Himmler]] had the Great Synagogue on T\u0142omackie Square (outside the ghetto) destroyed as a celebration of German victory and a symbol that the Jewish Ghetto in Warsaw was no longer.\n\nA group of fighters escaped from the ghetto through the sewers and reached the Lomianki forest. About 50 ghetto fighters were saved by the Polish \"People's Guard\" and later formed their own partisan group, named after Anielewicz. Even after the end of the uprising there were still several hundreds of Jews who continued living in the ruined ghetto. Many of them survived thanks to the contacts they managed to establish with Poles outside the ghetto. The Uprising inspired Jews throughout Poland. Many Jewish leaders who survived the liquidation continued underground work outside the ghetto. They hid other Jews, forged necessary documents and were active in the [[Polish underground]] in other parts of Warsaw and surrounding area.\n[[File:Gesiowka.jpg|thumb|right|Freed prisoners of [[G\u0119si\u00f3wka]] and the ''[[Szare Szeregi]]'' fighters after the liberation of the camp in August 1944]]\n\nWarsaw Ghetto Uprising, was followed by other [[Ghetto uprising]]s in many smaller towns and cities across German occupied Poland.

Only a few of them survived. The Polish commander of one Jewish unit, [[Waclaw Micuta]], described them as some of the best fighters, always at the front line.

Some 166,000 people lost their lives in the 1944 Warsaw Uprising, including perhaps as many as 17,000 Polish Jews who had either fought with the [[Armia Krajowa|AK]] or had been discovered in hiding (''see:'' [[Krzysztof Kamil Baczy\u0144ski]] and [[Stanis\u0142aw Aronson]]). Warsaw was razed to the ground by the Germans and more than 150,000 Poles were sent to labor or concentration camps. On 17 January 1945, the [[Soviet Army]] entered a destroyed and nearly uninhabited Warsaw. Some 300 Jews were found hiding in the ruins in the Polish part of the city (''see:'' [[Wladyslaw Szpilman]]).\n[[File:Ghetto Uprising Warsaw2.jpg|thumb|The [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] of 1943 saw the destruction of what remained of the Ghetto]]\n\nThe fate of the Warsaw Ghetto was similar to that of the other ghettos in which Jews were concentrated. With the decision of [[Nazi Germany]] to begin the [[Final Solution]], the destruction of the Jews of Europe, [[Aktion Reinhard]] began in 1942, with the opening of the extermination camps of Be\u0142\u017cec, Sobib\u00f3r, and Treblinka, followed by Auschwitz-Birkenau where people were killed in gas chambers and mass executions (death wall).<ref name=\"Auschwitz-Birkenau Concentration Camp - Advice from a Tour Guide\"/> Many died from hunger, starvation, disease, torture or by pseudo-medical experiments. The mass deportation of Jews from ghettos to these camps, such as happened at the Warsaw Ghetto, soon followed, and more than 1.7 million Jews were killed at the Aktion Reinhard camps by October 1943 alone.\n\n====The Bia\u0142ystok Ghetto and its uprising====\n{{main|Bia\u0142ystok Ghetto}}\n{{further|Bia\u0142ystok Ghetto Uprising}}\nIn August 1941, the Germans ordered the establishment of a [[ghetto]] in Bia\u0142ystok. About 50,000 Jews from the city and the surrounding region were confined in a small area of Bia\u0142ystok. The ghetto had two sections, divided by the [[Bia\u0142a River (Supra\u015bl basin)|Biala River]]. Most Jews in the Bia\u0142ystok ghetto worked in forced-labor projects, primarily in large textile factories located within the ghetto boundaries. The Germans also sometimes used Jews in forced-labor projects outside the ghetto.\n\nIn February 1943, approximately 10,000 Bia\u0142ystok Jews were deported to the [[Treblinka extermination camp]]. During the deportations, hundreds of Jews, mainly those deemed too weak or sick to travel, were killed.\n\nIn August 1943, the Germans mounted an operation to destroy the Bia\u0142ystok ghetto. German forces and local police auxiliaries surrounded the ghetto and began to round up Jews systematically for deportation to the Treblinka extermination camp. Approximately 7,600 Jews were held in a central transit camp in the city before deportation to Treblinka. Those deemed fit to work were sent to the [[Majdanek]] camp. In Majdanek, after another screening for ability to work, they were transported to the Poniatowa, Blizyn, or Auschwitz camps. Those deemed too weak to work were murdered at Majdanek. More than 1,000 Jewish children were sent first to the [[Theresienstadt concentration camp|Theresienstadt]] ghetto in [[Bohemia]], and then to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz-Birkenau]], where they were killed.\n\nOn 15 August 1943, the [[Bia\u0142ystok Ghetto Uprising]] began, and several hundred Polish Jews and members of the [[Anti-Fascist Military Organisation]] ({{lang-pl|Antyfaszystowska Organizacja Bojowa}}) started an armed struggle against the German troops who were carrying out the planned liquidation and deportation of the ghetto to the [[Treblinka extermination camp]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Ruch oporu w getcie bia\u0142ostockim.

The fighting in isolated pockets of resistance lasted for several days, but the defence was broken almost instantly. As with the earlier [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] of April 1943, the Bia\u0142ystok uprising had no chances for military success, but it was the second largest [[ghetto uprising]], after the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]]. Several dozen guerrillas managed to break through to the forests surrounding Bia\u0142ystok where they joined the partisan units of [[Armia Krajowa]] and other organisations and survived the war.\n\n==Communist rule: 1945\u20131989==\n{{main|History of Poland (1945\u20131989)}}\n\n===Number of Holocaust survivors===\nThe estimates of Polish Jews before the war vary from slightly under 3 million to almost 3.5 million ([[Polish census of 1931|the last nationwide census was conducted in 1931]]).<ref name=\":32\" />\n\nThe number of Polish Jews who survived the Holocaust is difficult to ascertain.

There are two rabbis serving the Polish Jewish community, several Jewish schools and associated summer camps as well as several periodical and book series sponsored by the above foundations. Jewish studies programs are offered at major universities, such as [[Warsaw University]] and the [[Jagiellonian University]].

Warsaw has an active synagogue, [[Beit Warszawa Synagogue|Beit Warszawa]], affiliated with the Liberal-Progressive stream of Judaism.\n\nThere are also several Jewish publications although most of them are in Polish. These include ''[[Midrasz]]'', ''Dos Jidische Wort'' (which is bilingual), as well as a youth journal ''Jidele'' and \"Sztendlach\" for young children. Active institutions include the Jewish Historical Institute, the E.R. Kaminska State Yiddish Theater in Warsaw, and the Jewish Cultural Center. The [[Judaica Foundation]] in Krak\u00f3w has sponsored a wide range of cultural and educational programs on Jewish themes for a predominantly Polish audience.

[[Jewish Cemetery, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a]] is one of the largest Jewish burial grounds in Europe, and preserved historic sites include those located in G\u00f3ra Kalwaria and [[Le\u017cajsk]] ([[Elimelech of Lizhensk|Elimelech's of Lizhensk]] [[ohel (grave)|ohel]]).<ref name=\"JVL\"/>\n\nThe Great Synagogue in [[O\u015bwi\u0119cim]] was excavated after testimony by a Holocaust survivor suggested that many Jewish relics and ritual objects had been buried there, just before Nazis took over the town. Candelabras, chandeliers, a menorah and a [[Ner Tamid|ner tamid]] were found and can now be seen at the Auschwitz Jewish Center.<ref name=\"JVL\"/>\n\nThe [[Warsaw Ghetto Memorial]] was unveiled on 19 April 1948\u2014the fifth anniversary of the outbreak of the Warsaw ghetto Uprising. It was constructed out of bronze and granite that the Nazis used for a monument honoring German victory over Poland and it was designed by [[Natan Rappaport]]. The Memorial is located where the Warsaw Ghetto used to be, at the site of one command bunker of the [[Jewish Combat Organization]].\n\nA memorial to the victims of the Kielce Pogrom of 1946, where a mob murdered more than 40 Jews who returned to the city after the Holocaust, was unveiled in 2006. The funds for the memorial came from the city itself and from the [[U.S. Commission for the Preservation of America's Heritage Abroad]].\n\nPolish authors and scholars have published many works about history of Jews in Poland. Notable among them are the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]]'s [[Holocaust studies]] journal {{ill|Zag\u0142ada \u017byd\u00f3w. Studia i Materia\u0142y|pl|Zag\u0142ada \u017byd\u00f3w.

The synagogue, the sole synagogue in O\u015bwi\u0119cim to survive World War II and an adjacent Jewish cultural and educational center, provide visitors a place to pray and to learn about the active pre\u2013World War II Jewish community that existed in O\u015bwi\u0119cim. The synagogue was the first communal property in the country to be returned to the Jewish community under the 1997 law allowing for restitution of Jewish communal property.<ref name=\"Poland, International Religious Freedom Report\"/></blockquote>\nThe [[March of the Living]] is an annual event in April held since 1988 to commemorate the victims of the Holocaust.

For centuries, [[Poland]] was home to the largest and most significant [[Jew]]ish community in the world. Poland was a principal center of [[Jewish culture]], thanks to a long period of statutory [[toleration|religious tolerance]] and [[Qahal|social autonomy]] which ended with the [[Partitions of Poland]] in the 18th century. During [[World War II]] there was a nearly complete [[genocide|genocidal]] destruction of the Polish Jewish community by [[Nazi Germany]] and its collaborators, during the 1939\u20131945 [[German occupation of Poland]] and the ensuing [[the Holocaust|Holocaust]]. Since the [[fall of communism in Poland]], there has been a renewed interest in Jewish culture, featuring an annual [[Jewish Culture Festival]], new study programs at Polish secondary schools and universities, and [[Warsaw]]'s [[Museum of the History of Polish Jews]].\n\nFrom the founding of the [[Kingdom of Poland (1025\u20131385)|Kingdom of Poland]] in 1025 through to the early years of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] [[Union of Lublin|created in 1569]], [[Poland]] was the most tolerant country in Europe.<ref name=\"Hugh\"/> Historians have used the label ''[[Heaven for the nobles, Purgatory for the townspeople, Hell for the peasants, and Paradise for the Jews|paradisus iudaeorum]]'' ([[Latin]] for \"[[Paradise]] of the Jews\").<ref name=\"Engel2009\">Engel, David. \"On Reconciling the Histories of Two Chosen Peoples.\" The American Historical Review 114.4 (2009): 914-929.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.polin.pl/en/wystawy-wystawa-glowna-galerie/paradisus-iudaeorum|title=Paradisus Iudaeorum (1569\u20131648)|website=POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews|date=13 May 2013}}</ref> The country became a shelter for persecuted and expelled European Jewish communities and the home to the world's largest Jewish community of the time.

Still, as Poland regained independence in the [[aftermath of World War I]], it was the center of the European Jewish world with one of the world's largest Jewish communities of over 3 million. [[Antisemitism]] was a growing problem throughout Europe in those years, from both the political establishment and the general population.<ref name=\"Hagen-1\"/> Throughout the [[interwar period]], Poland supported Jewish emigration from Poland and, on the international arena, the creation of a Jewish state in [[Palestine]]. The Polish state also supported Jewish paramilitary groups such as the [[Haganah]], [[Betar]], and [[Irgun]], providing them with weapons and training.<ref>\"In 1937, the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs viewed the [[League of Nations]] as the right place for manifesting its support for the cause of developing a Jewish state in Palestine. This had been declared at the League by Foreign Minister [[J\u00f3zef Beck]].11 He also supported the idea of an international conference and campaign for organising and facilitating Jewish emigration.12 Talks were held with British Foreign Secretary [[Anthony Eden]], and in the US, with President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. Jewish members of the [[Sejm]] who protested against the heightened [[antisemitism]] in Poland took pains to thank Beck for furthering the cause of establishing a Jewish state in Palestine.\" [[Szymon Rudnicki]], [[Marek Karliner]] & [[Laurence Weinbaum]], \"Linking the Vistula and the Jordan: The Genesis of Relations between Poland and the State of Israel\", ''[[Israel Journal of Foreign Affairs]]'', 8:1, 2014, pp. 103-114.</ref><ref>\"Rydz Smig\u0142y agreed to support [[Irgun]], The [[Zionists]]' military arm, for the fight in [[Palestine]].

For example, they could define their neighborhoods and economic competitors and set up monopolies. This made it very attractive for Jewish communities to pick up and move to Poland.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://henryabramson.com/2013/12/05/origins-of-polish-jewry-this-week-in-jewish-history/|title=Origins of Polish Jewry (This Week in Jewish History)|date=5 December 2013|website=Henry Abramson}}</ref>\n\nThe first mention of Jewish settlers in [[P\u0142ock]] dates from 1237, in Kalisz from 1287 and a \u017bydowska (Jewish) street in Krak\u00f3w in 1304.<ref name=polishjews.org/>\n\nThe tolerant situation was gradually altered by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] on the one hand, and by the neighboring German states on the other.<ref name=\"Dubnow-1\"/> There were, however, among the reigning princes some determined protectors of the Jewish inhabitants, who considered the presence of the latter most desirable as far as the economic development of the country was concerned. Prominent among such rulers was [[Boles\u0142aw the Pious]] of [[Kalisz]], Prince of [[Great Poland]]. With the consent of the class representatives and higher officials, in 1264 he issued a General Charter of Jewish Liberties, the [[Statute of Kalisz]], which granted all Jews the freedom of worship, trade and travel. Similar privileges were granted to the Silesian Jews by the local princes, Prince Henry Probus of Wroc\u0142aw in 1273\u201390, Henry of Glogow in 1274 and 1299, Henry of Legnica in 1290 \u2013 95 and Bolko of Legnica and Wroc\u0142aw in 1295.<ref name=polishjews.org/> Article 31 of the Prince Boles\u0142aw of Kalisz's ''privilegium'' tried to rein in the Catholic Church from disseminating [[blood libel]]s against the Jews, by stating: \u201cAccusing Jews of drinking Christian blood is expressly prohibited.

However, those church decrees required the cooperation of the Polish princes for enforcement, which was generally not forthcoming, due to the profits which the Jews' economic activity yielded to the princes.<ref name=polishjews.org/>\n[[File:Wojciech Gerson, Przyj\u0119cie \u017byd\u00f3w.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|''[[Casimir the Great]] and the Jews'', by [[Wojciech Gerson]], 1874]]\nIn 1332, King [[Casimir III of Poland|Casimir III the Great]] (1303\u20131370) amplified and expanded Boles\u0142aw's old charter with the [[Wi\u015blicki Statute]]. Under his reign, streams of Jewish immigrants headed east to Poland and Jewish settlements are first mentioned as existing in [[Lviv|Lvov]] (1356), [[Sandomierz]] (1367), and [[Kazimierz]] near Krak\u00f3w (1386).<ref name=polishjews.org/> Casimir, who according to a legend had a Jewish lover named [[Esterka]] from [[Opoczno]]<ref name=\"opoczno-1\"/> was especially friendly to the Jews, and his reign is regarded as an era of great prosperity for Polish Jewry, and was nicknamed by his contemporaries \"King of the [[serf]]s and Jews.\" Under [[penalty of death]], he prohibited the kidnapping of Jewish children for the purpose of enforced [[Christianity|Christian]] [[baptism]]. He inflicted heavy punishment for the desecration of [[Jewish]] [[cemeteries]]. Nevertheless, while for the greater part of Casimir\u2019s reign the Jews of Poland enjoyed tranquility, toward its close they were subjected to persecution on account of the [[Black Death]]. In 1348, the first [[Blood libel against Jews|blood libel]] accusation against Jews in Poland was recorded, and in 1367 the first pogrom took place in [[Pozna\u0144]] (Posen).<ref name=\"Poznan-1\"/><!-- 2008 {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} edited out --> Compared with the pitiless destruction of their co-religionists in [[Western Europe]], however, the Polish Jews did not fare badly; and the Jewish masses of Germany fled to the more hospitable cities in Poland.\n\n===The early Jagiellon era: 1385\u20131505===\n{{main|History of Poland (1385\u20131569)}}\nAs a result of the marriage of [[Jogaila|Wladislaus II]] (Jagie\u0142\u0142o) to [[Jadwiga of Poland|Jadwiga]], daughter of [[Louis I of Hungary]], Lithuania was [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Union|united with the kingdom of Poland]].

However, religious persecution gradually increased, as the dogmatic clergy pushed for less official tolerance, pressured by the [[Jan Hus#Council of Constance|Synod of Constance]]. In 1349 pogroms took place in many towns in Silesia.<ref name=polishjews.org/> There were accusations of [[blood libel]] by the priests, and new riots against the Jews in Pozna\u0144 in 1399. Accusations of blood libel by another fanatic priest led to the riots in [[Krak\u00f3w]] in 1407, although the royal guard hastened to the rescue.<ref name=\"Dubnow-3\"/> Hysteria caused by Black Death led to additional 14th-century outbreaks of violence against the Jews in [[Kalisz]], Krak\u00f3w and [[Bochnia]]. Traders and artisans jealous of Jewish prosperity, and fearing their rivalry, supported the harassment. In 1423 the statute of Warka forbade Jews the granting of loans against letters of credit or mortgage and limited their operations exclusively to loans made on security of moveable property.<ref name=polishjews.org/> In the 14th and 15th centuries rich Jewish merchants and moneylenders leased the royal mint, salt mines and the collecting of customs and tolls. The most famous of them were Jordan and his son Lewko of Krak\u00f3w in the 14th century and Jakub Slomkowicz of Luck, Wolczko of Drohobycz, Natko of Lvov, Samson of Zydaczow, Josko of Hrubieszow and Szania of Belz in the 15th century. For example, Wolczko of Drohobycz, King Ladislaus Jagiello's broker, was the owner of several villages in the Ruthenian voivodship and the soltys (administrator) of the village of Werbiz. Also Jews from Grodno were in this period owners of villages, manors, meadows, fish ponds and mills. However until the end of the 15th century agriculture as a source of income played only a minor role among Jewish families. More important were crafts for the needs of both their fellow Jews and the Christian population (fur making, tanning, tailoring).<ref name=polishjews.org/>\n[[File:Casimir IV Jagiellon.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Casimir IV Jagiellon]] confirmed and extended Jewish charters in the second half of the 15th century]]\n\nIn 1454 anti-Jewish riots flared up in [[Bohemia]]'s ethnically-German [[Wroc\u0142aw]] and other [[Silesia]]n cities, inspired by a Franciscan friar, [[John of Capistrano]], who accused Jews of profaning the Christian religion. As a result, Jews were banished from Lower Silesia. Zbigniew Olesnicki then invited John to conduct a similar campaign in Krak\u00f3w and several other cities, to lesser effect. In 1495, Jews were ordered out of the center of Krak\u00f3w and allowed to settle in the \"Jewish town\" of Kazimierz.

Indeed, with the expulsion of the [[History of the Jews in Spain|Jews from Spain]], Poland became the recognized haven for exiles from Western Europe; and the resulting accession to the ranks of Polish Jewry made it the cultural and spiritual center of the Jewish people.\n\nThe most prosperous period for Polish Jews began following this new influx of Jews with the reign of [[Sigismund I the Old]] (1506\u20131548), who protected the Jews in his realm. His son, [[Sigismund II Augustus]] (1548\u20131572), mainly followed his father's tolerant policy and also granted communal-administration autonomy to the Jews and laid the foundation for the power of the ''[[Qahal]]'', or autonomous Jewish community. This period led to the creation of a proverb about Poland being a \"heaven for the Jews\". According to some sources, about three-quarters of all Jews lived in Poland by the middle of the 16th century.<ref name=Sanford/><ref name=EJC/><ref name=\"relations\"/> In the middle of the 16th century, Poland welcomed the Jewish newcomers from [[Italy]] and [[Turkey]], mostly of [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]] origin. Jewish religious life thrived in many Polish communities. In 1503, the Polish monarchy appointed Rabbi [[Jacob Pollak]], the official Rabbi of Poland, marking the emergence of the Chief Rabbinate. By 1551, Jews were given permission to choose their own Chief Rabbi. The Chief Rabbinate held power over law and finance, appointing judges and other officials. Some power was shared with local councils. The Polish government permitted the Rabbinate to grow in power, to use it for tax collection purposes. Only 30% of the money raised by the Rabbinate served Jewish causes, the rest went to the Crown for protection. In this period Poland-Lithuania became the main center for Ashkenazi Jewry and its ''[[yeshiva|yeshivot]]'' achieved fame from the early 16th century.\n\n[[Moses Isserles]] (1520\u20131572), an eminent [[Talmud]]ist of the 16th century, established his [[yeshiva]] in [[Krak\u00f3w]]. In addition to being a renowned Talmudic and [[halakha|legal scholar]], Isserles was also learned in [[Kabbalah]], and studied history, astronomy, and philosophy. The [[Remuh Synagogue]] was built for him in 1557.

The Jewish community suffered greatly during the 1648 Cossack uprising which had been directed primarily against the Polish nobility. The Jews, perceived as allies of the nobles, were also victims of the revolt, during which about 20% of them were killed.\n\n[[File:Neu-er\u00f6ffnete Welt-Galleria Polnischer Jude.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A Polish Jew in an engraving from 1703]]\n\nRuled by the elected kings of the [[House of Vasa]] since 1587, the embattled Commonwealth was invaded by the [[Swedish Empire]] in 1655 in what became known as [[Deluge (history)|the Deluge]].

[[Charles X of Sweden]], at the head of his victorious army, overran the cities of Krak\u00f3w and Warsaw. The amount of destruction, pillage and methodical plunder during the [[Siege of Krak\u00f3w (1657)]] was so enormous that parts the city never again recovered.

Poland continued to be the spiritual center of Judaism. Through 1698, the Polish kings generally remained supportive of the Jews. Although Jewish losses in those events were high, estimated by some historians to be close to 500,000, {{Fact?|date=July 2018}} the Commonwealth lost one third of its population \u2014 approximately three million of its citizens.\n\nThe environment of the Polish Commonwealth, according to Hundert, profoundly affected Jews due to genuinely positive encounter with the Christian culture across the many cities and towns owned by the Polish aristocracy. There was no isolation.{{sfn|Hundert|2004|pp=51\u201352}} The Jewish dress resembled that of their Polish neighbor. \"Reports of romances, of drinking together in taverns, and of intellectual conversations are quite abundant.\" Wealthy Jews had Polish noblemen at their table, and served meals on silver plates.{{sfn|Hundert|2004|pp=51\u201352}} By 1764, there were about 750,000 Jews in the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]].

Some Jewish historians have recounted that the word Poland is pronounced as ''Polania'' or ''Polin'' in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], and as [[transliteration|transliterated]] into Hebrew, these names for Poland were interpreted as \"good omens\" because ''Polania'' can be broken down into three Hebrew words: ''po'' (\"here\"), ''lan'' (\"dwells\"), ''ya'' (\"[[Names of God in Judaism|God]]\"), and ''Polin'' into two words of: ''po'' (\"here\") ''lin'' (\"[you should] dwell\"). The \"message\" was that Poland was meant to be a good place for the Jews. During the time from the rule of [[Sigismund I the Old]] until the Nazi [[Holocaust]], Poland would be at the center of Jewish religious life. Many agreed with Rabbi [[David HaLevi Segal|David ben Shemu\u2019el ha-Levi]] (Taz) that Poland was a place where \"most of the time the gentiles do no harm; on the contrary they do right by Israel\" (''Divre David;'' 1689).<ref>[[David HaLevi Segal|David ben Samuel Ha-Levi]], \"Divre \u0304 David Ture \u0304 Zahav\" (1689) in Hebrew.

Quoted by the YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe.</ref>\n\n===Jewish learning===\n[[File:Synagoga Zamo\u015b\u0107 VIII 2010.jpg|thumb|Late-[[Renaissance]] [[Zamo\u015b\u0107 Synagogue|synagogue]], [[Zamo\u015b\u0107]], Poland, 1610\u201320]]\n''[[Yeshiva|Yeshivot]]'' were established, under the direction of the rabbis, in the more prominent communities. Such schools were officially known as [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasiums]], and their rabbi principals as [[Rector (academia)|rectors]]. Important ''yeshivot'' existed in Krak\u00f3w, Pozna\u0144, and other cities. Jewish printing establishments came into existence in the first quarter of the 16th century. In 1530 a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[Pentateuch]] ([[Torah]]) was printed in Krak\u00f3w; and at the end of the century the Jewish printing houses of that city and [[Lublin]] issued a large number of Jewish books, mainly of a religious character. The growth of [[Talmud|Talmudic scholarship]] in Poland was coincident with the greater prosperity of the Polish Jews; and because of their communal autonomy educational development was wholly one-sided and along Talmudic lines. Exceptions are recorded, however, where Jewish youth sought secular instruction in the European universities. The learned rabbis became not merely expounders of the Law, but also spiritual advisers, teachers, judges, and legislators; and their authority compelled the communal leaders to make themselves familiar with the abstruse questions of [[Halakha|Jewish law]]. Polish Jewry found its views of life shaped by the spirit of Talmudic and rabbinical literature, whose influence was felt in the home, in school, and in the synagogue.\n\nIn the first half of the 16th century the seeds of Talmudic learning had been transplanted to Poland from [[Bohemia]], particularly from the school of [[Jacob Pollak]], the creator of ''[[Pilpul]]'' (\"sharp reasoning\"). [[Shalom Shachna]] (c. 1500\u20131558), a pupil of Pollak, is counted among the pioneers of Talmudic learning in Poland. He lived and died in [[Lublin]], where he was the head of the ''yeshivah'' which produced the rabbinical celebrities of the following century. Shachna's son Israel became rabbi of Lublin on the death of his father, and Shachna's pupil [[Moses Isserles]] (known as the ''ReMA'') (1520\u20131572) achieved an international reputation among the Jews as the co-author of the ''[[Shulkhan Arukh]]'', (the \"Code of Jewish Law\"). His contemporary and correspondent [[Solomon Luria]] (1510\u20131573) of Lublin also enjoyed a wide reputation among his co-religionists; and the authority of both was recognized by the Jews throughout Europe. Heated religious disputations were common, and Jewish scholars participated in them. At the same time, the ''[[Kabbalah]]'' had become entrenched under the protection of [[Rabbinic Judaism|Rabbinism]]; and such scholars as [[Mordecai Jaffe]] and [[Yoel Sirkis]] devoted themselves to its study. This period of great Rabbinical scholarship was interrupted by the [[Chmielnicki Uprising]] and [[The Deluge (Polish history)|The Deluge]].\n\n===The rise of Hasidism===\n[[File:Jakub Frank.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jacob Frank]]]]\n{{main|Hasidic Judaism}}\nThe decade from the [[Chmielnicki Uprising|Cossacks' uprising]] until after the [[The Deluge (Polish history)|Swedish war]] (1648\u20131658) left a deep and lasting impression not only on the social life of the Polish-Lithuanian Jews, but on their spiritual life as well. The intellectual output of the Jews of Poland was reduced. The Talmudic learning which up to that period had been the common possession of the majority of the people became accessible to a limited number of students only. What religious study there was became overly formalized, some rabbis busied themselves with quibbles concerning religious laws; others wrote commentaries on different parts of the Talmud in which hair-splitting arguments were raised and discussed; and at times these arguments dealt with matters which were of no practical importance. At the same time, many miracle workers made their appearance among the Jews of Poland, culminating in a series of false \"Messianic\" movements, most famously as [[Sabbatai Zevi|Sabbatianism]] was succeeded by [[Jacob Frank|Frankism]].\n\nIn this time of [[mysticism]] and overly formal rabbinism came the teachings of [[Israel ben Eliezer]], known as the ''Baal Shem Tov'', or ''BeShT'', (1698\u20131760), which had a profound effect on the Jews of [[Eastern Europe]] and Poland in particular. His disciples taught and encouraged the new fervent brand of [[Judaism]] based on ''[[Kabbalah]]'' known as [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidism]]. The rise of Hasidic Judaism within Poland's borders and beyond had a great influence on the rise of [[Haredi Judaism]] all over the world, with a continuous influence through its many [[List of Hasidic dynasties|Hasidic dynasties]] including those of [[Chabad-Lubavitch]], [[Aleksander (Hasidic dynasty)|Aleksander]], [[Bobov (Hasidic dynasty)|Bobov]], [[Ger (Hasidic dynasty)|Ger]], [[Nadvorna (Hasidic dynasty)|Nadvorna]], among others.\n\n==The Partitions of Poland==\n[[File:Jewish dress in Poland 17th and 18th century.jpg|thumb|upright|Jewish dress in 17th ''(top)'' and 18th centuries]]\nIn 1742 most of Silesia was lost to [[Prussia]]. Further disorder and anarchy reigned supreme in Poland during the second half of the 18th century, from the accession to the throne of its last king, [[Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski|Stanislaus II Augustus Poniatowski]] in 1764.

The progressive elements in Polish society recognized the urgency of popular education as the very first step toward reform. The famous ''[[Komisja Edukacji Narodowej]]'' (\"Commission of National Education\"), the first ministry of education in the world, was established in 1773 and founded numerous new schools and remodeled the old ones. One of the members of the commission, ''[[kanclerz]]'' [[Andrzej Zamoyski]], along with others, demanded that the inviolability of their persons and property should be guaranteed and that religious toleration should be to a certain extent granted them; but he insisted that Jews living in the cities should be separated from the Christians, that those of them having no definite occupation should be banished from the kingdom, and that even those engaged in agriculture should not be allowed to possess land. On the other hand, some ''szlachta'' and intellectuals proposed a national system of government, of the civil and political equality of the Jews. This was the only example in modern Europe before the [[French Revolution]] of tolerance and broadmindedness in dealing with the Jewish question. But all these reforms were too late: a Russian army soon invaded Poland, and soon after a Prussian one followed.\n[[File:Berek joselewicz.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Berek Joselewicz]] (1764\u20131809)]]\nA second [[Partitions of Poland|partition of Poland]] was made on 17 July 1793. Jews, in a Jewish regiment led by [[Berek Joselewicz]], took part in the [[Ko\u015bciuszko Uprising]] the following year, when the Poles tried to again achieve independence, but were brutally put down. Following the revolt, the third and final partition of Poland took place in 1795. The territories which included the great bulk of the Jewish population was transferred to Russia, and thus they became subjects of that empire, although in the first half of the 19th century some semblance of a vastly smaller Polish state was preserved, especially in the form of the [[Congress Poland]] (1815\u20131831).\n\nUnder foreign rule many Jews inhabiting formerly Polish lands were indifferent to Polish aspirations for independence.

By the late 19th century, over four million Jews would live in the Pale.\n\nTsarist policy towards the Jews of Poland alternated between harsh rules, and inducements meant to break the resistance to large-scale conversion.

The Polish Jews were allowed to establish schools with Russian, German or Polish curricula. They could own land in the territories annexed from Poland. However, they were also restricted from leasing property, teaching in Yiddish, and from entering Russia. They were banned from the [[brewing industry]]. The harshest measures designed to compel Jews to merge into society at large called for their expulsion from small villages, forcing them to move into towns. Once the resettlement began, thousands of Jews lost their only source of income and turned to [[Qahal]] for support.

It extended from the eastern ''pale'', or demarcation line, to the western Russian border with the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] (later the [[German Empire]]) and with [[Austria-Hungary]].\nThe archaic English term ''pale'' is derived from the [[Latin]] word {{lang|la|[[:wikt:palus#Latin|palus]]}}, a stake, extended to mean the area enclosed by a fence or boundary.\n\nWith its large Catholic and Jewish populations, the Pale was acquired by the Russian Empire (which was a majority [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]]) in a series of military conquests and diplomatic maneuvers between 1791 and 1835, and lasted until the fall of the Russian Empire in 1917. It comprised about 20% of the territory of European Russia and mostly corresponded to historical borders of the former [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]]; it covered much of present-day [[Lithuania]], [[Belarus]], [[Poland]], [[Moldova]], [[Ukraine]], and parts of western [[Russia]].\n\nFrom 1791 to 1835, and until 1917, there were differing reconfigurations of the boundaries of the Pale, such that certain areas were variously open or shut to Jewish residency, such as the [[Caucasus]]. At times, Jews were forbidden to live in agricultural communities, or certain cities, as in [[Kiev]], [[Sevastopol]] and [[Yalta]], excluded from residency at a number of cities within the Pale. Settlers from  outside the pale were forced to move to small towns, thus fostering the rise of the ''[[shtetl]]s''.\n\nAlthough the Jews were accorded slightly more rights with the [[Emancipation reform of 1861]] by [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]], they were still restricted to the [[Pale of Settlement]] and subject to restrictions on ownership and profession. The existing [[status quo]] was shattered with the [[Alexander II of Russia#Assassination|assassination of Alexander]] in 1881 \u2013 an act falsely blamed upon the Jews.\n\n===Pogroms in the Russian Empire===\n[[File:Pogrom bialystok.jpg|thumb|upright|Caricature of [[Russian Army]] assailant in 1906 [[Bia\u0142ystok pogrom]]]]\nThe assassination prompted a large-scale wave of anti-Jewish riots, called ''[[pogroms]]'' ({{lang-ru|\u043f\u043e\u0433\u0440\u043e\u0301\u043c}};) throughout 1881\u20131884.

Pogroms continued until 1884, with at least tacit government approval. They proved a turning point in the history of the Jews in [[partitioned Poland]] and throughout the world. In 1884, 36 Jewish [[Zionism|Zionist]] delegates [[Katowice Conference|met in Katowice]], forming the [[Hovevei Zion]] movement. The pogroms prompted a great wave of Jewish emigration to the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Russia/Russian_Empire|title=Russian Empire|last=Stanislawski|first=Michael|website=YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe}}</ref>\n\nAn even bloodier wave of pogroms broke out from 1903 to 1906, at least some of them believed to have been organized by the Tsarist Russian secret police, the ''[[Okhrana]]''. They included the [[Bia\u0142ystok pogrom]] of 1906 in the [[Grodno Governorate]] of Russian Poland, in which at least 75 Jews were murdered by marauding soldiers and many more Jews were wounded.

Champions of ''Haskalah'', the ''[[Haskalah|Maskilim]]'', pushed for assimilation and integration into Russian culture. At the same time, there was another school of Jewish thought that emphasized traditional study and a Jewish response to the ethical problems of antisemitism and persecution, one form of which was the [[Musar movement]]. Polish Jews generally were less influenced by ''Haskalah'', rather focusing on a strong continuation of their religious lives based on [[Halakha]] (\"rabbis's law\") following primarily [[Orthodox Judaism]], [[Hasidic Judaism]], and also adapting to the new [[Religious Zionism]] of the [[Mizrachi (Religious Zionism)|Mizrachi]] movement later in the 19th century.\n\n===Politics in Polish territory===\n[[File:ac.manif1917.jpg|thumb|A [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|Bund]]ist demonstration, 1917]]\nBy the late 19th century, ''Haskalah'' and the debates it caused created a growing number of political movements within the Jewish community itself, covering a wide range of views and vying for votes in local and regional elections. Zionism became very popular with the advent of the ''[[Poale Zion]]'' socialist party as well as the religious [[Polish Mizrahi]], and the increasingly popular [[General Zionists]]. Jews also took up [[socialism]], forming the [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|Bund]] [[labor union]] which supported assimilation and the [[rights of labor]]. The [[Folkspartei]] (People's Party) advocated, for its part, cultural autonomy and resistance to assimilation. In 1912, ''[[Agudat Israel]]'', a religious party, came into existence.\n\nMany Jews took part in the Polish insurrections, particularly against Russia (since the Tsars discriminated heavily against the Jews). The [[Ko\u015bciuszko Insurrection]] (1794), [[November Insurrection]] (1830\u201331), [[January Insurrection]] (1863) and [[Russian Revolution of 1905|Revolutionary Movement of 1905]] all saw significant Jewish involvement in the cause of Polish independence.\n\nDuring the [[Second Polish Republic]] period, there were several prominent Jewish politicians in the Polish Sejm, such as [[Apolinary Hartglas]] and [[Yitzhak Gruenbaum]]. Many Jewish political parties were active, representing a wide ideological spectrum, from the Zionists, to the socialists to the anti-Zionists. One of the largest of these parties was the Bund, which was strongest in Warsaw and Lodz.\n\nIn addition to the socialists, Zionist parties were also popular, in particular, the Marxist [[Poale Zion]] and the orthodox religious Polish Mizrahi. The [[General Zionists|General Zionist]] party became the most prominent Jewish party in the interwar period and in the 1919 elections to the [[Polish legislative election, 1919|first Polish Sejm]] since the partitions, gained 50% of the Jewish vote.\n\nIn 1914, the German Zionist [[Max Bodenheimer]] founded the short-lived [[German Committee for Freeing of Russian Jews]], with the goal of establishing a buffer state (''Pufferstaat'') within the Jewish Pale of Settlement, composed of the [[Partitions of Poland|former Polish provinces annexed by Russia]], being ''de facto'' [[protectorate]] of the [[German Empire]] that would free Jews in the region from Russian oppression. The plan, known as the [[League of East European States]], soon proved unpopular with both German officials and Bodenheimer's colleagues, and was dead by the following year.<ref>[[Walter Laqueur]].

Jewish political parties, both the [[Socialist]] [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Poland|General Jewish Labour Bund]] (The Bund), as well as parties of the Zionist right and left wing and religious conservative movements, were represented in the ''[[Sejm]]'' (the Polish Parliament) as well as in the regional councils.<ref>Yad Vashem, [https://web.archive.org/web/20090720013543/http://www1.yadvashem.org/Odot/prog/image_into.asp?id=7694&lang=EN&type_id=&addr=%2FIMAGE_TYPE%2F7694.JPG  The Bund Council in August 1937, Warsaw, Poland.] Film and Photo Archive.</ref>\n[[File:Isaac Bashevis Singer (upright).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Isaac Bashevis Singer]] (Polish: Izaak Zynger), achieved international acclaim as a classic Jewish writer and was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1978]]\n\nThe Jewish cultural scene <ref>Aleksander Hertz, Lucjan Dobroszycki [https://books.google.com/books?id=APRYwrQWy-AC&dq=jews+in+polish+culture&printsec=frontcover The Jews in Polish culture], Northwestern University Press, 1988 {{ISBN|0-8101-0758-9}}</ref> was particularly vibrant in pre\u2013World War II Poland, with numerous Jewish publications and more than one hundred periodicals. Yiddish authors, most notably [[Isaac Bashevis Singer]], went on to achieve international acclaim as classic Jewish writers; Singer won the 1978 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. His brother [[Israel Joshua Singer]] was also a writer. Other Jewish authors of the period, such as [[Bruno Schulz]], [[Julian Tuwim]], [[Marian Hemar]], [[Emanuel Schlechter]] and [[Boles\u0142aw Le\u015bmian]], as well as [[Konrad Tom]] and [[Jerzy Jurandot]], were less well known internationally, but made important contributions to Polish literature. Some Polish writers had Jewish roots e.g. [[Jan Brzechwa]] (a favorite poet of Polish children). Singer [[Jan Kiepura]], born of a Jewish mother and Polish father, was one of the most popular artists of that era, and pre-war songs of Jewish composers, including [[Henryk Wars]], [[Jerzy Petersburski]], [[Artur Gold]], [[Henryk Gold]], [[Zygmunt Bia\u0142ostocki]], [[Szymon Kataszek]] and [[Jakub Kagan]], are still widely known in Poland today. Painters became known as well for their depictions of Jewish life. Among them were [[Maurycy Gottlieb]], [[Artur Markowicz]], and [[Maurycy Trebacz]], with younger artists like [[Chaim Goldberg]] coming up in the ranks.\n\nMany Jews were film producers and directors, e.g. [[Micha\u0142 Waszy\u0144ski]] (''[[The Dybbuk (film)|The Dybbuk)]]'', [[Aleksander Ford]] (''[[Children Must Laugh]]'').\n\n[[File:Shimon Peres, Yasser Arafat - World Economic Forum Annual Meeting Davos 2001.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Shimon Peres]], born in Poland as Szymon Perski,  served as the ninth [[President of Israel]] between 2007 and 2014]]\n\nScientist [[Leopold Infeld]], mathematician [[Stanislaw Ulam]], [[Alfred Tarski]], and professor [[Adam Ulam]] contributed to the world of science. Other Polish Jews who gained international recognition are [[Moses Schorr]], [[Ludwik Zamenhof]] (the creator of [[Esperanto]]), [[Georges Charpak]], [[Samuel Eilenberg]], [[Emanuel Ringelblum]], and [[Artur Rubinstein]], just to name a few from the long list. The term \"[[genocide]]\" was coined by [[Rafa\u0142 Lemkin]] (1900\u20131959), a Polish-Jewish legal scholar. [[Leonid Hurwicz]] was awarded the 2007 [[Nobel Prize in Economics]]. The [[YIVO]] (Jidiszer Wissenszaftlecher Institute) Scientific Institute was based in Wilno before transferring to New York during the war. In Warsaw, important centers of Judaic scholarship, such the [[Main Judaic Library]] and the Institute of Judaic Studies were located, along with numerous Talmudic Schools (Jeszybots), religious centers and synagogues, many of which were of high architectural quality. [[Yiddish theatre]] also flourished; Poland had fifteen Yiddish theatres and theatrical groups. Warsaw was home to the most important Yiddish theater troupe of the time, the [[Vilna Troupe]], which staged the first performance of ''[[The Dybbuk]]'' in 1920 at the Elyseum Theatre. Some future Israeli leaders studied at [[University of Warsaw]], including [[Menachem Begin]] and [[Yitzhak Shamir]].\n\nThere also were several Jewish sports clubs, with some of them, such as [[Hasmonea Lwow]] and [[Jutrzenka Krak\u00f3w]], winning promotion to the [[Ekstraklasa|Polish First Football League]]. A Polish-Jewish footballer, [[J\u00f3zef Klotz]], scored the first ever goal for the [[Poland national football team]]. Another athlete, [[Alojzy Ehrlich]], won several medals in the table-tennis tournaments. Many of these clubs belonged to the [[Maccabi World Union]].{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n===Between antisemitism and support for Zionism and Jewish state in Palestine===\nAn ever-increasing proportion of Jews in [[Second Polish Republic|interwar Poland]] lived separate lives from the Polish majority.

Some scholars note that while not pro-Communist, many Jews saw the Soviets as the lesser threat compared to the German Nazis. They stress that stories of Jews welcoming the Soviets on the streets, vividly remembered by many Poles from the [[Kresy|eastern part of the country]] are impressionistic and not reliable indicators of the level of Jewish support for the Soviets. Additionally, it has been noted that some ethnic Poles were as prominent as Jews in filling civil and police positions in the occupation administration, and that Jews, both civilians and in the Polish military, suffered equally at the hands of the Soviet occupiers.<ref>Samuel D.

A larger number of younger Jews, often through the pro-Marxist Bund or some Zionist groups, were sympathetic to [[Communism]] and Soviet Russia, both of which had been enemies of the [[Polish Second Republic]]. As a result of these factors they found it easy after 1939 to participate in the Soviet occupation administration in Eastern Poland, and briefly occupied prominent positions in industry, schools, local government, police and other Soviet-installed institutions.

However, the size of the Ghetto was only about 2.4% of the size of the city. The Germans closed off the Ghetto from the outside world, building a wall around it by 16 November 1940. During the next year and a half, Jews from smaller cities and villages were brought into the Warsaw Ghetto, while diseases (especially [[typhoid]]) and starvation kept the inhabitants at about the same number. Average food rations in 1941 for Jews in Warsaw were limited to 253 kcal, and 669 kcal for Poles, as opposed to 2,613 kcal for Germans.

About 50 ghetto fighters were saved by the Polish \"People's Guard\" and later formed their own partisan group, named after Anielewicz. Even after the end of the uprising there were still several hundreds of Jews who continued living in the ruined ghetto. Many of them survived thanks to the contacts they managed to establish with Poles outside the ghetto. The Uprising inspired Jews throughout Poland. Many Jewish leaders who survived the liquidation continued underground work outside the ghetto.

About 50,000 Jews from the city and the surrounding region were confined in a small area of Bia\u0142ystok. The ghetto had two sections, divided by the [[Bia\u0142a River (Supra\u015bl basin)|Biala River]]. Most Jews in the Bia\u0142ystok ghetto worked in forced-labor projects, primarily in large textile factories located within the ghetto boundaries. The Germans also sometimes used Jews in forced-labor projects outside the ghetto.\n\nIn February 1943, approximately 10,000 Bia\u0142ystok Jews were deported to the [[Treblinka extermination camp]]. During the deportations, hundreds of Jews, mainly those deemed too weak or sick to travel, were killed.\n\nIn August 1943, the Germans mounted an operation to destroy the Bia\u0142ystok ghetto. German forces and local police auxiliaries surrounded the ghetto and began to round up Jews systematically for deportation to the Treblinka extermination camp. Approximately 7,600 Jews were held in a central transit camp in the city before deportation to Treblinka. Those deemed fit to work were sent to the [[Majdanek]] camp. In Majdanek, after another screening for ability to work, they were transported to the Poniatowa, Blizyn, or Auschwitz camps. Those deemed too weak to work were murdered at Majdanek. More than 1,000 Jewish children were sent first to the [[Theresienstadt concentration camp|Theresienstadt]] ghetto in [[Bohemia]], and then to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz-Birkenau]], where they were killed.\n\nOn 15 August 1943, the [[Bia\u0142ystok Ghetto Uprising]] began, and several hundred Polish Jews and members of the [[Anti-Fascist Military Organisation]] ({{lang-pl|Antyfaszystowska Organizacja Bojowa}}) started an armed struggle against the German troops who were carrying out the planned liquidation and deportation of the ghetto to the [[Treblinka extermination camp]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Ruch oporu w getcie bia\u0142ostockim.

At the same time there was an ongoing power struggle within the party itself and the antisemitic campaign was used by one faction against another. The so-called \"Partisan\" faction blamed the Jews who had held office during the Stalinist period for the excesses that had occurred, but the end result was that most of the remaining Polish Jews, regardless of their background or political affiliation, were targeted by the communist authorities.<ref>AP Online, \"Some Jewish exiles to have Polish citizenship restored this week\", 3 October 1998, [https://web.archive.org/web/20110812044919/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-19804342.html]</ref>\n\nThere were several outcomes of the ''[[March 1968 events]]''.

Many historical issues, especially related to World War II and the 1944\u201389 period, suppressed by Communist censorship, have been re-evaluated and publicly discussed (like the Jedwabne pogrom, the [[Koniuchy massacre]], the [[Kielce pogrom]], the [[Auschwitz cross]], and Polish-Jewish wartime relations in general).\n[[File:Rabin Polski.jpg|thumb|upright|Chief Rabbi of Poland \u2013 [[Michael Schudrich]]]]\n\n[[File:Synagoga lesko.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lesko Synagogue]], Poland]]\n[[File:Beit Warszawa synagogue interior2006.jpg|thumb|left|Reform [[Beit Warszawa Synagogue]]]]\n\nJewish religious life has been revived with the help of the [[Ronald Lauder Foundation]] and the [[Taube Foundation for Jewish Life & Culture]]. There are two rabbis serving the Polish Jewish community, several Jewish schools and associated summer camps as well as several periodical and book series sponsored by the above foundations. Jewish studies programs are offered at major universities, such as [[Warsaw University]] and the [[Jagiellonian University]]. The [[Union of Jewish Religious Communities in Poland]] was founded in 1993. Its purpose is the promotion and organization of Jewish religious and cultural activities in Polish communities.\n\nA large number of cities with synagogues include Warsaw, Krak\u00f3w, [[Zamo\u015b\u0107]], [[Tykocin]], [[Rzesz\u00f3w]], [[Kielce]], or [[G\u00f3ra Kalwaria]] although not many of them are still active in their original religious role. Stara Synagoga (\"Old Synagogue\") in Krak\u00f3w, which hosts a Jewish museum, was built in the early 15th century and is the oldest synagogue in Poland. Before the war, the Yeshiva Chachmei in Lublin was Europe's largest. In 2007 it was renovated, dedicated and reopened thanks to the efforts and endowments by Polish Jewry. Warsaw has an active synagogue, [[Beit Warszawa Synagogue|Beit Warszawa]], affiliated with the Liberal-Progressive stream of Judaism.\n\nThere are also several Jewish publications although most of them are in Polish. These include ''[[Midrasz]]'', ''Dos Jidische Wort'' (which is bilingual), as well as a youth journal ''Jidele'' and \"Sztendlach\" for young children. Active institutions include the Jewish Historical Institute, the E.R. Kaminska State Yiddish Theater in Warsaw, and the Jewish Cultural Center. The [[Judaica Foundation]] in Krak\u00f3w has sponsored a wide range of cultural and educational programs on Jewish themes for a predominantly Polish audience. With funds from the city of Warsaw and the Polish government ($26 million total) a [[Museum of the History of Polish Jews]] is being built in Warsaw.

At Treblinka there is a monument built out of many shards of broken stone, as well as a mausoluem dedicated to those who perished there. A small mound of human ashes commemorates the 350,000 victims of the Majdanek camp who were killed there by the Nazis.

It was constructed out of bronze and granite that the Nazis used for a monument honoring German victory over Poland and it was designed by [[Natan Rappaport]]. The Memorial is located where the Warsaw Ghetto used to be, at the site of one command bunker of the [[Jewish Combat Organization]].\n\nA memorial to the victims of the Kielce Pogrom of 1946, where a mob murdered more than 40 Jews who returned to the city after the Holocaust, was unveiled in 2006.
