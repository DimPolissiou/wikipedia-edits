The International Bicycle Trail R2 runs through Elster along the Elbe. A [[reaction ferry]] is still used here for crossing the river. Scenically charming are the ''Elbauen'', which at high water work as natural [[polder]]s. During the so-called [[2006 European floods|Flood of the Century]] in 2006, these natural polders were not high enough to keep the water back, leading to a great deal of the community being flooded.\n\nMoreover, in 2004, a new landing stage was dedicated where Elbe [[cruise ship]]s now stop.\n\n==History==\n\nElster had its first documentary mention in 1187 under the name ''Alstermunde''.

Since 1 January 2011, it is part of the town [[Zahna-Elster]]. From 2005 until 2011 it belonged to the [[Amt (subnational entity)|administrative municipality]] (''Verwaltungsgemeinschaft'') of [[Elbaue-Fl\u00e4ming]], before 2005 it belonged to the administrative community of Elster-Seyda-Kl\u00f6den.\n\n==Geography and transport==\nThe community lies about 15&nbsp;km east of [[Wittenberg]] and 10&nbsp;km west of [[Jessen (Elster)|Jessen]]. Through the community runs the Federal Highway (''Bundesstra\u00dfe'') B&nbsp;187 and the [[railway]] line between Wittenberg and [[Cottbus]].\n\nIt lies at the mouth of the [[Black Elster]], where it empties into the [[Elbe]]. The International Bicycle Trail R2 runs through Elster along the Elbe. A [[reaction ferry]] is still used here for crossing the river. Scenically charming are the ''Elbauen'', which at high water work as natural [[polder]]s. During the so-called [[2006 European floods|Flood of the Century]] in 2006, these natural polders were not high enough to keep the water back, leading to a great deal of the community being flooded.\n\nMoreover, in 2004, a new landing stage was dedicated where Elbe [[cruise ship]]s now stop.\n\n==History==\n\nElster had its first documentary mention in 1187 under the name ''Alstermunde''. Until sometime before the [[Second World War]], it was an important [[shipping]] and [[fishing]] community. Nowadays, the biggest employers are [[agriculture]] and small [[handicraft]] businesses.\n\n==Subdivisions==\nElster consists of Iserbegka, Gielsdorf, Meltendorf, and Elster\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Elster (Elbe)}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20051130231641/http://www.elster-elbe.de/ Elster/Elbe The Community of Elster]\n*[http://www.elbe-elster-tour.de/ Elbe-Elster Tourism Association]\n*[http://www.regionalverein-jessen.de/home.php regionalverein-jessen.de]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n\n[[Category:Villages in Saxony-Anhalt]]\n[[Category:Province of Saxony]]\n[[Category:Bezirk Cottbus]]\n\n\n{{Wittenberg-geo-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elster_(Elbe)"}
