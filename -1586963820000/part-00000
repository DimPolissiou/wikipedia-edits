This mode finds players teaming up with a friend and taking on the CPU or two human opponents.\n\n===Presentation===\nOn the next-generation systems former NFL [[running back]] and ''[[Madden NFL 2003]]'' cover athlete [[Marshall Faulk]] hosts a segment called ''Marshall's Minute'' in which he discusses key star players and predicts the score prior to the game.<ref name=\"ign1\" /> ''Weapons'' (see below) also get special introductions before games.<ref name=\"ign1\" /> Also on next-generation systems, the game features an intro composed by [[David Robidoux]] titled, \"Who Wants It More?\", after the [[Super Bowl XLII]] slogan.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.apmmusic.com/r-v/david-robidoux |title=David Robidoux |work=[[APM Music]] |accessdate=November 28, 2012}}</ref>\n\n \nThe soundtrack for ''Madden NFL 08''  featured [[EA Trax]], which included [[The Used]], [[Atreyu]], [[Mims (rapper)|Mims]], [[Swizz Beatz]], and many more hip hop/rock artists.\n\n==Features==\n\n===Weapons===\nCertain star players are deemed to have \"weapons\" which can enhance their performances and create game-changing plays.<ref name=\"ign\">{{cite web |last=Robinson |first=Jon |date=May 18, 2007 |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/05/18/five-things-you-need-to-know-about-madden-08 |title=Five Things You Need to Know About Madden 08 |website=IGN |accessdate=May 26, 2015}}</ref> For example, players with the \"Smart Quarterback\" weapon are able to read defensive schemes and [[Quarterback#Special tactics|audible]] accordingly. Possession receivers can make tough catches over the middle, Shutdown corners can stay on even the toughest receivers, and Spectacular Catch receivers are able to leap over defenders and make difficult grabs.\n\nAnother added feature is to change players' positions to utilize their individual talents more effectively, such as [[Devin Hester]] (who can be converted from [[cornerback]] to [[wide receiver]]) and [[Brandon Marshall]] (who can be converted from wide receiver to tight end). It is also possible to move around offensive and defensive linemen with little effect to their overall rating. However, on the PlayStation 3 version of the game, player positions are locked and cannot be changed.\n\nThe weapons feature can be turned on or off in the game settings.\n\n===Superstar Mode additions===\nWith the addition of the ''Campus Legend'' mode to the next-gen version of ''[[NCAA Football 08]]'', players are now able to take their player from Campus Legend mode and import him into ''Madden'''s ''Superstar Mode''. In addition, players are able to create a player, take over the careers of select rookies from the [[2007 NFL Draft]] and use them in Superstar Mode.<ref name=\"ign\" /> Also, the superstar's team can be chosen by the user based on what the menu-set \"Favorite Team\" is. Camera angles have also been tweaked for the next gen of ''Madden 08'' after complaints with its predecessor.<ref name=\"ign\" /> Key attributes of superstars are assigned by players when creating them, rather than generated by random parents.<ref name=\"GSpot\">{{cite web |last=Navarro |first=Alex |date=August 20, 2007 |url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/madden-nfl-08-review/1900-6176958/ |title=Madden NFL 08 Review (GC, PS2, Xbox) |website=GameSpot |accessdate=May 26, 2015}}</ref> A number of features have been left out in this year's Wii version, most notably, the ability to edit the game player's superstars appearance as the Superstar Mirror is no longer selectable, and the Barber Shop in the City Map is also no longer selectable. Users are stuck with the random hair combination given to the user while registering their new superstar. Although certain new features have been added as well. For example, a player can have more control over their character while firing agents, while the selection of rookies is more extensive, although it is not available for [[Nintendo DS]].\n\n===Player attributes===\nFor the first time, a player can receive an attribute of 100 only for the best players and only for skill positions. [[Devin Hester]] (speed), [[Peyton Manning]] (awareness), [[Tom Brady]] (awareness), [[Champ Bailey]] (man coverage), Reggie Bush (acceleration), [[Lorenzo Neal]] (impact blocking), [[Larry Allen]] (strength), and [[LaDainian Tomlinson]] (juke move and elusiveness) as well as many of the Hall of Fame (HOF) unlockable players, are the only in the game with such skills.<ref>{{cite web |last=Goldstein |first=Hilary |date=August 6, 2007 |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/08/07/madden-08-countdown-player-ratings |title=Madden 08 Countdown: Player Ratings |website=IGN |accessdate=May 26, 2015}}</ref> However, if the player's ratings are accessed, these attributes will drop back to 99.\n\n===Player info===\nThere are certain players such as [[Byron Leftwich]], [[Josh Cribbs]], and [[Vernon Davis]] that are from the [[District of Columbia]] whose home state is blank. If the player moves the state, the blank spot is no longer present.\n\n[[Michael Vick]] is featured in the game as the Atlanta Falcons QB for the last time before his suspension from the NFL in August 2007 for violating its player conduct policy. He was removed in the first roster update.\n\n===Trophy room===\nThe trophy room in ''Madden 08'' is similar to the ''My Shrine'' feature in ''[[NCAA Football 08]]''.<ref name=\"ign1\" /> Trophies can be earned by completing in-game tasks (such as rushing for over 200 yards) or in other game modes (such as winning a Super Bowl in franchise mode).<ref name=\"ign1\" /> Trophies can also be wagered in online head-to-head contests.<ref name=\"ign1\" /> As skill and experience progresses, the user can earn five EA Challenge rings, which have customizable team logos and colors.<ref name=\"ign1\" /> These features have been left out in the Wii version. Once a ring is unlocked, the player is given a code to buy the ring on Jostens.com.\n\n===Fantasy Challenge===\nIn the current-generation version, the game has a Fantasy challenge mode where the player adds players to an NFL team and plays through three different leagues in a single elimination tournament. Other teams can attempt to trade players and challenge the player to competitions to get players from the player's team. If the player plays well enough they reach the top league which has four fictional teams that play in a special way to win. This mode is similar to Blitz: The League's campaign mode.\n\n===Returning features===\nA number of features missing from the first two next-generation versions of ''Madden'' return in ''Madden 08''. These include ''Owner Mode'', fantasy draft, roster-editing, and cooperative play-New, however, to the Xbox 360. There are also mini games like a QB challenge.\n\n===Other features===\nIn addition to the other versions, the Wii version features online gameplay, a ''Madden'' first for a [[Nintendo]] console, as well as the integration of [[Mii]] avatars, and features a few exclusive game modes.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bozon |first1=Mark |last2=Casamassina |first2=Matt |date=June 11, 2007 |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/06/11/madden-nfl-08-wii-interview |title=Madden NFL 08 Wii Interview |website=IGN |accessdate=May 26, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe PlayStation 2, Xbox, and GameCube versions of Madden 08 have a [[Fantasy football (American)|fantasy football]]-type game mode called ''Fantasy Challenge Mode''. In this game mode, players draft the ultimate NFL dream team while advancing through four levels of gameplay.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n| DS = true\n|

This mode finds players teaming up with a friend and taking on the CPU or two human opponents.\n\n===Presentation===\nOn the next-generation systems former NFL [[running back]] and ''[[Madden NFL 2003]]'' cover athlete [[Marshall Faulk]] hosts a segment called ''Marshall's Minute'' in which he discusses key star players and predicts the score prior to the game.<ref name=\"ign1\" /> ''Weapons'' (see below) also get special introductions before games.<ref name=\"ign1\" /> Also on next-generation systems, the game features an intro composed by [[David Robidoux]] titled, \"Who Wants It More?\", after the [[Super Bowl XLII]] slogan.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.apmmusic.com/r-v/david-robidoux |title=David Robidoux |work=[[APM Music]] |accessdate=November 28, 2012}}</ref>\n\n \nThe soundtrack for ''Madden NFL 08''  featured [[EA Trax]], which included [[The Used]], [[Atreyu]], [[Mims (rapper)|Mims]], [[Swizz Beatz]], and many more hip hop/rock artists.\n\n==Features==\n\n===Weapons===\nCertain star players are deemed to have \"weapons\" which can enhance their performances and create game-changing plays.<ref name=\"ign\">{{cite web |last=Robinson |first=Jon |date=May 18, 2007 |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/05/18/five-things-you-need-to-know-about-madden-08 |title=Five Things You Need to Know About Madden 08 |website=IGN |accessdate=May 26, 2015}}</ref> For example, players with the \"Smart Quarterback\" weapon are able to read defensive schemes and [[Quarterback#Special tactics|audible]] accordingly. Possession receivers can make tough catches over the middle, Shutdown corners can stay on even the toughest receivers, and Spectacular Catch receivers are able to leap over defenders and make difficult grabs.\n\nAnother added feature is to change players' positions to utilize their individual talents more effectively, such as [[Devin Hester]] (who can be converted from [[cornerback]] to [[wide receiver]]) and [[Brandon Marshall]] (who can be converted from wide receiver to tight end). It is also possible to move around offensive and defensive linemen with little effect to their overall rating. However, on the PlayStation 3 version of the game, player positions are locked and cannot be changed.\n\nThe weapons feature can be turned on or off in the game settings.\n\n===Superstar Mode additions===\nWith the addition of the ''Campus Legend'' mode to the next-gen version of ''[[NCAA Football 08]]'', players are now able to take their player from Campus Legend mode and import him into ''Madden'''s ''Superstar Mode''. In addition, players are able to create a player, take over the careers of select rookies from the [[2007 NFL Draft]] and use them in Superstar Mode.<ref name=\"ign\" /> Also, the superstar's team can be chosen by the user based on what the menu-set \"Favorite Team\" is. Camera angles have also been tweaked for the next gen of ''Madden 08'' after complaints with its predecessor.<ref name=\"ign\" /> Key attributes of superstars are assigned by players when creating them, rather than generated by random parents.<ref name=\"GSpot\">{{cite web |last=Navarro |first=Alex |date=August 20, 2007 |url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/madden-nfl-08-review/1900-6176958/ |title=Madden NFL 08 Review (GC, PS2, Xbox) |website=GameSpot |accessdate=May 26, 2015}}</ref> A number of features have been left out in this year's Wii version, most notably, the ability to edit the game player's superstars appearance as the Superstar Mirror is no longer selectable, and the Barber Shop in the City Map is also no longer selectable. Users are stuck with the random hair combination given to the user while registering their new superstar. Although certain new features have been added as well. For example, a player can have more control over their character while firing agents, while the selection of rookies is more extensive, although it is not available for [[Nintendo DS]].\n\n===Player attributes===\nFor the first time, a player can receive an attribute of 100 only for the best players and only for skill positions. [[Devin Hester]] (speed), [[Peyton Manning]] (awareness), [[Tom Brady]] (awareness), [[Champ Bailey]] (man coverage), Reggie Bush (acceleration), [[Lorenzo Neal]] (impact blocking), [[Larry Allen]] (strength), and [[LaDainian Tomlinson]] (juke move and elusiveness) as well as many of the Hall of Fame (HOF) unlockable players, are the only in the game with such skills.<ref>{{cite web |last=Goldstein |first=Hilary |date=August 6, 2007 |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/08/07/madden-08-countdown-player-ratings |title=Madden 08 Countdown: Player Ratings |website=IGN |accessdate=May 26, 2015}}</ref> However, if the player's ratings are accessed, these attributes will drop back to 99.\n\n===Player info===\nThere are certain players such as [[Byron Leftwich]], [[Josh Cribbs]], and [[Vernon Davis]] that are from the [[District of Columbia]] whose home state is blank. If the player moves the state, the blank spot is no longer present.\n\n[[Michael Vick]] is featured in the game as the Atlanta Falcons QB for the last time before his suspension from the NFL in August 2007 for violating its player conduct policy. He was removed in the first roster update.\n\n===Trophy room===\nThe trophy room in ''Madden 08'' is similar to the ''My Shrine'' feature in ''[[NCAA Football 08]]''.<ref name=\"ign1\" /> Trophies can be earned by completing in-game tasks (such as rushing for over 200 yards) or in other game modes (such as winning a Super Bowl in franchise mode).<ref name=\"ign1\" /> Trophies can also be wagered in online head-to-head contests.<ref name=\"ign1\" /> As skill and experience progresses, the user can earn five EA Challenge rings, which have customizable team logos and colors.<ref name=\"ign1\" /> These features have been left out in the Wii version. Once a ring is unlocked, the player is given a code to buy the ring on Jostens.com.\n\n===Fantasy Challenge===\nIn the current-generation version, the game has a Fantasy challenge mode where the player adds players to an NFL team and plays through three different leagues in a single elimination tournament. Other teams can attempt to trade players and challenge the player to competitions to get players from the player's team. If the player plays well enough they reach the top league which has four fictional teams that play in a special way to win. This mode is similar to Blitz: The League's campaign mode.\n\n===Returning features===\nA number of features missing from the first two next-generation versions of ''Madden'' return in ''Madden 08''. These include ''Owner Mode'', fantasy draft, roster-editing, and cooperative play-New, however, to the Xbox 360. There are also mini games like a QB challenge.\n\n===Other features===\nIn addition to the other versions, the Wii version features online gameplay, a ''Madden'' first for a [[Nintendo]] console, as well as the integration of [[Mii]] avatars, and features a few exclusive game modes.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bozon |first1=Mark |last2=Casamassina |first2=Matt |date=June 11, 2007 |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/06/11/madden-nfl-08-wii-interview |title=Madden NFL 08 Wii Interview |website=IGN |accessdate=May 26, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe PlayStation 2, Xbox, and GameCube versions of Madden 08 have a [[Fantasy football (American)|fantasy football]]-type game mode called ''Fantasy Challenge Mode''.

{"title_page": "Madzikane", "text_new": "{{short description|King of the Bhaca}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{refimprove|date=January 2016}}\n{{expert subject|date=October 2010}}\n}}\n\n\n\n'''Madzikane''' was the founder and a king of the [[Bhaca]] people. Before him, his father's tribe was known as Abakwa Zelemu but after Madzikane had united many multitudes of different people and different clans, his nation was known as amaBhaca consisting of many clans including: [[Zulu people|amaZulu]], akwaZelemu, amaWushe, amaNqolo, amaNzelu, amaZizi, amaNjilo, abaseNhlwangini, amaQwabe, abaThembu, etc.\n\n==Family==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}\nMadzikane's father was Khalimesh. His firstborn was Crown Prince Sonyangwe followed by Prince Ncapai. However, because of the [[Mfecane]] wars, Sonyangwe the crown prince was burnt to death at night in his hut by traitors from the Memela who were vassals of the [[Bhele|AmaBhele]] of uMdingi who were subjects of King Madzikane while he still reigned. Prince Sonyangwe died at Rode before he could become King of amaBhaca.\n\nTherefore, on the death of King Madzikane, Prince Ncaphayi was crowned King of all amaBhaca but because his elder brother Sonyangwe had left behind two sons in [[Early history of Natal|Natal]], (i.e. Princes Mdutyane and Thiba), King Ncaphayi was obliged to share the throne with Sonyangwes' heir. When Prince Mdutyane was only twenty-one, King Ncaphayi died in a war against the [[Mpondo people|AmaMpondo]] King Faku. Crown Prince Mdutyane was crowned King of all the amaBhaca tribes and hence became the supreme ruler of the whole amaBhaca nation consisting of more than forty-four different tribes scattered all over southern Natal.\n\n===Wives===\nKing Ncapayi had many wives. Indlu Enkulu birth to Diko and Sogoni. From his second wife, Indlu Ykaula,{{clarify|date=December 2015}}. His third wife Iqadi Lendlu Enkulu bore Dabula. King Madzikane's kingdom is currently being revived by the Reat House of Ncapayi, Inkosi Madzikane II Thandisizwe Diko. The home of the Bhacas and the Kingdom is in [[Mount Frere]], KwaBhaca in the Eastern Cape.\n\nNcapayi is said to have been a fearless freebooter, a diplomat of note who showed even more intelligence than his father and was respected by many nations (Soga, p.&nbsp;444)\n\n===Death===\nAccording to Reverend Soga, during the same year in which Ncapayi\u2019s father Madzikane was killed, Ncaphayi entered [[Tembuland]] to avenge his father\u2019s death. The Thembus under King Ngubengcuka made an ineffectual stand and the Bhacas swept away a large number of cattle.<ref name=\"Soga\">(Soga, p.&nbsp;443)</ref>\n\nBefore King Madzikane died, and because of the relationship he had with King Faku, he advised his son to temporarily be a tributary king in [[Pondoland]]. He indeed did that and Faku at this time welcomed the Bhacas as this also coincided with the arrival of Nqetho, a chief of the Qwabes who had moved from Natal running away from King Tshaka\u2019s army because he could not serve under King [[Dingane kaSenzangakhona|Dingane]]. When he entered Pondoland and tried to secure land by violence, Faku was anxious to get rid of him and therefore secured assistance from Ncaphayi to eject Nqetho. amaBhaca drove them back into Natal and Dingane issued instructions to kill Nqetho.<ref name=\"Soga\" />\n\nSoon after Sonyangwe's death King Madzikane died, but before he died he split the Kingdom of the Bhacas between his deceased crown prince and his son Prince Ncaphayi.\n\nThe Thembus defeat by the Bhacas, also led to Faku making an arrangement with Ncapayi when Pondos wanted to attack the Thembus. They entered Thembuland on three successive occasions and each time their raid was a success.\n\nSoga asserts that [[greed|cupidity]] is said to have been the force that brought Faku and Ncapayi to work together. It is also cupidity that is said to have destroyed their good working relationship. Because they were both strong, it  became difficult to know which one was more powerful than the other. Ncapayi attacked Nyanda, the right hand section of the Phondos under Ndamase, the son of [[Faku a Ngqungqushe|Faku]]. He raided Nyanda successfully. Meanwhile, the alarm had been raised with Faku and he Faku assembled a powerful army and this came up with the Bhacas and attacked them on all sides. Faku drove the Bhacas before him onto the kuNowalala Ridge. Ncaphayi was wounded and forced over the edge, falling onto a ledge some distance from the bottom. He was in helpless condition with both arms broken, besides a severe [[assegai]] (spear) wound. He lay there for days, persuading those who came to look at him to put an end to his misery and kill him. No one could do this until Faku gave orders that he must be killed. Madzikane\u2019s son, King Ncapayi died in 1845.\n\n=Ncapai=\n{{Infobox royalty\n| name        = Ncapai ka Madzikane\n| birth_date  = c. 1804\n| birth_place = Bluff (Esibubulungu) now\n[[Durban]] [[Zulu Kingdom]]\n| death_date  = {{death year and age|1846|1804}}\n| death_place = Nowalala, [[Pondoland]] \n| title       = King of [[AmaBhaca]] Kingdom\n| predecessor  = Sonyangwe ka Madzikane\n| successor   = Diko ka Ncapai\n| spouse      = Makhohlisa (senior wife) and several other wives\n\n}}\n\n'''Ncapai''' (also spelt as Ncapayi or Ncaphayi) was the king of the Bhaca people between 1826 until his death in 1846. He was the second son from the first wife of King Madzikane ka Zulu. The first born being Sonyangwe his elder brother. He resided at his father's royal residence in Mpoza great place facing Mganu mountains and also build another residence in the nearby Lutateni. <ref name=\"Soga\">(Soga, p.&nbsp;443)</ref> While trying to attack mpondo people due to Maitland treaty he fell off the cliff  died in a place called Nowalala near Ntabankulu in March 1844.

Between 1837 and 1840, the Bhacas teamed up with the Bushmen and raided the Boers.\n\n==1838==\nIn about February 1838, the Boers settled in the upland of Natal and had successfully set the foundation upon which they could build the [[Natalia Republic|Republic of Natalia]]. After their victories over Dingane, they extended northward to uMfolozi and St. Lucia Bay (Blue Book on Native Affairs, 1885). The Boers had managed to make arrangements with other kings and therefore no longer considered them as potential enemies. For example, they considered King Faku a friendly king and rated Ncapayi a threat as he had a powerful military.\n\nWhen the Boers returned, they decided to attack the [[Bhaca people|Bhacas]] (Bryant, p.&nbsp;400) and raided with 700 men and 50 horses (Nchanga, 119). This is said to have provided the spark for the British intervention in the Bhaca land. (At this time this land had become part of Natal). There is an area near the town of Maclear which is still called Ncapayi land (Kapayi land \u2013 because they could not pronounce \u201cNca\u201d).\n\n==1845==\nBy 1845 the Bhacas had already been stripped of their Kingdom by the  Maitland Treaty. Ncapayi, the first enemy in the Maitland Treaty died and was survived by his first son Diko. But he would be reduced to a headman later on.\n\nINkosi Diko was a hero, a stubborn and a fearless leader of courage. He led the amaBhaca nation for thirty-five years from 1845 to 1880 after the death of his father iKumkani Ncapayi ka Madzikane. INkosi Diko was the grandson of King Madzikane ka Zulu.\n\n==1880==\niNkosi Diko was a fierce leader who fought against the [[annexation]] of the land by the British colonial government. He resisted handing over the AmaBhaca nation so its people could become British subjects. As a result of his resistance to the oppressive rule of the colonisers he was not a favourite of the colonial government of his time. The government decided to overthrow him in 1880. The oppression of Diko\u2019s house had been felt by all eight generations, for a period of 130 years.\n\nAccording to the writings of Anderson Mhlawuli Makaula (1988), by virtue of birth, and according to tradition, Diko was the heir to iKumkani Ncaphayi. But because some of the councillors of AmaBhaca liked Mamjucu, the mother of Makaula, she was fraudulently made a great wife, hence her son attained chieftainship. Makhohlisa (the mother of Diko and Sogoni) who was Ncaphayi\u2019s wife of the great house (uNdlunkulu), was not loved by these councillors, hence they plotted against her.\n\nIt happened that Ncaphayi had killed a man in one of the Mfecane battles and according to AmaBhaca tradition, iNkosi was not supposed to have any contact with his wives until he had undergone some medical treatment. A separate accommodation was to be provided for him. Ncaphayi was then placed in isolation for a stipulated period. The councillors under Qulu Siwela further conspired so that the wife who goes to cook for iNkosi Ncaphayi while he is in isolation, and conceives during that period, would be the one who would give birth to the chief that would succeed him after his death.\n\nThe councillors first went to uNdlunkulu Makhohlisa (Diko and Sogoni\u2019s mother) and deceived her. They told her that she must not dare put her foot in the isolation room where Ncaphayi was sleeping, because this would weaken her sons and cause death by assegai among her children. This sounded reasonable to Makhohlisa. Thereafter the same councillors went to advise Mamjucu (the second wife) to go and cook for iNkosi Ncaphayi in the isolation place. She acted as instructed and her son Makaula was then made iNkosi of AmaBhaca.\n\nSince then, because of this conspiracy of trickery and treachery, the Great House of Ncaphayi has suffered a great deal of disrespect, degradation, and injustice throughout generations that followed.\n\nAfter iNkosi Ncaphayi\u2019s death, Diko (his first and eldest son) led amaBhaca from 1845. iNkosi Diko was always in conflict with the British government and he blatantly refused the annexation of the amaBhaca nation's land. When the British supremacy pervaded the [[Transkei]] Territory during the 1860s, the government pioneered the annexation of the Transkeian Territories. The amakhosi were to give up their power and become subjects of the British Colonial Government. Magistrates were to take over power from the amaKhosi, especially those who refused to submit their nations to be under British rule. iNkosi Diko was one of those traditional leaders who resisted and he was then overthrown, deposed, and made headman by the Colonial Government in 1880.\n\nBattles were fought throughout this period. For example, a friend to iNkosi Diko was iNkosi Mhlontlo of amaMpondomise who is said to have killed a magistrate at [[Qumbu]] while resisting annexation. Other amaKhosi who accepted annexation were rewarded for their loyalty to the colonial government and were looked after and treated well.\n\nThe plan to destroy any trace of iNkosi Diko and his descendants has prevailed over generations after this great hero had died. Even today, Diko\u2019s files, from iNkosi Diko himself, Qoza ka-Diko, Mthakathi ka-Qoza, Mabhijela ka-Mthakathi, Dingumhlaba ka-Mabhijela and Mzawugugi ka-Dingumhlaba (all the descendants of Diko) have been removed from the archives in [[Mthatha]]. The big question is: What happened to these files and where are they?\n                                       \nAmaBhaca are mainly found in the small towns such as Mount Frere, [[Umzimkhulu|uMzimkhulu]], Xopo and some surrounding areas. The isiBhaca language is a mixture of [[Xhosa language|isiXhosa]], [[isiZulu]] and [[Swazi language|isiSwati]]. The language of isiSwati was influenced by the fact that King Madzikane\u2019s mother was from one of the Royal Houses of the Swatis of aMalambo. He grew up within the Swatis from his mother\u2019s side and therefore spoke the language. Although he accepts that he is not an authority on this, Jordan, A.C. (1953) argues and also asserts that in the traditional history of the Bhacas, \u201cuDlamini and kwaDlamini\u201d figure a great deal (P.5). He further states that the Bhaca language was stifled to death chiefly by isiXhasa through, amongst others, schools and churches and that a large number of enlightened Bhacas were taught to look down upon their mother tongue.\n\nDiko is the first son of Ncapayi, (Makhohlisa a daughter of Dzanibe clan was the first wife of Ncapayi) with his younger brother Sogoni from the first wife of Ncaphayi.

Before him, his father's tribe was known as Abakwa Zelemu but after Madzikane had united many multitudes of different people and different clans, his nation was known as amaBhaca consisting of many clans including: [[Zulu people|amaZulu]], akwaZelemu, amaWushe, amaNqolo, amaNzelu, amaZizi, amaNjilo, abaseNhlwangini, amaQwabe, abaThembu, etc.\n\n==Family==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}\nMadzikane's father was Khalimesh. His firstborn was Crown Prince Sonyangwe followed by Prince Ncapai. However, because of the [[Mfecane]] wars, Sonyangwe the crown prince was burnt to death at night in his hut by traitors from the Memela who were vassals of the [[Bhele|AmaBhele]] of uMdingi who were subjects of King Madzikane while he still reigned. Prince Sonyangwe died at Rode before he could become King of amaBhaca.\n\nTherefore, on the death of King Madzikane, Prince Ncaphayi was crowned King of all amaBhaca but because his elder brother Sonyangwe had left behind two sons in [[Early history of Natal|Natal]], (i.e. Princes Mdutyane and Thiba), King Ncaphayi was obliged to share the throne with Sonyangwes' heir. When Prince Mdutyane was only twenty-one, King Ncaphayi died in a war against the [[Mpondo people|AmaMpondo]] King Faku. Crown Prince Mdutyane was crowned King of all the amaBhaca tribes and hence became the supreme ruler of the whole amaBhaca nation consisting of more than forty-four different tribes scattered all over southern Natal.\n\n===Wives===\nKing Ncapayi had many wives. Indlu Enkulu birth to Diko and Sogoni. From his second wife, Indlu Ykaula,{{clarify|date=December 2015}}. His third wife Iqadi Lendlu Enkulu bore Dabula. King Madzikane's kingdom is currently being revived by the Reat House of Ncapayi, Inkosi Madzikane II Thandisizwe Diko. The home of the Bhacas and the Kingdom is in [[Mount Frere]], KwaBhaca in the Eastern Cape.\n\nNcapayi is said to have been a fearless freebooter, a diplomat of note who showed even more intelligence than his father and was respected by many nations (Soga, p.&nbsp;444)\n\n===Death===\nAccording to Reverend Soga, during the same year in which Ncapayi\u2019s father Madzikane was killed, Ncaphayi entered [[Tembuland]] to avenge his father\u2019s death. The Thembus under King Ngubengcuka made an ineffectual stand and the Bhacas swept away a large number of cattle.<ref name=\"Soga\">(Soga, p.&nbsp;443)</ref>\n\nBefore King Madzikane died, and because of the relationship he had with King Faku, he advised his son to temporarily be a tributary king in [[Pondoland]]. He indeed did that and Faku at this time welcomed the Bhacas as this also coincided with the arrival of Nqetho, a chief of the Qwabes who had moved from Natal running away from King Tshaka\u2019s army because he could not serve under King [[Dingane kaSenzangakhona|Dingane]]. When he entered Pondoland and tried to secure land by violence, Faku was anxious to get rid of him and therefore secured assistance from Ncaphayi to eject Nqetho. amaBhaca drove them back into Natal and Dingane issued instructions to kill Nqetho.<ref name=\"Soga\" />\n\nSoon after Sonyangwe's death King Madzikane died, but before he died he split the Kingdom of the Bhacas between his deceased crown prince and his son Prince Ncaphayi.\n\nThe Thembus defeat by the Bhacas, also led to Faku making an arrangement with Ncapayi when Pondos wanted to attack the Thembus. They entered Thembuland on three successive occasions and each time their raid was a success.\n\nSoga asserts that [[greed|cupidity]] is said to have been the force that brought Faku and Ncapayi to work together. It is also cupidity that is said to have destroyed their good working relationship. Because they were both strong, it  became difficult to know which one was more powerful than the other. Ncapayi attacked Nyanda, the right hand section of the Phondos under Ndamase, the son of [[Faku a Ngqungqushe|Faku]]. He raided Nyanda successfully. Meanwhile, the alarm had been raised with Faku and he Faku assembled a powerful army and this came up with the Bhacas and attacked them on all sides. Faku drove the Bhacas before him onto the kuNowalala Ridge. Ncaphayi was wounded and forced over the edge, falling onto a ledge some distance from the bottom. He was in helpless condition with both arms broken, besides a severe [[assegai]] (spear) wound. He lay there for days, persuading those who came to look at him to put an end to his misery and kill him. No one could do this until Faku gave orders that he must be killed. Madzikane\u2019s son, King Ncapayi died in 1845.\n\n=Ncapai=\n{{Infobox royalty\n| name        = Ncapai ka Madzikane\n| birth_date  = c. 1804\n| birth_place = Bluff (Esibubulungu) now\n[[Durban]] [[Zulu Kingdom]]\n| death_date  = {{death year and age|1846|1804}}\n| death_place = Nowalala, [[Pondoland]] \n| title       = King of [[AmaBhaca]] Kingdom\n| predecessor  = Sonyangwe ka Madzikane\n| successor   = Diko ka Ncapai\n| spouse      = Makhohlisa (senior wife) and several other wives\n\n}}\n\n'''Ncapai''' (also spelt as Ncapayi or Ncaphayi) was the king of the Bhaca people between 1826 until his death in 1846.

Between 1837 and 1840, the Bhacas teamed up with the Bushmen and raided the Boers.\n\n==1838==\nIn about February 1838, the Boers settled in the upland of Natal and had successfully set the foundation upon which they could build the [[Natalia Republic|Republic of Natalia]]. After their victories over Dingane, they extended northward to uMfolozi and St. Lucia Bay (Blue Book on Native Affairs, 1885). The Boers had managed to make arrangements with other kings and therefore no longer considered them as potential enemies. For example, they considered King Faku a friendly king and rated Ncapayi a threat as he had a powerful military.\n\nWhen the Boers returned, they decided to attack the [[Bhaca people|Bhacas]] (Bryant, p.&nbsp;400) and raided with 700 men and 50 horses (Nchanga, 119). This is said to have provided the spark for the British intervention in the Bhaca land. (At this time this land had become part of Natal). There is an area near the town of Maclear which is still called Ncapayi land (Kapayi land \u2013 because they could not pronounce \u201cNca\u201d).\n\n==1845==\nBy 1845 the Bhacas had already been stripped of their Kingdom by the  Maitland Treaty. Ncapayi, the first enemy in the Maitland Treaty died and was survived by his first son Diko. But he would be reduced to a headman later on.\n\nINkosi Diko was a hero, a stubborn and a fearless leader of courage. He led the amaBhaca nation for thirty-five years from 1845 to 1880 after the death of his father iKumkani Ncapayi ka Madzikane. INkosi Diko was the grandson of King Madzikane ka Zulu.\n\n==1880==\niNkosi Diko was a fierce leader who fought against the [[annexation]] of the land by the British colonial government. He resisted handing over the AmaBhaca nation so its people could become British subjects. As a result of his resistance to the oppressive rule of the colonisers he was not a favourite of the colonial government of his time. The government decided to overthrow him in 1880. The oppression of Diko\u2019s house had been felt by all eight generations, for a period of 130 years.\n\nAccording to the writings of Anderson Mhlawuli Makaula (1988), by virtue of birth, and according to tradition, Diko was the heir to iKumkani Ncaphayi. But because some of the councillors of AmaBhaca liked Mamjucu, the mother of Makaula, she was fraudulently made a great wife, hence her son attained chieftainship. Makhohlisa (the mother of Diko and Sogoni) who was Ncaphayi\u2019s wife of the great house (uNdlunkulu), was not loved by these councillors, hence they plotted against her.\n\nIt happened that Ncaphayi had killed a man in one of the Mfecane battles and according to AmaBhaca tradition, iNkosi was not supposed to have any contact with his wives until he had undergone some medical treatment. A separate accommodation was to be provided for him. Ncaphayi was then placed in isolation for a stipulated period. The councillors under Qulu Siwela further conspired so that the wife who goes to cook for iNkosi Ncaphayi while he is in isolation, and conceives during that period, would be the one who would give birth to the chief that would succeed him after his death.\n\nThe councillors first went to uNdlunkulu Makhohlisa (Diko and Sogoni\u2019s mother) and deceived her. They told her that she must not dare put her foot in the isolation room where Ncaphayi was sleeping, because this would weaken her sons and cause death by assegai among her children. This sounded reasonable to Makhohlisa. Thereafter the same councillors went to advise Mamjucu (the second wife) to go and cook for iNkosi Ncaphayi in the isolation place. She acted as instructed and her son Makaula was then made iNkosi of AmaBhaca.\n\nSince then, because of this conspiracy of trickery and treachery, the Great House of Ncaphayi has suffered a great deal of disrespect, degradation, and injustice throughout generations that followed.\n\nAfter iNkosi Ncaphayi\u2019s death, Diko (his first and eldest son) led amaBhaca from 1845. iNkosi Diko was always in conflict with the British government and he blatantly refused the annexation of the amaBhaca nation's land. When the British supremacy pervaded the [[Transkei]] Territory during the 1860s, the government pioneered the annexation of the Transkeian Territories. The amakhosi were to give up their power and become subjects of the British Colonial Government. Magistrates were to take over power from the amaKhosi, especially those who refused to submit their nations to be under British rule. iNkosi Diko was one of those traditional leaders who resisted and he was then overthrown, deposed, and made headman by the Colonial Government in 1880.\n\nBattles were fought throughout this period. For example, a friend to iNkosi Diko was iNkosi Mhlontlo of amaMpondomise who is said to have killed a magistrate at [[Qumbu]] while resisting annexation. Other amaKhosi who accepted annexation were rewarded for their loyalty to the colonial government and were looked after and treated well.\n\nThe plan to destroy any trace of iNkosi Diko and his descendants has prevailed over generations after this great hero had died. Even today, Diko\u2019s files, from iNkosi Diko himself, Qoza ka-Diko, Mthakathi ka-Qoza, Mabhijela ka-Mthakathi, Dingumhlaba ka-Mabhijela and Mzawugugi ka-Dingumhlaba (all the descendants of Diko) have been removed from the archives in [[Mthatha]]. The big question is: What happened to these files and where are they?\n                                       \nAmaBhaca are mainly found in the small towns such as Mount Frere, [[Umzimkhulu|uMzimkhulu]], Xopo and some surrounding areas. The isiBhaca language is a mixture of [[Xhosa language|isiXhosa]], [[isiZulu]] and [[Swazi language|isiSwati]]. The language of isiSwati was influenced by the fact that King Madzikane\u2019s mother was from one of the Royal Houses of the Swatis of aMalambo. He grew up within the Swatis from his mother\u2019s side and therefore spoke the language. Although he accepts that he is not an authority on this, Jordan, A.C. (1953) argues and also asserts that in the traditional history of the Bhacas, \u201cuDlamini and kwaDlamini\u201d figure a great deal (P.5). He further states that the Bhaca language was stifled to death chiefly by isiXhasa through, amongst others, schools and churches and that a large number of enlightened Bhacas were taught to look down upon their mother tongue.\n\nDiko is the first son of Ncapayi, (Makhohlisa a daughter of Dzanibe clan was the first wife of Ncapayi) with his younger brother Sogoni from the first wife of Ncaphayi. The younger brother from the second wife was Inkosi Makaula followed by Inkosi Dabula and others from other younger wives. Inkosi Madzikane ll Diko is the crown prince of iNkosi Dilizintaba, ka Dingumhlaba, ka Mabhijela i, ka  kaMthakathi, kaQoza ka Diko ka Ncaphayi, ka Madzikane, ka Khalimeshe, ka Vebi, ka Wabane, ka Didi, ka Zulu, ka Ntombela, ka Malandela, ka Dlungwana, ka Ndaba.\n\nINkosi Madzikane II Thandisizwe Diko is currently the head of the kwaBhaca/LuBhacweni Traditional Council at ELundzini Royal Kraal, Ncunteni Great Place, LuBhacweni A/A in Mount Frere, KwaBhaca.\n\nAmaBhaca were therefore stripped off their dignity and their Kingdomship by the colonial powers, the Boers, the [[Griqua people|Griquas]] and later on, the [[apartheid]]  did not make it any better. The home of the Bhacas is in Mount Frere, while other Bhacas who went back to KwaZulu are in Mzimkhulu and Ixopo under the Zulu Kingdom.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Bhaca kings]]\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.bhaca.co.za Bhaca| AmaBhaca]\n\n{{Ethnic groups in South Africa}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Ethnic groups in South Africa]]\n[[Category:19th-century monarchs in Africa]]\n[[Category:South African chiefs]]\n[[Category:Monarchies of South Africa]]\n\n{{SouthAfrica-bio-stub}}\n{{Africa-royal-stub}}\n", "name_user": "FeanorStar7", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madzikane"}

Act One, Scene 1 opens directly on Brad and Janet as they are waving goodbye to newly wedded friends Ralph and Betty Hapschatt. For the film, the exterior location was an American-style small-town church. The original film script refers to it as the Denton Catholic Church, but as seen in the final film, it is the Denton Episcopal Church.\n\nA notable aspect of the film production for this number is the cemetery next to the church with a billboard in the distance for comical effect. It depicts a large heart with an arrow through it with the words, \"Denton, the Home of Happiness\". Brad and Janet stand on opposite sides of the screen with the cemetery in the background and the billboard far in the back, but directly between each character as the song begins.\n\nBeginning in an awkward and uncertain proclamation by Brad that he \"Has Something to say\". Janet awaits, clutching the bridal bouquet she just caught. In musical rhythm, he tells Janet that he really loves \"The Skillful Way\" she beat the other girls to the bride's bouquet.\n\nHe professes his love with metaphors of deep rivers and the future, all accompanied by the church staff dressed exactly as characters from the classic painting ''[[American Gothic]]'' by [[Grant Wood]]. The back-up throughout the stage play was a cast of \"Chorus\" singers credited as \"Phantoms\".\n\nThe scene in the movie begins to change. As the number progresses, we follow the couple into the church while the caretaker and staff begin to prepare for a funeral. They spin the white flower arrangements around to show that they are black on the other side, and a casket is carried in and placed in front of them just as Brad and Janet kiss.\n\n==Reception==\nThe song is considered to be one of the top \"heartfelt\" movie moments.<ref name=\"valentine\">{{cite news |last=Berg |first=Ken |date=8 February 1991 |newspaper=[[Orlando Sentinel]] |title=Valentine videos; Simmering cinema at home |page=16}}</ref> Further, the words \"Damn it, Janet\" are seen as an immortal part of cinematic history.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=[[The Albuquerque Tribune]] |date=28 October 1995 |title=TV Queen |page=1}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Silver |first=Vernon |date=20 November 1994 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |title=Film; A New Breed of Cult Favorites for a New Generation |page=224}}</ref>\n\nAlong with the characters of ''The Rocky Horror Picture Show'', the phrase \"Dammit, Janet!\" has entered the pop culture lexicon.<ref>{{cite news |last=Scheck |first=Frank |date=16 November 2000 |newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |title=The Rocky Horror Show |volume=Volume 365 |issue=Issue 36 |page=10}}</ref> The phrase has become so ingrained in society that thirty years after first singing the song for the film, American actor [[Barry Bostwick]] told an interviewer \"For as long as I live, people will be coming up to me and asking me to say, \"Dammit, Janet.

Act One, Scene 1 opens directly on Brad and Janet as they are waving goodbye to newly wedded friends Ralph and Betty Hapschatt. For the film, the exterior location was an American-style small-town church. The original film script refers to it as the Denton Catholic Church, but as seen in the final film, it is the Denton Episcopal Church.\n\nA notable aspect of the film production for this number is the cemetery next to the church with a billboard in the distance for comical effect. It depicts a large heart with an arrow through it with the words, \"Denton, the Home of Happiness\". Brad and Janet stand on opposite sides of the screen with the cemetery in the background and the billboard far in the back, but directly between each character as the song begins.\n\nBeginning in an awkward and uncertain proclamation by Brad that he \"Has Something to say\". Janet awaits, clutching the bridal bouquet she just caught. In musical rhythm, he tells Janet that he really loves \"The Skillful Way\" she beat the other girls to the bride's bouquet.\n\nHe professes his love with metaphors of deep rivers and the future, all accompanied by the church staff dressed exactly as characters from the classic painting ''[[American Gothic]]'' by [[Grant Wood]]. The back-up throughout the stage play was a cast of \"Chorus\" singers credited as \"Phantoms\".\n\nThe scene in the movie begins to change. As the number progresses, we follow the couple into the church while the caretaker and staff begin to prepare for a funeral. They spin the white flower arrangements around to show that they are black on the other side, and a casket is carried in and placed in front of them just as Brad and Janet kiss.\n\n==Reception==\nThe song is considered to be one of the top \"heartfelt\" movie moments.<ref name=\"valentine\">{{cite news |last=Berg |first=Ken |date=8 February 1991 |newspaper=[[Orlando Sentinel]] |title=Valentine videos; Simmering cinema at home |page=16}}</ref> Further, the words \"Damn it, Janet\" are seen as an immortal part of cinematic history.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=[[The Albuquerque Tribune]] |date=28 October 1995 |title=TV Queen |page=1}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Silver |first=Vernon |date=20 November 1994 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |title=Film; A New Breed of Cult Favorites for a New Generation |page=224}}</ref>\n\nAlong with the characters of ''The Rocky Horror Picture Show'', the phrase \"Dammit, Janet!\" has entered the pop culture lexicon.<ref>{{cite news |last=Scheck |first=Frank |date=16 November 2000 |newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |title=The Rocky Horror Show |volume=Volume 365 |issue=Issue 36 |page=10}}</ref> The phrase has become so ingrained in society that thirty years after first singing the song for the film, American actor [[Barry Bostwick]] told an interviewer \"For as long as I live, people will be coming up to me and asking me to say, \"Dammit, Janet.
