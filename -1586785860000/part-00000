The combination of painted surface and exaggerated depth of the support made the works deliberately and obviously three-dimensional objects \u2013 an \u2018attempt to deny the viewer the desire to see the surface as anything other than surface\u2019.<ref>(2003). \u201cArcs + Surfaces, A Conversation with Eric Butcher\u201d, p.11. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-08-0}}.</ref> This composed physical presence was inherent in even the most restrained of Butcher's works, as William Packer would go on to say in his introduction to Butcher's 2005 catalogue, Carbon Candy, \u2018even when hung conventionally, flat to the wall, they remain obviously and directly physical\u2019.<ref>\u201dCarbon Candy\u201d, p.4.

The introduction of metal as a support revolutionised Butcher's creative output and his approach to the act of painting, \u2018it may just be a flat piece of metal\u2026 But they all have little nicks, edges and imperfections\u2026 the end result is an accumulation of what I have learnt about that surface\u2019.<ref name=\"Arcs\" />\n[[File:Eric Butcher, ER.358.jpg|thumb|left|alt=ER.358.|ER.358 Oil and resin on extruded aluminium box sections.]]\n===Philosophy and approach to painting===\n\u2018The application or subtraction of paint\u2019 in Butcher's practice is executed through the use of \u2018a metal blade drawn across the painting\u2019s surface\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\">\u201dDefinite Article, Objects and Surfaces, Eric Butcher\u201d, p.7.

Although Butcher has a uniform approach to each work,<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> they nevertheless differ vastly from one another as the artist may encounter subtle material differences in the surface of each extrusion; burrs in the metal itself or unexpected variations in the applied paint wash.<ref>Sheldon, Julie (2007). \u201cUnderground\u201d, p.32. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9552820-6-5}}.</ref> Almost every piece will seek to preserve some element of the metal as well, \u2018the aluminium asserts itself as the artwork\u2019s true substance\u2019.<ref name=\"Baker\" /> As Butcher seeks to articulate the surfaces of aluminium structures,<ref name=\"ericbutcher\" /> he does so not only through the repetitive layers of colour application, but also through the preservation of the support's original condition (before his intervention) \u2013 both make for an overall representation of that particular structure's history.\n\nFor the Material Witness exhibition at Toomey Tourell gallery in 2010, Butcher exhibited fourteen of his painted aluminium extrusions.<ref name=\"Baker\">Baker, Kenneth (March 13, 2010). \u201cButcher Shines at Toomey Tourell\u201d. San Francisco Chronicle, p.E-1.</ref> Hung vertically and spaced asymmetrically with a measured and careful distance between one another,<ref name=\"Baker\" /> the display articulated Butcher's increasing awareness of, and preoccupation with, \u2018installation\u2019 in creating a total cohesive experience rather than an isolated object.<ref name=\"ericbutcher\" /> As Kenneth Baker, in his [[San Francisco Chronicle]] review, wrote of the work's interaction with the space it occupied, \u2018to walk this piece is to compose and recompose it through observation. Its geometry and built-in illusionism dictate that it cannot be seen whole\u2019.<ref name=\"Baker\" /> This can also be said of Butcher's curatorial practice, where, as in the Definite Article exhibition curated by the artist himself,<ref>\u201dDefinite Article, Objects and Surfaces, Eric Butcher\u201d, p.3. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-13-7}}.</ref> he deals with the scale and arrangement of works by Roger Ackling, [[Marc Vaux]] and Cathy Wade, as well as his own. Butcher's attempts within his own works in that exhibition to, \u2018engage the space around the painted surface\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> were similarly factors that he encountered in his curation of the exhibition as a whole, \u2018each of the artists\u2026 employs a range of techniques to encourage the viewer to engage with the work physically\u2019.<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" />\n[[File:Eric Butcher, GR.578.jpg|thumb|right|alt=GR.578.|GR.578 Blind embossed paper with cutouts.]]\n===Recent work===\nAs a consequence of this preoccupation with installation, some of Butcher's most recent pieces, his works on paper, experiment diagrammatically with possible arrangements for his large-scale installations of aluminium pieces, introducing elements of chance.<ref name=\"ConversationWith\">\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 77.

A Machine Aesthetic (co-curated with Sim\u00f3n Granell), was a major national touring exhibition presenting the work of 11 contemporary British artists whose creative practices engaged with the concept of mechanisation. The exhibition explored the various manifestations, uses and influences of different aspects of mechanisation within the practices of an otherwise diverse group of artists (with [[Andrew Bracey]], Eric Butcher, David Connearn, Rob Currie, Paul Goodfellow, Sim\u00f3n Granell, [[Emma Hart (artist)]], Dan Hays, Natasha Kidd, Tim Knowles, Michael Roberts). In conjunction with the exhibition, the curators guest edited an edition of the arts and culture magazine Garageland (issue XVI: Machines)<ref>[https://www.transitiongallery.co.uk/htmlpages/editions/GL16/intro.htm \"Garageland: issue XVI: Machines\" {{ISSN|1749-9267}}.</ref>, which was themed to coincide with the show.\n\n\n==Further reading==\n*Butcher Shines at Toomey Tourell, Kenneth Baker, San Francisco Chronicle, pg.

The combination of painted surface and exaggerated depth of the support made the works deliberately and obviously three-dimensional objects \u2013 an \u2018attempt to deny the viewer the desire to see the surface as anything other than surface\u2019.<ref>(2003). \u201cArcs + Surfaces, A Conversation with Eric Butcher\u201d, p.11. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-08-0}}.</ref> This composed physical presence was inherent in even the most restrained of Butcher's works, as William Packer would go on to say in his introduction to Butcher's 2005 catalogue, Carbon Candy, \u2018even when hung conventionally, flat to the wall, they remain obviously and directly physical\u2019.<ref>\u201dCarbon Candy\u201d, p.4.

The introduction of metal as a support revolutionised Butcher's creative output and his approach to the act of painting, \u2018it may just be a flat piece of metal\u2026 But they all have little nicks, edges and imperfections\u2026 the end result is an accumulation of what I have learnt about that surface\u2019.<ref name=\"Arcs\" />\n[[File:Eric Butcher, ER.358.jpg|thumb|left|alt=ER.358.|ER.358 Oil and resin on extruded aluminium box sections.]]\n===Philosophy and approach to painting===\n\u2018The application or subtraction of paint\u2019 in Butcher's practice is executed through the use of \u2018a metal blade drawn across the painting\u2019s surface\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\">\u201dDefinite Article, Objects and Surfaces, Eric Butcher\u201d, p.7.

Although Butcher has a uniform approach to each work,<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> they nevertheless differ vastly from one another as the artist may encounter subtle material differences in the surface of each extrusion; burrs in the metal itself or unexpected variations in the applied paint wash.<ref>Sheldon, Julie (2007). \u201cUnderground\u201d, p.32. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9552820-6-5}}.</ref> Almost every piece will seek to preserve some element of the metal as well, \u2018the aluminium asserts itself as the artwork\u2019s true substance\u2019.<ref name=\"Baker\" /> As Butcher seeks to articulate the surfaces of aluminium structures,<ref name=\"ericbutcher\" /> he does so not only through the repetitive layers of colour application, but also through the preservation of the support's original condition (before his intervention) \u2013 both make for an overall representation of that particular structure's history.\n\nFor the Material Witness exhibition at Toomey Tourell gallery in 2010, Butcher exhibited fourteen of his painted aluminium extrusions.<ref name=\"Baker\">Baker, Kenneth (March 13, 2010). \u201cButcher Shines at Toomey Tourell\u201d.

Its geometry and built-in illusionism dictate that it cannot be seen whole\u2019.<ref name=\"Baker\" /> This can also be said of Butcher's curatorial practice, where, as in the Definite Article exhibition curated by the artist himself,<ref>\u201dDefinite Article, Objects and Surfaces, Eric Butcher\u201d, p.3. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-13-7}}.</ref> he deals with the scale and arrangement of works by Roger Ackling, [[Marc Vaux]] and Cathy Wade, as well as his own. Butcher's attempts within his own works in that exhibition to, \u2018engage the space around the painted surface\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> were similarly factors that he encountered in his curation of the exhibition as a whole, \u2018each of the artists\u2026 employs a range of techniques to encourage the viewer to engage with the work physically\u2019.<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" />\n[[File:Eric Butcher, GR.578.jpg|thumb|right|alt=GR.578.|GR.578 Blind embossed paper with cutouts.]]\n===Recent work===\nAs a consequence of this preoccupation with installation, some of Butcher's most recent pieces, his works on paper, experiment diagrammatically with possible arrangements for his large-scale installations of aluminium pieces, introducing elements of chance.<ref name=\"ConversationWith\">\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 77.

The [[Indicia (publishing)|indicia]] continued describing the publication as 'Doctor Who Weekly' until issue 48. The cover title changed to '''''Doctor Who Monthly''''' with issue 61, and then to '''''The Official Doctor Who Magazine''''' with issue 85 in February 1984. It became '''''The Doctor Who Magazine''''' with issue 99 in April 1985, and simply '''''Doctor Who Magazine''''' with issue 107 in December 1985. The magazine has remained under that title ever since (although an exception was made for issue 397 in June 2008 when the cover only featured the words '''''Bad Wolf''''' following transmission of the ''Doctor Who'' episode \"[[Turn Left (Doctor Who)|Turn Left]]\" on Saturday 21 June).\n\nDespite the BBC discontinuing production of ''Doctor Who'' in 1989, the magazine continued to be published, providing new adventures in the form of comics.

It was announced on 27 January 2012 that ''Doctor Who Insider'' had ceased publication after nine issues. ''Doctor Who Insider'' returned for a special edition issue in 1 November 2012.\n\nPanini has begun to digitally restore and reprint older ''DWM'' comics in [[#Comic Strip: Collected editions|trade paperback]] format. Twenty-five volumes have been printed so far: two featuring the comics adventures of the [[Fourth Doctor]], one with the adventures of the [[Fifth Doctor]], two featuring the [[Sixth Doctor]], five with the adventures of the [[Seventh Doctor]], four focusing on the [[Eighth Doctor]], one with the adventures of the [[Ninth Doctor]], three featuring the [[Tenth Doctor]], four collecting the adventures of the [[Eleventh Doctor]] and four with the adventures of the [[Twelfth Doctor]].

The incumbent editor Gary Russell \u2013 who would go on the produce the [[Big Finish Productions]] ''Doctor Who'' audios dramas from their inception, and to work for [[BBC Wales]] as a Script Editor on the ''Doctor Who'' spin-offs ''[[The Sarah Jane Adventures]]'' and ''[[Torchwood]]'' \u2013 was 'asked to leave'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bigfinish.com/news/news_060709_allchange.shtml\n|title=All Change at Big Finish\n|date=9 July 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060821040334/http://www.bigfinish.com/news/news_060709_allchange.shtml |archivedate = 21 August 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|date=3 September 2006|title = Bride on Time!|journal = Doctor Who Magazine|issue = 373}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Gray |first=Scott |date=2019 |title=\"Commentary: Black Destiny\" in Doctor Who: Ground Zero |publisher=Panini |page=122}}</ref> The editorship was taken over by recently hired comic strip editor, Gary Gillatt.

The ''DWM'' strip thus took over from what has become known as the [[Doctor Who Polystyle comic strip|\u2018Polystyle era\u2019]] (1964-1979) of ''Doctor Who'' comic strips.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-11\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 11</ref> Paul Scoones, an historian of the ''Doctor Who'' comic strip, writes: 'First launched in the pages of ''TV Comic'' in November 1964, the comic strip version of ''Doctor Who'' is just one year younger than the television series on which it is based. The strip appeared almost every week: first in ''TV Comic'', then in ''Countdown'' and ''TV Action'' before returning to ''TV Comic''. All these titles were produced by a company called Polystyle Publications  (formally TV Publications), which held the rights to publish a ''Doctor Who'' comic [strip] until May 1979 when the last instalment of the strip appeared [\u2026] Once relinquished by Polystyle, the rights were soon snapped up by Marvel UK, who created their own ongoing comic [strip]. This new strip [\u2026] continues to this day'.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-11\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 11</ref> The main comic strip features the contemporary television Doctor (beginning with the [[Fourth Doctor]] who was on TV at the time ''DWM'' launched), sometimes with his on-screen companion(s), and sometimes with companion(s) created by the ''DWM'' writers. During some of the period when ''Doctor Who'' was off-air, in the wake of the [[Seventh Doctor]], the ''DWM'' main strip featured stories with all the previous Doctors (1994-1996) but continued with the [[Eighth Doctor]] after the broadcast of the [[Doctor Who (film)|TV movie]] (1996). In 2004, when the series returned to television, showrunner Russell T Davies offered to let ''DWM'' write and publish the official regeneration scene from the Eighth Doctor to the [[Ninth Doctor]]. Although work was done on this storyline, then editor [[Clayton Hickman]] and writer [[Scott Gray (writer)|Scott Gray]] eventually turned down the offer as they felt they couldn't do such an important event justice under the constraints imposed by the TV series' continuity.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Flood |first1=Scott |last1=Gray |authorlink1=Scott Gray (writer) |first2=Gareth |last2=Roberts |authorlink2=Gareth Roberts (writer) |first3=Martin |last3=Geraghty |authorlink3=Martin Geraghty |location=[[Tunbridge Wells]] |publisher=Panini |year=2007 |series=Complete eighth Doctor comic strips |volume=4 |isbn=978-1-905239-65-8 |pages=221\u2013223}}</ref> In October 2018 (issue 531), the main comic strip began featuring the [[Thirteenth Doctor]] in \"The Warmonger\".<ref>{{cite journal|date=October 2018|title = \"The Warmonger\" |journal = Doctor Who Magazine|issue = 531| pages = 47\u201354}}</ref>\n\nAs well as a main strip, ''DWM'' has also featured other comics strips over the years. In its first incarnation as ''Doctor Who Weekly'' the main strip was accompanied by a specially commissioned secondary strip exploring stories from across the Whoniverse, and a tertiary strip of reprints from other Marvel publications. The secondary strip continued with the transformation of the magazine into a monthly publication, finally ending in May 1982 (issue 64), albeit becoming more infrequent over the previous year. A tertiary strip, named 'Tales from the TARDIS', ran in ''Doctor Who Weekly'' until late April 1980 (issue 29). These re-used adaptations of classic works of literary science fiction previously published in [[Marvel Classics Comics]] (USA). In late May 1980 (issue 33), the tertiary strip returned reprinting the \"Dalek Chronicles\" (aka \"Dalek Tapes\"), a strip originally published as a one-pager in ''[[TV Century 21]]'' as \"The Daleks\" (1965-1967). This tertiary Dalek strip ended in September 1982 (issue 68) after completing about half of the original run. Since 1982, other strips have appeared again from time to time. For instance, in the 1990s a [[Cyberman]] one-pager strip was featured on the inside cover (3 August 1994 \u2013 8 May 1996 [issues 215-238]). Titled \"The Cybermen\", the series was set on their home planet of [[Mondas]] prior to the events of the television episode ''[[The Tenth Planet]]'' (1966). The ''TV Century 21'' comic \"The Daleks\" was also resurrected for a short time in 1997 (12 March-30 July [issues 249-254]), drawn in the same style as the 1960s original and continuing the story from where it had left off by showing the [[Dalek]]s attacking Earth. Other than this and since then, secondary and tertiary strips have been as rare as hen's teeth, and usually either one or two episodes.\n\nThe ''DWM'' comic strips were all originally printed in black and white (except with a minor - page-count-wise - exception for two pages of \"The Tides of Time\" [July 1982: issue 66]).<ref>{{cite journal|date=26 May 1993|title =Behind The Frame|journal = Doctor Who Classic Comics|issue = Issue 7|page = 32-33}}</ref> The main strip, beginning in 1979 with the Fourth Doctor story \"The Iron Legion\" (17 October - 5 December [issues 1-8]), began being issued in colour as of issue 300 in 2001 with the Eighth Doctor story \"Ophidius\" (February\u2013May [issues 300-303]). However, as early as December 1980 colourised reprints of the early Fourth Doctor main strip and secondary strips appeared in Marvel USA publications: ''[[Marvel Premiere]]: Doctor Who'' (every two months between December 1980 and June 1981 [issues 57-60]) successfully trialled the concept for an American audience to determine if it would attract enough readers; a ''Doctor Who'' comic series being launched in 1984. The series came to an end with issue 23 in August 1986, having colourised and reprinted all the Fourth Doctor strips and four of the six strips of the [[Fifth Doctor]] era, as well as 24 of the 27 ''DWM'' secondary strip stories originally published between 1979 and 1982. Reprints of the original ''DWM'' strips have also appeared in their original black and white as well as colourised in a dizzying number of formats, especially during the Marvel years (1979\u20131995). These Marvel UK (or Marvel licensed) parallel publications were: ''Doctor Who Magazine Specials'' (1980\u20131996); ''Doctor Who Magazine Graphic Novels'' (1989\u20131993); ''Doctor Who Classic Comics'' (1992\u20131994) and ''Doctor Who Yearbooks'' (1992\u20131996). Many of these publications also printed original strips as well. Another original ''Doctor Who'' strip also appeared in ''The Incredible Hulk Presents'' comic series (1989), and the Doctor appeared as a guest character in the first ''Death's Head'' series (1989; rejigged and reprinted as \"Incomplete Death's Head\" in 1993). Spin-off strips and reprints have become much more limited and much more focused during the Panini Years (1995\u2013present). There was a short-lived original Eighth Doctor strip for the [[Radio Times]] (1996-1997), some original [[Ninth Doctor|Ninth]] and [[Tenth Doctor]] strips in the ''Annual'' and ''Storybooks'' (2006\u20132010), and two sets of reprints of the [[Ninth Doctor]] strips (2006) and some of the [[Tenth Doctor]] strips (2008) in the relaunched and rebranded ''Special Editions'' (2002\u2013present). Returning to the origins of the ''DWM'' main strip, Panini licenced [[IDW Publishing|IDW]], an American comic book company, for new digitalised colour reprints of Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Doctor stories. Beginning in January 2008 and running into 2013, IDW printed its ''Doctor Who Classics'' monthly comic book series, going on to collect the colourised strips into various trade paperbacks and omnibus editions.\n\nNotable writers and artists who have worked on the ''DWM'' comic strips, in all its myriad forms include [[John Wagner]],<ref name=\"ad1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.2000ad.org/thrillpower/classicdoctorwho.html |title=Titan / Panini Graphic novels, collections and trade paperbacks: Doctor Who |website=2000AD |accessdate=1 July 2017}}</ref> [[Pat Mills]],<ref name=\"ad1\" /> [[Alan Moore]], [[Grant Morrison]], [[Dave Gibbons]],<ref name=\"ad1\" /> [[Mike McMahon (comics)|Mike McMahon]], [[John Ridgway (comic artist)|John Ridgway]] and [[Ian Edginton]]. Supporting characters created by such writers for ''DWM'' have even crossed over from the comic to other spin-off media include [[Frobisher (Doctor Who)|Frobisher]], the shape-changing companion of the [[Sixth Doctor|Sixth]] and [[Seventh Doctor|Seventh]] Doctors who would appear in [[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish]] audios; [[Abslom Daak]], the [[Dalek]] Killer; the [[Special Executive]], who would later appear in Marvel's ''[[Captain Britain]]''; and the villainous [[Beep the Meep]].\n\nDuring the mid-2000s, in the wake of the successful return of ''Doctor Who'' to television, the BBC began offering multiple comic strip publishing licences effectively ending the monopoly held by ''DWM'' since they had taken over where Polystyle had left off. In 2006, the [[partwork]] publishers [[GE Fabbri]] acquired the license to produce ''[[Doctor Who \u2013 Battles in Time]]'', a fortnightly magazine with a [[Collectible card game|trading card game]] and its own ''Doctor Who'' comic strip. The final issue (number 70) was released on 13 May 2009. Around the same time, [[Immediate Media Company|IMC]] launched ''[[Doctor Who Adventures]]'', its comic strip and features aimed at 6 to 13-year-olds, a younger demographic than the ''DWM'' readership. Initially published every fortnight, from 2008 it went weekly, returning to fortnightly in May 2013, then monthly in 2014. In April 2015, the title was purchased by Panini, the publishers of ''DWM'', who rebooted the publication beginning again with issue 1, changing it to bi-monthly in late 2016. On 19 June 2017, Panini confirmed that publication of the magazine was to be paused after issue 24.<ref>{{cite news|title=Doctor Who Adventures To Pause Publication|url=http://www.doctorwhonews.net/2017/06/doctor-who-adventures-to-pause.html|accessdate=29 July 2017|publisher=Doctor Who News|date=19 June 2017}}</ref> A special one-off edition was released in January 2019. Finally, IDW - who were reprinting early ''DWM'' strips in their ''Doctor Who Classics'' series - launched a parallel range of ongoing comics featuring the Tenth Doctor in early 2008. Over the next six years, until the end of 2013, there were series and ones-shots featuring the Tenth then Eleventh Doctor, even producing a cross over with \"[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]] / Doctor Who : Assimilation2\". IDW ceded their license to [[Titan Publishing Group|Titan]] in 2014, who have since created a complex number of parallel ''Doctor Who'' series for both nu-''Who'' and classic Doctors. Titan have collected the IDW and Titan comics into various format collectors editions, scaling back production since the beginning of the Thirteenth Doctor era.\n\nDespite the competition of ''Battles in Time'', ''Doctor Who Adventures'', and the IDW/Titan series, ''DWM'' and its main comic strip has continued unabated. A sign of its rude health is that Panini continue to publish the ongoing ''Doctor Who Comic Strip Collected Editions'' which began in 2004. Over the subsequent years the ''Collected Editions'' have reprinted all the ''Doctor Who'' main strips in their original size (A4) and format (ie, black and white for ''DWM'' issues 1-299), as well as many secondary, tertiary, and parallel publication strips. As of December 2019 there have been 29 volumes released, with the first ''Thirteenth Doctor Collected Edition'' (volume 30) due in 2020.\n\n=== Cartoons and illustrated short stories ===\n\nThe publication also features parody cartoons, most notably \"Doctor Who?\", a humorous look at the series by Tim Quinn and Dicky Howett. This was principally a three-panel [[comic strip]], though occasionally page-long parodies were featured. Also, between 1989 and 1992 \"The Comic Assassins\" was a series of parody strips by Steve Noble and [[Kev F. Sutherland]]. \"Doctor Who?\"'s spiritual successor was the single-panel strip \"Doctor Whoah!\" by 'Baxter'. Embedded into the 'Galaxy Forum' letters page, it lampooned a recent episode, DVD release of stories or other such event by showing alternative, exaggerated and expanded versions of ''Doctor Who'' scenes. For example, after the broadcast of \"[[Partners in Crime (Doctor Who)|Partners in Crime]]\" (2008), the strip portrayed the Doctor's arrival on the 'Planet of the Hats', referred to in the episode. The strip was known for its characters who are depicted as having no pupils in their eyes. Since 2014, \"Doctor Whoah!\" has been replaced by \"The Daft Dimension\", a similarly sized strip in three panels by [[Lew Stringer]].\n\n''DWM'' has also published illustrated short stories in its magazine and parallel publications, most cohesively during the Marvel years. Beginning in ''Doctor Who Weekly'' on 9 April 1980 (issue 26), a sequence of these short stories ran for eight issues, returning is shorts burst for a number of issues every few years up until 1996. Occasional illustrated short stories have appeared since then, including the many parallel publications in both Marvel and Panini years. In addition, there was also a run of 'Brief Encounters', very short one or two page illustrated stories that ran from 28 November 1990 (issue 167) through to 6 July 1994 (issue 214) as well as in contemporary \"Specials\" and \"Yearbooks\" between 1991 and 1992.\n\n=== Regular features and special articles ===\nOther regular features of the magazine include the news section \"Gallifrey Guardian\", which has run since nearly the beginning of the magazine; the letters page \"Galaxy Forum\" which \u2013 as well as containing the \"Daft Dimension\" strip \u2013 features other small sub-sections, such as \"Ask DWM!\" (where readers' questions about the show are answered), \"On This Month\" (which looks at an old issue on the anniversary of its publication) and \"WhoTube\" (which highlights \"Doctor Who\"-themed videos which can be viewed online); reviews of television episodes and merchandise (in \"The DWM Review\", known for a time as \"After Image\", \"Off the Shelf\", and \"Shelf Life\"); the \"Time Team\", which involves four fans watching every ''Doctor Who'' story in order from the beginning; and, since production restarted on the series in 2004, a regular column \"Production Notes\" by the show's executive producer. From 2004 to 2009 the column was written by [[Russell T Davies]], and from January 2010 to July 2017, [[Steven Moffat]] took over the page, although other writers and production staff have from time-to-time written the column. Also, on the final page of magazine, there is a section called \"Wotcha!\" (compiled by 'The Watcher'), a comedy page with such recurring features as, 'A History of Doctor Who in 100 Objects', 'Supporting Artist of the Month', a spoof 'Top Ten', the 'Stockbridge English Dictionary' (a variation on a game from ''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue]]'') and a true or false quiz \"The Six Faces of Delusion\". Prior to this, the slot was taken up by a page called \"Who on Earth is...\", featuring a short interview with someone previously (or currently) involved in Doctor Who (say, a member of the cast).\n\nA single-page 'opinion' column has often been part of the magazine's mix \u2013 past columns have included \"Fluid Links\" by [[Matt Jones (writer)|Matt Jones]], \"The Life and Times of Jackie Jenkins\" by 'Jackie Jenkins', \"It's the End... But\" by 'The Watcher', \"You Are Not Alone\" by [[Jonathan Morris (author)|Jonathan Morris]] (as 'Neil Harris') and \"Relative Dimensions\" by author (and former \"Time Team\" member) [[Jacqueline Rayner]]. The format has changed over the years, but the news, letters, reviews, and comic strip have all been present consistently since the early 1980s.\n\nThe magazine also features interviews with the cast and crew of the television show (including the old episodes), and reports from the set of the current series, written by [[Benjamin Cook (journalist)|Benjamin Cook]] or [[Jason Arnopp]]. The behind-the-scenes stories of all of the 1963\u20131989 episodes have been documented in Andrew Pixley's \"DWM Archive\", and detailed analysis of certain significant serials are covered in \"The Fact of Fiction\", usually written by former ''DWM'' editor [[Alan Barnes (writer)|Alan Barnes]], [[Jonathan Morris (author)|Jonathan Morris]] or David Bailey. \"The DWM Review\" is currently written predominantly by [[Graham Kibble-White]], former editor Gary Gillatt, Paul Kirkley, Martin Ruddock and Matt Michael. Previous reviewers include [[Vanessa Bishop]], [[Craig Hinton]] (died in 2006), and [[Gary Russell]], who subsequently became the magazine's editor.\n\n== ''DWM'' Parallel Publications: Marvel Years (1979\u20131995) ==\n\nDuring the Marvel years (1979\u20131995), ''Doctor Who Magazine'' produced three types of \"Deluxe edition\" series issued in parallel to the main publication. These were the semi-regular '''Specials''' generally issued twice a year seasonally, and most usually labelled \"Summer\" and \"Winter\" (1980\u20131996); '''Yearbooks''', essentially annuals, issued once a year in advance and for Christmas (1992\u20131996); and '''Poster Magazines''', a short run of more visually orientated periodicals with single themes (1994\u20131996). All these series came to an end in the wake of Panini acquiring Marvel, and consequently, ''Doctor Who Magazine'' in 1995.\n\nIn addition, and since its very beginning, ''DWM'' comic strips have been reprinted and - on a few occasions had their original release - in many other publications and formats. Reprinting of ''DWM'' strips began as early as 1980 in parallel serial publications, and over the years there have been a number of such comic reprints and collections, many of which colourised the original strips. In addition, there have also been some original strips issued through these publications. Some series have even reprinted some of the earlier pre-''DWM'' [[Polystyle Publications]] ''Doctor Who'' comic strips that appeared in [[TV Comic]], which began in 1964 and ended when ''DWM'' gained the comic strip licence in 1979. There have also been original ''Doctor Who'' strips in other Marvel publications, and the Doctor appearing in other original Marvel strips (all of which dovetail with the main ''DWM'' strip). Finally, other publishers have reprinted ''DWM'' strips under licence.\n\n=== ''Doctor Who'' Comics USA (1980\u20131986) ===\nThe first series of reprints of ''DWM'' comic strips began in late 1980, only a year or so after the original publication in 1979. These reprints were for the American market, and consisted of four issues in the ''[[Marvel Premiere]]'' series. The ''Marvel Premiere'' series was considered a testing ground to determine if a character or concept could attract enough readers to justify launching their own series. The four issues were considered a success, and so eventually became a series beginning in 1984, titled simply ''Doctor Who''.<ref>{{cite journal|date=October 1984|title = Doctor Who |journal = Marvel USA|issue = 1| page = 3}}</ref> Again, these were reprints were from ''DWM'', and began soon after where ''Marvel Premiere'' left off (skipping a two part strip, perhaps appropriately titled \"Timeslip\" [issues 17-18], a Fourth Doctor story featuring the First, Second, and Third Doctors; this was eventually published in ''Doctor Who'' issue 18). All these strip reprints were colourised for the first time; as were supporting secondary Doctorless strips also taken from ''DWM'' (or, on limited occasions, ''DWM'' Specials). Both ''Marvel Premiere: Doctor Who'' and ''Doctor Who'' had regular features and special articles.\n\n* '''''Marvel Premiere: Doctor Who''''' (Issues 57-60): From December 1980 to June 1981 once every two months, Marvel USA experimented with the ''DWM Doctor Who'' comic strip for an American audience. For four issues they reprinted the earliest two Fourth Doctor main strips. These were now colourised, and with new covers displaying the ''Doctor Who'' logo of the time. These four issues of ''Marvel Premiere: Doctor Who'' were a test run for an American style ''Doctor Who'' comic, which eventually began publishing in 1984. In some editions there were just strips (with the exception of a letters page); in some editions there were also short features. Furthermore, in two editions there were secondary strips, in one instance a ''DWM'' secondary strip, and in the other a non-''Doctor Who'' strip - both of which were in colour.\n\n* '''''Doctor Who''''' (Marvel Comics USA) (Issues 1-23): From October 1984 to August 1986, and following the success of the trial run of ''Marvel Premiere: Doctor Who'', Marvel Comics published a monthly comic book series in America titled simply ''Doctor Who'', that reprinted the Fourth Doctor and some of the earliest Fifth Doctor main strips. Beginning soon after where ''Marvel Premiere: Doctor Who'' had concluded (skipping the third story of the original run, which was eventually published later in the run), once again the strips were colourised and had new covers, but they also appeared in a 'glossy format' rather than traditional American style rough paper print. There were also ''DWM'' secondary strips (again, colourised from the original black and white); or on limited occasions strips taken from early ''DWM'' Specials. The comic had regular features, from issue three a letters column and, from issue 13, \"Who Knows\", described as 'Happenings in the world of ''Doctor Who'''.<ref>{{cite journal|date=December 1984|title = Doctor Who |journal = Marvel USA|issue = 3|page =34}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|date=June 1985|title = Doctor Who |journal = Marvel USA|issue = 13|page =3}}</ref> There were also occasional short special articles on the television show, such as overviews of characters, and interviews with cast and crew members.\n\nThe list below covers all comic strip colourised reprints and notable special articles:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=\"border:none\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"|List of ''Doctor Who'' Comics USA\n|-\n|style=\"padding:0;border:none\"|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|'''USA#''' || '''Title''' ||'''Issue''' ||'''Date''' || '''Pages''' || '''Contents''' || '''References'''\n|-\n\n| 01 || ''Marvel Premiere: Doctor Who'' || 57 || December 1980 || 36 \n|\n''Comic strip (colourised reprints):''\n*\"The Iron Legion\" [1-4 of 8] [DWM issues 1-4] (4D)\n''Articles:''\n*Full page illustration: \"The Five Doctors\" \n*\"Who Is the Doctor\" (2 page written feature on the Doctors) \n*Full page illustrations: \"The Tardis and K-9\";

Unlike the main strip, however, it did not begin by reprinting the secondary strip from the first issue of ''Doctor Who Weekly''. Rather, ''K-9's Finest Hour'' came from issue 12 (2 January 1980). The previous secondary strips (\"The Return of the Daleks\", \"Throwback: The Soul of a Cyberman\", \"The Final Quest\", and \"A Tale of the Time Lords: The Stolen Tardis\") would all run in order from the first issue of ''Doctor Who'' (Marvel USA) to issue 4; with issue 5 printing the story after ''K-9's Finest Hour''.\n* '''b''' {{Note|Doctor_Who_USA_b}} ''Doctor Who'' (Marvel USA) began by reprinting the fourth story from the main comic strip of ''DWM'', ''Doctor Who: Marvel Premiere'' having printed the first two main strips. These publications thus skipped the third story of the run, \"Timeslip\" (issues 17-18; 6\u201313 February 1980). Perhaps this was because while it was a Fourth Doctor strip, it also featured the First, Second, and Third Doctors, and was felt not to be an appropriate way to launch the new publication.\n* '''c''' {{Note|Doctor_Who_USA_c}} The previous issue of ''Doctor Who'' (Marvel USA) had reprinted as its secondary strip the final episode of \"Abslom Daak\u2026 Dalek-Killer\", the secondary strip from ''DWM'' issue 20. This issue of ''Doctor Who'' (Marvel USA) skipped ahead to reprint \"Star Tigers\" [I] as its secondary strip, which began in ''DWM'' issue 27 (as a secondary strip). Thus ''Doctor Who'' (Marvel USA) did not reprint the ''DWM'' secondary strips \"Twilight of the Silurians\", \"Ship of Fools\", and \"The Outsider\". This was no doubt done because \"Star Tigers\" [I] featured the character Abslom Daak and thus had continuity with the previous issue of ''Doctor Who'' (Marvel USA). These three strips were, however, reprinted later in the run, although not in the original order.\n* '''d''' {{Note|Doctor_Who_USA_d}} Once again, as with previous issues of ''Doctor Who'' (Marvel USA), the secondary strip misses out reprinting a number of other secondary strip from ''DWM'' in order to continue the adventures of Abslom Daak in the second and final \"Star Tigers\" story. \"Star Tigers\" [II] begins in issue 44 of ''DWM'' with \"Star Tigers\" [I] concluding in issue 30, thus the secondary strips \"Yonder\u2026 The Yeti\", \"Black Legacy\", and \"Business as Usual\" are skipped (although ''DWM'' carried no secondary strip in issues 39). However, these three skipped ''DWM'' secondary strips appeared in ''Doctor Who'' (Marvel USA) issues 13-15, after the conclusion of \"Star Tigers\" [II].\n* '''e''' {{Note|Doctor_Who_USA_e}} \"Yonder\u2026 The Yeti\" and the next two secondary strips over the next two issues of ''Doctor Who'' (Marvel USA), \"Black Legacy\" and \"Business as Usual\", were the second of two sets of secondary comic strips skipped in order to bring continuity to the \"Abslom Daak\" trilogy (\"Abslom Daak\u2026 Dalek-Killer\",  \"Star Tigers\" [I], and  \"Star Tigers\" [II]) that had appeared non-sequentially in ''DWM'' over the year 1980. After \"Star Tigers\" [II], ''Doctor Who'' (Marvel USA) reprinted the second batch in the order of original publication.\n* '''f''' {{Note|Doctor_Who_USA_f}} \"Ship of Fools\" is a reprint of one the first set of skipped secondary strips that accommodated running the \"Abslom Daak\" trilogy in order, these secondary strips were originally presented non-sequentially in ''DWM'' (\"Abslom Daak\u2026 Dalek-Killer\",  \"Star Tigers\" [I], and  \"Star Tigers\" [II]). \"Twilight of the Silurians\" and \"The Outsider\" - also from the first set of skipped secondary strips - were eventually reprinted, although out of sequence, and mixed in with other ''DWM'' secondary strips. In effect, from this point on ''Doctor Who'' (Marvel USA) freely selects from the remaining ''DWM'' secondary strips abandoning tracking of original order of publication entirely. Regular original ''DWM'' secondary strips finished as of issue 64, and became less frequent over the last few of these issues. Basically, all the secondary strips from ''DWM'' were reprinted colourised from ''DWM'' issue 1-46; and of the remaining 11 strips eight were reprinted before ''Doctor Who'' (Marvel USA) ceased publication.\n* '''g''' {{Note|Doctor_Who_USA_g1}}{{Note|Doctor_Who_USA_g2}} \"Skywatch-7\" was a two part Doctorless comic strip which had its first part published as a secondary strip in ''DWM'' (issue 58) and its second part published in the ''DWM'' Winter Special 1981, both of which were released around the same time in late 1981.\n|}\n|}\n\n''Doctor Who'' (Marvel USA) ceased publication with issue 23 in August 1986. Editor [[Jim Salicrup]] explained the reason as being 'poor sales. Despite a good start, and rather good sales in areas where ''Doctor Who'' (the television programme) is in syndication, sales have been off. Producing ''Doctor Who'' [Marvel USA] in this format has been expensive, and without sufficient sales support it was decided to discontinue [\u2026] rather than sacrifice the quality of the magazine'.<ref>{{cite journal|date=August 1986|title = Doctor Who |journal = Marvel USA|issue = 23|page =2}}</ref> Salicrup is essentially referring to the added costs of the glossy paper and the strips needing to go through a process of colouration.\n\nIn summary, over the entire run of ''Marvel Premiere: Doctor Who'' and ''Doctor Who'' the magazine reprinted in colourised form:\n* the ''DWM'' main comic strip from issue 1 (17 October 1979) through to 77 (June 1983) in consecutive order, with the exception of \"Timeslip\" (''DWM'' issues 17-18) which was initially skipped but included much later in the run essentially as a ''Doctor Who'' (Marvel USA) secondary strip. Thus, the magazine included all the Fourth Doctor strips, and the first four (of a total of six) Fifth Doctor strips.\n* the ''DWM'' Doctorless secondary strip, mostly in order from the beginning of ''Doctor Who'' (Marvel USA) - except for a one part story in ''Marvel Premiere: Doctor Who'' - up until issue 13, when \"Abslom Daak\u2026 Dalek-Killer\" was followed by later strips featuring the character. After that, secondary strips were placed increasingly randomly. Over the entire original run of 27 secondary strips in ''DWM'' (from issue 1 to 64, after which they came to an end as a continuous feature), Marvel USA comics reprinted 24 of these. The exceptions were the one-part stories: \"Star Death\" (''DWM'' #47), \"4-D War\" (''DWM'' #51), and \"Black Sun Rising\" (''DWM'' #57).\n* three Doctorless strips from early ''DWM'' Specials (not including a parody strip from ''DWM'' Winter Special 1983/84 [1983]). One from the ''DWM'' Winter Special 1981 (the second part of story began in ''DWM''); and two from the ''DWM'' Special Summer 1982. The ''Doctor Who Magazine'' Specials are listed in full in the next subsection.\n\n=== ''Doctor Who Magazine Specials'' (1980\u20131996) ===\n\nFrom 1980 to 1996 ''DWM'' released a series of 'Specials' with an increased page count. Early on, the Specials tended to have a mix of articles and comic strips (both reprints and originals). However, after the first few issues and up to about half way through the run, the publication tended to be just composed of articles; with the occasional issue dedicated to comic strip reprints, essentially a 'Graphic Novel' (some in the original black & white, some colourised). The second half of the run went back to including a comic strip in article based issues, during which time there were also two 'Graphic Novels' (both in colour, one reprints, one original). Occasionally, issues carried illustrated short stories. The Specials began by being published twice a year during the summer and winter, and were usually, although not always, branded as such. This changed over the period 1987-1989 when there was only one a year (two for anniversaries), and then none in 1990. The twice year schedule resumed in 1991 again with summer and winter editions, before becoming a little more erratic during and after 1994 to the end of the run. The final two issues were devoted to ''Doctor Who'' movies: *\"[[Dr. Who and the Daleks]]\" and \"[[Daleks \u2013 Invasion Earth: 2150 A.D.]]\" (issue 29) and ''[[Doctor Who (film)|Doctor Who: The Movie]]'' (issue 30).\n\nThese Specials were not numbered, and sometimes contained no indicia or did not specify their status in the indicia - accordingly, confusion has arisen over the years between the Specials and some one-off ''DWM'' comic strip publications from the same period (some named Graphic Novels in their indicia, some with no indicia, or just the title of the publication in the indicia). However, in 2016 ''DWM'' provided a pictorial overview of what they considered official ''DWM'' Specials in their ''Doctor Who Magazine: 500 DWM Issues'' bonus 'Souvenir' publication that came free with ''DWM'' issue 500.<ref name=\"Spilsbury2016-110-111\">\"And Finally... Don't Forget the Specials!\" in Spilsbury (2016), p. 110-111</ref> The list below follows the overview therein, but the issue numbering is imposed for ease of tracking, and was never included in the actual publications. The table below also attempts to capture the flavour of the different types of issue with the labelling 'Seasonal Specials', 'Graphic Novels', 'Anniversary Issues', and 'Movie Specials'. In some cases, however, a single Special can be more than one of these types (such as labelled a seasonal special and an anniversary issue); once again, the numbering is imposed on these issues for ease of tracking the type.\n\n*'''Seasonal Specials''' [SS] (which predominated): most usually twice a year for Winter and Summer, and labelled as such. The covers only rarely indicated the year.\n*'''Graphic Novels''' [GN] (occasional): around half of all the Specials had comic strips, but six were devoted entirely to, or substantially to, comic strips. Note, the numbering here tracks all Marvel era ''Doctor Who'' Graphic Novels across its many different publications (for the full overview see the 'Doctor Who Magazine Graphic Novels (1989\u20131993)' subsection below).\n*'''Anniversary Issues''' [A] (three editions): for the 25th Anniversary of the television series (November 1988); the 10th Anniversary of ''Doctor Who Magazine'' (October 1989); and finally the 30th Anniversary of the television series (November 1993) which was also labelled (unlike the other anniversary editions) a seasonal special for Winter 1993.\n*'''Movie Specials''' [M] (the final two editions): \"The Sixties Dalek Movies\" (also labelled \"Spring Special\") (February 1996); and \"The ''Doctor Who Movie'' Special\" (May 1996) celebrating the return of ''Doctor Who'' to the screen after seven years without any television presence.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=\"border:none\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"|List of ''Doctor Who Magazine

In addition, the 10th Special issue (which comes out in addition to the two seasonal Specials in 1985) reprints these same two strips again (now colourised - see note below) without the articles, and there is no way that cannot be considered a Graphic Novel. \n* '''b''' {{Note|DWM_Specials_b}} \"Skywatch-7\" was a two part Doctorless comic strip which had its first part published as a secondary strip in ''DWM'' (issue 58) and its second part published in the ''DWM'' Winter Special 1981, both of which were released around the same time in late 1981.\n* '''c''' {{Note|DWM_Specials_c}} No indicia in this publication, and no date on cover.

They were first collected and reprinted in the first edition of the Specials: ''Doctor Who Magazine'' Summer Special [1980]. Soon after they were then colourised by Andy Yanchus for ''[[Marvel Premiere]]: Doctor Who'', the Marvel USA try-out publication, used to determine if a character or concept could attract enough readers to justify launching their own series. \"The Iron Legion\" appeared in the first two issues (of the four issue run) in December 1980 (issue 57) and February 1981 (issue 58); \"K9's Finest Hour\" was a secondary strip in December 1980 (issue 57) (see the section 'Doctor Who Marvel Comics USA [1980\u20131986]' above for more information). Accordingly, the reprints here in the '1985 Summer Special Classic' are collected reprints of colourised reprints of an original black and white strip that had also been collected in its original black and white in an earlier edition of the same run of Specials! Things will only get more convoluted here on in... with more black and white reprints and digitally re-coloured versions in other subsequent publications.\n* '''g''' {{Note|DWM_Specials_g}} Indicia does not indicate this is a Special, reading ''Doctor Who Magazine Collected Comics''.

This run eventually went to colour, but never completed. It began again in ''DWM'' in colour with the first episode of ''The Dalek Chronicles'' in issue 180 (27 November 1991) but only ran for a few episodes before transferring to ''Doctor Who Classic Comics'' (1992\u20131994) in its first issue to completion. Accordingly, this ''The Daleks Chronicles'' publication could be seen as much as a ''Doctor Who Classic Comics'' Special (like the previous year's ''Doctor Who Classic Comics: Autumn Special'' printing of ''Evening Empire'' [September 1993]), if it weren't for the indicia (see footnote i). \n* '''m''' {{Note|DWM_Specials_m}} The second and third episodes of \"The Penta Ray Factor\" are printed out of order.

Six years later, Panini kicked off production of 'Specials' once again, this time called 'Special Editions' (2002\u2013present), following very similar formats and mixture of types although issued triannually. Panini would go on to launch another set of triannual 'Specials', known as 'Bookazines', a decade or so after that (2013\u2013present).\n\nWith respect to Specials devoted to comic strips and labelled as 'Graphic Novels' in the list above, there were six issued in total. Along with the three Marvel era 'Graphic Novels' (1989-1993) and the ''DWM Classic Comics Autumn Special: Evening\u2019s Empire'' (1993) publication (which appears as a Special of the 'Classic Comics' run) there were ten Marvel era ''DWM'' 'Graphic Novels' overall. These are all listed together for ease in the '''Doctor Who Magazine'' Graphic Novels (1989\u20131993)' subsection below, with the publications belonging to the different 'Specials' and 'Classic Comics' indicated in the table.\n\n=== ''Doctor Who'' Graphic Novels (1980\u20131994) ===\n\nThere were ten publications during the Marvel era that can be considered 'Graphic Novels'. These were six of the 30 ''Doctor Who Magazine'' 'Specials' (1980\u20131996), ''Evening\u2019s Empire'' (1993) which appeared as a 'Special' of the 'Classic Comics' run (1992-1994), and three one-off publications. The term 'Graphic Novel' must be applied loosely here overall, as all but two these publications collect and reprint several comic stories from ''DWM'', although in most cases the stories are related. Furthermore, the two issues that print original stories in full or part are ''The Age of Chaos'' (1994) in the 'Specials' run; and the aforementioned ''Classic Comics Autumn Special: Evening\u2019s Empire'' (1993), which printed a strip begun but never completed in ''Doctor Who Magazine''. Accordingly, the three one-off 'Graphic Novels' are all reprints from ''DWM'', although two of these colourise original black and white strips:\n\n* '''''Doctor Who: Voyager''''' (1989): Collects and reprints four Sixth Doctor stories from the ''DWM'' main comic strip, including the two stories already reprinted in ''Doctor Who Collected Comics'' (''DWM'' 'Specials') three years previous. These appeared in the order of original publication, and all four strips were colourised for the first time.\n\n* '''''Abslom Daak Dalek Killer''''' (1990): Abslom Daak was a character who first appeared in a ''DWM'' secondary strip in the early years of the publication, when still ''Doctor Who Weekly'' (1980). The character returned a couple of times in two related secondary strips later that year, before appearing in the main strip alongside the Seventh Doctor after almost a decade (1989). This volume collects all these stories, as well as having an original short story linking the early three secondary strips with the later main strip appearance. The strips appear here, as they did in their original publication, in black and white.\n\n* '''''Doctor Who: The Mark of Mandragora''''' (1993): A [[Virgin Publishing]] experiment, who were at the time printing the [[Virgin New Adventures]] ''Doctor Who'' novels (1991-1997) starring the Seventh Doctor. Virgin licenced some Seventh Doctor main comic strips from ''DWM'' and published them in a graphic novel entitled ''Doctor Who: Mark of Mandragora'', reprinting stories that originally appeared between 1990-1991, as well as the text story \"Teenage Kicks\" by [[Paul Cornell]] (1990). The strips were colourised.\n\nThe list below displays all ten 'Graphic Novels', although only the contents of the three stand-alone publications are given here.

It is worth noting that in a response to a letter to ''Doctor Who Classic Comics'' (issue 4) in 1993, the designation is a 'one-off', as is the title ''Doctor Who Collected Comics'' (GN-04, directly above).<ref>{{cite journal|date=1993|title = Letters|journal = Doctor Who Classic Comics|issue = 4|page = 51}}</ref> Specials status and date for the latter publication is confirmed in ''Doctor Who Magazine: 500 DWM Issues'' bonus 'Souvenir' publication (free with ''DWM'' issue 500) (2016).<ref name=\"Spilsbury2016-110-111\"/> The inference here is that the inclusion of publications like ''Doctor Who Magazine Collected Comics'' in 'Souvenir' is somewhat arbitrary. However, this is the situation, and ''Doctor Who: Voyager'' does not appear in the Specials list. Indeed, as ''Doctor Who'' comic strip historian John Ainsworth notes ''Doctor Who: Voyager'' is considered the first proper 'Graphic Novel' by ''DWM'' and Marvel.<ref>{{cite journal|date=23 June 1993|title =Behind the Frame|journal = Doctor Who Classic Comics|issue = Issue 8|page = 14}}</ref>\n* '''b''' {{Note|DWM_GraphicNovels_b}} ''Abslom Daak Dalek Killer'', although only having it's title on the cover and in the indicia with no format mentioned, is designated a 'Graphic Album' in advertising. See, for instance, the advert in the ''Doctor Who Magazine Summer Special [1991]''.<ref>{{cite journal|date=1991|title = Summer Special|journal = Doctor Who Magazine|issue = [Special 18]|page=2}}</ref>\n* '''c''' {{Note|DWM_GraphicNovels_c}} ''Doctor Who: The Mark of Mandragora'' is named a 'Graphic Novel' on its cover but not in its indicia, where the Virgin licencing mentions only Marvel and not ''Doctor Who Magazine''. Neither is ''DWM'' mentioned on the credits page, however, the back cover blurb does indeed cite the source material.\n|}\n|}\n\nAfter Marvel sold ''Doctor Who Magazine'' to Panini in 1995, the different formats of Graphic Novels would become much more harmonized with the introduction of the '''Doctor Who'' Comic Strip Collected Editions (2004\u2013present)'. These would reprint ''DWM'' main strips and strips from parallel publications in large A4 editions. The ethos of the 'Collected Editions' was and is to print the stories in their original order and format, in other words, reprinting strips originally produced in black and white as black and white. Accordingly, the Marvel era publications with reprinted but colourised strips generally remains the only way to see these stories in Graphic Novel format. There are exceptions, however. Colourised reprints of the early ''DWM'' black and white strips which had been published in ''Doctor Who'' Marvel Comics USA (1980\u20131986) would appear in ''Doctor Who Classic Comics'' (1992\u20131994), around the same time as the Marvel Graphic Novels. Then, in January 2008 under a Panini licence, [[IDW Publishing]], an American comic book company, would launch ''Doctor Who Classics'', a monthly comic book series reprinting digitally colourised Fourth, Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Doctor strips (2008\u20132014).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=135146 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20070623103614/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=135146 |url-status=dead |archive-date=23 June 2007 |title=IDW Launches Dr. Who Classics in December (press release) |website=[[Newsarama]] |date=3 November 2007}}</ref> The series would go on to be collected in various trade paperbacks, and then some in omnibus editions - both of which can be considered 'Graphic Novels'. However, these are recoloured digitally while the Marvel era were hand-coloured, so the Marvel Graphic Novels retain a certain uniqueness. From later years of ''DWM'' when the strip was colourised (beginning issue 300 in 2001), there were also two Panini era 'Special Editions' (2002\u2013present) that reprinted comic strips for the Ninth Doctor (April 2006) and some of the mid-period Tenth Doctor (April 2008), although these strips went on to also be collected in the 'Collected Editions'.\n\n=== ''DWM'' related ''Doctor Who'' strips (1989-1993) ===\n\nDuring the late 1980s Marvel UK Comics decided to expand its ranges, and created a number of 'experimental' comics.<ref>{{cite book |last2=Gray |first2=Scott|last1=Spilsbury |first1=Tom  |date=2013 |title=\"Hulk Meets Who: Andy Seddon\" in Doctor Who: Nemesis of the Daleks |publisher=Panini |page=185}}</ref> Two of these titles launched toward the end of 1989, both of which were edited by Andy Seddon, featured ''Doctor Who'' content. '''''The Incredible Hulk Presents''''' had an original dedicated stand-alone ''Doctor Who'' comic strip which ran every issue, alongside reprints of other Marvel USA comic strips. The Death's Head situation was far more complex as it was constituted as crossover stories. The already established character of Death's Head featured in a main strip of ''Doctor Who Magazine'', before going on to have its own comic '''''Deaths Head''''' launched where the Doctor went on to appear in one of the stories. Subsequently, Death's Head would return to have another guest appearance in the ''Doctor Who Magazine'' main strip. Both publications suffered poor sales, and were soon cancelled. However, in 1993, all the Death's Head stories, plus those from ''DWM'' featuring Death's Head now specially colourised, were reissued in the pre-planned limited run '''''The Incomplete Death's Head''''' series. The content also included a non-Death's Head ''Doctor Who Magazine'' story (again specially colourised), as well as a newly created coda starring the Doctor in the final pages of the final issue.\n\n==== ''The Incredible Hulk Presents'' (1989) ====\n\n''The Incredible Hulk Presents'' was a short-lived weekly comic from Marvel UK. It launched in September 1989 with issue 1, and lasted twelve issues in total. It reprinted stories from US Marvel Comics' ''The Incredible Hulk'' from the 1970s; ''G.I. Joe: Special Missions'' (retitled for the UK as ''Action Force'', later ''G.I. Joe the Action Force''); and an Indiana Jones strip reprinting Marvel US adaptations of ''Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade'' and further ''Indiana Jones'' adventures. All the reprinted US strips were in colour. The only original content was the ''Doctor Who'' strip, which was, however, produced in black and white.<ref>{{cite book |last2=Gray |first2=Scott|last1=Spilsbury |first1=Tom  |date=2013 |title=\"Hulk Meets Who: A Strange Liaison\" in Doctor Who: Nemesis of the Daleks |publisher=Panini |page=184}}</ref> This strip featured ten adeventures (with two two-parters) of the Seventh Doctor.\n\nThe 'intention (unbeknownst to the editor of ''Doctor Who Magazine'') [was] that the strips would also run in ''DWM''. When he found out, John Freeman took issue with the plan, arguing that while the strips had merit for the intended younger audience ''IHP'' was aimed at, they were inappropriate for ''DWM'', which was trying to tailor more for ''Doctor Who'' fans, instead of the mainstream audience previous editors had aimed for'.<ref>{{cite book |last2=Gray |first2=Scott|last1=Spilsbury |first1=Tom  |date=2013 |title=\"Hulk Meets Who: A Strange Liaison\" in Doctor Who: Nemesis of the Daleks |publisher=Panini |page=184}}</ref> Freeman's argument was eventually accepted by Marvel UK as sales figures of ''DWM'' improved under his leadership; albeit with two exceptions. The two part strip \"Hunger at the Ends of Time!\" from issues 2 and 3 of ''IHP'' was reprinted in ''DWM'' issues 157 and 158 (February - March, 1990); and the one unpublished strip completed for ''IHP'' issue 13 before the publication was cancelled, \"Doctor Conkerer!\", which appeared in ''DWM'' issue 162 (July 1990).<ref>{{cite book |last2=Gray |first2=Scott|last1=Spilsbury |first1=Tom  |date=2013 |title=\"Hulk Meets Who: A Strange Liaison\" in Doctor Who: Nemesis of the Daleks |publisher=Panini |page=184}}</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=\"border:none\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"|List of ''The Incredible Hulk Presents Doctor Who'' strips\n|-\n|style=\"padding:0;border:none\"|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|'''#''' || '''Comic Title''' ||'''Date''' || '''Doctor Who strip''' || '''References'''\n|-\n\n| 01 || ''The Incredible Hulk Presents'' || 7 October 1989 || \"Once In A Lifetime\" || IHP<ref>{{cite journal|date=7 October 1989|title =Banner Headlines|journal = The Incredible Hulk Presents|issue = Issue 1|page=2}}</ref>\n|-\n| 02 || ''The Incredible Hulk Presents'' || 14 October 1989 || \"Hunger at the Ends of Time!\" Part 1 || IHP<ref>{{cite journal|date=14 October 1989|title =Banner Headlines|journal = The Incredible Hulk Presents|issue = Issue 2|page=2}}</ref>\n|-\n| 03 || ''The Incredible Hulk Presents'' || 21 October 1989 || \"Hunger at the Ends of Time!\" Part 2 || IHP<ref>{{cite journal|date=21 October 1989|title =Banner Headlines|journal = The Incredible Hulk Presents|issue = Issue 3|page=2}}</ref>\n|-\n| 04 || ''The Incredible Hulk Presents'' || 28 October 1989 || \"War World\" || IHP<ref>{{cite journal|date=28 October 1989|title =Banner Headlines|journal = The Incredible Hulk Presents|issue = Issue 4|page=2}}</ref>\n|-\n| 05 || ''The Incredible Hulk Presents'' || 4 November 1989 || \"Technical Hitch\" || IHP<ref>{{cite journal|date=4 November 1989|title =Banner Headlines|journal = The Incredible Hulk Presents|issue = Issue 5|page=2}}</ref>\n|-\n| 06 || ''The Incredible Hulk Presents'' || 11 November 1989 || \"A Switch in Time\" || IHP<ref>{{cite journal|date=11 November 1989|title =Banner Headlines|journal = The Incredible Hulk Presents|issue = Issue 6|page=2}}</ref>\n|-\n| 07 || ''The Incredible Hulk Presents'' || 18 November 1989 || \"The Sentinel!\" || IHP<ref>{{cite journal|date=18 November 1989|title =Banner Headlines|journal = The Incredible Hulk Presents|issue = Issue 7|page=2}}</ref>\n|-\n| 08 || ''The Incredible Hulk Presents'' || 25 November 1989 || \"Who's That Girl!\" Part 1 || IHP<ref>{{cite journal|date=25 November 1989|title =Banner Headlines|journal = The Incredible Hulk Presents|issue = Issue 8|page=2}}</ref>\n|-\n| 09 || ''The Incredible Hulk Presents'' || 2 December 1989 || \"Who's That Girl!\" Part 2 || IHP<ref>{{cite journal|date=2 December 1989|title =Banner Headlines|journal = The Incredible Hulk Presents|issue = Issue 9|page=2}}</ref>\n|-\n| 10 || ''The Incredible Hulk Presents'' || 9 December 1989 || \"The Enlightenment of Ly-Chee the Wise\"  || IHP<ref>{{cite journal|date=9 December 1989|title =Banner Headlines|journal = The Incredible Hulk Presents|issue = Issue 10|page=2}}</ref>\n|-\n| 11 || ''The Incredible Hulk Presents'' || 16 December 1989 || \"Slimmer\"  || IHP<ref>{{cite journal|date=16 December 1989|title =Banner Headlines|journal = The Incredible Hulk Presents|issue = Issue 11|page=2}}</ref>\n|-\n| 12 || ''The Incredible Hulk Presents'' || 23 December 1989 || \"Ninevah!\"  || IHP<ref>{{cite journal|date=23 December 1989|title =Banner Headlines|journal = The Incredible Hulk Presents|issue = Issue 12|page=2}}</ref>\n|-\n\n|}\n|}\n\nAndy Seddon, editor of ''IHP'', says that the comic folded quite quickly as 'a result of poor sales. I think everyone involved at the editorial level didn't think it was a coherent offering'.<ref>{{cite book |last2=Gray |first2=Scott|last1=Spilsbury |first1=Tom  |date=2013 |title=\"Hulk Meets Who: Andy Seddon\" in Doctor Who: Nemesis of the Daleks |publisher=Panini |page=186}}</ref> As well as the reprint and re-purposing of the two strips mentioned above, four of the strips were soon reprinted in ''Doctor Who Classic Comics'' (1992\u20131994) - beginning with issue 21 (June 1992) - now specially colourised (see below). Eventually, all the strips (including the re-purposed ''IHP'' issue 13 strip printed in ''DWM'' 162) were reissued in original black and white in the Collected Edition ''Doctor Who: Nemesis of the Daleks'' (2013).\n\n==== ''Death's Head'' & ''Incomplete Death's Head'' (1989-1993) ====\n\nThe character of [[Death's Head]] was a giant robotic bounty hunter created by writer Simon Furman for the Marvel UK's [[The Transformers (Marvel Comics)|''The Transformers'']] comic. According to Furman, Death's Head was simply a 'throwaway character' which would 'be discarded down the line (probably at the end of the first story arc)'.<ref name=\"vol1intro\">Furman, Simon (2006). \"Freelance Peacekeeping Agent Open For Business (or how Death's Head came to be)\", ''Death's Head Volume 1'', Panini Publishing, {{ISBN|1-905239-34-3}}</ref> However, when artist Geoff Senior showed Furman the initial character designs, both agreed Death's Head had potential beyond his planned transitory appearance.<ref name=\"vol1intro\"/> To avoid [[Hasbro]] claiming ownership of the character as a consequence of the ''Transformers'' copyright terms agreed with Marvel, Death's Head had to make his debut in another Marvel comic before appearing in ''Transformers''.<ref name=\"vol1intro\"/> Accordingly, Furman wrote a single-page \"Death's Head\" strip that has become known as \"High Noon Tex\", illustrated by [[Bryan Hitch]]). In this short strip, Death's Head was a noir-ish contract killer of human proportions (thus anticipating the character's size and occupation post-''Transformers'' appearances). The idea was that the strip would be published in a number of Marvel UK titles prior to appearing in ''The Transformers'' - although their is no evidence of any such an early publications. Death's Head made his debut as the giant robotic bounty hunter in the weekly ''The Transformers'' comic beginning with issue 113 (16 May 1987), and appearing during this initial run in 13 issues in total: #114, #117-#119, #133-#134, and #146-#151 (ending 6 February 1988). \n\n'''First Doctor Who crossover: ''Doctor Who Magazine''''' - The character's first association with ''Doctor Who'' happened in the April 1998 edition of ''Doctor Who Magazine'' (issue 135) in the Seventh Doctor main strip '''\"The Crossroads of Time\"'''. In this story the Doctor and Death's Head clashed, the former reducing the latter from a giant robot to human size with 'one of the Master's Tissue Compression Eliminators!,' before sending him to Earth. \n\nDeath's Head then made a guest appearance in Marvel UK's ''Dragon's Claws'' issue 5 (November 1988) in a strip titled \"Watch Out Dragon's Claws - Here's Death's Head\". After these guest appearances, Marvel Comics UK launched the full colour USA size-format ''Death's Head'' in December 1988. The publication was issued monthly, with each edition featuring one long comic strip story starring Death's Head. \n\n'''Second Doctor Who crossover: ''Death's Head''''' - It was during the ''Death's Head'' comic run that the Seventh Doctor appeared as a central antagonist. In issue 8 (July 1989), the story '''\"Time Bomb!\"''' (not to be confused with a ''DWM'' Sixth Doctor story of the same name) saw the Doctor with a bounty on his head. Death's Head picks up the contract from a long term ''Doctor Who Magazine'' character and adversary to the Doctor, uber-capitalist Josiah W. Dogbolter. \n\nDespite the first issue of ''Death's Head'' comic prompting a letter from Stan Lee praising the character and creative team, the publication soon folded. This was reported to be a consequence of distribution problems and the comic being of a smaller size causing it to be obscured by larger comics on the shelf. The ''Death's Head'' publication was cancelled at issue 10 (September 1989). The following year, Death's Head returned in the ''Fantastic Four'' comic (issue 338; March 1990), with a story titled \"Kangs for the Memories!!! Or Guess Who's Coming to Diner\". Later the same year Death's Head featured in an ongoing story called \"The Body in Question\" in Marvel's short lived ''[[Strip (comics)|Strip]]'' comic. Beginning in issue 13 (August 1990) and ending in the final issue of the publication (November 1990) the story was later republished as a Death's Head graphic novel ''Death's Head: The Body in Question'' (1991). This strip not only resolved the cliffhanger at the end of the cancelled ''Death's Head'' series, but also outlined an origin story (although confusingly, perhaps, Death's Head was human sized prior to his confrontation with the Doctor). Death's Head then popped up in ''The Sensational She-Hulk'' (issue 24; February 1991) with the story \"Priceless\", and in a short stand-alone strip in ''Marvel Comics Presents'' (issue 76; March 1991) with \"The Deadliest Game\". \n\n'''Third Doctor Who crossover: ''Doctor Who Magazine''''' - In May 1991, Death's Head featured in a cameo role in the ''Doctor Who Magazine'' main strip in a story called '''\"Party Animals\"''' (issue 173). In the story, the Seventh Doctor attends a party populated by a number of his foes, and witnesses a bar fight explode, in which Death's Head plays a contributing factor.\n\nThis was essentially the end of original stories in Death's Head initial run. However, the character was rebooted as Death's Head II for inclusion in Marvel UK's next wave of titles. Commissioned by the new editor [[Paul Neary]], ''Death's Head II'' replaced the original character with a new version created by [[Dan Abnett]], [[Andy Lanning]], and [[Liam Sharp]]. In an autumn 1992 interview with ''Comic World'', Neary was dismissive about the original character, saying 'I didn't think there was much future in Transformers-style robots and I thought we could do an awful lot better.\" He produced some sample sketches of how he wanted the character to look, and Liam Sharp's demo artwork gave the project 'a kickstart'.<ref>[http://starlogged.blogspot.co.uk/2013/11/1992-deaths-head-ii-interview-in-comic.html scans of Comic World #8 at \"Starlogged: 1992: DEATH'S HEAD II INTERVIEW In COMIC WORLD MAGAZINE\"] (13th November 2013)</ref> ''Death's Head II'' launched with issue 1 in March 1992, and ran for four monthly issues.\n\n'''Fourth Doctor Who crossover: ''The Incomplete Death's Head''''' - Death's Head II was an immediate success, which meant Neary was ordered to create more titles. The simplest way to do this quickly was to reprint the original ''Death's Head'' comic series. The job was given to editor John Freeman. 'Paul was ordered to come up with more Death's Head titles,' said Freeman 'and the easiest way to do that was to reprint the original series. That didn't mean he liked it... I suggested the \"wraparound story\" featuring DHII to help convince him'.<ref>[http://starlogged.blogspot.co.uk/2013/11/1992-deaths-head-ii-interview-in-comic.html?showComment=1396026038197#c7543124516161125598 John Freeman's comment at Starlogged, 28th March 2014]</ref> The series - which ran for twelve issues - was called ''The Incomplete Death's Head'' (January - December 1993). However, it did not only repeat the original series, but also included a number of other Death's Head strips from Marvel publications, pretty much in order of release, the exception being ''The Transformers'' stories and ''The Body in Question'' series. Accordingly, the twelve issues of ''The Incomplete Death's Head'' included everything else from \"High Noon Tex\" through to the ''Marvel Comics Presents'' story \"The Deadliest Game\", as well as beginning (issue 1) and ending (issue 12) with the two ''Doctor Who Magazine'' strips '''\"The Crossroads of Time\"''' and '''\"Party Animals\"''' - now colourised from their original black and white. Strangely, the publication also incorporated a non-Death's Head story early-run (issues 4 and 5), the ''Doctor Who Magazine'' comic strip '''\"Keepsake\"''' (''DWM'' 140; September 1988) once again starring the Seventh Doctor, and once again colourised. This was possible due to way the whole series was framed with the wraparounds, with Death's Head II witnessing these past events in an effort to learn more about his original incarnation. In this way, the Doctor's status of arch-nemesis of the original Death's Head is heightened even before '''\"Time Bomb\"''' appears in issue 9 - the only original ''Death's Head'' series strip featuring the Doctor. Indeed, the final few pages of the final issue - as an '''untitled coda''' - have a fourth encounter with the Doctor, specially produced for the publication.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=\"border:none\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"|List of ''Doctor Who'' and ''Death's Head'' crossovers\n|-\n|style=\"padding:0;border:none\"|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|'''#''' || '''Publication''' ||'''Issue''' ||'''Date''' || '''Story''' || '''Production''' || '''Notes'''\n|-\n\n| 01 || ''Doctor Who Magazine'' ||135 ||Apr 1998 || \"The Crossroads of Time\" || Black and white || Original\n|-\n\n| 02 || ''Death's Head'' ||8||Jul 1989 || \"Time Bomb!\"{{ref label|DH_a1|a|}} || Colour || Original\n|-\n\n| 03 || ''Doctor Who Magazine'' ||173||May 1991 || \"Party Animals\" || Black and white || Original\n|-\n\n| 04 || ''The Incomplete Death's Head'' ||1||Jan 1993 || \"The Crossroads of Time\" || Colour || Reprint - Colourised - of #01\n|-\n\n| 05 || ''The Incomplete Death's Head'' \n|4\n|Apr 1993 \n| \"Keepsake\" (part 1) \n| Colour \n| rowspan=\"2\" |Reprint - Colourised - of ''DWM'' mainstrip issue 140 (Sep 1988){{ref label|DH_b|b|}}\n|-\n\n| 06 \n| ''The Incomplete Death's Head'' \n|5\n|May 1993 \n| \"Keepsake\" (part 2) \n| Colour \n|-\n\n| 07 || ''The Incomplete Death's Head'' ||9||Sep 1993 || \"Time Bomb!\"{{ref label|DH_a2|a|}} || Colour || Reprint of #02\n|-\n\n| 08 || ''The Incomplete Death's Head'' ||12||Dec 1993 || \"Party Animals\" || Colour || Reprint - Colourised - of #03\n|-\n\n| 09 || ''The Incomplete Death's Head'' ||12||Dec 1993 || Untitled coda || Colour || Original\n|-\n\n| colspan=\"7\" style=\"text-align:left; font-size:10pt;\"| Notes<br />\n{{refbegin}}\n* '''a''' {{Note|DH_a1}}{{Note|DH_a2}} \"Time Bomb!\" should not to be confused with a ''Doctor Who Magazine'' Sixth Doctor story of approximately the same name: \"Time Bomb\" (''DWM'' issues 114-116; July - September 1986)\n* '''b''' {{Note|DH_b}} Death's Head does not feature in-strip in \"Keepsake\", but the story is incorporated due to the narrative wraparound used throughout the ''Incomplete Death's Head'' series.\n|}\n|}\n\nIn summary, all of the ''Doctor Who'' and ''Death's Head'' material is included in ''The Incomplete Death's Head'' series and subsequent graphic novel in colourised form. However, as of 2020, the ''Death's Head'' / ''Incomplete Death's Head'' comic strip of \"Time Bomb!\" and the Untitled coda comic strip of ''Incomplete Death's Head'' has yet to be reprinted in the ''DWM'' Collected Editions series. The original ''DWM'' strips have all been repetrinted - in their original black and white and not their ''Incomplete Death's Head'' colourised form - in ''A Cold Day in Hell'' (2009) (\"The Crossroads of Time\" & \"Keepsake\") and ''The Good Soldier'' (2015) (\"Party Animals\").\n\nThe Death's Head character, post ''Doctor Who'' crossover, would go on to have [[Death's Head|numerous further adventures]] continuing as Death's Head II and then as a third incarnation, Death's Head 3.0, once again created by original Death's Head writer Simon Furman.\n\n=== ''Doctor Who Classic Comics'' (1992\u20131994) ===\n\nBetween 1992 and 1994, Marvel UK published ''Doctor Who Classic Comics''. The aim was, as editor Gary Russell stated in the Editorial of the first issue, 'to reproduce every one of the ''Doctor Who'' strips produced in Britain'.<ref>{{cite journal|date=9 December 1992|title =Editorial|journal = Doctor Who Classic Comics|issue = [Issue 1]|page = 2}}</ref> In the end, the publication only ran for 27 monthly issues, with an additional mid-run 'Autumn Special' in 1993. Over the 27 issues, the publication reprinted strips predominately from the early Polystyle ''Doctor Who'' comic strip and the early ''TV Century 21'' Dalek comic strip, but also from a number of sources including, later in the run, ''DWM'' itself. As well as reprints, the 'Autumn Special' featured the comic strip \"Evening's Empire\", an unfinished story from ''DWM'' issue 180, here completed for the first time. \"Evening's Empire\", accordingly, can be seen as a 'Graphic Novel' and essentially as the only original strip of the publication. The sources were:\n\n*'''''Polystyle''''' comic strip (1964-1979): reprinting selected stories from the First, Second, Third, and Fourth Doctors originally printed in ''TV Comic'' (#674-999 [1964-1971]); ''Countdown'' (#1-39 [1971]); ''Countdown for TV Action'' (#40-56 [1971-1972]); ''TV Action in Countdown'' (#57-58 [1972]); ''TV Action + Countdown'' (#59-100 [1972-1973]); ''TV Action'' (#101-131 [1973]); ''TV Comic + TV Action'' (#1133-1147 [1973]); ''TV Comic'' (#1148-1181 [1973-1974]);  ''TV Comic plus Tom & Jerry Weekly'' (#1182-1201 [1974]); ''TV Comic'' (#1202-1291 [1974-1976]); ''Mighty TV Comic'' (#1292-1352 [1976-1977]); ''TV Comic'' (#1353-1392 [1977-1978]); ''TV Comic with Target'' (#1393-1401 [1978]); and ''TV Comic'' (#1402-1430 [1978-1979]); as well as one strip from an associated annual: ''TV Comic Annual 1976'' (1975). Some of these stories were originally in colour; some in part colour (for example one page was colour, the rest of the pages black and white); or in black and white. For ''DWCC'' all original black and white pages were colourised.\n\n*'''''TV Century 21''''' comic strip (1965-1967): reprinting Dalek stories which had been 'a huge success' in DWCC's 'sister publication, ''Doctor Who Magazine''' and were 'transferred... to give... more space to re-present them'.<ref>{{cite journal|date=9 December 1992|title =Editorial|journal = Doctor Who Classic Comics|issue = [Issue 1]|page = 3}}</ref> The strip was presented in its original colour format, and ran from issue 1 almost every week, completing in issue 19 (April 1994). \n\n*'''''Dell Movie Classics''''' comic strip (December 1966): a one-off American publication (in the ''Dell Movie Classic'' series) featuring a story called ''Dr. Who and the Daleks'' with the [[Peter Cushing|Aaru Doctor (alternative First Doctor played by Peter Cushing)]]. This was an adaptation of the ''[[Dr. Who and the Daleks]]'' film from 1965, in turn adapted from the ''Doctor Who'' television serial \"[[The Daleks]]\" from 1963-4.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-590\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 590</ref> The reprint appeared in its entirety in ''DWCC'' issue 9. Printed in original colour.\n\n*'''''Doctor Who Magazine''''' comic strip (1979-1991): ''DWCC'' reprinted mostly main strips from the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Doctors; as well as completing the Seventh Doctor story \"Evening's Empire\" in the mid-run 'Autumn Special' (September 1993). The ''DWM'' main strip reprints began in ''DWCC'' issue 9 (July 1993) with a Fourth Doctor story. ''DWCC'' also reprinted some ''DWM'' secondary strips (essentially Doctorless), beginning in issue 23. All were originally in black and white (barring two pages of the Fifth Doctor story 'The Tides of Time' - ''DWM'' issue 66), and were specially colourised for ''DWCC'' (even when some had previously been colourised for reprints in ''Doctor Who'' Comics USA [1980\u20131986]).\n\n*'''''The Incredible Hulk Presents''''' comic strip (1989): a short run of a parallel Seventh Doctor strip in the short-lived ''The Incredible Hulk Presents'' comic. It launched in September 1989 with issue 1, and lasted twelve issues in total. It reprinted stories from US Marvel Comics' ''The Incredible Hulk'' from the 1970s; ''G.I. Joe: Special Missions'' (retitled for the UK as ''Action Force'', later ''G.I. Joe the Action Force''); and an ''Indiana Jones'' strip reprinting Marvel US adaptations of ''Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade'' and further Indiana Jones adventures. All these US strips were in colour. The ''Doctor Who'' strip, however, was in black and white. One story was later printed in ''DWM'', Hunger from the Ends of Time!; and one unpublished strip, ''Doctor Conkerer!'', was produced for the unprinted issue #13 later being printed in ''DWM'' 162. ''DWCC'' reprinted only four of the early stories, over three issues beginning in issue 21. All four one-part strips were colourised.\n\nThe comic strips in ''Doctor Who Classic Comics'' were presented in full colour, meaning strips were colourised when not originally released in colour.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=\"border:none\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"|List of ''Doctor Who'' Classic Comics\n|-\n|style=\"padding:0;border:none\"|\n{|

Other projects beckon for us'.<ref>{{cite journal|date=7 December 1994|title =Contents|journal = Doctor Who Classic Comics|issue = Issue 27|page = 3}}</ref> With this final issue, ''DWCC'' completed the full run of the ''Countdown'' / ''TV Action'' run (excluding specials and annuals) during the mid-period of the Polystyle Third Doctor strips, before the strips left and then returned to ''TV Comic''. However, of the two ''TV Comic'' periods (First, Second, half of the Third, and Fourth Doctors), only 32 of the potential 152 strips were ever reprinted (just over 20%). The situation was even worse with respect to the fifteen or so years of ''Doctor Who Magazine'' strips and (admitted far, far shorter run) of ''The Incredible Hulk Presents'' strips. That the publication was terminated for reasons other than having completed the Third Doctor ''Countdown'' / ''TV Action'' strips is the fact that the ongoing \"Vworp Vworp\" articles, which were printing a chronology of ''Doctor Who'' comic strips with short synopses, only reached then end of the Third Doctor Polystyle period.\n\n=== ''Doctor Who Yearbooks'' (1992\u20131996) ===\n\nBetween 1992 and 1996 Marvel UK published a number of ''Doctor Who Yearbooks'' \u2013 essentially annuals \u2013 containing articles, comic strips, and short fiction. These continued the tradition of ''Doctor Who Annuals'' that had been issued under a separate licence from the BBC by [[World Distributors (Manchester) Ltd|World Distributors]] between 1965 and 1985 (for the years 1966 to 1986); renaming themselves World International, Ltd. in 1981, but due to falling sales limiting their publishing activities before ceasing trading later that decade.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://comicvine.gamespot.com/world-distributors/4010-3225/|title=Comic Vine: World Distributors (Manchester) Ltd|accessdate=25 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=\"border:none\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"|List of ''Doctor Who Yearbooks''\n|-\n|style=\"padding:0;border:none\"|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|'''Yb#''' || '''Title''' ||'''Date''' || '''Pages''' || '''Fiction''' || '''Articles''' \n|-\n\n| 01 \n| '''''Doctor Who Yearbook''''' [1992] \n| October 1991 \n| 64 \n| \nComic strips:\n* \"Under Pressure\" (7D, 4D & 3D) \n''Brief Encounter'' short stories:\n* \"The Meeting\" (1D) <small>[Reprint from ''DWM'' #167]</small>\n* \"Future Imperfect\" (2D & 3D)\n* \"Time on a Vine\" (5D)\n* \"The Deal\" (6D) \n| \n*\"Where it All Began\" \n*\"The Doctor Ordered\" \n*\"The Complete Guide\" \n*\"Behind the Scenes\" (TV: \"The Curse of Fenric\")\n*\"First Call\" (TV: \"The Curse of Fenric\")\n|-\n\n| 02 \n| '''''Doctor Who Yearbook 1993''''' \n| September 1992 \n| 64 \n| \nComic strips:\n* \"Metamorphosis\" (7D)\n''Brief Encounter'' short stories:\n* \"Cambridge Previsited\" (1D)\n* \"Dream a Little Dream for Me\" (2D &7D)\n* \"Country of the Blind\" (3D)\n* \"Farewells\" (4D)\n* \"Encounter on Burnt Snake Flat\" (5D)\n* \"A Tourist Invasion\" (6D) \n| \n* \"Spearheads From Space\" (invaders)\n* \"Daggers of the Mind\" (manipulators)\n* \"Making (New) Myths\" \n* \"The Sonic Screwdriver\"y \n* \"Collectors Corner: The Silly Season\" (novelty merchandise) \n* \"Terrible Tunes\" (music merchandise)\n* \"Dressing Up\" (clothing merchandise)\n* \"Monster files\"\n* \"A4 Schematics\" \n|-\n\n| 03 \n| '''''Doctor Who Yearbook 1994''''' \n| September 1993 \n| 64 \n| \nComic strips:\n*\"A Religious Experience\" (1D & 7D)\n*\"Rest and Re-Creation\" (4D)\nShort stories:\n*\"Loop the Loup\" (2D)\n*\"Reconnaissance\" (3D)\n*\"The Changeling Years\" (4D)\n*\"Perfect Day\" (5D)\n*\"The More Things Change\" (6D)\n*\"Pulling Strings\" (7D) \n| \n*\"The Unknown Forest\" (high-brow perception)\n*\"Andrew Pixley's WhoFax\" (trivia) \n*\"Thirty Years of Doctor Who in Fiction\" \n*\"Thirty Years of Doctor Who in Fact\"\n|-\n\n| 04 \n| '''''Doctor Who Yearbook 1995''''' \n| September 1994 \n| 64 \n| \nComic strips:\n*\"The Naked Flame\" (4D)\n*\"Blood Invocation\" (5D)\nShort stories:\n*\"Urrozdinee\" (1D)\n*\"Briefly Noted\" (2D)\n*\"The Hungry Bomb\" (3D)\n*\"Rescue\" (Doctorless)\n*\"The Beast Inside\" (4D)\n*\"One Last Try\" (5D)\n*\"Work is Hell\" (6D)\n*\"Blood Invocation\" (5D)\n*\"It's Only a Game\" (7D) \n| \n*\"Retrospective: 30 Years in the TARDIS\"\n*\"Retrospective: ''The Paradise of Death''\" (audio)\n*\"Retrospective: ''Dimensions in Time''\" (TV) \n|-\n\n| 05 \n| '''''Doctor Who Yearbook 1996''''' \n| September 1995 \n| 96 \n| \nComic strips:\n*\"Star Beast II\" (4D)\n*\"Junkyard Demon II\" (4D) \n| \n*\"A Brief History of Space and Time\" (season guide) \n*\"The Nineties\"\n*\"Valley of the Lost\" (summary of unmade TV story)\n|-\n\n|}\n|}\n\n=== ''Doctor Who Poster Magazine'' (1994\u20131996) ===\n\nBetween 1994 and 1996 Marvel UK published a number of ''Doctor Who Poster Magazines'', produced in full colour with visual image based articles, each with a specific theme.

These are stand alone magazines themed around a specific topic and carrying a much higher page count than the regular magazine. Over the run, so far, there have been eight themes:\n\n*'''Doctor Who eras''' (2002\u20132014): These issues explored the stories in a Doctor's era, sometimes over a number of 'volumes'. This theme was named '''The Complete x Doctor''' for the classic series, and '''The Doctor Who Companion''' for the post-2005 series \u2013 although the last two of these have different names, the ''Official Guide'' covering the final part of the Eleventh Doctor's final season (April 2014), and ''The Year of the Doctor'' 50th Anniversary edition (August 2014). This strand of the \"Special Editions\" came to an end with these two releases, but is continued in the rebooted \"Bookazine\" series as of 2019 with the Twelfth Doctor.\n\n*'''Anniversaries''' (2003\u2013): Beginning with ''We Love Doctor Who'' (November 2003), celebrating the 40th anniversary of the first broadcast of the TV show, the Special Editions have marked all the major milestones of the programme. In the case of the 50th Anniversary edition (August 2014), this publication also had the function of being the final part of the ''Doctor Who eras'' thematic, which post-2005 was labelled '''The Doctor Who Companion''' (in all but this and the penultimate instalment, tagged an ''Official Guide'').\n\n*'''In Their Own Words''' (2005\u20132010): An overview of the programme's history produced chronologically. This series collected excerpts from interviews with ''Doctor Who'' cast and crew over the years 1963 to 2009. The series concluded in 2010.\n\n*'''Comic strip reprints''' (2006\u20132008): The Special Editions became the reprint format for the main comic strip for the Ninth Doctor (April 2006) and some of the mid-period Tenth Doctor (April 2008). These strips were, however, also collected in the Collected Edition format (2004\u2013present) in ''The Cruel Sea'' (2014) for the Ninth Doctor; and ''The Widow's Curse'' (2009, Collected Tenth Doctor Comic Strips Volume 2).\n\n*'''Missing Episodes''' (2013): The three 2013 Special Editions published Telesnaps from missing episodes from the Hartnell and Troughton eras.\n\n*'''Sarah Jane Adventures''' (2009\u20132012): Three special editions between 2009 and 2012 covering the production of the \"Doctor Who\" television spin-off \"The Sarah Jane Adventures\".\n\n*'''Yearbooks''' (2015\u2013): Beginning with the 2015 Yearbook (December 2014), these publications are issued once a year looking back over the previous year in ''Doctor Who''.\n\n*'''Topics''' (2015\u2013): In the wake of the first \"Doctor Who Yearbook\" (2015; published December 2014), the \"Special Editions\" devoted the other two releases of 2015 to specific topics: ''The Art of Doctor Who'' (April 2015) and ''The Music of Doctor Who'' (August 2015). This pattern of a Yearbook followed by two topics has continued to present.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=\"border:none\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"|List of Special Editions\n|-\n|style=\"padding:0;border:none\"|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|'''SE#''' || '''Series#''' || '''Title''' ||'''Date''' || '''Pages''' || '''Contents''' || '''References'''\n|-\n\n| 01 || C-01 || The Complete Fifth Doctor || March 2002 || 68 || A detailed look at the complete run of [[Fifth Doctor]] stories and their various spin offs.

These Collected Editions have not always been published in the order of original publication in ''Doctor Who Weekly/Magazine'' and its ''Yearbooks'', ''Specials'' and associated publications. Panini have published two or three of these Collected Editions each year from 2004 to 2019, except 2010 and 2011 when the Collected Editions were put on hold for reasons unknown.\n\nAs of December 2019 there have been 29 volumes released, the most recent being ''Ground Zero'', which features strips from the First, Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Seventh Doctors. As Panini have now collected all the main strips up to the end of the Twelfth Doctor continuity, they began focusing upon the 'past Doctors' period of the magazine (1994\u20131996, between the end of the Seventh Doctor continuity and beginning of the Eighth Doctor continuity) and other strips from across its publications throughout the years while they built up enough Thirteenth Doctor strips for a Collected Edition. The first Thirteenth Doctor Collected Edition (volume 30) is due in 2020.\n\nThe list of volumes below is placed in the original order of their publication in ''Doctor Who Magazine'', which parallels the continuity of the television series, except for the 'past Doctors' period (1994\u20131996) when the publication began seeding one-off stories from all the past Doctors from the period prior to and including the Seventh. The Collected Editions with these stories are thus placed between the Seventh and Eighth Doctor continuities, except for irregularities, the most substantial being volume 28 ''The Clockwise War'', which leads with the final strip of the Twelfth Doctor period, but also includes past Doctor stories from the ''Doctor Who Yearbooks'' published between 1994 and 1996. Many of the Collected Edition also feature bonus material, such as specially commissioned commentaries by the authors and artists, and sometimes short stories (the latter taken from ''Doctor Who Magazine'') \u2013 these are signalled in the 'Notes' of the below table.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=\"border:none\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"|List of Collected Editions\n|-\n|style=\"padding:0;border:none\"|\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n| '''Title''' || '''Doctor''' || '''Comic Strips''' || '''Authors''' || '''Pages''' || '''#''' || '''Published''' || '''ISBN'''\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" | '''The Iron Legion''' {{ref label|Collected_Editions_a|a|}}\n| rowspan=\"5\" | [[Fourth Doctor#Comics|Fourth]] \n| \"The Iron Legion\" (issues 1\u20138)\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Story [[Pat Mills]];

Launched in 1979 as ''Doctor Who Weekly'', the magazine became a monthly publication the following year. Now with 13 issues a year, as well as currently producing triannual deluxe Special Editions (2002\u2013) and Bookazines (2013\u2013), the publication features behind the scenes articles on the TV show and other media, as well as producing its own world famous comic strip. Its founding editor was [[Dez Skinn]], and the incumbent editor is Marcus Hearn, who took over from the magazine's longest-serving editor, [[Tom Spilsbury]], in July 2017.<ref name=\"doctorwhomagazine.com\">{{cite web|url=https://doctorwhomagazine.com/a-change-of-editor-for-dwm/|title=Doctor Who Magazine (Online): A Change of Editor for Doctor Who Magazine|accessdate=25 December 2019}}</ref> ''DWM'' is recognised by ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' as the longest running TV tie-in magazine, celebrating 40 years of continuous publication on 11 October 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2013/11/doctor-who-50th-anniversary-the-time-lord\u2019s-world-records-53100|title=Doctor Who 50th anniversary: The Time Lord\u2019s world records|accessdate=5 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nOriginally geared towards children and predominately featuring comic strips, ''DWM'' slowly transformed into a mature magazine, expanding to explore behind-the-scenes aspects of the series and developing the comic strip.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Morris |first1=Jonathan |title=The TARDIS Log! |magazine=Doctor Who Magazine |issue=500 |publisher=Panini UK |date=May 2016 |pages=22\u201331}}</ref> Due to its longevity, it is seen as a source of 'official' and exclusive information, sharing a close relationship with the television production team and the BBC.<ref name=\"Spilsbury2016-3\">Russell T Davies in Spilsbury (2016), p. 3</ref>\n\n=== Marvel Years (1979\u20131995) ===\n\nOfficially licensed by the [[BBC]], the magazine began life as '''''Doctor Who Weekly''''' in 1979, published by the [[Marvel UK|UK arm]] of [[Marvel Comics]].

The [[Indicia (publishing)|indicia]] continued describing the publication as 'Doctor Who Weekly' until issue 48. The cover title changed to '''''Doctor Who Monthly''''' with issue 61, and then to '''''The Official Doctor Who Magazine''''' with issue 85 in February 1984. It became '''''The Doctor Who Magazine''''' with issue 99 in April 1985, and simply '''''Doctor Who Magazine''''' with issue 107 in December 1985. The magazine has remained under that title ever since (although an exception was made for issue 397 in June 2008 when the cover only featured the words '''''Bad Wolf''''' following transmission of the ''Doctor Who'' episode \"[[Turn Left (Doctor Who)|Turn Left]]\" on Saturday 21 June).\n\nDespite the BBC discontinuing production of ''Doctor Who'' in 1989, the magazine continued to be published, providing new adventures in the form of comics. In 1990 the magazine started appearing once every four weeks (13 times a year).\n\n=== Panini Years (1995\u2013present) ===\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Doctor Who Magazine 469.jpg|thumb|left|''Doctor Who Magazine'' Issue 469 (February 2014)]] -->\n\n''DWM'' is now published by [[Panini Comics]], which purchased the title along with the rest of the Marvel UK catalogue in 1995. In 2006, however, it lost its exclusivity when [[BBC Worldwide]] launched its own comic, ''[[Doctor Who Adventures]]'', aimed at a younger audience.\n\nDWM's 400th issue was published in September 2008, and the publication celebrated its 30th anniversary in October 2009.

It was announced on 27 January 2012 that ''Doctor Who Insider'' had ceased publication after nine issues. ''Doctor Who Insider'' returned for a special edition issue in 1 November 2012.\n\nPanini has begun to digitally restore and reprint older ''DWM'' comics in [[#Comic Strip: Collected editions|trade paperback]] format. Twenty-five volumes have been printed so far: two featuring the comics adventures of the [[Fourth Doctor]], one with the adventures of the [[Fifth Doctor]], two featuring the [[Sixth Doctor]], five with the adventures of the [[Seventh Doctor]], four focusing on the [[Eighth Doctor]], one with the adventures of the [[Ninth Doctor]], three featuring the [[Tenth Doctor]], four collecting the adventures of the [[Eleventh Doctor]] and four with the adventures of the [[Twelfth Doctor]]. Panini also published a one-shot magazine-format reprinting of the complete [[Ninth Doctor]] strips in 2006 and most of the [[Tenth Doctor]] and [[Martha Jones]] strips in 2008.

The incumbent editor Gary Russell \u2013 who would go on the produce the [[Big Finish Productions]] ''Doctor Who'' audios dramas from their inception, and to work for [[BBC Wales]] as a Script Editor on the ''Doctor Who'' spin-offs ''[[The Sarah Jane Adventures]]'' and ''[[Torchwood]]'' \u2013 was 'asked to leave'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bigfinish.com/news/news_060709_allchange.shtml\n|title=All Change at Big Finish\n|date=9 July 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060821040334/http://www.bigfinish.com/news/news_060709_allchange.shtml |archivedate = 21 August 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|date=3 September 2006|title = Bride on Time!|journal = Doctor Who Magazine|issue = 373}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Gray |first=Scott |date=2019 |title=\"Commentary: Black Destiny\" in Doctor Who: Ground Zero |publisher=Panini |page=122}}</ref> The editorship was taken over by recently hired comic strip editor, Gary Gillatt.

The ''DWM'' strip thus took over from what has become known as the [[Doctor Who Polystyle comic strip|\u2018Polystyle era\u2019]] (1964-1979) of ''Doctor Who'' comic strips.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-11\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 11</ref> Paul Scoones, an historian of the ''Doctor Who'' comic strip, writes: 'First launched in the pages of ''TV Comic'' in November 1964, the comic strip version of ''Doctor Who'' is just one year younger than the television series on which it is based. The strip appeared almost every week: first in ''TV Comic'', then in ''Countdown'' and ''TV Action'' before returning to ''TV Comic''. All these titles were produced by a company called Polystyle Publications  (formally TV Publications), which held the rights to publish a ''Doctor Who'' comic [strip] until May 1979 when the last instalment of the strip appeared [\u2026] Once relinquished by Polystyle, the rights were soon snapped up by Marvel UK, who created their own ongoing comic [strip]. This new strip [\u2026] continues to this day'.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-11\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 11</ref> The main comic strip features the contemporary television Doctor (beginning with the [[Fourth Doctor]] who was on TV at the time ''DWM'' launched), sometimes with his on-screen companion(s), and sometimes with companion(s) created by the ''DWM'' writers. During some of the period when ''Doctor Who'' was off-air, in the wake of the [[Seventh Doctor]], the ''DWM'' main strip featured stories with all the previous Doctors (1994-1996) but continued with the [[Eighth Doctor]] after the broadcast of the [[Doctor Who (film)|TV movie]] (1996). In 2004, when the series returned to television, showrunner Russell T Davies offered to let ''DWM'' write and publish the official regeneration scene from the Eighth Doctor to the [[Ninth Doctor]]. Although work was done on this storyline, then editor [[Clayton Hickman]] and writer [[Scott Gray (writer)|Scott Gray]] eventually turned down the offer as they felt they couldn't do such an important event justice under the constraints imposed by the TV series' continuity.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Flood |first1=Scott |last1=Gray |authorlink1=Scott Gray (writer) |first2=Gareth |last2=Roberts |authorlink2=Gareth Roberts (writer) |first3=Martin |last3=Geraghty |authorlink3=Martin Geraghty |location=[[Tunbridge Wells]] |publisher=Panini |year=2007 |series=Complete eighth Doctor comic strips |volume=4 |isbn=978-1-905239-65-8 |pages=221\u2013223}}</ref> In October 2018 (issue 531), the main comic strip began featuring the [[Thirteenth Doctor]] in \"The Warmonger\".<ref>{{cite journal|date=October 2018|title = \"The Warmonger\" |journal = Doctor Who Magazine|issue = 531| pages = 47\u201354}}</ref>\n\nAs well as a main strip, ''DWM'' has also featured other comics strips over the years. In its first incarnation as ''Doctor Who Weekly'' the main strip was accompanied by a specially commissioned secondary strip exploring stories from across the Whoniverse, and a tertiary strip of reprints from other Marvel publications. The secondary strip continued with the transformation of the magazine into a monthly publication, finally ending in May 1982 (issue 64), albeit becoming more infrequent over the previous year. A tertiary strip, named 'Tales from the TARDIS', ran in ''Doctor Who Weekly'' until late April 1980 (issue 29). These re-used adaptations of classic works of literary science fiction previously published in [[Marvel Classics Comics]] (USA). In late May 1980 (issue 33), the tertiary strip returned reprinting the \"Dalek Chronicles\" (aka \"Dalek Tapes\"), a strip originally published as a one-pager in ''[[TV Century 21]]'' as \"The Daleks\" (1965-1967). This tertiary Dalek strip ended in September 1982 (issue 68) after completing about half of the original run. Since 1982, other strips have appeared again from time to time. For instance, in the 1990s a [[Cyberman]] one-pager strip was featured on the inside cover (3 August 1994 \u2013 8 May 1996 [issues 215-238]). Titled \"The Cybermen\", the series was set on their home planet of [[Mondas]] prior to the events of the television episode ''[[The Tenth Planet]]'' (1966). The ''TV Century 21'' comic \"The Daleks\" was also resurrected for a short time in 1997 (12 March-30 July [issues 249-254]), drawn in the same style as the 1960s original and continuing the story from where it had left off by showing the [[Dalek]]s attacking Earth. Other than this and since then, secondary and tertiary strips have been as rare as hen's teeth, and usually either one or two episodes.\n\nThe ''DWM'' comic strips were all originally printed in black and white (except with a minor - page-count-wise - exception for two pages of \"The Tides of Time\" [July 1982: issue 66]).<ref>{{cite journal|date=26 May 1993|title =Behind The Frame|journal = Doctor Who Classic Comics|issue = Issue 7|page = 32-33}}</ref> The main strip, beginning in 1979 with the Fourth Doctor story \"The Iron Legion\" (17 October - 5 December [issues 1-8]), began being issued in colour as of issue 300 in 2001 with the Eighth Doctor story \"Ophidius\" (February\u2013May [issues 300-303]). However, as early as December 1980 colourised reprints of the early Fourth Doctor main strip and secondary strips appeared in Marvel USA publications: ''[[Marvel Premiere]]: Doctor Who'' (every two months between December 1980 and June 1981 [issues 57-60]) successfully trialled the concept for an American audience to determine if it would attract enough readers; a ''Doctor Who'' comic series being launched in 1984. The series came to an end with issue 23 in August 1986, having colourised and reprinted all the Fourth Doctor strips and four of the six strips of the [[Fifth Doctor]] era, as well as 24 of the 27 ''DWM'' secondary strip stories originally published between 1979 and 1982. Reprints of the original ''DWM'' strips have also appeared in their original black and white as well as colourised in a dizzying number of formats, especially during the Marvel years (1979\u20131995). These Marvel UK (or Marvel licensed) parallel publications were: ''Doctor Who Magazine Specials'' (1980\u20131996); ''Doctor Who Magazine Graphic Novels'' (1989\u20131993); ''Doctor Who Classic Comics'' (1992\u20131994) and ''Doctor Who Yearbooks'' (1992\u20131996). Many of these publications also printed original strips as well. Another original ''Doctor Who'' strip also appeared in ''The Incredible Hulk Presents'' comic series (1989), and the Doctor appeared as a guest character in the first ''Death's Head'' series (1989; rejigged and reprinted as \"Incomplete Death's Head\" in 1993). Spin-off strips and reprints have become much more limited and much more focused during the Panini Years (1995\u2013present). There was a short-lived original Eighth Doctor strip for the [[Radio Times]] (1996-1997), some original [[Ninth Doctor|Ninth]] and [[Tenth Doctor]] strips in the ''Annual'' and ''Storybooks'' (2006\u20132010), and two sets of reprints of the [[Ninth Doctor]] strips (2006) and some of the [[Tenth Doctor]] strips (2008) in the relaunched and rebranded ''Special Editions'' (2002\u2013present). Returning to the origins of the ''DWM'' main strip, Panini licenced [[IDW Publishing|IDW]], an American comic book company, for new digitalised colour reprints of Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Doctor stories. Beginning in January 2008 and running into 2013, IDW printed its ''Doctor Who Classics'' monthly comic book series, going on to collect the colourised strips into various trade paperbacks and omnibus editions.\n\nNotable writers and artists who have worked on the ''DWM'' comic strips, in all its myriad forms include [[John Wagner]],<ref name=\"ad1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.2000ad.org/thrillpower/classicdoctorwho.html |title=Titan / Panini Graphic novels, collections and trade paperbacks: Doctor Who |website=2000AD |accessdate=1 July 2017}}</ref> [[Pat Mills]],<ref name=\"ad1\" /> [[Alan Moore]], [[Grant Morrison]], [[Dave Gibbons]],<ref name=\"ad1\" /> [[Mike McMahon (comics)|Mike McMahon]], [[John Ridgway (comic artist)|John Ridgway]] and [[Ian Edginton]]. Supporting characters created by such writers for ''DWM'' have even crossed over from the comic to other spin-off media include [[Frobisher (Doctor Who)|Frobisher]], the shape-changing companion of the [[Sixth Doctor|Sixth]] and [[Seventh Doctor|Seventh]] Doctors who would appear in [[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish]] audios; [[Abslom Daak]], the [[Dalek]] Killer; the [[Special Executive]], who would later appear in Marvel's ''[[Captain Britain]]''; and the villainous [[Beep the Meep]].\n\nDuring the mid-2000s, in the wake of the successful return of ''Doctor Who'' to television, the BBC began offering multiple comic strip publishing licences effectively ending the monopoly held by ''DWM'' since they had taken over where Polystyle had left off. In 2006, the [[partwork]] publishers [[GE Fabbri]] acquired the license to produce ''[[Doctor Who \u2013 Battles in Time]]'', a fortnightly magazine with a [[Collectible card game|trading card game]] and its own ''Doctor Who'' comic strip. The final issue (number 70) was released on 13 May 2009. Around the same time, [[Immediate Media Company|IMC]] launched ''[[Doctor Who Adventures]]'', its comic strip and features aimed at 6 to 13-year-olds, a younger demographic than the ''DWM'' readership. Initially published every fortnight, from 2008 it went weekly, returning to fortnightly in May 2013, then monthly in 2014. In April 2015, the title was purchased by Panini, the publishers of ''DWM'', who rebooted the publication beginning again with issue 1, changing it to bi-monthly in late 2016. On 19 June 2017, Panini confirmed that publication of the magazine was to be paused after issue 24.<ref>{{cite news|title=Doctor Who Adventures To Pause Publication|url=http://www.doctorwhonews.net/2017/06/doctor-who-adventures-to-pause.html|accessdate=29 July 2017|publisher=Doctor Who News|date=19 June 2017}}</ref> A special one-off edition was released in January 2019. Finally, IDW - who were reprinting early ''DWM'' strips in their ''Doctor Who Classics'' series - launched a parallel range of ongoing comics featuring the Tenth Doctor in early 2008. Over the next six years, until the end of 2013, there were series and ones-shots featuring the Tenth then Eleventh Doctor, even producing a cross over with \"[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]] / Doctor Who : Assimilation2\". IDW ceded their license to [[Titan Publishing Group|Titan]] in 2014, who have since created a complex number of parallel ''Doctor Who'' series for both nu-''Who'' and classic Doctors. Titan have collected the IDW and Titan comics into various format collectors editions, scaling back production since the beginning of the Thirteenth Doctor era.\n\nDespite the competition of ''Battles in Time'', ''Doctor Who Adventures'', and the IDW/Titan series, ''DWM'' and its main comic strip has continued unabated. A sign of its rude health is that Panini continue to publish the ongoing ''Doctor Who Comic Strip Collected Editions'' which began in 2004. Over the subsequent years the ''Collected Editions'' have reprinted all the ''Doctor Who'' main strips in their original size (A4) and format (ie, black and white for ''DWM'' issues 1-299), as well as many secondary, tertiary, and parallel publication strips. As of December 2019 there have been 29 volumes released, with the first ''Thirteenth Doctor Collected Edition'' (volume 30) due in 2020.\n\n=== Cartoons and illustrated short stories ===\n\nThe publication also features parody cartoons, most notably \"Doctor Who?\", a humorous look at the series by Tim Quinn and Dicky Howett. This was principally a three-panel [[comic strip]], though occasionally page-long parodies were featured. Also, between 1989 and 1992 \"The Comic Assassins\" was a series of parody strips by Steve Noble and [[Kev F. Sutherland]]. \"Doctor Who?\"'s spiritual successor was the single-panel strip \"Doctor Whoah!\" by 'Baxter'. Embedded into the 'Galaxy Forum' letters page, it lampooned a recent episode, DVD release of stories or other such event by showing alternative, exaggerated and expanded versions of ''Doctor Who'' scenes. For example, after the broadcast of \"[[Partners in Crime (Doctor Who)|Partners in Crime]]\" (2008), the strip portrayed the Doctor's arrival on the 'Planet of the Hats', referred to in the episode. The strip was known for its characters who are depicted as having no pupils in their eyes. Since 2014, \"Doctor Whoah!\" has been replaced by \"The Daft Dimension\", a similarly sized strip in three panels by [[Lew Stringer]].\n\n''DWM'' has also published illustrated short stories in its magazine and parallel publications, most cohesively during the Marvel years. Beginning in ''Doctor Who Weekly'' on 9 April 1980 (issue 26), a sequence of these short stories ran for eight issues, returning is shorts burst for a number of issues every few years up until 1996. Occasional illustrated short stories have appeared since then, including the many parallel publications in both Marvel and Panini years. In addition, there was also a run of 'Brief Encounters', very short one or two page illustrated stories that ran from 28 November 1990 (issue 167) through to 6 July 1994 (issue 214) as well as in contemporary \"Specials\" and \"Yearbooks\" between 1991 and 1992.\n\n=== Regular features and special articles ===\nOther regular features of the magazine include the news section \"Gallifrey Guardian\", which has run since nearly the beginning of the magazine; the letters page \"Galaxy Forum\" which \u2013 as well as containing the \"Daft Dimension\" strip \u2013 features other small sub-sections, such as \"Ask DWM!\" (where readers' questions about the show are answered), \"On This Month\" (which looks at an old issue on the anniversary of its publication) and \"WhoTube\" (which highlights \"Doctor Who\"-themed videos which can be viewed online); reviews of television episodes and merchandise (in \"The DWM Review\", known for a time as \"After Image\", \"Off the Shelf\", and \"Shelf Life\"); the \"Time Team\", which involves four fans watching every ''Doctor Who'' story in order from the beginning; and, since production restarted on the series in 2004, a regular column \"Production Notes\" by the show's executive producer. From 2004 to 2009 the column was written by [[Russell T Davies]], and from January 2010 to July 2017, [[Steven Moffat]] took over the page, although other writers and production staff have from time-to-time written the column. Also, on the final page of magazine, there is a section called \"Wotcha!\" (compiled by 'The Watcher'), a comedy page with such recurring features as, 'A History of Doctor Who in 100 Objects', 'Supporting Artist of the Month', a spoof 'Top Ten', the 'Stockbridge English Dictionary' (a variation on a game from ''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue]]'') and a true or false quiz \"The Six Faces of Delusion\". Prior to this, the slot was taken up by a page called \"Who on Earth is...\", featuring a short interview with someone previously (or currently) involved in Doctor Who (say, a member of the cast).\n\nA single-page 'opinion' column has often been part of the magazine's mix \u2013 past columns have included \"Fluid Links\" by [[Matt Jones (writer)|Matt Jones]], \"The Life and Times of Jackie Jenkins\" by 'Jackie Jenkins', \"It's the End... But\" by 'The Watcher', \"You Are Not Alone\" by [[Jonathan Morris (author)|Jonathan Morris]] (as 'Neil Harris') and \"Relative Dimensions\" by author (and former \"Time Team\" member) [[Jacqueline Rayner]]. The format has changed over the years, but the news, letters, reviews, and comic strip have all been present consistently since the early 1980s.\n\nThe magazine also features interviews with the cast and crew of the television show (including the old episodes), and reports from the set of the current series, written by [[Benjamin Cook (journalist)|Benjamin Cook]] or [[Jason Arnopp]]. The behind-the-scenes stories of all of the 1963\u20131989 episodes have been documented in Andrew Pixley's \"DWM Archive\", and detailed analysis of certain significant serials are covered in \"The Fact of Fiction\", usually written by former ''DWM'' editor [[Alan Barnes (writer)|Alan Barnes]], [[Jonathan Morris (author)|Jonathan Morris]] or David Bailey. \"The DWM Review\" is currently written predominantly by [[Graham Kibble-White]], former editor Gary Gillatt, Paul Kirkley, Martin Ruddock and Matt Michael. Previous reviewers include [[Vanessa Bishop]], [[Craig Hinton]] (died in 2006), and [[Gary Russell]], who subsequently became the magazine's editor.\n\n== ''DWM'' Parallel Publications: Marvel Years (1979\u20131995) ==\n\nDuring the Marvel years (1979\u20131995), ''Doctor Who Magazine'' produced three types of \"Deluxe edition\" series issued in parallel to the main publication. These were the semi-regular '''Specials''' generally issued twice a year seasonally, and most usually labelled \"Summer\" and \"Winter\" (1980\u20131996); '''Yearbooks''', essentially annuals, issued once a year in advance and for Christmas (1992\u20131996); and '''Poster Magazines''', a short run of more visually orientated periodicals with single themes (1994\u20131996). All these series came to an end in the wake of Panini acquiring Marvel, and consequently, ''Doctor Who Magazine'' in 1995.\n\nIn addition, and since its very beginning, ''DWM'' comic strips have been reprinted and - on a few occasions had their original release - in many other publications and formats. Reprinting of ''DWM'' strips began as early as 1980 in parallel serial publications, and over the years there have been a number of such comic reprints and collections, many of which colourised the original strips. In addition, there have also been some original strips issued through these publications. Some series have even reprinted some of the earlier pre-''DWM'' [[Polystyle Publications]] ''Doctor Who'' comic strips that appeared in [[TV Comic]], which began in 1964 and ended when ''DWM'' gained the comic strip licence in 1979. There have also been original ''Doctor Who'' strips in other Marvel publications, and the Doctor appearing in other original Marvel strips (all of which dovetail with the main ''DWM'' strip). Finally, other publishers have reprinted ''DWM'' strips under licence.\n\n=== ''Doctor Who'' Comics USA (1980\u20131986) ===\nThe first series of reprints of ''DWM'' comic strips began in late 1980, only a year or so after the original publication in 1979. These reprints were for the American market, and consisted of four issues in the ''[[Marvel Premiere]]'' series. The ''Marvel Premiere'' series was considered a testing ground to determine if a character or concept could attract enough readers to justify launching their own series. The four issues were considered a success, and so eventually became a series beginning in 1984, titled simply ''Doctor Who''.<ref>{{cite journal|date=October 1984|title = Doctor Who |journal = Marvel USA|issue = 1| page = 3}}</ref> Again, these were reprints were from ''DWM'', and began soon after where ''Marvel Premiere'' left off (skipping a two part strip, perhaps appropriately titled \"Timeslip\" [issues 17-18], a Fourth Doctor story featuring the First, Second, and Third Doctors; this was eventually published in ''Doctor Who'' issue 18). All these strip reprints were colourised for the first time; as were supporting secondary Doctorless strips also taken from ''DWM'' (or, on limited occasions, ''DWM'' Specials). Both ''Marvel Premiere: Doctor Who'' and ''Doctor Who'' had regular features and special articles.\n\n* '''''Marvel Premiere: Doctor Who''''' (Issues 57-60): From December 1980 to June 1981 once every two months, Marvel USA experimented with the ''DWM Doctor Who'' comic strip for an American audience. For four issues they reprinted the earliest two Fourth Doctor main strips. These were now colourised, and with new covers displaying the ''Doctor Who'' logo of the time. These four issues of ''Marvel Premiere: Doctor Who'' were a test run for an American style ''Doctor Who'' comic, which eventually began publishing in 1984. In some editions there were just strips (with the exception of a letters page); in some editions there were also short features. Furthermore, in two editions there were secondary strips, in one instance a ''DWM'' secondary strip, and in the other a non-''Doctor Who'' strip - both of which were in colour.\n\n* '''''Doctor Who''''' (Marvel Comics USA) (Issues 1-23): From October 1984 to August 1986, and following the success of the trial run of ''Marvel Premiere: Doctor Who'', Marvel Comics published a monthly comic book series in America titled simply ''Doctor Who'', that reprinted the Fourth Doctor and some of the earliest Fifth Doctor main strips. Beginning soon after where ''Marvel Premiere: Doctor Who'' had concluded (skipping the third story of the original run, which was eventually published later in the run), once again the strips were colourised and had new covers, but they also appeared in a 'glossy format' rather than traditional American style rough paper print. There were also ''DWM'' secondary strips (again, colourised from the original black and white); or on limited occasions strips taken from early ''DWM'' Specials. The comic had regular features, from issue three a letters column and, from issue 13, \"Who Knows\", described as 'Happenings in the world of ''Doctor Who'''.<ref>{{cite journal|date=December 1984|title = Doctor Who |journal = Marvel USA|issue = 3|page =34}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|date=June 1985|title = Doctor Who |journal = Marvel USA|issue = 13|page =3}}</ref> There were also occasional short special articles on the television show, such as overviews of characters, and interviews with cast and crew members.\n\nThe list below covers all comic strip colourised reprints and notable special articles:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=\"border:none\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"|List of ''Doctor Who'' Comics USA\n|-\n|style=\"padding:0;border:none\"|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|'''USA#''' || '''Title''' ||'''Issue''' ||'''Date''' || '''Pages''' || '''Contents''' || '''References'''\n|-\n\n| 01 || ''Marvel Premiere: Doctor Who'' || 57 || December 1980 || 36 \n|\n''Comic strip (colourised reprints):''\n*\"The Iron Legion\" [1-4 of 8] [DWM issues 1-4] (4D)\n''Articles:''\n*Full page illustration: \"The Five Doctors\" \n*\"Who Is the Doctor\" (2 page written feature on the Doctors) \n*Full page illustrations: \"The Tardis and K-9\";

font-size:10pt;\"| Notes<br />\n{{refbegin}}\n* '''a''' {{Note|Doctor_Who_USA_a}} ''Doctor Who: Marvel Premiere'' ran only one secondary strip from ''DWM'', in the second issue. Unlike the main strip, however, it did not begin by reprinting the secondary strip from the first issue of ''Doctor Who Weekly''. Rather, ''K-9's Finest Hour'' came from issue 12 (2 January 1980). The previous secondary strips (\"The Return of the Daleks\", \"Throwback: The Soul of a Cyberman\", \"The Final Quest\", and \"A Tale of the Time Lords: The Stolen Tardis\") would all run in order from the first issue of ''Doctor Who'' (Marvel USA) to issue 4; with issue 5 printing the story after ''K-9's Finest Hour''.\n* '''b''' {{Note|Doctor_Who_USA_b}} ''Doctor Who'' (Marvel USA) began by reprinting the fourth story from the main comic strip of ''DWM'', ''Doctor Who: Marvel Premiere'' having printed the first two main strips. These publications thus skipped the third story of the run, \"Timeslip\" (issues 17-18; 6\u201313 February 1980). Perhaps this was because while it was a Fourth Doctor strip, it also featured the First, Second, and Third Doctors, and was felt not to be an appropriate way to launch the new publication.\n* '''c''' {{Note|Doctor_Who_USA_c}} The previous issue of ''Doctor Who'' (Marvel USA) had reprinted as its secondary strip the final episode of \"Abslom Daak\u2026 Dalek-Killer\", the secondary strip from ''DWM'' issue 20. This issue of ''Doctor Who'' (Marvel USA) skipped ahead to reprint \"Star Tigers\" [I] as its secondary strip, which began in ''DWM'' issue 27 (as a secondary strip). Thus ''Doctor Who'' (Marvel USA) did not reprint the ''DWM'' secondary strips \"Twilight of the Silurians\", \"Ship of Fools\", and \"The Outsider\". This was no doubt done because \"Star Tigers\" [I] featured the character Abslom Daak and thus had continuity with the previous issue of ''Doctor Who'' (Marvel USA). These three strips were, however, reprinted later in the run, although not in the original order.\n* '''d''' {{Note|Doctor_Who_USA_d}} Once again, as with previous issues of ''Doctor Who'' (Marvel USA), the secondary strip misses out reprinting a number of other secondary strip from ''DWM'' in order to continue the adventures of Abslom Daak in the second and final \"Star Tigers\" story. \"Star Tigers\" [II] begins in issue 44 of ''DWM'' with \"Star Tigers\" [I] concluding in issue 30, thus the secondary strips \"Yonder\u2026 The Yeti\", \"Black Legacy\", and \"Business as Usual\" are skipped (although ''DWM'' carried no secondary strip in issues 39). However, these three skipped ''DWM'' secondary strips appeared in ''Doctor Who'' (Marvel USA) issues 13-15, after the conclusion of \"Star Tigers\" [II].\n* '''e''' {{Note|Doctor_Who_USA_e}} \"Yonder\u2026 The Yeti\" and the next two secondary strips over the next two issues of ''Doctor Who'' (Marvel USA), \"Black Legacy\" and \"Business as Usual\", were the second of two sets of secondary comic strips skipped in order to bring continuity to the \"Abslom Daak\" trilogy (\"Abslom Daak\u2026 Dalek-Killer\",  \"Star Tigers\" [I], and  \"Star Tigers\" [II]) that had appeared non-sequentially in ''DWM'' over the year 1980. After \"Star Tigers\" [II], ''Doctor Who'' (Marvel USA) reprinted the second batch in the order of original publication.\n* '''f''' {{Note|Doctor_Who_USA_f}} \"Ship of Fools\" is a reprint of one the first set of skipped secondary strips that accommodated running the \"Abslom Daak\" trilogy in order, these secondary strips were originally presented non-sequentially in ''DWM'' (\"Abslom Daak\u2026 Dalek-Killer\",  \"Star Tigers\" [I], and  \"Star Tigers\" [II]). \"Twilight of the Silurians\" and \"The Outsider\" - also from the first set of skipped secondary strips - were eventually reprinted, although out of sequence, and mixed in with other ''DWM'' secondary strips. In effect, from this point on ''Doctor Who'' (Marvel USA) freely selects from the remaining ''DWM'' secondary strips abandoning tracking of original order of publication entirely. Regular original ''DWM'' secondary strips finished as of issue 64, and became less frequent over the last few of these issues. Basically, all the secondary strips from ''DWM'' were reprinted colourised from ''DWM'' issue 1-46; and of the remaining 11 strips eight were reprinted before ''Doctor Who'' (Marvel USA) ceased publication.\n* '''g''' {{Note|Doctor_Who_USA_g1}}{{Note|Doctor_Who_USA_g2}} \"Skywatch-7\" was a two part Doctorless comic strip which had its first part published as a secondary strip in ''DWM'' (issue 58) and its second part published in the ''DWM'' Winter Special 1981, both of which were released around the same time in late 1981.\n|}\n|}\n\n''Doctor Who'' (Marvel USA) ceased publication with issue 23 in August 1986. Editor [[Jim Salicrup]] explained the reason as being 'poor sales. Despite a good start, and rather good sales in areas where ''Doctor Who'' (the television programme) is in syndication, sales have been off. Producing ''Doctor Who'' [Marvel USA] in this format has been expensive, and without sufficient sales support it was decided to discontinue [\u2026] rather than sacrifice the quality of the magazine'.<ref>{{cite journal|date=August 1986|title = Doctor Who |journal = Marvel USA|issue = 23|page =2}}</ref> Salicrup is essentially referring to the added costs of the glossy paper and the strips needing to go through a process of colouration.\n\nIn summary, over the entire run of ''Marvel Premiere: Doctor Who'' and ''Doctor Who'' the magazine reprinted in colourised form:\n* the ''DWM'' main comic strip from issue 1 (17 October 1979) through to 77 (June 1983) in consecutive order, with the exception of \"Timeslip\" (''DWM'' issues 17-18) which was initially skipped but included much later in the run essentially as a ''Doctor Who'' (Marvel USA) secondary strip. Thus, the magazine included all the Fourth Doctor strips, and the first four (of a total of six) Fifth Doctor strips.\n* the ''DWM'' Doctorless secondary strip, mostly in order from the beginning of ''Doctor Who'' (Marvel USA) - except for a one part story in ''Marvel Premiere: Doctor Who'' - up until issue 13, when \"Abslom Daak\u2026 Dalek-Killer\" was followed by later strips featuring the character. After that, secondary strips were placed increasingly randomly. Over the entire original run of 27 secondary strips in ''DWM'' (from issue 1 to 64, after which they came to an end as a continuous feature), Marvel USA comics reprinted 24 of these. The exceptions were the one-part stories: \"Star Death\" (''DWM'' #47), \"4-D War\" (''DWM'' #51), and \"Black Sun Rising\" (''DWM'' #57).\n* three Doctorless strips from early ''DWM'' Specials (not including a parody strip from ''DWM'' Winter Special 1983/84 [1983]). One from the ''DWM'' Winter Special 1981 (the second part of story began in ''DWM''); and two from the ''DWM'' Special Summer 1982. The ''Doctor Who Magazine'' Specials are listed in full in the next subsection.\n\n=== ''Doctor Who Magazine Specials'' (1980\u20131996) ===\n\nFrom 1980 to 1996 ''DWM'' released a series of 'Specials' with an increased page count. Early on, the Specials tended to have a mix of articles and comic strips (both reprints and originals). However, after the first few issues and up to about half way through the run, the publication tended to be just composed of articles; with the occasional issue dedicated to comic strip reprints, essentially a 'Graphic Novel' (some in the original black & white, some colourised). The second half of the run went back to including a comic strip in article based issues, during which time there were also two 'Graphic Novels' (both in colour, one reprints, one original). Occasionally, issues carried illustrated short stories. The Specials began by being published twice a year during the summer and winter, and were usually, although not always, branded as such. This changed over the period 1987-1989 when there was only one a year (two for anniversaries), and then none in 1990. The twice year schedule resumed in 1991 again with summer and winter editions, before becoming a little more erratic during and after 1994 to the end of the run. The final two issues were devoted to ''Doctor Who'' movies: *\"[[Dr. Who and the Daleks]]\" and \"[[Daleks \u2013 Invasion Earth: 2150 A.D.]]\" (issue 29) and ''[[Doctor Who (film)|Doctor Who: The Movie]]'' (issue 30).\n\nThese Specials were not numbered, and sometimes contained no indicia or did not specify their status in the indicia - accordingly, confusion has arisen over the years between the Specials and some one-off ''DWM'' comic strip publications from the same period (some named Graphic Novels in their indicia, some with no indicia, or just the title of the publication in the indicia). However, in 2016 ''DWM'' provided a pictorial overview of what they considered official ''DWM'' Specials in their ''Doctor Who Magazine: 500 DWM Issues'' bonus 'Souvenir' publication that came free with ''DWM'' issue 500.<ref name=\"Spilsbury2016-110-111\">\"And Finally... Don't Forget the Specials!\" in Spilsbury (2016), p. 110-111</ref> The list below follows the overview therein, but the issue numbering is imposed for ease of tracking, and was never included in the actual publications. The table below also attempts to capture the flavour of the different types of issue with the labelling 'Seasonal Specials', 'Graphic Novels', 'Anniversary Issues', and 'Movie Specials'. In some cases, however, a single Special can be more than one of these types (such as labelled a seasonal special and an anniversary issue); once again, the numbering is imposed on these issues for ease of tracking the type.\n\n*'''Seasonal Specials''' [SS] (which predominated): most usually twice a year for Winter and Summer, and labelled as such. The covers only rarely indicated the year.\n*'''Graphic Novels''' [GN] (occasional): around half of all the Specials had comic strips, but six were devoted entirely to, or substantially to, comic strips. Note, the numbering here tracks all Marvel era ''Doctor Who'' Graphic Novels across its many different publications (for the full overview see the 'Doctor Who Magazine Graphic Novels (1989\u20131993)' subsection below).\n*'''Anniversary Issues''' [A] (three editions): for the 25th Anniversary of the television series (November 1988); the 10th Anniversary of ''Doctor Who Magazine'' (October 1989); and finally the 30th Anniversary of the television series (November 1993) which was also labelled (unlike the other anniversary editions) a seasonal special for Winter 1993.\n*'''Movie Specials''' [M] (the final two editions): \"The Sixties Dalek Movies\" (also labelled \"Spring Special\") (February 1996); and \"The ''Doctor Who Movie'' Special\" (May 1996) celebrating the return of ''Doctor Who'' to the screen after seven years without any television presence.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=\"border:none\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"|List of ''Doctor Who Magazine

This is due to the high percentage of the page count given over to comic strips. In addition, the 10th Special issue (which comes out in addition to the two seasonal Specials in 1985) reprints these same two strips again (now colourised - see note below) without the articles, and there is no way that cannot be considered a Graphic Novel. \n* '''b''' {{Note|DWM_Specials_b}} \"Skywatch-7\" was a two part Doctorless comic strip which had its first part published as a secondary strip in ''DWM'' (issue 58) and its second part published in the ''DWM'' Winter Special 1981, both of which were released around the same time in late 1981.\n* '''c''' {{Note|DWM_Specials_c}} No indicia in this publication, and no date on cover.

They were first collected and reprinted in the first edition of the Specials: ''Doctor Who Magazine'' Summer Special [1980]. Soon after they were then colourised by Andy Yanchus for ''[[Marvel Premiere]]: Doctor Who'', the Marvel USA try-out publication, used to determine if a character or concept could attract enough readers to justify launching their own series. \"The Iron Legion\" appeared in the first two issues (of the four issue run) in December 1980 (issue 57) and February 1981 (issue 58); \"K9's Finest Hour\" was a secondary strip in December 1980 (issue 57) (see the section 'Doctor Who Marvel Comics USA [1980\u20131986]' above for more information). Accordingly, the reprints here in the '1985 Summer Special Classic' are collected reprints of colourised reprints of an original black and white strip that had also been collected in its original black and white in an earlier edition of the same run of Specials! Things will only get more convoluted here on in... with more black and white reprints and digitally re-coloured versions in other subsequent publications.\n* '''g''' {{Note|DWM_Specials_g}} Indicia does not indicate this is a Special, reading ''Doctor Who Magazine Collected Comics''.

After doing research and interviewing those involved in the original strips, John Ainsworth proposed the sequence titles, which were later used by ''Doctor Who Magazine''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://comiccreatorsuk.wordpress.com/2016/01/12/comic-highlights-the-daleks/|title=Comic Creators Project UK: The Cartoon Museum|accessdate=18 January 2020}}</ref> Various reprints had occurred of some of the episodes over the years, and ''DWM'' began reprinting these strips - in black and white - from issue 33 of ''Doctor Who Weekly'' (28 May 1980). This run eventually went to colour, but never completed. It began again in ''DWM'' in colour with the first episode of ''The Dalek Chronicles'' in issue 180 (27 November 1991) but only ran for a few episodes before transferring to ''Doctor Who Classic Comics'' (1992\u20131994) in its first issue to completion. Accordingly, this ''The Daleks Chronicles'' publication could be seen as much as a ''Doctor Who Classic Comics'' Special (like the previous year's ''Doctor Who Classic Comics: Autumn Special'' printing of ''Evening Empire'' [September 1993]), if it weren't for the indicia (see footnote i). \n* '''m''' {{Note|DWM_Specials_m}} The second and third episodes of \"The Penta Ray Factor\" are printed out of order.

Six years later, Panini kicked off production of 'Specials' once again, this time called 'Special Editions' (2002\u2013present), following very similar formats and mixture of types although issued triannually. Panini would go on to launch another set of triannual 'Specials', known as 'Bookazines', a decade or so after that (2013\u2013present).\n\nWith respect to Specials devoted to comic strips and labelled as 'Graphic Novels' in the list above, there were six issued in total. Along with the three Marvel era 'Graphic Novels' (1989-1993) and the ''DWM Classic Comics Autumn Special: Evening\u2019s Empire'' (1993) publication (which appears as a Special of the 'Classic Comics' run) there were ten Marvel era ''DWM'' 'Graphic Novels' overall. These are all listed together for ease in the '''Doctor Who Magazine'' Graphic Novels (1989\u20131993)' subsection below, with the publications belonging to the different 'Specials' and 'Classic Comics' indicated in the table.\n\n=== ''Doctor Who'' Graphic Novels (1980\u20131994) ===\n\nThere were ten publications during the Marvel era that can be considered 'Graphic Novels'. These were six of the 30 ''Doctor Who Magazine'' 'Specials' (1980\u20131996), ''Evening\u2019s Empire'' (1993) which appeared as a 'Special' of the 'Classic Comics' run (1992-1994), and three one-off publications. The term 'Graphic Novel' must be applied loosely here overall, as all but two these publications collect and reprint several comic stories from ''DWM'', although in most cases the stories are related. Furthermore, the two issues that print original stories in full or part are ''The Age of Chaos'' (1994) in the 'Specials' run; and the aforementioned ''Classic Comics Autumn Special: Evening\u2019s Empire'' (1993), which printed a strip begun but never completed in ''Doctor Who Magazine''. Accordingly, the three one-off 'Graphic Novels' are all reprints from ''DWM'', although two of these colourise original black and white strips:\n\n* '''''Doctor Who: Voyager''''' (1989): Collects and reprints four Sixth Doctor stories from the ''DWM'' main comic strip, including the two stories already reprinted in ''Doctor Who Collected Comics'' (''DWM'' 'Specials') three years previous. These appeared in the order of original publication, and all four strips were colourised for the first time.\n\n* '''''Abslom Daak Dalek Killer''''' (1990): Abslom Daak was a character who first appeared in a ''DWM'' secondary strip in the early years of the publication, when still ''Doctor Who Weekly'' (1980). The character returned a couple of times in two related secondary strips later that year, before appearing in the main strip alongside the Seventh Doctor after almost a decade (1989). This volume collects all these stories, as well as having an original short story linking the early three secondary strips with the later main strip appearance. The strips appear here, as they did in their original publication, in black and white.\n\n* '''''Doctor Who: The Mark of Mandragora''''' (1993): A [[Virgin Publishing]] experiment, who were at the time printing the [[Virgin New Adventures]] ''Doctor Who'' novels (1991-1997) starring the Seventh Doctor. Virgin licenced some Seventh Doctor main comic strips from ''DWM'' and published them in a graphic novel entitled ''Doctor Who: Mark of Mandragora'', reprinting stories that originally appeared between 1990-1991, as well as the text story \"Teenage Kicks\" by [[Paul Cornell]] (1990). The strips were colourised.\n\nThe list below displays all ten 'Graphic Novels', although only the contents of the three stand-alone publications are given here. The seven other publications refer back to the content lists of the sub-sections for ''Doctor Who Magazine'' 'Specials' (1980\u20131996) and ''Doctor Who Classic Comics'' (Marvel) (1992\u20131994). This method has been chosen to both give a full overview of the ten ''DWM'' 'Graphic Novels' in this section, but also so as to differentiate with those that are part of other series. Numbering has been provided to give some order to these publications (and is reflected in the 'Specials' and ''Classic Comics'' sections), but is not official and does not indicate any 'series' designation.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=\"border:none\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"|List of ''Doctor Who'' Graphic Novels\n|-\n|style=\"padding:0;border:none\"|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|'''MGN#''' || '''Series''' || '''Title''' ||'''Date''' || '''Pages''' || '''Contents''' || '''References'''\n|-\n\n| GN-01 || Specials [issue 01] || ''Summer Special'' [1980] || Summer 1980 || 52 \n| \nSee '''Doctor Who Magazine'' Specials (1980\u20131996)' sub-section above.\n| DWMS<ref>{{cite journal|date=1980|title = Summer Special|journal = Doctor Who Magazine|issue = [Special 01]}}</ref>\n|-\n\n| GN-02 || Specials [issue 06] || ''Summer Special'' [1983] || Summer 1983 || 48 \n| \nSee '''Doctor Who Magazine'' Specials (1980\u20131996)' sub-section above.\n| DWMS<ref>{{cite journal|date=1983|title = Summer Special|journal = Doctor Who Magazine|issue = [Special 06]}}</ref>\n|-\n\n| GN-03 || Specials [issue 10] || ''1985 Summer Special Classic'' || Summer 1985 || 52 \n| \nSee '''Doctor Who Magazine'' Specials (1980\u20131996)' sub-section above.\n| DWMS<ref>{{cite journal|date=1985|title = 1985 Summer Special Classic|journal = Doctor Who Magazine|issue = [Special 10]}}</ref>\n|-\n\n| GN-04 || Specials [issue 13] || ''Doctor Who Collected Comics'' || 1986 || 44\n|\nSee '''Doctor Who Magazine'' Specials (1980\u20131996)' sub-section above.\n| DWMS<ref>{{cite journal|date=1986|title = Doctor Who Collected Comics|journal = Doctor Who Magazine|issue = [Special 13]}}</ref>\n|-\n\n| GN-05 || One-off Graphic Novel #1 || ''Doctor Who: Voyager'' {{ref label|DWM_GraphicNovels_a|a|}} || May 1989 || 104 \n| \n''Comics strips (colourised reprints)'':\n*\"The Shape Shifter\" [6D] [issues 88-89; May\u2013June 1984]\n*\"Voyager\" [6D] [issues 90-94; July\u2013November 1984]\n*\"Polly the Glot\" [6D] [issues 95-97; December 1984-February 1985]\n*\"Once Upon a Time Lord\" [6D] [issues 98-99; March\u2013April 1985]\n| DWMGN<ref>{{cite journal|date=1989|title = Doctor Who: Voyager|journal = Doctor Who Magazine|issue = [Graphic Novel 1]}}</ref>\n|-\n\n| GN-06 || One-off Graphic Novel #2 || ''Abslom Daak Dalek Killer'' {{ref label|DWM_GraphicNovels_b|b|}} || April 1990 || 100 \n|\n''Comics strips (reprints in original black and white)'':\n*\"Abslom Daak\u2026 Dalek Killer\" [Doctorless secondary strip] [issues 17-20; 6\u201327 February 1980]\n*\"Star Tigers\" [I&II] [Doctorless secondary strips] [issues 27-30 / 44-46; 16 April-7 May 1980 / September\u2013November 1980]\n*\"Nemesis of the Daleks\" [7D] [issues 152-155; September\u2013December 1989]\n''Short story (original)'':\n*\"Between the Wars: A Slow Night in Paradise\" (fills narrative gap between \"Star Tigers\" and \"Nemesis of the Daleks\")\n| DWMGN<ref>{{cite journal|date=1990|title = Abslom Daak Dalek Killer|journal = Doctor Who Magazine|issue = [Graphic Novel 2]}}</ref>\n|-\n\n| GN-07 || One-off Graphic Novel #3 || ''Doctor Who: The Mark of Mandragora'' {{ref label|DWM_GraphicNovels_c|c|}}|| April 1993 || 94 \n| \n''Comic strips (colourised reprints)'':\n*\"Train-Flight\" [7D] [issues 159-161; April\u2013June 1990]\n*\"Doctor Conkerer!\" [7D] [issue 162; July 1990]\n*\"Fellow Travellers\" [7D] [issues 164-166; 8 September-31 October 1990]\n*\"Darkness, Falling\" (\"The Mark of Mandragora\" prequel I) [Doctorless main strip] [issue 167; 28 November 1990]\n*\"Distractions\" (\"The Mark of Mandragora\" prequel II) [7D] [issue 168; 26 December 1990]\n*\"The Mark of Mandragora\" [7D] [issues 169-172; 23 January-17 April 1991]\n''Short story (reprint)'':\n*\"Teenage Kicks\" [7D] [issue 163; August 1990] (printed between \"Fellow Travellers\" and \"Darkness, Falling\") \n| DWMGN<ref>{{cite journal|date=1993|title = Doctor Who: The Mark of Mandragora|journal = Virgin [licensed from Doctor Who Magazine]|issue = [Graphic Novel 3]}}</ref>\n|-\n\n| GN-08 || Doctor Who Classic Comics [Autumn Special] || ''Evening's Empire'' || September 1993 || 52 \n| \nSee '''Doctor Who'' Classic Comics (Marvel) (1992\u20131994)' sub-section below.\n| DWCCS<ref>{{cite journal|date=September 1993|title = Autumn Special|journal = Doctor Who Classic Comics|issue = [Special]}}</ref>\n|-\n\n| GN-09 || Specials [issue 25] || ''The Dalek Chronicles'' || August 1994 || 108 \n| \nSee '''Doctor Who Magazine'' Specials (1980\u20131996)' sub-section above.\n| DWMS<ref>{{cite journal|date=1994|title = The Dalek Chronicles.

It is worth noting that in a response to a letter to ''Doctor Who Classic Comics'' (issue 4) in 1993, the designation is a 'one-off', as is the title ''Doctor Who Collected Comics'' (GN-04, directly above).<ref>{{cite journal|date=1993|title = Letters|journal = Doctor Who Classic Comics|issue = 4|page = 51}}</ref> Specials status and date for the latter publication is confirmed in ''Doctor Who Magazine: 500 DWM Issues'' bonus 'Souvenir' publication (free with ''DWM'' issue 500) (2016).<ref name=\"Spilsbury2016-110-111\"/> The inference here is that the inclusion of publications like ''Doctor Who Magazine Collected Comics'' in 'Souvenir' is somewhat arbitrary. However, this is the situation, and ''Doctor Who: Voyager'' does not appear in the Specials list. Indeed, as ''Doctor Who'' comic strip historian John Ainsworth notes ''Doctor Who: Voyager'' is considered the first proper 'Graphic Novel' by ''DWM'' and Marvel.<ref>{{cite journal|date=23 June 1993|title =Behind the Frame|journal = Doctor Who Classic Comics|issue = Issue 8|page = 14}}</ref>\n* '''b''' {{Note|DWM_GraphicNovels_b}} ''Abslom Daak Dalek Killer'', although only having it's title on the cover and in the indicia with no format mentioned, is designated a 'Graphic Album' in advertising.

Neither is ''DWM'' mentioned on the credits page, however, the back cover blurb does indeed cite the source material.\n|}\n|}\n\nAfter Marvel sold ''Doctor Who Magazine'' to Panini in 1995, the different formats of Graphic Novels would become much more harmonized with the introduction of the '''Doctor Who'' Comic Strip Collected Editions (2004\u2013present)'. These would reprint ''DWM'' main strips and strips from parallel publications in large A4 editions. The ethos of the 'Collected Editions' was and is to print the stories in their original order and format, in other words, reprinting strips originally produced in black and white as black and white. Accordingly, the Marvel era publications with reprinted but colourised strips generally remains the only way to see these stories in Graphic Novel format. There are exceptions, however. Colourised reprints of the early ''DWM'' black and white strips which had been published in ''Doctor Who'' Marvel Comics USA (1980\u20131986) would appear in ''Doctor Who Classic Comics'' (1992\u20131994), around the same time as the Marvel Graphic Novels. Then, in January 2008 under a Panini licence, [[IDW Publishing]], an American comic book company, would launch ''Doctor Who Classics'', a monthly comic book series reprinting digitally colourised Fourth, Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Doctor strips (2008\u20132014).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=135146 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20070623103614/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=135146 |url-status=dead |archive-date=23 June 2007 |title=IDW Launches Dr. Who Classics in December (press release) |website=[[Newsarama]] |date=3 November 2007}}</ref> The series would go on to be collected in various trade paperbacks, and then some in omnibus editions - both of which can be considered 'Graphic Novels'. However, these are recoloured digitally while the Marvel era were hand-coloured, so the Marvel Graphic Novels retain a certain uniqueness. From later years of ''DWM'' when the strip was colourised (beginning issue 300 in 2001), there were also two Panini era 'Special Editions' (2002\u2013present) that reprinted comic strips for the Ninth Doctor (April 2006) and some of the mid-period Tenth Doctor (April 2008), although these strips went on to also be collected in the 'Collected Editions'.\n\n=== ''DWM'' related ''Doctor Who'' strips (1989-1993) ===\n\nDuring the late 1980s Marvel UK Comics decided to expand its ranges, and created a number of 'experimental' comics.<ref>{{cite book |last2=Gray |first2=Scott|last1=Spilsbury |first1=Tom  |date=2013 |title=\"Hulk Meets Who: Andy Seddon\" in Doctor Who: Nemesis of the Daleks |publisher=Panini |page=185}}</ref> Two of these titles launched toward the end of 1989, both of which were edited by Andy Seddon, featured ''Doctor Who'' content. '''''The Incredible Hulk Presents''''' had an original dedicated stand-alone ''Doctor Who'' comic strip which ran every issue, alongside reprints of other Marvel USA comic strips. The Death's Head situation was far more complex as it was constituted as crossover stories. The already established character of Death's Head featured in a main strip of ''Doctor Who Magazine'', before going on to have its own comic '''''Deaths Head''''' launched where the Doctor went on to appear in one of the stories. Subsequently, Death's Head would return to have another guest appearance in the ''Doctor Who Magazine'' main strip. Both publications suffered poor sales, and were soon cancelled. However, in 1993, all the Death's Head stories, plus those from ''DWM'' featuring Death's Head now specially colourised, were reissued in the pre-planned limited run '''''The Incomplete Death's Head''''' series. The content also included a non-Death's Head ''Doctor Who Magazine'' story (again specially colourised), as well as a newly created coda starring the Doctor in the final pages of the final issue.\n\n==== ''The Incredible Hulk Presents'' (1989) ====\n\n''The Incredible Hulk Presents'' was a short-lived weekly comic from Marvel UK. It launched in September 1989 with issue 1, and lasted twelve issues in total. It reprinted stories from US Marvel Comics' ''The Incredible Hulk'' from the 1970s; ''G.I. Joe: Special Missions'' (retitled for the UK as ''Action Force'', later ''G.I. Joe the Action Force''); and an Indiana Jones strip reprinting Marvel US adaptations of ''Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade'' and further ''Indiana Jones'' adventures. All the reprinted US strips were in colour. The only original content was the ''Doctor Who'' strip, which was, however, produced in black and white.<ref>{{cite book |last2=Gray |first2=Scott|last1=Spilsbury |first1=Tom  |date=2013 |title=\"Hulk Meets Who: A Strange Liaison\" in Doctor Who: Nemesis of the Daleks |publisher=Panini |page=184}}</ref> This strip featured ten adeventures (with two two-parters) of the Seventh Doctor.\n\nThe 'intention (unbeknownst to the editor of ''Doctor Who Magazine'') [was] that the strips would also run in ''DWM''. When he found out, John Freeman took issue with the plan, arguing that while the strips had merit for the intended younger audience ''IHP'' was aimed at, they were inappropriate for ''DWM'', which was trying to tailor more for ''Doctor Who'' fans, instead of the mainstream audience previous editors had aimed for'.<ref>{{cite book |last2=Gray |first2=Scott|last1=Spilsbury |first1=Tom  |date=2013 |title=\"Hulk Meets Who: A Strange Liaison\" in Doctor Who: Nemesis of the Daleks |publisher=Panini |page=184}}</ref> Freeman's argument was eventually accepted by Marvel UK as sales figures of ''DWM'' improved under his leadership; albeit with two exceptions. The two part strip \"Hunger at the Ends of Time!\" from issues 2 and 3 of ''IHP'' was reprinted in ''DWM'' issues 157 and 158 (February - March, 1990); and the one unpublished strip completed for ''IHP'' issue 13 before the publication was cancelled, \"Doctor Conkerer!\", which appeared in ''DWM'' issue 162 (July 1990).<ref>{{cite book |last2=Gray |first2=Scott|last1=Spilsbury |first1=Tom  |date=2013 |title=\"Hulk Meets Who: A Strange Liaison\" in Doctor Who: Nemesis of the Daleks |publisher=Panini |page=184}}</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=\"border:none\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"|List of ''The Incredible Hulk Presents Doctor Who'' strips\n|-\n|style=\"padding:0;border:none\"|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|'''#''' || '''Comic Title''' ||'''Date''' || '''Doctor Who strip''' || '''References'''\n|-\n\n| 01 || ''The Incredible Hulk Presents'' || 7 October 1989 || \"Once In A Lifetime\" || IHP<ref>{{cite journal|date=7 October 1989|title =Banner Headlines|journal = The Incredible Hulk Presents|issue = Issue 1|page=2}}</ref>\n|-\n| 02 || ''The Incredible Hulk Presents'' || 14 October 1989 || \"Hunger at the Ends of Time!\" Part 1 || IHP<ref>{{cite journal|date=14 October 1989|title =Banner Headlines|journal = The Incredible Hulk Presents|issue = Issue 2|page=2}}</ref>\n|-\n| 03 || ''The Incredible Hulk Presents'' || 21 October 1989 || \"Hunger at the Ends of Time!\" Part 2 || IHP<ref>{{cite journal|date=21 October 1989|title =Banner Headlines|journal = The Incredible Hulk Presents|issue = Issue 3|page=2}}</ref>\n|-\n| 04 || ''The Incredible Hulk Presents'' || 28 October 1989 || \"War World\" || IHP<ref>{{cite journal|date=28 October 1989|title =Banner Headlines|journal = The Incredible Hulk Presents|issue = Issue 4|page=2}}</ref>\n|-\n| 05 || ''The Incredible Hulk Presents'' || 4 November 1989 || \"Technical Hitch\" || IHP<ref>{{cite journal|date=4 November 1989|title =Banner Headlines|journal = The Incredible Hulk Presents|issue = Issue 5|page=2}}</ref>\n|-\n| 06 || ''The Incredible Hulk Presents'' || 11 November 1989 || \"A Switch in Time\" || IHP<ref>{{cite journal|date=11 November 1989|title =Banner Headlines|journal = The Incredible Hulk Presents|issue = Issue 6|page=2}}</ref>\n|-\n| 07 || ''The Incredible Hulk Presents'' || 18 November 1989 || \"The Sentinel!\" || IHP<ref>{{cite journal|date=18 November 1989|title =Banner Headlines|journal = The Incredible Hulk Presents|issue = Issue 7|page=2}}</ref>\n|-\n| 08 || ''The Incredible Hulk Presents'' || 25 November 1989 || \"Who's That Girl!\" Part 1 || IHP<ref>{{cite journal|date=25 November 1989|title =Banner Headlines|journal = The Incredible Hulk Presents|issue = Issue 8|page=2}}</ref>\n|-\n| 09 || ''The Incredible Hulk Presents'' || 2 December 1989 || \"Who's That Girl!\" Part 2 || IHP<ref>{{cite journal|date=2 December 1989|title =Banner Headlines|journal = The Incredible Hulk Presents|issue = Issue 9|page=2}}</ref>\n|-\n| 10 || ''The Incredible Hulk Presents'' || 9 December 1989 || \"The Enlightenment of Ly-Chee the Wise\"  || IHP<ref>{{cite journal|date=9 December 1989|title =Banner Headlines|journal = The Incredible Hulk Presents|issue = Issue 10|page=2}}</ref>\n|-\n| 11 || ''The Incredible Hulk Presents'' || 16 December 1989 || \"Slimmer\"  || IHP<ref>{{cite journal|date=16 December 1989|title =Banner Headlines|journal = The Incredible Hulk Presents|issue = Issue 11|page=2}}</ref>\n|-\n| 12 || ''The Incredible Hulk Presents'' || 23 December 1989 || \"Ninevah!\"  || IHP<ref>{{cite journal|date=23 December 1989|title =Banner Headlines|journal = The Incredible Hulk Presents|issue = Issue 12|page=2}}</ref>\n|-\n\n|}\n|}\n\nAndy Seddon, editor of ''IHP'', says that the comic folded quite quickly as 'a result of poor sales. I think everyone involved at the editorial level didn't think it was a coherent offering'.<ref>{{cite book |last2=Gray |first2=Scott|last1=Spilsbury |first1=Tom  |date=2013 |title=\"Hulk Meets Who: Andy Seddon\" in Doctor Who: Nemesis of the Daleks |publisher=Panini |page=186}}</ref> As well as the reprint and re-purposing of the two strips mentioned above, four of the strips were soon reprinted in ''Doctor Who Classic Comics'' (1992\u20131994) - beginning with issue 21 (June 1992) - now specially colourised (see below). Eventually, all the strips (including the re-purposed ''IHP'' issue 13 strip printed in ''DWM'' 162) were reissued in original black and white in the Collected Edition ''Doctor Who: Nemesis of the Daleks'' (2013).\n\n==== ''Death's Head'' & ''Incomplete Death's Head'' (1989-1993) ====\n\nThe character of [[Death's Head]] was a giant robotic bounty hunter created by writer Simon Furman for the Marvel UK's [[The Transformers (Marvel Comics)|''The Transformers'']] comic. According to Furman, Death's Head was simply a 'throwaway character' which would 'be discarded down the line (probably at the end of the first story arc)'.<ref name=\"vol1intro\">Furman, Simon (2006). \"Freelance Peacekeeping Agent Open For Business (or how Death's Head came to be)\", ''Death's Head Volume 1'', Panini Publishing, {{ISBN|1-905239-34-3}}</ref> However, when artist Geoff Senior showed Furman the initial character designs, both agreed Death's Head had potential beyond his planned transitory appearance.<ref name=\"vol1intro\"/> To avoid [[Hasbro]] claiming ownership of the character as a consequence of the ''Transformers'' copyright terms agreed with Marvel, Death's Head had to make his debut in another Marvel comic before appearing in ''Transformers''.<ref name=\"vol1intro\"/> Accordingly, Furman wrote a single-page \"Death's Head\" strip that has become known as \"High Noon Tex\", illustrated by [[Bryan Hitch]]). In this short strip, Death's Head was a noir-ish contract killer of human proportions (thus anticipating the character's size and occupation post-''Transformers'' appearances). The idea was that the strip would be published in a number of Marvel UK titles prior to appearing in ''The Transformers'' - although their is no evidence of any such an early publications. Death's Head made his debut as the giant robotic bounty hunter in the weekly ''The Transformers'' comic beginning with issue 113 (16 May 1987), and appearing during this initial run in 13 issues in total: #114, #117-#119, #133-#134, and #146-#151 (ending 6 February 1988). \n\n'''First Doctor Who crossover: ''Doctor Who Magazine''''' - The character's first association with ''Doctor Who'' happened in the April 1998 edition of ''Doctor Who Magazine'' (issue 135) in the Seventh Doctor main strip '''\"The Crossroads of Time\"'''. In this story the Doctor and Death's Head clashed, the former reducing the latter from a giant robot to human size with 'one of the Master's Tissue Compression Eliminators!,' before sending him to Earth. \n\nDeath's Head then made a guest appearance in Marvel UK's ''Dragon's Claws'' issue 5 (November 1988) in a strip titled \"Watch Out Dragon's Claws - Here's Death's Head\". After these guest appearances, Marvel Comics UK launched the full colour USA size-format ''Death's Head'' in December 1988. The publication was issued monthly, with each edition featuring one long comic strip story starring Death's Head. \n\n'''Second Doctor Who crossover: ''Death's Head''''' - It was during the ''Death's Head'' comic run that the Seventh Doctor appeared as a central antagonist. In issue 8 (July 1989), the story '''\"Time Bomb!\"''' (not to be confused with a ''DWM'' Sixth Doctor story of the same name) saw the Doctor with a bounty on his head. Death's Head picks up the contract from a long term ''Doctor Who Magazine'' character and adversary to the Doctor, uber-capitalist Josiah W. Dogbolter. \n\nDespite the first issue of ''Death's Head'' comic prompting a letter from Stan Lee praising the character and creative team, the publication soon folded. This was reported to be a consequence of distribution problems and the comic being of a smaller size causing it to be obscured by larger comics on the shelf. The ''Death's Head'' publication was cancelled at issue 10 (September 1989). The following year, Death's Head returned in the ''Fantastic Four'' comic (issue 338; March 1990), with a story titled \"Kangs for the Memories!!! Or Guess Who's Coming to Diner\". Later the same year Death's Head featured in an ongoing story called \"The Body in Question\" in Marvel's short lived ''[[Strip (comics)|Strip]]'' comic. Beginning in issue 13 (August 1990) and ending in the final issue of the publication (November 1990) the story was later republished as a Death's Head graphic novel ''Death's Head: The Body in Question'' (1991). This strip not only resolved the cliffhanger at the end of the cancelled ''Death's Head'' series, but also outlined an origin story (although confusingly, perhaps, Death's Head was human sized prior to his confrontation with the Doctor). Death's Head then popped up in ''The Sensational She-Hulk'' (issue 24; February 1991) with the story \"Priceless\", and in a short stand-alone strip in ''Marvel Comics Presents'' (issue 76; March 1991) with \"The Deadliest Game\". \n\n'''Third Doctor Who crossover: ''Doctor Who Magazine''''' - In May 1991, Death's Head featured in a cameo role in the ''Doctor Who Magazine'' main strip in a story called '''\"Party Animals\"''' (issue 173). In the story, the Seventh Doctor attends a party populated by a number of his foes, and witnesses a bar fight explode, in which Death's Head plays a contributing factor.\n\nThis was essentially the end of original stories in Death's Head initial run. However, the character was rebooted as Death's Head II for inclusion in Marvel UK's next wave of titles. Commissioned by the new editor [[Paul Neary]], ''Death's Head II'' replaced the original character with a new version created by [[Dan Abnett]], [[Andy Lanning]], and [[Liam Sharp]]. In an autumn 1992 interview with ''Comic World'', Neary was dismissive about the original character, saying 'I didn't think there was much future in Transformers-style robots and I thought we could do an awful lot better.\" He produced some sample sketches of how he wanted the character to look, and Liam Sharp's demo artwork gave the project 'a kickstart'.<ref>[http://starlogged.blogspot.co.uk/2013/11/1992-deaths-head-ii-interview-in-comic.html scans of Comic World #8 at \"Starlogged: 1992: DEATH'S HEAD II INTERVIEW In COMIC WORLD MAGAZINE\"] (13th November 2013)</ref> ''Death's Head II'' launched with issue 1 in March 1992, and ran for four monthly issues.\n\n'''Fourth Doctor Who crossover: ''The Incomplete Death's Head''''' - Death's Head II was an immediate success, which meant Neary was ordered to create more titles. The simplest way to do this quickly was to reprint the original ''Death's Head'' comic series. The job was given to editor John Freeman. 'Paul was ordered to come up with more Death's Head titles,' said Freeman 'and the easiest way to do that was to reprint the original series. That didn't mean he liked it... I suggested the \"wraparound story\" featuring DHII to help convince him'.<ref>[http://starlogged.blogspot.co.uk/2013/11/1992-deaths-head-ii-interview-in-comic.html?showComment=1396026038197#c7543124516161125598 John Freeman's comment at Starlogged, 28th March 2014]</ref> The series - which ran for twelve issues - was called ''The Incomplete Death's Head'' (January - December 1993). However, it did not only repeat the original series, but also included a number of other Death's Head strips from Marvel publications, pretty much in order of release, the exception being ''The Transformers'' stories and ''The Body in Question'' series. Accordingly, the twelve issues of ''The Incomplete Death's Head'' included everything else from \"High Noon Tex\" through to the ''Marvel Comics Presents'' story \"The Deadliest Game\", as well as beginning (issue 1) and ending (issue 12) with the two ''Doctor Who Magazine'' strips '''\"The Crossroads of Time\"''' and '''\"Party Animals\"''' - now colourised from their original black and white. Strangely, the publication also incorporated a non-Death's Head story early-run (issues 4 and 5), the ''Doctor Who Magazine'' comic strip '''\"Keepsake\"''' (''DWM'' 140; September 1988) once again starring the Seventh Doctor, and once again colourised. This was possible due to way the whole series was framed with the wraparounds, with Death's Head II witnessing these past events in an effort to learn more about his original incarnation. In this way, the Doctor's status of arch-nemesis of the original Death's Head is heightened even before '''\"Time Bomb\"''' appears in issue 9 - the only original ''Death's Head'' series strip featuring the Doctor. Indeed, the final few pages of the final issue - as an '''untitled coda''' - have a fourth encounter with the Doctor, specially produced for the publication.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=\"border:none\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"|List of ''Doctor Who'' and ''Death's Head'' crossovers\n|-\n|style=\"padding:0;border:none\"|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|'''#''' || '''Publication''' ||'''Issue''' ||'''Date''' || '''Story''' || '''Production''' || '''Notes'''\n|-\n\n| 01 || ''Doctor Who Magazine'' ||135 ||Apr 1998 || \"The Crossroads of Time\" || Black and white || Original\n|-\n\n| 02 || ''Death's Head'' ||8||Jul 1989 || \"Time Bomb!\"{{ref label|DH_a1|a|}} || Colour || Original\n|-\n\n| 03 || ''Doctor Who Magazine'' ||173||May 1991 || \"Party Animals\" || Black and white || Original\n|-\n\n| 04 || ''The Incomplete Death's Head'' ||1||Jan 1993 || \"The Crossroads of Time\" || Colour || Reprint - Colourised - of #01\n|-\n\n| 05 || ''The Incomplete Death's Head'' \n|4\n|Apr 1993 \n| \"Keepsake\" (part 1) \n| Colour \n| rowspan=\"2\" |Reprint - Colourised - of ''DWM'' mainstrip issue 140 (Sep 1988){{ref label|DH_b|b|}}\n|-\n\n| 06 \n| ''The Incomplete Death's Head'' \n|5\n|May 1993 \n| \"Keepsake\" (part 2) \n| Colour \n|-\n\n| 07 || ''The Incomplete Death's Head'' ||9||Sep 1993 || \"Time Bomb!\"{{ref label|DH_a2|a|}} || Colour || Reprint of #02\n|-\n\n| 08 || ''The Incomplete Death's Head'' ||12||Dec 1993 || \"Party Animals\" || Colour || Reprint - Colourised - of #03\n|-\n\n| 09 || ''The Incomplete Death's Head'' ||12||Dec 1993 || Untitled coda || Colour || Original\n|-\n\n| colspan=\"7\" style=\"text-align:left; font-size:10pt;\"| Notes<br />\n{{refbegin}}\n* '''a''' {{Note|DH_a1}}{{Note|DH_a2}} \"Time Bomb!\" should not to be confused with a ''Doctor Who Magazine'' Sixth Doctor story of approximately the same name: \"Time Bomb\" (''DWM'' issues 114-116; July - September 1986)\n* '''b''' {{Note|DH_b}} Death's Head does not feature in-strip in \"Keepsake\", but the story is incorporated due to the narrative wraparound used throughout the ''Incomplete Death's Head'' series.\n|}\n|}\n\nIn summary, all of the ''Doctor Who'' and ''Death's Head'' material is included in the ''The Incomplete Death's Head'' series and subsequent graphic novel in colourised form. However, as of 2020, the ''Death's Head'' / ''Incomplete Death's Head'' comic strip of \"Time Bomb!\" and the Untitled coda comic strip of ''Incomplete Death's Head'' has yet to be reprinted in the ''DWM'' Collected Editions series. The original ''DWM'' strips have all been repetrinted - in their original black and white and not their ''Incomplete Death's Head'' colourised form - in ''A Cold Day in Hell'' (2009) (\"The Crossroads of Time\" & \"Keepsake\") and ''The Good Soldier'' (2015) (\"Party Animals\").\n\nThe Death's Head character, post ''Doctor Who'' crossover, would go on to have [[Death's Head|numerous further adventures]] continuing as Death's Head II and then as a third incarnation, Death's Head 3.0, once again created by original Death's Head writer Simon Furman.\n\n=== ''Doctor Who Classic Comics'' (1992\u20131994) ===\n\nBetween 1992 and 1994, Marvel UK published ''Doctor Who Classic Comics''. The aim was, as editor Gary Russell stated in the Editorial of the first issue, 'to reproduce every one of the ''Doctor Who'' strips produced in Britain'.<ref>{{cite journal|date=9 December 1992|title =Editorial|journal = Doctor Who Classic Comics|issue = [Issue 1]|page = 2}}</ref> In the end, the publication only ran for 27 monthly issues, with an additional mid-run 'Autumn Special' in 1993. Over the 27 issues, the publication reprinted strips predominately from the early Polystyle ''Doctor Who'' comic strip and the early ''TV Century 21'' Dalek comic strip, but also from a number of sources including, later in the run, ''DWM'' itself. As well as reprints, the 'Autumn Special' featured the comic strip \"Evening's Empire\", an unfinished story from ''DWM'' issue 180, here completed for the first time. \"Evening's Empire\", accordingly, can be seen as a 'Graphic Novel' and essentially as the only original strip of the publication. The sources were:\n\n*'''''Polystyle''''' comic strip (1964-1979): reprinting selected stories from the First, Second, Third, and Fourth Doctors originally printed in ''TV Comic'' (#674-999 [1964-1971]); ''Countdown'' (#1-39 [1971]); ''Countdown for TV Action'' (#40-56 [1971-1972]); ''TV Action in Countdown'' (#57-58 [1972]); ''TV Action + Countdown'' (#59-100 [1972-1973]); ''TV Action'' (#101-131 [1973]); ''TV Comic + TV Action'' (#1133-1147 [1973]); ''TV Comic'' (#1148-1181 [1973-1974]);  ''TV Comic plus Tom & Jerry Weekly'' (#1182-1201 [1974]); ''TV Comic'' (#1202-1291 [1974-1976]); ''Mighty TV Comic'' (#1292-1352 [1976-1977]); ''TV Comic'' (#1353-1392 [1977-1978]); ''TV Comic with Target'' (#1393-1401 [1978]); and ''TV Comic'' (#1402-1430 [1978-1979]); as well as one strip from an associated annual: ''TV Comic Annual 1976'' (1975). Some of these stories were originally in colour; some in part colour (for example one page was colour, the rest of the pages black and white); or in black and white. For ''DWCC'' all original black and white pages were colourised.\n\n*'''''TV Century 21''''' comic strip (1965-1967): reprinting Dalek stories which had been 'a huge success' in DWCC's 'sister publication, ''Doctor Who Magazine''' and were 'transferred... to give... more space to re-present them'.<ref>{{cite journal|date=9 December 1992|title =Editorial|journal = Doctor Who Classic Comics|issue = [Issue 1]|page = 3}}</ref> The strip was presented in its original colour format, and ran from issue 1 almost every week, completing in issue 19 (April 1994). \n\n*'''''Dell Movie Classics''''' comic strip (December 1966): a one-off American publication (in the ''Dell Movie Classic'' series) featuring a story called ''Dr. Who and the Daleks'' with the [[Peter Cushing|Aaru Doctor (alternative First Doctor played by Peter Cushing)]]. This was an adaptation of the ''[[Dr. Who and the Daleks]]'' film from 1965, in turn adapted from the ''Doctor Who'' television serial \"[[The Daleks]]\" from 1963-4.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-590\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 590</ref> The reprint appeared in its entirety in ''DWCC'' issue 9. Printed in original colour.\n\n*'''''Doctor Who Magazine''''' comic strip (1979-1991): ''DWCC'' reprinted mostly main strips from the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Doctors; as well as completing the Seventh Doctor story \"Evening's Empire\" in the mid-run 'Autumn Special' (September 1993). The ''DWM'' main strip reprints began in ''DWCC'' issue 9 (July 1993) with a Fourth Doctor story. ''DWCC'' also reprinted some ''DWM'' secondary strips (essentially Doctorless), beginning in issue 23. All were originally in black and white (barring two pages of the Fifth Doctor story 'The Tides of Time' - ''DWM'' issue 66), and were specially colourised for ''DWCC'' (even when some had previously been colourised for reprints in ''Doctor Who'' Comics USA [1980\u20131986]).\n\n*'''''The Incredible Hulk Presents''''' comic strip (1989): a short run of a parallel Seventh Doctor strip in the short-lived ''The Incredible Hulk Presents'' comic. It launched in September 1989 with issue 1, and lasted twelve issues in total. It reprinted stories from US Marvel Comics' ''The Incredible Hulk'' from the 1970s; ''G.I. Joe: Special Missions'' (retitled for the UK as ''Action Force'', later ''G.I. Joe the Action Force''); and an ''Indiana Jones'' strip reprinting Marvel US adaptations of ''Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade'' and further Indiana Jones adventures. All these US strips were in colour. The ''Doctor Who'' strip, however, was in black and white. One story was later printed in ''DWM'', Hunger from the Ends of Time!; and one unpublished strip, ''Doctor Conkerer!'', was produced for the unprinted issue #13 later being printed in ''DWM'' 162. ''DWCC'' reprinted only four of the early stories, over three issues beginning in issue 21. All four one-part strips were colourised.\n\nThe comic strips in ''Doctor Who Classic Comics'' were presented in full colour, meaning strips were colourised when not originally released in colour.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=\"border:none\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"|List of ''Doctor Who'' Classic Comics\n|-\n|style=\"padding:0;border:none\"|\n{|

It began again in ''DWM'' in colour with the first episode of ''The Dalek Chronicles'' in issue 180 (27 November 1991) but only ran for a few episodes before transferring to ''Doctor Who Classic Comics'' (1992\u20131994) in this first issue. \n* '''d''' {{Note|DWCC_d}} \"The Klepton Parasites\", was not only the first ever First Doctor strip, but also the first ever ''Doctor Who'' comic strip story.\n* '''e''' {{Note|DWCC_e}} The second and third episodes of \"The Penta Ray Factor\" are printed out of order.

'With the finest of the ''Doctor Who'' strips's pre-Marvel heritage reprinted, our work is largely done. Other projects beckon for us'.<ref>{{cite journal|date=7 December 1994|title =Contents|journal = Doctor Who Classic Comics|issue = Issue 27|page = 3}}</ref> With this final issue, ''DWCC'' completed the full run of the ''Countdown'' / ''TV Action'' run (excluding specials and annuals) during the mid-period of the Polystyle Third Doctor strips, before the strips left and then returned to ''TV Comic''. However, of the two ''TV Comic'' periods (First, Second, half of the Third, and Fourth Doctors), only 32 of the potential 152 strips were ever reprinted (just over 20%). The situation was even worse with respect to the fifteen or so years of ''Doctor Who Magazine'' strips and (admitted far, far shorter run) of the ''The Incredible Hulk Presents'' strips. That the publication was terminated for reasons other than having completed the Third Doctor ''Countdown'' / ''TV Action'' strips is the fact that the ongoing \"Vworp Vworp\" articles, which were printing a chronology of ''Doctor Who'' comic strips with short synopses, only reached then end of the Third Doctor Polystyle period.\n\n=== ''Doctor Who Yearbooks'' (1992\u20131996) ===\n\nBetween 1992 and 1996 Marvel UK published a number of ''Doctor Who Yearbooks'' \u2013 essentially annuals \u2013 containing articles, comic strips, and short fiction. These continued the tradition of ''Doctor Who Annuals'' that had been issued under a separate licence from the BBC by [[World Distributors (Manchester) Ltd|World Distributors]] between 1965 and 1985 (for the years 1966 to 1986); renaming themselves World International, Ltd. in 1981, but due to falling sales limiting their publishing activities before ceasing trading later that decade.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://comicvine.gamespot.com/world-distributors/4010-3225/|title=Comic Vine: World Distributors (Manchester) Ltd|accessdate=25 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=\"border:none\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"|List of ''Doctor Who Yearbooks''\n|-\n|style=\"padding:0;border:none\"|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|'''Yb#''' || '''Title''' ||'''Date''' || '''Pages''' || '''Fiction''' || '''Articles''' \n|-\n\n| 01 \n| '''''Doctor Who Yearbook''''' [1992] \n| October 1991 \n| 64 \n| \nComic strips:\n* \"Under Pressure\" (7D, 4D & 3D) \n''Brief Encounter'' short stories:\n* \"The Meeting\" (1D) <small>[Reprint from ''DWM'' #167]</small>\n* \"Future Imperfect\" (2D & 3D)\n* \"Time on a Vine\" (5D)\n* \"The Deal\" (6D) \n| \n*\"Where it All Began\" \n*\"The Doctor Ordered\" \n*\"The Complete Guide\" \n*\"Behind the Scenes\" (TV: \"The Curse of Fenric\")\n*\"First Call\" (TV: \"The Curse of Fenric\")\n|-\n\n| 02 \n| '''''Doctor Who Yearbook 1993''''' \n| September 1992 \n| 64 \n| \nComic strips:\n* \"Metamorphosis\" (7D)\n''Brief Encounter'' short stories:\n* \"Cambridge Previsited\" (1D)\n* \"Dream a Little Dream for Me\" (2D &7D)\n* \"Country of the Blind\" (3D)\n* \"Farewells\" (4D)\n* \"Encounter on Burnt Snake Flat\" (5D)\n* \"A Tourist Invasion\" (6D) \n| \n* \"Spearheads From Space\" (invaders)\n* \"Daggers of the Mind\" (manipulators)\n* \"Making (New) Myths\" \n* \"The Sonic Screwdriver\"y \n* \"Collectors Corner: The Silly Season\" (novelty merchandise) \n* \"Terrible Tunes\" (music merchandise)\n* \"Dressing Up\" (clothing merchandise)\n* \"Monster files\"\n* \"A4 Schematics\" \n|-\n\n| 03 \n| '''''Doctor Who Yearbook 1994''''' \n| September 1993 \n| 64 \n| \nComic strips:\n*\"A Religious Experience\" (1D & 7D)\n*\"Rest and Re-Creation\" (4D)\nShort stories:\n*\"Loop the Loup\" (2D)\n*\"Reconnaissance\" (3D)\n*\"The Changeling Years\" (4D)\n*\"Perfect Day\" (5D)\n*\"The More Things Change\" (6D)\n*\"Pulling Strings\" (7D) \n| \n*\"The Unknown Forest\" (high-brow perception)\n*\"Andrew Pixley's WhoFax\" (trivia) \n*\"Thirty Years of Doctor Who in Fiction\" \n*\"Thirty Years of Doctor Who in Fact\"\n|-\n\n| 04 \n| '''''Doctor Who Yearbook 1995''''' \n| September 1994 \n| 64 \n| \nComic strips:\n*\"The Naked Flame\" (4D)\n*\"Blood Invocation\" (5D)\nShort stories:\n*\"Urrozdinee\" (1D)\n*\"Briefly Noted\" (2D)\n*\"The Hungry Bomb\" (3D)\n*\"Rescue\" (Doctorless)\n*\"The Beast Inside\" (4D)\n*\"One Last Try\" (5D)\n*\"Work is Hell\" (6D)\n*\"Blood Invocation\" (5D)\n*\"It's Only a Game\" (7D) \n| \n*\"Retrospective: 30 Years in the TARDIS\"\n*\"Retrospective: ''The Paradise of Death''\" (audio)\n*\"Retrospective: ''Dimensions in Time''\" (TV) \n|-\n\n| 05 \n| '''''Doctor Who Yearbook 1996''''' \n| September 1995 \n| 96 \n| \nComic strips:\n*\"Star Beast II\" (4D)\n*\"Junkyard Demon II\" (4D) \n| \n*\"A Brief History of Space and Time\" (season guide) \n*\"The Nineties\"\n*\"Valley of the Lost\" (summary of unmade TV story)\n|-\n\n|}\n|}\n\n=== ''Doctor Who Poster Magazine'' (1994\u20131996) ===\n\nBetween 1994 and 1996 Marvel UK published a number of ''Doctor Who Poster Magazines'', produced in full colour with visual image based articles, each with a specific theme.

These are stand alone magazines themed around a specific topic and carrying a much higher page count than the regular magazine. Over the run, so far, there have been eight themes:\n\n*'''Doctor Who eras''' (2002\u20132014): These issues explored the stories in a Doctor's era, sometimes over a number of 'volumes'. This theme was named '''The Complete x Doctor''' for the classic series, and '''The Doctor Who Companion''' for the post-2005 series \u2013 although the last two of these have different names, the ''Official Guide'' covering the final part of the Eleventh Doctor's final season (April 2014), and ''The Year of the Doctor'' 50th Anniversary edition (August 2014). This strand of the \"Special Editions\" came to an end with these two releases, but is continued in the rebooted \"Bookazine\" series as of 2019 with the Twelfth Doctor.\n\n*'''Anniversaries''' (2003\u2013): Beginning with ''We Love Doctor Who'' (November 2003), celebrating the 40th anniversary of the first broadcast of the TV show, the Special Editions have marked all the major milestones of the programme. In the case of the 50th Anniversary edition (August 2014), this publication also had the function of being the final part of the ''Doctor Who eras'' thematic, which post-2005 was labelled '''The Doctor Who Companion''' (in all but this and the penultimate instalment, tagged an ''Official Guide'').\n\n*'''In Their Own Words''' (2005\u20132010): An overview of the programme's history produced chronologically. This series collected excerpts from interviews with ''Doctor Who'' cast and crew over the years 1963 to 2009. The series concluded in 2010.\n\n*'''Comic strip reprints''' (2006\u20132008): The Special Editions became the reprint format for the main comic strip for the Ninth Doctor (April 2006) and some of the mid-period Tenth Doctor (April 2008). These strips were, however, also collected in the Collected Edition format (2004\u2013present) in ''The Cruel Sea'' (2014) for the Ninth Doctor; and ''The Widow's Curse'' (2009, Collected Tenth Doctor Comic Strips Volume 2).\n\n*'''Missing Episodes''' (2013): The three 2013 Special Editions published Telesnaps from missing episodes from the Hartnell and Troughton eras.\n\n*'''Sarah Jane Adventures''' (2009\u20132012): Three special editions between 2009 and 2012 covering the production of the \"Doctor Who\" television spin-off \"The Sarah Jane Adventures\".\n\n*'''Yearbooks''' (2015\u2013): Beginning with the 2015 Yearbook (December 2014), these publications are issued once a year looking back over the previous year in ''Doctor Who''.\n\n*'''Topics''' (2015\u2013): In the wake of the first \"Doctor Who Yearbook\" (2015; published December 2014), the \"Special Editions\" devoted the other two releases of 2015 to specific topics: ''The Art of Doctor Who'' (April 2015) and ''The Music of Doctor Who'' (August 2015). This pattern of a Yearbook followed by two topics has continued to present.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=\"border:none\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"|List of Special Editions\n|-\n|style=\"padding:0;border:none\"|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|'''SE#''' || '''Series#''' || '''Title''' ||'''Date''' || '''Pages''' || '''Contents''' || '''References'''\n|-\n\n| 01 || C-01 || The Complete Fifth Doctor || March 2002 || 68 || A detailed look at the complete run of [[Fifth Doctor]] stories and their various spin offs.

These Collected Editions have not always been published in the order of original publication in ''Doctor Who Weekly/Magazine'' and its ''Yearbooks'', ''Specials'' and associated publications. Panini have published two or three of these Collected Editions each year from 2004 to 2019, except 2010 and 2011 when the Collected Editions were put on hold for reasons unknown.\n\nAs of December 2019 there have been 29 volumes released, the most recent being ''Ground Zero'', which features strips from the First, Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Seventh Doctors. As Panini have now collected all the main strips up to the end of the Twelfth Doctor continuity, they began focusing upon the 'past Doctors' period of the magazine (1994\u20131996, between the end of the Seventh Doctor continuity and beginning of the Eighth Doctor continuity) and other strips from across its publications throughout the years while they built up enough Thirteenth Doctor strips for a Collected Edition. The first Thirteenth Doctor Collected Edition (volume 30) is due in 2020.\n\nThe list of volumes below is placed in the original order of their publication in ''Doctor Who Magazine'', which parallels the continuity of the television series, except for the 'past Doctors' period (1994\u20131996) when the publication began seeding one-off stories from all the past Doctors from the period prior to and including the Seventh. The Collected Editions with these stories are thus placed between the Seventh and Eighth Doctor continuities, except for irregularities, the most substantial being volume 28 ''The Clockwise War'', which leads with the final strip of the Twelfth Doctor period, but also includes past Doctor stories from the ''Doctor Who Yearbooks'' published between 1994 and 1996. Many of the Collected Edition also feature bonus material, such as specially commissioned commentaries by the authors and artists, and sometimes short stories (the latter taken from ''Doctor Who Magazine'') \u2013 these are signalled in the 'Notes' of the below table.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=\"border:none\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"|List of Collected Editions\n|-\n|style=\"padding:0;border:none\"|\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n| '''Title''' || '''Doctor''' || '''Comic Strips''' || '''Authors''' || '''Pages''' || '''#''' || '''Published''' || '''ISBN'''\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" | '''The Iron Legion''' {{ref label|Collected_Editions_a|a|}}\n| rowspan=\"5\" | [[Fourth Doctor#Comics|Fourth]] \n| \"The Iron Legion\" (issues 1\u20138)\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Story [[Pat Mills]];
