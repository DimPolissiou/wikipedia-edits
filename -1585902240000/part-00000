As early as the late 19th century, Asian immigrants were subject to racial prejudice in the United States. Laws were passed that openly discriminated against Asians, and sometimes Japanese in particular. Many of these laws stated that Asians could not become citizens of the United States and could not hold basic rights, such as owning land. These laws were greatly detrimental to the newly arrived immigrants, since many of them were farmers and had little choice but to become migrant workers. Some cite the formation of the [[Asiatic Exclusion League]] as the start of the anti-Japanese movement in California.<ref>{{Cite book\n|author=Brian Niiya\n|title=Japanese American history: an A-to-Z reference from 1868 to the present\n|edition=illustrated\n|publisher=Verlag f\u00fcr die Deutsche Wirtschaft AG\n|year=1993\n|isbn=978-0-8160-2680-7\n|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=QZg6Ft_jvJ0C&pg=PA37#PRA1\u2013PA37,M1 37], [https://books.google.com/books?id=QZg6Ft_jvJ0C&pg=RA1\u2013PA103 103\u2013104]\n|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QZg6Ft_jvJ0C\n|ref=harv\n|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>\n\n====Early 20th century====\n[[File:San Francisco Chinatown Welcome.jpg|thumb|Young China Club warning to American visitors against buying Japanese goods in San Francisco's Chinatown c. 1940]]\n\nAnti-Japanese racism and [[Yellow Peril]] in California had intensified after the Japanese victory over the [[Russian Empire]] in the [[Russo-Japanese War]]. On 11 October 1906, the San Francisco, California Board of Education had passed a regulation whereby children of Japanese descent would be required to attend racially segregated separate schools. At the time, Japanese immigrants made up approximately 1% of the population of California; many of them had come under the treaty in 1894 which had assured free immigration from Japan.\n\nThe invasion of China in 1931 and the conquest of [[Manchuria]] was roundly criticized in the US. In addition, efforts by citizens outraged at Japanese atrocities, such as the [[Nanking Massacre]], led to calls for American economic intervention to encourage Japan to leave China; these calls played a role in shaping American foreign policy. As more and more unfavorable reports of Japanese actions came to the attention of the American government, embargoes on oil and other supplies were placed on Japan, out of concern for the Chinese populace and for American interests in the Pacific. Furthermore, the European American population became very pro-China and anti-Japan, an example being a grass-roots campaign for women to stop buying silk stockings, because the material was procured from Japan through its colonies.\n\nWhen the [[Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945)|Second Sino-Japanese War]] broke out in 1937, Western public opinion was decidedly pro-China, with eyewitness reports by Western journalists on atrocities committed against Chinese civilians further strengthening anti-Japanese sentiments. African American sentiments could be quite different than the mainstream, with organizations like the [[Pacific Movement of the Eastern World]] (PMEW) which promised equality and land distribution under Japanese rule. The PMEW had thousands of members hopefully preparing for liberation from white supremacy with the arrival of the [[Japanese Imperial Army]].\n\n====During World War II====\n[[File:Alaska Death Trap.jpg|left|upright|thumb|An American propaganda poster - \"Death-trap for the Jap.\"]]\n[[File:JapaneseAmericanGrocer1942.jpg|left|upright|thumb|A Japanese American unfurled this banner the day after the Pearl Harbor attack.

The Japanese attack propelled the United States into World War II. The Americans were unified by the attack to fight against the [[Empire of Japan]] and its allies, the [[Nazi Germany|German Reich]] and the [[Kingdom of Italy]].\n\nThe surprise attack at [[Naval Station Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] prior to a [[declaration of war]] was commonly regarded as an act of treachery and cowardice. Following the attack many non-governmental \"[[Jap hunts|Jap hunting]] licenses\" were circulated around the country. ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine published an article on how to tell a Japanese from a Chinese person by the shape of the nose and the stature of the body.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n| editor-last =Luce\n| editor-first=Henry\n| editor-link =Henry Robinson Luce\n| date        = 22 December 1941\n| title       = How to tell Japs from the Chinese\n| journal     = Life\n| volume      = 11\n| issue       = 25\n| pages       = 81\u201382\n| publisher   = Time Inc.\n| location    = Chicago\n| url         = https://books.google.com/?id=Y04EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA11&dq=life%20magazine%20back%20issues%20Dec%2022%201941&pg=PA81#v=onepage&q=\n| accessdate  = 19 February 2010\n| ref =harv\n}}</ref> Japanese conduct during the war did little to quell anti-Japanese sentiment. Fanning the flames of outrage were the treatment of American and other [[POW|prisoners of war]] (POWs). Military-related outrages included the murder of POWs, the use of POWs as slave labor for Japanese industries, the [[Bataan Death March]], the [[kamikaze]] attacks on Allied ships, and atrocities committed on [[Wake Island]] and elsewhere.\n\nU.S. historian James J. Weingartner attributes the very low number of Japanese in U.S. POW compounds to two key factors: a Japanese reluctance to surrender and a widespread American \"conviction that the Japanese were 'animals' or 'subhuman' and unworthy of the normal treatment accorded to POWs.\"<ref name=Weingartner1992p55>{{harvnb|Weingartner|1992|p=55}}</ref> The latter reasoning is supported by [[Niall Ferguson]], who says that \"Allied troops often saw the Japanese in the same way that Germans regarded Russians [sic] &mdash; as [[Untermensch]]en.\"<ref>Niall Fergusson, \"Prisoner Taking and Prisoner Killing in the Age of Total War: Towards a Political Economy of Military Defeat\", ''War in History'', 2004, 11 (2): p.182</ref> Weingartner believes this explains the fact that a mere 604 Japanese captives were alive in Allied POW camps by October 1944.<ref name=Weingartner1992p54 />\nUlrich Straus, a U.S. [[Japanology|Japanologist]], believes that front line troops intensely hated Japanese military personnel and were \"not easily persuaded\" to take or protect prisoners, as they believed that Allied personnel who surrendered, got \"no mercy\" from the Japanese.<ref name=Ulrich-Straus-116>[https://books.google.com/books?id=x1dQwuiEU3UC&pg=PA206&lpg=PA206&dq=%22japanese+pows%22+american+hands&source=web&ots=Jy7xIG7C1S&sig=J2I027gBjV9cqjD7t3h1-FiQW3o#PPA116,M1 Ulrich Straus, ''The Anguish Of Surrender: Japanese POWs of World War II'' (excerpts)] Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2003 {{ISBN|978-0-295-98336-3}}, p.116</ref> Allied soldiers believed that Japanese soldiers were inclined to feign surrender, in order to make surprise attacks.<ref name=Ulrich-Straus-116/> Therefore, according to Straus, \"[s]enior officers opposed the taking of prisoners[,] on the grounds that it needlessly exposed American troops to risks&nbsp;...\"<ref name=Ulrich-Straus-116/>\n\n[[File:Salvage Scrap propaganda poster crop2.jpg|thumb|upright|An American propaganda poster from World War II produced under the [[Works Progress Administration]].]]\n\nAn estimated 112,000 to 120,000 Japanese migrants and [[Japanese American]]s from the West Coast were [[Japanese American internment|interned]] regardless of their attitude to the US or Japan.

Nowhere was this more visible than in the automobile industry, where the lethargic [[Big Three (automobile manufacturers)|Big Three]] ([[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]], [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], and [[Chrysler Corporation|Chrysler]]) watched as their former customers bought Japanese imports from [[Honda]], [[Subaru]], [[Mazda]], and [[Nissan]], a consequence of the [[1973 oil crisis|1973]] and [[1979 energy crisis]]. (When Japanese automakers were establishing their inroads into the USA and Canada. Isuzu, Mazda, and Mitsubishi had joint partnerships with a Big Three manufacturer (GM, Ford, and Chrysler) where its products were sold as [[captive import|captives]]). The anti-Japanese sentiment manifested itself in occasional public destruction of Japanese cars, and in the 1982 [[murder of Vincent Chin]], a [[Chinese American]] beaten to death when he was mistaken to be Japanese.\n\nOther highly symbolic deals \u2014 including the sale of famous American commercial and cultural symbols such as [[Columbia Records]], [[Columbia Pictures]], [[7-Eleven]], and the [[Rockefeller Center]] building to Japanese firms \u2014 further fanned anti-Japanese sentiment.\n\nPopular culture of the period reflected American's growing distrust of Japan.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Futuristic period pieces such as ''[[Back to the Future Part II]]'' and ''[[RoboCop 3]]'' frequently showed Americans as working precariously under Japanese superiors. The film ''[[Blade Runner]]'' showed a futuristic Los Angeles clearly under Japanese domination (with a Japanese majority population and culture), perhaps a reference to the alternate world presented in ''[[The Man in the High Castle]]'' written by [[Philip K. Dick]], the same author on which the film was based, in which Japan had won World War II. Criticism was also lobbied in many novels of the day. Author [[Michael Crichton]] wrote ''[[Rising Sun (novel)|Rising Sun]]'', a [[murder mystery]] (later made into a [[Rising Sun (film)|feature film]]) involving Japanese businessmen in the U.S. Likewise, in [[Tom Clancy]]'s book, ''[[Debt of Honor]]'', Clancy implies that Japan's prosperity is due primarily to unequal trading terms, and portrays Japan's business leaders acting in a power hungry cabal.\n\nAs argued by Marie Thorsten, however, Japanophobia mixed with Japanophilia during Japan's peak moments of economic dominance during the 1980s. The fear of Japan became a rallying point for techno-nationalism, the imperative to be first in the world in mathematics, science and other quantifiable measures of national strength necessary to boost technological and economic supremacy. Notorious \"Japan-bashing\" took place alongside the image of Japan as superhuman, mimicking in some ways the image of the [[Soviet Union]] after it launched the first [[Sputnik]] satellite in 1957: both events turned the spotlight on American education. American bureaucrats purposely pushed this analogy. In 1982, Ernest Boyer, a former U.S. Commissioner of Education, publicly declared that, \"What we need is another Sputnik\" to re-boot American education, and that \"maybe what we should do is get the Japanese to put a Toyota into orbit.\"<ref name=Thorsten2012p150>{{Harvnb|Thorsten|2012|p=150n1}}</ref> Japan was both a threat and a model for human resource development in education and the workforce, merging with the image of Asian-Americans as the \"model minority.\"\n\nBoth the animosity and super-humanizing which peaked in the 1980s, when the term \"Japan bashing\" became popular, had largely faded by the late 1990s. Japan's waning economic fortunes in the 1990s, known today as [[Lost Decade (Japan)|the Lost Decade]], coupled with an upsurge in the U.S. economy as the Internet took off largely crowded anti-Japanese sentiment out of the popular media.\n\n===China===\n{{Main|Anti-Japanese sentiment in China}}\n[[File:Japanese-and-dogs-are-not-allowed statement from a restaurant in Higher Education Mega Center 2007.jpg|upright|thumb|Poster outside of a restaurant in [[Guangzhou]], China]]\nAnti-Japanese sentiment is felt very strongly in China and distrust, hostility and negative feelings towards Japan, Japanese people and culture is widespread in China. Anti-Japanese sentiment is a phenomenon that mostly dates back to modern times (post-1868). Like many Western powers during the era of imperialism, Japan negotiated treaties that often resulted in the annexation of land from China towards the end of the Qing Dynasty. Dissatisfaction with Japanese settlements and the [[Twenty-One Demands]] by the Japanese government led to a serious [[boycott of Japanese products]] in China.\n\nToday, bitterness in China persists<ref>\"[https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-25411700 China and Japan: Seven decades of bitterness]\". BBC News, 13 February 2014, accessed 14 April 2014</ref> over the atrocities of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] and Japan's post-war actions, particularly the perceived lack of a straightforward acknowledgment of such atrocities, Japanese government employment of known past war criminals, and Japanese historic revisionism in textbooks. From elementary school, children are taught about Japanese war crimes in detail, for example, thousands of children are brought to the [[Museum of the War of Chinese People's Resistance Against Japanese Aggression]] in Beijing by their elementary schools to view photos of war atrocities, such as exhibits of records of Japanese military forcing Chinese workers into wartime labour,<ref>\"[http://www.1937china.org.cn/wmskz/shaiww/wwshiliao/20140407/20516.shtml]\"</ref> the [[Nanking Massacre]],<ref>\"[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/photo/2014-02/27/c_133147912.htm People visit Museum of War of Chinese People's Resistance Against Japanese Aggression in Beijing]\". Xinhuanet, 27 February 2014, accessed 14 April 2014</ref> and the issues of [[comfort women]]. After viewing the museum, the children's hatred of the Japanese people was reported to increase significantly. Despite the time that has passed since the end of the Second World War, discussions about the Japanese conduct can still evoke powerful emotions today, in part because most Japanese are aware of what happened but their society has never engaged in the type of introspection common in Germany after the Holocaust.<ref>Matthew Forney, \"[http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1139759,00.html Why China Loves to Hate Japan]\".

Nearly every Filipino family was hurt by the war on some level. Most notably in the city of [[Candaba, Pampanga|Mapanique]], survivors recount the Japanese occupation with Filipino men being massacred and dozens of women being herded to be used as comfort women. Today, the Philippines is considered to have un-antagonistic relations with Japan. In addition, Filipinos are generally not as offended as Chinese or Koreans are about the claim from some quarters that these atrocities are given little, if any, attention in Japanese classrooms. It is the result of the huge Japanese aid sent to the country during the 1960s and the 1970s.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/12/world/asia/12iht-phils.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first=Carlos H. | last=Conde | title=Letter from the Philippines: Long afterward, war still wears onFilipinos | date=13 August 2005}}</ref>\n\n[[Davao Region|Davao]] in [[Mindanao]] had a large population of Japanese immigrants who acted as a fifth column, welcoming the Japanese invaders during World War II.

Nevertheless, a significant numbers of Japanese immigrants did arrive in Australia prior to 1900 (perhaps most significantly in the town of [[Broome, Western Australia|Broome]]). By the late 1930s, Australians feared that Japanese military strength might lead to expansion in Southeast Asia and the Pacific, perhaps even [[Proposed Japanese invasion of Australia during World War II|an invasion of Australia itself]]. This resulted in a ban on [[iron ore]] exports to the Empire of Japan, from 1938. During World War II atrocities were frequently committed to Australians who surrendered (or attempted to surrender) to Japanese soldiers, most famously the ritual beheading of [[Leonard Siffleet]], which was photographed, as well as incidents of cannibalism and the shooting down of ejected pilots' parachutes. Anti-Japanese feelings were particularly provoked by the sinking of the unarmed [[AHS Centaur|Hospital Ship ''Centaur'']] (painted white and with [[Red Cross]] markings), with 268 dead. Treatment of Australians prisoners of war was also a factor, with over 2,800 Australian POWs dying on the [[Burma Railway]] alone.\n\n===Russian Empire and Soviet Union===\nIn the [[Russian Empire]], the Japanese victory in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] in 1905 halted Imperial Russia's ambitions in the East, leaving them humiliated. Later, during the [[Russian Civil War]], Japan was part of the [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|Allied interventionist forces]] that helped to occupy [[Vladivostok]] until October 1922 with a puppet White government under [[Grigory Semenov|Grigorii Semenov]]. At the end of World War II, the [[Red Army]] accepted the surrender of nearly 600,000 [[Japanese POWs in the Soviet Union|Japanese POWs]] after Emperor Hirohito announced the surrender of Japan on 15 August. Of these, 473,000 were repatriated, with 55,000 having died in Soviet captivity and the fate of the rest being unknown.

It is the resting place of thousands of not only Japanese soldiers, but also Korean and Taiwanese soldiers killed in various wars, mostly in World War II. The shrine includes 13 [[crime against peace|Class A criminals]] such as [[Hideki Tojo]] and [[K\u014dki Hirota]], who were convicted and [[execution|executed]] for their roles in the Japanese invasions of China, Korea, and other parts of East Asia after the remission to them under [[Treaty of San Francisco]]. A total of 1,068 convicted war criminals are enshrined at the Yasukuni Shrine.\n\nIn recent years, the Yasukuni Shrine has become a sticking point in the relations of Japan and its neighbours. The enshrinement of war criminals has greatly angered the people of various countries invaded by Imperial Japan. In addition, the shrine published a pamphlet stating that \"<nowiki>[war]</nowiki> was necessary in order for us to protect the independence of Japan and to prosper together with our Asian neighbors\" and that the war criminals were \"cruelly and unjustly tried as war criminals by a sham-like tribunal of the Allied forces\". While it is true that the fairness of these trials is disputed among jurists and historians in the West as well as in Japan, the former [[Prime Minister of Japan]], Junichiro Koizumi, has visited the shrine five times; every visit caused immense uproar in China and South Korea. His successor, Shinzo Abe, was also a regular visitor of Yasukuni. Some Japanese politicians have responded by saying that the shrine, as well as visits to it, is protected by the constitutional right of freedom of religion. [[Yasuo Fukuda]], chosen Prime Minister in September 2007, promised \"not to visit\" Yasukuni.<ref>Blaine Harden, \"[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/23/AR2007092300112.html Party Elder To Be Japan's New Premier]\", ''Washington Post'', 24 September 2007</ref>\n\n==Derogatory terms==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2019}}\nThere are a variety of derogatory terms referring to Japan. Many of these terms are viewed as [[racism|racist]]. However, these terms do not necessarily refer to the Japanese race as a whole; they can also refer to specific policies, or specific time periods in history.\n\n===In English===\n*Especially prevalent during World War II, the word \"'''[[Jap]]'''\" or \"'''[[Nip]]'''\" (short for ''Nippon'', [[Japanese language|Japanese]] for \"Japan\") has been used in the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]] as a derogatory word for the Japanese. Tojo is also a racial slur from World War 2, but has since died out.\n\n===In Chinese===\n*'''''[[Riben guizi]]''''' ({{lang-zh|\u65e5\u672c\u9b3c\u5b50}}; Cantonese: Yaatboon gwaizi; [[Pinyin|Mandarin]]: R\u00ecb\u011bn gu\u01d0zi) \u2013 literally \"Japanese devils\" or \"Japanese monsters\". This is used mostly in the context of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], when Japan invaded and occupied large areas of China. This is the title of [[Japanese Devils|a Japanese documentary on Japanese war crimes during WWII]]. Recently, some Japanese have taken the slur and reversed the negative connotations by transforming it into a cute female personification named [[Hinomoto Oniko]], which is an alternate reading in Japanese.\n*'''''[[Wokou]]''''' ({{lang-zh|\u502d\u5bc7}}; {{lang-zh|p=w\u014dk\u00f2u}}) \u2013 originally referred to [[Wokou|Japanese pirates]] and armed sea merchants who raided the Chinese coastline during the [[Ming dynasty]]. The term was adopted during the Second Sino-Japanese War to refer to invading Japanese forces (similarly to [[Nazi Germany|Germans]] being called \"[[Hun]]s\"). The word is today sometimes used to refer to all Japanese people in extremely negative contexts.\n*'''''[[Xiao Riben]]''''' ({{lang-zh|\u5c0f\u65e5\u672c}}; {{lang-zh|p=xi\u01ceo R\u00ecb\u011bn}}) \u2013 literally \"puny Japan(ese)\", or literally \"little Japan(ese)\". This term is very common ([[Google]] Search returns 21,000,000 results as of August 2007). The term can be used to refer to either Japan or individual Japanese people.\n*'''''Riben zai''''' ({{lang-zh|\u65e5\u672c\u4ed4}}; Cantonese: Yaatboon zai; [[pinyin|Mandarin]]: R\u00ecb\u011bn z\u01cei) \u2013 this is the most common term in use by Cantonese speaking Chinese, having similar meaning to the English word \"Jap\". The term literally translates to \"Japan kid\". This term has become so common that it has little impact and does not seem to be too derogatory compared to other words below.\n*'''''Wo''''' ({{lang-zh|\u502d}}; {{lang-zh|p=w\u014d}}) \u2013 this was an ancient Chinese name for Japan, but was also adopted by the Japanese. Today, its usage in Mandarin is usually intended to give a negative connotation. The character is said to also mean \"dwarf\", although that meaning was not apparent when the name was first used. See [[Wa (Japan)#Etymology|Wa]].\n*'''''Riben gou''''' ({{lang-zh|\u65e5\u672c\u72d7}}; Cantonese: Yatboon gau; {{lang-zh|p=R\u00ecb\u011bn g\u01d2u}}) \u2013 \"Japanese dogs\". The word is used to refer to all Japanese people in extremely negative contexts.\n*'''''Da jiaopen zu''''' ({{lang-zh|\u5927\u8173\u76c6\u65cf}}; {{lang-zh|p=d\u00e0 ji\u01ceop\u00e9n z\u00fa}}) \u2013 \"big foot-basin race\". Ethnic slur towards Japanese used predominantly by Northern Chinese, mainly those from the city of [[Tianjin]].\n*'''''Huang jun''''' ({{lang-zh|\u9ec3\u8ecd}}; {{lang-zh|p=hu\u00e1ng j\u016bn}}) \u2013 \"Yellow Army\", a pun on \"\u7687\u8ecd\" (homophone ''hu\u00e1ng j\u016bn'', \"Imperial Army\"), used during World War II to represent [[Imperial Japanese Army|Imperial Japanese soldiers]] due to the colour of the uniform. Today, it is used negatively against all Japanese. Since the stereotype of Japanese soldiers are commonly portrayed in war-related TV series in China as short men, with a toothbrush moustache (and sometimes round glasses, in the case of higher ranks), ''huang jun'' is also often used to pull jokes on Chinese people with these characteristics, and thus \"appear like\" Japanese soldiers. Also, since the colour of yellow is often associated with pornography in modern Chinese, it is also a mockery of the Japanese [[comfort women|forcing women into prostitution]] during World War II.\n*'''''Zi wei dui''''' ({{lang-zh|\u81ea\u6170\u968a}}; Cantonese: zi wai dui; {{lang-zh|p=z\u00ec w\u00e8i du\u00ec}}) \u2013 a pun on the homophone \"\u81ea\u885b\u968a\" (same pronunciation, \"self-defense forces\", see [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]]), the definition of \"\u6170\" (Cantonese: wai; pinyin: ''w\u00e8i'') used is \"to comfort\". This phrase is used to refer to Japanese (whose military force is known as \"\u81ea\u885b\u968a\") being [[Stereotypes of East Asians#Predators of white women|stereotypically hypersexual]], as \"\u81ea\u6170\u968a\" means \"self-comforting forces\", referring to [[masturbation]].\n*'''''Ga zai''''' / '''''Ga mui''''' ({{lang-zh|\u67b6\u4ed4 / \u67b6\u59b9}}; Cantonese: ga zai / ga mui) \u2013 used only by Cantonese speakers to call Japanese men / young girls. \"\u67b6\" (''ga'') came from the frequent use of simple vowels (''-a'' in this case) in Japanese language. \"\u4ed4\" (''jai'') means \"little boy(s)\", with relations to the stereotype of short Japanese men. \"\u59b9\" (''mui'') means \"young girl(s)\" (the speaker usually uses a lustful tone), with relations to the stereotype of disrespect to female in Japanese society. Sometimes, ''ga'' is used as an adjective to avoid using the proper word \"Japanese\".\n*'''''Law baak tau''''' ({{lang-zh|\u863f\u8514\u982d}}; Cantonese: law baak tau; {{lang-zh|p=luo bo tou}}) \u2013 \"[[daikon]] head\". Commonly used by the older people in the Cantonese-speaking world to call Japanese men.\n\n===In Korean===\n*'''''[[Jjokbari]]''''' ({{ko-hhrm|\ucabd\ubc1c\uc774}}) \u2013 translates as \"a person with cloven hoof-like feet\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://krdic.naver.com/detail.nhn?docid=36450500|title=Definition of Jjokbari|publisher=Naver Korean Dictionary|quote=a derogatory term for Japanese.

As early as the late 19th century, Asian immigrants were subject to racial prejudice in the United States. Laws were passed that openly discriminated against Asians, and sometimes Japanese in particular. Many of these laws stated that Asians could not become citizens of the United States and could not hold basic rights, such as owning land. These laws were greatly detrimental to the newly arrived immigrants, since many of them were farmers and had little choice but to become migrant workers. Some cite the formation of the [[Asiatic Exclusion League]] as the start of the anti-Japanese movement in California.<ref>{{Cite book\n|author=Brian Niiya\n|title=Japanese American history: an A-to-Z reference from 1868 to the present\n|edition=illustrated\n|publisher=Verlag f\u00fcr die Deutsche Wirtschaft AG\n|year=1993\n|isbn=978-0-8160-2680-7\n|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=QZg6Ft_jvJ0C&pg=PA37#PRA1\u2013PA37,M1 37], [https://books.google.com/books?id=QZg6Ft_jvJ0C&pg=RA1\u2013PA103 103\u2013104]\n|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QZg6Ft_jvJ0C\n|ref=harv\n|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>\n\n====Early 20th century====\n[[File:San Francisco Chinatown Welcome.jpg|thumb|Young China Club warning to American visitors against buying Japanese goods in San Francisco's Chinatown c. 1940]]\n\nAnti-Japanese racism and [[Yellow Peril]] in California had intensified after the Japanese victory over the [[Russian Empire]] in the [[Russo-Japanese War]]. On 11 October 1906, the San Francisco, California Board of Education had passed a regulation whereby children of Japanese descent would be required to attend racially segregated separate schools. At the time, Japanese immigrants made up approximately 1% of the population of California; many of them had come under the treaty in 1894 which had assured free immigration from Japan.\n\nThe invasion of China in 1931 and the conquest of [[Manchuria]] was roundly criticized in the US. In addition, efforts by citizens outraged at Japanese atrocities, such as the [[Nanking Massacre]], led to calls for American economic intervention to encourage Japan to leave China; these calls played a role in shaping American foreign policy. As more and more unfavorable reports of Japanese actions came to the attention of the American government, embargoes on oil and other supplies were placed on Japan, out of concern for the Chinese populace and for American interests in the Pacific. Furthermore, the European American population became very pro-China and anti-Japan, an example being a grass-roots campaign for women to stop buying silk stockings, because the material was procured from Japan through its colonies.\n\nWhen the [[Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945)|Second Sino-Japanese War]] broke out in 1937, Western public opinion was decidedly pro-China, with eyewitness reports by Western journalists on atrocities committed against Chinese civilians further strengthening anti-Japanese sentiments. African American sentiments could be quite different than the mainstream, with organizations like the [[Pacific Movement of the Eastern World]] (PMEW) which promised equality and land distribution under Japanese rule. The PMEW had thousands of members hopefully preparing for liberation from white supremacy with the arrival of the [[Japanese Imperial Army]].\n\n====During World War II====\n[[File:Alaska Death Trap.jpg|left|upright|thumb|An American propaganda poster - \"Death-trap for the Jap.\"]]\n[[File:JapaneseAmericanGrocer1942.jpg|left|upright|thumb|A Japanese American unfurled this banner the day after the Pearl Harbor attack. The man was later detained nonetheless. This [[Dorothea Lange]] photograph was taken in March 1942, just prior to the [[Japanese American internment]].]]\n\nThe most profound cause of anti-Japanese sentiment outside of Asia had its beginning in the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. The Japanese attack propelled the United States into World War II.

Fanning the flames of outrage were the treatment of American and other [[POW|prisoners of war]] (POWs). Military-related outrages included the murder of POWs, the use of POWs as slave labor for Japanese industries, the [[Bataan Death March]], the [[kamikaze]] attacks on Allied ships, and atrocities committed on [[Wake Island]] and elsewhere.\n\nU.S. historian James J. Weingartner attributes the very low number of Japanese in U.S. POW compounds to two key factors: a Japanese reluctance to surrender and a widespread American \"conviction that the Japanese were 'animals' or 'subhuman' and unworthy of the normal treatment accorded to POWs.\"<ref name=Weingartner1992p55>{{harvnb|Weingartner|1992|p=55}}</ref> The latter reasoning is supported by [[Niall Ferguson]], who says that \"Allied troops often saw the Japanese in the same way that Germans regarded Russians [sic] &mdash; as [[Untermensch]]en.\"<ref>Niall Fergusson, \"Prisoner Taking and Prisoner Killing in the Age of Total War: Towards a Political Economy of Military Defeat\", ''War in History'', 2004, 11 (2): p.182</ref> Weingartner believes this explains the fact that a mere 604 Japanese captives were alive in Allied POW camps by October 1944.<ref name=Weingartner1992p54 />\nUlrich Straus, a U.S. [[Japanology|Japanologist]], believes that front line troops intensely hated Japanese military personnel and were \"not easily persuaded\" to take or protect prisoners, as they believed that Allied personnel who surrendered, got \"no mercy\" from the Japanese.<ref name=Ulrich-Straus-116>[https://books.google.com/books?id=x1dQwuiEU3UC&pg=PA206&lpg=PA206&dq=%22japanese+pows%22+american+hands&source=web&ots=Jy7xIG7C1S&sig=J2I027gBjV9cqjD7t3h1-FiQW3o#PPA116,M1 Ulrich Straus, ''The Anguish Of Surrender: Japanese POWs of World War II'' (excerpts)] Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2003 {{ISBN|978-0-295-98336-3}}, p.116</ref> Allied soldiers believed that Japanese soldiers were inclined to feign surrender, in order to make surprise attacks.<ref name=Ulrich-Straus-116/> Therefore, according to Straus, \"[s]enior officers opposed the taking of prisoners[,] on the grounds that it needlessly exposed American troops to risks&nbsp;...\"<ref name=Ulrich-Straus-116/>\n\n[[File:Salvage Scrap propaganda poster crop2.jpg|thumb|upright|An American propaganda poster from World War II produced under the [[Works Progress Administration]].]]\n\nAn estimated 112,000 to 120,000 Japanese migrants and [[Japanese American]]s from the West Coast were [[Japanese American internment|interned]] regardless of their attitude to the US or Japan.

Nowhere was this more visible than in the automobile industry, where the lethargic [[Big Three (automobile manufacturers)|Big Three]] ([[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]], [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], and [[Chrysler Corporation|Chrysler]]) watched as their former customers bought Japanese imports from [[Honda]], [[Subaru]], [[Mazda]], and [[Nissan]], a consequence of the [[1973 oil crisis|1973]] and [[1979 energy crisis]]. (When Japanese automakers were establishing their inroads into the USA and Canada. Isuzu, Mazda, and Mitsubishi had joint partnerships with a Big Three manufacturer (GM, Ford, and Chrysler) where its products were sold as [[captive import|captives]]). The anti-Japanese sentiment manifested itself in occasional public destruction of Japanese cars, and in the 1982 [[murder of Vincent Chin]], a [[Chinese American]] beaten to death when he was mistaken to be Japanese.\n\nOther highly symbolic deals \u2014 including the sale of famous American commercial and cultural symbols such as [[Columbia Records]], [[Columbia Pictures]], [[7-Eleven]], and the [[Rockefeller Center]] building to Japanese firms \u2014 further fanned anti-Japanese sentiment.\n\nPopular culture of the period reflected American's growing distrust of Japan.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Futuristic period pieces such as ''[[Back to the Future Part II]]'' and ''[[RoboCop 3]]'' frequently showed Americans as working precariously under Japanese superiors. The film ''[[Blade Runner]]'' showed a futuristic Los Angeles clearly under Japanese domination (with a Japanese majority population and culture), perhaps a reference to the alternate world presented in ''[[The Man in the High Castle]]'' written by [[Philip K. Dick]], the same author on which the film was based, in which Japan had won World War II. Criticism was also lobbied in many novels of the day. Author [[Michael Crichton]] wrote ''[[Rising Sun (novel)|Rising Sun]]'', a [[murder mystery]] (later made into a [[Rising Sun (film)|feature film]]) involving Japanese businessmen in the U.S. Likewise, in [[Tom Clancy]]'s book, ''[[Debt of Honor]]'', Clancy implies that Japan's prosperity is due primarily to unequal trading terms, and portrays Japan's business leaders acting in a power hungry cabal.\n\nAs argued by Marie Thorsten, however, Japanophobia mixed with Japanophilia during Japan's peak moments of economic dominance during the 1980s. The fear of Japan became a rallying point for techno-nationalism, the imperative to be first in the world in mathematics, science and other quantifiable measures of national strength necessary to boost technological and economic supremacy. Notorious \"Japan-bashing\" took place alongside the image of Japan as superhuman, mimicking in some ways the image of the [[Soviet Union]] after it launched the first [[Sputnik]] satellite in 1957: both events turned the spotlight on American education. American bureaucrats purposely pushed this analogy. In 1982, Ernest Boyer, a former U.S. Commissioner of Education, publicly declared that, \"What we need is another Sputnik\" to re-boot American education, and that \"maybe what we should do is get the Japanese to put a Toyota into orbit.\"<ref name=Thorsten2012p150>{{Harvnb|Thorsten|2012|p=150n1}}</ref> Japan was both a threat and a model for human resource development in education and the workforce, merging with the image of Asian-Americans as the \"model minority.\"\n\nBoth the animosity and super-humanizing which peaked in the 1980s, when the term \"Japan bashing\" became popular, had largely faded by the late 1990s. Japan's waning economic fortunes in the 1990s, known today as [[Lost Decade (Japan)|the Lost Decade]], coupled with an upsurge in the U.S. economy as the Internet took off largely crowded anti-Japanese sentiment out of the popular media.\n\n===China===\n{{Main|Anti-Japanese sentiment in China}}\n[[File:Japanese-and-dogs-are-not-allowed statement from a restaurant in Higher Education Mega Center 2007.jpg|upright|thumb|Poster outside of a restaurant in [[Guangzhou]], China]]\nAnti-Japanese sentiment is felt very strongly in China and distrust, hostility and negative feelings towards Japan, Japanese people and culture is widespread in China. Anti-Japanese sentiment is a phenomenon that mostly dates back to modern times (post-1868). Like many Western powers during the era of imperialism, Japan negotiated treaties that often resulted in the annexation of land from China towards the end of the Qing Dynasty. Dissatisfaction with Japanese settlements and the [[Twenty-One Demands]] by the Japanese government led to a serious [[boycott of Japanese products]] in China.\n\nToday, bitterness in China persists<ref>\"[https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-25411700 China and Japan: Seven decades of bitterness]\". BBC News, 13 February 2014, accessed 14 April 2014</ref> over the atrocities of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] and Japan's post-war actions, particularly the perceived lack of a straightforward acknowledgment of such atrocities, Japanese government employment of known past war criminals, and Japanese historic revisionism in textbooks. From elementary school, children are taught about Japanese war crimes in detail, for example, thousands of children are brought to the [[Museum of the War of Chinese People's Resistance Against Japanese Aggression]] in Beijing by their elementary schools to view photos of war atrocities, such as exhibits of records of Japanese military forcing Chinese workers into wartime labour,<ref>\"[http://www.1937china.org.cn/wmskz/shaiww/wwshiliao/20140407/20516.shtml]\"</ref> the [[Nanking Massacre]],<ref>\"[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/photo/2014-02/27/c_133147912.htm People visit Museum of War of Chinese People's Resistance Against Japanese Aggression in Beijing]\". Xinhuanet, 27 February 2014, accessed 14 April 2014</ref> and the issues of [[comfort women]]. After viewing the museum, the children's hatred of the Japanese people was reported to increase significantly. Despite the time that has passed since the end of the Second World War, discussions about the Japanese conduct can still evoke powerful emotions today, in part because most Japanese are aware of what happened but their society has never engaged in the type of introspection common in Germany after the Holocaust.<ref>Matthew Forney, \"[http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1139759,00.html Why China Loves to Hate Japan]\".

Nearly every Filipino family was hurt by the war on some level. Most notably in the city of [[Candaba, Pampanga|Mapanique]], survivors recount the Japanese occupation with Filipino men being massacred and dozens of women being herded to be used as comfort women. Today, the Philippines is considered to have un-antagonistic relations with Japan. In addition, Filipinos are generally not as offended as Chinese or Koreans are about the claim from some quarters that these atrocities are given little, if any, attention in Japanese classrooms. It is the result of the huge Japanese aid sent to the country during the 1960s and the 1970s.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/12/world/asia/12iht-phils.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first=Carlos H. | last=Conde | title=Letter from the Philippines: Long afterward, war still wears onFilipinos | date=13 August 2005}}</ref>\n\n[[Davao Region|Davao]] in [[Mindanao]] had a large population of Japanese immigrants who acted as a fifth column, welcoming the Japanese invaders during World War II.

Nevertheless, a significant numbers of Japanese immigrants did arrive in Australia prior to 1900 (perhaps most significantly in the town of [[Broome, Western Australia|Broome]]). By the late 1930s, Australians feared that Japanese military strength might lead to expansion in Southeast Asia and the Pacific, perhaps even [[Proposed Japanese invasion of Australia during World War II|an invasion of Australia itself]]. This resulted in a ban on [[iron ore]] exports to the Empire of Japan, from 1938. During World War II atrocities were frequently committed to Australians who surrendered (or attempted to surrender) to Japanese soldiers, most famously the ritual beheading of [[Leonard Siffleet]], which was photographed, as well as incidents of cannibalism and the shooting down of ejected pilots' parachutes. Anti-Japanese feelings were particularly provoked by the sinking of the unarmed [[AHS Centaur|Hospital Ship ''Centaur'']] (painted white and with [[Red Cross]] markings), with 268 dead. Treatment of Australians prisoners of war was also a factor, with over 2,800 Australian POWs dying on the [[Burma Railway]] alone.\n\n===Russian Empire and Soviet Union===\nIn the [[Russian Empire]], the Japanese victory in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] in 1905 halted Imperial Russia's ambitions in the East, leaving them humiliated. Later, during the [[Russian Civil War]], Japan was part of the [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|Allied interventionist forces]] that helped to occupy [[Vladivostok]] until October 1922 with a puppet White government under [[Grigory Semenov|Grigorii Semenov]]. At the end of World War II, the [[Red Army]] accepted the surrender of nearly 600,000 [[Japanese POWs in the Soviet Union|Japanese POWs]] after Emperor Hirohito announced the surrender of Japan on 15 August. Of these, 473,000 were repatriated, with 55,000 having died in Soviet captivity and the fate of the rest being unknown.

It is the resting place of thousands of not only Japanese soldiers, but also Korean and Taiwanese soldiers killed in various wars, mostly in World War II. The shrine includes 13 [[crime against peace|Class A criminals]] such as [[Hideki Tojo]] and [[K\u014dki Hirota]], who were convicted and [[execution|executed]] for their roles in the Japanese invasions of China, Korea, and other parts of East Asia after the remission to them under [[Treaty of San Francisco]]. A total of 1,068 convicted war criminals are enshrined at the Yasukuni Shrine.\n\nIn recent years, the Yasukuni Shrine has become a sticking point in the relations of Japan and its neighbours. The enshrinement of war criminals has greatly angered the people of various countries invaded by Imperial Japan. In addition, the shrine published a pamphlet stating that \"<nowiki>[war]</nowiki> was necessary in order for us to protect the independence of Japan and to prosper together with our Asian neighbors\" and that the war criminals were \"cruelly and unjustly tried as war criminals by a sham-like tribunal of the Allied forces\". While it is true that the fairness of these trials is disputed among jurists and historians in the West as well as in Japan, the former [[Prime Minister of Japan]], Junichiro Koizumi, has visited the shrine five times; every visit caused immense uproar in China and South Korea. His successor, Shinzo Abe, was also a regular visitor of Yasukuni. Some Japanese politicians have responded by saying that the shrine, as well as visits to it, is protected by the constitutional right of freedom of religion. [[Yasuo Fukuda]], chosen Prime Minister in September 2007, promised \"not to visit\" Yasukuni.<ref>Blaine Harden, \"[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/23/AR2007092300112.html Party Elder To Be Japan's New Premier]\", ''Washington Post'', 24 September 2007</ref>\n\n==Derogatory terms==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2019}}\nThere are a variety of derogatory terms referring to Japan. Many of these terms are viewed as [[racism|racist]]. However, these terms do not necessarily refer to the Japanese race as a whole; they can also refer to specific policies, or specific time periods in history.\n\n===In English===\n*Especially prevalent during World War II, the word \"'''[[Jap]]'''\" or \"'''[[Nip]]'''\" (short for ''Nippon'', [[Japanese language|Japanese]] for \"Japan\") has been used in the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]] as a derogatory word for the Japanese. Tojo is also a racial slur from World War 2, but has since died out.\n\n===In Chinese===\n*'''''[[Riben guizi]]''''' ({{lang-zh|\u65e5\u672c\u9b3c\u5b50}}; Cantonese: Yaatboon gwaizi; [[Pinyin|Mandarin]]: R\u00ecb\u011bn gu\u01d0zi) \u2013 literally \"Japanese devils\" or \"Japanese monsters\". This is used mostly in the context of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], when Japan invaded and occupied large areas of China. This is the title of [[Japanese Devils|a Japanese documentary on Japanese war crimes during WWII]]. Recently, some Japanese have taken the slur and reversed the negative connotations by transforming it into a cute female personification named [[Hinomoto Oniko]], which is an alternate reading in Japanese.\n*'''''[[Wokou]]''''' ({{lang-zh|\u502d\u5bc7}}; {{lang-zh|p=w\u014dk\u00f2u}}) \u2013 originally referred to [[Wokou|Japanese pirates]] and armed sea merchants who raided the Chinese coastline during the [[Ming dynasty]]. The term was adopted during the Second Sino-Japanese War to refer to invading Japanese forces (similarly to [[Nazi Germany|Germans]] being called \"[[Hun]]s\"). The word is today sometimes used to refer to all Japanese people in extremely negative contexts.\n*'''''[[Xiao Riben]]''''' ({{lang-zh|\u5c0f\u65e5\u672c}}; {{lang-zh|p=xi\u01ceo R\u00ecb\u011bn}}) \u2013 literally \"puny Japan(ese)\", or literally \"little Japan(ese)\". This term is very common ([[Google]] Search returns 21,000,000 results as of August 2007). The term can be used to refer to either Japan or individual Japanese people.\n*'''''Riben zai''''' ({{lang-zh|\u65e5\u672c\u4ed4}}; Cantonese: Yaatboon zai; [[pinyin|Mandarin]]: R\u00ecb\u011bn z\u01cei) \u2013 this is the most common term in use by Cantonese speaking Chinese, having similar meaning to the English word \"Jap\". The term literally translates to \"Japan kid\". This term has become so common that it has little impact and does not seem to be too derogatory compared to other words below.\n*'''''Wo''''' ({{lang-zh|\u502d}}; {{lang-zh|p=w\u014d}}) \u2013 this was an ancient Chinese name for Japan, but was also adopted by the Japanese. Today, its usage in Mandarin is usually intended to give a negative connotation. The character is said to also mean \"dwarf\", although that meaning was not apparent when the name was first used. See [[Wa (Japan)#Etymology|Wa]].\n*'''''Riben gou''''' ({{lang-zh|\u65e5\u672c\u72d7}}; Cantonese: Yatboon gau; {{lang-zh|p=R\u00ecb\u011bn g\u01d2u}}) \u2013 \"Japanese dogs\". The word is used to refer to all Japanese people in extremely negative contexts.\n*'''''Da jiaopen zu''''' ({{lang-zh|\u5927\u8173\u76c6\u65cf}}; {{lang-zh|p=d\u00e0 ji\u01ceop\u00e9n z\u00fa}}) \u2013 \"big foot-basin race\". Ethnic slur towards Japanese used predominantly by Northern Chinese, mainly those from the city of [[Tianjin]].\n*'''''Huang jun''''' ({{lang-zh|\u9ec3\u8ecd}}; {{lang-zh|p=hu\u00e1ng j\u016bn}}) \u2013 \"Yellow Army\", a pun on \"\u7687\u8ecd\" (homophone ''hu\u00e1ng j\u016bn'', \"Imperial Army\"), used during World War II to represent [[Imperial Japanese Army|Imperial Japanese soldiers]] due to the colour of the uniform. Today, it is used negatively against all Japanese. Since the stereotype of Japanese soldiers are commonly portrayed in war-related TV series in China as short men, with a toothbrush moustache (and sometimes round glasses, in the case of higher ranks), ''huang jun'' is also often used to pull jokes on Chinese people with these characteristics, and thus \"appear like\" Japanese soldiers. Also, since the colour of yellow is often associated with pornography in modern Chinese, it is also a mockery of the Japanese [[comfort women|forcing women into prostitution]] during World War II.\n*'''''Zi wei dui''''' ({{lang-zh|\u81ea\u6170\u968a}}; Cantonese: zi wai dui; {{lang-zh|p=z\u00ec w\u00e8i du\u00ec}}) \u2013 a pun on the homophone \"\u81ea\u885b\u968a\" (same pronunciation, \"self-defense forces\", see [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]]), the definition of \"\u6170\" (Cantonese: wai; pinyin: ''w\u00e8i'') used is \"to comfort\". This phrase is used to refer to Japanese (whose military force is known as \"\u81ea\u885b\u968a\") being [[Stereotypes of East Asians#Predators of white women|stereotypically hypersexual]], as \"\u81ea\u6170\u968a\" means \"self-comforting forces\", referring to [[masturbation]].\n*'''''Ga zai''''' / '''''Ga mui''''' ({{lang-zh|\u67b6\u4ed4 / \u67b6\u59b9}}; Cantonese: ga zai / ga mui) \u2013 used only by Cantonese speakers to call Japanese men / young girls. \"\u67b6\" (''ga'') came from the frequent use of simple vowels (''-a'' in this case) in Japanese language. \"\u4ed4\" (''jai'') means \"little boy(s)\", with relations to the stereotype of short Japanese men. \"\u59b9\" (''mui'') means \"young girl(s)\" (the speaker usually uses a lustful tone), with relations to the stereotype of disrespect to female in Japanese society. Sometimes, ''ga'' is used as an adjective to avoid using the proper word \"Japanese\".\n*'''''Law baak tau''''' ({{lang-zh|\u863f\u8514\u982d}}; Cantonese: law baak tau; {{lang-zh|p=luo bo tou}}) \u2013 \"[[daikon]] head\". Commonly used by the older people in the Cantonese-speaking world to call Japanese men.\n\n===In Korean===\n*'''''[[Jjokbari]]''''' ({{ko-hhrm|\ucabd\ubc1c\uc774}}) \u2013 translates as \"a person with cloven hoof-like feet\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://krdic.naver.com/detail.nhn?docid=36450500|title=Definition of Jjokbari|publisher=Naver Korean Dictionary|quote=a derogatory term for Japanese.

Instead, a customer would give a list of items to a clerk, who would then go through the store, gathering them. This created a greater cost, and therefore higher prices. Piggly Wiggly introduced the innovation of allowing customers to go through the store, gathering their own goods, thus cutting costs and lowering prices.<ref name=\"Piggly Wiggly: About Us\" /> Losses due to easier shoplifting were more than offset by profits from increased impulse purchasing.

At its peak in 1932 (see [[Clarence Saunders (grocer)|Clarence Saunders]]), the company operated 2,660 stores and posted annual sales in excess of $180&nbsp;million. In November 1922, Saunders attempted a squeeze on the substantial short interest in the stock, running the [[share (finance)|share]] price up from 40 to 120 and profiting by millions on paper. The Stock Exchange Governors responded by deciding that a [[Cornering the market|corner]] had been established in Piggly Wiggly and removed the stock from the Board, eventually forcing Saunders to turn over his assets to the banks that had financed his leveraged position.

[[Sustainability]] in [[fisheries]] combines theoretical disciplines, such as the [[population dynamics of fisheries]], with practical strategies, such as avoiding [[overfishing]] through techniques such as [[IFQ|individual fishing quotas]], curtailing [[destructive fishing practices|destructive]] and [[Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing|illegal fishing practices]] by lobbying for appropriate law and policy, setting up protected areas, restoring collapsed fisheries, incorporating all externalities involved in harvesting marine ecosystems into fishery economics, educating stakeholders and the wider public, and developing independent certification programs.\n\nSome primary concerns around sustainability are that heavy fishing pressures, such as [[overexploitation]] and [[Growth overfishing|growth]] or [[recruitment overfishing]], will result in the loss of significant [[sustainable yield|potential yield]]; that [[Fish stock|stock]] structure will erode to the point where it loses diversity and resilience to environmental fluctuations; that ecosystems and their economic infrastructures will cycle between collapse and recovery; with each cycle less productive than its predecessor; and that changes will occur in the [[Trophic level|trophic]] balance  ([[fishing down marine food webs]]).<ref name=\"Hilborn2005\">\n[[Ray Hilborn|Hilborn, Ray]] (2005) [https://books.google.com/books?id=J-2JcCC_Yn0C&pg=PP1 \"Are Sustainable Fisheries Achievable?\"] Chapter 15, pp. 247\u2013259, in Norse and Crowder (2005).</ref>\n\n==Overview==\n{{quotebox|''Sustainable management of fisheries cannot be achieved without an acceptance that the long-term goals of fisheries management are the same as those of environmental conservation''|[[Daniel Pauly]] and Dave Preikshot|<ref name=\"Preikshot&Pauly2005\">\nPreikshot, Dave and [[Daniel Pauly|Pauly, Daniel]] (2005) [https://books.google.com/books?id=J-2JcCC_Yn0C&pg=PA185 \"Global Fisheries and Marine Conservation: Is Coexistence Possible?\"] Chapter 11, pp. 185\u2013197, in Norse and Crowder (2005).</ref> |width  = 30% |align  = right}}\n\nGlobal [[wild fisheries]] are believed to have peaked and begun a decline, with valuable habitats, such as [[estuaries]] and [[coral reef]]s, in critical condition.<ref>[[Tietenberg, Tom]] (2006) ''Environmental and Natural Resource Economics: A Contemporary Approach''.

At the time of Huxley's address, the Atlantic [[halibut]] fishery had already collapsed (and has never recovered).<ref>\nGoode GB and Collins JW (1887) \"The fresh-halibut fishery\".

These scientists dismissed conservation issues and distanced themselves from the scientists and the science that raised the issues. This happened even as commercial fish stocks deteriorated, and even though many governments were signatories to binding conservation agreements.<ref name=\"Preikshot&Pauly2005\" />\n\n==Defining sustainability==\n\n[[Ray Hilborn]], of the [[University of Washington]], distinguishes three ways of defining a sustainable fishery:\n\n* ''Long term constant yield'' is the idea that undisturbed nature establishes a steady state that changes little over time. Properly done, fishing at up to [[maximum sustainable yield]] allows nature to adjust to a new steady state, without compromising future harvests. However, this view is naive, because constancy is not an attribute of marine ecosystems, which dooms this approach.

This is a way of operating farms so they restore the [[food chain]] in their area. Re-establishing a healthy food chain can result in the farm automatically filtering out impurities from feed water and air, feeding its own food chain, and additionally producing high net yields for harvesting. An example is the large cattle ranch [[Veta La Palma]] in southern Spain. Relationship farming was first made popular by [[Joel Salatin]] who created a 220 hectare relationship farm featured prominently in [[Michael Pollan|Michael Pollan's]] book ''[[The Omnivore's Dilemma]]'' (2006) and the documentary films, [[Food, Inc.]] and [[Fresh (2009 film)|Fresh]].

According to Hilborn, overfishing can be \"a misallocation of societies' resources\", but it does not necessarily threaten conservation or sustainability\".<ref name=\"Hilborn2005\" />\n\n[[Overfishing]] is traditionally defined as harvesting so many fish that the yield is less than it would be if fishing were reduced.<ref name=\"Hilborn2005\" /> For example, [[Pacific salmon]] are usually managed by trying to determine how many spawning salmon, called the \"[[escapement]]\", are needed each generation to produce the maximum harvestable surplus. The optimum escapement is that needed to reach that surplus. If the escapement is half the optimum, then normal fishing looks like overfishing. But this is still sustainable fishing, which could continue indefinitely at its reduced stock numbers and yield. There is a wide range of escapement sizes that present no threat that the stock might collapse or that the stock structure might erode.<ref name=\"Hilborn2005\" />\n\nOn the other hand, overfishing can precede severe stock depletion and fishery collapse.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Ludwig | first1 = D | last2 = Hilborn | first2 = R | last3 = Walter | first3 = C | year = 1993 | title = Uncertainty, resource exploitation and conservation: Lessons from history | url = http://www.bren.ucsb.edu/academics/courses/595CC/Readings/Ludwig_et_al_1993.pdf | journal = Science | volume = 230 | issue =  5104| pages = 17\u201326 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120502143728/http://www.bren.ucsb.edu/academics/courses/595CC/Readings/Ludwig_et_al_1993.pdf | archive-date = 2012-05-02 | df =  | doi = 10.1126/science.260.5104.17 | pmid = 17793516 }}</ref> Hilborn points out that continuing to exert fishing pressure while production decreases, stock collapses and the fishery fails, is largely \"the product of institutional failure.\"<ref name=\"Hilborn2005\" />\n\nToday over 70% of fish species are either fully exploited, overexploited, depleted, or recovering from depletion.

Most of the really valuable ecosystems are in relatively shallow coastal waters, above or near the [[continental shelf]], where the sunlit waters are often nutrient rich from [[land runoff]] or [[upwelling]]s at the continental edge, allowing photosynthesis, which energizes the lowest trophic levels. In the 1970s, for reasons more to do with [[oil drilling]] than with fishing, the U.S. extended its jurisdiction, then 12 miles from the coast, to 200 miles. This made huge shelf areas part of its territory. Other nations followed, extending national control to what became known as the [[exclusive economic zone]] (EEZ). This move has had many implications for fisheries conservation, since it means that most of the most productive maritime ecosystems are now under national jurisdictions, opening possibilities for protecting these ecosystems by passing appropriate laws.\n\n[[Daniel Pauly]] characterises marine protected areas as \"a conservation tool of revolutionary importance that is being incorporated into the fisheries mainstream.\"<ref name=\"Preikshot&Pauly2005\" /> [[The Pew Charitable Trusts]] have funded various initiatives aimed at encouraging the development of MPAs and other ocean conservation measures.<ref>\n[http://www.fishingnj.org/netusa17.htm Pew, SeaWeb shrug off oil to target fishing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100713131144/http://www.fishingnj.org/netusa17.htm |date=2010-07-13 }}.

He describes the way that radically depleted fisheries were evaluated by experts who used the state of the fishery at the start of their careers as the baseline, rather than the fishery in its untouched state. Areas that swarmed with a particular species hundreds of years ago, may have experienced long-term decline, but it is the level of decades previously that is considered the appropriate reference point for current populations. In this way large declines in ecosystems or species over long periods of time were, and are, masked. There is a loss of [[perception]] of change that occurs when each [[generation]] redefines what is \"natural\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.york.ac.uk/res/unnatural-history-of-the-sea/baselines/index.htm|title=The Unnatural History of the Sea|author=|date=|website=www.york.ac.uk|access-date=30 April 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160710001400/http://www.york.ac.uk/res/unnatural-history-of-the-sea/baselines/index.htm|archive-date=10 July 2016|df=}}</ref>\n\n==''Looting the seas''==\n''Looting the seas'' is the name given by the [[International Consortium of Investigative Journalists]] to a series of journalistic investigations into areas directly affecting the sustainability of fisheries.

[[Sustainability]] in [[fisheries]] combines theoretical disciplines, such as the [[population dynamics of fisheries]], with practical strategies, such as avoiding [[overfishing]] through techniques such as [[IFQ|individual fishing quotas]], curtailing [[destructive fishing practices|destructive]] and [[Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing|illegal fishing practices]] by lobbying for appropriate law and policy, setting up protected areas, restoring collapsed fisheries, incorporating all externalities involved in harvesting marine ecosystems into fishery economics, educating stakeholders and the wider public, and developing independent certification programs.\n\nSome primary concerns around sustainability are that heavy fishing pressures, such as [[overexploitation]] and [[Growth overfishing|growth]] or [[recruitment overfishing]], will result in the loss of significant [[sustainable yield|potential yield]]; that [[Fish stock|stock]] structure will erode to the point where it loses diversity and resilience to environmental fluctuations; that ecosystems and their economic infrastructures will cycle between collapse and recovery; with each cycle less productive than its predecessor; and that changes will occur in the [[Trophic level|trophic]] balance  ([[fishing down marine food webs]]).<ref name=\"Hilborn2005\">\n[[Ray Hilborn|Hilborn, Ray]] (2005) [https://books.google.com/books?id=J-2JcCC_Yn0C&pg=PP1 \"Are Sustainable Fisheries Achievable?\"] Chapter 15, pp. 247\u2013259, in Norse and Crowder (2005).</ref>\n\n==Overview==\n{{quotebox|''Sustainable management of fisheries cannot be achieved without an acceptance that the long-term goals of fisheries management are the same as those of environmental conservation''|[[Daniel Pauly]] and Dave Preikshot|<ref name=\"Preikshot&Pauly2005\">\nPreikshot, Dave and [[Daniel Pauly|Pauly, Daniel]] (2005) [https://books.google.com/books?id=J-2JcCC_Yn0C&pg=PA185 \"Global Fisheries and Marine Conservation: Is Coexistence Possible?\"] Chapter 11, pp. 185\u2013197, in Norse and Crowder (2005).</ref> |width  = 30% |align  = right}}\n\nGlobal [[wild fisheries]] are believed to have peaked and begun a decline, with valuable habitats, such as [[estuaries]] and [[coral reef]]s, in critical condition.<ref>[[Tietenberg, Tom]] (2006) ''Environmental and Natural Resource Economics: A Contemporary Approach''.

These scientists dismissed conservation issues and distanced themselves from the scientists and the science that raised the issues. This happened even as commercial fish stocks deteriorated, and even though many governments were signatories to binding conservation agreements.<ref name=\"Preikshot&Pauly2005\" />\n\n==Defining sustainability==\n\n[[Ray Hilborn]], of the [[University of Washington]], distinguishes three ways of defining a sustainable fishery:\n\n* ''Long term constant yield'' is the idea that undisturbed nature establishes a steady state that changes little over time. Properly done, fishing at up to [[maximum sustainable yield]] allows nature to adjust to a new steady state, without compromising future harvests. However, this view is naive, because constancy is not an attribute of marine ecosystems, which dooms this approach. Stock abundance fluctuates naturally, changing the potential yield over short and long-term periods.<ref name=\"Hilborn2005\" />\n* ''Preserving intergenerational equity'' acknowledges natural fluctuations and regards as unsustainable only practices which damage the [[gene]]tic structure<!--what is \"the genetic structure\"?--> [[habitat loss|destroy habitat]], or deplete [[Fish stock|stock levels]] to the point where rebuilding requires more than a single generation. Providing rebuilding takes only one generation, [[overfishing]] may be economically foolish, but it is not unsustainable. This definition is widely accepted.<ref name=\"Hilborn2005\" />\n* ''Maintaining a biological, social and economic system'' considers the health of the human ecosystem as well as the marine ecosystem. A fishery which rotates among multiple species can deplete individual stocks and still be sustainable so long as the ecosystem retains its intrinsic integrity.<!-- this term needs definition --> Such a definition might consider as sustainable fishing practices that lead to the reduction and possible extinction of some species.<ref name=\"Hilborn2005\" />\n\n===Social sustainability===\nFisheries and aquaculture are, directly or indirectly, a source of livelihood for over 500 million people, mostly in developing countries.<ref>[http://www.fao.org/fishery/docs/brochure/climate_change/policy_brief.pdf Fisheries and Aquaculture in our Changing Climate]   Policy brief of the [[FAO]] for the [[UNFCCC]] [[United Nations Climate Change Conference 2009|COP-15]] in [[Copenhagen]], December 2009.</ref>\n\nSocial sustainability can conflict with biodiversity. A fishery is socially sustainable if the fishery ecosystem maintains the ability to deliver products the society can use. Major species shifts within the ecosystem could be acceptable as long as the flow of such products continues.<ref name=\"Hilborn2005\" /> Humans have been operating such regimes for thousands of years, transforming many ecosystems, depleting or driving to extinction many species.<ref>\nJohannes R (1981) ''Words of the lagoon: Fishing and Marine Lore in the Palau District of Micronesia'', University of California Press. {{ISBN|0-520-03929-7}}</ref>\n\n{{rquote|left|''To a great extent, sustainability is like good art, it is hard to describe but we know it when we see it.''|[[Ray Hilborn]]|<ref name=\"Hilborn2005\" />}}\n\nAccording to Hilborn, the \"loss of some species, and indeed transformation of the ecosystem is not incompatible with sustainable harvests.\"<ref name=\"Hilborn2005\" /> For example, in recent years, [[barndoor skate]]s have been caught as [[bycatch]] in the western Atlantic. Their numbers have severely declined and they will probably go extinct if these catch rates continue.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.281.5377.690 |pmid=9685260 |title=Near Extinction of a Large, Widely Distributed Fish |journal=Science |volume=281 |issue=5377 |pages=690\u2013692 |year=1998 |last1=Casey |first1=J.

This is a way of operating farms so they restore the [[food chain]] in their area. Re-establishing a healthy food chain can result in the farm automatically filtering out impurities from feed water and air, feeding its own food chain, and additionally producing high net yields for harvesting. An example is the large cattle ranch [[Veta La Palma]] in southern Spain. Relationship farming was first made popular by [[Joel Salatin]] who created a 220 hectare relationship farm featured prominently in [[Michael Pollan|Michael Pollan's]] book ''[[The Omnivore's Dilemma]]'' (2006) and the documentary films, [[Food, Inc.]] and [[Fresh (2009 film)|Fresh]]. The basic concept of relationship farming is to put effort into building a healthy food chain, and then the food chain does the hard work.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Obstacles==\n[[File:Elevation.jpg|thumb|330px|left|{{legend|#03FCDE|Large areas of the global continental shelf, highlighted in cyan, have had heavy bottom trawls repeatedly dragged over them}}]]\n\n===Overfishing===\n{{main|Overfishing}}\nOverfishing can be sustainable. According to Hilborn, overfishing can be \"a misallocation of societies' resources\", but it does not necessarily threaten conservation or sustainability\".<ref name=\"Hilborn2005\" />\n\n[[Overfishing]] is traditionally defined as harvesting so many fish that the yield is less than it would be if fishing were reduced.<ref name=\"Hilborn2005\" /> For example, [[Pacific salmon]] are usually managed by trying to determine how many spawning salmon, called the \"[[escapement]]\", are needed each generation to produce the maximum harvestable surplus. The optimum escapement is that needed to reach that surplus. If the escapement is half the optimum, then normal fishing looks like overfishing. But this is still sustainable fishing, which could continue indefinitely at its reduced stock numbers and yield.

Most of the really valuable ecosystems are in relatively shallow coastal waters, above or near the [[continental shelf]], where the sunlit waters are often nutrient rich from [[land runoff]] or [[upwelling]]s at the continental edge, allowing photosynthesis, which energizes the lowest trophic levels. In the 1970s, for reasons more to do with [[oil drilling]] than with fishing, the U.S. extended its jurisdiction, then 12 miles from the coast, to 200 miles. This made huge shelf areas part of its territory. Other nations followed, extending national control to what became known as the [[exclusive economic zone]] (EEZ). This move has had many implications for fisheries conservation, since it means that most of the most productive maritime ecosystems are now under national jurisdictions, opening possibilities for protecting these ecosystems by passing appropriate laws.\n\n[[Daniel Pauly]] characterises marine protected areas as \"a conservation tool of revolutionary importance that is being incorporated into the fisheries mainstream.\"<ref name=\"Preikshot&Pauly2005\" /> [[The Pew Charitable Trusts]] have funded various initiatives aimed at encouraging the development of MPAs and other ocean conservation measures.<ref>\n[http://www.fishingnj.org/netusa17.htm Pew, SeaWeb shrug off oil to target fishing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100713131144/http://www.fishingnj.org/netusa17.htm |date=2010-07-13 }}.

According to fisheries scientist Milo Adkison (2007), the primary limitation in fisheries management decisions is poor data. Fisheries management decisions are often based on population models, but the models need quality data to be accurate. Scientists and fishery managers would be better served with simpler models and improved data.<ref>\n[[University of Alaska Fairbanks]] (2007) [http://www.sfos.uaf.edu/news/story/?ni=184 ''Adkison advocates increased fisheries data gathering''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711045411/http://www.sfos.uaf.edu/news/story/?ni=184 |date=2007-07-11 }}</ref>\n\n===Unreported fishing===\nEstimates of illegal catch losses range between $10 billion and $23 billion annually, representing between 11 and 26 million [[tonne]]s.<ref>[[UBC Fisheries Centre]] (2008) [http://www.mrag.co.uk/Documents/ExtentGlobalIllegalFishing.pdf The Global Extent of Illegal Fishing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100520161657/http://www.mrag.co.uk/Documents/ExtentGlobalIllegalFishing.pdf |date=2010-05-20 }} University of British Columbia.</ref>\n\n* [[Incidental catch]]<ref name=\"Preikshot&Pauly2005\" />\n\n===Shifting baselines===\n[[Shifting baseline]]s is the way significant changes to a system are measured against previous baselines, which themselves may represent significant changes from the original state of the system. The term was first used by the [[Fisheries science|fisheries scientist]] [[Daniel Pauly]] in his paper \"Anecdotes and the shifting baseline syndrome of fisheries\".<ref>Pauly (1995)</ref> Pauly developed the term in reference to [[fisheries management]] where fisheries scientists sometimes fail to identify the correct \"[[wiktionary:baseline|baseline]]\" population size (e.g. how abundant a fish species population was ''before'' human exploitation) and thus work with a '''shifted baseline'''. He describes the way that radically depleted fisheries were evaluated by experts who used the state of the fishery at the start of their careers as the baseline, rather than the fishery in its untouched state. Areas that swarmed with a particular species hundreds of years ago, may have experienced long-term decline, but it is the level of decades previously that is considered the appropriate reference point for current populations. In this way large declines in ecosystems or species over long periods of time were, and are, masked. There is a loss of [[perception]] of change that occurs when each [[generation]] redefines what is \"natural\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.york.ac.uk/res/unnatural-history-of-the-sea/baselines/index.htm|title=The Unnatural History of the Sea|author=|date=|website=www.york.ac.uk|access-date=30 April 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160710001400/http://www.york.ac.uk/res/unnatural-history-of-the-sea/baselines/index.htm|archive-date=10 July 2016|df=}}</ref>\n\n==''Looting the seas''==\n''Looting the seas'' is the name given by the [[International Consortium of Investigative Journalists]] to a series of journalistic investigations into areas directly affecting the sustainability of fisheries.

Other factors are sometimes  included in the broader question of sustainability.  The use of [[non-renewable resource]]s is not fully sustainable.  This might include [[diesel fuel]] for the fishing ships and boats: there is even a debate about the long term sustainability of [[biofuel]]s.  Modern [[fishing net]]s are usually made of artificial  [[polyamides]] like [[nylon]].
