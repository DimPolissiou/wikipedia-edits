This aspect of the rise of border control in the 20th century has proven controversial. The British Nationality Law 1981 has been criticised by experts,{{efn|For example, [[Ann Dummett]], an activist for racial equality, criticised the legislation, saying that \"there is no indication at all in our nationality law of ethnic origin being a criterion.

The committee criticised the arrangements of the BN(O) nationality under \"Principal subjects of concern\": \"The Government's statement that South Asian residents of Hong Kong are granted some form of British nationality, whether that of a British National Overseas (BNO) or a British Overseas Citizen (BOC), so that no resident of Hong Kong would be left stateless following the transfer of sovereignty is noted with interest. It is, however, a matter of concern that such status does not grant the bearer the right of abode in the United Kingdom and contrasts with the full citizenship status conferred upon a predominantly white population living in another dependent territory. It is noted that most of the persons holding BNO or BOC status are Asians and that judgements on applications for citizenship appear to vary according to the country of origin, which leads to the assumption that this practice reveals elements of racial discrimination.\"<ref>[http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/(Symbol)/5ff3d725d136a1fcc12563e0003dbc08?Opendocument Concluding observations of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination : United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. 28/03/96.]</ref>}} on the grounds that the different classes of British nationality it created are, in fact, closely related to the ethnic origins of their holders.\n\nThe creation of British Nationality (Overseas) status, for instance, (with fewer privileges than British citizen status) was met with criticism from many Hong Kong residents who felt that British citizenship would have been more appropriate in light of the \"moral debt\" owed to them by the UK.{{efn|For example, the legislative councilor [[Henrietta Ip Man-Hing|Dr Henrietta Ip]] criticised the idea of British National (Overseas) and again urged the UK Parliament, to grant full British citizenship to Hong Kong's British nationals in the council meeting held on 5 July 1989, saying that \"we were born and live under British rule on British land.... It is therefore... our right to ask that you should give us back a place of abode so that we can continue to live under British rule on British land if we so wish.... I represent most of all those who live here to firmly request and demand you to grant us the right to full British citizenship so that we can, if we so wish, live in the United Kingdom, our Motherland... I say to you that the right of abode in the United Kingdom is the best and the only definitive guarantee....'' With your failure to give us such a guarantee, reluctant as I may, I must advise the people of Hong Kong, and urgently now, each to seek for themselves a home of last resort even if they have to leave to do so''. I do so because, as a legislator, my duty is with the people first and the stability and prosperity of Hong Kong second, although the two are so interdependent on each other....\"}}{{efn|The legislation is sometimes compared with [[Macau]], a former colony of Portugal, where many residents of Chinese descent were granted right of abode in Portugal when Macau was still under colonial rule. They were not deprived of their right of abode after the [[transfer of sovereignty of Macau]] in 1999, their [[Portuguese passport]]s and citizenship are valid and inheritable, and it turned out that many of them still choose to stay in Macau.}} Some British politicians{{efn|Then [[Shadow Home Secretary]], [[Jack Straw (politician)|Jack Straw]], said in a letter to the then [[Home Secretary]] [[Michael Howard]] dated 30 January 1997 that a claim that British National (Overseas) status amounts to British nationality \"is pure [[sophistry]]\".<ref>[http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/news/release?id=48962 \"Labour call for British citizenship for Hong Kong ethnic Asians\"], ''PR Newswire Europe Ltd.'', 1997.</ref>}} and magazines{{efn|''The Economist'' also wrote critically in an article published on 3 July 1997 that \"the failure to offer citizenship to most of Hong Kong\u2019s residents was shameful\", and \"it was the height of cynicism to hand 6m people over to a regime of proven brutality without allowing them any means to move elsewhere.\" The article commented that the real reason that the new [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour government]] still refused to give full British citizenship to other British Dependent Territories Citizens in around 1997 \u2013 because the United Kingdom was waiting until Hong Kong had been disposed of \u2013 \"would be seen as highly cynical\", as [[Elizabeth Symons, Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean|Baroness Symons]], a [[Foreign Office]] minister, has conceded.<ref>\"Britain\u2019s colonial obligations\", ''The Economist'', 3 July 1997.</ref>}} also criticised the creation of BN(O) status.\n\nEthnic tensions created during colonial occupation also resulted in discriminatory policies being adopted in newly independent African nations, such as Uganda under [[Idi Amin]] which banned [[Expulsion of Asians from Uganda|Asians from Uganda]], thus creating a mass exodus of the (largely Gujarati<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/international/story/19790515-hopes-soar-among-ugandan-asians-as-idi-amin-dictatorial-regime-falls-822011-2014-02-28|title=Hopes soar among Ugandan Asians as Idi Amin's dictatorial regime falls|date=February 28, 2014|first=K|last=Srinivas|magazine=India Today}}</ref><ref name=toi>{{cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/Gujaratis-survived-Idi-Amin-fuelled-East-Africas-economy/articleshow/3625352.cms|title=Gujaratis survived Idi Amin, fuelled East Africa's economy|date=October 22, 2008|first1=Ashish|last1=Vashi|first2=Ankur|last2=Jain|newspaper=The Times of India}}</ref>) Asian community of Uganda. Such ethnically driven border control policies took forms ranging from anti-Asian sentiment in East Africa to [[Apartheid]] policies in South Africa and Namibia (then known as [[Southwest Africa]] under South African rule) which creates [[bantustan]]s{{efn|Bantustans within the borders of South Africa were classified as \"self-governing\" or \"independent\" and theoretically had some sovereign powers. Independent Bantustans (Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda and Ciskei; also known as the TBVC states) were intended to be fully sovereign. In reality, they had no economic infrastructure worth mentioning and with few exceptions encompassed swaths of disconnected territory. This meant all the Bantustans were little more than puppet states controlled by South Africa. Throughout the existence of the independent Bantustans, South Africa remained the only country to recognise their independence. Nevertheless, internal organisations of many countries, as well as the South African government, lobbied for their recognition.

Zimbabwe was unconvinced, and the barrier remains a source of tension.<ref>{{Cite news|periodical=BBC News|title=Zimbabwe crisis spills over border|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3582459.stm|last=Phillips|first=Barnaby|date=2004-03-30 | accessdate=January 4, 2010}}</ref>\n\n====Border zones====\n[[File:Lo Wu Restricted Area Sign.JPG|thumb|right|160px|Frontier Closed Area signboard at [[Lo Wu]]]]\n[[File:\u0417\u0430\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435, \u041a\u0421\u041f \u0438 \u0414\u041e\u0422 \u043d\u0430 \u0431\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e-\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0435 01.jpg|right|thumb|140px|Border zone in [[Brest, Belarus|Brest]] with a [[Security alarm#Security electric fence|security electric fence]], a ploughed trace-control strip and a [[Pillbox (military)|pillbox]].]]\n\n[[File:Finnish border zone sign on a tree.jpg|thumb|left|130px|Border zone marked on a tree on the [[Finland\u2013Russia border]]: no entry.]]\n\nBorder zones are areas near borders that have special restrictions on movement. Governments may forbid unauthorised entry to or exit from border zones and restrict property ownership in the area. The zones function as [[buffer zone]]s specifically monitored by [[border guard|border patrols]] in order to prevent illegal entry or exit. Restricting entry aids in pinpointing illegal intruders, since by ''[[nulla poena sine lege]]'' (\"no penalty without a law\"), any person could be present in the area near the border, and illegal intruders, such as illegal immigrants, smugglers or spies could blend in. However, if all unauthorised presence is forbidden, their mere presence of intruders allows the authorities to arrest them. Border zones between hostile states can be heavily militarised, with [[minefield]]s, barbed wire and [[watchtower]]s. Some border zones are designed to prevent illegal immigration or emigration, and do not have many restrictions but may operate checkpoints to check immigration status. In most places, a [[border vista]] is usually included and/or required. In some nations, movement inside a border zone without a licence is an offence and will result in arrest. No probable cause is required as mere presence inside the zone is an offence, if it is intentional.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.minilex.fi/a/valtionrajarikos-koskee-suomen-rajaa |title=Valtionrajarikos koskee Suomen rajaa - Minilex |accessdate=2016-09-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609210740/http://www.minilex.fi/a/valtionrajarikos-koskee-suomen-rajaa |archivedate=2016-06-09 }}</ref> Even with a licence to enter, photography, making fires, and carrying of firearms and hunting are prohibited.\n\nExamples of international border zones are the [[Border Security Zone of Russia]] and the Finnish border zone on the [[Finnish\u2013Russian border]]. There are also intra-country zones such as the [[Cactus Curtain]] surrounding the [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base]] in Cuba, the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone|Korean Demilitarised Zone]] along the [[North Korea]]-[[South Korea]] demarcation line and the [[Frontier Closed Area]] in [[Hong Kong]]. Important historical examples are the [[Wire of Death]] set up by [[the German Empire]] to control the [[Belgium\u2013Netherlands border]] and the [[Iron Curtain]], a set of border zones maintained by the Soviet Union and its satellite states along their borders with Western states. One of the most militarised parts was the [[Inner German border#Restricted zone|restricted zone of the inner German border]]. While initially and officially the zone was for border security, eventually it was engineered to prevent escape from the Soviet sphere into the West. Ultimately, the [[Eastern Bloc|Soviet Bloc]] governments resorted to using lethal countermeasures against those trying to cross the border, such as mined fences and orders to shoot anyone trying to cross into the West. The restrictions on building and habitation made the area a \"green corridor\", today established as the [[European Green Belt]].\n\nIn the area stretching inwards from its [[Border control#Internal border controls|internal border]] with the [[Mainland China|mainland]], Hong Kong maintains a [[Frontier Closed Area]] [[Exclusion zone|out of bounds]] to those without special authorisation. The area was established in the 1950s when Hong Kong under British occupation as a consequence of the [[Treaty of Nanjing]] during the [[Opium Wars]], prior to the [[Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong]] in 1997. The purposes of the area were to prevent illegal immigration and smuggling; smuggling had become prevalent as a consequence of the Korean war. Today, under the [[one country, two systems]] policy, the area continues to be used to curtail unauthorised migration to Hong Kong and the smuggling of goods in either direction.\n\n[[File:DMZ from North Korea side (14319637755).jpg|left|thumb|125px|Korean Demilitarised Zone as seen from the North]]\n\nAs a result of the partition of the Korean peninsula by America and the Soviet Union after World War II, and exacerbated by the subsequent [[Korean war]], there is a [[Korean Demilitarized Zone|Demilitarised Zone]] spanning the [[de facto]] border between [[North Korea|North]] and [[South Korea]]. The Demilitarised Zone follows the effective boundaries as of the end of the Korean War in 1953. Similarly to the Frontier Closed Area in Hong Kong, this zone and the defence apparatus that exists on both sides of the border serve to curtail unauthorised passage between the two sides. In South Korea, there is an additional fenced-off area between the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone#Civilian Control Line|Civilian Control Line]] and the start of the Demilitarised Zone, further strengthening border security\n\n===Immigration policy===\nImmigration policy is the aspect of border control concerning the transit of people into a country, especially those that intend to stay and work in the country. Often, racial or religious bias is tied to immigration policy. Taxation, tariff and trade rules set out what goods immigrants may bring with them, and what services they may perform while temporarily in the country. [[Investment policy]] sometimes permits wealthy immigrants to invest in businesses in exchange for favourable treatment and eventual naturalisation. [[Agricultural policy]] may make exemptions for migrant farm workers, who typically enter a country only for the harvest season and then return home to a country or region in the [[Global South]] (such as Mexico or Jamaica from where America and Canada, respectively, often import temporary agricultural labour).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nardep.info/uploads/Brief_FarmWorker.pdf |title=Immigration and Farm Labor in the U.S. |publisher=National Agriculture and Rural Development Policy Center |date=May 4, 2013 |accessdate=2015-07-28}}</ref> An important aspect of immigration policy is the treatment of [[refugee]]s, more or less helpless or stateless people who throw themselves on the mercy of the state they try to enter, seeking refuge from actual or purported poor treatment in their country of origin. Asylum is sometimes granted to those who face persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion.\n\n====Special areas in Europe====\n[[Immigration]] policies in special areas in Europe can range from severely limiting migration, as in Greece's [[Mount Athos]], to allowing most types of migration, such as the [[free migration]]{{efn|Uniquely, the archipelago is an [[Visa policy of Svalbard|entirely visa-free zone]] under the terms of the Svalbard Treaty,<ref>[http://www.aljazeera.com/archive/2006/07/200841012024779644.html Immigrants warmly welcomed], [[Al Jazeera]], 4 July 2006.</ref> which recognises the sovereignty of Norway over the Arctic archipelago of [[Svalbard]] but subjects it to certain stipulations and consequently not all Norwegian law applies, including border controls.

Similar policies are in force for Iran's [[Kish Island|Kish]] and [[Qeshm Island|Qeshm]], {{IPA-fa|\u0262e\u0283m}}) islands, and for Iraqi Kurdistan.\n\n====Diaspora communities====\n[[File:OCI JK.jpg|thumb|140px|An OCI booklet exempting its bearer from usual immigration controls in India.]] [[File:Karta Polaka wz\u00f3r.jpg|thumb|120px|left|''Karta Polaka'' \u2013 specimen document]]\n\nCertain countries adopt immigration policies designed to be favourable towards members of diaspora communities with a connection to the country. For example, the Indian government confers Overseas Citizenship of India (OCI) status on foreign citizens of [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indian origin]] to live and work indefinitely in India. OCI status was introduced in response to demands for [[Multiple citizenship|dual citizenship]] by the Indian diaspora, particularly in countries with large populations of Indian origin. It was introduced by ''The Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2005'' in August 2005.<ref>[http://mha.nic.in/uniquepage.asp?Id_Pk=553 Overseas Citizenship of India (OCI); Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090926231018/http://mha.nic.in/uniquepage.asp?Id_Pk=553 |date=2009-09-26 }}, [http://www.moia.gov.in/services.aspx?id1=35&id=m3&idp=35&mainid=23 Diaspora Services: Overseas Citizenship of India Scheme] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504131659/http://moia.gov.in/services.aspx?id1=35&id=m3&idp=35&mainid=23 |date=2012-05-04 }}</ref> In the [[ASEAN]] region, a large portion of the Singaporean, Malaysian, and Bruneian population hold OCI status. Large OCI communities also exist in North America, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand, as well as in many African nations (particularly South Africa, Madagascar, and members of the [[East African Community]]). OCI status exempts holders from immigration controls generally imposed upon others of the same nationality.\n\nSimilarly, Poland issues the [[Karta Polaka]] to citizens of certain northeast European countries with Polish ancestry.\n\nA British Ancestry visa is a document issued by the United Kingdom to [[Commonwealth citizen]]s with a grandparent born in the United Kingdom, [[Channel Islands]] or [[Isle of Man]] who wish to work in the United Kingdom. Similar to OCI status, it exempts members of the country\u2019s diaspora from usual immigration controls. It is used mainly by young Australians, New Zealanders, Canadians and South Africans of [[British diaspora|British descent]] coming to UK to work and as a base to explore Europe.<ref name=tele>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2008/02/21/nvisa121.xml |title=Britain may abolish ancestry visa |location=London |work=The Daily Telegraph |first=Philip |last=Johnston |date=21 February 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080326202004/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fnews%2F2008%2F02%2F21%2Fnvisa121.xml |archivedate=March 26, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nSome nations recognise a [[right of return]] for people with ancestry in that country. A notable example of this is the right of [[Sephardi Jews]] to acquire Spanish nationality by virtue of their community\u2019s Spanish origins. Similar exemptions to immigration controls exist for people of Armenian origin seeking to acquire Armenian citizenship. Ghana, similarly, grants an indefinite right to stay in Ghana to members of the [[African diaspora]] regardless of citizenship.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theafricareport.com/West-Africa/ghana-a-place-for-african-americans-to-resettle.html |title=Ghana, a place for African Americans to resettle |last=Dovi |first=Efam |date=11 May 2015 |website=The Africa Report|publisher= |access-date=15 August 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n\n===International zones===\nAn international zone is a type of [[extraterritoriality|extraterritorial]] area not fully subject to any country\u2019s border control policies. The term most commonly refers to the areas of [[international airports]] after border exit controls or before border  entry controls. These areas often contain duty-free shopping, but they are not fully extraterritorial. It is usually possible to transfer between flights without needing either the  passport check or visa otherwise needed to enter the country. In areas of conflict there may be international zones called green zones that form protective enclaves to keep diplomats safe. Countries in conflict may also have international zones separating each other. Some of the international zones are subject to [[international law]].\n\n====Airport transit areas====\nThe international zone in an [[international airport]] is the area where arriving international passengers have not formally entered the country by clearing arrival customs and immigration controls, and departing passengers have formally exited the country by clearing exit immigration control. Transit passengers can take connecting international flights in the international zone without clearing customs and immigration controls, and in most cases do not require a [[travel visa|visa]].<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |title=Former Colleague Aided U.S. In Trapping Ex-C.I.A.

All passengers arriving on international flights are subject to customs and immigration inspections. Hence, transiting at a U.S. airport require at least a [[C-1 visa|C-1 transit visa]], or a [[Electronic System for Travel Authorization|travel authorisation]] for [[Visa Waiver Program]] (VWP) travellers.\n\nA common feature of the international zone is [[duty-free]] shopping for departing and transit passengers, and in some cases arriving passengers subject to duty-free allowances.\n\nInternational zones in airports are fully under the jurisdiction of the country where they are located and local laws apply. Persons caught committing an unlawful act (e.g. possession of contraband such as illegal drugs) in the international zone are liable for prosecution.\n\n==== Other examples====\n[[File:UNflags.jpg|thumb|upright=1|Flags of United Nations member states flying outside the United Nations Headquarters complex in New York City.]]\n* The [[United Nations Headquarters|United Nations' Headquarters]] are a series of complexes in New York City (United States), [[United Nations Office at Geneva|Geneva]] (Switzerland), [[United Nations Office at Vienna|Vienna]] (Austria), and [[United Nations Office at Nairobi|Nairobi]] (Kenya)<ref name=\"vienna\">{{cite web| title=Welcome to the United Nations Office at Vienna!| url=http://www.unov.org/unov/index.html| publisher=United Nations| accessdate=24 October 2011}}</ref> that exist on international territory.

Each concession had its own police force, and different legal jurisdictions with their own separate laws. Thus, an activity might be legal in one concession but illegal in another. Many of the concessions also maintained their own military garrison and standing army. Military and police forces of the Chinese government were sometimes present. Some police forces allowed Chinese, others did not. In these concessions, the citizens of each foreign power were given the right to freely inhabit, trade, [[missionary|spread religious propaganda]], and travel. They developed their own sub-cultures, isolated and distinct from the intrinsic [[Chinese culture]], and colonial administrations attempted to give their concessions \"homeland\" qualities. Churches, [[public house]]s, and various other western commercial institutions sprang up in the concessions. In the case of Japan, its own traditions and language naturally flourished. Some of these concessions eventually had more advanced architecture of each originating culture than most cities back in the countries of the foreign powers origin. Chinese were originally forbidden from most of the concessions, but to improve commercial activity and services, by the 1860s most concessions permitted Chinese, but treated them like second-class citizens as they were not citizens of the foreign state administering the concession.  They eventually became the majority of the residents inside the concessions. Non-Chinese in the concessions were generally subject to [[Consul (representative)|consular]] law, and some of these laws applied to the Chinese residents. Notable Concessions include the [[Shanghai International Settlement]] administered by the United Kingdom and America, the [[Shanghai French Concession|French Concession in Shanghai]] , the [[Kwantung Leased Territory]], and the [[Beijing Legation Quarter]].\n* Iraq has an international zone around the Republican Palace in central [[Baghdad]] in a crook of the Tigris River.

The West Berlin section of the station featured an East German government-run [[Intershop]], which sold duty-free and high-quality items at lower prices compared to the West.

This was never implemented; the city was the scene of fierce fighting in 1948 which culminated in its partition between Israel and Jordan. Nineteen years later in 1967 the Jordanian-occupied part was captured and unilaterally annexed by Israel. However, the idea of an international zone in Jerusalem, encompassing at least the highly sensitive [[Old City of Jerusalem]] , continues to be floated by various would-be mediators. Whilst it is often asserted that the [[World Zionist Organization|Zionist community]] favoured this plan, scholars such as [[Simha Flapan]] have determined that it is a myth that Zionists accepted the partition as a compromise by which the Jewish community abandoned ambitions for the whole of Palestine and recognised the rights of the Arab Palestinians to their own state. Rather, Flapan argued, acceptance was only a tactical move that aimed to thwart the creation of an Arab Palestinian state and, concomitantly, expand the territory that had been assigned by the UN to the Jewish state.<ref>Simha Flapan (1988).

It contained houses for about twenty Dutchmen, warehouses, and accommodation for Japanese officials. The Dutch were watched by a number of Japanese officials, gatekeepers, night watchmen, and a supervisor with about fifty subordinates. Numerous merchants supplied goods and catering, and about 150 interpreters served. They all had to be paid by the Dutch East India Company. For two hundred years, foreign merchants were generally not allowed to cross from Dejima to Nagasaki.  The Japanese were likewise banned from entering Dejima, except interpreters, cooks, carpenters, clerks and 'Women of Pleasure' from the Maruyama teahouses. These ''[[Prostitution in Japan|y\u016bjo]]'' were handpicked from 1642 by the Japanese, often against their will. From the 18th century, there were some exceptions to this rule, especially following the policy of promoting European practical sciences implemented by [[Tokugawa Yoshimune]]. A limited number of Japanese were allowed to stay for longer periods, but they had to report regularly to the Japanese guard post. Once a year the Europeans were allowed to attend the festivities at the Suwa-Shrine under escort. Sometimes physicians such as [[Engelbert Kaempfer]], [[Carl Peter Thunberg]], and [[Philipp Franz von Siebold]] were called to high-ranking Japanese patients with the permission of the authorities.<ref>''In the context of Commodore Perry's \"opening\" of Japan in 1853, American naval expedition planners incorporated reference material written by men whose published accounts of Japan were based on first-hand experience.

Italy fought with the [[Axis powers]] during the war, and when the Fascist regime collapsed in 1943 and Italy capitulated, the territory was occupied by [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Wehrmacht|forces]] who created the [[Operational Zone of the Adriatic Littoral]], the capital of which was Trieste.

The [[2nd Division (New Zealand)]] arrived on the next day and forced the surrender of the 2,000 [[Wehrmacht|German Army]] troops holding out in Trieste, who warily had refused to capitulate to partisan troops, fearing they would be executed by them. An uneasy truce developed between New Zealand and Yugoslav troops occupying the area until British Gen. [[William Duthie Morgan|Sir William Morgan]] proposed a partition of the territory and the removal of Yugoslav troops from the area occupied by the Allies. Yugoslav leader [[Josip Broz Tito]] agreed in principle on 23 May, as the British XIII Corps was moving forward to the proposed demarcation line.

In some countries, controls may be targeted at the traveller's religion, ethnicity, nationality, or other countries that have been visited. Others may need to be certain the traveller has paid the appropriate fees for their [[visa (document)|visas]] and has future travel planned out of the country. Yet others may concentrate on the contents of the traveler's baggage, and imported goods to ensure nothing is being carried that might bring a [[biosecurity]] risk into the country.\n\n===Border vistas===\n\n[[File:Border vista.jpg|thumb|upright|The vista along the [[Canada\u2013United States border]], as seen from a [[Rest area|wayside]] on the [[Alaska Highway]].]]\nA border vista or boundary vista is a defined cleared space between two areas of foliage located at an international border intended to provide a clear demarcation line between the two areas. Border vistas are most commonly found along undefended international boundary lines, where border security is not as much of a necessity and a built barrier is undesired, and are a treaty requirement for certain borders.\n\nAn example of a border vista is a six-metre cleared space around unguarded portions of the [[Canada\u2013United States border]].<ref>[[Stacy Schiff|Schiff, Stacy]]. [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/22/opinion/22schiff.html \"Politics Starts at the Border\"], ''The New York Times''. 22 July 2007. Accessed 3 August 2018.</ref>\n\nSimilar clearings along the border line are provided for by many international treaties. For example, the 2006 border management treaty [[China\u2013Russia border|between Russia and China]] provides for a {{convert|15|m|ft|adj=mid|-wide}} cleared strip along the two nations' border.<ref>[http://www.rosgranitsa.ru/ru/node/3140 Agreement between the Government of the Russian Federation and the Government of the People's Republic of China on the management of the Russia-China international border] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150709062825/http://www.rosgranitsa.ru/ru/node/3140 |date=2015-07-09 }}, rosgranitsa.ru</ref>\n\n===Travel documents===\n{{see also|Travel document|Passport}}\n\nDifferent countries impose varying travel document regulations and requirements as part of their border control policies and these may vary based on the traveller's mode of transport. For instance, whilst America does not subject passengers departing by land or most boats to any border control, it does require that passengers departing by air hold a valid passport (or certain specific passport-replacing documents). Even though travellers might not require a passport to enter a certain country, they ''will'' require a valid passport booklet (booklet only, U.S. Passport Card not accepted) to depart the United States in order to satisfy the U.S. immigration authorities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.iata.org/publications/timatic/Documents/using_timatic_v3.pdf|title=Page 7 of IATA document accessed 5 December 2015 at|publisher=}}</ref>\n[[File:Aeroport de dubai terminal 3 egate (echecking of passport).jpg|thumb|Passport control at [[Dubai Airport]]]]\nCanada requires any Canadian Permanent Residents entering the country by air to use their [[Canada permanent resident card|Permanent Resident Card]] or a special document authorising their return.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=1050&top=16|title=I am a permanent resident of Canada.

As a consequence of awkward border situations created by the fall of the Soviet Union, certain former members of the USSR and their neighbours require few or no travel documents for travellers transiting across international boundaries between two points in a single country. For instance, Russia permits vehicles to transit across the [[Saatse Boot]] between the Estonian villages of [[Lutep\u00e4\u00e4]] and [[Sesniki]] without any border control provided that they do not stop. Similar provisions are made for the issuance of Facilitated Rail Transit Documents by Schengen Area members for travel between Kaliningrad and the Russian mainland.\n\n====Indian Identity Certificate====\nThe Indian government issues Identity Certificates to members of the large Tibetan exile community. Identity Certificates are generally issued upon request of the Dalai Lama\u2019s Tibetan government in exile based in Dharamsala in northern India. This document is accepted as per most countries border control policies in lieu of a passport, although it is not a machine readable document. When issued to a Tibetan residing in India, it is invariably endorsed as being valid for return to India and therefore exempts the holder from requiring a visa to clear Indian border controls upon re-entry.\n\n====Non-citizen residents====\n[[File:United States Travel Document Cover Page.jpg|thumb|120px|The American re-entry permit is a travel document for permanent residents issued on request.]] [[File:2017-us-green-card-specimen.png|thumb|120px|American Green Card issued to all permanent residents.]] [[File:Japan Re-entry Permit 2012.png|thumb|left|120px|Japan re-entry permit issued to Japanese North Koreans and other stateless permanent residents of Japan]]\n\nSome countries issue travel documents to permanent residents (i.e. foreign citizens permitted to reside there indefinitely) or other non-citizens, usually for re-entry but also occasionally valid for international travel.\n\nThe American [[U.S. Re-entry Permit|re-entry permit]] is an example of such a document. Valid for international travel, it is issued to lawful permanent residents temporarily expatriating overseas. Unlike the [[Permanent residence (United States)|\u201dGreen Card\u201d]] issued to all permanent residents, this document is not mandatory. The American \u201cGreen Card\u201d, on its own or in conjunction with a passport, is valid for international travel albeit not to the same extent as the re-entry permit. Both documents can be utilised to clear American border controls regardless of the bearers nationality, thus resulting in America not requiring permanent residents to hold a passport from their home country in order to remain lawfully present or to lawfully enter.\n\nSingapore issues [[National Registration Identity Card|national identity cards]] to permanent residents in the same manner as it does to citizens, but additionally requires any permanent resident travelling abroad to hold a valid electronic re-entry permit and a passport or other travel document from their home country.

They also issue the [[Hong Kong Document of Identity for Visa Purposes]] and [[Macao Special Administrative Region Travel Permit|Macau Travel Permit]], respectively, to stateless permanent residents and to Chinese citizens temporarily residing in the region holding neither permanent residence of Hong Kong or Macau nor residence status in the mainland.\n\nSimilarly, [[Ch\u014dsen-seki|Japanese North Koreans]] are issued a Japan Re-entry Permit for international travel.\n\n====National identity cards and birth certificates====\n{{multiple image\n| width = 160\n| image1=DNIArg-anv-wikipedia.jpg |\n| image2=DNIArg-rev-wikipedia.jpg |\n| footer = Argentinian [[Documento Nacional de Identidad (Argentina)|National ID card]] valid for travel to other [[Mercosur]] countries in lieu of a passport\n}}\n\nCertain jurisdictions permit the use of national identity cards to clear border controls. For instance, when travelling between India and Nepal or Bhutan, Indian citizens may utilise national voter ID cards, ration cards, or [[Aadhar|national identity cards]]. Indian citizens may also obtain identity slips at the Indian consulate in Phuentsholing if they intend to proceed beyond city limits as Phuentsholing, the financial capital of Bhutan, is de facto within India\u2019s visa and customs area. When travelling to India, citizens of Nepal and Bhutan can utilise similar documents. Children may use birth certificates as proof of identity.\n\nIn North America, American citizens may travel using [[United States Passport Card|passport cards]], a form of voluntary identity card issued to American citizens. Children holding American or Canadian citizenship may travel to and from Canada using birth certificates under certain circumstances. In South America, many [[Mercosur]] countries reciprocally permit travel using identity cards.\n\nIn western Europe, travel using identity cards is relatively common for citizens of the European Economic Area and adjacent territories. This includes travel to and from Turkey for certain citizens of other countries in western Europe. Within the Schengen Area, there are limited border controls in place and national identity cards may be used to clear them.\n\n====Chinese Travel Document====\n[[File:TD PRC.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Chinese Travel Document]]\nThe Chinese Government requires certain people to enter the mainland using a [[Chinese Travel Document]]. Some cases include:\n* When it is \"inconvenient\", \"unnecessary\", or not permitted to issue a [[People's Republic of China passport]] to Chinese nationals.<ref>[http://www.gov.cn/banshi/2005-06/01/content_3133.htm What's the difference between a Travel Document and a Passport?] {{in lang|zh}} Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China.</ref>\n* Chinese nationals residing in [[Mainland China]] who lost their passport while travelling abroad may apply for this document as an emergency passport for returning to China.\n* Chinese nationals who are permanent residents of Hong Kong and [[Macau]] intending to enter Mainland China directly from other countries without a [[Home Return Permit]].\n* Residents of the Taiwan area{{efn|name=ROC}} intending to enter Mainland China or Hong Kong directly from other countries, who are Chinese nationals according to Chinese law. Travelling to Hong Kong, however, requires a separate application for a visa-like entry permit.\n* Chinese nationals born abroad who acquired Chinese nationality at birth in accordance with the [[Nationality Law of the People's Republic of China]] through ''[[jus sanguinis]]''. The Chinese Travel Document is issued as a Chinese identification and travel document.\n* Chinese nationals born in China who do not have a Hukou in China and who have exited China using an exit permit. This could include a person who holds a non-Chinese passport.\n\n====Enhanced Driving Licence====\nAn [[Enhanced Drivers License|Enhanced Driving Licence]] is a document issued by provincial and state authorities in Canada and America that enables its bearer to clear border controls along the border between the two countries. It is not valid for air travel and does not permit its holder to clear border controls at airports. It also serves as a valid driving licence. Certain provinces and states may issue similar enhanced versions of regional identity cards issued to individuals who do not drive.\n\n====Quilantan entry====\nA \u2018Quilantan\u2019 or \u2018Wave Through\u2019 Entry is a phenomenon in American border control law authorising a form of non-standard but legal entry without any inspection of travel documents. It occurs when the border security personnel present at a border crossing choose to summarily admit some number of persons without performing a standard interview or document examination.<ref>{{cite court |litigants=Matter of Graciela QUILANTAN, Respondent |reporter=A095 426 631 |court=Board of Immigration Appeals |date=2010-07-28 |url=https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/eoir/legacy/2014/07/25/3688.pdf }}</ref>\n\nTypically this can occur when an official border crossing is busy and an immigration officer waves a car through without first checking all passengers for their travel documents. If an individual can prove that they were waved into the United States in this manner, then they are considered to have entered with inspection despite not having answered any questions or received a passport [[Passport stamp|entry stamp]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=Matter of Quilantan helps immigrant |journal=Lexis/Nexis |date=2012-01-17 |last=Kowalski |first=Daniel M. |url=https://www.lexisnexis.com/legalnewsroom/immigration/b/insidenews/archive/2012/01/17/matter-of-quilantan-helps-immigrant.aspx?Redirected=true |accessdate=2017-12-07 |quote=Because she wasn't trying to sneak across and hadn't been questioned by the immigration officer who waved them into Texas, the court found she had been \"inspected and admitted\" legally. }}</ref>\n\nThis definition of legal entry does not apply to situations where foreigners entered the United States but have not crossed at a legal, manned border station. Thus it does not provide a path to legal residency for those who have entered into the United State by crossing accidental gaps in the borders around geological formations.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Matter of Quilantan helps immigrant |journal=Lexis/Nexis |date=2012-01-17 |last=Kowalski |first=Daniel M. |url=https://www.lexisnexis.com/legalnewsroom/immigration/b/insidenews/archive/2012/01/17/matter-of-quilantan-helps-immigrant.aspx?Redirected=true |accessdate=2017-12-07 |quote=The case doesn't apply to millions of undocumented immigrants who crossed rivers, mountains and deserts, evading U.S. immigration officials. }}</ref>\n\n====Border areas====\n[[File:Border Crossing Card.jpg|thumb|right|The front of the updated version of the American Border Crossing Card issued to Mexican nationals]]\nIn certain cases, countries adopt border control policies imposing reduced border controls for frequent travellers intending to remain within a [[border area]]. For example, the relaxed border controls maintained by Bhutan for those not proceeding past Phuentsholing and certain other border cities enable travellers to enter without going through any document check whatsoever. The American [[Border Crossing Card]] issued to Mexican nationals enables Mexicans to enter border areas without a passport.{{efn|As a standalone document, the BCC allows Mexican citizens to visit border areas in America when entering by land or sea directly from Mexico for less than 72 hours.<ref>[https://mx.usembassy.gov/visas/domestic-employees/frequently-asked-questions/?_ga=1.54366443.213467364.1464033918 Frequently Asked Questions]</ref> The document also functions as a full B1/B2 visa when presented with a valid Mexican passport.<ref name=\"BCC1\">[https://help.cbp.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/1635/~/border-crossing-card---who-can-use-it%3F Border Crossing Card \u2013 Who can use it?]</ref>}} Both America and Bhutan maintain [[Border control#Internal borders|interior checkposts]] to enforce compliance.\n\nSimilarly, Schengen states which share an external land border with a non-EU member state are authorised by virtue of the EU Regulation 1931/2006 to conclude or maintain bilateral agreements with neighbouring third countries for the purpose of implementing a [[local border traffic]] regime.<ref>Corrigendum to Regulation (EC) No 1931/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 December 2006 laying down rules on local border traffic at the external land borders of the Member States and amending the provisions of the Schengen Convention ([http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32006R1931R%2801%29:EN:NOT OJ L 29, 3 February 2007, p. 3]).</ref> Such agreements define a [[border area]] on either side of the border, and provide for the issuance of local border traffic permits to residents of the border area. Permits may be used to cross the EU external border within the border area, are not stamped on crossing the border and must display the holder's name and photograph, as well as a statement that its holder is not authorised to move outside the border area and that any abuse shall be subject to penalties.\n\n===Agricultural restrictions===\n\nIn certain countries, border control focuses extensively on curtailing and regulating the import of foreign agricultural products. For example, Australian border controls restrict most (if not all) food products, certain wooden products and other similar items.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.agriculture.gov.au/travelling/arriving-in-australia |title = Department of Agriculture Fact sheet - Travelling or returning to Australia}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://newzealand.embassy.gov.au/wltn/customsfaq.html |title = Australian High Commission in}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/busi/cargo-support-trade-and-goods/importing-goods/prohibited-and-restricted |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-08-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180907224853/https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/busi/cargo-support-trade-and-goods/importing-goods/prohibited-and-restricted |archive-date=2018-09-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Similar restrictions exist in Canada, America and New Zealand.\n\n===Drugs===\n[[File:SingaporeEmbarkationCard.png|thumb|160px|Singapore arrival card warning visitors about the [[Capital punishment for drug trafficking|death penalty for drug trafficking]].]]\nBorder controls in many countries in the Greater India region prioritise mitigating trade in narcotics. For instance, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia impose mandatory death sentences on individuals caught smuggling restricted substances across their borders. For example, Muhammad Ridzuan Ali was executed in Singapore on 19 May 2017 for drug trafficking.<ref>{{cite news|title=Singaporean drug trafficker executed at Changi Prison for heroin offence|url=http://str.sg/4u3w|accessdate=21 August 2018|work=The Straits Times|date=19 May 2017|language=en}}</ref> India and Malaysia are focusing resources on eliminating drug smuggling from Myanmar and Thailand respectively. The issue stems largely from the high output of dangerous and illegal drugs in the [[Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia)|Golden Triangle]] as well as in regions further west such as Afghanistan.\n\nA similar problem exists east of the Pacific, and has resulted in countries such as Mexico and America tightening border control in response to the northward flow of illegal substances from regions such as Colombia. The [[Mexican Drug War]] and similar cartel activity in neighbouring areas has exacerbated the problem.\n\n===Visas===\n[[File:Indian Tourist Visa 2016 stamped.jpg|150px|thumb|Example of a tourist visa placed directly inside the travel document of a stateless individual.]] [[File:Singapore visa issued to stateless person.jpg|thumb|135px|left|Multiple entry visa issued to a [[statelessness|stateless]] person, whose lack of nationality is indicated with the code XXA]] [[File:Malaysia ENTRI.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Sample of printed out eNTRI slip for Indian and mainland Chinese citizens to clear Malaysian border controls without a visa.]]\n[[File:Thai Visa on Arrival.jpg|105px|thumb|left|Visa issued on arrival in Thailand]]\n\nMost countries impose visa requirements on foreign nationals, and depending on the country's border control strategy these can be liberal or restrictive.\n\nMany countries in the Greater India region have liberalised their visa controls in recent years to encourage transnational business and tourism. For example, [[Visa policy of India|India]], [[Visa policy of Myanmar|Myanmar]], and [[Visa policy of Sri Lanka|Sri Lanka]] have introduced electronic visas to make border control less of a bureaucratic hurdle for business travellers and tourists. [[Visa policy of Malaysia|Malaysia]] has introduced similar eVisa facilities, and has also introduced the eNTRI programme to expedite clearance for Indian citizens and Chinese citizens from the mainland. [[Visa policy of Thailand|Thailand regularly issues]] visas on arrival to many non-exempt visitors at major ports of entry in order to encourage tourism. Indonesia, in recent years, has progressively liberalised [[Visa policy of Indonesia|its visa regime]], no longer requiring visas or on-arrival visas from most nationals, while [[Visa policy of Singapore|Singapore]] has signed visa waiver agreements with many countries in recent years and has introduced electronic visa facilities for Indians, Eastern Europeans, and mainland Chinese. This trend towards visa liberalisation in the Greater India region is part of the broader phenomenon of [[globalisation]] and has been linked to heightened economic growth.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/south-east-asia-can-benefit-greatly-from-globalisation-if-countries-work-together-ong|title=Asia can benefit greatly from globalisation if countries work together: Ong Ye Kung|date=4 June 2017|accessdate=20 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nCertain countries, predominantly but not exclusively in western Europe and the Americas, issue [[working holiday visa]]s for younger visitors to supplement their travel funds by working minor jobs. These are especially common in members of the European Union such as Austria, and elsewhere in western Europe such as Switzerland and Ukraine.\n\nSaudi Arabia issues a [[Visa policy of Saudi Arabia#Hajj visas|special category visa]] for people on religious pilgrimage. Similar policies are in force in other countries with significant religious sites.\n\nCertain jurisdictions impose special visa requirements on [[journalism|journalists]] in order to curtail the freedom of foreign reporters and news organisations to report on controversial topics. Countries that impose such visas include Cuba, [[Visa policy of China|China]], North Korea, Saudi Arabia, [[Visa policy of the United States#I visa|America]] and Zimbabwe.\n\n====Substitute visas====\nMany countries let individuals clear border controls using foreign visas.

Such travellers still may not enter Canada by land or sea without a valid Canadian visa.\n\n===Exit controls===\n{{multiple image\n| footer    = India and China, like most countries, implement border controls at both entry and exit, and consequently stamp passports upon exit\n| width     = 100\n| image1    = India passport entry stamp.jpg\n| alt1      = Indian entry stamp at New Deli [[Indira Gandhi International Airport]].\n| image2    = India passport stamp.jpg\n| alt2      = Indian exit stamp at Indira Gandhi International Airport.\n| image3    = China Visa Stamp.jpg\n| alt3      = Chinese entry and exit stamps at [[Shanghai Pudong International Airport]].\n}}\n[[File:Queenston Bridge Canada Passport Bridge.JPG|thumb|130px|Entry stamp at [[Lewiston\u2013Queenston Bridge]], Ontario. Canada only conducts border control and stamps passports upon entry.]]\n\nWhilst most countries implement border controls both at entry and at exit, some jurisdictions do not. For instance, USA and Canada do not implement exit controls at land borders and collect exit data on foreign nationals through airlines and through information sharing with neighbouring countries\u2019 entry border controls. These countries consequently don't issue exit stamps even to travellers who require stamps on entry. Similarly, Australia, Singapore and South Korea have eliminated exit stamps even though they continue to implement brief border control checks upon exit for most foreign nationals.\n\n====Exit visas====\nSome countries in Europe maintain controversial exit visa systems in addition to regular border controls. For instance, Uzbekistan requires its own citizens to obtain exit visas prior to leaving for countries other than [[Commonwealth of Independent States|fellow CIS]] nations in eastern Europe. Several [[Gulf Cooperation Council|countries in the Arabian peninsula]] require exit visas for foreign workers under the [[Kafala System]] meaning \"sponsorship system\"). Russia occasionally requires foreigners who overstay to obtain [[Visa policy of Russia#Exit|exit visas]] since one cannot exit Russia without a valid visa. Czechia has a similar policy.<ref>[http://www.sagit.cz/_texty/sb99326.htm Act on the status of aliens in Czech Republic], \u00a720</ref>  Similarly, a foreign citizen granted a temporary residence permit in Russia needs an exit visa to take a trip abroad (valid for both exit and return). Not all foreign citizens are subject to that requirement. Citizens of Germany, for example, do not require this exit visa.\n\nCertain Asian countries have policies that similarly require certain categories of citizens to seek official authorisation prior to travelling or emigrating. This is usually either as a way to enforce [[conscription|national service]] obligations or to protect migrant workers from travelling to places where they may be abused by employers. Singapore, for instance, operates an Exit Permit scheme in order to enforce the [[National service in Singapore|national service]] obligations of its male citizens and permanent residents.<ref>{{cite act |title= Enlistment Act|type= |number= 25|language= |date= 1970|article= 32|articletype= s.|page= |url= http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/aol/search/display/view.w3p;orderBy=date-rev,loadTime;page=0;query=DocId%3A%227c7b1aab-8403-4443-b322-0cba08be5d45%22%20Status%3Ainforce%20Depth%3A0%20ValidTime%3A20161111000000%20TransactionTime%3A20161111000000;rec=0}}</ref> These restrictions vary according to age and status.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.ecitizen.gov.sg/Topics/Pages/National-Service-Exit-permit-requirements.aspx|title= National Service: Exit permit requirements|author= <!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|date= |website= ecitizen.gov.sg|access-date= 2018-08-08|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170108045359/http://www.ecitizen.gov.sg/Topics/Pages/National-Service-Exit-permit-requirements.aspx|archive-date= 2017-01-08|url-status= dead}}</ref> [[South Korea]] and [[Taiwan]] <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ris.gov.tw/departure/app/|title=\u5167\u653f\u90e8\u5f79\u653f\u7f72\u5f79\u7537\u7dda\u4e0a\u7533\u8acb\u77ed\u671f\u51fa\u5883|website=www.ris.gov.tw}}</ref> have similar policies. [[India]], on the other hand, requires citizens who have not met certain educational requirements (and thus may be targeted by human traffickers or be coerced into [[modern slavery]]) to apply for approval prior to leaving the country and endorses their passports with [[Emigration Act, 1983|\u201dEmigration Check Required\u201d]]. [[Nepal]] similarly requires citizens emigrating to [[the United States]] on an [[H-1B visa]] to present an exit permit issued by the Ministry of Labour. This document is called a work permit and needs to be presented to immigration to leave the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dol.gov.np/|title=Department of Labour \u2013 Government Of Nepal|publisher=}}</ref> In a bid to increase protection for the large amount of Indian, Bangladeshi, Chinese, and Nepali citizens smuggled through Indian airports to the [[Middle East]] as underpaid labourers, many Indian airline companies require travellers to obtain an \u2018OK to Board\u2019 confirmation sent directly from visa authorities in certain GCC countries directly to the airline and will bar anyone who has not obtained this endorsement from clearing exit immigration.\n\n===Nationality and travel history===\n[[File:Visa requirements for Taiwanese citizens (6).png|thumb|upright=3|center|Map illustrating extra border controls placed on [[National without household registration|Taiwan passport holders without household registration in Taiwan]].]]\nMany nations implement border controls restricting the entry of people of certain nationalities or who have visited certain countries.

ROC nationals without ID numbers do not, for instance, have access to the American [[Visa Waiver Program]]me, or to visa free access to the Schengen Area or Japan. Other countries, such as India which allows all Chinese nationals to apply for [[Visa policy of India|eVisas]], don't make such a distinction. Singapore imposes [[Visa policy of Singapore#Assessment Level II Countries|strict controls]] on stateless individuals and refugees, and reduces length of stay for British nationals without right of abode in the United Kingdom, but does not distinguish between ROC passports with and without national ID numbers.\n\nAs a result of tension over the [[Republic of Artsakh|Artsakh]] dispute, Azerbaijan currently forbids entry to Armenian citizens as well as to individuals with proof of travel to Artsakh.\n\n==Free travel areas==\nCertain neighbouring countries may agree to fully or partially abolish border controls between them.\n\n===Central America-4 Border Control Agreement===\n{{main|Central America-4 Border Control Agreement}}\nThe Central America-4 Border Control Agreement abolishes border controls for land travel between El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Guatemala. However, this does not apply to air travel.\n\n===Commonwealth of Independent States===\n{{main|Commonwealth of Independent States}}\n\nThe Commonwealth of Independent States, or CIS, is an organisation composed of former members of the Soviet Union, whose members eliminate many trade and visa related border controls.\n\n====Union State of Russia and Belarus====\n{{main|Union State of Russia and Belarus}}\n\nThe Union State of Russia and Belarus is a supranational union of Russia and Belarus (two CIS members), which eliminates all border controls between the two nations. However, each country continues to maintain its own visa policies, thus resulting in non-citizens of the two countries generally being barred from travelling directly between the two.\n\n===Western Europe===\n\n{{main|Schengen Area|Common Travel Area}}\nThe two most significant free travel areas in Western Europe are the Schengen area, in which very little if any border control is generally visible, and the Common Travel Area (CTA), which partially eliminates such controls for nationals of the United Kingdom and Ireland. Between countries in the [[Schengen Area]], and to an extent within the CTA on the British Isles, internal border control is often virtually unnoticeable, and often only performed by means of random car or train searches in the [[hinterland]], while controls at borders with non-member states may be rather strict.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:The Border on Killeen School Road - geograph.org.uk - 446719.jpg|Irish border at Killeen (within CTA) marked only by a metric speed sign, as the Republic of Ireland uses the metric system whilst British road signs use imperial units\nFile:Northern Ireland border crossing sign 60mph.JPG|Sign often found at crossings from the Republic of Ireland into the North.\nImage:Grenzuebergang D-NL Elmpt-Grenze.JL.jpg|Open Schengen Area border crossing between Germany and the Netherlands\nFile:Panoramio - V&A Dudush - Avenue Princesse Grace (1).jpg|Open Schengen Area border crossing at the France-Monaco border\nFile:\u0412\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438 \u041a\u043d\u044f\u0436\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u041b\u0438\u0445\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0448\u0442\u0435\u0439\u043d - panoramio.jpg|Open Schengen Area border crossing at the Swiss-Lichtenstein border\n</gallery>\n\n===Greater India===\n[[File:Visa policy of Bhutan.png|400px|thumb|Visa policy of Bhutan, showing free movement arrangement between India and Bhutan]]\n{{main|1950 Indo-Nepal Treaty of Peace and Friendship|Visa policy of Bhutan}}\n\nIndia and Nepal maintain a similar arrangement to the CTA and the Union State of Russia and Belarus. Indians and Nepalis aren't subject to any migration controls in each other\u2019s countries and there are few controls on land travel by citizens across the border.\n\nIndia and Bhutan also have a similar system. The border between Jaigaon, in the Indian state of West Bengal, and the city of Phuentsholing is essentially open, and although there are internal checkpoints, Indians are allowed to proceed throughout Bhutan with a voter\u2019s ID or an identity slip from the Indian consulate in Phuentsholing. Similarly, Bhutanese passport holders enjoy free movement in India.\n\nWhilst not as liberal as the policies concerning the Indo-Nepalese and Indo-Bhutanese borders, Thailand and Cambodia have begun issuing combined visas to certain categories of tourists applying at specific Thai or Cambodian embassies and consulates in order to enable freer border crossings between the two countries.<ref>[http://www.nationmultimedia.com/national/Single-entry-visa-for-Thailand-Cambodia-30196863.html]</ref> The policy is currently in force for nationals of America and several European (primarily EU and GCC) and Oceanian countries as well as for Indian and Chinese nationals residing in Singapore.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.thaiembassy.sg/announcements/acmecs-single-visa-application-now-opens-for-citizen-of-35-countries-wishing-to-enter-0 |title = ACMECS Single Visa application now opens for citizen of 35 countries wishing to enter Thailand and Cambodia for tourism purposes &#124; Royal Thai Embassy}}</ref>\n\n===Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement===\n[[File:New Zealand Resident Visa Stamp on Australian Travel Document.jpg|130px|thumbnail|A New Zealand visa stamp issued under Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement on an Australian travel document.]]\nThe [[Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement]] is not a free travel area. However, citizens and Australian permanent residents receive free indefinite visas with work rights at immigration control points in airports and sea ports.\n\nThe arrangement came into effect in 1973, and allows citizens of each country to reside and work in the other country, with some restrictions. Other details of the arrangement have varied over time. From 1 July 1981, all people entering Australia (including New Zealand citizens) have been required to carry a passport. Since 1 September 1994 Australia has had a universal visa requirement, and to specifically cater for the continued free movement of New Zealanders to Australia the [[Special Category Visa]] was introduced for New Zealanders.\n\n===Gulf Cooperation Council===\nMembers of the [[Gulf Cooperation Council]], or GCC, allow each other's citizens freedom of movement in an arrangement similar to the CTA and to that between India and Nepal. Such benefits are partially suspended for Qataris as a result of the Saudi-led blockade of the country.\n\n== Expedited border controls ==\nCertain countries and trade blocs establish programmes for high-frequency and/or low risk travellers to expedite border controls, subjecting them to lighter or automated checks, or priority border control facilities. In some countries, citizens or residents have access to automated facilities not available to foreigners.\n\n===British Isles===\n\n====United Kingdom====\n[[File:Heathrow Terminal 4 ePassport gates.jpg|right|thumb|ePassport gates in [[Heathrow Airport]] (Terminal 4)]]\n[[File:Heathrow Terminal 5 ePassport gates.jpg|right|thumb|ePassport gates in [[Heathrow Airport]] (Terminal 5)]]\n[[ePassport gates]] are operated by the [[UK Border Force]] and are located at immigration checkpoints in the arrival halls of some airports across the United Kingdom, offering an alternative to using desks staffed by immigration officers.

The system can currently only be used by travellers 12 years of age or older, however a trial is under way that may potentially lower the age of eligibility to use eGate for people with an eligible ePassport from 12 years of age to 10 years of age. New Zealand eGates utilise biometric technology, comparing the picture of your face in your ePassport with the picture it takes of you at the gate in order to confirm your identity. To make sure eGate can do this, travellers must make sure they look as similar to their ePassport photos as possible and remove glasses, scarves and hats that they were not wearing when their passport picture was taken. eGate can handle minor changes in your face, for example if the travellers' weight or hair has changed. Customs, Biosecurity and Immigration officials utilise information provided at eGates, including photos, to clear travellers and their items across New Zealand's border. Biometric information is kept for three months before destruction but other information, including about movements across New Zealand's border is kept indefinitely and handled in accordance with the [[Right to privacy in New Zealand#Privacy Act 1993|Privacy Act 1993]], or as the law authorises. This might include information being used by or shared with other law enforcement or border control authorities.\n\nFrom 1 July 2019 visitors from the 60 Visa Waiver countries will require a New Zealand electronic Travel Authority (NZeTA).

It provides visa exemptions and access to expedited border control facilities. ABTC holders are eligible for expedited border control at Canadian airports but not for any visa exemptions.\n\nABTCs are generally issued only to citizens of APEC member countries, however Hong Kong issues them to Permanent Residents who are not Chinese citizens, a category primarily consisting of British, Indian, and Pakistani citizens.\n\nThe use of ABTCs in China is restricted as a result of the [[One Country, Two Systems]] and [[One China Policy|One China]] policies. [[Taiwanese nationality law|Taiwanese nationals]], and [[Chinese nationality law|Chinese citizens]] from [[Hong Kong residents|Hong Kong]], and [[Macau Resident Identity Card|Macau]] are required to use special internal travel documents to enter [[China|the mainland]]. Similar restrictions exist on the use of ABTC for Chinese citizens of other regions entering [[Taiwan]]. (see: [[Border control#Internal border controls|Internal border controls]]).\n\n==Internal border controls==\n\n===Asia===\n\nSome countries maintain border controls within their own territory. These are not uncommon in some parts of Asia. For example, minority regions in India and China often require special permits (i.e. [[Foreigners (Protected Areas) Order 1958 (India)|Restricted Area Permits, Protected Area Permits]], [[Visa policy of China#Tibet Autonomous Region|Tibet Travel Permits, or Alien Travel Permits]]) for foreign nationals to enter in addition to visas where required. In some cases, these restrictions are not limited to foreigners. For instance, certain minority areas of India additionally require Indian citizens to possess an [[Inner Line Permit]] to enter. Similarly, the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] ([[Classical Tibetan|Tibetan]]: \u0f56\u0f7c\u0f51\u0f0b\u0f62\u0f44\u0f0b\u0f66\u0f90\u0fb1\u0f7c\u0f44\u0f0b\u0f63\u0f97\u0f7c\u0f44\u0f66\u0f0d) in China exempts Chinese citizens from the Mainland, Hong Kong, and Macau to obtain TTPs and ATPs {{citation needed|date=October 2019}}. [[Taiwanese nationality law|Taiwanese people]] are required to obtain those permits even though, in the PRC, nationals of the ROC are commonly known as \"Taiwanese compatriots\" in news articles and for legislation purposes, '''\"Chinese citizens residing in Taiwan\"'''.<ref>Article 2 of the {{cite web|title=Measures for the Administration of Chinese Citizens Travelling to or from Taiwan Region|url =http://en.pkulaw.cn/display.aspx?cgid=250073&lib=law |publisher=Peking University Center for Legal Information }}</ref>\n\nInternal air and rail travel within non-autonomous portions of India and mainland China also generally requires travel documents to be checked by government officials as a form of interior border checkpoint. For such travel within India, Indian citizens may utilise their [[Voter ID (India)|Voter ID]], [[Aadhaar|National Identity Card]], passport, or other proof of Indian citizenship whilst Nepali nationals may present any similar proof of Napali citizenship. Meanwhile, for such travel within mainland China, Chinese nationals from the mainland are required to use their national identity cards.\n\nWithin China, extensive border controls are maintained for those travelling between the [[Mainland China|mainland]], [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|special administrative regions]] of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], and [[Free area of the Republic of China|areas controlled by the Republic of China]].{{efn|name=ROC|The area under the definition consists of the island groups of [[Geography of Taiwan|Taiwan]], [[Penghu]] (the Pescadores), [[Kinmen]] (Quemoy), [[Matsu Islands]] and [[List of islands of Taiwan|other islands]].}} Foreign nationals need to present their passports or other types of travel documents when travelling between these areas. For Chinese nationals (including those with [[British National (Overseas)]] status), there are special [[travel document|documents]]{{efn|For example, [[Hong Kong Permanent Identity Card]] or [[Macau Identity Card]] and [[Home Return Permit]] are required for Hong Kong or Macau Permanent Residents who are Chinese citizens to cross the border, whilst mainlanders require a two-way permit.}} for travel between these territories. Similar arrangements, in the form of the [[Mainland Travel Permit for Taiwan Residents]] issued by mainland authority and [[Exit & Entry Permit|similar permits]] issued by Taiwan authorities exist for travel between Taiwan and territories controlled by the [[People\u2019s Republic of China]]. Internal border controls in the Chinese Special Administrative Regions have also meant that immigrants from the mainland require a [[People's Republic of China Permit for Proceeding to Hong Kong and Macao|One Way Travel Permit]], the issuance of which is controlled by the mainland government, thus giving that region of China greater control over emigration rather than by Hong Kong or Macau as would be expected of border controls aimed at curtailing immigration.\n\nAnother example is the [[Malaysia]]n states of [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]], which have maintained their own border controls<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.lonelyplanet.com/borneo/visas |title = Visas and customs in Borneo}}</ref> since joining Malaysia in 1963. The internal border control is asymmetrical; while Sabah and Sarawak impose immigration control on Malaysian citizens from other states, there is no corresponding border control in [[Peninsular Malaysia]], and Malaysians from Sabah and Sarawak have unrestricted right to live and work in the Peninsular. For social and business visits less than three months, Malaysian citizens may travel between the Peninsular, Sabah and Sarawak using the [[Malaysian identity card]] (MyKad) or [[Malaysian passport]], while for longer stays in Sabah and Sarawak they are required to have an Internal Travel Document or a passport with the appropriate residential permit.\n\nMeanwhile, in Bhutan, a microstate accessible by road only through India, there are interior border checkposts (primarily on the [[Lateral Road]]) and, additionally, certain areas require [[Visa policy of Bhutan#Restricted areas permit|special permits]] to enter, whilst visitors not proceeding beyond the border city of [[Phuentsholing]] do not need permits to enter for the day (although such visitors are [[de facto]] subject to Indian visa policy since they must proceed through [[Jaigaon]]). Individuals who are not citizens of India, Bangladesh, or the Maldives are not allowed to proceed past Phuentsholing by land and are instead required to arrive by air at the country's [[Paro Airport|sole international airport]] in [[Paro, Bhutan|Paro]], which has flights from India and other countries in the Greater India region such as Thailand, Singapore, and Nepal.\n\nThe most restrictive internal border controls are in [[North Korea]]. Citizens are not allowed to travel outside their areas of residence without explicit authorisation, and access to the capital city of Pyongyang is heavily restricted.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country%2C%2C%2C%2CPRK%2C4562d8cf2%2C487ca236c0%2C0.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018022844/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country%2C%2C%2C%2CPRK%2C4562d8cf2%2C487ca236c0%2C0.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=2012-10-18 |title = UNHCR &#124; Refworld &#124; Freedom in the World 2008 - North Korea}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/ASA24/002/2009/en/ | title=Document}}</ref> Similar restrictions are imposed on tourists, who are only allowed to leave Pyongyang on government-authorised tours to approved tourist sites.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:RAP Immigration Stamp.JPG|Domestic Immigration stamp permitting entry into the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in India.\nFile:Republic of China Multiple Exit and Entry Permit (China Mainland Citizen).jpg|Data page of a booklet type [[Exit & Entry Permit|internal travel document]] issued by Taiwan authorities to a Mainland Chinese resident.\nFile:AadhaarCard.jpg|A sample of the Indian national identity card (variant with Tamil as a regional language and English as the federal language), one of the documents that may be used to clear domestic controls at airports.

Other similar documents include Restricted Area Permits and Protected Area permits primarily issued to enter India\u2019s northeast. \n</gallery>\n\n===Europe===\n\nAn example from Europe is the implementation of border controls on travel between [[Svalbard]], which maintains a policy of [[free migration]] as a result of the [[Svalbard Treaty]] and the Schengen Area, which includes the rest of Norway. Other examples of effective internal border controls in Europe include the [[closed cities]] of certain [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] members, [[Visa policy of Turkmenistan#Special permits|areas of Turkmenistan]] that require special permits to enter, [[Visa policy of Tajikistan#Gorno-Badakhshan|restrictions]] on travel to the [[Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region]] in Tajikistan, and (depending on whether Northern and Southern Cyprus are considered separate countries) the Cypriot border. Similarly, Iraq's [[Iraqi Kurdistan|Kurdistan region]] maintains a separate and more liberal visa and customs area from the rest of the country, even allowing [[Visa policy of Iraq|visa free entry]] for Israelis whilst the rest of the country bans them from entering. [[Denmark]] also maintains a complex system of subnational countries with autonomous customs policies, since they aren't within the European Union like the Danish mainland. These are [[Greenland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]]. These areas do not maintain strict immigration controls with the Schengen Area, but border controls are sporadically enforced for customs purposes.\n\nIn addition to the numerous closed cities of Russia,<ref>{{cite web|title=Russian Federation Country Specific Information \u2013 Entry/Exit Requirements for U.S. Citizens|url=http://www.travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1006.html#entry_requirements|publisher=Bureau of Consular Affairs, U.S. Department of State|accessdate=18 November 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203003453/http://www.travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1006.html#entry_requirements|archivedate=3 December 2013}}</ref> parts of 19 subjects{{efn|\n* 1.

Spread throughout the [[Israel|State of Israel]] and the areas of the [[State of Palestine]] under de facto Israeli control, internal checkpoints are a key feature of Israeli and Palestinian life, and Israel\u2019s internal border controls are amongst the most restrictive in the world.\n\nAn unusual example of internal border controls pertains to customs enforcement within the Schengen area. Even though borders are generally invisible, the existence of areas within the Schengen area but outside the [[European Union Value Added Tax Area]], as well as jurisdictions such as Andorra which are not officially a part of the Schengen area but can not be accessed without passing through it, has resulted in the existence of sporadic [[Schengen Area#Internal controls|internal border controls]] for customs purposes. Additionally, as per Schengen area rules,<ref>[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/;jsessionid=TJcLTTkLTbF0zDNTTm0Z2GGMzHlM1QGpWP9mdKGRx6WlrfTlb2GQ!1620842458?uri=CELEX:32006R0562 Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 March 2006 establishing a Community Code on the rules governing the movement of persons across borders (Schengen Borders Code)] See Title III Article 21</ref> hotels and other types of commercial accommodation must register all foreign citizens, including citizens of other Schengen states, by requiring the completion of a registration form by their own hand. This does not apply to accompanying spouses and minor children or members of travel groups. In addition, a valid identification document has to be produced to the hotel manager or staff.<ref>Article 45 of the Schengen Convention.</ref> The Schengen rules do not require any other procedures; thus, the Schengen states are free to regulate further details on the content of the registration forms, and identity documents which are to be produced, and may also require the persons exempted from registration by Schengen laws to be registered. A Schengen state is also permitted to reinstate border controls with another Schengen country for a short period where there is a serious threat to that state's \"public policy or internal security\" or when the \"control of an external border is no longer ensured due to exceptional circumstances\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20120608-european-union-schengen-border-control-migrants-refugees |title=EU agrees short-term border closures to block migrants |date=8 June 2012 |accessdate=8 August 2012}}</ref> When such risks arise out of foreseeable events, the state in question must notify the European Commission in advance and consult with other Schengen states.<ref>Chapter II of the Schengen Borders Code ([http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32006R0562:EN:NOT OJ L 105, 13 April 2006, p. 1]).</ref> In April 2010 Malta introduced temporary checks due to [[Pope Benedict XVI]]'s visit.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20100405/local/border-checks-are-back |title=Border checks are back |newspaper=Times of Malta |date=5 April 2010 |accessdate=9 May 2010}}</ref> It reimposed checks in 2015 in the weeks surrounding the [[CHOGM 2015|Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting]].

Whilst the [[crown dependencies]] are within the [[Common Travel Area]], neither [[Gibraltar]] nor the sovereign British military exclaves of [[Akrotiri and Dhekelia]] are. The former maintains its own [[Visa policies of British Overseas Territories#Gibraltar|border control policies]], thus requiring physical border security at its border with the Schengen Area as well as the implementation of border controls for travellers proceeding directly between Gibraltar and the British mainland. The latter maintains a relatively open border with Southern Cyprus, though not with Northern Cyprus. Consequently, it is a de facto member of the Schengen Area and travel to or from the British mainland requires border controls.\n\nThe [[Peace lines|Peace Lines]] in Northern Ireland are a de facto internal border security measure to separate Catholic/Republican communities and Protestant/Unionist communities from each other.

These include the maintenance of [[Visa policy of the United States#Visa waiver programs of Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands|autonomous]] or [[Visa policy of the United States#American Samoa|separate immigration policies]] in each of America\u2019s major territories in the Pacific, i.e. [[Guam]], [[American Samoa]], and the [[Northern Mariana Islands]]. Each of these territories maintains its own visa exemptions, and there are consequently immigration and customs checks on travel between the these territories and the American mainland.\n\nThe US Virgin Islands are a special case, falling within America\u2019s immigration zone but being a customs free territory. As a result, there are no immigration checks between the two but there travellers arriving in Puerto Rico or the American mainland directly from the Virgin Islands are subject to border control for customs inspection. America also maintains [[United States Border Patrol interior checkpoints|interior checkpoints]], similar to those maintained by Bhutan, along its borders with Mexico and Canada, subjecting people to border controls even after they have entered the country. The city of [[Hyder, Alaska]] has also been subject to internal border controls since the United States chose to stop regulating arrivals in Hyder from British Columbia. Since travellers exiting Hyder into British Columbia are subject to Canadian border controls, it is theoretically possible for someone to accidentally enter Hyder from Canada without their travel documents and then to face difficulties since both America and Canada would subject them to border controls that require travel documents.\n\n===Realm of New Zealand===\n[[File:Niue passport stamp (entry).png|right|150px|thumbnail|Niue entry stamp issued at [[Hanan International Airport]]]]\n{{main|Visa policy of New Zealand}}\n{{further|Realm of New Zealand}}\n\n[[Tokelau]], [[Niue]], and the [[Cook Islands]] ([[Cook Islands M\u0101ori]]: ''K\u016bki '\u0100irani'')<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=AT2ENAHoS28C ''Cook Islands Maori dictionary''] by Jasper Buse & Raututi Taringa, Cook Islands Ministry of Education (1995) page 200</ref> maintain independent and less restrictive border controls from New Zealand.

This process is intended to streamline border procedures, reduce congestion at ports of entry, and facilitate travel between the preclearance location and U.S. airports unequipped to handle international travellers.\n\nThese facilities are present at the majority of major Canadian airports, as well as selected airports in Bermuda, Aruba, the Bahamas, Abu Dhabi<ref>{{cite news |url = http://ph.news.yahoo.com/us-customs-pre-clearance-facility-opens-uae-162934663--sector.html |title = US Customs pre-clearance facility opens in UAE |work = Yahoo!

Normally they are performed and organised by private companies, based on a law that they have to check that passengers don't travel into a specific country if they aren't allowed to. Such controls can take effect in one country based on the law of another country without any formalised border control prescreening agreement in force. Even if they aren't border controls they function as such. The most prominent example is airlines which check passports and visa before passengers are allowed to board the aircraft. Also for some passenger boats such check are performed before boarding.\n\n==Border control organisations==\n{{further|Border guard}}\nBorder controls are usually the responsibility of specialised government organisations. Such agencies may oversee various aspects of border control, such as [[Customs (tax)|customs]], immigration policy, border security, [[quarantine]], and other such aspects. Official designations, jurisdictions and command structures of these agencies vary considerably, and some countries split border control functions across multiple agencies.\n\n===India===\n====Border Security Force====\n[[File:BSF Logo.svg|167px|thumb|Insignia of the Border Security Force]]\n{{main|Border Security Force}}\n\nThe Border Security Force, or BSF, is the primary border defence organisation of India.

The Border Guard is a paramilitary organization, subordinate to the Ministry of the Interior in administrative issues and to the President of the Republic in issues pertaining to the president's authority as Commander-in-Chief (e.g. officer promotions). The [[Finland-Russia border]] is a controlled external border of the Schengen Area, routinely patrolled and protected by a [[Border control#Border zones|border zone]] enforced by the Border Guard. Finland's borders with Norway and Sweden are internal Schengen borders with no routine border controls, but the Border Guard maintains personnel in the area owing to its search and rescue (SAR) duties. There are two coast guard districts for patrolling maritime borders. In peacetime, the Border Guard trains [[special forces]] and [[light infantry]] and can be incorporated fully or in part into the [[Finnish Defence Forces]] when required by defence readiness. The Border Guard has police and investigative powers in immigration matters and can independently investigate immigration violations. The Border Guard has search and rescue (SAR) duties, both maritime and inland. The Guard operates SAR helicopters that are often used in inland SAR, in assistance of a local fire and rescue department or other authorities. The Border Guard shares border control duties with Finnish Customs, which inspects arriving goods, and the [[Finnish Police]], which enforces immigration decisions such as removal.\n\n====Swedish border police====\nThe border control is handled by a special group in the police force. Sweden has natural land borders only to Norway and Finland, where there are no border controls, so border surveillance is not done there apart from customs control. Therefore, border control is focused on some fixed control points, during the border control-less Schengen period until 2015 mainly airports. The [[Schengen Area#Temporary border controls|introduction of full border control]] from Denmark and the continent in 2015 put a heavy load on the border police who had to check 8000 cars and 50 trains per day coming over the [[\u00d6resund Bridge]], and 3000 cars in [[Helsingborg]] and more in other ferry ports. The police quickly educated several hundred semi-authorised border control guards who had to ask the real officers to take over any doubtful case. The customs office and the coast guard can not do formal border controls, but can stop people in doubtful cases and ask police to take over.\n\n===China===\n====Hong Kong====\n{{main|Immigration Department (Hong Kong)}}\n\nThe Immigration Department of Hong Kong is responsible for border controls of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Regions, including [[Border control#Internal border controls|internal controls]] with the rest of China.

In addition, [[Visa policy of Hong Kong|visa-free entry]] acceptance regulations into Hong Kong for passport holders of some 170 countries remain unchanged before and after 1997.\n\n====Macau====\nThe Immigration Department of Macau, under the [[Public Security Police Force of Macau|Public Security Police Force]], is the government agency responsible for immigration matters, whilst the Public Security Police Force itself is responsible for enforcing immigration laws in Macau.<ref>[http://www.fsm.gov.mo/psp/por/psp_top9_map_sm.html Servi\u00e7o de Migra\u00e7\u00e3o]</ref>\n\n====Mainland China====\nBorder security in [[Mainland China]] are the responsibility of National Immigration Administration of the People's Republic of China, formerly the Exit & Entry Administration<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.moj.gov.cn/news/content/2018-04/02/zfyw_17882.html|title=National Immigration Administration Listing Ceremony Held|last=|first=|date=|website=Ministry of Justice of the People's Republic of China|access-date=}}</ref>), a unit of [[Ministry of Public Security (China)|the Ministry of Public Security of the People's Republic of China]].

Independent Bantustans (Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda and Ciskei; also known as the TBVC states) were intended to be fully sovereign. In reality, they had no economic infrastructure worth mentioning and with few exceptions encompassed swaths of disconnected territory. This meant all the Bantustans were little more than puppet states controlled by South Africa. Throughout the existence of the independent Bantustans, South Africa remained the only country to recognise their independence. Nevertheless, internal organisations of many countries, as well as the South African government, lobbied for their recognition. For example, upon the foundation of Transkei, the [[Swiss-South African Association]] encouraged the Swiss government to recognise the new state. In 1976, leading up to a [[United States House of Representatives]] resolution urging the President to not recognise Transkei, the South African government intensely lobbied lawmakers to oppose the bill.

Governments may forbid unauthorised entry to or exit from border zones and restrict property ownership in the area. The zones function as [[buffer zone]]s specifically monitored by [[border guard|border patrols]] in order to prevent illegal entry or exit. Restricting entry aids in pinpointing illegal intruders, since by ''[[nulla poena sine lege]]'' (\"no penalty without a law\"), any person could be present in the area near the border, and illegal intruders, such as illegal immigrants, smugglers or spies could blend in. However, if all unauthorised presence is forbidden, their mere presence of intruders allows the authorities to arrest them. Border zones between hostile states can be heavily militarised, with [[minefield]]s, barbed wire and [[watchtower]]s. Some border zones are designed to prevent illegal immigration or emigration, and do not have many restrictions but may operate checkpoints to check immigration status. In most places, a [[border vista]] is usually included and/or required. In some nations, movement inside a border zone without a licence is an offence and will result in arrest. No probable cause is required as mere presence inside the zone is an offence, if it is intentional.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.minilex.fi/a/valtionrajarikos-koskee-suomen-rajaa |title=Valtionrajarikos koskee Suomen rajaa - Minilex |accessdate=2016-09-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609210740/http://www.minilex.fi/a/valtionrajarikos-koskee-suomen-rajaa |archivedate=2016-06-09 }}</ref> Even with a licence to enter, photography, making fires, and carrying of firearms and hunting are prohibited.\n\nExamples of international border zones are the [[Border Security Zone of Russia]] and the Finnish border zone on the [[Finnish\u2013Russian border]]. There are also intra-country zones such as the [[Cactus Curtain]] surrounding the [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base]] in Cuba, the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone|Korean Demilitarised Zone]] along the [[North Korea]]-[[South Korea]] demarcation line and the [[Frontier Closed Area]] in [[Hong Kong]]. Important historical examples are the [[Wire of Death]] set up by [[the German Empire]] to control the [[Belgium\u2013Netherlands border]] and the [[Iron Curtain]], a set of border zones maintained by the Soviet Union and its satellite states along their borders with Western states. One of the most militarised parts was the [[Inner German border#Restricted zone|restricted zone of the inner German border]]. While initially and officially the zone was for border security, eventually it was engineered to prevent escape from the Soviet sphere into the West. Ultimately, the [[Eastern Bloc|Soviet Bloc]] governments resorted to using lethal countermeasures against those trying to cross the border, such as mined fences and orders to shoot anyone trying to cross into the West. The restrictions on building and habitation made the area a \"green corridor\", today established as the [[European Green Belt]].\n\nIn the area stretching inwards from its [[Border control#Internal border controls|internal border]] with the [[Mainland China|mainland]], Hong Kong maintains a [[Frontier Closed Area]] [[Exclusion zone|out of bounds]] to those without special authorisation. The area was established in the 1950s when Hong Kong under British occupation as a consequence of the [[Treaty of Nanjing]] during the [[Opium Wars]], prior to the [[Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong]] in 1997. The purposes of the area were to prevent illegal immigration and smuggling; smuggling had become prevalent as a consequence of the Korean war. Today, under the [[one country, two systems]] policy, the area continues to be used to curtail unauthorised migration to Hong Kong and the smuggling of goods in either direction.\n\n[[File:DMZ from North Korea side (14319637755).jpg|left|thumb|125px|Korean Demilitarised Zone as seen from the North]]\n\nAs a result of the partition of the Korean peninsula by America and the Soviet Union after World War II, and exacerbated by the subsequent [[Korean war]], there is a [[Korean Demilitarized Zone|Demilitarised Zone]] spanning the [[de facto]] border between [[North Korea|North]] and [[South Korea]]. The Demilitarised Zone follows the effective boundaries as of the end of the Korean War in 1953. Similarly to the Frontier Closed Area in Hong Kong, this zone and the defence apparatus that exists on both sides of the border serve to curtail unauthorised passage between the two sides. In South Korea, there is an additional fenced-off area between the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone#Civilian Control Line|Civilian Control Line]] and the start of the Demilitarised Zone, further strengthening border security\n\n===Immigration policy===\nImmigration policy is the aspect of border control concerning the transit of people into a country, especially those that intend to stay and work in the country. Often, racial or religious bias is tied to immigration policy. Taxation, tariff and trade rules set out what goods immigrants may bring with them, and what services they may perform while temporarily in the country. [[Investment policy]] sometimes permits wealthy immigrants to invest in businesses in exchange for favourable treatment and eventual naturalisation. [[Agricultural policy]] may make exemptions for migrant farm workers, who typically enter a country only for the harvest season and then return home to a country or region in the [[Global South]] (such as Mexico or Jamaica from where America and Canada, respectively, often import temporary agricultural labour).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nardep.info/uploads/Brief_FarmWorker.pdf |title=Immigration and Farm Labor in the U.S. |publisher=National Agriculture and Rural Development Policy Center |date=May 4, 2013 |accessdate=2015-07-28}}</ref> An important aspect of immigration policy is the treatment of [[refugee]]s, more or less helpless or stateless people who throw themselves on the mercy of the state they try to enter, seeking refuge from actual or purported poor treatment in their country of origin. Asylum is sometimes granted to those who face persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion.\n\n====Special areas in Europe====\n[[Immigration]] policies in special areas in Europe can range from severely limiting migration, as in Greece's [[Mount Athos]], to allowing most types of migration, such as the [[free migration]]{{efn|Uniquely, the archipelago is an [[Visa policy of Svalbard|entirely visa-free zone]] under the terms of the Svalbard Treaty,<ref>[http://www.aljazeera.com/archive/2006/07/200841012024779644.html Immigrants warmly welcomed], [[Al Jazeera]], 4 July 2006.</ref> which recognises the sovereignty of Norway over the Arctic archipelago of [[Svalbard]] but subjects it to certain stipulations and consequently not all Norwegian law applies, including border controls.

For example, the Indian government confers Overseas Citizenship of India (OCI) status on foreign citizens of [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indian origin]] to live and work indefinitely in India. OCI status was introduced in response to demands for [[Multiple citizenship|dual citizenship]] by the Indian diaspora, particularly in countries with large populations of Indian origin. It was introduced by ''The Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2005'' in August 2005.<ref>[http://mha.nic.in/uniquepage.asp?Id_Pk=553 Overseas Citizenship of India (OCI); Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090926231018/http://mha.nic.in/uniquepage.asp?Id_Pk=553 |date=2009-09-26 }}, [http://www.moia.gov.in/services.aspx?id1=35&id=m3&idp=35&mainid=23 Diaspora Services: Overseas Citizenship of India Scheme] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504131659/http://moia.gov.in/services.aspx?id1=35&id=m3&idp=35&mainid=23 |date=2012-05-04 }}</ref> In the [[ASEAN]] region, a large portion of the Singaporean, Malaysian, and Bruneian population hold OCI status. Large OCI communities also exist in North America, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand, as well as in many African nations (particularly South Africa, Madagascar, and members of the [[East African Community]]). OCI status exempts holders from immigration controls generally imposed upon others of the same nationality.\n\nSimilarly, Poland issues the [[Karta Polaka]] to citizens of certain northeast European countries with Polish ancestry.\n\nA British Ancestry visa is a document issued by the United Kingdom to [[Commonwealth citizen]]s with a grandparent born in the United Kingdom, [[Channel Islands]] or [[Isle of Man]] who wish to work in the United Kingdom. Similar to OCI status, it exempts members of the country\u2019s diaspora from usual immigration controls. It is used mainly by young Australians, New Zealanders, Canadians and South Africans of [[British diaspora|British descent]] coming to UK to work and as a base to explore Europe.<ref name=tele>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2008/02/21/nvisa121.xml |title=Britain may abolish ancestry visa |location=London |work=The Daily Telegraph |first=Philip |last=Johnston |date=21 February 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080326202004/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fnews%2F2008%2F02%2F21%2Fnvisa121.xml |archivedate=March 26, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nSome nations recognise a [[right of return]] for people with ancestry in that country. A notable example of this is the right of [[Sephardi Jews]] to acquire Spanish nationality by virtue of their community\u2019s Spanish origins. Similar exemptions to immigration controls exist for people of Armenian origin seeking to acquire Armenian citizenship. Ghana, similarly, grants an indefinite right to stay in Ghana to members of the [[African diaspora]] regardless of citizenship.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theafricareport.com/West-Africa/ghana-a-place-for-african-americans-to-resettle.html |title=Ghana, a place for African Americans to resettle |last=Dovi |first=Efam |date=11 May 2015 |website=The Africa Report|publisher= |access-date=15 August 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n\n===International zones===\nAn international zone is a type of [[extraterritoriality|extraterritorial]] area not fully subject to any country\u2019s border control policies. The term most commonly refers to the areas of [[international airports]] after border exit controls or before border  entry controls. These areas often contain duty-free shopping, but they are not fully extraterritorial. It is usually possible to transfer between flights without needing either the  passport check or visa otherwise needed to enter the country. In areas of conflict there may be international zones called green zones that form protective enclaves to keep diplomats safe. Countries in conflict may also have international zones separating each other. Some of the international zones are subject to [[international law]].\n\n====Airport transit areas====\nThe international zone in an [[international airport]] is the area where arriving international passengers have not formally entered the country by clearing arrival customs and immigration controls, and departing passengers have formally exited the country by clearing exit immigration control. Transit passengers can take connecting international flights in the international zone without clearing customs and immigration controls, and in most cases do not require a [[travel visa|visa]].<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |title=Former Colleague Aided U.S. In Trapping Ex-C.I.A.

Each concession had its own police force, and different legal jurisdictions with their own separate laws. Thus, an activity might be legal in one concession but illegal in another. Many of the concessions also maintained their own military garrison and standing army. Military and police forces of the Chinese government were sometimes present. Some police forces allowed Chinese, others did not. In these concessions, the citizens of each foreign power were given the right to freely inhabit, trade, [[missionary|spread religious propaganda]], and travel. They developed their own sub-cultures, isolated and distinct from the intrinsic [[Chinese culture]], and colonial administrations attempted to give their concessions \"homeland\" qualities. Churches, [[public house]]s, and various other western commercial institutions sprang up in the concessions. In the case of Japan, its own traditions and language naturally flourished. Some of these concessions eventually had more advanced architecture of each originating culture than most cities back in the countries of the foreign powers origin. Chinese were originally forbidden from most of the concessions, but to improve commercial activity and services, by the 1860s most concessions permitted Chinese, but treated them like second-class citizens as they were not citizens of the foreign state administering the concession.  They eventually became the majority of the residents inside the concessions. Non-Chinese in the concessions were generally subject to [[Consul (representative)|consular]] law, and some of these laws applied to the Chinese residents. Notable Concessions include the [[Shanghai International Settlement]] administered by the United Kingdom and America, the [[Shanghai French Concession|French Concession in Shanghai]] , the [[Kwantung Leased Territory]], and the [[Beijing Legation Quarter]].\n* Iraq has an international zone around the Republican Palace in central [[Baghdad]] in a crook of the Tigris River.

This was never implemented; the city was the scene of fierce fighting in 1948 which culminated in its partition between Israel and Jordan. Nineteen years later in 1967 the Jordanian-occupied part was captured and unilaterally annexed by Israel. However, the idea of an international zone in Jerusalem, encompassing at least the highly sensitive [[Old City of Jerusalem]] , continues to be floated by various would-be mediators. Whilst it is often asserted that the [[World Zionist Organization|Zionist community]] favoured this plan, scholars such as [[Simha Flapan]] have determined that it is a myth that Zionists accepted the partition as a compromise by which the Jewish community abandoned ambitions for the whole of Palestine and recognised the rights of the Arab Palestinians to their own state. Rather, Flapan argued, acceptance was only a tactical move that aimed to thwart the creation of an Arab Palestinian state and, concomitantly, expand the territory that had been assigned by the UN to the Jewish state.<ref>Simha Flapan (1988).

Numerous merchants supplied goods and catering, and about 150 interpreters served. They all had to be paid by the Dutch East India Company. For two hundred years, foreign merchants were generally not allowed to cross from Dejima to Nagasaki.  The Japanese were likewise banned from entering Dejima, except interpreters, cooks, carpenters, clerks and 'Women of Pleasure' from the Maruyama teahouses. These ''[[Prostitution in Japan|y\u016bjo]]'' were handpicked from 1642 by the Japanese, often against their will. From the 18th century, there were some exceptions to this rule, especially following the policy of promoting European practical sciences implemented by [[Tokugawa Yoshimune]]. A limited number of Japanese were allowed to stay for longer periods, but they had to report regularly to the Japanese guard post. Once a year the Europeans were allowed to attend the festivities at the Suwa-Shrine under escort.

Italy fought with the [[Axis powers]] during the war, and when the Fascist regime collapsed in 1943 and Italy capitulated, the territory was occupied by [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Wehrmacht|forces]] who created the [[Operational Zone of the Adriatic Littoral]], the capital of which was Trieste. The [[Yugoslav People's Army|Yugoslav 4th Army]] and the Slovenian 9th Corps entered Trieste on 1 May 1945, after a battle in the town of [[Opicina]]. The [[2nd Division (New Zealand)]] arrived on the next day and forced the surrender of the 2,000 [[Wehrmacht|German Army]] troops holding out in Trieste, who warily had refused to capitulate to partisan troops, fearing they would be executed by them. An uneasy truce developed between New Zealand and Yugoslav troops occupying the area until British Gen. [[William Duthie Morgan|Sir William Morgan]] proposed a partition of the territory and the removal of Yugoslav troops from the area occupied by the Allies. Yugoslav leader [[Josip Broz Tito]] agreed in principle on 23 May, as the British XIII Corps was moving forward to the proposed demarcation line. An agreement was signed in [[Duino]] on 10 June, creating the [[Morgan Line]]. The Yugoslav troops withdrew by 12 June 1945.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cgi.stanford.edu/group/wais/cgi-bin/index.php?p=587|title=Stanford University|website=stanford.edu|accessdate=10 September 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060721202106/http://cgi.stanford.edu/group/wais/cgi-bin/index.php?p=587|archivedate=21 July 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ashburtonguardian.co.nz/index.asp?articleid=5112|title=Ashburton Guardian|website=ashburtonguardian.co.nz|accessdate=10 September 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060627095427/http://www.ashburtonguardian.co.nz/index.asp?articleid=5112|archivedate=27 June 2006}}</ref> Consequently, the area was designated an international zone as part of a bid to maintain this truce after the end of the war.

The buffer zone was established in 1974 due to ethnic tensions between [[Greek Cypriots|Greek]] and [[Turkish Cypriots]]. The green line is a demilitarised zone and thus acts in the same way as the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone|38th parallel]] separating the Republic of Korea and North Korea. The United Nations currently has its headquarters for the [[United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus|UNFICYP]] at the abandoned [[Nicosia International Airport]], where the majority of peacekeepers are based and where talks between the two governments are held.\n\n==Specific requirements==\n\nThe degree of strictness of border controls varies across countries and borders. In some countries, controls may be targeted at the traveller's religion, ethnicity, nationality, or other countries that have been visited. Others may need to be certain the traveller has paid the appropriate fees for their [[visa (document)|visas]] and has future travel planned out of the country. Yet others may concentrate on the contents of the traveler's baggage, and imported goods to ensure nothing is being carried that might bring a [[biosecurity]] risk into the country.\n\n===Border vistas===\n\n[[File:Border vista.jpg|thumb|upright|The vista along the [[Canada\u2013United States border]], as seen from a [[Rest area|wayside]] on the [[Alaska Highway]].]]\nA border vista or boundary vista is a defined cleared space between two areas of foliage located at an international border intended to provide a clear demarcation line between the two areas. Border vistas are most commonly found along undefended international boundary lines, where border security is not as much of a necessity and a built barrier is undesired, and are a treaty requirement for certain borders.\n\nAn example of a border vista is a six-metre cleared space around unguarded portions of the [[Canada\u2013United States border]].<ref>[[Stacy Schiff|Schiff, Stacy]]. [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/22/opinion/22schiff.html \"Politics Starts at the Border\"], ''The New York Times''. 22 July 2007. Accessed 3 August 2018.</ref>\n\nSimilar clearings along the border line are provided for by many international treaties. For example, the 2006 border management treaty [[China\u2013Russia border|between Russia and China]] provides for a {{convert|15|m|ft|adj=mid|-wide}} cleared strip along the two nations' border.<ref>[http://www.rosgranitsa.ru/ru/node/3140 Agreement between the Government of the Russian Federation and the Government of the People's Republic of China on the management of the Russia-China international border] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150709062825/http://www.rosgranitsa.ru/ru/node/3140 |date=2015-07-09 }}, rosgranitsa.ru</ref>\n\n===Travel documents===\n{{see also|Travel document|Passport}}\n\nDifferent countries impose varying travel document regulations and requirements as part of their border control policies and these may vary based on the traveller's mode of transport. For instance, whilst America does not subject passengers departing by land or most boats to any border control, it does require that passengers departing by air hold a valid passport (or certain specific passport-replacing documents). Even though travellers might not require a passport to enter a certain country, they ''will'' require a valid passport booklet (booklet only, U.S. Passport Card not accepted) to depart the United States in order to satisfy the U.S. immigration authorities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.iata.org/publications/timatic/Documents/using_timatic_v3.pdf|title=Page 7 of IATA document accessed 5 December 2015 at|publisher=}}</ref>\n[[File:Aeroport de dubai terminal 3 egate (echecking of passport).jpg|thumb|Passport control at [[Dubai Airport]]]].\nCanada requires any Canadian Permanent Residents entering the country by air to use their [[Canada permanent resident card|Permanent Resident Card]] or a special document authorising their return.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=1050&top=16|title=I am a permanent resident of Canada.

As a consequence of awkward border situations created by the fall of the Soviet Union, certain former members of the USSR and their neighbours require few or no travel documents for travellers transiting across international boundaries between two points in a single country. For instance, Russia permits vehicles to transit across the [[Saatse Boot]] between the Estonian villages of [[Lutep\u00e4\u00e4]] and [[Sesniki]] without any border control provided that they do not stop. Similar provisions are made for the issuance of Facilitated Rail Transit Documents by Schengen Area members for travel between Kaliningrad and the Russian mainland.\n\n====Indian Identity Certificate====\nThe Indian government issues Identity Certificates to members of the large Tibetan exile community. Identity Certificates are generally issued upon request of the Dalai Lama\u2019s Tibetan government in exile based in Dharamsala in northern India. This document is accepted as per most countries border control policies in lieu of a passport, although it is not a machine readable document. When issued to a Tibetan residing in India, it is invariably endorsed as being valid for return to India and therefore exempts the holder from requiring a visa to clear Indian border controls upon re-entry.\n\n====Non-citizen residents====\n[[File:United States Travel Document Cover Page.jpg|thumb|120px|The American re-entry permit is a travel document for permanent residents issued on request.]] [[File:2017-us-green-card-specimen.png|thumb|120px|American Green Card issued to all permanent residents.]] [[File:Japan Re-entry Permit 2012.png|thumb|left|120px|Japan re-entry permit issued to Japanese North Koreans and other stateless permanent residents of Japan]]\n\nSome countries issue travel documents to permanent residents (i.e. foreign citizens permitted to reside there indefinitely) or other non-citizens, usually for re-entry but also occasionally valid for international travel.\n\nThe American [[U.S. Re-entry Permit|re-entry permit]] is an example of such a document. Valid for international travel, it is issued to lawful permanent residents temporarily expatriating overseas. Unlike the [[Permanent residence (United States)|\u201dGreen Card\u201d]] issued to all permanent residents, this document is not mandatory. The American \u201cGreen Card\u201d, on its own or in conjunction with a passport, is valid for international travel albeit not to the same extent as the re-entry permit. Both documents can be utilised to clear American border controls regardless of the bearers nationality, thus resulting in America not requiring permanent residents to hold a passport from their home country in order to remain lawfully present or to lawfully enter.\n\nSingapore issues [[National Registration Identity Card|national identity cards]] to permanent residents in the same manner as it does to citizens, but additionally requires any permanent resident travelling abroad to hold a valid electronic re-entry permit and a passport or other travel document from their home country. Singapore permanent residents who are stateless are issued booklet-form [[Singapore Certificate of Identity|Certificates of Identity]] in lieu of a passport.\n\nIndonesia issues the [[Paspor Orang Asing]] to its stateless permanent residents.\n\nNon-citizens [[Non-citizen (Latvia)|in Latvia]] and [[Estonian nationality law|in Estonia]] are individuals, primarily of Russian or Ukrainian ethnicity, who are not citizens of Latvia or Estonia but whose families have resided in the area since the Soviet era, and thus have the right to a non-citizen passport issued by the Latvian government as well as other specific rights. Approximately two thirds of them are [[Russians in Latvia|ethnic Russians]], followed by ethnic Belarussians, ethnic Ukrainians, ethnic Poles and ethnic Lithuanians.<ref name=\"pmlp.gov.lv\">[http://www.pmlp.gov.lv/lv/assets/documents/statistika/01.01.2015/ISVN_Latvija_pec_TTB_VPD.pdf Population of Latvia by ethnicity and nationality; Office of Citizenship and Migration Affairs] 2015{{in lang|lv}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://vvc.gov.lv/export/sites/default/docs/LRTA/Likumi/On_the_Status_of_those_Former_U.S.S.R._Citizens.doc|title=Section 1 and Section 8, Law \"On the Status of those Former U.S.S.R.

They also issue the [[Hong Kong Document of Identity for Visa Purposes]] and [[Macao Special Administrative Region Travel Permit|Macau Travel Permit]], respectively, to stateless permanent residents and to Chinese citizens temporarily residing in the region holding neither permanent residence of Hong Kong or Macau nor residence status in the mainland.\n\nSimilarly, [[Ch\u014dsen-seki|Japanese North Koreans]] are issued a Japan Re-entry Permit for international travel.\n\n====National identity cards and birth certificates====\n{{multiple image\n| width = 160\n| image1=DNIArg-anv-wikipedia.jpg |\n| image2=DNIArg-rev-wikipedia.jpg |\n| footer = Argentinian [[Documento Nacional de Identidad (Argentina)|National ID card]] valid for travel to other [[Mercosur]] countries in lieu of a passport\n}}\n\nCertain jurisdictions permit the use of national identity cards to clear border controls. For instance, when travelling between India and Nepal or Bhutan, Indian citizens may utilise national voter ID cards, ration cards, or [[Aadhar|national identity cards]]. Indian citizens may also obtain identity slips at the Indian consulate in Phuentsholing if they intend to proceed beyond city limits as Phuentsholing, the financial capital of Bhutan, is de facto within India\u2019s visa and customs area. When travelling to India, citizens of Nepal and Bhutan can utilise similar documents. Children may use birth certificates as proof of identity.\n\nIn North America, American citizens may travel using [[United States Passport Card|passport cards]], a form of voluntary identity card issued to American citizens. Children holding American or Canadian citizenship may travel to and from Canada using birth certificates under certain circumstances. In South America, many [[Mercosur]] countries reciprocally permit travel using identity cards.\n\nIn western Europe, travel using identity cards is relatively common for citizens of the European Economic Area and adjacent territories. This includes travel to and from Turkey for certain citizens of other countries in western Europe. Within the Schengen Area, there are limited border controls in place and national identity cards may be used to clear them.\n\n====Chinese Travel Document====\n[[File:TD PRC.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Chinese Travel Document]]\nThe Chinese Government requires certain people to enter the mainland using a [[Chinese Travel Document]]. Some cases include:\n* When it is \"inconvenient\", \"unnecessary\", or not permitted to issue a [[People's Republic of China passport]] to Chinese nationals.<ref>[http://www.gov.cn/banshi/2005-06/01/content_3133.htm What's the difference between a Travel Document and a Passport?] {{in lang|zh}} Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China.</ref>\n* Chinese nationals residing in [[Mainland China]] who lost their passport while travelling abroad may apply for this document as an emergency passport for returning to China.\n* Chinese nationals who are permanent residents of Hong Kong and [[Macau]] intending to enter Mainland China directly from other countries without a [[Home Return Permit]].\n* Residents of the Taiwan area{{efn|name=ROC}} intending to enter Mainland China or Hong Kong directly from other countries, who are Chinese nationals according to Chinese law. Travelling to Hong Kong, however, requires a separate application for a visa-like entry permit.\n* Chinese nationals born abroad who acquired Chinese nationality at birth in accordance with the [[Nationality Law of the People's Republic of China]] through ''[[jus sanguinis]]''. The Chinese Travel Document is issued as a Chinese identification and travel document.\n* Chinese nationals born in China who do not have a Hukou in China and who have exited China using an exit permit. This could include a person who holds a non-Chinese passport.\n\n====Enhanced Driving Licence====\nAn [[Enhanced Drivers License|Enhanced Driving Licence]] is a document issued by provincial and state authorities in Canada and America that enables its bearer to clear border controls along the border between the two countries. It is not valid for air travel and does not permit its holder to clear border controls at airports. It also serves as a valid driving licence. Certain provinces and states may issue similar enhanced versions of regional identity cards issued to individuals who do not drive.\n\n====Quilantan entry====\nA \u2018Quilantan\u2019 or \u2018Wave Through\u2019 Entry is a phenomenon in American border control law authorising a form of non-standard but legal entry without any inspection of travel documents. It occurs when the border security personnel present at a border crossing choose to summarily admit some number of persons without performing a standard interview or document examination.<ref>{{cite court |litigants=Matter of Graciela QUILANTAN, Respondent |reporter=A095 426 631 |court=Board of Immigration Appeals |date=2010-07-28 |url=https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/eoir/legacy/2014/07/25/3688.pdf }}</ref>\n\nTypically this can occur when an official border crossing is busy and an immigration officer waves a car through without first checking all passengers for their travel documents. If an individual can prove that they were waved into the United States in this manner, then they are considered to have entered with inspection despite not having answered any questions or received a passport [[Passport stamp|entry stamp]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=Matter of Quilantan helps immigrant |journal=Lexis/Nexis |date=2012-01-17 |last=Kowalski |first=Daniel M. |url=https://www.lexisnexis.com/legalnewsroom/immigration/b/insidenews/archive/2012/01/17/matter-of-quilantan-helps-immigrant.aspx?Redirected=true |accessdate=2017-12-07 |quote=Because she wasn't trying to sneak across and hadn't been questioned by the immigration officer who waved them into Texas, the court found she had been \"inspected and admitted\" legally. }}</ref>\n\nThis definition of legal entry does not apply to situations where foreigners entered the United States but have not crossed at a legal, manned border station.

For example, the relaxed border controls maintained by Bhutan for those not proceeding past Phuentsholing and certain other border cities enable travellers to enter without going through any document check whatsoever. The American [[Border Crossing Card]] issued to Mexican nationals enables Mexicans to enter border areas without a passport.{{efn|As a standalone document, the BCC allows Mexican citizens to visit border areas in America when entering by land or sea directly from Mexico for less than 72 hours.<ref>[https://mx.usembassy.gov/visas/domestic-employees/frequently-asked-questions/?_ga=1.54366443.213467364.1464033918 Frequently Asked Questions]</ref> The document also functions as a full B1/B2 visa when presented with a valid Mexican passport.<ref name=\"BCC1\">[https://help.cbp.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/1635/~/border-crossing-card---who-can-use-it%3F Border Crossing Card \u2013 Who can use it?]</ref>}} Both America and Bhutan maintain [[Border control#Internal borders|interior checkposts]] to enforce compliance.\n\nSimilarly, Schengen states which share an external land border with a non-EU member state are authorised by virtue of the EU Regulation 1931/2006 to conclude or maintain bilateral agreements with neighbouring third countries for the purpose of implementing a [[local border traffic]] regime.<ref>Corrigendum to Regulation (EC) No 1931/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 December 2006 laying down rules on local border traffic at the external land borders of the Member States and amending the provisions of the Schengen Convention ([http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32006R1931R%2801%29:EN:NOT OJ L 29, 3 February 2007, p. 3]).</ref> Such agreements define a [[border area]] on either side of the border, and provide for the issuance of local border traffic permits to residents of the border area. Permits may be used to cross the EU external border within the border area, are not stamped on crossing the border and must display the holder's name and photograph, as well as a statement that its holder is not authorised to move outside the border area and that any abuse shall be subject to penalties.\n\n===Agricultural restrictions===\n\nIn certain countries, border control focuses extensively on curtailing and regulating the import of foreign agricultural products. For example, Australian border controls restrict most (if not all) food products, certain wooden products and other similar items.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.agriculture.gov.au/travelling/arriving-in-australia |title = Department of Agriculture Fact sheet - Travelling or returning to Australia}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://newzealand.embassy.gov.au/wltn/customsfaq.html |title = Australian High Commission in}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/busi/cargo-support-trade-and-goods/importing-goods/prohibited-and-restricted |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-08-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180907224853/https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/busi/cargo-support-trade-and-goods/importing-goods/prohibited-and-restricted |archive-date=2018-09-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Similar restrictions exist in Canada, America and New Zealand.\n\n===Drugs===\n[[File:SingaporeEmbarkationCard.png|thumb|160px|Singapore arrival card warning visitors about the [[Capital punishment for drug trafficking|death penalty for drug trafficking]].]]\nBorder controls in many countries in the Greater India region prioritise mitigating trade in narcotics. For instance, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia impose mandatory death sentences on individuals caught smuggling restricted substances across their borders. For example, Muhammad Ridzuan Ali was executed in Singapore on 19 May 2017 for drug trafficking.<ref>{{cite news|title=Singaporean drug trafficker executed at Changi Prison for heroin offence|url=http://str.sg/4u3w|accessdate=21 August 2018|work=The Straits Times|date=19 May 2017|language=en}}</ref> India and Malaysia are focusing resources on eliminating drug smuggling from Myanmar and Thailand respectively. The issue stems largely from the high output of dangerous and illegal drugs in the [[Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia)|Golden Triangle]] as well as in regions further west such as Afghanistan.\n\nA similar problem exists east of the Pacific, and has resulted in countries such as Mexico and America tightening border control in response to the northward flow of illegal substances from regions such as Colombia. The [[Mexican Drug War]] and similar cartel activity in neighbouring areas has exacerbated the problem.\n\n===Visas===\n[[File:Indian Tourist Visa 2016 stamped.jpg|150px|thumb|Example of a tourist visa placed directly inside the travel document of a stateless individual.]] [[File:Singapore visa issued to stateless person.jpg|thumb|135px|left|Multiple entry visa issued to a [[statelessness|stateless]] person, whose lack of nationality is indicated with the code XXA]] [[File:Malaysia ENTRI.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Sample of printed out eNTRI slip for Indian and mainland Chinese citizens to clear Malaysian border controls without a visa.]]\n[[File:Thai Visa on Arrival.jpg|105px|thumb|left|Visa issued on arrival in Thailand]]\n\nMost countries impose visa requirements on foreign nationals, and depending on the country's border control strategy these can be liberal or restrictive.\n\nMany countries in the Greater India region have liberalised their visa controls in recent years to encourage transnational business and tourism. For example, [[Visa policy of India|India]], [[Visa policy of Myanmar|Myanmar]], and [[Visa policy of Sri Lanka|Sri Lanka]] have introduced electronic visas to make border control less of a bureaucratic hurdle for business travellers and tourists. [[Visa policy of Malaysia|Malaysia]] has introduced similar eVisa facilities, and has also introduced the eNTRI programme to expedite clearance for Indian citizens and Chinese citizens from the mainland. [[Visa policy of Thailand|Thailand regularly issues]] visas on arrival to many non-exempt visitors at major ports of entry in order to encourage tourism. Indonesia, in recent years, has progressively liberalised [[Visa policy of Indonesia|its visa regime]], no longer requiring visas or on-arrival visas from most nationals, while [[Visa policy of Singapore|Singapore]] has signed visa waiver agreements with many countries in recent years and has introduced electronic visa facilities for Indians, Eastern Europeans, and mainland Chinese. This trend towards visa liberalisation in the Greater India region is part of the broader phenomenon of [[globalisation]] and has been linked to heightened economic growth.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/south-east-asia-can-benefit-greatly-from-globalisation-if-countries-work-together-ong|title=Asia can benefit greatly from globalisation if countries work together: Ong Ye Kung|date=4 June 2017|accessdate=20 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nCertain countries, predominantly but not exclusively in western Europe and the Americas, issue [[working holiday visa]]s for younger visitors to supplement their travel funds by working minor jobs.

Similar policies are in force in other countries with significant religious sites.\n\nCertain jurisdictions impose special visa requirements on [[journalism|journalists]] in order to curtail the freedom of foreign reporters and news organisations to report on controversial topics.

If not successful, Indian travellers may apply for a visa instead. Taiwanese people are eligible only if they were born in Taiwan or entered Hong Kong as an ROC nationals before, otherwise they should instead apply for an entry permit (a de facto visa) to enter Hong Kong using their [[Republic of China passport]]. They may alternatively enter Hong Kong using a [[Mainland Travel Permit for Taiwan Residents]] issued by Mainland Chinese authorities without any additional permit.\n\n====North America====\n{{main|Electronic System for Travel Authorization|Electronic Travel Authorization (Canada)}}\nEast of the Pacific, both America and Canada have introduced electronic travel authorisations. Travellers from visa-free countries entering Canada by air, except [[United States nationality law|American nationals]] (including those with and without full citizenship), must obtain an Electronic Travel Authorisation prior to arrival but not if arriving by land or sea. Travellers under the American [[Visa Waiver Program]]me are required to obtain permission through the Electronic System for Travel Authorisation if arriving America by air or cruise but not if entering by land or by ferry, using a passport issued by the Government of Bermuda to a [[British Overseas Territories Citizen]], or if entering as a Canadian citizen.\n\nTravellers from [[Brazil]] normally require a visa to enter Canada, but are eligible to apply for an ETA if they have held a Canadian visa within the 10 years prior to applying, or if they currently hold a valid non-immigrant American visa. Such travellers still may not enter Canada by land or sea without a valid Canadian visa.\n\n===Exit controls===\n{{multiple image\n| footer    = India and China, like most countries, implement border controls at both entry and exit, and consequently stamp passports upon exit\n| width     = 100\n| image1    = India passport entry stamp.jpg\n| alt1      = Indian entry stamp at New Deli [[Indira Gandhi International Airport]].\n| image2    = India passport stamp.jpg\n| alt2      = Indian exit stamp at Indira Gandhi International Airport.\n| image3    = China Visa Stamp.jpg\n| alt3      = Chinese entry and exit stamps at [[Shanghai Pudong International Airport]].\n}}\n[[File:Queenston Bridge Canada Passport Bridge.JPG|thumb|130px|Entry stamp at [[Lewiston\u2013Queenston Bridge]], Ontario. Canada only conducts border control and stamps passports upon entry.]]\n\nWhilst most countries implement border controls both at entry and at exit, some jurisdictions do not. For instance, USA and Canada do not implement exit controls at land borders and collect exit data on foreign nationals through airlines and through information sharing with neighbouring countries\u2019 entry border controls. These countries consequently don't issue exit stamps even to travellers who require stamps on entry. Similarly, Australia, Singapore and South Korea have eliminated exit stamps even though they continue to implement brief border control checks upon exit for most foreign nationals.\n\n====Exit visas====\nSome countries in Europe maintain controversial exit visa systems in addition to regular border controls. For instance, Uzbekistan requires its own citizens to obtain exit visas prior to leaving for countries other than [[Commonwealth of Independent States|fellow CIS]] nations in eastern Europe. Several [[Gulf Cooperation Council|countries in the Arabian peninsula]] require exit visas for foreign workers under the [[Kafala System]] meaning \"sponsorship system\"). Russia occasionally requires foreigners who overstay to obtain [[Visa policy of Russia#Exit|exit visas]] since one cannot exit Russia without a valid visa. Czechia has a similar policy.<ref>[http://www.sagit.cz/_texty/sb99326.htm Act on the status of aliens in Czech Republic], \u00a720</ref>  Similarly, a foreign citizen granted a temporary residence permit in Russia needs an exit visa to take a trip abroad (valid for both exit and return). Not all foreign citizens are subject to that requirement. Citizens of Germany, for example, do not require this exit visa.\n\nCertain Asian countries have policies that similarly require certain categories of citizens to seek official authorisation prior to travelling or emigrating. This is usually either as a way to enforce [[conscription|national service]] obligations or to protect migrant workers from travelling to places where they may be abused by employers. Singapore, for instance, operates an Exit Permit scheme in order to enforce the [[National service in Singapore|national service]] obligations of its male citizens and permanent residents.<ref>{{cite act |title= Enlistment Act|type= |number= 25|language= |date= 1970|article= 32|articletype= s.|page= |url= http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/aol/search/display/view.w3p;orderBy=date-rev,loadTime;page=0;query=DocId%3A%227c7b1aab-8403-4443-b322-0cba08be5d45%22%20Status%3Ainforce%20Depth%3A0%20ValidTime%3A20161111000000%20TransactionTime%3A20161111000000;rec=0}}</ref> These restrictions vary according to age and status.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.ecitizen.gov.sg/Topics/Pages/National-Service-Exit-permit-requirements.aspx|title= National Service: Exit permit requirements|author= <!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|date= |website= ecitizen.gov.sg|access-date= 2018-08-08|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170108045359/http://www.ecitizen.gov.sg/Topics/Pages/National-Service-Exit-permit-requirements.aspx|archive-date= 2017-01-08|url-status= dead}}</ref> [[South Korea]] and [[Taiwan]] <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ris.gov.tw/departure/app/|title=\u5167\u653f\u90e8\u5f79\u653f\u7f72\u5f79\u7537\u7dda\u4e0a\u7533\u8acb\u77ed\u671f\u51fa\u5883|website=www.ris.gov.tw}}</ref> have similar policies. [[India]], on the other hand, requires citizens who have not met certain educational requirements (and thus may be targeted by human traffickers or be coerced into [[modern slavery]]) to apply for approval prior to leaving the country and endorses their passports with [[Emigration Act, 1983|\u201dEmigration Check Required\u201d]]. [[Nepal]] similarly requires citizens emigrating to [[the United States]] on an [[H-1B visa]] to present an exit permit issued by the Ministry of Labour. This document is called a work permit and needs to be presented to immigration to leave the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dol.gov.np/|title=Department of Labour \u2013 Government Of Nepal|publisher=}}</ref> In a bid to increase protection for the large amount of Indian, Bangladeshi, Chinese, and Nepali citizens smuggled through Indian airports to the [[Middle East]] as underpaid labourers, many Indian airline companies require travellers to obtain an \u2018OK to Board\u2019 confirmation sent directly from visa authorities in certain GCC countries directly to the airline and will bar anyone who has not obtained this endorsement from clearing exit immigration.\n\n===Nationality and travel history===\n[[File:Visa requirements for Taiwanese citizens (6).png|thumb|upright=3|center|Map illustrating extra border controls placed on [[National without household registration|Taiwan passport holders without household registration in Taiwan]].]]\nMany nations implement border controls restricting the entry of people of certain nationalities or who have visited certain countries.

ROC nationals without ID numbers do not, for instance, have access to the American [[Visa Waiver Program]]me, or to visa free access to the Schengen Area or Japan. Other countries, such as India which allows all Chinese nationals to apply for [[Visa policy of India|eVisas]], don't make such a distinction. Singapore imposes [[Visa policy of Singapore#Assessment Level II Countries|strict controls]] on stateless individuals and refugees, and reduces length of stay for British nationals without right of abode in the United Kingdom, but does not distinguish between ROC passports with and without national ID numbers.\n\nAs a result of tension over the [[Republic of Artsakh|Artsakh]] dispute, Azerbaijan currently forbids entry to Armenian citizens as well as to individuals with proof of travel to Artsakh.\n\n==Free travel areas==\nCertain neighbouring countries may agree to fully or partially abolish border controls between them.\n\n===Central America-4 Border Control Agreement===\n{{main|Central America-4 Border Control Agreement}}\nThe Central America-4 Border Control Agreement abolishes border controls for land travel between El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Guatemala. However, this does not apply to air travel.\n\n===Commonwealth of Independent States===\n{{main|Commonwealth of Independent States}}\n\nThe Commonwealth of Independent States, or CIS, is an organisation composed of former members of the Soviet Union, whose members eliminate many trade and visa related border controls.\n\n====Union State of Russia and Belarus====\n{{main|Union State of Russia and Belarus}}\n\nThe Union State of Russia and Belarus is a supranational union of Russia and Belarus (two CIS members), which eliminates all border controls between the two nations. However, each country continues to maintain its own visa policies, thus resulting in non-citizens of the two countries generally being barred from travelling directly between the two.\n\n===Western Europe===\n\n{{main|Schengen Area|Common Travel Area}}\nThe two most significant free travel areas in Western Europe are the Schengen area, in which very little if any border control is generally visible, and the Common Travel Area (CTA), which partially eliminates such controls for nationals of the United Kingdom and Ireland. Between countries in the [[Schengen Area]], and to an extent within the CTA on the British Isles, internal border control is often virtually unnoticeable, and often only performed by means of random car or train searches in the [[hinterland]], while controls at borders with non-member states may be rather strict.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:The Border on Killeen School Road - geograph.org.uk - 446719.jpg|Irish border at Killeen (within CTA) marked only by a metric speed sign, as the Republic of Ireland uses the metric system whilst British road signs use imperial units\nFile:Northern Ireland border crossing sign 60mph.JPG|Sign often found at crossings from the Republic of Ireland into the North.\nImage:Grenzuebergang D-NL Elmpt-Grenze.JL.jpg|Open Schengen Area border crossing between Germany and the Netherlands\nFile:Panoramio - V&A Dudush - Avenue Princesse Grace (1).jpg|Open Schengen Area border crossing at the France-Monaco border\nFile:\u0412\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438 \u041a\u043d\u044f\u0436\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u041b\u0438\u0445\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0448\u0442\u0435\u0439\u043d - panoramio.jpg|Open Schengen Area border crossing at the Swiss-Lichtenstein border\n</gallery>\n\n===Greater India===\n[[File:Visa policy of Bhutan.png|400px|thumb|Visa policy of Bhutan, showing free movement arrangement between India and Bhutan]]\n{{main|1950 Indo-Nepal Treaty of Peace and Friendship|Visa policy of Bhutan}}\n\nIndia and Nepal maintain a similar arrangement to the CTA and the Union State of Russia and Belarus. Indians and Nepalis aren't subject to any migration controls in each other\u2019s countries and there are few controls on land travel by citizens across the border.\n\nIndia and Bhutan also have a similar system. The border between Jaigaon, in the Indian state of West Bengal, and the city of Phuentsholing is essentially open, and although there are internal checkpoints, Indians are allowed to proceed throughout Bhutan with a voter\u2019s ID or an identity slip from the Indian consulate in Phuentsholing. Similarly, Bhutanese passport holders enjoy free movement in India.\n\nWhilst not as liberal as the policies concerning the Indo-Nepalese and Indo-Bhutanese borders, Thailand and Cambodia have begun issuing combined visas to certain categories of tourists applying at specific Thai or Cambodian embassies and consulates in order to enable freer border crossings between the two countries.<ref>[http://www.nationmultimedia.com/national/Single-entry-visa-for-Thailand-Cambodia-30196863.html]</ref> The policy is currently in force for nationals of America and several European (primarily EU and GCC) and Oceanian countries as well as for Indian and Chinese nationals residing in Singapore.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.thaiembassy.sg/announcements/acmecs-single-visa-application-now-opens-for-citizen-of-35-countries-wishing-to-enter-0 |title = ACMECS Single Visa application now opens for citizen of 35 countries wishing to enter Thailand and Cambodia for tourism purposes &#124; Royal Thai Embassy}}</ref>\n\n===Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement===\n[[File:New Zealand Resident Visa Stamp on Australian Travel Document.jpg|130px|thumbnail|A New Zealand visa stamp issued under Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement on an Australian travel document.]]\nThe [[Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement]] is not a free travel area. However, citizens and Australian permanent residents receive free indefinite visas with work rights at immigration control points in airports and sea ports.\n\nThe arrangement came into effect in 1973, and allows citizens of each country to reside and work in the other country, with some restrictions. Other details of the arrangement have varied over time. From 1 July 1981, all people entering Australia (including New Zealand citizens) have been required to carry a passport. Since 1 September 1994 Australia has had a universal visa requirement, and to specifically cater for the continued free movement of New Zealanders to Australia the [[Special Category Visa]] was introduced for New Zealanders.\n\n===Gulf Cooperation Council===\nMembers of the [[Gulf Cooperation Council]], or GCC, allow each other's citizens freedom of movement in an arrangement similar to the CTA and to that between India and Nepal.

The system can currently only be used by travellers 12 years of age or older, however a trial is under way that may potentially lower the age of eligibility to use eGate for people with an eligible ePassport from 12 years of age to 10 years of age. New Zealand eGates utilise biometric technology, comparing the picture of your face in your ePassport with the picture it takes of you at the gate in order to confirm your identity. To make sure eGate can do this, travellers must make sure they look as similar to their ePassport photos as possible and remove glasses, scarves and hats that they were not wearing when their passport picture was taken. eGate can handle minor changes in your face, for example if the travellers' weight or hair has changed. Customs, Biosecurity and Immigration officials utilise information provided at eGates, including photos, to clear travellers and their items across New Zealand's border. Biometric information is kept for three months before destruction but other information, including about movements across New Zealand's border is kept indefinitely and handled in accordance with the [[Right to privacy in New Zealand#Privacy Act 1993|Privacy Act 1993]], or as the law authorises. This might include information being used by or shared with other law enforcement or border control authorities.\n\nFrom 1 July 2019 visitors from the 60 Visa Waiver countries will require a New Zealand electronic Travel Authority (NZeTA).

It provides visa exemptions and access to expedited border control facilities. ABTC holders are eligible for expedited border control at Canadian airports but not for any visa exemptions.\n\nABTCs are generally issued only to citizens of APEC member countries, however Hong Kong issues them to Permanent Residents who are not Chinese citizens, a category primarily consisting of British, Indian, and Pakistani citizens.\n\nThe use of ABTCs in China is restricted as a result of the [[One Country, Two Systems]] and [[One China Policy|One China]] policies. [[Taiwanese nationality law|Taiwanese nationals]], and [[Chinese nationality law|Chinese citizens]] from [[Hong Kong residents|Hong Kong]], and [[Macau Resident Identity Card|Macau]] are required to use special internal travel documents to enter [[China|the mainland]]. Similar restrictions exist on the use of ABTC for Chinese citizens of other regions entering [[Taiwan]]. (see: [[Border control#Internal border controls|Internal border controls]]).\n\n==Internal border controls==\n\n===Asia===\n\nSome countries maintain border controls within their own territory. These are not uncommon in some parts of Asia. For example, minority regions in India and China often require special permits (i.e. [[Foreigners (Protected Areas) Order 1958 (India)|Restricted Area Permits, Protected Area Permits]], [[Visa policy of China#Tibet Autonomous Region|Tibet Travel Permits, or Alien Travel Permits]]) for foreign nationals to enter in addition to visas where required. In some cases, these restrictions are not limited to foreigners. For instance, certain minority areas of India additionally require Indian citizens to possess an [[Inner Line Permit]] to enter. Similarly, the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] ([[Classical Tibetan|Tibetan]]: \u0f56\u0f7c\u0f51\u0f0b\u0f62\u0f44\u0f0b\u0f66\u0f90\u0fb1\u0f7c\u0f44\u0f0b\u0f63\u0f97\u0f7c\u0f44\u0f66\u0f0d) in China exempts Chinese citizens from the Mainland, Hong Kong, and Macau to obtain TTPs and ATPs {{citation needed|date=October 2019}}. [[Taiwanese nationality law|Taiwanese people]] are required to obtain those permits even though, in the PRC, nationals of the ROC are commonly known as \"Taiwanese compatriots\" in news articles and for legislation purposes, '''\"Chinese citizens residing in Taiwan\"'''.<ref>Article 2 of the {{cite web|title=Measures for the Administration of Chinese Citizens Travelling to or from Taiwan Region|url =http://en.pkulaw.cn/display.aspx?cgid=250073&lib=law |publisher=Peking University Center for Legal Information }}</ref>\n\nInternal air and rail travel within non-autonomous portions of India and mainland China also generally requires travel documents to be checked by government officials as a form of interior border checkpoint. For such travel within India, Indian citizens may utilise their [[Voter ID (India)|Voter ID]], [[Aadhaar|National Identity Card]], passport, or other proof of Indian citizenship whilst Nepali nationals may present any similar proof of Napali citizenship. Meanwhile, for such travel within mainland China, Chinese nationals from the mainland are required to use their national identity cards.\n\nWithin China, extensive border controls are maintained for those travelling between the [[Mainland China|mainland]], [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|special administrative regions]] of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], and [[Free area of the Republic of China|areas controlled by the Republic of China]].{{efn|name=ROC|The area under the definition consists of the island groups of [[Geography of Taiwan|Taiwan]], [[Penghu]] (the Pescadores), [[Kinmen]] (Quemoy), [[Matsu Islands]] and [[List of islands of Taiwan|other islands]].}} Foreign nationals need to present their passports or other types of travel documents when travelling between these areas. For Chinese nationals (including those with [[British National (Overseas)]] status), there are special [[travel document|documents]]{{efn|For example, [[Hong Kong Permanent Identity Card]] or [[Macau Identity Card]] and [[Home Return Permit]] are required for Hong Kong or Macau Permanent Residents who are Chinese citizens to cross the border, whilst mainlanders require a two-way permit.}} for travel between these territories. Similar arrangements, in the form of the [[Mainland Travel Permit for Taiwan Residents]] issued by mainland authority and [[Exit & Entry Permit|similar permits]] issued by Taiwan authorities exist for travel between Taiwan and territories controlled by the [[People\u2019s Republic of China]]. Internal border controls in the Chinese Special Administrative Regions have also meant that immigrants from the mainland require a [[People's Republic of China Permit for Proceeding to Hong Kong and Macao|One Way Travel Permit]], the issuance of which is controlled by the mainland government, thus giving that region of China greater control over emigration rather than by Hong Kong or Macau as would be expected of border controls aimed at curtailing immigration.\n\nAnother example is the [[Malaysia]]n states of [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]], which have maintained their own border controls<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.lonelyplanet.com/borneo/visas |title = Visas and customs in Borneo}}</ref> since joining Malaysia in 1963. The internal border control is asymmetrical; while Sabah and Sarawak impose immigration control on Malaysian citizens from other states, there is no corresponding border control in [[Peninsular Malaysia]], and Malaysians from Sabah and Sarawak have unrestricted right to live and work in the Peninsular. For social and business visits less than three months, Malaysian citizens may travel between the Peninsular, Sabah and Sarawak using the [[Malaysian identity card]] (MyKad) or [[Malaysian passport]], while for longer stays in Sabah and Sarawak they are required to have an Internal Travel Document or a passport with the appropriate residential permit.\n\nMeanwhile, in Bhutan, a microstate accessible by road only through India, there are interior border checkposts (primarily on the [[Lateral Road]]) and, additionally, certain areas require [[Visa policy of Bhutan#Restricted areas permit|special permits]] to enter, whilst visitors not proceeding beyond the border city of [[Phuentsholing]] do not need permits to enter for the day (although such visitors are [[de facto]] subject to Indian visa policy since they must proceed through [[Jaigaon]]). Individuals who are not citizens of India, Bangladesh, or the Maldives are not allowed to proceed past Phuentsholing by land and are instead required to arrive by air at the country's [[Paro Airport|sole international airport]] in [[Paro, Bhutan|Paro]], which has flights from India and other countries in the Greater India region such as Thailand, Singapore, and Nepal.\n\nThe most restrictive internal border controls are in [[North Korea]]. Citizens are not allowed to travel outside their areas of residence without explicit authorisation, and access to the capital city of Pyongyang is heavily restricted.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country%2C%2C%2C%2CPRK%2C4562d8cf2%2C487ca236c0%2C0.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018022844/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country%2C%2C%2C%2CPRK%2C4562d8cf2%2C487ca236c0%2C0.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=2012-10-18 |title = UNHCR &#124; Refworld &#124; Freedom in the World 2008 - North Korea}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/ASA24/002/2009/en/ | title=Document}}</ref> Similar restrictions are imposed on tourists, who are only allowed to leave Pyongyang on government-authorised tours to approved tourist sites.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:RAP Immigration Stamp.JPG|Domestic Immigration stamp permitting entry into the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in India.\nFile:Republic of China Multiple Exit and Entry Permit (China Mainland Citizen).jpg|Data page of a booklet type [[Exit & Entry Permit|internal travel document]] issued by Taiwan authorities to a Mainland Chinese resident.\nFile:AadhaarCard.jpg|A sample of the Indian national identity card (variant with Tamil as a regional language and English as the federal language), one of the documents that may be used to clear domestic controls at airports.

Other examples of effective internal border controls in Europe include the [[closed cities]] of certain [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] members, [[Visa policy of Turkmenistan#Special permits|areas of Turkmenistan]] that require special permits to enter, [[Visa policy of Tajikistan#Gorno-Badakhshan|restrictions]] on travel to the [[Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region]] in Tajikistan, and (depending on whether Northern and Southern Cyprus are considered separate countries) the Cypriot border. Similarly, Iraq's [[Iraqi Kurdistan|Kurdistan region]] maintains a separate and more liberal visa and customs area from the rest of the country, even allowing [[Visa policy of Iraq|visa free entry]] for Israelis whilst the rest of the country bans them from entering. [[Denmark]] also maintains a complex system of subnational countries with autonomous customs policies, since they aren't within the European Union like the Danish mainland. These are [[Greenland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]]. These areas do not maintain strict immigration controls with the Schengen Area, but border controls are sporadically enforced for customs purposes.\n\nIn addition to the numerous closed cities of Russia,<ref>{{cite web|title=Russian Federation Country Specific Information \u2013 Entry/Exit Requirements for U.S. Citizens|url=http://www.travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1006.html#entry_requirements|publisher=Bureau of Consular Affairs, U.S. Department of State|accessdate=18 November 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203003453/http://www.travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1006.html#entry_requirements|archivedate=3 December 2013}}</ref> parts of 19 subjects{{efn|\n* 1.

Spread throughout the [[Israel|State of Israel]] and the areas of the [[State of Palestine]] under de facto Israeli control, internal checkpoints are a key feature of Israeli and Palestinian life, and Israel\u2019s internal border controls are amongst the most restrictive in the world.\n\nAn unusual example of internal border controls pertains to customs enforcement within the Schengen area. Even though borders are generally invisible, the existence of areas within the Schengen area but outside the [[European Union Value Added Tax Area]], as well as jurisdictions such as Andorra which are not officially a part of the Schengen area but can not be accessed without passing through it, has resulted in the existence of sporadic [[Schengen Area#Internal controls|internal border controls]] for customs purposes. Additionally, as per Schengen area rules,<ref>[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/;jsessionid=TJcLTTkLTbF0zDNTTm0Z2GGMzHlM1QGpWP9mdKGRx6WlrfTlb2GQ!1620842458?uri=CELEX:32006R0562 Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 March 2006 establishing a Community Code on the rules governing the movement of persons across borders (Schengen Borders Code)] See Title III Article 21</ref> hotels and other types of commercial accommodation must register all foreign citizens, including citizens of other Schengen states, by requiring the completion of a registration form by their own hand.

A Schengen state is also permitted to reinstate border controls with another Schengen country for a short period where there is a serious threat to that state's \"public policy or internal security\" or when the \"control of an external border is no longer ensured due to exceptional circumstances\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20120608-european-union-schengen-border-control-migrants-refugees |title=EU agrees short-term border closures to block migrants |date=8 June 2012 |accessdate=8 August 2012}}</ref> When such risks arise out of foreseeable events, the state in question must notify the European Commission in advance and consult with other Schengen states.<ref>Chapter II of the Schengen Borders Code ([http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32006R0562:EN:NOT OJ L 105, 13 April 2006, p. 1]).</ref> In April 2010 Malta introduced temporary checks due to [[Pope Benedict XVI]]'s visit.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20100405/local/border-checks-are-back |title=Border checks are back |newspaper=Times of Malta |date=5 April 2010 |accessdate=9 May 2010}}</ref> It reimposed checks in 2015 in the weeks surrounding the [[CHOGM 2015|Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting]].

Whilst the [[crown dependencies]] are within the [[Common Travel Area]], neither [[Gibraltar]] nor the sovereign British military exclaves of [[Akrotiri and Dhekelia]] are. The former maintains its own [[Visa policies of British Overseas Territories#Gibraltar|border control policies]], thus requiring physical border security at its border with the Schengen Area as well as the implementation of border controls for travellers proceeding directly between Gibraltar and the British mainland. The latter maintains a relatively open border with Southern Cyprus, though not with Northern Cyprus. Consequently, it is a de facto member of the Schengen Area and travel to or from the British mainland requires border controls.\n\nThe [[Peace lines|Peace Lines]] in Northern Ireland are a de facto internal border security measure to separate Catholic/Republican communities and Protestant/Unionist communities from each other. They have been in place in some form or another since the end of [[The Troubles]].\n\n<gallery>\n\nFile:RamallahCheckpoint.JPG|Israeli checkpoint outside the Palestinian city of [[Ramallah]].

These include the maintenance of [[Visa policy of the United States#Visa waiver programs of Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands|autonomous]] or [[Visa policy of the United States#American Samoa|separate immigration policies]] in each of America\u2019s major territories in the Pacific, i.e. [[Guam]], [[American Samoa]], and the [[Northern Mariana Islands]]. Each of these territories maintains its own visa exemptions, and there are consequently immigration and customs checks on travel between the these territories and the American mainland.\n\nThe US Virgin Islands are a special case, falling within America\u2019s immigration zone but being a customs free territory. As a result, there are no immigration checks between the two but there travellers arriving in Puerto Rico or the American mainland directly from the Virgin Islands are subject to border control for customs inspection. America also maintains [[United States Border Patrol interior checkpoints|interior checkpoints]], similar to those maintained by Bhutan, along its borders with Mexico and Canada, subjecting people to border controls even after they have entered the country. The city of [[Hyder, Alaska]] has also been subject to internal border controls since the United States chose to stop regulating arrivals in Hyder from British Columbia. Since travellers exiting Hyder into British Columbia are subject to Canadian border controls, it is theoretically possible for someone to accidentally enter Hyder from Canada without their travel documents and then to face difficulties since both America and Canada would subject them to border controls that require travel documents.\n\n===Realm of New Zealand===\n[[File:Niue passport stamp (entry).png|right|150px|thumbnail|Niue entry stamp issued at [[Hanan International Airport]]]]\n{{main|Visa policy of New Zealand}}\n{{further|Realm of New Zealand}}\n\n[[Tokelau]], [[Niue]], and the [[Cook Islands]] ([[Cook Islands M\u0101ori]]: ''K\u016bki '\u0100irani'')<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=AT2ENAHoS28C ''Cook Islands Maori dictionary''] by Jasper Buse & Raututi Taringa, Cook Islands Ministry of Education (1995) page 200</ref> maintain independent and less restrictive border controls from New Zealand. The [[Cook Islands]] further maintain a separate nationality law. Additionally, border controls for Tokelau are complicated by the fact that the territory is, for the most part, only accessible via [[Samoa]].\n\n==Prescreening border controls==\n===America===\n{{main|United States border preclearance}}\n\nThe [[Federal government of the United States|American government]] operates border preclearance facilities at a number of ports and airports in foreign territory.  They are staffed and operated by [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] officers. Travelers pass through U.S. [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement|Immigration and Customs]], [[United States Public Health Service|Public Health]], and [[United States Department of Agriculture|Agriculture]] inspections before boarding their aircraft, ship, or train.  This process is intended to streamline border procedures, reduce congestion at ports of entry, and facilitate travel between the preclearance location and U.S. airports unequipped to handle international travellers.\n\nThese facilities are present at the majority of major Canadian airports, as well as selected airports in Bermuda, Aruba, the Bahamas, Abu Dhabi<ref>{{cite news |url = http://ph.news.yahoo.com/us-customs-pre-clearance-facility-opens-uae-162934663--sector.html |title = US Customs pre-clearance facility opens in UAE |work = Yahoo!

Normally they are performed and organised by private companies, based on a law that they have to check that passengers don't travel into a specific country if they aren't allowed to. Such controls can take effect in one country based on the law of another country without any formalised border control prescreening agreement in force. Even if they aren't border controls they function as such. The most prominent example is airlines which check passports and visa before passengers are allowed to board the aircraft. Also for some passenger boats such check are performed before boarding.\n\n==Border control organisations==\n{{further|Border guard}}\nBorder controls are usually the responsibility of specialised government organisations. Such agencies may oversee various aspects of border control, such as [[Customs (tax)|customs]], immigration policy, border security, [[quarantine]], and other such aspects. Official designations, jurisdictions and command structures of these agencies vary considerably, and some countries split border control functions across multiple agencies.\n\n===India===\n====Border Security Force====\n[[File:BSF Logo.svg|167px|thumb|Insignia of the Border Security Force]]\n{{main|Border Security Force}}\n\nThe Border Security Force, or BSF, is the primary border defence organisation of India.

The agency acts as a [[coast guard]], [[border guard]], sea [[rescue]] organisation and a [[customs]] service.<ref>[http://www.douane.gouv.fr/page.asp?id=141 Missions of the DGDDI]</ref> In addition, since 1995, the agency has replaced the [[Direction centrale de la police aux fronti\u00e8res|Border Police]] in carrying out [[immigration]] control at smaller [[border checkpoint]]s, in particular at maritime borders and regional airports.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/doc_centre/borders/docs/customs_bgs_final.pdf |title=Center for the Study of Democracy: Study to identify best practices on the cooperation between border guards and customs administrations working at the external borders of the EU |access-date=2018-08-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304110123/http://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/doc_centre/borders/docs/customs_bgs_final.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n====Finnish Border Guard====\nThe [[Finnish Border Guard]], including the [[coast guard]], is the agency responsible for border control related to persons, including passport control and border patrol. The Border Guard is a paramilitary organization, subordinate to the Ministry of the Interior in administrative issues and to the President of the Republic in issues pertaining to the president's authority as Commander-in-Chief (e.g. officer promotions). The [[Finland-Russia border]] is a controlled external border of the Schengen Area, routinely patrolled and protected by a [[Border control#Border zones|border zone]] enforced by the Border Guard. Finland's borders with Norway and Sweden are internal Schengen borders with no routine border controls, but the Border Guard maintains personnel in the area owing to its search and rescue (SAR) duties. There are two coast guard districts for patrolling maritime borders. In peacetime, the Border Guard trains [[special forces]] and [[light infantry]] and can be incorporated fully or in part into the [[Finnish Defence Forces]] when required by defence readiness. The Border Guard has police and investigative powers in immigration matters and can independently investigate immigration violations. The Border Guard has search and rescue (SAR) duties, both maritime and inland. The Guard operates SAR helicopters that are often used in inland SAR, in assistance of a local fire and rescue department or other authorities. The Border Guard shares border control duties with Finnish Customs, which inspects arriving goods, and the [[Finnish Police]], which enforces immigration decisions such as removal.\n\n====Swedish border police====\nThe border control is handled by a special group in the police force. Sweden has natural land borders only to Norway and Finland, where there are no border controls, so border surveillance is not done there apart from customs control. Therefore, border control is focused on some fixed control points, during the border control-less Schengen period until 2015 mainly airports. The [[Schengen Area#Temporary border controls|introduction of full border control]] from Denmark and the continent in 2015 put a heavy load on the border police who had to check 8000 cars and 50 trains per day coming over the [[\u00d6resund Bridge]], and 3000 cars in [[Helsingborg]] and more in other ferry ports. The police quickly educated several hundred semi-authorised border control guards who had to ask the real officers to take over any doubtful case. The customs office and the coast guard can not do formal border controls, but can stop people in doubtful cases and ask police to take over.\n\n===China===\n====Hong Kong====\n{{main|Immigration Department (Hong Kong)}}\n\nThe Immigration Department of Hong Kong is responsible for border controls of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Regions, including [[Border control#Internal border controls|internal controls]] with the rest of China. After the People's Republic of China resumed sovereignty of the territory in July 1997, Hong Kong's immigration system remained largely unchanged from its British predecessor model. In addition, [[Visa policy of Hong Kong|visa-free entry]] acceptance regulations into Hong Kong for passport holders of some 170 countries remain unchanged before and after 1997.\n\n====Macau====\nThe Immigration Department of Macau, under the [[Public Security Police Force of Macau|Public Security Police Force]], is the government agency responsible for immigration matters, whilst the Public Security Police Force itself is responsible for enforcing immigration laws in Macau.<ref>[http://www.fsm.gov.mo/psp/por/psp_top9_map_sm.html Servi\u00e7o de Migra\u00e7\u00e3o]</ref>\n\n====Mainland China====\nBorder security in [[Mainland China]] are the responsibility of National Immigration Administration of the People's Republic of China, formerly the Exit & Entry Administration<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.moj.gov.cn/news/content/2018-04/02/zfyw_17882.html|title=National Immigration Administration Listing Ceremony Held|last=|first=|date=|website=Ministry of Justice of the People's Republic of China|access-date=}}</ref>), a unit of [[Ministry of Public Security (China)|the Ministry of Public Security of the People's Republic of China]].

Strictly speaking, it is distinct from other matters such as [[naturalisation]] and [[citizenship]], although they are often conflated. Immigration laws vary around the world, as well as according to the [[Society|social]] and [[political climate]] of the times, as acceptance of immigrants sways from the widely inclusive to the deeply [[Nationalism|nationalist]] and [[Isolationism|isolationist]]. Countries frequently maintain laws which regulate both the rights of entry and exit as well as internal rights, such as the duration of stay, [[freedom of movement]], and the right to participate in commerce or government.\n\nNational laws regarding the immigration of citizens of that country are regulated by [[international law]]. The [[United Nations|United Nations']] [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] mandates<ref>art 12(4)</ref> that all countries allow entry to their own citizens.\n\n===Comparison of immigration visa categories by country or territory===\n<!-- Comment - TBD -->\nThis section is an attempt to classify and bring together information about immigration legislation on a number of countries with high immigration.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 90%; text-align: left;\"\n|-\n!

After hearing [[Aretha Franklin]]'s version of \"[[Respect (song)|Respect]]\", Whitfield rearranged \"Grapevine\" to include some of the [[funk]] elements of the [[Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section]]. According to [[David Ritz]], Whitfield set to record a song that would \"out-funk\" Aretha. After Whitfield presented the demo tapes, [[Gladys Knight]], [[Merald \"Bubba\" Knight|Bubba Knight]], [[William Guest (singer)|William Guest]], and [[Edward Patten]] worked for several weeks on their vocal arrangement. To make the song suitable for Gladys, the first line of the second verse (''\"I know a man ain't supposed to cry/But these tears I can't hold inside\"'') was altered to (''\"Take a good look at these tears in my eyes/Baby, these tears I can't hold inside\"''). After much talk, Gordy reluctantly allowed the Pips' version to be a single on September 28, 1967, on Motown's Soul label.\n\n==Releases==\nThe Gladys Knight & the Pips version released on September 28, 1967, was on Motown's Soul label, with \"It\u2019s Time to Go Now\" on the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]]. Motown put little support behind it and the Pips relied on connections with DJs across the United States to get the record played. The Pips' version of \"Grapevine\" reached number one on the ''Billboard'' R&B chart on November 25, 1967, and stayed there for six weeks, making it the group's second R&B number one after 1961's \"Every Beat of My Heart\". It reached two on the ''Billboard'' Pop Singles chart<ref>{{cite book|title= Top R&B/Hip-Hop Singles: 1942\u20132004 |author= [[Joel Whitburn]] |year= 2004 |publisher= Record Research |page=330}}</ref> the same month, with [[the Monkees]]' \"[[Daydream Believer]]\" holding top spot. It was Motown's best-selling single to that point. The song was later placed on the Gladys Knight & the Pips album ''[[Everybody Needs Love (Gladys Knight & the Pips album)|Everybody Needs Love]]''.\n\nWhitfield wanted Gordy to release Gaye's \"Grapevine\" as a single, but Gordy did not want to release another version after the Pips had already made a hit out of it.<ref name=Posner/> In September 1968, Whitfield added \"Grapevine\" to Gaye's new album ''[[I Heard It Through the Grapevine (album)|In the Groove]]''.<ref name=Posner/> On release \"Grapevine\" became a radio hit and, according to Gordy himself, \"The DJs played it so much off the album that we had to release it as a single\".<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=eg0dpgvfVqEC&pg=PA92#v=onepage&q&f=false |title= To Be Loved: The Music, the Magic, the Memories of Motown |author= [[Berry Gordy]] |page= 275 |publisher= [[Grand Central Pub.]] |date=  December 1, 1995 |accessdate= September 24, 2012}}</ref> So Gaye's version was released as a single on October 30, 1968.

After hearing [[Aretha Franklin]]'s version of \"[[Respect (song)|Respect]]\", Whitfield rearranged \"Grapevine\" to include some of the [[funk]] elements of the [[Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section]]. According to [[David Ritz]], Whitfield set to record a song that would \"out-funk\" Aretha. After Whitfield presented the demo tapes, [[Gladys Knight]], [[Merald \"Bubba\" Knight|Bubba Knight]], [[William Guest (singer)|William Guest]], and [[Edward Patten]] worked for several weeks on their vocal arrangement. To make the song suitable for Gladys, the first line of the second verse (''\"I know a man ain't supposed to cry/But these tears I can't hold inside\"'') was altered to (''\"Take a good look at these tears in my eyes/Baby, these tears I can't hold inside\"''). After much talk, Gordy reluctantly allowed the Pips' version to be a single on September 28, 1967, on Motown's Soul label.\n\n==Releases==\nThe Gladys Knight & the Pips version released on September 28, 1967, was on Motown's Soul label, with \"It\u2019s Time to Go Now\" on the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]]. Motown put little support behind it and the Pips relied on connections with DJs across the United States to get the record played. The Pips' version of \"Grapevine\" reached number one on the ''Billboard'' R&B chart on November 25, 1967, and stayed there for six weeks, making it the group's second R&B number one after 1961's \"Every Beat of My Heart\". It reached two on the ''Billboard'' Pop Singles chart<ref>{{cite book|title= Top R&B/Hip-Hop Singles: 1942\u20132004 |author= [[Joel Whitburn]] |year= 2004 |publisher= Record Research |page=330}}</ref> the same month, with [[the Monkees]]' \"[[Daydream Believer]]\" holding top spot. It was Motown's best-selling single to that point. The song was later placed on the Gladys Knight & the Pips album ''[[Everybody Needs Love (Gladys Knight & the Pips album)|Everybody Needs Love]]''.\n\nWhitfield wanted Gordy to release Gaye's \"Grapevine\" as a single, but Gordy did not want to release another version after the Pips had already made a hit out of it.<ref name=Posner/> In September 1968, Whitfield added \"Grapevine\" to Gaye's new album ''[[I Heard It Through the Grapevine (album)|In the Groove]]''.<ref name=Posner/> On release \"Grapevine\" became a radio hit and, according to Gordy himself, \"The DJs played it so much off the album that we had to release it as a single\".<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=eg0dpgvfVqEC&pg=PA92#v=onepage&q&f=false |title= To Be Loved: The Music, the Magic, the Memories of Motown |author= [[Berry Gordy]] |page= 275 |publisher= [[Grand Central Pub.]] |date=  December 1, 1995 |accessdate= September 24, 2012}}</ref> So Gaye's version was released as a single on October 30, 1968.

Because of the success of both versions, \"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\" was the first and last number one on the ''Billboard'' R&B chart in 1968: the Pips version was the first week of January, the Gaye version the last week of December.

The first television series, called ''Star Trek'' and now known as \"''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|The Original Series]]''{{-\"}}, debuted on September 8, 1966 and aired for three seasons on [[NBC]]. It followed the voyages of the [[Starship Enterprise|starship USS ''Enterprise'']] on its five-year mission, the purpose of which was \"to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before\". The USS ''Enterprise'' was a space exploration vessel built by the [[United Federation of Planets]] in the 23rd century. The [[Star Trek canon|''Star Trek'' canon]] includes the ''Original Series'', an animated series, six spin-off television series, the [[Star Trek (film series)|film franchise]], and further adaptations in several media.\n\nIn creating ''Star Trek'', Roddenberry was inspired by [[C. S. Forester]]'s [[Horatio Hornblower]] series of novels, [[Jonathan Swift]]{{'s}} ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'', and television [[Western (genre)|westerns]] such as ''[[Wagon Train]]''. These adventures continued in the 22-episode ''[[Star Trek: The Animated Series]]'' and six feature films. Six new television series were eventually produced: ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' follows the crew of a new starship ''Enterprise'' a century after the original series; ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' are set contemporaneously with the ''Next Generation'', and ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise|Enterprise]]'', set before the original series in the early days of human interstellar travel. The most recent ''Star Trek'' television series, ''[[Star Trek: Discovery]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: Picard]]'', [[streaming television|stream]] exclusively on digital platforms. The adventures of the ''Next Generation'' crew continued in four additional feature films. In 2009, the film franchise underwent a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] called the ''Kelvin'' Timeline. Three films were made in this alternate universe. An additional television series is in development, ''[[Star Trek: Lower Decks]]''. Appearing on CBS All Access, it is scheduled to debut in 2020.\n\n''Star Trek'' has been a [[cult following|cult phenomenon]] for decades.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/entertainment/2003769419_webpotter02.html|title=Like 'Star Wars' and 'Star Trek,' Potter is a modern phenomenon|last=Italie|first=Hillel|date=2007-07-02|work=[[The Seattle Times]]|access-date=2011-10-19|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628193551/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/entertainment/2003769419_webpotter02.html|archive-date=2011-06-28|agency=[[Associated Press]]}}</ref> Fans of the franchise are called \"[[Trekkie]]s\" or \"Trekkers\".

[[Paramount Pictures]] and Roddenberry began developing a new series, ''[[Star Trek: Phase II]]'', in May 1975 in response to the franchise's newfound popularity.

The film opened in North America on December 7, 1979, with mixed reviews from critics. The film earned $139 million worldwide, below expectations but enough for Paramount to create a sequel. The studio forced Roddenberry to relinquish creative control of future sequels.\n\nThe success of the sequel, ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]'', reversed the fortunes of the franchise. While the sequel grossed less than the first movie, ''The Wrath of Khan''{{'}}s lower production costs made it net more profit. Paramount produced six ''Star Trek'' feature films between 1979 and 1991.\n\nIn response to the popularity of ''Star Trek'' feature films, the franchise returned to television with ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' in 1987.

CBS owned the film brand while Paramount owned the film library and would continue the film franchise. Paramount was the first company to try to revive the franchise, which it hired a new creative team to reinvigorate in 2007. Writers [[Roberto Orci]] and [[Alex Kurtzman]] and producer [[J. J. Abrams]] had the freedom to reinvent the feel of the franchise.\n\nThe team created the franchise's eleventh film, ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'', releasing it in May 2009. The film featured a new cast portraying the crew of the original show. ''Star Trek'' was a prequel of the original series set in an [[Alternate history|alternate timeline]], later named the ''Kelvin'' Timeline.

The profit-sharing agreement for the series split proceeds between Norway, Desilu\u2014later [[Paramount Television (original)|Paramount Television]], William Shatner, and NBC. However, ''Star Trek'' lost money during its initial broadcast, and NBC did not expect to recoup its losses by selling the series into syndication, nor did Paramount.\n\nWith NBC's approval, Paramount offered its share of the series to Roddenberry sometime in 1970. However, Roddenberry could not raise the $150,000 ({{Inflation|US|150000|1970|fmt=eq}}) offered by the studio.<ref name=\"Davies\" /> Paramount would go on to license the series for the syndication market worldwide. NBC's remaining broadcast and distribution rights eventually returned to Paramount sometime before 1986, which coincided with the development of what would become ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation|The Next Generation]]''.\n\nIn 1967, Desilu was acquired by [[Gulf and Western Industries|Gulf+Western]]. The studio was reorganized as the [[Paramount Television (original)|television production division]] of [[Paramount Pictures]], which Gulf+Western had acquired in 1966. Gulf+Western sold its remaining industrial assets in 1989, renaming itself Paramount Communications.\n\nSometime before 1986, [[Sumner Redstone]] acquired a controlling stake of [[Viacom (1952\u20132006)|Viacom]] via his family's theater chain, [[National Amusements]]. Viacom was originally established in 1952 as a division of [[CBS]] responsible for syndicating the network's programming, then called CBS Films. In 1994, Viacom and Paramount Communications merged.<ref name=\"Davies\" /> Viacom then merged with its former parent, [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation|CBS Corporation]], in 1999.\n\n=== Split ownership (2005\u20132019) ===\nIn 2005, the Redstone family reorganized Viacom, spinning off the conglomerate's assets as two independent groups: the new [[Viacom (2005\u20132019)|Viacom]], and the new [[CBS Corporation]].

The first television series, called ''Star Trek'' and now known as \"''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|The Original Series]]''{{-\"}}, debuted on September 8, 1966 and aired for three seasons on [[NBC]]. It followed the voyages of the [[Starship Enterprise|starship USS ''Enterprise'']] on its five-year mission, the purpose of which was \"to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before\". The USS ''Enterprise'' was a space exploration vessel built by the [[United Federation of Planets]] in the 23rd century. The [[Star Trek canon|''Star Trek'' canon]] includes the ''Original Series'', an animated series, six spin-off television series, the [[Star Trek (film series)|film franchise]], and further adaptations in several media.\n\nIn creating ''Star Trek'', Roddenberry was inspired by [[C. S. Forester]]'s [[Horatio Hornblower]] series of novels, [[Jonathan Swift]]{{'s}} ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'', and television [[Western (genre)|westerns]] such as ''[[Wagon Train]]''. These adventures continued in the 22-episode ''[[Star Trek: The Animated Series]]'' and six feature films. Six new television series were eventually produced: ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' follows the crew of a new starship ''Enterprise'' a century after the original series; ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' are set contemporaneously with the ''Next Generation'', and ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise|Enterprise]]'', set before the original series in the early days of human interstellar travel. The most recent ''Star Trek'' television series, ''[[Star Trek: Discovery]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: Picard]]'', [[streaming television|stream]] exclusively on digital platforms. The adventures of the ''Next Generation'' crew continued in four additional feature films. In 2009, the film franchise underwent a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] called the ''Kelvin'' Timeline. Three films were made in this alternate universe. An additional television series is in development, ''[[Star Trek: Lower Decks]]''. Appearing on CBS All Access, it is scheduled to debut in 2020.\n\n''Star Trek'' has been a [[cult following|cult phenomenon]] for decades.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/entertainment/2003769419_webpotter02.html|title=Like 'Star Wars' and 'Star Trek,' Potter is a modern phenomenon|last=Italie|first=Hillel|date=2007-07-02|work=[[The Seattle Times]]|access-date=2011-10-19|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628193551/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/entertainment/2003769419_webpotter02.html|archive-date=2011-06-28|agency=[[Associated Press]]}}</ref> Fans of the franchise are called \"[[Trekkie]]s\" or \"Trekkers\".

CBS owned the film brand while Paramount owned the film library and would continue the film franchise. Paramount was the first company to try to revive the franchise, which it hired a new creative team to reinvigorate in 2007. Writers [[Roberto Orci]] and [[Alex Kurtzman]] and producer [[J. J. Abrams]] had the freedom to reinvent the feel of the franchise.\n\nThe team created the franchise's eleventh film, ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'', releasing it in May 2009. The film featured a new cast portraying the crew of the original show. ''Star Trek'' was a prequel of the original series set in an [[Alternate history|alternate timeline]], later named the ''Kelvin'' Timeline. This gave the film and sequels freedom from the need to conform to the franchise's canonical timeline. The eleventh ''Star Trek'' film's marketing campaign targeted non-fans, even stating in the film's advertisements that \"this is not your father's ''Star Trek''\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=103824300|title=Some Older 'Star Trek' Fans May Skip This Voyage|last=Adler|first=Margo|date=2009-05-06|website=[[NPR]]|access-date=2011-10-19}}</ref> It also would not interfere with CBS's franchise.\n\nThe film earned considerable critical and financial success, grossing (in inflation-adjusted dollars) more box office sales than any previous ''Star Trek'' film.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://airlockalpha.com/6469/star-trek-becomes-highest-grossing-franchise-film-html|title='Star Trek' Becomes Highest Grossing Franchise Film|last=Hinman|first=Michael|date=2009-06-23|website=[[Airlock Alpha]]|access-date=2011-10-19}}</ref> The plaudits include the franchise's first [[Academy Award]] (for [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|makeup]]).

Such conflict often arose from friction between \"by-the-book\" Starfleet crew and rebellious Maquis fugitives forced by circumstance to work together.

The profit-sharing agreement for the series split proceeds between Norway, Desilu\u2014later [[Paramount Television (original)|Paramount Television]], William Shatner, and NBC. However, ''Star Trek'' lost money during its initial broadcast, and NBC did not expect to recoup its losses by selling the series into syndication, nor did Paramount.\n\nWith NBC's approval, Paramount offered its share of the series to Roddenberry sometime in 1970. However, Roddenberry could not raise the $150,000 ({{Inflation|US|150000|1970|fmt=eq}}) offered by the studio.<ref name=\"Davies\" /> Paramount would go on to license the series for the syndication market worldwide. NBC's remaining broadcast and distribution rights eventually returned to Paramount sometime before 1986, which coincided with the development of what would become ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation|The Next Generation]]''.\n\nIn 1967, Desilu was acquired by [[Gulf and Western Industries|Gulf+Western]]. The studio was reorganized as the [[Paramount Television (original)|television production division]] of [[Paramount Pictures]], which Gulf+Western had acquired in 1966. Gulf+Western sold its remaining industrial assets in 1989, renaming itself Paramount Communications.\n\nSometime before 1986, [[Sumner Redstone]] acquired a controlling stake of [[Viacom (1952\u20132006)|Viacom]] via his family's theater chain, [[National Amusements]]. Viacom was originally established in 1952 as a division of [[CBS]] responsible for syndicating the network's programming, then called CBS Films. In 1994, Viacom and Paramount Communications merged.<ref name=\"Davies\" /> Viacom then merged with its former parent, [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation|CBS Corporation]], in 1999.\n\n=== Split ownership (2005\u20132019) ===\nIn 2005, the Redstone family reorganized Viacom, spinning off the conglomerate's assets as two independent groups: the new [[Viacom (2005\u20132019)|Viacom]], and the new [[CBS Corporation]]. National Amusements and the Redstone family retained approximately 80% ownership of both CBS and Viacom.<ref>{{Cite press release|title=National Amusements, Inc.
