Most frequently found in [[Tasmania]] and southeast mainland Australia, it is a member of the genus ''[[Myrmecia (ant)|Myrmecia]]'', subfamily [[Myrmeciinae]], and was formally described and named by British entomologist [[Frederick Smith (entomologist)|Frederick Smith]] in 1858. This species is known for its ability to jump long distances. These ants are large; [[Worker ant|workers]] and males are about the same size: {{convert|12|to|14|mm|in|abbr=on}} for workers, and {{convert|11|to|12|mm|in|abbr=on}} for males. The queen measures roughly {{convert|14|to|16|mm|in|abbr=on}} long and is similar in appearance to workers, whereas males are identifiable by their perceptibly smaller [[mandibles]].\n\nJack jumper ants are primarily active during the day and live in open habitats, nesting in bushland, woodlands, and dry open forests, surrounded by [[gravel]] and [[sand]]y [[soil]], which can be found in [[rural area]]s and are less common in [[urban areas]]. They prey on small insects and use their barbless [[sting (biology)|stinger]]s to kill other insects by injecting [[venom]]. Other ants and predatory invertebrates prey on the jack jumper ant. The average worker has a [[life expectancy]] over one year. Workers are [[gamergate]]s, allowing them to reproduce with [[Drone Ant|drones]], whether or not a queen is present in the colony. The ant is a part of the ''Myrmecia pilosula'' [[species complex]]; this ant and other members of the complex are known to have a single pair of chromosomes.\n\nTheir sting generally only causes a mild local reaction in humans; however, it is one of the few ant species that can be dangerous to humans, along with other ants in the genus ''Myrmecia''. The ant venom is particularly [[immunogenic]] for an insect venom; the venom causes about 90% of Australian ant [[allergy|allergies]]. In endemic areas, up to 3% of the human population has developed an allergy to the venom and about half of these allergic people can suffer from [[anaphylaxis|anaphylactic reactions]] (increased heart rate, falling [[blood pressure]], and other symptoms), which can lead to death on rare occasions. Between 1980 and 2000, four deaths were due to anaphylaxis from jack jumper stings, all of them in Tasmania. Individuals prone to severe allergic reactions caused by the ant's sting can be treated with [[allergen immunotherapy]] (desensitisation).

Most frequently found in [[Tasmania]] and southeast mainland Australia, it is a member of the genus ''[[Myrmecia (ant)|Myrmecia]]'', subfamily [[Myrmeciinae]], and was formally described and named by British entomologist [[Frederick Smith (entomologist)|Frederick Smith]] in 1858. This species is known for its ability to jump long distances. These ants are large; [[Worker ant|workers]] and males are about the same size: {{convert|12|to|14|mm|in|abbr=on}} for workers, and {{convert|11|to|12|mm|in|abbr=on}} for males. The queen measures roughly {{convert|14|to|16|mm|in|abbr=on}} long and is similar in appearance to workers, whereas males are identifiable by their perceptibly smaller [[mandibles]].\n\nJack jumper ants are primarily active during the day and live in open habitats, nesting in bushland, woodlands, and dry open forests, surrounded by [[gravel]] and [[sand]]y [[soil]], which can be found in [[rural area]]s and are less common in [[urban areas]]. They prey on small insects and use their barbless [[sting (biology)|stinger]]s to kill other insects by injecting [[venom]]. Other ants and predatory invertebrates prey on the jack jumper ant. The average worker has a [[life expectancy]] over one year. Workers are [[gamergate]]s, allowing them to reproduce with [[Drone Ant|drones]], whether or not a queen is present in the colony. The ant is a part of the ''Myrmecia pilosula'' [[species complex]]; this ant and other members of the complex are known to have a single pair of chromosomes.\n\nTheir sting generally only causes a mild local reaction in humans; however, it is one of the few ant species that can be dangerous to humans, along with other ants in the genus ''Myrmecia''. The ant venom is particularly [[immunogenic]] for an insect venom; the venom causes about 90% of Australian ant [[allergy|allergies]]. In endemic areas, up to 3% of the human population has developed an allergy to the venom and about half of these allergic people can suffer from [[anaphylaxis|anaphylactic reactions]] (increased heart rate, falling [[blood pressure]], and other symptoms), which can lead to death on rare occasions. Between 1980 and 2000, four deaths were due to anaphylaxis from jack jumper stings, all of them in Tasmania. Individuals prone to severe allergic reactions caused by the ant's sting can be treated with [[allergen immunotherapy]] (desensitisation).\n\n==Taxonomy and common names==\n[[File:Casent0902800 p 1 high.jpg|thumb|Original holotype specimen (abdomen missing) ''Ponera ruginoda''<ref>{{cite web|author1=AntWeb|title=Specimen: Casent0902800 ''Myrmecia pilosula''|url=http://www.antweb.org/specimen.do?name=casent0902800|publisher=The California Academy of Sciences|website=antweb.org|accessdate=12 February 2015}}</ref>]]\nThe [[Specific name (zoology)|specific name]] derives from the [[Latin language|Latin]] word ''pilosa'', meaning 'covered with soft hair'.<ref name=evans2008/><ref>{{cite book|last1=Atkinson|first1=Ann|last2=Moore|first2=Alison|title=Macquarie Australian encyclopedic dictionary.|date=2010|publisher=Macquarie Dictionary Publishers|location=Sydney|isbn=978-1-876429-83-6|oclc=433042647|page=914|edition=2nd}}</ref> The ant was first identified in 1858 by British entomologist Frederick Smith  in his ''Catalogue of hymenopterous insects in the collection of the British Museum part VI'', under the [[Binomial nomenclature|binomial name]] ''Myrmecia pilosula'' from specimens he collected in [[Hobart]] in [[Tasmania]].{{sfn|Smith|1858|p=146}}<ref name=myrpilo>{{cite web|author1=Department of the Environment|title=Species ''Myrmecia pilosula'' Smith, 1858|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/abrs/online-resources/fauna/afd/taxa/Myrmecia%20pilosula|publisher=Government of Australia|accessdate=18 August 2014|location=Canberra|work=Australian Biological Resources Study: Australian Faunal Directory|date=8 April 2014}}</ref> There, Smith described the specimens of a worker, queen, and male.{{sfn|Smith|1858|p=146}} The [[Type (biology)|type specimen]] is located in the [[British Museum]] in [[London]].<ref name=\"Clark1951\"/> In 1922, American entomologist [[William Morton Wheeler]] established the [[subgenus]] ''Halmamyrmecia'' characterised by its jumping behaviour, of which the jack jumper ant was designated as the [[type species]].<ref name=\"Wheeler1922\"/> However, [[John S.
