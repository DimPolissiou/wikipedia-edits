Hughes cites Lyons-Ruth & Jacobvitz (1999) in support of this theory. Caregivers are seen as a source of fear with the result that children endeavour to control their caregivers through manipulation, overcompliance, intimidation or role reversal in order to keep themselves safe. Such children may also suffer intrusive memories secondary to trauma and as a result may be reluctant or unwilling to participate in treatment. It is anticipated that such children will try to actively avoid the exposure involved in developing a therapeutic relationship and will resist being directed into areas of shame and trauma. Hughes proposes that an attachment based treatment may be more effective for such foster and adoptive children than traditional treatment and parenting interventions.<ref name=\"hughes2004\"/>\n\nIt is stated that once an infant's safety needs are met (by attachment) they become more able to focus on learning and responding to the social and emotional needs of caregivers. (Schore, 2003ab). Hughes posits that this 'affective attunement', described by Stern (1985) is crucial in the development of both a secure attachment as well as a positive, integrated sense of self. Attunement is a primarily a non-verbal mode of communication between infant and carer, and synchrony in the degree of arousal being expressed, as well as empathy for the child's internal experience. Hughes states \"Whether it is a motivational system separate from attachment as is suggested by Stern (2004), or a central aspect of a secure attachment dyad, it remains vital in the child's overall development.\"<ref name=\"hughes2004\"/>\n\nThe therapy attempts to replicate this or fill in the gaps in a maltreated child's experience.\n\n==Methods==\n\nFirstly the therapist becomes 'non-verbally attuned' with the child's affective state. The therapist then attempts to explore 'themes' with the child whilst remaining attuned. Whilst this is done, the therapist then 'co-regulates' (helps the child to manage) the child's emerging affective states with 'matched vitality affect', and develops secondary affective/mental representations of them which is co-constructed with the child for purposes of integration (the therapist tries to help the child gain a coherent narrative about their experiences and an awareness of the positive aspects of themselves). According to Hughes \"The therapist allows the subjective experience of the child to impact the therapist. The therapist can then truly enter into that experience and from there express her/his own subjective experience.  As the therapist holds both subjective experiences, the child experiences both.  As the child senses both, the child begins to integrate them and re-experience the event in a way that will facilitate its integration and resolution.\"<ref name=\"hughes2004\"/> In the anticipated frequent disruptions, due to the child's traumatic and shaming experiences, the therapist accepts and works with these and then 'repairs' the relationship.\n\nThe aim is for the child to be able to construct a new and coherent autobiography that enables the child to be in touch with their inner feelings. \"As the therapist gives expression to the child's subjective narrative, s/he is continuously integrating the child's nonverbal responsiveness to the dialogue, modifying it spontaneously in a manner congruent with the child's expressions. The dialogue is likely to have more emotional meaning for the child if the therapist, periodically, speaks for the child in the first person with the child's own words.\" (Hughes 2004 p18)<ref name=\"hughes2004\"/> The active presence of one of the child's primary caregivers is considered to greatly enhance psychological treatment. However Hughes considers that attachment based treatment can be undertaken with just the therapist.(Hughes 2004 p25)<ref name=\"hughes2004\"/>\n\n==Controversy==\nDDP has been criticised for the lack of a comprehensive manual or full case studies to provide details of the process. Its theoretical basis has also been questioned.<ref name=\"mercer2014\" /> Although non-verbal communication, communicative mismatch and repair, playful interactions and the relationship between the parents' attachment status and that of a toddler are all well documented and important for early healthy emotional development, Hughes and Becker-Weidman are described as making \"a real logical jump\" in assuming that the same events can be deliberately recapitulated in order to correct the emotional condition of an older child.<ref name=\"Pignotti & Mercer\">Pignotti, M., & Mercer, J.

The therapy must also involve a great deal of physical contact between the child and the therapist and parent.  During much of the most intense therapeutic work, the child is being touched or held by the therapist or parent.  His intense emotions are received, accepted, and integrated into the self.\"<ref name=\"Hughes 1997\">Daniel A. Hughes (1997).

Along with this, he offered some discussion of how he came to reconsider some of his own past attachment therapy practices.\"</ref>\n\nThe Kansas University/SRS ''Best Practices Report'' (2004) considered that dyadic developmental psychotherapy as described by Becker-Weidman, appeared to be somewhat different from that as described by Hughes. They state that in 2004 Becker-Weidman's claim that dyadic developmental psychotherapy was \"evidence based\" cited studies on [[Attachment therapy|holding therapy]] by Myeroff, Randolph and Levy from the Attachment Center at Evergreen.<ref name=\"Becker-Weidman/Kansas\">Becker-Weidmann, A.

Trowell emphasized the value of many of Hughes's ideas for clinical work, but she concluded that \"There is a need for caution. Experienced, well-trained clinicians can, with supervision, take these ideas forward into their clinical practice. But the ideas in [Hughes's 2004 paper] do not provide a sufficient basis for a treatment manual, and are not to be followed uncritically.\"\n\n==Evidence==\nTwo research reports by Becker-Weidman, the second being a four-year follow-up of the first, are the only empirical examination of dyadic developmental psychotherapy.<ref name=\"mercer2014\" /> They reported DDP to be an effective treatment for children with [[Complex post-traumatic stress disorder|complex trauma]] who met the [[DSM IV]] criteria for [[reactive attachment disorder]].<ref name=\"bw1\"/><ref name=\"bw3\"/> The first report concluded that children who received dyadic developmental psychotherapy had clinically and statistically significant improvements in their functioning as measured by the [[Child Behavior Checklist]], while the children in the control group showed no change one year after treatment ended.

This was compared to a \"usual care group\" of thirty subjects, who were treated elsewhere. The published reports on this work do not specify the nature of \"usual care\" or clarify why the \"usual care\" group, who were assessed at Becker-Weidman's clinic, did not have treatment there. Treatment consisted of an average of 23 sessions over eleven months.  The findings continued for an average of 1.1 years after treatment ended for children between the ages of six and fifteen years.  There were no changes in the usual care-group subjects, who were re-tested an average of 1.3 years after the evaluation was completed.\n\nIn the follow-up study the results from the original study were maintained an average of 3.9 years after treatment ended. There were no changes in the usual care-group subjects, who were re-tested an average of 3.3 years after the evaluation was completed.\n\nBecker-Weidman's first study was considered by the APSAC Taskforce in their November 2006 Reply to Letters following their main report on attachment therapy.<ref name=\"Chaffin Reply2\"/> The Taskforce had in their original report criticised Becker-Weidman for claiming an evidence base to his therapy, and indeed for claiming to be the only evidence based therapy, where the Taskforce considered no evidence base existed.<ref name=\"Chaffin et al.\"/> Becker-Weidman responded to this with an open letter citing his study.<ref name=\"Letter to the Editor\">Arthur Becker-Weidman | Letter to the Editor | Child Maltreat 2006 No 11 | p379 | \n</ref> The Taskforce examined the (2006) study, criticized the methodology and stated that although the study was an important first step towards learning the facts about DDP outcomes, it fell far short of the criteria that must be met before designating a treatment as evidence based.<ref name=\"Reply p3\">\"In our estimation, DDP still does not meet criteria as an evidence-based treatment, although the published findings do raise hopes that DDP may be promising. Examining the study, it shares many of the same limitations noted in the Task Force's evaluation of the Myeroff study (p. 85). For example, the study used a small convenience sample, participants were self-selected into treatment versus comparison conditions, the age range of participants was very broad (5-16), there was no direct statistical analysis of differential group change over time, outcome data were not collected by blind or impartial reporters, and the study utilized completer only rather than intent-to-treat methods. Of course, no study is without limitations; however, the fact remains that a single study with these sorts of major limitations, although a first step, is far short of the criteria that must be met before designating a treatment as evidence based. In general, we believe that designating a treatment as evidence based is a job for an independent treatment review panel (e.g., American Psychological Association, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration [SAMHSA], Office for Victims of Crime Task Force, Cochrane Collaborative, etc.) applying accepted and established scientific review criteria. None has listed DDP as meeting accepted criteria. Thus, it is our opinion that practitioners should not characterize or advertise DDP as an evidence-based practice at this time.\" Reply to Letters p3.</ref>\n\nBetween the Taskforce report and Reply to Letters, Craven & Lee (2006) undertook a literature review of 18 studies of interventions used for foster children and classified them under the controversial Saunders, Berliner, & Hanson (2004) system.<ref name= \"Craven\"/><ref name=\"Saunders 2004\">Saunders, B.E., Berliner, L., & Hanson, R.F.

(Schore, 2003ab). Hughes posits that this 'affective attunement', described by Stern (1985) is crucial in the development of both a secure attachment as well as a positive, integrated sense of self. Attunement is a primarily a non-verbal mode of communication between infant and carer, and synchrony in the degree of arousal being expressed, as well as empathy for the child's internal experience. Hughes states \"Whether it is a motivational system separate from attachment as is suggested by Stern (2004), or a central aspect of a secure attachment dyad, it remains vital in the child's overall development.\"<ref name=\"hughes2004\"/>\n\nThe therapy attempts to replicate this or fill in the gaps in a maltreated child's experience.\n\n==Methods==\n\nFirstly the therapist becomes 'non-verbally attuned' with the child's affective state. The therapist then attempts to explore 'themes' with the child whilst remaining attuned. Whilst this is done, the therapist then 'co-regulates' (helps the child to manage) the child's emerging affective states with 'matched vitality affect', and develops secondary affective/mental representations of them which is co-constructed with the child for purposes of integration (the therapist tries to help the child gain a coherent narrative about their experiences and an awareness of the positive aspects of themselves). According to Hughes \"The therapist allows the subjective experience of the child to impact the therapist. The therapist can then truly enter into that experience and from there express her/his own subjective experience.  As the therapist holds both subjective experiences, the child experiences both.  As the child senses both, the child begins to integrate them and re-experience the event in a way that will facilitate its integration and resolution.\"<ref name=\"hughes2004\"/> In the anticipated frequent disruptions, due to the child's traumatic and shaming experiences, the therapist accepts and works with these and then 'repairs' the relationship.\n\nThe aim is for the child to be able to construct a new and coherent autobiography that enables the child to be in touch with their inner feelings. \"As the therapist gives expression to the child's subjective narrative, s/he is continuously integrating the child's nonverbal responsiveness to the dialogue, modifying it spontaneously in a manner congruent with the child's expressions. The dialogue is likely to have more emotional meaning for the child if the therapist, periodically, speaks for the child in the first person with the child's own words.\" (Hughes 2004 p18)<ref name=\"hughes2004\"/> The active presence of one of the child's primary caregivers is considered to greatly enhance psychological treatment. However Hughes considers that attachment based treatment can be undertaken with just the therapist.(Hughes 2004 p25)<ref name=\"hughes2004\"/>\n\n==Controversy==\nDDP has been criticised for the lack of a comprehensive manual or full case studies to provide details of the process. Its theoretical basis has also been questioned.<ref name=\"mercer2014\" /> Although non-verbal communication, communicative mismatch and repair, playful interactions and the relationship between the parents' attachment status and that of a toddler are all well documented and important for early healthy emotional development, Hughes and Becker-Weidman are described as making \"a real logical jump\" in assuming that the same events can be deliberately recapitulated in order to correct the emotional condition of an older child.<ref name=\"Pignotti & Mercer\">Pignotti, M., & Mercer, J.

The therapy must also involve a great deal of physical contact between the child and the therapist and parent.  During much of the most intense therapeutic work, the child is being touched or held by the therapist or parent.  His intense emotions are received, accepted, and integrated into the self.\"<ref name=\"Hughes 1997\">Daniel A. Hughes (1997).

Along with this, he offered some discussion of how he came to reconsider some of his own past attachment therapy practices.\"</ref>\n\nThe Kansas University/SRS ''Best Practices Report'' (2004) considered that dyadic developmental psychotherapy as described by Becker-Weidman, appeared to be somewhat different from that as described by Hughes. They state that in 2004 Becker-Weidman's claim that dyadic developmental psychotherapy was \"evidence based\" cited studies on [[Attachment therapy|holding therapy]] by Myeroff, Randolph and Levy from the Attachment Center at Evergreen.<ref name=\"Becker-Weidman/Kansas\">Becker-Weidmann, A.

Trowell emphasized the value of many of Hughes's ideas for clinical work, but she concluded that \"There is a need for caution. Experienced, well-trained clinicians can, with supervision, take these ideas forward into their clinical practice. But the ideas in [Hughes's 2004 paper] do not provide a sufficient basis for a treatment manual, and are not to be followed uncritically.\"\n\n==Evidence==\nTwo research reports by Becker-Weidman, the second being a four-year follow-up of the first, are the only empirical examination of dyadic developmental psychotherapy.<ref name=\"mercer2014\" /> They reported DDP to be an effective treatment for children with [[Complex post-traumatic stress disorder|complex trauma]] who met the [[DSM IV]] criteria for [[reactive attachment disorder]].<ref name=\"bw1\"/><ref name=\"bw3\"/> The first report concluded that children who received dyadic developmental psychotherapy had clinically and statistically significant improvements in their functioning as measured by the [[Child Behavior Checklist]], while the children in the control group showed no change one year after treatment ended.

This was compared to a \"usual care group\" of thirty subjects, who were treated elsewhere. The published reports on this work do not specify the nature of \"usual care\" or clarify why the \"usual care\" group, who were assessed at Becker-Weidman's clinic, did not have treatment there. Treatment consisted of an average of 23 sessions over eleven months.  The findings continued for an average of 1.1 years after treatment ended for children between the ages of six and fifteen years.  There were no changes in the usual care-group subjects, who were re-tested an average of 1.3 years after the evaluation was completed.\n\nIn the follow-up study the results from the original study were maintained an average of 3.9 years after treatment ended. There were no changes in the usual care-group subjects, who were re-tested an average of 3.3 years after the evaluation was completed.\n\nBecker-Weidman's first study was considered by the APSAC Taskforce in their November 2006 Reply to Letters following their main report on attachment therapy.<ref name=\"Chaffin Reply2\"/> The Taskforce had in their original report criticised Becker-Weidman for claiming an evidence base to his therapy, and indeed for claiming to be the only evidence based therapy, where the Taskforce considered no evidence base existed.<ref name=\"Chaffin et al.\"/> Becker-Weidman responded to this with an open letter citing his study.<ref name=\"Letter to the Editor\">Arthur Becker-Weidman | Letter to the Editor | Child Maltreat 2006 No 11 | p379 | \n</ref> The Taskforce examined the (2006) study, criticized the methodology and stated that although the study was an important first step towards learning the facts about DDP outcomes, it fell far short of the criteria that must be met before designating a treatment as evidence based.<ref name=\"Reply p3\">\"In our estimation, DDP still does not meet criteria as an evidence-based treatment, although the published findings do raise hopes that DDP may be promising. Examining the study, it shares many of the same limitations noted in the Task Force's evaluation of the Myeroff study (p. 85). For example, the study used a small convenience sample, participants were self-selected into treatment versus comparison conditions, the age range of participants was very broad (5-16), there was no direct statistical analysis of differential group change over time, outcome data were not collected by blind or impartial reporters, and the study utilized completer only rather than intent-to-treat methods. Of course, no study is without limitations; however, the fact remains that a single study with these sorts of major limitations, although a first step, is far short of the criteria that must be met before designating a treatment as evidence based. In general, we believe that designating a treatment as evidence based is a job for an independent treatment review panel (e.g., American Psychological Association, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration [SAMHSA], Office for Victims of Crime Task Force, Cochrane Collaborative, etc.) applying accepted and established scientific review criteria. None has listed DDP as meeting accepted criteria. Thus, it is our opinion that practitioners should not characterize or advertise DDP as an evidence-based practice at this time.\" Reply to Letters p3.</ref>\n\nBetween the Taskforce report and Reply to Letters, Craven & Lee (2006) undertook a literature review of 18 studies of interventions used for foster children and classified them under the controversial Saunders, Berliner, & Hanson (2004) system.<ref name= \"Craven\"/><ref name=\"Saunders 2004\">Saunders, B.E., Berliner, L., & Hanson, R.F.

Dumile went by the alias King Geedorah, a three-headed golden dragon space monster, modeled after [[King Ghidorah]], the [[Toho]] movie monster who was a three-headed dragon that often battled [[Godzilla]]. Some of his appearances on the LP are as, and are credited to, this persona instead of that of MF Doom. Dumile would revisit this character later under various name-spellings.\n\nIn 2001, he began working with [[Prince Paul (producer)|Prince Paul]], co-producing [[MC Paul Barman]]'s \"[[Paullelujah!]]\" with MikeTheMusicGuy and [[Phofo]]. In 2002, he appeared on the Sound-Ink's Colapsus collection, on a very hard to find track titled \"Monday Nite at Fluid\", featuring [[Kurious]] with production by King Honey, who also produced some tracks for Dumile's album ''[[Vaudeville Villain]]''.\n\nDumile has produced all the instrumentation tracks for his solo releases, with very few exceptions.<ref name=\"stonesthrow1\">{{cite web|url=http://stonesthrow.com/doom/discography|title=MF DOOM Discography|work=Official Doom Discography|accessdate=2012-11-10}}</ref> Beginning in 2001, under the \"Metal Fingers\" moniker, Dumile began releasing his ''[[Special Herbs]]'' instrumentals series. Many of these beats can be heard as the instrumentation tracks throughout his body of work. A separate website catalogs for which tracks each instrumental has been used.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalfacedoom.com|title=Metal Face Doom Special Herbs etc. series discography|work=metalfacedoom.com}}</ref>\n\n===2002\u20132004: King Geedorah, Viktor Vaughn, Madvillain===\nIn 2003, Dumile released the King Geedorah album ''[[Take Me to Your Leader (King Geedorah album)|Take Me to Your Leader]]''. Geedorah is credited as producer, but only appears as an MC on four tracks. The majority of vocal tracks feature guest MCs, and the album features several instrumental montages of sampled vocals from old movies and TV shows\u2014a technique employed on most of Dumile's albums. Later in 2003, Dumile released the LP ''[[Vaudeville Villain]]'' under the moniker Viktor Vaughn (another play on Doctor Doom, whose \"real name\" is ''Victor von'' Doom). In 2004 he released a follow-up LP under the Viktor Vaughn moniker, ''[[Venomous Villain]]''. Later in 2004, the second MF Doom album ''[[Mm.. Food]]'' was released by [[Minnesota]]-based label [[Rhymesayers Entertainment]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Nick Sylvester |url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5255-mmfood/ |title=MF DOOM: Mm..Food?

Released by [[Stones Throw Records]], the album was a critical and commercial success. MF Doom was seen by mainstream audiences for the first time as Madvillain received publicity and acclaim in publications such as ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The New Yorker]]'', and ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''. A video for \"All Caps\" and a four-date US tour followed the release of ''Madvillainy''.\n\n===2005\u20132009: Danger Doom and Ghostface collaboration===\nAlthough still an independent artist, MF Doom took a bigger step towards the mainstream in 2005 with ''[[The Mouse and the Mask]]'', a collaboration with producer [[DJ Danger Mouse]] under the group name [[Danger Doom]]. The album, released on 11 October 2005 by [[Epitaph Records|Epitaph]] and [[Lex Records|Lex]], was done in collaboration with [[Cartoon Network]]'s [[Adult Swim]] and featured voice-actors and characters from its programs (mostly ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]'').

Three tracks have been released since the album was announced, \"Angels\", which appeared on a ''[[Nature Sounds]]'' compilation in late 2006 (another version appears on Doom's 2009 album ''[[Born Like This]]''), \"Victory Laps\" and \"Lively Hood\" (a 2015 Adult Swim single).\n\nThe [[Madvillain]] song, \"Monkey Suite\", first appeared on the Adult Swim/[[Stones Throw Records]] compilation ''[[Chrome Children]]'', later it appeared on ''[[Madvillainy 2|Madvillainy 2: The Madlib Remix]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/61003/danger-doom-hopes-to-make-second-cd|title=Danger DOOM Hopes to Make Second CD|last=Martens|first=Todd|work=Billboard.com|date=19 October 2005}}</ref>\n\nOn May 30, 2006, Adult Swim released the Danger Doom ''[[Occult Hymn]]'' EP, a digital EP, and on July 6 the same year Lex released Danger Doom ''Old School EP''.

When Rodan left the group, Zev found another MC, Onyx the Birthstone Kid, to replace Rodan.<ref name=\"ALLMUSIC\"/> [[Artists and repertoire]] representative Dante Ross learned of KMD through the hip hop group [[3rd Bass]] and signed the group to [[Elektra Records]].<ref name=\"wax poetics\">Wax Poetics #9, Interview with Dante Ross</ref> Dumile and KMD's recording debut came on 3rd Bass's song \"The Gas Face\" from ''[[The Cactus Album]]'',<ref name=\"ALLMUSIC\"/> followed in 1991 with KMD's album ''[[Mr. Hood]]'', which became a minor hit through its singles \"Peachfuzz\", \"Who Me?\" and heavy video play on cable TV's ''[[Yo! MTV Raps]]'' and ''[[Rap City (BET program)|Rap City]]''.\n\nIn 1993, just before the release of the second KMD album, ''[[Black Bastards]]'',<ref name=\"ALLMUSIC\"/> Subroc was struck by a car and killed while attempting to cross the [[New York State Route 878|Nassau Expressway]], and that same week the group was dropped from Elektra Records. The album was shelved before it was released due to its controversial cover art,<ref name=\"wax poetics\"/> which featured a cartoon of a stereotypical [[pickaninny]] or [[Sambo (racial term)|sambo]] character being hanged. After the death of his brother, Dumile retreated from the hip hop scene from 1994 to 1997, living \"damn near homeless, walking the streets of [[Manhattan]], sleeping on benches\".<ref name=\"ALLMUSIC\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stonesthrow.com/madvillain/wire.html|title=Mask of Sorrow|last=Hsu|first=Hua|work=The Wire|date=1 March 2005|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060505130522/http://www.stonesthrow.com/madvillain/wire.html|archivedate=5 May 2006}}</ref> In the late 1990s, he left [[New York City]] and settled in [[Atlanta]].

He meanwhile had taken on a new identity, MF Doom, patterned after and wearing a mask similar to that of [[Marvel Comics]] super-villain [[Doctor Doom]], who is depicted rapping on the cover of the 1999 album ''[[Operation: Doomsday]]''. The album, in an earlier incarnation, would have been called ''The Super M.F. Villains'' according to an interview published in 1998 by hip-hop music culture magazine [[Ego Trip (magazine)|Ego Trip]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.egotripland.com/egotrip-interview-mf-doom-noah-callahan-bever/2/|title=International God of Mystery: An M.F.'n Look Back With M.F.

In 1999 Fondle 'Em released MF Doom's first full-length [[LP record|LP]], ''[[Operation: Doomsday]]'', which included these singles and their b-sides, and additional tracks. Dumile had used the spelling variant \"M.F. Doom\" for the singles' releases, but thereafter changed this to MF Doom. Among the collaborators on these tracks were fellow members of the [[Monsta Island Czars]] collective (The M.I.C.), for which each artist took on the persona of a monster from the [[Godzilla]] mythos. Dumile went by the alias King Geedorah, a three-headed golden dragon space monster, modeled after [[King Ghidorah]], the [[Toho]] movie monster who was a three-headed dragon that often battled [[Godzilla]]. Some of his appearances on the LP are as, and are credited to, this persona instead of that of MF Doom. Dumile would revisit this character later under various name-spellings.\n\nIn 2001, he began working with [[Prince Paul (producer)|Prince Paul]], co-producing [[MC Paul Barman]]'s \"[[Paullelujah!]]\" with MikeTheMusicGuy and [[Phofo]]. In 2002, he appeared on the Sound-Ink's Colapsus collection, on a very hard to find track titled \"Monday Nite at Fluid\", featuring [[Kurious]] with production by King Honey, who also produced some tracks for Dumile's album ''[[Vaudeville Villain]]''.\n\nDumile has produced all the instrumentation tracks for his solo releases, with very few exceptions.<ref name=\"stonesthrow1\">{{cite web|url=http://stonesthrow.com/doom/discography|title=MF DOOM Discography|work=Official Doom Discography|accessdate=2012-11-10}}</ref> Beginning in 2001, under the \"Metal Fingers\" moniker, Dumile began releasing his ''[[Special Herbs]]'' instrumentals series. Many of these beats can be heard as the instrumentation tracks throughout his body of work.

Geedorah is credited as producer, but only appears as an MC on four tracks. The majority of vocal tracks feature guest MCs, and the album features several instrumental montages of sampled vocals from old movies and TV shows\u2014a technique employed on most of Dumile's albums. Later in 2003, Dumile released the LP ''[[Vaudeville Villain]]'' under the moniker Viktor Vaughn (another play on Doctor Doom, whose \"real name\" is ''Victor von'' Doom). In 2004 he released a follow-up LP under the Viktor Vaughn moniker, ''[[Venomous Villain]]''. Later in 2004, the second MF Doom album ''[[Mm..

Released by [[Stones Throw Records]], the album was a critical and commercial success. MF Doom was seen by mainstream audiences for the first time as Madvillain received publicity and acclaim in publications such as ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The New Yorker]]'', and ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''. A video for \"All Caps\" and a four-date US tour followed the release of ''Madvillainy''.\n\n===2005\u20132009: Danger Doom and Ghostface collaboration===\nAlthough still an independent artist, MF Doom took a bigger step towards the mainstream in 2005 with ''[[The Mouse and the Mask]]'', a collaboration with producer [[DJ Danger Mouse]] under the group name [[Danger Doom]]. The album, released on 11 October 2005 by [[Epitaph Records|Epitaph]] and [[Lex Records|Lex]], was done in collaboration with [[Cartoon Network]]'s [[Adult Swim]] and featured voice-actors and characters from its programs (mostly ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]'').

She appeared in several plays, operas, and [[silent movies]] in the late 1910s and early 1920s, and also worked as an artist's model.<ref name=fridas>{{cite book |editor1-first=Rita |editor1-last=Arias-Jirasek |others= Alejandro G.

In 1918, Modotti began a romantic relationship with him and moved with him to [[Los Angeles]] in order to pursue a career in the motion picture industry.<ref name=Saunders/>  Although the couple cohabited and lived as a \"married couple\", they were not married. Often playing the [[femme fatale]], Modotti's movie career culminated in the 1920 film ''The Tiger's Coat''. She had minor parts in two other films.<ref name=fridas/>\n\nThe couple entered into a [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] circle of friends. One of these fellow bohemians was Ricardo G\u00f3mez Robelo. Another was the photographer, [[Edward Weston]].\n\n==Photography career==\nIt is unclear how Modotti was introduced to photography, but as a young girl in Italy her uncle, Pietro Modotti, maintained a photography studio. Later in the U.S., her father briefly ran a similar studio in San Francisco. While in Los Angeles, she met the photographer [[Edward Weston]] and his creative partner [[Margrethe Mather]]. It was through her relationship with Edward Weston that Modotti developed as an important fine art photographer and documentarian. By 1921, Modotti was Weston's lover.<ref name=Saunders/> Ricardo G\u00f3mez Robelo became the head of [[Mexico]]'s Ministry of Education's Fine Arts Department, and persuaded Robo to come to Mexico with a promise of a job and a studio.\n\nRobo left for Mexico in December 1921.<ref name=Saunders/> Perhaps unaware of his affair with Modotti, Robo took with him prints of Weston's, hoping to mount an exhibition of his and Weston's work in Mexico. While she was on her way to be with Robo, Modotti received word of his death from [[smallpox]] on February 9, 1922.<ref name=Saunders/> Devastated, she arrived two days after his death. In March 1922, determined to see Robo's vision realized, she mounted a two-week exhibition of Robo's and Weston's work at the National Academy of Fine Arts in [[Mexico City]]. She sustained a second loss with the death of her father, which forced her to return to San Francisco later in March 1922. In 1923, Modotti set sail for Mexico City with Weston and his son Chandler, leaving behind Weston's wife Flora and  their youngest three children.<ref name=\"Vision\">[http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/weston/ \"Edward Weston: Enduring Vision\"], The Getty, Retrieved 1 September 2015.</ref> She agreed to run Weston's studio free of charge in return for his mentoring her in photography.<ref name=\"Norton\">{{cite web |last1=Richard Norton Gallery |title=Tina Modotti |url=http://richardnortongallery.com/artists/tina-modotti/info-sheets/1611.pdf |accessdate=23 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nTogether they opened a portrait studio in Mexico City. Modotti and Weston quickly gravitated toward the capital's bohemian scene, and used their connections to create an expanding portrait business. Together they found a community of cultural and political \"[[avant garde|avant-gardists]]\", which included [[Frida Kahlo]], [[Lupe Mar\u00edn]], [[Diego Rivera]], and [[Jean Charlot]].<ref name=Albers/> In general, Weston was moved by the landscape and folk art of Mexico to create abstract works, while Modotti was more captivated by the people of Mexico and blended this human interest with a modernist aesthetic. Modotti also became the photographer of choice for the blossoming [[Mexican muralism|Mexican mural movement]], documenting the works of [[Jos\u00e9 Clemente Orozco]] and [[Diego Rivera]].<ref>[http://richardnortongallery.com/exhibitions/25-tina-modotti \"Tina Modotti\"], Richard Norton Gallery, Retrieved 1 September 2015.</ref> Between 1924-1928, Modotti took hundreds of photographs of Rivera's murals at the [[Secretariat of Public Education]] in [[Mexico City]].<ref>[http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/267261 \"After Diego Rivera\"], The Metropolitan Museum of Art, Retrieved 1 September 2015.</ref> Modotti's visual vocabulary matured during this period, such as her formal experiments with architectural interiors, flowers, and urban landscapes, and especially in her many lyrical images of peasants and workers. In 1926, Modotti and Weston were commissioned by [[Anita Brenner]] to travel around Mexico and take photographs for what would become her influential book ''Idols Behind Altars''.<ref name=\"Albers\">Albers, Patricia and Stourdze, Sam.

Weston's son Brett, who accompanied the two on the project, indicated that the photographs were taken by Edward Weston.\n\nIn 1925, Modotti joined [[International Red Aid]], a [[Communism|Communist]] organization.<ref name=Albers/> In November 1926, Weston left Mexico and returned to living in California.<ref name=Vision/> During this time Modotti met several political radicals and Communists, including three [[Mexican Communist Party]] leaders who would all eventually become romantically linked with her: [[Xavier Guerrero]], [[Julio Antonio Mella]], and [[Vittorio Vidali]].\n\nStarting in 1927, a much more politically active Modotti (she joined the Mexican Communist Party that year) found her focus shifting and more of her work becoming politically motivated.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lowe |first1=Sarah Margaret |title=Tina Modotti\u2019s Vision: Photographic Modernism in Mexico 1923-1930 |journal=PhD diss. |date=1996 |page=143 |url=https://academicworks.cuny.edu/gc_etds/1702/}}</ref> Around that time her photographs began appearing in publications such as ''Mexican Folkways'', ''Forma'', and the more radically motivated ''El Machete'', the [[KPD|German Communist Party]]'s ''[[Arbeiter-Illustrierte-Zeitung]]'' (AIZ), and ''[[New Masses]]''.<ref name=fridas/>\n\nMexican photographer [[Manuel \u00c1lvarez Bravo]] divided Modotti's career as a photographer into two distinct categories: \"Romantic\" and \"Revolutionary\", with the former period including her time spent as Weston's darkroom assistant, office manager and, finally, creative partner. Her later works were the focus of her [[Solo show (art exhibition)|one-woman]] retrospective exhibition at the [[National Library of Mexico|National Library]] in December 1929, which was advertised as \"The First Revolutionary Photographic Exhibition In Mexico\".\n\n==Life as an activist==\nModotti began a relationship with Xavier Guerrero, who was a member of the Mexican Communist Party, in 1927.<ref name=\"Dyer\">Dyer, Geoff. [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2004/apr/29/photography \"Once upon a time in Mexico\"], ''The Guardian'', Retrieved 1 September 2015.</ref> Guerrero was sent to [[Moscow]] for a year to take part in political party training, and by 1928 Modotti had met and began a relationship with the exiled Cuban activist Julio Antonio Mella.<ref name=Dyer/> During this same period, economic and political conflicts within Mexico and indeed much of Central and South America were intensifying and this included increased repression of political dissidents. In 1929, Mella was assassinated while walking in the street with Modotti from the offices of Red Aid.<ref name=Dyer/> Modotti was immediately arrested, but later released and cleared of his murder.<ref name=Dyer/> Shortly thereafter, an attempt was made on the life of the Mexican President [[Pascual Ortiz Rubio]]. Modotti \u2014 who was a target of both the Mexican and Italian political police<ref name=Hooks>Hooks, Margaret. ''Tina Modotti, photographer and revolutionary''. London: Pandora, 1993. {{ISBN|0-04-440879-X}}</ref> \u2014 was questioned about both crimes amidst a concerted anti-communist, anti-immigrant press campaign, that depicted \"the fierce and bloody Tina Modotti\" as the perpetrator (a Catholic zealot, Daniel Luis Flores, was later charged with shooting Rubio.

New Haven and London: Yale University Press. {{ISBN|9780300098532}}.</ref>\n\nAs a result of the anti-communist campaign by the Mexican government, Modotti was exiled from Mexico in 1930.<ref name=Dyer/> She first spent several months in [[Berlin]], followed by several years in Moscow.<ref name=Dyer/> Traveling on a restricted visa that mandated her final destination as Italy, Modotti initially stopped in Berlin and from there visited Switzerland. The Italian government made concerted efforts to extradite her as a subversive national, but with the assistance of International Red Aid activists, she evaded detention by the fascist police. She apparently intended to make her way into Italy to join the anti-fascist resistance there. In response to the deteriorating political situation in Germany and her own exhausted resources, however, she followed the advice of Vittorio Vidali and moved to Moscow in 1931.<ref name=Hooks/> After 1931, Modotti no longer photographed. Reports of later photographs are unsubstantiated.\n\nDuring the next few years she engaged in various missions on behalf of the [[Workers International Relief]] organizations as a [[Communist International|Comintern]] agent in Europe. When the [[Spanish Civil War]] erupted in 1936, Vidali (then known as \"Comandante Carlos\") and Modotti (using the pseudonym \"Maria\") left Moscow for Spain, where they stayed and worked until 1939. She worked with Canadian [[Dr. Norman Bethune]] during the disastrous retreat from [[M\u00e1laga]] in 1937. In 1939, following the collapse of the Republican movement in Spain, Modotti left Spain with Vidali and returned to Mexico under a pseudonym.<ref name=Dyer/>\n\n==Death==\nIn 1942, at the age of 45, Modotti died from heart failure while on her way home in a taxi from a dinner at [[Pablo Neruda]]'s home in [[Mexico City]], under what are viewed by some<ref>https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0595322/</ref> as suspicious circumstances.<ref name=Saunders/> After hearing about her death, [[Diego Rivera]] suggested that Vidali had orchestrated it. Modotti may have 'known too much' about Vidali's activities in Spain, which included a rumoured 400 executions. An autopsy showed that she died of natural causes, namely [[congestive heart failure]].<ref name=Saunders/> Her grave is located within the vast [[Pante\u00f3n de Dolores]] in Mexico City. Poet [[Pablo Neruda]] composed Modotti's epitaph, part of which can also be found on her tombstone, which also includes a relief portrait of Modotti by engraver [[Leopoldo M\u00e9ndez]]:\n\n:''Pure your gentle name, pure your fragile life,''\n:''bees, shadows, fire, snow, silence and foam,''\n:''combined with steel and wire and''\n:''pollen to make up your firm''\n:''and delicate being.''\n\n==Murals by Diego Rivera that include Modotti==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2013}}\n*''The Abundant Earth'', The National Agricultural School, [[Chapingo]], 1926<ref>http://www.wikiart.org/en/diego-rivera/the-abundant-earth-1926</ref>\n:In 1926, Diego Rivera's wife Lupe Mar\u00edn asserted that her separation from her husband was caused by his affair with Modotti, which had arisen from Modotti's nude modeling for him for the murals as ''the Abundant Earth'' at the National Agricultural School in Chapingo, near [[Texcoco, M\u00e9xico|Texcoco]] [1926-27]. Their affair lasted for about a year and he painted her five times in the Chapingo murals, including as ''The Earth Enslaved'', ''Germination'', and ''Virgin Earth''.\n\n*''In the Arsenal'', [[Secretar\u00eda de Educaci\u00f3n P\u00fablica]] Building, Mexico City, 1928\n:This painting was part of the break between Modotti and Rivera caused by his expulsion from the Communist Party. The mural depicts Modotti passing out ammunition, perhaps for the revolution of [[Augusto Sandino]] in Nicaragua, perhaps for the \"invasion\" of Cuba that Mella was planning at that time hoping to overthrow the regime of General [[Gerardo Machado]], or perhaps just in support of insurrection against injustice everywhere. She is shown gazing at her then lover Mella while Vidali peers over her shoulder. Modotti objected to Rivera's use of her private life in such a public manner. She wrote to Weston, \"Recently Diego has taken to painting details with an exaggerated precision. He leaves nothing to the imagination.\" The central figure in this painting is Rivera's then-lover, the artist [[Frida Kahlo]]. Kahlo, who had first met Rivera as a schoolgirl in 1922 when he was painting his first mural ''The Creation'' in the Bol\u00edvar Auditorium of the [[National Preparatory School]] in Mexico City, is reputed to have been reintroduced to Rivera in 1928 at a party in Modotti's home, although there are other versions of the tale of their meeting. Modotti hosted Kahlo and Rivera's wedding party on 21 August 1929. The final rift between Modotti on the one hand and Rivera and Kahlo on the other, less than a month later, appears to have been political rather than personal. Modotti supported Rivera's expulsion from the Communist Party. Modotti's internationalism, and her belief that this was best advanced by adherence to the line of the Mexican Communist Party and the [[Communist International]], were deeply held. Later, she explained her decision to abandon photography for political work following her expulsion from Mexico thus (inverting an outlook stated to her years earlier by Edward Weston): \"I cannot solve the problem of life by losing myself in the problem of art\". Rivera's expulsion started him on a trajectory which was to lead to his later association with [[Leon Trotsky]] and the [[Fourth International]].\n\n==Select photography exhibitions==\nIn 1996 the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] organized a large-scale retrospective dedicated to the artist, entitled ''Tina Modotti: Photographs''.<ref>[http://www.philamuseum.org/exhibitions/1995/484.html \"Tina Modotti: Photographs\"], Philadelphia Museum of Art, Retrieved 23 August 2015.</ref> Martha Chahroudi, the museum's curator of photography, organized the exhibition.

In 1918, Modotti began a romantic relationship with him and moved with him to [[Los Angeles]] in order to pursue a career in the motion picture industry.<ref name=Saunders/>  Although the couple cohabited and lived as a \"married couple\", they were not married. Often playing the [[femme fatale]], Modotti's movie career culminated in the 1920 film ''The Tiger's Coat''. She had minor parts in two other films.<ref name=fridas/>\n\nThe couple entered into a [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] circle of friends. One of these fellow bohemians was Ricardo G\u00f3mez Robelo. Another was the photographer, [[Edward Weston]].\n\n==Photography career==\nIt is unclear how Modotti was introduced to photography, but as a young girl in Italy her uncle, Pietro Modotti, maintained a photography studio. Later in the U.S., her father briefly ran a similar studio in San Francisco. While in Los Angeles, she met the photographer [[Edward Weston]] and his creative partner [[Margrethe Mather]]. It was through her relationship with Edward Weston that Modotti developed as an important fine art photographer and documentarian. By 1921, Modotti was Weston's lover.<ref name=Saunders/> Ricardo G\u00f3mez Robelo became the head of [[Mexico]]'s Ministry of Education's Fine Arts Department, and persuaded Robo to come to Mexico with a promise of a job and a studio.\n\nRobo left for Mexico in December 1921.<ref name=Saunders/> Perhaps unaware of his affair with Modotti, Robo took with him prints of Weston's, hoping to mount an exhibition of his and Weston's work in Mexico. While she was on her way to be with Robo, Modotti received word of his death from [[smallpox]] on February 9, 1922.<ref name=Saunders/> Devastated, she arrived two days after his death. In March 1922, determined to see Robo's vision realized, she mounted a two-week exhibition of Robo's and Weston's work at the National Academy of Fine Arts in [[Mexico City]]. She sustained a second loss with the death of her father, which forced her to return to San Francisco later in March 1922. In 1923, Modotti set sail for Mexico City with Weston and his son Chandler, leaving behind Weston's wife Flora and  their youngest three children.<ref name=\"Vision\">[http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/weston/ \"Edward Weston: Enduring Vision\"], The Getty, Retrieved 1 September 2015.</ref> She agreed to run Weston's studio free of charge in return for his mentoring her in photography.<ref name=\"Norton\">{{cite web |last1=Richard Norton Gallery |title=Tina Modotti |url=http://richardnortongallery.com/artists/tina-modotti/info-sheets/1611.pdf |accessdate=23 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nTogether they opened a portrait studio in Mexico City. Modotti and Weston quickly gravitated toward the capital's bohemian scene, and used their connections to create an expanding portrait business. Together they found a community of cultural and political \"[[avant garde|avant-gardists]]\", which included [[Frida Kahlo]], [[Lupe Mar\u00edn]], [[Diego Rivera]], and [[Jean Charlot]].<ref name=Albers/> In general, Weston was moved by the landscape and folk art of Mexico to create abstract works, while Modotti was more captivated by the people of Mexico and blended this human interest with a modernist aesthetic. Modotti also became the photographer of choice for the blossoming [[Mexican muralism|Mexican mural movement]], documenting the works of [[Jos\u00e9 Clemente Orozco]] and [[Diego Rivera]].<ref>[http://richardnortongallery.com/exhibitions/25-tina-modotti \"Tina Modotti\"], Richard Norton Gallery, Retrieved 1 September 2015.</ref> Between 1924-1928, Modotti took hundreds of photographs of Rivera's murals at the [[Secretariat of Public Education]] in [[Mexico City]].<ref>[http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/267261 \"After Diego Rivera\"], The Metropolitan Museum of Art, Retrieved 1 September 2015.</ref> Modotti's visual vocabulary matured during this period, such as her formal experiments with architectural interiors, flowers, and urban landscapes, and especially in her many lyrical images of peasants and workers. In 1926, Modotti and Weston were commissioned by [[Anita Brenner]] to travel around Mexico and take photographs for what would become her influential book ''Idols Behind Altars''.<ref name=\"Albers\">Albers, Patricia and Stourdze, Sam.

Weston's son Brett, who accompanied the two on the project, indicated that the photographs were taken by Edward Weston.\n\nIn 1925, Modotti joined [[International Red Aid]], a [[Communism|Communist]] organization.<ref name=Albers/> In November 1926, Weston left Mexico and returned to living in California.<ref name=Vision/> During this time Modotti met several political radicals and Communists, including three [[Mexican Communist Party]] leaders who would all eventually become romantically linked with her: [[Xavier Guerrero]], [[Julio Antonio Mella]], and [[Vittorio Vidali]].\n\nStarting in 1927, a much more politically active Modotti (she joined the Mexican Communist Party that year) found her focus shifting and more of her work becoming politically motivated.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lowe |first1=Sarah Margaret |title=Tina Modotti\u2019s Vision: Photographic Modernism in Mexico 1923-1930 |journal=PhD diss. |date=1996 |page=143 |url=https://academicworks.cuny.edu/gc_etds/1702/}}</ref> Around that time her photographs began appearing in publications such as ''Mexican Folkways'', ''Forma'', and the more radically motivated ''El Machete'', the [[KPD|German Communist Party]]'s ''[[Arbeiter-Illustrierte-Zeitung]]'' (AIZ), and ''[[New Masses]]''.<ref name=fridas/>\n\nMexican photographer [[Manuel \u00c1lvarez Bravo]] divided Modotti's career as a photographer into two distinct categories: \"Romantic\" and \"Revolutionary\", with the former period including her time spent as Weston's darkroom assistant, office manager and, finally, creative partner. Her later works were the focus of her [[Solo show (art exhibition)|one-woman]] retrospective exhibition at the [[National Library of Mexico|National Library]] in December 1929, which was advertised as \"The First Revolutionary Photographic Exhibition In Mexico\".\n\n==Life as an activist==\nModotti began a relationship with Xavier Guerrero, who was a member of the Mexican Communist Party, in 1927.<ref name=\"Dyer\">Dyer, Geoff. [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2004/apr/29/photography \"Once upon a time in Mexico\"], ''The Guardian'', Retrieved 1 September 2015.</ref> Guerrero was sent to [[Moscow]] for a year to take part in political party training, and by 1928 Modotti had met and began a relationship with the exiled Cuban activist Julio Antonio Mella.<ref name=Dyer/> During this same period, economic and political conflicts within Mexico and indeed much of Central and South America were intensifying and this included increased repression of political dissidents. In 1929, Mella was assassinated while walking in the street with Modotti from the offices of Red Aid.<ref name=Dyer/> Modotti was immediately arrested, but later released and cleared of his murder.<ref name=Dyer/> Shortly thereafter, an attempt was made on the life of the Mexican President [[Pascual Ortiz Rubio]]. Modotti \u2014 who was a target of both the Mexican and Italian political police<ref name=Hooks>Hooks, Margaret. ''Tina Modotti, photographer and revolutionary''.

New Haven and London: Yale University Press. {{ISBN|9780300098532}}.</ref>\n\nAs a result of the anti-communist campaign by the Mexican government, Modotti was exiled from Mexico in 1930.<ref name=Dyer/> She first spent several months in [[Berlin]], followed by several years in Moscow.<ref name=Dyer/> Traveling on a restricted visa that mandated her final destination as Italy, Modotti initially stopped in Berlin and from there visited Switzerland. The Italian government made concerted efforts to extradite her as a subversive national, but with the assistance of International Red Aid activists, she evaded detention by the fascist police. She apparently intended to make her way into Italy to join the anti-fascist resistance there. In response to the deteriorating political situation in Germany and her own exhausted resources, however, she followed the advice of Vittorio Vidali and moved to Moscow in 1931.<ref name=Hooks/> After 1931, Modotti no longer photographed. Reports of later photographs are unsubstantiated.\n\nDuring the next few years she engaged in various missions on behalf of the [[Workers International Relief]] organizations as a [[Communist International|Comintern]] agent in Europe. When the [[Spanish Civil War]] erupted in 1936, Vidali (then known as \"Comandante Carlos\") and Modotti (using the pseudonym \"Maria\") left Moscow for Spain, where they stayed and worked until 1939. She worked with Canadian [[Dr. Norman Bethune]] during the disastrous retreat from [[M\u00e1laga]] in 1937. In 1939, following the collapse of the Republican movement in Spain, Modotti left Spain with Vidali and returned to Mexico under a pseudonym.<ref name=Dyer/>\n\n==Death==\nIn 1942, at the age of 45, Modotti died from heart failure while on her way home in a taxi from a dinner at [[Pablo Neruda]]'s home in [[Mexico City]], under what are viewed by some<ref>https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0595322/</ref> as suspicious circumstances.<ref name=Saunders/> After hearing about her death, [[Diego Rivera]] suggested that Vidali had orchestrated it. Modotti may have 'known too much' about Vidali's activities in Spain, which included a rumoured 400 executions. An autopsy showed that she died of natural causes, namely [[congestive heart failure]].<ref name=Saunders/> Her grave is located within the vast [[Pante\u00f3n de Dolores]] in Mexico City. Poet [[Pablo Neruda]] composed Modotti's epitaph, part of which can also be found on her tombstone, which also includes a relief portrait of Modotti by engraver [[Leopoldo M\u00e9ndez]]:\n\n:''Pure your gentle name, pure your fragile life,''\n:''bees, shadows, fire, snow, silence and foam,''\n:''combined with steel and wire and''\n:''pollen to make up your firm''\n:''and delicate being.''\n\n==Murals by Diego Rivera that include Modotti==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2013}}\n*''The Abundant Earth'', The National Agricultural School, [[Chapingo]], 1926<ref>http://www.wikiart.org/en/diego-rivera/the-abundant-earth-1926</ref>\n:In 1926, Diego Rivera's wife Lupe Mar\u00edn asserted that her separation from her husband was caused by his affair with Modotti, which had arisen from Modotti's nude modeling for him for the murals as ''the Abundant Earth'' at the National Agricultural School in Chapingo, near [[Texcoco, M\u00e9xico|Texcoco]] [1926-27]. Their affair lasted for about a year and he painted her five times in the Chapingo murals, including as ''The Earth Enslaved'', ''Germination'', and ''Virgin Earth''.\n\n*''In the Arsenal'', [[Secretar\u00eda de Educaci\u00f3n P\u00fablica]] Building, Mexico City, 1928\n:This painting was part of the break between Modotti and Rivera caused by his expulsion from the Communist Party. The mural depicts Modotti passing out ammunition, perhaps for the revolution of [[Augusto Sandino]] in Nicaragua, perhaps for the \"invasion\" of Cuba that Mella was planning at that time hoping to overthrow the regime of General [[Gerardo Machado]], or perhaps just in support of insurrection against injustice everywhere. She is shown gazing at her then lover Mella while Vidali peers over her shoulder. Modotti objected to Rivera's use of her private life in such a public manner. She wrote to Weston, \"Recently Diego has taken to painting details with an exaggerated precision. He leaves nothing to the imagination.\" The central figure in this painting is Rivera's then-lover, the artist [[Frida Kahlo]]. Kahlo, who had first met Rivera as a schoolgirl in 1922 when he was painting his first mural ''The Creation'' in the Bol\u00edvar Auditorium of the [[National Preparatory School]] in Mexico City, is reputed to have been reintroduced to Rivera in 1928 at a party in Modotti's home, although there are other versions of the tale of their meeting. Modotti hosted Kahlo and Rivera's wedding party on 21 August 1929. The final rift between Modotti on the one hand and Rivera and Kahlo on the other, less than a month later, appears to have been political rather than personal. Modotti supported Rivera's expulsion from the Communist Party. Modotti's internationalism, and her belief that this was best advanced by adherence to the line of the Mexican Communist Party and the [[Communist International]], were deeply held. Later, she explained her decision to abandon photography for political work following her expulsion from Mexico thus (inverting an outlook stated to her years earlier by Edward Weston): \"I cannot solve the problem of life by losing myself in the problem of art\".

In a June 16, 1999, speech, Cuomo declared that one purpose of the program was to fight against HUD's abolition. In August 1999, Community Builders distributed a letter to community groups to fight against proposed tax cuts.
