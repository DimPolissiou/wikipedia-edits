It allegedly enabled the practitioner to see \"all the seven worlds of Hell (Patala)\".<ref>{{Internet Archive|RigvedaSamhitaSiddhanjanaPart1KapaliSastryT.V.|Rigveda Samhita Siddhanjana Part 1 Kapali Sastry T.

The color range varies from a yellowish brown to pitch-black, depending on composition. For use in Ayurvedic medicine the black variant is considered the most potent. Shilajeet has been described as 'mineral oil', 'stone oil', 'Mountain Blood' or 'rock sweat', as it seeps from cracks in mountains due mostly to the warmth of the sun. There are many local legends and stories about its origin, use and properties, often wildly exaggerated. It should not be confused with [[ozokerite]], also a humic substance, similar in appearance, but apparently without medicinal qualities.\n\nOnce cleaned of impurities and extracted, Shilajeet is a homogeneous brown-black paste-like substance, with a glossy surface, a peculiar smell and bitter taste. Dry Shilajeet density ranges from 1.1 to 1.8 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. It has a plastic-like behavior, at a temperature lower than 20&nbsp;\u00b0C (68&nbsp;\u00b0F) it will solidify and will soften when warmed. It easily dissolves in water without leaving any residue, and it will soften when worked between the fingers.\n\nIt is still unclear whether Shilajeet has a geological or biological origin as it has numerous traces of [[vitamin]]s and [[amino acid]]s. A Shilajeet-like substance from [[Antarctica]] was found to contain [[glycerol]] derivatives and was also believed to have medicinal properties.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Mumijo Traditional Medicine: Fossil Deposits from Antarctica (Chemical Composition and Beneficial Bioactivity) |authors=Anna Aiello, Ernesto Fattorusso, Marialuisa Menna, Rocco Vitalone, Heinz C.

Depending on where the Shilajit is collected from, it may look slightly lighter or darker in color, as well as being tinged with shades of amber or red. Shilajit is very similar to other humic substances found in the soil as it is about 60-80% humus - however, after millions of years and under precise conditions as found at high altitudes, these substances undergo a profound change.\n\nShilajit has a melting point of 80&nbsp;\u00b0C/176&nbsp;\u00b0F. If placed in a fridge or kept at low temperatures, Shilajit resin begins to harden and becomes brittle.\n\nMumijo has an exceptionally high affinity for water and is able to dissolve readily in water, whether at room temperature or heated. Shilajit does not dissolve into oil as it does in water, however it does naturally contain a small portion of fatty acid components. In resin or powder form, one can easily mix it into an ointment.\n\nThe list of elements in Shilajit<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.purehimalayanshilajit.com/benefits/ |title=Shilajit Benefits, Myths and List of Organic Elements |last=Matyukhin |first=Valentin |last2=Ironclad |first2=Polly |publisher=Open Publishing |date=2017-08-01 |website=Pure Himalayan Shilajit |access-date=2019-07-28}}</ref> remains more or less the same across all types, with slight differences in the ratios of each depending on the geographical origin.\n\n==Health benefits==\nThe proposed immuno-modulatory activity does not stand the test of critical assessment and is considered as unproven.<ref name=Wilson-2911/>\n\nShilajeet has been the subject of scientific research in [[Russia]] and [[India]] since the early 1950s.

A famous alchemical Siddhanjana also known as the \"ointment of Mags\" included camphor, shilajatu, some psychoactive herbs, as well as metal oxides and minerals. It allegedly enabled the practitioner to see \"all the seven worlds of Hell (Patala)\".<ref>{{Internet Archive|RigvedaSamhitaSiddhanjanaPart1KapaliSastryT.V.|Rigveda Samhita Siddhanjana Part 1 Kapali Sastry T. V.}}</ref>\nShilajeet is found predominantly in [[Himalaya]], [[Tibet mountains]], [[Altai Mountains|Altai]] and [[Caucasus mountains]]. The color range varies from a yellowish brown to pitch-black, depending on composition. For use in Ayurvedic medicine the black variant is considered the most potent. Shilajeet has been described as 'mineral oil', 'stone oil', 'Mountain Blood' or 'rock sweat', as it seeps from cracks in mountains due mostly to the warmth of the sun. There are many local legends and stories about its origin, use and properties, often wildly exaggerated. It should not be confused with [[ozokerite]], also a humic substance, similar in appearance, but apparently without medicinal qualities.\n\nOnce cleaned of impurities and extracted, Shilajeet is a homogeneous brown-black paste-like substance, with a glossy surface, a peculiar smell and bitter taste. Dry Shilajeet density ranges from 1.1 to 1.8 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. It has a plastic-like behavior, at a temperature lower than 20&nbsp;\u00b0C (68&nbsp;\u00b0F) it will solidify and will soften when warmed. It easily dissolves in water without leaving any residue, and it will soften when worked between the fingers.\n\nIt is still unclear whether Shilajeet has a geological or biological origin as it has numerous traces of [[vitamin]]s and [[amino acid]]s. A Shilajeet-like substance from [[Antarctica]] was found to contain [[glycerol]] derivatives and was also believed to have medicinal properties.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Mumijo Traditional Medicine: Fossil Deposits from Antarctica (Chemical Composition and Beneficial Bioactivity) |authors=Anna Aiello, Ernesto Fattorusso, Marialuisa Menna, Rocco Vitalone, Heinz C.

Depending on where the Shilajit is collected from, it may look slightly lighter or darker in color, as well as being tinged with shades of amber or red. Shilajit is very similar to other humic substances found in the soil as it is about 60-80% humus - however, after millions of years and under precise conditions as found at high altitudes, these substances undergo a profound change.\n\nShilajit has a melting point of 80&nbsp;\u00b0C/176&nbsp;\u00b0F. If placed in a fridge or kept at low temperatures, Shilajit resin begins to harden and becomes brittle.\n\nMumijo has an exceptionally high affinity for water and is able to dissolve readily in water, whether at room temperature or heated. Shilajit does not dissolve into oil as it does in water, however it does naturally contain a small portion of fatty acid components. In resin or powder form, one can easily mix it into an ointment.\n\nThe list of elements in Shilajit<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.purehimalayanshilajit.com/benefits/ |title=Shilajit Benefits, Myths and List of Organic Elements |last=Matyukhin |first=Valentin |last2=Ironclad |first2=Polly |publisher=Open Publishing |date=2017-08-01 |website=Pure Himalayan Shilajit |access-date=2019-07-28}}</ref> remains more or less the same across all types, with slight differences in the ratios of each depending on the geographical origin.\n\n==Health benefits==\nThe proposed immuno-modulatory activity does not stand the test of critical assessment and is considered as unproven.<ref name=Wilson-2911/>\n\nShilajeet has been the subject of scientific research in [[Russia]] and [[India]] since the early 1950s.

The banknotes were issued between 1976 and 1992 by the [[Central Bank of Ireland]], the series was replaced in 1993 by [[Series C Banknotes (Ireland)|Series C Banknotes]].\n{{Main|Banknotes of the Republic of Ireland}}\n\n==Banknotes==\nThe Central Bank announced its intention for the new banknotes in December 1971 and Servicon, an Irish design company, was employed to design the notes of the denominations; \u00a31, \u00a35, \u00a310, \u00a320, \u00a350 and \u00a3100. The \u00a3100 note was never issued or circulated; this remains somewhat of an idiosyncrasy in the issue of Irish banknotes as this is the only series without a note of this denomination. The series was Legal Tender from 1976-1995, although not printed after May 1993.\n\nThe theme chosen for these notes was [[history of Ireland]], and each note featured the portrait of a person with this theme in mind from a particular era from historic to modern and complementing visual elements. The female head painted by Sir [[John Lavery]] was retained from Series A; contained in the unprinted space. Each banknote has the signature of the Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland and the Secretary of the Department of Finance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.irishpapermoney.com/b-series-banknotes-central-bank-of-ireland-1976%E2%80%931993.html|title=Ireland Legal Tender Notes: B Series Banknotes - Introduction|website=www.irishpapermoney.com|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> \n\nDuring much of the period of circulation of this series, [[foreign exchange controls]] prohibited the export of any notes larger than \u00a320 from the Republic. \n\n===One Pound===\nThe [[green]] one pound note had a portrait of [[Medb]], the legendary [[Kings of Connacht|Queen of Connacht]] in [[Irish mythology]].

The letter A from the start of Psalm 17 of the [[Ricemarch Psalter|Psalter of Ricemarcus]] is used against the [[Book of Durrow]].\n\nThe reverse featured an adaptation of animal and script extracts from the [[Book of Kells]], an eighth century copy of the [[gospel]]s.\n\nThe dimension of the notes are 82.0 X 156.0 millimetres. In addition to the dominant orange, red and brown is used on both sides of the note.\n\n===Ten Pounds===\nThe [[purple]] ten pound had a portrait of Dean [[Jonathan Swift]] the [[Poetry|poet]] and [[Satire|satirist]].

Great Abbey Street and Astons Quay - now known as Middle Abbey Street and Aston Quay respectively are shown as well as the [[River Liffey]].\n\nThe dimension of the notes are 86.0 X 164.0 millimetres. The note consists of shades of purple - three shades on the front and two on the back.\n\n===Twenty Pounds===\nThe [[blue]] twenty pound note had a portrait of [[William Butler Yeats]], the [[Irish poetry|poet]], [[drama]]tist, and [[mysticism|mystic]] together with a representation of the [[Irish mythology|mythological hero]] [[C\u00fa Chulainn]], based on the motif used by the [[Abbey Theatre]]. The background is of a [[Deirdre]], a Yeats manuscript.\n\nThe reverse had image the [[Blasket Islands]], off [[County Kerry]] with the background of ''[[An tOile\u00e1nach]]'' by [[Tom\u00e1s \u00d3 Criomhthain]]. \n\nThe dimension of the notes are 90.0 X 172.0 millimetres. The note consists of shades of blue - six shades on the front and four on the back.\n\n===Fifty Pounds===\nThe [[red]]-[[brown]] fifty pound note had a portrait of [[Turlough O'Carolan]], the [[Blindness|blind]] [[Ireland|Irish]] [[harp]]er and [[composer]], with the background from Timbrell.\n\nThe reverse had a design based on the wood carvings on the organ loft of [[St. Michan's Church]], Dublin.\n\nThe dimension of the notes are 94.0 X 180.0 millimetres.

A design pattern was done for a \u00a3100 denomination, but it was not required by the Central Bank of Ireland. Although during the late 1970s some newspapers reported that a planned \u00a3100 note would have been Mauve in colour and would have had [[Grace O'Malley]] on the front, the [[Galtee Mountains]] on the reverse and the dimension of the notes in size 188 x 98 mm.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.irishpapermoney.com/b-series-100-pounds-Granuaile.html|title=Central Bank of Ireland - B Series Banknotes 100 Pounds Granuaile - Grace O Malley|website=www.irishpapermoney.com|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n* [https://www.centralbank.ie/consumer-hub/notes-and-coins/historical-banknotes/1970s---1990s Series B (1976/82 - 1989/93) Irish Writers, Philosophers and Artists banknotes]\n\n{{Portal bar|Ireland|Money|Numismatics|Republic of Ireland}}\n\n{{Irish currency and coinage}}\n\n[[Category:Currencies of the Republic of Ireland]]\n[[Category:Banknotes of Ireland|Ireland B]]\n", "name_user": "G\u00fcnniX", "label": "safe", "comment": "Reflist", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_B_Banknotes"}

From 1950 to 1974 the 88 was the division's top-selling line, particularly the entry-level models such as the 88 and Dynamic 88. The 88 series was also an image leader for Oldsmobile, particularly in the early years (1949\u201351) when it was one of the best performing automobiles thanks to its relatively small size, light weight and advanced overhead-valve high-compression V8 engine. This engine, originally designed for the larger [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-bodied]] and more luxurious 98 series, also replaced the [[Oldsmobile Straight-8 engine|straight-8]] on the smaller [[GM B platform|B-bodied]] [[Oldsmobile Series 70|78]]. With the large, high performance V8, the Oldsmobile 88 is considered by some to be the first [[muscle car]], although this title is disputed.\n\nA large number of variations in nomenclature were seen over this long model run \u2014 Futuramic, Super, Golden Rocket, Dynamic, Jetstar, Delta, Delmont, Starfire, Holiday, L/S, LSS, Celebrity, and Royale were used at various times with the 88 badge, and Fiesta appeared on some station wagons in the 1950s and 1960s. The name was more commonly shown as numbers in the earlier years (\"Delta 88\", for example) and was changed to spell out \"Eighty Eight\" starting in 1989.\n\n== First generation (1949\u20131953) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name         = First generation\n| image        = File:1950 Oldsmobile Rockett 88 DE-93-36 p6.jpg\n| caption      = 1950 Oldsmobile 88\n| aka          = {{unbulleted list|Oldsmobile DeLuxe 88|Oldsmobile Super 88}}\n| model_years  = 1949\u20131953\n| assembly     = {{unbulleted list|[[South Gate, California]]|[[Wilmington, Delaware]]|[[Doraville, Georgia]]|[[Kansas City, Kansas]]|[[Framingham, Massachusetts]]|[[Lansing, Michigan]]|[[Linden, New Jersey]]}}\n| body_style   = {{unbulleted list|2-door ''Holiday'' [[hardtop]]|2-door [[coupe]]|4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]|4-door [[station wagon]]}}\n| layout       = [[Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout|FR layout]]\n| platform     = [[GM B platform|B-body]]\n| related      = {{unbulleted list|[[Buick Special]]|[[Pontiac Streamliner]]}}\n| engine       = {{convert|303|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Oldsmobile V8 engine#303|Rocket]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]]\n| transmission = {{unbulleted list|3-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]]|4-speed ''[[Hydramatic|Hydra-Matic]]'' [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]}}\n| wheelbase    = {{unbulleted list|1949\u201350: {{convert|119.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}|1951 88: {{convert|119.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}|1951 Super 88: {{convert|120|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}|1952\u201353: {{convert|120|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}}}\n| length       = {{convert|202|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Oldsmobile/1951%20Oldsmobile/1951_Oldsmobile_Foldout/1951%20Oldsmobile%20Foldout-18.html|title=Directory Index: Oldsmobile/1951 Oldsmobile/1951_Oldsmobile_Foldout|publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com|date= |accessdate=2012-01-08}}</ref>\n| width       = {{convert|75.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"flory2008\">{{cite book|last=Flory, Jr.|first=J. \"Kelly\"|title=American Cars, 1946-1959 Every Model Every Year|year=2008|publisher=McFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers|isbn=978-0-7864-3229-5}}</ref>\n}}\n\n[[File:BuckBaker1949OldsmobileRocket.jpg|thumb|left|[[Buck Baker]]'s 1949 Oldsmobile Rocket 88 [[Stock car racing|stock car]]]]\n[[File:1949 Oldsmobile 88.jpg|thumb|left|1949 Oldsmobile 88]]\n[[File:1950 Oldsmobile Rockett 88 DE-93-36 p1.jpg|thumb|left|1950 Oldsmobile Rocket 88 Club Sedan]]\n[[File:Oldsmobile 88 Coupe (Centropolis Laval '10).jpg|thumb|left|1952 Oldsmobile 88 Holiday hardtop coupe]]\n[[File:Oldsmobile 88 dutch licence registration AL-44-98 pic5.JPG|thumb|left|1953 Oldsmobile Super 88 Convertible Coup\u00e9]]\n\n[[Oldsmobile]] introduced the 88 badge in 1949. It was named to complement the already-existing [[Oldsmobile Series 70|76]] and [[Oldsmobile 98|98]], and took the place of the [[Oldsmobile Straight-8 engine|straight-8 engined]] 78 in the model lineup. The new car used the same new Futuramic [[GM B platform|B-body]] platform as the [[Oldsmobile Straight-6 engine|straight-6 engined]] 76 but paired it with the new {{convert|303|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Oldsmobile V8 engine|Rocket V8 engine]] producing {{Convert|135|hp|kW|0}}. This combination of a relatively small light body and large, powerful engine made it widely considered to be the first [[muscle car]]. The Rocket 88 vaulted Oldsmobile from a somewhat staid, conservative car to a performer that became the one to beat on the [[NASCAR]] (National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing) circuits. It won six of the nine NASCAR late-model division races in 1949, 10 of 19 in 1950, 20 of 41 in 1952, and was eventually eclipsed by the low-slung, powerful [[Hudson Hornet]], but it was still the first real \"King of NASCAR.\"<ref>[http://www.canadiandriver.com/articles/bv/rocket88.htm Vance, Bill. \"1949 Oldsmobile \"Rocket\" 88\" Canadian Driver, October 19, 2004], retrieved on 2008-06-08.</ref> This led to increased sales to the public. There was a pent up demand for new cars in the fast-expanding post-[[World War II]] economy, and the 88 appealed to many ex-military personnel who were young and had operated powerful military equipment.\n\nThe 88 enjoyed great success, inspiring a popular 1950s slogan, \"Make a Date with a Rocket 88\", and also a song, \"[[Rocket 88]]\", often considered the [[first rock and roll record]]. Starting with the trunk-lid emblem of the 1950 model, Oldsmobile would adopt the rocket as its logo, and the 88 name would remain in the Olds lineup until the late 1990s, almost until the end of Oldsmobile itself.\n\nThe 1949 model was equipped with an ignition key and a starter push-button to engage the starter. Pushing the starter button would engage the starter, but if the ignition key was not inserted, unlocking the ignition, the car would not start. The car was equipped with an [[Air filter#Oil Bath|oil bath air cleaner]]. At the bottom edge of the front fender directly behind the front wheel was a badge that said \"Futuramic\" which identified an Oldsmobile approach to simplified driving, and the presence of an automatic transmission. V8 Oldsmobiles were automatic-only in 1949 as Oldsmobile lacked a manual gearbox that could handle the torque of the new engine.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m9_7lqg6Hc 1948 Oldsmobile Futuramic introduction] In 1950, Oldsmobile offered a modified Cadillac manual gearbox for V8 models. The 88 now outsold the six-cylinder 76 lineup, which was dropped entirely after the 1950 model year. It had a 40&nbsp;ft. turning circle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Oldsmobile/1950%20Oldsmobile/1950_Oldsmobile_Foldout/1950%20Oldsmobile%20Foldout-18.html |title=Directory Index: Oldsmobile/1950 Oldsmobile/1950_Oldsmobile_Foldout |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-08}}</ref> [[Hershel McGriff]] and Ray Elliot  won with the 1950 model won the [[1950 Carrera Panamericana]].\n\nFor 1951, the 88 was now the entry-level Olds with the discontinuation of the [[Straight-6|six-cylinder]] 76 line, which meant that all Oldsmobiles were powered by Rocket V8s. An in-house manual transmission replaced the modified Cadillac gearbox, but as the 1950s progressed, manual shift became increasingly rare in Oldsmobiles and normally could only be obtained by special order. New this year was the more upscale '''Super 88''' line on the new GM B-body<ref name=\"flory2008\"/> which included restyled rear body panels, a more luxurious interior, and a slightly longer {{convert|120|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase as opposed to the {{convert|119.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase which had been standard since the 88's introduction. The station wagon was discontinued and would not reappear until the 1957 model year. New was an I-beam frame. Hydraulic power windows and seats were optional.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Oldsmobile/1951%20Oldsmobile/1951_Oldsmobile_Foldout/1951%20Oldsmobile%20Foldout-18.html |title=Directory Index: Oldsmobile/1951 Oldsmobile/1951_Oldsmobile_Foldout |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-25}}</ref>\n\nIn 1952, the base 88 shared the Super 88's rear body panels and wheelbase, and came with a Rocket V8 and two-barrel [[carburetor]] while Super 88s came with a new four-barrel carburetor upping the output to {{Convert|160|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. Other mechanical features were unchanged with styling changes amounting to new grilles, taillights, and interior revisions. New was the optional automatic headlight control.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Oldsmobile/1952%20Oldsmobile/1952_Oldsmobile_Autronic_Eye_Foldout/1952%20Oldsmobile%20Autronic%20Eye%20Foldout-rear.html |title=Directory Index: Oldsmobile/1952 Oldsmobile/1952_Oldsmobile_Autronic_Eye_Foldout |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-25}}</ref>\n\nFor 1953, the base 88 was renamed the DeLuxe 88<ref name=\"flory2008\"/> for only this one year while the Super 88 continued as a more upscale version. Engines and transmission offerings were the same as 1952. Late in the 1953 model year, a fire destroyed GM's Hydra-Matic plant in [[Livonia, Michigan]], which was then the only source for Hydra-Matic transmissions. The temporary loss of Hydra-Matic production led Oldsmobile to build thousands of its 1953 models with Buick's two-speed Dynaflow automatic transmissions until GM pressed its [[Willow Run Transmission]] plant into service to resume Hydra-Matic production. New options this year included Frigidaire air conditioning, power steering, and power brakes.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Second generation (1954\u20131956) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name         = Second generation\n| image        = 1956 Oldsmobile 88.jpg\n| caption      = 1956 Oldsmobile Super 88 convertible\n| aka          = Oldsmobile Super 88\n| model_years  = 1954\u20131956\n| assembly     = {{unbulleted list|[[South Gate, California]]|[[Wilmington, Delaware]]|[[Doraville, Georgia]]|[[Kansas City, Kansas]]|[[Framingham, Massachusetts]]|[[Lansing, Michigan]]|[[Linden, New Jersey]]}}\n| body_style   = {{unbulleted list|2-door ''Holiday'' [[hardtop]]|2-door [[coupe]]|4-door ''Holiday'' hardtop|4-door [[Sedan (car)|sedan]]}}\n| layout       = [[Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout|FR layout]]\n| platform     = [[GM B platform|B-body]]\n| engine       = {{convert|324|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Oldsmobile V8 engine#324|Rocket]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]]\n| transmission = {{unbulleted list|3-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]]|4-speed ''[[Hydramatic|Hydra-Matic]]'' [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]}}\n| wheelbase    = {{convert|122.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"oldcarbrochures1954\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Oldsmobile/1954%20Oldsmobile/1954_Oldsmobile_Brochure_2/1954%20Oldsmobile-a30.html|title=Directory Index: Oldsmobile/1954 Oldsmobile/1954_Oldsmobile_Brochure_2|publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com|date= |accessdate=2012-01-08}}</ref>\n|length        = {{convert|205.26|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"oldcarbrochures1954\"/>\n}}\n\n[[File:Oldsmobile 88 1954 5310cc.jpg|thumb|left|1954 Oldsmobile 88 sedan]]\n[[File:Oldsmobile 88 Holiday sedan (1955) at Schaffen-Diest Fly-drive 2013.JPG|thumb|left|1955 Oldsmobile Super 88 Holiday hardtop coupe]]\n[[File:Oldsmobile 88 1955 - Falk\u00f6ping cruising 2014 - 6699.jpg|thumb|left|1955 Oldsmobile 88 sedan]]\n[[File:1956 Oldsmobile Super 88 Deluxe Sedan (CASM).jpg|thumb|left|1956 Oldsmobile Super 88 4-Door Sedan]]\n\nThe 1954 Oldsmobiles were completely restyled with new longer and lower body shells and wrap-around windshields and rear windows. Wheelbases increased to {{convert|122|in|m}}. Base models reverted to being simply called 88s after being designated as DeLuxe 88s for only one year and the Super 88 was once again the top series (beneath the larger [[Oldsmobile 98|98]]). The Rocket V8 was enlarged from 303 to 324 cubic inches with 88s powered by a two-barrel, {{convert|170|hp}} unit while Super 88s came with a {{convert|185|hp}} version with four-barrel carburetor.

Horsepower for the 324-cubic-inch Rocket V8 increased to 185 for 88s and 202 for Super 88s. At mid-year, Olds introduced the new pillarless four-door hardtop body, dubbed the Holiday sedan, in both the 88 and Super 88 series. The four-door Oldsmobile 88 Holiday, along with the four-door [[Oldsmobile 98|98 Holiday]], [[Buick Century|Buick Century Riviera]], and [[Buick Special|Special Riviera]], were the first four-door [[hardtop]]s ever produced.

A new four-speed Jetaway Hydra-Matic was introduced this year to replace the original Hydra-Matic transmission that Olds had used since 1940. The new Jetaway Hydra-Matic retained the four forward speeds and fluid coupling unit, but added a new \"Park\" position to the shift quadrant and no longer required band adjustment as a specified routine maintenance.

Also for 1957 the \"J2\" option was offered, with three {{convert|2|oilbbl|m3|sing=on}} carburetors, similar to the Pontiac Tri-Power. The Super 88 continued as the upscale mid-line series. Under the hood, the Rocket V8 increased in displacement to 371 cubic inches and {{convert|277|hp}} for all models across the board. Although rare, three speed manual transmissions were still available.  Styling highlights were more evolutional than radical overall with three-piece rear window styling utilized on some models. Oldsmobile revived station wagons for the first time since 1950 with the Super 88 Fiesta being a four-door hardtop design. In 1957, Oldsmobile added a safety deep-recessed steering wheel.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Oldsmobile/1957%20Oldsmobile/album/1957%20Oldsmobile-15.html |title=Directory Index: Oldsmobile/1957 Oldsmobile/album |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |accessdate=2012-01-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100905093324/http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Oldsmobile/1957%20Oldsmobile/album/1957%20Oldsmobile-15.html |archivedate=2010-09-05 }}</ref>\n\nFor 1958, GM was promoting their fiftieth year of production, and introduced Anniversary models for each brand; Cadillac, Buick, Oldsmobile, Pontiac, and Chevrolet.<ref>[http://www.gmphotostore.com/1958-Chevrolet-Impala-50th-Anniversary-Art-Poster/productinfo/P8367/ Image of 50th Anniversary promotional photo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017224216/http://www.gmphotostore.com/1958-Chevrolet-Impala-50th-Anniversary-Art-Poster/productinfo/P8367/ |date=2015-10-17 }}</ref> The 1958 models shared a common appearance on the top models for each brand; Cadillac Eldorado Seville, Buick Roadmaster Riviera, Oldsmobile Holiday 88, Pontiac Bonneville Catalina, and the all-new Chevrolet Bel-Air Impala.\n\nThe 1958 model is best known in Oldsmobile as the year of the \"ChromeMobile\" thanks to tremendous splatterings of chrome trim on the body, particularly on the higher-priced Super 88 and Ninety-Eight models. The styling was advertised by Olds as the \"Mobile Look.\" The '''Dynamic 88''' debuted in 1958 and lasted through 1966 positioned as the entry level model below the '''Super 88.''' This model featured a more economical Rocket V8 than its more expensive linemates \u2013 a de-tuned {{Convert|265|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} version of the 371 cubic-inch Rocket V8 with two-barrel carburation.

Oldsmobile was also way ahead of other middle-priced competitors such as sister division Pontiac, Mercury, Dodge and Chrysler, along with Ford Motor Company's all-new and ill-fated [[Edsel]], and Chrysler Corporation's [[DeSoto (automobile)|DeSoto]] - the latter two nameplates of which would fade into oblivion within the next three years.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Fourth generation (1959\u20131960) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name         = Fourth generation\n| image        = Oldsmobile Super 88 - Flickr - Alexandre Pr\u00e9vot.jpg\n| caption      = 1959 Oldsmobile Super 88 4-door Sedan\n| aka          = {{unbulleted list|Oldsmobile Rocket 88|Oldsmobile Dynamic 88|Oldsmobile Super 88}}\n| model_years  = 1959\u20131960\n| assembly     = {{unbulleted list|[[Doraville, Georgia]]|[[Baltimore, Maryland]]|[[South Gate, California]]|[[Kansas City, Kansas]]|[[Kansas City, Missouri]]|[[Fremont, California]]|[[Linden, New Jersey]]|[[Lansing, Michigan]]|[[Arlington, Texas]]}}\n| body_style   = {{unbulleted list|2-door ''Holiday'' [[hardtop]]|2-door [[coupe]]|2-door [[convertible (car)|convertible]]|4-door ''Holiday'' hardtop|4-door [[Sedan (car)|sedan]]|4-door [[station wagon]]}}\n| layout       = [[Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout|FR layout]]\n| platform     = [[GM B platform|B-body]]\n| related      = {{unbulleted list|[[Buick Lesabre]]|[[Pontiac Catalina]]}}\n| engine       = {{unbulleted list|{{convert|371|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Oldsmobile V8 engine#371|Rocket]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]]|{{convert|374|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Oldsmobile V8 engine#374|Rocket]]'' V8|{{convert|394|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Oldsmobile V8 engine#394|Rocket]]'' V8}}\n| transmission = {{unbulleted list|3-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]]|4-speed ''[[Hydramatic|Hydra-Matic]]'' [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]}}\n| wheelbase    = {{convert|123.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| length       = {{convert|217.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref>http://oldcarbrochures.org/index.php/New-Brochures---November/1960-Oldsmobile-Brochure-Cdn/1960-Oldsmobile-Cdn--30-31</ref>\n| width        = {{convert|80.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n}}\n\n[[File:Oldsmobile Super 88 1959 L\u00e4nsrundan.jpg|thumb|left|1959 Oldsmobile Super 88 Holiday Scenicoupe]]\n[[File:1959 Oldsmobile Super 88 (35381807842).jpg|thumb|left|1959 Oldsmobile Super 88 Holiday Sport Sedan]]\n[[File:1960 Oldsmobile 88 convertible.jpg|thumb|left|1960 Oldsmobile Dynamic 88 Convertible]]\n[[File:1960 Oldsmobile 88 (15257636257).jpg|thumb|left|1960 Oldsmobile Dynamic 88 Holiday Scenicoupe, rear view]]\n\nAll Oldsmobiles were completely restyled for 1959, with the 88 series given longer, lower and wider styling on a GM B-body chassis. The 88 shared its appearance with the top-model [[Oldsmobile 98]]. Styling highlights for the new models, promoted as the \"Linear Look,\" included six-window styling on four-door pillared sedans, glassy semi-fastback rooflines on Holiday coupes and flat-blade rooflines with thin windshield and C-pillars on Holiday sedans which created a large open greenhouse effect. Two-door hardtops were called \"Holiday Scenicoupes,\" whereas four-door hardtops were called \"Holiday Sport Sedans.\"  While many 1959 model cars featured bigger and sharper fins, Olds flattened theirs horizontally and reduced chrome from 1958 for a much cleaner look. Wheelbases on 88 models increased by one inch to {{convert|123|in|mm|0}}.\n\nA larger, 394 cubic-inch Rocket V8 with four-barrel carburation rated at {{Convert|315|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} was standard on the '''Super 88'''. The lower-priced '''Dynamic 88''' retained the two-barrel {{Convert|265|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 371 cubic-inch '57\u201358 Rocket V8, with a {{Convert|300|hp|kW|-1|abbr=on}} four-barrel version optional.\n\nA simpler but bold new grille and revised rear design with even flatter, horizontal tailfins and new taillights highlighted the 1960 makeover. Power for Super 88 models remained the same, while Dynamic 88s had their 371 ci Rocket V8 detuned to {{Convert|240|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, where a lower compression ratio accommodated lower-priced regular gasoline. Other changes included a revised instrument panel and a slimmer transmission tunnel for improved interior space.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Fifth generation (1961\u20131964) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name         = Fifth generation\n| image        = 1961 Oldsmobile Dynamic 88 Convertible (35232134240).jpg\n| caption      = 1961 Oldsmobile Dynamic 88 Convertible\n| model_years  = 1961\u20131964\n| assembly     = {{unbulleted list|[[Doraville, Georgia]]|[[Baltimore, Maryland]]|[[South Gate, California]]|[[Kansas City, Kansas]]|[[Kansas City, Missouri]]|[[Fremont, California]]|[[Linden, New Jersey]]|[[Lansing, Michigan]]|[[Arlington, Texas]]}}\n| layout       = [[Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout|FR layout]]\n| aka          = {{unbulleted list|Oldsmobile Dynamic 88|Oldsmobile Jetstar 88|Oldsmobile Super 88}}\n| body_style   = {{unbulleted list|2-door [[hardtop]]|2-door [[coupe]]|4-door hardtop|4-door [[Sedan (car)|sedan]]|4-door [[station wagon]]}}\n| platform     = [[GM B platform|B-body]]\n| related      = {{unbulleted list|[[Buick Invicta]]|[[Buick LeSabre]]|[[Buick Wildcat]]  |[[Pontiac Bonneville]]|[[Pontiac Catalina|Pontiac Catalina/Laurentian]]|[[Pontiac Parisienne]]|[[Chevrolet Bel Air]]|[[Chevrolet Impala]]}}\n| engine       = {{unbulleted list|{{convert|330|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Oldsmobile V8 engine#Jetfire Rocket|Jetfire Rocket]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]]|{{convert|394|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Oldsmobile V8 engine#Sky Rocket|Sky Rocket]]'' V8}}\n| transmission = {{unbulleted list|3-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]]|3-speed ''[[GM Roto Hydramatic|Roto Hydra-Matic]]'' [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]}}\n| wheelbase    = {{convert|123.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| length       = {{convert|214.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n}}\n\nAn all-new body and chassis with perimeter \"Guard Beam\" frame and all-coil suspension replacing the previous leaf springs highlighted the 1961 full-sized Oldsmobiles, which were joined by the new compact [[Oldsmobile F-85|F-85]]. All full-sized Oldsmobiles were now powered by the 394-cubic-inch Rocket V8 with the Dynamic 88 getting a two-barrel, {{convert|250|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} version that used regular gas, while the Super 88 was powered by a four-barrel \"Ultra High Compression\" 394 Skyrocket V8 rated at {{convert|325|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The Skyrocket engine was available as an extra-cost option on the Dynamic 88. A new three-speed \"Roto\" Hydra-matic transmission that was smaller and lighter than the previous four-speed unit was introduced as an option.\n\n[[File:1961 Oldsmobile Dynamic 88 (35257871770).jpg|thumb|left|1961 Oldsmobile Dynamic 88 Celebrity Sedan, rear view]]\nThe 1961 Oldsmobile body design represented the after-effect of the 1958 recession.  While wheelbases remained the same as in 1960, the overall length and width were reduced slightly \u2013 a trend seen throughout all of GM's marques.  Body design focused on a trimmer, fuselage design.  At the bottom of the rear quarters, a \"[[skeg]]\"\u2014a downward fin\u2014jutted outboard to counterbalance the rearward point of the quarter panel. Round tail lights, one on each side, were set into the rear cove. For 1961, GM retired the compound curve windshields that it introduced in 1954, and the much hated body dogleg necessitated by the shape of the windshield.  Instead of adopting the cleaner straight angled \"A\" pillar, Harley Earl, who was nearing the end of his tenure at GM, pushed for a small curved switch back, used in 1961\u201362, at the outboard base of the windshield.\n\nLike for the previous model year, there were six body styles: a 2-door sedan, the Celebrity Sedan 4-door sedan, the Holiday Sedan 4-door hardtop, the Holiday Coupe 2-door hardtop, the Convertible Coupe drop-top and the Fiesta station wagon, available in both 2- and 3-seat models. All body styles but the 2-door sedan (which was the price leader) were offered both as Dynamic 88 and Super 88. In general all models had thicker pillars than the extremely thin ones found on previous generation models. The Holiday Coupe 2-door hardtop continued the \"bubble top\" look. The 1961 Holiday Sedan 4-door hardtop had thicker, parallelogram-shaped rear pillar than its predecessor. The extreme \"floating roof\" look of the 1959\u20131960 4-door hardtop, with wrap-around panoramic rear window and overhanging roof, had been passed on to the pillared Celebrity Sedan\u2014which had switched from the previous year six-window to a four-window greenhouse. Six-window sedans continued to be offered in the [[Oldsmobile 98|98]] line.\n\nAt mid-year, a sporty and luxurious convertible called the [[Oldsmobile Starfire]] was introduced. It was based on the Super 88 ragtop and featured leather bucket seats, center console with floor shifter for the Hydra-matic transmission (incidentally the first U.S. full-sized production car to feature an automatic transmission with a console-mounted floor shifter) and many other standard items such as power steering, brakes, windows and driver's seat. The Starfire was also powered by an even higher-performance version of the \"Ultra High Compression\" 394-cubic-inch Starfire V8 rated at {{Convert|335|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.\n\n[[File:1962 Oldsmobile Super 88 (19020225312).jpg|thumb|left|1962 Oldsmobile Super 88 Holiday Coupe]]\n[[File:1962 Oldsmobile Super 88 Celebrity 4 door Sedan.jpg|thumb|left|1962 Oldsmobile Super 88 Celebrity Sedan]]\n[[File:Oldsmobile station wagon white.jpg|thumb|left|For 1962 the Oldsmobile Dynamic 88 Fiesta station wagon mostly retained the rear design of the 1961 model]]\nFor 1962, the Oldsmobile 88 received a \"second-year\" facelift that included a revised grille and front bumper. Length was increased somewhat to give the '62 Olds a longer look. Changes to the rear included the removal of the rear fender skegs (personally ordered by GM's Vice President of design [[Bill Mitchell (designer)|Bill Mitchell]], who disliked them), and oval taillights, one on each side for Dynamic and Super 88 models replaced the 1961's round units. 1962 Starfires received two oval lights per side, much like the concurrent Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight models. Changes to the greenhouse included new roof lines for the four-door Celebrity Sedan\u2014which relinquished the panoramic rear window\u2014and for the Holiday Coupe two-door hardtop, which received a new fashionable convertible-inspired roofline abandoning the \"bubble-top\" appearance. The two-door sedan, made redundant as entry-level model by the previous year's introduction of the [[Oldsmobile F-85|F-85]] compact, was discontinued. Lastly, the Fiesta station wagon was only partially restyled, retaining most of the 1961's rear styling; the 3-seat wagon was now only available as Dynamic 88.\n\nEngines were uprated to {{convert|280|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} for the standard engine in the Dynamic 88 thanks to a higher compression ratio that demanded the use of premium fuel (a regular-fuel {{convert|260|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} version was offered as a no-cost option), 330 horses for the \"Skyrocket\" V8 standard on Super 88 and Ninety-Eight and 345 horsepower for the top Starfire Rocket V8. Oldsmobile marketing continued to use the trade names of \"Roto-matic Power Steering\" and \"Pedal-eeze Power Brakes\".\nAll Oldsmobiles featured the \"speed bar\" speedometer. Introduced in 1959, the speedometer used a rolling black cylinder with sections painted brilliant green, yellow and bright red. As the car went from a standing stop forward in speed, the cylinder rolled, first exposing the green in a window that matched the numeric speed on stationary speed dial for low speeds, yellow at moderate speeds, and finally red at highway speeds. Drivers who topped the car over 100&nbsp;mph moved the cylinder into an area where only the black base color was visible. For 1963, Oldsmobile would revert to a standard speed needle sweeping over a calibrated set of speeds instead.\n\n1962 Oldsmobile Dynamic 88s and Dynamic 88 Fiesta wagons each had their own upholstery patterns in single and dual-tone colors. Super 88s received tri-tone upholstery and trim. Heaters became standard equipment on all models, and the push-button controls were located to the right of the steering wheel column. Vehicles not equipped with air conditioning received push-button vacuum-operated fresh air vents, called \"Summer Ventilation\", which replaced the pull level type vents.  This control panel was located on the left of the steering column.  Cars equipped with factory air conditioning replaced the vent control panel with the air conditioning panel, which also contained its own blower switch.  These cars also sported round dash vents for the delivery of A/C airflow. Dynamic 88s received aqua dashboard panel inserts with \"OLDSMOBILE\" lettering, while Super 88s received panels with that model's nomenclature on the insert.\n\nAll full-sized Oldsmobiles underwent extensive body and trim revisions for 1963. Most of the underlying basic body structure and rooflines were carried over from '62 with new exterior sheet metal abandoning the previous years' sculpted mid-sections; Lincoln Continental-style slab sides and sharper edges being employed overall. The Starfire gained an exclusive razor-edged roof treatment utilizing a concave backlight similar to that of the new Pontiac Grand Prix. Different rear quarter panels meant Oldsmobile 88s and the more expensive 98s were more differentiated than before. 1963 also brought about GM's across-the-board adoption of the straight angled windshield \"A\" pillar on all full-size production vehicles eliminating the unusual 1961 through 1962 reverse-curve treatment. Models and drivetrains in both the Dynamic 88 and Super 88 series were unchanged from 1962. Options that year included a \"tilt-away\" steering wheel that could be adjusted to six positions, six-way power seats, AM/FM radio and cruise control.<ref>http://oldcarbrochures.org/index.php/New-Brochures---April/1963-Oldsmobile-Full-Size-Owners-Manual/1963-Full-Size-Oldsmobile-Manual-32-33</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n| direction = vertical\n| image1    = 1964 Oldsmobile Jetstar 88, front left.jpg\n| image2    = 1964 Oldsmobile Jetstar 88, rear left.jpg\n| footer    = 1964 Oldsmobile Jetstar 88 Celebrity Sedan}}\nThe sharp-edged theme continued for 1964, Oldsmobile's full-sized cars received a minor face-lift that included revised trim, grilles and taillights. New that year was the introduction of price leader for the full-sized Oldsmobile series, the '''Jetstar 88''', which used the same full-size body as other 88 models but also shared key components with that year's redesigned [[Oldsmobile F-85|F-85]] [[Mid-size car|intermediate]]. The Jetstar 88 used the smaller [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#Jetfire Rocket|330 V8]] and Jetaway ([[Super Turbine 300]]) two-speed automatic transmission in place of the 394-cubic-inch V8 and [[Roto Hydramatic]] found in other Oldsmobiles, and 9.5-inch (241.3&nbsp;mm) [[drum brake]]s which were less effective than the {{convert|11|in|mm|0|sing=on}} drums found on other full-sized Olds models.\n\nOldsmobile also introduced the [[Oldsmobile Jetstar I|Jetstar I]] for 1964. Not part of the Jetstar 88 line, the Jetstar I instead was a direct competitor to the [[Pontiac Grand Prix]] in the same $3,500 price range. Jetstar I's shared the [[notchback]] body style with the [[Oldsmobile Starfire|Starfire]] along with its more powerful {{convert|345|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 394-cubic-inch Rocket V8 engine, but with less standard equipment and a lower price tag. Oddly, Oldsmobile teamed the {{convert|345|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} Rocket engine with a very unsuitable transmission in the Jetstar I, the Jetaway ([[Super Turbine 300]]) two-speed unit with \"switch pitch\" converter.\n\nWith the introduction of the Jetstar 88, the Dynamic 88 models were elevated a rung up the ladder for the 1964 model year. Only the Dynamic 88s could be in five body styles: four-door pillared Celebrity Sedan and hardtop Holiday Sedan, two-door hardtop Holiday Coupe, convertible and 2- or 3-seat Fiesta station wagon. The Jetstar 88 didn't offer a station wagon.\n\n1964 was the last for the Super 88 series, which was limited to the two four-door body styles\u2014the Celebrity Sedan and Holiday Sedan. Total production for both four-door Super 88 models reached 19,514 assemblies for the model year.\n\n[[File:1964 Oldsmobile Dynamic 88 Fiesta station wagon, rear left side.jpg|thumb|1964 Oldsmobile Dynamic 88 Fiesta station wagon]]\n1964 was also the last year for Oldsmobile to offer full-sized station wagons until the 1971 model year. Oldsmobile's full-size Fiesta wagons (and Buick's Estate Wagons) introduced in 1957 had never been strong sellers. From 1960 to 1963, production per model (Super or Dynamic) and seating capacity (six or nine passenger) never broke 15,000 units. The wagons' bodies weren't made by Fisher Body, but were instead farmed out to Ionia Manufacturing Company of Ionia, Michigan. As Oldsmobile set its sights on more luxury and performance, full-sized wagons weren't in the mix. The division introduced a new Vista Cruiser wagon in mid-1964 that featured a raised roofline and skylights over the rear seat and cargo area. The models were offered with six- or nine-passenger seating with all seats facing forward. The Vista Cruiser used a six-inch (152&nbsp;mm) stretched wheelbase version of the intermediate F-85/Cutlass. This allowed Oldsmobile (and Buick, which used the same body and stretch wheelbase for its Sport Wagon) to offer a wagon comparable in overall size to the full-sized Chevrolet Impala and Pontiac Catalina wagons, but without diluting the cachet of its full-size cars with a utilitarian body style.\n\n== Sixth generation (1965\u20131970) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name         = Sixth generation\n| image        = 1965 Oldsmobile Dynamic 88 (19651481130).jpg\n| caption      = 1965 Oldsmobile Dynamic 88 Holiday Coupe\n| aka          = {{unbulleted list|Oldsmobile Jetstar 88|Oldsmobile Dynamic 88|Oldsmobile Delta 88|Oldsmobile Delmont 88}}\n| model_years  = 1965\u20131970\n| assembly     = {{unbulleted list|[[Fremont, California]]|[[Doraville, Georgia]]|[[Fairfax, Kansas]]|[[Framingham, Massachusetts]]|[[Lansing, Michigan]]|[[Linden, New Jersey]]|[[Arlington, Texas]]}}\n| layout       = [[Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout|FR layout]]\n| platform     = [[GM B platform|B-body]]\n| related      = {{unbulleted list|[[Buick LeSabre]]|[[Buick Wildcat]] |[[Pontiac Bonneville]]|[[Pontiac Catalina|Pontiac Catalina/Laurentian]]|[[Pontiac Parisienne]]|[[Chevrolet Bel Air]]|[[Chevrolet Caprice]]|[[Chevrolet Impala]]}}\n| body_style   = {{unbulleted list|2-door [[hardtop]]|2-door [[convertible (car)|convertible]]|4-door hardtop|4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]}}\n| engine       = {{unbulleted list|{{convert|330|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Oldsmobile V8 engine#Jetfire Rocket|Jetfire Rocket]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]]|{{convert|350|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Oldsmobile V8 engine#350|Rocket 350]]'' V8|{{convert|425|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Oldsmobile V8 engine#Super Rocket|Super Rocket]]'' V8|{{convert|455|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Oldsmobile V8 engine#455|Rocket 455]]'' V8}}\n| transmission = {{unbulleted list|3-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]|3-speed automatic|4-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]]|3-speed manual transmission}}\n| wheelbase    = {{unbulleted list|1965\u201368: {{convert|123.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}|1969\u201370: {{convert|124.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}}}\n}}\n\nThe '''Delta''' name in 1965 was an upscale trim line of the Dynamic 88, the '''Dynamic 88 Delta''', replacing the previous top-series B-body Olds, the '''Super 88'''.

The B-body cars featured more rounded styling than previous years with [[Coke bottle styling|Coke-bottle]] profiles and semi-fastback rooflines on Holiday (two-door hardtop) coupes - Jetstar I and Starfire coupes got a more rounded variation of the squared-off 1963\u201364 roofline with concave rear window shared by Pontiac's Grand Prix.\nAlso introduced this year was a new 425 cubic-inch Super Rocket V8 with horsepower ratings ranging from 300 to 370 depending on carburation and compression ratio. The new three-speed [[Turbo Hydramatic]] transmission with torque converter replaced the [[GM Roto Hydramatic transmission|Roto Hydramatic]] used since 1961. Also new to the option list for 1965 on all B-body cars was a four-speed [[manual transmission]] with Hurst floor shifter, which was a seldom-ordered offering.\n\n[[File:1966 Oldsmobile Delta 88 Holiday hardtop 4-door sedan.jpg|thumb|left|1966 Oldsmobile Delta 88 Holiday Sedan]]\nFew styling changes other than revised grilles and tail sections marked the 1966 full-sized Oldsmobiles. The sporty Jetstar I series was dropped with a lower-priced Starfire only offered as a hardtop coupe taking its place. All other series' 88 models were carried over from 1965 with a new convertible added to the Delta 88 line and the same bodystyle dropped from the Jetstar 88 line.\n\nA new option for all senior Oldsmobiles (88, Ninety-Eight and the new front-drive [[Oldsmobile Toronado|Toronado]]) was GM's automatic Comfortron Air Conditioning system first introduced by Cadillac in 1964. Comfortron permitted the driver to automatically set a year-round temperature at a constant level. The basic Frigidaire air conditioning unit offered in previous years continued as before and becoming an increasingly popular option on full-sized Oldsmobiles. Another new option for 1966 was a Tilt-and-Telescopic steering wheel that could be vertically adjusted to six different positions as well as telescoped outward from the instrument panel to improve driver comfort.\n\n[[File:1967 Oldsmobile Delta 88 HT sedan, Castle Hedingham 2008.jpg|thumb|left|1967 Oldsmobile Delta 88 Holiday Sedan]]\n[[File:1967 Oldsmobile Delta 88 coupe rear.jpg|thumb|left|1967 Oldsmobile Delta 88 Custom Holiday Coupe, rear view]]\nFor 1967, all GM full-size cars received a mid cycle freshening that featured fuller body panels. More rounded styling cues marked all 1967 Olds 88 models which received longer hoods and shorter decks and more sweeping fastback rooflines on 88 Holiday coupes to emulate the styling of Olds' front-wheel-drive flagship, the Toronado.  Olds 88's received a three part front grille made op of a center prow flanked on either side by headlight pods.  For the first time since 1959, the dual headlights were split apart by parking lights.  Taillights for 88's featured a waterfall design. Interiors made extensive use of wood-tone panels, and bright metal finishes were kept to a minimum.\n\nModel wise, there was more name juggling. The '''Delmont 88''' was introduced for 1967 and produced for just two years, replacing both the Jetstar 88 and Dynamic 88 model lines. The Delmont featured the [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#Jetfire Rocket|330 V8]] as standard and the [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#425|425 V8]] as an option in 1967 and the new stroked \"Rocket 455\" version of the same engine in 1968. The 425 was standard on the Delta 88. The Delta 88 gained a new sub series called the '''Delta 88 Custom''' which had a plusher interior than the standard Delta 88 featuring a Strato bench seat in the Holiday Sedan (four-door hardtop) or, in the Holiday Soupe (two-door hardtop), a choice of either Strato bucket seats with console or Strato bench seat with armrest. The Delta Custom Holiday Coupe was essentially a successor to the former 88-based [[Oldsmobile Starfire|Starfire]] series offered in previous years (1961\u201366) but with a standard 88 semi-fastback roofline rather than the Starfire's squared off roof with concave rear window.  Another styling cue for the Delta Custom was the addition of a second set of tail light reflectors set into the lower portion of the bumper.\n\nNew options for 1967 included front disc brakes, stereo [[8-track tape|8-track]] tape player and a Climate Combustion Control system for Rocket V8s designed to regulate carburetor air temperature, boost fuel economy, speed choke warm up and eliminate winter icing to permit easier starting and more efficient operation in cold weather.\n\nThe same assortment of 330 and 425 cubic-inch V8 engines were carried over from 1966, as were most transmission offerings except the optional four-speed manual with Hurst shifter, which was discontinued due to low buyer interest.\n\n[[File:1968 Oldsmobile Delta 88 Holiday Coupe.jpg|thumb|left|1968 Oldsmobile Delta 88 Holiday Coupe]]\nFor 1968, the overall design was a carry over.  New front end with split grille design that would become an Olds trademark in coming years highlighted all 1968 full-sized Oldsmobiles with horizontal lines on 88's and egg-crate patterns on Ninety-Eights, along with concealed windshield wipers.\n \nThe Delmont 88 got a larger 350 cubic-inch V8 as standard equipment and the optional V8 that was standard on Delta 88/Custom and Ninety-Eight was jacked up to 455 cubic inches with a {{Convert|390|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} W-33 option primarily designed as part of the division's police package available as an RPO on all 88's. Horsepower ratings of other Olds engines included 250 for the 350 two-barrel standard in the Delmont 88, 310 for the four-barrel 350 optional in the Delmont 88. A 455 two-barrel rated at {{convert|310|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} was standard on the Delta 88/Custom and optional on the Delmont 88. Optional on all 88s was a four-barrel 455 rated at {{convert|365|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} from the larger C-body Ninety-Eight. Both the 350 and 455 two-barrel Rocket V8 engines were designed to use regular gasoline while the optional 350 and 455 four-barrel carburated \"Ultra High Compression\" Super Rocket V8s required premium fuel.\n\n{{multiple image\n| direction = vertical\n| image1    = 69 Oldsmobile Delta 88 Royale (14529793202).jpg\n| image2    = 69 Oldsmobile Delta 88 Royale (14344226068).jpg\n| footer    = 1969 Oldsmobile Delta 88 Royale}}\nThe 1969 88 series dropped the Delmont name, leaving the Delta 88 as the base model of the series. The '''Delta 88 Royale''' trim, only available on a Holiday Coupe, was added as line-topper above the Delta 88 Custom. It came standard with a more luxurious interior featuring a notchback vinyl upholstered bench seat with armrest or Strato bucket seats with optional center console. For safety, a ceiling mounted shoulder belt was offered in the front seats for both the driver and right passenger. This arrangement provided five belt buckles in the front bench seat. The standard engine in the base Delta 88 was a 350 cu in, low compression ratio (9.0:1) Rocket V8 with a Rochester two-barrel carburetor that was rated at {{convert|250|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4,600&nbsp;rpm and {{convert|355|lb\u00b7ft|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque ran on leaded regular 94 RON gasoline. Standard on the Delta 88 Custom and Royale models and optional on the base series was a low compression two-barrel version of the 455 cubic-inch Rocket V8 rated at {{Convert|310|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} designed to use regular fuel. Optional on all Delta 88s was the four-barrel Ultra High Compression 455 cubic-inch Super Rocket V8 rated at {{Convert|365|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. Top option was the {{Convert|390|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} version of the four-barrel 455 V8 designed to run on 98 RON octane fuel available in all Delta 88 models as the W-33 option.\n\nThe two-speed Jetaway automatic that was previously offered as an option on the smaller engine 88 models was dropped completely in favor of the GM three-speed Turbo Hydra-Matic 400 transmission previously only offered with the larger engines. Also a new GM-designed Variable-Ratio Power Steering system was introduced as an option.\n\nAll full-sized Oldsmobiles were completely restyled for 1969 with more squared off bodylines and rooflines for the Holiday coupes and sedans replacing the semi-fastback look of 1967\u201368, and ventless front windows on all models. Wheelbases were increased by one-inch to {{convert|124|in|m}}. Though the 1969 models were extensively restyled, the basic 1965 chassis design and inner-body structure was retained along with the roofline on the pillared four-door Town sedans.\n\nInside, headrests were now standard equipment and a new instrument panel included square instruments replacing the round instruments of previous years along with a push-button operated ashtray and rotary glove compartment knob, as well as heating/air conditioning controls relocated from the center of the dash to the left of the steering wheel near the lights and wiper switches. The high-beam lights indicator was a red rocket located on the dash. Also new was a steering column-mounted ignition switch that also locked the steering wheel when not in use \u2013 a feature found on all 1969-model General Motors passenger cars, a year before locking steering columns were required by federal mandate starting in 1970.\n\n[[File:1970 Oldsmobile Delta 88 front.jpg|thumb|left|1970 Oldsmobile Delta 88 Town Sedan]]\nOnly detail changes were made for the 1970 full-sized Oldsmobiles including a new split grille that no longer extended to surround the headlights and a slightly revised rear section. Powertrain selections were carried over from 1969 with both 350 and 455 cubic-inch Rocket V8s now featuring \"Positive Valve Rotators\" for longer engine life and more efficient operation. A new antenna impregnated into the windshield was introduced this year that replaced the previous fender-mounted unit and was included as standard equipment on all cars equipped with a factory radio. New option this year was a wiper/washer switch mounted in the shift lever knob.  Optional radio was a stereo AM-FM radio and a lower dash mounted eight track tape player.\n\nThe 1965\u20131970 [[GM B platform]] is the fourth best selling automobile platform in history after the [[Volkswagen Beetle]], [[Ford Model T]] and the [[Lada Riva]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== Seventh generation (1971\u20131976) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name         = Seventh generation\n| image        = 1972 Oldsmobile Delta 88.jpg\n| caption      = 1972 Oldsmobile Delta 88 hardtop sedan\n| aka          = {{unbulleted list|Oldsmobile Delta 88|[[Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser]]}}\n| model_years  = 1971\u20131976\n| assembly     = {{unbulleted list|[[Fremont, California]]|[[Fairfax, Kansas]]|[[Framingham, Massachusetts]]|[[Lansing, Michigan]]|[[Linden, New Jersey]]|[[Arlington, Texas]]}}\n| body_style   = {{unbulleted list|2-door [[hardtop]]|2-door [[convertible]]|4-door hardtop|4-door [[Sedan (car)|sedan]]}}\n| layout       = [[Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout|FR layout]]\n| platform     = [[GM B platform|B-body]]\n| engine       = {{unbulleted list|{{convert|350|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Oldsmobile V8 engine|Rocket 350]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]]|{{convert|455|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Oldsmobile V8 engine#455|Rocket 455]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]]}}\n| related      = {{unbulleted list|[[Cadillac Deville]]|[[Buick LeSabre]] |[[Pontiac Bonneville]]|[[Pontiac Catalina|Pontiac Catalina/Laurentian]]|[[Pontiac Parisienne]]|[[Chevrolet Bel Air]]|[[Chevrolet Caprice]]|[[Chevrolet Impala]]}}\n| transmission = {{unbulleted list|3-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]|3-speed automatic|3-speed manual transmission}}\n| wheelbase    = {{convert|124.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n}}\n\n[[File:1971 Oldsmobile Delta 88 sedan.jpg|thumb|left|1971 Oldsmobile Delta 88 sedan]]\n[[File:Oldsmobile Delta 88 Royale convertible -- 07-03-2011 2.jpg|thumb|left|1972 Oldsmobile Delta 88 convertible]]\n[[File:1972 Oldsmobile Delta 88 Royale pic3.JPG|thumb|left|1972 Oldsmobile Delta 88 Royale convertible interior]]\n[[File:1972 Oldsmobile Delta 88 Royale Holiday Coupe (Centropolis Laval '10).jpg|thumb|left|1972 Oldsmobile Delta 88 Royale Holiday hardtop coupe]]\n[[File:Oldsmobile Delta 88 convertible.jpg|thumb|left|1973 Oldsmobile Delta 88 Royale convertible]]\n[[File:'75 Oldsmobile Convertible (Bagnoles au bord de l'eau '12).JPG|thumb|left|1975 Oldsmobile Delta 88 Royale convertible]]\n\nAll GM B-body full-size cars were completely restyled and enlarged for 1971, but continued to ride on a {{convert|124|in|mm|0|sing=on}} wheelbase. It reached its maximum size in 1974 at an astounding {{convert|226.9|in|mm|0|sing=on}} in length.  It was available as a pillared four-door Town Sedan, two-door and four-door Holiday hardtops and a convertible. Series models for 1971 included the base Delta 88, Delta 88 Custom and Delta 88 Royale, the latter inheriting the convertible body style previously offered on the base Delta 88. All models received fuselage styling somewhat similar to what Chrysler Corporation introduced on its 1969 models, and new rooflines with a more squared off greenhouse for Town sedans and more rounded lines for Holiday sedans and coupes \u2013 the latter receiving reverting to a semi-fastback format.\n\nAlso new for 1971 was the [[Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser|Custom Cruiser]] station wagon, the first full-sized Oldsmobile wagon since 1964. It used the 88's B-body platform with a longer {{convert|127|in|mm|adj=on}} wheelbase (matching the larger C-body Ninety-Eight) with multi-leaf spring suspensions that differed entirely from the all-coil suspensions used in sedans and coupes. The Custom Cruiser came standard with the larger 455 Rocket V8 and utilized the disappearing clamshell tailgate of other full-size GM wagons.\n\nEngine offerings again included 350 and 455-cubic-inch Rocket V8s ranging from 250 to 340 gross horsepower, all of which featured lowered compression ratios beginning in 1971 to enable use of lower octane regular leaded 91 RON octane, low-lead or unleaded gasoline. Vented power front disc brakes and variable-ratio power steering were now standard equipment on all 88 models. During the 1971 model year, the Turbo Hydra-matic 400 transmission was added to the standard equipment list.\n\nOther highlights for 1971 included a wrap-around instrument panel shared with Ninety-Eight and Toronado models (Toronados had a slightly smoother upper leading edge design) that was highlighted by a large square speedometer and all controls within easy reach of the driver, and a one-year only Flo-Through ventilation system that utilized vents in the trunklid. The system used on all GM B-, C- and E-body cars and the [[Chevrolet Vega]], used the heater fan to draw air into the car from the cowl intake, and force it out through vents in the trunk lid or tailgate. In theory, passengers could enjoy fresh air even when the car was moving slowly or stopped, as in heavy traffic. In practice, however, it didn't work.\n\n1971 was the last model year in which a 3-speed manual transmission was offered on full-sized Oldsmobiles; the rarely-ordered option was dropped in 1972.\n\nWithin weeks of the 1971 models' debut, however, Oldsmobile\u2014and all other GM dealers\u2014received multiple complaints from drivers who complained the ventilation system pulled cold air into the car before the heater could warm up\u2014and could not be shut off. The ventilation system was extensively revised for 1972.\n\nFor 1972, the Delta Custom series was dropped and the Royale series was expanded to include four-door Town and Holiday sedans. Advertised brake horsepower figures dropped to 155 for the base 350 two-barrel and 250 for the optional 455 four-barrel Rocket V8s thanks to an industry-wide switch in power measurements from the previous gross method (as measured by a dynamometer with no accessories attached) to the net method in which the power measurements were based upon an engine \"as installed\" in a vehicle with all emission controls and accessories hooked up. Only minor trim changes were made this year that included revised \"waterfall\" grilles in front and four-segment taillights in the rear. Inside a revised \"Flo-Through\" ventilation system utilizing vents in the [[doorjamb]]s replaced the 1971 version which utilized vents in the trunklid.\n\nFor 1973, wider and lower split waterfall grilles flanked a new federally mandated {{convert|5|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} front bumper on all Delta 88 models and larger one-piece rounded rectangular taillights replaced the four-segmented lights of 1972. Engine offerings included a standard 350 Rocket V8 with two-barrel carburetor (150 net horsepower) or optional 455 Rocket V8 with four-barrel carburetion and {{Convert|215|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} with single exhaust or {{Convert|250|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} with dual exhausts. Model offerings were the same as 1972 with the Delta 88 Royale series now including the sole Olds convertible offering following the demise of the intermediate Cutlass Supreme convertible after 1972.\n\nDirector [[Sam Raimi]] regularly includes a 1973 Delta 88 in his films. Referred to as \"The Classic\" by the filmmaker, the car originally belonged to his parents and has made an appearance in the ''[[Evil Dead]]'' trilogy, his ''[[Spider-Man in film|Spider-Man]]'' films with [[Tobey Maguire]], and ''[[Drag Me To Hell]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Drees|first1=Rich|title=The Classic: Sam Raimi And The 1973 Oldsmobile Delta 88|url=http://www.filmbuffonline.com/FBOLNewsreel/wordpress/2013/04/09/the-classic-sam-raimi-and-the-1973-oldsmobile-delta-88/|website=FilmBuffOnline|accessdate=12 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1974, a {{convert|5|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} rear bumper was added and taillights reverted to a four-segment design similar to 1972 and the front grilles were narrowed and raised to hood level similar to 1971\u201372 models. Also, new rooflines were featured on Holiday hardtop coupes with large fixed triangular side windows in the widened \"C\" pillar.  Unlike the big Chevrolet formal-roof coupes, the Olds retained a small roll-down rear window.  As Oldsmobile completely discontinued two-barrel carbureted engines this year, a new 350 four-barrel Rocket V8 (175 horsepower) became standard equipment with the 455 available as an option. Other highlights this year included an all-new flat instrument panel shared with Ninety-Eight and Toronado models with horizontal sweep speedometer and \"Message Center\" system of warning lights replacing the wrap-around dash of previous years. A new and seldom-ordered option available on all full-sized Olds models and Toronados was a driver's-side airbag \u2013 among the first to be offered in a production automobile. The Delta 88 Royale ragtop was again the only convertible offered by Olds.\n\nDetail changes for 1975 included revised grilles and taillights along with new rear quarter windows for pillared and Holiday sedans \u2013 the latter's design similar to an opera window in September 1974. The same assortment of 350 and 455-cubic-inch Rocket V8s were still offered along with a one-year-only (and seldom-ordered) option of a Pontiac-built 400-cubic-inch V8 with two-barrel carburetor and {{convert|170|hp}} rating. All engines were hooked up to a catalytic converter that not only mandated the use of unleaded gasoline but also spelled the end of dual exhaust systems. 1975 was the final year for the Delta 88 Royale convertible, the last of which was built on July 11, 1975. Just under 7200 Delta 88 Royale convertibles were built in 1975 as Oldsmobile made a concerted effort to target the convertible buyer market at the time. The headline on a print ad for a 1975 Olds Delta 88 Royale convertible stated, \"Today a beautiful Olds convertible. Tomorrow, a collector's item\". The featured car in the ad was a red Delta 88 Royale rag top.\n\nFor 1976, the final year of this generation, all Olds 88s received revised grille work, rectangular headlamps and parking lamps directly below instead of in the bumper, with Delta 88 Royale models also getting spring-loaded stand-up hood ornaments. It was also the final year for the Holiday hardtop coupes and sedans, along with the 455 Rocket V8 and the optional airbag system that would generally become universal on production cars and trucks some 15 years later. A one-year only option on Delta 88 Royale Holiday coupes was the Royale Crown Landau package that included a stainless steel roof bar, padded rear quarter vinyl roof, special hood ornament and color-keyed wheelcovers.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== Eighth generation (1977\u20131985) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name         = Eighth generation\n| image        = 81delta88.jpg\n| caption      = 1981 Oldsmobile Delta 88 sedan\n| aka          = Oldsmobile Delta 88\n| model_years  = 1977\u20131985\n| assembly     = {{unbulleted list|[[South Gate, California]]|[[Fairfax, Kansas]]|[[Lansing, Michigan]]|[[Detroit Assembly|Detroit, Michigan]]}}\n| body_style   = {{unbulleted list|2-door [[coupe]]|4-door [[Sedan (car)|sedan]]}}\n| layout       = [[Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout|FR layout]]\n| platform     = [[GM B platform|B-body]]\n| related      = {{unbulleted list|[[Buick Estate]]|[[Buick LeSabre]]|[[Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser]]|[[Oldsmobile 98]]|[[Pontiac Bonneville]]|[[Pontiac Catalina|Pontiac Catalina/Laurentian]]|[[Pontiac Parisienne]]|[[Pontiac Safari]]|[[Chevrolet Caprice]]|[[Chevrolet Impala]]}}\n| engine       = {{unbulleted list|{{convert|231|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Buick V6 engine#231|Buick 231]]'' [[V6 engine|V6]]|{{convert|260|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Oldsmobile V8 engine#260|LV8]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]]|{{convert|307|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Oldsmobile V8 engine#LV2|LV2]]'' V8|{{convert|350|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Oldsmobile V8 engine#L34|L34]]'' V8|{{convert|350|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Chevrolet small-block engine#LM1|LM1]]'' V8|{{convert|350|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Oldsmobile Diesel engine|LF9]]'' V8|{{convert|403|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Oldsmobile V8 engine#403|Olds 403]]'' V8}}\n| transmission = {{unbulleted list|3-speed ''[[Turbo-Hydramatic#THM350|TH350]]'' automatic|3-speed ''[[Turbo-Hydramatic#THM200|TH200]]'' automatic|4-speed ''[[Turbo-Hydramatic#200-4R|THM 200-4R]]'' automatic}}\n| wheelbase    = {{convert|116.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| length       = {{unbulleted list|{{convert|217.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (1977\u201379)|{{convert|218.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (1980\u201385)<ref>{{cite book|title=World Cars 1982|publisher=Herald Books|isbn=0-910714-14-2}}</ref>}}\n| width        = {{convert|76.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| height       = {{unbulleted list|{{convert|55.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (coupe)|{{convert|55.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (sedan)}}\n}}\n\n[[File:Oldsmobile Delta 88 Coupe.JPG|thumb|left|1977 Oldsmobile Delta 88 coupe]]\n[[File:1983 Olds Delta 88 Royale.jpg|thumb|left|1983 Oldsmobile Delta 88 Royale sedan, rear view]]\n[[File:1984 Oldsmobile Royale 88, Dutch licence registration 67-LKP-9 p4.JPG|thumb|left|1984 Oldsmobile Delta 88 Royale hood emblem]]\n\nThe 1977 Delta 88s and other GM B-body cars were considerably downsized from their predecessors in length and wheelbase ({{convert|116|in|mm|abbr=on}} \u2013 the same as the four-door 1973\u201377 A-body Cutlass Sedan) and nearly {{convert|900|lb|abbr=on}} lighter in weight, with curb weights dropping to between {{convert|3500|and|3600|lb|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} depending on model.<ref name='77Specs'>{{cite book |title=1977 Oldsmobile Specs Book |publisher=[[Oldsmobile|Oldsmobile Motor Division]] |date=August 1976 |location=Lansing, Michigan}}</ref> Other than a reduction in shoulder room, however, interior room was not adversely affected; in fact, headroom and rear seat legroom increased. Both base Delta 88 and Royale models were now only offered in two pillared body styles; a two-door coupe and a four-door Town Sedan. The 1977\u20131979 '''[[Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser|Custom Cruiser]]''' was now based on the Delta 88's B-body rather than the Ninety-Eight's C-body (thus also sharing the coil spring suspension, rather than the multi-[[leaf spring]]) and came with a two-way tailgate rather than the clamshell of 1971\u201376 models. A fuel economy gauge was optional.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Oldsmobile/1977%20Oldsmobile/1977_Oldsmobile_Full_Size_Brochure/1977%20Oldsmobile%20Full%20Size-23.html |title=1977 Oldsmobile Sales Brochure, Full-size Cars |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-08}}</ref>\n\nThe standard engine was now a {{convert|231|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V6 engine|Buick V6]] with a [[Turbo-Hydramatic#THM200|Turbo-Hydramatic 200]] [[automatic transmission]].<ref name='77Service'>{{cite book |title=1977 Oldsmobile Service Manual |publisher=[[Oldsmobile|Oldsmobile Motor Division]] |year=1977 |location=Lansing, Michigan}}</ref> An [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#260|Oldsmobile 260]] was the base V8, followed by either a Chevrolet 350 (option code LM1) or Oldsmobile 350 (option code L34). Initially, the Oldsmobile engine came in California and high-altitude cars, the Chevrolet engine came in cars with Federal emissions equipment.<ref name='77Specs'/> The Olds engine returned later in the model year. Oldsmobile's new 403 was the top engine option and came with a [[Turbo-Hydramatic#THM350|THM350]] transmission.\n\nThe use of a Chevrolet engine caused a situation known as the \"Chevy-mobile\" affair. GM settled with some Oldsmobile owners by offering them warranty extensions for the Chevrolet-engined Oldsmobiles, or the option of returning those cars in exchange for an Oldsmobile with a genuine Rocket V8. The \"return car\" option wasn't commonly chosen, because the owner had to pay GM for mileage driven, which could become expensive. This began the era of \"corporate\" engines, and for many years GM advertisements would include a disclaimer stating '\"Oldsmobiles (or other divisions) are equipped with engines manufactured by various GM divisions, subsidiaries and affiliates worldwide.\"'\n\nAs in previous years, base Delta 88 and Royale models differed mainly in exterior and interior trim. Base Deltas had a full bench seat available in cloth-and-vinyl or all-vinyl upholstery, while Royales had a notchback bench seat with armrest or optional 60/40 notchback bench, also available in cloth-and-vinyl or all-vinyl trim. All 88s featured an all-new instrument panel with a horizontal sweep speedometer and heater/air conditioning controls moved to the center of the dash above the radio from the left side of the dash, and continued with the \"Message Center\" bank of warning lights. The new dash was highlighted with woodgrain trim. The dimmer switch moved from the floor to the turn-signal lever.\n\nFor 1978, a '''Holiday 88''' coupe was added to the lineup, featuring Strato bucket seats along with console and floor shifter, Super Stock wheels and two-tone paint schemes. All 88 models received new grilles and revised taillights with drivetrains the same as 1977 except for the addition of the 350 Diesel V8 to the option list.\n\nThe 1979 model year saw the addition of a new Delta 88 Royale Brougham series added to the line, which included plush \"pillowed\" seat trim similar to the Ninety-Eight. All models again received revised grilles and other minor changes. It was the last year for the 403 [[V8 engine|V8]] as federal fuel-economy mandates spelled the end of larger engines in order to meet those requirements.\n\nFor 1980, all 88s got new and more aerodynamic sheetmetal for improved fuel economy highlighted by rounded square taillights similar to mid-70s 88s, but overall dimensions stayed the same and coupes received a revised roofline. New to the engine lineup was the {{convert|307|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} Rocket V8 with four-barrel carburetor and {{convert|150|hp}}. All other engines except the now-discontinued 403 were carried over from 1979.\n\nOnly minor grille and taillight lens revisions highlighted the 1981 Delta 88s. The gasoline 350 Rocket V8 was dropped from the option list, leaving only the diesel version available. All other engines including the Buick 231 V6 and Oldsmobile 260 and 307 Rocket V8s were continued. All gasoline engines received GM's new '''Computer Command Control''' engine management system. This system was the forerunner of today's [[OBD-II]] which is standard on all cars sold in the United States. The system read various parameters such as vehicle speed, throttle position, engine speed, coolant temperature, and the oxygen content of the exhaust to provide the correct air/fuel mixture for any given driving condition. Also new for 1981 was GM's [[Turbo-Hydramatic#200-4R|Turbo-Hydramatic 200-4R]] transmission, which added an overdrive gear and torque converter clutch (TCC) to contribute to fuel economy and engine longevity. The sporty Holiday 88 coupe was offered for the last time this year.\n\nThe 1982 model year saw only minor trim changes for Delta 88, Royale and Royale Brougham models. The same assortment of engines/transmissions were carried over from previous years though the small 260 V8 was offered for the last time. For 1983, all Oldsmobile 88s received new grilles, hood ornaments and minor trim revisions including new steering wheels. This would be the last year for the base Delta 88 line, leaving only the Royale and Royale Brougham after this year. Engine offerings were down to three, a standard Buick 231 cubic-inch [[V6]], or optional Oldsmobile V8s including the 307 Rocket and 350 Diesel.\n\nFor 1984, all Delta 88s were now '''Royale''' or '''Royale Brougham''' models. Styling highlights included new grille inserts and red and amber taillights replacing the red lenses. At mid-year, a new Royale Brougham LS was added to the 88 line almost simultaneous to the introduction of a new and downsized 1985 [[front-wheel drive]] [[Oldsmobile 98|Ninety-Eight]]. With the Ninety-Eight being downsized and converted to front-drive, the '''Royale Brougham LS''' model of the 88 was now the largest and most luxurious [[rear-wheel drive]] car offered by Oldsmobile. Custom Cruiser wagons continued with the same styling changes found on other 88 models.\n\n[[File:81-85 Oldsmobile Delta 88.jpg|thumb|left|1985 Oldsmobile Delta 88 Royale sedan]]\n\nOnly minor changes marked the 1985 model, which was in its last year before a major downsizing and conversion to [[front-wheel-drive]]. The same assortment of models in the Royale, Brougham and Brougham LS continued as before. The '85 88s would be the last full-sized Oldsmobile sedans and coupes to feature rear-wheel-drive, Rocket V8 power, and body-on-frame construction. Though the 88 [[Sedan (car)|sedans]] and [[coupe]]s were downsized and switched to front-drive for 1986, the Custom Cruiser [[station wagon]]s would continue virtually unchanged through the 1990 model year and eventually become the only Oldsmobile model powered by an Oldsmobile Rocket [[V8 engine|V8]] engine, for which production ended in 1990 after 42 years.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== Ninth generation (1986\u20131991) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name        = Ninth generation\n| image       = Oldsmobile Eighty-Eight -- 08-28-2009.jpg\n| caption     = 1990 Oldsmobile Eighty Eight Royale sedan\n| aka         = {{unbulleted list|Oldsmobile Delta 88 (1986\u201388)|Oldsmobile Eighty Eight Royale (1989\u201391)}}\n| model_years = 1986\u20131991\n| assembly    = {{unbulleted list|[[Flint, Michigan]]|[[Ypsilanti, Michigan]]|[[Wentzville, Missouri]]}}\n| body_style  = {{unbulleted list|2-door [[coupe]]|4-door [[Sedan (car)|sedan]]}}\n| layout      = [[Transverse engine|Transverse]] [[Front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout|front-engine, front-wheel drive]]\n| platform    = [[GM H platform (FWD)|H-body]]\n| related     = {{unbulleted list|[[Buick LeSabre]]|[[Pontiac Bonneville]]}}\n| engine      = 3.8 L ''[[Buick V6 engine#3.8 FWD LG2/LG3|Buick LG3]]'' [[V6 engine|V6]]<small>{{Collapsible list\n | title       = Specifications \n | frame_style = border:none;

The headlights changed from square sealed beam quads to integrated regular/high beam composite lamps in 1987. A few [[NASCAR]] teams built racecars with 1986 Delta 88 sheetmetal and ran them on the circuit in the 86-88 seasons, but only one victory (with [[Terry Labonte]]) was scored.\n\nDue to the federal mandate to add passive restraints, door mounted seat belts were added for 1987. For 1988, rear shoulder belts were added. For 1989, the \"Delta\" name was dropped, as was the hood ornament, leaving the model to simply become the \"Eighty Eight,\" now spelled out instead of using the \"88\" in numerical form, and deleted the amber color from the taillights. A driver airbag became an available option.\n\nThe Eighty Eight was given a mild facelift in 1990, eliminating the former chromed grille for a body-colored fascia with four slots and the Oldsmobile Rocket logo.  In the rear, new taillights and backup lights extended across the body; once again, chrome trim was deleted. Minor revisions were also made to the interior. Part of the door panel was revised and 1990 also offered new cloth for the seats. The Pillow Cushion seats on the Brougham were deleted. A revised armrest console was also added, this one provided more room. As an option was a revised electronic climate control system. A new choice of alloy wheels was an option.\n\n1991 was the last year for the coupe.  The model range during this time was the standard Eighty Eight, the Eighty Eight Royale, and the Eighty Eight Royale Brougham, in ascending order. <ref>http://www.lov2xlr8.no/brochures/olds/90olds/14.html</ref><ref>http://www.lov2xlr8.no/brochures/olds/86omo/bilder/10.jpg</ref><ref>http://www.lov2xlr8.no/brochures/olds/86omo/bilder/11.jpg</ref>\n\n'''Engines:'''\n* 1986\u20131988.5 \u2013 3.8 L (231&nbsp;in\u00b3) [[Buick V6 engine#3.8 FWD|LG3]] [[V6]]\n* 1988.5\u20131991 \u2013 3.8 L (231&nbsp;in\u00b3) [[Buick V6 engine#3800 V6|3800]] LN3 [[V6]]\n\n'''Transmissions:'''\n* 1986\u20131988.5 \u2013 440-T4 4-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic overdrive]]\n* 1988.5\u20131991 \u2013 4T60 4-speed automatic overdrive\n\n=== Voice diagnostic system ===\nThis generation of Delta 88s had an optional voice diagnostic system that alerted the driver of problems.<ref>1989 Oldsmobile full-line sales catalog: The New Generation of Oldsmobile</ref> The voice was male and computer synthesized.\n\nIn the event of a warning, the door chime played three times rapidly and then played the voice alert.

This was the last '''Eighty Eight''' or '''88''' model from Oldsmobile (along with its performance '''LSS''' and '''Regency''' models) before being discontinued in 1999 and being replaced in 2001 with the Aurora. The 3.8&nbsp;L Buick V6 was still the only engine, but output increased to {{convert|170|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|220|lb\u00b7ft|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque.\n\nThe Eighty-Eight's front and rear were restyled for 1996, and with it the nomenclature was changed from \"Eighty Eight Royale\" to three models \u2013 '''Eighty Eight''', '''Eighty Eight LS''' and '''LSS''' (A \"Luxury Sports Sedan\" targeted to male European car buyers, available with a supercharged [[V6]] and a floor mounted gear shifter).  It is important to note, however, early LSS models (1995) were rarely equipped with the 3800 Supercharged engine.  The LSS was an originally a trim level package on the 88 starting in 1992. In 1996 the LSS received Aurora-inspired seats. 1996 was the final year that the original-style rocket (in black and silver) appeared on a hood emblem. 1997 would welcome the new Oldsmobile logo on all Eighty-Eight trims except the Regency.<ref>http://www.lov2xlr8.no/brochures/olds/95_88/95_88.html</ref>\n\nAfter the demise of the [[Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight|Ninety-Eight]] in 1996, Oldsmobile added the '''Regency''' to the 1997 and 1998 lineups, which used the same front fenders and chrome grille as the Ninety-Eight sedan but kept the standard Eighty-Eight body. The Regency featured a long list of standard features including traction control, leather upholstery, dual 6-way power seats with power lumbar and a driver's side memory function, a dual-zone automatic climate control system, and an electronic level control for the rear suspension. A driver's side [[electrochromic]] outside mirror was also standard on the Regency, a feature that even [[Cadillac]] didn't offer as standard equipment. The interior day/night auto-dimming mirror was linked to the outside mirror and dimmed both with the same intensity at the same time. Some of these options, like the 2-driver memory feature, were not available on the Eighty-Eight Royale or LSS. \n\nTo commemorate the 50th anniversary of the 88/Eighty-Eight nameplate, Oldsmobile offered a special 50th Anniversary Edition of the 1999 Eighty-Eight. This edition included front and rear leather bench seats from the 98/Regency, steering wheel with audio and HVAC controls, the older rocket logo, electronic climate control unit, gold plated badges, and special Anniversary badges on the C-pillars and front door panels.\n\nAll four vehicles used the same {{convert|110.8|in|mm|abbr=on}} wheelbase and shared an updated version of the [[GM H platform (FWD)|H-body]]. The suspension tuning, interior appointments, and certain exterior trim was used to differentiate the three models.\n\n'''Engines:'''\n* 1992\u20131994 3.8&nbsp;L (231&nbsp;in\u00b3) [[Buick V6 engine#Series I|3800 Series I]] [[V6]], {{convert|170|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}\n* 1995\u20131999 3.8&nbsp;L (231&nbsp;in\u00b3) [[Buick V6 engine#Series II|3800 Series II]] V6, {{convert|205|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}\n* 1995 3.8&nbsp;L (231&nbsp;in\u00b3) [[Buick V6 engine#L67 Supercharged|supercharged 3800 Series I]] V6, {{convert|225|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} which was only installed on 100 vehicles of its kind.\n* 1996\u20131999 3.8&nbsp;L (231&nbsp;in\u00b3) [[Buick V6 engine#Series II|supercharged 3800 Series II]] V6, {{convert|240|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}\n\nFrom 1992 to 1999, Eighty Eight models were produced in [[Lake Orion, Michigan]], [[Flint, Michigan]], and [[Wentzville, Missouri]].<ref>https://www.copart.com/lot/32443257/Photos</ref>\n\n'''Year-to-year changes:'''\n* 1992: The redesign. Models included the Eighty-Eight Royale and the Eighty-Eight Royale LS. The 1992 full line Oldsmobile factory brochure makes brief mention of the LSS (Luxury Sport Sedan) model in one small photo, yet it doesn't appear later in the options summary. \n* 1993: Trunk mounted key cover emblem removed. The Eight Eight LSS returned with better factory promotion of its sporty option package that included: Bucket seats (a pair of right-hand halves of the standard 60/40 split bench seat), steering wheel audio and HVAC controls, floor shifter and center console (borrowed from the previous generation Pontiac Bonneville SSE) in the interior, and full instrumentation for the dash. Sixteen inch alloy wheels, higher spring rates and larger diameter stabilizer bars for the front and rear suspension gave the LSS a firm ride and more controlled handling. \n* 1994: The first facelift: Front grille and headlamps were redesigned, 'sculpted' aluminum turbine rims were made available.  A major redesign to the dash added a passenger side airbag and made it less cluttered and more modern. \n* 1995: The 3.8L [[V6 engine]] was bumped from {{convert|170|hp|abbr=on}} to {{convert|205|hp|abbr=on}}.  All models shared this same 3.8L engine. The optional L67 3800 Supercharged engine, making {{convert|225|hp|abbr=on}}, was made an available option for the LSS, and later other models. First OEM GPS system introduced by any manufacturer, as an option the Oldsmobile Guidestar.<ref>http://autosofinterest.com/2015/05/01/1995-oldsmobile-guidestar-navigation-system/</ref>\n* 1996: The second facelift: New front grille and new round headlights, all body trim was changed to give the car a cleaner, more aerodynamic appearance.  Tailamps and rear reflector bar were slightly reshaped.  All models were renamed from ''Eighty Eight Royale'' to ''Eighty Eight'' and ''Eighty Eight LS'' ([LS] which migrated from an 88 Royale trim).  The LSS continued with the same changes to the exterior as other models, the addition of Aurora styled seats, but the same center console was retained for one more year. The supercharged LSS engine was bumped from {{convert|225|hp|abbr=on}} to {{convert|240|hp|abbr=on}}.\n* 1997: An upscale, \"fully loaded\" version of the Eighty-Eight was introduced as the ''Oldsmobile Regency'' to satisfy previous [[Oldsmobile 98#1991\u20131996|Ninety-Eight]] buyers. All Oldsmobile Eighty Eight and LSS models (except for the Regency) changed badges from the '80s Oldsmobile \"Rocket\" logo to the 1997\u20132004 Oldsmobile \"Rocket Oval\" logo, inspired by the Aurora's logo. The center console on bucket seat cars was also redesigned to fit up against the lower part of the dash, allowed for rear passenger vents, and 2 cup holders for front the occupants.\n* 1998: Last year for the Regency which kept the old \"Rocket\" logo. The last Oldsmobile Regency rolled off the assembly line on June 18, 1998.\n* 1999: Last year for both Eighty Eight and LSS models. This was also the last Oldsmobile sedan to have 6-passenger seating as an option. The last Oldsmobile LSS was produced on September 23, 1998. The last Oldsmobile Eighty Eight 50th Anniversary Edition was manufactured on January 6, 1999.\n\n===Oldsmobile Guidestar===\n\nThe Guidestar system was designed off of the previous TravTek [[Automotive_navigation_system|GPS]] that Oldsmobile developed with [[Avis_Rent_a_Car|Avis]] and [[American_Automobile_Association|AAA]],that was tested in the 1990-1992 [[Oldsmobile_Toronado|Oldsmobile Toronado Trofeo]]. Once the Toronado was discontinued after 1992, the Oldsmobile division continued working on the system as the Guidestar using the newly acquired [[Hughes_Electronics|Hughes Electronics division]]  and [[Electronic_Data_Systems|EDS]]. The Oldsmobile Guidestar was a hard disk-based system  that offered satellite navigation for 17 states but lacked live traffic updates.

From 1950 to 1974 the 88 was the division's top-selling line, particularly the entry-level models such as the 88 and Dynamic 88. The 88 series was also an image leader for Oldsmobile, particularly in the early years (1949\u201351) when it was one of the best performing automobiles thanks to its relatively small size, light weight and advanced overhead-valve high-compression V8 engine. This engine, originally designed for the larger [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-bodied]] and more luxurious 98 series, also replaced the [[Oldsmobile Straight-8 engine|straight-8]] on the smaller [[GM B platform|B-bodied]] [[Oldsmobile Series 70|78]]. With the large, high performance V8, the Oldsmobile 88 is considered by some to be the first [[muscle car]], although this title is disputed.\n\nA large number of variations in nomenclature were seen over this long model run \u2014 Futuramic, Super, Golden Rocket, Dynamic, Jetstar, Delta, Delmont, Starfire, Holiday, L/S, LSS, Celebrity, and Royale were used at various times with the 88 badge, and Fiesta appeared on some station wagons in the 1950s and 1960s. The name was more commonly shown as numbers in the earlier years (\"Delta 88\", for example) and was changed to spell out \"Eighty Eight\" starting in 1989.\n\n== First generation (1949\u20131953) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name         = First generation\n| image        = File:1950 Oldsmobile Rockett 88 DE-93-36 p6.jpg\n| caption      = 1950 Oldsmobile 88\n| aka          = {{unbulleted list|Oldsmobile DeLuxe 88|Oldsmobile Super 88}}\n| model_years  = 1949\u20131953\n| assembly     = {{unbulleted list|[[South Gate, California]]|[[Wilmington, Delaware]]|[[Doraville, Georgia]]|[[Kansas City, Kansas]]|[[Framingham, Massachusetts]]|[[Lansing, Michigan]]|[[Linden, New Jersey]]}}\n| body_style   = {{unbulleted list|2-door ''Holiday'' [[hardtop]]|2-door [[coupe]]|4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]|4-door [[station wagon]]}}\n| layout       = [[Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout|FR layout]]\n| platform     = [[GM B platform|B-body]]\n| related      = {{unbulleted list|[[Buick Special]]|[[Pontiac Streamliner]]}}\n| engine       = {{convert|303|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Oldsmobile V8 engine#303|Rocket]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]]\n| transmission = {{unbulleted list|3-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]]|4-speed ''[[Hydramatic|Hydra-Matic]]'' [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]}}\n| wheelbase    = {{unbulleted list|1949\u201350: {{convert|119.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}|1951 88: {{convert|119.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}|1951 Super 88: {{convert|120|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}|1952\u201353: {{convert|120|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}}}\n| length       = {{convert|202|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Oldsmobile/1951%20Oldsmobile/1951_Oldsmobile_Foldout/1951%20Oldsmobile%20Foldout-18.html|title=Directory Index: Oldsmobile/1951 Oldsmobile/1951_Oldsmobile_Foldout|publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com|date= |accessdate=2012-01-08}}</ref>\n| width       = {{convert|75.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"flory2008\">{{cite book|last=Flory, Jr.|first=J. \"Kelly\"|title=American Cars, 1946-1959 Every Model Every Year|year=2008|publisher=McFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers|isbn=978-0-7864-3229-5}}</ref>\n}}\n\n[[File:BuckBaker1949OldsmobileRocket.jpg|thumb|left|[[Buck Baker]]'s 1949 Oldsmobile Rocket 88 [[Stock car racing|stock car]]]]\n[[File:1949 Oldsmobile 88.jpg|thumb|left|1949 Oldsmobile 88]]\n[[File:1950 Oldsmobile Rockett 88 DE-93-36 p1.jpg|thumb|left|1950 Oldsmobile Rocket 88 Club Sedan]]\n[[File:Oldsmobile 88 Coupe (Centropolis Laval '10).jpg|thumb|left|1952 Oldsmobile 88 Holiday hardtop coupe]]\n[[File:Oldsmobile 88 dutch licence registration AL-44-98 pic5.JPG|thumb|left|1953 Oldsmobile Super 88 Convertible Coup\u00e9]]\n\n[[Oldsmobile]] introduced the 88 badge in 1949. It was named to complement the already-existing [[Oldsmobile Series 70|76]] and [[Oldsmobile 98|98]], and took the place of the [[Oldsmobile Straight-8 engine|straight-8 engined]] 78 in the model lineup. The new car used the same new Futuramic [[GM B platform|B-body]] platform as the [[Oldsmobile Straight-6 engine|straight-6 engined]] 76 but paired it with the new {{convert|303|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Oldsmobile V8 engine|Rocket V8 engine]] producing {{Convert|135|hp|kW|0}}. This combination of a relatively small light body and large, powerful engine made it widely considered to be the first [[muscle car]]. The Rocket 88 vaulted Oldsmobile from a somewhat staid, conservative car to a performer that became the one to beat on the [[NASCAR]] (National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing) circuits. It won six of the nine NASCAR late-model division races in 1949, 10 of 19 in 1950, 20 of 41 in 1952, and was eventually eclipsed by the low-slung, powerful [[Hudson Hornet]], but it was still the first real \"King of NASCAR.\"<ref>[http://www.canadiandriver.com/articles/bv/rocket88.htm Vance, Bill. \"1949 Oldsmobile \"Rocket\" 88\" Canadian Driver, October 19, 2004], retrieved on 2008-06-08.</ref> This led to increased sales to the public. There was a pent up demand for new cars in the fast-expanding post-[[World War II]] economy, and the 88 appealed to many ex-military personnel who were young and had operated powerful military equipment.\n\nThe 88 enjoyed great success, inspiring a popular 1950s slogan, \"Make a Date with a Rocket 88\", and also a song, \"[[Rocket 88]]\", often considered the [[first rock and roll record]]. Starting with the trunk-lid emblem of the 1950 model, Oldsmobile would adopt the rocket as its logo, and the 88 name would remain in the Olds lineup until the late 1990s, almost until the end of Oldsmobile itself.\n\nThe 1949 model was equipped with an ignition key and a starter push-button to engage the starter. Pushing the starter button would engage the starter, but if the ignition key was not inserted, unlocking the ignition, the car would not start. The car was equipped with an [[Air filter#Oil Bath|oil bath air cleaner]]. At the bottom edge of the front fender directly behind the front wheel was a badge that said \"Futuramic\" which identified an Oldsmobile approach to simplified driving, and the presence of an automatic transmission. V8 Oldsmobiles were automatic-only in 1949 as Oldsmobile lacked a manual gearbox that could handle the torque of the new engine.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m9_7lqg6Hc 1948 Oldsmobile Futuramic introduction] In 1950, Oldsmobile offered a modified Cadillac manual gearbox for V8 models. The 88 now outsold the six-cylinder 76 lineup, which was dropped entirely after the 1950 model year. It had a 40&nbsp;ft. turning circle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Oldsmobile/1950%20Oldsmobile/1950_Oldsmobile_Foldout/1950%20Oldsmobile%20Foldout-18.html |title=Directory Index: Oldsmobile/1950 Oldsmobile/1950_Oldsmobile_Foldout |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-08}}</ref> [[Hershel McGriff]] and Ray Elliot  won with the 1950 model won the [[1950 Carrera Panamericana]].\n\nFor 1951, the 88 was now the entry-level Olds with the discontinuation of the [[Straight-6|six-cylinder]] 76 line, which meant that all Oldsmobiles were powered by Rocket V8s. An in-house manual transmission replaced the modified Cadillac gearbox, but as the 1950s progressed, manual shift became increasingly rare in Oldsmobiles and normally could only be obtained by special order. New this year was the more upscale '''Super 88''' line on the new GM B-body<ref name=\"flory2008\"/> which included restyled rear body panels, a more luxurious interior, and a slightly longer {{convert|120|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase as opposed to the {{convert|119.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase which had been standard since the 88's introduction. The station wagon was discontinued and would not reappear until the 1957 model year. New was an I-beam frame. Hydraulic power windows and seats were optional.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Oldsmobile/1951%20Oldsmobile/1951_Oldsmobile_Foldout/1951%20Oldsmobile%20Foldout-18.html |title=Directory Index: Oldsmobile/1951 Oldsmobile/1951_Oldsmobile_Foldout |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-25}}</ref>\n\nIn 1952, the base 88 shared the Super 88's rear body panels and wheelbase, and came with a Rocket V8 and two-barrel [[carburetor]] while Super 88s came with a new four-barrel carburetor upping the output to {{Convert|160|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. Other mechanical features were unchanged with styling changes amounting to new grilles, taillights, and interior revisions. New was the optional automatic headlight control.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Oldsmobile/1952%20Oldsmobile/1952_Oldsmobile_Autronic_Eye_Foldout/1952%20Oldsmobile%20Autronic%20Eye%20Foldout-rear.html |title=Directory Index: Oldsmobile/1952 Oldsmobile/1952_Oldsmobile_Autronic_Eye_Foldout |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-25}}</ref>\n\nFor 1953, the base 88 was renamed the DeLuxe 88<ref name=\"flory2008\"/> for only this one year while the Super 88 continued as a more upscale version. Engines and transmission offerings were the same as 1952. Late in the 1953 model year, a fire destroyed GM's Hydra-Matic plant in [[Livonia, Michigan]], which was then the only source for Hydra-Matic transmissions. The temporary loss of Hydra-Matic production led Oldsmobile to build thousands of its 1953 models with Buick's two-speed Dynaflow automatic transmissions until GM pressed its [[Willow Run Transmission]] plant into service to resume Hydra-Matic production. New options this year included Frigidaire air conditioning, power steering, and power brakes.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Second generation (1954\u20131956) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name         = Second generation\n| image        = 1956 Oldsmobile 88.jpg\n| caption      = 1956 Oldsmobile Super 88 convertible\n| aka          = Oldsmobile Super 88\n| model_years  = 1954\u20131956\n| assembly     = {{unbulleted list|[[South Gate, California]]|[[Wilmington, Delaware]]|[[Doraville, Georgia]]|[[Kansas City, Kansas]]|[[Framingham, Massachusetts]]|[[Lansing, Michigan]]|[[Linden, New Jersey]]}}\n| body_style   = {{unbulleted list|2-door ''Holiday'' [[hardtop]]|2-door [[coupe]]|4-door ''Holiday'' hardtop|4-door [[Sedan (car)|sedan]]}}\n| layout       = [[Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout|FR layout]]\n| platform     = [[GM B platform|B-body]]\n| engine       = {{convert|324|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Oldsmobile V8 engine#324|Rocket]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]]\n| transmission = {{unbulleted list|3-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]]|4-speed ''[[Hydramatic|Hydra-Matic]]'' [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]}}\n| wheelbase    = {{convert|122.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"oldcarbrochures1954\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Oldsmobile/1954%20Oldsmobile/1954_Oldsmobile_Brochure_2/1954%20Oldsmobile-a30.html|title=Directory Index: Oldsmobile/1954 Oldsmobile/1954_Oldsmobile_Brochure_2|publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com|date= |accessdate=2012-01-08}}</ref>\n|length        = {{convert|205.26|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"oldcarbrochures1954\"/>\n}}\n\n[[File:Oldsmobile 88 1954 5310cc.jpg|thumb|left|1954 Oldsmobile 88 sedan]]\n[[File:Oldsmobile 88 Holiday sedan (1955) at Schaffen-Diest Fly-drive 2013.JPG|thumb|left|1955 Oldsmobile Super 88 Holiday hardtop coupe]]\n[[File:Oldsmobile 88 1955 - Falk\u00f6ping cruising 2014 - 6699.jpg|thumb|left|1955 Oldsmobile 88 sedan]]\n[[File:1956 Oldsmobile Super 88 Deluxe Sedan (CASM).jpg|thumb|left|1956 Oldsmobile Super 88 4-Door Sedan]]\n\nThe 1954 Oldsmobiles were completely restyled with new longer and lower body shells and wrap-around windshields and rear windows. Wheelbases increased to {{convert|122|in|m}}. Base models reverted to being simply called 88s after being designated as DeLuxe 88s for only one year and the Super 88 was once again the top series (beneath the larger [[Oldsmobile 98|98]]). The Rocket V8 was enlarged from 303 to 324 cubic inches with 88s powered by a two-barrel, {{convert|170|hp}} unit while Super 88s came with a {{convert|185|hp}} version with four-barrel carburetor. Also, a safety padded dash became optional, at $17.<ref name=\"flory2008\"/>\n\nThe 1955 models were heavily [[Facelift (automobile)|facelifted]] with new grillework, taillights and body-side chrome. Horsepower for the 324-cubic-inch Rocket V8 increased to 185 for 88s and 202 for Super 88s. At mid-year, Olds introduced the new pillarless four-door hardtop body, dubbed the Holiday sedan, in both the 88 and Super 88 series. The four-door Oldsmobile 88 Holiday, along with the four-door [[Oldsmobile 98|98 Holiday]], [[Buick Century|Buick Century Riviera]], and [[Buick Special|Special Riviera]], were the first four-door [[hardtop]]s ever produced.

A new four-speed Jetaway Hydra-Matic was introduced this year to replace the original Hydra-Matic transmission that Olds had used since 1940. The new Jetaway Hydra-Matic retained the four forward speeds and fluid coupling unit, but added a new \"Park\" position to the shift quadrant and no longer required band adjustment as a specified routine maintenance.

Although rare, three speed manual transmissions were still available.  Styling highlights were more evolutional than radical overall with three-piece rear window styling utilized on some models. Oldsmobile revived station wagons for the first time since 1950 with the Super 88 Fiesta being a four-door hardtop design.

The styling was advertised by Olds as the \"Mobile Look.\" The '''Dynamic 88''' debuted in 1958 and lasted through 1966 positioned as the entry level model below the '''Super 88.'''

Oldsmobile was also way ahead of other middle-priced competitors such as sister division Pontiac, Mercury, Dodge and Chrysler, along with Ford Motor Company's all-new and ill-fated [[Edsel]], and Chrysler Corporation's [[DeSoto (automobile)|DeSoto]] - the latter two nameplates of which would fade into oblivion within the next three years.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Fourth generation (1959\u20131960) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name         = Fourth generation\n| image        = Oldsmobile Super 88 - Flickr - Alexandre Pr\u00e9vot.jpg\n| caption      = 1959 Oldsmobile Super 88 4-door Sedan\n| aka          = {{unbulleted list|Oldsmobile Rocket 88|Oldsmobile Dynamic 88|Oldsmobile Super 88}}\n| model_years  = 1959\u20131960\n| assembly     = {{unbulleted list|[[Doraville, Georgia]]|[[Baltimore, Maryland]]|[[South Gate, California]]|[[Kansas City, Kansas]]|[[Kansas City, Missouri]]|[[Fremont, California]]|[[Linden, New Jersey]]|[[Lansing, Michigan]]|[[Arlington, Texas]]}}\n| body_style   = {{unbulleted list|2-door ''Holiday'' [[hardtop]]|2-door [[coupe]]|2-door [[convertible (car)|convertible]]|4-door ''Holiday'' hardtop|4-door [[Sedan (car)|sedan]]|4-door [[station wagon]]}}\n| layout       = [[Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout|FR layout]]\n| platform     = [[GM B platform|B-body]]\n| related      = {{unbulleted list|[[Buick Lesabre]]|[[Pontiac Catalina]]}}\n| engine       = {{unbulleted list|{{convert|371|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Oldsmobile V8 engine#371|Rocket]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]]|{{convert|374|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Oldsmobile V8 engine#374|Rocket]]'' V8|{{convert|394|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Oldsmobile V8 engine#394|Rocket]]'' V8}}\n| transmission = {{unbulleted list|3-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]]|4-speed ''[[Hydramatic|Hydra-Matic]]'' [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]}}\n| wheelbase    = {{convert|123.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| length       = {{convert|217.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref>http://oldcarbrochures.org/index.php/New-Brochures---November/1960-Oldsmobile-Brochure-Cdn/1960-Oldsmobile-Cdn--30-31</ref>\n| width        = {{convert|80.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n}}\n\n[[File:Oldsmobile Super 88 1959 L\u00e4nsrundan.jpg|thumb|left|1959 Oldsmobile Super 88 Holiday Scenicoupe]]\n[[File:1959 Oldsmobile Super 88 (35381807842).jpg|thumb|left|1959 Oldsmobile Super 88 Holiday Sport Sedan]]\n[[File:1960 Oldsmobile 88 convertible.jpg|thumb|left|1960 Oldsmobile Dynamic 88 Convertible]]\n[[File:1960 Oldsmobile 88 (15257636257).jpg|thumb|left|1960 Oldsmobile Dynamic 88 Holiday Scenicoupe, rear view]]\n\nAll Oldsmobiles were completely restyled for 1959, with the 88 series given longer, lower and wider styling on a GM B-body chassis. The 88 shared its appearance with the top-model [[Oldsmobile 98]]. Styling highlights for the new models, promoted as the \"Linear Look,\" included six-window styling on four-door pillared sedans, glassy semi-fastback rooflines on Holiday coupes and flat-blade rooflines with thin windshield and C-pillars on Holiday sedans which created a large open greenhouse effect. Two-door hardtops were called \"Holiday Scenicoupes,\" whereas four-door hardtops were called \"Holiday Sport Sedans.\"  While many 1959 model cars featured bigger and sharper fins, Olds flattened theirs horizontally and reduced chrome from 1958 for a much cleaner look. Wheelbases on 88 models increased by one inch to {{convert|123|in|mm|0}}.\n\nA larger, 394 cubic-inch Rocket V8 with four-barrel carburation rated at {{Convert|315|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} was standard on the '''Super 88'''. The lower-priced '''Dynamic 88''' retained the two-barrel {{Convert|265|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 371 cubic-inch '57\u201358 Rocket V8, with a {{Convert|300|hp|kW|-1|abbr=on}} four-barrel version optional.\n\nA simpler but bold new grille and revised rear design with even flatter, horizontal tailfins and new taillights highlighted the 1960 makeover. Power for Super 88 models remained the same, while Dynamic 88s had their 371 ci Rocket V8 detuned to {{Convert|240|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, where a lower compression ratio accommodated lower-priced regular gasoline. Other changes included a revised instrument panel and a slimmer transmission tunnel for improved interior space.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Fifth generation (1961\u20131964) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name         = Fifth generation\n| image        = 1961 Oldsmobile Dynamic 88 Convertible (35232134240).jpg\n| caption      = 1961 Oldsmobile Dynamic 88 Convertible\n| model_years  = 1961\u20131964\n| assembly     = {{unbulleted list|[[Doraville, Georgia]]|[[Baltimore, Maryland]]|[[South Gate, California]]|[[Kansas City, Kansas]]|[[Kansas City, Missouri]]|[[Fremont, California]]|[[Linden, New Jersey]]|[[Lansing, Michigan]]|[[Arlington, Texas]]}}\n| layout       = [[Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout|FR layout]]\n| aka          = {{unbulleted list|Oldsmobile Dynamic 88|Oldsmobile Jetstar 88|Oldsmobile Super 88}}\n| body_style   = {{unbulleted list|2-door [[hardtop]]|2-door [[coupe]]|4-door hardtop|4-door [[Sedan (car)|sedan]]|4-door [[station wagon]]}}\n| platform     = [[GM B platform|B-body]]\n| related      = {{unbulleted list|[[Buick Invicta]]|[[Buick LeSabre]]|[[Buick Wildcat]]  |[[Pontiac Bonneville]]|[[Pontiac Catalina|Pontiac Catalina/Laurentian]]|[[Pontiac Parisienne]]|[[Chevrolet Bel Air]]|[[Chevrolet Impala]]}}\n| engine       = {{unbulleted list|{{convert|330|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Oldsmobile V8 engine#Jetfire Rocket|Jetfire Rocket]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]]|{{convert|394|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Oldsmobile V8 engine#Sky Rocket|Sky Rocket]]'' V8}}\n| transmission = {{unbulleted list|3-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]]|3-speed ''[[GM Roto Hydramatic|Roto Hydra-Matic]]'' [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]}}\n| wheelbase    = {{convert|123.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| length       = {{convert|214.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n}}\n\nAn all-new body and chassis with perimeter \"Guard Beam\" frame and all-coil suspension replacing the previous leaf springs highlighted the 1961 full-sized Oldsmobiles, which were joined by the new compact [[Oldsmobile F-85|F-85]]. All full-sized Oldsmobiles were now powered by the 394-cubic-inch Rocket V8 with the Dynamic 88 getting a two-barrel, {{convert|250|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} version that used regular gas, while the Super 88 was powered by a four-barrel \"Ultra High Compression\" 394 Skyrocket V8 rated at {{convert|325|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The Skyrocket engine was available as an extra-cost option on the Dynamic 88. A new three-speed \"Roto\" Hydra-matic transmission that was smaller and lighter than the previous four-speed unit was introduced as an option.\n\n[[File:1961 Oldsmobile Dynamic 88 (35257871770).jpg|thumb|left|1961 Oldsmobile Dynamic 88 Celebrity Sedan, rear view]]\nThe 1961 Oldsmobile body design represented the after-effect of the 1958 recession.  While wheelbases remained the same as in 1960, the overall length and width were reduced slightly \u2013 a trend seen throughout all of GM's marques.  Body design focused on a trimmer, fuselage design.  At the bottom of the rear quarters, a \"[[skeg]]\"\u2014a downward fin\u2014jutted outboard to counterbalance the rearward point of the quarter panel. Round tail lights, one on each side, were set into the rear cove. For 1961, GM retired the compound curve windshields that it introduced in 1954, and the much hated body dogleg necessitated by the shape of the windshield.  Instead of adopting the cleaner straight angled \"A\" pillar, Harley Earl, who was nearing the end of his tenure at GM, pushed for a small curved switch back, used in 1961\u201362, at the outboard base of the windshield.\n\nLike for the previous model year, there were six body styles: a 2-door sedan, the Celebrity Sedan 4-door sedan, the Holiday Sedan 4-door hardtop, the Holiday Coupe 2-door hardtop, the Convertible Coupe drop-top and the Fiesta station wagon, available in both 2- and 3-seat models. All body styles but the 2-door sedan (which was the price leader) were offered both as Dynamic 88 and Super 88. In general all models had thicker pillars than the extremely thin ones found on previous generation models. The Holiday Coupe 2-door hardtop continued the \"bubble top\" look. The 1961 Holiday Sedan 4-door hardtop had thicker, parallelogram-shaped rear pillar than its predecessor. The extreme \"floating roof\" look of the 1959\u20131960 4-door hardtop, with wrap-around panoramic rear window and overhanging roof, had been passed on to the pillared Celebrity Sedan\u2014which had switched from the previous year six-window to a four-window greenhouse. Six-window sedans continued to be offered in the [[Oldsmobile 98|98]] line.\n\nAt mid-year, a sporty and luxurious convertible called the [[Oldsmobile Starfire]] was introduced. It was based on the Super 88 ragtop and featured leather bucket seats, center console with floor shifter for the Hydra-matic transmission (incidentally the first U.S. full-sized production car to feature an automatic transmission with a console-mounted floor shifter) and many other standard items such as power steering, brakes, windows and driver's seat. The Starfire was also powered by an even higher-performance version of the \"Ultra High Compression\" 394-cubic-inch Starfire V8 rated at {{Convert|335|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.\n\n[[File:1962 Oldsmobile Super 88 (19020225312).jpg|thumb|left|1962 Oldsmobile Super 88 Holiday Coupe]]\n[[File:1962 Oldsmobile Super 88 Celebrity 4 door Sedan.jpg|thumb|left|1962 Oldsmobile Super 88 Celebrity Sedan]]\n[[File:Oldsmobile station wagon white.jpg|thumb|left|For 1962 the Oldsmobile Dynamic 88 Fiesta station wagon mostly retained the rear design of the 1961 model]]\nFor 1962, the Oldsmobile 88 received a \"second-year\" facelift that included a revised grille and front bumper. Length was increased somewhat to give the '62 Olds a longer look. Changes to the rear included the removal of the rear fender skegs (personally ordered by GM's Vice President of design [[Bill Mitchell (designer)|Bill Mitchell]], who disliked them), and oval taillights, one on each side for Dynamic and Super 88 models replaced the 1961's round units. 1962 Starfires received two oval lights per side, much like the concurrent Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight models. Changes to the greenhouse included new roof lines for the four-door Celebrity Sedan\u2014which relinquished the panoramic rear window\u2014and for the Holiday Coupe two-door hardtop, which received a new fashionable convertible-inspired roofline abandoning the \"bubble-top\" appearance. The two-door sedan, made redundant as entry-level model by the previous year's introduction of the [[Oldsmobile F-85|F-85]] compact, was discontinued. Lastly, the Fiesta station wagon was only partially restyled, retaining most of the 1961's rear styling; the 3-seat wagon was now only available as Dynamic 88.\n\nEngines were uprated to {{convert|280|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} for the standard engine in the Dynamic 88 thanks to a higher compression ratio that demanded the use of premium fuel (a regular-fuel {{convert|260|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} version was offered as a no-cost option), 330 horses for the \"Skyrocket\" V8 standard on Super 88 and Ninety-Eight and 345 horsepower for the top Starfire Rocket V8. Oldsmobile marketing continued to use the trade names of \"Roto-matic Power Steering\" and \"Pedal-eeze Power Brakes\".\nAll Oldsmobiles featured the \"speed bar\" speedometer. Introduced in 1959, the speedometer used a rolling black cylinder with sections painted brilliant green, yellow and bright red. As the car went from a standing stop forward in speed, the cylinder rolled, first exposing the green in a window that matched the numeric speed on stationary speed dial for low speeds, yellow at moderate speeds, and finally red at highway speeds. Drivers who topped the car over 100&nbsp;mph moved the cylinder into an area where only the black base color was visible. For 1963, Oldsmobile would revert to a standard speed needle sweeping over a calibrated set of speeds instead.\n\n1962 Oldsmobile Dynamic 88s and Dynamic 88 Fiesta wagons each had their own upholstery patterns in single and dual-tone colors. Super 88s received tri-tone upholstery and trim. Heaters became standard equipment on all models, and the push-button controls were located to the right of the steering wheel column. Vehicles not equipped with air conditioning received push-button vacuum-operated fresh air vents, called \"Summer Ventilation\", which replaced the pull level type vents.  This control panel was located on the left of the steering column.  Cars equipped with factory air conditioning replaced the vent control panel with the air conditioning panel, which also contained its own blower switch.  These cars also sported round dash vents for the delivery of A/C airflow. Dynamic 88s received aqua dashboard panel inserts with \"OLDSMOBILE\" lettering, while Super 88s received panels with that model's nomenclature on the insert.\n\nAll full-sized Oldsmobiles underwent extensive body and trim revisions for 1963. Most of the underlying basic body structure and rooflines were carried over from '62 with new exterior sheet metal abandoning the previous years' sculpted mid-sections; Lincoln Continental-style slab sides and sharper edges being employed overall. The Starfire gained an exclusive razor-edged roof treatment utilizing a concave backlight similar to that of the new Pontiac Grand Prix. Different rear quarter panels meant Oldsmobile 88s and the more expensive 98s were more differentiated than before. 1963 also brought about GM's across-the-board adoption of the straight angled windshield \"A\" pillar on all full-size production vehicles eliminating the unusual 1961 through 1962 reverse-curve treatment. Models and drivetrains in both the Dynamic 88 and Super 88 series were unchanged from 1962. Options that year included a \"tilt-away\" steering wheel that could be adjusted to six positions, six-way power seats, AM/FM radio and cruise control.<ref>http://oldcarbrochures.org/index.php/New-Brochures---April/1963-Oldsmobile-Full-Size-Owners-Manual/1963-Full-Size-Oldsmobile-Manual-32-33</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n| direction = vertical\n| image1    = 1964 Oldsmobile Jetstar 88, front left.jpg\n| image2    = 1964 Oldsmobile Jetstar 88, rear left.jpg\n| footer    = 1964 Oldsmobile Jetstar 88 Celebrity Sedan}}\nThe sharp-edged theme continued for 1964, Oldsmobile's full-sized cars received a minor face-lift that included revised trim, grilles and taillights. New that year was the introduction of price leader for the full-sized Oldsmobile series, the '''Jetstar 88''', which used the same full-size body as other 88 models but also shared key components with that year's redesigned [[Oldsmobile F-85|F-85]] [[Mid-size car|intermediate]]. The Jetstar 88 used the smaller [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#Jetfire Rocket|330 V8]] and Jetaway ([[Super Turbine 300]]) two-speed automatic transmission in place of the 394-cubic-inch V8 and [[Roto Hydramatic]] found in other Oldsmobiles, and 9.5-inch (241.3&nbsp;mm) [[drum brake]]s which were less effective than the {{convert|11|in|mm|0|sing=on}} drums found on other full-sized Olds models.\n\nOldsmobile also introduced the [[Oldsmobile Jetstar I|Jetstar I]] for 1964. Not part of the Jetstar 88 line, the Jetstar I instead was a direct competitor to the [[Pontiac Grand Prix]] in the same $3,500 price range. Jetstar I's shared the [[notchback]] body style with the [[Oldsmobile Starfire|Starfire]] along with its more powerful {{convert|345|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 394-cubic-inch Rocket V8 engine, but with less standard equipment and a lower price tag. Oddly, Oldsmobile teamed the {{convert|345|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} Rocket engine with a very unsuitable transmission in the Jetstar I, the Jetaway ([[Super Turbine 300]]) two-speed unit with \"switch pitch\" converter.\n\nWith the introduction of the Jetstar 88, the Dynamic 88 models were elevated a rung up the ladder for the 1964 model year. Only the Dynamic 88s could be in five body styles: four-door pillared Celebrity Sedan and hardtop Holiday Sedan, two-door hardtop Holiday Coupe, convertible and 2- or 3-seat Fiesta station wagon. The Jetstar 88 didn't offer a station wagon.\n\n1964 was the last for the Super 88 series, which was limited to the two four-door body styles\u2014the Celebrity Sedan and Holiday Sedan. Total production for both four-door Super 88 models reached 19,514 assemblies for the model year.\n\n[[File:1964 Oldsmobile Dynamic 88 Fiesta station wagon, rear left side.jpg|thumb|1964 Oldsmobile Dynamic 88 Fiesta station wagon]]\n1964 was also the last year for Oldsmobile to offer full-sized station wagons until the 1971 model year. Oldsmobile's full-size Fiesta wagons (and Buick's Estate Wagons) introduced in 1957 had never been strong sellers. From 1960 to 1963, production per model (Super or Dynamic) and seating capacity (six or nine passenger) never broke 15,000 units. The wagons' bodies weren't made by Fisher Body, but were instead farmed out to Ionia Manufacturing Company of Ionia, Michigan. As Oldsmobile set its sights on more luxury and performance, full-sized wagons weren't in the mix. The division introduced a new Vista Cruiser wagon in mid-1964 that featured a raised roofline and skylights over the rear seat and cargo area. The models were offered with six- or nine-passenger seating with all seats facing forward. The Vista Cruiser used a six-inch (152&nbsp;mm) stretched wheelbase version of the intermediate F-85/Cutlass. This allowed Oldsmobile (and Buick, which used the same body and stretch wheelbase for its Sport Wagon) to offer a wagon comparable in overall size to the full-sized Chevrolet Impala and Pontiac Catalina wagons, but without diluting the cachet of its full-size cars with a utilitarian body style.\n\n== Sixth generation (1965\u20131970) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name         = Sixth generation\n| image        = 1965 Oldsmobile Dynamic 88 (19651481130).jpg\n| caption      = 1965 Oldsmobile Dynamic 88 Holiday Coupe\n| aka          = {{unbulleted list|Oldsmobile Jetstar 88|Oldsmobile Dynamic 88|Oldsmobile Delta 88|Oldsmobile Delmont 88}}\n| model_years  = 1965\u20131970\n| assembly     = {{unbulleted list|[[Fremont, California]]|[[Doraville, Georgia]]|[[Fairfax, Kansas]]|[[Framingham, Massachusetts]]|[[Lansing, Michigan]]|[[Linden, New Jersey]]|[[Arlington, Texas]]}}\n| layout       = [[Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout|FR layout]]\n| platform     = [[GM B platform|B-body]]\n| related      = {{unbulleted list|[[Buick LeSabre]]|[[Buick Wildcat]] |[[Pontiac Bonneville]]|[[Pontiac Catalina|Pontiac Catalina/Laurentian]]|[[Pontiac Parisienne]]|[[Chevrolet Bel Air]]|[[Chevrolet Caprice]]|[[Chevrolet Impala]]}}\n| body_style   = {{unbulleted list|2-door [[hardtop]]|2-door [[convertible (car)|convertible]]|4-door hardtop|4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]}}\n| engine       = {{unbulleted list|{{convert|330|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Oldsmobile V8 engine#Jetfire Rocket|Jetfire Rocket]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]]|{{convert|350|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Oldsmobile V8 engine#350|Rocket 350]]'' V8|{{convert|425|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Oldsmobile V8 engine#Super Rocket|Super Rocket]]'' V8|{{convert|455|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Oldsmobile V8 engine#455|Rocket 455]]'' V8}}\n| transmission = {{unbulleted list|3-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]|3-speed automatic|4-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]]|3-speed manual transmission}}\n| wheelbase    = {{unbulleted list|1965\u201368: {{convert|123.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}|1969\u201370: {{convert|124.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}}}\n}}\n\nThe '''Delta''' name in 1965 was an upscale trim line of the Dynamic 88, the '''Dynamic 88 Delta''', replacing the previous top-series B-body Olds, the '''Super 88'''. Early '65s were referred to as Dynamic 88 Deltas, but within a few weeks after the start of the model year, Olds began marketing the line as a separate series known as the '''Delta 88.''' Other full-sized Oldsmobile model lines included the low-priced Jetstar 88, the volume-selling Dynamic 88, sporty [[Oldsmobile Jetstar I|Jetstar I]] and the sporty and luxurious [[Oldsmobile Starfire|Starfire]], all riding on a {{convert|123|in|mm|0|sing=on}} wheelbase.\n\nAll 1965 Olds models featured all new styling and engineering. The B-body cars featured more rounded styling than previous years with [[Coke bottle styling|Coke-bottle]] profiles and semi-fastback rooflines on Holiday (two-door hardtop) coupes - Jetstar I and Starfire coupes got a more rounded variation of the squared-off 1963\u201364 roofline with concave rear window shared by Pontiac's Grand Prix.\nAlso introduced this year was a new 425 cubic-inch Super Rocket V8 with horsepower ratings ranging from 300 to 370 depending on carburation and compression ratio. The new three-speed [[Turbo Hydramatic]] transmission with torque converter replaced the [[GM Roto Hydramatic transmission|Roto Hydramatic]] used since 1961. Also new to the option list for 1965 on all B-body cars was a four-speed [[manual transmission]] with Hurst floor shifter, which was a seldom-ordered offering.\n\n[[File:1966 Oldsmobile Delta 88 Holiday hardtop 4-door sedan.jpg|thumb|left|1966 Oldsmobile Delta 88 Holiday Sedan]]\nFew styling changes other than revised grilles and tail sections marked the 1966 full-sized Oldsmobiles. The sporty Jetstar I series was dropped with a lower-priced Starfire only offered as a hardtop coupe taking its place. All other series' 88 models were carried over from 1965 with a new convertible added to the Delta 88 line and the same bodystyle dropped from the Jetstar 88 line.\n\nA new option for all senior Oldsmobiles (88, Ninety-Eight and the new front-drive [[Oldsmobile Toronado|Toronado]]) was GM's automatic Comfortron Air Conditioning system first introduced by Cadillac in 1964. Comfortron permitted the driver to automatically set a year-round temperature at a constant level. The basic Frigidaire air conditioning unit offered in previous years continued as before and becoming an increasingly popular option on full-sized Oldsmobiles. Another new option for 1966 was a Tilt-and-Telescopic steering wheel that could be vertically adjusted to six different positions as well as telescoped outward from the instrument panel to improve driver comfort.\n\n[[File:1967 Oldsmobile Delta 88 HT sedan, Castle Hedingham 2008.jpg|thumb|left|1967 Oldsmobile Delta 88 Holiday Sedan]]\n[[File:1967 Oldsmobile Delta 88 coupe rear.jpg|thumb|left|1967 Oldsmobile Delta 88 Custom Holiday Coupe, rear view]]\nFor 1967, all GM full-size cars received a mid cycle freshening that featured fuller body panels. More rounded styling cues marked all 1967 Olds 88 models which received longer hoods and shorter decks and more sweeping fastback rooflines on 88 Holiday coupes to emulate the styling of Olds' front-wheel-drive flagship, the Toronado.  Olds 88's received a three part front grille made op of a center prow flanked on either side by headlight pods.  For the first time since 1959, the dual headlights were split apart by parking lights.  Taillights for 88's featured a waterfall design. Interiors made extensive use of wood-tone panels, and bright metal finishes were kept to a minimum.\n\nModel wise, there was more name juggling. The '''Delmont 88''' was introduced for 1967 and produced for just two years, replacing both the Jetstar 88 and Dynamic 88 model lines. The Delmont featured the [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#Jetfire Rocket|330 V8]] as standard and the [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#425|425 V8]] as an option in 1967 and the new stroked \"Rocket 455\" version of the same engine in 1968. The 425 was standard on the Delta 88. The Delta 88 gained a new sub series called the '''Delta 88 Custom''' which had a plusher interior than the standard Delta 88 featuring a Strato bench seat in the Holiday Sedan (four-door hardtop) or, in the Holiday Soupe (two-door hardtop), a choice of either Strato bucket seats with console or Strato bench seat with armrest. The Delta Custom Holiday Coupe was essentially a successor to the former 88-based [[Oldsmobile Starfire|Starfire]] series offered in previous years (1961\u201366) but with a standard 88 semi-fastback roofline rather than the Starfire's squared off roof with concave rear window.  Another styling cue for the Delta Custom was the addition of a second set of tail light reflectors set into the lower portion of the bumper.\n\nNew options for 1967 included front disc brakes, stereo [[8-track tape|8-track]] tape player and a Climate Combustion Control system for Rocket V8s designed to regulate carburetor air temperature, boost fuel economy, speed choke warm up and eliminate winter icing to permit easier starting and more efficient operation in cold weather.\n\nThe same assortment of 330 and 425 cubic-inch V8 engines were carried over from 1966, as were most transmission offerings except the optional four-speed manual with Hurst shifter, which was discontinued due to low buyer interest.\n\n[[File:1968 Oldsmobile Delta 88 Holiday Coupe.jpg|thumb|left|1968 Oldsmobile Delta 88 Holiday Coupe]]\nFor 1968, the overall design was a carry over.  New front end with split grille design that would become an Olds trademark in coming years highlighted all 1968 full-sized Oldsmobiles with horizontal lines on 88's and egg-crate patterns on Ninety-Eights, along with concealed windshield wipers.\n \nThe Delmont 88 got a larger 350 cubic-inch V8 as standard equipment and the optional V8 that was standard on Delta 88/Custom and Ninety-Eight was jacked up to 455 cubic inches with a {{Convert|390|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} W-33 option primarily designed as part of the division's police package available as an RPO on all 88's. Horsepower ratings of other Olds engines included 250 for the 350 two-barrel standard in the Delmont 88, 310 for the four-barrel 350 optional in the Delmont 88. A 455 two-barrel rated at {{convert|310|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} was standard on the Delta 88/Custom and optional on the Delmont 88. Optional on all 88s was a four-barrel 455 rated at {{convert|365|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} from the larger C-body Ninety-Eight. Both the 350 and 455 two-barrel Rocket V8 engines were designed to use regular gasoline while the optional 350 and 455 four-barrel carburated \"Ultra High Compression\" Super Rocket V8s required premium fuel.\n\n{{multiple image\n| direction = vertical\n| image1    = 69 Oldsmobile Delta 88 Royale (14529793202).jpg\n| image2    = 69 Oldsmobile Delta 88 Royale (14344226068).jpg\n| footer    = 1969 Oldsmobile Delta 88 Royale}}\nThe 1969 88 series dropped the Delmont name, leaving the Delta 88 as the base model of the series. The '''Delta 88 Royale''' trim, only available on a Holiday Coupe, was added as line-topper above the Delta 88 Custom. It came standard with a more luxurious interior featuring a notchback vinyl upholstered bench seat with armrest or Strato bucket seats with optional center console. For safety, a ceiling mounted shoulder belt was offered in the front seats for both the driver and right passenger. This arrangement provided five belt buckles in the front bench seat. The standard engine in the base Delta 88 was a 350 cu in, low compression ratio (9.0:1) Rocket V8 with a Rochester two-barrel carburetor that was rated at {{convert|250|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4,600&nbsp;rpm and {{convert|355|lb\u00b7ft|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque ran on leaded regular 94 RON gasoline. Standard on the Delta 88 Custom and Royale models and optional on the base series was a low compression two-barrel version of the 455 cubic-inch Rocket V8 rated at {{Convert|310|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} designed to use regular fuel. Optional on all Delta 88s was the four-barrel Ultra High Compression 455 cubic-inch Super Rocket V8 rated at {{Convert|365|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. Top option was the {{Convert|390|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} version of the four-barrel 455 V8 designed to run on 98 RON octane fuel available in all Delta 88 models as the W-33 option.\n\nThe two-speed Jetaway automatic that was previously offered as an option on the smaller engine 88 models was dropped completely in favor of the GM three-speed Turbo Hydra-Matic 400 transmission previously only offered with the larger engines. Also a new GM-designed Variable-Ratio Power Steering system was introduced as an option.\n\nAll full-sized Oldsmobiles were completely restyled for 1969 with more squared off bodylines and rooflines for the Holiday coupes and sedans replacing the semi-fastback look of 1967\u201368, and ventless front windows on all models. Wheelbases were increased by one-inch to {{convert|124|in|m}}. Though the 1969 models were extensively restyled, the basic 1965 chassis design and inner-body structure was retained along with the roofline on the pillared four-door Town sedans.\n\nInside, headrests were now standard equipment and a new instrument panel included square instruments replacing the round instruments of previous years along with a push-button operated ashtray and rotary glove compartment knob, as well as heating/air conditioning controls relocated from the center of the dash to the left of the steering wheel near the lights and wiper switches. The high-beam lights indicator was a red rocket located on the dash. Also new was a steering column-mounted ignition switch that also locked the steering wheel when not in use \u2013 a feature found on all 1969-model General Motors passenger cars, a year before locking steering columns were required by federal mandate starting in 1970.\n\n[[File:1970 Oldsmobile Delta 88 front.jpg|thumb|left|1970 Oldsmobile Delta 88 Town Sedan]]\nOnly detail changes were made for the 1970 full-sized Oldsmobiles including a new split grille that no longer extended to surround the headlights and a slightly revised rear section. Powertrain selections were carried over from 1969 with both 350 and 455 cubic-inch Rocket V8s now featuring \"Positive Valve Rotators\" for longer engine life and more efficient operation. A new antenna impregnated into the windshield was introduced this year that replaced the previous fender-mounted unit and was included as standard equipment on all cars equipped with a factory radio. New option this year was a wiper/washer switch mounted in the shift lever knob.  Optional radio was a stereo AM-FM radio and a lower dash mounted eight track tape player.\n\nThe 1965\u20131970 [[GM B platform]] is the fourth best selling automobile platform in history after the [[Volkswagen Beetle]], [[Ford Model T]] and the [[Lada Riva]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== Seventh generation (1971\u20131976) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name         = Seventh generation\n| image        = 1972 Oldsmobile Delta 88.jpg\n| caption      = 1972 Oldsmobile Delta 88 hardtop sedan\n| aka          = {{unbulleted list|Oldsmobile Delta 88|[[Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser]]}}\n| model_years  = 1971\u20131976\n| assembly     = {{unbulleted list|[[Fremont, California]]|[[Fairfax, Kansas]]|[[Framingham, Massachusetts]]|[[Lansing, Michigan]]|[[Linden, New Jersey]]|[[Arlington, Texas]]}}\n| body_style   = {{unbulleted list|2-door [[hardtop]]|2-door [[convertible]]|4-door hardtop|4-door [[Sedan (car)|sedan]]}}\n| layout       = [[Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout|FR layout]]\n| platform     = [[GM B platform|B-body]]\n| engine       = {{unbulleted list|{{convert|350|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Oldsmobile V8 engine|Rocket 350]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]]|{{convert|455|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Oldsmobile V8 engine#455|Rocket 455]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]]}}\n| related      = {{unbulleted list|[[Cadillac Deville]]|[[Buick LeSabre]] |[[Pontiac Bonneville]]|[[Pontiac Catalina|Pontiac Catalina/Laurentian]]|[[Pontiac Parisienne]]|[[Chevrolet Bel Air]]|[[Chevrolet Caprice]]|[[Chevrolet Impala]]}}\n| transmission = {{unbulleted list|3-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]|3-speed automatic|3-speed manual transmission}}\n| wheelbase    = {{convert|124.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n}}\n\n[[File:1971 Oldsmobile Delta 88 sedan.jpg|thumb|left|1971 Oldsmobile Delta 88 sedan]]\n[[File:Oldsmobile Delta 88 Royale convertible -- 07-03-2011 2.jpg|thumb|left|1972 Oldsmobile Delta 88 convertible]]\n[[File:1972 Oldsmobile Delta 88 Royale pic3.JPG|thumb|left|1972 Oldsmobile Delta 88 Royale convertible interior]]\n[[File:1972 Oldsmobile Delta 88 Royale Holiday Coupe (Centropolis Laval '10).jpg|thumb|left|1972 Oldsmobile Delta 88 Royale Holiday hardtop coupe]]\n[[File:Oldsmobile Delta 88 convertible.jpg|thumb|left|1973 Oldsmobile Delta 88 Royale convertible]]\n[[File:'75 Oldsmobile Convertible (Bagnoles au bord de l'eau '12).JPG|thumb|left|1975 Oldsmobile Delta 88 Royale convertible]]\n\nAll GM B-body full-size cars were completely restyled and enlarged for 1971, but continued to ride on a {{convert|124|in|mm|0|sing=on}} wheelbase. It reached its maximum size in 1974 at an astounding {{convert|226.9|in|mm|0|sing=on}} in length.  It was available as a pillared four-door Town Sedan, two-door and four-door Holiday hardtops and a convertible. Series models for 1971 included the base Delta 88, Delta 88 Custom and Delta 88 Royale, the latter inheriting the convertible body style previously offered on the base Delta 88. All models received fuselage styling somewhat similar to what Chrysler Corporation introduced on its 1969 models, and new rooflines with a more squared off greenhouse for Town sedans and more rounded lines for Holiday sedans and coupes \u2013 the latter receiving reverting to a semi-fastback format.\n\nAlso new for 1971 was the [[Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser|Custom Cruiser]] station wagon, the first full-sized Oldsmobile wagon since 1964. It used the 88's B-body platform with a longer {{convert|127|in|mm|adj=on}} wheelbase (matching the larger C-body Ninety-Eight) with multi-leaf spring suspensions that differed entirely from the all-coil suspensions used in sedans and coupes. The Custom Cruiser came standard with the larger 455 Rocket V8 and utilized the disappearing clamshell tailgate of other full-size GM wagons.\n\nEngine offerings again included 350 and 455-cubic-inch Rocket V8s ranging from 250 to 340 gross horsepower, all of which featured lowered compression ratios beginning in 1971 to enable use of lower octane regular leaded 91 RON octane, low-lead or unleaded gasoline. Vented power front disc brakes and variable-ratio power steering were now standard equipment on all 88 models. During the 1971 model year, the Turbo Hydra-matic 400 transmission was added to the standard equipment list.\n\nOther highlights for 1971 included a wrap-around instrument panel shared with Ninety-Eight and Toronado models (Toronados had a slightly smoother upper leading edge design) that was highlighted by a large square speedometer and all controls within easy reach of the driver, and a one-year only Flo-Through ventilation system that utilized vents in the trunklid. The system used on all GM B-, C- and E-body cars and the [[Chevrolet Vega]], used the heater fan to draw air into the car from the cowl intake, and force it out through vents in the trunk lid or tailgate. In theory, passengers could enjoy fresh air even when the car was moving slowly or stopped, as in heavy traffic. In practice, however, it didn't work.\n\n1971 was the last model year in which a 3-speed manual transmission was offered on full-sized Oldsmobiles; the rarely-ordered option was dropped in 1972.\n\nWithin weeks of the 1971 models' debut, however, Oldsmobile\u2014and all other GM dealers\u2014received multiple complaints from drivers who complained the ventilation system pulled cold air into the car before the heater could warm up\u2014and could not be shut off. The ventilation system was extensively revised for 1972.\n\nFor 1972, the Delta Custom series was dropped and the Royale series was expanded to include four-door Town and Holiday sedans. Advertised brake horsepower figures dropped to 155 for the base 350 two-barrel and 250 for the optional 455 four-barrel Rocket V8s thanks to an industry-wide switch in power measurements from the previous gross method (as measured by a dynamometer with no accessories attached) to the net method in which the power measurements were based upon an engine \"as installed\" in a vehicle with all emission controls and accessories hooked up. Only minor trim changes were made this year that included revised \"waterfall\" grilles in front and four-segment taillights in the rear. Inside a revised \"Flo-Through\" ventilation system utilizing vents in the [[doorjamb]]s replaced the 1971 version which utilized vents in the trunklid.\n\nFor 1973, wider and lower split waterfall grilles flanked a new federally mandated {{convert|5|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} front bumper on all Delta 88 models and larger one-piece rounded rectangular taillights replaced the four-segmented lights of 1972. Engine offerings included a standard 350 Rocket V8 with two-barrel carburetor (150 net horsepower) or optional 455 Rocket V8 with four-barrel carburetion and {{Convert|215|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} with single exhaust or {{Convert|250|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} with dual exhausts. Model offerings were the same as 1972 with the Delta 88 Royale series now including the sole Olds convertible offering following the demise of the intermediate Cutlass Supreme convertible after 1972.\n\nDirector [[Sam Raimi]] regularly includes a 1973 Delta 88 in his films. Referred to as \"The Classic\" by the filmmaker, the car originally belonged to his parents and has made an appearance in the ''[[Evil Dead]]'' trilogy, his ''[[Spider-Man in film|Spider-Man]]'' films with [[Tobey Maguire]], and ''[[Drag Me To Hell]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Drees|first1=Rich|title=The Classic: Sam Raimi And The 1973 Oldsmobile Delta 88|url=http://www.filmbuffonline.com/FBOLNewsreel/wordpress/2013/04/09/the-classic-sam-raimi-and-the-1973-oldsmobile-delta-88/|website=FilmBuffOnline|accessdate=12 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1974, a {{convert|5|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} rear bumper was added and taillights reverted to a four-segment design similar to 1972 and the front grilles were narrowed and raised to hood level similar to 1971\u201372 models. Also, new rooflines were featured on Holiday hardtop coupes with large fixed triangular side windows in the widened \"C\" pillar.  Unlike the big Chevrolet formal-roof coupes, the Olds retained a small roll-down rear window.  As Oldsmobile completely discontinued two-barrel carbureted engines this year, a new 350 four-barrel Rocket V8 (175 horsepower) became standard equipment with the 455 available as an option. Other highlights this year included an all-new flat instrument panel shared with Ninety-Eight and Toronado models with horizontal sweep speedometer and \"Message Center\" system of warning lights replacing the wrap-around dash of previous years. A new and seldom-ordered option available on all full-sized Olds models and Toronados was a driver's-side airbag \u2013 among the first to be offered in a production automobile. The Delta 88 Royale ragtop was again the only convertible offered by Olds.\n\nDetail changes for 1975 included revised grilles and taillights along with new rear quarter windows for pillared and Holiday sedans \u2013 the latter's design similar to an opera window in September 1974. The same assortment of 350 and 455-cubic-inch Rocket V8s were still offered along with a one-year-only (and seldom-ordered) option of a Pontiac-built 400-cubic-inch V8 with two-barrel carburetor and {{convert|170|hp}} rating. All engines were hooked up to a catalytic converter that not only mandated the use of unleaded gasoline but also spelled the end of dual exhaust systems. 1975 was the final year for the Delta 88 Royale convertible, the last of which was built on July 11, 1975. Just under 7200 Delta 88 Royale convertibles were built in 1975 as Oldsmobile made a concerted effort to target the convertible buyer market at the time. The headline on a print ad for a 1975 Olds Delta 88 Royale convertible stated, \"Today a beautiful Olds convertible. Tomorrow, a collector's item\". The featured car in the ad was a red Delta 88 Royale rag top.\n\nFor 1976, the final year of this generation, all Olds 88s received revised grille work, rectangular headlamps and parking lamps directly below instead of in the bumper, with Delta 88 Royale models also getting spring-loaded stand-up hood ornaments. It was also the final year for the Holiday hardtop coupes and sedans, along with the 455 Rocket V8 and the optional airbag system that would generally become universal on production cars and trucks some 15 years later. A one-year only option on Delta 88 Royale Holiday coupes was the Royale Crown Landau package that included a stainless steel roof bar, padded rear quarter vinyl roof, special hood ornament and color-keyed wheelcovers.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== Eighth generation (1977\u20131985) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name         = Eighth generation\n| image        = 81delta88.jpg\n| caption      = 1981 Oldsmobile Delta 88 sedan\n| aka          = Oldsmobile Delta 88\n| model_years  = 1977\u20131985\n| assembly     = {{unbulleted list|[[South Gate, California]]|[[Fairfax, Kansas]]|[[Lansing, Michigan]]|[[Detroit Assembly|Detroit, Michigan]]}}\n| body_style   = {{unbulleted list|2-door [[coupe]]|4-door [[Sedan (car)|sedan]]}}\n| layout       = [[Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout|FR layout]]\n| platform     = [[GM B platform|B-body]]\n| related      = {{unbulleted list|[[Buick Estate]]|[[Buick LeSabre]]|[[Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser]]|[[Oldsmobile 98]]|[[Pontiac Bonneville]]|[[Pontiac Catalina|Pontiac Catalina/Laurentian]]|[[Pontiac Parisienne]]|[[Pontiac Safari]]|[[Chevrolet Caprice]]|[[Chevrolet Impala]]}}\n| engine       = {{unbulleted list|{{convert|231|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Buick V6 engine#231|Buick 231]]'' [[V6 engine|V6]]|{{convert|260|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Oldsmobile V8 engine#260|LV8]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]]|{{convert|307|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Oldsmobile V8 engine#LV2|LV2]]'' V8|{{convert|350|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Oldsmobile V8 engine#L34|L34]]'' V8|{{convert|350|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Chevrolet small-block engine#LM1|LM1]]'' V8|{{convert|350|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Oldsmobile Diesel engine|LF9]]'' V8|{{convert|403|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Oldsmobile V8 engine#403|Olds 403]]'' V8}}\n| transmission = {{unbulleted list|3-speed ''[[Turbo-Hydramatic#THM350|TH350]]'' automatic|3-speed ''[[Turbo-Hydramatic#THM200|TH200]]'' automatic|4-speed ''[[Turbo-Hydramatic#200-4R|THM 200-4R]]'' automatic}}\n| wheelbase    = {{convert|116.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| length       = {{unbulleted list|{{convert|217.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (1977\u201379)|{{convert|218.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (1980\u201385)<ref>{{cite book|title=World Cars 1982|publisher=Herald Books|isbn=0-910714-14-2}}</ref>}}\n| width        = {{convert|76.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| height       = {{unbulleted list|{{convert|55.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (coupe)|{{convert|55.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (sedan)}}\n}}\n\n[[File:Oldsmobile Delta 88 Coupe.JPG|thumb|left|1977 Oldsmobile Delta 88 coupe]]\n[[File:1983 Olds Delta 88 Royale.jpg|thumb|left|1983 Oldsmobile Delta 88 Royale sedan, rear view]]\n[[File:1984 Oldsmobile Royale 88, Dutch licence registration 67-LKP-9 p4.JPG|thumb|left|1984 Oldsmobile Delta 88 Royale hood emblem]]\n\nThe 1977 Delta 88s and other GM B-body cars were considerably downsized from their predecessors in length and wheelbase ({{convert|116|in|mm|abbr=on}} \u2013 the same as the four-door 1973\u201377 A-body Cutlass Sedan) and nearly {{convert|900|lb|abbr=on}} lighter in weight, with curb weights dropping to between {{convert|3500|and|3600|lb|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} depending on model.<ref name='77Specs'>{{cite book |title=1977 Oldsmobile Specs Book |publisher=[[Oldsmobile|Oldsmobile Motor Division]] |date=August 1976 |location=Lansing, Michigan}}</ref> Other than a reduction in shoulder room, however, interior room was not adversely affected; in fact, headroom and rear seat legroom increased. Both base Delta 88 and Royale models were now only offered in two pillared body styles; a two-door coupe and a four-door Town Sedan. The 1977\u20131979 '''[[Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser|Custom Cruiser]]''' was now based on the Delta 88's B-body rather than the Ninety-Eight's C-body (thus also sharing the coil spring suspension, rather than the multi-[[leaf spring]]) and came with a two-way tailgate rather than the clamshell of 1971\u201376 models. A fuel economy gauge was optional.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Oldsmobile/1977%20Oldsmobile/1977_Oldsmobile_Full_Size_Brochure/1977%20Oldsmobile%20Full%20Size-23.html |title=1977 Oldsmobile Sales Brochure, Full-size Cars |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-08}}</ref>\n\nThe standard engine was now a {{convert|231|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V6 engine|Buick V6]] with a [[Turbo-Hydramatic#THM200|Turbo-Hydramatic 200]] [[automatic transmission]].<ref name='77Service'>{{cite book |title=1977 Oldsmobile Service Manual |publisher=[[Oldsmobile|Oldsmobile Motor Division]] |year=1977 |location=Lansing, Michigan}}</ref> An [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#260|Oldsmobile 260]] was the base V8, followed by either a Chevrolet 350 (option code LM1) or Oldsmobile 350 (option code L34). Initially, the Oldsmobile engine came in California and high-altitude cars, the Chevrolet engine came in cars with Federal emissions equipment.<ref name='77Specs'/> The Olds engine returned later in the model year. Oldsmobile's new 403 was the top engine option and came with a [[Turbo-Hydramatic#THM350|THM350]] transmission.\n\nThe use of a Chevrolet engine caused a situation known as the \"Chevy-mobile\" affair. GM settled with some Oldsmobile owners by offering them warranty extensions for the Chevrolet-engined Oldsmobiles, or the option of returning those cars in exchange for an Oldsmobile with a genuine Rocket V8. The \"return car\" option wasn't commonly chosen, because the owner had to pay GM for mileage driven, which could become expensive. This began the era of \"corporate\" engines, and for many years GM advertisements would include a disclaimer stating '\"Oldsmobiles (or other divisions) are equipped with engines manufactured by various GM divisions, subsidiaries and affiliates worldwide.\"'\n\nAs in previous years, base Delta 88 and Royale models differed mainly in exterior and interior trim. Base Deltas had a full bench seat available in cloth-and-vinyl or all-vinyl upholstery, while Royales had a notchback bench seat with armrest or optional 60/40 notchback bench, also available in cloth-and-vinyl or all-vinyl trim. All 88s featured an all-new instrument panel with a horizontal sweep speedometer and heater/air conditioning controls moved to the center of the dash above the radio from the left side of the dash, and continued with the \"Message Center\" bank of warning lights. The new dash was highlighted with woodgrain trim. The dimmer switch moved from the floor to the turn-signal lever.\n\nFor 1978, a '''Holiday 88''' coupe was added to the lineup, featuring Strato bucket seats along with console and floor shifter, Super Stock wheels and two-tone paint schemes. All 88 models received new grilles and revised taillights with drivetrains the same as 1977 except for the addition of the 350 Diesel V8 to the option list.\n\nThe 1979 model year saw the addition of a new Delta 88 Royale Brougham series added to the line, which included plush \"pillowed\" seat trim similar to the Ninety-Eight. All models again received revised grilles and other minor changes. It was the last year for the 403 [[V8 engine|V8]] as federal fuel-economy mandates spelled the end of larger engines in order to meet those requirements.\n\nFor 1980, all 88s got new and more aerodynamic sheetmetal for improved fuel economy highlighted by rounded square taillights similar to mid-70s 88s, but overall dimensions stayed the same and coupes received a revised roofline. New to the engine lineup was the {{convert|307|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} Rocket V8 with four-barrel carburetor and {{convert|150|hp}}. All other engines except the now-discontinued 403 were carried over from 1979.\n\nOnly minor grille and taillight lens revisions highlighted the 1981 Delta 88s. The gasoline 350 Rocket V8 was dropped from the option list, leaving only the diesel version available. All other engines including the Buick 231 V6 and Oldsmobile 260 and 307 Rocket V8s were continued. All gasoline engines received GM's new '''Computer Command Control''' engine management system. This system was the forerunner of today's [[OBD-II]] which is standard on all cars sold in the United States. The system read various parameters such as vehicle speed, throttle position, engine speed, coolant temperature, and the oxygen content of the exhaust to provide the correct air/fuel mixture for any given driving condition. Also new for 1981 was GM's [[Turbo-Hydramatic#200-4R|Turbo-Hydramatic 200-4R]] transmission, which added an overdrive gear and torque converter clutch (TCC) to contribute to fuel economy and engine longevity. The sporty Holiday 88 coupe was offered for the last time this year.\n\nThe 1982 model year saw only minor trim changes for Delta 88, Royale and Royale Brougham models. The same assortment of engines/transmissions were carried over from previous years though the small 260 V8 was offered for the last time. For 1983, all Oldsmobile 88s received new grilles, hood ornaments and minor trim revisions including new steering wheels. This would be the last year for the base Delta 88 line, leaving only the Royale and Royale Brougham after this year. Engine offerings were down to three, a standard Buick 231 cubic-inch [[V6]], or optional Oldsmobile V8s including the 307 Rocket and 350 Diesel.\n\nFor 1984, all Delta 88s were now '''Royale''' or '''Royale Brougham''' models. Styling highlights included new grille inserts and red and amber taillights replacing the red lenses. At mid-year, a new Royale Brougham LS was added to the 88 line almost simultaneous to the introduction of a new and downsized 1985 [[front-wheel drive]] [[Oldsmobile 98|Ninety-Eight]]. With the Ninety-Eight being downsized and converted to front-drive, the '''Royale Brougham LS''' model of the 88 was now the largest and most luxurious [[rear-wheel drive]] car offered by Oldsmobile. Custom Cruiser wagons continued with the same styling changes found on other 88 models.\n\n[[File:81-85 Oldsmobile Delta 88.jpg|thumb|left|1985 Oldsmobile Delta 88 Royale sedan]]\n\nOnly minor changes marked the 1985 model, which was in its last year before a major downsizing and conversion to [[front-wheel-drive]]. The same assortment of models in the Royale, Brougham and Brougham LS continued as before. The '85 88s would be the last full-sized Oldsmobile sedans and coupes to feature rear-wheel-drive, Rocket V8 power, and body-on-frame construction. Though the 88 [[Sedan (car)|sedans]] and [[coupe]]s were downsized and switched to front-drive for 1986, the Custom Cruiser [[station wagon]]s would continue virtually unchanged through the 1990 model year and eventually become the only Oldsmobile model powered by an Oldsmobile Rocket [[V8 engine|V8]] engine, for which production ended in 1990 after 42 years.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== Ninth generation (1986\u20131991) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name        = Ninth generation\n| image       = Oldsmobile Eighty-Eight -- 08-28-2009.jpg\n| caption     = 1990 Oldsmobile Eighty Eight Royale sedan\n| aka         = {{unbulleted list|Oldsmobile Delta 88 (1986\u201388)|Oldsmobile Eighty Eight Royale (1989\u201391)}}\n| model_years = 1986\u20131991\n| assembly    = {{unbulleted list|[[Flint, Michigan]]|[[Ypsilanti, Michigan]]|[[Wentzville, Missouri]]}}\n| body_style  = {{unbulleted list|2-door [[coupe]]|4-door [[Sedan (car)|sedan]]}}\n| layout      = [[Transverse engine|Transverse]] [[Front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout|front-engine, front-wheel drive]]\n| platform    = [[GM H platform (FWD)|H-body]]\n| related     = {{unbulleted list|[[Buick LeSabre]]|[[Pontiac Bonneville]]}}\n| engine      = 3.8 L ''[[Buick V6 engine#3.8 FWD LG2/LG3|Buick LG3]]'' [[V6 engine|V6]]<small>{{Collapsible list\n | title       = Specifications \n | frame_style = border:none;

The headlights changed from square sealed beam quads to integrated regular/high beam composite lamps in 1987. A few [[NASCAR]] teams built racecars with 1986 Delta 88 sheetmetal and ran them on the circuit in the 86-88 seasons, but only one victory (with [[Terry Labonte]]) was scored.\n\nDue to the federal mandate to add passive restraints, door mounted seat belts were added for 1987. For 1988, rear shoulder belts were added. For 1989, the \"Delta\" name was dropped, as was the hood ornament, leaving the model to simply become the \"Eighty Eight,\" now spelled out instead of using the \"88\" in numerical form, and deleted the amber color from the taillights. A driver airbag became an available option.\n\nThe Eighty Eight was given a mild facelift in 1990, eliminating the former chromed grille for a body-colored fascia with four slots and the Oldsmobile Rocket logo.  In the rear, new taillights and backup lights extended across the body; once again, chrome trim was deleted. Minor revisions were also made to the interior. Part of the door panel was revised and 1990 also offered new cloth for the seats. The Pillow Cushion seats on the Brougham were deleted. A revised armrest console was also added, this one provided more room. As an option was a revised electronic climate control system. A new choice of alloy wheels was an option.\n\n1991 was the last year for the coupe.  The model range during this time was the standard Eighty Eight, the Eighty Eight Royale, and the Eighty Eight Royale Brougham, in ascending order. <ref>http://www.lov2xlr8.no/brochures/olds/90olds/14.html</ref><ref>http://www.lov2xlr8.no/brochures/olds/86omo/bilder/10.jpg</ref><ref>http://www.lov2xlr8.no/brochures/olds/86omo/bilder/11.jpg</ref>\n\n'''Engines:'''\n* 1986\u20131988.5 \u2013 3.8 L (231&nbsp;in\u00b3) [[Buick V6 engine#3.8 FWD|LG3]] [[V6]]\n* 1988.5\u20131991 \u2013 3.8 L (231&nbsp;in\u00b3) [[Buick V6 engine#3800 V6|3800]] LN3 [[V6]]\n\n'''Transmissions:'''\n* 1986\u20131988.5 \u2013 440-T4 4-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic overdrive]]\n* 1988.5\u20131991 \u2013 4T60 4-speed automatic overdrive\n\n=== Voice diagnostic system ===\nThis generation of Delta 88s had an optional voice diagnostic system that alerted the driver of problems.<ref>1989 Oldsmobile full-line sales catalog: The New Generation of Oldsmobile</ref> The voice was male and computer synthesized.\n\nIn the event of a warning, the door chime played three times rapidly and then played the voice alert.

This was the last '''Eighty Eight''' or '''88''' model from Oldsmobile (along with its performance '''LSS''' and '''Regency''' models) before being discontinued in 1999 and being replaced in 2001 with the Aurora. The 3.8&nbsp;L Buick V6 was still the only engine, but output increased to {{convert|170|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|220|lb\u00b7ft|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque.\n\nThe Eighty-Eight's front and rear were restyled for 1996, and with it the nomenclature was changed from \"Eighty Eight Royale\" to three models \u2013 '''Eighty Eight''', '''Eighty Eight LS''' and '''LSS''' (A \"Luxury Sports Sedan\" targeted to male European car buyers, available with a supercharged [[V6]] and a floor mounted gear shifter).  It is important to note, however, early LSS models (1995) were rarely equipped with the 3800 Supercharged engine.  The LSS was an originally a trim level package on the 88 starting in 1992. In 1996 the LSS received Aurora-inspired seats. 1996 was the final year that the original-style rocket (in black and silver) appeared on a hood emblem. 1997 would welcome the new Oldsmobile logo on all Eighty-Eight trims except the Regency.<ref>http://www.lov2xlr8.no/brochures/olds/95_88/95_88.html</ref>\n\nAfter the demise of the [[Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight|Ninety-Eight]] in 1996, Oldsmobile added the '''Regency''' to the 1997 and 1998 lineups, which used the same front fenders and chrome grille as the Ninety-Eight sedan but kept the standard Eighty-Eight body. The Regency featured a long list of standard features including traction control, leather upholstery, dual 6-way power seats with power lumbar and a driver's side memory function, a dual-zone automatic climate control system, and an electronic level control for the rear suspension. A driver's side [[electrochromic]] outside mirror was also standard on the Regency, a feature that even [[Cadillac]] didn't offer as standard equipment. The interior day/night auto-dimming mirror was linked to the outside mirror and dimmed both with the same intensity at the same time. Some of these options, like the 2-driver memory feature, were not available on the Eighty-Eight Royale or LSS. \n\nTo commemorate the 50th anniversary of the 88/Eighty-Eight nameplate, Oldsmobile offered a special 50th Anniversary Edition of the 1999 Eighty-Eight. This edition included front and rear leather bench seats from the 98/Regency, steering wheel with audio and HVAC controls, the older rocket logo, electronic climate control unit, gold plated badges, and special Anniversary badges on the C-pillars and front door panels.\n\nAll four vehicles used the same {{convert|110.8|in|mm|abbr=on}} wheelbase and shared an updated version of the [[GM H platform (FWD)|H-body]]. The suspension tuning, interior appointments, and certain exterior trim was used to differentiate the three models.\n\n'''Engines:'''\n* 1992\u20131994 3.8&nbsp;L (231&nbsp;in\u00b3) [[Buick V6 engine#Series I|3800 Series I]] [[V6]], {{convert|170|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}\n* 1995\u20131999 3.8&nbsp;L (231&nbsp;in\u00b3) [[Buick V6 engine#Series II|3800 Series II]] V6, {{convert|205|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}\n* 1995 3.8&nbsp;L (231&nbsp;in\u00b3) [[Buick V6 engine#L67 Supercharged|supercharged 3800 Series I]] V6, {{convert|225|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} which was only installed on 100 vehicles of its kind.\n* 1996\u20131999 3.8&nbsp;L (231&nbsp;in\u00b3) [[Buick V6 engine#Series II|supercharged 3800 Series II]] V6, {{convert|240|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}\n\nFrom 1992 to 1999, Eighty Eight models were produced in [[Lake Orion, Michigan]], [[Flint, Michigan]], and [[Wentzville, Missouri]].<ref>https://www.copart.com/lot/32443257/Photos</ref>\n\n'''Year-to-year changes:'''\n* 1992: The redesign. Models included the Eighty-Eight Royale and the Eighty-Eight Royale LS. The 1992 full line Oldsmobile factory brochure makes brief mention of the LSS (Luxury Sport Sedan) model in one small photo, yet it doesn't appear later in the options summary. \n* 1993: Trunk mounted key cover emblem removed. The Eight Eight LSS returned with better factory promotion of its sporty option package that included: Bucket seats (a pair of right-hand halves of the standard 60/40 split bench seat), steering wheel audio and HVAC controls, floor shifter and center console (borrowed from the previous generation Pontiac Bonneville SSE) in the interior, and full instrumentation for the dash. Sixteen inch alloy wheels, higher spring rates and larger diameter stabilizer bars for the front and rear suspension gave the LSS a firm ride and more controlled handling. \n* 1994: The first facelift: Front grille and headlamps were redesigned, 'sculpted' aluminum turbine rims were made available.  A major redesign to the dash added a passenger side airbag and made it less cluttered and more modern. \n* 1995: The 3.8L [[V6 engine]] was bumped from {{convert|170|hp|abbr=on}} to {{convert|205|hp|abbr=on}}.  All models shared this same 3.8L engine. The optional L67 3800 Supercharged engine, making {{convert|225|hp|abbr=on}}, was made an available option for the LSS, and later other models. First OEM GPS system introduced by any manufacturer, as an option the Oldsmobile Guidestar.<ref>http://autosofinterest.com/2015/05/01/1995-oldsmobile-guidestar-navigation-system/</ref>\n* 1996: The second facelift: New front grille and new round headlights, all body trim was changed to give the car a cleaner, more aerodynamic appearance.  Tailamps and rear reflector bar were slightly reshaped.  All models were renamed from ''Eighty Eight Royale'' to ''Eighty Eight'' and ''Eighty Eight LS'' ([LS] which migrated from an 88 Royale trim).  The LSS continued with the same changes to the exterior as other models, the addition of Aurora styled seats, but the same center console was retained for one more year. The supercharged LSS engine was bumped from {{convert|225|hp|abbr=on}} to {{convert|240|hp|abbr=on}}.\n* 1997: An upscale, \"fully loaded\" version of the Eighty-Eight was introduced as the ''Oldsmobile Regency'' to satisfy previous [[Oldsmobile 98#1991\u20131996|Ninety-Eight]] buyers. All Oldsmobile Eighty Eight and LSS models (except for the Regency) changed badges from the '80s Oldsmobile \"Rocket\" logo to the 1997\u20132004 Oldsmobile \"Rocket Oval\" logo, inspired by the Aurora's logo. The center console on bucket seat cars was also redesigned to fit up against the lower part of the dash, allowed for rear passenger vents, and 2 cup holders for front the occupants.\n* 1998: Last year for the Regency which kept the old \"Rocket\" logo. The last Oldsmobile Regency rolled off the assembly line on June 18, 1998.\n* 1999: Last year for both Eighty Eight and LSS models. This was also the last Oldsmobile sedan to have 6-passenger seating as an option. The last Oldsmobile LSS was produced on September 23, 1998. The last Oldsmobile Eighty Eight 50th Anniversary Edition was manufactured on January 6, 1999.\n\n===Oldsmobile Guidestar===\n\nThe Guidestar system was designed off of the previous TravTek [[Automotive_navigation_system|GPS]] that Oldsmobile developed with [[Avis_Rent_a_Car|Avis]] and [[American_Automobile_Association|AAA]],that was tested in the 1990-1992 [[Oldsmobile_Toronado|Oldsmobile Toronado Trofeo]]. Once the Toronado was discontinued after 1992, the Oldsmobile division continued working on the system as the Guidestar using the newly acquired [[Hughes_Electronics|Hughes Electronics division]]  and [[Electronic_Data_Systems|EDS]]. The Oldsmobile Guidestar was a hard disk-based system  that offered satellite navigation for 17 states but lacked live traffic updates. The states were California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Virginia.

They completed the original pavilion plan though their detailed design was contemporary. They were built to commemorate the death of [[Queen Victoria]] and were funded by donations. The two Pavilions were built 1901\u20131904 to a design by the Government Architect in consultation with Mansfield Brothers. The original design is shown on drawings PH213/142, 164 which are signed by W. L. Vernon as Government Architect and by George Oakeshott.

Subsequent alterations included the enclosure of the balconies to form corridors and some sub-division of the wards.<ref name=shi />\n\nIn 1907 the operating theatres were completed incorporating the latest design and technology. An undated drawing PH213/48 shows alterations to the operating theatre. The interior is shown in an early photograph. Due to insufficient funds some wards remained closed for some years and nurses were accommodated on the top floor. In 1914 the top two floors were used as accommodation for nurses. Between 1918 and 1926, returned soldiers were accommodated on these floors and the [[Department of Defence (Australia)|Department of Defence]] funded and equipped the wards.<ref name=shi />\n\nThere have been various subsequent alterations and additions, particularly on the eastern and southern sides. part of the original building was demolished in {{circa}} 1935 to build the Fairfax Institute of Pathology fronting Missenden Road. In 1937 a new [[X-ray]] department was established in a single storey brick, flat roofed addition at the rear of the Victoria Pavilion. In 1956 lifts were installed in the building. In 1966 there were further additions to accommodate new equipment including additional storey on the 1937 additions.
