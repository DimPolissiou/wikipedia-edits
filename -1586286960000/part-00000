The squadron was disestablished on 22 May 2012.\n\n== Squadron History ==\n\n=== 1950s ===\nFleet Air Reconnaissance in the European Theater had been conducted since the start of the Cold War by detachments within patrol squadrons (VP) flying modified PB4Y-2 Privateers from [[Naval Air Station Port Lyautey|NAS Port Lyautey]] and conducting missions in the Baltic, Black, Mediterranean, and North Seas. Shortly after the start of the Korean War in 1950, a dedicated unit, Naval Air Activities (NAA), Port Lyautey Patrol Unit (NPU) was established with three PB4Y-2 aircraft and personnel transferred from VP-26. As this unit demonstrated its value to the Navy, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and the Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) came to realize that a dedicated aircraft was a necessity. \n\nBy 1952, the VP community had not had much success with the [[Martin P4M Mercator|P-4M-1 Mercator]]  that it had deployed to Morocco due to maintenance issues arising from its nineteen airframe total production run. The rest of the VP community found easier maintenance with the Lockheed P2V Neptunes deployed in theater because that airframe had been adopted as the VP standard asset. The maritime patrol commanders removed them from frontline service at Lyautey in favor of the Neptune.  Washington subsequently decided to reconfigure all but one P4M-1 as P4M-1Qs and permanently assign them to the Naval Communications Units established at NPU and its sister unit at Sangley Point, Philippines.\n\nIn 1953, with the conversion and deployment of the P4M-1Q, NPU needed  an administrative identity as part of the Naval Air Force Atlantic (AIRLANT) structure and Airborne Early Warning Squadron TWO (VW-2) at NAS Patuxent River became the command into which NPU was folded as VW-2 DET A. Since VW-2 Det A's mission began to diverge greatly from the parent unit's VW mission, the Navy decided to establish dedicated squadrons for the Fleet Air Reconnaissance mission. One was to be formed from VW-2 Det A and the other would be formed from its siter unit at Sangley, VW-1 Det A.\n\nVQ-2 was commissioned as [[Electronic countermeasure|Electronic Countermeasures]] Squadron TWO (ECMRON TWO) on September 1, 1955 to provide the United States with an improved defense posture. The squadron took over VW-2 DET A's spcaes and hangar at NAS Port Lyautey.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Fleet Air  Reconnaissance Squadron TWO|url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/navy/vq-2.htm|website = www.globalsecurity.org|accessdate = 2015-11-06}}</ref> Through the 1950s, VQ-2 would continue to fly missions throughout the European Theater operating from Cyprus, Germany, Libya, Turkey, and the United Kingdom.\n\n[[File:Martin P4M Mercator VQ-2 06.09.56.jpg|thumb|left|P4M-1Q Mercator of VQ-2 electronics reconnaissance squadron in September 1956 - note extra radar 'bulges' on this variant]]\n\nThe squadron continued using the P4M-1Qs as mission aircraft.

The United States, in turn, was to be permitted to construct and to utilize air and naval bases on Spanish territory ([[Naval Station Rota]], [[Mor\u00f3n Air Base]], [[Torrej\u00f3n Air Base]], and [[Zaragoza Air Base]]). By 1959, the base at Rota and its airfield had been completed to satisfy the US Navy's aviation needs. Due to its newer facilities, the Navy decided to move VQ-2 to Rota.\n\n=== 1960s ===\nWhile keeping the alphanumeric designation VQ-2, EMCRON TWO was renamed Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron TWO (FAIRECONRON TWO) on January 1, 1960. Its sister squadron, [[VQ-1]] was similarly renamed. That month, the squadron was transferred to NS Rota, Spain.\n\nShortly after the change of homeport, on 19 January 1960, the squadron lost one of its P4M-1Qs and all sixteen aircrew when it crashed into a mountainside at 9,000 feet om approach to crashed on approach to [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik AFB]]. The crew had been flying in to relieve the detachment that had been operating there. Shortly thereafter, the P4M-1Q aircraft started being replaced by the [EC-121 Warning Star|Lockheed WV-2Q Warning Star]]. \n[[File:Lockheed EC-121M VQ-2.jpg|left|thumb|A U.S. Navy Lockheed EC-121M Warning Star of VQ-2.]]\n\nIn response to the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], VQ-2 flew missions in West Germany along the border with Czechoslovakia and East Germany as well as their routine missions into the Baltic. By now these were being carried out primarily by the WV-2Qs and A3D-2Qs. Tensions continued to increase as the Kennedy administration and its NATO allies responded to Soviet moves in Europe.\n\nOn 22 May, 1962, a WV-2Q (BUNO 131390)<ref name=\"DeanBoys\">{{Cite web|title = Dean Boys' History of EC-121|url =http://www.dean-boys.com/ec-121.htm|website = www.dean-boys.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> staged at [[Lucius D.

All fifteen Navy and four Army aircrew were killed.\n\nIn October 1962, the WV-2Q was redesignated the EC-121M Super Constellation.<ref name=\":0\" /> and in the same month the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] developed. Since the Navy had no comparable reconnaissance assets available in the Continental United States (CONUS), VQ-2 deployed an EA3B and an EC-121M to [[NAS Key West]] to provide those services around Cuba.\n\nThe [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 186|Cyprus Crisis in 1964]] saw an increase in international tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean. This led to an increase in EC-121M and EA-3B presence in the Levant. EA-3Bs in the Mediterranean still operated from land despite the increasing demand to man detachments onboard Sixth Fleet aircraft carriers.\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, the squadron deployed detachments to augment  VQ-1's support of US Navy operations in and around Vietnam under CINCPACFLT operational control. In late summer 1965, VQ-2 established DET ALFA at [[NAS Cubi Point]], Philippines. Sorties were routinely flown into the theater to support Seventh Fleet. After it sister squadron, [[VQ-1]], established its DET BRAVO flying from [[Da Nang]] Air Base in South Vietnam, VQ-2 EA-3Bs infrequently joined them operating as VQ-2 DET BRAVO. From both locations VQ-2 Whales provided continuous electronic reconnaissance capability over the area, including the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] and [[Gulf of Tonkin]]. As combat operations from CTF 77 on [[Yankee Station]] into North Vietnamese airspace increased, VQ-2 joined VQ-1 in deploying EA-3Bs to the attack carriers in theater. VQ-2 ceased operations from Da Nang in 1969, but continued to deploy to the aircraft carriers and Cubi Point.\n\nThe squadron suffered three fatal Whale losses between 1966 and 1968:\n# On 3 November 1966, an EA-3B (BUNO 146458)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> disappeared inbound to a recovery on the USS Independence in the central Mediterranean off [[Sicily]]. All six aircrew were lost at sea.\n# On 28 May 1966, an EA-3B Skywarrior (BUNO 142257) of DET ALFA, ran into a typhoon enroute Vietnam. Four of the aircrew bailed out as the three in the cockpit managed to recover the aircraft. The aircraft with the pilot, navigator and crew chief made it back to DET ALFA. The other four perished with only one body recovered and the personal effects of the other three.<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /><ref name=\"StaHypo\" />\n# On 4 June 1968, an EA-3B (BUNO 142670)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" />, flown by the new (by barely beyond a month)squadron CO, CDR T.E. Daum, crashed on takeoff from Rota on a flight to a conference in [[Naples, Italy]]. The Whale lost an engine just after takeoff descended slowly until hitting the ground on the down slope of a hill cartwheeling into a sugar beet field approximately one mile east of the Rota runway. CDR Daum and three of his department heads who were aboard were killed. The crew chief and another petty officer survived.

This incident kept the high tempo of operations in the Eastern Mediterranean despite a cesation of strife in Cyprus. As the decade came to a close, VQ-2 found itself operating all over Europe as well as in Southeast Asia.\n\n=== 1970s ===\n[[File:EP-3E Orion of VQ-2 parked c1971.jpg|thumb|EP-3E Aries of VQ-2 parked in 1971]]\nOn 26 February 1970, an EA-3B (BUNO 144851)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> was lost while operating from [[USS Franklin D.

The A3D-1Q was replaced by the A3D-2Q and was subsequently re-designated the EA-3B Skywarrior.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 31 July 1971, the squadron received its first delivery of the [[Lockheed EP-3|EP-3E Aries]] aircraft.<ref name=\":0\" /> This relatively newer airframe gave the squadron a more reliable platform due to its commonality with the VP P-3s and the availability of parts.\n\nIncreasing terrorism related to strife in the Middle East and the increasing Libyan radicalization after the 1969 coup led to a continued high operational tempo. Tensions came to a head with the 1973 Yom Kippur War. This tempo lasted through the decade despite the overall drawdown of the US military after Vietnam.\n\nOn 9 July 1974, the squadron suffered another A-3 loss when its VIP transport-configured A-3, a TA-3B (BUNO 144863)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> crashed at [[Naples International Airport|Capodichino]] in Naples, Italy on approach. All eight aircrew perished in the crash.\n\nThroughout the remainder of the 1970s, the command suffered no aircraft losses. In 1979, the [[Iranian Revolution]] saw an increased US Presence in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. In response, the Navy maintained at least one carrier battle group in the vicinity of the Gulf. VQ-2 shared the manning of carrier and Diego Garcia detachments.<ref>http://www.coldwar.org/histories/HistoryofUSNavyFleetAirReconnaissancePartTwo.asp</ref> This manning would continue until the third phase of the [[Lebanese Civil War]] in 1982.\n\n=== 1980s ===\n[[File:EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on USS Saratoga (CV-60) c1986.jpg|left|thumb|EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS]] Saratoga inn 1986.]]\nAs VQ-2 entered the mid-1980s, the frenzied pace of operations including [[Operation Mole Cricket 19]](Arab-Israel [[Beqaa Valley|Beqaa]] War), and continuing with 1982 - 1983 [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|Beirut Crisis]] with the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing|U.S. Marine barracks bombing]], and the [[United States Sixth Fleet|Sixth Fleet]] December [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|1983 air strike into Lebanon]], allowed little leisure time for the squadron.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nVQ-2 was awarded the [[Navy Expeditionary Medal]] for participation in the Beirut evacuation and operations in the vicinity of [[Libya]] during [[1986 United States bombing of Libya|Operation El Dorado Canyon]], 12\u201317 April 1986.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 25 January 1987, an EA-3B crashed on the USS Nimitz killing all seven crew members.\n\n=== 1990s ===\nIn the summer of 1990, the squadron provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of 2000 non-combatant personnel from war-stricken [[Liberia]] in [[operation Sharp Edge]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Lockheed EP-3E Orion (ARIES), USA - Navy AN2094464.jpg|thumb|EP-3E of VQ-2 based at Rota, Spain, seen arriving for [[Royal International Air Tattoo|RIAT]] '92.]]\nFrom August 1990 to April 1991, VQ-2 provided combat reconnaissance during operations [[Gulf War|Desert Shield/Desert Storm]], Proven Force, and [[Operation Provide Comfort|Provide Comfort]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 29 June 1991, the first EP-3E Aries II aircraft arrived in Rota and on 20 September 1991, the squadron retired the EA-3B Skywarrior the same year.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStarting in July 1992, VQ-2 flew support missions with Operations [[Operation Deny Flight|Deny Flight]], Provide Promise, Sharp Guard, Joint Endeavor, Decisive Endeavor, and Deliberate Guard providing combat reconnaissance and intelligence to [[NATO]] and [[United Nations]] forces in the Former [[Yugoslavia]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs of 1997, VQ-2 operated four EP-3E Aries II aircraft and two [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3C Orion]] aircraft from its home-base at Rota and two-plane detachment at [[Souda Bay|Naval Support Activity Souda Bay, Crete]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn March 1997, VQ-2 provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of non-combatant personnel from [[Albania]] following unrest from a failed [[Pyramid scheme|pyramid savings scheme]] during [[Operation Silver Wake]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== 2000s ===\nVQ-2 relocated from NS Rota, Spain, to NAS Whidbey Island, effective 1 September 2005.

Shortly thereafter, the P4M-1Q aircraft started being replaced by the [EC-121 Warning Star|Lockheed WV-2Q Warning Star]]. \n[[File:Lockheed EC-121M VQ-2.jpg|left|thumb|A U.S. Navy Lockheed EC-121M Warning Star of VQ-2.]]\n\nIn response to the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], VQ-2 flew missions in West Germany along the border with Czechoslovakia and East Germany as well as their routine missions into the Baltic. By now these were being carried out primarily by the WV-2Qs and A3D-2Qs. Tensions continued to increase as the Kennedy administration and its NATO allies responded to Soviet moves in Europe.\n\nOn 22 May, 1962, a WV-2Q (BUNO 131390)<ref name=\"DeanBoys\">{{Cite web|title = Dean Boys' History of EC-121|url =http://www.dean-boys.com/ec-121.htm|website = www.dean-boys.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> staged at [[Lucius D. Clay Kaserne|Wiesbaden Air Base]], took off from [[F\u00fcrstenfeldbruck Air Base]] on a training flight. Inflight, the rear cargo door opened causing the tail to separate from the remainder of the fuselage at the main cargo door. The main fuselage and tail section crashed southwest of [[Markt Schwaben]].<ref name=\"StaHypo\">{{Cite web|title = History Of VQ-2. Part 3]|url = https://stationhypo.com/2018/09/05/history-of-vq-2-part-3-of-5/|website = stationhypo.com|accessdate = 2018-09-28}}</ref><ref name=\"VQH\">{{Cite web|title = VQ History|url =http://vqassociation.org/history/|website = vqassociation.org|accessdate = 2016-07-22}}</ref>. All fifteen Navy and four Army aircrew were killed.\n\nIn October 1962, the WV-2Q was redesignated the EC-121M Super Constellation.<ref name=\":0\" /> and in the same month the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] developed. Since the Navy had no comparable reconnaissance assets available in the Continental United States (CONUS), VQ-2 deployed an EA3B and an EC-121M to [[NAS Key West]] to provide those services around Cuba.\n\nThe [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 186|Cyprus Crisis in 1964]] saw an increase in international tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean. This led to an increase in EC-121M and EA-3B presence in the Levant. EA-3Bs in the Mediterranean still operated from land despite the increasing demand to man detachments onboard Sixth Fleet aircraft carriers.\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, the squadron deployed detachments to augment  VQ-1's support of US Navy operations in and around Vietnam under CINCPACFLT operational control. In late summer 1965, VQ-2 established DET ALFA at [[NAS Cubi Point]], Philippines. Sorties were routinely flown into the theater to support Seventh Fleet. After it sister squadron, [[VQ-1]], established its DET BRAVO flying from [[Da Nang]] Air Base in South Vietnam, VQ-2 EA-3Bs infrequently joined them operating as VQ-2 DET BRAVO. From both locations VQ-2 Whales provided continuous electronic reconnaissance capability over the area, including the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] and [[Gulf of Tonkin]]. As combat operations from CTF 77 on [[Yankee Station]] into North Vietnamese airspace increased, VQ-2 joined VQ-1 in deploying EA-3Bs to the attack carriers in theater. VQ-2 ceased operations from Da Nang in 1969, but continued to deploy to the aircraft carriers and Cubi Point.\n\nThe squadron suffered three fatal Whale losses between 1966 and 1968:\n# On 3 November 1966, an EA-3B (BUNO 146458)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> disappeared inbound to a recovery on the USS Independence in the central Mediterranean off [[Sicily]]. All six aircrew were lost at sea.\n# On 28 May 1966, an EA-3B Skywarrior (BUNO 142257) of DET ALFA, ran into a typhoon enroute Vietnam. Four of the aircrew bailed out as the three in the cockpit managed to recover the aircraft. The aircraft with the pilot, navigator and crew chief made it back to DET ALFA. The other four perished with only one body recovered and the personal effects of the other three.<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /><ref name=\"StaHypo\" />\n# On 4 June 1968, an EA-3B (BUNO 142670)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" />, flown by the new (by barely beyond a month)squadron CO, CDR T.E. Daum, crashed on takeoff from Rota on a flight to a conference in [[Naples, Italy]]. The Whale lost an engine just after takeoff descended slowly until hitting the ground on the down slope of a hill cartwheeling into a sugar beet field approximately one mile east of the Rota runway. CDR Daum and three of his department heads who were aboard were killed. The crew chief and another petty officer survived. Two squadron junior officers on their way in to the command were the first people to the crash site.<ref name=\"AvSafety\">[https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/158670 Aviation Safety Org Mishap Database]</ref>\n\nThe loss of the USS Liberty during the Six Day War in 1967, reaffirmed the relative safety of using aircraft for fleet reconnaissance. This incident kept the high tempo of operations in the Eastern Mediterranean despite a cesation of strife in Cyprus. As the decade came to a close, VQ-2 found itself operating all over Europe as well as in Southeast Asia.\n\n=== 1970s ===\n[[File:EP-3E Orion of VQ-2 parked c1971.jpg|thumb|EP-3E Aries of VQ-2 parked in 1971]]\nOn 26 February 1970, an EA-3B (BUNO 144851)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> was lost while operating from [[USS Franklin D. Roosevelt (CV-42)|USS ''Franklin D. Roosevelt'']] in the Mediterranean. The [[Aircraft catapult|catapult]] system malfunctioned in mid-stroke, also known as a 'cold cat,\" resulting in the Whale \u201cdribbling\u201d off the bow and being run over by the carrier. Four of the crew members died in the accident<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|title = Cold War Museum|url = http://www.coldwar.org/histories/HistoryofUSNavyFleetAirReconnaissancePartTwo.asp|website = www.coldwar.org|accessdate = 2015-11-08}}</ref>\n\nVQ-2 continued to operate and maintain EC-121M aircraft into 1974. The A3D-1Q was replaced by the A3D-2Q and was subsequently re-designated the EA-3B Skywarrior.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 31 July 1971, the squadron received its first delivery of the [[Lockheed EP-3|EP-3E Aries]] aircraft.<ref name=\":0\" /> This relatively newer airframe gave the squadron a more reliable platform due to its commonality with the VP P-3s and the availability of parts.\n\nIncreasing terrorism related to strife in the Middle East and the increasing Libyan radicalization after the 1969 coup led to a continued high operational tempo. Tensions came to a head with the 1973 Yom Kippur War. This tempo lasted through the decade despite the overall drawdown of the US military after Vietnam.\n\nOn 9 July 1974, the squadron suffered another A-3 loss when its VIP transport-configured A-3, a TA-3B (BUNO 144863)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> crashed at [[Naples International Airport|Capodichino]] in Naples, Italy on approach. All eight aircrew perished in the crash.\n\nThroughout the remainder of the 1970s, the command suffered no aircraft losses. In 1979, the [[Iranian Revolution]] saw an increased US Presence in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. In response, the Navy maintained at least one carrier battle group in the vicinity of the Gulf. VQ-2 shared the manning of carrier and Diego Garcia detachments.<ref>http://www.coldwar.org/histories/HistoryofUSNavyFleetAirReconnaissancePartTwo.asp</ref> This manning would continue until the third phase of the [[Lebanese Civil War]] in 1982.\n\n=== 1980s ===\n[[File:EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on USS Saratoga (CV-60) c1986.jpg|left|thumb|EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS]] Saratoga inn 1986.]]\nAs VQ-2 entered the mid-1980s, the frenzied pace of operations including [[Operation Mole Cricket 19]](Arab-Israel [[Beqaa Valley|Beqaa]] War), and continuing with 1982 - 1983 [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|Beirut Crisis]] with the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing|U.S. Marine barracks bombing]], and the [[United States Sixth Fleet|Sixth Fleet]] December [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|1983 air strike into Lebanon]], allowed little leisure time for the squadron.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nVQ-2 was awarded the [[Navy Expeditionary Medal]] for participation in the Beirut evacuation and operations in the vicinity of [[Libya]] during [[1986 United States bombing of Libya|Operation El Dorado Canyon]], 12\u201317 April 1986.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 25 January 1987, an EA-3B crashed on the USS Nimitz killing all seven crew members.\n\n=== 1990s ===\nIn the summer of 1990, the squadron provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of 2000 non-combatant personnel from war-stricken [[Liberia]] in [[operation Sharp Edge]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Lockheed EP-3E Orion (ARIES), USA - Navy AN2094464.jpg|thumb|EP-3E of VQ-2 based at Rota, Spain, seen arriving for [[Royal International Air Tattoo|RIAT]] '92.]]\nFrom August 1990 to April 1991, VQ-2 provided combat reconnaissance during operations [[Gulf War|Desert Shield/Desert Storm]], Proven Force, and [[Operation Provide Comfort|Provide Comfort]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 29 June 1991, the first EP-3E Aries II aircraft arrived in Rota and on 20 September 1991, the squadron retired the EA-3B Skywarrior the same year.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStarting in July 1992, VQ-2 flew support missions with Operations [[Operation Deny Flight|Deny Flight]], Provide Promise, Sharp Guard, Joint Endeavor, Decisive Endeavor, and Deliberate Guard providing combat reconnaissance and intelligence to [[NATO]] and [[United Nations]] forces in the Former [[Yugoslavia]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs of 1997, VQ-2 operated four EP-3E Aries II aircraft and two [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3C Orion]] aircraft from its home-base at Rota and two-plane detachment at [[Souda Bay|Naval Support Activity Souda Bay, Crete]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn March 1997, VQ-2 provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of non-combatant personnel from [[Albania]] following unrest from a failed [[Pyramid scheme|pyramid savings scheme]] during [[Operation Silver Wake]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== 2000s ===\nVQ-2 relocated from NS Rota, Spain, to NAS Whidbey Island, effective 1 September 2005. The relocation of VQ-2's six aircraft and 450 Sailors to the United States was in keeping with the Navy's ongoing transformation of forces in [[Europe]] and helped reduce costs and eliminate redundancies throughout its force structure worldwide. The move co-located the squadron with [[VQ-1]], already based at NAS Whidbey Island, and realized efficiency through the consolidation of personnel deployment practices, aircraft maintenance practices, and aircrew training for these unique Navy squadrons.<ref>{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Scheduled for Homeport Change|url = http://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=18681|website = www.navy.mil|accessdate = 2015-11-08}}</ref>\n\n=== 2010s ===\nThe squadron was disestablished on 22 May 2012 ending 57 years of service.

Although less well-known than other sites, it is considered significant and has been referred to by archaeologists as \"[[Machu Picchu]] of the North\" and \"The Jewel of La Libertad.\"<ref>[http://www.deperu.com/arqueologia/huamach.html \"Marcahuamachuco\"], Arqueologia, Peru</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Marcahuamachuco- Detalles de muros del Castillo.jpg|thumb|300px|Marcahuamachuco, Muros del Castillo]]\nConstruction of Marcahuamachuco began around AD 400, during the Andean [[Middle Horizon]] period and continued until approximately 800 AD. This was well before the [[Aikan\u00e3|Huari]] and the later imperial expansion of the [[Incas]]. Before being conquered by the Incas in the 14th century, Marcahuamachuco was known as northern Peru's most important political, economic and military center.<ref>[http://www.livinginperu.com/news/14140 \"Marcahuamachuco\"], Living in Peru</ref>\n\nResearchers believed that the site as an oracle center, and for religious and political ceremonies. In the later stages of the culture, it was used as a burial site for the elite. Its influence extended through much of northern Peru and contemporary southern Ecuador. This importance may have been related to trade with its neighbors between AD 650 and 700, the [[Mochica]] to the west, the [[Recuay culture]] to the south, [[Cajamarca]] in the north and lesser-known cultures of the [[Mara\u00f1\u00f3n Province|Maranon]].\n\nBuilt defensively on top of an isolated highland mesa that is 5 kilometers long and 500 meters wide, with a vast view of the surroundings, Marcahuamachuco contains several major compounds. These were surrounded by curved stone walls as high as 12 meters. The remains of inner galleries, rooms and plazas suggest administrative and ceremonial functions. During the later Middle Period (AD 700 - 900) followed into the Intermediate [[Late Horizon]] (until around 1200), archaeological evidence suggests that human burials were made within the walls. These contributed to the ceremonial functions of the site.\n\nMarcahuamachuco probably had oracles, who attracted people from the northern Andes, the areas that today comprise Peru and Ecuador. The cult was probably related to deities, an old cult to [[Ataujo]], and a more recent cult to [[Catequil]]. Marcahuamachuco became a prominent center at the same time that the [[Wari culture|Wari]] in southern Peru culture flourished (AD 400 \u2013 1100). The site was likely abandoned in the 15th century.\n\nThe latest investigations of the site by researchers [[John Topic|John]] and [[Theresa Lange Topic]] (1991) suggested that occupation may have been seasonal, with a maximum population of 6,000. Their estimate is based upon the quantity of arable land and water availability.<ref>Topic, Theresa Lange (1991). \"The Meaning of Monuments at Marcahuamachuco,\" 55th Annual Meeting of the Society for American Archaeology. New Orleans: Abril</ref>\n\n==Investigations==\n[[File:Marcahuamachuco- Sector Las Monjas.jpg|thumb|300px|Marcahuamachuco-(Sector Las Monjas)]]\n\nOne of the earliest sketch maps on Marcahuamachuco comes from the 18th-century document prepared by Bishop [[Baltazar Jaime Martinez Compa\u00f1\u00f3n]]. Early descriptions and drawings from the late 19th century were done by European travelers, as the field of archeology was developing professionally. [[Charles Wiener]] in 1880 published the first topographical description of Marcahuamachuco and named its principal compounds.<ref>Wiener, Charles (1880). ''P\u00e9rou et Bolivie,'' Paris: Librarie Hachette et Cie.</ref> [[Ernst Middendorf]] visited Marcahuamachuco in 1887, describing its principal compounds and comparing the site to [[Kuelap]].<ref>Middendorf, Ernst Wihelm (1893). \"1893Beobachtungen und Studien \u00fcber das Land und seine Bewohner w\u00e4hrend eines 25 J\u00e4hrigen Aufenthalts.\" Berlin</ref><ref>Middendorf, Ernst Wihelm (1895). ''Peru Vol. III, Das Hochland'' Berlin: Robert Oppenheim.</ref>  \n\nThe first formal archaeological research in Marcahuamachuco was conducted during three months in 1900 by [[Max Uhle]] and [[Julio C. Tello]] under the auspices of the [[University of California, Berkeley]] (UC). Uhle photographed the site and corrected the previous maps prepared by Wiener.<ref>Uhle, Max (1900). \"Carta a la Se\u00f1ora Phoebe A. Hearst,\" Universidad de California.</ref> His research was followed in 1941-42 by [[Theodore McCown]] of UC. In addition to reviewing Uhle's writings and collected specimens stored at the University's Museum of Anthropology, during two years of field work he excavated between the monumental galleries. His publication described the site in more detail, and he drew more precise and elaborate maps of the archaeological site, and presented a chronological sequence to explain the cultural development of Marcahuamachuco.<ref>McCown, Theodore D. (1945). ''The Pre-Incaic Site of Huamachuco,'' University of California Publications in American Archaeology and Ethnology, 1945</ref>\n\nIn 1944 archaeologist Hans Horkheimer published photographs from Marcahuamachuco, which showed stone heads similar to those of [[Chav\u00edn culture|Chavin]]. John Thatcher, a student of McCown, continued with research in the site during 1968-69 and 1973\u201374. He worked to establish its cultural phases and chronologies on the basis of ceramic styles.\n\nThe Huamachuco Archaeological Project, supported by a Canadian team, has been dedicated since 1981 to study the prehistory of the area. Its researchers have collected data and drawn conclusions about the site and its history.\n\n==The Site==\nMarcahuamachuco is set atop the nexus of three mountain valleys at an altitude of more than 3,200 meters (10,000 feet). Encompassing more than three kilometres of land, the site is celebrated for its massive castillos and unique circular double-walled archaeological structures. Over many centuries, however, the ruins have been degraded by natural elements, and today face accelerating threats from grazing livestock, plant growth, lack of conservation and surveillance, and the continued effects of natural elements and weather. The site's location, in the northern Peruvian highlands of La Libertad, was until recently a difficult to access place. Today a new road makes it accessible on three and a half hours ride from the city of Trujillo, the third largest on the country's Pacific coast, and location of major Moche heritage sites.\n\nThe domestic residences are multi-storied galleries which originally housed numerous individual families.<ref>Topic, Theresa Lange (1991). \"The Meaning of Monuments at Marcahuamachuco\". 55th Annual Meeting of the Society for American Archaeology. New Orelans: Abril</ref>\n\n==Conservation==\nThe massiveness and monumentality of the Marcahuamachuco complex reveals the importance of its constructions and their function, a factor that has moved the Peruvian Government to support the conservation of this immense archaeological site by recently establishing funding for a major project for conservation of what visitors have denominated \u201cThe Machu Picchu of the North\u201d. More recently the Minister of Culture Juan Ossio denotes the importance of the site and names Marcahuamachuco, [[Wanuku Pampa]] and [[Kuelap]] as the major archaeological tourist destinations, at equal level to [[Machu Picchu]].\n\nIn May 2011, [[Global Heritage Fund]] (GHF) announced that it will provide funding and technical expertise for a conservation at Marcahuamachuco.<ref>http://www.andina.com.pe/Ingles/Noticia.aspx?id=sP/kF71z4hg= {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110601225207/http://www.andina.com.pe/Ingles/Noticia.aspx?id=sP%2FkF71z4hg%3D |date=2011-06-01 }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Archaeological sites in Peru}}\n\n{{coord|7.7853|S|78.0783|W|source:wikidata|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Archaeological sites in Peru]]\n[[Category:Archaeological sites in La Libertad Region]]\n[[Category:Ruins in Peru]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Marcahuamachuco- Plaza Principal (Sector El Castillo).jpg|thumb|300px|Marcahuamachuco- Plaza Principal (Sector El Castillo), [[Huamachuco]]]]\n\n'''Marcahuamachuco''' is an archeological site of [[Pre-Incan]] ruins in the [[La Libertad Region]] of [[Peru]].

Urban''' is a biologist and associate professor in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the [[University of Connecticut]]. His work focuses on the ecological and evolutionary mechanisms that shape natural communities across multiple spatial scales.\n\n{{TOC left}}\n\n==Education==\nMark C. Urban received his B.S. in Environmental Science and Political Science at [[Muhlenberg College]] in 1998 (summa cum laude). He received his M.E.Sc. from the [[Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies]] in 2001 and his Ph.D. in 2006 from [[Yale University]].\n\n==Career==\nUrban was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [[National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis]] (NCEAS) in Santa Barbara, California from 2006\u20132008. In 2008, Urban joined the faculty of the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology department at the [[University of Connecticut]] as Assistant Professor and became Associate Professor in 2014.\n\n==Work==\nMark Urban has contributed to biology by advocating for tighter linkages between ecology and evolutionary biology, suggesting the prevalence of fine-scaled microgeographic adaptation in nature, and highlighting the accelerating [[extinction risk from global warming]].\n\n===Eco-evolutionary dynamics===\nAs a contributor to the subfield of [[Eco-evolution]], he is one of the founders of the ''evolving metacommunity framework'',<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Urban|first1=M. C. and D. K. Skelly|title=Evolving metacommunities: Toward an evolutionary perspective on metacommunities|journal=Ecology|volume=87|issue=7|page=1616|doi=10.1890/0012-9658(2006)87[1616:EMTAEP]2.0.CO;2|year=2006|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/35ad2d817a82a960cd86322011f23bd5820429eb}}</ref> which emphasizes the joint interaction between species-sorting and local adaptation across environmental patches linked by dispersal in determining patterns of diversity across natural landscapes. He has also contributed to the ''community monopolization hypothesis'' which states that evolution alters the assembly and eventual configuration of communities because initial colonists adapt to local conditions and affect the ability of future species to establish.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=De Meester|first1=Luc|title=Evolving perspectives on monopolization and priority effects|journal=Trends in Ecology & Evolution|date=2016|volume=31|issue=2|pages=136\u2013146|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2015.12.009|pmid=26778169}}</ref>\n\n===Microgeographic adaptation===\nHe and his colleagues defined and provided evidence for so-called ''microgeographic adaptation'', the [[adaptation]] of populations at scales finer than expected based on their dispersal ability.<ref name=micro>{{cite journal|last1=Richardson|first1=Jonathan L.|title=Microgeographic adaptation and the spatial scale of evolution|journal=Trends in Ecology & Evolution|volume=29|issue=3|page=165|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2014.01.002|pmid=24560373|year=2014}}</ref> He suggests that adaptation might occur much more often at fine scales because migrants often do poorly outside of their local environment, thus affecting the realized [[gene flow]]. Microgeographic adaptation might therefore often affect local patterns of [[biodiversity]] than commonly expected.\n\n===Climate change biology===\nMark Urban has contributed to our understanding of climate change effects on species and communities. He described the ''biotic multipliers'' of climate change, which are species both sensitive to climate change and with disproportionate effects on communities and ecosystems.<ref name=bioticmultiply>{{cite journal|last1=Zarnetske|first1=Phoebe L.|title=Biotic multipliers of climate change|journal=Science|date=2012|volume=336|issue=6088|pages=1516\u20138|doi=10.1126/science.1222732|pmid=22723403}}</ref> These species are often top predators, and should be the ones to study first because they might have the greatest effects on other species.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Post|first1=Eric|title=Ecology of climate change: the importance of biotic interactions|date=2013|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn=9781400846139|pages=408}}</ref> He also helped develop the ''boxcar effect'', whereby species in cooler regions prevent species in warmer regions from tracking their preferred thermal environment through competition.<ref name=\"climateboxcar\" /> Urban also showed that only evolution might be able to protect all diversity from climate change effects.<ref name=\"evoclimate\" /> He recently found that the [[extinction risk from global warming]] not only increases with warmer temperatures, but actually accelerates.<ref name=\"extinct\" /> His work suggests that if we follow a business-as-usual emissions [[climate change scenario]], then 1 in 6 species could become threatened with extinction from climate change.<ref name=\"extinct\" /><ref name=\"oneinsix\" /><ref name=\"discover\" /> He has suggested that we still know too little about how climate change is affecting nature and need [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/06/opinion/t-shirt-weather-in-the-arctic.html?_r=0 renewed efforts to predict and mediate its effects].<ref name=nyt>{{cite news|last1=Urban|first1=Mark|title=T-shirt weather in the Arctic|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/06/opinion/t-shirt-weather-in-the-arctic.html?_r=0|work=The New York Times|date=5 February 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"forecast\" />\n\n==Selected publications==\nUrban has published over 40 scientific articles (including five in Science, PNAS, and Nature Climate Change).\n*Urban, M.

Urban''' is a biologist and associate professor in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the [[University of Connecticut]]. His work focuses on the ecological and evolutionary mechanisms that shape natural communities across multiple spatial scales.\n\n{{TOC left}}\n\n==Education==\nMark C. Urban received his B.S. in Environmental Science and Political Science at [[Muhlenberg College]] in 1998 (summa cum laude). He received his M.E.Sc. from the [[Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies]] in 2001 and his Ph.D. in 2006 from [[Yale University]].\n\n==Career==\nUrban was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [[National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis]] (NCEAS) in Santa Barbara, California from 2006\u20132008. In 2008, Urban joined the faculty of the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology department at the [[University of Connecticut]] as Assistant Professor and became Associate Professor in 2014.\n\n==Work==\nMark Urban has contributed to biology by advocating for tighter linkages between ecology and evolutionary biology, suggesting the prevalence of fine-scaled microgeographic adaptation in nature, and highlighting the accelerating [[extinction risk from global warming]].\n\n===Eco-evolutionary dynamics===\nAs a contributor to the subfield of [[Eco-evolution]], he is one of the founders of the ''evolving metacommunity framework'',<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Urban|first1=M. C. and D. K. Skelly|title=Evolving metacommunities: Toward an evolutionary perspective on metacommunities|journal=Ecology|volume=87|issue=7|page=1616|doi=10.1890/0012-9658(2006)87[1616:EMTAEP]2.0.CO;2|year=2006|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/35ad2d817a82a960cd86322011f23bd5820429eb}}</ref> which emphasizes the joint interaction between species-sorting and local adaptation across environmental patches linked by dispersal in determining patterns of diversity across natural landscapes. He has also contributed to the ''community monopolization hypothesis'' which states that evolution alters the assembly and eventual configuration of communities because initial colonists adapt to local conditions and affect the ability of future species to establish.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=De Meester|first1=Luc|title=Evolving perspectives on monopolization and priority effects|journal=Trends in Ecology & Evolution|date=2016|volume=31|issue=2|pages=136\u2013146|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2015.12.009|pmid=26778169}}</ref>\n\n===Microgeographic adaptation===\nHe and his colleagues defined and provided evidence for so-called ''microgeographic adaptation'', the [[adaptation]] of populations at scales finer than expected based on their dispersal ability.<ref name=micro>{{cite journal|last1=Richardson|first1=Jonathan L.|title=Microgeographic adaptation and the spatial scale of evolution|journal=Trends in Ecology & Evolution|volume=29|issue=3|page=165|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2014.01.002|pmid=24560373|year=2014}}</ref> He suggests that adaptation might occur much more often at fine scales because migrants often do poorly outside of their local environment, thus affecting the realized [[gene flow]]. Microgeographic adaptation might therefore often affect local patterns of [[biodiversity]] than commonly expected.\n\n===Climate change biology===\nMark Urban has contributed to our understanding of climate change effects on species and communities. He described the ''biotic multipliers'' of climate change, which are species both sensitive to climate change and with disproportionate effects on communities and ecosystems.<ref name=bioticmultiply>{{cite journal|last1=Zarnetske|first1=Phoebe L.|title=Biotic multipliers of climate change|journal=Science|date=2012|volume=336|issue=6088|pages=1516\u20138|doi=10.1126/science.1222732|pmid=22723403}}</ref> These species are often top predators, and should be the ones to study first because they might have the greatest effects on other species.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Post|first1=Eric|title=Ecology of climate change: the importance of biotic interactions|date=2013|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn=9781400846139|pages=408}}</ref> He also helped develop the ''boxcar effect'', whereby species in cooler regions prevent species in warmer regions from tracking their preferred thermal environment through competition.<ref name=\"climateboxcar\" /> Urban also showed that only evolution might be able to protect all diversity from climate change effects.<ref name=\"evoclimate\" /> He recently found that the [[extinction risk from global warming]] not only increases with warmer temperatures, but actually accelerates.<ref name=\"extinct\" /> His work suggests that if we follow a business-as-usual emissions [[climate change scenario]], then 1 in 6 species could become threatened with extinction from climate change.<ref name=\"extinct\" /><ref name=\"oneinsix\" /><ref name=\"discover\" /> He has suggested that we still know too little about how climate change is affecting nature and need [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/06/opinion/t-shirt-weather-in-the-arctic.html?_r=0 renewed efforts to predict and mediate its effects].<ref name=nyt>{{cite news|last1=Urban|first1=Mark|title=T-shirt weather in the Arctic|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/06/opinion/t-shirt-weather-in-the-arctic.html?_r=0|work=The New York Times|date=5 February 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"forecast\" />\n\n==Selected publications==\nUrban has published over 40 scientific articles (including five in Science, PNAS, and Nature Climate Change).\n*Urban, M.

The majority of Somalia's founding fathers hailed from the Hawiye. The first President of Somalia, Prime minister, and the father of the Somali Military were all Hawiye.  [[Aden Adde]] the first president was Udejeen. The first prime minister [[Abdullahi Issa]] was Habar Gidir. The father of Somali military [[Daud Abdulle Hirsi]]  was Abgaal. Since then the Hawiye have produced four more presidents and three more prime ministers. The Hawiye's role in Somalia is not limited to only political affairs. They are also prominent in other important fields in Somali society. The clan also has prominent members within the Somali business and media communities. For example, [[Abdirahman Yabarow]], the editor-in-chief of VOA Somali is also kin. [[Yusuf Garaad Omar]] who was the chairman of BBC Somali for over a decade and helped pioneer its rise during his tenure is also a member. Magool and Hasan Adan Samatar who are among some of the most famous Somali musicians of all time also hail from this clan. The Hawiye also play an important role in business. For instance the head of the Somali airline company Jubba Airways and Hormud Telecom are also members. Currently the Hawiye play a large role primarily in the Somali regions of Galmudug, Hirshabelle, South West State and Banadir (Mogadishu) but also Somalia as a whole.\n\n==History==\nHawiye along with some [[Samaale]] sub-clans migrated to central and southern [[Somalia]] in the 1st century AD to populate the [[Horn of Africa]]. They established farmlands in the fertile plain lands of southern Somalia and also established flourishing harbor ports in south and central Somalia.<ref name=\"Abdurahman2017\">{{cite book|author=Abdullahi, Abdurahman|title=Making Sense of Somali History: Volume 1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X1dDDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA43|date=18 September 2017|publisher=Adonis and Abbey Publishers|isbn=978-1-909112-79-7|pages=43\u2013}}</ref>\n\nThe first written reference to the Hawiye dates back to a 12th-century document by the Arab geographer, [[Ibn Said al-Maghribi|Ibn Sa'id]], who described [[Merca]] at the time as the \"capital of Hawiye country\".

Cassanelli, Towns and Trading centres in Somalia: A Nomadic perspective, Philadelphia, 1980, pp. 8-9.</ref>\n\nLee Cassanelli in his book, ''The Shaping of Somali society'', provides a historical picture of the Hiraab Immate. He writes:\n\n<blockquote>\"According to local oral tradition, the Hiraab imamate was a powerful alliance of closely related groups who shared a common lineage under the Gorgaarte clan divisions. It successfully revolted against the [[Ajuran Empire]] and established an independent rule for at least two centuries from the seventeen hundreds and onwards.<ref name=\"Cassanelli1982\"/>\n\nThe alliance involved the army leaders and advisors of the [[Habar Gidir]] and [[Duduble]], a Fiqhi/Qadi of [[Sheekhaal]], and the Imam was reserved for the [[Mudulood]] branch who is believed to have been the first born. Once established, the Imamate ruled the territories from the Shabeelle valley, the Benaadir provinces, the Mareeg areas all the way to the arid lands of [[Mudug]], whilst the ancient port of [[Hobyo]] emerged as the commercial center and [[Mogadishu]] being its capital for the newly established Hiraab Imamate in the late 17th century.<ref name=\"Cassanelli1982\"/>\n\nHobyo served as a prosperous commercial centre for the Imamate.  The agricultural centres of Eldher and [[Harardhere]] included the production of sorghum and beans, supplementing with herds of camels, cattle, goats and sheep. Livestock, hides and skin, whilst the aromatic woods and raisins were the primary exports as rice, other foodstuffs and clothes were imported. Merchants looking for exotic goods came to Hobyo to buy textiles, precious metals and pearls.  The commercial goods harvested along the [[Shabelle]] river were brought to Hobyo for trade. Also, the increasing importance and rapid settlement of more southernly cities such as [[Mogadishu]] further boosted the prosperity of [[Hobyo]], as more and more ships made their way down the Somali coast and stopped in Hobyo to trade and replenish their supplies.<ref name=\"Cassanelli1982\"/>\n\nThe economy of the Hawiye in the interior includes the predominant nomadic pastoralism, and to some extent, cultivation within agricultural settlements in the riverine area, as well as mercantile commerce along the urban coast. At various points throughout history, trade of modern and ancient commodities by the Hawiye through maritime routes included [[leather|cattle skin]], [[slave]]s, [[ivory]] and [[ambergris]].<ref>Kenya's past; an introduction to historical method in Africa page by Thomas T.

The majority of Somalia's founding fathers hailed from the Hawiye. The first President of Somalia, Prime minister, and the father of the Somali Military were all Hawiye.  [[Aden Adde]] the first president was Udejeen. The first prime minister [[Abdullahi Issa]] was Habar Gidir. The father of Somali military [[Daud Abdulle Hirsi]]  was Abgaal. Since then the Hawiye have produced four more presidents and three more prime ministers. The Hawiye's role in Somalia is not limited to only political affairs. They are also prominent in other important fields in Somali society. The clan also has prominent members within the Somali business and media communities. For example, [[Abdirahman Yabarow]], the editor-in-chief of VOA Somali is also kin. [[Yusuf Garaad Omar]] who was the chairman of BBC Somali for over a decade and helped pioneer its rise during his tenure is also a member. Magool and Hasan Adan Samatar who are among some of the most famous Somali musicians of all time also hail from this clan. The Hawiye also play an important role in business. For instance the head of the Somali airline company Jubba Airways and Hormud Telecom are also members. Currently the Hawiye play a large role primarily in the Somali regions of Galmudug, Hirshabelle, South West State and Banadir (Mogadishu) but also Somalia as a whole.\n\n==History==\nHawiye along with some [[Samaale]] sub-clans migrated to central and southern [[Somalia]] in the 1st century AD to populate the [[Horn of Africa]]. They established farmlands in the fertile plain lands of southern Somalia and also established flourishing harbor ports in south and central Somalia.<ref name=\"Abdurahman2017\">{{cite book|author=Abdullahi, Abdurahman|title=Making Sense of Somali History: Volume 1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X1dDDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA43|date=18 September 2017|publisher=Adonis and Abbey Publishers|isbn=978-1-909112-79-7|pages=43\u2013}}</ref>\n\nThe first written reference to the Hawiye dates back to a 12th-century document by the Arab geographer, [[Ibn Said al-Maghribi|Ibn Sa'id]], who described [[Merca]] at the time as the \"capital of Hawiye country\". The 12th century cartographer [[Muhammad al-Idrisi]] may have referred to the Hawiye as well, as he called Merca the region of the \"Hadiye\", which Herbert S.

Cassanelli, Towns and Trading centres in Somalia: A Nomadic perspective, Philadelphia, 1980, pp. 8-9.</ref>\n\nLee Cassanelli in his book, ''The Shaping of Somali society'', provides a historical picture of the Hiraab Immate. He writes:\n\n<blockquote>\"According to local oral tradition, the Hiraab imamate was a powerful alliance of closely related groups who shared a common lineage under the Gorgaarte clan divisions. It successfully revolted against the [[Ajuran Empire]] and established an independent rule for at least two centuries from the seventeen hundreds and onwards.<ref name=\"Cassanelli1982\"/>\n\nThe alliance involved the army leaders and advisors of the [[Habar Gidir]] and [[Duduble]], a Fiqhi/Qadi of [[Sheekhaal]], and the Imam was reserved for the [[Mudulood]] branch who is believed to have been the first born. Once established, the Imamate ruled the territories from the Shabeelle valley, the Benaadir provinces, the Mareeg areas all the way to the arid lands of [[Mudug]], whilst the ancient port of [[Hobyo]] emerged as the commercial center and [[Mogadishu]] being its capital for the newly established Hiraab Imamate in the late 17th century.<ref name=\"Cassanelli1982\"/>\n\nHobyo served as a prosperous commercial centre for the Imamate.  The agricultural centres of Eldher and [[Harardhere]] included the production of sorghum and beans, supplementing with herds of camels, cattle, goats and sheep. Livestock, hides and skin, whilst the aromatic woods and raisins were the primary exports as rice, other foodstuffs and clothes were imported. Merchants looking for exotic goods came to Hobyo to buy textiles, precious metals and pearls.  The commercial goods harvested along the [[Shabelle]] river were brought to Hobyo for trade. Also, the increasing importance and rapid settlement of more southernly cities such as [[Mogadishu]] further boosted the prosperity of [[Hobyo]], as more and more ships made their way down the Somali coast and stopped in Hobyo to trade and replenish their supplies.<ref name=\"Cassanelli1982\"/>\n\nThe economy of the Hawiye in the interior includes the predominant nomadic pastoralism, and to some extent, cultivation within agricultural settlements in the riverine area, as well as mercantile commerce along the urban coast. At various points throughout history, trade of modern and ancient commodities by the Hawiye through maritime routes included [[leather|cattle skin]], [[slave]]s, [[ivory]] and [[ambergris]].<ref>Kenya's past; an introduction to historical method in Africa page by Thomas T. Spear</ref><ref name=\"Cassanelli1982\"/>\n\nSoon afterwards, the entire region was snapped up by the fascists Italians and it led to the birth of a Modern Somalia.
