Loosely inspired by [[Charles Perrault]]'s [[Sleeping Beauty|original fairy tale]] and [[Walt Disney]]'s 1959 animated film ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]'', the film portrays the story from the perspective of the eponymous antagonist, depicting her conflicted relationship with the princess and king of a corrupt kingdom.<ref>{{cite web |title=Maleficent: Press Kit |url=http://www.wdsmediafile.com/media/maleficent/writen-material/maleficent5375639426893.pdf |publisher=[[The Walt Disney Studios (division)|The Walt Disney Studios]] |accessdate=June 6, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QAUy1jSx?url=http://www.wdsmediafile.com/media/maleficent/writen-material/maleficent5375639426893.pdf |archivedate=June 8, 2014 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>\n\n[[Walt Disney Pictures]] announced the film's development in 2010, with [[Joe Roth]] as producer and Jolie, [[Don Hahn]], and Michael Vieira as executive producers. Principal photography took place between June and October 2012. The film's special screening took place in London on May 9, 2014, at [[Kensington Palace]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.ikonlondonmagazine.com/brad-pitt-and-angelina-jolie-at-the-maleficent-screening-in-kensington-palace/ | title= Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie at the Maleficent Screening | publisher= Ikon London Magazine | date= 10 May 2014 | accessdate= 8 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n''Maleficent'' premiered at the [[El Capitan Theatre]] in Hollywood on May 28, 2014, and was released in the United Kingdom that same day. The film was released in the United States on May 30, 2014 in the [[Disney Digital 3-D|Disney Digital 3D]], [[RealD 3D]], and [[IMAX|IMAX 3D]] formats, as well as in conventional theaters. The film was met with mixed reviews from critics, where it earned praise for its visuals, costumes, musical score, and Jolie's performance, but was criticized for the lack of effort on the screenplay and inconsistent tone. Overall, it was a commercial success, having grossed over $758&nbsp;million worldwide, becoming the [[2014 in film|fourth-highest-grossing film of 2014]] and the highest-grossing film starring Jolie. The film received an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]] at the [[87th Academy Awards]]. A sequel, ''[[Maleficent: Mistress of Evil]]'', was released on October 18, 2019.\n\n==Plot==\nMaleficent is a powerful [[fairy]] living in the Moors, a magical forest realm bordering a human kingdom. As a young girl, Maleficent meets and falls in love with a human [[peasant]] boy named Stefan. On Maleficent's 16th birthday, Stefan said he will be giving her the purest and rarest gift he could give, ''True Love's Kiss,'' but it was not to be. His love is overshadowed by ambition, and as they grow older, the two grow apart and Maleficent becomes protector of the Moors.\n\nWhen King Henry tries to conquer the Moors, Maleficent mortally wounds him, forcing his retreat. As he lies dying, he declares that whoever kills Maleficent will be named his successor and marry his daughter. Stefan visits Maleficent in the Moors, drugs her, but is unable to bring himself to kill Maleficent. Instead, he severs her wings using iron, which is lethal to fairies, and presents them to the king. Devastated by Stefan's betrayal, Maleficent turns the Moors into a dark kingdom and transforms a [[raven]] named Diaval to serve her.\n\nAfter some time, Diaval informs Maleficent that King Stefan's new-born daughter, Aurora is being [[Baptism|christened]]. Vengeful, Maleficent arrives uninvited and curses the infant princess: on her 16th birthday, she will prick her finger on a [[spinning wheel]] [[Spindle (textiles)|spindle]] and fall into a permanent deep sleep. Maleficent mocks Stefan's plea for mercy but offers an antidote; the curse can be broken by true love's kiss, which Maleficent and Stefan believe is nonexistent.\n\nStefan sends Aurora away to live with three pixies \u2014 Knotgrass, Thistlewit, and Flittle \u2014 to protect her until the day after her 16th birthday. He destroys every spinning wheel in the kingdom and hides their remnants in the castle [[dungeon]]. Stefan sends his armies to find and kill Maleficent, but she surrounds the Moors with an impenetrable wall of thorns. In trying to prevent the curse, Stefan slips into madness and paranoia, even neglecting to see his wife on her deathbed.\n\nAs the years pass, Maleficent gradually begins to care for the young Aurora when the bumbling and neglectful pixies fail to properly look after her. After briefly meeting Aurora, Maleficent watches over her from afar. When Aurora is 15, she encounters Maleficent. Aware she is being watched over, Aurora believes Maleficent to be her \"fairy godmother\". Maleficent realizes that she cares for the girl and unsuccessfully attempts to undo the curse, but it is unbreakable other than by true love's kiss. Meanwhile, in the forest, Aurora meets a young prince named Phillip, and the two are attracted to each other.\n\nOn the day before Aurora's 16th birthday, Aurora tells Maleficent that she would like to live with her in the Moors. When Aurora returns to the cottage, the pixies inadvertently tell Aurora of her past and Maleficent's true identity. Aurora runs to her father's castle, upset that Maleficent had never told her about the curse.\n\nTo protect Aurora, Stefan locks her in a room while plotting to kill Maleficent. However, the curse's power draws Aurora to the dungeon. Aurora pricks her finger on a spindle and falls into a deep sleep, fulfilling the curse. Maleficent, intent on saving her, abducts Phillip and infiltrates Stefan's castle. Phillip's kiss fails to awaken Aurora. Finally regretting her past mistakes, Maleficent tearfully apologizes to Aurora and kisses her forehead. Aurora awakens, as Maleficent's motherly feelings for her goddaughter count as true love.\n\nAs Maleficent and Aurora attempt to leave, Stefan and his guards ambush them. An iron net is dropped on Maleficent. Maleficent transforms Diaval into a dragon, who battles Stefan's guards, but he is eventually captured as well. Before Stefan delivers the fatal blow, Aurora finds Maleficent's caged wings and releases them. They fly to Maleficent and reattach themselves. Maleficent carries Stefan to the top of the castle's highest tower but cannot bring herself to kill him. However, Stefan attacks Maleficent as she turns away, and they both plummet from the tower, entwined. Maleficent opens her wings and Stefan loses his grip, falling to his death.\n\nIn the end, Maleficent returns the Moors to its former glory, and Aurora is crowned queen to unite the two kingdoms.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Multiple image\n| align     = \n| direction = horizontal\n| width     = \n| image1    = Angelina Jolie 2 June 2014 (cropped).jpg\n| width1    = 100\n| caption1  =\n| image2    =  Juno Temple at Sundance 2011.jpg\n| width2    = 100\n| caption2  =\n| image3    = Elle_Fanning_2019_by_Glenn_Francis.jpg\n| width3    =  100\n| caption3  =\n| image4    = \nSharltoCopleyCCJuly09.jpg\n| width4    = 100\n| caption4  = \n| image5    = Sam Riley Das finstere Tal Wien 2014 (cropped).jpg\n| width5    = 100\n| caption5  =\n| footer    = [[Angelina Jolie]], [[Juno Temple]], [[Elle Fanning]], [[Sharlto Copley]] and [[Sam Riley]] \n}}\n\n* [[Angelina Jolie]] as [[Maleficent]], a [[fairy]] and the former queen of the Moors.

The novel elaborates on the movie, utilizing a brief prologue detailing [[Maleficent]]'s birth, early childhood and parentage. The movie never fully elaborates on how the intense hatred amongst men and fairfolk during King Henry's reign came to be, a void the novel fills. The novel also features some different versions of key moments in the film, for example, [[List of Disney's Sleeping Beauty characters#King Stefan|Stefan]] angrily smothers King Henry on his deathbed after he declares that he's still unfit to rule even after having brought Maleficent's severed wings to him. Later, Stefan forges a Royal Proclamation declaring himself as the late monarch's chosen successor. Maleficent's encounter with the infant [[Aurora (Disney character)|Princess Aurora]] in the forest also differs from the one in the film, since Aurora does feel afraid of Maleficent after she frightens her away. Some of these ideas had originally been filmed but were either cut or altered during post-production while others may have been dramatic license on the part of the author.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n===Home media===\n''Maleficent'' was released by [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment]] on [[Blu-ray]], DVD, Blu-ray 3D and digital download on November 4, 2014.<ref>{{cite web| title=Maleficent DVD & Blu-ray| url=http://videoeta.com/movie/138036/maleficent| publisher=VideoETA| accessdate=July 25, 2014| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728041133/http://videoeta.com/movie/138036/maleficent/| archive-date=July 28, 2014| url-status=dead}}</ref> The film topped the home video sales chart in its first week of release.<ref>{{cite web|title='Maleficent' Captures Top Spot on Home Video Sales Charts, Unseats 'X-Men'| url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/maleficent-tops-home-video-sales-hercules-1201355592/| newspaper=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]| accessdate=June 12, 2015}}</ref> As of February 2015, ''Maleficent'' has made over $74&nbsp;million in total home video sales.<ref>{{cite news| title=Maleficent| url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Maleficent#tab=video-sales| accessdate=12 June 2015| newspaper=The Numbers|date=9 November 2014}}</ref> ''Maleficent'' was released  on [[Ultra HD Blu-ray|4K UHD Blu-ray]] on  September 24, 2019.<ref>{{Citation|title=Maleficent 4K Blu-ray|url=https://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Maleficent-4K-Blu-ray/247739/|access-date=2019-08-18}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\n''Maleficent'' earned a gross of $241.4&nbsp;million in the USA & Canada, and $517.1&nbsp;million in other countries, for a worldwide total of $758.5&nbsp;million against a budget of $180&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"bom\"/> Calculating in all expenses, ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'' estimated that the film made a profit of $190.77&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2015/03/maleficent-profit-box-office-2014-1201391209/| title=No. 6 \u2018Maleficent\u2019 \u2013 2014 Most Valuable Blockbuster Movie Tournament| first=Mike| last=Fleming Jr.| journal=[[Deadline Hollywood]]| date=March 12, 2015| accessdate=March 13, 2015}}</ref> Worldwide, in its opening weekend, the film earned $175.5&nbsp;million,<ref name=\"weekend\"/><ref name=\"Ddln-OS-opng\" /> $9&nbsp;million of which was from [[IMAX]] locations.<ref name=\"BOJune1\">{{cite news| title=GLOBAL: 'Maleficent' Edges Out X-Men for Box Office Crown with $100.6M Day-and-Date Debut Overseas |url=http://www.boxoffice.com/news/2014-06-01-global-maleficent-edges-out-x-men-for-box-office-crown-with-1006m-day-and-date-debut-overseas |accessdate=June 2, 2014 |work=[[Boxoffice (magazine)|Boxoffice]] |date=June 1, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140602200240/http://www.boxoffice.com/news/2014-06-01-global-maleficent-edges-out-x-men-for-box-office-crown-with-1006m-day-and-date-debut-overseas |archivedate=June 2, 2014 |df= }}</ref> It is also the biggest debut among films starring Angelina Jolie,<ref name=\"BOJune1\" /> and the actress' highest-grossing film of all time worldwide,<ref name=\"4thwkoverseas\">{{cite news|title=GLOBAL: Strong Brazil Bow Sends 'How to Train Your Dragon 2' to $43.5 Million Overseas Weekend;

Hayley Krischner of ''[[HuffPost|The Huffington Post]]'' interpreted the scene as an important reference to [[rape culture]]: \"This is the horrific side of rape culture. We're so enmeshed in it that it's impossible to ignore a metaphoric rape that occurs in a Disney movie\". She went on to praise the film for giving a positive and hopeful message to rape victims, ultimately allowing \"the woman to recover. It gives her agency. It gives her power. It allows her to reclaim the story\".<ref>{{cite news| last1=Krischer| first1=Hayley| title=The Maleficent Rape Scene That We Need to Talk About| url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/hayley-krischer/the-maleficent-rape-scene_b_5445974.html?ncid=fcbklnkushpmg00000046| accessdate=June 10, 2014| newspaper=HuffPost| date=June 6, 2014}}</ref> Monika Bartyzel of ''[[The Weekly Standard|The Week]]'' noted the scene's implications in her review: \"In its first act, ''Maleficent'' offers a dark, surprisingly adult exploration of rape and female [[mutilation]]\".\n\nHowever, Bartyzel went on to opine that the film portrayed Maleficent's actions as \"a [[Rape and revenge film|rape revenge fantasy]]\" and criticized the film for not following through on its early subtext, ultimately calling it less feminist and reductive compared to its 1959 counterpart: \"In ''Maleficent'', Aurora is the product of a cold and loveless marriage and a vengeful, unhinged rapist. Her safety relies on a trio of clueless and dangerously careless fairies, and her Godmother is the woman who cursed her\u2014and who had, in turn, been violated by her own father\".<ref>{{cite news| last1=Bartyzel| first1=Monika| title=Girls on Film: Maleficent is less progressive than 1959's Sleeping Beauty| url=https://theweek.com/article/index/262679/girls-on-film-maleficent-is-less-progressive-than-1959s-sleeping-beauty#axzz34ATYF2dp| accessdate=June 10, 2014| date=June 6, 2014}}</ref>\n\nAngelina Jolie addressed the issue during an interview with BBC Radio 4 on the ''[[Woman's Hour]]'' programme and claimed that the subtext was intentional: \"The question was asked: 'What could make a woman become so dark and lose all sense of her maternity, her womanhood, and her softness?' ... We were very conscious, the writer and I, that [the scene] was a metaphor for rape\". She further explained that the answer to the question \"What could bring her back?\" was still \"an extreme ''Disney'', fun version [of the story]\", but \"at the core it is abuse, and how the abused then have a choice of abusing others or overcoming and remaining loving, open people\".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Bahadur| first1=Nina| title=Angelina Jolie: 'Maleficent' Scene Is A 'Metaphor For Rape'| url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/11/angelina-jolie-maleficent-rape-scene_n_5485633.html| accessdate=June 20, 2014| work=HuffPost| date=June 11, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| last1=Holmes| first1=Sally| title=Angelina Jolie Says Violent Maleficent Scene Was a Metaphor for Rape|url=http://www.elle.com/news/culture/angelina-jolie-maleficent-scene-metaphor-for-rape|accessdate=June 20, 2014| work=[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]| date=June 12, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Capitalism and socialism===\nJordan Shapiro of ''[[Forbes]]'' argued that the film's main subtext was the detrimental effects of ultimatums between [[Capitalism|capitalist]] and [[Socialism|socialist]] societies. He pointed out that the Moors represented a socialist, nature-oriented, democratic society while the human kingdom was one of capitalism, industry and [[absolute monarchy]]. Shapiro further commented that the character of Stefan, his theft of the Moors' riches (the jewel) and his mutilation of Maleficent's wings for the sake of his ambition were references to the [[American Dream]].\n\nHe conceived the wing-tearing scene as \"a social commentary that any hierarchical rise to power inherently happens through the exploitation of others\", explaining that it was the reason why \"without her wings, Maleficent also becomes an oppressive ruler of the Moors. Everything she represents, believes and stands for has been grounded\", and \"like most victims of oppression\", \"she takes it out on those who are smaller and weaker\". He concluded that through the merge of the two kingdoms at the end of the film, it sought to weave together capitalism and socialism and let go oppositions: \"It is time to leave the kingdom of familiar partisan oppositions: let's replace ''either/or'' with ''neither/nor'' or ''both/and''\".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Shapiro|first1=Jordan|title=Why Disney's 'Maleficent'

The film was met with mixed reviews from critics, where it earned praise for its visuals, costumes, musical score, and Jolie's performance, but was criticized for the lack of effort on the screenplay and inconsistent tone. Overall, it was a commercial success, having grossed over $758&nbsp;million worldwide, becoming the [[2014 in film|fourth-highest-grossing film of 2014]] and the highest-grossing film starring Jolie. The film received an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]] at the [[87th Academy Awards]]. A sequel, ''[[Maleficent: Mistress of Evil]]'', was released on October 18, 2019.\n\n==Plot==\nMaleficent is a powerful [[fairy]] living in the Moors, a magical forest realm bordering a human kingdom. As a young girl, Maleficent meets and falls in love with a human [[peasant]] boy named Stefan. On Maleficent's 16th birthday, Stefan said he will be giving her the purest and rarest gift he could give, ''True Love's Kiss,'' but it was not to be. His love is overshadowed by ambition, and as they grow older, the two grow apart and Maleficent becomes protector of the Moors.\n\nWhen King Henry tries to conquer the Moors, Maleficent mortally wounds him, forcing his retreat. As he lies dying, he declares that whoever kills Maleficent will be named his successor and marry his daughter. Stefan visits Maleficent in the Moors, drugs her, but is unable to bring himself to kill Maleficent. Instead, he severs her wings using iron, which is lethal to fairies, and presents them to the king. Devastated by Stefan's betrayal, Maleficent turns the Moors into a dark kingdom and transforms a [[raven]] named Diaval to serve her.\n\nAfter some time, Diaval informs Maleficent that King Stefan's new-born daughter, Aurora is being [[Baptism|christened]]. Vengeful, Maleficent arrives uninvited and curses the infant princess: on her 16th birthday, she will prick her finger on a [[spinning wheel]] [[Spindle (textiles)|spindle]] and fall into a permanent deep sleep. Maleficent mocks Stefan's plea for mercy but offers an antidote; the curse can be broken by true love's kiss, which Maleficent and Stefan believe is nonexistent.\n\nStefan sends Aurora away to live with three pixies \u2014 Knotgrass, Thistlewit, and Flittle \u2014 to protect her until the day after her 16th birthday. He destroys every spinning wheel in the kingdom and hides their remnants in the castle [[dungeon]]. Stefan sends his armies to find and kill Maleficent, but she surrounds the Moors with an impenetrable wall of thorns. In trying to prevent the curse, Stefan slips into madness and paranoia, even neglecting to see his wife on her deathbed.\n\nAs the years pass, Maleficent gradually begins to care for the young Aurora when the bumbling and neglectful pixies fail to properly look after her. After briefly meeting Aurora, Maleficent watches over her from afar. When Aurora is 15, she encounters Maleficent. Aware she is being watched over, Aurora believes Maleficent to be her \"fairy godmother\". Maleficent realizes that she cares for the girl and unsuccessfully attempts to undo the curse, but it is unbreakable other than by true love's kiss. Meanwhile, in the forest, Aurora meets a young prince named Phillip, and the two are attracted to each other.\n\nOn the day before Aurora's 16th birthday, Aurora tells Maleficent that she would like to live with her in the Moors. When Aurora returns to the cottage, the pixies inadvertently tell Aurora of her past and Maleficent's true identity. Aurora runs to her father's castle, upset that Maleficent had never told her about the curse.\n\nTo protect Aurora, Stefan locks her in a room while plotting to kill Maleficent. However, the curse's power draws Aurora to the dungeon. Aurora pricks her finger on a spindle and falls into a deep sleep, fulfilling the curse. Maleficent, intent on saving her, abducts Phillip and infiltrates Stefan's castle. Phillip's kiss fails to awaken Aurora. Finally regretting her past mistakes, Maleficent tearfully apologizes to Aurora and kisses her forehead. Aurora awakens, as Maleficent's motherly feelings for her goddaughter count as true love.\n\nAs Maleficent and Aurora attempt to leave, Stefan and his guards ambush them. An iron net is dropped on Maleficent. Maleficent transforms Diaval into a dragon, who battles Stefan's guards, but he is eventually captured as well. Before Stefan delivers the fatal blow, Aurora finds Maleficent's caged wings and releases them. They fly to Maleficent and reattach themselves. Maleficent carries Stefan to the top of the castle's highest tower but cannot bring herself to kill him. However, Stefan attacks Maleficent as she turns away, and they both plummet from the tower, entwined. Maleficent opens her wings and Stefan loses his grip, falling to his death.\n\nIn the end, Maleficent returns the Moors to its former glory, and Aurora is crowned queen to unite the two kingdoms.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Multiple image\n| align     = \n| direction = horizontal\n| width     = \n| image1    = Angelina Jolie 2 June 2014 (cropped).jpg\n| width1    = 100\n| caption1  =\n| image2    =  Juno Temple at Sundance 2011.jpg\n| width2    = 100\n| caption2  =\n| image3    = Elle_Fanning_2019_by_Glenn_Francis.jpg\n| width3    =  100\n| caption3  =\n| image4    = \nSharltoCopleyCCJuly09.jpg\n| width4    = 100\n| caption4  = \n| image5    = Sam Riley Das finstere Tal Wien 2014 (cropped).jpg\n| width5    = 100\n| caption5  =\n| footer    = [[Angelina Jolie]], [[Juno Temple]], [[Elle Fanning]], [[Sharlto Copley]] and [[Sam Riley]] \n}}\n\n* [[Angelina Jolie]] as [[Maleficent]], a [[fairy]] and the former queen of the Moors.

She also remarked on how she scared little girls when she was in costume, makeup, and acting during shooting; this led to the decision of hiring her own daughter, Vivienne Jolie-Pitt, for the role of the young Princess Aurora, since she would not be scared of her own mother during principal photography.<ref>{{Ch\u00fa th\u00edch web |url = https://www.vanityfair.com/vf-hollywood/maleficent-angelina-jolie-vivienne-jolie-pitt?mbid=social_twitter |work = Vanity Fair |title = Vivienne Jolie-Pitt Scored Maleficent Role Because All Other Children Were Terrified of Angelina Jolie|accessdate=March 20, 2014|author = Josh Duboff |date=March 5, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=McIntyre|first=Gina|title=Angelina Jolie arrives in Anaheim to unveil 'Maleficent' at D23|url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/movies/angelina-jolie-arrives-in-anaheim-to-unveil-maleficent-at-d23/#/0|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=November 12, 2013|date=August 10, 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[Walt Disney Pictures]] released the teaser poster for ''Maleficent'' on November 12, 2013, featuring Jolie in costume and makeup, akin to the character's depiction in [[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|the original film]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2013/11/12/angelina-jolie-malificent-poster| title=Angelina Jolie is magnificent as Maleficent| work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]| date=November 12, 2013| accessdate=November 12, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Lewis|first=Hilary|title=Angelina Jolie Bewitches in First 'Maleficent' Poster|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/first-maleficent-poster-angelina-jolie-655276|accessdate=January 27, 2014|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|date=November 12, 2014}}</ref> The first trailer was released the following day, on November 13.

The novel elaborates on the movie, utilizing a brief prologue detailing [[Maleficent]]'s birth, early childhood and parentage. The movie never fully elaborates on how the intense hatred amongst men and fairfolk during King Henry's reign came to be, a void the novel fills. The novel also features some different versions of key moments in the film, for example, [[List of Disney's Sleeping Beauty characters#King Stefan|Stefan]] angrily smothers King Henry on his deathbed after he declares that he's still unfit to rule even after having brought Maleficent's severed wings to him. Later, Stefan forges a Royal Proclamation declaring himself as the late monarch's chosen successor. Maleficent's encounter with the infant [[Aurora (Disney character)|Princess Aurora]] in the forest also differs from the one in the film, since Aurora does feel afraid of Maleficent after she frightens her away. Some of these ideas had originally been filmed but were either cut or altered during post-production while others may have been dramatic license on the part of the author.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n===Home media===\n''Maleficent'' was released by [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment]] on [[Blu-ray]], DVD, Blu-ray 3D and digital download on November 4, 2014.<ref>{{cite web| title=Maleficent DVD & Blu-ray| url=http://videoeta.com/movie/138036/maleficent| publisher=VideoETA| accessdate=July 25, 2014| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728041133/http://videoeta.com/movie/138036/maleficent/| archive-date=July 28, 2014| url-status=dead}}</ref> The film topped the home video sales chart in its first week of release.<ref>{{cite web|title='Maleficent' Captures Top Spot on Home Video Sales Charts, Unseats 'X-Men'| url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/maleficent-tops-home-video-sales-hercules-1201355592/| newspaper=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]| accessdate=June 12, 2015}}</ref> As of February 2015, ''Maleficent'' has made over $74&nbsp;million in total home video sales.<ref>{{cite news| title=Maleficent| url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Maleficent#tab=video-sales| accessdate=12 June 2015| newspaper=The Numbers|date=9 November 2014}}</ref> ''Maleficent'' was released  on [[Ultra HD Blu-ray|4K UHD Blu-ray]] on  September 24, 2019.<ref>{{Citation|title=Maleficent 4K Blu-ray|url=https://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Maleficent-4K-Blu-ray/247739/|access-date=2019-08-18}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\n''Maleficent'' earned a gross of $241.4&nbsp;million in the USA & Canada, and $517.1&nbsp;million in other countries, for a worldwide total of $758.5&nbsp;million against a budget of $180&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"bom\"/> Calculating in all expenses, ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'' estimated that the film made a profit of $190.77&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2015/03/maleficent-profit-box-office-2014-1201391209/| title=No. 6 \u2018Maleficent\u2019 \u2013 2014 Most Valuable Blockbuster Movie Tournament| first=Mike| last=Fleming Jr.| journal=[[Deadline Hollywood]]| date=March 12, 2015| accessdate=March 13, 2015}}</ref> Worldwide, in its opening weekend, the film earned $175.5&nbsp;million,<ref name=\"weekend\"/><ref name=\"Ddln-OS-opng\" /> $9&nbsp;million of which was from [[IMAX]] locations.<ref name=\"BOJune1\">{{cite news| title=GLOBAL: 'Maleficent' Edges Out X-Men for Box Office Crown with $100.6M Day-and-Date Debut Overseas |url=http://www.boxoffice.com/news/2014-06-01-global-maleficent-edges-out-x-men-for-box-office-crown-with-1006m-day-and-date-debut-overseas |accessdate=June 2, 2014 |work=[[Boxoffice (magazine)|Boxoffice]] |date=June 1, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140602200240/http://www.boxoffice.com/news/2014-06-01-global-maleficent-edges-out-x-men-for-box-office-crown-with-1006m-day-and-date-debut-overseas |archivedate=June 2, 2014 |df= }}</ref> It is also the biggest debut among films starring Angelina Jolie,<ref name=\"BOJune1\" /> and the actress' highest-grossing film of all time worldwide,<ref name=\"4thwkoverseas\">{{cite news|title=GLOBAL: Strong Brazil Bow Sends 'How to Train Your Dragon 2' to $43.5 Million Overseas Weekend;

Hayley Krischner of ''[[HuffPost|The Huffington Post]]'' interpreted the scene as an important reference to [[rape culture]]: \"This is the horrific side of rape culture. We're so enmeshed in it that it's impossible to ignore a metaphoric rape that occurs in a Disney movie\". She went on to praise the film for giving a positive and hopeful message to rape victims, ultimately allowing \"the woman to recover. It gives her agency. It gives her power. It allows her to reclaim the story\".<ref>{{cite news| last1=Krischer| first1=Hayley| title=The Maleficent Rape Scene That We Need to Talk About| url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/hayley-krischer/the-maleficent-rape-scene_b_5445974.html?ncid=fcbklnkushpmg00000046| accessdate=June 10, 2014| newspaper=HuffPost| date=June 6, 2014}}</ref> Monika Bartyzel of ''[[The Weekly Standard|The Week]]'' noted the scene's implications in her review: \"In its first act, ''Maleficent'' offers a dark, surprisingly adult exploration of rape and female [[mutilation]]\".\n\nHowever, Bartyzel went on to opine that the film portrayed Maleficent's actions as \"a [[Rape and revenge film|rape revenge fantasy]]\" and criticized the film for not following through on its early subtext, ultimately calling it less feminist and reductive compared to its 1959 counterpart: \"In ''Maleficent'', Aurora is the product of a cold and loveless marriage and a vengeful, unhinged rapist. Her safety relies on a trio of clueless and dangerously careless fairies, and her Godmother is the woman who cursed her\u2014and who had, in turn, been violated by her own father\".<ref>{{cite news| last1=Bartyzel| first1=Monika| title=Girls on Film: Maleficent is less progressive than 1959's Sleeping Beauty| url=https://theweek.com/article/index/262679/girls-on-film-maleficent-is-less-progressive-than-1959s-sleeping-beauty#axzz34ATYF2dp| accessdate=June 10, 2014| date=June 6, 2014}}</ref>\n\nAngelina Jolie addressed the issue during an interview with BBC Radio 4 on the ''[[Woman's Hour]]'' programme and claimed that the subtext was intentional: \"The question was asked: 'What could make a woman become so dark and lose all sense of her maternity, her womanhood, and her softness?' ... We were very conscious, the writer and I, that [the scene] was a metaphor for rape\". She further explained that the answer to the question \"What could bring her back?\" was still \"an extreme ''Disney'', fun version [of the story]\", but \"at the core it is abuse, and how the abused then have a choice of abusing others or overcoming and remaining loving, open people\".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Bahadur| first1=Nina| title=Angelina Jolie: 'Maleficent' Scene Is A 'Metaphor For Rape'| url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/11/angelina-jolie-maleficent-rape-scene_n_5485633.html| accessdate=June 20, 2014| work=HuffPost| date=June 11, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| last1=Holmes| first1=Sally| title=Angelina Jolie Says Violent Maleficent Scene Was a Metaphor for Rape|url=http://www.elle.com/news/culture/angelina-jolie-maleficent-scene-metaphor-for-rape|accessdate=June 20, 2014| work=[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]| date=June 12, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Capitalism and socialism===\nJordan Shapiro of ''[[Forbes]]'' argued that the film's main subtext was the detrimental effects of ultimatums between [[Capitalism|capitalist]] and [[Socialism|socialist]] societies. He pointed out that the Moors represented a socialist, nature-oriented, democratic society while the human kingdom was one of capitalism, industry and [[absolute monarchy]]. Shapiro further commented that the character of Stefan, his theft of the Moors' riches (the jewel) and his mutilation of Maleficent's wings for the sake of his ambition were references to the [[American Dream]].\n\nHe conceived the wing-tearing scene as \"a social commentary that any hierarchical rise to power inherently happens through the exploitation of others\", explaining that it was the reason why \"without her wings, Maleficent also becomes an oppressive ruler of the Moors. Everything she represents, believes and stands for has been grounded\", and \"like most victims of oppression\", \"she takes it out on those who are smaller and weaker\". He concluded that through the merge of the two kingdoms at the end of the film, it sought to weave together capitalism and socialism and let go oppositions: \"It is time to leave the kingdom of familiar partisan oppositions: let's replace ''either/or'' with ''neither/nor'' or ''both/and''\".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Shapiro|first1=Jordan|title=Why Disney's 'Maleficent'
