Another possible mode of introduction is on anchors and chains, although this has not been proven. Since adult zebra mussels can survive out of water for several days or weeks if the temperature is low and humidity is high, chain lockers provide temporary refuge for clusters of adult mussels that could easily be released when transoceanic ships drop anchor in freshwater ports. They have become an invasive species in North America, and as such they are the target of federal policy to control them, for instance in the [[National Invasive Species Act (1996)#Zebra mussels|National Invasive Species Act (1996)]].\n\nUsing models based on the genetic algorithm for rule-set production (GARP), a group of researchers predicted that the [[southeastern United States]] is moderately to highly likely to be inhabited by zebra mussels and the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] unlikely to experience a zebra mussel invasion of water bodies.<ref>Drake, John M., and Jonathan M.

Trailered boat traffic is the most likely vector for invasion into [[Western Cordillera (North America)|Western North America]]. This spread is preventable if boaters thoroughly clean and dry their boats and associated equipment before transporting them to new bodies of water. Since no North American predator or combination of predators has been shown to significantly reduce zebra mussel numbers, such spread would most likely result in permanent establishment of zebra mussels in many North American [[waterway]]s.\n\nA major decrease in the concentration of dissolved oxygen was observed in the Seneca River in central New York in the summer of 1993. This decrease was caused by extremely high concentrations of zebra mussels in the watershed. Additionally, the Seneca River had significantly less chlorophyll in the water, which is used as a measure of phytoplankton biomass, because of the presence of zebra mussels.<ref>Effler, Steven W., Carol M.

Another possible mode of introduction is on anchors and chains, although this has not been proven. Since adult zebra mussels can survive out of water for several days or weeks if the temperature is low and humidity is high, chain lockers provide temporary refuge for clusters of adult mussels that could easily be released when transoceanic ships drop anchor in freshwater ports.

This spread is preventable if boaters thoroughly clean and dry their boats and associated equipment before transporting them to new bodies of water.

{"title_page": "The Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health", "text_new": "The '''Foundation for Integrated Health''' (FIH) was a controversial charity run by [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], founded in 1993. The Foundation promoted [[alternative medicine|complementary and alternative medicine]], preferring to use the term \"[[integrative medicine|integrated health]]\", and lobbied for its inclusion in the [[National Health Service]]. The charity closed in 2010 after allegations of fraud and money laundering led to the arrest of a former official.\n\n==History==\nPrince Charles established the charity in 1993 to explore \"how safe, proven complementary therapies can work in conjunction with mainstream medicine\".<ref name=Booth>{{cite news| title=Prince Charles's aide at homeopathy charity arrested on suspicion of fraud | author=Robert Booth | publisher=guardian.co.uk |date=26 April 2010| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/apr/26/prince-charles-aide-homeopathy-charity-arrested | location=London}}</ref>\n\n[[Michael Dixon (doctor)|Dr Michael Dixon]] was appointed the Foundation's medical director. From 2005 to 2007, FIH received a grant from the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] to help organise the self-regulation of complementary therapies. There had been concern that with a large proportion of the public turning to complementary approaches, there were few safeguards in place to ensure that non-statutorily regulated therapists were safe, trained and would act in an appropriate way. FIH worked to bring together the representative bodies of many complementary professions to talk and agree standards.<ref>[http://www.fih.org.uk/what_we_do/regulation/index.html Regulating complementary therapies - Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The result was the formation of the [[Complementary and Natural Healthcare Council]] (CNHC) which had hoped to register 10,000 practitioners of complementary medicine by the end of 2009 but which by September 2009 had succeeded in enrolling less than a tenth of that number due to lack of interest on the part of some of their professional associations. The Department of Health is currently continuing to fund the CNHC but future funding will be dependent on substantial progress being made towards the target (which has now been reduced to 2,000).

From 2005 to 2007, FIH received a grant from the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] to help organise the self-regulation of complementary therapies. There had been concern that with a large proportion of the public turning to complementary approaches, there were few safeguards in place to ensure that non-statutorily regulated therapists were safe, trained and would act in an appropriate way.

The Department of Health is currently continuing to fund the CNHC but future funding will be dependent on substantial progress being made towards the target (which has now been reduced to 2,000).
