The SB functioned as the chief secret service until the [[fall of communism in Poland]] in 1989 and was disbanded in 1990.

The Ministry of Public Security structure was being changed constantly from January 1945 on, as the Ministry expanded. It was divided into departments and each department was subdivided into sections entrusted with different tasks. In January 1945, the largest and the most important department in UB was Department One, responsible for ''counter-espionage'' and ''anti-state activities''. It was headed by General [[Roman Romkowski]]. ''Department I'' was divided into Sections, each responsible for a different but specific function ''self-described'' in the following way:\n# Fighting German espionage and Nazi underground remaining in Poland.\n# Fighting reactionary underground.\n# Fighting political banditry.\n# Protection of the national economy.\n# Protection of legal political parties from outside (underground) penetration.\n# Prisons.\n# Observation.\n# Investigations.\n\nTwo new departments were formed in addition to departments and sections created for the Resort Bezpiecze\u0144stwa Publicznego (RBP) forming the core of '''MBP''' or UB in January 1945. On September 6, 1945, from the existing structure of ''Department II'' emerged three additional departments: ''Department IV'' commanded by Aleksander Wolski-Dyszko, ''Department V'' commanded by [[Julia Brystygier]], and ''Department VI'' headed by [[Teodor Duda]] ''[[:pl:Teodor Duda|(pl)]]''. In July 1946, further changes were enacted. UB was divided into eight (8) departments, five of which dealt with operational cases, including ''Counter-espionage'' (Dep 1), ''Technical operations and technology'' (Dep 2), ''Fighting underground resistance'' (Dep 3), ''Protection of economy'' (Dep 4), and ''Counteraction of hostile penetration and church influences'' (Dep 5).<ref name=\"ipn.gov.pl-1\" />\n\nIn June 1948 the ''Secret Office'' was established for ''Internal'' counter-intelligence. The Special Office conducted surveillance on members of the MPB itself. On March 2, 1949, the ''Special Bureau'' was established, renamed in 1951 simply as ''Department Ten''. Department 10 conducted surveillance of high-ranking members of the [[Polish United Workers' Party]] and people associated with them.<ref name=\"ipn.gov.pl-1\" />\n\n=== Ministry of Public Security roster (1951 and 1953) ===\n[[File:Organization of the Ministerstwo Bezpieczenstwa Publicznego 1953.png|thumb|300px|Ministry of Public Security organization for 1953, (Organizacja Ministerstwa Bezpiecze\u0144stwa Publicznego na rok 1953, M Malinowski)]]\n<small>\n;[[Minister (government)|Minister]] of Public Security \u2013 Gen.

Each WUBP had 308 full-time UB officers and employees on staff.

The Red Army provided assistance to MPB not only in the form of advisors, but also with their own paramilitary units including [[NKGB]], [[NKVD]], [[GRU]], [[SMERSH]]; and, in later years [[Ministry for State Security (Soviet Union)|MGB]], [[MVD]] and [[KGB]].<ref name=\"ipn.gov.pl-1\" />\n\nThe first Russian chief advisor to the MPB was [[Major General]] [[Ivan Serov]], a well-trained Stalinist experienced with Soviet security organs.

In 1941\u20131945, he was the First Deputy People's Commissar of the State Security and later \u2013 Deputy People's Commissar of Internal Affairs of the Soviet Union. Once he became main advisor to the UB in March 1945, Ivan Serov oversaw the kidnapping of 16 top Polish politicians and underground resistance leaders, secretly transported them to [[Moscow]], where they were tortured and thrown into jail after the staged [[Trial of the Sixteen]].

On December 5, 1953, the day after meeting Mielke, \u015awiat\u0142o defected to the United States through their military mission in [[West Berlin]]. The next day, American military authorities transported \u015awiat\u0142o to [[Frankfurt]] and by December, \u015awiat\u0142o had been flown to Washington D.C, where he underwent an extensive debriefing.<ref name=\"ipn.gov.pl-1\" />\n\n[[File:Swiatlo.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[J\u00f3zef \u015awiat\u0142o]], born Izaak Fleischfarb, defected to the West and spoke publicly of UB's brutal actions]]\n\n\u015awiat\u0142o's defection was widely publicized in the United States and Europe by the American authorities, as well as in Poland via [[Radio Free Europe]], embarrassing the authorities in Warsaw. \u015awiat\u0142o had intimate knowledge of the internal politics of the Polish government, especially the activities of the various secret services. Over the course of the following months, American newspapers and Radio Free Europe reported extensively on political repression in Poland based on \u015awiat\u0142o revelations, including the [[torture]] of prisoners under interrogation and politically motivated executions. \u015awiat\u0142o also detailed struggles inside the [[Polish United Workers' Party]].<ref name=\"ipn.gov.pl-1\" />\n\nAmong other activities, \u015awiat\u0142o had been ordered to falsify evidence that was used to incriminate [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka]], whom he personally arrested. He had also arrested and falsified evidence against [[Marian Spychalski]], the future [[Minister of National Defence (Poland)|Minister of National Defence]], who was at the time a leading politician and high-ranking military officer.\n\n== 1954 reorganization and formation of SB ==\nThe highly publicized defection of Colonel \u015awiat\u0142o, not to mention the general hatred of the Ministry of Public Security among the Polish public led to changes in late 1954. In December of that year, the [[Polish Council of State]] and the [[Council of Ministers of Poland|Council of Ministers]] decided to replace the ministry with two separate administrations: the [[Committee for Public Security]] (''Komitet do Spraw Bezpiecze\u0144stwa Publicznego'' or KDSBP), headed by [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Dworakowski]], and the Ministry of Interior (''Ministerstwo Spraw Wewn\u0119trznych'' or MSW), headed by [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Wicha]]. The number of employees of the Committee for Public Security was cut by 30% in central headquarters and by 40\u201350% in local structures. The huge network of secret informers was also substantially reduced and the most implicated functionaries of the Ministry of Public Security were arrested. Surveillance and repressive activities were reduced; in the majority of factories, special cells of public security, set up to spy on workers, were secretly closed.<ref name=\"ipn.gov.pl-1\" />\n\nThe Committee for Public Security took responsibility for [[Intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] and counter-espionage, government security and the secret police. From September 3, 1955 to November 28, 1956 it also controlled the Polish Army's [[G\u0142\u00f3wny Zarz\u0105d Informacji Wojska Polskiego|Main Directorate of Information]] (''G\u0142\u00f3wny Zarz\u0105d Informacji Wojska''), which ran the [[Military Police]] and counter espionage service. The Ministry of Interior was responsible for the supervision of local governments, the [[Milicja Obywatelska]] (Citizens' Militia, MO) police force, correctional facilities, fire and rescue forces, and the border guard. In 1956 the Committee was dissolved, most of its functions merged into Ministry of Interior; the secret police was renamed to the 'Security Service' (''S\u0142u\u017cba Bezpiecze\u0144stwa'' or SB) on 28 November 1956.<ref name=\"ipn.gov.pl-1\" /> The order was made by [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Wicha]], who was the incumbent Minister of Interior until 1964.\n\n===SB activities===\nThe repressions of political opponents were revived following the [[1968 Polish political crisis]]. With the emergence of the Solidarity movement in 1980, [[Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa]] was under constant SB surveillance. Throughout the [[martial law in Poland|martial law]] (1981-1983), SB played a key role in [[wiretapping]] telephones in public areas and institutions. It also participated in [[Entryism|infiltrating]] Solidarity's committees and gatherings.\n\nThe torture and execution  of Catholic priest [[Jerzy Popie\u0142uszko]] by SB members in 1984 shook Poland. The agency is also suspected of killing [[Stanis\u0142aw Pyjas]], Catholic priest Stefan Niedzielak, and is reported to have abused priest [[Roman Kotlarz]], who died mysteriously<ref>KOR, A history of the Worker's Defense Committee in Poland, 1976 \u2013 1981, by Jan J\u00f3sef Lipski, Translated by Olga Amsterdamska and Gene M.

The Ministry of Public Security structure was being changed constantly from January 1945 on, as the Ministry expanded. It was divided into departments and each department was subdivided into sections entrusted with different tasks. In January 1945, the largest and the most important department in UB was Department One, responsible for ''counter-espionage'' and ''anti-state activities''. It was headed by General [[Roman Romkowski]]. ''Department I'' was divided into Sections, each responsible for a different but specific function ''self-described'' in the following way:\n# Fighting German espionage and Nazi underground remaining in Poland.\n# Fighting reactionary underground.\n# Fighting political banditry.\n# Protection of the national economy.\n# Protection of legal political parties from outside (underground) penetration.\n# Prisons.\n# Observation.\n# Investigations.\n\nTwo new departments were formed in addition to departments and sections created for the Resort Bezpiecze\u0144stwa Publicznego (RBP) forming the core of '''MBP''' or UB in January 1945. On September 6, 1945, from the existing structure of ''Department II'' emerged three additional departments: ''Department IV'' commanded by Aleksander Wolski-Dyszko, ''Department V'' commanded by [[Julia Brystygier]], and ''Department VI'' headed by [[Teodor Duda]] ''[[:pl:Teodor Duda|(pl)]]''. In July 1946, further changes were enacted. UB was divided into eight (8) departments, five of which dealt with operational cases, including ''Counter-espionage'' (Dep 1), ''Technical operations and technology'' (Dep 2), ''Fighting underground resistance'' (Dep 3), ''Protection of economy'' (Dep 4), and ''Counteraction of hostile penetration and church influences'' (Dep 5).<ref name=\"ipn.gov.pl-1\" />\n\nIn June 1948 the ''Secret Office'' was established for ''Internal'' counter-intelligence. The Special Office conducted surveillance on members of the MPB itself. On March 2, 1949, the ''Special Bureau'' was established, renamed in 1951 simply as ''Department Ten''. Department 10 conducted surveillance of high-ranking members of the [[Polish United Workers' Party]] and people associated with them.<ref name=\"ipn.gov.pl-1\" />\n\n=== Ministry of Public Security roster (1951 and 1953) ===\n[[File:Organization of the Ministerstwo Bezpieczenstwa Publicznego 1953.png|thumb|300px|Ministry of Public Security organization for 1953, (Organizacja Ministerstwa Bezpiecze\u0144stwa Publicznego na rok 1953, M Malinowski)]]\n<small>\n;[[Minister (government)|Minister]] of Public Security \u2013 Gen.

There was one, or more UB office in each [[voivodeship]], each of them called the Voivode Office of Public Security (''Wojew\u00f3dzki Urz\u0105d Bezpiecze\u0144stwa Publicznego'', or WUBP). Each WUBP had 308 full-time UB officers and employees on staff. Beside WUBP, there were also City Offices of Public Security (''Miejski Urz\u0105d Bezpiecze\u0144stwa Publicznego'' or MUBP), with 148 MPB officers and employees; as well as District Offices of Public Security (''Powiatowy Urz\u0105d Bezpiecze\u0144stwa Publicznego'' or PUBP), with 51 officers and employees; and finally, the Communal Offices of Public Security (''Gminny Urz\u0105d Bezpiecze\u0144stwa Publicznego'', or GUBP), which were stationed at the local militia precincts ([[Milicja Obywatelska|MO]]), with 3 UBP security officers on staff.<ref name=\"ipn.gov.pl-1\" />\n\nIn 1953, in the field, there were 17 Voivode Offices of Public Security (WUBP), and 2 Regional Offices of Public Security on the order of WUBP. There were 268 District Offices of Public Security (PUBP) and 5 City Offices of Public Security (MUBP), which operated as District Offices of Public Security (PUBP). Together, they employed 33,200 permanent officers, of which 7,500 were stationed in their [[Warsaw]] [[headquarters]]. According to professor [[Andrzej Paczkowski]], in 1953, there was one UB officer for every 800 Polish citizens. Never again, in the 45-year-old history of the [[People's Republic of Poland]], were its special services' formations so large in numbers.<ref name=\"Paczkowski\">{{cite book | title=P\u00f3\u0142 wieku dziej\u00f3w Polski 1939-1989 (Half a Century of the History of Poland 1939-1989) | publisher=Wydawnictwo Naukowe PWN | author=Prof. [[Andrzej Paczkowski]], [[Institute of National Remembrance]] | year=2000 | location=[[Warsaw]] | isbn=  978-83-01-14487-6 }}</ref>\n\n== Soviet infiltration and political repressions ==\nPolitical penetration and military control over the country by the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Soviet Union]] was evident in the early years of the Polish People's Republic. The Soviet [[Northern Group of Forces]] was stationed in Poland until 1956. The command and administrative structure of the Polish Armed Forces, [[Intelligence]], [[Counter-intelligence]], special services and Internal security organs both civilian (UB) and military ([[Main Directorate of Information of the Polish Army]] GZI WP) were infiltrated by Soviet intelligence and counter-intelligence officers, who served as the main guarantee of pro-Soviet policy of the new Polish socialist state. The Red Army provided assistance to MPB not only in the form of advisors, but also with their own paramilitary units including [[NKGB]], [[NKVD]], [[GRU]], [[SMERSH]]; and, in later years [[Ministry for State Security (Soviet Union)|MGB]], [[MVD]] and [[KGB]].<ref name=\"ipn.gov.pl-1\" />\n\nThe first Russian chief advisor to the MPB was [[Major General]] [[Ivan Serov]], a well-trained Stalinist experienced with Soviet security organs. Serov became commander of the NKVD-run militsiya during World War II. He worked as chief of the NKVD Secret Political Department, before becoming [[People's Commissar]] of Internal Affairs of the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] in the USSR. In 1941\u20131945, he was the First Deputy People's Commissar of the State Security and later \u2013 Deputy People's Commissar of Internal Affairs of the Soviet Union. Once he became main advisor to the UB in March 1945, Ivan Serov oversaw the kidnapping of 16 top Polish politicians and underground resistance leaders, secretly transported them to [[Moscow]], where they were tortured and thrown into jail after the staged [[Trial of the Sixteen]].

The next day, American military authorities transported \u015awiat\u0142o to [[Frankfurt]] and by December, \u015awiat\u0142o had been flown to Washington D.C, where he underwent an extensive debriefing.<ref name=\"ipn.gov.pl-1\" />\n\n[[File:Swiatlo.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[J\u00f3zef \u015awiat\u0142o]], born Izaak Fleischfarb, defected to the West and spoke publicly of UB's brutal actions]]\n\n\u015awiat\u0142o's defection was widely publicized in the United States and Europe by the American authorities, as well as in Poland via [[Radio Free Europe]], embarrassing the authorities in Warsaw. \u015awiat\u0142o had intimate knowledge of the internal politics of the Polish government, especially the activities of the various secret services. Over the course of the following months, American newspapers and Radio Free Europe reported extensively on political repression in Poland based on \u015awiat\u0142o revelations, including the [[torture]] of prisoners under interrogation and politically motivated executions. \u015awiat\u0142o also detailed struggles inside the [[Polish United Workers' Party]].<ref name=\"ipn.gov.pl-1\" />\n\nAmong other activities, \u015awiat\u0142o had been ordered to falsify evidence that was used to incriminate [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka]], whom he personally arrested. He had also arrested and falsified evidence against [[Marian Spychalski]], the future [[Minister of National Defence (Poland)|Minister of National Defence]], who was at the time a leading politician and high-ranking military officer.\n\n== 1954 reorganization and formation of SB ==\nThe highly publicized defection of Colonel \u015awiat\u0142o, not to mention the general hatred of the Ministry of Public Security among the Polish public led to changes in late 1954. In December of that year, the [[Polish Council of State]] and the [[Council of Ministers of Poland|Council of Ministers]] decided to replace the ministry with two separate administrations: the [[Committee for Public Security]] (''Komitet do Spraw Bezpiecze\u0144stwa Publicznego'' or KDSBP), headed by [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Dworakowski]], and the Ministry of Interior (''Ministerstwo Spraw Wewn\u0119trznych'' or MSW), headed by [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Wicha]]. The number of employees of the Committee for Public Security was cut by 30% in central headquarters and by 40\u201350% in local structures. The huge network of secret informers was also substantially reduced and the most implicated functionaries of the Ministry of Public Security were arrested. Surveillance and repressive activities were reduced; in the majority of factories, special cells of public security, set up to spy on workers, were secretly closed.<ref name=\"ipn.gov.pl-1\" />\n\nThe Committee for Public Security took responsibility for [[Intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] and counter-espionage, government security and the secret police. From September 3, 1955 to November 28, 1956 it also controlled the Polish Army's [[G\u0142\u00f3wny Zarz\u0105d Informacji Wojska Polskiego|Main Directorate of Information]] (''G\u0142\u00f3wny Zarz\u0105d Informacji Wojska''), which ran the [[Military Police]] and counter espionage service. The Ministry of Interior was responsible for the supervision of local governments, the [[Milicja Obywatelska]] (Citizens' Militia, MO) police force, correctional facilities, fire and rescue forces, and the border guard. In 1956 the Committee was dissolved, most of its functions merged into Ministry of Interior; the secret police was renamed to the 'Security Service' (''S\u0142u\u017cba Bezpiecze\u0144stwa'' or SB) on 28 November 1956.<ref name=\"ipn.gov.pl-1\" /> The order was made by [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Wicha]], who was the incumbent Minister of Interior until 1964.\n\n===SB activities===\nThe repressions of political opponents were revived following the [[1968 Polish political crisis]]. With the emergence of the Solidarity movement in 1980, [[Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa]] was under constant SB surveillance.

When Sisko's visions become more frequent and pervasive, [[Julian Bashir|Dr. Bashir]] examines him, and finds similar brain activity to a prior episode of visions Sisko experienced (in the episode \"[[Rapture (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Rapture]]\").\n\nSuddenly, Sisko is taken over by his vision, becoming Benny Russell, an African-American science fiction writer in 1950s [[New York City]]. Russell writes for the science fiction magazine ''Incredible Tales'' and most of the people he encounters bear the likeness of people from Sisko's life on the station. He runs into his coworker Albert Macklin ([[Colm Meaney]]/[[Miles O'Brien (Star Trek)|O'Brien]]) and the two walk to work together. There, short-tempered liberal writer Herbert Rossoff ([[Armin Shimerman]]/[[Quark (Star Trek)|Quark]]) argues with magazine editor Douglas Pabst ([[Ren\u00e9 Auberjonois]]/[[Odo (Star Trek)|Odo]]) over donuts, while writers Kay Eaton, a.k.a. K. C. Hunter ([[Nana Visitor]]/[[Kira Nerys|Kira]]) and Julius Eaton ([[Alexander Siddig]]/[[Julian Bashir|Bashir)]] banter in the background. The magazine's illustrator Roy Ritterhouse ([[J. G. Hertzler]]/[[Martok]]) arrives with a stack of sketches for the next edition. Russell is particularly drawn to a sketch of a space station much like Deep Space 9, and decides to write a story for it. When Pabst announces the next edition will include photos of the staff, he suggests Kay \"sleep late\" that morning, as the public would not respond well to the revelation she is a woman. Russell objects, realizing that he will be excluded too, but Pabst stands firm, choosing to conform to the prevailing public opinion.\n\nLeaving the office that night, a gust of wind takes Russell's drawing, which lands at the feet of two police officers, Burt Ryan ([[Marc Alaimo]]/[[Dukat (Star Trek)|Dukat]]) and Kevin Mulkahey ([[Jeffrey Combs]]/Weyoun). The officers hassle and question Russell but let him go with a \"warning\". Russell then encounters a preacher ([[Brock Peters]]/[[Joseph Sisko]]) who seems to be speaking directly to him, imploring him to \"write those words\" in the name of \"the [[Prophets (Star Trek)|Prophets]]\". He goes home and begins to write.\n\nSome time later, he finishes his story, \"Deep Space Nine\", about a black captain of a space station. He shows it to his girlfriend Cassie ([[Penny Johnson Jerald]]/[[Kasidy Yates]]), who instead wants the two of them to buy the diner where she works, doubting his ability to earn a good living as a writer. A local hustler, Jimmy ([[Cirroc Lofton]]/[[Jake Sisko]]), laughs at his idea of \"colored people on the Moon\". At the magazine, the entire staff loves his story, especially Pabst's new secretary Darlene Kursky ([[Terry Farrell (actress)|Terry Farrell]]/[[Jadzia Dax|Dax]]). Pabst refuses to print it and Russell refuses to change his story.\n\nInstead of rewriting the story for Pabst, Russell decides to write six sequels to his story, angering Pabst, until Macklin devises a compromise: Russell's story will be a dream. Russell insists the dreamer also be black, to which Pabst consents. While Russell and Cassie are out celebrating, they hear gunshots and find that Jimmy has been shot and killed by Officers Ryan and Mulkahey, ostensibly for trying to break into a car. When Benny protests this injustice, they beat him savagely.\n\nWeeks later, on his first day back at the office, Benny is excited to see his story in print. Pabst arrives empty-handed and informs the writers that the whole month's run of the magazine has been pulped; the owner wouldn't publish a story featuring a black hero. Pabst tells Benny he is being forced to fire him as well. Benny breaks down; he screams that they cannot destroy his ideas and the future he envisions is real. He collapses to the floor sobbing and is taken away by an ambulance. As he falls unconscious, he looks through the window and, rather than the city, sees stars streaking past. The preacher sits by him and tells him that he is both the dreamer and the dream. Sisko wakes up back on the station. He is deeply moved by his vision and wonders if somewhere, far beyond the stars, Benny Russell is dreaming of Deep Space Nine.\n\n== Production ==\n=== Conception ===\nZicree's original pitch for the episode featured [[Jake Sisko]] as the main character, and did not deal directly with racial issues. Zicree originally patterned the Bashir/Kira characters on [[Henry Kuttner]] and [[C. L. Moore]], and the O'Brien character on [[Isaac Asimov]].{{sfn|Nazzaro|1998|pages=42\u201346}} This story was combined with ideas that story editor [[Robert Hewitt Wolfe]] had written for a script called \"Cold and Distant Stars\", a very early draft for the Season Three two-part episode \"[[Past Tense (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Past Tense]]\". The story, suggested by Wolfe, featured Sisko as a contemporary homeless man who believes he is a star base captain, but who is diagnosed as schizophrenic and drugged to suppress his visions. At that time, producer [[Ira Steven Behr]] had rejected the hallucinatory element in favor of a time-travel story, because it felt too much like a \"gimmick\".{{sfn|Erdmann|Block|2000|page=196}}{{sfn|Erdmann|Block|2000|page=534-537}} Researcher Allen Kwan wrote that the episode may have originally featured a more positive ending, where instead of showing Benny being institutionalized, it would show him on a set, producing an episode of ''Deep Space Nine''. Supposedly, that ending was not used for fears of breaking the continuity of the franchise.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Kwan|first=Allen|date=February 1, 2007|title=Seeking New Civilizations: Race Normativity in the Star Trek Franchise|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ad46/28ef202599e8f92911b35c476709eedb8533.pdf|url-status=dead|journal=[[Bulletin of Science, Technology & Society]]|volume=27|issue=1|pages=59-70|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200229190619/https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ad46/28ef202599e8f92911b35c476709eedb8533.pdf|archive-date=29 February 2020|access-date=29 February 2020|via=}}</ref>\n\n=== Design ===\nMuch work was put into making their version of New York City as authentic to reality as possible. The production crew included several references to past Star Trek series and episodes- as well as to Deep Space Nine itself. Inside the office, memos from Pabst can be seen. For instance, one is addressed to Rossoff, complaining to him that \"no one would believe that a cheerleader could kill vampires\", a reference to Shimmerman's work on [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]].{{sfn|Erdmann|Block|2000|page=534-537}}\n\nBrooks, who both directed the episode and played Sisko/Russel, went to great lengths to ensure period authenticity, even during post-production. Brooks went to the music spotting session, and had long discussions about things such as what music Russel would dance to, and the style of the scoring. The only other ''Star Trek'' director to attend a music spotting session was [[LeVar Burton]], when working on [[Star Trek: The Next Generation|''Star Trek: The Next Generation'']]. Inequality was also portrayed through design; the ambulance which carries Benny was portrayed as dirty and outdated because, as Brooks notes, \"that's what they would have sent.\"{{sfn|Erdmann|Block|2000|page=534-537}}\n\n=== Filming and makeup ===\n[[File:QTXP 20121019 Destination Star Trek London MG 2144.jpg|alt=Avery Brooks|left|thumb|Avery Brooks both directed the episode and played Sisko/Russel]]The episode was directed by Avery Brooks, who also played Sisko/Russel. He was chosen by the production staff because they wanted a director who had experienced racism.{{sfn|Erdmann|Block|2000|page=534-537}} The scene where Russel collapses and has a breakdown was perhaps more realistic then most fans had realized. Once the assistant director called cut, Brooks did not stop. Brooks was so into the part that, as Lou Race remarked, even if he had stayed for half an hour, Brooks would have \"kept on\".<ref>{{cite AV media|url=|title=What We Left Behind: Looking Back at Star Trek: Deep Space Nine|date=May 13, 2019|people=|first=|type=Motion picture|language=|publisher=[[Shout! Factory]]|location=|time=|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|format=|ref=|id=|oclc=|quote=|medium=}}</ref>\n\nOne of the few examples of [[Special effect|special effects]] in the episode was the shot where Russell's drawing of the station falls out of his hand, and lands near the foot of a racist police officer. The drawing was attached to a helium balloon which was connected to some [[Monofilament fishing line|monofilament]] on a fishing line. Then, it had to be \"yanked\" towards the foot of the police officer, while making sure it would land in the right direction for the camera. Despite concerns that it could take hundreds of tries, the shot was completed with only two attempts.{{sfn|Erdmann|Block|2000|page=534-537}}\n\nMakeup was unusually easy for this episode; since most characters appeared as human, only minimal makeup was required. Shimmerman said that wearing a mask had been his mechanism for support, it recused him from being nervous about how he looked on camera. Appearing without one, then, was a \"very bizarre\" experience. Even though J.G Hertzler (Martok/Ritterhouse) had never appeared on ''Deep Space Nine'' out of makeup, he enjoyed the role. Hertzler has a drawing hobby, so when Ritterhouse was seen drawing in the episode, Hertzler was really drawing the cast.{{sfn|Erdmann|Block|2000|page=534-537}}\n\n== Reception ==\n[[The A.V.

Parallels, Kwan claimed, can be drawn from Pabst, the racist magazine editor, to the producers of the Star Trek franchise. Kwan maintains that, like Pabst, the franchise as a whole tends to ignore actual diversity, instead opting to portray a future with only a single cultural and racial norm.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n\n* {{cite magazine|url=http://titanmagazines.com/t/star-trek/us/40/|title=Going Far Beyond the Stars|first=Joe|last=Nazzaro|work=[[Star Trek Magazine]]|publisher=[[Titan Magazines]]|location=[[London]]|date=June 1998|pages=42\u201346|ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Space-Nine-Companion-Star/dp/0671501062|last1=Erdmann|first1=Terry|last2=Block|first2=Paula|title=The Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Companion|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|location=[[New York City]]|year=2000|doi=|edition=1st|isbn=978-0671501068|ref=harv}}\n\n{{Refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote|Star Trek: Deep Space Nine#Far Beyond the Stars .5B6.13.5D|\"Far Beyond the Stars\"}}\n* {{IMDb episode|0708538}}\n* {{tv.com episode|star-trek-deep-space-nine/far-beyond-the-stars-20963}}\n{{Memoryalpha|Far Beyond the Stars (episode)|\"Far Beyond the Stars\"}}\n* [http://memory-beta.wikia.com/wiki/Far_Beyond_the_Stars \"Far Beyond the Stars\"] at [http://memory-beta.wikia.com Memory Beta]\n{{StarTrek.com link|DS9|71932|\"Far Beyond the Stars\"}}\n\n{{Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episodes|6}}\n\n[[Category:Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (season 6) episodes]]\n[[Category:1998 American television episodes]]\n[[Category:Fiction set in 1953]]\n[[Category:Works about writers]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=April 2013}}\n{{Infobox television episode\n| title = Far Beyond the Stars\n| image =\n| caption =\n| series = [[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]\n| season = 6\n| episode = 13\n| production = 538\n| airdate = {{Start date|1998|02|11}}\n| story = [[Marc Scott Zicree]]\n| teleplay = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Ira Steven Behr]]\n* [[Hans Beimler (screenwriter)|Hans Beimler]]\n}}\n| director = [[Avery Brooks]]\n| photographer = Jonathan West\n| music = [[Dennis McCarthy (composer)|Dennis McCarthy]]\n| guests = \n* [[Brock Peters]] as Preacher / [[Joseph Sisko]]\n* [[Jeffrey Combs]] as Kevin Mulkahey / Weyoun\n* [[Marc Alaimo]] as Burt Ryan / [[Dukat (Star Trek)|Dukat]]\n* [[J.

The officers hassle and question Russell but let him go with a \"warning\". Russell then encounters a preacher ([[Brock Peters]]/[[Joseph Sisko]]) who seems to be speaking directly to him, imploring him to \"write those words\" in the name of \"the [[Prophets (Star Trek)|Prophets]]\". He goes home and begins to write.\n\nSome time later, he finishes his story, \"Deep Space Nine\", about a black captain of a space station. He shows it to his girlfriend Cassie ([[Penny Johnson Jerald]]/[[Kasidy Yates]]), who instead wants the two of them to buy the diner where she works, doubting his ability to earn a good living as a writer. A local hustler, Jimmy ([[Cirroc Lofton]]/[[Jake Sisko]]), laughs at his idea of \"colored people on the Moon\". At the magazine, the entire staff loves his story, especially Pabst's new secretary Darlene Kursky ([[Terry Farrell (actress)|Terry Farrell]]/[[Jadzia Dax|Dax]]). Pabst refuses to print it and Russell refuses to change his story.\n\nInstead of rewriting the story for Pabst, Russell decides to write six sequels to his story, angering Pabst, until Macklin devises a compromise: Russell's story will be a dream. Russell insists the dreamer also be black, to which Pabst consents. While Russell and Cassie are out celebrating, they hear gunshots and find that Jimmy has been shot and killed by Officers Ryan and Mulkahey, ostensibly for trying to break into a car. When Benny protests this injustice, they beat him savagely.\n\nWeeks later, on his first day back at the office, Benny is excited to see his story in print. Pabst arrives empty-handed and informs the writers that the whole month's run of the magazine has been pulped; the owner wouldn't publish a story featuring a black hero. Pabst tells Benny he is being forced to fire him as well. Benny breaks down; he screams that they cannot destroy his ideas and the future he envisions is real. He collapses to the floor sobbing and is taken away by an ambulance. As he falls unconscious, he looks through the window and, rather than the city, sees stars streaking past. The preacher sits by him and tells him that he is both the dreamer and the dream. Sisko wakes up back on the station. He is deeply moved by his vision and wonders if somewhere, far beyond the stars, Benny Russell is dreaming of Deep Space Nine.\n\n== Production ==\n=== Conception ===\nZicree's original pitch for the episode featured [[Jake Sisko]] as the main character, and did not deal directly with racial issues. Zicree originally patterned the Bashir/Kira characters on [[Henry Kuttner]] and [[C. L. Moore]], and the O'Brien character on [[Isaac Asimov]].{{sfn|Nazzaro|1998|pages=42\u201346}} This story was combined with ideas that story editor [[Robert Hewitt Wolfe]] had written for a script called \"Cold and Distant Stars\", a very early draft for the Season Three two-part episode \"[[Past Tense (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Past Tense]]\". The story, suggested by Wolfe, featured Sisko as a contemporary homeless man who believes he is a star base captain, but who is diagnosed as schizophrenic and drugged to suppress his visions. At that time, producer [[Ira Steven Behr]] had rejected the hallucinatory element in favor of a time-travel story, because it felt too much like a \"gimmick\".{{sfn|Erdmann|Block|2000|page=196}}{{sfn|Erdmann|Block|2000|page=534-537}} Researcher Allen Kwan wrote that the episode may have originally featured a more positive ending, where instead of showing Benny being institutionalized, it would show him on a set, producing an episode of ''Deep Space Nine''. Supposedly, that ending was not used for fears of breaking the continuity of the franchise.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Kwan|first=Allen|date=February 1, 2007|title=Seeking New Civilizations: Race Normativity in the Star Trek Franchise|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ad46/28ef202599e8f92911b35c476709eedb8533.pdf|url-status=dead|journal=[[Bulletin of Science, Technology & Society]]|volume=27|issue=1|pages=59-70|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200229190619/https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ad46/28ef202599e8f92911b35c476709eedb8533.pdf|archive-date=29 February 2020|access-date=29 February 2020|via=}}</ref>\n\n=== Design ===\nMuch work was put into making their version of New York City as authentic to reality as possible. The production crew included several references to past Star Trek series and episodes- as well as to Deep Space Nine itself. Inside the office, memos from Pabst can be seen. For instance, one is addressed to Rossoff, complaining to him that \"no one would believe that a cheerleader could kill vampires\", a reference to Shimmerman's work on [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]].{{sfn|Erdmann|Block|2000|page=534-537}}\n\nBrooks, who both directed the episode and played Sisko/Russel, went to great lengths to ensure period authenticity, even during post-production. Brooks went to the music spotting session, and had long discussions about things such as what music Russel would dance to, and the style of the scoring. The only other ''Star Trek'' director to attend a music spotting session was [[LeVar Burton]], when working on [[Star Trek: The Next Generation|''Star Trek: The Next Generation'']]. Inequality was also portrayed through design; the ambulance which carries Benny was portrayed as dirty and outdated because, as Brooks notes, \"that's what they would have sent\".{{sfn|Erdmann|Block|2000|page=534-537}}\n\n=== Filming and makeup ===\n[[File:QTXP 20121019 Destination Star Trek London MG 2144.jpg|alt=Avery Brooks|left|thumb|Avery Brooks both directed the episode and played Sisko/Russel]]The episode was directed by Avery Brooks, who also played Sisko/Russel. He was chosen by the production staff because they wanted a director who had experienced racism.{{sfn|Erdmann|Block|2000|page=534-537}} The scene where Russel collapses and has a breakdown was perhaps more realistic then most fans had realized. Once the assistant director called cut, Brooks did not stop. Brooks was so into the part that, as Lou Race remarked, even if he had stayed for half an hour, Brooks would have \"kept on\".<ref>{{cite AV media|url=|title=What We Left Behind: Looking Back at Star Trek: Deep Space Nine|date=May 13, 2019|people=|first=|type=Motion picture|language=|publisher=[[Shout!

The drawing was attached to a helium balloon which was connected to some [[Monofilament fishing line|monofilament]] on a fishing line. Then, it had to be \"yanked\" towards the foot of the police officer, while making sure it would land in the right direction for the camera. Despite concerns that it could take hundreds of tries, the shot was completed with only two attempts.{{sfn|Erdmann|Block|2000|page=534-537}}\n\nMakeup was unusually easy for this episode; since most characters appeared as human, only minimal makeup was required. Shimmerman said that wearing a mask had been his mechanism for support, it recused him from being nervous about how he looked on camera. Appearing without one, then, was a \"very bizarre\" experience. Even though J.G Hertzler (Martok/Ritterhouse) had never appeared on ''Deep Space Nine'' out of makeup, he enjoyed the role. Hertzler has a drawing hobby, so when Ritterhouse was seen drawing in the episode, Hertzler was really drawing the cast.{{sfn|Erdmann|Block|2000|page=534-537}}\n\n== Reception ==\n[[The A.V. Club]]'s Zach Handlen said that by escaping the \"trap\" of cloaking its concerns in \"pure symbol\" that some other ''Star Trek'' episodes fall into, the episode ends up creating something unique.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tv.avclub.com/star-trek-deep-space-nine-far-beyond-the-stars-1798178688|title=Star Trek: Deep Space Nine: \"Far Beyond The Stars\"|last=Handlen|first=Zack|date=November 14, 2013|website=[[The A.V Club]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200214181324/https://tv.avclub.com/star-trek-deep-space-nine-far-beyond-the-stars-1798178688|archive-date=February 14, 2020|access-date=February 14, 2020}}</ref> [[Empire (film magazine)|''Empire'']] ranked \"Far Beyond the Stars\" 4th out of the 50 top episodes of all ''Star Trek'' in 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/best-star-trek-episodes/|title=The 50 best Star Trek episodes ever|date=2016-07-27|website=Empire|language=en|access-date=2019-07-02}}</ref> At that time, there were roughly 726 episodes and a dozen films released.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tomsguide.com/us/star-trek-binge-watching-guide,review-3635.html|title=How to Binge Watch 726 Star Trek Episodes (and 12 Movies)|last=Honorof|first=Marshall|date=May 17, 2016|website=Tom's Guide|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=July 2, 2016}}</ref> A 2015 [[binge-watching]] guide for ''Star Trek: Deep Space Nine'' by [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] recommended not skipping this \"essential\" episode.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/05/binge-guide-star-trek-ds9/|title=WIRED Binge-Watching Guide: Star Trek: Deep Space Nine|last=McMillan|first=Graeme|date=2015-05-13|work=Wired|access-date=2019-07-23|issn=1059-1028}}</ref> In 2019, ''Den of Geek'' included this among the top 12 best morality plays of the ''Star Trek'' franchise.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/us/go/278483|title=Star Trek's 12 Best Morality Plays|website=Den of Geek|language=en|access-date=2019-06-12}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Chicago Tribune]] praised the episode, and claimed it would \"shatter whatever remnants of that opposition [to Avery Brook's casting which still] linger\".<ref>{{Cite news|last=Johnson|first=Allan|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/49606499/the-chicago-tribunes-review-of-star/|title=Back to the future|date=February 10, 1998|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|access-date=April 26, 2020|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200426170845/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/49606499/the-chicago-tribunes-review-of-star/|archive-date=April 26, 2020|page=59|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref> The [[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] agreed, and said that fans will consider this the \"most remarkable episode in the history of ''Deep Space Nine''.\"<ref>{{Cite news|last=Norman|first=Tony|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/49685463/the-pittsburgh-post-gazettes-review-of/|title='Deep Space Nine' episode boldly faces racism|date=February 14, 1998|work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|access-date=April 27, 2020|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200427165442/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/49685463/the-pittsburgh-post-gazettes-review-of/|archive-date=April 27, 2020|page=29|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref>\n\n=== Academic ===\nIn a paper published by the [[Bulletin of Science, Technology & Society]], Allen Kwan argued that while the episode should be \"given credit\" for portraying racism more directly than any other episode, the ending in which Russell is institutionalized weakens the moral of the story. Parallels, Kwan claimed, can be drawn from Pabst, the racist magazine editor, to the producers of the Star Trek franchise. Kwan maintains that, like Pabst, the franchise as a whole tends to ignore actual diversity, instead opting to portray a future with only a single cultural and racial norm.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n\n* {{cite magazine|url=http://titanmagazines.com/t/star-trek/us/40/|title=Going Far Beyond the Stars|first=Joe|last=Nazzaro|work=[[Star Trek Magazine]]|publisher=[[Titan Magazines]]|location=[[London]]|date=June 1998|pages=42\u201346|ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Space-Nine-Companion-Star/dp/0671501062|last1=Erdmann|first1=Terry|last2=Block|first2=Paula|title=The Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Companion|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|location=[[New York City]]|year=2000|doi=|edition=1st|isbn=978-0671501068|ref=harv}}\n\n{{Refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote|Star Trek: Deep Space Nine#Far Beyond the Stars .5B6.13.5D|\"Far Beyond the Stars\"}}\n* {{IMDb episode|0708538}}\n* {{tv.com episode|star-trek-deep-space-nine/far-beyond-the-stars-20963}}\n{{Memoryalpha|Far Beyond the Stars (episode)|\"Far Beyond the Stars\"}}\n* [http://memory-beta.wikia.com/wiki/Far_Beyond_the_Stars \"Far Beyond the Stars\"] at [http://memory-beta.wikia.com Memory Beta]\n{{StarTrek.com link|DS9|71932|\"Far Beyond the Stars\"}}\n\n{{Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episodes|6}}\n\n[[Category:Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (season 6) episodes]]\n[[Category:1998 American television episodes]]\n[[Category:Fiction set in 1953]]\n[[Category:Works about writers]]\n", "name_user": "TheAwesomeHwyh", "label": "safe", "comment": "minor ce", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_Beyond_the_Stars"}

The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of PPE, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI /> As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/ \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nThe CDC focuses on both containment, to keep the virus from spreading after detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits.

The plot below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all four y axes on one plot to show relationships between the trends. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of 10. This makes the slope of the plot the relative rate of change anywhere in the timeline, which allows comparison of one plot with the others throughout the pandemic.<!--One option in the Graph:Chart template, \"yScaleType=log\" makes this happen; this option was added for this article and is not yet documented in the template.

The plot below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all four y axes on one plot to show relationships between the trends. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of 10. This makes the slope of the plot the relative rate of change anywhere in the timeline, which allows comparison of one plot with the others throughout the pandemic.<!--One option in the Graph:Chart template, \"yScaleType=log\" makes this happen; this option was added for this article and is not yet documented in the template.

A vital food source, bison numbers had been dwindling since the 1760s due to overhunting by the British, Canadian and aboriginal inhabitants of the prairies.{{sfn|Daschuk|2013|p=}} Due to the untenability of their traditional livelihood, many [[Anishnabe]] welcomed the arrival of the Red River colonists in hopes that they might bring salvation to the prairies.{{sfn|Daschuk|2013|p=}}\n\nIn July 1811, [[Miles Macdonell]] sailed from [[Great Yarmouth|Yarmouth]], [[England]] to the Hudson's Bay post at [[York Factory]] with 36 primarily Irish and Scottish settlers.{{sfn|Carter|1968}} Due to persuasive efforts of the North West Company, only 18 settlers actually arrived at Red River in August 1812.{{sfn|Carter|1968}} As the planting season had ended before the settlers could complete the construction of [[Fort Douglas (Canada)|Fort Douglas]], they were forced to hunt bison for food and were completely unprepared for the arrival of 120 additional settlers in October.{{sfn|Carter|1968}} More settlers were scheduled to arrive in 1813, but due to a fever outbreak on their ship, they did not arrive until June 21, 1814.{{sfn|Carter|1968}} Dogged by poor harvests and a growing population, Macdonell, now governor of Red River, issued the [[Pemmican Proclamation]] in January 1814 to prevent the export of [[pemmican]] from the colony.{{sfn|Carter|1968}} In doing so, Macdonell undermined the security of Red River and plunged the colony into a conflict with the North West Company that would not end until 1821.\n\n==War between the companies==\nThe [[Pemmican War]] that was initiated by Macdonell's proclamation was only the tail end of a much larger conflict between the Hudson's Bay Company and its fur trade rivals, both English and French, in Montreal.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|url = |title = Industrial Experiments in the Wilderness: A sidelight on the Business History of the Hudson's Bay Company|last = Gluek|first = Alvin|date = 1958|journal = The Business History Review|volume = 32|issue = 4|pages = 423\u2013433|doi = 10.2307/3111662|pmid = |access-date = |jstor = 3111662}}</ref> The conflict dates back to [[King Charles II of England|King Charles II]]'s generous grant of Rupert's Land to members of the English nobility in 1670.<ref name=\":3\" /> Cause for conflict arose from the inability of either the Montreal traders or the Hudson's Bay Company to gain a monopoly over the [[North American fur trade]].<ref name=\":3\" /> Between 1800 and 1821, the conflict between Hudson's Bay and Montreal, at that point represented by the predominantly Scottish North West Company, intensified.{{sfn|Davies|1966}}\nThe conflict reached its peak in 1801 and witnessed both companies expending more resources on out-competing each other than were expended on the exploration of new fur grounds.{{sfn|Davies|1966}} Between 1803\u20131804, Hudson's Bay morale had plummeted in the face of fierce Northwest competition and forced the two companies into negotiations but neither side could come to terms.{{sfn|Davies|1966}} Negotiations broke down again in 1805 and despite employing more aggressive agents and the provision of incentive programs, the Hudson's Bay Company was ready to abandon the fur trade in 1809.{{sfn|Davies|1966}} The Nor'Westers ability to make region-wide plans based on first-hand knowledge in addition to their ability to react quickly to changing circumstances provided the North West Company with a decisive advantage prior to 1810.{{sfn|Davies|1966}} After 1810, the combination of new management within the Hudson's Bay Company and the approval of a company-sponsored colony at Red River put the North West Company on the defensive.{{sfn|Davies|1966}} The establishment of a Hudson's Bay colony in the Red River region denied the Nor'Westers access to vital supplies and restricted the company's ability to expand westwards.<ref name=\"Gibson\" /> Additionally, the establishment of an agricultural colony made the Hudson's Bay company nondependent on the profitable fur trade, a factor that the Nor'Westers simply could not compete with.{{sfn|Davies|1966}} Moreover, by establishing an agricultural colony, the Hudson's Bay Company gained a decisive advantage over the North West Company by virtue of a viable fallback economy as well as a readily available food source during economic slumps.{{sfn|Davies|1966}} Much of this new-found confidence hinged on the Selkirk's success at Red River and resulted in the colony becoming the central focus of seven years of inter-company warfare.{{sfn|Carter|1968}}\n\nRed River first came under attack from the North West Company in the summer of 1815.{{sfn|Carter|1968}} Convinced that Macdonell's proclamation was a deliberate attempt to block Northwest trade, the company destroyed [[Fort Douglas (Canada)|Fort Douglas]] and burned down all of the surrounding buildings.{{sfn|Carter|1968}}<ref>R.

With the end of the fur trade inspired conflicts on the plains, the Red River settlement was able to grow. The agricultural products, primarily wheat, began to rise in yearly yields. Flour production rose from over {{convert|20000|lb|kg|order=flip}} annually from 1823 to 1829 to over {{convert|30000|lb|kg|order=flip|abbr=on}} in the early 1830s.<ref name=Gibson/> The supply of flour reached over {{convert|50000|lb|kg|order=flip|abbr=on}} by the mid-1830s, rapidly deflating the price the HBC paid the farmers for the product.

Despite such efforts, Britain eventually ceded all claim to land south of the 49th parallel of latitude west of the Rockies to the United States as a resolution to the [[Oregon boundary dispute]].\n\n== Women in the Colony ==\nThe position of many women in the Red River Colony was determined within the [[Hudson Bay Company]]'s 1670 Charter; this document gave legislative and judicial powers in Rupert's Land to the company. It is stated within the Charter that the legal status of women is as dependents of a male authority, which included fathers, husbands or brothers.<ref name=FitzGerald2007>{{cite journal |last1=FitzGerald |first1=Sharron A. |title=Hybrid identities in Canada's Red River Colony |journal=The Canadian Geographer |date=June 2007 |volume=51 |issue=2 |pages=186\u2013201 |doi=10.1111/j.1541-0064.2007.00173.x }}</ref> Although women's agency was limited through the inclusion of British laws, it was also empowered by these same laws.\n\nFor example, Maria Thomas- a 16-year-old Anglo-Cree [[M\u00e9tis]] domestic servant, took her English Reverent employer to court for repeatedly raping her and subjecting her to illegal abortions.<ref name=FitzGerald2007/> Thomas, in her testimony, used the laws in place to challenge her assaulter's actions.

The fur trade proper is merely a selected moment of time from a fuller spectrum of exchange that was embedded in particular social relations.<ref name=\":4\">{{cite journal |last1=Kirk |first1=Sylvia Van |title=The Role of Native Women in the Fur Trade Society of Western Canada, 1670-1830 |journal=Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies |date=1984 |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=9\u201313 |doi=10.2307/3346234 |jstor=3346234 }}</ref>\n\nThe fur trade was based on a complex set of relationships between two very different groups who held jagged worldviews. Various women belonging to the tribes of Ojibway, the Cree, and Chipewayan who were part of forming this relationship created a unique situation for Indigenous women. They became women who could walk between both distinct worlds. They became women who provided leadership in these spaces. They became an integral part of their culture economically as they used their femininity to operate under settler patriarchal law and took part in the fur trade. These women acted as allies of the whites and in certain circumstances permitted individual women to gain positions as an influence within settler society and act as social brokers between the two groups. Indigenous women took up their responsibilities and became active agents in the development of Indigenous and settler relations with the thought of their cultures survival and generations ahead in their heart.<ref name=\":6\">{{cite journal |last1=Van Kirk |first1=Sylvia |title='Women in Between': Indian Women in Fur Trade Society in Western Canada |journal=Historical Papers |date=20 April 2006 |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=30\u201346 |doi=10.7202/030819ar |doi-access=free }}</ref>  \u00a0\n\nTo the First Nations women these marital alliances created a reciprocal bond which formed economical relationships with traders for their communities. Adopting settlers into their kinship circle confirmed the expected equitable privileges such as free access to posts and provisions. Although it is evident that settlers did not understand the depth of these relationships and would often violate previous negotiations as well as their marital wives. It is important to recognize how the lives of many walking in these opposing two worlds was unsparing. Indigenous women involved in these relationships were often abused by their settler spouses.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nFirst Nation women came from a society that was organized to maintain the balance between men and women. In regard to marital relationships, women had the authority to institute a divorce if her marriage proved unsatisfactory. Within the fur trade society, traders would often place their wives with another man in the practice known as \u201cturning off\u201d in an attempt to provide a temporary \u201cprotector\u201d due to long separations between. Many women tried to resist but there was little that could be done as marriage under common law, in the New World, robbed women of their rights and created conditions for men to act tyrannically.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Sisters in Spirit: Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) Influence on Early American Feminists|last=Roesch Wagner|first=Sally|publisher=Native Voices Books|year=2001|isbn=|location=|pages=}}{{pn|date=December 2019}}</ref> \n\nThese laws arose with the formation of the government for the new world. The men reverted to England for their new model. The European tradition of the Catholic Church placed women in the role of property. British laws are traditionally based on the all sufficiently of man rights, and society operating under this form of patriarchy exist for women only if she is a man\u2019s object for keeping. A woman\u2019s very being or legal existence, Indigenous or non-Indigenous, was upended during marriage or consolidated into that of the husband under who she performs everything <ref name=\":2\" />. \n\nBy the end of the eighteenth century fur traders had built a nefarious trafficking of First Nations Women. Fur traders would often seize women by force for the reimbursement of trade debts, and then sold them to other settler men for large sums of money. In one instance, the Chipewyan began leaving their women behind when they came to trade. In 1792, when Hudson\u2019s Bay traders appeared on Lake Athabasca, the Chipewyan hoped to secure their support and drive out their rivals, the North-Western Company who had continuously assaulted the fathers and husbands for trying to release their women. The Chipewyan were eventually able to release their women during the summer months while the fur traders were away. Many First Nations women were welcomed back into their communities after their treatment by the whites as unwilling objects of transaction. Reinforced with experience, whites were no longer seen as a desirable husband.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nWith the broken relationship between fur traders and First Nations with the outright abuse of First Nations women along with the fact that marriage alliances were no longer a significant factor in trade relations from the settler perspective, led to a decline in \u201cthe practice of fur traders taking an Indian wife\u201d. One of the significant factors which changed the trader\u2019s attitude towards First Nations women was that they were no longer seen as an object that could walk in between two worlds for their economic gain. By the turn of the century, a group of mixed-blood women, metis, had emerged as a product of these previous relationships. In this context, metis women were created as a tool to perpetuate the social and economic agenda of the settler state. Fur traders now preferred metis women as their object of choice. In this way, First Nations women were replaced in fur trade society by metis women.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n== The Metis People of the Red River Colony ==\nThe mixed ethnicity of Indigenous and European peoples at the Red River Colony, known as Metis, were not always referred to by that name in the beginning years of their existence.

The Red River Colony. New York: New York, 1878: 50</ref>\n\nThe culture and lifestyle of the Metis community living in Red River were not only present at the colony. Metis people had a long-lasting tradition of a semi-annual, commercial, buffalo hunt that took place throughout the prairies starting in the mid-1700s with the western fur trade.<ref name=\"Macdougall & St-Onge 2013\">{{cite journal |last1=Macdougall |first1=Brenda |last2=St-Onge |first2=Nicole |title=Rooted in Mobility: Metis Buffalo-Hunting Brigades |journal=Manitoba History |volume=71 |issue=1 |year=2013 |pages=21\u201332 |url=https://search.proquest.com/openview/b687a93b0ad718b885305ad2860b28f9/1 }}</ref> The Hudson Bay Company's journals and a number of witnesses to these events stated that the united caravan was commonly known as a brigade.<ref name=\"Macdougall & St-Onge 2013\"/> These brigades did not just focus on buffalo hunting but were used by buffalo hunters to trade and freight during this time.<ref name=\" Macdougall & St-Onge 2013\"/> Women were fundamental in both actively participating in the brigade hunts or trade, as well as the bringing together of people prior to the excursion. By studying the social network of the Trottier Brigade, a community of people from the White Horse Plains in Red River, it is notable that biologically related women brought the majority of the men together.<ref name=\"Macdougall & St-Onge 2013\"/>\n\nThroughout the time that Metis people were a part of the Red River community they developed into several different identities, rather than just the common depiction of the bison-hunting French Catholic Metis. Metis identity, at that time as it is today, was diverse and complex due to the different livelihoods and practices followed.<ref name=\"St-Onge, Nicole J 1992\">{{cite journal |last1=St-Onge |first1=Nicole J.

Fishing and trading had become year round practices and the Metis families involved would trade with HBC and \u2018Freemen\u2019- traders that did not work at the post.<ref name=\"St-Onge, Nicole J 1992\"/>\n\nChristianity played a vital role in shaping the community within the colony, especially for the Metis people. In the early 19th century, considerations were made by the Committee in London to open schools run by the Clergymen to benefit, in their opinion, from instruction in religion and civilization.<ref name=\"Bradford, Tolly 1821\">Bradford, Tolly. \"Conservative Visions of Christianity and Community in Early Red River, c1800-1821.\" Manitoba History 71, no. 1 (2013): 36</ref> Although these schools took in all children of the colony, mixed-ancestry children were a large focus due to them being tied to the fur trading post by their European fathers.<ref name=\"Bradford, Tolly 1821\"/> John Halkett, a Committee member, wanted Metis families of retired HBC employees to be brought to Red River (from other nearby posts) to be put under the authority of the Roman Catholic Mission or Church Missionary Society.<ref name=\"Bradford, Tolly 1821\"/> This plan was largely related to keeping retired Metis employees from continuing trade with the Indigenous peoples; however, its effect led to Christianity being a prominent part of culture for the Metis community. The Chaplain of the Hudson Bay Company, [[John West (missionary)|John West]], was also interested in the religious educating of Metis children. According to his book, he wrote to the Governor submitting a plan to gather up a number of children to care for and educate. He stated that he created this plan when he saw these children being raised in a way he deemed ignorant and idle.<ref>West, John.

The ideal soil, climate and socio-economic potential of the area convinced Americans that they needed to make this land American territory.{{sfn|Warner|1953|}} The result ended up being an annexation proposal of Red River in 1870, in order to convert it into land that Americans could use for economic purposes. Due to the Red River Resistance, the American annexationists hoped to take advantage of the disruption caused by these political conflicts and present themselves in the forefront as the ideal leaders of the Red River land. The annexation was led by Minnesota senator Alexander Ramsey, and was backed by Zachariah Chandler and Jacob M. Howard- who were both senators of Michigan and represented Detroit merchants. They all shared the same economic vision for the annexation: Ramsey believed that the Red River valley would serve as an important commercial adjunct for his state, while Chandler and Howard believed that annexing the Red River would benefit their Great Lakes Trade.{{sfn|Warner|1953|}} These Americans hoped to colonise the land as their own, and tried to assert their dominance by destabilising the British efforts at colonization of the Red River and thus preventing the establishment of Canadian sovereignty in the area. A notable example would be James W. Taylor: he was an American special agent and Winnipeg consul who used his political power to shape the destiny of the valley, as well as attempting to remove the British influence on the valley.<ref>[[Grace Lee Nute|Nute, Grace Lee]]. \"New Light on Red River Valley History.\" Minnesota History Bulletin, Vol. 5, No. 8 (Nov., 1924), pg 568.</ref> \nThe Canadian government, however, did not allow these attempts at US expansionism to succeed.\n\nThe proposal was met with a lot of resistance from the Red River people as they were given the chance to address their grievances about the potential loss of land and becoming part of an American expansion and colonization through a proclamation by the Governor-General of the dominion. Americans who supported annexation by the US tried to depict themselves as favorable figures in the eyes of the M\u00e9tis by associating themselves with [[Louis Riel]]. The Resistance was an unarmed conflict started by the M\u00e9tis because Canada was attempting to claim possession of Rupert's Land without any concern for the grievances of the M\u00e9tis. However, the main American intention behind their decision to support Riel and the Resistance was an attempt to sway the M\u00e9tis in favour of the annexation by the US.{{sfn|Gluek|1955}} One of their tools was the New Nation newspaper which elicited rhetoric that advocated annexation by the US because it embodied the popular [[Manifest Destiny]] ideology. This was meant to help the cause of annexation, the idea being that their support of the Red River Resistance would encourage local resistance against Britain and Canada, and help swing local opinion in favour of independence \u2013 then ultimately America would step in to offer the protection of the United States government to the Red River M\u00e9tis and assert themselves as the new leaders and Red River would become American land.{{sfn|Gluek|1955}} They ultimately wanted to create a situation where the Red River could become American territory by allying with the discontented M\u00e9tis Nation.\n\nHowever, this aggressive propaganda ultimately backfired upon the proposal of annexation. It created even more hostility towards the annexation party, and the United States. This great emphasis on materialism never seemed appealing to the Red River people. The Americans became too acquisitive because they were eager to create a political union. This ultimately caused the annexation of the North West to fail, despite it being almost within reach.{{sfn|Gluek|1955}} All this ultimately benefited the Red River Resistance. As a result, the Metis were able to successfully defy Canadian expansion into Rupert's Land.<ref>Brown, Jennifer. \"M\u00e9tis, Halfbreeds, and Other Real People: Challenging Cultures and Categories\". The History Teacher. 27, 1. November 1993. Pg. 20.</ref>\n\nThis political chaos, in a sense, became pivotal for Red River because it allowed for the success of the M\u00e9tis in their rebellion. The Canadian government were forced to develop the negotiations that allowed for the M\u00e9tis demands were legally entrenched in the Manitoba Act that eventually led to the creation of province of Manitoba.<ref>Flanagan, Thomas. \"Louis Riel and the Dispersion of American Metis pg. 179\"</ref> The political disputes put the M\u00e9tis on a platform to voice their disapproval of Americans ignoring their concerns over these land disputes. They had legitimate claims to the land and they stated that they were the \"descendants of the lords of the soil.\".{{sfn|Ens|1994}} Also, under Louis Riel's leadership, the Metis rebels were able to capture [[Fort Garry]] \u2013 a fortified post of the Hudson's Bay Company. This would lead Riel into becoming the leader of the provisional government, and he composed and sent a list of rights to Ottawa.{{sfn|Bruyneel|2010}} The demands mainly consisted of the M\u00e9tis wanting Red River to be entered into the Canadian confederation as a province, security for their land claims, making English and French the official languages of the colony, as well as financial support for the Red River population.{{sfn|Bruyneel|2010}} Riel hoped to accomplish a sense of equality for the M\u00e9tis; he wanted to present them as a civilized people that were deserving of the same rights of any British subject.{{sfn|Ens|1994}} The rebellion became a pivotal moment in acquiring land rights and a political voice for the M\u00e9tis, who were constantly disregarded for their Aboriginal status.\n\nThe aftermath of the rebellion caused the M\u00e9tis to no longer be considered as Canadian Aboriginals \u2013 they became regarded as their own social group, and were distinct from other Aboriginal groups. In order to pacify the M\u00e9tis resistance further, the Canadian government gave them generous land grants in 1869\u201370 that was carefully structured to be given in severalty, rather than in common.<ref>Flanagan, Thomas. \"Louis Riel and the Dispersion of American Metis.\" Pg. 184</ref> Red River was now developing its own provincial government that had a political voice and political implications upon Canadian federal government. This rebellion also led to the M\u00e9tis emerging as a unique, acknowledged group within Canada, and ultimately, the disappearance of the Aboriginal rights paradigm in the public view of Red River.{{sfn|Ens|1994}} The rebellion was successful in a sense that it allowed the M\u00e9tis to have a political voice, but it impacted the perception of how other Aboriginals would be viewed in Red River.\n\nOnce the rebellion ended, Riel and several of his comrades fled to the United States in 1870 because British soldiers and colonial irregulars (often Scottish settlers) desired to exact revenge in reaction to several incidents, particularly the execution of [[Thomas Scott (Orangeman)|Thomas Scott]].{{sfn|Bruyneel|2010}} Riel, however later returned to Canada in 1885 to help lead the North West Rebellion. This caused him to face trial in a Canadian court, and eventually to being executed by the Canadian government in Regina. His death served as a political statement that outlined the relationship between French-English majorities and non-white minorities and what would happen if the latter chose to defy Canadian sovereignty.{{sfn|Bruyneel|2010}} The Canadian government was starting to punish the rebels for their defiance, but the rebellion is still considered a success in the sense that the Metis were still able to acquire the land rights they hoped to achieve, as well as no longer being ignored when it came to federal matters.\n\n==Development of Manitoba==\n{{main|Manitoba}}\nThe Red River rebellion needed to be finally be put to rest. In order to accomplish this, the Canadian government, which was predominantly led by English conservatives, initiated the ''Manitoba Act'' in 1870. They believed that this act would accomplish two purposes: this would be able to crush the rebellion, while at the same time, appeasing the French demands of increasing French influence in Canada because the act would create a Western province that was constitutionally supportive of French Canadian language and culture.{{sfn|Bruyneel|2010}} This was the first steps towards the creation of the present-day province of Manitoba. The ''Act'' was given royal assent on May 12, 1870, and the commencement of Manitoba with a provincial status came to fruition on July 15, 1870. After the passage of the ''Manitoba Act'', the M\u00e9tis Provisional government was disbanded.{{sfn|Bruyneel|2010}} There was an assimilation of the M\u00e9tis people and the English settlers, and the Aboriginal influence was further distanced from Red River.\n\nThrough the ''Act'', the Red River colony was now christened as Manitoba: a new Canadian province that was self-governed, and that had its own rights and responsibilities.{{sfn|Donnelly|1957}} It was no longer being viewed as a territory and was now officially part of the Canadian confederation. Provincial status was accelerated by [[Red River Rebellion|Louis Riel's rebellion]]. Riel wanted to secure Red River for the Canadians against the Americans' colonization projects and sentiments of their Manifest Destiny ideologies.{{sfn|Donnelly|1957}} The early Manitoba provincial government initially struggled to be effective. Everything around it felt rushed because the ''Manitoba Act'' was mostly created to prevent another Red River Rebellion. Many of the government officials were inexperienced \u2013 especially the three delegates who went to Ottawa to negotiate union terms. None of them had experience with diplomacy or the creation of new governments.{{sfn|Donnelly|1957}} Due to the hurried nature of the creation of this province, the officials of this new government presented themselves as overwhelmed and unprepared, and this shows that Manitoba was essentially created to re-stabilize political unrest within Canada.\n\nManitoba experienced conflicting interests between French and English Canadians. A quarter-century after the implementation of the ''Manitoba Act'', the province was considered to be the land of promise and key to Canada's future. Thousands of Ontarians were migrating to the prairies, but the French Canadians did not agree with the optimism behind the fertility of Manitoba's land, and they thought that the province was a threat to their national identity.<ref>Silver, AI. \"French Canada and the Prairie Frontier, 1870\u20131890\". University of Toronto Press, April 18, 2008. Pg. 27.</ref> Through such conflicts, Red River, now known as Manitoba, was experiencing a wave of settlers from all across Ontario, who would change and mold the identity of the colony. The Manitoba government also tried to ensure that the new province would continuously evolve into something prosperous by only allowing immigrants with special qualities{{sfn|Donnelly|1957}} since they wanted to immediately establish stable agricultural communities.\n\n== Governors of Red River ==\n[[File:Red River Colony.jpg|thumb|Governor of Red River, [[Andrew Bulger]], driving his family on the frozen [[Red River of the North|Red River]] in a horse [[cariole]] with [[Fort Garry]] in the background (1822\u201323)]]\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Term !!Governor\n|-\n|August 1812 \u2013 June 1815 ||[[Miles MacDonell]] \n|-\n|June 1815 \u2013 June 1816 ||[[Robert Semple (Canada)|Robert Semple]] \n|-\n|August 1816 \u2013 June 1822 ||[[Alexander Macdonell of Greenfield|Alexander Macdonnell]]\n|-\n|June 1822 \u2013 June 1823 ||[[Andrew Bulger]]\n|-\n|June 1823 \u2013 June 1825 ||[[Robert Parker Pelly]]\n|-\n|June 1825 \u2013 June 1833 ||[[Donald Mackenzie (explorer)|Donald McKenzie]]\n|-\n|June 1833 \u2013 June 1839 ||[[Alexander Christie (governor)|Alexander Christie]]\n|-\n|June 1839 \u2013 June 1844 ||[[Duncan Finlayson (governor of Assiniboia)|Duncan Finlayson]]\n|-\n|June 1844 \u2013 June 1846 ||[[Alexander Christie (governor)|Alexander Christie]]\n|-\n|June 1846 \u2013 June 1847 ||[[John Folliott Crofton]]\n|-\n|June 1847 \u2013 June 1848 ||[[John T.

The fur trade proper is merely a selected moment of time from a fuller spectrum of exchange that was embedded in particular social relations.<ref name=\":4\">{{cite journal |last1=Kirk |first1=Sylvia Van |title=The Role of Native Women in the Fur Trade Society of Western Canada, 1670-1830 |journal=Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies |date=1984 |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=9\u201313 |doi=10.2307/3346234 |jstor=3346234 }}</ref>\n\nThe fur trade was based on a complex set of relationships between two very different groups who held jagged worldviews. Various women belonging to the tribes of Ojibway, the Cree, and Chipewayan who were part of forming this relationship created a unique situation for Indigenous women. They became women who could walk between both distinct worlds. They became women who provided leadership in these spaces. They became an integral part of their culture economically as they used their femininity to operate under settler patriarchal law and took part in the fur trade. These women acted as allies of the whites and in certain circumstances permitted individual women to gain positions as an influence within settler society and act as social brokers between the two groups. Indigenous women took up their responsibilities and became active agents in the development of Indigenous and settler relations with the thought of their cultures survival and generations ahead in their heart.<ref name=\":6\">{{cite journal |last1=Van Kirk |first1=Sylvia |title='Women in Between': Indian Women in Fur Trade Society in Western Canada |journal=Historical Papers |date=20 April 2006 |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=30\u201346 |doi=10.7202/030819ar |doi-access=free }}</ref>  \u00a0\n\nTo the First Nations women these marital alliances created a reciprocal bond which formed economical relationships with traders for their communities. Adopting settlers into their kinship circle confirmed the expected equitable privileges such as free access to posts and provisions. Although it is evident that settlers did not understand the depth of these relationships and would often violate previous negotiations as well as their marital wives. It is important to recognize how the lives of many walking in these opposing two worlds was unsparing. Indigenous women involved in these relationships were often abused by their settler spouses.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nFirst Nation women came from a society that was organized to maintain the balance between men and women. In regard to marital relationships, women had the authority to institute a divorce if her marriage proved unsatisfactory. Within the fur trade society, traders would often place their wives with another man in the practice known as \u201cturning off\u201d in an attempt to provide a temporary \u201cprotector\u201d due to long separations between. Many women tried to resist but there was little that could be done as marriage under common law, in the New World, robbed women of their rights and created conditions for men to act tyrannically.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Sisters in Spirit: Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) Influence on Early American Feminists|last=Roesch Wagner|first=Sally|publisher=Native Voices Books|year=2001|isbn=|location=|pages=}}{{pn|date=December 2019}}</ref> \n\nThese laws arose with the formation of the government for the new world. The men reverted to England for their new model. The European tradition of the Catholic Church placed women in the role of property. British laws are traditionally based on the all sufficiently of man rights, and society operating under this form of patriarchy exist for women only if she is a man\u2019s object for keeping. A woman\u2019s very being or legal existence, Indigenous or non-Indigenous, was upended during marriage or consolidated into that of the husband under who she performs everything <ref name=\":2\" />. \n\nBy the end of the eighteenth century fur traders had built a nefarious trafficking of First Nations Women. Fur traders would often seize women by force for the reimbursement of trade debts, and then sold them to other settler men for large sums of money. In one instance, the Chipewyan began leaving their women behind when they came to trade. In 1792, when Hudson\u2019s Bay traders appeared on Lake Athabasca, the Chipewyan hoped to secure their support and drive out their rivals, the North-Western Company who had continuously assaulted the fathers and husbands for trying to release their women. The Chipewyan were eventually able to release their women during the summer months while the fur traders were away. Many First Nations women were welcomed back into their communities after their treatment by the whites as unwilling objects of transaction. Reinforced with experience, whites were no longer seen as a desirable husband.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nWith the broken relationship between fur traders and First Nations with the outright abuse of First Nations women along with the fact that marriage alliances were no longer a significant factor in trade relations from the settler perspective, led to a decline in \u201cthe practice of fur traders taking an Indian wife\u201d. One of the significant factors which changed the trader\u2019s attitude towards First Nations women was that they were no longer seen as an object that could walk in between two worlds for their economic gain. By the turn of the century, a group of mixed-blood women, metis, had emerged as a product of these previous relationships. In this context, metis women were created as a tool to perpetuate the social and economic agenda of the settler state. Fur traders now preferred metis women as their object of choice. In this way, First Nations women were replaced in fur trade society by metis women.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n== The Metis People of the Red River Colony ==\nThe mixed ethnicity of Indigenous and European peoples at the Red River Colony, known as Metis, were not always referred to by that name in the beginning years of their existence. [[Augustus Chetlain]], an author who lived in the colony, wrote in his book that they were often called \"Brules, Metifs, or half-breeds, the bastard sons of Indian concubines\".<ref>Chetlain, Augustus L. The Red River Colony. New York: New York, 1878: 50</ref>\n\nThe culture and lifestyle of the Metis community living in Red River were not only present at the colony. Metis people had a long-lasting tradition of a semi-annual, commercial, buffalo hunt that took place throughout the prairies starting in the mid-1700s with the western fur trade.<ref name=\"Macdougall & St-Onge 2013\">{{cite journal |last1=Macdougall |first1=Brenda |last2=St-Onge |first2=Nicole |title=Rooted in Mobility: Metis Buffalo-Hunting Brigades |journal=Manitoba History |volume=71 |issue=1 |year=2013 |pages=21\u201332 |url=https://search.proquest.com/openview/b687a93b0ad718b885305ad2860b28f9/1 }}</ref> The Hudson Bay Company's journals and a number of witnesses to these events stated that the united caravan was commonly known as a brigade.<ref name=\"Macdougall & St-Onge 2013\"/> These brigades did not just focus on buffalo hunting but were used by buffalo hunters to trade and freight during this time.<ref name=\" Macdougall & St-Onge 2013\"/> Women were fundamental in both actively participating in the brigade hunts or trade, as well as the bringing together of people prior to the excursion. By studying the social network of the Trottier Brigade, a community of people from the White Horse Plains in Red River, it is notable that biologically related women brought the majority of the men together.<ref name=\"Macdougall & St-Onge 2013\"/>\n\nThroughout the time that Metis people were a part of the Red River community they developed into several different identities, rather than just the common depiction of the bison-hunting French Catholic Metis.

In the early 19th century, considerations were made by the Committee in London to open schools run by the Clergymen to benefit, in their opinion, from instruction in religion and civilization.<ref name=\"Bradford, Tolly 1821\">Bradford, Tolly. \"Conservative Visions of Christianity and Community in Early Red River, c1800-1821.\" Manitoba History 71, no. 1 (2013): 36</ref> Although these schools took in all children of the colony, mixed-ancestry children were a large focus due to them being tied to the fur trading post by their European fathers.<ref name=\"Bradford, Tolly 1821\"/> John Halkett, a Committee member, wanted Metis families of retired HBC employees to be brought to Red River (from other nearby posts) to be put under the authority of the Roman Catholic Mission or Church Missionary Society.<ref name=\"Bradford, Tolly 1821\"/> This plan was largely related to keeping retired Metis employees from continuing trade with the Indigenous peoples; however, its effect led to Christianity being a prominent part of culture for the Metis community.

According to his book, he wrote to the Governor submitting a plan to gather up a number of children to care for and educate.

The ideal soil, climate and socio-economic potential of the area convinced Americans that they needed to make this land American territory.{{sfn|Warner|1953|}} The result ended up being an annexation proposal of Red River in 1870, in order to convert it into land that Americans could use for economic purposes. Due to the Red River Resistance, the American annexationists hoped to take advantage of the disruption caused by these political conflicts and present themselves in the forefront as the ideal leaders of the Red River land. The annexation was led by Minnesota senator Alexander Ramsey, and was backed by Zachariah Chandler and Jacob M. Howard- who were both senators of Michigan and represented Detroit merchants. They all shared the same economic vision for the annexation: Ramsey believed that the Red River valley would serve as an important commercial adjunct for his state, while Chandler and Howard believed that annexing the Red River would benefit their Great Lakes Trade.{{sfn|Warner|1953|}} These Americans hoped to colonise the land as their own, and tried to assert their dominance by destabilising the British efforts at colonization of the Red River and thus preventing the establishment of Canadian sovereignty in the area. A notable example would be James W. Taylor: he was an American special agent and Winnipeg consul who used his political power to shape the destiny of the valley, as well as attempting to remove the British influence on the valley.<ref>[[Grace Lee Nute|Nute, Grace Lee]]. \"New Light on Red River Valley History.\" Minnesota History Bulletin, Vol. 5, No. 8 (Nov., 1924), pg 568.</ref> \nThe Canadian government, however, did not allow these attempts at US expansionism to succeed.\n\nThe proposal was met with a lot of resistance from the Red River people as they were given the chance to address their grievances about the potential loss of land and becoming part of an American expansion and colonization through a proclamation by the Governor-General of the dominion. Americans who supported annexation by the US tried to depict themselves as favorable figures in the eyes of the M\u00e9tis by associating themselves with [[Louis Riel]]. The Resistance was an unarmed conflict started by the M\u00e9tis because Canada was attempting to claim possession of Rupert's Land without any concern for the grievances of the M\u00e9tis. However, the main American intention behind their decision to support Riel and the Resistance was an attempt to sway the M\u00e9tis in favour of the annexation by the US.{{sfn|Gluek|1955}} One of their tools was the New Nation newspaper which elicited rhetoric that advocated annexation by the US because it embodied the popular [[Manifest Destiny]] ideology. This was meant to help the cause of annexation, the idea being that their support of the Red River Resistance would encourage local resistance against Britain and Canada, and help swing local opinion in favour of independence \u2013 then ultimately America would step in to offer the protection of the United States government to the Red River M\u00e9tis and assert themselves as the new leaders and Red River would become American land.{{sfn|Gluek|1955}} They ultimately wanted to create a situation where the Red River could become American territory by allying with the discontented M\u00e9tis Nation.\n\nHowever, this aggressive propaganda ultimately backfired upon the proposal of annexation. It created even more hostility towards the annexation party, and the United States. This great emphasis on materialism never seemed appealing to the Red River people. The Americans became too acquisitive because they were eager to create a political union. This ultimately caused the annexation of the North West to fail, despite it being almost within reach.{{sfn|Gluek|1955}} All this ultimately benefited the Red River Resistance. As a result, the Metis were able to successfully defy Canadian expansion into Rupert's Land.<ref>Brown, Jennifer. \"M\u00e9tis, Halfbreeds, and Other Real People: Challenging Cultures and Categories\". The History Teacher. 27, 1. November 1993. Pg. 20.</ref>\n\nThis political chaos, in a sense, became pivotal for Red River because it allowed for the success of the M\u00e9tis in their rebellion. The Canadian government were forced to develop the negotiations that allowed for the M\u00e9tis demands were legally entrenched in the Manitoba Act that eventually led to the creation of province of Manitoba.<ref>Flanagan, Thomas. \"Louis Riel and the Dispersion of American Metis pg. 179\"</ref> The political disputes put the M\u00e9tis on a platform to voice their disapproval of Americans ignoring their concerns over these land disputes. They had legitimate claims to the land and they stated that they were the \"descendants of the lords of the soil.\".{{sfn|Ens|1994}} Also, under Louis Riel's leadership, the Metis rebels were able to capture [[Fort Garry]] \u2013 a fortified post of the Hudson's Bay Company. This would lead Riel into becoming the leader of the provisional government, and he composed and sent a list of rights to Ottawa.{{sfn|Bruyneel|2010}} The demands mainly consisted of the M\u00e9tis wanting Red River to be entered into the Canadian confederation as a province, security for their land claims, making English and French the official languages of the colony, as well as financial support for the Red River population.{{sfn|Bruyneel|2010}} Riel hoped to accomplish a sense of equality for the M\u00e9tis; he wanted to present them as a civilized people that were deserving of the same rights of any British subject.{{sfn|Ens|1994}} The rebellion became a pivotal moment in acquiring land rights and a political voice for the M\u00e9tis, who were constantly disregarded for their Aboriginal status.\n\nThe aftermath of the rebellion caused the M\u00e9tis to no longer be considered as Canadian Aboriginals \u2013 they became regarded as their own social group, and were distinct from other Aboriginal groups. In order to pacify the M\u00e9tis resistance further, the Canadian government gave them generous land grants in 1869\u201370 that was carefully structured to be given in severalty, rather than in common.<ref>Flanagan, Thomas. \"Louis Riel and the Dispersion of American Metis.\" Pg. 184</ref> Red River was now developing its own provincial government that had a political voice and political implications upon Canadian federal government. This rebellion also led to the M\u00e9tis emerging as a unique, acknowledged group within Canada, and ultimately, the disappearance of the Aboriginal rights paradigm in the public view of Red River.{{sfn|Ens|1994}} The rebellion was successful in a sense that it allowed the M\u00e9tis to have a political voice, but it impacted the perception of how other Aboriginals would be viewed in Red River.\n\nOnce the rebellion ended, Riel and several of his comrades fled to the United States in 1870 because British soldiers and colonial irregulars (often Scottish settlers) desired to exact revenge in reaction to several incidents, particularly the execution of [[Thomas Scott (Orangeman)|Thomas Scott]].{{sfn|Bruyneel|2010}} Riel, however later returned to Canada in 1885 to help lead the North West Rebellion. This caused him to face trial in a Canadian court, and eventually to being executed by the Canadian government in Regina. His death served as a political statement that outlined the relationship between French-English majorities and non-white minorities and what would happen if the latter chose to defy Canadian sovereignty.{{sfn|Bruyneel|2010}} The Canadian government was starting to punish the rebels for their defiance, but the rebellion is still considered a success in the sense that the Metis were still able to acquire the land rights they hoped to achieve, as well as no longer being ignored when it came to federal matters.\n\n==Development of Manitoba==\n{{main|Manitoba}}\nThe Red River rebellion needed to be finally be put to rest. In order to accomplish this, the Canadian government, which was predominantly led by English conservatives, initiated the ''Manitoba Act'' in 1870. They believed that this act would accomplish two purposes: this would be able to crush the rebellion, while at the same time, appeasing the French demands of increasing French influence in Canada because the act would create a Western province that was constitutionally supportive of French Canadian language and culture.{{sfn|Bruyneel|2010}} This was the first steps towards the creation of the present-day province of Manitoba. The ''Act'' was given royal assent on May 12, 1870, and the commencement of Manitoba with a provincial status came to fruition on July 15, 1870. After the passage of the ''Manitoba Act'', the M\u00e9tis Provisional government was disbanded.{{sfn|Bruyneel|2010}} There was an assimilation of the M\u00e9tis people and the English settlers, and the Aboriginal influence was further distanced from Red River.\n\nThrough the ''Act'', the Red River colony was now christened as Manitoba: a new Canadian province that was self-governed, and that had its own rights and responsibilities.{{sfn|Donnelly|1957}} It was no longer being viewed as a territory and was now officially part of the Canadian confederation. Provincial status was accelerated by [[Red River Rebellion|Louis Riel's rebellion]]. Riel wanted to secure Red River for the Canadians against the Americans' colonization projects and sentiments of their Manifest Destiny ideologies.{{sfn|Donnelly|1957}} The early Manitoba provincial government initially struggled to be effective. Everything around it felt rushed because the ''Manitoba Act'' was mostly created to prevent another Red River Rebellion. Many of the government officials were inexperienced \u2013 especially the three delegates who went to Ottawa to negotiate union terms. None of them had experience with diplomacy or the creation of new governments.{{sfn|Donnelly|1957}} Due to the hurried nature of the creation of this province, the officials of this new government presented themselves as overwhelmed and unprepared, and this shows that Manitoba was essentially created to re-stabilize political unrest within Canada.\n\nManitoba experienced conflicting interests between French and English Canadians. A quarter-century after the implementation of the ''Manitoba Act'', the province was considered to be the land of promise and key to Canada's future. Thousands of Ontarians were migrating to the prairies, but the French Canadians did not agree with the optimism behind the fertility of Manitoba's land, and they thought that the province was a threat to their national identity.<ref>Silver, AI. \"French Canada and the Prairie Frontier, 1870\u20131890\". University of Toronto Press, April 18, 2008. Pg. 27.</ref> Through such conflicts, Red River, now known as Manitoba, was experiencing a wave of settlers from all across Ontario, who would change and mold the identity of the colony. The Manitoba government also tried to ensure that the new province would continuously evolve into something prosperous by only allowing immigrants with special qualities{{sfn|Donnelly|1957}} since they wanted to immediately establish stable agricultural communities.\n\n== Governors of Red River ==\n[[File:Red River Colony.jpg|thumb|Governor of Red River, [[Andrew Bulger]], driving his family on the frozen [[Red River of the North|Red River]] in a horse [[cariole]] with [[Fort Garry]] in the background (1822\u201323)]]\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Term !!Governor\n|-\n|August 1812 \u2013 June 1815 ||[[Miles MacDonell]] \n|-\n|June 1815 \u2013 June 1816 ||[[Robert Semple (Canada)|Robert Semple]] \n|-\n|August 1816 \u2013 June 1822 ||[[Alexander Macdonell of Greenfield|Alexander Macdonnell]]\n|-\n|June 1822 \u2013 June 1823 ||[[Andrew Bulger]]\n|-\n|June 1823 \u2013 June 1825 ||[[Robert Parker Pelly]]\n|-\n|June 1825 \u2013 June 1833 ||[[Donald Mackenzie (explorer)|Donald McKenzie]]\n|-\n|June 1833 \u2013 June 1839 ||[[Alexander Christie (governor)|Alexander Christie]]\n|-\n|June 1839 \u2013 June 1844 ||[[Duncan Finlayson (governor of Assiniboia)|Duncan Finlayson]]\n|-\n|June 1844 \u2013 June 1846 ||[[Alexander Christie (governor)|Alexander Christie]]\n|-\n|June 1846 \u2013 June 1847 ||[[John Folliott Crofton]]\n|-\n|June 1847 \u2013 June 1848 ||[[John T.

{"title_page": "Road signs in New Zealand", "text_new": "'''Road signs in New Zealand''' are similar to those set by the [[Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals]]. While New Zealand is not a signatory to the convention, its [[road sign]]s are generally close in shape and function. New Zealand uses yellow diamond-shaped signs for warnings in common with [[Australia]], the Americas, [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Japan]] and [[Thailand]]. Speed limit signs are a red circle with a white background and the limitation in black, and are in kilometres per hour. There are also some signs unique to New Zealand. Road signs in New Zealand are controlled by the [[NZ Transport Agency]] and are prescribed in the Land Transport Rule: Traffic Control Devices 2004 and set out in the ''Traffic Control Devices (TCD) Manual''.<ref name=\"New Zealand Transport Agency\">{{cite book | url=http://www.nzta.govt.nz/resources/traffic-control-devices-manual/sign-specifications/ | title=Traffic Control Devices Manual | publisher=New Zealand Transport Agency | accessdate=2012-07-15 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nMost of these signs were only introduced in 1987, replacing older-style signs with white text on black backgrounds - square with a red border for regulatory signs and diamond with a yellow border. The only signs that remained the same were the Stop sign and the speed limit sign (although the \"km/h\" legend from metrication was removed). Some of these signs can still be seen on some rural roads.\n\nNew Zealand [[Right- and left-hand traffic|drives on the left]].\n\n==Regulatory==\nSpeed limits are posted in multiples of {{convert|10|km/h|mph|1|abbr=~}}, and range from {{convert|10|-|110|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}, with 110&nbsp;km/h being the maximum legal speed for motor vehicles in New Zealand. The ''Manual of Traffic Signs and Markings'' specifies that [[#Permanent Warning|advisory speed]]s (PW-25) always end in digit \"5\", however there are some advisory speed signs that do not comply with the ''Manual'' and end in zero.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Charlton |first1=S.G. |last2=de Pont |first2=J.J. |title=Curve Speed Management |url=

[[Linearity|linear]] location referencing system for its State Highway network, nationwide.<ref>https://www.nzta.govt.nz/assets/resources/location-ref-management-sys-manual/docs/SM051-part-b.pdf New Zealand Transport Agency LRMS Manual SM051 Retrieved 18-03-2019</ref> This assists roading contractors, safety auditors and emergency services in pin-pointing locations across the country. The LRMS features several types of signs and methods of reference. All KMP's are installed using a calibrated [[Odometer#Trip_meters|Trip Meter]] from the beginning of the road. ERP's however, are placed using land surveying equipment.\n\nAll LRMS signs are installed on the 'true left' side of the lane or carriageway, this is determined by the left hand side when facing the increasing direction, The increasing direction of travel is the direction in which positive measurements are made. Divided carriageways (roads with concrete berms or centrelines) have an Increasing (I) side and a Decreasing (D) side. This can be seen on LRMS signs in these areas.\n\n===Established Route Position (ERP)===\nEstablished Route Position signs are used to highlight a special location or bearing on the highway, These are placed routinely along the carriageways, usually every 3km. They feature the current Reference Station and the number of kilometres from the beginning of that Reference Station. These are required by the NZTA to have an accuracy of less than 3 metres. ERP signs are double-sided and feature a reflective green strip. They also have a small yellow triangle on the post pointing in the roads increasing direction.\n\n===Kilometre Marker Post (KMP)===\nKilometre Marker Post signs are used to highlight the progression along the highway, These are placed routinely along the carriageways, every 1000 metres. They feature the State Highway Shield, the current Reference Station and the number of kilometres from the beginning of that Reference Station. These are required by the NZTA to have an accuracy of less than 100 metres. KMP signs are on plastic, flexible posts. They are double-sided and feature a reflective black strip.\n\n===Reference Station (RS)===\nReference Station signs are placed at the change of a Reference Station, or beginning of a Highway. KMP and ERP signs are reset to zero at the beginning of each RS.\n<gallery>\nFile:Established Route Point Sign.jpg|'''ERP Sign''' (SH1, Route Station 594, 3km)\nFile:Kilometre Marker Post Sign.jpg|'''KMP Sign''' (SH1, Route Station 594, 1km)\nFile:Route Station Marker Sign.jpg|'''RS Sign''' (SH1, Route Station 591)\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Speed limits in New Zealand]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Traffic signs}}\n\n[[Category:Road transport in New Zealand]]\n[[Category:Road signs by country|New Zealand]]\n", "text_old": "'''Road signs in New Zealand''' are similar to those set by the [[Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals]]. While New Zealand is not a signatory to the convention, its [[road sign]]s are generally close in shape and function. New Zealand uses yellow diamond-shaped signs for warnings in common with [[Australia]], the Americas, [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Japan]] and [[Thailand]]. Speed limit signs are a red circle with a white background and the limitation in black, and are in kilometres per hour. There are also some signs unique to New Zealand. Road signs in New Zealand are controlled by the [[NZ Transport Agency]] and are prescribed in the Land Transport Rule: Traffic Control Devices 2004 and set out in the ''Traffic Control Devices (TCD) Manual''.<ref name=\"New Zealand Transport Agency\">{{cite book | url=http://www.nzta.govt.nz/resources/traffic-control-devices-manual/sign-specifications/ | title=Traffic Control Devices Manual | publisher=New Zealand Transport Agency | accessdate=2012-07-15 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nMost of these signs were only introduced in 1987, replacing older-style signs with white text on black backgrounds - square with a red border for regulatory signs and diamond with a yellow border. The only signs that remained the same were the Stop sign and the speed limit sign (although the \"km/h\" legend from metrication was removed). Some of these signs can still be seen on some rural roads.\n\nNew Zealand [[Right- and left-hand traffic|drives on the left]].\n\n==Regulatory==\nSpeed limits are posted in multiples of {{convert|10|km/h|mph|1|abbr=~}}, and range from {{convert|10|-|110|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}, with 110&nbsp;km/h being the maximum legal speed for motor vehicles in New Zealand. The ''Manual of Traffic Signs and Markings'' specifies that [[#Permanent Warning|advisory speed]]s (PW-25) always end in digit \"5\", however there are some advisory speed signs that do not comply with the ''Manual'' and end in zero.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Charlton |first1=S.G. |last2=de Pont |first2=J.J. |title=Curve Speed Management |url=

[[Linearity|linear]] location referencing system for its State Highway network, nationwide.<ref>https://www.nzta.govt.nz/assets/resources/location-ref-management-sys-manual/docs/SM051-part-b.pdf New Zealand Transport Agency LRMS Manual SM051 Retrieved 18-03-2019</ref> This assists roading contractors, safety auditors and emergency services in pin-pointing locations across the country. The LRMS features several types of signs and methods of reference. All KMP's are installed using a calibrated [[Odometer#Trip_meters|Trip Meter]] from the beginning of the road. ERP's however, are placed using land surveying equipment.\n\nAll LRMS signs are installed on the 'true left' side of the lane or carriageway, this is determined by the left hand side when facing the increasing direction, The increasing direction of travel is the direction in which positive measurements are made. Divided carriageways (roads with concrete berms or centrelines) have an Increasing (I) side and a Decreasing (D) side. This can be seen on LRMS signs in these areas.\n\n===Established Route Position (ERP)===\nEstablished Route Position signs are used to highlight a special location or bearing on the highway, These are placed routinely along the carriageways, usually every 3km. They feature the current Reference Station and the number of kilometres from the beginning of that Reference Station. These are required by the NZTA to have an accuracy of less than 3 metres. ERP signs are double-sided and feature a reflective green strip. They also have a small yellow triangle on the post pointing in the roads increasing direction.\n\n===Kilometre Marker Post (KMP)===\nKilometre Marker Post signs are used to highlight the progression along the highway, These are placed routinely along the carriageways, every 1000 metres. They feature the State Highway Shield, the current Reference Station and the number of kilometres from the beginning of that Reference Station. These are required by the NZTA to have an accuracy of less than 100 metres. KMP signs are on plastic, flexible posts. They are double-sided and feature a reflective black strip.\n\n===Reference Station (RS)===\nReference Station signs are placed at the change of a Reference Station, or beginning of a Highway. KMP and ERP signs are reset to zero at the beginning of each RS.\n<gallery>\nFile:Established Route Point Sign.jpg|'''ERP Sign''' (SH1, Route Station 594, 3km)\nFile:Kilometre Marker Post Sign.jpg|'''KMP Sign''' (SH1, Route Station 594, 1km)\nFile:Route Station Marker Sign.jpg|'''RS Sign''' (SH1, Route Station 591)\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Speed limits in New Zealand]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Traffic signs}}\n\n[[Category:Road transport in New Zealand]]\n[[Category:Road signs by country|New Zealand]]\n", "name_user": "Fry1989", "label": "safe", "comment": "(GR)File renamed:File:New Zealand RG-35.svg\u2192File:New Zealand road sign R4-7.svgFile name standardisation.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_signs_in_New_Zealand"}
