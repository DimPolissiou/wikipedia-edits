It portrays the life of Hatid\u017ee Muratova, a wild [[beekeeper]] in the remote mountainous village of Bekirlija, [[North Macedonia]], and follows her lifestyle before and after neighbors move in next door. Although initially planned as a short film documenting the region surrounding the river [[Bregalnica]], the documentary's area of focus changed course when directors met Hatid\u017ee. ''Honeyland'' received its world premiere at the [[2019 Sundance Film Festival]] on 28 January and it has grossed $1,140,879.\n\nFilming of ''Honeyland'' lasted for three years, with directors collecting a total of four hundred hours of footage. Several [[environmentalism|environmental topics]] are explored, such as [[climate change]], [[biodiversity loss]], and [[exploitation of natural resources]]. Primarily focusing on the visual aspects, the directors wanted to portray humanity's balance with the [[ecosystem]] through Hatid\u017ee and [[consumerism]] and [[resource depletion]] through her neighbours. The documentary also portrays the protagonist's relationship with her bedridden mother and her neighbors. ''Honeyland'' contains elements of several documentary styles, including [[fly on the wall]], [[direct cinema]], and [[cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9]]. \n\n''Honeyland'' received universal critical acclaim from film critics who praised attention to detail and applauded the promotion of conservation of nature. The documentary received numerous awards and nominations at film festivals, including three awards at the [[2019 Sundance Film Festival]] and two nominations at the [[92nd Academy Awards]] in the categories for [[Academy Award for Best International Feature Film|Best International Feature Film]] and [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature|Best Documentary Feature]]. ''Honeyland'' marked the first documentary in history to receive a nomination in both categories in the history of the Oscars.\n\n==Plot==\n''Honeyland'' documents the life of Hatid\u017ee Muratova, a Macedonian wild [[beekeeping|beekeeper]] of [[Turks in North Macedonia|Turkish]] descent who lives in the village of Bekirlija in the [[Lozovo Municipality|municipality of Lozovo]]. She is one of the last remaining wild beekeepers in [[North Macedonia]] and [[Europe]]. Due to its location in a secluded mountain, the village has no access to electricity or running water. Hatid\u017ee lives with her 85-year-old partly blind bedridden mother, Nazife, who is completely dependent on her daughter. She earns a living by selling honey in the country's capital [[Skopje]] which is four hours away from the village. \n\nChanges in the village are brought upon by the arrival of the nomadic rancher Hussein Sam, who arrives with a trailer along with his wife Ljutvie, their seven children and their imported domestic animals.<ref name=\"THR\">{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/oscars-2020-north-macedonia-selects-honeyland-best-international-feature-category-1234863|title=Oscars: North Macedonia Selects 'Honeyland' for Best International Feature Category|last=Holdsworth|first=Nick|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=27 August 2019|accessdate=27 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://filmmakermagazine.com/106712-living-and-working-with-each-other-for-those-three-years-in-almost-unbearable-life-conditions-directors-ljubo-stefanov-and-tamara-kotevska-honeyland/|title=\"Living and Working with Each Other for Those Three Years in Almost Unbearable Life Conditions\": Directors Ljubo Stefanov and Tamara Kotevska {{!}} Honeyland|website=Filmmaker|date=28 January 2019|access-date=5 January 2020}}</ref> Initially, Hatid\u017ee maintains good relationships with the family and bonds with the children who frequently invade her privacy. In need of financial means, and inspired by Hatid\u017ee's way of earning money, Sam takes an interest in wild beekeeping himself. Hatid\u017ee instructs him on collecting honey and provides him with several bees so Sam can start his own colony. Despite being initially successful at beekeeping, Sam receives a demand by a customer to provide him with more honey than his bees can produce. Sam disregards Hatid\u017ee's advice of always leaving half of the honey to the bee and proceeds to sell the entire honey his beehives produce. This leads to Sam's colonies attacking Hatid\u017ee's during the resource-scarce winter period, thus bringing an end to her trade. Hatid\u017ee scolds Sam for not following her advice as she finds her bee colony collapsing. Soon after, her mother passes away. As the nomadic family decides to move on to the next village, Hatid\u017ee remains alone in Bekirlija.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.inverse.com/article/62254-honeyland-documentary-science-golden-rule|title=Oscar-nominated doc 'Honeyland' teaches a golden rule, rooted in science|work=Inverse.com|first=Sarah|last=Slota|date=13 January 2020|accessdate=19 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Conception and development==\n[[File:Bregalnica River.JPG|thumb|left|The film was originally planned as a documentary short about preserving the region surrounding river [[Bregalnica]] (''pictured'').]]\n''Honeyland'' marks [[Tamara Kotevska]]'s and [[Ljubomir Stefanov]]'s second collaboration on a documentary movie after ''Lake of Apples'' (2017).<ref>{{cite news |last1=Eagan |first1=Daniel |title='It's a Choice: To Be a Filmmaker or a Human': Ljubomir Stefanov and Tamara Kotevska on Honeyland |url=https://filmmakermagazine.com/107983-its-a-choice-to-be-a-filmmaker-or-a-human-ljubomir-stefanov-and-tamara-kotevska-on-honeyland/#.XhyTzFNKgWo |accessdate=13 January 2020 |work=[[Filmmaker (magazine)|Filmmaker]] |date=22 August 2019}}</ref> The movie was originally intended as [[documentary short]] financially supported by the government.

It portrays the life of Hatid\u017ee Muratova, a wild [[beekeeper]] in the remote mountainous village of Bekirlija, [[North Macedonia]], and follows her lifestyle before and after neighbors move in next door. Although initially planned as a short film documenting the region surrounding the river [[Bregalnica]], the documentary's area of focus changed course when directors met Hatid\u017ee. ''Honeyland'' received its world premiere at the [[2019 Sundance Film Festival]] on 28 January and it has grossed $1,140,879.\n\nFilming of ''Honeyland'' lasted for three years, with directors collecting a total of four hundred hours of footage. Several [[environmentalism|environmental topics]] are explored, such as [[climate change]], [[biodiversity loss]], and [[exploitation of natural resources]]. Primarily focusing on the visual aspects, the directors wanted to portray humanity's balance with the [[ecosystem]] through Hatid\u017ee and [[consumerism]] and [[resource depletion]] through her neighbours. The documentary also portrays the protagonist's relationship with her bedridden mother and her neighbors. ''Honeyland'' contains elements of several documentary styles, including [[fly on the wall]], [[direct cinema]], and [[cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9]]. \n\n''Honeyland'' received universal critical acclaim from film critics who praised attention to detail and applauded the promotion of conservation of nature. The documentary received numerous awards and nominations at film festivals, including three awards at the [[2019 Sundance Film Festival]] and two nominations at the [[92nd Academy Awards]] in the categories for [[Academy Award for Best International Feature Film|Best International Feature Film]] and [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature|Best Documentary Feature]]. ''Honeyland'' marked the first documentary in history to receive a nomination in both categories in the history of the Oscars.\n\n==Plot==\n''Honeyland'' documents the life of Hatid\u017ee Muratova, a Macedonian wild [[beekeeping|beekeeper]] of [[Turks in North Macedonia|Turkish]] descent who lives in the village of Bekirlija in the [[Lozovo Municipality|municipality of Lozovo]]. She is one of the last remaining wild beekeepers in [[North Macedonia]] and [[Europe]]. Due to its location in a secluded mountain, the village has no access to electricity or running water. Hatid\u017ee lives with her 85-year-old partly blind bedridden mother, Nazife, who is completely dependent on her daughter. She earns a living by selling honey in the country's capital [[Skopje]] which is four hours away from the village. \n\nChanges in the village are brought upon by the arrival of the nomadic rancher Hussein Sam, who arrives with a trailer along with his wife Ljutvie, their seven children and their imported domestic animals.<ref name=\"THR\">{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/oscars-2020-north-macedonia-selects-honeyland-best-international-feature-category-1234863|title=Oscars: North Macedonia Selects 'Honeyland' for Best International Feature Category|last=Holdsworth|first=Nick|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=27 August 2019|accessdate=27 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://filmmakermagazine.com/106712-living-and-working-with-each-other-for-those-three-years-in-almost-unbearable-life-conditions-directors-ljubo-stefanov-and-tamara-kotevska-honeyland/|title=\"Living and Working with Each Other for Those Three Years in Almost Unbearable Life Conditions\": Directors Ljubo Stefanov and Tamara Kotevska {{!}} Honeyland|website=Filmmaker|date=28 January 2019|access-date=5 January 2020}}</ref> Initially, Hatid\u017ee maintains good relationships with the family and bonds with the children who frequently invade her privacy. In need of financial means, and inspired by Hatid\u017ee's way of earning money, Sam takes an interest in wild beekeeping himself. Hatid\u017ee instructs him on collecting honey and provides him with several bees so Sam can start his own colony. Despite being initially successful at beekeeping, Sam receives a demand by a customer to provide him with more honey than his bees can produce. Sam disregards Hatid\u017ee's advice of always leaving half of the honey to the bee and proceeds to sell the entire honey his beehives produce. This leads to Sam's colonies attacking Hatid\u017ee's during the resource-scarce winter period, thus bringing an end to her trade. Hatid\u017ee scolds Sam for not following her advice as she finds her bee colony collapsing. Soon after, her mother passes away. As the nomadic family decides to move on to the next village, Hatid\u017ee remains alone in Bekirlija.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.inverse.com/article/62254-honeyland-documentary-science-golden-rule|title=Oscar-nominated doc 'Honeyland' teaches a golden rule, rooted in science|work=Inverse.com|first=Sarah|last=Slota|date=13 January 2020|accessdate=19 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Conception and development==\n[[File:Bregalnica River.JPG|thumb|left|The film was originally planned as a documentary short about preserving the region surrounding river [[Bregalnica]] (''pictured'').]]\n''Honeyland'' marks [[Tamara Kotevska]]'s and [[Ljubomir Stefanov]]'s second collaboration on a documentary movie after ''Lake of Apples'' (2017).<ref>{{cite news |last1=Eagan |first1=Daniel |title='It's a Choice: To Be a Filmmaker or a Human': Ljubomir Stefanov and Tamara Kotevska on Honeyland |url=https://filmmakermagazine.com/107983-its-a-choice-to-be-a-filmmaker-or-a-human-ljubomir-stefanov-and-tamara-kotevska-on-honeyland/#.XhyTzFNKgWo |accessdate=13 January 2020 |work=[[Filmmaker (magazine)|Filmmaker]] |date=22 August 2019}}</ref> The movie was originally intended as [[documentary short]] financially supported by the government.

Bacteria first enter at a break in the skin or [[mucous membrane]] and replicate in the epithelial cells. From there, they use [[flagella]]r motility to spread and infect various cell types. In the bloodstream, the bacteria can infect both [[phagocyte]]s and non-phagocytes. ''B. pseudomallei'' use their flagella to move near [[Host (biology)|host]] cells, then attach to the cells using various adhesion proteins, including the [[type IV pilus]] protein PilA as well as adhesion proteins BoaA and BoaB. Additionally, adhesion of the bacteria partially depends on the presence of the host protein [[Coagulation factor II receptor|Protease-activated receptor-1]] which is present on the surface of [[endothelial cell]]s, [[platelet]]s, and [[monocyte]]s. Once bound, the bacteria enter host cells through [[endocytosis]], ending up inside an endocytic [[Vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicle]]. As the vesicle acidifies, ''B. pseudomallei'' uses its [[Bacterial secretion system#Type III secretion system (T3SS or TTSS)|Type 3 secretion system]] (T3SS) to inject effector proteins into the host cell, disrupting the vesicle and allowing the bacteria to escape into the host [[cytoplasm]]. Within the host cytoplasm, the bacteria evade being killed by the host [[autophagy]] using various T3SS effector proteins. The bacteria replicate in the host cytoplasm.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Gassiep 2020\"/>\n\nInside the host cell, the bacteria move by inducing the polymerization of the host [[actin]] behind them, propelling the bacteria forward.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> This actin-mediated motility is accomplished with the [[Secretion#Type V secretion system .28T5SS.29|autotransporter]] BimA which interacts with actin at the tail-end of the bacterium. Propelled by actin, the bacteria push against the host membrane, creating protrusions that extend into neighbouring cells. These protrusions cause neighboring cells to fuse, leading to the formation of [[multinucleated giant cells]] (MNGCs). When MNGCs lyse, they form plaques (a central clear area with a ring of fused cells) that provide shelter for the bacteria for further replication or [[latent infection]]. This same process in infected neurons can allow bacteria to travel through nerve roots in the spinal cord and brain, leading to [[encephalomyelitis|inflammation of the brain and spinal cord]]. Besides spreading from cell to cell, the bacteria can also spread through the bloodstream, causing sepsis. The bacteria can survive in [[antigen-presenting cell]]s and [[dendritic cell]]s. Thus, these cells act as vehicles that transport the bacteria into the lymphatic system, causing widespread dissemination of the bacteria in the human body.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Gassiep 2020\"/>\n\nWhile ''B. pseudomallei'' can survive in phagocytic cells, these cells can kill ''B. pseudomallei'' by several mechanisms. Macrophages activated by [[interferon gamma]] (IFN) have improved the killing of ''B. pseudomallei'' via the production of [[Nitric oxide synthase#iNOS|inducible nitric oxide synthase]]. Acidification of the endosome and degradation of the bacteria is also possible, however, the bacterial capsule and LPS makes ''B. pseudomallei'' resistant to lysosomal degradation. Once ''B. pseudomallei'' escapes into the host cytosol it can be recognized by [[pattern recognition receptor]]s such as [[NOD-like receptor]]s, triggering the formation of the [[inflammasome]] and activation of [[caspase 1]], which induces death of the host cell by [[pyroptosis]] and further activation of the immune system. Several systemic host defenses also contribute to the immune response. ''B. pseudomallei'' triggers both the [[complement system]] and [[coagulation cascade]], however the thick bacterial capsule prevent the action of the [[complement membrane attack complex]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Gassiep 2020\"/>\n\nAdditional elements of the immune system are activated by the host [[toll-like receptor]]s such as TLR2, TLR4, and TLR5 that recognize the [[pathogen-associated molecular pattern|conserved piece]]s of the bacteria such as LPS and flagella. This activation results in the production of [[cytokine]]s such as [[Interleukin 1 beta]] (IL-1\u03b2) and [[Interleukin 18]] (IL-18). IL-18 increases IFN production through [[natural killer cell]]s while IL-1beta reduces the IFN production. These immune molecules drive the recruitment of other immune cells such as [[neutrophil]]s, [[dendritic cell]]s, [[B cell]]s, and [[T cell]]s to the site of infection. T cells seem to be particularly important for controlling ''B. pseudomallei''; T cell numbers are increased in survivors, and low T cell numbers are associated with a high risk of death from melioidosis. Despite this, HIV infection is not a risk factor for melioidosis. Although macrophages show deregulated [[cytokine]] responses in individuals with HIV infection, bacterial internalization and intracellular killing are still effective. People infected with ''B. pseudomallei'' develop antibodies against the bacteria, and people that live in endemic areas tend to have antibodies in their blood that recognize ''B. pseudomallei''. However, the effectiveness of these antibodies at preventing melioidosis is unclear.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Gassiep 2020\"/>\n\n''B. pseudomallei'' can remain latent in the human body from 19 to 29 years until it is reactivated during human [[immunosuppression]] or stress response. However, the site of bacteria during latent infection and the mechanism by which they avoid immune recognition for years are both unclear. Amongst mechanisms suggested are: residing in the nucleus of the cell to prevent being digested, entering a stage of slower growth, antibiotic resistance, and genetic adaption to the host environment. [[Granuloma]]s (containing neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, and multinucleated giant cells) formed at the infection site in melioidosis have been associated with latent infection in humans.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:Bps close.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|Appearance of ''B. pseudomallei'' colonies on Ashdown's medium after four days of incubation.]]\n[[File:Immunofluorescent-stained sample of guinea pig tissue leads to positive diagnosis of melioidosis.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Immunofluorescent microscopy showing the presence of ''B. pseudomallei''.]]\n[[File:Latex agglutination test positive for melioidosis.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Left most slide showing positive latex agglutination for melioidosis.]]\n\nBacterial culture is the definitive diagnosis of melioidosis. ''B. pseudomallei'' is never part of human flora. Therefore, any growth of the bacteria is diagnostic of melioidosis. Blood cultures are the most common samples for diagnosis, as bacteria can be detected in the blood in 50 to 60% of melioidosis cases. Other samples such as throat, rectal swabs, pus from abscesses, and sputum can also be used for culture. When bacteria do not grow from people strongly suspected of having melioidosis, repeated cultures should be taken as subsequent cultures can become positive.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> ''B. pseudomallei'' can be grown on sheep blood agar, [[MacConkey agar]], [[Ashdown's medium]] (containing [[gentamicin]]),<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> or Ashdown's broth (containing [[colistin]]).<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Agar plates for melioidosis should be incubated at 37&nbsp;\u00b0C (98.6&nbsp;\u00b0F) in air <ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> and inspected daily for four days. On the agar plates, ''B. pseudomallei'' forms creamy, [[Hemolysis (microbiology)|non-haemolytic]], colonies after 2 days of incubation. After 4 days of incubation, colonies appear dry and wrinkled.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Colonies of ''B. pseudomallei'' that are grown on Francis medium (a modification of Ashdown medium with gentamicin concentration increased to 8&nbsp;mg/L) are yellow. For laboratories located outside endemic areas, ''Burkholderia cepacia'' selective agar or ''Pseudomonas'' selective agar can be used if Ashdown's medium is not available.<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> It is important not misinterpret the bacterial growth as ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' or ''[[Bacillus]]'' spp. Other biochemical screening tools can also be used for detecting ''B. pseudomallei'', including the [[analytical profile index|API 20NE or 20E biochemical kit]] combined with Gram stain, [[oxidase test]], typical growth characteristics, and resistance to certain antibiotics of the bacteria.<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Molecular methods such as 16S rDNA probes and [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) can also be used to detect ''B. pseudomallei'' in culture, but they are only available in research and reference laboratories.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nGeneral blood tests in people with melioidosis show low white blood cell counts (indicates infection), raised liver enzymes, increased [[bilirubin]] levels (indicates liver dysfunction), and raised urea and creatinine levels (indicates kidney dysfunction). [[Hypoglycemia|Low blood glucose]] and [[acidosis]] predicts a poorer prognosis in those with melioidosis. However, other tests such as [[C-reactive protein]] and [[procalcitonin]] levels are not reliable in predicting the severity of melioidosis infection.<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/>\n\nBy microscopy, ''B. pseudomallei'' is seen as [[Gram stain|gram-negative]] and rod-shaped, with a bipolar staining similar in appearance to a safety pin. Bacteria can sometimes be seen directly in clinical samples from infected people; however, identification by light microscopy is neither [[Sensitivity and specificity|specific]] nor [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitive]]. [[Immunofluorescence microscopy]] is highly specific for detecting bacteria directly from clinical specimens, but has less than 50% sensitivity.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> A lateral flow immunoassay has been developed but not extensively evaluated.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> An increasing number of laboratories use [[Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization]] (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry to identify the bacteria accurately.<ref name=\"Gassiep 2020\"/>\n\n[[serology|Serological test]]s such as indirect [[haemagglutination assay|haemagglutination]] have been used to detect the presence of antibodies against ''B. pseudomallei''. However, different groups of people have widely different levels of antibodies, so interpretation of these tests depends on location. In Australia, less than 5% of people have ''B. pseudomallei'' antibodies, so the presence of even relatively low amounts of antibody is unusual and could suggest melioidosis. In Thailand, many people have antibodies against ''B. pseudomallei'' so only a relatively high amount of antibody in the blood suggests melioidosis.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Thailand also uses [[Direct fluorescent antibody|direct immunofluorescent antibody test]] (IFAT) and latex agglutination.  In IFAT, both ''B. pseudomallei'' antigen and ''B. thailandensis'' can be used to quantify the amount of antibodies produced against the bacteria. Therefore, the results have to be interpreted with caution as there could be a false-positive reaction if someone is previously exposed to non-pathogenic ''B. thailandensis''.<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> [[Latex agglutination]] is useful in screening for suspected ''B. pseudomallei'' colonies.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> A commercial [[ELISA]] kit for melioidosis appears to perform well.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Limmathurotsakul D, Chantratita N, Teerawattanasook N, et al |title= Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay for the Diagnosis of Melioidosis: Better Than We Thought|journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases|year=2011|volume=52|issue=8|pages=1024&ndash;1028|pmid=21460318|doi=10.1093/cid/cir080|pmc=3070030}}</ref> but no ELISA test has yet been clinically validated as a diagnostic tool.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Peacock SJ, Cheng AC, Currie BJ, Dance DA|title=The Use of Positive Serological Tests as Evidence of Exposure to ''Burkholderia pseudomallei''|journal=American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene|year=2011|volume=84|issue=6|pages= 1021&ndash;1022|pmid=21633045|doi=10.4269/ajtmh.2011.11-0114a| pmc=3110358}}</ref>\n\nIt is not possible to diagnose melioidosis on imaging studies alone<ref name=\"Lim2010\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Lim KS, Chong VH |title=Radiological manifestations of melioidosis|journal=Clinical Radiology|year=2010|volume=65|issue=1|pmid=20103424|pages=66&ndash;72|doi=10.1016/j.crad.2009.08.008}}</ref> (such as [[X-rays]], ultrasound, and CT scans),<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/><ref name=\"Lim2010\"/> but imaging is routinely performed to assess the extent of disease spread.<ref name=\"Muttarak2008\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Muttarak M, Peh WC, Euathrongchit J, Lin SE, Tan AG, Lerttumnongtum P, Sivasomboon C |title=Spectrum of imaging findings in melioidosis|journal= British Journal of Radiology|year=2008|pmid=19098086|volume=82|issue=978|pages=514\u2013521|doi=10.1259/bjr/15785231}}</ref> Imaging of the abdomen using CT scans or ultrasound is recommended routinely, as abscesses may not be clinically apparent and may coexist with disease elsewhere.

Those who are at high risk of contact with the bacteria should wear protective gear (such as boots and gloves) during work.

In children, co-trimoxazole is taken together with [[folic acid]] (0.1&nbsp;mg/kg up to 5&nbsp;mg in children). There are also cases where melioidosis is successfully treated with co-trimoxazole for 3 months without going through intensive therapy provided that there is only skin manifestations without involvement of internal organs or sepsis.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Resistance to cotrimoxazole is rare in Australia.<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/>\n\n===Surgery===\nSurgical drainage is indicated for single, large abscesses in the liver, muscle, and prostate. However, for multiple abscesses in the liver, spleen, and kidney, surgical drainage may not be possible or necessary. For septic arthritis, [[arthrotomy]] washout and drainage is required. Surgical [[debridement]] may be necessary. For those with [[mycotic aneurysm]], urgent surgery is required for prosthetic vascular grafts. Life-long therapy with co-trimoxazole may be needed for those with prosthetic vascular grafts. Other abscesses rarely need to be drained because the majority of them can resolve with antibiotic treatment.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> In Australia, prostate abscess may require routine imaging and drainage.<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/>\n\n===Others===\nImmunomodulating therapies such as [[granulocyte colony-stimulating factor]], [[Interleukin 7]], and anti-PDI ([[programmed cell death]]) could be useful in melioidosis treatment especially for those with septic shock. This is because these drugs could help to boost the human body immune function against the bacteria.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n==Prognosis==\nIn well-resourced settings, where the disease can be detected and treated early, the risk of death is 10%. In resource-poor settings, the risk of death from the disease is more than 40%.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nFor those with incomplete treatment, reppearance of symptoms after a period of disease [[cure|remission]] (\"[[recrudescence]]\") can occur. Then, hospital admission is needed for intravenous antibiotics. For those who have completed treatment successfully, recurrence can also occur due to recrudescence or new melioidosis infection. With better therapies, the recrudescence rate has reduced from 10% to 5%. New infection is now more common than recrudescence.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Risk factors of recrudescence include severity of disease (patients with positive blood cultures or multifocal disease have a higher risk of relapse), choice of antibiotic for eradication therapy (doxycycline monotherapy and fluoroquinolone therapy are not as effective), poor compliance with eradication therapy and duration of eradication therapy less than 8 weeks.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Direk2006\"/><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Chaowagul W, Suputtamongkol Y, Dance DA, Rajchanuvong A, Pattara-arechachai J, White NJ | year=1993 | title=Relapse in melioidosis: incidence and risk factors | journal=Journal of Infectious Diseases | volume=168 | pages=1181&ndash;1185 | pmid=8228352 | issue=5 | doi=10.1093/infdis/168.5.1181}}</ref>\n\nUnderlying medical conditions such as diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and cancer can worsen the long-term survival and disability of those who recover from infection.

Bacteria first enter at a break in the skin or [[mucous membrane]] and replicate in the epithelial cells. From there, they use [[flagella]]r motility to spread and infect various cell types. In the bloodstream, the bacteria can infect both [[phagocyte]]s and non-phagocytes. ''B. pseudomallei'' use their flagella to move near [[Host (biology)|host]] cells, then attach to the cells using various adhesion proteins, including the [[type IV pilus]] protein PilA as well as adhesion proteins BoaA and BoaB. Additionally, adhesion of the bacteria partially depends on the presence of the host protein [[Coagulation factor II receptor|Protease-activated receptor-1]] which is present on the surface of [[endothelial cell]]s, [[platelet]]s, and [[monocyte]]s. Once bound, the bacteria enter host cells through [[endocytosis]], ending up inside an endocytic [[Vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicle]]. As the vesicle acidifies, ''B. pseudomallei'' uses its [[Bacterial secretion system#Type III secretion system (T3SS or TTSS)|Type 3 secretion system]] (T3SS) to inject effector proteins into the host cell, disrupting the vesicle and allowing the bacteria to escape into the host [[cytoplasm]]. Within the host cytoplasm, the bacteria evade being killed by the host [[autophagy]] using various T3SS effector proteins. The bacteria replicate in the host cytoplasm.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Gassiep 2020\"/>\n\nInside the host cell, the bacteria move by inducing the polymerization of the host [[actin]] behind them, propelling the bacteria forward.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> This actin-mediated motility is accomplished with the [[Secretion#Type V secretion system .28T5SS.29|autotransporter]] BimA which interacts with actin at the tail-end of the bacterium. Propelled by actin, the bacteria push against the host membrane, creating protrusions that extend into neighbouring cells. These protrusions cause neighboring cells to fuse, leading to the formation of [[multinucleated giant cells]] (MNGCs). When MNGCs lyse, they form plaques (a central clear area with a ring of fused cells) that provide shelter for the bacteria for further replication or [[latent infection]]. This same process in infected neurons can allow bacteria to travel through nerve roots in the spinal cord and brain, leading to [[encephalomyelitis|inflammation of the brain and spinal cord]]. Besides spreading from cell to cell, the bacteria can also spread through the bloodstream, causing sepsis. The bacteria can survive in [[antigen-presenting cell]]s and [[dendritic cell]]s. Thus, these cells act as vehicles that transport the bacteria into the lymphatic system, causing widespread dissemination of the bacteria in the human body.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Gassiep 2020\"/>\n\nWhile ''B. pseudomallei'' can survive in phagocytic cells, these cells can kill ''B. pseudomallei'' by several mechanisms. Macrophages activated by [[interferon gamma]] (IFN) have improved the killing of ''B. pseudomallei'' via the production of [[Nitric oxide synthase#iNOS|inducible nitric oxide synthase]]. Acidification of the endosome and degradation of the bacteria is also possible, however, the bacterial capsule and LPS makes ''B. pseudomallei'' resistant to lysosomal degradation. Once ''B. pseudomallei'' escapes into the host cytosol it can be recognized by [[pattern recognition receptor]]s such as [[NOD-like receptor]]s, triggering the formation of the [[inflammasome]] and activation of [[caspase 1]], which induces death of the host cell by [[pyroptosis]] and further activation of the immune system. Several systemic host defenses also contribute to the immune response. ''B. pseudomallei'' triggers both the [[complement system]] and [[coagulation cascade]], however the thick bacterial capsule prevent the action of the [[complement membrane attack complex]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Gassiep 2020\"/>\n\nAdditional elements of the immune system are activated by the host [[toll-like receptor]]s such as TLR2, TLR4, and TLR5 that recognize the [[pathogen-associated molecular pattern|conserved piece]]s of the bacteria such as LPS and flagella. This activation results in the production of [[cytokine]]s such as [[Interleukin 1 beta]] (IL-1\u03b2) and [[Interleukin 18]] (IL-18). IL-18 increases IFN production through [[natural killer cell]]s while IL-1beta reduces the IFN production. These immune molecules drive the recruitment of other immune cells such as [[neutrophil]]s, [[dendritic cell]]s, [[B cell]]s, and [[T cell]]s to the site of infection. T cells seem to be particularly important for controlling ''B. pseudomallei''; T cell numbers are increased in survivors, and low T cell numbers are associated with a high risk of death from melioidosis. Despite this, HIV infection is not a risk factor for melioidosis. Although macrophages show deregulated [[cytokine]] responses in individuals with HIV infection, bacterial internalization and intracellular killing are still effective. People infected with ''B. pseudomallei'' develop antibodies against the bacteria, and people that live in endemic areas tend to have antibodies in their blood that recognize ''B. pseudomallei''. However, the effectiveness of these antibodies at preventing melioidosis is unclear.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Gassiep 2020\"/>\n\n''B. pseudomallei'' can remain latent in the human body from 19 to 29 years until it is reactivated during human [[immunosuppression]] or stress response. However, the site of bacteria during latent infection and the mechanism by which they avoid immune recognition for years are both unclear. Amongst mechanisms suggested are: residing in the nucleus of the cell to prevent being digested, entering a stage of slower growth, antibiotic resistance, and genetic adaption to the host environment. [[Granuloma]]s (containing neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, and multinucleated giant cells) formed at the infection site in melioidosis have been associated with latent infection in humans.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:Bps close.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|Appearance of ''B. pseudomallei'' colonies on Ashdown's medium after four days of incubation.]]\n[[File:Immunofluorescent-stained sample of guinea pig tissue leads to positive diagnosis of melioidosis.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Immunofluorescent microscopy showing the presence of ''B. pseudomallei''.]]\n[[File:Latex agglutination test positive for melioidosis.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Left most slide showing positive latex agglutination for melioidosis.]]\n\nBacterial culture is the definitive diagnosis of melioidosis. ''B. pseudomallei'' is never part of human flora. Therefore, any growth of the bacteria is diagnostic of melioidosis. Blood cultures are the most common samples for diagnosis, as bacteria can be detected in the blood in 50 to 60% of melioidosis cases. Other samples such as throat, rectal swabs, pus from abscesses, and sputum can also be used for culture. When bacteria do not grow from people strongly suspected of having melioidosis, repeated cultures should be taken as subsequent cultures can become positive.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> ''B. pseudomallei'' can be grown on sheep blood agar, [[MacConkey agar]], [[Ashdown's medium]] (containing [[gentamicin]]),<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> or Ashdown's broth (containing [[colistin]]).<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Agar plates for melioidosis should be incubated at 37&nbsp;\u00b0C (98.6&nbsp;\u00b0F) in air <ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> and inspected daily for four days. On the agar plates, ''B. pseudomallei'' forms creamy, [[Hemolysis (microbiology)|non-haemolytic]], colonies after 2 days of incubation. After 4 days of incubation, colonies appear dry and wrinkled.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Colonies of ''B. pseudomallei'' that are grown on Francis medium (a modification of Ashdown medium with gentamicin concentration increased to 8&nbsp;mg/L) are yellow. For laboratories located outside endemic areas, ''Burkholderia cepacia'' selective agar or ''Pseudomonas'' selective agar can be used if Ashdown's medium is not available.<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> It is important not misinterpret the bacterial growth as ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' or ''[[Bacillus]]'' spp. Other biochemical screening tools can also be used for detecting ''B. pseudomallei'', including the [[analytical profile index|API 20NE or 20E biochemical kit]] combined with Gram stain, [[oxidase test]], typical growth characteristics, and resistance to certain antibiotics of the bacteria.<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Molecular methods such as 16S rDNA probes and [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) can also be used to detect ''B. pseudomallei'' in culture, but they are only available in research and reference laboratories.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nGeneral blood tests in people with melioidosis show low white blood cell counts (indicates infection), raised liver enzymes, increased [[bilirubin]] levels (indicates liver dysfunction), and raised urea and creatinine levels (indicates kidney dysfunction). [[Hypoglycemia|Low blood glucose]] and [[acidosis]] predicts a poorer prognosis in those with melioidosis. However, other tests such as [[C-reactive protein]] and [[procalcitonin]] levels are not reliable in predicting the severity of melioidosis infection.<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/>\n\nBy microscopy, ''B. pseudomallei'' is seen as [[Gram stain|gram-negative]] and rod-shaped, with a bipolar staining similar in appearance to a safety pin. Bacteria can sometimes be seen directly in clinical samples from infected people; however, identification by light microscopy is neither [[Sensitivity and specificity|specific]] nor [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitive]]. [[Immunofluorescence microscopy]] is highly specific for detecting bacteria directly from clinical specimens, but has less than 50% sensitivity.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> A lateral flow immunoassay has been developed but not extensively evaluated.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> An increasing number of laboratories use [[Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization]] (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry to identify the bacteria accurately.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/>\n\n[[serology|Serological test]]s such as indirect [[haemagglutination assay|haemagglutination]] have been used to detect the presence of antibodies against ''B. pseudomallei''. However, different groups of people have widely different levels of antibodies, so interpretation of these tests depends on location. In Australia, less than 5% of people have ''B. pseudomallei'' antibodies, so the presence of even relatively low amounts of antibody is unusual and could suggest melioidosis. In Thailand, many people have antibodies against ''B. pseudomallei'' so only a relatively high amount of antibody in the blood suggests melioidosis.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Thailand also uses [[Direct fluorescent antibody|direct immunofluorescent antibody test]] (IFAT) and latex agglutination.  In IFAT, both ''B. pseudomallei'' antigen and ''B. thailandensis'' can be used to quantify the amount of antibodies produced against the bacteria. Therefore, the results have to be interpreted with caution as there could be a false-positive reaction if someone is previously exposed to non-pathogenic ''B. thailandensis''.<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> [[Latex agglutination]] is useful in screening for suspected ''B. pseudomallei'' colonies.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> A commercial [[ELISA]] kit for melioidosis appears to perform well.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Limmathurotsakul D, Chantratita N, Teerawattanasook N, et al |title= Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay for the Diagnosis of Melioidosis: Better Than We Thought|journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases|year=2011|volume=52|issue=8|pages=1024&ndash;1028|pmid=21460318|doi=10.1093/cid/cir080|pmc=3070030}}</ref> but no ELISA test has yet been clinically validated as a diagnostic tool.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Peacock SJ, Cheng AC, Currie BJ, Dance DA|title=The Use of Positive Serological Tests as Evidence of Exposure to ''Burkholderia pseudomallei''|journal=American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene|year=2011|volume=84|issue=6|pages= 1021&ndash;1022|pmid=21633045|doi=10.4269/ajtmh.2011.11-0114a| pmc=3110358}}</ref>\n\nIt is not possible to diagnose melioidosis on imaging studies alone<ref name=\"Lim2010\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Lim KS, Chong VH |title=Radiological manifestations of melioidosis|journal=Clinical Radiology|year=2010|volume=65|issue=1|pmid=20103424|pages=66&ndash;72|doi=10.1016/j.crad.2009.08.008}}</ref> (such as [[X-rays]], ultrasound, and CT scans),<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/><ref name=\"Lim2010\"/> but imaging is routinely performed to assess the extent of disease spread.<ref name=\"Muttarak2008\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Muttarak M, Peh WC, Euathrongchit J, Lin SE, Tan AG, Lerttumnongtum P, Sivasomboon C |title=Spectrum of imaging findings in melioidosis|journal= British Journal of Radiology|year=2008|pmid=19098086|volume=82|issue=978|pages=514\u2013521|doi=10.1259/bjr/15785231}}</ref> Imaging of the abdomen using CT scans or ultrasound is recommended routinely, as abscesses may not be clinically apparent and may coexist with disease elsewhere.

With better therapies, the recrudescence rate has reduced from 10% to 5%. New infection is now more common than recrudescence.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Risk factors of recrudescence include severity of disease (patients with positive blood cultures or multifocal disease have a higher risk of relapse), choice of antibiotic for eradication therapy (doxycycline monotherapy and fluoroquinolone therapy are not as effective), poor compliance with eradication therapy and duration of eradication therapy less than 8 weeks.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Direk2006\"/><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Chaowagul W, Suputtamongkol Y, Dance DA, Rajchanuvong A, Pattara-arechachai J, White NJ | year=1993 | title=Relapse in melioidosis: incidence and risk factors | journal=Journal of Infectious Diseases | volume=168 | pages=1181&ndash;1185 | pmid=8228352 | issue=5 | doi=10.1093/infdis/168.5.1181}}</ref>\n\nUnderlying medical conditions such as diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and cancer can worsen the long-term survival and disability of those who recover from infection.

The name  was changed  in 1902 to ''Rhizopus stolonifer'' by the French mycologist J. P.  Vuillemin.<ref name = onions1981/>\n\n==Habitat and ecology==\n''Rhizopus stolonifer'' is a worldwide distributed species. It is found on all types of mouldy materials. It is often one of the first [[Mold (fungus)|mold]]s to appear on stale bread.<ref name = onions1981/> It can exist in the soil as well as in the air. A variety of natural substrata are colonized by this species because ''R. stolonifer'' can tolerate broad variations in the concentration of essential nutrients and can use carbon and nitrogen combined in diverse forms.<ref name = onions1981/>\n\nIn the laboratory, this fungus grows well on different media, including those that contain [[ammonium salt]]s or amino compounds.<ref name = onions1981/> However, ''R. stolonifer'' will not grow on [[Czapek medium|Czapek\u2019s agar]] (CZA) because it cannot utilize nitrogen in the form of nitrate.<ref name = onions1981/>Rhizopus lives in hyphae and matured spores\n\n== Growth and physiology ==\n[[File:Rhizopus_stolonifer2.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Gem-shaped sporangiospores of ''R. stolonifer'' showing characteristic striations.]]This species is known as a [[saprotroph]] and plays an important role in the early colonization of substrata in soil. Nonetheless, it can also behave as a [[Parasitism|parasite]] of plant tissues causing a rot of vegetables and fruits.<ref name = Webster2007/> Like other species of ''Rhizopus'', ''R. stolonifer'' grows rapidly and spreads by means of the [[stolon]]s.<ref name = Webster2007/> The stolons provide an aerial structure for the growth of the [[mycelium]] and the occupation of large areas. They can climb vertically as well as horizontally.<ref name = Vanbreuseghem1965/> Sporangiophores of ''R. stolonifer'' can be up to 2.5&nbsp;mm long and about 20&nbsp;\u03bcm in diameter.<ref name = onions1981/> The [[spore]]s are shaped differently depending on the available nutrients. They can be ovate, polygonal or angular.<ref name = onions1981/> The optimal temperature for growth varies between 25-30&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref name = Vanbreuseghem1965/> The thermal death point, which is defined as the lowest temperature that can kill all cells in ten minutes, is 60&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref name = Vanbreuseghem1965/> ''Rhizopus stolonifer'' can grow in acidic environments with a pH of as low as 2.2. The pH range can vary from 2.2 to 9.6.<ref name = Skinner1930/> [[Ultraviolet irradiation]] can delay spore [[germination]].<ref name = Ainsworth1965/>\n\n==Reproduction==\n''Rhizopus stolonifer'' can reproduce asexually and sexually. It is a [[Heterothallism|heterothallic]] species.<ref name = Moore-Landecker1972/> Sexual reproduction occurs when compatible mating strains are paired, ultimately giving rise to [[zygospore]]s. The sporangiophore contains both '+' and '\u2212' mating type strains.<ref name = Brown/> [[Meiosis]] is delayed until the germination of the zygospores. The [[Gametogonium|gametogenia]] often differ in size, regardless of mating type. This difference in size is not due to sex but presumably due to nutrition.<ref name = Gwynne-Vaughan1927/>\n\n==Disease and prevention==\n[[File:Rhizopus_stolonifer_on_a_strawberry_showing_black_sporangia.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''R. stolonifer'' colonizing a strawberry.]]\nThe disease caused by this fungus occurs mainly on ripe fruits, such as strawberries, melon and peach, which are more susceptible to wounds and have a higher sugar content.<ref name = Baggio2016/> After a couple of days, the infected fruits become soft and release juices with an acidic odour.<ref name = Baggio2016/> When the humidity and temperature are favourable, the mycelial growth occurs rapidly at the surface of the infected fruit and the disease causes the development of long mycelial stolons with black [[Sporangium|sporangia]] and spores.<ref name = Baggio2016/> When the fungus germinates, it produces different kinds of [[esterase]]s, including [[cutinase]], which help the fungus to penetrate the plant cell wall.<ref name = Baggio2016/> The disease can also affect other adjacent healthy fruits when distributed by wind or insect activity.<ref name = Alexopoulos1952/>\n\nSome species of ''Syncephalis'' can reduce the asexual reproduction of ''R. stolonifer'' and therefore may delay or even prevent the post-harvest disease caused by this fungus.<ref name = baker1977/> Fengycin, which is an anti-fungal complex, also induces the fungal cell death via [[necrosis]] and [[apoptosis]].<ref name = Tang2014/> The treatment of sweet potatoes with [[sodium orthophenyl phenol]] (Stopmold B) and dichloran (Botran W) have effectively reduced storage rot.<ref name = Sarbhoy1966/>\n\n''Rhizopus stolonifer'' is an [[Opportunism|opportunistic]] agent of disease and hence will only cause infection in people with a weakened immunity. [[Zygomycosis]] is the main disease that might be caused by this fungus in humans and while it is not entirely understood yet, this disease is very dangerous and can be fatal.<ref name = Brown/> The action of smelling spoiled food may be a source of inhalation exposure to the mold.<ref name = Brown/>\n\n==Importance==\n''Rhizopus stolonifer'' is important economically as an agent of post-harvest storage decay.\n\nWhile ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' is the most important source of industrial alcohol, ''R. stolonifer'' and other species of ''Rhizopus'' also produce [[ethyl alcohol]] which is the most important [[fermentation]] product.<ref name=\"Alexopoulos1952\" /> ''Rhizopus stolonifer'' is also used commercially to manufacture [[fumaric acid]] and [[lactic acid]] of high purity.<ref

(1893)</small>\n}}\n\n'''''Rhizopus stolonifer''''' is commonly known as '''black bread mold'''.<ref name = Ellis/> It is  a member of ''[[Zygomycota]]'' and considered the most important species in the genus ''[[Rhizopus]]''.<ref name = Webster2007/> It is one of the most common fungi in the world and has a global distribution although it is most commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions.<ref name = Moore-Landecker1972/> It is a common agent of decomposition of stored foods.<ref name = Alexopoulos1952/> Like other members of the genus ''Rhizopus'', ''R. stolonifer'' grows rapidly, mostly in indoor environments.<ref name = Benny2016/>\n\n==History==\nThis fungus was first discovered by the German scientist [[Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg]] in 1818  as ''Rhizopus nigricans''. The name  was changed  in 1902 to ''Rhizopus stolonifer'' by the French mycologist J. P.  Vuillemin.<ref name = onions1981/>\n\n==Habitat and ecology==\n''Rhizopus stolonifer'' is a worldwide distributed species. It is found on all types of mouldy materials. It is often one of the first [[mold]]s to appear on stale bread.<ref name = onions1981/> It can exist in the soil as well as in the air. A variety of natural substrata are colonized by this species because ''R. stolonifer'' can tolerate broad variations in the concentration of essential nutrients and can use carbon and nitrogen combined in diverse forms.<ref name = onions1981/>\n\nIn the laboratory, this fungus grows well on different media, including those that contain [[ammonium salt]]s or amino compounds.<ref name = onions1981/> However, ''R. stolonifer'' will not grow on [[Czapek medium|Czapek\u2019s agar]] (CZA) because it cannot utilize nitrogen in the form of nitrate.<ref name = onions1981/>Rhizopus lives in hyphae and matured spores\n\n== Growth and physiology ==\n[[File:Rhizopus_stolonifer2.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Gem-shaped sporangiospores of ''R. stolonifer'' showing characteristic striations.]]This species is known as a [[saprotroph]] and plays an important role in the early colonization of substrata in soil. Nonetheless, it can also behave as a [[Parasitism|parasite]] of plant tissues causing a rot of vegetables and fruits.<ref name = Webster2007/> Like other species of ''Rhizopus'', ''R. stolonifer'' grows rapidly and spreads by means of the [[stolon]]s.<ref name = Webster2007/> The stolons provide an aerial structure for the growth of the [[mycelium]] and the occupation of large areas. They can climb vertically as well as horizontally.<ref name = Vanbreuseghem1965/> Sporangiophores of ''R. stolonifer'' can be up to 2.5&nbsp;mm long and about 20&nbsp;\u03bcm in diameter.<ref name = onions1981/> The [[spore]]s are shaped differently depending on the available nutrients. They can be ovate, polygonal or angular.<ref name = onions1981/> The optimal temperature for growth varies between 25-30&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref name = Vanbreuseghem1965/> The thermal death point, which is defined as the lowest temperature that can kill all cells in ten minutes, is 60&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref name = Vanbreuseghem1965/> ''Rhizopus stolonifer'' can grow in acidic environments with a pH of as low as 2.2. The pH range can vary from 2.2 to 9.6.<ref name = Skinner1930/> [[Ultraviolet irradiation]] can delay spore [[germination]].<ref name = Ainsworth1965/>\n\n==Reproduction==\n''Rhizopus stolonifer'' can reproduce asexually and sexually. It is a [[Heterothallism|heterothallic]] species.<ref name = Moore-Landecker1972/> Sexual reproduction occurs when compatible mating strains are paired, ultimately giving rise to [[zygospore]]s. The sporangiophore contains both '+' and '\u2212' mating type strains.<ref name = Brown/> [[Meiosis]] is delayed until the germination of the zygospores. The [[Gametogonium|gametogenia]] often differ in size, regardless of mating type. This difference in size is not due to sex but presumably due to nutrition.<ref name = Gwynne-Vaughan1927/>\n\n==Disease and prevention==\n[[File:Rhizopus_stolonifer_on_a_strawberry_showing_black_sporangia.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''R. stolonifer'' colonizing a strawberry.]]\nThe disease caused by this fungus occurs mainly on ripe fruits, such as strawberries, melon and peach, which are more susceptible to wounds and have a higher sugar content.<ref name = Baggio2016/> After a couple of days, the infected fruits become soft and release juices with an acidic odour.<ref name = Baggio2016/> When the humidity and temperature are favourable, the mycelial growth occurs rapidly at the surface of the infected fruit and the disease causes the development of long mycelial stolons with black [[Sporangium|sporangia]] and spores.<ref name = Baggio2016/> When the fungus germinates, it produces different kinds of [[esterase]]s, including [[cutinase]], which help the fungus to penetrate the plant cell wall.<ref name = Baggio2016/> The disease can also affect other adjacent healthy fruits when distributed by wind or insect activity.<ref name = Alexopoulos1952/>\n\nSome species of ''Syncephalis'' can reduce the asexual reproduction of ''R. stolonifer'' and therefore may delay or even prevent the post-harvest disease caused by this fungus.<ref name = baker1977/> Fengycin, which is an anti-fungal complex, also induces the fungal cell death via [[necrosis]] and [[apoptosis]].<ref name = Tang2014/> The treatment of sweet potatoes with [[sodium orthophenyl phenol]] (Stopmold B) and dichloran (Botran W) have effectively reduced storage rot.<ref name = Sarbhoy1966/>\n\n''Rhizopus stolonifer'' is an [[Opportunism|opportunistic]] agent of disease and hence will only cause infection in people with a weakened immunity. [[Zygomycosis]] is the main disease that might be caused by this fungus in humans and while it is not entirely understood yet, this disease is very dangerous and can be fatal.<ref name = Brown/> The action of smelling spoiled food may be a source of inhalation exposure to the mold.<ref name = Brown/>\n\n==Importance==\n''Rhizopus stolonifer'' is important economically as an agent of post-harvest storage decay.\n\nWhile ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' is the most important source of industrial alcohol, ''R. stolonifer'' and other species of ''Rhizopus'' also produce [[ethyl alcohol]] which is the most important [[fermentation]] product.<ref name=\"Alexopoulos1952\" /> ''Rhizopus stolonifer'' is also used commercially to manufacture [[fumaric acid]] and [[lactic acid]] of high purity.<ref name=\"Campbell2013\" /> The presence of [[zinc]] reduces the amount of fumaric acid produced by the fungus.<ref name=\"Ainsworth1965\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=<ref name =
