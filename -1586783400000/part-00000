Television producer [[Joan Ganz Cooney]] and foundation executive [[Lloyd Morrisett]] developed the idea to form an organization to produce ''[[Sesame Street]]'', a television series which would help children, especially those from low-income families, prepare for school. They spent two years, from 1966 to 1968, researching, developing, and raising money for the new series. Cooney was named as the Workshop's first executive director, which was termed \"one of the most important television developments of the decade\".<ref name=\"davis125126\" />\n\n''Sesame Street'' premiered as a series on [[National Educational Television]] (NET) in the United States on November 10, 1969, and moved to NET's successor, the Public Broadcasting Service ([[PBS]]), in late 1970. The Workshop was formally incorporated in 1970. [[Gerald S. Lesser]] and [[Edward L. Palmer]] were hired to perform research for the series; they were responsible for developing a system of planning, production, and evaluation, and the interaction between television producers and educators, later termed the \"CTW model\". They also hired a staff of producers and writers. After the initial success of ''Sesame Street'', they began to plan for its continued survival, which included procuring additional sources of funding and creating other television series. The early 1980s were a challenging period for the Workshop; difficulty finding audiences for their other productions and a series of bad investments harmed the organization until licensing agreements stabilized its revenues by 1985.\n\nAfter ''Sesame Street''{{'}}s initial success, the CTW began to think about its survival beyond the development and first season of the show, since their funding sources were composed of organizations and institutions that tended to start projects, not sustain them. Government funding ended by 1981, so the CTW developed other activities, including unsuccessful ventures into adult programs, the publications of books and music, international co-productions, interactive media and new technologies, licensing arrangements, and programs for preschools. By 2005, income from the CTW's international co-productions of the series was $96 million. By 2008, the ''Sesame Street'' [[List of Sesame Street Muppets|Muppets]] accounted for $15\u201317 million per year in licensing and merchandising fees. Cooney resigned as CEO in 1990; David Britt was named as her replacement.\n\nOn June 5, 2000, the CTW changed its name to Sesame Workshop<ref>http://www.sesameworkshop.org/about-us/leadership-team/joan-ganz-cooney/</ref> to better represent its activities beyond television, and [[Gary Knell]] became CEO. [[H. Melvin Ming]] replaced Knell in 2011. In 2014, Ming was succeeded by Jeffrey D. Dunn.\n\nIn the main lobby of Sesame Workshop, the Sesame Street Muppets in interactive frames featured [[Elmo (Sesame Street)|Elmo]], [[Big Bird]], [[Cookie Monster]], [[Ernie (Sesame Street)|Ernie]], [[Bert (Sesame Street)|Bert]], [[Cookie Monster]], [[The Bear family|Baby Bear]], [[Count von Count]], [[Murray Monster|Murray]], [[Rosita (Sesame Street)|Rosita]], [[Abby Cadabby]], [[Grover]], Zoe, Telly, [[Oscar the Grouch]] and others.\n\nAt the main lobby, the characters from [[Sesame Street]] wear pajamas as [[Rosita (Sesame Street)]] (a purple doll), [[Telly]] (his doll Freddy) [[Elmo (Sesame Street)]] (Baby David), [[Abby Cadabby]] (Stuffed Frog Prince), [[Zoe (Sesame Street)]] (Mimi), [[Big Bird]] (Radar), [[Bert and Ernie]] (Rubber Duckie), [[Cookie Monster]] and [[Grover]] are singing a lullaby to [[Big Bird]] and go to sleep.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Background ===\nDuring the late 1960s, 97% of all American households owned a television set, and preschool children watched an average of 27 hours of television per week.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Hellman | first = Peter | title = Street Smart: How Big Bird & Company Do It | journal = New York Magazine | volume = 20 | issue = 46 | page = 52 | date = 23 November 1987 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=KOUCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA48&vq=sesame+street&q=sesame%20street | issn = 0028-7369 | accessdate = 18 November 2019}}</ref> Early childhood educational research at the time had shown that when children were prepared to succeed in school, they earned better grades and learned more effectively.

In 1972, the Markle Foundation donated $72,000 to Harvard to form the Center for Research in Children's Television, which served as a research agency for the CTW.

Davis also speculated that sexism was involved, stating, \"Doubters also questioned whether a woman could gain the full confidence of a quorum of men from the federal government and two elite philanthropies, institutions whose wealth exceeded the gross national product of entire countries\".<ref>Davis, p. 124</ref> At first, Cooney did not fight for the position.

Eventually, the CTW got its own line item in the federal budget.<ref>Davis, pp. 218\u2013219</ref>  By 2019, the U.S. government donated about four percent of the Workshop's budget, or less than $5 million a year.<ref name=\"guthrie2\"/>\n\n[[File:Jim Henson (1989).jpg|left|thumb|upright|alt=A tall, thin man in his early fifties, with salty-gray hair and a full beard, and wearing a tuxedo.|[[Jim Henson]], creator of [[the Muppets]], in 1989]]\n\nFor the first time, a public broadcasting series had the potential to earn a great deal of money.  Immediately after its premiere, ''Sesame Street ''gained attention from marketers,<ref name=\"davis-203\" /> so the Workshop explored sources such as licensing arrangements, publishing, and international sales, and became, as Cooney envisioned, a \"multiple media institution\".<ref name=\"cherow-197\">Cherow-O'Leary in Fisch & Truglio, p. 197</ref> Licensing became the foundation of, as writer Louise Gikow stated, the Sesame Workshop endowment,<ref name=\"gikow-268\">Gikow, p. 268</ref> which had the potential to fund the organization and future productions and projects.<ref name=\"davis-205\" /> Muppet creator [[Jim Henson]] owned the trademarks to the [[List of Sesame Street Muppets|Muppet characters]]: he was reluctant to market them at first, but agreed when the CTW promised that the profits from toys, books, and other products were to be used exclusively to fund the CTW. The producers demanded complete control of all products and product decisions throughout its history; any product line associated with the series had to be educational, inexpensive, and not advertised during broadcastings of ''Sesame Street''.<ref>Davis, pp. 203\u2013205</ref> As Davis reported, \"Cooney stressed restraint, prudence, and caution\" in their marketing and licensing efforts.<ref>Davis, p. 204</ref> In the early 1970s, the CTW negotiated with the company [[Random House]] to establish and manage a non-broadcast materials division.

Television producer [[Joan Ganz Cooney]] and foundation executive [[Lloyd Morrisett]] developed the idea to form an organization to produce ''[[Sesame Street]]'', a television series which would help children, especially those from low-income families, prepare for school. They spent two years, from 1966 to 1968, researching, developing, and raising money for the new series. Cooney was named as the Workshop's first executive director, which was termed \"one of the most important television developments of the decade\".<ref name=\"davis125126\" />\n\n''Sesame Street'' premiered as a series on [[National Educational Television]] (NET) in the United States on November 10, 1969, and moved to NET's successor, the Public Broadcasting Service ([[PBS]]), in late 1970. The Workshop was formally incorporated in 1970. [[Gerald S. Lesser]] and [[Edward L. Palmer]] were hired to perform research for the series; they were responsible for developing a system of planning, production, and evaluation, and the interaction between television producers and educators, later termed the \"CTW model\". They also hired a staff of producers and writers. After the initial success of ''Sesame Street'', they began to plan for its continued survival, which included procuring additional sources of funding and creating other television series. The early 1980s were a challenging period for the Workshop; difficulty finding audiences for their other productions and a series of bad investments harmed the organization until licensing agreements stabilized its revenues by 1985.\n\nAfter ''Sesame Street''{{'}}s initial success, the CTW began to think about its survival beyond the development and first season of the show, since their funding sources were composed of organizations and institutions that tended to start projects, not sustain them. Government funding ended by 1981, so the CTW developed other activities, including unsuccessful ventures into adult programs, the publications of books and music, international co-productions, interactive media and new technologies, licensing arrangements, and programs for preschools. By 2005, income from the CTW's international co-productions of the series was $96 million. By 2008, the ''Sesame Street'' [[List of Sesame Street Muppets|Muppets]] accounted for $15\u201317 million per year in licensing and merchandising fees. Cooney resigned as CEO in 1990; David Britt was named as her replacement.\n\nOn June 5, 2000, the CTW changed its name to Sesame Workshop<ref>http://www.sesameworkshop.org/about-us/leadership-team/joan-ganz-cooney/</ref> to better represent its activities beyond television, and [[Gary Knell]] became CEO. [[H. Melvin Ming]] replaced Knell in 2011. In 2014, Ming was succeeded by Jeffrey D. Dunn.\n\nAt the main lobby, the characters from [[Sesame Street]] wear pajamas as [[Rosita (Sesame Street)]] (a purple doll), [[Telly]] (his doll Freddy) [[Elmo (Sesame Street)]] (Baby David), [[Abby Cadabby]] (Stuffed Frog Prince), [[Zoe (Sesame Street)]] (Mimi), [[Big Bird]] (Radar), [[Bert and Ernie]] (Rubber Duckie), [[Cookie Monster]] and [[Grover]] are singing a lullaby to [[Big Bird]] and go to sleep.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Background ===\nDuring the late 1960s, 97% of all American households owned a television set, and preschool children watched an average of 27 hours of television per week.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Hellman | first = Peter | title = Street Smart: How Big Bird & Company Do It | journal = New York Magazine | volume = 20 | issue = 46 | page = 52 | date = 23 November 1987 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=KOUCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA48&vq=sesame+street&q=sesame%20street | issn = 0028-7369 | accessdate = 18 November 2019}}</ref> Early childhood educational research at the time had shown that when children were prepared to succeed in school, they earned better grades and learned more effectively.

Davis also speculated that sexism was involved, stating, \"Doubters also questioned whether a woman could gain the full confidence of a quorum of men from the federal government and two elite philanthropies, institutions whose wealth exceeded the gross national product of entire countries\".<ref>Davis, p. 124</ref> At first, Cooney did not fight for the position. However she had the help of her husband and Morrisett, and the project's investors soon realized they could not begin without her. She was eventually named to the post in February 1968.

Eventually, the CTW got its own line item in the federal budget.<ref>Davis, pp. 218\u2013219</ref>  By 2019, the U.S. government donated about four percent of the Workshop's budget, or less than $5 million a year.<ref name=\"guthrie2\"/>\n\n[[File:Jim Henson (1989).jpg|left|thumb|upright|alt=A tall, thin man in his early fifties, with salty-gray hair and a full beard, and wearing a tuxedo.|[[Jim Henson]], creator of [[the Muppets]], in 1989]]\n\nFor the first time, a public broadcasting series had the potential to earn a great deal of money.

The producers demanded complete control of all products and product decisions throughout its history; any product line associated with the series had to be educational, inexpensive, and not advertised during broadcastings of ''Sesame Street''.<ref>Davis, pp. 203\u2013205</ref> As Davis reported, \"Cooney stressed restraint, prudence, and caution\" in their marketing and licensing efforts.<ref>Davis, p. 204</ref> In the early 1970s, the CTW negotiated with the company [[Random House]] to establish and manage a non-broadcast materials division.

It is 13 miles NNW of [[Blairgowrie and Rattray|Blairgowrie]] and 12 miles ENE of [[Pitlochry]] on the A924 from Bridge of Cally to Pitlochry road, and is linked to the A93 Perth to Aberdeen road by the B950. The village is centred around the bridge over the [[River Ardle]].\n\nThe name Kirkmichael means ''church of (Saint) Michael''; the [[Scots Gaelic|Gaelic]] name is ''Cill Mh\u00eccheil''.  The village dates back over a thousand years and was at one time an important market in the cattle trade between the Highlands and Lowlands with various drove roads converging on the village. The area became popular as a holiday resort following Queen Victoria's building of [[Balmoral Castle]] in nearby Deeside and many of the local shooting lodges, or \"big houses\" as they are known, were built at that time.  Traditionally they were occupied for \"the season\" of August and September, which included the all-important [[Glorious Twelfth]], when [[grouse]] shooting started.\n\n== The village ==\nThe village is split into two by the [[River Ardle]]. On the north side is the A924 (Main Street) with Kirkmichael parish church and graveyard, Session House community centre, Kirkmichael Hotel, shop, garage and traditional properties such as a police station and a old dairy dating from the late 19th century.  On the south side are the primary school, Bannerfield, the volunteer community fire station, the original part of the village known as Williamston, the village hall, the derelict Free Kirk, more recent properties in Sillerburn Road and Whitefield View, Sillerburn Cemetery, Balnald and Balnakilly. The population is approximately 150.\n\nThe original village, known as Williamston, sits above the school on the original highway from Blairgowrie to Blair Atholl, which entered the village past the Hall and Old Kirk and exited by the road to Balnakilly.  This now forms part of the [[Cateran Trail]] long-distance trail, a circular route taking in Blairgowrie, Bridge of Cally, Kirkmichael, Enochdhu, Spittal of Glenshee, Kirkton of Glenisla and Alyth, which takes around five days to walk.\n\n=== Primary School===\n[[File:Kirkmichael_2019.jpeg|thumb|right|A residential street near the primary school]]\n[http://www.kirkmichael.pkc.sch.uk/ Kirkmichael Primary School] sits on the south side of the bridge. The school's catchment area incorporates Strathardle, Kirkmichael, [[Glen Shee|Glenshee]], Blacklunans, [[Bridge of Cally]] and Enochdu.  Pupils continue their secondary school education at [[Blairgowrie High School]].\nOver its lifetime, the school has been extended from a single-storey to a two-storey building, and in 2007 the new nursery and the primary 1-3 building were added.  The grounds contain an all-weather sports court, which is available for public use outwith school hours.\n\n=== The kirks and Session House ===\n[[File:Kirkmichael, Scotland Session House Entrance.jpg|thumb|Session House and kirkyard]]\n[[File:Duff_Memorial_Church.jpeg|thumb|right|The former Duff Memorial Church, now derelict]]\nThe [[Church of Scotland]] parish kirk dates back to the 18th century and is built on a site used for worship for over one thousand years. It is surrounded by the original graveyard which contains graves dating back many centuries. The east end of the graveyard, which does not have headstones or individual graves, is the site of a mass burial plot for the victims of the [[Black Death]] plague of 1348 and has never been reopened. Sillerburn Cemetery, on Balnald Road, was opened in the 1950s and, as of 2019, contains around fifty graves.  Kirkmichael parish was first linked with Straloch, then with Glenshee/Bridge of Cally and finally with Rattray, with the minister now using Rattray manse.  The original manse, opposite the church, was sold in the 1970s and was replaced first by a bungalow in Glenshee then in the 1980s by another bungalow on the Balnald road, which is now rented out.\n\nThe disused Free Kirk, known as the Duff Memorial Church, was built in the late 19th century by the breakaway [[Free Church of Scotland (1843\u20131900)|Free Church of Scotland]].  In 1928 the Free Kirk amalgamated back into the Church of Scotland, with the two churches being used on alternate Sundays until the Duff Memorial finally closed in the 1950s.  It was then used as an agricultural building and in the late 1990s the Village Hall committee drew up plans to acquire the building, restore it to its former glory and provide the village with a 21st-century Community Hall.  However, it was sold to a property developer who then found his plan for conversion to a house was impossible, so the old kirk still sits empty and disused. The Free Kirk manse became a SYHA youth hostel and for 30 years was very popular with cyclists and hikers.  It is now a private house.  Opposite the Old Manse is a cottage which was originally the parish poorhouse.\n\nThe Session House community building is a meeting place for various community groups. Its existence and success owe much to the foresight and tenacity of the parish minister in the 1990s, the Reverend Dr Hugh Ormiston.  Originally the parish school, it was latterly used as a vestry and Sunday School, and was in poor condition before its restoration into the well-equipped building of today.\n\n=== Village shop===\nThe village shop is run by a community-interest company, with local unpaid directors, and incorporates a coffee shop. The adjacent workshop is home to Milford Vintage Engineering, who specialise in the service, maintenance, repair and restoration of vintage and veteran vehicles. The building was erected in 1958 on the site of the disused blacksmith's smithy and garden ground as a sales and repair garage and the shop occupies the former showroom area. At one time Kirkmichael had four shops: one in the house at the school end of Williamston, which closed in the early 20th century, and three in Main Street. One was in the white building now known as MacDonald Cottage. It closed in 1983. The two others were side by side in the three-storey building opposite the present shop.\n\n=== Village hall ===\nThe village hall was opened in 1934 after a period of intense fundraising and is managed by a committee of volunteers. It is used by various local groups including [[Brownies (Scouting)|Brownies]], [[Girl guides|Guides]], [[Cub scouts|Cubs]], martial arts and keep fit, the primary school for Physical Education classes and is home to local functions. It was comprehensively modernised and refurbished in 2018/2019.\n\nMasonic Lodge Strathardle was restarted in the late 1950s after many years in abeyance and was originally located in the east end of the property known as Meadowside. When Meadowside changed hands about ten years later, the Lodge relocated to the annexe of the village hall.\n\n=== Fire station ===\nThe fire station - the third iteration, built in the 1990s - is manned by a part-time crew with a modern appliance.  The original 1960s station was a wooden hut adjacent to Riverview containing equipment and a trailer pump with Kirkmichael Garage providing a towing vehicle as required.  The second station was on the present site in Bannerfield and was a basic Nissen Hut shed housing a Karrier Gamecock appliance but with no crew facilities.  The current station is fitted and equipped to a high standard with office and training facilities.\n\n=== Bannerfield ===\nBannerfield, where the [[Earl of Mar]] raised the standard for the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] rising of [[1715 rising|1715]], provides car parking, recycling facilities and a riverside picnic area.   It is also used for the annual Srathardle Gathering Highland Games.\n\n== Historical monuments and memorials ==\n[[File:James Small Mounument - Scotland.jpg|thumb|right|The James Small Monument]]\n\n=== The War Memorial ===\nThe War Memorial which was erected after World War One sits above the road between the village and the Strathardle Inn. It is sadly neglected and overgrown and the panoramic views it once provided over Kirkmichael are now blocked by trees.\n\n=== The Small Monument ===\nAt the junction of the A924/B950 sits the [[James Small (Scottish laird)|James Small]] (1835\u20131900) of [[Dirnanean House|Dirnanean]] monument, a highly-ornate [[Celtic cross]] erected in honour of a former [[Deputy Lieutenant]] of [[Perthshire]].\n\n=== Whitefield Castle ===\nOff the footpath from the village to [[Glenshee]] lies [[Whitefield Castle]], a ruined hunting lodge built by King Malcolm Canmore in the 11th century.  It is well preserved,  considering it has had no restoration, and can be clearly seen from the road past the cemetery and the Glen Derby road.\n\n=== The Minister's Well ===\nThe old roadside [[water well]] opposite the church is fed by an underground spring which never runs dry.\n\n== The Games ==\n[http://www.strathardle.org Strathardle Highland Gathering & Agricultural Show] is held annually in Kirkmichael on the fourth Saturday of August. The Gathering is currently held in Bannerfield with the Agricultural Show in the adjacent field.  Known locally as \"the Games\", the highlights of the day include:\n* agricultural show with various livestock classes.\n* home industries tent\n* vintage vehicles\n* trade stands\n* [[pipe band]]\n* Highland dancing and piping competitions\n* track and heavy events\n* open [[Tug of war|tug'o'war]]\n* a musical cars event - similar to [[musical chairs]] but involving cars driving round the ring\n* funfair\n* food\n* stalls\n\nThe Gathering started in 1871 and has been held annually, apart from the inter-war years of 1914-18 and 1940-45. Locations included Croft of Dounie, Aldchlappie and Dalnagairn before settling on the current Bannerfield location in the late 1940s.\n\nThe founders of the original games were Alexander Petrie of [[Strathgarry]], [[Killiecrankie]] (originally of [[Ballinloan]], Kirkmichael), \"Mr Michie\" of [[Cluneskea]], [[Enochdhu]], \"Mr James Stewart\" and \"Mr James Dow\".  It is recorded that Petrie et al approached [[James Small (Scottish laird)|James Small]] of [[Dirnanean]] with a proposal to hold an annual gathering, a proposal to which Small gave his \"warm approval\".  Petrie himself subsequently competed in the games of his own founding, principally via \"titling the ring\" on horseback.<ref name=\"The People's Journal\">{{cite news |title=Atholl Farmer's Retiral. |periodical=[[The People's Journal]] |date=24 October 1936 |page=10}}</ref>\n\nThe agricultural show started in the late 1950s and now attracts a large entry of quality livestock.  For over a century, three generations of the Evans family from Glasgow attended the Gathering with their travelling funfair and sideshows and \"Evans shows\", as they were known, were an integral part of the Games and of village life.  In the 1950s and 1960s the fair stayed for two weeks and attracted large crowds with bingo, slot machines and shooting the main attractions. The Evans made their last visit in 2009.\n\n== The Glen ==\nKirkmichael is the largest village in [[Strathardle]]. Known locally as \"the glen\", the [[strath]] runs for 13 miles from [[Glen Brerachean]] on the Moulin Moors to the confluence of the River Ardle and the Blackwater just east of [[Bridge of Cally]].  The Ardle starts opposite the road to Glenfernate, where the Brerachean and the Fernate meet, and is bridged at Enochdhu, Kirkmichael, Pitcarmick, Dalnabreck, Ballintuim, Blackcraig, Cally Lodge and Bridge of Cally. The bridge to Blackcraig is of architectural significance as it has a house built over it.  The house on the bridge is one of the glen's best kept secrets. Strathardle is named after a Pictish warrior called Ardle who was killed at Enochdhu in a battle with the [[Danish people|Danes]] in the 12th century. His burial mound in the grounds of Dirnanean Lodge is over twelve feet long but whether he was a giant as reputed or had another warrior buried at his feet is unknown.\n\nPublic transport connects Kirkmichael with [[Blairgowrie and Rattray|Blairgowrie]], Tarvie and [[Spittal of Glenshee]]. The nearest railway station is [[Pitlochry railway station]] (12 miles), from where there is direct express service to [[London]], including the [[Caledonian Sleeper]].\n\n== Accommodation ==\nThere are three hotels: the Kirkmichael Hotel, the Strathardle Inn and the Valhalla Lodge. The Kirkmichael Hotel was originally a large coaching inn but is now partly converted to holiday flats with the remaining part operating as a small hotel, restaurant and bar.  The Strathardle Inn was originally called the Aldchlappie Hotel, after the Allt Chlappie burn, which runs nearby. Its name was changed in the late 1990s and it now operates as a resident-only establishment.\n\nThe Valhalla Lodge opened in 1968 as The Edelweiss and quickly became popular as a nightspot and skiing base.  Concentrating on the skiing and holiday market in the 1980s, the name was changed to The Log Cabin, then in 2014 it became The Pinetrees Lodge. New owners in 2019 renamed it the Valhalla Bikers Lodge and it is now a popular place for bikers.\n\nKirkmichael offers a choice of self-catering properties, ranging from cottages to apartments and log cabins.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{commons category}}\n\n{{Perth & Kinross Towns & Villages}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kirkmichael, Perth And Kinross}}\n[[Category:Villages in Perth and Kinross]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2019}}\n{{Infobox UK place\n | country= Scotland\n | official_name= Kirkmichael\n | gaelic_name = Cill Mh\u00eccheil\n | population= 150\n | population_ref= \n | os_grid_reference= \n | coordinates = {{coord|56.724|-3.505|display=inline,title}}\n | scots_name= \n | unitary_scotland= [[Perth and Kinross]]\n | lieutenancy_scotland= [[Perth and Kinross]]\n | constituency_westminster= \n | constituency_scottish_parliament= \n | post_town= PERTH\n | postcode_district= PH10\n | postcode_area = PH\n | dial_code= 01250\n | static_image= Kirkmichael from the north-east.jpg\n | static_image_caption= Kirkmichael seen from the north-east\n | london_distance= {{convert|487|mi|km}}\n | edinburgh_distance= {{convert|72|mi|km}}\n}}\n\n'''Kirkmichael''' is a village located in [[Strathardle]], [[Perth and Kinross]], Scotland.

Its existence and success owe much to the foresight and tenacity of the parish minister in the 1990s, the Reverend Dr Hugh Ormiston.  Originally the parish school, it was latterly used as a vestry and Sunday School, and was in poor condition before its restoration into the well-equipped building of today.\n\n=== Village shop===\nThe village shop is run by a community-interest company, with local unpaid directors, and incorporates a coffee shop. The adjacent workshop is home to Milford Vintage Engineering, who specialise in the service, maintenance, repair and restoration of vintage and veteran vehicles. The building was erected in 1958 on the site of the disused blacksmith's smithy and garden ground as a sales and repair garage and the shop occupies the former showroom area. At one time Kirkmichael had four shops: one in the house at the school end of Williamston, which closed in the early 20th century, and three in Main Street. One was in the white building now known as MacDonald Cottage. It closed in 1983. The two others were side by side in the three-storey building opposite the present shop.\n\n=== Village hall ===\nThe village hall was opened in 1934 after a period of intense fundraising and is managed by a committee of volunteers. It is used by various local groups including [[Brownies (Scouting)|Brownies]], [[Girl guides|Guides]], [[Cub scouts|Cubs]], martial arts and keep fit, the primary school for Physical Education classes and is home to local functions. It was comprehensively modernised and refurbished in 2018/2019.\n\nMasonic Lodge Strathardle was restarted in the late 1950s after many years in abeyance and was originally located in the east end of the property known as Meadowside. When Meadowside changed hands about ten years later, the Lodge relocated to the annexe of the village hall.\n\n=== Fire station ===\nThe fire station - the third iteration, built in the 1990s - is manned by a part-time crew with a modern appliance.  The original 1960s station was a wooden hut adjacent to Riverview containing equipment and a trailer pump with Kirkmichael Garage providing a towing vehicle as required.  The second station was on the present site in Bannerfield and was a basic Nissen Hut shed housing a Karrier Gamecock appliance but with no crew facilities.  The current station is fitted and equipped to a high standard with office and training facilities.\n\n=== Bannerfield ===\nBannerfield, where the [[Earl of Mar]] raised the standard for the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] rising of [[1715 rising|1715]], provides car parking, recycling facilities and a riverside picnic area.   It is also used for the annual Srathardle Gathering Highland Games.\n\n== Historical monuments and memorials ==\n[[File:James Small Mounument - Scotland.jpg|thumb|right|The James Small Monument]]\n\n=== The War Memorial ===\nThe War Memorial which was erected after World War One sits above the road between the village and the Strathardle Inn. It is sadly neglected and overgrown and the panoramic views it once provided over Kirkmichael are now blocked by trees.\n\n=== The Small Monument ===\nAt the junction of the A924/B950 sits the [[James Small (Scottish laird)|James Small]] (1835\u20131900) of [[Dirnanean House|Dirnanean]] monument, a highly-ornate [[Celtic cross]] erected in honour of a former [[Deputy Lieutenant]] of [[Perthshire]].\n\n=== Whitefield Castle ===\nOff the footpath from the village to [[Glenshee]] lies [[Whitefield Castle]], a ruined hunting lodge built by King Malcolm Canmore in the 11th century.  It is well preserved,  considering it has had no restoration, and can be clearly seen from the road past the cemetery and the Glen Derby road.\n\n=== The Minister's Well ===\nThe old roadside [[water well]] opposite the church is fed by an underground spring which never runs dry.\n\n== The Games ==\n[http://www.strathardle.org Strathardle Highland Gathering & Agricultural Show] is held annually in Kirkmichael on the fourth Saturday of August. The Gathering is currently held in Bannerfield with the Agricultural Show in the adjacent field.  Known locally as \"the Games\", the highlights of the day include:\n* agricultural show with various livestock classes.\n* home industries tent\n* vintage vehicles\n* trade stands\n* [[pipe band]]\n* Highland dancing and piping competitions\n* track and heavy events\n* open [[Tug of war|tug'o'war]]\n* a musical cars event - similar to [[musical chairs]] but involving cars driving round the ring\n* funfair\n* food\n* stalls\n\nThe Gathering started in 1871 and has been held annually, apart from the inter-war years of 1914-18 and 1940-45. Locations included Croft of Dounie, Aldchlappie and Dalnagairn before settling on the current Bannerfield location in the late 1940s.\n\nThe founders of the original games were Alexander Petrie of [[Strathgarry]], [[Killiecrankie]] (originally of [[Ballinloan]], Kirkmichael), \"Mr Michie\" of [[Cluneskea]], [[Enochdhu]], \"Mr James Stewart\" and \"Mr James Dow\".  It is recorded that Petrie et al approached [[James Small (Scottish laird)|James Small]] of [[Dirnanean]] with a proposal to hold an annual gathering, a proposal to which Small gave his \"warm approval\".  Petrie himself subsequently competed in the games of his own founding, principally via \"titling the ring\" on horseback.<ref name=\"The People's Journal\">{{cite news |title=Atholl Farmer's Retiral. |periodical=[[The People's Journal]] |date=24 October 1936 |page=10}}</ref>\n\nThe agricultural show started in the late 1950s and now attracts a large entry of quality livestock.  For over a century, three generations of the Evans family from Glasgow attended the Gathering with their travelling funfair and sideshows and \"Evans shows\", as they were known, were an integral part of the Games and of village life.  In the 1950s and 1960s the fair stayed for two weeks and attracted large crowds with bingo, slot machines and shooting the main attractions. The Evans made their last visit in 2009.\n\n== The Glen ==\nKirkmichael is the largest village in [[Strathardle]]. Known locally as \"the glen\", the [[strath]] runs for 13 miles from [[Glen Brerachean]] on the Moulin Moors to the confluence of the River Ardle and the Blackwater just east of [[Bridge of Cally]].  The Ardle starts opposite the road to Glenfernate, where the Brerachean and the Fernate meet, and is bridged at Enochdhu, Kirkmichael, Pitcarmick, Dalnabreck, Ballintuim, Blackcraig, Cally Lodge and Bridge of Cally. The bridge to Blackcraig is of architectural significance as it has a house built over it.  The house on the bridge is one of the glen's best kept secrets. Strathardle is named after a Pictish warrior called Ardle who was killed at Enochdhu in a battle with the [[Danish people|Danes]] in the 12th century. His burial mound in the grounds of Dirnanean Lodge is over twelve feet long but whether he was a giant as reputed or had another warrior buried at his feet is unknown.\n\nPublic transport connects Kirkmichael with [[Blairgowrie and Rattray|Blairgowrie]], Tarvie and [[Spittal of Glenshee]]. The nearest railway station is [[Pitlochry railway station]] (12 miles), from where there is direct express service to [[London]], including the [[Caledonian Sleeper]].\n\n== Accommodation ==\nThere are three hotels: the Kirkmichael Hotel, the Strathardle Inn and the Valhalla Lodge. The Kirkmichael Hotel was originally a large coaching inn but is now partly converted to holiday flats with the remaining part operating as a small hotel, restaurant and bar.  The Strathardle Inn was originally called the Aldchlappie Hotel, after the Allt Chlappie burn, which runs nearby. Its name was changed in the late 1990s and it now operates as a resident-only establishment.\n\nThe Valhalla Lodge opened in 1968 as The Edelweiss and quickly became popular as a nightspot and skiing base.  Concentrating on the skiing and holiday market in the 1980s, the name was changed to The Log Cabin, then in 2014 it became The Pinetrees Lodge. New owners in 2019 renamed it the Valhalla Bikers Lodge and it is now a popular place for bikers.\n\nKirkmichael offers a choice of self-catering properties, ranging from cottages to apartments and log cabins.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{commons category}}\n\n{{Perth & Kinross Towns & Villages}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kirkmichael, Perth And Kinross}}\n[[Category:Villages in Perth and Kinross]]\n", "name_user": "Seasider53", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirkmichael,_Perth_and_Kinross"}

It became known on popular South Korean, male dominant online communities such as [[Ilbe Storehouse|Ilbe Storage (Ilbe)]] and the erotic gallery and study gallery of dcinside.\n\n===\"nth room\"===\nSomeone with the nickname \"God God\" created the \"1st room\" up to the \"8th room\" (nicknamed \"nth room\"), and uploaded pornography of sexual exploitation. Someone with the nickname \"watchman\" uploaded that link and allowed it to be accessed in a Telegram room called \"Gotham room\". However nth room disappeared in September 2019, and other rooms appeared instead.\n\n===\"Doctor's room\"===\nIt is true that Nth room started first, but it is more bizarre, the magnitude of the damage and the number of victims is much larger, and the place where the crime was conducted is the Doctor's room. One fact is that 16 of the officially known victims were minors, including middle school students.{{citation needed span|date=March 2020|along with the fact that there are 30,000 paid members who traded those videos.}} In Doctor's room, sexually exploitative pornography was distributed via a Telegram chatroom, and was only accessible by crypto-currency payment. \"Doctor\", who appeared in July 2019, threatened women, and took sadistic pictures and videos by figuring out their personal information, and then uploaded these pictures and videos. When reports first started, Doctor even figured out the personal information of the reporter, and circulated it. In addition, a high school student in Incheon was running various Telegram chatting rooms that distributed child pornography and links for buying drugs, and even shared tricks for dealing with police investigations.\n\n===Copycat crime===\nnth room gave birth to a Doctor's room that mimics it, and other copycat crimes are occurring.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.kbs.co.kr/news/view.do?ncd=4404749|title=N\ubc88\ubc29 \uc720\ub825 \uc6b4\uc601\uc790 \uac80\uac70\ub41c \uc640\uc911\uc5d0\ub3c4\u2026\u201c\uc81c2\u00b7\uc81c3 N\ubc88\ubc29 \uc5ec\uc804\u201d|website=KBS \ub274\uc2a4|language=ko|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20200324176800062|title='\uac13\uac13' \ubaa8\ubc29 '\uc81c2n\ubc88\ubc29' \uc6b4\uc601\uc790 \ub610 \uc788\ub2e4\u2026\ub2c9\ub124\uc784 '\ub85c\ub9ac\ub300\uc7a5\ud0dc\ubc94'|last=\uc774\uc7ac\ud604|date=2020-03-24|website=\uc5f0\ud569\ub274\uc2a4|language=ko|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref>\n\n==Reports and investigation==\nIn the beginning, when the case became known on male-dominated online communities, Jaesoo Kim (fictitious name) reported the nth room case by contacting 112 (number for police). However, police did not view it as a credible report, and ignored it.\n\nIn January 2019, the ''[[Seoul Shinmun]]'' found out by conducting undercover journalism that there was a secret Telegram room that was distributing child pornography, and to this point has not revealed the substance of the case. In the same manner, in April 2019, ''Sisa Journal'' reported that Telegram was being used as a platform for crime, in sharing illegal pictures and videos. On August 12, the ''Electronic Times'' was the first press outlet to report nth room. Thus, this case has brought huge social impact and public fury.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20200323002900315|title=Sex crime chat room ignites public fury|date=Mar 23, 2020|work=|access-date=|url-status=live|agency=Yonhap News Agency|location=Seoul}}</ref>\n\nRepresentative operator Baksa was arrested and released,<ref name=\"bbc20200325\"/> but his accomplice and Telegram users who share these videos trade for money are still unknown.

The suspect is Cho Joo-bin, born in 1995; this is the first case where an official identity disclosure measure has been taken for a sexual criminal. It has been revealed that Cho Joo-bin graduated from a technical college in Incheon, and was a reporter for the university newspaper. It is also suspected that he was active as a ilbe member, although this has not been confirmed.\n\nMeanwhile, the user with the nickname \"watchman\" who was known as the mastermind and the individual who made nth room popular was arrested in September 2019.  He was revealed as Mr. Jeon, a 38 year-old company worker, who had received a suspended sentence for pornography distribution in the past. Mr. Jeon was indicted on suspicion of operating an Internet site featuring illegal recordings, and a sentence of imprisonment of 3 years 6 months was sought by the prosecution. However, since it was revealed during the trial that there is a connection with nth room, an application is underway for resumption of hearings.\n\nMr. Shin, the prior operator of nth room, who had inherited it from \"God God\" was a male in his 30s, who had previously received a suspended sentence for violating the Act on the Protection of Children and Youth Against Sex Offenses, and was taken into police custody in September 2019. He received a sentence of one year imprisonment in the first hearing, and since the prosecution did not appeal, it is anticipated that this sentence will become final in the second hearing.\n\n== Reactions ==\n{{prose|section|date=March 2020}}\n\n=== Politics ===\n[[Lee In-young]], the parliamentary leader of the ruling [[Democratic Party of Korea]], promised the party will bring the case to parliament.<ref>{{cite news |last= |first= |date= 11 February 2020|title= \ubbfc\uc8fc\ub2f9 \"\ud154\ub808\uadf8\ub7a8 N\ubc88\ubc29 \uc0ac\uac74 \uc785\ubc95, \uad6d\ubbfc\uaed8 \uc57d\uc18d\"|url= https://www.sedaily.com/NewsView/1YYVR5RBQD|work=Seoul Economic Daily  |location= |access-date= 24 March 2020|author=HA Ellena (\ud558\uc815\uc5f0)|lang=Korean}}</ref>\nThe main opposition [[United Future Party]] condemned the case, in which they will forward the case to parliament to prohibits any kind of child pornography.<ref name=\"ufp\">{{cite news |last= |first= |date= 20 March 2020|title= [\ud3ec\ud1a0] \u201c\uc131\ucc29\ucde8 N\ubc88\ubc29 \ucc98\ubc8c \ubbf8\ub798\ud1b5\ud569\ub2f9\uc774 \uc55e\uc7a5\u201d|url= http://www.womennews.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=197364|work=The Women's News |location= |access-date= 24 March 2020|author=HONG Suhyeong (\ud64d\uc218\ud615)|lang=Korean}}</ref> The party also urged the Democratic Party to not just focus on the [[2020 South Korean legislative election|upcoming general election]] but also cooperate with them to forward their bill.<ref name=\"ufp\"/> Its chairman, [[Hwang Kyo-ahn]], however, created controversy by saying not all suspects involved in the case deserved the same punishment.\n\n== Expert opinion ==\nFor preventing recurrence and resolving this case, experts{{who|date=March 2020}} have indicated that the following is necessary.

It became known on popular South Korean, male dominant online communities such as [[Ilbe Storehouse|Ilbe Storage (Ilbe)]] and the erotic gallery and study gallery of dcinside.\n\n===\"nth room\"===\nSomeone with the nickname \"God God\" created the \"1st room\" up to the \"8th room\" (nicknamed \"nth room\"), and uploaded pornography of sexual exploitation. Someone with the nickname \"watchman\" uploaded that link and allowed it to be accessed in a Telegram room called \"Gotham room\". However nth room disappeared in September 2019, and other rooms appeared instead.\n\n===\"Doctor's room\"===\nIt is true that Nth room started first, but it is more bizarre, the magnitude of the damage and the number of victims is much larger, and the place where the crime was conducted is the Doctor's room. One fact is that 16 of the officially known victims were minors, including middle school students.{{citation needed span|date=March 2020|along with the fact that there are 30,000 paid members who traded those videos.}} In Doctor's room, sexually exploitative pornography was distributed via a Telegram chatroom, and was only accessible by crypto-currency payment. \"Doctor\", who appeared in July 2019, threatened women, and took sadistic pictures and videos by figuring out their personal information, and then uploaded these pictures and videos. When reports first started, Doctor even figured out the personal information of the reporter, and circulated it. In addition, a high school student in Incheon was running various Telegram chatting rooms that distributed child pornography and links for buying drugs, and even shared tricks for dealing with police investigations.\n\n===Copycat crime===\nnth room gave birth to a Doctor's room that mimics it, and other copycat crimes are occurring.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.kbs.co.kr/news/view.do?ncd=4404749|title=N\ubc88\ubc29 \uc720\ub825 \uc6b4\uc601\uc790 \uac80\uac70\ub41c \uc640\uc911\uc5d0\ub3c4\u2026\u201c\uc81c2\u00b7\uc81c3 N\ubc88\ubc29 \uc5ec\uc804\u201d|website=KBS \ub274\uc2a4|language=ko|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20200324176800062|title='\uac13\uac13' \ubaa8\ubc29 '\uc81c2n\ubc88\ubc29' \uc6b4\uc601\uc790 \ub610 \uc788\ub2e4\u2026\ub2c9\ub124\uc784 '\ub85c\ub9ac\ub300\uc7a5\ud0dc\ubc94'|last=\uc774\uc7ac\ud604|date=2020-03-24|website=\uc5f0\ud569\ub274\uc2a4|language=ko|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref>\n\n==Reports and investigation==\nIn the beginning, when the case became known on male-dominated online communities, Jaesoo Kim (fictitious name) reported the nth room case by contacting 112 (number for police). However, police did not view it as a credible report, and ignored it.\n\nIn January 2019, the ''[[Seoul Shinmun]]'' found out by conducting undercover journalism that there was a secret Telegram room that was distributing child pornography, and to this point has not revealed the substance of the case. In the same manner, in April 2019, ''Sisa Journal'' reported that Telegram was being used as a platform for crime, in sharing illegal pictures and videos. On August 12, the ''Electronic Times'' was the first press outlet to report nth room. Thus, this case has brought huge social impact and public fury.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20200323002900315|title=Sex crime chat room ignites public fury|date=Mar 23, 2020|work=|access-date=|url-status=live|agency=Yonhap News Agency|location=Seoul}}</ref>\n\nRepresentative operator Baksa was arrested and released,<ref name=\"bbc20200325\"/> but his accomplice and Telegram users who share these videos trade for money are still unknown.

The suspect is Cho Joo-bin, born in 1995; this is the first case where an official identity disclosure measure has been taken for a sexual criminal. It has been revealed that Cho Joo-bin graduated from a technical college in Incheon, and was a reporter for the university newspaper. It is also suspected that he was active as a ilbe member, although this has not been confirmed.\n\nMeanwhile, the user with the nickname \"watchman\" who was known as the mastermind and the individual who made nth room popular was arrested in September 2019.  He was revealed as Mr. Jeon, a 38 year-old company worker, who had received a suspended sentence for pornography distribution in the past. Mr. Jeon was indicted on suspicion of operating an Internet site featuring illegal recordings, and a sentence of imprisonment of 3 years 6 months was sought by the prosecution. However, since it was revealed during the trial that there is a connection with nth room, an application is underway for resumption of hearings.\n\nMr. Shin, the prior operator of nth room, who had inherited it from \"God God\" was a male in his 30s, who had previously received a suspended sentence for violating the Act on the Protection of Children and Youth Against Sex Offenses, and was taken into police custody in September 2019. He received a sentence of one year imprisonment in the first hearing, and since the prosecution did not appeal, it is anticipated that this sentence will become final in the second hearing.\n\n== Reactions ==\n{{prose|section|date=March 2020}}\n\n=== Politics ===\n[[Lee In-young]], the parliamentary leader of the ruling [[Democratic Party of Korea]], promised the party will bring the case to parliament.<ref>{{cite news |last= |first= |date= 11 February 2020|title= \ubbfc\uc8fc\ub2f9 \"\ud154\ub808\uadf8\ub7a8 N\ubc88\ubc29 \uc0ac\uac74 \uc785\ubc95, \uad6d\ubbfc\uaed8 \uc57d\uc18d\"|url= https://www.sedaily.com/NewsView/1YYVR5RBQD|work=Seoul Economic Daily  |location= |access-date= 24 March 2020|author=HA Ellena (\ud558\uc815\uc5f0)|lang=Korean}}</ref>\nThe main opposition [[United Future Party]] condemned the case, in which they will forward the case to parliament to prohibits any kind of child pornography.<ref name=\"ufp\">{{cite news |last= |first= |date= 20 March 2020|title= [\ud3ec\ud1a0] \u201c\uc131\ucc29\ucde8 N\ubc88\ubc29 \ucc98\ubc8c \ubbf8\ub798\ud1b5\ud569\ub2f9\uc774 \uc55e\uc7a5\u201d|url= http://www.womennews.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=197364|work=The Women's News |location= |access-date= 24 March 2020|author=HONG Suhyeong (\ud64d\uc218\ud615)|lang=Korean}}</ref> The party also urged the Democratic Party to not just focus on the [[2020 South Korean legislative election|upcoming general election]] but also cooperate with them to forward their bill.<ref name=\"ufp\"/> Its chairman, [[Hwang Kyo-ahn]], however, created controversy by saying not all suspects involved in the case deserved the same punishment.\n\n== Expert opinion ==\nFor preventing recurrence and resolving this case, experts{{who|date=March 2020}} have indicated that the following is necessary. First, request the active international cooperation of governments. Second, establish a dedicated department for digital sexual crimes. Third, build a strong system for strengthening the weighing of offenses, and confiscating the proceeds of crime. Fourth, permitting sting investigations. Fifth, punishing the platforms. Opinions were presented that it is necessary to introduce new concepts and crime names of \"digital group sexual violence\" and \"sexual exploitation\".{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source.
