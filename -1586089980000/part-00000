The game is chronologically the sixth installment in the ''[[Persona (series)|Persona]]'' series, which is part of the larger ''[[Megami Tensei]]'' franchise. It was released for the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[PlayStation 4]] in Japan in September 2016 and worldwide in April 2017. It was published by Atlus in Japan and North America and by [[Deep Silver]] in Europe and Australia. An expanded version featuring new content, '''''Persona 5 Royal''''',{{efn|Known as ''Persona 5: The Royal'' {{nihongo||\u30da\u30eb\u30bd\u30ca5 \u30b6\u30fb\u30ed\u30a4\u30e4\u30eb|Perusona Faibu Za Roiyaru}} in Japanese}} was released in Japan in October 2019 and worldwide in March 2020.\n\n''Persona 5'' takes place in modern-day [[Tokyo]] and follows [[Joker (Persona)|Joker]] after his transfer to Shujin Academy due to being put on probation for an assault of which he was falsely accused. During a school year, he and other students awaken to special powers, becoming a group of secret [[vigilante]]s known as the [[Phantom Thieves of Hearts]]. They explore the Metaverse, a supernatural realm born from humanity's subconscious desires, to steal malevolent intent from the hearts of adults. As with previous games in the series, the party battles enemies known as Shadows using physical manifestations of their psyche known as the [[Persona (series)#Personas|Persona]]. The game incorporates role-playing and [[dungeon crawl]]ing elements alongside [[Social simulation game|social simulation]] scenarios.\n\n''Persona 5'' was developed by P-Studio, an internal development studio within Atlus led by game director and producer [[Katsura Hashino]]. Along with Hashino, returning staff from earlier ''Persona'' games included character designer [[Shigenori Soejima]] and music composer [[Shoji Meguro]]. Preparatory work began during the development of ''[[Persona 4]]'', with full development beginning after the release of ''[[Catherine (video game)|Catherine]]'' in 2011. First announced in 2013, ''Persona 5'' was delayed from its original late 2014 release date due to the game not being fully finished. The game's themes revolved around attaining freedom from the limitations of modern society, while its story was strongly inspired by [[picaresque fiction]] and the party's Personas being based on well-known literary outlaws and rebels.\n\n''Persona 5'' was met with critical acclaim, with praise given to its visual presentation and art direction, cast, gameplay, and music. The game is considered to be one of the greatest role-playing games of all time and was nominated for and won multiple awards. The game shipped over three million copies worldwide by the end of 2019, making it the best-selling entry in the overall ''Megami Tensei'' franchise. Several other media, including two spin-off games, ''[[Persona 5: Dancing in Starlight]]'' and ''[[Persona 5 Scramble]]'', as well as manga and [[Persona 5: The Animation|anime adaptations]], have also been released. The game's cast has also made appearances in other games, such as Joker appearing as a playable character in the 2018 crossover fighting game ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]''.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n{{See also|Persona (series)#Gameplay|l1=Gameplay of the Persona series}}\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = vertical\n| footer = [[Joker (Persona)|Joker]], the game's protagonist, has two alternating lifestyles: a normal student life ''(top)'', and adventures into otherworldly locations ''(bottom)''.\n| image1 = Persona 5 Classroom.jpg\n| width1 = 250\n| image2 = Persona 5 Palace Combat.jpg\n| width2 = 250\n}}\n''Persona 5'' is a [[role-playing video game]] where the player takes on the role of a high school student, codenamed [[Joker (Persona)|Joker]], who lives out a single year while attending school in modern-day [[Tokyo]]. The game is governed by a day-night cycle and weather systems that determine general behavior similar to a [[social simulation game]]. The year is punctuated by both scripted and random events as Joker attends school. He can perform part-time jobs and pursue leisure activities or create battle items. These various activities raise character attributes, which grant passive [[Status effect#Buffs|buffing]] effects during battle.<ref name=\"RPGgameplay\"/><ref name=\"GemCharactersB\"/><ref name=\"P5FamGameplay\"/><ref name=\"PolyGameplay\"/> When in the real world, the main protagonist can develop character relationships known as ''Confidants''; an evolution of the ''Social Link'' system from ''[[Persona 3]]'' and ''[[Persona 4]]''. With this system, the main protagonist can converse with and improve his relationship with other characters he meets, with some leading to possible romances. Improving Confidant ranks with [[Party (role-playing games)|party]] members unlocks various abilities for use in combat, such as the \"Baton Pass\" ability, which allows the player to directly select another character after a critical hit while granting a temporary attack boost.<ref name=\"P5FamGameplay\"/> Improving ranks with non-party Confidants grant other bonuses, such as giving access to new [[Item (gaming)|items]] and equipment and boosting [[experience point]] and yen gain.<ref name=\"P5FamGameplay\"/>\n\nAlongside the normal school life is [[dungeon crawl]]ing gameplay of two different types within a realm called the Metaverse: story-specific dungeons called Palaces and randomly-generated Mementos dungeons. Both are populated by Shadows, physical manifestations of suppressed psyches that are modeled after mythological and religious figures. Within Mementos dungeons, the party can fulfill requests from [[non-playable character]]s (NPCs) received from a \"Confidant\" links.<ref name=\"RPGgameplay\"/><ref name=\"P5FamGameplay\"/><ref name=\"PolyGameplay\"/><ref name=\"SilGameplayPersonas\"/> While navigating, the party uses stealth to avoid the sight of enemy Shadows, and some areas hold puzzles that can be solved using an insight ability known as \"Third Eye\",<ref name=\"P5FamBattle\"/> which highlights interactable objects and enemy strength compared to the party. When exploring story-centered Palaces, an \"Alertness Meter\" is present, where the party being spotted or fleeing combat results in security being raised. If security reaches 100%, the party is forced to leave the Palace. The Alertness level can be lowered by launching surprise attacks on and eliminating enemies, and also lowers automatically overnight.<ref name=\"P5gameplayBits\"/> Throughout Palaces are locations known as \"safe rooms\". In them, the player can [[Saved game|save their game]], heal their party, and [[fast travel]] to other safe rooms within the Palace.\n\nAs with previous entries in the series, the game uses a [[Turns, rounds and time-keeping systems in games#Turn-based|turn-based]] combat system: battles can be initiated when the party runs into an enemy, or they can launch a surprise attack and gain an advantage in battle. In battle, the party has access to both melee and gun weapons, in addition to being able to summon Personas, manifestations of the main characters' inner psyche used mainly for special attacks.<ref name=\"PolyGameplay\"/><ref name=\"P5FamBattle\"/><ref name=\"GemDetails\"/><ref name=\"GemDetails\"/><ref name=\"ShackMasks\">{{cite web |url=https://www.gamexeed.com/2020/03/persona-5-royal-new-ps4-game-2020.html |title=Persona 5 Royal New PS4 Game 2020?? |last=Teja|first=Ravi |publisher=Raviteja|date=March 4, 2020 |accessdate=March 4, 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160830213249/https://www.gamexeed.com/2020/03/persona-5-royal-new-ps4-game-2020.html |archivedate=March 4, 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"ShackMasks\"/> If a character strikes an enemy's weakness, they knock the enemy down and are awarded an additional turn. If all enemies are knocked down, a \"Hold Up\" is triggered. During one, the party can launch a devastating \"All-Out Attack\", demand money or items, or enter a negotiation. Negotiation allows Joker to win the selected Shadow over to their side to become a new Persona: they can only be persuaded to join if Joker is their level or higher.<ref name=\"RPGgameplay\"/><ref name=\"PolyGameplay\"/><ref name=\"DigiGameplay\"/> Similar to previous entries, party members can be knocked out, and if the main character is knocked out, the game ends. At times, if a party member is knocked out, they can be captured by enemy Shadows, and is unable to return to the party if the resultant negotiation fails.<ref name=\"P5gameplayBits\"/>\n\nNew Personas are gained from battle through successful negotiation, and different Persona types are represented through different arcana linked to Confidant links. Personas can be combined, or \"fused\", or otherwise further manipulated within the Velvet Room, a realm Joker visits as part of his journey through the story.<ref name=\"SilGameplayPersonas\"/><ref name=\"PSeriesInfo\"/> In the Velvet Room, Personas can be fused with \"Guillotine\" fusion processes, with the resultant Persona inheriting skills and stats from its parents. The more skills a Persona has, the more are passed on to the fused Persona. How powerful Personas are through fusion depends on how advanced its associated Confidant link is. Also, Personas can be sacrificed in various ways, also styled after styles of capital punishment: \"Hanging\" grants a sacrificed Persona's experience points to another chosen Persona, and \"Electric Chair\" sacrifice one to create a high-end item. A Persona can also be sent into \"Solitary Confinement\", where they undergo intensive training and gain additional skills quicker than normal. The number of days a Persona must remain to gain strength lessens based on its arcana strength.<ref name=\"SilGameplayPersonas\"/>\n\nMinor multiplayer elements are incorporated into the game through the \"Thieves Guild\" feature. Similar to the \"Vox Populi\" system from ''Persona 4 Golden'', players have the option of seeing what activities other players did during any given day. Players can send messages to each other, in addition to affecting the Alertness meter in the player's favor, and aiding in battle when a party member is taken hostage by an enemy.<ref name=\"P5FamGameplay\"/><ref name=\"P5gameplayBits\"/>\n\n==Synopsis==\n===Setting and characters===\n{{Main Article|List of Persona 5 characters}}\n''Persona 5'' takes place within the ''Persona'' universe, revolving around a group of high school students who harness Personas, physical manifestations of their inner psyche.<ref name=\"GIpersona\"/> ''Persona 5'' is set in modern-day Tokyo, in April of the year \"20XX\", with navigable real-world locations within the city including [[Akihabara]], [[Shinjuku]] and [[Shibuya]].<ref name=\"P5year\"/> Alongside larger environments, there are specific locations that can be entered, such as shops, restaurants and movie theaters. A major setting throughout the game is Shujin Academy, a high school that the protagonist attends.<ref name=\"GemCharactersB\"/><ref name=\"FamTokyo\"/><ref name=\"GemCharactersA\"/> The second major location is the \"Metaverse\", a supernatural realm consisting of the physical manifestation of humanity's subconscious desires. In the Metaverse, people with corrupted enough desires form their own unique \"Palace\", which is modeled after their distorted perception of the world, along with a Shadow version of themselves possessing a \"Treasure\" symbolic of their desires.<ref name=\"FamTokyo\"/><ref name=\"P5persona\"/><ref name=\"PMythDetail\"/> Returning from earlier entries is the Velvet Room, a place that exists for the growth of Persona users that shifts appearance depending on the current guest: in ''Persona 5'', it takes the form of a prison.<ref name=\"PSeriesInfo\"/>\n\nThe [[player character]] is a [[silent protagonist]], a commonplace feature in other ''Persona'' games, codenamed [[Joker (Persona)|Joker]]. He becomes the leader of a [[vigilante]] group known as the Phantom Thieves of Hearts, who change the hearts of criminals and other malevolent people through the Metaverse.<ref name=\"GemCharactersA\"/><ref name=\"GIinterview\"/> He forms it with Morgana, a mysterious cat-like creature who serves as the Thieves' second-in-command, who wants to discover his origins and restore his true form. Other founding members include school delinquent Ryuji Sakamoto and fashion model Ann Takamaki. More people join the group throughout the game, including art prodigy Yusuke Kitagawa, student council president [[Makoto Niijima]], [[hikikomori]] computer hacker Futaba Sakura, and cultured corporate heiress Haru Okumura.<ref name=\"GemCharactersB\"/><ref name=\"GemCharactersA\"/><ref name=\"GIinterview\"/> Also interacting with Joker are Goro Akechi, a high school detective; Sae Niijima, public prosecutor and Makoto's older sister; and the residents of the Velvet Room, Igor and his two assistants Caroline and Justine.<ref name=\"GemCharactersB\"/><ref name=\"KotakuLysis\"/> Joker also has interactions with other confidants, including his caretaker and Futaba's adoptive father Sojiro Sakura, classmate Yuuki Mishima, his teacher and part-time maid Sadayo Kawakami, arcade gamer Shinya Oda, journalist Ichiko Ohya, [[fortune teller]] Chihaya Mifune, [[shogi]] master Hifumi Togo, doctor Tae Takemi, politician Toranosuke Yoshida, and [[model gun]] store owner Munehisa Iwai.\n\n===Plot===\nAfter Joker defends a woman from being abused by a drunken man on the street, he is falsely charged with assault and put on [[probation]], resulting in expulsion from his school. Joker is sent to Tokyo to stay with his family associate Sojiro Sakura and attend Shujin Academy during his year-long probation. After his arrival, he is drawn into the Velvet Room, where Igor warns him that he must \"rehabilitate\" to avoid forthcoming ruin, and grants him access to a supernatural mobile app that leads Joker into the Metaverse and the Palace of the school's abusive volleyball coach Suguru Kamoshida. Joker meets Morgana, who informs him of the ability to change wicked people's hearts by stealing their \"Treasure\", the emotional root of their behavior, from the Palaces ruled by their Shadow selves. After successfully reforming Kamoshida, Ryuji, Joker, Ann, and Morgana form the Phantom Thieves of Hearts, stealing corruption from the hearts of adults to reform the city.\n\nAs the number of the Phantom Thieves' members and successes grows, they attract the attention of the public and police, including public prosecutor Sae Niijima and detective prodigy Goro Akechi. The Phantom Thieves learn that another secret group, including a black-masked assassin, is using the Metaverse to murder their targets and then framing the Phantom Thieves of Hearts for the killings. In pursuit of the conspiracy, the group is joined by Akechi, who is subsequently revealed to be the black-masked assassin. Escaping into hiding with Sae's help, the Phantom Thieves deduce that the conspiracy's leader is politician Masayoshi Shido, who has been using Akechi's ability to infiltrate the Metaverse to remove obstacles to his becoming Prime Minister and imposing his reforms on Japan, as well as the one who pressed assault charges against Joker. When the Phantom Thieves infiltrate Shido's Palace, they face Akechi, who reveals himself to be Shido's illegitimate son. He also reveals that he has been secretly plotting to exact his revenge on Shido for years of neglect and summons his true Persona: Loki. Once defeated, Akechi sacrifices himself to protect the Phantom Thieves from a group of enemies, allowing them to escape and reach Shido.\n\nDespite Shido's arrest and confession after his change of heart, the public remains uninterested and has lost trust in both authority and the Phantom Thieves. In response, the Phantom Thieves make a final heist to infiltrate the depths of Mementos and steal the treasure at its core. Inside, they discover that the public is in chaos and has chosen to give up their autonomy. The Phantom Thieves are then ejected from Mementos by the Treasure, taking form as the Holy Grail, and vanish after witnessing the Metaverse merge with reality. Waking in the Velvet Room, Joker confronts Igor, Caroline, and Justine. Caroline and Justine regain their memories and merge into Lavenza, their true form. Lavenza reveals the Igor Joker has been seeing in the Velvet room up until this point to be an imposter who imprisoned the real Igor. The imposter is then revealed to be [[Yaldabaoth]], the Holy Grail, who was created from humanity's wish to give up control. Through a bet made with Igor over humanity's goals, Yaldabaoth had given Joker and Akechi their abilities to see whether the world would be preserved or be destroyed through their actions, all while steering the game in his favor.\n\nJoker rejects Yaldabaoth's offer to return to his world at the cost of his freedom, and he, along with the rest of the Phantom Thieves, fight him. Joker's confidants rally the popular support of the people, rebelling against Yaldabaoth's control of humanity and allowing Joker to awaken his ultimate persona to destroy Yaldabaoth and the Metaverse. After Yaldabaoth's defeat, in order for Shido to be prosecuted, Joker must turn himself into the police. While Joker is incarcerated, the rest of the Phantom Thieves and his confidants successfully help secure evidence of Joker's innocence in the assault charge, leading to his conviction being overturned. By spring, Joker's friends drive him back to his hometown.\n\n===''Royal''===\nIn ''Persona 5 Royal'', two new characters interact with the Phantom Thieves: Kasumi Yoshizawa, an accomplished rhythmic gymnast who transferred to Shujin at the same time as the protagonist, and Takuto Maruki, a school counselor hired after Kamoshida is exposed. Kasumi awakens to her Persona after calling the protagonist to a new Palace in Odaiba that quickly vanishes. Maruki, in turn, talks to each of the Phantom Thieves, learning their deepest wishes. After defeating Yaldabaoth, the still-living Akechi turns himself over to Sae in the protagonist's place. At the beginning of the following year, the protagonist finds reality distorted; Akechi was released without reason, and each Phantom Thief member has had their deepest wish granted. The protagonist and Akechi, together with the also-aware Kasumi, return to the Odaiba Palace and investigate. The Palace's master is Maruki, who reveals that \"Kasumi\" is Sumire, sister to the original Kasumi, who died in a car accident saving Sumire.\n\nMaruki can use his Persona to alter a person's reality, with his first use of it being to make his then-girlfriend forget her parents' murder. Yaldabaoth's manipulation of the world drove Maruki and his Persona over the edge, and they became the new controllers of Mementos and warped all reality into a dream-like ideal. Sumire turns against the protagonist to protect her identity as \"Kasumi.\" The protagonist snaps his friends out of Maruki's reality, then frees Sumire from his influence. Depending on player choices, it is revealed that Akechi's survival is dependant on the new reality, and Maruki offers the protagonist the option of accepting it to save Akechi. Refusing the offer, the reformed Phantom Thieves, including Akechi and Sumire, defeat Maruki. Reality returns to normal, and with Akechi missing and the protagonist in prison.\n\nOn their final meeting after the protagonist's release, each member of the Phantom Thieves chooses to pursue their dreams within the current reality. On the day he is due to return home, the protagonist escapes tailing government agents with help from both the Phantom Thieves and a reformed Maruki. At the station, Sumire bids him farewell. If Akechi's confidant level is at its highest, and with the right dialogue choices, a man wearing Akechi's clothes is briefly seen passing through the train window that the protagonist is riding.\n\n==Development==\nThe game was developed by P-Studio, an internal development studio within Atlus dedicated to handling the ''Persona'' series. Preparatory development of the game began in 2008, following the release of ''[[Persona 4]]'', with full development beginning following the release of ''[[Catherine (video game)|Catherine]]'' in 2011.<ref name=\"KotakuPersonaA\"/><ref name=\"RPGSinterview\"/><ref name=\"AndriaPersonaA\"/><ref name=\"CGMagInterview\"/> Hashino was only fully involved in development after ''Catherine'' was finished, later calling the latter game a test for the next ''Persona'' game's development. Development lasted five years.<ref name=\"PersonaBlog\"/><ref name=\"4Gstory\"/> ''Persona 5'' would be Hashino's last game in the series as the leader of P-Studio, as he would afterwards form a separate internal team called Studio Zero.<ref name=\"P5studioA\"/><ref name=\"P5studioB\"/> When production started, the staff consisted of around 40 people. During full production, this number expanded to 70: 15 planners, 15 programmers, and between 30 and 45 designers. These included the game's lead designer Naoya Maeda, who had previously done modeling work for the ''[[Trauma Center (video game series)|Trauma Center]]'' series. The general development was a challenge for the team, as they intentionally changed their development structure due to the more powerful hardware they were working with.<ref name=\"CGMagInterview\"/>\n\nWhile the final game retained the turn-based system from earlier entries, one of the early design drafts was for an action-based system incorporating real-time elements foreign to the series. This idea was ultimately scrapped, but real-time command elements were introduced into the battle system, allowing the gameplay to evolve without extensive changes to the core system.<ref name=\"PSblogHashino\"/> A major new addition was the inclusions of unique dungeons with locked layouts as opposed to the dominant randomly generated dungeons of previous ''Persona'' games. This was done to both emulate the game's themes and provide veteran players with something different.<ref name=\"USGp5Interview\"/> A returning feature from both earlier ''Persona'' games and the mainline ''[[Megami Tensei]]'' series was Negotiation: as it was considered a key part of the overall franchise by fans, Hashino decided to reintroduce it after being absent from the previous two mainline entries. The Negotiation system for ''Persona 5'' was tied into the origins of Shadows as suppressed psyches within the Collective Unconscious. The \"Hold Up\" function was inspired by scenes in films where the antagonist would hold people at gunpoint and make demands. These functions were incorporated due to the game being in part a celebration of the series' history.<ref name=\"4Gstory\"/> While designing the gameplay elements, the weather, and environmental elements were all designed to reflect the real world. Dungeon layout was split into three distinct types: the Tokyo overworld environments, \"institutions\" such as Joker's high school, and dungeon environments.<ref name=\"CGMagInterview\"/> Some segments took control away from the player aside from limited dialogue choices; this was chosen as it reflected the controlled environment of Japanese high schoolers.<ref name=\"P5hashinoUI\"/>\n\nWhile ''Catherine'' used the third-party [[Gamebryo]] [[game engine]], ''Persona 5'' used a specially-created engine. Hashino believed that the new engine would make rendering their ideas much easier, although it would result in a long wait by fans for the game.<ref name=\"AndriaPersonaA\"/><ref name=\"CathBryon\"/> The event scene software was also developed internally by Atlus, with an estimated 1,160 being featured in the final game. The tools for developing and handling them were greatly expanded over the previous two entries to properly communicate them to players on the more advanced hardware.<ref name=\"CGMagInterview\"/> Character modeling, in general, was handled with a specially-developed toon shader which helped properly translate the character designs into the game, while also allowing for easy adjustment of shaders and lighting effects during fine-tuning.<ref name=\"CGMagInterview\"/> The characters were originally rendered realistically like in ''Catherine'', but the team felt that it was \"wrong\" for the ''Persona'' series. With this in mind, the team did some trial and error before finding a style that satisfied them, doing something similar for the interface and menu design.<ref name=\"P5magazine\"/> In contrast to ''Persona 4'', which had a general deformed look to hardware limitations on the variety of body shapes, the technology available to the team for ''Persona 5'' enabled unique customization for all relevant character models. Two different models were used for members of the main cast: a detailed model for real-time cutscenes, and a general-use model for general event scenes and gameplay.<ref name=\"CGMagInterview\"/> ''Persona 5'' was the first time a large number of Personas had been rendered in high definition, something which proved a grueling challenge for the team.<ref name=\"GemDetails\"/>\n\n===Story and themes===\nThe original story concept was written by Hashino, while the scenario was co-written by Shinji Yamamoto and Yuichiro Tanaka.<ref name=\"P5credits\"/><ref name=\"Persona5Maniacus\"/> The initial concept was for a storyline that diverged from the established paths of ''Persona 3'' and ''Persona 4'', with \"self-discovery\" and \"journey\" being its keywords.<ref name=\"PSblogHashino\"/> Originally using the concept of a [[Backpacking (travel)|backpacking trip]] around the world as a framing device for the story, Hashino decided to refocus on Japan in the wake of the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]].<ref name=\"4Gstory\"/> More specifically, it has been noted that the Japanese government's actions in response to the earthquake and tsunami's fallout, along with Japanese citizens' reactions to how the government acted during that time, may have served as partial influences on the game's themes.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.usgamer.net/articles/the-real-world-problems-behind-persona-5|title=The Real-World Problems Behind Persona 5|last=McCarthy|first=Caty|date=May 5, 2017|website=USgamer|language=en|access-date=June 29, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190603100720/https://www.usgamer.net/articles/the-real-world-problems-behind-persona-5|archive-date=June 3, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Following that crisis and seeing how people were bonding in the face of it, Hashino decided to have the story take place solely in Japan, with the journeying being done through the ever-shifting Palaces.<ref name=\"PSblogHashino\"/> Ultimately, the story's central concepts were inspired by equivalent social changes he saw in modern society, particularly in Japan.<ref name=\"PMythDetail\" /> Hashino also described the central theme of the game as being about freedom and how the characters attain it.<ref name=\"Persona5Theme\"/> He wanted to make the game more \"thematically approachable\" for newcomers to the series, and to be an emotional experience that left its audience with a strong sense of [[catharsis]] and the inspiration to take on problems in their lives.<ref name=\"Persona5Theme\"/><ref name=\"SilCath\"/>\n\nThe narrative of ''Persona 5'' was designed like an omnibus, with the antagonists pursued by the party changing regularly.<ref name=\"P5persona\"/> As inspiration, the development team has also cited three main stories: the Chinese novel ''[[Water Margin]]'', the Japanese crime movie ''Hakuchuu no Shikaku'', and the Spanish novel ''[[Lazarillo de Tormes]]''.<ref name=\"PMinspiration\"/> Furthermore, the setting and style was compared to a [[Picaresque novel|picaresque fiction]]; the team originally asked the question of how a character like [[Ars\u00e8ne Lupin III]] might win appeal in modern society.<ref name=\"GemHashino\"/> This picaresque theme was carried over into the aesthetics of Persona fusion and sacrifice, which were themed after styles of capital punishment.<ref name=\"SilGameplayPersonas\"/> Having a more \"stereotypical\" theme enabled the team to create surprising story developments, mixing contemporary drama with the setting of the ''Persona'' series. The series' recurring motif of \"masks\" was used more overtly in the game's plot than previous entries as well,<ref name=\"SilP5Fam\"/> and the game's main locations were based heavily on their real-world counterparts.<ref name=\"P5FamGameplay\"/>\n\nThe main characters, according to Hashino, share a mindset that they \"no longer have a place where they belong in society\": the events of the game give them a sense of belonging.<ref name=\"GIinterview\"/> Hashino stated that while the last few games were about the protagonists chasing the antagonists, ''Persona 5'' would instead more prominently feature the antagonists and phenomena caused by them chasing the protagonists during the latter's activities. The characters have been described as \"juvenile academics,\"<ref name=\"GemHashino\"/> with their activities as thieves being part of the way they break from societal norms and express themselves. Adhering with this concept, the game's main aim was to show the characters finding the courage to go outside the normal limits of society as set by previous generations.<ref name=\"GemHashino\"/> In contrast to previous ''Persona'' casts, the party of ''Persona 5'' willingly embrace the unfolding unusual events in their role of masked vigilantes rather than being dragged into them.<ref name=\"GIinterview\"/> The cast was originally going to be larger with character Hifumi Togo becoming a Phantom Thief, but as the story was already very large, she was relegated to an optional role as part of the Confidant system.<ref name=\"PSCsecrets\"/> Technological advances such as [[smartphones]] and the use of [[social media]] were integrated into both the story and gameplay due to their growing prevalence in modern society and how the public responds to real-world scandals.<ref name=\"P5hashinoUI\"/><ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThe characters' initial Personas ([[Ars\u00e8ne Lupin|Ars\u00e8ne]], [[William Kidd|Captain Kidd]], [[Carmen (novella)|Carmen]], [[Zorro]], [[Ishikawa Goemon|Goemon]], [[Pope Joan|Johanna]], [[Necronomicon]], [[Milady de Winter|Milady]], [[Robin Hood]]) were themed after outlaws and picaresque heroes to reflect the function and dominant suppressed passions forming the Palace, and also represent aspects of their owners' personalities.<ref name=\"GemCharactersB\"/><ref name=\"GemCharactersA\"/><ref name=\"P5persona\"/><ref name=\"GIinterview\"/><ref name=\"Persona5Artbook\"/> Joker's initial Persona was originally the German demon [[Mephistopheles]], but it was changed to Ars\u00e8ne as the latter character better fit the game's themes.<ref name=\"PSCsecrets\"/> The cast's alternate Personas ([[Satan]]ael, [[Sun Wukong|Seiten Taisei]], [[Hecate]], [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercurius]], [[Susano-o|Kamu Susanoo]], [[Anat]], [[Prometheus]], [[Astarte]], [[Loki]]) are taken from mythical beings who act as tricksters or rebels.<ref name=\"Persona5Maniacus\"/><ref name=\"Persona5Artbook\"/> The three main inspirations behind Joker's alter ego were [[Ars\u00e8ne Lupin]], [[The Fiend with Twenty Faces]], and Japanese outlaw hero Ishikawa Goemon.<ref name=\"PMinspiration\"/> The name of Joker's high school, \"Shujin\", was chosen because it was a [[homonym]] of {{nihongo|''Sh\u016bjin''|\u56da\u4eba}}, the Japanese word for \"prisoner\".<ref name=\"KotakuPersonaB\"/> Following a trend from earlier entries, the Velvet Room assistants are named after characters from the novel ''[[Frankenstein]]'' by [[Mary Shelley]].<ref name=\"PSeriesInfo\"/>\n\nThe use of adults as antagonists was a more overt expression of narrative elements previously explored in ''Persona 4''. The relation to police activities was also carried over from ''Persona 4'', but this time with the role of protagonists and antagonists reversed.<ref name=\"PSblogHashino\" /> Several writers have highlighted the parallels between the game's various antagonists and real incidents/figures in different sectors of Japanese society (e.g. political, corporate, academic), and how the game's story and characters serve as social commentary on life in Japan.<ref name=\":5\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2017-05-12/the-real-japan-behind-persona-5/.116021|title=The Real Japan Behind Persona 5|last=Gay|first=Elliot|date=May 12, 2017|website=Anime News Network|language=en|access-date=June 30, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190630013134/https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2017-05-12/the-real-japan-behind-persona-5/.116021|archive-date=June 30, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The game's villains and protagonists were also constructed to be parallels of each other, both groups being misfits trying to shape a world they saw as unsatisfactory or corrupted. This was intended to create moral ambiguity about the Phantom Thieves' actions, causing the player to question their concept of justice and their mission as a whole.<ref name=\"4Gstory\" /> In addition, the way a vocal minority online could draw attention to and shift public opinion on events and scandals in the news was cited as an inspiration for the ambiguous nature of the Phantom Thieves' actions.<ref name=\"USGp5Interview\" />\n\n===Art design===\n[[Shigenori Soejima]], who had worked on the last two main-series ''Persona'' games, returned as character designer.<ref name= \"P5magazine\"/> The game's art director was Masayoshi Suto, whose most notable work on earlier games included the [[user interface]] (UI) displays.<ref name=\"FamMusicArt\"/> The art design reflected the picaresque theme aimed for by the rest of the team.<ref name=\"FamMusicArt\"/> As the team considered previous ''Persona'' games to be \"fun\" but not well marketed, they designed the UI in such a way as to attract a larger, more mainstream audience.<ref name=\"P5cedecUI\"/> According to Soejima, he was working on prospective designs for the game while ''Persona 4'' was still in development, with his designs evolving as the story for ''Persona 5'' came together.<ref name=\"RPGSinterview\"/> Aesthetically, the team felt that they were picking up where ''Persona 4'' left off. Its styling presentation was an unintentional reflection on the hurdles the team needed to overcome during development.<ref name= \"P5magazine\"/> Following the respective thematic coloring of ''Persona 3'' and ''4''{{'s}} blue and yellow, ''Persona 5'' used red, which was chosen to a harsh feeling.<ref name=\"P5cedecUI\"/><ref name=\"GematsuFreedom\"/> Because of this, Suto tested multiple font colors until settling on black and white, as it stood out best against it.<ref name=\"FamMusicArt\"/> There was also a wish, especially in the teaser image used for the game's announcement, which represented the main characters' being chained down by the rules of the modern world.<ref name=\"GematsuFreedom\"/> Soejima designed the logo to convey the high-speed existences of the young cast, while elements such as Joker's Persona Ars\u00e8ne were designed to appear old-fashioned by comparison. This presented challenges as Soejima needed to balance this with a strong sense of style.<ref name=\"GemDetails\"/> The main aim for the game's environments was to create a sense of realism, with Tokyo being modeled after real locations.<ref name=\"FamMusicArt\"/><ref>{{cite web|last1=Ashcraft|first1=Brian|title=Persona 5's In-Game Locations Compared To The Real World|url=https://kotaku.com/persona-5s-in-game-locations-compared-to-the-real-world-1787125885|website=Kotaku|accessdate=January 27, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171031184625/https://kotaku.com/persona-5s-in-game-locations-compared-to-the-real-world-1787125885|archivedate=October 31, 2017}}</ref> When creating the UI, Hashino wanted to demonstrate how a shift in perspective could alter a dull life into an exciting one in the context of the story. Early UI designs were so \"aggressively animated\" that it obscured what was happening in the game. Because of this, the animations were toned down and text orientation was altered, toning down the UI's graphical elements to present a balance between user-friendliness and style.<ref name=\"P5hashinoUI\"/> Rather than the use of sub-colors for earlier entries, the UI used only the primary red, black and white colors aside from health and magic point meters, with the menus using a special moving 3D model of Joker which would change position depending on the selected menu.<ref name=\"P5cedecUI\"/>\n\nThe first character sketches were submitted in 2012.<ref name=\"AndriaPersonaB\"/> Soejima worked closely with Hashino so the characters and environments reflected the game's themes.<ref name=\"Persona5Theme\"/> Due to being high school students, Soejima found it difficult to make each main character's uniform design distinctive, so he expressed their individuality through their thief costumes.<ref name=\"Meguro/Soejima\"/> Joker's design was cited by Soejima as his most challenging recent work. Joker needed to both convey a taste of the game's overall art style and to act as an avatar for the player. As the main theme and narrative of ''Persona 5'' revolved around crime and vigilantes triggered by Joker voluntarily choosing that path, Soejima needed to convey this while allowing the character to suit whatever dialogue choices the player decided upon. Due to these difficulties, Joker was given multiple designs in a trial and error process to find the best one. As the \"phantom thief\" premise was a common stereotype in fiction, Soejima initially drew Joker and main cast in a style similar to [[sh\u014dnen manga]], but these designs were scrapped as they clashed with the ''Persona'' series' realistic aesthetics. As with previous entries, Joker was a silent character, so as with previous protagonist Soejima had to work out a way he could communicate without dialogue. His solution was to imagine him as the type of person who made plans but did not share them with others.<ref name=\"FamSoejima\"/> The Persona designs, being based on characters from literature, were intended to evoke both familiarity and surprise from players. Once the names were chosen, Soejima designed the Personas based on that character.<ref name=\"Meguro/Soejima\"/>\n\nThe game's animated [[cutscene]]s were produced by [[Production I.G]] and Domerica, and were directed and supervised by Toshiyuki Kono.<ref name=\"GemDetails\"/><ref name=\"Domerica\"/> Kono was contacted three and a half years before the game's completion by Hashino: faced with the project, Kono felt a great deal of pressure in his role. ''Persona 5'' was the first time Production I.G had worked on the series, though many staff at the studio were fans. Despite this, the studio did not change their standard animation process, focusing on characters as they had done for many of their previous projects. The most important part of the cutscenes was getting the character's expressions right, particularly when it came to the general-mute protagonist. The game's animated opening sequence was directed by [[Sayo Yamamoto]].<ref name=\"P5FamIG\"/> The concept behind the characters figure skating around the environment was done as a visual symbolization of the game's overall theme, breaking free of an oppressive force, and was similar to her work in ''[[Yuri on Ice]]''.<ref name=\"GemDetails\"/> The scene where Joker first summoned his Persona was requested by Atlus to appear \"wild\", which again was difficult to Joker's purpose as an extension of the player. The blue flame effects related to the Persona were not created with CGI, but hand-drawn by the animators. All the anime cutscenes together were estimated as containing over an hour of footage.<ref name=\"P5FamIG\"/>\n\n===Music===\nThe game's original score was composed, performed, and produced by series sound director [[Shoji Meguro]].<ref name=\"P5liners\"/> Further contributions, among other general sound design, was handled by Toshiki Konishi, Kenichi Tsuchiya, Atsushi Kitajoh, and Ryota Kozuka; all of them having previously worked on the series as well.<ref name=\"FamMusicArt\"/><ref name=\"P5liners\"/><ref name=\"P5Album\"/> Meguro was given full creative freedom to work on the soundtrack, with around 80% of the tracks used in the game being his, which lasted around three years in total.<ref name=\"Meguro/Soejima\"/> Seven tracks were performed in English by Lyn Inaizumi, a [[jazz]] and [[soul music]] singer.<ref name=\"P5liners\"/><ref name=\"P5Album\"/><ref name=\"LynTwitter\"/> Her first performance in a video game, Inaizumi claimed that the most difficult part of her contributions was performing a rap segment in the opening theme, \"Wake Up, Get Up, Get Out There\".<ref name=\"PSCmusic\"/> The lyrics were written by Benjamin Franklin, while the ending song, \"Hoshi To Bokura To\", had lyrics written in Japanese by Shigeo Komori.<ref name=\"P5liners\"/>\n\nTo express the game's mood, Meguro incorporated strong [[acid jazz]] elements into the score.<ref name=\"SilComposer\"/> He also aimed to make the music sound more realistic than previous ''Persona'' games, aiming to match the game's visuals.<ref name=\"Meguro/Soejima\"/> Meguro also changed the way the music flowed when compared to the last two ''Persona'' games. Instead of the opening and ending themes being conglomerates of the overall score, he described the entire score as a single continuous work. A recurring musical element he included was described as a \"[[Solmization|do-la]]\" syllable: the opening used \"so la re mi\" on strings as a hook, which then led into the \"do-la\" syllable for other tracks, including the normal battle theme. While he was creating the music, Meguro received positive comments from Hashino when he made early tracks created for an internal demo.<ref name=\"FamMusicArt\"/>\n\nA three-disc soundtrack was released in Japan by Mastard Records on January 17, 2017.<ref name=\"P5Album\"/> Upon its debut, the album reached fifth on the [[Oricon]] charts with sales of over 29,000.<ref name=\"P5OSToricon\"/> The album featured 110 tracks with commentary from the sound team, while the cover and [[liner note]] artwork were designed by Soejima.<ref name=\"P5AlbumInfo\"/> In addition to the soundtrack, a 19-track disc featuring a selection of the main themes from the game, ''Persona 5: Sounds of the Rebellion'', was released as part of the North American and European collector's edition bundle.<ref name=\"P5Album\"/> The complete soundtrack later received a localized English release on [[iTunes]] on April 18, 2017, and on vinyl later that year by [[iam8bit]].<ref name=\"P5ostItunes\"/><ref>{{cite web|last1=Arif|first1=Shabana|title=Persona 5's complete soundtrack is available to pre-order on vinyl as a 6 LP deluxe edition for $175|url=https://www.vg247.com/2017/05/01/persona-5s-complete-soundtrack-is-available-to-pre-order-on-vinyl-as-a-6-lp-deluxe-edition-for-175/|website=VG24/7|accessdate=January 2, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180102141737/https://www.vg247.com/2017/05/01/persona-5s-complete-soundtrack-is-available-to-pre-order-on-vinyl-as-a-6-lp-deluxe-edition-for-175/|archivedate=January 2, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n[[File:Sega promotional models and Persona 5 title, Taipei Game Show 20170123.jpg|thumb|Promotion of ''Persona 5'' at the 2017 Taipei Game Show]]\n''Persona 5'' was first announced with a teaser trailer in 2013, alongside spin-off games ''[[Persona Q: Shadow of the Labyrinth]]'', ''[[Persona 4: Dancing All Night]]'', and the [[PlayStation 3]] [[Porting|port]] of ''[[Persona 4 Arena Ultimax]]''.<ref name=\"PolyPersona\" /> The game was originally announced for a late 2014 release exclusively for the PlayStation 3.

An expanded version featuring new content, '''''Persona 5 Royal''''',{{efn|Known as ''Persona 5: The Royal'' {{nihongo||\u30da\u30eb\u30bd\u30ca5 \u30b6\u30fb\u30ed\u30a4\u30e4\u30eb|Perusona Faibu Za Roiyaru}} in Japanese}} was released in Japan in October 2019 and worldwide in March 2020.\n\n''Persona 5'' takes place in modern-day [[Tokyo]] and follows [[Joker (Persona)|Joker]] after his transfer to Shujin Academy due to being put on probation for an assault of which he was falsely accused. During a school year, he and other students awaken to special powers, becoming a group of secret [[vigilante]]s known as the [[Phantom Thieves of Hearts]]. They explore the Metaverse, a supernatural realm born from humanity's subconscious desires, to steal malevolent intent from the hearts of adults. As with previous games in the series, the party battles enemies known as Shadows using physical manifestations of their psyche known as the [[Persona (series)#Personas|Persona]]. The game incorporates role-playing and [[dungeon crawl]]ing elements alongside [[Social simulation game|social simulation]] scenarios.\n\n''Persona 5'' was developed by P-Studio, an internal development studio within Atlus led by game director and producer [[Katsura Hashino]]. Along with Hashino, returning staff from earlier ''Persona'' games included character designer [[Shigenori Soejima]] and music composer [[Shoji Meguro]]. Preparatory work began during the development of ''[[Persona 4]]'', with full development beginning after the release of ''[[Catherine (video game)|Catherine]]'' in 2011. First announced in 2013, ''Persona 5'' was delayed from its original late 2014 release date due to the game not being fully finished. The game's themes revolved around attaining freedom from the limitations of modern society, while its story was strongly inspired by [[picaresque fiction]] and the party's Personas being based on well-known literary outlaws and rebels.\n\n''Persona 5'' was met with critical acclaim, with praise given to its visual presentation and art direction, cast, gameplay, and music. The game is considered to be one of the greatest role-playing games of all time and was nominated for and won multiple awards. The game shipped over three million copies worldwide by the end of 2019, making it the best-selling entry in the overall ''Megami Tensei'' franchise. Several other media, including two spin-off games, ''[[Persona 5: Dancing in Starlight]]'' and ''[[Persona 5 Scramble]]'', as well as manga and [[Persona 5: The Animation|anime adaptations]], have also been released. The game's cast has also made appearances in other games, such as Joker appearing as a playable character in the 2018 crossover fighting game ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]''.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n{{See also|Persona (series)#Gameplay|l1=Gameplay of the Persona series}}\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = vertical\n| footer = [[Joker (Persona)|Joker]], the game's protagonist, has two alternating lifestyles: a normal student life ''(top)'', and adventures into otherworldly locations ''(bottom)''.\n| image1 = Persona 5 Classroom.jpg\n| width1 = 250\n| image2 = Persona 5 Palace Combat.jpg\n| width2 = 250\n}}\n''Persona 5'' is a [[role-playing video game]] where the player takes on the role of a high school student, codenamed [[Joker (Persona)|Joker]], who lives out a single year while attending school in modern-day [[Tokyo]]. The game is governed by a day-night cycle and weather systems that determine general behavior similar to a [[social simulation game]]. The year is punctuated by both scripted and random events as Joker attends school. He can perform part-time jobs and pursue leisure activities or create battle items. These various activities raise character attributes, which grant passive [[Status effect#Buffs|buffing]] effects during battle.<ref name=\"RPGgameplay\"/><ref name=\"GemCharactersB\"/><ref name=\"P5FamGameplay\"/><ref name=\"PolyGameplay\"/> When in the real world, the main protagonist can develop character relationships known as ''Confidants''; an evolution of the ''Social Link'' system from ''[[Persona 3]]'' and ''[[Persona 4]]''. With this system, the main protagonist can converse with and improve his relationship with other characters he meets, with some leading to possible romances. Improving Confidant ranks with [[Party (role-playing games)|party]] members unlocks various abilities for use in combat, such as the \"Baton Pass\" ability, which allows the player to directly select another character after a critical hit while granting a temporary attack boost.<ref name=\"P5FamGameplay\"/> Improving ranks with non-party Confidants grant other bonuses, such as giving access to new [[Item (gaming)|items]] and equipment and boosting [[experience point]] and yen gain.<ref name=\"P5FamGameplay\"/>\n\nAlongside the normal school life is [[dungeon crawl]]ing gameplay of two different types within a realm called the Metaverse: story-specific dungeons called Palaces and randomly-generated Mementos dungeons. Both are populated by Shadows, physical manifestations of suppressed psyches that are modeled after mythological and religious figures. Within Mementos dungeons, the party can fulfill requests from [[non-playable character]]s (NPCs) received from a \"Confidant\" links.<ref name=\"RPGgameplay\"/><ref name=\"P5FamGameplay\"/><ref name=\"PolyGameplay\"/><ref name=\"SilGameplayPersonas\"/> While navigating, the party uses stealth to avoid the sight of enemy Shadows, and some areas hold puzzles that can be solved using an insight ability known as \"Third Eye\",<ref name=\"P5FamBattle\"/> which highlights interactable objects and enemy strength compared to the party. When exploring story-centered Palaces, an \"Alertness Meter\" is present, where the party being spotted or fleeing combat results in security being raised. If security reaches 100%, the party is forced to leave the Palace. The Alertness level can be lowered by launching surprise attacks on and eliminating enemies, and also lowers automatically overnight.<ref name=\"P5gameplayBits\"/> Throughout Palaces are locations known as \"safe rooms\". In them, the player can [[Saved game|save their game]], heal their party, and [[fast travel]] to other safe rooms within the Palace.\n\nAs with previous entries in the series, the game uses a [[Turns, rounds and time-keeping systems in games#Turn-based|turn-based]] combat system: battles can be initiated when the party runs into an enemy, or they can launch a surprise attack and gain an advantage in battle. In battle, the party has access to both melee and gun weapons, in addition to being able to summon Personas, manifestations of the main characters' inner psyche used mainly for special attacks.<ref name=\"PolyGameplay\"/><ref name=\"P5FamBattle\"/><ref name=\"GemDetails\"/><ref name=\"GemDetails\"/><ref name=\"ShackMasks\">{{cite web |url=https://www.gamexeed.com/2020/03/persona-5-royal-new-ps4-game-2020.html |title=Persona 5 Royal New PS4 Game 2020?? |last=Teja|first=Ravi |publisher=Raviteja|date=March 4, 2020 |accessdate=March 4, 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160830213249/https://www.gamexeed.com/2020/03/persona-5-royal-new-ps4-game-2020.html |archivedate=March 4, 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"ShackMasks\"/> If a character strikes an enemy's weakness, they knock the enemy down and are awarded an additional turn. If all enemies are knocked down, a \"Hold Up\" is triggered. During one, the party can launch a devastating \"All-Out Attack\", demand money or items, or enter a negotiation. Negotiation allows Joker to win the selected Shadow over to their side to become a new Persona: they can only be persuaded to join if Joker is their level or higher.<ref name=\"RPGgameplay\"/><ref name=\"PolyGameplay\"/><ref name=\"DigiGameplay\"/> Similar to previous entries, party members can be knocked out, and if the main character is knocked out, the game ends. At times, if a party member is knocked out, they can be captured by enemy Shadows, and is unable to return to the party if the resultant negotiation fails.<ref name=\"P5gameplayBits\"/>\n\nNew Personas are gained from battle through successful negotiation, and different Persona types are represented through different arcana linked to Confidant links. Personas can be combined, or \"fused\", or otherwise further manipulated within the Velvet Room, a realm Joker visits as part of his journey through the story.<ref name=\"SilGameplayPersonas\"/><ref name=\"PSeriesInfo\"/> In the Velvet Room, Personas can be fused with \"Guillotine\" fusion processes, with the resultant Persona inheriting skills and stats from its parents. The more skills a Persona has, the more are passed on to the fused Persona. How powerful Personas are through fusion depends on how advanced its associated Confidant link is. Also, Personas can be sacrificed in various ways, also styled after styles of capital punishment: \"Hanging\" grants a sacrificed Persona's experience points to another chosen Persona, and \"Electric Chair\" sacrifice one to create a high-end item. A Persona can also be sent into \"Solitary Confinement\", where they undergo intensive training and gain additional skills quicker than normal. The number of days a Persona must remain to gain strength lessens based on its arcana strength.<ref name=\"SilGameplayPersonas\"/>\n\nMinor multiplayer elements are incorporated into the game through the \"Thieves Guild\" feature. Similar to the \"Vox Populi\" system from ''Persona 4 Golden'', players have the option of seeing what activities other players did during any given day. Players can send messages to each other, in addition to affecting the Alertness meter in the player's favor, and aiding in battle when a party member is taken hostage by an enemy.<ref name=\"P5FamGameplay\"/><ref name=\"P5gameplayBits\"/>\n\n==Synopsis==\n===Setting and characters===\n{{Main Article|List of Persona 5 characters}}\n''Persona 5'' takes place within the ''Persona'' universe, revolving around a group of high school students who harness Personas, physical manifestations of their inner psyche.<ref name=\"GIpersona\"/> ''Persona 5'' is set in modern-day Tokyo, in April of the year \"20XX\", with navigable real-world locations within the city including [[Akihabara]], [[Shinjuku]] and [[Shibuya]].<ref name=\"P5year\"/> Alongside larger environments, there are specific locations that can be entered, such as shops, restaurants and movie theaters. A major setting throughout the game is Shujin Academy, a high school that the protagonist attends.<ref name=\"GemCharactersB\"/><ref name=\"FamTokyo\"/><ref name=\"GemCharactersA\"/> The second major location is the \"Metaverse\", a supernatural realm consisting of the physical manifestation of humanity's subconscious desires. In the Metaverse, people with corrupted enough desires form their own unique \"Palace\", which is modeled after their distorted perception of the world, along with a Shadow version of themselves possessing a \"Treasure\" symbolic of their desires.<ref name=\"FamTokyo\"/><ref name=\"P5persona\"/><ref name=\"PMythDetail\"/> Returning from earlier entries is the Velvet Room, a place that exists for the growth of Persona users that shifts appearance depending on the current guest: in ''Persona 5'', it takes the form of a prison.<ref name=\"PSeriesInfo\"/>\n\nThe [[player character]] is a [[silent protagonist]], a commonplace feature in other ''Persona'' games, codenamed [[Joker (Persona)|Joker]]. He becomes the leader of a [[vigilante]] group known as the Phantom Thieves of Hearts, who change the hearts of criminals and other malevolent people through the Metaverse.<ref name=\"GemCharactersA\"/><ref name=\"GIinterview\"/> He forms it with Morgana, a mysterious cat-like creature who serves as the Thieves' second-in-command, who wants to discover his origins and restore his true form. Other founding members include school delinquent Ryuji Sakamoto and fashion model Ann Takamaki. More people join the group throughout the game, including art prodigy Yusuke Kitagawa, student council president [[Makoto Niijima]], [[hikikomori]] computer hacker Futaba Sakura, and cultured corporate heiress Haru Okumura.<ref name=\"GemCharactersB\"/><ref name=\"GemCharactersA\"/><ref name=\"GIinterview\"/> Also interacting with Joker are Goro Akechi, a high school detective; Sae Niijima, public prosecutor and Makoto's older sister; and the residents of the Velvet Room, Igor and his two assistants Caroline and Justine.<ref name=\"GemCharactersB\"/><ref name=\"KotakuLysis\"/> Joker also has interactions with other confidants, including his caretaker and Futaba's adoptive father Sojiro Sakura, classmate Yuuki Mishima, his teacher and part-time maid Sadayo Kawakami, arcade gamer Shinya Oda, journalist Ichiko Ohya, [[fortune teller]] Chihaya Mifune, [[shogi]] master Hifumi Togo, doctor Tae Takemi, politician Toranosuke Yoshida, and [[model gun]] store owner Munehisa Iwai.\n\n===Plot===\nAfter Joker defends a woman from being abused by a drunken man on the street, he is falsely charged with assault and put on [[probation]], resulting in expulsion from his school. Joker is sent to Tokyo to stay with his family associate Sojiro Sakura and attend Shujin Academy during his year-long probation. After his arrival, he is drawn into the Velvet Room, where Igor warns him that he must \"rehabilitate\" to avoid forthcoming ruin, and grants him access to a supernatural mobile app that leads Joker into the Metaverse and the Palace of the school's abusive volleyball coach Suguru Kamoshida. Joker meets Morgana, who informs him of the ability to change wicked people's hearts by stealing their \"Treasure\", the emotional root of their behavior, from the Palaces ruled by their Shadow selves. After successfully reforming Kamoshida, Ryuji, Joker, Ann, and Morgana form the Phantom Thieves of Hearts, stealing corruption from the hearts of adults to reform the city.\n\nAs the number of the Phantom Thieves' members and successes grows, they attract the attention of the public and police, including public prosecutor Sae Niijima and detective prodigy Goro Akechi. The Phantom Thieves learn that another secret group, including a black-masked assassin, is using the Metaverse to murder their targets and then framing the Phantom Thieves of Hearts for the killings. In pursuit of the conspiracy, the group is joined by Akechi, who is subsequently revealed to be the black-masked assassin. Escaping into hiding with Sae's help, the Phantom Thieves deduce that the conspiracy's leader is politician Masayoshi Shido, who has been using Akechi's ability to infiltrate the Metaverse to remove obstacles to his becoming Prime Minister and imposing his reforms on Japan, as well as the one who pressed assault charges against Joker. When the Phantom Thieves infiltrate Shido's Palace, they face Akechi, who reveals himself to be Shido's illegitimate son. He also reveals that he has been secretly plotting to exact his revenge on Shido for years of neglect and summons his true Persona: Loki. Once defeated, Akechi sacrifices himself to protect the Phantom Thieves from a group of enemies, allowing them to escape and reach Shido.\n\nDespite Shido's arrest and confession after his change of heart, the public remains uninterested and has lost trust in both authority and the Phantom Thieves. In response, the Phantom Thieves make a final heist to infiltrate the depths of Mementos and steal the treasure at its core. Inside, they discover that the public is in chaos and has chosen to give up their autonomy. The Phantom Thieves are then ejected from Mementos by the Treasure, taking form as the Holy Grail, and vanish after witnessing the Metaverse merge with reality. Waking in the Velvet Room, Joker confronts Igor, Caroline, and Justine. Caroline and Justine regain their memories and merge into Lavenza, their true form. Lavenza reveals the Igor Joker has been seeing in the Velvet room up until this point to be an imposter who imprisoned the real Igor. The imposter is then revealed to be [[Yaldabaoth]], the Holy Grail, who was created from humanity's wish to give up control. Through a bet made with Igor over humanity's goals, Yaldabaoth had given Joker and Akechi their abilities to see whether the world would be preserved or be destroyed through their actions, all while steering the game in his favor.\n\nJoker rejects Yaldabaoth's offer to return to his world at the cost of his freedom, and he, along with the rest of the Phantom Thieves, fight him. Joker's confidants rally the popular support of the people, rebelling against Yaldabaoth's control of humanity and allowing Joker to awaken his ultimate persona to destroy Yaldabaoth and the Metaverse. After Yaldabaoth's defeat, in order for Shido to be prosecuted, Joker must turn himself into the police. While Joker is incarcerated, the rest of the Phantom Thieves and his confidants successfully help secure evidence of Joker's innocence in the assault charge, leading to his conviction being overturned. By spring, Joker's friends drive him back to his hometown.\n\n===''Royal''===\nIn ''Persona 5 Royal'', two new characters interact with the Phantom Thieves: Kasumi Yoshizawa, an accomplished rhythmic gymnast who transferred to Shujin at the same time as the protagonist, and Takuto Maruki, a school counselor hired after Kamoshida is exposed. Kasumi awakens to her Persona after calling the protagonist to a new Palace in Odaiba that quickly vanishes. Maruki, in turn, talks to each of the Phantom Thieves, learning their deepest wishes. After defeating Yaldabaoth, the still-living Akechi turns himself over to Sae in the protagonist's place. At the beginning of the following year, the protagonist finds reality distorted; Akechi was released without reason, and each Phantom Thief member has had their deepest wish granted. The protagonist and Akechi, together with the also-aware Kasumi, return to the Odaiba Palace and investigate. The Palace's master is Maruki, who reveals that \"Kasumi\" is Sumire, sister to the original Kasumi, who died in a car accident saving Sumire.\n\nMaruki can use his Persona to alter a person's reality, with his first use of it being to make his then-girlfriend forget her parents' murder. Yaldabaoth's manipulation of the world drove Maruki and his Persona over the edge, and they became the new controllers of Mementos and warped all reality into a dream-like ideal. Sumire turns against the protagonist to protect her identity as \"Kasumi.\" The protagonist snaps his friends out of Maruki's reality, then frees Sumire from his influence. Depending on player choices, it is revealed that Akechi's survival is dependant on the new reality, and Maruki offers the protagonist the option of accepting it to save Akechi. Refusing the offer, the reformed Phantom Thieves, including Akechi and Sumire, defeat Maruki. Reality returns to normal, and with Akechi missing and the protagonist in prison.\n\nOn their final meeting after the protagonist's release, each member of the Phantom Thieves chooses to pursue their dreams within the current reality. On the day he is due to return home, the protagonist escapes tailing government agents with help from both the Phantom Thieves and a reformed Maruki. At the station, Sumire bids him farewell. If Akechi's confidant level is at its highest, and with the right dialogue choices, a man wearing Akechi's clothes is briefly seen passing through the train window that the protagonist is riding.\n\n==Development==\nThe game was developed by P-Studio, an internal development studio within Atlus dedicated to handling the ''Persona'' series. Preparatory development of the game began in 2008, following the release of ''[[Persona 4]]'', with full development beginning following the release of ''[[Catherine (video game)|Catherine]]'' in 2011.<ref name=\"KotakuPersonaA\"/><ref name=\"RPGSinterview\"/><ref name=\"AndriaPersonaA\"/><ref name=\"CGMagInterview\"/> Hashino was only fully involved in development after ''Catherine'' was finished, later calling the latter game a test for the next ''Persona'' game's development. Development lasted five years.<ref name=\"PersonaBlog\"/><ref name=\"4Gstory\"/> ''Persona 5'' would be Hashino's last game in the series as the leader of P-Studio, as he would afterwards form a separate internal team called Studio Zero.<ref name=\"P5studioA\"/><ref name=\"P5studioB\"/> When production started, the staff consisted of around 40 people. During full production, this number expanded to 70: 15 planners, 15 programmers, and between 30 and 45 designers. These included the game's lead designer Naoya Maeda, who had previously done modeling work for the ''[[Trauma Center (video game series)|Trauma Center]]'' series. The general development was a challenge for the team, as they intentionally changed their development structure due to the more powerful hardware they were working with.<ref name=\"CGMagInterview\"/>\n\nWhile the final game retained the turn-based system from earlier entries, one of the early design drafts was for an action-based system incorporating real-time elements foreign to the series. This idea was ultimately scrapped, but real-time command elements were introduced into the battle system, allowing the gameplay to evolve without extensive changes to the core system.<ref name=\"PSblogHashino\"/> A major new addition was the inclusions of unique dungeons with locked layouts as opposed to the dominant randomly generated dungeons of previous ''Persona'' games. This was done to both emulate the game's themes and provide veteran players with something different.<ref name=\"USGp5Interview\"/> A returning feature from both earlier ''Persona'' games and the mainline ''[[Megami Tensei]]'' series was Negotiation: as it was considered a key part of the overall franchise by fans, Hashino decided to reintroduce it after being absent from the previous two mainline entries. The Negotiation system for ''Persona 5'' was tied into the origins of Shadows as suppressed psyches within the Collective Unconscious. The \"Hold Up\" function was inspired by scenes in films where the antagonist would hold people at gunpoint and make demands. These functions were incorporated due to the game being in part a celebration of the series' history.<ref name=\"4Gstory\"/> While designing the gameplay elements, the weather, and environmental elements were all designed to reflect the real world. Dungeon layout was split into three distinct types: the Tokyo overworld environments, \"institutions\" such as Joker's high school, and dungeon environments.<ref name=\"CGMagInterview\"/> Some segments took control away from the player aside from limited dialogue choices; this was chosen as it reflected the controlled environment of Japanese high schoolers.<ref name=\"P5hashinoUI\"/>\n\nWhile ''Catherine'' used the third-party [[Gamebryo]] [[game engine]], ''Persona 5'' used a specially-created engine. Hashino believed that the new engine would make rendering their ideas much easier, although it would result in a long wait by fans for the game.<ref name=\"AndriaPersonaA\"/><ref name=\"CathBryon\"/> The event scene software was also developed internally by Atlus, with an estimated 1,160 being featured in the final game. The tools for developing and handling them were greatly expanded over the previous two entries to properly communicate them to players on the more advanced hardware.<ref name=\"CGMagInterview\"/> Character modeling, in general, was handled with a specially-developed toon shader which helped properly translate the character designs into the game, while also allowing for easy adjustment of shaders and lighting effects during fine-tuning.<ref name=\"CGMagInterview\"/> The characters were originally rendered realistically like in ''Catherine'', but the team felt that it was \"wrong\" for the ''Persona'' series. With this in mind, the team did some trial and error before finding a style that satisfied them, doing something similar for the interface and menu design.<ref name=\"P5magazine\"/> In contrast to ''Persona 4'', which had a general deformed look to hardware limitations on the variety of body shapes, the technology available to the team for ''Persona 5'' enabled unique customization for all relevant character models. Two different models were used for members of the main cast: a detailed model for real-time cutscenes, and a general-use model for general event scenes and gameplay.<ref name=\"CGMagInterview\"/> ''Persona 5'' was the first time a large number of Personas had been rendered in high definition, something which proved a grueling challenge for the team.<ref name=\"GemDetails\"/>\n\n===Story and themes===\nThe original story concept was written by Hashino, while the scenario was co-written by Shinji Yamamoto and Yuichiro Tanaka.<ref name=\"P5credits\"/><ref name=\"Persona5Maniacus\"/> The initial concept was for a storyline that diverged from the established paths of ''Persona 3'' and ''Persona 4'', with \"self-discovery\" and \"journey\" being its keywords.<ref name=\"PSblogHashino\"/> Originally using the concept of a [[Backpacking (travel)|backpacking trip]] around the world as a framing device for the story, Hashino decided to refocus on Japan in the wake of the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]].<ref name=\"4Gstory\"/> More specifically, it has been noted that the Japanese government's actions in response to the earthquake and tsunami's fallout, along with Japanese citizens' reactions to how the government acted during that time, may have served as partial influences on the game's themes.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.usgamer.net/articles/the-real-world-problems-behind-persona-5|title=The Real-World Problems Behind Persona 5|last=McCarthy|first=Caty|date=May 5, 2017|website=USgamer|language=en|access-date=June 29, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190603100720/https://www.usgamer.net/articles/the-real-world-problems-behind-persona-5|archive-date=June 3, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Following that crisis and seeing how people were bonding in the face of it, Hashino decided to have the story take place solely in Japan, with the journeying being done through the ever-shifting Palaces.<ref name=\"PSblogHashino\"/> Ultimately, the story's central concepts were inspired by equivalent social changes he saw in modern society, particularly in Japan.<ref name=\"PMythDetail\" /> Hashino also described the central theme of the game as being about freedom and how the characters attain it.<ref name=\"Persona5Theme\"/> He wanted to make the game more \"thematically approachable\" for newcomers to the series, and to be an emotional experience that left its audience with a strong sense of [[catharsis]] and the inspiration to take on problems in their lives.<ref name=\"Persona5Theme\"/><ref name=\"SilCath\"/>\n\nThe narrative of ''Persona 5'' was designed like an omnibus, with the antagonists pursued by the party changing regularly.<ref name=\"P5persona\"/> As inspiration, the development team has also cited three main stories: the Chinese novel ''[[Water Margin]]'', the Japanese crime movie ''Hakuchuu no Shikaku'', and the Spanish novel ''[[Lazarillo de Tormes]]''.<ref name=\"PMinspiration\"/> Furthermore, the setting and style was compared to a [[Picaresque novel|picaresque fiction]]; the team originally asked the question of how a character like [[Ars\u00e8ne Lupin III]] might win appeal in modern society.<ref name=\"GemHashino\"/> This picaresque theme was carried over into the aesthetics of Persona fusion and sacrifice, which were themed after styles of capital punishment.<ref name=\"SilGameplayPersonas\"/> Having a more \"stereotypical\" theme enabled the team to create surprising story developments, mixing contemporary drama with the setting of the ''Persona'' series. The series' recurring motif of \"masks\" was used more overtly in the game's plot than previous entries as well,<ref name=\"SilP5Fam\"/> and the game's main locations were based heavily on their real-world counterparts.<ref name=\"P5FamGameplay\"/>\n\nThe main characters, according to Hashino, share a mindset that they \"no longer have a place where they belong in society\": the events of the game give them a sense of belonging.<ref name=\"GIinterview\"/> Hashino stated that while the last few games were about the protagonists chasing the antagonists, ''Persona 5'' would instead more prominently feature the antagonists and phenomena caused by them chasing the protagonists during the latter's activities. The characters have been described as \"juvenile academics,\"<ref name=\"GemHashino\"/> with their activities as thieves being part of the way they break from societal norms and express themselves. Adhering with this concept, the game's main aim was to show the characters finding the courage to go outside the normal limits of society as set by previous generations.<ref name=\"GemHashino\"/> In contrast to previous ''Persona'' casts, the party of ''Persona 5'' willingly embrace the unfolding unusual events in their role of masked vigilantes rather than being dragged into them.<ref name=\"GIinterview\"/> The cast was originally going to be larger with character Hifumi Togo becoming a Phantom Thief, but as the story was already very large, she was relegated to an optional role as part of the Confidant system.<ref name=\"PSCsecrets\"/> Technological advances such as [[smartphones]] and the use of [[social media]] were integrated into both the story and gameplay due to their growing prevalence in modern society and how the public responds to real-world scandals.<ref name=\"P5hashinoUI\"/><ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThe characters' initial Personas ([[Ars\u00e8ne Lupin|Ars\u00e8ne]], [[William Kidd|Captain Kidd]], [[Carmen (novella)|Carmen]], [[Zorro]], [[Ishikawa Goemon|Goemon]], [[Pope Joan|Johanna]], [[Necronomicon]], [[Milady de Winter|Milady]], [[Robin Hood]]) were themed after outlaws and picaresque heroes to reflect the function and dominant suppressed passions forming the Palace, and also represent aspects of their owners' personalities.<ref name=\"GemCharactersB\"/><ref name=\"GemCharactersA\"/><ref name=\"P5persona\"/><ref name=\"GIinterview\"/><ref name=\"Persona5Artbook\"/> Joker's initial Persona was originally the German demon [[Mephistopheles]], but it was changed to Ars\u00e8ne as the latter character better fit the game's themes.<ref name=\"PSCsecrets\"/> The cast's alternate Personas ([[Satan]]ael, [[Sun Wukong|Seiten Taisei]], [[Hecate]], [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercurius]], [[Susano-o|Kamu Susanoo]], [[Anat]], [[Prometheus]], [[Astarte]], [[Loki]]) are taken from mythical beings who act as tricksters or rebels.<ref name=\"Persona5Maniacus\"/><ref name=\"Persona5Artbook\"/> The three main inspirations behind Joker's alter ego were [[Ars\u00e8ne Lupin]], [[The Fiend with Twenty Faces]], and Japanese outlaw hero Ishikawa Goemon.<ref name=\"PMinspiration\"/> The name of Joker's high school, \"Shujin\", was chosen because it was a [[homonym]] of {{nihongo|''Sh\u016bjin''|\u56da\u4eba}}, the Japanese word for \"prisoner\".<ref name=\"KotakuPersonaB\"/> Following a trend from earlier entries, the Velvet Room assistants are named after characters from the novel ''[[Frankenstein]]'' by [[Mary Shelley]].<ref name=\"PSeriesInfo\"/>\n\nThe use of adults as antagonists was a more overt expression of narrative elements previously explored in ''Persona 4''. The relation to police activities was also carried over from ''Persona 4'', but this time with the role of protagonists and antagonists reversed.<ref name=\"PSblogHashino\" /> Several writers have highlighted the parallels between the game's various antagonists and real incidents/figures in different sectors of Japanese society (e.g. political, corporate, academic), and how the game's story and characters serve as social commentary on life in Japan.<ref name=\":5\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2017-05-12/the-real-japan-behind-persona-5/.116021|title=The Real Japan Behind Persona 5|last=Gay|first=Elliot|date=May 12, 2017|website=Anime News Network|language=en|access-date=June 30, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190630013134/https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2017-05-12/the-real-japan-behind-persona-5/.116021|archive-date=June 30, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The game's villains and protagonists were also constructed to be parallels of each other, both groups being misfits trying to shape a world they saw as unsatisfactory or corrupted. This was intended to create moral ambiguity about the Phantom Thieves' actions, causing the player to question their concept of justice and their mission as a whole.<ref name=\"4Gstory\" /> In addition, the way a vocal minority online could draw attention to and shift public opinion on events and scandals in the news was cited as an inspiration for the ambiguous nature of the Phantom Thieves' actions.<ref name=\"USGp5Interview\" />\n\n===Art design===\n[[Shigenori Soejima]], who had worked on the last two main-series ''Persona'' games, returned as character designer.<ref name= \"P5magazine\"/> The game's art director was Masayoshi Suto, whose most notable work on earlier games included the [[user interface]] (UI) displays.<ref name=\"FamMusicArt\"/> The art design reflected the picaresque theme aimed for by the rest of the team.<ref name=\"FamMusicArt\"/> As the team considered previous ''Persona'' games to be \"fun\" but not well marketed, they designed the UI in such a way as to attract a larger, more mainstream audience.<ref name=\"P5cedecUI\"/> According to Soejima, he was working on prospective designs for the game while ''Persona 4'' was still in development, with his designs evolving as the story for ''Persona 5'' came together.<ref name=\"RPGSinterview\"/> Aesthetically, the team felt that they were picking up where ''Persona 4'' left off. Its styling presentation was an unintentional reflection on the hurdles the team needed to overcome during development.<ref name= \"P5magazine\"/> Following the respective thematic coloring of ''Persona 3'' and ''4''{{'s}} blue and yellow, ''Persona 5'' used red, which was chosen to a harsh feeling.<ref name=\"P5cedecUI\"/><ref name=\"GematsuFreedom\"/> Because of this, Suto tested multiple font colors until settling on black and white, as it stood out best against it.<ref name=\"FamMusicArt\"/> There was also a wish, especially in the teaser image used for the game's announcement, which represented the main characters' being chained down by the rules of the modern world.<ref name=\"GematsuFreedom\"/> Soejima designed the logo to convey the high-speed existences of the young cast, while elements such as Joker's Persona Ars\u00e8ne were designed to appear old-fashioned by comparison. This presented challenges as Soejima needed to balance this with a strong sense of style.<ref name=\"GemDetails\"/> The main aim for the game's environments was to create a sense of realism, with Tokyo being modeled after real locations.<ref name=\"FamMusicArt\"/><ref>{{cite web|last1=Ashcraft|first1=Brian|title=Persona 5's In-Game Locations Compared To The Real World|url=https://kotaku.com/persona-5s-in-game-locations-compared-to-the-real-world-1787125885|website=Kotaku|accessdate=January 27, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171031184625/https://kotaku.com/persona-5s-in-game-locations-compared-to-the-real-world-1787125885|archivedate=October 31, 2017}}</ref> When creating the UI, Hashino wanted to demonstrate how a shift in perspective could alter a dull life into an exciting one in the context of the story. Early UI designs were so \"aggressively animated\" that it obscured what was happening in the game. Because of this, the animations were toned down and text orientation was altered, toning down the UI's graphical elements to present a balance between user-friendliness and style.<ref name=\"P5hashinoUI\"/> Rather than the use of sub-colors for earlier entries, the UI used only the primary red, black and white colors aside from health and magic point meters, with the menus using a special moving 3D model of Joker which would change position depending on the selected menu.<ref name=\"P5cedecUI\"/>\n\nThe first character sketches were submitted in 2012.<ref name=\"AndriaPersonaB\"/> Soejima worked closely with Hashino so the characters and environments reflected the game's themes.<ref name=\"Persona5Theme\"/> Due to being high school students, Soejima found it difficult to make each main character's uniform design distinctive, so he expressed their individuality through their thief costumes.<ref name=\"Meguro/Soejima\"/> Joker's design was cited by Soejima as his most challenging recent work. Joker needed to both convey a taste of the game's overall art style and to act as an avatar for the player. As the main theme and narrative of ''Persona 5'' revolved around crime and vigilantes triggered by Joker voluntarily choosing that path, Soejima needed to convey this while allowing the character to suit whatever dialogue choices the player decided upon. Due to these difficulties, Joker was given multiple designs in a trial and error process to find the best one. As the \"phantom thief\" premise was a common stereotype in fiction, Soejima initially drew Joker and main cast in a style similar to [[sh\u014dnen manga]], but these designs were scrapped as they clashed with the ''Persona'' series' realistic aesthetics. As with previous entries, Joker was a silent character, so as with previous protagonist Soejima had to work out a way he could communicate without dialogue. His solution was to imagine him as the type of person who made plans but did not share them with others.<ref name=\"FamSoejima\"/> The Persona designs, being based on characters from literature, were intended to evoke both familiarity and surprise from players. Once the names were chosen, Soejima designed the Personas based on that character.<ref name=\"Meguro/Soejima\"/>\n\nThe game's animated [[cutscene]]s were produced by [[Production I.G]] and Domerica, and were directed and supervised by Toshiyuki Kono.<ref name=\"GemDetails\"/><ref name=\"Domerica\"/> Kono was contacted three and a half years before the game's completion by Hashino: faced with the project, Kono felt a great deal of pressure in his role. ''Persona 5'' was the first time Production I.G had worked on the series, though many staff at the studio were fans. Despite this, the studio did not change their standard animation process, focusing on characters as they had done for many of their previous projects. The most important part of the cutscenes was getting the character's expressions right, particularly when it came to the general-mute protagonist. The game's animated opening sequence was directed by [[Sayo Yamamoto]].<ref name=\"P5FamIG\"/> The concept behind the characters figure skating around the environment was done as a visual symbolization of the game's overall theme, breaking free of an oppressive force, and was similar to her work in ''[[Yuri on Ice]]''.<ref name=\"GemDetails\"/> The scene where Joker first summoned his Persona was requested by Atlus to appear \"wild\", which again was difficult to Joker's purpose as an extension of the player. The blue flame effects related to the Persona were not created with CGI, but hand-drawn by the animators. All the anime cutscenes together were estimated as containing over an hour of footage.<ref name=\"P5FamIG\"/>\n\n===Music===\nThe game's original score was composed, performed, and produced by series sound director [[Shoji Meguro]].<ref name=\"P5liners\"/> Further contributions, among other general sound design, was handled by Toshiki Konishi, Kenichi Tsuchiya, Atsushi Kitajoh, and Ryota Kozuka; all of them having previously worked on the series as well.<ref name=\"FamMusicArt\"/><ref name=\"P5liners\"/><ref name=\"P5Album\"/> Meguro was given full creative freedom to work on the soundtrack, with around 80% of the tracks used in the game being his, which lasted around three years in total.<ref name=\"Meguro/Soejima\"/> Seven tracks were performed in English by Lyn Inaizumi, a [[jazz]] and [[soul music]] singer.<ref name=\"P5liners\"/><ref name=\"P5Album\"/><ref name=\"LynTwitter\"/> Her first performance in a video game, Inaizumi claimed that the most difficult part of her contributions was performing a rap segment in the opening theme, \"Wake Up, Get Up, Get Out There\".<ref name=\"PSCmusic\"/> The lyrics were written by Benjamin Franklin, while the ending song, \"Hoshi To Bokura To\", had lyrics written in Japanese by Shigeo Komori.<ref name=\"P5liners\"/>\n\nTo express the game's mood, Meguro incorporated strong [[acid jazz]] elements into the score.<ref name=\"SilComposer\"/> He also aimed to make the music sound more realistic than previous ''Persona'' games, aiming to match the game's visuals.<ref name=\"Meguro/Soejima\"/> Meguro also changed the way the music flowed when compared to the last two ''Persona'' games. Instead of the opening and ending themes being conglomerates of the overall score, he described the entire score as a single continuous work. A recurring musical element he included was described as a \"[[Solmization|do-la]]\" syllable: the opening used \"so la re mi\" on strings as a hook, which then led into the \"do-la\" syllable for other tracks, including the normal battle theme. While he was creating the music, Meguro received positive comments from Hashino when he made early tracks created for an internal demo.<ref name=\"FamMusicArt\"/>\n\nA three-disc soundtrack was released in Japan by Mastard Records on January 17, 2017.<ref name=\"P5Album\"/> Upon its debut, the album reached fifth on the [[Oricon]] charts with sales of over 29,000.<ref name=\"P5OSToricon\"/> The album featured 110 tracks with commentary from the sound team, while the cover and [[liner note]] artwork were designed by Soejima.<ref name=\"P5AlbumInfo\"/> In addition to the soundtrack, a 19-track disc featuring a selection of the main themes from the game, ''Persona 5: Sounds of the Rebellion'', was released as part of the North American and European collector's edition bundle.<ref name=\"P5Album\"/> The complete soundtrack later received a localized English release on [[iTunes]] on April 18, 2017, and on vinyl later that year by [[iam8bit]].<ref name=\"P5ostItunes\"/><ref>{{cite web|last1=Arif|first1=Shabana|title=Persona 5's complete soundtrack is available to pre-order on vinyl as a 6 LP deluxe edition for $175|url=https://www.vg247.com/2017/05/01/persona-5s-complete-soundtrack-is-available-to-pre-order-on-vinyl-as-a-6-lp-deluxe-edition-for-175/|website=VG24/7|accessdate=January 2, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180102141737/https://www.vg247.com/2017/05/01/persona-5s-complete-soundtrack-is-available-to-pre-order-on-vinyl-as-a-6-lp-deluxe-edition-for-175/|archivedate=January 2, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n[[File:Sega promotional models and Persona 5 title, Taipei Game Show 20170123.jpg|thumb|Promotion of ''Persona 5'' at the 2017 Taipei Game Show]]\n''Persona 5'' was first announced with a teaser trailer in 2013, alongside spin-off games ''[[Persona Q: Shadow of the Labyrinth]]'', ''[[Persona 4: Dancing All Night]]'', and the [[PlayStation 3]] [[Porting|port]] of ''[[Persona 4 Arena Ultimax]]''.<ref name=\"PolyPersona\" /> The game was originally announced for a late 2014 release exclusively for the PlayStation 3. During a Sony press conference in September 2014, it was announced that the game would also be released for the PlayStation 4, also announcing that it had been delayed into 2015. According to director Katsura Hashino, the game was delayed to fully develop for the PlayStation 4, and improve the general quality of the game for both versions.<ref name=\"PersonaPS4\" /> The game's first gameplay trailer was revealed during a special livestream on February 5, 2015. A [[Blu-ray Disc]] containing an exclusive trailer for the game was bundled with first print copies of ''Persona 4: Dancing All Night'' in Japan on June 25, 2015.<ref name=\"ANNreveal\" /> The song used in the first gameplay trailer was an instrumental version of the main theme.<ref name=\"SilComposer\" /> During a special livestream for the game at the 2015 [[Tokyo Game Show]], it was announced that the game would be delayed once again to late 2016.<ref name=\"GIdelay\" /> Speaking in a staff interview, Hashino apologized for the delay and stated that it was necessary to deliver a high-quality product without having to hold back in terms of content.<ref name=\"PersonaDelay\" />\n\nIn April 2016, Atlus launched an official countdown relating to the game that counted down to May 5, 2016.

Progress, Moscow, 1964\u20131973.</ref>\n\n==Ingredients and preparation==\n[[File:Challah Braiding.jpg|right|275px|thumb|Preparing braided challah]]\nMost traditional [[Ashkenazi]] challah recipes use numerous [[Egg (food)|eggs]], fine [[Flour|white flour]], [[water]], [[sugar]], [[yeast]], oil (such as vegetable or canola), and [[salt]], but \"water challah\" made without eggs and having a texture not unlike French baguettes also exists. Modern recipes may replace white flour with [[whole wheat]], [[oat]], or [[spelt]] flour or sugar with [[honey]] or [[molasses]].\n\nAmong [[Sephardic Jews]], water challah is preferred for ritual purposes, because Sephardic [[minhag]] does not require the [[dough offering]] to be separated if the dough contains eggs or sugar. While breads very similar to Ashkenazi egg challah are found in [[Sephardic cuisine]], they are typically not referred to as challah but considered variants of regional breads like [[\u00e7\u00f6rek]], eaten by Jews and non-Jews alike.\n\nEgg challah sometimes also contains [[raisins]] and/or [[saffron]]. After the first rising, the dough is rolled into rope-shaped pieces which are braided, though local (hands in [[Lithuania]], [[fish]] or hands in [[Tunisia]]) and seasonal (round, sometimes with a bird's head in the center) varieties also exist. [[Poppy (flower)|Poppy]] or [[sesame]] (Ashkenazi) and [[anise]] or [[sesame]] (Sephardic) seeds may be added to the dough or sprinkled on top. Both egg and water challah are usually brushed with an egg wash before baking to add a golden sheen.\n\nChallah is usually [[Milk and meat in Jewish law#Classification of foods|parve]] (containing neither dairy nor meat\u2014important in the laws of [[Kashrut]]), unlike [[brioche]] and other enriched European breads, which contain [[butter]] or [[milk]].\n\nIsraeli challah contains [[Eggs (food)|eggs]] or [[olive oil]] in the dough as well as [[water]], [[sugar]], [[yeast]], [[salt]], [[honey]] and [[raisins]].\nIt is topped with [[sesame]].\n\n==Rituals and religious significance==\n[[File:ShabbatableS.jpg|thumb|Prepared shabbat table, with challah in the foreground]]\nAccording to Jewish tradition, the three Sabbath meals ([[Friday]] night, [[Saturday]] lunch, and Saturday [[Seudah Shlishit|late afternoon]]) and two holiday meals (one at night and lunch the following day) each begin with two complete loaves of bread.<ref>Maimonides (d. 1204), [http://kodesh.snunit.k12.il/i/3130.htm Mishneh Torah Hilchot Shabbos, Chapter 30, Law 9.] '''(Hebrew)'''</ref> This \"double loaf\" (in Hebrew: ''lechem mishneh'') commemorates the [[manna]] that fell from the heavens when the [[Israelites]] wandered in the desert after [[the Exodus]]. The manna did not fall on Sabbath or holidays; instead, a double portion would fall the day before the holiday or sabbath in order to last for both days.<ref>Sol Scharfstein, ''Understanding Jewish Holidays and Customs'', page 16 (1999)</ref>\n\nIn some customs, each loaf is woven with six strands of dough. Together, the loaves have twelve strands, alluding to the twelve loaves of the [[showbread]] offering in the Temple.  Other numbers of strands commonly used are three, five and seven.  Occasionally twelve are used, referred to as a \"Twelve Tribes\" challah.\n\n===Traditional Sabbath meal procedure===\n[[File:Shabbat Challos.jpg|right|thumb|Two homemade challot covered by a traditional [[embroidery|embroidered]] [[challah cover]]]]\n\nIt is customary to begin the evening and day Sabbath and holiday meals with the following sequence of rituals:\n\n* The challah is covered. It is customary to use a dedicated cloth called a [[challah cover]] for this purpose, although any improvised cover is acceptable.\n\nSomething, often what is called a Challah board, is under the Challah, although a simple napkin is acceptable if nothing else is available. The \"under\" and \"covering\" are to remind of the ''dew'' that fell, before and after the manna. It also serves as a cutting board for slicing the Challah.\n\n(Another reason for the cover is that normally, in the order of saying blessings, the ''challah'' would precede the wine; we therefore ''cover'' the challah's presence.)\n* [[Kiddush]] is recited over a cup of [[wine]].\n* Each attendee [[Handwashing in Judaism|ritually washes their hands]] in preparation for eating bread. (It is customary not to talk between this washing and consumption of the bread.<ref name=\"Salt\">{{cite web|title=Salt|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/13043-salt|work=Jewish Encyclopedia|accessdate=7 March 2013}}</ref>)\n* The challah cover is removed.\n* A nick is made in the bread with a cutting knife.\n* The two loaves are held up together.\n* The head of the household recites the blessing over bread: \"''Baruch atah Adonai, eloheinu melech ha'olam, hamotzi lechem (Le Khemekh) min ha'aretz''\" (Translation: \"Blessed are you [[Yahweh|{{Lord}}]] our God, King of the Universe, who brings forth bread from the earth\").\n* The bread is sliced (or torn, depending on [[minhag]]) and salted, and the pieces are distributed to each person at the meal to eat.\n\nThe specific practice varies. Some dip the bread into salt before the blessing on bread.<ref>{{cite book|title=Isserles, in Shulc\u1e25an 'Aruch, l.c}}</ref> Others say the blessing, cut or tear the challah into pieces, and only then dip the pieces in salt, or sprinkle them with salt, before they are eaten.<ref>Both practices are based on different parts of the same verse in Leviticus</ref>\n\nNormally, the custom is not to talk between washing hands and eating bread. However, according to some, if salt was not placed on the table, it is permitted to ask for someone to bring salt, before the blessing on bread is recited.<ref>{{cite book|title=[[Shulchan Aruch]], Ora\u1e25 \u1e24ayyim 167:5; Jacob Zausmer, \"Bet Ya'a\u1e33ob,\" No. 168; comp. [[Berakhot (tractate)|Berachot]] 40a}}</ref>\n\n====Salting====\nSalting challah is considered a critical component of the meal. Customs vary whether the challah is dipped in salt, salt is sprinkled on it, or salt is merely present on the table.\n\nThe Torah requires that [[korban|Temple sacrifices]] to God be offered with salt.<ref>{{Bibleverse|Leviticus|2:13|HE}}</ref> Following the [[destruction of the Second Temple]], [[Rabbinic literature]] suggested that a table set for a meal symbolically replaces the Temple altar; therefore, the blessing over food should only be recited with salt present on the table.<ref name=\"Salt\"/> Should one eat a meal without performing a commandment, the covenant of salt protects him.<ref>Tosafot, Berachot 40a</ref>\n\nTo the rabbis, a meal without salt was considered no meal.<ref>Berachot 44a</ref> Furthermore, in the [[Torah]], salt symbolizes the eternal covenant between God and Israel.<ref name=\"Silberberg\">{{cite web|last=Silberberg|first=Naftali|title=Why is the Challah dipped in Salt|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/484194/jewish/Why-dip-in-salt.htm|publisher=Chabad.org|accessdate=7 March 2013}}</ref> As a preservative, salt never spoils or decays, signifying the immortality of this bond.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rabinowitz|first=Louis Isaac|title=Salt|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CCX2587517364&v=2.1&u=umd_um&it=r&p=GVRL&sw=w|work=Encyclopedia Judaica}}</ref>\n\n==Special challah==\n\n===Rosh Hashanah===\nOn [[Rosh Hashanah]], the Jewish New Year, the challah may be rolled into a circular shape (sometimes referred to as a \"turban challah\"), symbolizing the cycle of the year, and is sometimes baked with raisins in the dough. Some have the custom of continuing to eat circular challah from Rosh Hashana through the holiday of [[Sukkot]].\n\nSometimes the top is brushed with honey to symbolize the \"sweet new year.\" According to some traditions, challah eaten on Rosh Hashana is not dipped in or sprinkled with salt but instead is dipped in or sprinkled with honey. As above, some continue to use honey instead of salt through the Sukkot holiday.<ref>some keep the salt on the table, to not \"withhold\" salt from being present, per Lev. 2:13</ref>\n[[File:\u05d7\u05dc\u05ea \u05de\u05e4\u05ea\u05d7.jpg|thumb|Shlissel challah]]\n\n===Shlissel challah===\nFor the ''[[Special Shabbat#Shabbat Mevorchim|Shabbat Mevarchim]]'' preceding [[Rosh Chodesh]] [[Iyar]] (i.e., first ''Shabbat'' after the end of [[Passover]]), some Ashkenazi Jews have the custom of baking ''shlissel<ref>or schlissel</ref> challah'' (\"key challah\") as a ''[[Segula (Kabbalah)|segula]]'' (propitious sign) for ''parnassa'' (livelihood). Some make an impression of a key on top of the challah before baking, some place a key-shaped piece of dough on top of the challah before baking, and some bake an actual key inside the challah.<ref name=\"Key\">\"Second Thoughts: The Key to ''Parnassah''.\" ''Hamodia'', Feature Section, p. C3. 2009-04-23.</ref>\n\nThe earliest written source for this custom is the ''[[Sefer (Hebrew)|sefer]]'' ''Ohev Yisrael'' by Rabbi [[Avraham Yehoshua Heshel]], the Apter Rav, written in the 1800s. He calls ''schlissel challah'' \"an ancient custom,\" and offers several [[Kabbalah|kabbalistic]] interpretations. He writes that after spending forty years in the desert, the Israelites continued to eat the manna until they brought the [[Counting of the Omer|Omer]] offering on the second day of [[Passover]].

Progress, Moscow, 1964\u20131973.</ref>\n\n==Ingredients and preparation==\n[[File:Challah Braiding.jpg|right|275px|thumb|Preparing braided challah]]\nMost traditional [[Ashkenazi]] challah recipes use numerous [[Egg (food)|eggs]], fine [[Flour|white flour]], [[water]], [[sugar]], [[yeast]], oil (such as vegetable or canola), and [[salt]], but \"water challah\" made without eggs and having a texture not unlike French baguettes also exists. Modern recipes may replace white flour with [[whole wheat]], [[oat]], or [[spelt]] flour or sugar with [[honey]] or [[molasses]].\n\nAmong [[Sephardic Jews]], water challah is preferred for ritual purposes, because Sephardic [[minhag]] does not require the [[dough offering]] to be separated if the dough contains eggs or sugar. While breads very similar to Ashkenazi egg challah are found in [[Sephardic cuisine]], they are typically not referred to as challah but considered variants of regional breads like [[\u00e7\u00f6rek]], eaten by Jews and non-Jews alike.\n\nEgg challah sometimes also contains [[raisins]] and/or [[saffron]]. After the first rising, the dough is rolled into rope-shaped pieces which are braided, though local (hands in [[Lithuania]], [[fish]] or hands in [[Tunisia]]) and seasonal (round, sometimes with a bird's head in the center) varieties also exist. [[Poppy (flower)|Poppy]] or [[sesame]] (Ashkenazi) and [[anise]] or [[sesame]] (Sephardic) seeds may be added to the dough or sprinkled on top. Both egg and water challah are usually brushed with an egg wash before baking to add a golden sheen.\n\nChallah is usually [[Milk and meat in Jewish law#Classification of foods|parve]] (containing neither dairy nor meat\u2014important in the laws of [[Kashrut]]), unlike [[brioche]] and other enriched European breads, which contain [[butter]] or [[milk]].\n\nIsraeli challah contains [[Eggs (food)|eggs]] or [[olive oil]] in the dough as well as [[water]], [[sugar]], [[yeast]], [[salt]], [[honey]] and [[raisins]].\nIt is topped with [[sesame]].\n\n==Rituals and religious significance==\n[[File:ShabbatableS.jpg|thumb|Prepared shabbat table, with challah in the foreground]]\nAccording to Jewish tradition, the three Sabbath meals ([[Friday]] night, [[Saturday]] lunch, and Saturday [[Seudah Shlishit|late afternoon]]) and two holiday meals (one at night and lunch the following day) each begin with two complete loaves of bread.<ref>Maimonides (d. 1204), [http://kodesh.snunit.k12.il/i/3130.htm Mishneh Torah Hilchot Shabbos, Chapter 30, Law 9.] '''(Hebrew)'''</ref> This \"double loaf\" (in Hebrew: ''lechem mishneh'') commemorates the [[manna]] that fell from the heavens when the [[Israelites]] wandered in the desert after [[the Exodus]]. The manna did not fall on Sabbath or holidays; instead, a double portion would fall the day before the holiday or sabbath in order to last for both days.<ref>Sol Scharfstein, ''Understanding Jewish Holidays and Customs'', page 16 (1999)</ref>\n\nIn some customs, each loaf is woven with six strands of dough. Together, the loaves have twelve strands, alluding to the twelve loaves of the [[showbread]] offering in the Temple.  Other numbers of strands commonly used are three, five and seven.  Occasionally twelve are used, referred to as a \"Twelve Tribes\" challah.\n\n===Traditional Sabbath meal procedure===\n[[File:Shabbat Challos.jpg|right|thumb|Two homemade challot covered by a traditional [[embroidery|embroidered]] [[challah cover]]]]\n\nIt is customary to begin the evening and day Sabbath and holiday meals with the following sequence of rituals:\n\n* The challah is covered. It is customary to use a dedicated cloth called a [[challah cover]] for this purpose, although any improvised cover is acceptable.\n\nSomething, often what is called a Challah board, is under the Challah, although a simple napkin is acceptable if nothing else is available. The \"under\" and \"covering\" are to remind of the ''dew'' that fell, before and after the manna. It also serves as a cutting board for slicing the Challah.\n\n(Another reason for the cover is that normally, in the order of saying blessings, the ''challah'' would precede the wine; we therefore ''cover'' the challah's presence.)\n* [[Kiddush]] is recited over a cup of [[wine]].\n* Each attendee [[Handwashing in Judaism|ritually washes their hands]] in preparation for eating bread. (It is customary not to talk between this washing and consumption of the bread.<ref name=\"Salt\">{{cite web|title=Salt|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/13043-salt|work=Jewish Encyclopedia|accessdate=7 March 2013}}</ref>)\n* The challah cover is removed.\n* A knick is made in the bread with a cutting knife.\n* The two loaves are held up together.\n* The head of the household recites the blessing over bread: \"''Baruch atah Adonai, eloheinu melech ha'olam, hamotzi lechem (Le Khemekh) min ha'aretz''\" (Translation: \"Blessed are you [[Yahweh|{{Lord}}]] our God, King of the Universe, who brings forth bread from the earth\").\n* The bread is sliced (or torn, depending on [[minhag]]) and salted, and the pieces are distributed to each person at the meal to eat.\n\nThe specific practice varies. Some dip the bread into salt before the blessing on bread.<ref>{{cite book|title=Isserles, in Shulc\u1e25an 'Aruch, l.c}}</ref> Others say the blessing, cut or tear the challah into pieces, and only then dip the pieces in salt, or sprinkle them with salt, before they are eaten.<ref>Both practices are based on different parts of the same verse in Leviticus</ref>\n\nNormally, the custom is not to talk between washing hands and eating bread. However, according to some, if salt was not placed on the table, it is permitted to ask for someone to bring salt, before the blessing on bread is recited.<ref>{{cite book|title=[[Shulchan Aruch]], Ora\u1e25 \u1e24ayyim 167:5; Jacob Zausmer, \"Bet Ya'a\u1e33ob,\" No. 168; comp.

Customs vary whether the challah is dipped in salt, salt is sprinkled on it, or salt is merely present on the table.\n\nThe Torah requires that [[korban|Temple sacrifices]] to God be offered with salt.<ref>{{Bibleverse|Leviticus|2:13|HE}}</ref> Following the [[destruction of the Second Temple]], [[Rabbinic literature]] suggested that a table set for a meal symbolically replaces the Temple altar; therefore, the blessing over food should only be recited with salt present on the table.<ref name=\"Salt\"/> Should one eat a meal without performing a commandment, the covenant of salt protects him.<ref>Tosafot, Berachot 40a</ref>\n\nTo the rabbis, a meal without salt was considered no meal.<ref>Berachot 44a</ref> Furthermore, in the [[Torah]], salt symbolizes the eternal covenant between God and Israel.<ref name=\"Silberberg\">{{cite web|last=Silberberg|first=Naftali|title=Why is the Challah dipped in Salt|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/484194/jewish/Why-dip-in-salt.htm|publisher=Chabad.org|accessdate=7 March 2013}}</ref> As a preservative, salt never spoils or decays, signifying the immortality of this bond.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rabinowitz|first=Louis Isaac|title=Salt|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CCX2587517364&v=2.1&u=umd_um&it=r&p=GVRL&sw=w|work=Encyclopedia Judaica}}</ref>\n\n==Special challah==\n\n===Rosh Hashanah===\nOn [[Rosh Hashanah]], the Jewish New Year, the challah may be rolled into a circular shape (sometimes referred to as a \"turban challah\"), symbolizing the cycle of the year, and is sometimes baked with raisins in the dough. Some have the custom of continuing to eat circular challah from Rosh Hashana through the holiday of [[Sukkot]].\n\nSometimes the top is brushed with honey to symbolize the \"sweet new year.\" According to some traditions, challah eaten on Rosh Hashana is not dipped in or sprinkled with salt but instead is dipped in or sprinkled with honey. As above, some continue to use honey instead of salt through the Sukkot holiday.<ref>some keep the salt on the table, to not \"withhold\" salt from being present, per Lev. 2:13</ref>\n[[File:\u05d7\u05dc\u05ea \u05de\u05e4\u05ea\u05d7.jpg|thumb|Shlissel challah]]\n\n===Shlissel challah===\nFor the ''[[Special Shabbat#Shabbat Mevorchim|Shabbat Mevarchim]]'' preceding [[Rosh Chodesh]] [[Iyar]] (i.e., first ''Shabbat'' after the end of [[Passover]]), some Ashkenazi Jews have the custom of baking ''shlissel<ref>or schlissel</ref> challah'' (\"key challah\") as a ''[[Segula (Kabbalah)|segula]]'' (propitious sign) for ''parnassa'' (livelihood). Some make an impression of a key on top of the challah before baking, some place a key-shaped piece of dough on top of the challah before baking, and some bake an actual key inside the challah.<ref name=\"Key\">\"Second Thoughts: The Key to ''Parnassah''.\" ''Hamodia'', Feature Section, p. C3. 2009-04-23.</ref>\n\nThe earliest written source for this custom is the ''[[Sefer (Hebrew)|sefer]]'' ''Ohev Yisrael'' by Rabbi [[Avraham Yehoshua Heshel]], the Apter Rav, written in the 1800s. He calls ''schlissel challah'' \"an ancient custom,\" and offers several [[Kabbalah|kabbalistic]] interpretations. He writes that after spending forty years in the desert, the Israelites continued to eat the manna until they brought the [[Counting of the Omer|Omer]] offering on the second day of [[Passover]]. From that day on, they no longer ate manna, but food that had grown in the [[Land of Israel]]. Since they now had to start worrying about their sustenance rather than having it handed to them each morning, the key on the challah is a form of [[prayer]] to God to open up the gates of livelihood.<ref name=\"Key\" />\n\nThe custom has been criticized for allegedly having its source in Christian or pagan practices.<ref>Shelomo Alfassa, [http://www.mesora.org/Shlissel.html Shlissel Challah - \u201cThe Loaf of Idolatry?\u201d]</ref>\n\n===Challah rolls===\n''Shabbat'' challah, known as a ''bilkele'' or ''bulkele'' or ''bilkel'' or ''bulkel'' (plural: bilkelekh; {{lang-yi|\u05d1\u05d9\u05dc\u05e7\u05e2\u05dc\u05e2}}) baigiel (Polish) is a bread roll made with eggs, similar to a challah bun.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society.

South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

She also had supporting roles in [[Michel Gondry]]'s comedy ''[[Be Kind Rewind]]'' (2008), and [[Todd Solondz]]'s ''[[Dark Horse (2011 film)|Dark Horse]]'' (2011).\n\n==Film==\n[[File:Mia Farrow 1964.png|thumb|right|upright=.9|Farrow in ''Guns at Batasi'' (1964)]]\n[[File:Mia Farrow and Elizabeth Taylor in Secret Ceremony.jpg|thumb|upright=.9|right|Farrow and [[Elizabeth Taylor]] in ''Secret Ceremony'' (1968)]]\n[[File:Mia Farrow - Rosemary's Baby.jpg|thumb|upright=.9|right|Farrow in ''Rosemary's Baby'' (1968)]]\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"margin-right: 0;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" | Role\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Notes\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | {{Tooltip|Ref.|Reference}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1959\n| ''[[John Paul Jones (film)|John Paul Jones]]''\n|\n| Uncredited\n| align=center|<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/john_paul_jones|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|title=''John Paul Jones''|quote=Look for a very young Mia Farrow, daughter of the director John Farrow, in her feature film debut.|archive-url=https://archive.today/20190210101638/https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/john_paul_jones|archive-date=February 10, 2019|access-date=February 10, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1964\n| ''[[Guns at Batasi]]''\n| Karen Erickson\n|\n| align=center| <ref>{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Screen: African Adventure of 6 British Sergeants:' Guns at Batasi' Opens at Coronet Theater Richard Attenborough Stars in Melodrama|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/11/17/archives/screen-african-adventure-of-6-british-sergeants-guns-at-batasi.html?mtrref=www.google.com&gwh=DEA7505A08A40B75A0B7A5CC317AD780&gwt=pay|date=November 17, 1964|author=Weiler, A.

The daughter of actress [[Maureen O'Sullivan]] and director [[John Farrow]], she had an uncredited appearance in ''[[John Paul Jones]]'' (1959) before making her feature debut in ''[[Guns at Batasi]]'' (1964), for which she earned a [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe]] for [[Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year \u2013 Actress|New Star of the Year]]. From 1964 to 1966, she portrayed [[Allison MacKenzie]] on the dramatic television series ''[[Peyton Place (TV series)|Peyton Place]]''.\n\nFarrow subsequently earned critical and commercial recognition for her leading role in [[Roman Polanski]]'s horror film ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'' (1968), followed by further critical attention for her role opposite [[Dustin Hoffman]] in the drama ''[[John and Mary (film)|John and Mary]]'' (1969). Throughout the 1970s, Farrow appeared in numerous stage productions abroad, and became the first American actress to join the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]].{{Sfn|Bartrop|2012|p=86}} She also appeared in film during this period, notably portraying [[Daisy Buchanan]] in [[Paramount Pictures]]' film adaptation of ''[[The Great Gatsby (1974 film)|The Great Gatsby]]'' (1974). Beginning with 1982's ''[[A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy]]'', Farrow would spend much of the 1980s and early-1990s appearing in films directed by her then-partner [[Woody Allen]], including ''[[The Purple Rose of Cairo]]'' (1985), ''[[Hannah and Her Sisters]]'' (1987), and ''[[Alice (1990 film)|Alice]]'' (1990), for each of which she received [[List of awards and nominations received by Mia Farrow|critical accolades]].\n\nLater credits include the 1999 independent film ''[[Coming Soon (1999 film)|Coming Soon]]'', the horror remake ''[[The Omen (2006 film)|The Omen]]'' (2006), and the romantic comedy ''[[The Ex (2006 film)|The Ex]]'' (2007). Farrow also provided voice work playing Daisy Suchot in [[Luc Besson]]'s animated film ''[[Arthur and the Invisibles]]'' (2006), and reprised the role for its two sequels, ''[[Arthur and the Revenge of Maltazard]]'' (2009) and ''[[Arthur 3: The War of the Two Worlds]]'' (2010).

Twelve years later, Kara, working at CatCo Worldwide Media, reveals her powers as a vigilante. She tells her co-worker, [[Winn Schott]], about her secret and he starts aiding her.

[[Alex Danvers|Alex]], Kara's adoptive sister, works at the [[Department of Extranormal Operations|Department of Extranormal Operations (DEO)]], under the leadership of [[Hank Henshaw]], investigating alien activity. Kara learns that there are hundreds of aliens on Earth, most of whom came from a prison that was run by her mother, [[Alura (DC Comics)|Alura]].

The website's consensus reads, \"Melissa Benoist shines as Superman's plucky little cousin in ''Supergirl'', a family-friendly comic-book adaptation that ditches cynicism for heart.\"<ref name=\"RT\" /> [[Metacritic]], which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 75 out of 100 based on 33 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".<ref name=\"MC\" /> Max Nicholson of ''[[IGN]]'' gave the season a score of 7.3 out of 10, along with the verdict, \"While Supergirl's first season disappointed in several key areas -- namely its villains and romantic subplots -- Supergirl herself was spot-on, and the story offered several surprising twists (e.g., Hank Henshaw as J'onn J'onzz). Yes, not all episodes were winners, but when the series flew, it soared, especially in terms of emotional impact.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/26/supergirl-season-1-review

Campbell of ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' criticized the costumes, fight sequences, the ludicrous villains, the predictable nature of the plot, and felt that the title character was not \"Super

Yes, not all episodes were winners, but when the series flew, it soared, especially in terms of emotional impact.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/26/supergirl-season-1-review

She is kind towards the children, but can be firm when needed. She is \"practically perfect in every way\". In the film version, she is a young woman, with an air of grace and elegance about her.\n\nAuthor P. L. Travers was very firm about Mary Poppins' appearance in the novel's illustrations, working closely with illustrator [[Mary Shepard]] to create an image of the character. Eventually they based Mary Poppins' appearance on that of a [[Dutch doll]]: tall and bony, with short black hair, large blue eyes, a snub nose, and a prim, pursed mouth. Travers originally objected to the casting of [[Julie Andrews]] as Mary Poppins, claiming that Andrews was too attractive for the role; however, upon meeting Andrews in person for the first time, Travers allegedly examined the actress for a few moments before conceding, \"Well, you've the nose for it.\"<ref>Lawson, Valerie. \"The Americanization of Mary\". Mary Poppins, She Wrote: The Life of P.&nbsp;L. Travers. 1st ed. New York: Simon & Schuster, 2006. 216. Print.</ref>\n\n===Books===\n{{Main|Mary Poppins (book series)}}\n[[File:Shepard-Mary-Poppins.jpg|thumb|right|Mary Poppins as imagined by the illustrator of the book series, [[Mary Shepard]], for the first volume]]\nMary Poppins in Travers' books is strict and no-nonsense, asserting her unusual brand of discipline over the four (later five) Banks children in her charge. Mary is very vain and is always admiring herself in the mirror and other reflections. She constantly scolds the children for their \"bad\" behaviour, especially when they point out the magical things she does, for she constantly denies she is anything but a prim and proper lady. Mary only shows her gentler side around her friends, among them the Matchman (Bert), Mrs. Corry, and Nellie-Rubina.\n\nMary has many relatives, each with their own supernatural or otherwise eccentric nature, at least one of whom appears in each book. She appears to be well known to every sort of magical entity (sorcerers, talking animals, etc.) that appear in the books, some of whom love her dearly and others who are quite terrified of her. Some characters, most notably an impudent [[jackdaw]] seen in the first two books, call her \"The Great Exception\", meaning, among other things, that she is the only human being who has retained the magical secrets infants possess (such as the power to communicate with animals) until they grow up and forget about them. Some of her adventures occur in [[London]], others in strange realms, which later writers might identify as magical [[dimension]]s. In literary terms, she might be described as a character who exists in every conceivable [[fantasy]] genre (gothic, mythic, urban, etc.) at once: there are many strange people and phenomena in the world, but only Mary Poppins is familiar with them all. In the first book, Poppins arrives at Number Seventeen Cherry Tree Lane, London, home of the Banks family, with her travelling [[carpet bag]], having been blown in by the [[east wind]]. She departs when she opens her umbrella, and the [[west wind]] carries her away.\n\n===Films===\nMary Poppins in the [[Mary Poppins (film)|Disney film]], as portrayed by [[Julie Andrews]], is also fairly stern but at the same time more gentle, cheerful, and nurturing of the two Banks children, of whom she is in charge. Mary also has a friendship with [[Bert (Mary Poppins)|Bert]] ([[Dick Van Dyke]]), a [[jack of all trades, master of none|jack-of-all-trades]], who is quite at home with Mary's brand of magic. She also is less vain and selfish (although there are a couple of references to her vanity when she replaces a dingy wall mirror with a more elegant one and sings a duet with her reflection), and far more sympathetic towards the two children than the nanny in the original stories. [[Emily Blunt]] portrayed Mary Poppins in the sequel ''[[Mary Poppins Returns]]''.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kroll |first1=Justin |title='Hamilton's' Lin-Manuel Miranda in Talks for 'Mary Poppins' Sequel (EXCLUSIVE) |url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/hamilton-lin-manuel-miranda-mary-poppins-sequel-1201713853/ |accessdate=February 26, 2016 |work=Variety |date=February 24, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title='Mary Poppins' Sequel Gets Title & Release Date From Disney |last=Pedersen |first=Erik |url=http://deadline.com/2016/05/mary-poppins-returns-sequel-release-date-lin-manuel-miranda-emily-blunt-1201764956/ |publisher=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=May 31, 2016 |accessdate=May 31, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Stage musical===\n\n{{quote box|width=30%|bgcolor=#FFFFF0|align=right|quote=\"Even though it's set in Edwardian London, it's about family, and it's about appreciating one another.

She is kind towards the children, but can be firm when needed. She is \"practically perfect in every way\". In the film version, she is a young woman, with an air of grace and elegance about her.\n\nAuthor P. L. Travers was very firm about Mary Poppins' appearance in the novel's illustrations, working closely with illustrator [[Mary Shepard]] to create an image of the character. Eventually they based Mary Poppins' appearance on that of a [[Dutch doll]]: tall and bony, with short black hair, large blue eyes, a snub nose, and a prim, pursed mouth. Travers originally objected to the casting of [[Julie Andrews]] as Mary Poppins, claiming that Andrews was too attractive for the role; however, upon meeting Andrews in person for the first time, Travers allegedly examined the actress for a few moments before conceding, \"Well, you've the nose for it.\"<ref>Lawson, Valerie. \"The Americanization of Mary\". Mary Poppins, She Wrote: The Life of P.&nbsp;L. Travers. 1st ed. New York: Simon & Schuster, 2006. 216. Print.</ref>\n\n===Books===\n{{Main|Mary Poppins (book series)}}\n[[File:Shepard-Mary-Poppins.jpg|thumb|right|Mary Poppins as imagined by the illustrator of the book series, [[Mary Shepard]], for the first volume]]\nMary Poppins in Travers' books is strict and no-nonsense, asserting her unusual brand of discipline over the four (later five) Banks children in her charge. Mary is very vain and is always admiring herself in the mirror and other reflections. She constantly scolds the children for their \"bad\" behaviour, especially when they point out the magical things she does, for she constantly denies she is anything but a prim and proper lady. Mary only shows her gentler side around her friends, among them the Matchman (Bert), Mrs. Corry, and Nellie-Rubina.\n\nMary has many relatives, each with their own supernatural or otherwise eccentric nature, at least one of whom appears in each book. She appears to be well known to every sort of magical entity (sorcerers, talking animals, etc.) that appear in the books, some of whom love her dearly and others who are quite terrified of her. Some characters, most notably an impudent [[jackdaw]] seen in the first two books, call her \"The Great Exception\", meaning, among other things, that she is the only human being who has retained the magical secrets infants possess (such as the power to communicate with animals) until they grow up and forget about them. Some of her adventures occur in [[London]], others in strange realms, which later writers might identify as magical [[dimension]]s. In literary terms, she might be described as a character who exists in every conceivable [[fantasy]] genre (gothic, mythic, urban, etc.) at once: there are many strange people and phenomena in the world, but only Mary Poppins is familiar with them all. In the first book, Poppins arrives at Number Seventeen Cherry Tree Lane, London, home of the Banks family, with her travelling [[carpet bag]], having been blown in by the [[east wind]]. She departs when she opens her umbrella, and the [[west wind]] carries her away.\n\n===Films===\nMary Poppins in the [[Mary Poppins (film)|Disney film]], as portrayed by [[Julie Andrews]], is also fairly stern but at the same time more gentle, cheerful, and nurturing of the two Banks children, of whom she is in charge. Mary also has a friendship with [[Bert (Mary Poppins)|Bert]] ([[Dick Van Dyke]]), a [[jack of all trades, master of none|jack-of-all-trades]], who is quite at home with Mary's brand of magic. She also is less vain and selfish (although there are a couple of references to her vanity when she replaces a dingy wall mirror with a more elegant one and sings a duet with her reflection), and far more sympathetic towards the two children than the nanny in the original stories.

Covering the southern part of the [[peninsula]]r [[Deccan Plateau]], South India is bounded by the [[Bay of Bengal]] in the east, the [[Arabian Sea]] in the west and the [[Indian Ocean]] in the south. The geography of the region is diverse with two mountain ranges - the [[Western Ghats|Western]] and [[Eastern Ghats]], bordering the [[plateau]] heartland. [[Godavari River|Godavari]], [[Krishna River|Krishna]], [[Kaveri River|Kaveri]], [[Tungabhadra River|Tungabhadra]] and [[Vaigai River|Vaigai]] rivers are important non-[[Perennial stream|perennial]] sources of water. [[Chennai]], [[Bangalore]], [[Hyderabad]], [[Coimbatore]], [[Kochi]], [[Visakhapatnam]], [[Madurai]], [[Mysore]], [[Kozhikode]], [[Tiruchirappalli]], [[Thiruvananthapuram]], [[Mangalore]], [[Warangal]] are some of the major cities.\n\nThe majority of the people in South India speak one of the four major [[Dravidian languages]]: [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Kannada]] and [[Malayalam]]. During its [[History of South India|history]], a number of dynastic kingdoms ruled over parts of South India whose invasions across [[South Asia|southern]] and [[Southeast Asia|southeastern]] Asia impacted the history and culture in those regions. Major dynasties that were established in South India include the [[Chera dynasty|Cheras]], [[Chola dynasty|Cholas]], [[Pandyan dynasty|Pandyas]], [[Pallava dynasty|Pallavas]], [[Satavahana dynasty|Satavahanas]], [[Chalukya dynasty|Chalukyas]], [[Rashtrakuta dynasty|Rashtrakutas]] and [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagara]]. European countries entered India through Kerala and the region was [[colonialism|colonised]] by [[British East India|Britain]] and other Western European countries.\n\nAfter experiencing fluctuations in the decades immediately after [[Indian independence movement|Indian independence]], the economies of South Indian states have registered higher than national average growth over the past three decades. While South Indian states have improved in some [[socio-economics|socio-economic]] metrics, poverty continues to affect the region much like the rest of the country, although it has considerably decreased over the years. [[Human Development Index|HDI]] in the southern states is high and the economy has undergone growth at a faster rate than most northern states. [[Literacy in India|Literacy rates]] in the southern states are higher than the national average with approximately 81% of the population capable of reading and writing. The [[fertility rate]] in South India is 1.9, the lowest of all regions in India.\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:Dravida nadu.jpg|thumb|South India]]\nSouth India, also known as Peninsular India, has been known by several other names.
