Meant as an alternative to the [[condom]] for males, it was invented by Danish [[Medical Doctor|MD]] [[Lasse Hessel]] and is worn internally by the female partner to prevent exposure to ejaculated [[semen]] or other body fluids.

They typically come in various sizes. For most vaginas, a moderately sized condom is adequate; women who have recently given birth should try a large size first. The inner ring or foam disc at the closed end of the sheath is used to insert the condom inside the vagina and to hold it in place during intercourse. The rolled outer ring or poly frame at the open end of the sheath remains outside the vagina and covers part of the external genitalia.\n\nThe female condom was developed in the late 20th century (male condoms have been used for centuries). A primary motive for its creation is the well-documented refusal of some men to use a condom because of loss of sensation and the resulting impact on the hardness of the man's [[erection]], and secondarily by its implication that the male could transmit an STI.<ref>National Health Service (United Kingdom), \"What if my partner won't use condoms?\", July 16, 2014, http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/contraception-guide/Pages/partner-wont-use-condoms.aspx, retrieved February 8, 2017.</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Geter |first1=Angelica |last2=Crosby |first2=Richard |title=Condom Refusal and Young Black Men: the Influence of Pleasure, Sexual Partners, and Friends |journal=Journal of Urban Health |date=2014 |volume=91 |issue=3 |pages=541\u2013546 |doi=10.1007/s11524-014-9869-4 |pmid=24777393 |pmc=4074317 }}</ref>\n\n==Versions and materials==\n[[file:Female Condom.png|thumb|left|200px|An illustration of a female condom]]\n[[Image:ReddyFc.png|thumb|left|VA wow brand female condom]]\nThe FC1 female condom was first made from [[polyurethane]].

At each end there is a flexible ring. At the closed end of the sheath, the flexible ring is inserted into the vagina to hold the female condom in place. The other end of the sheath stays outside the [[vulva]] at the entrance to the vagina. This ring acts as a guide during penetration and stops the sheath from shifting during intercourse. There is a silicone-based lubricant on the inside of the condom, but additional lubrication can be used. The condom does not contain spermicide.\n\n===VA W.o.W.===\nThe VA w.o.w.\u00ae Condom Feminine is manufactured by HLL Lifecare Ltd and IXu LLC.

The Woman's Condom is a polyurethane pouch that is partially enclosed in a capsule to aid insertion. The capsule dissolves quickly after insertion in the vagina, which releases the pouch. The condom is then held stable in the woman by foam pads. The Woman's Condom is packaged dry and comes with a small sachet of water-based lubricant to be applied at point of use. PATH licensed manufacturing and distribution of the Woman's Condom to the Shanghai Dahua Medical Apparatus Company in 2008. Dahua has received the South Africa Bureau of Standards (SABS) certification marking (2013), Shanghai Food and Drug Administration Approval (2011), and the CE Mark approval (2010) for the Woman's Condom, which allows for marketing and distribution of the product in South Africa, China and Europe, respectively.

Female condoms cost, on average, US$2\u20134, depending on local market factors. At the 2012 Family Planning Summit in London, the Female Health Company pledged to increase access to the FC2\u00ae female condom for the world's poorest countries and announced a prospective pricing arrangement based on aggregate purchases and 5 percent free goods based on the prior year's purchases, together with a multiyear agreement to provide $14 million in training and education by FHC over the next six years.\n\nThe Cupid\u2122 female condoms have been sold in Kyrgyz Republic through UNFPA for their public distribution system.

They typically come in various sizes. For most vaginas, a moderately sized condom is adequate; women who have recently given birth should try a large size first. The inner ring or foam disc at the closed end of the sheath is used to insert the condom inside the vagina and to hold it in place during intercourse. The rolled outer ring or poly frame at the open end of the sheath remains outside the vagina and covers part of the external genitalia.\n\nThe female condom was developed in the late 20th century (male condoms have been used for centuries). A primary motive for its creation is the well-documented refusal of some men to use a condom because of loss of sensation and the resulting impact on the hardness of the man's [[erection]], and secondarily by its implication that the male could transmit an STI.<ref>National Health Service (United Kingdom), \"What if my partner won't use condoms?\", July 16, 2014, http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/contraception-guide/Pages/partner-wont-use-condoms.aspx, retrieved February 8, 2017.</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Geter |first1=Angelica |last2=Crosby |first2=Richard |title=Condom Refusal and Young Black Men: the Influence of Pleasure, Sexual Partners, and Friends |journal=Journal of Urban Health |date=2014 |volume=91 |issue=3 |pages=541\u2013546 |doi=10.1007/s11524-014-9869-4 |pmid=24777393 |pmc=4074317 }}</ref>\n\n==Versions and materials==\n[[file:Female Condom.png|thumb|left|200px|An illustration of a female condom]]\n[[Image:ReddyFc.png|thumb|left|VA wow brand female condom]]\nThe FC1 female condom was first made from [[polyurethane]].

At each end there is a flexible ring. At the closed end of the sheath, the flexible ring is inserted into the vagina to hold the female condom in place. The other end of the sheath stays outside the [[vulva]] at the entrance to the vagina. This ring acts as a guide during penetration and stops the sheath from shifting during intercourse. There is a silicone-based lubricant on the inside of the condom, but additional lubrication can be used. The condom does not contain spermicide.\n\n===VA W.o.W.===\nThe VA w.o.w.\u00ae Condom Feminine is manufactured by HLL Lifecare Ltd and IXu LLC. This latex condom has a pouch attached to its rounded triangular opening and a sponge to secure it inside a woman's vagina. It is available through the distributor IXu LLC for the private and public sectors in several regions, including the EU, South Africa, Brazil, and India. The VA w.o.w.\u00ae received the CE mark, a certification that it meets European Union consumer health requirements.

The Woman's Condom is a polyurethane pouch that is partially enclosed in a capsule to aid insertion. The capsule dissolves quickly after insertion in the vagina, which releases the pouch. The condom is then held stable in the woman by foam pads. The Woman's Condom is packaged dry and comes with a small sachet of water-based lubricant to be applied at point of use. PATH licensed manufacturing and distribution of the Woman's Condom to the Shanghai Dahua Medical Apparatus Company in 2008. Dahua has received the South Africa Bureau of Standards (SABS) certification marking (2013), Shanghai Food and Drug Administration Approval (2011), and the CE Mark approval (2010) for the Woman's Condom, which allows for marketing and distribution of the product in South Africa, China and Europe, respectively.

The OFC is in clinical trials in San Francisco, CA in collaboration with the Women's Global Health Imperative at RTI, International. Large-scale clinical trials were to follow in 2014, to evaluate its performance and safety. It had been expected to reach the market in late 2015, pending regulatory pre-market approvals.

Female condoms cost, on average, US$2\u20134, depending on local market factors. At the 2012 Family Planning Summit in London, the Female Health Company pledged to increase access to the FC2\u00ae female condom for the world's poorest countries and announced a prospective pricing arrangement based on aggregate purchases and 5 percent free goods based on the prior year's purchases, together with a multiyear agreement to provide $14 million in training and education by FHC over the next six years.\n\nThe Cupid\u2122 female condoms have been sold in Kyrgyz Republic through UNFPA for their public distribution system.

For each title, Common Sense Media indicates the age for which a title is either appropriate or most relevant.

It said that 81 percent expressed concern that the media in general were encouraging violent or [[Anti-social behaviour|antisocial]] behavior in children.\u201d The polling firm, Penn, Schoen & Berland Associates, said that \u201conly one out of five interviewed \u2018fully trusted' the separate industry-controlled ratings systems for music, movies, video games and television.\u201d<ref name=\"NYT\"/>\n\n==Entertainment reviews==\nCommon Sense Media reviews thousands of movies, TV shows, music, video games, [[Mobile apps|apps]], web sites and books. Based on developmental criteria, the reviews provide guidance regarding each title's age appropriateness, as well as a \u201ccontent grid\u201d that rates particular aspects of the title including [[Education|educational value]], [[violence]], sex, gender messages and role models, and more. For each title, Common Sense Media indicates the age for which a title is either appropriate or most relevant. An overall five-star quality rating is also included, as are [[discussion]] questions to help families talk about their entertainment. In addition to Common Sense Media's traditional rating system, they also offer a set of learning based ratings, which are designed to determine complex educational values.<ref name=\"FC\">{{cite web\n | url        = http://www.fastcoexist.com/1679657/transforming-the-market-for-kids-media-by-rating-its-educational-value\n | title      = Transforming The Market For Kids\u2019 Media By Rating Its Educational Value\n | last       = Kamenetz\n | first      = Anya\n | date       = \n | work       = \n | publisher  = Fast Company\n | accessdate = September 17, 2012\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=About Our Ratings |publisher=Common Sense Media |accessdate=December 11, 2011 |url=http://www.commonsensemedia.org/about-us/our-mission/about-our-ratings}}</ref>\n\nCommon Sense Media partners with a number of media companies that distribute the organization's free content to more than 100 million homes in the United States.

Iron and steel production was identified as a key requirement for economic advancement. Millions of peasants were ordered away from agricultural work to join the iron and steel production workforce.\n\nIn 2008, [[Yang Jisheng (historian)|Yang Jisheng]] would summarize the effect of the focus on production targets :\n<blockquote>In [[Xinyang]], people starved at the doors of the grain warehouses. As they died, they shouted, \"Communist Party, Chairman Mao, save us\". If the granaries of [[Henan]] and [[Hebei]] had been opened, no one need have died.

The theory was that plants of the same species would not compete with each other. In natural cycles they did fully compete, which actually stunted growth and resulted in lower yields.\n\nAnother implemented policy (known as \"[[deep plowing]]\") was based on the ideas of Lysenko's colleague [[Terentiy Maltsev]], who encouraged peasants across China to eschew normal [[plowing]] depths of 15\u201320 centimeters and instead plow extremely deeply into the soil (1 to 2 meters). The deep plowing theory stated that the most fertile soil was deep in the earth, and plowing unusually deep would allow extra strong root growth. However, in shallow soil, useless rocks, soil, and sand were driven up instead, burying the fertile topsoil and severely stunting seedling growth.\n\n==== Four Pest Campaign ====\n[[File:Tree-Sparrow-2009-16-02.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|The [[Eurasian tree sparrow]] was the most notable target of the [[Four Pests Campaign]]]]\n\nAdditionally, in the [[Four Pests Campaign]], citizens were called upon to destroy sparrows and other wild birds that ate crop seeds, in order to protect fields. Pest birds were shot down or scared away from landing until dropping in exhaustion. This system failed and resulted in an explosion of the vermin population, especially crop-eating insects, which consequently had no predators.\n\n==== Illusion of superabundance ====\nSince 1957, the [[Communist Party of China]] had began to report excessive production of grains. However, the actual production of grains throughout China was decreasing from 1957\u20131961. For examples,  \n\n* In [[Sichuan Province]], even though the collected grain was decreasing from 1958\u20131961, the numbers reported to the central government kept increasing.<ref name=\"Jisheng2012\">{{cite book|author=Yang Jisheng|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nadqrYU10eMC|title=Tombstone: The Great Chinese Famine, 1958\u20131962|date=30 October 2012|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0-374-27793-2|page=240}}</ref>\n* In [[Gansu]], the grain yield declined by 4,273,000 tonnes from 1957 to 1961.<ref>{{cite book|author=Yang Jisheng|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nadqrYU10eMC|title=Tombstone: The Great Chinese Famine, 1958-1962|date=30 October 2012|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0-374-27793-2|page=126}}</ref> \n\nThis series of events resulted in an \"illusion of superabundance\", and the Party believed that they had an excess amount of grains. On the contrary, the crop yields were in fact lower than average.

Yang Dali states that there were three main consequences from the illusion of superabundance:<ref>{{cite book|author=Dali L. Yang|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VmLuoAkMKrkC|title=Calamity and Reform in China: State, Rural Society, and Institutional Change Since the Great Leap Famine|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1996|isbn=978-0-8047-3470-7|page=65}}</ref> <blockquote>First, it led to planners to shift lands from grain to economic crops, such as cotton, sugarcane, and beets, and divert huge numbers agricultural laborers into industrial sectors, fueling state demand for procured grain from the countryside. Second, it prompted the Chinese leadership, especially [[Zhou Enlai]], to speed up grain exports to secure more foreign currency to purchase capital goods needed for industrialization. Finally, the illusion of superabundance made the adoption of the commune mess halls seem rational at the time. All these changes, of course, contributed to the rapid exhaustion of grain supplies.</blockquote>\n\n=== More policies from the central government ===\nEconomists Xin Meng, [[Nancy Qian]] and Pierre Yared showed that, much like [[Amartya Sen]]'s earlier claims, aggregate production was sufficient for avoiding famine and that the famine was caused by over-procurement and poor distribution within the country. They show that unlike most other famines, there was surprisingly more deaths in places that produced more food per capita and argue that the inflexibility in the centrally planned food procurement system explains at least half of the famine mortality.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Meng|first=Xin|last2=Qian|first2=Nancy|last3=Yared|first3=Pierre|date=2015-10-01|title=The Institutional Causes of China's Great Famine, 1959\u20131961|url=https://academic.oup.com/restud/article/82/4/1568/2607347|journal=The Review of Economic Studies|volume=82|issue=4|pages=1568\u20131611|doi=10.1093/restud/rdv016|issn=0034-6527}}</ref> Economic historians James Kung and Shuo Chen show that there was more over procurement in places where politicians faced more competition.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kung|first=James Kai-Sing|last2=Chen|first2=Shuo|date=February 2011|title=The Tragedy of the Nomenklatura: Career Incentives and Political Radicalism during China's Great Leap Famine|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=105|issue=1|pages=27\u201345|doi=10.1017/S0003055410000626|issn=1537-5943}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, policies from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the central government that were implemented, particularly the [[Three Red Banners]] and the [[Socialist Education Movement]] (SEM), proved to be ideologically detrimental to the aggrevating famine. The Three Red Banners of the CCP \"sparked the fanaticism of 1958\"  and the implementation of the [[Mass line|Mass Line]], one of the three banners which told people to, \"go all out, aim high, and build socialism with greater, better, and more economical results\" directly links to the pressures officials felt when reporting a superabundance of grain.<ref>{{cite book|author=Yang Jisheng|title=Tombstone: The Great Chinese Famine, 1958\u20131962|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nadqrYU10eMC|date=30 October 2012|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0-374-27793-2|page=87}}</ref> The SEM, established in 1957, also led to the severity of the famine in various ways, including causing the illusion of superabundance.

By enforcing such passivity at a local level while there already was passivity at an official level, speaking and acting against the famine became a seemingly impossible task.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|page=110|chapter=\"The Grain Problem is an Ideological Problem\" : Discourses of Hunger in the 1957 Socialist Education Campaign}}</ref>\n\nThe influence of local government in the famine can be seen in the comparison between the provinces of Anhui and Jiangxi.

Zeng proposed agricultural projects without consulting colleagues which caused Anhui's agriculture to fail terribly.  Zhang Kaifan, a party secretary and deputy-governor of the province, heard rumours of a famine breaking out in Anhui and disagreed with many of Zeng's policies. Zeng reported Zhang to Mao for such speculations which led Mao to label Zhang \"a member of the 'Peng Dehuai anti-Party military clique,'\" resulting in him being purged from the local party. Zeng was unable to report of the famine when it became an emergency situation as this would prove his hypocrisy and caused him to become a \"blatant political radical who almost single-handedly damaged Anhui.\"<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|pages=213|chapter=Under the Same Maoist Sky : Accounting for Death Rate Discrepancies in Anhui and Jiangxi}}</ref>\n\nJiangxi encountered a situation almost opposite to that of Anhui. The leaders of Jiangxi publicly opposed some of the Great Leap programs, quietly made themselves unavailable, and even appeared to take a passive attitude towards the Maoist economy. As the leaders worked collaboratively among themselves, they also worked with the local population as well. By being able to create an environment in which the Great Leap Forward did not become fully implemented, the Jiangxi government \"did their best to minimize damage\u2026\" These findings concluded that much of the severity of the famine came down to provincial leaders and their responsibility for their regions.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|pages=216\u2013218|chapter=Under the Same Maoist Sky : Accounting for Death Rate Discrepancies in Anhui and Jiangxi}}</ref>\n\n=== Natural disasters ===\nIn July 1959, the [[Yellow River]] flooded in [[East China]].

But the numbers were faked, and so were the fields that Mao observed, which had been carefully prepared in advance of Mao's visit by local officials, who removed shoots of grain from various fields and carefully transplanted them into a field prepared especially for Mao, which appeared to be a bumper crop.<ref name=\"becker\" />{{rp|122}}\n\nThe local officials became trapped by these sham demonstrations to Mao, and exhorted the peasants to reach unattainable goals, by \"deep ploughing and close planting\", and other techniques. This ended up making things much worse, the crop failed completely, leaving barren fields. No one was in a position to challenge Mao's ideas as incorrect, so peasants pulled out their bedding and coats into the fields, added seeds and water, and after they sprouted, buried the materials under the soil once the seedlings were high enough.<ref name=\"becker\" />{{rp|122}}\n\nIn a similar manner to the massive Soviet-created famine in Ukraine (the [[Holodomor]]), doctors were prohibited from listing \"starvation\" as a cause of death on death certificates. This kind of deception was far from uncommon; a famous [[propaganda]] picture from the famine shows Chinese children from [[Shandong]] province ostensibly standing atop a field of wheat, so densely grown that it could apparently support their weight.

In natural cycles they did fully compete, which actually stunted growth and resulted in lower yields.\n\nAnother implemented policy (known as \"[[deep plowing]]\") was based on the ideas of Lysenko's colleague [[Terentiy Maltsev]], who encouraged peasants across China to eschew normal [[plowing]] depths of 15\u201320 centimeters and instead plow extremely deeply into the soil (1 to 2 meters). The deep plowing theory stated that the most fertile soil was deep in the earth, and plowing unusually deep would allow extra strong root growth. However, in shallow soil, useless rocks, soil, and sand were driven up instead, burying the fertile topsoil and severely stunting seedling growth.\n\n==== Four Pest Campaign ====\n[[File:Tree-Sparrow-2009-16-02.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|The [[Eurasian tree sparrow]] was the most notable target of the [[Four Pests Campaign]]]]\n\nAdditionally, in the [[Four Pests Campaign]], citizens were called upon to destroy sparrows and other wild birds that ate crop seeds, in order to protect fields. Pest birds were shot down or scared away from landing until dropping in exhaustion. This system failed and resulted in an explosion of the vermin population, especially crop-eating insects, which consequently had no predators.\n\n==== Illusion of superabundance ====\nSince 1957, the [[Communist Party of China]] had began to report excessive production of grains. However, the actual production of grains throughout China was decreasing from 1957\u20131961. For examples,  \n\n* In [[Sichuan Province]], even though the collected grain was decreasing from 1958\u20131961, the numbers reported to the central government kept increasing.<ref name=\"Jisheng2012\">{{cite book|author=Yang Jisheng|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nadqrYU10eMC|title=Tombstone: The Great Chinese Famine, 1958\u20131962|date=30 October 2012|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0-374-27793-2|page=240}}</ref>\n* In [[Gansu]], the grain yield declined by 4,273,000 tonnes from 1957 to 1961.<ref>{{cite book|author=Yang Jisheng|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nadqrYU10eMC|title=Tombstone: The Great Chinese Famine, 1958-1962|date=30 October 2012|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0-374-27793-2|page=126}}</ref> \n\nThis series of events resulted in an \"illusion of superabundance\", and the Party believed that they had an excess amount of grains. On the contrary, the crop yields were in fact lower than average.

Yang Dali states that there were three main consequences from the illusion of superabundance:<ref>{{cite book|author=Dali L.

Second, it prompted the Chinese leadership, especially [[Zhou Enlai]], to speed up grain exports to secure more foreign currency to purchase capital goods needed for industrialization. Finally, the illusion of superabundance made the adoption of the commune mess halls seem rational at the time. All these changes, of course, contributed to the rapid exhaustion of grain supplies.</blockquote>\n\n=== More policies from the central government ===\nEconomists Xin Meng, [[Nancy Qian]] and Pierre Yared showed that, much like [[Amartya Sen]]'s earlier claims, aggregate production was sufficient for avoiding famine and that the famine was caused by over-procurement and poor distribution within the country. They show that unlike most other famines, there was surprisingly more deaths in places that produced more food per capita and argue that the inflexibility in the centrally planned food procurement system explains at least half of the famine mortality.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Meng|first=Xin|last2=Qian|first2=Nancy|last3=Yared|first3=Pierre|date=2015-10-01|title=The Institutional Causes of China's Great Famine, 1959\u20131961|url=https://academic.oup.com/restud/article/82/4/1568/2607347|journal=The Review of Economic Studies|volume=82|issue=4|pages=1568\u20131611|doi=10.1093/restud/rdv016|issn=0034-6527}}</ref> Economic historians James Kung and Shuo Chen show that there was more over procurement in places where politicians faced more competition.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kung|first=James Kai-Sing|last2=Chen|first2=Shuo|date=February 2011|title=The Tragedy of the Nomenklatura: Career Incentives and Political Radicalism during China's Great Leap Famine|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=105|issue=1|pages=27\u201345|doi=10.1017/S0003055410000626|issn=1537-5943}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, policies from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the central government that were implemented, particularly the [[Three Red Banners]] and the [[Socialist Education Movement]] (SEM), proved to be ideologically detrimental to the aggrevating famine. The Three Red Banners of the CCP \"sparked the fanaticism of 1958\"  and the implementation of the [[Mass line|Mass Line]], one of the three banners which told people to, \"go all out, aim high, and build socialism with greater, better, and more economical results\" directly links to the pressures officials felt when reporting a superabundance of grain.<ref>{{cite book|author=Yang Jisheng|title=Tombstone: The Great Chinese Famine, 1958\u20131962|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nadqrYU10eMC|date=30 October 2012|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0-374-27793-2|page=87}}</ref> The SEM, established in 1957, also led to the severity of the famine in various ways, including causing the illusion of superabundance.

As the Great Leap Forward progressed, many provincial leaders began to extend their reach by working closely with Mao and higher Party leaders; which, in turn resulted in these provincial leaders abusing power that they did not actually have.<ref>{{cite book|author=Dali L.

This hatred led to peasants becoming unable to openly speak on collectivization and state grain purchase. By enforcing such passivity at a local level while there already was passivity at an official level, speaking and acting against the famine became a seemingly impossible task.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|page=110|chapter=\"The Grain Problem is an Ideological Problem\" : Discourses of Hunger in the 1957 Socialist Education Campaign}}</ref>\n\nThe influence of local government in the famine can be seen in the comparison between the provinces of Anhui and Jiangxi. Anhui, having a radical pro-Mao government, was led by [[Zeng Xisheng]] who was \"dictatorial\" with ties to Mao.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|pages=212\u2013213|chapter=Under the Same Maoist Sky : Accounting for Death Rate Discrepancies in Anhui and Jiangxi}}</ref> Zeng firmly believed in the Great Leap Forward and tried to hold relationships with higher officials rather than keep close local ties. Zeng proposed agricultural projects without consulting colleagues which caused Anhui's agriculture to fail terribly.  Zhang Kaifan, a party secretary and deputy-governor of the province, heard rumours of a famine breaking out in Anhui and disagreed with many of Zeng's policies. Zeng reported Zhang to Mao for such speculations which led Mao to label Zhang \"a member of the 'Peng Dehuai anti-Party military clique,'\" resulting in him being purged from the local party. Zeng was unable to report of the famine when it became an emergency situation as this would prove his hypocrisy and caused him to become a \"blatant political radical who almost single-handedly damaged Anhui.\"<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|pages=213|chapter=Under the Same Maoist Sky : Accounting for Death Rate Discrepancies in Anhui and Jiangxi}}</ref>\n\nJiangxi encountered a situation almost opposite to that of Anhui. The leaders of Jiangxi publicly opposed some of the Great Leap programs, quietly made themselves unavailable, and even appeared to take a passive attitude towards the Maoist economy. As the leaders worked collaboratively among themselves, they also worked with the local population as well. By being able to create an environment in which the Great Leap Forward did not become fully implemented, the Jiangxi government \"did their best to minimize damage\u2026\" These findings concluded that much of the severity of the famine came down to provincial leaders and their responsibility for their regions.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|pages=216\u2013218|chapter=Under the Same Maoist Sky : Accounting for Death Rate Discrepancies in Anhui and Jiangxi}}</ref>\n\n=== Natural disasters ===\nIn July 1959, the [[Yellow River]] flooded in [[East China]].

But the numbers were faked, and so were the fields that Mao observed, which had been carefully prepared in advance of Mao's visit by local officials, who removed shoots of grain from various fields and carefully transplanted them into a field prepared especially for Mao, which appeared to be a bumper crop.<ref name=\"becker\" />{{rp|122}}\n\nThe local officials became trapped by these sham demonstrations to Mao, and exhorted the peasants to reach unattainable goals, by \"deep ploughing and close planting\", and other techniques. This ended up making things much worse, the crop failed completely, leaving barren fields. No one was in a position to challenge Mao's ideas as incorrect, so peasants pulled out their bedding and coats into the fields, added seeds and water, and after they sprouted, buried the materials under the soil once the seedlings were high enough.<ref name=\"becker\" />{{rp|122}}\n\nIn a similar manner to the massive Soviet-created famine in Ukraine (the [[Holodomor]]), doctors were prohibited from listing \"starvation\" as a cause of death on death certificates. This kind of deception was far from uncommon; a famous [[propaganda]] picture from the famine shows Chinese children from [[Shandong]] province ostensibly standing atop a field of wheat, so densely grown that it could apparently support their weight.

The 46th [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|Disney animated feature film]], it was directed by [[Mark Dindal]] from a screenplay by [[Steve Bencich]], [[Ron J. Friedman]], and Ron Anderson, based on a story by Mark Kennedy and Dindal. The film is dedicated to Disney artist and writer [[Joe Grant]], who died before the film's release.\n\n''Chicken Little'' was animated in-house at Walt Disney Feature Animation's main headquarters in [[Burbank, California]] and released by [[Walt Disney Pictures]] on November 4, 2005, in [[Disney Digital 3-D]] (the first film to be released in this format) along with the standard 2D version. It is Disney's first fully computer-animated feature film, as [[Pixar]]'s films were distributed, but not produced by Disney, and ''[[Dinosaur (film)|Dinosaur]]'' (2000) was a combination of live-action and computer animation (which in turn was provided by division [[List of animation studios owned by The Walt Disney Company#The Secret Lab|The Secret Lab]]).\n\n''Chicken Little'' was Disney's second adaptation of the fable after a [[Chicken Little (1943 film)|propaganda cartoon]] made during [[World War II]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Willman|first1=Chris|title=Chicken Little|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2006/03/17/chicken-little|accessdate=July 9, 2015|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=March 17, 2006|quote=This Chicken Little feature wasn\u2019t Disney\u2019s first stab at animating the enduring fable of animal alarmism.

It grossed $314 million worldwide, making it Dindal's highest-grossing film to date, and the second highest grossing animated film of 2005 (behind ''[[Madagascar (2005 film)|Madagascar]]'').\n\n==Plot==\nIn the small town of Oakey Oaks, Chicken Little rings the school bell and warns everyone to run for their lives. This sends the whole town into a frenzied panic. Eventually, the Head of the Fire Department calms down enough to ask him what's going on, and he explains that the Sky is falling because a piece of the sky shaped like a stop sign had fallen on his head when he was sitting under the big oak tree in the town square; however, he is unable to find the piece. His father, Buck Cluck, who was once a high school baseball star, assumes that this \"piece of sky\" was just an acorn that had fallen off the tree and had hit him on the head, making Chicken Little the laughingstock of the town. \n\nA year later, Chicken Little has become infamous in the town for being prone to accidentally ruin everything. His only friends are outcasts like himself: Abby Mallard (nicknamed \"Ugly Duckling\"), Runt (who is a extremely large pig), and Fish Out of Water (who wears a helmet full of tap water). Trying to help, Abby encourages Chicken Little to talk to his father, but he really only wants to make his dad proud of him. He joins his school's baseball team in an attempt to recover his reputation and his father's pride, but is made last until the ninth inning of the last game. Chicken Little is reluctantly called to bat by the coach (even though the coach is certain that he will lose the game for them and urges him to not swing). Chicken Little is able to hit the ball and make it past first, second, and third bases, but is met at home plate by the outfielders. He tries sliding onto home plate but is touched by the ball. While it's presumed he lost the game, the umpire brushes away the dust to reveal Chicken Little's foot barely touching home plate, thus declaring Chicken Little safe and the game won; Chicken Little is hailed as a hero for winning the pennant.\n\nLater that night back at home, he is hit on the head yet again by the same \"piece of the sky\" \u2014 only to find out that it is not a piece of the sky, but a device which blends into the background (which would thereby explain why Chicken Little was unable to find it last time). He calls his friends over to help figure out what it is.\n\nWhen Fish pushes a button on the back of the hexagon, it flies into the sky, taking Fish with it. It turns out to be part of the camouflage of an invisible UFO. Chicken Little manages to ring the bell to warn everyone, but the aliens (who can't handle the sound of the bell) escape, leaving an orange alien child behind. No one believes the story of the alien invasion, and Chicken Little is ridiculed yet again... until the next day. He and his friends discover the orange alien named Kirby, and a few minutes later a whole fleet of alien ships descend on the town and start what appears to be an invasion. The invasion is actually a misunderstanding, as the two aliens are looking for their lost child and attack only out of concern. As the aliens rampage throughout Oakey Oaks, vaporizing everything in their path, Chicken Little realizes he must return Kirby to his parents to save the planet. First, though, he must confront his father and regain his trust.\n\nIn the invasion, Buck, now regaining his pride and trust in his son, defends him from the aliens until they get vaporized. It is then discovered that the aliens weren't vaporizing people, but teleported aboard the UFO. After everything is explained, the apologetic aliens return everything to normal (except Foxy Loxy, the school's bully whose brain got scrambled, turning her into a Southern Belle), and everyone is grateful for Chicken Little's efforts to save the town.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Zach Braff]] as Chicken Little, a young and diminutive rooster who suffers under the reputation for being crazy since he caused a panic saying the sky was falling.\n* [[Joan Cusack]] as Abigail \"Abby\" Mallard (also known as the Ugly Duckling), a female duck (implied swan) with buckteeth. She takes a generally optimistic approach to life. Unfortunately, she is often teased by Foxy for her appearance. She is Chicken Little's best friend, and by the end, his girlfriend.\n* Dan Molina as Fish Out of Water, a goldfish with a scuba helmet filled with water who lives on the surface. He makes gurgling sounds, cannot speak properly and acting out what he feels. He is not very shy around others and he will perform brave stunts without fear.\n* [[Steve Zahn]] as Runt of the Litter, a large pig with a huge heart who is much larger than the other children, but is far smaller than the other massive members of his family. Runt is easily frightened, anxious, and prone to panic.\n* [[Garry Marshall]] as Buck \"Ace\" Cluck, Chicken Little's widowed father and a former high school baseball star.\n* [[Amy Sedaris]] as Foxy Loxy, a mean, young fox who is a baseball star and the \"hometown hero\".

The 46th [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|Disney animated feature film]], it was directed by [[Mark Dindal]] from a screenplay by [[Steve Bencich]], [[Ron J. Friedman]], and Ron Anderson, based on a story by Mark Kennedy and Dindal. The film is dedicated to Disney artist and writer [[Joe Grant]], who died before the film's release.\n\n''Chicken Little'' was animated in-house at Walt Disney Feature Animation's main headquarters in [[Burbank, California]] and released by [[Walt Disney Pictures]] on November 4, 2005, in [[Disney Digital 3-D]] (the first film to be released in this format) along with the standard 2D version. It is Disney's first fully computer-animated feature film, as [[Pixar]]'s films were distributed, but not produced by Disney, and ''[[Dinosaur (film)|Dinosaur]]'' (2000) was a combination of live-action and computer animation (which in turn was provided by division [[List of animation studios owned by The Walt Disney Company#The Secret Lab|The Secret Lab]]).\n\n''Chicken Little'' was Disney's second adaptation of the fable after a [[Chicken Little (1943 film)|propaganda cartoon]] made during [[World War II]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Willman|first1=Chris|title=Chicken Little|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2006/03/17/chicken-little|accessdate=July 9, 2015|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=March 17, 2006|quote=This Chicken Little feature wasn\u2019t Disney\u2019s first stab at animating the enduring fable of animal alarmism.

It grossed $314 million worldwide, making it Dindal's highest-grossing film to date, and the second highest grossing animated film of 2005 (behind ''[[Madagascar (2005 film)|Madagascar]]'').\n\n==Plot==\nIn the small town of Oakey Oaks, Chicken Little rings the school bell and warns everyone to run for their lives. This sends the whole town into a frenzied panic. Eventually, the Head of the Fire Department calms down enough to ask him what's going on, and he explains that the Sky is falling because a piece of the sky shaped like a stop sign had fallen on his head when he was sitting under the big oak tree in the town square; however, he is unable to find the piece. His father, Buck Cluck, who was once a high school baseball star, assumes that this \"piece of sky\" was just an acorn that had fallen off the tree and had hit him on the head, making Chicken Little the laughingstock of the town. \n\nA year later, Chicken Little has become infamous in the town for being prone to accidentally ruin everything. His only friends are outcasts like himself: Abby Mallard (nicknamed \"Ugly Duckling\"), Runt (who is a extremely large pig), and Fish Out of Water (who wears a helmet full of tap water). Trying to help, Abby encourages Chicken Little to talk to his father, but he really only wants to make his dad proud of him. He joins his school's baseball team in an attempt to recover his reputation and his father's pride, but is made last until the ninth inning of the last game. Chicken Little is reluctantly called to bat by the coach (even though the coach is certain that he will lose the game for them and urges him to not swing). Chicken Little is able to hit the ball and make it past first, second, and third bases, but is met at home plate by the outfielders. He tries sliding onto home plate but is touched by the ball. While it's presumed he lost the game, the umpire brushes away the dust to reveal Chicken Little's foot barely touching home plate, thus declaring Chicken Little safe and the game won; Chicken Little is hailed as a hero for winning the pennant.\n\nLater that night back at home, he is hit on the head yet again by the same \"piece of the sky\" \u2014 only to find out that it is not a piece of the sky, but a device which blends into the background (which would thereby explain why Chicken Little was unable to find it last time). He calls his friends over to help figure out what it is.\n\nWhen Fish pushes a button on the back of the hexagon, it flies into the sky, taking Fish with it. It turns out to be part of the camouflage of an invisible UFO. Chicken Little manages to ring the bell to warn everyone, but the aliens (who can't handle the sound of the bell) escape, leaving an orange alien child behind. No one believes the story of the alien invasion, and Chicken Little is ridiculed yet again... until the next day. He and his friends discover the orange alien named Kirby, and a few minutes later a whole fleet of alien ships descend on the town and start what appears to be an invasion. The invasion is actually a misunderstanding, as the two aliens are looking for their lost child and attack only out of concern. As the aliens rampage throughout Oakey Oaks, vaporizing everything in their path, Chicken Little realizes he must return Kirby to his parents to save the planet. First, though, he must confront his father and regain his trust.\n\nIn the invasion, Buck, now regaining his pride and trust in his son, defends him from the aliens until they get vaporized. It is then discovered that the aliens weren't vaporizing people, but teleported aboard the UFO. After everything is explained, the apologetic aliens return everything to normal (except Foxy Loxy, the school's bully whose brain got scrambled, turning her into a Southern Belle), and everyone is grateful for Chicken Little's efforts to save the town.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Zach Braff]] as Chicken Little, a young and diminutive rooster who suffers under the reputation for being crazy since he caused a panic saying the sky was falling.\n* [[Joan Cusack]] as Abigail \"Abby\" Mallard (also known as the Ugly Duckling), a female duck (implied swan) with buckteeth. She takes a generally optimistic approach to life. Unfortunately, she is often teased by Foxy for her appearance. She is Chicken Little's best friend, and by the end, his girlfriend.\n* Dan Molina as Fish Out of Water, a goldfish with a scuba helmet filled with water who lives on the surface. He makes gurgling sounds, cannot speak properly and acting out what he feels. He is not very shy around others and he will perform brave stunts without fear.\n* [[Steve Zahn]] as Runt of the Litter, a large pig with a huge heart who is much larger than the other children, but is far smaller than the other massive members of his family.

He was ranked as the #2 recruit in the nation behind only [[Kobe Bryant]] whom almost joined him at Villanova after the two both played in the 1996 High School McDonald's All-American game and the All-Star [[Roundball Classic|Magic Johnson Roundball Classic]] game which they dominated together.\n\n==NCAA career==\nThomas made his mark in his one season in college at Villanova University. Joining a future NBA talent-laden team with [[Alvin Williams#Basketball career|Alvin Williams]], Jason Lawson, John Celestand and Malik Allen, he filled the void of former Big East Player of the Year [[Kerry Kittles#Career highlights|Kerry Kittles]] from the year before and helped lead the Wildcats to a BIG EAST Regular Season Championship under coach Steve Lappas.  Villanova would place 2nd in the Big East tournament but Thomas would be named to both ALL-BIG EAST and ALL-BIG EAST Tournament teams as well as win BIG EAST ROOKIE OF THE YEAR while sporting a 17PPG and 6Reb avg.  Villanova would make the NCAA Tourney but lose in round 2 to a U of California team that featured future NFL All-Pro, [[Tony Gonzalez]].\n\n==NBA career==\nFollowing his freshman year at [[Villanova Wildcats basketball|Villanova University]], he was drafted seventh overall by the [[New Jersey Nets]] in the [[1997 NBA draft]] and was immediately traded to the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] in exchange for the Sixers' draft pick ([[Keith Van Horn]]).\n\n===Philadelphia 76ers===\nThomas enjoyed a solid rookie season, averaging 11.0 points per game, and was named to the NBA's ALL-ROOKIE 2nd Team. The Sixers would grow impatient with a [[sophomore slump]] from Thomas, though, and in 1999 he and [[Scott Williams (basketball)|Scott Williams]] were traded to the [[Milwaukee Bucks]] for [[Jerald Honeycutt]] and [[Tyrone Hill]].\n\n===Milwaukee Bucks===\nMilwaukee was enamored with Thomas's raw talent and versatility, and hoped he could blossom into a star with more seasoning.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.si.com/vault/2002/10/28/8118866/6-milwaukee-bucks-with-glenn-robinson-gone-tim-thomas-has-a-chance-to-prove-that-hes-worth-his-big-contractand-that-he-can-fetch-more-wins-than-big-dog|title=6 Milwaukee Bucks With Glenn Robinson gone, Tim Thomas has a chance to prove that he's worth his big contract--and that he can fetch more wins than Big Dog|last=Burns|first=Marty|website=Vault|language=en|access-date=2019-03-14}}</ref> It looked like things were coming together for Thomas during the [[2000\u201301 NBA season|2000\u201301 season]], when he averaged a career-high 13.4 ppg for the Bucks.

with a soft shooting touch, Thomas was tabbed as a future NBA star when he was still in high school, and was selected to the [[McDonald's All-American]] team after averaging 25.3 points and 14.5 rebounds per game as a senior at [[Paterson Catholic High School]]. He was ranked as the #2 recruit in the nation behind only [[Kobe Bryant]] whom almost joined him at Villanova after the two both played in the 1996 High School McDonald's All-American game and the All-Star [[Roundball Classic|Magic Johnson Roundball Classic]] game which they dominated together.\n\n==NCAA career==\nThomas made his mark in his one season in college at Villanova University. Joining a future NBA talent-laden team with [[Alvin Williams#Basketball career|Alvin Williams]], Jason Lawson, John Celestand and Malik Allen, he filled the void of former Big East Player of the Year [[Kerry Kittles#Career highlights|Kerry Kittles]] from the year before and helped lead the Wildcats to a BIG EAST Regular Season Championship under coach Steve Lappas.  Villanova would place 2nd in the Big East tournament but Thomas would be named to both ALL-BIG EAST and ALL-BIG EAST Tournament teams as well as win BIG EAST ROOKIE OF THE YEAR while sporting a 17PPG and 6Reb avg.  Villanova would make the NCAA Tourney but lose in round 2 to a U of California team that featured future NFL All-Pro, [[Tony Gonzalez]].\n\n==NBA career==\nFollowing his freshman year at [[Villanova Wildcats basketball|Villanova University]], he was drafted seventh overall by the [[New Jersey Nets]] in the [[1997 NBA draft]] and was immediately traded to the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] in exchange for the Sixers' draft pick ([[Keith Van Horn]]).\n\n===Philadelphia 76ers===\nThomas enjoyed a solid rookie season, averaging 11.0 points per game, and was named to the NBA's ALL-ROOKIE 2nd Team. The Sixers would grow impatient with a [[sophomore slump]] from Thomas, though, and in 1999 he and [[Scott Williams (basketball)|Scott Williams]] were traded to the [[Milwaukee Bucks]] for [[Jerald Honeycutt]] and [[Tyrone Hill]].\n\n===Milwaukee Bucks===\nMilwaukee was enamored with Thomas's raw talent and versatility, and hoped he could blossom into a star with more seasoning.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.si.com/vault/2002/10/28/8118866/6-milwaukee-bucks-with-glenn-robinson-gone-tim-thomas-has-a-chance-to-prove-that-hes-worth-his-big-contractand-that-he-can-fetch-more-wins-than-big-dog|title=6 Milwaukee Bucks With Glenn Robinson gone, Tim Thomas has a chance to prove that he's worth his big contract--and that he can fetch more wins than Big Dog|last=Burns|first=Marty|website=Vault|language=en|access-date=2019-03-14}}</ref> It looked like things were coming together for Thomas during the [[2000\u201301 NBA season|2000\u201301 season]], when he averaged a career-high 13.4 ppg for the Bucks.
