The contributing base model was the [[Japanese domestic market|JDM]] Civic 3-door [[hatchback]] called the SiR (code named EK4). Like its sibling, the [[Honda Integra#DC2 Type R|Integra Type R DC2/JDM DB8]], the Civic SiR's transformation into a Type R was achieved by working on the base model and improving it to Honda's idea of a car capable of high performance on the circuit.\n\nThe first Civic to receive the Type R badge was introduced in August 1997, as the EK9. The EK9 shared many characteristics with the Integra Type R DC2/JDM DB8 such as omission of sound deadening and other weight reduction measures, a hand-ported [[Honda B engine#B16B (Type R)|B16B engine]], front helical limited-slip differential and a [[Close-ratio transmission]]. The B16B engine boasted one of the highest [[Power density|power output per litre]] of all time for a [[naturally aspirated engine]] with {{convert|185|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 8,200 rpm and {{convert|160|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 7,500 rpm of torque from {{convert|1595|cc|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} of displacement. For the first time, a strategically seam welded monocoque chassis was used to improve chassis rigidity. The interior featured red RECARO bucket seats, red door cards, red Type R floor mats, a titanium shift knob, and a [[Momo (company)|Momo]] leather-wrapped steering wheel. The EK9 was only available for sale in Japan.<ref name=\"Jalopnik\">{{cite web|URL=https://jalopnik.com/driving-this-jdm-honda-civic-type-r-was-as-perfect-as-i-1789197385|title=Driving This JDM Honda Civic Type R Was As Perfect As I Imagined|date=2016-11-26|first=Kurt|last=Bradley|publisher=[[Gizmodo Media Group|Jalopnik]]|access-date=2018-03-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/honda/93012/honda-civic-type-r-1997-2000|title=Honda Civic Type R 1997-2000|website=www.autoexpress.co.uk|accessdate=2019-11-19}}</ref>\n\nPerformance figures include a {{cvt|0-60|mph|kph|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} acceleration time of 6.7 seconds and a quarter-mile time of 15.3 seconds.

This European Domestic Market Civic Type R featured a {{convert|200|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} 2.0-litre i-VTEC engine (K20A2) and the regular Type R treatment of seam welding, close ratio 6-speed transmission and upgraded brakes, but did not include some of the other higher-end features, such as the helical LSD and red [[Recaro]] race-seats, that were standard on the EK9.\n\n[[File:Honda Civic Type R 001.JPG|thumb|Civic Type R (EP3) (JDM)]]\nHowever, Honda marketed a JDM ([[Japanese domestic market]]) version of the EP3 (which was exclusively manufactured in Swindon, UK and was shipped to Japan), which retained the highly renowned helical LSD similar to that of the EK9 and red [[Recaro]] race-seats. Other differences of the JDM model included a more track-oriented chassis/undercarriage settings as compared to the European model as well as a more powerful engine having a power output of {{convert|215|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} (designated K20A) had a fully balanced crankshaft assembly with different intake manifold, exhaust manifold, higher-lift camshafts, higher-compression pistons, chrome-moly flywheel and ECU programming. All of the Japan-spec K20A Type R powertrains were built in Japan and shipped to the Swindon plant to be installed in the Japan-spec Type-R EP3. The JDM EP3 was also available in the traditional Type R championship white while the EDM was not. The EDM has more relaxed gear ratios and some high rpm torque traded for low rpm torque compared to the JDM.<ref name=\"Evo\">{{cite web|URL=https://www.evo.co.uk/honda/civic-type-r/15457/should-you-buy-a-honda-civic-type-r-ep3|title=Should you buy a Honda Civic Type-R (EP3)?|date=2015-03-10|first=Anthony|last=Ingram|publisher=[[Evo (magazine)|Evo]]|accessdate=2019-03-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|URL=https://www.pistonheads.com/gassing/topic.asp?h=0&f=47&t=1518874|title=Civic Type R EP3 JDM|date=2015-06-15|publisher=Piston Heads|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, the EP3 was updated with many improvements \u2013 revised EPS with quicker steering, revised suspension settings, projector headlamps (JDM came equipped with halogens only while the EDM came with an option for HIDs with self-leveling motors), lighter clutch and flywheel assembly etc. Based on Honda literature, this facelifted (FL) model was targeted at addressing customers' and critics' feedback such as understeer on the limit (due to the front [[MacPherson strut]] setup), numb steering response and lack of low end torque.<ref>{{cite web|URL=https://www.evo.co.uk/honda/civic-type-r/14073/honda-civic-type-r-ep3-buying-checkpoints|title=Honda Civic Type R EP3 Buying Checkpoints|date=2013-03-14|work=[[Evo (magazine)|Evo]]|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref>\n\n'''Performance''' (all figures are manufacturer claims)\n\n*0\u2013{{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} in 5.8/6.5 seconds (JDM/EDM Pre-facelift), 5.8/6.4 seconds (JDM/EDM Facelift)\n* 0\u2013{{convert|100|mi/h|km/h|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} in 15.1/16 secs (JDM/EDM Facelift)\n*Top speed {{convert|141|mi/h|km/h|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} and {{convert|146|mi/h|km/h|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} (JDM/EDM)\n\n'''Note:''' JDM (Japanese Domestic Model), EDM (European Domestic Model).\n\n[[Mugen Motorsports]] developed an upgraded version of the JDM Civic Type R, with a sport exhaust system and engine tuning, special Mugen Grille, and anti-roll bars for pro racing activities.<ref>{{cite web|URL=https://www.motortrend.com/news/honda-civic-type-r-built-at-uk-factory/|title=TYPE R APPROVED: THE THREE OTHER CIVIC TYPE R CARS THAT CAME FROM HONDA'S UK FACTORY|date=2018-02-20|publisher=MotorTrend|access-date=2019-05-31}}</ref>\n\n===30th Anniversary Edition===\nIn 2003 Honda celebrated 30 years of the Civic badge by offering a special edition 30th Anniversary Civic Type R.

For the first time, the JDM Civic Type R was sold as a four-door saloon rather than a three-door [[hatchback]]. The FD2 Type R was bigger, wider and heavier than the EP3 Type R. The wheelbase grew from {{convert|2570|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} to {{convert|2700|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, giving the FD2 more stability during high speed cornering. The Japanese model's engine power output is higher than the European versions, with {{convert|225|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} being generated at 8,000&nbsp;rpm and {{convert|215|Nm|lbft||abbr=on}} of torque peaking at 6,100&nbsp;rpm (versus {{convert|201|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} at 7,800&nbsp;rpm and {{convert|193|Nm|lbft|abbr=on}} at 5,600&nbsp;rpm for the European model). Honda quoted that mid-range is increased by {{convert|10|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}. Power is sent to the front wheels through a close-ratio six-speed manual gearbox, and a helical limited slip differential is fitted as standard. The front brake discs are {{convert|320|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} diameter and fitted with four piston [[Brembo]] calipers. The car is fitted with [[Bridgestone]] Potenza RE070 tyres having size of 225/40 R18.\n\nHonda claims the chassis is 50% more rigid than the previous Japan-only prefacelift [[Honda Integra DC5|DC5 Integra Type R]] and 25% more rigid than the previous Japan-only facelift [[Honda Integra DC5|DC5 Integra Type R]]. The FD2 features an independent rear suspension rather than the torsion beam configuration used on the FN2 Type-R.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pistonheads.com/news/default.asp?storyId=16084 |title=PistonHeads Headlines |publisher=Pistonheads.com |date=29 March 2007 |accessdate=2 November 2010}}</ref> To save weight, aluminium is used extensively and bonded with adhesive instead of welded.

The rear bumper features a diffuser built into the bumper and huge rear wing completes the aero package. Inside, the trademark black and red bucket seats are no longer made by [[Recaro]] as with previous versions, but designed in-house by Honda. Also gone is the [[Momo (company)|Momo]] made steering wheel, instead replaced by a Honda made version. The familiar red-on-black colour scheme or black-on-black scheme is offered on Championship White and Super Platinum Metallic Silver while a black-on-black scheme with red stitching is for the Vivid Blue Pearl only.\n\nIn October 2008, the Type R received new colours, those being Premium White Pearl, Premium Deep Violet Pearl and Crystal Black Pearl. The Vivid Blue Pearl colour was dropped.\n\nIn back to back tests, the Civic Type R (FD2) was on average 1 second quicker than the Integra Type-R (DC5) at the [[Tsukuba Circuit]] and four seconds faster at the longer [[Suzuka Circuit]].<ref name=Evo0709>{{cite web|url=http://www.evo.co.uk/carreviews/evocarreviews/209845/honda_civic.html |title=Meaden, Richard (September 2007), \"Honda Civic Type R\", evo: |publisher=Evo.co.uk |date=6 September 2007 |accessdate=2 November 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn a back to back test on the United Kingdom TV program [[Fifth Gear]], the FD2 Type-R was three seconds quicker than the equivalent FN2 UK version around Castle Combe Circuit in wet conditions.

The FK8 has a top speed of {{cvt|169|mph|kph|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} making it the fastest Civic Type R model to date.<ref name=\"WC\"/>\n\nIn back to back testing involving a FK8 and FK2 Type R, the reviewers praised the FK8's comfortable ride and feedback and criticised the FK2's harsh ride on the road and worse handling when the R+ driving mode was activated. The reviewers also complained about the FK2's interior being dated but stated that this was due to the model's late arrival at the end of the base model's production run.<ref>{{cite web|URL=https://www.carthrottle.com/post/fk2-vs-fk8-honda-civic-type-r-how-much-has-the-game-moved-on/|title=FK2 Vs FK8 Honda Civic Type R: How Much Has The Game Moved On?|date=2019-03-03|first=Matt|last=Robinson|publisher=[[Car Throttle]]|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref>\n\n=== Interior and safety features ===\n[[File:Honda CIVIC TYPE R (DBA-FK8) interior.jpg|thumb|Interior]]\nThe interior of the Type R is based on the base model Civic and has a low driving position with the gear shift lever positioned high in order to allow for easy gear changes. The interior has red and black colour as standard with sports seats along with carbon fibre trim. The driver's seat and the steering wheel are adjustable. A reversing camera is standard for easier rear visibility while reversing while parking sensors are standard in the GT Trim. The interior although lauded for its comfortability and user friendliness is criticised for its infotainment system which has been described as slow and difficult to operate. The fit and finish is considered to be in particular with its competitors. Safety features include automatic emergency braking, traffic sign recognition, lane departure warning and automatic high beam assistance which are carried over from the base Civic. The GT trim adds blindspot monitoring and cross traffic alert, parking sensors at the front and rear, dual-zone climate control, power-folding door mirrors and infotainment upgrades that include wireless phone charging and in-built sat-navigation along with a more powerful 11-speaker stereo. The Type R earned a Euro NCAP 5 star crash test rating.<ref name=\"WC\">{{cite web|URL=https://www.whatcar.com/honda/civic/hatchback/review/|title=Honda Civic Type R review|date=|work=What Car?|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref>\n\n=== Records ===\nOn 3 April 2017, the pre-production Type R achieved a lap time of 7:43.80 on the [[N\u00fcrburgring Nordschleife]], almost 7 seconds faster than its predecessor, setting a new record for front-wheel drive cars.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.topgear.com/car-news/hot-hatch/honda-civic-type-r-has-new-nurburgring-record|title=The Honda Civic Type R has a new N\u00fcrburgring record|last=Dobie|first=Stephen|date=24 April 2017|website=Top Gear|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Markets ===\n==== United States ====\nThe Civic Type R went on sale in the United States on 14 June 2017, marking the first time the Civic Type R was officially sold in the U.S market.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/04/first-ever-us-honda-civic-type-r-finally-arrives-with-306-horsepower/ |title=First-ever US Honda Civic Type R finally arrives with 306 horsepower |publisher=Arstechica |date=21 April 2017 |accessdate=22 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://hondanews.com/releases/first-ever-civic-type-r-for-america-goes-on-sale-tomorrow |title=First-Ever Civic Type R for America Goes On Sale Tomorrow |publisher=Honda News |date=7 April 2017 |accessdate=16 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n==== United Kingdom ====\nIn the UK, the Civic Type R were available for consumer test drives in August 2017, with official delivery and sale dates coinciding with national vehicle registration plate changes on 1 September.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/818227/Civic-Type-R-car-review-hot-hatchback-Volkswagon-Golf-GTI|title=Civic Type R: Honda takes on the Audi RS3 and Ford Focus as the new hot hatch|first=Nat|last=Barnes|date=17 June 2017|website=Express.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n==== Australia ====\nThe FK8 Civic Type R went on sale in Australia in September 2017.

The contributing base model was the [[Japanese domestic market|JDM]] Civic 3-door [[hatchback]] called the SiR (code named EK4). Like its sibling, the [[Honda Integra#DC2 Type R|Integra Type R DC2/JDM DB8]], the Civic SiR's transformation into a Type R was achieved by working on the base model and improving it to Honda's idea of a car capable of high performance on the circuit.\n\nThe first Civic to receive the Type R badge was introduced in August 1997, as the EK9. The EK9 shared many characteristics with the Integra Type R DC2/JDM DB8 such as omission of sound deadening and other weight reduction measures, a hand-ported [[Honda B engine#B16B (Type R)|B16B engine]], front helical limited-slip differential and a [[Close-ratio transmission]]. The B16B engine boasted one of the highest [[Power density|power output per litre]] of all time for a [[naturally aspirated engine]] with {{convert|185|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 8,200 rpm and {{convert|160|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 7,500 rpm of torque from {{convert|1595|cc|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} of displacement. For the first time, a strategically seam welded monocoque chassis was used to improve chassis rigidity. The interior featured red RECARO bucket seats, red door cards, red Type R floor mats, a titanium shift knob, and a [[Momo (company)|Momo]] leather-wrapped steering wheel.

The engine is mated to a close ratio 6-speed manual transmission continuing the tradition of its predecessors with limited slip differential as standard. The aerodynamic elements increase downforce even further as compared to the outgoing model. The FK8 has a top speed of {{cvt|169|mph|kph|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} making it the fastest Civic Type R model to date.<ref name=\"WC\"/>\n\nIn back to back testing involving a FK8 and FK2 Type R, the reviewers praised the FK8's comfortable ride and feedback and criticised the FK2's harsh ride on the road and worse handling when the R+ driving mode was activated. The reviewers also complained about the FK2's interior being dated but stated that this was due to the model's late arrival at the end of the base model's production run.<ref>{{cite web|URL=https://www.carthrottle.com/post/fk2-vs-fk8-honda-civic-type-r-how-much-has-the-game-moved-on/|title=FK2 Vs FK8 Honda Civic Type R: How Much Has The Game Moved On?|date=2019-03-03|first=Matt|last=Robinson|publisher=[[Car Throttle]]|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref>\n\n=== Interior and safety features ===\n[[File:Honda CIVIC TYPE R (DBA-FK8) interior.jpg|thumb|Interior]]\nThe interior of the Type R is based on the base model Civic and has a low driving position with the gear shift lever positioned high in order to allow for easy gear changes. The interior has red and black colour as standard with sports seats along with carbon fibre trim. The driver's seat and the steering wheel are adjustable. A reversing camera is standard for easier rear visibility while reversing while parking sensors are standard in the GT Trim. The interior although lauded for its comfortability and user friendliness is criticised for its infotainment system which has been described as slow and difficult to operate. The fit and finish is considered to be in particular with its competitors. Safety features include automatic emergency braking, traffic sign recognition, lane departure warning and automatic high beam assistance which are carried over from the base Civic. The GT trim adds blindspot monitoring and cross traffic alert, parking sensors at the front and rear, dual-zone climate control, power-folding door mirrors and infotainment upgrades that include wireless phone charging and in-built sat-navigation along with a more powerful 11-speaker stereo. The Type R earned a Euro NCAP 5 star crash test rating.<ref name=\"WC\">{{cite web|URL=https://www.whatcar.com/honda/civic/hatchback/review/|title=Honda Civic Type R review|date=|work=What Car?|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref>\n\n=== Records ===\nOn 3 April 2017, the pre-production Type R achieved a lap time of 7:43.80 on the [[N\u00fcrburgring Nordschleife]], almost 7 seconds faster than its predecessor, setting a new record for front-wheel drive cars.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.topgear.com/car-news/hot-hatch/honda-civic-type-r-has-new-nurburgring-record|title=The Honda Civic Type R has a new N\u00fcrburgring record|last=Dobie|first=Stephen|date=24 April 2017|website=Top Gear|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Markets ===\n==== United States ====\nThe Civic Type R went on sale in the United States on 14 June 2017, marking the first time the Civic Type R was officially sold in the U.S market.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/04/first-ever-us-honda-civic-type-r-finally-arrives-with-306-horsepower/ |title=First-ever US Honda Civic Type R finally arrives with 306 horsepower |publisher=Arstechica |date=21 April 2017 |accessdate=22 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://hondanews.com/releases/first-ever-civic-type-r-for-america-goes-on-sale-tomorrow |title=First-Ever Civic Type R for America Goes On Sale Tomorrow |publisher=Honda News |date=7 April 2017 |accessdate=16 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n==== United Kingdom ====\nIn the UK, the Civic Type R were available for consumer test drives in August 2017, with official delivery and sale dates coinciding with national vehicle registration plate changes on 1 September.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/818227/Civic-Type-R-car-review-hot-hatchback-Volkswagon-Golf-GTI|title=Civic Type R: Honda takes on the Audi RS3 and Ford Focus as the new hot hatch|first=Nat|last=Barnes|date=17 June 2017|website=Express.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n==== Australia ====\nThe FK8 Civic Type R went on sale in Australia in September 2017.
