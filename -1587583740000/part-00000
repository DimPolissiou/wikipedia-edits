[[Barry Bostwick]] and [[Patricia Richardson]] portray Jeffrey Wyatt, a struggling widowed father with identical triplet teenage daughters, and Cassie McGuire, his snobbish, jealous girlfriend. Leanna, Monica, and Joy Creel portray Lisa, Jessie, and Megan Wyatt.\n\n==Plot==\nJeffrey Wyatt is the widowed father of identical triplet teenage daughters, Lisa, Jessie, and Megan. As he picks his daughters up from the airport, he neglects to tell them over the summer he has become engaged to Cassie McGuire. Cassie wants to redesign their California beach house with the help of house designer Susan Evers. Jeffrey initially doesn't like Susan's ideas, but comes around to allowing them due to Cassie.\n\nLisa, who is dating David, has invited a boy she met in Paris named Hawk, a \"bad boy\" to eat at their house. She doesn't know how to break it to him that she finds Hawk \"more unpredictable\". She asks Jessie to pretend to be Lisa on a date with David, so Lisa can go on a date with Hawk while their father goes on a date with Cassie, Susan, and Nick (Ray Baker) his best friend. As the adults are getting ready for their double date, Susan compliments Jessie going out with David, almost exposing the ruse until Jeffrey innocently jokes he confuses the girls occasionally. At their date, Jessie is bewildered to be at a \"Welcome Home Lisa\" party with all of their friends. She embarrasses herself during a karaoke dance skit called \"The Jackson Three\" (a parody of the [[Jackson Five]]), singing the [[Janet Jackson]] song \"[[What Have You Done for Me Lately]]\". \n\nHawk is not wanting to settle down and be Lisa's boyfriend. He asks her to run away with him, but she refuses. Later that night, Jeffrey figures out the switch and grounds the girls for three weeks, with David disappointed in Lisa and Jessie. Lisa unleashes her feelings and tells Jeffrey that she doesn't like the jealous, snobbish Cassie, and neither do her sisters. The next morning, Susan speaks with Jessie and Megan, saying her earlier compliment was not an honest mistake, but that she suspected Lisa and Jessie were switching identities, and even shows them a picture of herself with her twin sister, Sharon Grand.\n\nLisa runs away with Hawk on his motorcycle only to break down at a diner. Jessie and Megan, using David's car, find her. Jeffrey, Susan, and David also do so. Hawk and David fight in the diner, causing the police to be called, and Hawk breaks up with Lisa. David begins to like Jessie better than Lisa. Cassie becomes angry that Susan went with Jeffrey to the diner. The girls begin to befriend and like Susan. They set up a date for her and Jeffrey by not telling Nick and Cassie to come. Jeffrey expresses his admiration for Susan, who refuses because he is engaged. She quits working on the Wyatts' house and continues with Nick's condo and Cassie moves the date to two days away. The girls go to Susan's apartment and meet Sharon Grand, Susan's twin sister. Sharon agrees to help them set up Jeffrey and Susan.\n\nOn the wedding day, Sharon and the girls lock Jeffrey and Susan in the garage shed, resulting in Jeffrey missing the wedding. Cassie, devastated, hooks up with Nick and drives away. David and Jessie become a couple.  Jeffrey and Susan realize their love for each other after playing the piano and singing to the music box she bought and then gave to him.  Sharon and the girls take down the shed wall, revealing Jeffrey and Susan about to kiss.\n\n===Continuity===\nIn ''[[The Parent Trap II]]'', Sharon Ferris married Bill Grand ([[Tom Skerritt]]), creating a family with their daughters, Nikki Ferris ([[Carrie Kei Heim]]) and Mary Grand ([[Bridgette Andersen]]).

[[Barry Bostwick]] and [[Patricia Richardson]] portray Jeffrey Wyatt, a struggling widowed father with identical triplet teenage daughters, and Cassie McGuire, his snobbish, jealous girlfriend. Leanna, Monica, and Joy Creel portray Lisa, Jessie, and Megan Wyatt.\n\n==Plot==\nJeffrey Wyatt is the widowed father of identical triplet teenage daughters, Lisa, Jessie, and Megan. As he picks his daughters up from the airport, he neglects to tell them over the summer he has become engaged to Cassie McGuire. Cassie wants to redesign their California beach house with the help of house designer Susan Evers. Jeffrey initially doesn't like Susan's ideas, but comes around to allowing them due to Cassie.\n\nLisa, who is dating David, has invited a boy she met in Paris named Hawk, a \"bad boy\" to eat at their house. She doesn't know how to break it to him that she finds Hawk \"more unpredictable\". She asks Jessie to pretend to be Lisa on a date with David, so Lisa can go on a date with Hawk while their father goes on a date with Cassie, Susan, and Nick (Ray Baker) his best friend. As the adults are getting ready for their double date, Susan compliments Jessie going out with David, almost exposing the ruse until Jeffrey innocently jokes he confuses the girls occasionally.

The electorate was first established for the 1978 election and was abolished again in 1984, and has existed again since the 2002 election. The MP for Helensville is [[Chris Penk]] of the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]], who has held the seat since the [[2017 New Zealand general election|2017 general election]].\n\n==Population centres==\nThe 1977 electoral redistribution was the most overtly political since the Representation Commission had been established through an amendment to the ''Representation Act'' in 1886, initiated by [[Robert Muldoon|Muldoon]]'s [[Third National Government of New Zealand|National Government]].{{sfn|McRobie |1989 |pp=8\u20139, 51, 119}} As part of the [[1976 New Zealand census|1976 census]], a large number of people failed to fill in an electoral re-registration card, and census staff had not been given the authority to insist on the card being completed. This had little practical effect for people on the general roll, but it transferred [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] to the general roll if the card was not handed in. Together with a northward shift of New Zealand's population, this resulted in five new electorates having to be created in the upper part of the [[North Island]].{{sfn|McRobie|1989|p=119}} The electoral redistribution was very disruptive, and 22 electorates were abolished, while 27 electorates were newly created (including Helensville) or re-established. These changes came into effect for the {{NZ election link|1978}}.{{sfn|McRobie|1989|pp=115\u2013120}}\n\nIn the 1983 electoral redistribution, the Helensville electorate was abolished, and its area went to {{NZ electorate link|West Auckland}} and {{NZ electorate link|Rodney}}.{{sfn|McRobie|1989|pp=118\u2013123}} The electorate was re-established in time for the [[2002 New Zealand general election|2002 election]] in reaction to continued high population growth in and around Auckland. It was made by cutting off the northern flank of the electorate of [[Waitakere (New Zealand electorate)|Waitakere]] and adding in areas from the electorate of [[Rodney (New Zealand electorate)|Rodney]] around its southern boundary.\n\nHelensville covered an area of the rapidly growing northern [[Auckland]] urban fringe, drawing [[Helensville]] and [[Kumeu]] from [[Rodney, New Zealand|Rodney District]], moving south to take in [[Paremoremo]], [[Greenhithe, New Zealand|Greenhithe]] and [[Albany, New Zealand|Albany]] from [[North Shore City]], and finally tacking west to include [[Whenuapai]], [[Hobsonville]] and [[West Harbour, Auckland|West Harbour]] from [[Waitakere City]].\n\nThe electorate was abolished as part of the 2019/20 boundary review, with the southern section around the [[Waitakere Ranges]] being merged into {{NZ electorate link|New Lynn}}, an area around [[Coatesville, New Zealand|Coatesville]] was shed to {{NZ electorate link|Whangapar\u0101oa}}, and the rest of the seat was merged into the new electorate of [[Kaipara ki Mahurangi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://vote.nz/assets/Boundary-Review/REPORT-OF-THE-REPRESENTATION-COMMISSION-2020.pdf |title=Report of the Representation Commission 2020 |date=17 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:John Key electorate office.jpg|thumb|John Key's electorate office]]\nIn the 1978 election, the Helensville electorate was won by [[Dail Jones]], who had been MP for the {{NZ electorate link|Waitemata}} electorate since the {{NZ election link|1975}}.{{sfn|Wilson|1985|p=208}} After the Helensville electorate was abolished, Jones stood in the West Auckland electorate in the {{NZ election link|1984}} but was defeated by the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] candidate, [[Jack Elder]].{{sfn|Wilson|1985|pp=194, 208}}\n\nSince the Helensville electorate was re-established for the {{NZ election link|2002}}, its only MP was the former Prime Minister, [[John Key]], who beat sitting Waitakere MP [[Brian Neeson]] to the nomination, and in a tight year for his party, won the electorate by 1,705 votes in a split field when a disgruntled Neeson chose to stand as an independent. Helensville is partly rural, and wealthy beyond the national average, making it a safe National electorate, and Key was returned easily in [[2005 New Zealand general election|2005]], [[2008 New Zealand general election|2008]] and [[2011 New Zealand general election|2011]] with large majorities.\n\nIn December 2016, Key announced that he was stepping down as prime minister and would retire from politics before the [[2017 New Zealand general election|2017 general election]], citing pressure on his family.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11760656|accessdate=27 September 2017|title=John Key resigns as Prime Minister of New Zealand, cites family reasons for leaving|date=5 December 2016|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]}}</ref> The Helensville seat was won in the election by [[Chris Penk]], retaining it for the National Party.\n\n===Members of Parliament===\n'''Key'''\n\n{{Party index link|New Zealand National Party}} {{Party index link|New Zealand First}} {{Party index link|New Zealand Labour Party}} {{Party index link|ACT New Zealand}} {{Party index link|Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand}}\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!width=100| Election\n!width=175 colspan=2| Winner\n|-\n|{{NZ election link|1978}}\n|rowspan=2 width=5 bgcolor={{New Zealand National Party/meta/color}}|\n|rowspan=2| [[Dail Jones]]\n|-\n|{{NZ election link|1981}}\n|-\n|colspan=3 align=center|<small>Electorate abolished in 1984 (see {{NZ electorate link|West Auckland}} and {{NZ electorate link|Rodney}})</small>\n|-\n|{{NZ election link|2002}}\n|rowspan=5 {{Meta color|New Zealand National Party}}\n|rowspan=5|[[John Key]]\n|-\n|{{NZ election link|2005}}\n|-\n|{{NZ election link|2008}}\n|-\n|{{NZ election link|2011}}\n|-\n|{{NZ election link|2014}}\n|-\n|{{NZ election link|2017}}\n|{{Meta color|New Zealand National Party}}\n|[[Chris Penk]]\n|}\n\n===List MPs===\nMembers of Parliament elected from party lists in elections where that person also unsuccessfully contested the Helensville electorate.

The electorate was first established for the 1978 election and was abolished again in 1984, and has existed again since the 2002 election. The MP for Helensville is [[Chris Penk]] of the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]], who has held the seat since the [[2017 New Zealand general election|2017 general election]].\n\n==Population centres==\nThe 1977 electoral redistribution was the most overtly political since the Representation Commission had been established through an amendment to the ''Representation Act'' in 1886, initiated by [[Robert Muldoon|Muldoon]]'s [[Third National Government of New Zealand|National Government]].{{sfn|McRobie |1989 |pp=8\u20139, 51, 119}} As part of the [[1976 New Zealand census|1976 census]], a large number of people failed to fill in an electoral re-registration card, and census staff had not been given the authority to insist on the card being completed. This had little practical effect for people on the general roll, but it transferred [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] to the general roll if the card was not handed in. Together with a northward shift of New Zealand's population, this resulted in five new electorates having to be created in the upper part of the [[North Island]].{{sfn|McRobie|1989|p=119}} The electoral redistribution was very disruptive, and 22 electorates were abolished, while 27 electorates were newly created (including Helensville) or re-established. These changes came into effect for the {{NZ election link|1978}}.{{sfn|McRobie|1989|pp=115\u2013120}}\n\nIn the 1983 electoral redistribution, the Helensville electorate was abolished, and its area went to {{NZ electorate link|West Auckland}} and {{NZ electorate link|Rodney}}.{{sfn|McRobie|1989|pp=118\u2013123}} The electorate was re-established in time for the [[2002 New Zealand general election|2002 election]] in reaction to continued high population growth in and around Auckland. It was made by cutting off the northern flank of the electorate of [[Waitakere (New Zealand electorate)|Waitakere]] and adding in areas from the electorate of [[Rodney (New Zealand electorate)|Rodney]] around its southern boundary.\n\nHelensville covered an area of the rapidly growing northern [[Auckland]] urban fringe, drawing [[Helensville]] and [[Kumeu]] from [[Rodney, New Zealand|Rodney District]], moving south to take in [[Paremoremo]], [[Greenhithe, New Zealand|Greenhithe]] and [[Albany, New Zealand|Albany]] from [[North Shore City]], and finally tacking west to include [[Whenuapai]], [[Hobsonville]] and [[West Harbour, Auckland|West Harbour]] from [[Waitakere City]].\n\nThe electorate was abolished as part of the 2019/20 boundary review, with the southern section around the [[Waitakere Ranges]] being merged into {{NZ electorate link|New Lynn}}, an area around [[Coatesville]] was shed to {{NZ electorate link|Whangapar\u0101oa}}, and the rest of the seat was merged into the new electorate of [[Kaipara ki Mahurangi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://vote.nz/assets/Boundary-Review/REPORT-OF-THE-REPRESENTATION-COMMISSION-2020.pdf |title=Report of the Representation Commission 2020 |date=17 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:John Key electorate office.jpg|thumb|John Key's electorate office]]\nIn the 1978 election, the Helensville electorate was won by [[Dail Jones]], who had been MP for the {{NZ electorate link|Waitemata}} electorate since the {{NZ election link|1975}}.{{sfn|Wilson|1985|p=208}} After the Helensville electorate was abolished, Jones stood in the West Auckland electorate in the {{NZ election link|1984}} but was defeated by the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] candidate, [[Jack Elder]].{{sfn|Wilson|1985|pp=194, 208}}\n\nSince the Helensville electorate was re-established for the {{NZ election link|2002}}, its only MP was the former Prime Minister, [[John Key]], who beat sitting Waitakere MP [[Brian Neeson]] to the nomination, and in a tight year for his party, won the electorate by 1,705 votes in a split field when a disgruntled Neeson chose to stand as an independent. Helensville is partly rural, and wealthy beyond the national average, making it a safe National electorate, and Key was returned easily in [[2005 New Zealand general election|2005]], [[2008 New Zealand general election|2008]] and [[2011 New Zealand general election|2011]] with large majorities.\n\nIn December 2016, Key announced that he was stepping down as prime minister and would retire from politics before the [[2017 New Zealand general election|2017 general election]], citing pressure on his family.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11760656|accessdate=27 September 2017|title=John Key resigns as Prime Minister of New Zealand, cites family reasons for leaving|date=5 December 2016|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]}}</ref> The Helensville seat was won in the election by [[Chris Penk]], retaining it for the National Party.\n\n===Members of Parliament===\n'''Key'''\n\n{{Party index link|New Zealand National Party}} {{Party index link|New Zealand First}} {{Party index link|New Zealand Labour Party}} {{Party index link|ACT New Zealand}} {{Party index link|Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand}}\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!width=100| Election\n!width=175 colspan=2| Winner\n|-\n|{{NZ election link|1978}}\n|rowspan=2 width=5 bgcolor={{New Zealand National Party/meta/color}}|\n|rowspan=2| [[Dail Jones]]\n|-\n|{{NZ election link|1981}}\n|-\n|colspan=3 align=center|<small>Electorate abolished in 1984 (see {{NZ electorate link|West Auckland}} and {{NZ electorate link|Rodney}})</small>\n|-\n|{{NZ election link|2002}}\n|rowspan=5 {{Meta color|New Zealand National Party}}\n|rowspan=5|[[John Key]]\n|-\n|{{NZ election link|2005}}\n|-\n|{{NZ election link|2008}}\n|-\n|{{NZ election link|2011}}\n|-\n|{{NZ election link|2014}}\n|-\n|{{NZ election link|2017}}\n|{{Meta color|New Zealand National Party}}\n|[[Chris Penk]]\n|}\n\n===List MPs===\nMembers of Parliament elected from party lists in elections where that person also unsuccessfully contested the Helensville electorate.

It is a form of [[recreation|recreational activity]] as well as a sport, and can also be a form of transportation. In fact, as the United States readied for [[World War II]], the government entertained the notion to add roller skates as essential equipment to move infantry around Europe to save gas. Skates generally come in three basic varieties: quad [[roller skates]], [[inline skates]] or blades and tri-skates, though some have experimented with a single-wheeled \"quintessence skate\" or other variations on the basic skate design. In America, this hobby was most popular first between 1935 and the early 1960s and then in the 1970s, when polyurethane wheels were created and [[Disco|disco music]] oriented roller rinks were the rage and then again in the 1990s when in-line outdoor roller skating, thanks to the improvement made to inline roller skates in 1981 by Scott Olson, took hold.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Roller skates, 1910.jpg|thumb|Young man on the Edvard Petrini's pedaled roller skates,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/patents?id=4ro-AAAAEBAJ|title=Patent US809980 - Roller-skate.}}</ref> known as ''Takypod'' in Sweden, circa 1910]]Roller skating has had a checkered past over its nearly-three century history. Given its ebb and flow of popularity over the past century, writers labeled each generation's attraction a \"craze!\"  The caption in a 1904 Decatur newspaper read, \"Old Craze Comes Back,\" adding, \"Roller skating promises to be as popular as it was twenty years ago.\" Reported on 11 October 1904, the statement announced the opening events of a new Decatur, Illinois roller rink.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Old Craze Comes Back|date=11 October 1904|work=Decatur Daily Review}}</ref> In 1906, with the opening of another Chicago rink, the ''Inter Ocean'' newspaper complained that \"after twenty years of exemption from the affliction the desire to roll is again taking possession of American adults...the mania has struck Chicago!\"<ref>{{Cite news|title=Shall We All Roll Again?|date=22 October 1906|work=Inter Ocean|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nNearly forty years later, Charlie Tyler would write, \"This current roller skating 'craze' is nothing new.\" Tyler wrote for Chicago's ''Herald-American'' in September 1941 and described the opening of Chicago's Madison Gardens Rink's thirty-fifth season on the eve of World War II.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Rollin Round Roller Rinks|last=Tyler|first=Charlie|date=25 September 1941|work=Chicago Herald-American|access-date=}}</ref> Tyler was referring to the first roller skate craze at the turn of the twentieth century,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/news/topics/rollerskating.html|title=Topics in Chronicling America - Roller Skating Craze, Newspapers and Current Periodical Reading Room|last=Library of Congress|date=2 May 2013|website=Library of Congress|access-date=2 December 2018}}</ref> when ball bearings revolutionized roller technology and roller skaters staged spectacle events and speed-skating marathons. Clamp-on skates were mass-produced for those with great aspirations. Tyler's reporting attempted to temper the rebirth of enthusiasm for the new roller styles that had become popular, including roller derby and dancing on rollers, suggesting that we had seen this before. Today, the acceptance for roller skating is not unlike a waning moon but the sport persists. Roller skating continues to thrive as a part of pop culture in the form of recreation for leisure, dance and sport.

The skate contained a pivoting action using a rubber cushion that allowed the skater to skate a curve just by pressing his weight to one side or the other, most commonly by leaning to one side. It was a huge success, so much so that the first public roller skating rinks were opened in 1866, first in New York City by Plimpton in his furniture store and then in [[Newport, Rhode Island]] with the support of Plimpton. The design of the quad skate allowed easier turns and maneuverability, and the quad skate came to dominate the industry for more than a century.\n*1875 Roller skating rink in Plymouth, England held its first competition.<ref>Lawer, Diana.

Brown's design embodied his effort to keep the two bearing surfaces of an [[axle]], fixed and moving, apart. Brown worked closely with [[Joseph Henry Hughes]], who drew up the patent for a ball or [[roller bearing]] race for bicycle and [[carriage]] wheels in 1877. Hughes' patent included all the elements of an adjustable system. These two men are thus responsible for modern roller skate and [[skateboard]] wheels, as well as the ball bearing race inclusion in [[velocipede]]s\u2014later to become [[motorbike]]s and automobiles. This was arguably the most important advance in the realistic use of roller skates as a pleasurable pastime.\n[[Image:1908-PatinsRoulettes.jpg|thumb|right|An advert for an early 20th-century model which fit over ordinary shoes]]\n*1876: The toe stop was first patented. This provided skaters with the ability to stop promptly upon tipping the skate onto the toe. Toe stops are still used today on most quad skates and on some types of inline skates.\n*1877: The ''Royal Skating'' indoor skating ring building is erected rue Veydt, Brussels.<ref>The building still exists in 2011 and swapped its original function to an Art Gallery</ref>\n*1880s: Roller skates were being mass-produced in America from then. This was the sport's first of several boom periods. [[Micajah C. Henley]] of [[Richmond, Indiana]] produced thousands of skates every week during peak sales. Henley skates were the first skate with adjustable tension via a screw, the ancestor of the [[kingbolt]] mechanism on modern quad skates.\n*1884: [[Levant M. Richardson]] received a patent for the use of steel [[ball bearings]] in skate wheels to reduce friction, allowing skaters to increase speed with minimum effort.\n*1898: Richardson started the [[Richardson Ball Bearing and Skate Company]], which provided skates to most professional skate racers of the time, including Harley Davidson (no relation to the [[Harley-Davidson]] motorcycle brand).

The Rollerblade skates became synonymous in the minds of many with \"inline skates\" and skating, so much so that many people came to call any form of skating \"Rollerblading,\" thus making it a [[genericized trademark]].\n\nFor much of the 1980s and into the 1990s, inline skate models typically sold for general public use employed a hard plastic boot, similar to [[ski boots]]. In or about 1995, \"soft boot\" designs were introduced to the market, primarily by the [[Sports equipment|sporting goods]] firm [[K2 Sports|K2 Inc.]], and promoted for use as fitness skates. Other companies quickly followed, and by the early 2000s the development of hard shell skates and skeletons became primarily limited to the [[Aggressive inline skating]] discipline and other specialized designs.\n\nThe single-wheel \"quintessence skate\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://onewheelskate.tripod.com/|title=Quintessence Skate Qskate OneWheelSkate bicycleskate qs8 gailson|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041129203053/http://onewheelskate.tripod.com/|archivedate=29 November 2004|df=dmy-all}}</ref> was made in 1988 by Miyshael F.

These are usually accomplished on quad skates, but [[inline skates]] may be used for some events.  Various flights of events are organized by age and ability/experience.  In the US, local competitions lead to 9 regional competitions which led to the National Championships and World Championships.\n\n===Figures===\nA prescribed movement symmetrically composed of at least two circles, but not more than three circles, involving primary, or primary and secondary movements, with or without turns. Figures are skated on circles, which have been inscribed on the skating surface.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://usars.info/rules/figure/FigureTechManuals101506.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=23 February 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130204002522/http://usars.info/rules/figure/FigureTechManuals101506.pdf |archivedate=4 February 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/roller-sports|title=Roller Sports {{!}} The Canadian Encyclopedia|website=www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca|access-date=2019-02-27}}</ref>\n\n===Dance===\n\nIn competition skaters can enter more than one event;\n\nSolo Dance; solo dance a competition starts at tiny tot and goes up to golden, for a test it starts with bronze and goes up to gold. You do not have to take tests anymore to skate in harder categories, you must have a couple of tests once you get to a certain event, though. In competition, these dances are set patterns and the judges give you marks for good edges, how neat they look and how well they do turns, etc.\n\nTeam Dance; this is where two people skate together doing the set dances. Most people skate with a partner the same ability and age.\n\nSkaters are judged by the accuracy of steps that they skate when performing a particular dance. In addition to being judged on their edges and turns, skaters must carry themselves in an elegant manner while paying careful attention to the rhythm and timing of the music.\n\n===Freestyle===\nFreestyle roller dancing is a style of physical movement, usually done to music, that is not choreographed or planned ahead of time. It occurs in many genres, including those where people dance with partners. By definition, this kind of dance is never the same from performance to performance, although it can be done formally and informally, sometimes using some sparse choreography as a very loose outline for the improvisation.\n\n===Precision teams===\nA team of skaters (usually counted in multiples of 4) creates various patterns and movements to music.  Often used elements include skating in a line, skating in a box, 'splicing' (subgroups skating towards each other such that they do not contact each other), and skating in a circle.  The team is judged on its choreography and the ability to skate together precisely.\n\n===Singles and pairs===\nA single skater or a pair of skaters present routines to music.  They are judged on skating ability and creativity.  Jumps, spins and turns are expected in these events. Sometimes with a pair or couple skaters slow music will play, and usually it is two songs.\n\n== Speed skating==\nSpeed skating originally started on traditional roller skates, quads or four wheels per skate. The first organized, national competition was held in 1938 in Detroit Michigan at the Arena Gardens Roller Rink, once home of \"Detroit's Premier Sports Palace. The Arena opened in 1935 as roller skating began its ascension as a top sport.<ref name=\":0\" /> In the early years, competitors representing the mid-west states, primarily Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Ohio dominated the sport. By 1950 as rinks hired speed skating coaches who trained competitors, the east and west coast began to compete effectively for the national titles. But in the early years, national titles were dominated by Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland and Cincinnati.\n\nAs rules were established for state and national competitions, the speed skating season began in fall and continued through spring leading up to a state tournament. Eventually approximately 1947, due to the growth of speed skating, the top three places at a state tournament would qualify skaters for a regional tournament. The top three places at regional tournaments then went on to compete at a national tournament. Skaters could qualify as individuals or as part of a two-person or four-person (relay) team. Qualification at regional events could warrant an invite to the Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs, CO for a one-week training session on their outdoor velodrome. [[Inline speed skating]] is a competitive non-contact sport on inline skates.  Variants include indoor, track and [[road skating|road]] racing, with many different grades of skaters, so the whole family can compete.\n\n==Group skating==\n[[Image:Inline skating.jpg|thumb|right|Inline roller skater on a slalom course]]\nAmong skaters not committed to a particular discipline, a popular social activity is the ''group skate'' or [[Street skating|street skate]], in which large groups of skaters regularly meet to skate together, usually on city streets. One such group is the San Francisco Midnight Rollers. In 1989 the small 15-20 group that became the Midnight Rollers explored the closed doubIe-decker Embarcadero Freeway after the Loma-Prieta earthquake until it was torn down.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cora.org/FNSNewsIndy95.htm|title=Friday Night Fever|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150725012749/http://www.cora.org/FNSNewsIndy95.htm|archivedate=25 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> At which point the new route was created settling on Friday nights at 9 pm from the San Francisco Ferry Building circling 12 miles around the city back at midnight to the start.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cora.org/Bladerunners96.html|title=SKATERS, UNITE!|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150725014006/http://www.cora.org/Bladerunners96.html|archivedate=25 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cora.org/Sunset4-98.htm|title=rocking and rolling in the city|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150725012747/http://www.cora.org/Sunset4-98.htm|archivedate=25 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cora.org/Forbes4-3-00.htm|title=The Mild Ones|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150725011840/http://www.cora.org/Forbes4-3-00.htm|archivedate=25 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/S-F-s-Friday-Night-Skate-a-weekly-party-on-wheels-4930970.php|title=S.F.'s Friday Night Skate a weekly party on wheels|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150725013948/http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/S-F-s-Friday-Night-Skate-a-weekly-party-on-wheels-4930970.php/|archivedate=25 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Although such touring existed among quad roller skate clubs in the 1970s and 1980s, it made the jump to inline skates in 1990 with groups in large cities throughout the United States. <!-- This doesn't need to be a list of every city that had group skates; that's trivial and not necessary to the context of the article.

At times, it has had as many as 35,000 skaters participating on the boulevards of Paris, on a single night. The Sunday Skate Night in Berlin also attracts over 10,000 skaters during the summer, and [[Copenhagen]], [[Munich]], [[Frankfurt]], [[Amsterdam]], [[Buenos Aires]], London, [[San Francisco]], Los Angeles, New York, and Tokyo host other popular events. Charity skates in Paris have attracted 50,000 participants (the yearly Paris-Versailles skate). The current Official Guinness World Record holder is Nightskating Warszawa (Poland) in number of 4013 participants from 19 June 2014, but their real record from 25 April 2015 is 7303 participants and over 38 000 skaters total in 10 events in season 2015.\n\n==Aggressive inline==\n[[Aggressive inline skating]] is trick-based skating. This is where the individual performs tricks using a slightly different skate to normal. The skate has a grind block in between two wheels and the various companies have designed the boots to take these extra strains. Also the wheels have a flat large contact surface for grip.\n\nAggressive inline can either take place at a skate park or on the street. Typically predominantly grinds but also air tricks such as spins and flips.\n\n== Roller hockey (quad)==\n[[Roller hockey]] is the overarching name for a rollersport that existed long before inline skates were invented. Roller hockey has been played on quad skates in many countries worldwide and so has many names. [[Roller hockey at the 1992 Summer Olympics]] was a demonstration rollersport in the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in [[Barcelona]].\n\n==Skating federations==\nIn the United States, the controlling organization is [[USA Roller Sports]], headquartered in [[Lincoln, Nebraska]], also home of the National Museum of Roller Skating.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollerskatingmuseum.com/|title=The National Museum of Roller Skating|author=National Museum of Roller Skating|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928002604/http://www.rollerskatingmuseum.com/|archivedate=28 September 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Nationals are held each summer with skaters required to qualify through state and regional competitions.\n\n== Roller derby ==\n[[Roller derby]] is a team sport played on roller skates on an oval track.  Originally a trademarked product developed out of speed skating demonstrations, the sport is currently experiencing a revival as a grass-roots-driven 5-a-side sport played mainly by women.  Most roller derby leagues adopt the rules and guidelines set by the [[Women's Flat Track Derby Association]] or its male counterpart, [[Men's Roller Derby Association]], but there are leagues that play on a banked track, as the sport was originally from c.1933-1998.\n\n== Aggressive roller skating ==\n[[File:Roller skate trucks.jpg|alt=Photo of two different roller skate trucks|thumb|Standard roller skate (quad) trucks compared to 3 inch wide skate board (Penny) trucks (bottom).]]\nOtherwise known as \"park skating\", popularized by CIB (fka Chicks in Bowls<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cibcrew.com/blogs/news/theevolutionofcib|title=The Evolution of CIB|website=CIB Crew|language=en|access-date=2019-12-04}}</ref>) and Moxi Roller Skates, this form of roller skating involves performing tricks and airs in mini ramps, street, vert, and bowls. Any roller skate can be used for park skating though many skaters prefer a higher-ankle boot over speed style boot. Additional modifications to traditional rollers skates include the addition of a plastic block between the front and rear trucks commonly called slide blocks or grind blocks. The front and rear trucks can also be modified to use a 3-inch wide truck to allow for different tricks.\n\n==Other groups==\nOther groups include:\n\n* [[International Roller Sports Federation]] (''F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Roller Sports'')\n* [[British Federation of Roller Skating]]\n* [[Skate Australia]]\n\n==In popular culture==\n*1907 - ''An Awful Skate'', the first silent movie by the Essanay Film Company at a time when Chicago was movie capital of the nation<ref name=\":0\" />\n*1916 - [[Charlie Chaplin]] film ''[[The Rink (film)|The Rink]]'' is partially set at a roller skating rink & roller skating party.\n*1950 - In the film ''[[The Fireball]]'', [[Mickey Rooney]] skates with [[Marilyn Monroe]] as then-new media TV brought [[roller derby]] into the homes of millions.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*1955 - [[Gene Kelly]] used roller skates as part of a dance routine in ''[[It's Always Fair Weather]]''.\n*1971 - The song \"[[Brand New Key]]\" by [[Melanie (singer)|Melanie]] uses roller skates as a theme.\n*1972 - ''[[Kansas City Bomber]]'', starring [[Raquel Welch]], is about the roller derby scene.\n*1975 - ''[[Rollerball (1975 film)|Rollerball]]'' is a dystopian science fiction film centered on a roller skate-based tournament.\n*1978 - [[Linda Ronstadt]] dons a roller skating outfit on the cover of her album ''[[Living in the USA]]'' and in its promotional materials, which helps bring the sport a resurgence of interest in the United States.\n*1979 - ''[[Skatetown, U.S.A.]]'' with [[Scott Baio]], [[Flip Wilson]], [[Patrick Swayze]] and [[Maureen McCormick]].\n*1979 - ''[[Roller Boogie]]'' with [[Linda Blair]].\n*1980 - ''[[Xanadu (film)|Xanadu]]'', with [[Olivia Newton-John]] and Gene Kelly, has rollerskating as a recurring theme.\n*1980 - ''[[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]]'', with [[Kris Kristofferson]] and [[Christopher Walken]], set in 1890s Wyoming, features a scene in an early roller-skating rink called \"Heaven's Gate\". \n*1983 - ''[[Star 80]]'' includes a roller-skating party at the [[Playboy Mansion]].                                          \n*1984 - ''[[Starlight Express]]'', a musical written by [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]], opened on London's [[West End theatre|West End]].

In addition to rollerblades/inline skates, there have also been:\n* [[Soap shoes|Soaps]], normal-looking street/[[skate shoes]] with a concave plastic plate in the sole to allow [[grind (sport)|grinds]].\n* [[Heelys]], normal-looking street/skate shoes with a single retractable wheel in the heel of each shoe, allowing the wearer to perform unique rollerskating-like moves at leisure while still walking normally when the skating functionality isn't desired (and the wheel is mostly retracted into a recessed slot in the heel). The fact that skateboarding and related wheeled sports are [[skateboarding is not a crime|outlawed]] in many cities and suburbs makes the low key and spontaneous nature of Heelys all the more enticing to the same demographic. Heelys were later also combined with Soaps into a single hybrid shoe.\n* [[Freeline skates]], a class of unattached skates that wearers place under their normal street or skate shoes. They typically have 2 closely set inline wheels set with a short base under a small squarish plate (usually surfaced with [[grip tape]] about the same width as the rider's shoe). This arrangement allows for a range of motion similar to single-wheeled skates like Heelys. Due to the lack of straps on the contact plate, freeline skates require constant motion to stay on, and are a particular challenge for novices.\n* Two-wheeled skates: there are also other lesser seen two-wheeled skate arrangements. Some resemble inline skates but with 2 very large wheels bolted in at an angle from the outside rather than a center-balanced row of 4 smaller wheels underneath of inline skates. Others resemble freeline skates in that they have a small squarish platform, but with 2 medium-sized wheels on either side, somewhat between a freeline skate and roller skates (but with inline-skate-styled wheels).\n* Orbit wheel skates, another spiritual relative of the freeline skate whereby the skate stands on a grip-tape-surfaced platform (just slightly larger than a freeline skate's) inside of a large hoop that contains a trapped wheel that can freely rotate under the grip plate each foot is planted on. The foot plates normally rest on the trough of the inner surface of these orbital wheels, with the toes pointing [[orthogonal]] to the rotation of the ringed wheel. It's said the experience of riding them is somewhat similar to skateboarding, and there are variants with the two wheels connected so the rider is fixed in a skateboarding-like stance.\n\n==See also==\n{{col-begin}}{{col-break}}\n*[[Aggressive inline skating]] {{nb10}}\n*[[Freeline skates]]\n*[[Heelys]]\n*[[Inline skates]]\n*[[Inline speed skating]]\n*[[Powerslide (inline skating)|Powerslide]]\n{{col-break}}\n*[[Roller hockey]]\n*[[Road skating]]\n*[[Roller derby]]\n*[[Sidesurf]]\n*[[Soap shoes]]\n*[[Starlight Express]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n==References==\n;Notes\n{{Reflist}}\n\n;Bibliography\n* {{cite book | author=Turner, James, in collaboration with Zaidman, Michael | title=The History of Roller Skating | publisher=National Museum of Roller Skating | year=1997 | isbn=0-9658192-0-5}}\n* [http://www.rollerskatingmuseum.com/museum/homewrk_pg.htm National Museum of Roller Skating: Homework Page]\n* {{cite book | author=United States Amateur Confederation of Roller Skating| title=American Roller Skate Dancing Part I Bronze and Silver Dances Edition X| publisher= An Official USAC/RS Publication| year=1980 |page=9}}\n* {{cite book | author=Pickard, George| title=Titans and Heroes of American Roller Skating | publisher=National Museum of Roller Skating | year=2010 }}\n*Russo, Tom, (2017) ''Chicago Rink Rats: The Roller Capital in Its Heyday''.

It is a form of [[recreation|recreational activity]] as well as a sport, and can also be a form of transportation. In fact, as the United States readied for [[World War II]], the government entertained the notion to add roller skates as essential equipment to move infantry around Europe to save gas. Skates generally come in three basic varieties: quad [[roller skates]], [[inline skates]] or blades and tri-skates, though some have experimented with a single-wheeled \"quintessence skate\" or other variations on the basic skate design. In America, this hobby was most popular first between 1935 and the early 1960s and then in the 1970s, when polyurethane wheels were created and [[Disco|disco music]] oriented roller rinks were the rage and then again in the 1990s when in-line outdoor roller skating, thanks to the improvement made to inline roller skates in 1981 by Scott Olson, took hold.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Roller skates, 1910.jpg|thumb|Young man on the Edvard Petrini's pedaled roller skates,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/patents?id=4ro-AAAAEBAJ|title=Patent US809980 - Roller-skate.}}</ref> known as ''Takypod'' in Sweden, circa 1910]]Roller skating has had a checkered past over its nearly-three century history. Given its ebb and flow of popularity over the past century, writers labeled each generation's attraction a \"craze!\"  The caption in a 1904 Decatur newspaper read, \"Old Craze Comes Back,\" adding, \"Roller skating promises to be as popular as it was twenty years ago.\" Reported on 11 October 1904, the statement announced the opening events of a new Decatur, Illinois roller rink.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Old Craze Comes Back|date=11 October 1904|work=Decatur Daily Review}}</ref> In 1906, with the opening of another Chicago rink, the ''Inter Ocean'' newspaper complained that \"after twenty years of exemption from the affliction the desire to roll is again taking possession of American adults...the mania has struck Chicago!\"<ref>{{Cite news|title=Shall We All Roll Again?|date=22 October 1906|work=Inter Ocean|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nNearly forty years later, Charlie Tyler would write, \"This current roller skating 'craze' is nothing new.\" Tyler wrote for Chicago's ''Herald-American'' in September 1941 and described the opening of Chicago's Madison Gardens Rink's thirty-fifth season on the eve of World War II.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Rollin Round Roller Rinks|last=Tyler|first=Charlie|date=25 September 1941|work=Chicago Herald-American|access-date=}}</ref> Tyler was referring to the first roller skate craze at the turn of the twentieth century,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/news/topics/rollerskating.html|title=Topics in Chronicling America - Roller Skating Craze, Newspapers and Current Periodical Reading Room|last=Library of Congress|date=2 May 2013|website=Library of Congress|access-date=2 December 2018}}</ref> when ball bearings revolutionized roller technology and roller skaters staged spectacle events and speed-skating marathons. Clamp-on skates were mass-produced for those with great aspirations. Tyler's reporting attempted to temper the rebirth of enthusiasm for the new roller styles that had become popular, including roller derby and dancing on rollers, suggesting that we had seen this before. Today, the acceptance for roller skating is not unlike a waning moon but the sport persists. Roller skating continues to thrive as a part of pop culture in the form of recreation for leisure, dance and sport.

The skate contained a pivoting action using a rubber cushion that allowed the skater to skate a curve just by pressing his weight to one side or the other, most commonly by leaning to one side. It was a huge success, so much so that the first public roller skating rinks were opened in 1866, first in New York City by Plimpton in his furniture store and then in [[Newport, Rhode Island]] with the support of Plimpton. The design of the quad skate allowed easier turns and maneuverability, and the quad skate came to dominate the industry for more than a century.\n*1875 Roller skating rink in Plymouth, England held its first competition.<ref>Lawer, Diana. Get Your Skates On! : A History of Plymouth's Roller Skating Rinks, 1874-1989, Plymouth: Three Towns, 2007</ref>\n*1876: [[William Brown (inventor)|William Brown]] in [[Birmingham]], England, patented a design for the wheels of roller skates. Brown's design embodied his effort to keep the two bearing surfaces of an [[axle]], fixed and moving, apart. Brown worked closely with [[Joseph Henry Hughes]], who drew up the patent for a ball or [[roller bearing]] race for bicycle and [[carriage]] wheels in 1877. Hughes' patent included all the elements of an adjustable system. These two men are thus responsible for modern roller skate and [[skateboard]] wheels, as well as the ball bearing race inclusion in [[velocipede]]s\u2014later to become [[motorbike]]s and automobiles. This was arguably the most important advance in the realistic use of roller skates as a pleasurable pastime.\n[[Image:1908-PatinsRoulettes.jpg|thumb|right|An advert for an early 20th-century model which fit over ordinary shoes]]\n*1876: The toe stop was first patented. This provided skaters with the ability to stop promptly upon tipping the skate onto the toe. Toe stops are still used today on most quad skates and on some types of inline skates.\n*1877: The ''Royal Skating'' indoor skating ring building is erected rue Veydt, Brussels.<ref>The building still exists in 2011 and swapped its original function to an Art Gallery</ref>\n*1880s: Roller skates were being mass-produced in America from then. This was the sport's first of several boom periods. [[Micajah C. Henley]] of [[Richmond, Indiana]] produced thousands of skates every week during peak sales. Henley skates were the first skate with adjustable tension via a screw, the ancestor of the [[kingbolt]] mechanism on modern quad skates.\n*1884: [[Levant M. Richardson]] received a patent for the use of steel [[ball bearings]] in skate wheels to reduce friction, allowing skaters to increase speed with minimum effort.\n*1898: Richardson started the [[Richardson Ball Bearing and Skate Company]], which provided skates to most professional skate racers of the time, including Harley Davidson (no relation to the [[Harley-Davidson]] motorcycle brand).

The Rollerblade skates became synonymous in the minds of many with \"inline skates\" and skating, so much so that many people came to call any form of skating \"Rollerblading,\" thus making it a [[genericized trademark]].\n\nFor much of the 1980s and into the 1990s, inline skate models typically sold for general public use employed a hard plastic boot, similar to [[ski boots]]. In or about 1995, \"soft boot\" designs were introduced to the market, primarily by the [[Sports equipment|sporting goods]] firm [[K2 Sports|K2 Inc.]], and promoted for use as fitness skates.

Gailson of [[Caples Lake Resort, California]], for the purpose of cross-country [[skate skiing]] and [[telemark skiing]] training. Other experimental skate designs the years have included two wheeled (heel and toe) inline skate frames but the vast majority of skates on the market today are either quad or standard inline design.\n\n==Artistic roller skating==\n[[Image:Wiki sk8 pair1.png|thumb|Stopless quad skate plates]]\n[[Artistic roller skating]] is a sport which consists of a number of events.  These are usually accomplished on quad skates, but [[inline skates]] may be used for some events.  Various flights of events are organized by age and ability/experience.  In the US, local competitions lead to 9 regional competitions which led to the National Championships and World Championships.\n\n===Figures===\nA prescribed movement symmetrically composed of at least two circles, but not more than three circles, involving primary, or primary and secondary movements, with or without turns. Figures are skated on circles, which have been inscribed on the skating surface.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://usars.info/rules/figure/FigureTechManuals101506.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=23 February 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130204002522/http://usars.info/rules/figure/FigureTechManuals101506.pdf |archivedate=4 February 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/roller-sports|title=Roller Sports {{!}} The Canadian Encyclopedia|website=www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca|access-date=2019-02-27}}</ref>\n\n===Dance===\n\nIn competition skaters can enter more than one event;\n\nSolo Dance; solo dance a competition starts at tiny tot and goes up to golden, for a test it starts with bronze and goes up to gold. You do not have to take tests anymore to skate in harder categories, you must have a couple of tests once you get to a certain event, though. In competition, these dances are set patterns and the judges give you marks for good edges, how neat they look and how well they do turns, etc.\n\nTeam Dance; this is where two people skate together doing the set dances. Most people skate with a partner the same ability and age.\n\nSkaters are judged by the accuracy of steps that they skate when performing a particular dance. In addition to being judged on their edges and turns, skaters must carry themselves in an elegant manner while paying careful attention to the rhythm and timing of the music.\n\n===Freestyle===\nFreestyle roller dancing is a style of physical movement, usually done to music, that is not choreographed or planned ahead of time. It occurs in many genres, including those where people dance with partners. By definition, this kind of dance is never the same from performance to performance, although it can be done formally and informally, sometimes using some sparse choreography as a very loose outline for the improvisation.\n\n===Precision teams===\nA team of skaters (usually counted in multiples of 4) creates various patterns and movements to music.  Often used elements include skating in a line, skating in a box, 'splicing' (subgroups skating towards each other such that they do not contact each other), and skating in a circle.  The team is judged on its choreography and the ability to skate together precisely.\n\n===Singles and pairs===\nA single skater or a pair of skaters present routines to music.  They are judged on skating ability and creativity.  Jumps, spins and turns are expected in these events. Sometimes with a pair or couple skaters slow music will play, and usually it is two songs.\n\n== Speed skating==\nSpeed skating originally started on traditional roller skates, quads or four wheels per skate. The first organized, national competition was held in 1938 in Detroit Michigan at the Arena Gardens Roller Rink, once home of \"Detroit's Premier Sports Palace. The Arena opened in 1935 as roller skating began its ascension as a top sport.<ref name=\":0\" /> In the early years, competitors representing the mid-west states, primarily Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Ohio dominated the sport. By 1950 as rinks hired speed skating coaches who trained competitors, the east and west coast began to compete effectively for the national titles. But in the early years, national titles were dominated by Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland and Cincinnati.\n\nAs rules were established for state and national competitions, the speed skating season began in fall and continued through spring leading up to a state tournament. Eventually approximately 1947, due to the growth of speed skating, the top three places at a state tournament would qualify skaters for a regional tournament. The top three places at regional tournaments then went on to compete at a national tournament. Skaters could qualify as individuals or as part of a two-person or four-person (relay) team. Qualification at regional events could warrant an invite to the Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs, CO for a one-week training session on their outdoor velodrome. [[Inline speed skating]] is a competitive non-contact sport on inline skates.  Variants include indoor, track and [[road skating|road]] racing, with many different grades of skaters, so the whole family can compete.\n\n==Group skating==\n[[Image:Inline skating.jpg|thumb|right|Inline roller skater on a slalom course]]\nAmong skaters not committed to a particular discipline, a popular social activity is the ''group skate'' or [[Street skating|street skate]], in which large groups of skaters regularly meet to skate together, usually on city streets. One such group is the San Francisco Midnight Rollers. In 1989 the small 15-20 group that became the Midnight Rollers explored the closed doubIe-decker Embarcadero Freeway after the Loma-Prieta earthquake until it was torn down.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cora.org/FNSNewsIndy95.htm|title=Friday Night Fever|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150725012749/http://www.cora.org/FNSNewsIndy95.htm|archivedate=25 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> At which point the new route was created settling on Friday nights at 9 pm from the San Francisco Ferry Building circling 12 miles around the city back at midnight to the start.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cora.org/Bladerunners96.html|title=SKATERS, UNITE!|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150725014006/http://www.cora.org/Bladerunners96.html|archivedate=25 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cora.org/Sunset4-98.htm|title=rocking and rolling in the city|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150725012747/http://www.cora.org/Sunset4-98.htm|archivedate=25 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cora.org/Forbes4-3-00.htm|title=The Mild Ones|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150725011840/http://www.cora.org/Forbes4-3-00.htm|archivedate=25 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/S-F-s-Friday-Night-Skate-a-weekly-party-on-wheels-4930970.php|title=S.F.'s Friday Night Skate a weekly party on wheels|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150725013948/http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/S-F-s-Friday-Night-Skate-a-weekly-party-on-wheels-4930970.php/|archivedate=25 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Although such touring existed among quad roller skate clubs in the 1970s and 1980s, it made the jump to inline skates in 1990 with groups in large cities throughout the United States. <!-- This doesn't need to be a list of every city that had group skates; that's trivial and not necessary to the context of the article. Please don't add more cities here. --> In some cases, hundreds of skaters would regularly participate, resembling a rolling party. In the late 1990s, the group skate phenomenon spread to Europe and east Asia. The weekly Friday night skate in Paris, France (called Pari Roller<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pari-roller.com/|title=Pari Roller - La Friday Night Fever !|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080130161111/http://www.pari-roller.com/|archivedate=30 January 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref>) is believed to be one of the largest repeating group skates in the world. At times, it has had as many as 35,000 skaters participating on the boulevards of Paris, on a single night. The Sunday Skate Night in Berlin also attracts over 10,000 skaters during the summer, and [[Copenhagen]], [[Munich]], [[Frankfurt]], [[Amsterdam]], [[Buenos Aires]], London, [[San Francisco]], Los Angeles, New York, and Tokyo host other popular events. Charity skates in Paris have attracted 50,000 participants (the yearly Paris-Versailles skate). The current Official Guinness World Record holder is Nightskating Warszawa (Poland) in number of 4013 participants from 19 June 2014, but their real record from 25 April 2015 is 7303 participants and over 38 000 skaters total in 10 events in season 2015.\n\n==Aggressive inline==\n[[Aggressive inline skating]] is trick-based skating. This is where the individual performs tricks using a slightly different skate to normal. The skate has a grind block in between two wheels and the various companies have designed the boots to take these extra strains. Also the wheels have a flat large contact surface for grip.\n\nAggressive inline can either take place at a skate park or on the street. Typically predominantly grinds but also air tricks such as spins and flips.\n\n== Roller hockey (quad)==\n[[Roller hockey]] is the overarching name for a rollersport that existed long before inline skates were invented. Roller hockey has been played on quad skates in many countries worldwide and so has many names. [[Roller hockey at the 1992 Summer Olympics]] was a demonstration rollersport in the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in [[Barcelona]].\n\n==Skating federations==\nIn the United States, the controlling organization is [[USA Roller Sports]], headquartered in [[Lincoln, Nebraska]], also home of the National Museum of Roller Skating.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollerskatingmuseum.com/|title=The National Museum of Roller Skating|author=National Museum of Roller Skating|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928002604/http://www.rollerskatingmuseum.com/|archivedate=28 September 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Nationals are held each summer with skaters required to qualify through state and regional competitions.\n\n== Roller derby ==\n[[Roller derby]] is a team sport played on roller skates on an oval track.  Originally a trademarked product developed out of speed skating demonstrations, the sport is currently experiencing a revival as a grass-roots-driven 5-a-side sport played mainly by women.  Most roller derby leagues adopt the rules and guidelines set by the [[Women's Flat Track Derby Association]] or its male counterpart, [[Men's Roller Derby Association]], but there are leagues that play on a banked track, as the sport was originally from c.1933-1998.\n\n== Aggressive roller skating ==\n[[File:Roller skate trucks.jpg|alt=Photo of two different roller skate trucks|thumb|Standard roller skate (quad) trucks compared to 3 inch wide skate board (Penny) trucks (bottom).]]\nOtherwise known as \"park skating\", popularized by CIB (fka Chicks in Bowls<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cibcrew.com/blogs/news/theevolutionofcib|title=The Evolution of CIB|website=CIB Crew|language=en|access-date=2019-12-04}}</ref>) and Moxi Roller Skates, this form of roller skating involves performing tricks and airs in mini ramps, street, vert, and bowls. Any roller skate can be used for park skating though many skaters prefer a higher-ankle boot over speed style boot. Additional modifications to traditional rollers skates include the addition of a plastic block between the front and rear trucks commonly called slide blocks or grind blocks. The front and rear trucks can also be modified to use a 3-inch wide truck to allow for different tricks.\n\n==Other groups==\nOther groups include:\n\n* [[International Roller Sports Federation]] (''F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Roller Sports'')\n* [[British Federation of Roller Skating]]\n* [[Skate Australia]]\n\n==In popular culture==\n*1907 - ''An Awful Skate'', the first silent movie by the Essanay Film Company at a time when Chicago was movie capital of the nation<ref name=\":0\" />\n*1916 - [[Charlie Chaplin]] film ''[[The Rink (film)|The Rink]]'' is partially set at a roller skating rink & roller skating party.\n*1950 - In the film ''[[The Fireball]]'', [[Mickey Rooney]] skates with [[Marilyn Monroe]] as then-new media TV brought [[roller derby]] into the homes of millions.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*1955 - [[Gene Kelly]] used roller skates as part of a dance routine in ''[[It's Always Fair Weather]]''.\n*1971 - The song \"[[Brand New Key]]\" by [[Melanie (singer)|Melanie]] uses roller skates as a theme.\n*1972 - ''[[Kansas City Bomber]]'', starring [[Raquel Welch]], is about the roller derby scene.\n*1975 - ''[[Rollerball (1975 film)|Rollerball]]'' is a dystopian science fiction film centered on a roller skate-based tournament.\n*1978 - [[Linda Ronstadt]] dons a roller skating outfit on the cover of her album ''[[Living in the USA]]'' and in its promotional materials, which helps bring the sport a resurgence of interest in the United States.\n*1979 - ''[[Skatetown, U.S.A.]]'' with [[Scott Baio]], [[Flip Wilson]], [[Patrick Swayze]] and [[Maureen McCormick]].\n*1979 - ''[[Roller Boogie]]'' with [[Linda Blair]].\n*1980 - ''[[Xanadu (film)|Xanadu]]'', with [[Olivia Newton-John]] and Gene Kelly, has rollerskating as a recurring theme.\n*1980 - ''[[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]]'', with [[Kris Kristofferson]] and [[Christopher Walken]], set in 1890s Wyoming, features a scene in an early roller-skating rink called \"Heaven's Gate\". \n*1983 - ''[[Star 80]]'' includes a roller-skating party at the [[Playboy Mansion]].                                          \n*1984 - ''[[Starlight Express]]'', a musical written by [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]], opened on London's [[West End theatre|West End]].

In addition to rollerblades/inline skates, there have also been:\n* [[Soap shoes|Soaps]], normal-looking street/[[skate shoes]] with a concave plastic plate in the sole to allow [[grind (sport)|grinds]].\n* [[Heelys]], normal-looking street/skate shoes with a single retractable wheel in the heel of each shoe, allowing the wearer to perform unique rollerskating-like moves at leisure while still walking normally when the skating functionality isn't desired (and the wheel is mostly retracted into a recessed slot in the heel). The fact that skateboarding and related wheeled sports are [[skateboarding is not a crime|outlawed]] in many cities and suburbs makes the low key and spontaneous nature of Heelys all the more enticing to the same demographic. Heelys were later also combined with Soaps into a single hybrid shoe.\n* [[Freeline skates]], a class of unattached skates that wearers place under their normal street or skate shoes. They typically have 2 closely set inline wheels set with a short base under a small squarish plate (usually surfaced with [[grip tape]] about the same width as the rider's shoe). This arrangement allows for a range of motion similar to single-wheeled skates like Heelys. Due to the lack of straps on the contact plate, freeline skates require constant motion to stay on, and are a particular challenge for novices.\n* Two-wheeled skates: there are also other lesser seen two-wheeled skate arrangements. Some resemble inline skates but with 2 very large wheels bolted in at an angle from the outside rather than a center-balanced row of 4 smaller wheels underneath of inline skates. Others resemble freeline skates in that they have a small squarish platform, but with 2 medium-sized wheels on either side, somewhat between a freeline skate and roller skates (but with inline-skate-styled wheels).\n* Orbit wheel skates, another spiritual relative of the freeline skate whereby the skate stands on a grip-tape-surfaced platform (just slightly larger than a freeline skate's) inside of a large hoop that contains a trapped wheel that can freely rotate under the grip plate each foot is planted on. The foot plates normally rest on the trough of the inner surface of these orbital wheels, with the toes pointing [[orthogonal]] to the rotation of the ringed wheel. It's said the experience of riding them is somewhat similar to skateboarding, and there are variants with the two wheels connected so the rider is fixed in a skateboarding-like stance.\n\n==See also==\n{{col-begin}}{{col-break}}\n*[[Aggressive inline skating]] {{nb10}}\n*[[Freeline skates]]\n*[[Heelys]]\n*[[Inline skates]]\n*[[Inline speed skating]]\n*[[Powerslide (inline skating)|Powerslide]]\n{{col-break}}\n*[[Roller hockey]]\n*[[Road skating]]\n*[[Roller derby]]\n*[[Sidesurf]]\n*[[Soap shoes]]\n*[[Starlight Express]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n==References==\n;Notes\n{{Reflist}}\n\n;Bibliography\n* {{cite book | author=Turner, James, in collaboration with Zaidman, Michael | title=The History of Roller Skating | publisher=National Museum of Roller Skating | year=1997 | isbn=0-9658192-0-5}}\n* [http://www.rollerskatingmuseum.com/museum/homewrk_pg.htm National Museum of Roller Skating: Homework Page]\n* {{cite book | author=United States Amateur Confederation of Roller Skating| title=American Roller Skate Dancing Part I Bronze and Silver Dances Edition X| publisher= An Official USAC/RS Publication| year=1980 |page=9}}\n* {{cite book | author=Pickard, George| title=Titans and Heroes of American Roller Skating | publisher=National Museum of Roller Skating | year=2010 }}\n*Russo, Tom, (2017) ''Chicago Rink Rats: The Roller Capital in Its Heyday''.

It premiered on [[Disney Channel]] on July 26, 1986 as a part of the channel's \"Premiere Films\" presentation (a precursor to the Disney Channel Original Movies banner).\n\n[[Hayley Mills]] is the only actress that returned from the original film. She continues to portray Susan and Sharon, the twins who were separated at age one, met up twelve years later at summer camp, switched places and went on to reunite their divorced parents.\n\nThe film focuses on Sharon's daughter, Nikki, who tries to hook her mother up with her best friend Mary's father, portrayed by [[Tom Skerritt]]. It was a success for the Disney Channel and it later spawned two more made-for-television sequels, both produced in 1989.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film takes place twenty-five years after the original film. Sharon Ferris (n\u00e9e McKendrick) is divorced and living as a single mother in [[Tampa, Florida]]. Her daughter, Nikki, is not happy about their impending move to [[New York City]] and Sharon's decision to send her to an all-girls school in the fall. While in summer school, Nikki makes enemies with Jessica Dintruff (Tannen) but befriends Mary Grand. Mary's father, Bill Grand, has been widowed for four years. To stop Nikki from moving to New York City and to see their parents happily married, the girls scheme to set them up.\n\nNikki and Mary trick their parents into meeting each other by sending Sharon flowers that are supposedly from Bill, but they do not just fall madly in love with each other as the girls had hoped, so they contact Sharon's twin sister, Susan Carey (n\u00e9e Evers). She is married and still living in [[California]]. She is convinced by the girls to fly to Tampa to help them by posing as Sharon and going on a few dates just to get things started.\n\nSusan, disguised as Sharon, \"accidentally\" bumps into Bill at a bar called the Press Box and watches a few innings of a baseball game with him.  The real Sharon detests baseball, and is confused when Bill drops by her workplace the next day and mentions how much fun they had. Susan and Bill cross paths a couple more times over the next few days. Florence (Cromwell) Bill and Mary's maid, begins to suspect that something is awry.\n\nSharon discovers the girls' scheme and decides to trick them instead. She contacts Brian Carey (Harvey) Susan's husband, who is a pilot for [[Trans World Airlines]], and involves him in her scheme. While Susan and Bill are on a date, the real Sharon and Brian pretend to also be on one, with Sharon dressed as a different woman.\n\nSusan becomes distracted and clumsy on her date while watching her husband. Finally having had enough, she announces to Bill that the man she is watching is her husband. She storms over to their table, but begins laughing when she sees her sister underneath a black wig.\n\nSusan and Sharon clear up the situation for Bill, and Sharon says that she does not have romantic feelings for him, and would like it if they just remained friends.  \n\nA going away party is thrown for Sharon and Nikki on the boat of her boss, Mr. Elias. Sharon and Bill meet in the cabin while Nikki and Mary go get something from the car. The girls release the ropes from the boat and push it away from the dock. The guests begin arriving and watch helplessly as the boat drifts away.\n\nSharon and Bill are enjoying each other's company, but wonder where everyone is. They go to the deck, see how far out they are from the shore, and then, Bill kisses Sharon. The scene switches to the wedding. Mary and Nikki are finally step-sisters and Nikki doesn't have to move to New York City.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Hayley Mills]] as Sharon Ferris and Susan Carey\n* [[Tom Skerritt]] as William \"Bill\" Grand\n* [[Carrie Kei Heim]] as Nicole \"Nikki\" Ferris\n* [[Bridgette Andersen]] as Mary Grand\n* Alex Harvey as Brian Carey\n* Gloria Cromwell as Florence\n* Judith Tannen as Jessica Dintroff\n\n== Production ==\n=== Writing ===\nThe idea of a second film was announced in 1985. On her interview with ''[[Good Morning America]]'' that year, Mills wasn't sure about reprising her role as the twins. \"I was astonished. I thought what they wanted to do was try to repeat the original film in some way. I wasn't too sure that was a very good idea. It was a good film, and it has passed the test of time,\" Mills said to the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''.\n\n\"I did hesitate before saying yes,\" said Mills, \"first because it was always my favorite film and I wasn't sure about making a sequel. Second, because it's taken me so long to try to break away from my Disney image. It's been a real impediment toward getting the kind of roles I want. But everyone at Disney was so enthusiastic about the project that I finally agreed to do it. And I think it's turned out well.\"<ref name=\"mills\">A GROWN-UP HAYLEY MILLS FINDS PARENTING NO `TRAP Mann, Roderick. Los Angeles Times 22 Feb 1986: 1. </ref>\n\nThe film was written by Stuart Krieger. In the original draft of the script, Sharon was originally going to have a son, instead of a daughter like she does in the finished product. This was changed when rewrites of the script were ordered. The names of Nikki Ferris and Mary Grand are the same names of the characters that Mills portrayed in the Disney films ''[[The Moon-Spinners]]'' and ''[[In Search of the Castaways (film)|In Search of the Castaways]]''. Director Ronald F. Maxwell revealed that this was an homage to Mills' films with [[The Walt Disney Company]].\n\nThe characters of Walter and Lillian Elias are named after [[Walt Disney]] and his wife. (Disney's full name was Walter Elias Disney; Lillian was his [[Lillian Disney|wife]]'s name.)\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[Ronald F. Maxwell]] was chosen to direct this sequel, taking over from the original's director [[David Swift (director)|David Swift]]. When the film premiered on the [[Disney Channel]], a documentary titled ''On Location: Parent Trap II'' accompanied it. The documentary included footage of Mills as she describes the production of the film and her history with the [[Disney films]].<ref>http://www.ultimatedisney.com/parenttrap-2moviecollection.html></ref> Filming took place for three weeks in the Tampa area. The exteriors of Robert E. Lee Elementary and the interiors of Mitchell Elementary were used as the summer school that Nicky and Mary both attend.\n\nThe film was shot in 18 days. \"I never worked so hard in my life,\" said Mills.<ref name=\"mills\"/>\n\nA local [[Publix]] was used as the grocery store where Susan and Sharon narrowly miss meeting each other. It has been remodeled drastically since filming had wrapped.\n\n=== Music ===\nThe film's score was composed by [[Charles Fox (composer)|Charles Fox]].

It premiered on [[Disney Channel]] on July 26, 1986 as a part of the channel's \"Premiere Films\" presentation (a precursor to the Disney Channel Original Movies banner).\n\n[[Hayley Mills]] is the only actress that returned from the original film. She continues to portray Susan and Sharon, the twins who were separated at age one, met up twelve years later at summer camp, switched places and went on to reunite their divorced parents.\n\nThe film focuses on Sharon's daughter, Nikki, who tries to hook her mother up with her best friend Mary's father, portrayed by [[Tom Skerritt]]. It was a success for the Disney Channel and it later spawned two more made-for-television sequels, both produced in 1989.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film takes place twenty-five years after the original film. Sharon Ferris (n\u00e9e McKendrick) is divorced and living as a single mother in [[Tampa, Florida]]. Her daughter, Nikki, is not happy about their impending move to [[New York City]] and Sharon's decision to send her to an all-girls school in the fall. While in summer school, Nikki makes enemies with Jessica Dintruff (Tannen) but befriends Mary Grand. Mary's father, Bill Grand, has been widowed for four years. To stop Nikki from moving to New York City and to see their parents happily married, the girls scheme to set them up.\n\nNikki and Mary trick their parents into meeting each other by sending Sharon flowers that are supposedly from Bill, but they do not just fall madly in love with each other as the girls had hoped, so they contact Sharon's twin sister, Susan Carey (n\u00e9e Evers). She is married and still living in [[California]]. She is convinced by the girls to fly to Tampa to help them by posing as Sharon and going on a few dates just to get things started.\n\nSusan, disguised as Sharon, \"accidentally\" bumps into Bill at a bar called the Press Box and watches a few innings of a baseball game with him.  The real Sharon detests baseball, and is confused when Bill drops by her workplace the next day and mentions how much fun they had. Susan and Bill cross paths a couple more times over the next few days. Florence (Cromwell) Bill and Mary's maid, begins to suspect that something is awry.\n\nSharon discovers the girls' scheme and decides to trick them instead. She contacts Brian Carey (Harvey) Susan's husband, who is a pilot for [[Trans World Airlines]], and involves him in her scheme. While Susan and Bill are on a date, the real Sharon and Brian pretend to also be on one, with Sharon dressed as a different woman.\n\nSusan becomes distracted and clumsy on her date while watching her husband. Finally having had enough, she announces to Bill that the man she is watching is her husband. She storms over to their table, but begins laughing when she sees her sister underneath a black wig.\n\nSusan and Sharon clear up the situation for Bill, and Sharon says that she does not have romantic feelings for him, and would like it if they just remained friends.  \n\nA going away party is thrown for Sharon and Nikki on the boat of her boss, Mr. Elias. Sharon and Bill meet in the cabin while Nikki and Mary go get something from the car. The girls release the ropes from the boat and push it away from the dock. The guests begin arriving and watch helplessly as the boat drifts away.\n\nSharon and Bill are enjoying each other's company, but wonder where everyone is. They go to the deck, see how far out they are from the shore, and then, Bill kisses Sharon. The scene switches to the wedding. Mary and Nikki are finally step-sisters and Nikki doesn't have to move to New York City.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Hayley Mills]] as Sharon Ferris and Susan Carey\n* [[Tom Skerritt]] as William \"Bill\" Grand\n* [[Carrie Kei Heim]] as Nicole \"Nikki\" Ferris\n* [[Bridgette Andersen]] as Mary Grand\n* Alex Harvey as Brian Carey\n* Gloria Cromwell as Florence\n* Judith Tannen as Jessica Dintroff\n\n== Production ==\n=== Writing ===\nThe idea of a second film was announced in 1985. On her interview with ''[[Good Morning America]]'' that year, Mills wasn't sure about reprising her role as the twins. \"I was astonished. I thought what they wanted to do was try to repeat the original film in some way. I wasn't too sure that was a very good idea. It was a good film, and it has passed the test of time,\" Mills said to the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''.\n\n\"I did hesitate before saying yes,\" said Mills, \"first because it was always my favorite film and I wasn't sure about making a sequel. Second, because it's taken me so long to try to break away from my Disney image. It's been a real impediment toward getting the kind of roles I want. But everyone at Disney was so enthusiastic about the project that I finally agreed to do it. And I think it's turned out well.\"<ref name=\"mills\">A GROWN-UP HAYLEY MILLS FINDS PARENTING NO `TRAP Mann, Roderick. Los Angeles Times 22 Feb 1986: 1. </ref>\n\nThe film was written by Stuart Krieger. In the original draft of the script, Sharon was originally going to have a son, instead of a daughter like she does in the finished product. This was changed when rewrites of the script were ordered. The names of Nikki Ferris and Mary Grand are the same names of the characters that Mills portrayed in the Disney films ''[[The Moon-Spinners]]'' and ''[[In Search of the Castaways (film)|In Search of the Castaways]]''. Director Ronald F. Maxwell revealed that this was an homage to Mills' films with [[The Walt Disney Company]].\n\nThe characters of Walter and Lillian Elias are named after [[Walt Disney]] and his wife. (Disney's full name was Walter Elias Disney; Lillian was his [[Lillian Disney|wife]]'s name.)\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[Ronald F. Maxwell]] was chosen to direct this sequel, taking over from the original's director [[David Swift (director)|David Swift]]. When the film premiered on the [[Disney Channel]], a documentary titled ''On Location: Parent Trap II'' accompanied it. The documentary included footage of Mills as she describes the production of the film and her history with the [[Disney films]].<ref>http://www.ultimatedisney.com/parenttrap-2moviecollection.html></ref> Filming took place for three weeks in the Tampa area. The exteriors of Robert E. Lee Elementary and the interiors of Mitchell Elementary were used as the summer school that Nicky and Mary both attend.\n\nThe film was shot in 18 days. \"I never worked so hard in my life,\" said Mills.<ref name=\"mills\"/>\n\nA local [[Publix]] was used as the grocery store where Susan and Sharon narrowly miss meeting each other. It has been remodeled drastically since filming had wrapped.\n\n=== Music ===\nThe film's score was composed by [[Charles Fox (composer)|Charles Fox]]. The theme song is \"Let's Keep What We've Got,\" written by Hal David and performed by [[Marilyn McCoo]]. It appears in the opening credits while clips from the original ''The Parent Trap'' movie play, and is reprised in the closing credits when the final scene (Nicki and Mary, as junior bridesmaids/flower girls, walk up the aisle after their parents' wedding) is frozen.\n\nOther songs in the film include \"Nothin' At All,\" sung by [[Andrea Robinson (singer)|Andrea Robinson]], who would later voice Ariel's mother, Athena, in Disney's ''[[The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning]]'', and \"Stand Back,\" sung by Stephanie Mills.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n*{{IMDb title|0091721}}\n*{{amg movie|128087}}\n*{{tcmdb title|307758|Parent Trap II}}\n\n{{Lottie and Lisa}}\n{{Ronald F.

Both have already been enthroned as 17th Karmapa, and both independently have been performing ceremonial duties in the role of a Karmapa. [[Geoffrey Samuel]], an academic expert in the field testified in court, while the recognition of Ogyen Trinley \"appears to have been accepted by a majority of Karma Kagyu monasteries and lamas, there remains a substantial minority of monasteries and lamas who have not accepted Ogyen Trinley as Karmapa. In particular, these include the [[Shamar Rinpoche]], who historically has been the person most directly involved in the process of recognition.\"<ref>https://karmapaissue.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/affirm-geoffrey-samuel.pdf</ref> It is difficult to produce an objective description of the events because the most important developments are known only from conflicting accounts by those involved.\n\nThe Karmapa [[Lineage (Buddhism)|lineage]] is the most ancient [[tulku]] lineage in Tibetan Buddhism, predating the [[Dalai Lama]] lineage by more than two centuries. The lineage is an important one as the Karmapa is traditionally the head of the Karma Kagyu school.\n\nIn October 2018, after many years of discussion, both Karmapa claimants finally met in a rural location in France and issued a joint statement, urging their followers to join in efforts to help preserve the Karma Kagyu tradition.<ref>https://tricycle.org/trikedaily/karmapas-meet/</ref> In 2020, the two candidates announced a plan to move beyond politics and work together to identify the next reincarnation of the [[14th Shamarpa, Mipham Chokyi Lodro]].<ref>https://tricycle.org/trikedaily/karmapas-work-together/</ref> \n\n==Background==\n\n===Recognition of the Karmapa===\nAs with any other lineage of tulkus, the question of recognizing the new [[Rebirth (Buddhist)|incarnation]] is crucial. Sometimes, all concerned parties are sure that a particular child is indeed the new incarnation of that particular master. Such agreement was not the case with the 8th, 10th, and 12th Karmapas (each of which was resolved).<ref>[http://www.rinpoche.com/controversy.htm The Karmapa Controversy]</ref> A dispute has happened again in the case of the 17th Karmapa.\n\n[[Karmapa]]s have often been self-recognizing. That means that many incarnations (at least seven out of sixteen)<ref>Khenpo Ch\u00f6drag Tenphel Rinpoche at the International Karma-Kagy\u00fc-Conference 28th March 1996, Buddhismus Heute Nr. 20, 1996.</ref> claimed very early in life to be Karmapa, recognizing associates and colleagues of the previous incarnation. Also, each Karmapa has left indications leading to his next rebirth, often in the form of a letter. In such letters, indications regarding the location and parentage of the next incarnation were included, though usually in a poetic form that is difficult to decipher. However, the closest associates of the previous incarnation play a crucial role in the process of recognizing the next Karmapa. After all, it is they who have been closely associated with the previous incarnation and will have to raise and teach the new one.\n\nThe process of recognition has involved several different lamas since the first recognition in the early 13th century. Geoffrey Samuel writes that, \"From the late 14th century onwards until the 1790s, the primary responsibility for recognising and enthroning the Karmapa normally belong to the Shamarpa.\"<ref name=\"samuel\">[http://www.karmapa.org.nz/articles/2005/geoffreysamuel.pdf Affirmation of Geoffrey Brian Samuel in Reply] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051022080341/http://karmapa.org.nz/articles/2005/geoffreysamuel.pdf |date=2005-10-22 }}, Affirmed 11 November 2004. pp. 17-18. Statement of Professor Geoffrey Samuel, submitted as part of a court case in Australia. Samuel cites his source as Douglas and White, ''The Black Hat Lama of Tibet'', 1976: 31-110, which summarises information primarily from the Tibetan text ''zla wa chu shel gyi phreng ba''</ref> The 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Karmapas were recognised by individual followers of the early Karmapas, rather than by any tulku. The [[Shamarpa]] recognised the 5th, 6th, 9th (together with Tai Situ), 10th, 11th, and (via a search party) 12th Karmapas. Tai Situ recognised the 8th, 9th (together with the Shamarpa), 14th, and (together with [[Jamgon Kongtrul]]) 16th Karmapas. [[Goshir Gyaltsab|Gyaltsab]] Rinpoche recognised the 7th and 13th Karmapas, and the 15th Karmapa was recognised by the 9th [[Gyalwang Drukpa]] of the [[Drukpa Kagyu]].<ref name=\"samuel\"/>\n\nIn the 1790s, shortly before the recognition of the 14th Karmapa, the Tibetan government in Lhasa banned the Shamarpa from reincarnating as a result of alleged political intrigues. The Karmapa continued to recognize reincarnations of the Shamarpa, but they of necessity lived in secret and were not available to recognise the Karmapas. This ban became irrelevant when the Dalai Lama and the Karmapa both fled Tibet in the late 1950s. The ban was formally lifted in 1963.\n\nSamuel points out that, in the cases of the 7th and 13th Karmapas, the Shamarpa of that time had died at around the same time as the previous Karmapa, meaning that there was no adult Shamarpa available to take part in the recognition. Thus, Samuel argues that \"the only real exception\" to the Shamarpa's preeminent role, prior to his banning, was in the recognition of the 8th Karmapa in 1506.<ref name=\"samuel\"/> Tai Situ has been the next most actively involved in recognising Karmapas, including two of the three recognised between 1790 and 1963.\n\n==Split recognition of the current Karmapa==\nOf the two 17th Karmapas, Ogyen Trinley Dorje has been recognized by [[Situ Rinpoche]] and [[Gyaltsab Rinpoche]]. In July 1992, both asked the Office of the Dalai Lama in Dharamsala to confirm their recognition. The [[Tenzin Gyatso|14th Dalai Lama]] confirmed the recognition of Ogyen Trinley Dorje. His recognition of Ogyen Trinley Dorje as the Karmapa is, in part, attributed to a dream he had of Ogyen Trinley Dorje's birthplace. As stated by the Dalai Lama, in this dream he saw a valley at a higher latitude with multiple streams and other features. Then, in the dream, a voice with no form or body said that this was the place the Karmapa was born.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aodarzRu7zc \"Dalai Lama's Prophetic Dream About the Karmapa's Rebirth\"]</ref>\n\nOther major teachers of the Karma Kagyu lineage (e.g. the 7th [[Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche]], the 9th [[Thrangu Rinpoche]], the 7th [[Mingyur Rinpoche]], and the 9th [[Traleg Kyabgon Rinpoche]]) also hold Ogyen Trinley Dorje to be the 17th Karmapa.\n\nFor the government of the [[People's Republic of China]], Ogyen Trinley Dorje is the 17th Karmapa.<ref>[http://factsanddetails.com/china.php?itemid=1038&catid=6&subcatid=33 KARMAPA LAMA] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101215082736/http://factsanddetails.com/china.php?itemid=1038&catid=6&subcatid=33 |date=2010-12-15 }} - China Facts and Details</ref>\n\nThe first born Karmapa, Trinley Thaye Dorje, has been recognized by [[Mipham Chokyi Lodro|Shamar Rinpoche]] (regarded by some as the senior lama in the Karma Kagyu hierarchy just below the Karmapa), [[Lama Jigme Rinpoche]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jigmela.org/biography.htm |title=Lama Jigme Rinpoche |publisher=Dhagpo Kagyu Ling |accessdate=27 June 2012}}</ref> Topga Yulgyal Rinpoche, Lopon Tsechu Rinpoche, Sherab Gyaltsen Rinpoche, the Venerable Khenchen Rinpoche Drupon Trinley Paljor, and the Fourth Trungram Gyaltrul Rinpoche.\n\n[[Second Beru Khyentse|Beru Khyentse Rinpoche]] holds a distinct minority view, saying he believes both Karmapas are legitimate.<ref>[http://www.rigpedorje.com/index.php?module=pagemaster&PAGE_user_op=view_page&PAGE_id=11&MMN_position=19:18 Letter to International Dharma Community Nov 03 - Kagyu Rime Dharjay Choling<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223132820/http://www.rigpedorje.com/index.php?module=pagemaster&PAGE_user_op=view_page&PAGE_id=11&MMN_position=19:18 |date=2007-02-23 }}</ref> He states \"it is possible that there can be two Karmapas in order to benefit sentient beings because the Karmapa can manifest in many different forms\" and writes that the 14th Karmapa highlighted that \"in many universes a hundred million Karmapas have manifested.

At age seven, he was formally enthroned at [[Tsurphu Monastery]], the traditional seat of the Karmapas in Tibet. In late December 1999, he eluded his communist Chinese minders, who prevented him from undertaking most of his traditional studies and teaching activities,{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} and escaped over the [[Himalaya]] mountains to exile in [[India]]. He celebrated his twenty-first birthday on June 26, 2006. He has since 2002 hosted and lectured in the Kagyu Monlam Chemno,<ref>[http://www.kagyumonlam.org Kagyu Monlam Chemno website]</ref> a major prayer activities gathering held in Bodhgaya every year end in which major Kagyu masters and lamas participate.\n\n===Circumstances leading to candidacy===\nAfter the death of the 16th Karmapa, Shamar Rinpoche, Tai Situ Rinpoche, Jamgon Kongtrul Rinpoche, and Goshir Gyaltsab Rinpoche agreed to form a council of regents to take joint responsibility for the spiritual affairs of the Karma Kagyu lineage, alternating as the regent for the Karmapa every three years. This regency was, however, dissolved by mutual consent in 1984 having only functioned for three years after the 16th Karmapa's death.\n\nSupporters of Ogyen Trinley Dorje claim that his birth and parentage are consistent with the prediction by [[Chogyur Lingpa]], who, it is claimed, had prophetic visions of various events in the lives of the 14th through the 16th Karmapas. Many believe that Lingpa's statement that the minds of [[Tai Situpa]] and Karmapa \"are inseparably joined as one\" refers to the 17th Karmapa and the current Tai Situ Rinpoche. \"The description ... is meant to show there is disagreement in this reincarnation and the mind of the 17th Karmapa and the mind of Tai Situ Rinpoche are inseparable from each other,\" explains the Kagyu Lama [[Thrangu Rinpoche]], who is one of Ogyen Trinley Dorje's tutors. Although according to Thrangu Rinpoche the 16th Karmapa left two letters specifying a rebirth in Tibet, it is yet another prediction document, hidden in a locket and given to Tai Situpa, that has prompted criticism from the rival claimant's camp.\n\nIn January 1981, nine months before his death, the 12th Tai Situpa claims that the 16th Karmapa gave him an amulet with a yellow brocade cover, telling him, \"This is your protection amulet. In the future, it will confer great benefit.\"  Although Tai Situpa wore the locket on a gold chain for about a year after the Karmapa's death, he moved it to a side pocket, not realizing its significance or that it contained a message. Tai Situpa claims that he followed an intuition to open the amulet in 1989 and found the third prediction letter, inside an envelope marked \"Open in the Metal Horse Year.\" This letter said that the Karmapa was to be reborn \"to the north, in the east of the land of snow,\" and when interpreted at the March 1992 meeting of the council of the four regents, was taken to mean that he would be reborn in a specific valley in eastern Tibet. The letter is reproduced on the Kagyu Office website,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.kagyuoffice.org/karmapa.reference.recognition.predictionletter.html |title=The Sacred Letter of Prediction of HH the 16th Gyalwang Karmapa - Biographical Background Information - the Karmapa website<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2004-09-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041011213358/http://www.kagyuoffice.org/karmapa.reference.recognition.predictionletter.html |archive-date=2004-10-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and reads in part:\n\n<blockquote>\n''From here to the north'' [in] ''the east of'' [the Land of] ''Snow''\n''Is a country where divine thunder spontaneously blazes.''\n[In] ''a beautiful nomad's place with the sign of a cow,''\n''The method is D\u00f6ndrub and the wisdom is Lolaga.''\n[Born in] ''the year of the one used for the earth''\n[With] ''the miraculous, far-reaching sound of the white one:''\n[This] ''is the one known as Karmapa.''\n</blockquote>\n\nOgyen Trinley Dorje's mother's name is ''Loga''; his father's name is Karma ''D\u00f6ndrub'' Tashi, a name given to him by the 16th Karmapa. Both of Ogyen Trinley Dorje's parents' names were similar to the names in the letter produced by Tai Situpa. According to Michele Martin, the letter was interpreted to mean he would be \"born ... in the area of Lhathok, which translates as 'divine (''lha'') thunder (''thog'').' The name of the remote nomadic community where Ogyen Trinley Dorje was born is Bagor, of which ''ba'' means 'cow.' The next line indicates his parents, where the masculine principle ''method'' refers to his father ''D\u00f6ndrub'', and the feminine principle ''wisdom'' refers to his mother ''Lolaga.'' ''The one used for the earth'' points to an animal that plows, and Ogyen Trinley Dorje was born in the year of the Wood Ox (1985). ''The far-reaching sound of the white one'' indicates the sound of the conch shell that is said to have miraculously resounded in the sky for hours after Ogyen Trinley's birth.\"<ref>''Music in the Sky: The Life, Art, and Teaching of the 17th Karmapa Ogyen Trinley Dorje'', Michele Martin.

His father is Jamgon Mipham Rinpoche, the reincarnation of a very important [[lama]] of the [[Nyingma]] school.\n\nAt age eleven, he was formally enthroned at the Karmapa International Buddhist Institute in New Delhi.\n\n===Circumstances leading to candidacy===\nIn October 1986 Chobgye Tri Rinpoche, senior Sakya master and head of one of the three Sakya lineages, contacted the [[Shamarpa]] and informed him about a dream he had had and about a relative of his from Lhasa who brought a picture of a child who reportedly and repeatedly  announced that he was the Karmapa. In 1988 [[Lopon Tsechu Rinpoche]] was sent to obtain more information about the child.\n\nLater an unnamed lama was sent to meet with the family and the boy without revealing the real purpose of his visit. Upon meeting with the emissary the boy promptly said \"You were sent here for me.\" This along with other evidence convinced the Shamarpa that the boy was indeed the reincarnation of the late 16th Karmapa.\n\nIn March 1994, Thaye Dorje escaped with his family from Tibet and travelled to [[New Delhi]] where he was formally recognized during a welcoming ceremony. He took monastic ordination from Chobgye Tri Rinpoche and is at present undergoing a very intensive education under the guidance of Shamar Rinpoche, also studying under teachers such as Prof. Sempa Dorje, Khenpo Ch\u00f6drak Rinpoche and others. Fluent in English, he also travels extensively in the East and the West to give lectures.\n\nThaye Dorje's supporters claim that the Shamarpa is fully authorised to recognise the Karmapa, and therefore no additional recognition is required or even valid.\n\nKarma Pakshi, the 2nd Karmapa, predicted \"future Karmapas shall manifest in two Nirmanakaya forms.\" The 3rd Karmapa recognized the 1st Shamarpa as the fulfillment of this prophecy, giving the Shamar incarnates a special relationship with the Karmapas. This is supported among others by old Kagyu literature where one frequently finds the expression of the 2 Karmapas, black and red hat. Also, when referring to former reincarnation of the Shamarpa, these are often called Karmapa and can only differentiated from former Karmapa reincarnations by their name.\n\nAlthough followers{{according to whom|date=July 2017}} of Ogyen Trinley Dorje point out that he was the only candidate ''enthroned'' in Tibet, both claimants were born in Tibet[''[[wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch#Unsupported%20attributions|according to whom?]]''] and so the prediction about the return to Tibet within these two letters is fulfilled by both claimants.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nThe 16th Karmapa clearly denominated Shamarpa as \"sovereign\" of the lineage when he wrote in 1964:{{original research inline|date=July 2017}}\n\n:\"The most exalted, the lord of the lands of snow is Avalokite\u015bvara.\n:The coalescence of his essence is the glorious Karmapa. \n:Inseparable from his three mysteries, in the manner of the three lords,\n:Is his manifestation, the great emanation; the majestic sun,\n:Whom I invest now sovereign of the practice lineage's order.\n:By the power of scattering auspicious flowers of excellent virtue \n:Combined with the true words of the \u1e5bi\u1e63hi's truthfulness \n:May he successfully and everlastingly be the sovereign of the order.\" <ref>Longlife prayer for Shamarpa, included in the collected writings of the 16th Karmapa (sung bum), cit. in: {{cite web|url=http://www.karmatrinlay.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/KTRs-tribute-to-Shamarpa.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160109090605/http://www.karmatrinlay.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/KTRs-tribute-to-Shamarpa.pdf |archivedate=2016-01-09 }}</ref>\n\n==Recent developments==\n[[Image:Rumtek monastery.jpg|220px|right|thumb|Rumtek Monastery]]\nControl of [[Rumtek Monastery]], which was the seat of the 16th Karmapa in exile, has been the subject of a legal contest. In 1961 the 16th Karmapa established the '''Karmapa Charitable Trust'''. Ogyen Trinley's followers claimed that the trust was solely established for the sake of seeing to the welfare of the Karmapa's followers, providing funds for the maintenance of the monastery, and for the monks' medical fees, but that administration of the monastery was the responsibility of the Tsurphu Labrang.

Ogyen Trinley Dorje had mentioned his desire to meet the Shamarpa, and requested [[Ch\u00f6kyi Nyima Rinpoche]] arrange a personal meeting with him. The Shamarpa had declined the first invitation in 2005, which was received by telephone call from [[Drikung Chetsang]] Rinpoche, because to have accepted it \"at that time would invite unwarranted suspicions from the India government upon himself.\" According to Dawa Tsering, spokesperson for the administration of Shamar Rinpoche, \"He (Urgyen Trinley Dorje) was confident that this meeting would bring peace in the Kagyu School in general and thus help in flourishing Buddha Dharma. This meeting has created a basis to re-unite all in the Dharma Sangha. Therefore, such an initiative should be appreciated by all.\"\n\nIn 2008 there were numerous speculations that Ogyen Trinley Dorje may become the successor of the Dalai Lama as Tibetan Buddhism's representative (but not as Dalai Lama).<ref>[http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/11/21/asia/22tibet.php  Article: International Herald Tribune: ''Tibetan Buddhism's next leader?'' by Barbara Crossette, April 7, 2008]</ref><ref>[http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/04/07/opinion/edcross.php Article: International Herald Tribune: ''Tibetans in exile debate independence'' by Edward Wong,  November 21, 2008]</ref><ref>[http://www.deseretnews.com/article/1,5143,705266610,00.html Article: Deseret News ''17th Karmapa may succeed Dalai Lama'' by Tim Johnson, Nov. 29, 2008]</ref>\n\nAccording to the message of International Karma Kagyu Buddhist Organization published on www.karmapa-issue.org: \"To underscore his willingness to be supportive, Shamar Rinpoche even provided the necessary help for Ugyen Trinlay Dorje to obtain Indian government's approval for his recent visit to the U.S., though at the same time maintaining the stance that Thrinlay Thaye Dorje is the traditional Karmapa.\"<ref>[http://www.karmapa-issue.org/ikkbo/20080523-ikkbo.pdf Message of IKKBO by K.

Shamarpa wrote, \"Although this matter is not easily resolved, since it is connected to the politics of China and India as well, with His Holiness Dalai Lama's blessing and support I am confident that there will be an amicable solution, which will be beneficial for the Karma Kagy\u00fc lineage, as well as for Tibetan Buddhism in general.\" <ref>[http://www.karmapa.org/ Official website of HH The 17th Karmapa Trinley Thaye Dorje]</ref>\n\nIn February 2011, Ogyen Trinley Dorje was accused of being a Chinese spy by officials of the government of the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh,<ref>[http://karmapafactvsfiction.com/l]{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> due in part to the fact that $1 million cash was found in his monastery, part of it in Chinese yuan.

Both have already been enthroned as 17th Karmapa, and both independently have been performing ceremonial duties in the role of a Karmapa. [[Geoffrey Samuel]], an academic expert in the field testified in court, while the recognition of Ogyen Trinley \"appears to have been accepted by a majority of Karma Kagyu monasteries and lamas, there remains a substantial minority of monasteries and lamas who have not accepted Ogyen Trinley as Karmapa. In particular, these include the [[Shamar Rinpoche]], who historically has been the person most directly involved in the process of recognition.\"<ref>https://karmapaissue.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/affirm-geoffrey-samuel.pdf</ref> It is difficult to produce an objective description of the events because the most important developments are known only from conflicting accounts by those involved.\n\nThe Karmapa [[Lineage (Buddhism)|lineage]] is the most ancient [[tulku]] lineage in Tibetan Buddhism, predating the [[Dalai Lama]] lineage by more than two centuries. The lineage is an important one as the Karmapa is traditionally the head of the Karma Kagyu school.\n\nIn October 2018, after many years of discussion, both Karmapa claimants finally met in a rural location in France and issued a joint statement, urging their followers to join in efforts to help preserve the Karma Kagyu tradition.<ref>https://tricycle.org/trikedaily/karmapas-meet/</ref> In 2020, the two candidates announced a plan to move beyond politics and work together to identify the next reincarnation of the [[14th Shamarpa, Mipham Chokyi Lodro]].<ref>https://tricycle.org/trikedaily/karmapas-work-together/</ref> \n\n==Background==\n\n===Recognition of the Karmapa===\nAs with any other lineage of tulkus, the question of recognizing the new [[Rebirth (Buddhist)|incarnation]] is crucial. Sometimes, all concerned parties are sure that a particular child is indeed the new incarnation of that particular master. Such agreement was not the case with the 8th, 10th, and 12th Karmapas (each of which was resolved).<ref>[http://www.rinpoche.com/controversy.htm The Karmapa Controversy]</ref> A dispute has happened again in the case of the 17th Karmapa.\n\n[[Karmapa]]s have often been self-recognizing. That means that many incarnations (at least seven out of sixteen)<ref>Khenpo Ch\u00f6drag Tenphel Rinpoche at the International Karma-Kagy\u00fc-Conference 28th March 1996, Buddhismus Heute Nr. 20, 1996.</ref> claimed very early in life to be Karmapa, recognizing associates and colleagues of the previous incarnation. Also, each Karmapa has left indications leading to his next rebirth, often in the form of a letter. In such letters, indications regarding the location and parentage of the next incarnation were included, though usually in a poetic form that is difficult to decipher. However, the closest associates of the previous incarnation play a crucial role in the process of recognizing the next Karmapa. After all, it is they who have been closely associated with the previous incarnation and will have to raise and teach the new one.\n\nThe process of recognition has involved several different lamas since the first recognition in the early 13th century. Geoffrey Samuel writes that, \"From the late 14th century onwards until the 1790s, the primary responsibility for recognising and enthroning the Karmapa normally belong to the Shamarpa.\"<ref name=\"samuel\">[http://www.karmapa.org.nz/articles/2005/geoffreysamuel.pdf Affirmation of Geoffrey Brian Samuel in Reply] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051022080341/http://karmapa.org.nz/articles/2005/geoffreysamuel.pdf |date=2005-10-22 }}, Affirmed 11 November 2004. pp. 17-18. Statement of Professor Geoffrey Samuel, submitted as part of a court case in Australia. Samuel cites his source as Douglas and White, ''The Black Hat Lama of Tibet'', 1976: 31-110, which summarises information primarily from the Tibetan text ''zla wa chu shel gyi phreng ba''</ref> The 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Karmapas were recognised by individual followers of the early Karmapas, rather than by any tulku. The [[Shamarpa]] recognised the 5th, 6th, 9th (together with Tai Situ), 10th, 11th, and (via a search party) 12th Karmapas. Tai Situ recognised the 8th, 9th (together with the Shamarpa), 14th, and (together with [[Jamgon Kongtrul]]) 16th Karmapas. [[Goshir Gyaltsab|Gyaltsab]] Rinpoche recognised the 7th and 13th Karmapas, and the 15th Karmapa was recognised by the 9th [[Gyalwang Drukpa]] of the [[Drukpa Kagyu]].<ref name=\"samuel\"/>\n\nIn the 1790s, shortly before the recognition of the 14th Karmapa, the Tibetan government in Lhasa banned the Shamarpa from reincarnating as a result of alleged political intrigues. The Karmapa continued to recognize reincarnations of the Shamarpa, but they of necessity lived in secret and were not available to recognise the Karmapas. This ban became irrelevant when the Dalai Lama and the Karmapa both fled Tibet in the late 1950s. The ban was formally lifted in 1963.\n\nSamuel points out that, in the cases of the 7th and 13th Karmapas, the Shamarpa of that time had died at around the same time as the previous Karmapa, meaning that there was no adult Shamarpa available to take part in the recognition. Thus, Samuel argues that \"the only real exception\" to the Shamarpa's preeminent role, prior to his banning, was in the recognition of the 8th Karmapa in 1506.<ref name=\"samuel\"/> Tai Situ has been the next most actively involved in recognising Karmapas, including two of the three recognised between 1790 and 1963.\n\n==Split recognition of the current Karmapa==\nOf the two 17th Karmapas, Ogyen Trinley Dorje has been recognized by [[Situ Rinpoche]] and [[Gyaltsab Rinpoche]]. In July 1992, both asked the Office of the Dalai Lama in Dharamsala to confirm their recognition. The [[Tenzin Gyatso|14th Dalai Lama]] confirmed the recognition of Ogyen Trinley Dorje. His recognition of Ogyen Trinley Dorje as the Karmapa is, in part, attributed to a dream he had of Ogyen Trinley Dorje's birthplace. As stated by the Dalai Lama, in this dream he saw a valley at a higher latitude with multiple streams and other features. Then, in the dream, a voice with no form or body said that this was the place the Karmapa was born.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aodarzRu7zc \"Dalai Lama's Prophetic Dream About the Karmapa's Rebirth\"]</ref>\n\nOther major teachers of the Karma Kagyu lineage (e.g. the 7th [[Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche]], the 9th [[Thrangu Rinpoche]], the 7th [[Mingyur Rinpoche]], and the 9th [[Traleg Kyabgon Rinpoche]]) also hold Ogyen Trinley Dorje to be the 17th Karmapa.\n\nFor the government of the [[People's Republic of China]], Ogyen Trinley Dorje is the 17th Karmapa.<ref>[http://factsanddetails.com/china.php?itemid=1038&catid=6&subcatid=33 KARMAPA LAMA] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101215082736/http://factsanddetails.com/china.php?itemid=1038&catid=6&subcatid=33 |date=2010-12-15 }} - China Facts and Details</ref>\n\nThe first born Karmapa, Trinley Thaye Dorje, has been recognized by [[Mipham Chokyi Lodro|Shamar Rinpoche]] (regarded by some as the senior lama in the Karma Kagyu hierarchy just below the Karmapa), Lama Jigme Rinpoche,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jigmela.org/biography.htm |title=Lama Jigme Rinpoche |publisher=Dhagpo Kagyu Ling |accessdate=27 June 2012}}</ref> Topga Yulgyal Rinpoche, Lopon Tsechu Rinpoche, Sherab Gyaltsen Rinpoche, the Venerable Khenchen Rinpoche Drupon Trinley Paljor, and the Fourth Trungram Gyaltrul Rinpoche.\n\n[[Second Beru Khyentse|Beru Khyentse Rinpoche]] holds a distinct minority view, saying he believes both Karmapas are legitimate.<ref>[http://www.rigpedorje.com/index.php?module=pagemaster&PAGE_user_op=view_page&PAGE_id=11&MMN_position=19:18 Letter to International Dharma Community Nov 03 - Kagyu Rime Dharjay Choling<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223132820/http://www.rigpedorje.com/index.php?module=pagemaster&PAGE_user_op=view_page&PAGE_id=11&MMN_position=19:18 |date=2007-02-23 }}</ref> He states \"it is possible that there can be two Karmapas in order to benefit sentient beings because the Karmapa can manifest in many different forms\" and writes that the 14th Karmapa highlighted that \"in many universes a hundred million Karmapas have manifested.

At age seven, he was formally enthroned at [[Tsurphu Monastery]], the traditional seat of the Karmapas in Tibet. In late December 1999, he eluded his communist Chinese minders, who prevented him from undertaking most of his traditional studies and teaching activities,{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} and escaped over the [[Himalaya]] mountains to exile in [[India]]. He celebrated his twenty-first birthday on June 26, 2006. He has since 2002 hosted and lectured in the Kagyu Monlam Chemno,<ref>[http://www.kagyumonlam.org Kagyu Monlam Chemno website]</ref> a major prayer activities gathering held in Bodhgaya every year end in which major Kagyu masters and lamas participate.\n\n===Circumstances leading to candidacy===\nAfter the death of the 16th Karmapa, Shamar Rinpoche, Tai Situ Rinpoche, Jamgon Kongtrul Rinpoche, and Goshir Gyaltsab Rinpoche agreed to form a council of regents to take joint responsibility for the spiritual affairs of the Karma Kagyu lineage, alternating as the regent for the Karmapa every three years. This regency was, however, dissolved by mutual consent in 1984 having only functioned for three years after the 16th Karmapa's death.\n\nSupporters of Ogyen Trinley Dorje claim that his birth and parentage are consistent with the prediction by [[Chogyur Lingpa]], who, it is claimed, had prophetic visions of various events in the lives of the 14th through the 16th Karmapas. Many believe that Lingpa's statement that the minds of [[Tai Situpa]] and Karmapa \"are inseparably joined as one\" refers to the 17th Karmapa and the current Tai Situ Rinpoche. \"The description ... is meant to show there is disagreement in this reincarnation and the mind of the 17th Karmapa and the mind of Tai Situ Rinpoche are inseparable from each other,\" explains the Kagyu Lama [[Thrangu Rinpoche]], who is one of Ogyen Trinley Dorje's tutors. Although according to Thrangu Rinpoche the 16th Karmapa left two letters specifying a rebirth in Tibet, it is yet another prediction document, hidden in a locket and given to Tai Situpa, that has prompted criticism from the rival claimant's camp.\n\nIn January 1981, nine months before his death, the 12th Tai Situpa claims that the 16th Karmapa gave him an amulet with a yellow brocade cover, telling him, \"This is your protection amulet. In the future, it will confer great benefit.\"  Although Tai Situpa wore the locket on a gold chain for about a year after the Karmapa's death, he moved it to a side pocket, not realizing its significance or that it contained a message. Tai Situpa claims that he followed an intuition to open the amulet in 1989 and found the third prediction letter, inside an envelope marked \"Open in the Metal Horse Year.\" This letter said that the Karmapa was to be reborn \"to the north, in the east of the land of snow,\" and when interpreted at the March 1992 meeting of the council of the four regents, was taken to mean that he would be reborn in a specific valley in eastern Tibet. The letter is reproduced on the Kagyu Office website,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.kagyuoffice.org/karmapa.reference.recognition.predictionletter.html |title=The Sacred Letter of Prediction of HH the 16th Gyalwang Karmapa - Biographical Background Information - the Karmapa website<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2004-09-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041011213358/http://www.kagyuoffice.org/karmapa.reference.recognition.predictionletter.html |archive-date=2004-10-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and reads in part:\n\n<blockquote>\n''From here to the north'' [in] ''the east of'' [the Land of] ''Snow''\n''Is a country where divine thunder spontaneously blazes.''\n[In] ''a beautiful nomad's place with the sign of a cow,''\n''The method is D\u00f6ndrub and the wisdom is Lolaga.''\n[Born in] ''the year of the one used for the earth''\n[With] ''the miraculous, far-reaching sound of the white one:''\n[This] ''is the one known as Karmapa.''\n</blockquote>\n\nOgyen Trinley Dorje's mother's name is ''Loga''; his father's name is Karma ''D\u00f6ndrub'' Tashi, a name given to him by the 16th Karmapa. Both of Ogyen Trinley Dorje's parents' names were similar to the names in the letter produced by Tai Situpa. According to Michele Martin, the letter was interpreted to mean he would be \"born ... in the area of Lhathok, which translates as 'divine (''lha'') thunder (''thog'').' The name of the remote nomadic community where Ogyen Trinley Dorje was born is Bagor, of which ''ba'' means 'cow.' The next line indicates his parents, where the masculine principle ''method'' refers to his father ''D\u00f6ndrub'', and the feminine principle ''wisdom'' refers to his mother ''Lolaga.'' ''The one used for the earth'' points to an animal that plows, and Ogyen Trinley Dorje was born in the year of the Wood Ox (1985). ''The far-reaching sound of the white one'' indicates the sound of the conch shell that is said to have miraculously resounded in the sky for hours after Ogyen Trinley's birth.\"<ref>''Music in the Sky: The Life, Art, and Teaching of the 17th Karmapa Ogyen Trinley Dorje'', Michele Martin.

His father is Jamgon Mipham Rinpoche, the reincarnation of a very important [[lama]] of the [[Nyingma]] school.\n\nAt age eleven, he was formally enthroned at the Karmapa International Buddhist Institute in New Delhi.\n\n===Circumstances leading to candidacy===\nIn October 1986 Chobgye Tri Rinpoche, senior Sakya master and head of one of the three Sakya lineages, contacted the [[Shamarpa]] and informed him about a dream he had had and about a relative of his from Lhasa who brought a picture of a child who reportedly and repeatedly  announced that he was the Karmapa. In 1988 [[Lopon Tsechu Rinpoche]] was sent to obtain more information about the child.\n\nLater an unnamed lama was sent to meet with the family and the boy without revealing the real purpose of his visit. Upon meeting with the emissary the boy promptly said \"You were sent here for me.\" This along with other evidence convinced the Shamarpa that the boy was indeed the reincarnation of the late 16th Karmapa.\n\nIn March 1994, Thaye Dorje escaped with his family from Tibet and travelled to [[New Delhi]] where he was formally recognized during a welcoming ceremony. He took monastic ordination from Chobgye Tri Rinpoche and is at present undergoing a very intensive education under the guidance of Shamar Rinpoche, also studying under teachers such as Prof. Sempa Dorje, Khenpo Ch\u00f6drak Rinpoche and others. Fluent in English, he also travels extensively in the East and the West to give lectures.\n\nThaye Dorje's supporters claim that the Shamarpa is fully authorised to recognise the Karmapa, and therefore no additional recognition is required or even valid.\n\nKarma Pakshi, the 2nd Karmapa, predicted \"future Karmapas shall manifest in two Nirmanakaya forms.\" The 3rd Karmapa recognized the 1st Shamarpa as the fulfillment of this prophecy, giving the Shamar incarnates a special relationship with the Karmapas. This is supported among others by old Kagyu literature where one frequently finds the expression of the 2 Karmapas, black and red hat. Also, when referring to former reincarnation of the Shamarpa, these are often called Karmapa and can only differentiated from former Karmapa reincarnations by their name.\n\nAlthough followers{{according to whom|date=July 2017}} of Ogyen Trinley Dorje point out that he was the only candidate ''enthroned'' in Tibet, both claimants were born in Tibet[''[[wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch#Unsupported%20attributions|according to whom?]]''] and so the prediction about the return to Tibet within these two letters is fulfilled by both claimants.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nThe 16th Karmapa clearly denominated Shamarpa as \"sovereign\" of the lineage when he wrote in 1964:{{original research inline|date=July 2017}}\n\n:\"The most exalted, the lord of the lands of snow is Avalokite\u015bvara.\n:The coalescence of his essence is the glorious Karmapa. \n:Inseparable from his three mysteries, in the manner of the three lords,\n:Is his manifestation, the great emanation; the majestic sun,\n:Whom I invest now sovereign of the practice lineage's order.\n:By the power of scattering auspicious flowers of excellent virtue \n:Combined with the true words of the \u1e5bi\u1e63hi's truthfulness \n:May he successfully and everlastingly be the sovereign of the order.\" <ref>Longlife prayer for Shamarpa, included in the collected writings of the 16th Karmapa (sung bum), cit. in: {{cite web|url=http://www.karmatrinlay.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/KTRs-tribute-to-Shamarpa.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160109090605/http://www.karmatrinlay.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/KTRs-tribute-to-Shamarpa.pdf |archivedate=2016-01-09 }}</ref>\n\n==Recent developments==\n[[Image:Rumtek monastery.jpg|220px|right|thumb|Rumtek Monastery]]\nControl of [[Rumtek Monastery]], which was the seat of the 16th Karmapa in exile, has been the subject of a legal contest. In 1961 the 16th Karmapa established the '''Karmapa Charitable Trust'''. Ogyen Trinley's followers claimed that the trust was solely established for the sake of seeing to the welfare of the Karmapa's followers, providing funds for the maintenance of the monastery, and for the monks' medical fees, but that administration of the monastery was the responsibility of the Tsurphu Labrang.

Ogyen Trinley Dorje had mentioned his desire to meet the Shamarpa, and requested [[Ch\u00f6kyi Nyima Rinpoche]] arrange a personal meeting with him. The Shamarpa had declined the first invitation in 2005, which was received by telephone call from [[Drikung Chetsang]] Rinpoche, because to have accepted it \"at that time would invite unwarranted suspicions from the India government upon himself.\" According to Dawa Tsering, spokesperson for the administration of Shamar Rinpoche, \"He (Urgyen Trinley Dorje) was confident that this meeting would bring peace in the Kagyu School in general and thus help in flourishing Buddha Dharma. This meeting has created a basis to re-unite all in the Dharma Sangha. Therefore, such an initiative should be appreciated by all.\"\n\nIn 2008 there were numerous speculations that Ogyen Trinley Dorje may become the successor of the Dalai Lama as Tibetan Buddhism's representative (but not as Dalai Lama).<ref>[http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/11/21/asia/22tibet.php  Article: International Herald Tribune: ''Tibetan Buddhism's next leader?'' by Barbara Crossette, April 7, 2008]</ref><ref>[http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/04/07/opinion/edcross.php Article: International Herald Tribune: ''Tibetans in exile debate independence'' by Edward Wong,  November 21, 2008]</ref><ref>[http://www.deseretnews.com/article/1,5143,705266610,00.html Article: Deseret News ''17th Karmapa may succeed Dalai Lama'' by Tim Johnson, Nov. 29, 2008]</ref>\n\nAccording to the message of International Karma Kagyu Buddhist Organization published on www.karmapa-issue.org: \"To underscore his willingness to be supportive, Shamar Rinpoche even provided the necessary help for Ugyen Trinlay Dorje to obtain Indian government's approval for his recent visit to the U.S., though at the same time maintaining the stance that Thrinlay Thaye Dorje is the traditional Karmapa.\"<ref>[http://www.karmapa-issue.org/ikkbo/20080523-ikkbo.pdf Message of IKKBO by K.

Shamarpa wrote, \"Although this matter is not easily resolved, since it is connected to the politics of China and India as well, with His Holiness Dalai Lama's blessing and support I am confident that there will be an amicable solution, which will be beneficial for the Karma Kagy\u00fc lineage, as well as for Tibetan Buddhism in general.\" <ref>[http://www.karmapa.org/ Official website of HH The 17th Karmapa Trinley Thaye Dorje]</ref>\n\nIn February 2011, Ogyen Trinley Dorje was accused of being a Chinese spy by officials of the government of the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh,<ref>[http://karmapafactvsfiction.com/l]{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> due in part to the fact that $1 million cash was found in his monastery, part of it in Chinese yuan.
