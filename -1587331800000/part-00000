The symbol in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] that represents this sound is {{angbr IPA|\u03b2}}, and the equivalent [[X-SAMPA]] symbol is <code>B</code>. The symbol {{angbr IPA|\u03b2}} is the [[Greek alphabet|Greek letter]] [[beta (letter)|beta]]. \n\nThis letter is also often used to represent the bilabial [[Approximant consonant|approximant]], though that is more clearly written with a lowering diacritic, that is {{angbr IPA|\u03b2\u031e}}. Theoretically, it could also be transcribed as an advanced [[labiodental approximant]] {{angbr IPA|\u028b\u031f}}, but this symbol is hardly ever, if at all, used so. It has been proposed that either a turned \u27e8<span style=\"{{Transform-rotate|180}}\">{{IPA|\u03b2}}</span>\u27e9 or reversed \u27e8<span style=\"{{mirrorH}}\">{{IPA|\u03b2}}</span>\u27e9 be used as a dedicated symbol for the bilabial approximant, but despite occasional usage this has not gained general acceptance.<ref>See for example {{cite journal\n|last1=Ball\n|first1=Martin J.\n|authorlink1=Martin J.

The [[Mapos Buang language]] of New Guinea contains this contrast.

'''voiced bilabial fricative''' is a type of [[consonant]]al sound, used in some [[Speech communication|spoken]] [[language]]s. The symbol in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] that represents this sound is {{angbr IPA|\u03b2}}, and the equivalent [[X-SAMPA]] symbol is <code>B</code>. The symbol {{angbr IPA|\u03b2}} is the [[Greek alphabet|Greek letter]] [[beta (letter)|beta]]. \n\nThis letter is also often used to represent the bilabial [[Approximant consonant|approximant]], though that is more clearly written with a lowering diacritic, that is {{angbr IPA|\u03b2\u031e}}. Theoretically, it could also be transcribed as an advanced [[labiodental approximant]] {{angbr IPA|\u028b\u031f}}, but this symbol is hardly ever, if at all, used so. It has been proposed that either a turned \u27e8<span style=\"{{Transform-rotate|180}}\">{{IPA|\u03b2}}</span>\u27e9 or reversed \u27e8<span style=\"{{mirrorH}}\">{{IPA|\u03b2}}</span>\u27e9 be used as a dedicated symbol for the bilabial approximant, but despite occasional usage this has not gained general acceptance.<ref>See for example {{cite journal\n|last1=Ball\n|first1=Martin J.\n|authorlink1=Martin J.

It was re-released in 1992 \u2013 with a different B-side and now credited to \"Tears For Fears featuring Oleta Adams\" \u2013 to capitalise on the singer's solo success and to promote the Tears for Fears compilation ''[[Tears Roll Down (Greatest Hits 82\u201392)]]''. This time, it reached number 57 in the UK.\n\n==Content==\n\"Woman in Chains\" was recorded as a duet. Orzabal explained the impetus for the lyric to ''[[Melody Maker]]'': \"I was reading some feminist literature at the time and I discovered that there are societies in the world still in existence today that are non-patriarchal. They don't have the man at the top and the women at the bottom. They're matricentric\u2014they have the woman at the centre and these societies are a lot less violent, a lot less greedy and there's generally less animosity... but the song is also about how men traditionally play down the feminine side of their characters and how both men and women suffer for it.... I think men in a patriarchal society are sold down the river a bit\u2014okay, maybe we're told that we're in control but there are also a hell of a lot of things that we miss out on, which women are allowed to be\".\n\nThe song was sampled in the S.A.S. single \"So Free\" featuring [[Cam'ron]] and on ''Uneasy Listening Vol. 1'' by [[DJ Z-Trip]] and [[DJ P]].

It was re-released in 1992 \u2013 with a different B-side and now credited to \"Tears For Fears featuring Oleta Adams\" \u2013 to capitalise on the singer's solo success and to promote the Tears for Fears compilation ''[[Tears Roll Down (Greatest Hits 82\u201392)]]''. This time, it reached number 57 in the UK.\n\n==Content==\n\"Woman in Chains\" was recorded as a duet. Orzabal explained the impetus for the lyric to ''[[Melody Maker]]'': \"I was reading some feminist literature at the time and I discovered that there are societies in the world still in existence today that are non-patriarchal. They don't have the man at the top and the women at the bottom. They're matricentric\u2014they have the woman at the centre and these societies are a lot less violent, a lot less greedy and there's generally less animosity... but the song is also about how men traditionally play down the feminine side of their characters and how both men and women suffer for it.... I think men in a patriarchal society are sold down the river a bit\u2014okay, maybe we're told that we're in control but there are also a hell of a lot of things that we miss out on, which women are allowed to be\".\n\nThe song was sampled in the S.A.S. single \"So Free\" featuring [[Cam'ron]] and on ''Uneasy Listening Vol. 1'' by [[DJ Z-Trip]] and [[DJ P]]. It also appears on the soundtrack of the 1993 film ''[[Boxing Helena]]''.\n\n== Music video ==\n\nThe video, directed by [[Andy Morahan]],<ref name=\"mvdbase\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mvdbase.com/video.php?id=27530|title=mvdbase.com -  Tears For Fears - \"Woman in chains\"|work=Music Video DataBase|last=Garcia|first=Alex S|accessdate=1 November 2015}}</ref> was filmed in black and white.

It was developed by [[Eurocom]] and published by [[Electronic Arts]] in conjunction with [[Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment]] and DC Comics. It was released on [[Game Boy Advance]], [[GameCube]], [[PlayStation 2]] and [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]].<ref name=\"officalsite\"/> The film's original cast provided a voice-over reprisal in the game, with the exception of [[Gary Oldman]], who portrays [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]], replaced by Gavin Hammon.\n\nA [[PlayStation Portable]] version of the game was planned, but subsequently canceled.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/games/batman-begins/psp-710796|title=Batman Begins (PlayStation Portable)|publisher=|accessdate=January 2, 2017}}</ref> A sequel, ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight (video game)|Batman: The Dark Knight]]'', was developed for the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]] but later canceled.<ref name=\"IBTimesCancelled\">{{cite web|last1=Skipper|first1=Ben|title=Cancelled Batman game: Unseen 64 tells story of Pandemic's The Dark Knight movie tie-in|url=https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/cancelled-batman-game-unseen-64-tells-story-pandemics-dark-knight-movie-tie-1541178|website=[[International Business Times]]|accessdate=May 12, 2018|date=February 1, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe game has a unique system involving intimidation. ''Batman Begins'' features the utilization of the environment to frighten opponents, which may cause them to drop their weapons. Certain gadgets designed to frighten enemies during combat are provided, such as smoke grenades, flash bang grenades, and an 'HF Transponder', which summons bats to gather around and incapacitate enemies with fear. On top of this is traditional stealth gameplay reminiscent of the ''[[Splinter Cell]]'' series, such as sneaking. There are many ways to incapacitate enemies with stealth, using various combat and martial arts techniques. The game also includes combat racing sections where the player can drive the [[Batmobile]].\n\n==Story==\nThe game follows the movie's plot very closely, with minor modifications. Throughout the game there are over 20 clips from the film that give context to the story. Though it follows the movie, the game goes deeper into each scene. For example, at the docks, the player learns specifically how Falcone was hoisted on a crane and how Batman infiltrated [[Arkham Asylum]]. It also presents a slightly alternate ending; Batman is forced to detonate the [[Batmobile]] in order to destroy the monorail tracks and stop Ra's Al Ghul from reaching Wayne Tower with the Microwave Emitter, whereas in the film, [[James Gordon (comics)|Sergeant Gordon]] uses the Batmobile's missiles to destroy the tracks. Two members of the film's crew make cameo appearances in the game; [[Wally Pfister]], the film's director of photography, appears as a mob informant Batman interrogates, and [[Emma Thomas]], producer of the film, appears as an Arkham psychologist. The only scene in the game that is not taken from the film is a second car chase with the Tumbler in which Batman attempts and fails to stop the theft of the microwave emitter that Ra's Al Ghul will use in his attack on Gotham.\n\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n| width = 26m\n| GR = (Xbox) 67.20%<ref name=GRXBOX>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/xbox/925112-batman-begins/index.html|title=Batman Begins for Xbox|publisher=GameRankings|accessdate=2013-11-22}}</ref><br />(GC) 66.74%<ref name=GRGC>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/gamecube/925114-batman-begins/index.html|title=Batman Begins for GameCube|publisher=GameRankings|accessdate=2013-11-22}}</ref><br />(PS2) 65.63%<ref name=GRPS2>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/ps2/925115-batman-begins/index.html|title=Batman Begins for PlayStation 2|publisher=GameRankings|accessdate=2013-11-22}}</ref><br />(GBA) 62.14%<ref name=GRGBA>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/gba/925117-batman-begins/index.html|title=Batman Begins for Game Boy Advance|publisher=[[GameRankings]]|accessdate=2013-11-22}}</ref>\n| MC = (GC) 66/100<ref name=MCGC>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/gamecube/batman-begins|title=Batman Begins for GameCube Reviews|website=Metacritic|accessdate=2013-11-22}}</ref><br />(Xbox) 65/100<ref name=MCXBOX>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox/batman-begins|title=Batman Begins for Xbox Reviews|website=Metacritic|accessdate=2013-11-22}}</ref><br />(PS2) 64/100<ref name=MCPS2>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-2/batman-begins|title=Batman Begins for PlayStation 2 Reviews|website=Metacritic|accessdate=2013-11-22}}</ref><br />(GBA) 61/100<ref name=MCGBA>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/game-boy-advance/batman-begins|title=Batman Begins for Game Boy Advance Reviews|website=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=2013-11-22}}</ref>\n| EGM = 5.33/10<ref name=EGM>{{cite journal|title=Batman Begins|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=195|date=September 2005}}</ref>\n| EuroG = 6/10<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/r_batmanbegins_x|title=Batman Begins Review (Xbox)|last=Bramwell|first=Tom|website=[[Eurogamer]]|date=2005-06-17|accessdate=2013-11-23}}</ref>\n| GI = 7.25/10<ref name=GI>{{cite journal|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/Games/Review/200508/R05.0822.0925.44351.htm|title=Batman Begins|last=Mason|first=Lisa|magazine=[[Game Informer]]|issue=148|date=August 2005|page=97|accessdate=2013-11-23|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051104195506/http://www.gameinformer.com/Games/Review/200508/R05.0822.0925.44351.htm|archivedate=2005-11-04|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n| GamePro = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref name=GamePro>{{cite magazine|url=http://gamepro.com/nintendo/gamecube/games/reviews/50250.shtml|title=Review: Batman Begins|author=Doctor Zombie|magazine=[[GamePro]]|date=2005-12-02|accessdate=2013-11-23|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061016045522/http://gamepro.com/nintendo/gamecube/games/reviews/50250.shtml|archivedate=2006-10-16|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n| GameRev = C<ref name=GameRev>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/batman-begins|title=Batman Begins Review|last=Hurh|first=JP|publisher=[[Game Revolution]]|date=June 2005|accessdate=2013-11-23}}</ref>\n| GSpot = 6.8/10<ref name=GS>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/batman-begins-review/1900-6127749/|title=Batman Begins Review|last=Colayco|first=Bob|website=GameSpot|date=2005-06-17|accessdate=2013-11-22}}</ref><br />(PS2) 6.7/10<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/batman-begins-review/1900-6127750/|title=Batman Begins Review (PS2)|last=Colayco|first=Bob|website=GameSpot|date=2005-06-17|accessdate=2013-11-22}}</ref><br />(GBA) 5/10<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/batman-begins-review/1900-6128632/|title=Batman Begins Review (GBA)|last=Provo|first=Frank|website=[[GameSpot]]|date=2005-07-06|accessdate=2013-11-22}}</ref>\n| GSpy = (Xbox) {{Rating|3.5|5}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://xbox.gamespy.com/xbox/batman-begins/627484p1.html|title=GameSpy: Batman Begins (Xbox)|last=Tuttle|first=Will|publisher=GameSpy|date=2005-06-20|accessdate=2013-11-23}}</ref><br />{{Rating|3|5}}<ref name=GSpy>{{cite web|url=http://cube.gamespy.com/gamecube/batman-begins/627509p1.html|title=GameSpy: Batman Begins|last=Tuttle|first=Will|publisher=[[GameSpy]]|date=2005-06-20|accessdate=2013-11-23}}</ref>\n| GT = 7/10<ref name=GT>{{cite web|url=http://www.gametrailers.com/reviews/9k9ncm/batman-begins-review|title=Batman Begins Review|publisher=[[GameTrailers]]|date=June 23, 2005|accessdate=2013-11-23}}</ref>\n| GameZone = (GC) 7.2/10<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamezone.com/reviews/2005/06/28/batman_begins_gc_review|title=Batman Begins -

''Batman Begins'' features the utilization of the environment to frighten opponents, which may cause them to drop their weapons. Certain gadgets designed to frighten enemies during combat are provided, such as smoke grenades, flash bang grenades, and an 'HF Transponder', which summons bats to gather around and incapacitate enemies with fear. On top of this is traditional stealth gameplay reminiscent of the ''[[Splinter Cell]]'' series, such as sneaking. There are many ways to incapacitate enemies with stealth, using various combat and martial arts techniques. The game also includes combat racing sections where the player can drive the [[Batmobile]].\n\n==Story==\nThe game follows the movie's plot very closely, with minor modifications. Throughout the game there are over 20 clips from the film that give context to the story. Though it follows the movie, the game goes deeper into each scene. For example, at the docks, the player learns specifically how Falcone was hoisted on a crane and how Batman infiltrated [[Arkham Asylum]]. It also presents a slightly alternate ending; Batman is forced to detonate the [[Batmobile]] in order to destroy the monorail tracks and stop Ra's Al Ghul from reaching Wayne Tower with the Microwave Emitter, whereas in the film, [[James Gordon (comics)|Sergeant Gordon]] uses the Batmobile's missiles to destroy the tracks. Two members of the film's crew make cameo appearances in the game; [[Wally Pfister]], the film's director of photography, appears as a mob informant Batman interrogates, and [[Emma Thomas]], producer of the film, appears as an Arkham psychologist. The only scene in the game that is not taken from the film is a second car chase with the Tumbler in which Batman attempts and fails to stop the theft of the microwave emitter that Ra's Al Ghul will use in his attack on Gotham.\n\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n| width = 26m\n| GR = (Xbox) 67.20%<ref name=GRXBOX>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/xbox/925112-batman-begins/index.html|title=Batman Begins for Xbox|publisher=GameRankings|accessdate=2013-11-22}}</ref><br />(GC) 66.74%<ref name=GRGC>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/gamecube/925114-batman-begins/index.html|title=Batman Begins for GameCube|publisher=GameRankings|accessdate=2013-11-22}}</ref><br />(PS2) 65.63%<ref name=GRPS2>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/ps2/925115-batman-begins/index.html|title=Batman Begins for PlayStation 2|publisher=GameRankings|accessdate=2013-11-22}}</ref><br />(GBA) 62.14%<ref name=GRGBA>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/gba/925117-batman-begins/index.html|title=Batman Begins for Game Boy Advance|publisher=[[GameRankings]]|accessdate=2013-11-22}}</ref>\n| MC = (GC) 66/100<ref name=MCGC>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/gamecube/batman-begins|title=Batman Begins for GameCube Reviews|website=Metacritic|accessdate=2013-11-22}}</ref><br />(Xbox) 65/100<ref name=MCXBOX>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox/batman-begins|title=Batman Begins for Xbox Reviews|website=Metacritic|accessdate=2013-11-22}}</ref><br />(PS2) 64/100<ref name=MCPS2>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-2/batman-begins|title=Batman Begins for PlayStation 2 Reviews|website=Metacritic|accessdate=2013-11-22}}</ref><br />(GBA) 61/100<ref name=MCGBA>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/game-boy-advance/batman-begins|title=Batman Begins for Game Boy Advance Reviews|website=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=2013-11-22}}</ref>\n| EGM = 5.33/10<ref name=EGM>{{cite journal|title=Batman Begins|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=195|date=September 2005}}</ref>\n| EuroG = 6/10<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/r_batmanbegins_x|title=Batman Begins Review (Xbox)|last=Bramwell|first=Tom|website=[[Eurogamer]]|date=2005-06-17|accessdate=2013-11-23}}</ref>\n| GI = 7.25/10<ref name=GI>{{cite journal|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/Games/Review/200508/R05.0822.0925.44351.htm|title=Batman Begins|last=Mason|first=Lisa|magazine=[[Game Informer]]|issue=148|date=August 2005|page=97|accessdate=2013-11-23|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051104195506/http://www.gameinformer.com/Games/Review/200508/R05.0822.0925.44351.htm|archivedate=2005-11-04|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n| GamePro = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref name=GamePro>{{cite magazine|url=http://gamepro.com/nintendo/gamecube/games/reviews/50250.shtml|title=Review: Batman Begins|author=Doctor Zombie|magazine=[[GamePro]]|date=2005-12-02|accessdate=2013-11-23|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061016045522/http://gamepro.com/nintendo/gamecube/games/reviews/50250.shtml|archivedate=2006-10-16|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n| GameRev = C<ref name=GameRev>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/batman-begins|title=Batman Begins Review|last=Hurh|first=JP|publisher=[[Game Revolution]]|date=June 2005|accessdate=2013-11-23}}</ref>\n| GSpot = 6.8/10<ref name=GS>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/batman-begins-review/1900-6127749/|title=Batman Begins Review|last=Colayco|first=Bob|website=GameSpot|date=2005-06-17|accessdate=2013-11-22}}</ref><br />(PS2) 6.7/10<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/batman-begins-review/1900-6127750/|title=Batman Begins Review (PS2)|last=Colayco|first=Bob|website=GameSpot|date=2005-06-17|accessdate=2013-11-22}}</ref><br />(GBA) 5/10<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/batman-begins-review/1900-6128632/|title=Batman Begins Review (GBA)|last=Provo|first=Frank|website=[[GameSpot]]|date=2005-07-06|accessdate=2013-11-22}}</ref>\n| GSpy = (Xbox) {{Rating|3.5|5}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://xbox.gamespy.com/xbox/batman-begins/627484p1.html|title=GameSpy: Batman Begins (Xbox)|last=Tuttle|first=Will|publisher=GameSpy|date=2005-06-20|accessdate=2013-11-23}}</ref><br />{{Rating|3|5}}<ref name=GSpy>{{cite web|url=http://cube.gamespy.com/gamecube/batman-begins/627509p1.html|title=GameSpy: Batman Begins|last=Tuttle|first=Will|publisher=[[GameSpy]]|date=2005-06-20|accessdate=2013-11-23}}</ref>\n| GT = 7/10<ref name=GT>{{cite web|url=http://www.gametrailers.com/reviews/9k9ncm/batman-begins-review|title=Batman Begins Review|publisher=[[GameTrailers]]|date=June 23, 2005|accessdate=2013-11-23}}</ref>\n| GameZone = (GC) 7.2/10<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamezone.com/reviews/2005/06/28/batman_begins_gc_review|title=Batman Begins -
