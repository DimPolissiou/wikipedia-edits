During the 1990s, he and brother [[Ben Pappas]] were highly regarded skateboarders on a global scale, reaching the top two places in the world rankings.<ref name=tw/>\n\n==Early life==\nPappas was born in 1975 in [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and grew up in the north-western suburb of [[St Albans, Victoria|St Albans]].<ref name=\"Mad\">{{cite news|author1=Garry Maddox|title=After the fall|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/after-the-fall-20140519-38iou.html|accessdate=9 August 2014|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=24 May 2014}}</ref> He and brother Ben were the only children of a Greek-Australian father, who worked for a finance company, and an Australian mother who was a caterer\u2014the parents eventually separated after marrying at a young age.<ref name=\"Mad\" />\n\nTas Pappas described a chaotic home environment in 2014:\n\n<blockquote>\nThe family was very dysfunctional ... We were hurting as kids from a lot of the fights we saw ... I always felt like I just wanted to get out of where I lived. I wanted to prove myself. I ended up having what felt like a chip on my shoulder because of it all. I just wanted to get to America and become something.<ref name=\"Mad\" /></blockquote>\n\nPappas became fascinated with skateboarding at the age of 12 years after watching touring American professionals perform at the [[Prahran, Victoria|Prahran]] skate park. He then visited the United States (US) for the first time three years later, before relocating to the US at the age of 17 years after he dropped out of Kings Park High School.

Pappas explained that he was \"humbled\" soon afterward, as he subsequently broke his back.<ref name=\"News\" /> Both the Pappas brothers then found that they were unable to gain favour with the American skateboard industry due to their attitudes, which were considered abrasive and wild. Australian filmmaker Eddie Martin, who knew the Pappas brothers as teenagers skateboarding at Prahran skate park, explained in 2014: \"They\u2019re [Pappas brothers] very Australian characters. They were so raw and full of passion. They just went over there and stuck it to them. It just didn\u2019t go down very well.\"<ref name=\"Mail\" />\n\nIn 1999, Pappas' brother Ben was intercepted by law enforcement while attempting to smuggle cocaine into Australia and, in addition to a prison term, his [[passport]] was confiscated for a three-year period and he was unable to continue his skateboarding career in the US.<ref name=\"News\" />\n\n===Revolution Graphite Skateboards (RevDeck)===\nIn 2005, Revolution Graphite Skateboards (RevDeck) announced the release of a new skateboard deck, co-designed and tested by Pappas (he was also [[skateboarding sponsorship|sponsored]] by [[DVS Shoes]] at this time{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}). As of 2014, Pappas is associated with the company, according to the \"About\" section of the website;<ref>{{cite web|title=About Revolution Skateboards|url=http://revdeck.com/pages/About.html|work=Revolution Graphite Skateboards|publisher=Revolution Skateboards|accessdate=23 February 2013|year=2013}}</ref> however, in August 2014, the website's home page stated that the company is manufacturing certain skateboard deck products for a limited period of time.<ref>{{cite web|title=Home|url=http://revdeck.com/|work=Revolution Graphite Skateboards|publisher=Revolution Skateboards|accessdate=23 February 2013|year=2013}}</ref>\n\n===US incarceration===\nIn 2005, Pappas married Colleen, an American he met through skateboarding. They lived in [[San Diego]] with their two children. However, due to financial difficulties, the relationship was strained and Pappas began using [[crystal methamphetamine]], to numb the pain from injuries during contests that he desperately participated in to earn money. Additionally, Pappas was prescribed an antidepressant after he consulted a doctor for help with a low emotional state caused by his life situation\u2014Pappas proceeded to use alcohol and cocaine with the medication.<ref name=\"Mad\" /><ref name=\"News\" />\n\nPappas explained in 2014 that his drug use at the time led to [[paranoia]] about his wife being involved in an extramarital relationship and during an argument he physically assaulted Colleen. Pappas said: \"I was paranoid that she was on with someone ... I don't agree with what I did, but I ended up hitting her and losing the plot and went to jail.\" Pappas' actions resulted in a two-month prison term and he was eventually deported after he was found in a drug-related car crash during his corresponding parole period. While in detention, awaiting to be flown to Australia, Pappas received a telephone call from his father to inform him that Ben Pappas was dead, a moment that Pappas described as \"the saddest thing I've ever heard.\"<ref name=\"Mad\" />\n\n===Australian incarceration===\nFollowing his return to Australia in 2007, Pappas began drinking alcohol heavily and his father died of a heart attack the following year. Also in 2008, Pappas flew to South America in an attempt to procure cocaine to smuggle into Australia so that he could pay off a drug debt. Pappas, who attempted to smuggle the drug in three skateboard decks while intoxicated on [[benzodiazepine]]s, alcohol and amphetamines, was intercepted at Sydney Airport after the traces of cocaine on his clothing alerted authorities. Pappas was consequently [[Incarceration|imprisoned]] for three years in various [[New South Wales]] facilities.<ref name=\"Mad\" />\n\nIn November 2011, Pappas was afforded the privilege of prison day-release on weekends and used this time to skate the [[vert ramp]] in [[Albury, New South Wales]].

An ancestor, Nicholas Wyeth, a stonemason, came to Massachusetts from England in 1645. Later ancestors were prominent participants in the French and Indian Wars, the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, and the American Civil War, passing down rich oral histories and tradition to Wyeth and his family and providing subject matter for his art, which was deeply felt. His maternal ancestors came from Switzerland, and during his childhood, his mother was acquainted with literary giants [[Henry David Thoreau]] and [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]]. His literary appreciation and artistic talents appear to have come from her.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kohler|first1=Sue A.|last2=Carson|first2=Jeffrey R.|title=Sixteenth Street Architecture.

C.|page=204}}</ref>\n\nHe was the oldest of four brothers who spent much time hunting, fishing, and enjoying other outdoor pursuits, and doing chores on their farm. His varied youthful activities and his naturally astute sense of observation later aided the authenticity of his illustrations and obviated the need for models: \"When I paint a figure on horseback, a man plowing, or a woman buffeted by the wind, I have an acute sense of the muscle strain.\"<ref>''An American Vision: Three Generations of Wyeth Art'', Little Brown and Company, Boston, 1987, {{ISBN|0-8212-1652-X}}, p. 4</ref>\n\nHis mother encouraged his early inclination toward art. Wyeth was doing excellent watercolor paintings by the age of twelve.<ref>''An American Vision'', p. 78</ref> He went to Mechanics Arts School to learn drafting, and then Massachusetts Normal Art School, now [[Massachusetts College of Art and Design]], where painting instructor Richard Andrew advised him to become an illustrator,  and then the [[Eric Pape]] School of Art to learn illustration, under [[George Loftus Noyes]] and Charles W.

In 1904, the same magazine commissioned him to illustrate a Western story, and Pyle urged Wyeth to go West to acquire direct knowledge, much as [[Zane Grey]] had done for his Western novels. In Colorado, he worked as a cowboy alongside the professional \"punchers\", moving cattle and doing ranch chores. He visited the [[Navajo people|Navajo]] in Arizona and gained an understanding of Native American culture. When his money was stolen, he worked as a mail carrier, riding between the Two Grey Hills trading post and Fort Defiance, to earn enough to get back home. He wrote home, \"The life is wonderful, strange\u2014the fascination of it clutches me like some unseen animal\u2014it seems to whisper, 'Come back, you belong here, this is your real home.'\"<ref>''An American Vision'', p. 12</ref>\n\nOn a second trip two years later, he collected information on mining and brought home costumes and artifacts, including cowboy and Indian clothing. His early trips to the western United States inspired a period of images of [[cowboy]]s and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] that dramatized the [[American Old West|Old West]].<ref name=barewalls />\n\nUpon returning to Chadds Ford, he painted a series of farm scenes for ''[[Charles Scribner's Sons|Scribner's]]'', finding the landscape less dramatic than that of the West but nonetheless a rich environment for his art: \"Everything lies in its subtleties, everything is so gentle and simple, so unaffected.\"<ref>''An American Vision'', p. 16</ref> His painting ''Mowing'' (1907), not done for illustration, was among his most successful images of rural life.\n\nWyeth created a stimulating household for his talented children [[Andrew Wyeth]], [[Henriette Wyeth|Henriette Wyeth Hurd]], [[Carolyn Wyeth]], [[Ann Wyeth McCoy]], and [[Nathaniel Wyeth (inventor)|Nathaniel C. Wyeth]]. Wyeth was very sociable, and frequent visitors included [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]], [[Joseph Hergesheimer]], [[Hugh Walpole]], [[Lillian Gish]], and [[John Gilbert (actor)|John Gilbert]]. According to Andrew, who spent the most time with his father due to his sickly childhood, Wyeth was a strict but patient father who did not talk down to his children.<ref>An American Vision, p. 78</ref> His hard work as an illustrator gave his family the financial freedom to follow their own artistic and scientific pursuits. Andrew went on to become one of the foremost American artists of the second half of the 20th century, and both Henriette and Carolyn became artists also; Ann became an artist and composer. Nathaniel became an engineer for [[DuPont]] and worked on the team that invented the plastic soda bottle. Henriette and Ann married two of Wyeth's prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, [[Peter Hurd]] and [[John W. McCoy]]. Wyeth is the grandfather of artists [[Jamie Wyeth]] and Michael Hurd, and the musician [[Howard Wyeth]].<ref name=Fisk>{{cite web| author= Fisk, Dean| title= FISKE-L: Re-Nicholas Wyeth / John Fiske & Sara Wyeth| date= August 5, 1998| url= http://archiver.rootsweb.com/th/read/FISKE/1998-08/0902302187| accessdate= February 19, 2007| archive-url= https://archive.is/20130104151958/http://archiver.rootsweb.com/th/read/FISKE/1998-08/0902302187| archive-date= January 4, 2013| url-status= dead}}</ref>\n\nBy 1911, Wyeth began to move away from Western subjects and on to illustrating classic literature. He painted a series for an edition of ''[[Treasure Island]]'' (1911), by [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], thought by many to be his finest group of illustrations. The set made him famous, and the proceeds from this great success paid for his house and studio.<ref>''An American Vision'', p. 29</ref> He also illustrated editions of ''[[Kidnapped (book)|Kidnapped]]'' (1913), ''[[Robin Hood]]'' (1917), ''[[The Last of the Mohicans]]'' (1919), ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'' (1920), ''[[Rip Van Winkle]]'' (1921), ''[[The White Company]]'' (1922), and ''[[The Yearling]]'' (1939). He did work for prominent periodicals, including ''[[The Century Magazine|Century]]'', ''[[Harper's Monthly]]'', ''[[Ladies' Home Journal]]'', ''[[McClure's]]'', ''[[Outing]]'', ''[[The Popular Magazine]]'', and [[Charles Scribner's Sons|Scribner's]].\n\nBy 1914, Wyeth loathed the commercialism upon which he became dependent, and for the rest of his life he battled internally over his capitulation, accusing himself of having \"bitched myself with the accursed success in skin-deep pictures and illustrations\".  He complained of money men \"who want to buy me piecemeal\" and that \"an illustration must be made practical, not only in its dramatic statement, but it must be a thing that will adapt itself to the engravers' and printers' limitations. This fact alone kills that underlying inspiration to create thought. Instead of expressing that inner feeling, you express the outward thought\u2026 or imitation of that feeling.\"<ref>''An American Vision'', p. 18</ref>\n\nWyeth also did posters, calendars, and advertisements for clients such as [[Lucky Strike]], [[Cream of Wheat]], and [[Coca-Cola]], as well as paintings of Beethoven, Wagner, and Liszt for [[Steinway & Sons]]. He painted murals of historical and allegorical subjects for the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, the Westtown School, the First National Bank of Boston, the Hotel Roosevelt, the Franklin Savings Bank, the National Geographic Society, the Wilmington Savings Fund Society, and other public and private buildings. During both World Wars, he contributed patriotic images to government and private agencies.<ref>Chenoweth, H. Avery.

Wyeth was a member of  [[The Franklin Inn Club]] in Philadelphia.\n\n[[File:Self-portrait by N. C. Wyeth, 1940, National Academy of Design.JPG|thumb|right|''Self-portrait'' by N. C. Wyeth, 1940]]\nHis nonillustrative portrait and landscape paintings changed dramatically in style throughout his life as he experimented first with impressionism in the 1910s (feeling an affinity with the nearby \"New Hope Group\"), the principles of the divisionist painter [[Giovanni Segantini]], then by the 1930s veering to the realistic American regionalism of [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]] and [[Grant Wood]], painting with thin oils and, occasionally, egg tempera. That was the medium favored by his son, Andrew, and introduced to both of them by his son-in-law Peter Hurd. Wyeth worked rapidly and experimented constantly, often working on a larger scale than necessary, befitting his energetic and grand vision, which often harked back to his ancestral past. He could conceive, sketch out, and paint a large painting in as little as three hours.<ref>''An American Vision'', p. 80</ref>\n\n==Death and legacy==\nIn June 1945, he had received the honorary degree of master of arts from [[Bowdoin College]]. Wyeth was a member of the National Academy, the Society of Illustrators, the Philadelphia Water Color Club, the Fellowship of the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]], the Philadelphia Art Alliance, the Chester County Art Association, and the [[Wilmington Society of the Fine Arts]]. {{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\nIn October 1945, Wyeth and his grandson (Nathaniel C. Wyeth's son) were killed when the automobile they were riding in was struck by a freight train at a railway crossing (39.870747\u00b0, -75.576979\u00b0) near his Chadds Ford home.<ref>Kohler & Carson 1988, p. 205</ref> At the time, Wyeth had been working on an ambitious series of murals for the [[Metropolitan Life Insurance Company]] depicting the Pilgrims at Plymouth, a series completed by Andrew Wyeth and John McCoy.\n\nSignificant public collections of Wyeth's work are on display at the [[Brandywine River Museum]] in Chadds Ford, in Maine at the [[Portland Museum of Art]], and at the [[Farnsworth Art Museum]] in [[Rockland, Maine]].

An ancestor, Nicholas Wyeth, a stonemason, came to Massachusetts from England in 1645. Later ancestors were prominent participants in the French and Indian Wars, the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, and the American Civil War, passing down rich oral histories and tradition to Wyeth and his family and providing subject matter for his art, which was deeply felt. His maternal ancestors came from Switzerland, and during his childhood, his mother was acquainted with literary giants [[Henry David Thoreau]] and [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]]. His literary appreciation and artistic talents appear to have come from her.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kohler|first1=Sue A.|last2=Carson|first2=Jeffrey R.|title=Sixteenth Street Architecture.

C.|page=204}}</ref>\n\nHe was the oldest of four brothers who spent much time hunting, fishing, and enjoying other outdoor pursuits, and doing chores on their farm. His varied youthful activities and his naturally astute sense of observation later aided the authenticity of his illustrations and obviated the need for models: \"When I paint a figure on horseback, a man plowing, or a woman buffeted by the wind, I have an acute sense of the muscle strain.\"<ref>''An American Vision: Three Generations of Wyeth Art'', Little Brown and Company, Boston, 1987, {{ISBN|0-8212-1652-X}}, p. 4</ref>\n\nHis mother encouraged his early inclination toward art. Wyeth was doing excellent watercolor paintings by the age of twelve.<ref>''An American Vision'', p. 78</ref> He went to Mechanics Arts School to learn drafting, and then Massachusetts Normal Art School, now [[Massachusetts College of Art and Design]], where painting instructor Richard Andrew advised him to become an illustrator,  and then the [[Eric Pape]] School of Art to learn illustration, under [[George Loftus Noyes]] and Charles W.

In 1904, the same magazine commissioned him to illustrate a Western story, and Pyle urged Wyeth to go West to acquire direct knowledge, much as [[Zane Grey]] had done for his Western novels. In Colorado, he worked as a cowboy alongside the professional \"punchers\", moving cattle and doing ranch chores. He visited the [[Navajo people|Navajo]] in Arizona and gained an understanding of Native American culture. When his money was stolen, he worked as a mail carrier, riding between the Two Grey Hills trading post and Fort Defiance, to earn enough to get back home. He wrote home, \"The life is wonderful, strange\u2014the fascination of it clutches me like some unseen animal\u2014it seems to whisper, 'Come back, you belong here, this is your real home.'\"<ref>''An American Vision'', p. 12</ref>\n\nOn a second trip two years later, he collected information on mining and brought home costumes and artifacts, including cowboy and Indian clothing. His early trips to the western United States inspired a period of images of [[cowboy]]s and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] that dramatized the [[American Old West|Old West]].<ref name=barewalls />\n\nUpon returning to Chadds Ford, he painted a series of farm scenes for ''[[Charles Scribner's Sons|Scribner's]]'', finding the landscape less dramatic than that of the West but nonetheless a rich environment for his art: \"Everything lies in its subtleties, everything is so gentle and simple, so unaffected.\"<ref>''An American Vision'', p. 16</ref> His painting ''Mowing'' (1907), not done for illustration, was among his most successful images of rural life.\n\nWyeth created a stimulating household for his talented children [[Andrew Wyeth]], [[Henriette Wyeth|Henriette Wyeth Hurd]], [[Carolyn Wyeth]], [[Ann Wyeth McCoy]], and [[Nathaniel Wyeth (inventor)|Nathaniel C. Wyeth]]. Wyeth was very sociable, and frequent visitors included [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]], [[Joseph Hergesheimer]], [[Hugh Walpole]], [[Lillian Gish]], and [[John Gilbert (actor)|John Gilbert]]. According to Andrew, who spent the most time with his father due to his sickly childhood, Wyeth was a strict but patient father who did not talk down to his children.<ref>An American Vision, p. 78</ref> His hard work as an illustrator gave his family the financial freedom to follow their own artistic and scientific pursuits. Andrew went on to become one of the foremost American artists of the second half of the 20th century, and both Henriette and Carolyn became artists also; Ann became an artist and composer. Nathaniel became an engineer for [[DuPont]] and worked on the team that invented the plastic soda bottle. Henriette and Ann married two of Wyeth's prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, [[Peter Hurd]] and [[John W. McCoy]]. Wyeth is the grandfather of artists [[Jamie Wyeth]] and Michael Hurd, and the musician [[Howard Wyeth]].<ref name=Fisk>{{cite web| author= Fisk, Dean| title= FISKE-L: Re-Nicholas Wyeth / John Fiske & Sara Wyeth| date= August 5, 1998| url= http://archiver.rootsweb.com/th/read/FISKE/1998-08/0902302187| accessdate= February 19, 2007| archive-url= https://archive.is/20130104151958/http://archiver.rootsweb.com/th/read/FISKE/1998-08/0902302187| archive-date= January 4, 2013| url-status= dead}}</ref>\n\nBy 1911, Wyeth began to move away from Western subjects and on to illustrating classic literature. He painted a series for an edition of ''[[Treasure Island]]'' (1911), by [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], thought by many to be his finest group of illustrations. The set made him famous, and the proceeds from this great success paid for his house and studio.<ref>''An American Vision'', p. 29</ref> He also illustrated editions of ''[[Kidnapped (book)|Kidnapped]]'' (1913), ''[[Robin Hood]]'' (1917), ''[[The Last of the Mohicans]]'' (1919), ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'' (1920), ''[[Rip Van Winkle]]'' (1921), ''[[The White Company]]'' (1922), and ''[[The Yearling]]'' (1939). He did work for prominent periodicals, including ''[[The Century Magazine|Century]]'', ''[[Harper's Monthly]]'', ''[[Ladies' Home Journal]]'', ''[[McClure's]]'', ''[[Outing]]'', ''[[The Popular Magazine]]'', and [[Charles Scribner's Sons|Scribner's]].\n\nBy 1914, Wyeth loathed the commercialism upon which he became dependent, and for the rest of his life he battled internally over his capitulation, accusing himself of having \"bitched myself with the accursed success in skin-deep pictures and illustrations\".

He painted murals of historical and allegorical subjects for the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, the Westtown School, the First National Bank of Boston, the Hotel Roosevelt, the Franklin Savings Bank, the National Geographic Society, the Wilmington Savings Fund Society, and other public and private buildings. During both World Wars, he contributed patriotic images to government and private agencies.<ref>Chenoweth, H. Avery.

Wyeth was a member of  [[The Franklin Inn Club]] in Philadelphia.\n\n[[File:Self-portrait by N. C. Wyeth, 1940, National Academy of Design.JPG|thumb|right|''Self-portrait'' by N. C. Wyeth, 1940]]\nHis nonillustrative portrait and landscape paintings changed dramatically in style throughout his life as he experimented first with impressionism in the 1910s (feeling an affinity with the nearby \"New Hope Group\"), the principles of the divisionist painter [[Giovanni Segantini]], then by the 1930s veering to the realistic American regionalism of [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]] and [[Grant Wood]], painting with thin oils and, occasionally, egg tempera. That was the medium favored by his son, Andrew, and introduced to both of them by his son-in-law Peter Hurd. Wyeth worked rapidly and experimented constantly, often working on a larger scale than necessary, befitting his energetic and grand vision, which often harked back to his ancestral past. He could conceive, sketch out, and paint a large painting in as little as three hours.<ref>''An American Vision'', p. 80</ref>\n\n==Death and legacy==\nIn June 1945, he had received the honorary degree of master of arts from [[Bowdoin College]]. Wyeth was a member of the National Academy, the Society of Illustrators, the Philadelphia Water Color Club, the Fellowship of the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]], the Philadelphia Art Alliance, the Chester County Art Association, and the [[Wilmington Society of the Fine Arts]]. {{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\nIn October 1945, Wyeth and his grandson (Nathaniel C. Wyeth's son) were killed when the automobile they were riding in was struck by a freight train at a railway crossing (39.870747\u00b0, -75.576979\u00b0) near his Chadds Ford home.<ref>Kohler & Carson 1988, p. 205</ref> At the time, Wyeth had been working on an ambitious series of murals for the [[Metropolitan Life Insurance Company]] depicting the Pilgrims at Plymouth, a series completed by Andrew Wyeth and John McCoy.\n\nSignificant public collections of Wyeth's work are on display at the [[Brandywine River Museum]] in Chadds Ford, in Maine at the [[Portland Museum of Art]], and at the [[Farnsworth Art Museum]] in [[Rockland, Maine]]. The Brandywine River Museum offers tours of the [[N. C. Wyeth House and Studio]] in Chadds Ford. The home and studio were designated as a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1997.<ref>{{cite web|title=The N.C.
