It has a gangway through the centre to allow passengers to pass between the two parts of the train.\n\n== Specifications ==\nThe FLIRT is a new generation of multiple units, even though it has a striking resemblance with [[Stadler GTW|GTW]] vehicles. The trains can have two to six sections and electric variants are available for all commonly used power supply systems (AC and DC) as well as [[Standard gauge|standard]] and [[Russian gauge|broad gauge]]. It has [[jacobs bogie]]s shared between the individual coaches, with wide walk-through gangways. The floor height at the entrances can be chosen by the operator, providing level boarding at most stations. [[Railway coupling#Multi-Function Couplers|Automatic couplers]] of either Schwab type (on all Swiss units) or [[Scharfenberg coupler|Scharfenberg type]] at both ends of the train allow up to four trains to be connected.\n\nAll FLIRT variations use [[Insulated-gate bipolar transistor|IGBT-based traction converters]] from [[ABB Group|ABB]], which drive the [[induction motor]]s located in the two bogies at either end of the train. On the two-section trains, only one bogie is powered, while on longer versions it is possible to have a third powered bogie in the middle, found on the trains for [[Vy (transport operator)|Vy]] in Norway and for [[PKP Intercity]] in Poland. Each bogie usually has a continuous power rating of {{convert|1000|kW|hp|abbr=on}} giving a typical four-section train {{convert|2000|kW|hp|abbr=on}} total power output as well as maximum power output of {{convert|2600|kW|hp|abbr=on}} over a short time. Depending on the number of powered bogies, the length and weight, they will reach top speeds between {{convert|120|and|200|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} (typically {{convert|160|km/h|mph|abbr=on|disp=or}}). Acceleration also varies between {{convert|0.8|and|1.2|m/s2|ft/s2|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe diesel version is essentially an electric version with a diesel power module inserted, generating electricity for the electric motors. In [[TEXRail]] application, the diesel power module contains two 520&nbsp;kW  [[Deutz AG]] TCD 16.0 V8 that complies with [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|US EPA]] Tier 4 emission standard.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/traction-rolling-stock/single-view/view/stadler-unveils-tex-rail-flirt-dmu.html|title=Stadler unveils TEX Rail Flirt DMU|date=2017-10-10}}</ref>\n\n==Operators==\n===Algeria===\nOn 18 March 2006, the Algerian operator [[SNTF]] announced that it had ordered 64 four-car EMUs for suburban services in [[Algiers]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/stadler-wins-alger-contract.html|title=Stadler wins Alger contract|date=1 May 2006|work=[[Railway Gazette International]]}}</ref> The trains were delivered between 2008\u201310.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/first-flirt-to-algeria.html|title=First Flirt to Algeria|date=8 January 2008|work=[[Railway Gazette International]]}}</ref>\n\n===Azerbaijan===\nIn November 2019, it was announced that [[Azerbaijan Railways|Az\u0259rbaycan D\u0259mir Yollar\u0131 (Azerbaijan Railways)]] had placed a \u20ac115 million order for ten [[5 ft and 1520 mm gauge railways|Russian gauge]] Stadler FLIRT units in various configurations, for delivery to start taking place in 2022.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://railcolornews.com/2019/11/27/az-broad-gauge-network-broad-gauge-flirts-for-azerbaijan/|title=Broad-gauge network FLIRTs for Azerbaijan|date=27 November 2019|work=Railcolor News}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://caspiannews.com/news-detail/azerbaijan-brings-stadlers-cutting-edge-trains-to-caspian-2019-11-27-34/|title=Azerbaijan Brings Stadler\u2019s Cutting-Edge Trains to Caspian|date=27 November 2019|work=Caspian News}}</ref>\n\nThe order specification is as follows:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stadlerrail.com/es/media/article/stadler-sells-its-flirt-to-azerbaijan-for-the-first-time/657/|title=Stadler sells its FLIRT to Azerbaijan for the first time|date=27 November 2019|work=Stadler Rail AG}}</ref>\n* 3x [[Electric multiple unit|EMU]] for suburban trains\n* 3x EMU for regional trains\n* 4x [[Diesel multiple unit|DMU]] for regional trains\nTrain length is to range between 93 metres and 107 metres, with capacity varying from 236 to 271 passengers.\n\nBecause the Azerbaijan Railway is currently converting the [[Railway electrification system|electrification]] voltage of many lines on its network from [[List of railway electrification systems#3 kV DC|3kV DC]] to [[25 kV AC railway electrification|25\u00a0kV AC]], the diesel fleet will be introduced first, allowing the service to be upheld during this conversion process.\n\n===Belarus===\nTen [[5 ft and 1520 mm gauge railways|Russian gauge]] units were delivered to the [[Belarusian Railways]]<ref>[http://www.stadlerrail.com/medien/2010/03/19/stadler-gewinnt-in-weissrussland/ Stadler wins in Belarus] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716125641/http://www.stadlerrail.com/medien/2010/03/19/stadler-gewinnt-in-weissrussland/ |date=16 July 2011 }}</ref> in 2011.

passenger [[multiple unit]] trainset made by [[Stadler Rail]] of Switzerland. The baseline design of FLIRT is an electric multiple unit [[Articulated car|articulated trainset]] that can come in units of two to twelve cars with two to six motorized axles. The maximum speed is {{convert|200|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. Standard floor height is {{convert|57|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}, but {{convert|78|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} high floors are also available for platform heights of {{convert|76|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}. \n\nThe FLIRT train was originally developed for the [[Swiss Federal Railways]] and was first delivered in 2004.

It has a gangway through the centre to allow passengers to pass between the two parts of the train.\n\n== Specifications ==\nThe FLIRT is a new generation of multiple units, even though it has a striking resemblance with [[Stadler GTW|GTW]] vehicles. The trains can have two to six sections and electric variants are available for all commonly used power supply systems (AC and DC) as well as [[Standard gauge|standard]] and [[Russian gauge|broad gauge]]. It has [[jacobs bogie]]s shared between the individual coaches, with wide walk-through gangways. The floor height at the entrances can be chosen by the operator, providing level boarding at most stations. [[Railway coupling#Multi-Function Couplers|Automatic couplers]] of either Schwab type (on all Swiss units) or [[Scharfenberg coupler|Scharfenberg type]] at both ends of the train allow up to four trains to be connected.\n\nAll FLIRT variations use [[Insulated-gate bipolar transistor|IGBT-based traction converters]] from [[ABB Group|ABB]], which drive the [[induction motor]]s located in the two bogies at either end of the train. On the two-section trains, only one bogie is powered, while on longer versions it is possible to have a third powered bogie in the middle, found on the trains for [[Vy (transport operator)|Vy]] in Norway and for [[PKP Intercity]] in Poland. Each bogie usually has a continuous power rating of {{convert|1000|kW|hp|abbr=on}} giving a typical four-section train {{convert|2000|kW|hp|abbr=on}} total power output as well as maximum power output of {{convert|2600|kW|hp|abbr=on}} over a short time. Depending on the number of powered bogies, the length and weight, they will reach top speeds between {{convert|120|and|200|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} (typically {{convert|160|km/h|mph|abbr=on|disp=or}}). Acceleration also varies between {{convert|0.8|and|1.2|m/s2|ft/s2|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe diesel version is essentially an electric version with a diesel power module inserted, generating electricity for the electric motors. In [[TEXRail]] application, the diesel power module contains two 520&nbsp;kW  [[Deutz AG]] TCD 16.0 V8 that complies with [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|US EPA]] Tier 4 emission standard.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/traction-rolling-stock/single-view/view/stadler-unveils-tex-rail-flirt-dmu.html|title=Stadler unveils TEX Rail Flirt DMU|date=2017-10-10}}</ref>\n\n==Operators==\n===Algeria===\nOn 18 March 2006, the Algerian operator [[SNTF]] announced that it had ordered 64 four-car EMUs for suburban services in [[Algiers]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/stadler-wins-alger-contract.html|title=Stadler wins Alger contract|date=1 May 2006|work=[[Railway Gazette International]]}}</ref> The trains were delivered between 2008\u201310.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/first-flirt-to-algeria.html|title=First Flirt to Algeria|date=8 January 2008|work=[[Railway Gazette International]]}}</ref>\n\n===Azerbaijan===\nIn November 2019, it was announced that [[Azerbaijan Railways|Az\u0259rbaycan D\u0259mir Yollar\u0131 (Azerbaijan Railways)]] had placed a \u20ac115 million order for ten [[5 ft and 1520 mm gauge railways|Russian gauge]] Stadler FLIRT units in various configurations, for delivery to start taking place in 2022.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://railcolornews.com/2019/11/27/az-broad-gauge-network-broad-gauge-flirts-for-azerbaijan/|title=Broad-gauge network FLIRTs for Azerbaijan|date=27 November 2019|work=Railcolor News}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://caspiannews.com/news-detail/azerbaijan-brings-stadlers-cutting-edge-trains-to-caspian-2019-11-27-34/|title=Azerbaijan Brings Stadler\u2019s Cutting-Edge Trains to Caspian|date=27 November 2019|work=Caspian News}}</ref>\n\nThe order specification is as follows:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stadlerrail.com/es/media/article/stadler-sells-its-flirt-to-azerbaijan-for-the-first-time/657/|title=Stadler sells its FLIRT to Azerbaijan for the first time|date=27 November 2019|work=Stadler Rail AG}}</ref>\n* 3x [[Electric multiple unit|EMU]] for suburban trains\n* 3x EMU for regional trains\n* 4x [[Diesel multiple unit|DMU]] for regional trains\nTrain length is to range between 93 metres and 107 metres, with capacity varying from 236 to 271 passengers.\n\nBecause the Azerbaijan Railway is currently converting the [[Railway electrification system|electrification]] voltage of many lines on its network from [[List of railway electrification systems#3 kV DC|3kV DC]] to [[25 kV AC railway electrification|25\u00a0kV AC]], the diesel fleet will be introduced first, allowing the service to be upheld during this conversion process.\n\n===Belarus===\nTen [[5 ft and 1520 mm gauge railways|Russian gauge]] units were delivered to the [[Belarusian Railways]]<ref>[http://www.stadlerrail.com/medien/2010/03/19/stadler-gewinnt-in-weissrussland/ Stadler wins in Belarus] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716125641/http://www.stadlerrail.com/medien/2010/03/19/stadler-gewinnt-in-weissrussland/ |date=16 July 2011 }}</ref> in 2011.

These in similar to the FLIRT 3's owned by Greater Anglia in the UK will have an extra carriage for diesel generators, in order to operate fully electric on electrified parts of the railway and Diesel supported by batteries on tracks without wires.  \n\nIn total 14 trainsets of the Hybrid type 76 will be delivered to serve the Tr\u00f8nder Commuter Rail aswell as the Mer\u00e5ker and R\u00f8ros Lines. These will replace the Ageing Class 92's built by Duewag which are fully diesel. All this is included Bane Nor's (Norways Rail Management Agency) and Jernbaneverkets  plan to finally modernize the Tr\u00f8ndelag Railways, which have outdated buildings and infastructure. \n\n===Poland===\n[[File:ED160-009, Trako 2015, 2015-09-25 (Muri WG 2015-34).jpg|thumb|FLIRT 3 for Polish PKP Intercity carrier]]\n[[Koleje Mazowieckie]] in 2008 bought 10 four-car 3&nbsp;kV DC units for services in the [[Warsaw]] region.\n[[Koleje \u015al\u0105skie]] (K\u015a) bought 4 four-car 3&nbsp;kV DC units for service in [[Silesia]].

The film is based on some of Arcan's own writings, including her book ''Putain''.\n\nAfter debuting at the [[2016 Toronto International Film Festival]], the film received some positive reviews, including for Mackay's performance. It was nominated for two [[5th Canadian Screen Awards|Canadian Screen Awards]] and won for [[Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television Award for Best Achievement in Costume Design|Best Costume Design]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[Nelly Arcan|Isabelle Fortier]] is a young girl who develops a relationship and becomes engaged to a man, with whom she shares a [[cocaine]] habit. Their relationship deteriorates. Taking the [[pseudonym]] Cynthia, Isabelle becomes a prostitute. She receives rave online [[customer review]]s, from clients who praise her for her physical features, service and aptitude in various sex acts. She begins to write about her experiences, submitting her first novel under the [[pen name]] Nelly Arcan to an editorial committee, who regard it with a combination of shock and interest. The publisher Mathieu travels to [[Montreal]] to meet her, inquiring if the stories contained in the novel are [[autobiography|autobiographical]]. Initially questioning the importance of the novel's truthfulness, Nelly replies the stories are a combination of reality and invention. She also lies and says she is 26, as she had always wished to be published before turning 30.\n\nThe novel exceeds the bestseller benchmark of 5,000 sales, with 30,000 copies sold in Quebec and France. Nelly receives critical acclaim and is nominated for prestigious European literary awards. At the same time, she is conflicted about the exposure, feeling as if she lost something with the publication of the novel. Her adoring public is intrigued and eager to learn more about whether the stories she tells are true, while she becomes panicked that her next book may not sell or may be a critical failure. One reader inquires about an episode in her work where a prostitute jumps from a building to escape a violent client, which Nelly had extracted from a dream, and questions her about her later books falling in sales.\n\nIn [[Confession (religion)|confession]], Nelly speaks of how everything in her life seems to be killing her, and questions if Nelly Arcan or Isabelle Fortier is the real mask. She finally commits suicide after three books have been published, with a fourth published posthumously.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Myl\u00e8ne Mackay]] as [[Nelly Arcan]]\n*[[Marie-Claude Guerin]] as Melina\n*[[Sylvie Drapeau]] as Suzanne\n*[[Milya Corbeil-Gauvreau]] as [[Nelly Arcan|Isabelle Fortier]]\n*[[Francis Leplay]] as Mathieu\n*[[Noa Andr\u00e9]] as Vanessa\n*[[Micka\u00ebl Gouin]] as Fran\u00e7ois\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film is a biopic of the deceased writer [[Nelly Arcan]],<ref name=\"Houdassine\">{{Cite news|url=http://quebec.huffingtonpost.ca/2015/09/29/anne-emond-nelly-arcand_n_8215988.html |title=Anne \u00c9mond et les fant\u00f4mes de Nelly Arcan |last=Houdassine |first=Isma\u00ebl |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |date=29 September 2015 |accessdate=2 March 2017}}</ref> starring [[Myl\u00e8ne Mackay]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tiff.net/the-review/a-conservation-between-anne-emond-and-chloe-robichaud/ |title=A Conversation Between Anne \u00c9mond And Chlo\u00e9 Robichaud |date=9 September 2016 |accessdate=11 October 2016 |work=The Review}}</ref> Producer Nicole Robert intended to make a film adaptation of Arcan's book ''Putain'' while Arcan was still alive,<ref name=\"Tremblay\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ledevoir.com/culture/cinema/479775/nelly-a-coeur-ouvert |title=Nelly \u00e0 coeur ouvert |last=Tremblay |first=Odile |work=[[Le Devoir]] |date=12 September 2016 |accessdate=2 March 2017}}</ref> and obtained the rights in 2003.<ref name=\"Houdassine\"/>\n\nDirector [[Anne \u00c9mond]] said she had re-read Arcan's books on multiple occasions, desiring to make a film adaptation.

award-winning Canadian author and former [[Prostitution in Canada|sex worker]] who committed suicide in 2009. The film is based on some of Arcan's own writings, including her book ''Putain''.\n\nAfter debuting at the [[2016 Toronto International Film Festival]], the film received some positive reviews, including for Mackay's performance. It was nominated for two [[5th Canadian Screen Awards|Canadian Screen Awards]] and won for [[Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television Award for Best Achievement in Costume Design|Best Costume Design]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[Nelly Arcan|Isabelle Fortier]] is a young girl who develops a relationship and becomes engaged to a man, with whom she shares a [[cocaine]] habit. Their relationship deteriorates. Taking the [[pseudonym]] Cynthia, Isabelle becomes a prostitute. She receives rave online [[customer review]]s, from clients who praise her for her physical features, service and aptitude in various sex acts. She begins to write about her experiences, submitting her first novel under the [[pen name]] Nelly Arcan to an editorial committee, who regard it with a combination of shock and interest. The publisher Mathieu travels to [[Montreal]] to meet her, inquiring if the stories contained in the novel are [[autobiography|autobiographical]]. Initially questioning the importance of the novel's truthfulness, Nelly replies the stories are a combination of reality and invention. She also lies and says she is 26, as she had always wished to be published before turning 30.\n\nThe novel exceeds the bestseller benchmark of 5,000 sales, with 30,000 copies sold in Quebec and France. Nelly receives critical acclaim and is nominated for prestigious European literary awards. At the same time, she is conflicted about the exposure, feeling as if she lost something with the publication of the novel. Her adoring public is intrigued and eager to learn more about whether the stories she tells are true, while she becomes panicked that her next book may not sell or may be a critical failure. One reader inquires about an episode in her work where a prostitute jumps from a building to escape a violent client, which Nelly had extracted from a dream, and questions her about her later books falling in sales.\n\nIn [[Confession (religion)|confession]], Nelly speaks of how everything in her life seems to be killing her, and questions if Nelly Arcan or Isabelle Fortier is the real mask. She finally commits suicide after three books have been published, with a fourth published posthumously.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Myl\u00e8ne Mackay]] as [[Nelly Arcan]]\n*[[Marie-Claude Guerin]] as Melina\n*[[Sylvie Drapeau]] as Suzanne\n*[[Milya Corbeil-Gauvreau]] as [[Nelly Arcan|Isabelle Fortier]]\n*[[Francis Leplay]] as Mathieu\n*[[Noa Andr\u00e9]] as Vanessa\n*[[Micka\u00ebl Gouin]] as Fran\u00e7ois\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film is a biopic of the deceased writer [[Nelly Arcan]],<ref name=\"Houdassine\">{{Cite news|url=http://quebec.huffingtonpost.ca/2015/09/29/anne-emond-nelly-arcand_n_8215988.html |title=Anne \u00c9mond et les fant\u00f4mes de Nelly Arcan |last=Houdassine |first=Isma\u00ebl |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |date=29 September 2015 |accessdate=2 March 2017}}</ref> starring [[Myl\u00e8ne Mackay]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tiff.net/the-review/a-conservation-between-anne-emond-and-chloe-robichaud/ |title=A Conversation Between Anne \u00c9mond And Chlo\u00e9 Robichaud |date=9 September 2016 |accessdate=11 October 2016 |work=The Review}}</ref> Producer Nicole Robert intended to make a film adaptation of Arcan's book ''Putain'' while Arcan was still alive,<ref name=\"Tremblay\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ledevoir.com/culture/cinema/479775/nelly-a-coeur-ouvert |title=Nelly \u00e0 coeur ouvert |last=Tremblay |first=Odile |work=[[Le Devoir]] |date=12 September 2016 |accessdate=2 March 2017}}</ref> and obtained the rights in 2003.<ref name=\"Houdassine\"/>\n\nDirector [[Anne \u00c9mond]] said she had re-read Arcan's books on multiple occasions, desiring to make a film adaptation.

Using large non-gravitational forces on the highly eccentric orbit, a solution could be generated with an eccentricity of about 1, an Earth [[minimum orbit intersection distance]] (MOID) of {{Convert|0.34|au|e6km|abbr=unit}}, and a perihelion at {{nowrap|0.90 au}} around 30 December 2019.<ref name=Gray35237 /> However, based on available observations, the orbit could only be parabolic if non-gravitational forces (thrust due to outgassing) affected its orbit more than any previous comets.<ref name=Gray234c /> Eventually with more observations the orbit converged to the hyperbolic solution that indicated an interstellar origin and non-gravitational forces could not explain the motion.<ref name=MPECK19RA6 />\n\n=== 2019\u20132020 ===\n[[File:Video-NASA-InterstellarComet-2IBorisov-HubbleST-20191016.webm|thumb|right|''Hubble'' started observations of 2I/Borisov in October 2019, two months prior to the comet's closest approach to the Sun]]\nUnless the comet fades or disintegrates unexpectedly, it should be observable until at least September 2020.<ref name=MPECK19RA6 /> Observation of 2I/Borisov is aided by the fact that the comet was detected while inbound towards the Solar System. \u02bbOumuamua had been discovered as it was leaving the system, and thus could only be observed for 80 days before it was out of range.

{"title_page": "Beacon", "text_new": "{{Other uses|Beacon (disambiguation)}}\nA '''beacon''' is an intentionally conspicuous device designed to attract attention to a [[Geodetic datum|specific location]]. A common example is the [[lighthouse]], which provides a fixed location that can be used to navigate around obstacles or into port. More modern examples include a variety of [[radio beacon]]s that can be read on [[radio direction finder]]s in all weather, and [[Transponder|radar transponder]]s that appear on [[radar]] displays.\n\nBeacons can also be combined with semaphoric or other indicators to provide important [[information]], such as the status of an airport, by the colour and rotational pattern of its [[aerodrome beacon|airport beacon]], or of pending weather as indicated on a [[weather beacon]] mounted at the top of a tall building or similar site. When used in such fashion, beacons can be considered a form of [[Telegraph#Optical telegraph|optical telegraphy]].\n\n== For navigation ==\n[[File:Beacon at Orontes Bank.jpg|right|thumb|A navigational beacon denoting the presence of Orontes Bank off [[Port Vincent, South Australia]].]]\n\nBeacons help guide [[navigation|navigators]] to their destinations. Types of navigational beacons include [[radar]] reflectors, [[radio beacons]], sonic and visual signals. Visual beacons range from small, single-pile structures to large [[lighthouse]]s or light stations and can be located on land or on water. Lighted beacons are called ''lights''; unlighted beacons are called ''[[Day beacon|daybeacon]]s''. [[Aerodrome beacon]]s are used to indicate locations of airports and helipads.\n\nHandheld beacons are also employed in [[aircraft marshalling]], and are used by the marshal to deliver instructions to the crew of aircraft as they move around an active airport, heliport or aircraft carrier.\n\n== For defensive communications (historical) ==\n[[File:Culmstock, Culmstock Beacon - geograph.org.uk - 213525.jpg|thumb|left|16th-century beacon hut in Culmstock, Devon, England]]\n\nClassically, beacons were fires lit at well-known locations on hills or high places, used either as [[lighthouse]]s for [[navigational aid|navigation at sea]], or for signalling over land that enemy troops were approaching, in order to alert defenses. As signals, beacons are an ancient form of [[optical telegraph]] and were part of a [[relay league]].\n\nSystems of this kind have existed for centuries over much of the world. The ancient Greeks called them ''[[phryctoriae]]'', while beacons figure on several occasions on the [[column of Trajan]].\n\nIn ancient China, sentinels on and near the [[Great Wall|Great Wall of China]] used a sophisticated system of daytime smoke and nighttime flame to send signals along long chains of beacon towers.<ref name=\"travelchinaguide.com\">https://www.travelchinaguide.com/china_great_wall/construction/tower/</ref>\n\nLegend has it that Zh\u014du Y\u014du W\u00e1ng, king of the Western Zhou dynasty, played a trick multiple times in order to amuse his often melancholy concubine, ordering beacon towers lit to fool his Marquess and soldiers. At some point, friends became enemies and when enemies, led by [[Sh\u0113nh\u00f3u|Marquess of Shen]] really arrived at the wall. But this time, when the towers were lit, no defenders came, leading to Y\u014du's death and the colapse of the Western Zhou dynasty.<ref name=\"travelchinaguide.com\"/><ref>Cambridge History of Ancient China, 1999, pages 546 and 551</ref><ref>Giles, Herbert A.

Chapter 1</ref>\n\nIn the 10th century, during the [[Arab\u2013Byzantine wars]], the [[Byzantine Empire]] used a [[Byzantine beacon system|beacon system]] to transmit messages from the border with the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], across [[Anatolia]] to the [[Great Palace of Constantinople|imperial palace]] in the Byzantine capital, [[Constantinople]]. It was devised by [[Leo the Mathematician]] for Emperor [[Theophilos (emperor)|Theophilos]], but either abolished or radically curtailed by Theophilos' son and successor, [[Michael III]].<ref name=\"ODB\">{{cite encyclopedia | last = Foss | first = Clive | authorlink= | title = Beacon | editor-last=Kazhdan | editor-first=Alexander | editor-link=Alexander Kazhdan |year=1991 | encyclopedia =[[The Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium]] | publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-504652-6 | pages=273\u2013274}}</ref> Beacons were later used in Greece as well, while the surviving parts of the beacon system in Anatolia seem to have been reactivated in the 12th century by Emperor [[Manuel I Komnenos]].<ref name=\"ODB\" />\n\nIn Scandinavia many [[hill fort]]s were part of beacon networks to warn against invading pillagers. In Finland, these beacons were called ''vainovalkeat'', \"persecution fires\", or ''vartiotulet'', \"guard fires\", and were used to warn Finn settlements of imminent raids by the Vikings.\n\nIn [[Wales]], the [[Brecon Beacons]] were named for beacons used to warn of approaching English raiders. In England, the most famous examples are the beacons used in [[Elizabethan England]] to warn of the approaching [[Spanish Armada]]. Many hills in England were named Beacon Hill after such beacons. In England the authority to erect beacons originally lay with the King and later was deligated to the [[List of Lord High Admirals (United Kingdom)|Lord High Admiral]]. The money due for the maintenance of beacons was called ''Beaconagium'' and was levied by the sheriff of each county.<ref>''The National Cyclopaedia of Useful Knowledge'', Vol III, (1847) Charles Knight, London, p.25.</ref> In the [[Scottish border]]s country, a system of beacon fires was at one time established to warn of incursions by the English. [[Hume Castle|Hume]] and Eggerstone castles and Soltra Edge were part of this network.<ref>Ritchie, Leitch (1835). ''Scott and Scotland''. London: Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown, Green, and Longman, p. 53</ref> The [[Great Wall of China]] is also a beacon network.\n\nIn Spain, the border of [[Granada]] in the territory of the [[Crown of Castile]] had a complex beacon network to warn against Moorish raiders and military campaigns.<ref>Els almog\u00e1vers a la frontera amb el sarrains en el segle XIV. Maria Teresa Ferrer</ref>\n\n== On vehicles ==\n{{Main|Emergency vehicle lighting}}\n[[File:Beacon positions.jpg|thumb|Beacon positions on police car]]\n\nVehicular beacons are rotating or flashing lights affixed to the top of a vehicle to attract the attention of surrounding vehicles and pedestrians. [[Emergency vehicle]]s such as fire engines, ambulances, police cars, tow trucks, construction vehicles, and snow-removal vehicles carry beacon lights.\n\nThe color of the lamps varies by jurisdiction; typical colors are blue and/or red for police, fire, and medical-emergency vehicles; amber for hazards (slow-moving vehicles, wide loads, tow trucks, security personnel, construction vehicles, etc.); green for volunteer firefighters or for medical personnel, and violet for funerary vehicles. Beacons may be constructed with [[Automotive lamp types|halogen bulbs]] similar to those used in vehicle [[headlamp]]s, xenon [[flashtube]]s, or [[Light emitting diode|LEDs]].<ref>{{cite journal\n |title=Evaluation of Light-Emitting Diode Beacon Light Fixtures \n |journal=Lighting Research Center \u2013 Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute \n |date=December 2009 \n |first=John \n |last=Bullough \n |author2=Nicholas P Skinner \n |url=https://www.dot.ny.gov/divisions/engineering/technical-services/trans-r-and-d-repository/LRCBeaconReport.pdf \n |format=PDF \n |accessdate=2010-06-05 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729142629/https://www.dot.ny.gov/divisions/engineering/technical-services/trans-r-and-d-repository/LRCBeaconReport.pdf \n |archivedate=2013-07-29 \n}}</ref> Incandescent and xenon light sources require the vehicle's engine to continue running to ensure that the battery is not depleted when the lights are used for a prolonged period. The low power consumption of LEDs allows the vehicle's engine to remain turned off while the lights operate nodes.\n\n== Other uses ==\nBeacons and [[bonfire]]s are also used to mark occasions and celebrate events.   \n\n\nBeacons have also allegedly been abused by [[Wrecking (shipwreck)|shipwreckers]]. An illicit fire at a wrong position would be used to direct a ship against [[shoal]]s or [[beach]]es, so that its cargo could be looted after the ship sank or ran aground.

A common example is the [[lighthouse]], which provides a fixed location that can be used to navigate around obstacles or into port. More modern examples include a variety of [[radio beacon]]s that can be read on [[radio direction finder]]s in all weather, and [[Transponder|radar transponder]]s that appear on [[radar]] displays.\n\nBeacons can also be combined with semaphoric or other indicators to provide important [[information]], such as the status of an airport, by the colour and rotational pattern of its [[aerodrome beacon|airport beacon]], or of pending weather as indicated on a [[weather beacon]] mounted at the top of a tall building or similar site. When used in such fashion, beacons can be considered a form of [[Telegraph#Optical telegraph|optical telegraphy]].\n\n== For navigation ==\n[[File:Beacon at Orontes Bank.jpg|right|thumb|A navigational beacon denoting the presence of Orontes Bank off [[Port Vincent, South Australia]].]]\n\nBeacons help guide [[navigation|navigators]] to their destinations. Types of navigational beacons include [[radar]] reflectors, [[radio beacons]], sonic and visual signals. Visual beacons range from small, single-pile structures to large [[lighthouse]]s or light stations and can be located on land or on water. Lighted beacons are called ''lights''; unlighted beacons are called ''[[Day beacon|daybeacon]]s''. [[Aerodrome beacon]]s are used to indicate locations of airports and helipads.\n\nHandheld beacons are also employed in [[aircraft marshalling]], and are used by the marshal to deliver instructions to the crew of aircraft as they move around an active airport, heliport or aircraft carrier.\n\n== For defensive communications (historical) ==\n[[File:Culmstock, Culmstock Beacon - geograph.org.uk - 213525.jpg|thumb|left|16th-century beacon hut in Culmstock, Devon, England]]\n\nClassically, beacons were fires lit at well-known locations on hills or high places, used either as [[lighthouse]]s for [[navigational aid|navigation at sea]], or for signalling over land that enemy troops were approaching, in order to alert defenses. As signals, beacons are an ancient form of [[optical telegraph]] and were part of a [[relay league]].\n\nSystems of this kind have existed for centuries over much of the world. The ancient Greeks called them ''[[phryctoriae]]'', while beacons figure on several occasions on the [[column of Trajan]].\n\nIn ancient China, sentinels on and near the [[Great Wall|Great Wall of China]] used a sophisticated system of daytime smoke and nighttime flame to send signals along long chains of beacon towers.<ref name=\"travelchinaguide.com\">https://www.travelchinaguide.com/china_great_wall/construction/tower/</ref>\n\nLegend has it that Zh\u014du Y\u014du W\u00e1ng, king of the Western Zhou dynasty, played a trick multiple times in order to amuse his often melancholy concubine, ordering beacon towers lit to fool his Marquess and soldiers. At some point, friends became enemies and when enemies, led by [[Sh\u0113nh\u00f3u|Marquess of Shen]] really arrived at the wall. But this time, when the towers were lit, no defenders came, leading to Y\u014du's death and the colapse of the Western Zhou dynasty.<ref name=\"travelchinaguide.com\"/><ref>Cambridge History of Ancient China, 1999, pages 546 and 551</ref><ref>Giles, Herbert A.

Chapter 1</ref>\n\nIn the 10th century, during the [[Arab\u2013Byzantine wars]], the [[Byzantine Empire]] used a [[Byzantine beacon system|beacon system]] to transmit messages from the border with the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], across [[Anatolia]] to the [[Great Palace of Constantinople|imperial palace]] in the Byzantine capital, [[Constantinople]]. It was devised by [[Leo the Mathematician]] for Emperor [[Theophilos (emperor)|Theophilos]], but either abolished or radically curtailed by Theophilos' son and successor, [[Michael III]].<ref name=\"ODB\">{{cite encyclopedia | last = Foss | first = Clive | authorlink= | title = Beacon | editor-last=Kazhdan | editor-first=Alexander | editor-link=Alexander Kazhdan |year=1991 | encyclopedia =[[The Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium]] | publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-504652-6 | pages=273\u2013274}}</ref> Beacons were later used in Greece as well, while the surviving parts of the beacon system in Anatolia seem to have been reactivated in the 12th century by Emperor [[Manuel I Komnenos]].<ref name=\"ODB\" />\n\nIn Scandinavia many [[hill fort]]s were part of beacon networks to warn against invading pillagers. In Finland, these beacons were called ''vainovalkeat'', \"persecution fires\", or ''vartiotulet'', \"guard fires\", and were used to warn Finn settlements of imminent raids by the Vikings.\n\nIn [[Wales]], the [[Brecon Beacons]] were named for beacons used to warn of approaching English raiders. In England, the most famous examples are the beacons used in [[Elizabethan England]] to warn of the approaching [[Spanish Armada]]. Many hills in England were named Beacon Hill after such beacons. In England the authority to erect beacons originally lay with the King and later was deligated to the [[List of Lord High Admirals (United Kingdom)|Lord High Admiral]]. The money due for the maintenance of beacons was called ''Beaconagium'' and was levied by the sheriff of each county.<ref>''The National Cyclopaedia of Useful Knowledge'', Vol III, (1847) Charles Knight, London, p.25.</ref> In the [[Scottish border]]s country, a system of beacon fires was at one time established to warn of incursions by the English. [[Hume Castle|Hume]] and Eggerstone castles and Soltra Edge were part of this network.<ref>Ritchie, Leitch (1835). ''Scott and Scotland''. London: Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown, Green, and Longman, p. 53</ref> The [[Great Wall of China]] is also a beacon network.\n\nIn Spain, the border of [[Granada]] in the territory of the [[Crown of Castile]] had a complex beacon network to warn against Moorish raiders and military campaigns.<ref>Els almog\u00e1vers a la frontera amb el sarrains en el segle XIV. Maria Teresa Ferrer</ref>\n\n== On vehicles ==\n{{Main|Emergency vehicle lighting}}\n[[File:Beacon positions.jpg|thumb|Beacon positions on police car]]\n\nVehicular beacons are rotating or flashing lights affixed to the top of a vehicle to attract the attention of surrounding vehicles and pedestrians. [[Emergency vehicle]]s such as fire engines, ambulances, police cars, tow trucks, construction vehicles, and snow-removal vehicles carry beacon lights.\n\nThe color of the lamps varies by jurisdiction; typical colors are blue and/or red for police, fire, and medical-emergency vehicles; amber for hazards (slow-moving vehicles, wide loads, tow trucks, security personnel, construction vehicles, etc.); green for volunteer firefighters or for medical personnel, and violet for funerary vehicles. Beacons may be constructed with [[Automotive lamp types|halogen bulbs]] similar to those used in vehicle [[headlamp]]s, xenon [[flashtube]]s, or [[Light emitting diode|LEDs]].<ref>{{cite journal\n |title=Evaluation of Light-Emitting Diode Beacon Light Fixtures \n |journal=Lighting Research Center \u2013 Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute \n |date=December 2009 \n |first=John \n |last=Bullough \n |author2=Nicholas P Skinner \n |url=https://www.dot.ny.gov/divisions/engineering/technical-services/trans-r-and-d-repository/LRCBeaconReport.pdf \n |format=PDF \n |accessdate=2010-06-05 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729142629/https://www.dot.ny.gov/divisions/engineering/technical-services/trans-r-and-d-repository/LRCBeaconReport.pdf \n |archivedate=2013-07-29 \n}}</ref> Incandescent and xenon light sources require the vehicle's engine to continue running to ensure that the battery is not depleted when the lights are used for a prolonged period. The low power consumption of LEDs allows the vehicle's engine to remain turned off while the lights operate nodes.\n\n== Other uses ==\nBeacons and [[bonfire]]s are also used to mark occasions and celebrate events.   \n\nB\n\nBeacons have also allegedly been abused by [[Wrecking (shipwreck)|shipwreckers]]. An illicit fire at a wrong position would be used to direct a ship against [[shoal]]s or [[beach]]es, so that its cargo could be looted after the ship sank or ran aground. There are, however, no historically substantiated occurrences of such intentional shipwrecking.\n\nIn wireless networks, a [[Electric beacon#IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi beacons|beacon]] is a type of [[Frame (networking)|frame]] which is sent by the access point (or WiFi router) to indicate that it is on.\n\nBluetooth based beacons periodically send out a data packet and this could be used by software to identify the beacon location.
