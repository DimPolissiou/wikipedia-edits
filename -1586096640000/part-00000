Chithra's father finally tells what happened in the past.\n\nMarikozhundhu lived a precarious life with her grandmother (Radha Bhai). Marikozhundhu was a kind-hearted person but she was not a good-looking woman, her dream was to get married as soon as possible. Seenu was a college student who lived with his mother ([[Manorama (Tamil actress)|Manorama]]) in the city, for the holiday he always went to his father's ([[Vinu Chakravarthy]]) village. There, Seenu was intrigued by the stubborn Marikozhundhu and he smiled each time he saw her, Marikozhundhu thought he loved her. Afterwards, the two had a sexual intercourse in the fields. At the village court, the elders arranged their marriage the next day. The day of the marriage, Marikozhundhu realized that Seenu seemed to dislike her and stopped the marriage. Seenu was in fact in love with his childhood sweetheart Uma. Seenu's father wanted his son to marry Uma, but his mother wanted her son to marry Marikozhundhu. Shortly after, Marikozhundhu became pregnant and her grandmother died.\n\nOne year later, Marikozhundhu gave birth to a baby girl. Seenu's father begged her to leave the village so that his son could marry Uma without any remorse. Marikozhundhu and her baby girl left the village, she then listened that the local factory owner had dumped toxic mercury waste from his factory into the village water. The village was close to celebrate a water ceremony, so Marikozhundhu tried to stop it but nobody believed her. Marikozhundhu had no choice than to drink the contaminated water thus she died. Seenu tied the [[Mangala sutra|thaali]] around her neck (synonym of marriage) just before she died.\n\nChithra breaks into tears after hearing the flashback, and she feels very proud of her late mother.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Ramesh Aravind]] as Seenu\n*[[Aishwarya (actress)|Aishwarya]] as Marikozhundhu and Chithra\n*[[Manorama (Tamil actress)|Manorama]] as Seenu's mother\n*[[Vinu Chakravarthy]] as Seenu's father\n*[[Nassar (actor)|Nassar]]\n*[[Goundamani]] as a building constructor\n*[[Senthil]] as the building constructor's assistant\n*Radha Bhai as Marikozhundhu's grandmother\n*Anjana as Uma\n*[[M.

Like all nematodes, they have neither a circulatory nor a respiratory system. The four bands of muscles that run the length of the body are connected to a neural system that allows the muscles to move the animal's body only as dorsal bending or ventral bending, but not left or right, except for the head, where the four muscle quadrants are wired independently from one another.  When a wave of dorsal/ventral muscle contractions proceeds from the back to the front of the animal, the animal is propelled backwards. When a wave of contractions is initiated at the front and proceeds posteriorly along the body, the animal is propelled forwards. Because of this dorsal/ventral bias in body bends, any normal living, moving individual tends to lie on either its left side or its right side when observed crossing a horizontal surface. A set of ridges on the lateral sides of the body cuticle, the alae, is believed to give the animal added traction during these bending motions.\n\nIn relation to lipid metabolism, ''C. elegans'' does not have any specialized adipose tissues, a [[pancreas]], a [[liver]], or even blood to deliver nutrients compared to mammals. Neutral lipids are instead stored in the intestine, epidermis, and embryos. The [[epidermis]] corresponds to the mammalian adipocytes by being the main [[triglyceride]] depot.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lemieux GA, Ashrafi K | title = Investigating Connections between Metabolism, Longevity, and Behavior in Caenorhabditis elegans | journal = Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 27 | issue = 8 | pages = 586\u2013596 | date = August 2016 | pmid = 27289335 | pmc = 4958586 | doi = 10.1016/j.tem.2016.05.004 }}</ref>\n\nThe pharynx is a muscular food pump in the head of ''C. elegans'', which is triangular in cross-section.

After digestion, the contents of the intestine are released via the rectum, as is the case with all other nematodes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wormbook.org/chapters/www_organformation/organformation.html|title=The ''C. elegans'' pharynx: a model for organogenesis|website=www.wormbook.org|access-date=2017-03-15}}</ref> No direct connection exists between the pharynx and the [[excretion|excretory]] canal, which functions in the release of liquid urine.\n\nMales have a single-lobed gonad, a [[vas deferens]], and a tail specialized for mating, which incorporates [[spicule (nematode)|spicules]].

These gut granules are found in all of the Rhabditida orders. They are very similar to [[lysosomes]] in that they feature an acidic interior and the capacity for [[endocytosis]], but they are considerably larger, reinforcing the view of their being storage organelles.\nA remarkable feature of the granules is that when they are observed under [[ultraviolet light]], they react by emitting an intense blue [[fluorescence]]. Another phenomenon seen is termed 'death fluorescence'. As the worms die, a dramatic burst of blue fluorescence is emitted. This death fluorescence typically takes place in an anterior to posterior wave that moves along the intestine, and is seen in both young and old worms, whether subjected to lethal injury or peacefully dying of old age. Many theories have been posited on the functions of the gut granules, with earlier ones being eliminated by later findings. They are thought to store zinc as one of their functions. Recent chemical analysis has identified the blue fluorescent material they contain as a [[glycosylated]] form of [[anthranilic acid]] (AA). The need for the large amounts of AA the many gut granules contain is questioned. One possibility is that the AA is antibacterial and used in defense against invading pathogens. Another possibility is that the granules provide photoprotection; the bursts of AA fluorescence entail the conversion of damaging UV light to relatively harmless visible light. This is seen a possible link to the [[melanin]]\u2013containing [[melanosomes]].<ref>\n{{cite journal | vauthors = Coburn C, Gems D | title = The mysterious case of the ''C. elegans'' gut granule: death fluorescence, anthranilic acid and the kynurenine pathway | journal = Frontiers in Genetics | volume = 4 | pages = 151 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23967012 | pmc = 3735983 | doi = 10.3389/fgene.2013.00151 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Caenorhabditis elegans hermaphrodite adult-en.svg|thumb|right|A lateral (left) side anatomical diagram of an adult-stage ''C. elegans'' hermaphrodite]]\n\n== Reproduction ==\n\nThe hermaphroditic worm is considered to be a specialized form of self-fertile female, as its [[Somatic cell|soma]] is female.

Like all nematodes, they have neither a circulatory nor a respiratory system. The four bands of muscles that run the length of the body are connected to a neural system that allows the muscles to move the animal's body only as dorsal bending or ventral bending, but not left or right, except for the head, where the four muscle quadrants are wired independently from one another.  When a wave of dorsal/ventral muscle contractions proceeds from the back to the front of the animal, the animal is propelled backwards. When a wave of contractions is initiated at the front and proceeds posteriorly along the body, the animal is propelled forwards. Because of this dorsal/ventral bias in body bends, any normal living, moving individual tends to lie on either its left side or its right side when observed crossing a horizontal surface. A set of ridges on the lateral sides of the body cuticle, the alae, is believed to give the animal added traction during these bending motions.\n\nIn relation to lipid metabolism, ''C. elegans'' does not have any specialized adipose tissues, a [[pancreas]], a [[liver]], or even blood to deliver nutrients compared to mammals.

These gut granules are found in all of the Rhabditida orders. They are very similar to [[lysosomes]] in that they feature an acidic interior and the capacity for [[endocytosis]], but they are considerably larger, reinforcing the view of their being storage organelles.\nA remarkable feature of the granules is that when they are observed under [[ultraviolet light]], they react by emitting an intense blue [[fluorescence]]. Another phenomenon seen is termed 'death fluorescence'. As the worms die, a dramatic burst of blue fluorescence is emitted. This death fluorescence typically takes place in an anterior to posterior wave that moves along the intestine, and is seen in both young and old worms, whether subjected to lethal injury or peacefully dying of old age. Many theories have been posited on the functions of the gut granules, with earlier ones being eliminated by later findings. They are thought to store zinc as one of their functions. Recent chemical analysis has identified the blue fluorescent material they contain as a [[glycosylated]] form of [[anthranilic acid]] (AA). The need for the large amounts of AA the many gut granules contain is questioned. One possibility is that the AA is antibacterial and used in defense against invading pathogens. Another possibility is that the granules provide photoprotection; the bursts of AA fluorescence entail the conversion of damaging UV light to relatively harmless visible light. This is seen a possible link to the [[melanin]]\u2013containing [[melanosomes]].<ref>\n{{cite journal | vauthors = Coburn C, Gems D | title = The mysterious case of the ''C. elegans'' gut granule: death fluorescence, anthranilic acid and the kynurenine pathway | journal = Frontiers in Genetics | volume = 4 | pages = 151 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23967012 | pmc = 3735983 | doi = 10.3389/fgene.2013.00151 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Caenorhabditis elegans hermaphrodite adult-en.svg|thumb|right|A lateral (left) side anatomical diagram of an adult-stage ''C. elegans'' hermaphrodite]]\n\n== Reproduction ==\n\nThe hermaphroditic worm is considered to be a specialized form of self-fertile female, as its [[Somatic cell|soma]] is female.

Crawley was planned and laid out as a [[New towns in the United Kingdom|New Town]] after the Second World War, based on the principle of self-contained neighbourhoods surrounding a town centre of civic and commercial buildings.  Northgate was one of the four in the \"inner ring\" closest to the town centre, and was the second to be completed: almost all building work on the {{convert|168|acre|ha|adj=on}} site took place in the first half of the 1950s.\n\nNorthgate is bordered by [[West Green, West Sussex|West Green]] to the west, [[Langley Green, West Sussex|Langley Green]] to the north, [[Three Bridges]] to the east and the town centre and [[Southgate, West Sussex|Southgate]] to the south.  It is one of the smaller neighbourhoods in the town, but has the standard range of buildings as proposed in the 1940s masterplan: churches, a pub, a shopping parade, a primary school, and housing of various styles and layouts.  Some older, pre-New Town buildings remain, including three with [[Listed building|listed status]] and the [[Locally listed buildings in Crawley|locally listed]] [[Dyers Almshouses]], which form part of the surviving interwar development in this part of the town.\n\n==History==\nFor most of its history, Crawley was a slowly growing [[market town]] whose focus was the north\u2013south High Street, part of the main [[London]] to [[Brighton]] road.  This was turnpiked in 1770, and at the northern and southern limits of the parish [[Toll road|tollgates]] were erected\u2014the North Gate and the South Gate.  The section of road north of Crawley, called London Road, was widened in the early 1930s and bypassed a few years later<ref name=\"VCH-Ifield\">{{cite web|url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/Sussex/vol6/pp53-60|title=A History of the County of Sussex: Volume 6 Part 3 \u2013 Bramber Rape (North-Eastern Part) including Crawley New Town.

Crawley was planned and laid out as a [[New towns in the United Kingdom|New Town]] after the Second World War, based on the principle of self-contained neighbourhoods surrounding a town centre of civic and commercial buildings.  Northgate was one of the four in the \"inner ring\" closest to the town centre, and was the second to be completed: almost all building work on the {{convert|168|acre|ha|adj=on}} site took place in the first half of the 1950s.\n\nNorthgate is bordered by [[West Green, West Sussex|West Green]] to the west, [[Langley Green, West Sussex|Langley Green]] to the north, [[Three Bridges]] to the east and the town centre and [[Southgate, West Sussex|Southgate]] to the south.  It is one of the smaller neighbourhoods in the town, but has the standard range of buildings as proposed in the 1940s masterplan: churches, a pub, a shopping parade, a primary school, and housing of various styles and layouts.  Some older, pre-New Town buildings remain, including three with [[Listed building|listed status]] and the [[Locally listed buildings in Crawley|locally listed]] [[Dyers Almshouses]], which form part of the surviving interwar development in this part of the town.\n\n==History==\nFor most of its history, Crawley was a slowly growing [[market town]] whose focus was the north\u2013south High Street, part of the main [[London]] to [[Brighton]] road.  This was turnpiked in 1770, and at the northern and southern limits of the parish [[Toll road|tollgates]] were erected\u2014the North Gate and the South Gate.  The section of road north of Crawley, called London Road, was widened in the early 1930s and bypassed a few years later<ref name=\"VCH-Ifield\">{{cite web|url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/Sussex/vol6/pp53-60|title=A History of the County of Sussex: Volume 6 Part 3 \u2013 Bramber Rape (North-Eastern Part) including Crawley New Town.

The tollgate was close to Boscobel House, a 17th-century timber-framed house which is now a [[listed building]], and a long-established coaching inn called the Rising Sun.

Its name derives from the [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary|Sino-Vietnamese]] [[wikt:\u548c\u5e73|\u548c\u5e73]], meaning \"peace.\"\n\nThe province was administered from [[Ch\u1ee3 B\u1edd]] (in [[\u0110\u00e0 B\u1eafc District]]), hence it was also known as \"Ch\u1ee3 B\u1edd Province\", until in November of the same year, it was relocated to [[Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng L\u00e2m District]] (today in [[B\u1ea5t B\u1ea1t District]], [[H\u00e0 T\u00e2y Province]]). In April 1888 it was renamed \"[[Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng L\u00e2m Province]]\" by the French colonial authorities.\n\nOn March 18, 1891, the [[Governor-General of French Indochina]] decreed that the name of the province would change to H\u00f2a B\u00ecnh Province with six districts: [[L\u01b0\u01a1ng S\u01a1n District|L\u01b0\u01a1ng S\u01a1n]], [[K\u1ef3 S\u01a1n District, H\u00f2a B\u00ecnh|K\u1ef3

District|\u0110\u00e0 B\u1eafc]].\n\nOn October 15, 1957, [[T\u00e2n L\u1ea1c District]] was formed from a portion of L\u1ea1c S\u01a1n District.\n\nOn April 17, 1959, [[Kim B\u00f4i District]] was formed from a portion of L\u01b0\u01a1ng S\u01a1n District.\n\nOn August 17, 1964, [[Y\u00ean Th\u1ee7y District]] was formed from a portion of L\u1ea1c Th\u1ee7y District.\n\nOn December 12, 2001, [[Cao Phong District]] was formed from a portion of K\u1ef3 S\u01a1n District.\n\nOn December 17, 2019, K\u1ef3 S\u01a1n District was annexed by the city of [[H\u00f2a B\u00ecnh (city)|H\u00f2a
