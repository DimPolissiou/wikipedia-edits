The group is an important element in the townscape of Dubbo which is an historic centre which relies on tourism and its historic theme. The whole of the railway station group is of very high significance to the development and history of Dubbo and the railway system.<ref name=nswshr-1130/>\n\nDubbo railway station was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1130/>\n\n'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nThis item is assessed as historically rare.

It was the age of truth and perfection. This yuga had no crimes and all humans were kind and friendly. The ''Krita Yuga'' was so named because there was but one religion, and all men were saintly: therefore they were not required to perform religious ceremonies. Humans were long lived, powerfully built, honest, youthful, vigorous, erudite and virtuous. The Vedas were one. All mankind could attain to supreme blessedness. There was no agriculture or mining as the earth yielded those riches on its own. Weather was pleasant and everyone was happy. There were no religious sects. There was no disease, decrepitude or fear of anything.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} Virtue reigns supreme. Human stature was 21 cubits (33 ft 6 inches).

People become slightly diminished compared to their predecessors. Agriculture, labour and mining become existent.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} There was 3 quarter virtue and 1 quarter sin. Normal human stature was 14 cubits (22 ft 4 inches). Average human lifespan was 10,000 years.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n* '''[[Dvapara Yuga]]''': This is the third yuga in order.

Any knowledge you accept is veda, for the teachings of the Vedas are the original knowledge. In the conditioned state, our knowledge is subjected to many deficiencies. The difference between a conditioned soul and a liberated soul is that the conditioned soul has four kinds of defects. The first defect is that he must commit mistakes. ... To err is human. This is one defect of the conditioned soul. Another defect: to be illusioned. Illusion means to accept something which is not: m\u0101y\u0101. M\u0101y\u0101 means \u201cwhat is not.\u201d Everyone is accepting the body as the self. ... But you are not this body. This is illusion. The third defect is the cheating propensity. Everyone has the propensity to cheat others. Although a person is fool number one, he poses himself as very intelligent. Although it is already pointed out that he is in illusion and makes mistakes, he will theorize: \u201cI think this is this, this is this.\u201d But he does not even know his own position. He writes books of philosophy, although he is defective. That is his disease. That is cheating. Lastly, our senses are imperfect. We are very proud of our eyes. Often, someone will challenge, \u201cCan you show me God?\u201d But do you have the eyes to see God? You will never see if you haven\u2019t the eyes. If immediately the room becomes dark, you cannot even see your hands. So what power do you have to see? We cannot, therefore, expect knowledge (veda) with these imperfect senses. With all these deficiencies, in conditioned life we cannot give perfect knowledge to anyone. Nor are we ourselves perfect. Therefore we accept the Vedas as they are.}}</ref> one can compare each yuga's characteristics (human lifespan, dharma, etc.) to the present and historic state of the world and [[empirical evidence|empirically]] deduce which is the current yuga.\n\nFor example, the average human [[life expectancy]] worldwide since the 1700s has been below 80 years.

Any knowledge you accept is veda, for the teachings of the Vedas are the original knowledge. In the conditioned state, our knowledge is subjected to many deficiencies. The difference between a conditioned soul and a liberated soul is that the conditioned soul has four kinds of defects. The first defect is that he must commit mistakes. ... To err is human. This is one defect of the conditioned soul. Another defect: to be illusioned. Illusion means to accept something which is not: m\u0101y\u0101. M\u0101y\u0101 means \u201cwhat is not.\u201d Everyone is accepting the body as the self. ... But you are not this body. This is illusion. The third defect is the cheating propensity. Everyone has the propensity to cheat others. Although a person is fool number one, he poses himself as very intelligent. Although it is already pointed out that he is in illusion and makes mistakes, he will theorize: \u201cI think this is this, this is this.\u201d But he does not even know his own position. He writes books of philosophy, although he is defective. That is his disease. That is cheating. Lastly, our senses are imperfect. We are very proud of our eyes. Often, someone will challenge, \u201cCan you show me God?\u201d But do you have the eyes to see God? You will never see if you haven\u2019t the eyes. If immediately the room becomes dark, you cannot even see your hands. So what power do you have to see? We cannot, therefore, expect knowledge (veda) with these imperfect senses. With all these deficiencies, in conditioned life we cannot give perfect knowledge to anyone. Nor are we ourselves perfect. Therefore we accept the Vedas as they are.}}</ref> one can compare each yuga's characteristics (human lifespan, dharma, etc.) to the present and historic state of the world and [[empirical evidence|empirically]] deduce which is the current yuga.\n\nFor example, the average human [[life expectancy]] worldwide since the 1700s has been below 80 years.

Lacking the money for a bus ticket, he waited for the bus to start and got onto the roof.<ref>Shoaib Akhtar; Anshu Dogra, ''Controversially yours'', [[HarperCollins]] (2011), pp. 42-43</ref> After some struggle, starting his [[List A]] career during the 1993/1994 season and his [[First-class cricket|First-class]] career during the 1994/1995 one, he caught the eye of [[Majid Khan (cricketer, born 1946)|Majid Khan]], then the chief executive of the [[Pakistan Cricket Board|PCB]], and after a good performance for the [[Pakistan A]] team's tour of England, in 1996, he was rewarded his maiden Test cap against the West Indies, in 1997.<ref>Shoaib Akhtar; Anshu Dogra, ''Controversially yours'', [[HarperCollins]] (2011), pp. 58-59</ref>\n\n==International career==\nConsidering his subsequent high profile in cricket, Akhtar's test career started rather modestly. He was first picked to play on his home ground in Rawalpindi during the 2nd Test of the West Indies 1997/98 tour of Pakistan. He was subsequently included in the tour of South Africa during the winter of 1998, where he played in all three Tests. He was notably the spearhead of a depleted Pakistani bowling attack in the Peshawar Test against the visiting Australians later in 1998, where Mark Taylor scored his famous unbeaten 334 in Australia's first innings. Subsequently, after 8 tests and 16 innings, Akhtar had accumulated only 18 wickets.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/player/42655.html |title=Player profile: Shoaib Akhtar |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=7 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nAkhtar's run of average performances started in 1999, during a pre-World Cup series against India. It was followed by high-class bowling performances in [[Sharjah (city)|Sharjah]] and later in the [[1999 Cricket World Cup]].\n\nIn 2002, he was selected for the Pakistan team against [[Australia cricket team|Australia]] and achieved  a small amount of success. However he performed poorly during the [[2003 Cricket World Cup]] and after the tournament he was dropped from the Pakistan squad. \nHe was selected back into the Pakistan squad as they had no choice in the 2004 Test match series against [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]], but struggled in a losing Test series against [[India national cricket team|India]] in 2004. The series ended with a controversy when he left the field citing an injury leading to suspicions by former Pakistan captain, [[Inzamam-ul-Haq]], about his commitment to the team. As a result, his relationship with [[Inzamam-ul-Haq]] and former Pakistan coach [[Bob Woolmer]] deteriorated. A medical panel was set up by the [[Pakistan Cricket Board]] to investigate the nature of his injury, however Pakistan officials dispelled all suspicions.<ref>{{cite web | year = 2004 | url = http://www.cricinfo.com/pakistan/content/story/140776.html | title = Bone scan puts Akhtar in the clear | accessdate = 10 April 2006 }}</ref>\n[[File:Shoaib Akhtar2.jpg|thumb]]\nIn 2005, Akhtar regained his reputation as a fast bowler for his side. Playing in a three Test home series against [[England cricket team|England]], he made a series of impressive bowling performances. His effective use of slower deliveries proved to be unplayable by the English batsmen. Akhtar emerged as the highest wicket taker of the series with seventeen wickets. His comeback was also remarkable as prior to his return, he had been criticised from all corners; such as by the Worcestershire chairman John Elliot for his celebrity attitude and lack of commitment to the team. His performance was also acknowledged by the English captain [[Michael Vaughan]], who remarked \"I thought he (Shoaib) was a big difference between the two teams\".<ref>{{cite web | year = 2004 | url = http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/228332.html | title = Vaughan \u2013 Batsmen to blame | accessdate = 10 April 2006 }}</ref> He is also known as one of only three bowlers to have ever broken the 100&nbsp;mph barrier in cricket history, with a delivery of 100.2&nbsp;mph, during a one-day international against England in World cup 2003<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/149874.html|title=Blink and you'll miss it|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Struggle for form and consistent injuries (2007\u20132009)===\nOn 29 October 2007, Akhtar made his return to cricket, from his 13 match ban and performed well, taking 4 wickets for 43 runs against [[South Africa cricket team|South Africa]] in the fifth and deciding One Day International series in Lahore in Pakistan. Subsequently, he was included in the 16-man Pakistan squad for the [[Pakistani cricket team in India in 2007\u201308|2007 tour of India]].\n\n===Rehabilitation and final years (2010\u20132011)===\nAkhtar made a return to international cricket albeit in the shorter format of the game. In May 2010, PCB named him in a list of 35 probables for the [[2010 Asia Cup|Asia Cup]].

After a poor performance in the 2003 Cricket World Cup, he got involved in a verbal conflict with former Pakistan captain and fast bowler [[Waqar Younis]]. Later on Akhtar was sacked along with other players, including Younis. In a triangular series in 2003 held in Sri Lanka, he was caught [[ball tampering]] making him the second player in cricket to be banned on ball tampering charges. The same year he was banned for one Test match and two One Day International matches for abusing South African spin bowler [[Paul Adams (cricketer)|Paul Adams]], during a match against South Africa.

He was first picked to play on his home ground in Rawalpindi during the 2nd Test of the West Indies 1997/98 tour of Pakistan. He was subsequently included in the tour of South Africa during the winter of 1998, where he played in all three Tests. He was notably the spearhead of a depleted Pakistani bowling attack in the Peshawar Test against the visiting Australians later in 1998, where Mark Taylor scored his famous unbeaten 334 in Australia's first innings. Subsequently, after 8 tests and 16 innings, Akhtar had accumulated only 18 wickets.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/player/42655.html |title=Player profile: Shoaib Akhtar |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=7 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nAkhtar's run of average performances started in 1999, during a pre-World Cup series against India. It was followed by high-class bowling performances in [[Sharjah (city)|Sharjah]] and later in the [[1999 Cricket World Cup]].\n\nIn 2002, he was selected for the Pakistan team against [[Australia cricket team|Australia]] and achieved  a small amount of success. However he performed poorly during the [[2003 Cricket World Cup]] and after the tournament he was dropped from the Pakistan squad. \nHe was selected back into the Pakistan squad as they had no choice in the 2004 Test match series against [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]], but struggled in a losing Test series against [[India national cricket team|India]] in 2004. The series ended with a controversy when he left the field citing an injury leading to suspicions by former Pakistan captain, [[Inzamam-ul-Haq]], about his commitment to the team. As a result, his relationship with [[Inzamam-ul-Haq]] and former Pakistan coach [[Bob Woolmer]] deteriorated. A medical panel was set up by the [[Pakistan Cricket Board]] to investigate the nature of his injury, however Pakistan officials dispelled all suspicions.<ref>{{cite web | year = 2004 | url = http://www.cricinfo.com/pakistan/content/story/140776.html | title = Bone scan puts Akhtar in the clear | accessdate = 10 April 2006 }}</ref>\n[[File:Shoaib Akhtar2.jpg|thumb]]\nIn 2005, Akhtar regained his reputation as a fast bowler for his side. Playing in a three Test home series against [[England cricket team|England]], he made a series of impressive bowling performances. His effective use of slower deliveries proved to be unplayable by the English batsmen. Akhtar emerged as the highest wicket taker of the series with seventeen wickets. His comeback was also remarkable as prior to his return, he had been criticised from all corners; such as by the Worcestershire chairman John Elliot for his celebrity attitude and lack of commitment to the team. His performance was also acknowledged by the English captain [[Michael Vaughan]], who remarked \"I thought he (Shoaib) was a big difference between the two teams\".<ref>{{cite web | year = 2004 | url = http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/228332.html | title = Vaughan \u2013 Batsmen to blame | accessdate = 10 April 2006 }}</ref> He is also known as one of only three bowlers to have ever broken the 100&nbsp;mph barrier in cricket history, with a delivery of 100.2&nbsp;mph, during a one-day international against England in World cup 2003<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/149874.html|title=Blink and you'll miss it|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Struggle for form and consistent injuries (2007\u20132009)===\nOn 29 October 2007, Akhtar made his return to cricket, from his 13 match ban and performed well, taking 4 wickets for 43 runs against [[South Africa cricket team|South Africa]] in the fifth and deciding One Day International series in Lahore in Pakistan. Subsequently, he was included in the 16-man Pakistan squad for the [[Pakistani cricket team in India in 2007\u201308|2007 tour of India]].\n\n===Rehabilitation and final years (2010\u20132011)===\nAkhtar made a return to international cricket albeit in the shorter format of the game.

After a poor performance in the 2003 Cricket World Cup, he got involved in a verbal conflict with former Pakistan captain and fast bowler [[Waqar Younis]]. Later on Akhtar was sacked along with other players, including Younis. In a triangular series in 2003 held in Sri Lanka, he was caught [[ball tampering]] making him the second player in cricket to be banned on ball tampering charges. The same year he was banned for one Test match and two One Day International matches for abusing South African spin bowler [[Paul Adams (cricketer)|Paul Adams]], during a match against South Africa.

The game features a single player (the \"1\") competing against 100 other contestants (known as \"the Mob\") in a trivia match. The 1 earns prize money depending on how many Mob members he or she has eliminated from the game, but loses all winnings with an incorrect answer at any point. The host of the original NBC version was [[Bob Saget]], while [[Carrie Ann Inaba]] hosted the GSN revival.\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe game is played with the main contestant acting as the \"1\" answering questions against 100 other people collectively known as the \"Mob\", for the top prize of $1,000,000 ($50,000 or $100,000 in the GSN revival). The contestant's goal must be the last player standing, and by eliminating all 100 members of the Mob by correctly answering general-knowledge questions in succession.<ref name=\"Stanley\"/>\n\nTo begin the game, a multiple-choice question is revealed with three options, with one being the correct answer. Once all of the Mob members have locked in their answers, the contestant is given the opportunity to answer the question. If the contestant is correct, all Mob members who answered incorrectly are eliminated from the game, bringing the \"1\" closer to winning the game. The amount of money in the contestant's bank also increases by an amount dependent on the number of mob members eliminated in that question (season 1), or at a level per every 10 mobs eliminated (season 2). If the contestant eliminates all 100 mob members, his or her winnings was augmented to the top prize . \n\nAfter every correct answer, the contestant is given the choice to either walk away with the money he or she has earned or continue playing. In conjunction with the various changes made in the sixth episode, the contestant could now only walk away after correctly answering the third question, the fifth question, and every question thereafter. If the \"1\" continues and misses the question, the game ends and the contestant won nothing, while any surviving Mob members who answered the last question correctly evenly split the \"1\"'s winnings accumulated up to that point in the game.<ref name=\"Stanley\"/>\n\n===Helps===\nTo assist the main contestant, assistance from the mob is offered in the form of \"helps\". Originally there were two helps, which could only be used in order.<ref name=\"NBC1Premiere\">{{cite episode|series=1 vs. 100|season=1|number=1|network=NBC|date=October 13, 2006}}</ref> Starting with the sixth episode, a third option was added, the three helps were given names, and contestants could choose any of the three at any point in the game. The helps were, in order:<ref name=\"NBC Rules\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nbc.com/Casting/Applications/1v100_rules.pdf|title=''1 vs 100'' Official Rules|work=NBC.com|publisher=NBC Universal|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070422021424/http://www.nbc.com/Casting/Applications/1v100_rules.pdf|archivedate=April 22, 2007}}</ref>\n\n*\"Poll The Mob\": Originally known as the first help, the contestant selects one of the three answers to get more information about. The number of Mob members who chose that answer is revealed, and the contestant chooses one of the revealed mob members to discuss his or her response.<ref name=\"NBC1Premiere\"/>\n*\"Ask The Mob\": Originally known as the second help, two Mob members are randomly selected: one who answered correctly and one who answered incorrectly. Each explains his or her decision to the contestant, which in turn eliminates the third choice from consideration.<ref name=\"NBC1Premiere\"/>\n*\"Trust The Mob\" (added in episode six): The contestant is automatically committed to the answer chosen most frequently by the Mob.<ref name=\"Season1Ep6\">{{Cite episode|series=1 vs. 100|network=NBC|date=December 1, 2006|season=1|number=6}}</ref>\n\nAfter reaching a certain point in the game, contestants can be given a \"Sneak Peek\" which allows the contestant to see their next question (but not the three answers) before deciding whether or not to answer the next question. In season one, it was used when a player eliminated 90 or more members of the mob;<ref name=\"NBC Rules\"/> it eventually became available once a contestant used all his or her helps in season two.<ref>{{cite episode|series=1 vs. 100|network=NBC|date=January 25, 2008|season=2|number=4}}</ref>\n\n===Payout structure===\nOriginally, contestants were awarded a cumulative amount of money after each individual question for each Mob member eliminated; this amount increased with each question as the game went on. For example, a contestant who eliminated eight Mob members on his or her second question would be awarded $500 per member, adding up to $4,000 to add to his or her total.<ref name=\"NBC1Premiere\"/> The payout structure was tweaked slightly prior to the third episode of the season<ref name=\"Season1Ep3\">{{Cite episode|series=1 vs. 100|network=NBC|date=October 27, 2006|season=1|number=3}}</ref> and changed once again on the sixth episode in conjunction with introduction of the \"Trust the Mob\" help.<ref name=\"NBC Rules\"/><ref name=\"Season1Ep6\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Question\n! colspan=\"3\"| Value\n|-\n!

Once all of the Mob members have locked in their answers, the contestant is given the opportunity to answer the question. If the contestant is correct, all Mob members who answered incorrectly are eliminated from the game, bringing the \"1\" closer to winning the game. The amount of money in the contestant's bank also increases by an amount dependent on the number of mob members eliminated in that question (season 1), or at a level per every 10 mobs eliminated (season 2). If the contestant eliminates all 100 mob members, his or her winnings was augmented to the top prize . \n\nAfter every correct answer, the contestant is given the choice to either walk away with the money he or she has earned or continue playing. In conjunction with the various changes made in the sixth episode, the contestant could now only walk away after correctly answering the third question, the fifth question, and every question thereafter. If the \"1\" continues and misses the question, the game ends and the contestant won nothing, while any surviving Mob members who answered the last question correctly evenly split the \"1\"'s winnings accumulated up to that point in the game.<ref name=\"Stanley\"/>\n\n===Helps===\nTo assist the main contestant, assistance from the mob is offered in the form of \"helps\". Originally there were two helps, which could only be used in order.<ref name=\"NBC1Premiere\">{{cite episode|series=1 vs. 100|season=1|number=1|network=NBC|date=October 13, 2006}}</ref> Starting with the sixth episode, a third option was added, the three helps were given names, and contestants could choose any of the three at any point in the game. The helps were, in order:<ref name=\"NBC Rules\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nbc.com/Casting/Applications/1v100_rules.pdf|title=''1 vs 100'' Official Rules|work=NBC.com|publisher=NBC Universal|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070422021424/http://www.nbc.com/Casting/Applications/1v100_rules.pdf|archivedate=April 22, 2007}}</ref>\n\n*\"Poll The Mob\": Originally known as the first help, the contestant selects one of the three answers to get more information about. The number of Mob members who chose that answer is revealed, and the contestant chooses one of the revealed mob members to discuss his or her response.<ref name=\"NBC1Premiere\"/>\n*\"Ask The Mob\": Originally known as the second help, two Mob members are randomly selected: one who answered correctly and one who answered incorrectly. Each explains his or her decision to the contestant, which in turn eliminates the third choice from consideration.<ref name=\"NBC1Premiere\"/>\n*\"Trust The Mob\" (added in episode six): The contestant is automatically committed to the answer chosen most frequently by the Mob.<ref name=\"Season1Ep6\">{{Cite episode|series=1 vs. 100|network=NBC|date=December 1, 2006|season=1|number=6}}</ref>\n\nAfter reaching a certain point in the game, contestants can be given a \"Sneak Peek\" which allows the contestant to see their next question (but not the three answers) before deciding whether or not to answer the next question. In season one, it was used when a player eliminated 90 or more members of the mob;<ref name=\"NBC Rules\"/> it eventually became available once a contestant used all his or her helps in season two.<ref>{{cite episode|series=1 vs. 100|network=NBC|date=January 25, 2008|season=2|number=4}}</ref>\n\n===Payout structure===\nOriginally, contestants were awarded a cumulative amount of money after each individual question for each Mob member eliminated; this amount increased with each question as the game went on. For example, a contestant who eliminated eight Mob members on his or her second question would be awarded $500 per member, adding up to $4,000 to add to his or her total.<ref name=\"NBC1Premiere\"/> The payout structure was tweaked slightly prior to the third episode of the season<ref name=\"Season1Ep3\">{{Cite episode|series=1 vs. 100|network=NBC|date=October 27, 2006|season=1|number=3}}</ref> and changed once again on the sixth episode in conjunction with introduction of the \"Trust the Mob\" help.<ref name=\"NBC Rules\"/><ref name=\"Season1Ep6\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Question\n! colspan=\"3\"| Value\n|-\n!

This [[musket]] was used in the era of the expansion of the [[British Empire]] and acquired symbolic importance at least as significant as its physical importance. It was in use for over a hundred years with many incremental changes in its [[design]]. These versions include the Long Land Pattern, the Short Land Pattern, the India Pattern, the New Land Pattern Musket and the Sea Service Musket.\n\nThe Long Land Pattern musket and its derivatives, all 0.75 inch [[Calibre|caliber]] flintlock muskets, were the standard [[long gun]]s of the [[British Empire]]'s land forces from 1722 until 1838, when they were superseded by a [[percussion cap]] [[smoothbore]] musket. The [[Glossary of British ordnance terms|British Ordnance System]] converted many [[flintlock]]s into the new [[Caplock mechanism|percussion system]] known as the Pattern 1839 Musket. A fire in 1841 at the [[Tower of London]] destroyed many muskets before they could be converted. Still, the Brown Bess saw service until the middle of the nineteenth century.\n\nMost male citizens of the [[British America|American Colonies]] were required by law to own arms and [[ammunition]] for [[militia]] duty.<ref>{{cite web |last=Linder |first=Doug |title=United States vs. Miller (U.S. 1939) |work=Exploring Constitutional Law |publisher=University of Missouri-Kansas City Law School |year=2008 |url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/millervus.html |accessdate=26 July 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011123170327/http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/millervus.html |archive-date=23 November 2001 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Long Land Pattern was a common [[firearm]] in use by both sides in the [[American War of Independence]].<ref>Neumann, George.

Brown Besses saw service in the [[First Opium War]] and during the [[Indian rebellion of 1857]]. [[Zulu people|Zulu warriors]], who had also purchased them from European traders, used them during the [[Anglo-Zulu War]] in 1879. One was even used in the [[Battle of Shiloh]] in 1862.<ref>Brown, Dee Alexander. ''The Bold Cavaliers''. (1959) p. 50.</ref>\n\n==Origins of the name==\nOne hypothesis is that the '''\"Brown Bess\"''' was named after [[Elizabeth I of England]], but this lacks support. Jonathan Ferguson, Firearms Curator of the [[Royal Armouries]], traces the name to at least the 1760s, and his research suggests the name was adopted for slang for a lowly woman, [[mistress (lover)|mistress]], or [[prostitute]] who also appear in period sources referred to as \"Brown Bess.\" He writes, \"'Bess' was a [[generic term|generic]] and sometimes [[derogatory]] name, a bit like 'Sheila' in modern [[Australian English]],\" and \"brown\" simply meant plain or drab. Ferguson discounts, with evidence, many of the other theories previously popular.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://royalarmouries.org/stories/our-collection/brown-bess-musket-or-mistress/|title=History of the term 'Brown Bess' {{!}} Royal Armouries|date=2017-05-17|work=Royal Armouries|access-date=2018-11-16|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nEarly uses of the term include the [[newspaper]], the ''[[The Hartford Courant|Connecticut Courant]]'' in April 1771, which said \"...&nbsp;but if you are afraid of the sea, take Brown Bess on your shoulder and march.\" This familiar use indicates widespread use of the term by that time. The 1785 ''Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue'', a contemporary work that defined vernacular and [[Slang|slang terms]], contained this entry: \"Brown Bess: A soldier's firelock. To hug Brown Bess; to carry a fire-lock, or serve as a private soldier.\" [[Military]] and [[government]] records of the time do not use this poetical name but refer to ''firelocks'', ''flintlock'', ''muskets'' or by the weapon's model designations.[[File:Officer and Serjeant of a Highland Regiment.jpg|thumb|left|Soldiers of the [[42nd Regiment of Foot|Black Watch]] armed with a musket (Brown Bess) and a [[halberd]], circa 1790]]\n\nPopular explanations of the use of the word \"Brown\" include that it was a reference to either the colour of the [[walnut]] [[Stock (firearm)|stocks]], or to the characteristic brown colour that was produced by russeting, an early form of [[metal]] treatment. However, in the case of russeting at least, the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] (OED) and Ferguson note that \"[[Browning (steel)|browning]]\" was only introduced in the early 19th century, well after the term had come into general use.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://royalarmouries.org/stories/our-collection/brown-bess-musket-or-mistress/|title=History of the term 'Brown Bess' {{!}} Royal Armouries|date=2017-05-17|work=Royal Armouries|access-date=2018-11-16|language=en-GB}}</ref> Others argue that mass-produced weapons of the time were coated in brown [[varnish]] on metal parts as a rust preventative and on [[wood]] as a sealer (or in the case of unscrupulous [[General contractor|contractor]]s, to disguise inferior or non-regulation types of wood), an entirely different thing from russeting.\n\nSimilarly, the word \"Bess\" is commonly held to either derive from the word ''[[arquebus]]'' or ''[[blunderbuss]]'' (predecessors of the musket) or to be a reference to Elizabeth I, possibly given to commemorate her death. The OED has citations for \"brown musket\" dating back to the early 18th century that refer to the same weapon. Another suggestion is that the name is simply the counterpart to the earlier [[Bill (weapon)|Brown Bill]].\n[[image:Brown Bess.png|thumb|right|400px|A modern reproduction of the Short Land Pattern Musket]]\nHowever, the origin of the name may be much simpler, if vulgar.\n\n{{poemquote|In the days of lace-ruffles, perukes, and brocade\nBrown Bess was a partner whom none could despise\u2013\nAn out-spoken, flinty-lipped, brazen-faced jade,\nWith a habit of looking men straight in the eyes\u2013\nAt [[Battle of Blenheim|Blenheim]] and [[Battle of Ramillies|Ramillies]], fops would confess\nThey were pierced to the heart by the charms of Brown Bess ...|sign=[[Rudyard Kipling]], \"Brown Bess\", 1911}}\n\nKipling may have based his poem on an earlier but similar \"Brown Bess\" poem published in \"Flights of Fancy\" (No. 16) in 1792. Of course, the name could have been initially inspired by the older term of the \"Brown Bill\" and perhaps the barrels were originally varnished brown, but it is well known in literary circles that the name \"Brown Bess\" during the period in question in the 17th to early 19th centuries is not a reference to a color or a weapon but to simply refer to a wanton prostitute [or harlot].<ref>A Dictionary of Sexual Language and Imagery in Shakespearean and Stuart Literature, Gordon Williams (1994) pgs 102-103</ref> Such a nickname would have been a delight to the soldiers of the era who were from the lower classes of English and then British society.

Firearms were individually procured by officers or [[regiment]]s as late as 1745, and were often custom-made to the tastes of the purchaser. As the firearm gained ascendancy on the [[battlefield]], this lack of [[standardisation]] led to increasing difficulties in the supply of [[ammunition]] and repair materials. To address these difficulties, armies began to adopt standardised \"patterns\". A military service selected a \"pattern musket\" to be stored in a \"pattern room\". There it served as a reference for [[Gunsmith|arms maker]]s, who could make comparisons and take measurements to ensure that their products matched the standard.\n\nStress-bearing parts of the Brown Bess, such as the [[Gun barrel|barrel]], [[Mechanism (engineering)|lockwork]], and [[Sling (firearms)|sling]]-[[swivel]]s, were customarily made of [[iron]], while other furniture pieces such as the butt plate, [[trigger guard]] and ramrod pipe were found in both iron and [[brass]]. It weighed around {{convert|10|lb|kg}} and it could be fitted with a 17-inch (432&nbsp;mm) [[Multiview projection|triangular cross-section]] [[bayonet]]. The weapon did not have [[Open sights|sights]], although the [[bayonet lug]] doubled as a crude front sight.\n\nThe earliest models had iron fittings, but these were replaced by brass in models built after 1736. Wooden [[Ramrod|scouring stick]]s were used with the first guns but were replaced by iron ones, although guns with wooden scouring sticks were still issued to troops on American service until 1765 and later to [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|loyalist]] units in the [[American Revolution]]. Wooden scouring sticks were also used in the [[Dragoon]] version produced from 1744\u20141771 for [[Navy]] and [[Marines|Marine]] use.\n\nThe [[Accuracy and precision|accuracy]] of the Brown Bess was fair, as with most other muskets. In 1811, in [[London]], a test [[shooting]] was conducted at the site. The [[Shooting target|target]] was a wooden [[shield]] the size of an [[infantry]] or a [[cavalry]] line. The results of the practice were as follows: at a distance of 100 yards (91.44 m) 53% hits, 200 yards (182.88 m) 30% hits, 300 yards (274.32 m) 23% hits. We can say that the accuracy of the Brown Bess was in line with most other smoothbore muskets of the 18th to 19th centuries. But it should be borne in mind that this is the result of shooting by ordinary soldiers who had a very low [[Military education and training|training]]. Soldiers of [[Light infantry]] had a more severe training and were taught accurate shooting, even in single target.<ref>British Light Infantry and Rifle Tactics of the Napoleonic Wars</ref>\n\nIt is also worth considering that in battle, soldiers suffered [[fear]], [[fatigue]] and [[stress (biology)|stress]], which led to a decrease in accuracy.\n\nThe Brown Bess was used not only in the [[Line infantry]], but also [[Light infantry]]. As well as [[Rogers' Rangers]], hunters, [[Skirmisher]], [[Indigenous Americans|Indians]] and many other [[Irregular military|irregular troops]] who used non-standard [[Military tactics|tactics]].\n\nThere is no doubt that the Brown Bess's bullet was lethal at its full range of effective fire. In the mid-18th century, Robertson measured the speed of musket bullets on a ballistic [[pendulum]]. According to him, the speed of a round musket bullet [[Slug (unit)|slug]] was about 1804.462 feet per second (550&nbsp;m/s). That is, the [[muzzle (firearms)|muzzle]] [[energy]] of the musket was about 3,500 to 4,000 [[joules]], which is comparable to the energy of modern [[rifle cartridge]]s. Modern [[Ballistics|ballistic]] tests have confirmed these data.<ref>https://journals.lib.unb.ca/index.php/MCR/article/view/17669/22312#no10</ref>\nAccording to the Russian Lieutenant-General Ivan G. Gogel, all the muskets of the [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Europe|European nations]], was able to penetrate a wooden [[shield]] with a thickness of 1 inch (2.54&nbsp;cm), at a distance of 300 yards.<ref>https://search.rsl.ru/ru/record/01002987782</ref>\n\nBritish soldiers armed with Brown Besses preferred to reduce the standard procedures for loading a musket. To do this, they lower the [[Paper cartridge|cartridge]] into the barrel and hit the butt on the ground. This made it possible to do without the use of a scouring stick. This method of loading allowed to increase the rate of fire approximately twice.<ref>Thomas Anburey. \"Here I cannot help observing to you, whether it proceeded from an idea of self-preservation, or natural instinct, but the soldiers greatly improved the mode they were taught in, as to expedition. For as soon as they had primed their pieces and put the [[Paper cartridge|cartridge]] into the barrel, instead of [scouring] ramming it down with their scouring sticks, they struck the butt plate of the piece upon the ground, and bringing it to the present, fired it off.\u201d</ref>\n\n===Variations===\n[[File:Buck&Ball musket StormWreck.jpg|thumb|X-ray of a Brown Bess musket recovered by [[St. Augustine Light#Lighthouse Archaeological Maritime Program (LAMP)|LAMP]] archaeologists from an American Revolutionary War era shipwreck lost in December 1782. It is believed to be a 1769 Short Land Pattern, and is loaded with [[buck and ball]]]]\n\nMany variations and modifications of the standard pattern musket were created over its long history. The earliest version was the Long Land Pattern of 1722, a 62-inch (1,575&nbsp;mm) long (without bayonet) and with a 46-inch (1,168&nbsp;mm) barrel. It was later found that shortening the barrel did not detract from accuracy but made handling easier, giving rise to the Militia (or Marine) Pattern of 1756 and the Short Land Pattern of 1768, which both had a 42-inch (1,067&nbsp;mm) barrel. Another version with a 39-inch (991&nbsp;mm) barrel was first manufactured for the [[British East India Company]], and was eventually adopted by the British Army in 1790 as the India Pattern.\n\nTowards the end of the life of the weapon, there was a change in the system of ignition. The [[flintlock mechanism]], which was prone to misfiring, especially in [[Moisture content|wet weather]], was replaced by the more reliable percussion cap. The last flintlock pattern manufactured was selected for conversion to the new system as the Pattern 1839. As a fire at the Tower of London destroyed large stocks of these in 1841, a new Pattern 1842 musket was manufactured. These remained in service until the outbreak of the [[Crimean War]] when they were replaced by the [[Mini\u00e9 rifle|Mini\u00e9]] and the [[P53 Enfield]] [[rifled musket]].\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left; width:10%;\"|Pattern\n! style=\"text-align:left; width:25%;\"|Picture\n! style=\"text-align:left; width:20%;\"|In service\n! style=\"text-align:left; width:15%;\"|Barrel Length\n! style=\"text-align:left; width:15%;\"|Overall Length\n! style=\"text-align:left; width:15%;\"|Weight\n|-\n|Long Land Pattern || [[File:Long Land Pattern.jpg|300px]] || 1722 \u2014 1793<br>standard Infantry Musket 1722 \u2014 1768<br>(supplemented by Short Land Pattern from 1768) || {{convert|46|in|mm|adj=on}} || {{convert|62.5|in|mm|adj=on}} || {{convert|10.4|lb|kg}}\n|-\n|Short Land Pattern || [[File:Short Land Pattern.jpg|300px]] || 1740 \u2014 1797<br>1740 (Dragoons)<br>1768 (Infantry)<br>standard Infantry Musket 1793 \u2014 1797 || {{convert|42|in|mm|adj=on}} || {{convert|58.5|in|mm|adj=on}} || {{convert|10.5|lb|kg}}\n|-\n|India Pattern || [[File:India 3rd Pattern Brown Bess.jpg|300px]] || 1797 \u2014 1854<br>standard Infantry Musket 1797 \u2014 1854<br>(Some in use pre-1797 purchased from the East India Company for use in Egypt) || {{convert|39|in|mm|adj=on}} || {{convert|55.25|in|mm|adj=on}} || {{convert|9.68|lb|kg}}\n|-\n|New Land Pattern || [[File:New Land Pattern.jpg|300px]] || 1802 \u2014 1854<br>Issued only to the Foot Guards and 4th Regiment of Foot || {{convert|39|in|mm|adj=on}} || {{convert|55.5|in|mm|adj=on}} || {{convert|10.06|lb|kg}}\n|-\n|New Light Infantry Land Pattern || The detail differences between this musket and the standard New Land Pattern were a scrolled trigger guard similar to that of the [[Baker Rifle]] except more rounded, a browned barrel and a notch back-sight, the bayonet lug being used as the fore-sight.\n || 1811 \u2014 1854<br>Issued only to the 43rd, 51st, 52nd, 68th, 71st and 85th [[Light Infantry]] and the Battalions of the 60th Foot not armed with rifles || {{convert|39|in|mm|adj=on}} || {{convert|55.5|in|mm|adj=on}} || {{convert|10.06|lb|kg}}\n|-\n|Cavalry Carbine || [[File:Brown Bess Carbine.jpg|300px]] || 1796 \u2014 1838<br>Issued to cavalry units || {{convert|26|in|mm|adj=on}} || {{convert|42.5|in|mm|adj=on}} || {{convert|7.37|lb|kg}}\n|-\n|Sea Service Pattern || [[File:Sea Pattern Brown Bess.jpg|300px]] || 1778 \u2014 1854<br>Issued to Royal Navy ships, drawn by men as required, Marines used Sea Service weapons when deployed as part of a ship's company but were issued India Pattern weapons when serving ashore || {{convert|37|in|mm|adj=on}} || {{convert|53.5|in|mm|adj=on}} || {{convert|9.00|lb|kg}}\n|-\n|}\n\n==See also==\n{{Wikisource1911Enc|Brown Bess}}\n* [[British military rifles]]\n* [[List of wars involving England]]\n* [[List of wars involving Great Britain]]\n* [[List of wars involving the United Kingdom]]\n* [[Military history of England]]\n* [[Military history of Britain]]\n* [[Military history of the United Kingdom]]\n* [[British Armed Forces]]\n* [[United Kingdom Special Forces]]\n* [[Charleville musket]]\n* [[Potzdam Musket|Potzdam musket]]\n* [[Jezail]]\n* [[M1752 Musket|Spanish Model 1752 Musket]]\n* [[Springfield musket]]\n* [[Musket]]\n* [[Rifle]]\n* [[Carbine]]\n* [[Pistoleer]]\n* [[Historical reenactment]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Other references==\n* Cumpston, Mike. \"The Guns of Empire: 18th Century Martial Muskets\" ''Guns Magazine'', August 2008, p.&nbsp;60.

This [[musket]] was used in the era of the expansion of the [[British Empire]] and acquired symbolic importance at least as significant as its physical importance. It was in use for over a hundred years with many incremental changes in its [[design]]. These versions include the Long Land Pattern, the Short Land Pattern, the India Pattern, the New Land Pattern Musket and the Sea Service Musket.\n\nThe Long Land Pattern musket and its derivatives, all 0.75 inch [[Calibre|caliber]] flintlock muskets, were the standard [[long gun]]s of the [[British Empire]]'s land forces from 1722 until 1838, when they were superseded by a [[percussion cap]] [[smoothbore]] musket. The [[Glossary of British ordnance terms|British Ordnance System]] converted many [[flintlock]]s into the new [[Caplock mechanism|percussion system]] known as the Pattern 1839 Musket. A fire in 1841 at the [[Tower of London]] destroyed many muskets before they could be converted. Still, the Brown Bess saw service until the middle of the nineteenth century.\n\nMost male citizens of the [[British America|American Colonies]] were required by law to own arms and [[ammunition]] for [[militia]] duty.<ref>{{cite web |last=Linder |first=Doug |title=United States vs. Miller (U.S. 1939) |work=Exploring Constitutional Law |publisher=University of Missouri-Kansas City Law School |year=2008 |url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/millervus.html |accessdate=26 July 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011123170327/http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/millervus.html |archive-date=23 November 2001 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Long Land Pattern was a common [[firearm]] in use by both sides in the [[American War of Independence]].<ref>Neumann, George.

Brown Besses saw service in the [[First Opium War]] and during the [[Indian rebellion of 1857]]. [[Zulu people|Zulu warriors]], who had also purchased them from European traders, used them during the [[Anglo-Zulu War]] in 1879. One was even used in the [[Battle of Shiloh]] in 1862.<ref>Brown, Dee Alexander. ''The Bold Cavaliers''. (1959) p. 50.</ref>\n\n==Origins of the name==\nOne hypothesis is that the '''\"Brown Bess\"''' was named after [[Elizabeth I of England]], but this lacks support. Jonathan Ferguson, Firearms Curator of the [[Royal Armouries]], traces the name to at least the 1760s, and his research suggests the name was adopted for slang for a lowly woman, [[mistress (lover)|mistress]], or [[prostitute]] who also appear in period sources referred to as \"Brown Bess.\" He writes, \"'Bess' was a [[generic term|generic]] and sometimes [[derogatory]] name, a bit like 'Sheila' in modern [[Australian English]],\" and \"brown\" simply meant plain or drab. Ferguson discounts, with evidence, many of the other theories previously popular.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://royalarmouries.org/stories/our-collection/brown-bess-musket-or-mistress/|title=History of the term 'Brown Bess' {{!}} Royal Armouries|date=2017-05-17|work=Royal Armouries|access-date=2018-11-16|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nEarly uses of the term include the [[newspaper]], the ''[[The Hartford Courant|Connecticut Courant]]'' in April 1771, which said \"...&nbsp;but if you are afraid of the sea, take Brown Bess on your shoulder and march.\" This familiar use indicates widespread use of the term by that time. The 1785 ''Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue'', a contemporary work that defined vernacular and [[Slang|slang terms]], contained this entry: \"Brown Bess: A soldier's firelock. To hug Brown Bess; to carry a fire-lock, or serve as a private soldier.\" [[Military]] and [[government]] records of the time do not use this poetical name but refer to ''firelocks'', ''flintlock'', ''muskets'' or by the weapon's model designations.[[File:Officer and Serjeant of a Highland Regiment.jpg|thumb|left|Soldiers of the [[42nd Regiment of Foot|Black Watch]] armed with a musket (Brown Bess) and a [[halberd]], circa 1790]]\n\nPopular explanations of the use of the word \"Brown\" include that it was a reference to either the colour of the [[walnut]] [[Stock (firearm)|stocks]], or to the characteristic brown colour that was produced by russeting, an early form of [[metal]] treatment. However, in the case of russeting at least, the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] (OED) and Ferguson note that \"[[Browning (steel)|browning]]\" was only introduced in the early 19th century, well after the term had come into general use.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://royalarmouries.org/stories/our-collection/brown-bess-musket-or-mistress/|title=History of the term 'Brown Bess' {{!}} Royal Armouries|date=2017-05-17|work=Royal Armouries|access-date=2018-11-16|language=en-GB}}</ref> Others argue that mass-produced weapons of the time were coated in brown [[varnish]] on metal parts as a rust preventative and on [[wood]] as a sealer (or in the case of unscrupulous [[General contractor|contractor]]s, to disguise inferior or non-regulation types of wood), an entirely different thing from russeting.\n\nSimilarly, the word \"Bess\" is commonly held to either derive from the word ''[[arquebus]]'' or ''[[blunderbuss]]'' (predecessors of the musket) or to be a reference to Elizabeth I, possibly given to commemorate her death. The OED has citations for \"brown musket\" dating back to the early 18th century that refer to the same weapon. Another suggestion is that the name is simply the counterpart to the earlier [[Bill (weapon)|Brown Bill]].\n[[image:Brown Bess.png|thumb|right|400px|A modern reproduction of the Short Land Pattern Musket \u2013 [[prototype]], hence no bayonet lug]]\nHowever, the origin of the name may be much simpler, if vulgar.\n\n{{poemquote|In the days of lace-ruffles, perukes, and brocade\nBrown Bess was a partner whom none could despise\u2013\nAn out-spoken, flinty-lipped, brazen-faced jade,\nWith a habit of looking men straight in the eyes\u2013\nAt [[Battle of Blenheim|Blenheim]] and [[Battle of Ramillies|Ramillies]], fops would confess\nThey were pierced to the heart by the charms of Brown Bess ...|sign=[[Rudyard Kipling]], \"Brown Bess\", 1911}}\n\nKipling may have based his poem on an earlier but similar \"Brown Bess\" poem published in \"Flights of Fancy\" (No. 16) in 1792. Of course, the name could have been initially inspired by the older term of the \"Brown Bill\" and perhaps the barrels were originally varnished brown, but it is well known in literary circles that the name \"Brown Bess\" during the period in question in the 17th to early 19th centuries is not a reference to a color or a weapon but to simply refer to a wanton prostitute [or harlot].<ref>A Dictionary of Sexual Language and Imagery in Shakespearean and Stuart Literature, Gordon Williams (1994) pgs 102-103</ref> Such a nickname would have been a delight to the soldiers of the era who were from the lower classes of English and then British society. So far, the earliest use noted so far of the term \"Brown Bess\" was in a 1631 publication, John Done's \"POLYDORON: OR A Mescellania of Morall, Philosophicall, and Theological Sentences.\" at Page 152:\n\n{{quote|Things profferd and easie to come by, diminish themselves in reputation & price: for how full of pangs and dotage is a wayling lover, for it may bee some browne bessie?

Firearms were individually procured by officers or [[regiment]]s as late as 1745, and were often custom-made to the tastes of the purchaser. As the firearm gained ascendancy on the [[battlefield]], this lack of [[standardisation]] led to increasing difficulties in the supply of [[ammunition]] and repair materials. To address these difficulties, armies began to adopt standardised \"patterns\". A military service selected a \"pattern musket\" to be stored in a \"pattern room\". There it served as a reference for [[Gunsmith|arms maker]]s, who could make comparisons and take measurements to ensure that their products matched the standard.\n\nStress-bearing parts of the Brown Bess, such as the [[Gun barrel|barrel]], [[Mechanism (engineering)|lockwork]], and [[Sling (firearms)|sling]]-[[swivel]]s, were customarily made of [[iron]], while other furniture pieces such as the butt plate, [[trigger guard]] and ramrod pipe were found in both iron and [[brass]]. It weighed around {{convert|10|lb|kg}} and it could be fitted with a 17-inch (432&nbsp;mm) [[Multiview projection|triangular cross-section]] [[bayonet]]. The weapon did not have [[Open sights|sights]], although the [[bayonet lug]] doubled as a crude front sight.\n\nThe earliest models had iron fittings, but these were replaced by brass in models built after 1736. Wooden [[Ramrod|scouring stick]]s were used with the first guns but were replaced by iron ones, although guns with wooden scouring sticks were still issued to troops on American service until 1765 and later to [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|loyalist]] units in the [[American Revolution]]. Wooden scouring sticks were also used in the [[Dragoon]] version produced from 1744\u20141771 for [[Navy]] and [[Marines|Marine]] use.\n\nThe [[Accuracy and precision|accuracy]] of the Brown Bess was fair, as with most other muskets. In 1811, in [[London]], a test [[shooting]] was conducted at the site. The [[Shooting target|target]] was a wooden [[shield]] the size of an [[infantry]] or a [[cavalry]] line. The results of the practice were as follows: at a distance of 100 yards (91.44 m) 53% hits, 200 yards (182.88 m) 30% hits, 300 yards (274.32 m) 23% hits. We can say that the accuracy of the Brown Bess was in line with most other smoothbore muskets of the 18th to 19th centuries. But it should be borne in mind that this is the result of shooting by ordinary soldiers who had a very low [[Military education and training|training]]. Soldiers of [[Light infantry]] had a more severe training and were taught accurate shooting, even in single target.<ref>British Light Infantry and Rifle Tactics of the Napoleonic Wars</ref>\n\nIt is also worth considering that in battle, soldiers suffered [[fear]], [[fatigue]] and [[stress (biology)|stress]], which led to a decrease in accuracy.\n\nThe Brown Bess was used not only in the [[Line infantry]], but also [[Light infantry]]. As well as [[Rogers' Rangers]], hunters, [[Skirmisher]], [[Indigenous Americans|Indians]] and many other [[Irregular military|irregular troops]] who used non-standard [[Military tactics|tactics]].\n\nThere is no doubt that the Brown Bess's bullet was lethal at its full range of effective fire. In the mid-18th century, Robertson measured the speed of musket bullets on a ballistic [[pendulum]]. According to him, the speed of a round musket bullet [[Slug (unit)|slug]] was about 1804.462 feet per second (550&nbsp;m/s). That is, the [[muzzle (firearms)|muzzle]] [[energy]] of the musket was about 3,500 to 4,000 [[joules]], which is comparable to the energy of modern [[rifle cartridge]]s. Modern [[Ballistics|ballistic]] tests have confirmed these data.<ref>https://journals.lib.unb.ca/index.php/MCR/article/view/17669/22312#no10</ref>\nAccording to the Russian Lieutenant-General Ivan G. Gogel, all the muskets of the [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Europe|European nations]], was able to penetrate a wooden [[shield]] with a thickness of 1 inch (2.54&nbsp;cm), at a distance of 300 yards.<ref>https://search.rsl.ru/ru/record/01002987782</ref>\n\nBritish soldiers armed with Brown Besses preferred to reduce the standard procedures for loading a musket. To do this, they lower the [[Paper cartridge|cartridge]] into the barrel and hit the butt on the ground. This made it possible to do without the use of a scouring stick. This method of loading allowed to increase the rate of fire approximately twice.<ref>Thomas Anburey. \"Here I cannot help observing to you, whether it proceeded from an idea of self-preservation, or natural instinct, but the soldiers greatly improved the mode they were taught in, as to expedition. For as soon as they had primed their pieces and put the [[Paper cartridge|cartridge]] into the barrel, instead of [scouring] ramming it down with their scouring sticks, they struck the butt plate of the piece upon the ground, and bringing it to the present, fired it off.\u201d</ref>\n\n===Variations===\n[[File:Buck&Ball musket StormWreck.jpg|thumb|X-ray of a Brown Bess musket recovered by [[St. Augustine Light#Lighthouse Archaeological Maritime Program (LAMP)|LAMP]] archaeologists from an American Revolutionary War era shipwreck lost in December 1782. It is believed to be a 1769 Short Land Pattern, and is loaded with [[buck and ball]]]]\n\nMany variations and modifications of the standard pattern musket were created over its long history. The earliest version was the Long Land Pattern of 1722, a 62-inch (1,575&nbsp;mm) long (without bayonet) and with a 46-inch (1,168&nbsp;mm) barrel. It was later found that shortening the barrel did not detract from accuracy but made handling easier, giving rise to the Militia (or Marine) Pattern of 1756 and the Short Land Pattern of 1768, which both had a 42-inch (1,067&nbsp;mm) barrel. Another version with a 39-inch (991&nbsp;mm) barrel was first manufactured for the [[British East India Company]], and was eventually adopted by the British Army in 1790 as the India Pattern.\n\nTowards the end of the life of the weapon, there was a change in the system of ignition. The [[flintlock mechanism]], which was prone to misfiring, especially in [[Moisture content|wet weather]], was replaced by the more reliable percussion cap.
