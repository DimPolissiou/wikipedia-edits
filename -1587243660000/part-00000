The [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] is [[veneration|venerated]] in the Eastern Orthodox Church as the [[Theotokos|God-bearer]], honoured in [[Marian devotions|devotions]].\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church shared [[Koinonia|communion]] with the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in the [[state church of Rome]] until the [[East\u2013West Schism]] in 1054, disputing particularly the [[Papal supremacy|authority of the Pope]].

From ancient times through the first millennium, Greek was the most prevalent shared language in the demographic regions where the [[Byzantine Empire]] flourished, and Greek, being the language in which the New Testament was written, was the primary liturgical language of the church. For this reason, the eastern churches were sometimes identified as \"Greek\" (in contrast to the \"Roman\" or \"Latin\" church, which used a Latin translation of the Bible), even before the Great Schism of 1054. After 1054, \"Greek Orthodox\" or \"Greek Catholic\" marked a church as being in communion with Constantinople, much as \"Catholic\" did for communion with Rome. This identification with Greek, however, became increasingly confusing with time. Missionaries brought Orthodoxy to many regions without ethnic Greeks, where the Greek language was not spoken. In addition, struggles between Rome and Constantinople to control parts of [[Southeast Europe|Southeastern Europe]] resulted in the conversion of some churches to Rome, which then also used \"Greek Catholic\" to indicate their continued use of the Byzantine rites. Today, many of those same churches remain, while a very large number of Orthodox are not of Greek national origin, and do not use Greek as the language of worship.{{sfn|Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online || loc=[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/177174/Eastern-Orthodoxy \"Eastern Orthodoxy\"] \"Because of the use of the name \"Greek Catholics\" by the Eastern churches of the Catholic Church and the historical links of the Orthodox Catholic church with the Eastern Roman Empire and Byzantium (Constantinople), however, the [[exonym]]s in American English usage referred to it as the \"Eastern\" or \"Greek Orthodox\" Church. These terms are sometimes misleading, especially when applied to Russian or Slavic churches and to the Orthodox communities in western Europe and America.\"}} \"Eastern\", then, indicates the geographical element in the Church's origin and development, while \"Orthodox\" indicates the faith, as well as communion with the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople.<ref name=Calivas1983 /> There are additional Christian churches in the east that are in communion with neither Rome nor Constantinople, who tend to be distinguished by the category named \"Oriental Orthodox\". While the church continues officially to call itself \"Catholic\", for reasons of universality, the common title of \"Eastern Orthodox Church\" avoids casual confusion with the Roman Catholic Church.\n\n===Orthodoxy===\n[[File:Byzantinischer Mosaizist um 1000 002.jpg|thumb|[[Emperor Constantine]] presents a representation of the city of [[Constantinople]] as tribute to an enthroned Mary and baby Jesus in this church mosaic ([[Hagia Sophia]], c. 1000)]]\n\nThe first known use of the phrase \"the catholic Church\" (''he katholike ekklesia'') occurred in a letter written about 110 AD from one Greek church to another ([[Saint Ignatius of Antioch]] to the [[Smyrna]]eans). The letter states: \"Wheresoever the bishop shall appear, there let the people be, even as where Jesus may be, there is the universal [katholike] Church.\"<ref name=\"CathEnc1910_Catholic\">{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03449a.htm|encyclopedia=The Catholic Encyclopedia |title=Catholic|last=Thurston |first=Herbert |authorlink=Herbert Thurston|place=New York |publisher=Robert Appleton Company|date=1908 |accessdate=17 August 2012|editor-first=Kevin |editor-last=Knight |editor-link=Knight |volume=3}}</ref> Thus, almost from the very beginning, Christians referred to the Church as the \"One, Holy, [[Catholic (term)|Catholic]] (from the Greek \u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae, or \"according to the whole, universal\") and Apostolic Church\".{{sfn|Hardon|1981|p=[https://books.google.com/?id=3Ke37zpSv3gC&pg=PA217 217]}} The Eastern Orthodox Church claims that it is today the continuation and preservation of that same early Church.\n\nA number of other Christian churches also make a similar claim: the Roman [[Catholic Church]], the [[Anglican Communion]], the [[Assyrian Church of the East|Assyrian Church]] and the [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]]. In the Eastern Orthodox view, the Assyrians and Orientals left the Orthodox Church in the years following the Third Ecumenical [[Council of Ephesus]] (431) and the Fourth Ecumenical [[Council of Chalcedon]] (451), respectively, in their refusal to accept those councils' [[Christology|Christological]] definitions. Similarly, the churches in Rome and Constantinople separated in an event known as the [[East\u2013West Schism]], traditionally dated to the year 1054, although it was more a gradual process than a sudden break. The [[Church of England]] separated from the Catholic Church, not directly from the Eastern Orthodox Church, for the first time in the 1530s (and, after a brief reunion in 1555, again finally in 1558). Thus, though it was united to Orthodoxy when established through the work of [[Saint Augustine of Canterbury]] in the early 7th century, its separation from Orthodoxy came about indirectly through the [[Holy See|See of Rome]].\n\nTo all these churches, the claim to [[catholicity]] (universality, oneness with the ancient Church) is important for multiple doctrinal reasons that have more bearing internally in each church than in their relation to the others, now separated in faith. The meaning of holding to a faith that is true is the primary reason why anyone's statement of which church split off from which other has any significance at all; the issues go as deep as the schisms. The depth of this meaning in the Eastern Orthodox Church is registered first in its use of the word \"[[Orthodoxy|Orthodox]]\" itself, a union of [[Greek language|Greek]] ''orthos'' (\"straight\", \"correct\", \"true\", \"right\") and ''[[doxa]]'' (\"common belief\", from the ancient verb \u03b4\u03bf\u03ba\u03ad\u03c9-\u03b4\u03bf\u03ba\u1ff6 which is translated \"to believe\", \"to think\", \"to consider\", \"to imagine\", \"to assume\").<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Ddoke%2Fw \u03b4\u03bf\u03ba\u03ad\u03c9] in Liddell and Scott</ref>\n\nThe dual meanings of ''doxa'', with \"glory\" or \"glorification\" (of God by the Church and of the Church by God), especially in worship, yield the pair \"correct belief\" and \"true worship\". Together, these express the core of a fundamental teaching about the inseparability of belief and worship and their role in drawing the church together with Christ.{{sfn|Ware|1991|pp=16, 271}}{{sfn|Hierotheos|1998|pp=69\u201372}} The [[Bulgaria]]n and all the [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] churches use the title ''Pravoslavie'' ([[Cyrillic alphabets|Cyrillic]]: \u041f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0435), meaning \"correctness of glorification\", to denote what is in English ''Orthodoxy'', while the Georgians use the title ''Martlmadidebeli''. Several other churches in [[Europe]], [[Asia]], and [[Africa]] also came to use ''Orthodox'' in their titles, but are still distinct from the Eastern Orthodox Church as described in this article.\n\nThe term \"Eastern Church\" (the geographic east in the East\u2013West Schism) has been used to distinguish it from [[Western Christianity|western Christendom]] (the geographic West, which at first came to designate the Catholic communion, later also the various Protestant and Anglican branches). \"Eastern\" is used to indicate that the highest concentrations of the Eastern Orthodox Church presence remain in the eastern part of the Christian world, although it is growing worldwide. Orthodox Christians throughout the world use various ethnic or national jurisdictional titles, or more inclusively, the title \"Eastern Orthodox\", \"Orthodox Catholic\", or simply \"Orthodox\".<ref name=\"Calivas1983\">{{cite web|url=http://www.goarch.org/ourfaith/ourfaith7052/|title=The Orthodox Church: An Introduction|date=9 January 1996|website=[[Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America]]|last1=Fitzgerald|first1=Thomas|accessdate=11 June 2016|url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603103953/http://www.goarch.org/ourfaith/ourfaith7052|archivedate=3 June 2016|df=}}</ref>\n\nWhat unites Orthodox Christians is the catholic faith as carried through holy tradition. That faith is expressed most fundamentally in scripture and worship,{{sfn|Ware|1991|pp=212\u2013213}} and the latter most essentially through baptism and in the [[Divine Liturgy]].{{sfn|Ware|1991|p=282}} Orthodox Christians proclaim the faith lives and breathes by God's energies in communion with the church. Inter-communion is the litmus test by which all can see that two churches share the same faith; lack of inter-communion (excommunication, literally \"out of communion\") is the sign of different faiths, even though some central theological points may be shared. The sharing of beliefs can be highly significant, but it is not the full measure of the faith according to the Orthodox.\n\nThe lines of even this test can blur, however, when differences that arise are not due to doctrine, but to recognition of jurisdiction. As the Eastern Orthodox Church has spread into the west and over the world, the church as a whole has yet to sort out all the inter-jurisdictional issues that have arisen in the expansion, leaving some areas of doubt about what is proper church governance.{{sfn|Ware|1991|pp=180\u2013199}} And as in the ancient church persecutions, the aftermath of [[Persecution of Christians in the Soviet Union|persecutions of Christians in communist nations]] has left behind both some governance and some faith issues that have yet to be completely resolved.{{sfn|Ware|1991|pp=152\u2013179}}\n\nAll members of the Eastern Orthodox Church profess the same faith, regardless of race or nationality, jurisdiction or local custom, or century of birth. Holy tradition encompasses the understandings and means by which that unity of faith is transmitted across boundaries of time, geography, and culture.

The doctrine of the [[Catholicity|Catholicity of the Church]], as derived from the [[Nicene Creed]], is essential to Eastern Orthodox [[ecclesiology]]. The term ''Catholicity of the Church'' ([[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u039a\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u1f18\u03ba\u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03af\u03b1\u03c2}}) is used in its original sense, as a designation for the [[Universality of the Church]], centered around Christ. Therefore, the Eastern Orthodox notion of [[catholicity]] is not centered around any singular see, unlike Catholicism, that has one earthly center.\n\nDue to the influence of the Catholic Church in the west, where the [[English language]] itself developed, the words \"catholic\" and \"catholicity\" are sometimes used to refer to that church specifically. However, the more prominent dictionary sense given for general use is still the one shared by other languages, implying breadth and universality, reflecting comprehensive scope.{{sfn|American Heritage Dict|5th ed|p=294 [http://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=catholicity \"catholicity\"]}} In a Christian context, the Christian Church, as identified with the original Church founded by Christ and his apostles, is said to be catholic (or universal) in regard to its union with Christ in faith. Just as Christ is indivisible, so are union with him and faith in him, whereby the Church is \"universal\", unseparated, and comprehensive, including all who share that faith. Orthodox bishop [[Kallistos Ware]] has called that \"simple Christianity\".{{sfn|Ware|1991|p=16}} That is the sense of early and [[patristic]] usage wherein the church usually refers to itself as the \"Catholic Church\",{{sfn|Encyclopedia of Christianity|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/?id=7ly4DgtT3LkC&pg=PA867 867]}}{{sfn|Leith|1982|p=[https://books.google.com/?id=saFgJRjaPwcC&pg=PA486 486]}} whose faith is the \"Orthodox faith\". It is also the sense within the phrase \"One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church\", found in the [[Nicene Creed]], and referred to in Orthodox worship, e.g. in the litany of the catechumens in the Divine Liturgy.\n\nWith the mutual excommunications of the East\u2013West Schism in 1054, the churches in Rome and Constantinople each viewed the other as having departed from the [[One true church|true Church]], leaving a smaller but still-catholic church in place. Each retained the \"Catholic\" part of its title, the \"''Roman'' Catholic Church\" (or [[Catholic Church]]) on the one hand, and the \"''Orthodox'' Catholic Church\" on the other, each of which was defined in terms of inter-communion with either Rome or Constantinople. While the Eastern Orthodox Church recognises what it shares in common with other churches, including the Catholic Church, it sees catholicity in terms of complete union in communion and faith, with the Church throughout all time, and the sharing remains incomplete when not shared fully.\n\n==Organisation and leadership==\n{{Main|Orthodox Church organization}}The religious authority for Eastern Orthodoxy is not a patriarch or the Bishop of Rome as in Catholicism, nor the Bible as in [[Protestantism]], but the scriptures as interpreted by the seven ecumenical councils of the [[State church of the Roman Empire|Imperial Roman Church]]. The Eastern Orthodox Church is a fellowship of \"[[Autocephaly|autocephalous]]\" (Greek for self-headed) churches, with the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]] being the only autocephalous head who holds the title ''[[primus inter pares]]'', meaning \"first among equals\" in Latin. The Patriarch of Constantinople has the honor of primacy, but his title is only first among equals and has no real authority over churches other than the Constantinopolitan,<ref name=brit /><ref name=\"bbc\">{{cite web|title=Eastern Orthodox Church|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/subdivisions/easternorthodox_1.shtml|publisher=BBC|accessdate=26 July 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"religionfacts\">{{cite web|title=Eastern Ortthodoxy|url=http://www.religionfacts.com/orthodox-christianity|website=www.religionfacts.com|accessdate=26 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150627011432/http://www.religionfacts.com/orthodox-christianity|archive-date=27 June 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> though at times the office of the Ecumenical Patriarch has been accused of Constantinopolitan or Eastern papism.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://orthochristian.com/117117.html|title=Archpriest Vadim Leonov.

The Apotheosis of Eastern Papism|website=OrthoChristian.Com|access-date=2019-01-09}}</ref> The Eastern Orthodox Church considers [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] to be the head of the church and the church to be his body. It is believed that authority and the [[Divine grace|grace of God]] is directly passed down to Orthodox [[bishop]]s and [[clergy]] through the [[laying on of hands]]\u2014a practice started by the [[Apostle (Christian)|apostles]], and that this unbroken historical and physical link is an essential element of the true Church (Acts 8:17, 1 Tim 4:14, Heb 6:2). The Orthodox Church asserts that apostolic succession requires apostolic faith, and bishops without apostolic faith, who are in [[heresy]], forfeit their claim to apostolic succession.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Morris |first1=Fr.

These include the fourteen autocephalous churches of [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Constantinople]], [[Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Alexandria]], [[Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Antioch and All the East|Antioch]], [[Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem|Jerusalem]], [[Georgian Orthodox Church|Georgia]], [[Church of Cyprus|Cyprus]], [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church|Bulgaria]], [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbia]], [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russia]], [[Church of Greece|Greece]], [[Polish Orthodox Church|Poland]], [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romania]], [[Albanian Orthodox Church|Albania]], and the [[Czech and Slovak Orthodox Church|Czech Republic and Slovakia]], which were officially invited to the [[Pan-Orthodox Council]] of 2016,<ref name=\"council2016\">{{cite web|url=https://www.holycouncil.org/churches|title=The Orthodox Churches \u2013 The Holy and Great Council of the Orthodox Church|website=www.holycouncil.org}}</ref> the [[Orthodox Church in America]] formed in 1970, the autocephalous [[Orthodox Church of Ukraine]] created in 2019, as well as a number of autonomous churches.<ref name=bbc /> Each church has a ruling [[bishop]] and a [[Holy Synod|holy synod]] to administer its jurisdiction and to lead the Orthodox Church in the preservation and teaching of the apostolic and [[wikt:patristic|patristic]] traditions and church practices.\n\nEach bishop has a territory ([[episcopal see|see]]) over which he governs.<ref name=religionfacts /> His main duty is to make sure the traditions and practices of the Orthodox Church are preserved. Bishops are equal in authority and cannot interfere in the jurisdiction of another bishop. Administratively, these bishops and their territories are organised into various [[autocephaly|autocephalous]] groups or [[synod]]s of [[bishop]]s who gather together at least twice a year to discuss the state of affairs within their respective sees. While bishops and their autocephalous synods have the ability to administer guidance in individual cases, their actions do not usually set precedents that affect the entire Eastern Orthodox Church. Bishops are almost always chosen from the monastic ranks and must remain unmarried.\n\n=== Church councils ===\n{{More citations needed section|date=July 2019}}\nThere have been a number of times when alternative theological ideas arose to challenge the Orthodox faith. At such times the Orthodox communion deemed it necessary to convene a general or [[Ecumenical council|\"great\" council]] of all available bishops throughout the world. The Orthodox Church holds that [[first seven Ecumenical Councils|seven ecumenical councils]], held between the 4th and the 8th centuries, are authoritative.\n\n[[File:Rylands Nicene Creed papyrus.jpg|thumb|Oldest extant manuscript of the [[Nicene Creed]], dated to the 5th Century|256x256px]]\n\nThe ecumenical councils followed a democratic form, with each bishop having one vote. Though present and allowed to speak before the council, members of the [[Roman Empire|Imperial Roman]]/[[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] court, abbots, priests, deacons, monks and laymen were not allowed to vote. The primary goal of these great synods was to verify and confirm the fundamental beliefs of the [[Great Church|Great Christian Church]] as truth, and to remove as heresy any false teachings that would threaten the Church. The [[Pope|Pope of Rome]] at that time held the position of \"[[Primus inter pares]]\" (\"first among equals\") and, while he was not present at any of the councils, he continued to hold this title until the [[East\u2013West Schism]] of 1054.\n\nOther councils have helped to define the Eastern Orthodox position, specifically the [[Quinisext Council]], the Synods of [[Constantinople]], [[Fourth Council of Constantinople (Eastern Orthodox)|879\u2013880]], [[Fifth Council of Constantinople|1341, 1347, 1351]], 1583, 1819, and [[Phyletism|1872]], the [[Synod of Jassy]] (Ia\u0219i), 1642, and the Pan-Orthodox [[Synod of Jerusalem (1672)|Synod of Jerusalem]], 1672; the [[Pan-Orthodox Council]], held in Greece in 2016, was the only such Eastern Orthodox council in modern times.\n\nAccording to Orthodox teaching the position of \"first among equals\" gives no additional power or authority to the bishop that holds it, but rather that this person sits as organizational head of a council of equals (like a president). His words and opinions carry no more insight or wisdom than any other bishop. It is believed that the Holy Spirit guides the Eastern Orthodox Church through the decisions of the entire council, not one individual. Additionally it is understood that even the council's decisions must be accepted by the entire Orthodox Church in order for them to be valid.\n\nOne of the decisions made by the [[First Council of Constantinople]] (the second ecumenical council, meeting in 381) and supported by later such councils was that the Patriarch of Constantinople should be given equal honor to the Pope of Rome since Constantinople was considered to be the \"[[New Rome]]\". According to the third canon of the second ecumenical council: \"Because it is new Rome, the bishop of Constantinople is to enjoy the privileges of honor ''after'' the bishop of Rome.\" This means that both enjoy the same privileges because they are both bishops of the imperial capitals, but the bishop of Rome will precede the bishop of Constantinople since Old Rome precedes New Rome.\n\nThe 28th canon of the fourth ecumenical council clarified this point by stating: \"For the Fathers rightly granted privileges to the throne of Old Rome because it was the royal city. And the One Hundred and Fifty most religious Bishops (i.e. the second ecumenical council in 381) actuated by the same consideration, gave equal privileges to the most holy throne of New Rome, justly judging that the city which is honoured with the Sovereignty and the Senate, and enjoys equal privileges with the old imperial Rome, should in ecclesiastical matters also be magnified as she is.\"\n\nBecause of the schism the Eastern Orthodox no longer recognise the primacy of the Pope of Rome. The Patriarch of Constantinople therefore, like the Pope before him, now enjoys the title of \"first among equals\".\n\n===Adherents===\n{{Further|Eastern Orthodoxy by country}}\n[[File:Eastern Orthodoxy by country.png|thumb|'''Distribution <!-- among who? -->of Eastern Orthodox Christians in the world by country:'''\n{{legend|#000055|More than 75%}}\n{{legend|#0000aa|50\u201375%}}\n{{legend|#0000ff|20\u201350%}}\n{{legend|#5555ff|5\u201320%}}\n{{legend|#aaaaff|1\u20135%}}\n{{legend|#b4c8ff|Below 1%, but has local [[autocephaly]]}}\n|211x211px]]\n<!---This article and hence this section is about Eastern Orthodoxy.

(philosophy)|hypostases]]''), without overlap or [[Sabellianism|modality]] among them, who each have one divine [[essence]] (''ousia'' Greek \u03bf\u1f50\u03c3\u03af\u03b1)\u2014uncreated, immaterial and [[eternity|eternal]].{{sfn|Ware|1993|pp=208\u2013211}} These three persons are typically distinguished by their relation to each other. The [[God the Father|Father]] is eternal and not begotten and does not proceed from any, the [[God the Son|Son]] is eternal and begotten of the Father, and the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]] is eternal and proceeds from the Father. Orthodox doctrine regarding the Trinity is summarised in the [[Nicene Creed#Niceno\u2013Constantinopolitan Creed|Nicene Creed]].{{sfn|Ware|1993|p=202}}\n\nIn discussing God's relationship to his creation, Orthodox theology [[Essence\u2013Energies distinction|distinguishes]] between God's eternal essence, which is totally transcendent, and his ''uncreated energies'', which is how he reaches humanity. The God who is transcendent and the God who touches mankind are one and the same. That is, these energies are not something that proceed from God or that God produces, but rather they are God himself: distinct, yet inseparable from God's inner being.{{sfn|Ware|1993|pp=67\u201369}}\n\nIn understanding the Trinity as \"one God in three persons\", \"three persons\" is not to be emphasised more than \"one God\", and vice versa. While the three persons are distinct, they are united in one divine essence, and their oneness is expressed in community and action so completely that they cannot be considered separately. For example, their salvation of mankind is an activity engaged in common: \"Christ became man by the good will of the Father and by the cooperation of the Holy Spirit. Christ sends the Holy Spirit who proceeds from the Father, and the Holy Spirit forms Christ in our hearts, and thus God the Father is glorified.\" Their \"communion of essence\" is \"indivisible\". Trinitarian terminology\u2014essence, hypostasis, etc.\u2014are used \"philosophically\", \"to answer the ideas of the heretics\", and \"to place the terms where they separate error and truth.\"{{sfn|Hierotheos|1998|pp=128\u2013130}} The words do what they can do, but the nature of the Trinity in its fullness is believed to remain beyond man's comprehension and expression, a holy mystery that can only be experienced.\n\n===Sin, salvation, and the incarnation===\n[[File:Ioann Damaskin ikona.jpg|alt=|thumb|[[John of Damascus]]]]\nAccording to the Eastern Orthodox faith, at some point in the beginnings of human existence, humanity was faced with a choice: to learn the difference between good and evil through observation or through participation. The biblical story of [[Adam and Eve]] relates this choice by mankind to participate in evil, accomplished through disobedience to God's command. Both the intent and the action were separate from God's will; it is that separation that defines and marks any operation as sin. The separation from God caused the loss of (fall from) his grace, a severing of mankind from his creator and the source of his life. The end result was the diminishment of human nature and its subjection to death and corruption, an event commonly referred to as the \"fall of man\".\n\nWhen Orthodox Christians refer to fallen nature they are not saying that human nature has become evil in itself. Human nature is still formed in the image of God; humans are still God's creation, and God has never created anything evil, but fallen nature remains open to evil intents and actions. It is sometimes said among Orthodox that humans are \"inclined to sin\"; that is, people find some sinful things attractive. It is the nature of temptation to make sinful things seem the more attractive, and it is the fallen nature of humans that seeks or succumbs to the attraction. Orthodox Christians reject the Augustinian position that the descendants of Adam and Eve are actually guilty of the original sin of their ancestors.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Matusiak |first1=Fr. John |title=Original Sin |publisher=Orthodox Church in America |url=http://www.oca.org/QA.asp?ID=3&SID=3 |accessdate=23 May 2014 |ref=none }}</ref> But just as any species begets its own kind, so fallen humans beget fallen humans, and from the beginning of humanity's existence people lie open to sinning by their own choice.\n\nSince the fall of man, then, it has been mankind's dilemma that no human can restore his nature to union with God's grace; it was necessary for God to effect another change in human nature. Orthodox Christians believe that Christ Jesus was both God and Man absolutely and completely, having two natures indivisibly: eternally begotten of the Father in his divinity, he was born in his humanity of a woman, Mary, by her consent, through descent of the Holy Spirit. He lived on earth, in time and history, as a man. As a man he also died, and went to the place of the dead, which is [[Christian views on Hades|Hades]]. But being God, neither death nor Hades could contain him, and he rose to life again, in his humanity, by the power of the Holy Spirit, thus destroying the power of Hades and of death itself.{{sfn|Chrysostom|400|loc=[[Paschal Homily]]}} Through God's participation in humanity, Christ's human nature, perfected and unified with his divine nature, ascended into heaven, there to reign in communion with the Father and Holy Spirit.\n\nBy these acts of salvation, Christ provided fallen mankind with the path to escape its fallen nature. The Eastern Orthodox Church teaches that through baptism into Christ's death, and a person's death unto sin in repentance, with God's help mankind can also rise with Christ into heaven, healed of the breach of man's fallen nature and restored to God's grace. To Orthodox Christians, this process is what is meant by \"salvation,\" which consists of the Christian life. The ultimate goal is [[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]] an even closer union with God and closer likeness to God than existed in the [[Garden of Eden]]. This process is called [[Divinization (Christian)|Deification]] or \"God became man that man might become 'god'\". However, it must be emphasised that Orthodox Christians do not believe that man becomes God in his essence, or a god in his own nature. More accurately, Christ's salvific work enables man in his human nature to become \"partakers of the Divine nature\" (2 Peter 1:4); that is to say, man is united to God in Christ.\n\nThrough Christ's destruction of Hades' power to hold humanity hostage, he made the path to salvation effective for all the righteous who had died from the beginning of time\u2014saving many, including Adam and Eve, who are remembered in the Church as saints.{{sfn|St. Athanasius|1982|loc=Ch. 2\u20133, p. 318}}\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox reject the idea that Christ died to give God \"satisfaction\" as taught by [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]], or as a punitive substitute as taught by the Reformers. Sin (separation from God, who is the source of all life) is its own punishment, capable of imprisoning the soul in an existence without life, without anything good, and without hope: hell by any measure. Life on earth is God's gift, to give humankind opportunity to make their choice real: separation or union.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n===Resurrection of Christ===\n[[File:1678. \u0421\u0430\u0448\u044d\u0441\u0446\u0435 \u045e \u043f\u0435\u043a\u043b\u0430.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|A 17th-century [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] icon of the Resurrection]]\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church understands the death and resurrection of Jesus to be real historical events, as described in the gospels of the [[New Testament]]. Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is believed to, according to Orthodox teaching, in his humanity be (that is, in history) crucified, and died, descending into Hades ([[Sheol]]), the place of the dead, as all humans do. But he, alone among humans, has two natures, one human, one divine, which are indivisible and inseparable from each other through the mystery of the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnation]]. Hades could not restrain the infinite God. Christ in his divine nature [[Harrowing of Hell|captured the keys of Hades]] and broke the bonds which had imprisoned the human souls who had been held there through their separation from God.\n\nNeither could death contain the Son of God, the Fountain of Life, who arose from death even in his human nature. Not only this, but he opened the gates of Hades to all the righteous dead of past ages, rescuing them from their fallen human nature and restoring them to a nature of grace with God, bringing them back to life, this time in God's heavenly kingdom. And this path he opened to all who choose to follow him in time yet to come, thus saving the human race. Thus the Eastern Orthodox proclaim each year at the time of Pascha ([[Easter]]), that Christ \"trampled down death by death, and on those in the tombs bestowed life.\"\n\nThe celebration of the [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]] of Christ at Pascha is the central event in the [[Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar|liturgical year]] of the Eastern Orthodox Church. According to Orthodox tradition, each human being may partake of this immortality, which would have been impossible without the Resurrection; it is the main promise held out by God in the [[New Testament]]. Every holy day of the Eastern Orthodox [[liturgical]] year relates to the Resurrection directly or indirectly. Every Sunday is especially dedicated to celebrating the Resurrection and the triune God, representing a mini-Pascha. In the liturgical commemorations of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion of Christ]] during [[Holy Week]] there are frequent allusions to the ultimate victory at its completion.\n\n===Christian life===\nChurch teaching is that Orthodox Christians, through baptism, enter a new life of salvation through repentance whose purpose is to share in the life of God through the work of the Holy Spirit. The Eastern Orthodox Christian life is a spiritual pilgrimage in which each person, through the [[imitation of Christ]] and ''[[hesychasm]]'',{{sfn|Hierotheos|1998|pp=234\u2013237,(241=Glossary)}} cultivates the practice of unceasing prayer. Each life occurs within the life of the church as a member of the [[body of Christ]].{{sfn|George|2006|p=[http://orthodoxinfo.com/general/theosis-english.pdf 34]}} It is then through the fire of God's love in the action of the Holy Spirit that each member becomes more holy, more wholly unified with Christ, starting in this life and continuing in the next.{{sfn|Oxford Dict Christian Church|3rd ed}}<ref>{{cite web |last1=Fitzgerald |first1=Fr.

God the creator, having divinity by nature, offers each person participation in divinity by cooperatively accepting His gift of grace.{{sfn|George|2006|p=[http://orthodoxinfo.com/general/theosis-english.pdf 21]}}\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church, in understanding itself to be the Body of Christ, and similarly in understanding the Christian life to lead to the unification in Christ of all members of his body, views the church as embracing all Christ's members, those now living on earth, and also all those through the ages who have passed on to the heavenly life. The church includes the Christian saints from all times, and also judges, prophets and righteous Jews of the first covenant, Adam and Eve, even the angels and heavenly hosts.{{sfn|Hierotheos|1998|pp=25\u201330}} In Orthodox services, the earthly members together with the heavenly members worship God as one community in Christ, in a union that transcends time and space and joins heaven to earth. This unity of the Church is sometimes called the ''communion of the saints''.{{sfn|Hierotheos|1998|p=23}}\n\n===Virgin Mary and other saints===\n[[File:Tinos panagia evangelistria 200707 04.jpg|thumb|[[Our Lady of Tinos]] is the major [[Marian shrine]] in [[Greece]]]]\n[[File:Vladimirskaya.jpg|thumb|The [[Theotokos of Vladimir]], one of the most venerated of Orthodox Christian icons of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]]|298x298px]]\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church believes death and the separation of body and soul to be unnatural\u2014a result of the [[Fall of Man]]. They also hold that the congregation of the church comprises both the living and the dead. All persons currently in heaven are considered to be [[saint]]s, whether their names are known or not. There are, however, those saints of distinction whom God has revealed as particularly good examples. When a saint is revealed and ultimately recognised by a large portion of the church a service of official recognition ([[canonization]]) is celebrated.\n\nThis does not \"make\" the person a saint; it merely recognises the fact and announces it to the rest of the church. A day is prescribed for the saint's celebration, hymns composed and icons created. Numerous saints are celebrated on each day of the year. They are venerated (shown great respect and love) but not worshipped, for worship is due God alone (this view is also held by the [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]] and [[Catholic Church]]es). In showing the saints this love and requesting their prayers, the Eastern Orthodox manifest their belief that the saints thus assist in the process of salvation for others.\n\nPre-eminent among the saints is the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]] (commonly referred to as ''Theotokos'' or ''Bogoroditsa'') (\"[[Mother of God]]\"). In Orthodox theology, the Mother of God is the fulfillment of the Old Testament archetypes revealed in the [[Ark of the Covenant]] (because she carried the New Covenant in the person of Christ) and the [[burning bush]] that appeared before [[Moses]] (symbolizing the Mother of God's carrying of God without being consumed).<ref>{{cite book|last=Meyendorff|first=Gregory of Nyssa; transl., introduction and notes by Abraham J. Malherbe and Everett Ferguson; preface by John|title=The life of Moses|year=1978|publisher=Paulist Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8091-2112-0|page=[https://archive.org/details/gregoryofnyssa00abra/page/59 59]|url=https://archive.org/details/gregoryofnyssa00abra/page/59|accessdate=4 October 2013}}</ref> Accordingly, the Eastern Orthodox consider Mary to be the Ark of the New Covenant and give her the respect and reverence as such. The Theotokos, in Orthodox teaching, was chosen by God and she freely co-operated in that choice to be the Mother of Jesus Christ, the God-man.\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox believe that Christ, from the moment of his conception, was both fully God and fully human. Mary is thus called the ''Theotokos'' or ''Bogoroditsa'' as an affirmation of the divinity of the one to whom she gave birth. It is also believed that her virginity was not compromised in conceiving God-incarnate, that she was not harmed and that she remained forever a virgin. Scriptural references to \"brothers\" of Christ are interpreted as kin, given that the word \"brother\" was used in multiple ways, as was the term \"father\". Due to her unique place in salvation history, Mary is honoured above all other saints and especially venerated for the great work that God accomplished through her.{{sfn|Ware|1993|pp=257\u2013258}}\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church regards the bodies of all saints as holy, made such by participation in the holy mysteries, especially the communion of Christ's holy body and blood, and by the indwelling of the Holy Spirit within the church. Indeed, that persons and physical things can be made holy is a cornerstone of the doctrine of the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]], made manifest also directly by God in Old Testament times through his dwelling in the Ark of the Covenant. Thus, physical items connected with saints are also regarded as holy, through their participation in the earthly works of those saints. According to church teaching and tradition, God himself bears witness to this holiness of saints' [[relic]]s through the many miracles connected with them that have been reported throughout history since Biblical times, often including healing from disease and injury.{{sfn|Ware|1993|p=234}}\n\n===Eschatology===\n{{main|Christian eschatology}}\n[[File:Torcello - Santa Maria Assunta.Last Judgement.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|''Last Judgment'': 12th-century [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] mosaic from [[Torcello]] Cathedral]]\n\nOrthodox Christians believe that when a person dies the soul is temporarily separated from the body.

Iconographic depictions of the [[Last Judgment|Final Judgment]] are often portrayed on the back (western) wall of the church building to remind the departing faithful to be vigilant in their struggle against sin. Likewise it is often painted on the walls of the Trapeza (refectory) in a monastery where monks may be inspired to sobriety and detachment from worldly things while they eat.\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox believe that [[Hell in Christianity|Hell]], though often described in metaphor as punishment inflicted by God, is in reality the soul's rejection of God's infinite love which is offered freely and abundantly to everyone.\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox believe that after the Final Judgment:\n* All souls will be reunited with their [[Resurrection of the Dead|resurrected bodies]].\n* All souls will fully experience their spiritual state.\n* Having been perfected, the saints will forever progress towards a deeper and fuller love of God, which equates with eternal happiness.<ref name=soulafterdeath />\n\n===Bible===\nThe official Bible of the Eastern Orthodox Church contains the [[Septuagint]] text of the [[Old Testament]], with the [[Book of Daniel]] given in the translation by [[Theodotion]].

The differences were small and were not considered to compromise the unity of the faith shared between east and west. They did not play a role in the eventual [[East-West Schism|schism in the 11th century]] that separated the See of Rome and the West from the See of Constantinople and the other apostolic Orthodox churches, and remained as defined essentially without controversy in the East or West for at least one thousand years.

God's Word is not hollow, like human words. \"God said, 'let there be light'; and there was light.\"<ref>Holy Bible: {{Bibleverse|Genesis|1:3|NKJV}}</ref> This is the Word which spoke the universe into being, and resonates in creation without diminution throughout all history, a Word of divine power.\n\nAs much as the Eastern Orthodox Church reveres and depends on the scriptures, they cannot compare to the Word of God's manifest action. But the Eastern Orthodox do believe that the Holy Scriptures testify to God's manifest actions in history, and that through its divine inspiration God's Word is manifested both in the scriptures themselves and in the cooperative human participation that composed them. It is in that sense that the Eastern Orthodox refer to the scriptures as \"God's Word\".\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church does not subscribe to the Protestant doctrine of ''[[sola scriptura]]''. The church has defined what Scripture is; it also interprets what its meaning is.<ref>Ware, Bishop Kallistos (Timothy), [http://orthodoxinfo.com/phronema/ware_howto.aspx ''How to Read the Bible''], retrieved 11 June 2013</ref> Christ promised: \"When He, the Spirit of truth, has come, He will guide you into all truth\".<ref>Holy Bible: {{Bibleverse|John|16:13|NKJV}}</ref> The Holy Spirit, then, is the infallible guide for the church to the interpretation of Scripture. The church depends upon those saints who, by lives lived in [[imitation of Christ]], achieving [[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]], can serve as reliable witnesses to the Holy Spirit's guidance. Individual interpretation occurs within the church and is informed by the church. It is rational and reasoned, but is not arrived at only by means of deductive reasoning.\n\nScriptures are understood to contain historical fact, poetry, idiom, metaphor, simile, moral fable, parable, prophecy and [[wisdom literature]], and each bears its own consideration in its interpretation. While divinely inspired, the text stills consists of words in human languages, arranged in humanly recognizable forms. The Eastern Orthodox Church does not oppose honest critical and historical study of the Bible.<ref name=\"Ware1991pp210-5\">{{harvnb|Ware|1991|pp=210\u2013215}}</ref> In biblical interpretation, it does not use speculations, suggestive theories, or incomplete indications, not going beyond what is fully known.\n\n===Holy Tradition and the patristic consensus===\n\"That faith which has been believed everywhere, always, and by all\", the faith taught by Jesus to the apostles, given life by the [[Holy Spirit]] at [[Pentecost]], and passed down to future generations without additions and without subtractions, is known as [[Holy Tradition|holy tradition]].{{sfn|Ware|1993|pp=195\u2013196}}<ref>Letter of 1718, in [[George Williams (priest)|George Williams]], ''The Orthodox Church of the East in the 18th Century'', p. 17</ref> Holy tradition does not change in the Eastern Orthodox Church because it encompasses those things that do not change: the nature of the one God in Trinity, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, the history of God's interactions with his peoples, the Law as given to the Israelites, all Christ's teaching as given to the disciples and Jews and recorded in scripture, including the parables, the prophecies, the miracles, and his own example to humanity in his extreme humility. It encompasses also the worship of the church, which grew out of the worship of the synagogue and temple and was extended by Christ at the last supper, and the relationship between God and his people which that worship expresses, which is also evidenced between Christ and his disciples. It includes the authority that Christ bestowed on his disciples when he made them apostles,<ref>Holy Bible: {{Bibleverse|Matthew|16:19|NKJV}}</ref> for the preserving and teaching of the faith, and for governing the organization and conduct of the church (in its administration by bishops).\n\nHoly tradition is firm, even unyielding, but not rigid or legalistic; instead, it lives and breathes within the church.<ref>[[Vladimir Lossky]], \"''Tradition is the life of the Holy Spirit in the Church.''\"</ref> For example, the New Testament was entirely written by the early church (mostly the apostles). The whole Bible was accepted as scripture by means of holy tradition practiced within the early church. The writing and acceptance took five centuries, by which time the Holy Scriptures themselves had become in their entirety a part of holy tradition.{{sfn|Ware|1991|p=205}} But holy tradition did not change, because \"that faith which has been believed everywhere, always, and by all\" remained consistent, without additions, and without subtractions. The historical development of the Divine Liturgy and other worship services and devotional practices of the church provide a similar example of extension and growth \"without change\".{{sfn|Ware|1991|p=213}}\n\nThe continuity and stability of Orthodox worship throughout the centuries is one means by which holy tradition expresses the unity of the whole church throughout time. Not only can the Eastern Orthodox of today visit a church in a place that speaks a language unknown to the visitors yet have the service remain familiar and understandable to them, but the same would hold true were any able to visit past eras. The church strives to preserve holy tradition \"unchanging\" that it may express the one unchanging faith for all time to come as well.\n\nBesides these, holy tradition includes the doctrinal definitions and statements of faith of the seven ecumenical councils, including the [[Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed]], and some later local councils, patristic writings, canon law, and icons.<ref name=\"Ware1991pp210-5\" /> Not all portions of holy tradition are held to be equally strong. Some, the Holy Scriptures foremost, certain aspects of worship, especially in the Divine Liturgy, the doctrines of the ecumenical councils, the [[Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed]], possess a verified authority that endures forever, irrevocably.<ref name=\"Ware1991pp210-5\" /> However, with local councils and patristic writings, the church applies a selective judgement. Some councils and writers have occasionally fallen into error, and some contradict each other.<ref name=\"Ware1991pp210-5\" />\n\nIn other cases, opinions differ, no consensus is forthcoming, and all are free to choose. With agreement among the Church Fathers, though, the authority of interpretation grows, and full patristic consensus is very strong. With canon law (which tends to be highly rigorous and very strict, especially with clergy) an unalterable validity also does not apply, since canons deal with living on earth, where conditions are always changing and each case is subject to almost infinite variation from the next.<ref name=\"Ware1991pp210-5\" /> Even when and where they were once used with full strictness, their application was not absolute, and was carried out for individuals under the pastoral care of their bishop, who had the authority to decide when individual discipline had been satisfied. This too is a part of the holy tradition.\n\nBy tradition, the Eastern Orthodox Church, when faced with issues that are larger than a single bishop can resolve, holds a local council. The bishops and such others as may attend convene (as St. Paul called the Corinthians to do) to seek the ''mind of the church''.<ref>Holy Bible: {{Bibleverse|1 Cor|1:10|NKJV}}</ref> A council's declarations or edicts then reflect its consensus (if one can be found). An ecumencial council is only called for issues of such import or difficulty or pervasiveness that smaller councils are insufficient to address them. Ecumenical councils' declarations and canons carry binding weight by virtue of their representation across the whole church, by which the mind of the church can be readily seen. However, not all issues are so difficult as to require an ecumenical council to resolve. Some doctrines or decisions, not defined in a formal statement or proclaimed officially, nevertheless are held by the church unshakably and unanimously without internal disturbance, and these, also reflecting the mind of the church, are just as firmly irrevocable as a formal declaration of an ecumenical council. Lack of formality does not imply lack of authority within holy tradition.<ref name=\"Ware1991pp210-5\" /> An example of such unanimity can be found in the acceptance in the 5th century of the lists of books that comprise Holy Scripture, a true canon without official stamp.\n\n===Territorial expansion and doctrinal integrity===\nDuring the course of the early church, there were numerous followers who attached themselves to the Christ and his mission here on Earth, as well as followers who retained the distinct duty of being commissioned with preserving the quality of life and lessons revealed through the experience of Jesus living, dying, resurrecting and ascending among them. As a matter of practical distinction and logistics, people of varying gifts were accorded stations within the community structure\u2014 ranging from the host of agape meals (shared with brotherly and fatherly love), to prophecy and the reading of Scripture, to preaching and interpretations and giving aid to the sick and the poor. Sometime after Pentecost the Church grew to a point where it was no longer possible for the Apostles to minister alone. Overseers (bishops)<ref>Holy Bible: {{Bibleverse|Acts|14:23|NKJV}}</ref> and assistants (deacons and deaconesses)<ref>Holy Bible: {{Bibleverse|Acts|6:1\u20136|NKJV}}</ref> were appointed to further the mission of the Church.\n\nThe church recognised the gathering of these early church communities as being greatest in areas of the known world that were famous for their significance on the world stage\u2014either as hotbeds of intellectual discourse, high volumes of trade, or proximity to the original sacred sites. These locations were targeted by the early apostles, who recognised the need for humanitarian efforts in these large urban centers and sought to bring as many people as possible into the church\u2014such a life was seen as a form of deliverance from the decadent lifestyles promoted throughout the eastern and western Roman empires.\n\nAs the church increased in size through the centuries, the logistic dynamics of operating such large entities shifted: patriarchs, metropolitans, archimandrites, abbots and abbesses, all rose up to cover certain points of administration.<ref>[http://www.ctsfw.edu/etext/walther/deacon.asc Concordia Theological Seminary \u2013 Content Not Found] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403033050/http://www.ctsfw.edu/etext/walther/deacon.asc |date=April 3, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nAs a result of heightened exposure and popularity of the philosophical schools (haereseis) of Greco-Roman society and education, synods and councils were forced to engage such schools that sought to co-opt the language and pretext of the Christian faith in order to gain power and popularity for their own political and cultural expansion. As a result, ecumenical councils were held to attempt to rebuild solidarity by using the strength of distant orthodox witnesses to dampen the intense local effects of particular philosophical schools within a given area.\n\nWhile originally intended to serve as an internal check and balance for the defense of the doctrine developed and spread by the apostles to the various sees against faulty local doctrine, at times the church found its own bishops and emperors falling prey to local conventions. At these crucial moments in the history of the church, it found itself able to rebuild on the basis of the faith as it was kept and maintained by monastic communities, who subsisted without reliance on the community of the state or popular culture and were generally unaffected by the materialism and rhetoric that often dominated and threatened the integrity and stability of the urban churches.\n\nIn this sense, the aim of the councils was not to expand or fuel a popular need for a clearer or relevant picture of the original apostolic teaching. Rather, the theologians spoke to address the issues of external schools of thought who wished to distort the simplicity and neutrality of the apostolic teaching for personal or political gain. The consistency of the Eastern Orthodox faith is entirely dependent on the Holy Tradition of the accepted corpus of belief\u2013the decisions ratified by the fathers of the [[First seven Ecumenical Councils|seven ecumenical councils]], and this is only done at the beginning of a consecutive council so that the effects of the decisions of the prior council can be audited and verified as being both conceptually sound and pragmatically feasible and beneficial for the church as a whole.\n\n==Worship==\n{{Main|Byzantine Rite|Eastern Orthodox worship|Western Rite Orthodoxy}}\n[[File:Meister der Sophien-Kathedrale von Ohrid 001.jpg|thumb|[[Fresco]] of [[Basil the Great]], in the church of [[Church of Saint Sophia, Ohrid|Saint Sophia]], [[Ohrid]].

The autonomous [[Orthodox Church of Finland|Church of Finland]] of the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Ecumenical Patriarchate]], as well as parts of the [[Orthodox Church of the Czech Lands and Slovakia|Church of the Czech Lands and Slovakia]], use the [[Gregorian calendar]].{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Many church traditions, including the schedules of services, feasts, and fasts, are structured by the church's calendar, which provides a strictly observed intermingled set of cycles of varying lengths. The fixed annual cycle begins on 1 September and establishes the times for all annual observances that are fixed by date, such as Christmas. The annual Paschal cycle is established relative to the varying date of Pascha each year and affects the times for such observances as [[Easter|Pascha]] itself, [[Great Lent]], [[Holy Week]], and the feasts of [[Feast of the Ascension|Ascension]] and [[Pentecost]].\n\nLesser cycles also run in tandem with the annual ones. A weekly cycle of days prescribes a specific focus for each day in addition to others that may be observed.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Five Cycles |work=Orthodox Worship |publisher=The Diocese of Eastern Pennsylvania, Orthodox Church in America |url=http://doepa.org/about_orthodoxy.html |accessdate=24 June 2015 }}</ref>{{quote|text=Each day of the Weekly Cycle is dedicated to certain special memorials.

Parts of each service remain fixed, while others change depending on the observances prescribed for the specific day in the various cycles, ever providing a flow of constancy within variation. Services are conducted in the church and involve both the clergy and faithful. Services cannot properly be conducted by a single person, but must have at least one other person present (i.e. a priest cannot celebrate alone, but must have at least a chanter present and participating).\n\nUsually, all of the services are conducted on a daily basis only in monasteries and cathedrals, while parish churches might only do the services on the weekend and major feast days. On certain [[Great Feasts]] (and, according to some traditions, every Sunday) a special [[All-Night Vigil]] (''Agrypnia'') will be celebrated from late at night on the eve of the feast until early the next morning. Because of its festal nature it is usually followed by a breakfast feast shared together by the congregation.\n\n{{quote|The journey is to the Kingdom.

[[Basil the Great]] (left) and [[John Chrysostom]], ascribed authors of the two most frequently used [[Eastern Orthodox]] Divine Liturgies, c. 1150 ([[mosaic]] in the [[Cappella Palatina|Palatine Chapel]], [[Palermo]])]]\n\nServices, especially the [[Divine Liturgy]], may only be celebrated once a day on a single altar (some churches have multiple altars in order to accommodate large congregations). Each priest may only celebrate the Divine Liturgy once a day.\n\nFrom its Jewish roots, the liturgical day begins at sundown. The traditional daily cycle of services is as follows:\n* [[Vespers]] \u2013 (Greek ''Hesperinos'') Sundown, the beginning of the liturgical day.\n* [[Compline]] (Greek ''Apodeipnon'', lit. \"After-supper\") \u2013 After the evening meal, and before sleeping.\n* [[Midnight Office]] \u2013 Usually served only in monasteries.\n* [[Matins]] (Greek ''Orthros'') \u2013 First service of the morning. Prescribed to start before sunrise.\n* [[Canonical Hours|Hours]] \u2013 First, Third, Sixth, and Ninth \u2013 Sung either at their appropriate times, or in aggregate at other customary times of convenience. If the latter, The First Hour is sung immediately following Orthros, the Third and Sixth before the Divine Liturgy, and the Ninth before Vespers.\n* [[Divine Liturgy]] \u2013 The [[Eucharist]]ic service. (Called [[Holy Mass]] in the Western Rite)\nThe Divine Liturgy is the celebration of the Eucharist. Although it is usually celebrated between the Sixth and Ninth Hours, it is not considered to be part of the daily cycle of services, as it occurs outside the normal time of the world. The Divine Liturgy is not celebrated on weekdays during [[Great Lent]], and in some places during the lesser fasting seasons either; however, reserve communion is prepared on Sundays and is distributed during the week at the [[Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts]].\n\nOther items brought to the altar during the Divine Liturgy include a gold or silver chalice with red wine, a small metallic urn of warm water, a metallic communion spoon, a little metallic spear, a sponge, a metal disk with cut pieces of bread upon it, and a star, which is a star-shaped piece of metal over which the priest places a cloth covering when transporting the holy gifts to and from the altar. Also found on the altar table is the [[Antimension|antimins]]. The antimins is a silk cloth, signed by the appropriate diocesan bishop, upon which the sanctification of the holy gifts takes place during each Divine Liturgy. The antimins contain the relics of a saint. When a church is consecrated by a bishop, there is a formal service or prayers and sanctification in the name of the saint that the church is named after. The bishop will also often present a small relic of a saint to place in or on the altar as part of the consecration of a new church.\n\nThe book containing liturgically read portions of the four gospels is permanently \"enthroned\" on the altar table. Eastern Orthodox bishops, priests, deacons and readers sing/chant specific verses from this Gospel Book on each different day of the year.\n\nThis daily cycle services is conceived of as both the sanctification of time (''[[chronos]]'', the specific times during which they are celebrated), and entry into eternity (''[[kairos]]''). They consist to a large degree of litanies asking for God's mercy on the living and the dead, readings from the [[Psalms|Psalter]] with introductory prayers, [[troparion|troparia]], and other prayers and hymns surrounding them. The Psalms are so arranged that when all the services are celebrated the entire [[Psalter]] is read through in their course once a week, and twice a week during [[Great Lent]] when the services are celebrated in an extended form.\n\n====Music and chanting====\n[[File:Patriarchate Constantinopolis.jpg|thumb|Chanters singing on the [[kliros]] at the [[Church of St. George, Istanbul|Church of St. George]], [[Patriarchate of Constantinople]]]]\n\nOrthodox services are sung nearly in their entirety. Services consist in part of a dialogue between the clergy and the people (often represented by the choir or the Psaltis [[Cantor (church)|Cantor]]). In each case the prayers are sung or chanted following a prescribed musical form. Almost nothing is read in a normal speaking voice, with the exception of the [[homily]] if one is given.\n\nBecause the human voice is seen as the most perfect instrument of praise, musical instruments ([[organ (music)|organs]], etc.) are not generally used to accompany the choir.\n\nThe church has developed eight modes or tones (see [[Octoechos]]) within which a chant may be set, depending on the time of year, feast day, or other considerations of the [[Typikon]]. There are numerous versions and styles that are traditional and acceptable and these vary a great deal between cultures.{{sfn|Ware|1993|p=238}} It is common, especially in the United States, for a choir to learn many different styles and to mix them, singing one response in Greek, then English, then Russian, etc.\n\nIn the Russian tradition there have been some famous composers of \"unaccompanied\" church music, such as [[Tchaikovsky]] ([[Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom (Tchaikovsky)|Liturgy of St John Chrysostom]], op. 41, 1878, and [[All-Night Vigil (Tchaikovsky)|All-Night Vigil]], op. 52, 1882) and [[Rachmaninoff]] ([[Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom (Rachmaninoff)|Liturgy of St John Chrysostom]], op. 31, 1910, and [[All-Night Vigil (Rachmaninoff)|All-Night Vigil]], op. 37, 1915); and many church tones can likewise be heard influencing their music.\n\n====Incense====\n[[File:\u0415\u0432\u0445\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043a\u0430\u043d\u043e\u043d.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Russian Orthodox [[deacon]] and [[priest]]|alt=]]\nAs part of the legacy handed down from its Judaic roots, [[incense]] is used during all services in the Eastern Orthodox Church as an offering of worship to God as it was done in the Jewish First and Second Temples in Jerusalem (Exodus chapter 30). Incense is also prophesied in the book of {{bibleverse || Malachi|1:11|KJV}} as a \"pure offering\" in the glorification of God by the Gentiles in \"every place\" where the name of God is regarded as \"great\". Traditionally, the base of the incense used is the resin of [[Boswellia sacra]], also known as frankincense, but the resin of fir trees has been used as well. It is usually mixed with various floral essential oils giving it a sweet smell.\n\nIncense represents the sweetness of the prayers of the saints rising up to God ({{bibleverse || Psalm|141:2|KJV}}, {{bibleverse || Revelation|5:8|KJV}}, {{bibleverse-nb || Revelation|8:4|KJV}}). The incense is burned in an ornate golden censer that hangs at the end of three chains representing the Trinity. Two chains represent the human and Godly nature of the Son, one chain for the Father and one chain for the Holy Spirit. The lower cup represents the earth and the upper cup the heaven. In the Greek, Slavic, and Syrian traditions there are 12 bells hung along these chains representing the 12 apostles. There are also 72 links representing 72 evangelists.\n\nThe charcoal represents the sinners. Fire signifies the Holy Spirit and frankincense the good deeds. The incense also represents the grace of the Trinity. The censer is used (swung back and forth) by the priest/deacon to venerate all four sides of the altar, the holy gifts, the clergy, the icons, the congregation, and the church structure itself. Incense is also used in the home where the individual will go around the house and \"cross\" all of the icons saying in Greek: \u1f0d\u03b3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f41 \u0398\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2, \u1f0d\u03b3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f30\u03c3\u03c7\u03c5\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2, \u1f0d\u03b3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f00\u03b8\u03ac\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, \u1f10\u03bb\u03ad\u03b7\u03c3\u03bf\u03bd \u1f21\u03bc\u1fb6\u03c2, or in English: Holy God, Holy Mighty, Holy Immortal, have mercy on us.\n\n===Fasting===\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2018}}\n{{See also|Fasting#Orthodoxy & Eastern Catholicism|l1=Fasting: Orthodoxy & Eastern Catholicism}}\n\n[[File:Cross being thrown at Theophany.jpg|thumb|Blessing of the waters and throwing cross; [[Theophany]]]]\nThe number of fast days varies from year to year, but in general the Eastern Orthodox Christian can expect to spend a little over half the year [[fasting]] at some level of strictness. There are spiritual, symbolic, and even practical reasons for fasting. In the [[Fall of man|Fall from Paradise]] mankind became possessed by a carnal nature; that is to say, became inclined towards the [[Passion (Christianity)|passions]]. Through fasting, Orthodox Christians attempt to return to the relationship of love and obedience to God enjoyed by Adam and Eve in [[Paradise]] in their own lives, by refraining from carnal practices, by bridling the tongue ({{bibleverse || James|3:5\u20136|KJV}}), confession of sins, prayer and almsgiving.\n\nFasting is seen as purification and the regaining of innocence. It is a practice of learning to temper the body's primary desire for food. By learning to temper this basic desire of the body, the practitioner can more readily temper other worldly desires, and thus, become better enabled to draw closer to [[Christian God|God]] in the hope of becoming more [[Deification#In Eastern Christianity|Christ-like]]. Through obedience to the church and its ascetic practices the Eastern Orthodox Christian seeks to rid himself or herself of the ''passions'' (The desires of our fallen carnal nature). All Orthodox Christians are provided with a prescribed set of guidelines. They do not view fasting as a hardship, but rather as a privilege and joy. The teaching of the Church provides both the time and the amount of fasting that is expected as a minimum for every member who chooses to participate. For greater ascesis, some may choose to go without food entirely for a short period of time. A complete three-day fast at the beginning and end of a fasting period is not unusual, and some fast for even longer periods, though this is usually practiced only in monasteries.\n\nIn general, fasting means abstaining from meat and meat products, dairy (eggs and cheese) and dairy products, fish, olive oil, and wine. Wine and oil\u2014and, less frequently, fish\u2014are allowed on certain feast days when they happen to fall on a day of fasting; but animal products and dairy are forbidden on fast days, with the exception of \"Cheese Fare\" week which precedes Great Lent, during which dairy products are allowed. Wine and oil are usually also allowed on Saturdays and Sundays during periods of fast. In some Orthodox traditions, caviar is permitted on [[Lazarus Saturday]], the Saturday before Palm Sunday, although the day is otherwise a fast day. Married couples also abstain from sexual activity on fast days so that they may devote themselves fulsomely to prayer ({{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|7:5|KJV}}).\n\nWhile it may seem that fasting in the manner set forth by the Church is a strict rule, there are circumstances where a person's spiritual guide may allow an [[Economy (Eastern Christianity)|Economy]] because of some physical necessity (e.g. those who are pregnant or infirm, the very young and the elderly, or those who have no control over their diet, such as prisoners or soldiers).\n\nThe time and type of fast is generally uniform for all Orthodox Christians; the times of fasting are part of the [[Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar|ecclesiastical calendar]], and the method of fasting is set by [[canon law]] and holy tradition. There are four major fasting periods during the year: [[Nativity Fast]], [[Great Lent]], [[Apostles' Fast]], and the [[Dormition Fast]]. In addition to these fasting seasons, Orthodox Christians fast on every Wednesday (in commemoration of Christ's betrayal by [[Judas Iscariot]]), and Friday (in commemoration of Christ's [[Crucifixion]]) throughout the year. Monastics often fast on Mondays.\n\nOrthodox Christians who are preparing to receive the Eucharist do not eat or drink at all from vespers (sunset) until after taking [[Holy Communion]]. A similar total fast is expected to be kept on the [[Christmas Eve|Eve of Nativity]], the Eve of [[Epiphany (holiday)|Theophany]] (Epiphany), [[Good Friday|Great Friday]] and [[Holy Saturday]] for those who can do so. There are other individual days observed as fasts (though not as days of total fasting) no matter what day of the week they fall on, such as the [[Beheading of St. John the Baptist]] on 29 August and the [[Feast of the Cross#September 14|Exaltation of the Holy Cross]] on 14 September.\n\n===Almsgiving===\n[[Almsgiving]], more comprehensively described as \"acts of mercy\", refers to any giving of oneself in charity to someone who has a need, such as material resources, work, assistance, counsel, support, or kindness. Along with prayer and fasting, it is considered a pillar of the personal spiritual practices of the Eastern Orthodox Christian tradition. Almsgiving is particularly important during periods of fasting, when the Eastern Orthodox believer is expected to share with those in need the monetary savings from his or her decreased consumption. As with fasting, mentioning to others one's own virtuous deeds tends to reflect a sinful pride, and may also be considered extremely rude.\n\n==Traditions==\n===Monasticism===\n{{Main|Degrees of Orthodox monasticism}}\n[[File:Katharinenkloster Sinai BW 2.jpg|thumb|[[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] (6th century), [[Sinai Peninsula]], [[Egypt]]|220x220px]]\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church places heavy emphasis and awards a high level of prestige to traditions of monasticism and asceticism with roots in [[Early Christianity]] in the [[Near East]] and Byzantine [[Anatolia]]. The most important centres of Christian Orthodox monasticism are [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] in the [[Sinai Peninsula]] ([[Egypt]]) and [[Mount Athos]] in [[Northern Greece]].\n\nAll Orthodox Christians are expected to participate in at least some ascetic works, in response to the [[Law of Christ|commandment of Christ]] to \"come, take up the cross, and follow me.\" ([[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] 10:21 and elsewhere) They are therefore all called to imitate, in one way or another, Christ himself who denied himself to the extent of literally taking up the cross on the way to his voluntary self-sacrifice. However, laypeople are not expected to live in extreme [[asceticism]] since this is close to impossible while undertaking the normal responsibilities of worldly life.\n\nThose who wish to do this therefore separate themselves from the world and live as [[monasticism|monastics]]: monks and nuns. As ascetics ''par excellence'', using the allegorical weapons of prayer and fasting in spiritual warfare against their passions, monastics hold a very special and important place in the Church. This kind of life is often seen as incompatible with any kind of worldly activity including that which is normally regarded as virtuous. Social work, school teaching, and other such work is therefore usually left to laypeople. Ascetics of the Eastern Orthodox Church are recognised by their long hair, and in case of male monks, long beards.\n\n[[File:megaloschema.svg|thumb|Schema worn by monks|alt=|293x293px]]\n\nThere are three main types of monastics. Those who live in monasteries under a common rule are ''coenobitic''. Each monastery may formulate its own rule, and although there are no [[religious order]]s in Orthodoxy some respected monastic centers such as [[Mount Athos]] are highly influential. ''Eremitic'' monks, or [[hermit]]s, are those who live solitary lives. It is the yearning of many who enter the monastic life to eventually become solitary hermits. This most austere life is only granted to the most advanced monastics and only when their superiors feel they are ready for it.\n\nHermits are usually associated with a larger monastery but live in seclusion some distance from the main compound. Their local monastery will see to their physical needs, supplying them with simple foods while disturbing them as little as possible. In between are those in ''semi-eremitic'' communities, or ''sketes'', where one or two monks share each of a group of nearby dwellings under their own rules and only gather together in the central chapel, or ''katholikon'', for liturgical observances.\n\nThe spiritual insight gained from their ascetic struggles make monastics preferred for missionary activity. Bishops are almost always chosen from among monks, and those who are not generally receive the monastic tonsure before their consecrations.\n\nMany (but not all) Orthodox [[seminary|seminaries]] are attached to monasteries, combining academic preparation for [[Holy Orders|ordination]] with participation in the community's life of prayer. Monks who have been ordained to the priesthood are called ''hieromonk'' (priest-monk); monks who have been ordained to the diaconate are called ''hierodeacon'' (deacon-monk). Not all monks live in monasteries, some hieromonks serve as priests in parish churches thus practicing \"monasticism in the world\".\n\nCultural practices differ slightly, but in general ''Father'' is the correct form of address for monks who have been tonsured, while Novices are addressed as ''Brother''. Similarly, ''Mother'' is the correct form of address for nuns who have been tonsured, while Novices are addressed as ''Sister''. Nuns live identical ascetic lives to their male counterparts and are therefore also called ''monachoi'' (monastics) or the feminine plural form in Greek, ''monachai'', and their common living space is called a monastery.\n\n=== Icons and symbols ===\n{{See also|Christian symbolism}}\n[[File:Chrisme Constantinople.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|\"IX\" (Jesus Christ) monogram from a 4th-century [[sarcophagus]] from [[Constantinople]]]]\n[[File:Rom, Calixtus-Katakomben, Steintafel mit Christussymbol \"Chi Rho\".jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|The \"[[Chi-Rho]]\" symbol, [[Catacomb of Callixtus|Catacombs of San Callisto]], [[Rome]]|alt=]]Everything in the Eastern Orthodox Church has a purpose and a meaning revealing God's revelation to man. At the front, or eastern end of the church, is a raised dais with an icon-covered screen or wall ([[iconostasis]] or [[templon]]) separating the nave from the sanctuary. In the center of this wall is the entrance to the altar known as the \"Royal Doors\" through which only the clergy may pass.\n\nThere is a right and left side door on the front of the iconostasis, one depicting the archangel, Michael and the other Gabriel. The priest and altar boys enter and exit through these doors during appropriate parts of the Divine Liturgy. Immediately to the right of the main gate you will always find an icon of Jesus Christ, on the left, an icon of the [[Theotokos]] (Mother of God). Other icons depicted on the iconostasis are Saint John the Forerunner and the Saint after which the church is named.\n\nIn front of the iconostasis is the bishop's chair, a place of honor where a visiting bishop or metropolitan will often sit when visiting the church. An Orthodox priest, when standing at the altar during the Divine Liturgy, faces toward the altar (typically facing east) and properly leads his congregation while together they perform the mystical sacrifice and pray to God.\n\nThe sanctuary contains the Holy Altar, representing the place where Orthodox Christians believe that Christ was born of the virgin Mary, crucified under Pontius Pilate, laid in the tomb, descended into hell, rose from the dead on the third day, ascended into heaven, and will return again at his second coming. A free-standing cross, bearing the body of Christ, may stand behind the altar. On the altar are a cloth covering, a large book containing the gospel readings performed during services, an ark containing presanctified divine gifts (bread and wine) distributed by the deacon or priest to those who cannot come to the church to receive them, and several white beeswax candles.\n\n====Icons====\n{{Main|Icon}}\nThe term 'icon' comes from the Greek word ''eikon'', which simply means image. The Eastern Orthodox believe that the first icons of Christ and [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|the Virgin Mary]] were painted by [[Luke the Evangelist]]. Icons are filled with symbolism designed to convey information about the person or event depicted. For this reason, icons tend to be formulaic, following a prescribed methodology for how a particular person should be depicted, including hair style, body position, clothing, and background details.\n\nIcon painting, in general, is not an opportunity for artistic expression, though each iconographer brings a vision to the piece. It is far more common for an icon to be copied from an older model, though with the recognition of a new saint in the church, a new icon must be created and approved. The personal and creative traditions of [[Catholic Church art|Catholic religious art]] were largely lacking in Orthodox icon painting before the 17th century, when Russian icons began to be strongly influenced by religious paintings and engravings from both Protestant and Catholic Europe. Greek icons also began to take on a strong western influence for a period and the difference between some Orthodox icons and western religious art began to vanish. More recently there has been a trend of returning to the more traditional and symbolic representations.[[File:ConstantinoXI.jpg|thumb|Modern icon depicting [[Constantine XI Palaiologos]], last emperor of the Roman (Byzantine) empire|264x264px]]\n\nAspects of the [[iconography]] borrow from the pre-Christian [[Roman art|Roman]] and [[Hellenistic art]]. [[Henry Chadwick (theologian)|Henry Chadwick]] wrote, \"In this instinct there was a measure of truth. The representations of Christ as the Almighty Lord on his judgment throne owed something to pictures of Zeus. Portraits of the Mother of God were not wholly independent of a pagan past of venerated mother-goddesses. In the popular mind the saints had come to fill a role that had been played by heroes and deities.\"<ref>Henry Chadwick, The Early Church, 283.</ref>\n\nLarge free-standing statues (three-dimensional depictions) are almost non-existent in the Eastern Orthodox Church. This is partly because [[cult image]]s of the Greek gods were a focus of the [[ancient Greek religion]] and its Roman equivalent, and much criticised by Early Christian writers, and partly because icons are meant to show the spiritual nature of man, not the sensual earthly body. [[Relief]]s, however, were used in [[Byzantine art]].\n\nIcons are not considered by the Eastern Orthodox to be idols or objects of worship. The parameters of their usage were clearly spelled out by the [[Second Council of Nicaea|7th ecumenical council]]. Justification for their usage utilises the following logic: before God took human form in Christ, no material depiction was possible and therefore blasphemous even to contemplate. Once God became incarnate, depiction was possible.\n\nAs Christ is believed to be God, it is justified to hold in one's mind the image of God-incarnate. Likewise, when one venerates an icon, it is not the wood or paint that are venerated but rather the individual shown, just as it is not the paper one loves when one might kiss the photograph of a loved one. As [[Saint Basil]] famously proclaimed, honour or veneration of the icon always passes to its archetype. Following this reasoning, the veneration of the glorified human saint made in God's image, is always a veneration of the divine image, and hence God as foundational archetype.\n\nIcons can be found adorning the walls of churches and often cover the inside structure completely.{{sfn|Ware|1993|p=271}} Most Orthodox homes have an area set aside for family prayer, usually an eastern facing wall, where are hung many icons. Icons have been part of Orthodox Christianity since the beginning of the church.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.religionfacts.com/christianity/things/icons.htm |title=Icons \u2013 Orthodox Christianity \u2013 Religion Facts |publisher= |accessdate=5 March 2015 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150322064748/http://www.religionfacts.com/christianity/things/icons.htm |archivedate=March 22, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nIcons are often illuminated by a candle or oil lamp (beeswax for candles and olive oil for lamps are preferred because they are natural and burn cleanly). Besides the practical purpose of making icons visible in an otherwise dark church, both candles and oil lamps symbolise the Light of the World, who is Christ.\n\nTales of miraculous icons are not uncommon, though it has always been considered that the message of such an event was for the immediate faithful involved and therefore does not usually attract crowds. Some miraculous icons whose reputations span long periods of time nevertheless become objects of pilgrimage along with the places where they are kept. As several Orthodox theologians and saints have explored in the past, the icon's miraculous nature is found not in the material, but in the glory of the saint who is depicted. The icon is a window, in the words of [[Pavel Florensky|Paul Florensky]], that actually participates in the glory of what it represents.\n\n====Iconostasis====\n{{Main|Iconostasis}}\n[[File:People's Salvation Cathedral - Days of Consecration 3.jpg|thumb|224x224px|Iconostasis of the [[Romanian People's Salvation Cathedral]]]]\n\nAn ''iconostasis'', also called the ''templon'', is a wall of [[icons]] and religious paintings, separating the [[nave]] from the [[sanctuary]] in a [[church (building)|church]]. ''Iconostasis'' also refers to a portable icon stand that can be placed anywhere within a church. The modern iconostasis evolved from the [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] [[templon]] in the 11th century. The evolution of the iconostasis probably owes a great deal to 14th-century [[Hesychasm|Hesychast]] [[mysticism]] and the wood-carving genius of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].\n\nThe first ceiling-high, five-leveled Russian iconostasis was designed by [[Andrey Rublyov]] in the [[cathedral of the Dormition]] in [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]] in 1408. The separation between sanctuary and nave accomplished by the iconostasis is not mandatory, though it is common practice. Depending on circumstance, the role of the iconostasis can be played by masonry, carved panels, screens, curtains, railings, a cord or rope, plain icons on stands, steps, or nothing at all.\n\n====Cross====\nDepictions of the [[Christian cross|cross]] within the Eastern Orthodox Church are numerous and often highly ornamented, but its use does not extend to all Orthodox traditions.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Some carry special significance.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} The Tri-Bar Cross, popular in Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus, but common throughout the Eastern Orthodox world, seen to the left, has three bars. Its origins are in the early Byzantine Church of the 4th century AD.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\nThe small top crossbar represents the sign that [[Pontius Pilate]] nailed above Christ's head. It often is inscribed with an acronym, \"INRI\", Latin, meaning \"[[INRI|Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews]]\" or \"INBI\", Greek, \"[[INBI|Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews]]\"; however, it is often replaced or amplified by the phrase \"The King of Glory\" in order to answer Pilate's statement with Christ's affirmation, \"My Kingdom is not of this world\".{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\nThere is also a bottom slanting bar which has several explanations. Claims of evidence indicate that there was a small wooden platform for the crucified to stand on in order to support his weight; in Jesus' case his feet were nailed side by side to this platform with one nail each in order to prolong the torture of the cross.\n\nImplied evidence for this comes mainly from two sources, namely, the Bible (in order to cause the victim to die faster, his legs were broken so they could not support his weight and he would suffocate){{citation needed|date=May 2014}} and iconography (all early depictions of the crucifixion show this arrangement, not the later with feet on top with single nail).{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} It has also been pointed out by some experts that the nailed hands of a body crucified in the manner often shown in modern secular art would not support the weight of the body and would tear through. A platform for the feet would relieve this problem.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\nThat the bottom bar is slanted has two explanations, to represent the very real agony which Christ experienced on the cross (a refutation of [[Docetism]]){{citation needed|date=May 2014}} and to signify that the thief on Christ's right chose the right path while the thief on the left did not.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\nOther crosses associated with the Eastern Orthodox Church are the more traditional single-bar crosses, budded designs, the [[Greek cross]], the [[Latin cross]], the [[Jerusalem cross]] (cross patt\u00e9e), [[Celtic cross]]es, and others.<ref>A good explanation of the 3-bar cross was written by Orthodox symbologist Dr Alexander Roman and can be found at http://www.ukrainian-orthodoxy.org/questions/2010/threeBarCross.php</ref> A common symbolism of the slanted foot stool is The foot-rest points up, toward Heaven, on Christ's right hand-side, and downward, to Hades, on Christ's left. \"Between two thieves Thy Cross did prove to be a balance of\nrighteousness: wherefore one of them was dragged down to Hades by the\nweight of his blasphemy ''[the balance points downward],'' whereas the other was lightened of his transgressions unto the comprehension of theology ''[the balance points upward].''

The inscription Jesus Christ in Greek: IC (Iesous) on the left side bar and XC (Xhristos) on the right side bar, with a sun on the top of the cross. There is also typically an inscription on the back in [[Church Slavonic]]: \"\u0441\u043f\u0430\u0441\u0438 \u0438 \u0441\u043e\u0445\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\", \"''Spasi i Sokhrani''\", \"''Save and Protect''\". This cross is known as the Saint Olga Cross.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.gallerybyzantium.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=9_25&products_id=205 | title=St. Olga Cross (10kt Gold) (Large) (High Quality Gauge)}}</ref>\n\n===Art and architecture===\n{{Main|Eastern Orthodox church architecture}}\n[[File:Orthodox-Church-interior.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|An illustration of the traditional interior of an Orthodox church.|alt=]]\nThe church building has many symbolic meanings; perhaps the oldest and most prominent is the concept that the church is the Ark (as in [[Noah's Ark|Noah]]'s) in which the world is saved from the flood of temptations; therefore, most Orthodox churches are rectangular in design. Another popular configuration, especially for churches with large choirs is [[cruciform]] or cross-shaped or what is called the \"Greek-cross.\"\n\nArchitectural patterns vary in shape and complexity, with chapels sometimes added around the main church, or triple altars; but in general, the symbolic layout of the church remains the same. Each church is created with specified qualifications based on what the apostles said in the Bible.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} These qualifications include how big the temple should be.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\n[[File:\u0395\u03c3\u03c9\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u0391\u03b3\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 \u039c\u03b7\u03bd\u03ac 3604 hdr.jpg|thumb|Interior of [[Agios Minas Cathedral]], [[Heraklion]]]]\nThe church building is divided into three main parts: the [[narthex]] ([[Vestibule (Architecture)|vestibule]]), the [[nave]] and the [[sanctuary]] (also called the ''altar'' or ''holy place''). The narthex is where catechumens and non-Orthodox visitors were traditionally asked to stand during services. It is separated from the nave by \"The Royal Gate\". On each side of this gate are candle stands (menalia) representing the pillars of fire that went before the [[Hebrews|Hebrew people]] escaping from Egypt.\n\nThe nave is where most of the congregation stand during services. Traditionally, men stand on the right and women on the left. This is for a number of reasons: (1) Considering the family unit of past centuries the husband was dominant; thus, standing the same distance from the altar, equality is emphasised. (2) The idea of separating the sexes was inherited from the Jewish tradition of doing so within synagogues (3) Separation of sexes also followed the practice of choirs in which different levels of voice are placed in groups to facilitate harmony.\n\nIn general, men and women dress respectfully, typically wearing their \"Sunday best\" to enter the church. Often, women cover their heads as prescribed by Paul (1 Cor. 11:13). Children are considered full members of the church and stand attentively and quietly during services. There is often a choir area at the side or in a loft in back. In addition to the choir, a chanter is always present at the front of the church to chant responses and hymns that are part of the Divine Liturgy offered by the priest. There is usually a dome in the ceiling with an icon of Christ depicted as [[Christ Pantocrator|Ruler of the Universe]] (Pantocrator).\n\nThe [[Archdiocesan Cathedral of the Holy Trinity]] on New York City's [[Upper East Side]] is the largest [[Orthodox Christian]] church in the [[Western Hemisphere]].<ref name=\"google1\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_F5yntZocGIC&pg=PA147&dq=%22holy+trinity%22+cathedral+greek++74#v=onepage&q=%22holy%20trinity%22%20cathedral%20greek%20%2074 |title=The Orthodox Church: Student Edition |author=Thomas E. FitzGerald |publisher= |accessdate=5 January 2013|isbn=978-0-275-96438-2 |year=1998 }}</ref>\n\nApart from the icons, the Eastern Orthodox churches and monasteries are often decorated with [[fresco]]s and [[mosaic]]s.\n\n===Local customs===\n[[File:Broken vases on Holy Saturday in Corfu.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|left|Shards of pottery vases on the street, after being thrown from the windows of nearby houses. A [[Holy Saturday]] tradition in [[Corfu]].]]\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church also has many associated traditions (sometimes referred to simply as customs), compatible with its life and function, but not necessarily tied so closely to the faith itself. These are not generally regarded as a part of Holy Tradition, though no strict dividing line is drawn. As long as compatibility is maintained, general practice often tends to the permissive rather than the restrictive, with the local priest or bishop resolving questions.\n\nMany of these customs are local or cultural, and some are not even especially religious, but form a part of the church's relationship with the people in the time and place where it exists. Where outside customs affect church practices such as worship, a closer watch is kept for guarding the integrity of worship, but suitable local differences are welcomed and celebrated joyfully. The local church customs, especially liturgical ones, are referred to as differences in [[typica]] (Style).\n\nLocality is also expressed in regional terms of churchly jurisdiction, which is often also drawn along national lines. Many Orthodox churches adopt a national title (e.g. [[Orthodox Autocephalous Church of Albania|Albanian Orthodox]], [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church|Bulgarian Orthodox]], [[Antiochian Orthodox Church|Antiochian Orthodox]], [[Georgian Orthodox Church|Georgian Orthodox]], [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]], [[Montenegrin Orthodox Church|Montenegrin Orthodox]], [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodox]], [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]], [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian Orthodox]], [[Ukrainian Orthodox]], etc.) and this title can identify which language is used in services, which bishops preside, and which of the typica is followed by specific [[wikt:congregation|congregations]]. In the Middle East, Orthodox Christians are usually referred to as ''Rum'' (\"Roman\") Orthodox, because of their historical connection with the [[Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire]].{{sfn|Binns|2002|p=3}}\n\nDifferences in ''[[Praxis (Eastern Orthodoxy)|praxis]]'' (\"practice\") tend to be slight, involving things such as the order in which a particular set of hymns are sung or what time a particular service is celebrated. But observances of the saints' days of local saints are more often celebrated in special services within a locality, as are certain national holidays, like Greek Independence Day. In North America, observances of Thanksgiving Day are increasing.\n\nMembers of the church are fully united in faith and the sacred mysteries with all Orthodox congregations, regardless of nationality or location. In general, Orthodox Christians could travel the globe and feel familiar with the services even if they did not know the language being used.\n\nIn the [[Levant]], Christian Orthodox services and identity often combine both the Byzantine Greek and indigenous (Arabic and [[Aramaic]]) traditions. Other Orthodox communities can identify with two Eastern Orthodox churches simultaneously, for example [[Caucasus Greeks]] and [[Pontic Greeks]] in [[Greeks in Russia|Russia]] often identify with both the [[Greek Orthodox Church]] and [[Russian Orthodox Church]], as a result of centuries of assimilation and intermarriage with ethnic Russians and other Christian Orthodox communities in mainly southern [[Russia]].\n\n==Holy mysteries (sacraments)==\nAccording to Orthodox theology, the purpose of the Christian life is to attain ''[[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]]'', the mystical union of mankind with God. This union is understood as both collective and individual. St. [[Athanasius of Alexandria]] wrote concerning the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] that, \"He (Jesus) was made man that we might be made god (\u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03b7\u03b8\u1ff6\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd).\"<ref>Athanasius of Alexandria, ''[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf204.vii.ii.i.html On the Incarnation of the Word]'', [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf204.vii.ii.liv.html \u00a7&nbsp;54].  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417094550/http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf204.vii.ii.liv.html |date=April 17, 2009 }}</ref> See {{bibleverse|2|Peter|1:4|KJV}}, {{bibleverse || John|10:34\u201336|KJV}}, {{bibleverse || Psalm|82:6|KJV}}. The entire life of the church is oriented towards making this possible and facilitating it.\n\nIn the Eastern Orthodox Church the terms \"mystery\" or \"the mysteries\" refer to the process of ''theosis''. While it is understood that God theoretically can do anything instantly and invisibly, it is also understood that he generally chooses to use material substance as a medium in order to reach people. The limitations are those of mankind, not God. Matter is not considered to be evil by the Eastern Orthodox. Water, oil, bread, wine, etc., all are means by which God reaches out to allow people to draw closer to him. How this process works is a \"mystery\" and cannot be defined in human terms. These mysteries are surrounded by prayer and symbolism so that their true meaning will not be forgotten.\n\nThose things which in the West are often termed [[sacraments]] or [[sacramentals]] are known among the Eastern Orthodox as the \"sacred mysteries\". While the Roman Catholic Church numbers seven sacraments, and many Protestant groups list two (baptism and the Eucharist) or even none, the Eastern Orthodox do not limit the number. However, for the sake of convenience, [[catechism]]s will often speak of the seven great mysteries. Among these are [[Holy Communion]] (the most direct connection), [[baptism]], [[Chrismation]], [[Confession (religion)|confession]], [[unction]], [[matrimony]], and [[ordination]]. But the term also properly applies to other sacred actions such as monastic [[tonsure]] or the blessing of [[Holy water in Eastern Christianity|holy water]], and involves fasting, almsgiving, or an act as simple as lighting a candle, burning incense, praying or asking God's blessing on food.{{sfn|Ware|1993|pp=274\u2013277}}\n\n===Baptism===\n[[File:GreekOrthodoxBaptism1.jpg|thumb|right|An Orthodox baptism]]\n\n[[Baptism]] is the mystery which transforms the old and sinful person into a new and pure one; the old life, the sins, any mistakes made are gone and a clean slate is given. Through baptism a person is united to the [[Body of Christ]] by becoming a member of the Orthodox Church. During the service, [[Holy water in Eastern Christianity|water]] is blessed. The catechumen is fully immersed in the water three times in the name of the Trinity. This is considered to be a death of the \"old man\" by participation in the crucifixion and burial of Christ, and a rebirth into new life in Christ by participation in his resurrection.{{sfn|Ware|1993|pp=277\u2013278}} Properly a new name is given, which becomes the person's name.\n\nChildren of Orthodox families are normally baptised shortly after birth. Converts to Orthodoxy are usually formally baptised into the Orthodox Church, though exceptions are sometimes made. Those who have left Orthodoxy and adopted a new religion, if they return to their Orthodox roots, are usually received back into the church through the mystery of Chrismation.\n\nProperly, the mystery of baptism is administered by bishops and priests; however, in emergencies any Orthodox Christian can baptise.{{sfn|Ware|1993|p=278}} In such cases, should the person survive the emergency, it is likely that the person will be properly baptised by a priest at some later date. This is not considered to be a second baptism, nor is it imagined that the person is not already Orthodox, but rather it is a fulfillment of the proper form.\n\nThe service of Baptism used in Orthodox churches has remained largely unchanged for over 1500 years. This fact is witnessed to by St. [[Cyril of Jerusalem]] (d. 386), who, in his ''Discourse on the Sacrament of Baptism'', describes the service in much the same way as is currently in use.\n\n===Chrismation===\n[[Chrismation]] (sometimes called [[confirmation]]) is the mystery by which a baptised person is granted the gift of the [[Holy Spirit]] through anointing with Holy [[Chrism]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oca.org/OCchapter.asp?SID=2&ID=52 |title=The Orthodox Faith |author=Fr. Thomas Hopko |year= 1981|website= |publisher=St. Vladimir's Seminary Press |accessdate=11 November 2013}}</ref>{{sfn|Ware|1993|pp=278\u2013279}} It is normally given immediately after baptism as part of the same service, but is also used to receive lapsed members of the Orthodox Church.{{sfn|Harakas|1987|pp=56\u201357}} As baptism is a person's participation in the death and resurrection of Christ, so Chrismation is a person's participation in the coming of the Holy Spirit at [[Pentecost]].<ref name=\"ware1993p279\">{{harvnb|Ware|1993|p=279}}</ref>\n\nA baptised and chrismated Orthodox Christian is a full member of the church and may receive the Eucharist regardless of age.<ref name=ware1993p279 />\n\nThe creation of Chrism may be accomplished by any bishop at any time, but usually is done only once a year, often when a synod of bishops convenes for its annual meeting. (Some autocephalous churches get their chrism from others.) Anointing with it substitutes for the laying-on of hands described in the New Testament, even when an instrument such as a brush is used.{{sfn|Harakas|1987|p=57}}\n\n===Holy Communion (Eucharist)===\n[[File:Liturgy St James 1.jpg|thumb|Eucharistic elements prepared for the Divine Liturgy|alt=]]The [[Eucharist]] is at the center of Orthodox Christianity. In practice, it is the partaking of the [[Body of Christ|body]] and [[blood of Jesus Christ]] in the midst of the Divine Liturgy with the rest of the church. The bread and wine are believed to become the genuine body and blood of the Christ [[Jesus]] through the operation of the Holy Spirit. The Orthodox Church has never described exactly how this occurs, or gone into the detail that the Catholic Church has in the West.\n\nCommunion is given only to baptised and chrismated Orthodox Christians who have prepared by fasting, prayer and confession. The priest will administer the gifts with a spoon, called a \"cochlear\", directly into the recipient's mouth from the chalice.{{sfn|Ware|1993|p=287}} From baptism young infants and children are carried to the chalice to receive holy communion.<ref name=ware1993p279 />\n\nBecause of the Orthodox understanding of mankind's fallen nature in general those who wish to commune prepare themselves in a way that reflects mankind in paradise. First, they prepare by having their confession heard and the prayer of repentance read over them by a priest. They will increase their prayer rule, adding the prescribed prayers in preparation for communing. Finally, they will fast completely from food and drink from the evening of the previous day (usually sunset on Saturday if communing on Sunday).\n\n===Repentance (Confession)===\n{{Main|Confession (religion)}}\n\nOrthodox Christians who have committed sins but repent of them, and who wish to reconcile themselves to God and renew the purity of their original [[baptism]]s, confess their sins to God before a spiritual guide who offers advice and direction to assist the individual in overcoming their sin. Parish priests commonly function as spiritual guides, but such guides can be any person, male or female (not commonly a layperson but in these cases monks or nuns), who has been given a blessing to hear confessions. Spiritual guides are chosen very carefully as this is a mandate that once chosen must be obeyed. Having confessed, the penitent then has his or her parish priest read the prayer of absolution over them.\n\nSin is not viewed by the Orthodox as a stain on the soul that needs to be wiped out, or a legal transgression that must be set right by a punitive sentence, but rather as a mistake made by the individual with the opportunity for spiritual growth and development. An act of [[penance]] (''epitemia''), if the spiritual guide requires it, is never formulaic, but rather is directed toward the individual and their particular problem, as a means of establishing a deeper understanding of the mistake made, and how to effect its cure. Because full participatory membership is granted to infants, it is not unusual for even small children to confess; though the scope of their culpability is far less than an older child, still their opportunity for spiritual growth remains the same.\n\n===Marriage===\n{{further|Marriage in the Eastern Orthodox Church}}\n[[File:Wedding of Nicholas II and Alexandra Feodorovna by Laurits Tuxen (1895, Hermitage).jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The wedding of Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia]].]]\nFrom the Orthodox perspective, marriage is one of the holy mysteries or sacraments. As well as in many other Christian traditions, for example in Catholicism, it serves to unite a woman and a man in eternal union and love before God, with the purpose of following Christ and his Gospel and raising up a faithful, holy family through their holy union.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/letters/documents/hf_jp-ii_let_02021994_families_en.html Letter to Families by Pope John Paul II] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110405033300/https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/letters/documents/hf_jp-ii_let_02021994_families_en.html |date=April 5, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book| author = John Meyendorff| title = Marriage: An Orthodox Perspective| url = https://books.google.com/?id=YSSCUO1tonkC&pg=PA13| year = 1975| publisher = St. Vladimir's Seminary Press| isbn = 978-0-913836-05-7| page = 13| accessdate = 2016-02-20 }}</ref> The church understands marriage to be the union of one man and one woman, and certain Orthodox leaders have spoken out strongly in opposition to the civil institution of [[same-sex marriage]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://saintandrew.net/documents/FINALOrthodoxBishopsProp8Statement.pdf |title=Statement of Orthodox Christian Bishops |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610200407/http://saintandrew.net/documents/FINALOrthodoxBishopsProp8Statement.pdf |archivedate=10 June 2011 |url-status = dead|df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oca.org/news/590 |title=OCA Reaffirms SCOBA Statement in Wake of Massachusetts Same-Sex Marriage Ruling |author= |website= |publisher= |accessdate=4 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nJesus said that \"when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven\" (Mk 12:25).

For the Orthodox, to say that marriage is indissoluble means that it should not be broken, the violation of such a union, perceived as holy, being an offense resulting from either adultery or the prolonged absence of one of the partners. Thus, permitting remarriage is an act of compassion of the church towards sinful man.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orthodoxresearchinstitute.org/articles/liturgics/athenagoras_remarriage.htm|title=Marriage, Divorce and Remarriage in the Orthodox Church: Economia and Pastoral Guidance|publisher=The Orthodox research Institute|author=Mgr. Athenagoras Peckstadt, Bishop of Sinope|date=18 May 2005|accessdate=19 November 2008}}</ref> Ecclesiastically divorced Orthodox (not civilly divorced only) are usually allowed to remarry in the Orthodox Church, though there is usually imposed on them a fairly severe penance by their bishop and the services for a second marriage in this case are more penitential than joyful. Widows are permitted to remarry without repercussion and their second marriage is considered just as valid as the first. One exception to this rule is the clergy and their wives. Should a married priest die, it is normal that his wife will retire to a monastery once their children are out of the house. Widowed priests are not allowed to remarry (no priest may be married after his ordination) and also frequently end up in monasteries.\n\nThe service of marriage in the Orthodox Church has two distinct parts: the betrothal (engagement) and the crowning. There is no exchange of vows. There is a set expectation of the obligations incumbent on a married couple, and whatever promises they may have privately to each other are their responsibility to keep.\n\n===Holy orders===\n[[File:Orthodox clergy.jpg|thumb|Clergy at All Saints' Antiochian Orthodox Church, Raleigh, United States (L to R): priest, two deacons, bishop.]]\nSince its founding, the church spread to different places and its leaders in each region came to be known as ''episkopoi'' (\"overseers\", plural of ''episkopos'', overseer\u2014Gr. \u1f10\u03c0\u03af\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2), which became \"[[bishop]]\" in English. The other [[Holy orders|ordained]] roles are ''presbyter'' (Gr. {{lang|grc|\u03c0\u03c1\u03b5\u03c3\u03b2\u03cd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2}}, elder), which became \"prester\" and then \"[[priest]]\" in English, and ''diakonos'' (Gr. {{lang|grc|\u03b4\u03b9\u03ac\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2}}, servant), which became \"[[deacon]]\" in English (see also [[subdeacon]]). There are numerous administrative positions among the clergy that carry additional titles.\n\nIn the Greek tradition, bishops who occupy an ancient see are called metropolitans, while the lead bishop in Greece is the archbishop. (In the Russian tradition, however, the usage of the terms \"metropolitan\" and \"archbishop\" is reversed.) Priests can be archpriests, archimandrites or protopresbyters. Deacons can also be archdeacons or protodeacons. The position of deacon is often occupied for life. The deacon also acts as an assistant to a bishop.\n\nWith the exception of bishops, who remain [[Celibacy|celibate]], the Orthodox Church has always allowed priests and deacons to be married, provided the marriage takes place before ordination. In general it is considered preferable for parish priests to be married as they often act as counsel to married couples and thus can draw on their own experience. Unmarried priests are usually monks and live in monasteries, though there are occasions when, because of a lack of married priests, a monk-priest is temporarily assigned to a parish.\n\nWidowed priests and deacons may not remarry and it is common for such members of the clergy to retire to a monastery (see [[clerical celibacy]]). This is also true of widowed wives of clergy, who do not remarry and become nuns when their children are grown. Only men are allowed to receive holy orders, although deaconesses had both liturgical and pastoral functions within the church.<ref name=\"Karras\">{{cite journal\n| doi = 10.1017/S000964070010928X\n| last = Karras\n| first = Valerie A.\n| date=June 2004\n| title = Female Deacons in the Byzantine Church\n| journal = Church History\n| volume = 73\n| issue = 2\n| pages = 272\u2013316\n| issn = 0009-6407\n| quote =\n}}</ref> However, it has fallen out of practice (the last deaconess was ordained in the 19th century).\n\nIn 2017, Patriarch Theodoros II and the Holy Synod of the Patriarchate of Alexandria decided to reinstate the order of deaconesses in the Greek Orthodox Church. In February, he appointed six nuns to be subdeacons within the church.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n===Unction===\nAnointing with oil, often called \"unction\", is one of the mysteries administered by the Orthodox Church and is not reserved only for the dying or terminally ill, but for all in need of spiritual or bodily healing. In Greece, during the Ottoman occupation, it became the custom to administer this mystery annually on [[Holy Wednesday|Great Wednesday]] to all believers; in recent decades, this custom has spread to many other locations. It is often distributed on major feast days, or any time the clergy believe it necessary for the spiritual welfare of its congregation.\n\nAccording to Orthodox teaching unction is based on the [[Epistle of James]]:\n\n<blockquote>Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer of faith will save the sick, and the Lord will raise him up. And if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven.\u2014{{bibleverse || James|5:14\u201315|KJV}}</blockquote>\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of the Orthodox Church}}\n\n===Early Church===\n[[File:Ephesus IchthysCrop.jpg|thumb|An early Christian \"[[Ichthys]]\" (''fish'') inscription from ancient [[Ephesus]]|210x210px]]\n\nFollowing Jesus Christ's [[Great Commission]] to the apostles, Christianity spread rapidly throughout the Roman Empire.

A number of influential schools of thought had arisen, particularly the [[Catechetical School of Alexandria|Alexandrian]] and [[School of Antioch|Antiochian]] philosophical approaches. Other groups, such as the [[Arians]], had also managed to gain influence. However, their positions caused theological conflicts within the Church, thus prompting the Emperor Constantine to call for a great ecumenical synod in order to define the Church's position against the growing, often widely diverging, philosophical and theological interpretations of Christianity. He made it possible for this council to meet not only by providing a location, but by offering to pay for the transportation of all the existing bishops of the Church. Most modern Christian Churches regard this synod, commonly called the [[First Council of Nicaea]] or more generally the [[First Ecumenical Council]],<ref name=ware1993 /><ref>{{cite book| author = Tom\u00e1\u0161 \u0160pidl\u00edk\n| title = The spirituality of the Christian East: a systematic handbook| year = 1986\n| isbn = 978-0-87907-879-9 }}</ref> as of major importance.\n\n=== Ecumenical councils ===\n{{Main|First seven Ecumenical Councils}}\n{{See also|State church of the Roman Empire}}\n[[File:Nicaea icon.jpg|thumb|Icon depicting [[Constantine I|the Emperor Constantine]] and the [[bishop]]s of the First Council of Nicaea (325) holding the [[Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed|Niceno\u2013Constantinopolitan Creed of 381]].]]\n\nSeveral doctrinal disputes from the 4th century onwards led to the calling of [[ecumenical council]]s. In the Orthodox Church, an ecumenical council is the supreme authority that can be invoked to resolve contested issues of the faith. As such, these councils have been held to resolve the most important theological matters that came to be disputed within the Christian Church. Many lesser disagreements were resolved through local councils in the areas where they arose, before they grew significant enough to require an ecumenical council.\n\nThere are seven councils authoritatively recognised as ecumenical:\n# The [[First Council of Nicaea|First Ecumenical Council]] was convoked by the Roman Emperor Constantine at [[Nicaea]] in 325 and presided over by the Patriarch [[Pope Alexander I of Alexandria|Alexander of Alexandria]], with over 300 bishops condemning the view of [[Arius]] that the Son is a created being inferior to the Father.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goarch.org/ourfaith/ourfaith8062|title=The First Ecumenical Council \u2013 Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2015}}</ref>\n# The [[First Council of Constantinople|Second Ecumenical Council]] was held at Constantinople in 381, presided over by the Patriarchs of Alexandria and Antioch, with 150 bishops, defining the nature of the Holy Spirit against those asserting His inequality with the other persons of the Trinity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goarch.org/ourfaith/ourfaith8065|title=The Second Ecumenical Council \u2013 Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2015}}</ref>\n# The [[First Council of Ephesus|Third Ecumenical Council]] is that of Ephesus in 431, presided over by the Patriarch of Alexandria, with 250 bishops, which affirmed that Mary is truly \"Birthgiver\" or \"Mother\" of God (''[[Theotokos]]''), contrary to the teachings of [[Nestorius]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goarch.org/ourfaith/ourfaith8066|title=The Third Ecumenical Council \u2013 Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2015}}</ref>\n# The [[Council of Chalcedon|Fourth Ecumenical Council]] is that of Chalcedon in 451, Patriarch of Constantinople presiding, 500 bishops, affirmed that Jesus is truly God and truly man, without mixture of the two natures, contrary to [[Monophysite]] teaching.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goarch.org/ourfaith/ourfaith8067|title=The Fourth Ecumenical Council \u2013 Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2015}}</ref>\n# The [[Second Council of Constantinople|Fifth Ecumenical Council]] is the second of Constantinople in 553, interpreting the decrees of Chalcedon and further explaining the relationship of the two natures of Jesus; it also condemned the alleged teachings of [[Origen]] on the pre-existence of the soul, etc.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goarch.org/ourfaith/ourfaith8068|title=The Fifth Ecumenical Council \u2013 Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2015}}</ref>\n# The [[Third Council of Constantinople|Sixth Ecumenical Council]] is the third of Constantinople in 681; it declared that Christ has two wills of his two natures, human and divine, contrary to the teachings of the [[Monothelites]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goarch.org/ourfaith/ourfaith8069|title=The Sixth Ecumenical Council \u2013 Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2015}}</ref>\n# The [[Second Council of Nicaea|Seventh Ecumenical Council]] was called under the Empress Regent [[Irene of Athens]] in 787, known as the second of Nicaea.

All Orthodox agree that the decisions of these further councils are valid; the disagreement is only whether they carry sufficient importance to be considered truly e''cumenical:''\n:8. The [[Fourth Council of Constantinople (Eastern Orthodox)|Fourth Council of Constantinople]] was called in 879. It restored St. [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]] to his See in Constantinople and condemned any alteration of the Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed of 381.\n\n:9. The [[Fifth Council of Constantinople]] was actually a series of councils held between 1341 and 1351. It affirmed the [[Hesychasm|hesychastic]] theology of St. [[Gregory Palamas]] and condemned the philosopher [[Barlaam of Calabria]].\n\nIn addition to these councils there have been a number of other significant councils meant to further define the Orthodox position. They are the Synods of Constantinople, in [[Synod of Constantinople (1484)|1484]], 1583, [[Oros of the Holy Great Church of Christ|1755]], 1819, and 1872, the [[Synod of Jassy]] (Ia\u0219i) in 1642, and the Pan-Orthodox [[Synod of Jerusalem (1672)|Synod of Jerusalem in 1672]].

Numerous [[Autocephaly|autocephalous]] churches were established in Europe: Greece, Georgia, Ukraine, as well as in Russia and Asia.\n\nIn the 530s the [[Hagia Sophia|Church of the Holy Wisdom]] (Hagia Sophia) was built in [[Constantinople]] under Emperor [[Justinian I]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archnet.org/sites/1989 |title=Hagia Sophia |publisher=Archnet |accessdate=12 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Early schisms===\nThere are the \"[[Nestorianism|Nestorian]]\" churches resulted from the reaction of the [[Council of Ephesus]] (431), which are the earliest surviving Eastern Christian churches that keep the faith of only the first two ecumenical councils, i.e., the [[First Council of Nicaea]] (325) and the [[First Council of Constantinople]] (381) as legitimate. \"Nestorian\" is an outsider's term for a tradition that predated the influence of [[Nestorius]], the origin of which might lay in certain sections of the [[School of Antioch]] or via Nestorius' teachers [[Theodore of Mopsuestia]] or [[Diodore of Tarsus]]. The modern incarnation of the \"[[Nestorian Church]]\" is commonly referred to as \"the Assyrian Church\" or fully as the [[Assyrian Church of the East]].\n\nThe church in Egypt ([[Patriarchate of Alexandria]]) split into two groups following the [[Council of Chalcedon]] (451), over a dispute about the relation between the divine and human natures of [[Jesus]]. Eventually this led to each group [[Anathema#Religious usage|anathematizing]] the other. Those that remained in communion with the other patriarchs (by accepting the Council of Chalcedon) are known today as the [[Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria]], where the adjective \"Greek\" refers to their ties to the Greek-speaking culture of the Byzantine Empire. However, those who disagreed with the findings of the Council of Chalcedon were the majority in Egypt, and today they are known as the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]], having maintained a separate patriarchate. The Coptic Orthodox Church is currently the largest Christian church in Egypt and in the whole Middle East. There was also a similar, albeit smaller scale, split in [[Syria]] ([[Patriarchate of Antioch]]), which resulted in the separation of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] from the [[Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch|Byzantine Patriarchate of Antioch]].\n\nThose who disagreed with the Council of Chalcedon are sometimes called \"[[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]]\" to distinguish them from the \"[[Eastern Orthodox]]\", who accepted the Council of Chalcedon. Oriental Orthodox are also sometimes referred to as \"non-Chalcedonians\", or \"anti-Chalcedonians\". The Oriental Orthodox Church denies that it is monophysite and prefers the term \"[[miaphysite]]\", to denote the \"united\" nature of Jesus (two natures united into one) consistent with St. Cyril's theology: \"The term union...signifies the concurrence in one reality of those things which are understood to be united\" and \"the Word who is ineffably united with it in a manner beyond all description\" ([[St. Cyril of Alexandria]], ''On the Unity of Christ''). Both the Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox churches formally believe themselves to be the continuation of the true church, although over the last several decades there has been considerable reconciliation and the prospect of reunification has been discussed.\n\n===Conversion of South and East Slavs===\n{{Further|Christianization of Bulgaria|Christianization of the Rus' Khaganate|Christianization of Kievan Rus'}}\nIn the 9th and 10th centuries, Christianity made great inroads into pagan Europe, including [[Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]] (864) and later [[Kievan Rus']] (988). This work was made possible by the work of the Byzantine-era [[saints Cyril and Methodius]]. When king [[Rastislav of Moravia]] asked Byzantium for teachers who could minister to the Moravians in their own language, [[Michael III|Byzantine emperor Michael III]] chose these two brothers. Cyril and Methodius translated the [[Bible]] and many of the prayer books. With time, as the translations prepared by them were copied by speakers of other dialects, the hybrid literary language [[Church Slavonic]] was created. Originally sent to convert the Slavs of [[Great Moravia]], Cyril and Methodius were forced to compete with [[Frankish mythology|Frankish]] missionaries from the Roman diocese. Their [[Saint Sava (disciple of Saints Cyril and Methodius)|disciples]] were driven out of Great Moravia in AD 886 and emigrated to [[Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]].<ref>A. Avenarius.

The Orthodox trace their bishops back to the apostles through [[apostolic succession]], and continue the ancient Christian practices of veneration of saints, especially Mary as the [[Theotokos]], prayers for the dead, and [[monasticism]]. Orthodoxy does not openly promote [[statuary]], although it is not expressly condemned, instead limiting itself primarily to two-dimensional iconography. Western theological concepts of [[original sin]], [[substitutionary atonement]], [[predestination]], [[purgatory]] and [[particular judgment]] are generally rejected by traditional Orthodox theologians.\n\nThe Orthodox believe themselves to be the [[Four Marks of the Church|One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church]], that is, the true Church established by Jesus Christ and placed into the care of the apostles. As almost all other Christian groups are in indirect schism with the Orthodox Church, mostly as a result of the [[East-West schism|Great Schism]] with the [[Catholic Church]] at the turn of the second Christian millennium (before the schisms of the [[Protestant Reformation]]), these other groups are viewed as being Christian, but who, to varying degrees, lack full theological orthodoxy and [[orthopraxy]]. As such, all groups outside of the Orthodox Church are not seen as being members of the church proper, but rather separated brethren who have failed to retain the fullness of the Christian faith and theology. These deviations from orthodoxy have traditionally been called [[heresy]], but due to the term's perceived pejorative connotations, some prefer the more technical designation of the term [[heterodoxy]].\n\nIn 1920, the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, published an encyclical \"addressed 'To all the Churches of Christ, wherever they may be', urging closer co-operation among separated Christians, and suggesting a 'League of Churches', parallel to the newly founded [[League of Nations]]\".<ref name=\"Ware1993\">{{cite book|last=Ware|first=Kallistos|title=The Orthodox Church|accessdate=|date=29 April 1993|publisher=Penguin Adult|language=English |isbn=978-0-14-014656-1|page=322|quote=From the beginning of the twentieth century the Ecumenical Patriarchate has shown a special concern for Christian reconciliation. At his accession in 1902, Patriarch Joachim III sent an encyclical letter to all the autocephalous Orthodox Churches, asking in particular for their opinion on relations with other Christian bodies. In January 1920 the Ecumenical Patriarchate followed this up with a bold and prophetic letter addressed 'To all the Churches of Christ, wherever they may be', urging closer co-operation among separated Christians, and suggesting a 'League of Churches', parallel to the newly founded League of Nations. Many of the ideas in this letter anticipate subsequent developments in the WCC. Constantinople, along with several of the other Orthodox Churches, was represented at the Faith and Order Conferences at Lausanne in 1927 and at Edinburgh in 1937.

This second group may include congregations whose church allows them to choose, with the proviso that the choice remains in effect at least until the end of the church year. Also in communion are the Estonian and Finnish Orthodox churches who have a dispensation to use the [[Gregorian calendar]] for all purposes. Another group is referred to as [[True Orthodoxy]] (or [[Old Calendarists]]); they are those who, without authority from their parent churches, have continued to use the old [[Julian calendar]], claiming that the [[Old Calendarists|calendar reform]] in the 1920s is in contravention of the ecumenical councils. Similarly, another group called the [[Old Believers]], separated in 1666 from the official Russian Orthodox Church as a protest against church rite reforms introduced by [[Patriarch Nikon of Moscow]]. As Eastern Orthodox Christianity is both collegial and local in structure, there is no single organization called the \"True Orthodox Church\" nor is there official recognition among the \"True Orthodox\" as to who is properly included among them. While some unions have taken place even up to the present, the majority of True Orthodox are only secondarily concerned with reunion as opposed to preservation of Eastern Orthodox teaching.\n\nThe calendar question reflects the dispute between those who wish to use a calendar which is reformed yet not Gregorian (effectively gaining the perceived benefits of the Gregorian calendar without disregarding the three anathemas issued against it in the sixteenth century), something which opponents consider unnecessary and damaging to continuity, and those who wish to maintain the traditional ecclesiastical calendar (which happens to be based on the Julian calendar), arguing that such a modern change goes against 1900 years of church tradition and was in fact perpetrated without an ecumenical council, which would surely have rejected the idea.\n\nThe dispute has led to much acrimony, and sometimes even to violence. Following canonical precepts, some adherents of the old calendar have chosen to abstain from clerical inter-communion with those synods which have embraced the new calendar until the conflict is resolved. The monastic communities on Mount Athos have provided the strongest opposition to the new calendar, and to [[Modernism in the Catholic Church|modernism]] in general, while still maintaining communion with their mother church.\n\nThe [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia]] (ROCOR) has recently united with the Moscow Patriarchate; these two branches of the Russian Orthodox Church had separated from each other in the 1920s due to the subjection of the latter to the hostile [[Soviet Union|Soviet regime]] (see [[Act of Canonical Communion with the Moscow Patriarchate|Act of Canonical Communion]]).\n\n===Main communion===\n[[File:AlexGreekCathedralFront.jpg|thumb|[[Cathedral of Evangelismos]], [[Alexandria]]]]\nThe Orthodox Church is a [[Full communion|communion]] of 14 [[Autocephaly|autocephalous]] (that is, administratively completely independent) regional churches,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ec-patr.org/dioceses.php?lang=en&id=99|title=Ecumenical Patriarchate|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2015}}</ref> plus the Orthodox Church in America and recently the [[Orthodox Church of Ukraine]].

Patriarchate, and those churches in communion with them, accusing them of heresy and placing themselves under bishops who do the same. They adhere to the use of the old Julian calendar since antiquity, claiming that the calendar reform in the 1920s is in contravention of the ecumenical councils. True Orthodox writers have argued that in missionary areas such as the United States, Orthodox ([[SCOBA]]) membership numbers may be overstated, with the comparative number of True Orthodox as up to 15% of the Orthodox population, in Russia, it has been claimed by some clergy that up to a million Russians may be True Orthodox of different jurisdictions, [[List of Christian denominations by number of members|though the total number is often cited at 1.7\u20132 million together.]]\n\nThere is no official communion of traditionalists.

Although all Old Believers groups emerged as a result of opposition to the Nikonian reform, they do not constitute a single monolithic body. Despite the emphasis on invariable adherence to the pre-Nikonian traditions, the Old Believers feature a great diversity of groups that profess different interpretations of the church tradition and often are not in communion with each other (some groups even practise re-baptism before admitting a member of another group into their midst).{{Div col|content=* [[Russian Orthodox Old-Rite Church]] ([[Belokrinitskaya Hierarchy]])\n* [[Lipovan Orthodox Old-Rite Church]] (Belokrinitskaya Hierarchy)\n* [[Russian Old-Orthodox Church]] (Novozybkovskaya Hierarchy)\n* [[Pomorian Old-Orthodox Church]] ([[Pomortsy]])\n* [[Fedoseevtsy]]}}{{divcolend}}\n\n===Churches not in communion with others===\nChurches with irregular or unresolved canonical status are entities that have carried out [[Episcopi vagantes|episcopal consecrations outside of the norms of canon law]] or whose bishops have been excommunicated by one of the 14 autocephalous churches.

The church teaches that it is the [[Four Marks of the Church|One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic]] [[One true church|church]] established by [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus Christ]] in his [[Great Commission]], and that its bishops are the [[Apostolic succession|successors]] of Christ's [[Apostle (Christian)|apostles]].<ref>Holy Bible: {{Bibleverse|Matthew|28:16\u201320|NKJV}}; {{Bibleverse|Mark|16:14\u201318|NKJV}}; {{Bibleverse|Luke|24:44\u201349|NKJV}}.</ref> It maintains that it practices the [[Eastern Orthodox Christian theology|original Christian faith]], as passed down by [[Holy Tradition|holy tradition]]. Its [[patriarchates]], reminiscent of the [[pentarchy]], and [[autocephalous]] and [[autonomous]] churches reflect a variety of [[hierarchical]] [[Eastern Orthodox Church organization|organisation]]. It recognises seven major sacraments, of which the [[Eucharist]] is the principal one, celebrated [[Divine Liturgy|liturgically]] in [[synaxis]]. The church teaches that through [[Consecration#Eucharist|consecration]] [[epiclesis|invoked]] by a [[Priesthood (Orthodox Church)|priest]], the sacrificial bread and wine become the body and blood of Christ. The [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] is [[veneration|venerated]] in the Eastern Orthodox Church as the [[Theotokos|God-bearer]], honoured in [[Marian devotions|devotions]].\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church shared [[Koinonia|communion]] with the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in the [[state church of Rome]] until the [[East\u2013West Schism]] in 1054, disputing particularly the [[Papal supremacy|authority of the Pope]]. Before the [[Council of Ephesus]] in AD 431 the [[Church of the East]] also shared in this communion, as did the [[Oriental Orthodox Churches]] before the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in AD 451, all separating primarily over [[Chalcedonian Definition|differences in]] [[Christology]].\n\nThe majority of Eastern Orthodox Christians live mainly in [[Southeast Europe|Southeast]] and [[Eastern Europe]], [[Cyprus]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and other communities in the [[Caucasus]] region, and communities in [[Siberia]] reaching the [[Russian Far East]]. There are also smaller communities in the former [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine regions]] of [[Africa]], the [[Eastern Mediterranean]], and in the [[Middle East]] where it is decreasing due to forced migration because of increased [[Persecution of Christians|religious persecution]] in recent years.<ref name=\"The Guardian\">{{cite news |author1=Harriet Sherwood |title=Christians flee growing persecution in Africa and Middle East |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/13/christians-flee-growing-persecution-africa-middle-east |newspaper=The Guardian |date=13 January 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"K4D\">{{cite web |author1=Huma Haider University of Birmingham |title=K4D The Persecution of Christians in the Middle East |url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/59786a0040f0b65dcb00000a/042-Persecution-of-Christians-in-the-Middle-East.pdf |website=Publishing Service U.K. Government |date=16 February 2017}}</ref> There are also many in other parts of the world, formed through [[diaspora]], [[Conversion to Christianity|conversions]], and [[missionary]] activity.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Name and characteristics==\nIn keeping with the church's teaching on universality and with the Nicene Creed, Orthodox authorities such as Saint [[Raphael of Brooklyn]] have insisted that the full name of the church has always included the term \"[[Catholic (term)|Catholic]]\", as in \"Holy Orthodox Catholic Apostolic Church\".{{sfn|Cleenewerck|2009|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=oeKOUb6OcG4C&pg=PA101Holy 101].

From ancient times through the first millennium, Greek was the most prevalent shared language in the demographic regions where the [[Byzantine Empire]] flourished, and Greek, being the language in which the New Testament was written, was the primary liturgical language of the church. For this reason, the eastern churches were sometimes identified as \"Greek\" (in contrast to the \"Roman\" or \"Latin\" church, which used a Latin translation of the Bible), even before the Great Schism of 1054. After 1054, \"Greek Orthodox\" or \"Greek Catholic\" marked a church as being in communion with Constantinople, much as \"Catholic\" did for communion with Rome. This identification with Greek, however, became increasingly confusing with time. Missionaries brought Orthodoxy to many regions without ethnic Greeks, where the Greek language was not spoken. In addition, struggles between Rome and Constantinople to control parts of [[Southeast Europe|Southeastern Europe]] resulted in the conversion of some churches to Rome, which then also used \"Greek Catholic\" to indicate their continued use of the Byzantine rites. Today, many of those same churches remain, while a very large number of Orthodox are not of Greek national origin, and do not use Greek as the language of worship.{{sfn|Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online || loc=[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/177174/Eastern-Orthodoxy \"Eastern Orthodoxy\"] \"Because of the use of the name \"Greek Catholics\" by the Eastern churches of the Catholic Church and the historical links of the Orthodox Catholic church with the Eastern Roman Empire and Byzantium (Constantinople), however, the [[exonym]]s in American English usage referred to it as the \"Eastern\" or \"Greek Orthodox\" Church. These terms are sometimes misleading, especially when applied to Russian or Slavic churches and to the Orthodox communities in western Europe and America.\"}} \"Eastern\", then, indicates the geographical element in the Church's origin and development, while \"Orthodox\" indicates the faith, as well as communion with the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople.<ref name=Calivas1983 /> There are additional Christian churches in the east that are in communion with neither Rome nor Constantinople, who tend to be distinguished by the category named \"Oriental Orthodox\". While the church continues officially to call itself \"Catholic\", for reasons of universality, the common title of \"Eastern Orthodox Church\" avoids casual confusion with the Roman Catholic Church.\n\n===Orthodoxy===\n[[File:Byzantinischer Mosaizist um 1000 002.jpg|thumb|[[Emperor Constantine]] presents a representation of the city of [[Constantinople]] as tribute to an enthroned Mary and baby Jesus in this church mosaic ([[Hagia Sophia]], c. 1000)]]\n\nThe first known use of the phrase \"the catholic Church\" (''he katholike ekklesia'') occurred in a letter written about 110 AD from one Greek church to another ([[Saint Ignatius of Antioch]] to the [[Smyrna]]eans). The letter states: \"Wheresoever the bishop shall appear, there let the people be, even as where Jesus may be, there is the universal [katholike] Church.\"<ref name=\"CathEnc1910_Catholic\">{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03449a.htm|encyclopedia=The Catholic Encyclopedia |title=Catholic|last=Thurston |first=Herbert |authorlink=Herbert Thurston|place=New York |publisher=Robert Appleton Company|date=1908 |accessdate=17 August 2012|editor-first=Kevin |editor-last=Knight |editor-link=Knight |volume=3}}</ref> Thus, almost from the very beginning, Christians referred to the Church as the \"One, Holy, [[Catholic (term)|Catholic]] (from the Greek \u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae, or \"according to the whole, universal\") and Apostolic Church\".{{sfn|Hardon|1981|p=[https://books.google.com/?id=3Ke37zpSv3gC&pg=PA217 217]}} The Eastern Orthodox Church claims that it is today the continuation and preservation of that same early Church.\n\nA number of other Christian churches also make a similar claim: the Roman [[Catholic Church]], the [[Anglican Communion]], the [[Assyrian Church of the East|Assyrian Church]] and the [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]]. In the Eastern Orthodox view, the Assyrians and Orientals left the Orthodox Church in the years following the Third Ecumenical [[Council of Ephesus]] (431) and the Fourth Ecumenical [[Council of Chalcedon]] (451), respectively, in their refusal to accept those councils' [[Christology|Christological]] definitions. Similarly, the churches in Rome and Constantinople separated in an event known as the [[East\u2013West Schism]], traditionally dated to the year 1054, although it was more a gradual process than a sudden break. The [[Church of England]] separated from the Catholic Church, not directly from the Eastern Orthodox Church, for the first time in the 1530s (and, after a brief reunion in 1555, again finally in 1558). Thus, though it was united to Orthodoxy when established through the work of [[Saint Augustine of Canterbury]] in the early 7th century, its separation from Orthodoxy came about indirectly through the [[Holy See|See of Rome]].\n\nTo all these churches, the claim to [[catholicity]] (universality, oneness with the ancient Church) is important for multiple doctrinal reasons that have more bearing internally in each church than in their relation to the others, now separated in faith. The meaning of holding to a faith that is true is the primary reason why anyone's statement of which church split off from which other has any significance at all; the issues go as deep as the schisms. The depth of this meaning in the Eastern Orthodox Church is registered first in its use of the word \"[[Orthodoxy|Orthodox]]\" itself, a union of [[Greek language|Greek]] ''orthos'' (\"straight\", \"correct\", \"true\", \"right\") and ''[[doxa]]'' (\"common belief\", from the ancient verb \u03b4\u03bf\u03ba\u03ad\u03c9-\u03b4\u03bf\u03ba\u1ff6 which is translated \"to believe\", \"to think\", \"to consider\", \"to imagine\", \"to assume\").<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Ddoke%2Fw \u03b4\u03bf\u03ba\u03ad\u03c9] in Liddell and Scott</ref>\n\nThe dual meanings of ''doxa'', with \"glory\" or \"glorification\" (of God by the Church and of the Church by God), especially in worship, yield the pair \"correct belief\" and \"true worship\". Together, these express the core of a fundamental teaching about the inseparability of belief and worship and their role in drawing the church together with Christ.{{sfn|Ware|1991|pp=16, 271}}{{sfn|Hierotheos|1998|pp=69\u201372}} The [[Bulgaria]]n and all the [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] churches use the title ''Pravoslavie'' ([[Cyrillic alphabets|Cyrillic]]: \u041f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0435), meaning \"correctness of glorification\", to denote what is in English ''Orthodoxy'', while the Georgians use the title ''Martlmadidebeli''. Several other churches in [[Europe]], [[Asia]], and [[Africa]] also came to use ''Orthodox'' in their titles, but are still distinct from the Eastern Orthodox Church as described in this article.\n\nThe term \"Eastern Church\" (the geographic east in the East\u2013West Schism) has been used to distinguish it from [[Western Christianity|western Christendom]] (the geographic West, which at first came to designate the Catholic communion, later also the various Protestant and Anglican branches). \"Eastern\" is used to indicate that the highest concentrations of the Eastern Orthodox Church presence remain in the eastern part of the Christian world, although it is growing worldwide. Orthodox Christians throughout the world use various ethnic or national jurisdictional titles, or more inclusively, the title \"Eastern Orthodox\", \"Orthodox Catholic\", or simply \"Orthodox\".<ref name=\"Calivas1983\">{{cite web|url=http://www.goarch.org/ourfaith/ourfaith7052/|title=The Orthodox Church: An Introduction|date=9 January 1996|website=[[Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America]]|last1=Fitzgerald|first1=Thomas|accessdate=11 June 2016|url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603103953/http://www.goarch.org/ourfaith/ourfaith7052|archivedate=3 June 2016|df=}}</ref>\n\nWhat unites Orthodox Christians is the catholic faith as carried through holy tradition. That faith is expressed most fundamentally in scripture and worship,{{sfn|Ware|1991|pp=212\u2013213}} and the latter most essentially through baptism and in the [[Divine Liturgy]].{{sfn|Ware|1991|p=282}} Orthodox Christians proclaim the faith lives and breathes by God's energies in communion with the church. Inter-communion is the litmus test by which all can see that two churches share the same faith; lack of inter-communion (excommunication, literally \"out of communion\") is the sign of different faiths, even though some central theological points may be shared. The sharing of beliefs can be highly significant, but it is not the full measure of the faith according to the Orthodox.\n\nThe lines of even this test can blur, however, when differences that arise are not due to doctrine, but to recognition of jurisdiction. As the Eastern Orthodox Church has spread into the west and over the world, the church as a whole has yet to sort out all the inter-jurisdictional issues that have arisen in the expansion, leaving some areas of doubt about what is proper church governance.{{sfn|Ware|1991|pp=180\u2013199}} And as in the ancient church persecutions, the aftermath of [[Persecution of Christians in the Soviet Union|persecutions of Christians in communist nations]] has left behind both some governance and some faith issues that have yet to be completely resolved.{{sfn|Ware|1991|pp=152\u2013179}}\n\nAll members of the Eastern Orthodox Church profess the same faith, regardless of race or nationality, jurisdiction or local custom, or century of birth. Holy tradition encompasses the understandings and means by which that unity of faith is transmitted across boundaries of time, geography, and culture. It is a continuity that exists only inasmuch as it lives within Christians themselves.{{sfn|Ware|1991|pp=203\u2013204}} It is not static, nor an observation of rules, but rather a sharing of observations that spring both from within and also in keeping with others, even others who lived lives long past. The church proclaims the Holy Spirit maintains the unity and consistency of holy tradition to preserve the integrity of the faith within the church, as given in the scriptural promises.<ref>Holy Bible: {{Bibleverse|John|14:17|NKJV}}; {{Bibleverse|John|14:26|NKJV}}</ref>\n\nThe shared beliefs of Orthodoxy, and its theology, exist within Holy Tradition and cannot be separated from it, for their meaning is not expressed in mere words alone.{{sfn|Ware|1991|p=215}} Doctrine cannot be understood unless it is prayed.<ref>{{citation |last1=Evagrius the Solitary |authorlink1=Evagrius Ponticus |chapter=On Prayer, 60 |origyear=4th century|editor1-last=Migne |editor1-first=J.P. |title=Patrologia Graeca |page=1180B |volume=79 |location=Paris |publisher=Imprimerie Catholique |year=1857\u20131866 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w4_YAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage |accessdate=15 May 2014 |ref=none }}</ref> Doctrine must also be lived in order to be prayed, for without action, the prayer is idle and empty, a mere vanity, and therefore the theology of demons.<ref>{{citation |last1=St. Maximus |authorlink1=Maximus the Confessor |chapter=Letter 20 |origyear=7th century |editor1-last=Migne |editor1-first=J.P. |title=Patrologia Graeca |page=601C |volume=91 |location=Paris |publisher=Imprimerie Catholique |year=1857\u20131866 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NsPUAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage |accessdate=15 May 2014 |ref=none }}</ref> According to these teachings of the ancient Church, no superficial belief can ever be [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]].

The doctrine of the [[Catholicity|Catholicity of the Church]], as derived from the [[Nicene Creed]], is essential to Eastern Orthodox [[ecclesiology]]. The term ''Catholicity of the Church'' ([[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u039a\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u1f18\u03ba\u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03af\u03b1\u03c2}}) is used in its original sense, as a designation for the [[Universality of the Church]], centered around Christ. Therefore, the Eastern Orthodox notion of [[catholicity]] is not centered around any singular see, unlike Catholicism, that has one earthly center.\n\nDue to the influence of the Catholic Church in the west, where the [[English language]] itself developed, the words \"catholic\" and \"catholicity\" are sometimes used to refer to that church specifically. However, the more prominent dictionary sense given for general use is still the one shared by other languages, implying breadth and universality, reflecting comprehensive scope.{{sfn|American Heritage Dict|5th ed|p=294 [http://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=catholicity \"catholicity\"]}} In a Christian context, the Christian Church, as identified with the original Church founded by Christ and his apostles, is said to be catholic (or universal) in regard to its union with Christ in faith. Just as Christ is indivisible, so are union with him and faith in him, whereby the Church is \"universal\", unseparated, and comprehensive, including all who share that faith. Orthodox bishop [[Kallistos Ware]] has called that \"simple Christianity\".{{sfn|Ware|1991|p=16}} That is the sense of early and [[patristic]] usage wherein the church usually refers to itself as the \"Catholic Church\",{{sfn|Encyclopedia of Christianity|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/?id=7ly4DgtT3LkC&pg=PA867 867]}}{{sfn|Leith|1982|p=[https://books.google.com/?id=saFgJRjaPwcC&pg=PA486 486]}} whose faith is the \"Orthodox faith\". It is also the sense within the phrase \"One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church\", found in the [[Nicene Creed]], and referred to in Orthodox worship, e.g. in the litany of the catechumens in the Divine Liturgy.\n\nWith the mutual excommunications of the East\u2013West Schism in 1054, the churches in Rome and Constantinople each viewed the other as having departed from the [[One true church|true Church]], leaving a smaller but still-catholic church in place. Each retained the \"Catholic\" part of its title, the \"''Roman'' Catholic Church\" (or [[Catholic Church]]) on the one hand, and the \"''Orthodox'' Catholic Church\" on the other, each of which was defined in terms of inter-communion with either Rome or Constantinople. While the Eastern Orthodox Church recognises what it shares in common with other churches, including the Catholic Church, it sees catholicity in terms of complete union in communion and faith, with the Church throughout all time, and the sharing remains incomplete when not shared fully.\n\n==Organisation and leadership==\n{{Main|Orthodox Church organization}}The religious authority for Eastern Orthodoxy is not a patriarch or the Bishop of Rome as in Catholicism, nor the Bible as in [[Protestantism]], but the scriptures as interpreted by the seven ecumenical councils of the [[State church of the Roman Empire|Imperial Roman Church]]. The Eastern Orthodox Church is a fellowship of \"[[Autocephaly|autocephalous]]\" (Greek for self-headed) churches, with the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]] being the only autocephalous head who holds the title ''[[primus inter pares]]'', meaning \"first among equals\" in Latin.

Bishops are equal in authority and cannot interfere in the jurisdiction of another bishop. Administratively, these bishops and their territories are organised into various [[autocephaly|autocephalous]] groups or [[synod]]s of [[bishop]]s who gather together at least twice a year to discuss the state of affairs within their respective sees. While bishops and their autocephalous synods have the ability to administer guidance in individual cases, their actions do not usually set precedents that affect the entire Eastern Orthodox Church. Bishops are almost always chosen from the monastic ranks and must remain unmarried.\n\n=== Church councils ===\n{{More citations needed section|date=July 2019}}\nThere have been a number of times when alternative theological ideas arose to challenge the Orthodox faith. At such times the Orthodox communion deemed it necessary to convene a general or [[Ecumenical council|\"great\" council]] of all available bishops throughout the world. The Orthodox Church holds that [[first seven Ecumenical Councils|seven ecumenical councils]], held between the 4th and the 8th centuries, are authoritative.\n\n[[File:Rylands Nicene Creed papyrus.jpg|thumb|Oldest extant manuscript of the [[Nicene Creed]], dated to the 5th Century|256x256px]]\n\nThe ecumenical councils followed a democratic form, with each bishop having one vote. Though present and allowed to speak before the council, members of the [[Roman Empire|Imperial Roman]]/[[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] court, abbots, priests, deacons, monks and laymen were not allowed to vote. The primary goal of these great synods was to verify and confirm the fundamental beliefs of the [[Great Church|Great Christian Church]] as truth, and to remove as heresy any false teachings that would threaten the Church. The [[Pope|Pope of Rome]] at that time held the position of \"[[Primus inter pares]]\" (\"first among equals\") and, while he was not present at any of the councils, he continued to hold this title until the [[East\u2013West Schism]] of 1054.\n\nOther councils have helped to define the Eastern Orthodox position, specifically the [[Quinisext Council]], the Synods of [[Constantinople]], [[Fourth Council of Constantinople (Eastern Orthodox)|879\u2013880]], [[Fifth Council of Constantinople|1341, 1347, 1351]], 1583, 1819, and [[Phyletism|1872]], the [[Synod of Jassy]] (Ia\u0219i), 1642, and the Pan-Orthodox [[Synod of Jerusalem (1672)|Synod of Jerusalem]], 1672; the [[Pan-Orthodox Council]], held in Greece in 2016, was the only such Eastern Orthodox council in modern times.\n\nAccording to Orthodox teaching the position of \"first among equals\" gives no additional power or authority to the bishop that holds it, but rather that this person sits as organizational head of a council of equals (like a president). His words and opinions carry no more insight or wisdom than any other bishop. It is believed that the Holy Spirit guides the Eastern Orthodox Church through the decisions of the entire council, not one individual. Additionally it is understood that even the council's decisions must be accepted by the entire Orthodox Church in order for them to be valid.\n\nOne of the decisions made by the [[First Council of Constantinople]] (the second ecumenical council, meeting in 381) and supported by later such councils was that the Patriarch of Constantinople should be given equal honor to the Pope of Rome since Constantinople was considered to be the \"[[New Rome]]\". According to the third canon of the second ecumenical council: \"Because it is new Rome, the bishop of Constantinople is to enjoy the privileges of honor ''after'' the bishop of Rome.\" This means that both enjoy the same privileges because they are both bishops of the imperial capitals, but the bishop of Rome will precede the bishop of Constantinople since Old Rome precedes New Rome.\n\nThe 28th canon of the fourth ecumenical council clarified this point by stating: \"For the Fathers rightly granted privileges to the throne of Old Rome because it was the royal city. And the One Hundred and Fifty most religious Bishops (i.e. the second ecumenical council in 381) actuated by the same consideration, gave equal privileges to the most holy throne of New Rome, justly judging that the city which is honoured with the Sovereignty and the Senate, and enjoys equal privileges with the old imperial Rome, should in ecclesiastical matters also be magnified as she is.\"\n\nBecause of the schism the Eastern Orthodox no longer recognise the primacy of the Pope of Rome. The Patriarch of Constantinople therefore, like the Pope before him, now enjoys the title of \"first among equals\".\n\n===Adherents===\n{{Further|Eastern Orthodoxy by country}}\n[[File:Eastern Orthodoxy by country.png|thumb|'''Distribution <!-- among who? -->of Eastern Orthodox Christians in the world by country:'''\n{{legend|#000055|More than 75%}}\n{{legend|#0000aa|50\u201375%}}\n{{legend|#0000ff|20\u201350%}}\n{{legend|#5555ff|5\u201320%}}\n{{legend|#aaaaff|1\u20135%}}\n{{legend|#b4c8ff|Below 1%, but has local [[autocephaly]]}}\n|211x211px]]\n<!---This article and hence this section is about Eastern Orthodoxy.

(philosophy)|hypostases]]''), without overlap or [[Sabellianism|modality]] among them, who each have one divine [[essence]] (''ousia'' Greek \u03bf\u1f50\u03c3\u03af\u03b1)\u2014uncreated, immaterial and [[eternity|eternal]].{{sfn|Ware|1993|pp=208\u2013211}} These three persons are typically distinguished by their relation to each other. The [[God the Father|Father]] is eternal and not begotten and does not proceed from any, the [[God the Son|Son]] is eternal and begotten of the Father, and the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]] is eternal and proceeds from the Father. Orthodox doctrine regarding the Trinity is summarised in the [[Nicene Creed#Niceno\u2013Constantinopolitan Creed|Nicene Creed]].{{sfn|Ware|1993|p=202}}\n\nIn discussing God's relationship to his creation, Orthodox theology [[Essence\u2013Energies distinction|distinguishes]] between God's eternal essence, which is totally transcendent, and his ''uncreated energies'', which is how he reaches humanity. The God who is transcendent and the God who touches mankind are one and the same. That is, these energies are not something that proceed from God or that God produces, but rather they are God himself: distinct, yet inseparable from God's inner being.{{sfn|Ware|1993|pp=67\u201369}}\n\nIn understanding the Trinity as \"one God in three persons\", \"three persons\" is not to be emphasised more than \"one God\", and vice versa. While the three persons are distinct, they are united in one divine essence, and their oneness is expressed in community and action so completely that they cannot be considered separately. For example, their salvation of mankind is an activity engaged in common: \"Christ became man by the good will of the Father and by the cooperation of the Holy Spirit. Christ sends the Holy Spirit who proceeds from the Father, and the Holy Spirit forms Christ in our hearts, and thus God the Father is glorified.\" Their \"communion of essence\" is \"indivisible\". Trinitarian terminology\u2014essence, hypostasis, etc.\u2014are used \"philosophically\", \"to answer the ideas of the heretics\", and \"to place the terms where they separate error and truth.\"{{sfn|Hierotheos|1998|pp=128\u2013130}} The words do what they can do, but the nature of the Trinity in its fullness is believed to remain beyond man's comprehension and expression, a holy mystery that can only be experienced.\n\n===Sin, salvation, and the incarnation===\n[[File:Ioann Damaskin ikona.jpg|alt=|thumb|[[John of Damascus]]]]\nAccording to the Eastern Orthodox faith, at some point in the beginnings of human existence, humanity was faced with a choice: to learn the difference between good and evil through observation or through participation. The biblical story of [[Adam and Eve]] relates this choice by mankind to participate in evil, accomplished through disobedience to God's command. Both the intent and the action were separate from God's will; it is that separation that defines and marks any operation as sin. The separation from God caused the loss of (fall from) his grace, a severing of mankind from his creator and the source of his life. The end result was the diminishment of human nature and its subjection to death and corruption, an event commonly referred to as the \"fall of man\".\n\nWhen Orthodox Christians refer to fallen nature they are not saying that human nature has become evil in itself. Human nature is still formed in the image of God; humans are still God's creation, and God has never created anything evil, but fallen nature remains open to evil intents and actions. It is sometimes said among Orthodox that humans are \"inclined to sin\"; that is, people find some sinful things attractive. It is the nature of temptation to make sinful things seem the more attractive, and it is the fallen nature of humans that seeks or succumbs to the attraction. Orthodox Christians reject the Augustinian position that the descendants of Adam and Eve are actually guilty of the original sin of their ancestors.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Matusiak |first1=Fr. John |title=Original Sin |publisher=Orthodox Church in America |url=http://www.oca.org/QA.asp?ID=3&SID=3 |accessdate=23 May 2014 |ref=none }}</ref> But just as any species begets its own kind, so fallen humans beget fallen humans, and from the beginning of humanity's existence people lie open to sinning by their own choice.\n\nSince the fall of man, then, it has been mankind's dilemma that no human can restore his nature to union with God's grace; it was necessary for God to effect another change in human nature. Orthodox Christians believe that Christ Jesus was both God and Man absolutely and completely, having two natures indivisibly: eternally begotten of the Father in his divinity, he was born in his humanity of a woman, Mary, by her consent, through descent of the Holy Spirit. He lived on earth, in time and history, as a man. As a man he also died, and went to the place of the dead, which is [[Christian views on Hades|Hades]]. But being God, neither death nor Hades could contain him, and he rose to life again, in his humanity, by the power of the Holy Spirit, thus destroying the power of Hades and of death itself.{{sfn|Chrysostom|400|loc=[[Paschal Homily]]}} Through God's participation in humanity, Christ's human nature, perfected and unified with his divine nature, ascended into heaven, there to reign in communion with the Father and Holy Spirit.\n\nBy these acts of salvation, Christ provided fallen mankind with the path to escape its fallen nature. The Eastern Orthodox Church teaches that through baptism into Christ's death, and a person's death unto sin in repentance, with God's help mankind can also rise with Christ into heaven, healed of the breach of man's fallen nature and restored to God's grace. To Orthodox Christians, this process is what is meant by \"salvation,\" which consists of the Christian life. The ultimate goal is [[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]] an even closer union with God and closer likeness to God than existed in the [[Garden of Eden]]. This process is called [[Divinization (Christian)|Deification]] or \"God became man that man might become 'god'\". However, it must be emphasised that Orthodox Christians do not believe that man becomes God in his essence, or a god in his own nature. More accurately, Christ's salvific work enables man in his human nature to become \"partakers of the Divine nature\" (2 Peter 1:4); that is to say, man is united to God in Christ.\n\nThrough Christ's destruction of Hades' power to hold humanity hostage, he made the path to salvation effective for all the righteous who had died from the beginning of time\u2014saving many, including Adam and Eve, who are remembered in the Church as saints.{{sfn|St. Athanasius|1982|loc=Ch. 2\u20133, p. 318}}\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox reject the idea that Christ died to give God \"satisfaction\" as taught by [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]], or as a punitive substitute as taught by the Reformers. Sin (separation from God, who is the source of all life) is its own punishment, capable of imprisoning the soul in an existence without life, without anything good, and without hope: hell by any measure. Life on earth is God's gift, to give humankind opportunity to make their choice real: separation or union.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n===Resurrection of Christ===\n[[File:1678. \u0421\u0430\u0448\u044d\u0441\u0446\u0435 \u045e \u043f\u0435\u043a\u043b\u0430.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|A 17th-century [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] icon of the Resurrection]]\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church understands the death and resurrection of Jesus to be real historical events, as described in the gospels of the [[New Testament]]. Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is believed to, according to Orthodox teaching, in his humanity be (that is, in history) crucified, and died, descending into Hades ([[Sheol]]), the place of the dead, as all humans do. But he, alone among humans, has two natures, one human, one divine, which are indivisible and inseparable from each other through the mystery of the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnation]]. Hades could not restrain the infinite God. Christ in his divine nature [[Harrowing of Hell|captured the keys of Hades]] and broke the bonds which had imprisoned the human souls who had been held there through their separation from God.\n\nNeither could death contain the Son of God, the Fountain of Life, who arose from death even in his human nature. Not only this, but he opened the gates of Hades to all the righteous dead of past ages, rescuing them from their fallen human nature and restoring them to a nature of grace with God, bringing them back to life, this time in God's heavenly kingdom. And this path he opened to all who choose to follow him in time yet to come, thus saving the human race. Thus the Eastern Orthodox proclaim each year at the time of Pascha ([[Easter]]), that Christ \"trampled down death by death, and on those in the tombs bestowed life.\"\n\nThe celebration of the [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]] of Christ at Pascha is the central event in the [[Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar|liturgical year]] of the Eastern Orthodox Church. According to Orthodox tradition, each human being may partake of this immortality, which would have been impossible without the Resurrection; it is the main promise held out by God in the [[New Testament]]. Every holy day of the Eastern Orthodox [[liturgical]] year relates to the Resurrection directly or indirectly. Every Sunday is especially dedicated to celebrating the Resurrection and the triune God, representing a mini-Pascha. In the liturgical commemorations of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion of Christ]] during [[Holy Week]] there are frequent allusions to the ultimate victory at its completion.\n\n===Christian life===\nChurch teaching is that Orthodox Christians, through baptism, enter a new life of salvation through repentance whose purpose is to share in the life of God through the work of the Holy Spirit. The Eastern Orthodox Christian life is a spiritual pilgrimage in which each person, through the [[imitation of Christ]] and ''[[hesychasm]]'',{{sfn|Hierotheos|1998|pp=234\u2013237,(241=Glossary)}} cultivates the practice of unceasing prayer.

The church includes the Christian saints from all times, and also judges, prophets and righteous Jews of the first covenant, Adam and Eve, even the angels and heavenly hosts.{{sfn|Hierotheos|1998|pp=25\u201330}} In Orthodox services, the earthly members together with the heavenly members worship God as one community in Christ, in a union that transcends time and space and joins heaven to earth. This unity of the Church is sometimes called the ''communion of the saints''.{{sfn|Hierotheos|1998|p=23}}\n\n===Virgin Mary and other saints===\n[[File:Tinos panagia evangelistria 200707 04.jpg|thumb|[[Our Lady of Tinos]] is the major [[Marian shrine]] in [[Greece]]]]\n[[File:Vladimirskaya.jpg|thumb|The [[Theotokos of Vladimir]], one of the most venerated of Orthodox Christian icons of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]]|298x298px]]\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church believes death and the separation of body and soul to be unnatural\u2014a result of the [[Fall of Man]]. They also hold that the congregation of the church comprises both the living and the dead. All persons currently in heaven are considered to be [[saint]]s, whether their names are known or not. There are, however, those saints of distinction whom God has revealed as particularly good examples. When a saint is revealed and ultimately recognised by a large portion of the church a service of official recognition ([[canonization]]) is celebrated.\n\nThis does not \"make\" the person a saint; it merely recognises the fact and announces it to the rest of the church. A day is prescribed for the saint's celebration, hymns composed and icons created. Numerous saints are celebrated on each day of the year. They are venerated (shown great respect and love) but not worshipped, for worship is due God alone (this view is also held by the [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]] and [[Catholic Church]]es). In showing the saints this love and requesting their prayers, the Eastern Orthodox manifest their belief that the saints thus assist in the process of salvation for others.\n\nPre-eminent among the saints is the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]] (commonly referred to as ''Theotokos'' or ''Bogoroditsa'') (\"[[Mother of God]]\"). In Orthodox theology, the Mother of God is the fulfillment of the Old Testament archetypes revealed in the [[Ark of the Covenant]] (because she carried the New Covenant in the person of Christ) and the [[burning bush]] that appeared before [[Moses]] (symbolizing the Mother of God's carrying of God without being consumed).<ref>{{cite book|last=Meyendorff|first=Gregory of Nyssa; transl., introduction and notes by Abraham J.

The Theotokos, in Orthodox teaching, was chosen by God and she freely co-operated in that choice to be the Mother of Jesus Christ, the God-man.\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox believe that Christ, from the moment of his conception, was both fully God and fully human. Mary is thus called the ''Theotokos'' or ''Bogoroditsa'' as an affirmation of the divinity of the one to whom she gave birth. It is also believed that her virginity was not compromised in conceiving God-incarnate, that she was not harmed and that she remained forever a virgin. Scriptural references to \"brothers\" of Christ are interpreted as kin, given that the word \"brother\" was used in multiple ways, as was the term \"father\". Due to her unique place in salvation history, Mary is honoured above all other saints and especially venerated for the great work that God accomplished through her.{{sfn|Ware|1993|pp=257\u2013258}}\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church regards the bodies of all saints as holy, made such by participation in the holy mysteries, especially the communion of Christ's holy body and blood, and by the indwelling of the Holy Spirit within the church. Indeed, that persons and physical things can be made holy is a cornerstone of the doctrine of the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]], made manifest also directly by God in Old Testament times through his dwelling in the Ark of the Covenant. Thus, physical items connected with saints are also regarded as holy, through their participation in the earthly works of those saints. According to church teaching and tradition, God himself bears witness to this holiness of saints' [[relic]]s through the many miracles connected with them that have been reported throughout history since Biblical times, often including healing from disease and injury.{{sfn|Ware|1993|p=234}}\n\n===Eschatology===\n{{main|Christian eschatology}}\n[[File:Torcello - Santa Maria Assunta.Last Judgement.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|''Last Judgment'': 12th-century [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] mosaic from [[Torcello]] Cathedral]]\n\nOrthodox Christians believe that when a person dies the soul is temporarily separated from the body.

Iconographic depictions of the [[Last Judgment|Final Judgment]] are often portrayed on the back (western) wall of the church building to remind the departing faithful to be vigilant in their struggle against sin. Likewise it is often painted on the walls of the Trapeza (refectory) in a monastery where monks may be inspired to sobriety and detachment from worldly things while they eat.\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox believe that [[Hell in Christianity|Hell]], though often described in metaphor as punishment inflicted by God, is in reality the soul's rejection of God's infinite love which is offered freely and abundantly to everyone.\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox believe that after the Final Judgment:\n* All souls will be reunited with their [[Resurrection of the Dead|resurrected bodies]].\n* All souls will fully experience their spiritual state.\n* Having been perfected, the saints will forever progress towards a deeper and fuller love of God, which equates with eternal happiness.<ref name=soulafterdeath />\n\n===Bible===\nThe official Bible of the Eastern Orthodox Church contains the [[Septuagint]] text of the [[Old Testament]], with the [[Book of Daniel]] given in the translation by [[Theodotion]].

The east took up to a century longer to resolve the lists in use there, and ended by accepting a few additional writings from the Septuagint that did not appear in the lists of the west. The differences were small and were not considered to compromise the unity of the faith shared between east and west. They did not play a role in the eventual [[East-West Schism|schism in the 11th century]] that separated the See of Rome and the West from the See of Constantinople and the other apostolic Orthodox churches, and remained as defined essentially without controversy in the East or West for at least one thousand years. It was only in the 16th century that [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation Protestants]] challenged the lists, proclaiming a [[Biblical canon|canon]] that rejected those Old Testament books that did not appear in the 3rd-century [[Hebrew Bible]]. In response, the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches reaffirmed their accepted scriptural lists in more formal canons of their own.\n\nOnce established as Holy Scripture, there has never been any question that the Eastern Orthodox Church holds the full list of books to be venerable and beneficial for reading and study,<ref>Pomazansky, Michael, Orthodox Dogmatic Theology, pp. 33\u201334</ref> even though it informally holds some books in higher esteem than others, the four gospels highest of all.

That is a title the Eastern Orthodox Church reserves for Christ, as supported in the scriptures themselves, most explicitly in the first chapter of the gospel of John. God's Word is not hollow, like human words. \"God said, 'let there be light'; and there was light.\"<ref>Holy Bible: {{Bibleverse|Genesis|1:3|NKJV}}</ref> This is the Word which spoke the universe into being, and resonates in creation without diminution throughout all history, a Word of divine power.\n\nAs much as the Eastern Orthodox Church reveres and depends on the scriptures, they cannot compare to the Word of God's manifest action. But the Eastern Orthodox do believe that the Holy Scriptures testify to God's manifest actions in history, and that through its divine inspiration God's Word is manifested both in the scriptures themselves and in the cooperative human participation that composed them. It is in that sense that the Eastern Orthodox refer to the scriptures as \"God's Word\".\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church does not subscribe to the Protestant doctrine of ''[[sola scriptura]]''. The church has defined what Scripture is; it also interprets what its meaning is.<ref>Ware, Bishop Kallistos (Timothy), [http://orthodoxinfo.com/phronema/ware_howto.aspx ''How to Read the Bible''], retrieved 11 June 2013</ref> Christ promised: \"When He, the Spirit of truth, has come, He will guide you into all truth\".<ref>Holy Bible: {{Bibleverse|John|16:13|NKJV}}</ref> The Holy Spirit, then, is the infallible guide for the church to the interpretation of Scripture. The church depends upon those saints who, by lives lived in [[imitation of Christ]], achieving [[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]], can serve as reliable witnesses to the Holy Spirit's guidance. Individual interpretation occurs within the church and is informed by the church. It is rational and reasoned, but is not arrived at only by means of deductive reasoning.\n\nScriptures are understood to contain historical fact, poetry, idiom, metaphor, simile, moral fable, parable, prophecy and [[wisdom literature]], and each bears its own consideration in its interpretation. While divinely inspired, the text stills consists of words in human languages, arranged in humanly recognizable forms. The Eastern Orthodox Church does not oppose honest critical and historical study of the Bible.<ref name=\"Ware1991pp210-5\">{{harvnb|Ware|1991|pp=210\u2013215}}</ref> In biblical interpretation, it does not use speculations, suggestive theories, or incomplete indications, not going beyond what is fully known.\n\n===Holy Tradition and the patristic consensus===\n\"That faith which has been believed everywhere, always, and by all\", the faith taught by Jesus to the apostles, given life by the [[Holy Spirit]] at [[Pentecost]], and passed down to future generations without additions and without subtractions, is known as [[Holy Tradition|holy tradition]].{{sfn|Ware|1993|pp=195\u2013196}}<ref>Letter of 1718, in [[George Williams (priest)|George Williams]], ''The Orthodox Church of the East in the 18th Century'', p. 17</ref> Holy tradition does not change in the Eastern Orthodox Church because it encompasses those things that do not change: the nature of the one God in Trinity, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, the history of God's interactions with his peoples, the Law as given to the Israelites, all Christ's teaching as given to the disciples and Jews and recorded in scripture, including the parables, the prophecies, the miracles, and his own example to humanity in his extreme humility. It encompasses also the worship of the church, which grew out of the worship of the synagogue and temple and was extended by Christ at the last supper, and the relationship between God and his people which that worship expresses, which is also evidenced between Christ and his disciples. It includes the authority that Christ bestowed on his disciples when he made them apostles,<ref>Holy Bible: {{Bibleverse|Matthew|16:19|NKJV}}</ref> for the preserving and teaching of the faith, and for governing the organization and conduct of the church (in its administration by bishops).\n\nHoly tradition is firm, even unyielding, but not rigid or legalistic; instead, it lives and breathes within the church.<ref>[[Vladimir Lossky]], \"''Tradition is the life of the Holy Spirit in the Church.''\"</ref> For example, the New Testament was entirely written by the early church (mostly the apostles). The whole Bible was accepted as scripture by means of holy tradition practiced within the early church. The writing and acceptance took five centuries, by which time the Holy Scriptures themselves had become in their entirety a part of holy tradition.{{sfn|Ware|1991|p=205}} But holy tradition did not change, because \"that faith which has been believed everywhere, always, and by all\" remained consistent, without additions, and without subtractions. The historical development of the Divine Liturgy and other worship services and devotional practices of the church provide a similar example of extension and growth \"without change\".{{sfn|Ware|1991|p=213}}\n\nThe continuity and stability of Orthodox worship throughout the centuries is one means by which holy tradition expresses the unity of the whole church throughout time. Not only can the Eastern Orthodox of today visit a church in a place that speaks a language unknown to the visitors yet have the service remain familiar and understandable to them, but the same would hold true were any able to visit past eras. The church strives to preserve holy tradition \"unchanging\" that it may express the one unchanging faith for all time to come as well.\n\nBesides these, holy tradition includes the doctrinal definitions and statements of faith of the seven ecumenical councils, including the [[Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed]], and some later local councils, patristic writings, canon law, and icons.<ref name=\"Ware1991pp210-5\" /> Not all portions of holy tradition are held to be equally strong. Some, the Holy Scriptures foremost, certain aspects of worship, especially in the Divine Liturgy, the doctrines of the ecumenical councils, the [[Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed]], possess a verified authority that endures forever, irrevocably.<ref name=\"Ware1991pp210-5\" /> However, with local councils and patristic writings, the church applies a selective judgement. Some councils and writers have occasionally fallen into error, and some contradict each other.<ref name=\"Ware1991pp210-5\" />\n\nIn other cases, opinions differ, no consensus is forthcoming, and all are free to choose. With agreement among the Church Fathers, though, the authority of interpretation grows, and full patristic consensus is very strong. With canon law (which tends to be highly rigorous and very strict, especially with clergy) an unalterable validity also does not apply, since canons deal with living on earth, where conditions are always changing and each case is subject to almost infinite variation from the next.<ref name=\"Ware1991pp210-5\" /> Even when and where they were once used with full strictness, their application was not absolute, and was carried out for individuals under the pastoral care of their bishop, who had the authority to decide when individual discipline had been satisfied. This too is a part of the holy tradition.\n\nBy tradition, the Eastern Orthodox Church, when faced with issues that are larger than a single bishop can resolve, holds a local council. The bishops and such others as may attend convene (as St. Paul called the Corinthians to do) to seek the ''mind of the church''.<ref>Holy Bible: {{Bibleverse|1 Cor|1:10|NKJV}}</ref> A council's declarations or edicts then reflect its consensus (if one can be found). An ecumencial council is only called for issues of such import or difficulty or pervasiveness that smaller councils are insufficient to address them. Ecumenical councils' declarations and canons carry binding weight by virtue of their representation across the whole church, by which the mind of the church can be readily seen. However, not all issues are so difficult as to require an ecumenical council to resolve. Some doctrines or decisions, not defined in a formal statement or proclaimed officially, nevertheless are held by the church unshakably and unanimously without internal disturbance, and these, also reflecting the mind of the church, are just as firmly irrevocable as a formal declaration of an ecumenical council. Lack of formality does not imply lack of authority within holy tradition.<ref name=\"Ware1991pp210-5\" /> An example of such unanimity can be found in the acceptance in the 5th century of the lists of books that comprise Holy Scripture, a true canon without official stamp.\n\n===Territorial expansion and doctrinal integrity===\nDuring the course of the early church, there were numerous followers who attached themselves to the Christ and his mission here on Earth, as well as followers who retained the distinct duty of being commissioned with preserving the quality of life and lessons revealed through the experience of Jesus living, dying, resurrecting and ascending among them. As a matter of practical distinction and logistics, people of varying gifts were accorded stations within the community structure\u2014 ranging from the host of agape meals (shared with brotherly and fatherly love), to prophecy and the reading of Scripture, to preaching and interpretations and giving aid to the sick and the poor. Sometime after Pentecost the Church grew to a point where it was no longer possible for the Apostles to minister alone. Overseers (bishops)<ref>Holy Bible: {{Bibleverse|Acts|14:23|NKJV}}</ref> and assistants (deacons and deaconesses)<ref>Holy Bible: {{Bibleverse|Acts|6:1\u20136|NKJV}}</ref> were appointed to further the mission of the Church.\n\nThe church recognised the gathering of these early church communities as being greatest in areas of the known world that were famous for their significance on the world stage\u2014either as hotbeds of intellectual discourse, high volumes of trade, or proximity to the original sacred sites. These locations were targeted by the early apostles, who recognised the need for humanitarian efforts in these large urban centers and sought to bring as many people as possible into the church\u2014such a life was seen as a form of deliverance from the decadent lifestyles promoted throughout the eastern and western Roman empires.\n\nAs the church increased in size through the centuries, the logistic dynamics of operating such large entities shifted: patriarchs, metropolitans, archimandrites, abbots and abbesses, all rose up to cover certain points of administration.<ref>[http://www.ctsfw.edu/etext/walther/deacon.asc Concordia Theological Seminary \u2013 Content Not Found] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403033050/http://www.ctsfw.edu/etext/walther/deacon.asc |date=April 3, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nAs a result of heightened exposure and popularity of the philosophical schools (haereseis) of Greco-Roman society and education, synods and councils were forced to engage such schools that sought to co-opt the language and pretext of the Christian faith in order to gain power and popularity for their own political and cultural expansion. As a result, ecumenical councils were held to attempt to rebuild solidarity by using the strength of distant orthodox witnesses to dampen the intense local effects of particular philosophical schools within a given area.\n\nWhile originally intended to serve as an internal check and balance for the defense of the doctrine developed and spread by the apostles to the various sees against faulty local doctrine, at times the church found its own bishops and emperors falling prey to local conventions. At these crucial moments in the history of the church, it found itself able to rebuild on the basis of the faith as it was kept and maintained by monastic communities, who subsisted without reliance on the community of the state or popular culture and were generally unaffected by the materialism and rhetoric that often dominated and threatened the integrity and stability of the urban churches.\n\nIn this sense, the aim of the councils was not to expand or fuel a popular need for a clearer or relevant picture of the original apostolic teaching. Rather, the theologians spoke to address the issues of external schools of thought who wished to distort the simplicity and neutrality of the apostolic teaching for personal or political gain. The consistency of the Eastern Orthodox faith is entirely dependent on the Holy Tradition of the accepted corpus of belief\u2013the decisions ratified by the fathers of the [[First seven Ecumenical Councils|seven ecumenical councils]], and this is only done at the beginning of a consecutive council so that the effects of the decisions of the prior council can be audited and verified as being both conceptually sound and pragmatically feasible and beneficial for the church as a whole.\n\n==Worship==\n{{Main|Byzantine Rite|Eastern Orthodox worship|Western Rite Orthodoxy}}\n[[File:Meister der Sophien-Kathedrale von Ohrid 001.jpg|thumb|[[Fresco]] of [[Basil the Great]], in the church of [[Church of Saint Sophia, Ohrid|Saint Sophia]], [[Ohrid]].

On certain [[Great Feasts]] (and, according to some traditions, every Sunday) a special [[All-Night Vigil]] (''Agrypnia'') will be celebrated from late at night on the eve of the feast until early the next morning.

The traditional daily cycle of services is as follows:\n* [[Vespers]] \u2013 (Greek ''Hesperinos'') Sundown, the beginning of the liturgical day.\n* [[Compline]] (Greek ''Apodeipnon'', lit. \"After-supper\") \u2013 After the evening meal, and before sleeping.\n* [[Midnight Office]] \u2013 Usually served only in monasteries.\n* [[Matins]] (Greek ''Orthros'') \u2013 First service of the morning. Prescribed to start before sunrise.\n* [[Canonical Hours|Hours]] \u2013 First, Third, Sixth, and Ninth \u2013 Sung either at their appropriate times, or in aggregate at other customary times of convenience. If the latter, The First Hour is sung immediately following Orthros, the Third and Sixth before the Divine Liturgy, and the Ninth before Vespers.\n* [[Divine Liturgy]] \u2013 The [[Eucharist]]ic service. (Called [[Holy Mass]] in the Western Rite)\nThe Divine Liturgy is the celebration of the Eucharist. Although it is usually celebrated between the Sixth and Ninth Hours, it is not considered to be part of the daily cycle of services, as it occurs outside the normal time of the world. The Divine Liturgy is not celebrated on weekdays during [[Great Lent]], and in some places during the lesser fasting seasons either; however, reserve communion is prepared on Sundays and is distributed during the week at the [[Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts]].\n\nOther items brought to the altar during the Divine Liturgy include a gold or silver chalice with red wine, a small metallic urn of warm water, a metallic communion spoon, a little metallic spear, a sponge, a metal disk with cut pieces of bread upon it, and a star, which is a star-shaped piece of metal over which the priest places a cloth covering when transporting the holy gifts to and from the altar. Also found on the altar table is the [[Antimension|antimins]]. The antimins is a silk cloth, signed by the appropriate diocesan bishop, upon which the sanctification of the holy gifts takes place during each Divine Liturgy. The antimins contain the relics of a saint. When a church is consecrated by a bishop, there is a formal service or prayers and sanctification in the name of the saint that the church is named after. The bishop will also often present a small relic of a saint to place in or on the altar as part of the consecration of a new church.\n\nThe book containing liturgically read portions of the four gospels is permanently \"enthroned\" on the altar table. Eastern Orthodox bishops, priests, deacons and readers sing/chant specific verses from this Gospel Book on each different day of the year.\n\nThis daily cycle services is conceived of as both the sanctification of time (''[[chronos]]'', the specific times during which they are celebrated), and entry into eternity (''[[kairos]]''). They consist to a large degree of litanies asking for God's mercy on the living and the dead, readings from the [[Psalms|Psalter]] with introductory prayers, [[troparion|troparia]], and other prayers and hymns surrounding them. The Psalms are so arranged that when all the services are celebrated the entire [[Psalter]] is read through in their course once a week, and twice a week during [[Great Lent]] when the services are celebrated in an extended form.\n\n====Music and chanting====\n[[File:Patriarchate Constantinopolis.jpg|thumb|Chanters singing on the [[kliros]] at the [[Church of St. George, Istanbul|Church of St. George]], [[Patriarchate of Constantinople]]]]\n\nOrthodox services are sung nearly in their entirety. Services consist in part of a dialogue between the clergy and the people (often represented by the choir or the Psaltis [[Cantor (church)|Cantor]]). In each case the prayers are sung or chanted following a prescribed musical form. Almost nothing is read in a normal speaking voice, with the exception of the [[homily]] if one is given.\n\nBecause the human voice is seen as the most perfect instrument of praise, musical instruments ([[organ (music)|organs]], etc.) are not generally used to accompany the choir.\n\nThe church has developed eight modes or tones (see [[Octoechos]]) within which a chant may be set, depending on the time of year, feast day, or other considerations of the [[Typikon]]. There are numerous versions and styles that are traditional and acceptable and these vary a great deal between cultures.{{sfn|Ware|1993|p=238}} It is common, especially in the United States, for a choir to learn many different styles and to mix them, singing one response in Greek, then English, then Russian, etc.\n\nIn the Russian tradition there have been some famous composers of \"unaccompanied\" church music, such as [[Tchaikovsky]] ([[Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom (Tchaikovsky)|Liturgy of St John Chrysostom]], op. 41, 1878, and [[All-Night Vigil (Tchaikovsky)|All-Night Vigil]], op. 52, 1882) and [[Rachmaninoff]] ([[Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom (Rachmaninoff)|Liturgy of St John Chrysostom]], op. 31, 1910, and [[All-Night Vigil (Rachmaninoff)|All-Night Vigil]], op. 37, 1915); and many church tones can likewise be heard influencing their music.\n\n====Incense====\n[[File:\u0415\u0432\u0445\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043a\u0430\u043d\u043e\u043d.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Russian Orthodox [[deacon]] and [[priest]]|alt=]]\nAs part of the legacy handed down from its Judaic roots, [[incense]] is used during all services in the Eastern Orthodox Church as an offering of worship to God as it was done in the Jewish First and Second Temples in Jerusalem (Exodus chapter 30). Incense is also prophesied in the book of {{bibleverse || Malachi|1:11|KJV}} as a \"pure offering\" in the glorification of God by the Gentiles in \"every place\" where the name of God is regarded as \"great\". Traditionally, the base of the incense used is the resin of [[Boswellia sacra]], also known as frankincense, but the resin of fir trees has been used as well. It is usually mixed with various floral essential oils giving it a sweet smell.\n\nIncense represents the sweetness of the prayers of the saints rising up to God ({{bibleverse || Psalm|141:2|KJV}}, {{bibleverse || Revelation|5:8|KJV}}, {{bibleverse-nb || Revelation|8:4|KJV}}). The incense is burned in an ornate golden censer that hangs at the end of three chains representing the Trinity. Two chains represent the human and Godly nature of the Son, one chain for the Father and one chain for the Holy Spirit. The lower cup represents the earth and the upper cup the heaven. In the Greek, Slavic, and Syrian traditions there are 12 bells hung along these chains representing the 12 apostles. There are also 72 links representing 72 evangelists.\n\nThe charcoal represents the sinners. Fire signifies the Holy Spirit and frankincense the good deeds. The incense also represents the grace of the Trinity. The censer is used (swung back and forth) by the priest/deacon to venerate all four sides of the altar, the holy gifts, the clergy, the icons, the congregation, and the church structure itself. Incense is also used in the home where the individual will go around the house and \"cross\" all of the icons saying in Greek: \u1f0d\u03b3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f41 \u0398\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2, \u1f0d\u03b3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f30\u03c3\u03c7\u03c5\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2, \u1f0d\u03b3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f00\u03b8\u03ac\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, \u1f10\u03bb\u03ad\u03b7\u03c3\u03bf\u03bd \u1f21\u03bc\u1fb6\u03c2, or in English: Holy God, Holy Mighty, Holy Immortal, have mercy on us.\n\n===Fasting===\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2018}}\n{{See also|Fasting#Orthodoxy & Eastern Catholicism|l1=Fasting: Orthodoxy & Eastern Catholicism}}\n\n[[File:Cross being thrown at Theophany.jpg|thumb|Blessing of the waters and throwing cross; [[Theophany]]]]\nThe number of fast days varies from year to year, but in general the Eastern Orthodox Christian can expect to spend a little over half the year [[fasting]] at some level of strictness. There are spiritual, symbolic, and even practical reasons for fasting. In the [[Fall of man|Fall from Paradise]] mankind became possessed by a carnal nature; that is to say, became inclined towards the [[Passion (Christianity)|passions]]. Through fasting, Orthodox Christians attempt to return to the relationship of love and obedience to God enjoyed by Adam and Eve in [[Paradise]] in their own lives, by refraining from carnal practices, by bridling the tongue ({{bibleverse || James|3:5\u20136|KJV}}), confession of sins, prayer and almsgiving.\n\nFasting is seen as purification and the regaining of innocence. It is a practice of learning to temper the body's primary desire for food. By learning to temper this basic desire of the body, the practitioner can more readily temper other worldly desires, and thus, become better enabled to draw closer to [[Christian God|God]] in the hope of becoming more [[Deification#In Eastern Christianity|Christ-like]]. Through obedience to the church and its ascetic practices the Eastern Orthodox Christian seeks to rid himself or herself of the ''passions'' (The desires of our fallen carnal nature). All Orthodox Christians are provided with a prescribed set of guidelines. They do not view fasting as a hardship, but rather as a privilege and joy. The teaching of the Church provides both the time and the amount of fasting that is expected as a minimum for every member who chooses to participate. For greater ascesis, some may choose to go without food entirely for a short period of time. A complete three-day fast at the beginning and end of a fasting period is not unusual, and some fast for even longer periods, though this is usually practiced only in monasteries.\n\nIn general, fasting means abstaining from meat and meat products, dairy (eggs and cheese) and dairy products, fish, olive oil, and wine. Wine and oil\u2014and, less frequently, fish\u2014are allowed on certain feast days when they happen to fall on a day of fasting; but animal products and dairy are forbidden on fast days, with the exception of \"Cheese Fare\" week which precedes Great Lent, during which dairy products are allowed. Wine and oil are usually also allowed on Saturdays and Sundays during periods of fast. In some Orthodox traditions, caviar is permitted on [[Lazarus Saturday]], the Saturday before Palm Sunday, although the day is otherwise a fast day. Married couples also abstain from sexual activity on fast days so that they may devote themselves fulsomely to prayer ({{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|7:5|KJV}}).\n\nWhile it may seem that fasting in the manner set forth by the Church is a strict rule, there are circumstances where a person's spiritual guide may allow an [[Economy (Eastern Christianity)|Economy]] because of some physical necessity (e.g. those who are pregnant or infirm, the very young and the elderly, or those who have no control over their diet, such as prisoners or soldiers).\n\nThe time and type of fast is generally uniform for all Orthodox Christians; the times of fasting are part of the [[Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar|ecclesiastical calendar]], and the method of fasting is set by [[canon law]] and holy tradition. There are four major fasting periods during the year: [[Nativity Fast]], [[Great Lent]], [[Apostles' Fast]], and the [[Dormition Fast]]. In addition to these fasting seasons, Orthodox Christians fast on every Wednesday (in commemoration of Christ's betrayal by [[Judas Iscariot]]), and Friday (in commemoration of Christ's [[Crucifixion]]) throughout the year. Monastics often fast on Mondays.\n\nOrthodox Christians who are preparing to receive the Eucharist do not eat or drink at all from vespers (sunset) until after taking [[Holy Communion]]. A similar total fast is expected to be kept on the [[Christmas Eve|Eve of Nativity]], the Eve of [[Epiphany (holiday)|Theophany]] (Epiphany), [[Good Friday|Great Friday]] and [[Holy Saturday]] for those who can do so. There are other individual days observed as fasts (though not as days of total fasting) no matter what day of the week they fall on, such as the [[Beheading of St. John the Baptist]] on 29 August and the [[Feast of the Cross#September 14|Exaltation of the Holy Cross]] on 14 September.\n\n===Almsgiving===\n[[Almsgiving]], more comprehensively described as \"acts of mercy\", refers to any giving of oneself in charity to someone who has a need, such as material resources, work, assistance, counsel, support, or kindness. Along with prayer and fasting, it is considered a pillar of the personal spiritual practices of the Eastern Orthodox Christian tradition. Almsgiving is particularly important during periods of fasting, when the Eastern Orthodox believer is expected to share with those in need the monetary savings from his or her decreased consumption. As with fasting, mentioning to others one's own virtuous deeds tends to reflect a sinful pride, and may also be considered extremely rude.\n\n==Traditions==\n===Monasticism===\n{{Main|Degrees of Orthodox monasticism}}\n[[File:Katharinenkloster Sinai BW 2.jpg|thumb|[[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] (6th century), [[Sinai Peninsula]], [[Egypt]]|220x220px]]\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church places heavy emphasis and awards a high level of prestige to traditions of monasticism and asceticism with roots in [[Early Christianity]] in the [[Near East]] and Byzantine [[Anatolia]]. The most important centres of Christian Orthodox monasticism are [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] in the [[Sinai Peninsula]] ([[Egypt]]) and [[Mount Athos]] in [[Northern Greece]].\n\nAll Orthodox Christians are expected to participate in at least some ascetic works, in response to the [[Law of Christ|commandment of Christ]] to \"come, take up the cross, and follow me.\" ([[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] 10:21 and elsewhere) They are therefore all called to imitate, in one way or another, Christ himself who denied himself to the extent of literally taking up the cross on the way to his voluntary self-sacrifice. However, laypeople are not expected to live in extreme [[asceticism]] since this is close to impossible while undertaking the normal responsibilities of worldly life.\n\nThose who wish to do this therefore separate themselves from the world and live as [[monasticism|monastics]]: monks and nuns. As ascetics ''par excellence'', using the allegorical weapons of prayer and fasting in spiritual warfare against their passions, monastics hold a very special and important place in the Church. This kind of life is often seen as incompatible with any kind of worldly activity including that which is normally regarded as virtuous. Social work, school teaching, and other such work is therefore usually left to laypeople. Ascetics of the Eastern Orthodox Church are recognised by their long hair, and in case of male monks, long beards.\n\n[[File:megaloschema.svg|thumb|Schema worn by monks|alt=|293x293px]]\n\nThere are three main types of monastics. Those who live in monasteries under a common rule are ''coenobitic''. Each monastery may formulate its own rule, and although there are no [[religious order]]s in Orthodoxy some respected monastic centers such as [[Mount Athos]] are highly influential. ''Eremitic'' monks, or [[hermit]]s, are those who live solitary lives. It is the yearning of many who enter the monastic life to eventually become solitary hermits. This most austere life is only granted to the most advanced monastics and only when their superiors feel they are ready for it.\n\nHermits are usually associated with a larger monastery but live in seclusion some distance from the main compound. Their local monastery will see to their physical needs, supplying them with simple foods while disturbing them as little as possible. In between are those in ''semi-eremitic'' communities, or ''sketes'', where one or two monks share each of a group of nearby dwellings under their own rules and only gather together in the central chapel, or ''katholikon'', for liturgical observances.\n\nThe spiritual insight gained from their ascetic struggles make monastics preferred for missionary activity. Bishops are almost always chosen from among monks, and those who are not generally receive the monastic tonsure before their consecrations.\n\nMany (but not all) Orthodox [[seminary|seminaries]] are attached to monasteries, combining academic preparation for [[Holy Orders|ordination]] with participation in the community's life of prayer. Monks who have been ordained to the priesthood are called ''hieromonk'' (priest-monk); monks who have been ordained to the diaconate are called ''hierodeacon'' (deacon-monk). Not all monks live in monasteries, some hieromonks serve as priests in parish churches thus practicing \"monasticism in the world\".\n\nCultural practices differ slightly, but in general ''Father'' is the correct form of address for monks who have been tonsured, while Novices are addressed as ''Brother''. Similarly, ''Mother'' is the correct form of address for nuns who have been tonsured, while Novices are addressed as ''Sister''. Nuns live identical ascetic lives to their male counterparts and are therefore also called ''monachoi'' (monastics) or the feminine plural form in Greek, ''monachai'', and their common living space is called a monastery.\n\n=== Icons and symbols ===\n{{See also|Christian symbolism}}\n[[File:Chrisme Constantinople.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|\"IX\" (Jesus Christ) monogram from a 4th-century [[sarcophagus]] from [[Constantinople]]]]\n[[File:Rom, Calixtus-Katakomben, Steintafel mit Christussymbol \"Chi Rho\".jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|The \"[[Chi-Rho]]\" symbol, [[Catacomb of Callixtus|Catacombs of San Callisto]], [[Rome]]|alt=]]Everything in the Eastern Orthodox Church has a purpose and a meaning revealing God's revelation to man. At the front, or eastern end of the church, is a raised dais with an icon-covered screen or wall ([[iconostasis]] or [[templon]]) separating the nave from the sanctuary. In the center of this wall is the entrance to the altar known as the \"Royal Doors\" through which only the clergy may pass.\n\nThere is a right and left side door on the front of the iconostasis, one depicting the archangel, Michael and the other Gabriel. The priest and altar boys enter and exit through these doors during appropriate parts of the Divine Liturgy. Immediately to the right of the main gate you will always find an icon of Jesus Christ, on the left, an icon of the [[Theotokos]] (Mother of God). Other icons depicted on the iconostasis are Saint John the Forerunner and the Saint after which the church is named.\n\nIn front of the iconostasis is the bishop's chair, a place of honor where a visiting bishop or metropolitan will often sit when visiting the church. An Orthodox priest, when standing at the altar during the Divine Liturgy, faces toward the altar (typically facing east) and properly leads his congregation while together they perform the mystical sacrifice and pray to God.\n\nThe sanctuary contains the Holy Altar, representing the place where Orthodox Christians believe that Christ was born of the virgin Mary, crucified under Pontius Pilate, laid in the tomb, descended into hell, rose from the dead on the third day, ascended into heaven, and will return again at his second coming. A free-standing cross, bearing the body of Christ, may stand behind the altar. On the altar are a cloth covering, a large book containing the gospel readings performed during services, an ark containing presanctified divine gifts (bread and wine) distributed by the deacon or priest to those who cannot come to the church to receive them, and several white beeswax candles.\n\n====Icons====\n{{Main|Icon}}\nThe term 'icon' comes from the Greek word ''eikon'', which simply means image. The Eastern Orthodox believe that the first icons of Christ and [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|the Virgin Mary]] were painted by [[Luke the Evangelist]]. Icons are filled with symbolism designed to convey information about the person or event depicted. For this reason, icons tend to be formulaic, following a prescribed methodology for how a particular person should be depicted, including hair style, body position, clothing, and background details.\n\nIcon painting, in general, is not an opportunity for artistic expression, though each iconographer brings a vision to the piece. It is far more common for an icon to be copied from an older model, though with the recognition of a new saint in the church, a new icon must be created and approved. The personal and creative traditions of [[Catholic Church art|Catholic religious art]] were largely lacking in Orthodox icon painting before the 17th century, when Russian icons began to be strongly influenced by religious paintings and engravings from both Protestant and Catholic Europe. Greek icons also began to take on a strong western influence for a period and the difference between some Orthodox icons and western religious art began to vanish. More recently there has been a trend of returning to the more traditional and symbolic representations.[[File:ConstantinoXI.jpg|thumb|Modern icon depicting [[Constantine XI Palaiologos]], last emperor of the Roman (Byzantine) empire|264x264px]]\n\nAspects of the [[iconography]] borrow from the pre-Christian [[Roman art|Roman]] and [[Hellenistic art]]. [[Henry Chadwick (theologian)|Henry Chadwick]] wrote, \"In this instinct there was a measure of truth. The representations of Christ as the Almighty Lord on his judgment throne owed something to pictures of Zeus. Portraits of the Mother of God were not wholly independent of a pagan past of venerated mother-goddesses. In the popular mind the saints had come to fill a role that had been played by heroes and deities.\"<ref>Henry Chadwick, The Early Church, 283.</ref>\n\nLarge free-standing statues (three-dimensional depictions) are almost non-existent in the Eastern Orthodox Church. This is partly because [[cult image]]s of the Greek gods were a focus of the [[ancient Greek religion]] and its Roman equivalent, and much criticised by Early Christian writers, and partly because icons are meant to show the spiritual nature of man, not the sensual earthly body. [[Relief]]s, however, were used in [[Byzantine art]].\n\nIcons are not considered by the Eastern Orthodox to be idols or objects of worship. The parameters of their usage were clearly spelled out by the [[Second Council of Nicaea|7th ecumenical council]]. Justification for their usage utilises the following logic: before God took human form in Christ, no material depiction was possible and therefore blasphemous even to contemplate. Once God became incarnate, depiction was possible.\n\nAs Christ is believed to be God, it is justified to hold in one's mind the image of God-incarnate. Likewise, when one venerates an icon, it is not the wood or paint that are venerated but rather the individual shown, just as it is not the paper one loves when one might kiss the photograph of a loved one. As [[Saint Basil]] famously proclaimed, honour or veneration of the icon always passes to its archetype. Following this reasoning, the veneration of the glorified human saint made in God's image, is always a veneration of the divine image, and hence God as foundational archetype.\n\nIcons can be found adorning the walls of churches and often cover the inside structure completely.{{sfn|Ware|1993|p=271}} Most Orthodox homes have an area set aside for family prayer, usually an eastern facing wall, where are hung many icons. Icons have been part of Orthodox Christianity since the beginning of the church.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.religionfacts.com/christianity/things/icons.htm |title=Icons \u2013 Orthodox Christianity \u2013 Religion Facts |publisher= |accessdate=5 March 2015 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150322064748/http://www.religionfacts.com/christianity/things/icons.htm |archivedate=March 22, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nIcons are often illuminated by a candle or oil lamp (beeswax for candles and olive oil for lamps are preferred because they are natural and burn cleanly). Besides the practical purpose of making icons visible in an otherwise dark church, both candles and oil lamps symbolise the Light of the World, who is Christ.\n\nTales of miraculous icons are not uncommon, though it has always been considered that the message of such an event was for the immediate faithful involved and therefore does not usually attract crowds. Some miraculous icons whose reputations span long periods of time nevertheless become objects of pilgrimage along with the places where they are kept. As several Orthodox theologians and saints have explored in the past, the icon's miraculous nature is found not in the material, but in the glory of the saint who is depicted. The icon is a window, in the words of [[Pavel Florensky|Paul Florensky]], that actually participates in the glory of what it represents.\n\n====Iconostasis====\n{{Main|Iconostasis}}\n[[File:People's Salvation Cathedral - Days of Consecration 3.jpg|thumb|224x224px|Iconostasis of the [[Romanian People's Salvation Cathedral]]]]\n\nAn ''iconostasis'', also called the ''templon'', is a wall of [[icons]] and religious paintings, separating the [[nave]] from the [[sanctuary]] in a [[church (building)|church]]. ''Iconostasis'' also refers to a portable icon stand that can be placed anywhere within a church. The modern iconostasis evolved from the [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] [[templon]] in the 11th century. The evolution of the iconostasis probably owes a great deal to 14th-century [[Hesychasm|Hesychast]] [[mysticism]] and the wood-carving genius of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].\n\nThe first ceiling-high, five-leveled Russian iconostasis was designed by [[Andrey Rublyov]] in the [[cathedral of the Dormition]] in [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]] in 1408. The separation between sanctuary and nave accomplished by the iconostasis is not mandatory, though it is common practice. Depending on circumstance, the role of the iconostasis can be played by masonry, carved panels, screens, curtains, railings, a cord or rope, plain icons on stands, steps, or nothing at all.\n\n====Cross====\nDepictions of the [[Christian cross|cross]] within the Eastern Orthodox Church are numerous and often highly ornamented, but its use does not extend to all Orthodox traditions.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Some carry special significance.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} The Tri-Bar Cross, popular in Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus, but common throughout the Eastern Orthodox world, seen to the left, has three bars. Its origins are in the early Byzantine Church of the 4th century AD.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\nThe small top crossbar represents the sign that [[Pontius Pilate]] nailed above Christ's head. It often is inscribed with an acronym, \"INRI\", Latin, meaning \"[[INRI|Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews]]\" or \"INBI\", Greek, \"[[INBI|Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews]]\"; however, it is often replaced or amplified by the phrase \"The King of Glory\" in order to answer Pilate's statement with Christ's affirmation, \"My Kingdom is not of this world\".{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\nThere is also a bottom slanting bar which has several explanations. Claims of evidence indicate that there was a small wooden platform for the crucified to stand on in order to support his weight; in Jesus' case his feet were nailed side by side to this platform with one nail each in order to prolong the torture of the cross.\n\nImplied evidence for this comes mainly from two sources, namely, the Bible (in order to cause the victim to die faster, his legs were broken so they could not support his weight and he would suffocate){{citation needed|date=May 2014}} and iconography (all early depictions of the crucifixion show this arrangement, not the later with feet on top with single nail).{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} It has also been pointed out by some experts that the nailed hands of a body crucified in the manner often shown in modern secular art would not support the weight of the body and would tear through. A platform for the feet would relieve this problem.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\nThat the bottom bar is slanted has two explanations, to represent the very real agony which Christ experienced on the cross (a refutation of [[Docetism]]){{citation needed|date=May 2014}} and to signify that the thief on Christ's right chose the right path while the thief on the left did not.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\nOther crosses associated with the Eastern Orthodox Church are the more traditional single-bar crosses, budded designs, the [[Greek cross]], the [[Latin cross]], the [[Jerusalem cross]] (cross patt\u00e9e), [[Celtic cross]]es, and others.<ref>A good explanation of the 3-bar cross was written by Orthodox symbologist Dr Alexander Roman and can be found at http://www.ukrainian-orthodoxy.org/questions/2010/threeBarCross.php</ref> A common symbolism of the slanted foot stool is The foot-rest points up, toward Heaven, on Christ's right hand-side, and downward, to Hades, on Christ's left. \"Between two thieves Thy Cross did prove to be a balance of\nrighteousness: wherefore one of them was dragged down to Hades by the\nweight of his blasphemy ''[the balance points downward],'' whereas the other was lightened of his transgressions unto the comprehension of theology ''[the balance points upward].''

Another popular configuration, especially for churches with large choirs is [[cruciform]] or cross-shaped or what is called the \"Greek-cross.\"\n\nArchitectural patterns vary in shape and complexity, with chapels sometimes added around the main church, or triple altars; but in general, the symbolic layout of the church remains the same. Each church is created with specified qualifications based on what the apostles said in the Bible.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} These qualifications include how big the temple should be.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\n[[File:\u0395\u03c3\u03c9\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u0391\u03b3\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 \u039c\u03b7\u03bd\u03ac 3604 hdr.jpg|thumb|Interior of [[Agios Minas Cathedral]], [[Heraklion]]]]\nThe church building is divided into three main parts: the [[narthex]] ([[Vestibule (Architecture)|vestibule]]), the [[nave]] and the [[sanctuary]] (also called the ''altar'' or ''holy place''). The narthex is where catechumens and non-Orthodox visitors were traditionally asked to stand during services. It is separated from the nave by \"The Royal Gate\". On each side of this gate are candle stands (menalia) representing the pillars of fire that went before the [[Hebrews|Hebrew people]] escaping from Egypt.\n\nThe nave is where most of the congregation stand during services. Traditionally, men stand on the right and women on the left. This is for a number of reasons: (1) Considering the family unit of past centuries the husband was dominant; thus, standing the same distance from the altar, equality is emphasised. (2) The idea of separating the sexes was inherited from the Jewish tradition of doing so within synagogues (3) Separation of sexes also followed the practice of choirs in which different levels of voice are placed in groups to facilitate harmony.\n\nIn general, men and women dress respectfully, typically wearing their \"Sunday best\" to enter the church. Often, women cover their heads as prescribed by Paul (1 Cor. 11:13). Children are considered full members of the church and stand attentively and quietly during services. There is often a choir area at the side or in a loft in back. In addition to the choir, a chanter is always present at the front of the church to chant responses and hymns that are part of the Divine Liturgy offered by the priest. There is usually a dome in the ceiling with an icon of Christ depicted as [[Christ Pantocrator|Ruler of the Universe]] (Pantocrator).\n\nThe [[Archdiocesan Cathedral of the Holy Trinity]] on New York City's [[Upper East Side]] is the largest [[Orthodox Christian]] church in the [[Western Hemisphere]].<ref name=\"google1\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_F5yntZocGIC&pg=PA147&dq=%22holy+trinity%22+cathedral+greek++74#v=onepage&q=%22holy%20trinity%22%20cathedral%20greek%20%2074 |title=The Orthodox Church: Student Edition |author=Thomas E. FitzGerald |publisher= |accessdate=5 January 2013|isbn=978-0-275-96438-2 |year=1998 }}</ref>\n\nApart from the icons, the Eastern Orthodox churches and monasteries are often decorated with [[fresco]]s and [[mosaic]]s.\n\n===Local customs===\n[[File:Broken vases on Holy Saturday in Corfu.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|left|Shards of pottery vases on the street, after being thrown from the windows of nearby houses. A [[Holy Saturday]] tradition in [[Corfu]].]]\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church also has many associated traditions (sometimes referred to simply as customs), compatible with its life and function, but not necessarily tied so closely to the faith itself. These are not generally regarded as a part of Holy Tradition, though no strict dividing line is drawn. As long as compatibility is maintained, general practice often tends to the permissive rather than the restrictive, with the local priest or bishop resolving questions.\n\nMany of these customs are local or cultural, and some are not even especially religious, but form a part of the church's relationship with the people in the time and place where it exists. Where outside customs affect church practices such as worship, a closer watch is kept for guarding the integrity of worship, but suitable local differences are welcomed and celebrated joyfully. The local church customs, especially liturgical ones, are referred to as differences in [[typica]] (Style).\n\nLocality is also expressed in regional terms of churchly jurisdiction, which is often also drawn along national lines. Many Orthodox churches adopt a national title (e.g. [[Orthodox Autocephalous Church of Albania|Albanian Orthodox]], [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church|Bulgarian Orthodox]], [[Antiochian Orthodox Church|Antiochian Orthodox]], [[Georgian Orthodox Church|Georgian Orthodox]], [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]], [[Montenegrin Orthodox Church|Montenegrin Orthodox]], [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodox]], [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]], [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian Orthodox]], [[Ukrainian Orthodox]], etc.) and this title can identify which language is used in services, which bishops preside, and which of the typica is followed by specific [[wikt:congregation|congregations]]. In the Middle East, Orthodox Christians are usually referred to as ''Rum'' (\"Roman\") Orthodox, because of their historical connection with the [[Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire]].{{sfn|Binns|2002|p=3}}\n\nDifferences in ''[[Praxis (Eastern Orthodoxy)|praxis]]'' (\"practice\") tend to be slight, involving things such as the order in which a particular set of hymns are sung or what time a particular service is celebrated. But observances of the saints' days of local saints are more often celebrated in special services within a locality, as are certain national holidays, like Greek Independence Day. In North America, observances of Thanksgiving Day are increasing.\n\nMembers of the church are fully united in faith and the sacred mysteries with all Orthodox congregations, regardless of nationality or location. In general, Orthodox Christians could travel the globe and feel familiar with the services even if they did not know the language being used.\n\nIn the [[Levant]], Christian Orthodox services and identity often combine both the Byzantine Greek and indigenous (Arabic and [[Aramaic]]) traditions. Other Orthodox communities can identify with two Eastern Orthodox churches simultaneously, for example [[Caucasus Greeks]] and [[Pontic Greeks]] in [[Greeks in Russia|Russia]] often identify with both the [[Greek Orthodox Church]] and [[Russian Orthodox Church]], as a result of centuries of assimilation and intermarriage with ethnic Russians and other Christian Orthodox communities in mainly southern [[Russia]].\n\n==Holy mysteries (sacraments)==\nAccording to Orthodox theology, the purpose of the Christian life is to attain ''[[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]]'', the mystical union of mankind with God. This union is understood as both collective and individual. St. [[Athanasius of Alexandria]] wrote concerning the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] that, \"He (Jesus) was made man that we might be made god (\u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03b7\u03b8\u1ff6\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd).\"<ref>Athanasius of Alexandria, ''[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf204.vii.ii.i.html On the Incarnation of the Word]'', [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf204.vii.ii.liv.html \u00a7&nbsp;54].  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417094550/http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf204.vii.ii.liv.html |date=April 17, 2009 }}</ref> See {{bibleverse|2|Peter|1:4|KJV}}, {{bibleverse || John|10:34\u201336|KJV}}, {{bibleverse || Psalm|82:6|KJV}}. The entire life of the church is oriented towards making this possible and facilitating it.\n\nIn the Eastern Orthodox Church the terms \"mystery\" or \"the mysteries\" refer to the process of ''theosis''. While it is understood that God theoretically can do anything instantly and invisibly, it is also understood that he generally chooses to use material substance as a medium in order to reach people. The limitations are those of mankind, not God. Matter is not considered to be evil by the Eastern Orthodox. Water, oil, bread, wine, etc., all are means by which God reaches out to allow people to draw closer to him. How this process works is a \"mystery\" and cannot be defined in human terms. These mysteries are surrounded by prayer and symbolism so that their true meaning will not be forgotten.\n\nThose things which in the West are often termed [[sacraments]] or [[sacramentals]] are known among the Eastern Orthodox as the \"sacred mysteries\". While the Roman Catholic Church numbers seven sacraments, and many Protestant groups list two (baptism and the Eucharist) or even none, the Eastern Orthodox do not limit the number. However, for the sake of convenience, [[catechism]]s will often speak of the seven great mysteries. Among these are [[Holy Communion]] (the most direct connection), [[baptism]], [[Chrismation]], [[Confession (religion)|confession]], [[unction]], [[matrimony]], and [[ordination]]. But the term also properly applies to other sacred actions such as monastic [[tonsure]] or the blessing of [[Holy water in Eastern Christianity|holy water]], and involves fasting, almsgiving, or an act as simple as lighting a candle, burning incense, praying or asking God's blessing on food.{{sfn|Ware|1993|pp=274\u2013277}}\n\n===Baptism===\n[[File:GreekOrthodoxBaptism1.jpg|thumb|right|An Orthodox baptism]]\n\n[[Baptism]] is the mystery which transforms the old and sinful person into a new and pure one; the old life, the sins, any mistakes made are gone and a clean slate is given. Through baptism a person is united to the [[Body of Christ]] by becoming a member of the Orthodox Church. During the service, [[Holy water in Eastern Christianity|water]] is blessed. The catechumen is fully immersed in the water three times in the name of the Trinity. This is considered to be a death of the \"old man\" by participation in the crucifixion and burial of Christ, and a rebirth into new life in Christ by participation in his resurrection.{{sfn|Ware|1993|pp=277\u2013278}} Properly a new name is given, which becomes the person's name.\n\nChildren of Orthodox families are normally baptised shortly after birth. Converts to Orthodoxy are usually formally baptised into the Orthodox Church, though exceptions are sometimes made. Those who have left Orthodoxy and adopted a new religion, if they return to their Orthodox roots, are usually received back into the church through the mystery of Chrismation.\n\nProperly, the mystery of baptism is administered by bishops and priests; however, in emergencies any Orthodox Christian can baptise.{{sfn|Ware|1993|p=278}} In such cases, should the person survive the emergency, it is likely that the person will be properly baptised by a priest at some later date. This is not considered to be a second baptism, nor is it imagined that the person is not already Orthodox, but rather it is a fulfillment of the proper form.\n\nThe service of Baptism used in Orthodox churches has remained largely unchanged for over 1500 years. This fact is witnessed to by St. [[Cyril of Jerusalem]] (d. 386), who, in his ''Discourse on the Sacrament of Baptism'', describes the service in much the same way as is currently in use.\n\n===Chrismation===\n[[Chrismation]] (sometimes called [[confirmation]]) is the mystery by which a baptised person is granted the gift of the [[Holy Spirit]] through anointing with Holy [[Chrism]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oca.org/OCchapter.asp?SID=2&ID=52 |title=The Orthodox Faith |author=Fr. Thomas Hopko |year= 1981|website= |publisher=St. Vladimir's Seminary Press |accessdate=11 November 2013}}</ref>{{sfn|Ware|1993|pp=278\u2013279}} It is normally given immediately after baptism as part of the same service, but is also used to receive lapsed members of the Orthodox Church.{{sfn|Harakas|1987|pp=56\u201357}} As baptism is a person's participation in the death and resurrection of Christ, so Chrismation is a person's participation in the coming of the Holy Spirit at [[Pentecost]].<ref name=\"ware1993p279\">{{harvnb|Ware|1993|p=279}}</ref>\n\nA baptised and chrismated Orthodox Christian is a full member of the church and may receive the Eucharist regardless of age.<ref name=ware1993p279 />\n\nThe creation of Chrism may be accomplished by any bishop at any time, but usually is done only once a year, often when a synod of bishops convenes for its annual meeting. (Some autocephalous churches get their chrism from others.) Anointing with it substitutes for the laying-on of hands described in the New Testament, even when an instrument such as a brush is used.{{sfn|Harakas|1987|p=57}}\n\n===Holy Communion (Eucharist)===\n[[File:Liturgy St James 1.jpg|thumb|Eucharistic elements prepared for the Divine Liturgy|alt=]]The [[Eucharist]] is at the center of Orthodox Christianity. In practice, it is the partaking of the [[Body of Christ|body]] and [[blood of Jesus Christ]] in the midst of the Divine Liturgy with the rest of the church. The bread and wine are believed to become the genuine body and blood of the Christ [[Jesus]] through the operation of the Holy Spirit. The Orthodox Church has never described exactly how this occurs, or gone into the detail that the Catholic Church has in the West.\n\nCommunion is given only to baptised and chrismated Orthodox Christians who have prepared by fasting, prayer and confession. The priest will administer the gifts with a spoon, called a \"cochlear\", directly into the recipient's mouth from the chalice.{{sfn|Ware|1993|p=287}} From baptism young infants and children are carried to the chalice to receive holy communion.<ref name=ware1993p279 />\n\nBecause of the Orthodox understanding of mankind's fallen nature in general those who wish to commune prepare themselves in a way that reflects mankind in paradise. First, they prepare by having their confession heard and the prayer of repentance read over them by a priest. They will increase their prayer rule, adding the prescribed prayers in preparation for communing. Finally, they will fast completely from food and drink from the evening of the previous day (usually sunset on Saturday if communing on Sunday).\n\n===Repentance (Confession)===\n{{Main|Confession (religion)}}\n\nOrthodox Christians who have committed sins but repent of them, and who wish to reconcile themselves to God and renew the purity of their original [[baptism]]s, confess their sins to God before a spiritual guide who offers advice and direction to assist the individual in overcoming their sin. Parish priests commonly function as spiritual guides, but such guides can be any person, male or female (not commonly a layperson but in these cases monks or nuns), who has been given a blessing to hear confessions. Spiritual guides are chosen very carefully as this is a mandate that once chosen must be obeyed. Having confessed, the penitent then has his or her parish priest read the prayer of absolution over them.\n\nSin is not viewed by the Orthodox as a stain on the soul that needs to be wiped out, or a legal transgression that must be set right by a punitive sentence, but rather as a mistake made by the individual with the opportunity for spiritual growth and development. An act of [[penance]] (''epitemia''), if the spiritual guide requires it, is never formulaic, but rather is directed toward the individual and their particular problem, as a means of establishing a deeper understanding of the mistake made, and how to effect its cure. Because full participatory membership is granted to infants, it is not unusual for even small children to confess; though the scope of their culpability is far less than an older child, still their opportunity for spiritual growth remains the same.\n\n===Marriage===\n{{further|Marriage in the Eastern Orthodox Church}}\n[[File:Wedding of Nicholas II and Alexandra Feodorovna by Laurits Tuxen (1895, Hermitage).jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The wedding of Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia]].]]\nFrom the Orthodox perspective, marriage is one of the holy mysteries or sacraments.

For the Orthodox Christian this passage should not be understood to imply that Christian marriage will not remain a reality in the Kingdom, but points to the fact that relations will not be \"fleshy\", but \"spiritual\".<ref name=\"meyendorff 70\" /> Love between wife and husband, as an icon of relationship between Christ and Church, is eternal.<ref name=\"meyendorff 70\">{{cite book| author = John Meyendorff| title = Marriage: An Orthodox Perspective| url = https://books.google.com/?id=YSSCUO1tonkC&pg=PA18| year = 1975| publisher = St. Vladimir's Seminary Press| isbn = 978-0-913836-05-7| page = 18| accessdate = 2016-02-20 }}</ref>\n\nThe church does recognise that there are rare occasions when it is better that couples do separate, but there is no official recognition of civil divorces. For the Orthodox, to say that marriage is indissoluble means that it should not be broken, the violation of such a union, perceived as holy, being an offense resulting from either adultery or the prolonged absence of one of the partners. Thus, permitting remarriage is an act of compassion of the church towards sinful man.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orthodoxresearchinstitute.org/articles/liturgics/athenagoras_remarriage.htm|title=Marriage, Divorce and Remarriage in the Orthodox Church: Economia and Pastoral Guidance|publisher=The Orthodox research Institute|author=Mgr. Athenagoras Peckstadt, Bishop of Sinope|date=18 May 2005|accessdate=19 November 2008}}</ref> Ecclesiastically divorced Orthodox (not civilly divorced only) are usually allowed to remarry in the Orthodox Church, though there is usually imposed on them a fairly severe penance by their bishop and the services for a second marriage in this case are more penitential than joyful. Widows are permitted to remarry without repercussion and their second marriage is considered just as valid as the first. One exception to this rule is the clergy and their wives. Should a married priest die, it is normal that his wife will retire to a monastery once their children are out of the house. Widowed priests are not allowed to remarry (no priest may be married after his ordination) and also frequently end up in monasteries.\n\nThe service of marriage in the Orthodox Church has two distinct parts: the betrothal (engagement) and the crowning. There is no exchange of vows. There is a set expectation of the obligations incumbent on a married couple, and whatever promises they may have privately to each other are their responsibility to keep.\n\n===Holy orders===\n[[File:Orthodox clergy.jpg|thumb|Clergy at All Saints' Antiochian Orthodox Church, Raleigh, United States (L to R): priest, two deacons, bishop.]]\nSince its founding, the church spread to different places and its leaders in each region came to be known as ''episkopoi'' (\"overseers\", plural of ''episkopos'', overseer\u2014Gr. \u1f10\u03c0\u03af\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2), which became \"[[bishop]]\" in English. The other [[Holy orders|ordained]] roles are ''presbyter'' (Gr. {{lang|grc|\u03c0\u03c1\u03b5\u03c3\u03b2\u03cd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2}}, elder), which became \"prester\" and then \"[[priest]]\" in English, and ''diakonos'' (Gr. {{lang|grc|\u03b4\u03b9\u03ac\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2}}, servant), which became \"[[deacon]]\" in English (see also [[subdeacon]]). There are numerous administrative positions among the clergy that carry additional titles.\n\nIn the Greek tradition, bishops who occupy an ancient see are called metropolitans, while the lead bishop in Greece is the archbishop. (In the Russian tradition, however, the usage of the terms \"metropolitan\" and \"archbishop\" is reversed.) Priests can be archpriests, archimandrites or protopresbyters. Deacons can also be archdeacons or protodeacons. The position of deacon is often occupied for life. The deacon also acts as an assistant to a bishop.\n\nWith the exception of bishops, who remain [[Celibacy|celibate]], the Orthodox Church has always allowed priests and deacons to be married, provided the marriage takes place before ordination. In general it is considered preferable for parish priests to be married as they often act as counsel to married couples and thus can draw on their own experience. Unmarried priests are usually monks and live in monasteries, though there are occasions when, because of a lack of married priests, a monk-priest is temporarily assigned to a parish.\n\nWidowed priests and deacons may not remarry and it is common for such members of the clergy to retire to a monastery (see [[clerical celibacy]]). This is also true of widowed wives of clergy, who do not remarry and become nuns when their children are grown. Only men are allowed to receive holy orders, although deaconesses had both liturgical and pastoral functions within the church.<ref name=\"Karras\">{{cite journal\n| doi = 10.1017/S000964070010928X\n| last = Karras\n| first = Valerie A.\n| date=June 2004\n| title = Female Deacons in the Byzantine Church\n| journal = Church History\n| volume = 73\n| issue = 2\n| pages = 272\u2013316\n| issn = 0009-6407\n| quote =\n}}</ref> However, it has fallen out of practice (the last deaconess was ordained in the 19th century).\n\nIn 2017, Patriarch Theodoros II and the Holy Synod of the Patriarchate of Alexandria decided to reinstate the order of deaconesses in the Greek Orthodox Church.

In Greece, during the Ottoman occupation, it became the custom to administer this mystery annually on [[Holy Wednesday|Great Wednesday]] to all believers; in recent decades, this custom has spread to many other locations. It is often distributed on major feast days, or any time the clergy believe it necessary for the spiritual welfare of its congregation.\n\nAccording to Orthodox teaching unction is based on the [[Epistle of James]]:\n\n<blockquote>Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer of faith will save the sick, and the Lord will raise him up.

However, their positions caused theological conflicts within the Church, thus prompting the Emperor Constantine to call for a great ecumenical synod in order to define the Church's position against the growing, often widely diverging, philosophical and theological interpretations of Christianity. He made it possible for this council to meet not only by providing a location, but by offering to pay for the transportation of all the existing bishops of the Church.

All Orthodox agree that the decisions of these further councils are valid; the disagreement is only whether they carry sufficient importance to be considered truly e''cumenical:''\n:8. The [[Fourth Council of Constantinople (Eastern Orthodox)|Fourth Council of Constantinople]] was called in 879. It restored St. [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]] to his See in Constantinople and condemned any alteration of the Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed of 381.\n\n:9. The [[Fifth Council of Constantinople]] was actually a series of councils held between 1341 and 1351. It affirmed the [[Hesychasm|hesychastic]] theology of St. [[Gregory Palamas]] and condemned the philosopher [[Barlaam of Calabria]].\n\nIn addition to these councils there have been a number of other significant councils meant to further define the Orthodox position. They are the Synods of Constantinople, in [[Synod of Constantinople (1484)|1484]], 1583, [[Oros of the Holy Great Church of Christ|1755]], 1819, and 1872, the [[Synod of Jassy]] (Ia\u0219i) in 1642, and the Pan-Orthodox [[Synod of Jerusalem (1672)|Synod of Jerusalem in 1672]].

Numerous [[Autocephaly|autocephalous]] churches were established in Europe: Greece, Georgia, Ukraine, as well as in Russia and Asia.\n\nIn the 530s the [[Hagia Sophia|Church of the Holy Wisdom]] (Hagia Sophia) was built in [[Constantinople]] under Emperor [[Justinian I]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archnet.org/sites/1989 |title=Hagia Sophia |publisher=Archnet |accessdate=12 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Early schisms===\nThere are the \"[[Nestorianism|Nestorian]]\" churches resulted from the reaction of the [[Council of Ephesus]] (431), which are the earliest surviving Eastern Christian churches that keep the faith of only the first two ecumenical councils, i.e., the [[First Council of Nicaea]] (325) and the [[First Council of Constantinople]] (381) as legitimate. \"Nestorian\" is an outsider's term for a tradition that predated the influence of [[Nestorius]], the origin of which might lay in certain sections of the [[School of Antioch]] or via Nestorius' teachers [[Theodore of Mopsuestia]] or [[Diodore of Tarsus]]. The modern incarnation of the \"[[Nestorian Church]]\" is commonly referred to as \"the Assyrian Church\" or fully as the [[Assyrian Church of the East]].\n\nThe church in Egypt ([[Patriarchate of Alexandria]]) split into two groups following the [[Council of Chalcedon]] (451), over a dispute about the relation between the divine and human natures of [[Jesus]]. Eventually this led to each group [[Anathema#Religious usage|anathematizing]] the other. Those that remained in communion with the other patriarchs (by accepting the Council of Chalcedon) are known today as the [[Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria]], where the adjective \"Greek\" refers to their ties to the Greek-speaking culture of the Byzantine Empire. However, those who disagreed with the findings of the Council of Chalcedon were the majority in Egypt, and today they are known as the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]], having maintained a separate patriarchate. The Coptic Orthodox Church is currently the largest Christian church in Egypt and in the whole Middle East. There was also a similar, albeit smaller scale, split in [[Syria]] ([[Patriarchate of Antioch]]), which resulted in the separation of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] from the [[Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch|Byzantine Patriarchate of Antioch]].\n\nThose who disagreed with the Council of Chalcedon are sometimes called \"[[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]]\" to distinguish them from the \"[[Eastern Orthodox]]\", who accepted the Council of Chalcedon. Oriental Orthodox are also sometimes referred to as \"non-Chalcedonians\", or \"anti-Chalcedonians\". The Oriental Orthodox Church denies that it is monophysite and prefers the term \"[[miaphysite]]\", to denote the \"united\" nature of Jesus (two natures united into one) consistent with St. Cyril's theology: \"The term union...signifies the concurrence in one reality of those things which are understood to be united\" and \"the Word who is ineffably united with it in a manner beyond all description\" ([[St. Cyril of Alexandria]], ''On the Unity of Christ''). Both the Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox churches formally believe themselves to be the continuation of the true church, although over the last several decades there has been considerable reconciliation and the prospect of reunification has been discussed.\n\n===Conversion of South and East Slavs===\n{{Further|Christianization of Bulgaria|Christianization of the Rus' Khaganate|Christianization of Kievan Rus'}}\nIn the 9th and 10th centuries, Christianity made great inroads into pagan Europe, including [[Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]] (864) and later [[Kievan Rus']] (988). This work was made possible by the work of the Byzantine-era [[saints Cyril and Methodius]]. When king [[Rastislav of Moravia]] asked Byzantium for teachers who could minister to the Moravians in their own language, [[Michael III|Byzantine emperor Michael III]] chose these two brothers. Cyril and Methodius translated the [[Bible]] and many of the prayer books. With time, as the translations prepared by them were copied by speakers of other dialects, the hybrid literary language [[Church Slavonic]] was created. Originally sent to convert the Slavs of [[Great Moravia]], Cyril and Methodius were forced to compete with [[Frankish mythology|Frankish]] missionaries from the Roman diocese. Their [[Saint Sava (disciple of Saints Cyril and Methodius)|disciples]] were driven out of Great Moravia in AD 886 and emigrated to [[Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]].<ref>A. Avenarius.

There were doctrinal issues like the [[filioque clause]] and the authority of the Roman [[Pope]] involved in the split, but these were greatly exacerbated by political factors of both Church and state, and by cultural and linguistic differences between Latins and Greeks. Regarding [[papal supremacy]], the Eastern half grew disillusioned with the Pope's centralization of power, as well as his blatant attempts of excluding the Eastern half in regard to papal approvals. It used to be that the emperor would at least have say when a new Pope would be elected, but towards the high Middle Ages, the Christians in Rome were slowly consolidating power and removing Byzantine influence. However, even before this exclusionary tendency from the West, well before 1054, the Eastern and Western halves of the Church were in perpetual conflict, particularly during the periods of Eastern [[iconoclasm]] and the [[Photian schism]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orthodox.org.ph/content/view/211/50/|title=East-West Schism 01|publisher=Orthodox Church in the Philippines|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114151752/http://www.orthodox.org.ph/content/view/211/50/ |archive-date=14 January 2012 |url-status = dead|access-date=20 June 2016 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Tintoretto.2tomaconstantinopla.jpg|thumb|Latin Crusaders [[Siege of Constantinople (1204)|sacking the city of Constantinople]], the capital of the Eastern Orthodox controlled [[Byzantine Empire]], in 1204.]]\n\nThe final breach is often considered to have arisen after the capture and sacking of Constantinople by the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1204; the final break with Rome occurred circa 1450.

The Orthodox trace their bishops back to the apostles through [[apostolic succession]], and continue the ancient Christian practices of veneration of saints, especially Mary as the [[Theotokos]], prayers for the dead, and [[monasticism]]. Orthodoxy does not openly promote [[statuary]], although it is not expressly condemned, instead limiting itself primarily to two-dimensional iconography. Western theological concepts of [[original sin]], [[substitutionary atonement]], [[predestination]], [[purgatory]] and [[particular judgment]] are generally rejected by traditional Orthodox theologians.\n\nThe Orthodox believe themselves to be the [[Four Marks of the Church|One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church]], that is, the true Church established by Jesus Christ and placed into the care of the apostles. As almost all other Christian groups are in indirect schism with the Orthodox Church, mostly as a result of the [[East-West schism|Great Schism]] with the [[Catholic Church]] at the turn of the second Christian millennium (before the schisms of the [[Protestant Reformation]]), these other groups are viewed as being Christian, but who, to varying degrees, lack full theological orthodoxy and [[orthopraxy]]. As such, all groups outside of the Orthodox Church are not seen as being members of the church proper, but rather separated brethren who have failed to retain the fullness of the Christian faith and theology. These deviations from orthodoxy have traditionally been called [[heresy]], but due to the term's perceived pejorative connotations, some prefer the more technical designation of the term [[heterodoxy]].\n\nIn 1920, the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, published an encyclical \"addressed 'To all the Churches of Christ, wherever they may be', urging closer co-operation among separated Christians, and suggesting a 'League of Churches', parallel to the newly founded [[League of Nations]]\".<ref name=\"Ware1993\">{{cite book|last=Ware|first=Kallistos|title=The Orthodox Church|accessdate=|date=29 April 1993|publisher=Penguin Adult|language=English |isbn=978-0-14-014656-1|page=322|quote=From the beginning of the twentieth century the Ecumenical Patriarchate has shown a special concern for Christian reconciliation. At his accession in 1902, Patriarch Joachim III sent an encyclical letter to all the autocephalous Orthodox Churches, asking in particular for their opinion on relations with other Christian bodies. In January 1920 the Ecumenical Patriarchate followed this up with a bold and prophetic letter addressed 'To all the Churches of Christ, wherever they may be', urging closer co-operation among separated Christians, and suggesting a 'League of Churches', parallel to the newly founded League of Nations. Many of the ideas in this letter anticipate subsequent developments in the WCC. Constantinople, along with several of the other Orthodox Churches, was represented at the Faith and Order Conferences at Lausanne in 1927 and at Edinburgh in 1937.

Presently, there are two communions that reject each other and, in addition, some schismatic churches not in any communion, with all three groups identifying as Eastern Orthodox.\n[[File:\u03a0\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03af\u03b1_\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5_\u03a5\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf\u03cd_\u0395\u03be\u03c9\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03ce\u03bd_\u039d._\u039a\u03bf\u03c4\u03b6\u03b9\u03ac_\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd_\u0391\u03b3\u03af\u03b1_\u03ba\u03b1\u03b9_\u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7_\u03a3\u03cd\u03bd\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf_\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2_\u039f\u03c1\u03b8\u03cc\u03b4\u03bf\u03be\u03b7\u03c2_\u0395\u03ba\u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03af\u03b1\u03c2,_\u039a\u03c1\u03ae\u03c4\u03b7,_16-27-6-2016_(27614224782).jpg|thumb|The [[Pan-Orthodox Council]], Kolymvari, Crete, Greece, June 2016]]\nThe main traditional historical communion is divided into two groups\u2014those who use the [[Revised Julian calendar]] for calculating fixed feasts and the Julian calendar for calculating movable feasts, and those who use the Julian calendar for all purposes. This second group may include congregations whose church allows them to choose, with the proviso that the choice remains in effect at least until the end of the church year. Also in communion are the Estonian and Finnish Orthodox churches who have a dispensation to use the [[Gregorian calendar]] for all purposes. Another group is referred to as [[True Orthodoxy]] (or [[Old Calendarists]]); they are those who, without authority from their parent churches, have continued to use the old [[Julian calendar]], claiming that the [[Old Calendarists|calendar reform]] in the 1920s is in contravention of the ecumenical councils. Similarly, another group called the [[Old Believers]], separated in 1666 from the official Russian Orthodox Church as a protest against church rite reforms introduced by [[Patriarch Nikon of Moscow]]. As Eastern Orthodox Christianity is both collegial and local in structure, there is no single organization called the \"True Orthodox Church\" nor is there official recognition among the \"True Orthodox\" as to who is properly included among them. While some unions have taken place even up to the present, the majority of True Orthodox are only secondarily concerned with reunion as opposed to preservation of Eastern Orthodox teaching.\n\nThe calendar question reflects the dispute between those who wish to use a calendar which is reformed yet not Gregorian (effectively gaining the perceived benefits of the Gregorian calendar without disregarding the three anathemas issued against it in the sixteenth century), something which opponents consider unnecessary and damaging to continuity, and those who wish to maintain the traditional ecclesiastical calendar (which happens to be based on the Julian calendar), arguing that such a modern change goes against 1900 years of church tradition and was in fact perpetrated without an ecumenical council, which would surely have rejected the idea.\n\nThe dispute has led to much acrimony, and sometimes even to violence. Following canonical precepts, some adherents of the old calendar have chosen to abstain from clerical inter-communion with those synods which have embraced the new calendar until the conflict is resolved. The monastic communities on Mount Athos have provided the strongest opposition to the new calendar, and to [[Modernism in the Catholic Church|modernism]] in general, while still maintaining communion with their mother church.\n\nThe [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia]] (ROCOR) has recently united with the Moscow Patriarchate; these two branches of the Russian Orthodox Church had separated from each other in the 1920s due to the subjection of the latter to the hostile [[Soviet Union|Soviet regime]] (see [[Act of Canonical Communion with the Moscow Patriarchate|Act of Canonical Communion]]).\n\n===Main communion===\n[[File:AlexGreekCathedralFront.jpg|thumb|[[Cathedral of Evangelismos]], [[Alexandria]]]]\nThe Orthodox Church is a [[Full communion|communion]] of 14 [[Autocephaly|autocephalous]] (that is, administratively completely independent) regional churches,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ec-patr.org/dioceses.php?lang=en&id=99|title=Ecumenical Patriarchate|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2015}}</ref> plus the Orthodox Church in America and recently the [[Orthodox Church of Ukraine]].

It is located 13&nbsp;km east of National Highway 3 (Agra-Mumbai highway) and 91&nbsp;km from [[Indore]], the commercial capital of the state. The Town lies on the north bank of the [[Narmada River]].\nIt was the capital of the [[Malwa]] during the [[Maratha]] [[Holkar|Holkar reign]] till 6 January 1818, when the capital was shifted to [[Indore]] by Malhar Rao Holkar III.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word Maheshwar in Hindi means ''Great God, ''an epithet of [[Lord Shiva]].\n\n==History and mythology==\nWriters such as [[Hasmukh Dhirajlal Sankalia|HD Sankalia]],<ref>{{cite book |author=Hasmukhlal Dhirajlal Sankalia |title=Aspects of Indian History and Archaeology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2pwtAAAAMAAJ |year=1977 |publisher=B.

According to a popular legend, one day the King Sahasrarjun and his 500 wives went to the river for a picnic. When the wives wanted a vast play area, the King stopped the mighty river Narmada with his 1000 arms. While they were all enjoying themselves, [[Ravana]] flew by in his Pushpak Vimana. Downstream, when he saw the dry river bed, he thought it was an ideal place to pray to Lord Shiva. He made a Shivalinga out of the sand and began to pray. When Sahasrajuna's wives were done playing and they stepped out of the river bed, he let the waters flow. The voluminous river flowed down sweeping Ravana's Shivalinga along, messing up his prayers. Furious, Ravana tracked Sahasrajuna and challenged him. Armed to the hilt the mighty Ravana was in for a huge surprise. The mighty Sahasrarjuna with the 1000 arms pinned Ravana to the ground. Then he placed 10 lamps on his heads and one on his hand. After tying up Ravana, Sahasrarjuna dragged him home and tied him up to the cradle pole of his son. A humiliated Ravana stayed prisoner until his release was secured. [[Jamadagni]] rishi, [[Renuka]] Devi and Lord [[Parashurama]] with whom Kartavirya Arjuna's story is closely associated also lived nearby.\n\nIn Mahabharata,<ref>[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m02/m02030.htm story of Mahishmati in Mahabharata]</ref> there is a narration of an unusual tradition wherein marriage as a civil institution was not universal in Mahishmati unlike in rest of Aryavarta, which is also narrated in the Telugu-language ''[[Andhra Mahabharatam|Andhra Mahabharata]]'' in \u2018Sabha parva\u2019.\n\nAs per the legend, there was a Nishada king named Nila who ruled over Mahishmati. King Nila had a daughter who was exceedingly beautiful. So much so that [[Agni]] (lord of fire) fell in love with her which was reciprocated. The princess always used to stay near the sacred fire of her father, causing it to blaze up with vigour. And king Nila's sacred fire, even if fanned, would not blaze until agitated by the gentle breath of her lips. Agni, assuming the form of a [[Brahman (cattle)|Brahman]] starts courting with the princess for long. But, one day the couple was discovered by the king, who became furious. Nila thereupon ordered the Brahman to be punished according to law. At this the illustrious deity flamed up in wrath and beholding the terrible flame, the king felt terrified and bent his head low on the ground. King hails Lord Agni and says he cannot punish a god who is responsible for the origin of Vedas, source of all Knowledge and Dharma. Pacified Agni then grants a boon to Nishada, and the King requests for the protection of his kingdom from any invasions. Agni swears to protect his kingdom on the condition that the king should sanctify pleasure out of pure love a legitimate action in his kingdom. Liberated from the orthodoxy of marriage as a prelude, women of Mahishmati enjoyed freedom that was then unheard of elsewhere in Arya-Varta.\n\nYears later, after the epic war the victorious [[Yudhishthira]] plans on conducting a [[Yagna]] by winning over everyone else on Earth. [[Sahadeva]], the youngest of Pandavas knowing that Lord Agni was protecting the Nishada kingdom, prays to Lord Agni successfully and there upon moves to [[Saurashtra people|Saurashtra]] kingdom.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Andhra Mahabharatha|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>{{page needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nOf note, even to this day, the Sahasrarjun temple at Maheshwar lights 11 lamps in honour of Lord Agni blessing the Kingdom. Alternatively, this tradition is attributed to Sahasrarjun queens humiliating captive ten-headed Ravana by lighting up candles on his foreheads.\n\nIn the late eighteenth century, Maheshwar served as the capital of the great [[Maratha]] queen [[Rajmata Ahilya Devi Holkar]]. She embellished the city with many buildings and public works, and it is home to her palace, as well as numerous temples, a [[fort]], and riverfront ''ghats'' (broad stone steps which step down to the river).\n\nJagadguru Kripaluji Maharaj has performed various akhand (continues) sankirtan outside the Shiva temple at Maheshwar for more than months. Even though Kripaluji was from mahu (30&nbsp;km from Maheshwar), he frequently visited this place in his early life with devotees of lord Krishna to perform sankirtan on the banks of the Narmada river in Maheshwar.\n\n[[File:Maheshwar Fort - Exterior 03.jpg|thumb|left|Fort Ahilya of the [[Holkar]] dynasty, in Maheshwar.]]\n[[File:Maheshwar fort.JPG|thumb|right|Ahilya Fort at Maheshwar.]]\n[[File:Narmada river, Maheshwari.jpg|thumb|Narmada river, Maheshwari]]\n[[File:Fort of maheshwar.jpg|thumb|Fort of Maheshwar and Narmada river]]\n\n==Demographics==\n{{As of|2001}} India [[census]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.censusindia.net/results/town.php?stad=A&state5=999|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040616075334/http://www.censusindia.net/results/town.php?stad=A&state5=999|archivedate=2004-06-16|title= Census of India 2001: Data from the 2001 Census, including cities, villages and towns  (Provisional)|accessdate=2008-11-01|publisher= Census Commission of India}}</ref> Maheshwar had a population of 24000.

It is located 13&nbsp;km east of National Highway 3 (Agra-Mumbai highway) and 91&nbsp;km from [[Indore]], the commercial capital of the state. The Town lies on the north bank of the [[Narmada River]].\nIt was the capital of the [[Malwa]] during the [[Maratha]] [[Holkar|Holkar reign]] till 6 January 1818, when the capital was shifted to [[Indore]] by Malhar Rao Holkar III.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word Maheshwar in Hindi means ''Great God, ''an epithet of [[Lord Shiva]].\n\n==History and mythology==\nWriters such as [[Hasmukh Dhirajlal Sankalia|HD Sankalia]],<ref>{{cite book |author=Hasmukhlal Dhirajlal Sankalia |title=Aspects of Indian History and Archaeology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2pwtAAAAMAAJ |year=1977 |publisher=B.

According to a popular legend, one day the King Sahasrarjun and his 500 wives went to the river for a picnic. When the wives wanted a vast play area, the King stopped the mighty river Narmada with his 1000 arms. While they were all enjoying themselves, [[Ravana]] flew by in his Pushpak Vimana. Downstream, when he saw the dry river bed, he thought it was an ideal place to pray to Lord Shiva. He made a Shivalinga out of the sand and began to pray. When Sahasrajuna's wives were done playing and they stepped out of the river bed, he let the waters flow. The voluminous river flowed down sweeping Ravana's Shivalinga along, messing up his prayers. Furious, Ravana tracked Sahasrajuna and challenged him. Armed to the hilt the mighty Ravana was in for a huge surprise. The mighty Sahasrarjuna with the 1000 arms pinned Ravana to the ground. Then he placed 10 lamps on his heads and one on his hand. After tying up Ravana, Sahasrarjuna dragged him home and tied him up to the cradle pole of his son. A humiliated Ravana stayed prisoner until his release was secured. [[Jamadagni]] rishi, [[Renuka]] Devi and Lord [[Parashurama]] with whom Kartavirya Arjuna's story is closely associated also lived nearby.\n\nIn Mahabharata,<ref>[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m02/m02030.htm story of Mahishmati in Mahabharata]</ref> there is a narration of an unusual tradition wherein marriage as a civil institution was not universal in Mahishmati unlike in rest of Aryavarta, which is also narrated in the Telugu-language ''[[Andhra Mahabharatam|Andhra Mahabharata]]'' in \u2018Sabha parva\u2019.\n\nAs per the legend, there was a Nishada king named Nila who ruled over Mahishmati. King Nila had a daughter who was exceedingly beautiful. So much so that [[Agni]] (lord of fire) fell in love with her which was reciprocated. The princess always used to stay near the sacred fire of her father, causing it to blaze up with vigour. And king Nila's sacred fire, even if fanned, would not blaze until agitated by the gentle breath of her lips. Agni, assuming the form of a [[Brahman (cattle)|Brahman]] starts courting with the princess for long. But, one day the couple was discovered by the king, who became furious. Nila thereupon ordered the Brahman to be punished according to law. At this the illustrious deity flamed up in wrath and beholding the terrible flame, the king felt terrified and bent his head low on the ground. King hails Lord Agni and says he cannot punish a god who is responsible for the origin of Vedas, source of all Knowledge and Dharma. Pacified Agni then grants a boon to Nishada, and the King requests for the protection of his kingdom from any invasions. Agni swears to protect his kingdom on the condition that the king should sanctify pleasure out of pure love a legitimate action in his kingdom. Liberated from the orthodoxy of marriage as a prelude, women of Mahishmati enjoyed freedom that was then unheard of elsewhere in Arya-Varta.\n\nYears later, after the epic war the victorious [[Yudhishthira]] plans on conducting a [[Yagna]] by winning over everyone else on Earth. [[Sahadeva]], the youngest of Pandavas knowing that Lord Agni was protecting the Nishada kingdom, prays to Lord Agni successfully and there upon moves to [[Saurashtra people|Saurashtra]] kingdom.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Andhra Mahabharatha|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>{{page needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nOf note, even to this day, the Sahasrarjun temple at Maheshwar lights 11 lamps in honour of Lord Agni blessing the Kingdom. Alternatively, this tradition is attributed to Sahasrarjun queens humiliating captive ten-headed Ravana by lighting up candles on his foreheads.\n\nIn the late eighteenth century, Maheshwar served as the capital of the great [[Maratha]] queen [[Rajmata Ahilya Devi Holkar]]. She embellished the city with many buildings and public works, and it is home to her palace, as well as numerous temples, a [[fort]], and riverfront ''ghats'' (broad stone steps which step down to the river).\n\nJagadguru Kripaluji Maharaj has performed various akhand (continues) sankirtan outside the Shiva temple at Maheshwar for more than months. Even though Kripaluji was from mahu (30&nbsp;km from Maheshwar), he frequently visited this place in his early life with devotees of lord Krishna to perform sankirtan on the banks of the Narmada river in Maheshwar.\n\n[[File:Maheshwar Fort - Exterior 03.jpg|thumb|left|Fort Ahilya of the [[Holkar]] dynasty, in Maheshwar.]]\n[[File:Maheshwar fort.JPG|thumb|right|Ahilya Fort at Maheshwar.]]\n[[File:Narmada river, Maheshwari.jpg|thumb|Narmada river, Maheshwari]]\n[[File:Fort of maheshwar.jpg|thumb|Fort of Maheshwar and Narmada river]]\n\n==Demographics==\n{{As of|2001}} India [[census]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.censusindia.net/results/town.php?stad=A&state5=999|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040616075334/http://www.censusindia.net/results/town.php?stad=A&state5=999|archivedate=2004-06-16|title= Census of India 2001: Data from the 2001 Census, including cities, villages and towns  (Provisional)|accessdate=2008-11-01|publisher= Census Commission of India}}</ref> Maheshwar had a population of 24000.

The town lies on the [[Cairo \u2013 Cape Town Highway|Trans-African Highway 4 Cairo-Cape Town]], about {{convert|150|mi|km}} from the capital of [[Addis Ababa]]. It has a latitude of 7\u00b0 12' north and a longitude of 38\u00b0 36' east.\n  \nThe 2007 national census reported a total population for this town of 100,454, of whom 50,654 were men and 49,800 were women. A plurality of the inhabitants practiced [[Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity]], with 43.44% of the population reporting they observed this belief, while 31.15% of the population said they were [[Islam in Ethiopia|Muslim]], 23.53% of the population were [[P'ent'ay|Protestant]], and 1.3% were [[Roman Catholicism in Ethiopia|Catholic]]<ref>[http://www.csa.gov.et/index.php?option=com_rubberdoc&view=doc&id=272&format=raw&Itemid=521 ''2007 Population and Housing Census of Ethiopia: Results for Oromia Region'', Vol. 1], Tables 2.1, 2.5, 3.4 (accessed 13 January 2012)</ref>.\n\nThe 1994 national census reported the town had a total population of 52,080, 25,426 of whom were males and 26,654 were females.\n\nThe resort of [[Wondo Genet]] lies near Shashamane, as does the [[Senkele Wildlife Sanctuary]].\n\n== Education ==\n* [[Africa Beza College]]\n\n== History ==\nIn April 1941 the Italian troops retreating from Harar, Somalia and Shoa, concentrated in Shashamane after suffering several attacks by the British Army, R.A.F. and Ethiopian ''Roomaa''. The British troops arrived at the beginning of May and the line of the Italian defense was held by Infantry and Artillery battalions on Little Dadaba river. On May 10 {{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} started an intensive shelling between South African and Indian artilleries on one side (supported by Hurricane planes) and the Italian artillery, on the other. After two days of reciprocal bombardment, on May 13 the British attacked with [[Natal Mounted Rifles]], [[King's African Rifles]], anti-tank rifles, mortars, tanks and armoured cars. Since Lieut. Col. Noel Douglas McMillan became ill, the attack was led by Major Leonard Montague Harris. The Italian 12th Colonial Somali Battalion (commanded by Major Gioacchino Nadalini), reinforced by Black Shirts, and the 121.st Artillery Battalion (commanded by Lieut. Col. Nicol\u00f2 Bonessa), reinforced by tankettes, an A.A. battery, machine gunners and infantrymen, were overwhelmed. Most of the Italian officers died on the battlefield, as well as both cited commanders.\n\n\n==The Promised Land==\n[[File:Twelve Tribes of Israel headquarters.jpg|upright|thumb|Twelve Tribes of Israel headquarters in Shashamane]]\nIn the 1950s Emperor [[Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia|Haile Selassie I]] donated approximately {{convert|500|acre|km2}} of African soil {{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} to African Americans who were victims of racism and injustice after being exiled and forced into slavery in The United States of America.  Haile Sellassie I formed the First E.W.F. in Harlem, NY and prepared a series of events to bond with African Americans for the Ethiopian culture before breaking the news about The Land Grants. While one of the female members of the  [[Ethiopian World Federation]] was visiting Jamaica she was very excited and couldn\u2019t keep the news to herself. She shared the information about the Land Grant with the natives of Jamaica. The Land Grants were specifically intended for [https://www.academia.edu/4882204/The_Ethiopian_World_Federation._A_Pan-African_Organisation_among_the_Rastafari_in_Jamaica African American descendants] of slaves in the U.S. in return for the favor that America played in coming to The Royal Families  rescue in a time of need. Once everyone found out about the possibility of returning to the Homeland not only Jamaicans tried their hardest to get over there, divisions of the E.W.F. started popping up all over the World to take advantage of the Land Grants His Majesty left for African Americans.<ref>[http://tadias.wordpress.com/2007/02/07/ethiopian-african-american-relationsthe-case-of-melaku-e-bayen-and-john-robinson/ by Ayele Bekerie, Tadias Magazine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416145452/http://tadias.wordpress.com/2007/02/07/ethiopian-african-american-relationsthe-case-of-melaku-e-bayen-and-john-robinson/ |date=2009-04-16 }}</ref> The official letter confirming the \"Land Grant\" of 1948 was submitted to the members and executives of the Ethiopian World Federation in New York City, 1955.\n\nThe first West Indian family and Federation members were Mr. James Piper and his wife Helen who arrived that same year as the first Land Grant administrators, returning to make a permanent settlement in 1955 on behalf of the federation. Haile Sellassie I visited Jamaica one time in an effort to get the natives to focus on uplifting their communities before visiting Ethiopia. By the time he left the entire community was infatuated with the thought that His Imperial Majesty was Jesus Christ in the flesh. He never returned. He did however try his best to encourage them to take care of the land that they had already been given in their own country. His Majesty left specific instructions with the U.S. and Africa pertaining to the Land Grant. African Americans were extremely traumatized as they fought for Civil Rights in America. They had a very hard time trying to stabilize their families, their citizenship, their equal rights all while figuring out their nationality while America was repairing itself for desegregation. They were promised that the land would be there when they were tired of fighting for Civil Rights and equality in The United States.  Shashemane is their Promised Land.

His Imperial Majesty was a kind Ruler, He set aside a small area for a couple of settlers to rest their heads.

A few weeks later, the ''Jamaican Daily Gleaner'' reported that E.W.F. members in Jamaica left for Ethiopia on September 5 to develop the settlement with no money or support from their original country. A lot of the settlers there that are not African American do not even have passports or identification yet they are still asking for citizenship.

It has a latitude of 7\u00b0 12' north and a longitude of 38\u00b0 36' east.\n  \nThe 2007 national census reported a total population for this town of 100,454, of whom 50,654 were men and 49,800 were women. A plurality of the inhabitants practiced [[Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity]], with 43.44% of the population reporting they observed this belief, while 31.15% of the population said they were [[Islam in Ethiopia|Muslim]], 23.53% of the population were [[P'ent'ay|Protestant]], and 1.3% were [[Roman Catholicism in Ethiopia|Catholic]]<ref>[http://www.csa.gov.et/index.php?option=com_rubberdoc&view=doc&id=272&format=raw&Itemid=521 ''2007 Population and Housing Census of Ethiopia: Results for Oromia Region'', Vol. 1], Tables 2.1, 2.5, 3.4 (accessed 13 January 2012)</ref>.\n\nThe 1994 national census reported the town had a total population of 52,080, 25,426 of whom were males and 26,654 were females.\n\nThe resort of [[Wondo Genet]] lies near Shashamane, as does the [[Senkele Wildlife Sanctuary]].\n\n== Education ==\n* [[Africa Beza College]]\n\n== History ==\nIn April 1941 the Italian troops retreating from Harar, Somalia and Shoa, concentrated in Shashamane after suffering several attacks by the British Army, R.A.F. and Ethiopian ''Roomaa''. The British troops arrived at the beginning of May and the line of the Italian defense was held by Infantry and Artillery battalions on Little Dadaba river. On May 10 {{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} started an intensive shelling between South African and Indian artilleries on one side (supported by Hurricane planes) and the Italian artillery, on the other. After two days of reciprocal bombardment, on May 13 the British attacked with [[Natal Mounted Rifles]], [[King's African Rifles]], anti-tank rifles, mortars, tanks and armoured cars. Since Lieut. Col. Noel Douglas McMillan became ill, the attack was led by Major Leonard Montague Harris. The Italian 12th Colonial Somali Battalion (commanded by Major Gioacchino Nadalini), reinforced by Black Shirts, and the 121.st Artillery Battalion (commanded by Lieut. Col. Nicol\u00f2 Bonessa), reinforced by tankettes, an A.A. battery, machine gunners and infantrymen, were overwhelmed. Most of the Italian officers died on the battlefield, as well as both cited commanders.\n\n\n==The Promised Land==\n[[File:Twelve Tribes of Israel headquarters.jpg|upright|thumb|Twelve Tribes of Israel headquarters in Shashamane]]\nIn the 1950s Emperor [[Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia|Haile Selassie I]] donated approximately {{convert|500|acre|km2}} of African soil {{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} to African Americans who were victims of racism and injustice after being exiled and forced into slavery in The United States of America.  Haile Sellassie I formed the First E.W.F. in Harlem, NY and prepared a series of events to bond with African Americans for the Ethiopian culture before breaking the news about The Land Grants. While one of the female members of the  [[Ethiopian World Federation]] was visiting Jamaica she was very excited and couldn\u2019t keep the news to herself. She shared the information about the Land Grant with the natives of Jamaica. The Land Grants were specifically intended for [https://www.academia.edu/4882204/The_Ethiopian_World_Federation._A_Pan-African_Organisation_among_the_Rastafari_in_Jamaica African American descendants] of slaves in the U.S. in return for the favor that America played in coming to The Royal Families  rescue in a time of need. Once everyone found out about the possibility of returning to the Homeland not only Jamaicans tried their hardest to get over there, divisions of the E.W.F. started popping up all over the World to take advantage of the Land Grants His Majesty left for African Americans.<ref>[http://tadias.wordpress.com/2007/02/07/ethiopian-african-american-relationsthe-case-of-melaku-e-bayen-and-john-robinson/ by Ayele Bekerie, Tadias Magazine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416145452/http://tadias.wordpress.com/2007/02/07/ethiopian-african-american-relationsthe-case-of-melaku-e-bayen-and-john-robinson/ |date=2009-04-16 }}</ref> The official letter confirming the \"Land Grant\" of 1948 was submitted to the members and executives of the Ethiopian World Federation in New York City, 1955.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=UVmt2VNyT7UC&pg=PA138&lpg=PA138&dq=selassie+visit+1954+ethiopian+world+federation&source=web&ots=noBp52uW0r&sig=hi8tpPeCdXKh3TrD8JS9s0HVRhI&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=4&ct=result by Ras Nathaniel]</ref> The first West Indian family and Federation members were Mr. James Piper and his wife Helen who arrived that same year as the first Land Grant administrators, returning to make a permanent settlement in 1955 on behalf of the federation. Haile Sellassie I visited Jamaica one time in an effort to get the natives to focus on uplifting their communities before visiting Ethiopia. By the time he left the entire community was infatuated with the thought that His Imperial Majesty was Jesus Christ in the flesh. He never returned. He did however try his best to encourage them to take care of the land that they had already been given in their own country. His Majesty left specific instructions with the U.S. and Africa pertaining to the Land Grant. African Americans were extremely traumatized as they fought for Civil Rights in America. They had a very hard time trying to stabilize their families, their citizenship, their equal rights all while figuring out their nationality while America was repairing itself for desegregation. They were promised that the land would be there when they were tired of fighting for Civil Rights and equality in The United States.  Shashemane is their Promised Land.

A major figure in the development of post-Independence New York City and State, Varick became the [[List of mayors of New York City|45th Mayor of New York City]] in 1789 and served eleven concurrent one-year terms until 1801.<ref name=\"dlib\">{{cite web|title=Guide to the Papers of Richard Varick 1743-1871 (Bulk 1775-1830)  MS 655|url=http://dlib.nyu.edu/findingaids/html/nyhs/varick/|website=dlib.nyu.edu|publisher=[[New-York Historical Society]]|accessdate=21 June 2017}}</ref> \n\nPrevious to his terms as mayor, Varick served as the [[Recorder of New York City|14th Recorder of New York City]] from 1784 to 1789. An office that no longer exists, it is equatable to 'Chief Legal Officer'. Along with [[Samuel Jones (New York comptroller)|Samuel Jones]], Varick codified New York State's first statutes after Revolution in the [[Laws of New York]] (2 vols., 1789).

Varick's body of work from this era would lead to the ''Varick Transcripts'' which now live in the [[Library of Congress]].

Amongst Varick's ancestors are [[Joris Jansen Rapelje]], a member of the [[Council of Twelve Men]] which was the first democratic body in the history of the United States (1641). Varick's maternal grandfather was a colonel in the Continental Army whose house, the [[Dey Mansion]], which would go on to play a pivotal role in the American Revolution.\n\nVarick was one of seven children, his siblings being: Abraham Varick (the great-grandfather of Anna Maria Romeyn Varick, who married [[George Lauder (Scottish industrialist)|George Lauder]] of the [[Lauder Greenway Family]].); Dr. John Varick Jr.; Anne Elting; Sarah Froeligh; Jane De Witt (wife of [[Simeon De Witt]]); and Maria Gilbert.\n\n===Education===\nLittle is known about the specifics of Varick's education before university, though surviving letters indicate that he was educated by private tutors and studied Latin, French, and other subjects. He enrolled in King's College (the original name of [[Columbia University]]) in [[New York City]] in 1771 where he studied under [[John Morin Scott]]. Varick clerked for Scott during his education and after being admitted into the New York Bar in October 1774, Scott made him an offer to be a partner in his firm. Unusually, Varick had not yet graduated from King's College despite having passed the bar and never formally graduated. Later in his career, Varick would become a trustee of King's College for over thirty years.<ref name=\"Lefkowitz2003\">{{cite book|last=Lefkowitz|first=Arthur|title=George Washington's Indispensable Men|date=2003|publisher=Stackpole Books|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OHhyDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA219&lpg=PA219&dq=%22george+washington%22+%22richard+varick%22+trusted&source=bl&ots=tGR1fKUCQX&sig=ACfU3U2VhSeS7RTNhnLUqmjqSUy4gc1C8A&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj3vtLDuvrkAhUYFjQIHUIzBtM4ChDoATAEegQICBAB#v=onepage&q=%22george%20washington%22%20%22richard%20varick%22%20trusted&f=false|accessdate=1 October 2019|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Military career==\n===American Revolutionary War===\n====Service under General Schuyler & Northern Army====\n[[File:Richard varick officer continental army.png|thumb|left|Richard Varick painted c.1787 by [[Ralph Earl]]. The portrait shows Varick in his Continental Army officers uniform although he retired his commission in 1783. The blue decoration is that of the Society of the Cincinnati.]] Eight months into his career in private practice, the [[American Revolutionary War]] began. At the influence of his employer, John Morin Scott, Varick suspended his studies and enlisted in the militia. On June 28, 1775, he was appointed captain of the [[1st New York Regiment]] and after only three days as field officer, was appointed military secretary under General [[Philip Schuyler]]. It was thought that Scott, understanding the administrative and intellectual value of his young partner, secured the appointment. Varick departed New York City with Schuyler on July 4, 1775, to head north to [[Fort Ticonderoga]] and launch the campaign to drive the British out of Canada. En route, the traveling party stopped in Albany briefly where Varick would first meet General [[Benedict Arnold]], who would become a good friend, also played a significant role in Varick's life until Arnold's treason in 1780.\n\nBy the summer of 1776, Schuyler had been felled by multiple illnesses and was reeling from a series of losses on the battlefield. Varick, by this juncture, in part out of necessity, and in part by appointment, was performing three jobs at once: private secretary to Schuyler, quartermaster for all the northern forts held by the Continental Army, and the Northern Army's deputy muster master general. Laterally, actual battlefield commands had been outsourced to Arnold and General [[Horatio Gates]]. Schuyler, recognizing the burden Varick was carrying, promoted him to Lieutenant Colonel. Varick's almost total control of the administration for the Northern Army lead to an even closer friendship between Arnold and Varick.\n\nThat same summer, Arnold was planning his attack effort to stop the British advance down [[Lake Champlain]] in what would be one of the first battles in the history of the [[U.S. Navy]]. With a dearth of available ships, the armada was largely built from scratch by Varick who solved the crisis by contacting his wide network in New York City and the surrounding area to send materials and coastal men who were qualified for such work. While the [[Battle of Valcour Island]] ended in defeat for the navy, it succeeded in slowing the British advance for the winter as they retreaded to their Canadian bases.\n\nVarick also faced run-ins with fellow officers who were not part of Schuyler's faction. General [[Anthony Walton White]], who had briefly served at Washington's aide-de-camp, was accused by Schuyler of looting a private home on the frontier. After denying the charges, White barged into Varick's offices and challenged him to a duel, under the impression that Varick had spoken negatively to his character. Varick, unarmed, narrowly escaped White's attempt to murder him after Varick declined the challenge. \n \nAfter the disastrous [[Battle of Saratoga]], Schuyler was removed from duty by the [[Continental Congress]] in August 1777 and replaced by General Gates. With factionalism rife within the Northern Army, Varick was aligned with Arnold which pitted him against Gates, whom he disliked regardless. Their circle of friendship had also grown to include [[Henry Brockholst Livingston]] and [[Matthew Clarkson]]. Their camaraderie was rudely defined as \"the New York gang\" by [[James Wilkinson]], a partisan of General Gates'.\n\nVarick would quietly and capably continue in his role as the Northern Army's deputy muster master general, though not as Gates' aide-de-camp or private secretary, until January 12, 1780 when the department was abolished by the Continental Congress in a larger reorganization.\n\n====Service under General Arnold====\n[[File:Benedict Arnold. Copy of engraving by H. B. Hall after John Trumbull, published 1879., 1931 - 1932 - NARA - 532921.tif|thumb|Benedict Arnold]]\nVarick briefly resumed his law in private practice, which proved challenging in his politically volatile hometown of New York City\u2014which was under occupation by the enemy. In August 1780, Benedict Arnold approached Varick about joining his staff at his newly appointed position as commanding officer of [[West Point, New York|West Point]] (then an active military instillation) as his [[aide-de-camp]] and inspector-general.<ref name=\"Cushman2010\"/><ref name=\"Jameson1900\">{{cite book|last1=Jameson|first1=J.

Varick, along with [[David Franks (aide-de-camp)|David Franks]], were arrested. Varick had been ill in bed when informed both of Arnold's treason and his own arrest. Contemporary reports described Varick as spending several days on the edge of madness about Arnold's defection. Despite Arnold writing to Washington personally to say that his aides were not complicit, both Varick and Franks were detained by Washington as a precautionary measure. After a court of inquiry completed its investigation, they found Varick not guilty, and delivered the following:\n\n<blockquote>\u201c''That Lieutenant Colonel Varick\u2019s conduct with respect to the base Peculations and Treasonable Practices of the late General Arnold is not only unimpeachable but think him entitled (throughout every part of his conduct) to a degree of Merit that does him great honor as an Officer and particularly distinguishes him as a sincere Friend to his Country\u2026''\u201d</blockquote>\n\n====Service under General Washington====\nA by-product of the above was the introduction of Varick to [[George Washington]], which would lead to the two working together for the rest of their careers, and lives. This relationship began in 1781 when Washington petitioned the Continental Congress to establish team of writers to record and preserve all of his, and the army's, papers, planning, and correspondence for use by future generations. This would be under the supervision \u201cof a Man of character in whom entire confidence can be placed\u201d. Washington appointed Varick in this role, which made use of his highly respected administrative skills, and would fully rehabilitate his name after the Arnold scandal. Establishing his office at [[Poughkeepsie]], Varick and his assistants spent more than two years in compiling the forty-four folio volumes known as the [[Varick Transcripts]]. Varick served under Washington solely until Washington retired his commission in 1783.<ref name=\"albanyinstitute\">{{cite web|title=Colonel Richard Varick (1753-1831)|url=http://www.albanyinstitute.org/details/items/colonel-richard-varick-1753-1831.html|website=www.albanyinstitute.org|publisher=[[Albany Institute of History and Art]]|accessdate=21 June 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"metmuseum\">{{cite web|title=Relates to General Richard Montgomery {{!}} Letter from Richard Varick to DeWitt Clinton, Governor of New York, requesting repayment of cash he has advanced for expenditures relating to the Internment<!--sic--> of the Remains of the late General Montgomery {{!}} The Met|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/667757|website=metmuseum.org|publisher=[[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|accessdate=21 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nUpon completing the assigned duties after years or work, General Washington wrote:\n<blockquote>\u201c''I take this first opportunity of signifying my entire approbation of the manner in which you have executed the important duties of recording secretary; and the satisfaction I feel in having my papers so properly arranged, and so correctly recorded; and beg you will accept my thanks for the care and attention which you have given to this business and beg you be persuaded, that I shall take pleasure in asserting on every occasion, the sense of entertainment of the fidelity, skill and indefatigable industry manifested by you in the performance of your public duties''.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Writings of Washington|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/cu31924092900400/cu31924092900400_djvu.txt|website=www.archive.org|pages=113\u2013114|publisher=New York Free Press|accessdate=16 October 2019}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAfter he retired from his service in the Continental Army, Varick would remain in service as a colonel in the [[New York State Militia]] until 1801.<ref name=\"Cushman2010\"/>\n\n=====<div style=\"text-align: center;\">The Varick Transcripts</div>=====\nThe Varick Transcripts are deposited in the [[Library of Congress]].

The resulting 44 letterbooks contain copies of all documents dating from May, 1775 to June, 1785. Categories of papers, records, and correspondence are organized as follows;\n{{ordered list |list_style_type=upper-alpha\n|''Continental Congress''\n|''Continental and State Military Personnel''\n|''Civil Officials and Private Citizens''\n|''Foreign Officers and Subjects of Foreign Nations''\n|''Enemy Officers and British Subjects''\n|''Continental Army Council Proceedings (War Council Proceedings)''\n|''General Orders''\n|''Personal Correspondence''\n}}\n\n===Society of the Cincinnati===\n{{Main|Society of the Cincinnati}}\n{{see also|List of original members of the Society of the Cincinnati}}\nIn 1783 the [[Society of the Cincinnati]] was founded of which Varick was an original member and president of the New York chapter from 1783 until his death in 1831. Membership was generally limited to [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]] who had served at least three years in the [[Continental Army]] or [[Continental Navy|Navy]]. The first meeting of the Society was held in May at a dinner at [[Mount Gulian]] (Verplanck House) in [[Fishkill, New York]], before the British [[Evacuation Day (New York)|evacuation from New York City]]. The meeting was chaired by Varick's friend [[Lieutenant Colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Alexander Hamilton]]. The Society has three goals: \"To preserve the rights so dearly won; to promote the continuing union of the states; and to assist members in need, their widows, and their orphans.\" \n\nVarick would also be responsible for maintaining the legacy of George Washington. From 1790 to 1836, celebrations of Washington's birthday in the City included Tammany Hall dinners, Washington Benevolent Society parades, and an intimate open house held each February 22 by [[Mary Simpson (house servant)|Mary Simpson]] (c. 1752 - March 18, 1836), at her John Street grocery.\n\n==Political career==\n===Pre-Mayor===\nVarick was the [[Recorder of New York City]] from 1784 to 1789. An office that no longer exists, it is equatable to 'Chief Legal Officer'. In this office, along with [[Samuel Jones (New York comptroller)|Samuel Jones]], he codified New York State's first statutes after Revolution in the [[Laws of New York]] (2 vols., 1789). This body of work laid the whole foundation for the [[Law of New York]], the [[New York City Administrative Code]], and the [[Rules of New York City]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/history/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/varick-richard|title=Richard Varick|author=<!--Not stated-->|website=www.encyclopedia.com|publisher=|access-date=October 16, 2019}}</ref>\n\nConcurrently to the above, he was a member of the [[New York State Assembly]] from [[Manhattan|New York County]] from 1786 to 1788. During his term as a member of the New York State Assembly, he was [[Speaker of the New York State Assembly|Speaker]] during the sessions of 1787 and 1788. Varick was appointed the [[New York State Attorney General]] from 1788 to 1789.\n\nRemarkably, due to the elitist nature of the [[New York Constitution|New York State Constitution of 1777]], almost all government positions in the city and state of New York were appointed by the [[Council of Appointment]]. Few, if any, general elections or other democratic functions would exist until 1802. Thus, in the year 1788, Varick was simultaneously the Recorder of New York City, a State Assemblyman representing New York City, the Speaker of the House of the State of New York, and the Attorney General of the State of New York. Though Varick is on record protesting the egregious nature of his occupying multiple offices, it was rationalized at the time that as both an expert administrator and lawyer, he was an ideal choice to fill these myriad offices and to build swiftly the various mechanisms of government. And, that the subsequent laws were codified quickly in the nascent days of an independent New York City and State to ensure the function, and growth, of both entities.\n\n===Mayor of New York City===\n[[File:Richard varick 1805 john trumbull.png|thumb|left|Richard Varick (c.1805) by [[John Trumbull]] which still hangs today in [[New York City Hall]]]]\n[[File:Richard Varick Signature 1796.jpg|thumb|right|Signature of Richard Varick while Mayor of New York (1798)]]\nMost notably, Varick was the [[Mayor of New York City]] for twelve years during the formative post-Independence era from 1789 to 1801.<ref name=\"Marcus1985\">{{cite book|last1=Marcus|first1=Maeva|last2=Perry|first2=James R.|title=The Documentary History of the Supreme Court of the United States, 1789-1800: Suits against states|date=1985|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|isbn=9780231088725|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K7jhBkyoKSUC&pg=PA107&lpg=PA107|accessdate=21 June 2017|language=en}}</ref> While Mayor, he focused on the yellow fever epidemics which struck repeatedly.\n\n==Post-Political Life==\n===Founding of Jersey City===\nIn 1804, Varick, who was out of office and politically unpopular in New York City, joined his friend [[Alexander Hamilton]] to create the Associates of the Jersey Company which would lay the groundwork for modern Jersey City through private development. The consortium behind the company were predominantly [[Federalism|Federalists]] who, like Varick and Hamilton, had been swept out of power in the election of 1800 by [[Thomas Jefferson]] and other [[Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republicans]]. Large tracts of land in [[Paulus Hook]] were purchased by the company with the titles owned by Varick and his two cousins, Anthony Dey, a prominent attorney and major land owner, and [[Jacob Radcliff]], a Justice of the New York Supreme Court who would later become mayor of New York City (twice) from 1810-1811 and again from 1815 - 1818. They laid out the city squares and streets that still characterize the neighborhood, giving them names also seen in [[Lower Manhattan]] or after war heroes (Grove, Varick, Mercer, Wayne, Monmouth and Montgomery among them).<ref>{{cite web|title=Associates of the Jersey Company, 1804 Jersey City's Founding Fathers|url=https://njcu.libguides.com/jerseycitypastandpresent/associatesofthejerseycompany|website=njcu.libguides.com|accessdate=18 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 1816, Colonel Varick purchased lots on the north side of Essex Street and built Prospect Hall overlooking the Hudson River. The property was landscaped with lawns and gardens to the waterfront. Varick would become the figurehead of the continuing development of Jersey City, inviting luminary friends such as  Major General [[Marquis de Lafayette]] to visit while touring America in 1824 for special Fourth of July celebrations.

Along with [[Samuel Jones (New York comptroller)|Samuel Jones]], Varick codified New York State's first statutes after Revolution in the [[Laws of New York]] (2 vols., 1789).

Amongst Varick's ancestors are [[Joris Jansen Rapelje]], a member of the [[Council of Twelve Men]] which was the first democratic body in the history of the United States (1641). Varick's maternal grandfather was a colonel in the Continental Army whose house, the [[Dey Mansion]], which would go on to play a pivotal role in the American Revolution.\n\nVarick was one of seven children, his siblings being: Abraham Varick (the great-grandfather of Anna Maria Romeyn Varick, who married [[George Lauder (Scottish industrialist)|George Lauder]] of the [[Lauder Greenway Family]].); Dr. John Varick Jr.; Anne Elting; Sarah Froeligh; Jane De Witt (wife of [[Simeon De Witt]]); and Maria Gilbert.\n\n===Education===\nLittle is known about the specifics of Varick's education before university, though surviving letters indicate that he was educated by private tutors and studied Latin, French, and other subjects. He enrolled in King's College (the original name of [[Columbia University]]) in [[New York City]] in 1771 where he studied under [[John Morin Scott]]. Varick clerked for Scott during his education and after being admitted into the New York Bar in October 1774, Scott made him an offer to be a partner in his firm. Unusually, Varick had not yet graduated from King's College despite having passed the bar and never formally graduated. Later in his career, Varick would become a trustee of King's College for over thirty years.<ref name=\"Lefkowitz2003\">{{cite book|last=Lefkowitz|first=Arthur|title=George Washington's Indispensable Men|date=2003|publisher=Stackpole Books|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OHhyDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA219&lpg=PA219&dq=%22george+washington%22+%22richard+varick%22+trusted&source=bl&ots=tGR1fKUCQX&sig=ACfU3U2VhSeS7RTNhnLUqmjqSUy4gc1C8A&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj3vtLDuvrkAhUYFjQIHUIzBtM4ChDoATAEegQICBAB#v=onepage&q=%22george%20washington%22%20%22richard%20varick%22%20trusted&f=false|accessdate=1 October 2019|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Military career==\n===American Revolutionary War===\n====Service under General Schuyler & Northern Army====\n[[File:Richard varick officer continental army.png|thumb|left|Richard Varick painted c.1787 by [[Ralph Earl]]. The portrait shows Varick in his Continental Army officers uniform although he retired his commission in 1783. The blue decoration is that of the Society of the Cincinnati.]] Eight months into his career in private practice, the [[American Revolutionary War]] began. At the influence of his employer, John Morin Scott, Varick suspended his studies and enlisted in the militia. On June 28, 1775, he was appointed captain of the [[1st New York Regiment]] and after only three days as field officer, was appointed military secretary under General [[Philip Schuyler]]. It was thought that Scott, understanding the administrative and intellectual value of his young partner, secured the appointment. Varick departed New York City with Schuyler on July 4, 1775, to head north to [[Fort Ticonderoga]] and launch the campaign to drive the British out of Canada. En route, the traveling party stopped in Albany briefly where Varick would first meet General [[Benedict Arnold]], who would become a good friend, also played a significant role in Varick's life until Arnold's treason in 1780.\n\nBy the summer of 1776, Schuyler had been felled by multiple illnesses and was reeling from a series of losses on the battlefield. Varick, by this juncture, in part out of necessity, and in part by appointment, was performing three jobs at once: private secretary to Schuyler, quartermaster for all the northern forts held by the Continental Army, and the Northern Army's deputy muster master general. Laterally, actual battlefield commands had been outsourced to Arnold and General [[Horatio Gates]]. Schuyler, recognizing the burden Varick was carrying, promoted him to Lieutenant Colonel. Varick's almost total control of the administration for the Northern Army lead to an even closer friendship between Arnold and Varick.\n\nThat same summer, Arnold was planning his attack effort to stop the British advance down [[Lake Champlain]] in what would be one of the first battles in the history of the [[U.S. Navy]]. With a dearth of available ships, the armada was largely built from scratch by Varick who solved the crisis by contacting his wide network in New York City and the surrounding area to send materials and coastal men who were qualified for such work. While the [[Battle of Valcour Island]] ended in defeat for the navy, it succeeded in slowing the British advance for the winter as they retreaded to their Canadian bases.\n\nVarick also faced run-ins with fellow officers who were not part of Schuyler's faction. General [[Anthony Walton White]], who had briefly served at Washington's aide-de-camp, was accused by Schuyler of looting a private home on the frontier. After denying the charges, White barged into Varick's offices and challenged him to a duel, under the impression that Varick had spoken negatively to his character. Varick, unarmed, narrowly escaped White's attempt to murder him after Varick declined the challenge. \n \nAfter the disastrous [[Battle of Saratoga]], Schuyler was removed from duty by the [[Continental Congress]] in August 1777 and replaced by General Gates. With factionalism rife within the Northern Army, Varick was aligned with Arnold which pitted him against Gates, whom he disliked regardless. Their circle of friendship had also grown to include [[Henry Brockholst Livingston]] and [[Matthew Clarkson]]. Their camaraderie was rudely defined as \"the New York gang\" by [[James Wilkinson]], a partisan of General Gates'.\n\nVarick would quietly and capably continue in his role as the Northern Army's deputy muster master general, though not as Gates' aide-de-camp or private secretary, until January 12, 1780 when the department was abolished by the Continental Congress in a larger reorganization.\n\n====Service under General Arnold====\n[[File:Benedict Arnold.

Hall after John Trumbull, published 1879., 1931 - 1932 - NARA - 532921.tif|thumb|Benedict Arnold]]\nVarick briefly resumed his law in private practice, which proved challenging in his politically volatile hometown of New York City\u2014which was under occupation by the enemy. In August 1780, Benedict Arnold approached Varick about joining his staff at his newly appointed position as commanding officer of [[West Point, New York|West Point]] (then an active military instillation) as his [[aide-de-camp]] and inspector-general.<ref name=\"Cushman2010\"/><ref name=\"Jameson1900\">{{cite book|last1=Jameson|first1=J.

Varick, along with [[David Franks (aide-de-camp)|David Franks]], were arrested. Varick had been ill in bed when informed both of Arnold's treason and his own arrest. Contemporary reports described Varick as spending several days on the edge of madness about Arnold's defection. Despite Arnold writing to Washington personally to say that his aides were not complicit, both Varick and Franks were detained by Washington as a precautionary measure. After a court of inquiry completed its investigation, they found Varick not guilty, and delivered the following:\n\n<blockquote>\u201c''That Lieutenant Colonel Varick\u2019s conduct with respect to the base Peculations and Treasonable Practices of the late General Arnold is not only unimpeachable but think him entitled (throughout every part of his conduct) to a degree of Merit that does him great honor as an Officer and particularly distinguishes him as a sincere Friend to his Country\u2026''\u201d</blockquote>\n\n====Service under General Washington====\nA by-product of the above was the introduction of Varick to [[George Washington]], which would lead to the two working together for the rest of their careers, and lives. This relationship began in 1781 when Washington petitioned the Continental Congress to establish team of writers to record and preserve all of his, and the army's, papers, planning, and correspondence for use by future generations. This would be under the supervision \u201cof a Man of character in whom entire confidence can be placed\u201d. Washington appointed Varick in this role, which made use of his highly respected administrative skills, and would fully rehabilitate his name after the Arnold scandal. Establishing his office at [[Poughkeepsie]], Varick and his assistants spent more than two years in compiling the forty-four folio volumes known as the [[Varick Transcripts]]. Varick served under Washington solely until Washington retired his commission in 1783.<ref name=\"albanyinstitute\">{{cite web|title=Colonel Richard Varick (1753-1831)|url=http://www.albanyinstitute.org/details/items/colonel-richard-varick-1753-1831.html|website=www.albanyinstitute.org|publisher=[[Albany Institute of History and Art]]|accessdate=21 June 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"metmuseum\">{{cite web|title=Relates to General Richard Montgomery {{!}} Letter from Richard Varick to DeWitt Clinton, Governor of New York, requesting repayment of cash he has advanced for expenditures relating to the Internment<!--sic--> of the Remains of the late General Montgomery {{!}} The Met|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/667757|website=metmuseum.org|publisher=[[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|accessdate=21 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nUpon completing the assigned duties after years or work, General Washington wrote:\n<blockquote>\u201c''I take this first opportunity of signifying my entire approbation of the manner in which you have executed the important duties of recording secretary; and the satisfaction I feel in having my papers so properly arranged, and so correctly recorded; and beg you will accept my thanks for the care and attention which you have given to this business and beg you be persuaded, that I shall take pleasure in asserting on every occasion, the sense of entertainment of the fidelity, skill and indefatigable industry manifested by you in the performance of your public duties''.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Writings of Washington|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/cu31924092900400/cu31924092900400_djvu.txt|website=www.archive.org|pages=113\u2013114|publisher=New York Free Press|accessdate=16 October 2019}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAfter he retired from his service in the Continental Army, Varick would remain in service as a colonel in the [[New York State Militia]] until 1801.<ref name=\"Cushman2010\"/>\n\n=====<div style=\"text-align: center;\">The Varick Transcripts</div>=====\nThe Varick Transcripts are deposited in the [[Library of Congress]].

Membership was generally limited to [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]] who had served at least three years in the [[Continental Army]] or [[Continental Navy|Navy]]. The first meeting of the Society was held in May at a dinner at [[Mount Gulian]] (Verplanck House) in [[Fishkill, New York]], before the British [[Evacuation Day (New York)|evacuation from New York City]]. The meeting was chaired by Varick's friend [[Lieutenant Colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Alexander Hamilton]]. The Society has three goals: \"To preserve the rights so dearly won; to promote the continuing union of the states; and to assist members in need, their widows, and their orphans.\" \n\nVarick would also be responsible for maintaining the legacy of George Washington. From 1790 to 1836, celebrations of Washington's birthday in the City included Tammany Hall dinners, Washington Benevolent Society parades, and an intimate open house held each February 22 by [[Mary Simpson (house servant)|Mary Simpson]] (c. 1752 - March 18, 1836), at her John Street grocery.\n\n==Political career==\n===Pre-Mayor===\nVarick was the [[Recorder of New York City]] from 1784 to 1789. An office that no longer exists, it is equatable to 'Chief Legal Officer'. In this office, along with [[Samuel Jones (New York comptroller)|Samuel Jones]], he codified New York State's first statutes after Revolution in the [[Laws of New York]] (2 vols., 1789).

During his term as a member of the New York State Assembly, he was [[Speaker of the New York State Assembly|Speaker]] during the sessions of 1787 and 1788. Varick was appointed the [[New York State Attorney General]] from 1788 to 1789.\n\nRemarkably, due to the elitist nature of the [[New York Constitution|New York State Constitution of 1777]], almost all government positions in the city and state of New York were appointed by the [[Council of Appointment]]. Few, if any, general elections or other democratic functions would exist until 1802. Thus, in the year 1788, Varick was simultaneously the Recorder of New York City, a State Assemblyman representing New York City, the Speaker of the House of the State of New York, and the Attorney General of the State of New York. Though Varick is on record protesting the egregious nature of his occupying multiple offices, it was rationalized at the time that as both an expert administrator and lawyer, he was an ideal choice to fill these myriad offices and to build swiftly the various mechanisms of government. And, that the subsequent laws were codified quickly in the nascent days of an independent New York City and State to ensure the function, and growth, of both entities.\n\n===Mayor of New York City===\n[[File:Richard Varick Signature 1796.jpg|thumb|right|Signature of Richard Varick while Mayor of New York (1798)]]\nMost notably, Varick was the [[Mayor of New York City]] for twelve years during the formative post-Independence era from 1789 to 1801.<ref name=\"Marcus1985\">{{cite book|last1=Marcus|first1=Maeva|last2=Perry|first2=James R.|title=The Documentary History of the Supreme Court of the United States, 1789-1800: Suits against states|date=1985|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|isbn=9780231088725|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K7jhBkyoKSUC&pg=PA107&lpg=PA107|accessdate=21 June 2017|language=en}}</ref> While Mayor, he focused on the yellow fever epidemics which struck repeatedly.\n\n==Post-Political Life==\n===Founding of Jersey City===\nIn 1804, Varick, who was out of office and politically unpopular in New York City, joined his friend [[Alexander Hamilton]] to create the Associates of the Jersey Company which would lay the groundwork for modern Jersey City through private development. The consortium behind the company were predominantly [[Federalism|Federalists]] who, like Varick and Hamilton, had been swept out of power in the election of 1800 by [[Thomas Jefferson]] and other [[Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republicans]]. Large tracts of land in [[Paulus Hook]] were purchased by the company with the titles owned by Varick and his two cousins, Anthony Dey, a prominent attorney and major land owner, and [[Jacob Radcliff]], a Justice of the New York Supreme Court who would later become mayor of New York City (twice) from 1810-1811 and again from 1815 - 1818. They laid out the city squares and streets that still characterize the neighborhood, giving them names also seen in [[Lower Manhattan]] or after war heroes (Grove, Varick, Mercer, Wayne, Monmouth and Montgomery among them).<ref>{{cite web|title=Associates of the Jersey Company, 1804 Jersey City's Founding Fathers|url=https://njcu.libguides.com/jerseycitypastandpresent/associatesofthejerseycompany|website=njcu.libguides.com|accessdate=18 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 1816, Colonel Varick purchased lots on the north side of Essex Street and built Prospect Hall overlooking the Hudson River.

Chief Inspector [[Frederick Abberline]] of [[Scotland Yard]] is assigned by his superiors to investigate the murder and brutal mutilation of a prostitute in the [[East End of London]]. As the mutilated corpses of other \"[[Shilling (British coin)|shilling]] whores\" turn up in the same area, London's tabloid journalists - particularly Benjamin Bates of ''[[The Star (London)|The Star]]'' - whip up a public frenzy. The killer is nicknamed \"Jack the Ripper\" after [[Dear Boss letter|a letter]] bearing that name and supposedly from the killer, is forwarded to Scotland Yard. As the Ripper terrorizes London, public outrage erupts throughout the country, and Police Commissioner [[Sir Charles Warren]] fears that a [[revolution]] is in the air in London's East End.\n\nThere is no shortage of suspects for Abberline and his partner, Sergeant [[George Godley]]. These suspects include the American actor [[Richard Mansfield]] (appearing in the play ''[[Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde|Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]'' in London); police surgeon Dr Henry Llewellyn; [[socialist]] agitator [[George Lusk]]; [[Queen Victoria]]'s [[clairvoyant]] [[Robert James Lees|Robert Lees]]; the Queen's grandson [[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale|Prince Albert Victor]]; and Dr [[Theodore Dyke Acland]], the son-in-law of [[Sir William Gull, 1st Baronet|Sir William Gull]], Royal Surgeon to Queen Victoria and expert on diseases of the brain. The police and the authorities want the murders solved at any cost, but Abberline and Godley face huge obstacles as they search for the truth - and hindrance from their superiors when the killer is finally unmasked.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Michael Caine]] - Chief Inspector [[Frederick Abberline]], an aging [[alcoholic]] whose quest to solve the murders gives him the strength to give up drinking\n* [[Lewis Collins]] - Sergeant [[George Godley]]\n* [[Armand Assante]] - [[Richard Mansfield]], American Stage actor in the theatrical play ''[[Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde|Jekyll and Hyde]]''\n* [[Ray McAnally]] - [[Sir William Gull, 1st Baronet|Sir William Gull]], Physician-in-Ordinary to [[Queen Victoria]] \n* [[Ken Bones]] - [[Robert James Lees]], Queen Victoria's psychic medium\n* [[Susan George (actress)|Susan George]] - [[Catherine Eddowes]], fourth victim of Jack the Ripper\n* [[Jane Seymour (actress)|Jane Seymour]] - Emma Prentiss \n* [[Harry Andrews]] - [[Coroner]] [[Wynne Edwin Baxter|Wynne Baxter]] \n* [[Lysette Anthony]] - [[Mary Jane Kelly]], fifth and last victim of Jack the Ripper\n* [[Gerald Sim]] - Dr. [[George Bagster Phillips]]\n* [[Hugh Fraser (actor)|Hugh Fraser]] - [[Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis|Commissioner of Police]] [[Charles Warren|Sir Charles Warren]]\n* [[Edward Judd]] - Chief Superintendent of Police [[Thomas Arnold (policeman)|Thomas Arnold]]\n* [[George Sweeney (actor)|George Sweeney]] - [[Coach (carriage)|Coach]] driver [[John Netley]]\n* [[Michael Gothard]] - [[George Lusk]], Chairman of the [[Whitechapel Vigilance Committee]], and a violent [[Marxism|Marxist]] and power-hungry politician\n* [[T.

(In real-life, at the time of the Ripper murders, Abberline was married to Emma Beament, the daughter of a merchant. In ''Jack the Ripper'', Emma Prentiss is not married to Abberline.) Furthermore, the series' portrayal of Abberline unmasking the Ripper as William Gull contradicts the fact that the real-life Abberline believed that the Ripper was actually [[George Chapman (murderer)|George Chapman]]. [[George Lusk]] of the [[Whitechapel Vigilance Committee]] was depicted in the film as a violent, argumentative troublemaker when in fact he was very quiet, a good local business man who was known for his peaceful nature, a [[churchwarden]] and a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]]. [[Hugh Fraser (actor)|Hugh Fraser]] wore clothing that his character, [[Sir Charles Warren]], had actually worn. This was both [[Harry Andrews]] and [[Edward Judd]]'s last production. [[Armand Assante]]'s stand-in died during filming. Of her experience filming ''Jack the Ripper'', [[Jane Seymour (actress)|Jane Seymour]] said, \"That was fun. I played it as a redhead, it was a great role, and of course I got to work with the great Michael Caine. I had been warned that Michael is tough on actors and actresses unless they know their lines and are very professional, which mostly I was, but they didn\u2019t tell me that he literally liked to do one take and then go and have lunch with his wife. Which is basically what happened! So you\u2019d show up, and unless the [microphone] landed on you or the camera bumped onto you or he messed up, which he never did, that was it. It was one take, and then you\u2019re on to the next. So that was interesting.\"<ref name=\"Harris\"/> [[Michael Caine]] worked with ''Jack the Ripper'' director David Wickes on another television film: the four-hour, two-part ''Jekyll & Hyde'' (1990), based on [[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde|the book]] by [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]. The story of Jekyll and Hyde is a plot-point in Wickes' ''Jack the Ripper'' series.\n\nUsing historical characters involved in the genuine 1888 hunt for the killer, ''Jack the Ripper'' was written by [[Derek Marlowe]] and David Wickes and [[film director|directed]] by Wickes. The series drew heavily on the same discredited [[Freemasonry|Masonic]]/[[British Royal Family|Royal Family]] [[Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution#Claims of Thomas Stowell|conspiracy theory]] as the 1978 film ''[[Murder By Decree]]''; it is also the account presented in the 2001 film ''[[From Hell (film)|From Hell]]''. This theory was first put forward in the 1960s by [[Thomas E. A. Stowell]] who published his claims in a November 1970 issue of ''The Criminologist''.<ref>Stowell, T. E. A. (November 1970) \"Jack the Ripper&nbsp;\u2013 A Solution?\". ''The Criminologist'' vol.5 pp.40\u201351</ref> The theory was later turned into the bestselling ''[[Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution]]'' (1976) by [[Stephen Knight (author)|Stephen Knight]]. The 1988 series dispenses with the fictional [[Sherlock Holmes]] who uncovered the conspiracy in ''Murder By Decree'' and instead concentrates on the real-life [[Whitechapel]] detective [[Frederick Abberline]], as assisted by Sergeant [[George Godley]].<ref name=eoff>[http://www.eofftv.com/review/j/jack_the_ripper_1988_review.htm ''Jack the Ripper'' reviewed on Eofftv.com]</ref>\n\nThe series is constructed as a [[Whodunit]] in which viewers are led to suspect, at various points, that [[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale|Prince Albert Victor]], [[Richard Mansfield]], [[George Lusk]], Henry Llewellyn or [[Theodore Dyke Acland]] could be Jack the Ripper. Before ''Jack the Ripper'' was broadcast, director/co-writer David Wickes claimed that he had been allowed unprecedented access to the [[Scotland Yard]] files on the [[Jack the Ripper|Ripper]] case and stated that his production would be revealing the 'true' identity of Jack the Ripper for the first time. After pressure from [[Ripperologist]] [[Melvin Harris]] and others, Wickes was forced to withdraw this claim.<ref name=eoff/> Nevertheless, the series begins with a disclaimer on behalf of the production staff, stating, ''\"Our story is based on extensive research, including a review of the official files by special permission of the [[Home Office]] and interviews with leading criminologists and Scotland Yard officials.\"'' The series' \"revelation\" that [[Sir William Gull, 1st Baronet|Sir William Gull]] was Jack the Ripper was not new: Stephen Knight's 1976 book alleged that Gull was the Ripper, and prior to that, the theory had been cited in the 1973 [[BBC]] TV series ''[[Jack the Ripper (1973 TV series)|Jack the Ripper]]'' (two episodes of which were directed by David Wickes). Furthermore, the Ripper character in the film ''Murder by Decree'', assigned the fictitious name \"Sir Thomas Spivey,\" was based on Sir William Gull.\n\nMarlowe and Wickes retained ''The Final Solution''{{'}}s contention that William Gull was Jack the Ripper, but dispensed with most of the rest of the theory: the involvement of Prince Albert Victor is dismissed as a [[Red herring]]; there is no mention of [[Walter Sickert]], Annie Crook, an illegitimate Royal baby, blackmail, or [[Freemasons]]; and the explanation given for the murders is [[dementia]], acquired by Gull from a [[stroke]]. The original script adhered more closely to ''The Final Solution'' but was changed during the course of production: interviewed in 2017, [[Jane Seymour (actress)|Jane Seymour]] stated \"when we first got the script, they kind of implicated the Masons as being involved, and by the time we finished the movie, there was pretty much no mention of the Masons.\"<ref name=\"Harris\">{{cite web |first=Will |last=Harris |url=http://www.avclub.com/article/jane-seymour-how-dr-quinn-was-not-supposed-last-an-253538 |title=Jane Seymour on how Dr. Quinn was not supposed to last and her \"whole new career\" in comedy|date=17 April 2017 |work=[[The A.V. Club]]}}</ref>\n\nThe series ends with Gull's son-in-law, Dr. Theodore Dyke Acland, theorising that Gull was using himself as a case-study of [[multiple personality disorder]] (giving free rein to his murderous impulses in an effort to understand his own multi-faceted mind). The series presents Gull acting of his own accord (with only coachman [[John Netley]] complicit in his crimes), and conspiracy only coming into play ''after'' Gull's arrest: according to the series, Gull's murders were covered up at the behest of police commissioner [[Sir Charles Warren]] to avoid a scandal, as Gull was [[Queen Victoria]]'s physician. The series' denouement thus differs to Stephen Knight's claim that Warren was aware of the Ripper's identity as the crimes were being committed.\n\n''Jack the Ripper'' ends with the following disclaimer:\n\n{{cquote|''In the strange case of Jack the Ripper, there was no trial and no signed confession.''\n\n''In 1888, neither fingerprinting nor bloodtyping was in use and no conclusive forensic, documentary or eye-witness testimony was available. Thus, positive proof of the Ripper\u2019s identity is not available.''\n\n''We have come to our conclusions after careful study and painstaking deduction.

In reality, her ears were left intact, with only the lobe of one ear becoming detached during the transporting of the corpse to the mortuary.\n\nBloodhounds are visible at the scene of Mary Jane Kelly's murder in Miller's Court. While the use of bloodhounds was indeed considered and trialed, they were not actually employed during the investigation.\n\nWhen the body of Mary Jane Kelly is discovered, the view of the corspe through the window is incorrect. It is seen as being face-on, whereas the body was actually side-on, with the head to the right.\n\nSusan George, playing prostitute Catharine Eddowes, is clad in a fashionable and expensive 'Bustle' dress. This garment would have been far beyond the means of women like Eddowes. \n\nFrederick Abberline is depicted as having been transferred to Whitechapel as a form of punishment.

Chief Inspector [[Frederick Abberline]] of [[Scotland Yard]] is assigned by his superiors to investigate the murder and brutal mutilation of a prostitute in the [[East End of London]]. As the mutilated corpses of other \"[[Shilling (British coin)|shilling]] whores\" turn up in the same area, London's tabloid journalists - particularly Benjamin Bates of ''[[The Star (London)|The Star]]'' - whip up a public frenzy. The killer is nicknamed \"Jack the Ripper\" after [[Dear Boss letter|a letter]] bearing that name and supposedly from the killer, is forwarded to Scotland Yard. As the Ripper terrorizes London, public outrage erupts throughout the country, and Police Commissioner [[Sir Charles Warren]] fears that a [[revolution]] is in the air in London's East End.\n\nThere is no shortage of suspects for Abberline and his partner, Sergeant [[George Godley]]. These suspects include the American actor [[Richard Mansfield]] (appearing in the play ''[[Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde|Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]'' in London); police surgeon Dr Henry Llewellyn; [[socialist]] agitator [[George Lusk]]; [[Queen Victoria]]'s [[clairvoyant]] [[Robert James Lees|Robert Lees]]; the Queen's grandson [[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale|Prince Albert Victor]]; and Dr [[Theodore Dyke Acland]], the son-in-law of [[Sir William Gull, 1st Baronet|Sir William Gull]], Royal Surgeon to Queen Victoria and expert on diseases of the brain. The police and the authorities want the murders solved at any cost, but Abberline and Godley face huge obstacles as they search for the truth - and hindrance from their superiors when the killer is finally unmasked.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Michael Caine]] - Chief Inspector [[Frederick Abberline]], an aging [[alcoholic]] whose quest to solve the murders gives him the strength to give up drinking\n* [[Lewis Collins]] - Sergeant [[George Godley]]\n* [[Armand Assante]] - [[Richard Mansfield]], American Stage actor in the theatrical play ''[[Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde|Jekyll and Hyde]]''\n* [[Ray McAnally]] - [[Sir William Gull, 1st Baronet|Sir William Gull]], Physician-in-Ordinary to [[Queen Victoria]] \n* [[Ken Bones]] - [[Robert James Lees]], Queen Victoria's psychic medium\n* [[Susan George (actress)|Susan George]] - [[Catherine Eddowes]], fourth victim of Jack the Ripper\n* [[Jane Seymour (actress)|Jane Seymour]] - Emma Prentiss \n* [[Harry Andrews]] - [[Coroner]] [[Wynne Edwin Baxter|Wynne Baxter]] \n* [[Lysette Anthony]] - [[Mary Jane Kelly]], fifth and last victim of Jack the Ripper\n* [[Gerald Sim]] - Dr. [[George Bagster Phillips]]\n* [[Hugh Fraser (actor)|Hugh Fraser]] - [[Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis|Commissioner of Police]] [[Charles Warren|Sir Charles Warren]]\n* [[Edward Judd]] - Chief Superintendent of Police [[Thomas Arnold (policeman)|Thomas Arnold]]\n* [[George Sweeney (actor)|George Sweeney]] - [[Coach (carriage)|Coach]] driver [[John Netley]]\n* [[Michael Gothard]] - [[George Lusk]], Chairman of the [[Whitechapel Vigilance Committee]], and a violent [[Marxism|Marxist]] and power-hungry politician\n* [[T.

(In real-life, at the time of the Ripper murders, Abberline was married to Emma Beament, the daughter of a merchant. In ''Jack the Ripper'', Emma Prentiss is not married to Abberline.) Furthermore, the series' portrayal of Abberline unmasking the Ripper as William Gull contradicts the fact that the real-life Abberline believed that the Ripper was actually [[George Chapman (murderer)|George Chapman]]. [[George Lusk]] of the [[Whitechapel Vigilance Committee]] was depicted in the film as a violent, argumentative troublemaker when in fact he was very quiet, a good local business man who was known for his peaceful nature, a [[churchwarden]] and a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]]. [[Hugh Fraser (actor)|Hugh Fraser]] wore clothing that his character, [[Sir Charles Warren]], had actually worn. This was both [[Harry Andrews]] and [[Edward Judd]]'s last production. [[Armand Assante]]'s stand-in died during filming. Of her experience filming ''Jack the Ripper'', [[Jane Seymour (actress)|Jane Seymour]] said, \"That was fun. I played it as a redhead, it was a great role, and of course I got to work with the great Michael Caine. I had been warned that Michael is tough on actors and actresses unless they know their lines and are very professional, which mostly I was, but they didn\u2019t tell me that he literally liked to do one take and then go and have lunch with his wife. Which is basically what happened! So you\u2019d show up, and unless the [microphone] landed on you or the camera bumped onto you or he messed up, which he never did, that was it. It was one take, and then you\u2019re on to the next. So that was interesting.\"<ref name=\"Harris\"/> [[Michael Caine]] worked with ''Jack the Ripper'' director David Wickes on another television film: the four-hour, two-part ''Jekyll & Hyde'' (1990), based on [[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde|the book]] by [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]. The story of Jekyll and Hyde is a plot-point in Wickes' ''Jack the Ripper'' series.\n\nUsing historical characters involved in the genuine 1888 hunt for the killer, ''Jack the Ripper'' was written by [[Derek Marlowe]] and David Wickes and [[film director|directed]] by Wickes. The series drew heavily on the same discredited [[Freemasonry|Masonic]]/[[British Royal Family|Royal Family]] [[Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution#Claims of Thomas Stowell|conspiracy theory]] as the 1978 film ''[[Murder By Decree]]''; it is also the account presented in the 2001 film ''[[From Hell (film)|From Hell]]''. This theory was first put forward in the 1960s by [[Thomas E. A. Stowell]] who published his claims in a November 1970 issue of ''The Criminologist''.<ref>Stowell, T. E. A. (November 1970) \"Jack the Ripper&nbsp;\u2013 A Solution?\". ''The Criminologist'' vol.5 pp.40\u201351</ref> The theory was later turned into the bestselling ''[[Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution]]'' (1976) by [[Stephen Knight (author)|Stephen Knight]]. The 1988 series dispenses with the fictional [[Sherlock Holmes]] who uncovered the conspiracy in ''Murder By Decree'' and instead concentrates on the real-life [[Whitechapel]] detective [[Frederick Abberline]], as assisted by Sergeant [[George Godley]].<ref name=eoff>[http://www.eofftv.com/review/j/jack_the_ripper_1988_review.htm ''Jack the Ripper'' reviewed on Eofftv.com]</ref>\n\nThe series is constructed as a [[Whodunit]] in which viewers are led to suspect, at various points, that [[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale|Prince Albert Victor]], [[Richard Mansfield]], [[George Lusk]], Henry Llewellyn or [[Theodore Dyke Acland]] could be Jack the Ripper. Before ''Jack the Ripper'' was broadcast, director/co-writer David Wickes claimed that he had been allowed unprecedented access to the [[Scotland Yard]] files on the [[Jack the Ripper|Ripper]] case and stated that his production would be revealing the 'true' identity of Jack the Ripper for the first time. After pressure from [[Ripperologist]] [[Melvin Harris]] and others, Wickes was forced to withdraw this claim.<ref name=eoff/> Nevertheless, the series begins with a disclaimer on behalf of the production staff, stating, ''\"Our story is based on extensive research, including a review of the official files by special permission of the [[Home Office]] and interviews with leading criminologists and Scotland Yard officials.\"'' The series' \"revelation\" that [[Sir William Gull, 1st Baronet|Sir William Gull]] was Jack the Ripper was not new: Stephen Knight's 1976 book alleged that Gull was the Ripper, and prior to that, the theory had been cited in the 1973 [[BBC]] TV series ''[[Jack the Ripper (1973 TV series)|Jack the Ripper]]'' (two episodes of which were directed by David Wickes). Furthermore, the Ripper character in the film ''Murder by Decree'', assigned the fictitious name \"Sir Thomas Spivey,\" was based on Sir William Gull.\n\nMarlowe and Wickes retained ''The Final Solution''{{'}}s contention that William Gull was Jack the Ripper, but dispensed with most of the rest of the theory: the involvement of Prince Albert Victor is dismissed as a [[Red herring]]; there is no mention of [[Walter Sickert]], Annie Crook, an illegitimate Royal baby, blackmail, or [[Freemasons]]; and the explanation given for the murders is [[dementia]], acquired by Gull from a [[stroke]]. The original script adhered more closely to ''The Final Solution'' but was changed during the course of production: interviewed in 2017, [[Jane Seymour (actress)|Jane Seymour]] stated \"when we first got the script, they kind of implicated the Masons as being involved, and by the time we finished the movie, there was pretty much no mention of the Masons.\"<ref name=\"Harris\">{{cite web |first=Will |last=Harris |url=http://www.avclub.com/article/jane-seymour-how-dr-quinn-was-not-supposed-last-an-253538 |title=Jane Seymour on how Dr. Quinn was not supposed to last and her \"whole new career\" in comedy|date=17 April 2017 |work=[[The A.V. Club]]}}</ref>\n\nThe series ends with Gull's son-in-law, Dr. Theodore Dyke Acland, theorising that Gull was using himself as a case-study of [[multiple personality disorder]] (giving free rein to his murderous impulses in an effort to understand his own multi-faceted mind). The series presents Gull acting of his own accord (with only coachman [[John Netley]] complicit in his crimes), and conspiracy only coming into play ''after'' Gull's arrest: according to the series, Gull's murders were covered up at the behest of police commissioner [[Sir Charles Warren]] to avoid a scandal, as Gull was [[Queen Victoria]]'s physician. The series' denouement thus differs to Stephen Knight's claim that Warren was aware of the Ripper's identity as the crimes were being committed.\n\n''Jack the Ripper'' ends with the following disclaimer:\n\n{{cquote|''In the strange case of Jack the Ripper, there was no trial and no signed confession.''\n\n''In 1888, neither fingerprinting nor bloodtyping was in use and no conclusive forensic, documentary or eye-witness testimony was available. Thus, positive proof of the Ripper\u2019s identity is not available.''\n\n''We have come to our conclusions after careful study and painstaking deduction. Other researchers, criminologists and writers may take a different view.''\n\n''We believe our conclusions to be true.''}}\n\nThe series was originally mounted on a relatively low-budget, with interior photography shot on video-tape and location footage shot on 16-mm film (as was common practice for British television productions of the time). Filming commenced in October 1987, with [[Barry Foster (actor)|Barry Foster]] of ''[[Van der Valk (TV series)|Van der Valk]]'' cast in the role of Abberline.

{"title_page": "Feminist performance art", "text_new": "{{essay-like|date=November 2017}}\nAccording to scholar Virginia Mackenny, [[performance art]] is a great tool to mold and remold gender because performance art, in most instances, includes a direct subversion to everyday conventions. MacKenny also writes that feminist performance Art had a large presence \u201cin the late '60s and early '70s in America when, in the climate of protest constituted by the civil rights movement and [[second wave feminism]].\" There are several movements that fall under the category of feminist performance art, including Feminist Postmodernism, which took place during 1960-1970 and focused on the exploitation of women's bodies as a means for profit. Similarly, the Chicanx movement emerged in East Los Angeles during the 1970s, and focused on the Vietnam war, which was considered a post-apartheid movement.<ref name=\"MacKenny\">{{cite journal|last1=MacKenny|first1=Virginia|title=Post - Apartheid Performance Art as a Site of Gender Resistance|journal=Agenda Empowering Women for Gender Equity|date=2001|volume=49|pages=15\u201324|issn=1013-0950}}</ref>\n\n== Feminist Postmodernism ==\nAs Forte writes in her analysis of feminist performance art in the 1960s and 1970s, \u201cWithin this movement, women's performance emerges as a specific strategy that allies [[postmodernism]] and [[feminism]] \u2026 women used performance as a deconstructive strategy to demonstrate the objectification of women and its results\u201d.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Forte|first1=Jeanie|title=Women's Performance Art: Feminism and Postmodernism|journal=Theatre Journal|date=1988|volume=40.2|issn=0192-2882}}</ref> Another strategy that was commonly used by feminist performance artists during the postmodernist movement was \u201cremoving of the mask,\u201d which was utilized to demonstrate the consequences of female representations in the media, on the psyche of women. MacKenny also writes about the removing of the mask within Feminist Postmodernism. She writes, \u201cThis 'masquerade' or 'masking' occurs when women play with their assigned gender roles in multiple, often contradictory ways - adopting, adapting, overlaying and subverting the hegemonic discourse in the process.\u201d\n\n== Chicanx Movement ==\nDuring the late 1960s and early 1970s in East Los Angeles, protests broke out against the [[Vietnam War]] and its disproportionate death rate of 22% Chicanx people, while the percentage of the population that Chicanx people made up only 5% of the United States entire population.\n[[Asco (art collective)]], based in [[East Los Angeles, California|East LA]] commented on the impacts of the war on [[queer]] and brown identities, as well as the tragedies that occurred in the protests discussed above due to [[police brutality]]. The collective created visual and performative art. Some of their most famous performances experiment with gender roles, for example, one male identifying artist attended a club wearing \u201cbooty shorts, pink platforms, and a shirt that said \u2018just turned 21.\u2019\u201d<ref>{{cite book|last1=Perez|first1=Laura E.|title=Chicana art: the politics of spiritual and aesthetic altarities|date=2007|publisher=Durham: Duke U|isbn=978-0-8223-8988-0|doi=10.1215/9780822389880}}</ref>\nThe group continued to make performance and visual art that engaged with concepts related to queer and [[ethnic identity]] in East LA. During this period, East LA was ghettoized through a border of highways and dilapidated conditions.\n\n== Post Apartheid Movement ==\nMacKenny writes about two of the major players in the Post [[Apartheid]] performance art movement in [[South Africa]]. She first writes about Carol Anne Gainer and her performance entitled 'Exposed.' MacKenny explains that Gainer disrupts and subverts the binary as she performs as both the model and artist in this performance, which works to blur the \"distinction between artist/art, artist/model, constructor/constructed, finder/found, mind/body, subject/object.\"\nThe second artist which Mackenny writes about is a [[mixed race]] artist who performs a piece called 'Span.' MacKenny asserts that the artist Tracey Rose, alludes to Western societies exploitation of people of colour in scientific study and analysis, and the \"dissection and embalming of body parts of native 'others' (the most pertinent to the South African context being Saartje Baartman, a young Khoisan woman displayed for her unique genitalia and steatopygia, or enlarged buttocks),\" through her own display of her body.<ref name=\"MacKenny\"/> Her performance exposes her naked body and is contrasted against images of \"scientific\" exploitation, which both highlights the dichotomy between these subjects and engages with Mackenny's definition of post-apartheid performance art and its political aim to blur and disrupt binary structures.\n\n=== Anti War Performance Art Movement ===\nThe sociologist Rachel V Kutz-Flamenbaum writes about two major players in the anti-war performance art movement during the George W Bush administration. Code Pink, and Raging Grannies challenge and subvert gender norms in their performances, and thus, use very similar tactics and strategies. For instance, in Code Pink, Kutz-Flamenbaum asserts that, \"the emphasis on women\u2019s role as pacifist caregivers presents a nonthreatening image of women activists.\" \n\nThe perpetuated concept of women as non threatening, relies on the audiences association of pink as a non threatening and feminized colour. Kutz-Flamenbaum argues that \"Code Pink\u2019s use of civil disobedience and aggressive trailing of public officials confound and challenge normative gender expectations of women as passive, polite, and well-behaved.\"(95)<ref name=\"Kutz-Flamenbaum\">{{cite journal|last1=Kutz-Flamenbaum|first1=Rachel V|title=Code Pink, Raging Grannies, and the Missile Dick Chicks: Feminist Performance Activism in the Contemporary Anti-War Movement|journal=NWSA Journal|date=Spring 2001|volume=19|issue=1|pages=90\u201396|issn=1040-0656}}</ref>\nKutz-Flamenbaum claims that [[Raging Grannies]] similarly use this tactic in the description of their mission statement. Kutz-Flamenbaum explains that their mission statement \"illustrates the way Raging Grannies use norm- embracing stereotypes of 'little old ladies' and 'grannies' to challenge the gendered assumptions of their audiences.\" Their conscious performance as non-threatening and nurturing women, strategically and tactfully confront issues related to war and challenge the participation of the George W Bush administration in the war. \n\n== Performance Artists ==\n\n==[[Yoko Ono]]==\n\n=== Overview ===\nOno belonged to a generation of early feminist performance artists but is unique among them for her international fame as [[John Lennon]]\u2019s wife in the late 60s and 70s.  During their courtship the couple manipulated the press attention directed on them by documenting their relationship through performance art.<ref name=\":0\">Elizabeth Ann Lindau. \u201cMother Superior\u201d: Maternity and Creativity in the Work of Yoko Ono.\" ''Women and Music: A Journal of Gender and Culture'' 20 (University of Nebraska Press: 2016), 64.</ref> As Ono stated in a 1986 TV interview, \u201cwe were always together\u2026 we exchanged very fully between ourselves.\u201d<ref name=\":1\">''Yoko Ono on John Lennon's Assasination, Their Son Sean and Influencing The Beatles Breakup.'', ''YouTube'' (YouTube, 2017), <nowiki>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Suj8MCysBKQ</nowiki>)</ref> They emphasized this unusual situation, where the husband and wife worked together rather than the pair working separately outside the home, through their performance art \u201cBed-ins.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs an interracial couple they also challenged racial stereotypes. She confessed, \u201cI think it was a big lesson for the world that we were together\u2026 And I think it might have helped too for people to understand what it means to confront the interracial couple.\u201d<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nParenthood is a factor in the controversy surrounding Ono. Women were not usually part of performance art or rock music, and mothers in particular were antithetical to everything rock stood for. The public idea of rock music as youthful male rebellion placed mothers as the opponent. When Ono and Lennon began their relationship, Beatles fans saw this female influence as an intrusion and the force that broke up their favorite band. However, as Ono saw it, the [[The Beatles|Beatles]] grew apart naturally and she was not the primary cause.<ref name=\":1\" /> Public confusion was exacerbated with Ono\u2019s pregnancy. While pregnant with their son Sean, Ono announced to Lennon: \u201cI am carrying the baby nine months and that is enough. You take care of it afterwards.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> After Sean\u2019s birth, she ran the couple\u2019s business while Lennon stayed home as \u201chousehusband.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> Ono\u2019s hands off approach to parenting is a source of controversy because she was simultaneously too motherly and not motherly enough.\n\n=== Work ===\nOne of her early works is [[Cut Piece]], first performed in 1964 at the Yamaichi Concert Hall in Kyoto. She kneeled on the stage in her best suit and invited audience members to use scissors to cut it off of her. Confronting issues of gender, class and cultural identity, Ono sat silently until the piece concluded at her discretion.<ref>Munroe, Alexandra; Ono, Yoko; Hendricks, Jon; Altshuler, Bruce; Ross, David A.; Wenner, Jann S.; Concannon, Kevin C.; Tomii, Reiko; Sayle, Murray; Gomez, Edward M. (October 2000). Yes Yoko Ono. New York: Harry N. Abrams. {{ISBN|0-81094-587-8}}.</ref> Ono also published a book of conceptual art in 1964, entitled [[Grapefruit (book)|Grapefruit]]. The book reads like an instruction manual for the reader to create their own versions of her pieces either physically or in the imagination. Over the nearly 60 years that she has been active, Ono has created installations of modern art across the globe, recorded numerous original songs both with John Lennon and the [[Plastic Ono Band]], as well as individually, and continues in activism to this day.\n\n== Orlan==\nORLAN (born as Mireille Suzanne Francette Porte) is French performance artist, most known for her radical use of plastic surgery to form her work. She uses her face and body as a malleable tool to change her appearance and therefore change her art. She primarily used plastic surgery to morph and change her body in her theatrical expression. Orlan uses her body at the heart of her expression, to articulate her political, social and cultural beliefs. Due to suffering an ectopic pregnancy, she felt her body was changed dramatically, and through that, she chose to turn her body into artwork through the use of plastic surgery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.artnet.com/artists/orlan/|title=ORLAN {{!}} artnet|website=www.artnet.com|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>\n\nOne of her most notable performances was that of the 1977 International Contemporary Art Fair in Paris. On her exterior, she had a large photo of a torso on her chest. This was turned into a slot machine, where the audience could put a coin down the slot and watch it descend into the groin. As a reward, that audience member were given a kiss. She also displayed her sexual organs during menstruation under a magnifying glass for respective audience members to study. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Donger|first=Simon|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XoXFBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=orlan&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjyw_Da7snoAhVxlFwKHZmmAdsQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&q=orlan&f=false|title=ORLAN: A Hybrid Body of Artworks|last2=Shepherd|first2=Simon|date=2010-05-20|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-97128-0|language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Bj\u00f6rk Gu\u00f0mundsd\u00f3ttir ==\nThe musical artist Bj\u00f6rk has been challenging musical barriers since her time in the band [[The Sugarcubes]], which became the biggest alternative rock band in Iceland.

The album was developed into an iPad and iPod app that allowed users to listen to each song while playing games that visually showcased the music. The most notable example is the song \u2018Thunderbolt\u2019  which allows listeners to draw \"Tesla coil charges which alter the bass lines you hear\" and when she performs the song live she has twin Tesla coils to play the bass line.<ref name=\":2\" /> This album however was more than a challenge for Bj\u00f6rk to create a new sound, she created the album as a response to the environmental issues Iceland was facing in 2008. Iceland had allowed the aluminum smelters to take over the countries fishing industry while being the cause for excessive greenhouse gas emissions. Her goal was to create an album that could educate people about the world we are living in and inspire them to take actions against companies that work to destroy the planet.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref>{{Cite news|last=Thorpe|first=Vanessa|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jun/07/bjork-environmental-campaign-timetable-nordic-schools|title=Bj\u00f6rk's environmental campaign goes on the timetable in Nordic schools|date=2014-06-07|work=The Observer|access-date=2020-04-03|last2=arts|language=en-GB|issn=0029-7712|last3=correspondent|first3=media}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/13/bjork-wages-battle-against-icelandic-aluminum/|title=Bj\u00f6rk Wages Battle Against Icelandic Aluminum|last=Kanter|first=James|date=2008-11-13|website=Green Blog|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> \n\n=== 'Declare Independence' and Activism ===\nThis environmental work would not be the only time she has used her music and voice to speak out as the song 'Declare Independence' would often be a song she would use to speak out for the freedom of nations trying to seceded from the nations they have been forced to be apart of.

Her immigration from Cuba to the USA was full of displacement and separation from her homeland and many of her family members for a long period of time. This inspired her future work to explore the aspects of belonging, estrangement, feminism, life, death, violence and overall the rawness of the natural of femininity and the earth. Her fascinations with natures elements: water, fire, earth, air and the flesh were interwoven into her performance art work. She was a huge part of the [https://www.theartstory.org/movement/body-art/ body art movement] which was it's own form that grew as a branch off from the trunk of performance art<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theartstory.org/artist/mendieta-ana/|title=Ana Mendieta Art, Bio, Ideas|website=The Art Story|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref>.

MacKenny also writes that feminist performance Art had a large presence \u201cin the late '60s and early '70s in America when, in the climate of protest constituted by the civil rights movement and [[second wave feminism]].\" There are several movements that fall under the category of feminist performance art, including Feminist Postmodernism, which took place during 1960-1970 and focused on the exploitation of women's bodies as a means for profit. Similarly, the Chicanx movement emerged in East Los Angeles during the 1970s, and focused on the Vietnam war, which was considered a post-apartheid movement.<ref name=\"MacKenny\">{{cite journal|last1=MacKenny|first1=Virginia|title=Post - Apartheid Performance Art as a Site of Gender Resistance|journal=Agenda Empowering Women for Gender Equity|date=2001|volume=49|pages=15\u201324|issn=1013-0950}}</ref>\n\n== Feminist Postmodernism ==\nAs Forte writes in her analysis of feminist performance art in the 1960s and 1970s, \u201cWithin this movement, women's performance emerges as a specific strategy that allies [[postmodernism]] and [[feminism]] \u2026 women used performance as a deconstructive strategy to demonstrate the objectification of women and its results\u201d.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Forte|first1=Jeanie|title=Women's Performance Art: Feminism and Postmodernism|journal=Theatre Journal|date=1988|volume=40.2|issn=0192-2882}}</ref> Another strategy that was commonly used by feminist performance artists during the postmodernist movement was \u201cremoving of the mask,\u201d which was utilized to demonstrate the consequences of female representations in the media, on the psyche of women. MacKenny also writes about the removing of the mask within Feminist Postmodernism. She writes, \u201cThis 'masquerade' or 'masking' occurs when women play with their assigned gender roles in multiple, often contradictory ways - adopting, adapting, overlaying and subverting the hegemonic discourse in the process.\u201d\n\n== Chicanx Movement ==\nDuring the late 1960s and early 1970s in East Los Angeles, protests broke out against the [[Vietnam War]] and its disproportionate death rate of 22% Chicanx people, while the percentage of the population that Chicanx people made up only 5% of the United States entire population.\n[[Asco (art collective)]], based in [[East Los Angeles, California|East LA]] commented on the impacts of the war on [[queer]] and brown identities, as well as the tragedies that occurred in the protests discussed above due to [[police brutality]]. The collective created visual and performative art. Some of their most famous performances experiment with gender roles, for example, one male identifying artist attended a club wearing \u201cbooty shorts, pink platforms, and a shirt that said \u2018just turned 21.\u2019\u201d<ref>{{cite book|last1=Perez|first1=Laura E.|title=Chicana art: the politics of spiritual and aesthetic altarities|date=2007|publisher=Durham: Duke U|isbn=978-0-8223-8988-0|doi=10.1215/9780822389880}}</ref>\nThe group continued to make performance and visual art that engaged with concepts related to queer and [[ethnic identity]] in East LA. During this period, East LA was ghettoized through a border of highways and dilapidated conditions.\n\n== Post Apartheid Movement ==\nMacKenny writes about two of the major players in the Post [[Apartheid]] performance art movement in [[South Africa]]. She first writes about Carol Anne Gainer and her performance entitled 'Exposed.' MacKenny explains that Gainer disrupts and subverts the binary as she performs as both the model and artist in this performance, which works to blur the \"distinction between artist/art, artist/model, constructor/constructed, finder/found, mind/body, subject/object.\"\nThe second artist which Mackenny writes about is a [[mixed race]] artist who performs a piece called 'Span.' MacKenny asserts that the artist Tracey Rose, alludes to Western societies exploitation of people of colour in scientific study and analysis, and the \"dissection and embalming of body parts of native 'others' (the most pertinent to the South African context being Saartje Baartman, a young Khoisan woman displayed for her unique genitalia and steatopygia, or enlarged buttocks),\" through her own display of her body.<ref name=\"MacKenny\"/> Her performance exposes her naked body and is contrasted against images of \"scientific\" exploitation, which both highlights the dichotomy between these subjects and engages with Mackenny's definition of post-apartheid performance art and its political aim to blur and disrupt binary structures.\n\n=== Anti War Performance Art Movement ===\nThe sociologist Rachel V Kutz-Flamenbaum writes about two major players in the anti-war performance art movement during the George W Bush administration. Code Pink, and Raging Grannies challenge and subvert gender norms in their performances, and thus, use very similar tactics and strategies. For instance, in Code Pink, Kutz-Flamenbaum asserts that, \"the emphasis on women\u2019s role as pacifist caregivers presents a nonthreatening image of women activists.\" \n\nThe perpetuated concept of women as non threatening, relies on the audiences association of pink as a non threatening and feminized colour. Kutz-Flamenbaum argues that \"Code Pink\u2019s use of civil disobedience and aggressive trailing of public officials confound and challenge normative gender expectations of women as passive, polite, and well-behaved.\"(95)<ref name=\"Kutz-Flamenbaum\">{{cite journal|last1=Kutz-Flamenbaum|first1=Rachel V|title=Code Pink, Raging Grannies, and the Missile Dick Chicks: Feminist Performance Activism in the Contemporary Anti-War Movement|journal=NWSA Journal|date=Spring 2001|volume=19|issue=1|pages=90\u201396|issn=1040-0656}}</ref>\nKutz-Flamenbaum claims that [[Raging Grannies]] similarly use this tactic in the description of their mission statement. Kutz-Flamenbaum explains that their mission statement \"illustrates the way Raging Grannies use norm- embracing stereotypes of 'little old ladies' and 'grannies' to challenge the gendered assumptions of their audiences.\" Their conscious performance as non-threatening and nurturing women, strategically and tactfully confront issues related to war and challenge the participation of the George W Bush administration in the war. \n\n== Performance Artists ==\n\n==[[Yoko Ono]]==\n\n=== Overview ===\nOno belonged to a generation of early feminist performance artists but is unique among them for her international fame as [[John Lennon]]\u2019s wife in the late 60s and 70s.  During their courtship the couple manipulated the press attention directed on them by documenting their relationship through performance art.<ref name=\":0\">Elizabeth Ann Lindau. \u201cMother Superior\u201d: Maternity and Creativity in the Work of Yoko Ono.\" ''Women and Music: A Journal of Gender and Culture'' 20 (University of Nebraska Press: 2016), 64.</ref> As Ono stated in a 1986 TV interview, \u201cwe were always together\u2026 we exchanged very fully between ourselves.\u201d<ref name=\":1\">''Yoko Ono on John Lennon's Assasination, Their Son Sean and Influencing The Beatles Breakup.'', ''YouTube'' (YouTube, 2017), <nowiki>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Suj8MCysBKQ</nowiki>)</ref> They emphasized this unusual situation, where the husband and wife worked together rather than the pair working separately outside the home, through their performance art \u201cBed-ins.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs an interracial couple they also challenged racial stereotypes. She confessed, \u201cI think it was a big lesson for the world that we were together\u2026 And I think it might have helped too for people to understand what it means to confront the interracial couple.\u201d<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nParenthood is a factor in the controversy surrounding Ono. Women were not usually part of performance art or rock music, and mothers in particular were antithetical to everything rock stood for. The public idea of rock music as youthful male rebellion placed mothers as the opponent. When Ono and Lennon began their relationship, Beatles fans saw this female influence as an intrusion and the force that broke up their favorite band. However, as Ono saw it, the [[The Beatles|Beatles]] grew apart naturally and she was not the primary cause.<ref name=\":1\" /> Public confusion was exacerbated with Ono\u2019s pregnancy. While pregnant with their son Sean, Ono announced to Lennon: \u201cI am carrying the baby nine months and that is enough. You take care of it afterwards.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> After Sean\u2019s birth, she ran the couple\u2019s business while Lennon stayed home as \u201chousehusband.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> Ono\u2019s hands off approach to parenting is a source of controversy because she was simultaneously too motherly and not motherly enough.\n\n=== Work ===\nOne of her early works is [[Cut Piece]], first performed in 1964 at the Yamaichi Concert Hall in Kyoto. She kneeled on the stage in her best suit and invited audience members to use scissors to cut it off of her. Confronting issues of gender, class and cultural identity, Ono sat silently until the piece concluded at her discretion.<ref>Munroe, Alexandra; Ono, Yoko; Hendricks, Jon; Altshuler, Bruce; Ross, David A.; Wenner, Jann S.; Concannon, Kevin C.; Tomii, Reiko; Sayle, Murray; Gomez, Edward M.

The book reads like an instruction manual for the reader to create their own versions of her pieces either physically or in the imagination. Over the nearly 60 years that she has been active, Ono has created installations of modern art across the globe, recorded numerous original songs both with John Lennon and the [[Plastic Ono Band]], as well as individually, and continues in activism to this day.\n\n== Orlan==\nORLAN (born as Mireille Suzanne Francette Porte) is French performance artist, most known for her radical use of plastic surgery to form her work. She uses her face and body as a malleable tool to change her appearance and therefore change her art. She primarily used plastic surgery to morph and change her body in her theatrical expression. Orlan uses her body at the heart of her expression, to articulate her political, social and cultural beliefs. Due to suffering an ectopic pregnancy, she felt her body was changed dramatically, and through that, she chose to turn her body into artwork through the use of plastic surgery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.artnet.com/artists/orlan/|title=ORLAN {{!}} artnet|website=www.artnet.com|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>\n\nOne of her most notable performances was that of the 1977 International Contemporary Art Fair in Paris. On her exterior, she had a large photo of a torso on her chest. This was turned into a slot machine, where the audience could put a coin down the slot and watch it descend into the groin. As a reward, that audience member were given a kiss.
