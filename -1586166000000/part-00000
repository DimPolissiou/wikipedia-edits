As Howe tells it, the recording can be traced to an incident in which 5th Dimension lead singer [[Billy Davis Jr.]] left his wallet in a New York City cab; the man who found the wallet was involved in the production of ''Hair'' and invited the group to see the show: \"After they'd seen it I received a phone call in which they were all talking over one another, saying 'We've got to cut this song \"Aquarius\". It's\nthe best thing ever.'\" Howe was skeptical (\"This isn't a complete song. It's an introduction.\"), but after seeing the show on stage got the idea to create a medley with another musical moment from the show, a few bars from the song \"The Flesh Failures\" that consist of the repeated words \"let the sunshine in.\" Although the two song fragments are in different keys and tempos, Howe resolved to \"jam them together like two trains.\"<ref name=\"classic tracks\">{{cite web |url=https://www.soundonsound.com/people/classic-tracks-fifth-dimension-aquariuslet-sunshine |title=CLASSIC TRACKS: Fifth Dimension 'Aquarius/Let The Sunshine In' |date=February 2006 |work= Sound on Sound |accessdate=June 16, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe instrumental track was set to tape at [[Wally Heider Studios |Wally Heider Recording]] in Los Angeles by the [[The Wrecking Crew (music)|Wrecking Crew]] rhythm section of [[Hal Blaine]] on drums, [[Joe Osborn]] on bass, [[Larry Knechtel]] on keyboards, and [[Tommy Tedesco]] on guitar along with guitarist [[Dennis Budimir]]. However, the vocals were recorded separately in Las Vegas, where the 5th Dimension was performing at the time, using only two microphones for the five singers. Davis' solo during \"Let the Sunshine In\" was improvised during the session; songwriter [[Jimmy Webb]], who happened into the studio during the recording, remarked to Howe, \"My God, that's a number one record.\"<ref name=\"classic tracks\"/>\n\nThis song was one of the most popular songs of [[1969 in music|1969]] worldwide, and in the United States it reached the number one position on both the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] (for six weeks in April and May) and the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Easy Listening]] chart. It also reached the top of the sales charts in Canada and elsewhere. ''Billboard'' ranked it as the No. 2 Hot 100 single for 1969.<ref name=\"Top69\"/>\n\nThe recording won both the [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal|Best Pop Vocal Performance by a Group]] for the [[Grammy Awards of 1970]], after being published on the album ''[[The Age of Aquarius (album)|The Age of Aquarius]]'' by the 5th Dimension, and also being released as a [[7 inch single|seven-inch vinyl single]] record.\n\nThe lyrics of this song were based on the [[astrology|astrological]] belief that the world would soon be entering the \"[[Age of Aquarius]]\", an age of love, light, and humanity, unlike the current \"[[Age of Pisces#The Age of Pisces (The Piscean Age)|Age of Pisces]]\". The exact circumstances for the change are \"When the moon is in the seventh house, and Jupiter aligns with Mars.\" This change was presumed to occur at the end of the 20th century; however, astrologers differ extremely widely as to when. Their proposed dates range from 2062 to 2680.\n\nAstrologer [[Neil Spencer]] denounced the lyrics as \"astrological gibberish\", noting that Jupiter forms an [[astrological aspect]] with Mars several times a year and the moon is in the 7th&nbsp;House for two hours every day.<ref>Neil Spencer, ''True as the Stars Above'', 2000, p. 124.</ref>\nThese lines are considered by many{{who?|date=September 2016}} to be merely [[poetic license]], though some people take them literally.\n\nThe [[American Film Institute]]'s [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs|100 Years...100 Songs]] list, published in 2004, ranked \"Medley: Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In (The Flesh Failures)\" as number 33.\n\n{{listen\n| filename=Aquarius - Let the Sunshine In (song from Hair - sample).ogg\n| title=\"Aquarius\"\n| description=A chorus from the Original Broadway Cast\n| format=[[Ogg]]\n| filename2=The Flesh Failures (Let The Sunshine In).ogg\n| title2=\"The Flesh Failures/Let the Sunshine In\"\n| description2=The last verse of \"The Flesh Failures\" and first chorus of \"Let the Sunshine In\" from the Original Broadway Cast\n| format2=[[Ogg]]}}\n\n== Track listing of the single==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

and [[Gerome Ragni]] (lyrics), and [[Galt MacDermot]] (music), released as a single by American R&B group [[The 5th Dimension]]. The song spent six weeks at number one on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] pop singles chart in the spring of 1969 and was eventually [[Music recording sales certification|certified]] platinum in the US by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-age-of-aquarius-mw0000060028 AllMusic.com] ''The Age of Aquarius'' page Accessed: November 8, 2013</ref> Instrumental backing was written by [[Bill Holman (musician)| Bill Holman]] and provided by session musicians commonly known as [[The Wrecking Crew (music)|the Wrecking Crew]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Kent |last=Hartman |pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780312619749/page/261 261\u2013263] |year=2012 |title=The Wrecking Crew |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780312619749 |url-access=registration |publisher=[[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Griffin]] |isbn=978-1-250-03046-7}}</ref><ref>[https://www.discogs.com/The-5th-Dimension-Medley-Aquarius-Let-The-Sunshine-In-The-Flesh-Failures-Dontcha-Hear-Me-Callin-To-Y/release/10489265 Discogs credits for Bill Holman 'Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In']</ref> The actual recording is something of a \"rarity\"; the song was recorded in two cities, Los Angeles and Las Vegas, then mixed together in the studio.\n\nThe song listed at number 66 on ''Billboard'''s \"Greatest Songs of All Time\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/list/2155531/the-hot-100-all-time-top-songs?list_page=3 |title=Hot 100 55th Anniversary: The All-Time Top 100 Songs |publisher=Billboard |date=1980-12-08 |accessdate=2014-05-24}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe recording was led by veteran American producer and engineer [[Bones Howe]], who had previously worked with the 5th Dimension as well as [[the Mamas & the Papas]] and [[Elvis Presley]]. As Howe tells it, the recording can be traced to an incident in which 5th Dimension lead singer [[Billy Davis Jr.]] left his wallet in a New York City cab; the man who found the wallet was involved in the production of ''Hair'' and invited the group to see the show: \"After they'd seen it I received a phone call in which they were all talking over one another, saying 'We've got to cut this song \"Aquarius\". It's\nthe best thing ever.'\" Howe was skeptical (\"This isn't a complete song. It's an introduction.\"), but after seeing the show on stage got the idea to create a medley with another musical moment from the show, a few bars from the song \"The Flesh Failures\" that consist of the repeated words \"let the sunshine in.\" Although the two song fragments are in different keys and tempos, Howe resolved to \"jam them together like two trains.\"<ref name=\"classic tracks\">{{cite web |url=https://www.soundonsound.com/people/classic-tracks-fifth-dimension-aquariuslet-sunshine |title=CLASSIC TRACKS: Fifth Dimension 'Aquarius/Let The Sunshine In' |date=February 2006 |work= Sound on Sound |accessdate=June 16, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe instrumental track was set to tape at [[Wally Heider Studios |Wally Heider Recording]] in Los Angeles by the [[The Wrecking Crew (music)|Wrecking Crew]] rhythm section of [[Hal Blaine]] on drums, [[Joe Osborn]] on bass, [[Larry Knechtel]] on keyboards, and [[Tommy Tedesco]] on guitar along with guitarist [[Dennis Budimir]]. However, the vocals were recorded separately in Las Vegas, where the 5th Dimension was performing at the time, using only two microphones for the five singers. Davis' solo during \"Let the Sunshine In\" was improvised during the session; songwriter [[Jimmy Webb]], who happened into the studio during the recording, remarked to Howe, \"My God, that's a number one record.\"<ref name=\"classic tracks\"/>\n\nThis song was one of the most popular songs of [[1969 in music|1969]] worldwide, and in the United States it reached the number one position on both the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] (for six weeks in April and May) and the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Easy Listening]] chart. It also reached the top of the sales charts in Canada and elsewhere. ''Billboard'' ranked it as the No. 2 Hot 100 single for 1969.<ref name=\"Top69\"/>\n\nThe recording won both the [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal|Best Pop Vocal Performance by a Group]] for the [[Grammy Awards of 1970]], after being published on the album ''[[The Age of Aquarius (album)|The Age of Aquarius]]'' by the 5th Dimension, and also being released as a [[7 inch single|seven-inch vinyl single]] record.\n\nThe lyrics of this song were based on the [[astrology|astrological]] belief that the world would soon be entering the \"[[Age of Aquarius]]\", an age of love, light, and humanity, unlike the current \"[[Age of Pisces#The Age of Pisces (The Piscean Age)|Age of Pisces]]\". The exact circumstances for the change are \"When the moon is in the seventh house, and Jupiter aligns with Mars.\" This change was presumed to occur at the end of the 20th century; however, astrologers differ extremely widely as to when. Their proposed dates range from 2062 to 2680.\n\nAstrologer [[Neil Spencer]] denounced the lyrics as \"astrological gibberish\", noting that Jupiter forms an [[astrological aspect]] with Mars several times a year and the moon is in the 7th&nbsp;House for two hours every day.<ref>Neil Spencer, ''True as the Stars Above'', 2000, p. 124.</ref>\nThese lines are considered by many{{who?|date=September 2016}} to be merely [[poetic license]], though some people take them literally.\n\nThe [[American Film Institute]]'s [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs|100 Years...100 Songs]] list, published in 2004, ranked \"Medley: Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In (The Flesh Failures)\" as number 33.\n\n{{listen\n| filename=Aquarius - Let the Sunshine In (song from Hair - sample).ogg\n| title=\"Aquarius\"\n| description=A chorus from the Original Broadway Cast\n| format=[[Ogg]]\n| filename2=The Flesh Failures (Let The Sunshine In).ogg\n| title2=\"The Flesh Failures/Let the Sunshine In\"\n| description2=The last verse of \"The Flesh Failures\" and first chorus of \"Let the Sunshine In\" from the Original Broadway Cast\n| format2=[[Ogg]]}}\n\n== Track listing of the single==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

He first reached his career-high singles ranking of world No. 1 in January 2013.\n\nHe has won 17 World Tour Singles titles and has won the World Championships in men's doubles 3 times, mixed doubles 2 times, and fives times in the team event. In addition, Xu Xin along with Ma Long and Zhang Jike won the [[Table tennis at the 2016 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's team|men's team]] title at the [[2016 Summer Olympics]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]].\n\n==Playing style and equipment==\n[[File:Xu Xin 2012.jpg|thumb|left|235px|Xu Xin in the men's final of the Qatar Open 2012]]\nXu Xin is a Stiga sponsored athlete. He uses a Stiga Dynasty Carbon as his blade, with DHS TG2 Skyline national version for his forehand and DHS NEO Hurricane 3 custom sponge on his backhand (37degrees hardness). \n\nXu Xin is one of the few penhold grip players in China, especially among the younger generation who are mostly shakehand players. He follows the footsteps of other penhold champions such as [[Wang Hao (table tennis, born 1983)|Wang Hao]] and [[Ma Lin (table tennis)|Ma Lin]].\n\nWith his long arms and frame, he is able to more easily reach balls hit wide. His long arms enable a graceful, unique forehand loop, with his arm almost fully outstretched. He has also adopted the reverse penhold backhand grip (RPB), a recent development for China's penholders, allowing a two-winged attack. He still uses a traditional penhold backhand to lob and push the ball with the forehand side of his racket. More recently, Xu Xin has been more willing to counter with his RPB, allowing him to maintain aggression in the points on his backhand side.\n\nXu Xin's main strength is his shot variation and blazing forehand loops, often stepping very deep into his backhand corner to use his forehand. He sets these shots up with his extremely spinny and deceptive serves, and has some of the best footwork in table tennis. He is also something of a 'crowd entertainer\u2019, often coming up with wild, and sometimes inappropriate, shots. He has been dubbed the 'show man' in recent years. This is perhaps due to his playful nature and confidence in playing. He admitted that he hopes to try to be more efficient and effective with his shot selection as he matures and carries more responsibilities. More recently, Xu Xin has been called \"XUperman\", referring to his many \"superman-like\" moments. These names have been widely popularized by the use of Adam Bobrow, an ITTF commentator.\n\n==Career==\n===2013===\nIn January 2013, he reached the No. 1 spot in the World Rankings thanks to the points obtained by winning the ITTF World Tour Grand Finals in December 2012.\n\n===2014===\nIn January 2014, Xu Xin defended his title by beating world No. 1 ranked [[Ma Long (table tennis)|Ma Long]] in the finals match of the 2013 ITTF World Tour Grand Finals held in Dubai.\n\n===2016===\nIn 2016, Xu Xin defeated world No. 1 ranked and current World Champion Ma Long 4\u20132 in the semi-finals match of the 2016 Japan Open, but then was beaten by world No. 2 ranked [[Fan Zhendong]] in the finals. One week later after the Japan Open, Xu Xin won his third Korea Open title after beating [[Ma Long (table tennis)|Ma Long]] again 4\u20133 in the finals.<ref>http://www.ittf.com/_front_page/ittf_full_story1.asp?ID=44790&Competition_ID=2663&</ref><ref>http://www.ittf.com/_front_page/ittf_full_story1.asp?ID=44896&Competition_ID=2664&</ref>\n\nHowever, he was deemed not good enough to be entered into the singles tournament of the [[Rio 2016 Summer Olympics]].\n\n===2017===\nIn late 2017, he had a disappointing German Open, where in doubles Xu and his partner Fan Zhendong were knocked out in the Round of 16, and lost in the Quarterfinals to Lee Sangsu 4\u20130 in the singles event. In the Swedish Open, he won the doubles event with Fan Zhendong, before defeating Fan, the world No. 2, 4\u20131 one hour later in the Men's Singles event. At the [[2017 ITTF World Tour Grand Finals]], Xu Xin was seeded 5th and lost to 3rd seed Fan Zhendong in the quarter-finals.\n\n===2018===\nXu Xin started his 2018 year by participating with teammates [[Ma Long (table tennis)|Ma Long]], [[Fan Zhendong]], [[Lin Gaoyuan]] and [[Yu Ziyang]] in the [[2018 ITTF Team World Cup \u2013 Men's team|2018 ITTF Team World Cup]], beating Japan in the final. During the tournament, Xu only dropped one set.\n\nXu Xin entered one of the six platinum events of the tour, the [[2018 Qatar Open (table tennis)|Qatar Open,]] seeking an unprecedented fourth title. He almost suffered a defeat to Zhou Yu winning 4\u20133, but he was beaten by Fan Zhendong in the semi-finals 4\u20131. The following day, Xu Xin along with Fan Zhendong beat Jun Mizutani and Yuya Oshima to claim the men's doubles title. One week later at the [[2018 German Open (table tennis)|German Open]], Xu was seeded third but lost to fifth seeded Ma Long in the final. Xu Xin partnered Ma Long to claim his second doubles title of the year defeating [[Lee Sang-su]] and [[Jeoung Young-sik|Jeong Young-sik]] in the final.\n\nThe next month, Xu Xin was a part of the winning team China at the [[2018 World Team Table Tennis Championships]] in his tenth appearance at the World Championships. Xu earned the final point for team China during the final, beating [[Patrick Franziska]] 3\u20131 for China to claim the title with a 3\u20130 win over Germany.\n\nAt the China Open, Xu Xin was looking for his first World Tour title of the year. However, his ambitions were stopped in his home country by Lim Jong-hoon in the Round of 32. At the next World Tour platinum event, the [[2018 Korea Open (table tennis)|Korea Open]], Xu Xin was seeded 3rd but lost in the Round of 16 to [[Jang Woo-jin]].\n\nLooking to redeem himself, Xu Xin claimed the title at the [[2018 Australian Open (table tennis)|Australian Open]] beating qualifier [[Liu Dingshuo]] in the final, Xu Xin's first World Tour title of the year. Right after that, Xu Xin claimed another title at the [[2018 Bulgaria Open (table tennis)|Bulgaria Open]] beating Japan's [[Kenta Matsudaira]] in the final. Xu Xin claimed his third men's doubles titles with Ma Long at the Bulgarian Open, their second title as a pair in 2018.\n\nBecause of his lack of participation in the [[Asian Cup Table Tennis Tournament|Asian Cup]] earlier that year, Xu Xin did not participate in the [[2018 ITTF Men's World Cup]].\n\nAt the [[2018 Swedish Open (table tennis)|Swedish Open]], Xu Xin was looking to defend his title, but lost to top seed Fan Zhendong in the final. Two days later at the [[2018 Austrian Open (table tennis)|Austrian Open]], Xu Xin lost in the final to qualifier Liang Jingkun 4\u20133 after Liang Jingkun had stunningly beat Fan Zhendong 4\u20132 in the semi-finals. Xu also claimed his first mixed doubles title ever at the Austrian Open, winning with Liu Shiwen over [[Cheng I-ching|Cheng-I-Ching]] and [[Chen Chien-an]] in the final.\n\nDue to Xu's appearance in five finals and claiming two of the titles, Xu Xin was seeded first in the [[2018 ITTF World Tour Grand Finals]], followed closely by Fan Zhendong, Ma Long, and Liang Jingkun. Xu Xin lost to compatriot Lin Gaoyuan in the quarter-finals, 4-2. \n\n=== 2019 ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2019}}\nXu Xin started off the year at the [[2019 Hungarian Open (table tennis)|2019 Hungarian Open]] where he reached the semi-finals. Xu Xin lost to the eventual champion [[Lin Gaoyuan]].\n\nAt the [[2019 Qatar Open (table tennis)|Qatar Open]], Xu Xin faced off against his old rival [[Ma Long (table tennis)|Ma Long]] in the semi-final stage. Ma Long had just returned from injury and was making his first appearance on the ITTF World Tour since many months before. In a highly anticipated match, Xu Xin eventually lost to eventual champion Ma Long, where he beat Lin Gaoyuan in the finals. \n\nHeading in as the number 2 seed at the [[2019 World Table Tennis Championships|2019 ITTF World Table Tennis Championships]], Xu Xin was looking to prove himself during this competition. He participated in the men's singles and mixed doubles with [[Liu Shiwen]]. After the draw was made, Xu Xin was the only Chinese player in the bottom half of the draw. Because of the seedings, #1 [[Fan Zhendong]], #3 [[Lin Gaoyuan]], #9 [[Liang Jingkun]], and #11 [[Ma Long (table tennis)|Ma Long]] were all drawn in the top half of the draw. Much pressure was placed on Xu to help achieve an all Chinese final, but was also a large opportunity for Xu Xin to perform well at a World Championships. Xu Xin won his first round 4-1 against Jan Zibrat and his second round 4-0 over Austria's Stefan Fegerl. However, Xu's road to the final was stopped by Frenchman [[Simon Gauzy]] 4-2. Gauzy outperformed Xu and Gauzy is even said to have \"outspinned the spin master\". Xu's shocking defeat meant that for the first time in over 15 years, there would not be an all Chinese final. The last time this happened was at the [[2003 World Table Tennis Championships|2003 World Championships]], where Austria's [[Werner Schlager]] faced off against [[Joo Sae-hyuk|Joo Saehyuk]] in the men's final. In the mixed doubles event, Xu did not falter, where Xu Xin and Liu Shiwen claimed victory 4-1 over [[Kasumi Ishikawa]] and [[Maharu Yoshimura]].\n\nAt the [[2019 Japan Open (table tennis)|2019 Japan Open]], Xu Xin became the second person in history to achieve a coveted \"triple crown\", the first being Jang Woojin at the 2018 Korea Open. Xu Xin claimed the champion in singles, men's doubles, and mixed doubles. In the men's singles final, Xu Xin defeated [[Lin Yun-ju]], \"the silent assassin\", in a highly anticipated final. Xu Xin claimed doubles titles with Fan Zhendong and [[Zhu Yuling]].\n\nXu Xin's performance at the Japan Open was enough to place him again at number one in the world, a position that he last held in early 2015. He replaced Fan Zhendong from the position, who had previously held the spot for over a year. Fan Zhendong dropped to #3 in the world rankings.\n\nThe following week at the [[Korea Open (table tennis)|Korea Open]], Xu Xin once again claimed the singles title in the final, defeating his good-friend Ma Long in the final. Coming into the final, Xu Xin had lost his six previous encounters against Ma Long on the international stage, and Ma was heavily regarded as the favorite to win. After an amazing match, Xu Xin said that \"Winning the title is not the reason I am feeling so happy. It\u2019s because I beat Ma Long\", paying homage to Ma Long's dominance over the past years. Xu Xin again won the men's doubles title with Fan Zhendong, but in the mixed doubles Xu Xin and [[Liu Shiwen]] were defeated by [[Wong Chun Ting]] and [[Doo Hoi Kem]] at the final stage. This marked the first ever loss for the pairing of Xu Xin and Liu Shiwen, recent mixed doubles world champions at the [[2019 World Table Tennis Championships \u2013 Mixed Doubles|2019 ITTF World Table Tennis Championships]].\n\nThe next week at the [[Australian Open (table tennis)|Australian Open]], Xu Xin claimed three men's singles championships in a row on the [[ITTF World Tour]], and became the first person to successfully defend a men's singles title at the Australian Open. Xu Xin beat his colleague [[Wang Chuqin]] in the final 4-0; Wang Chuqin had defeated Ma Long at the semi-final stage.\n\nAfter the Australian Open, the first of the T2 Events were played in Malaysia. In this tournament, Xu Xin showed signs of slowness and tiredness, proposed to be due to the many weeks of play on the world tour. Xu Xin made it to the semi-finals, where he lost to Fan Zhendong 4-0 in a rematch of their semi-final match at the Japan Open earlier this year, where Xu won 4-3.\n\nMany of the Chinese players have vocalized their dislike of many ITTF events being played one after the other, with no real breaks in between. After the final in Australia, Xu Xin responded \"too tired\". Ma Long and other Chinese players also said the same, but it is said that competitions must be played in order to maintain higher world rankings for the Chinese players, all in preparation for Tokyo 2020. \n\nAt the [[Chinese National Championships (table tennis)|2019 Chinese National Championships]], Xu Xin and four of his other prominent colleagues, [[Ma Long (table tennis)|Ma Long]], [[Fan Zhendong]], [[Liu Shiwen]], and [[Ding Ning]] all pulled out of the competition. Their reasoning was for them to rest up after they had just played several events back to back on the ITTF World Tour.\n\nXu Xin ended the year as the World No. 1.\n\nDue to his outstanding performances and showman-like qualities, Xu Xin gained the nickname of \"XUperman\", holding true to his superhuman play. This nickname is one of Xu Xin's many, the others being the Showman and the Cloudwalker, all descriptive of his playing style.\n\n==Career statistics==\n[[File:ITTF World Tour 2017 German Open Xu Xin 05.jpg|thumb|235px|ITTF World Tour 2017 German Open|alt=]]\n\n===ITTF Major tournament performance timeline===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Key\n| style=\"background:lime;\" |W\n| style=\"background:thistle;\" |F\n| bgcolor=\"yellow\" |SF\n| bgcolor=\"ffebcd\" |QF\n| bgcolor=\"afeeee\" |#R\n| bgcolor=\"afeeee\" |RR\n|A\n|NH\n|}\n<small>(W) Won; (F) finalist; (SF) semi-finalist; (QF) quarterfinalist; (#R) rounds 4, 3, 2, 1; (RR) round-robin stage; (A) Absent; (NH) Not Held; (S) Singles Tournament; (D) Doubles Tournament; (XD) Mixed Doubles Tournament; (T) Team Tournament.</small>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align::center; font-size: small;\"\n! colspan=\"2\" |Tournament\n!2009\n!2010\n!2011\n!2012\n!2013\n!2014\n!2015\n!2016\n!2017\n!2018\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |World Cup\n|S\n|A\n|A\n|A\n| bgcolor=\"yellow\" |SF\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|A\n|A\n| style=\"background:thistle;\"|F\n|A\n|A\n|-\n|T\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|NH\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" |World Championships\n|S\n| bgcolor=\"afeeee\"|3R\n|NH\n| bgcolor=\"afeeee\"|4R\n|NH\n| bgcolor=\"yellow\" |SF\n|NH\n| bgcolor=\"afeeee\"|4R\n|NH\n| bgcolor=\"yellow\" |SF\n|NH\n|-\n|T\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|-\n|D\n| style=\"background:thistle;\"|F\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|NH\n|A\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|NH\n|-\n|XD\n| bgcolor=\"ffebcd\"|QF\n|NH\n|A\n|NH\n|A\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|NH\n|A\n|NH\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |World Tour Grand Finals\n|S\n| style=\"background:thistle;\"|F\n| style=\"background:thistle;\"|F\n|A\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|A\n| bgcolor=\"yellow\" |SF\n| bgcolor=\"yellow\" |SF\n| bgcolor=\"ffebcd\" |QF\n| bgcolor=\"ffebcd\" |QF\n|-\n|D\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Olympic Games\n|S\n| colspan=\"3\" |Not Held\n|A\n| colspan=\"3\" |Not Held\n|A\n| colspan=\"2\" |Not Held\n|-\n|T\n| colspan=\"3\" |Not Held\n|A\n| colspan=\"3\" |Not Held\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n| colspan=\"2\" |Not Held\n|}\nSenior career highlights, as of April 2018:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://results.ittf.link/index.php?option=com_fabrik&view=list&listid=36&Itemid=158|title=ITTF Player Matches / Tomokazu Harimoto|website=ITTF|accessdate=9 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n;Singles<ref name=\"ITTF statistics\">[http://ittfstats.alfaweb.gr/index.php?option=com_fabrik&view=list&listid=36&Itemid=158 ITTF Statistics.] International Table Tennis Federation.</ref>\n*[[World Table Tennis Championships|World Championships]]: SF (2013, 2017).\n*[[Table Tennis World Cup|World Cup]] appearances: 3.

by the [[International Table Tennis Federation]] (ITTF), as of March 2020. He first reached his career-high singles ranking of world No. 1 in January 2013.\n\nHe has won 17 World Tour Singles titles and has won the World Championships in men's doubles 3 times, mixed doubles 2 times, and fives times in the team event. In addition, Xu Xin along with Ma Long and Zhang Jike won the [[Table tennis at the 2016 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's team|men's team]] title at the [[2016 Summer Olympics]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]].\n\n==Playing style and equipment==\n[[File:Xu Xin 2012.jpg|thumb|left|235px|Xu Xin in the men's final of the Qatar Open 2012]]\nXu Xin is a Stiga sponsored athlete. He uses a Stiga Dynasty Carbon as his blade, with DHS TG2 Skyline national version for his forehand and DHS NEO Hurricane 3 custom sponge on his backhand (37degrees hardness). \n\nXu Xin is one of the few penhold grip players in China, especially among the younger generation who are mostly shakehand players. He follows the footsteps of other penhold champions such as [[Wang Hao (table tennis, born 1983)|Wang Hao]] and [[Ma Lin (table tennis)|Ma Lin]].\n\nWith his long arms and frame, he is able to more easily reach balls hit wide. His long arms enable a graceful, unique forehand loop, with his arm almost fully outstretched. He has also adopted the reverse penhold backhand grip (RPB), a recent development for China's penholders, allowing a two-winged attack. He still uses a traditional penhold backhand to lob and push the ball with the forehand side of his racket. More recently, Xu Xin has been more willing to counter with his RPB, allowing him to maintain aggression in the points on his backhand side.\n\nXu Xin's main strength is his shot variation and blazing forehand loops, often stepping very deep into his backhand corner to use his forehand. He sets these shots up with his extremely spinny and deceptive serves, and has some of the best footwork in table tennis. He is also something of a 'crowd entertainer\u2019, often coming up with wild, and sometimes inappropriate, shots. He has been dubbed the 'show man' in recent years. This is perhaps due to his playful nature and confidence in playing. He admitted that he hopes to try to be more efficient and effective with his shot selection as he matures and carries more responsibilities. More recently, Xu Xin has been called \"XUperman\", referring to his many \"superman-like\" moments. These names have been widely popularized by the use of Adam Bobrow, an ITTF commentator.\n\n==Career==\n===2013===\nIn January 2013, he reached the No. 1 spot in the World Rankings thanks to the points obtained by winning the ITTF World Tour Grand Finals in December 2012.\n\n===2014===\nIn January 2014, Xu Xin defended his title by beating world No. 1 ranked [[Ma Long (table tennis)|Ma Long]] in the finals match of the 2013 ITTF World Tour Grand Finals held in Dubai.\n\n===2016===\nIn 2016, Xu Xin defeated world No. 1 ranked and current World Champion Ma Long 4\u20132 in the semi-finals match of the 2016 Japan Open, but then was beaten by world No. 2 ranked [[Fan Zhendong]] in the finals. One week later after the Japan Open, Xu Xin won his third Korea Open title after beating [[Ma Long (table tennis)|Ma Long]] again 4\u20133 in the finals.<ref>http://www.ittf.com/_front_page/ittf_full_story1.asp?ID=44790&Competition_ID=2663&</ref><ref>http://www.ittf.com/_front_page/ittf_full_story1.asp?ID=44896&Competition_ID=2664&</ref>\n\nHowever, he was deemed not good enough to be entered into the singles tournament of the [[Rio 2016 Summer Olympics]].\n\n===2017===\nIn late 2017, he had a disappointing German Open, where in doubles Xu and his partner Fan Zhendong were knocked out in the Round of 16, and lost in the Quarterfinals to Lee Sangsu 4\u20130 in the singles event. In the Swedish Open, he won the doubles event with Fan Zhendong, before defeating Fan, the world No. 2, 4\u20131 one hour later in the Men's Singles event. At the [[2017 ITTF World Tour Grand Finals]], Xu Xin was seeded 5th and lost to 3rd seed Fan Zhendong in the quarter-finals.\n\n===2018===\nXu Xin started his 2018 year by participating with teammates [[Ma Long (table tennis)|Ma Long]], [[Fan Zhendong]], [[Lin Gaoyuan]] and [[Yu Ziyang]] in the [[2018 ITTF Team World Cup \u2013 Men's team|2018 ITTF Team World Cup]], beating Japan in the final. During the tournament, Xu only dropped one set.\n\nXu Xin entered one of the six platinum events of the tour, the [[2018 Qatar Open (table tennis)|Qatar Open,]] seeking an unprecedented fourth title. He almost suffered a defeat to Zhou Yu winning 4\u20133, but he was beaten by Fan Zhendong in the semi-finals 4\u20131. The following day, Xu Xin along with Fan Zhendong beat Jun Mizutani and Yuya Oshima to claim the men's doubles title. One week later at the [[2018 German Open (table tennis)|German Open]], Xu was seeded third but lost to fifth seeded Ma Long in the final. Xu Xin partnered Ma Long to claim his second doubles title of the year defeating [[Lee Sang-su]] and [[Jeoung Young-sik|Jeong Young-sik]] in the final.\n\nThe next month, Xu Xin was a part of the winning team China at the [[2018 World Team Table Tennis Championships]] in his tenth appearance at the World Championships. Xu earned the final point for team China during the final, beating [[Patrick Franziska]] 3\u20131 for China to claim the title with a 3\u20130 win over Germany.\n\nAt the China Open, Xu Xin was looking for his first World Tour title of the year. However, his ambitions were stopped in his home country by Lim Jong-hoon in the Round of 32. At the next World Tour platinum event, the [[2018 Korea Open (table tennis)|Korea Open]], Xu Xin was seeded 3rd but lost in the Round of 16 to [[Jang Woo-jin]].\n\nLooking to redeem himself, Xu Xin claimed the title at the [[2018 Australian Open (table tennis)|Australian Open]] beating qualifier [[Liu Dingshuo]] in the final, Xu Xin's first World Tour title of the year. Right after that, Xu Xin claimed another title at the [[2018 Bulgaria Open (table tennis)|Bulgaria Open]] beating Japan's [[Kenta Matsudaira]] in the final. Xu Xin claimed his third men's doubles titles with Ma Long at the Bulgarian Open, their second title as a pair in 2018.\n\nBecause of his lack of participation in the [[Asian Cup Table Tennis Tournament|Asian Cup]] earlier that year, Xu Xin did not participate in the [[2018 ITTF Men's World Cup]].\n\nAt the [[2018 Swedish Open (table tennis)|Swedish Open]], Xu Xin was looking to defend his title, but lost to top seed Fan Zhendong in the final. Two days later at the [[2018 Austrian Open (table tennis)|Austrian Open]], Xu Xin lost in the final to qualifier Liang Jingkun 4\u20133 after Liang Jingkun had stunningly beat Fan Zhendong 4\u20132 in the semi-finals. Xu also claimed his first mixed doubles title ever at the Austrian Open, winning with Liu Shiwen over [[Cheng I-ching|Cheng-I-Ching]] and [[Chen Chien-an]] in the final.\n\nDue to Xu's appearance in five finals and claiming two of the titles, Xu Xin was seeded first in the [[2018 ITTF World Tour Grand Finals]], followed closely by Fan Zhendong, Ma Long, and Liang Jingkun. Xu Xin lost to compatriot Lin Gaoyuan in the quarter-finals, 4-2. \n\n=== 2019 ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2019}}\nXu Xin started off the year at the [[2019 Hungarian Open (table tennis)|2019 Hungarian Open]] where he reached the semi-finals. Xu Xin lost to the eventual champion [[Lin Gaoyuan]].\n\nAt the [[2019 Qatar Open (table tennis)|Qatar Open]], Xu Xin faced off against his old rival [[Ma Long (table tennis)|Ma Long]] in the semi-final stage. Ma Long had just returned from injury and was making his first appearance on the ITTF World Tour since many months before. In a highly anticipated match, Xu Xin eventually lost to eventual champion Ma Long, where he beat Lin Gaoyuan in the finals. \n\nHeading in as the number 2 seed at the [[2019 World Table Tennis Championships|2019 ITTF World Table Tennis Championships]], Xu Xin was looking to prove himself during this competition. He participated in the men's singles and mixed doubles with [[Liu Shiwen]]. After the draw was made, Xu Xin was the only Chinese player in the bottom half of the draw. Because of the seedings, #1 [[Fan Zhendong]], #3 [[Lin Gaoyuan]], #9 [[Liang Jingkun]], and #11 [[Ma Long (table tennis)|Ma Long]] were all drawn in the top half of the draw. Much pressure was placed on Xu to help achieve an all Chinese final, but was also a large opportunity for Xu Xin to perform well at a World Championships. Xu Xin won his first round 4-1 against Jan Zibrat and his second round 4-0 over Austria's Stefan Fegerl. However, Xu's road to the final was stopped by Frenchman [[Simon Gauzy]] 4-2. Gauzy outperformed Xu and Gauzy is even said to have \"outspinned the spin master\". Xu's shocking defeat meant that for the first time in over 15 years, there would not be an all Chinese final. The last time this happened was at the [[2003 World Table Tennis Championships|2003 World Championships]], where Austria's [[Werner Schlager]] faced off against [[Joo Sae-hyuk|Joo Saehyuk]] in the men's final. In the mixed doubles event, Xu did not falter, where Xu Xin and Liu Shiwen claimed victory 4-1 over [[Kasumi Ishikawa]] and [[Maharu Yoshimura]].\n\nAt the [[2019 Japan Open (table tennis)|2019 Japan Open]], Xu Xin became the second person in history to achieve a coveted \"triple crown\", the first being Jang Woojin at the 2018 Korea Open. Xu Xin claimed the champion in singles, men's doubles, and mixed doubles. In the men's singles final, Xu Xin defeated [[Lin Yun-ju]], \"the silent assassin\", in a highly anticipated final. Xu Xin claimed doubles titles with Fan Zhendong and [[Zhu Yuling]].\n\nXu Xin's performance at the Japan Open was enough to place him again at number one in the world, a position that he last held in early 2015. He replaced Fan Zhendong from the position, who had previously held the spot for over a year. Fan Zhendong dropped to #3 in the world rankings.\n\nThe following week at the [[Korea Open (table tennis)|Korea Open]], Xu Xin once again claimed the singles title in the final, defeating his good-friend Ma Long in the final. Coming into the final, Xu Xin had lost his six previous encounters against Ma Long on the international stage, and Ma was heavily regarded as the favorite to win. After an amazing match, Xu Xin said that \"Winning the title is not the reason I am feeling so happy. It\u2019s because I beat Ma Long\", paying homage to Ma Long's dominance over the past years. Xu Xin again won the men's doubles title with Fan Zhendong, but in the mixed doubles Xu Xin and [[Liu Shiwen]] were defeated by [[Wong Chun Ting]] and [[Doo Hoi Kem]] at the final stage. This marked the first ever loss for the pairing of Xu Xin and Liu Shiwen, recent mixed doubles world champions at the [[2019 World Table Tennis Championships \u2013 Mixed Doubles|2019 ITTF World Table Tennis Championships]].\n\nThe next week at the [[Australian Open (table tennis)|Australian Open]], Xu Xin claimed three men's singles championships in a row on the [[ITTF World Tour]], and became the first person to successfully defend a men's singles title at the Australian Open. Xu Xin beat his colleague [[Wang Chuqin]] in the final 4-0; Wang Chuqin had defeated Ma Long at the semi-final stage.\n\nAfter the Australian Open, the first of the T2 Events were played in Malaysia. In this tournament, Xu Xin showed signs of slowness and tiredness, proposed to be due to the many weeks of play on the world tour. Xu Xin made it to the semi-finals, where he lost to Fan Zhendong 4-0 in a rematch of their semi-final match at the Japan Open earlier this year, where Xu won 4-3.\n\nMany of the Chinese players have vocalized their dislike of many ITTF events being played one after the other, with no real breaks in between. After the final in Australia, Xu Xin responded \"too tired\". Ma Long and other Chinese players also said the same, but it is said that competitions must be played in order to maintain higher world rankings for the Chinese players, all in preparation for Tokyo 2020. \n\nAt the [[Chinese National Championships (table tennis)|2019 Chinese National Championships]], Xu Xin and four of his other prominent colleagues, [[Ma Long (table tennis)|Ma Long]], [[Fan Zhendong]], [[Liu Shiwen]], and [[Ding Ning]] all pulled out of the competition. Their reasoning was for them to rest up after they had just played several events back to back on the ITTF World Tour.\n\nXu Xin ended the year as the World No. 1.\n\nDue to his outstanding performances and showman-like qualities, Xu Xin gained the nickname of \"XUperman\", holding true to his superhuman play. This nickname is one of Xu Xin's many, the others being the Showman and the Cloudwalker, all descriptive of his playing style.\n\n==Career statistics==\n[[File:ITTF World Tour 2017 German Open Xu Xin 05.jpg|thumb|235px|ITTF World Tour 2017 German Open|alt=]]\n\n===ITTF Major tournament performance timeline===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Key\n| style=\"background:lime;\" |W\n| style=\"background:thistle;\" |F\n| bgcolor=\"yellow\" |SF\n| bgcolor=\"ffebcd\" |QF\n| bgcolor=\"afeeee\" |#R\n| bgcolor=\"afeeee\" |RR\n|A\n|NH\n|}\n<small>(W) Won; (F) finalist; (SF) semi-finalist; (QF) quarterfinalist; (#R) rounds 4, 3, 2, 1; (RR) round-robin stage; (A) Absent; (NH) Not Held; (S) Singles Tournament; (D) Doubles Tournament; (XD) Mixed Doubles Tournament; (T) Team Tournament.</small>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align::center; font-size: small;\"\n! colspan=\"2\" |Tournament\n!2009\n!2010\n!2011\n!2012\n!2013\n!2014\n!2015\n!2016\n!2017\n!2018\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |World Cup\n|S\n|A\n|A\n|A\n| bgcolor=\"yellow\" |SF\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|A\n|A\n| style=\"background:thistle;\"|F\n|A\n|A\n|-\n|T\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|NH\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" |World Championships\n|S\n| bgcolor=\"afeeee\"|3R\n|NH\n| bgcolor=\"afeeee\"|4R\n|NH\n| bgcolor=\"yellow\" |SF\n|NH\n| bgcolor=\"afeeee\"|4R\n|NH\n| bgcolor=\"yellow\" |SF\n|NH\n|-\n|T\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|-\n|D\n| style=\"background:thistle;\"|F\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|NH\n|A\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|NH\n|-\n|XD\n| bgcolor=\"ffebcd\"|QF\n|NH\n|A\n|NH\n|A\n|NH\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|NH\n|A\n|NH\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |World Tour Grand Finals\n|S\n| style=\"background:thistle;\"|F\n| style=\"background:thistle;\"|F\n|A\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n|A\n| bgcolor=\"yellow\" |SF\n| bgcolor=\"yellow\" |SF\n| bgcolor=\"ffebcd\" |QF\n| bgcolor=\"ffebcd\" |QF\n|-\n|D\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Olympic Games\n|S\n| colspan=\"3\" |Not Held\n|A\n| colspan=\"3\" |Not Held\n|A\n| colspan=\"2\" |Not Held\n|-\n|T\n| colspan=\"3\" |Not Held\n|A\n| colspan=\"3\" |Not Held\n| style=\"background:lime;\"|W\n| colspan=\"2\" |Not Held\n|}\nSenior career highlights, as of April 2018:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://results.ittf.link/index.php?option=com_fabrik&view=list&listid=36&Itemid=158|title=ITTF Player Matches / Tomokazu Harimoto|website=ITTF|accessdate=9 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n;Singles<ref name=\"ITTF statistics\">[http://ittfstats.alfaweb.gr/index.php?option=com_fabrik&view=list&listid=36&Itemid=158 ITTF Statistics.] International Table Tennis Federation.</ref>\n*[[World Table Tennis Championships|World Championships]]: SF (2013, 2017).\n*[[Table Tennis World Cup|World Cup]] appearances: 3.

As the outbreak and pandemic spread, several keystone trade events, including [[E3 2020]], were cancelled over concerns of further spread. The economic impact on the video game sector is not expected to be as large as in film or other entertainment sectors as much of the work in video game production can be decentralised and performed remotely, and products distributed digitally to consumers regardless of various national and regional lockdowns on businesses and services.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://time.com/5793862/coronavirus-video-games/ | title = 'This Is Quite a Blow.'

Originally developing in the 1920s, the movement was supportive of the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] but not its stated goals of enacting [[communism]], seeing the [[Soviet Union]] as a stepping stone on the path to creating a new national identity that would reflect the unique character of Russia's geopolitical position. The movement saw a minor resurgence after the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] at the end of the 20th century, and is mirrored by [[Turanism]] in [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] and [[Baltic Finnic peoples|Finnic]] nations.\n\n==Early 20th century==\n{{See also|Nomad studies}}\n\n[[File:Sovetskogo Soyuzsa or suggested unitary RSFSR plus non-Alaska territory (1866) and near abroad.png|thumb|Orthographic projection of Greater Russia/Eurasia and near abroad\n{{Legend|#673334|The [[Soviet Union]] in 1945}}\n{{space|3}}{{Legend inline|#800000|(Soviet territories that were never part of the [[Russian Empire]]: [[Tuvan ASSR]], [[Kaliningrad Oblast]] and [[Zakarpattia Oblast|Zakarpattia]], [[Lviv Oblast|Lviv]], [[Stanislav Oblast|Stanislav]] and [[Ternopil Oblast|Ternopil]] regions in west [[Ukraine]])}}\n{{Legend|#B31B1B|Additional annexed/occupied territory from the Russian Empire ([[Grand Duchy of Finland]] and [[Congress Poland]])}}\n{{Legend|#FF0000|Maximum extent of the Soviet near abroad, 1955 ([[Warsaw Pact]], [[Mongolian People's Republic]] and [[North Korea]])}}\n{{Legend|#ED2939|Maximum extent of the Soviet Union's sphere of influence, 1945\u20131946 ([[Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran|Northern Iran]], [[Soviet invasion of Xinjiang|Xinjiang]], [[Soviet occupation of Manchuria|Manchuria]])}}]]\n\nEurasianism is a political movement that has its origins in the [[White \u00e9migr\u00e9|Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9]] community in the 1920s. The movement posited that Russian civilization does not belong in the \"European\" category (somewhat borrowing from [[Slavophile]] ideas of [[Konstantin Leontyev]]), and that the [[October Revolution]] of the [[Bolshevik]]s was a necessary reaction to the rapid modernization of Russian society. The Eurasianists believed that the Soviet regime was capable of evolving into a new national, non-European [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]] government, shedding the initial mask of [[proletarian internationalism]] and [[Antitheism|militant atheism]] (to which the Eurasianists were strongly opposed).{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n\nThe Eurasianists criticized the anti-Bolshevik activities of organizations such as [[Russian All-Military Union|ROVS]], believing that the \u00e9migr\u00e9 community's energies would be better focused on preparing for this hoped for process of evolution. In turn, their opponents among the emigres argued that the Eurasianists were calling for a compromise with and even support of the Soviet regime, while justifying its ruthless policies (such as the [[Persecution of Christians in the Soviet Union|persecution]] of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]) as mere \"transitory problems\" that were inevitable results of the revolutionary process.\n\nThe key leaders of the Eurasianists were Prince [[Nikolai Trubetzkoy]], P.N. Savitsky, P.P. Suvchinskiy, [[D. S. Mirsky]], [[Konstantin Chkheidze|K. \u010ccheidze]], P. Arapov, and S. Efron. Philosopher [[Georges Florovsky]] was initially a supporter, but backed out of the organization claiming it \"raises the right questions\", but \"poses the wrong answers\". A significant influence of the doctrine of the Eurasianists can be found in [[Nikolai Berdyaev]]'s essay ''The Sources and Meaning of Russian Communism''.\n\nSeveral organizations similar in spirit to the Eurasianists sprung up in the emigre community at around the same time, such as the pro-Monarchist [[Mladorossi]] and the [[Smenovekhovtsy|Smenovekhovtsi]].\n\nSeveral members of the Eurasianists were affected by the Soviet provocational [[Trust Operation|TREST]] operation, which had set up a fake meeting of Eurasianists in Russia that was attended by the Eurasianist leader P.N. Savitsky in 1926 (an earlier series of trips were also made two years earlier by Eurasianist member P. Arapov). The uncovering of the TREST as a Soviet provocation caused a serious morale blow to the Eurasianists and discredited their public image. By 1929, the Eurasianists had ceased publishing their periodical and had faded quickly from the Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 community.{{cn|date=May 2019}}\n\n==\"Greater\" Russia==\n{{distinguish|Great Russia}}\n[[File:Growth of Russia 1613-1914.png|thumb|[[Russia]] growth 1613\u20131914]]\n\nThe political-cultural concept espoused by some in [[Russia]] is sometimes called the Greater Russia and is described as a political aspiration of pan-[[Russia]]n [[nationalist]]s and [[irredentist]]s to retake some or all of the territories of the other republics of the former [[Soviet Union]] and territory of the former [[Russian Empire]] not to mention the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]] and amalgamate them into a single Russian state.

[[Lev Gumilev]] is often cited as the founder of the Neo-Eurasianist movement, and he was quoted as saying that \"I am the last of the ''Eurasianists''.\"<ref name=\"Laruelle\">Laruelle, Marl\u00e8ne \"Histoire d'une usurpation intellectuelle: Gumilev, 'le dernier des eurasistes'?

At any rate, Gumilev's work has been a source of inspiration for the Neo-Eurasianist authors, of whom [[Aleksandr Dugin]] has the highest profile.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Political scientist [[Anton Shekhovtsov]] defines Dugin's version of Neo-Eurasianism as \"a form of a fascist ideology centred on the idea of revolutionising the Russian society and building a totalitarian, Russia-dominated Eurasian Empire that would challenge and eventually defeat its eternal adversary represented by the United States and its Atlanticist allies, thus bringing about a new \u2018golden age\u2019 of global political and cultural [[illiberalism]]\".<ref>Shekhovtsov, Anton (2018) ''Russia and the Western Far Right'': ''Tango Noir'', Abingdon, Routledge, p. 43.</ref>\n\nGumilev's contribution to Neo-Eurasianism lies in the conclusions he reaches from applying his theory of ethnogenesis: that  the Mongol occupation of 1240\u20131480 AD (known as the \"[[Mongol yoke]]\") had shielded the emergent Russian ethnos from the aggressive neighbor to the West,{{who?|date=September 2019}} allowing it to gain time to achieve maturity. The idea of Eurasianism contrasts with [[Konstantin Leontyev]]'s ''[[Byzantism]]'', which is similar in its rejection of the West, but identifies with the [[Byzantine Empire]] rather than with Central Asian tribal culture.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n===Early 21st century Russian political party===\n{{See also|Foundations of Geopolitics}}\n[[File:Eurasia and eurasianism.png|thumb|Eurasian world for eurasianist political movement]]\nThe ideology of the movement was partially incorporated into a new movement of the same name after the 1991 [[fall of the Soviet Union]], influenced the political theorist [[Aleksandr Dugin]] to publish in 1997 a ''magnum opus'' by the name of ''[[Foundations of Geopolitics]]''.

Originally developing in the 1920s, the movement was supportive of the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] but not its stated goals of enacting [[communism]], seeing the [[Soviet Union]] as a stepping stone on the path to creating a new national identity that would reflect the unique character of Russia's geopolitical position. The movement saw a minor resurgence after the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] at the end of the 20th century, and is mirrored by [[Turanism]] in [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] and [[Baltic Finnic peoples|Finnic]] nations.\n\n==Early 20th century==\n{{see also|Nomad studies}}\n[[File:Sovetskogo Soyuzsa or suggested unitary RSFSR plus non-Alaska territory (1866) and near abroad.png|thumb|Orthographic projection of Greater Russia/Eurasia and near abroad\n{{Legend|#673334|The [[Soviet Union]] in 1945}}\n{{space|3}}{{Legend inline|#800000|(Soviet territories that were never part of the [[Russian Empire]]: [[Tuvan ASSR]], [[Kaliningrad Oblast]] and [[Zakarpattia Oblast|Zakarpattia]], [[Lviv Oblast|Lviv]], [[Stanislav Oblast|Stanislav]] and [[Ternopil Oblast|Ternopil]] regions in west [[Ukraine]])}}\n{{Legend|#B31B1B|Additional annexed/occupied territory from the Russian Empire ([[Grand Duchy of Finland]] and [[Congress Poland]])}}\n{{Legend|#FF0000|Maximum extent of the Soviet near abroad, 1955 ([[Warsaw Pact]], [[Mongolian People's Republic]] and [[North Korea]])}}\n{{Legend|#ED2939|Maximum extent of the Soviet Union's sphere of influence, 1945\u20131946 ([[Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran|Northern Iran]], [[Soviet invasion of Xinjiang|Xinjiang]], [[Soviet occupation of Manchuria|Manchuria]])}}]]\n\nEurasianism is a political movement that has its origins in the [[White \u00e9migr\u00e9|Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9]] community in the 1920s. The movement posited that Russian civilization does not belong in the \"European\" category (somewhat borrowing from [[Slavophile]] ideas of [[Konstantin Leontyev]]), and that the [[October Revolution]] of the [[Bolshevik]]s was a necessary reaction to the rapid modernization of Russian society. The Eurasianists believed that the Soviet regime was capable of evolving into a new national, non-European [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]] government, shedding the initial mask of [[proletarian internationalism]] and [[Antitheism|militant atheism]] (to which the Eurasianists were strongly opposed).{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n\nThe Eurasianists criticized the anti-Bolshevik activities of organizations such as [[Russian All-Military Union|ROVS]], believing that the \u00e9migr\u00e9 community's energies would be better focused on preparing for this hoped for process of evolution. In turn, their opponents among the emigres argued that the Eurasianists were calling for a compromise with and even support of the Soviet regime, while justifying its ruthless policies (such as the [[Persecution of Christians in the Soviet Union|persecution]] of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]) as mere \"transitory problems\" that were inevitable results of the revolutionary process.\n\nThe key leaders of the Eurasianists were Prince [[Nikolai Trubetzkoy]], P.N. Savitsky, P.P. Suvchinskiy, [[D. S. Mirsky]], [[Konstantin Chkheidze|K. \u010ccheidze]], P. Arapov, and S. Efron. Philosopher [[Georges Florovsky]] was initially a supporter, but backed out of the organization claiming it \"raises the right questions\", but \"poses the wrong answers\". A significant influence of the doctrine of the Eurasianists can be found in [[Nikolai Berdyaev]]'s essay ''The Sources and Meaning of Russian Communism''.\n\nSeveral organizations similar in spirit to the Eurasianists sprung up in the emigre community at around the same time, such as the pro-Monarchist [[Mladorossi]] and the [[Smenovekhovtsy|Smenovekhovtsi]].\n\nSeveral members of the Eurasianists were affected by the Soviet provocational [[Trust Operation|TREST]] operation, which had set up a fake meeting of Eurasianists in Russia that was attended by the Eurasianist leader P.N. Savitsky in 1926 (an earlier series of trips were also made two years earlier by Eurasianist member P. Arapov). The uncovering of the TREST as a Soviet provocation caused a serious morale blow to the Eurasianists and discredited their public image. By 1929, the Eurasianists had ceased publishing their periodical and had faded quickly from the Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 community.{{cn|date=May 2019}}\n\n==\"Greater\" Russia==\n{{distinguish|Great Russia}}\n[[File:Growth of Russia 1613-1914.png|thumb|[[Russia]] growth 1613\u20131914]]\n\nThe political-cultural concept espoused by some in [[Russia]] is sometimes called the Greater Russia and is described as a political aspiration of pan-[[Russia]]n [[nationalist]]s and [[irredentist]]s to retake some or all of the territories of the other republics of the former [[Soviet Union]] and territory of the former [[Russian Empire]] not to mention the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]] and amalgamate them into a single Russian state.

At any rate, Gumilev's work has been a source of inspiration for the Neo-Eurasianist authors, of whom [[Aleksandr Dugin]] has the highest profile.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Political scientist [[Anton Shekhovtsov]] defines Dugin's version of Neo-Eurasianism as \"a form of a fascist ideology centred on the idea of revolutionising the Russian society and building a totalitarian, Russia-dominated Eurasian Empire that would challenge and eventually defeat its eternal adversary represented by the United States and its Atlanticist allies, thus bringing about a new \u2018golden age\u2019 of global political and cultural [[illiberalism]]\".<ref>Shekhovtsov, Anton (2018) ''Russia and the Western Far Right'': ''Tango Noir'', Abingdon, Routledge, p. 43.</ref>\n\nGumilev's contribution to Neo-Eurasianism lies in the conclusions he reaches from applying his theory of ethnogenesis: that  the Mongol occupation of 1240\u20131480 AD (known as the \"[[Mongol yoke]]\") had shielded the emergent Russian ethnos from the aggressive neighbor to the West,{{who?|date=September 2019}} allowing it to gain time to achieve maturity. The idea of Eurasianism contrasts with [[Konstantin Leontyev]]'s ''[[Byzantism]]'', which is similar in its rejection of the West, but identifies with the [[Byzantine Empire]] rather than with Central Asian tribal culture.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n===Early 21st century Russian political party===\n{{See also|Foundations of Geopolitics}}\n[[File:Eurasia and eurasianism.png|thumb|Eurasian world for eurasianist political movement]]\nThe ideology of the movement was partially incorporated into a new movement of the same name after the 1991 [[fall of the Soviet Union]], influenced the political theorist [[Aleksandr Dugin]] to publish in 1997 a ''magnum opus'' by the name of ''[[Foundations of Geopolitics]]''.

McCovey becomes the second player, after [[Ted Williams]] (who also retired with 521 career home runs), to hit a home run in four different decades.\n** [[Ferguson Jenkins]] becomes the fifth pitcher in major league history to win 100 games in both the NL and AL when he gets the decision in a 3\u20132 win over the Baltimore Orioles.

Jenkins pitched a complete game for the Rangers, striking out eight batters in the victory.\n** In the early hours of the morning, the MLBPA and the owners reach a preliminary agreement, preventing a walk out by the players.

He hits two home runs off [[Randy Jones (baseball)|Randy Jones]] in the Reds' 5\u20133 victory over the [[San Diego Padres]]; the first comes in the second inning and gives him 336 on his career and 306 as a catcher, breaking a tie he had shared with Berra.\n\n===June===\n*June 3 - The June MLB player draft is held. Notable selections in the first round are [[Kelly Gruber]], who'd go on to win a gold glove with the [[Toronto Blue Jays]], who is drafted by the Cleveland Indians, the [[Montreal Expos]] take first baseman [[Terry Francona]] with the 22nd pick, and [[Darryl Strawberry]] by the New York Mets.\n*June 4 - [[Jim Kaat]], recently acquired by the St. Louis Cardinals from the New York Yankees, pitches 10 shut out innings against the New York Mets.

Ger\u00f3nimo was also [[Bob Gibson]]'s 3,000th career strikeout victim six years earlier. Despite the milestone, Ryan allows six runs in 4.1 innings and Houston loses, 8\u20131.\n**During the first-ever fireworks night hosted at [[Shea Stadium]], [[Montreal Expos]] Rookie [[Bill Gullickson]] sailed a pitch over [[New York Mets]] [[first baseman]] [[Mike Jorgensen]]'s head in the second game of a [[Doubleheader (baseball)|doubleheader]]. Jorgensen did not appreciate this as he had been the victim of one of the worst [[beanball]] injuries in baseball history the previous season with the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]], and motioned toward Gullickson his disapproval. Mets [[catcher]] [[John Stearns]], who was not even in the line-up for this game, charged out of the dugout and welcomed Gullickson to the majors by slamming him to the ground.\n*July 6 \u2013 [[Philadelphia Phillies]] pitcher [[Steve Carlton]] becomes the major leagues' left-handed strikeout king, fanning seven [[St. Louis Cardinals|Cardinals]] in an 8\u20133 Phillies win to bring his career total to 2,836.

Richard]] suffers a stroke during his first attempt to pitch since being hospitalized for tests weeks earlier.  He would not play again.\n\n===August===\n*August 1 - The New York Yankees sign 15 year old pitching prospect [[Jose Rijo]] as an undrafted amateur free agent. \n*August 4 - The [[Seattle Mariners]] fired manager Farrell Johnson, and replace him with [[Maury Wills]]. This is the first managerial change in franchise history for the Mariners\n*August 5 - [[Chicago Cubs]] rookie shortstop [[Steve Macko]] suffers a bad bruise in a collision with the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]]' [[Bill Madlock]] in the first game of a doubleheader.

Doctors examining Macko diagnose him with [[testicular cancer]], and Macko would pass away in November 1981.\n*August 11 - [[Reggie Jackson]] of the New York Yankees hits his 400th career home run of [[Britt Burns]] of the Chicago White Sox. \n** The [[Kansas City Royals]] sign pitcher [[Ken Brett]], re-uniting him with his brother, Royals Third baseman [[George Brett]].\n*August 12 - Nearly 50,000 fans cram into Tiger Stadium to watch former Tigers ace [[Mark Fidrych]] attempt a comeback. Boston won the game 5\u20132, and Fidrych's days in the majors begin to come to an end. \n*August 17 - The Detroit Tigers hold a ceremony in which they retire the number 6 in honor of former star [[Al Kaline]]. Kaline becomes the first player in Tigers history to have his uniform number retired. \n*August 20 - Chicago White Sox outfielder [[Leo Sutherland]] gets a single off Indians pitcher [[Dan Spillner]]. The hit breaks up Spilner's no-hit bid. He then retires the next two batters as Cleveland gets the 3\u20130 victory. \n*August 21 - Oakland A's owner Charlie Finley announces the sale of the team to Walter Haas, Jr, a move that assures the team will stay in Oakland. Oil tycoon Marvin Davis had wanted to purchase the team and move then to Denver Colorado. \n*August 24 - [[Gene Mauch]] resigns as mananger of the [[Minnesota Twins]] and third base coach [[John Goryl]] takes over.

Pawtucket is playing the [[Toledo Mud Hens]], who force Boggs' last at-bat by walking the light hitting [[Ray Boyer]]. The Mud Hens, who led the game 6\u20130, allow Boyer to take bases at will. Boggs ends up grounding out to first to end the game, thus lowering his average. He finished the season .0007 points behind [[Dave Engle]], who just happened to play for the Toledo Mud Hens. \n** [[Ed Farmer]], who'd been assaulted during a game by [[Al Cowens]] earlier in the season, agrees to drop the charges. Before the game, both men brought the line-up cards to the home plate umpire, and later shook hands. The fans weren't as forgiving, as they booed Cowens every time he came to bat.\n*September 8 - Commissioner [[Bowie Kuhn]] suspends pitcher [[Ferguson Jenkins]] following Jenkins' drug arrest. An Arbiter later re-instates Jenkins. \n** The [[Philadelphia Phillies]] sign free agent catcher [[Tim McCarver]] in what would be McCarver's final season as a pro. \n*September 10 \u2013 [[Bill Gullickson]] strikes out 18, the most by a major league rookie pitcher, as the [[Montr\u00e9al Expos]] beat the [[Chicago Cubs]] 4\u20132.\n*September 13 - The Texas Rangers trade pitcher [[Sparky Lyle]] to the Philadelphia Phillies for a player named later.

George Brett gets two hits to keep his average above .400, marking the latest in a season that a player was hitting at or above .400 since [[Ted Williams]] in 1941.\n*September 20 \u2013 [[George Brett]] goes 0-for-4 dropping his [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] below .400. It will not climb above .400 again, and he finishes the season with a .390 [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]], the closest any player had come to a .400 batting average since [[Ted Williams]] in {{Baseball year|1941}}.  Only [[Tony Gwynn]] will come closer than that before the 20th century ends.\n** A bronze plaque dedicated to [[Thurman Munson]], who died unexpectedly the previous season in a plane crash, is unveiled in the team's monument park.\n*September 24 \u2013 The [[Atlanta Braves]] reach the 1,000,000 mark in attendance.

[[Ozzie Smith]] and [[Jerry Mumphrey]] each steal a base, making the Padres the first team ever with three players who stole more than 5 bases. Gene Richard, who lead the team with 61 swipes, was the other. \n** [[Brian Kingman]] of the Oakland A's loses his 20th game of the season. The loss made Kingman the first 20-game loser in the majors since [[Dolf Luque]] of the Cincinnati reds in 1922.  \n*September 28 - Before an [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] National television audience, the Montreal Expos beat the Philadelphia Phillies, 8\u20133 to take a half-game lead in the National League East. [[Steve Rogers (baseball)|Steve Rogers]] picked up his 16th win of the season while [[Gary Carter]] was the offensive hero for the Expos as he went 3-for-4 including 2 home runs. His great day would put him on the cover of [[Sports Illustrated]] the following week.\n*September 30 - The New York Mets defeat the Pittsburgh Pirates 3\u20132 at Shea Stadium. Only 1,754 fans showed up, making it the smallest crowd to ever attend a game at Shea.\n\n===October===\n*October 1 - The Boston Red Sox fire manager [[Don Zimmer]] due to pressure from fans, who never forgave Zimmer for the late season collapse in 1978, who led to the one game play off oin which [[Bucky Dent]] hot the game-winning home run for the Yankees over the green monster.\n*October 4 \u2013 In a 17\u20131 rout of the [[Minnesota Twins]], [[Willie Wilson (baseball)|Willie Wilson]] of the [[Kansas City Royals]] becomes the first major league player ever to be credited with 700 at-bats in a single season, and ends the year with 705 at bats. He also sets the [[American League|AL]] record for singles in a season with 184, eclipsing the mark [[Sam Rice]] set in {{Baseball year|1925}}. Wilson also becomes only the second player in major league history to collect 100 hits from each side of the plate, matching the feat accomplished by [[Garry Templeton]] in {{Baseball year|1979}}.\n*October 4 \u2013 Philadelphia's [[Mike Schmidt]] hits a 2-run home run in the top of the 11th inning to give the Phillies a 6\u20134 win over the [[Montreal Expos]] at [[Olympic Stadium (Montreal)|Olympic Stadium]], clinching the National League East title. The home run is Schmidt's 48th of the season, breaking [[Eddie Mathews]]' single-season record for third basemen set in {{Baseball year|1953}}.\n*October 5 \u2013 On October 3, the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] had been down three games to the [[Houston Astros]] to tie for the [[National League West Division]] title.  Needing a sweep of the Astros, the Dodgers complete just such a sweep today;  each of the wins by a single run.  They will play a one-game playoff tomorrow.\n** [[Ben Oglivie]], who was born in [[Panama]],  of the Milwaukee Brewers hits a home run off the A's [[Rick Langford]], tying him with Reggie Jackson, and making Oglivie the first player not born in America to lead the AL in hom runs. \n*October 6 \u2013 After suffering through the three-game sweep of the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] the last three days, [[Joe Niekro]] wins his twentieth game of the season to earn a win for the [[Houston Astros]], 7\u20131, in a [[one-game playoff]]. It is the Astros' first Division Title.\n*October 9 \u2013 The [[Kansas City Royals]] win Game 2 of the [[1980 ALCS]] 3\u20132, but the game is remembered for the top of the eighth inning.  With [[Willie Randolph]] on first with two outs, [[Bob Watson]] lines a double to left.  Yankee third base coach [[Mike Ferraro]] waves Randolph home, and the Royals gun him down at the plate. With a national television audience looking on, Yankee owner [[George Steinbrenner]] is shown in the stands on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] game cameras shouting Ferraro's name at general manager [[Gene Michael]].  Steinbrenner ordered Yankee manager [[Dick Howser]] to fire Ferraro on the spot right after the game, but Howser refused.\n*October 10 \u2013 In Game 3 of the [[1980 American League Championship Series|1980 ALCS]], and with the [[New York Yankees]] leading 2\u20131, [[Kansas City Royals]]' George Brett delivered a three-run home run off Yankees' reliever [[Rich Gossage]], and with it total revenge for the Royals, who won the pennant after being second best to the Yankees in the ALCS in {{Baseball year|1976}}, {{Baseball year|1977}} and {{Baseball year|1978}}. Kansas City won the pennant in, of all places, [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]].  After the game, [[Dick Howser]] resigns as Yankee manager over the events in Game 2 involving [[Mike Ferraro]] as described above.\n* October 12 \u2013 The [[Philadelphia Phillies]] capture their first pennant since {{Baseball year|1950}} with a 10-inning, 8\u20137 win over the [[Houston Astros]] at the [[Astrodome]], in the fifth and final game of the [[National League Championship Series|NL Championship Series]]. Each of the last four games was decided in extra innings. The Phillies, down by three runs to [[Nolan Ryan]] in the 8th inning, rally and go ahead on [[Garry Maddox]]'s double in the 10th inning.\n* October 21 \u2013 The [[Philadelphia Phillies]] win the [[1980 World Series|World Series]], the first WS Championship in their 98-year history, by beating the [[Kansas City Royals]], 4\u20131, in Game Six. [[Steve Carlton]] earns the win, though the most memorable moment may be [[Tug McGraw]] on the mound jumping for joy as he earns the save after loading the bases with no outs.  Another equally memorable moment comes with one out in the bottom of the ninth when [[Frank White (baseball)|Frank White]]'s pop-up is bobbled by [[Bob Boone]], only to be tipped into the glove of [[Pete Rose]].  Philadelphia's [[Mike Schmidt]] is named MVP, hitting .381 with two home runs and seven RBI, while KC's [[Willie Wilson (baseball)|Willie Wilson]] is the \"[[Scapegoat|goat]]\", striking out a WS-record 12 times, including the final out of the Series with the bases loaded, and hitting only .154. Of the original 16 Major League franchises from {{Baseball year|1901}}, the Phillies are the last to win their first World Series.\n*October 22 - [[Dave Winfield]] of the San Diego Padres is officially declared a free agent. \n*October 26 - [[Ralph Houk]] comes out of retirement to become manager of the Boston Red Sox.\n\n===November===\n*November 3 \u2013 An era ends for the [[Oakland Athletics]] as the sale of the team is finalized.  The flamboyant [[Charlie O. Finley]] sells the team to [[Walter A. Haas]], ending his relationship with the team.\n*November 4 \u2013 [[Sadaharu Oh]] announces his retirement as a player from Japanese baseball. His 868 documented career [[home run]]s remain an unapproached world record among professional baseball players.\n*November 12:\n**[[Baltimore Orioles]] pitcher [[Steve Stone (baseball)|Steve Stone]], who led the American League with 25 victories, wins the Cy Young Award over [[Mike Norris (baseball)|Mike Norris]] of the [[Oakland Athletics]].\n**[[Don Zimmer]] is named manager of the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]], becoming the 10th manager in the club's nine-year history.\n*November 18 - [[Brad Gulden]] is traded for himself. The New York Yankees trade Gulden to the [[Seattle Mariners]] for veteran infielder [[Larry Milbourne]] and a player named later. In May 1981, Gulden is sent back to the Yankees as the player to be named later, officially making Gulden the first player since [[Harry Chiti]] to be traded for himself. \n*November 25 \u2013 [[Gene Michael]] becomes the 25th manager in [[New York Yankees]] history, replacing a fired [[Dick Howser]], who led the team to the American League East title with a 103\u201359 mark.\n*November 26 \u2013 [[Philadelphia Phillies]] third baseman [[Mike Schmidt]], who hit .286 with career highs of 48 home runs and 121 RBI, is a unanimous choice as National League Most Valuable Player.\n\n===December===\n*December 1 \u2013 [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] relief pitcher [[Steve Howe (baseball)|Steve Howe]] wins the National League Rookie of the Year Award, edging [[Montr\u00e9al Expos]] starting pitcher [[Bill Gullickson]] and outfielder [[Lonnie Smith]] of the [[Philadelphia Phillies]]. Howe posted a 7\u20139 record with a 2.65 ERA and 17 saves.\n*December 8 - In one of the largest trades ever at the annual winter meetings, the San Diego Padres sent catcher [[Bob Geren]], pitchers [[Rollie Fingers]], [[Bob Shirley]] and first baseman [[Gene Tenace]] to the St. Louis Cardinals in exchange for catchers [[Terry Kennedy (baseball)|Terry Kennedy]] and [[Steve Swisher]], pitchers [[John Littlefield]], [[Al Olmsted]], [[John Urrea]], [[Kim Seaman]], and infielder [[Mike Phillips (baseball)|Mike Phillips]]. Fingers never appears in a Cardinals uniform as he is traded again days later to the Milwaukee Brewers.\n*December 9 \u2013 The [[Chicago Cubs]] send relief pitcher [[Bruce Sutter]] to their arch-rivals, the [[St. Louis Cardinals]], in exchange for first baseman [[Leon Durham]]. Sutter will go on to save many more games for the Cardinals, while Durham's critical error in Game 5 of the [[1984 National League Championship Series|1984 NLCS]] will doom the Cubs.\n*December 12 \u2013 The [[St. Louis Cardinals]] trade future [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Fame]] [[closer (baseball)|closer]] [[Rollie Fingers]], [[All star]] [[catcher]] [[Ted Simmons]] and [[pitcher]] [[Pete Vuckovich]] to the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] for pitchers [[Dave LaPoint]] and [[Lary Sorensen]] and [[outfielder]]s [[David Green (baseball)|David Green]] and [[Sixto Lezcano]].\n*December 15 - [[Dave Winfield]] signs a 10-year 16 million dollar contract with the New York Yankees. This makes Winfield the richest athlete in pro sports at the time and signals the end of [[Reggie Jackson]]'s days in pinstripes as [[George Steinbrenner]] informs Jackson his free agent option will not be picked up once his current contract ends. \n*December 16 - The New York Mets sign [[Rusty Staub]] as a free agent. \n*December 20 - The [[Boston Red Sox]] missed the deadline to tender contracts to pending free agents. The blunder officially makes catcher [[Carlton Fisk]] and outfielder [[Fred Lynn]] free agents. This blunder cost Boston both players as Fisk signs with the Chicago White Sox and Lynn signs with the [[California Angels]].\n\n==Births==\n\n===January===\n*January 3 \u2013 [[Brad Salmon]]\n*January 10 \u2013 [[Matt Roney]]\n*January 12 \u2013 [[Bobby Crosby]]\n*January 15 \u2013 [[JD Closser]]\n*January 15 \u2013 [[Matt Holliday]]\n*January 16 \u2013 [[Brooks Conrad]]\n*January 16 \u2013 [[Albert Pujols]]\n*January 17 \u2013 [[T.

Instead of running towards first, Cowens runs and attacks Farmer as revenge for being hit by a pitcher from Farmer the previous season, which broke Cowens jaw and cost him to miss 21 games as a member of the [[Kansas City Royals]].

Despite the milestone, Ryan allows six runs in 4.1 innings and Houston loses, 8\u20131.\n**During the first-ever fireworks night hosted at [[Shea Stadium]], [[Montreal Expos]] Rookie [[Bill Gullickson]] sailed a pitch over [[New York Mets]] [[first baseman]] [[Mike Jorgensen]]'s head in the second game of a [[Doubleheader (baseball)|doubleheader]]. Jorgensen did not appreciate this as he had been the victim of one of the worst [[beanball]] injuries in baseball history the previous season with the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]], and motioned toward Gullickson his disapproval. Mets [[catcher]] [[John Stearns]], who was not even in the line-up for this game, charged out of the dugout and welcomed Gullickson to the majors by slamming him to the ground.\n*July 6 \u2013 [[Philadelphia Phillies]] pitcher [[Steve Carlton]] becomes the major leagues' left-handed strikeout king, fanning seven [[St. Louis Cardinals|Cardinals]] in an 8\u20133 Phillies win to bring his career total to 2,836.

His great day would put him on the cover of [[Sports Illustrated]] the following week.\n*September 30 - The New York Mets defeat the Pittsburgh Pirates 3-2 at Shea Stadium. Only 1,754 fans showed up, making it the smallest crowd to ever attend a game at Shea.\n\n===October===\n*October 1 - The Boston Red Sox fire manager [[Don Zimmer]] due to pressure from fans, who never forgave Zimmer for the late season collapse in 1978, who led to the one game play off oin which [[Bucky Dent]] hot the game winning home run for the Yankees over the green monster.\n*October 4 \u2013 In a 17\u20131 rout of the [[Minnesota Twins]], [[Willie Wilson (baseball)|Willie Wilson]] of the [[Kansas City Royals]] becomes the first major league player ever to be credited with 700 at-bats in a single season, and ends the year with 705 at bats. He also sets the [[American League|AL]] record for singles in a season with 184, eclipsing the mark [[Sam Rice]] set in {{Baseball year|1925}}.

The home run is Schmidt's 48th of the season, breaking [[Eddie Mathews]]' single-season record for third basemen set in {{Baseball year|1953}}.\n*October 5 \u2013 On October 3, the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] had been down three games to the [[Houston Astros]] to tie for the [[National League West Division]] title.

They will play a one-game playoff tomorrow.\n** [[Ben Oglivie]], who was born in [[Panama]],  of the Milwaukee Brewers hits a home run off the A's [[Rick Langford]], tying him with Reggie Jackson, and making Oglivie the first player not born in America to lead the AL in hom runs. \n*October 6 \u2013 After suffering through the three game sweep of the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] the last three days, [[Joe Niekro]] wins his twentieth game of the season to earn a win for the [[Houston Astros]], 7\u20131, in a [[one-game playoff]]. It is the Astros' first Division Title.\n*October 9 \u2013 The [[Kansas City Royals]] win Game 2 of the [[1980 ALCS]] 3-2, but the game is remembered for the top of the eighth inning.  With [[Willie Randolph]] on first with two outs, [[Bob Watson]] lines a double to left.  Yankee third base coach [[Mike Ferraro]] waves Randolph home, and the Royals gun him down at the plate. With a national television audience looking on, Yankee owner [[George Steinbrenner]] is shown in the stands on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] game cameras shouting Ferraro's name at general manager [[Gene Michael]].  Steinbrenner ordered Yankee manager [[Dick Howser]] to fire Ferraro on the spot right after the game, but Howser refused.\n*October 10 \u2013 In Game 3 of the [[1980 American League Championship Series|1980 ALCS]], and with the [[New York Yankees]] leading 2\u20131, [[Kansas City Royals]]' George Brett delivered a three-run home run off Yankees' reliever [[Rich Gossage]], and with it total revenge for the Royals, who won the pennant after being second best to the Yankees in the ALCS in {{Baseball year|1976}}, {{Baseball year|1977}} and {{Baseball year|1978}}. Kansas City won the pennant in, of all places, [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]].

[[Steve Carlton]] earns the win, though the most memorable moment may be [[Tug McGraw]] on the mound jumping for joy as he earns the save after loading the bases with no outs.  Another equally memorable moment comes with one out in the bottom of the ninth when [[Frank White (baseball)|Frank White]]'s pop-up is bobbled by [[Bob Boone]], only to be tipped into the glove of [[Pete Rose]].  Philadelphia's [[Mike Schmidt]] is named MVP, hitting .381 with two home runs and seven RBI, while KC's [[Willie Wilson (baseball)|Willie Wilson]] is the \"[[Scapegoat|goat]]\", striking out a WS-record 12 times, including the final out of the Series with the bases loaded, and hitting only .154.

The New York Yankees trade Gulden to the [[Seattle Mariners]] for veteran infielder [[Larry Milbourne]] and a player named later. In May of 1981, Gulden is sent back to the Yankees as the player to be named later, officially making Gulden the first player since [[Harry Chiti]] to be traded for himself. \n*November 25 \u2013 [[Gene Michael]] becomes the 25th manager in [[New York Yankees]] history, replacing a fired [[Dick Howser]], who led the team to the American League East title with a 103\u201359 mark.\n*November 26 \u2013 [[Philadelphia Phillies]] third baseman [[Mike Schmidt]], who hit .286 with career highs of 48 home runs and 121 RBI, is a unanimous choice as National League Most Valuable Player.\n\n===December===\n*December 1 \u2013 [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] relief pitcher [[Steve Howe (baseball)|Steve Howe]] wins the National League Rookie of the Year Award, edging [[Montr\u00e9al Expos]] starting pitcher [[Bill Gullickson]] and outfielder [[Lonnie Smith]] of the [[Philadelphia Phillies]].

Fingers never appears in a Cardinals uniform as he is traded again days later to the Milwaukee Brewers.\n*December 9 \u2013 The [[Chicago Cubs]] send relief pitcher [[Bruce Sutter]] to their arch-rivals, the [[St. Louis Cardinals]], in exchange for first baseman [[Leon Durham]]. Sutter will go on to save many more games for the Cardinals, while Durham's critical error in Game 5 of the [[1984 National League Championship Series|1984 NLCS]] will doom the Cubs.\n*December 12 \u2013 The [[St. Louis Cardinals]] trade future [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Fame]] [[closer (baseball)|closer]] [[Rollie Fingers]], [[All star]] [[catcher]] [[Ted Simmons]] and [[pitcher]] [[Pete Vuckovich]] to the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] for pitchers [[Dave LaPoint]] and [[Lary Sorensen]] and [[outfielder]]s [[David Green (baseball)|David Green]] and [[Sixto Lezcano]].\n*December 15 - [[Dave Winfield]] signs a 10 year 16 million dollar contract with the New York Yankees.

In Korea, a Go variant called [[Go variants#Sunjang Baduk|Sunjang baduk]] was played.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msoworld.com/mindzine/news/orient/go/history/sunjang.html |title=Historic: Sunjang Go |author=John Fairbairn |accessdate=2007-11-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060305195431/http://www.msoworld.com/mindzine/news/orient/go/history/sunjang.html |archivedate=2006-03-05 }}</ref>\n\n===Japan===\nAt the start of the [[Tokugawa Shogunate]], four [[Four go houses|Go academies]] were established. This table lists all heads of these houses, as well as some that were appointed heir but died before they became head of the house. Tokugawa also established the post of [[Godokoro]] (minister of Go), which was awarded to the strongest player of a generation. Such players were dubbed [[Meijin]] (brilliant man), which was considered equal to a 9 dan professional grade.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://senseis.xmp.net/?HistoricMeijin | author = Sensei's Library | title = Historic Meijins | accessdate = 2007-06-28 }}</ref> Over the 300-year period covered here, only ten players received the title of Meijin. Several other players (16 total) received the title of [[Jun-Meijin]] (half-Meijin), which is considered to equal an 8 dan professional grade and listed as such below. In some houses it was the custom that the head of the house was always named the same according to the [[iemoto]] system (\u5bb6\u5143). All heads of the house [[Inoue]] (\u4e95\u4e0a) were named Inseki (\u56e0\u78a9), heads of the house [[Yasui house|Yasui]] (\u5b89\u4e95 ) were named [[Yasui house|Senkaku]] (\u4ed9\u89d2) from the 4th head onward, and heads of the house [[Hayashi]] (\u6797) were named [[Monnyu]] (\u9580\u5165) from the second head onward. To distinguish between these players, the names listed below are the names they had before becoming head of their house, or after their retirement. The house [[Honinbo]] (\u672c\u56e0\u574a) had no such tradition, although heads would often take one character from the name of their predecessor into their own name, notably the character Shu (\u79c0) from the 14th head onward.\n{{clear}}\n{| class=\"toccolours\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; margin:0;\" \n!

This table lists all heads of these houses, as well as some that were appointed heir but died before they became head of the house. Tokugawa also established the post of [[Godokoro]] (minister of Go), which was awarded to the strongest player of a generation. Such players were dubbed [[Meijin]] (brilliant man), which was considered equal to a 9 dan professional grade.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://senseis.xmp.net/?HistoricMeijin | author = Sensei's Library | title = Historic Meijins | accessdate = 2007-06-28 }}</ref> Over the 300-year period covered here, only ten players received the title of Meijin. Several other players (16 total) received the title of [[Jun-Meijin]] (half-Meijin), which is considered to equal an 8 dan professional grade and listed as such below. In some houses it was the custom that the head of the house was always named the same according to the [[iemoto]] system (\u5bb6\u5143). All heads of the house [[Inoue]] (\u4e95\u4e0a) were named Inseki (\u56e0\u78a9), heads of the house [[Yasui house|Yasui]] (\u5b89\u4e95 ) were named [[Yasui house|Senkaku]] (\u4ed9\u89d2) from the 4th head onward, and heads of the house [[Hayashi]] (\u6797) were named [[Monnyu]] (\u9580\u5165) from the second head onward. To distinguish between these players, the names listed below are the names they had before becoming head of their house, or after their retirement. The house [[Honinbo]] (\u672c\u56e0\u574a) had no such tradition, although heads would often take one character from the name of their predecessor into their own name, notably the character Shu (\u79c0) from the 14th head onward.\n{{clear}}\n{| class=\"toccolours\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; margin:0;\" \n!

The ''K\u016brma\u015bataka'' is attributed to king [[Bhoja]] but the palaeography of the record itself suggests that this copy was engraved in the twelfth or thirteenth century.

These records prompted K. K. Lele to describe the building as the Bhoj\u015b\u0101l\u0101 or Hall of Bhoja because king Bhoja was the author of a number of works on poetics and grammar, among them the ''Sarasvat\u012bka\u1e47\u1e6dh\u0101bhara\u1e47a'' or 'Necklace of Sarasvat\u012b'.<ref>R.

Kincaid was a cynical observer but in any case the absence of the term Bhoj\u015b\u0101l\u0101 in his text indicates was \"no living tradition about the Bhoj\u0101l\u0101 in the middle decades of the nineteenth century\" among those with whom he interacted.<ref name=willis136>{{cite journal | last=Willis | first=Michael | title=Dh\u0101r, Bhoja and Sarasvat\u012b: from Indology to Political Mythology and Back | journal=Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society | publisher=Cambridge University Press | volume=22 | issue=1 | year=2012 | pages=136\u2013138 | doi=10.1017/s1356186312000041 }}</ref>\n\n==Sarasvat\u012b==\n[[File:Goddess Ambika from Dhar.JPG|thumb|Goddess Ambik\u0101 from Dh\u0101r, whose inscription mentions V\u0101gdev\u012b.

Year 1091.\n\n===Iconography===\nThe identification of the British Museum sculpture as Ambik\u0101 is confirmed by the iconographic features which conform to Ambik\u0101 images found elsewhere.<ref>M. N. P. Tiwari, ''Ambik\u0101 in Jaina Art and Literature'' (New Delhi: Bharatiya Jnanpith, 1989).</ref> A particularly close comparative example is the Ambik\u0101 in [[Sehore]] dating to the eleventh century.<ref>Sehore \u0938\u0940\u0939\u094b\u0930 (Madhya Pradesh). Ambik\u0101. Zenodo. http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3633937</ref> Like the Dh\u0101r sculpture, the Sehore image shows a youth riding a lion at the foot of the goddess and a figure with a beard standing at one side.\n\nThe inscription on the statue in the British Museum indicates that the V\u0101gdev\u012b at Dh\u0101r was dedicated to the Jain form of Sarasvat\u012b. However, the V\u0101gdev\u012b mentioned no longer exists or is yet to be located. Merutu\u1e45ga, who wrote in the early fourteenth century, indicates that Bhoja's eulogistic tablets in the Sarasvat\u012b temple were engraved with a poem dedicated to the first Jain T\u012brtha\u1e43kara, but these tablets too have not been located.<ref name=willis129/><ref>Tawney, ''Prabandhacint\u0101ma\u1e47i'', p. 57.</ref>\n\n==Current status==\nThe building is a [[Protected Monument]] of national importance under the laws of India and is under the jurisdiction of the [[Archaeological Survey of India]]. Both Hindus and Muslims claim the site, and use it for their prayers. According to Archaeological Survey of India guidelines, Muslims can pray on Friday and Islamic festivals, Hindus can pray on Tuesday and on the festival for goddess Sarasvat\u012b, namely [[Vasant Panchami]]. The site is open to visitors on other days.<ref name=willis129/><ref name=indiatoday2016/>\n\nThe disputes about the site were prompted by the inscriptions and the information they provide about historic Indian religions, particularly Hinduism and Jainism. Data about Jainism comes from texts and a statue of the goddess Ambik\u0101 that is now housed in [[British Museum]].<ref name=willis129/> The area beside the Bhoj\u015b\u0101l\u0101 has four Islamic tombs of [[Sufi]] saints.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ahmad Nabi Khan|title=Islamic Architecture in South Asia: Pakistan, India, Bangladesh|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r2tQAAAAMAAJ|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-579065-8|pages=175\u2013177}}</ref> The most important is the tomb of Kam\u0101l al-D\u012bn (''circa'' 1238-1330), famous [[Chishti]] saint, who tomb was rebuilt under the [[Malwa Sultanate]]. Architecturally, the Bhojshala is earlier in date, and appears to be a hypostyle hall built of temple parts in the 1300s in a manner similar to the Quwwat-ul-Islam in the [[Qutb Minar complex]], Delhi.<ref name=\"Willis 2012 134\u2013135\"/>\n\nConflicts arise when the Vasant Panchami falls on Friday. The Archaeological Survey of India attempts to assign hours to both Hindus and Muslims on such days. However, this been a source of communal conflict and occasional disturbance when the religious group scheduled for the earlier time slot refuse to vacate the premises in time for the next.<ref name=\"Manohar\"/><ref name=\"Indore celebrates Basant Panchmi\"/><ref name=indiatoday2016>[http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/dhar-bhojshala-kamal-maula-mosque-row-madhya-pradesh-vishwa-hindu-parishad/1/594073.html Bhojshala-Kamal Maula mosque row: What is the dispute over the temple-cum-mosque all about?], India Today, Shreya Biswas (February 12, 2016)</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ayodhya dispute]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110629155409/http://asi.nic.in/ Archaeological Survey of India]\n* [https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=182355&partid=1&searchText=Ambika&fromADBC=ad&toADBC=ad&numpages=10&orig=%2fresearch%2fsearch_the_collection_database.aspx&currentPage=1 British Museum, collections online]\n* [http://www.ioc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~islamarc/WebPage1/htm/dhar.htm University of Tokyo, photo album]\n\n==Research Resources==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20100330054040/http://www.ubka.uni-karlsruhe.de/kvk/kvk/kvk_en.html Karlsruher Virtueller Katalog]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20100327201448/http://www.ubka.uni-karlsruhe.de/hylib/virtueller_katalog.html About the KVK]\n*[https://archive.org/search.php?query=Luard%20AND%20mandu Internet Archives]\n*[http://www.soas.ac.uk/jainastudies/newsletter/ Jain Studies Newsletter, SOAS, London]\n*{{cite book|last=Acharya|first=Merutunga|title=Prabandhacintamani|url=https://archive.org/stream/bibliothecaindi04indigoog#page/n8/mode/1up|year=1902|publisher=Asiatic Society}}\n\n[[Category:Dhar]]\n[[Category:History of Madhya Pradesh]]\n[[Category:Medieval Hinduism]]\n[[Category:Paramara kingdom]]\n[[Category:Bhoja]]\n", "name_user": "Shirazibustan", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200e''R\u0101\u00fcla vela'' of Ro\u1e0da:wiki link added", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhojshala"}
