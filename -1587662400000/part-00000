For example, a 308 destined for the American market would sport much larger heavier bumpers and a slightly sturdier frame (and many other smaller details) in order to meet more stringent US road [[National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act|safety standards]]. American market cars also suffered a performance hit due to a compression ratio of 8.6:1 vs 9.2:1 for most of the rest of the world [[Automobile emissions control|state emissions legislation]] which reduced horsepower. As a result of these differences there is often a premium paid for the \"purer\" European spec car over the federalized car.[[File:308 euro us.jpg|200px|right|thumb|A 1979 Euro spec GTS (left) and a 1977 US spec GTB (right)]]\n\nSome differences between the Euro-spec and US-spec cars are shown below:\n* 240&nbsp;hp vs. 233&nbsp;hp\n* Different gear ratios\n* Lighter, small front bumper that follows the hood line vs. 2.5&nbsp;mph impact bumper that is extended and has extra \"fangs\"\n* Lighter, small rear bumper vs. impact bumper with spacer\n* Exposed dual tip muffler vs. black muffler cover with [[catalytic converter]]\n* Vitaloni style outside mirrors vs. larger flag mirrors that provide a better view for safety\n* Small yellow front side marker light with no rear side lights vs. large rectangular yellow front and red rear side marker lights (many euro cars now in the USA had the euro lights converted to USA spec and added the red rear lights)\n* No \"fasten seat belt\" warning light in Euro spec\n* Flash to pass driving lights in front grill in Euro spec\n* Space saver spare tyre vs. full size spare\n* Rear engine cover top has only a left and right grill vs. \"U\" shaped grill that provides a larger cooling area necessary for the added catalytic converter just behind the muffler.\n* Overall weight of Euro spec lower because of door beams and bumpers.\n\n== 308 GTB Millechiodi ==\nThe 308 GTB Millechiodi was an aerodynamic study based on the 308 GTB and designed by [[Pininfarina]].

For example, a 308 destined for the American market would sport much larger heavier bumpers and a slightly sturdier frame (and many other smaller details) in order to meet more stringent US road [[National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act|safety standards]]. American market cars also suffered a performance hit due to a compression ratio of 8.6:1 vs 9.2:1 for most of the rest of the world [[Automobile emissions control|state emissions legislation]] which reduced horsepower. As a result of these differences there is often a premium paid for the \"purer\" European spec car over the federalized car.[[File:308 euro us.jpg|200px|right|thumb|A 1979 Euro spec GTS (left) and a 1977 US spec GTB (right)]]\n\nSome differences between the Euro-spec and US-spec cars are shown below:\n*240&nbsp;hp vs. 233&nbsp;hp\n*Different gear ratios\n*Lighter, small front bumper that follows the hood line vs. 2.5&nbsp;mph impact bumper that is extended and has extra \"fangs\"\n*Lighter, small rear bumper vs. impact bumper with spacer\n*Exposed dual tip muffler vs. black muffler cover with [[catalytic converter]]\n*Vitaloni style outside mirrors vs. larger flag mirrors that provide a better view for safety\n*Small yellow front side marker light with no rear side lights vs. large rectangular yellow front and red rear side marker lights (many euro cars now in the USA had the euro lights converted to USA spec and added the red rear lights)\n*No \"fasten seat belt\" warning light in Euro spec\n*Flash to pass driving lights in front grill in Euro spec\n*Space saver spare tire vs. full size spare\n*Rear engine cover top has only a left and right grill vs. \"U\" shaped grill that provides a larger cooling area necessary for the added catalytic converter just behind the muffler.\n*Overall weight of Euro spec lower because of door beams and bumpers.\n\n== 308 GTB Millechiodi ==\nThe 308 GTB Millechiodi was an aerodynamic study based on the 308 GTB and designed by [[Pininfarina]].

Batholiths are almost always made mostly of [[felsic]] or [[Intermediate composition|intermediate]] rock types, such as [[granite]], [[quartz monzonite]], or [[diorite]] (see also ''[[granite dome]]'').\n[[File:Intrusion types.svg|thumb|upright=1.3| Basic types of intrusions:\n1.

[[Lopolith]]<br>\nNote:  As a general rule, in contrast to the active volcanic vent in the figure, these names refer to the fully cooled and usually millions-of-years-old rock formations, which are the result of the underground magmatic activity shown.]]\n\n==Formation==\nAlthough the may appear uniform, batholiths are in fact structures with complex histories and compositions. They are composed of multiple masses, or ''[[pluton]]s'', bodies of igneous rock of irregular dimensions (typically at least several kilometers) that can be distinguished from adjacent igneous rock by some combination of criteria including age, composition, texture, or mappable structures. Individual plutons are solidified from magma that traveled toward the surface from a zone of [[partial melting]] near the base of the Earth's crust.\n\n[[File:Vitosha platoto.jpg|thumb|The eroded laccolith above the batholith system of [[Vitosha]] - [[Plana (mountain)|Plana]] domed mountains, next to [[Sofia]], [[Bulgaria]]]]\n\nTraditionally, these plutons have been considered to form by ascent of relatively [[Buoyancy|buoyant]] magma in large masses called ''plutonic [[diapir]]s''. Because the diapirs are liquified and very hot, they tend to rise through the surrounding native [[Country rock (geology)|country rock]], pushing it aside and partially melting it. Most diapirs do not reach the surface to form [[volcano]]es, but instead they slow down, cool, and usually solidify 5 to 30 kilometers underground as plutons (hence the use of the word ''pluton''; in reference to the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] god of the underworld [[Pluto (god)|Pluto]]). An alternate view is that plutons commonly are formed not by ascent of large magma diapirs, but rather by aggregation of smaller volumes of magma that ascend as [[Dike (geology)|dikes]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hall|first1=Clarence A., Jr.|title=Introduction to the geology of southern California and its native plants|date=2007|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=9780520249325|page=22}}</ref>\n\nA batholith is formed when many plutons converge to form a huge expanse of granitic rock. Some batholiths are mammoth, paralleling past and present [[Subduction|subduction zones]] and other heat sources for hundreds of kilometers in [[continental crust]]. One such batholith is the [[Sierra Nevada Batholith]], which is a continuous granitic formation that makes up much of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] in [[California]]. An even larger batholith, the [[Coast Plutonic Complex]], is found predominantly in the [[Coast Mountains]] of western [[Canada]]; it extends for 1,800 kilometers and reaches into southeastern [[Alaska]].\n\n==Surface expression and erosion==\nA batholith is an exposed area of (mostly) continuous plutonic rock that covers an area larger than 100 square kilometers (40 square miles). Areas smaller than 100 square kilometers are called ''[[Stock (geology)|stocks]]''.<ref>GLENCOE SCIENCE | Earth Science Twelfth Grade High School Textbook (Georgia); pg. 115 paragraph 1, pg. 521 question 9</ref> However, the majority of batholiths visible at the surface (via outcroppings) have areas far greater than 100 square kilometers. These areas are exposed to the surface through the process of [[erosion]] accelerated by [[Orogeny|continental uplift]] acting over many tens of millions to hundreds of millions of years. This process has removed several tens of square kilometers of overlying rock in many areas, exposing the once deeply buried batholiths.\n\nBatholiths exposed at the surface are subjected to huge pressure differences between their former location deep in the earth and their new location at or near the surface. As a result, their [[crystal structure]] expands slightly over time. This manifests itself by a form of [[mass wasting]] called [[exfoliation (geology)|exfoliation]].

Batholiths are almost always made mostly of [[felsic]] or [[Intermediate composition|intermediate]] rock types, such as [[granite]], [[quartz monzonite]], or [[diorite]] (see also ''[[granite dome]]'').\n[[File:Intrusion types.svg|thumb|upright=1.3| Basic types of intrusions:\n1.

[[Lopolith]]<br>\nNote:  As a general rule, in contrast to the active volcanic vent in the figure, these names refer to the fully cooled and usually millions-of-years-old rock formations, which are the result of the underground magmatic activity shown.]]\n\n==Formation==\nAlthough they may appear uniform, batholiths are in fact structures with complex histories and compositions. They are composed of multiple masses, or ''[[pluton]]s'', bodies of igneous rock of irregular dimensions (typically at least several kilometers) that can be distinguished from adjacent igneous rock by some combination of criteria including age, composition, texture, or mappable structures. Individual plutons are solidified from magma that traveled toward the surface from a zone of [[partial melting]] near the base of the Earth's crust.\n\n[[File:Vitosha platoto.jpg|thumb|The eroded laccolith above the batholith system of [[Vitosha]] - [[Plana (mountain)|Plana]] domed mountains, next to [[Sofia]], [[Bulgaria]]]]\n\nTraditionally, these plutons have been considered to form by ascent of relatively [[Buoyancy|buoyant]] magma in large masses called ''plutonic [[diapir]]s''. Because the diapirs are liquified and very hot, they tend to rise through the surrounding native [[Country rock (geology)|country rock]], pushing it aside and partially melting it. Most diapirs do not reach the surface to form [[volcano]]es, but instead they slow down, cool, and usually solidify 5 to 30 kilometers underground as plutons (hence the use of the word ''pluton''; in reference to the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] god of the underworld [[Pluto (god)|Pluto]]). An alternate view is that plutons commonly are formed not by ascent of large magma diapirs, but rather by aggregation of smaller volumes of magma that ascend as [[Dike (geology)|dikes]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hall|first1=Clarence A., Jr.|title=Introduction to the geology of southern California and its native plants|date=2007|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=9780520249325|page=22}}</ref>\n\nA batholith is formed when many plutons converge to form a huge expanse of granitic rock. Some batholiths are mammoth, paralleling past and present [[Subduction|subduction zones]] and other heat sources for hundreds of kilometers in [[continental crust]]. One such batholith is the [[Sierra Nevada Batholith]], which is a continuous granitic formation that makes up much of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] in [[California]]. An even larger batholith, the [[Coast Plutonic Complex]], is found predominantly in the [[Coast Mountains]] of western [[Canada]]; it extends for 1,800 kilometers and reaches into southeastern [[Alaska]].\n\n==Surface expression and erosion==\nA batholith is an exposed area of (mostly) continuous plutonic rock that covers an area larger than 100 square kilometers (40 square miles). Areas smaller than 100 square kilometers are called ''[[Stock (geology)|stocks]]''.<ref>GLENCOE SCIENCE | Earth Science Twelfth Grade High School Textbook (Georgia); pg. 115 paragraph 1, pg. 521 question 9</ref> However, the majority of batholiths visible at the surface (via outcroppings) have areas far greater than 100 square kilometers. These areas are exposed to the surface through the process of [[erosion]] accelerated by [[Orogeny|continental uplift]] acting over many tens of millions to hundreds of millions of years. This process has removed several tens of square kilometers of overlying rock in many areas, exposing the once deeply buried batholiths.\n\nBatholiths exposed at the surface are subjected to huge pressure differences between their former location deep in the earth and their new location at or near the surface. As a result, their [[crystal structure]] expands slightly over time. This manifests itself by a form of [[mass wasting]] called [[exfoliation (geology)|exfoliation]]. This form of weathering causes convex and relatively thin sheets of rock to slough off the exposed surfaces of batholiths (a process accelerated by [[Weathering#Frost weathering|frost wedging]]). The result is fairly clean and rounded rock faces. A well-known result of this process is [[Half Dome]] in [[Yosemite Valley]].\n\n==Examples==\n\n===Africa===\n*Aswan Granite Batholith\n*Cape Coast Batholith, Ghana\n*Paarl Rock, South Africa\n*Darling Batholith, South Africa\n*[[Hook granite massif]], Zambia\n*Mubende Batholith, Uganda\n\n===Antarctica===\n*Antarctic Peninsula Batholith\n*Queen Maud Batholith\n\n===Asia===\n*[[Angara-Vitim batholith]], Siberia\n*[[Bhongir, Telangana|Bhongir]] Fort Batholith, [[Telangana]], India<ref>http://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/in-other-news/010616/telangana-bhongir-fort-s-batholith-marvel.html</ref>\n*Mount Abu, India <ref>http://suvratk.blogspot.com/2018/07/mount-abu-geology.html?m=1</ref>\n*[[Gangdese batholith]], Himalaya\n*Trans-Himalayan Batholith, Himalaya\n*[[Kalba-Narym batholith]], Kazakhstan\n*Karakorum Batholith, Himalaya\n*Tak batholith, Thailand\n*Tien Shan batholith, Central Asia\n*Ranchi batholith,Ranchi,India\n\n===Europe===\n*Bindal Batholith, Norway\n*[[Cornubian batholith]], England\n*Corsica-Sardinia Batholith\n*[[Donegal batholith]], Ireland\n*Leinster Batholith, Ireland\n*Mancellian batholith, France\n*[[North Pennine Batholith]], England\n*[[Ljusdal Batholith]], Sweden\n*[[Geology of Andorra|Mt-Louis-Andorra Batholith]]\n*Riga Batholith, Latvia\n*Salmi Batholith, Republic of Karelia, Russia\n*Sunnhordaland Batholith, Norway\n*[[Transscandinavian Igneous Belt]], Sweden and Norway\n:*Revsund Massif\n:*R\u00e4tan Batholith\n:*Sm\u00e5land\u2013V\u00e4rmland Belt\n\n===North America===\n*[[Bald Rock Dome|Bald Rock Batholith]]\n*[[Boulder Batholith]]\n*[[The Baths|British Virgin Islands]]\n*[[Chambers-Strathy Batholith]]\n*[[Enchanted Rock|Town Mountain Granite]] batholith, Texas\n*Golden Horn Batholith\n*[[Idaho Batholith]]\n*Ilimaussaq Batholith, [[Greenland]]\n*[[Kenosha Pass|Kenosha Batholith]]\n*[[Ruby Mountains]]\n*Rio Verde Batholith, Mexico\n*[[Sierra Nevada Batholith]]\n*[[South Mountain (Nova Scotia)|South Mountain Batholith, Nova Scotia]]\n*[[Peninsular Ranges]], [[Baja California (region)|Baja]] and [[Southern California]]<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=BFWXBAAAQBAJ&dq=%22Peninsular+Batholith%22&source=gbs_navlinks_s Douglas M.

When the final choice comes down to Peter and another employee, Peter blacks out from the stress. After he awakens in the hospital, Dr. Hartman connects him with a \"[[yacht rock]]\" music collection to help him relax. When the guys get hooked on the music as well, they learn of an upcoming Yacht Rock Cruise and decide to all go along. While attempting to board, Brian finds himself in a dog crate and stored beneath deck. On board, the rest of the family and Peter's friends rub shoulders with numerous stars. But when the ship's captain gets distracted hanging out with Peter, he leaves the bridge unattended as a rogue wave capsizes the ship. Struggling to survive, everyone has to make their way towards the bottom of the ship where the hull is the thinnest. When they finally reach their goal and meet up with Brian in the process, they realize that they have no tools to cut through the hull. Turning fearful as the water rises, the episode is resolved by simply cutting to everybody safe back at home.\n----\nNote: This episode is a parody of the film ''[[The Poseidon Adventure (1972 film)|The Poseidon Adventure]]''.\n |LineColor=#99FF00\n}}\n{{#invoke:Episode list|sublist|Family Guy (season 18)\n |EpisodeNumber= 331\n |EpisodeNumber2= 2\n |Title= Bri-Da\n |DirectedBy= Steve Robertson\n |WrittenBy= [[Tom Devanney]]\n |OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|2019|10|6}}\n |ProdCode= HACX19\n |Viewers= 2.31<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/sunday-final-ratings-oct-6-2019/|title='Sunday Night Football' adjusts up, 'The Simpsons,' 'Bless the Harts,' and others adjust down: Sunday final ratings|last=Welch|first=Alex|work=TV by the Numbers|date=October 8, 2019|accessdate=October 8, 2019}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary= Hungover after a night out, Peter, Joe, Quagmire and Cleveland realise they had a brilliant, million-dollar ideas but have no clue what it was.

When the final choice comes down to Peter and another employee, Peter blacks out from the stress. After he awakens in the hospital, Dr. Hartman connects him with a \"[[yacht rock]]\" music collection to help him relax. When the guys get hooked on the music as well, they learn of an upcoming Yacht Rock Cruise and decide to all go along. While attempting to board, Brian finds himself in a dog crate and stored beneath deck. On board, the rest of the family and Peter's friends rub shoulders with numerous stars. But when the ship's captain gets distracted hanging out with Peter, he leaves the bridge unattended as a rogue wave capsizes the ship. Struggling to survive, everyone has to make their way towards the bottom of the ship where the hull is the thinnest. When they finally reach their goal and meet up with Brian in the process, they realize that they have no tools to cut through the hull. Turning fearful as the water rises, the episode is resolved by simply cutting to everybody safe back at home.\n----\nNote: This episode is a parody of the film ''[[The Poseidon Adventure (1972 film)|The Poseidon Adventure]]''.\n |LineColor=#99FF00\n}}\n{{#invoke:Episode list|sublist|Family Guy (season 18)\n |EpisodeNumber= 331\n |EpisodeNumber2= 2\n |Title= Bri-Da\n |DirectedBy= Steve Robertson\n |WrittenBy= [[Tom Devanney]]\n |OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|2019|10|6}}\n |ProdCode= HACX19\n |Viewers= 2.31<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/sunday-final-ratings-oct-6-2019/|title='Sunday Night Football' adjusts up, 'The Simpsons,' 'Bless the Harts,' and others adjust down: Sunday final ratings|last=Welch|first=Alex|work=TV by the Numbers|date=October 8, 2019|accessdate=October 8, 2019}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary= Hungover after a night out, Peter, Joe, Quagmire and Cleveland realise they had a brilliant, million-dollar ideas but have no clue what it was.

The division's creation had been discussed since the beginning of 1939, with the intent to form it by breaking up the [[1st (United Kingdom) Division|1st&nbsp;Armoured Division]]. A lack of tanks resulted in this not happening until December 1939. After its creation, the division was deprived of forces for a short while until elements of the 1st&nbsp;Armoured Division were assigned to it.\n\nIn early 1940, priority for equipment was given to the 1st&nbsp;Armoured Division and the 2nd&nbsp;Armoured Division was forced to make do with whatever equipment could be provided. After the [[Battle of France]], with the threat of a German invasion ([[Operation Sealion]]) of the United Kingdom, priority for equipment shifted to the 2nd&nbsp;Armoured Division. While it was brought up to strength, it was planned to use the division to [[counterattack|counter-attack]] the flanks of any invasion force. In August 1940, elements of the division were transported to Egypt to reinforce [[Middle East Command]]. In October, it was decided to transfer the rest of the division. Before leaving it swapped a brigade with 1st&nbsp;Armoured Division, reducing the division to three armoured regiments.\n\nThe division arrived in Egypt in December 1940, and in the following months was stripped to support an expeditionary force that was dispatched to Greece ([[Operation Lustre]]). The rest of the division moved to the conquered province of [[Cyrenaica]] in [[Italian Libya]]. Its tanks were worn-out, mechanically unreliable, and supplemented by captured Italian models that were equally unreliable. In March, a German-Italian counter-attack led to the destruction of the division and the ejection of most British forces from Cyrenaica. The consensus of historians is there was little the division could have done to stop this.\n\nThe division was not reformed until 1976, during the [[Cold War]], after the [[2nd Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|2nd&nbsp;Infantry Division]] was renamed. In case of war, the new 2nd&nbsp;Armoured Division, of the [[British Army of the Rhine]], was intended to fight a delaying battle against their armoured counterparts in the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[Red Army]]. In 1982, the division ceased to exist as it reverted to its infantry title.\n\n==Second World War==\n===Background===\nDuring the [[Interwar period]], the [[British Army]] examined the [[Lessons learned|lessons learnt]] from the [[First World War]]. This included experimentation and development of [[Military theory|theories]] of [[Maneuver warfare|manoeuvre]] and [[Armoured warfare|armoured]]-warfare, as well as the creation of the short-lived [[Experimental Mechanized Force]].{{sfn|French|2001|pp=28\u201329}} The long-term impact was for the Army to start to move towards [[mechanisation]] to restore battlefield mobility.{{sfn|French|2001|pp=36\u201337}} By the 1930s, the army had established three types of division: the infantry division, the mobile division (later called the armoured division), and the motor division. The military historian David French wrote: \"The main role of the infantry ... was to break into the enemy's defensive position\". This would then be exploited by the mobile division, followed by the motor divisions that would \"carry out the rapid consolidation of the ground captured by the mobile divisions\" therefore \"transform[ing] the 'break-in' into a '[[Breakthrough (military)|break-through]]{{'}}\".{{sfn|French|2001|pp=37\u201341}}\n\nThe [[1st (United Kingdom) Division|Mobile Division]] was created in October 1937.{{sfn|Perry|1988|p=45}} French wrote that it was \"'tank-heavy' ... with too few infantry and support arms. It had six cavalry [[light tank]] regiments ... three [[Medium tank|medium]] regiments ... two [[motorized infantry]] battalions and two artillery regiments. The mechanized cavalry were designed to [[reconnoitre]], not to fight, and the infantry were intended to protect the tanks when they were resting and replenishing.\"{{sfn|French|2001|p=42}} [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[John Burnett-Stuart]], responsible for training the Mobile Division, stated the infantry were not \"to be put on to a position by tanks and told to hold it, and they are not meant to fight side by side with your tanks in the forefront\". French wrote this \"stood outside the mainstream of official [[Military doctrine|doctrine]]\", which promoted [[combined-arms]] co-operation to win battles and placed the British armoured formations at odds with their German counterparts in the ''{{lang|de|[[Panzerwaffe]]}}'' (Tank Arm). They had \"concluded that tanks working on their own or merely in conjunction with infantry would never be a decisive weapon\" and that \"the key to success lay in combining tanks and supporting arms in the same divisional organization\". According to French, this thinking predominated within the British armoured forces, until doctrine was reformed in 1942.{{sfn|French|2001|p=42}}\n\nIn the 1930s, [[Causes of World War II|tensions built]] between [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and the United Kingdom and its [[Allies of World War II|allies]].{{sfn|Bell|1997|pp=3\u20134}} During late 1937 and 1938, German demands for the annexation of the [[Sudetenland]] in [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovakia]] led to an [[international crisis]]. This was resolved in September by the [[Munich Agreement]], which accepted that the Germans would annexe the Sudetenland.{{sfn|Bell|1997|pp=258\u2013275, 277\u2013278}} Tension did not subside, and the British Government debated how best to prepare the Army for war. In January 1939, the [[Secretary of State for War]] [[Leslie Hore-Belisha, 1st Baron Hore-Belisha|Leslie Hore-Belisha]] proposed splitting the Mobile Division into two smaller formations but found no support for this move.{{sfn|Gibbs|1976|pp=503\u2013504}} The issue was broached a month later and was accepted in principle by the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]].{{sfn|Gibbs|1976|p=511}} Shortly after, the French were informed of a preliminary timetable for the arrival of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) in the event of war: \"One Regular Armoured Division will become available about the middle of 1940, the second would not be available 'till a later date\". The formation of a second division during this period was complicated by the slow pace of tank production.{{sfn|Gibbs|1976|pp=514, 525}}\n\n===Formation and home service===\n[[File:IWM-ARMY-TRAINING-6-6-light-tank-MkVIA-c1937.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Photograph of a Vickers light tank with one soldier by the gun turret and another looking through an opening in the front | A Vickers light tank of the 3rd&nbsp;Hussars]]\n\nThe 2nd&nbsp;Armoured Division was activated on 15&nbsp;December 1939, with [[Major-General (United Kingdom)|Major-General]] [[Frederick Hotblack]] as the first [[General Officer Commanding]] (GOC).{{sfn|Joslen|2003|p=16}} Hotblack joined the [[Royal Tank Regiment|Royal Tank Corps]] in 1916.

The Axis force withdrew after the Australians claimed three vehicles knocked out. The following day, a platoon from the 1st&nbsp;Tower Hamlet Rifles moved forward to ensure that the colonial fort near El Agheila was still unoccupied, before moving to take up an ambush position to the west of the town. Nearing the fort, they found it occupied and came under fire. Shortly afterwards, German armoured cars moved forward. A brief clash occurred that resulted in one German armoured car being knocked out, and an Australian gun crew suffering casualties. After this brief action, the British screening force withdrew to Mersa Brega ceding El Agheila to the Axis. At least one, and maybe two, German tanks were subsequently lost striking mines in this area (potentially left over Italian ones, which had not been cleared by the British).{{sfn|Maughan|1966|pp=36\u201338}}{{sfn|Jentz|1998|p=82}}\n\n{{Location map+|Libya|width=250|float=left|caption={{center|Key locations in Libya during this period. 1 \u2013 Mersa Brega; 2 \u2013 Agedabia; 3 \u2013 Antelat; <br>4 \u2013 Msus; 5 \u2013 Mechili; 6 \u2013 Derna}}|places=\n{{Location map~|Libya|lat=32.902222|long=13.185833|label=Tripoli|position=bottom}}\n{{Location map~|Libya|lat=32.076111|long=23.961389|label=Tobruk|position=top}}\n{{Location map~|Libya|lat=32.116667|long=20.066667|label=Benghazi|position=top}}\n{{Location map~|Libya|lat=30.266667|long=19.2|label=El Agheila|position=left}}\n{{Location map~|Libya|lat=30.435|long=19.666944|label=1|position=bottom}}\n{{Location map~|Libya|lat=30.755556|long=20.225278|label=2|position=bottom}}\n{{Location map~|Libya|lat=31.07|long=20.35|label=3|position=right}}\n{{Location map~|Libya|lat=31.583333|long=21.016667|label=4|position=right}}\n{{Location map~|Libya|lat=32.166667|long=22.283333|label=5|position=right}}\n{{Location map~|Libya|lat=32.766667|long=22.633333|label=6|position=left}}\n}}\n\nOn 31&nbsp;March, the Axis forces renewed their attack. After dawn, the first clash of the day occurred with the 5th&nbsp;RTR. Sources either describe one clash from the British or German perspective, or two separate events. The 5th&nbsp;Light Division reported engaging up to five British tanks, in two inconclusive engagements with no losses on either side. The 5th&nbsp;RTR reported a patrol of four tanks observing the advance of the Axis forces. This was then engaged with one British tank damaged, and three Italian M13s potentially destroyed.{{sfn|Jentz|1998|pp=89\u201391}}{{sfn|Maughan|1966|p=49}} By 09:00, the 3rd&nbsp;Armoured Brigade started to withdraw following their prearranged plans.{{sfn|Jentz|1998|p=91}} After 10:00, the Germans moved forward towards the main position held by the Support Group at Mersa Brega. [[Skirmisher|Skirmishing]] took place between the [[Outpost (military)|outposts]] held by the Tower Hamlet Rifles and the Germans, before the forward troops fell back to the main position. During the day, the fighting increased with both sides calling upon artillery to bombard each other's positions. {{sfn|Maughan|1966|pp=49\u201350}}\n\nA {{lang|de|[[Luftwaffe]]}} attack by [[Junkers&nbsp;Ju&nbsp;87]] ({{lang|de|Stuka}}) dive bombers was also conducted. The 2nd&nbsp;Armoured Division's AA gunners reported two planes shot down, and the Germans recorded a [[friendly fire]] incident with one bomber attacking German tanks. During this period, the 2nd&nbsp;Support Group reported having repulsed two attacks and driving off an advance by German armoured cars. The Germans recorded their own success in suppressing the British positions, destroying numerous vehicles that were within range of their guns and at least one tank of the 5th&nbsp;RTR. A request for the 3rd &nbsp;Armoured Brigade to be deployed to assist was denied. Gambier-Perry reported there was \"insufficient time to get them into action from their present position before dark\".{{sfn|Maughan|1966|pp=49\u201350}}{{sfn|Jentz|1998|pp=90\u201391}} After 18:00, a heavy German barrage was fired and two attacks were launched. The first was repulsed, while the second managed to make gains in the Tower Hamlet position. A counter-attack was launched by a [[Reconnaissance|scout platoon]] that restored the position with the loss of eight [[universal carrier]]s. After dark, the Support Group withdrew. By the next morning, they had moved {{convert|30|mi|km|abbr=off}} to [[Ajdabiya|Agedabia]]. Under the cover of dark, the Germans carefully advanced and captured Mersa Brega without incident the next morning; the fighting had cost the division at least 59 men.{{sfn|Jentz|1998|pp=90\u201391}}{{sfn|Maughan|1966|pp=51\u201352}}\n\n====April====\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-782-0016-08A, Nordafrika, zerst\u00f6rter englischer Panzer.jpg|thumb|Alt=Photograph of a Cruiser IV tank | An abandoned Cruiser IV of the 5th&nbsp;RTR.]]\nDuring 1 April, the 3rd&nbsp;Armoured Brigade continued to withdraw but lost more tanks to mechanical breakdowns.{{sfn|Jentz|1998|p=91}} The Germans caught up with the Support Group at first light on 2&nbsp;April. At 10:30, an attack was launched that included infantry and up to 50 tanks. At the same time, the Support Group was given the order to withdraw. A scout platoon attempted to conduct a [[rearguard]] action to allow the rest of the Tower Hamlet Rifles to get away and was lost in the process. While retreating, B&nbsp;Company was outflanked by eight German tanks and forced to surrender. The Support Group withdrew {{convert|30|mi|km|abbr=off}} to the north and took up new positions.{{sfn|Maughan|1966|p=54}} Out on the desert flank, the 3rd Armoured Brigade was still withdrawing, at {{convert|7|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} to match the slowest vehicles that were towing artillery. For most of the day, their movements were shadowed by armoured vehicles they were unable to identify. During the afternoon, the withdrawal was further slowed by breakdowns, conflicting orders, as well as the need to rest and refuel allowing the nearby armoured vehicles to gain ground. Two [[troop]]s from the 5th&nbsp;RTR were ordered to conduct a rearguard action and took [[hull-down]] positions.{{sfn|Jentz|1998|pp=92\u201393}}\n\nThe 5th&nbsp;RTR decided the shadowing tanks were Italian (they were German). The Axis tanks advanced in arrowhead formation straight at the British position. When the range was between {{convert|900|\u2013|1500|yd|m|abbr=off}}, both sides opened fire. The 5th&nbsp;RTR suffered five tank losses and 24 casualties, claiming at least eight tanks in return.{{sfn|Jentz|1998|pp=92\u201395}} The historian Thomas Jentz wrote that German records show only three German tanks were destroyed, \"along with an unrecorded number damaged\".{{sfn|Jentz|1998|p=101}} The remaining British tanks withdrew to friendly positions farther behind and then the regiment regrouped {{convert|2|mi|km|abbr=off}} back. The brigade resumed its retreat, with no German vehicles following.{{sfn|Jentz|1998|pp=94\u201395}} During the day, there were contradictory orders, sometimes delayed, from Gambier-Perry, Neame and Wavell to the division; if it should continue or was it capable of blocking the coastal road, how it would conduct its withdrawal and if the division should keep together or split its forces. The discussions were hampered by ignorance of events, and notably included Neame informing Gambier-Perry that the 3rd Armoured Brigade was not to be committed en masse without his permission.{{sfn|Carver|2002|p=21}}{{sfn|Maughan|1966|pp=57\u201358}}\n\nBy the morning of 3&nbsp;April, the 3rd&nbsp;Armoured Brigade had reached Antelat, and had been seen by German aerial reconnaissance.{{sfn|Playfair|Flynn|Molony|Toomer|2004b|pp=25\u201326}}{{sfn|Jentz|1998|pp=96, 95}} Rommel immobilised most of the 5th&nbsp;Light Division around Bir el Ageradt to allocate as much transport as possible to bring up fuel to keep advancing.{{sfn|Jentz|1998|pp=95\u201396}} German and Italian detachments were ordered to probe around the southern flank of the 2nd&nbsp;Armoured Division, including a reconnoitre towards [[Msus]].{{sfn|Playfair|Flynn|Molony|Toomer|2004b|pp=25\u201326}} German scouts had detected around thirty tanks that appeared to be out of fuel, and a reinforced tank battalion was ordered to advance towards Bir el Ageradt, to engage them.{{sfn|Jentz|1998|pp=95\u201396}} During the early afternoon, the movements of the 3rd&nbsp;H and the 6th&nbsp;RTR caused alarm and confusion within the 5th&nbsp;RTR, which at first had believed them to be German; no engagements took place with Axis forces.{{sfn|Jentz|1998|p=96}} The RAF spotted Axis forces approaching Msus, site of the main divisional supply dump. The 3rd&nbsp;Armoured Brigade, along with some elements of the Support Group, were ordered to move to Msus to deal with the Axis forces. The division was crippled by a breakdown in communication, the result of late, missed, and conflicting orders. None of the division arrived at Msus during the day, and it was established late in the afternoon that the RAF had mistakenly identified friendly vehicles in the area.{{sfn|Maughan|1966|pp=59\u201363}} By the end of the day, the 3rd&nbsp;Armoured Brigade had been reduced to 18 light tanks, 26 Italian tanks, and 12 cruisers.{{sfn|Jentz|1998|p=96}}\n\nOn 4&nbsp;April, Rommel ordered units to advance in various directions, with objectives as far as Tobruk. Benghazi was liberated by Axis forces at dawn, having been abandoned by the 2nd Armoured Division and other Allied forces.{{sfn|Playfair|Flynn|Molony|Toomer|2004b|pp=26\u201327}} The only clash with Axis forces during the day occurred when artillery fire from the divisional Support Group halted German reconnaissance forces near [[Charruba]].{{sfn|Playfair|Flynn|Molony|Toomer|2004b|p=27}} At midday, Lieutenant-General [[Richard O'Connor]] (GOC [[Egypt Command|British Troops in Egypt]]) arrived at the front and held a meeting with senior commanders in Cyrenaica, including Gambier-Perry.

Axis forces had outrun their supplies. Their lead elements had halted having also suffered from mechanical breakdowns. The KDG and other Allied units verified there were no Axis forces near Msus.

The Brigade formed a perimeter around the fort, with the 11th&nbsp;Cavalry and a battery of anti-tank guns holding the eastern flank, and the 2nd&nbsp;Lancers and a battery of guns holding the western flank. The 18th&nbsp;Cavalry dispatched numerous patrols.{{sfn|Maughan|1966|p=76}}}}\n\nAround 09:00, two Axis field guns fired on the fort at Mechili.

Two hours later, two trucks drove towards the positions held by the [[11th Cavalry (Frontier Force)|11th&nbsp;Prince Albert Victor's Own Cavalry (Frontier Force)]] (11th&nbsp;PAVO). An attached Australian anti-tank gun fired on both trucks, halting them. The Axis soldiers, one German and twenty Italians, dismounted and were soon captured by a patrol of the 11th&nbsp;PAVO. Another patrol by the brigade captured another Italian prisoner, who had been directing artillery fire on the fort. The 11th&nbsp;PAVO captured more Axis troops during the day while patrolling the perimeter.{{sfn|Maughan|1966|pp=84, 89}} Neame, unaware of the attack, set off into the desert to locate Gambier-Parry to deliver new instructions. The attack on the fort prompted O'Connor to order a general withdrawal of all Allied forces towards [[Gazala]] via Derna.{{sfn|Playfair|Flynn|Molony|Toomer|2004b|p=28}}{{sfn|Maughan|1966|pp=85\u201386}}\n\nWhat followed was a series of confusing and conflicting orders that fragmented the division and omitted the 3rd&nbsp;Indian Motor Brigade.{{sfn|Maughan|1966|pp=86, 94}} At first the division moved east towards Mechili. Following the new instructions, the Support Group moved north towards the coastal road to withdraw towards Gazala via Derna. The divisional headquarters, including Gambier-Parry and a battery of artillery, continued towards Mechili. The 3rd&nbsp;Armoured Brigade turned north for [[Marawa, Libya|Maraura]] due to a lack of fuel but found little petrol there. The brigade moved towards Derna via [[Al Qubbah|Giovanni Berta]], as the [[2nd Lancers (Gardner's Horse)]] (2nd&nbsp;Lancers) escorted a fuel convoy from Mechili towards where they expected the division to be.{{sfn|Playfair|Flynn|Molony|Toomer|2004b|p=28}}{{sfn|Maughan|1966|pp=86, 89, 102}} The Axis advance through the desert continued. In the early afternoon, an [[18th King Edward's Own Cavalry]] (18th&nbsp;Cavalry) patrol from [[El Adem]], moved to assist RAF personnel at [[Acroma]], near Tobruk and captured 18 Italians, the most advanced Axis force.{{sfn|Maughan|1966|p=87}} By 17:00, more Axis troops had reached Mechili but not enough to attack; one was expected the next day. Towards dusk, a German officer entered the British perimeter to demand the garrison's surrender and was refused.{{sfn|Maughan|1966|p=89}} German troops briefly managed to block some desert tracks near Derna before moving to take up positions near the main coastal road east of the town. German patrols intercepted and disrupted some Allied convoys, but the route east remained open until the following day.{{sfn|Maughan|1966|pp=90\u201395}}\n\nDuring the early hours of 7&nbsp;April, Brigadier [[Reginald Rimington]], GOC 3rd&nbsp;Armoured Brigade, was mortally wounded and captured following his attempt to drive to Derna via an inland desert track. By dawn, the 2nd&nbsp;Support Group and the 3rd&nbsp;Armoured Brigade were stretched out, largely stuck in traffic west of Derna and as far back as [[Slonta]] (north of Mechili). The Tower Hamlet Rifles were positioned guarding the western end of the Giovanni Berta pass, near Derna. Gambier-Perry and the 3rd&nbsp;Indian Motor Brigade had been surrounded at Mechili.{{sfn|Maughan|1966|pp=94\u201395}} Axis armoured cars had penetrated as far as [[Timimi]] (near Gazala) and ambushed some retreating Australian forces. They were repulsed following the fortunate appearance of a 5th&nbsp;RTR cruiser tank that had been separated from the rest of the regiment.{{sfn|Maughan|1966|pp=95\u201396}} At 10:00, after elements of the division had passed through Derna, a squadron of the KDG were detached to guard the Derna airfield ({{convert|6|mi|km|abbr=off}} south of the town) to help keep the inland road open. Elements of the Tower Hamlet Rifles were nearby. By 14:30, the 5th&nbsp;RTR, now down to four tanks due to mechanical breakdowns, was the last of the divisional tank units to arrive near the airfield; they formed a rearguard. During the early afternoon, the KDG were engaged in a prolonged fight with the vanguard of the Axis forces. Around 15:00, the KDG and some infantry were ordered to withdraw and inadvertently isolated other parts of the rearguard, including the 5th&nbsp;RTR.{{sfn|Playfair|Flynn|Molony|Toomer|2004b|p=29}}{{sfn|Maughan|1966|pp=97\u201398}}\n\n[[Lieutenant colonel (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-Colonel]] [[Henry Dinham Drew|Henry Drew]], commander of the 5th&nbsp;RTR, led the rearguard of his four tanks, elements of the Tower Hamlet Rifles, some anti-tank guns, and elements of the 7th&nbsp;Armoured Division that had been moved up (A&nbsp;Company, 1st&nbsp;Battalion, King's Royal Rifle Corps; and J&nbsp;Battery, 3rd&nbsp;Royal Horse Artillery).{{sfn|Playfair|Flynn|Molony|Toomer|2004b|p=29}}{{sfn|Maughan|1966|pp=97\u201398}}{{sfn|Joslen|2003|p=218}} Around 16:00, German forces at the airfield moved to secure the road and attacked towards Drew's forces.

As the four tanks advanced towards the German positions, fifty other vehicles containing the rearguard (including some Australian forces) moved off. While some vehicles were knocked out, the tanks were able to keep the German forces busy enough to allow the rest to move past the area after which they dispersed; the four tanks were lost.{{sfn|Maughan|1966|p=99}} Barton Maughan, author of the Australian official history for this period of the fighting, wrote \"by coincidence ... the 5th&nbsp;Royal Tanks ... [were] where they were most needed and could be most effectively employed that day\".{{sfn|Maughan|1966|p=99}} The British official history recorded \"the action cleared the road also for any troops that remained in Derna\" as well as allowing the force to break away.{{sfn|Playfair|Flynn|Molony|Toomer|2004b|p=29}}\n\n===Surrender===\n\nAt Mechili, on 7&nbsp;April, the Germans continued to build up their forces surrounding the division's position. At dawn, elements of the 3rd&nbsp;Indian Motor Brigade, supported by a battery of guns, launched a minor and unsuccessful road on the Axis positions. It resulted in the loss of two guns, along with one man killed and another wounded. At 11:00, Axis guns opened fire from a nearby ridge. A small detachment of troops in a truck with a [[Vickers machine gun]] moved out of the division's position and attempted to move close to the guns to capture them. They were unable to get close enough to attack. The shelling continued, damaging vehicles but inflicting few casualties. The Germans sent an officer to demand surrender. Gambier-Parry rebuffed this demand, as he believed the German to be bluffing to hide their weakened force and position.{{sfn|Playfair|Flynn|Molony|Toomer|2004b|p=30}}{{sfn|Maughan|1966|p=102}} In the afternoon, Italian forces launched a minor attack on the positions held by the 2nd&nbsp;Lancers and were repulsed. Several Italians were captured along with two anti-tank guns. Axis forces subsequently bombarded the division's positions for thirty minutes. At some point during the day, contemporary sources differ on times, 'A'&nbsp;Squadron, 18th&nbsp;Cavalry entered the Mechili perimeter having skirmished with Axis armoured cars en route.{{sfn|Maughan|1966|p=102}} In the evening, a second German officer approached the division to demand surrender and was also refused by Gambier-Perry.{{sfn|Playfair|Flynn|Molony|Toomer|2004b|p=30}}{{sfn|Maughan|1966|p=102}} This refusal was followed by an artillery bombardment, machine-gun fire, and some skirmishing between patrols outside the main positions. Previously Gambier-Perry had been out of contact with Cyrenaica Command. Around 22:00, communication was re-established, and Gambier-Perry was informed that the rest of his division would not be joining him nor any other reinforcements. He was ordered to break-out at first light and head for El Adem.{{sfn|Maughan|1966|p=103}}\n\nThe break-out was to be led by one squadron of the 18th&nbsp;Cavalry along with a single cruiser tank, which belonged to the divisional headquarters. This [[vanguard]] was to attack east towards the Axis defensive positions before dawn, to negate their anti-tank gun defensive capability. This eastward move, towards the strongest Axis positions, would be followed by a column formed from the brigade and divisional headquarters. This, in turn, would be followed by engineers, and then all other remaining personnel. The 11th&nbsp;PAVO would provide flank protection, and the 2nd&nbsp;Lancers would form the rearguard of the column. The anti-tank guns were spread out among the column's various units. It was hoped this attack would break through the position and provide a direct retreat route, avoiding the need to drive deeper into the desert, on a meandering route and through difficult terrain, to bypass Axis forces.{{sfn|Maughan|1966|pp=103\u2013104}} Maughan wrote, \"If the original plan had been adhered to, if it had been boldly executed, a great measure of success might have been achieved. But the operation miscarried badly\".{{sfn|Maughan|1966|p=104}} \n\nThe tank did not arrive on time, and the attack was delayed to allow it to move up to the start line. This resulted in the loss of the cover of dark. Despite this, 24 vehicles of the 18th&nbsp;Cavalry achieved surprised charging the Italian battery of 12&nbsp;guns. The Indians dismounted and attacked at bayonet point, scattering the battery's personnel for the loss of at least two dead and 15 wounded. With their mission achieved, they remounted their vehicles and proceeded with the escape plan. Instead of following up this move, the rest of the escape column awaited the cruiser to advance. The 11th&nbsp;PAVO attacked and a large portion of their force broke through the Axis defensive positions followed by the 3rd&nbsp;Indian Motor Brigade headquarters. The main body followed the cruiser, which moved towards the gun battery previously silenced by the 18th&nbsp;Cavalry. The Italians, having recovered from the shock of the attack, had returned to their guns. They engaged and destroyed the tank, resulting in the death of the entire crew. Now alert to the British attack, Axis guns from around the Mechili perimeter opened fire. The artillery and heavy machine gun fire hindered the ability of the division's non-armoured vehicles to attempt a break-out. This was followed by an attack by Axis infantry and German tanks. Two Australian anti-tank guns, part of the rearguard, opened fire in a fierce battle with the German tanks, but were unable to stop their attack; the majority of the crews were killed or wounded.{{sfn|Playfair|Flynn|Molony|Toomer|2004b|p=30}}{{sfn|Maughan|1966|pp=104\u2013107}} \n\nVaughan, who had broken out, returned towards Mechili to aid the extradition of the 2nd&nbsp;Lancers. There was discussion of a break-out to the south or the west, however, Gambier-Perry made the decision to surrender to spare the men in the non-armoured vehicles from suffering unnecessary casualties. His surrender was not immediately known to all forces still in the Mechili perimeter due to a sandstorm. However, by 08:00 all fighting had ceased. Elements of the garrison refused to capitulate, in particular 'M'&nbsp;battery 3rd&nbsp;RHA and portions of the 2nd&nbsp;Lancers who, with non-armoured vehicles, charged the Axis positions and pushed through them without a fight. Eventually, most of these troops were able to make it back to Allied lines at Tobruk, some taking prisoners en route. Those who did not attempt to escape were captured along with Gambier-Perry and Vaughan. In total, around 3,000 prisoners were taken.{{sfn|Playfair|Flynn|Molony|Toomer|2004b|p=30}}{{sfn|Maughan|1966|pp=107\u2013108}}\n\nThe remnants of 6th&nbsp;RTR, 'C'&nbsp;Squadron, which had failed to reach Derna before it was taken, moved south into the desert to avoid Axis forces. They continued to move east, before meeting British reconnaissance forces near El Adem on 10&nbsp;April. They had been reduced to a force of four trucks. From there, they were escorted into Tobruk, reaching the port an hour before midnight.{{sfn|Maughan|1966|p=100}} On 10&nbsp;May 1941, the 2nd&nbsp;Armoured Division was officially disbanded.{{sfn|Joslen|2003|p=16}}\n\n===Assessment===\n\nMaughan wrote, \"at what great risk and cost had these tanks been shipped across the seas from England to the Middle East!

It was a collection of units, three of which had only joined shortly before the action, rather than a trained formation. The breakdown in control and administration was largely due to this fact\".{{sfn|French|2001|p=227}} Gambier-Parry was described as \"a conventional and slow minded soldier who couldn't cope with the unexpected\". David French describes the critique as harsh; the divisional commander \"was not a cavalryman\" and had transferred from the infantry to the Royal Tank Corps.{{sfn|French|2001|p=231}} French looked at \"the ineptitude of [the division's] undertrained staff\", as well as a lack of logistical support. \"[T]he disaster that overtook [the division] was in part caused by the fact that it had no railhead and could not be provided with sufficient motor transport to enable it to build up a sufficient reserve of supplies some {{convert|350|mi|}} from the nearest base.\"{{sfn|French|2001|p=117, 231}}\n\nThe [[Field Marshal (United Kingdom)|field marshal]] and historian [[Michael Carver, Baron Carver|Michael Carver]] wrote \"a combination of long delays in communications, resulting in misunderstandings and changes in orders, and a general breakdown of the logistical organization within [the division], led to a collapse of any effective resistance\".{{sfn|Carver|2002|p=21}} In reviewing the defeat, including the loss of the division, Carver noted it, \"must be attributed to failure to face realities at every level. The general state of the force, in terms of training, professional competence, logistical supply and serviceability of equipment, meant that it was no match for its opponent\".{{sfn|Carver|2002|p=22}} The general and historian [[David Fraser (British Army officer)|David Fraser]] wrote, once \"the Germans chose to drive across the chord of the Cyrenaican arc there was little to stop them\", as the 2nd&nbsp;Armoured Division \"had little fighting capacity left as a coherent formation of all arms\" following the extensive breakdown of equipment. Had it been able to fight, Fraser criticised a chain of command that would have hindered its ability; the 3rd&nbsp;Armoured Brigade \"was subjected to the orders of ... Gambier-Parry; ... Neame; ... Wavell\" and O'Connor.{{sfn|Fraser|1999|p=151}}\n\nThe historian Thomas Jentz argues that, considering the mechanical state of their tanks, the 2nd&nbsp;Armoured Division \"didn't have anything to lose in conducting ambush counter-attacks\" against their Axis opponents \"as recommended in their tactical manual. At no time [was the division] a threat or a hindrance to the advancing German-Italian forces\" largely as a result of how they were \"tactically handled\".{{sfn|Jentz|1998|p=101}} Jentz lauded the courage of the tank crews, but criticised their inflexible attitude towards combat and especially manoeuvre, which required permission from the next level in the chain of command to move even one tank. Jentz argued that this lack of flexibility, mixed with a lack of alternative firing positions, explained the rapid tank losses that occurred when the division did engage their opponents. Jentz also criticised the Germans, who showed an equal lack of flexibility against their own doctrine. This resulted in the two sides lining up to fire at one another rather than manoeuvring. The lack of understanding on the Germans' part about the intention of the 2nd&nbsp;Armoured Division resulted in the 5th Light Division being \"decimated by mechanical breakdowns\" due to \"unnecessarily rushing through the desert\", a move that resulted in 83 tanks having to be sent to workshops.{{sfn|Jentz|1998|pp=101\u2013102}}\n\n==Cold War==\n===Background===\nAt the end of the Second World War, the United Kingdom was allocated an [[Allied-occupied Germany|occupation zone]] in northwest Germany. It formed the [[British Army of the Rhine]] (BAOR) to administer its occupation forces. Following the creation of [[West Germany]], the BAOR ceased being an occupation force and became part of the UK's [[Northern Army Group|contribution to the defence]] of [[Western Europe]] from the [[Soviet Union]].{{sfn|Isby|1988|p=336}}{{sfn|Speiser|2016|p=1}} This role was reaffirmed at the 1954 [[London and Paris Conferences]], with the promise to commit four divisions to the defence of Europe.{{sfn|Rees|2013|p=57}} While the BAOR fluctuated in size and the number of divisions, it was founded with and maintained the [[2nd Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|2nd&nbsp;Infantry Division]] throughout this period.{{sfn|Isby|1988|p=336}} By the 1960s, the BAOR had been reduced to three divisions. The division's brigades had adopted a [[Square division|square organisation]]; each consisted of two armoured battalions and two mechanised infantry battalions.{{sfn|Isby|1988|p=331}}\n\n[[File:British 2nd Infantry Division.svg|thumb|left|alt=Illustration of the 2nd&nbsp;Division's divisional insignia\u2014two old keys | The divisional insignia of the 2nd&nbsp;Division, since its adoption during the Second World War, and used throughout the Cold War and during the period as an armoured division.{{sfn|Lord|Watson|2003|p=28}}{{sfn|Horseman|Shaw|1983|p=126}}]]\n\nBy the 1970s, the UK was in the position of having to reconcile decreasing resources with its commitments and the increased threat of the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Isby|1988|p=332}} In 1974, following the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|general election]], [[Roy Mason]] became [[Secretary of State]]. He authored the [[Mason Review]], a Government [[White paper]] outlining the new defence policy. It reaffirmed the Soviet Union as the primary threat to British national security and the need to concentrate its forces in Western Europe.{{sfn|Taylor|2010|pp=6\u20137}} Mason argued for proposed changes that would \"maintain as far as possible the present combat capability of the Army in Europe ... while reducing the overall number of men\".{{sfn|Mason|1975|p=I-22}} This would be achieved by disbanding headquarter units, including the elimination of \"the brigade level of command\" with battalions being \"commanded directly by smaller-sized divisional headquarters\". The overall aim was to have \"fewer formation headquarters overall, and fewer but larger units\".{{sfn|Mason|1975|p=I-23}} These changes were to maintain the BAOR's ability to wage \"a mobile and intense armoured battle\" against invading Soviet forces.{{sfn|Mason|1975|pp=III=8\u20139}}\n\nHistorian David Isby wrote that Mason's reforms were promised \"with an alleged 25 percent increase in combat power\".{{sfn|Isby|1988|p=332}} This increase was to be brought about by more efficient use of manpower, streamlining the logistical elements of the division and improving the ratio of weapons and men.{{sfn|Dodd|1977|p=373}} Historian Marc Donald DeVore argued the politically forced change coincided with BAOR doctrinal changes that had started in the 1960s. They were subsequently pioneered by the 1st&nbsp;Armoured Division in the early 1970s: to fight a mobile defensive battle by defending key attack routes that Soviet armoured forces would more than likely take, and then draw them into killing areas where they would suffer disproportionate losses at the hands of anti-tank guided missile equipped infantry and tanks in hull-down defensive positions. The British division would keep on moving, fighting this aggressive delaying battle from the [[East German]] border.{{sfn|DeVore|2009|p=279}} The restructure saw the BAOR increase to four divisions, each with two armoured regiments and three mechanised battalions.{{sfn|Isby|1988|p=332}} It was believed that this attritional battle, using four divisions, would allow the BAOR to resist a Soviet advance and buy enough time for one of several contingencies: a diplomatic solution to be achieved; reinforcements to arrive to allow further conventional warfare; or a threat made warning of the use of tactical nuclear weapons.{{sfn|DeVore|2009|p=282}} On 1&nbsp;September 1976, as part of these reforms, the 2nd&nbsp;Division was re-designated as the 2nd&nbsp;Armoured Division.{{sfn|Kneen|Sutton|1996|p=183}}\n\n===History===\n[[File:Manby tank - geograph.org.uk - 466026.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Photograph of a Chieftain tank | The Chieftain tank, the main battle tank of the division.]]\n\nThe 2nd&nbsp;Armoured Division was the first of the four BAOR divisions to be reorganised. After the process was completed, it was 8,600 men strong, and equipped with 132 [[Chieftain (tank)|Chieftain]] tanks (with 12 additional tanks in reserve). In a time of war, the division would be reinforced to a wartime strength of 14,000 men.{{sfn|Dodd|1977|p=374}} Divisional headquarters was based in [[L\u00fcbbecke]], and its signal regiment was in [[B\u00fcnde]], Germany.{{sfn|Lord|Watson|2003|p=28}}{{sfn|Stone|1998|p=225}} The division consisted of an [[armoured reconnaissance]] regiment (two squadrons equipped with [[FV101 Scorpion]]s, and a third squadron equipped with [[FV107 Scimitar]]s); two armoured regiments each with 66 tanks spread over four squadrons; three [[mechanised infantry]] battalions, each with four rifle companies that were carried in [[FV432]] [[armoured personnel carrier]]s. The pre-reform organisation included pioneer and reconnaissance forces integrated within each infantry battalion. Now all reconnaissance forces were concentrated in the reconnaissance regiment, and all pioneers were allocated to the divisional engineer regiment. The division's artillery group included a close support regiment equipped with the [[FV433 Abbot SPG|Abbot]] [[self-propelled artillery]] system and [[Blowpipe (missile)|Blowpipe]] missiles, a [[man-portable air-defense system|man-portable air-defence system]]; a general support regiment of self-propelled [[M109&nbsp;howitzer]]s; and an anti-tank battery equipped with [[Swingfire]] anti-tank missiles. Other divisional assets included a [[Royal Army Medical Corps|field ambulance unit]], a [[Provost (military police)|provost]] company, a [[Royal Corps of Transport|transport regiment]], an [[Royal Army Ordnance Corps|ordnance company]], [[Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers|field workshop battalions]], and [[2 (Training) Regiment Army Air Corps|an aviation regiment]] of [[Military helicopter|scout helicopters]].{{sfn|Dodd|1977|p=374}} The actual units that comprised the division were not fixed. The British Army rotated units through the BAOR. For example, infantry battalions would generally serve a four-year tour with the army before being rotated to another theatre; armoured units could serve up to eight years.{{sfn|Hansen|1970|p=27}} Elements of the division could also be rotated elsewhere from Germany while remaining part of the division. For example, the 2nd Armoured Division Engineer Regiment was deployed to [[Northern Ireland]] in December 1979.<ref>{{Cite Hansard|house=House of Commons|title=Baor Units (Ulster Service)|url=https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/1979-12-19/debates/93da3177-a464-4615-b481-1643110f689d/BaorUnits(UlsterService)|date=19 December 1979|5=|accessdate=29 October 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20191029221321/https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/1979-12-19/debates/93da3177-a464-4615-b481-1643110f689d/BaorUnits(UlsterService)|archivedate=29 October 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nWith the removal of the brigade level, the division was ideally able to form up to five battlegroups each based around the headquarters of the armoured regiment or infantry battalions. These groups were to be formed for a specific task and allocated the required forces needed. The reforms envisioned that the divisional commander would oversee these battlegroups, but early training found this to be impractical. To compensate, the divisional headquarters was increased to 750 men (war time strength) including two brigadiers, who would each command a flexible task force that would be formed by the GOC.{{sfn|Dodd|1977|p=375}} The 2nd Armoured Division's task forces were Task Force Charlie and Task Force Delta. The task forces would allow the GOC to tailor their forces to meet unforeseen events and better execute the killing area doctrine.{{sfn|DeVore|2009|pp=281\u2013282}} These task forces were not a reintroduction of a brigade command structure, and they had no logistical responsibilities. Structuring the division in this manner allowed the division to be reduced by 700 men.{{sfn|Dodd|1977|p=375}} The historian [[David Stone (military historian)|David Stone]] commented the system was \"designed to allow the commander maximum flexibility and take precise account of the operational or tactical task to be achieved.\"{{sfn|Stone|1998|p=224}}\n\nIn November 1976, the BAOR held Exercise Spearpoint&nbsp;76. It was designed to test the reorganised 2nd&nbsp;Armoured Division, and included troops from Denmark and the United States.{{sfn|Dodd|1977|p=372}} Norman Dodd, a retired British Army officer who attended the exercise and reviewed what took place, wrote: \"Exercise Spearpoint proved that the new structure of the corps is workable and an improvement on the old organization.\" He suggested the new structure may see problems \"after some days in combat when fatigue and strain begin to take their toll\" on the divisional headquarters and those in charge of the battlegroups.{{sfn|Dodd|1977|p=378}} Following the exercise, further refinements to the organisation took place into 1977, as additional armour and infantry units were transferred and brought the formation up to strength.{{sfn|Kneen|Sutton|1996|p=183}} The Task Force concept lasted until the end of the decade. Stone wrote it had \"not prove[d] entirely satisfactory\".{{sfn|Stone|1998|p=224}} Isby wrote brigades were reintroduced after the flaws of the new system became apparent. It was an issue exacerbated by troop deployments to [[Ulster]] that had \"caused some armoured and mechanized battalions to reduce their fourth squadrons or companies to cadre status.\"{{sfn|Isby|1988|p=332}} The division now comprised the [[4th Infantry Brigade and Headquarters North East|4th]] and the [[12th Armoured Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|12th]]&nbsp;Armoured brigades.{{sfn|Kneen|Sutton|1996|p=185}}{{sfn|Stone|1998|p=222}}\n\n===End of the division===\nIn 1981, [[John Nott]], the [[Secretary of State for Defence]] for the government [[1979 United Kingdom general election|elected in 1979]], authored the [[1981 Defence White Paper]]. It, like the Mason review, aimed at balancing the British military inline with the nation's financial resources.{{sfn|Taylor|2010|p=7}} Nott's paper called for the BAOR to be restructured from four armoured divisions of two brigades to three divisions of three brigades, saving manpower and money with the loss one division. Nott also called for a new division to be formed in the United Kingdom, which would be made up primarily of [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] personnel. The new formation would reinforce the BAOR on the outbreak of war.{{sfn|Nott|1981|p=17}}\n\nIn July 1981, the 2nd&nbsp;Armoured Division was chosen to be the formation that would be disbanded in Germany. It was to be reformed in the United Kingdom as the 2nd&nbsp;Infantry Division and be assigned to reinforce the BAOR. The new division headquarters would be based at [[Imphal Barracks]], in [[York]].<ref>{{cite web|ref=harv|last=Blaker|first=Peter|year=1981|url=https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/written-answers/1981/jul/20/1br-corps|title=1(BR) Corps, Written Answers (Commons), HC Deb 20 July 1981 vol 9 cc57-8W|website=House of Commons Library: Historic Hansard|accessdate=October 28, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191111062804/https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/written-answers/1981/jul/20/1br-corps|archive-date=11 November 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The Division's assets were dispersed.

The division's creation had been discussed since the beginning of 1939, with the intent to form it by breaking up the [[1st (United Kingdom) Division|1st&nbsp;Armoured Division]]. A lack of tanks resulted in this not happening until December 1939. After its creation, the division was deprived of forces for a short while until elements of the 1st&nbsp;Armoured Division were assigned to it.\n\nIn early 1940, priority for equipment was given to the 1st&nbsp;Armoured Division and the 2nd&nbsp;Armoured Division was forced to make do with whatever equipment could be provided. After the [[Battle of France]], with the threat of a German invasion ([[Operation Sealion]]) of the United Kingdom, priority for equipment shifted to the 2nd&nbsp;Armoured Division. While it was brought up to strength, it was planned to use the division to [[counterattack|counter-attack]] the flanks of any invasion force. In August 1940, elements of the division were transported to Egypt to reinforce [[Middle East Command]]. In October, it was decided to transfer the rest of the division. Before leaving it swapped a brigade with 1st&nbsp;Armoured Division, reducing the division to three armoured regiments.\n\nThe division arrived in Egypt in December 1940, and in the following months was stripped to support an expeditionary force that was dispatched to Greece ([[Operation Lustre]]). The rest of the division moved to the conquered province of [[Cyrenaica]] in [[Italian Libya]]. Its tanks were worn-out, mechanically unreliable, and supplemented by captured Italian models that were equally unreliable. In March, a German-Italian counter-attack led to the destruction of the division and the ejection of most British forces from Cyrenaica. The consensus of historians is there was little the division could have done to stop this.\n\nThe division was not reformed until 1976, during the [[Cold War]], after the [[2nd Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|2nd&nbsp;Infantry Division]] was renamed. In case of war, the new 2nd&nbsp;Armoured Division, of the [[British Army of the Rhine]], was intended to fight a delaying battle against their armoured counterparts in the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[Red Army]]. In 1982, the division ceased to exist as it reverted to its infantry title.\n\n==Second World War==\n===Background===\nDuring the [[Interwar period]], the [[British Army]] examined the [[Lessons learned|lessons learnt]] from the [[First World War]]. This included experimentation and development of [[Military theory|theories]] of [[Maneuver warfare|manoeuvre]] and [[Armoured warfare|armoured]]-warfare, as well as the creation of the short-lived [[Experimental Mechanized Force]].{{sfn|French|2001|pp=28\u201329}} The long-term impact was for the Army to start to move towards [[mechanisation]] to restore battlefield mobility.{{sfn|French|2001|pp=36\u201337}} By the 1930s, the army had established three types of division: the infantry division, the mobile division (later called the armoured division), and the motor division. The military historian David French wrote: \"The main role of the infantry ... was to break into the enemy's defensive position\". This would then be exploited by the mobile division, followed by the motor divisions that would \"carry out the rapid consolidation of the ground captured by the mobile divisions\" therefore \"transform[ing] the 'break-in' into a '[[Breakthrough (military)|break-through]]{{'}}\".{{sfn|French|2001|pp=37\u201341}}\n\nThe [[1st (United Kingdom) Division|Mobile Division]] was created in October 1937.{{sfn|Perry|1988|p=45}} French wrote that it was \"'tank-heavy' ... with too few infantry and support arms. It had six cavalry [[light tank]] regiments ... three [[Medium tank|medium]] regiments ... two [[motorized infantry]] battalions and two artillery regiments. The mechanized cavalry were designed to [[reconnoitre]], not to fight, and the infantry were intended to protect the tanks when they were resting and replenishing.\"{{sfn|French|2001|p=42}} [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[John Burnett-Stuart]], responsible for training the Mobile Division, stated the infantry were not \"to be put on to a position by tanks and told to hold it, and they are not meant to fight side by side with your tanks in the forefront\". French wrote this \"stood outside the mainstream of official [[Military doctrine|doctrine]]\", which promoted [[combined-arms]] co-operation to win battles and placed the British armoured formations at odds with their German counterparts in the ''{{lang|de|[[Panzerwaffe]]}}'' (Tank Arm). They had \"concluded that tanks working on their own or merely in conjunction with infantry would never be a decisive weapon\" and that \"the key to success lay in combining tanks and supporting arms in the same divisional organization\". According to French, this thinking predominated within the British armoured forces, until doctrine was reformed in 1942.{{sfn|French|2001|p=42}}\n\nIn the 1930s, [[Causes of World War II|tensions built]] between [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and the United Kingdom and its [[Allies of World War II|allies]].{{sfn|Bell|1997|pp=3\u20134}} During late 1937 and 1938, German demands for the annexation of the [[Sudetenland]] in [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovakia]] led to an [[international crisis]]. This was resolved in September by the [[Munich Agreement]], which accepted that the Germans would annexe the Sudetenland.{{sfn|Bell|1997|pp=258\u2013275, 277\u2013278}} Tension did not subside, and the British Government debated how best to prepare the Army for war. In January 1939, the [[Secretary of State for War]] [[Leslie Hore-Belisha, 1st Baron Hore-Belisha|Leslie Hore-Belisha]] proposed splitting the Mobile Division into two smaller formations but found no support for this move.{{sfn|Gibbs|1976|pp=503\u2013504}} The issue was broached a month later and was accepted in principle by the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]].{{sfn|Gibbs|1976|p=511}} Shortly after, the French were informed of a preliminary timetable for the arrival of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) in the event of war: \"One Regular Armoured Division will become available about the middle of 1940, the second would not be available 'till a later date\". The formation of a second division during this period was complicated by the slow pace of tank production.{{sfn|Gibbs|1976|pp=514, 525}}\n\n===Formation and home service===\n[[File:IWM-ARMY-TRAINING-6-6-light-tank-MkVIA-c1937.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Photograph of a Vickers light tank with one soldier by the gun turret and another looking through an opening in the front | A Vickers light tank of the 3rd&nbsp;Hussars]]\n\nThe 2nd&nbsp;Armoured Division was activated on 15&nbsp;December 1939, with [[Major-General (United Kingdom)|Major-General]] [[Frederick Hotblack]] as the first [[General Officer Commanding]] (GOC).{{sfn|Joslen|2003|p=16}} Hotblack joined the [[Royal Tank Regiment|Royal Tank Corps]] in 1916.

It was also felt there was little threat until at least May (by which point, additional forces would be available to reinforce the Cyrenaica garrison). British strategy had shifted to support [[Greece]] and to maintain the status-quo in [[the Balkans]] without allowing additional countries to be overran by Germany or Italy.

However, [[Axis powers|Axis]] bombing had rendered it unusable for landing supplies for the 2nd&nbsp;Armoured Division, which therefore had to rely on overland routes back to [[Tobruk]]. A lack of transport meant the British Army had to create a series of static stockpiles to supply the forward area. This made it impossible to supply a garrison west of [[El Agheila]], which was the most favourable position for a defensive line. It also restricted the mobility of the 2nd&nbsp;Armoured Division, which could not move beyond the range of their supply dumps.{{sfn|Playfair|Flynn|Molony|Toomer|2004b|pp=4\u20136}} [[Lieutenant-General (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-General]] [[Philip Neame]], GOC [[List of British Commands and Army groups|Cyrenaica Command]], arrived in Libya to find his command lacked staff and signal equipment for mobile operations.

Neame believed his position was untenable without a fully equipped armoured division supported by two complete infantry divisions and adequate air support. The only other major formation available to Neame was the [[9th Division (Australia)|9th&nbsp;Australian Division]]. It was under-equipped, under-trained, and lacked direct communication with the 2nd&nbsp;Armoured Division. One of the 9th&nbsp;Australian Division's brigades remained at Tobruk. The other two were positioned well to the north of Benghazi to hold the high ground of the [[Jebel Akhdar, Libya|Jebel Akhdar]]. Neame was ordered to give ground if attacked, as the conservation of his force was more important. The 2nd&nbsp;Armoured Division had the conflicting objectives of avoiding tank losses while being ready to operate against the flanks of any Axis armoured force. The 3rd&nbsp;Armoured Brigade was based south-east of [[Mersa Brega]], where the Support Group was located. Once operations got underway, Neame also predicted the 2nd&nbsp;Armoured Division's tank numbers would rapidly dwindle due to breakdowns.{{sfn|Playfair|Flynn|Molony|Toomer|2004b|pp=1\u20139}}{{sfn|Carver|2002|p=19}}\n\n===Axis offensive===\n====March====\n{{further|Operation Sonnenblume}}\n[[File:The British Army in North Africa 1941 E2687.jpg|thumb|right|alt= Photograph if a German Panzer III tank | An example of the German Panzer III, the most common tank in the German Afrika Korps during this period.]]\n\nItaly had responded to Compass by redeploying their [[Fifth Army (Italy)|5th&nbsp;Army]] from the border with [[French protectorate of Tunisia|French Tunisia]] towards Cyrenaica, and by dispatching the [[132nd Armoured Division Ariete|132nd Armoured Division ''Ariete'']] and the [[102 Motorised Division Trento|102nd Motorised Division''Trento'']].{{sfn|Playfair|Flynn|Molony|Toomer|2004b|p=14}}{{sfn|Bauer|2000|p=121}} In addition, Germany had dispatched the [[Afrika Korps]] (the [[21st Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|5th&nbsp;Light]] and [[15th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|15th&nbsp;Panzer Divisions]]) under the command of ''[[Generalleutnant]]'' [[Erwin Rommel]].

Then only two of them could be used extensively due to the expected strain on the supply line. British [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) aerial reconnaissance had observed Axis troop movements towards Cyrenaica, and on 25&nbsp;February spotted German ''[[Schwerer Panzersp\u00e4hwagen]]'' (eight-wheeler armoured cars).

A patrol of two armoured cars from the KDG, supported by a single anti-tank gun attached from the 9th&nbsp;Australian Division, spotted and engaged their German reconnaissance counterparts near El Agheila. The Axis force withdrew after the Australians claimed three vehicles knocked out. The following day, a platoon from the 1st&nbsp;Tower Hamlet Rifles moved forward to ensure that the colonial fort near El Agheila was still unoccupied, before moving to take up an ambush position to the west of the town. Nearing the fort, they found it occupied and came under fire. Shortly afterwards, German armoured cars moved forward. A brief clash occurred that resulted in one German armoured car being knocked out, and an Australian gun crew suffering casualties. After this brief action, the British screening force withdrew to Mersa Brega ceding El Agheila to the Axis.

During the afternoon, the withdrawal was further slowed by breakdowns, conflicting orders, as well as the need to rest and refuel allowing the nearby armoured vehicles to gain ground. Two [[troop]]s from the 5th&nbsp;RTR were ordered to conduct a rearguard action and took [[hull-down]] positions.{{sfn|Jentz|1998|pp=92\u201393}}\n\nThe 5th&nbsp;RTR decided the shadowing tanks were Italian (they were German).

An attached Australian anti-tank gun fired on both trucks, halting them. The Axis soldiers, one German and twenty Italians, dismounted and were soon captured by a patrol of the 11th&nbsp;PAVO. Another patrol by the brigade captured another Italian prisoner, who had been directing artillery fire on the fort. The 11th&nbsp;PAVO captured more Axis troops during the day while patrolling the perimeter.{{sfn|Maughan|1966|pp=84, 89}} Neame, unaware of the attack, set off into the desert to locate Gambier-Parry to deliver new instructions.

Following the new instructions, the Support Group moved north towards the coastal road to withdraw towards Gazala via Derna. The divisional headquarters, including Gambier-Parry and a battery of artillery, continued towards Mechili. The 3rd&nbsp;Armoured Brigade turned north for [[Marawa, Libya|Maraura]] due to a lack of fuel but found little petrol there.

By dawn, the 2nd&nbsp;Support Group and the 3rd&nbsp;Armoured Brigade were stretched out, largely stuck in traffic west of Derna and as far back as [[Slonta]] (north of Mechili). The Tower Hamlet Rifles were positioned guarding the western end of the Giovanni Berta pass, near Derna. Gambier-Perry and the 3rd&nbsp;Indian Motor Brigade had been surrounded at Mechili.{{sfn|Maughan|1966|pp=94\u201395}} Axis armoured cars had penetrated as far as [[Timimi]] (near Gazala) and ambushed some retreating Australian forces. They were repulsed following the fortunate appearance of a 5th&nbsp;RTR cruiser tank that had been separated from the rest of the regiment.{{sfn|Maughan|1966|pp=95\u201396}} At 10:00, after elements of the division had passed through Derna, a squadron of the KDG were detached to guard the Derna airfield ({{convert|6|mi|km|abbr=off}} south of the town) to help keep the inland road open. Elements of the Tower Hamlet Rifles were nearby. By 14:30, the 5th&nbsp;RTR, now down to four tanks due to mechanical breakdowns, was the last of the divisional tank units to arrive near the airfield; they formed a rearguard. During the early afternoon, the KDG were engaged in a prolonged fight with the vanguard of the Axis forces. Around 15:00, the KDG and some infantry were ordered to withdraw and inadvertently isolated other parts of the rearguard, including the 5th&nbsp;RTR.{{sfn|Playfair|Flynn|Molony|Toomer|2004b|p=29}}{{sfn|Maughan|1966|pp=97\u201398}}\n\n[[Lieutenant colonel (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-Colonel]] [[Henry Dinham Drew|Henry Drew]], commander of the 5th&nbsp;RTR, led the rearguard of his four tanks, elements of the Tower Hamlet Rifles, some anti-tank guns, and elements of the 7th&nbsp;Armoured Division that had been moved up (A&nbsp;Company, 1st&nbsp;Battalion, King's Royal Rifle Corps; and J&nbsp;Battery, 3rd&nbsp;Royal Horse Artillery).{{sfn|Playfair|Flynn|Molony|Toomer|2004b|p=29}}{{sfn|Maughan|1966|pp=97\u201398}}{{sfn|Joslen|2003|p=218}} Around 16:00, German forces at the airfield moved to secure the road and attacked towards Drew's forces.

As the four tanks advanced towards the German positions, fifty other vehicles containing the rearguard (including some Australian forces) moved off. While some vehicles were knocked out, the tanks were able to keep the German forces busy enough to allow the rest to move past the area after which they dispersed; the four tanks were lost.{{sfn|Maughan|1966|p=99}} Barton Maughan, author of the Australian official history for this period of the fighting, wrote \"by coincidence ... the 5th&nbsp;Royal Tanks ... [were] where they were most needed and could be most effectively employed that day\".{{sfn|Maughan|1966|p=99}} The British official history recorded \"the action cleared the road also for any troops that remained in Derna\" as well as allowing the force to break away.{{sfn|Playfair|Flynn|Molony|Toomer|2004b|p=29}}\n\n===Surrender===\n\nAt Mechili, on 7&nbsp;April, the Germans continued to build up their forces surrounding the division's position. At dawn, elements of the 3rd&nbsp;Indian Motor Brigade, supported by a battery of guns, launched a minor and unsuccessful road on the Axis positions. It resulted in the loss of two guns, along with one man killed and another wounded. At 11:00, Axis guns opened fire from a nearby ridge. A small detachment of troops in a truck with a [[Vickers machine gun]] moved out of the division's position and attempted to move close to the guns to capture them. They were unable to get close enough to attack. The shelling continued, damaging vehicles but inflicting few casualties. The Germans sent an officer to demand surrender. Gambier-Parry rebuffed this demand, as he believed the German to be bluffing to hide their weakened force and position.{{sfn|Playfair|Flynn|Molony|Toomer|2004b|p=30}}{{sfn|Maughan|1966|p=102}} In the afternoon, Italian forces launched a minor attack on the positions held by the 2nd&nbsp;Lancers and were repulsed. Several Italians were captured along with two anti-tank guns. Axis forces subsequently bombarded the division's positions for thirty minutes. At some point during the day, contemporary sources differ on times, 'A'&nbsp;Squadron, 18th&nbsp;Cavalry entered the Mechili perimeter having skirmished with Axis armoured cars en route.{{sfn|Maughan|1966|p=102}} In the evening, a second German officer approached the division to demand surrender and was also refused by Gambier-Perry.{{sfn|Playfair|Flynn|Molony|Toomer|2004b|p=30}}{{sfn|Maughan|1966|p=102}} This refusal was followed by an artillery bombardment, machine-gun fire, and some skirmishing between patrols outside the main positions. Previously Gambier-Perry had been out of contact with Cyrenaica Command. Around 22:00, communication was re-established, and Gambier-Perry was informed that the rest of his division would not be joining him nor any other reinforcements. He was ordered to break-out at first light and head for El Adem.{{sfn|Maughan|1966|p=103}}\n\nThe break-out was to be led by one squadron of the 18th&nbsp;Cavalry along with a single cruiser tank, which belonged to the divisional headquarters. This [[vanguard]] was to attack east towards the Axis defensive positions before dawn, to negate their anti-tank gun defensive capability. This eastward move, towards the strongest Axis positions, would be followed by a column formed from the brigade and divisional headquarters. This, in turn, would be followed by engineers, and then all other remaining personnel. The 11th&nbsp;PAVO would provide flank protection, and the 2nd&nbsp;Lancers would form the rearguard of the column. The anti-tank guns were spread out among the column's various units. It was hoped this attack would break through the position and provide a direct retreat route, avoiding the need to drive deeper into the desert, on a meandering route and through difficult terrain, to bypass Axis forces.{{sfn|Maughan|1966|pp=103\u2013104}} Maughan wrote, \"If the original plan had been adhered to, if it had been boldly executed, a great measure of success might have been achieved. But the operation miscarried badly\".{{sfn|Maughan|1966|p=104}} \n\nThe tank did not arrive on time, and the attack was delayed to allow it to move up to the start line. This resulted in the loss of the cover of dark. Despite this, 24 vehicles of the 18th&nbsp;Cavalry achieved surprised charging the Italian battery of 12&nbsp;guns. The Indians dismounted and attacked at bayonet point, scattering the battery's personnel for the loss of at least two dead and 15 wounded. With their mission achieved, they remounted their vehicles and proceeded with the escape plan. Instead of following up this move, the rest of the escape column awaited the cruiser to advance. The 11th&nbsp;PAVO attacked and a large portion of their force broke through the Axis defensive positions followed by the 3rd&nbsp;Indian Motor Brigade headquarters. The main body followed the cruiser, which moved towards the gun battery previously silenced by the 18th&nbsp;Cavalry. The Italians, having recovered from the shock of the attack, had returned to their guns. They engaged and destroyed the tank, resulting in the death of the entire crew. Now alert to the British attack, Axis guns from around the Mechili perimeter opened fire. The artillery and heavy machine gun fire hindered the ability of the division's non-armoured vehicles to attempt a break-out. This was followed by an attack by Axis infantry and German tanks. Two Australian anti-tank guns, part of the rearguard, opened fire in a fierce battle with the German tanks, but were unable to stop their attack; the majority of the crews were killed or wounded.{{sfn|Playfair|Flynn|Molony|Toomer|2004b|p=30}}{{sfn|Maughan|1966|pp=104\u2013107}} \n\nVaughan, who had broken out, returned towards Mechili to aid the extradition of the 2nd&nbsp;Lancers. There was discussion of a break-out to the south or the west, however, Gambier-Perry made the decision to surrender to spare the men in the non-armoured vehicles from suffering unnecessary casualties. His surrender was not immediately known to all forces still in the Mechili perimeter due to a sandstorm. However, by 08:00 all fighting had ceased. Elements of the garrison refused to capitulate, in particular 'M'&nbsp;battery 3rd&nbsp;RHA and portions of the 2nd&nbsp;Lancers who, with non-armoured vehicles, charged the Axis positions and pushed through them without a fight. Eventually, most of these troops were able to make it back to Allied lines at Tobruk, some taking prisoners en route. Those who did not attempt to escape were captured along with Gambier-Perry and Vaughan. In total, around 3,000 prisoners were taken.{{sfn|Playfair|Flynn|Molony|Toomer|2004b|p=30}}{{sfn|Maughan|1966|pp=107\u2013108}}<p>\nThe remnants of 6th&nbsp;RTR, 'C'&nbsp;Squadron, which had failed to reach Derna before it was taken, moved south into the desert to avoid Axis forces. They continued to move east, before meeting British reconnaissance forces near El Adem on 10&nbsp;April. They had been reduced to a force of four trucks. From there, they were escorted into Tobruk, reaching the port an hour before midnight.{{sfn|Maughan|1966|p=100}} On 10&nbsp;May 1941, the 2nd&nbsp;Armoured Division was officially disbanded.{{sfn|Joslen|2003|p=16}}\n\n===Assessment===\n\nMaughan wrote, \"at what great risk and cost had these tanks been shipped across the seas from England to the Middle East! Churchill's courage, energy and determination in sending munitions to Wavell had been frustrated because others failed to ensure that the equipment sent was at least battle-worthy.\"{{sfn|Maughan|1966|p=100}} A contemporary [[after action report]], by surviving senior officers from the division, noted \"this division had not, in fact, had an opportunity for adequate training as a team. It was a collection of units, three of which had only joined shortly before the action, rather than a trained formation. The breakdown in control and administration was largely due to this fact\".{{sfn|French|2001|p=227}} Gambier-Parry was described as \"a conventional and slow minded soldier who couldn't cope with the unexpected\". David French describes the critique as harsh; the divisional commander \"was not a cavalryman\" and had transferred from the infantry to the Royal Tank Corps.{{sfn|French|2001|p=231}} French looked at \"the ineptitude of [the division's] undertrained staff\", as well as a lack of logistical support. \"[T]he disaster that overtook [the division] was in part caused by the fact that it had no railhead and could not be provided with sufficient motor transport to enable it to build up a sufficient reserve of supplies some {{convert|350|mi|}} from the nearest base.\"{{sfn|French|2001|p=117, 231}}\n\nThe [[Field Marshal (United Kingdom)|field marshal]] and historian [[Michael Carver, Baron Carver|Michael Carver]] wrote \"a combination of long delays in communications, resulting in misunderstandings and changes in orders, and a general breakdown of the logistical organization within [the division], led to a collapse of any effective resistance\".{{sfn|Carver|2002|p=21}} In reviewing the defeat, including the loss of the division, Carver noted it, \"must be attributed to failure to face realities at every level. The general state of the force, in terms of training, professional competence, logistical supply and serviceability of equipment, meant that it was no match for its opponent\".{{sfn|Carver|2002|p=22}} The general and historian [[David Fraser (British Army officer)|David Fraser]] wrote, once \"the Germans chose to drive across the chord of the Cyrenaican arc there was little to stop them\", as the 2nd&nbsp;Armoured Division \"had little fighting capacity left as a coherent formation of all arms\" following the extensive breakdown of equipment. Had it been able to fight, Fraser criticised a chain of command that would have hindered its ability; the 3rd&nbsp;Armoured Brigade \"was subjected to the orders of ... Gambier-Parry; ... Neame; ... Wavell\" and O'Connor.{{sfn|Fraser|1999|p=151}}\n\nThe historian Thomas Jentz argues that, considering the mechanical state of their tanks, the 2nd&nbsp;Armoured Division \"didn't have anything to lose in conducting ambush counter-attacks\" against their Axis opponents \"as recommended in their tactical manual. At no time [was the division] a threat or a hindrance to the advancing German-Italian forces\" largely as a result of how they were \"tactically handled\".{{sfn|Jentz|1998|p=101}} Jentz lauded the courage of the tank crews, but criticised their inflexible attitude towards combat and especially manoeuvre, which required permission from the next level in the chain of command to move even one tank. Jentz argued that this lack of flexibility, mixed with a lack of alternative firing positions, explained the rapid tank losses that occurred when the division did engage their opponents. Jentz also criticised the Germans, who showed an equal lack of flexibility against their own doctrine. This resulted in the two sides lining up to fire at one another rather than manoeuvring. The lack of understanding on the Germans' part about the intention of the 2nd&nbsp;Armoured Division resulted in the 5th Light Division being \"decimated by mechanical breakdowns\" due to \"unnecessarily rushing through the desert\", a move that resulted in 83 tanks having to be sent to workshops.{{sfn|Jentz|1998|pp=101\u2013102}}\n\n==Cold War==\n===Background===\nAt the end of the Second World War, the United Kingdom was allocated an [[Allied-occupied Germany|occupation zone]] in northwest Germany. It formed the [[British Army of the Rhine]] (BAOR) to administer its occupation forces. Following the creation of [[West Germany]], the BAOR ceased being an occupation force and became part of the UK's [[Northern Army Group|contribution to the defence]] of [[Western Europe]] from the [[Soviet Union]].{{sfn|Isby|1988|p=336}}{{sfn|Speiser|2016|p=1}} This role was reaffirmed at the 1954 [[London and Paris Conferences]], with the promise to commit four divisions to the defence of Europe.{{sfn|Rees|2013|p=57}} While the BAOR fluctuated in size and the number of divisions, it was founded with and maintained the [[2nd Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|2nd&nbsp;Infantry Division]] throughout this period.{{sfn|Isby|1988|p=336}} By the 1960s, the BAOR had been reduced to three divisions. The division's brigades had adopted a [[Square division|square organisation]]; each consisted of two armoured battalions and two mechanised infantry battalions.{{sfn|Isby|1988|p=331}}\n\n[[File:British 2nd Infantry Division.svg|thumb|left|alt=Illustration of the 2nd&nbsp;Division's divisional insignia\u2014two old keys | The divisional insignia of the 2nd&nbsp;Division, since its adoption during the Second World War, and used throughout the Cold War and during the period as an armoured division.{{sfn|Lord|Watson|2003|p=28}}{{sfn|Horseman|Shaw|1983|p=126}}]]\n\nBy the 1970s, the UK was in the position of having to reconcile decreasing resources with its commitments and the increased threat of the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Isby|1988|p=332}} In 1974, following the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|general election]], [[Roy Mason]] became [[Secretary of State]]. He authored the [[Mason Review]], a Government [[White paper]] outlining the new defence policy. It reaffirmed the Soviet Union as the primary threat to British national security and the need to concentrate its forces in Western Europe.{{sfn|Taylor|2010|pp=6\u20137}} Mason argued for proposed changes that would \"maintain as far as possible the present combat capability of the Army in Europe ... while reducing the overall number of men\".{{sfn|Mason|1975|p=I-22}} This would be achieved by disbanding headquarter units, including the elimination of \"the brigade level of command\" with battalions being \"commanded directly by smaller-sized divisional headquarters\". The overall aim was to have \"fewer formation headquarters overall, and fewer but larger units\".{{sfn|Mason|1975|p=I-23}} These changes were to maintain the BAOR's ability to wage \"a mobile and intense armoured battle\" against invading Soviet forces.{{sfn|Mason|1975|pp=III=8\u20139}}\n\nHistorian David Isby wrote that Mason's reforms were promised \"with an alleged 25 percent increase in combat power\".{{sfn|Isby|1988|p=332}} This increase was to be brought about by more efficient use of manpower, streamlining the logistical elements of the division and improving the ratio of weapons and men.{{sfn|Dodd|1977|p=373}} Historian Marc Donald DeVore argued the politically forced change coincided with BAOR doctrinal changes that had started in the 1960s. They were subsequently pioneered by the 1st&nbsp;Armoured Division in the early 1970s: to fight a mobile defensive battle by defending key attack routes that Soviet armoured forces would more than likely take, and then draw them into killing areas where they would suffer disproportionate losses at the hands of anti-tank guided missile equipped infantry and tanks in hull-down defensive positions. The British division would keep on moving, fighting this aggressive delaying battle from the [[East German]] border.{{sfn|DeVore|2009|p=279}} The restructure saw the BAOR increase to four divisions, each with two armoured regiments and three mechanised battalions.{{sfn|Isby|1988|p=332}} It was believed that this attritional battle, using four divisions, would allow the BAOR to resist a Soviet advance and buy enough time for one of several contingencies: a diplomatic solution to be achieved; reinforcements to arrive to allow further conventional warfare; or a threat made warning of the use of tactical nuclear weapons.{{sfn|DeVore|2009|p=282}} On 1&nbsp;September 1976, as part of these reforms, the 2nd&nbsp;Division was re-designated as the 2nd&nbsp;Armoured Division.{{sfn|Kneen|Sutton|1996|p=183}}\n\n===History===\n[[File:Manby tank - geograph.org.uk - 466026.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Photograph of a Chieftain tank | The Chieftain tank, the main battle tank of the division.]]\n\nThe 2nd&nbsp;Armoured Division was the first of the four BAOR divisions to be reorganised. After the process was completed, it was 8,600 men strong, and equipped with 132 [[Chieftain (tank)|Chieftain]] tanks (with 12 additional tanks in reserve). In a time of war, the division would be reinforced to a wartime strength of 14,000 men.{{sfn|Dodd|1977|p=374}} Divisional headquarters was based in [[L\u00fcbbecke]], and its signal regiment was in [[B\u00fcnde]], Germany.{{sfn|Lord|Watson|2003|p=28}}{{sfn|Stone|1998|p=225}} The division consisted of an [[armoured reconnaissance]] regiment (two squadrons equipped with [[FV101 Scorpion]]s, and a third squadron equipped with [[FV107 Scimitar]]s); two armoured regiments each with 66 tanks spread over four squadrons; three [[mechanised infantry]] battalions, each with four rifle companies that were carried in [[FV432]] [[armoured personnel carrier]]s. The pre-reform organisation included pioneer and reconnaissance forces integrated within each infantry battalion. Now all reconnaissance forces were concentrated in the reconnaissance regiment, and all pioneers were allocated to the divisional engineer regiment. The division's artillery group included a close support regiment equipped with the [[FV433 Abbot SPG|Abbot]] [[self-propelled artillery]] system and [[Blowpipe (missile)|Blowpipe]] missiles, a [[man-portable air-defense system|man-portable air-defence system]]; a general support regiment of self-propelled [[M109&nbsp;howitzer]]s; and an anti-tank battery equipped with [[Swingfire]] anti-tank missiles. Other divisional assets included a [[Royal Army Medical Corps|field ambulance unit]], a [[Provost (military police)|provost]] company, a [[Royal Corps of Transport|transport regiment]], an [[Royal Army Ordnance Corps|ordnance company]], [[Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers|field workshop battalions]], and [[2 (Training) Regiment Army Air Corps|an aviation regiment]] of [[Military helicopter|scout helicopters]].{{sfn|Dodd|1977|p=374}} The actual units that comprised the division were not fixed. The British Army rotated units through the BAOR. For example, infantry battalions would generally serve a four-year tour with the army before being rotated to another theatre; armoured units could serve up to eight years.{{sfn|Hansen|1970|p=27}} Elements of the division could also be rotated elsewhere from Germany while remaining part of the division. For example, the 2nd Armoured Division Engineer Regiment was deployed to [[Northern Ireland]] in December 1979.<ref>{{Cite Hansard|house=House of Commons|title=Baor Units (Ulster Service)|url=https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/1979-12-19/debates/93da3177-a464-4615-b481-1643110f689d/BaorUnits(UlsterService)|date=19 December 1979|5=|accessdate=29 October 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20191029221321/https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/1979-12-19/debates/93da3177-a464-4615-b481-1643110f689d/BaorUnits(UlsterService)|archivedate=29 October 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nWith the removal of the brigade level, the division was ideally able to form up to five battlegroups each based around the headquarters of the armoured regiment or infantry battalions. These groups were to be formed for a specific task and allocated the required forces needed. The reforms envisioned that the divisional commander would oversee these battlegroups, but early training found this to be impractical. To compensate, the divisional headquarters was increased to 750 men (war time strength) including two brigadiers, who would each command a flexible task force that would be formed by the GOC.{{sfn|Dodd|1977|p=375}} The 2nd Armoured Division's task forces were Task Force Charlie and Task Force Delta. The task forces would allow the GOC to tailor their forces to meet unforeseen events and better execute the killing area doctrine.{{sfn|DeVore|2009|pp=281\u2013282}} These task forces were not a reintroduction of a brigade command structure, and they had no logistical responsibilities. Structuring the division in this manner allowed the division to be reduced by 700 men.{{sfn|Dodd|1977|p=375}} The historian [[David Stone (military historian)|David Stone]] commented the system was \"designed to allow the commander maximum flexibility and take precise account of the operational or tactical task to be achieved.\"{{sfn|Stone|1998|p=224}}\n\nIn November 1976, the BAOR held Exercise Spearpoint&nbsp;76. It was designed to test the reorganised 2nd&nbsp;Armoured Division, and included troops from Denmark and the United States.{{sfn|Dodd|1977|p=372}} Norman Dodd, a retired British Army officer who attended the exercise and reviewed what took place, wrote: \"Exercise Spearpoint proved that the new structure of the corps is workable and an improvement on the old organization.\" He suggested the new structure may see problems \"after some days in combat when fatigue and strain begin to take their toll\" on the divisional headquarters and those in charge of the battlegroups.{{sfn|Dodd|1977|p=378}} Following the exercise, further refinements to the organisation took place into 1977, as additional armour and infantry units were transferred and brought the formation up to strength.{{sfn|Kneen|Sutton|1996|p=183}} The Task Force concept lasted until the end of the decade. Stone wrote it had \"not prove[d] entirely satisfactory\".{{sfn|Stone|1998|p=224}} Isby wrote brigades were reintroduced after the flaws of the new system became apparent. It was an issue exacerbated by troop deployments to [[Ulster]] that had \"caused some armoured and mechanized battalions to reduce their fourth squadrons or companies to cadre status.\"{{sfn|Isby|1988|p=332}} The division now comprised the [[4th Infantry Brigade and Headquarters North East|4th]] and the [[12th Armoured Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|12th]]&nbsp;Armoured brigades.{{sfn|Kneen|Sutton|1996|p=185}}{{sfn|Stone|1998|p=222}}\n\n===End of the division===\nIn 1981, [[John Nott]], the [[Secretary of State for Defence]] for the government [[1979 United Kingdom general election|elected in 1979]], authored the [[1981 Defence White Paper]]. It, like the Mason review, aimed at balancing the British military inline with the nation's financial resources.{{sfn|Taylor|2010|p=7}} Nott's paper called for the BAOR to be restructured from four armoured divisions of two brigades to three divisions of three brigades, saving manpower and money with the loss one division. Nott also called for a new division to be formed in the United Kingdom, which would be made up primarily of [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] personnel. The new formation would reinforce the BAOR on the outbreak of war.{{sfn|Nott|1981|p=17}}\n\nIn July 1981, the 2nd&nbsp;Armoured Division was chosen to be the formation that would be disbanded in Germany. It was to be reformed in the United Kingdom as the 2nd&nbsp;Infantry Division and be assigned to reinforce the BAOR. The new division headquarters would be based at [[Imphal Barracks]], in [[York]].<ref>{{cite web|ref=harv|last=Blaker|first=Peter|year=1981|url=https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/written-answers/1981/jul/20/1br-corps|title=1(BR) Corps, Written Answers (Commons), HC Deb 20 July 1981 vol 9 cc57-8W|website=House of Commons Library: Historic Hansard|accessdate=October 28, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191111062804/https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/written-answers/1981/jul/20/1br-corps|archive-date=11 November 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The Division's assets were dispersed.

The media members are asked to vote for who they feel are the top fighters in the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]] by [[Mixed martial arts weight classes|weight class]] and [[Pound for pound|pound-for-pound]]. A fighter is only eligible to be voted on if they are in active status in the UFC. A fighter can appear in more than one weight division at a time. The champion and interim champion are considered to be in the top positions of their respective divisions and therefore are not eligible for voting by weight class. However, the champions can be voted on for the pound-for-pound rankings.<ref>[https://www.ufc.com/rankings UFC.com: Rankings]</ref>\n\n== Overview ==\n* Last update (current ranking): March 17,

rankings''', which were introduced in February 2013, are generated by a voting panel made up of media members. The media members are asked to vote for who they feel are the top fighters in the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]] by [[Mixed martial arts weight classes|weight class]] and [[Pound for pound|pound-for-pound]]. A fighter is only eligible to be voted on if they are in active status in the UFC. A fighter can appear in more than one weight division at a time. The champion and interim champion are considered to be in the top positions of their respective divisions and therefore are not eligible for voting by weight class. However, the champions can be voted on for the pound-for-pound rankings.<ref>[https://www.ufc.com/rankings UFC.com: Rankings]</ref>\n\n== Overview ==\n* Last update (current ranking): March 17,

However, [[Early modern Europe]] witnessed the turning point in the '''history of Christian thought on persecution and tolerance'''. Christian writers like [[John Milton]] and [[John Locke]] argued for limited religious toleration, while some Christians eventually came to support the concept of [[Freedom of religion|religious freedom]] which was developed by deists like [[Thomas Jefferson]].

Christianity's definition and practice of tolerance/intolerance were influenced by that persecution in a largely negative way. However, according to Guy Stroumsa, there is still a history in early Christian thought of tolerance as a concept, though not a fully developed one, and with some ambivalence, presenting both inclusivity and inventing the concept of heresy in Christian thought. <ref name=\"Stroumsa\">{{cite book|last=Stroumsa|first=Guy|editor1=Graham N.Stanton|editor2=Guy G.

At the same time a Germanic tribe, the Lombards, were gaining in Italy, another Germanic  tribe, the Franks were establishing their rule in what had been Roman Gaul and would become modern France. Clovis the first, a convert to Latin Christianity, became the first important ruler of  the Merovingian dynasty. He supported missionaries in newly conquered territories and strengthened ties with the Pope. After 700, the Merovongians gradually lost control of the kingdom to the Carolingians.  In 754, the Pope traveled to St.Denis, near Paris, to crown Pepin the Short king and name him defender of the faith. In exchange, Pepin crushed the Lombards and gave their land to the Pope. This alliance suited both parties, and redirected the church's interest away from the East, linking Rome's destiny with the West.<ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|198-199}}\n\nConstantine used forced conversion and his Bishop Alcuin wrote him a rebuke against it.<ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|200-201}}\n\nThe crusades evidence a dramatic shift in Christian thought on tolerance and persecution.\n\n====High Middle Ages====\n\nFeudalism declined and persecution changed during the High Middle Ages as kings began centralizing power into themselves and the state.  Under feudalism, a noble Lord gave military support to his king, but when so many nobles sold or leased their land and left for the East on crusade, kings began building armies of mercenaries for themselves and taking over legal processes that had traditionally been local. This process led to the development of persecution of minorities between the tenth to the thirteenth centuries in Europe.<ref name =\"Moor\">{{cite book|last=Moore|first=R.

There were massacres of Muslims and Jews when Jerusalem was taken by Crusaders in 1099.\n\n====Late Middle Ages====\nAfter [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] and later the [[Tsardom of Russia|Tsardom]] had conquered the [[Kazan Khanate]] and [[Astrakhan Khanate]] in the 1550s, the [[History of Tatarstan|government forcibly baptized]] Muslim [[Volga Tatars]] and pagan [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]], [[Mordva]] and [[Mari people|Mari]]. Mosques were prohibited. This persecution ended only under the reign of [[Catherine II of Russia]] in the late eighteenth century.\n\nThe [[Northern Crusades]], a series of campaigns against the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of northeastern Europe, faced fierce pagan resistance, requiring decades of violence by dedicated [[Teutonic Order|warrior-monks]] to force the submission, and compel the conversion, of the region's inhabitants, who were often left as serfs to an imported Christian [[Baltic Germans|German-speaking nobility]].<ref>Christiansen, Eric. The Northern Crusades. London: Penguin Books. pg. 14-15.</ref> There were often severe consequences for populations that chose to resist; for example, the Christian conquest and conversion of Old Prussia resulted in the death of much of the native population, whose [[Old Prussian|language]] subsequently became extinct.<ref name=\"The German Hansa page 34\">The German Hansa, P. Dollinger, page 34, 1999, Routledge</ref>\n  \nThe [[Spanish Inquisition|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Inquisition]] also went on to persecute Jews and Muslims. In Spain after the [[Reconquista]], Jews were forced to either convert or be exiled. Many were killed. The persecution of Jews goes back to 12th-century Visigothic Spain after the emergence of the [[blood libel against Jews]]. Although the Spanish had agreed to allow Muslims the freedom of religion in 1492, this was often ignored. In 1501, Muslims were offered the choice of conversion or exile. In 1556, Arab or Muslim dress was forbidden, and in 1566 Arabic language as a whole was prohibited in Spain.<ref>{{cite book | last = Lapidus | first =  Ira M. | title = A History of Islamic societes | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1988 | isbn = 0-521-22552-3| page = 389}}</ref> Jews were eventually expelled from England by King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], too.\n\n====Reformation Era====\n\nWhen [[Martin Luther]] wrote his [[The Ninety-Five Theses|Ninety-Five Theses]] in 1517, Catholicism reacted the same way as it had to the heresies of the late Middle Ages. However, while the [[Protestant Reformation]] could be \"crushed\" in Spain with \"a few dozen executions in the 1550s\",<ref>Coffey 2000: 212</ref> the same strategy failed in Germany, Northern Europe and in England. France had to suffer through the [[French Wars of Religion]] before it again became wholly Catholic. The divide between [[Catholicism]] and  the new [[Protestantism|Protestant denominations]] was deep. Protestants commonly alleged that the catholic [[Pope]] was the [[Antichrist]]. Conflicts between Christian factions reached their heights in France with the 1572 [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]], in Germany and [[Central Europe]] with the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648) and in England with the [[English Civil War]] (1641\u20131651). Following the devastations caused by these wars, the ideas of [[religious toleration]], [[freedom of religion]] and [[religious pluralism]] slowly gained ground in Europe. The [[Witch trials in Early Modern Europe]], which had reached their height between 1550 and 1650, continued until 1750.\n\n====Early Modern Era====\n\nEuropean [[Colonialism]], that was accompanied by Christian evangelism and often by violence, led to the suppression of [[Folk religion|indigenous religions]] in the territories conquered or usurped by the Europeans. The [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] largely destroyed the [[Aztec]] and [[Inca civilization]]. However, Colonialism (and later European [[Imperialism]]) as a whole were not motivated by religious zeal; the suppression of the indigenous religions was their side result, not their main purpose. Only partial aspects, like the [[Goa Inquisition]], bear resemblance to the persecutions that occurred on the European continent. By the 18th century, persecutions of unsanctioned beliefs had been reduced in most Europeans countries to [[religious discrimination]], in the form of legal restrictions on those who did not accept the official faith. This often included being barred from higher education, or from participation in the national legislature. In colonized nations, attempts to convert native peoples to Christianity became more encouraging and less forceful. In British India during the Victorian era, Christian converts were given preferential treatment for governmental appointments.\n\n====Modern Era====\nAt the present time, most countries in which Christianity is the religion of the majority of the people, are either [[secular state]]s or they embrace the [[separation of Church and State]] in another way. (A list of countries in which Christianity is still the state religion can be found in the article on [[State religion]].) Some recent political conflicts are sometimes considered [[religious persecution]]s.

Literature was eclectic, blending Christian ideas with classical tgought, often mixing genres.  The philosopher Boethius translated much of Aristotle's writings into Latin.  Gregory of Tours and Bede were historians who strove for historical accuracy and objectivity. Aachen wrote a biography of Charlemagne which was a major literary achievement of the Middle Ages.<ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|202}} \n\nOne event that impacted Christian thought on tolerance, took place in 782 in what had been Roman Gaul and would one day be modern France. Charlemagne was king. As king, he advocated Christian principles, had at least one Christian advisor, and openly supported Christian missions. The Franks had been fighting the Saxons since  Charlemagne's grandfather, with Charlemagne himself beginning in earnest in 772, taking years to finally defeat them.  They made treaties.  The events of 782 began when Widukind, the Saxon leader, persuaded a group of Saxons who had submitted to Charlemagne, to break their treaty and rebel. Charlemagne was elsewhere, so they went to battle with the Frankish army that had been left behind and annihilated it.  They killed two of the King\u2019s chief lieutenants, and some of his closest companions and counsellors. Charlemagne gathered his forces, returned to Saxony, conquered the Saxon rebels, giving them the option of convert or die. The Saxons largely refused, and though no one knows the number for sure, it is said 4500 unarmed prisoners were murdered in what is called the \"[[Massacre of Verden]].\" Massive deportations followed, and death was decreed as the penalty for any Saxon who refused baptism thereafter.<ref name =\"Logan\">{{cite book|last=Logan|first=F.

This was the accepted position of Christian thought at this time but that began to change by the end of this era.\n\nIn 1095 at the Council of Claremont, in response to an appeal for help from the Patriarch of Constantinople, Urban II preached a sermon urging his listeners to undertake an expedition to the Near East, under papal leadership. It is probably the most studied sermon in history.  This is problematic, since the original has been lost and the three writers who attended the Council of Clermont recorded three different versions which are each quite distinctive in content and style.<ref name=\"Strack\">{{cite journal|last=Strack|first=Georg|title=The Sermon of Urban II in Clermont and the Tradition of Papal Oratory|journal=medieval sermon studies|volume=5|year=2012|pages=30-45|url=https://www.mag.geschichte.uni-muenchen.de/downloads/strack_urban.pdf|access-date= April 22, 2020}}</ref>. \n\nHowever, there is some consensus that a comparison of the best 5 versions of the sermon (the three witnesses and two they told personally) makes it possible to identify the subjects Urban discussed.

The liturgy was expanded to include the blessing of weapons and standards. Knights were consecrated by ceremonies which were often a revival of old pagan customs.  There were new religious orders established such as the Templars who promised to fight the enemies of God in addition to taking the normal vows of poverty, chastity and obedience.  When violence became sacred, the enemy was believed to be diabolical.  Thus the Turks were looked upon as opponents of the kingdom of God, a fulfillment of the forces of the antichrist as predicted in the book of Revelation.</blockquote>\n\nThis ''merged view'' is also supported in Riley-Smith who says the crusades were products of the renewed spirituality of the central Middle Ages, with its concern for living the ''vita apostolica'' and expressing Christian ideals in active works of charity, exemplified by the new hospitals, the pastoral work of the Augustinians and Premonstratensians, and the service of the friars.

Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1988. p.g. 157-158</ref> An example of how the use of forced conversion was justified, in the medieval Church, as compatible with previous Church doctrine on the subject can be found for instance in a statement made by [[Pope Innocent III]] in 1201 about those who agreed to be baptized to avoid torture and intimidation:\n\n<blockquote>[T]hose who are immersed even though reluctant, do belong to ecclesiastical jurisdiction at least by reason of the sacrament, and might therefore be reasonably compelled to observe the rules of the Christian Faith. It is, to be sure, contrary to the Christian Faith that anyone who is unwilling and wholly opposed to it should be compelled to adopt and observe Christianity. For this reason a valid distinction is made by some between kinds of unwilling ones and kinds of compelled ones. Thus one who is drawn to Christianity by violence, through fear and through torture, and receives the sacrament of Baptism in order to avoid loss, he (like one who comes to Baptism in dissimulation) does receive the impress of Christianity, and may be forced to observe the Christian Faith as one who expressed a conditional willingness though, absolutely speaking, he was unwilling ...<ref>Chazan, Robert, ed., Church, State, and Jew in the Middle Ages, West Orange, NJ:Behrman House, 1980, p. 103.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn addition to sponsoring forced conversion, the Church accepted the use of forced conversion as a pretext for the elimination of hostile or recalcitrant tribes that did not easily submit to conquest.<ref>Fonnesberg-Schmidt, Iben. \u201cPope Honorius III and Mission and Crusades in the Baltic Region\u201d.

The Reformers \"fully embraced\" Augustine's advocacy of coercion in religious matters, and many regarded the death penalty for heresy as legitimate.<ref name=\"Coffey23\" />  Furthermore, by presenting a much more powerful threat to Catholic unity than the heretic groups of the Middle Ages, the Reformation led to the intensification of persecution under Catholic regimes.\n\n*[[Martin Luther]] had written against persecution in the 1520s, and had demonstrated genuine sympathy towards the Jews in his earlier writings, especially in ''Das Jesus ein geborener Jude sei'' (''That Jesus was born as a Jew'') from 1523,  but after 1525 his position hardened. In ''Wider die Sabbather an einen guten Freund'' (Against the Sabbather to a Good Friend), 1538, he still considered a conversion of the Jews to Christianity as possible,<ref>Thomas Kaufmann, 2005: ''Luthers \"Judenschriften in ihren historischen Kontexten'' (Nachrichten der Akademie der Wissenschaften zu G\u00f6ttingen) {{in lang|de}}, p. 526</ref> but in 1543 he published [[On the Jews and their Lies]], a \"violent anti-semitic tract.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 23, 24</ref>\n*[[John Calvin]] helped to secure the execution for heresy of [[Michael Servetus]],<ref>Coffey 2000: 24.</ref> although he unsuccessfully requested that he should be beheaded instead of being burned at the stake.\n\nEffectively, however, the 16th-century Protestant view was less extreme than the mediaeval Catholic position. In England, [[John Foxe]], [[John Hales]], [[Richard Perrinchief]], [[Herbert Thorndike]] and [[Jonas Proast]] all only saw mild forms of persecution against the [[English Dissenters]] as legitimate.<ref>see Coffey 2000: 24,25.</ref> But (with the probable exception of John Foxe), this was only a retraction in degree, not a full rejection of religious persecution.  There is also the crucial distinction between ''dissent'' and ''heresy'' to consider. Most dissenters disagreed with the Anglican Church only on secondary matters of worship and ecclesiology, and although this was a considered a serious sin, only a few 17th-century Anglican writers thought that this 'crime' deserved the death penalty.<ref name=\"Coffey00-25\">Coffey 2000: 25</ref> These concerns notwithstanding, the English government saw fit to execute as treasonous a multitude of priests, dissenters, and recusant Catholics, even those who retained but private reservations.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The English Act of Supremacy thus significantly complicated the matter by securely welding Church and state.\n\nThe Elizabethan bishop [[Thomas Bilson]] was of the opinion that men ought to be \"corrected, not murdered\",  but he did not condemn the Christian Emperors for executing the [[Manichaeans]] for \"monstrous blasphemies\".<ref>Coffey 2000: 24,26; Thomas Bilson 1585, ''The True Difference between Christian Subjection and Unchristian Rebellion'', pp. 19,20, 383.</ref> The Lutheran theologian [[Georgius Calixtus]] argued for the reconciliation of Christendom by removing all unimportant differences between Catholicism and Protestantism, and [[Rupertus Meldenius]] advocated [[in necessariis unitas, in dubiis libertas, in omnibus caritas]] (''in necessary things unity; in uncertain things freedom; in everything compassion'') in 1626.\n\n==Protestant advocacy of toleration==\n\n===The English Protestant 'Call for Toleration'===\nWhile the Christian theologians mentioned above advocated religious persecution to various extents, it was also Christians who helped pioneer the concept of [[religious toleration]].\n\nIn his book on 'The English Reformation', particularly in the chapter 'The Origins of Religious Toleration', the late [[A. G. Dickens]] argued that from the beginning of the Reformation there had \"existed in Protestant thought \u2013 in [[Huldrych Zwingli|Zwingli]], [[Philipp Melanchthon|Melanchthon]] and [[Martin Bucer|Bucer]], as well as among the Anabaptists \u2013 a more liberal tradition, which [[John Frith]] was perhaps the first echo in England\".<ref>{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 438}};</ref> Condemned for heresy, Frith was burnt at the stake in 1533. In his own mind, he died not because of the denial of the doctrines on purgatory and transubstantiation but \"for the principle that a particular doctrine on either point was not a necessary part of a Christian's faith\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\">{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 116}};</ref> In other words, there was an important distinction to be made between a genuine article of faith and other matters where a variety of very different conclusions should be tolerated within the Church. This stand against unreasonable and profligate dogmatism meant that Frith, \"to a greater extent than any other of our early Protestants\", upheld \"a certain degree of religious freedom\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\"/>\n\nFrith was not alone. [[John Foxe]], for example, \"strove hard to save Anabaptists from the fire, and he enunciated a sweeping doctrine of tolerance even towards Catholics, whose doctrines he detested with every fibre of his being\".<ref>{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|pages= 439\u2013440}};</ref>\n\nIn the early 17th century, [[Thomas Helwys]] was principal formulator of that distinctively [[Baptist]] request: that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law, so that individuals might have a freedom of religious conscience. Helwys said the King \"is a mortal man, and not God, therefore he hath no power over the mortal soul of his subjects to make laws and ordinances for them and to set spiritual Lords over them\".<ref>{{cite book |title= \u2018A Short Declaration on the Mystery of Iniquity\u2019|last= Helwys|first= Thomas|year= 1612}};</ref> [[James I of England|King James I]] had Helwys thrown into Newgate prison, where he had died by 1616 at about the age of forty.\n\nBy the time of the English Revolution Helwys' stance on religious toleration was more commonplace. However, whilst accepting their zeal in desiring a 'godly society', some contemporary historians doubt whether the English [[Puritans]] during the English Revolution were as committed to religious liberty and pluralism as traditional histories have suggested. However, historian John Coffey's recent work<ref>Coffey, John (1998) \"Puritanism & Liberty Revisited: The Case for Toleration in the English Revolution\", ''The Historical Journal'', Cambridge University Press.</ref> emphasises the contribution of a minority of radical Protestants who steadfastly sought toleration for heresy, blasphemy, [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]], non-Christian religions, and even [[atheism]]. This minority included the Seekers, as well as the [[General Baptists]] and the [[Levellers]]. Their collective witness demanded the church be an entirely voluntary, non-coercive community able to evangelise in a pluralistic society governed by a purely civil state. Such a demand was in sharp contrast to the ambitions of the magisterial Protestantism of the Calvinist majority.\n\nIn 1644 the \"Augustinian consensus concerning persecution was irreparably fractured.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 47.</ref> This year can be identified quite exactly, because 1644 saw the publication of [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Areopagitica]]'', [[William Walwyn]]'s ''The Compassionate Samaritane'', [[Henry Robinson (writer)|Henry Robinson]]'s ''Liberty of Conscience'' and [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger William]]'s ''[[The Bloudy Tenent of Persecution]].'' These authors were Puritans or had dissented from the Church of England, and their radical Protestantism led them to condemn religious persecution, which they saw as a popish corruption of primitive Christianity.<ref name=Coffey50>Coffey 2000: 50.</ref> Other non-Anglican writers advocating toleration were [[Richard Overton (pamphleteer)|Richard Overton]], [[John Wildman]] and [[John Goodwin (preacher)|John Goodwin]], the Baptists [[Samuel Richardson (Baptist)|Samuel Richardson]] and [[Thomas Collier (Unitarian)|Thomas Collier]] and the Quakers [[Samuel Fisher (quaker)|Samuel Fisher]] and [[William Penn]]. Anglicans who argued against persecution were: [[John Locke]], [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury]], [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]], [[Jeremy Taylor]],  [[Henry More]], [[John Tillotson]] and [[Gilbert Burnet]].<ref>This list is taken from: Coffey (2000), 50</ref>\n\nAll of these considered themselves Christians or were actual churchmen. John Milton and John Locke are the predecessors of modern [[liberalism]]. Although Milton was a Puritan and Locke an Anglican, ''Areopagitica'' and ''A Letter concerning Toleration'' are canonical liberal texts.<ref>Coffey 2000: 206; A. Patterson, ''Early Modern Liberalism'', Cambridge 1997</ref>  Only from the 1690s onwards the philosophy of [[Deism]] emerged, and with it a third group that advocated religious toleration, but, unlike the radical Protestants and the Anglicans, also rejected biblical authority; this group prominently includes [[Voltaire]], [[Frederick II of Prussia]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] and the English-Irish philosopher [[John Toland]].<ref name=\"Coffey50\" /> When Toland published the writings of Milton, [[Edmund Ludlow]] and [[Algernon Sidney]], he tried to downplay the Puritan divinity in these works.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-207\"/>\n\nThe [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], issued the [[Patent of Toleration]] in 1781.\n\n===Developments in 17th-century England===\n\n{{Expand section|date=July 2009}}\nFollowing the debates that started in the 1640s the [[Church of England]] was the first Christian church to grant adherents of other [[Christian denominations]] freedom of worship, with the [[Act of Toleration 1689]], which  nevertheless still retained some forms of [[religious discrimination]] and did not include toleration for Catholics.

What the survey really shows is that more US Christians believe that God can make himself known through multiple Christian sects, than believe that He can make Himself known even through other religions. It is worth noting that a majority of US Christians take the more inclusive stance.)\n\n==The mid-20th-century Spanish model==\n{{Separation of church and state in the history of the Catholic Church|expanded = 20th}}\n\nAs of the mid-20th century, an example of Catholic church-state relations was the Catholic situation in [[Spain under Franco|Franco's Spain]], where according to the doctrine of [[National Catholicism]] the Catholic Church:\n* was officially recognized and protected by the state,\n* had substantial control over social policy, and\n* had this relationship explicitly set out in a [[Concordat]].\nIt had long been the policy of the Catholic Church to support [[toleration]] of competing religions under such a scheme, but it also supported legal restrictions on attempts to convert Catholics to those same religions, under the motto that \"error has no rights\".{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\n==Modern Roman Catholic policy==\nOn the seventh of December 1965 The Catholic Church's [[Vatican II]] council issued the decree \"[[Dignitatis humanae]]\" which dealt with the rights of the person and communities to social and civil liberty in religious matters. It states: \"2. The Vatican Council declares that the human person has a right to religious freedom. Freedom of this kind means that all men should be immune from coercion on the part of individuals, social groups and every human power so that, within due limits, nobody is forced to act against his convictions in religious matters in private or public, alone or in associations with others. The Vatican Council further declares that the right of religious freedom is based on the very word of God and by reason itself. This right of the human person to religious freedom must be given such recognition in the constitutional order of society as will make it a civic right...but if it [the civil authority] presumes to control or restrict religious activity it must be said to have exceeded the limits of its power...Therefore, provided the just requirements of public order are not violated, these groups [i.e. religious communities] have a right to immunity so that they may organize their own lives according to their religious principles...From this it follows that it is wrong for a public authority to compel its citizens by force or fear or any other means to profess or repudiate any religion or to prevent anyone from joining or leaving a religious body. There is even more serious transgression of God's will and of the sacred rights of the individual person and the family of nations when force is applied to wipe out or repress religion either throughout the whole world or in a single region or in a particular community\".<ref>Austin Flannery (General Editor), Vatican Council II - The Conciliar and Post Concilliar Documents, 1981 Edition</ref>\n\nOn 12 March 2000 [[Pope John Paul II]] prayed for forgiveness because \"Christians have often denied the Gospel; yielding to a mentality of power, they have violated the rights of ethnic groups and peoples, and shown contempt for their cultures and religious traditions\" <ref>{{cite web|title=POPE JOHN PAUL II ASKS FOR FORGIVENESS|date=March 12, 2000|access-date=April 16, 2007 |url=http://www.sacredheart.edu/faithservice/centerforchristianandjewishunderstanding/documentsandstatements/popejohnpauliiasksforforgivenessmarch122000/|publisher=[[Sacred Heart University]]}}</ref>\n\nCardinal Joseph Ratzinger ([[Pope Benedict XVI]]) wrote \"The quality of exemplarity which the honest admission of past faults can exert on attitudes within the Church and civil society should also be noted, for it gives rise to a renewed obedience to the Truth and to respect for the dignity and the rights of others, most especially, of the very weak.

Clovis the first, a convert to Latin Christianity, became the first important ruler of  the Merovingian dynasty. He supported missionaries in newly conquered territories and strengthened ties with the Pope. After 700, the Merovongians gradually lost control of the kingdom to the Carolingians.  In 754, the Pope traveled to St.Denis, near Paris, to crown Pepin the Short king and name him defender of the faith. In exchange, Pepin crushed the Lombards and gave their land to the Pope.

Under feudalism, a noble Lord gave military support to his king, but when so many nobles sold or leased their land and left for the East on crusade, kings began building armies of mercenaries for themselves and taking over legal processes that had traditionally been local.

Although the Spanish had agreed to allow Muslims the freedom of religion in 1492, this was often ignored. In 1501, Muslims were offered the choice of conversion or exile. In 1556, Arab or Muslim dress was forbidden, and in 1566 Arabic language as a whole was prohibited in Spain.<ref>{{cite book | last = Lapidus | first =  Ira M. | title = A History of Islamic societes | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1988 | isbn = 0-521-22552-3| page = 389}}</ref> Jews were eventually expelled from England by King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], too.\n\n====Reformation Era====\n\nWhen [[Martin Luther]] wrote his [[The Ninety-Five Theses|Ninety-Five Theses]] in 1517, Catholicism reacted the same way as it had to the heresies of the late Middle Ages. However, while the [[Protestant Reformation]] could be \"crushed\" in Spain with \"a few dozen executions in the 1550s\",<ref>Coffey 2000: 212</ref> the same strategy failed in Germany, Northern Europe and in England. France had to suffer through the [[French Wars of Religion]] before it again became wholly Catholic. The divide between [[Catholicism]] and  the new [[Protestantism|Protestant denominations]] was deep. Protestants commonly alleged that the catholic [[Pope]] was the [[Antichrist]]. Conflicts between Christian factions reached their heights in France with the 1572 [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]], in Germany and [[Central Europe]] with the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648) and in England with the [[English Civil War]] (1641\u20131651). Following the devastations caused by these wars, the ideas of [[religious toleration]], [[freedom of religion]] and [[religious pluralism]] slowly gained ground in Europe. The [[Witch trials in Early Modern Europe]], which had reached their height between 1550 and 1650, continued until 1750.\n\n====Early Modern Era====\n\nEuropean [[Colonialism]], that was accompanied by Christian evangelism and often by violence, led to the suppression of [[Folk religion|indigenous religions]] in the territories conquered or usurped by the Europeans. The [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] largely destroyed the [[Aztec]] and [[Inca civilization]]. However, Colonialism (and later European [[Imperialism]]) as a whole were not motivated by religious zeal; the suppression of the indigenous religions was their side result, not their main purpose. Only partial aspects, like the [[Goa Inquisition]], bear resemblance to the persecutions that occurred on the European continent. By the 18th century, persecutions of unsanctioned beliefs had been reduced in most Europeans countries to [[religious discrimination]], in the form of legal restrictions on those who did not accept the official faith. This often included being barred from higher education, or from participation in the national legislature. In colonized nations, attempts to convert native peoples to Christianity became more encouraging and less forceful. In British India during the Victorian era, Christian converts were given preferential treatment for governmental appointments.\n\n====Modern Era====\nAt the present time, most countries in which Christianity is the religion of the majority of the people, are either [[secular state]]s or they embrace the [[separation of Church and State]] in another way. (A list of countries in which Christianity is still the state religion can be found in the article on [[State religion]].)

This is problematic, since the original has been lost and the three writers who attended the Council of Clermont recorded three different versions which are each quite distinctive in content and style.<ref name=\"Strack\">{{cite journal|last=Strack|first=Georg|title=The Sermon of Urban II in Clermont and the Tradition of Papal Oratory|journal=medieval sermon studies|volume=5|year=2012|pages=30-45|url=https://www.mag.geschichte.uni-muenchen.de/downloads/strack_urban.pdf|access-date= April 22, 2020}}</ref>. \n\nHowever, there is some consensus that a comparison of the best 5 versions of the sermon (the three witnesses and two they told personally) makes it possible to identify the subjects Urban discussed. '''''The necessity of aiding the brethren in the East''''' is in all versions; that there were '''''appeals for aid from the East''''' is mentioned in four of the five best sources; '''''the victorious advance of the Turks''''' is mentioned in three and assumed in the other two; '''''the suffering of Christians and/or pilgrims in the East''''' is mentioned by all; '''''desecration or destruction of churches and Christian Holy places''''' is mentioned by all; the idea '''''this is God's work''''' is mentioned by all; that '''''rich and poor alike should go''''' is mentioned only by one; '''''plenary indulgence''''' is mentioned by all and confirmed by the canon of the Council; expressions of '''''contempt for Turks''''' are present in all, use the common terms of the era, and whether they are from the authors or Urban is unknown; fight a '''''righteous war instead of local combats''''' is mentioned in all versions; and the '''''special sanctity of Jerusalem''''' is mentioned by three.<ref name=\"Munro\">{{cite journal|last=Munro|first= Dana Carleton|title=The Speech of Pope Urban II.

The liturgy was expanded to include the blessing of weapons and standards. Knights were consecrated by ceremonies which were often a revival of old pagan customs.  There were new religious orders established such as the Templars who promised to fight the enemies of God in addition to taking the normal vows of poverty, chastity and obedience.  When violence became sacred, the enemy was believed to be diabolical.  Thus the Turks were looked upon as opponents of the kingdom of God, a fulfillment of the forces of the antichrist as predicted in the book of Revelation.</blockquote>\n\nThis ''merged view'' is also supported in Riley-Smith who says the crusades were products of the renewed spirituality of the central Middle Ages, with its concern for living the ''vita apostolica'' and expressing Christian ideals in active works of charity, exemplified by the new hospitals, the pastoral work of the Augustinians and Premonstratensians, and the service of the friars.

These tactics were particularly widely used in the [[Northern Crusades]], where Christian rulers \u2013 and, later, monastic orders such as the [[Teutonic Knights]] \u2013 waged a centuries-long series of campaigns to compel the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of the region to convert by conquering them and settling in the newly conquered territory as feudal rulers.<ref>Christiansen, Eric. The Northern Crusades. London: Penguin Books. pg. 14-15</ref> The region's inhabitants resisted conquest, and, even once subjected, rebelled repeatedly in an effort to reject Christianity and reverse the conquest. As part of these campaigns, forced conversions were widespread; massacre and atrocity, combined with the capture and killing of hostages to compel surrender and conversion, were commonly used tactics.<ref>Christiansen, Eric.

Medieval Germany: 1056-1273. Trans. Helga Braun and Richard Mortimer. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1988. p.g. 157-158</ref> An example of how the use of forced conversion was justified, in the medieval Church, as compatible with previous Church doctrine on the subject can be found for instance in a statement made by [[Pope Innocent III]] in 1201 about those who agreed to be baptized to avoid torture and intimidation:\n\n<blockquote>[T]hose who are immersed even though reluctant, do belong to ecclesiastical jurisdiction at least by reason of the sacrament, and might therefore be reasonably compelled to observe the rules of the Christian Faith. It is, to be sure, contrary to the Christian Faith that anyone who is unwilling and wholly opposed to it should be compelled to adopt and observe Christianity. For this reason a valid distinction is made by some between kinds of unwilling ones and kinds of compelled ones. Thus one who is drawn to Christianity by violence, through fear and through torture, and receives the sacrament of Baptism in order to avoid loss, he (like one who comes to Baptism in dissimulation) does receive the impress of Christianity, and may be forced to observe the Christian Faith as one who expressed a conditional willingness though, absolutely speaking, he was unwilling ...<ref>Chazan, Robert, ed., Church, State, and Jew in the Middle Ages, West Orange, NJ:Behrman House, 1980, p. 103.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn addition to sponsoring forced conversion, the Church accepted the use of forced conversion as a pretext for the elimination of hostile or recalcitrant tribes that did not easily submit to conquest.<ref>Fonnesberg-Schmidt, Iben. \u201cPope Honorius III and Mission and Crusades in the Baltic Region\u201d.

The Reformers \"fully embraced\" Augustine's advocacy of coercion in religious matters, and many regarded the death penalty for heresy as legitimate.<ref name=\"Coffey23\" />  Furthermore, by presenting a much more powerful threat to Catholic unity than the heretic groups of the Middle Ages, the Reformation led to the intensification of persecution under Catholic regimes.\n\n*[[Martin Luther]] had written against persecution in the 1520s, and had demonstrated genuine sympathy towards the Jews in his earlier writings, especially in ''Das Jesus ein geborener Jude sei'' (''That Jesus was born as a Jew'') from 1523,  but after 1525 his position hardened. In ''Wider die Sabbather an einen guten Freund'' (Against the Sabbather to a Good Friend), 1538, he still considered a conversion of the Jews to Christianity as possible,<ref>Thomas Kaufmann, 2005: ''Luthers \"Judenschriften in ihren historischen Kontexten'' (Nachrichten der Akademie der Wissenschaften zu G\u00f6ttingen) {{in lang|de}}, p. 526</ref> but in 1543 he published [[On the Jews and their Lies]], a \"violent anti-semitic tract.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 23, 24</ref>\n*[[John Calvin]] helped to secure the execution for heresy of [[Michael Servetus]],<ref>Coffey 2000: 24.</ref> although he unsuccessfully requested that he should be beheaded instead of being burned at the stake.\n\nEffectively, however, the 16th-century Protestant view was less extreme than the mediaeval Catholic position. In England, [[John Foxe]], [[John Hales]], [[Richard Perrinchief]], [[Herbert Thorndike]] and [[Jonas Proast]] all only saw mild forms of persecution against the [[English Dissenters]] as legitimate.<ref>see Coffey 2000: 24,25.</ref> But (with the probable exception of John Foxe), this was only a retraction in degree, not a full rejection of religious persecution.  There is also the crucial distinction between ''dissent'' and ''heresy'' to consider. Most dissenters disagreed with the Anglican Church only on secondary matters of worship and ecclesiology, and although this was a considered a serious sin, only a few 17th-century Anglican writers thought that this 'crime' deserved the death penalty.<ref name=\"Coffey00-25\">Coffey 2000: 25</ref> These concerns notwithstanding, the English government saw fit to execute as treasonous a multitude of priests, dissenters, and recusant Catholics, even those who retained but private reservations.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The English Act of Supremacy thus significantly complicated the matter by securely welding Church and state.\n\nThe Elizabethan bishop [[Thomas Bilson]] was of the opinion that men ought to be \"corrected, not murdered\",  but he did not condemn the Christian Emperors for executing the [[Manichaeans]] for \"monstrous blasphemies\".<ref>Coffey 2000: 24,26; Thomas Bilson 1585, ''The True Difference between Christian Subjection and Unchristian Rebellion'', pp. 19,20, 383.</ref> The Lutheran theologian [[Georgius Calixtus]] argued for the reconciliation of Christendom by removing all unimportant differences between Catholicism and Protestantism, and [[Rupertus Meldenius]] advocated [[in necessariis unitas, in dubiis libertas, in omnibus caritas]] (''in necessary things unity; in uncertain things freedom; in everything compassion'') in 1626.\n\n==Protestant advocacy of toleration==\n\n===The English Protestant 'Call for Toleration'===\nWhile the Christian theologians mentioned above advocated religious persecution to various extents, it was also Christians who helped pioneer the concept of [[religious toleration]].\n\nIn his book on 'The English Reformation', particularly in the chapter 'The Origins of Religious Toleration', the late [[A. G. Dickens]] argued that from the beginning of the Reformation there had \"existed in Protestant thought \u2013 in [[Huldrych Zwingli|Zwingli]], [[Philipp Melanchthon|Melanchthon]] and [[Martin Bucer|Bucer]], as well as among the Anabaptists \u2013 a more liberal tradition, which [[John Frith]] was perhaps the first echo in England\".<ref>{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 438}};</ref> Condemned for heresy, Frith was burnt at the stake in 1533. In his own mind, he died not because of the denial of the doctrines on purgatory and transubstantiation but \"for the principle that a particular doctrine on either point was not a necessary part of a Christian's faith\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\">{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 116}};</ref> In other words, there was an important distinction to be made between a genuine article of faith and other matters where a variety of very different conclusions should be tolerated within the Church. This stand against unreasonable and profligate dogmatism meant that Frith, \"to a greater extent than any other of our early Protestants\", upheld \"a certain degree of religious freedom\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\"/>\n\nFrith was not alone. [[John Foxe]], for example, \"strove hard to save Anabaptists from the fire, and he enunciated a sweeping doctrine of tolerance even towards Catholics, whose doctrines he detested with every fibre of his being\".<ref>{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|pages= 439\u2013440}};</ref>\n\nIn the early 17th century, [[Thomas Helwys]] was principal formulator of that distinctively [[Baptist]] request: that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law, so that individuals might have a freedom of religious conscience. Helwys said the King \"is a mortal man, and not God, therefore he hath no power over the mortal soul of his subjects to make laws and ordinances for them and to set spiritual Lords over them\".<ref>{{cite book |title= \u2018A Short Declaration on the Mystery of Iniquity\u2019|last= Helwys|first= Thomas|year= 1612}};</ref> [[James I of England|King James I]] had Helwys thrown into Newgate prison, where he had died by 1616 at about the age of forty.\n\nBy the time of the English Revolution Helwys' stance on religious toleration was more commonplace. However, whilst accepting their zeal in desiring a 'godly society', some contemporary historians doubt whether the English [[Puritans]] during the English Revolution were as committed to religious liberty and pluralism as traditional histories have suggested. However, historian John Coffey's recent work<ref>Coffey, John (1998) \"Puritanism & Liberty Revisited: The Case for Toleration in the English Revolution\", ''The Historical Journal'', Cambridge University Press.</ref> emphasises the contribution of a minority of radical Protestants who steadfastly sought toleration for heresy, blasphemy, [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]], non-Christian religions, and even [[atheism]]. This minority included the Seekers, as well as the [[General Baptists]] and the [[Levellers]]. Their collective witness demanded the church be an entirely voluntary, non-coercive community able to evangelise in a pluralistic society governed by a purely civil state. Such a demand was in sharp contrast to the ambitions of the magisterial Protestantism of the Calvinist majority.\n\nIn 1644 the \"Augustinian consensus concerning persecution was irreparably fractured.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 47.</ref> This year can be identified quite exactly, because 1644 saw the publication of [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Areopagitica]]'', [[William Walwyn]]'s ''The Compassionate Samaritane'', [[Henry Robinson (writer)|Henry Robinson]]'s ''Liberty of Conscience'' and [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger William]]'s ''[[The Bloudy Tenent of Persecution]].'' These authors were Puritans or had dissented from the Church of England, and their radical Protestantism led them to condemn religious persecution, which they saw as a popish corruption of primitive Christianity.<ref name=Coffey50>Coffey 2000: 50.</ref> Other non-Anglican writers advocating toleration were [[Richard Overton (pamphleteer)|Richard Overton]], [[John Wildman]] and [[John Goodwin (preacher)|John Goodwin]], the Baptists [[Samuel Richardson (Baptist)|Samuel Richardson]] and [[Thomas Collier (Unitarian)|Thomas Collier]] and the Quakers [[Samuel Fisher (quaker)|Samuel Fisher]] and [[William Penn]]. Anglicans who argued against persecution were: [[John Locke]], [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury]], [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]], [[Jeremy Taylor]],  [[Henry More]], [[John Tillotson]] and [[Gilbert Burnet]].<ref>This list is taken from: Coffey (2000), 50</ref>\n\nAll of these considered themselves Christians or were actual churchmen. John Milton and John Locke are the predecessors of modern [[liberalism]]. Although Milton was a Puritan and Locke an Anglican, ''Areopagitica'' and ''A Letter concerning Toleration'' are canonical liberal texts.<ref>Coffey 2000: 206; A. Patterson, ''Early Modern Liberalism'', Cambridge 1997</ref>  Only from the 1690s onwards the philosophy of [[Deism]] emerged, and with it a third group that advocated religious toleration, but, unlike the radical Protestants and the Anglicans, also rejected biblical authority; this group prominently includes [[Voltaire]], [[Frederick II of Prussia]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] and the English-Irish philosopher [[John Toland]].<ref name=\"Coffey50\" /> When Toland published the writings of Milton, [[Edmund Ludlow]] and [[Algernon Sidney]], he tried to downplay the Puritan divinity in these works.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-207\"/>\n\nThe [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], issued the [[Patent of Toleration]] in 1781.\n\n===Developments in 17th-century England===\n\n{{Expand section|date=July 2009}}\nFollowing the debates that started in the 1640s the [[Church of England]] was the first Christian church to grant adherents of other [[Christian denominations]] freedom of worship, with the [[Act of Toleration 1689]], which  nevertheless still retained some forms of [[religious discrimination]] and did not include toleration for Catholics.

For some Christians, different sects of Christianity represent \"different religions.\" These people thus mistake the survey term \"many religions\" to mean \"different sects of Christianity,\" even though that is not the commonly intended use of the phrase. What the survey really shows is that more US Christians believe that God can make himself known through multiple Christian sects, than believe that He can make Himself known even through other religions. It is worth noting that a majority of US Christians take the more inclusive stance.)\n\n==The mid-20th-century Spanish model==\n{{Separation of church and state in the history of the Catholic Church|expanded = 20th}}\n\nAs of the mid-20th century, an example of Catholic church-state relations was the Catholic situation in [[Spain under Franco|Franco's Spain]], where according to the doctrine of [[National Catholicism]] the Catholic Church:\n* was officially recognized and protected by the state,\n* had substantial control over social policy, and\n* had this relationship explicitly set out in a [[Concordat]].\nIt had long been the policy of the Catholic Church to support [[toleration]] of competing religions under such a scheme, but it also supported legal restrictions on attempts to convert Catholics to those same religions, under the motto that \"error has no rights\".{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\n==Modern Roman Catholic policy==\nOn the seventh of December 1965 The Catholic Church's [[Vatican II]] council issued the decree \"[[Dignitatis humanae]]\" which dealt with the rights of the person and communities to social and civil liberty in religious matters. It states: \"2. The Vatican Council declares that the human person has a right to religious freedom. Freedom of this kind means that all men should be immune from coercion on the part of individuals, social groups and every human power so that, within due limits, nobody is forced to act against his convictions in religious matters in private or public, alone or in associations with others. The Vatican Council further declares that the right of religious freedom is based on the very word of God and by reason itself. This right of the human person to religious freedom must be given such recognition in the constitutional order of society as will make it a civic right...but if it [the civil authority] presumes to control or restrict religious activity it must be said to have exceeded the limits of its power...Therefore, provided the just requirements of public order are not violated, these groups [i.e. religious communities] have a right to immunity so that they may organize their own lives according to their religious principles...From this it follows that it is wrong for a public authority to compel its citizens by force or fear or any other means to profess or repudiate any religion or to prevent anyone from joining or leaving a religious body. There is even more serious transgression of God's will and of the sacred rights of the individual person and the family of nations when force is applied to wipe out or repress religion either throughout the whole world or in a single region or in a particular community\".<ref>Austin Flannery (General Editor), Vatican Council II - The Conciliar and Post Concilliar Documents, 1981 Edition</ref>\n\nOn 12 March 2000 [[Pope John Paul II]] prayed for forgiveness because \"Christians have often denied the Gospel; yielding to a mentality of power, they have violated the rights of ethnic groups and peoples, and shown contempt for their cultures and religious traditions\" <ref>{{cite web|title=POPE JOHN PAUL II ASKS FOR FORGIVENESS|date=March 12, 2000|access-date=April 16, 2007 |url=http://www.sacredheart.edu/faithservice/centerforchristianandjewishunderstanding/documentsandstatements/popejohnpauliiasksforforgivenessmarch122000/|publisher=[[Sacred Heart University]]}}</ref>\n\nCardinal Joseph Ratzinger ([[Pope Benedict XVI]]) wrote \"The quality of exemplarity which the honest admission of past faults can exert on attitudes within the Church and civil society should also be noted, for it gives rise to a renewed obedience to the Truth and to respect for the dignity and the rights of others, most especially, of the very weak.
