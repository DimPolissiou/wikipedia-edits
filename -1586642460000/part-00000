R. R. Tolkien]]. It was published on 21 September 1937 to wide critical acclaim, being nominated for the [[Carnegie Medal (literary award)|Carnegie Medal]] and awarded a prize from the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'' for best juvenile fiction. The book remains popular and is recognized as a classic in children's literature.\n\n''The Hobbit'' is set within Tolkien's [[fictional universe]] and follows the quest of home-loving [[Bilbo Baggins]], the titular [[hobbit]], to win a share of the treasure guarded by [[Smaug]] the [[Dragon (Middle-earth)|dragon]]. Bilbo's journey takes him from light-hearted, rural surroundings into more sinister territory.\n\nThe story is told in the form of an episodic quest, and most chapters introduce a specific creature or type of creature of Tolkien's geography. Bilbo gains a new level of maturity, competence, and wisdom by accepting the disreputable, romantic, fey, and adventurous sides of his nature and applying his wits and common sense. The story reaches its climax in the Battle of Five Armies, where many of the characters and creatures from earlier chapters re-emerge to engage in conflict.\n\nPersonal growth and forms of heroism are central themes of the story, along with motifs of warfare. These themes have led critics to view [[J. R. R. Tolkien#First World War|Tolkien's own experiences during World War I]] as instrumental in shaping the story. The author's scholarly knowledge of [[Germanic philology]] and interest in mythology and [[fairy tales]] are often noted as influences.\n\nThe publisher was encouraged by the book's critical and financial success and, therefore, requested a sequel. As Tolkien's work progressed on the successor ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', he made retrospective accommodations for it in ''The Hobbit''. These few but significant changes were integrated into the second edition. Further editions followed with minor emendations, including those reflecting Tolkien's changing concept of the world into which Bilbo stumbled.\n\nThe work has never been out of print. Its ongoing legacy encompasses many adaptations for stage, screen, radio, board games, and video games. Several of these adaptations have received critical recognition on their own merits.\n\n==Characters==\n{{Main|List of The Hobbit characters}}[[Bilbo Baggins]], the titular protagonist, is a respectable, reserved [[hobbit]]\u2014a race resembling very short humans who live in underground houses and are mainly pastoral farmers and gardeners.<ref>{{cite book|title=Red Riding Hood and the Wolf in Bed: Modernism's Fairy Tales |first=Ann |last=Martin |publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]] |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-8020-9086-7 |quote=... \u2014prefigure the bourgeois preoccupations of J.

When the music ends, Gandalf unveils Thr\u00f3r's map showing a [[secret door]] into the Mountain and proposes that the dumbfounded Bilbo serve as the expedition's \"burglar\". The dwarves ridicule the idea, but Bilbo, indignant, joins despite himself.\n\nThe group travels into the wild, where Gandalf saves the company from [[Troll (Middle-earth)|trolls]] and leads them to [[Rivendell]], where [[Elrond]] reveals more secrets from the map. When they attempt to cross the [[Misty Mountains]] they are caught by [[Orc (Middle-earth)|goblins]] and driven [[Goblin Town|deep underground]]. Although Gandalf rescues them, Bilbo gets separated from the others as they flee the goblins. Lost in the goblin tunnels, he stumbles across [[One Ring|a mysterious ring]] and then encounters [[Gollum]], who engages him in a game of riddles. As a reward for solving all riddles Gollum will show him the path out of the tunnels, but if Bilbo fails, his life will be forfeit. With the help of the ring, which confers [[invisibility]], Bilbo escapes and rejoins the dwarves, improving his reputation with them. The goblins and [[Warg (Middle-earth)|Wargs]] give chase, but the company are saved by [[Eagles (Middle-earth)|eagles]] before resting in the house of [[Beorn]].\n\nThe company enters the black forest of [[Mirkwood]] without Gandalf. In Mirkwood, Bilbo first saves the dwarves from giant spiders and then from the dungeons of the [[Silvan Elves|Wood-elves]]. Nearing the Lonely Mountain, the travellers are welcomed by the human inhabitants of [[Esgaroth|Lake-town]], who hope the dwarves will fulfil prophecies of Smaug's demise. The expedition travels to the Lonely Mountain and finds the secret door; Bilbo scouts the dragon's lair, stealing the Arkenstone and spying a gap in Smaug's armour. The enraged dragon, deducing that Lake-town has aided the intruder, sets out to destroy the town. A [[Thrush (bird)|thrush]] had overheard Bilbo's report of Smaug's vulnerability and reports it to Lake-town defender [[Bard the Bowman|Bard]]. Bard's arrow finds the hollow spot and slays the dragon.\n\nWhen the dwarves take possession of the mountain, Bilbo finds the Arkenstone, an heirloom of Thorin's family, and hides it away. The Wood-elves and Lake-men besiege the mountain and request compensation for their aid, reparations for Lake-town's destruction, and settlement of old claims on the treasure. Thorin refuses and, having summoned his kin from the [[Iron Hills]], reinforces his position. Bilbo tries to ransom the Arkenstone to head off a war, but Thorin is only enraged at the betrayal. He banishes Bilbo, and battle seems inevitable.\n\nGandalf reappears to warn all of an approaching army of goblins and Wargs. The dwarves, men and elves band together, but only with the timely arrival of the eagles and Beorn do they win the climactic Battle of Five Armies. Thorin is fatally wounded and reconciles with Bilbo before he dies.\n\nBilbo accepts only a small portion of his share of the treasure, having no want or need for more, but still returns [[Bag End|home]] a very wealthy hobbit roughly a year and a month after he first left.\n\n==Concept and creation==\n\n===Background===\n{{Further|Hobbit (word)}}\nIn the early 1930s Tolkien was pursuing an academic career at Oxford as [[Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon]], with a fellowship at [[Pembroke College, Oxford|Pembroke College]]. Several of his poems had been published in magazines and small collections, including ''Goblin Feet''<ref>''Oxford Poetry'' (1915) Blackwells</ref> and ''[[The Man in the Moon Stayed Up Too Late|The Cat and the Fiddle: A Nursery Rhyme Undone and its Scandalous Secret Unlocked]]'',<ref>''Yorkshire Poetry'', Leeds, vol. 2, no. 19, October\u2013November 1923</ref> a reworking of the [[nursery rhyme]] ''[[Hey Diddle Diddle]]''. His creative endeavours at this time also included [[The Father Christmas Letters|letters from Father Christmas]] to his children\u2014illustrated manuscripts that featured warring [[gnome]]s and [[goblin]]s, and a helpful [[polar bear]]\u2014alongside the creation of [[Elvish languages (Middle-earth)|elven languages]] and an attendant mythology, including the [[Book of Lost Tales]], which he had been creating since 1917. These works all saw posthumous publication.<ref>{{harvnb|Rateliff|2007|pages=xxx\u2013xxxi}}</ref>\n\nIn a 1955 letter to [[W. H. Auden]], Tolkien recollects that he began work on ''The Hobbit'' one day early in the 1930s, when he was marking [[School Certificate (UK)|School Certificate]] papers. He found a blank page. Suddenly inspired, he wrote the words, \"In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.\" By late 1932 he had finished the story and then lent the manuscript to several friends, including [[C. S. Lewis]]<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1977|page=181}}</ref> and a student of Tolkien's named Elaine Griffiths.<ref name=\"Letter294\">{{harvnb|Carpenter|1981|page=294}}</ref> In 1936, when Griffiths was visited in Oxford by Susan Dagnall, a staff member of the publisher [[Allen & Unwin|George Allen & Unwin]], she is reported to have either lent Dagnall the book<ref name=\"Letter294\" /> or suggested she borrow it from Tolkien.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1977|page=184}}</ref> In any event, Dagnall was impressed by it, and showed the book to [[Stanley Unwin (publisher)|Stanley Unwin]], who then asked his 10-year-old son [[Rayner Unwin|Rayner]] to review it. Rayner's favourable comments settled Allen & Unwin's decision to publish Tolkien's book.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1977|page=192}}</ref>\n\n===Setting===\nThe setting of ''The Hobbit'', as described on its original dust jacket, is ''\"ancient time between the age of Faerie and the dominion of men\"'' in an unnamed [[fantasy world]].{{sfn|Tolkien|1937|loc=Inside dustjacket, first flap}} The world is shown on the endpaper map as \"Western Lands\" westward and \"[[Wilderland]]\" as the east. Originally this world was self-contained, but as Tolkien began work on ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', he decided these stories could fit into the [[Tolkien's legendarium|legendarium]] he had been working on privately for decades. ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'' became the end of the \"[[Third Age]]\" of [[Middle Earth]] within  [[Arda (Tolkien)|Arda]]. Eventually those tales of the earlier periods became published as ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' and other posthumous works.\n\n===Influences===\nOne of the greatest influences on Tolkien was the 19th-century [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts]] polymath [[William Morris]]. Tolkien wished to imitate Morris's prose and poetry romances,<ref name=\"Carpenter 1981 page=7\">{{Harvnb|Carpenter|1981|p=7}}</ref> following the general style and approach of the work. The Desolation of Smaug as portraying dragons as detrimental to landscape, has been noted as an explicit motif borrowed from Morris.<ref>{{harvnb|Rateliff|2007|page= vol.2 p.485}}</ref> Tolkien wrote also of being impressed as a boy by [[Samuel Rutherford Crockett]]'s historical novel ''[[The Black Douglas (novel)|The Black Douglas]]'' and of basing the Necromancer\u2014[[Sauron]]\u2014on its villain, [[Gilles de Retz]].<ref name=\"Carpenter 1981 page=391\">{{Harvnb|Carpenter|1981|p=391, quoted by {{Harvnb|Lobdell|2004|p=6}}}}</ref> Incidents in both ''The Hobbit'' and ''Lord of the Rings'' are similar in narrative and style to the novel,<ref>{{Harvnb|Tolkien|1988|p= 150}}</ref> and its overall style and imagery have been suggested as having had an influence on Tolkien.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lobdell |2004|pp=6\u20137}}</ref>\n\nTolkien's portrayal of goblins in ''The Hobbit'' was particularly influenced by [[George MacDonald]]'s ''[[The Princess and the Goblin]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Tolkien|2003|pages=108}}</ref> However, MacDonald influenced Tolkien more profoundly than just to shape individual characters and episodes; his works further helped Tolkien form his whole thinking on the role of fantasy within his Christian faith.<ref>{{harvnb|Drout|2007|pages=399\u2013400}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Jules verne cryptogramme.png|thumb|Verne's runic cryptogram from ''Journey to the Center of the Earth'']]\n\nTolkien scholar Mark T.

Tolkien, a scholar of ''Beowulf'', counted the epic among his \"most valued sources\" for ''The Hobbit''.<ref name=\"Carpenter 1981 page=31\">{{harvnb|Carpenter|1981|page=31}}</ref> Tolkien was one of the first critics to treat ''Beowulf'' as a literary work with value beyond the merely historical, and his 1936 lecture ''[[Beowulf: the Monsters and the Critics]]'' is still required in some Old English courses.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Tolkien borrowed several elements from ''Beowulf'', including a monstrous, intelligent dragon.<ref name=\"Steele\">{{cite journal | last =Steele | first =Felicia Jean | year =2006 | title =Dreaming of dragons: Tolkien's impact on Heaney's Beowulf | journal =Mythlore | issue =95/96 | url =http://dc.swosu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1294&context=mythlore|accessdate=3 December 2017}}</ref>  Certain descriptions in ''The Hobbit'' seem to have been lifted straight out of ''Beowulf'' with some minor rewording, such as when the dragon stretches its neck out to sniff for intruders.<ref>{{cite book | last=Faraci | first=Mary | editor-first=Jane | editor-last=Chance | title=Tolkien the Medievalist | publisher=Routledge |year=2002 | pages=58\u201359 | chapter='I wish to speak' (Tolkien's voice in his Beowulf essay) | isbn=978-0-415-28944-3 }}</ref> Likewise, Tolkien's descriptions of the lair as accessed through a secret passage mirror those in ''Beowulf''. Other specific plot elements and features in ''The Hobbit'' that show similarities to ''Beowulf'' include the title ''thief'', as Bilbo is called by Gollum and later by Smaug, and Smaug's personality, which leads to the destruction of Lake-town.<ref>{{Harvnb|Solopova|2009|page=37}}</ref> Tolkien refines parts of ''Beowulf''{{'s}} plot that he appears to have found less than satisfactorily described, such as details about the cup-thief and the dragon's intellect and personality.<ref>{{cite book |last=Purtill | first=Richard L. |authorlink=Richard Purtill | title=Lord of the Elves and Eldils | publisher=Ignatius Press |year=2006 |pages=53\u201355 | isbn=978-1-58617-084-4 |url=}}</ref>\n\nAnother influence from Old English sources is the appearance of named blades of renown, adorned in runes. In using his elf-blade Bilbo finally takes his first independent heroic action. By his naming the blade \"[[Sting (Middle-earth)|Sting]]\" we see Bilbo's acceptance of the kinds of cultural and linguistic practices found in ''Beowulf'', signifying his entrance into the ancient world in which he found himself.<ref>{{cite journal | last = McDonald | first = R.

The encounter ends with Gollum's curse, \"Thief! Thief, Thief, Baggins!

In ''The Annotated Hobbit'', Douglas Anderson provides the text of the published book alongside commentary and illustrations. Later editions added the text of \"[[The Quest of Erebor]]\". Anderson's commentary makes note of the sources Tolkien brought together in preparing the text, and chronicles the changes Tolkien made to the published editions. The text is also accompanied by illustrations from foreign language editions, among them work by [[Tove Jansson]].<ref>An example, alongside other illustrations can be seen at: [http://www.houghtonmifflinbooks.com/features/lordoftheringstrilogy/hobbit/2_5.shtml Houghton Mifflin]</ref> The edition also presents a number of little-known texts such as the 1923 version of Tolkien's poem \"Iumonna Gold Galdre Bewunden\".\n\nWith ''[[The History of The Hobbit]]'', published in two parts in 2007, [[John D. Rateliff]] provides the full text of the earliest and intermediary drafts of the book, alongside commentary that shows relationships to Tolkien's scholarly and creative works, both contemporary and later. Rateliff provides the abandoned 1960s retelling and previously unpublished illustrations by Tolkien. The book separates commentary from Tolkien's text, allowing the reader to read the original drafts as self-contained stories.<ref name=\"Fisher\"/>\n\n===Illustration and design===\nTolkien's correspondence and publisher's records show that he was involved in the design and illustration of the entire book. All elements were the subject of considerable correspondence and fussing over by Tolkien. Rayner Unwin, in his publishing memoir, comments: \"In 1937 alone Tolkien wrote 26 letters to George Allen & Unwin... detailed, fluent, often pungent, but infinitely polite and exasperatingly precise... I doubt any author today, however famous, would get such scrupulous attention.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Tolkien|2003|page=14}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Hobbit runes.png|alt=See caption.|thumb|[[Cirth]] runes and the English letter values assigned to them by Tolkien,<ref>{{harvnb|Tolkien|2003|pages=378\u2013379}}</ref> used in several of his original illustrations and designs for ''The Hobbit''.]]\n\nEven the maps, of which Tolkien originally proposed five, were considered and debated. He wished ''Thror's Map'' to be tipped in (that is, glued in after the book has been bound) at first mention in the text, and with the ''moon letter'' [[Cirth]] on the reverse so they could be seen when held up to the light.<ref name=\"Anderson 2003 page=22\"/> In the end the cost, as well as the shading of the maps, which would be difficult to reproduce, resulted in the final design of two maps as endpapers, ''Thror's map'', and the ''Map of Wilderland'' (see [[Rhovanion]]), both printed in black and red on the paper's cream background.<ref>{{harvnb|Hammond|Anderson|1993|page=18}}</ref>\n\nOriginally Allen & Unwin planned to illustrate the book only with the endpaper maps, but Tolkien's first tendered sketches so charmed the publisher's staff that they opted to include them without raising the book's price despite the extra cost. Thus encouraged, Tolkien supplied a second batch of illustrations. The publisher accepted all of these as well, giving the first edition ten black-and-white illustrations plus the two endpaper maps. The illustrated scenes were: ''The Hill: Hobbiton-across-the-Water'', ''The [[Troll (Middle-earth)|Trolls]]'', ''The Mountain Path'', ''The [[Misty Mountains]] looking West from the Eyrie towards Goblin Gate'', ''[[Beorn]]'s Hall'', ''[[Mirkwood]]'', ''[[Thranduil|The Elvenking]]'s Gate'', ''[[Esgaroth|Lake Town]]'', ''The [[Lonely Mountain|Front Gate]]'', and ''The Hall at [[Bag End|Bag-End]]''. All but one of the illustrations were a full page, and one, the Mirkwood illustration, required a separate plate.<ref>{{harvnb|Hammond|Anderson|1993|pages=10\u201311}}</ref>\n\nSatisfied with his skills, the publishers asked Tolkien to design a dust jacket. This project, too, became the subject of many iterations and much correspondence, with Tolkien always writing disparagingly of his own ability to draw. The runic inscription around the edges of the illustration are a phonetic [[transliteration]] of English, giving the title of the book and details of the author and publisher.<ref>{{cite book | last=Flieger | first=Verlyn |authorlink=Verlyn Flieger | title=Interrupted Music: The Making of Tolkien's Mythology | publisher=Kent State University Press | year= 2005 | isbn=978-0-87338-824-5 | page=67}}</ref> The original jacket design contained several shades of various colours, but Tolkien redrew it several times using fewer colours each time. His final design consisted of four colours. The publishers, mindful of the cost, removed the red from the sun to end up with only black, blue, and green ink on white stock.<ref name=Hammond12-13>{{harvnb|Hammond|Anderson|1993|pages=12\u201313}}</ref>\n\nThe publisher's production staff designed a binding, but Tolkien objected to several elements. Through several iterations, the final design ended up as mostly the author's. The spine shows runes: two \"[[Thurisaz (rune)|\u00fe]]\" ([[Thr\u00e1in II|Thr\u00e1in]] and Thr\u00f3r) runes and one \"[[Dagaz|d]]\" (door). The front and back covers were mirror images of each other, with an elongated dragon characteristic of Tolkien's style stamped along the lower edge, and with a sketch of the Misty Mountains stamped along the upper edge.<ref name=\"Hammond 1993 page=14\">{{harvnb|Hammond|Anderson|1993|page=14}}</ref>\n\nOnce illustrations were approved for the book, Tolkien proposed colour plates as well. The publisher would not relent on this, so Tolkien pinned his hopes on the American edition to be published about six months later. Houghton Mifflin rewarded these hopes with the replacement of the frontispiece (''The Hill: Hobbiton-across-the Water'') in colour and the addition of new colour plates: ''Rivendell'', ''Bilbo Woke Up with the Early Sun in His Eyes'', ''Bilbo comes to the Huts of the Raft-elves'' and ''Conversation with [[Smaug]]'', which features a [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|dwarvish]] curse written in Tolkien's invented script [[Tengwar]], and signed with two \"\u00fe\" (\"Th\") runes.<ref>{{harvnb|Rateliff|2007|page=602}}</ref> The additional illustrations proved so appealing that George Allen & Unwin adopted the colour plates as well for their second printing, with exception of ''Bilbo Woke Up with the Early Sun in His Eyes''.<ref name=\"Hammond 1993 page=20\">{{harvnb|Hammond|Anderson|1993|page=20}}</ref>\n\nDifferent editions have been illustrated in diverse ways. Many follow the original scheme at least loosely, but many others are illustrated by other artists, especially the many translated editions.

An important concept in [[anthropology]] and [[child development]], animism is the idea that all things\u2014including inanimate objects and natural events, such as storms or purses, as well as living things like animals and plants\u2014possess human-like intelligence. John D. Rateliff calls this the \"[[Doctor Dolittle]] Theme\" in ''The History of the Hobbit'', and cites the multitude of talking animals as indicative of this theme. These talking creatures include ravens, a thrush, spiders and the dragon Smaug, alongside the anthropomorphic goblins and elves. Patrick Curry notes that animism is also found in Tolkien's other works, and mentions the \"roots of mountains\" and \"feet of trees\" in ''The Hobbit'' as a linguistic shifting in level from the inanimate to animate.<ref name=\"curry\">{{cite book | last = Curry | first = Patrick | year = 2004 |title =Defending Middle-earth: Tolkien: Myth and Modernity | publisher=Mariner Books | isbn=978-0-618-47885-9| page =98 |url= }}</ref> Tolkien saw the idea of animism as closely linked to the emergence of human language and myth: \"...The first men to talk of 'trees and stars' saw things very differently.

He portrays Bilbo as a modern [[anachronism]] exploring an essentially antique world. Bilbo is able to negotiate and interact within this antique world because language and tradition make connections between the two worlds. For example, [[Gollum]]'s riddles are taken from old historical sources, while those of Bilbo come from modern nursery books. It is the form of the riddle game, familiar to both, which allows Gollum and Bilbo to engage each other, rather than the content of the riddles themselves. This idea of a superficial contrast between characters' individual linguistic style, tone and sphere of interest, leading to an understanding of the deeper unity between the ancient and modern, is a recurring theme in ''The Hobbit''.<ref name=\"Shippey_Author\">{{cite book|last=Shippey |first=Tom|authorlink=Tom Shippey|title=J.

In many ways the Smaug episode reflects and references the dragon of ''[[Beowulf]]'', and Tolkien uses the episode to put into practice some of the ground-breaking literary theories he had developed about the Old English poem in its portrayal of the dragon as having bestial intelligence.<ref name=\"Steele\"/> Tolkien greatly prefers this motif over the later medieval trend of using the dragon as a symbolic or allegorical figure, such as in the legend of [[Saint George and the Dragon|St. George]].<ref>{{harvnb|Rateliff|2007|page=534}}</ref> Smaug the dragon with his golden hoard may be seen as an example of the traditional relationship between evil and metallurgy as collated in the depiction of [[Pand\u00e6monium (Paradise Lost)|Pand\u00e6monium]] with its \"Belched fire and rolling smoke\" in [[John Milton|Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]''.<ref name=\"compass\">{{cite book| last=Lobdell | first=Jared | year=1975 | title=A Tolkien Compass | publisher=Open Court Publishing | page=[https://archive.org/details/tolkiencompass00lobd/page/106 106] | isbn=978-0-87548-303-0 | url=https://archive.org/details/tolkiencompass00lobd/page/106 }}</ref> Of all the characters, Smaug's speech is the most modern, using [[idiom]]s such as \"Don't let your imagination run away with you!\"\n\nJust as Tolkien's literary theories have been seen to influence the tale, so have Tolkien's experiences.

[[C. S. Lewis]], friend of Tolkien (and later author of ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' between 1949 and 1954), writing in ''The Times'' reports:\n\n<blockquote>The truth is that in this book a number of good things, never before united, have come together: a fund of humour, an understanding of children, and a happy fusion of the scholar's with the poet's grasp of mythology... The professor has the air of inventing nothing. He has studied trolls and dragons at first hand and describes them with that fidelity that is worth oceans of glib \"originality.\"</blockquote>\n\nLewis compares the book to ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland|Alice in Wonderland]]'' in that both children and adults may find different things to enjoy in it, and places it alongside ''[[Flatland]]'', ''[[Phantastes]]'', and ''[[The Wind in the Willows]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Tolkien|2003|page=18}}</ref> [[W.

Instead of approaching ''The Hobbit'' as a children's book in its own right, critics such as Randell Helms picked up on the idea of ''The Hobbit'' as being a \"prelude\", relegating the story to a dry-run for the later work. Countering a [[Presentism (literary and historical analysis)|presentist]] interpretation are those who say this approach misses out on much of the original's value as a children's book and as a work of high fantasy in its own right, and that it disregards the book's influence on these genres.<ref name=\"Sullivan\">{{cite book|title=International Companion Encyclopedia of Children's Literature |editor=Hunt, Peter |last=Sullivan |first=C.

The plots share the same basic structure progressing in the same sequence: the stories begin at Bag End, the home of Bilbo Baggins; Bilbo hosts a party that sets the novel's main plot into motion; Gandalf sends the protagonist into a quest eastward; Elrond offers a haven and advice; the adventurers escape dangerous creatures underground ([[Goblin Town]]/[[Moria (Middle-earth)|Moria]]); they engage another group of elves ([[Mirkwood]]/[[Lothl\u00f3rien]]); they traverse a desolate region (Desolation of Smaug/the [[Dead Marshes]]); they are received and nourished by a small settlement of men ([[Esgaroth]]/[[Ithilien]]); they fight in a massive battle (The Battle of Five Armies/[[Battle of Pelennor Fields]]); their journey climaxes within an infamous mountain peak ([[Lonely Mountain]]/[[Mount Doom]]); a descendant of kings is restored to his ancestral throne ([[Bard the Bowman|Bard]]/[[Aragorn]]); and the questing party returns home to find it in a deteriorated condition (having possessions auctioned off / [[the Scouring of the Shire]]).<ref name=\"Kocher\">\n{{cite book |title= Master of Middle-earth, the Achievement of J. R. R. Tolkien|last= Kocher |first= Paul |year= 1974 |publisher=Penguin |pages= 31\u201332}}</ref>\n\n''The Lord of the Rings'' contains several more supporting scenes, and has a more sophisticated plot structure, following the paths of multiple characters. Tolkien wrote the later story in much less humorous tones and infused it with more complex moral and philosophical themes. The differences between the two stories can cause difficulties when readers, expecting them to be similar, find that they are not.<ref name=\"Kocher\"/> Many of the thematic and stylistic differences arose because Tolkien wrote ''The Hobbit'' as a story for children, and ''The Lord of the Rings'' for the same audience, who had subsequently grown up since its publication. Further, Tolkien's concept of [[Middle-earth]] was to continually change and slowly evolve throughout his life and writings.<ref>{{cite book |title= The History of Middle-earth: Vol 1 \"The Book of Lost Tales 1\"|last= Tolkien|first= Christopher |year=1983 |publisher=George Allen & Unwin |isbn=978-0-04-823238-0 |page= 7}}</ref>\n\n===In education===\nThe style and themes of the book have been seen to help stretch young readers' literacy skills, preparing them to approach the works of [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]] and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]].

R. R. Tolkien]]. It was published on 21 September 1937 to wide critical acclaim, being nominated for the [[Carnegie Medal (literary award)|Carnegie Medal]] and awarded a prize from the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'' for best juvenile fiction. The book remains popular and is recognized as a classic in children's literature.\n\n''The Hobbit'' is set within Tolkien's [[fictional universe]] and follows the quest of home-loving [[Bilbo Baggins]], the titular [[hobbit]], to win a share of the treasure guarded by [[Smaug]] the [[Dragon (Middle-earth)|dragon]]. Bilbo's journey takes him from light-hearted, rural surroundings into more sinister territory.\n\nThe story is told in the form of an episodic quest, and most chapters introduce a specific creature or type of creature of Tolkien's geography. Bilbo gains a new level of maturity, competence, and wisdom by accepting the disreputable, romantic, fey, and adventurous sides of his nature and applying his wits and common sense. The story reaches its climax in the Battle of Five Armies, where many of the characters and creatures from earlier chapters re-emerge to engage in conflict.\n\nPersonal growth and forms of heroism are central themes of the story, along with motifs of warfare. These themes have led critics to view [[J. R. R. Tolkien#First World War|Tolkien's own experiences during World War I]] as instrumental in shaping the story. The author's scholarly knowledge of [[Germanic philology]] and interest in mythology and [[fairy tales]] are often noted as influences.\n\nThe publisher was encouraged by the book's critical and financial success and, therefore, requested a sequel. As Tolkien's work progressed on the successor ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', he made retrospective accommodations for it in ''The Hobbit''. These few but significant changes were integrated into the second edition. Further editions followed with minor emendations, including those reflecting Tolkien's changing concept of the world into which Bilbo stumbled.\n\nThe work has never been out of print. Its ongoing legacy encompasses many adaptations for stage, screen, radio, board games, and video games. Several of these adaptations have received critical recognition on their own merits.\n\n==Characters==\n{{Main|List of The Hobbit characters}}[[Bilbo Baggins]], the titular protagonist, is a respectable, reserved [[hobbit]]\u2014a race resembling very short humans who live in underground houses and are mainly pastoral farmers and gardeners.<ref>{{cite book|title=Red Riding Hood and the Wolf in Bed: Modernism's Fairy Tales |first=Ann |last=Martin |publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]] |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-8020-9086-7 |quote=... \u2014prefigure the bourgeois preoccupations of J.

When the music ends, Gandalf unveils Thr\u00f3r's map showing a [[secret door]] into the Mountain and proposes that the dumbfounded Bilbo serve as the expedition's \"burglar\". The dwarves ridicule the idea, but Bilbo, indignant, joins despite himself.\n\nThe group travels into the wild, where Gandalf saves the company from [[Troll (Middle-earth)|trolls]] and leads them to [[Rivendell]], where [[Elrond]] reveals more secrets from the map. When they attempt to cross the [[Misty Mountains]] they are caught by [[Orc (Middle-earth)|goblins]] and driven [[Goblin Town|deep underground]]. Although Gandalf rescues them, Bilbo gets separated from the others as they flee the goblins. Lost in the goblin tunnels, he stumbles across [[One Ring|a mysterious ring]] and then encounters [[Gollum]], who engages him in a game of riddles. As a reward for solving all riddles Gollum will show him the path out of the tunnels, but if Bilbo fails, his life will be forfeit. With the help of the ring, which confers [[invisibility]], Bilbo escapes and rejoins the dwarves, improving his reputation with them. The goblins and [[Warg (Middle-earth)|Wargs]] give chase, but the company are saved by [[Eagles (Middle-earth)|eagles]] before resting in the house of [[Beorn]].\n\nThe company enters the black forest of [[Mirkwood]] without Gandalf. In Mirkwood, Bilbo first saves the dwarves from giant spiders and then from the dungeons of the [[Silvan Elves|Wood-elves]]. Nearing the Lonely Mountain, the travellers are welcomed by the human inhabitants of [[Esgaroth|Lake-town]], who hope the dwarves will fulfil prophecies of Smaug's demise. The expedition travels to the Lonely Mountain and finds the secret door; Bilbo scouts the dragon's lair, stealing a great cup and espying a gap in Smaug's armour. The enraged dragon, deducing that Lake-town has aided the intruder, sets out to destroy the town. A [[Thrush (bird)|thrush]] had overheard Bilbo's report of Smaug's vulnerability and reports it to Lake-town defender [[Bard the Bowman|Bard]]. Bard's arrow finds the hollow spot and slays the dragon.\n\nWhen the dwarves take possession of the mountain, Bilbo finds the Arkenstone, an heirloom of Thorin's family, and hides it away. The Wood-elves and Lake-men besiege the mountain and request compensation for their aid, reparations for Lake-town's destruction, and settlement of old claims on the treasure. Thorin refuses and, having summoned his kin from the [[Iron Hills]], reinforces his position. Bilbo tries to ransom the Arkenstone to head off a war, but Thorin is only enraged at the betrayal. He banishes Bilbo, and battle seems inevitable.\n\nGandalf reappears to warn all of an approaching army of goblins and Wargs. The dwarves, men and elves band together, but only with the timely arrival of the eagles and Beorn do they win the climactic Battle of Five Armies. Thorin is fatally wounded and reconciles with Bilbo before he dies.\n\nBilbo accepts only a small portion of his share of the treasure, having no want or need for more, but still returns [[Bag End|home]] a very wealthy hobbit roughly a year and a month after he first left.\n\n==Concept and creation==\n\n===Background===\n{{Further|Hobbit (word)}}\nIn the early 1930s Tolkien was pursuing an academic career at Oxford as [[Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon]], with a fellowship at [[Pembroke College, Oxford|Pembroke College]]. Several of his poems had been published in magazines and small collections, including ''Goblin Feet''<ref>''Oxford Poetry'' (1915) Blackwells</ref> and ''[[The Man in the Moon Stayed Up Too Late|The Cat and the Fiddle: A Nursery Rhyme Undone and its Scandalous Secret Unlocked]]'',<ref>''Yorkshire Poetry'', Leeds, vol. 2, no. 19, October\u2013November 1923</ref> a reworking of the [[nursery rhyme]] ''[[Hey Diddle Diddle]]''. His creative endeavours at this time also included [[The Father Christmas Letters|letters from Father Christmas]] to his children\u2014illustrated manuscripts that featured warring [[gnome]]s and [[goblin]]s, and a helpful [[polar bear]]\u2014alongside the creation of [[Elvish languages (Middle-earth)|elven languages]] and an attendant mythology, including the [[Book of Lost Tales]], which he had been creating since 1917. These works all saw posthumous publication.<ref>{{harvnb|Rateliff|2007|pages=xxx\u2013xxxi}}</ref>\n\nIn a 1955 letter to [[W. H. Auden]], Tolkien recollects that he began work on ''The Hobbit'' one day early in the 1930s, when he was marking [[School Certificate (UK)|School Certificate]] papers. He found a blank page. Suddenly inspired, he wrote the words, \"In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.\" By late 1932 he had finished the story and then lent the manuscript to several friends, including [[C. S. Lewis]]<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1977|page=181}}</ref> and a student of Tolkien's named Elaine Griffiths.<ref name=\"Letter294\">{{harvnb|Carpenter|1981|page=294}}</ref> In 1936, when Griffiths was visited in Oxford by Susan Dagnall, a staff member of the publisher [[Allen & Unwin|George Allen & Unwin]], she is reported to have either lent Dagnall the book<ref name=\"Letter294\" /> or suggested she borrow it from Tolkien.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1977|page=184}}</ref> In any event, Dagnall was impressed by it, and showed the book to [[Stanley Unwin (publisher)|Stanley Unwin]], who then asked his 10-year-old son [[Rayner Unwin|Rayner]] to review it. Rayner's favourable comments settled Allen & Unwin's decision to publish Tolkien's book.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1977|page=192}}</ref>\n\n===Setting===\nThe setting of ''The Hobbit'', as described on its original dust jacket, is ''\"ancient time between the age of Faerie and the dominion of men\"'' in an unnamed [[fantasy world]].{{sfn|Tolkien|1937|loc=Inside dustjacket, first flap}} The world is shown on the endpaper map as \"Western Lands\" westward and \"[[Wilderland]]\" as the east. Originally this world was self-contained, but as Tolkien began work on ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', he decided these stories could fit into the [[Tolkien's legendarium|legendarium]] he had been working on privately for decades. ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'' became the end of the \"[[Third Age]]\" of [[Middle Earth]] within  [[Arda (Tolkien)|Arda]]. Eventually those tales of the earlier periods became published as ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' and other posthumous works.\n\n===Influences===\nOne of the greatest influences on Tolkien was the 19th-century [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts]] polymath [[William Morris]]. Tolkien wished to imitate Morris's prose and poetry romances,<ref name=\"Carpenter 1981 page=7\">{{Harvnb|Carpenter|1981|p=7}}</ref> following the general style and approach of the work. The Desolation of Smaug as portraying dragons as detrimental to landscape, has been noted as an explicit motif borrowed from Morris.<ref>{{harvnb|Rateliff|2007|page= vol.2 p.485}}</ref> Tolkien wrote also of being impressed as a boy by [[Samuel Rutherford Crockett]]'s historical novel ''[[The Black Douglas (novel)|The Black Douglas]]'' and of basing the Necromancer\u2014[[Sauron]]\u2014on its villain, [[Gilles de Retz]].<ref name=\"Carpenter 1981 page=391\">{{Harvnb|Carpenter|1981|p=391, quoted by {{Harvnb|Lobdell|2004|p=6}}}}</ref> Incidents in both ''The Hobbit'' and ''Lord of the Rings'' are similar in narrative and style to the novel,<ref>{{Harvnb|Tolkien|1988|p= 150}}</ref> and its overall style and imagery have been suggested as having had an influence on Tolkien.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lobdell |2004|pp=6\u20137}}</ref>\n\nTolkien's portrayal of goblins in ''The Hobbit'' was particularly influenced by [[George MacDonald]]'s ''[[The Princess and the Goblin]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Tolkien|2003|pages=108}}</ref> However, MacDonald influenced Tolkien more profoundly than just to shape individual characters and episodes; his works further helped Tolkien form his whole thinking on the role of fantasy within his Christian faith.<ref>{{harvnb|Drout|2007|pages=399\u2013400}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Jules verne cryptogramme.png|thumb|Verne's runic cryptogram from ''Journey to the Center of the Earth'']]\n\nTolkien scholar Mark T.

The encounter ends with Gollum's curse, \"Thief! Thief, Thief, Baggins! We hates it, we hates it, we hates it forever!\" This presages Gollum's portrayal in ''The Lord of the Rings''.\n\nTolkien sent this revised version of the chapter \"Riddles in the Dark\" to Unwin as an example of the kinds of changes needed to bring the book into conformity with ''The Lord of the Rings'', but he heard nothing back for years. When he was sent [[galley proof]]s of a new edition, Tolkien was surprised to find the sample text had been incorporated.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1977|page=215}}</ref> In ''The Lord of the Rings'', the original version of the riddle game is explained as a \"lie\" made up by Bilbo under the harmful influence of the Ring, whereas the revised version contains the \"true\" account.<ref name = \"prologue\">{{cite book|last=Tolkien |first=J.

However, because of its common denotation of a [[garden gnome]], derived from the 16th-century [[Paracelsus]], Tolkien abandoned the term.<ref>{{cite book |title= The History of Middle-earth: Vol 1 \"The Book of Lost Tales 1\"|last= Tolkien|first= Christopher |year=1983 |publisher=George Allen & Unwin |isbn=978-0-04-823238-0 |pages= 43\u201344}}</ref> He also changed \"tomatoes\" to \"pickles\" but retained other anachronisms, such as clocks and tobacco. In ''The Lord of the Rings'', he has [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] explain that tobacco had been brought from the West by the [[Numenoreans|N\u00famen\u00f3reans]].\n\n====Posthumous editions====\nSince the author's death, two editions of ''The Hobbit'' have been published with commentary on the creation, emendation and development of the text. In ''The Annotated Hobbit'', Douglas Anderson provides the text of the published book alongside commentary and illustrations. Later editions added the text of \"[[The Quest of Erebor]]\". Anderson's commentary makes note of the sources Tolkien brought together in preparing the text, and chronicles the changes Tolkien made to the published editions. The text is also accompanied by illustrations from foreign language editions, among them work by [[Tove Jansson]].<ref>An example, alongside other illustrations can be seen at: [http://www.houghtonmifflinbooks.com/features/lordoftheringstrilogy/hobbit/2_5.shtml Houghton Mifflin]</ref> The edition also presents a number of little-known texts such as the 1923 version of Tolkien's poem \"Iumonna Gold Galdre Bewunden\".\n\nWith ''[[The History of The Hobbit]]'', published in two parts in 2007, [[John D. Rateliff]] provides the full text of the earliest and intermediary drafts of the book, alongside commentary that shows relationships to Tolkien's scholarly and creative works, both contemporary and later. Rateliff provides the abandoned 1960s retelling and previously unpublished illustrations by Tolkien. The book separates commentary from Tolkien's text, allowing the reader to read the original drafts as self-contained stories.<ref name=\"Fisher\"/>\n\n===Illustration and design===\nTolkien's correspondence and publisher's records show that he was involved in the design and illustration of the entire book. All elements were the subject of considerable correspondence and fussing over by Tolkien. Rayner Unwin, in his publishing memoir, comments: \"In 1937 alone Tolkien wrote 26 letters to George Allen & Unwin... detailed, fluent, often pungent, but infinitely polite and exasperatingly precise... I doubt any author today, however famous, would get such scrupulous attention.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Tolkien|2003|page=14}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Hobbit runes.png|alt=See caption.|thumb|[[Cirth]] runes and the English letter values assigned to them by Tolkien,<ref>{{harvnb|Tolkien|2003|pages=378\u2013379}}</ref> used in several of his original illustrations and designs for ''The Hobbit''.]]\n\nEven the maps, of which Tolkien originally proposed five, were considered and debated. He wished ''Thror's Map'' to be tipped in (that is, glued in after the book has been bound) at first mention in the text, and with the ''moon letter'' [[Cirth]] on the reverse so they could be seen when held up to the light.<ref name=\"Anderson 2003 page=22\"/> In the end the cost, as well as the shading of the maps, which would be difficult to reproduce, resulted in the final design of two maps as endpapers, ''Thror's map'', and the ''Map of Wilderland'' (see [[Rhovanion]]), both printed in black and red on the paper's cream background.<ref>{{harvnb|Hammond|Anderson|1993|page=18}}</ref>\n\nOriginally Allen & Unwin planned to illustrate the book only with the endpaper maps, but Tolkien's first tendered sketches so charmed the publisher's staff that they opted to include them without raising the book's price despite the extra cost. Thus encouraged, Tolkien supplied a second batch of illustrations. The publisher accepted all of these as well, giving the first edition ten black-and-white illustrations plus the two endpaper maps. The illustrated scenes were: ''The Hill: Hobbiton-across-the-Water'', ''The [[Troll (Middle-earth)|Trolls]]'', ''The Mountain Path'', ''The [[Misty Mountains]] looking West from the Eyrie towards Goblin Gate'', ''[[Beorn]]'s Hall'', ''[[Mirkwood]]'', ''[[Thranduil|The Elvenking]]'s Gate'', ''[[Esgaroth|Lake Town]]'', ''The [[Lonely Mountain|Front Gate]]'', and ''The Hall at [[Bag End|Bag-End]]''. All but one of the illustrations were a full page, and one, the Mirkwood illustration, required a separate plate.<ref>{{harvnb|Hammond|Anderson|1993|pages=10\u201311}}</ref>\n\nSatisfied with his skills, the publishers asked Tolkien to design a dust jacket. This project, too, became the subject of many iterations and much correspondence, with Tolkien always writing disparagingly of his own ability to draw. The runic inscription around the edges of the illustration are a phonetic [[transliteration]] of English, giving the title of the book and details of the author and publisher.<ref>{{cite book | last=Flieger | first=Verlyn |authorlink=Verlyn Flieger | title=Interrupted Music: The Making of Tolkien's Mythology | publisher=Kent State University Press | year= 2005 | isbn=978-0-87338-824-5 | page=67}}</ref> The original jacket design contained several shades of various colours, but Tolkien redrew it several times using fewer colours each time. His final design consisted of four colours. The publishers, mindful of the cost, removed the red from the sun to end up with only black, blue, and green ink on white stock.<ref name=Hammond12-13>{{harvnb|Hammond|Anderson|1993|pages=12\u201313}}</ref>\n\nThe publisher's production staff designed a binding, but Tolkien objected to several elements. Through several iterations, the final design ended up as mostly the author's. The spine shows runes: two \"[[Thurisaz (rune)|\u00fe]]\" ([[Thr\u00e1in II|Thr\u00e1in]] and Thr\u00f3r) runes and one \"[[Dagaz|d]]\" (door). The front and back covers were mirror images of each other, with an elongated dragon characteristic of Tolkien's style stamped along the lower edge, and with a sketch of the Misty Mountains stamped along the upper edge.<ref name=\"Hammond 1993 page=14\">{{harvnb|Hammond|Anderson|1993|page=14}}</ref>\n\nOnce illustrations were approved for the book, Tolkien proposed colour plates as well. The publisher would not relent on this, so Tolkien pinned his hopes on the American edition to be published about six months later. Houghton Mifflin rewarded these hopes with the replacement of the frontispiece (''The Hill: Hobbiton-across-the Water'') in colour and the addition of new colour plates: ''Rivendell'', ''Bilbo Woke Up with the Early Sun in His Eyes'', ''Bilbo comes to the Huts of the Raft-elves'' and ''Conversation with [[Smaug]]'', which features a [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|dwarvish]] curse written in Tolkien's invented script [[Tengwar]], and signed with two \"\u00fe\" (\"Th\") runes.<ref>{{harvnb|Rateliff|2007|page=602}}</ref> The additional illustrations proved so appealing that George Allen & Unwin adopted the colour plates as well for their second printing, with exception of ''Bilbo Woke Up with the Early Sun in His Eyes''.<ref name=\"Hammond 1993 page=20\">{{harvnb|Hammond|Anderson|1993|page=20}}</ref>\n\nDifferent editions have been illustrated in diverse ways. Many follow the original scheme at least loosely, but many others are illustrated by other artists, especially the many translated editions. Some cheaper editions, particularly paperback, are not illustrated except with the maps. \"The Children's Book Club\" edition of 1942 includes the black-and-white pictures but no maps, an anomaly.<ref name=\"cbc\">{{cite book | last=Tolkien | first=J.

An important concept in [[anthropology]] and [[child development]], animism is the idea that all things\u2014including inanimate objects and natural events, such as storms or purses, as well as living things like animals and plants\u2014possess human-like intelligence. John D. Rateliff calls this the \"[[Doctor Dolittle]] Theme\" in ''The History of the Hobbit'', and cites the multitude of talking animals as indicative of this theme. These talking creatures include ravens, a thrush, spiders and the dragon Smaug, alongside the anthropomorphic goblins and elves. Patrick Curry notes that animism is also found in Tolkien's other works, and mentions the \"roots of mountains\" and \"feet of trees\" in ''The Hobbit'' as a linguistic shifting in level from the inanimate to animate.<ref name=\"curry\">{{cite book | last = Curry | first = Patrick | year = 2004 |title =Defending Middle-earth: Tolkien: Myth and Modernity | publisher=Mariner Books | isbn=978-0-618-47885-9| page =98 |url= }}</ref> Tolkien saw the idea of animism as closely linked to the emergence of human language and myth: \"...The first men to talk of 'trees and stars' saw things very differently. To them, the world was alive with mythological beings... To them the whole of creation was 'myth-woven and elf-patterned'.\"<ref>{{cite book| title = The Inklings: C. S. Lewis, J. R. R.

He portrays Bilbo as a modern [[anachronism]] exploring an essentially antique world. Bilbo is able to negotiate and interact within this antique world because language and tradition make connections between the two worlds. For example, [[Gollum]]'s riddles are taken from old historical sources, while those of Bilbo come from modern nursery books. It is the form of the riddle game, familiar to both, which allows Gollum and Bilbo to engage each other, rather than the content of the riddles themselves. This idea of a superficial contrast between characters' individual linguistic style, tone and sphere of interest, leading to an understanding of the deeper unity between the ancient and modern, is a recurring theme in ''The Hobbit''.<ref name=\"Shippey_Author\">{{cite book|last=Shippey |first=Tom|authorlink=Tom Shippey|title=J.

Tolkien: Author of the Century}}</ref>\n\n[[Smaug]] is the main antagonist. In many ways the Smaug episode reflects and references the dragon of ''[[Beowulf]]'', and Tolkien uses the episode to put into practice some of the ground-breaking literary theories he had developed about the Old English poem in its portrayal of the dragon as having bestial intelligence.<ref name=\"Steele\"/> Tolkien greatly prefers this motif over the later medieval trend of using the dragon as a symbolic or allegorical figure, such as in the legend of [[Saint George and the Dragon|St. George]].<ref>{{harvnb|Rateliff|2007|page=534}}</ref> Smaug the dragon with his golden hoard may be seen as an example of the traditional relationship between evil and metallurgy as collated in the depiction of [[Pand\u00e6monium (Paradise Lost)|Pand\u00e6monium]] with its \"Belched fire and rolling smoke\" in [[John Milton|Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]''.<ref name=\"compass\">{{cite book| last=Lobdell | first=Jared | year=1975 | title=A Tolkien Compass | publisher=Open Court Publishing | page=[https://archive.org/details/tolkiencompass00lobd/page/106 106] | isbn=978-0-87548-303-0 | url=https://archive.org/details/tolkiencompass00lobd/page/106 }}</ref> Of all the characters, Smaug's speech is the most modern, using [[idiom]]s such as \"Don't let your imagination run away with you!\"\n\nJust as Tolkien's literary theories have been seen to influence the tale, so have Tolkien's experiences. ''The Hobbit'' may be read as Tolkien's parable of World War I with the hero being plucked from his rural home and thrown into a far-off war where traditional types of heroism are shown to be futile.<ref name=\"great_war_rev\">{{cite news |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/review-cover-book-tolkien-and-the-great-war-by-by-john-garth-80bcv8w75vs|title=Review: Cover book: Tolkien and the Great War by John Garth |last=Carpenter |first=Humphrey |date=23 November 2003 |newspaper=[[The Sunday Times]] |publisher=Times Newspapers Limited }}</ref> The tale as such explores the theme of heroism.

[[C. S. Lewis]], friend of Tolkien (and later author of ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' between 1949 and 1954), writing in ''The Times'' reports:\n\n<blockquote>The truth is that in this book a number of good things, never before united, have come together: a fund of humour, an understanding of children, and a happy fusion of the scholar's with the poet's grasp of mythology... The professor has the air of inventing nothing. He has studied trolls and dragons at first hand and describes them with that fidelity that is worth oceans of glib \"originality.\"</blockquote>\n\nLewis compares the book to ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland|Alice in Wonderland]]'' in that both children and adults may find different things to enjoy in it, and places it alongside ''[[Flatland]]'', ''[[Phantastes]]'', and ''[[The Wind in the Willows]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Tolkien|2003|page=18}}</ref> [[W.

Instead of approaching ''The Hobbit'' as a children's book in its own right, critics such as Randell Helms picked up on the idea of ''The Hobbit'' as being a \"prelude\", relegating the story to a dry-run for the later work. Countering a [[Presentism (literary and historical analysis)|presentist]] interpretation are those who say this approach misses out on much of the original's value as a children's book and as a work of high fantasy in its own right, and that it disregards the book's influence on these genres.<ref name=\"Sullivan\">{{cite book|title=International Companion Encyclopedia of Children's Literature |editor=Hunt, Peter |last=Sullivan |first=C.

The plots share the same basic structure progressing in the same sequence: the stories begin at Bag End, the home of Bilbo Baggins; Bilbo hosts a party that sets the novel's main plot into motion; Gandalf sends the protagonist into a quest eastward; Elrond offers a haven and advice; the adventurers escape dangerous creatures underground ([[Goblin Town]]/[[Moria (Middle-earth)|Moria]]); they engage another group of elves ([[Mirkwood]]/[[Lothl\u00f3rien]]); they traverse a desolate region (Desolation of Smaug/the [[Dead Marshes]]); they are received and nourished by a small settlement of men ([[Esgaroth]]/[[Ithilien]]); they fight in a massive battle (The Battle of Five Armies/[[Battle of Pelennor Fields]]); their journey climaxes within an infamous mountain peak ([[Lonely Mountain]]/[[Mount Doom]]); a descendant of kings is restored to his ancestral throne ([[Bard the Bowman|Bard]]/[[Aragorn]]); and the questing party returns home to find it in a deteriorated condition (having possessions auctioned off / [[the Scouring of the Shire]]).<ref name=\"Kocher\">\n{{cite book |title= Master of Middle-earth, the Achievement of J.

Tolkien wrote the later story in much less humorous tones and infused it with more complex moral and philosophical themes. The differences between the two stories can cause difficulties when readers, expecting them to be similar, find that they are not.<ref name=\"Kocher\"/> Many of the thematic and stylistic differences arose because Tolkien wrote ''The Hobbit'' as a story for children, and ''The Lord of the Rings'' for the same audience, who had subsequently grown up since its publication. Further, Tolkien's concept of [[Middle-earth]] was to continually change and slowly evolve throughout his life and writings.<ref>{{cite book |title= The History of Middle-earth: Vol 1 \"The Book of Lost Tales 1\"|last= Tolkien|first= Christopher |year=1983 |publisher=George Allen & Unwin |isbn=978-0-04-823238-0 |page= 7}}</ref>\n\n===In education===\nThe style and themes of the book have been seen to help stretch young readers' literacy skills, preparing them to approach the works of [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]] and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]].

At the time of the [[1991 Nepal census]] it had a population of 6750 people living in 1128 individual households.<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.digitalhimalaya.com/collections/nepalcensus/form.php?selection=1|title=Nepal Census 2001|work=Nepal's Village Development Committees|publisher=[[Digital Himalaya]]|accessdate=14 December 2008 }}</ref> By 2009, the population has exceeded 30,000.\n\nLocated just across Nepal's Chitwan National Park, Sukranagar is home to subsistence farmers who nominally live off the land using traditional farming practices. Being in the proximity of the national park, farmers here traditionally had a close relationship with the National Park. This relationship also invited some illegal transactions of [[forest product]]s and livestock grazing in the park, and illegal hunting and fishing, all despised by the conservation authorities. Similarly crop damage by [[wild animal]]s from the park have become a matter of concern for the local people. In various ways, there has been a reciprocal relationship between the park and local people.

Being in the proximity of the national park, farmers here traditionally had a close relationship with the National Park. This relationship also invited some illegal transactions of [[forest product]]s and livestock grazing in the park, and illegal hunting and fishing, all despised by the conservation authorities. Similarly crop damage by [[wild animal]]s from the park have become a matter of concern for the local people. In various ways, there has been a reciprocal relationship between the park and local people. The people settled adjacent to the park are dependent on its resources primarily due to absence of convenient alternatives. This means that there is a tremendous opportunity for thoughtful and resourceful people to develop alternative economic and agricultural practices that can positively exploit the proximity of the park and the rich combination of plants and animals that exist in the park.

The Gang of Eight were [[hard-line]] members of the Communist Party ([[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|CPSU]]) who were opposed to Gorbachev's reform program and the [[Union of Sovereign States|new union treaty]] he had negotiated, which dispersed much of the central government's power to the republics. The coup collapsed after only two days, and although Gorbachev was restored as President, his authority was irreparably damaged and he became less influential outside of Moscow. The event destabilized the Soviet Union and many speculate that it played a role in both the demise of the CPSU and the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]]. After the coup failed, the seven living members of the Gang of Eight were arrested.\n\n==Court trials==\nOn December 15, 1992, over a year after the attempted coup, the Prosecutor General sent the criminal case against the Gang of Eight to the Military Collegiate of the [[Supreme Court of the Russian Federation]]. Anatoliy Ukolov, a deputy chairman of the Collegiate, was charged with reviewing the case, and the hearing was scheduled for 26 January 1993. The defendants included the aforementioned seven living members of the group plus [[Oleg Shenin]] (1937\u20132009), Politburo and secretariat member; [[Anatoly Lukyanov]] (b. 1930), Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union; and [[Valentin Varennikov]] (1923\u20132009), General of the Army, Deputy Minister of Defense, and Commander of Land Forces.\n\nThe trials lasted more than ten months, from 14 April 1993 until 1 March 1994. They were open to the public and press; however, foreign press did not participate due to lack of space in the courtroom. A prosecution commission was assigned to the case by the Collegiate, consisting of nine people and headed by Denisov, a Deputy Prosecutor General. The defense attorneys, Genri Reznik (Shenin), Genrikh Padva, Yuriy Ivanov (Kryuchkov), and Dmitriy Shteinberg (Varennikov) were hired, but in total, there were seventeen defense attorneys. After various delay tactics staged by the defense, the trial began on 30 November 1993. The main prosecutors were Yazov, Kryuchkov, Shenin, and Varennikov.\n\nOn 23 February 1994, the [[State Duma]] issued an amnesty to the defense, and on 1 March 1994, the case was closed with all ten defendants accepting [[amnesty]]. Varennikov requested amnesty on the condition that Mikhail Gorbachev would be the next to be prosecuted, as he accused Gorbachev of creating the recent political disorder. The court rejected his petition, and upon Varennikov sending his request to the Prosecutor General's office, it was rejected again.\n\nTen days after the close, the Presidium of the Supreme Court revived the [[prosecution]], ruling that procedural infringements regarding the amnesty had occurred. The Presidium arranged a new hearing and assigned a new judge, Viktor Aleksandrovich Yaskin. He conducted the case review using revised court procedures. Yaskin offered the defendants amnesty, and all but Varennikov accepted it. Varennikov was acquitted on the argument that he was following the orders of [[Minister of Defence (Soviet Union)|Minister of Defense]].\n\nKryuchkov, Yazov, Shenin, and Pavlov were named as the main conspirators.\n\n==Further fate of GKChP members==\nPugo committed suicide, together with his wife. However, some sources speculate that he may have been murdered.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/stories/2001/08/17/019.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010905011525/http://www.themoscowtimes.com/stories/2001/08/17/019.html |archivedate=September 5, 2001 |title=The Men Who Tried to Topple Mikhail Gorbachev |publisher=The Moscow Times |date=August 17, 2001}}</ref>\n\nYazov spent 18 months in [[Matrosskaya Tishina]], a prison in northern [[Moscow]]. According to the magazine ''Vlast'' No. 41(85) of 14 October 1991, he contacted the President from jail with a recorded video message, in which he repented and called himself \"an old fool\". Yazov denies ever doing that, and he also accepted the amnesty offered by the Russians stating that he was not guilty. He was dismissed from military service by the Presidential Order, and at his discharge, was awarded a ceremonial weapon. He was also awarded an order of honor by the [[President of Russian Federation]]. Yazov later worked as a military adviser at the [[General Staff Academy (Russia)|General Staff Academy]]. He died in 2020 in Moscow, after a prolonged illness.\n\nVarennikov spent 18 months in Matrosskaya Tishina, refused to accept the offered amnesty, and was eventually found not guilty to the Russians. Prior to the formation of the Gang of Eight, Varennikov participated in the [[January Events (Lithuania)|January Events]], an attempt to capture the TV-station in [[Vilnius]], Lithuania. According to Gorbachev's aide, [[Anatoly Chernyaev]], Varennikov personally made the decision to use force against the Lithuanians, without discussion with the President.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ng.ru/ideas/2006-07-03/9_ussr.html |script-title=ru:\u0414\u0435\u043d\u044c\u0433\u0438 \u0438 \u0441\u0443\u0434\u044c\u0431\u0430 \u0438\u043c\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0438 |publisher=\u041d\u0435\u0437\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0441\u0438\u043c\u0430\u044f \u0433\u0430\u0437\u0435\u0442\u0430 |date=June 3, 2006|language=ru}}</ref> Varennikov was a people's deputy, starting in 1995 and until his death.

The Gang of Eight were [[hard-line]] members of the Communist Party ([[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|CPSU]]) who were opposed to Gorbachev's reform program and the [[Union of Sovereign States|new union treaty]] he had negotiated, which dispersed much of the central government's power to the republics. The coup collapsed after only two days, and although Gorbachev was restored as President, his authority was irreparably damaged and he became less influential outside of Moscow. The event destabilized the Soviet Union and many speculate that it played a role in both the demise of the CPSU and the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]]. After the coup failed, the seven living members of the Gang of Eight were arrested.\n\n==Court trials==\nOn December 15, 1992, over a year after the attempted coup, the Prosecutor General sent the criminal case against the Gang of Eight to the Military Collegiate of the [[Supreme Court of the Russian Federation]]. Anatoliy Ukolov, a deputy chairman of the Collegiate, was charged with reviewing the case, and the hearing was scheduled for 26 January 1993. The defendants included the aforementioned seven living members of the group plus [[Oleg Shenin]] (1937\u20132009), Politburo and secretariat member; [[Anatoly Lukyanov]] (b. 1930), Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union; and [[Valentin Varennikov]] (1923\u20132009), General of the Army, Deputy Minister of Defense, and Commander of Land Forces.\n\nThe trials lasted more than ten months, from 14 April 1993 until 1 March 1994. They were open to the public and press; however, foreign press did not participate due to lack of space in the courtroom. A prosecution commission was assigned to the case by the Collegiate, consisting of nine people and headed by Denisov, a Deputy Prosecutor General. The defense attorneys, Genri Reznik (Shenin), Genrikh Padva, Yuriy Ivanov (Kryuchkov), and Dmitriy Shteinberg (Varennikov) were hired, but in total, there were seventeen defense attorneys. After various delay tactics staged by the defense, the trial began on 30 November 1993. The main prosecutors were Yazov, Kryuchkov, Shenin, and Varennikov.\n\nOn 23 February 1994, the [[State Duma]] issued an amnesty to the defense, and on 1 March 1994, the case was closed with all ten defendants accepting [[amnesty]]. Varennikov requested amnesty on the condition that Mikhail Gorbachev would be the next to be prosecuted, as he accused Gorbachev of creating the recent political disorder. The court rejected his petition, and upon Varennikov sending his request to the Prosecutor General's office, it was rejected again.\n\nTen days after the close, the Presidium of the Supreme Court revived the [[prosecution]], ruling that procedural infringements regarding the amnesty had occurred. The Presidium arranged a new hearing and assigned a new judge, Viktor Aleksandrovich Yaskin. He conducted the case review using revised court procedures. Yaskin offered the defendants amnesty, and all but Varennikov accepted it. Varennikov was acquitted on the argument that he was following the orders of [[Minister of Defence (Soviet Union)|Minister of Defense]].\n\nKryuchkov, Yazov, Shenin, and Pavlov were named as the main conspirators.\n\n==Further fate of GKChP members==\nPugo committed suicide, together with his wife. However, some sources speculate that he may have been murdered.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/stories/2001/08/17/019.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010905011525/http://www.themoscowtimes.com/stories/2001/08/17/019.html |archivedate=September 5, 2001 |title=The Men Who Tried to Topple Mikhail Gorbachev |publisher=The Moscow Times |date=August 17, 2001}}</ref>\n\nYazov spent 18 months in [[Matrosskaya Tishina]], a prison in northern [[Moscow]]. According to the magazine \"Vlast\" No. 41(85) of 14 October 1991, he contacted the President from jail with a recorded video message, in which he repented and called himself \"an old fool\". Yazov denies ever doing that, and he also accepted the amnesty offered by the Russians stating that he was not guilty. He was dismissed from military service by the Presidential Order, and at his discharge, was awarded a ceremonial weapon. He was also awarded an order of honor by the [[President of Russian Federation]]. Yazov later worked as a military adviser at the [[General Staff Academy (Russia)|General Staff Academy]]. He died in 2020 in Moscow, after a prolonged illness.\n\nVarennikov spent 18 months in Matrosskaya Tishina, refused to accept the offered amnesty, and was eventually found not guilty to the Russians. Prior to the formation of the Gang of Eight, Varennikov participated in the [[January Events (Lithuania)|January Events]], an attempt to capture the TV-station in [[Vilnius]], Lithuania. According to Gorbachev's aide, [[Anatoly Chernyaev]], Varennikov personally made the decision to use force against the Lithuanians, without discussion with the President.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ng.ru/ideas/2006-07-03/9_ussr.html |script-title=ru:\u0414\u0435\u043d\u044c\u0433\u0438 \u0438 \u0441\u0443\u0434\u044c\u0431\u0430 \u0438\u043c\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0438 |publisher=\u041d\u0435\u0437\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0441\u0438\u043c\u0430\u044f \u0433\u0430\u0437\u0435\u0442\u0430 |date=June 3, 2006|language=ru}}</ref> Varennikov was a people's deputy, starting in 1995 and until his death.
