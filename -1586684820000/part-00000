Based on the [[Samaritan Pentateuch|Samaritan Torah]], Samaritans claim their worship is the true religion of the ancient Israelites prior to the [[Babylonian captivity|Babylonian exile]], preserved by those who remained in the [[Land of Israel]]. Their temple was built at [[Mount Gerizim]] in the middle of the 5th century BCE, and was destroyed under the [[Hasmonean dynasty|Hasmonean]] king [[John Hyrcanus]] of [[Judea]] in 110 BCE, although their descendants still worship among its ruins. The antagonism between Samaritans and Jews is important in understanding the Bible's [[New Testament]] stories of the \"[[Samaritan woman at the well]]\" and \"[[Parable of the Good Samaritan]]\". The modern Samaritans, however, see themselves as co-equals in inheritance to the Israelite lineage through Torah, as do the Jews, and are not antagonistic to Jews in modern times.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.israelite-samaritans.com/history/keepers-israelite-samaritan-identity/ |title=Keepers: Israelite Samaritan Identity Since Joshua bin Nun |publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Archevite]]s\n* [[Samaritan Revolts]]\n* [[List of burial places of biblical figures]]\n* [[Ahwat]]\n* [[Judea and Samaria Area]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite journal\n | last = Rainey\n | first = A.

Based on the [[Samaritan Pentateuch|Samaritan Torah]], Samaritans claim their worship is the true religion of the ancient Israelites prior to the [[Babylonian captivity|Babylonian exile]], preserved by those who remained in the [[Land of Israel]]. Their temple was built at [[Mount Gerizim]] in the middle of the 5th century BCE, and was destroyed under the [[Hasmonean dynasty|Hasmonean]] king [[John Hyrcanus]] of [[Judea]] in 110 BCE, although their descendants still worship among its ruins. The antagonism between Samaritans and Jews is important in understanding the Bible's [[New Testament]] stories of the \"[[Samaritan woman at the well]]\" and \"[[Parable of the Good Samaritan]]\". The modern Samaritans, however, see themselves as co-equals in inheritance to the Israelite lineage through Torah, as do the Jews, and are not antagonistic to Jews in modern times.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.israelite-samaritans.com/history/keepers-israelite-samaritan-identity/ |title=Keepers: Israelite Samaritan Identity Since Joshua bin Nun |publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Archevite]]s\n* [[Samaritan Revolts]]\n* [[List of burial places of biblical figures]]\n* [[Ahwat]]\n* [[Judea and Samaria Area]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite journal\n | last = Rainey\n | first = A.

Part of this is due to design in the world which is often right-hand biased. Handwriting is one of the biggest sources of actual disadvantage for left-handed people, other than for those forced to work with certain machinery. About 90 percent of the world's population is right-handed,<ref>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Hardyck C, Petrinovich LF |title=Left-handedness |journal=Psychol Bull |volume=84 |issue=3 |pages=385\u2013404 |year=1977 |pmid=859955|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.84.3.385}}</ref> so many common articles are designed for efficient use by right-handed people, and may be inconvenient, painful, or even dangerous for left-handed people to use.  These may include school desks, kitchen implements, and tools ranging from simple [[scissors]] to hazardous machinery such as [[Saw#Mechanically powered saws|power saws]].<ref name=\"tools\" /> \n\nBeyond being inherently disadvantaged by a right-handed bias in the design of tools, left-handed people have been subjected to deliberate discrimination and discouragement.  In certain societies, they may be considered unlucky or even malicious by the right-handed majority. Many languages still contain references to left-handedness to convey awkwardness, dishonesty, stupidity, or other undesirable qualities.  In many societies, left-handed people were historically (and in some cases still are) forced as children to use their right hands for tasks which they would naturally perform with the left, such as eating or writing.<ref name=\"Susumu\" />\n\n==Favorable perceptions==\n[[File:Inca lloque yupanqui.jpg|thumb|right|120px|[[Lloque Yupanqui]], the third [[Sapa Inca]], whose name means \"the glorified lefthander\"]]\nAmong [[Inca civilization|Incas]] left-handers were called (and now are called among the indigenous peoples of the [[Andes]]) ''lloq'e'' ({{lang-qu|lluq'i}}) which has positive value. Peoples of the Andes consider left-handers to possess special spiritual abilities, including [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] and [[healing]].\n\nThe Third [[Sapa Inca]]\u2014[[Lloque Yupanqui]]\u2014was left-handed. His name, when translated from [[Quechua languages|Quechua]], means \"the glorified lefthander.\"\n\nIn tantra [[Buddhism]], the left hand represents wisdom.<ref>{{cite book|last=Beer|first=Robert|title=The Encyclopedia of Tibetan Symbols and Motifs|year=2004|isbn=978-1-93247-610-1|page=150}}</ref>\n\nIn early Roman times, the left side retained a positive connotation, as the [[Augures]] proceeded from the eastern side.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etimo.it/?term=sinistro|title=Sinistro|language=Italian}}</ref> The negative meaning was subsequently borrowed into Latin from Greek, and ever since in all Roman languages.\n\nIn Russian, \"levsha\" (lefty, lefthander) became a common noun for skilled craftsman, after the title character from \"[[The Tale of Cross-eyed Lefty from Tula and the Steel Flea]]\" written in 1881 by [[Nikolai Leskov]].\n\n==Unfavorable perceptions==\nThe unfavorable associations and connotations of the use of the left hand among cultures are varied. In some areas, in order to preserve cleanliness where sanitation was an issue, the right hand, as the dominant hand of most individuals, was used for eating, handling food, and social interactions. The left hand would then be used for personal hygiene, specifically after urination and defecation. These rules were imposed on all, no matter their dominant hand. Through these practices, the left hand became known as the \"unclean\" hand.<ref name=\"Coren\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ROYoKoUn1jUC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA195|title=Left-handedness: behavioral implications and anomalies|first=Stanley|last=Coren|publisher=Elsevier Science Publishers B.V|year=1990|isbn=978-0-444-88438-1|location=Amsterdam}}</ref> Currently, amongst Muslims and in some societies including [[Nepal]] and India it is still customary to use the left hand for cleaning oneself with water after defecating.

For example, Jesus sits at God's right side. God's left hand, however, is the hand of [[Divine judgment|judgement]]. The [[Archangel Gabriel]] is sometimes called \"God's left hand\" and sits at God's left side. Those who fall from favor with God are sent to left, as described in Matthew 25: 32\u201333, in which sheep represent the righteous and goats represent the fallen: \"And he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats.

Some computer set-ups have the [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]] placed on the right side of the keyboard and unable to be repositioned to the left. The mouse itself is also sometimes shaped to fit the right hand better. The functions of mouse buttons, even on mice shaped to fit both hands, default to right-hand use. On two-button mice, the left button \u2014under the index finger of a right-handed person\u2014 is the primary button, while the right button performs secondary functions. The on-screen pointers themselves are also configured for right-handed people. Most desktop operating systems allow a user to reverse the functionality of mouse buttons to accommodate left-handed use, but left-handed cursors sometimes need to be specially downloaded.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/15833/make-your-mouse-pointers-left-hand-friendly/|title=Make Your Mouse Pointers Left-hand Friendly|publisher=How-To Geek|date=April 30, 2010|accessdate=January 7, 2011}}</ref> [[Trackball]]s and [[trackpad]]s are often shaped for right-handed use.

In first-person shooters, many games default to the right pointer-finger being used to fire, simulating a right-handed person pulling the trigger of the weapon.

Cameras predominantly have the hand grip, shutter release, film wind lever and commonly used selection buttons, switches and dials controlled by the right hand. Lens controls (where present) tend to be accessible by either hand. When an unskilled left-handed person uses a right-handed camera the hand control can be less steady and hence produce camera shake leading to poorer pictures at low shutter speeds.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\n===Musical instruments===\nLeft-handed adaptations have even bridged the world of music. Left-handed [[string instrument]]s are produced, including [[guitar]]s and [[violin]]s. Inverted [[trumpet]]s are made, too. Although the trumpet's valves are normally designed to be operated with the right hand, the prevailing belief is that left-handed trumpeters are not at a significant disadvantage. The [[French horn]], for example, is played with the left hand, yet most horn players are right-handed. Left handed [[drum]]mers also set up drum kits the exact opposite to conventional right-handed setup (i.e. [[Hi-hat (instrument)|hi-hat]] on the right, bass pedal under left foot, [[ride cymbal]] to the drummer's left, etc.).\n\n===Sports===\nA left-handed individual may be known as a southpaw, particularly in a sports context.

U.S., in Baseball).\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Definition for \"southpaw\"|publisher=Oxford English Dictionary Online}}</ref> A left-handed advantage in sports can be significant and even decisive, but this advantage usually results from a left-handed competitor's unshared familiarity with opposite-handed opponents. Baseball is an exception since batters, pitchers, and fielders in certain scenarios are physically advantaged or disadvantaged by their handedness. Some baseball players like [[Christian Yelich]] of the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] bat left-handed and throw right-handed.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Rosiak |first1=Todd |title=Right field: Christian Yelich's defensive versatility will be tested |url=https://www.jsonline.com/story/sports/mlb/brewers/2018/02/21/right-field-christian-yelichs-defensive-versatility-tested/356733002/ |website=Journal Sentinel |publisher=The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel |accessdate=October 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn baseball, due to the direction in which [[curveball]]s and [[Slider (baseball)|slider]]s break, it is generally accepted that the pitcher has an advantage when his handedness is the same as the batter's, and the batter has an advantage when they are opposite. For this reason, many baseball teams include a [[left-handed specialist]] pitcher, who is brought into the game specifically to pitch to dangerous left-handed batters in crucial situations. A left-handed first baseman uses a more fluid motion to tag out a baserunner returning to first base during a pickoff attempt by the pitcher and has less difficulty avoiding baserunners while presenting their mitt as a target for other fielders to throw to. It is very uncommon to see a left-handed player playing any infield position other than pitcher or first basemen due to the counterclockwise flow of the game when throwing the ball around the bases. A fielder's handedness is either a physical advantage or hindrance for similar reasons throughout the infield positions, and left-handedness is not always the more desirable dexterousness.\n\nLeft-handed [[Bowler (ten-pin)|bowlers]] are usually at an advantage during [[ten-pin bowling]] competition when hooking the ball into the pins from the left side of the lane. As there are fewer left-handed players, the lane's left side is not used as much, and thus the applied oil pattern does not change as quickly as it does for right-handed bowlers.\n\nIn [[boxing]], someone who boxes left-handed is frequently referred to as southpaw. The term is also used to refer to a stance in which the boxer places the right foot in front of the left, so it is possible for a right-handed boxer to box with a [[southpaw stance]]. Most boxers, southpaw or otherwise, tend to train with sparring partners who adopt an orthodox stance which gives southpaws an advantage, but some left-handed boxers such as [[Gerry Cooney]] and [[Oscar De La Hoya]] also used an orthodox stance, giving them other advantages. [[Manny Pacquiao]] is an example of a southpaw (although he writes with his right hand). In the popular boxing film series ''[[Rocky]]'', the main character [[Rocky Balboa]] is a southpaw. Southpaw is also a term in professional wrestling, often giving them the advantage.\nFencing weapons feature left- and right-handed grips, and a left-handed fencer's stance is opposite that of a right-handed opponent. Although commonly asserted that left-handed fencers have an advantage over right-handed opponents because the line of defence favors their sword arm, this assertion describes both fencers in a mixed-handed duel, so neither competitor has a unique physical advantage. Thus the left-hander's advantage in fencing stems mostly from a right-hander's unfamiliarity with a left-handed stance.\n\nThe game of golf is most commonly played right-handed, and left-handed players typically must provide their own special [[golf club (equipment)|golf club]]s.<ref name=\"Wilson\" /> The game can be played with both hands, provided the player has both left- and right-handed clubs, giving an advantage over one-handed players. Professional golfer [[Phil Mickelson]] plays left-handed though he is naturally right-handed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pgatour.com/players/r/?/00/18/10/media|title=Personal section of PGA Tour official media guide|publisher=PGA Tour|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629092928/http://www.pgatour.com/players/r/?%2F00%2F18%2F10%2Fmedia|archivedate=June 29, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn tennis, southpaws hold the racket in their left hand. Because of this, their grip of the handle is supposedly adjusted in a slightly different style from right-handed players. Some world champion left-handed tennis players include [[Jimmy Connors]], [[Guillermo Vilas]], [[John McEnroe]], [[Martina Navratilova]], [[Marcelo R\u00edos]], [[Goran Ivani\u0161evi\u0107]]  and [[Rafael Nadal]].\n\nWhen playing volleyball, left-handed players are at an advantage when placed on the right wing to spike. This is because the ball does not travel over their head in order for them to hit the ball, and is therefore easier for a lefty to hit the ball. However, the reverse is true for the left wing. Right handed players are at an advantage on the left wing because the ball does not pass over their head while they are jumping to hit, therefore making it easier to contact the ball.\n\nOften the [[playing card]]s have their [[Pip (counting)|pips]] printed only in the upper left corner assuming holding them with right hand.

A left-handed shooter must either purchase a left-handed or ambidextrous firearm (which are manufactured in smaller numbers and are generally more expensive and/or harder to obtain), shoot a right-handed gun left-handed (which presents certain difficulties, such as the controls being improperly located for the left hand or hot shell cases being ejected towards the shooter's body, especially the eyes or down the collar or right sleeve), or learn to shoot right-handed (which may be less comfortable or \"natural\"). A related issue is [[ocular dominance]], due to which left-handed people may wish to shoot right-handed, and vice versa. Ocular dominance plays more of a rule in shooting accuracy than does left versus right handiness. Therefore, ocular dominance will cause a preference on how a shooter chooses to hold a gun.\n\nSome modern firearms are ambidextrous (e.g. the [[FN P90]] and [[Heckler & Koch P7]]), or can be converted between right- and left-handed operation (e.g. the [[Heckler & Koch G36]] and [[Steyr AUG]]). [[Bullpup]] rifles are particularly problematic for left-handers unless they can be reconfigured, since empty shells would be ejected straight into the shooter's face and cheek potentially causing injury, or otherwise designed from the ground up for ambidextrous use, often by way of complex ejection systems as seen on the [[FN F2000]] and the [[Kel-Tec RFB]]. The British [[SA80|L85 Assault Rifle]] must be fired right-handed, placing left-handed soldiers at a disadvantage. In contrast, the [[Steyr AUG]] is of a modular design and the ejection port and extractor can be switched/replaced to suit the handedness of the soldier operating it. The [[M16 rifle|M-16]] and its variants have a fixed ejection port, but being a conventional (i.e. not bullpup) design the ejection port is forward of the operator and hence able to be fired either-handed. Circa 1985, with the introduction of the M16A2 version, a case deflector was incorporated adjacent to the ejector port to direct discarded shells in a more forward direction, making the rifle even more left hand operator friendly. The deflector is not always effective, however, as the ejected shell still stands a chance of hitting the left-handed shooter's cheek, especially in windy conditions.\n\n[[Lever action]] and [[pump action]] firearms present fewer difficulties for left-handers than [[bolt action]] weapons do. Many weapons with adjustable sights allow for left-handed use, but for a right eye dominant shooter it is necessary to adjust. In fact, most weapons adjust well enough that a weapon will not eject shells into a left-hander's eye.\n\n===Machinery===\n[[Power tools]], machinery and other potentially dangerous equipment is typically manufactured with the right-handed user in mind. Common problems faced by left-handed operators include the inability to keep materials steady, and difficulty reaching the on/off switch, especially in emergency situations.<ref name=\"tools\">{{cite web|url=http://www.greathomeimprovements.com/Mar07_niche_theme/power-tools/finding-power-tools-for-left-handed-people.php|title=Finding Power Tools for Left Handed People|publisher=Great Home Improvements|accessdate=January 14, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711123652/http://www.greathomeimprovements.com/Mar07_niche_theme/power-tools/finding-power-tools-for-left-handed-people.php|archivedate=July 11, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> [[Table saw]]s, whose blades protrude from the top of a table and pose the risk of losing fingers or hands, have their cutting area on the right side. This makes it difficult for a left-handed operator to guide the material being cut, as it must be pushed to the right side to align with the fence to avoid kickback. On [[bandsaw]]s, the blade teeth are on the left side of the blade, necessitating the material being cut to be pushed from the left side of the machine. However, at this angle, the casing of the machine containing the rest of the blade is on the operator's left side, making it extremely difficult to guide the wood with their left hand.\n\nHandheld [[circular saw]]s are made almost exclusively for right-handers, with the motor and grip on the right side. If held in the left hand, it is impossible for the operator to see what they are cutting.

The [[Latin language|Latin]] adjective ''sinister/sinistra/sinistrum'' originally meant \"left\" but took on meanings of \"evil\" or \"unlucky\" by the [[Classical Latin]] era, and this double meaning survives in [[Romance languages|European derivatives of Latin]], and in the English word \"sinister\". Alternatively, ''sinister'' comes from the Latin word ''sinus'' meaning \"pocket\": a traditional Roman [[toga]] had only one pocket, located on the left side. The right hand has historically been associated with skill: the Latin word for right-handed is ''dexter'', as in \"dexterity\", meaning manual skill. Even the word \"[[ambidexterity]]\" reflects the [[bias]]. Its intended meaning is \"skillful on both sides\". However, since it keeps the Latin root ''dexter'', which means \"right\", it ends up conveying the idea of being \"right-handed on both sides\". This bias is also apparent in the lesser-known [[antonym]] \"ambisinistrous\", which means \"left-handed [''i.e.'', clumsy] on both sides\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yourdictionary.com/wotd/wotd.pl?word=ambisinistrous|title=Ambisinistrous|publisher=YourDictionary.com|accessdate=November 28, 2003}}</ref> In more technical contexts, \"sinistral\" may be used in place of \"left-handed\" and \"sinistrality\" in place of \"left-handedness\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yourdictionary.com/wotd/wotd.pl?word=sinistral|title=Sinistral|publisher=YourDictionary.com|accessdate=June 2006}}</ref>  In both [[Ancient Greek religion|Ancient Greek]] and [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]], [[auspice]]s (usually the flight paths of birds, as observed by a bird-diviner, or ''[[augur]]'') were thought to be unfavorable if appearing on the diviner's left-hand side and favorable if on the right: an ancient custom mentioned in [[Homer]]'s [[Iliad]] and of apparently Middle Eastern origin (as attested in the [[Amarna correspondence]], in which a king of [[Alashiya]], i.e. [[Cyprus]], requests an eagle-diviner from the [[Pharaoh]] of Egypt).\n\nMeanings gradually developed from use of these terms in the ancient languages. In many modern European languages, including English, the word for the direction \"right\" also means \"correct\" or \"proper\", and also stands for authority and justice.\n\nIn Sanskrit, the word \"\u0935\u093e\u092e\" (waama)\nstands for both \"left\" and \"wicked.\"\n \nIn most [[Slavic language]]s the root ''prav'' (right) is used in words carrying meanings of correctness or justice. In colloquial Russian the word ''\u043b\u0435\u0432\u044b\u0439 (levy\u012d)'' \"left\" means unofficial, counterfeit, strange. In Polish, the word ''prawo'' means \"right\" as well as \"law\", ''prawy'' means: lawful; the word ''lewy'' means \"left\" (opposite of right), and colloquially \"illegal\" (opposite of legal). The Czech slang term ''lev\u00e1rna'' (roughly \"left business\") denotes a suspicious, shady scheme or trickery.\n\nIn French, ''droit(e)'' ([[cognate]] to English ''direct'') means both \"right\" and \"straight\", as well as \"law\" and the legal sense of \"right\", while ''gauche'' means \"left\" and is also a synonym of ''maladroit'', literally \"not right\", meaning \"clumsy\". Spanish, Italian, Portuguese and German have similar constructs. The Spanish term ''diestro'' and the Italian term ''destro'' mean both \"right-handed\" and \"skillful\". The contemporary Italian word ''sinistra'' has both meanings of sinister and left (the masculine adjective for sinister being ''sinistro''), and ''maldestro'' means \"clumsy\". The Spanish ''siniestra'' has both, too, although the \"left\" meaning is less common and is usually expressed by ''izquierda'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://etimologias.dechile.net/?izquierda|title=Etimolog\u00eda de izquierda|publisher=deChile.com|accessdate=June 2006|language=Spanish| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060619201838/http://etimologias.dechile.net/?izquierda| archivedate= June 19, 2006 | url-status= live}}</ref> a Basque word that made its way into Portuguese as well.

The word for \"left\" is ''tr\u00e1i'', which also mean \"wrong\", \"opposite\". For example, \"m\u1eb7c \u00e1o tr\u00e1i\" means \"wearing a shirt inside out\", or \"l\u00e0m tr\u00e1i \u00fd\" means going against someone's will.\n\nIn Romanian ''drept/dreapt\u0103'' (coming from Latin ''directus'') means both \"right\" and \"straight\".

In Swedish, ''v\u00e4nster'' means \"left\". The term ''v\u00e4nsterprassel'' means \"infidelity\", \"adultery\" and \"cheating\". From this term the verb ''v\u00e4nstra'' is derived.\n\nIn Hungarian, the word for right is ''jobb'', which also means \"better\". The word for left is ''bal'', which also means \"bad\". In Estonian, the word ''pahem'' stands for both \"left\" and \"worse\" and the word ''parem'' stands for both \"right\" and \"better\".\n\nIn Turkish, the word for right is ''sa\u011f'', which means \"alive\".

The Spanish expression \"''tener dos pies izquierdos''\", in English, the expression \"to have two left feet\", refers to clumsiness in the domains of football or dancing. A \"left-handed compliment\" is considered one that is unflattering or dismissive in meaning. The Polish expression \"''mie\u0107 dwie lewe r\u0119ce''\", Dutch \"''twee linkerhanden hebben''\", German \"''zwei linke H\u00e4nde haben''\", the Bulgarian expression \"''dve levi ratse''\", French \"''avoir deux mains gauches''\", Hungarian ''k\u00e9tbalkezes'' and Czech \"''M\u00edt ob\u011b ruce lev\u00e9''\" all mean \"to have two left hands\"\u2014that one is clumsy or is a very poor handyman; the English equivalent is \"to be all thumbs\". Moreover, the German idiom \"''mit dem linken Fu\u00df aufgestanden sein''\", the Spanish expression \"''levantarse con el pie izquierdo''\", the French expression \"''s'\u00eatre lev\u00e9 du pied gauche''\", the Polish expression \"''wsta\u0107 lew\u0105 nog\u0105''\" and the Hungarian expression \"''bal l\u00e1bbal kelt fel''\" (literally, to get up with the left foot) mean to have a bad day and do everything wrong or unsuccessfully, related to the English expression \"to get up on the wrong side of the bed\". The Welsh phrase \"''tu chwith allan''\" and the Polish expression \"''na lew\u0105 stron\u0119''\" (left side out) refers to an object being inside-out.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aber.ac.uk/~gpcwww/pdf/GPC0018-03.pdf |title=Geiriadur Prifysgol Cymru |page=1735 |accessdate=2008-07-28}}</ref> In Russian and Polish, the use of the term ''nalyevo'' (''na lewo'' in Polish) means \"on the left\", but can also connote taking bribes or \"sneaky\" behavior. ''Balszerencse'' (lit. \"left luck\") is Hungarian for \"bad luck\".\n\nThere are many [[colloquial]] terms used to refer to a left-handed person, e.g. \"southpaw\" (USA).  Some are just slang or jargon words, while other references may be offensive or demeaning, either in context or in origin. In some parts of the English-speaking world, \"cack-handed\" is slang for left-handed, and is also used to mean clumsy. The origin of this term is disputed, but some suggest it is derived from the Latin ''cacare'', in reference to the habit of performing [[Washing|ablutions]] with the left hand, leaving the right hand \"clean\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-cac1.htm|title=Cack-handed|publisher=world wide words}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/cack-handed|title=Definition of \"cack-handed\"|publisher=The Free Dictionary}}</ref>  However, other sources suggest that it is derived from the Old Norse word ''keikr'', meaning \"bent backwards\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cack%20handed|title=Cack-handed|publisher=Merriam Webster Dictionary}}</ref> Australians frequently use \"cacky-handed\".

The right-to-left nature of these languages prevents left-handers from running their hand on the ink as happens with left-to-right languages. Because writing when moving one's hand away from its side of the body can cause smudging if the outward side of the hand is allowed to drag across the writing, it is considered easier to write the [[Latin alphabet]] with the right hand than with the left. Furthermore, it is considered more difficult to write legible [[Chinese language|Chinese characters]] with the left hand than it is to write Latin letters, though difficulty is subjective and depends on the person in question.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/LivinginChina/243637.htm|title=A question of the left being right \u2013 and normal|work=China Daily|date=February 22, 2008|accessdate=2011-01-19| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110124025533/http://china.org.cn/english/LivinginChina/243637.htm| archivedate= January 24, 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nLeft-to-right alphabets can be written smudge-free and in proper \"forward slant\" with the left hand if the paper is turned 1/4 turn clockwise (90 degrees to the right), and the left hand is drawn toward the body on forward strokes, and left to right on upward strokes (as expressed in directionality of the text). It is also possible to do [[calligraphy]] in this posture with the left hand, but using right-handed pen nibs. Otherwise, left-handed pen nibs are required in order to get the thick-to-thin stroke shapes correct for most type faces, and the left-handed calligrapher is very likely to smudge the text. Left-handed pen nibs are not generally easy to find, and strokes may have to be done backwards from traditional right-handed calligraphic work rules to avoid nib jamming and splatter. Left-handed people have an advantage in learning 19th-century [[copperplate script|copperplate]] hands, which control line-width by pressure on the point.\n\n==Civic life==\n\n===Schooling===\nAs almost all students in [[Public school (government funded)|public school]]s are right-handed, most commonly used implements are designed for right-handers, from [[pencil sharpener]]s to scissors to [[school desk|desks]].

[[Multiple-choice]] tests tend to put the question on the left side of the page and the answers on the right side. If the answers must be filled in<!--not a mistake--> in a separate booklet, it can be awkward and uncomfortable for a left-handed student to line up the booklet with the answers.

Some computer set-ups have the [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]] placed on the right side of the keyboard and unable to be repositioned to the left. The mouse itself is also sometimes shaped to fit the right hand better. The functions of mouse buttons, even on mice shaped to fit both hands, default to right-hand use. On two-button mice, the left button \u2014under the index finger of a right-handed person\u2014 is the primary button, while the right button performs secondary functions. The on-screen pointers themselves are also configured for right-handed people. Most desktop operating systems allow a user to reverse the functionality of mouse buttons to accommodate left-handed use, but left-handed cursors sometimes need to be specially downloaded.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/15833/make-your-mouse-pointers-left-hand-friendly/|title=Make Your Mouse Pointers Left-hand Friendly|publisher=How-To Geek|date=April 30, 2010|accessdate=January 7, 2011}}</ref> [[Trackball]]s and [[trackpad]]s are often shaped for right-handed use.

In first-person shooters, many games default to the right pointer-finger being used to fire, simulating a right-handed person pulling the trigger of the weapon. Certain systems' layouts, such as Nintendo's Wii U and 3DS, have games in which right-handed stylus use is assumed and can cause difficulty for left-handed players.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/shigeru-miyamoto-hears-this-left-handed-gamers-pain-1592285438/ | title=Shigeru Miyamoto Hears this Left-Handed Gamer's Pain |publisher=Kotaku}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Trackman marble wheel.JPG|thumb|A right-handed trackball is difficult to use with the left hand.]]\n\n====Knives====\nWhile European-style [[kitchen knife|kitchen knives]] are usually symmetrical, [[Japanese kitchen knives]] have the cutting edge ground asymmetrically, having the cutting edge closer to the user's body{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} with ratios{{clarify|reason=The ratio between what?|date=February 2012}} ranging from 70\u201330 for the average chef's knife, to 90\u201310 for professional [[sushi]] chef knives; left-handed models are rare, and usually must be specially ordered or custom made.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/23/business/23pursuits.html|title=How to Succeed at Knife-Sharpening Without Losing a Thumb|work=New York Times|date=September 23, 2006|accessdate=September 23, 2006}}</ref>  On the other hand, the majority of \"flat ground\" general-purpose knives typically have the cutting edge on the right, as with a left-handed knife, for aesthetic reasons rather than practical.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\n====Cameras====\nOne of the few cameras ever produced for left-handers was the half-frame [[Yashica]] Samurai. Cameras predominantly have the hand grip, shutter release, film wind lever and commonly used selection buttons, switches and dials controlled by the right hand. Lens controls (where present) tend to be accessible by either hand. When an unskilled left-handed person uses a right-handed camera the hand control can be less steady and hence produce camera shake leading to poorer pictures at low shutter speeds.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\n===Musical instruments===\nLeft-handed adaptations have even bridged the world of music. Left-handed [[string instrument]]s are produced, including [[guitar]]s and [[violin]]s. Inverted [[trumpet]]s are made, too. Although the trumpet's valves are normally designed to be operated with the right hand, the prevailing belief is that left-handed trumpeters are not at a significant disadvantage. The [[French horn]], for example, is played with the left hand, yet most horn players are right-handed. Left handed [[drum]]mers also set up drum kits the exact opposite to conventional right-handed setup (i.e. [[Hi-hat (instrument)|hi-hat]] on the right, bass pedal under left foot, [[ride cymbal]] to the drummer's left, etc.).\n\n===Sports===\nA left-handed individual may be known as a southpaw, particularly in a sports context.

U.S., in Baseball).\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Definition for \"southpaw\"|publisher=Oxford English Dictionary Online}}</ref> A left-handed advantage in sports can be significant and even decisive, but this advantage usually results from a left-handed competitor's unshared familiarity with opposite-handed opponents. Baseball is an exception since batters, pitchers, and fielders in certain scenarios are physically advantaged or disadvantaged by their handedness. Some baseball players like [[Christian Yelich]] of the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] bat left-handed and throw right-handed.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Rosiak |first1=Todd |title=Right field: Christian Yelich's defensive versatility will be tested |url=https://www.jsonline.com/story/sports/mlb/brewers/2018/02/21/right-field-christian-yelichs-defensive-versatility-tested/356733002/ |website=Journal Sentinel |publisher=The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel |accessdate=October 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn baseball, due to the direction in which [[curveball]]s and [[Slider (baseball)|slider]]s break, it is generally accepted that the pitcher has an advantage when his handedness is the same as the batter's, and the batter has an advantage when they are opposite. For this reason, many baseball teams include a [[left-handed specialist]] pitcher, who is brought into the game specifically to pitch to dangerous left-handed batters in crucial situations. A left-handed first baseman uses a more fluid motion to tag out a baserunner returning to first base during a pickoff attempt by the pitcher and has less difficulty avoiding baserunners while presenting their mitt as a target for other fielders to throw to. It is very uncommon to see a left-handed player playing any infield position other than pitcher or first basemen due to the counterclockwise flow of the game when throwing the ball around the bases. A fielder's handedness is either a physical advantage or hindrance for similar reasons throughout the infield positions, and left-handedness is not always the more desirable dexterousness.\n\nLeft-handed [[Bowler (ten-pin)|bowlers]] are usually at an advantage during [[ten-pin bowling]] competition when hooking the ball into the pins from the left side of the lane. As there are fewer left-handed players, the lane's left side is not used as much, and thus the applied oil pattern does not change as quickly as it does for right-handed bowlers.\n\nIn [[boxing]], someone who boxes left-handed is frequently referred to as southpaw. The term is also used to refer to a stance in which the boxer places the right foot in front of the left, so it is possible for a right-handed boxer to box with a [[southpaw stance]]. Most boxers, southpaw or otherwise, tend to train with sparring partners who adopt an orthodox stance which gives southpaws an advantage, but some left-handed boxers such as [[Gerry Cooney]] and [[Oscar De La Hoya]] also used an orthodox stance, giving them other advantages. [[Manny Pacquiao]] is an example of a southpaw (although he writes with his right hand). In the popular boxing film series ''[[Rocky]]'', the main character [[Rocky Balboa]] is a southpaw. Southpaw is also a term in professional wrestling, often giving them the advantage.\nFencing weapons feature left- and right-handed grips, and a left-handed fencer's stance is opposite that of a right-handed opponent. Although commonly asserted that left-handed fencers have an advantage over right-handed opponents because the line of defence favors their sword arm, this assertion describes both fencers in a mixed-handed duel, so neither competitor has a unique physical advantage. Thus the left-hander's advantage in fencing stems mostly from a right-hander's unfamiliarity with a left-handed stance.\n\nThe game of golf is most commonly played right-handed, and left-handed players typically must provide their own special [[golf club (equipment)|golf club]]s.<ref name=\"Wilson\" /> The game can be played with both hands, provided the player has both left- and right-handed clubs, giving an advantage over one-handed players. Professional golfer [[Phil Mickelson]] plays left-handed though he is naturally right-handed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pgatour.com/players/r/?/00/18/10/media|title=Personal section of PGA Tour official media guide|publisher=PGA Tour|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629092928/http://www.pgatour.com/players/r/?%2F00%2F18%2F10%2Fmedia|archivedate=June 29, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn tennis, southpaws hold the racket in their left hand. Because of this, their grip of the handle is supposedly adjusted in a slightly different style from right-handed players. Some world champion left-handed tennis players include [[Jimmy Connors]], [[Guillermo Vilas]], [[John McEnroe]], [[Martina Navratilova]], [[Marcelo R\u00edos]], [[Goran Ivani\u0161evi\u0107]]  and [[Rafael Nadal]].\n\nWhen playing volleyball, left-handed players are at an advantage when placed on the right wing to spike. This is because the ball does not travel over their head in order for them to hit the ball, and is therefore easier for a lefty to hit the ball. However, the reverse is true for the left wing. Right handed players are at an advantage on the left wing because the ball does not pass over their head while they are jumping to hit, therefore making it easier to contact the ball.\n\nOften the [[playing card]]s have their [[Pip (counting)|pips]] printed only in the upper left corner assuming holding them with right hand. Such design may be uncomfortable for left-handed people who may prefer all four corners of the card to be used.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.leftyslefthanded.com/Lefty_s_Left_Handed_Playing_Cards_p/607414.htm|title=Lefty's \"Always right\" double deck of playing cards}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/craigertiger/sinister-deck-the-left-handed-card-deck-with-famou|title=Sinister Deck: The Left-Handed Card Deck With Famous Lefties}}</ref>\n\n===Weapons===\n[[File:US Navy 071019-N-6552M-190 SEAL trainees scan the room for possible threats as part of a SEAL qualification training exercise.jpg|thumb|right|A [[United States Navy SEALs|US Navy SEALs]] left-handed shooter]]\nThe vast majority of [[firearm]]s are designed for right-handed shooters, with the operating handle, magazine release, or safety mechanisms set up for manipulation by the right hand, and fired cartridge cases ejected to the right. Also, scopes and sights may be mounted in such a way as to require the shooter to place the rifle against the right shoulder. A left-handed shooter must either purchase a left-handed or ambidextrous firearm (which are manufactured in smaller numbers and are generally more expensive and/or harder to obtain), shoot a right-handed gun left-handed (which presents certain difficulties, such as the controls being improperly located for the left hand or hot shell cases being ejected towards the shooter's body, especially the eyes or down the collar or right sleeve), or learn to shoot right-handed (which may be less comfortable or \"natural\"). A related issue is [[ocular dominance]], due to which left-handed people may wish to shoot right-handed, and vice versa. Ocular dominance plays more of a rule in shooting accuracy than does left versus right handiness. Therefore, ocular dominance will cause a preference on how a shooter chooses to hold a gun.\n\nSome modern firearms are ambidextrous (e.g. the [[FN P90]] and [[Heckler & Koch P7]]), or can be converted between right- and left-handed operation (e.g. the [[Heckler & Koch G36]] and [[Steyr AUG]]). [[Bullpup]] rifles are particularly problematic for left-handers unless they can be reconfigured, since empty shells would be ejected straight into the shooter's face and cheek potentially causing injury, or otherwise designed from the ground up for ambidextrous use, often by way of complex ejection systems as seen on the [[FN F2000]] and the [[Kel-Tec RFB]]. The British [[SA80|L85 Assault Rifle]] must be fired right-handed, placing left-handed soldiers at a disadvantage. In contrast, the [[Steyr AUG]] is of a modular design and the ejection port and extractor can be switched/replaced to suit the handedness of the soldier operating it. The [[M16 rifle|M-16]] and its variants have a fixed ejection port, but being a conventional (i.e. not bullpup) design the ejection port is forward of the operator and hence able to be fired either-handed. Circa 1985, with the introduction of the M16A2 version, a case deflector was incorporated adjacent to the ejector port to direct discarded shells in a more forward direction, making the rifle even more left hand operator friendly. The deflector is not always effective, however, as the ejected shell still stands a chance of hitting the left-handed shooter's cheek, especially in windy conditions.\n\n[[Lever action]] and [[pump action]] firearms present fewer difficulties for left-handers than [[bolt action]] weapons do. Many weapons with adjustable sights allow for left-handed use, but for a right eye dominant shooter it is necessary to adjust. In fact, most weapons adjust well enough that a weapon will not eject shells into a left-hander's eye.\n\n===Machinery===\n[[Power tools]], machinery and other potentially dangerous equipment is typically manufactured with the right-handed user in mind. Common problems faced by left-handed operators include the inability to keep materials steady, and difficulty reaching the on/off switch, especially in emergency situations.<ref name=\"tools\">{{cite web|url=http://www.greathomeimprovements.com/Mar07_niche_theme/power-tools/finding-power-tools-for-left-handed-people.php|title=Finding Power Tools for Left Handed People|publisher=Great Home Improvements|accessdate=January 14, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711123652/http://www.greathomeimprovements.com/Mar07_niche_theme/power-tools/finding-power-tools-for-left-handed-people.php|archivedate=July 11, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> [[Table saw]]s, whose blades protrude from the top of a table and pose the risk of losing fingers or hands, have their cutting area on the right side. This makes it difficult for a left-handed operator to guide the material being cut, as it must be pushed to the right side to align with the fence to avoid kickback. On [[bandsaw]]s, the blade teeth are on the left side of the blade, necessitating the material being cut to be pushed from the left side of the machine. However, at this angle, the casing of the machine containing the rest of the blade is on the operator's left side, making it extremely difficult to guide the wood with their left hand.\n\nHandheld [[circular saw]]s are made almost exclusively for right-handers, with the motor and grip on the right side. If held in the left hand, it is impossible for the operator to see what they are cutting. Tool manufacturer [[Porter-Cable]] produces a left-handed circular saw that can be purchased relatively inexpensively.<ref name=\"tools\" />\n\n{{Gallery\n |height=150|width=150|lines=4\n|File:Rem700 action lefthand standard right.jpg|Left-handed [[Remington 700]] rifle action\u2014note that the bolt handle is not visible from this side\n|File:Sega circolare.jpg|A [[table saw]].

The [[Latin language|Latin]] adjective ''sinister/sinistra/sinistrum'' originally meant \"left\" but took on meanings of \"evil\" or \"unlucky\" by the [[Classical Latin]] era, and this double meaning survives in [[Romance languages|European derivatives of Latin]], and in the English word \"sinister\". Alternatively, ''sinister'' comes from the Latin word ''sinus'' meaning \"pocket\": a traditional Roman [[toga]] had only one pocket, located on the left side. The right hand has historically been associated with skill: the Latin word for right-handed is ''dexter'', as in \"dexterity\", meaning manual skill. Even the word \"[[ambidexterity]]\" reflects the [[bias]]. Its intended meaning is \"skillful on both sides\". However, since it keeps the Latin root ''dexter'', which means \"right\", it ends up conveying the idea of being \"right-handed on both sides\". This bias is also apparent in the lesser-known [[antonym]] \"ambisinistrous\", which means \"left-handed [''i.e.'', clumsy] on both sides\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yourdictionary.com/wotd/wotd.pl?word=ambisinistrous|title=Ambisinistrous|publisher=YourDictionary.com|accessdate=November 28, 2003}}</ref> In more technical contexts, \"sinistral\" may be used in place of \"left-handed\" and \"sinistrality\" in place of \"left-handedness\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yourdictionary.com/wotd/wotd.pl?word=sinistral|title=Sinistral|publisher=YourDictionary.com|accessdate=June 2006}}</ref>  In both [[Ancient Greek religion|Ancient Greek]] and [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]], [[auspice]]s (usually the flight paths of birds, as observed by a bird-diviner, or ''[[augur]]'') were thought to be unfavorable if appearing on the diviner's left-hand side and favorable if on the right: an ancient custom mentioned in [[Homer]]'s [[Iliad]] and of apparently Middle Eastern origin (as attested in the [[Amarna correspondence]], in which a king of [[Alashiya]], i.e. [[Cyprus]], requests an eagle-diviner from the [[Pharaoh]] of Egypt).\n\nMeanings gradually developed from use of these terms in the ancient languages. In many modern European languages, including English, the word for the direction \"right\" also means \"correct\" or \"proper\", and also stands for authority and justice.\n\nIn Sanskrit, the word \"\u0935\u093e\u092e\" (waama)\nstands for both \"left\" and \"wicked.\"\n \nIn most [[Slavic language]]s the root ''prav'' (right) is used in words carrying meanings of correctness or justice. In colloquial Russian the word ''\u043b\u0435\u0432\u044b\u0439 (levy\u012d)'' \"left\" means unofficial, counterfeit, strange. In Polish, the word ''prawo'' means \"right\" as well as \"law\", ''prawy'' means: lawful; the word ''lewy'' means \"left\" (opposite of right), and colloquially \"illegal\" (opposite of legal). The Czech slang term ''lev\u00e1rna'' (roughly \"left business\") denotes a suspicious, shady scheme or trickery.\n\nIn French, ''droit(e)'' ([[cognate]] to English ''direct'') means both \"right\" and \"straight\", as well as \"law\" and the legal sense of \"right\", while ''gauche'' means \"left\" and is also a synonym of ''maladroit'', literally \"not right\", meaning \"clumsy\". Spanish, Italian, Portuguese and German have similar constructs. The Spanish term ''diestro'' and the Italian term ''destro'' mean both \"right-handed\" and \"skillful\". The contemporary Italian word ''sinistra'' has both meanings of sinister and left (the masculine adjective for sinister being ''sinistro''), and ''maldestro'' means \"clumsy\". The Spanish ''siniestra'' has both, too, although the \"left\" meaning is less common and is usually expressed by ''izquierda'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://etimologias.dechile.net/?izquierda|title=Etimolog\u00eda de izquierda|publisher=deChile.com|accessdate=June 2006|language=Spanish| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060619201838/http://etimologias.dechile.net/?izquierda| archivedate= June 19, 2006 | url-status= live}}</ref> a Basque word that made its way into Portuguese as well.

The word for \"left\" is ''tr\u00e1i'', which also mean \"wrong\", \"opposite\". For example, \"m\u1eb7c \u00e1o tr\u00e1i\" means \"wearing a shirt inside out\", or \"l\u00e0m tr\u00e1i \u00fd\" means going against someone's will.\n\nIn Romanian ''drept/dreapt\u0103'' (coming from Latin ''directus'') means both \"right\" and \"straight\".

The term can be used to convey clumsiness.\n\nIn Finnish, the word ''oikea'' means both \"right\" (okay, correct) and \"right\" (the opposite of left).\n\nIn Swedish, ''att g\u00f6ra n\u00e5got med v\u00e4nsterhanden'' (literally \"to do something with your left hand\") means \"to do something badly\". In Swedish, ''v\u00e4nster'' means \"left\". The term ''v\u00e4nsterprassel'' means \"infidelity\", \"adultery\" and \"cheating\". From this term the verb ''v\u00e4nstra'' is derived.\n\nIn Hungarian, the word for right is ''jobb'', which also means \"better\". The word for left is ''bal'', which also means \"bad\". In Estonian, the word ''pahem'' stands for both \"left\" and \"worse\" and the word ''parem'' stands for both \"right\" and \"better\".\n\nIn Turkish, the word for right is ''sa\u011f'', which means \"alive\". The word for left is ''sol'', which means \"discolor\", \"die\", \"ill\".\n\nIn Chinese culture, the adjective \"left\" ([[Chinese character]]: {{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5de6}}}}, [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]: ''zu\u01d2'') sometimes means \"improper\" or \"out of accord\". For instance, the phrase \"left path\" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5de6|\u9053}}}}, ''zu\u01d2d\u00e0o'') stands for unorthodox or immoral means.\n\nIn Korean, the word for right is ''oreun'' (\uc624\ub978), to be compared to the word meaning morally proper, ''orheun'' (\uc633\uc740) which shares the same pronunciation.<ref>{{cite book|author=YBM, Korea|year=2002|title=Si-sa Elite Korean-English Dictionary|isbn=978-89-17-07460-4}}</ref>\n\nIn Hebrew, as well as in other ancient [[Semitic language|Semitic]] and [[Mesopotamian]] languages, the term \"left\" was a symbol of power or custody.<ref>{{cite book|first=Jeffries|last=Hamilton|title=Social Justice and Deuteronomy: the Case of Deuteronomy 15|location=Atlanta|publisher=Scholar's Press|year=1992|page=145|isbn=978-1-55540-748-3}}</ref> There were also examples of left-handed assassins in the Old Testament (Ehud killing the Moabite king). The left hand symbolized the power to shame society, and was used as a metaphor for misfortune, [[natural evil]], or punishment from the gods. This metaphor survived ancient culture and was integrated into mainstream Christianity by early Catholic [[theologians]], such as [[Ambrose of Milan]],<ref>{{cite book|title=Ambrose of Milan: political letters and speeches / translated with an introduction and notes by J.H.W.G.

The Spanish expression \"''tener dos pies izquierdos''\", in English, the expression \"to have two left feet\", refers to clumsiness in the domains of football or dancing. A \"left-handed compliment\" is considered one that is unflattering or dismissive in meaning. The Polish expression \"''mie\u0107 dwie lewe r\u0119ce''\", Dutch \"''twee linkerhanden hebben''\", German \"''zwei linke H\u00e4nde haben''\", the Bulgarian expression \"''dve levi ratse''\", French \"''avoir deux mains gauches''\", Hungarian ''k\u00e9tbalkezes'' and Czech \"''M\u00edt ob\u011b ruce lev\u00e9''\" all mean \"to have two left hands\"\u2014that one is clumsy or is a very poor handyman; the English equivalent is \"to be all thumbs\". Moreover, the German idiom \"''mit dem linken Fu\u00df aufgestanden sein''\", the Spanish expression \"''levantarse con el pie izquierdo''\", the French expression \"''s'\u00eatre lev\u00e9 du pied gauche''\", the Polish expression \"''wsta\u0107 lew\u0105 nog\u0105''\" and the Hungarian expression \"''bal l\u00e1bbal kelt fel''\" (literally, to get up with the left foot) mean to have a bad day and do everything wrong or unsuccessfully, related to the English expression \"to get up on the wrong side of the bed\". The Welsh phrase \"''tu chwith allan''\" and the Polish expression \"''na lew\u0105 stron\u0119''\" (left side out) refers to an object being inside-out.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aber.ac.uk/~gpcwww/pdf/GPC0018-03.pdf |title=Geiriadur Prifysgol Cymru |page=1735 |accessdate=2008-07-28}}</ref> In Russian and Polish, the use of the term ''nalyevo'' (''na lewo'' in Polish) means \"on the left\", but can also connote taking bribes or \"sneaky\" behavior. ''Balszerencse'' (lit. \"left luck\") is Hungarian for \"bad luck\".\n\nThere are many [[colloquial]] terms used to refer to a left-handed person, e.g. \"southpaw\" (USA).  Some are just slang or jargon words, while other references may be offensive or demeaning, either in context or in origin. In some parts of the English-speaking world, \"cack-handed\" is slang for left-handed, and is also used to mean clumsy. The origin of this term is disputed, but some suggest it is derived from the Latin ''cacare'', in reference to the habit of performing [[Washing|ablutions]] with the left hand, leaving the right hand \"clean\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-cac1.htm|title=Cack-handed|publisher=world wide words}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/cack-handed|title=Definition of \"cack-handed\"|publisher=The Free Dictionary}}</ref>  However, other sources suggest that it is derived from the Old Norse word ''keikr'', meaning \"bent backwards\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cack%20handed|title=Cack-handed|publisher=Merriam Webster Dictionary}}</ref> Australians frequently use \"cacky-handed\". A less common Australian slang word for a left-handed individual is the term ''Molly-Dooker'', whose origins cannot be determined with certainty.<ref>{{cite web|last=Quinion|first=Michael|year=2003|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-mol2.htm|publisher=World Wide Words|title=Mollydooker|accessdate=October 31, 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Handwriting===\nLeft-handed people who speak [[Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Urdu]], [[Hebrew]] or any other right-to-left script do not have the same difficulties with writing. The right-to-left nature of these languages prevents left-handers from running their hand on the ink as happens with left-to-right languages. Because writing when moving one's hand away from its side of the body can cause smudging if the outward side of the hand is allowed to drag across the writing, it is considered easier to write the [[Latin alphabet]] with the right hand than with the left. Furthermore, it is considered more difficult to write legible [[Chinese language|Chinese characters]] with the left hand than it is to write Latin letters, though difficulty is subjective and depends on the person in question.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/LivinginChina/243637.htm|title=A question of the left being right \u2013 and normal|work=China Daily|date=February 22, 2008|accessdate=2011-01-19| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110124025533/http://china.org.cn/english/LivinginChina/243637.htm| archivedate= January 24, 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nLeft-to-right alphabets can be written smudge-free and in proper \"forward slant\" with the left hand if the paper is turned 1/4 turn clockwise (90 degrees to the right), and the left hand is drawn toward the body on forward strokes, and left to right on upward strokes (as expressed in directionality of the text). It is also possible to do [[calligraphy]] in this posture with the left hand, but using right-handed pen nibs. Otherwise, left-handed pen nibs are required in order to get the thick-to-thin stroke shapes correct for most type faces, and the left-handed calligrapher is very likely to smudge the text. Left-handed pen nibs are not generally easy to find, and strokes may have to be done backwards from traditional right-handed calligraphic work rules to avoid nib jamming and splatter. Left-handed people have an advantage in learning 19th-century [[copperplate script|copperplate]] hands, which control line-width by pressure on the point.\n\n==Civic life==\n\n===Schooling===\nAs almost all students in [[Public school (government funded)|public school]]s are right-handed, most commonly used implements are designed for right-handers, from [[pencil sharpener]]s to scissors to [[school desk|desks]]. The consequences to left-handed students can vary from decreased academic performance or physical ailments to nothing at all.<ref name=\"flower\">{{cite web|url=http://blogcritics.org/culture/article/left-over-left-out-left-behind/|title=Left Over, Left Out, Left Behind: The Daily Discrimination against Left-Handed Students|first=Mei|last=Flower|publisher=blog critics|date=July 28, 2005|accessdate=January 6, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn many classrooms and [[lecture hall]]s, desks are designed so that the writing surface is attached to the chair instead of separate from it. In this design, the desk is attached on the right side, offering an armrest for right-handed people to use while writing. In some of these desks, the writing surface does not extend fully to the left, necessitating a left-handed user to turn their body in order to write properly, sometimes causing back, neck and shoulder problems.<ref name=\"flower\" /><ref name=\"gaucheschool\">{{cite web|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~primate/lspeak2.html#let'sfixit|title=Common school problems|publisher=gauche!

[[Multiple-choice]] tests tend to put the question on the left side of the page and the answers on the right side. If the answers must be filled in<!--not a mistake--> in a separate booklet, it can be awkward and uncomfortable for a left-handed student to line up the booklet with the answers. The time it takes to find a comfortable, convenient position cuts into test-taking time, resulting in rushed answers and unchecked work.<ref name=\"flower\" /><ref name=\"gaucheschool\" />\n\nIn [[Vietnam]], schools officially require students to write with their right hands, and some teachers of Grade 1 (when writing is taught) would implement that rule by deducting points from tests written by the left hand. The Civic Education textbook for grade 6 mentions a student thanking her old teacher for helping her write with her right hand, and stopping her from using her left hand to write.\n\n===Employment===\nIn research done on the relations of handedness and employment, researchers may start their experiments believing left-handers earn lower wages than their right-handed counterparts, due to effects like difficulty using right-handed tools.<ref name=\"slate\">{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2147842|title=Sinister and Rich: The evidence that lefties earn more|first=Joel|last=Waldfogel|publisher=Slate|date=August 16, 2006|accessdate=2010-01-19| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100112084036/http://www.slate.com/id/2147842| archivedate= January 12, 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=April 2013}} However, their findings are more complex.

A [[4-8-0]] design was chosen which was based in many respects on the {{Interlanguage link|SB 570|lt=Class 570|de|SB 570|WD=}} of the [[Austrian Southern Railway]], but which, at the same time, had numerous improvements. Between 1923 and 1928 40 locomotives of this new '''Class 113''' were taken into service with the BB\u00d6.\n\nThis class was very powerful and much liked by locomotive crews. It was employed on the most importance passenger train duties and in front of express and fast trains (''Eilz\u00fcge'') and fulfilled its role on main lines well until the end of the steam era, when its top speed of 85&nbsp;km/h was no longer considered enough. In 1939, the [[Deutsche Reichsbahn]] took these locomotives over as '''DRG Class 33 101\u2013140'''. In 1953 there were still 33 engines left in the \u00d6BB, their Reichsbahn numbers being retained.
