Styles attempted a Phenomenal Forearm, only for Reigns to spear him in mid-air to retain the title. After the match, [[Seth Rollins]] made a surprise return and attacked Reigns with a Pedigree.<ref name=\"ER16\"/><ref name=Net/><ref name=ObserverReport/> Rollins then lifted the title over Reigns to end the broadcast.\n\n== Reception ==\nCritics gave a mixed-to-positive reception to the show, generally praising firstly the Intercontinental Championship four-way and secondly the main event WWE World Heavyweight Championship match and its post-match happenings, but the rest of the show was not as well received. The high amount of punishment AJ Styles received during the main event was also highlighted.\n\nJames Caldwell of ''Pro Wrestling Torch'' said that it was \"unfortunate there were so many finisher kick-outs on this show, but that seems to be the trend these days\". Caldwell rated the four-way match the best of the show at 4.5 stars out of 5, commenting that \"strong build-up\" resulted in a \"strong title match\", with further positives including that the \"Owens-Zayn feud was enhanced, Cesaro's amazing in-ring skills were captured, and Miz's post-Mania resurgence continued\". The next-best rated match was the main event at 3.75 stars: a \"very physical, PPV main event-worthy battle continuing to build up Styles's strong first year in WWE. Reigns plays the part well of a PPV main-eventer when matched up with the right opponent, like Styles, but not someone like [[Sheamus]].\" Also, Styles took a \"crazy amount of punishment\" during the match. The rest of the matches of the event were less well received, being rated either 2.25 or 2.5 stars. Corbin's pre-show performance showed he had \"a lot of work to do to belong\" on the main roster; the Tornado tag match was rushed and \"disorganized\"; Rusev winning the U.S. Championship was a positive; the tag title match was mostly a \"basic TV-quality action\" except for a \"good nearfall for The Vaudevillains\"; while the Asylum match had a \"good\" finish, but was dragged down by \"an overly-gimmicky WWE cage match concept\" and the \"middle portion [being] a big struggle trying to follow the four-way\".<ref name=\"ER16\"/>\n\nJack de Menezes of ''[[The Independent]]'' praised the Intercontinental title match, the main event and Seth Rollins' return, but \"elsewhere there was little to shout about, with matches either ending too short or lacking the thrills that ended the night\". The review deemed the four-way as \"one of the matches of the year\" that highlighted the Miz as a \"crafty champion\" with \"all his underhand tactics\" en route to retaining the title, as well as the \"hatred that remains between Zayn and Owens\". The main event was deemed \"brilliant\" and an \"epic battle\", leading to the show ending with Rollins' \"long-awaited return\" as the crowd erupted into cheers - this was contrasted with Reigns' \"frosty reception\". The Asylum \"match slowed down too often whenever either man tried to get a new weapon\", with de Menezes hoping Jericho and Ambrose's \"drawn out rivalry\" ended at Extreme Rules. For the tag title match, the Vaudevillains \"put in their best performance to date since moving up to the main roster\". Finally, Rusev, Anderson and Gallows dominated their respective matches, while Baron Corbin provided \"a show of brute strength and craftiness\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=De Menezes|first1=Jack|title=WWE Extreme Rules results: Seth Rollins returns to attack Roman Reigns after he defeats AJ Styles to retain title|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/wwe-mma-wrestling/wwe-extreme-rules-results-seth-rollins-returns-to-attack-roman-reigns-after-he-defeats-aj-styles-to-a7042876.html|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=May 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[Dave Meltzer]] of the ''Wrestling Observer'' wrote that the Intercontinental title match \"tore down the house\" as a \"super match with tons of near falls and saves\", and \"Cesaro and Zayn in particular were great.\" The main event was \"another super match\", as \"Styles had a death wish taking some crazy and I mean crazy bumps including a high backdrop through a table where he landed on his tailbone\". Then, the \"crowd went totally nuts for [Rollins] as a babyface\" in the post-match segment. Kalisto-Rusev was \"good\", with WWE \"pushing like Kalisto was injured at the end, and was coming into the match injured\". The women's match was poorer than Payback's and meant to \"elevate Dana Brooke\", with Meltzer feeling that the long-term plan is \"putting Charlotte and Dana Brooke into a duo to eventually set them up as rivals\". The tag matches were both \"short\", the first match seeing the crowd support going to Anderson and Gallows instead of the Usos. The short matches led to a \"weird match\" that was \"just too long\" between Ambrose and Jericho. The Asylum match \"didn't have much heat for a long time\" and was \"hurt following such a great\" four-way. However, Ambrose and Jericho did \"pick it up at the end\", with Jericho \"selling [the thumbtacks] tremendously\" for the finish.<ref name=ObserverReport>{{cite web|last1=Meltzer|first1=Dave|authorlink1=Dave Meltzer|title=WWE Extreme Rules 2016 live results: Roman Reigns vs. AJ Styles Rematch|url=http://www.f4wonline.com/wwe-news/wwe-extreme-rules-2016-live-results-roman-reigns-vs-aj-styles-rematch-213146|work=Wrestling Observer|accessdate=May 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\nKenny Herzog of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' criticized Extreme Rules as most of its match \"outcomes were far from shocking\"; also, it had a \"dated\" title and for \"its namesake stipulation\" failed to \"really lord its influence over the card\". Herzog highlighted the Asylum match as a \"prop-comedy disaster\" that was \"unsurprisingly, utterly inane\", but it was \"Jericho, tacks and all, who rescued this clunker from meaninglessness by giving it his unquestioned all\". Meanwhile, Herzog could not understand \"WWE's insistence on shading Ambrose as more goofy than gritty\". Another disappointment was the women's match for having a \"bizarre, forced finish\", as Brooke's \"arbitrary shift in allegiances rings pretty hollow\". Herzog also hoped that Natalya would not fade into \"irrelevance after helping carry the post-WrestleMania malaise\". Meanwhile, the finish of the tag title match was \"a bit cockamamie, and the opening tornado-rules contest was ho-hum\". Herzog still found positives in the show: the four-way was \"perfect\" with a \"multitude of near-falls and clever finish\" while everyone gave their \"best\". Also, AJ Styles, \"more than any other latter-career migrant to Vince McMahon's big top, has expeditiously qualified himself as a main-eventer\", having displayed \"world-class\" skills in the ring and taken \"some Hall of Fame bumps\". Then, the \"rousing return\" at the end of the show resulted in \"the torch of Heavyweight was cannily passed from super-sub A.J. to present- and future-stud Seth Rollins\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Herzog|first1=Kenny|title=WWE 'Extreme Rules': Rollins-Mania Runs Wild in Newark|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/sports/news/wwe-extreme-rules-rollins-mania-runs-wild-in-newark-20160523|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=25 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Aftermath ==\nHaving returned from injury, Seth Rollins set his sights on regaining the WWE World Heavyweight Championship.

Styles attempted a Phenomenal Forearm, only for Reigns to spear him in mid-air to retain the title. After the match, [[Seth Rollins]] made a surprise return and attacked Reigns with a Pedigree.<ref name=\"ER16\"/><ref name=Net/><ref name=ObserverReport/> Rollins then lifted the title over Reigns to end the broadcast.\n\n== Reception ==\nCritics gave a mixed-to-positive reception to the show, generally praising firstly the Intercontinental Championship four-way and secondly the main event WWE World Heavyweight Championship match and its post-match happenings, but the rest of the show was not as well received. The high amount of punishment AJ Styles received during the main event was also highlighted.\n\nJames Caldwell of ''Pro Wrestling Torch'' said that it was \"unfortunate there were so many finisher kick-outs on this show, but that seems to be the trend these days\". Caldwell rated the four-way match the best of the show at 4.5 stars out of 5, commenting that \"strong build-up\" resulted in a \"strong title match\", with further positives including that the \"Owens-Zayn feud was enhanced, Cesaro's amazing in-ring skills were captured, and Miz's post-Mania resurgence continued\". The next-best rated match was the main event at 3.75 stars: a \"very physical, PPV main event-worthy battle continuing to build up Styles's strong first year in WWE. Reigns plays the part well of a PPV main-eventer when matched up with the right opponent, like Styles, but not someone like [[Sheamus]].\" Also, Styles took a \"crazy amount of punishment\" during the match. The rest of the matches of the event were less well received, being rated either 2.25 or 2.5 stars. Corbin's pre-show performance showed he had \"a lot of work to do to belong\" on the main roster; the Tornado tag match was rushed and \"disorganized\"; Rusev winning the U.S. Championship was a positive; the tag title match was mostly a \"basic TV-quality action\" except for a \"good nearfall for The Vaudevillains\"; while the Asylum match had a \"good\" finish, but was dragged down by \"an overly-gimmicky WWE cage match concept\" and the \"middle portion [being] a big struggle trying to follow the four-way\".<ref name=\"ER16\"/>\n\nJack de Menezes of ''[[The Independent]]'' praised the Intercontinental title match, the main event and Seth Rollins' return, but \"elsewhere there was little to shout about, with matches either ending too short or lacking the thrills that ended the night\". The review deemed the four-way as \"one of the matches of the year\" that highlighted the Miz as a \"crafty champion\" with \"all his underhand tactics\" en route to retaining the title, as well as the \"hatred that remains between Zayn and Owens\". The main event was deemed \"brilliant\" and an \"epic battle\", leading to the show ending with Rollins' \"long-awaited return\" as the crowd erupted into cheers - this was contrasted with Reigns' \"frosty reception\". The Asylum \"match slowed down too often whenever either man tried to get a new weapon\", with de Menezes hoping Jericho and Ambrose's \"drawn out rivalry\" ended at Extreme Rules. For the tag title match, the Vaudevillains \"put in their best performance to date since moving up to the main roster\". Finally, Rusev, Anderson and Gallows dominated their respective matches, while Baron Corbin provided \"a show of brute strength and craftiness\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=De Menezes|first1=Jack|title=WWE Extreme Rules results: Seth Rollins returns to attack Roman Reigns after he defeats AJ Styles to retain title|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/wwe-mma-wrestling/wwe-extreme-rules-results-seth-rollins-returns-to-attack-roman-reigns-after-he-defeats-aj-styles-to-a7042876.html|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=May 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[Dave Meltzer]] of the ''Wrestling Observer'' wrote that the Intercontinental title match \"tore down the house\" as a \"super match with tons of near falls and saves\", and \"Cesaro and Zayn in particular were great.\" The main event was \"another super match\", as \"Styles had a death wish taking some crazy and I mean crazy bumps including a high backdrop through a table where he landed on his tailbone\". Then, the \"crowd went totally nuts for [Rollins] as a babyface\" in the post-match segment. Kalisto-Rusev was \"good\", with WWE \"pushing like Kalisto was injured at the end, and was coming into the match injured\". The women's match was poorer than Payback's and meant to \"elevate Dana Brooke\", with Meltzer feeling that the long-term plan is \"putting Charlotte and Dana Brooke into a duo to eventually set them up as rivals\". The tag matches were both \"short\", the first match seeing the crowd support going to Anderson and Gallows instead of the Usos. The short matches led to a \"weird match\" that was \"just too long\" between Ambrose and Jericho. The Asylum match \"didn't have much heat for a long time\" and was \"hurt following such a great\" four-way. However, Ambrose and Jericho did \"pick it up at the end\", with Jericho \"selling [the thumbtacks] tremendously\" for the finish.<ref name=ObserverReport>{{cite web|last1=Meltzer|first1=Dave|authorlink1=Dave Meltzer|title=WWE Extreme Rules 2016 live results: Roman Reigns vs. AJ Styles Rematch|url=http://www.f4wonline.com/wwe-news/wwe-extreme-rules-2016-live-results-roman-reigns-vs-aj-styles-rematch-213146|work=Wrestling Observer|accessdate=May 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\nKenny Herzog of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' criticized Extreme Rules as most of its match \"outcomes were far from shocking\"; also, it had a \"dated\" title and for \"its namesake stipulation\" failed to \"really lord its influence over the card\". Herzog highlighted the Asylum match as a \"prop-comedy disaster\" that was \"unsurprisingly, utterly inane\", but it was \"Jericho, tacks and all, who rescued this clunker from meaninglessness by giving it his unquestioned all\". Meanwhile, Herzog could not understand \"WWE's insistence on shading Ambrose as more goofy than gritty\". Another disappointment was the women's match for having a \"bizarre, forced finish\", as Brooke's \"arbitrary shift in allegiances rings pretty hollow\". Herzog also hoped that Natalya would not fade into \"irrelevance after helping carry the post-WrestleMania malaise\". Meanwhile, the finish of the tag title match was \"a bit cockamamie, and the opening tornado-rules contest was ho-hum\". Herzog still found positives in the show: the four-way was \"perfect\" with a \"multitude of near-falls and clever finish\" while everyone gave their \"best\". Also, AJ Styles, \"more than any other latter-career migrant to Vince McMahon's big top, has expeditiously qualified himself as a main-eventer\", having displayed \"world-class\" skills in the ring and taken \"some Hall of Fame bumps\". Then, the \"rousing return\" at the end of the show resulted in \"the torch of Heavyweight was cannily passed from super-sub A.J. to present- and future-stud Seth Rollins\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Herzog|first1=Kenny|title=WWE 'Extreme Rules': Rollins-Mania Runs Wild in Newark|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/sports/news/wwe-extreme-rules-rollins-mania-runs-wild-in-newark-20160523|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=25 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Aftermath ==\nHaving returned from injury, Seth Rollins set his sights on regaining the WWE World Heavyweight Championship.

In 1984, Municipality of Postojna issued a decree declaring Lake ''Pal\u010dje'', Lake ''Petelinje'' and Minor & Major Lake ''Drskov\u010de'' natural monuments and a decade later it expanded to 13 lakes. Despite this, the army still used Lake ''Pal\u010dje'' and Lake ''Petelinje'', and other areas were becoming overgrown due to discontinuation of farming, so the area continued to degrade. Now, Lake ''Pal\u010dje'' and Lake ''Petelinje'' are protected as Natural Values of national significance, and other lakes as Natural Values of local significance. The lakes are also part of the Ecologically Important Area Sne\u017enik-Pivka, the [[Natura 2000|Special Protection Area]] Sne\u017enik-Pivka, and the Conditionally Special Protection Area Javorniki-Sne\u017enik.<ref name=\"Cernati\u010d2005\">{{cite journal |last1=Cernati\u010d Gregori\u010d |first1=Anica |last2=Gorki\u010d |first2=Mirjam |year=2005 |url=https://ojs.zrc-sazu.si/carsologica/article/view/308/297 |title=Intermittent lakes of the Upper Pivka - Protection in time |journal=Acta Carsologica |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=815-828}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, Seasonal lakes of Pivka regional park was established, encompassing all lakes in the Municipality of Pivka.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://radioprvi.rtvslo.si/2017/03/nedeljska-reportaza-61/ |title=Piv\u0161ka presihajo\u010da jezera \u2013 ogrlica 17 jezer |trans-title=Intermittent lakes of Pivka - a necklace of 17 lakes |language=sl |first=Jurij |last=Popov |date=2017-04-02 |work=[[RTV Slovenia|Radio Prvi]] |accessdate=2020-04-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite document |url=https://www.uradni-list.si/glasilo-uradni-list-rs/vsebina?urlurid=20141783 |title=Odlok o Krajinskem parku Piv\u0161ka presihajo\u010da jezera |work=Official Gazzette of the Republic of Slovenia |issue=43/2014 |date=2014-06-13 |pages=4666}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Seasonal lakes of Pivka}}\n[[Category:Lakes of Inner Carniola]]\n[[Category:Natural monuments of Slovenia|Lake]]\n[[Category:Wetlands in Inner Carniola]]\n[[Category:Municipality of Pivka]]\n[[Category:Municipality of Ilirska Bistrica]]\n[[Category:Municipality of Postojna]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = vertical\n | width     = 400\n | image1    = Palskopanorama3.jpg\n | alt1      = Full Lake Pal\u0161ko\n | image2    = Palskopanorama-autumn.jpg\n | alt2      = Empty area of Lake Pal\u0161ko\n | footer    = Lake Pal\u0161ko is the largest among the Seasonal lakes of Pivka.<br/>Top image: high water in December, after the autumn rains; bottom image: empty area in autumn, two months earlier.\n}}\n'''Seasonal lakes of Pivka''' is a group of 17 [[seasonal lake]]s, the most well known are Lake ''Petelinje'' and [[Lake Pal\u010dje|Lake ''Pal\u010dje'']], which is the biggest of them at about {{convert|1.9|km2|mi2}}.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://pivskajezera.si/pivska-jezera/opis|title=Piv\u0161ka presihajo\u010da jezera {{!}} Opis|website=pivskajezera.si|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref><ref name=\":4\">{{cite thesis |last=Vasilevska |first=Tanja |date=2007 |title=Kulturna krajina presihajo\u010dih Piv\u0161kih jezer kot bodo\u010di krajinski park |type=MSc |chapter= |publisher=[[University of Nova Gorica]] |url=http://www.ung.si/~library/diplome/OKOLJE/22Vasilevska.pdf |access-date=}}</ref> They are all located in [[Pivka Basin]], [[Inner Carniola]], [[Slovenia]].<ref name=\":0\" /> Lake ''Jeredovce'', the northernmost lake, is in [[Municipality of Postojna]], 10 of them (''Krajnikov dol,'' Lake ''Petelinje,'' Lake ''Radohovo,'' Lake ''Klenik,'' Lake ''Pal\u010dje,'' Lake ''Parje,'' Major & Minor Lake ''Drskov\u010de'' and Major & Minor Lake ''Zagorje'') are in [[Municipality of Pivka]] and the southernmost 6 (''Kljunov ribnik,'' Lake ''Kalec,'' Lake behind ''Kalec (Veliki dol),'' Lake ''Ba\u010d,'' Lake ''Lan'' and Lake ''\u0160embije'') are in [[Municipality of Ilirska Bistrica]], all of them are located at altitudes between {{convert|549|m|ft}} and {{convert|570|m|ft}}.<ref name=\":4\" /> There are also two areas (''[[polje]]'') that are only inundated during intense floods, so they are not officially considered Seasonal lakes of Pivka.\n\nThe lakes are situated on a rocky terrace in the [[Pivka Basin|Upper Pivka Basin]] at the foothills of the [[Javornik Hills|Javorniki]] range.

In 1984, Municipality of Postojna issued a decree declaring Lake ''Pal\u010dje'', Lake ''Petelinje'' and Minor & Major Lake ''Drskov\u010de'' natural monuments and a decade later it expanded to 13 lakes. Despite this, the army still used Lake ''Pal\u010dje'' and Lake ''Petelinje'', and other areas were becoming overgrown due to discontinuation of farming, so the area continued to degrade. Now, Lake ''Pal\u010dje'' and Lake ''Petelinje'' are protected as Natural Values of national significance, and other lakes as Natural Values of local significance. The lakes are also part of the Ecologically Important Area Sne\u017enik-Pivka, the [[Natura 2000|Special Protection Area]] Sne\u017enik-Pivka, and the Conditionally Special Protection Area Javorniki-Sne\u017enik.<ref name=\"Cernati\u010d2005\">{{cite journal |last1=Cernati\u010d Gregori\u010d |first1=Anica |last2=Gorki\u010d |first2=Mirjam |year=2005 |url=https://ojs.zrc-sazu.si/carsologica/article/view/308/297 |title=Intermittent lakes of the Upper Pivka - Protection in time |journal=Acta Carsologica |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=815-828}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, Seasonal lakes of Pivka regional park was established, encompassing all lakes in the Municipality of Pivka.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://radioprvi.rtvslo.si/2017/03/nedeljska-reportaza-61/ |title=Piv\u0161ka presihajo\u010da jezera \u2013 ogrlica 17 jezer |trans-title=Intermittent lakes of Pivka - a necklace of 17 lakes |language=sl |first=Jurij |last=Popov |date=2017-04-02 |work=[[RTV Slovenia|Radio Prvi]] |accessdate=2020-04-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite document |url=https://www.uradni-list.si/glasilo-uradni-list-rs/vsebina?urlurid=20141783 |title=Odlok o Krajinskem parku Piv\u0161ka presihajo\u010da jezera |work=Official Gazzette of the Republic of Slovenia |issue=43/2014 |date=2014-06-13 |pages=4666}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Seasonal lakes of Pivka}}\n[[Category:Lakes of Inner Carniola]]\n[[Category:Natural monuments of Slovenia|Lake]]\n[[Category:Wetlands in Inner Carniola]]\n[[Category:Municipality of Pivka]]\n[[Category:Municipality of Ilirska Bistrica]]\n[[Category:Municipality of Postojna]]\n", "name_user": "Yerpo", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eList of lakes:ce", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_lakes_of_Pivka"}

Evolutionary economics analyses the unleashing of a process of technological and institutional innovation by generating and testing a diversity of ideas which discover and accumulate more survival value for the costs incurred than competing alternatives. The evidence suggests that it could be [[Adaptive market hypothesis|adaptive efficiency]] that defines economic efficiency. [[Mainstream economics|Mainstream]] economic reasoning begins with the postulates of [[scarcity]] and [[rational agent]]s (that is, agents modeled as maximizing their individual welfare), with the \"[[rational choice]]\" for any agent being a straightforward  [[exercise (mathematics)|exercise]] in [[mathematical optimization]]. There has been renewed interest in treating economic systems as evolutionary systems in the developing field of [[Complexity economics]].{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nEvolutionary economics does not take the characteristics of either the objects of choice or of the decision-maker as fixed. Rather its focus is on the non-equilibrium ''processes'' that transform the economy ''from within'' and their implications.  The processes in turn emerge from actions of diverse agents with [[bounded rationality]] who may learn from experience and interactions and whose differences contribute to the change.  The subject draws more recently on [[evolutionary game theory]]<ref>Daniel Friedman (1998).  \"On Economic Applications of Evolutionary Game Theory,\" ''Journal of Evolutionary Economics'', 8(1), pp. [https://doi.org/10.1007%2Fs001910050054 15]-43.</ref> and on the [[evolution]]ary methodology of [[Charles Darwin]] and the [[non-equilibrium economics]] principle of circular and cumulative causation.

Inferior systems were beset by internal contradictions and [[Inefficiency|inefficiencies]] that make them impossible to survive over the long term. In Marx's scheme, [[feudalism]] was replaced by [[capitalism]], which would eventually be superseded by [[socialism]].<ref name=\"ComparingEconomicSystems\">''Gregory and Stuart''. (2005) ''Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First Century'', Seventh Edition, South-Western College Publishing, {{ISBN|0-618-26181-8}}</ref>\n\nAt approximately the same time, [[Charles Darwin]] developed a general framework for comprehending any process whereby small, [[random variation]]s could accumulate and predominate over time into large-scale changes that resulted in the emergence of wholly novel forms (\"[[speciation]]\").\n\nThis was followed shortly after by the work of the American pragmatic philosophers ([[Charles Sanders Peirce|Peirce]], [[William James|James]], [[John Dewey|Dewey]]) and the founding of two new disciplines, [[psychology]] and [[anthropology]], both of which were oriented toward cataloging and developing explanatory frameworks for the variety of [[behavior]] patterns (both individual and collective) that were becoming increasingly obvious to all systematic observers. The state of the world converged with the state of the evidence to make almost inevitable the development of a more \"modern\" framework for the analysis of substantive economic issues.\n\n=== Veblen (1898) ===\n\n[[Thorstein Veblen]] (1898) coined the term \"evolutionary economics\" in English. He began his career in the midst of this period of intellectual ferment, and as a young scholar came into direct contact with some of the leading figures of the various movements that were to shape the style and substance of [[social science]]s into the next century and beyond. Veblen saw the need for taking account of cultural variation in his approach; no universal \"human nature\" could possibly be invoked to explain the variety of norms and behaviors that the new science of anthropology showed to be the rule, rather than the exception. He emphasised the conflict between \"industrial\" and \"pecuniary\" or ceremonial values and this [[Veblenian dichotomy]] was interpreted in the hands of later writers as the \"ceremonial / instrumental dichotomy\" (Hodgson 2004);\n\nVeblen saw that every culture is materially based and dependent on tools and skills to support the \"life process\", while at the same time, every culture appeared to have a stratified structure of status (\"invidious distinctions\") that ran entirely contrary to the imperatives of the \"instrumental\" (read: \"technological\") aspects of group life. The \"ceremonial\" was related to the past, and conformed to and supported the tribal legends; \"instrumental\" was oriented toward the technological imperative to judge value by the ability to control future consequences. The \"Veblenian dichotomy\" was a specialized variant of the \"[[Instrumentalism|instrumental]] theory of value\" due to John Dewey, with whom Veblen was to make contact briefly at the [[University of Chicago]].\n\nArguably the most important works by Veblen include, but are not restricted to, his most famous works (''[[The Theory of the Leisure Class]]''; ''[[The Theory of Business Enterprise]]''), but his monograph ''Imperial Germany and the Industrial Revolution'' and the 1898 essay entitled ''Why is Economics not an Evolutionary Science'' have both been influential in shaping the research agenda for following generations of [[social scientist]]s. TOLC and TOBE together constitute an alternative construction on the neoclassical marginalist theories of consumption and production, respectively.\n\nBoth are founded on his dichotomy, which is at its core a valuational principle. The ceremonial patterns of activity are not bound to any past, but to one that generated a specific set of advantages and prejudices that underlie the current institutions. \"Instrumental\" judgments create benefits according to a new criterion, and therefore are inherently subversive. This line of analysis was more fully and explicitly developed by [[Clarence E. Ayres]] of the [[University of Texas at Austin]] from the 1920s.\n\nA seminal article by [[Armen Alchian]] (1950) argued for adaptive success of firms faced with uncertainty and incomplete information replacing [[profit maximization]] as an appropriate modeling assumption.<ref>Armen A. Alchian 1950, \"Uncertainty, Evolution and Economic Theory,\" ''Journal of Political Economy'', 58(3), pp. [http://econfaculty.gmu.edu/wew/syllabi/Econ811JournalArticles/AlchianJPE.pdf 211-21] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501230715/http://econfaculty.gmu.edu/wew/syllabi/Econ811JournalArticles/AlchianJPE.pdf |date=2015-05-01 }}.</ref> [[Kenneth Boulding]] was one of the advocates of the evolutionary methods in social science, as is evident from [[Kenneth Boulding's Evolutionary Perspective]]. [[Kenneth Arrow]], [[Ronald Coase]] and [[Douglass North]] are some of the [[Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel]] winners who are known for their sympathy to the field.\n\nMore narrowly the works [[Jack Downie]]<ref>Jack Downie (1958) The Competitive Process</ref> and [[Edith Penrose]]<ref>E. Penrose (1959) The Theory of the Growth of the Firm</ref> offer many insights for those thinking about evolution at the level of the firm in an industry.\n\n[[Joseph Schumpeter]], who lived in the first half of the 20th century, was the author of the book ''The Theory of Economic Development'' (1911, transl. 1934). It is important to note that for the word ''development'' he used in his native language, the German word \"Entwicklung\", which can be translated as development or evolution. The translators of the day used the word \"development\" from the French \"d\u00e9veloppement\", as opposed to \"evolution\" as this was used by Darwin. (Schumpeter, in his later writings in English as a professor at Harvard, used the word \"evolution\".)  The current term in common use is [[economic development]].\n\nIn Schumpeter's book he proposed an idea radical for its time: the evolutionary perspective. He based his theory on the assumption of usual [[Macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] [[Economic equilibrium|equilibrium]], which is something like \"the normal mode of economic affairs\". This equilibrium is being perpetually destroyed by [[entrepreneur]]s who try to introduce [[innovation]]s. A successful introduction of an innovation (i.e. a [[disruptive technology]]) disturbs the normal flow of economic life, because it forces some of the already existing technologies and means of production to lose their positions within the economy.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\n== Present state of discussion ==\nOne of the major contributions to the emerging field of evolutionary economics has been the publication of ''An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change'' by [[Richard R. Nelson (economist)|Richard Nelson]] and [[Sidney G. Winter]]. These authors have focused mostly on the issue of changes in [[technology]] and [[Business process|routines]], suggesting a framework for their analysis. If the change occurs constantly in the economy, then some kind of evolutionary process must be in action, and there has been a proposal that this process is [[Darwinism|Darwinian]] in nature.\n\nThen, mechanisms that provide [[Selection (biology)|selection]], generate [[Genetic variation|variation]] and establish [[self-replication]], must be identified. The authors introduced the term '[[steady change]]' to highlight the evolutionary aspect of economic processes and contrast it with the concept of '[[steady state]]' popular in [[classical economics]].<ref>[[Steady change]]</ref> Their approach can be compared and contrasted with the [[population ecology]] or [[organizational ecology]] approach in sociology: see Douma & Schreuder (2013, chapter 11). More recently, [[Richard R. Nelson|Nelson]], [[Giovanni Dosi|Dosi]], Pyka, Malerba, [[Sidney G. Winter|Winter]] and other scholars have been proposing an update of the state-of-art in evolutionary economics.<ref>{{cite book |author-link=Richard R.

In particular they establish that individuals and ethnic groups that descended from regions that are characterized by greater climatic volatility tend to be loss-neutral, whereas those originated in regions in which climatic conditions are more spatially correlated, tend to be more loss averse.\n\n=== Evolution of Risk Aversion ===\nOded Galor and Stelios Michalopoulos examine the coevolution of entrepreneurial spirit and the process of long-run economic development. Specifically, they argue that in the early stages of development, risk-tolerant entrepreneurial traits generated an evolutionary advantage, and the rise in the prevalence  of this trait amplified the pace of the growth process. However, in advanced stages of development, risk-aversion gained an evolutionary advantage, and contributed to convergence across countries.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Galor|first=Oded|last2=Michalopoulos|first2=Stelios|date=2012|title=Evolution and the growth process: Natural selection of entrepreneurial traits|url=|journal=Journal of Economic Theory|volume=147|issue=2|pages=759\u2013780|via=|doi=10.1016/j.jet.2011.04.005|pmc=4116112}}</ref>\n\n== Evolutionary psychology ==\n{{See also|Behavioral economics|Neuroeconomics}}\nA different approach is to apply [[evolutionary psychology]] principles to economics which is argued to explain problems such as inconsistencies and biases in [[rational choice theory]]. A basic economic concept such as [[utility]] may be better explained in terms of a set of biological preferences that maximized evolutionary [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] in the ancestral environment but not necessarily in the current one. In other words, the preferences for actions/decisions that promise \"utility\" (e.g. reaching for a piece of cake) were formed in the ancestral environment because of the adaptive advantages of such decisions (e.g. maximizing calorie intake). [[Loss aversion]] may be explained as being rational when living at subsistence level where a reduction of resources may have meant death and it thus may have been rational to place a greater value on losses than on gains.<ref name=\"AEP\"/>\n\nPeople are sometimes more cooperative and altruistic than predicted by economic theory which may be explained by mechanisms such as [[reciprocal altruism]] and [[group selection]] for cooperative behavior. An evolutionary approach may also explain differences between groups such as males being less risk-averse than females since males have more variable [[reproductive success]] than females. While unsuccessful risk-seeking may limit reproductive success for both sexes, males may potentially increase their reproductive success much more than females from successful risk-seeking. [[Frequency-dependent selection]] may explain why people differ in characteristics such as cooperative behavior with cheating becoming an increasingly less successful strategy as the numbers of cheaters increase.<ref name=\"AEP\"/>\n\nAnother argument is that humans have a poor intuitive grasp of the economics of the current environment which is very different from the ancestral environment. The ancestral environment likely had relatively little [[trade]], [[division of labor]], and [[capital good]]s. Technological change was very slow, wealth differences were much smaller, and possession of many available resources were likely [[zero-sum]] games where large inequalities were caused by various forms of exploitation. Humans therefore may have poor intuitive understanding the benefits of [[free trade]] (causing calls for [[protectionism]]), the value of capital goods (making the [[labor theory of value]] appealing), and may intuitively undervalue the benefits of technological development.<ref name=\"AEP\"/>\n\nThere may be a tendency to see the number of available jobs as a zero-sum game with the total number of jobs being fixed which causes people to not realize that [[minimum wage]] laws reduce the number of jobs or to believe that an increased number of jobs in other nations necessarily decreases the number of jobs in their own nation. Large [[income inequality]] may easily be viewed as due to exploitation rather than as due to individual differences in [[productivity]]. This may easily cause poor economic policies, especially since individual voters have few incentives to make the effort of studying societal economics instead of relying on their intuitions since an individual's vote counts for so little and since politicians may be reluctant to take a stand against intuitive views that are incorrect but widely held.<ref name=AEP/>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Business and economics}}\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}} \n* [[Behavioral economics]]\n* [[Complexity economics]]\n* [[Creative destruction]]\n* [[Cultural economics]]\n* [[EAEPE]]\n* [[Ecological model of competition]]\n* [[Scientific socialism|Evolutionary socialism]]\n* [[Hypergamy]]\n* [[Institutional economics]]\n* [[Population dynamics]]\n* [[Innovation system]]\n* [[Non-equilibrium economics]]\n* [[Universal Darwinism]]\n* [[Evolutionary and Institutional Economics Review]]\n* [[Giovanni Dosi]]\n* [[Robert H.

Evolutionary economics analyses the unleashing of a process of technological and institutional innovation by generating and testing a diversity of ideas which discover and accumulate more survival value for the costs incurred than competing alternatives. The evidence suggests that it could be [[Adaptive market hypothesis|adaptive efficiency]] that defines economic efficiency. [[Mainstream economics|Mainstream]] economic reasoning begins with the postulates of [[scarcity]] and [[rational agent]]s (that is, agents modeled as maximizing their individual welfare), with the \"[[rational choice]]\" for any agent being a straightforward  [[exercise (mathematics)|exercise]] in [[mathematical optimization]]. There has been renewed interest in treating economic systems as evolutionary systems in the developing field of [[Complexity economics]].{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nEvolutionary economics does not take the characteristics of either the objects of choice or of the decision-maker as fixed. Rather its focus is on the non-equilibrium ''processes'' that transform the economy ''from within'' and their implications.  The processes in turn emerge from actions of diverse agents with [[bounded rationality]] who may learn from experience and interactions and whose differences contribute to the change.  The subject draws more recently on [[evolutionary game theory]]<ref>Daniel Friedman (1998).  \"On Economic Applications of Evolutionary Game Theory,\" ''Journal of Evolutionary Economics'', 8(1), pp. [https://doi.org/10.1007%2Fs001910050054 15]-43.</ref> and on the [[evolution]]ary methodology of [[Charles Darwin]] and the [[non-equilibrium economics]] principle of circular and cumulative causation. It is [[Natural science|naturalistic]] in purging earlier notions of economic change as [[teleology|teleological]] or necessarily improving the human condition.<ref>Ulrich Witt (2008). \"evolutionary economics.\" ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'', 2nd Edition, v. 3,  pp. 67-68 [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_E000295&q=evolutinary%20economics&topicid=&result_number=1 Abstract.]</ref>\n\nA different approach is to apply [[evolutionary psychology]] principles to economics which is argued to explain problems such as inconsistencies and biases in [[rational choice theory]].

Inferior systems were beset by internal contradictions and [[Inefficiency|inefficiencies]] that make them impossible to survive over the long term. In Marx's scheme, [[feudalism]] was replaced by [[capitalism]], which would eventually be superseded by [[socialism]].<ref name=\"ComparingEconomicSystems\">''Gregory and Stuart''. (2005) ''Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First Century'', Seventh Edition, South-Western College Publishing, {{ISBN|0-618-26181-8}}</ref>\n\nAt approximately the same time, [[Charles Darwin]] developed a general framework for comprehending any process whereby small, [[random variation]]s could accumulate and predominate over time into large-scale changes that resulted in the emergence of wholly novel forms (\"[[speciation]]\").\n\nThis was followed shortly after by the work of the American pragmatic philosophers ([[Charles Sanders Peirce|Peirce]], [[William James|James]], [[John Dewey|Dewey]]) and the founding of two new disciplines, [[psychology]] and [[anthropology]], both of which were oriented toward cataloging and developing explanatory frameworks for the variety of [[behavior]] patterns (both individual and collective) that were becoming increasingly obvious to all systematic observers. The state of the world converged with the state of the evidence to make almost inevitable the development of a more \"modern\" framework for the analysis of substantive economic issues.\n\n=== Veblen (1898) ===\n\n[[Thorstein Veblen]] (1898) coined the term \"evolutionary economics\" in English. He began his career in the midst of this period of intellectual ferment, and as a young scholar came into direct contact with some of the leading figures of the various movements that were to shape the style and substance of [[social science]]s into the next century and beyond. Veblen saw the need for taking account of cultural variation in his approach; no universal \"human nature\" could possibly be invoked to explain the variety of norms and behaviors that the new science of anthropology showed to be the rule, rather than the exception. He emphasised the conflict between \"industrial\" and \"pecuniary\" or ceremonial values and this [[Veblenian dichotomy]] was interpreted in the hands of later writers as the \"ceremonial / instrumental dichotomy\" (Hodgson 2004);\n\nVeblen saw that every culture is materially based and dependent on tools and skills to support the \"life process\", while at the same time, every culture appeared to have a stratified structure of status (\"invidious distinctions\") that ran entirely contrary to the imperatives of the \"instrumental\" (read: \"technological\") aspects of group life. The \"ceremonial\" was related to the past, and conformed to and supported the tribal legends; \"instrumental\" was oriented toward the technological imperative to judge value by the ability to control future consequences. The \"Veblenian dichotomy\" was a specialized variant of the \"[[Instrumentalism|instrumental]] theory of value\" due to John Dewey, with whom Veblen was to make contact briefly at the [[University of Chicago]].\n\nArguably the most important works by Veblen include, but are not restricted to, his most famous works (''[[The Theory of the Leisure Class]]''; ''[[The Theory of Business Enterprise]]''), but his monograph ''Imperial Germany and the Industrial Revolution'' and the 1898 essay entitled ''Why is Economics not an Evolutionary Science'' have both been influential in shaping the research agenda for following generations of [[social scientist]]s. TOLC and TOBE together constitute an alternative construction on the neoclassical marginalist theories of consumption and production, respectively.\n\nBoth are founded on his dichotomy, which is at its core a valuational principle. The ceremonial patterns of activity are not bound to any past, but to one that generated a specific set of advantages and prejudices that underlie the current institutions. \"Instrumental\" judgments create benefits according to a new criterion, and therefore are inherently subversive. This line of analysis was more fully and explicitly developed by [[Clarence E. Ayres]] of the [[University of Texas at Austin]] from the 1920s.\n\nA seminal article by [[Armen Alchian]] (1950) argued for adaptive success of firms faced with uncertainty and incomplete information replacing [[profit maximization]] as an appropriate modeling assumption.<ref>Armen A. Alchian 1950, \"Uncertainty, Evolution and Economic Theory,\" ''Journal of Political Economy'', 58(3), pp. [http://econfaculty.gmu.edu/wew/syllabi/Econ811JournalArticles/AlchianJPE.pdf 211-21] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501230715/http://econfaculty.gmu.edu/wew/syllabi/Econ811JournalArticles/AlchianJPE.pdf |date=2015-05-01 }}.</ref> [[Kenneth Boulding]] was one of the advocates of the evolutionary methods in social science, as is evident from [[Kenneth Boulding's Evolutionary Perspective]]. [[Kenneth Arrow]], [[Ronald Coase]] and [[Douglass North]] are some of the [[Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel]] winners who are known for their sympathy to the field.\n\nMore narrowly the works [[Jack Downie]]<ref>Jack Downie (1958) The Competitive Process</ref> and [[Edith Penrose]]<ref>E. Penrose (1959) The Theory of the Growth of the Firm</ref> offer many insights for those thinking about evolution at the level of the firm in an industry.\n\n[[Joseph Schumpeter]], who lived in the first half of 20th century, was the author of the book ''The Theory of Economic Development'' (1911, transl. 1934). It is important to note that for the word ''development'' he used in his native language, the German word \"Entwicklung\", which can be translated as development or evolution. The translators of the day used the word \"development\" from the French \"d\u00e9veloppement\", as opposed to \"evolution\" as this was used by Darwin. (Schumpeter, in his later writings in English as a professor at Harvard, used the word \"evolution\".)  The current term in common use is [[economic development]].\n\nIn Schumpeter's book he proposed an idea radical for its time: the evolutionary perspective. He based his theory on the assumption of usual [[Macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] [[Economic equilibrium|equilibrium]], which is something like \"the normal mode of economic affairs\". This equilibrium is being perpetually destroyed by [[entrepreneur]]s who try to introduce [[innovation]]s. A successful introduction of an innovation (i.e. a [[disruptive technology]]) disturbs the normal flow of economic life, because it forces some of the already existing technologies and means of production to lose their positions within the economy.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\n== Present state of discussion ==\nOne of the major contributions to the emerging field of evolutionary economics has been the publication of ''An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change'' by [[Richard R. Nelson (economist)|Richard Nelson]] and [[Sidney G. Winter]]. These authors have focused mostly on the issue of changes in [[technology]] and [[Business process|routines]], suggesting a framework for their analysis. If the change occurs constantly in the economy, then some kind of evolutionary process must be in action, and there has been a proposal that this process is [[Darwinism|Darwinian]] in nature.\n\nThen, mechanisms that provide [[Selection (biology)|selection]], generate [[Genetic variation|variation]] and establish [[self-replication]], must be identified. The authors introduced the term '[[steady change]]' to highlight the evolutionary aspect of economic processes and contrast it with the concept of '[[steady state]]' popular in [[classical economics]].<ref>[[Steady change]]</ref> Their approach can be compared and contrasted with the [[population ecology]] or [[organizational ecology]] approach in sociology: see Douma & Schreuder (2013, chapter 11). More recently, [[Richard R. Nelson |Nelson]], [[Giovanni Dosi|Dosi]], Pyka, Malerba, [[Sidney G. Winter |Winter]] and other scholars have been proposing an update of the state-of-art in evolutionary economics<ref>{{cite book |author-link=Richard R.

They further establish the variations in these agricultural characteristics across the globe are associated with contemporary differences in economic and human behavior such as technological adoption, education, saving, and smoking.\n\n=== Evolution of Loss Aversion ===\nOded Galor and Viacheslav Savitskiy explore the evolutionary foundation of the phenomenon of [[loss aversion]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Galor|first=Oded|last2=Savitskiy|first2=Viacheslav|date=2018|title=Climate Roots of Loss Aversion|url=|journal=NBER Working Paper No. 25273, National Bureau of Economic Research|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> They theorize and confirm empirically that the evolution of loss aversion reflects an evolutionary process in which humans have gradually adapted the climatic shocks and their asymmetric effects on reproductive success in a period in which the available resource were very close to the subsistence consumption. In particular they establish that individuals and ethnic groups that descended from regions that are characterized by greater climatic volatility tend to be loss-neutral, whereas those originated in regions in which climatic conditions are more spatially correlated, tend to be more loss averse.\n\n=== Evolution of Risk Aversion ===\nOded Galor and Stelios Michalopoulos examine the coevolution of entrepreneurial spirit and the process of long-run economic development. Specifically, they argue that in the early stages of development, risk-tolerant entrepreneurial traits generated an evolutionary advantage, and the rise in the prevalence  of this trait amplified the pace of the growth process. However, in advanced stages of development, risk-aversion gained an evolutionary advantage, and contributed to convergence across countries.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Galor|first=Oded|last2=Michalopoulos|first2=Stelios|date=2012|title=Evolution and the growth process: Natural selection of entrepreneurial traits|url=|journal=Journal of Economic Theory|volume=147|issue=2|pages=759\u2013780|via=|doi=10.1016/j.jet.2011.04.005|pmc=4116112}}</ref>\n\n== Evolutionary psychology ==\n{{See also|Behavioral economics|Neuroeconomics}}\nA different approach is to apply [[evolutionary psychology]] principles to economics which is argued to explain problems such as inconsistencies and biases in [[rational choice theory]]. A basic economic concept such as [[utility]] may be better explained in terms of a set of biological preferences that maximized evolutionary [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] in the ancestral environment but not necessarily in the current one. In other words, the preferences for actions/decisions that promise \"utility\" (e.g. reaching for a piece of cake) were formed in the ancestral environment because of the adaptive advantages of such decisions (e.g. maximizing calorie intake). [[Loss aversion]] may be explained as being rational when living at subsistence level where a reduction of resources may have meant death and it thus may have been rational to place a greater value on losses than on gains.<ref name=\"AEP\"/>\n\nPeople are sometimes more cooperative and altruistic than predicted by economic theory which may be explained by mechanisms such as [[reciprocal altruism]] and [[group selection]] for cooperative behavior. An evolutionary approach may also explain differences between groups such as males being less risk-averse than females since males have more variable [[reproductive success]] than females. While unsuccessful risk-seeking may limit reproductive success for both sexes, males may potentially increase their reproductive success much more than females from successful risk-seeking. [[Frequency-dependent selection]] may explain why people differ in characteristics such as cooperative behavior with cheating becoming an increasingly less successful strategy as the numbers of cheaters increase.<ref name=\"AEP\"/>\n\nAnother argument is that humans have a poor intuitive grasp of the economics of the current environment which is very different from the ancestral environment. The ancestral environment likely had relatively little [[trade]], [[division of labor]], and [[capital good]]s. Technological change was very slow, wealth differences were much smaller, and possession of many available resources were likely [[zero-sum]] games where large inequalities were caused by various forms of exploitation. Humans therefore may have poor intuitive understanding the benefits of [[free trade]] (causing calls for [[protectionism]]), the value of capital goods (making the [[labor theory of value]] appealing), and may intuitively undervalue the benefits of technological development.<ref name=\"AEP\"/>\n\nThere may be a tendency to see the number of available jobs as a zero-sum game with the total number of jobs being fixed which causes people to not realize that [[minimum wage]] laws reduce the number of jobs or to believe that an increased number of jobs in other nations necessarily decreases the number of jobs in their own nation. Large [[income inequality]] may easily be viewed as due to exploitation rather than as due to individual differences in [[productivity]]. This may easily cause poor economic policies, especially since individual voters have few incentives to make the effort of studying societal economics instead of relying on their intuitions since an individual's vote counts for so little and since politicians may be reluctant to take a stand against intuitive views that are incorrect but widely held.<ref name=AEP/>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Business and economics}}\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}} \n* [[Behavioral economics]]\n* [[Complexity economics]]\n* [[Creative destruction]]\n* [[Cultural economics]]\n* [[EAEPE]]\n* [[Ecological model of competition]]\n* [[Scientific socialism|Evolutionary socialism]]\n* [[Hypergamy]]\n* [[Institutional economics]]\n* [[Population dynamics]]\n* [[Innovation system]]\n* [[Non-equilibrium economics]]\n* [[Universal Darwinism]]\n* [[Evolutionary and Institutional Economics Review]]\n* [[Giovanni Dosi]]\n* [[Robert H.
