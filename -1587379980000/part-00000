It is part of the parish of [[Dromcollogher-Broadford]] (previously known as Killagholehane). It is also very close to the boundary of north [[County Cork]].\n\nThere are many variations of 'Drom'. The locals spell it '''Dromcollogher''', but '''Drumcolloher''', '''Dromcolloher''', '''Drumcullogher''', and numerous other variations can be found. Dromcolliher is the version adopted by the Ordnance Survey, and postal authorities.\n\nSince 1962, the town has been home to the Irish Dresden pottery factory, which closed its doors in April 2009 but re-opened in June 2015.While it is controversial, it can be argued that Jamie Singelton, otherwise known as The Heineken Singelton Special, is from Dromcollogher.Other well known figures to hail from Dromcollogher are Ronan Cahill and of course the Notorious Eoin\u201dChode\u201dEnright.\n\n==History==\nIt was first mentioned in the 1160, in \"[[The Book of Leinster]]\".\nOther historical records include references in \"Westropp\" (1201), Munster Journal (1751), and the population was recorded as 658 in 1831.\n\nIt is classed a medieval town by [[Limerick County Council]] (Local Governing Body), and has a list of protected structures under the 'County Development Plan'. These include the facades of Aherne's and O'Kelly's, the local creamery, and courthouse, as well as two churches, Killagholehane and St. Timothys (now known as St. Bartholomews).\n\nThe modern church was built in 1824, by Fr. Micheal Fitzgerald, who purchased the land from a local landowner. It was restored several times, but was given a dramatic overhaul in the late 1980s/early 1990s by Healy and Partners Architects, Limerick.\n\nDromcollogher was one of the starting points for the Irish Co-Op Movement, with the first Co-Operative creamery being set up here in 1889 on the initiative of [[Horace Plunkett]]. The listed building has since been restored, and is now the National Dairy Cooperative Museum.  [[Percy French]], the renowned Irish Composer, once stayed here and composed the song \"There's Only One Street In Dromcollogher\".

It remained the worst known fire disaster in Irish history until the [[Whiddy Island Disaster|Betelgeuse incident]] in 1979 and the [[Stardust disaster]] in 1981, which claimed fifty and forty-eight lives respectively.\n\n== Sport ==\n[[Dromcollogher/Broadford GAA|Dromcollogher-Broadford]] won the 2015 [[Limerick Junior Hurling Championship]], beating Na Pairsaigh in the final. This was the club's second such championship win since Dromcollogher/Broadford joined forces, with the first being in 1993.  In 2008, Dromcollogher/Broadford GAA club won their first and only [[Munster Senior Club Football Championship]] competition, defeating Kilmurry-Ibrackane from Clare at the Gaelic Grounds. The only other team from Limerick to win the championship had been Thomond College in 1977.\n\nDromcollogher-Broadford Ladies football club was founded in 1999,{{fact|date=November 2017}} and won 2 All Ireland National Division 2 Titles in the Peil na n\u00d3g under 14 competition - in 2003 (Carlow) and in 2004 (Galway).{{fact|date=November 2017}} The club have also competed in Munster Junior club semi-finals on 3 occasions, and in 2016, competed in their first Munster club Junior Final, losing to Kinsale by 4 points.{{fact|date=November 2017}}\n\nHeinekingz XI\n\nIn mid 2020 amidst the coronavirus pandemic, locals Ronan Cahill and Jamie Singelton in assocation with Heineken assisted by some of their colleagues and of course Ginger Andy, formed Heinekingz XI, a pro club on fifa which would go on to reap many success\u2019s. The last known facts about the Heinekingz XI was that the club was trying to push for promtion after a sad relegation on their quest to reach Division 1. This quest continues to this day...\n\n== Festivals ==\nThe Dromcollogher Carnival is held each year in early July.

{"title_page": "International Accreditation Forum", "text_new": "{{Unreferenced|date=January 2019}}{{Short description|International organization providing accreditations}}The '''International Accreditation Forum, Inc. (IAF)''' is the world association of [[Conformance testing|Conformity Assessment]] [[Accreditation]] bodies and other bodies interested in conformity assessment in the fields of [[Management system|management systems]], [[Product (business)|products]], [[Service (business)|services]], [[Employment|personnel]] and other similar programs of conformity assessment. Its primary function is to develop a single worldwide program of conformity assessment which reduces [[Business risks|risk for business]] and its [[Customer|customers]] by assuring them that accredited [[wikt:certificate|certificate]]s may be relied upon.\n\nIAF members accredit certification or registration bodies that issue certificates attesting that an organization's management, products or personnel comply with a specified [[wikt:standard|standard]].\n\nAccreditation is an essential ingredient for competitiveness, access to new markets, productivity improvement, innovation of new products and environmental protection, as well as the health and safety of populations. An efficient and effective quality and standards infrastructure, underpinned by accreditation, is key to a country\u2019s growth, as well as being essential in creating a safer, cleaner, and more equitable and well-integrated world.\nAccreditation provides confidence in the quality, safety, and environmental credentials of goods, services, and processes. It is required for the effective operation of domestic markets, and its international recognition is important to enable access to foreign markets. Accreditation is a critical element in promoting and sustaining economic development as well as environmental and social well-being, as it provides confidence in metrology, standardization, and conformity assessment (which comprises testing, calibration, inspection, and certification).\n\nIAF has prepared an informative [http://www.compad.com.au/cms/iaf/workstation/upFiles/292851.IAF__Screen-ready_2009-02_Rev.pdf brochure] which provides general information about IAF, its activities, membership and programs.\n\n==Role of the IAF==\n\nThe primary purpose of IAF is two-fold. Firstly, to ensure that its accreditation body members only accredit bodies that are competent to do the work they undertake and are not subject to [[Conflict of interest|conflicts of interest]]. The second purpose of the IAF is to establish [[Mutual recognition agreement|mutual recognition arrangements]] (MRAs), known as [[Multilateral Recognition Arrangement]]s (MLAs), between its accreditation body members which reduces risk to business and its customers by ensuring that an accredited certificate may be relied upon anywhere in the world. The MLA contributes to the freedom of world trade by eliminating technical barriers to trade. IAF works to find the most effective way of achieving a single system that will allow companies with an accredited conformity assessment certificate in one part of the world, to have that certificate recognized else where in the world. The objective of the MLA is that it will cover all accreditation bodies in all [[Country|countries]] in the world, thus eliminating the need for [[Supply chain|suppliers]] of products or services to be certified in each country where they sell their products or services.\n\nAccording to [http://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/516141538488797114/Why-is-QI-important.pdf the World Bank], accreditation and the wider quality infrastructure, serve the needs of governments, businesses, and consumers. For governments, it provides a mechanism to support relevant trade and industrial policies and ensures enforcement of mandatory technical regulations. Further information can be found on [http://www.publicsectorassurance.org/ Public Sector Assurance]. For businesses, it helps limit the cost of production, by increasing productivity and enabling firms to be more competitive in domestic and foreign markets. More information can be found on [http://www.business-benefits.org/ Business Benefits]. For consumers, it ensures public health and safety as well as environmental and consumer protection. \nAccreditation is closely linked to the United Nations goals of promotion of sustainable development, to protection of human rights, and advancing economic prosperity. The work of ILAC and IAF is strongly aligned to key projects of [https://www.unido.org/sites/default/files/2016-10/SDG_ACCREDITATION_BROCHURE__2__0.pdf UNIDO] and [http://www.unece.org/trade/wp6/welcome.html UNECE], which promote the adoption of accreditation to facilitate trade, provide employment opportunities, and to facilitate exports and foreign direct investment.\nMaintaining strategic partnerships and technical cooperation, together with the use of standards and compliance related activities, forms an important part of UNIDO\u2019s approach. The relationship between UNIDO, the IAF and ILAC aims to enhance the impact of industrial development on economic growth and achieving the SDGs.\n\n==IAF CertSearch==\n\nIAF launched [https://www.iafcertsearch.org/ IAF CertSearch] so accredited certifications from around the world can be validated. IAF CertSearch is a global database where users can search and validate the status of accredited certification issued by a Certification Body which has been accredited by an IAF signatory member Accreditation Body.\nIAF CertSearch also provides organisations with information about the accredited network, which includes a list of all Accreditation Bodies and Certification Bodies across the globe.\n\u2022\tOrganisations seeking to become certified can browse a list of accredited Certification Bodies here.\n\u2022\tOrganisations seeking accreditation can browse a list of Accreditation Bodies here.\n\u2022\tOrganisations seeking to trade with a certified company can browse companies on the voluntary trade marketplace here. \n\n\n==Structure of the IAF==\n\nThe highest level of authority in IAF is the Members in a General Meeting. General Meetings make decisions and lay down [[policy]] in the name of the members. The Board is responsible for legal actions to be carried out on behalf of the members, for developing broad policy directions for IAF and for ensuring that the day-to-day work of the IAF is carried out in accordance with policies approved by members. The terms of reference, tasks and duties as defined by the Bylaws and the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) remain unchanged for the members at a General Meeting, the Board of Directors and the Secretary. The Executive Committee is responsible to the Board of Directors for the day-to-day work of IAF on the basis of decisions made by the Members and directions by the Board of Directors.

(IAF)''' is the world association of [[Conformance testing|Conformity Assessment]] [[Accreditation]] bodies and other bodies interested in conformity assessment in the fields of [[Management system|management systems]], [[Product (business)|products]], [[Service (business)|services]], [[Employment|personnel]] and other similar programs of conformity assessment. Its primary function is to develop a single worldwide program of conformity assessment which reduces [[Business risks|risk for business]] and its [[Customer|customers]] by assuring them that accredited [[wikt:certificate|certificate]]s may be relied upon.\n\nIAF members accredit certification or registration bodies that issue certificates attesting that an organization's management, products or personnel comply with a specified [[wikt:standard|standard]].\n\nAccreditation is an essential ingredient for competitiveness, access to new markets, productivity improvement, innovation of new products and environmental protection, as well as the health and safety of populations. An efficient and effective quality and standards infrastructure, underpinned by accreditation, is key to a country\u2019s growth, as well as being essential in creating a safer, cleaner, and more equitable and well-integrated world.\nAccreditation provides confidence in the quality, safety, and environmental credentials of goods, services, and processes. It is required for the effective operation of domestic markets, and its international recognition is important to enable access to foreign markets. Accreditation is a critical element in promoting and sustaining economic development as well as environmental and social well-being, as it provides confidence in metrology, standardization, and conformity assessment (which comprises testing, calibration, inspection, and certification).\n\nIAF has prepared an informative [http://www.compad.com.au/cms/iaf/workstation/upFiles/292851.IAF__Screen-ready_2009-02_Rev.pdf brochure] which provides general information about IAF, its activities, membership and programs.\n\n==Role of the IAF==\n\nThe primary purpose of IAF is two-fold. Firstly, to ensure that its accreditation body members only accredit bodies that are competent to do the work they undertake and are not subject to [[Conflict of interest|conflicts of interest]]. The second purpose of the IAF is to establish [[Mutual recognition agreement|mutual recognition arrangements]] (MRAs), known as [[Multilateral Recognition Arrangement]]s (MLAs), between its accreditation body members which reduces risk to business and its customers by ensuring that an accredited certificate may be relied upon anywhere in the world. The MLA contributes to the freedom of world trade by eliminating technical barriers to trade. IAF works to find the most effective way of achieving a single system that will allow companies with an accredited conformity assessment certificate in one part of the world, to have that certificate recognized else where in the world. The objective of the MLA is that it will cover all accreditation bodies in all [[Country|countries]] in the world, thus eliminating the need for [[Supply chain|suppliers]] of products or services to be certified in each country where they sell their products or services.\n\nAccording to [http://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/516141538488797114/Why-is-QI-important.pdf the World Bank], accreditation and the wider quality infrastructure, serve the needs of governments, businesses, and consumers. For governments, it provides a mechanism to support relevant trade and industrial policies and ensures enforcement of mandatory technical regulations. Further information can be found on [http://www.publicsectorassurance.org/ Public Sector Assurance]. For businesses, it helps limit the cost of production, by increasing productivity and enabling firms to be more competitive in domestic and foreign markets. More information can be found on [http://www.business-benefits.org/ Business Benefits]. For consumers, it ensures public health and safety as well as environmental and consumer protection. \nAccreditation is closely linked to the United Nations goals of promotion of sustainable development, to protection of human rights, and advancing economic prosperity. The work of ILAC and IAF is strongly aligned to key projects of [https://www.unido.org/sites/default/files/2016-10/SDG_ACCREDITATION_BROCHURE__2__0.pdf UNIDO] and [http://www.unece.org/trade/wp6/welcome.html UNECE], which promote the adoption of accreditation to facilitate trade, provide employment opportunities, and to facilitate exports and foreign direct investment.\nMaintaining strategic partnerships and technical cooperation, together with the use of standards and compliance related activities, forms an important part of UNIDO\u2019s approach. The relationship between UNIDO, the IAF and ILAC aims to enhance the impact of industrial development on economic growth and achieving the SDGs.\n\n==IAF CertSearch==\n\nIAF launched [https://www.iafcertsearch.org/ IAF CertSearch] so accredited certifications from around the world can be validated. IAF CertSearch is a global database where users can search and validate the status of accredited certification issued by a Certification Body which has been accredited by an IAF signatory member Accreditation Body.\nIAF CertSearch also provides organisations with information about the accredited network, which includes a list of all Accreditation Bodies and Certification Bodies across the globe.\n\u2022\tOrganisations seeking to become certified can browse a list of accredited Certification Bodies here.\n\u2022\tOrganisations seeking accreditation can browse a list of Accreditation Bodies here.\n\u2022\tOrganisations seeking to trade with a certified company can browse companies on the voluntary trade marketplace here. \n\n\n==Structure of the IAF==\n\nThe highest level of authority in IAF is the Members in a General Meeting. General Meetings make decisions and lay down [[policy]] in the name of the members. The Board is responsible for legal actions to be carried out on behalf of the members, for developing broad policy directions for IAF and for ensuring that the day-to-day work of the IAF is carried out in accordance with policies approved by members. The terms of reference, tasks and duties as defined by the Bylaws and the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) remain unchanged for the members at a General Meeting, the Board of Directors and the Secretary. The Executive Committee is responsible to the Board of Directors for the day-to-day work of IAF on the basis of decisions made by the Members and directions by the Board of Directors. The operations of all IAF Committees and Subordinate Groups, including the Executive Committee, are subject to the IAF General Procedures\n\n==Membership==\nThe International Accreditation Forum is a global association of Accreditation Bodies, Conformity Assessment Body associations, Regional Accreditation Groups, and Industry associations, including scheme owners. \n*  '''Accreditation Body Membership:''' Open to Bodies developing, or conducting and administering, accreditation of entities that perform conformity assessment such as management system certification, product certification, certification of persons, verification/validation, or similar conformity assessment.\n*  '''Association Membership:''' Open to groups of entities that engage in , are subject to, make use of, accept or rely on, conformity assessment results from bodies accredited by Accreditation Body Members of IAF.\n*  '''Regional Accreditation Group Membership:''' Open to regional groups of Accreditation Bodies whose aims include the maintenance of Regional Multilateral Recognition Arrangements recognising the equal reliability and/or equivalence of their members\u2019 accreditations.\nAn [https://www.iaf.nu/articles/IAF_Members_&_Signatories/4 official list] is available online.\n\n<gallery>\nIAF_1.jpg|Caption1\nIAF_2.jpg|Caption2\n</gallery>\n==World Accreditation Day==\nAccreditation, however, is not as widely known and understood, or used, as it should be.

As Ali's army returned from the [[Greek War of Independence]], his son and the commander of the army, [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]], suggested the creation of an Egyptian Cavalry Corps. The Corps was established in 1828 and a school was founded in [[Giza]] to train Cavalry officers.\nIn 1839, the Cavalry Corps had a total of 15 regiments scattered all over Egypt. The regiments and their respective locations included:\n\n* 1st Guards Cavalry Regiment (Latakia)\n* 2nd Guards Cavalry Regiment (Besan)\n* 1st Cavalry Regiment (Urfa)\n* 2nd Cavalry Regiment (Zanba)\n* 3rd Cavalry Regiment (Alexandria)\n* 4th Cavalry Regiment (Adana)\n* 5th Cavalry Regiment (Alexandria)\n* 6th Cavalry Regiment (Damascus)\n* 7th Cavalry Regiment (Tarsus)\n* 8th Cavalry Regiment (Damascus)\n* 9th Cavalry Regiment (Alexandria )\n* 10th Cavalry Regiment (Acre)\n* 11th Cavalry Regiment (Kilis)\n* 12th Cavalry Regiment (Tarsus)\n* 13th Cavalry Regiment (Urfa)\n\n=== The Cavalry School in Giza ===\nIn his book Clot Bey mentioned {{Which|date=April 2020}} that the formation of the cavalry teams in the Egyptian army were not formed according to the new system until after the army's return from the [[Greek War of Independence]], because, during this war, Ibrahim Pasha had witnessed the cavalry system of France and realised the importance of cavalry organisation. After his return to Egypt, he began to form cavalry teams based on the European system, and several European teachers were hired for this purpose.\n\nThe Military Academy of Cavalry was established in [[Giza]] at [[Mourad Bey Palace]], which was turned into a cavalry barracks. The school was organised by [[Monsieu Varane|Monsieur Varane]], who was from the officers of the Napoleonic Empire including Yawar, Marshal Gouvion Sancer, and his subordinate in-training officers, who were learning about cavalry manoeuvres and infantry movements.\n\nThe school used to follow the system of the [[Somme Military School]] in France, except for some minor modifications that were required by the local conditions.{{Clarify|reason=|date=April 2020}} Young Egyptians and Turks graduated as officers of the Cavalry Corps.\n\n[[Auguste de Marmont|Marshal Marmon]] visited this school in 1834, and there were 360 trainees in it, and he admired it and wrote about it on his journey:<blockquote>\"When I saw these students in the field carrying out manoeuvres, I imagined that I was in front of a line of the finest verses in our horses. While the school was lacking to reach a degree of perfection, some lessons in language, drawing, and so forth, but there is no dispute that it is from the side of organising the cavalry teams, it lacks nothing, The students are good at riding horses, the manoeuvres they perform take place with lightness, accuracy and wisdom, their system and their best regret, and their morale is fine, they are soldiers with all the meanings of the word, and the trumpet bearers perform their work with perfection. \"</blockquote>\n\n== Post Anglo-Egyptian War ==\nAfter the [[British Conquest of Egypt (1882)|Anglo-Egyptian war]], the Egyptian Military High Command was controlled by [[British Empire|British]] generals and was downsized until it became a homeland defence.\nThe Cavalry Corps was split into [[Battalion]]s instead of [[Regiment]]s. Their main engagement after the war was the long-running [[Mahdist War]]\n\n== World War I ==\nIn [[World War I|World War I,]] it was estimated that around one million Egyptians fought for the Entente on many different fronts including 100,000 of them on European Fronts (Greece, Italy, France and Belgium). Most of the Cavalry participation was on the [[North Africa]]n and Arabian fronts.\n\n== Modernisation ==\n{{Main|Egyptian Armored Corps}}\nA few years after World War I, Egypt ended the British Protectorate and a Kingdom under the rule of [[Fuad I of Egypt|Fuad I]] was established. Fuad's administration began to modernise everything in the country including the economy, military, education, etc. The military modernisation was focused on mechanisation, building new military schools and mobilising more men & reestablishing units. In 1928, the corps' name was changed to ''Royal Egyptian Cavalry Corps.'' The mechanisation process went totally on the Egyptian Cavalry Corps where many of its units (except the Royal Guards) replaced its traditional horse formations with Armoured Vehicles and Tanks that by the late 1930s all of the Corps was mechanised.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Military units and formations of Egypt]]\n[[Category:Cavalry units and formations]]\n", "name_user": "Shivaraj Vanamane", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(hdhd)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_Cavalry_Corps"}
