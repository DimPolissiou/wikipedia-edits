After the [[Sortition|casting of lots]] he was not chosen, the lot instead favoring [[Saint Matthias|Matthias]] to be numbered with the remaining eleven apostles.\n\n:<sup>21</sup>Wherefore of these men who have companied with us, all the time that the Lord Jesus came in and went out among us,\n:<sup>22</sup>Beginning from the baptism of John, until the day wherein he was taken up from us, one of these must be made a witness with us of his resurrection.\n:<sup>23</sup>And they appointed two, Joseph, called Barsabas, who wa s surnamed Justus, and Matthias.\n:<sup>24</sup>And praying, they said: Thou, Lord, who knowest the heart of all men, shew whether of these two thou hast chosen,\n:<sup>25</sup>To take the place of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas hath by transgression fallen, that he might go to his own place.\n:<sup>26</sup>And they gave them lot, and the lot fell upon Matthias, and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.\n:&mdash;Acts 1:21\u201326 [[Douay-Rheims Bible|D-R]]\n\nBoth Joseph and Matthias had been followers of Jesus from the beginning of Jesus' public ministry after the baptism he received from [[John the Baptist|John]]. He had continued as a member of the larger company of disciples even to the time that Jesus was [[Ascension of Jesus|taken up]] from them.\n\nFurther identification of Joseph is uncertain. In Christian tradition he is numbered among the [[Seventy disciples]] mentioned in {{bibleref2|Luke|10:1\u201324|9}}, although the biblical text mentions no names. \"After these things the Lord appointed other seventy also, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, whither he himself would come.\" (10:1)\n\nTheologian [[Robert Eisenman]] has read the shadowy figure of \"Joseph Justus\" as either a not-so-subtle cover for James ''the Just'', or a cloned conflation who represents in a single figure all the [[Brothers of Jesus|Desposyni (Brothers of Jesus)]] &mdash;rejected, according to the author of ''Acts'' in favor of the otherwise-unknown [[Saint Matthias|Matthias]].<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=http://www.depts.drew.edu/jhc/RPeisenman.html|title=Robert Eisenman's \"James the Brother of Jesus\": A Higher-Critical Review|website=www.depts.drew.edu}}</ref> ''Barnes\u2019 Notes on the Bible'' says that he was \u201csurnamed Justus\u201d or who \u201cwas called Justus\u201d: \u201cThis is a Latin name, meaning just, and was probably given him on account of his distinguished integrity.\u201d{{cn|date=November 2019}} The Anglican Bible scholar J.B.
