It was one of Maspero's most illustrious predecessors, Emmanuel de Roug\u00e9, who proposed that the names reflected the lands of the northern Mediterranean: the Lukka, Ekwesh, Tursha, Shekelesh, and Shardana were men from Lydia, Achaea, Tyrsenia (western Italy), Sicily, and Sardinia.\" De Roug\u00e9 and others regarded Meryre's auxiliaries-these \"peoples de la mer M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e\"- as mercenary bands, since the Sardinians, at least, were known to have served as mercenaries already in the early years of Ramesses the Great. Thus the only \"migration\" that the Karnak Inscription seemed to suggest was an attempted encroachment by Libyans upon neighboring territory.\"</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Turvashas]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* [[Robert Drews]], ''The End of the Bronze Age: Changes in Warfare and the Catastrophe ca. 1200 B.C.'', Princeton University Press, 1995. \n\n{{Etruscans}}\n\n[[Category:Pre-Indo-Europeans]]\n[[Category:Etruscans]]\n[[Category:Tribes in Greco-Roman historiography]]\n[[Category:Villanovan culture]]\n", "name_user": "2dk", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrrhenians"}
