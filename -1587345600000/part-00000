The story goes that travelers from [[Morgantown, West Virginia]], who made it to the borough by 4:00 P.M. had a \"fair chance\" of making it to [[Uniontown, Pennsylvania|Uniontown]] before sundown. Another explanation cited in the book ''Fairchance Through the Years'', compiled by the Fairchance Centennial History Committee, is that Fidelio H.

[[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race were 0.51% of the population.\n\nThere were 871 households, out of which 29.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 50.7% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 13.0% had a female householder with no husband present, and 31.7% were non-families. 27.3% of all households were made up of individuals, and 14.4% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.

The story goes that travelers from [[Morgantown, West Virginia]], who made it to the borough by 4:00 P.M. had a \"fair chance\" of making it to [[Uniontown, Pennsylvania|Uniontown]] before sundown. Another explanation cited in the book ''Fairchance Through the Years'', compiled by the Fairchance Centennial History Committee, is that Fidelio H. Oliphant, who operated iron furnaces in the area, went to a bank in Uniontown to borrow money with the assurance that he had a \"fair chance\" of paying it back.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Pittsburgh Metro Area}}\n{{Fayette County, Pennsylvania}}\n\n[[Category:Populated places established in 1889]]\n[[Category:Pittsburgh metropolitan area]]\n[[Category:Boroughs in Fayette County, Pennsylvania]]\n[[Category:1889 establishments in Pennsylvania]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReferences:add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairchance,_Pennsylvania"}

The new colonists turned the region, part of the [[New Barbadoes Township, New Jersey|New Barbadoes Township]], into five large farm lots, conjoined by two main roads - Paramus and Saddle River - and named it \"slooterdam\" (after a V-shaped [[sluice]]-like fishing [[weir]] built in the Passaic River by the Lenni Lenape).  The name stuck until 1791.  In the 1800s, these five lots became nine smaller lots, and three new roads - Fair Lawn Avenue, Lincoln Avenue, and Prospect Street - were constructed to encourage mobility between them.  Eighty houses were built by 1861, and the renamed Small Lots, now a part of the Saddle River Township and home to multiple vegetable and fruit farms and dairies, became an agricultural community.  Berdan Avenue, a new road located near five Berdan family farms, was soon added and Victorian homes were built alongside it and in nearby areas.  The grandest of the estates, perched atop a hill by Small Lots Road was David Acker's estate \"Fairlawn,\" from which the township gets its name (Images of America, Page 7).\n\nRapid suburban development of the town occurred in three sections: the River Road-Fair Lawn Avenue area known as \"Memorial Park\", the area at Lincoln Avenue and Wagaraw Road known as \"Columbus Heights\", and the area east of the railroad and south of Broadway, known as Warren Point. The development of this section was catalyzed by the \"establishment of a post office, a railroad station, and a trolley to the Hudson River\" (Images of America, Page 8).\n\nIn the 1900s, Fair Lawn residents were displeased about the schooling situation as part of Saddle River Township; the schools were either dilapidated or too far away for Fair Lawn residents, and citizens felt that they were not getting schools comparable to the tax money they were paying. As such, a movement to separate from Saddle River Township was born. Fair Lawn residents petitioned to the state, asking to incorporate as an independent borough, and in April 1924, the borough of Fair Lawn was voted into existence.\n\nFair Lawn is home to the following eight sites listed on the National Register of Historic Places:<ref>[http://www.nj.gov/dep/hpo/1identify/nrsr_lists/Bergen.pdf New Jersey and National Registers of Historic Places - Bergen County], [[New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection]] Historic Preservation Office, last updated November 20, 2017.

Accessed May 21, 2015.</ref>\n\n*'''Berdan Grove''', a residential neighborhood of single-family homes behind Thomas Jefferson Middle School, surrounding Berdan Grove Park on Berdan Avenue. This neighborhood is home to the borough's highest concentration of [[Asian American]]s and includes Milnes Elementary School.\n*'''Broadway District''' contains the major commercial thoroughfare of Broadway and houses the Broadway District commuter stop for NJ Transit's Bergen County Line train. Roughly located around the Warren Point and Lyncrest areas, the district also extends as far as Morlot Avenue along the tracks, roughly around or a little after Glen Rock Lumber, housing many industries on Banta Place. The Broadway District is mainly a shopping district as it contains many stores, eateries, hobby centers, salons, and other businesses. Not only is it the largest stretch of stores within Fair Lawn, it also houses one of the highest densities of nail and beauty salons in the United States. The Broadway District stretches from the Route 4 split with Route 208 and continues all through Fair Lawn and includes a few blocks of [[Elmwood Park, New Jersey|Elmwood Park]]. Broadway also hosts the route of local Paterson-New York [[Spanish Company]] minibuses, known locally as [[guagua (minibus)|guaguas]], as a cheaper alternative for commuters to and from New York. It is one of only a handful of Bergen-Passaic-Hudson districts that even offers this service.\n*'''Central Fair Lawn''' is bounded by Morlot and Fair Lawn Avenues on the south and north, respectively, by River Road on the west, and Route 208 on the east and northeast. The borough's Municipal Complex, which houses its administrative, legal, financial, and police divisions, is located in this neighborhood, as are the Fair Lawn Public Library, [[Fair Lawn High School]], and John A. Forrest Elementary School.\n* '''Dunkerhook''', the Dark Corner (Donckerhoek in old Dutch), is on both sides of a former bridge over the Saddle River, in Fair Lawn and Paramus, near Fair Lawn Avenue. The Vanderbeck and Naugle houses there are both from the 18th century.\n* '''The Heights''', more precisely known as \"Columbia Heights\", is located near Hawthorne's industrial section along the Passaic River on Wagaraw Road and Hawthorne's residential area at Lincoln Avenue as well as bordering Bunker Hill in Paterson. This well-maintained neighborhood houses some local industry outside of the McBride Industrial District that borders Glen Rock and is known by some of its residents as the \"Bunker Hill Extension\" or the \"Walsh Area\".\n*'''Hendersonville''', also referred to as \"Riverside East\". This diverse neighborhood, located between Columbia Heights and the Municipal Complex within the \"Westmoreland District\", as well as sharing [[Route 208 (New Jersey)|Route 208]] with the neighboring borough of Glen Rock, is a mostly residential community of two-family Cape Cod-style houses located down the stretch of Henderson Boulevard curving around to 11th Street. Distinct to this neighborhood in comparison with other two-family districts and sections is that each Cape Cod has two doors in the front so each residing family has its own entrance into its respective quarters, a blueprint that was abandoned shortly after being built in favor of a \"one door, two entrances\" model. Westmoreland Elementary School is located in this neighborhood.\n* '''Lyncrest''' neighborhood, located south of Morlot Avenue, in alignment with Paterson's 33rd Street split into that city's Upper Eastside and Eastside neighborhoods, is an extension of the Eastside and notable for its older, stone houses in the footsteps of homes once owned by Paterson's former silk barons. This community is also diverse, with immigrants from Europe, Asia, the Middle East, as well as various parts of the [[Americas]]. It is home to many [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]], [[Indian American]], and [[Russian American]] families, among other ethnic and religious groups. Lyncrest streets \"1st-6th\" are also known by the name of \"Rivercrest\" by locals, due to the split level and [[Cape Cod-style architecture]] of housing located in the \"River Dip\" adjacent to Memorial Park. Lyncrest Elementary School is located in this neighborhood.\n* '''McBride Industrial District''' is the area incorporating the McBride Industrial Park located between Fair Lawn Borough's border with Glen Rock and the Chandler Houses and Fair Lawn Commons communities. It currently houses the former [[Nabisco]] cookie factory, which has played a major role in not only Fair Lawn's identity itself, but also Glen Rock, Ridgewood, Paterson, Prospect Park, Haledon, Hawthorne, and Western Paramus near the Dunkerhook and Saddle River Areas, causing those venturing throughout these areas to coin the nickname \"Cookie-City\" as a general area term, describing the fragrance of freshly baked cookies that filled these areas on baking days. In the past, the McBride Industrial District took up both sides of [[Route 208]], stretching from Fair Lawn Avenue to the intersection at Maple Avenue and Harristown Road, running up to the Bergen County Line train tracks via the Radburn District, and housing companies such as Nabisco, [[Kodak]], [[Maxell]], and others. More recently the district has been in the process of [[deindustrialization]] and corporate [[gentrification]], as older companies fold or move out, replacing industrial properties with residential-commercial \"mini-cities\", as well as the headquarters of New Jersey's Columbia Savings Bank.\n* '''Memorial Park''', a working-class neighborhood (sometimes called the \"River Dip\", \"East River Area\",\"Eastside Dip\", or the more modern \"Yang\"; the aerial view of the neighborhood makes a \"[[Ying Yang]]\" symbol with neighboring East Side Park) within and around the River Road Improvement District with street addresses aligned with the corner of 33rd Street and Martin Luther King Way (Broadway) in neighboring Paterson. The Memorial Park neighborhood borders the Passaic River and contains the park next to Memorial Middle School named Memorial Park which houses a [[World War II]] Memorial commemorating those who fought in the war. The park is the terminus of the annual [[Memorial Day]] parade and the site of the Memorial pool and beach as well as the [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] fireworks show. Residential gentrification is occurring with the leveling of two-family rental housing for more modern single-family housing in this area. \n* '''[[Radburn, New Jersey|Radburn]]''' is a [[planned community]] also housing the landmark ''Radburn Plaza'' building, which was destroyed in a fire in 2002 and subsequently rebuilt. With its safe and easy access to local businesses and schools, and Fair Lawn's largest [[U.S. Postal Service]] branch, this neighborhood also offers commuter trains from [[Radburn station]] to the [[Secaucus Junction]] rail transfer station as well as to the [[Port Authority Trans-Hudson|PATH]] train in [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]], both of which provide rail connections to [[New York City]]. This neighborhood includes Radburn Elementary School and Daly Field. An annual street fair is held here in June.\n* '''Radrock Estates''' is a small neighborhood around two streets, Well Drive and Split Rock Road, with a private park within the block they enclose, reminiscent of nearby Radburn but a separate development built about 1940. The entrance street from Fair Lawn Avenue has an entrance pillar on each side displaying the name. The surrounding area to the north and east, while built after World War II, is considered to be an extended part of Radrock Estates. Although it is a very diverse residential section, this neighborhood shares the conveniences of living in Radburn including dining, retail access, as well as rail access from Radburn Station.\n* The '''River Road Improvement District''', with an annual street fair in autumn, houses many functional businesses, including numerous banks, ethnic restaurants and supermarkets, small offices, retail [[telecommunications]] outlets, both a [[United Parcel Service]] store and a U.S. Post Office branch, and the landmark Joker's Child comic book store. River Road in this district is also zoned for apartments located above businesses.\n* '''Warren Point''', a residential area located near the '''Broadway Improvement District'''. Bordering Saddle Brook and Elmwood Park, it has many stores, big and small, and many eateries. The neighborhood also offers commuter trains from [[Broadway station (NJ Transit)|Broadway station]] to Hoboken's PATH and to Secaucus Junction via the [[Bergen County Line]], as well as the \"Paterson-New York Shuttle\". Warren Point Elementary School and the private [[St. Anne School (Fair Lawn, New Jersey)|St. Anne School]] are located in this neighborhood.\n*The neighborhood stretching along both sides of Saddle River Road in Fair Lawn is not officially named but has its own character as another affluent enclave. This neighborhood includes a portion of the Saddle River, [[Saddle River County Park]], and Fair Lawn's eastern border with Paramus. The whole area is referred to by many as the \"Saddle River District\". Due to obvious differences throughout this side, there are sections that are identified by locals including the \"Dunkerhook section\" (named after the section of the County Park located in the vicinity) starting at around the shared border with Glen Rock and Paramus down to Morlot Avenue. In the spring, summer, and autumn, fishermen frequent this section, as the Saddle River within Dunkerhook is stocked with trout. The neighborhood south of Morlot Avenue is referred to as the \"Saddle River section\", which borders Saddle Brook in addition to Paramus, and which shares access to the Saddle River as well as bike trails for leisure or access to the [[Westfield Garden State Plaza]] mall in Paramus.\n\nThere also exist more intricate micro-neighborhoods within macro-neighborhoods throughout the borough, such as \"Fair Lawn Commons\" (The Commons) off Route 208, located within the Radburn Historical District, yet which has a separate, more affluent feel and modern look and subculture; Radburn's El Dorado Village, which is known for its [[Eastern European]] immigrant residents; and just to its west, the \"Chandler Houses\". Fair Lawn's newest neighborhood is Fair Lawn Promenade (The Promenade), a [[mixed-use development]] extending northward from The Commons along Highway 208 North, consisting of apartments, shops, offices, and restaurants, with the motto to be able to \"live, shop, work, and play\" in one locale.\n\nThese distinct communities are located throughout the borough, and each has its own character, making Fair Lawn not just ethnically, racially, and religiously diverse, but also an experientially diverse borough notable even amidst Bergen County's diversity on a larger scale.\n\n==Ethnic diversity==\nFair Lawn has a longstanding tradition of [[ethnic diversity]] and a tolerance for people of different ethnicities and religious faiths. Continuing steady immigration from [[Eurasia]], [[Asia]], [[Europe]], and [[Latin America]] has transformed Fair Lawn into an international [[melting pot]], and over 50 languages and dialects are spoken in the borough.\n\n===History of ethnic diversity===\nFair Lawn has been a center for [[Jewish culture]] over a period spanning several decades. Since the early 2000s, the [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] population has been increasing significantly and has replaced the earlier decreases in members of the non-Orthodox Jewish sects. After the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991, [[Russian Jews]] began to migrate to Fair Lawn.<ref>Strunsky, Steve.

Less than 1% of addresses in New Jersey use this kind of numbering system and Fair Lawn's nearly 10,000 hyphenated addresses account for nearly half of them. This numbering system is also used in [[Queens]], New York City. Exceptions to this numbering system generally exist on the Glen Rock, [[Hawthorne, New Jersey|Hawthorne]], and [[Saddle Brook, New Jersey|Saddle Brook]] sides of Fair Lawn and within the Radburn development. The system, dating at least as far back as the 1930s, was designed to allow emergency personnel to quickly locate addresses.<ref name=Record2015/>\n\nThe first numbers (before the dash) correspond to block-distances from Broadway (on streets that run North-South) and to the numbered streets in the borough (example: 2nd Street, 17th Street, etc.) on the streets that run East-West; with the highest numbers being in the low 40s, and the lowest numbers being 0-30, etc. Addresses south of Broadway / Route 4 start with a zero and a hyphen, which can cause confusion with those unfamiliar with the grid system. Most GPS systems and online address entry forms do not accept the dash, though addresses entered without the dash are typically handled properly.<ref name=Record2015>Diduch, Mary.

The new colonists turned the region, part of the [[New Barbadoes Township, New Jersey|New Barbadoes Township]], into five large farm lots, conjoined by two main roads - Paramus and Saddle River - and named it \"slooterdam\" (after a V-shaped [[sluice]]-like fishing [[weir]] built in the Passaic River by the Lenni Lenape).  The name stuck until 1791.  In the 1800s, these five lots became nine smaller lots, and three new roads - Fair Lawn Avenue, Lincoln Avenue, and Prospect Street - were constructed to encourage mobility between them.  Eighty houses were built by 1861, and the renamed Small Lots, now a part of the Saddle River Township and home to multiple vegetable and fruit farms and dairies, became an agricultural community.  Berdan Avenue, a new road located near five Berdan family farms, was soon added and Victorian homes were built alongside it and in nearby areas.  The grandest of the estates, perched atop a hill by Small Lots Road was David Acker's estate \"Fairlawn,\" from which the township gets its name (Images of America, Page 7).\n\nRapid suburban development of the town occurred in three sections: the River Road-Fair Lawn Avenue area known as \"Memorial Park\", the area at Lincoln Avenue and Wagaraw Road known as \"Columbus Heights\", and the area east of the railroad and south of Broadway, known as Warren Point. The development of this section was catalyzed by the \"establishment of a post office, a railroad station, and a trolley to the Hudson River\" (Images of America, Page 8).\n\nIn the 1900s, Fair Lawn residents were displeased about the schooling situation as part of Saddle River Township; the schools were either dilapidated or too far away for Fair Lawn residents, and citizens felt that they were not getting schools comparable to the tax money they were paying. As such, a movement to separate from Saddle River Township was born. Fair Lawn residents petitioned to the state, asking to incorporate as an independent borough, and in April 1924, the borough of Fair Lawn was voted into existence.\n\nFair Lawn is home to the following eight sites listed on the National Register of Historic Places:<ref>[http://www.nj.gov/dep/hpo/1identify/nrsr_lists/Bergen.pdf New Jersey and National Registers of Historic Places - Bergen County], [[New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection]] Historic Preservation Office, last updated November 20, 2017.

Accessed May 21, 2015.</ref>\n\n*'''Berdan Grove''', a residential neighborhood of single-family homes behind Thomas Jefferson Middle School, surrounding Berdan Grove Park on Berdan Avenue. This neighborhood is home to the borough's highest concentration of [[Asian American]]s and includes Milnes Elementary School.\n*'''Broadway District''' contains the major commercial thoroughfare of Broadway and houses the Broadway District commuter stop for NJ Transit's Bergen County Line train. Roughly located around the Warren Point and Lyncrest areas, the district also extends as far as Morlot Avenue along the tracks, roughly around or a little after Glen Rock Lumber, housing many industries on Banta Place. The Broadway District is mainly a shopping district as it contains many stores, eateries, hobby centers, salons, and other businesses. Not only is it the largest stretch of stores within Fair Lawn, it also houses one of the highest densities of nail and beauty salons in the United States. The Broadway District stretches from the Route 4 split with Route 208 and continues all through Fair Lawn and includes a few blocks of [[Elmwood Park, New Jersey|Elmwood Park]]. Broadway also hosts the route of local Paterson-New York [[Spanish Company]] minibuses, known locally as [[guagua (minibus)|guaguas]], as a cheaper alternative for commuters to and from New York. It is one of only a handful of Bergen-Passaic-Hudson districts that even offers this service.\n*'''Central Fair Lawn''' is bounded by Morlot and Fair Lawn Avenues on the south and north, respectively, by River Road on the west, and Route 208 on the east and northeast. The borough's Municipal Complex, which houses its administrative, legal, financial, and police divisions, is located in this neighborhood, as are the Fair Lawn Public Library, [[Fair Lawn High School]], and John A. Forrest Elementary School.\n* '''Dunkerhook''', the Dark Corner (Donckerhoek in old Dutch), is on both sides of a former bridge over the Saddle River, in Fair Lawn and Paramus, near Fair Lawn Avenue. The Vanderbeck and Naugle houses there are both from the 18th century.\n* '''The Heights''', more precisely known as \"Columbia Heights\", is located near Hawthorne's industrial section along the Passaic River on Wagaraw Road and Hawthorne's residential area at Lincoln Avenue as well as bordering Bunker Hill in Paterson. This well-maintained neighborhood houses some local industry outside of the McBride Industrial District that borders Glen Rock and is known by some of its residents as the \"Bunker Hill Extension\" or the \"Walsh Area\".\n*'''Hendersonville''', also referred to as \"Riverside East\". This diverse neighborhood, located between Columbia Heights and the Municipal Complex within the \"Westmoreland District\", as well as sharing [[Route 208 (New Jersey)|Route 208]] with the neighboring borough of Glen Rock, is a mostly residential community of two-family Cape Cod-style houses located down the stretch of Henderson Boulevard curving around to 11th Street. Distinct to this neighborhood in comparison with other two-family districts and sections is that each Cape Cod has two doors in the front so each residing family has its own entrance into its respective quarters, a blueprint that was abandoned shortly after being built in favor of a \"one door, two entrances\" model. Westmoreland Elementary School is located in this neighborhood.\n* '''Lyncrest''' neighborhood, located south of Morlot Avenue, in alignment with Paterson's 33rd Street split into that city's Upper Eastside and Eastside neighborhoods, is an extension of the Eastside and notable for its older, stone houses in the footsteps of homes once owned by Paterson's former silk barons. This community is also diverse, with immigrants from Europe, Asia, the Middle East, as well as various parts of the [[Americas]]. It is home to many [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]], [[Indian American]], and [[Russian American]] families, among other ethnic and religious groups. Lyncrest streets \"1st-6th\" are also known by the name of \"Rivercrest\" by locals, due to the split level and [[Cape Cod-style architecture]] of housing located in the \"River Dip\" adjacent to Memorial Park. Lyncrest Elementary School is located in this neighborhood.\n* '''McBride Industrial District''' is the area incorporating the McBride Industrial Park located between Fair Lawn Borough's border with Glen Rock and the Chandler Houses and Fair Lawn Commons communities. It currently houses the former [[Nabisco]] cookie factory, which has played a major role in not only Fair Lawn's identity itself, but also Glen Rock, Ridgewood, Paterson, Prospect Park, Haledon, Hawthorne, and Western Paramus near the Dunkerhook and Saddle River Areas, causing those venturing throughout these areas to coin the nickname \"Cookie-City\" as a general area term, describing the fragrance of freshly baked cookies that filled these areas on baking days. In the past, the McBride Industrial District took up both sides of [[Route 208]], stretching from Fair Lawn Avenue to the intersection at Maple Avenue and Harristown Road, running up to the Bergen County Line train tracks via the Radburn District, and housing companies such as Nabisco, [[Kodak]], [[Maxell]], and others. More recently the district has been in the process of [[deindustrialization]] and corporate [[gentrification]], as older companies fold or move out, replacing industrial properties with residential-commercial \"mini-cities\", as well as the headquarters of New Jersey's Columbia Savings Bank.\n* '''Memorial Park''', a working-class neighborhood (sometimes called the \"River Dip\", \"East River Area\",\"Eastside Dip\", or the more modern \"Yang\"; the aerial view of the neighborhood makes a \"[[Ying Yang]]\" symbol with neighboring East Side Park) within and around the River Road Improvement District with street addresses aligned with the corner of 33rd Street and Martin Luther King Way (Broadway) in neighboring Paterson. The Memorial Park neighborhood borders the Passaic River and contains the park next to Memorial Middle School named Memorial Park which houses a [[World War II]] Memorial commemorating those who fought in the war. The park is the terminus of the annual [[Memorial Day]] parade and the site of the Memorial pool and beach as well as the [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] fireworks show. Residential gentrification is occurring with the leveling of two-family rental housing for more modern single-family housing in this area. \n* '''[[Radburn, New Jersey|Radburn]]''' is a [[planned community]] also housing the landmark ''Radburn Plaza'' building, which was destroyed in a fire in 2002 and subsequently rebuilt. With its safe and easy access to local businesses and schools, and Fair Lawn's largest [[U.S. Postal Service]] branch, this neighborhood also offers commuter trains from [[Radburn station]] to the [[Secaucus Junction]] rail transfer station as well as to the [[Port Authority Trans-Hudson|PATH]] train in [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]], both of which provide rail connections to [[New York City]]. This neighborhood includes Radburn Elementary School and Daly Field. An annual street fair is held here in June.\n* '''Radrock Estates''' is a small neighborhood around two streets, Well Drive and Split Rock Road, with a private park within the block they enclose, reminiscent of nearby Radburn but a separate development built about 1940. The entrance street from Fair Lawn Avenue has an entrance pillar on each side displaying the name. The surrounding area to the north and east, while built after World War II, is considered to be an extended part of Radrock Estates. Although it is a very diverse residential section, this neighborhood shares the conveniences of living in Radburn including dining, retail access, as well as rail access from Radburn Station.\n* The '''River Road Improvement District''', with an annual street fair in autumn, houses many functional businesses, including numerous banks, ethnic restaurants and supermarkets, small offices, retail [[telecommunications]] outlets, both a [[United Parcel Service]] store and a U.S. Post Office branch, and the landmark Joker's Child comic book store. River Road in this district is also zoned for apartments located above businesses.\n* '''Warren Point''', a residential area located near the '''Broadway Improvement District'''. Bordering Saddle Brook and Elmwood Park, it has many stores, big and small, and many eateries. The neighborhood also offers commuter trains from [[Broadway station (NJ Transit)|Broadway station]] to Hoboken's PATH and to Secaucus Junction via the [[Bergen County Line]], as well as the \"Paterson-New York Shuttle\". Warren Point Elementary School and the private [[St. Anne School (Fair Lawn, New Jersey)|St. Anne School]] are located in this neighborhood.\n*The neighborhood stretching along both sides of Saddle River Road in Fair Lawn is not officially named but has its own character as another affluent enclave. This neighborhood includes a portion of the Saddle River, [[Saddle River County Park]], and Fair Lawn's eastern border with Paramus. The whole area is referred to by many as the \"Saddle River District\". Due to obvious differences throughout this side, there are sections that are identified by locals including the \"Dunkerhook section\" (named after the section of the County Park located in the vicinity) starting at around the shared border with Glen Rock and Paramus down to Morlot Avenue. In the spring, summer, and autumn, fishermen frequent this section, as the Saddle River within Dunkerhook is stocked with trout. The neighborhood south of Morlot Avenue is referred to as the \"Saddle River section\", which borders Saddle Brook in addition to Paramus, and which shares access to the Saddle River as well as bike trails for leisure or access to the [[Westfield Garden State Plaza]] mall in Paramus.\n\nThere also exist more intricate micro-neighborhoods within macro-neighborhoods throughout the borough, such as \"Fair Lawn Commons\" (The Commons) off Route 208, located within the Radburn Historical District, yet which has a separate, more affluent feel and modern look and subculture; Radburn's El Dorado Village, which is known for its [[Eastern European]] immigrant residents; and just to its west, the \"Chandler Houses\". Fair Lawn's newest neighborhood is Fair Lawn Promenade (The Promenade), a [[mixed-use development]] extending northward from The Commons along Highway 208 North, consisting of apartments, shops, offices, and restaurants, with the motto to be able to \"live, shop, work, and play\" in one locale.\n\nThese distinct communities are located throughout the borough, and each has its own character, making Fair Lawn not just ethnically, racially, and religiously diverse, but also an experientially diverse borough notable even amidst Bergen County's diversity on a larger scale.\n\n==Ethnic diversity==\nFair Lawn has a longstanding tradition of [[ethnic diversity]] and a tolerance for people of different ethnicities and religious faiths. Continuing steady immigration from [[Eurasia]], [[Asia]], [[Europe]], and [[Latin America]] has transformed Fair Lawn into an international [[melting pot]], and over 50 languages and dialects are spoken in the borough.\n\n===History of ethnic diversity===\nFair Lawn has been a center for [[Jewish culture]] over a period spanning several decades. Since the early 2000s, the [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] population has been increasing significantly and has replaced the earlier decreases in members of the non-Orthodox Jewish sects. After the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991, [[Russian Jews]] began to migrate to Fair Lawn.<ref>Strunsky, Steve.

Readers cannot be [[Gullibility|gullible]] but also should not be [[Paranoia|paranoid]] that all [[information]] is incorrect. There is always a chance that even readers who have this balance will believe an error to be true or that they will disregard factual information as incorrect. According to Libicki, readers' prior [[belief]]s or [[opinion]]s also affect how they interpret new information. When readers believe something to be true before researching it, they are more likely to believe something that supports these prior beliefs or opinions.

Afterwards, the U.S. attorney general at the time, Alberto Gonzales, repeated the claim. However, the number that Hansen used in his reporting had no backing. Hansen said he received the information from ''Dateline'' expert Ken Lanning, but Lanning admitted that he made up the number 50,000 because there was no solid data on the number. According to Lanning, he used 50,000 because it sounds like a real number, not too big and not too small, and referred to it as a \"[[Goldilocks and the Three Bears|Goldilocks]] number\".

[[News media]] companies broadcast stories 24 hours a day, and break the latest news in hopes of taking audience share from their competitors. News is also produced at a pace that does not always allow for fact-checking, or for all of the facts to be collected or released to the media at one time, letting readers or viewers insert their own opinions, and possibly leading to the spread of misinformation.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Croteau | display-authors=etal | title=Media Technology | pages=285\u2013321 | url=http://www.sagepub.com/upm-data/40857_9.pdf | accessdate=March 21, 2013 | journal= | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102172415/http://www.sagepub.com/upm-data/40857_9.pdf | archive-date=January 2, 2013 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Impact==\nMisinformation can affect all aspects of life. When [[eavesdropping]] on conversations, one can gather facts that may not always be true, or the receiver may hear the message incorrectly and spread the information to others. On the Internet, one can read content that is stated to be factual but that that may not have been checked or may be erroneous. In the news, companies may emphasize the speed at which they receive and send information but may not always be correct in the facts. These developments contribute to the way misinformation will continue to complicate the public's understanding of issues and to serve as a source for belief and attitude formation.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=1Jo7DwAAQBAJ&pg=PT246&dq=misinformation+causes#v=onepage&q=misinformation%20causes&f=false|title=Misinformation and Mass Audiences|last=Southwell|first=Brian G.|last2=Thorson|first2=Emily A.|last3=Sheble|first3=Laura|date=2018|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=978-1477314586|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn regards to [[politics]], some view being a misinformed citizen as worse than being an uninformed citizen. Misinformed citizens can state their beliefs and opinions with confidence and in turn affect elections and policies. This type of misinformation comes from speakers not always being upfront and straightforward.

News is also produced at a pace that does not always allow for fact-checking, or for all of the facts to be collected or released to the media at one time, letting readers or viewers insert their own opinions, and possibly leading to the spread of misinformation.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Croteau | display-authors=etal | title=Media Technology | pages=285\u2013321 | url=http://www.sagepub.com/upm-data/40857_9.pdf | accessdate=March 21, 2013 | journal= | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102172415/http://www.sagepub.com/upm-data/40857_9.pdf | archive-date=January 2, 2013 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Impact==\nMisinformation can affect all aspects of life. When [[eavesdropping]] on conversations, one can gather facts that may not always be true, or the receiver may hear the message incorrectly and spread the information to others. On the Internet, one can read content that is stated to be factual but that that may not have been checked or may be erroneous. In the news, companies may emphasize the speed at which they receive and send information but may not always be correct in the facts. These developments contribute to the way misinformation will continue to complicate the public's understanding of issues and to serve as a source for belief and attitude formation.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=1Jo7DwAAQBAJ&pg=PT246&dq=misinformation+causes#v=onepage&q=misinformation%20causes&f=false|title=Misinformation and Mass Audiences|last=Southwell|first=Brian G.|last2=Thorson|first2=Emily A.|last3=Sheble|first3=Laura|date=2018|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=978-1477314586|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn regards to [[politics]], some view being a misinformed citizen as worse than being an uninformed citizen. Misinformed citizens can state their beliefs and opinions with confidence and in turn affect elections and policies. This type of misinformation comes from speakers not always being upfront and straightforward. When information is presented as vague, ambiguous, sarcastic, or partial, receivers are forced to piece the information together and assume what is correct.<ref>{{cite book | last=Barker | first=David | title=Rushed to Judgement: Talk Radio, Persuasion, and American Political Behavior | year=2002 | publisher=Columbia University Press | location=New York | pages=106\u2013109}}</ref> Aside from [[Propaganda|political propaganda]], misinformation can also be employed in industrial propaganda. Using tools such as advertising, a company can undermine reliable evidence or influence belief through concerted misinformation campaign.
