Both featured Smith as the sole performer of multiple and diverse characters, based on interviews she had conducted with numerous residents and commentators in the two cities where riots took place. For these works, she won the [[Drama Desk Award for Outstanding One-Person Show]] two years in a row. She interviewed more than 100 people as part of her creation of ''Fires in the Mirror'', which dealt with the 1991 [[Crown Heights riot]].

His occupation was listed as veterinarian. In 1858, he moved his wife and four children from the slave state of Maryland to the free state of Pennsylvania. He chose to settle in Gettysburg. Another newsworthy article was found in the Cleveland Gazette (1892) which referred to Basil Biggs as the \"wealthiest Afro-American in Gettysburg,\" mentioning his great home on 120 acres.<ref>Public Broadcasting System television series, Season 2, Episode 3:  Finding Your Roots</ref> \n\nIn early 2017, Smith worked with [[Melissa McCarthy]] in the film [[Can You Ever Forgive Me?

Her ancestry in America was revealed to her for the first time. She was descended from a long line of free people of color. The most striking facts were linked to her great, great grandfather, Basil Biggs, born 1820 in Maryland. He and his wife Mary were listed in the 1850 U.S. census to be free.  His occupation was listed as veterinarian. In 1858, he moved his wife and four children from the slave state of Maryland to the free state of Pennsylvania. He chose to settle in Gettysburg. Another newsworthy article was found in the Cleveland Gazette (1892) which referred to Basil Biggs as the \"wealthiest Afro-American in Gettysburg,\" mentioning his great home on 120 acres.<ref>Public Broadcasting System television series, Season 2, Episode 3:  Finding Your Roots</ref> \n\nIn early 2017, Smith worked with [[Melissa McCarthy]] in the film [[Can You Ever Forgive Me? (film)|''Can You Ever Forgive Me?'']] In New York City, they filmed one scene together in which their characters briefly reunite for the first time after the long-ago end of their relationship. Smith's character is a university professor of literature. In October 2018, this film was distributed to cinemas by [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]].\n\n===Teacher===\nSmith teaches in the Department of Art & Public Policy at the [[Tisch School of the Arts]] at [[New York University]]. In 1986, she joined the faculty of the [[University of Southern California]] School of Dramatic Arts.  From 1990 to 2000, she was a professor in the drama department at [[Stanford University]] and prior to that taught at [[Carnegie Mellon University]].

Starting from 1874, some classes of Literature, Law and Applied Sciences were given at the building of [[Galatasaray High School]], which continued regularly until 1881.
