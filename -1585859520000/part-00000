The game is separated into three different modes:\n\nVillage Mode \u2014 A top-down, central hub where the player progresses the story and interacts with the Raposa, purchases items from the item shop using rapo-coins collected in Adventure Mode, and accesses levels. Players draw different items at the Raposa's request to enrich their village. Over the course of the game in Village Mode, the player plays [[minigame]]s, participate in a town festival, hunt for a thief, and help the Raposa thrive. Here players are given their objective for the next Adventure Mode level. \n[[Image:Drawn to Life gameplay.jpg|thumb|right|''Drawn to Life'' screenshot]]\nThere are three main buildings in this mode - Creation Hall, where players can edit their previous creations, and the item shop, where players can purchase songs, patterns, stamps, and even new abilities for their hero. Also, there is a wishing well in which players can dump rapo-coins to get prizes. The 10,000 rapo-coin grand prize is Developer's Grove, where the Hero can meet sprites of the game's developers.\n\nAdventure Mode \u2014 A side-scrolling platformer with 16 levels. Here, the player battles enemies, rescues Raposa, and collects items. Players draw platforms that allow them to progress through the level. The levels exist in one of four different worlds: Ice, Forest, Tropical, and City, each with its own [[Boss monster|boss]].\n\nPlayers are tasked with rescuing three Raposa and four pieces of a page from the [[Book of Life]], which has to be used to create a new village object. Players can also collect secret orbs that will then unlock and be purchasable in the item shop. In each section of the levels, players tap on an easel icon to enable Draw Mode, which tells the player to draw a new type of platform or object. Once drawn, the player goes back to Adventure Mode and can then interact with the newly-drawn object.\n\nDraw Mode \u2014 The tool through which players create new objects, weapons, and their hero. This is done through the stylus and touchscreen. Once drawn, objects and the hero will animate. The player can design up to three different humanoid heroes using a variety of colors, patterns, and stamps. Character creation also features 15 pre-made character templates which can be traced, or have their body parts used for those who are less artistic. The game's title screen can be drawn and saved, so players can make their own title screen.\n\nPlayers can trade their drawn heroes and other objects via local Wi-Fi only.\n\n==Plot==\nThe main \"race\" of creatures inhabiting the universe of ''Drawn to Life'' are anthropomorphic fox-like beings known as the \"Raposa\" (''raposa'' meaning \"fox\" in Portuguese). They were drawn by the Creator, who also drew their world and everything upon it, however is believed to have abandoned the Raposa long ago.\n\nThe story begins with a Raposa named Mari crying out to the player, the Creator, to help save the village she lives in. Along the way, the player meets her best friend, Jowee, and her father, the Mayor. These characters are the last remaining villagers. The player designs a hero for them, and then runs into Wilfre, a corrupted Raposa that dabbled in creation, and spawned a legion of evil shadow-like creatures. The player starts by rescuing the Mayor, who sets off to bring back the Raposa to the Village. As the player progresses, the player learns that Wilfre was once a prominent member of the Village, and that in his lust for power, he stole the Book of Life, and tore the pages from it. The Mayor asks the player to find and return the pages of the Book of Life, so the Creator can once again draw the missing objects from the Village.\n\nThe player starts by designing the Eternal Flame, which is then used to clear the darkness from each section of the Village each time the player returns from completing a level. Along the way, the player rescues a cast of villagers, who agree to return to the Village and open up shops, restaurants, and other places of interest. Mari begins training to take over as Mayor, and the Village plans a festival to celebrate. Meanwhile, adventure-hungry Jowee sneaks into a level, and the player has to save him and help find an appropriate gift for Mari. This reckless act causes a rift between Jowee and Mari, but they eventually make up and grow closer as they help the Hero restore the Village to what it once was.\n\nAfter numerous confrontations with Wilfre, he finally tricks the Mayor into appearing alone, and attacks him, stealing the Book of Life as well. Everyone tries to help the Mayor but a Raposa named Dr. Cure says she can do nothing for him. Everyone is devastated, but after seeing the Village's creations are vanishing, they decide to band together and stop Wilfre for good. The Hero defeats Wilfre, and returns to the Village. Jowee plans to leave on a Treasure Hunt, and after saying goodbye, Mari reminisces about the past, upset about losing her father and best friend. The story ends with Mari on the beach, shocked at seeing Jowee walk up behind her. She runs to him happily, watched over by the spirit of the Mayor, and the Hero, on the cliff above.\n\n== Soundtrack ==\n''Drawn to Life'' has over 40 songs which can be purchased in the game's item shop using rapo-coins. The game also includes a full vocal track for the ending, named \"The End\", composed by David J. Franco (the game's music and sound designer), sung by Hayley Chipman and David J Franco.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical reviews===\n{{Video game reviews\n| DS = true\n| iOS = true\n| na = true\n| EuroG_DS = 6/10<ref>{{cite web |author=Lyon, James |date=September 26, 2007 |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/r_dsroundup_2609?page=2 |title=DS Roundup (Page 2) |publisher=[[Eurogamer]] |accessdate=January 14, 2016}}</ref>\n| Fam_DS = 31/40<ref name=\"fam\">{{cite web |author=Brian |date=November 26, 2008 |url=http://nintendoeverything.com/famitsu-review-scores-28/ |title=Famitsu review scores |publisher=Nintendo Everything |accessdate=January 14, 2016}}</ref>\n| GI_DS = 7/10<ref>{{cite journal |author=Miller, Matt |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/NR/exeres/705E7FBB-114B-483D-BCF4-D24895477485.htm? |title=Drawn to Life |journal=[[Game Informer]] |issue=174 |date=October 2007 |page=127 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080112225145/http://www.gameinformer.com/NR/exeres/705E7FBB-114B-483D-BCF4-D24895477485.htm |archivedate=January 12, 2008 |url-status=dead |accessdate=January 14, 2016 }}</ref>\n| GamePro_DS = {{Rating|4.5|5}}<ref>{{cite journal |author=EmaWii |url=http://www.gamepro.com/nintendo/ds/games/reviews/133588.shtml |title=Review: Drawn to Life |journal=[[GamePro]] |date=October 2007 |page=87 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080202233704/http://www.gamepro.com/nintendo/ds/games/reviews/133588.shtml |archivedate=February 2, 2008 |url-status=dead |accessdate=January 15, 2016}}</ref>\n| GameRev_DS = B<ref>{{cite web |last=Damiano |first=Greg |date=October 22, 2007 |url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/drawn-to-life |title=Drawn to Life Review |publisher=[[Game Revolution]] |accessdate=January 15, 2016}}</ref>\n| GSpot_DS = 7.5/10<ref>{{cite web |author=Navarro, Alex |date=September 17, 2007 |url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/drawn-to-life-review/1900-6178918/ |title=Drawn to Life Review |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=January 14, 2016}}</ref>\n| GSpy_DS = {{Rating|3.5|5}}<ref>{{cite web |author=Stratton, Bryan |date=September 14, 2007 |url=http://ds.gamespy.com/nintendo-ds/drawn-to-life/820317p1.html |title=GameSpy: Drawn to Life |publisher=[[GameSpy]] |accessdate=January 14, 2016}}</ref>\n| GameZone_DS = 7.5/10<ref>{{cite web |author=Woodward, Stephen |date=September 26, 2007 |url=http://www.gamezone.com/reviews/drawn_to_life_nds_review |title=Drawn to Life - NDS - Review |publisher=GameZone |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081229170713/http://nds.gamezone.com/gzreviews/r32649.htm |archivedate=December 29, 2008 |url-status=live |accessdate=January 15, 2016}}</ref>\n| IGN_DS = 7.9/10<ref>{{cite web |author=Bozon, Mark |date=September 10, 2007 |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/09/10/drawn-to-life-review |title=Drawn to Life Review |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=January 14, 2016}}</ref>\n| NP_DS = 7.5/10<ref>{{cite journal |title=Drawn to Life Review |journal=Nintendo Power |volume=221 |date=November 2007 |page=105}}</ref>\n| MC_DS = 73/100<ref name=\"mcds\">{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/ds/drawn-to-life |title=Drawn to Life for DS Reviews |publisher=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=January 14, 2016}}</ref>\n| MC_iOS = 53/100<ref name=\"mcios\">{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/ios/drawn-to-life |title=Drawn to Life for iPhone/iPad Reviews |publisher=Metacritic |accessdate=January 14, 2016}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThe game received \"mixed or average reviews\" on both platforms according to video game [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]].<ref name=\"mcds\"/><ref name=\"mcios\"/> In Japan, ''[[Famitsu]]'' gave the DS version a score of three eights and one seven for a total of 31 out of 40.<ref name=\"fam\"/>\n\n===Awards===\nThe DS version of ''Drawn to Life'' was nominated for Outstanding Achievement in Story Development at the 11th [[Annual Interactive Achievement Awards]] along with ''[[BioShock]]'', ''[[Mass Effect (video game)|Mass Effect]]'' and ''[[Uncharted: Drake's Fortune]]'' during the [[D.I.C.E.

Naega Mandeuneun Sesang'''''. In the game, the player creates their own playable characters, level objects, and accessories by drawing them using the DS's stylus and touchscreen. The game was ported to [[iOS]] by [[WayForward|WayForward Technologies]] and released by [[505 Games]] on May 21, 2014.\n\n''Drawn to Life'' requires the player to create a hero in order to free a cursed village from an encroaching darkness. It features numerous platforming levels, a top-down central village, and other elements such as vehicles, weapons, and platforms, which are drawn or colored by the player using the stylus.\n\nTwo sequels have come out, both under the title ''[[Drawn to Life: The Next Chapter (Nintendo DS)|Drawn to Life: The Next Chapter]]'', for release on the DS and [[Drawn to Life: The Next Chapter (Wii)|Wii]].<ref name=\"sequel\">{{cite web |author=Rosenberg, Jared |date=May 26, 2009 |url=http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/news/18548/the-drawn-to-life-adventure-continues-on-wii-n-ds |title=The Drawn to Life Adventure Continues on Wii & DS |publisher=Nintendo World Report |accessdate=January 14, 2016}}</ref> A spin-off title, ''[[Drawn to Life: SpongeBob SquarePants Edition]]'' (based on the ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' episode \"[[SpongeBob SquarePants (season 2)#ep34b|Frankendoodle]]\"), was developed by [[Altron]] for the DS.\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Drawn to Life'' is a 2D game where the player must draw their own character, weapons and accessories, platforms, and objects. The game is separated into three different modes:\n\nVillage Mode \u2014 A top-down, central hub where the player progresses the story and interacts with the Raposa, purchases items from the item shop using rapo-coins collected in Adventure Mode, and accesses levels. Players draw different items at the Raposa's request to enrich their village. Over the course of the game in Village Mode, the player plays [[minigame]]s, participate in a town festival, hunt for a thief, and help the Raposa thrive. Here players are given their objective for the next Adventure Mode level. \n[[Image:Drawn to Life gameplay.jpg|thumb|right|''Drawn to Life'' screenshot]]\nThere are three main buildings in this mode - Creation Hall, where players can edit their previous creations, and the item shop, where players can purchase songs, patterns, stamps, and even new abilities for their hero. Also, there is a wishing well in which players can dump rapo-coins to get prizes. The 10,000 rapo-coin grand prize is Developer's Grove, where the Hero can meet sprites of the game's developers.\n\nAdventure Mode \u2014 A side-scrolling platformer with 16 levels. Here, the player battles enemies, rescues Raposa, and collects items. Players draw platforms that allow them to progress through the level. The levels exist in one of four different worlds: Ice, Forest, Tropical, and City, each with its own [[Boss monster|boss]].\n\nPlayers are tasked with rescuing three Raposa and four pieces of a page from the [[Book of Life]], which has to be used to create a new village object. Players can also collect secret orbs that will then unlock and be purchasable in the item shop. In each section of the levels, players tap on an easel icon to enable Draw Mode, which tells the player to draw a new type of platform or object. Once drawn, the player goes back to Adventure Mode and can then interact with the newly-drawn object.\n\nDraw Mode \u2014 The tool through which players create new objects, weapons, and their hero. This is done through the stylus and touchscreen. Once drawn, objects and the hero will animate. The player can design up to three different humanoid heroes using a variety of colors, patterns, and stamps. Character creation also features 15 pre-made character templates which can be traced, or have their body parts used for those who are less artistic. The game's title screen can be drawn and saved, so players can make their own title screen.\n\nPlayers can trade their drawn heroes and other objects via local Wi-Fi only.\n\n==Plot==\nThe main \"race\" of creatures inhabiting the universe of ''Drawn to Life'' are anthropomorphic fox-like beings known as the \"Raposa\" (''raposa'' meaning \"fox\" in Portuguese). They were drawn by the Creator, who also drew their world and everything upon it, however is believed to have abandoned the Raposa long ago.\n\nThe story begins with a Raposa named Mari crying out to the player, the Creator, to help save the village she lives in. Along the way, the player meets her best friend, Jowee, and her father, the Mayor. These characters are the last remaining villagers. The player designs a hero for them, and then runs into Wilfre, a corrupted Raposa that dabbled in creation, and spawned a legion of evil shadow-like creatures. The player starts by rescuing the Mayor, who sets off to bring back the Raposa to the Village. As the player progresses, the player learns that Wilfre was once a prominent member of the Village, and that in his lust for power, he stole the Book of Life, and tore the pages from it. The Mayor asks the player to find and return the pages of the Book of Life, so the Creator can once again draw the missing objects from the Village. \n\nThe player starts by designing the Eternal Flame, which is then used to clear the darkness from each section of the Village each time the player returns from completing a level. Along the way, the player rescues a cast of villagers, who agree to return to the Village and open up shops, restaurants, and other places of interest. Mari begins training to take over as Mayor, and the Village plans a festival to celebrate. Meanwhile, adventure-hungry Jowee sneaks into a level, and the player has to save him and help find an appropriate gift for Mari. This reckless act causes a rift between Jowee and Mari, but they eventually make up and grow closer as they help the Hero restore the Village to what it once was.\n\nAfter numerous confrontations with Wilfre, he finally tricks the Mayor into appearing alone, and attacks him, stealing the Book of Life as well. Everyone tries to help the Mayor but a Raposa named Dr. Cure says she can do nothing for him. Everyone is devastated, but after seeing the Village's creations are vanishing, they decide to band together and stop Wilfre for good. The Hero defeats Wilfre, and returns to the Village. Jowee plans to leave on a Treasure Hunt, and after saying goodbye, Mari reminisces about the past, upset about losing her father and best friend. The story ends with Mari on the beach, shocked at seeing Jowee walk up behind her. She runs to him happily, watched over by the spirit of the Mayor, and the Hero, on the cliff above.\n\n== Soundtrack ==\n''Drawn to Life'' has over 40 songs which can be purchased in the game's item shop using rapo-coins. The game also includes a full vocal track for the ending, named \"The End\", composed by David J. Franco (the game's music and sound designer), sung by Hayley Chipman and David J Franco.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical reviews===\n{{Video game reviews\n| DS = true\n| iOS = true\n| na = true\n| EuroG_DS = 6/10<ref>{{cite web |author=Lyon, James |date=September 26, 2007 |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/r_dsroundup_2609?page=2 |title=DS Roundup (Page 2) |publisher=[[Eurogamer]] |accessdate=January 14, 2016}}</ref>\n| Fam_DS = 31/40<ref name=\"fam\">{{cite web |author=Brian |date=November 26, 2008 |url=http://nintendoeverything.com/famitsu-review-scores-28/ |title=Famitsu review scores |publisher=Nintendo Everything |accessdate=January 14, 2016}}</ref>\n| GI_DS = 7/10<ref>{{cite journal |author=Miller, Matt |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/NR/exeres/705E7FBB-114B-483D-BCF4-D24895477485.htm? |title=Drawn to Life |journal=[[Game Informer]] |issue=174 |date=October 2007 |page=127 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080112225145/http://www.gameinformer.com/NR/exeres/705E7FBB-114B-483D-BCF4-D24895477485.htm |archivedate=January 12, 2008 |url-status=dead |accessdate=January 14, 2016 }}</ref>\n| GamePro_DS = {{Rating|4.5|5}}<ref>{{cite journal |author=EmaWii |url=http://www.gamepro.com/nintendo/ds/games/reviews/133588.shtml |title=Review: Drawn to Life |journal=[[GamePro]] |date=October 2007 |page=87 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080202233704/http://www.gamepro.com/nintendo/ds/games/reviews/133588.shtml |archivedate=February 2, 2008 |url-status=dead |accessdate=January 15, 2016}}</ref>\n| GameRev_DS = B<ref>{{cite web |last=Damiano |first=Greg |date=October 22, 2007 |url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/drawn-to-life |title=Drawn to Life Review |publisher=[[Game Revolution]] |accessdate=January 15, 2016}}</ref>\n| GSpot_DS = 7.5/10<ref>{{cite web |author=Navarro, Alex |date=September 17, 2007 |url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/drawn-to-life-review/1900-6178918/ |title=Drawn to Life Review |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=January 14, 2016}}</ref>\n| GSpy_DS = {{Rating|3.5|5}}<ref>{{cite web |author=Stratton, Bryan |date=September 14, 2007 |url=http://ds.gamespy.com/nintendo-ds/drawn-to-life/820317p1.html |title=GameSpy: Drawn to Life |publisher=[[GameSpy]] |accessdate=January 14, 2016}}</ref>\n| GameZone_DS = 7.5/10<ref>{{cite web |author=Woodward, Stephen |date=September 26, 2007 |url=http://www.gamezone.com/reviews/drawn_to_life_nds_review |title=Drawn to Life - NDS - Review |publisher=GameZone |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081229170713/http://nds.gamezone.com/gzreviews/r32649.htm |archivedate=December 29, 2008 |url-status=live |accessdate=January 15, 2016}}</ref>\n| IGN_DS = 7.9/10<ref>{{cite web |author=Bozon, Mark |date=September 10, 2007 |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/09/10/drawn-to-life-review |title=Drawn to Life Review |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=January 14, 2016}}</ref>\n| NP_DS = 7.5/10<ref>{{cite journal |title=Drawn to Life Review |journal=Nintendo Power |volume=221 |date=November 2007 |page=105}}</ref>\n| MC_DS = 73/100<ref name=\"mcds\">{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/ds/drawn-to-life |title=Drawn to Life for DS Reviews |publisher=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=January 14, 2016}}</ref>\n| MC_iOS = 53/100<ref name=\"mcios\">{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/ios/drawn-to-life |title=Drawn to Life for iPhone/iPad Reviews |publisher=Metacritic |accessdate=January 14, 2016}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThe game received \"mixed or average reviews\" on both platforms according to video game [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]].<ref name=\"mcds\"/><ref name=\"mcios\"/> In Japan, ''[[Famitsu]]'' gave the DS version a score of three eights and one seven for a total of 31 out of 40.<ref name=\"fam\"/>\n\n===Awards===\nThe DS version of ''Drawn to Life'' was nominated for Outstanding Achievement in Story Development at the 11th [[Annual Interactive Achievement Awards]] along with ''[[BioShock]]'', ''[[Mass Effect (video game)|Mass Effect]]'' and ''[[Uncharted: Drake's Fortune]]'' during the [[D.I.C.E.

{"title_page": "Jack Woodford", "text_new": "{{other people|Woodford|Woodford_(disambiguation)#People}}\n'''Jack Woodford''' (1894&ndash;1971) was an American novelist and non-fiction writer, author of successful [[Pulp fiction (genre)|pulp]] novels and non-fiction of the 1930s and 1940s. He wrote unique books on writing and getting published. Most famously, Woodford authored ''[[Trial and error (book)|Trial and Error]]'' which caused something of a scandal at the time of publication because of its no-holds-barred insights into the publishing industry.\n\nBorn '''Josiah Pitts Woolfolk''', he also wrote under the name '''Jack Woolfolk'''. The pen name \"Jack Woodford\" was derived from the first name of a writer he admired ([[Jack Lait]], a writer for [[Hearst Corporation|Hearst Publications]]) and the county where his father was born ([[Woodford County, Kentucky]]). Other pen names include '''Gordon Sayre''', '''Sappho Henderson Britt''', and '''Howard Hogue Kennedy'''.\n\n== Life ==\n\nWoodford grew up in [[Chicago]] when the dominant form of transportation was horse-drawn carriage. He was raised in well-to-do circumstances by his grandmother Annette (of [[Wales|Welsh]] stock) whom he called \"Nettie\". Nettie was a practicing member of [[Christian Science]] but was unable to bring Jack into the fold. Despite his general hatred of organized religion, Woodford joined the [[Freemasonry]] organization and remained a lifelong member.\n\nHis father was a doctor who started a private practice in [[Sioux City, Iowa]], eventually moving it to Chicago. He later taught diagnosis at [[Rush Medical College]], before dying at the age of forty-nine, likely from [[mercury poisoning]]. [[Calomel]] ([[mercurous chloride]]) was a popular medicine at the time and one the doctor himself used to excess. Woodford, always physically vibrant, thought of his father as a hypochondriac.\n\nWoodford witnessed the ''[[Eastland]]'' disaster where the steamer ship rolled over in the Chicago River and killed 845 people. He gave a firsthand account to the Chicago newspaper the ''[[Chicago Herald-Examiner|Herald-Examiner]]'' and described the event in Chapter 21 of his autobiography.\n\nAmong the many famous contemporaries Woodford befriended, the most notable are [[H. L. Mencken]], writer/satirist [[James Branch Cabell]], novelist [[Sherwood Anderson]], composer [[George Antheil]], and poet [[Ezra Pound]]. Woodford wrote a piece that was published in Pound's early ''Exile'' magazine. He also accompanied [[Winston Churchill]] when the former Prime Minister visited [[New York City]].\n\nWoodford's only child from his marriage to Josephine Hutchings Woolfolk, Louella Woolfolk (who wrote under the pen name Louella Woodford) was also a published author who, at the age of 18, wrote a 273-page novel titled ''Maid Unafraid'' that was published in 1937 by Godwin. Woodford was married on November 20, 1916 to the 16-year-old Josephine Hutchings, and divorced 17 years later.\n\nWoodford founded Jack Woodford Press in the 1930s and the company's work was distributed by Citadel in the 1940s. The editors of the company in the 1940s were Allan Wilson and Aaron Moses (\"Moe\") Shapiro.\n\n== Selected bibliography ==\n\n'''Non-fiction'''\n\n* ''[[Trial and error (book)|Trial and Error]]'' (1933)\n* ''Plotting'' (also published as ''Plotting - How to Have A Brain Child'') (1939)  details numerous methods of creating plots for short stories, novels, and other works of fiction.\n* ''Why Write A Novel?''

He wrote unique books on writing and getting published. Most famously, Woodford authored ''[[Trial and error (book)|Trial and Error]]'' which caused something of a scandal at the time of publication because of its no-holds-barred insights into the publishing industry.\n\nBorn '''Josiah Pitts Woolfolk''', he also wrote under the name '''Jack Woolfolk'''. The pen name \"Jack Woodford\" was derived from the first name of a writer he admired ([[Jack Lait]], a writer for [[Hearst Corporation|Hearst Publications]]) and the county where his father was born ([[Woodford County, Kentucky]]). Other pen names include '''Gordon Sayre''', '''Sappho Henderson Britt''', and '''Howard Hogue Kennedy'''.\n\n== Life ==\n\nWoodford grew up in [[Chicago]] when the dominant form of transportation was horse-drawn carriage. He was raised in well-to-do circumstances by his grandmother Annette (of [[Wales|Welsh]] stock) whom he called \"Nettie\". Nettie was a practicing member of [[Christian Science]] but was unable to bring Jack into the fold. Despite his general hatred of organized religion, Woodford joined the [[Freemasonry]] organization and remained a lifelong member.\n\nHis father was a doctor who started a private practice in [[Sioux City, Iowa]], eventually moving it to Chicago. He later taught diagnosis at [[Rush Medical College]], before dying at the age of forty-nine, likely from [[mercury poisoning]]. [[Calomel]] ([[mercurous chloride]]) was a popular medicine at the time and one the doctor himself used to excess. Woodford, always physically vibrant, thought of his father as a hypochondriac.\n\nWoodford witnessed the ''[[Eastland]]'' disaster where the steamer ship rolled over in the Chicago River and killed 845 people. He gave a firsthand account to the Chicago newspaper the ''[[Chicago Herald-Examiner|Herald-Examiner]]'' and described the event in Chapter 21 of his autobiography.\n\nAmong the many famous contemporaries Woodford befriended, the most notable are [[H. L. Mencken]], writer/satirist [[James Branch Cabell]], novelist [[Sherwood Anderson]], composer [[George Antheil]], and poet [[Ezra Pound]]. Woodford wrote a piece that was published in Pound\u2019s early ''Exile'' magazine. He also accompanied [[Winston Churchill]] when the former Prime Minister visited [[New York City]].\n\nWoodford's only child from his marriage to Josephine Hutchings Woolfolk, Louella Woolfolk (who wrote under the pen name Louella Woodford) was also a published author who, at the age of 18, wrote a 273-page novel titled ''Maid Unafraid'' that was published in 1937 by Godwin. Woodford was married on November 20, 1916 to the 16-year-old Josephine Hutchings, and divorced 17 years later.\n\nWoodford founded Jack Woodford Press in the 1930s and the company's work was distributed by Citadel in the 1940s. The editors of the company in the 1940s were Allan Wilson and Aaron Moses (\"Moe\") Shapiro.\n\n== Selected bibliography ==\n\n'''Non-fiction'''\n\n* ''[[Trial and error (book)|Trial and Error]]'' (1933)\n* ''Plotting'' (also published as ''Plotting - How to Have A Brain Child'') (1939)  details numerous methods of creating plots for short stories, novels, and other works of fiction.\n* ''Why Write A Novel?''

Introduced on 22 June 2012 by producer [[Bryan Kirkwood (producer)|Bryan Kirkwood]], Joey is the estranged son of established character [[Derek Branning]] ([[Jamie Foreman]]) and the brother of [[Alice Branning]] ([[Jasmyn Banks]]). Joey was featured in storylines such as a problematic relationship with his father due to his absence in his life, and a relationship with his first cousin [[Lauren Branning]] ([[Jacqueline Jossa]]). Joey and Lauren's relationship was one of the prominent storylines featured throughout 2012 and 2013. He also had relationships with [[Lucy Beale]] ([[Hetti Bywater]]),  [[Whitney Dean]] ([[Shona McGarty]]) and [[Janine Butcher]] ([[Charlie Brooks]]).\n\nThe character is recognised as one of the sexiest males in the show's history, and Witts won \"Sexiest Male\" at the [[Inside Soap Awards]] as well as being nominated again at [[British Soap Awards#2013 winners|The British Soap Awards 2013]]. Witts also won \"Most Popular Newcomer\" at the [[National Television Awards]]. In October 2013, it was announced that Witts had decided to leave the show. The door was left open for a possible return for the character, and Joey left Albert Square to live with his mother on 26 December 2013.\n\n==Storylines==\nJoey arrives in [[Walford]] to persuade his sister, [[Alice Branning]] ([[Jasmyn Banks]]) to return home. However, [[Derek Branning]] ([[Jamie Foreman]]) is angered by Joey. He punches Derek and then reveals he is his son. He makes it clear he wants nothing to do with Derek. Later, he meets his cousin [[Lauren Branning]] ([[Jacqueline Jossa]]) and takes a liking to her friend [[Lucy Beale]] ([[Hetti Bywater]]). He tricks Derek into giving him money, which he gives to Lucy, as Derek has been stealing money from her. He tries to bring Alice home but she insists she is staying, and Joey accepts work from [[Michael Moon (EastEnders)|Michael Moon]] ([[Steve John Shepherd]]) as Derek does not like Michael. He then decides to show Alice what Derek is really like, so invites several friends to a family dinner, leading to Derek trying to punch Joey. However, Alice is just angry at Joey for ruining her day. He later helps Lucy when she is being pestered by someone, and they end up kissing. Joey manages to con Derek out of more money for Lucy, and she invites him to stay with her. When Derek gains ownership of the emporium, he gives it to Joey. He later kisses [[Whitney Dean]] ([[Shona McGarty]]), angering her. Joey's cousin, [[Lauren Branning]] ([[Jacqueline Jossa]]), notices that Whitney is unhappy around Joey, and Joey admits that he kissed Whitney. Lauren tells Joey he needs to tell Lucy but he insists it was just a kiss.\n\nLucy, Whitney and Lauren decide Joey needs to be taught a lesson so they get Lucy to call Joey to the park and then handcuff him to a gate and leave him, Lauren later returns and frees him but Joey says to her that she's jealous that he kissed Whitney and not her so Lauren slaps him and leaves. Joey later ends his relationship with Lucy, no longer having feelings for her. He later moves in with his uncle [[Max Branning]] ([[Jake Wood]]) much to Derek's dismay, he then begins a sexual relationship with his cousin Lauren, and they quickly fall in love, Derek finds them kissing and informs Joey, worried he will tell Max they attempt to run away, stealing Derek's car, Lauren had been drinking and crashes the car, Derek saves them, however Joey still has no feelings for him, Joey also takes the blame for the crash, but calls off his relationship with his cousin as Derek threatens to tell the police that Lauren was the real driver. Lauren's mother [[Tanya Branning|Tanya Cross]] ([[Jo Joyner]]) discovers the relationship and Derek blackmails her to force Joey to break up with Lauren.\n\nDerek dies of a heart attack, and Joey does not help him. Joey breaks down at the funeral, telling Alice it is his fault. [[Dot Cotton|Dot Branning]] ([[June Brown]]) finds Joey and Lauren making out on her sofa, and when Joey is introduced to her as Derek's son, she is horrified and reveals the relationship to the rest of the family. However, they continue their relationship with the approval of Lauren's parents. In a fit of jealousy, Lucy spikes Lauren's drink and Joey breaks up with Lauren, leaving her distraught. Lauren later leaves Walford with her mother and brother to go to a clinic to get over her alcoholism. When Lauren returns, she finds out that Joey had sex with Whitney. Joey and Lauren decide to still be friends, though Joey is jealous when he finds out that Lauren is seeing another man.\n\nJoey becomes increasingly concerned about his sister Alice, and the way she is involved in a bitter custody feud between Michael and his wife [[Janine Butcher]] ([[Charlie Brooks]]). After Alice is imprisoned for Michael's murder, she tells Joey that she only killed Michael to stop him killing Janine. Joey tries to get Janine to change her statement to confirm this, but Janine refuses, claiming Alice is a murderer. Later Joey tells Janine that he believes her and when Joey comforts Janine over her loss this leads to them having sex. Janine ends the relationship when she realises Joey is just trying to get her to admit she killed Michael and Alice did not. Alice pleads guilty to the murder but Janine is arrested after Joey gives the police a tape recording of Janine admitting that she killed Michael. Joey speaks to Alice's solicitor, who confirms she will not be released because of her plea. Having nothing to stay for, Joey leaves to live with his mother. He asks Lauren to come with him, admitting that he still loves her, but Lauren decides to stay.\n\n==Creation and development==\n===Introduction===\nThe character of Joey Branning and his casting was announced on 9 May 2012. David Witts was chosen to play Joey, the son of established character Derek Branning, played by Jamie Foreman. Speaking of his casting, Witts said, \"I am delighted to be joining EastEnders after being a fan for so many years. Joining the Branning family couldn't have come at a better time especially after the recent British Soap Award wins.\" Executive producer Lorraine Newman went on to say, \"Joey is a fantastic addition to the Branning family. After an explosive entrance onto the Square, he is set to break a few hearts as he campaigns to bring Derek down.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/eastenders/2012/05/joey.shtml|title=Say hello to Joey Branning|work=[[BBC News]]|date=10 May 2012|accessdate=28 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe character's arrival meant that Derek would have to \"face up to his past\", and that Joey was eager to show his sister, Alice, what her father was really like. Joey was billed as \"charming\" but also \"prides himself on telling it how it is, but is in fact a compulsive liar\". The character was also easily able to attract girls, but likes to make them feel as though they made the first move \u2013 even if he has nudged them into it.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/eastenders/a380842/eastenders-casts-derek-brannings-son-joey/|title=''EastEnders'' casts Derek Branning's son Joey|work=[[Digital Spy]]|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=9 May 2012|accessdate=28 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Characterisation===\nJoey has been described as \"Charming, good-looking, and a compulsive liar.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/rhqxspH5mj7yxR9h9hZlPt/joey-branning|title=BBC One \u2013 ''EastEnders'' \u2013 Joey Branning|accessdate=29 September 2019}}</ref> Upon being asked how he would describe his character, Witts commented, \"Joey is a great character to play. He's actually a weird one to describe, because he's so different to everyone that he comes into contact with! Obviously his relationship with Derek is going to be very volatile and there's a lot of resentment there. Joey can be very dark, too \u2013 not that he would admit it! [...] There are definitely some parallels between him and Derek, which are really interesting to explore. But there's a lot more to him than that, which is why I'm really enjoying portraying him. He's also a bit of a lothario, and when it comes to his family, he's very protective towards Alice. So depending on who you are when you meet Joey, you can get a number of different responses from him.\"<ref name = tease_interview>{{Cite news|url=https://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/eastenders/a388172/eastenders-david-witts-teases-joey-branning-role-interview/|title=''EastEnders'' David Witts teases Joey Branning role \u2013 interview|work=[[Digital Spy]]|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=18 June 2012|accessdate=28 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nVicky Prior of ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro News]]'' described Joey as an \"oddity\" in Albert Square.

But Joey defied genetics and arrived on screen to adulation worthy of a [[One Direction]] band member.\" Upon his exit in 2013, she said, \"While Joey will be remembered for his physique, he has been an excellent character, with just the right amount of hardman swagger to offset his sweeter, romantic side.\"<ref name = metro_leave />\n\nIn an interview with ''Digital Spy'' in 2013, Witts said, \"I think I've been really lucky to have some big, big storylines. A lot of characters come in and stay in the background for a long time, but with Joey, I was lucky enough to come in and really get some good stuff. I'm really pleased with the scenes I've done with Jacqueline [Jossa] and I was very proud of how it played out. Before the Joey and Lauren storyline started, I think people had heard about the 'kissing cousins' and had a lot of reservations about it. But I was really pleased to see that once Joey and Lauren's relationship ended after the car crash, people had changed their minds and said, 'Well actually, they're so good together that we want them to get back together!' I was also really pleased with the aftermath of Derek's death.

Joey then becomes quite protective over her, and that\u2019s quite attractive to him because he does like protecting people. Joey also knows that if he\u2019s going to be around Lucy, then it\u2019s going to annoy Derek!

It\u2019s not long before they\u2019re getting it on but Joey\u2019s mind is on Lauren and he tells Lucy he can\u2019t be with her because he is in love with someone else.

Daniel Kilkelly of ''Digital Spy'' said, \"Although Whitney is hoping to forget the mistake ever happened, Lauren convinces her that she should come clean with Lucy rather than deceiving her. Lucy struggles with the news of Joey's betrayal when Whitney confesses what happened, especially as she thought their relationship was getting serious.

Rachel Lucas of ''[[What's on TV]]'' explained, \"Determined to get the truth out of Janine, Joey corners her in the Vic, demanding she reveal what happened the night Michael died.

He revealed that he did not want to be an \"''EastEnders'' stalwart\", and would like to return to theatre later in his career. Witts elaborated: \"Not because there's anything wrong with it, but for me acting is a passion and it's about spreading yourself in different areas.\" He added pessimistically: \"I don't know if I'll still be at EastEnders in a year's time but I'll be more than happy if I am.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/eastenders/a452865/david-witts-i-dont-want-to-be-eastenders-stalwart/|title=David Witts: 'I don't want to be ''EastEnders'' stalwart'|work=[[Digital Spy]]|last=Millar|first=Paul|date=22 January 2013|accessdate=29 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn 20 October 2013, it was announced that Witts had decided to leave ''EastEnders'' as Joey Branning and would depart at Christmas.

An ''EastEnders'' spokesperson told the ''Daily Star'', \"We can confirm that David is leaving ''EastEnders'' later this year and we wish him all the best for the future.\" Speaking of his departure, Witts commented, \"They\u2019re leaving the door open for me, which I\u2019m really pleased about.\" He added, \"To be honest, it\u2019s not going to be a massive exit because when you have one of those it\u2019s then very hard for you to come back. So, it\u2019s a nice story that gets me there, but it\u2019s not going to be anything that people will be talking about for years to come!\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/eastenders/a524919/eastenders-david-witts-to-leave-joey-branning-role/|title=''EastEnders'' David Witts to leave Joey Branning role|work=[[Digital Spy]]|last=Brown|first=David|date=21 October 2013|accessdate=29 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nWitts told ''Radio Times'' \"It\u2019s been a really quiet year [...] There have been lots of scenes of me just walking into the caf\u00e9 and saying \u2018all right\u2019.

Joey was featured in storylines such as a problematic relationship with his father due to his absence in his life, and a relationship with his first cousin [[Lauren Branning]] ([[Jacqueline Jossa]]). Joey and Lauren's relationship was one of the prominent storylines featured throughout 2012 and 2013. He also had relationships with [[Lucy Beale]] ([[Hetti Bywater]]),  [[Whitney Dean]] ([[Shona McGarty]]) and [[Janine Butcher]] ([[Charlie Brooks]]).\n\nThe character is recognised as one of the sexiest males in the show's history, and Witts won \"Sexiest Male\" at the [[Inside Soap Awards]] as well as being nominated again at [[British Soap Awards#2013 winners|The British Soap Awards 2013]].

However, [[Derek Branning]] ([[Jamie Foreman]]) is angered by Joey. He punches Derek and then reveals he is his son. He makes it clear he wants nothing to do with Derek. Later, he meets his cousin [[Lauren Branning]] ([[Jacqueline Jossa]]) and takes a liking to her friend [[Lucy Beale]] ([[Hetti Bywater]]). He tricks Derek into giving him money, which he gives to Lucy, as Derek has been stealing money from her. He tries to bring Alice home but she insists she is staying, and Joey accepts work from [[Michael Moon (EastEnders)|Michael Moon]] ([[Steve John Shepherd]]) as Derek does not like Michael.

Joey manages to con Derek out of more money for Lucy, and she invites him to stay with her. When Derek gains ownership of the emporium, he gives it to Joey.

Lauren tells Joey he needs to tell Lucy but he insists it was just a kiss.\n\nLucy, Whitney and Lauren decide Joey needs to be taught a lesson so they get Lucy to call Joey to the park and then handcuff him to a gate and leave him, Lauren later returns and frees him but Joey says to her that she's jealous that he kissed Whitney and not her so Lauren slaps him and leaves. Joey later ends his relationship with Lucy, no longer having feelings for her. He later moves in with his uncle [[Max Branning]] ([[Jake Wood]]) much to Derek's dismay, he then begins a sexual relationship with his cousin Lauren, and they quickly fall in love, Derek finds them kissing and informs Joey, worried he will tell Max they attempt to run away, stealing Derek's car, Lauren had been drinking and crashes the car, Derek saves them, however Joey still has no feelings for him, Joey also takes the blame for the crash, but calls off his relationship with his cousin as Derek threatens to tell the police that Lauren was the real driver. Lauren's mother [[Tanya Branning|Tanya Cross]] ([[Jo Joyner]]) discovers the relationship and Derek blackmails her to force Joey to break up with Lauren.\n\nDerek dies of a heart attack, and Joey does not help him. Joey breaks down at the funeral, telling Alice it is his fault. [[Dot Cotton|Dot Branning]] ([[June Brown]]) finds Joey and Lauren making out on her sofa, and when Joey is introduced to her as Derek's son, she is horrified and reveals the relationship to the rest of the family. However, they continue their relationship with the approval of Lauren's parents. In a fit of jealousy, Lucy spikes Lauren's drink and Joey breaks up with Lauren, leaving her distraught. Lauren later leaves Walford with her mother and brother to go to a clinic to get over her alcoholism. When Lauren returns, she finds out that Joey had sex with Whitney. Joey and Lauren decide to still be friends, though Joey is jealous when he finds out that Lauren is seeing another man.\n\nJoey becomes increasingly concerned about his sister Alice, and the way she is involved in a bitter custody feud between Michael and his wife [[Janine Butcher]] ([[Charlie Brooks]]). After Alice is imprisoned for Michael's murder, she tells Joey that she only killed Michael to stop him killing Janine. Joey tries to get Janine to change her statement to confirm this, but Janine refuses, claiming Alice is a murderer. Later Joey tells Janine that he believes her and when Joey comforts Janine over her loss this leads to them having sex. Janine ends the relationship when she realises Joey is just trying to get her to admit she killed Michael and Alice did not. Alice pleads guilty to the murder but Janine is arrested after Joey gives the police a tape recording of Janine admitting that she killed Michael. Joey speaks to Alice's solicitor, who confirms she will not be released because of her plea. Having nothing to stay for, Joey leaves to live with his mother. He asks Lauren to come with him, admitting that he still loves her, but Lauren decides to stay.\n\n==Creation and development==\n===Introduction===\nThe character of Joey Branning and his casting was announced on 9 May 2012. David Witts was chosen to play Joey, the son of established character Derek Branning, played by Jamie Foreman. Speaking of his casting, Witts said, \"I am delighted to be joining EastEnders after being a fan for so many years. Joining the Branning family couldn't have come at a better time especially after the recent British Soap Award wins.\" Executive producer Lorraine Newman went on to say, \"Joey is a fantastic addition to the Branning family. After an explosive entrance onto the Square, he is set to break a few hearts as he campaigns to bring Derek down.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/eastenders/2012/05/joey.shtml|title=Say hello to Joey Branning|work=[[BBC News]]|date=10 May 2012|accessdate=28 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe character's arrival meant that Derek would have to \"face up to his past\", and that Joey was eager to show his sister, Alice, what her father was really like. Joey was billed as \"charming\" but also \"prides himself on telling it how it is, but is in fact a compulsive liar\". The character was also easily able to attract girls, but likes to make them feel as though they made the first move \u2013 even if he has nudged them into it.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/eastenders/a380842/eastenders-casts-derek-brannings-son-joey/|title=''EastEnders'' casts Derek Branning's son Joey|work=[[Digital Spy]]|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=9 May 2012|accessdate=28 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Characterisation===\nJoey has been described as \"Charming, good-looking, and a compulsive liar.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/rhqxspH5mj7yxR9h9hZlPt/joey-branning|title=BBC One \u2013 ''EastEnders'' \u2013 Joey Branning|accessdate=29 September 2019}}</ref> Upon being asked how he would describe his character, Witts commented, \"Joey is a great character to play. He's actually a weird one to describe, because he's so different to everyone that he comes into contact with! Obviously his relationship with Derek is going to be very volatile and there's a lot of resentment there. Joey can be very dark, too \u2013 not that he would admit it! [...] There are definitely some parallels between him and Derek, which are really interesting to explore. But there's a lot more to him than that, which is why I'm really enjoying portraying him. He's also a bit of a lothario, and when it comes to his family, he's very protective towards Alice. So depending on who you are when you meet Joey, you can get a number of different responses from him.\"<ref name = tease_interview>{{Cite news|url=https://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/eastenders/a388172/eastenders-david-witts-teases-joey-branning-role-interview/|title=''EastEnders'' David Witts teases Joey Branning role \u2013 interview|work=[[Digital Spy]]|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=18 June 2012|accessdate=28 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nVicky Prior of ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro News]]'' described Joey as an \"oddity\" in Albert Square. She added, \"His father resembled a frog auditioning for a film about the Krays. His Uncle Max is lanky, ginger and balding, yet still a devil with the ladies. But Joey defied genetics and arrived on screen to adulation worthy of a [[One Direction]] band member.\" Upon his exit in 2013, she said, \"While Joey will be remembered for his physique, he has been an excellent character, with just the right amount of hardman swagger to offset his sweeter, romantic side.\"<ref name = metro_leave />\n\nIn an interview with ''Digital Spy'' in 2013, Witts said, \"I think I've been really lucky to have some big, big storylines. A lot of characters come in and stay in the background for a long time, but with Joey, I was lucky enough to come in and really get some good stuff. I'm really pleased with the scenes I've done with Jacqueline [Jossa] and I was very proud of how it played out. Before the Joey and Lauren storyline started, I think people had heard about the 'kissing cousins' and had a lot of reservations about it. But I was really pleased to see that once Joey and Lauren's relationship ended after the car crash, people had changed their minds and said, 'Well actually, they're so good together that we want them to get back together!' I was also really pleased with the aftermath of Derek's death. It was nice to show a vulnerable side to Joey, which usually isn't there.\"<ref name = interview_future>{{Cite news|url=https://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/eastenders/a451596/eastenders-david-witts-talks-awards-joey-branning-future/|title=''EastEnders'' David Witts talks awards and Joey Branning future|work=[[Digital Spy]]|date=17 January 2013|accessdate=29 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Relationship with Lauren Branning===\nIn September 2012, a storyline surfaced where Lauren Branning would fall for her cousin, Joey.

If Joey takes either of those options, Derek won't tell the police that Lauren was driving the car. Joey's love for Lauren is massive, but not quite as massive as his hatred for Derek. He decides to become the villain and lie that he never loved her.

Witts commented, \"When Joey joins the Square, he finds out very quickly that Derek is being a real git to Lucy. Joey then becomes quite protective over her, and that\u2019s quite attractive to him because he does like protecting people. Joey also knows that if he\u2019s going to be around Lucy, then it\u2019s going to annoy Derek! [...] On top of all that, there will be a slight attraction between Joey and Lucy, as he can see that she\u2019s a pretty girl.

As a result, Lauren is heartbroken and extremely jealous. An ''EastEnders'' insider \"\u201cLucy is smitten with Joey and is more than up for taking him back to her place. As you can imagine, Lauren is devastated. She\u2019s really fallen for him and can\u2019t believe how cruel he is being. She leaves and he ends up going home with Lucy. It\u2019s not long before they\u2019re getting it on but Joey\u2019s mind is on Lauren and he tells Lucy he can\u2019t be with her because he is in love with someone else. Lucy has no idea about Lauren and Joey but she is certainly going to do everything she can to find out who his mystery love interest is.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.dailystar.co.uk/tv/eastenders-joe-cool-hot-lucy-18573728|title=''EastEnders'' Joey's cool on hot Lucy lust|work=[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]|last=Hill|first=Susan|date=25 November 2012|accessdate=29 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhilst Joey and Lucy are dating, he betrays her by kissing Whitney Dean. When Whitney informs Lauren about the kiss, she persuades her to tell Lucy. Daniel Kilkelly of ''Digital Spy'' said, \"Although Whitney is hoping to forget the mistake ever happened, Lauren convinces her that she should come clean with Lucy rather than deceiving her. Lucy struggles with the news of Joey's betrayal when Whitney confesses what happened, especially as she thought their relationship was getting serious.

Rachel Lucas of ''[[What's on TV]]'' explained, \"Determined to get the truth out of Janine, Joey corners her in the Vic, demanding she reveal what happened the night Michael died.

He revealed that he did not want to be an \"''EastEnders'' stalwart\", and would like to return to theatre later in his career. Witts elaborated: \"Not because there's anything wrong with it, but for me acting is a passion and it's about spreading yourself in different areas.\" He added pessimistically: \"I don't know if I'll still be at EastEnders in a year's time but I'll be more than happy if I am.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/eastenders/a452865/david-witts-i-dont-want-to-be-eastenders-stalwart/|title=David Witts: 'I don't want to be ''EastEnders'' stalwart'|work=[[Digital Spy]]|last=Millar|first=Paul|date=22 January 2013|accessdate=29 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn 20 October 2013, it was announced that Witts had decided to leave ''EastEnders'' as Joey Branning and would depart at Christmas.

An ''EastEnders'' spokesperson told the ''Daily Star'', \"We can confirm that David is leaving ''EastEnders'' later this year and we wish him all the best for the future.\" Speaking of his departure, Witts commented, \"They\u2019re leaving the door open for me, which I\u2019m really pleased about.\" He added, \"To be honest, it\u2019s not going to be a massive exit because when you have one of those it\u2019s then very hard for you to come back.

He told ''Digital Spy'', \"I look back on it now with such fondness. At the time, it all came and went in such a blur. Because first of all, I was terrified all the time. I spent a year and a half scared. I eventually learned how to navigate that world, but the soap world is unlike anything you'll ever see, really. It's very specific within the industry [...] I'm so proud of doing the work on there and having that little bit of success. But I guess at the time, it was just a crazy whirlwind.

The game begins 15 years after ''[[Dying Light]]'', starring a new protagonist named Aiden Caldwell, who is equipped with various [[parkour]] skills. Players can perform actions such as climbing ledges, sliding, leaping off from edges, and wall running to quickly navigate the city. More than double the [[parkour]] moves have been added since the first game, some are exclusive to particular areas of the city. Tools such as a [[grappling hook]] and a [[paraglider]] also aid transversal in the city. Aiden can also use the undead to break his fall. The game is mostly melee-based with the majority of fighting using melee weapons. The melee weapons have a limited lifespan and will degrade the longer the player uses the melee weapons in combat.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.destructoid.com/dying-light-2-lets-you-destroy-entire-areas-in-the-city-557392.phtml|title=Dying Light 2 lets you destroy entire areas in the city|first=Darren|last=Nakamura|work=[[Destructoid]]|date=June 20, 2019|accessdate=June 25, 2019}}</ref> Long-range weapons such as [[crossbows]], [[shotguns]], [[spears]], can be used as well.

He has been called the \"most influential creator of gay pornographic images\" by cultural historian Joseph W. Slade.<ref name=\"PASR\">Slade, Joseph W.: [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZaGTZySRzeYC Pornography and Sexual Representation: A Reference Guide, Volume 2.] Pp. 545\u2013546. Greenwood Publishing Group, 2001. {{ISBN|0-313-27568-8}}</ref> Over the course of four decades, he produced some 3,500 illustrations, mostly featuring men with exaggerated [[Sex organ|primary]] and [[Secondary sex characteristic|secondary sex traits]], wearing tight or partially removed clothing.\n\n==Early life==\nLaaksonen was born on 8 May 1920 and raised by a middle-class family in [[Kaarina]], a town in southwestern [[Finland]], near the city of [[Turku]].<ref name=\"L\u00f6fstr\u00f6m, pp. 189\">L\u00f6fstr\u00f6m, pp. 189.</ref> Both of his parents Suoma and Edwin Laaksonen were schoolteachers at the grammar school that served Kaarina. The family lived in the school building's attached living quarters.<ref>Hooven 1993, p. 3.</ref>\n\nHe went to school in Turku and in 1939, at the age of 19, he moved to [[Helsinki]] to study advertising. In his spare time he also started drawing erotic images for his own pleasure,<ref name=\"L\u00f6fstr\u00f6m, pp. 189\"/> based on images of male laborers he had seen from an early age. At first he kept these drawings hidden, but then destroyed them \"at least by the time I went to serve the army.\"<ref>Arell & Mustola, p. 15.</ref> The country became embroiled in the [[Winter War]] with the [[USSR]], and then became formally involved in [[World War II]], and he was conscripted in February 1940 into the [[Finnish Army]].<ref name=\"L\u00f6fstr\u00f6m, pp. 189\"/> He served as an anti-aircraft officer, holding the rank of second lieutenant.<ref name=\"Tom of Finland: A Short Biography\">{{cite web |url=https://www.tomoffinlandfoundation.org/foundation/touko.html |title=Tom of Finland: A Short Biography |website=Tom of Finland Foundation |access-date=6 March 2017}}</ref> He later attributed his fetishistic interest in uniformed men to encounters with men in army uniform, especially soldiers of the German [[Wehrmacht]] serving in Finland at that time. \"In my drawings I have no political statements to make, no ideology. I am thinking only about the picture itself. The whole [[Nazi]] philosophy, the racism and all that, is hateful to me, but of course I drew them anyway\u2014they had the sexiest uniforms!\"<ref name=Valentine>Hooven 1993, p. 30.</ref> After the war, in 1945, he returned to studies.<ref name=\"L\u00f6fstr\u00f6m, pp. 189\"/>\n\nLaaksonen's artwork of this period compared to later works is considered more romantic and softer with \"gentle-featured shapes and forms.\"<ref name=\"L\u00f6fstr\u00f6m, pp. 189\"/> The men featured were middle class, as opposed to the sailors, bikers, lumberjacks, construction workers, and other members of stereotypically hypermasculine working class groups that feature in his later work.<ref name=\"L\u00f6fstr\u00f6m, pp. 189\"/> Another key difference is the lack of dramatic compositions, self-assertive poses, muscular bodies and \"detached exotic settings\" that his later work embodied.<ref name=\"L\u00f6fstr\u00f6m, pp. 189\"/>\n\n==Career==\nIn 1956 Laaksonen submitted drawings to the influential American magazine ''[[Physique Pictorial]]'', which premiered the images in the 1957 Spring issue under the pseudonym ''Tom'', as it resembled his given name ''Touko''. In the Winter issue later that year, editor [[Bob Mizer]] coined the credit ''Tom of Finland''.<ref>Arell & Mustola, p. 31. This followed the naming conventions of the magazine. Other pseudonyms of the time were ''Bruce of Los Angeles'' and ''Spartan of Hollywood'', for example.</ref> One of his pieces was featured on the Spring 1957 cover, depicting two [[lumberjack|log drivers]] at work with a third man watching them.<ref name=\"L\u00f6fstr\u00f6m, pp. 189\"/> Pulled from the Finnish mythology of lumberjacks representing strong masculinity, Laaksonen emphasized and privileged \"[[homoerotic]] potentiality [...] relocating it in a gay context\", a strategy repeated throughout his career.<ref name=\"L\u00f6fstr\u00f6m, pp. 189\"/>\n\nThe post-World War II era saw the rise of the biker culture as rejecting \"the reorganization and normalization of life after the war, with its conformist, settled lifestyle.\"<ref name=\"L\u00f6fstr\u00f6m, pp. 190\">L\u00f6fstr\u00f6m, p. 190.</ref><ref>Su\u00e1rez, 1996, pp. 150.</ref> Biker subculture was both marginal and oppositional and provided postwar gay men with a stylized masculinity that included rebelliousness and danger.<ref name=\"L\u00f6fstr\u00f6m, pp. 190\"/> This was in contrast to the then-prevailing stereotypes of gay man as an effeminate [[sissy]], as seen in [[vaudeville]] and films going back to the first years of the industry.<ref>''[[The Celluloid Closet]]''; Directors:  Rob Epstein, Jeffrey Friedman (1996) UPC: 043396821071.</ref> Laaksonen was influenced by images of bikers as well as artwork of [[George Quaintance]] and [[Dom Orejudos|Etienne]], among others, that he cited as his precursors, \"disseminated to gay readership through homoerotic physique magazines\" starting in 1950.<ref>Hooven 1993, pp. 84\u201385.</ref><ref name=\"L\u00f6fstr\u00f6m, pp. 190\"/> Laaksonen's drawings of bikers and [[Leather subculture|leathermen]] capitalized on the leather and denim outfits which differentiated those men from mainstream culture and suggested they were untamed, physical, and self-empowered.<ref>Su\u00e1rez, 1996, pp. 152, 158.</ref><ref name=\"L\u00f6fstr\u00f6m, pp. 190-1\">L\u00f6fstr\u00f6m, pp. 190\u20131.</ref> This in contrast with the mainstream, medical and psychological sad and sensitive young gay man who is passive.<ref name=\"L\u00f6fstr\u00f6m, pp. 190-1\"/><ref>Su\u00e1rez, 1996, pp. 152, 158.; Dyer 1983</ref> Laaksonen's drawings of this time \"can be seen as consolidating an array of factors, styles and discourses already existing in the 1950s gay subcultures,\" this may have led to them being widely distributed and popularized within those cultures.<ref name=\"L\u00f6fstr\u00f6m, pp. 191\">L\u00f6fstr\u00f6m, pp. 191.</ref>\n\n=== U.S. censorship codes (1950s\u20131960s) ===\n[[File:Tom-of-Finland bio cover.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Tom of Finland: Life and Work of a Gay Hero | Cover of the ''Tom of Finland: Life and Work of a Gay Hero'' book.]]\nLaaksonen's style and content in the late 1950s and early 1960s was partly influenced by the U.S. censorship codes that restricted depiction of \"overt homosexual acts\".<ref name=\"L\u00f6fstr\u00f6m, pp. 191\"/> His work was published in the [[beefcake magazines|beefcake]] genre that began in the 1930s and predominantly featured photographs of attractive, muscular young men in athletic poses often shown demonstrating exercises.<ref name=\"beef\">''Beefcake'' (1999); Thom Fitzgerald, writer, director, co-producer; Shandi Mitchell, co-producer; Alliance Independent Films.</ref> Their primary market was gay men, but because of the conservative and [[homophobia|homophobic]] social culture of the era, [[gay pornography]] was illegal and the publications were typically presented as dedicated to physical fitness and health.<ref name=\"beef\"/> They were often the only connection that [[closeted]] men had to their sexuality.<ref name=\"beef\"/> By this time, however, Laaksonen was rendering private commissions, so more explicit work was produced but remained unpublished.<ref name=\"L\u00f6fstr\u00f6m, pp. 191\" />\n\nIn the 1962 case of ''[[MANual Enterprises v.

By 1973, he was publishing erotic comic books and making inroads to the mainstream art world with exhibitions. In 1973 he gave up his full-time job at the Helsinki office of [[McCann-Erickson]], an international advertising firm. \"Since then I've lived in jeans and lived on my drawings,\" is how he described the lifestyle transition which occurred during this period.\n\nBy the mid-1970s he was also emphasizing a [[photorealism|photorealistic]] style, making aspects of the drawings appear more photographic.<ref name=\"L\u00f6fstr\u00f6m, pp. 191\"/> Many of his drawings are based on photographs, but none are exact reproductions of them.<ref name=\"DATMA\">Ilppo Pohjola (author): Kari Paljakka and Alvaro Pardo (producers): Daddy and the Muscle Academy: Tom of Finland: United Kingdom: Oracle Home Entertainment: 2002.</ref>  The photographic inspiration is used, on the one hand, to create lifelike, almost moving images, with convincing and active postures and gestures while Laaksonen exaggerates physical features and presents his ideal of masculine beauty and sexual allure, combining realism with fantasy.<ref name=\"DATMA\"/> In ''Daddy and the Muscle Academy \u2013 The Art, Life, and Times of Tom of Finland'' examples of photographs and the drawings based upon them are shown side by side.<ref name=\"DATMA\"/> Although he considered the photographs to be merely reference tools for his drawings, contemporary art students have seen them as complete works of art that stand on their own.<ref>Hooven 2012, p. 134.</ref>\n\n[[File:TomsRoom-C11.jpg|thumb|right|Tom of Finland's room at the Tom of Finland Foundation's house in Los Angeles, 2002; photographed by [[Henning von Berg]].]]\nIn 1979, Laaksonen, with businessman and friend Durk Dehner, co-founded the Tom of Finland Company to preserve the copyright on his art, which had been widely pirated. In 1984 the Tom of Finland [[Foundation (charity)|Foundation]] was established to collect, preserve, and exhibit [[homoerotic]] artwork.<ref name=\"EGLPC\">Prono, Luca: [https://books.google.com/books?id=uID5xunun2wC Encyclopedia of Gay and Lesbian Popular Culture.] P. 258. Greenwood Publishing Group, 2008. {{ISBN|978-0-313-33599-0}}</ref> Although Laaksonen was quite successful at this point, with his biography on the best-seller list, and [[Benedikt Taschen]], the world's largest art book publisher reprinting and expanding a monograph of his works, he was most proud of the Foundation.<ref name=\"Ency of LG\" /> The scope of the organization expanded to erotic works of all types, sponsored contests, exhibits, and started the groundwork for a museum of erotic art.<ref name=\"Ency of LG\" />\n\nLaaksonen was diagnosed with [[emphysema]] in 1988. Eventually the disease and medication caused his hands to tremble, leading him to switch mediums from pencil to pastels. He died in 1991 of an emphysema-induced stroke.<ref name=\"Tom of Finland: A Short Biography\" />\n\n==Reception==\nDuring his lifetime and beyond, Laaksonen's work has drawn both admiration and disdain from different quarters of the artistic community. Laaksonen developed a friendship with gay photographer [[Robert Mapplethorpe]], whose work depicting [[sado-masochism]] and [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]] [[iconography]] was also subject to controversy.\n\nA controversial theme in his drawings was the erotic treatment of men in [[SS uniform|Nazi uniforms]]. They form a small part of his overall work, but the typically flattering visual treatment of these characters has led some viewers to infer sympathy or affinity for Nazism, and they have been omitted from most recent anthologies of his work. Later in his career Laaksonen disavowed this work and was at pains to dissociate himself and his work from fascist or racist ideologies. He also depicted a significant number of black men in his drawings, with no overt racial or political message in the context in which they appear; although they bear some commonality with racist [[caricature]]s of the \"hypersexual\" black male, these traits are shared by Laaksonen's white characters as well.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nArt critics have mixed views about Laaksonen's work. His detailed drawing technique has led to him being described as a \"master with a pencil\", while in contrast a reviewer for Dutch newspaper [[Het Parool]] described his work as \"illustrative but without expressivity\".<ref>''The Queer Encyclopedia Of The Visual Arts'', Claude J. Summers, Cleis Press, 2004. {{ISBN|1-57344-191-0}}</ref>\n\nThere is considerable argument over whether his depiction of \"supermen\" (male characters with huge sexual organs and muscles) is facile and distasteful, or whether there is a deeper complexity in the work which plays with and subverts those stereotypes.  For example, some critics have noted instances of apparent tenderness between traditionally tough, masculine characters, or playful smiles in sado-masochistic scenes.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nIn either case, there remains a large constituency who admire the work on a purely utilitarian basis; as described by Rob Meijer, owner of a leathershop and art gallery in Amsterdam, \"These works are not conversation pieces, they're masturbation pieces.\"{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nWriting for ''[[Artforum]]'', Kevin Killian said that seeing Tom of Finland originals \u201cproduces a strong respect for his nimble, witty creation\u201d.<ref>\u201cBob Mizer and Tom of Finland\u201d, Kevin Killian, ''Artforum International Magazine'', March 2014</ref> Kate Wolf writes that \u201cTom of Finland helped pave the way to gay liberation\u201d.<ref>\u201cBob Mizer and Tom of Finland\u201d, Kate Wolf, ''Artforum International Magazine'' (Online), November 21, 2013</ref>\n\n==Cultural impact and legacy==\n[[Image:DaddyandTheMuscle.jpg|thumb|upright|Cover of a video release of ''Daddy and the Muscle Academy: The Life and Art of Tom of Finland'' documentary.]]\nIn the late 1980s, artist [[G. B. Jones]] began a series of drawings called the \"Tom Girls\" that appropriated Tom of Finland's drawings. The drawings were done in the style of Tom of Finland and based on his drawings, but featured punk girls or other subculturally identified women. However, unlike Tom's drawings, in Jones' work the authority figures exist only to be undermined, not obeyed. The two artists exhibited their work together in New York City in the early 1990s.\n\nIn 1995, Tom of Finland Clothing Company introduced a fashion line based on his works, which covers a wide array of looks besides the typified cutoff-jeans-and-jacket style of his drawings. The fashion line balances the original [[homoeroticism]] of the drawings with mainstream fashion culture, and their runway shows occur in many of the venues during the same times as other fashion companies.{{cn|date=September 2014}}\n\nIn 2009, Tom was inducted into the Leather Hall of Fame.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://leatherhalloffame.com/index.php/inductees.html |title=> Inductees |publisher=Leatherhalloffame.com |date= |accessdate=2019-12-31}}</ref>\n\nOriginal works by Laaksonen are at the [[Leather Archives and Museum]].\n\n===Exhibitions===\nNew York's [[Museum of Modern Art]] has acquired several examples of Laaksonen's artwork for its permanent collection.<ref>Arell & Mustola, p. 187</ref> In 2006, MoMA in New York accepted five Tom of Finland drawings as part of a much larger gift from The Judith Rothschild Foundation.

He has been called the \"most influential creator of gay pornographic images\" by cultural historian Joseph W. Slade.<ref name=\"PASR\">Slade, Joseph W.: [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZaGTZySRzeYC Pornography and Sexual Representation: A Reference Guide, Volume 2.] Pp. 545\u2013546.

The family lived in the school building's attached living quarters.<ref>Hooven 1993, p. 3.</ref>\n\nHe went to school in Turku and in 1939, at the age of 19, he moved to [[Helsinki]] to study advertising. In his spare time he also started drawing erotic images for his own pleasure,<ref name=\"L\u00f6fstr\u00f6m, pp. 189\"/> based on images of male laborers he had seen from an early age. At first he kept these drawings hidden, but then destroyed them \"at least by the time I went to serve the army.\"<ref>Arell & Mustola, p. 15.</ref> The country became embroiled in the [[Winter War]] with the [[USSR]], and then became formally involved in [[World War II]], and he was conscripted in February 1940 into the [[Finnish Army]].<ref name=\"L\u00f6fstr\u00f6m, pp. 189\"/> He served as an anti-aircraft officer, holding the rank of second lieutenant.<ref name=\"Tom of Finland: A Short Biography\">{{cite web |url=https://www.tomoffinlandfoundation.org/foundation/touko.html |title=Tom of Finland: A Short Biography |website=Tom of Finland Foundation |access-date=6 March 2017}}</ref> He later attributed his fetishistic interest in uniformed men to encounters with men in army uniform, especially soldiers of the German [[Wehrmacht]] serving in Finland at that time. \"In my drawings I have no political statements to make, no ideology. I am thinking only about the picture itself. The whole [[Nazi]] philosophy, the racism and all that, is hateful to me, but of course I drew them anyway\u2014they had the sexiest uniforms!\"<ref name=Valentine>Hooven 1993, p. 30.</ref> After the war, in 1945, he returned to studies.<ref name=\"L\u00f6fstr\u00f6m, pp. 189\"/>\n\nLaaksonen's artwork of this period compared to later works is considered more romantic and softer with \"gentle-featured shapes and forms.\"<ref name=\"L\u00f6fstr\u00f6m, pp. 189\"/> The men featured were middle class, as opposed to the sailors, bikers, lumberjacks, construction workers, and other members of stereotypically hypermasculine working class groups that feature in his later work.<ref name=\"L\u00f6fstr\u00f6m, pp. 189\"/> Another key difference is the lack of dramatic compositions, self-assertive poses, muscular bodies and \"detached exotic settings\" that his later work embodied.<ref name=\"L\u00f6fstr\u00f6m, pp. 189\"/>\n\n==Career==\nIn 1956 Laaksonen submitted drawings to the influential American magazine ''[[Physique Pictorial]]'', which premiered the images in the 1957 Spring issue under the pseudonym ''Tom'', as it resembled his given name ''Touko''. In the Winter issue later that year, editor [[Bob Mizer]] coined the credit ''Tom of Finland''.<ref>Arell & Mustola, p. 31. This followed the naming conventions of the magazine. Other pseudonyms of the time were ''Bruce of Los Angeles'' and ''Spartan of Hollywood'', for example.</ref> One of his pieces was featured on the Spring 1957 cover, depicting two [[lumberjack|log drivers]] at work with a third man watching them.<ref name=\"L\u00f6fstr\u00f6m, pp. 189\"/> Pulled from the Finnish mythology of lumberjacks representing strong masculinity, Laaksonen emphasized and privileged \"[[homoerotic]] potentiality [...] relocating it in a gay context\", a strategy repeated throughout his career.<ref name=\"L\u00f6fstr\u00f6m, pp. 189\"/>\n\nThe post-World War II era saw the rise of the biker culture as rejecting \"the reorganization and normalization of life after the war, with its conformist, settled lifestyle.\"<ref name=\"L\u00f6fstr\u00f6m, pp. 190\">L\u00f6fstr\u00f6m, p. 190.</ref><ref>Su\u00e1rez, 1996, pp. 150.</ref> Biker subculture was both marginal and oppositional and provided postwar gay men with a stylized masculinity that included rebelliousness and danger.<ref name=\"L\u00f6fstr\u00f6m, pp. 190\"/> This was in contrast to the then-prevailing stereotypes of gay man as an effeminate [[sissy]], as seen in [[vaudeville]] and films going back to the first years of the industry.<ref>''[[The Celluloid Closet]]''; Directors:  Rob Epstein, Jeffrey Friedman (1996) UPC: 043396821071.</ref> Laaksonen was influenced by images of bikers as well as artwork of [[George Quaintance]] and [[Dom Orejudos|Etienne]], among others, that he cited as his precursors, \"disseminated to gay readership through homoerotic physique magazines\" starting in 1950.<ref>Hooven 1993, pp. 84\u201385.</ref><ref name=\"L\u00f6fstr\u00f6m, pp. 190\"/> Laaksonen's drawings of bikers and [[Leather subculture|leathermen]] capitalized on the leather and denim outfits which differentiated those men from mainstream culture and suggested they were untamed, physical, and self-empowered.<ref>Su\u00e1rez, 1996, pp. 152, 158.</ref><ref name=\"L\u00f6fstr\u00f6m, pp. 190-1\">L\u00f6fstr\u00f6m, pp. 190\u20131.</ref> This in contrast with the mainstream, medical and psychological sad and sensitive young gay man who is passive.<ref name=\"L\u00f6fstr\u00f6m, pp. 190-1\"/><ref>Su\u00e1rez, 1996, pp. 152, 158.; Dyer 1983</ref> Laaksonen's drawings of this time \"can be seen as consolidating an array of factors, styles and discourses already existing in the 1950s gay subcultures,\" this may have led to them being widely distributed and popularized within those cultures.<ref name=\"L\u00f6fstr\u00f6m, pp. 191\">L\u00f6fstr\u00f6m, pp. 191.</ref>\n\n=== U.S. censorship codes (1950s\u20131960s) ===\n[[File:Tom-of-Finland bio cover.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Tom of Finland: Life and Work of a Gay Hero | Cover of the ''Tom of Finland: Life and Work of a Gay Hero'' book.]]\nLaaksonen's style and content in the late 1950s and early 1960s was partly influenced by the U.S. censorship codes that restricted depiction of \"overt homosexual acts\".<ref name=\"L\u00f6fstr\u00f6m, pp. 191\"/> His work was published in the [[beefcake magazines|beefcake]] genre that began in the 1930s and predominantly featured photographs of attractive, muscular young men in athletic poses often shown demonstrating exercises.<ref name=\"beef\">''Beefcake'' (1999); Thom Fitzgerald, writer, director, co-producer; Shandi Mitchell, co-producer; Alliance Independent Films.</ref> Their primary market was gay men, but because of the conservative and [[homophobia|homophobic]] social culture of the era, [[gay pornography]] was illegal and the publications were typically presented as dedicated to physical fitness and health.<ref name=\"beef\"/> They were often the only connection that [[closeted]] men had to their sexuality.<ref name=\"beef\"/> By this time, however, Laaksonen was rendering private commissions, so more explicit work was produced but remained unpublished.<ref name=\"L\u00f6fstr\u00f6m, pp. 191\" />\n\nIn the 1962 case of ''[[MANual Enterprises v.

By 1973, he was publishing erotic comic books and making inroads to the mainstream art world with exhibitions. In 1973 he gave up his full-time job at the Helsinki office of [[McCann-Erickson]], an international advertising firm. \"Since then I've lived in jeans and lived on my drawings,\" is how he described the lifestyle transition which occurred during this period.\n\nBy the mid-1970s he was also emphasizing a [[photorealism|photorealistic]] style, making aspects of the drawings appear more photographic.<ref name=\"L\u00f6fstr\u00f6m, pp. 191\"/> Many of his drawings are based on photographs, but none are exact reproductions of them.<ref name=\"DATMA\">Ilppo Pohjola (author): Kari Paljakka and Alvaro Pardo (producers): Daddy and the Muscle Academy: Tom of Finland: United Kingdom: Oracle Home Entertainment: 2002.</ref>  The photographic inspiration is used, on the one hand, to create lifelike, almost moving images, with convincing and active postures and gestures while Laaksonen exaggerates physical features and presents his ideal of masculine beauty and sexual allure, combining realism with fantasy.<ref name=\"DATMA\"/> In ''Daddy and the Muscle Academy \u2013 The Art, Life, and Times of Tom of Finland'' examples of photographs and the drawings based upon them are shown side by side.<ref name=\"DATMA\"/> Although he considered the photographs to be merely reference tools for his drawings, contemporary art students have seen them as complete works of art that stand on their own.<ref>Hooven 2012, p. 134.</ref>\n\n[[File:TomsRoom-C11.jpg|thumb|right|Tom of Finland's room at the Tom of Finland Foundation's house in Los Angeles, 2002; photographed by [[Henning von Berg]].]]\nIn 1979, Laaksonen, with businessman and friend Durk Dehner, co-founded the Tom of Finland Company to preserve the copyright on his art, which had been widely pirated. In 1984 the Tom of Finland [[Foundation (charity)|Foundation]] was established to collect, preserve, and exhibit [[homoerotic]] artwork.<ref name=\"EGLPC\">Prono, Luca: [https://books.google.com/books?id=uID5xunun2wC Encyclopedia of Gay and Lesbian Popular Culture.] P. 258. Greenwood Publishing Group, 2008. {{ISBN|978-0-313-33599-0}}</ref> Although Laaksonen was quite successful at this point, with his biography on the best-seller list, and [[Benedikt Taschen]], the world's largest art book publisher reprinting and expanding a monograph of his works, he was most proud of the Foundation.<ref name=\"Ency of LG\" /> The scope of the organization expanded to erotic works of all types, sponsored contests, exhibits, and started the groundwork for a museum of erotic art.<ref name=\"Ency of LG\" />\n\nLaaksonen was diagnosed with [[emphysema]] in 1988. Eventually the disease and medication caused his hands to tremble, leading him to switch mediums from pencil to pastels. He died in 1991 of an emphysema-induced stroke.<ref name=\"Tom of Finland: A Short Biography\" />\n\n==Reception==\nDuring his lifetime and beyond, Laaksonen's work has drawn both admiration and disdain from different quarters of the artistic community. Laaksonen developed a friendship with gay photographer [[Robert Mapplethorpe]], whose work depicting [[sado-masochism]] and [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]] [[iconography]] was also subject to controversy.\n\nA controversial theme in his drawings was the erotic treatment of men in [[SS uniform|Nazi uniforms]]. They form a small part of his overall work, but the typically flattering visual treatment of these characters has led some viewers to infer sympathy or affinity for Nazism, and they have been omitted from most recent anthologies of his work. Later in his career Laaksonen disavowed this work and was at pains to dissociate himself and his work from fascist or racist ideologies. He also depicted a significant number of black men in his drawings, with no overt racial or political message in the context in which they appear; although they bear some commonality with racist [[caricature]]s of the \"hypersexual\" black male, these traits are shared by Laaksonen's white characters as well.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nArt critics have mixed views about Laaksonen's work. His detailed drawing technique has led to him being described as a \"master with a pencil\", while in contrast a reviewer for Dutch newspaper [[Het Parool]] described his work as \"illustrative but without expressivity\".<ref>''The Queer Encyclopedia Of The Visual Arts'', Claude J. Summers, Cleis Press, 2004. {{ISBN|1-57344-191-0}}</ref>\n\nThere is considerable argument over whether his depiction of \"supermen\" (male characters with huge sexual organs and muscles) is facile and distasteful, or whether there is a deeper complexity in the work which plays with and subverts those stereotypes.  For example, some critics have noted instances of apparent tenderness between traditionally tough, masculine characters, or playful smiles in sado-masochistic scenes.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nIn either case, there remains a large constituency who admire the work on a purely utilitarian basis; as described by Rob Meijer, owner of a leathershop and art gallery in Amsterdam, \"These works are not conversation pieces, they're masturbation pieces.\"{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nWriting for ''[[Artforum]]'', Kevin Killian said that seeing Tom of Finland originals \u201cproduces a strong respect for his nimble, witty creation\u201d.<ref>\u201cBob Mizer and Tom of Finland\u201d, Kevin Killian, ''Artforum International Magazine'', March 2014</ref> Kate Wolf writes that \u201cTom of Finland helped pave the way to gay liberation\u201d.<ref>\u201cBob Mizer and Tom of Finland\u201d, Kate Wolf, ''Artforum International Magazine'' (Online), November 21, 2013</ref>\n\n==Cultural impact and legacy==\n[[Image:DaddyandTheMuscle.jpg|thumb|upright|Cover of a video release of ''Daddy and the Muscle Academy: The Life and Art of Tom of Finland'' documentary.]]\nIn the late 1980s, artist [[G. B. Jones]] began a series of drawings called the \"Tom Girls\" that appropriated Tom of Finland's drawings. The drawings were done in the style of Tom of Finland and based on his drawings, but featured punk girls or other subculturally identified women. However, unlike Tom's drawings, in Jones' work the authority figures exist only to be undermined, not obeyed. The two artists exhibited their work together in New York City in the early 1990s.\n\nIn 1995, Tom of Finland Clothing Company introduced a fashion line based on his works, which covers a wide array of looks besides the typified cutoff-jeans-and-jacket style of his drawings. The fashion line balances the original [[homoeroticism]] of the drawings with mainstream fashion culture, and their runway shows occur in many of the venues during the same times as other fashion companies.{{cn|date=September 2014}}\n\nIn 2009, Tom was inducted into the Leather Hall of Fame.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://leatherhalloffame.com/index.php/inductees.html |title=> Inductees |publisher=Leatherhalloffame.com |date= |accessdate=2019-12-31}}</ref>\n\nOriginal works by Laaksonen are at the [[Leather Archives and Museum]].\n\n===Exhibitions===\nNew York's [[Museum of Modern Art]] has acquired several examples of Laaksonen's artwork for its permanent collection.<ref>Arell & Mustola, p. 187</ref> In 2006, MoMA in New York accepted five Tom of Finland drawings as part of a much larger gift from The Judith Rothschild Foundation.
