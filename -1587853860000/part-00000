Andy is assigned to prosecute the murder of Ben Litkin, a classmate of Jacob's who is found stabbed to death in the park near their middle school. Despite concerns from Attorney General Lynn Canavan ([[Sakina Jaffrey]]) and Andy's colleague and rival Neal Logiudice ([[Pablo Schreiber]]) that Andy's preexisting relationship with parents and students at the school will cause a conflict of interest, he insists on prosecuting the case. Andy and Detective Paula Duffy ([[Betty Gabriel]]) question students at the school, but are unable to discern a motive for the murder. While questioning Jacob privately about Ben, Jacob tells Andy and Laurie that Ben was unlikeable and later expresses frustration to Andy over the exaggerated false sympathy from his classmates over Ben's death. Duffy discovers a possible suspect, Leonard Patz ([[Daniel Henshall]]), a convicted sexual predator, but Andy is advised against bringing him in until they find solid evidence. That night, Andy discovers an online message board memorializing Ben and becomes disturbed after reading a series of comments, including one from Jacob's friend Derek ([[Defending Jacob (miniseries)|Ben Taylor]]), accusing Jacob of murdering Ben. Andy searches Jacob's room and finds a knife fitting the description of the murder weapon hidden in his drawer. \n |LineColor       = 000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 2\n |Title           = Everything Is Cool\n |DirectedBy      = Morten Tyldum\n |WrittenBy       = Mark Bomback\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|24}}\n |ShortSummary    = Andy and Laurie confront Jacob about the knife and message board. Jacob insists he never used the knife and that the comments are meaningless. Andy is nonetheless unsettled and disposes of the knife in a neighbour's trash. The police bring in Leonard Patz for questioning but are unable to implicate him in the murder and he is released. At school, Jacob is approached by a classmate, Sarah ([[Defending Jacob (miniseries)|Jordan Alexa Davis]]), who informs him that Derek has been spreading some disturbing information about Jacob's involvement with Ben. On the way home from school, Jacob sees police outside the house and, panicked, runs away. Meanwhile, Andy is blindsided when he is informed that he has been removed from the case. At the DAs office, Lynn tells Andy that the lone fingerprint they picked up from Ben's body belongs to Jacob and that Jacob has become the prime suspect in the case; Andy is upset when he learns that Neal has been assigned to prosecute in his place. The police obtain a search warrant and Andy and Laurie wait outside their home while it searched. Jacob is eventually found at a playground and is picked up by a police officer. He insists that he is innocent, but reveals that he found Ben's body the morning of his death and didn't tell anyone as he was afraid he would get blamed for it. Andy and Laurie learn that Jacob will be held overnight in jail before his arraignment the following morning. Both Andy and Laurie maintain faith in their son's innocence and return to their ransacked home without their son, while the news of Jacob's arrest spreads throughout town. At a diner, Leonard Patz looks through his photo album, filled with photos of Ben Litkin, before deleting them. \n |LineColor       = 000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 3\n |Title           = Poker Faces\n |DirectedBy      = Morten Tyldum\n |WrittenBy       = Mark Bomback\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|24}}\n |ShortSummary    = \n |LineColor       = 000\n}}\n<!--{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 4\n |Title           = \n |DirectedBy      = Morten Tyldum\n |WrittenBy       = Mark Bomback\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|5|1}}\n |ShortSummary    = \n |LineColor       = 000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 5\n |Title           = \n |DirectedBy      = Morten Tyldum\n |WrittenBy       = Mark Bomback\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|5|8}}\n |ShortSummary    = \n |LineColor       = 000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 6\n |Title           = \n |DirectedBy      = Morten Tyldum\n |WrittenBy       = Mark Bomback\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|5|15}}\n |ShortSummary    = \n |LineColor       = 000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 7\n |Title           = \n |DirectedBy      = Morten Tyldum\n |WrittenBy       = Mark Bomback\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|5|22}}\n |ShortSummary    = \n |LineColor       = 000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 8\n |Title           = \n |DirectedBy      = Morten Tyldum\n |WrittenBy       = Mark Bomback\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|5|29}}\n |ShortSummary    = \n |LineColor       = 000\n}}-->\n}}\n\nThe remaining episodes of the first season include, all written by Mark Bomback:{{efn|name=Order|Episodes are currently ordered as they appear on the [[Writers Guild of America West]] website.<ref name=\"WGA\">{{Cite web |url=https://directories.wga.org/project/1190756/defending-jacob/ |title=Defending Jacob |website=[[Writers Guild of America West]] |access-date=March 22, 2020}}</ref>}} \n\n* \"After\"\n* \"Damage Control\"\n* \"Ilunga\"\n* \"Visitors\"\n* \"Wishful Thinking\"\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nOn September 20, 2018, it was announced that [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] had given a straight-to-series order consisting of eight episodes to a television miniseries adaptation of [[William Landay]]'s 2012 novel ''[[Defending Jacob]]''.

Andy is assigned to prosecute the murder of Ben Litkin, a classmate of Jacob's who is found stabbed to death in the park near their middle school. Despite concerns from Attorney General Lynn Canavan ([[Sakina Jaffrey]]) and Andy's colleague and rival Neal Logiudice ([[Pablo Schreiber]]) that Andy's preexisting relationship with parents and students at the school will cause a conflict of interest, he insists on prosecuting the case. Andy and Detective Paula Duffy ([[Betty Gabriel]]) question students at the school, but are unable to discern a motive for the murder. While questioning Jacob privately about Ben, Jacob tells Andy and Laurie that Ben was unlikeable and later expresses frustration to Andy over the exaggerated false sympathy from his classmates over Ben's death. Duffy discovers a possible suspect, Leonard Patz ([[Daniel Henshall]]), a convicted sexual predator, but Andy is advised against bringing him in until they find solid evidence. That night, Andy discovers an online message board memorializing Ben and becomes disturbed after reading a series of comments, including one from Jacob's friend Derek ([[Defending Jacob (miniseries)|Ben Taylor]]), accusing Jacob of murdering Ben. Andy searches Jacob's room and finds a knife fitting the description of the murder weapon hidden in his drawer. \n |LineColor       = 000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 2\n |Title           = Everything Is Cool\n |DirectedBy      = Morten Tyldum\n |WrittenBy       = Mark Bomback\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|24}}\n |ShortSummary    = Andy and Laurie confront Jacob about the knife and message board. Jacob insists he never used the knife and that the comments are meaningless. Andy is nonetheless unsettled and disposes of the knife in a neighbour's trash. The police bring in Leonard Patz for questioning but are unable to implicate him in the murder and he is released. At school, Jacob is approached by a classmate, Sarah ([[Defending Jacob (miniseries)|Jordan Alexa Davis]]), who informs him that Derek has been spreading some disturbing information about Jacob's involvement with Ben. On the way home from school, Jacob sees police outside the house and, panicked, runs away. Meanwhile, Andy is blindsided when he is informed that he has been removed from the case. At the DAs office, Lynn tells Andy that the lone fingerprint they picked up from Ben's body belongs to Jacob and that Jacob has become the prime suspect in the case; Andy is upset when he learns that Neal has been assigned to prosecute in his place. The police obtain a search warrant and Andy and Laurie wait outside their home while it searched. Jacob is eventually found at a playground and is picked up by a police officer. He insists that he is innocent, but reveals that he found Ben's body the morning of his death and didn't tell anyone as he was afraid he would get blamed for it. Andy and Laurie learn that Jacob will be held overnight in jail before his arraignment the following morning. Both Andy and Laurie maintain faith in their son's innocence and return to their ransacked home without their son, while the news of Jacob's arrest spreads throughout town. At a diner, Leonard Patz looks through his photo album, filled with photos of Ben Litkin, before deleting them. \n |LineColor       = 000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 3\n |Title           = Poker Faces\n |DirectedBy      = Morten Tyldum\n |WrittenBy       = Mark Bomback\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|24}}\n |ShortSummary    = \n |LineColor       = 000\n}}\n<!--{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 4\n |Title           = \n |DirectedBy      = Morten Tyldum\n |WrittenBy       = Mark Bomback\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|5|1}}\n |ShortSummary    = \n |LineColor       = 000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 5\n |Title           = \n |DirectedBy      = Morten Tyldum\n |WrittenBy       = Mark Bomback\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|5|8}}\n |ShortSummary    = \n |LineColor       = 000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 6\n |Title           = \n |DirectedBy      = Morten Tyldum\n |WrittenBy       = Mark Bomback\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|5|15}}\n |ShortSummary    = \n |LineColor       = 000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 7\n |Title           = \n |DirectedBy      = Morten Tyldum\n |WrittenBy       = Mark Bomback\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|5|22}}\n |ShortSummary    = \n |LineColor       = 000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 8\n |Title           = \n |DirectedBy      = Morten Tyldum\n |WrittenBy       = Mark Bomback\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|5|29}}\n |ShortSummary    = \n |LineColor       = 000\n}}-->\n}}\n\nThe remaining episodes of the first season include, all written by Mark Bomback:{{efn|name=Order|Episodes are currently ordered as they appear on the [[Writers Guild of America West]] website.<ref name=\"WGA\">{{Cite web |url=https://directories.wga.org/project/1190756/defending-jacob/ |title=Defending Jacob |website=[[Writers Guild of America West]] |access-date=March 22, 2020}}</ref>}} \n\n* \"After\"\n* \"Damage Control\"\n* \"Ilunga\"\n* \"Visitors\"\n* \"Wishful Thinking\"\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nOn September 20, 2018, it was announced that [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] had given a straight-to-series order consisting of eight episodes to a television miniseries adaptation of [[William Landay]]'s 2012 novel ''[[Defending Jacob]]''.
