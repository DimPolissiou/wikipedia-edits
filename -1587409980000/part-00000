Grimaldi operates a large fleet of [[Roll-on/roll-off|ro-ro]] vessels.\n\n==Shipping==\nThe Grimaldi Group is a conglomerate of companies linked to the logistics business with a main-focus on shipping. The main brands of the company are:<ref name=\"grphome\">Grimaldi group [http://www.grimaldi.napoli.it/en/index.html website], visited 8 October 2011</ref>\n* [[Grimaldi Lines]] \u2013 cargo and ferry company\n* [[Atlantic Container Line]] \u2013 Roll-on roll-off and container-based cargo services in the North Atlantic\n* [[Minoan Lines]] \u2013 a ferry company sailing between Italy and Greece and within Greece\n* [[Finnlines]] \u2013 a ferry company operating in the [[Baltic Sea]]\n* [[Malta Motorways of the Sea]] \u2013 a ferry company operating in the Mediterranean between Italy, Spain, [[Tunisia]], [[Libya]] and [[Malta]]\n\n===Grimaldi Lines===\nThis is the main shipping company within the group. The Grimaldi family has had links to shipping for many generations. According to their own records, the oldest written records linking the Grimaldi family to shipping dates back to 1348, when three Grimaldi brothers received a precious relic as a guarantee for the chartering of three ships.<ref name=\"lineshist\">Grimaldi Lines website: [http://www.grimaldi-lines.com/en/our-history.html Our history], visited 8 October 2011</ref>\n\nThe current Grimaldi companies can be traced back to the middle of the 19th century, when Italian shipowner Gioacchino Lauro started a steamboat company. His son Achille expanded that shipping company and, in the middle of the 20th century, it became one of the largest shipping companies in the world. At that time, Giovanni Grimaldi was a lawyer who was married to the sister of above Achille Lauro. Amelia Grimaldi-Lauro asked her brother Achille to take her son Guido under his wings, and this brought the Grimaldi family back into the shipping business. It was this son, Guido, who founded the group in 1947 with his brothers Luigi, Mario, Aldo and Ugo by buying a [[Liberty ship]].\n\n===Ferry operations===\nGrimaldi Lines operate ferry-lines with routes in the Mediterranean. They have routes to Spain, Morocco, Tunisia, Malta and Italy. Under the Grimaldi Lines brand they operate six [[Roll-on/roll-off|ro-ro]] ferries.

Grimaldi operates a large fleet of [[Roll-on/roll-off|ro-ro]] vessels.\n\n==Shipping==\nThe Grimaldi Group is a conglomerate of companies linked to the logistics business with a main-focus on shipping. The main brands of the company are:<ref name=\"grphome\">Grimaldi group [http://www.grimaldi.napoli.it/en/index.html website], visited 8 October 2011</ref>\n* [[Grimaldi Lines]] \u2013 cargo and ferry company\n* [[Atlantic Container Line]] \u2013 Roll-on roll-off and container-based cargo services in the North Atlantic\n* [[Minoan Lines]] \u2013 a ferry company sailing between Italy and Greece and within Greece\n* [[Finnlines]] \u2013 a ferry company operating in the [[Baltic Sea]]\n* [[Malta Motorways of the Sea]] \u2013 a ferry company operating in the Mediterranean between Italy, Spain, [[Tunisia]], [[Libya]] and [[Malta]]\n\n===Grimaldi Lines===\nThis is the main shipping company within the group. The Grimaldi family has had links to shipping for many generations. According to their own records, the oldest written records linking the Grimaldi family to shipping dates back to 1348, when three Grimaldi brothers received a precious relic as a guarantee for the chartering of three ships.<ref name=\"lineshist\">Grimaldi Lines website: [http://www.grimaldi-lines.com/en/our-history.html Our history], visited 8 October 2011</ref>\n\nThe current Grimaldi companies can be traced back to the middle of the 19th century, when Italian shipowner Gioacchino Lauro started a steamboat company. His son Achille expanded that shipping company and, in the middle of the 20th century, it became one of the largest shipping companies in the world. At that time, Giovanni Grimaldi was a lawyer who was married to the sister of above Achille Lauro. Amelia Grimaldi-Lauro asked her brother Achille to take her son Guido under his wings, and this brought the Grimaldi family back into the shipping business. It was this son, Guido, who founded the group in 1947 with his brothers Luigi, Mario, Aldo and Ugo by buying a [[Liberty ship]].\n\n===Ferry operations===\nGrimaldi Lines operate ferry-lines with routes in the Mediterranean. They have routes to Spain, Morocco, Tunisia, Malta and Italy. Under the Grimaldi Lines brand they operate six [[Roll-on/roll-off|ro-ro]] ferries. The ships in the Grimaldi Lines fleet vary in size and design, with the larger ferries being able to carry up to 2200 passengers and a cruise-speed of 22.5 [[Knot (unit)|knots]]\n\n====Current Fleet====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The tunnelling units were occupied in offensive and defensive mining involving the placing and maintaining of [[Mining (military)|mines]] under enemy lines, as well as other underground work such as the construction of [[Dugout (shelter)#World War I|deep dugouts]] for troop accommodation, the digging of subways, saps (a narrow trench dug to approach enemy trenches), cable trenches and  underground chambers for signals and medical services.<ref name=tunnelcoyre>[http://www.1914-1918.net/tunnelcoyre.htm The Tunnelling Companies RE] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150510184955/http://www.1914-1918.net/tunnelcoyre.htm |date=May 10, 2015 }}, access date 25 April 2015</ref>\n\n==Background==\n{{main|Tunnelling companies of the Royal Engineers}}\nBy January 1915 it had become evident to the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|BEF]] at the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] that the Germans were [[Mining (military)|mining]] to a planned system. As the British had failed to develop suitable counter-tactics or underground  listening devices before the war, field marshals [[John French, 1st Earl of Ypres|French]] and [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Kitchener]] agreed to investigate the suitability of forming  British mining units.<ref name=REMJNG/> Following consultations between the Engineer-in-Chief of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|BEF]], Brigadier [[George Henry Fowke|George Fowke]], and the mining specialist [[Sir John Norton-Griffiths, 1st Baronet|John Norton-Griffiths]], the [[War Office]] formally approved the tunnelling company scheme on 19 February 1915.<ref name=REMJNG>{{cite web|url=http://www.remuseum.org.uk/biography/rem_bio_Norton-Griffiths.htm |title=Lieutenant Colonel Sir John Norton-Griffiths (1871\u20131930) |publisher=Royal Engineers Museum |accessdate=2015-12-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060810231451/http://www.remuseum.org.uk/biography/rem_bio_Norton-Griffiths.htm |archivedate=August 10, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nNorton-Griffiths ensured that tunnelling companies numbers 170 to 177 were ready for deployment in mid-February 1915.<ref name = W&R>Watson & Rinaldi, p. 49.</ref> In the spring of that year, there was constant underground fighting in the [[Ypres Salient]] at [[Hooge in World War I|Hooge]], [[Hill 60 (Ypres)|Hill 60]], [[RE Grave, Railway Wood|Railway Wood]], [[Sanctuary Wood Cemetery|Sanctuary Wood]], [[St. Eloi (Ypres)|St Eloi]] and [[The Bluff (Ypres)|The Bluff]] which required the deployment of new drafts of tunnellers for several months after the formation of the first eight companies. The lack of suitably experienced men led to some tunnelling companies starting work later than others. The number of units available to the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|BEF]] was also restricted by the need to provide effective counter-measures to the German mining activities.<ref name=Beneath165>Peter Barton/Peter Doyle/Johan Vandewalle, Beneath Flanders Fields - The Tunnellers' War 1914-1918, Staplehurst (Spellmount) (978-1862272378) p. 165.</ref> To make the tunnels safer and quicker to deploy, the British Army enlisted experienced coal miners, many outside their nominal recruitment policy. The first nine companies, numbers 170 to 178, were each commanded by a regular Royal Engineers officer.

H. Cowan, [[Officer commanding|commanding officer]] of 175th Tunnelling Company, described the situation at Hooge in June 1915: \"''There is some urgent [mining] work to be done at once in a village  [Hooge] on a main road east of Ypres. We hold one half and the job is to get the G[ermans] out of the other, failing that they may get us out and so obtain another hill top from which to overlook the land. It is a significant fact that all their recent attacks round Ypres have been directed on hill tops and have rested content on the same, without trying really hard to advance down the slopes towards us.''\"<ref name=Beneath148154>Peter Barton/Peter Doyle/Johan Vandewalle, Beneath Flanders Fields - The Tunnellers' War 1914-1918, Staplehurst (Spellmount) (978-1862272378) pp. 148\u2013154.</ref>\n\nIn order to break the stalemate, the 175th Tunnelling Company (which was at the time operating with the [[3rd Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|3rd Division]]) dug a tunnel about {{convert|60|m|yd|order=flip}} long<ref name=\"ww1hooge\"/> under the German position and placed a [[Mining (military)|mine]] there. This occurred during a time of relative quiet on the British part of the Western Front, when few major assaults were made. Nonetheless, the average casualty rate for the British and Commonwealth forces was around 300 per day.<ref name=\"ww1battlefieldshooge\">[http://www.ww1battlefields.co.uk/flanders/hooge.html Hooge on ''ww1battlefields.co.uk''], accessed 25  April 2015</ref>\n\nThe officer in charge of laying the mine at Hooge was Lieutenant Geoffrey Cassels. He wrote: \"''[Hooge] was a small village in ruins on top of the ridge, Hooge meaning height, astride the Menin Road. On the north side of the road was a chateau with a separate annex standing in its own grounds by a large wood. Behind the chateau was Bellewarde Lake. In front of the chateau and east of the village proper were the racing stables (...). The stables were at the very apex of the salient. They were actually in our front line. The trenches were shallow and primitive, even the front line ones, and to reach the front lines some tunnels had been driven under the road and part of the ruins. No Man's Land between us and the Germans was littered with blackened corpses (...) and the stink was abominable. (...) Our objective was to sink a shaft, then tunnel under the chateau and annex and blow them up.''\"<ref name=Beneath148154/>\n\nThe work was completed in five and a half weeks. The first attempt at tunnelling for the mine, starting from within a stable, failed because the soil was too sandy. A second shaft was sunk from the ruins of a gardener's cottage nearby. The main tunnel was in the end {{convert|190|ft|m}} long, with a branch off this after about {{convert|70|ft|m}}, this second tunnel running a further {{convert|100|ft|m}} on. The intention was to blow two charges under the German concrete fortifications, although the smaller tunnel was found to be off course. The explosive \u2013 used for the first time by the British \u2013 was [[ammonal]] supported by [[gunpowder]] and [[guncotton]], making the Hooge mine the largest mine of the war thus far built.<ref name=\"ww1battlefieldshooge\"/> The main difficulties for the [[Tunnelling companies of the Royal Engineers|tunnellers]] were that the water table is very high, and that the clay expands as soon as it comes into contact with the air.<ref name=\"ww1hooge\"/>\n\nAt 07.00 p.m. on 19 July 1915 the mine was fired.

From June 1916, however, the Germans withdrew many miners to work on the [[Hindenburg Line]] and also for work in coal mines in Germany. In the second half of 1916 the British constructed strong defensive underground positions, and from August 1916, the  Royal Engineers developed a mining scheme to support a large-scale infantry attack on the Vimy Ridge proposed for autumn 1916, although this was subsequently postponed.{{sfn|Jones|2010|p=133}} After September 1916, when the Royal Engineers had completed their network of defensive galleries along most of the front line, offensive mining largely ceased<ref name=\"durandvimy\"/> although activities continued until 1917.

These fortifications were constructed in the spring of 1917, although the 175th Tunnelling Company had been digging to create underground headquarters here for some months before that.

H. Cowan, [[Officer commanding|commanding officer]] of 175th Tunnelling Company, described the situation at Hooge in June 1915: \"''There is some urgent [mining] work to be done at once in a village  [Hooge] on a main road east of Ypres. We hold one half and the job is to get the G[ermans] out of the other, failing that they may get us out and so obtain another hill top from which to overlook the land. It is a significant fact that all their recent attacks round Ypres have been directed on hill tops and have rested content on the same, without trying really hard to advance down the slopes towards us.''\"<ref name=Beneath148154>Peter Barton/Peter Doyle/Johan Vandewalle, Beneath Flanders Fields - The Tunnellers' War 1914-1918, Staplehurst (Spellmount) (978-1862272378) pp. 148\u2013154.</ref> \n\nIn order to break the stalemate, the 175th Tunnelling Company (which was at the time operating with the [[3rd Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|3rd Division]]) dug a tunnel about {{convert|60|m|yd|order=flip}} long<ref name=\"ww1hooge\"/> under the German position and placed a [[Mining (military)|mine]] there. This occurred during a time of relative quiet on the British part of the Western Front, when few major assaults were made. Nonetheless, the average casualty rate for the British and Commonwealth forces was around 300 per day.<ref name=\"ww1battlefieldshooge\">[http://www.ww1battlefields.co.uk/flanders/hooge.html Hooge on ''ww1battlefields.co.uk''], accessed 25  April 2015</ref>\n\nThe officer in charge of laying the mine at Hooge was Lieutenant Geoffrey Cassels. He wrote: \"''[Hooge] was a small village in ruins on top of the ridge, Hooge meaning height, astride the Menin Road. On the north side of the road was a chateau with a separate annex standing in its own grounds by a large wood. Behind the chateau was Bellewarde Lake. In front of the chateau and east of the village proper were the racing stables (...). The stables were at the very apex of the salient. They were actually in our front line. The trenches were shallow and primitive, even the front line ones, and to reach the front lines some tunnels had been driven under the road and part of the ruins. No Man's Land between us and the Germans was littered with blackened corpses (...) and the stink was abominable. (...) Our objective was to sink a shaft, then tunnel under the chateau and annex and blow them up.''\"<ref name=Beneath148154/>\n\nThe work was completed in five and a half weeks. The first attempt at tunnelling for the mine, starting from within a stable, failed because the soil was too sandy. A second shaft was sunk from the ruins of a gardener's cottage nearby. The main tunnel was in the end {{convert|190|ft|m}} long, with a branch off this after about {{convert|70|ft|m}}, this second tunnel running a further {{convert|100|ft|m}} on. The intention was to blow two charges under the German concrete fortifications, although the smaller tunnel was found to be off course. The explosive \u2013 used for the first time by the British \u2013 was [[ammonal]] supported by [[gunpowder]] and [[guncotton]], making the Hooge mine the largest mine of the war thus far built.<ref name=\"ww1battlefieldshooge\"/> The main difficulties for the [[Tunnelling companies of the Royal Engineers|tunnellers]] were that the water table is very high, and that the clay expands as soon as it comes into contact with the air.<ref name=\"ww1hooge\"/> \n\nAt 07.00 p.m. on 19 July 1915 the mine was fired. The explosion created a hole some {{convert|6|m|yd|order=flip}} deep and almost {{convert|40|m|yd|order=flip}} wide.<ref name=\"ww1hooge\"/> The far side of the crater was then taken and secured by men from the 1st Battalion, [[Gordon Highlanders]] and 4th Battalion, [[Middlesex Regiment]]. Ten of the latter were killed by debris from the mine as they waited in advanced positions.<ref name=\"ww1battlefieldshooge\"/> The mine fired by 175th Tunnelling Company at Hooge on 19 July 1915 was only the second British offensive underground attack in the Ypres Salient. On 17 April 1915, [[173rd Tunnelling Company]] had blown five mines at [[Hill 60 (Ypres)|Hill 60]] using [[gunpowder]] and [[guncotton]], but none of these mines were even half as powerful as the Hooge charge.<ref>Peter Barton/Peter Doyle/Johan Vandewalle, Beneath Flanders Fields - The Tunnellers' War 1914-1918, Staplehurst (Spellmount) (978-1862272378) p. 148-154, in particular p. 152.</ref>\n\nThe Germans tried to recover their lost position but were driven back by infantry and a heavy artillery bombardment.<ref name=\"ww1hooge\"/> By 30 July the German units had managed to take control of the Ch\u00e2teau de Hooge and the surrounding area.<ref name=\"bf1418\"/> In November 1915, [[177th Tunnelling Company]] arrived at Hooge and continued mining there in the defence of Ypres until August 1917.

The British underground works consisted of an access gallery (nicknamed ''Berlin Tunnel'') leading to two mine chambers called ''Hill 60 A'' (beneath Hill 60) and ''Hill 60 B'' (beneath The Caterpillar). The [[3rd Canadian Tunnelling Company]] took over in April 1916 and completed the galleries, the Hill 60 mine being charged with {{convert|53300|lb|kg}} of explosives in July 1916 and a branch gallery under the Caterpillar filled with a {{convert|70000|lb|kg|adj=on}} charge in October. The [[1st Australian Tunnelling Company]] took over in November 1916 and maintained the mines at Hill 60  over the winter.{{sfn|Edmonds|1948|p=60}}{{sfn|Bean|1933|pp=949\u2013959}} \n\nMeanwhile, the bulk of 175th Tunnelling Company had moved briefly to [[Spanbroekmolen]] in April 1916.<ref name=tunnelcoyre /> Also in April 1916, 175th Tunnelling Company took over work on the deep mines at Kruisstraat from [[3rd Canadian Tunnelling Company]]. 175th Tunnelling Company continued to drive the galleries forward and when the main tunnel reached {{convert|1,051|ft|m|order=flip}} it was handed over to [[171st Tunnelling Company]]  who were also responsible for Spanbroekmolen.{{sfn|Holt|Holt|2014|p=195}}\n\nAs part of the prelude to the [[Battle of Messines (1917)|Battle of Messines]], deep mine galleries were dug by the [[171st Tunnelling Company|British 171st]], 175th and [[250th Tunnelling Company|250th]] Tunnelling companies and the [[1st Canadian Tunnelling Company|1st Canadian]], [[3rd Canadian Tunnelling Company|3rd Canadian]] and [[1st Australian Tunnelling Company|1st Australian]] Tunnelling companies, while the [[183rd Tunnelling Company|British 183rd]], [[2nd Canadian Tunnelling Company|2nd Canadian]] and [[2nd Australian Tunnelling Company|2nd Australian]] Tunnelling companies built [[Dugout (shelter)|dugouts]] (underground shelters) in the [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|Second Army]] area.{{sfn|Edmonds|1948|p=37\u201338}} The mines at Messines were detonated on 7 June 1917, creating {{nowrap|19 large}} craters.\n\n===Vimy Ridge===\n{{Main|Battle of Vimy Ridge}}\nHaving handed over its share of the work at Messines, 175th Tunnelling Company moved to [[Vimy]],  an area of busy underground activity for much of the war.

From June 1916, however, the Germans withdrew many miners to work on the [[Hindenburg Line]] and also for work in coal mines in Germany. In the second half of 1916 the British constructed strong defensive underground positions, and from August 1916, the  Royal Engineers developed a mining scheme to support a large-scale infantry attack on the Vimy Ridge proposed for autumn 1916, although this was subsequently postponed.{{sfn|Jones|2010|p=133}} After September 1916, when the Royal Engineers had completed their network of defensive galleries along most of the front line, offensive mining largely ceased<ref name=\"durandvimy\"/> although activities continued until 1917. The British gallery network beneath Vimy Ridge eventually grew to a length of {{convert|12|km|mi|}}.<ref name=\"durandvimy\"/> \n\nIn October 1916, 175th Tunnelling Company moved away again from the Vimy sector<ref name=\"durandvimy\"/> and returned to the Ypres Salient.\n\n===Lettenberg Bunkers===\n175th Tunnelling Company then deployed to [[Loker]], about two miles west of [[Kemmel]] and near [[Wijtschate]], where it constructed bunkers. Known as the ''Lettenberg Bunkers'', they are located at the edge of a woodland along the road from Kemmel, climbing up a hill towards Loker. These fortifications were constructed in the spring of 1917, although the 175th Tunnelling Company had been digging to create underground headquarters here for some months before that. There are four bunkers, including a first aid post which has a red cross painted on the wall, and a command post located at the far end. There are information boards outside the bunkers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ww1battlefields.co.uk/flanders/kemmel.html |title=World War One Battlefields : Flanders: Kemmel & Bayernwald Trenches |publisher=Ww1battlefields.co.uk |accessdate=2015-10-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151101051308/http://www.ww1battlefields.co.uk/flanders/kemmel.html |archive-date=2015-11-01 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Hermies 1918===\nDestroyed the entrance inclines to [[Hermies]] catacombs in March 1918, as the enemy advanced from [[Cambrai]].<ref name=tunnelcoyre />\n\n===Somme 1918===\n{{main|Battle of the Ancre (1918)}}\nBuilt bridges over the Ancre in the British advanced on the Somme in Autumn 1918.<ref name=tunnelcoyre />\n\n==See also==\n* [[Mining (military)|Mine warfare]]\n\n==References==\nAn overview of the history of 175th Tunnelling Company is also available in Robert K.
