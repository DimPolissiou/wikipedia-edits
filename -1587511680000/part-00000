California's interpretation of inverse condemnation is unique. The tenet is applied in other states, usually to government entities that damage private property when engaged in a public service. California's courts have ruled the principle can be applied to utilities. So the utilities are held liable for damage, even if they comply with all of California's strict energy-related rules.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Baker |first1=David |title=The California Rule That Doomed PG&E: Inverse Condemnation |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-15/the-california-rule-that-doomed-pg-e-inverse-condemnation |website=Bloomberg.com |publisher=Bloomberg LP |location=New York NY |date=January 15, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThis policy resulted in $30B of liability for PG&E from the 2017 & 2018 fires and drove it to bankruptcy proceedings.{{ r | LAT_1 | p=1 | q=PG&E filed for bankruptcy protection in January in anticipation of massive legal fees resulting from wildfires linked to its electrical equipment in recent years.

With aging infrastructure electrifying remote areas of increasingly hot and dry terrain, the cost and risk have grown significantly in recent years. Pacific Gas & Electric filed for bankruptcy, anticipating some $30 billion in liability for fires in 2017 and 2018, earlier this year. }}\nIn July 2019, a new $21 billion wildfire trust fund was created to pay for damages from future wildfires, started with a 50-50 balance of utility and customer monies and also reduced the liability threshold for utilities to where customers must prove negilgence before companies are held liable.{{ r | LAT_2 | p=1 | q=California&apos;s investor-owned utility companies have agreed to open up their wallets to pay into the state&apos;s wildfire fund in exchange for less financial responsibility when blazes are linked to their equipment. ... The fund, propped up by $21 billion split equally between utility customers and shareholders, is meant to act as a second insurance policy for publicly traded electricity companies and to offset concerns from Wall Street about massive monetary liabilities that have threatened to upend the energy market in California. ... The law takes $10.5 billion from electricity customers through the continuation of a charge on monthly bills that was set to expire next year. In return, wildfire costs that would typically lead to higher bills for customers will instead be paid out by the fund, potentially avoiding price hikes. ... For their $10.5 billion, the utilities are allowed to tap into the fund to pay wildfire damages that exceed insurance coverage. The law also shifts the burden of proof in regulatory proceedings \u2014 another benefit for the utilities \u2014 and requires outside groups to intervene to prove that the company failed to properly manage its system to prevent the fire. }}\n\nCritics of inverse condemnation point out that it can lead to utility bankruptcies which can threaten the integrity of the California power grid as well as hurt financing the states' efforts for renewable energy and against climate change, one of the causes of the intensified fire threat.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Bradford |first1=Peter |title=Making PG&E pay more than its fair share of fire damage could backfire on the state |url=https://www.sacbee.com/opinion/california-forum/article212316269.html |work=Sacramento Bee |publisher=McClatchy Company |date=May 31, 2018 |location=Sacramento CA}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to court cases in recent years and the evolution of [[case law]] which have made new standards of legal liability, the [[Government of California|California State]] [[California State Legislature|legislature]] and the [[Governor of California|Governor]]<!-- it take both legislature and governor to enact a law; so action on both sides of the government of california here --> also enacted new [[statutory law]]s to modify the legal regime under which electrical utilities operate in California.

California's interpretation of inverse condemnation is unique. The tenet is applied in other states, usually to government entities that damage private property when engaged in a public service. California's courts have ruled the principle can be applied to utilities.

With aging infrastructure electrifying remote areas of increasingly hot and dry terrain, the cost and risk have grown significantly in recent years. Pacific Gas & Electric filed for bankruptcy, anticipating some $30 billion in liability for fires in 2017 and 2018, earlier this year. }}\nIn July 2019, a new $21 billion wildfire trust fund was created to pay for damages from future wildfires, started with a 50-50 balance of utility and customer monies and also reduced the liability threshold for utilities to where customers must prove negilgence before companies are held liable.{{ r | LAT_2 | p=1 | q=California&apos;s investor-owned utility companies have agreed to open up their wallets to pay into the state&apos;s wildfire fund in exchange for less financial responsibility when blazes are linked to their equipment. ...

The law takes $10.5 billion from electricity customers through the continuation of a charge on monthly bills that was set to expire next year. In return, wildfire costs that would typically lead to higher bills for customers will instead be paid out by the fund, potentially avoiding price hikes. ... For their $10.5 billion, the utilities are allowed to tap into the fund to pay wildfire damages that exceed insurance coverage. The law also shifts the burden of proof in regulatory proceedings \u2014 another benefit for the utilities \u2014 and requires outside groups to intervene to prove that the company failed to properly manage its system to prevent the fire. }}\n\nCritics of inverse condemnation point out that it can lead to utility bankruptcies which can threaten the integrity of the California power grid as well as hurt financing the states' efforts for renewable energy and against climate change, one of the causes of the intensified fire threat.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Bradford |first1=Peter |title=Making PG&E pay more than its fair share of fire damage could backfire on the state |url=https://www.sacbee.com/opinion/california-forum/article212316269.html |work=Sacramento Bee |publisher=McClatchy Company |date=May 31, 2018 |location=Sacramento CA}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to court cases in recent years and the evolution of [[case law]] which have made new standards of legal liability, the [[Government of California|California State]] [[California State Legislature|legislature]] and the [[Governor of California|Governor]]<!-- it take both legislature and governor to enact a law; so action on both sides of the government of california here --> also enacted new [[statutory law]]s to modify the legal regime under which electrical utilities operate in California.
