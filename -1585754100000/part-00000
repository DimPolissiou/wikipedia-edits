They differ not only in method, but also in strict ideology and interpretation, although they are generally within the [[Marxist]] [[communism]] tradition.\n\nThe formation of communist parties in various countries was first initiated by the Russian [[Bolsheviks]] within the [[Communist International]]. Since then, communist parties have governed numerous countries, whether as ruling parties in [[one-party states]] like the [[Communist Party of China]] or the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], or as ruling parties in [[multi-party system]]s, including majority and minority governments as well as leading or being part of several coalitions.\n\nMany other communist parties did not govern any country, but they did govern several states or region within a country. Others have also been represented in the national, state or regional [[parliament]]s. Some communist parties and [[List of communist ideologies|schools of thought]] reject [[parliamentarism]], advocating in its place [[insurrection]] or [[social revolution]] as well as [[workers' council]]s.\n\n== Officially ruling in communist states ==\nIn the following countries, several communist parties either lead the ruling coalition or hold monopoly on state power as defined by their respective country's constitutions.\n* {{flag+link|List of political parties in|China}}{{efn|[[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] are administrated under the \"[[One country, two systems]]\" principle.}} \u2013 [[Communist Party of China]] leads the [[United Front (People's Republic of China)|United Front]]\n* {{flag+link|List of political parties in|Cuba}} \u2013 [[Communist Party of Cuba]]\n* {{flag+link|List of political parties in|North Korea}}{{efn|The [[Workers' Party of Korea]] is considered by some scholars to not be a communist party. <ref>{{cite book|title=Ethnic Nationalism in Korea: Genealogy, Politics, and Legacy|last=Shin|first=Gi-wook|publisher=[[Stanford University Press]]|year=2006|isbn=9780804754088}}</ref> While recently it started to consider itself as [[Juche]]ist exclusively, the party nonetheless participates in the [[International Meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties]].<ref>[http://www.solidnet.org/15-imcwp/15-imcwp-list-of-participants \"List of participants of 15th International Meeting of Communist and Workers'\"].

[[communist parties]] active in various countries across the world and a number that used to be active. They differ not only in method, but also in strict ideology and interpretation, although they are generally within the [[Marxist]] [[communism]] tradition.\n\nThe formation of communist parties in various countries was first initiated by the Russian [[Bolsheviks]] within the [[Communist International]]. Since then, communist parties have governed numerous countries, whether as ruling parties in [[one-party states]] like the [[Communist Party of China]] or the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], or as ruling parties in [[multi-party system]]s, including majority and minority governments as well as leading or being part of several coalitions.\n\nMany other communist parties did not govern any country, but they did govern several states or region within a country. Others have also been represented in the national, state or regional [[parliament]]s. Some communist parties and [[List of communist ideologies|schools of thought]] reject [[Parliamentarism|parliamentary representation]] and advocate [[insurrection]] or [[social revolution]].\n\n== Officially ruling in communist states ==\nIn the following countries, several communist parties either lead the ruling coalition or hold monopoly on state power as defined by their respective country's constitutions.\n* {{flag+link|List of political parties in|China}}{{efn|[[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] are administrated under the \"[[One country, two systems]]\" principle.}} \u2013 [[Communist Party of China]] leads the [[United Front (People's Republic of China)|United Front]]\n* {{flag+link|List of political parties in|Cuba}} \u2013 [[Communist Party of Cuba]]\n* {{flag+link|List of political parties in|North Korea}}{{efn|The [[Workers' Party of Korea]] is considered by some scholars to not be a communist party. <ref>{{cite book|title=Ethnic Nationalism in Korea: Genealogy, Politics, and Legacy|last=Shin|first=Gi-wook|publisher=[[Stanford University Press]]|year=2006|isbn=9780804754088}}</ref> While recently it started to consider itself as [[Juche]]ist exclusively, the party nonetheless participates in the [[International Meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties]].<ref>[http://www.solidnet.org/15-imcwp/15-imcwp-list-of-participants \"List of participants of 15th International Meeting of Communist and Workers'\"].

The 308th's wartime mission is to provide combat rescue capabilities to recover downed aircrew members and isolated personnel.

For that mission, the squadron will have 3 teams ready.\n\nDuring ascent for Starliner, Dragon, and Orion, the 304th Rescue Squadron will have two teams stationed along the east coast of the United States, one at Patrick Air Force Base (just South of the Cape) and the other in Charleston, South Carolina. The Patrick team, Rescue 1, will be responsible for on-pad aborts that place a capsule in the water or for aborts in the first couple minutes of flight that place the capsule within a 200 nautical mile zone from the Cape. After that distance is exceeded, the Charleston crew (Rescue 2) would be responsible for rescue of a launch-aborting crew vehicle anywhere else across the Atlantic.The third team, stationed in Hawai\u2019i, (also part of Rescue 2) would be responsible for any after-launch immediate landing need or off-nominal Station return contingency that places a Starliner or Dragon in the Pacific. If an off-nominal from orbit return occurred with splashdown in the Atlantic, an emergency ocean return within 200 nautical miles of Cape Canaveral would fall to Rescue 1. Any other Atlantic splashdown would fall to Rescue 2 from Charleston because they have more powerful aircraft that could reach Starliner or Dragon or Orion quicker than the Patrick support craft.\n\nRescue 1 carries a requirement to have a crew en route back to land within 6 hours of splashdown. Rescue 2 carries a requirement to have the hatch on a capsule opened within 24 hours of splashdown and a crew evacuated (via helicopter or ship) from the sea landing area within 72 hours of hatch open.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2019/04/dod-starliner-sea-recovery-first-time/|title=DoD practices Starliner at sea recovery for first time \u2013 NASASpaceFlight.com|language=en-US|access-date=28 April 2019}}</ref> The role ended in July 2011 when NASA's human spaceflight transportation system ended.<ref name=308RSfacts/>\n[[File:...Set...

It is then revealed that he was serving time for a crime he did not commit because Leela's mother [[Sam Lomax]] ([[Lizzie Roper]]) set him up. Sam then visited him in prison before Leela ordering him not to see her otherwise she'll make sure that he will do more time. Cameron reluctantly agrees but then gets his parole moved up. Later when Sam is getting off work Cameron is seen in the back of her car and forces her to drive away from the village and scares her as revenge for what she did to him. He then reveals that he's sticking around in the village.\n\nHe gets a job as co-chef in The Hutch and befriends Leela's half-brother [[Ste Hay]] ([[Kieron Richardson]]) much to the horror of Sam and [[Danny Lomax|Danny]] ([[Stephen Billington]]). Cameron later confronts Leela about Peri asking if she's his daughter. Leela denies it at first but later tells him the truth. Terrified of Peri finding out the truth, Sam and Danny arrange to take her and their other daughter [[Tegan Lomax]] (Jessica Ellis) to New Zealand. Peri becomes depressed at this and drinks a whole bottle of wine, and she is found by Cameron, who she moans to about not wanting to leave. Later angry that Cameron's the reason their leaving, Ste confronts him, but accidentally tells Cameron their leaving. Cameron then tells Leela what Peri told him about not wanting to leave, and they confront Sam and Danny, revealing to Peri that they are her parents, much to the shock of Tegan, Ste and Peri. When Peri later goes missing Cameron goes out in the van looking for her, and accidentally smashes into Sam and Danny's car, killing them. He then flees the scene. He is present at the Lomax house the next day when Leela, Tegan, Ste and [[Ziggy Roscoe]] (Fabrizio Santino) learn of their deaths and goes with Leela to identify their bodies. Later he supports Peri when she believes her brain tumor has returned; but it's just a false alarm. He then smashes Sam's wreath just before the funeral, and strikes a deal with [[Freddie Roscoe]] ([[Charlie Clapham (actor)|Charlie Clapham]]) to plant evidence in Sam's things; including a false confession saying she killed [[Fraser Black]] ([[Jesse Birdsall]]). When Peri is furious that Leela and Tegan believe the note, she moves in with Cameron. Cameron and Ziggy later fall out over Leela, Cameron sets him up by having him drive out to the van that killed Sam and Danny, realizing what it is Ziggy tries to burn it but is arrested by police.\n\nDuring the hospital siege, Cameron sticks with Leela and tries to get into the lift to rescue Tegan and Ziggy but the lift shaft falls, much to their horror. He then protects Leela from [[#Big Bob|Big Bob]] ([[Vincent Ebrahim]]) deflecting the bullet he shot at her back at him, killing him. When his brother [[#Lockie Campbell|Lockie Campbell]] (Nick Rhys) arrives in the village, he reveals to Cameron that he's engaged, and asks him to be his best man. After the wedding train crashes, Cameron helps rescue [[Phoebe McQueen]] (Mandip Gill) from the wreckage and gets the doors open allowing the passengers to escape. Cameron then finds out from Ziggy that Tegan has cancer, so he supports her, encouraging her to tell Leela the truth. Leela then admits she has feelings for him and they begin a relationship much to Peri's delight. When the Lomaxes fall behind with their bills, Cameron breaks into The Dog to get money for them and he narrowly avoids being caught. In January 2015, he reads a text from Peri's mobile phone from her boyfriend [[Tom Cunningham]] ([[Ellis Hollins]]) and correctly assumes that they had sex. When he confronts them about it at school, they lie but a humiliated Peri stows away with Tegan and Ziggy as they prepare to go on holiday. Ziggy then phones Cameron and Leela and they go to collect her. While there Cameron eats soup laced with magic mushrooms and accidentally reveals to Leela that he killed Sam and Danny. Leela tries to call the police but she changes her mind and forces him to leave the village instead.\n\nCameron then returns weeks later when Lockie needs to raise money. He then reveals to Lockie that he killed Sam and Danny, and helps him raise the money by robbing their mother's old boyfriend. Upon his return he learns about Peri's pregnancy and Leela lets him stay for her sake. On Leela and Ziggy's wedding day he kidnaps Leela and she reveals she can never love him for what he's done \u2013 unaware that the wedding camera has recorded the whole thing. Cameron eventually lets Leela go, but is blackmailed by Tom who has seen the footage. Cameron convinces Tom to keep quiet as it would destroy Peri if she found out. Cameron starts a relationship with [[#Celine McQueen|Celine McQueen]] (Sarah George) after he helps her rob a house to raise money. He then supports her when her boss [[#Dr. Charles S'avage|Dr. Charles S'avage]] (Andrew Greenough) finds out the truth, but uncovers the truth about him being a fraud and strikes a deal with him: forget what Celine did and he will not tell anybody about his secret. Dr. S'avage agrees and Cameron uses the money he raised from the house to finance a new restaurant after Lockie caused him to lose his job. Tom later blackmails Cameron to stop Peri having their child be adopted, but Cameron refuses to do so. Tom then uploads the video of what Cameron did to the student-teacher messaging board, but changes his mind at the last minute. He forgets to however delete the video and it is accidentally sent by Ste and [[List of Hollyoaks characters (2007)#Harry Thompson|Harry Thompson]] ([[Parry Glasspool]]). Peri goes into labour after hearing the confession and Cameron, Leela and Tom help her deliver her daughter, [[List of Hollyoaks characters (2015)#Steph Cunningham-Lomax|Steph]]. Peri then calls the police on Cameron. Leela says she can help him run but Cameron refuses, and apologises to Peri and Celine and tells them he loves them, and asks Tom to look after Peri and Steph before handing himself into the police.\n\nCameron is found not guilty after Leela gives a positive character portrayal to the jury. Tegan, Peri, Ziggy and Ste are furious and disown Leela as they believe she still has feelings for Cameron after everything he has done. In December 2015, Leela and Peri decide to leave the village after Leela discovers that Ziggy and Tegan have feelings for one another. Cameron is furious as he does not know where they have gone and ends his relationship with Celine when she lies that Peri has contacted her. After Leela collects Peri from the village a few weeks later, she tells Cameron that he will never see his daughter again. This results in Cameron confessing to Lockie that he killed Sam and Danny on purpose and will kill Leela for keeping him away from Peri. After following Ziggy to Peri and Leela's new flat, he breaks in, turns all the gas on and locks all the doors while Leela is asleep and Peri is out. When Ziggy drops a present off for Peri later, he wakes Leela and she realises that there is a gas leak, so Ziggy breaks the door down and the pair escape as the building explodes; however, Ziggy hits his head as he and Leela are blown away by the explosion. He later dies from his injuries, leaving Tegan heartbroken.\n\nIn 2016, after Ste moves back in with his family, Cameron resents his presence and gets him addicted to [[crystal meth]], which he finds very difficult to overcome. Disgusted by Ste, Leela and Tegan ask him to leave, so he moves in with Harry and his father [[Tony Hutchinson]] ([[Nick Pickard]]), much to Cameron's delight. It later transpires that Cameron murdered Lockie after he discovered that Cameron caused the explosion that killed Ziggy, and this secret comes under threat by the arrival of his cousin, [[Courtney Campbell (Hollyoaks)|Courtney Campbell]] (Amy Conachan), who is desperate to find out where Lockie is. Cameron continues to lie to those he loves, including telling Courtney that he has already had Lockie cremated. Cameron is furious when he discovers that Peri's best friend, [[Nico Blake]] (Persephone Swales-Dawson) has become obsessed with her and held her hostage, and so at the \"Halloween Spooktacular\" festival, Cameron sets fire to the wooden maze where Nico and her mother, [[Sienna Blake]] ([[Anna Passey]]) are. The building is engulfed by flames, and Sienna is rescued, despite her pleas for Nico to be saved. Nico is then killed when the entire structure collapses on her, leaving Sienna distraught. Elsewhere, [[Joe Roscoe]] ([[Ayden Callaghan]]) and [[Mercedes McQueen]] ([[Jennifer Metcalfe]]) are trapped on a ferris wheel, and after Mercedes is saved, an explosion caused by the fire started by Cameron sees Joe fall from the ferris wheel, and later dying in hospital. Cameron later discovers that Celine has footage of him setting the maze on fire, but after overhearing Celine confessing to Tegan that she attempted to murder her stepfather [[Pete Buchanan]] ([[Kai Owen]]), Cameron blackmails Celine into keeping quiet.\n\nCameron begins to panic when Celine threatens to confess to the police the truth about the fire. He confronts Celine before luring her into an abandoned shed where he holds Celine hostage. Later, Cameron visits Celine where she begs him to release her, promising that she will keep quiet about the fire and that she can live with the guilt. Cameron visits Celine's boyfriend, [[Jesse Donovan]] (Luke Jerdy), and, believing Jesse to be totally oblivious to the person responsible for causing the fire, returns to Celine with the possible intention of releasing her. However, on the way to the shack, Cameron intercepts a voice message from Jesse to Celine making him realise that Jesse knows more than he was letting on. Cameron confronts Celine and tearfully tells her that he has no other way to keep her silence but to kill her, promising to make it as quick as possible before strangling her to death, and dumping her corpse in the lake. On Cameron's wedding day to Leela, she gives birth prematurely and the baby is placed in an incubator to help him breathe. Leela names the baby [[List of Hollyoaks characters (2016)#Daniel|Daniel]], after her father Danny. Cameron notices a bruise on the baby and verbally attacks the staff, believing them to be abusing Daniel but it transpires to be a [[Mongolian blue spot]], which is common in mixed race babies. Leela then reveals to Cameron that Daniel is not his son. Cameron then gives Leela an ultimatum: him or Daniel. Leela subsequently chooses Daniel, so Cameron leaves.\n\nWeeks later, Cameron returns to the village and convinces Peri to lure Leela to the cabin, so that they can \"reunite\". He also kidnaps [[Zack Loveday]] (Duayne Boachie), believing him to be Daniel's father, unaware that Daniel's biological father is actually [[Louis Loveday]] ([[Karl Collins]]), Zack's father. Cameron meets Leela at the cabin, and plots to murder her for cheating on him. Meanwhile, Courtney, Tegan and Peri go to the river, where Tegan and Courtney find a dead body, which transpires to be Celine's. Cameron hears them screaming, so he locks them in a nearby shack, while hinting to Leela and Peri that he has murdered them. Cameron then holds Leela and Peri hostage and confesses to his murder. He starts setting fire to the cabin so that the three of them can die together, but they are saved by Ste and [[Ryan Knight (Hollyoaks)|Ryan Knight]] ([[Duncan James]]). After overpowering Ste, Cameron chases after Leela and Peri in the woods, where he is hit by a campervan driven by [[Mac Nightingale]] ([[David Easter]]) and [[Lisa Loveday]] ([[Rachel Adedeji]]). Lisa attempts to help Cameron, but Mac convinces her to leave him. Cameron is then arrested for committing seven murders, however is rushed to hospital for his injuries sustained by the hit-and-run. Courtney visits Cameron in hospital and allows him to see Peri, but only if he gives Zack's location. After Courtney refuses to let him see Peri, Cameron blackmails Lisa, forcing her convince Peri to visit in him prison. Meanwhile, Mac disposes of the campervan. Peri visits him and he begs her to stay in touch, but she refuses and cuts all ties with Cameron before leaving. In February 2017, Leela, Tegan, Courtney and Zack are informed that Cameron has been sentenced to life imprisonment for his crimes.\n\nTwo years later, Leela and Peri decide to visit him and later informs to Courtney that she forgives him for what he has done.\n\n==Big Bob==\n'''Robert \"Big Bob\" Gupta''', played by [[Vincent Ebrahim]], made his first on screen appearance on 8 August 2014.

Dr. S'avage is estranged from Dennis after leaving him to pursue his medical career and has been billed as pompous, as well as having changed his surname to escape from his roots. Dr. S'avage takes charge of a young team of doctors who include [[Kim Butterfield]] ([[Daisy Wood-Davis]]), [[Tegan Lomax]] (Jessica Ellis), [[#Celine McQueen|Celine McQueen]] (Sarah George) and other newcomers. Dr. S'avage's introductory storyline saw him taken hostage by [[Big Bob]] ([[Vincent Ebrahim]]).<ref name=\"newoakscastings\" /> Dr. S'avage died during the episode that aired on 20 October when, after discovering the Gloved Hand Killer's identity, he was killed by them. His exit was not announced prior to the episode's airing, making it a surprise for viewers.\n\nDr. S'avage is first mentioned by his son Dennis, and informs his cousin [[Will Savage]] (James Atherton) of how his father left him with Dirk to pursue his medical career at the time, when he was kidnapped by Will. One year later, Dr. S'avage first appears talking to Kim and it is revealed he has recently been hired to work at Dee Valley Hospital. During the hospital siege he tries to stand up to Big Bob when [[Freddie Roscoe]] ([[Charlie Clapham (actor)|Charlie Clapham]]) is shot, but he was overpowered. He then promises to help [[Lindsey Butterfield]] ([[Sophie Austin]]) get her job back. It is then revealed that he is the father of Dennis who he left in his brother, Dirk's, care when Dennis was a child so he could work abroad. Dennis and Dr. S'avage have a hard time reconciling, especially when Dr. S'avage disapproves of Dennis' transgender girlfriend [[Blessing Chambers]] ([[Modupe Adeyeye]]). Dr. S'avage then stops Dennis after he threatens to blow up [[Trevor Royle]]'s ([[Greg Wood (actor)|Greg Wood]]) flat in revenge for Trevor killing his wife, [[Leanne Holiday]] (Jessica Forrest), one year prior.\n\nDr. S'avage then reveals to Tegan that the reason her daughter [[List of Hollyoaks characters (2013)#Rose Lomax|Rose]]'s blood transfusion did not work was because  Rose was a different blood type than what Tegan was told at her birth, meaning Rose is not her biological daughter. He then informs Tegan that her cancer treatment has not worked and to [[Tony Hutchinson]] ([[Nick Pickard]]) that his cancer treatment has made him infertile. After the baby swap dilemma comes to light, the midwife who switched them, [[Mariam Andrews]] ([[Helen Lederer]]), is revealed to be Dr. S'avage's ex-wife. Mariam then blackmails Dr. S'avage into helping her, threatening to reveal a secret of his if he does not. Dr. S'avage then places Mariam in a mental ward which is witnessed by [[Sienna Blake]] ([[Anna Passey]]). Sienna then gets close to Mariam to try and uncover his secret, and Dr. S'avage, panicking, promises to get her out. Dr. S'avage is angry at his nephew Will for kidnapping Dennis two years prior, and also supports Dirk when he reveals he is being blackmailed over letting his son Will die, but Dr. S'avage tells him he has nothing to feel guilty about. He also helps him set up traps to catch the blackmailer, who is later revealed to be [[Robbie Roscoe]] ([[Charlie Wernham]]).\n\nSienna and Dr. S'avage grow closer over the following weeks, which a newly released Mariam is jealous about so she reveals Dr. S'avage's secret: he never fully qualified as a doctor. This panics Sienna as he is treating her daughter, [[Nico Blake]] ([[Persephone Swales-Dawson]]), who has a kidney infection. Dr. S'avage, however, assures her that he has never miss-diagnosed a patient and that if the truth comes out she may be deemed fit to stand trial and could end up in prison. When Mariam accuses him of killing patients, he denies it and Sienna helps destroy the evidence of him not qualifying as a doctor. When Mariam is found dead in his office after being murdered by the Gloved Hand Killer, Sienna gives him an alibi. A few weeks later, Dr. S'avage finds Sienna suffering an allergic reaction from a bee sting after Nico abandoned her and encourages Sienna to report Nico to Social Services as she needs help. Sienna agrees but later regrets her decision and has an argument with Dr. S'avage about it, before breaking down in tears. Dr. S'avage comforts her and they share a kiss. Sienna tells him later that she just sees him as a father figure, devastating him. [[Reenie McQueen]] ([[Z\u00f6e Lucker]]) then starts flirting with him to get his money, but Dr. S'avage does not believe Sienna when she tells him. After Sienna pushes Reenie down the city stairs, Dr. S'avage helps her cover it up after she admits she needed him by blackmailing Reenie over her using his credit card. He then treats Sienna's wounds after Reenie attacks her and promises to mend her wicker make of the Titanic, which Reenie also destroyed.\n\nIn August 2015, Dr. S'avage discovers that Nico murdered [[Carly Bradley]] (Sophie Wise) while protecting Sienna and tries to cover it up, but the police are called by Celine. He panics when Nico is arrested, but she is later released. He also treats [[Leela Lomax]] ([[Kirsty-Leigh Porter]]) after a car explosion and is seen outside when the Gloved Hand Killer murdered [[Dylan Jenkins]] (James Fletcher), ruling him out as a suspect. He then becomes suspicious of Dylan's death and when [[Cindy Cunningham]] ([[Stephanie Waring]]) finds the Gloved Hand Killer's locker with photos of their victims, she shares what she found with Dr. S'avage. Dr. S'avage then finds a strand of hair in the locker and orders all his staff to take a drug test in an attempt to find out who it is. However, Celine panics as she is using hospital appetite suppressants to get thin and she switches her DNA sample in order to throw the scent off her. Dr. S'avage places a camera in the drugs locker to try and catch the killer, but it fails. Later, when [[Ashley Davidson]] ([[Kierston Wareing]]) is murdered by the Gloved Hand Killer, Dr. S'avage uses the CCTV camera he placed in Ashley's room and succeedingly catches the killer. But, when advancing into the Hollyoaks Pride Festival, he calls Cindy to tell her who the killer is, unaware that the killer is behind him, armed with a syringe. Dr. S'avage is then injured when he is struck by a falling beam after Trevor shot it down by accident. In the confusion, the killer reaches Dr. S'avage and fatally injects him with a large dose of [[potassium chloride]], which was witnessed by young [[Charlie Dean]] (Charlie Behan). Dr. S'avage descends into [[cardiac arrest]] and is rushed to hospital, but dies when being resuscitated. Dirk is devastated by this as they always argued with each other. However, Cindy is adamant that the Gloved Hand Killer murdered him. Lindsey is later revealed as the killer soon after Dr. S'avage's death.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Myra-Pocahontas Savage-McQueen==\n{{Infobox soap character\n|series= Hollyoaks\n|name= Myra-Pocahontas Savage-McQueen\n|portrayed= uncredited \n|introduced= Bryan Kirkwood\n|years= 2014\u20132016\n|first= 15 October 2014\n|last= 11 March 2016\n|classification= [[List of past Hollyoaks characters#Last appeared in 2016|Former; recurring]]\n|home= [[Spain]] (2016\u2013)\n|family= [[McQueen family|McQueen]]\n|father= [[Dodger Savage]] \n|mother= [[Theresa McQueen]] \n|halfsisters= [[Nico Blake]] <br>  [[Kathleen-Angel McQueen]]\n|grandfathers= [[Patrick Blake (Hollyoaks)|Patrick Blake]] <br> [[William Alexander (Hollyoaks)|William Alexander]]\n| grandmothers= [[List of Hollyoaks characters (2013)#Anna Blake|Anna Blake]] <br> [[Kathleen McQueen]] \n|uncles= [[Will Savage]]\n|aunts= [[Mercedes McQueen]] <br> [[Jacqui McQueen]] <br> [[Sienna Blake]] <br> [[#Minnie Minniver|Minnie Minniver]]\n|nieces=  [[List of Hollyoaks characters (2018)#Victoria Blake|Victoria Blake]]\n|cousins= [[List of Hollyoaks characters (2011)|Bobby Costello]] <br> [[List of Hollyoaks characters (2017)#Sophie Blake|Sophie Blake]]<br>[[Sebastian Blake]]\n|relatives= [[Myra McQueen]] <br> [[Reenie McQueen]] <br> [[Carmel McQueen]] <br> [[John Paul McQueen]] <br> [[#Porsche McQueen|Porsche McQueen]] <br> [[#Celine McQueen|Celine McQueen]] <br> [[Cleo McQueen]] <br> [[Matthew McQueen]]\n}}\n'''Myra-Pocahontas Regina Madonna Savage-McQueen''' is a daughter of [[Dodger Savage]] ([[Danny Mac]]) and [[Theresa McQueen]] ([[Jorgie Porter]]) and half-sister of [[Nico Blake]] ([[Persephone Swales-Dawson]]) and [[Kathleen-Angel McQueen]] (Nieve Grandison).

The sisters had never confided in each other about Pete's inappropriate behaviour, which they had all experienced to varying degrees, so the extent of the danger he posed within the family was never revealed. When Pete comes back into their lives, troubled Reenie desperately wants him to stay and the girls want their mum to be in a happier place \u2013 but letting him into their home brings with it devastating consequences.\"<ref name=Sexualabuse/> ''Hollyoaks'' and child protection charity, the [[NSPCC]] have both been announced to offer support online over the course of the storyline and are set to promote a 'No Secrets' campaign, which will target to help youth find necessary help if they were to face a similar situation.<ref name=Sexualabuse/>\n\nNSPCC lead for tackling sexual abuse, Jon Brown, spoke about the upcoming storyline and sexual abuse in children: \"Well-researched storylines in soaps can help raise awareness of difficult and important issues, reaching millions of people and helping those affected reach out for support. Sexual abuse is a crime that rips apart families and I am very pleased with the way that Hollyoaks has thoughtfully approached an enormously emotive and challenging subject. Sexual abuse of children within families is disturbingly the most common form and the impact on victims is devastating, sometimes damaging them long into adulthood if they don't get the right support. Children can stay silent for fear of what speaking out will do to the relationships they have with other members of the family. Abusers may cynically use this fear to keep children silent, leaving them suffering a daily nightmare. Its important children know that help is out there and they can move forward positively.\"<ref name=Sexualabuse/> ''Hollyoaks''' executive producer, Bryan Kirkwood spoke about how viewers should be aware that [[Nana McQueen]] ([[Diane Langton]]) suffered sexual abuse within her family, and how the research that the ''Hollyoaks'' team did found that abuse can in fact infiltrate generations. He continued to speak about what he hopes to achieve: \"Her daughter Reenie is as much the victim here as her daughters in that her own childhood was filled with such unclear boundaries that she is unable to spot the markers that mean her own girls are at risk. But this is not a hopeless story \u2013 far from it. It will endeavour to show that we do have the power to stop abuse and most importantly that it is possible to recover and to go on and have a happy and successful life. The campaign 'no secrets' is a simple message that can be used to encourage adults not to ask children to keep secrets and let children know that they shouldn't have secrets either. It is the secrets kept by generations of this family that have led to what we will see play out on screen this year.\"<ref name=Sexualabuse/> It was then revealed that Nana's ex-partner, [[Derek Clough]] ([[Bruce Montague]]), was her real father as Reenie was raped by him.\n\nPorsche's final scenes were filmed on 12 November 2015, and were broadcast on 24 December 2015.

It is then revealed that he was serving time for a crime he did not commit because Leela's mother [[Sam Lomax]] ([[Lizzie Roper]]) set him up. Sam then visited him in prison before Leela ordering him not to see her otherwise she'll make sure that he will do more time. Cameron reluctantly agrees but then gets his parole moved up. Later when Sam is getting off work Cameron is seen in the back of her car and forces her to drive away from the village and scares her as revenge for what she did to him. He then reveals that he's sticking around in the village.\n\nHe gets a job as co-chef in The Hutch and befriends Leela's half-brother [[Ste Hay]] ([[Kieron Richardson]]) much to the horror of Sam and [[Danny Lomax|Danny]] ([[Stephen Billington]]). Cameron later confronts Leela about Peri asking if she's his daughter. Leela denies it at first but later tells him the truth. Terrified of Peri finding out the truth, Sam and Danny arrange to take her and their other daughter [[Tegan Lomax]] (Jessica Ellis) to New Zealand. Peri becomes depressed at this and drinks a whole bottle of wine, and she is found by Cameron, who she moans to about not wanting to leave. Later angry that Cameron's the reason their leaving, Ste confronts him, but accidentally tells Cameron their leaving. Cameron then tells Leela what Peri told him about not wanting to leave, and they confront Sam and Danny, revealing to Peri that they are her parents, much to the shock of Tegan, Ste and Peri. When Peri later goes missing Cameron goes out in the van looking for her, and accidentally smashes into Sam and Danny's car, killing them. He then flees the scene. He is present at the Lomax house the next day when Leela, Tegan, Ste and [[Ziggy Roscoe]] (Fabrizio Santino) learn of their deaths and goes with Leela to identify their bodies. Later he supports Peri when she believes her brain tumor has returned; but it's just a false alarm. He then smashes Sam's wreath just before the funeral, and strikes a deal with [[Freddie Roscoe]] ([[Charlie Clapham (actor)|Charlie Clapham]]) to plant evidence in Sam's things; including a false confession saying she killed [[Fraser Black]] ([[Jesse Birdsall]]). When Peri is furious that Leela and Tegan believe the note, she moves in with Cameron. Cameron and Ziggy later fall out over Leela, Cameron sets him up by having him drive out to the van that killed Sam and Danny, realizing what it is Ziggy tries to burn it but is arrested by police.\n\nDuring the hospital siege, Cameron sticks with Leela and tries to get into the lift to rescue Tegan and Ziggy but the lift shaft falls, much to their horror. He then protects Leela from [[#Big Bob|Big Bob]] ([[Vincent Ebrahim]]) deflecting the bullet he shot at her back at him, killing him. When his brother [[#Lockie Campbell|Lockie Campbell]] (Nick Rhys) arrives in the village, he reveals to Cameron that he's engaged, and asks him to be his best man. After the wedding train crashes, Cameron helps rescue [[Phoebe McQueen]] (Mandip Gill) from the wreckage and gets the doors open allowing the passengers to escape. Cameron then finds out from Ziggy that Tegan has cancer, so he supports her, encouraging her to tell Leela the truth. Leela then admits she has feelings for him and they begin a relationship much to Peri's delight. When the Lomaxes fall behind with their bills, Cameron breaks into The Dog to get money for them and he narrowly avoids being caught. In January 2015, he reads a text from Peri's mobile phone from her boyfriend [[Tom Cunningham]] ([[Ellis Hollins]]) and correctly assumes that they had sex. When he confronts them about it at school, they lie but a humiliated Peri stows away with Tegan and Ziggy as they prepare to go on holiday. Ziggy then phones Cameron and Leela and they go to collect her. While there Cameron eats soup laced with magic mushrooms and accidentally reveals to Leela that he killed Sam and Danny. Leela tries to call the police but she changes her mind and forces him to leave the village instead.\n\nCameron then returns weeks later when Lockie needs to raise money. He then reveals to Lockie that he killed Sam and Danny, and helps him raise the money by robbing their mother's old boyfriend. Upon his return he learns about Peri's pregnancy and Leela lets him stay for her sake. On Leela and Ziggy's wedding day he kidnaps Leela and she reveals she can never love him for what he's done - unaware that the wedding camera has recorded the whole thing. Cameron eventually lets Leela go, but is blackmailed by Tom who has seen the footage. Cameron convinces Tom to keep quiet as it would destroy Peri if she found out. Cameron starts a relationship with [[#Celine McQueen|Celine McQueen]] (Sarah George) after he helps her rob a house to raise money. He then supports her when her boss [[#Dr. Charles S'avage|Dr. Charles S'avage]] (Andrew Greenough) finds out the truth, but uncovers the truth about him being a fraud and strikes a deal with him: forget what Celine did and he will not tell anybody about his secret. Dr. S'avage agrees and Cameron uses the money he raised from the house to finance a new restaurant after Lockie caused him to lose his job. Tom later blackmails Cameron to stop Peri having their child be adopted, but Cameron refuses to do so. Tom then uploads the video of what Cameron did to the student-teacher messaging board, but changes his mind at the last minute. He forgets to however delete the video and it is accidentally sent by Ste and [[List of Hollyoaks characters (2007)#Harry Thompson|Harry Thompson]] ([[Parry Glasspool]]). Peri goes into labour after hearing the confession and Cameron, Leela and Tom help her deliver her daughter, [[List of Hollyoaks characters (2015)#Steph Cunningham-Lomax|Steph]]. Peri then calls the police on Cameron. Leela says she can help him run but Cameron refuses, and apologises to Peri and Celine and tells them he loves them, and asks Tom to look after Peri and Steph before handing himself into the police.\n\nCameron is found not guilty after Leela gives a positive character portrayal to the jury. Tegan, Peri, Ziggy and Ste are furious and disown Leela as they believe she still has feelings for Cameron after everything he has done. In December 2015, Leela and Peri decide to leave the village after Leela discovers that Ziggy and Tegan have feelings for one another. Cameron is furious as he does not know where they have gone and ends his relationship with Celine when she lies that Peri has contacted her. After Leela collects Peri from the village a few weeks later, she tells Cameron that he will never see his daughter again. This results in Cameron confessing to Lockie that he killed Sam and Danny on purpose and will kill Leela for keeping him away from Peri. After following Ziggy to Peri and Leela's new flat, he breaks in, turns all the gas on and locks all the doors while Leela is asleep and Peri is out. When Ziggy drops a present off for Peri later, he wakes Leela and she realises that there is a gas leak, so Ziggy breaks the door down and the pair escape as the building explodes; however, Ziggy hits his head as he and Leela are blown away by the explosion. He later dies from his injuries, leaving Tegan heartbroken.\n\nIn 2016, after Ste moves back in with his family, Cameron resents his presence and gets him addicted to [[crystal meth]], which he finds very difficult to overcome. Disgusted by Ste, Leela and Tegan ask him to leave, so he moves in with Harry and his father [[Tony Hutchinson]] ([[Nick Pickard]]), much to Cameron's delight. It later transpires that Cameron murdered Lockie after he discovered that Cameron caused the explosion that killed Ziggy, and this secret comes under threat by the arrival of his cousin, [[Courtney Campbell (Hollyoaks)|Courtney Campbell]] (Amy Conachan), who is desperate to find out where Lockie is. Cameron continues to lie to those he loves, including telling Courtney that he has already had Lockie cremated. Cameron is furious when he discovers that Peri's best friend, [[Nico Blake]] (Persephone Swales-Dawson) has become obsessed with her and held her hostage, and so at the \"Halloween Spooktacular\" festival, Cameron sets fire to the wooden maze where Nico and her mother, [[Sienna Blake]] ([[Anna Passey]]) are. The building is engulfed by flames, and Sienna is rescued, despite her pleas for Nico to be saved. Nico is then killed when the entire structure collapses on her, leaving Sienna distraught. Elsewhere, [[Joe Roscoe]] ([[Ayden Callaghan]]) and [[Mercedes McQueen]] ([[Jennifer Metcalfe]]) are trapped on a ferris wheel, and after Mercedes is saved, an explosion caused by the fire started by Cameron sees Joe fall from the ferris wheel, and later dying in hospital. Cameron later discovers that Celine has footage of him setting the maze on fire, but after overhearing Celine confessing to Tegan that she attempted to murder her stepfather [[Pete Buchanan]] ([[Kai Owen]]), Cameron blackmails Celine into keeping quiet.\n\nCameron begins to panic when Celine threatens to confess to the police the truth about the fire. He confronts Celine before luring her into an abandoned shed where he holds Celine hostage. Later, Cameron visits Celine where she begs him to release her, promising that she will keep quiet about the fire and that she can live with the guilt. Cameron visits Celine's boyfriend, [[Jesse Donovan]] (Luke Jerdy), and, believing Jesse to be totally oblivious to the person responsible for causing the fire, returns to Celine with the possible intention of releasing her. However, on the way to the shack, Cameron intercepts a voice message from Jesse to Celine making him realise that Jesse knows more than he was letting on. Cameron confronts Celine and tearfully tells her that he has no other way to keep her silence but to kill her, promising to make it as quick as possible before strangling her to death, and dumping her corpse in the lake. On Cameron's wedding day to Leela, she gives birth prematurely and the baby is placed in an incubator to help him breathe. Leela names the baby [[List of Hollyoaks characters (2016)#Daniel|Daniel]], after her father Danny. Cameron notices a bruise on the baby and verbally attacks the staff, believing them to be abusing Daniel but it transpires to be a [[Mongolian blue spot]], which is common in mixed race babies. Leela then reveals to Cameron that Daniel is not his son. Cameron then gives Leela an ultimatum: him or Daniel. Leela subsequently chooses Daniel, so Cameron leaves.\n\nWeeks later, Cameron returns to the village and convinces Peri to lure Leela to the cabin, so that they can \"reunite\". He also kidnaps [[Zack Loveday]] (Duayne Boachie), believing him to be Daniel's father, unaware that Daniel's biological father is actually [[Louis Loveday]] ([[Karl Collins]]), Zack's father. Cameron meets Leela at the cabin, and plots to murder her for cheating on him. Meanwhile, Courtney, Tegan and Peri go to the river, where Tegan and Courtney find a dead body, which transpires to be Celine's. Cameron hears them screaming, so he locks them in a nearby shack, while hinting to Leela and Peri that he has murdered them. Cameron then holds Leela and Peri hostage and confesses to his murder. He starts setting fire to the cabin so that the three of them can die together, but they are saved by Ste and [[Ryan Knight (Hollyoaks)|Ryan Knight]] ([[Duncan James]]). After overpowering Ste, Cameron chases after Leela and Peri in the woods, where he is hit by a campervan driven by [[Mac Nightingale]] ([[David Easter]]) and [[Lisa Loveday]] ([[Rachel Adedeji]]). Lisa attempts to help Cameron, but Mac convinces her to leave him. Cameron is then arrested for committing seven murders, however is rushed to hospital for his injuries sustained by the hit-and-run. Courtney visits Cameron in hospital and allows him to see Peri, but only if he gives Zack's location. After Courtney refuses to let him see Peri, Cameron blackmails Lisa, forcing her convince Peri to visit in him prison. Meanwhile, Mac disposes of the campervan. Peri visits him and he begs her to stay in touch, but she refuses and cuts all ties with Cameron before leaving. In February 2017, Leela, Tegan, Courtney and Zack are informed that Cameron has been sentenced to life imprisonment for his crimes.\n\nTwo years later, Leela and Peri decide to visit him and later informs to Courtney that she forgives him for what he has done.\n\n==Big Bob==\n'''Robert \"Big Bob\" Gupta''', played by [[Vincent Ebrahim]], made his first on screen appearance on 8 August 2014.

Dr. S'avage is estranged from Dennis after leaving him to pursue his medical career and has been billed as pompous, as well as having changed his surname to escape from his roots. Dr. S'avage takes charge of a young team of doctors who include [[Kim Butterfield]] ([[Daisy Wood-Davis]]), [[Tegan Lomax]] (Jessica Ellis), [[#Celine McQueen|Celine McQueen]] (Sarah George) and other newcomers. Dr. S'avage's introductory storyline saw him taken hostage by [[Big Bob]] ([[Vincent Ebrahim]]).<ref name=\"newoakscastings\" /> Dr. S'avage died during the episode that aired on 20 October when, after discovering the Gloved Hand Killer's identity, he was killed by them. His exit was not announced prior to the episode's airing, making it a surprise for viewers.\n\nDr. S'avage is first mentioned by his son Dennis, and informs his cousin [[Will Savage]] (James Atherton) of how his father left him with Dirk to pursue his medical career at the time, when he was kidnapped by Will. One year later, Dr. S'avage first appears talking to Kim and it is revealed he has recently been hired to work at Dee Valley Hospital. During the hospital siege he tries to stand up to Big Bob when [[Freddie Roscoe]] ([[Charlie Clapham (actor)|Charlie Clapham]]) is shot, but he was overpowered. He then promises to help [[Lindsey Butterfield]] ([[Sophie Austin]]) get her job back. It is then revealed that he is the father of Dennis who he left in his brother, Dirk's, care when Dennis was a child so he could work abroad. Dennis and Dr. S'avage have a hard time reconciling, especially when Dr. S'avage disapproves of Dennis' transgender girlfriend [[Blessing Chambers]] ([[Modupe Adeyeye]]). Dr. S'avage then stops Dennis after he threatens to blow up [[Trevor Royle]]'s ([[Greg Wood (actor)|Greg Wood]]) flat in revenge for Trevor killing his wife, [[Leanne Holiday]] (Jessica Forrest), one year prior.\n\nDr. S'avage then reveals to Tegan that the reason her daughter [[List of Hollyoaks characters (2013)#Rose Lomax|Rose]]'s blood transfusion did not work was because  Rose was a different blood type than what Tegan was told at her birth, meaning Rose is not her biological daughter. He then informs Tegan that her cancer treatment has not worked and to [[Tony Hutchinson]] ([[Nick Pickard]]) that his cancer treatment has made him infertile. After the baby swap dilemma comes to light, the midwife who switched them, [[Mariam Andrews]] ([[Helen Lederer]]), is revealed to be Dr. S'avage's ex-wife. Mariam then blackmails Dr. S'avage into helping her, threatening to reveal a secret of his if he does not. Dr. S'avage then places Mariam in a mental ward which is witnessed by [[Sienna Blake]] ([[Anna Passey]]). Sienna then gets close to Mariam to try and uncover his secret, and Dr. S'avage, panicking, promises to get her out. Dr. S'avage is angry at his nephew Will for kidnapping Dennis two years prior, and also supports Dirk when he reveals he is being blackmailed over letting his son Will die, but Dr. S'avage tells him he has nothing to feel guilty about. He also helps him set up traps to catch the blackmailer, who is later revealed to be [[Robbie Roscoe]] ([[Charlie Wernham]]).\n\nSienna and Dr. S'avage grow closer over the following weeks, which a newly released Mariam is jealous about so she reveals Dr. S'avage's secret: he never fully qualified as a doctor. This panics Sienna as he is treating her daughter, [[Nico Blake]] ([[Persephone Swales-Dawson]]), who has a kidney infection. Dr. S'avage, however, assures her that he has never miss-diagnosed a patient and that if the truth comes out she may be deemed fit to stand trial and could end up in prison. When Mariam accuses him of killing patients, he denies it and Sienna helps destroy the evidence of him not qualifying as a doctor. When Mariam is found dead in his office after being murdered by the Gloved Hand Killer, Sienna gives him an alibi. A few weeks later, Dr. S'avage finds Sienna suffering an allergic reaction from a bee sting after Nico abandoned her and encourages Sienna to report Nico to Social Services as she needs help. Sienna agrees but later regrets her decision and has an argument with Dr. S'avage about it, before breaking down in tears. Dr. S'avage comforts her and they share a kiss. Sienna tells him later that she just sees him as a father figure, devastating him. [[Reenie McQueen]] ([[Z\u00f6e Lucker]]) then starts flirting with him to get his money, but Dr. S'avage does not believe Sienna when she tells him. After Sienna pushes Reenie down the city stairs, Dr. S'avage helps her cover it up after she admits she needed him by blackmailing Reenie over her using his credit card. He then treats Sienna's wounds after Reenie attacks her and promises to mend her wicker make of the Titanic, which Reenie also destroyed.\n\nIn August 2015, Dr. S'avage discovers that Nico murdered [[Carly Bradley]] (Sophie Wise) while protecting Sienna and tries to cover it up, but the police are called by Celine. He panics when Nico is arrested, but she is later released. He also treats [[Leela Lomax]] ([[Kirsty-Leigh Porter]]) after a car explosion and is seen outside when the Gloved Hand Killer murdered [[Dylan Jenkins]] (James Fletcher), ruling him out as a suspect. He then becomes suspicious of Dylan's death and when [[Cindy Cunningham]] ([[Stephanie Waring]]) finds the Gloved Hand Killer's locker with photos of their victims, she shares what she found with Dr. S'avage. Dr. S'avage then finds a strand of hair in the locker and orders all his staff to take a drug test in an attempt to find out who it is. However, Celine panics as she is using hospital appetite suppressants to get thin and she switches her DNA sample in order to throw the scent off her. Dr. S'avage places a camera in the drugs locker to try and catch the killer, but it fails. Later, when [[Ashley Davidson]] ([[Kierston Wareing]]) is murdered by the Gloved Hand Killer, Dr. S'avage uses the CCTV camera he placed in Ashley's room and succeedingly catches the killer. But, when advancing into the Hollyoaks Pride Festival, he calls Cindy to tell her who the killer is, unaware that the killer is behind him, armed with a syringe. Dr. S'avage is then injured when he is struck by a falling beam after Trevor shot it down by accident. In the confusion, the killer reaches Dr. S'avage and fatally injects him with a large dose of [[potassium chloride]], which was witnessed by young [[Charlie Dean]] (Charlie Behan). Dr. S'avage descends into [[cardiac arrest]] and is rushed to hospital, but dies when being resuscitated. Dirk is devastated by this as they always argued with each other. However, Cindy is adamant that the Gloved Hand Killer murdered him. Lindsey is later revealed as the killer soon after Dr. S'avage's death.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Myra-Pocahontas Savage-McQueen==\n{{Infobox soap character\n|series= Hollyoaks\n|name= Myra-Pocahontas Savage-McQueen\n|portrayed= uncredited \n|introduced= Bryan Kirkwood\n|years= 2014\u20132016\n|first= 15 October 2014\n|last= 11 March 2016\n|classification= [[List of past Hollyoaks characters#Last appeared in 2016|Former; recurring]]\n|home= [[Spain]] (2016\u2013)\n|family= [[McQueen family|McQueen]]\n|father= [[Dodger Savage]] \n|mother= [[Theresa McQueen]] \n|halfsisters= [[Nico Blake]] <br>  [[Kathleen-Angel McQueen]]\n|grandfathers= [[Patrick Blake (Hollyoaks)|Patrick Blake]] <br> [[William Alexander (Hollyoaks)|William Alexander]]\n| grandmothers= [[List of Hollyoaks characters (2013)#Anna Blake|Anna Blake]] <br> [[Kathleen McQueen]] \n|uncles= [[Will Savage]]\n|aunts= [[Mercedes McQueen]] <br> [[Jacqui McQueen]] <br> [[Sienna Blake]] <br> [[#Minnie Minniver|Minnie Minniver]]\n|nieces=  [[List of Hollyoaks characters (2018)#Victoria Blake|Victoria Blake]]\n|cousins= [[List of Hollyoaks characters (2011)|Bobby Costello]] <br> [[List of Hollyoaks characters (2017)#Sophie Blake|Sophie Blake]]<br>[[Sebastian Blake]]\n|relatives= [[Myra McQueen]] <br> [[Reenie McQueen]] <br> [[Carmel McQueen]] <br> [[John Paul McQueen]] <br> [[#Porsche McQueen|Porsche McQueen]] <br> [[#Celine McQueen|Celine McQueen]] <br> [[Cleo McQueen]] <br> [[Matthew McQueen]]\n}}\n'''Myra-Pocahontas Regina Madonna Savage-McQueen''' is a daughter of [[Dodger Savage]] ([[Danny Mac]]) and [[Theresa McQueen]] ([[Jorgie Porter]]) and half-sister of [[Nico Blake]] ([[Persephone Swales-Dawson]]) and [[Kathleen-Angel McQueen]] (Nieve Grandison).

The sisters had never confided in each other about Pete's inappropriate behaviour, which they had all experienced to varying degrees, so the extent of the danger he posed within the family was never revealed. When Pete comes back into their lives, troubled Reenie desperately wants him to stay and the girls want their mum to be in a happier place - but letting him into their home brings with it devastating consequences.\"<ref name=Sexualabuse/> ''Hollyoaks'' and child protection charity, the [[NSPCC]] have both been announced to offer support online over the course of the storyline and are set to promote a 'No Secrets' campaign, which will target to help youth find necessary help if they were to face a similar situation.<ref name=Sexualabuse/>\n\nNSPCC lead for tackling sexual abuse, Jon Brown, spoke about the upcoming storyline and sexual abuse in children: \"Well-researched storylines in soaps can help raise awareness of difficult and important issues, reaching millions of people and helping those affected reach out for support. Sexual abuse is a crime that rips apart families and I am very pleased with the way that Hollyoaks has thoughtfully approached an enormously emotive and challenging subject. Sexual abuse of children within families is disturbingly the most common form and the impact on victims is devastating, sometimes damaging them long into adulthood if they don't get the right support. Children can stay silent for fear of what speaking out will do to the relationships they have with other members of the family. Abusers may cynically use this fear to keep children silent, leaving them suffering a daily nightmare. Its important children know that help is out there and they can move forward positively.\"<ref name=Sexualabuse/> ''Hollyoaks''' executive producer, Bryan Kirkwood spoke about how viewers should be aware that [[Nana McQueen]] ([[Diane Langton]]) suffered sexual abuse within her family, and how the research that the ''Hollyoaks'' team did found that abuse can in fact infiltrate generations. He continued to speak about what he hopes to achieve: \"Her daughter Reenie is as much the victim here as her daughters in that her own childhood was filled with such unclear boundaries that she is unable to spot the markers that mean her own girls are at risk. But this is not a hopeless story - far from it. It will endeavour to show that we do have the power to stop abuse and most importantly that it is possible to recover and to go on and have a happy and successful life. The campaign 'no secrets' is a simple message that can be used to encourage adults not to ask children to keep secrets and let children know that they shouldn't have secrets either. It is the secrets kept by generations of this family that have led to what we will see play out on screen this year.\"<ref name=Sexualabuse/> It was then revealed that Nana's ex-partner, [[Derek Clough]] ([[Bruce Montague]]), was her real father as Reenie was raped by him.\n\nPorsche's final scenes were filmed on 12 November 2015, and were broadcast on 24 December 2015.

Celine gets into trouble at the hospital when she takes the blame for Tegan performing a blood transfusion on her own daughter despite being a student nurse, but Tegan later admits the truth and Celine is cleared.

The [[Falcon 9 Full Thrust]] and [[Falcon Heavy]] variants followed in 2015 and 2018, and are both launched from [[Kennedy Space Center|Kennedy]], in addition to Cape Canaveral and Vandenberg.\n\n== Nomenclature ==\n[[Elon Musk]], CEO of SpaceX, has stated that the Falcon 1, 9, and Heavy are named after the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'' from the ''[[Star Wars]]'' film series.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwMIAKabRng |title= Joseph Gordon-Levitt at SpaceX |publisher= Youtube |page= timeindex 2:25 }}</ref>\n\n== Current launch vehicles ==\n=== Falcon 9 \"Full Thrust\" ===\n{{Main|Falcon 9 Full Thrust}}\n[[File:Crew Demo-1 Mission (39684491043).jpg|thumb|The Dragon capsule sits atop the Falcon 9 rocket before the  Demo-1 launch.]]\nThe \"Full Thrust\" version of Falcon 9 is an upgraded version of the Falcon 9 v1.1. It was used the first time on 22 December 2015 for the ORBCOMM-2 launch at Cape Canaveral SLC-40 launch pad.\n\nThe first stage was upgraded with a larger [[liquid oxygen]] tank, loaded with [[subcooled]] propellants to allow a greater mass of fuel in the same tank volume. The second stage was also extended for greater fuel tank capacity. These upgrades brought a 33% increase to the previous rocket performance.<ref>SpaceX ORBCOMM-2 webcast</ref> 5 sub-variants have been flown, only [[Falcon 9 Block 5]] is still active.\n\n=== Falcon Heavy ===\n{{Main|Falcon Heavy}}\n[[File:Falcon Heavy cropped.jpg|thumb|Falcon Heavy on pad LC-39A]]\nFalcon Heavy (FH) is a [[Super heavy-lift launch vehicle|super heavy lift space launch vehicle]] designed and manufactured by [[SpaceX]]. The Falcon Heavy is a variant of the [[Falcon 9]] launch vehicle comprising three Falcon 9 first stages: a reinforced center core, and two additional [[Modular rocket|side boosters]]. All three boosters are designed to be recovered and reused. The side boosters assigned to Falcon Heavy's first flight were recovered from two prior Falcon 9 missions.

Its stated business objective was the development of launch services for a fraction of the cost of the then-available commercial launch providers \u2013 to the greatest extent practicable, they would create reusable pieces of its launch system, thereby greatly lowering the cost of space access.  Toward that end, SpaceX sponsored the development of its own launch vehicle and engines, using a vertically integrated business model in which SpaceX would design, fabricate, prepare and operate a launch system.\n\nAlan Boyle\u2019s recent review of commercial efforts to supply the International Space Station naturally included coverage of the successful flight of SpaceX\u2019s Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon\u2019s delivery demonstration.  The article focused on the way commercial space is financed, specifically how NASA is sponsoring the development of some of these capabilities.  This financial arrangement is the basis for a point repeatedly voiced by critics of the heralded vision of \u201cNew Space\u201d replacing \u201cgovernment\u201d space \u2013 a company like SpaceX is not actually commercial in the traditional free market sense, but simply another government-funded contractor using a different procurement model.\n\nFalcon 1 was the first rocket developed by SpaceX.  It is a two-stage launch vehicle capable of putting a metric ton (1000 kg) into low Earth orbit.  Falcon 1 uses a single Merlin, a SpaceX-developed, LOX-kerosene rocket engine producing ~570,000 newtons of thrust (for comparison, a single Shuttle main engine burns LOX-hydrogen fuel and produces about 2,300,000 newtons of thrust).  The Falcon 1 was designed to put relatively small satellites into low earth orbit.  With such payload capacity, it is also capable of sending 100-200 kg microsats beyond LEO, into cislunar space.\n\nMuch of the private start-up capital for SpaceX was used to develop the Falcon 1.  They also received some government funding from other than NASA.  The Department of Defense (DoD) had need for reliable, quick, and cheap space access for small payloads.  To that end, SpaceX received funding from several DoD entities, including several million dollars from the U.S. Air Force under a program to develop launch capability for DARPA (a defense research agency).  Space X was given access to and the use of DoD launch facilities at the Reagan Test Site (formerly Kwajalein Missile Range) in the Marshall Islands.\n\nThe early days of Falcon 1 development were not pretty.  The first launch failed after 25 seconds of flight.  The second flight successfully launched and staged, but did not reach orbit.  After the third attempt at flight failed during staging, a review board looked in detail at SpaceX\u2019s launch processing stream and made recommendations for some significant changes.  The next launch was successful in putting a dummy payload into orbit.  In July 2009, six years after Falcon 1 development had begun, SpaceX achieved its first (and so far, only) commercial space success with the launch and orbit of the Malaysian RazakSAT imaging satellite on a Falcon 1 launch.\n\nTypically when a space company finally achieves a long-sought success, it moves rapidly to exploit the new vehicle\u2019s operational status and begins to aggressively market and sell its new launch service.  However, no Falcon 1 launch has occurred since the success of RazakSAT.  A visit to the SpaceX web site describes the Falcon 1 vehicle, but at the bottom of the page it states that a Falcon 1 launch is no longer available for purchase.  Instead, small, one-ton class payloads will be accommodated in the future through \u201cpiggyback\u201d rides on the new, Falcon 9 medium-class launch vehicle.\n\nFor a company to spend six years and start up money developing a needed launch system, only to abandon it just as success and profit is at hand, is difficult to sort through.  One could be forgiven for imagining that the development of the Falcon 1 as a commercial launch system was never intended but rather a pretext to flight qualify the pieces (specifically the Merlin 1 engine) used in the nine-engine cluster that powers the Falcon 9 launcher.  Interestingly, others have noted that the now-cancelled NASA Constellation Ares I launch vehicle (\u201cThe Stick\u201d), purportedly designed to launch the new Orion spacecraft to LEO, likewise appeared to be more of a development effort than a flight project, in that its various pieces (e.g., cryogenic upper stage, five-segment SRB) were all needed to build the large Ares V heavy lift rocket.\n\nMeanwhile, customers in need of low-cost options for launching small payloads are out of luck.  Falcon 9 has yet to launch an ounce of commercial payload and Falcon 1 is not for sale.  Of course, one can launch small satellites using Orbital\u2019s Taurus launch vehicle, but its ~$50-70 M cost and recent record of unreliability (e.g., the Glory satellite launch failure) engender neither comfort nor confidence.  More significantly, after investing in the R&D effort of a new, unproven company that was offering a low cost, small launch vehicle, SpaceX\u2019s original DoD customers, banking on the creation of a quick, inexpensive capability to launch small satellites, saw their support of Falcon 1 go by the board.  It appears that SpaceX dropped their initial operational vehicle for the promotion and promise of far more ambitious and distant goals.\n\nThat template seems to work for them \u2013 NASA has \u201cinvested\u201d more than $500 million in the Falcon 9 over the last five years.  Now, SpaceX holds court to advance their founder\u2019s Mars fantasies and plans for a Falcon \u201cheavy\u201d launch vehicle \u2013 designed and marketed as sending very large payloads into space, at unbelievably low prices.

Alternatively, a [[spirit level]] that exploits the buoyancy of an air bubble and its tendency to go vertically upwards may be used to test for horizontality. Modern rotary laser levels that can level themselves automatically are robust sophisticated instruments and work on the same fundamental principle.<ref>See [http://www.laser-level.co.uk/products/stabila-rotary-lasers/stabila-lar200.html Laser Levels]</ref><ref>For how a spirit level works, see http://www.physicsforums.com/showthread.php?t=562730</ref>\n\n===The flat earth approximation===\nIn the flat earth scenario,<ref>See ''Theory and Problems of Theoretical Mechanics\" by Murray R Spiegel, 1987, pg 62</ref> where the earth is notionally a large (infinite) flat surface with gravitational field at a right angle to the surface, the earth surface is horizontal and any plane parallel to the earth surface is also horizontal.  Vertical planes, e.g., walls, may be parallel to each other or they may intersect at a vertical line. Horizontal surfaces do not intersect. Furthermore, a  plane cannot both be a horizontal plane at one place and a vertical plane somewhere else.\n[[File:Vertical and Horizontal Lines.png|thumb|Vertical & Horizontal Lines]]\n\n===The spherical Earth===\n[[File:Vertical wall are never parallel.PNG|thumb|Strictly, vertical walls are never parallel on the surface of a spherical planet]]\nWhen the curvature of the earth is taken into account, the concepts of vertical and horizontal take on yet another meaning. On the surface of a smoothly spherical, homogenous, non-rotating planet, the plumb bob picks out as vertical the radial direction. Strictly speaking, it is now no longer possible for vertical walls to be parallel: ''all'' verticals intersect. This fact has real practical applications in construction and civil engineering, e.g., the tops of the towers of a suspension bridge are further apart than at the bottom. \n<ref>Encyclopedia.com. In very long bridges, it may be necessary to take the earth's curvature into account when designing the towers. For example, in the New York's Verrazano Narrows Bridge, the towers, which are 700 ft (215 m) tall and stand 4260 ft (298 m) apart, are about 1.75 in (4.5 cm) farther apart at the top than they are at the bottom.</ref> \n[[File:Horizontal planes can intersect.PNG|thumbnail|On a spherical planet, horizontal planes intersect. In the example shown, the blue line represents the tangent plane at the North pole, the red the tangent plane at an equatorial point. The two intersect at a right angle.]]\nAlso, horizontal planes can intersect when they are [[tangent]] planes to separated points on the surface of the earth. In particular, a plane tangent to a point on the equator intersects the plane tangent to the [[North Pole]] at a [[right angle]]. (See diagram).\nFurthermore, the [[equator]]ial plane is parallel to the tangent plane at the North Pole and as such has claim to be a horizontal plane. But it is. at the same time, a vertical plane for points on the equator. In this sense, a plane can, arguably, be ''both'' horizontal and vertical, horizontal ''at one place'', and vertical ''at another''.\n\n=== Further complications===\n{{Main Article|Vertical deflection}}\nFor a spinning earth, the plumb line deviates from the radial direction as a function of latitude.<ref>{{cite web|url=  http://faculty.trinityvalleyschool.org/hoseltom/handouts/Chap%2014-Ax-Plumb-bob%20Deviation%20w%20Latitude-34PbyE.pdf|title= Working in the Rotating Reference Frame of the Earth}}</ref> Only at the North and South Poles does the plumb line align with the local radius. The situation is actually even more complicated because earth is not a [[homogeneous]] smooth sphere. It is a non homogeneous, non spherical, knobby planet in motion, and the vertical not only need not lie along a radial, it may even be curved and be varying with time. On a smaller scale, a mountain to one side may deflect the plumb bob away from the true [[zenith]].<ref>Such a deflection was measured by [[Nevil Maskelyne]]. See Maskelyne, N.

By contrast, a level floor only contains horizontal lines.]] \nOn a (horizontal) floor, one can draw a horizontal line but not a vertical line in the sense of a plumb bob line. But on a (vertical) wall, one can draw both vertical ''and'' horizontal lines. In this sense, a vertical wall allows more options. This is reflected in the tools a bricklayer uses: a plumb line for verticality and a spirit level to check that the mortar courses are horizontal.\nOn the other hand, in contrast to a wall a horizontal floor allows more options when one considers compass directions. One can draw on a floor lines going north, south, east, and west, in fact, along any compass direction. A wall allows fewer options. For instance, on a wall which runs along a longitude, an insect cannot crawl east.{{who|date=March 2020}}\n\n=== Independence of horizontal and vertical motions ===\nNeglecting the curvature of the earth, horizontal and vertical motions of a projectile moving under gravity are independent of each other.<ref>Salters Hornerns Advanced Physics Project, As Student Book, Edexcel Pearson, London,  2008, p. 48.</ref> Vertical displacement of a projectile is not affected by the horizontal component of the launch velocity, and, conversely, the horizontal displacement is unaffected by the vertical component.  The notion dates at least as far back as Galileo.<ref>See Galileo's discussion of how bodies rise and fall under gravity on a moving ship in his ''Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems''(trans. S. Drake). University of California Press, Berkeley, 1967, pp. 186\u2013187.</ref>\n\nWhen the curvature of the earth is taken into account, the independence of the two motion does ''not'' hold. For example, even a projectile fired in a horizontal direction (i.e., with a zero vertical component) may leave the surface of the spherical earth and indeed escape altogether.<ref>See Harris Benson ''University Physics'', New York 1991, page 268.</ref>\n\n==Mathematical definition==\n\n===In two dimensions===\n[[File:Vertical horizontal.PNG|thumb|In two dimensions. 1. The vertical direction is designated. 2. The horizontal is normal to the vertical. Through any point P, there is exactly one vertical and exactly one horizontal. Alternatively, one can start by designating the horizontal direction.]]\n\nIn the context of a two-dimensional orthogonal [[Cartesian coordinate system]] on  a Euclidean plane, to say that a line is horizontal or vertical, an initial designation has to be made. One can start off by designating the vertical direction, usually labelled  the Y direction.<ref>For an example of identification of the ''y''-axis with the vertical, and the ''x''-axis with the horizontal, see G.S.Rehill's ''Interactive Maths Series, \"Building a Strong foundation in Mathematics\"'', accessible on http://www.mathsteacher.com.au/year8/ch15_graphs/05_hor/ver.htm.</ref> The horizontal direction, usually labelled the X direction,<ref>For a definition of \"Horizontal axis\" see Math Dictionary at http://www.icoachmath.com/math_dictionary/Horizontal_Axis.html</ref> is then automatically determined. Or, one can do it the other way around, i.e., nominate the ''x''-axis, in which case the ''y''-axis is then automatically determined. There is no special reason to choose the horizontal over the vertical as the initial designation: the two directions are on par in this respect.\n\nThe following hold in the two-dimensional case:\n# Through any point P in the plane, there is one and only one ''vertical line'' within the plane and one and only one ''horizontal line'' within the plane. This symmetry breaks down as one moves to the three-dimensional case.\n# A  ''vertical line'' is any line parallel to the vertical direction. A ''horizontal line'' is any line normal to a vertical line.\n# Horizontal lines do not cross each other.\n#Vertical lines do not cross each other.\n\nNot all of these elementary geometric facts are true in the 3-D context.\n\n===In three dimensions===\nIn the three-dimensional case, the situation is more complicated as now one has horizontal and vertical planes in addition to horizontal and vertical lines. Consider a point P and designate a direction through P as vertical. A plane which contains P and is normal to the designated direction is the ''[[horizontal plane]]'' at P. Any plane going through P, normal to the horizontal plane is a  ''[[vertical plane]]'' at P. Through any point P, there is one and only one horizontal plane but a ''multiplicity'' of vertical planes. This is a new feature that emerges in three dimensions. The symmetry that exists in the two-dimensional case no longer holds.\n\n=== In the classroom===\n[[File:Mystery of the horizontal y-axis.PNG|thumb|The ''y''-axis on the wall is vertical but the one on the table is horizontal]]\nIn the 2-dimension case, as mentioned already, the usual designation of the vertical coincides with the [[y-axis]] in co-ordinate geometry. This convention can cause confusion in the classroom. For the teacher, writing perhaps on a white board, the ''y''-axis really is  vertical in the sense of the plumbline verticality but for the student the axis may well lie on a horizontal table.\n\n==Discussion==\n{{cleanup merge|Horizontal plane}}\n{{essay-like|section|date=July 2018}}\n[[File:Bubble on a marble shelf.PNG|thumb|A spirit level on a shelf]]\n\nAlthough the word horizontal is commonly used in daily life and language (see below), it is subject to many misconceptions.\n\n* The concept of horizontality only makes sense in the context of a clearly measurable gravity field, i.e., in the 'neighborhood' of a planet, star, etc. When the gravity field becomes very weak (the masses are too small or too distant from the point of interest), the notion of being horizontal loses its meaning.\n[[File:Verticals at separate points.PNG|thumb|left|Verticals at two separate points are not parallel. The same holds for their associated horizontal planes]]\n* A plane is horizontal only at the chosen point. Horizontal planes at two separate points are not parallel, they intersect.\n* In general, a horizontal plane will only be perpendicular to a [[vertical direction]] if both are specifically defined with respect to the same point: a direction is only vertical at the point of reference. Thus both horizontality and verticality are strictly speaking local concepts, and it is always necessary to state to which location the direction or the plane refers to. Note that (1) the same restriction applies to the straight lines contained within the plane: they are horizontal only at the point of reference, and (2) those straight lines contained in the plane but not passing by the reference point are not necessarily horizontal anywhere.\n[[File:Gravitational field due to knobbly planet.PNG|thumb|field lines for a non homogeneous knobbly planet in motion may be curved. The white, red and hlue bits illustrate the planet's heterogeneity.]]\n* In reality, the gravity field of a heterogeneous planet such as [[Earth]] is deformed due to the inhomogeneous spatial distribution of materials with different [[density|densities]]. Actual horizontal planes are thus not even parallel even if their reference points are along the same vertical line, since a vertical line is slightly curved.\n* At any given location, the total gravitational force is not quite constant over [[time]], because the objects that generate the gravity are moving. For instance, on Earth the horizontal plane at a given point (as determined by a pair of [[spirit level]]s) changes with the position of the Moon (air, sea and land [[tide]]s).\n* On a rotating planet such as Earth, the strictly gravitational pull of the planet (and other celestial objects such as the Moon, the [[Sun]], etc.) is different from the apparent net force (e.g., on a free-falling object) that can be measured in the laboratory or in the field. This difference is the [[centrifugal force (fictitious)|centrifugal force]] associated with the planet's rotation. This is a [[fictitious force]]: it only arises when calculations or experiments are conducted in [[Inertial frame of reference|non-inertial frames of reference]], such as the surface of the Earth.\n\nIn general or in practice, something that is horizontal can be [[Drawing|drawn]] from left to right (or right to left), such as the x-axis in the [[Cartesian coordinate system]].{{cn|date=July 2018}}\n\n===Practical use in daily life===\n[[File:Mystery of the horizontal y-axis.PNG|thumb|The y-axis on the wall is vertical but the one on the table is horizontal.]]\nThe concept of a horizontal plane is thus anything but simple, although, in practice, most of these effects and variations are rather small: they are measurable and can be predicted with great accuracy, but they may not greatly affect our daily life.\n\nThis dichotomy between the apparent simplicity of a concept and an actual complexity of defining (and measuring) it in scientific terms arises from the fact that the typical linear scales and dimensions of relevance in daily life are 3 [[orders of magnitude]] (or more) smaller than the size of the Earth. Hence, the world appears to be flat locally, and horizontal planes in nearby locations appear to be parallel. Such statements are nevertheless approximations; whether they are acceptable in any particular context or application depends on the applicable requirements, in particular in terms of accuracy.\nIn graphical contexts, such as [[Technical drawing|drawing and drafting]] and Co-ordinate geometry on rectangular paper, it is very common to associate one of the dimensions of the paper with a horizontal, even though the entire sheet of paper is standing on a flat horizontal (or slanted) table. In this case, the horizontal direction is typically from the left side of the paper to the right side. This is purely conventional (although it is somehow 'natural' when drawing a natural scene as it is seen in reality), and may lead to misunderstandings or misconceptions, especially in an educational context.\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=23em}}\n* [[Cartesian coordinate system]]\n* [[Coordinate system]]\n* [[Horizon]]\n* [[Horizontal coordinate system]]\n* [[Local tangent plane]]\n* [[Northing and easting]]\n* [[Transverse plane]]\n* [[Vertical and horizontal (radio propagation)]]\n* [[Vertical circle]]\n* [[Vertical position]]\n* [[Zenith]]\n{{Col div end}}\n\n==References and notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Brennan, David A.; Esplen, Matthew F.; Gray, Jeremy J.

Alternatively, a [[spirit level]] that exploits the buoyancy of an air bubble and its tendency to go vertically upwards may be used to test for horizontality. Modern rotary laser levels that can level themselves automatically are robust sophisticated instruments and work on the same fundamental principle.<ref>See [http://www.laser-level.co.uk/products/stabila-rotary-lasers/stabila-lar200.html Laser Levels]</ref><ref>For how a spirit level works, see http://www.physicsforums.com/showthread.php?t=562730</ref>\n\n===The flat earth approximation===\nIn the flat earth scenario,<ref>See ''Theory and Problems of Theoretical Mechanics\" by Murray R Spiegel, 1987, pg 62</ref> where the earth is notionally a large (infinite) flat surface with gravitational field at a right angle to the surface, the earth surface is horizontal and any plane parallel to the earth surface is also horizontal.  Vertical planes, e.g., walls, may be parallel to each other or they may intersect at a vertical line. Horizontal surfaces do not intersect. Furthermore, a  plane cannot both be a horizontal plane at one place and a vertical plane somewhere else.\n[[File:Vertical and Horizontal Lines.png|thumb|Vertical & Horizontal Lines]]\n\n===The spherical Earth===\n[[File:Vertical wall are never parallel.PNG|thumb|Strictly, vertical walls are never parallel on the surface of a spherical planet]]\nWhen the curvature of the earth is taken into account, the concepts of vertical and horizontal take on yet another meaning. On the surface of a smoothly spherical, homogenous, non-rotating planet, the plumb bob picks out as vertical the radial direction. Strictly speaking, it is now no longer possible for vertical walls to be parallel: ''all'' verticals intersect. This fact has real practical applications in construction and civil engineering, e.g., the tops of the towers of a suspension bridge are further apart than at the bottom. \n<ref>Encyclopedia.com. In very long bridges, it may be necessary to take the earth's curvature into account when designing the towers. For example, in the New York's Verrazano Narrows Bridge, the towers, which are 700 ft (215 m) tall and stand 4260 ft (298 m) apart, are about 1.75 in (4.5 cm) farther apart at the top than they are at the bottom.</ref> \n[[File:Horizontal planes can intersect.PNG|thumbnail|On a spherical planet, horizontal planes intersect. In the example shown, the blue line represents the tangent plane at the North pole, the red the tangent plane at an equatorial point. The two intersect at a right angle.]]\nAlso, horizontal planes can intersect when they are [[tangent]] planes to separated points on the surface of the earth. In particular, a plane tangent to a point on the equator intersects the plane tangent to the [[North Pole]] at a [[right angle]]. (See diagram).\nFurthermore, the [[equator]]ial plane is parallel to the tangent plane at the North Pole and as such has claim to be a horizontal plane. But it is. at the same time, a vertical plane for points on the equator. In this sense, a plane can, arguably, be ''both'' horizontal and vertical, horizontal ''at one place'', and vertical ''at another''.\n\n=== Further complications===\n{{Main Article|Vertical deflection}}\nFor a spinning earth, the plumb line deviates from the radial direction as a function of latitude.<ref>{{cite web|url=  http://faculty.trinityvalleyschool.org/hoseltom/handouts/Chap%2014-Ax-Plumb-bob%20Deviation%20w%20Latitude-34PbyE.pdf|title= Working in the Rotating Reference Frame of the Earth}}</ref> Only at the North and South Poles does the plumb line align with the local radius. The situation is actually even more complicated because earth is not a [[homogeneous]] smooth sphere. It is a non homogeneous, non spherical, knobby planet in motion, and the vertical not only need not lie along a radial, it may even be curved and be varying with time. On a smaller scale, a mountain to one side may deflect the plumb bob away from the true [[zenith]].<ref>Such a deflection was measured by [[Nevil Maskelyne]]. See Maskelyne, N. (1775). \"An Account of Observations Made on the Mountain Schiehallion for Finding Its Attraction\". Phil. Trans. Royal Soc. 65 (0): 500\u2013542. doi:10.1098/rstl.1775.0050.

By contrast, a level floor only contains horizontal lines.]] \nOn a (horizontal) floor, one can draw a horizontal line but not a vertical line in the sense of a plumb bob line. But on a (vertical) wall, one can draw both vertical ''and'' horizontal lines. In this sense, a vertical wall allows more options. This is reflected in the tools a bricklayer uses: a plumb line for verticality and a spirit level to check that the mortar courses are horizontal.\nOn the other hand, in contrast to a wall a horizontal floor allows more options when one considers compass directions. One can draw on a floor lines going north, south, east, and west, in fact, along any compass direction. A wall allows fewer options. For instance, on a wall which runs along a longitude, an insect cannot crawl east.{{who|date=March 2020}}\n\n=== Independence of horizontal and vertical motions ===\nNeglecting the curvature of the earth, horizontal and vertical motions of a projectile moving under gravity are independent of each other.<ref>Salters Hornerns Advanced Physics Project, As Student Book, Edexcel Pearson, London,  2008, p. 48.</ref> Vertical displacement of a projectile is not affected by the horizontal component of the launch velocity, and, conversely, the horizontal displacement is unaffected by the vertical component.  The notion dates at least as far back as Galileo.<ref>See Galileo's discussion of how bodies rise and fall under gravity on a moving ship in his ''Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems''(trans. S. Drake). University of California Press, Berkeley, 1967, pp. 186\u2013187.</ref>\n\nWhen the curvature of the earth is taken into account, the independence of the two motion does ''not'' hold. For example, even a projectile fired in a horizontal direction (i.e., with a zero vertical component) may leave the surface of the spherical earth and indeed escape altogether.<ref>See Harris Benson ''University Physics'', New York 1991, page 268.</ref>\n\n==Mathematical definition==\n\n===In two dimensions===\n[[File:Vertical horizontal.PNG|thumb|In two dimensions. 1. The vertical direction is designated. 2. The horizontal is normal to the vertical. Through any point P, there is exactly one vertical and exactly one horizontal. Alternatively, one can start by designating the horizontal direction.]]\n\nIn the context of a two-dimensional orthogonal [[Cartesian coordinate system]] on  a Euclidean plane, to say that a line is horizontal or vertical, an initial designation has to be made. One can start off by designating the vertical direction, usually labelled  the Y direction.<ref>For an example of identification of the ''y''-axis with the vertical, and the ''x''-axis with the horizontal, see G.S.Rehill's ''Interactive Maths Series, \"Building a Strong foundation in Mathematics\"'', accessible on http://www.mathsteacher.com.au/year8/ch15_graphs/05_hor/ver.htm.</ref> The horizontal direction, usually labelled the X direction,<ref>For a definition of \"Horizontal axis\" see Math Dictionary at http://www.icoachmath.com/math_dictionary/Horizontal_Axis.html</ref> is then automatically determined. Or, one can do it the other way around, i.e., nominate the ''x''-axis, in which case the ''y''-axis is then automatically determined. There is no special reason to choose the horizontal over the vertical as the initial designation: the two directions are on par in this respect.\n\nThe following hold in the two-dimensional case:\n# Through any point P in the plane, there is one and only one ''vertical line'' within the plane and one and only one ''horizontal line'' within the plane. This symmetry breaks down as one moves to the three-dimensional case.\n# A  ''vertical line'' is any line parallel to the vertical direction. A ''horizontal line'' is any line normal to a vertical line.\n# Horizontal lines do not cross each other.\n#Vertical lines do not cross each other.\n\nNot all of these elementary geometric facts are true in the 3-D context.\n\n===In three dimensions===\nIn the three-dimensional case, the situation is more complicated as now one has horizontal and vertical planes in addition to horizontal and vertical lines. Consider a point P and designate a direction through P as vertical. A plane which contains P and is normal to the designated direction is the ''[[horizontal plane]]'' at P. Any plane going through P, normal to the horizontal plane is a  ''[[vertical plane]]'' at P. Through any point P, there is one and only one horizontal plane but a ''multiplicity'' of vertical planes. This is a new feature that emerges in three dimensions. The symmetry that exists in the two-dimensional case no longer holds.\n\n=== In the classroom===\n[[File:Mystery of the horizontal y-axis.PNG|thumb|The ''y''-axis on the wall is vertical but the one on the table is horizontal]]\nIn the 2-dimension case, as mentioned already, the usual designation of the vertical coincides with the [[y-axis]] in co-ordinate geometry. This convention can cause confusion in the classroom. For the teacher, writing perhaps on a white board, the ''y''-axis really is  vertical in the sense of the plumbline verticality but for the student the axis may well lie on a horizontal table.\n\n==Discussion==\n{{cleanup merge|Horizontal plane}}\n{{essay-like|section|date=July 2018}}\n[[File:Bubble on a marble shelf.PNG|thumb|A spirit level on a shelf]]\n\nAlthough the word horizontal is commonly used in daily life and language (see below), it is subject to many misconceptions.\n\n* The concept of horizontality only makes sense in the context of a clearly measurable gravity field, i.e., in the 'neighborhood' of a planet, star, etc. When the gravity field becomes very weak (the masses are too small or too distant from the point of interest), the notion of being horizontal loses its meaning.\n[[File:Verticals at separate points.PNG|thumb|left|Verticals at two separate points are not parallel. The same holds for their associated horizontal planes]]\n* A plane is horizontal only at the chosen point. Horizontal planes at two separate points are not parallel, they intersect.\n* In general, a horizontal plane will only be perpendicular to a [[vertical direction]] if both are specifically defined with respect to the same point: a direction is only vertical at the point of reference. Thus both horizontality and verticality are strictly speaking local concepts, and it is always necessary to state to which location the direction or the plane refers to. Note that (1) the same restriction applies to the straight lines contained within the plane: they are horizontal only at the point of reference, and (2) those straight lines contained in the plane but not passing by the reference point are not necessarily horizontal anywhere.\n[[File:Gravitational field due to knobbly planet.PNG|thumb|field lines for a non homogeneous knobbly planet in motion may be curved. The white, red and hlue bits illustrate the planet's heterogeneity.]]\n* In reality, the gravity field of a heterogeneous planet such as [[Earth]] is deformed due to the inhomogeneous spatial distribution of materials with different [[density|densities]]. Actual horizontal planes are thus not even parallel even if their reference points are along the same vertical line, since a vertical line is slightly curved.\n* At any given location, the total gravitational force is not quite constant over [[time]], because the objects that generate the gravity are moving. For instance, on Earth the horizontal plane at a given point (as determined by a pair of [[spirit level]]s) changes with the position of the Moon (air, sea and land [[tide]]s).\n* On a rotating planet such as Earth, the strictly gravitational pull of the planet (and other celestial objects such as the Moon, the [[Sun]], etc.) is different from the apparent net force (e.g., on a free-falling object) that can be measured in the laboratory or in the field. This difference is the [[centrifugal force (fictitious)|centrifugal force]] associated with the planet's rotation. This is a [[fictitious force]]: it only arises when calculations or experiments are conducted in [[Inertial frame of reference|non-inertial frames of reference]], such as the surface of the Earth.\n\nIn general or in practice, something that is horizontal can be [[Drawing|drawn]] from left to right (or right to left), such as the x-axis in the [[Cartesian coordinate system]].{{cn|date=July 2018}}\n\n===Practical use in daily life===\n[[File:Mystery of the horizontal y-axis.PNG|thumb|The y-axis on the wall is vertical but the one on the table is horizontal.]]\nThe concept of a horizontal plane is thus anything but simple, although, in practice, most of these effects and variations are rather small: they are measurable and can be predicted with great accuracy, but they may not greatly affect our daily life.\n\nThis dichotomy between the apparent simplicity of a concept and an actual complexity of defining (and measuring) it in scientific terms arises from the fact that the typical linear scales and dimensions of relevance in daily life are 3 [[orders of magnitude]] (or more) smaller than the size of the Earth. Hence, the world appears to be flat locally, and horizontal planes in nearby locations appear to be parallel. Such statements are nevertheless approximations; whether they are acceptable in any particular context or application depends on the applicable requirements, in particular in terms of accuracy.\nIn graphical contexts, such as [[Technical drawing|drawing and drafting]] and Co-ordinate geometry on rectangular paper, it is very common to associate one of the dimensions of the paper with a horizontal, even though the entire sheet of paper is standing on a flat horizontal (or slanted) table. In this case, the horizontal direction is typically from the left side of the paper to the right side. This is purely conventional (although it is somehow 'natural' when drawing a natural scene as it is seen in reality), and may lead to misunderstandings or misconceptions, especially in an educational context.\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=23em}}\n* [[Cartesian coordinate system]]\n* [[Coordinate system]]\n* [[Horizon]]\n* [[Horizontal coordinate system]]\n* [[Local tangent plane]]\n* [[Northing and easting]]\n* [[Transverse plane]]\n* [[Vertical and horizontal (radio propagation)]]\n* [[Vertical circle]]\n* [[Vertical position]]\n* [[Zenith]]\n{{Col div end}}\n\n==References and notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Brennan, David A.; Esplen, Matthew F.; Gray, Jeremy J.
