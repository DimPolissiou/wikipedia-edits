It is the administrative centre of the [[Lovech Province]] and of the subordinate [[Lovech Municipality]]. The city is located about {{convert|150|km|0|abbr=off}} northeast from the capital city of [[Sofia]]. Near Lovech are the towns of [[Pleven]], [[Troyan]] and [[Teteven]].\n\n==Name==\nThe name is  possibly derived from the Slavic root ''lov'', \"hunting\" + the Slavic suffix ''-ech''.\n==Geography==\nLovech is situated in the [[Balkan Mountains|Forebalkan]] area of northern Bulgaria, on both sides of the river [[Osam]], and unifies both mountainous and plain relief. The eastern part of the town is surrounded by a 250 m high plateau, where the largest park in Lovech, ''Stratesh'', is located, and the southwestern part is surrounded by the hills ''Hisarya'' and ''Bash Bunar''. In the northwest the relief gradually changes to the plains of the neighbouring [[Pleven Province]]. The average altitude of Lovech is about 200 m above [[mean sea level]].   The highest point of the town is ''Akbair Hill'' at 450 m.\n\nIn Stratesh Park, the highest place in the town, there are a great number of lilac bushes, easily seen from the whole town, which are a wonderful view in the spring. Due to this, Lovech is well known as the town of the [[lilac]]s.\n\n==Population==\nAccording to the census, held in February, 2011, Lovech is populated by 36,600 inhabitants within city limits. In the 1880s the population of Lovech numbered about 7,000.<ref name=\"BAN\"/> Since then it started growing decade by decade, mostly because of the migrants from the rural areas and the surrounding  smaller towns, with a peak in the period 1987-1991 when exceeded 50,000 residents.<ref name=\"pop1992\"/> After this time, the population has started decreasing rapidly in consequence of the poor economic situation in the Bulgarian provinces during the 1990s that led to a new migration in the direction of the country capital Sofia and abroad.\n\n<!--THIS TABLE IS STANDARD TO ALL BULGARIAN CITIES ARTICLES.

Traces of human activities from very ancient times were found in the region, mainly in the caves near the town. The reason was the comfortable location between the mountains and the flat country, and the presence of a river.\n\nThe first inhabitants of the town were the [[Thracians|Thracian]] tribe of the Meldi{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}, whose traces date back to the 4th or 3rd centuries BC. They founded their capital, called ''Melta''{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}, in the area, which was situated at the place of today's neighbourhood and architecture reserve ''Varosha''. Later, when the Balkans were occupied by the [[Roman Empire]], a military station called ''Prezidium'' was founded near the modern town, which was situated at an important strategic position on one of the main Roman roads. Parts of this road are to be seen in the territory of Lovech today.\n\n===Middle Ages===\nThe former Roman citadel Hisarya, which is situated on the hill of the same name, was the place where in 1187 the peace treaty between the [[Bulgarian Empire]] and the [[Byzantine Empire]] was signed and the returning of Bulgaria on the European map was officially declared, marking the beginning of the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]]. In the 12th century Lovech was a great trade centre and one of the most famous towns in Bulgaria.\n\n[[File:Lovech Fortress Plan.png|thumb|280px|Plan of the medieval fortress of Lovech]]\nThe Turkish invasion in the middle of the 14th century did not pass the town, but the Hisarya fortress was captured last of all, in 1446, although for a long time after that the town enjoyed some privileges such as a prohibition on Turkish people to settle in the town or to take Bulgarian children as [[janissaries]].\n\n===Ottoman rule===\nIn the 17th century Lovech (''Lof\u00e7a'' in [[Turkish language|Turkish]]) was once again an important trade centre and one of the richest towns in Bulgaria, a reason for the town being called ''Alt\u0131n Lof\u00e7a'' (''Golden Lovech'', from [[Turkish language|Turkish]]) at the time.\n\nIn the times of revolutionary organisations against the Ottoman rule, Lovech was the centre of operations of the [[Internal Revolutionary Organisation]] of [[Vasil Levski]], called the ''Secret Revolutionary Committee''. He was arrested by the Turkish military in a village near Lovech called [[Kakrina]] and later hanged in [[Sofia]]. The biggest museum of Vasil Levski in Bulgaria containing\nmany personal items such as notebooks, clothes and weapon is situated in the old town part of Lovech.\n\nBetween 1872 and 1874, the Bulgarian master-builder Nikola Fichev, known also as [[Kolyu Ficheto]], built the famous [[Covered Bridge, Lovech|Covered Bridge]] (\u041f\u043e\u043a\u0440\u0438\u0442 \u043c\u043e\u0441\u0442) over the river Osam, the only one of its kind in the [[Balkans]]. The bridge was burned out in 1925, but rebuilt in 1931. Now it connects the new and the old part of the town and it's full of cafes, small restaurants and many souvenir shops.\n\nDuring the [[Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78]], an important battle was held at Lovech, known as the [[Battle of Lovcha]]. The war and several [[Epidemic|plagues]] and migrations in [[Wallachia]] drastically reduced the population.  There was a substantial number of victims from the Bulgarian population. Many Turkish families were expelled by the Russian army and the Muslims of Lovech known to be \"Lof\u00e7al\u0131lar\" have immigrated to several parts of Turkey (mainly [[Istanbul]], [[Edirne]] and [[Bursa]]).\n\n===Modern times===\nIn more recent times, Lovech was the place where modern foreign language education in Bulgaria started. Taking over from the American college{{which|date=January 2017}} established there in 1881,{{fact|date=January 2017}} the first foreign language school{{which|date=January 2017}} in Bulgaria was set up in Lovech in 1950.{{fact|date=January 2017}} Initially three languages were taught in this school: English, French and German. However soon after that the teaching of English and French was moved to Sofia and Varna respectively,{{fact|date=January 2017}} founding the first language schools in these cities: the [[First English Language School]] in Sofia in 1954 and the French Language School in Varna in 1958. Since for the period 1959-1984 German was the only language taught, the school in Lovech was informally known as The German School (\u041d\u0435\u043c\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0433\u0438\u043c\u043d\u0430\u0437\u0438\u044f).{{fact|date=January 2017}}\n\n==Economy==\nOn April 9, 2009, [[Great Wall Motor]] and the Bulgarian company [[Litex Motors]] signed a contract for building a production base that would manufacture three models of the Chinese manufacturer near Lovech. The new plant was opened on February 21, 2012.\n\nThe investment is worth around 97 million euros and will create 2,000 new jobs over the first four years. It will be Great Wall Motor's gate of entering the [[European Union]] market, thanks to the zero tariff levels.<ref>{{in lang|en}}

In the 1880s the population of Lovech numbered about 7,000.<ref name=\"BAN\"/> Since then it started growing decade by decade, mostly because of the migrants from the rural areas and the surrounding  smaller towns, with a peak in the period 1987-1991 when exceeded 50,000 residents.<ref name=\"pop1992\"/> After this time, the population has started decreasing rapidly in consequence of the poor economic situation in the Bulgarian provinces during the 1990s that led to a new migration in the direction of the country capital Sofia and abroad.\n\n<!--THIS TABLE IS STANDARD TO ALL BULGARIAN CITIES ARTICLES.

Traces of human activities from very ancient times were found in the region, mainly in the caves near the town. The reason was the comfortable location between the mountains and the flat country, and the presence of a river.\n\nThe first inhabitants of the town were the [[Thracians|Thracian]] tribe of the Meldi{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}, whose traces date back to the 4th or 3rd centuries BC. They founded their capital, called ''Melta''{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}, in the area, which was situated at the place of today's neighbourhood and architecture reserve ''Varosha''. Later, when the Balkans were occupied by the [[Roman Empire]], a military station called ''Prezidium'' was founded near the modern town, which was situated at an important strategic position on one of the main Roman roads. Parts of this road are to be seen in the territory of Lovech today.\n\n===Middle Ages===\nThe former Roman citadel Hisarya, which is situated on the hill of the same name, was the place where in 1187 the peace treaty between the [[Bulgarian Empire]] and the [[Byzantine Empire]] was signed and the returning of Bulgaria on the European map was officially declared, marking the beginning of the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]]. In the 12th century Lovech was a great trade centre and one of the most famous towns in Bulgaria.\n\n[[File:Lovech Fortress Plan.png|thumb|280px|Plan of the medieval fortress of Lovech]]\nThe Turkish invasion in the middle of the 14th century did not pass the town, but the Hisarya fortress was captured last of all, in 1446, although for a long time after that the town enjoyed some privileges such as a prohibition on Turkish people to settle in the town or to take Bulgarian children as [[janissaries]].\n\n===Ottoman rule===\nIn the 17th century Lovech (''Lof\u00e7a'' in [[Turkish language|Turkish]]) was once again an important trade centre and one of the richest towns in Bulgaria, a reason for the town being called ''Alt\u0131n Lof\u00e7a'' (''Golden Lovech'', from [[Turkish language|Turkish]]) at the time.\n\nIn the times of revolutionary organisations against the Ottoman rule, Lovech was the centre of operations of the [[Internal Revolutionary Organisation]] of [[Vasil Levski]], called the ''Secret Revolutionary Committee''. He was arrested by the Turkish military in a village near Lovech called [[Kakrina]] and later hanged in [[Sofia]]. The biggest museum of Vasil Levski in Bulgaria containing\nmany personal items such as notebooks, clothes and weapon is situated in the old town part of Lovech.\n\nBetween 1872 and 1874, the Bulgarian master-builder Nikola Fichev, known also as [[Kolyu Ficheto]], built the famous [[Covered Bridge, Lovech|Covered Bridge]] (\u041f\u043e\u043a\u0440\u0438\u0442 \u043c\u043e\u0441\u0442) over the river Osam, the only one of its kind in the [[Balkans]]. The bridge was burned out in 1925, but rebuilt in 1931. Now it connects the new and the old part of the town and it's full of cafes, small restaurants and many souvenir shops.\n\nDuring the [[Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78]], an important battle was held at Lovech, known as the [[Battle of Lovcha]]. The war and several [[Epidemic|plagues]] and migrations in [[Wallachia]] drastically reduced the population.  There was a substantial number of victims from the Bulgarian population. Many Turkish families were expelled by the Russian army and the Muslims of Lovech known to be \"Lof\u00e7al\u0131lar\" have immigrated to several parts of Turkey (mainly [[Istanbul]], [[Edirne]] and [[Bursa]]).\n\n===Modern times===\nIn more recent times, Lovech was the place where modern foreign language education in Bulgaria started. Taking over from the American college{{which|date=January 2017}} established there in 1881,{{fact|date=January 2017}} the first foreign language school{{which|date=January 2017}} in Bulgaria was set up in Lovech in 1950.{{fact|date=January 2017}} Initially three languages were taught in this school: English, French and German. However soon after that the teaching of English and French was moved to Sofia and Varna respectively,{{fact|date=January 2017}} founding the first language schools in these cities: the [[First English Language School]] in Sofia in 1954 and the French Language School in Varna in 1958. Since for the period 1959-1984 German was the only language taught, the school in Lovech was informally known as The German School (\u041d\u0435\u043c\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0433\u0438\u043c\u043d\u0430\u0437\u0438\u044f).{{fact|date=January 2017}}\n\n==Economy==\nOn April 9, 2009, [[Great Wall Motor]] and the Bulgarian company [[Litex Motors]] signed a contract for building a production base that would manufacture three models of the Chinese manufacturer near Lovech. The new plant was opened on February 21, 2012.\n\nThe investment is worth around 97 million euros and will create 2,000 new jobs over the first four years. It will be Great Wall Motor's gate of entering the [[European Union]] market, thanks to the zero tariff levels.<ref>{{in lang|en}}

At the end of 2018 its population is 96,610. \n\nInternationally known for the [[Siege of Plevna]] of 1877, it is today a major economic centre of the Bulgarian Northwest and Central North and the third largest city of Northern Bulgaria after [[Varna]] and [[Ruse, Bulgaria|Ruse]].\n\n==Name==\nThe name comes from the [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] word ''plevnya'' (\"barn\") or from ''plevel'', meaning \"weed\", sharing the same root, and the Slavic [[suffix]] ''-en''.\n\n==Geography==\n\nPleven is in an agricultural region in the middle of the [[Danubian Plain (Bulgaria)|Danubian Plain]], the historical region of [[Moesia]], surrounded by low limestone hills, the Pleven Heights. The city's central location in Northern Bulgaria defines its importance as a big administrative, economic, political, cultural and transport centre. Pleven is {{convert|170|km|0|abbr=off}} away from the capital city of [[Sofia]], {{convert|320|km|0|abbr=in}} west of the [[Bulgarian Black Sea Coast]] and {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=in}} south of the [[Danube]].\n\nThe river [[Vit]] flows near the city and the tiny Tuchenitsa river (commonly known in Pleven as ''Barata'', literally ''\"The Streamlet\"'') crosses it.\n\n===Climate===\nPleven's climate is temperate continental. Winters are cool, with much snow: temperatures usually fall below {{convert|-20|C|F|0}} overnight. Springs are warm, with temperatures around {{convert|20|C|F|0}}. Summers are warm, and temperatures have exceeded {{convert|38|-|44|C|F|0}} on occasion. The average annual temperature is around {{convert|13|C|F|1}}.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Pleven, Bulgaria\n|single line = Yes\n|metric first = Yes\n\n|Jan record high C = 22.8\n|Feb record high C = 24.0\n|Mar record high C = 31.2\n|Apr record high C = 35.1\n|May record high C = 37.5\n|Jun record high C = 38.4\n|Jul record high C = 44\n|Aug record high C = 41.8\n|Sep record high C = 40.8\n|Oct record high C = 38.3\n|Nov record high C = 28.8\n|Dec record high C = 23.4\n|year record high C = 44\n\n|Jan high C = 1.3\n|Feb high C = 4.6\n|Mar high C = 10.3\n|Apr high C = 18.1\n|May high C = 23.1\n|Jun high C = 26.7\n|Jul high C = 29.3\n|Aug high C = 29.4\n|Sep high C = 25.4\n|Oct high C = 18.2\n|Nov high C = 10.5\n|Dec high C = 4.1\n|year high C = 16.8\n\n|Jan mean C = -2.2\n|Feb mean C = 0.6\n|Mar mean C = 5.4\n|Apr mean C = 12.5\n|May mean C = 17.4\n|Jun mean C = 21.0\n|Jul mean C = 23.4\n|Aug mean C = 22.9\n|Sep mean C = 18.6\n|Oct mean C = 12.4\n|Nov mean C = 6.4\n|Dec mean C = 0.7\n|year mean C = 11.6\n\n|Jan low C = -5.5\n|Feb low C = -3.3\n|Mar low C = 0.9\n|Apr low C = 6.8\n|May low C = 11.5\n|Jun low C = 14.8\n|Jul low C = 16.7\n|Aug low C = 16.1\n|Sep low C = 12.3\n|Oct low C = 7.2\n|Nov low C = 2.9\n|Dec low C = -2.0\n|year low C = 6.5\n\n|Jan record low C = -29.3\n|Feb record low C = -22.2\n|Mar record low C = -18.9\n|Apr record low C = -5.7\n|May record low C = 0.6\n|Jun record low C = 3.4\n|Jul record low C = 8.7\n|Aug record low C = 8.9\n|Sep record low C = -0.6\n|Oct record low C = -6.5\n|Nov record low C = -20.4\n|Dec record low C = -24\n|year record low C = -29.3\n\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 39\n|Feb precipitation mm = 34\n|Mar precipitation mm = 33\n|Apr precipitation mm = 52\n|May precipitation mm = 68\n|Jun precipitation mm = 81\n|Jul precipitation mm = 63\n|Aug precipitation mm = 40\n|Sep precipitation mm = 38\n|Oct precipitation mm = 44\n|Nov precipitation mm = 45\n|Dec precipitation mm = 41\n|year precipitation mm = 578\n|source 1 = Stringmeteo<ref name=Stringmeteo>\n{{cite web\n|url =http://www.stringmeteo.com/synop/bg_climate.php#15528 |title =Stringmeteo&nbsp;\u2013 Pleven Climate\n|publisher=Stringmeteo\n|year=2011\n|accessdate=June 20, 2012\n}}</ref>\n|date=June 2012\n}}\n\n==History==\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2012}}\n\n===Prehistory and antiquity===\nThe earliest traces of human settlement in the area date from the [[5th millennium BC]], the [[Neolithic]].\n[[File:Pleven Antistene 4.jpg|left|thumb|The central streets of Pleven]]\n\nNumerous archaeological findings, among them the Nikolaevo treasure found in [[Bulgaria]], evidence for the rich culture of the [[Thracians]], who inhabited the area for thousands of years.\n\nIn the beginning of the new era, the region became part of the [[Roman province]] of [[Moesia]], and a road station called [[Storgosia]] arose near present-day Pleven on the road from [[Oescus]] (near modern [[Gigen]]) to [[Plovdiv|Philippopolis]] (now [[Plovdiv]]). It later evolved into a [[fortress]]. One of the most valued archaeological monuments in Bulgaria from the period is the [[Early Christian]] basilica from the fourth century discovered near the modern city.\n\n===Middle Ages===\n[[File:Pleven TodorBozhinov October 2009 (1).jpg|right|thumb|[[Pleven Regional Historical Museum]]]]\nDuring the [[Middle Ages]], Pleven was a well-developed stronghold of the [[First Bulgarian Empire|First]] and the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]]. When [[Slavs]] populated the region, they gave the settlement its contemporary name ''Pleven'', it was first mentioned in a charter by [[List of Hungarian rulers|Hungarian king]] [[Stephen V of Hungary|Stephen V]] in 1270 in connection to a military campaign in the Bulgarian lands.\n\n===Ottoman rule===\nDuring the [[History of Ottoman Bulgaria|Ottoman rule]], Pleven, known as ''Plevne'' in [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]], preserved its Bulgarian appearance and culture. Many churches, schools and bridges were built at the time of the [[Bulgarian National Revival]]. In 1825, the first secular school in the town was opened, followed by the first girls' school in Bulgaria in 1840, as well as the first boys' school a year later. Pleven was the place where the Bulgarian [[Folk hero|national hero]] [[Vasil Levski]] established the first revolutionary committee in 1869, part of [[Internal Revolutionary Organisation|his national revolutionary network]].\n\n===Siege of Plevna===\n{{main article|Siege of Plevna}}\nThe city (then mostly known as Plevna outside Bulgaria) was a [[Siege of Plevna|major battle scene]] during the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877-78|Russo-Turkish War]] of 1877\u20131878 that Russian [[Tsar]] [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] held for the purpose of the liberation of Bulgaria. The joint [[Russia]]n and [[Romania]]n army paid dearly for the victory, but it paved the path to the defeat of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in this war, the restoration of Bulgaria as a state and the independence of Romania from the Ottoman Empire. It cost the Russians and Romanians 5 months and 38,000 casualties to take the town after four assaults, in what was one of the decisive battles of the war. The siege is remembered as a landmark victory of the [[Romanian War of Independence]], as on 28 November 1877 the Plevna citadel capitulated, and Osman Pasha surrendered the city, the garrison and his sword to the Romanian Colonel [[Mihail Cerchez]].\n[[File:Pleven-Panorama-outside.JPG|thumb|right|[[Pleven Panorama]], one of the town's best known sights]]\n\nIn the [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition|''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'' Eleventh Edition]] of 1911 [[s:Author:John Henry Verinder Crowe|J.H.V.

The town experienced significant demographic and economic growth in the following years, gradually establishing itself as a cultural centre of the region.\n\nThe [[Bulgarian Agrarian National Union]], a leading [[interwar]] party representing the Bulgarian peasantry, was founded in the town in December 1899.\n\nPrior to the Bulgarian [[orthographic reform]] of 1945, the name of the town was spelled \u041f\u043b\u0463\u0432\u0435\u043d\u044a (with [[yat]]) in [[Cyrillic]].\n\n==Population==\n[[File:Pleven Town Hall Todor Bozhinov.jpg|thumb|right|The town hall of Pleven]]\nAccording to census 2011, Pleven has a population of 106,954 inhabitants as of February 2011.<ref name=\"cities census 2011\">{{in lang|bg}}[http://www.nsi.bg/census2011/pagebg2.php?p2=36&sp2=37&SSPP2=45 National Statistical Institute - Main Towns Census 2014] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110408064046/http://www.nsi.bg/census2011/pagebg2.php?p2=36&sp2=37&SSPP2=45 |date=8 April 2011 }}</ref> The ethnic breakdown is 97% [[Bulgarians]] among others.

Located in the northern part of the country, it is the administrative centre of [[Pleven Province]], as well as of the subordinate [[Pleven municipality]]. It is the biggest economic center in Northwestern Bulgaria. At the end of 2018 its population is 96,610. \n\nInternationally known for the [[Siege of Plevna]] of 1877, it is today a major economic centre of the Bulgarian Northwest and Central North and the third largest city of Northern Bulgaria after [[Varna]] and [[Ruse, Bulgaria|Ruse]].\n\n==Name==\nThe name comes from the [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] word ''plevnya'' (\"barn\") or from ''plevel'', meaning \"weed\", sharing the same root, and the Slavic [[suffix]] ''-en''.\n\n==Geography==\n\nPleven is in an agricultural region in the middle of the [[Danubian Plain (Bulgaria)|Danubian Plain]], the historical region of [[Moesia]], surrounded by low limestone hills, the Pleven Heights. The city's central location in Northern Bulgaria defines its importance as a big administrative, economic, political, cultural and transport centre. Pleven is {{convert|170|km|0|abbr=off}} away from the capital city of [[Sofia]], {{convert|320|km|0|abbr=in}} west of the [[Bulgarian Black Sea Coast]] and {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=in}} south of the [[Danube]].\n\nThe river [[Vit]] flows near the city and the tiny Tuchenitsa river (commonly known in Pleven as ''Barata'', literally ''\"The Streamlet\"'') crosses it.\n\n===Climate===\nPleven's climate is temperate continental. Winters are cool, with much snow: temperatures usually fall below {{convert|-20|C|F|0}} overnight. Springs are warm, with temperatures around {{convert|20|C|F|0}}. Summers are warm, and temperatures have exceeded {{convert|38|-|44|C|F|0}} on occasion. The average annual temperature is around {{convert|13|C|F|1}}.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Pleven, Bulgaria\n|single line = Yes\n|metric first = Yes\n\n|Jan record high C = 22.8\n|Feb record high C = 24.0\n|Mar record high C = 31.2\n|Apr record high C = 35.1\n|May record high C = 37.5\n|Jun record high C = 38.4\n|Jul record high C = 44\n|Aug record high C = 41.8\n|Sep record high C = 40.8\n|Oct record high C = 38.3\n|Nov record high C = 28.8\n|Dec record high C = 23.4\n|year record high C = 44\n\n|Jan high C = 1.3\n|Feb high C = 4.6\n|Mar high C = 10.3\n|Apr high C = 18.1\n|May high C = 23.1\n|Jun high C = 26.7\n|Jul high C = 29.3\n|Aug high C = 29.4\n|Sep high C = 25.4\n|Oct high C = 18.2\n|Nov high C = 10.5\n|Dec high C = 4.1\n|year high C = 16.8\n\n|Jan mean C = -2.2\n|Feb mean C = 0.6\n|Mar mean C = 5.4\n|Apr mean C = 12.5\n|May mean C = 17.4\n|Jun mean C = 21.0\n|Jul mean C = 23.4\n|Aug mean C = 22.9\n|Sep mean C = 18.6\n|Oct mean C = 12.4\n|Nov mean C = 6.4\n|Dec mean C = 0.7\n|year mean C = 11.6\n\n|Jan low C = -5.5\n|Feb low C = -3.3\n|Mar low C = 0.9\n|Apr low C = 6.8\n|May low C = 11.5\n|Jun low C = 14.8\n|Jul low C = 16.7\n|Aug low C = 16.1\n|Sep low C = 12.3\n|Oct low C = 7.2\n|Nov low C = 2.9\n|Dec low C = -2.0\n|year low C = 6.5\n\n|Jan record low C = -29.3\n|Feb record low C = -22.2\n|Mar record low C = -18.9\n|Apr record low C = -5.7\n|May record low C = 0.6\n|Jun record low C = 3.4\n|Jul record low C = 8.7\n|Aug record low C = 8.9\n|Sep record low C = -0.6\n|Oct record low C = -6.5\n|Nov record low C = -20.4\n|Dec record low C = -24\n|year record low C = -29.3\n\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 39\n|Feb precipitation mm = 34\n|Mar precipitation mm = 33\n|Apr precipitation mm = 52\n|May precipitation mm = 68\n|Jun precipitation mm = 81\n|Jul precipitation mm = 63\n|Aug precipitation mm = 40\n|Sep precipitation mm = 38\n|Oct precipitation mm = 44\n|Nov precipitation mm = 45\n|Dec precipitation mm = 41\n|year precipitation mm = 578\n|source 1 = Stringmeteo<ref name=Stringmeteo>\n{{cite web\n|url =http://www.stringmeteo.com/synop/bg_climate.php#15528 |title =Stringmeteo&nbsp;\u2013 Pleven Climate\n|publisher=Stringmeteo\n|year=2011\n|accessdate=June 20, 2012\n}}</ref>\n|date=June 2012\n}}\n\n==History==\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2012}}\n\n===Prehistory and antiquity===\nThe earliest traces of human settlement in the area date from the [[5th millennium BC]], the [[Neolithic]].\n[[File:Pleven Antistene 4.jpg|left|thumb|The central streets of Pleven]]\n\nNumerous archaeological findings, among them the Nikolaevo treasure found in [[Bulgaria]], evidence for the rich culture of the [[Thracians]], who inhabited the area for thousands of years.\n\nIn the beginning of the new era, the region became part of the [[Roman province]] of [[Moesia]], and a road station called [[Storgosia]] arose near present-day Pleven on the road from [[Oescus]] (near modern [[Gigen]]) to [[Plovdiv|Philippopolis]] (now [[Plovdiv]]). It later evolved into a [[fortress]]. One of the most valued archaeological monuments in Bulgaria from the period is the [[Early Christian]] basilica from the fourth century discovered near the modern city.\n\n===Middle Ages===\n[[File:Pleven TodorBozhinov October 2009 (1).jpg|right|thumb|[[Pleven Regional Historical Museum]]]]\nDuring the [[Middle Ages]], Pleven was a well-developed stronghold of the [[First Bulgarian Empire|First]] and the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]]. When [[Slavs]] populated the region, they gave the settlement its contemporary name ''Pleven'', it was first mentioned in a charter by [[List of Hungarian rulers|Hungarian king]] [[Stephen V of Hungary|Stephen V]] in 1270 in connection to a military campaign in the Bulgarian lands.\n\n===Ottoman rule===\nDuring the [[History of Ottoman Bulgaria|Ottoman rule]], Pleven, known as ''Plevne'' in [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]], preserved its Bulgarian appearance and culture. Many churches, schools and bridges were built at the time of the [[Bulgarian National Revival]]. In 1825, the first secular school in the town was opened, followed by the first girls' school in Bulgaria in 1840, as well as the first boys' school a year later. Pleven was the place where the Bulgarian [[Folk hero|national hero]] [[Vasil Levski]] established the first revolutionary committee in 1869, part of [[Internal Revolutionary Organisation|his national revolutionary network]].\n\n===Siege of Plevna===\n{{main article|Siege of Plevna}}\nThe city (then mostly known as Plevna outside Bulgaria) was a [[Siege of Plevna|major battle scene]] during the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877-78|Russo-Turkish War]] of 1877\u20131878 that Russian [[Tsar]] [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] held for the purpose of the liberation of Bulgaria. The joint [[Russia]]n and [[Romania]]n army paid dearly for the victory, but it paved the path to the defeat of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in this war, the restoration of Bulgaria as a state and the independence of Romania from the Ottoman Empire. It cost the Russians and Romanians 5 months and 38,000 casualties to take the town after four assaults, in what was one of the decisive battles of the war. The siege is remembered as a landmark victory of the [[Romanian War of Independence]], as on 28 November 1877 the Plevna citadel capitulated, and Osman Pasha surrendered the city, the garrison and his sword to the Romanian Colonel [[Mihail Cerchez]].\n[[File:Pleven-Panorama-outside.JPG|thumb|right|[[Pleven Panorama]], one of the town's best known sights]]\n\nIn the [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition|''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'' Eleventh Edition]] of 1911 [[s:Author:John Henry Verinder Crowe|J.H.V.

The town experienced significant demographic and economic growth in the following years, gradually establishing itself as a cultural centre of the region.\n\nThe [[Bulgarian Agrarian National Union]], a leading [[interwar]] party representing the Bulgarian peasantry, was founded in the town in December 1899.\n\nPrior to the Bulgarian [[orthographic reform]] of 1945, the name of the town was spelled \u041f\u043b\u0463\u0432\u0435\u043d\u044a (with [[yat]]) in [[Cyrillic]].\n\n==Population==\n[[File:Pleven Town Hall Todor Bozhinov.jpg|thumb|right|The town hall of Pleven]]\nAccording to census 2011, Pleven has a population of 106,954 inhabitants as of February 2011.<ref name=\"cities census 2011\">{{in lang|bg}}[http://www.nsi.bg/census2011/pagebg2.php?p2=36&sp2=37&SSPP2=45 National Statistical Institute - Main Towns Census 2014] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110408064046/http://www.nsi.bg/census2011/pagebg2.php?p2=36&sp2=37&SSPP2=45 |date=8 April 2011 }}</ref> The ethnic breakdown is 97% [[Bulgarians]] among others.

The landmark Cape [[Kaliakra]] is located a few kilometers to the east, as is the tiny beachfront resort of [[Rusalka, Bulgaria|Rusalka]]. Three 18-hole [[golf courses]] with villa communities and marinas are being developed nearby, two of the courses are designed by [[Gary Player]] and one by [[Ian Woosnam]].\n\nDuring the 2000s, the town became famous with the annual [[Kaliakra Rock Fest]] featuring famous rock bands from around the world.\n\n==Etymology==\nWith the Bulgarian conquest in the 7th century AD, the name ''Karvuna'' replaced the similarly-sounding ancient Greek ''Krounoi'' as the then name of the neighboring modern town of [[Balchik]]; the names ''Karvunska Hora'' and ''Principality of Karvuna'' were related to that town, which was also mentioned on 14th-century Italian [[portolan charts]] with the Italianized form ''Carbona''.\n\nThe name ''Kavarna'' as referring to this city was first mentioned in the 15th century; perhaps it was a new name influenced phonetically by the preexisting names of Karvuna (which town was already known as Balchik) and Varna.\n\n==Geography==\nThe lay of the land is flat and the seacoast of Kavarna is {{convert|42|km|0|abbr=on}} long. Along it there are small beaches, including an artificial one. Gore Chirakman with its almost sheer slopes towers above the seacoast. Remains of stronghold walls, moats, buildings, churches and [[necropolis]]es can be found on the flat [[plateau]]. The region is rich in mineral waters.\n\nThe area around Kavarna offers opportunities for developing ecotourism and specialized tourism&nbsp;\u2014 examination and photography of plants, dolphins and various kinds of fish in the coastal waters.

During the 3rd and 2nd century BC, the town played an important mediating role between the local [[Thracians|Thracian]] settlements and the Greeks. Despite being unsuitable for wharfing because of its rugged cliffs, this part of the [[Bulgarian Black Sea Coast]] was an attractive centre due to the fact that the local people produced and traded with high quality grain.\n\nDuring the second part of the 1st century BC the ancient town fell in the sea because of a disastrous earthquake. The frontal part of the Chirakman broke off and together with the richest citizens fell into the [[Black Sea]]'s waters. According to the leader of the finished first part of the underwater archaeological expedition Kavarna 2005, Asen Salkin, the Roman town of Bizone has sunk two times in the sea. For that evidence the located form skin-divers borders of a sunk residential district of the town of Bizone in Kavarna's coast. For the presence of residential buildings the archaeologists judge by the found ashlars and parts of brick walls. The finds date from the 2nd century AD. According to the leader of the expedition this residential district has nothing in common with the disastrous earthquake from the 1st century BC. The underwater finds evidence for other phenomenon, for which the scientists express only suppositions, such as transgression and regression of the strata. It has started to transgress during the 1st century AD and this has continued to the 2nd century. It is possible that during this period the coast had risen by four metres and one day it suddenly fallen through.\n\nDuring [[Ancient Rome|Roman times]] the town was restored under the same name and quickly flourished, the settlement revived and the port brightened up.\n\n[[File:Kavarna HDR.jpg|thumb|300px|View of Kavarna]]\nIn the 7th century AD the [[Slavs]] and [[Asparuh]]'s [[Bulgars]] destroyed the [[Byzantine]] town and later founded a new settlement, which entered the [[First Bulgarian Empire]]. In the late Middle Ages the settlement grew and was subject to [[Tatar]] raids; in the 14th century it became part of the [[Principality of Karvuna]], which de facto broke away from the Second Bulgarian Empire under the rule of the [[Despot (court title)|despot]]s [[Balik (Bulgarian ruler)|Balik]] and [[Dobrotitsa]] of the Bulgarian royal Terter dynasty.<ref>\u0413. \u0411\u0430\u043a\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0432, ''\u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0431\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0435'', \u0422\u043e\u043c 1, 2003, \u0441. 457</ref><ref>\u041f\u0435\u0442\u044a\u0440 \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432, ''\u0421\u043a\u0432\u0438\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043a\u043d\u044f\u0437\u0435 \u041f\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0446\u0438-\u0420\u043e\u0436\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438&nbsp;\u2014 \u043a\u043b\u043e\u043d \u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u044f\u0442\u0430 \u0422\u0435\u0440\u0442\u0435\u0440'', online, retrieved 03-24-2007</ref>  In 1397, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] nearly destroyed the city, which was abandoned but resettled again and rebuilt by the early 17th century. Its present name was documented for the first time in the early 15th century.\n\nThe town was considered an economical and cultural centre during [[ancient history|Antiquity]] and the [[Middle Ages]] with rich and various remains&nbsp;\u2013 stronghold walls, early-[[Christianity|Christian]] [[basilica]], [[medieval]] [[church (building)|church]]es, and public buildings.\n\nNotable works of art, such as coins from different historical epochs, golden adornments, a golden Thracian treasure of applications, have been found in the area. Between the 15th and 19th century the town becomes popular under the name Kavarna, as a Christian settlement and port for grain export. From that time remain a Turkish bath, a medieval necropolis, a bridge, fountains, Christian churches and many inscriptions.\n\nDuring the [[Russo-Turkish War of 1877\u20131878]] Kavarna's Christian inhabitants, Bulgarians and [[Gagauz people|Gagauz]] alike, rebelled against the [[bashi-bazouk]]s and Circassian hordes. After the liberation the town became part of the [[Principality of Bulgaria]].\n\nFrom the beginning of 20th century Kavarna achieved a rapid progress as an economical and cultural centre. The town renamed ''Cavarna'' came under [[Romania]]n rule after the [[Second Balkan War]] in 1913 and again after the [[First World War]] in 1919.  This however, was met with resistance by the local Bulgarian population and its [[Internal Dobrujan Revolutionary Organisation]]. In 1940 the town was ceded back to Bulgaria by the [[Treaty of Craiova]].\n\n==Monuments and museums==\n\n===Dobruja and the Sea Display===\nThe Dobruja and the Sea Display is a small maritime museum. It is situated in an approximately restored [[Turkey|Turkish]] bath, the Hamam. It was built in the beginning of the 15th century and represents a massive beehive bath from stone, situated in the beginning of the valley leading to the port, and half a kilometre apart from the town centre. Many stone anchors, amphorae and ceramics found during the underwater archaeological expeditions are exposed there. Coins from different epochs and a golden Thracian treasure can be seen in the Treasure House Hall  The ancient and mediaeval colour painting expend our concepts for the ancient navigation around Dobruja's coasts.\n\n===Town Museum===\nThe Town Museum can be found in the building of the local library. Materials, revealing the thousand-year old history of the town are displayed in its exposition. Evidence for the life of the people in the region since ancient times are represented here. A model of prehistoric cave-dwellings, many tools, guns, rifles and pistols from the War of Liberation, as well as ethnographic materials&nbsp;\u2014 clothing, finery, folk-style cloth, are also exhibited\n\n===Ethnographic Museum===\n[[File:Dormition of the Theotokos Church - Kavarna.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Dormition of the Theotokos Church.]]\n\nThe Ethnographic Museum represents an old house from the end of the 19th century that belonged to a rich family. Its interior reveals the customs and culture of the people inhabiting that part of the country; premises typical for Dobruja houses, tools from the culture and the daily round of the people. The building is surrounded by a garden full of mulberry trees, peonies and tulips.\n\n===Churches===\nThere are two churches in the town both located in the town centre. The Church of [[Saint George]] was built in 1836 and the Dormition of the Theotokos Church in 1860. Both churches played an important role during the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule and after the Liberation as educational and cultural centers.\n\n===The old fountains===\nThese were 12 spring fountains situated along the valley to the port. Some of them were destroyed and the rest were restored recently. The great amount of spring water forms a small river.\n\n==Culture==\nSince 2004 the town has turned in one of the centres of musical life in Bulgaria. Kavarna has been the host to several [[Rock (music)|rock and roll]] concerts. In 2005 the most popular band to play in the town's stadium was [[Deep Purple]]. The other notable performers were mostly legends of German rock and [[heavy metal music]], such as [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]], [[Axel Rudi Pell]], [[Gamma Ray (band)|Gamma Ray]], [[Masterplan (band)|Masterplan]] and [[Destruction (band)|Destruction]]. On 27 August 2005 [[Accept (band)|Accept]], another German band, played here its last show with original lead vocalist [[Udo Dirkschneider]]. There is also a mural of [[Whitesnake]] singer [[David Coverdale]].\n\n2006 saw the start of the [[Kaliakra Rock Fest]] - A Metal festival (renamed to [[Kaliakra Rock Fest|Kavarna Rock Fest]] in 2010) including many metal bands. The same year followed the tradition with concerts of more metal bands as well as some pop and dance musicians. For example, Russian pop star [[Filipp Kirkorov]] sang there in September.\n\nIn 2007, performers included [[Heaven and Hell (band)|Heaven and Hell]], [[John Lawton (musician)|John Lawton]] Band, [[Manowar]], [[Mot\u00f6rhead]], [[Robert Plant]], and [[Ronnie James Dio]]. The next year saw the return of Manowar within [[Kaliakra Rock Fest]] with a 5-hour attempt to set a world record for the longest heavy metal concert. The next two days [[Alice Cooper]], [[Slayer]] and [[In Flames]] held concerts. In July 2009, [[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]] headlined the rock-fest, with Scorpions, [[Blind Guardian]] and [[Dream Theater]] also participating. [[Sonata Arctica]] also performed in 2008 and 2011.\n\nThe 2013 [[Volvo World Match Play Championship]] was held at the [[Thracian Cliffs Golf Course]].\n\n==International relations==\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Poland}}\n\n===Twin towns and sister cities===\nKavarna is [[Twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] with:\n\n*{{flagicon|RUS}} [[Podolsk]], Russia<ref name=\"Podolsk twinnings\">{{cite web|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?sourceid=navclient&hl=en&u=http%3a%2f%2fadmpodolsk.ru%2findex.php%3fcategoryid%3d126|title=Podolsk sister cities|publisher=Translate.google.com|date=|accessdate=2010-04-29}}</ref>\n\n===Honour===\n[[Kavarna Cove]] in [[Livingston Island]] in the [[South Shetland Islands]], [[Antarctica]] is named after Kavarna.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{center|<gallery>\nFile:Kavarna Bulgaria architecture.jpg|Architecture of Kavarna\nFile:Kavarna-church-mihalorel.JPG|Church in Kavarna\nFile:Dio monument.jpeg|[[Ronnie James Dio]] statue\nFile:David Coverdale Kavarna mural.png|[[David Coverdale]] mural\n</gallery>}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n* [http://www.kavarna.bg/ Official homepage]\n* [http://www.guide-bulgaria.com/NE/Dobrich/Kavarna Guide to Kavarna municipality]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070717223959/http://www.kavarnamap.eu/index_en.php Interactive map of Kavarna]\n\n{{Dobrich Province}}\n{{Bulgarian Black Sea resorts}}\n{{Kavarna}}\n{{Cities in Bulgaria}}\n\n[[Category:Towns in Bulgaria]]\n[[Category:Seaside resorts in Bulgaria]]\n[[Category:Populated places in Dobrich Province]]\n[[Category:Populated coastal places in Bulgaria]]\n[[Category:Greek colonies on the Black Sea coast]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=May 2013}}\n{{Infobox settlement <!--more fields are available for this Infobox--See Template:Infobox Settlement-->\n|official_name = Kavarna\n|subdivision_type = [[Countries of the world|Country]]\n|subdivision_name       = [[Bulgaria]]\n|subdivision_type1      = [[Provinces of Bulgaria|Province]]<br><small>(Oblast)</small>\n|timezone=[[Eastern European Time|EET]]\n|image_shield=BGR \u041a\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0430 COA.png\n|utc_offset=+2\n|timezone_DST=[[Eastern European Summer Time|EEST]]\n|utc_offset_DST=+3\n|image_skyline = Kavarna Bulgaria aerial photo from the Black Sea.jpg\n|map_caption = Location of Kavarna|\n|pushpin_map            =Bulgaria <!-- the name of a location map as per http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Location_map -->\n|pushpin_label_position = <!-- the position of the pushpin label: left, right, top, bottom, none -->\n|pushpin_map_caption    =Location of Kavarna\n|pushpin_mapsize        =\n|leader_title           =Mayor\n|postal_code_type       =[[List of postal codes in Bulgaria|Postal Code]]\n|\n|\nsubdivision_name1=[[Dobrich Province|Dobrich]]|\npopulation_total=11,397|population_urban=15834|population_footnotes=<ref name=\"statistika\"/><ref name=\"population\"/><ref name=\"pop-stat\"/>|\npopulation_as_of=31.12.2009|\nelevation_m=121|\npostal_code=9650|\narea_code=+359 570\n|coordinates            = {{coord|43|26|N|28|20|E|region:BG|display=inline,title}}\n|leader_name=[[Nina Stavreva]]|\n}}\n\n'''Kavarna''' ({{lang-bg|\u041a\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0430}}, is a [[Bulgarian Black Sea Coast|Black Sea coastal]] town and [[seaside resort]] in the [[Dobruja]] region of northeastern [[Bulgaria]].

The landmark Cape [[Kaliakra]] is located a few kilometers to the east, as is the tiny beachfront resort of [[Rusalka, Bulgaria|Rusalka]]. Three 18-hole [[golf courses]] with villa communities and marinas are being developed nearby, two of the courses are designed by [[Gary Player]] and one by [[Ian Woosnam]].\n\nDuring the 2000s, the town became famous with the annual [[Kaliakra Rock Fest]] featuring famous rock bands from around the world.\n\n==Etymology==\nWith the Bulgarian conquest in the 7th century AD, the name ''Karvuna'' replaced the similarly-sounding ancient Greek ''Krounoi'' as the then name of the neighboring modern town of [[Balchik]]; the names ''Karvunska Hora'' and ''Principality of Karvuna'' were related to that town, which was also mentioned on 14th-century Italian [[portolan charts]] with the Italianized form ''Carbona''.\n\nThe name ''Kavarna'' as referring to this city was first mentioned in the 15th century; perhaps it was a new name influenced phonetically by the preexisting names of Karvuna (which town was already known as Balchik) and Varna.\n\n==Geography==\nThe lay of the land is flat and the seacoast of Kavarna is {{convert|42|km|0|abbr=on}} long. Along it there are small beaches, including an artificial one. Gore Chirakman with its almost sheer slopes towers above the seacoast. Remains of stronghold walls, moats, buildings, churches and [[necropolis]]es can be found on the flat [[plateau]]. The region is rich in mineral waters.\n\nThe area around Kavarna offers opportunities for developing ecotourism and specialized tourism&nbsp;\u2014 examination and photography of plants, dolphins and various kinds of fish in the coastal waters. The variety of birds attracts tourists from all parts of the world and contributes to Kaliakra and Yaylata becoming one of the most preferred places in Bulgaria for the development of ornithological tourism.\n\n==Population==\n\n<!--THIS TABLE IS STANDARD TO ALL BULGARIAN CITIES ARTICLES.

During the 3rd and 2nd century BC, the town played an important mediating role between the local [[Thracians|Thracian]] settlements and the Greeks. Despite being unsuitable for wharfing because of its rugged cliffs, this part of the [[Bulgarian Black Sea Coast]] was an attractive centre due to the fact that the local people produced and traded with high quality grain.\n\nDuring the second part of the 1st century BC the ancient town fell in the sea because of a disastrous earthquake. The frontal part of the Chirakman broke off and together with the richest citizens fell into the [[Black Sea]]'s waters. According to the leader of the finished first part of the underwater archaeological expedition Kavarna 2005, Asen Salkin, the Roman town of Bizone has sunk two times in the sea. For that evidence the located form skin-divers borders of a sunk residential district of the town of Bizone in Kavarna's coast. For the presence of residential buildings the archaeologists judge by the found ashlars and parts of brick walls. The finds date from the 2nd century AD. According to the leader of the expedition this residential district has nothing in common with the disastrous earthquake from the 1st century BC. The underwater finds evidence for other phenomenon, for which the scientists express only suppositions, such as transgression and regression of the strata. It has started to transgress during the 1st century AD and this has continued to the 2nd century. It is possible that during this period the coast had risen by four metres and one day it suddenly fallen through.\n\nDuring [[Ancient Rome|Roman times]] the town was restored under the same name and quickly flourished, the settlement revived and the port brightened up.\n\n[[File:Kavarna HDR.jpg|thumb|300px|View of Kavarna]]\nIn the 7th century AD the [[Slavs]] and [[Asparuh]]'s [[Bulgars]] destroyed the [[Byzantine]] town and later founded a new settlement, which entered the [[First Bulgarian Empire]]. In the late Middle Ages the settlement grew and was subject to [[Tatar]] raids; in the 14th century it became part of the [[Principality of Karvuna]], which de facto broke away from the Second Bulgarian Empire under the rule of the [[Despot (court title)|despot]]s [[Balik (Bulgarian ruler)|Balik]] and [[Dobrotitsa]] of the Bulgarian royal Terter dynasty.<ref>\u0413. \u0411\u0430\u043a\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0432, ''\u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0431\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0435'', \u0422\u043e\u043c 1, 2003, \u0441. 457</ref><ref>\u041f\u0435\u0442\u044a\u0440 \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432, ''\u0421\u043a\u0432\u0438\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043a\u043d\u044f\u0437\u0435 \u041f\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0446\u0438-\u0420\u043e\u0436\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438&nbsp;\u2014 \u043a\u043b\u043e\u043d \u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u044f\u0442\u0430 \u0422\u0435\u0440\u0442\u0435\u0440'', online, retrieved 03-24-2007</ref>  In 1397, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] nearly destroyed the city, which was abandoned but resettled again and rebuilt by the early 17th century. Its present name was documented for the first time in the early 15th century.\n\nThe town was considered an economical and cultural centre during [[ancient history|Antiquity]] and the [[Middle Ages]] with rich and various remains&nbsp;\u2013 stronghold walls, early-[[Christianity|Christian]] [[basilica]], [[medieval]] [[church (building)|church]]es, and public buildings.\n\nNotable works of art, such as coins from different historical epochs, golden adornments, a golden Thracian treasure of applications, have been found in the area. Between the 15th and 19th century the town becomes popular under the name Kavarna, as a Christian settlement and port for grain export. From that time remain a Turkish bath, a medieval necropolis, a bridge, fountains, Christian churches and many inscriptions.\n\nDuring the [[Russo-Turkish War of 1877\u20131878]] Kavarna's Christian inhabitants, Bulgarians and [[Gagauz people|Gagauz]] alike, rebelled against the [[bashi-bazouk]]s and Circassian hordes. After the liberation the town became part of the [[Principality of Bulgaria]].\n\nFrom the beginning of 20th century Kavarna achieved a rapid progress as an economical and cultural centre. The town renamed ''Cavarna'' came under [[Romania]]n rule after the [[Second Balkan War]] in 1913 and again after the [[First World War]] in 1919.  This however, was met with resistance by the local Bulgarian population and its [[Internal Dobrujan Revolutionary Organisation]]. In 1940 the town was ceded back to Bulgaria by the [[Treaty of Craiova]].\n\n==Monuments and museums==\n\n===Dobruja and the Sea Display===\nThe Dobruja and the Sea Display is a small maritime museum.

{"title_page": "Rodulf (petty king)", "text_new": "{{other uses|Rodulf (disambiguation)}}\n'''King Rodulf''' is described by both [[Procopius]] and [[Paul the Deacon]] as the king of the [[Heruli]] kingdom on the [[Middle Danube]], who died when they were defeated by the [[Lombards]], some time between 494 and 508. After this defeat, in 512, Procopius reported that some of the Heruli nobility migrated north to [[Thule]] (what he called [[Scandinavia]]), settling near the ''Dani'' ([[Danes]]).\n\nIt is uncertain whether this Rodulf is the same king described in the ''[[Getica]]'' of [[Jordanes]] as the king of the [[Ranii]] on the island of [[Scandza]] (what he called Scandinavia), who left his kingdom near the Danes, and came to Italy, where he was embraced by the [[Ostrogoths|Ostrogothic]] [[King of Italy]], [[Theodoric the Great]]. Notably, Jordanes also mentions that the Heruli had been living in this area also, until they were driven out by the Danes, but he does not connect this Rodulf to these Heruli.\n\nThe Scandza passage of Jordanes is subject to many different interpretations, and some historians have proposed that Jordanes made errors. For example, [[Theodor Mommsen]] believed Jordanes should have described the Scandinavian Rudolf as a Herul, and the historian [[Herwig Wolfram]] has described this Scandinavian Rudolf as a [[Gaut]].<ref name=\"Wolfram2004p19\">Wolfram (2004) p. 49</ref>\n\nDue to the similarity of the circumstances, it has been suggested that the various accounts describe one individual, although this remains uncertain. Apart from the name Rudolf, the association with the region of the Dani, their apparent allegiance to Theoderic is notable. In a passage mentioning the Heruli, Jordanes mentioned that Theoderic adopted their king (who is not named in that passage) as a \"son in arms\". It is thus possible that Theoderic helped established him as king of the Heruli.\n\nMore speculatively, another debated issue is whether Rodulf could be the background for certain aspects of later heroic poetry, possibly including the [[Norsemen|Norse]] [[saga]] character [[Hr\u00f3lfr Kraki]].\n\n==King in Scandza==\n[[File:Jordanes, Norway tribes.png|thumb|340px|Locations of the tribes described by Jordanes in Norway, contemporary with, and some possibly ruled by Rodulf.]]\nKing Rodulf (''Roduulf rex'')<ref name=\"Maenchen\"/> of the Ranii tribe appears in the ''[[Getica]]'' (''De origine actibusque Getarum''; \"The Origin and Deeds of the Goths\") of the Roman historian [[Jordanes]]. Building on the now lost ''Historia Gothorum'' (\"History of the Goths\") of [[Cassiodorus]], Jordanes wrote his account at the request of [[Theodoric the Great]], King of the [[Ostrogoths]] and [[King of Italy|ruler of Italy]].<ref>Helle (2003) p. 82</ref> In the ''Getica'', it is said that Rodulf spurned his own kingdom,<ref name=\"Maenchen\">Maenchen-Helfen (1973) p. 487</ref> namely that of the \"Ranii\" tribe from Ragnaricii - Ranrike/Ranerike in today's Western Sweden. He therefore fled, likely together with a band of warriors,<ref>Skre (2008) p. 288</ref> to seek the sanctuary and support of Theodoric in [[Ravenna]] around 500.<ref name=\"Wolfram2004p19\"/>\n\nIt is unclear whether he was king of the Ranii tribe alone, or if he ruled all, or any other<ref name=\"Skre257\">Skre (2008) p. 257</ref> of the tribes described in the same context (as being the neighbours to the [[Heruli]], who were driven from their homes), namely the \"Granii, Augandzi, Eunixi, Taetel, Rugii, Aprochi.\"<ref name=\"Maenchen\"/> This list has been transliterated to mean the \"Grannii, A[u]gandzi, Eunixi <e>t Aetelrugi, Arothi,\"<ref>Nordgren (2004) p. 387</ref> and the tribes described identified as the inhabitants of [[Grenland]] (Grannii), [[Agder]] (A[u]gand''zi''), the \"island inhabitants\"<ref name=\"Nordgren\">Nordgren (2004) p. 464</ref> possibly of [[Karm\u00f8y]]<ref name=\"Thurston\">Thurston (1996) p. 111</ref> (Eunixi), the \"head [[Rugii]]\" of [[Rogaland]] (Aetelrugi) and [[Charudes|the inhabitants]] of [[Hordaland]] (Arothi).<ref name=\"Nordgren\"/> The vast geographic distances between the tribes, scattered throughout the Norwegian coast,<ref name=\"Skre257\"/> and the unlikeliness of a unified kingdom of such a magnitude at this early point<ref>Koht (1955) p. 12</ref> has been cited as arguments against such a possibility.\n\nSince the tribes are listed only in the context of being neighbours to the Heruli in the latter's former homeland, historian [[Otto J. Maenchen-Helfen]] thought it to be a linguistic error to interpret Rodulf as king of the tribes mentioned, instead holding that Rodulf should actually be read as king of the Heruli, as part of the greater context.<ref name=\"Maenchen\"/> Assuming that Rodulf had ruled all the tribes mentioned, historian Axel Kristinsson has speculated that it could have been natural for Rodulf to seek out some of his kinsmen, namely the southern Rugians who had joined the Ostrogoths as the Rogii sub-tribe after their kingdom was destroyed in 487.<ref>Kristinsson (2010) p. 225</ref> Historian A. H. Merrills, on the other hand, has proposed the possibility that placing Rodulf's origin with the Scandinavian tribes could have been politically motivated. Since Theodoric sought to expand his connections in the north at the time, his support of a northern exile would have given him significant benefits.<ref>Merrills (2005) p. 129</ref>\n\nSome modern historians have speculated that it could have been Rodulf, or potentially some of his subjects, who provided Cassiodorus or Jordanes with the information for their extensive lists and details of [[Scandinavia]]n peoples and tribes.<ref>Christensen (2002) pp. 270\u2013271, Fouracre (2005) p. 501, Skre (1998) p. 256, Goffart (2009) p. 64 and Merrills (2005) pp. 128\u2013129</ref> In any case, Rodulf was not the only Nordic warlord who visited the Goths and potentially could have provided knowledge about Scandinavian tribes.<ref>Skre (1998) pp. 256\u2013257</ref>\n\n==King of the Heruls==\nThe Byzantine scholar [[Procopius]] relates that the Heruli tribe had a king<ref name=\"ReallexikonKrag\"/> or leader (''h\u00e9gemon'')<ref>Weibull (1987) p. 8</ref> called Rodulf (''Rhodoulphos'') during the reign of the Byzantine emperor [[Anastasius I (emperor)|Anastasius]].<ref name=\"ReallexikonKrag\">Krag (2003) p. 58</ref> In the ''[[History of the Lombards|Historia Langobardorum]]'' (\"History of the Lombards\"), [[Paul the Deacon]] mentions that Rodulf was among the dead in a battle against the [[Lombards]]<ref name=\"ReallexikonKrag\"/> under [[Tato]], probably in 508.<ref name=\"ReallexikonWolfram\"/><ref name=\"Wolfram\"/> According to Procopius, Rodulf was enticed by his people to declare war against the Lombards, despite the latter's attempt of maintaining peace.<ref>Goffart (2009) pp. 207\u2013208</ref> A later version by Paul the Deacon gives Rodulf a legitimate ''[[casus belli]]'',<ref>Goffart (2009) p. 208</ref> as Rodulf purportedly declared war against the Lombards because his brother was murdered by Tato's daughter Rumetruda, after a fall-out between the two during his brother's return home after he had concluded peace with the Lombards.<ref name=\"Paul1XX\">Paul the Deacon, [http://www.northvegr.org/histories%20and%20chronicles/history%20of%20the%20lombards/005.html 1.

After becoming ruler of Italy, Theodoric travelled to what was described as the previous homeland of the [[Goths]], and thereafter, according to historian [[Herwig Wolfram]], wanted to establish an alliance with the Heruli king Rodulf. According to Wolfram, Rodulf \"probably included in his sphere of influence the region north of [[Lake Balaton]].\"<ref name=\"Wolfram\">Wolfram (1990) p. 318</ref>\n\n==Identifying Rodulf==\nThe German [[Classics|classicist]] [[Theodor Mommsen]] argued that the Rodulf of the Ranii tribe and the Rodulf of the Heruli tribe constituted the same person. He proposed that Rodulf could have arrived to Theodoric in 489, when he was in [[Moesia]].<ref name=\"Skre257\"/> Similarly, the scientist-explorer [[Fridtjof Nansen]] proposed that \"Heruli\" at first perhaps was a common name for bands of northern warriors, who to a certain degree consisted of Norwegians. In his book ''In northern mists'', Nansen suggested that Rodulf of the Ranii tribe could have migrated south with a band of warriors, and that on arriving at the [[Danube]], pressed by other warlike tribes in the vicinity, he sought alliance with Theodoric. Nansen believed this could have happened before Theodoric's invasion of [[Italy]] in 489, at the same time that the Heruli were just north of the Danube, and were the nearest neighbours of the Goths.<ref name=\"Nansen\">Nansen (1911) pp. 137\u2013139</ref>\n\nAlthough particularly German scholarship have identified the unnamed Heruli king and the Rodulfs as the same person,<ref name=\"Goffart3356\">Goffart (2009) pp. 335\u2013336</ref> including the ''[[Reallexikon der Germanischen Altertumskunde]]'' in an entry by Norwegian historian [[Claus Krag]],<ref name=\"ReallexikonKrag\"/> others such as historian [[Walter Goffart]] and archaeologist Dagfinn Skre have questioned at least parts of these identifications.<ref>Skre (1998) p. 257 and Goffart (2009) pp. 335\u2013336</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nIn the early 6th century, the Lombard king [[Wacho]] took [[Silinga of the Heruli|Silinga]] as his third wife, who was said to be the daughter of the last king of the Heruls.<ref>Waldman and Mason (2006) p. 389</ref> This has led some scholars to believe that Silinga probably was a daughter of Rodulf;<ref>{{Cite book|title=[[Reallexikon der Germanischen Altertumskunde]]|editor1=Beck, Heinrich |editor2=Geuenich, Dieter |editor3=Steuer, Heiko |publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=2006|language=German|volume=33|isbn=978-3-11-018388-7|page=6}}</ref> she again had the son [[Walthari]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr die Geschichte des Oberrheins|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=mjbnUMLPDoiN4ATvo4C4Cw&hl=no&id=pxtoAAAAMAAJ&dq=%22silinga%22+rodulf&q=%22sohnes+walthari%22#search_anchor|volume=149|publisher=G.

Some have furthermore argued that Rodulf could be the background for the character [[Hr\u00f3lfr Kraki]] who appears in the later [[saga]]s. Evidence for this includes the significant similarities between the traditions of, on the one side, the [[Scylding]]s of the ''[[Skj\u00f6ldunga saga]]'' and the [[Yngling|Scylfings]] of the Swedish sagas, and on the other, historical knowledge of the environment around the Heruli, Goths and [[Hun]]s.<ref>Krag (2003) pp. 58\u201359</ref>\n\nIt has also been speculated that the R\u00e1\u00f0ulfr mentioned in the [[R\u00f6k Runestone]] (which also mentions Theodoric the Great) could be identical with Rodulf.<ref name=\"Nansen\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Primary sources===\n* [[Cassiodorus]], ''The Letters of Cassiodorus'', [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/18590/18590-h/18590-h.htm#Page_236 IV. 2.], [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/18590/18590-h/18590-h.htm#Page_198 III. 3.]\n* [[Jordanes]], ''The Origin and Deeds of the Goths'', [http://www.romansonline.com/Src_Frame.asp?DocID=Gth_Goth_03 3. 24.]\n* [[Paul the Deacon]], ''History of the Lombards'', [http://www.northvegr.org/histories%20and%20chronicles/history%20of%20the%20lombards/005.html I.

Apart from the name Rudolf, the association with the region of the Dani, their apparent allegiance to Theoderic is notable. In a passage mentioning the Heruli, Jordanes mentioned that Theoderic adopted their king (who is not named in that passage) as a \"son in arms\". It is thus possible that Theoderic helped established him as king of the Heruli.\n\nMore speculatively, another debated issue is whether Rodulf could be the background for certain aspects of later heroic poetry, possibly including the [[Norsemen|Norse]] [[saga]] character [[Hr\u00f3lfr Kraki]].\n\n==King in Scandza==\n[[File:Jordanes, Norway tribes.png|thumb|340px|Locations of the tribes described by Jordanes in Norway, contemporary with, and some possibly ruled by Rodulf.]]\nKing Rodulf (''Roduulf rex'')<ref name=\"Maenchen\"/> of the Ranii tribe appears in the ''[[Getica]]'' (''De origine actibusque Getarum''; \"The Origin and Deeds of the Goths\") of the Roman historian [[Jordanes]]. Building on the now lost ''Historia Gothorum'' (\"History of the Goths\") of [[Cassiodorus]], Jordanes wrote his account at the request of [[Theodoric the Great]], King of the [[Ostrogoths]] and [[King of Italy|ruler of Italy]].<ref>Helle (2003) p. 82</ref> In the ''Getica'', it is said that Rodulf spurned his own kingdom,<ref name=\"Maenchen\">Maenchen-Helfen (1973) p. 487</ref> namely that of the \"Ranii\" tribe from Ragnaricii - Ranrike/Ranerike in today's Western Sweden. He therefore fled, likely together with a band of warriors,<ref>Skre (2008) p. 288</ref> to seek the sanctuary and support of Theodoric in [[Ravenna]] around 500.<ref name=\"Wolfram2004p19\"/>\n\nIt is unclear whether he was king of the Ranii tribe alone, or if he ruled all, or any other<ref name=\"Skre257\">Skre (2008) p. 257</ref> of the tribes described in the same context (as being the neighbours to the [[Heruli]], who were driven from their homes), namely the \"Granii, Augandzi, Eunixi, Taetel, Rugii, Aprochi.\"<ref name=\"Maenchen\"/> This list has been transliterated to mean the \"Grannii, A[u]gandzi, Eunixi <e>t Aetelrugi, Arothi,\"<ref>Nordgren (2004) p. 387</ref> and the tribes described identified as the inhabitants of [[Grenland]] (Grannii), [[Agder]] (A[u]gand''zi''), the \"island inhabitants\"<ref name=\"Nordgren\">Nordgren (2004) p. 464</ref> possibly of [[Karm\u00f8y]]<ref name=\"Thurston\">Thurston (1996) p. 111</ref> (Eunixi), the \"head [[Rugii]]\" of [[Rogaland]] (Aetelrugi) and [[Charudes|the inhabitants]] of [[Hordaland]] (Arothi).<ref name=\"Nordgren\"/> The vast geographic distances between the tribes, scattered throughout the Norwegian coast,<ref name=\"Skre257\"/> and the unlikeliness of a unified kingdom of such a magnitude at this early point<ref>Koht (1955) p. 12</ref> has been cited as arguments against such a possibility.\n\nSince the tribes are listed only in the context of being neighbours to the Heruli in the latter's former homeland, historian [[Otto J. Maenchen-Helfen]] thought it to be a linguistic error to interpret Rodulf as king of the tribes mentioned, instead holding that Rodulf should actually be read as king of the Heruli, as part of the greater context.<ref name=\"Maenchen\"/> Assuming that Rodulf had ruled all the tribes mentioned, historian Axel Kristinsson has speculated that it could have been natural for Rodulf to seek out some of his kinsmen, namely the southern Rugians who had joined the Ostrogoths as the Rogii sub-tribe after their kingdom was destroyed in 487.<ref>Kristinsson (2010) p. 225</ref> Historian A. H. Merrills, on the other hand, has proposed the possibility that placing Rodulf's origin with the Scandinavian tribes could have been politically motivated. Since Theodoric sought to expand his connections in the north at the time, his support of a northern exile would have given him significant benefits.<ref>Merrills (2005) p. 129</ref>\n\nSome modern historians have speculated that it could have been Rodulf, or potentially some of his subjects, who provided Cassiodorus or Jordanes with the information for their extensive lists and details of [[Scandinavia]]n peoples and tribes.<ref>Christensen (2002) pp. 270\u2013271, Fouracre (2005) p. 501, Skre (1998) p. 256, Goffart (2009) p. 64 and Merrills (2005) pp. 128\u2013129</ref> In any case, Rodulf was not the only Nordic warlord who visited the Goths and potentially could have provided knowledge about Scandinavian tribes.<ref>Skre (1998) pp. 256\u2013257</ref>\n\n==King of the Heruls==\nThe Byzantine scholar [[Procopius]] relates that the Heruli tribe had a king<ref name=\"ReallexikonKrag\"/> or leader (''h\u00e9gemon'')<ref>Weibull (1987) p. 8</ref> called Rodulf (''Rhodoulphos'') during the reign of the Byzantine emperor [[Anastasius I (emperor)|Anastasius]].<ref name=\"ReallexikonKrag\">Krag (2003) p. 58</ref> In the ''[[History of the Lombards|Historia Langobardorum]]'' (\"History of the Lombards\"), [[Paul the Deacon]] mentions that Rodulf was among the dead in a battle against the [[Lombards]]<ref name=\"ReallexikonKrag\"/> under [[Tato]], probably in 508.<ref name=\"ReallexikonWolfram\"/><ref name=\"Wolfram\"/> According to Procopius, Rodulf was enticed by his people to declare war against the Lombards, despite the latter's attempt of maintaining peace.<ref>Goffart (2009) pp. 207\u2013208</ref> A later version by Paul the Deacon gives Rodulf a legitimate ''[[casus belli]]'',<ref>Goffart (2009) p. 208</ref> as Rodulf purportedly declared war against the Lombards because his brother was murdered by Tato's daughter Rumetruda, after a fall-out between the two during his brother's return home after he had concluded peace with the Lombards.<ref name=\"Paul1XX\">Paul the Deacon, [http://www.northvegr.org/histories%20and%20chronicles/history%20of%20the%20lombards/005.html 1.

After becoming ruler of Italy, Theodoric travelled to what was described as the previous homeland of the [[Goths]], and thereafter, according to historian [[Herwig Wolfram]], wanted to establish an alliance with the Heruli king Rodulf. According to Wolfram, Rodulf \"probably included in his sphere of influence the region north of [[Lake Balaton]].\"<ref name=\"Wolfram\">Wolfram (1990) p. 318</ref>\n\n==Identifying Rodulf==\nThe German [[Classics|classicist]] [[Theodor Mommsen]] argued that the Rodulf of the Ranii tribe and the Rodulf of the Heruli tribe constituted the same person. He proposed that Rodulf could have arrived to Theodoric in 489, when he was in [[Moesia]].<ref name=\"Skre257\"/> Similarly, the scientist-explorer [[Fridtjof Nansen]] proposed that \"Heruli\" at first perhaps was a common name for bands of northern warriors, who to a certain degree consisted of Norwegians. In his book ''In northern mists'', Nansen suggested that Rodulf of the Ranii tribe could have migrated south with a band of warriors, and that on arriving at the [[Danube]], pressed by other warlike tribes in the vicinity, he sought alliance with Theodoric. Nansen believed this could have happened before Theodoric's invasion of [[Italy]] in 489, at the same time that the Heruli were just north of the Danube, and were the nearest neighbours of the Goths.<ref name=\"Nansen\">Nansen (1911) pp. 137\u2013139</ref>\n\nAlthough particularly German scholarship have identified the unnamed Heruli king and the Rodulfs as the same person,<ref name=\"Goffart3356\">Goffart (2009) pp. 335\u2013336</ref> including the ''[[Reallexikon der Germanischen Altertumskunde]]'' in an entry by Norwegian historian [[Claus Krag]],<ref name=\"ReallexikonKrag\"/> others such as historian [[Walter Goffart]] and archaeologist Dagfinn Skre have questioned at least parts of these identifications.<ref>Skre (1998) p. 257 and Goffart (2009) pp. 335\u2013336</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nIn the early 6th century, the Lombard king [[Wacho]] took [[Silinga of the Heruli|Silinga]] as his third wife, who was said to be the daughter of the last king of the Heruls.<ref>Waldman and Mason (2006) p. 389</ref> This has led some scholars to believe that Silinga probably was a daughter of Rodulf;<ref>{{Cite book|title=[[Reallexikon der Germanischen Altertumskunde]]|editor1=Beck, Heinrich |editor2=Geuenich, Dieter |editor3=Steuer, Heiko |publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=2006|language=German|volume=33|isbn=978-3-11-018388-7|page=6}}</ref> she again had the son [[Walthari]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr die Geschichte des Oberrheins|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=mjbnUMLPDoiN4ATvo4C4Cw&hl=no&id=pxtoAAAAMAAJ&dq=%22silinga%22+rodulf&q=%22sohnes+walthari%22#search_anchor|volume=149|publisher=G.

Some have furthermore argued that Rodulf could be the background for the character [[Hr\u00f3lfr Kraki]] who appears in the later [[saga]]s. Evidence for this includes the significant similarities between the traditions of, on the one side, the [[Scylding]]s of the ''[[Skj\u00f6ldunga saga]]'' and the [[Yngling|Scylfings]] of the Swedish sagas, and on the other, historical knowledge of the environment around the Heruli, Goths and [[Hun]]s.<ref>Krag (2003) pp. 58\u201359</ref>\n\nIt has also been speculated that the R\u00e1\u00f0ulfr mentioned in the [[R\u00f6k Runestone]] (which also mentions Theodoric the Great) could be identical with Rodulf.<ref name=\"Nansen\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Primary sources===\n* [[Cassiodorus]], ''The Letters of Cassiodorus'', [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/18590/18590-h/18590-h.htm#Page_236 IV. 2.], [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/18590/18590-h/18590-h.htm#Page_198 III. 3.]\n* [[Jordanes]], ''The Origin and Deeds of the Goths'', [http://www.romansonline.com/Src_Frame.asp?DocID=Gth_Goth_03 3. 24.]\n* [[Paul the Deacon]], ''History of the Lombards'', [http://www.northvegr.org/histories%20and%20chronicles/history%20of%20the%20lombards/005.html I.

Later, after he has slept off the effects to some extent, while at supper, the little girl shows him two tickets for the theater, begging him to take her. After some persuasion he consents to go. The play is a dramatization of [[\u00c9mile Zola|\u00c9mile Zola's]] ''[[L'Assommoir]]'', which shows how short a journey it is from peace and happiness to woe and despair by the road of rum. At the final curtain of the play, he is a changed man, going homeward with a firm determination that he will drink no more, which he promises his wife upon his return. Two years later we find the little family seated, happy and peaceful, at the fireside and we know that the promise has been kept.\n::''Moving Picture World'' (1909)\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Silent film A Drunkard's Reformation (1909).ogv|thumb|right|A Drunkard's Reformation]]\n* [[Arthur V.

Dehl proposed \"that they bring the Reverend [[Billy Sunday]] to Moline and have him preach the best sermon in the list, and they bring a great temperance lecturer here and instruct him to make his best effort\". Dehl said once they had left, he would put on two reels of film at his theater, and if the public does not vote one of them a greater temperance sermon than what the speaker had delivered, and the other a greater religious appeal than the sermon by Sunday, he would donate the money to a local hospital. The films he had referred for showing were ''The Drunkard's Reformation'' and ''The Resurrection''.<ref>{{cite magazine | url=https://archive.org/stream/moviwor10chal#page/n411/mode/2up | title=Pittsburg | magazine=Moving Picture World | date=1909 | pages=406}}</ref>\n\n''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that Biograph had received a letter from an exhibitor in an [[Iowa]] town, stating that when the film was shown there, it had caused the town to [[Dry county|\"go dry\"]] at the election which occurred the week after it had been featured.
