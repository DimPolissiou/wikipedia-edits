The former was [[Subduction|subducted]] beneath the latter, deeper into the earth. As the water-saturated sediments of the oceanic African plate were pushed to hotter depths inside the planet, the water boiled off and lowered the melting point of the [[upper mantle (Earth)|upper mantle]] enough to partially melt the rocks. Because magma is less dense than the solid rock around it, it was pushed upward. Finding a weak spot at the Earth's surface, it broke through, thus forming the volcano.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe volcano is one of several which form the [[Campanian volcanic arc]]. Others include [[Campi Flegrei]], a large [[caldera]] a few kilometers to the north west, [[Mount Epomeo]], {{convert|20|km}} to the west on the island of [[Ischia]], and several undersea volcanoes to the south. The arc forms the southern end of a larger chain of volcanoes produced by the [[subduction]] process described above, which extends northwest along the length of Italy as far as [[Monte Amiata]] in Southern [[Tuscany]]. Vesuvius is the only one to have erupted within recent history, although some of the others have erupted within the last few hundred years. Many are either extinct or have not erupted for tens of thousands of years.\n\n==Eruptions==\n{{Decade Volcanoes Map}}\n[[File:Procession des reliques de Saint Janvier en 1822.jpg|thumb|Procession of [[Januarius|Saint Januarius]] during an eruption of Vesuvius in 1822]]\nMount Vesuvius has erupted many times. The eruption in AD 79 was preceded by numerous others in prehistory, including at least three significantly larger ones, including the [[Avellino eruption]] around 1800 BC which engulfed several Bronze Age settlements. Since AD 79, the volcano has also erupted repeatedly, in 172, 203, 222, possibly in 303, 379, 472, 512, 536, 685, 787, around 860, around 900, 968, 991, 999, 1006, 1037, 1049, around 1073, 1139, 1150, and there may have been eruptions in 1270, 1347, and 1500.<ref name = \"global volcanism\"/>\nThe volcano erupted again in 1631, six times in the 18th century (including 1779 and 1794), eight times in the 19th century (notably in 1872), and in 1906, 1929 and 1944. There have been no eruptions since 1944, and none of the eruptions after AD 79 were as large or destructive as the Pompeian one.\n\nThe eruptions vary greatly in severity but are characterized by explosive outbursts of the kind dubbed [[Plinian Eruption|Plinian]] after [[Pliny the Younger]], a Roman writer who published a detailed description of the 79 AD eruption, including his uncle's death.<ref>Pliny the Younger, ''Letters'' [http://www.bartleby.com/9/4/1065.html 6.16].</ref> On occasion, eruptions from Vesuvius have been so large that the whole of southern Europe has been blanketed by ash; in 472 and 1631, Vesuvian ash fell on [[Constantinople]] ([[Istanbul]]), over {{convert|1200|km}} away. A few times since 1944, landslides in the crater have raised clouds of ash dust, raising false alarms of an eruption.\n\n===Before AD 79===\n[[File:Vesuvius (erupting), Brooklyn Museum Archives.jpg|thumbnail|Vesuvius erupting.

The black cloud represents the general distribution of ash, pumice and cinders. Modern coast lines are shown.]]\nReconstructions of the eruption and its effects vary considerably in the details but have the same overall features. The eruption lasted two days. The morning of the first day was perceived as normal by the only eyewitness to leave a surviving document, Pliny the Younger. In the middle of the day an explosion threw up a high-altitude column from which ash and pumice began to fall, blanketing the area. Rescues and escapes occurred during this time. At some time in the night or early the next day [[pyroclastic surge]]s in the close vicinity of the volcano began. Lights were seen on the peak interpreted as fires. People as far away as Misenum fled for their lives. The flows were rapid-moving, dense and very hot, knocking down wholly or partly all structures in their path, incinerating or suffocating all population remaining there and altering the landscape, including the coastline. These were accompanied by additional light tremors and a mild [[tsunami]] in the Bay of Naples. By late afternoon of the second day, the eruption was over, leaving only haze in the atmosphere through which the sun shone weakly.\n\nThe latest scientific studies of the ash produced by Vesuvius reveals a multi-phase eruption.<ref>{{harvnb|Sigurdsson|2002}}</ref> The initial major explosion produced a column of ash and pumice ranging between {{convert|15|and|30|km|ft}} high, which rained on Pompeii to the southeast but not on Herculaneum upwind. The chief energy supporting the column came from the escape of steam superheated by the magma, created from seawater seeping over time into the deep faults of the region, that came into interaction with magma and heat.\n\nSubsequently, the cloud collapsed as the gases expanded and lost their capability to support their solid contents, releasing it as a pyroclastic surge, which first reached Herculaneum but not Pompeii. Additional blasts reinstituted the column. The eruption alternated between Plinian and Pel\u00e9an six times. Surges 3 and 4 are believed by the authors to have buried Pompeii.<ref>{{harvnb|Sigurdsson|2002|pp=42\u201343}}</ref> Surges are identified in the deposits by dune and cross-bedding formations, which are not produced by fallout.\n\nAnother study used the magnetic characteristics of over 200 samples of roof-tile and plaster fragments collected around Pompeii to estimate equilibrium temperature of the pyroclastic flow.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|p=5}}</ref> The magnetic study revealed that on the first day of the eruption a fall of white pumice containing clastic fragments of up to {{convert|3|cm|in}} fell for several hours.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|p=3}}</ref> It heated the roof tiles up to {{convert|140|C}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|p=12}}</ref> This period would have been the last opportunity to escape.\n\nThe collapse of the Plinian columns on the second day caused pyroclastic density currents (PDCs) that devastated Herculaneum and Pompeii.

This cloud and a request by a messenger for an evacuation by sea prompted the elder Pliny to order rescue operations in which he sailed away to participate. His nephew attempted to resume a normal life, but that night a tremor awoke him and his mother, prompting them to abandon the house for the courtyard. Further tremors near dawn caused the population to abandon the village and caused disastrous [[tsunami|wave action]] in the [[Bay of Naples]].\n\nThe early light was obscured by a black cloud through which shone flashes, which Pliny likens to [[Lightning#Sheet lightning|sheet lightning]], but more extensive. The cloud obscured Point Misenum near at hand and the island of Capraia ([[Capri]]) across the bay. Fearing for their lives, the population began to call to each other and move back from the coast along the road. A rain of ash fell, causing Pliny to shake it off periodically to avoid being buried. Later that same day the pumice and ash stopped falling and the sun shone weakly through the cloud, encouraging Pliny and his mother to return to their home and wait for news of Pliny the Elder.\n\nPliny's uncle Pliny the Elder was in command of the [[Roman Navy|Roman fleet]] at Misenum, and had meanwhile decided to investigate the phenomenon at close hand in a light vessel. As the ship was preparing to leave the area, a messenger came from his friend Rectina (wife of Tascius<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faculty.cua.edu/pennington/pompeii/PlinyLetters.htm|title=Pliny Letter 6.16|access-date=May 11, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150511070405/http://faculty.cua.edu/pennington/pompeii/PlinyLetters.htm|archive-date=May 11, 2015|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>) living on the coast near the foot of the volcano explaining that her party could only get away by sea and asking for rescue. Pliny ordered the immediate launching of the fleet galleys to the evacuation of the coast. He continued in his light ship to the rescue of Rectina's party.\n\nHe set off across the bay but in the shallows on the other side encountered thick showers of hot cinders, lumps of pumice and pieces of rock. Advised by the helmsman to turn back, he stated \"Fortune favors the brave\" and ordered him to continue on to [[Stabiae]] (about 4.5 kilometers from Pompeii).\n\nPliny the Elder and his party saw flames coming from several parts of the crater. After staying overnight, the party was driven from the building by an accumulation of material, presumably tephra, which threatened to block all egress. They woke Pliny, who had been napping and emitting loud snoring. They elected to take to the fields with pillows tied to their heads to protect them from the raining debris. They approached the beach again but the wind prevented the ships from leaving. Pliny sat down on a sail that had been spread for him and could not rise even with assistance when his friends departed. Though Pliny the Elder died, his friends ultimately escaped by land.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://volcanology.geol.ucsb.edu/pliny.htm |authors=Richard V.

These are thought to have been killed mainly by roof collapses, with the smaller number of victims found outside of buildings probably being killed by falling roof slates or by larger rocks thrown out by the volcano. The remaining 62% of remains found at Pompeii were in the pyroclastic surge deposits,<ref name=\"Episodes\" /> and thus were probably killed by them \u2013 probably from a combination of suffocation through ash inhalation and blast and debris thrown around. In contrast to the victims found at Herculaneum, examination of cloth, frescoes and skeletons show that it is unlikely that high temperatures were a significant cause. Herculaneum, which was much closer to the crater, was saved from tephra falls by the wind direction, but was buried under {{convert |23|m}} of material deposited by pyroclastic surges. It is likely that most, or all, of the known victims in this town were killed by the surges.\n\nPeople caught on the former seashore by the first surge died of thermal shock.

Sub-Plinian eruptions producing about {{convert|0.1|km3}}, such as those of 472 and 1631, have been more frequent with a few hundred years between them. From the 1631 eruption until 1944, there was a comparatively small eruption every few years, emitting 0.001\u20130.01&nbsp;km\u00b3 of magma.

The effect is to increase the concentration of dissolved gases (mostly [[sulfur dioxide]] and [[carbon dioxide]]) in the remaining liquid magma, making the subsequent eruption more violent. As gas-rich magma approaches the surface during an [[eruption]], the huge drop in [[internal pressure]] caused by the reduction in weight of the overlying rock (which drops to zero at the surface) causes the gases to come out of solution, the volume of gas increasing explosively from nothing to perhaps many times that of the accompanying magma. Additionally, the removal of the higher melting point material will raise the concentration of [[felsic]] components such as [[silicate]]s potentially making the magma more [[viscous]], adding to the explosive nature of the eruption.\n\n[[File:Naplesbay01.jpg|thumb|left|The area around the volcano is now densely populated.]]\nThe government emergency plan for an eruption therefore assumes that the worst case will be an eruption of similar size and type to the 1631 [[Volcanic Explosivity Index|VEI]] 4<ref>{{cite web | url= http://vulcan.fis.uniroma3.it/vesuvio/VESUVIO_1631-1944.html | title= Activity of Vesuvio between 1631 and 1799 | work= Esplora i Vulcani Italiani | date= 1996\u20132009 | author= Giacomelli, L. | author2= Scandone, R. | publisher= Dipartimento di Fisica E.

The former was [[Subduction|subducted]] beneath the latter, deeper into the earth. As the water-saturated sediments of the oceanic African plate were pushed to hotter depths inside the planet, the water boiled off and lowered the melting point of the [[upper mantle (Earth)|upper mantle]] enough to partially melt the rocks. Because magma is less dense than the solid rock around it, it was pushed upward. Finding a weak spot at the Earth's surface, it broke through, thus forming the volcano.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe volcano is one of several which form the [[Campanian volcanic arc]]. Others include [[Campi Flegrei]], a large [[caldera]] a few kilometers to the north west, [[Mount Epomeo]], {{convert|20|km}} to the west on the island of [[Ischia]], and several undersea volcanoes to the south. The arc forms the southern end of a larger chain of volcanoes produced by the [[subduction]] process described above, which extends northwest along the length of Italy as far as [[Monte Amiata]] in Southern [[Tuscany]]. Vesuvius is the only one to have erupted within recent history, although some of the others have erupted within the last few hundred years. Many are either extinct or have not erupted for tens of thousands of years.\n\n==Eruptions==\n{{Decade Volcanoes Map}}\n[[File:Procession des reliques de Saint Janvier en 1822.jpg|thumb|Procession of [[Januarius|Saint Januarius]] during an eruption of Vesuvius in 1822]]\nMount Vesuvius has erupted many times.

There have been no eruptions since 1944, and none of the eruptions after AD 79 were as large or destructive as the Pompeian one.\n\nThe eruptions vary greatly in severity but are characterized by explosive outbursts of the kind dubbed [[Plinian Eruption|Plinian]] after [[Pliny the Younger]], a Roman writer who published a detailed description of the 79 AD eruption, including his uncle's death.<ref>Pliny the Younger, ''Letters'' [http://www.bartleby.com/9/4/1065.html 6.16].</ref> On occasion, eruptions from Vesuvius have been so large that the whole of southern Europe has been blanketed by ash; in 472 and 1631, Vesuvian ash fell on [[Constantinople]] ([[Istanbul]]), over {{convert|1200|km}} away.

The black cloud represents the general distribution of ash, pumice and cinders. Modern coast lines are shown.]]\nReconstructions of the eruption and its effects vary considerably in the details but have the same overall features. The eruption lasted two days. The morning of the first day was perceived as normal by the only eyewitness to leave a surviving document, Pliny the Younger. In the middle of the day an explosion threw up a high-altitude column from which ash and pumice began to fall, blanketing the area. Rescues and escapes occurred during this time. At some time in the night or early the next day [[pyroclastic surge]]s in the close vicinity of the volcano began. Lights were seen on the peak interpreted as fires. People as far away as Misenum fled for their lives. The flows were rapid-moving, dense and very hot, knocking down wholly or partly all structures in their path, incinerating or suffocating all population remaining there and altering the landscape, including the coastline. These were accompanied by additional light tremors and a mild [[tsunami]] in the Bay of Naples. By late afternoon of the second day, the eruption was over, leaving only haze in the atmosphere through which the sun shone weakly.\n\nThe latest scientific studies of the ash produced by Vesuvius reveals a multi-phase eruption.<ref>{{harvnb|Sigurdsson|2002}}</ref> The initial major explosion produced a column of ash and pumice ranging between {{convert|15|and|30|km|ft}} high, which rained on Pompeii to the southeast but not on Herculaneum upwind. The chief energy supporting the column came from the escape of steam superheated by the magma, created from seawater seeping over time into the deep faults of the region, that came into interaction with magma and heat.\n\nSubsequently, the cloud collapsed as the gases expanded and lost their capability to support their solid contents, releasing it as a pyroclastic surge, which first reached Herculaneum but not Pompeii. Additional blasts reinstituted the column. The eruption alternated between Plinian and Pel\u00e9an six times.

This cloud and a request by a messenger for an evacuation by sea prompted the elder Pliny to order rescue operations in which he sailed away to participate. His nephew attempted to resume a normal life, but that night a tremor awoke him and his mother, prompting them to abandon the house for the courtyard. Further tremors near dawn caused the population to abandon the village and caused disastrous [[tsunami|wave action]] in the [[Bay of Naples]].\n\nThe early light was obscured by a black cloud through which shone flashes, which Pliny likens to [[Lightning#Sheet lightning|sheet lightning]], but more extensive. The cloud obscured Point Misenum near at hand and the island of Capraia ([[Capri]]) across the bay. Fearing for their lives, the population began to call to each other and move back from the coast along the road. A rain of ash fell, causing Pliny to shake it off periodically to avoid being buried. Later that same day the pumice and ash stopped falling and the sun shone weakly through the cloud, encouraging Pliny and his mother to return to their home and wait for news of Pliny the Elder.\n\nPliny's uncle Pliny the Elder was in command of the [[Roman Navy|Roman fleet]] at Misenum, and had meanwhile decided to investigate the phenomenon at close hand in a light vessel. As the ship was preparing to leave the area, a messenger came from his friend Rectina (wife of Tascius<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faculty.cua.edu/pennington/pompeii/PlinyLetters.htm|title=Pliny Letter 6.16|access-date=May 11, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150511070405/http://faculty.cua.edu/pennington/pompeii/PlinyLetters.htm|archive-date=May 11, 2015|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>) living on the coast near the foot of the volcano explaining that her party could only get away by sea and asking for rescue. Pliny ordered the immediate launching of the fleet galleys to the evacuation of the coast. He continued in his light ship to the rescue of Rectina's party.\n\nHe set off across the bay but in the shallows on the other side encountered thick showers of hot cinders, lumps of pumice and pieces of rock. Advised by the helmsman to turn back, he stated \"Fortune favors the brave\" and ordered him to continue on to [[Stabiae]] (about 4.5 kilometers from Pompeii).\n\nPliny the Elder and his party saw flames coming from several parts of the crater. After staying overnight, the party was driven from the building by an accumulation of material, presumably tephra, which threatened to block all egress. They woke Pliny, who had been napping and emitting loud snoring. They elected to take to the fields with pillows tied to their heads to protect them from the raining debris. They approached the beach again but the wind prevented the ships from leaving. Pliny sat down on a sail that had been spread for him and could not rise even with assistance when his friends departed.

Herculaneum, which was much closer to the crater, was saved from tephra falls by the wind direction, but was buried under {{convert |23|m}} of material deposited by pyroclastic surges.

As gas-rich magma approaches the surface during an [[eruption]], the huge drop in [[internal pressure]] caused by the reduction in weight of the overlying rock (which drops to zero at the surface) causes the gases to come out of solution, the volume of gas increasing explosively from nothing to perhaps many times that of the accompanying magma. Additionally, the removal of the higher melting point material will raise the concentration of [[felsic]] components such as [[silicate]]s potentially making the magma more [[viscous]], adding to the explosive nature of the eruption.\n\n[[File:Naplesbay01.jpg|thumb|left|The area around the volcano is now densely populated.]]\nThe government emergency plan for an eruption therefore assumes that the worst case will be an eruption of similar size and type to the 1631 [[Volcanic Explosivity Index|VEI]] 4<ref>{{cite web | url= http://vulcan.fis.uniroma3.it/vesuvio/VESUVIO_1631-1944.html | title= Activity of Vesuvio between 1631 and 1799 | work= Esplora i Vulcani Italiani | date= 1996\u20132009 | author= Giacomelli, L. | author2= Scandone, R. | publisher= Dipartimento di Fisica E.

In 2011, by order of the [[State Great Khural]] and the government of Prime Minister [[S\u00fckhbaataryn Batbold]], the Police Academy and Border Troop College were unified under the Ministry of Justice and Internal Affairs as the University of Internal Affairs, before finally being renamed a year later to the Law Enforcement University of Mongolia.<ref name=\"google2\">{{cite book|title=Historical Dictionary of Mongolia|author=Sanders, A.J.K.|date=2017|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers|isbn=9781538102275|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UGwvDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA176|page=176|accessdate=2019-07-10}}</ref><ref name=\"leu\">{{cite web|url=http://english.leu.gov.mn/page/3494.shtml?sel=1637&subsel=7004|title=History of The Law Enforcement University &#124; \u0425\u0443\u0443\u043b\u044c \u0441\u0430\u0445\u0438\u0443\u043b\u0430\u0445\u044b\u043d \u0438\u0445 \u0441\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0443\u0443\u043b\u044c &#124; Law Enforcement University of Mongolia|website=english.leu.gov.mn|accessdate=2019-07-10}}</ref> In August 2018, a military high school ([[lyceum]]) was established as art of the university.<ref name=\"montsame\">{{cite web|url=https://montsame.mn/en/read/136304|website=montsame.mn|title=High school established at Law Enforcement University|accessdate=2019-07-10}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://english.leu.gov.mn/home.shtml Official Website]\n\n{{coord missing|Mongolia}}\n\n[[Category:Police academies]]\n[[Category:1934 establishments in Mongolia]]\n[[Category:Law enforcement in Mongolia]]\n[[Category:Universities in Mongolia]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_Enforcement_University_of_Mongolia"}
