The film was the third-highest-grossing of 1972, and led to him receiving an offer to star in a movie for [[Stanley Kubrick]], ''Barry Lyndon''. While that film was in pre-production, O'Neal played a jewel thief in ''[[The Thief Who Came to Dinner]]'' (1972) opposite [[Jacqueline Bisset]] and [[Warren Oates]]. Then he was reunited with Bogdanovich for ''[[Paper Moon (film)|Paper Moon]]'' (1973) in which he starred opposite his daughter [[Tatum O'Neal]]. Tatum won an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Oscar]] for her performance in the popular movie and in 1973, Ryan O'Neal was voted by exhibitors as the second-most-popular star in the country, behind [[Clint Eastwood]].<ref name=\"Cobbett60\">{{cite book|last1=Steinberg|first1=Cobbett|title=Film Facts|year=1980|publisher=Facts on File, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=0-87196-313-2|page=[https://archive.org/details/filmfacts00cobb_mc3/page/60 60]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/filmfacts00cobb_mc3/page/60}}</ref>\n\n===1974\u20131980: ''Barry Lyndon'', ''A Bridge Too Far'' and ''The Main Event''===\nO'Neal spent over a year making ''[[Barry Lyndon]]'' (1975) for Kubrick.
