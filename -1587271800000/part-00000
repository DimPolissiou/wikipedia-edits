It was founded in 1944 and serves under the authority of the [[French Football Federation]]. The current president of the league is [[Nathalie Boy de la Tour]]. It is heartquartered in [[Paris]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lfp.fr/contacts/|title=Ligue de Football Professionnel Contacts|access-date= 22 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe league is responsible for overseeing, organizing, and managing the top two leagues in France, [[Ligue 1]] and [[Ligue 2]], and is also responsible for the 44 professional football clubs that contest football in France (20 in Ligue 1, 20 in Ligue 2, and four in the [[Championnat National]]). The league also organizes a yearly cup competition, the [[Coupe de la Ligue]], that, unlike the [[Coupe de France]], is limited to professional clubs.\n\n==Foundation==\nThe history of the Ligue de Football Professionnel dates back before World War II when the committee's primary motive was to ensure clubs in France pay players their wages. The chairman of the early predecessor of the league was Emmanuel Gambardella. Another committee, which monitored professional clubs and the status of professional players also existed during this time and was headed by [[Gabriel Hanot]], who was later responsible for the creation of the [[European Cup]], now the [[UEFA Champions League]]. During the [[Vichy regime]], [[professionalism]] in France was abolished, which led to clubs forming unpopular regional amateur leagues. Under the current LFP hierarchy, the years 1939\u20131945 are non-existent.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the war, many clubs were hesitant to follow the initiatives of the French Football Federation due to their belief that the federation were not thinking in their best interests and, instead, opted to join an initiative by Gambardella referred the ''Groupement des clubs autoris\u00e9s''. On 27 October 1944, the Ligue Nationale de Football (National Football League) was officially founded with Gambardella being installed as the organization's first president. The league changed its name back to ''Groupement des clubs autoris\u00e9s'' shortly after and kept the name until 1970 before returning to Ligue Nationale de Football. In 2000, the league changed its name to the Ligue de Football Professionnel.\n\n==Mission==\nThe Ligue de Football Professionnel describes itself through its [[mission statement]]. The LFP must:\n\n* Organize, manage, and regulate all the aspects of professional football in France.\n* Finance all operations or any actions that are likely to develop the resources of professional football in France.\n* Apply the sanctions imposed by its authority organizations vis-\u00e0-vis members of sports clubs and its licenses and any other person bounded by these articles.\n* To defend the moral and material interests of [[French football]] in France.\n\n==Competition==\n\n===League===\nThe 44 member clubs of the LFP are grouped into two divisions: [[Ligue 1]] (20 clubs) and [[Ligue 2]] (20 clubs). The LFP also oversee the professional clubs that suffer relegation to third-tier [[Championnat National]]. Currently, there are four clubs playing in the third division that the league manages. In any given season a club plays each of the others in the same division twice, once at their home stadium and once at that of their opponents, though special circumstances may allow a club to host matches at other venues such as when [[Lille OSC|Lille]] hosted [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]] at the [[Stade de France]] in 2007 and 2008. This makes for a total of 38 games played each season in both leagues.\n\nClubs gain three points for a win, one for a draw, and none for a defeat. At the end of each season, the club with the most points in Ligue 1 is crowned champion of France. Teams are ranked by total points, then [[goal difference]], and then goals scored. If points are equal, the goal difference and then goals scored determine the winner. If still equal, teams are deemed to occupy the same position. If there is a tie for the championship, for relegation, or for qualification to other competitions, a play-off match at a neutral venue decides rank. The three lowest placed teams are relegated to [[Ligue 2]] and the top three teams from Ligue 2 are promoted in their place.\n\n===Cup===\nThe LFP also organizes a cup competition, the [[Coupe de la Ligue]]. Before its foundation as an official league cup in 1994, the competition was a summer friendly tournament. Unlike the [[Coupe de France]] which allows all clubs, regardless of status, to enter, the Coupe de la Ligue only allows professional clubs to participate. The competition is considered [[second-rate]] compared to the Coupe de France and attracts much criticism from many who deem the cup as having less prestige and creating fixture congestion.<ref>[http://www.francefootball.fr/FF/breves2010/20100326_202145_antonetti-defend-la-competition.html Antonetti d\u00e9fend la comp\u00e9tition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329112804/http://www.francefootball.fr/FF/breves2010/20100326_202145_antonetti-defend-la-competition.html |date=29 March 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==DNCG==\n{{main article|Direction Nationale du Contr\u00f4le de Gestion}}\nThe DNCG is the organisation responsible for monitoring the accounts of professional [[association football]] clubs in France.<ref name=\"rules\"/> It was founded in 1984 and is an administrative directorate of the LFP.

This diminutive of Jack is thought by some to have hailed from the earlier Jackin (from the name Jankin).<ref name=\"think\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thinkbabynames.com/meaning/1/Jack|title=Jack|publisher=Thinkbabynames.com|date=n.d.|accessdate=March 30, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.behindthename.com/name/jack|title=Behind the Name: Meaning, Origin and History of the Name Jack|first=Mike|last=Campbell|publisher=Mike Campbell|work=[[Behind the Name]]|date=n.d.|accessdate=March 30, 2012}}</ref> Alternatively, it may be derived from the name [[Jacques]], the French form of the name [[James (name)|James]] or [[Jacob (name)|Jacob]].<ref name=\"think\"/> There is also a theory that it is [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] in origin, meaning \"healthy, strong, full of vital energy\" (compare the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] word ''iach'', \"health\"), from a putative [[British language (Celtic)|Ancient British]] ''Yakkios''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sites.google.com/site/dexsowa/english-words-of-british-origin|title=English words of British origin \u2013 dexsow\u0101|publisher=[[Google Sites]]|work=|date=n.d.|accessdate=March 30, 2012}}{{unreliable source?|date=March 2012}}</ref> Whatever its origins, both the name and the word \"jack\" were long used as a term to refer to any man, especially of the common classes.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia\"/><ref name=dictionary>{{cite web|title=Dictionary entry, jack|publisher=[[Ask.com]]|work=[[Dictionary.com]]|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/jack|accessdate=March 30, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Frequency==\n\n===Given name===\nJack has become increasingly used as a formal, registered name, rather than a nickname, for boys in several English-speaking countries. It is now more popular in its own right than John, James and Jacob where it is originally derived from. In recent years, Jack has been the most common given name for baby boys in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Australia, and has grown in popularity in the United States. Jack was also the most popular baby boy's name in [[Scotland]] from 1999\u20132002, again in 2006, and from 2008 to the present; where it continues to be the most popular boy's name.

Since the late 20th century, Jack has become one of the most common names for boys in many English-speaking countries. While Jack is now a proper name in its own right, in English, it was traditionally used as a [[diminutive]] form of [[John (given name)|John]]. It can also be used as a diminutive for: [[Jacob]], [[Jason (given name)|Jason]], [[Jonathan (given name)|Jonathan]], Jan, [[Johann]], [[Johannes]], [[Joachim]] and sometimes for [[James (name)|James]], from its French form [[Jacques]], from the Latin [[Jacobus]]. It is also used as a female given name (often a shortened version of Jacqueline or Jackie)<ref name=\"JackFemaleUS\"/> and as a surname to a lesser extent.\n\nThe word jack is also commonly used in other contexts in English for many occupations, objects and actions, linked to the use of the word as a metaphor for a common man.\n\n==Origin==\nJack is thought to have originated in medieval times, derived from Jankin (c.f. [[Jenkin]]), a common [[diminutive]] of the name John.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n'Jackie' has also been used among men ([[Jackie Coogan]], [[Jackie Cooper]], and [[Jackie Gleason]] were all formally named John). This diminutive of Jack is thought by some to have hailed from the earlier Jackin (from the name Jankin).<ref name=\"think\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thinkbabynames.com/meaning/1/Jack|title=Jack|publisher=Thinkbabynames.com|date=n.d.|accessdate=March 30, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.behindthename.com/name/jack|title=Behind the Name: Meaning, Origin and History of the Name Jack|first=Mike|last=Campbell|publisher=Mike Campbell|work=[[Behind the Name]]|date=n.d.|accessdate=March 30, 2012}}</ref> Alternatively, it may be derived from the name [[Jacques]], the French form of the name [[James (name)|James]] or [[Jacob (name)|Jacob]].<ref name=\"think\"/> There is also a theory that it is [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] in origin, meaning \"healthy, strong, full of vital energy\" (compare the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] word ''iach'', \"health\"), from a putative [[British language (Celtic)|Ancient British]] ''Yakkios''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sites.google.com/site/dexsowa/english-words-of-british-origin|title=English words of British origin \u2013 dexsow\u0101|publisher=[[Google Sites]]|work=|date=n.d.|accessdate=March 30, 2012}}{{unreliable source?|date=March 2012}}</ref> Whatever its origins, both the name and the word \"jack\" were long used as a term to refer to any man, especially of the common classes.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia\"/><ref name=dictionary>{{cite web|title=Dictionary entry, jack|publisher=[[Ask.com]]|work=[[Dictionary.com]]|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/jack|accessdate=March 30, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Frequency==\n\n===Given name===\nJack has become increasingly used as a formal, registered name, rather than a nickname, for boys in several English-speaking countries. It is now more popular in its own right than John, James and Jacob where it is originally derived from. In recent years, Jack has been the most common given name for baby boys in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Australia, and has grown in popularity in the United States. Jack was also the most popular baby boy's name in [[Scotland]] from 1999\u20132002, again in 2006, and from 2008 to the present; where it continues to be the most popular boy's name. From 2003\u201305 and again in 2007, Jack was reduced to second place after Lewis took the #1 spot.\n\nAlthough the use of Jack as a formal given name is a recent phenomenon, John \u2013 from which Jack was often derived \u2013 was, along with William, the most frequent male name throughout the nineteenth century and in the first half of the twentieth century.<ref name=\"GalbiFreq2002\">{{cite journal\n  | first = Douglas A.  | last = Galbi  | url = http://www.galbithink.org/names.htm\n  | title = Long-Term Trends in Personal Given Name Frequencies in England and Wales\n  | version = 1.1  | publisher = (self-published)  | date = 2002-07-20  | accessdate = 2008-02-10\n}}</ref> Jack was included on lists of the most frequently used male baby names in the UK for 2003\u20132007.<ref name=\"UK2007Census_malenames\">{{cite web\n |url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/specials/babiesnames_boys.asp \n |title=Top 100 names for baby boys in England and Wales \n |accessdate=2008-02-09 \n |year=2007 \n |work=National Statistics Online \n |publisher=[[Office for National Statistics]] \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522193009/http://www.statistics.gov.uk/specials/babiesnames_boys.asp \n |archivedate=May 22, 2011 \n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.dfpni.gov.uk/index/news/most-popular-baby-names.htm\n |title       = Jack and Katie are the most popular baby names in Northern Ireland\n |accessdate  = 2008-02-10\n |date        = 2007-12-19\n |work        = News\n |publisher   = Department of Finance and Personnel, Northern Ireland\n |quote       = Jack has been the most popular boys name since 2003....\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://www.webcitation.org/66s0f9PRc?url=http://www.dfpni.gov.uk/404\n |archivedate = 2012-04-12\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release\n |title=Jack and Emma were the most popular first names in Northern Ireland in 2003 \n |publisher=[[Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency]] \n |date=2004-01-02 \n |accessdate=2008-02-14 \n |url=http://www.groni.gov.uk/Publication/512004111434.pdf \n |format=PDF \n |quote=Jack and Emma were the most popular first names given to children whose births were registered in Northern Ireland in 2003 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929210813/https://www.groni.gov.uk/Publication/512004111434.pdf \n |archivedate=2006-09-29 \n}}</ref> In 1994, Jack was the most popular name in [[London]] but was not among the 10 most popular in the preceding 970 years.<ref name=\"GalbiFreq2002\"/>{{Failed verification|date=August 2009}} A survey in December 2008 showed that Jack was the most popular name in the UK for the fourteenth consecutive year, since it overtook Thomas in 1994.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nIn 2014, Jack was again the most popular name for baby boys in Ireland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/life/family/mothers-babies/so-what-were-the-mostpopular-baby-names-in-ireland-last-year-30894974.html|title=So, what were the most-popular baby names in Ireland last year?|publisher=Kidspot|date=January 9, 2015|accessdate=2015-01-21}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2013, Jack was the [[List of most popular given names#Male names 5|most common name given to boys in Australia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://parenting.kidspot.com.au/australias-100-most-popular-baby-names/#.Us8-yqxBRPh|title=Australia's 100 most popular baby names|publisher=Kidspot|date=April 2, 2013|accessdate=2014-01-10|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110091657/http://parenting.kidspot.com.au/australias-100-most-popular-baby-names/#.Us8-yqxBRPh|archivedate=January 10, 2014}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census, 1990|United States Census of 1990]], \"Jack\" is an uncommon American name, the given name for 0.315% of the male population and 0.001% of the female population.<ref name=\"JackFemaleUS\">{{cite web\n |url=https://www.census.gov/genealogy/www/namesearch.html\n |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19970207210525/http://www.census.gov/genealogy/www/namesearch.html\n |url-status=dead\n |archive-date=1997-02-07\n |title=Name search results \n |accessdate=2008-02-09 \n |date=2007-09-07 \n |work=Search name files from 1990 Census \n |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] \n |quote=NAME(female):JACK ; RANK:3217; %FREQ (CUMM FREQ):0.001 (88.832) \n}}</ref><ref name=\"US1990POP\">The male, female, and total populations of the United States in the 1990 census were 121,239,418; 127,470,455; and 248,709,873, respectively.
