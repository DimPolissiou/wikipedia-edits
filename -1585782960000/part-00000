The aim was geopolitical rather than scientific, aiming to extend Italian hegemony in the area. The leader was an Italian archaeologist, [[Luigi Maria Ugolini]] who despite the political aims of his mission was a good archaeologist. Ugolini died in 1936, but the excavations continued until 1943 and the [[Second World War]]. They uncovered the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] part of the city including the \"Lion Gate\" and the \"Scaean Gate\" (named by Ugolini for the famous gate at [[Troy]] mentioned in the [[Homer]]ic ''[[Iliad]]'').\n\nAfter the [[communism|communist]] government of [[Enver Hoxha]] took Albania over in 1944, foreign archaeological missions were banned. Albanian archaeologists including [[Hasan Ceka]] continued the work. [[Nikita Khrushchev]] visited the ruins in 1959 and suggested that Hoxha should turn the area into a submarine base. The Albanian Institute of Archaeology began larger scale excavations in the 1970s. Since 1993 further major excavations have taken place led by the [[Butrint Foundation]] in collaboration with the Albanian Institute of Archaeology. Recent excavations in the western defences of the city have revealed evidence of the continued use of the walls, implying the continuation of life in the town. The walls themselves certainly seem to have burnt down in the 9th century, but were subsequently repaired.\n\nAfter the collapse of the communist regime in 1992, the new democratic government planned various major developments at the site. The same year remains of Butrint were included in the [[UNESCO]] list of [[World Heritage Sites]]. A major political and economic crisis in 1997 and lobbying stopped the airport plan and UNESCO placed it on the [[List of World Heritage in Danger]] because of [[looting]], lack of protection, management and conservation. Archaeological missions during 1994\u20139 uncovered further [[Roman villa]]s and an early Christian church.<ref name=\"HodgesBowden2004\" />\n\n== Directions ==\nThe site of Butrint is accessible from [[Sarand\u00eb]], along a road first built in 1959 for a visit by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]]. This road was upgraded during the summer of 2010. The construction was somewhat of an environmental disaster and may yet threaten Butrint's World Heritage Site status. The ancient city is becoming a popular tourist destination, attracting day-trippers from the nearby Greek holiday island of Corfu. Hydrofoils (30&nbsp;minutes) and ferries (90&nbsp;minutes) run daily between the New Port in [[Corfu (city)|Corfu]] Town and Saranda. Many visitors from Corfu use chartered coach services to visit Butrint from Sarand\u00eb, and additionally, a regular public bus service runs between Sarand\u00eb port and Butrint. Others arrive from the Qafe Bote border crossing with Greece near [[Konispol]] and cross the Vivari Channel by the cable ferry at Butrint.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nButrint Panorama.jpg |\nFile:Butrint-111183.jpg|\nFile:Butrint-111185.jpg|\nFile:Butrint-111187.jpg|\nFile:Butrint-111189.jpg|\nFile:Butrint-111190.jpg|\nFile:Butrint-111192.jpg|\nFile:Butrint-111194.jpg|\nFile:Butrint-111196.jpg|\nFile:Butrint-111198.jpg|\nFile:Butrint-111200.jpg|\nFile:Butrint-111202.jpg|\nFile:Butrint-111204.jpg|\nFile:Butrint-111206.jpg|\n</gallery>\n\n== Notable locals ==\n* [[Saint Therinus]], 3rd-century saint\n* [[Donatus of Euroea]], 4th-century saint\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Butrint National Park]]\n* [[List of Catholic dioceses in Albania]]\n* [[List of cities in ancient Epirus]]\n* [https://butrint.nd.edu/ Excavations of the Roman Forum at Butrint]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Sources and external links==\n{{commons|Butrint}}\n* [http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/former/t0363.htm GCatholic with incumbent bio links]\n{{Wikivoyage|Butrint}}\n{{EB1911 poster|Butrinto}}\n{{EB1911 poster|Buthrotum}}\n\n=== General information ===\n*[http://www.butrint.al Butrint National Park]\n*[http://www.butrintfoundation.co.uk The Butrint Foundation]\n*[http://www.butrinti2000.com Butrinti 2000 International Festival of Theater]\n*[http://www.shqiperia.com/foto/butrinti2.php Photo Albums]\n*[http://tripandtravelblog.com/a-good-reason-to-visit-albania-butrint/ Visiting Butrint]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20140903204835/https://www.dadajoe.com/b/butrint/ Butrint in Albania]\n\n=== History articles ===\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20040209055819/http://www.historychannel.com/classroom/unesco/butrint.html More information] on Butrint from [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]]\n*[http://www.albanian.com/information/history/roman.html Rome and Albanian history] from Albania.com\n*[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/6278418.stm Albania's Long-lost Roman City], [[BBC]]\n*[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_pictures/7980174.stm In Pictures: Sights of Butrint], BBC\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110721045040/http://www.socher.org/gallery2/v/albania/butrinti/ 176 photos from the archeological site of Butrint]\n*[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/research_projects/complete_projects/coins_from_butrint.aspx Coins from Butrint: Numismatic research on archaeological excavation - The British Museum]\n\n== Further reading ==\n*Ceka N., ''Butrint: A guide to the city and its monuments'' (Migjeni Books) Tirana 2005)\n*Crowson A., \"Butrint from the Air\", in ''Current World Archaeology'' 14 (2006).\n*Hansen, Inge Lyse and Richard Hodges, eds., ''Roman Butrint: An Assessment''.

He even used the chance to fight Michael openly, when Byzantine troops\nentered Butrint (1274), which Despot Nikephoros considered to be his own.\nNikephoros was able to retake Butrint from the Byzantines only in 1278, and pressed by\nCharles, he was forced to make a formal vassal submission to him, yielding to the latter the newly\nrecovered town as well as the port of Sopot.

The area was lightly settled afterwards, occasionally being seized by the Ottoman Turks, in 1655 and 1718, before being recaptured by the Venetians.

The aim was geopolitical rather than scientific, aiming to extend Italian hegemony in the area. The leader was an Italian archaeologist, [[Luigi Maria Ugolini]] who despite the political aims of his mission was a good archaeologist. Ugolini died in 1936, but the excavations continued until 1943 and the [[Second World War]]. They uncovered the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] part of the city including the \"Lion Gate\" and the \"Scaean Gate\" (named by Ugolini for the famous gate at [[Troy]] mentioned in the [[Homer]]ic ''[[Iliad]]'').\n\nAfter the [[communism|communist]] government of [[Enver Hoxha]] took Albania over in 1944, foreign archaeological missions were banned. Albanian archaeologists including [[Hasan Ceka]] continued the work. [[Nikita Khrushchev]] visited the ruins in 1959 and suggested that Hoxha should turn the area into a submarine base. The Albanian Institute of Archaeology began larger scale excavations in the 1970s. Since 1993 further major excavations have taken place led by the [[Butrint Foundation]] in collaboration with the Albanian Institute of Archaeology. Recent excavations in the western defences of the city have revealed evidence of the continued use of the walls, implying the continuation of life in the town. The walls themselves certainly seem to have burnt down in the 9th century, but were subsequently repaired.\n\nAfter the collapse of the communist regime in 1992, the new democratic government planned various major developments at the site. The same year remains of Butrint were included in the [[UNESCO]] list of [[World Heritage Sites]]. A major political and economic crisis in 1997 and lobbying stopped the airport plan and UNESCO placed it on the [[List of World Heritage in Danger]] because of [[looting]], lack of protection, management and conservation. Archaeological missions during 1994\u20139 uncovered further [[Roman villa]]s and an early Christian church.<ref name=\"HodgesBowden2004\" />\n\n== Directions ==\nThe site of Butrint is accessible from [[Sarand\u00eb]], along a road first built in 1959 for a visit by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]]. This road was upgraded during the summer of 2010. The construction was somewhat of an environmental disaster and may yet threaten Butrint's World Heritage Site status. The ancient city is becoming a popular tourist destination, attracting day-trippers from the nearby Greek holiday island of Corfu. Hydrofoils (30&nbsp;minutes) and ferries (90&nbsp;minutes) run daily between the New Port in [[Corfu (city)|Corfu]] Town and Saranda. Many visitors from Corfu use chartered coach services to visit Butrint from Sarand\u00eb, and additionally, a regular public bus service runs between Sarand\u00eb port and Butrint. Others arrive from the Qafe Bote border crossing with Greece near [[Konispol]] and cross the Vivari Channel by the cable ferry at Butrint.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nButrint Panorama.jpg |\nFile:Butrint-111183.jpg|\nFile:Butrint-111185.jpg|\nFile:Butrint-111187.jpg|\nFile:Butrint-111189.jpg|\nFile:Butrint-111190.jpg|\nFile:Butrint-111192.jpg|\nFile:Butrint-111194.jpg|\nFile:Butrint-111196.jpg|\nFile:Butrint-111198.jpg|\nFile:Butrint-111200.jpg|\nFile:Butrint-111202.jpg|\nFile:Butrint-111204.jpg|\nFile:Butrint-111206.jpg|\n</gallery>\n\n== Notable locals ==\n* [[Saint Therinus]], 3rd-century saint\n* [[Donatus of Euroea]], 4th-century saint\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Butrint National Park]]\n* [[List of Catholic dioceses in Albania]]\n* [[List of cities in ancient Epirus]]\n* [https://butrint.nd.edu/ Excavations of the Roman Forum at Butrint]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Sources and external links==\n{{commons|Butrint}}\n* [http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/former/t0363.htm GCatholic with incumbent bio links]\n{{Wikivoyage|Butrint}}\n{{EB1911 poster|Butrinto}}\n{{EB1911 poster|Buthrotum}}\n\n=== General information ===\n*[http://www.butrint.al Butrint National Park]\n*[http://www.butrintfoundation.co.uk The Butrint Foundation]\n*[http://www.butrinti2000.com Butrinti 2000 International Festival of Theater]\n*[http://www.shqiperia.com/foto/butrinti2.php Photo Albums]\n*[http://tripandtravelblog.com/a-good-reason-to-visit-albania-butrint/ Visiting Butrint]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20140903204835/https://www.dadajoe.com/b/butrint/ Butrint in Albania]\n\n=== History articles ===\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20040209055819/http://www.historychannel.com/classroom/unesco/butrint.html More information] on Butrint from [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]]\n*[http://www.albanian.com/information/history/roman.html Rome and Albanian history] from Albania.com\n*[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/6278418.stm Albania's Long-lost Roman City], [[BBC]]\n*[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_pictures/7980174.stm In Pictures: Sights of Butrint], BBC\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110721045040/http://www.socher.org/gallery2/v/albania/butrinti/ 176 photos from the archeological site of Butrint]\n*[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/research_projects/complete_projects/coins_from_butrint.aspx Coins from Butrint: Numismatic research on archaeological excavation - The British Museum]\n\n== Further reading ==\n*Ceka N., ''Butrint: A guide to the city and its monuments'' (Migjeni Books) Tirana 2005)\n*Crowson A., \"Butrint from the Air\", in ''Current World Archaeology'' 14 (2006).\n*Hansen, Inge Lyse and Richard Hodges, eds., ''Roman Butrint: An Assessment''.

At the 2006 census, its population was 161,674, in 40,771 families.<ref>{{IranCensus2006|18}}</ref>\n\nBushehr lies in a vast plain running along the coastal region on the [[Persian Gulf]] coast of south-western Iran. It is built near the ancient port city of Rishahr ([[Sassanian]], Riv Ardasher). It was the chief [[seaport]] of the country and is the administrative centre of its province.  Its location is about {{convert|1218|km}} south of [[Tehran]]. Bushehr has a [[Desert climate#Hot desert climates|desert climate]].\n\nBushehr was the main trade center of Iran in the past centuries. The city structures are traditional in style, modest in proportion and cost. Due to its lack of rail connection to the interior of the country and its shallow anchorage, it has lost its position as the primary port of Iran.\n\n==Etymology==\nDuring the [[Sassanian]] era, the name of the city was ''Ram Ardashir'' and later become ''Reyshahr'', eventually this turned in to ''Bushehr'', which is the current name of the city.<ref>Xavier de Planhol, \u201cB\u016a\u0160EHR i. THE CITY,\u201d Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica, IV/6, pp. 569-572 [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/bushehr-01-city]</ref>\n\n==History==\nTo the south of the present city, at Reeshire, are the remains of an earlier [[Elam]]ite (c 3000 BCE) settlement. During the Greek Macedonian Seleucid dynasty the city was refounded as '''Antiochia in Persis''' (\u0391\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03cc\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03c3\u03af\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2) by [[Seleucus I Nicator|Seleucus Nicator]]. A few decades later the city was rebuilt by Seleucus's son [[Antiochus I Soter|Antiochus]] who transferred there colonists from [[Magnesia on the Maeander|Magnesia]]. Also the Seleucid king [[Antiochus III the Great|Antiochus]] stayed there for a while in 205 B.C. after his campaign to the eastern provinces (212 -205 B.C.). Antiochia remained under Greek Seleucid rule until circa 170 B.C. It was one of the most important ports of the [[Sasanian navy]] and was named after the first king of this dynasty, [[Ardashir I]].\n\nIn the 5th century AD, Bushehr was the seat of the [[Nestorianism|Nestorian Christian]] expansion into southern Iran.\n\nIn 1737 the [[Dutch East India Company]] opened a trading post in Bushehr, which lasted until 1753.\n\n[[File:Bandar Bushehr by Eug\u00e8ne Flandin.jpg|thumb|''Bandar Bushehr'', drawing by [[Eug\u00e8ne Flandin]], 1840.]]\nIn 1763 the Arab governor of Bushehr [[Sheikh]] [[Nasr Al-Madhkur]] granted the [[British East India Company]] the right to build a base and trading post there.  It was used as a base by the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Royal Navy]] in the late 18th century. In the 19th century, Bushehr became an important commercial port.  It was occupied by British forces in 1856, during the [[Anglo-Persian War]] 1856\u20131857. Bushehr surrendered to the British on 9 December 1856.\n\nIt was occupied by the British again in 1915, this time due to the [[Germany|German]] [[Niedermayer\u2013Hentig Expedition]] including [[Wilhelm Wassmuss]].\n\nIndustries include [[fishing]] and a [[electric power|thermoelectric]] [[power plant]], while the inland area (also called Bushehr) produces [[metalwork]], [[rug making|rugs]] and other [[textiles]], [[cement]], and [[fertilizer]].  The Iranian [[navy]] maintains a base here.\n\n==Situation and significance==\nThe strategic location of the city of Bushehr has been the main reason for the establishment of the port of Bushehr. During the 1st and 2nd Millennium BCE, the Peninsula of Bushehr was a thriving and flourishing seat of civilization called \"Rey Shahr\". Many relics have been found in this regard related to the Elamite era and the civilization of Shoush (Susa). These structures of \"Rey Shahr\" are said to be related to Ardeshir of Sassanid dynasty and \"Rey Shahr\" was formerly known by the name of Ram Ardeshir. Thereby through the passage of time came to be called Rey Shahr and thence Bushehr.\n\nThe Persian Gulf and consequently the province of Bushehr enjoys a remarkable situation with trade in addition to its remarkable situation regarding military affairs. For these reasons the Europeans were interested to take control of the region and the city of Bushehr. The Portuguese, invaded the city of Bushehr in 1506 CE and attempted to take the place of the Egyptian and the Venetian traders who were dominant in the region.\n\nIn 1734 Nader Shah of [[Afsharid dynasty]] chose it as the site for an Iranian [[naval base]]. During the Zand era, the region was a place for political challenges between different countries and political groups. When the Qajar dynasty replaced the Zand dynasty, they had less control on the region of the Persian Gulf, so the British influence in the region increased gradually.\n\nAt the end of the 18th century, the British and Dutch transferred their regional commercial offices to Bushehr, and during the 19th century the town was prominent as the home of the British political agent for the Persian Gulf. The Consulate General of British governed Bushehr for 20 years. This situation had lasted till 1913, and during the long battle between the Iranian and the British troops, the Iranians lost in 1857 and the British influence expanded to include all the Persian Gulf coast. But in 1913 the Iranians won the long battle. Britain moved its diplomatic and commercial center across the Persian Gulf to Bahrein in 1946. The city was economically depressed until the 1960s when the government initiated a major development program. In 1975 the government began building a nuclear power plant at Bushehr. This facility was only partially completed when it was bombed by Iraq during the Iran-Iraq War (1980\u20131988). When Germany, the initial backer of the plant, declined to complete it after the war, Iran tried to secure aid from other countries. In 1995, however, Russia signed an agreement to finish the plant.\n\n[[File:ETH-BIB-Buschehr aus 300 m H\u00f6he-Persienflug 1924-1925-LBS MH02-02-0203-AL-FL.tif|thumb|Aerial view of Bushehr (1925) photographed by [[Walter Mittelholzer]], [[ETH-Bibliothek]].]]\nBushehr is one of the important ports in Persian Gulf which has an [[Bushehr Airport|international airport]], and highways connect the city to Ahvaz to the northwest and Shiraz to the northeast. A secondary coastal road links Bushehr to Bandar-e Abbas to the southeast. The old section of central Bushehr has many examples of traditional Persian Gulf architecture from the period 1870 to 1920.\n\nBushehr is an export market for the farm produce of the neighboring and fertile Fars Province. Bushehr's industries include seafood canneries, food-processing plants, and engineering firms. It has a population of 205,320 (2001 estimate).\n\n==Sports==\nBushehr's two major Football teams are [[Shahin Bushehr F.C.|Shahin]], which currently plays in the [[Persian Gulf Pro League]], and [[Iranjavan F.C.|Iranjavan]], which plays in the [[Azadegan League]].\n\nBushehr has a few Dragonboat teams. Their junior team Sokkan I.R. Iran participated in the 2014 Club Crew World Championships in Ravenna, Italy. They performed exceedingly well, placing third in both 200 meter and 500 meter in Junior A Open.\n\n== Geography ==\n\n=== Climate ===\nBushehr has a [[hot semi-arid climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: BSh) with a precipitation pattern resembling a [[mediterranean climate]], albeit it is both too hot and dry for too long to qualify as such, by a wide margin, due to the threshold for hot climates being much higher in terms of required rainfall.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Bushehr (1951\u20132010)\n|metric first = Y\n|single line = Y\n|Jan record high C = 30.0\n|Feb

development==\n{{main|Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant}}\n\nBushehr is twelve kilometres from the site of the [[Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant]] being built in cooperation with [[Russia]].  The work was begun by the [[Bonn]] firm {{ill|Kraftwerk Union|de}} A.G., a unit of [[Siemens AG]], which contracted to build two nuclear reactors based on a contract worth $4 to $6 billion, signed in 1975.\n\nWork stopped in January 1979, and Kraftwerk Union fully withdrew from the project in July 1979, with one reactor 50% complete, and the other reactor 85% complete. They said they based their action on Iran's non-payment of $450 million in overdue payments.  The company had received $2.5 billion of the total contract. Their cancellation came following the 1979 [[Iranian Revolution]]. Iran subsequently requested that Siemens finish construction, but Siemens declined.  Shortly afterwards [[Iraq]] invaded Iran and the nuclear programme was stopped until the end of the war. The reactors were damaged by multiple Iraqi air strikes between March 1984 and 1988.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/iran/bushehr-intro.htm|title=Bushehr - Iran Nuclear Reactor|first=John|last=Pike|website=www.globalsecurity.org}}</ref>\n\nIn 1995, Russia signed a contract to supply a [[light water reactor]] for the plant (the contract is believed to be valued between $700 [[million]] and $1.2 [[1,000,000,000 (number)|billion]] USD). The agreement calls for the spent [[fuel rod]]s to be sent back to Russia for reprocessing. The plant started adding electricity to the national grid on 3 September 2011,<ref name=guardian-20110904>{{cite news

At the 2006 census, its population was 161,674, in 40,771 families.<ref>{{IranCensus2006|18}}</ref>\n\nBushehr lies in a vast plain running along the coastal region on the [[Persian Gulf]] coast of south-western Iran. It is built near the ancient port city of Rishahr ([[Sassanian]], Riv Ardasher). It was the chief [[seaport]] of the country and is the administrative centre of its province.  Its location is about {{convert|1218|km}} south of [[Tehran]]. Bushehr has a [[Desert climate#Hot desert climates|desert climate]].\n\nBushehr was the main trade center of Iran in the past centuries. The city structures are traditional in style, modest in proportion and cost. Due to its lack of rail connection to the interior of the country and its shallow anchorage, it has lost its position as the primary port of Iran.\n\n==Etymology==\nDuring the [[Sassanian]] era, the name of the city was ''Ram Ardashir'' and later become ''Reyshahr'', eventually this turned in to ''Bushehr'', which is the current name of the city.<ref>Xavier de Planhol, \u201cB\u016a\u0160EHR i. THE CITY,\u201d Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica, IV/6, pp. 569-572 [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/bushehr-01-city]</ref>\n\n==History==\nTo the south of the present city, at Reeshire, are the remains of an earlier [[Elam]]ite (c 3000 BCE) settlement. During the Greek Macedonian Seleucid dynasty the city was refounded as '''Antiochia in Persis''' (\u0391\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03cc\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03c3\u03af\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2) by [[Seleucus I Nicator|Seleucus Nicator]]. A few decades later the city was rebuilt by Seleucus's son [[Antiochus I Soter|Antiochus]] who transferred there colonists from [[Magnesia on the Maeander|Magnesia]]. Also the Seleucid king [[Antiochus III the Great|Antiochus]] stayed there for a while in 205 B.C. after his campaign to the eastern provinces (212 -205 B.C.). Antiochia remained under Greek Seleucid rule until circa 170 B.C. It was one of the most important ports of the [[Sasanian navy]] and was named after the first king of this dynasty, [[Ardashir I]].\n\nIn the 5th century AD, Bushehr was the seat of the [[Nestorianism|Nestorian Christian]] expansion into southern Iran.\n\nIn 1737 the [[Dutch East India Company]] opened a trading post in Bushehr, which lasted until 1753.\n\n[[File:Bandar Bushehr by Eug\u00e8ne Flandin.jpg|thumb|''Bandar Bushehr'', drawing by [[Eug\u00e8ne Flandin]], 1840.]]\nIn 1763 the Arab governor of Bushehr [[Sheikh]] [[Nasr Al-Madhkur]] granted the [[British East India Company]] the right to build a base and trading post there.  It was used as a base by the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Royal Navy]] in the late 18th century. In the 19th century, Bushehr became an important commercial port.  It was occupied by British forces in 1856, during the [[Anglo-Persian War]] 1856-1857. Bushehr surrendered to the British on 9 December 1856.\n\nIt was occupied by the British again in 1915, this time due to the [[Germany|German]] [[Niedermayer\u2013Hentig Expedition]] including [[Wilhelm Wassmuss]].\n\nIndustries include [[fishing]] and a [[electric power|thermoelectric]] [[power plant]], while the inland area (also called Bushehr) produces [[metalwork]], [[rug making|rugs]] and other [[textiles]], [[cement]], and [[fertilizer]].  The Iranian [[navy]] maintains a base here.\n\n==Situation and significance==\nThe strategic location of the city of Bushehr has been the main reason for the establishment of the port of Bushehr. During the 1st and 2nd Millennium BCE, the Peninsula of Bushehr was a thriving and flourishing seat of civilization called \"Rey Shahr\". Many relics have been found in this regard related to the Elamite era and the civilization of Shoush (Susa). These structures of \"Rey Shahr\" are said to be related to Ardeshir of Sassanid dynasty and \"Rey Shahr\" was formerly known by the name of Ram Ardeshir. Thereby through the passage of time came to be called Rey Shahr and thence Bushehr.\n\nThe Persian Gulf and consequently the province of Bushehr enjoys a remarkable situation with trade in addition to its remarkable situation regarding military affairs. For these reasons the Europeans were interested to take control of the region and the city of Bushehr. The Portuguese, invaded the city of Bushehr in 1506 CE and attempted to take the place of the Egyptian and the Venetian traders who were dominant in the region.\n\nIn 1734 Nader Shah of [[Afsharid dynasty]] chose it as the site for an Iranian [[naval base]]. During the Zand era, the region was a place for political challenges between different countries and political groups. When the Qajar dynasty replaced the Zand dynasty, they had less control on the region of the Persian Gulf, so the British influence in the region increased gradually.\n\nAt the end of the 18th century, the British and Dutch transferred their regional commercial offices to Bushehr, and during the 19th century the town was prominent as the home of the British political agent for the Persian Gulf. The Consulate General of British governed Bushehr for 20 years. This situation had lasted till 1913, and during the long battle between the Iranian and the British troops, the Iranians lost in 1857 and the British influence expanded to include all the Persian Gulf coast. But in 1913 the Iranians won the long battle. Britain moved its diplomatic and commercial center across the Persian Gulf to Bahrein in 1946. The city was economically depressed until the 1960s when the government initiated a major development program. In 1975 the government began building a nuclear power plant at Bushehr. This facility was only partially completed when it was bombed by Iraq during the Iran-Iraq War (1980\u20131988). When Germany, the initial backer of the plant, declined to complete it after the war, Iran tried to secure aid from other countries. In 1995, however, Russia signed an agreement to finish the plant.\n\n[[File:ETH-BIB-Buschehr aus 300 m H\u00f6he-Persienflug 1924-1925-LBS MH02-02-0203-AL-FL.tif|thumb|Aerial view of Bushehr (1925) photographed by [[Walter Mittelholzer]], [[ETH-Bibliothek]].]]\nBushehr is one of the important ports in Persian Gulf which has an [[Bushehr Airport|international airport]], and highways connect the city to Ahvaz to the northwest and Shiraz to the northeast. A secondary coastal road links Bushehr to Bandar-e Abbas to the southeast. The old section of central Bushehr has many examples of traditional Persian Gulf architecture from the period 1870 to 1920.\n\nBushehr is an export market for the farm produce of the neighboring and fertile Fars Province. Bushehr's industries include seafood canneries, food-processing plants, and engineering firms. It has a population of 205,320 (2001 estimate).\n\n==Sports==\nBushehr's two major Football teams are [[Shahin Bushehr F.C.|Shahin]], which currently plays in the [[Persian Gulf Pro League]], and [[Iranjavan F.C.|Iranjavan]], which plays in the [[Azadegan League]].\n\nBushehr has a few Dragonboat teams. Their junior team Sokkan I.R. Iran participated in the 2014 Club Crew World Championships in Ravenna, Italy. They performed exceedingly well, placing third in both 200 meter and 500 meter in Junior A Open.\n\n== Geography ==\n\n=== Climate ===\nBushehr has a [[hot semi-arid climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: BSh) with a precipitation pattern resembling a [[mediterranean climate]], albeit it is both too hot and dry for too long to qualify as such, by a wide margin, due to the threshold for hot climates being much higher in terms of required rainfall.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Bushehr (1951\u20132010)\n|metric first = Y\n|single line = Y\n|Jan record high C = 30.0\n|Feb

development==\n{{main|Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant}}\n\nBushehr is twelve kilometres from the site of the [[Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant]] being built in cooperation with [[Russia]].  The work was begun by the [[Bonn]] firm {{ill|Kraftwerk Union|de}} A.G., a unit of [[Siemens AG]], which contracted to build two nuclear reactors based on a contract worth $4 to $6 billion, signed in 1975.\n\nWork stopped in January 1979, and Kraftwerk Union fully withdrew from the project in July 1979, with one reactor 50% complete, and the other reactor 85% complete. They said they based their action on Iran's non-payment of $450 million in overdue payments.  The company had received $2.5 billion of the total contract. Their cancellation came following the 1979 [[Iranian Revolution]]. Iran subsequently requested that Siemens finish construction, but Siemens declined.  Shortly afterwards [[Iraq]] invaded Iran and the nuclear programme was stopped until the end of the war.

They were led by [[shamanism|shamans]], who systematized tribal beliefs and cults. From the second half of the 17th century, beliefs and cults in the shamanic form were displaced by [[Buddhism]], which became widespread in ethnic Buryatia. By the end of the 19th century, the majority of Buryats were part of the Buddhist tradition. A synthesis of Buddhism and traditional beliefs that formed a system of ecological traditions has constituted a major attribute of Buryat culture.<ref>[http://www.unspecial.org/2013/01/buryatia-a-symbol-of-eurasia-in-the-heartland-of-baikal Esuna Dugarova.

Many Slavs, who constitute around 67% of the population, are Russian Orthodox. Since the breakup of the USSR in 1991, a small number have converted to various Protestant denominations or to Rodnovery, Slavic native faith. There are also some Catholics among the Slavs. Most of the Germans (0.11% of the population) are also Orthodox, so are some other non-European groups like Armenians (0.23%), Georgians (0.03%), and [[Soyot]] (0.37%).

{"title_page": "History of Burundi", "text_new": "{{More citations needed|date=July 2008}}\n{{History of Burundi|expanded=all}}\n{{Culture of Burundi}}\n'''[[Burundi]]''' is one of the few countries in [[Africa]], along with its closely linked neighbour [[Rwanda]] among others (such as [[Botswana]], [[Lesotho]], and [[Swaziland]]), to be a direct territorial continuation of a pre-colonial era African state.\n\n==Kingdom of Burundi (1680\u20131966)==\n{{Further|Kingdom of Burundi}}\n\nThe origins of Burundi are known from a mix of [[oral history]] and [[archaeology]].  There are two main founding legends for Burundi.  Both suggest that the nation was founded by a man named [[Cambarantama]]. The legend most promoted today states that he was Rwandan.  The other version, more common in pre-colonial Burundi says that Cambarantama came from the southern state of Buha.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\nThe first evidence of the Burundian state is from 16th century where it emerged on the eastern foothills.  Over the following centuries it expanded, annexing smaller neighbours and competing with Rwanda.  Its greatest growth occurred under [[Ntare IV Rutaganzwa Rugamba]], who ruled the country from about 1796 to 1850 and saw the kingdom double in size.\n\nThe Kingdom of Burundi was characterized by a hierarchical political authority and tributary economic exchange. The king, known as the ''[[mwami]]'' headed a princely [[aristocracy]] (''[[ganwa]]'') which owned most of the land and required a tribute, or tax, from local farmers and herders. In the mid-18th century, this [[Tutsi]] royalty consolidated authority over land, production, and distribution with the development of the ''ubugabire''&mdash;a patron-client relationship in which the populace received royal protection in exchange for tribute and land tenure.\n\n=== European contact (1856)===\nEuropean explorers and missionaries made brief visits to the area as early as 1856, and they compared the organization of the kingdom of Burundi with that of the old Greek empire. It was not until 1899 that Burundi became a part of [[German East Africa]].  Unlike the Rwandan monarchy, which decided to accept the German advances, the Burundian king [[Mwezi IV Gisabo of Burundi|Mwezi IV Gisabo]] opposed all European influence, refusing to wear European clothing and resisting the advance of European missionaries or administrators.\n\n=== German East Africa (1899\u20131916) ===\n{{Further|German East Africa}}\n\nThe Germans used armed force and succeeded in doing great damage, but did not destroy the king's power.  Eventually they backed one of the king's sons-in-law [[Maconco]] in a revolt against Gisabo.  Gisabo was eventually forced to concede and agreed to German [[suzerainty]].  The Germans then helped him suppress Maconco's revolt.  The smaller kingdoms along the western shore of [[Lake Victoria]] were also attached to Burundi.\n\nEven after this the foreign presence was minimal and the kings continued to rule much as before. The Europeans did, however, bring devastating diseases affecting both people and animals.  Affecting the entire region, Burundi was especially hard hit.  A great famine hit in 1905, with others striking the entire [[Great Lakes (Africa)|Great Lakes]] region in 1914, 1923 and 1944. Between 1905 and 1914 half the population of the western plains region died.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\n===Belgian and United Nations governance (1916\u20131962) ===\n{{Further|Ruanda-Urundi}}\n\nIn 1916 [[Belgium|Belgian]] troops conquered the area during the [[World War I|First World War]]. In 1923, the [[League of Nations]] mandated to Belgium the territory of [[Ruanda-Urundi]], encompassing modern-day Rwanda and Burundi, but stripping the western kingdoms and giving them to British administered [[Tanganyika]]. The Belgians administered the territory through indirect rule, building on the [[Tutsi]]-dominated aristocratic hierarchy.\n\nFollowing [[World War II]], Ruanda-Urundi became a [[United Nations Trust Territory]] under Belgian administrative authority. \nThe trust territory guidelines required that the trust territories be prepared for independence and majority rule but it wasn't until 10 November 1959 that Belgium committed itself to political reform and legalised the emergence of competing political parties.\n\nOn 20 January 1959, Burundi's ruler [[Mwambutsa IV Bangiriceng of Burundi|Mwami Mwambutsa IV]] requested Burundi's independence from Belgium and dissolution of the Ruanda-Urundi union.<ref name=\"wein7\">{{cite book | last = Weinstein| first = Warren |author2=Robert Schrere | title = Political Conflict and Ethnic Strategies: A Case Study of Burundi| publisher=Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs | year = 1976| location = Syracuse University | isbn = 0-915984-20-2|page=7 }}</ref> In the following months, Burundian political parties began to advocate for the end of Belgian colonial rule and the separation of Rwanda and Burundi.<ref name=\"wein7\" /> The first and largest of these political parties was the [[Union for National Progress]] (UPRONA).

In the context of weak democratic institutions at independence, Tutsi King [[Mwambutsa IV Bangiriceng of Burundi|Mwambutsa IV Bangiriceng]] established a [[constitutional monarchy]] comprising equal numbers of [[Hutu]]s and Tutsis. The 15 January 1965 assassination of the Hutu prime minister [[Pierre Ngendandumwe]] set in motion a series of destabilizing Hutu revolts and subsequent governmental repression.\n\nThese were in part in reaction to Rwanda's \"Social Revolution\" of 1959\u20131961, where Rwandan Tutsi were subject to mass murder by the new government of Hutu [[Gr\u00e9goire Kayibanda]].  In Burundi the Tutsi became committed to ensuring they would not meet the same fate and much of the country's military and police forces became controlled by Tutsis.  Unlike Rwanda, which allied itself with the United States in the [[Cold War]], Burundi after independence became affiliated with [[China]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\nThe monarchy refused to recognize gains by Hutu candidates in the first legislative elections held by Burundi as an independent country on 10 May 1965.  In response, a group of Hutu carried out a [[1965 Burundian coup d'\u00e9tat|failed coup attempt]] against the monarchy on 18 October 1965, which in turn prompted the killing of scores of Hutu politicians and intellectuals.<ref name=\"Lemarchand, 134\">Lemarchand, 134</ref>  On 8 July 1966, King Mwambutsa IV was deposed by his son, Prince [[Ntare V of Burundi|Ntare V]], who himself was deposed by his prime minister Capt. [[Michel Micombero]] on [[November 1966 Burundian coup d'\u00e9tat|28 November 1966]]. Micombero abolished the monarchy and declared a republic. A de facto military regime emerged and civil unrest continued throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}  Micombero headed a clique of ruling Hima, the Tutsi subgroup located in southern Burundi.<ref name=\"Lemarchand, 137\">Lemarchand, 137</ref>  Similar to 1965, rumors of an impending Hutu coup in 1969 prompted the arrest and execution of scores of prominent political and military figures.<ref name=\"Lemarchand, 134\"/>\n\nIn June 1971, a group of [[Banyaruguru]], the socially \"higher up\" subgroup of Tutsi located in the north of the country, were accused of conspiracy by the ruling Hima clique.  On 14 January 1972, a military tribunal sentenced four Banyaruguru officers and five civilians to death, and seven to life imprisonment.  To the Hima concerns about a Hutu uprising or Banyaruguru-led coup was added the return of Ntare V from exile, a potential rallying point for the Hutu majority.<ref name=\"Lemarchand, 137\"/>\n\n=== 1972 genocide ===\n{{main|Ikiza}}\n{{see also|Burundian genocides}}\nOn April 29, there was an outbreak of violence in the south of the country, also the base of the Hima, where bands of roving Hutu committed innumerable atrocities against Tutsi civilians.  All civilian and military authorities in the city of [[Bururi]] were killed and the insurgents then seized the armories in the towns of [[Rumonge]] and [[Nyanza-Lac]].  They then attempted to kill every Tutsi they could, as well as some Hutu who refused to participate in the rebellion, before retreating to [[Vyanda]], near Bururi, and proclaiming a \"Republic of [[Martyazo]].\"<ref name=\"Lemarchand, 136\">Lemarchand, 136</ref>\n\nA week after the insurgent proclamation of a republic, government troops moved in.  Meanwhile, President Micombero declared martial law on May 30 and asked [[Zaire]]an President [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] for assistance.  Congolese paratroopers were deployed to secure the airport while the Burundi army moved into the countryside.  Africanist [[Ren\u00e9 Lemarchand]] notes, \"What followed was not so much a repression as a hideous slaughter of Hutu civilians.  The carnage went on unabated through the month of August.

Although Bagaza led a Tutsi-dominated military regime, he encouraged land reform, electoral reform, and national reconciliation. In 1981, a new constitution was promulgated. In 1984, Bagaza was elected [[head of state]], as the sole candidate. After his election, Bagaza's human rights record deteriorated as he suppressed religious activities and detained political opposition members.\n\nIn 1987, Major [[Pierre Buyoya]] overthrew Col. Bagaza in a [[1987 Burundian coup d'\u00e9tat|military coup d'\u00e9tat]]. He dissolved opposition parties, suspended the 1981 constitution, and instituted his ruling Military Committee for National Salvation (CSMN). During 1988, increasing tensions between the ruling Tutsis and the majority Hutus resulted in violent confrontations between the army, the Hutu opposition, and Tutsi hardliners. During this period, an estimated 150,000 people were killed{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}, with tens of thousands of refugees fleeing to neighboring countries. Buyoya formed a commission to investigate the causes of the 1988 unrest and to develop a charter for democratic reform.\n\nIn 1991, Buyoya approved a constitution that provided for a president, non-ethnic government, and a parliament. Burundi's first Hutu president, [[Melchior Ndadaye]], of the Hutu-dominated [[Front for Democracy in Burundi]] (FRODEBU) Party, was [[Burundian presidential election, 1993|elected]] in 1993.\n\n== 1993 Genocide and Civil War (1993-2005)==\n{{main|Burundi genocide (1993)|Burundi Civil War}}\n[[File:People fleeing during 1993 Burundian genocide.jpg|thumb|People fleeing during 1993 Burundian genocide]]\n\nNdadaye was assassinated three months later, in October 1993, by Tutsi army extremists. The country's situation rapidly declined as Hutu peasants began to rise up and massacre Tutsi. In acts of brutal retribution, the Tutsi army proceeded to round up thousands of Hutu and kill them. The [[Rwandan genocide]] in 1994, sparked by the [[Assassination of Habyarimana and Ntaryamira|killing]] of Ndadaye's successor [[Cyprien Ntaryamira]], further aggravated the conflict in Burundi by sparking additional massacres of Tutsis.\n\nA decade of civil war followed, as the Hutu formed militias in the refugee camps of northern Tanzania. An estimated 300,000 people were killed in clashes and reprisals against the local population, with 550,000 citizens (nine percent of the population) being displaced.<ref>{{cite web |title=Burundi Civil War |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/burundi.htm |date= |publisher=GlobalSecurity.org |accessdate=2009-06-30}}</ref> After the assassination of Ntaryamira, the Hutu presidency and Tutsi military operated under a power-sharing political system until July 1996, when Tutsi [[Pierre Buyoya]] seized power in a [[1996 Burundian coup d'\u00e9tat|military coup]]. Under international pressure, the warring factions negotiated a peace agreement in Arusha in 2000, which called for ethnically balanced military and government and democratic elections.\n\nTwo powerful Hutu rebel groups (the CNDD-FDD and the FNL) refused to sign the peace agreement and fighting continued in the countryside. Finally, the CNDD-FDD agreed to sign a peace deal in November 2003 and joined the transitional government. The last remaining rebel group, the FNL, continued to reject the peace process and committed sporadic acts of violence in 2003 and 2004, finally signing a cease fire agreement in 2006.\n\n== Post-war (2005\u2013present)==\n\nFormer President [[Domitien Ndayizeye]] and his political supporters were arrested in 2006 and accused of plotting a coup, but later he was acquitted by the Supreme Court.

Along with these accusations, in December 2006 the [[International Crisis Group]] labeled Burundi's government with a \"deteriorating\" status in its treatment of human rights. The organization reported that the government had arrested critics, muzzled the press, committed human rights abuses, and tightened its control over the economy, and that \"unless it [reversed] this authoritarian course, it risk[ed] triggering violent unrest and losing the gains of peace process.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Burundi: Democracy and Peace at Risk |url=http://www.crisisgroup.org/home/index.cfm?id=4553&l=1 |date=2006-11-30 |publisher=[[International Crisis Group]] |accessdate=2009-06-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418145649/http://www.crisisgroup.org/home/index.cfm?l=1&id=4553 |archivedate=April 18, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIn February 2007, the [[United Nations]] officially shut down its [[United Nations Operation in Burundi|peacekeeping operations in Burundi]] and turned its attention to rebuilding the nation's economy, which relies heavily on tea and coffee, but which had suffered severely during 12 years of civil war.

On 28 February 2005, however, Burundians popularly approved a post-transitional constitution by national referendum, with elections set to take place throughout the summer of 2005. After local, parliamentary, and other elections in June and July, on 19 August 2005, the good governance minister, [[Pierre Nkurunziza]], became the first post-transitional president.

There are two main founding legends for Burundi.  Both suggest that the nation was founded by a man named [[Cambarantama]]. The legend most promoted today states that he was Rwandan.  The other version, more common in pre-colonial Burundi says that Cambarantama came from the southern state of Buha.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\nThe first evidence of the Burundian state is from 16th century where it emerged on the eastern foothills.  Over the following centuries it expanded, annexing smaller neighbours and competing with Rwanda.  Its greatest growth occurred under [[Ntare IV Rutaganzwa Rugamba]], who ruled the country from about 1796 to 1850 and saw the kingdom double in size.\n\nThe Kingdom of Burundi was characterized by a hierarchical political authority and tributary economic exchange. The king, known as the ''[[mwami]]'' headed a princely [[aristocracy]] (''[[ganwa]]'') which owned most of the land and required a tribute, or tax, from local farmers and herders. In the mid-18th century, this [[Tutsi]] royalty consolidated authority over land, production, and distribution with the development of the ''ubugabire''&mdash;a patron-client relationship in which the populace received royal protection in exchange for tribute and land tenure.\n\n=== European contact (1856)===\nEuropean explorers and missionaries made brief visits to the area as early as 1856, and they compared the organization of the kingdom of Burundi with that of the old Greek empire. It was not until 1899 that Burundi became a part of [[German East Africa]].  Unlike the Rwandan monarchy, which decided to accept the German advances, the Burundian king [[Mwezi IV Gisabo of Burundi|Mwezi IV Gisabo]] opposed all European influence, refusing to wear European clothing and resisting the advance of European missionaries or administrators.\n\n=== German East Africa (1899\u20131916) ===\n{{Further|German East Africa}}\n\nThe Germans used armed force and succeeded in doing great damage, but did not destroy the king\u2019s power.  Eventually they backed one of the king's sons-in-law [[Maconco]] in a revolt against Gisabo.  Gisabo was eventually forced to concede and agreed to German [[suzerainty]].  The Germans then helped him suppress Maconco's revolt.  The smaller kingdoms along the western shore of [[Lake Victoria]] were also attached to Burundi.\n\nEven after this the foreign presence was minimal and the kings continued to rule much as before. The Europeans did, however, bring devastating diseases affecting both people and animals.  Affecting the entire region, Burundi was especially hard hit.  A great famine hit in 1905, with others striking the entire [[Great Lakes (Africa)|Great Lakes]] region in 1914, 1923 and 1944. Between 1905 and 1914 half the population of the western plains region died.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\n===Belgian and United Nations governance (1916\u20131962) ===\n{{Further|Ruanda-Urundi}}\n\nIn 1916 [[Belgium|Belgian]] troops conquered the area during the [[World War I|First World War]].

The Belgians administered the territory through indirect rule, building on the [[Tutsi]]-dominated aristocratic hierarchy.\n\nFollowing [[World War II]], Ruanda-Urundi became a [[United Nations Trust Territory]] under Belgian administrative authority. \nThe trust territory guidelines required that the trust territories be prepared for independence and majority rule but it wasn't until 10 November 1959 that Belgium committed itself to political reform and legalised the emergence of competing political parties.\n\nOn 20 January 1959, Burundi's ruler [[Mwambutsa IV Bangiriceng of Burundi|Mwami Mwambutsa IV]] requested Burundi's independence from Belgium and dissolution of the Ruanda-Urundi union.<ref name=\"wein7\">{{cite book | last = Weinstein| first = Warren |author2=Robert Schrere | title = Political Conflict and Ethnic Strategies: A Case Study of Burundi| publisher=Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs | year = 1976| location = Syracuse University | isbn = 0-915984-20-2|page=7 }}</ref> In the following months, Burundian political parties began to advocate for the end of Belgian colonial rule and the separation of Rwanda and Burundi.<ref name=\"wein7\" /> The first and largest of these political parties was the [[Union for National Progress]] (UPRONA).

In the context of weak democratic institutions at independence, Tutsi King [[Mwambutsa IV Bangiriceng of Burundi|Mwambutsa IV Bangiriceng]] established a [[constitutional monarchy]] comprising equal numbers of [[Hutu]]s and Tutsis. The 15 January 1965 assassination of the Hutu prime minister [[Pierre Ngendandumwe]] set in motion a series of destabilizing Hutu revolts and subsequent governmental repression.\n\nThese were in part in reaction to Rwanda's \"Social Revolution\" of 1959\u20131961, where Rwandan Tutsi were subject to mass murder by the new government of Hutu [[Gr\u00e9goire Kayibanda]].  In Burundi the Tutsi became committed to ensuring they would not meet the same fate and much of the country's military and police forces became controlled by Tutsis.  Unlike Rwanda, which allied itself with the United States in the [[Cold War]], Burundi after independence became affiliated with [[China]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\nThe monarchy refused to recognize gains by Hutu candidates in the first legislative elections held by Burundi as an independent country on 10 May 1965.  In response, a group of Hutu carried out a [[1965 Burundian coup d'\u00e9tat|failed coup attempt]] against the monarchy on 18 October 1965, which in turn prompted the killing of scores of Hutu politicians and intellectuals.<ref name=\"Lemarchand, 134\">Lemarchand, 134</ref>  On 8 July 1966, King Mwambutsa IV was deposed by his son, Prince [[Ntare V of Burundi|Ntare V]], who himself was deposed by his prime minister Capt. [[Michel Micombero]] on [[November 1966 Burundian coup d'\u00e9tat|28 November 1966]]. Micombero abolished the monarchy and declared a republic. A de facto military regime emerged and civil unrest continued throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}  Micombero headed a clique of ruling Hima, the Tutsi subgroup located in southern Burundi.<ref name=\"Lemarchand, 137\">Lemarchand, 137</ref>  Similar to 1965, rumors of an impending Hutu coup in 1969 prompted the arrest and execution of scores of prominent political and military figures.<ref name=\"Lemarchand, 134\"/>\n\nIn June 1971, a group of [[Banyaruguru]], the socially \"higher up\" subgroup of Tutsi located in the north of the country, were accused of conspiracy by the ruling Hima clique.  On 14 January 1972, a military tribunal sentenced four Banyaruguru officers and five civilians to death, and seven to life imprisonment.  To the Hima concerns about a Hutu uprising or Banyaruguru-led coup was added the return of Ntare V from exile, a potential rallying point for the Hutu majority.<ref name=\"Lemarchand, 137\"/>\n\n=== 1972 genocide ===\n{{main|Ikiza}}\n{{see also|Burundian genocides}}\nOn April 29, there was an outbreak of violence in the south of the country, also the base of the Hima, where bands of roving Hutu committed innumerable atrocities against Tutsi civilians.  All civilian and military authorities in the city of [[Bururi]] were killed and the insurgents then seized the armories in the towns of [[Rumonge]] and [[Nyanza-Lac]].  They then attempted to kill every Tutsi they could, as well as some Hutu who refused to participate in the rebellion, before retreating to [[Vyanda]], near Bururi, and proclaiming a \"Republic of [[Martyazo]].\"<ref name=\"Lemarchand, 136\">Lemarchand, 136</ref>\n\nA week after the insurgent proclamation of a republic, government troops moved in.  Meanwhile, President Micombero declared martial law on May 30 and asked [[Zaire]]an President [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] for assistance.  Congolese paratroopers were deployed to secure the airport while the Burundi army moved into the countryside.  Africanist [[Ren\u00e9 Lemarchand]] notes, \"What followed was not so much a repression as a hideous slaughter of Hutu civilians.  The carnage went on unabated through the month of August.

Although Bagaza led a Tutsi-dominated military regime, he encouraged land reform, electoral reform, and national reconciliation. In 1981, a new constitution was promulgated. In 1984, Bagaza was elected [[head of state]], as the sole candidate. After his election, Bagaza's human rights record deteriorated as he suppressed religious activities and detained political opposition members.\n\nIn 1987, Major [[Pierre Buyoya]] overthrew Col. Bagaza in a [[1987 Burundian coup d'\u00e9tat|military coup d'\u00e9tat]]. He dissolved opposition parties, suspended the 1981 constitution, and instituted his ruling Military Committee for National Salvation (CSMN). During 1988, increasing tensions between the ruling Tutsis and the majority Hutus resulted in violent confrontations between the army, the Hutu opposition, and Tutsi hardliners. During this period, an estimated 150,000 people were killed{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}, with tens of thousands of refugees fleeing to neighboring countries. Buyoya formed a commission to investigate the causes of the 1988 unrest and to develop a charter for democratic reform.\n\nIn 1991, Buyoya approved a constitution that provided for a president, non-ethnic government, and a parliament. Burundi's first Hutu president, [[Melchior Ndadaye]], of the Hutu-dominated [[Front for Democracy in Burundi]] (FRODEBU) Party, was [[Burundian presidential election, 1993|elected]] in 1993.\n\n== 1993 Genocide and Civil War (1993-2005)==\n{{main|Burundi genocide (1993)|Burundi Civil War}}\n[[File:People fleeing during 1993 Burundian genocide.jpg|thumb|People fleeing during 1993 Burundian genocide]]\n\nNdadaye was assassinated three months later, in October 1993, by Tutsi army extremists. The country\u2019s situation rapidly declined as Hutu peasants began to rise up and massacre Tutsi. In acts of brutal retribution, the Tutsi army proceeded to round up thousands of Hutu and kill them. The [[Rwandan genocide]] in 1994, sparked by the [[Assassination of Habyarimana and Ntaryamira|killing]] of Ndadaye\u2019s successor [[Cyprien Ntaryamira]], further aggravated the conflict in Burundi by sparking additional massacres of Tutsis.\n\nA decade of civil war followed, as the Hutu formed militias in the refugee camps of northern Tanzania. An estimated 300,000 people were killed in clashes and reprisals against the local population, with 550,000 citizens (nine percent of the population) being displaced.<ref>{{cite web |title=Burundi Civil War |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/burundi.htm |date= |publisher=GlobalSecurity.org |accessdate=2009-06-30}}</ref> After the assassination of Ntaryamira, the Hutu presidency and Tutsi military operated under a power-sharing political system until July 1996, when Tutsi [[Pierre Buyoya]] seized power in a [[1996 Burundian coup d'\u00e9tat|military coup]]. Under international pressure, the warring factions negotiated a peace agreement in Arusha in 2000, which called for ethnically balanced military and government and democratic elections.\n\nTwo powerful Hutu rebel groups (the CNDD-FDD and the FNL) refused to sign the peace agreement and fighting continued in the countryside. Finally, the CNDD-FDD agreed to sign a peace deal in November 2003 and joined the transitional government. The last remaining rebel group, the FNL, continued to reject the peace process and committed sporadic acts of violence in 2003 and 2004, finally signing a cease fire agreement in 2006.\n\n== Post-war (2005\u2013present)==\n\nFormer President [[Domitien Ndayizeye]] and his political supporters were arrested in 2006 and accused of plotting a coup, but later he was acquitted by the Supreme Court.

{"title_page": "Object-relational mapping", "text_new": "{{Distinguish|Object-role modeling}}\n{{Refimprove|date=May 2009}}\n\n'''Object-relational mapping''' ('''ORM''', '''O/RM''', and '''O/R mapping tool''') in [[computer science]] is a [[Computer programming|programming]] technique for converting data between incompatible [[type system]]s using [[object-oriented]] programming languages. This creates, in effect, a \"virtual [[object database]]\" that can be used from within the programming language. There are both free and commercial packages available that perform object-relational mapping, although some programmers opt to construct their own ORM tools.\n\nIn [[object-oriented programming]], [[data management|data-management]] tasks act on [[object (computer science)|object]]s that are almost always non-[[scalar (computing)|scalar]] values. For example, an address book entry that represents a single person along with zero or more phone numbers and zero or more addresses. This could be modeled in an object-oriented implementation by a \"Person [[Object (computer science)|object]]\" with [[attribute (computing)|attributes/fields]] to hold each data item that the entry comprises: the person's name, a list of phone numbers, and a list of addresses. The list of phone numbers would itself contain \"PhoneNumber objects\" and so on. The address-book entry is treated as a single object by the programming language (it can be referenced by a single variable containing a pointer to the object, for instance). Various methods can be associated with the object, such as a method to return the preferred phone number, the home address, and so on.\n\nHowever, many popular database products such as [[SQL]] [[database management system]]s (DBMS) can only store and manipulate [[Scalar (computing)|scalar]] values such as integers and strings organized within [[Table (database)|tables]]. The programmer must either convert the object values into groups of simpler values for storage in the database (and convert them back upon retrieval), or only use simple scalar values within the program. Object-relational mapping implements the first approach.<ref name=hibernate-orm-overview>\n{{cite web\n|title= What is Object/Relational Mapping?\n|url= http://www.hibernate.org/about/orm\n|work= Hibernate Overview\n|publisher= JBOSS Hibernate\n|accessdate= 19 April 2011\n}}\n</ref>\n\nThe heart of the problem involves translating the logical representation of the objects into an atomized form that is capable of being stored in the database while preserving the properties of the objects and their relationships so that they can be reloaded as objects when needed. If this storage and retrieval functionality is implemented, the objects are said to be [[persistence (computer science)|persistent]].<ref name=hibernate-orm-overview />\n\n==Overview==\nImplementation-specific details of storage drivers are generally wrapped in an API in the programming language in use, exposing methods to interact with the storage medium in a way which is simpler and more in line with the paradigms of surrounding code.\n\nThe following is a simple example, written in [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] code, to execute a query written in [[SQL]] using a database engine.\n\n<source lang=\"csharp\">\nvar sql = \"SELECT id, first_name, last_name, phone, birth_date, sex, age FROM persons WHERE id = 10\";\nvar result = context.Persons.FromSqlRaw(sql).ToList();\nvar name = result[0][\"first_name\"];\n</source>\n\nIn contrast, the following makes use of an ORM-job API, allowing the writing of code which naturally makes use of the features of the language.\n\n<source lang=\"csharp\">\nvar person = repository.GetPerson(10);\nvar firstName = person.GetFirstName();\n</source>\n\nThe case above makes use of an object representing the storage repository and methods of that object. Other frameworks might provide code as static methods, as in the below, and yet other methods may not implement an object-oriented system at all. Often the choice of paradigm is made to fit the ORM best into the surrounding language's design principles.\n\n<source lang=\"csharp\">\nvar person = Person.Get(10);\n</source>\n\nUsually, the framework will expose some filtering and querying functionality, allowing subsets of the storage base to be accessed and modified. The code below queries for people in the database whose ID value is '10'.\n\n<source lang=\"csharp\">\nvar person = Person.Get(Person.Properties.Id == 10);\n</source>\n\n==Comparison with traditional data access techniques==\nCompared to traditional techniques of exchange between an object-oriented language and a relational database, ORM often reduces the amount of code that needs to be written.<ref>Douglas Barry, Torsten Stanienda, \"Solving the Java Object Storage Problem,\" Computer, vol. 31, no. 11, pp. 33-40, Nov. 1998, [http://www2.computer.org/portal/web/csdl/doi/10.1109/2.730734 http://www2.computer.org/portal/web/csdl/doi/10.1109/2.730734 ], Excerpt at http://www.service-architecture.com/object-relational-mapping/articles/transparent_persistence_vs_jdbc_call-level_interface.html.

OODBMSs are databases designed specifically for working with object-oriented values. Using an OODBMS eliminates the need for converting data to and from its SQL form, as the data is stored in its original object representation and relationships are directly represented, rather than requiring [[junction table|join tables]]/operations. The equivalent of ORMs for [[document-oriented database]]s are called object-document mappers (ODMs).\n\nDocument-oriented databases also prevent the user from having to \"shred\" objects into table rows.  Many of these systems also support the [[XQuery]] query language to retrieve datasets.\n\nObject-oriented databases tend to be used in complex, niche applications. One of the arguments against using an OODBMS is that it may not be able to execute ad-hoc, application-independent queries.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} For this reason, many programmers find themselves more at home with an object-SQL mapping system, even though most object-oriented databases are able to process SQL queries to a limited extent.

Diagenetic [[Siderite]] intercalations and concretions, ~20 cm thick, as well as [[Pyrite]] concretions are also present.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> The mineralization \nof Siderite occurs in all types of Ciechocinek Formation deposits. Include fine crystalline variety, coarse crystalline rhombohedra and fine crystalline aggregates impregnated by mixture of un de termined Fehydroxides.<ref name=\"Leonowicz0\"/> The mineralization of the siedrites on certain layers is associated to the abundance of organic matter, with the deacay of it ending on a progressive carbonate supersaturation, with an early precipitation on the nucleous of the siderites. They reflect also the conditions of salinity on the water, showing alternances in short periods, associated with the abundance of organic matter.<ref name=\"Leonowicz0\"/> Muds and mudstones consist mainly of particles with the size of common clay, some with admixture of silt; sandy muds and mudstones are also encountered in counterpart to thepure clays and claystones, without admixtures of other fractions, that are from rare o extremely rare. Mudstones are porrly consolidated, tren to desintegration, swell and become plastic, being the only exceptional ones those the heavy sideritic mudstones, that range froma wide variety of colors, from  brown or cherry-red in colour, with an olive shade often appearing.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> On the other hand there are abundant poorly consolidated [[Quartz]] sandstones, that are regularly intercalated with [[Silt]] and [[Siltstone]].<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> Along the Sandstones, there are [[Chlorite]] and [[Kaolinite]] grains. Plant microremains are common, concentrated with mica flakes on lamination planes, while larger wood fragments, several cm long, are also moderately frequent.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> Heavy minerals are present and include as the most common [[Euhedral]] forms such as [[Zircon]], [[Rutile]] and [[Tourmaline]], along with angular fragments of [[Rutile]], [[Garnet]] and [[Staurolite]], with finally well-rounded oval grains of Zircon, Rutile, Garnet and Tourmaline. Outside the main heavy minerals, it is possible to find well-rounded grains of green [[Hornblende]], [[Apatite]], [[Disthene]], [[Epidote]], and finally on one study one [[Pyroxene]] grain was found.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> The presence of [[Kaolinite]], related to continental formation in tropical climate environments for the chemical weathering of different igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks, along with [[Chlorite]] & [[Biotite]], suggest a deposition linked to fluvial & deltaic forces. The eastern Sudetes and their foreland are the best candidates for be the origin of the transported material, as they have a nearly identical composition, being the Lower Jurassic deposits in the [[Fore-Sudetic Monocline]] linked [[Cracow-Cz\u00eastochowa Monocline]], with the strata of the Formation.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> \n\n===Stratigraphy===\n[[File:Wapienno - kamienio\u0142omy Cementowni Kujawy - Lafarge Cement 2009.JPG|thumb|250px|left|[[Wapienno]] Cement Quarry, with exposed strata of the Formation.]]\nDeposits of the Ciechocinek Formation are related to a brackish-marine origin, being  deposited in an epicontinental sedimentary basin on Poland, that was the eastern arm of the Mid-European [[Toarcian]] Basin.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/>  The main component of the deposits are muds,  intercalate sandstones & silts disposed on a high variety of structures, with at least twelve lithofacies that run from fine-grained sedimentations to wave dominated [[Sandy Shoal]]s. It is believed that the dominat sedimentation was by quiet [[Mud]] and silt sedimentation from suspension, which probably come from near [[River Mouths]].  It was a sedimentary basin with a continuous influx of [[Clay]] and fine [[Silt]], to which sand was brought by events such as river transportation, storms, eustatic effects, and other related.<ref name=\"Leonowicz1\">Leonowicz, P.

The presence of alluvial sedimentation still on the nearshore environments, as an effect probably related to Floods.<ref name=\"Leonowicz1\"/> On some layers \nis observed that the chemistry of the sea water was changing as the deposition continue on the most recent layers of the Ciechocinek Formation, impliying the possible formation of a brackish environment, probably due to the sedimentation of fluvial currents. Mostly of the Invertebrate traces reported from the formation, come from this layers.<ref name=\"Leonowicz1\"/> On the upper levels of the formation there is a clear change in the sedimentation: a sea regression with a paulatine alluvial progradation.

Outside the main heavy minerals, it is possible to find well-rounded grains of green [[Hornblende]], [[Apatite]], [[Disthene]], [[Epidote]], and finally on one study one [[Pyroxene]] grain was found.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> The presence of [[Kaolinite]], related to continental formation in tropical climate environments for the chemical weathering of different igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks, along with [[Chlorite]] & [[Biotite]], suggest a deposition linked to fluvial & deltaic forces. The eastern Sudetes and their foreland are the best candidates for be the origin of the transported material, as they have a nearly identical composition, being the Lower Jurassic deposits in the [[Fore-Sudetic Monocline]] linked [[Cracow-Cz\u00eastochowa Monocline]], with the strata of the Formation.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> \n\n===Stratigraphy===\n[[File:Wapienno - kamienio\u0142omy Cementowni Kujawy - Lafarge Cement 2009.JPG|thumb|250px|left|[[Wapienno]] Cement Quarry, with exposed strata of the Formation.]]\nDeposits of the Ciechocinek Formation are related to a brackish-marine origin, being  deposited in an epicontinental sedimentary basin on Poland, that was the eastern arm of the Mid-European [[Toarcian]] Basin.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/>  The main component of the deposits are muds,  intercalate sandstones & silts disposed on a high variety of structures, with at least twelve lithofacies that run from fine-grained sedimentations to wave dominated [[Sandy Shoal]]s. It is believed that the dominat sedimentation was by quiet [[Mud]] and silt sedimentation from suspension, which probably come from near [[River Mouths]].  It was a sedimentary basin with a continuous influx of [[Clay]] and fine [[Silt]], to which sand was brought by events such as river transportation, storms, eustatic effects, and other related.<ref name=\"Leonowicz1\">Leonowicz, P.

Acta Geologica Polonica, 61(2), 215-241.</ref> There is a detailed succession of changes in the strata with time, where the location of the river mouths shifted because of effects such as the progradation of deltas, the stop of the flux of river channels and the long-lasting esutatic sea-level changes, all of that can be confirmed by the presence of microstructures as result of erosion and cross lamination in the mud-silt facies.<ref name=\"Leonowicz1\"/> A [[Marine Transgression]] correlated to the rise of the sea level on the Lower Toarcian is crearly visible on the [[Silesian-Cracow]] area, where the sea encroached the [[Polish Trough]], which resulted in the end of the [[Pliensbachian]] alluvial sedimentation, that can be observed on the underliying [[Blanowice Formation]]. The presence of alluvial sedimentation still on the nearshore environments, as an effect probably related to Floods.<ref name=\"Leonowicz1\"/> On some layers \nis observed that the chemistry of the sea water was changing as the deposition continue on the most recent layers of the Ciechocinek Formation, impliying the possible formation of a brackish environment, probably due to the sedimentation of fluvial currents. Mostly of the Invertebrate traces reported from the formation, come from this layers.<ref name=\"Leonowicz1\"/> On the upper levels of the formation there is a clear change in the sedimentation: a sea regression with a paulatine alluvial progradation. The sea left seashore lakes, lagoons, deltas, Mangrooves, with the emergence of the land confirmed by the occurrence of plant roots and [[Desiccation Cracks]].<ref name=\"Leonowicz1\"/>\n\n==Paleoenvironment==\n[[File:Ciechocinek Formation Reconstruction.jpg|thumb|450px|left|Environment reconstruction of the Polish realm, based on several footprints, fragmentary specimens and fossil plants reported]]\n\nThe presence of verdine{{what|date=April 2020}} facies in modern Polish Realm is vinculated to an ancient ironstone paleoenvironment, with shallow marine facies that expose carence of iron.<ref name=Leonowicz></ref> The occurrence of this type of deposit in modern strata is vinculated to intertropical regions on the vicinity of river mouths. Those relation made attribute the strata to a deposition on a warm and really humid climate, with  brackish-marine environments  consisting of [[Lagoon]]s, [[Embayment]]s, [[Estuarie]]s, [[Mangrove]]s, low-energy deltas and near sandwave fields or barrier islands, similar to modern [[Caribe]] islands and seashore environments.<ref name=Leonowicz></ref> The humidity of the environments was probed by the presence of several fossils and minerals on the strata outside the measurements of the iron precipitation.
