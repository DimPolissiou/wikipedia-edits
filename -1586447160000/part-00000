Chloroquine caps hemozoin molecules to prevent further [[biocrystallization]] of heme, thus leading to heme buildup.

They effectively neutralize the drug via a mechanism that drains chloroquine away from the digestive vacuole. Chloroquine-resistant cells efflux chloroquine at 40 times the rate of chloroquine-sensitive cells; the related mutations trace back to transmembrane proteins of the digestive vacuole, including sets of critical mutations in the ''P. falciparum'' chloroquine resistance transporter (''PfCRT'') gene.

Digestion is carried out in a vacuole of the parasitic cell.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nHemoglobin is composed of a protein unit (digested by the parasite) and a heme unit (not used by the parasite). During this process, the parasite releases the toxic and soluble molecule [[heme]]. The heme moiety consists of a porphyrin ring called Fe(II)-protoporphyrin IX (FP). To avoid destruction by this molecule, the parasite biocrystallizes heme to form [[hemozoin]], a nontoxic molecule. Hemozoin collects in the digestive vacuole as insoluble crystals.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nChloroquine enters the red blood cell by simple diffusion, inhibiting the parasite cell and digestive vacuole. Chloroquine then becomes protonated (to CQ2+), as the digestive vacuole is known to be acidic (pH 4.7); chloroquine then cannot leave by diffusion. Chloroquine caps hemozoin molecules to prevent further [[biocrystallization]] of heme, thus leading to heme buildup. Chloroquine binds to heme (or FP) to form the FP-chloroquine complex; this complex is highly toxic to the cell and disrupts membrane function. Action of the toxic FP-chloroquine and FP results in cell lysis and ultimately parasite cell autodigestion.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hempelmann E | title = Hemozoin biocrystallization in Plasmodium falciparum and the antimalarial activity of crystallization inhibitors | journal = Parasitology Research | volume = 100 | issue = 4 | pages = 671\u20136 | date = March 2007 | pmid = 17111179 | doi = 10.1007/s00436-006-0313-x }}</ref> Parasites that do not form hemozoin are therefore resistant to chloroquine.<ref name=\"Lin2015\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lin JW, Spaccapelo R, Schwarzer E, Sajid M, Annoura T, Deroost K, Ravelli RB, Aime E, Capuccini B, Mommaas-Kienhuis AM, O'Toole T, Prins F, Franke-Fayard BM, Ramesar J, Chevalley-Maurel S, Kroeze H, Koster AJ, Tanke HJ, Crisanti A, Langhorne J, Arese P, Van den Steen PE, Janse CJ, Khan SM | display-authors = 6 | title = Replication of Plasmodium in reticulocytes can occur without hemozoin formation, resulting in chloroquine resistance | journal = The Journal of Experimental Medicine | volume = 212 | issue = 6 | pages = 893\u2013903 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 25941254 | pmc = 4451122 | doi = 10.1084/jem.20141731 | url = https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/500975/3/2015113.pdf | access-date = 4 November 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170922103013/https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/500975/3/2015113.pdf | archive-date = 22 September 2017 | url-status = live }}</ref>\n\n==== Resistance in malaria ====\nSince the first documentation of ''P. falciparum'' chloroquine resistance in the 1950s, resistant strains have appeared throughout East and West Africa, Southeast Asia, and South America. The effectiveness of chloroquine against ''P. falciparum'' has declined as resistant strains of the parasite evolved. They effectively neutralize the drug via a mechanism that drains chloroquine away from the digestive vacuole. Chloroquine-resistant cells efflux chloroquine at 40 times the rate of chloroquine-sensitive cells; the related mutations trace back to transmembrane proteins of the digestive vacuole, including sets of critical mutations in the ''P. falciparum'' chloroquine resistance transporter (''PfCRT'') gene. The mutated protein, but not the wild-type transporter, transports chloroquine when expressed in ''[[Xenopus]]'' oocytes (frog's eggs) and is thought to mediate chloroquine leak from its site of action in the digestive vacuole.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Martin RE, Marchetti RV, Cowan AI, Howitt SM, Br\u00f6er S, Kirk K | title = Chloroquine transport via the malaria parasite's chloroquine resistance transporter | journal = Science | volume = 325 | issue = 5948 | pages = 1680\u20132 | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19779197 | doi = 10.1126/science.1175667 | bibcode = 2009Sci...325.1680M }}</ref> Resistant parasites also frequently have mutated products of the [[ABC transporter]] ''P. falciparum'' multidrug resistance (''PfMDR1'') gene, although these mutations are thought to be of secondary importance compared to ''Pfcrt''.
