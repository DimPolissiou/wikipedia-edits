The Bullets did not draft him, but Krause continued to keep in touch during Jackson's playing career and into his first years as a coach. Their relationship flourished during the 1970s and 1980s; notably, when Jackson was coaching the [[Albany Patroons]] in the [[Continental Basketball Association]], Krause once called him requesting an analysis of the league's players, which Jackson provided in great detail.<ref>Halberstam, ''Playing for Keeps'', p. 198.</ref>\n\nAfter a few years with Baltimore, Krause worked as a scout with the [[Phoenix Suns]], [[Philadelphia 76ers]], [[Los Angeles Lakers]] and [[Chicago Bulls]] in the 1970s before he left pro basketball to scout pro baseball instead. He was scouting for the [[Chicago White Sox]] when he received a call from new [[Chicago Bulls]] owner [[Jerry Reinsdorf]] to join the Bulls as their new General Manager and once again work in pro basketball.\n\n==Chicago Bulls==\nKrause succeeded [[Rod Thorn]] as [[Chicago Bulls]] GM in 1985, and managed the franchise as [[Michael Jordan]] and [[Phil Jackson]] ascended to elite status in their respective positions.\n\n===Drafting===\nJerry made a number of moves on being named GM that immediately began building the foundation for the team that would dominate the 1990s. He traded away undesirable players, turned over the Bulls roster and built up a collection of draft picks that would result in 2 significant additions to the team in 1987. Krause found two gems in the 1987 draft: [[Scottie Pippen]], a small forward from the [[University of Central Arkansas]]; and [[Horace Grant]], a power forward from [[Clemson University|Clemson]]. The two were, along with Jordan, cornerstones of the Bulls' 1991\u20131993 championship teams.<ref name=\"Halberstam, p. 200\">Halberstam, ''Playing for Keeps'', p. 200.</ref>  They were also culled from relative hoops obscurity; this went back to Krause's strength for finding players who were not well-received or even known by mainstream scouts.\n\nHowever, Krause also made many picks that did not help the team. In 1986, Krause planned on selecting a tall forward named [[Brad Sellers]] in the NBA Draft. Sellers, Krause reasoned, was too good a pick to pass up, as he handled the ball very well for a big man, and also had a solid outside jumper. Jordan, on the other hand, pushed management to take a two-way guard from [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]] named [[Johnny Dawkins]]. It looked as though Krause would take Dawkins even as late as the morning of the draft; the coaches and players had made it clear that they wanted him and not Sellers, and Krause did not particularly have a problem with Dawkins' game. The Bulls' head coach at the time, [[Doug Collins (basketball)|Doug Collins]], even told Duke coach [[Mike Krzyzewski]] the night before the draft that the team would pick Dawkins. However, Krause ignored everyone and picked Sellers anyway, and spent the summer trying to sell him to Jordan. Jordan went after Sellers mercilessly in practice, and Sellers was traded after three seasons. He played six total seasons in the NBA, averaging 6.3 points per game. Dawkins played for nine seasons in the NBA and averaged 11.1 points per game, though he did suffer from various injuries throughout his career.\n\nSellers was one of many Krause draft picks to underperform; others included [[Stacey King]], [[Mark Randall (basketball)|Mark Randall]], [[Will Perdue]] and [[Marcus Fizer]]. King and Perdue would serve as backup players on the Bulls' 1991\u20131993 Championship teams, but both players would later be traded away. During the 1993\u201394 NBA season, King was traded to the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]] in exchange for 7'2\" Australian-born center [[Luc Longley]].<ref name=\"longley\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/bulls/history/alltime_transactions.html|title=Chicago Bulls All-Time Transactions|work=www.nba.com|accessdate=August 28, 2009}}</ref> Longley's emergence for the Bulls during the 1994\u201395 season made Perdue expendable. Just before the start of the 1995\u201396 season, Perdue was traded to the [[San Antonio Spurs]] for [[Dennis Rodman]].\n\n===The Oakley trade===\nKrause made another transaction in 1988 to which Jordan strongly objected. It was clear that the Bulls needed a center if they were to contend for a title, so Krause dealt [[Charles Oakley]] to New York for [[Bill Cartwright]]. Oakley, who happened to be Jordan's best friend on the team,<ref name=\"Halberstam, p. 246\">Halberstam, ''Playing for Keeps'', p. 246.</ref> was extremely tough, particularly on the boards and on defense. When the Pistons came after Jordan with their physical players, Oakley was his bodyguard. Cartwright was a true center, unlike the power forward Oakley, but was much older. Although Cartwright did not have Oakley's reputation as a lockdown defender, he was very effective at preventing opposing centers from dominating games,<ref>Halberstam, ''Playing for Keeps'', p. 279-80.</ref> and was a more capable inside scorer. Jordan despised the trade, not only because of the players involved but also because of how they learned of it: via television, while he and Oakley were on their way to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] to see a [[Mike Tyson]] fight.<ref name=\"Halberstam, p. 200\"/> Cartwright turned out to be everything the Bulls needed, however, providing a presence in the middle for all three Bulls championships from 1991\u20131993. Perhaps most importantly, Cartwright proved to be the league's best center at defending [[Patrick Ewing]], the [[New York Knicks]]' star who was the key player on the Bulls' most important early-1990s conference rival.<ref name=\"Halberstam, p. 246\"/>\n\nOne of the most notable ways was demonstrated in the [[Basketball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Olympics]], when the [[1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team|Dream Team]], including Jordan and Pippen, took on [[Croatia national basketball team|Croatia]] for the gold medal. The Croatia team featured [[Toni Kuko\u010d]], a young star whom Krause had discovered through European contacts and was courting to a degree that some of the Bulls found annoying.<ref>Halberstam, ''Playing for Keeps'', p. 288-89.</ref> Jordan biographer [[David Halberstam]] said that Jordan and Pippen \"seemed to play against Kukoc as if they had a vendetta\", and that \"in the end, it was as if they had been playing not against Kukoc but against Krause.\"<ref name=\"Halberstam, p. 289\">Halberstam, ''Playing for Keeps'', p. 289.</ref> Jordan would later be quoted as saying: \"The trade of Oakley was good, and the best thing he did was to get Pippen and Grant. That's it. His claim to fame is that he drafted [[Earl Monroe]] for the Bullets. And I say to him, 'What pick was that?' He says, 'Two.' And I say, 'Hell! Earl Monroe was a real secret, huh? A real secret? If you hadn't taken him, he'd have gone third!'\"<ref>{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/multimedia/photo_gallery/0605/gallery.toxic/content.13.html | work=CNN | title=SI.com}}</ref>\n\nJordan later admitted that he may have been wrong and Krause may have been right about the trade for Cartwright,<ref>Halberstam, ''Playing for Keeps'', p. 247.</ref> but it changed nothing about Jordan's overall distrust and loathing for Krause. These feelings came to the surface in many different ways, including Jordan nicknaming Krause \"Crumbs\" in reference to his morbid obesity and slovenly appearance, as well as having doughnut residue on his clothes.<ref>[http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/rosenblog/ct-jerry-krause-deserved-better-rosenbloom-20170321-column.html]</ref>\n\n===Rebuilding after the first retirement of Jordan===\nThe first retirement of Jordan, following the 1993 NBA season, brought massive change to the Chicago Bulls roster. Krause attempted to replace Jordan with defensive specialist [[Pete Myers]] and free agent [[Ron Harper]], but neither proved capable of leading Chicago to a championship, although Harper would play an invaluable role in the second \"three-peat\". Just before Jordan announced his retirement, Krause was finally able to persuade Kuko\u010d to buy himself out of his European contract and join the Bulls.<ref name=\"Halberstam, p. 289\"/> The 1993\u201394 Bulls made it to the conference semi-finals, where they lost to the New York Knicks in seven games. The Bulls had beaten the Knicks in the playoffs the three previous years.\n\nWhen Jordan returned to the NBA at the end of the 1995 season, Krause once again went to work in assembling what has been labeled the best team in NBA history after offseason acquisition of [[Dennis Rodman]] from the Spurs. The Bulls won a then-NBA record 72 games and Krause was named [[NBA Executive of the Year Award|Executive of the Year]] for the second time. The next year, they achieved a then second best-ever NBA season with 69 wins and repeated as champions.\n\n===\"The Last Dance\"===\nKrause and head coach [[Phil Jackson]] had been friends for years, but their relationship was, in Jackson's opinion, shattered early in the 1990s after ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' reporter Sam Smith (whom Krause despised) published a book on the 1991 title team, ''[[The Jordan Rules (book)|The Jordan Rules]]''. The book detailed the tension that already existed between Krause and the players, and ultimately drove a wedge between Krause and Jackson.<ref>Halberstam, ''Playing for Keeps'', p. 311-15.</ref> Regardless of the success Jackson had as head coach of the Bulls, the tension between Jackson and Krause grew in the succeeding years, and by the 1997\u201398 season, was especially illustrated by the following incidents:\n\n*During the summer of 1997, Krause's stepdaughter got married. All of the Bulls assistant coaches and their wives were invited to the wedding, as was [[Tim Floyd]], then the head coach at [[Iowa State Cyclones men's basketball|Iowa State]], whom Krause was openly courting as Jackson's successor (and who would eventually succeed Jackson). Jackson and his then wife, June, were not even told of the wedding, much less invited, only finding out about the event when the wife of Cartwright, who by that time had become a Bulls assistant, asked June what she would be wearing to the reception.<ref>Halberstam, ''Playing for Keeps'', p. 249.</ref>\n*After contentious negotiations between Jackson and the Bulls in that same period, Jackson was signed for the 1997\u201398 season only. Krause announced the signing in what Chicago media widely considered to be a mean-spirited manner, emphasizing that Jackson would not be rehired even if the Bulls won the 1997\u201398 title. That triggered an argument between Jackson and Krause in which Jackson essentially told Krause that he seemed to be rooting for the other side and not the Bulls. At that point, Krause told Jackson, \"I don't care if it's 82-and-0 this year, you're fucking gone.\"<ref>Halberstam, ''Playing for Keeps'', p. 41. The \"82\" refers to the number of regular-season games each NBA team plays.</ref>\n*Krause publicly portrayed Jackson as a two-faced character who had very little regard for his assistant coaches, a perception that certain Krause associates in the Bulls organization had sought to spread about Jackson. At the height of the hard feelings in the spring of 1998, one of Krause's scouts went to press row in Chicago's [[United Center]] to explain to a reporter the insidious nature of Jackson's ego (excerpt from the Phil Jackson biography ''Mindgames'').\n*On the eve of the 1998 season, Krause said his most famous, and most misquoted, statement: \"Players and coaches don\u2019t win championships. Organizations do,\" which was often paraphrased to \u201cOrganizations win championships.\"  Years later in an interview with Adrian Wojnarowski of Yahoo! Sports, Krause clarified the statement, making \"the point was that the Bulls were more than one great player,\". The Bulls won championships four, five, and six \"not just because they had the best player but because they had the best second-best player and the best rebounder and the best sixth man and the best pure shooter and the best coach and, yes, the best general manager\". Krause said that the championships were also due to his team \"[having] the best marketers. The best trainers. The best salary cap guru,\" personnel who rarely got credit compared to players and coaches.<ref name=\"blogabull.com\">[https://www.blogabull.com/2017/3/24/15044772/the-true-story-of-jerry-krause-breakup-of-the-bulls-michael-jordan-phil-jackson-scottie-pippen]</ref>\n\nAfter the Bulls' final title of the [[Michael Jordan|Jordan]] era in 1998, Jackson left the team vowing never to coach again, but after he took a year off he decided to give it another chance with the Lakers. Longtime friend of Krause and Bulls assistant coach [[Tex Winter]], who was the architect of the triangle offense,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.hoopshype.com/blogs/lazenby/category/jerry-krause/ |title=Jerry Krause dies &#124; HoopsHype |publisher=Blogs.hoopshype.com |date= |accessdate=2017-03-22}}</ref> stayed with the Bulls for another full season, leaving the organization in the summer of 1999, when Phil Jackson was hired to coach the [[Los Angeles Lakers]]. Krause said that he had not spoken to Jackson since. When Jordan was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2009, Krause was not in attendance. Krause said he would not attend the ceremony because of his personal boycott of the Hall of Fame over their refusal to induct Winter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/nba/news/story?id=4464526|title=Krause passes on MJ's induction on principle|date=September 12, 2009|publisher=|accessdate=March 22, 2017}}</ref> Krause and Jackson briefly put their differences aside when Winter was finally inducted two years later.

He took the job for the money\".<ref>[http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/19759358/nba-phil-jackson-biggest-failure-was-letting-game-pass-by]</ref>\n\n==Rebuilding==\nDeciding that the Bulls were aging and facing an uncertain future, Krause chose to unload the veterans and rebuild. Few major players were added though (other than from drafts).<ref name=\"blogabull.com\"/>\n\n===Younger talent===\nThe draft brought prolific collegiate players such as [[Elton Brand]], [[Ron Artest]], [[Marcus Fizer]], [[Jamal Crawford]], and [[Jay Williams (basketball)|Jay Williams]] to the Bulls but it would be the 2001 draft that stood out. After finishing 15\u201367 during the 2000\u20132001 season, Krause decided to gamble and trade away his best player in Brand for high schooler [[Tyson Chandler]] who was hyped as \"the next Kevin Garnett\", and draft another high schooler in [[Eddy Curry]] who, similarly, was hyped as a slightly smaller version of [[Shaquille O'Neal]], with the fourth overall pick in the draft.\n\nKrause believed that the tandem of Chandler and Curry would develop into elite players and provide the foundation for another dynasty. A mid-season trade the following year brought scorer [[Jalen Rose]] to the Bulls in exchange for [[Brad Miller (basketball player)|Brad Miller]] and Artest which cleared playing time for the two rookies. After drafting Jay Williams during the offseason, the Bulls had a roster with Rose, Crawford, Curry, Chandler, Williams, and Fizer that fulfilled Krause's dream of a talented young athletic team. The Bulls showed some improvement the following year.\n\n===Retirement and death===\nIn 2003, Krause retired as GM. The official explanation involved obesity-related health problems.<ref>{{Cite news| url =https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/08/sports/basketball-bulls-builder-krause-resigns-after-18-years.html |title=Bulls Builder Krause Resigns After 18 Years|author=Liz Robbins|work=[[The New York Times]] |date = April 8, 2003}}</ref> The Bulls fell to 23\u201359 in the next season, and Krause's dream of a talented young athletic team imploded with all of his acquisitions traded or out of the league within three years.

Meanwhile, former players [[Elton Brand|Brand]], [[Brad Miller (basketball)|Miller]], [[Ron Artest|Artest]], and [[Tyson Chandler|Chandler]] became All-Stars for their new teams.\n\nKrause went back to his roots and worked briefly for the [[New York Yankees]] [[baseball]] team as a scout, before joining the [[New York Mets]] in 2005.<ref>Fred Mitchell. \"[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/831850991.html?dids=831850991:831850991&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=May+04%2C+2005&author=Fred+Mitchell%2C+Tribune+staff+reporter&pub=Chicago+Tribune&desc=Krause+prefers+silent+approach+to+scouting&pqatl=google Krause prefers silent approach to scouting]\".

He is credited by some for discovering future Hall of Famer [[Earl Monroe]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Halberstam |first=David |authorlink=David Halberstam |title=Playing for Keeps: Michael Jordan and the World He Made |year=1999 |publisher=Random House |location=New York City |isbn=0-679-41562-9 |page=[https://archive.org/details/playingforkeepsm00halb/page/196 196] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/playingforkeepsm00halb/page/196 }}</ref>\n\nWhile with the Bullets, he urged the team to pick [[North Dakota Fighting Sioux|North Dakota]] forward [[Phil Jackson]] in the [[1967 NBA draft]]. The Bullets did not draft him, but Krause continued to keep in touch during Jackson's playing career and into his first years as a coach. Their relationship flourished during the 1970s and 1980s; notably, when Jackson was coaching the [[Albany Patroons]] in the [[Continental Basketball Association]], Krause once called him requesting an analysis of the league's players, which Jackson provided in great detail.<ref>Halberstam, ''Playing for Keeps'', p. 198.</ref>\n\nAfter a few years with Baltimore, Krause worked as a scout with the [[Phoenix Suns]], [[Philadelphia 76ers]], [[Los Angeles Lakers]] and [[Chicago Bulls]] in the 1970s before he left pro basketball to scout pro baseball instead. He was scouting for the [[Chicago White Sox]] when he received a call from new [[Chicago Bulls]] owner [[Jerry Reinsdorf]] to join the Bulls as their new General Manager and once again work in pro basketball.\n\n==Chicago Bulls==\nKrause succeeded [[Rod Thorn]] as [[Chicago Bulls]] GM in 1985, and managed the franchise as [[Michael Jordan]] and [[Phil Jackson]] ascended to elite status in their respective positions.\n\n===Drafting===\nJerry made a number of moves on being named GM that immediately began building the foundation for the team that would dominate the 1990s. He traded away undesirable players, turned over the Bulls roster and built up a collection of draft picks that would result in 2 significant additions to the team in 1987. Krause found two gems in the 1987 draft: [[Scottie Pippen]], a small forward from the [[University of Central Arkansas]]; and [[Horace Grant]], a power forward from [[Clemson University|Clemson]]. The two were, along with Jordan, cornerstones of the Bulls' 1991\u20131993 championship teams.<ref name=\"Halberstam, p. 200\">Halberstam, ''Playing for Keeps'', p. 200.</ref>  They were also culled from relative hoops obscurity; this went back to Krause's strength for finding players who were not well-received or even known by mainstream scouts.\n\nHowever, Krause also made many picks that did not help the team. In 1986, Krause planned on selecting a tall forward named [[Brad Sellers]] in the NBA Draft. Sellers, Krause reasoned, was too good a pick to pass up, as he handled the ball very well for a big man, and also had a solid outside jumper. Jordan, on the other hand, pushed management to take a two-way guard from [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]] named [[Johnny Dawkins]]. It looked as though Krause would take Dawkins even as late as the morning of the draft; the coaches and players had made it clear that they wanted him and not Sellers, and Krause did not particularly have a problem with Dawkins' game. The Bulls' head coach at the time, [[Doug Collins (basketball)|Doug Collins]], even told Duke coach [[Mike Krzyzewski]] the night before the draft that the team would pick Dawkins. However, Krause ignored everyone and picked Sellers anyway, and spent the summer trying to sell him to Jordan. Jordan went after Sellers mercilessly in practice, and Sellers was traded after three seasons. He played six total seasons in the NBA, averaging 6.3 points per game. Dawkins played for nine seasons in the NBA and averaged 11.1 points per game, though he did suffer from various injuries throughout his career.\n\nSellers was one of many Krause draft picks to underperform; others included [[Stacey King]], [[Mark Randall (basketball)|Mark Randall]], [[Will Perdue]] and [[Marcus Fizer]]. King and Perdue would serve as backup players on the Bulls' 1991\u20131993 Championship teams, but both players would later be traded away. During the 1993\u201394 NBA season, King was traded to the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]] in exchange for 7'2\" Australian-born center [[Luc Longley]].<ref name=\"longley\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/bulls/history/alltime_transactions.html|title=Chicago Bulls All-Time Transactions|work=www.nba.com|accessdate=August 28, 2009}}</ref> Longley's emergence for the Bulls during the 1994\u201395 season made Perdue expendable. Just before the start of the 1995\u201396 season, Perdue was traded to the [[San Antonio Spurs]] for [[Dennis Rodman]].\n\n===The Oakley trade===\nKrause made another transaction in 1988 to which Jordan strongly objected. It was clear that the Bulls needed a center if they were to contend for a title, so Krause dealt [[Charles Oakley]] to New York for [[Bill Cartwright]]. Oakley, who happened to be Jordan's best friend on the team,<ref name=\"Halberstam, p. 246\">Halberstam, ''Playing for Keeps'', p. 246.</ref> was extremely tough, particularly on the boards and on defense. When the Pistons came after Jordan with their physical players, Oakley was his bodyguard. Cartwright was a true center, unlike the power forward Oakley, but was much older. Although Cartwright did not have Oakley's reputation as a lockdown defender, he was very effective at preventing opposing centers from dominating games,<ref>Halberstam, ''Playing for Keeps'', p. 279-80.</ref> and was a more capable inside scorer. Jordan despised the trade, not only because of the players involved but also because of how they learned of it: via television, while he and Oakley were on their way to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] to see a [[Mike Tyson]] fight.<ref name=\"Halberstam, p. 200\"/> Cartwright turned out to be everything the Bulls needed, however, providing a presence in the middle for all three Bulls championships from 1991\u20131993. Perhaps most importantly, Cartwright proved to be the league's best center at defending [[Patrick Ewing]], the [[New York Knicks]]' star who was the key player on the Bulls' most important early-1990s conference rival.<ref name=\"Halberstam, p. 246\"/>\n\nOne of the most notable ways was demonstrated in the [[Basketball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Olympics]], when the [[1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team|Dream Team]], including Jordan and Pippen, took on [[Croatia national basketball team|Croatia]] for the gold medal. The Croatia team featured [[Toni Kuko\u010d]], a young star whom Krause had discovered through European contacts and was courting to a degree that some of the Bulls found annoying.<ref>Halberstam, ''Playing for Keeps'', p. 288-89.</ref> Jordan biographer [[David Halberstam]] said that Jordan and Pippen \"seemed to play against Kukoc as if they had a vendetta\", and that \"in the end, it was as if they had been playing not against Kukoc but against Krause.\"<ref name=\"Halberstam, p. 289\">Halberstam, ''Playing for Keeps'', p. 289.</ref> Jordan would later be quoted as saying: \"The trade of Oakley was good, and the best thing he did was to get Pippen and Grant. That's it. His claim to fame is that he drafted [[Earl Monroe]] for the Bullets. And I say to him, 'What pick was that?' He says, 'Two.' And I say, 'Hell! Earl Monroe was a real secret, huh? A real secret? If you hadn't taken him, he'd have gone third!'\"<ref>{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/multimedia/photo_gallery/0605/gallery.toxic/content.13.html | work=CNN | title=SI.com}}</ref>\n\nJordan later admitted that he may have been wrong and Krause may have been right about the trade for Cartwright,<ref>Halberstam, ''Playing for Keeps'', p. 247.</ref> but it changed nothing about Jordan's overall distrust and loathing for Krause. These feelings came to the surface in many different ways, including Jordan nicknaming Krause \"Crumbs\" in reference to his morbid obesity and slovenly appearance, as well as having doughnut residue on his clothes.<ref>[http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/rosenblog/ct-jerry-krause-deserved-better-rosenbloom-20170321-column.html]</ref>\n\n===Rebuilding after the first retirement of Jordan===\nThe first retirement of Jordan, following the 1993 NBA season, brought massive change to the Chicago Bulls roster. Krause attempted to replace Jordan with defensive specialist [[Pete Myers]] and free agent [[Ron Harper]], but neither proved capable of leading Chicago to a championship, although Harper would play an invaluable role in the second \"three-peat\". Just before Jordan announced his retirement, Krause was finally able to persuade Kuko\u010d to buy himself out of his European contract and join the Bulls.<ref name=\"Halberstam, p. 289\"/> The 1993\u201394 Bulls made it to the conference semi-finals, where they lost to the New York Knicks in seven games. The Bulls had beaten the Knicks in the playoffs the three previous years.\n\nWhen Jordan returned to the NBA at the end of the 1995 season, Krause once again went to work in assembling what has been labeled the best team in NBA history after offseason acquisition of [[Dennis Rodman]] from the Spurs. The Bulls won a then-NBA record 72 games and Krause was named [[NBA Executive of the Year Award|Executive of the Year]] for the second time. The next year, they achieved a then second best-ever NBA season with 69 wins and repeated as champions.\n\n===\"The Last Dance\"===\nKrause and head coach [[Phil Jackson]] had been friends for years, but their relationship was, in Jackson's opinion, shattered early in the 1990s after ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' reporter Sam Smith (whom Krause despised) published a book on the 1991 title team, ''[[The Jordan Rules (book)|The Jordan Rules]]''. The book detailed the tension that already existed between Krause and the players, and ultimately drove a wedge between Krause and Jackson.<ref>Halberstam, ''Playing for Keeps'', p. 311-15.</ref> Regardless of the success Jackson had as head coach of the Bulls, the tension between Jackson and Krause grew in the succeeding years, and by the 1997\u201398 season, was especially illustrated by the following incidents:\n\n*During the summer of 1997, Krause's stepdaughter got married. All of the Bulls assistant coaches and their wives were invited to the wedding, as was [[Tim Floyd]], then the head coach at [[Iowa State Cyclones men's basketball|Iowa State]], whom Krause was openly courting as Jackson's successor (and who would eventually succeed Jackson). Jackson and his then wife, June, were not even told of the wedding, much less invited, only finding out about the event when the wife of Cartwright, who by that time had become a Bulls assistant, asked June what she would be wearing to the reception.<ref>Halberstam, ''Playing for Keeps'', p. 249.</ref>\n*After contentious negotiations between Jackson and the Bulls in that same period, Jackson was signed for the 1997\u201398 season only. Krause announced the signing in what Chicago media widely considered to be a mean-spirited manner, emphasizing that Jackson would not be rehired even if the Bulls won the 1997\u201398 title. That triggered an argument between Jackson and Krause in which Jackson essentially told Krause that he seemed to be rooting for the other side and not the Bulls. At that point, Krause told Jackson, \"I don't care if it's 82-and-0 this year, you're fucking gone.\"<ref>Halberstam, ''Playing for Keeps'', p. 41. The \"82\" refers to the number of regular-season games each NBA team plays.</ref>\n*Krause publicly portrayed Jackson as a two-faced character who had very little regard for his assistant coaches, a perception that certain Krause associates in the Bulls organization had sought to spread about Jackson. At the height of the hard feelings in the spring of 1998, one of Krause's scouts went to press row in Chicago's [[United Center]] to explain to a reporter the insidious nature of Jackson's ego (excerpt from the Phil Jackson biography ''Mindgames'').\n*On the eve of the 1998 season, Krause said his most famous, and most misquoted, statement: \"Players and coaches don\u2019t win championships. Organizations do,\" which was often paraphrased to \u201cOrganizations win championships.\"  Years later in an interview with Adrian Wojnarowski of Yahoo! Sports, Krause clarified the statement, making \"the point was that the Bulls were more than one great player,\". The Bulls won championships four, five, and six \"not just because they had the best player but because they had the best second-best player and the best rebounder and the best sixth man and the best pure shooter and the best coach and, yes, the best general manager\". Krause said that the championships were also due to his team \"[having] the best marketers. The best trainers. The best salary cap guru,\" personnel who rarely got credit compared to players and coaches.<ref name=\"blogabull.com\">[https://www.blogabull.com/2017/3/24/15044772/the-true-story-of-jerry-krause-breakup-of-the-bulls-michael-jordan-phil-jackson-scottie-pippen]</ref>\n\nAfter the Bulls' final title of the [[Michael Jordan|Jordan]] era in 1998, Jackson left the team vowing never to coach again, but after he took a year off he decided to give it another chance with the Lakers. Longtime friend of Krause and Bulls assistant coach [[Tex Winter]], who was the architect of the triangle offense,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.hoopshype.com/blogs/lazenby/category/jerry-krause/ |title=Jerry Krause dies &#124; HoopsHype |publisher=Blogs.hoopshype.com |date= |accessdate=2017-03-22}}</ref> stayed with the Bulls for another full season, leaving the organization in the summer of 1999, when Phil Jackson was hired to coach the [[Los Angeles Lakers]]. Krause said that he had not spoken to Jackson since. When Jordan was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2009, Krause was not in attendance. Krause said he would not attend the ceremony because of his personal boycott of the Hall of Fame over their refusal to induct Winter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/nba/news/story?id=4464526|title=Krause passes on MJ's induction on principle|date=September 12, 2009|publisher=|accessdate=March 22, 2017}}</ref> Krause and Jackson briefly put their differences aside when Winter was finally inducted two years later. The two shook hands before the ceremony and conducted themselves in a cordial manner during Winter's segment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nba.nbcsports.com/2011/08/12/for-tex-winter-can-kraus-and-jackson-put-aside-feud/|title=For Tex Winter, Krause and Jackson put aside feud|first=Kurt|last=Helin|date=August 13, 2011|publisher=|accessdate=March 22, 2017}}</ref>\n\nKrause remarked when Jackson become President of the New York Knicks that \"Phil didn't take the job because he thought he had a playoff club. He took the job for the money\".<ref>[http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/19759358/nba-phil-jackson-biggest-failure-was-letting-game-pass-by]</ref>\n\n==Rebuilding==\nDeciding that the Bulls were aging and facing an uncertain future, Krause chose to unload the veterans and rebuild. Few major players were added though (other than from drafts).<ref name=\"blogabull.com\"/>\n\n===Younger talent===\nThe draft brought prolific collegiate players such as [[Elton Brand]], [[Ron Artest]], [[Marcus Fizer]], [[Jamal Crawford]], and [[Jay Williams (basketball)|Jay Williams]] to the Bulls but it would be the 2001 draft that stood out. After finishing 15\u201367 during the 2000\u20132001 season, Krause decided to gamble and trade away his best player in Brand for high schooler [[Tyson Chandler]] who was hyped as \"the next Kevin Garnett\", and draft another high schooler in [[Eddy Curry]] who, similarly, was hyped as a slightly smaller version of [[Shaquille O'Neal]], with the fourth overall pick in the draft.\n\nKrause believed that the tandem of Chandler and Curry would develop into elite players and provide the foundation for another dynasty. A mid-season trade the following year brought scorer [[Jalen Rose]] to the Bulls in exchange for [[Brad Miller (basketball player)|Brad Miller]] and Artest which cleared playing time for the two rookies. After drafting Jay Williams during the offseason, the Bulls had a roster with Rose, Crawford, Curry, Chandler, Williams, and Fizer that fulfilled Krause's dream of a talented young athletic team. The Bulls showed some improvement the following year.\n\n===Retirement and death===\nIn 2003, Krause retired as GM. The official explanation involved obesity-related health problems.<ref>{{Cite news| url =https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/08/sports/basketball-bulls-builder-krause-resigns-after-18-years.html |title=Bulls Builder Krause Resigns After 18 Years|author=Liz Robbins|work=[[The New York Times]] |date = April 8, 2003}}</ref> The Bulls fell to 23\u201359 in the next season, and Krause's dream of a talented young athletic team imploded with all of his acquisitions traded or out of the league within three years. Curry has had success in the league, but perhaps has not lived up to the lofty expectations that Krause had. Meanwhile, former players [[Elton Brand|Brand]], [[Brad Miller (basketball)|Miller]], [[Ron Artest|Artest]], and [[Tyson Chandler|Chandler]] became All-Stars for their new teams.\n\nKrause went back to his roots and worked briefly for the [[New York Yankees]] [[baseball]] team as a scout, before joining the [[New York Mets]] in 2005.<ref>Fred Mitchell. \"[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/831850991.html?dids=831850991:831850991&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=May+04%2C+2005&author=Fred+Mitchell%2C+Tribune+staff+reporter&pub=Chicago+Tribune&desc=Krause+prefers+silent+approach+to+scouting&pqatl=google Krause prefers silent approach to scouting]\".

The list deals exclusively with the areas within city administrative boundaries as opposed to [[List of urban areas in the European Union|urban areas]] or [[larger urban zone]]s (metropolitan areas), which are generally larger in terms of population than the main city.\n\nAs some cities have very narrow city limits and others very wide, the list may not give an accurate view of the comparative magnitude of different places, and the figures in the list should be treated with caution. [[Paris]] is the [[Paris metropolitan area|most populous urban area]] in the European Union, but the strict definition of the administrative limits of the City of Paris results in a far lower population shown in the table.\n\n==Cities by population within city limits==\nCities in bold are capital cities of their respective countries; ''[[Brussels]]'' is the capital of both [[Belgium]] and ''de facto'' the [[European Union]].\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" <!--style=\"width:100%;\"-->\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"| City !!

Urban renewal is the clearing out of blighted areas in inner cities to [[slum clearance|clear out slums]] and create opportunities for higher class housing, businesses, and more. A primary purpose of urban renewal is to restore economic viability to a given area by attracting external private and public investment and by encouraging business start-ups and survival.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the City|last=Caves|first=R. W.|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=978-0415862875|location=|pages=710}}</ref>\n\nModern attempts at renewal began in the late 19th century in developed nations, and experienced an intense phase in the late 1940s under the rubric of [[Reconstruction (architecture)|reconstruction]]. The process has had a major impact on many urban landscapes and has played an important role in the history and demographics of cities around the world.\n\nUrban renewal is a process where privately owned properties within a designated renewal area are purchased or taken by [[eminent domain]] by a municipal redevelopment authority, razed and then reconveyed to selected developers who devote them to other uses.\n\nThe concept of urban renewal as a method for social reform emerged in [[England]] as a reaction to the increasingly cramped and unsanitary conditions of the urban poor in the rapidly industrializing cities of the 19th century. The agenda that emerged was a progressive doctrine that assumed better housing conditions would reform its residents morally and economically. Another style of reform \u2013 imposed by the state for reasons of aesthetics and efficiency \u2013 could be said to have begun in 1853, with the recruitment of [[Baron Haussmann]] by [[Napoleon III]] for the redevelopment of Paris.\n\nThis process is also carried out in rural areas, referred to as village renewal, though it may not be exactly the same in practice.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Chigbu|first=Uchendu Eugene|title=Village renewal as an instrument of rural development: evidence from Weyarn, Germany|journal=Community Development|year=2012|volume=43|issue=2|pages=209\u2013224|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/rcod20/current|doi=10.1080/15575330.2011.575231}}</ref>\n\nIn some cases, renewal may result in [[urban sprawl]] when city infrastructure begins to include [[controlled-access highway|freeways and expressways]].<ref>Lobbia, J.A., [http://www.villagevoice.com/news/9911,lobbia,4486,5.html \"Bowery Bummer: Downtown Plan Will Make and Break History\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080323122746/http://www.villagevoice.com/news/9911%2Clobbia%2C4486%2C5.html |date=2008-03-23}}, The Village Voice, March 17, 1999</ref>\n\nUrban renewal has been seen by proponents as an economic engine and a reform mechanism, and by critics as a mechanism for control. Though it may bring more wealth to communities, it may also edge out its preexisting residents. Some redevelopment projects have been failures, including the [[Kelo v. City of New London|Kelo case]], in which the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the taking by a 5 to 4 vote, but where nothing was built on the taken property.\n\nMany cities link the revitalization of the central business district and [[gentrification]] of residential neighborhoods to earlier urban renewal programs. The goal of urban renewal evolved into a policy based less on destruction and more on renovation and investment, and today is an integral part of many local governments, often combined with [[small business|small]] and [[big business]] incentives.\n\nUntil 1970, the displaced owners and tenants received only the constitutionally-mandated \"just compensation\" specified in the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. This measure of compensation covered only the fair market value of the taken property, and omitted compensation for a variety of incidental losses like, for example, moving expenses, loss of favorable financing and notably, business losses, such as loss of business goodwill. In the 1970s the federal government and state governments enacted the Uniform Relocation Assistance Act which provides for limited compensation of some of these losses. However the Act denies the displaced land owners the right to sue to enforce its provisions, so it is deemed an act of legislative grace rather than a constitutional right. Historically, urban redevelopment has been controversial because of such practices as taking private property by eminent domain for \"public use\" and then turning it over to redevelopers free of charge or for less than the acquisition cost (known as \"land write-down\"). Thus, in the controversial Connecticut case of [[Kelo v. City of New London]] (2005) the plan called for a redeveloper to lease the subject 90-acre waterfront property for $1 per year.\n\n==By country==\n\n===Argentina===\n[[File:Puerto Madero - Buenos Aires.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Puerto Madero]], in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], is an urban renewal project, a transformation of a large disused [[dock (maritime)|dock]] into a new [[Luxury real estate|luxury]] residential and commercial [[district]].

Before the war, Singapore's housing environment had already been a problem. The tension of both infrastructure and housing conditions were worsened by the rapidly increasing number of the Singapore population in the 1930s. As a consequence of the war and the lack of economic development, between the 1940s to the 1950s, the previous evil of housing conditions continued to happen. As much as 240,000 squatters were placed in the Singapore during the 1950s. It was caused by the movement of migrants, especially from [[peninsular Malaysia]] and the baby boom.<ref name=\"Dale, O.J. 1999\">Dale, O.J., Urban Planning in Singapore: The Transformation of a City. 1999, New York: Oxford University Press.</ref> In mid 1959, overcrowded [[slums]] were inhabited by a big number of squatter populations, whereas these areas lacked the existence of service facilities such as sanitation.<ref>Lim, W.S.W., Cities for People: Reflections of a Southeast Asian Architect. 1990, Singapore: Select Books Pte Ltd.</ref>\n\nSince the establishment of the [[Republic of Singapore]], urban renewal has been included in the part of the national improvement policy that was urgently put in action. Before that, the 1958 master plan had already been designed to solve the city problems. However, due to the lack of [[urban planning]] experts caused by the deficiency of professional staff, criticism came from many urban practitioners. The professional team recommended by the United Nations then was asked by the government to cope with the urban renewal matters and its redevelopment plan in 1961. Based on the UN assistance report, two pilot developments were initiated in the end of 1964 by the government. These redevelopments then led to the success of Singapore's urban renewal because the government could provide sufficient amount of public housing and business areas.<ref name=\"Dale, O.J. 1999\"/>\n\nThe most recent project is Paya Lebar Quarter.

The obstacles came from the resistance of people who used to live in the slums and squatters. It was reported by Singapore newspapers that those people were reluctant to be replaced. This became the major problems of 1960s redevelopment schemes.<ref>Bishop, R., J. Phillips, and W.-W. Yeo, eds. Beyond Description: Singapore Space Historicity. 2004, Routledge: New York.</ref> Affordable land value also became one of its reasons. Another problem was that the government had to purchase the private land owned by the middle and upper society to make the land vacant and be used for redevelopment.<ref name=\"Dale, O.J. 1999\"/>\n\n===South Korea===\n{{main|Urban regeneration in South Korea}}\n\n===United Kingdom===\n[[File:Booth map of Westminster.jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|right|Part of [[Charles Booth (philanthropist)|Charles Booth]]'s colour-coded [[poverty map]], showing [[Westminster]] in 1889 \u2013 a pioneering social study of poverty that shocked the population.]]\nFrom the 1850s onwards, the terrible conditions of the urban poor in the [[slum]]s of [[London]] began to attract the attention of [[social reform]]ers and philanthropists, who began a movement for social housing. The first area to be targeted was the notorious slum called the [[Devil's Acre]] near [[Westminster]].

The Rochester Buildings were sold to the Peabody Trust in 1877 and later become known as Blocks A to D of the Old Perkin's Rents Estate. [[Angela Burdett-Coutts, 1st Baroness Burdett-Coutts]] funded an experimental social housing estate, among the first of its kind, on the corner of Columbia Road and Old Pye Street (now demolished).<ref name=gov/> In 1869 the [[Peabody Trust]] built one of its first housing estates at Brewer's Green, between Victoria Street and [[St. James's Park]].

Like many of the social housing estates, the Abbey Orchard Estate was built following the square plan concept. Blocks of flats were built around a courtyard, creating a semi-private space within the estate functioning as recreation area. The courtyards were meant to create a community atmosphere and the blocks of flats were designed to allow sunlight into the courtyards. The blocks of flats were built using high-quality brickwork and included architectural features such as [[lettering]], [[glazing (window)|glazing]], fixtures and fittings. The estates built in the area at the time were considered model dwellings and included shared laundry and sanitary facilities, innovative at the time, and fireplaces in some bedrooms. The design was subsequently repeated in numerous other housing estates in London.<ref name=gov/>\n\nState intervention was first achieved with the passage of the [[Public Health Act 1875|Public Health Act of 1875]] through [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]]. The Act focused on combating filthy urban living conditions that were the cause of disease outbreaks. It required all new residential construction to include running water and an internal drainage system and also prohibited the construction of shoddy housing by building contractors.\n\n[[File:Cellar dwelling nichol street 1863.jpg|thumb|right|\"A Cellar dwelling in Nichol Street\", illustration for \"More Revelations of Bethnal Green\", published in ''The Builder'', vol.

The slum clearance began in 1891 and included 730 houses inhabited by 5,719 people. The LCC architects designed 21 and [[Rowland Plumbe]] two of 23 blocks containing between 10 and 85 tenements each. A total of 1,069 tenements, mostly two or three-roomed, were planned to accommodate 5,524 persons.

[[Christopher Addison]], the Minister for Housing at the time was responsible for the drafting of the [[Housing, Town Planning, &c. Act 1919]] which introduced the new concept of the state being involved in the building of new houses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/worldwarone/hq/outcomes1_02.shtml|title=Outcomes of the War: Britain}}</ref> This marked the start of a long 20th century tradition of state-owned housing, which would much later evolve into [[council estate]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=46467|title=Housing the Heroes and Fighting the Slums: The Inter-war Years|accessdate=2012-12-17}}</ref>\n\nWith the onset of the [[Great Depression]] in 1929, increased house building and government expenditure was used to pull the country out of recession. The Housing Act of 1930 gave local councils wide-ranging powers to demolish properties unfit for human habitation or that posed a danger to health, and obligated them to rehouse those people who were relocated due to the large scale slum clearance programs. Cities with a large proportion of Victorian terraced housing \u2013 housing that was no longer deemed of sufficient standard for modern living requirements \u2013 underwent the greatest changes. Over 5,000 homes (25,000 residents) in the city of [[Bristol]] were designated as redevelopment areas in 1933 and slated for demolition. Although efforts were made to house the victims of the demolitions in the same area as before, in practice this was too difficult to fully implement and many people were rehoused in other areas, even different cities. In an effort to rehouse the poorest people affected by redevelopment, the rent for housing was set at an artificially low level, although this policy also only achieved mixed success.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fet.uwe.ac.uk/conweb/house_ages/council_housing/section4.htm|title=Inter-war Slum Clearance|accessdate=2012-12-17}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Josefov (Prague)|Josefov neighborhood, or Old Jewish Quarter]], in Prague was leveled and rebuilt in an effort at urban renewal between 1890 and 1913.\n\nOther programs, such as that in [[Castleford]] in the United Kingdom and known as The Castleford Project<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/castleford|title=Kevin McCloud and the Big Town Plan \u2013 All 4|publisher=|accessdate=2 October 2016}}</ref> seek to establish a process of urban renewal which enables local citizens to have greater control and ownership of the direction of their community and the way in which it overcomes market failure. This supports important themes in urban renewal today, such as participation, [[sustainability]] and trust \u2013 and government acting as advocate and 'enabler', rather than an instrument of command and control.\n\nDuring the 1990s the concept of [[culture]]-led regeneration gained ground. Examples most often cited as successes include [[Temple Bar, Dublin|Temple Bar]] in [[Dublin]] where tourism was attracted to a bohemian 'cultural quarter', [[Barcelona]] where the 1992 Olympics provided a catalyst for infrastructure improvements and the redevelopment of the water front area, and [[Bilbao]] where the building of a new art museum was the focus for a new business district around the city's derelict dock area. The approach has become very popular in the UK due to the availability of lottery funding for capital projects and the vibrancy of the cultural and creative sectors. However, the arrival of [[Tate Modern]] in the [[London]] borough of [[Southwark]] may be heralded as a catalyst to economic revival in its surrounding neighborhood.\n\nIn post-apartheid [[South Africa]] major grassroots social movements such as the [[Western Cape Anti-Eviction Campaign]] and [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]] emerged to contest 'urban renewal' programs that forcibly relocated the poor out of the cities.\n\nThe politics of urban renewal which frequently relies on the state's dominance in the discourse of removing the character and infrastructure of older city cores, with that which is required by existing market based constituents has to be examined further. Professor Kenneth Paul Tan of the National University of Singapore has this to say \"Singapore's self-image of having achieved success against all odds puts tremendous pressure on its government and people to maintain and exceed this success. The push for progress and development destroys many things in its path, often indiscriminately, sometimes unwittingly. To cope psychically with such losses, Singapore's culture of comfort and affluence has been attained through the self-mastery of repressive techniques. Desiring economic progress, upward mobility, affluent and convenient lifestyles and a \u2018world-class\u2019 city.\"\n\n\"Singaporeans have had to repress the loss of their sense of place and community, family ties, passion and compassion, Asian customs and values, openness to the rest of the world and even the discipline, hard work and thrift associated with earlier capitalist\u2013industrial attitudes. But no repressive efforts can be complete, consistent and fully successful, even in dominant hegemony.

It has not been long time that this meaning has changed, or has begun to change, towards the Anglo-Saxo model taking in account the idea of an action that \"determines an increase of economic, cultural, social values in an existing urban or territorial context.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mantini|date=2013|title=Manuale di diritto urbanistico|url=|journal=Giuffr\u00e8 Editore|volume=|issue=|pages=|doi=|issn=|via=}}</ref>\n\nFor instance, we can mention the regional law of 29 July 2008, nr. 21, of the [[Apulia|Puglia]] Region, \"Norms for urban regeneration\", which states: \u00abBy this law, the Puglia Region promotes the regeneration of parts of cities and urban systems in coherence with municipal and inter-municipal strategies in order to improve urban, socio-economics, environmental and cultural conditions of human settlements \"[http://www.regione.puglia.it/documents/10192/5155767/LEGGE+REGIONALE++29+luglio+2008,%20n.+21+(id+5155780)/afb5c62f-6b66-471a-ba11-50fa809ddaab?version=1.0 LEGGE REGIONALE 29 luglio 2008, n. 21: \"Norme per la rigenerazione urbana\"].\n\nA similar concept was carried out by [[Lombardy]] Region by mean of its Regional Law of 26 November 2019 - n. 18 \"Simplification and incentive measures for urban and territorial regeneration, as well as for the recovery of existing building heritage.

Moreover, these rewards are also reserved for those who carry on some particular implementation models. For instance,  you can increase the volume of your building whenever \"integrated safety systems and construction site risk management processes are applied; methods that are based on traceability and control activities, with particular reference to soil movement and waste traceability, based on advanced technologies\", the increase in the building index is recognized in the art. 3 and these rewards are also given when technologies as geolocation, video surveillance and perimeter protection are implemented in order to prevent the \"risk of crime during all phases of construction sites\" [https://unitedrisk.eu/la-legalita-per-la-rigenerazione-urbana/ La legalit\u00e0 per la rigenerazione urbana: a law analysis].\n\n===United States===\n[[File:Fairbanks, Alaska aerial, downtown urban renewal zone, early 1960s.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of downtown [[Fairbanks, Alaska]] in the early 1960s, showing the area cleared in [[Alaska]]'s first urban renewal project.]]\nLarge scale urban renewal projects in the US started in the [[interwar period]] as an attempt to clear out blight inner cities. Prototype urban renewal projects include the design and construction of [[Central Park]] in New York and the 1909 Plan for Chicago by [[Daniel Burnham]]. Similarly, the efforts of [[Jacob Riis]] in advocating for the demolition of degraded areas of New York in the late 19th century was also formative. The redevelopment of large sections of [[New York City]] and [[New York State]] by [[Robert Moses]] between the 1930s and the 1970s was a notable and prominent example of urban redevelopment. Moses directed the construction of new [[bridge]]s, [[highway]]s, [[Public Housing in the United States|housing project]]s, and [[park|public parks]].\n\nOther cities across the USA began to create redevelopment programs in the late 1930s and 1940s. These early projects were generally focused on [[slum clearance]] and were implemented by local [[public housing authorities]], which were responsible both for clearing slums and for building new affordable housing. The [[City Planning and Housing Council]] (CHPC) founded in 1937 had a large hand in the reconstruction of urban slums, with their primary mission being the elimination of poor housing conditions, creating less crowded and cleaner public housing.<ref name=\"Sugrue\">{{Cite book|title=The Origins of the Urban Crisis: Race and Inequality in Postwar Detroit|last=Sugrue|first=Thomas J.|date=2014-01-31|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9781400851218|location=Princeton|doi = 10.1515/9781400851218}}</ref>\n\nIn 1944, the [[GI Bill]] (officially the Serviceman's Readjustment Act) guaranteed [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Administration]] (VA) mortgages to veterans under favorable terms, which fueled suburbanization after the end of [[World War II]], as places like [[Levittown, New York]], [[Warren, Michigan]] and the [[San Fernando Valley]] of [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] were transformed from farmland into cities occupied by tens of thousands of families in a few years. However, the GI Bill was primarily beneficial for white veterans over black ones, so in inner cities where black veterans tried using the benefits from the GI bill to occur housing and/or jobs, it was much more difficult.<ref name=\"Sugrue\"/>\n\nThe [[Housing Act of 1949]], also known as the Taft-Ellender-Wagner Act, provided federal loans to cities to acquire and clear slum areas to be sold to private developers to redevelop in accordance with a plan prepared by the city (normally with new housing), and grants to cover two-thirds of the portion of the city's costs in excess of the sale prices received from the developers, as well as provide millions of dollars to create public housing throughout the country.<ref name=\"Sugrue\"/> The phrase used at the time was \"urban redevelopment\". \"Urban renewal\" was a phrase popularized with the passage of the [[Housing Act of 1954]], which made these projects more enticing to developers by, among other things, providing mortgages backed by the [[Federal Housing Administration]] (FHA).\n\nThe term \"urban renewal\" was not introduced in the USA until the Housing Act was again amended in 1954. That was also the year in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] upheld the general validity of urban redevelopment statutes in the landmark case, ''[[Berman v.

Pittsburgh was infamous around the world as one of the dirtiest and most economically depressed cities, and seemed ripe for urban renewal. A large section of downtown at the heart of the city was demolished, converted to parks, office buildings, and a sports arena and renamed the [[Central Business District (Pittsburgh)|Golden Triangle]] in what was universally recognized as a major success.{{By whom|date=July 2012}} Other neighborhoods were also subjected to urban renewal, but with mixed results.

The efforts of the CHPC and the FHA to renew Detroit caused huge amounts of black displacement due to the construction of highways and airports directly through black neighborhoods like [[8 Mile City|8-mile]] and [[Paradise Valley, Detroit|Paradise Valley]]. Black families were thrown out from their homes and not provided relocation services. The \"slums\" being cleared or being looked at for redevelopment were primarily black neighborhoods.<ref name=\"Sugrue\"/>\n\nIn 1956, the [[Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956|Federal-Aid Highway Act]] gave state and federal government complete control over new highways, and often they were routed directly through vibrant urban neighborhoods\u2014isolating or destroying many\u2014since the focus of the program was to bring traffic in and out of the central cores of cities as expeditiously as possible and nine out of every ten dollars spent came from the federal government. This resulted in a serious degradation of the [[tax base]]s of many cities, isolated entire neighborhoods,<ref>\"Race, Place, and Opportunity,\" The American Prospect, September 22, 2008. http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=race_place_and_opportunity</ref> and meant that existing commercial districts were bypassed by the majority of [[commuter]]s.<ref>\"Interstate Highways,\" The Economist, June 22, 2006. http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_SDRSQVR</ref>  Segregation continued to increase as communities were displaced.

This came to be seen as a tragedy by many residents and [[urban planner]]s, and one of the centerpieces of the redevelopment\u2014[[Government Center, Boston, Massachusetts|Government Center]]\u2014is still considered an example of the excesses of urban renewal.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n====Reaction====\nIn 1961, [[Jane Jacobs]] published ''[[The Death and Life of Great American Cities]]'', one of the first\u2014and strongest\u2014critiques of contemporary large-scale urban renewal. However, it would still be a few years before organized movements began to oppose urban renewal. The [[Rondout, New York|Rondout]] neighborhood in Kingston, New York (on the Hudson River) was essentially destroyed by a federally funded urban renewal program in the 1960s, with more than 400 old buildings demolished, most of them historic brick structures built in the 19th century. Similarly ill-conceived urban renewal programs gutted the historic centers of other towns and cities across America in the 1950s and 1960s (for example the [[West End, Boston|West End]] neighborhood in Boston, the downtown area of [[Norfolk, Virginia]] and the historic waterfront areas of the towns of [[Narragansett, Rhode Island|Narragansett]] and [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]] in Rhode Island).\n\nBy the 1970s many major cities developed opposition to the sweeping urban-renewal plans for their cities. In [[Boston]], community activists halted construction of the proposed [[Southwest Corridor (Boston)|Southwest Expressway]] but only after a three-mile long stretch of land had been cleared. In [[San Francisco]], [[Joseph Alioto]] was the first mayor to publicly repudiate the policy of urban renewal, and with the backing of community groups, forced the state to end construction of highways through the heart of the city. [[Atlanta]] lost over 60,000 people between 1960 and 1970 because of urban renewal and expressway construction,<ref>\"Lewyn, Michael.  How City Hall Causes Sprawl,\" p. 3, ECOLOGY LAW QUARTERLY, VOL. 30, NO. 189, 2003.  http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=816864</ref> but a downtown building boom turned the city into the showcase of the [[New South]] in the 1970s and 1980s. In the early 1970s in [[Toronto]] Jacobs was heavily involved in a group which halted the construction of the [[Spadina Expressway]] and altered transport policy in that city.\n\nSome of the policies around urban renewal began to change under President [[Lyndon Johnson]] and the [[War on Poverty]], and in 1968, the [[Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968|Housing and Urban Development Act]] and The New Communities Act of 1968 guaranteed private financing for private entrepreneurs to plan and develop new communities. Subsequently, the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 established the [[Community Development Block Grant]] program (CDBG) which began in earnest the focus on redevelopment of existing neighborhoods and properties, rather than demolition of substandard housing and economically depressed areas.\n\nCurrently, a mix of renovation, selective demolition, commercial development, and tax incentives is most often used to revitalize urban neighborhoods. An example of an entire eradication of a community is [[Africville]] in [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]]. [[Gentrification]] is still controversial, and often results in familiar patterns of poorer residents being priced out of urban areas into suburbs or more depressed areas of cities. Some programs, such as that administered by [[Fresh Ministries]] and Operation New Hope in [[Jacksonville, Florida]], and the Hill Community Development Corporation (Hill CDC) in Pittsburgh's historic [[Hill District (Pittsburgh)|Hill District]] attempt to develop communities, while at the same time combining highly favorable loan programs with financial literacy education so that poorer residents are not displaced.\n\nAn example of urban renewal gone wrong in the United States is in downtown [[Niagara Falls, New York]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Most of the original downtown was demolished in the 1960s, and many replacement projects including the [[Rainbow Centre Factory Outlet]], [[Niagara Falls Convention and Civic Center]], the Native American Cultural Center, the Hooker Chemical (later the [[Occidental Petroleum]]) Headquarters building, the Wintergarden, the [[Fallsville Splash Park]], a large parking ramp, an enclosed pedestrian walkway, the Falls Street Faire & Falls Street Station entertainment complexes, sections of the [[Robert Moses State Parkway]], and the Mayor E. Dent Lackey Plaza closed within twenty to thirty years of their construction. In several American cities, some demolished blocks were never replaced.\n\nUltimately, the former tourist district of the city along Falls Street was destroyed. It went against the principles of several urban philosophers, such as [[Jane Jacobs]], who claimed that mixed-use districts were needed (which the new downtown was not) and arteries needed to be kept open. Smaller buildings also should be built or kept. In Niagara Falls, however, the convention center blocked traffic into the city, located in the center of Falls Street (the main artery), and the Wintergarden also blocked traffic from the convention center to the [[Niagara Falls]]. The Rainbow Centre interrupted the street grid, taking up three blocks, and parking ramps isolated the city from the core, leading to the degradation of nearby neighborhoods. Tourists were forced to walk around the Rainbow Center, the Wintergarden, and the Quality Inn (all of which were adjacent), in total five blocks, discouraging small business in the city.\n\n==Pros and cons==\nUrban renewal sometimes lives up to the hopes of its original proponents \u2013 it has been assessed by politicians, [[urban planner]]s, civic leaders, and residents \u2013 it has played an undeniably{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} important if controversial role. But at other times urban redevelopment projects have failed in several American cities, having wasted large amounts of public funds to no purpose.\n\nReplenished housing stock might be an improvement in quality; it may increase density and reduce [[urban sprawl|sprawl]]; it might have economic benefits and improve the global economic competitiveness of a city's centre. It may, in some instances, improve cultural and social amenity, and it may also improve opportunities for safety and surveillance. Developments such as London Docklands increased tax revenues for government. In late 1964, the British commentator Neil Wates expressed the opinion that urban renewal in the United States had 'demonstrated the tremendous advantages which flow from an urban renewal programme,' such as remedying the 'personal problems' of the poor, creation or renovation of housing stock, educational and cultural 'opportunities'.<ref>Neil Wates, 'Urban renewal: US and UK' New Society 31 December 1964, p. 15</ref> In the United States successful urban redevelopment projects tend to revitalize downtown areas, but have not been successful in revitalizing cities as a whole. The process has often resulted in the displacement of low-income city inhabitants when their dwellings were taken and demolished. Eventually, urban redevelopment became an engine of construction of shopping malls, automobile factories and dealerships, \"large box\" department stores (like Target, Costco and Best Buy). Thus, in Washington, DC, the famous (or notorious) Southwest Washington renewal project (see [[Berman v. Parker]]) displaced thousands of largely African-American families, but provided them with no replacement housing because at the time (1954) the law did not provide for any. Also, the version of the project that was approved by the U.S. Supreme Court in Berman, provided for low-cost replacement housing, one-third of which was to rent for $17/room/month, but after the court's decision, that provision in the local law was repealed.\n\nReplacement housing \u2013 particularly in the form of high-rise housing for low-income tenants \u2013 has not been successful. These projects are difficult to police, leading to an increase in crime, and such structures might in themselves be dehumanizing. Public housing projects like [[Cabrini-Green]] in [[Chicago]] and [[Pruitt-Igoe]] in [[St. Louis]] became so bad that they had to be demolished.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=15em}}\n* [[Adaptive reuse]]\n* [[Big City Plan]]\n* [[Community development]]\n* [[Cost overrun]]\n* [[Environmental racism]]\n* [[Gentrification]]\n* [[Housing Market Renewal Initiative]]\n* [[List of planned cities]]\n* [[List of urban planners]]\n* [[Megaproject]]\n* [[New town]]\n* [[New Urbanism]]\n* [[Overspill estate]]\n* [[Phase I environmental site assessment]]\n* [[Principles of Intelligent Urbanism]]\n* [[Slum upgrading]]\n* [[Temporary use]]\n* [[Urban decay]]\n* [[Urban economics]]\n* [[Urban renaissance]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Klemek, Christopher (2011).

Urban renewal is the clearing out of blighted areas in inner cities to [[slum clearance|clear out slums]] and create opportunities for higher class housing, businesses, and more. A primary purpose of urban renewal is to restore economic viability to a given area by attracting external private and public investment and by encouraging business start-ups and survival.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the City|last=Caves|first=R. W.|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=978-0415862875|location=|pages=710}}</ref>\n\nModern attempts at renewal began in the late 19th century in developed nations, and experienced an intense phase in the late 1940s under the rubric of [[Reconstruction (architecture)|reconstruction]]. The process has had a major impact on many urban landscapes and has played an important role in the history and demographics of cities around the world.\n\nUrban renewal is a process where privately owned properties within a designated renewal area are purchased or taken by [[eminent domain]] by a municipal redevelopment authority, razed and then reconveyed to selected developers who devote them to other uses.\n\nThe concept of urban renewal as a method for social reform emerged in [[England]] as a reaction to the increasingly cramped and unsanitary conditions of the urban poor in the rapidly industrializing cities of the 19th century. The agenda that emerged was a progressive doctrine that assumed better housing conditions would reform its residents morally and economically. Another style of reform \u2013 imposed by the state for reasons of aesthetics and efficiency \u2013 could be said to have begun in 1853, with the recruitment of [[Baron Haussmann]] by [[Napoleon III]] for the redevelopment of Paris.\n\nThis process is also carried out in rural areas, referred to as village renewal, though it may not be exactly the same in practice.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Chigbu|first=Uchendu Eugene|title=Village renewal as an instrument of rural development: evidence from Weyarn, Germany|journal=Community Development|year=2012|volume=43|issue=2|pages=209\u2013224|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/rcod20/current|doi=10.1080/15575330.2011.575231}}</ref>\n\nIn some cases, renewal may result in [[urban sprawl]] when city infrastructure begins to include [[controlled-access highway|freeways and expressways]].<ref>Lobbia, J.A., [http://www.villagevoice.com/news/9911,lobbia,4486,5.html \"Bowery Bummer: Downtown Plan Will Make and Break History\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080323122746/http://www.villagevoice.com/news/9911%2Clobbia%2C4486%2C5.html |date=2008-03-23}}, The Village Voice, March 17, 1999</ref>\n\nUrban renewal has been seen by proponents as an economic engine and a reform mechanism, and by critics as a mechanism for control. Though it may bring more wealth to communities, it may also edge out its preexisting residents. Some redevelopment projects have been failures, including the [[Kelo v. City of New London|Kelo case]], in which the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the taking by a 5 to 4 vote, but where nothing was built on the taken property.\n\nMany cities link the revitalization of the central business district and [[gentrification]] of residential neighborhoods to earlier urban renewal programs. The goal of urban renewal evolved into a policy based less on destruction and more on renovation and investment, and today is an integral part of many local governments, often combined with [[small business|small]] and [[big business]] incentives.\n\nUntil 1970, the displaced owners and tenants received only the constitutionally-mandated \"just compensation\" specified in the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. This measure of compensation covered only the fair market value of the taken property, and omitted compensation for a variety of incidental losses like, for example, moving expenses, loss of favorable financing and notably, business losses, such as loss of business goodwill. In the 1970s the federal government and state governments enacted the Uniform Relocation Assistance Act which provides for limited compensation of some of these losses. However the Act denies the displaced land owners the right to sue to enforce its provisions, so it is deemed an act of legislative grace rather than a constitutional right. Historically, urban redevelopment has been controversial because of such practices as taking private property by eminent domain for \"public use\" and then turning it over to redevelopers free of charge or for less than the acquisition cost (known as \"land write-down\"). Thus, in the controversial Connecticut case of [[Kelo v. City of New London]] (2005) the plan called for a redeveloper to lease the subject 90-acre waterfront property for $1 per year.\n\n==By country==\n\n===Argentina===\n[[File:Puerto Madero - Buenos Aires.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Puerto Madero]], in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], is an urban renewal project, a transformation of a large disused [[dock (maritime)|dock]] into a new [[Luxury real estate|luxury]] residential and commercial [[district]].

Before the war, Singapore's housing environment had already been a problem. The tension of both infrastructure and housing conditions were worsened by the rapidly increasing number of the Singapore population in the 1930s. As a consequence of the war and the lack of economic development, between the 1940s to the 1950s, the previous evil of housing conditions continued to happen. As much as 240,000 squatters were placed in the Singapore during the 1950s. It was caused by the movement of migrants, especially from [[peninsular Malaysia]] and the baby boom.<ref name=\"Dale, O.J. 1999\">Dale, O.J., Urban Planning in Singapore: The Transformation of a City. 1999, New York: Oxford University Press.</ref> In mid 1959, overcrowded [[slums]] were inhabited by a big number of squatter populations, whereas these areas lacked the existence of service facilities such as sanitation.<ref>Lim, W.S.W., Cities for People: Reflections of a Southeast Asian Architect. 1990, Singapore: Select Books Pte Ltd.</ref>\n\nSince the establishment of the [[Republic of Singapore]], urban renewal has been included in the part of the national improvement policy that was urgently put in action. Before that, the 1958 master plan had already been designed to solve the city problems. However, due to the lack of [[urban planning]] experts caused by the deficiency of professional staff, criticism came from many urban practitioners. The professional team recommended by the United Nations then was asked by the government to cope with the urban renewal matters and its redevelopment plan in 1961. Based on the UN assistance report, two pilot developments were initiated in the end of 1964 by the government. These redevelopments then led to the success of Singapore's urban renewal because the government could provide sufficient amount of public housing and business areas.<ref name=\"Dale, O.J. 1999\"/>\n\nThe most recent project is Paya Lebar Quarter.

The obstacles came from the resistance of people who used to live in the slums and squatters. It was reported by Singapore newspapers that those people were reluctant to be replaced. This became the major problems of 1960s redevelopment schemes.<ref>Bishop, R., J. Phillips, and W.-W. Yeo, eds.

The first area to be targeted was the notorious slum called the [[Devil's Acre]] near [[Westminster]].

Like many of the social housing estates, the Abbey Orchard Estate was built following the square plan concept. Blocks of flats were built around a courtyard, creating a semi-private space within the estate functioning as recreation area. The courtyards were meant to create a community atmosphere and the blocks of flats were designed to allow sunlight into the courtyards. The blocks of flats were built using high-quality brickwork and included architectural features such as [[lettering]], [[glazing (window)|glazing]], fixtures and fittings. The estates built in the area at the time were considered model dwellings and included shared laundry and sanitary facilities, innovative at the time, and fireplaces in some bedrooms. The design was subsequently repeated in numerous other housing estates in London.<ref name=gov/>\n\nState intervention was first achieved with the passage of the [[Public Health Act 1875|Public Health Act of 1875]] through [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]]. The Act focused on combating filthy urban living conditions that were the cause of disease outbreaks. It required all new residential construction to include running water and an internal drainage system and also prohibited the construction of shoddy housing by building contractors.\n\n[[File:Cellar dwelling nichol street 1863.jpg|thumb|right|\"A Cellar dwelling in Nichol Street\", illustration for \"More Revelations of Bethnal Green\", published in ''The Builder'', vol.

[[Christopher Addison]], the Minister for Housing at the time was responsible for the drafting of the [[Housing, Town Planning, &c. Act 1919]] which introduced the new concept of the state being involved in the building of new houses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/worldwarone/hq/outcomes1_02.shtml|title=Outcomes of the War: Britain}}</ref> This marked the start of a long 20th century tradition of state-owned housing, which would much later evolve into [[council estate]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=46467|title=Housing the Heroes and Fighting the Slums: The Inter-war Years|accessdate=2012-12-17}}</ref>\n\nWith the onset of the [[Great Depression]] in 1929, increased house building and government expenditure was used to pull the country out of recession. The Housing Act of 1930 gave local councils wide-ranging powers to demolish properties unfit for human habitation or that posed a danger to health, and obligated them to rehouse those people who were relocated due to the large scale slum clearance programs. Cities with a large proportion of Victorian terraced housing \u2013 housing that was no longer deemed of sufficient standard for modern living requirements \u2013 underwent the greatest changes. Over 5,000 homes (25,000 residents) in the city of [[Bristol]] were designated as redevelopment areas in 1933 and slated for demolition. Although efforts were made to house the victims of the demolitions in the same area as before, in practice this was too difficult to fully implement and many people were rehoused in other areas, even different cities. In an effort to rehouse the poorest people affected by redevelopment, the rent for housing was set at an artificially low level, although this policy also only achieved mixed success.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fet.uwe.ac.uk/conweb/house_ages/council_housing/section4.htm|title=Inter-war Slum Clearance|accessdate=2012-12-17}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Josefov (Prague)|Josefov neighborhood, or Old Jewish Quarter]], in Prague was leveled and rebuilt in an effort at urban renewal between 1890 and 1913.\n\nOther programs, such as that in [[Castleford]] in the United Kingdom and known as The Castleford Project<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/castleford|title=Kevin McCloud and the Big Town Plan \u2013 All 4|publisher=|accessdate=2 October 2016}}</ref> seek to establish a process of urban renewal which enables local citizens to have greater control and ownership of the direction of their community and the way in which it overcomes market failure. This supports important themes in urban renewal today, such as participation, [[sustainability]] and trust \u2013 and government acting as advocate and 'enabler', rather than an instrument of command and control.\n\nDuring the 1990s the concept of [[culture]]-led regeneration gained ground. Examples most often cited as successes include [[Temple Bar, Dublin|Temple Bar]] in [[Dublin]] where tourism was attracted to a bohemian 'cultural quarter', [[Barcelona]] where the 1992 Olympics provided a catalyst for infrastructure improvements and the redevelopment of the water front area, and [[Bilbao]] where the building of a new art museum was the focus for a new business district around the city's derelict dock area. The approach has become very popular in the UK due to the availability of lottery funding for capital projects and the vibrancy of the cultural and creative sectors. However, the arrival of [[Tate Modern]] in the [[London]] borough of [[Southwark]] may be heralded as a catalyst to economic revival in its surrounding neighborhood.\n\nIn post-apartheid [[South Africa]] major grassroots social movements such as the [[Western Cape Anti-Eviction Campaign]] and [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]] emerged to contest 'urban renewal' programs that forcibly relocated the poor out of the cities.\n\nThe politics of urban renewal which frequently relies on the state's dominance in the discourse of removing the character and infrastructure of older city cores, with that which is required by existing market based constituents has to be examined further. Professor Kenneth Paul Tan of the National University of Singapore has this to say \"Singapore's self-image of having achieved success against all odds puts tremendous pressure on its government and people to maintain and exceed this success. The push for progress and development destroys many things in its path, often indiscriminately, sometimes unwittingly. To cope psychically with such losses, Singapore's culture of comfort and affluence has been attained through the self-mastery of repressive techniques. Desiring economic progress, upward mobility, affluent and convenient lifestyles and a \u2018world-class\u2019 city.\"\n\n\"Singaporeans have had to repress the loss of their sense of place and community, family ties, passion and compassion, Asian customs and values, openness to the rest of the world and even the discipline, hard work and thrift associated with earlier capitalist\u2013industrial attitudes. But no repressive efforts can be complete, consistent and fully successful, even in dominant hegemony. Therefore, the \u2018now\u2019 is always a complex and fractured world of disjunctive values, attitudes and ideals. The supernatural intrusions featured in these five films should tell us something about the impossibility of a coherent world of ideology and experience.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tan|first1=Kenneth Paul|title=Violence and the supernatural in Singapore cinema|journal=New Cinemas: Journal of Contemporary Film|date=1 January 2011|volume=8|issue=3|pages=213\u2013223|doi=10.1386/ncin.8.3.213_1}}</ref>\n\n===Italy===\nIn Italy, the concept of urban renewal had been having the classical meaning of \"recovery\", \"re-use\", and also \"redevelopment\" for many years. It has not been long time that this meaning has changed, or has begun to change, towards the Anglo-Saxo model taking in account the idea of an action that \"determines an increase of economic, cultural, social values in an existing urban or territorial context.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mantini|date=2013|title=Manuale di diritto urbanistico|url=|journal=Giuffr\u00e8 Editore|volume=|issue=|pages=|doi=|issn=|via=}}</ref>\n\nFor instance, we can mention the regional law of 29 July 2008, nr. 21, of the [[Apulia|Puglia]] Region, \"Norms for urban regeneration\", which states: \u00abBy this law, the Puglia Region promotes the regeneration of parts of cities and urban systems in coherence with municipal and inter-municipal strategies in order to improve urban, socio-economics, environmental and cultural conditions of human settlements \"[http://www.regione.puglia.it/documents/10192/5155767/LEGGE+REGIONALE++29+luglio+2008,%20n.+21+(id+5155780)/afb5c62f-6b66-471a-ba11-50fa809ddaab?version=1.0 LEGGE REGIONALE 29 luglio 2008, n. 21: \"Norme per la rigenerazione urbana\"].\n\nA similar concept was carried out by [[Lombardy]] Region by mean of its Regional Law of 26 November 2019 - n. 18 \"Simplification and incentive measures for urban and territorial regeneration, as well as for the recovery of existing building heritage. Changes and addendums to the regional law 11 March 2005, n. 12 (Law for the Government of the Territory) and other regional laws \"[https://unitedrisk.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/LR-18-2019-rigenerazione-urbana.pdf Legge Regione Lombardia 18/2019].\n\nThis law defines the urban regeneration as \"the coordinated set of urban-building interventions and social initiatives that can include replacement, re-use, redevelopment of the built environment and reorganization of the urban landscape by mean of recovery of degraded, underused or abandoned areas, as well as through the creation and management of infrastructure, green spaces and services [\u2026] with a horizon towards sustainability and environmental and social resilience, technological innovation and increasing biodiversity\" (Art 2. L.R.18/2019).\n\nThe same law introduces some rewards reserved to whom builds for social purposes. Moreover, these rewards are also reserved for those who carry on some particular implementation models. For instance,  you can increase the volume of your building whenever \"integrated safety systems and construction site risk management processes are applied; methods that are based on traceability and control activities, with particular reference to soil movement and waste traceability, based on advanced technologies\", the increase in the building index is recognized in the art. 3 and these rewards are also given when technologies as geolocation, video surveillance and perimeter protection are implemented in order to prevent the \"risk of crime during all phases of construction sites\" [https://unitedrisk.eu/la-legalita-per-la-rigenerazione-urbana/ La legalit\u00e0 per la rigenerazione urbana: a law analysis].\n\n===United States===\n[[File:Fairbanks, Alaska aerial, downtown urban renewal zone, early 1960s.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of downtown [[Fairbanks, Alaska]] in the early 1960s, showing the area cleared in [[Alaska]]'s first urban renewal project.]]\nLarge scale urban renewal projects in the US started in the [[interwar period]] as an attempt to clear out blight inner cities. Prototype urban renewal projects include the design and construction of [[Central Park]] in New York and the 1909 Plan for Chicago by [[Daniel Burnham]]. Similarly, the efforts of [[Jacob Riis]] in advocating for the demolition of degraded areas of New York in the late 19th century was also formative. The redevelopment of large sections of [[New York City]] and [[New York State]] by [[Robert Moses]] between the 1930s and the 1970s was a notable and prominent example of urban redevelopment. Moses directed the construction of new [[bridge]]s, [[highway]]s, [[Public Housing in the United States|housing project]]s, and [[park|public parks]].\n\nOther cities across the USA began to create redevelopment programs in the late 1930s and 1940s. These early projects were generally focused on [[slum clearance]] and were implemented by local [[public housing authorities]], which were responsible both for clearing slums and for building new affordable housing. The [[City Planning and Housing Council]] (CHPC) founded in 1937 had a large hand in the reconstruction of urban slums, with their primary mission being the elimination of poor housing conditions, creating less crowded and cleaner public housing.<ref name=\"Sugrue\">{{Cite book|title=The Origins of the Urban Crisis: Race and Inequality in Postwar Detroit|last=Sugrue|first=Thomas J.|date=2014-01-31|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9781400851218|location=Princeton|doi = 10.1515/9781400851218}}</ref>\n\nIn 1944, the [[GI Bill]] (officially the Serviceman's Readjustment Act) guaranteed [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Administration]] (VA) mortgages to veterans under favorable terms, which fueled suburbanization after the end of [[World War II]], as places like [[Levittown, New York]], [[Warren, Michigan]] and the [[San Fernando Valley]] of [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] were transformed from farmland into cities occupied by tens of thousands of families in a few years. However, the GI Bill was primarily beneficial for white veterans over black ones, so in inner cities where black veterans tried using the benefits from the GI bill to occur housing and/or jobs, it was much more difficult.<ref name=\"Sugrue\"/>\n\nThe [[Housing Act of 1949]], also known as the Taft-Ellender-Wagner Act, provided federal loans to cities to acquire and clear slum areas to be sold to private developers to redevelop in accordance with a plan prepared by the city (normally with new housing), and grants to cover two-thirds of the portion of the city's costs in excess of the sale prices received from the developers, as well as provide millions of dollars to create public housing throughout the country.<ref name=\"Sugrue\"/> The phrase used at the time was \"urban redevelopment\". \"Urban renewal\" was a phrase popularized with the passage of the [[Housing Act of 1954]], which made these projects more enticing to developers by, among other things, providing mortgages backed by the [[Federal Housing Administration]] (FHA).\n\nThe term \"urban renewal\" was not introduced in the USA until the Housing Act was again amended in 1954. That was also the year in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] upheld the general validity of urban redevelopment statutes in the landmark case, ''[[Berman v.

The efforts of the CHPC and the FHA to renew Detroit caused huge amounts of black displacement due to the construction of highways and airports directly through black neighborhoods like [[8 Mile City|8-mile]] and [[Paradise Valley, Detroit|Paradise Valley]]. Black families were thrown out from their homes and not provided relocation services. The \"slums\" being cleared or being looked at for redevelopment were primarily black neighborhoods.<ref name=\"Sugrue\"/>\n\nIn 1956, the [[Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956|Federal-Aid Highway Act]] gave state and federal government complete control over new highways, and often they were routed directly through vibrant urban neighborhoods\u2014isolating or destroying many\u2014since the focus of the program was to bring traffic in and out of the central cores of cities as expeditiously as possible and nine out of every ten dollars spent came from the federal government.

This came to be seen as a tragedy by many residents and [[urban planner]]s, and one of the centerpieces of the redevelopment\u2014[[Government Center, Boston, Massachusetts|Government Center]]\u2014is still considered an example of the excesses of urban renewal.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n====Reaction====\nIn 1961, [[Jane Jacobs]] published ''[[The Death and Life of Great American Cities]]'', one of the first\u2014and strongest\u2014critiques of contemporary large-scale urban renewal. However, it would still be a few years before organized movements began to oppose urban renewal. The [[Rondout, New York|Rondout]] neighborhood in Kingston, New York (on the Hudson River) was essentially destroyed by a federally funded urban renewal program in the 1960s, with more than 400 old buildings demolished, most of them historic brick structures built in the 19th century. Similarly ill-conceived urban renewal programs gutted the historic centers of other towns and cities across America in the 1950s and 1960s (for example the [[West End, Boston|West End]] neighborhood in Boston, the downtown area of [[Norfolk, Virginia]] and the historic waterfront areas of the towns of [[Narragansett, Rhode Island|Narragansett]] and [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]] in Rhode Island).\n\nBy the 1970s many major cities developed opposition to the sweeping urban-renewal plans for their cities. In [[Boston]], community activists halted construction of the proposed [[Southwest Corridor (Boston)|Southwest Expressway]] but only after a three-mile long stretch of land had been cleared. In [[San Francisco]], [[Joseph Alioto]] was the first mayor to publicly repudiate the policy of urban renewal, and with the backing of community groups, forced the state to end construction of highways through the heart of the city. [[Atlanta]] lost over 60,000 people between 1960 and 1970 because of urban renewal and expressway construction,<ref>\"Lewyn, Michael.  How City Hall Causes Sprawl,\" p. 3, ECOLOGY LAW QUARTERLY, VOL. 30, NO. 189, 2003.  http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=816864</ref> but a downtown building boom turned the city into the showcase of the [[New South]] in the 1970s and 1980s. In the early 1970s in [[Toronto]] Jacobs was heavily involved in a group which halted the construction of the [[Spadina Expressway]] and altered transport policy in that city.\n\nSome of the policies around urban renewal began to change under President [[Lyndon Johnson]] and the [[War on Poverty]], and in 1968, the [[Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968|Housing and Urban Development Act]] and The New Communities Act of 1968 guaranteed private financing for private entrepreneurs to plan and develop new communities. Subsequently, the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 established the [[Community Development Block Grant]] program (CDBG) which began in earnest the focus on redevelopment of existing neighborhoods and properties, rather than demolition of substandard housing and economically depressed areas.\n\nCurrently, a mix of renovation, selective demolition, commercial development, and tax incentives is most often used to revitalize urban neighborhoods. An example of an entire eradication of a community is [[Africville]] in [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]]. [[Gentrification]] is still controversial, and often results in familiar patterns of poorer residents being priced out of urban areas into suburbs or more depressed areas of cities. Some programs, such as that administered by [[Fresh Ministries]] and Operation New Hope in [[Jacksonville, Florida]], and the Hill Community Development Corporation (Hill CDC) in Pittsburgh's historic [[Hill District (Pittsburgh)|Hill District]] attempt to develop communities, while at the same time combining highly favorable loan programs with financial literacy education so that poorer residents are not displaced.\n\nAn example of urban renewal gone wrong in the United States is in downtown [[Niagara Falls, New York]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Most of the original downtown was demolished in the 1960s, and many replacement projects including the [[Rainbow Centre Factory Outlet]], [[Niagara Falls Convention and Civic Center]], the Native American Cultural Center, the Hooker Chemical (later the [[Occidental Petroleum]]) Headquarters building, the Wintergarden, the [[Fallsville Splash Park]], a large parking ramp, an enclosed pedestrian walkway, the Falls Street Faire & Falls Street Station entertainment complexes, sections of the [[Robert Moses State Parkway]], and the Mayor E. Dent Lackey Plaza closed within twenty to thirty years of their construction. In several American cities, some demolished blocks were never replaced.\n\nUltimately, the former tourist district of the city along Falls Street was destroyed. It went against the principles of several urban philosophers, such as [[Jane Jacobs]], who claimed that mixed-use districts were needed (which the new downtown was not) and arteries needed to be kept open. Smaller buildings also should be built or kept. In Niagara Falls, however, the convention center blocked traffic into the city, located in the center of Falls Street (the main artery), and the Wintergarden also blocked traffic from the convention center to the [[Niagara Falls]]. The Rainbow Centre interrupted the street grid, taking up three blocks, and parking ramps isolated the city from the core, leading to the degradation of nearby neighborhoods. Tourists were forced to walk around the Rainbow Center, the Wintergarden, and the Quality Inn (all of which were adjacent), in total five blocks, discouraging small business in the city.\n\n==Pros and cons==\nUrban renewal sometimes lives up to the hopes of its original proponents \u2013 it has been assessed by politicians, [[urban planner]]s, civic leaders, and residents \u2013 it has played an undeniably{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} important if controversial role. But at other times urban redevelopment projects have failed in several American cities, having wasted large amounts of public funds to no purpose.\n\nReplenished housing stock might be an improvement in quality; it may increase density and reduce [[urban sprawl|sprawl]]; it might have economic benefits and improve the global economic competitiveness of a city's centre. It may, in some instances, improve cultural and social amenity, and it may also improve opportunities for safety and surveillance. Developments such as London Docklands increased tax revenues for government. In late 1964, the British commentator Neil Wates expressed the opinion that urban renewal in the United States had 'demonstrated the tremendous advantages which flow from an urban renewal programme,' such as remedying the 'personal problems' of the poor, creation or renovation of housing stock, educational and cultural 'opportunities'.<ref>Neil Wates, 'Urban renewal: US and UK' New Society 31 December 1964, p. 15</ref> In the United States successful urban redevelopment projects tend to revitalize downtown areas, but have not been successful in revitalizing cities as a whole. The process has often resulted in the displacement of low-income city inhabitants when their dwellings were taken and demolished. Eventually, urban redevelopment became an engine of construction of shopping malls, automobile factories and dealerships, \"large box\" department stores (like Target, Costco and Best Buy). Thus, in Washington, DC, the famous (or notorious) Southwest Washington renewal project (see [[Berman v. Parker]]) displaced thousands of largely African-American families, but provided them with no replacement housing because at the time (1954) the law did not provide for any. Also, the version of the project that was approved by the U.S. Supreme Court in Berman, provided for low-cost replacement housing, one-third of which was to rent for $17/room/month, but after the court's decision, that provision in the local law was repealed.\n\nReplacement housing \u2013 particularly in the form of high-rise housing for low-income tenants \u2013 has not been successful. These projects are difficult to police, leading to an increase in crime, and such structures might in themselves be dehumanizing. Public housing projects like [[Cabrini-Green]] in [[Chicago]] and [[Pruitt-Igoe]] in [[St. Louis]] became so bad that they had to be demolished.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=15em}}\n* [[Adaptive reuse]]\n* [[Big City Plan]]\n* [[Community development]]\n* [[Cost overrun]]\n* [[Environmental racism]]\n* [[Gentrification]]\n* [[Housing Market Renewal Initiative]]\n* [[List of planned cities]]\n* [[List of urban planners]]\n* [[Megaproject]]\n* [[New town]]\n* [[New Urbanism]]\n* [[Overspill estate]]\n* [[Phase I environmental site assessment]]\n* [[Principles of Intelligent Urbanism]]\n* [[Slum upgrading]]\n* [[Temporary use]]\n* [[Urban decay]]\n* [[Urban economics]]\n* [[Urban renaissance]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Klemek, Christopher (2011).

He was also used as a [[Pinch Hitter]] in the [[1918 World Series]], hitting a single in the eighth inning of Game 4 after a leadoff walk that started a two run rally for the Cubs, but lost 3-2.\n\nAccording to \"Striking Out a Baseball Myth\", by Amy Geiszler-Jones, \"Hendrix was a right-handed pitcher who \"could work the spitball to perfection\", according to Wichita newspaper reports, he led the National League with his winning percentage in 1912 and 1918 and played in the 1918 World Series. Hendrix had the distinction of being the winning pitcher in the first game in the ballpark later renamed Wrigley Field.\n\n\"Hendrix's link to one of baseball's most notorious gambling scandals tainted his legacy in baseball.\n\n\"The 1919 World Series, it was discovered in grand jury hearings held in 1920, was thrown by several Chicago White Sox players.

Cubs president [[Bill Veeck]] received telephone calls and telegrams saying Detroit gamblers were betting heavily that the Phillies, ranked at the bottom of the league, would beat the Cubs, a top team. The Cubs switched their rotation and went with their better pitcher, [[Grover Cleveland Alexander]], instead but still ended up losing the game.\n\n\"A grand jury was convened in Chicago to investigate this particular incident, and during the course of the investigation the Black Sox scandal emerged. It never ruled on whether the Cubs/Phillies game was linked to gambling.\n\n\"In the aftermath, federal judge [[Kenesaw Mountain Landis]] was appointed baseball's first commissioner and he banned the White Sox players from the sport.\n\n\"Landis never banned Hendrix.
