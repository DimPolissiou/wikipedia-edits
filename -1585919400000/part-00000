No!! rebellion saw many of the school windows broken and its furniture burnt before the boys withdrew to an island on the school grounds. A local [[justice of the peace]] read the [[Riot Act]], while soldiers crossed the island's moat from the rear and took the boys prisoner.\n\nThe rebellion was only one of several that took place at Rugby.

According to the [[sociologist]]s Kenneth Sheard and [[Eric Dunning]], the reason lay in the balance of power between pupils and masters. Because the children of the [[upper class]] had previously been educated at home by tutors, these took the position of paid staff, and were therefore seen as socially inferior by their pupils. Sheard and Dunning consider that the tutors, \"confronted with pupils who were aristocrats and gentlemen,&nbsp;... became hesitant and uncertain in the execution of their role\".{{sfn|Dunning|Sheard|2005|p=38}}\n\nAt its worst, the breakdown in discipline led pupil rebellions at several institutions. In 1710 the pupils of Winchester rebelled over their beer ration. The school further rebelled in 1770, 1774, 1788 and 1793; Eton revolted in 1728, 1768 and 1783; Harrow had their protest in 1771; and Rugby's first revolt came in 1786.

He was appointed to the position in 1794 after having been the headmaster at Macclesfield School. A gloomy man and a strict disciplinarian, the pupils nicknamed him the Black Tiger.{{sfn|Rouse|1898|p=177}}{{sfn|Bradby|1900|p=44}}\n\n==November 1797==\n[[File:The Island, Rugby School.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The Island, a [[Bronze Age]] [[Tumulus|burial mound]], at Rugby School]]\nIn November 1797 Ingles found Astley, a pupil from Gascoigne's [[House system|boarding house]], firing cork bullets at the study windows of Mr Gascoigne, the housemaster. Ingles asked the boy where he had purchased the [[gunpowder]], and was informed it was from Rowell's, a local outlet that combined a grocers, booksellers and ironmongers.{{sfn|Rouse|1898|pp=182\u2013183}}{{sfn|Bradby|1900|p=44}} When Ingles confronted Rowell, the shopkeeper denied selling the powder and showed Ingles his sales book, in which the sale had been recorded as tea. Ingles took the shopkeeper's word over that of Astley, and the boy was flogged for lying. Astley told his friends about the flogging and the reason for it. Angered, Astley's friends smashed the windows of Rowell's.{{sfn|Staunton|1865|p=362}}{{sfn|Bloxam|1889|p=65}}\n\nWhen Ingles heard of the vandalism, he said that all the members of the fifth and sixth forms would pay for the damage.

The windows of the main building were all broken and the school's furniture\u2014including its [[Panelling#Wainscot panelling|wainscot panelling]]\u2014were thrown into the Close, the large main field in front of the school, where it was set alight.

Ingles sent messages for them to return, but most were too far away to be found (two were fishing in the [[River Avon, Warwickshire|River Avon]], another was out shooting rabbits).{{sfn|Bradby|1900|pp=45\u201346}} Ingles sent a message to Mr Butlin, a local banker and the town's [[justice of the peace]]. It was market day in Rugby, so Butlin asked the horse-dealers, with their long [[droving]] whips to assist. He also asked an army recruitment party, headed by a [[sergeant]], for their assistance. An armed guard, with [[fixed bayonet]], was placed at School House, and the remainder of the soldiers, together with the horse-dealers and special constables, approached the Close.{{sfn|Rouse|1898|p=184}}\n\nThe rebellious schoolboys left the bonfire of furniture, and retreated to \"the Island\", a [[Bronze Age]] [[Tumulus|burial mound]] on the side of the Close, surrounded by a water [[moat]], up to {{convert|6|ft|m|1}} deep and {{convert|20|to|30|ft|m|1}} wide; after crossing the ditch, the boys drew up the wooden drawbridge.{{sfn|Bloxam|1889|p=66}}{{sfn|\"Rugby School \u2013 History\".

He immediately expelled the ringleaders and had many others flogged.{{sfn|Bloxam|1889|p=66}}{{sfn|Rouse|1898|p=185}} One of the ringleaders was subsequently identified as [[Willoughby Cotton]] who entered the army shortly afterwards and led troops in Jamaica to put down a slave rebellion in 1831;{{sfn|Chichester|Lunt|2011}}{{sfn|Chandos|1984|p=179}} of those expelled, one later became a [[bishop]], another a [[marquess]].{{sfn|\"A Visit to Rugby\".

He has left everyone with the impression of sunshine, handsomeness and versatile healing department warm men (China Entertainment Network Review)   .\nLi belongs to the kind of simmering actor. From the forest team in Forensic Qin Ming to the Guo team in River God, Li Xian is just right on the tough and handsome role. Each of Li Xian's works has a good response. The characters he plays each time are also very characteristic and individual, and he also sees his unique vision. The \"sculpture-like\" figure, the hormonal breath, also reflects his self-discipline and strict requirements on himself (reviewed by Xinhua News, New Express, and Peninsula Metropolis Daily). Li's eyes can speak, and his eyes can pass on the character's soul. His performance is delicate and layered. He can capture people's hearts by his face value, but he is a \u201cnaughter\u201d with strong acting skills. In the face of different situations, his performance instantly switches like a chameleon.

The centre was a learning resource for pupils. It has since closed.\n\nThe Ferguson Building (opened 2007) was added to the school campus providing a lecture theatre, IT suite and Sixth Form Centre. The Ferguson Lectures were launched at the same time. These focus on contemporary issues and are open to the public. Ferguson lecturers have included Dr Rowan Williams, Master of Magdalene College, Cambridge and a former Archbishop of Canterbury, Brendan Simms, Professor in the History of International Relations at Peterhouse, Cambridge, Jonathan Bartley, co-leader of the Green Party of England and Wales, and Tom Holland, a writer, broadcaster and historian.\n\nThe latest major development project, which opened in autumn 2013, saw the rebuilding and expansion of approximately one-third of the Prep School to provide enhanced and extended accommodation, including a new library. The Dawson building was officially named and opened on 20 September 2014 after John and Joy Dawson by David Defoe who was The Master of the Junior School (now known as the Prep School) from 1982-1999. Having joined the school in 1948, John Dawson was Headmaster of the Junior School (1971-1982). Joy joined the school as a nurse in 1949 and later married John. They were houseparents of Grimwade 1966\u20141971 until John became Headmaster.\n\nOn 29 September 2015, a fire broke out in Robert Pearce House and destroyed the 92-year-old building. All pupils were evacuated safely. Robert Pearce House reopened in January 2018.\n\nIn January 2016 the college donated second hand textbooks to [[Edlumino]], an organisation working to educate children in the refugee camps at [[Grande-Synthe]] and [[Calais]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The College donates books to Edlumino Education Aid|url=http://www.bishopsstortfordcollege.org/206/latest-news/post/66/the-college-donates-books-to-edlumino-educational-aid|website=Bishop's Stortford College|accessdate=26 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304094123/http://www.bishopsstortfordcollege.org/206/latest-news/post/66/the-college-donates-books-to-edlumino-educational-aid|archive-date=4 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nNew boarding houses for sixth-former students were built and opened in 2018.\n\n== Present day ==\nThere are 1180 pupils at Bishop's Stortford College, including 600 in the Senior School (aged 14-18), 460 in the Prep School (aged 8-13) and 120 in the Pre-Prep (aged 4-7).

The centre was a learning resource for pupils. It has since closed.\n\nThe Ferguson Building (opened 2007) was added to the school campus providing a lecture theatre, IT suite and Sixth Form Centre. The Ferguson Lectures were launched at the same time. These focus on contemporary issues and are open to the public. Ferguson lecturers have included Dr Rowan Williams, Master of Magdalene College, Cambridge and a former Archbishop of Canterbury, Brendan Simms, Professor in the History of International Relations at Peterhouse, Cambridge, Jonathan Bartley, co-leader of the Green Party of England and Wales, and Tom Holland, a writer, broadcaster and historian.\n\nThe latest major development project, which opened in autumn 2013, saw the rebuilding and expansion of approximately one-third of the Prep School to provide enhanced and extended accommodation, including a new library. The Dawson building was officially named and opened on 20 September 2014 after John and Joy Dawson by David Defoe who was The Master of the Junior School (now known as the Prep School) from 1982-1999. Having joined the school in 1948, John Dawson was Headmaster of the Junior School (1971-1982). Joy joined the school as a nurse in 1949 and later married John. They were houseparents of Grimwade 1966\u20141971 until John became Headmaster.\n\nOn 29 September 2015, a fire broke out in Robert Pearce House and destroyed the 92-year-old building. All pupils were evacuated safely. Robert Pearce House reopened in January 2018.\n\nIn January 2016 the college donated second hand textbooks to [[Edlumino]], an organisation working to educate children in the refugee camps at [[Grande-Synthe]] and [[Calais]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The College donates books to Edlumino Education Aid|url=http://www.bishopsstortfordcollege.org/206/latest-news/post/66/the-college-donates-books-to-edlumino-educational-aid|website=Bishop's Stortford College|accessdate=26 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304094123/http://www.bishopsstortfordcollege.org/206/latest-news/post/66/the-college-donates-books-to-edlumino-educational-aid|archive-date=4 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nNew boarding houses for sixth-former students were built and opened in 2018.\n\n== Present day ==\nThere are 1180 pupils at Bishop's Stortford College, including 600 in the Senior School (aged 14-18), 460 in the Prep School (aged 8-13) and 120 in the Pre-Prep (aged 4-7).

The incumbent [[district collector]] is Ashwin Mudgal.{{citation needed lead|date=March 2018}}\n\n==History==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018|This is quite well-written but, sadly, unsourced.}}\nIt is believed that Yavatmal, along with the rest of the former [[Berar Province|Berar]] province, was part of the legendary kingdom of [[Vidarbha]] mentioned in the ''[[Mahabharata]]''.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Berar also formed part of the [[Mauryan Empire]] during the reign of [[Ashoka]] (272 to 231&nbsp;BCE). Berar later came under the rule of the [[Satavahana]] dynasty ({{nowrap|2nd century BCE}} to {{nowrap|2nd century CE}}), the [[Vakataka]] dynasty (3rd to 6th centuries), the [[Chalukya]] dynasty (6th to 8th centuries), the [[Rashtrakuta]] dynasty (8th to 10th centuries), the [[Western Chalukya]] (10th to 12th centuries), and finally the [[Yadava dynasty]] of [[Daulatabad, Maharashtra|Devagiri]] (late 12th to early 14th centuries). A period of [[Muslim]] rule began when [[Ala ud din Khilji]], [[Delhi Sultanate|Sultan of Delhi]], conquered the region in the early 14th century. The region was part of the [[Bahmani Sultanate]], which broke away from the Delhi Sultanate in the mid-14th century. The Bahmani Sultanate broke into smaller sultanates at the end of the 15th century, and in 1572 Berar became part of the [[Nizam Shahi]] sultanate, based at [[Ahmednagar]]. The Nizam Shahis ceded Berar to the [[Mughal Empire]] in 1595. As Mughal rule started to unravel at the start of the 18th century, [[Asaf Jah&nbsp;I]], [[Nizam]] of [[Hyderabad state|Hyderabad]], seized the southern provinces of the empire (including Berar) in 1724, forming an independent state.\n\nA detailed account of [[Berar Subah|Berar]] was added to the Ain-i-Akbari in 1596\u201397, immediately after the treaty of Ahmadnagar under which the province was ceded to the Mughal Empire; this account may be regarded as a description of the province as it was administered by the Nizam Sahi and Imad Sahi kings, and probably also by the Bahamanis. The account notes that Berar was divided into thirteen sarkars or revenue districts. The Yavatmal district comprised the greater part of Akbar's sarkars of Kalam and Mahur. But some few mahals of these sarkars lay beyond the present limits of the district. Yavatmal appears in the record as the headquarters of a pargana under the name of Yot-Lohara \u2013 ''Yot'' being the Urdu or Persian corruption of ''Yevata'', the original name of the town; and ''Lohara'' the name of a village about {{convert|3|mi|km|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} to the west of Yavatmal. The suffix ''mal'' is a corruption of ''mahal'' (pargana-town). A rough estimate makes the land revenue demand in Akbar's time for the area now occupied by the district more than ten lakhs (one million) rupees, while it is certain that collection must have fallen far short of the nominal demand.\n\nIn 1853 the district, together with the rest of Berar, came under the administration of the [[British East India Company]]. Berar was divided into East Berar and West Berar with Yavatmal district included in the former. In 1864 Yavatmal, along with some other ''[[taluka]]s'', was formed into the district initially called Southeast Berar and later renamed Wani. In 1903 Berar was leased by the [[Nizam of Hyderabad]] to the British Government of India.\n\nCotton was invented{{clarify|date=March 2018}} in Yavatmal by \"guttsam rishi\".{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n== {{anchor|Geographical Area, Area and Boundary|Location and area|Boundary}}Geography ==\n{{more footnotes|section|date=March 2018}}\nYavatmal District is situated in the south-western part of Wardha Penganga-Wainganga basin. The geographical location of the district falls in 19.26 and 20.42 north latitudes and 77.18 to 7.9.9 in the eastern line. Amravati and Wardha districts, from east to Chandrapur district, Andhra Pradesh and Nanded district are from the north whereas Parbhani and Akola districts are surrounded by west.{{incomprehensible inline|date=March 2018}}<ref name=\"location\">{{cite web|url=https://yavatmal.gov.in/geographical-information|title=Yavatmal District Geographical Information|language=mr}}</ref>\n\nThe district covers {{convert|13,582|km2|abbr=on}} (4.41 percent of the state). The total length of the district is {{convert|120|mi|km|order=flip}}, and the maximum width from north to south is {{convert|100|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}}. The district occupies the southeastern part of Berar.\n\nYavatmal district is in the southern mountain ranges of Berar, situated on a wide plain surrounded by hilly terrain and mountain ranges running east to west. The central part is a plateau {{convert|300|to|600|m}} above sea level. On its northern border is the Panighat, called the valley of Berar, which is {{convert|65|to|80|km}} wide; only a {{convert|8|to|12|km|mi|0|adj=mid|-wide}} portion of the valley is within Yavatmal district.\n\nThe two main rivers are the [[Painganga River|Penganga]] and [[Wardha River|Wardha]]. The Wardha originates in Madhya Pradesh. The Penganga river is the main tributary of the Wardha, and marks the southern boundary of the district before joining the Wardha. The Wardha's other tributaries include the Banembala and Nirguda, which flow only during the monsoon season. Other rivers include the Bembala and Nirguda rivers on the Yavatmal Plateau.\n\n== {{anchor|Rain|Weather}}Climate==\n\nThe climate is dry and hot in summer with a moderately cold winter. The year is divided into four seasons: summer (March to May), southwest monsoon season (June to September), northern monsoon season (October to November), and winter (December to February).\n\nThe district receives an average annual rainfall of {{convert|911.34|mm|in|0|abbr=on}}. This generally increases from west to east, with {{convert|889|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} in the western region of the district and {{convert|1125|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} in the east. Almost all of the rain falls during the southwest monsoon season.

The incumbent [[district collector]] is Ashwin Mudgal.{{citation needed lead|date=March 2018}}\n\n==History==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018|This is quite well-written but, sadly, unsourced.}}\nIt is believed that Yavatmal, along with the rest of the former [[Berar Province|Berar]] province, was part of the legendary kingdom of [[Vidarbha]] mentioned in the ''[[Mahabharata]]''.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Berar also formed part of the [[Mauryan Empire]] during the reign of [[Ashoka]] (272 to 231&nbsp;BCE). Berar later came under the rule of the [[Satavahana]] dynasty ({{nowrap|2nd century BCE}} to {{nowrap|2nd century CE}}), the [[Vakataka]] dynasty (3rd to 6th centuries), the [[Chalukya]] dynasty (6th to 8th centuries), the [[Rashtrakuta]] dynasty (8th to 10th centuries), the [[Western Chalukya]] (10th to 12th centuries), and finally the [[Yadava dynasty]] of [[Daulatabad, Maharashtra|Devagiri]] (late 12th to early 14th centuries). A period of [[Muslim]] rule began when [[Ala ud din Khilji]], [[Delhi Sultanate|Sultan of Delhi]], conquered the region in the early 14th century. The region was part of the [[Bahmani Sultanate]], which broke away from the Delhi Sultanate in the mid-14th century. The Bahmani Sultanate broke into smaller sultanates at the end of the 15th century, and in 1572 Berar became part of the [[Nizam Shahi]] sultanate, based at [[Ahmednagar]]. The Nizam Shahis ceded Berar to the [[Mughal Empire]] in 1595. As Mughal rule started to unravel at the start of the 18th century, [[Asaf Jah&nbsp;I]], [[Nizam]] of [[Hyderabad state|Hyderabad]], seized the southern provinces of the empire (including Berar) in 1724, forming an independent state.\n\nA detailed account of [[Berar Subah|Berar]] was added to the Ain-i-Akbari in 1596\u201397, immediately after the treaty of Ahmadnagar under which the province was ceded to the Mughal Empire; this account may be regarded as a description of the province as it was administered by the Nizam Sahi and Imad Sahi kings, and probably also by the Bahamanis. The account notes that Berar was divided into thirteen sarkars or revenue districts. The Yavatmal district comprised the greater part of Akbar's sarkars of Kalam and Mahur. But some few mahals of these sarkars lay beyond the present limits of the district. Yavatmal appears in the record as the headquarters of a pargana under the name of Yot-Lohara \u2013 ''Yot'' being the Urdu or Persian corruption of ''Yevata'', the original name of the town; and ''Lohara'' the name of a village about {{convert|3|mi|km|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} to the west of Yavatmal. The suffix ''mal'' is a corruption of ''mahal'' (pargana-town). A rough estimate makes the land revenue demand in Akbar's time for the area now occupied by the district more than ten lakhs (one million) rupees, while it is certain that collection must have fallen far short of the nominal demand.\n\nIn 1853 the district, together with the rest of Berar, came under the administration of the [[British East India Company]]. Berar was divided into East Berar and West Berar with Yavatmal district included in the former. In 1864 Yavatmal, along with some other ''[[taluka]]s'', was formed into the district initially called Southeast Berar and later renamed Wani. In 1903 Berar was leased by the [[Nizam of Hyderabad]] to the British Government of India.\n\nCotton was invented{{clarify|date=March 2018}} in Yavatmal by \"guttsam rishi\".{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n== {{anchor|Geographical Area, Area and Boundary|Location and area|Boundary}}Geography ==\n{{more footnotes|section|date=March 2018}}\nYavatmal District is situated in the south-western part of Wardha Penganga-Wainganga basin.

The district occupies the southeastern part of Berar. \n\nYavatmal district is in the southern mountain ranges of Berar, situated on a wide plain surrounded by hilly terrain and mountain ranges running east to west. The central part is a plateau {{convert|300|to|600|m}} above sea level. On its northern border is the Panighat, called the valley of Berar, which is {{convert|65|to|80|km}} wide; only a {{convert|8|to|12|km|mi|0|adj=mid|-wide}} portion of the valley is within Yavatmal district.\n\nThe two main rivers are the [[Painganga River|Penganga]] and [[Wardha River|Wardha]]. The Wardha originates in Madhya Pradesh. The Penganga river is the main tributary of the Wardha, and marks the southern boundary of the district before joining the Wardha. The Wardha's other tributaries include the Banembala and Nirguda, which flow only during the monsoon season. Other rivers include the Bembala and Nirguda rivers on the Yavatmal Plateau.\n\n== {{anchor|Rain|Weather}}Climate==\n\nThe climate is dry and hot in summer with a moderately cold winter. The year is divided into four seasons: summer (March to May), southwest monsoon season (June to September), northern monsoon season (October to November), and winter (December to February).\n\nThe district receives an average annual rainfall of {{convert|911.34|mm|in|0|abbr=on}}. This generally increases from west to east, with {{convert|889|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} in the western region of the district and {{convert|1125|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} in the east.

A traditional scuttle resembles a [[teapot]] with a wide spout where hot water is poured in; this is where it differs from a shaving mug, which has no spout. Both shaving scuttles and mugs usually have a handle, but some have none. Shaving mugs often look like a standard mug, however, some also have a built in brush rest, so the brush does not sit in lather.

Traditionally, it was used with a hard block of shaving soap (rather than soft soap or cream) and therefore had drain holes at the bottom.

Some scuttles and mugs have concentric circles on the bottom, which retain some water thus helping to build lather.<ref name=sara/>\n\nIn use, the [[shaving brush]] is dunked into the wide spout, allowing it to soak into the water and heat up. The soap is placed in the soap holder. When needed, one can take the brush and brush it against the soap, bringing up a layer of lather; excess water is drained back.

One example is a mug with multiple holes in the rim, making it impossible to drink from it in the normal way. Although it is tempting to grasp the body of the mug covering the visible holes and drink the liquid in the usual manner, this would pour the liquid through hidden perforations near the mug's top. The solution is to cover the holes in the rim with hands, but to drink not through the top, but through a \"secret\" hole in the hollow handle.<ref name=puzzle>{{cite news|url=http://ceramicstoday.com/articles/puzzle_mug.htm |title=In Their Cups \u2013 The Story of the English Puzzle Mug |author=Delia Robinson |work=Ceramics Today |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103221715/http://ceramicstoday.com/articles/puzzle_mug.htm |archivedate=January 3, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nA puzzle mug called ''[[fuddling cup]]s'' consists of three mugs connected through their walls and handles. The inner holes in the mugs walls are designed in such a way that the mugs must be emptied in a unique sequence, or they will drain.<ref name=puzzle/>\n\nThe [[Pythagorean cup]] (see picture) contains a small [[siphon]] hidden in a rod placed in the mug center. The cup holds liquid if filled below the height of the rod, but once filled above that level, it drains all liquid through the siphon to a hole in its base.\n\n===Heat changing mugs===\n[[File:Thermochromic mug.webm|thumb|right|Video of hot water being poured into a \"magic mug\" and the subsequent colour change|alt=Hot water is poured into a black mug, over about 20 seconds most of the mug changes colour to white, revealing black logo markings]]\nHeat changing, heat sensitive, or [[magic mug]]s make use of [[thermochromism]] to change appearance when a hot beverage is poured into them.\n\n==General design and functions==\nMuch of the mug design aims at thermal insulation: the thick walls of a mug, as compared to the thinner walls of teacups, insulate the beverage to prevent it from cooling or warming quickly. The mug bottom is often not flat, but either concave or has an extra rim, to reduce the thermal contact with the surface on which a mug is placed. These features often leave a characteristic circular stain on the surface. Finally, the handle of a mug keeps the hand away from the hot sides of a mug. The small cross section of the handle reduces heat flow between the liquid and the hand. For the same reason of thermal insulation, mugs are usually made of materials with low [[thermal conductivity]], such as [[earthenware]], [[bone china]], [[porcelain]], or glass.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fJw0K1ZGY1kC&pg=PA98|page=98|title=The really useful science book: a framework of knowledge for primary teachers|author=Steve Farrow|publisher=Routledge|year=1999|isbn=0-7507-0983-9}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=esDW3xTKoLIC&pg=PA27|page=27|title=The handbook of evolutionary psychology|author=David M.

Carving had been traditionally applied to mugs in the ancient times. Deforming a mug into an unusual shape is sometimes used. However, the most popular decoration technique nowadays is printing on mugs, which is usually performed as follows: Ceramic powder is mixed with dyes of chosen color and a plasticizer. Then it is printed on a gelatin-coated paper using a traditional [[screen-printing]] technique, which applies the mixture through a fine woven mesh, which is stretched on a frame and has a mask of desired shape. This technique produces a thin homogeneous coating; however, if smoothness is not required, the ceramic mixture is painted directly with a brush. Another, more complex alternative is to coat the paper with a photographic emulsion, photoprint the image and then cure the emulsion with ultraviolet light.<ref name=print>{{cite web|title=Printing Ceramics|url=http://www.ceramicstoday.com/articles/090798.htm|publisher=Ceramics Today|access-date=2009-08-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090601072522/http://www.ceramicstoday.com/articles/090798.htm|archive-date=2009-06-01|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAfter drying, the printed paper, called a [[transfer-print|litho]], can be stored indefinitely. When a litho is applied to the mug, it is first softened in warm water. This detaches the gelatin cover, with the printed image, from the paper; this cover is then transferred to the mug. The mug is then fired around 700\u2013750&nbsp;\u00b0C, which softens the top surface of the glaze, thereby embedding the image into it.<ref name=print/>\n\n==Storage==\n[[File:Mugs hanging in a ship's mess 01A.jpg|thumb|Mug rack on a ship]]\n[[File:Mugtree1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Mug tree]]\nA popular way to store mugs is on a 'mug tree', a wooden or metal pole mounted on a round base and fitted with pegs to hang mugs by their handles.<ref>Jane Ancona, Bruce Ancona \"Mug tree\" {{US patent|D312556}} Issue date: December 4, 1990</ref> There are also racks designed for hanging mugs so that they are ready to hand.

One example is a mug with multiple holes in the rim, making it impossible to drink from it in the normal way. Although it is tempting to grasp the body of the mug covering the visible holes and drink the liquid in the usual manner, this would pour the liquid through hidden perforations near the mug's top. The solution is to cover the holes in the rim with hands, but to drink not through the top, but through a \"secret\" hole in the hollow handle.<ref name=puzzle>{{cite news|url=http://ceramicstoday.com/articles/puzzle_mug.htm |title=In Their Cups \u2013 The Story of the English Puzzle Mug |author=Delia Robinson |work=Ceramics Today |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103221715/http://ceramicstoday.com/articles/puzzle_mug.htm |archivedate=January 3, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nA puzzle mug called ''[[fuddling cup]]s'' consists of three mugs connected through their walls and handles.

The cup holds liquid if filled below the height of the rod, but once filled above that level, it drains all liquid through the siphon to a hole in its base.\n\n===Heat changing mugs===\n[[File:Thermochromic mug.webm|thumb|right|Video of hot water being poured into a \"magic mug\" and the subsequent colour change|alt=Hot water is poured into a black mug, over about 20 seconds most of the mug changes colour to white, revealing black logo markings]]\nHeat changing, heat sensitive, or [[magic mug]]s make use of [[thermochromism]] to change appearance when a hot beverage is poured into them.\n\n==General design and functions==\nMuch of the mug design aims at thermal insulation: the thick walls of a mug, as compared to the thinner walls of teacups, insulate the beverage to prevent it from cooling or warming quickly. The mug bottom is often not flat, but either concave or has an extra rim, to reduce the thermal contact with the surface on which a mug is placed. These features often leave a characteristic circular stain on the surface. Finally, the handle of a mug keeps the hand away from the hot sides of a mug. The small cross section of the handle reduces heat flow between the liquid and the hand. For the same reason of thermal insulation, mugs are usually made of materials with low [[thermal conductivity]], such as [[earthenware]], [[bone china]], [[porcelain]], or glass.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fJw0K1ZGY1kC&pg=PA98|page=98|title=The really useful science book: a framework of knowledge for primary teachers|author=Steve Farrow|publisher=Routledge|year=1999|isbn=0-7507-0983-9}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=esDW3xTKoLIC&pg=PA27|page=27|title=The handbook of evolutionary psychology|author=David M.

Carving had been traditionally applied to mugs in the ancient times. Deforming a mug into an unusual shape is sometimes used. However, the most popular decoration technique nowadays is printing on mugs, which is usually performed as follows: Ceramic powder is mixed with dyes of chosen color and a plasticizer. Then it is printed on a gelatin-coated paper using a traditional [[screen-printing]] technique, which applies the mixture through a fine woven mesh, which is stretched on a frame and has a mask of desired shape. This technique produces a thin homogeneous coating; however, if smoothness is not required, the ceramic mixture is painted directly with a brush. Another, more complex alternative is to coat the paper with a photographic emulsion, photoprint the image and then cure the emulsion with ultraviolet light.<ref name=print>{{cite web|title=Printing Ceramics|url=http://www.ceramicstoday.com/articles/090798.htm|publisher=Ceramics Today|access-date=2009-08-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090601072522/http://www.ceramicstoday.com/articles/090798.htm|archive-date=2009-06-01|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAfter drying, the printed paper, called a [[transfer-print|litho]], can be stored indefinitely. When a litho is applied to the mug, it is first softened in warm water. This detaches the gelatin cover, with the printed image, from the paper; this cover is then transferred to the mug. The mug is then fired around 700\u2013750&nbsp;\u00b0C, which softens the top surface of the glaze, thereby embedding the image into it.<ref name=print/>\n\n==Storage==\n[[File:Mugs hanging in a ship's mess 01A.jpg|thumb|Mug rack on a ship]]\n[[File:Mugtree1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Mug tree]]\nA popular way to store mugs is on a 'mug tree', a wooden or metal pole mounted on a round base and fitted with pegs to hang mugs by their handles.<ref>Jane Ancona, Bruce Ancona \"Mug tree\" {{US patent|D312556}} Issue date: December 4, 1990</ref> There are also racks designed for hanging mugs so that they are ready to hand.

{"title_page": "Political activity of the Catholic Church on LGBT issues", "text_new": "{{Roman Catholicism}}\n{{broader|Catholic Church and homosexuality}}\n\nThe '''political activity of the Catholic Church on LGBT issues''' consists of efforts made by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] to support or oppose civil government legislation on the basis of [[Catholic moral theology]] and [[Catholic Social Teaching]] surrounding issues of importance to [[LGBT]] people.  The Church generally condemns all forms of violence against gay and lesbian people and all criminal penalties against them. However, the Church in certain countries has on occasion actively resisted efforts to decriminalize homosexuality or to introduce measures to tackle discrimination. The Catholic Church also supports legally defining marriage in civil legislation as the union of one man and one woman, therefore generally opposing efforts to introduce gay [[civil unions]] and [[gay marriage]] \u2013 although some clergymen have expressed support for same-sex unions. The Church teaches that not all discrimination is \"unjust,\" and that sometimes the rights of individuals, including gay men and women, can be limited. The Church is active in local, national, and international forums.\n\n==Dignity and rights of gay men and women==\nThe Church holds that all people, including those who are LGBT, are made in the image and likeness of God, giving every human an inherent dignity.<ref name=\"rtarz\" />  This inherent dignity forms \"the bedrock\" of [[Catholic Social Teaching]].<ref name=\"cst\" />  There is nothing that can diminish a person's \"inherent and immeasurable worth and dignity\" or the sacredness of their life, both of which \"must always be respected in word, in action and in law.\"<ref name=\"July92\" /><ref name=\"cst\" /><ref name=\"zero\" /><ref name=\"hrw\" />\n\nGiven their inherent dignity, the Catholic Church advocates for and defends the fundamental human rights \"of every person, irrespective of sexual orientation,\" including the right \"to be treated by individuals and by society with dignity, respect and fairness.\"<ref name=\"assumption\" />  Church teaching also includes the \"duty to oppose discrimination in all circumstances where a person's sexual orientation or activity cannot reasonably be regarded as relevant.\"<ref name=\"assumption\" />\n\nA 1992 letter from [[Pope Benedict XVI|Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger]] condemned [[gay bashing]].<ref name=\"reltol\" />  It said that LGBT people \"have the same rights as all persons including the right of not being treated in a manner which offends their personal dignity,\" and have the right to work, to housing, and others.<ref name=\"July92\" />  It adds that: \n \t\n<blockquote>It is deplorable that homosexual persons have been and are the object of violent malice in speech or in action. Such treatment deserves condemnation from the Church's pastors wherever it occurs. It reveals a kind of disregard for others which endangers the most fundamental principles of a healthy society. The intrinsic dignity of each person must always be respected in word, in action and in law.<ref name=\"July92\" /><ref name=\"assumption\" /></blockquote>\n\nBut at the same time Ratzinger suggested that anti-gay violence could be the fault of victims if they push too hard to seek equal rights, thereby absolving responsibility by those who engage in violent behaviour:<ref name=\"deB5B\" />\n\n<blockquote>When civil legislation is introduced to protect behavior to which no one has any conceivable right, neither the church nor society at large should be surprised when other distorted notions and practices gain ground and irrational and violent reactions increase.</blockquote>\n\nThe Church does also teach that rights to public housing, employment in certain industries, or other areas are not absolute and that they can, and sometimes should, be limited for people of all [[Sexual orientation|orientations]] to \"protect the common good.\"<ref name=\"July92\" /><ref name=\"Siker\" />{{rp|194}} Acting is this way does not constitute unjust discrimination.<ref name=\"July92\" /><ref name=\"Siker\" />{{rp|193}}<ref name=\"allen\" /> The Church teaches that sexual orientation is different from qualities such as race, ethnicity, sex, or age in that it is usually not known unless disclosed.<ref name=\"July92\" />\n\nThe [[Bishops' Conference of England and Wales]] wrote in 1979 that the Church \"has a serious responsibility to work for the elimination of any injustices perpetrated on homosexuals by society.

He added: 'Poor countries like Africa just accept it because it's imposed upon them through money, through being tied to aid.'\" He said that African bishops must react against this move against African culture.<ref name=\"zz8Xg\" /> Meanwhile, Cardinal [[Peter Turkson]], while recognising that some of the sanctions imposed on homosexuals in Africa are an \"exaggeration,\" stated that the \"intensity of the reaction is probably commensurate with tradition.\" \"Just as there's a sense of a call for rights, there's also a call to respect culture, of all kinds of people,\" he said. \"So, if it's being stigmatized, in fairness, it's probably right to find out why it is being stigmatized.\" He also called for distinction to be made between human rights and moral issues.<ref name=\"4ZzHZ\" />\n\n==Discrimination laws==\nAt a 2009 [[United Nations]] event, the Church spoke out against all forms of violence and unjust discrimination directed towards LGBT people, and opposed \"all violent or discriminatory penal legislation\" that undermines the inherent [[dignity]] of the human person.<ref name=\"zero\" />\n\n===Europe===\n\nIn 1997, Catholic bishops in Poland were successful in opposing the introduction of provisions into the country's constitution that would bar discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation.<ref name=\"polish\" /> In 2010, the [[European Union]] criticized schools and colleges owned by the Catholic Church in Poland for refusing to employ staff that were openly gay.<ref name=\"polish\" /> In January 2013, the Catholic Church in Poland publicly thanked members of parliament for voting down a bill that would have allowed same-sex civil partnerships.<ref name=\"polish\" />\n\n===Australia===\n\nIn 2018, the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference joined the [[Anglican Diocese of Sydney]] to publicly call for a religious freedom act to protect religious exemptions to discrimination laws. They said that  their teaching \"makes it clear that a gay person should be assessed for employment on the same basis as anyone else\u201d and that \"staff in a school could reasonably be expected to support the teachings of the particular religion, to not undermine that teaching and to act as role models to their students.\"<ref name=\"karp\" />\n\n===United States===\n\nIn 1975, the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops|National Conference of Catholic Bishops]] taught that LGBT people \"should not suffer prejudice against their basic human rights.

In July 2003, the hierarchy of the Catholic Church in Canada, the country's plurality religion, protested the [[Jean Chr\u00e9tien|Chr\u00e9tien]] government's plans to include same-sex couples in civil marriage.\n\nIn Spain and Portugal, Catholic leaders led the opposition to same-sex marriage, urging their followers to vote against it.  The Irish Bishops Conference stated in their submission to a constitutional convention that, if the civil definition of marriage was changed to include same-sex marriage, so that it differed from the church's own definition, they could no longer perform civil functions at weddings.\n\nChurch leaders have also opposed the introduction of gay marriage in Australia, the United Kingdom, Uruguay, Cameroon, [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Italy|Italy]], Croatia, the Philippines, and Nigeria.\n\n===Acceptance and blessings for same-sex unions===\n[[File:Antwerp July 2015-1a.jpg|thumb|Cathedral of Our Lady in Antwerp]]\nThere has been some dissent expressed in recent years by senior and notable figures in the Catholic Church on whether support should be given for homosexual unions.\n\nThe Bishop of Antwerp, [[Johan Bonny]], called in 2016 for the Church to devise a blessing for homosexual couples that would recognize the \"exclusiveness and stability\" of such unions.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} German Bishop [[Franz-Josef Bode]] has argued that debate should begin on permitting the [[blessing of same-sex unions]] in Catholic churches in Germany.<ref name=\"YIXtV\" /> German cardinal [[Reinhard Marx]] has suggested that blessings in Catholic churches for same-sex unions should be considered on a case by case basis.<ref name=\"nId8o\" />\n\nCardinal [[Rainer Woelki]], the Archbishop of Berlin, has noted the values of fidelity and reliability found in gay relationships.<ref name=\"pRVXJ\" /> Over 260 Catholic [[theologian]]s, particularly from [[Germany]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Austria]], signed a [[memorandum]] in January and February 2011, called ''[[Church 2011]].'' It said that the Church's esteem for marriage and celibacy \"does not require the exclusion of people who responsibly live out love, faithfulness, and mutual care in same-sex partnerships or in a remarriage after divorce.\"<ref name=\"CLEOQ\" />\n\n==Transgender issues==\nResponding to a document published by the [[United States Department of Education]] regarding transgender students, the bishops of the United States said that \"children, youth, and parents in these difficult situations deserve compassion, sensitivity, and respect.\"<ref name=\"clarity\" />  However, they criticized the document for \"infringing on legitimate concerns about privacy and security on the part of the other young students and parents\" when allowing transgender students to use facilities designated for the gender with which they identify.<ref name=\"clarity\" />   The bishops said the government did \"not even attempt to achieve this balance\" and pointed [[Amoris Laetitia|to the words]] of [[Pope Francis]]: \"the young need to be helped to accept their own body as it was created.\"<ref name=\"clarity\" />\n\nThe bishops of England and Wales had concerns about a proposed 2017 law that would affect transgender youths in schools, and wanted to \"ensure that there is no bullying of any sort.\"<ref name=\"Sherrington\" /> The Catholic Parliamentary Office in Scotland opposed allowing children as young as 16 to legally change their gender.<ref name=\"scottish\" />\n\n==Diplomatic disagreements==\nIn January 2015, the French government announced that it was proposing Laurent Stefanini as its [[ambassador]] to the Holy See. Stefanini was chief of protocol for President [[Fran\u00e7ois Hollande]] and had served as France's Head of Mission to the Vatican from 2001 to 2005. Cardinal [[Andr\u00e9 Vingt-Trois]], Archbishop of Paris, sent a letter to Pope Francis in support of Stefanini,<ref name=\"haw2I\" /> a practicing Roman Catholic who is reported to be gay, but has not spoken publicly of his sexuality, nor entered into a legal same-sex relationship. He publicly supported the legalization of same-sex marriage in France in 2013.<ref name=\"K8opB\" /> The Pope met with Stefanini for forty minutes on 17 April.<ref name=\"mitQn\" /> By October the Vatican had neither accepted nor rejected the appointment, and press speculation blamed either Stefanini's sexual orientation, France's recent legalization of same-sex marriage, or Vatican displeasure with the fact that the nomination was leaked for political reasons.<ref name=\"JJyJg\" /><ref name=\"JbQzm\" /> France named Stefanini its ambassador to [[UNESCO]] in April 2016.<ref name=\"P7aK5\" />\n\n==See also==\n*[[Catholic teaching on homosexuality]]\n*[[History of the Catholic Church and homosexuality]]\n*[[Pastoral care for gay Catholics]]\n*[[Dissent from Catholic teaching on homosexuality]]\n*[[Homosexuality and Roman Catholic priests]]\n*[[Gay bishops]]\n*[[List of LGBT Catholics]]\n*[[Alfredo Ormando]]\n*[[Christianity and transgender people]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"abroad\">{{cite news|last=Dias|first=Elizabeth|title=Gays Abroad Have Most to Gain from Pope Francis' Latest Comments |url=http://swampland.time.com/2013/07/31/gays-abroad-have-most-to-gain-from-pope-francis-latest-comments/|accessdate=24 August 2013|newspaper=Time Swampland|date=31 July 2013}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"allen\">John J.

Catholicism}}\n{{broader|Catholic Church and homosexuality}}\n\nThe '''political activity of the Catholic Church on LGBT issues''' consists of efforts made by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] to support or oppose civil government legislation on the basis of [[Catholic moral theology]] and [[Catholic Social Teaching]] surrounding issues of importance to [[LGBT]] people.  The Church generally condemns all forms of violence against gay and lesbian people and all criminal penalties against them. However, the Church in certain countries has on occasion actively resisted efforts to decriminalize homosexuality or to introduce measures to tackle discrimination. The Catholic Church also supports legally defining marriage in civil legislation as the union of one man and one woman, therefore generally opposing efforts to introduce gay [[civil unions]] and [[gay marriage]] \u2013 although some clergymen have expressed support for same-sex unions. The Church teaches that not all discrimination is \"unjust,\" and that sometimes the rights of individuals, including gay men and women, can be limited.

Many [[hadith]]s, including [[Muwatta Imam Malik]] from one of the [[Kutub al-Sittah]], talk about angels being repelled by humans' state of impurity.<ref>Burge, S. R. \u201cImpurity / Danger!\u201d Islamic Law and Society, vol. 17, no. 3-4, 2010, pp. 320\u2013349. JSTOR, https://www.jstor.org/stable/23034917.p. 323</ref> Such angels keep a distance from humans, who polluted themselves by certain actions (such as sexual intercourse). However, angels might return to an individual as soon as the person (ritually) purified himself or herself. The absence of angels may cause several problems for the person. If driven away by ritual impurity, the [[Kiraman Katibin]], who record people's actions,<ref>Burge, S. R. \u201cImpurity / Danger!\u201d Islamic Law and Society, vol. 17, no. 3-4, 2010, pp. 320\u2013349.

R. \u201cImpurity / Danger!\u201d Islamic Law and Society, vol. 17, no. 3-4, 2010, pp. 320\u2013349. JSTOR, https://www.jstor.org/stable/23034917.p. 327</ref> will not perform their tasks assigned to the individual. Another hadith specifies, during the state of impurity, bad actions are still written down, but good actions are not. When a person tells a lie, angels nearly are separated from the person from the stench it emanates.<ref>Burge, S. R. \u201cImpurity / Danger!\u201d Islamic Law and Society, vol. 17, no. 3-4, 2010, pp. 320\u2013349. JSTOR, https://www.jstor.org/stable/23034917.328</ref> Angels also depart from humans when they are naked or are having a bath out of decency, but also curse people who are nude in public.\n\n== Abstract angels ==\n=== Philosophy ===\nIn Islamic philosophy, angels appear frequently as incorporeal creatures. [[Al-Kindi]] and [[Ibn Sina]] both define angels as simple substances, which means, they belong to the [[Celestial spheres]] comparable to [[Ptolemaic astronomy]], endowed with life, reason, and immortality, in contrast to sublunary entities such as humans and animals, who are endowed with life, and the former also with reason, but are mortal.<ref>Seyyed Hossein Nasr ''An Introduction to Islamic Cosmological Doctrines'' SUNY Press, 01.01.1993 {{ISBN|9780791415153}} p. 236</ref><ref>Syrinx von Hees Enzyklop\u00e4die als Spiegel des Weltbildes: Qazw\u012bn\u012bs Wunder der Sch\u00f6pfung: eine Naturkunde des 13. Jahrhunderts Otto Harrassowitz Verlag 2002 {{ISBN|978-3-447-04511-7}} page 268 (German)</ref> Similar Qazwini assigns the angels to heavenly spheres, distinguishing them from among the animals, although both are said to possess the attribute of life. Significantly, [[Al-Damiri]] includes in his [[zoology|zoological]] works, animals, humans, [[jinn]] and even demons, but not angels.<ref>Houtsma, M. Th. (1993). E.J. Brill's First Encyclopaedia of Islam, 1913-1936, Band 5. BRILL. p. 191. {{ISBN|978-9-004-09791-9}} p. 192</ref> Such cosmological thought, maintained by scholars such as [[Al-Farabi]] and Ibn Sina, has strong resemblance with the [[Neoplatonism|Neo-Platonistic]] [[Emanationism|emanation cosmology]], identifying the different angels in Islam with [[Nous|intellects]], dividing the cosmos into different spheres. However, Islamic scholars repeatedly insist that all heavenly spheres as a whole form a single body and are moved by God, in contrast to Aristotelian cosmology in which God only moves the outer sphere.<ref>Seyyed Hossein Nasr ''An Introduction to Islamic Cosmological Doctrines'' SUNY Press, 01.01.1993 {{ISBN|9780791415153}} p. 236</ref> According to ibn Sina, but differing from Al-Farabi, God is not part of the scheme of emanation. God emanated things in accordance with his will. In his ''Theologia Aristotelis'' he shows that through the manifestation of God, the intellects are aware of God and their role in the universe. Further Ibn Sina seems to distinguishes between two types of angels: One completely unrelated to matter, and another one, which exists in form of a superior kind of matter. The latter ones can carry messages between the heavenly spheres and the sublunary world, appearing in visions. Therefore, the higher angels dwell in [[Jabarut|higher spheres]], while their subordinate angels appear in an [[Malakut|intermediary realm]]. Ibn Sina's explanation might imply an attempt to consider revelation as part of the natural world.<ref name=\"glasse 49 50\">Cyril Glass\u00e9, Huston Smith, The New Encyclopedia of Islam Rowman Altamira 2003 {{ISBN|978-0-759-10190-6}} page 49-50</ref><ref>Abd Al-Jabbar, Ibn Sina and Al-Ghazali ''God and Humans in Islamic Thought'' Routledge 2006 {{ISBN|9780203965375}}  p. 97</ref> Also Qazwini lists a lower type of angels; earthly angels as indwelling forces of nature, who keep the world in order and never deviate from their duty. Qazwini believed that the existence of these angels could be proved by reason and effects of these angels on their assigned object.<ref>Syrinx von Hees Enzyklop\u00e4die als Spiegel des Weltbildes: Qazw\u012bn\u012bs Wunder der Sch\u00f6pfung: eine Naturkunde des 13.

[[Al-Kindi]] and [[Ibn Sina]] both define angels as simple substances, which means, they belong to the [[Celestial spheres]] comparable to [[Ptolemaic astronomy]], endowed with life, reason, and immortality, in contrast to sublunary entities such as humans and animals, who are endowed with life, and the former also with reason, but are mortal.<ref>Seyyed Hossein Nasr ''An Introduction to Islamic Cosmological Doctrines'' SUNY Press, 01.01.1993 {{ISBN|9780791415153}} p. 236</ref><ref>Syrinx von Hees Enzyklop\u00e4die als Spiegel des Weltbildes: Qazw\u012bn\u012bs Wunder der Sch\u00f6pfung: eine Naturkunde des 13. Jahrhunderts Otto Harrassowitz Verlag 2002 {{ISBN|978-3-447-04511-7}} page 268 (German)</ref> Similar Qazwini assigns the angels to heavenly spheres, distinguishing them from among the animals, although both are said to possess the attribute of life. Significantly, [[Al-Damiri]] includes in his [[zoology|zoological]] works, animals, humans, [[jinn]] and even demons, but not angels.<ref>Houtsma, M. Th. (1993). E.J. Brill's First Encyclopaedia of Islam, 1913-1936, Band 5. BRILL. p. 191. {{ISBN|978-9-004-09791-9}} p. 192</ref> Such cosmological thought, maintained by scholars such as [[Al-Farabi]] and Ibn Sina, has strong resemblance with the [[Neoplatonism|Neo-Platonistic]] [[Emanationism|emanation cosmology]], identifying the different angels in Islam with [[Nous|intellects]], dividing the cosmos into different spheres. However, Islamic scholars repeatedly insist that all heavenly spheres as a whole form a single body and are moved by God, in contrast to Aristotelian cosmology in which God only moves the outer sphere.<ref>Seyyed Hossein Nasr ''An Introduction to Islamic Cosmological Doctrines'' SUNY Press, 01.01.1993 {{ISBN|9780791415153}} p. 236</ref> According to ibn Sina, but differing from Al-Farabi, God is not part of the scheme of emanation. God emanated things in accordance with his will. In his ''Theologia Aristotelis'' he shows that through the manifestation of God, the intellects are aware of God and their role in the universe. Further Ibn Sina seems to distinguishes between two types of angels: One completely unrelated to matter, and another one, which exists in form of a superior kind of matter. The latter ones can carry messages between the heavenly spheres and the sublunary world, appearing in visions. Therefore, the higher angels dwell in [[Jabarut|higher spheres]], while their subordinate angels appear in an [[Malakut|intermediary realm]]. Ibn Sina's explanation might imply an attempt to consider revelation as part of the natural world.<ref name=\"glasse 49 50\">Cyril Glass\u00e9, Huston Smith, The New Encyclopedia of Islam Rowman Altamira 2003 {{ISBN|978-0-759-10190-6}} page 49-50</ref><ref>Abd Al-Jabbar, Ibn Sina and Al-Ghazali ''God and Humans in Islamic Thought'' Routledge 2006 {{ISBN|9780203965375}}  p. 97</ref> Also Qazwini lists a lower type of angels; earthly angels as indwelling forces of nature, who keep the world in order and never deviate from their duty. Qazwini believed that the existence of these angels could be proved by reason and effects of these angels on their assigned object.<ref>Syrinx von Hees Enzyklop\u00e4die als Spiegel des Weltbildes: Qazw\u012bn\u012bs Wunder der Sch\u00f6pfung: eine Naturkunde des 13.
