The Western Addition is usually divided into smaller neighborhoods including [[Hayes Valley, San Francisco|Hayes Valley]], [[Fillmore District, San Francisco|the Fillmore]], and [[Japantown, San Francisco|Japantown]], which was once the largest Japantown in North America but suffered when its [[Japanese American]] residents were [[Japanese American internment|forcibly removed and interned]] during World War II. The Western Addition survived the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|1906 earthquake]] with its [[Victorian house|Victorians]] largely intact, including the famous \"[[Painted Ladies]]\", standing alongside [[Alamo Square]]. To the south, near the geographic center of the city is [[Haight-Ashbury]], famously associated with 1960s [[hippie]] culture.

In the 1910s, a wave of Central American immigrants settled in the Mission and, in the 1950s, immigrants from [[Mexican American|Mexico]] began to predominate.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.qualityoflife-themovie.com/website/mission.html |title=Quality of Life (film website) |work=Mission District History |author=Morgan, Benjamin (Director) |year=2007 |accessdate=July 25, 2010}}</ref> In recent years, gentrification has changed the demographics of parts of the Mission from Latino, to [[Twentysomething (term)|twenty-something]] professionals.

The predominantly African American [[Bayview\u2013Hunters Point, San Francisco|Bayview-Hunters Point]] in the far southeast corner of the city is one of the poorest neighborhoods and suffers from a high rate of crime, though the area has been the focus of several revitalizing and controversial [[urban renewal]] projects.\n\nThe construction of the [[Twin Peaks Tunnel]] in 1918 connected southwest neighborhoods to downtown via streetcar, hastening the development of [[West Portal, San Francisco|West Portal]], and nearby affluent [[Forest Hill, San Francisco|Forest Hill]] and [[St. Francis Wood, San Francisco|St. Francis Wood]]. Further west, stretching all the way to the Pacific Ocean and north to [[Golden Gate Park]] lies the vast [[Sunset District, San Francisco|Sunset District]], a large middle class area with a predominantly Asian population.<ref>{{cite news\n|last = Chow |first = Andrew\n|title = Dismal APA Turnout at First Redistricting Meetings\n|work=Asian Week\n|date = March 22, 2002\n}}</ref>\nThe northwestern quadrant of the city contains the [[Richmond District, San Francisco|Richmond]], also a mostly middle-class neighborhood north of Golden Gate Park, home to immigrants from other parts of Asia as well as many [[Russian people|Russian]] and [[Ukrainian people|Ukrainian]] immigrants. Together, these areas are known as [[Neighborhoods in San Francisco|The Avenues]]. These two districts are each sometimes further divided into two regions: the Outer Richmond and Outer Sunset can refer to the more western portions of their respective district and the Inner Richmond and Inner Sunset can refer to the more eastern portions.\n\nMany piers remained derelict for years until the demolition of the [[Embarcadero Freeway]] reopened the downtown waterfront, allowing for redevelopment.

As a result, the year's warmest month, on average, is September, and on average, October is warmer than July, especially in daytime.\n\nBecause of its sharp topography and maritime influences, San Francisco exhibits a multitude of distinct [[microclimate]]s. The high hills in the geographic center of the city are responsible for a 20% variance in annual rainfall between different parts of the city. They also protect neighborhoods directly to their east from the foggy and sometimes very cold and windy conditions experienced in the [[Sunset District, San Francisco|Sunset District]]; for those who live on the eastern side of the city, San Francisco is sunnier, with an average of 260 clear days, and only 105 cloudy days per year.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nTemperatures reach or exceed {{convert|80|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} on an average of only 21 and 23&nbsp;days a year at downtown and [[San Francisco International Airport]] (SFO), respectively.<ref name=\"San Francisco NOAA\"/> The dry period of May to October is mild to warm, with the normal monthly mean temperature peaking in September at {{convert|62.7|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"San Francisco NOAA\"/> The rainy period of November to April is slightly cooler, with the normal monthly mean temperature reaching its lowest in January at {{convert|51.3|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"San Francisco NOAA\"/> On average, there are 73 rainy days a year, and annual precipitation averages {{convert|23.65|in|mm|0}}.<ref name=\"San Francisco NOAA\"/> Variation in precipitation from year to year is high.

It was first named La Vega de Espinosa and known as ''el pueblo de los \u00d1angotaos'' (the town of the squatters\", in reference to the ''j\u00edbaros'' country folk who would wait for the train in a [[squatting position]], due to lack of benches). Before this, it was part of a group of towns known as Las Vegas. It was then that one area was named [[Vega Baja]] and the other Vega Alta.\n\nOn October 12, 1898 the city's mayor, Francisco Vega, received U.S. troops as part of the [[Spanish\u2013American War]].

It was first named La Vega de Espinosa and known as ''el pueblo de los \u00d1angotaos'' (the town of the squatters\", in reference to the ''j\u00edbaros'' country folk who would wait for the train in a [[squatting position]], due to lack of benches). Before this, it was part of a group of towns known as Las Vegas. It was then that one area was named [[Vega Baja]] and the other Vega Alta.\n\nOn October 12, 1898 the city's mayor, Francisco Vega, received U.S. troops as part of the [[Spanish\u2013American War]]. On that same day, for the first time in Vega Alta's history, the [[U.S. flag]] was lifted on city hall. From 1902 to 1905, Vega Alta became once more part of the neighbor city of Vega Baja. In 1905, the government of Puerto Rico passed a law, allowing Vega Alta to become a municipality with its own limits.\n\nHacienda Carmen and Hacienda Ortega sugar plantations were owned by Juan Gualberto Landron y Martinez born in 1791 in Toa Baja . He owned slaves and purchased them,  some coming directly from Africa.\n\nThe second-largest mosque, built in 1992, is located in Vega Alta.<ref name=\"Arab News 2012\">{{cite web | title=Muslims in Puerto Rico | website=Arab News | date=December 28, 2012 | url=http://www.arabnews.com/muslims-puerto-rico | access-date=July 25, 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161001205228/http://www.arabnews.com/muslims-puerto-rico | archive-date=October 1, 2016 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nVega Alta is on the northern coast.<ref name=\"PR_Ency\">{{cite web|url=https://enciclopediapr.org/en/encyclopedia/vega-alta-municipality/|title=Vega Alta Municipality|publisher=Fundaci\u00f3n Puertorrique\u00f1a de las Humanidades (FPH)|website=enciclopediapr.org|access-date=2019-03-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190404130104/https://enciclopediapr.org/en/encyclopedia/vega-alta-municipality/|archive-date=2019-04-04|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[R\u00edo Cibuco]], [[R\u00edo Mavilla]] and [[R\u00edo Unib\u00f3n]] are located in Vega Alta.\nThe Javier Calder\u00f3n beach, better known as [[Cerro Gordo Beach]] is administered by the [[Puerto Rico Department of Sports and Recreation]].<ref name=\"Cerro Gordo\">{{cite web |title=Balneario Cerro Gordo |url=http://www.drdpuertorico.com/parquesnacionales/balnearios/balneario-cerro-gordo/ |website=drdpuertorico |language=es |publisher=Programa de Parques Nacionales de Puerto Rico |accessdate=13 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190213124016/http://www.drdpuertorico.com/parquesnacionales/balnearios/balneario-cerro-gordo/ |archive-date=13 February 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nVega Alta has a land area of 27.75 square miles (71.87&nbsp;km\u00b2) and water area of 9.76 square miles (25.28&nbsp;km\u00b2).<ref name=\"US2010Census\" />\n\n===Hurricane Maria===\n\n[[Hurricane Maria]] on September 20, 2017 triggered numerous landslides in Vega Alta with the significant amount of rainfall.<ref name=\"USGS_Maria_Landslides\">{{cite web |title=Preliminary Locations of Landslide Impacts from Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico |url=https://landslides.usgs.gov/research/featured/2017/maria-pr/ |website=USGS Landslide Hazards Program |publisher=USGS |access-date=2019-03-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190303143147/https://landslides.usgs.gov/research/featured/2017/maria-pr/ |archive-date=2019-03-03 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"USGS_Maria_Landslides map\">{{cite web |title=Preliminary Locations of Landslide Impacts from Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico |url=https://landslides.usgs.gov/research/featured/2017/maria-pr/images/PR_Maria_LS_density_map.pdf |website=USGS Landslide Hazards Program |publisher=USGS |access-date=2019-03-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190303143147/https://landslides.usgs.gov/research/featured/2017/maria-pr/images/PR_Maria_LS_density_map.pdf |archive-date=2019-03-03 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Barrios===\n[[File:Vega Alta, Puerto Rico locator map.png|thumb|Subdivisions of Vega Alta.]]\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Vega Alta is subdivided into [[Barrios of Puerto Rico|barrios]].

''Environmental hygiene'' addresses similar issues to ''occupational hygiene'' but is likely to be about broad industry or broad issues affecting the local community, broader society, region or country.\n\nThe profession of '''occupational hygiene''' uses strict and rigorous scientific methodology and often requires professional judgment based on experience and education in determining the potential for hazardous exposure risks in workplace and environmental studies.  These aspects of occupational hygiene can often be referred to as the \"art\" of occupational hygiene and is used in a similar sense to the \"art\" of [[medicine]]. In fact \"occupational hygiene\" is both an aspect of [[preventive medicine]] and in particular [[occupational medicine]], in that its goal is to prevent industrial disease, using the science of [[risk management]], [[exposure assessment]] and [[industrial safety]].  Ultimately professionals seek to implement \"safe\" systems, procedures or methods to be applied in the workplace or to the environment.\n\n==The social role of occupational hygiene==\nOccupational hygienists have been involved historically with changing the perception of society about the nature and extent of hazards and preventing exposures in the workplace and communities.  Many occupational hygienists work day-to-day with industrial situations that require control or improvement to the workplace situation. However larger social issues affecting whole industries have occurred in the past e.g. since 1900, [[asbestos]] exposures that have affected the lives of tens of thousands of people.  Occupational hygienists have become more engaged in understanding and managing exposure risks to consumers from products with regulations such as REACh ([[Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals]]) enacted in 2006.\n\nMore recent issues affecting broader society are, for example in 1976, Legionnaires' disease or [[legionellosis]]. More recently again in the 1990s, [[radon]], and in the 2000s, the effects of [[Mold (fungus)|mold]] from indoor air quality situations in the home and at work.  In the later part of the 2000s, concern has been raised about the health effects of [[Nanoparticle|nanoparticles]].\n\nMany of these issues have required the coordination over a number of years of a number of medical and paraprofessionals in detecting and then characterizing the nature of the issue, both in terms of the hazard and in terms of the risk to the workplace and ultimately to society.  This has involved occupational hygienists in research, collection of data and to develop suitable and satisfactory control methodologies.\n\n==General activities==\nThe occupational hygienist may be involved with the assessment and control of [[Physical hazard|physical]], [[Chemical hazard|chemical]], [[biological]] or [[Environmental hazard|environmental]] hazards in the workplace or community that could cause [[injury]] or [[disease]].  Physical hazards may include [[Noise health effects|noise]], [[Temperature extreme|temperature extremes]], [[Over-illumination|illumination extremes]], [[Ionizing radiation|ionizing]] or [[Non-ionising radiation|non-ionizing]] [[radiation]], and [[ergonomics]].  Chemical hazards related to dangerous goods or hazardous substances are frequently investigated by occupational hygienists.  Other related areas including [[indoor air quality]] (IAQ) and [[safety]] may also receive the attention of the occupational hygienist.  Biological hazards may stem from the potential for legionella exposure at work or the investigation of biological injury or effects at work, such as dermatitis may be investigated.\n\nAs part of the investigation process, the occupational hygienist may be called upon to communicate effectively regarding the nature of the hazard, the potential for risk, and the appropriate methods of control.  Appropriate controls are selected from the [[Hierarchy of hazard control|hierarchy of control]]: by elimination, substitution, engineering, administration and personal protective equipment (PPE) to control the hazard or eliminate the risk.  Such controls may involve recommendations as simple as appropriate PPE such as a 'basic' particulate dust mask to occasionally designing dust extraction ventilation systems, work places or management systems to manage people and programs for the preservation of health and well-being of those who enter a workplace.\n\nExamples of occupational hygiene include:\n[[File:Disposable_foam_earplugs.jpg|thumb|270x270px|Disposable foam earplugs: out of the ear with coins for scale (top) and inserted into the wearer's ear (bottom).]]\n* Analysis of physical hazards such as noise, which may require the use hearing protection [[earplugs]] and/or [[earmuffs]] to prevent hearing loss.\n* Developing plans and procedures to protect against infectious disease exposure in the event of a [[flu pandemic]].\n* Monitoring the air for hazardous contaminants which may potentially lead to worker illness or death.\n\n==Workplace assessment methods==\nAlthough there are many aspects to occupational hygiene work the most known and sought after is in determining or estimating potential or actual [[Exposure assessment|exposures]] to hazards.  For many chemicals and physical hazards, [[occupational exposure limits]] have been derived using toxicological, epidemiological and medical data allowing hygienists to reduce the risks of health effects by implementing the \"Hierarchy of Hazard Controls\".  Several methods can be applied in assessing the workplace or environment for exposure to a known or suspected hazard.  Occupational hygienists do not rely on the accuracy of the equipment or method used but in knowing with certainty and precision the limits of the equipment or method being used and the error or variance given by using that particular equipment or method.  Well known methods for performing occupational exposure assessments can be found in \"A Strategy for Assessing and Managing Occupational Exposures, Third Edition Edited by Joselito S. Ignacio and William H. Bullock\".<ref>\"A Strategy for Assessing and Managing Occupational Exposures, Third Edition Edited by Joselito S. Ignacio and William H.

A traditional method applied by occupational hygienists to initially survey a workplace or environment is used to determine both the types and possible exposures from hazards (e.g. noise, chemicals, radiation).  The '''walk-through survey''' can be targeted or limited to particular hazards such as silica dust, or noise, to focus attention on control of all hazards to workers.   A full walk-through survey is frequently used to provide information on establishing a framework for future investigations, prioritizing hazards, determining the requirements for measurement and establishing some immediate control of potential exposures. The [[Health Hazard Evaluation Program]] from the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] is an example of an industrial hygiene walk-through survey. Other sources of basic characterization information include worker interviews, observing exposure tasks, material safety data sheets, workforce scheduling, production data, equipment and maintenance schedules to identify potential exposure agents and people possibly exposed.\n\nThe information that needs to be gathered from sources should apply to the specific type of work from which the hazards can come from. As mentioned previously, examples of these sources include interviews with people who have worked in the field of the hazard, history and analysis of past incidents, and official reports of work and the hazards encountered. Of these, the personnel interviews may be the most critical in identifying undocumented practices, events, releases, hazards and other relevant information. Once the information is gathered from a collection of sources, it is recommended for these to be digitally archived (to allow for quick searching) and to have a physical set of the same information in order for it to be more accessible. One innovative way to display the complex historical hazard information is with a historical hazards identification map, which distills the hazard information into an easy to use graphical format.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dndkm.org/DOEKMDocuments/BestPractices/20-Historical+Hazard+Identification+Process+for+DandD.pdf|title=D&D KM-IT - Deactivation & Decommissioning powered by the global community!|first=FIU ARC, DOE|last=EM|date=|website=www.dndkm.org}}</ref>\n\n===Sampling===\n[[File:US_Navy_061026-N-7981E-019_Lt._Cmdr._Paul_Treadway,_Industrial_Hygiene_Officer_and_Assistant_Safety_Officer_of_the_Nimitz-class_aircraft_carrier_USS_Abraham_Lincoln_(CVN_72),_uses_a_sound_level_meter_to_demonstrate_the_high_deci.jpg|right|thumb|Measurements of noise levels using a sound level meter is a component of the occupational hygiene assessment.]]An occupational hygienist may use one or a number of commercially available electronic measuring devices to measure noise, vibration, ionizing and non-ionizing radiation, dust, solvents, gases, and so on.  Each device is often specifically designed to measure a specific or particular type of contaminant.  Electronic devices need to be calibrated before and after use to ensure the accuracy of the measurements taken and often require a system of certifying the precision of the instrument.\n\nCollecting occupational exposure data is resource- and time-intensive, and can be used for different purposes, including evaluating compliance with government regulations and for planning preventive interventions.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=G\u00f3mez|first=Manuel R.|last2=Rawls|first2=Greg|date=1995-04-01|title=Conference on Occupational Exposure Databases: A Report and Look at the Future|journal=Applied Occupational and Environmental Hygiene|volume=10|issue=4|pages=238\u2013243|doi=10.1080/1047322X.1995.10389030|issn=1047-322X}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=LaMontagne|first=Anthony D.|last2=Herrick|first2=Robert F.|last3=Dyke|first3=Michael V.

'''Inhalable''' dust is determined using the modern equivalent of the [[Institute of Occupational Medicine]] (IOM) MRE 113A monitor (see section on workplace exposure, measurement & modelling).  Inhalable dust is considered to be dust of less than 100 micrometers aerodynamic equivalent diameter (AED) that enters through the nose and or mouth.  See [[Lungs]]\n\n'''Respirable''' dust is sampled using a cyclone dust sampler design to sample for a specific fraction of dust AED at a set flow rate.  The respirable dust fraction is dust that enters the 'deep lung' and is considered to be less than 10 micrometers AED.\n\nNuisance, inhalable and respirable dust fractions are all sampled using a constant volumetric pump for a specific sampling period.  By knowing the mass of the sample collected and the volume of air sampled, a concentration for the fraction sampled can be given in milligrams (mg) per metre cubed (m<sup>3</sup>).  From such samples, the amount of inhalable or respirable dust can be determined and compared to the relevant [[Occupational exposure limit|occupational exposure limits]].\n\nBy use of inhalable, respirable or other suitable sampler (7 hole, 5 hole, et cetera), these dust sampling methods can also used to determine metal exposure in the air.  This requires collection of the sample on a methyl-cellulose ester (MCE) filter and acid digestion of the collection media in the laboratory followed by measuring metal concentration though an atomic absorption (or emission) spectrophotometry.  Both the UK Health and Safety Laboratory <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hsl.gov.uk/publications/mdhs.html|title=Health and Safety Laboratory|website=hsl.gov.uk|access-date=2009-05-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090616185829/http://www.hsl.gov.uk/publications/mdhs.html|archive-date=2009-06-16|url-status=dead}}</ref> and NIOSH Manual of Analytical Methods <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/nmam/|title=CDC - NIOSH Publications and Products - NIOSH Manual of Analytical Methods (2003-154) -|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-04-07}}</ref> have specific methodologies for a broad range of metals in air found in industrial processing (smelting, foundries, et cetera).\n\nA further method exists for the determination of asbestos, fibreglass, synthetic mineral fibre and ceramic mineral fibre dust in air.  This is the membrane filter method (MFM) and requires the collection of the dust on a grided filter for estimation of exposure by the counting of 'conforming' fibres in 100 fields through a microscope.  Results are quantified on the basis of number of fibres per millilitre of air (f/ml).  Many countries strictly regulate the methodology applied to the MFM.\n\n====Chemical sampling====\nTwo types of chemically absorbent tubes are used to sample for a wide range of chemical substances.  Traditionally a chemical absorbent 'tube' (a glass or stainless steel tube of between 2 and 10&nbsp;mm internal diameter) filled with very fine absorbent silica (hydrophilic) or carbon, such as coconut charcoal (lypophylic), is used in a sampling line where air is drawn through the absorbent material for between four hours (minimum workplace sample) to 24 hours (environmental sample) period.  The hydrophilic material readily absorbs water-soluble chemical and the lypophylic material absorbs non water-soluble materials.  The absorbent material is then chemically or physically extracted and measurements performed using various gas chromatograph or mass spectrometry methods.  These absorbent tube methods have the advantage of being usable for a wide range of potential contaminates.  However, they are relatively expensive methods, are time consuming and require significant expertise in sampling and chemical analysis.  A frequent complaint of workers is in having to wear the sampling pump (up to 1&nbsp;kg) for several days of work to provide adequate data for the required statistical certainty determination of the exposure.\n\nIn the last few decades, advances have been made in 'passive' badge technology.  These samplers can now be purchased to measure one chemical (e.g. formaldehyde) or a chemical type (e.g. ketones) or a broad spectrum of chemicals (e.g. solvents).  They are relatively easy to set up and use.  However, considerable cost can still be incurred in analysis of the 'badge'.  They weigh 20 to 30&nbsp;grams and workers do not complain about their presence.  Unfortunately 'badges' may not exist for all types of workplace sampling that may be required, and the charcoal or silica method may sometimes have to be applied.\n\nFrom the sampling method, results are expressed in milligrams per cubic meter (mg/m<sup>3</sup>) or parts per million (PPM) and compared to the relevant [[Occupational exposure limit|occupational exposure limits]].\n\nIt is a critical part of the exposure determination that the method of sampling for the specific contaminate exposure is directly linked to the exposure standard used.  Many countries regulate both the exposure standard, the method used to determine the exposure and the methods to be used for chemical or other analysis of the samples collected.\n[[File:Hierarchies_of_Exposure_Assessment_and_Management.JPG|thumb|Simple representation of exposure risk assessment and management hierarchy based on available information]]\n\n===Exposure management and controls===\nThe [[hierarchy of control]] defines the approach used to reduce exposure risks protecting workers and communities.  These methods include [[Hazard elimination|elimination]], [[Hazard substitution|substitution]], [[engineering controls]] (isolation or ventilation), [[administrative controls]] and [[personal protective equipment]].  Occupational hygienists, engineers, maintenance, management and employees should all be consulted for selecting and designing the most effective and efficient controls based on the hierarchy of control.\n\n==Professional societies==\nThe development of industrial hygiene societies originated in the United States, beginning with the first convening of members for the [[American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists]] in 1938, and the formation of the [[American Industrial Hygiene Association]] in 1939. In the United Kingdom, the [[British Occupational Hygiene Society]] started in 1953.

There is an \"art\" to applying the technical principles in a manner that provides a reasonable solution for workplace and environmental issues.  In effect an experienced \"mentor\", who has experience in occupational hygiene is required to show a new occupational hygienist how to apply the learned scientific and management knowledge in the workplace and to the environment issue to satisfactorily resolve the problem.\n\nTo be a professional occupational hygienist, experience in as wide a practice as possible is required to demonstrate knowledge in areas of occupational hygiene.  This is difficult for \"specialists\" or those who practice in narrow subject areas.  Limiting experience to individual subject like asbestos remediation, confined spaces, indoor air quality, or lead abatement, or learning only through a textbook or \u201creview course\u201d can be a disadvantage when required to demonstrate competence in other areas of occupational hygiene.\n\nInformation presented in Wikipedia can be considered to be only an outline of the requirements for professional occupational hygiene training.  This is because the actual requirements in any country, state or region may vary due to educational resources available, industry demand or regulatory mandated requirements.\n\nDuring 2010, the Occupational Hygiene Training Association (OHTA) through sponsorship provided by the IOHA initiated a training scheme for those with an interest in or those requiring training in occupational hygiene. These training modules can be downloaded and used freely. The available subject modules (Basic Principles in Occupational Hygiene, Health Effects of Hazardous Substances, Measurement of Hazardous Substances, Thermal Environment, Noise, Asbestos, Control, Ergonomics) are aimed at the \u2018foundation\u2019 and \u2018intermediate\u2019 levels in Occupational Hygiene. Although the modules can be used freely without supervision, attendance at an accredited training course is encouraged. These training modules are available from [http://www.ohlearning.com/ OH Learning.com]\n\nAcademic programs offering industrial hygiene bachelor's or master's degrees in United States may apply to the [[Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology]] (ABET) to have their program accredited.  As of October 1, 2006, 27 institutions have accredited their industrial hygiene programs.  Accreditation is not available for Doctoral programs.\n\nIn the U.S., the training of IH professionals is supported by [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] through their [[NIOSH Education and Research Centers]].\n\n===Professional credentials===\n====Australia====\nIn 2005, the Australian Institute of Occupational Hygiene (AIOH) has accredited professional occupational hygienist through a certification scheme.  Occupational Hygienists in Australian certified through this scheme are entitled to use the phrase '''Certified Occupational Hygienist''' (COH) as part of their qualifications.\n\n====United States of America====\nPractitioners who successfully meet specific education and work-experience requirements and pass a written examination administered by the [http://www.abih.org/ American Board of Industrial Hygiene] (ABIH) are authorized to use the term '''Certified Industrial Hygienist''' (CIH) or '''Certified Associate Industrial Hygienist''' (CAIH).  Both of these terms have been codified into law in many states in the United States to identify minimum qualifications of individuals having oversight over certain activities that may affect employee and general public health.\n\nAfter the initial certification, the CIH or CAIH maintains their certification by meeting on-going requirements for ethical behavior, education, and professional activities (e.g., active practice, technical committees, publishing, teaching).\n\nABIH certification examinations are offered during a spring and fall testing window each year at more than 400 locations worldwide.\n\nThe CIH designation is the most well known and recognized industrial hygiene designation throughout the world. There are approximately 6800 CIHs in the world making ABIH the largest industrial hygiene certification organization. The CAIH certification program was discontinued in 2006.

People who are currently certified by the ABIH can be found in a [https://web.archive.org/web/20110713093558/http://www.abih.org/members/roster/rostersearch.cfm public roster].\n\nThe ABIH is a recognized certification board by the International Occupational Hygiene Association (IOHA). The CIH certification has been accredited internationally by the International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC 17024) (see ANSI). In the United States, the CIH has been accredited by the Council of Engineering and Scientific Specialty Boards [CESB].\n\nThe Association of Professional Industrial Hygienists, Inc. (APIH) was established in 1994 to offer credentialing to industrial hygienists who meet the education and experience requirements found in Tennessee Code Annotated, Title 62, Chapter 40.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://apih.us/|title=Association of Professional Industrial Hygienists|website=apih.us|access-date=2016-04-07}}</ref> APIH adopted the Tennessee Code as its basis for credentialing because it was the first legal definition in the United States of an industrial hygienist in terms of education and experience. The APIH Registration Committee investigates and verifies, through electronic means or correspondence, both educational and experience accomplishments claimed by each applicant for registration. The Committee determines the appropriate level of registration, '''Registered Industrial Hygienist''' or '''Registered Professional Industrial Hygienist''', and then authorizes the registration certificate to be issued.\n\n====Canada====\nIn Canada, a practitioner who successfully completes a written test and an interview administered by the [http://www.crboh.ca/ Canadian Registration Board of Occupational Hygienists] can be recognized as a '''Registered Occupational Hygienist''' (ROH) or '''Registered Occupational Hygiene Technician''' (ROHT).  There is also designation to be recognized as a '''Canadian Registered Safety Professional''' (CRSP).\n\n====United Kingdom====\nThe Faculty of Occupational Hygiene, part of the British Occupational Hygiene Society, represents the interests of professional occupational hygienists.\n\nMembership of the Faculty of Occupational Hygiene is confined to BOHS members who hold a recognized professional qualification in occupational hygiene.\n\nThere are three grades of Faculty membership:\n* Licentiate (LFOH) holders will have obtained the BOHS Certificate of Operational Competence in Occupational Hygiene and have at least three years\u2019 practical experience in the field.\n* Members (MFOH) are normally holders of the Diploma of Professional Competence in Occupational Hygiene and have at least five years\u2019 experience at a senior level.\n* Fellows (FFOH) are senior members of the profession who have made a distinct contribution to the advancement of occupational hygiene.\n\nAll Faculty members participate in a Continuous Professional Development (CPD) scheme designed to maintain a high level of current awareness and knowledge in occupational hygiene.\n\n====India====\nThe Indian Society of Industrial hygiene was formed in 1981 at Chennai, India. Subsequently, its secretariat was shifted to Kanpur. The society has registered about 400 members, about 90 of whom are life members. The society publishes a newsletter, \"Industrial Hygiene Link\". The current address of the secretary of the society is Shyam Singh Gautam, Secretary, Indian Society of Industrial Hygiene, 11, Shakti Nagar, Rama Devi, Kanpur 2008005 Mobile number 8005187037.\n\n==See also==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n*{{annotated link|Astronautical hygiene}}\n*{{annotated link|Human factors and ergonomics}}\n*{{annotated link|Exposure assessment}}\n*{{annotated link|Indoor air quality}}\n*{{annotated link|Infection control}}\n*{{annotated link|Institute of Occupational Medicine}}\n*{{annotated link|Noise Control}}\n\n{{col-2}}\n*{{annotated link|Occupational exposure limit}}\n*{{annotated link|Occupational epidemiology}}\n*{{annotated link|Occupational safety and health }}\n*{{annotated link|Occupational health nursing}}\n*{{annotated link|Occupational Health Science|''Occupational Health Science''}}\n*{{annotated link|Occupational therapy}}\n*{{annotated link|Toxicity}}\n*{{annotated link|Yant Award}}\n{{col-end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [http://www.who.int/occupational_health/publications/en/ World Health Organization Occupational Health Publications]\n* [http://www.ilocis.org/en/contilo.html International Labour Organization Encyclopaedia of Occupational Health and Safety], {{ISBN|92-2-109203-8}}[http://www.ilo.org/public/english/region/ampro/cinterfor/sid/servicio/encyclo/index.htm <nowiki>[1]</nowiki>]\n* [http://www.hse.gov.uk/infoserv/hseline.htm UK HSEline]\n* [http://www.epa.gov/iaq/largebldgs/i-beam/index.html EPA Indoor Air Quality on-line educator]\n* [http://www.ccohs.ca/topics/hazards/ Canada hazard information]\n* [http://www.ilpi.com/msds/index.html A list of MSDS sites] (Partly commercial)\n* [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/ (US) NIOSH Pocket Guide]\n* [http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/ (US) Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry]\n* [http://www.toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/ (US) National Library of Medicine Toxicology Data Network]\n* [http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ (US) National Toxicology Program]\n* [http://www.iarc.fr/ International Agency for Research on Cancer]\n* [http://ccinfoweb.ccohs.ca/rtecs/search.html RTECS] (by subscription only)\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100311082143/http://www.chemfinder.com/chembiofinder/Forms/Home/ContentArea/Home.aspx Chemfinder]\n* [http://www.inchem.org/ Inchem]\n* Many larger businesses maintain their own product and chemical information.\n* There are also many subscription services available (CHEMINFO, OSH, CHEMpendium, Chem Alert, Chemwatch, Infosafe, RightAnswer.com's TOMES Plus, OSH Update, OSH-ROM, et cetera).\n\n==External links==\n{{Commonscat|Industrial hygiene}}\n*[http://www.turnstoneehs.net/industrial-hygiene/hexavalent-chromium-national-emphasis-program.htm (OSHA) passed standards on exposure to hexavalent chromium - Hexavalent Chromium National Emphasis Program]\n*[https://www.acgih.org/ American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists] (ACGIH)\n*[https://www.aiha.org/Pages/default.aspx American Industrial Hygiene Association]\n*[http://www.labour.gov.hk/eng/public/oh/impurities.pdf Government of Hong Kong Occupational Safety and Health Council, Air Contaminants in the Workplace]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070404113424/http://www.aiha.org/1documents/students/IndustrialHygieneStudentPowerpointsmallversion.ppt View a PowerPoint Presentation Explaining What Industrial Hygiene Is - developed and made available by AIHA]\n*[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/nmam/ The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health Manual of Analytical Methods (NMAM)]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090616185829/http://www.hsl.gov.uk/publications/mdhs.html UK Health and Safety Executive, Health and Safety Laboratory, Methods for the Determination of Hazardous Substances (MDHS)]\n*[http://www.iso.org/iso/home.htm International Organization for Standardization (ISO)]\n*[http://www.ioha.net/ International Occupational Hygiene Association (IOHA)]\n\n{{Public health}}\n{{Occupational safety and health}}\n{{Aspects of occupations}}\n{{Underwater diving|divsaf}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Occupational Hygiene}}\n[[Category:Industrial hygiene| ]]\n[[Category:Occupational safety and health]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Management of workplace health hazards}}\n[[File:Exposure_Risk_Assessment_and_Management.JPG|thumb|Illustration of Exposure Risk Assessment and Management related to anticipation, recognition, evaluation, control and confirm.]]\n{{Occupational hazards}}\n'''Occupational hygiene''' (United States: '''industrial hygiene''' (IH)) is the [[Anticipate, recognize, evaluate, control, and confirm|anticipation, recognition, evaluation, control, and confirmation]] of protection from hazards at work that may result in injury, illness, or affect the well being of workers.

Depending on an individual's type of job, a hygienist will apply their exposure science expertise for the protection of workers, consumers and/or communities.\n\nThe British Occupational Hygiene Society (BOHS) defines that \"occupational hygiene is about the prevention of ill-health from work, through recognizing, evaluating and controlling the risks\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bohs.org/standardTemplate.aspx|title=British Occupational Hygiene Society (BOHS)|website=bohs.org|access-date=2010-03-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830051500/http://www.bohs.org/standardTemplate.aspx|archive-date=2009-08-30|url-status=dead}}</ref>  The International Occupational Hygiene Association (IOHA) refers to occupational hygiene as ''the discipline of anticipating, recognizing, evaluating and controlling [[health]] hazards in the working environment with the objective of protecting worker health and well-being and safeguarding the community at large.''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ioha.net|title=Home \u00bb IOHA - International Occupational Hygiene Association|website=IOHA - International Occupational Hygiene Association|access-date=2016-04-07}}</ref> The term \"occupational hygiene\" (used in the UK and Commonwealth countries as well as much of  Europe) is synonymous with ''industrial hygiene'' (used in the US, Latin America, and other countries that received initial technical support or training from US sources).  The term \"industrial hygiene\" traditionally stems from industries with construction, mining or manufacturing, and \"occupational hygiene\" refers to all types of industry such as those listed for \"industrial hygiene\" as well as financial and support services industries and refers to \"[[Employment|work]]\", \"[[wikt:Workplace|workplace]]\" and \"place of work\" in general.  ''Environmental hygiene'' addresses similar issues to ''occupational hygiene'' but is likely to be about broad industry or broad issues affecting the local community, broader society, region or country.\n\nThe profession of '''occupational hygiene''' uses strict and rigorous scientific methodology and often requires professional judgment based on experience and education in determining the potential for hazardous exposure risks in workplace and environmental studies.  These aspects of occupational hygiene can often be referred to as the \"art\" of occupational hygiene and is used in a similar sense to the \"art\" of [[medicine]]. In fact \"occupational hygiene\" is both an aspect of [[preventive medicine]] and in particular [[occupational medicine]], in that its goal is to prevent industrial disease, using the science of [[risk management]], [[exposure assessment]] and [[industrial safety]].  Ultimately professionals seek to implement \"safe\" systems, procedures or methods to be applied in the workplace or to the environment.\n\n==The social role of occupational hygiene==\nOccupational hygienists have been involved historically with changing the perception of society about the nature and extent of hazards and preventing exposures in the workplace and communities.  Many occupational hygienists work day-to-day with industrial situations that require control or improvement to the workplace situation. However larger social issues affecting whole industries have occurred in the past e.g. since 1900, [[asbestos]] exposures that have affected the lives of tens of thousands of people.  Occupational hygienists have become more engaged in understanding and managing exposure risks to consumers from products with regulations such as REACh ([[Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals]]) enacted in 2006.\n\nMore recent issues affecting broader society are, for example in 1976, Legionnaires' disease or [[legionellosis]]. More recently again in the 1990s, [[radon]], and in the 2000s, the effects of [[mold]] from indoor air quality situations in the home and at work.  In the later part of the 2000s, concern has been raised about the health effects of [[Nanoparticle|nanoparticles]].\n\nMany of these issues have required the coordination over a number of years of a number of medical and paraprofessionals in detecting and then characterizing the nature of the issue, both in terms of the hazard and in terms of the risk to the workplace and ultimately to society.  This has involved occupational hygienists in research, collection of data and to develop suitable and satisfactory control methodologies.\n\n==General activities==\nThe occupational hygienist may be involved with the assessment and control of [[Physical hazard|physical]], [[Chemical hazard|chemical]], [[biological]] or [[Environmental hazard|environmental]] hazards in the workplace or community that could cause [[injury]] or [[disease]].  Physical hazards may include [[Noise health effects|noise]], [[Temperature extreme|temperature extremes]], [[Over-illumination|illumination extremes]], [[Ionizing radiation|ionizing]] or [[Non-ionising radiation|non-ionizing]] [[radiation]], and [[ergonomics]].  Chemical hazards related to dangerous goods or hazardous substances are frequently investigated by occupational hygienists.  Other related areas including [[indoor air quality]] (IAQ) and [[safety]] may also receive the attention of the occupational hygienist.  Biological hazards may stem from the potential for legionella exposure at work or the investigation of biological injury or effects at work, such as dermatitis may be investigated.\n\nAs part of the investigation process, the occupational hygienist may be called upon to communicate effectively regarding the nature of the hazard, the potential for risk, and the appropriate methods of control.  Appropriate controls are selected from the [[Hierarchy of hazard control|hierarchy of control]]: by elimination, substitution, engineering, administration and personal protective equipment (PPE) to control the hazard or eliminate the risk.  Such controls may involve recommendations as simple as appropriate PPE such as a 'basic' particulate dust mask to occasionally designing dust extraction ventilation systems, work places or management systems to manage people and programs for the preservation of health and well-being of those who enter a workplace.\n\nExamples of occupational hygiene include:\n[[File:Disposable_foam_earplugs.jpg|thumb|270x270px|Disposable foam earplugs: out of the ear with coins for scale (top) and inserted into the wearer's ear (bottom).]]\n* Analysis of physical hazards such as noise, which may require the use hearing protection [[earplugs]] and/or [[earmuffs]] to prevent hearing loss.\n* Developing plans and procedures to protect against infectious disease exposure in the event of a [[flu pandemic]].\n* Monitoring the air for hazardous contaminants which may potentially lead to worker illness or death.\n\n==Workplace assessment methods==\nAlthough there are many aspects to occupational hygiene work the most known and sought after is in determining or estimating potential or actual [[Exposure assessment|exposures]] to hazards.  For many chemicals and physical hazards, [[occupational exposure limits]] have been derived using toxicological, epidemiological and medical data allowing hygienists to reduce the risks of health effects by implementing the \"Hierarchy of Hazard Controls\".  Several methods can be applied in assessing the workplace or environment for exposure to a known or suspected hazard.  Occupational hygienists do not rely on the accuracy of the equipment or method used but in knowing with certainty and precision the limits of the equipment or method being used and the error or variance given by using that particular equipment or method.  Well known methods for performing occupational exposure assessments can be found in \"A Strategy for Assessing and Managing Occupational Exposures, Third Edition Edited by Joselito S. Ignacio and William H. Bullock\".<ref>\"A Strategy for Assessing and Managing Occupational Exposures, Third Edition Edited by Joselito S. Ignacio and William H.

A traditional method applied by occupational hygienists to initially survey a workplace or environment is used to determine both the types and possible exposures from hazards (e.g. noise, chemicals, radiation).  The '''walk-through survey''' can be targeted or limited to particular hazards such as silica dust, or noise, to focus attention on control of all hazards to workers.   A full walk-through survey is frequently used to provide information on establishing a framework for future investigations, prioritizing hazards, determining the requirements for measurement and establishing some immediate control of potential exposures. The [[Health Hazard Evaluation Program]] from the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] is an example of an industrial hygiene walk-through survey. Other sources of basic characterization information include worker interviews, observing exposure tasks, material safety data sheets, workforce scheduling, production data, equipment and maintenance schedules to identify potential exposure agents and people possibly exposed.\n\nThe information that needs to be gathered from sources should apply to the specific type of work from which the hazards can come from. As mentioned previously, examples of these sources include interviews with people who have worked in the field of the hazard, history and analysis of past incidents, and official reports of work and the hazards encountered. Of these, the personnel interviews may be the most critical in identifying undocumented practices, events, releases, hazards and other relevant information. Once the information is gathered from a collection of sources, it is recommended for these to be digitally archived (to allow for quick searching) and to have a physical set of the same information in order for it to be more accessible. One innovative way to display the complex historical hazard information is with a historical hazards identification map, which distills the hazard information into an easy to use graphical format.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dndkm.org/DOEKMDocuments/BestPractices/20-Historical+Hazard+Identification+Process+for+DandD.pdf|title=D&D KM-IT - Deactivation & Decommissioning powered by the global community!|first=FIU ARC, DOE|last=EM|date=|website=www.dndkm.org}}</ref>\n\n===Sampling===\n[[File:US_Navy_061026-N-7981E-019_Lt._Cmdr._Paul_Treadway,_Industrial_Hygiene_Officer_and_Assistant_Safety_Officer_of_the_Nimitz-class_aircraft_carrier_USS_Abraham_Lincoln_(CVN_72),_uses_a_sound_level_meter_to_demonstrate_the_high_deci.jpg|right|thumb|Measurements of noise levels using a sound level meter is a component of the occupational hygiene assessment.]]An occupational hygienist may use one or a number of commercially available electronic measuring devices to measure noise, vibration, ionizing and non-ionizing radiation, dust, solvents, gases, and so on.  Each device is often specifically designed to measure a specific or particular type of contaminant.  Electronic devices need to be calibrated before and after use to ensure the accuracy of the measurements taken and often require a system of certifying the precision of the instrument.\n\nCollecting occupational exposure data is resource- and time-intensive, and can be used for different purposes, including evaluating compliance with government regulations and for planning preventive interventions.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=G\u00f3mez|first=Manuel R.|last2=Rawls|first2=Greg|date=1995-04-01|title=Conference on Occupational Exposure Databases: A Report and Look at the Future|journal=Applied Occupational and Environmental Hygiene|volume=10|issue=4|pages=238\u2013243|doi=10.1080/1047322X.1995.10389030|issn=1047-322X}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=LaMontagne|first=Anthony D.|last2=Herrick|first2=Robert F.|last3=Dyke|first3=Michael V.

'''Inhalable''' dust is determined using the modern equivalent of the [[Institute of Occupational Medicine]] (IOM) MRE 113A monitor (see section on workplace exposure, measurement & modelling).  Inhalable dust is considered to be dust of less than 100 micrometers aerodynamic equivalent diameter (AED) that enters through the nose and or mouth.  See [[Lungs]]\n\n'''Respirable''' dust is sampled using a cyclone dust sampler design to sample for a specific fraction of dust AED at a set flow rate.  The respirable dust fraction is dust that enters the 'deep lung' and is considered to be less than 10 micrometers AED.\n\nNuisance, inhalable and respirable dust fractions are all sampled using a constant volumetric pump for a specific sampling period.  By knowing the mass of the sample collected and the volume of air sampled, a concentration for the fraction sampled can be given in milligrams (mg) per metre cubed (m<sup>3</sup>).  From such samples, the amount of inhalable or respirable dust can be determined and compared to the relevant [[Occupational exposure limit|occupational exposure limits]].\n\nBy use of inhalable, respirable or other suitable sampler (7 hole, 5 hole, et cetera), these dust sampling methods can also used to determine metal exposure in the air.  This requires collection of the sample on a methyl-cellulose ester (MCE) filter and acid digestion of the collection media in the laboratory followed by measuring metal concentration though an atomic absorption (or emission) spectrophotometry.  Both the UK Health and Safety Laboratory <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hsl.gov.uk/publications/mdhs.html|title=Health and Safety Laboratory|website=hsl.gov.uk|access-date=2009-05-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090616185829/http://www.hsl.gov.uk/publications/mdhs.html|archive-date=2009-06-16|url-status=dead}}</ref> and NIOSH Manual of Analytical Methods <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/nmam/|title=CDC - NIOSH Publications and Products - NIOSH Manual of Analytical Methods (2003-154) -|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-04-07}}</ref> have specific methodologies for a broad range of metals in air found in industrial processing (smelting, foundries, et cetera).\n\nA further method exists for the determination of asbestos, fibreglass, synthetic mineral fibre and ceramic mineral fibre dust in air.  This is the membrane filter method (MFM) and requires the collection of the dust on a grided filter for estimation of exposure by the counting of 'conforming' fibres in 100 fields through a microscope.  Results are quantified on the basis of number of fibres per millilitre of air (f/ml).  Many countries strictly regulate the methodology applied to the MFM.\n\n====Chemical sampling====\nTwo types of chemically absorbent tubes are used to sample for a wide range of chemical substances.  Traditionally a chemical absorbent 'tube' (a glass or stainless steel tube of between 2 and 10&nbsp;mm internal diameter) filled with very fine absorbent silica (hydrophilic) or carbon, such as coconut charcoal (lypophylic), is used in a sampling line where air is drawn through the absorbent material for between four hours (minimum workplace sample) to 24 hours (environmental sample) period.  The hydrophilic material readily absorbs water-soluble chemical and the lypophylic material absorbs non water-soluble materials.  The absorbent material is then chemically or physically extracted and measurements performed using various gas chromatograph or mass spectrometry methods.  These absorbent tube methods have the advantage of being usable for a wide range of potential contaminates.  However, they are relatively expensive methods, are time consuming and require significant expertise in sampling and chemical analysis.  A frequent complaint of workers is in having to wear the sampling pump (up to 1&nbsp;kg) for several days of work to provide adequate data for the required statistical certainty determination of the exposure.\n\nIn the last few decades, advances have been made in 'passive' badge technology.  These samplers can now be purchased to measure one chemical (e.g. formaldehyde) or a chemical type (e.g. ketones) or a broad spectrum of chemicals (e.g. solvents).  They are relatively easy to set up and use.  However, considerable cost can still be incurred in analysis of the 'badge'.  They weigh 20 to 30&nbsp;grams and workers do not complain about their presence.  Unfortunately 'badges' may not exist for all types of workplace sampling that may be required, and the charcoal or silica method may sometimes have to be applied.\n\nFrom the sampling method, results are expressed in milligrams per cubic meter (mg/m<sup>3</sup>) or parts per million (PPM) and compared to the relevant [[Occupational exposure limit|occupational exposure limits]].\n\nIt is a critical part of the exposure determination that the method of sampling for the specific contaminate exposure is directly linked to the exposure standard used.  Many countries regulate both the exposure standard, the method used to determine the exposure and the methods to be used for chemical or other analysis of the samples collected.\n[[File:Hierarchies_of_Exposure_Assessment_and_Management.JPG|thumb|Simple representation of exposure risk assessment and management hierarchy based on available information]]\n\n===Exposure management and controls===\nThe [[hierarchy of control]] defines the approach used to reduce exposure risks protecting workers and communities.  These methods include [[Hazard elimination|elimination]], [[Hazard substitution|substitution]], [[engineering controls]] (isolation or ventilation), [[administrative controls]] and [[personal protective equipment]].  Occupational hygienists, engineers, maintenance, management and employees should all be consulted for selecting and designing the most effective and efficient controls based on the hierarchy of control.\n\n==Professional societies==\nThe development of industrial hygiene societies originated in the United States, beginning with the first convening of members for the [[American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists]] in 1938, and the formation of the [[American Industrial Hygiene Association]] in 1939. In the United Kingdom, the [[British Occupational Hygiene Society]] started in 1953. Through the years, professional occupational societies have formed in many different countries, leading to the formation of the [http://www.ioha.net/ International Occupational Hygiene Association] in 1987, in order to promote and develop occupational hygiene worldwide through the member organizations.<ref name=\"ioha3\">{{cite web|url=http://ioha.net/aboutioha.html|title=About IOHA|publisher=International Occupational Hygiene Association|accessdate=8 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106191127/http://www.ioha.net/aboutioha.html|archive-date=2012-11-06|url-status=dead}}</ref> The IOHA has grown to 29 member organizations, representing over 20,000 occupational hygienists worldwide, with representation from countries present in every continent.<ref name=\"ioha3\" /><ref name=\"ioha22\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ioha.net/nationalsocieties.html|title=National Societies|publisher=International Occupational Hygiene Association|accessdate=8 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106191225/http://ioha.net/nationalsocieties.html|archive-date=2012-11-06|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Peer-reviewed literature==\nThere are several academic journals specifically focused on publishing studies and research in the occupational health field. The ''Journal of Occupational and Environmental Hygiene'' (JOEH) has been published jointly since 2004 by the [[American Industrial Hygiene Association]] and the [[American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists]], replacing the former ''American Industrial Hygiene Association Journal'' and ''Applied Occupational & Environmental Hygiene'' journals.<ref name=\"joeh2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/action/aboutThisJournal?show=aimsScope&journalCode=uoeh20|title=Taylor & Francis Online:: Journal of Occupational and Environmental Hygiene - Aims & Scope|accessdate=8 November 2012}}</ref> Another seminal occupational hygiene journal would be ''The Annals of Occupational Hygiene,'' published by the [[British Occupational Hygiene Society]] since 1958.<ref name=\"annals2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordjournals.org/our_journals/annhyg/about.html|title=Oxford Journals \u2013 Life Sciences & Medicine \u2013 ''The Annals of Occupational Hygiene''|accessdate=8 November 2012}}</ref> Further, [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] maintains a searchable bibliographic database (NIOSHTIC-2) of occupational safety and health publications, documents, grant reports, and other communication products.<ref name=\"nioshtic2\">{{cite web|url=http://www2.cdc.gov/nioshtic-2/n2info.asp|title=About NIOSHTIC-2 \u2013 CDC/NIOSH|publisher=NIOSH|accessdate=8 November 2012}}</ref>\n[[File:Hierarchy_of_Controls.PNG|right|thumb|350x350px|The hierarchy of controls is an important tool to determine how to control hazards most efficiently and effectively in a workplace.]]\n\n==Occupational hygiene as a career==\nExamples of occupational hygiene careers include:\n* Compliance officer on behalf of regulatory agency\n* Professional working on behalf of company for the protection of the workforce\n* Consultant working on behalf of companies\n* Researcher performing laboratory or field occupational hygiene work\n\n=== Education ===\nThe basis of the technical knowledge of occupational hygiene is from competent training in the following areas of science and management:\n* Basic Sciences (Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics (Statistics), Physics);\n* Occupational Diseases (Illness, injury and health surveillance (biostatistics, epidemiology, toxicology));\n* Health Hazards (Biological, Chemical and Physical hazards, Ergonomics and Human Factors);\n* Working Environments (Mining, Industrial, Manufacturing, transport and storage, service industries and offices);\n* Programme Management Principles (professional and business ethics, work site and incident investigation methods, exposure guidelines, [[Occupational exposure limit|Occupational exposure limits]], jurisdictional based regulations, hazard identification, risk assessment and risk communication, data management, fire evacuation and other emergency responses);\n* Sampling, measurement and evaluation practices (instrumentation, sampling protocols, methods or techniques, analytical chemistry);\n* Hazard Controls (elimination, substitution, engineering, administrative, PPE and Air Conditioning and Extraction Ventilation);\n* Environment (air pollution, hazardous waste).\nHowever, it is not rote knowledge that identifies a competent occupational hygienist.  There is an \"art\" to applying the technical principles in a manner that provides a reasonable solution for workplace and environmental issues.  In effect an experienced \"mentor\", who has experience in occupational hygiene is required to show a new occupational hygienist how to apply the learned scientific and management knowledge in the workplace and to the environment issue to satisfactorily resolve the problem.\n\nTo be a professional occupational hygienist, experience in as wide a practice as possible is required to demonstrate knowledge in areas of occupational hygiene.  This is difficult for \"specialists\" or those who practice in narrow subject areas.  Limiting experience to individual subject like asbestos remediation, confined spaces, indoor air quality, or lead abatement, or learning only through a textbook or \u201creview course\u201d can be a disadvantage when required to demonstrate competence in other areas of occupational hygiene.\n\nInformation presented in Wikipedia can be considered to be only an outline of the requirements for professional occupational hygiene training.  This is because the actual requirements in any country, state or region may vary due to educational resources available, industry demand or regulatory mandated requirements.\n\nDuring 2010, the Occupational Hygiene Training Association (OHTA) through sponsorship provided by the IOHA initiated a training scheme for those with an interest in or those requiring training in occupational hygiene. These training modules can be downloaded and used freely. The available subject modules (Basic Principles in Occupational Hygiene, Health Effects of Hazardous Substances, Measurement of Hazardous Substances, Thermal Environment, Noise, Asbestos, Control, Ergonomics) are aimed at the \u2018foundation\u2019 and \u2018intermediate\u2019 levels in Occupational Hygiene. Although the modules can be used freely without supervision, attendance at an accredited training course is encouraged. These training modules are available from [http://www.ohlearning.com/ OH Learning.com]\n\nAcademic programs offering industrial hygiene bachelor's or master's degrees in United States may apply to the [[Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology]] (ABET) to have their program accredited.  As of October 1, 2006, 27 institutions have accredited their industrial hygiene programs.  Accreditation is not available for Doctoral programs.\n\nIn the U.S., the training of IH professionals is supported by [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] through their [[NIOSH Education and Research Centers]].\n\n===Professional credentials===\n====Australia====\nIn 2005, the Australian Institute of Occupational Hygiene (AIOH) has accredited professional occupational hygienist through a certification scheme.  Occupational Hygienists in Australian certified through this scheme are entitled to use the phrase '''Certified Occupational Hygienist''' (COH) as part of their qualifications.\n\n====United States of America====\nPractitioners who successfully meet specific education and work-experience requirements and pass a written examination administered by the [http://www.abih.org/ American Board of Industrial Hygiene] (ABIH) are authorized to use the term '''Certified Industrial Hygienist''' (CIH) or '''Certified Associate Industrial Hygienist''' (CAIH).  Both of these terms have been codified into law in many states in the United States to identify minimum qualifications of individuals having oversight over certain activities that may affect employee and general public health.\n\nAfter the initial certification, the CIH or CAIH maintains their certification by meeting on-going requirements for ethical behavior, education, and professional activities (e.g., active practice, technical committees, publishing, teaching).\n\nABIH certification examinations are offered during a spring and fall testing window each year at more than 400 locations worldwide.\n\nThe CIH designation is the most well known and recognized industrial hygiene designation throughout the world. There are approximately 6800 CIHs in the world making ABIH the largest industrial hygiene certification organization. The CAIH certification program was discontinued in 2006. Those who were certified as a CAIH retain their certification through ongoing certification maintenance. People who are currently certified by the ABIH can be found in a [https://web.archive.org/web/20110713093558/http://www.abih.org/members/roster/rostersearch.cfm public roster].\n\nThe ABIH is a recognized certification board by the International Occupational Hygiene Association (IOHA). The CIH certification has been accredited internationally by the International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC 17024) (see ANSI). In the United States, the CIH has been accredited by the Council of Engineering and Scientific Specialty Boards [CESB].\n\nThe Association of Professional Industrial Hygienists, Inc. (APIH) was established in 1994 to offer credentialing to industrial hygienists who meet the education and experience requirements found in Tennessee Code Annotated, Title 62, Chapter 40.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://apih.us/|title=Association of Professional Industrial Hygienists|website=apih.us|access-date=2016-04-07}}</ref> APIH adopted the Tennessee Code as its basis for credentialing because it was the first legal definition in the United States of an industrial hygienist in terms of education and experience. The APIH Registration Committee investigates and verifies, through electronic means or correspondence, both educational and experience accomplishments claimed by each applicant for registration. The Committee determines the appropriate level of registration, '''Registered Industrial Hygienist''' or '''Registered Professional Industrial Hygienist''', and then authorizes the registration certificate to be issued.\n\n====Canada====\nIn Canada, a practitioner who successfully completes a written test and an interview administered by the [http://www.crboh.ca/ Canadian Registration Board of Occupational Hygienists] can be recognized as a '''Registered Occupational Hygienist''' (ROH) or '''Registered Occupational Hygiene Technician''' (ROHT).  There is also designation to be recognized as a '''Canadian Registered Safety Professional''' (CRSP).\n\n====United Kingdom====\nThe Faculty of Occupational Hygiene, part of the British Occupational Hygiene Society, represents the interests of professional occupational hygienists.\n\nMembership of the Faculty of Occupational Hygiene is confined to BOHS members who hold a recognized professional qualification in occupational hygiene.\n\nThere are three grades of Faculty membership:\n* Licentiate (LFOH) holders will have obtained the BOHS Certificate of Operational Competence in Occupational Hygiene and have at least three years\u2019 practical experience in the field.\n* Members (MFOH) are normally holders of the Diploma of Professional Competence in Occupational Hygiene and have at least five years\u2019 experience at a senior level.\n* Fellows (FFOH) are senior members of the profession who have made a distinct contribution to the advancement of occupational hygiene.\n\nAll Faculty members participate in a Continuous Professional Development (CPD) scheme designed to maintain a high level of current awareness and knowledge in occupational hygiene.\n\n====India====\nThe Indian Society of Industrial hygiene was formed in 1981 at Chennai, India. Subsequently, its secretariat was shifted to Kanpur. The society has registered about 400 members, about 90 of whom are life members. The society publishes a newsletter, \"Industrial Hygiene Link\". The current address of the secretary of the society is Shyam Singh Gautam, Secretary, Indian Society of Industrial Hygiene, 11, Shakti Nagar, Rama Devi, Kanpur 2008005 Mobile number 8005187037.\n\n==See also==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n*{{annotated link|Astronautical hygiene}}\n*{{annotated link|Human factors and ergonomics}}\n*{{annotated link|Exposure assessment}}\n*{{annotated link|Indoor air quality}}\n*{{annotated link|Infection control}}\n*{{annotated link|Institute of Occupational Medicine}}\n*{{annotated link|Noise Control}}\n\n{{col-2}}\n*{{annotated link|Occupational exposure limit}}\n*{{annotated link|Occupational epidemiology}}\n*{{annotated link|Occupational safety and health }}\n*{{annotated link|Occupational health nursing}}\n*{{annotated link|Occupational Health Science|''Occupational Health Science''}}\n*{{annotated link|Occupational therapy}}\n*{{annotated link|Toxicity}}\n*{{annotated link|Yant Award}}\n{{col-end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [http://www.who.int/occupational_health/publications/en/ World Health Organization Occupational Health Publications]\n* [http://www.ilocis.org/en/contilo.html International Labour Organization Encyclopaedia of Occupational Health and Safety], {{ISBN|92-2-109203-8}}[http://www.ilo.org/public/english/region/ampro/cinterfor/sid/servicio/encyclo/index.htm <nowiki>[1]</nowiki>]\n* [http://www.hse.gov.uk/infoserv/hseline.htm UK HSEline]\n* [http://www.epa.gov/iaq/largebldgs/i-beam/index.html EPA Indoor Air Quality on-line educator]\n* [http://www.ccohs.ca/topics/hazards/ Canada hazard information]\n* [http://www.ilpi.com/msds/index.html A list of MSDS sites] (Partly commercial)\n* [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/ (US) NIOSH Pocket Guide]\n* [http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/ (US) Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry]\n* [http://www.toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/ (US) National Library of Medicine Toxicology Data Network]\n* [http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ (US) National Toxicology Program]\n* [http://www.iarc.fr/ International Agency for Research on Cancer]\n* [http://ccinfoweb.ccohs.ca/rtecs/search.html RTECS] (by subscription only)\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100311082143/http://www.chemfinder.com/chembiofinder/Forms/Home/ContentArea/Home.aspx Chemfinder]\n* [http://www.inchem.org/ Inchem]\n* Many larger businesses maintain their own product and chemical information.\n* There are also many subscription services available (CHEMINFO, OSH, CHEMpendium, Chem Alert, Chemwatch, Infosafe, RightAnswer.com's TOMES Plus, OSH Update, OSH-ROM, et cetera).\n\n==External links==\n{{Commonscat|Industrial hygiene}}\n*[http://www.turnstoneehs.net/industrial-hygiene/hexavalent-chromium-national-emphasis-program.htm (OSHA) passed standards on exposure to hexavalent chromium - Hexavalent Chromium National Emphasis Program]\n*[https://www.acgih.org/ American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists] (ACGIH)\n*[https://www.aiha.org/Pages/default.aspx American Industrial Hygiene Association]\n*[http://www.labour.gov.hk/eng/public/oh/impurities.pdf Government of Hong Kong Occupational Safety and Health Council, Air Contaminants in the Workplace]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070404113424/http://www.aiha.org/1documents/students/IndustrialHygieneStudentPowerpointsmallversion.ppt View a PowerPoint Presentation Explaining What Industrial Hygiene Is - developed and made available by AIHA]\n*[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/nmam/ The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health Manual of Analytical Methods (NMAM)]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090616185829/http://www.hsl.gov.uk/publications/mdhs.html UK Health and Safety Executive, Health and Safety Laboratory, Methods for the Determination of Hazardous Substances (MDHS)]\n*[http://www.iso.org/iso/home.htm International Organization for Standardization (ISO)]\n*[http://www.ioha.net/ International Occupational Hygiene Association (IOHA)]\n\n{{Public health}}\n{{Occupational safety and health}}\n{{Aspects of occupations}}\n{{Underwater diving|divsaf}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Occupational Hygiene}}\n[[Category:Industrial hygiene| ]]\n[[Category:Occupational safety and health]]\n", "name_user": "Crouch, Swale", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toMold(link changed toMold (fungus)) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_hygiene"}
