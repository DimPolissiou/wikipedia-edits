He notes that this slip is normally made only by the English themselves and by foreigners: \"Non-English members of the United Kingdom rarely say 'British' when they mean 'English'\". Kumar suggests that although this blurring is a sign of England's dominant position with the UK, it is also \"problematic for the English [...] when it comes to conceiving of their national identity.

During this period the language and culture of most of what became England changed from [[Romano-British]] to [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]].<ref>The area of [[Lothian]] in modern Scotland was also anglicised in this period, following the conquest of the British \"kingdom\" of [[Manau Gododdin]]. It formed part of the Anglian kingdoms of [[Bernicia]] and [[Northumbria]], only becoming a part of Scotland as late as 1018, when a recent Scottish annexation was recognised by the English. See: Fry, P.S. and Mitchison, R. (1985) ''The History of Scotland'', Routledge, p. 48</ref> The Germanic speakers in Britain, themselves of diverse origins, developed a common cultural identity as [[Anglo-Saxons]] during the mid-fifth to early seventh centuries, after the [[Roman withdrawal from Britain|end of Roman power in Britain]] around the year 410. The settlement was followed by the establishment of [[Heptarchy|Anglo-Saxon kingdoms]] in the south and east of [[Great Britain|Britain]], later followed by the rest of modern England.\n\nThe available evidence includes the scanty contemporary and near-contemporary written record, and archaeological and genetic information.{{efn| A sample of this discussion can be seen on the television series ''Britain AD: King Arthur's Britain'', particularly the discussion between Francis Pryor and Heinrich H\u00e4rke.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Channel 4|2004}}, Episode 3 ''Britain AD: King Arthur's Britain''.</ref>}} The few literary sources tell of hostility between incomers and natives. They describe violence, destruction, massacre and the flight of the Romano-British population. Moreover, there is little clear evidence for the influence of [[British Celtic]] or [[British Latin]] on the [[Old English]] language. These factors have suggested a very large-scale invasion by various Germanic peoples. In this view, held by the majority of historians until the mid to late 20th century, much of what is now England was cleared of its prior inhabitants, and thus the genes of the later English people would have been overwhelmingly inherited from Germanic migrants.\n\n[[File:LindisfarneFol27rIncipitMatt.jpg|thumb|The [[Incipit]] to Matthew from the [[Book of Lindisfarne]], an Insular masterpiece]]\n\nHowever, another view, probably the most widely held today, is that the migrants were fewer, possibly centred on a warrior elite \u2013 which would suggest that the incomers, having achieved a position of political and social dominance, [[acculturation|acculturated]] the natives to their language and [[material culture]], and intermarried with them to a significant degree. Archaeologists have found that settlement patterns and land use show no clear break with the Romano-British past, though there are marked changes in place names and material culture. This view predicts that the ancestry of the people of Anglo-Saxon and modern England would be largely derived from the native Romano-British. The uncertain results of genetic studies have tended to support both a predominant amount of native British Celtic ancestry, as well as a significant contribution from Anglo-Saxon migrations.\n\nEven so, if these incomers established themselves as a [[social elite]], this could have allowed them enhanced reproductive success (the so-called '[[Apartheid]] Theory'). In this case, the prevalent genes of later [[Anglo-Saxon England]] could have been largely derived from moderate numbers of Germanic migrants.<ref>Brugmann, B.

The Anglo-Saxons gave their name to England (''Engla land'', meaning \"Land of the Angles\") and to the English.\n\nThe Anglo-Saxons arrived in a land that was already populated by people commonly referred to as the '[[Romano-British]]'\u2014the descendants of the native Brythonic-speaking population that lived in the area of Britain under Roman rule during the 1st\u20135th centuries AD. The multi-ethnic nature of the [[Roman Empire]] meant that small numbers of other peoples may have also been present in England before the Anglo-Saxons arrived. There is archaeological evidence, for example, of an early North African presence in a Roman garrison at [[Aballava]], now [[Burgh-by-Sands]], in Cumbria: a 4th-century inscription says that the Roman military unit ''Numerus Maurorum Aurelianorum'' (\"unit of Aurelian Moors\") from Mauretania (Morocco) was stationed there.<ref>[http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/B/blackhistorymap/arch.html The archaeology of black Britain], Channel 4.

At first, the Vikings were very much considered a separate people from the English. This separation was enshrined when [[Alfred the Great]] signed the [[Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum]] to establish the Danelaw, a division of England between English and Danish rule, with the Danes occupying northern and eastern England.<ref>''The Age of Athelstan'' by Paul Hill (2004), Tempus Publishing. {{ISBN|0-7524-2566-8}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Alfred's successors subsequently won military victories against the Danes, incorporating much of the Danelaw into the nascent kingdom of England. Danish invasions continued into the 11th century, and there were both English and Danish kings in the period following the unification of England (for example, [[Ethelred the Unready|\u00c6thelred II]] (978\u20131013 and 1014\u20131016) was English but [[Cnut the Great|Cnut]] (1016\u20131035) was Danish).\n\nGradually, the Danes in England came to be seen as 'English'.

Before then, there were a number of [[petty kingdom]]s which gradually coalesced into a [[heptarchy]] of seven states, the most powerful of which were [[Mercia]] and [[Wessex]]. The English [[nation state]] began to form when the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms united against Danish Viking invasions, which began around 800 AD. Over the following century and a half England was for the most part a politically unified entity, and remained permanently so after 959.\n\nThe nation of England was formed in 937 by [[\u00c6thelstan]] of Wessex after the [[Battle of Brunanburh]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/athelstan.shtml|title= Athelstan (c.895\u2013939) : Historic Figures|website=Bbc.co.uk|accessdate=30 October 2006}}</ref><ref>''[https://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A3483029 The Battle of Brunanburh, 937AD]'' by [[h2g2]], [[BBC]] website.

After the conquest, \"English\" normally included all natives of England, whether they were of Anglo-Saxon, Scandinavian or Celtic ancestry, to distinguish them from the Norman invaders, who were regarded as \"Norman\" even if born in England, for a generation or two after the Conquest.<ref>''[[OED]]'', 2nd edition, s.v.

For example, Orderic Vitalis, a historian born in 1075 and the son of a Norman knight, said that he learned French only as a second language.

The [[Parliament of Scotland]] had previously passed its own Act of Union, so the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] was born on 1 May 1707. In 1801, another [[Act of Union 1800|Act of Union]] formed a union between the Kingdom of Great Britain and the [[Kingdom of Ireland]], creating the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]. In 1922, about two-thirds of the Irish population (those who lived in 26 of the 32 counties of Ireland), left the United Kingdom to form the [[Irish Free State]]. The remainder became the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, although this name was not introduced until 1927, after some years in which the term \"United Kingdom\" had been little used.\n\nThroughout the history of the UK, the English have been dominant in population and in political weight. As a consequence, notions of 'Englishness' and 'Britishness' are often very similar. At the same time, after the Union of 1707, the English, along with the other peoples of the British Isles, have been encouraged to think of themselves as British rather than to identify themselves with the constituent nations.<ref>''The English'', [[Jeremy Paxman]] 1998{{Page needed|date=September 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Immigration and assimilation===\n{{See also|Historical immigration to Great Britain|Immigration to the United Kingdom (1922-present day)}}\n\nEngland has been the destination of varied numbers of migrants at different periods from the 17th century onwards.

Through newspapers, books, the telegraph, the telephone, phonograph records, radio, satellite television, broadcasters (such as the [[BBC]]) and the Internet, as well as the emergence of the United States as a global superpower, Modern English has become the [[international auxiliary language|international language]] of [[business]], [[science]], [[communication]], [[sports]], [[aviation]], and [[diplomacy]].\n\n===Literature===\n{{Main|English literature}}\n{{Section OR|date=February 2020}}{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\n\n[[File:Portrait of Geoffrey Chaucer (4671380) (cropped) 02.jpg|thumb|''Geoffrey Chaucer''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|t\u0283|\u0254\u02d0|s|\u0259r}}; {{circa|1340s}} \u2013 25 October 1400) was an English poet and author. Widely seen as the greatest English poet of the [[Middle Ages]], he is best known for ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]''.]]\n\nEnglish literature begins with [[Anglo-Saxon literature]], which was written in [[Old English]] and produced epic works such as [[Beowulf]] and the fragmentary [[The Battle of Maldon]], [[The Seafarer (poem)|The Seafarer]] and [[The Wanderer (Old English poem)|The Wanderer]]. For many years, [[Latin]] and [[French language|French]] were the preferred literary languages of England, but in the [[medieval period]] there was a flourishing of literature in [[Middle English]]; [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] is the most famous writer of this period. \n\nThe [[Elizabethan era]] is sometimes described as the golden age of English literature with writers such as [[William Shakespeare]], [[Thomas Nashe]], [[Edmund Spenser]], [[Sir Philip Sidney]], [[Christopher Marlowe]] and [[Ben Jonson]].\n\nOther famous English writers include [[Jane Austen]], [[Arnold Bennett]], [[Rupert Brooke]], [[Agatha Christie]], [[Charles Dickens]], [[Thomas Hardy]], [[A. E. Housman]], [[George Orwell]] and the [[Lake Poets]].\n\nDue to the expansion of English into a [[world language]] during the British Empire, literature is now written in English across the world.\n\nIn 2003 the [[BBC]] carried out a UK survey entitled ''[[The Big Read]]'' in order to find the \"nation's best-loved novel\" of all time, with works by English novelists [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], [[Jane Austen]], [[Philip Pullman]], [[Douglas Adams]] and [[J. K. Rowling]] making up the top five on the list.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/bigread/top100.shtml BBC \u2013 The Big Read \u2013 Top 100 Books].

In their 2004 Annual Population Survey, the [[Office for National Statistics]] compared the ''ethnic'' identities of British people with their perceived [[national identity]]. They found that while 58% of [[white people]] in England described their nationality as \"English\", the vast majority of non-white people called themselves \"British\".<ref>\"78 per cent of [[British Bangladeshi|Bangladeshis]] said they were British, while only 5 per cent said they were English, Scottish or Welsh\", and the largest percentage of non-whites to identify as English were the people who described their ethnicity as \"[[mixed race|Mixed]]\" (37%).[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?id=459 'Identity', ''National Statistics'', 21 February 2006]</ref>\n\n===Relationship to Britishness===\nIt is unclear how many British people consider themselves English. In the [[2001 UK census]], respondents were invited to state their ethnicity, but while there were [[Tick (checkmark)|tick boxes]] for '[[Irish people|Irish']] and for '[[Scottish people|Scottish']], there were none for 'English', or '[[Welsh people|Welsh']], who were subsumed into the general heading 'White British'.<ref>[http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/grosweb/grosweb.nsf/pages/file5/$file/supporting_information.pdf Scotland's Census 2001: Supporting Information] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217074049/http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/grosweb/grosweb.nsf/pages/file5/$file/supporting_information.pdf |date=17 December 2008 }} ([[PDF]]; see p. 43)</ref><ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2001/04/23/ncen23.xml Philip Johnston, \"Tory MP leads English protest over census\", ''The Daily Telegraph'' (London) 15 June 2006].</ref> Following complaints about this, the 2011 census was changed to \"allow respondents to record their English, Welsh, Scottish, Northern Irish, Irish or other identity.\"<ref>[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/census/2011Census/CollectingtheInfo/questionnairedevelopment.asp 'Developing the Questionnaires', ''National Statistics Office''].</ref>  Another complication in defining the English is a common tendency for the words \"English\" and \"British\" to be used interchangeably, especially outside the UK. In his study of English identity, [[Krishan Kumar (sociologist)|Krishan Kumar]] describes a common slip of the tongue in which people say \"English, I mean British\". He notes that this slip is normally made only by the English themselves and by foreigners: \"Non-English members of the United Kingdom rarely say 'British' when they mean 'English'\".

During this period the language and culture of most of what became England changed from [[Romano-British]] to [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]].<ref>The area of [[Lothian]] in modern Scotland was also anglicised in this period, following the conquest of the British \"kingdom\" of [[Manau Gododdin]]. It formed part of the Anglian kingdoms of [[Bernicia]] and [[Northumbria]], only becoming a part of Scotland as late as 1018, when a recent Scottish annexation was recognised by the English. See: Fry, P.S. and Mitchison, R. (1985) ''The History of Scotland'', Routledge, p. 48</ref> The Germanic speakers in Britain, themselves of diverse origins, developed a common cultural identity as [[Anglo-Saxons]] during the mid-fifth to early seventh centuries, after the [[Roman withdrawal from Britain|end of Roman power in Britain]] around the year 410. The settlement was followed by the establishment of [[Heptarchy|Anglo-Saxon kingdoms]] in the south and east of [[Great Britain|Britain]], later followed by the rest of modern England.\n\nThe available evidence includes the scanty contemporary and near-contemporary written record, and archaeological and genetic information.{{efn| A sample of this discussion can be seen on the television series ''Britain AD: King Arthur's Britain'', particularly the discussion between Francis Pryor and Heinrich H\u00e4rke.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Channel 4|2004}}, Episode 3 ''Britain AD: King Arthur's Britain''.</ref>}} The few literary sources tell of hostility between incomers and natives. They describe violence, destruction, massacre and the flight of the Romano-British population. Moreover, there is little clear evidence for the influence of [[British Celtic]] or [[British Latin]] on the [[Old English]] language. These factors have suggested a very large-scale invasion by various Germanic peoples. In this view, held by the majority of historians until the mid to late 20th century, much of what is now England was cleared of its prior inhabitants, and thus the genes of the later English people would have been overwhelmingly inherited from Germanic migrants.\n\n[[File:LindisfarneFol27rIncipitMatt.jpg|thumb|The [[Incipit]] to Matthew from the [[Book of Lindisfarne]], an Insular masterpiece]]\n\nHowever, another view, probably the most widely held today, is that the migrants were fewer, possibly centred on a warrior elite \u2013 which would suggest that the incomers, having achieved a position of political and social dominance, [[acculturation|acculturated]] the natives to their language and [[material culture]], and intermarried with them to a significant degree. Archaeologists have found that settlement patterns and land use show no clear break with the Romano-British past, though there are marked changes in place names and material culture. This view predicts that the ancestry of the people of Anglo-Saxon and modern England would be largely derived from the native Romano-British. The uncertain results of genetic studies have tended to support both a predominant amount of native British Celtic ancestry, as well as a significant contribution from Anglo-Saxon migrations.\n\nEven so, if these incomers established themselves as a [[social elite]], this could have allowed them enhanced reproductive success (the so-called '[[Apartheid]] Theory'). In this case, the prevalent genes of later [[Anglo-Saxon England]] could have been largely derived from moderate numbers of Germanic migrants.<ref>Brugmann, B.

The modern English language evolved from [[Middle English language|Middle English]] (the form of language in use by the English people from the 12th to the 15th century); Middle English was influenced lexically by Norman-French, Old French and Latin. In the Middle English period Latin was the language of administration and the nobility spoke Norman French. Middle English was itself derived from the [[Old English language|Old English]] of the Anglo-Saxon period; in the Northern and Eastern parts of England the language of Danish settlers had influenced the language, a fact still evident in Northern English dialects.\n\nThere were once many different dialects of modern English in England, which were recorded in projects such as the ''[[English Dialect Dictionary]]'' (late 19th century) and the [[Survey of English Dialects]] (mid 20th century), but many of these have passed out of common usage as [[Standard English]] has become more widespread through education, the media and socio-economic pressures.<ref>Wolfgang Vierick (1964), ''Der English Dialect Survey und der Linguistic Survey of Scotland - Arbeitsmethoden und bisherige Ergebnisse'', Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Mundartforschung 31, 333-335 in {{cite book |last=Shorrocks |first=Graham |year=1999 |title=A Grammar of the Dialect of the Bolton Area, Part 1 |location=Frankfurt am Main |publisher=Peter Lang |isbn=3-631-33066-9 |page=58}}</ref>\n\n[[Cornish language|Cornish]], a [[Celtic languages|Celtic language]], is one of three existing Brythonic languages; its usage has been revived in [[Cornwall]]. Historically, another Brythonic Celtic language, [[Cumbric language|Cumbric]], was spoken in [[Cumbria]] in [[North West England]], but it died out in the 11th century although traces of it can still be found in the Cumbrian dialect. [[Early Modern English]] began in the late 15th century with the introduction of the [[printing press]] to London and the [[Great Vowel Shift]]. Through the worldwide influence of the [[British Empire]], English spread around the world from the 17th to mid-20th centuries. Through newspapers, books, the telegraph, the telephone, phonograph records, radio, satellite television, broadcasters (such as the [[BBC]]) and the Internet, as well as the emergence of the United States as a global superpower, Modern English has become the [[international auxiliary language|international language]] of [[business]], [[science]], [[communication]], [[sports]], [[aviation]], and [[diplomacy]].\n\n===Literature===\n{{Main|English literature}}\n{{Section OR|date=February 2020}}{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\n\n[[File:Portrait of Geoffrey Chaucer (4671380) (cropped) 02.jpg|thumb|''Geoffrey Chaucer''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|t\u0283|\u0254\u02d0|s|\u0259r}}; {{circa|1340s}} \u2013 25 October 1400) was an English poet and author. Widely seen as the greatest English poet of the [[Middle Ages]], he is best known for ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]''.]]\n\nEnglish literature begins with [[Anglo-Saxon literature]], which was written in [[Old English]] and produced epic works such as [[Beowulf]] and the fragmentary [[The Battle of Maldon]], [[The Seafarer (poem)|The Seafarer]] and [[The Wanderer (Old English poem)|The Wanderer]]. For many years, [[Latin]] and [[French language|French]] were the preferred literary languages of England, but in the [[medieval period]] there was a flourishing of literature in [[Middle English]]; [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] is the most famous writer of this period. \n\nThe [[Elizabethan era]] is sometimes described as the golden age of English literature with writers such as [[William Shakespeare]], [[Thomas Nashe]], [[Edmund Spenser]], [[Sir Philip Sidney]], [[Christopher Marlowe]] and [[Ben Jonson]].\n\nOther famous English writers include [[Jane Austen]], [[Arnold Bennett]], [[Rupert Brooke]], [[Agatha Christie]], [[Charles Dickens]], [[Thomas Hardy]], [[A. E. Housman]], [[George Orwell]] and the [[Lake Poets]].\n\nDue to the expansion of English into a [[world language]] during the British Empire, literature is now written in English across the world.\n\nIn 2003 the [[BBC]] carried out a UK survey entitled ''[[The Big Read]]'' in order to find the \"nation's best-loved novel\" of all time, with works by English novelists [[J.

PFOA is considered a surfactant, or fluorosurfactant, due to its chemical structure consisting of a perfluorinated, ''n''-octyl \"tail group\" and a [[carboxylate]] \"head group\". The head group can be described as [[hydrophilic]] while the [[fluorocarbon]] tail is both [[hydrophobic]] and [[lipophobic]]. The tail group is inert and does not interact strongly with polar or non-polar chemical [[Moiety (chemistry)|moieties]]; the head group is reactive and interacts strongly with polar groups, specifically water. The \"tail\" is hydrophobic due to being [[non-polar]] and lipophobic because fluorocarbons are less susceptible to the [[London dispersion force]] than [[hydrocarbon]]s.<ref name=\"Lemal2004\">{{cite journal|author=Lemal DM|date=January 2004|title=Perspective on fluorocarbon chemistry|journal=J.

PFOA serves as a surfactant in the [[emulsion polymerization]] of [[fluoropolymers]] and as a building block for the synthesis of perfluoroalkyl-substituted compounds, polymers, and polymeric materials.

A positive exposure-response trend for kidney cancer is supported by many studies. PFOA has been detected in the blood of more than 98% of the general US population in the low and sub-[[parts per billion]] (ppb) range, and levels are higher in chemical plant employees and surrounding subpopulations. How general populations are exposed to PFOA is not completely understood. PFOA has been detected in industrial waste, stain-resistant carpets, carpet-cleaning liquids, [[house dust]], [[Popcorn bag|microwave popcorn bags]], water, food, and Teflon ([[PTFE]]) products.\n\nAs a result of a class-action lawsuit and community settlement with [[DuPont]], three [[Epidemiology|epidemiologists]] conducted studies on the population surrounding a chemical plant that was exposed to PFOA at levels greater than in the general population.

The study consisted of 32,254 residents with 2,507 reported cancer diagnoses occurring during study period. PFOA serum concentrations were measured at baseline and three to six year follow-up meetings. Retrospective yearly PFOA serum levels were estimated for each subject from 1952 through 2011.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Barry|first=Vaughn|last2=Winquist|first2=Andrea|last3=Steenland|first3=Kyle|date=November 2013|title=Perfluorooctanoic Acid (PFOA) Exposures and Incident Cancers among Adults Living Near a Chemical Plant|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|volume=121|issue=11\u201312|pages=1313\u20131318|doi=10.1289/ehp.1306615|issn=0091-6765|pmc=3855514|pmid=24007715}}</ref>\n\nInitial subject recruitment was performed using eligibility criteria and surveys\u2014subjects were eligible if they lived or worked in one of the six contaminated water districts for at least one year between 1950 and December 3, 2004.

Historical regional data including emission rates by the DuPont facility, temporal patterns and groundwater flow are incorporated in the model as well as individual &nbsp;specific occupational exposure level was included.

Cancer diagnoses were verified using Ohio/West Virginia cancer registries.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nA proportional hazards regression model was used for each cancer type with the cancer as the outcome and PFOA serum level included as a time-varying covariate. Participants were followed from age 20 (or age in 1952) to the age of cancer diagnosis. Models were adjusted for time-varying- smoking and alcohol consumption, as well as sex, education and 5-year birth cohort. The outcome of PFOA serum level was log-transformed due to the scarcity of very high cumulative exposure values.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nParticipants who worked at the DuPont facility had higher PFOA serum levels and higher estimated annual PFOA levels than subjects who never worked at the facility. After cancer diagnosis validation, thyroid, kidney and testicular cancer risk were found to increase with an increase in the PFOA serum concentration (log-transformed), with testicular cancer being significantly associated (\u03b1 =0.05). The results are consistent with previous mortality analyses performed using DuPont data. There is a positive exposure-response trend for cancer incidence and PFOA serum levels. Kidney and testicular cancer are of interest given that animal studies have found that PFOA is distributed mainly in the kidneys and because PFOA has been found to induce testicular tumors in rats.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n'''Impact of In Utero Exposure on Reproductive Organs'''\n\nDue to the fact that PFOA is able to readily pass through the placental barrier, exposure is of particular concern during in utero development.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Vested|first=Anne|last2=Ramlau-Hansen|first2=Cecilia H\u00f8st|last3=Olsen|first3=Sjurdur Frodi|last4=Bonde|first4=Jens Peter|last5=Kristensen|first5=Susanne Lund|last6=Halldorsson|first6=Thorhallur Ingi|last7=Becher|first7=Georg|last8=Haug|first8=Line Sm\u00e5stuen|last9=Ernst|first9=Emil Hagen|date=April 2013|title=Associations of in utero exposure to perfluorinated alkyl acids with human semen quality and reproductive hormones in adult men|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|volume=121|issue=4|pages=453\u2013458|doi=10.1289/ehp.1205118|issn=1552-9924|pmc=3620740|pmid=23360585}}</ref> Numerous studies have analyzed the impacts of PFOA on fetal development of reproductive organs.

For example, a study following a Danish population-based cohort found a 5.3 month later age of menarche in girls exposed to higher levels of PFOA in utero.

PFOA is considered a surfactant, or fluorosurfactant, due to its chemical structure consisting of a perfluorinated, ''n''-octyl \"tail group\" and a [[carboxylate]] \"head group\". The head group can be described as [[hydrophilic]] while the [[fluorocarbon]] tail is both [[hydrophobic]] and [[lipophobic]]. The tail group is inert and does not interact strongly with polar or non-polar chemical [[Moiety (chemistry)|moieties]]; the head group is reactive and interacts strongly with polar groups, specifically water. The \"tail\" is hydrophobic due to being [[non-polar]] and lipophobic because fluorocarbons are less susceptible to the [[London dispersion force]] than [[hydrocarbon]]s.<ref name=\"Lemal2004\">{{cite journal|author=Lemal DM|date=January 2004|title=Perspective on fluorocarbon chemistry|journal=J.

PFOA serves as a surfactant in the [[emulsion polymerization]] of [[fluoropolymers]] and as a building block for the synthesis of perfluoroalkyl-substituted compounds, polymers, and polymeric materials.  PFOA has been manufactured since the 1940s in industrial quantities.<ref name=\"Lindstrom\">{{cite journal |last1=Lindstrom |first1=Andrew B. |last2=Strynar |first2=Mark J. |last3=Libelo |first3=E.

A positive exposure-response trend for kidney cancer is supported by many studies. PFOA has been detected in the blood of more than 98% of the general US population in the low and sub-[[parts per billion]] (ppb) range, and levels are higher in chemical plant employees and surrounding subpopulations. How general populations are exposed to PFOA is not completely understood. PFOA has been detected in industrial waste, stain-resistant carpets, carpet-cleaning liquids, [[house dust]], [[Popcorn bag|microwave popcorn bags]], water, food, and Teflon ([[PTFE]]) products.\n\nAs a result of a class-action lawsuit and community settlement with [[DuPont]], three [[Epidemiology|epidemiologists]] conducted studies on the population surrounding a chemical plant that was exposed to PFOA at levels greater than in the general population.

PFOS and PFOA inhibit the secretion of steroid hormones in both theca cells and granulosa cells with gonadotropic stimulus. In cells without gonadotropic stimulus, PFOS inhibit theca cells but not granulosa, while PFOA inhibit granulosa cells but not theca. These differences are explained by the different types of PPARs &nbsp;in cell type. The study used concentrations below the range found in human blood circulation, suggesting that this may occur in human population.

They hope to one day attain the dream of settling down on their own piece of land. Lennie's part of the dream is merely to tend and pet [[rabbit]]s on the farm, as he loves touching soft animals, although he always accidentally kills them. This dream is one of Lennie's favorite stories, which George constantly retells. They had fled from [[Weed, California|Weed]] after Lennie touched a young woman's dress and would not let go, leading to an accusation of [[rape]]. It soon becomes clear that the two are close and George is Lennie's protector, despite his antics.\n\nAfter being hired at a farm, the pair are confronted by Curley\u2014The Boss's small, aggressive son with a [[Napoleon complex]] who dislikes larger men, and starts to target Lennie. Curley's flirtatious and provocative wife, to whom Lennie is instantly attracted, poses a problem as well. In contrast, the pair also meets Candy, an elderly ranch handyman with one hand and a loyal dog, and Slim, an intelligent and gentle [[Muleteer|jerkline-skinner]] whose dog has recently had a [[Litter (animal)|litter]] of puppies. Slim gives a puppy to Lennie and Candy, whose loyal, accomplished sheep dog was [[Animal euthanasia|put down]] by fellow ranch-hand Carlson.\n\nIn spite of problems, their dream leaps towards reality when Candy offers to pitch in $350 with George and Lennie so that they can buy a farm at the end of the month, in return for permission to live with them. The trio are ecstatic, but their joy is overshadowed when Curley attacks Lennie, who defends himself by easily crushing Curley's fist while urged on by George.\n\nNevertheless, George feels more relaxed, to the extent that he even leaves Lennie behind on the ranch while he goes into town with the other ranch hands. Lennie wanders into the stable, and chats with Crooks, the bitter, yet educated stable buck, who is isolated from the other workers due to being black. Candy finds them and they discuss their plans for the farm with Crooks, who cannot resist asking them if he can hoe a garden patch on the farm albeit scorning its possibility. Curley's wife makes another appearance and flirts with the men, especially Lennie. However, her spiteful side is shown when she belittles them and threatens to have Crooks [[lynching|lynched]].\n\nThe next day, Lennie accidentally kills his puppy while stroking it. Curley's wife enters the barn and tries to speak to Lennie, admitting that she is lonely and how her dreams of becoming a movie star are crushed, revealing her personality. After finding out about Lennie's habit, she offers to let him stroke her hair, but panics and begins to scream when she feels his strength. Lennie becomes frightened, and unintentionally breaks her neck thereafter and runs away. When the other ranch hands find the corpse, George realizes that their dream is at an end. George hurries to find Lennie, hoping he will be at the meeting place they designated in case he got into trouble.\n\nGeorge meets Lennie at their camping spot before they came to the ranch. The two sit together and George retells the beloved story of the dream, knowing it is something they will never share. He then [[Involuntary euthanasia|euthanizes]] Lennie by shooting him, because he sees it as an action in Lennie's best interest. Curley, Slim, and Carlson arrive seconds after. Only Slim realizes what happened, and consolingly leads him away. Curley and Carlson look on, unable to comprehend the subdued mood of the two men.\n\n==Characters==\n\n* '''George Milton:''' A quick-witted man who is Lennie's guardian and best friend. His friendship with Lennie helps sustain his dream of a better future. He was bound in teasing Lennie since he was young. He is described by Steinbeck in the novel as \"small and quick,\" every part of him being \"defined,\" with small strong hands on slender arms. He has a dark face and \"restless eyes\" and \"sharp, strong features\" including a \"thin, bony nose.\"\n* '''Lennie Small''': A [[Developmental disability|mentally disabled]], but gigantic and physically strong man who travels with George and is his constant companion.<ref name=\"nyt-parini\">{{Cite journal|last=Parini|first=Jay|authorlink=Jay Parini|date=1992-09-27|title=FILM; Of Bindlestiffs, Bad Times, Mice and Men|journal=The New York Times|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE6DD1F3AF934A1575AC0A964958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all|accessdate=June 17, 2008}}</ref> He dreams of \"living off the fatta' the lan'\" and being able to tend to rabbits. His love for soft things conspires against him, mostly because he does not know his own strength, and eventually becomes his undoing. Steinbeck defines his appearance as George's \"opposite,\" writing that he is a \"huge man, shapeless of face, with large, pale eyes\" and \"wide, sloping shoulders.\" Lennie walks heavily, dragging his feet a little, \"the way a bear drags his paws,\" adding that his arms do not swing at his sides, but hang loosely.\n* '''Candy''': An aging ranch handyman, Candy lost his hand in an accident and worries about his future on the ranch. Fearing that his age is making him useless, he seizes on George\u2019s description of the farm he and Lennie will have, offering his life\u2019s savings if he can join George and Lennie in owning the land.\n* '''Slim''': A \"jerkline skinner,\" the main driver of a [[mule]] team and the \"prince of the ranch\". Slim is greatly respected by many of the characters and is the only character whom Curley treats with respect. His insight, intuition, kindness and natural authority draw the other ranch hands automatically towards him, and he is significantly the only character to fully understand the bond between George and Lennie.\n* '''Curley''': The Boss' son, a young, pugnacious character, once a semi-professional boxer. He is described by others, with some irony, as \"handy\", partly because he likes to keep a glove filled with [[vaseline]] on his left hand. He is very jealous and protective of his wife and immediately develops a dislike toward Lennie. At one point, Curley loses his temper after he sees Lennie appear to laugh at him, and ends up with his hand horribly damaged after Lennie fights back against him.\n* '''Curley's wife''': A young, pretty woman, who is mistrusted by her husband. The other characters refer to her only as \"Curley's wife.\" Steinbeck explained that she is \"not a person, she's a symbol. She has no function, except to be a foil&nbsp;\u2013 and a danger to Lennie.\"<ref name=\"nyt-parini\" /> Curley's wife's preoccupation with her own beauty eventually helps precipitate her death: She allows Lennie to stroke her hair as an apparently harmless indulgence, only for her to upset Lennie when she yells at him to stop him \"mussing it.\" Lennie tries to stop her yelling and eventually, and accidentally, kills her by breaking her neck.\n* '''Crooks''': Crooks, the black stable-hand, gets his name from his crooked back. Proud, bitter, and cynical, he is isolated from the other men because of the color of his skin. Despite himself, Crooks becomes fond of Lennie, and though he claims to have seen countless men following empty dreams of buying their own land, he asks Lennie if he can go with them and hoe in the garden.\n* '''Candy's dog''': A blind dog who is described as \"old\", \"stinky\", and \"crippled\", and is killed by Carlson.\n* '''Carlson''': A \"thick bodied\" ranch hand, he kills Candy's dog with little sympathy.\n* '''The Boss''': Curley's father, the superintendent of the ranch. The ranch is owned by \"a big land company\" according to Candy.\n* '''Whit''': A young ranch hand.\n\n==Themes==\n{{quotation|In every bit of honest writing in the world there is a base theme. Try to understand men, if you understand each other you will be kind to each other. Knowing a man well never leads to hate and nearly always leads to love. There are shorter means, many of them. There is writing promoting social change, writing punishing injustice, writing in celebration of heroism, but always that base theme. Try to understand each other.|[[John Steinbeck]] in his 1938 journal entry<ref name=\"introshillinglaw\" />}}\n\nSteinbeck emphasizes dreams throughout the book.{{Clarification|date=December 2017}} George aspires to independence, to be his own boss, to have a homestead, and, most important, to be \"somebody\". Lennie aspires to be with George on his independent homestead, and to quench his [[Fixation (psychology)|fixation]] on soft objects. Candy aspires to reassert his responsibility lost with the death of his dog, and for security for his old age\u2014on George's homestead. Crooks aspires to a small homestead where he can express self-respect, security, and most of all, acceptance. Curley's wife dreams to be an actress, to satisfy her desire for fame lost when she married Curley, and an end to her loneliness.\n\nLoneliness is a significant factor in several characters' lives. Candy is lonely after his dog is gone. Curley's wife is lonely because her husband is not the friend she hoped for\u2014she deals with her loneliness by flirting with the men on the ranch, which causes Curley to increase his abusiveness and jealousy. The companionship of George and Lennie is the result of loneliness. Crooks states the theme candidly as \"A guy goes nuts if he ain't got anybody. Don't make any difference who the guy is, long's he's with you.\"<ref>Of Mice and Men, p. 71</ref> The author further reinforces this theme through subtle methods by situating the story near the town of [[Soledad, California|Soledad]], which means \"solitude\" in Spanish.<ref name=\"cliffnotebook\">{{cite book\n|last=Kirk\n|first=Susan Van\n|editor=Tracy Barr\n|editor2=Greg Tubach\n|title=Cliff Notes: On Steinbeck's Of Mice and men\n|origyear=2001\n|publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons|Wiley Publishing]]\n|location=909 Third Avenue, New York City, New York\n|isbn=0-7645-8676-9\n|year=2001\n|url-access=registration\n|url=https://archive.org/details/cliffsnotesofmic00vank\n}}</ref>\n\nDespite the need for companionship, Steinbeck emphasizes how loneliness is sustained through the barriers established from acting inhuman to one another. The loneliness of Curley's wife is upheld by Curley's jealousy, which causes all the ranch hands to avoid her. Crooks's barrier results from being barred from the bunkhouse by restraining him to the [[stable]]; his bitterness is partially broken, however, through Lennie's ignorance.\n\nSteinbeck's characters are often powerless, due to intellectual, economic, and social circumstances. Lennie possesses the greatest physical strength of any character, which should therefore establish a sense of respect as he is employed as a ranch hand. However, his intellectual handicap undercuts this and results in his powerlessness. Economic powerlessness is established as many of the ranch hands are victims of the [[Great Depression]]. As George, Candy and Crooks are positive, action- oriented characters, they wish to purchase a homestead, but because of the Depression, they are unable to generate enough money. Lennie is the only one who is basically unable to take care of himself, but the other characters would do this in the improved circumstances they seek. Since they cannot do so, the real danger of Lennie's mental handicap comes to the fore.\n\nRegarding human interaction, evil of oppression and abuse is a theme that is illustrated through Curley and Curley's wife. Curley uses his aggressive nature and superior position in an attempt to take control of his father's farm. He constantly reprimands the farm hands and accuses some of fooling around with his wife. Curley's [[Napoleon complex]] is evidenced by his threatening of the farm hands for minuscule incidents. Curley's wife, on the other hand, is not physically but verbally manipulative. She uses her sex appeal to gain some attention, flirting with the farm hands. According to the [[Penguin Group|Penguin]] Teacher's Guide for Of Mice and Men, Curley and Curley's wife represent evil in that both oppress and abuse the migrants in different ways.<ref>{{cite book|last=Reed, Ph.D|first=Arthea J.S.|title=A Teacher's Guide to the Penguin Edition of John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men|publisher=Penguin Group (USA)|url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/pdf/teachersguides/ofmiceandmen.pdf|access-date=2013-06-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916103326/http://us.penguingroup.com/static/pdf/teachersguides/ofmiceandmen.pdf|archive-date=2012-09-16|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nFate is felt most heavily as the characters' aspirations are destroyed when George is unable to protect Lennie (who is a real danger).

They hope to one day attain the dream of settling down on their own piece of land. Lennie's part of the dream is merely to tend and pet [[rabbit]]s on the farm, as he loves touching soft animals, although he always accidentally kills them. This dream is one of Lennie's favorite stories, which George constantly retells. They had fled from [[Weed, California|Weed]] after Lennie touched a young woman's dress and would not let go, leading to an accusation of [[rape]]. It soon becomes clear that the two are close and George is Lennie's protector, despite his antics.\n\nAfter being hired at a farm, the pair are confronted by Curley\u2014The Boss's small, aggressive son with a [[Napoleon complex]] who dislikes larger men, and starts to target Lennie. Curley's flirtatious and provocative wife, to whom Lennie is instantly attracted, poses a problem as well. In contrast, the pair also meets Candy, an elderly ranch handyman with one hand and a loyal dog, and Slim, an intelligent and gentle [[Muleteer|jerkline-skinner]] whose dog has recently had a [[Litter (animal)|litter]] of puppies. Slim gives a puppy to Lennie and Candy, whose loyal, accomplished sheep dog was [[Animal euthanasia|put down]] by fellow ranch-hand Carlson.\n\nIn spite of problems, their dream leaps towards reality when Candy offers to pitch in $350 with George and Lennie so that they can buy a farm at the end of the month, in return for permission to live with them. The trio are ecstatic, but their joy is overshadowed when Curley attacks Lennie, who defends himself by easily crushing Curley's fist while urged on by George.\n\nNevertheless, George feels more relaxed, to the extent that he even leaves Lennie behind on the ranch while he goes into town with the other ranch hands. Lennie wanders into the stable, and chats with Crooks, the bitter, yet educated stable buck, who is isolated from the other workers due to being black. Candy finds them and they discuss their plans for the farm with Crooks, who cannot resist asking them if he can hoe a garden patch on the farm albeit scorning its possibility. Curley's wife makes another appearance and flirts with the men, especially Lennie. However, her spiteful side is shown when she belittles them and threatens to have Crooks [[lynching|lynched]].\n\nThe next day, Lennie accidentally kills his puppy while stroking it. Curley's wife enters the barn and tries to speak to Lennie, admitting that she is lonely and how her dreams of becoming a movie star are crushed, revealing her personality. After finding out about Lennie's habit, she offers to let him stroke her hair, but panics and begins to scream when she feels his strength. Lennie becomes frightened, and unintentionally breaks her neck thereafter and runs away. When the other ranch hands find the corpse, George realizes that their dream is at an end. George hurries to find Lennie, hoping he will be at the meeting place they designated in case he got into trouble.\n\nGeorge meets Lennie at their camping spot before they came to the ranch. The two sit together and George retells the beloved story of the dream, knowing it is something they will never share. He then [[Involuntary euthanasia|euthanizes]] Lennie by shooting him, because he sees it as an action in Lennie's best interest. Curley, Slim, and Carlson arrive seconds after. Only Slim realizes what happened, and consolingly leads him away. Curley and Carlson look on, unable to comprehend the subdued mood of the two men.\n\n==Characters==\n\n* '''George Milton:''' A quick-witted man who is Lennie's guardian and best friend. His friendship with Lennie helps sustain his dream of a better future. He was bound in teasing Lennie since he was young. He is described by Steinbeck in the novel as \"small and quick,\" every part of him being \"defined,\" with small strong hands on slender arms. He has a dark face and \"restless eyes\" and \"sharp, strong features\" including a \"thin, bony nose.\"\n* '''Lennie Small''': A [[Developmental disability|mentally disabled]], but gigantic and physically strong man who travels with George and is his constant companion.<ref name=\"nyt-parini\">{{Cite journal|last=Parini|first=Jay|authorlink=Jay Parini|date=1992-09-27|title=FILM; Of Bindlestiffs, Bad Times, Mice and Men|journal=The New York Times|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE6DD1F3AF934A1575AC0A964958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all|accessdate=June 17, 2008}}</ref> He dreams of \"living off the fatta' the lan'\" and being able to tend to rabbits. His love for soft things conspires against him, mostly because he does not know his own strength, and eventually becomes his undoing. Steinbeck defines his appearance as George's \"opposite,\" writing that he is a \"huge man, shapeless of face, with large, pale eyes\" and \"wide, sloping shoulders.\" Lennie walks heavily, dragging his feet a little, \"the way a bear drags his paws,\" adding that his arms do not swing at his sides, but hang loosely.\n* '''Candy''': An aging ranch handyman, Candy lost his hand in an accident and worries about his future on the ranch. Fearing that his age is making him useless, he seizes on George\u2019s description of the farm he and Lennie will have, offering his life\u2019s savings if he can join George and Lennie in owning the land.\n* '''Slim''': A \"jerkline skinner,\" the main driver of a [[mule]] team and the \"prince of the ranch\". Slim is greatly respected by many of the characters and is the only character whom Curley treats with respect. His insight, intuition, kindness and natural authority draw the other ranch hands automatically towards him, and he is significantly the only character to fully understand the bond between George and Lennie.\n* '''Curley''': The Boss' son, a young, pugnacious character, once a semi-professional boxer. He is described by others, with some irony, as \"handy\", partly because he likes to keep a glove filled with [[vaseline]] on his left hand. He is very jealous and protective of his wife and immediately develops a dislike toward Lennie. At one point, Curley loses his temper after he sees Lennie appear to laugh at him, and ends up with his hand horribly damaged after Lennie fights back against him.\n* '''Curley's wife''': A young, pretty woman, who is mistrusted by her husband. The other characters refer to her only as \"Curley's wife\". Steinbeck explained that she is \"not a person, she's a symbol. She has no function, except to be a foil&nbsp;\u2013 and a danger to Lennie.\"<ref name=\"nyt-parini\" /> Curley's wife's preoccupation with her own beauty eventually helps precipitate her death: She allows Lennie to stroke her hair as an apparently harmless indulgence, only for her to upset Lennie when she yells at him to stop him 'mussing it'. Lennie tries to stop her yelling and eventually, and accidentally, kills her by breaking her neck.\n* '''Crooks''': Crooks, the black stable-hand, gets his name from his crooked back. Proud, bitter, and cynical, he is isolated from the other men because of the color of his skin. Despite himself, Crooks becomes fond of Lennie, and though he claims to have seen countless men following empty dreams of buying their own land, he asks Lennie if he can go with them and hoe in the garden.\n* '''Candy's dog''': A blind dog who is described as \"old\", \"stinky\", and \"crippled\", and is killed by Carlson.\n* '''Carlson''': A \"thick bodied\" ranch hand, he kills Candy's dog with little sympathy.\n* '''The Boss''': Curley's father, the superintendent of the ranch. The ranch is owned by \"a big land company\" according to Candy.\n* '''Whit''': A young ranch hand.\n\n==Themes==\n{{quotation|In every bit of honest writing in the world there is a base theme.

Candy aspires to reassert his responsibility lost with the death of his dog, and for security for his old age\u2014on George's homestead. Crooks aspires to a small homestead where he can express self-respect, security, and most of all, acceptance. Curley's wife dreams to be an actress, to satisfy her desire for fame lost when she married Curley, and an end to her loneliness.\n\nLoneliness is a significant factor in several characters' lives. Candy is lonely after his dog is gone. Curley's wife is lonely because her husband is not the friend she hoped for\u2014she deals with her loneliness by flirting with the men on the ranch, which causes Curley to increase his abusiveness and jealousy. The companionship of George and Lennie is the result of loneliness. Crooks states the theme candidly as \"A guy goes nuts if he ain't got anybody. Don't make any difference who the guy is, long's he's with you.\"<ref>Of Mice and Men, p. 71</ref> The author further reinforces this theme through subtle methods by situating the story near the town of [[Soledad, California|Soledad]], which means \"solitude\" in Spanish.<ref name=\"cliffnotebook\">{{cite book\n|last=Kirk\n|first=Susan Van\n|editor=Tracy Barr\n|editor2=Greg Tubach\n|title=Cliff Notes: On Steinbeck's Of Mice and men\n|origyear=2001\n|publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons|Wiley Publishing]]\n|location=909 Third Avenue, New York City, New York\n|isbn=0-7645-8676-9\n|year=2001\n|url-access=registration\n|url=https://archive.org/details/cliffsnotesofmic00vank\n}}</ref>\n\nDespite the need for companionship, Steinbeck emphasizes how loneliness is sustained through the barriers established from acting inhuman to one another. The loneliness of Curley's wife is upheld by Curley's jealousy, which causes all the ranch hands to avoid her. Crooks's barrier results from being barred from the bunkhouse by restraining him to the [[stable]]; his bitterness is partially broken, however, through Lennie's ignorance.\n\nSteinbeck's characters are often powerless, due to intellectual, economic, and social circumstances. Lennie possesses the greatest physical strength of any character, which should therefore establish a sense of respect as he is employed as a ranch hand. However, his intellectual handicap undercuts this and results in his powerlessness. Economic powerlessness is established as many of the ranch hands are victims of the [[Great Depression]]. As George, Candy and Crooks are positive, action- oriented characters, they wish to purchase a homestead, but because of the Depression, they are unable to generate enough money. Lennie is the only one who is basically unable to take care of himself, but the other characters would do this in the improved circumstances they seek. Since they cannot do so, the real danger of Lennie's mental handicap comes to the fore.\n\nRegarding human interaction, evil of oppression and abuse is a theme that is illustrated through Curley and Curley's wife. Curley uses his aggressive nature and superior position in an attempt to take control of his father's farm. He constantly reprimands the farm hands and accuses some of fooling around with his wife. Curley's [[Napoleon complex]] is evidenced by his threatening of the farm hands for minuscule incidents. Curley's wife, on the other hand, is not physically but verbally manipulative. She uses her sex appeal to gain some attention, flirting with the farm hands. According to the [[Penguin Group|Penguin]] Teacher's Guide for Of Mice and Men, Curley and Curley's wife represent evil in that both oppress and abuse the migrants in different ways.<ref>{{cite book|last=Reed, Ph.D|first=Arthea J.S.|title=A Teacher's Guide to the Penguin Edition of John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men|publisher=Penguin Group (USA)|url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/pdf/teachersguides/ofmiceandmen.pdf|access-date=2013-06-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916103326/http://us.penguingroup.com/static/pdf/teachersguides/ofmiceandmen.pdf|archive-date=2012-09-16|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nFate is felt most heavily as the characters' aspirations are destroyed when George is unable to protect Lennie (who is a real danger).

It was created on 5 December 1936 from the [[Kazakh Autonomous Socialist Soviet Republic|Kazakh ASSR]], an [[Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republics of the Soviet Union|autonomous republic]] of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]].\n\nAt {{convert|2717300|km2|sqmi}} in area, it was the second-largest republic in the USSR, after the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]]. Its capital was [[Almaty, Kazakhstan|Alma-Ata]] (today known as Almaty). Today it is the independent nation of [[Kazakhstan]]. During its existence as a Soviet Socialist Republic, it was ruled by the [[Communist Party of the Kazakh SSR]].\n\nOn 25 October 1990, the Supreme Soviet of the Kazakh SSR declared its sovereignty on its soil. [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]] was elected as president \u2013 a role he remained in for the next 29 years.\n\nThe Kazakh SSR was renamed the '''[[Republic of Kazakhstan]]''' on 10 December 1991, which declared its independence six days later, as the last republic to leave the USSR on 16 December 1991. The Soviet Union was [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|disbanded on 26 December 1991]] by the [[Soviet of Nationalities|Soviet of the Republics]]. The Republic of Kazakhstan, the legal successor to the Kazakh SSR, was admitted to the [[United Nations]] on 2 March 1992.\n\n==Name==\nThe country is named after the [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]] people, [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]-speaking former [[nomad]]s who sustained a powerful [[Kazakh Khanate|khanate]] in the region before [[Russian Empire|Russia]]n and later Soviet domination. The Soviet Union's [[spaceport]], now known as the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]], was located in this republic at [[Tyuratam]], and the secret town of [[Baikonur|Leninsk]] (now known as Baikonur) was constructed to accommodate its personnel.\n\n==History==\n===Formation===\nEstablished on August 26, 1920, it was initially called '''Kirghiz ASSR''' ([[Kirghiz Autonomous Socialist Soviet Republic (1920\u20131925)|Kirghiz Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]]) and was a part of the [[Russian SFSR]]. On April 15\u201319, 1925, it was renamed [[Kazak Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Kazak ASSR]] (subsequently '''Kazakh ASSR''') and on December 5, 1936 it was elevated to the status of a Union-level republic, '''Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic'''.\n\nBetween 1932 and 1933, as a consequence of enforced [[collectivisation]] and the disruption to the traditional nomadic lifestyle of many Kazakhs, [[Kazakhstan famine of 1932-1933|a famine struck]] Kazakhstan, killing 1,500,000 people during the catastrophe of whom 1,300,000 were ethnic Kazakhs.\n\nIn 1937 the first major [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|deportation of an ethnic group in the Soviet Union]] began, the [[Deportation of Koreans in the Soviet Union|removal of the Korean population]] from the [[Russian Far East]] to Kazakhstan. Over 170,000 people were forcibly relocated.\n\nOver one million political prisoners from various parts of the Soviet Union passed through the [[Karlag|Karaganda Corrective Labor Camp (KarLag)]] between 1931 and 1959, with an unknown number of deaths.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://thediplomat.com/2017/05/dark-tourism-in-kazakhstans-gulag-heartland/| author=Peter Ford| title=Dark Tourism in Kazakhstan's Gulag Heartland| publisher=The Diplomat| date=May 25, 2017}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, Soviet citizens were urged to settle in the [[Virgin Lands Campaign|Virgin Lands]] of the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic. The influx of [[immigrants]], mostly [[Russians]], skewed the ethnic mixture and enabled non-Kazakhs to outnumber natives.  As a result, the use of the Kazakh language declined, but has started to experience a revival since independence, both as a result of its resurging popularity in law and business and the growing proportion of Kazakhs. The other nationalities included [[Ukrainians]], [[Germans]], [[Jews]], [[Belarusians]], [[Koreans]] and others; Germans at the time of independence formed about 8% of the population, the largest concentration of Germans in the entire Soviet Union. Kazakh independence has caused many of these newcomers to emigrate.\n\n===Dissolution===\nFollowing the dismissal of [[Dinmukhamed Konayev]], the First Secretary of the [[Communist Party of Kazakhstan]] by the last Soviet leader, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], the riots broke out for four days between December 16 to December 19, 1986 known as [[Jeltoqsan]] by student demonstrators in Brezhnev Square in the capital city, [[Almaty|Alma-Ata]]. Approximately 168\u2013200 civilians were killed in the uprising. The events were then spilled over to [[Shymkent]], [[Pavlodar]], [[Karaganda]] and [[Taldykorgan]].\n\nOn March 25, 1990, Kazakhstan held its first elections with [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]], the chairman of the Supreme Soviet elected as its first president. Later that year on October 25, it then declared sovereignty. The republic participated in a [[1991 Soviet Union referendum|referendum]] to preserve the [[Union of Sovereign States|union in a different entity]] with 94.1% voted in favour. It did not happen when hardline communists in [[Moscow]] took [[1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|control of the government in August]]. Nazarbayev then condemned the failed coup.\n\nAs a result of those events, the Kazakh SSR was renamed to the '''[[Kazakhstan|Republic of Kazakhstan]]''' on December 10, 1991. It became independent on December 16 (the fifth anniversary of Jeltosqan), becoming the last republic to secede from the USSR. Its capital was the site of the [[Alma-Ata Protocol]] on December 21, 1991 that dissolved the Soviet Union and formed the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] in its place which Kazakhstan joined. The Soviet Union officially ceased to exist as a sovereign state on December 26, 1991 and Kazakhstan became an internationally recognized independent state.\n\nOn January 28, 1993, the new [[Constitution of Kazakhstan]] was officially adopted.\n\n==Population==\n[[File:Kazakhstan demographics 1897-1970 en.png|thumb|left|320px|Demographics of Kazakhstan from 1897\u20131970, with major ethnic groups.

It was created on 5 December 1936 from the [[Kazakh Autonomous Socialist Soviet Republic|Kazakh ASSR]], an [[Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republics of the Soviet Union|autonomous republic]] of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]].\n\nAt {{convert|2717300|km2|sqmi}} in area, it was the second-largest republic in the USSR, after the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]]. Its capital was [[Almaty, Kazakhstan|Alma-Ata]] (today known as Almaty). Today it is the independent nation of [[Kazakhstan]]. During its existence as a Soviet Socialist Republic, it was ruled by the [[Communist Party of the Kazakh SSR]].\n\nOn 25 October 1990, the Supreme Soviet of the Kazakh SSR declared its sovereignty on its soil. [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]] was elected as president \u2013 a role he remained in for the next 29 years.\n\nThe Kazakh SSR was renamed the '''[[Republic of Kazakhstan]]''' on 10 December 1991, which declared its independence six days later, as the last republic to leave the USSR on 16 December 1991. The Soviet Union was [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|disbanded on 26 December 1991]] by the [[Soviet of Nationalities|Soviet of the Republics]]. The Republic of Kazakhstan, the legal successor to the Kazakh SSR, was admitted to the [[United Nations]] on 2 March 1992.\n\n==Name==\nThe country is named after the [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]] people, [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]-speaking former [[nomad]]s who sustained a powerful [[Kazakh Khanate|khanate]] in the region before [[Russian Empire|Russia]]n and later Soviet domination. The Soviet Union's [[spaceport]], now known as the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]], was located in this republic at [[Tyuratam]], and the secret town of [[Baikonur|Leninsk]] (now known as Baikonur) was constructed to accommodate its personnel.\n\n==History==\n===Formation===\nEstablished on August 26, 1920, it was initially called '''Kirghiz ASSR''' ([[Kirghiz Autonomous Socialist Soviet Republic (1920\u20131925)|Kirghiz Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]]) and was a part of the [[Russian SFSR]]. On April 15\u201319, 1925, it was renamed [[Kazak Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Kazak ASSR]] (subsequently '''Kazakh ASSR''') and on December 5, 1936 it was elevated to the status of a Union-level republic, '''Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic'''.\n\nBetween 1932 and 1933, as a consequence of enforced [[collectivisation]] and the disruption to the traditional nomadic lifestyle of many Kazakhs, [[Kazakhstan famine of 1932-1933|a famine struck]] Kazakhstan, killing 1,500,000 people during the catastrophe of whom 1,300,000 were ethnic Kazakhs.\n\nIn 1937 the first major [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|deportation of an ethnic group in the Soviet Union]] began, the [[Deportation of Koreans in the Soviet Union|removal of the Korean population]] from the [[Russian Far East]] to Kazakhstan. Over 170,000 people were forcibly relocated.\n\nOver one million political prisoners from various parts of the Soviet Union passed through the [[Karlag|Karaganda Corrective Labor Camp (KarLag)]] between 1931 and 1959, with an unknown number of deaths.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://thediplomat.com/2017/05/dark-tourism-in-kazakhstans-gulag-heartland/| author=Peter Ford| title=Dark Tourism in Kazakhstan's Gulag Heartland| publisher=The Diplomat| date=May 25, 2017}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, Soviet citizens were urged to settle in the [[Virgin Lands Campaign|Virgin Lands]] of the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic. The influx of [[immigrants]], mostly [[Russians]], skewed the ethnic mixture and enabled non-Kazakhs to outnumber natives.  As a result, the use of the Kazakh language declined, but has started to experience a revival since independence, both as a result of its resurging popularity in law and business and the growing proportion of Kazakhs. The other nationalities included [[Ukrainians]], [[Germans]], [[Jews]], [[Belarusians]], [[Koreans]] and others; Germans at the time of independence formed about 8% of the population, the largest concentration of Germans in the entire Soviet Union. Kazakh independence has caused many of these newcomers to emigrate.\n\n===Dissolution===\nFollowing the dismissal of [[Dinmukhamed Konayev]], the First Secretary of the [[Communist Party of Kazakhstan]] by the last Soviet leader, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], the riots broke out for four days between December 16 to December 19, 1986 known as [[Jeltoqsan]] by student demonstrators in Brezhnev Square in the capital city, [[Almaty|Alma-Ata]]. Approximately 168\u2013200 civilians were killed in the uprising. The events were then spilled over to [[Shymkent]], [[Pavlodar]], [[Karaganda]] and [[Taldykorgan]].\n\nOn March 25, 1990, Kazakhstan held its first elections with [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]], the chairman of the Supreme Soviet elected as its first president. Later that year on October 25, it then declared sovereignty. The republic participated in a [[1991 Soviet Union referendum|referendum]] to preserve the [[Union of Sovereign States|union in a different entity]] with 94.1% voted in favour. It did not happen when hardline communists in [[Moscow]] took [[1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|control of the government in August]]. Nazarbayev then condemned the failed coup.\n\nAs a result of those events, the Kazakh SSR was renamed to the '''[[Kazakhstan|Republic of Kazakhstan]]''' on December 10, 1991. It became independent on December 16 (the fifth anniversary of Jeltosqan), becoming the last republic to secede from the USSR. Its capital was the site of the [[Alma-Ata Protocol]] on December 21, 1991 that dissolved the Soviet Union and formed the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] in its place which Kazakhstan joined. The Soviet Union officially ceased to exist as a sovereign state on December 26, 1991 and Kazakhstan became an internationally recognized independent state.\n\nOn January 28, 1993, the new [[Constitution of Kazakhstan]] was officially adopted.\n\n==Population==\n[[File:Kazakhstan demographics 1897-1970 en.png|thumb|left|320px|Demographics of Kazakhstan from 1897\u20131970, with major ethnic groups.

[[trismus]]. The spasms can also affect the facial muscles resulting in an appearance called ''[[risus sardonicus]]''. Chest, neck, back, abdominal muscles, and buttocks may be affected. Back muscle spasms often cause arching, called [[opisthotonos]].

Tracheotomy is recommended for securing the airway because the presence of an endotracheal tube is a stimulus for spasm\n* [[Magnesium sulfate]], as an intravenous (IV) infusion, to control spasm and  autonomic  dysfunction\n* Diazepam as a continuous IV infusion\n* The [[Autonomic nervous system|autonomic]] effects of tetanus can be difficult to manage (alternating hyper- and [[hypotension]] [[hyperpyrexia]]/[[hypothermia]]) and may require IV [[labetalol]], magnesium, [[clonidine]], or [[nifedipine]]\n\nDrugs such as diazepam or other [[muscle relaxant]]s can be given to control the muscle spasms. In extreme cases it may be necessary to paralyze the person with [[curare]]-like drugs and use a mechanical ventilator.\n\nIn order to survive a tetanus infection, the maintenance of an airway and proper [[nutrition]] are required. An intake of 3,500 to 4,000 calories and at least 150&nbsp;g of protein per day is often given in liquid form through a tube directly into the stomach ([[percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy]]), or through a drip into a vein ([[parenteral nutrition]]). This high-caloric diet maintenance is required because of the increased metabolic strain brought on by the increased muscle activity. Full recovery takes 4 to 6 weeks because the body must regenerate destroyed nerve [[axon]] terminals.\n\nThe antibiotic of choice is [[metronidazole]].

The etiology of the disease was further elucidated in 1884 by [[Antonio Carle]] and [[Giorgio Rattone]], two pathologists of the [[University of Turin]], who demonstrated the transmissibility of tetanus for the first time.

The heavy chain C-terminal domain aids in the binding to the correct site, recognizing and binding to the correct [[glycoprotein]]s and [[glycolipid]]s in the presynaptic membrane. The toxin binds to a site that will be taken into the neuron as an [[Endocytosis|endocytic vesicle]] that will travel all the way down the axon, past the cell body, and down the dendrites to the dendritic terminal at the spine and central nervous system.

The low pH of the vesicle lumen causes a conformational change in the toxin, shifting it from a water-soluble form to a [[Hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] form.<ref name=\":1\" /> With the hydrophobic patches exposed, the toxin is able to slide into the vesicle membrane. The toxin forms an [[ion channel]] in the membrane that is nonspecific for Na+, K+, Ba2+, and Cl- ions.<ref name=\":0\" /> There is a consensus among experts that this new channel is involved in the translocation of the toxin's light chain from the inside of the vesicle to the neuron cytosol, but the mechanism is not well understood or agreed upon.

The etiology of the disease was further elucidated in 1884 by [[Antonio Carle]] and [[Giorgio Rattone]], two pathologists of the [[University of Turin]], who demonstrated the transmissibility of tetanus for the first time. They produced tetanus in rabbits by injecting pus from a person with fatal tetanus into their sciatic nerves.<ref name=CDC2012Pink/>\n\nIn 1891, [[Clostridium tetani|''C.&nbsp;tetani'']] was isolated from a human victim by [[Kitasato Shibasabur\u014d]], who later showed that the organism could produce disease when injected into animals, and that the toxin could be neutralized by specific [[antibodies]]. In 1897, [[Edmond Nocard]] showed that tetanus antitoxin induced [[passive immunity]] in humans, and could be used for [[prophylaxis]] and treatment. Tetanus toxoid [[vaccine]] was developed by P.&nbsp;Descombey in 1924, and was widely used to prevent tetanus induced by battle wounds during [[World War II]].<ref name=CDC2012Pink/>\n\n===Etymology===\nThe word tetanus comes from the {{lang-grc|\u03c4\u03ad\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2|tetanos|taut}}, which is further from the {{lang-grc|\u03c4\u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd|teinein|to stretch}}.<ref>[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/Tetanus tetanus] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120626182039/http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/tetanus |date=2012-06-26 }}.
