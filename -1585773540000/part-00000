The ROC participates under this name in various international organizations and events, including the [[World Trade Organization]], the [[World Health Organization]], the [[Metre Convention]], [[FIRST Global]] and international pageants.\n\nThe term is [[Policy of deliberate ambiguity|deliberately ambiguous]]. To the PRC, \"Chinese [[Taipei]]\" is ambiguous about the political status or sovereignty of the ROC/Taiwan; to the ROC, it is a more inclusive term than just \"Taiwan\" (which to the [[Kuomintang]] of the ROC in power at the time, and the PRC, is just one part of \"China\", and both claim to be the rightful government of China in its entirety, and to the PRC the use of \"Taiwan\" as a national name is associated with independence of the area from the PRC) and \"[[Taiwan, China]]\" (might be construed as a subordinate area to the PRC).<ref name=\"Lin\">{{cite news |title=How 'Chinese Taipei' came about |author=Catherine K. Lin |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2008/08/05/2003419446 |newspaper=Taipei Times |date=5 August 2008}}</ref>\n\n== Origins ==\n{{See also|Two Chinas|Political status of Taiwan|Chinese Civil War|One-China policy}}\n{{Further|Names of China#Republic of China}}\n\nBefore the 1600s, the [[Geography of Taiwan|island of Taiwan]] had numerous independent [[Taiwanese Aborigines]] tribes, before being colonized by the [[Dutch Formosa|Dutch]] and [[Spanish Formosa|Spanish]] colonizers in the northern areas. Small portions of Taiwan were colonized by the Chinese and these few southern areas were governed by the [[Kingdom of Tungning]] before being [[Taiwan under Qing rule|annexed]] by the [[Qing dynasty]] in 1683. The central and mountainous areas were still under Indigenous control. Following the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] in 1895, [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Taiwan was annexed by]] [[Empire of Japan|Japan]].\n\nAfter the [[Surrender of Japan]] at the end of [[World War II]], the island of Taiwan was placed under the administration of Nationalist [[Republic of China (1912\u201349)|Republic of China]] (ROC) in 1945 and became [[Taiwan Province|their newest province]]. Near the end of [[Chinese Civil War]] in 1949, before the post-war treaties were to be signed, the [[Kuomintang]] were driven out of the [[Mainland China|mainland]] by the [[Communist Party of China|Communists]] who would later establish the [[China|People's Republic of China]] (PRC) in October 1949. The then ruling-party  [[Kuomintang]], however, retreated to the occupied Taiwan, thus becoming government in exile and remained for a time as the internationally recognized government of the [[Taiwan|Republic of China]]. Most republican countries (including the [[United States]]) initially continued to support the Nationalist government while communist nations recognized the Communist government.\n\nAs time went on, the increased official recognition of the PRC in international activities, such as when accorded [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758|recognition in 1971]] by the [[United Nations#Cold War era|United Nations]], instead of that accorded previously to the ROC saw previously existing diplomatic relations transfer from [[Taipei]] to [[Beijing]].<ref>Eyal Propper.

The [[Nagoya Resolution]] sanctioned that the Beijing Olympic Committee would be called the \"[[Chinese Olympic Committee]]\" and another name would need to be found for the ROC Olympic Committee (ROCOC).\n\nThe majority view of the ROC leadership at the time was that they did not want to change, \"Taiwan\" might imply without China or Chinese being in the name subordination to the PRC, did not represent all the regions/islands of the ROC and did not give the ROC an opportunity to assert when wanted a claim to territory outside of the ROC.<ref name=\"Lin\" />\n\nWhat people refer to as Taiwan is one of several areas or islands ([[Penghu]], [[Kinmen]] and [[Matsu Islands|Matsu]] in addition to [[Taiwan]]) and Taiwan alone did not reflect the \"territorial extent\" of the ROC. Furthermore, although it is true that most products from the [[Free area of the Republic of China|area controlled by the ROC]] are labeled \"made in Taiwan\", the trade practices of the ROC are such that the regional area of production is used for labeling. Some wines from Kinmen are labeled \"made in Kinmen\", just as some perfume is labeled \"made in Paris\" and not \"made in France\".<ref name=\"Lin\" />\n\nThe Chinese government in Taiwan, the ROC government under the [[Kuomintang|Kuomintang (KMT)]], rejected the designation of \"Taiwan, China\" on the grounds that this would imply subordination to the PRC.<ref name=\"Lin\" /> However, it also refused the names \"Taiwan\" and \"[[Formosa]] ({{zh|t=\u798f\u723e\u6469\u6c99|s=\u798f\u5c14\u6469\u6c99}})\" as a means of reasserting both its claim as the only legitimate government of all of China, and its uncompromising rejection of [[Taiwan independence]]. Instead, deriving from the name of its [[Taipei|capital city]], the ROC government finally formulated the name \u201cChinese Taipei,\u201d instead of accepting the offer of \u201cTaiwan,\u201d because \u201cChinese Taipei\u201d signified an uncertain boundary that could exceed the ROC\u2019s actual territory of control of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu, whenever the ROC government wished to assert it. It regarded the term ''Chinese Taipei'' as both acceptably neutral and hopeful of assent from other interested parties. Its proposal found agreement. Beijing accepted the compromise position that the ROC Olympic Committee could be named the ''\"[[Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee]]\"''.<ref name=\"Lin\" />\n\nIn April 1979, in a plenary session of the IOC, [[He Zhenliang]], a representative of the PRC, stated:\n\n<blockquote>According to the Olympic Charter, only one Chinese Olympic Committee should be recognized. In consideration of the athletes in Taiwan having an opportunity to compete in the Olympic Games, the sports constitution in Taiwan could function as a local organization of China and still remain in the Olympic Movement in the name of the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee. However, its anthem, flag and constitutions should be changed correspondingly.<ref>Brian B.

The Republic of China has competed under this flag and name exclusively at each [[Olympic Games|Games]] since the [[1984 Winter Olympics]], as well as at the [[Paralympics]] and at other international events (with the Olympic rings replaced by a symbol appropriate to the event).\n\n== Translation compromise ==\nBoth the [[Taiwan|Republic of China]] (ROC) and the [[China|People's Republic of China]] (PRC) agree to use the English name \"Chinese Taipei\". This is possible because of the ambiguity of the English word \"Chinese\", which may mean either the state ''or'' the culture. In 1979, the [[International Olympic Committee]] passed a resolution in [[Nagoya]], Japan, restoring the rights of the Chinese Olympic Committee within the IOC, meanwhile renaming the Taipei-based Olympic Committee \"Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee\". Since then, and until 1989 the [[China|PRC]] translated \"Chinese Taipei\" as \"Zhongguo Taipei\" ({{zh|s=\u4e2d\u56fd\u53f0\u5317|t=\u4e2d\u570b\u81fa\u5317|p=Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 T\u00e1ib\u011bi}}), similar to \"Zhongguo [[Hong Kong]]\", connoting that Taipei is a part of the Chinese state. By contrast, the [[Taiwan|Republic of China]] government translated it as \"[[Zhonghua minzu|Zhonghua]] Taipei\" ({{zh|s=\u4e2d\u534e\u53f0\u5317 |t=\u4e2d\u83ef\u81fa\u5317|p=Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 T\u00e1ib\u011bi}}) in Chinese, which references the term \"[[China]]\" as the cultural or ethnic entity, rather than the [[Sovereign state|state]]. In 1981 the former Republic of China Olympic Committee confirmed its acceptance of the Nagoya resolution, but translated \"Chinese Taipei\" to \"Zhonghua Taipei\". In 1989, the two Olympic committees signed a pact in [[Hong Kong]], clearly defining the use of \"Zhonghua Taipei\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2008-07/24/content_6871657.htm |title=Mainland plea to end Taiwan's name issue |publisher=China Daily |date=24 July 2008}}</ref> The PRC had been observing the [[Hong Kong]] pact and using \"Zhonghua Taipei\" in stipulated areas ever since, but on other occasions, the version of \"Zhongguo Taipei\" was still in use following past practice, especially in official media references.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newindpress.com/NewsItems.asp?ID=IEE20080724035229&Page=E&Title=Olympics+2008&Topic=0& |title=China clarifies Taiwan Olympics team name issue |publisher=New Ind Press |date=24 July 2008 }}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In the [[2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|London 2012 Olympic Games opening ceremony]], when each country's team proceeds in alphabetical order in English (the host country's language), the Chinese Taipei (TPE) team did not follow China (CHN), but instead took a place in the procession as if its name were \"Taipei\" or Taiwan, following Syria and preceding Tajikistan instead.

Stroke number is often used as the order to arrange teams and person's, akin to the use of alphabetical order in [[Roman script]]-based countries.\n\nOther East Asian nations have also had to make unique translation decisions. In Japan, the PRC is referred to by its official Japanese name ''Ch\u016bka Jinmin Ky\u014dwakoku'' ({{nihongo2|\u4e2d\u83ef\u4eba\u6c11\u5171\u548c\u56fd}}), but an English transliteration, ''Chain\u012bzu Taipei'' ({{nihongo2|\u30c1\u30e3\u30a4\u30cb\u30fc\u30ba\u30bf\u30a4\u30da\u30a4}}), is used for Chinese Taipei.

Small portions of Taiwan were colonized by the Chinese and these few southern areas were governed by the [[Kingdom of Tungning]] before being [[Taiwan under Qing rule|annexed]] by the [[Qing dynasty]] in 1683. The central and mountainous areas were still under Indigenous control. Following the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] in 1895, [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Taiwan was annexed by]] [[Empire of Japan|Japan]].\n\nAfter the [[Surrender of Japan]] at the end of [[World War II]], the island of Taiwan was placed under the administration of Nationalist [[Republic of China (1912\u201349)|Republic of China]] (ROC) in 1945 and became [[Taiwan Province|their newest province]]. Near the end of [[Chinese Civil War]] in 1949, before the post-war treaties were to be signed, the [[Kuomintang]] were driven out of the [[Mainland China|mainland]] by the [[Communist Party of China|Communists]] who would later establish the [[China|People's Republic of China]] (PRC) in October 1949. The then ruling-party  [[Kuomintang]], however, retreated to the occupied Taiwan, thus becoming government in exile and remained for a time as the internationally recognized government of the [[Taiwan|Republic of China]]. Most democratic countries (including the [[United States]]) initially continued to support the Nationalist government while communist nations recognized the Communist government.\n\nAs time went on, the increased official recognition of the PRC in international activities, such as when accorded [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758|recognition in 1971]] by the [[United Nations#Cold War era|United Nations]], instead of that accorded previously to the ROC saw previously existing diplomatic relations transfer from [[Taipei]] to [[Beijing]].<ref>Eyal Propper.

The [[Nagoya Resolution]] sanctioned that the Beijing Olympic Committee would be called the \"[[Chinese Olympic Committee]]\" and another name would need to be found for the ROC Olympic Committee (ROCOC).\n\nThe majority view of the ROC leadership at the time was that they did not want to change, \"Taiwan\" might imply without China or Chinese being in the name subordination to the PRC, did not represent all the regions/islands of the ROC and did not give the ROC an opportunity to assert when wanted a claim to territory outside of the ROC.<ref name=\"Lin\" />\n\nWhat people refer to as Taiwan is one of several areas or islands ([[Penghu]], [[Kinmen]] and [[Matsu Islands|Matsu]] in addition to [[Taiwan]]) and Taiwan alone did not reflect the \"territorial extent\" of the ROC. Furthermore, although it is true that most products from the [[Free area of the Republic of China|area controlled by the ROC]] are labeled \"made in Taiwan\", the trade practices of the ROC are such that the regional area of production is used for labeling. Some wines from Kinmen are labeled \"made in Kinmen\", just as some perfume is labeled \"made in Paris\" and not \"made in France\".<ref name=\"Lin\" />\n\nTaiwan's own government, the ROC government under the [[Kuomintang|Kuomintang (KMT)]], rejected the designation of \"Taiwan, China\" on the grounds that this would imply subordination to the PRC.<ref name=\"Lin\" /> However, it also refused the names \"Taiwan\" and \"[[Formosa]] ({{zh|t=\u798f\u723e\u6469\u6c99|s=\u798f\u5c14\u6469\u6c99}})\" as a means of reasserting both its claim as the only legitimate government of all of China, and its uncompromising rejection of [[Taiwan independence]]. Instead, deriving from the name of its [[Taipei|capital city]], the ROC government finally formulated the name \u201cChinese Taipei,\u201d instead of accepting the offer of \u201cTaiwan,\u201d because \u201cChinese Taipei\u201d signified an uncertain boundary that could exceed the ROC\u2019s actual territory of control of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu, whenever the ROC government wished to assert it. It regarded the term ''Chinese Taipei'' as both acceptably neutral and hopeful of assent from other interested parties. Its proposal found agreement. Beijing accepted the compromise position that the ROC Olympic Committee could be named the ''\"[[Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee]]\"''.<ref name=\"Lin\" />\n\nIn April 1979, in a plenary session of the IOC, [[He Zhenliang]], a representative of the PRC, stated:\n\n<blockquote>According to the Olympic Charter, only one Chinese Olympic Committee should be recognized. In consideration of the athletes in Taiwan having an opportunity to compete in the Olympic Games, the sports constitution in Taiwan could function as a local organization of China and still remain in the Olympic Movement in the name of the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee.

This is possible because of the ambiguity of the English word \"Chinese\", which may mean either the state ''or'' the culture. In 1979, the [[International Olympic Committee]] passed a resolution in [[Nagoya]], Japan, restoring the rights of the Chinese Olympic Committee within the IOC, meanwhile renaming the Taipei-based Olympic Committee \"Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee\". Since then, and until 1989 the [[China|PRC]] translated \"Chinese Taipei\" as \"Zhongguo Taipei\" ({{zh|s=\u4e2d\u56fd\u53f0\u5317|t=\u4e2d\u570b\u81fa\u5317|p=Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 T\u00e1ib\u011bi}}), similar to \"Zhongguo [[Hong Kong]]\", connoting that Taipei is a part of the Chinese state.

In 1981 the former Republic of China Olympic Committee confirmed its acceptance of the Nagoya resolution, but translated \"Chinese Taipei\" to \"Zhonghua Taipei\". In 1989, the two Olympic committees signed a pact in [[Hong Kong]], clearly defining the use of \"Zhonghua Taipei\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2008-07/24/content_6871657.htm |title=Mainland plea to end Taiwan's name issue |publisher=China Daily |date=24 July 2008}}</ref> The PRC had been observing the [[Hong Kong]] pact and using \"Zhonghua Taipei\" in stipulated areas ever since, but on other occasions, the version of \"Zhongguo Taipei\" was still in use following past practice, especially in official media references.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newindpress.com/NewsItems.asp?ID=IEE20080724035229&Page=E&Title=Olympics+2008&Topic=0& |title=China clarifies Taiwan Olympics team name issue |publisher=New Ind Press |date=24 July 2008 }}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In the [[2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|London 2012 Olympic Games opening ceremony]], when each country's team proceeds in alphabetical order in English (the host country's language), the Chinese Taipei (TPE) team did not follow China (CHN), but instead took a place in the procession as if its name were \"Taipei\" or Taiwan, following Syria and preceding Tajikistan instead.

The ships were the largest and most powerful warships built for the ''Kriegsmarine''; displacing more than {{convert|41000|MT|LT}} normally, they were armed with a battery of eight {{convert|38|cm|abbr=on}} guns and were capable of a top speed of {{convert|30|kn|lk=in}}. {{ship|German battleship|Bismarck||2}} was laid down in July 1936 and completed in September 1940, while her sister {{ship|German battleship|Tirpitz||2}}{{'}}s keel was laid in October 1936 and work finished in February 1941. The ships were ordered in response to the French {{sclass-|Richelieu|battleship|1}}s and they were designed with the traditional role of engaging enemy battleships in home waters in mind, though the German naval command envisioned employing the ships as long-range commerce raiders against British shipping in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. As such, their design represented strategic confusion that dominated German naval construction in the 1930s.\n\nBoth ships had short service careers. ''Bismarck'' conducted only one operation, [[Operation Rhein\u00fcbung]], a sortie into the North Atlantic to raid supply [[convoy]]s sent from North America to Great Britain. During the operation, she destroyed the British [[battlecruiser]] {{HMS|Hood|51|6}} and damaged the new battleship {{HMS|Prince of Wales|53|2}} in the [[Battle of the Denmark Strait]]. ''Bismarck'' was defeated and sunk in a [[Last battle of the battleship Bismarck|final engagement]] after a three-day chase by the [[Royal Navy]]. Disagreements over the cause of the sinking persist with chiefly British sources claiming responsibility for the sinking of the ship. Evidence reviewed by [[Robert Ballard]] and [[James Cameron]] indicates that her loss was most likely due to [[scuttling]] as originally claimed by her surviving crew-members.\n\n''Tirpitz''{{'}}s career was less dramatic; she operated in the [[Baltic Sea]] briefly in 1941 before being sent to Norwegian waters in 1942, where she acted as a [[fleet in being]], threatening the convoys from Britain to the Soviet Union. She was [[List of Allied attacks on the German battleship Tirpitz|repeatedly attacked]] by the Royal Navy and [[Royal Air Force]] between 1942 and 1944, but she was not seriously damaged in these attacks. In 1944, [[Avro Lancaster|Lancaster bombers]] hit the ship with two [[Tallboy bomb]]s, which caused extensive internal damage and [[capsize]]d the battleship. ''Tirpitz'' was broken up for scrap between 1948 and 1957.\n\n== Design ==\nA series of conceptual designs was begun by the ''[[Reichsmarine]]'' (Navy of the Realm) in 1932 to determine the ideal characteristics of a battleship built to the {{convert|35000|LT|abbr=on}} limit of the [[Washington Naval Treaty]]. These early studies determined that the ship should be armed with eight {{convert|33|cm|in|abbr=on}} guns, have a top speed of {{convert|30|kn}}, and have strong armor protection.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=203}} At the time, the German Navy was constrained by the terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] that had ended [[World War I]], which restricted battleships to a maximum displacement of {{convert|10000|LT}}. The design work for what became the ''Bismarck'' class was begun in 1933 and continued until 1936.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=33}} During this period, the naval leadership grappled with a variety of problems, including the strategic and operational use of such a ship and the preferred propulsion system. War games suggested that the new battleships could be used both to attack French shipping at long range and to fight in a traditional battle against the French and Polish navies, then seen as the most likely threats.{{sfn|Mulligan|pp=1021\u20131023}} Due to the numerical inferiority of the German fleet and the assumption that naval battles would take place at relatively close range in the [[North Sea]], the design staff placed great emphasis on stability and armor protection. Very thick vertical [[belt armor]] was adopted, along with heavy upper-citadel armor plating and extensive splinter protection in the bow and stern of the ships.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=204\u2013205}}\n\n[[File:Richelieu-2.jpg|thumb|left|The French battleship {{ship|French battleship|Richelieu||2}} in Dakar in 1940; the ''Bismarck''-class battleships were ordered to counter ''Richelieu'']]\n\nThe ''Reichsmarine'' learned in June 1934 that Italy had decided to build a pair of 35,000-ton battleships armed with {{convert|35|cm|abbr=on}} guns, which would surely provoke the construction of similar ships for the French fleet. To keep pace with their French rivals, the next two battleships built by Germany would need to be of a similar size and armament. At the same time, Germany was preparing to begin negotiations with Great Britain to secure a bilateral naval agreement that would effectively abrogate the naval restrictions of the Versailles treaty. In exchange, Germany would limit its fleet to a third the size of the [[Royal Navy]]. With the construction of at least two 35,000-ton battleships within reach, the German naval design staff began work in late October to lay out requirements for armament, armor, and speed. A preliminary design was completed in November, which resulted in a ship armed with eight 33&nbsp;cm guns in four twin [[gun turret]]s, protected an [[armored belt]] that was {{convert|350|mm|abbr=on}} thick, and capable of a top speed of {{convert|30|kn|lk=in}}. The staff noted that such a ship would likely exceed the 35,000-ton limit, so triple or quadruple turrets should be considered to reduce the weight.{{sfn|Mulligan|pp=1023\u20131026}}\n\nThe design staff had decided that four twin turrets would provide the best solution to distribution of the main battery, as it would provide equal firepower forward and aft, as well as simplify fire control. This arrangement was similar to the last German battleships of the [[German Empire|Imperial period]], the {{sclass-|Bayern|battleship|4}}. The similarity led to speculation that the ''Bismarck''s were essentially copies of the earlier ships, though the arrangement of the main battery was the only shared trait, along with a three-shaft propulsion system.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=204}} As design work continued into January 1935, ''[[Generaladmiral]]'' (General Admiral) [[Erich Raeder]], the commander of the ''Reichsmarine'', met with the various department and section leaders to refine the design requirements. The Naval Ordnance Department argued for an increase to 35&nbsp;cm guns to keep parity with the expected Italian and French ships, which Raeder approved on 19 January. Another meeting in March saw the Ordnance Department raise the possibility of increasing the projected main battery again to {{convert|38|cm|abbr=on}}, though Raeder initially rejected the idea owing to the significant increase in displacement. Nevertheless, though he formally approved the 35&nbsp;cm version on 1 April, he allowed for the option to increase the main battery depending on foreign developments. Just a month later, Raeder decided to adopt the larger gun on 9 May, largely the result of Chancellor [[Adolf Hitler]]'s preference for the 38&nbsp;cm gun.{{sfn|Mulligan|pp=1026\u20131028}}\n\nIn June 1935, Germany signed the [[Anglo-German Naval Agreement]], which allowed Germany to build battleships at a ratio of 35&nbsp;percent to the total tonnage of the Royal Navy;{{sfn|Maiolo|pp=35\u201336}} this granted Germany effective parity with France, at least in terms of allotted tonnage.{{sfn|Mulligan|p=1028}} It also made Germany party to the international treaty system begun at the [[Washington Naval Conference|Washington Conference]].{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=203}} By this time, the only significant issue to be settled was the propulsion system, which was largely dependent on strategic questions. Many senior officers in the navy envisioned using the ''Bismarck'' class in the [[Atlantic Ocean]], which would require a long cruising range.{{sfn|Mulligan|pp=1028\u20131031}} The naval constructors examined [[diesel engine]]s, [[steam turbine]]s, and turbo-electric drive engines; the last system was the preferred choice, as it had been extremely successful in the two American {{sclass-|Lexington|aircraft carrier|2}}s and the French passenger ship {{SS|Normandie||2}}.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=204}} The design staff were also required to provide sufficient range to the new battleships; they would have to make long voyages from German ports to reach the Atlantic, and Germany had no overseas bases where the ships could refuel.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=205\u2013206}} Raeder ordered the turbo-electric engines for the new ships, but the contracting manufacturer, [[Siemens-Schuckert]], could not meet the navy's requirements and removed itself from the project less than a month before construction on ''Bismarck'' began, forcing the navy to revert to high-pressure steam turbines.{{sfn|Mulligan|p=1031}}\n\n[[File:Tirpitz-1.jpg|thumb|Recognition drawing prepared by the US Navy]]\n\nThe displacement of ''Bismarck'' and ''Tirpitz'' was ultimately limited by the capabilities of existing infrastructure in [[Kiel]] and [[Wilhelmshaven]], and the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Canal]], rather than international agreements. On 11 February 1937, the Construction Office informed Raeder that the ships could not displace more than {{convert|42000|LT|abbr=on}} due to harbor constraints and canal depths. The office also expressed a preference for building a third vessel and remaining within the 35,000-ton treaty limit.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=206}} Admiral Werner Fuchs, the head of the General Command Office of the [[Oberkommando der Marine]], advised Raeder and Hitler that modifications would be necessary to reduce the displacement to ensure the new ships met the legal requirements of the [[London Naval Treaty]]. Japan refused to sign the new treaty, and so on 1 April 1937 an [[escalator clause]] permitting treaty signatories to build ships up to a limit of {{convert|45000|LT|abbr=on}} went into effect. The final design displacement of {{convert|41400|LT|abbr=on}} was well within this limit, so Fuchs's modifications were discarded.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=208}}\n\nDespite the fact that Raeder and other senior naval officers envisioned using ''Bismarck'' and ''Tirpitz'' as commerce raiders against first French and later British shipping in the Atlantic, and in fact used them in that role during [[World War II]], the ships were not designed for that mission. Their steam turbines did not afford the necessary cruising radius for such a role, and many of the decisions made for the ships' armament and armor layout reflect the expectation to fight a traditional naval battle at relatively close range in the North Sea. The disconnect between how ''Bismarck'' and ''Tirpitz'' were designed and how they were ultimately used represents the strategic incoherence that dominated German naval construction in the 1930s.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=204\u2013205}}{{sfn|Mulligan|pp=1042\u20131043}}\n\n=== General characteristics ===\nThe ''Bismarck''-class battleships were {{convert|251|m|ftin|abbr=on}} long [[Length overall|overall]] and {{convert|241.60|m|ftin|abbr=on}} long [[Length at the waterline|at the waterline]]. The ships had a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|36|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a designed [[Draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|9.30|m|ftin|abbr=on}}; the draft at standard [[Displacement (ship)|displacement]] was {{convert|8.63|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and {{convert|9.90|m|ftin|abbr=on}} at a full load. The ships had a designed displacement of {{convert|45950|MT|LT|lk=on}}; ''Bismarck''{{'}}s standard displacement was {{convert|41700|MT|LT|sp=us|abbr=on}}, and when fully laden, the ship displaced {{convert|50300|MT|LT|sp=us|abbr=on}}. ''Tirpitz'' was heavier, displacing {{convert|42900|MT|LT|abbr=on}} and {{convert|52600|MT|LT|abbr=on|sp=us}}, respectively. The ships had a [[double bottom]] for 83&nbsp;percent of the length of the hull, and twenty-two [[watertight compartment]]s. The ships were 90&nbsp;percent welded construction.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=33}} The stern was weakly constructed; this had significant consequences on ''Bismarck''{{'}}s only combat mission.{{sfn|Preston|p=151}}\n\nThe ships were very stable, primarily because of their wide beam. The ships suffered from only slight pitching and rolling, even in the heavy seas of the North Atlantic. ''Bismarck'' and ''Tirpitz'' were responsive to commands from the helm; they were capable of maneuvering with [[rudder]] deflections as small as 5\u00b0. With the rudder completely over, the ships heeled only 3\u00b0, but lost up to 65% of their speed. The ships handled poorly at low speeds or when traveling astern. As a result, tugs were necessary in confined areas to avoid collisions or grounding. The ships had a standard crew of 103 officers and 1,962 enlisted sailors. The ships carried smaller boats, including three picket boats, four barges, one [[Launch (boat)|launch]], two [[pinnace (ship's boat)|pinnaces]], two [[Cutter (boat)|cutters]], two [[yawl]]s, and two [[Dinghy|dinghies]].{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=35}}\n\n=== Propulsion ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 193-30-5-31A, Schlachtschiff Bismarck.jpg|thumb|''Bismarck'' in drydock, showing the three-shaft arrangement]]\n\nThe ''Bismarck''-class ships both had three sets of geared turbine engines; ''Bismarck'' was equipped with [[Blohm & Voss]] turbines, while ''Tirpitz'' used [[Brown, Boveri & Cie|Brown, Boveri, and Co.]] engines. Each set of turbines drove a 3-bladed [[propeller|screw]] that was {{convert|4.70|m|ftin|abbr=on}} in diameter. The three-shaft arrangement was chosen over a four-shaft system, as was typically used on foreign capital ships, since it would save weight. At a full load, the high and medium-pressure turbines ran at 2,825&nbsp;[[revolutions per minute|rpm]], while the low-pressure turbines ran at 2,390&nbsp;rpm. The ships' turbines were powered by twelve Wagner ultra high-pressure, oil-burning [[water-tube boiler]]s. ''Bismarck'' and ''Tirpitz'' were originally intended to use electric-transmission turbines that would have produced {{convert|46000|shp|abbr=on}} apiece. These engines would have provided for a higher top speed, but at the cost of greater weight. The geared turbines were significantly lighter, and as a result had a slight performance advantage. The geared turbines also had a significantly more robust construction, and so they were adopted instead.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|pp=33\u201335}}{{sfn|Mulligan|p=1026}}\n\nBoth ships were rated for a top speed of {{convert|30|kn}}; ''Bismarck'' just exceeded this speed on [[sea trials]], reaching {{convert|30.01|kn}}, while ''Tirpitz'' made {{convert|30.8|kn}} on trials. This difference was largely the result of a significant increase in horsepower for ''Tirpitz'', which reached {{convert|163023|PS|shp kW|lk=on|abbr=on}}, compared to {{convert|150170|PS|shp|0|disp=number}} for ''Bismarck''. The two ships had different fuel stores; ''Bismarck'' was designed to carry 3,200&nbsp;tons of fuel oil, but could store up to 6,400&nbsp;tons of fuel in a normal configuration; with extra fuel bunkers, the fuel carried could be increased up to 7,400&nbsp;tons. ''Tirpitz'' was designed to carry 3,000&nbsp;tons of fuel, and with additional bunkers, was able to store up to 7,780&nbsp;tons. At 19&nbsp;knots, ''Bismarck'' could steam for {{convert|8525|nmi|km}}, and ''Tirpitz'' had a maximum range of {{convert|8870|nmi|km}} at that speed.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=33}}\n\nRobert Ballard, the discoverer of ''Bismarck'', noted that the adoption of the three-shaft arrangement caused serious problems for ''Bismarck''. The center shaft weakened the keel, especially where it emerged from the hull. In addition to retaining greater hull strength, a four-shaft arrangement would have allowed a greater ability to steer the ship using only propeller revolutions than the three-screw system according to Ballard.{{sfn|Ballard|p=232}} During ''Bismarck''{{'}}s Atlantic operation in May 1941, the ship's rudder was disabled by a torpedo hit, and her course could not be corrected by altering screw revolutions;{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=234\u2013237}} this problem had already been revealed during sea trials, but it could not be corrected.{{sfn|von M\u00fcllenheim-Rechberg|p=39}}\n\nElectric power was provided by a variety of generators, including eight 500&nbsp;kW diesel generators arranged in four pairs, five 690&nbsp;kW turbo-generators, and one 460&nbsp;kW generator, the last of which was connected to a 400&nbsp;k[[Volt-ampere|VA]] [[alternating current|AC]] generator. Another 550&nbsp;kVA diesel generator provided additional AC power. The electrical plant provided a total 7,910&nbsp;kW at 220&nbsp;volts.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=35}}\n\n=== Armament ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 193-05-2-07A, Schlachtschiff Bismarck.jpg|thumb|''Bismarck''{{'}}s forward main battery [[gun turret|turret]]]]\n\n==== Main battery ====\n''Bismarck''{{'}}s and ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s main battery consisted of eight [[38 cm SK C/34 naval gun|{{convert|38|cm|in|abbr=on}} SK C/34]] guns in four twin turrets, ''Anton'' and ''Bruno'' in a superfiring pair forward of the [[superstructure]] and ''Caesar'' and ''Dora'' aft.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|pp=34\u201335}} The turrets allowed elevation to 30\u00b0, which gave the guns a maximum range of {{convert|36520|m|yd|abbr=on}}. The guns fired {{convert|800|kg|lb|abbr=on}} projectiles at a [[muzzle velocity]] of 820&nbsp;meters per second (2,690&nbsp;ft/s).{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=275}} The main battery was supplied with between 940\u2013960 shells total, for approximately 115\u2013120 shells per gun.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=35}} As with other German large-caliber naval rifles, these guns were designed by [[Krupp]] and featured sliding wedge breech blocks, which required brass cartridge cases for the propellant charges. Under optimal conditions, the rate of fire was one shot every 18 seconds, or three per minute.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=274}} The gun turrets were electrically trained and the guns were hydraulically elevated. Gun elevation was controlled remotely. The turrets required each gun to return to 2.5\u00b0 elevation for loading.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=278}} ''Tirpitz'' was eventually provided with time-fuzed shells to combat the repeated Allied bombing attacks.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=279}}\n\nThe ''Bismarck''s' use of four twin turrets (the 4 \u00d7 2 configuration) was a design practice that hearkened back to the First World War. Almost all other post-1921 capital ships had triple or even quadruple turrets, which allowed for additional heavy caliber guns, while reducing the number of turrets. Fewer turrets reduced the length of the battleship's armored citadel (particularly magazine length and the armor needed to protect it) and shortened the vessel itself. Although triple turrets were considered for the ''Bismarck''s, there were concerns that the extra barrel would lower the overall rate of fire in each turret, along with fears that a single well-aimed hit could disable a larger proportion of the ship's firepower. It was also felt that four twin turrets allowed for a better field of fire and a more effective sequence of salvos.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=33}}\n\n==== Secondary battery ====\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 193-06-7-16, Schlachtschiff Bismarck.jpg|thumb|One of ''Bismarck''{{'}}s 15&nbsp;cm gun turrets]]\nThe ships' secondary battery consisted of twelve [[15 cm SK C/28|{{convert|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} SK C/28]] guns mounted in six twin turrets.{{sfn|Sturton|p=44}} The 15&nbsp;cm gun turrets were based on the single-gun turrets used aboard the ''Scharnhorst'' class. They could elevate to 40\u00b0 and depress to \u221210\u00b0; they had a rate of fire of around six shots per minute.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=279}} The 15&nbsp;cm guns fired a {{convert|45.3|kg|lb|abbr=on}} shell at a muzzle velocity of 875&nbsp;m/s (2,871&nbsp;ft/s). At maximum elevation, the guns could hit targets out to {{convert|23000|m|yd|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=275}} As with the main battery guns, ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s 15&nbsp;cm guns were later supplied with time-fused shells.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=279}}\n\nThe decision to mount low-angle 15&nbsp;cm guns has been criticized by naval historians, including [[Antony Preston]], who stated that they \"imposed a severe weight penalty\", while American and British battleships were being armed with dual-purpose guns.{{sfn|Preston|p=152}} Naval historians William Garzke and Robert Dulin note that \"the use of dual-purpose armament would have possibly increased the number of anti-aircraft guns, but might have weakened the defence against destroyer attack, which German naval experts deemed more important.\"{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=297}}\n\n==== Anti-aircraft battery ====\nAs built, ''Bismarck'' and ''Tirpitz'' were equipped with an anti-aircraft battery of sixteen [[10.5 cm FlaK 38|{{convert|10.5|cm|in|sp=us|abbr=on}}]] C/33 65-caliber guns in eight twin mounts, sixteen [[3.7 cm SK C/30|{{convert|3.7|cm|in|sp=us|abbr=on}}]] C/30 guns in eight dual mounts, and twelve [[2 cm FlaK 30|{{convert|2|cm|in|sp=us|abbr=on}}]] C/30 guns in individual mounts.{{sfn|Sturton|p=44}} The 10.5&nbsp;cm guns were the same weapons as used aboard the ''Scharnhorst'' class, and were mounted on the first superstructure deck. After ''Bismarck'' was sunk in 1941, two amidships guns on ''Tirpitz'' were moved forward so as to provide them with better fields of fire. The sixteen guns were guided by four fire-control directors, two just aft of the [[conning tower]], a third positioned aft of the main mast, and the fourth directly behind turret Caesar. ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s directors were covered by protective domes, though ''Bismarck''{{'}}s were not.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=280}}\n\nThe ships' 37&nbsp;mm 83-caliber guns were twin mounted and placed in the superstructure. The mounts were hand-operated and automatically stabilized for roll and pitch.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=282}} These guns were supplied with a total of 32,000&nbsp;rounds of ammunition. ''Bismarck'' and ''Tirpitz'' were initially armed with twelve 20&nbsp;mm guns in single mounts, though these were augmented over time.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=35}} ''Bismarck'' received a pair of quadruple gun mountings, for a total of twenty 20&nbsp;mm guns. Over the course of her career, ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s 20&nbsp;mm battery was increased to 78 guns in single and quadruple mountings.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=282}}\n\n=== Armor ===\nThe ''Bismarck''-class ships had an armored belt that ranged in thickness from {{convert|220|to|320|mm|in|abbr=on}}; the thickest section of armor covered the central portion, where the gun turrets, ammunition magazines, and machinery spaces were located. This portion of the belt was capped on either end by 220&nbsp;mm thick transverse bulkheads. The ships had an upper deck that was {{cvt|50|mm|0}} thick, and an armored deck that was between {{cvt|100|to|120|mm}} thick amidships, and tapered down to {{convert|60|mm|in|abbr=on}} at the bow and {{convert|80|mm|in|abbr=on}} at the stern.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=33}} The deck was mounted low in the hull, however, which reduced the volume of internal space protected by the armored citadel. This contrasted with contemporary British and American designs that featured a single thick armored deck mounted high in the ship.{{sfn|Preston|p=151}}\n\nThe forward conning tower had a {{convert|200|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick roof and {{convert|350|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick sides, while the range finder had an armored roof 100&nbsp;mm thick and 200&nbsp;mm thick sides. The aft conning tower had much lighter armor: the roof was 50&nbsp;mm thick and the sides were {{convert|150|mm|in|abbr=on}}, while the aft range finder had a 50&nbsp;mm thick roof and 100&nbsp;mm sides. The main battery turrets were reasonably well-protected: the turret roofs were {{convert|130|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick, the sides were 220&nbsp;mm thick, and the faces were {{convert|360|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick with {{convert|220|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick shields.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=33}} These armor thicknesses were less than those of contemporary British ({{sclass-|King George V|battleship (1939)|5}}) and French (''Richelieu'') designs. Conversely, the secondary battery was better-protected than most rivals.{{sfn|Breyer, ''Battleships and Battle Cruisers''|p=300}} The 15&nbsp;cm gun turrets had {{convert|35|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick roofs, {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} sides, and 100&nbsp;mm fronts. The 10.5&nbsp;cm guns had {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} shields.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=33}}\n\n== Construction ==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv DVM 10 Bild-23-63-40, Schlachtschiff \"Tirpitz\", Stapellauf.jpg|thumb|''Tirpitz'' being launched]]\n\n''Bismarck'' was [[keel laying|laid down]] at the Blohm & Voss shipyard on 1 July 1936.{{sfn|Sturton|p=44}} The ship was assigned construction number 509, and the contract name ''Ersatz Hannover'', since she had been ordered as a replacement for the old battleship {{SMS|Hannover||2}}.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=33}} The ship was [[Ship launching|launched]] on 14 February 1939 with Adolf Hitler in attendance. The granddaughter of the ship's namesake, [[Otto von Bismarck]], christened the ship. As with other German capital ships, ''Bismarck'' was originally built with a straight bow. Experiences with other ships revealed the necessity of a [[clipper]] bow to prevent them from shipping too much water in heavy seas, so Blohm & Voss accordingly modified ''Bismarck''{{'}}s bow during the [[fitting-out]] process. The ship was commissioned into the fleet on 24 August 1940, with [[Kapit\u00e4n zur See]] [[Ernst Lindemann]] in command. Three weeks later, the ship left Hamburg for trials in the [[Baltic Sea]], before returning in December for final fitting-out work. Further trials and tests were conducted in the Baltic in March and April; ''Bismarck'' was placed on active status the following month.{{sfn|Williamson|pp=21\u201322}}\n\n''Tirpitz''{{'}}s keel was laid at the [[Kriegsmarinewerft Wilhelmshaven|''Kriegsmarinewerft'']] (Kriegsmarine Shipyard) in Wilhelmshaven on 20 October 1936,{{sfn|Sturton|p=44}} under construction number 128. She had been ordered under the contract name ''Ersatz Schleswig-Holstein'' to replace the obsolete battleship {{SMS|Schleswig-Holstein||2}}.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=33}} ''Tirpitz'' was named for Grand Admiral [[Alfred von Tirpitz]], the architect of the [[High Seas Fleet]] before World War I. His daughter, Frau von Hassel, christened the ship on 1 April 1939. Fitting out work lasted until February 1941;{{sfn|Williamson|p=35}} ''Tirpitz'' was commissioned into the fleet on 25 February.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=35}} A series of trials were then conducted, first in the North Sea and then in the Baltic.{{sfn|Williamson|pp=35\u201336}}\n\n== Ships ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! align = center|Ship\n! align = center|Builder\n! align = center|Namesake\n! align = center|Laid down\n! align = center|Launched\n! align = center|Commissioned\n! align = center|Fate\n|-\n|[[German battleship Bismarck|''Bismarck'']]\n|[[Blohm & Voss]],<br> [[Hamburg]]\n|[[Chancellor of Germany|''Reichskanzler'']] [[Otto von Bismarck|Otto, F\u00fcrst von Bismarck]]\n|1 July 1936\n|14 February 1939\n|24 August 1940\n|[[Last battle of the battleship Bismarck|Sunk following surface action]], 27 May 1941\n|-\n|[[German battleship Tirpitz|''Tirpitz'']]\n|[[Kriegsmarinewerft Wilhelmshaven|Kriegsmarinewerft]],<br> [[Wilhelmshaven]]\n|[[Grand admiral|''Gro\u00dfadmiral'']] [[Alfred von Tirpitz]]\n|2 November 1936\n|1 April 1939\n|25 February 1941\n|[[Operation Catechism|Sunk in air attack]] at [[Troms\u00f8]], 12 November 1944\n|}\n\n== Service history ==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 193-03-5-18, Schlachtschiff Bismarck.jpg|thumb|''Bismarck'' in September 1940]]\n\n=== ''Bismarck'' ===\n{{main|German battleship Bismarck}}\nAfter ''Bismarck'' joined the fleet, plans were drawn up for a sortie into the North Atlantic, which was codenamed [[Operation Rhein\u00fcbung|Operation ''Rhein\u00fcbung'']] (Rhine Exercise). The operation initially called for a force composed of ''Bismarck'', ''Tirpitz'', and the two {{sclass-|Scharnhorst|battleship|2}}s. ''Tirpitz'' was not yet ready for service by May 1941, and {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} was being overhauled. The force was reduced to ''Bismarck'', {{ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}}, and the heavy cruiser {{ship|German cruiser|Prinz Eugen||2}}. ''Gneisenau'' was damaged by a British bombing raid on [[Brest, France|Brest]], so it was decided that only ''Bismarck'' and ''Prinz Eugen'' would conduct the operation. Admiral [[G\u00fcnther L\u00fctjens]] was placed in command of the pair of ships.{{sfn|Williamson|p=22}}\n\nEarly on the morning of 19 May, ''Bismarck'' left [[Gotenhafen]], bound for the North Atlantic.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=63}} While on the trip through the [[Danish straits|Danish Belt]], ''Bismarck'' and ''Prinz Eugen'' encountered the Swedish cruiser {{HSwMS|Gotland|1933|6}} in [[Kattegat]]; the sighting was passed through the Swedish Navy to the British naval attach\u00e9 in Stockholm.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=65\u201367}} The British [[Royal Air Force]] conducted aerial reconnaissance of the Norwegian fjord in which ''Bismarck'' and ''Prinz Eugen'' had stopped, to confirm the sighting. While in Norway, Admiral L\u00fctjens failed to replenish the approximately {{convert|1000|LT|abbr=on}} of fuel ''Bismarck'' had spent on the first leg of the voyage.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=71}}\n\nBy 23 May, ''Bismarck'' and ''Prinz Eugen'' had reached the [[Denmark Strait]]. That evening, the British cruisers {{HMS|Suffolk|55|2}} and {{HMS|Norfolk|78|2}} briefly engaged ''Bismarck'' before dropping back to shadow the German ships.{{sfn|Williamson|p=23}} At 06:00 the following morning, observers aboard ''Bismarck'' spotted the masts of the battlecruiser {{HMS|Hood|51|2}} and the new battleship {{HMS|Prince of Wales|53|2}}.{{sfn|Williamson|pp=23\u201324}} The British ships steamed directly towards ''Bismarck'' and ''Prinz Eugen'', before attempting a turn to bring the two forces on a roughly parallel course. During the turn, at least one of ''Bismarck''{{'}}s 38&nbsp;cm shells penetrated one of the aft ammunition magazines aboard ''Hood'', which caused a catastrophic explosion and destroyed the ship.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=147\u2013153}} There were only three survivors from ''Hood''{{'}}s crew of 1,421. The German ships then concentrated their fire on ''Prince of Wales'', which was forced to withdraw. ''Bismarck'' did not emerge unscathed; a direct hit on her bow from ''Prince of Wales'' caused ''Bismarck'' to take in some {{convert|2000|LT|abbr=on}} of water. The ship was also leaking oil, which made it easier for the British to track her.{{sfn|Williamson|p=24}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1984-055-14, Schlachtschiff Bismarck, nach Seegefecht.jpg|thumb|left|''Bismarck'' after the battle with ''Hood'' and ''Prince of Wales'']]\n\nAfter retreating, ''Prince of Wales'' joined ''Norfolk'' and ''Suffolk''; the ships briefly engaged ''Bismarck'' at around 18:00. Neither side scored a hit.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=227}} By this time, 19 warships were involved in the chase.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=229}} This included six battleships and battlecruisers and two aircraft carriers, along with a number of cruisers and destroyers.{{sfn|Williamson|p=33}} After the second engagement with ''Prince of Wales'', L\u00fctjens detached ''Prinz Eugen'' to continue the operation while ''Bismarck'' sailed for port.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=176\u2013177}} Shortly before midnight on 24 May, a group of [[Fairey Swordfish]] torpedo bombers from [[825 Naval Air Squadron]] on {{HMS|Victorious|R38|2}} attacked ''Bismarck''. One torpedo struck the ship amidships, though without doing any serious damage. The shock from the explosion, coupled with ''Bismarck''{{'}}s maneuvering at high speed, damaged the temporary repairs that had stopped the flooding from the earlier battle damage. Her speed was reduced to {{convert|16|kn}} to slow the flooding while repair teams fixed the reopened wounds.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=229\u2013230}}\n\nEarly on 25 May, ''Bismarck'' doubled back past her pursuers in a wide circle. The maneuver successfully shook off the British ships, which turned west in an attempt to find the ship. Despite the maneuver, Admiral L\u00fctjens was unaware that he had evaded the British, and so sent a series of radio transmissions, which were intercepted by the British and used to gain a rough fix on his position.{{sfn|Williamson|p=33}} Due to the damage his ship had sustained, L\u00fctjens decided to head for occupied France rather than continue his mission. On the morning of 26 May, a Coastal Command [[PBY Catalina]] flying boat spotted ''Bismarck'' {{convert|690|nmi|abbr=on}} to the north-west of Brest; she was steaming at a speed that would put her under the protective umbrella of German aircraft and [[U-boat]]s within 24&nbsp;hours. The only British forces close enough to slow her down were the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Ark Royal|91|2}} and her escort, the battlecruiser {{HMS|Renown|1916|2}}.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=233}} At approximately 20:30, a flight of fifteen ''Ark Royal''{{'}}s [[820 Naval Air Squadron]]s Swordfish torpedo bombers launched an attack on ''Bismarck''. Three torpedoes were believed to have struck the ship; the first two torpedoes failed to do serious damage to the ship, but the third hit jammed ''Bismarck''{{'}}s rudders hard to starboard. The damage could not be repaired, and the battleship began turning in a large circle, back towards her pursuers.{{sfn|Williamson|p=33}}\n\nAn hour after the Swordfish attack, L\u00fctjens transmitted the following signal to Naval Group Command West: \"Ship unable to maneuver. We will fight to the last shell. Long live the F\u00fchrer.\"{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=266}} At 08:47 the following morning, the battleship {{HMS|Rodney|29|2}} opened fire, followed directly by {{HMS|King George V|41|2}}.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=288}} ''Bismarck'' replied three minutes later, though at 09:02 a 16-inch shell from ''Rodney'' destroyed the forward turrets.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=289\u2013290}} Half an hour later, ''Bismarck''{{'}}s rear turrets were silenced as well.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=291}} At around 10:15, both British battleships had ceased fire, their target a burning wreck. The British were running dangerously low on fuel, but ''Bismarck'' had not yet been sunk. The cruiser {{HMS|Dorsetshire|40|2}} fired several torpedoes into the crippled ship, which then took on a severe list to port. At approximately the same time as ''Dorsetshire''{{'}}s attack, engine room crew detonated scuttling charges in the engine rooms.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=245\u2013246}} There is still significant debate as to the direct cause of ''Bismarck''{{'}}s sinking. Only 110 men were rescued by the British before reports of U-boats forced them from the scene.{{sfn|Williamson|pp=34\u201335}} A further five men were rescued by German vessels.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=246}}\n\n=== ''Tirpitz'' ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J19316, Norwegen, Schlachtschiff, Zerst\u00f6rer.jpg|thumb|''Tirpitz'' and several destroyers off the Norwegian coast]]\n{{main|German battleship Tirpitz}}\n''Tirpitz''{{'}}s first action following her commissioning into the Kriegsmarine on 25 February 1941 was to act as a deterrent to a possible Soviet attempt to break out their [[Baltic Fleet]] following the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]]. The ship was joined by the heavy cruiser {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Scheer||2}} and the light cruisers {{ship|German cruiser|Leipzig||2}}, {{ship|German cruiser|N\u00fcrnberg||2}}, and {{ship|German cruiser|K\u00f6ln||2}}. The force patrolled off the [[\u00c5land Islands]] for a few days before returning to Kiel.{{sfn|Williamson|p=36}} On 14 January 1942, ''Tirpitz'' left German waters for Norway, arriving on the 17th.{{sfn|Breyer, ''\"Tirpitz\"''|p=25}} The Germans used the ship as a [[fleet in being]] to tie down British naval forces to protect the convoy route to the Soviet Union and to deter an invasion of Norway.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=248}}\n\nOn 6 March, ''Tirpitz'', escorted by three destroyers, launched a raid on the [[Arctic convoys of World War II|British convoys to the Soviet Union]].{{sfn|Williamson|p=36}} The Germans attempted to intercept convoys PQ-12 and QP-8,{{sfn|Breyer, ''\"Tirpitz\"''|p=25}} but the inclement weather prevented them from finding the convoys.{{sfn|Williamson|p=36}} The British located ''Tirpitz'', and the aircraft carrier ''Victorious'' launched a strike of twelve [[Fairey Albacore]] torpedo bombers. The aircraft were repulsed without having scored any hits on the German ships. ''Tirpitz'' and the destroyers were back in port by 12 March.{{sfn|Breyer, ''\"Tirpitz\"''|p=25}} The close call prompted Hitler to mandate that ''Tirpitz'' was not to attack another convoy unless its escorting aircraft carrier had been sunk or disabled.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=253}}\n\nOver the next two months, the RAF launched a series of unsuccessful bombing raids against ''Tirpitz'' while she was moored in the [[Faettenfjord]]. The first, by 34 [[Handley Page Halifax]] bombers, took place on 31 March. Two followed a month later, on 28 and 29 April. The first attack was conducted by 43 Halifax and [[Avro Lancaster]] bombers, the second by 34 Halifax and Lancaster.{{sfn|Breyer, ''\"Tirpitz\"''|p=25}} A combination of heavy German anti-aircraft fire and poor weather caused all three missions to fail.{{sfn|Williamson|p=36}} Over the rest of the year and into late 1942, ''Tirpitz'' underwent a refit in the Faettenfjord, which lacked dockyard facilities of any type. As a result, the work was done incrementally; a large [[Caisson (engineering)|caisson]] was built to allow the rudders to be replaced.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=255}} Naval historians William Garzke and Robert Dulin stated that \"the repairs to this ship were one of the most difficult naval engineering feats of World War II.\"{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=256}}\n\nIn January 1943, ''Tirpitz'' emerged from the lengthy overhaul, after which she was transferred to [[Altafjord]]. Here, she participated in extensive training operations with ''Scharnhorst'' and the heavy cruiser {{ship|German cruiser|L\u00fctzow|1940|2}}, which lasted until the middle of the year.{{sfn|Williamson|p=37}} In early September, ''Tirpitz'', ''Scharnhorst'', and ten destroyers bombarded the island of [[Spitzbergen]], which served as a British refuelling station. The two battleships destroyed their targets and returned safely to Altenfjord; this was the first time ''Tirpitz'' fired her main guns in anger.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=258}} On 22\u201323 September, six [[Operation Source|British midget submarines]] attacked ''Tirpitz'' while at anchor. Two of the submarines successfully planted explosive charges against the battleship's hull, which did serious damage. ''Tirpitz'' had been successfully neutralized.{{sfn|Williamson|p=37}} Over the next six months, a workforce of some 1,000 men effected the needed repairs, which were finished by March 1944.{{sfn|Williamson|pp=37\u201338}}\n\n[[File:Fleet Air Arm attack the battleship Tirpitz.jpg|thumb|left|''Tirpitz'' under attack by Barracuda bombers on 3 April]]\n\nThe British resumed the [[List of Allied attacks on the German battleship Tirpitz|series of air attacks]] almost immediately after repairs were completed. On 3 April, the Royal Navy launched [[Operation Tungsten]], during which 40&nbsp;fighters and 40&nbsp;[[Fairey Barracuda|Barracuda]] bombers from six carriers attacked the ship. They scored 15 direct hits and two near misses, which caused heavy damage, killed 122 men, and wounded 316 more. The Royal Navy attempted to repeat the attack three weeks later on the 24th, but had to call the operation off due to inclement weather. Operation Brawn, another carrier-launched attack, followed on 15 May, but again weather interfered. Another carrier strike was attempted on 28 May, but it too was cancelled due to poor weather conditions. [[Operation Mascot]], which was to be conducted by the carriers ''Victorious'', ''Furious'', and {{HMS|Indefatigable|R10|2}} on 17 July, was frustrated by the heavy smokescreen over the battleship.{{sfn|Breyer, ''\"Tirpitz\"''|p=26}}\n\nThe Royal Navy launched the [[Operation Goodwood (naval)|Operation Goodwood]] series in late August. Goodwood I took place on 22 August, with 38 bombers and 43 fighters from five carriers. The attackers failed to score any hits. Goodwood III followed two days later, with 48 bombers and 29 fighters from {{HMS|Formidable|67|2}}, ''Furious'', and ''Indefatigable''. The bombers made two hits on the ship, which did only minor damage. The last Royal Navy operation, Goodwood IV, followed on 29 August. Thirty-four bombers and 25 fighters, launched from ''Formidable'' and ''Indefatigable'', attacked the ship, though fog prevented them from scoring any hits.{{sfn|Breyer, ''\"Tirpitz\"''|p=26}}\n\nThe task of sinking ''Tirpitz'' now fell to the RAF, which performed three airstrikes armed with new {{convert|5400|kg|lb|abbr=on}} [[Tallboy bomb]]s.{{sfn|Breyer, ''\"Tirpitz\"''|p=26}} The first attack, [[Operation Paravane]], came on 15 September, when a force of 27 Lancasters dropped a single Tallboy each; the bombers succeeded in hitting ''Tirpitz'' directly in the bow with one of the bombs. The bomb completely penetrated the ship and exploded directly under her keel. This caused {{convert|1500|MT|abbr=on}} of water to flood the ship; ''Tirpitz'' had again been disabled.{{sfn|Williamson|p=39}} A month later, on 15 October, ''Tirpitz'' was moved to H\u00e5k\u00f8ya Island off [[Troms\u00f8]] to be used as a floating artillery battery. Two weeks later, on 29 October, the British launched [[Operation Obviate]], which consisted of 32 Lancaster bombers. Only a near miss was achieved, though it caused ''Tirpitz'' to take in more water.

The ships were the largest and most powerful warships built for the ''Kriegsmarine''; displacing more than {{convert|41000|MT|LT}} normally, they were armed with a battery of eight {{convert|38|cm|abbr=on}} guns and were capable of a top speed of {{convert|30|kn|lk=in}}. {{ship|German battleship|Bismarck||2}} was laid down in July 1936 and completed in September 1940, while her sister {{ship|German battleship|Tirpitz||2}}{{'}}s keel was laid in October 1936 and work finished in February 1941. The ships were ordered in response to the French {{sclass-|Richelieu|battleship|1}}s and they were designed with the traditional role of engaging enemy battleships in home waters in mind, though the German naval command envisioned employing the ships as long-range commerce raiders against British shipping in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. As such, their design represented strategic confusion that dominated German naval construction in the 1930s.\n\nBoth ships had short service careers. ''Bismarck'' conducted only one operation, [[Operation Rhein\u00fcbung]], a sortie into the North Atlantic to raid supply [[convoy]]s sent from North America to Great Britain. During the operation, she destroyed the British [[battlecruiser]] {{HMS|Hood|51|6}} and damaged the new battleship {{HMS|Prince of Wales|53|2}} in the [[Battle of the Denmark Strait]]. ''Bismarck'' was defeated and sunk in a [[Last battle of the battleship Bismarck|final engagement]] after a three-day chase by the [[Royal Navy]]. Disagreements over the cause of the sinking persist with chiefly British sources claiming responsibility for the sinking of the ship. Evidence reviewed by [[Robert Ballard]] and [[James Cameron]] indicates that her loss was most likely due to [[scuttling]] as originally claimed by her surviving crew-members.\n\n''Tirpitz''{{'}}s career was less dramatic; she operated in the [[Baltic Sea]] briefly in 1941 before being sent to Norwegian waters in 1942, where she acted as a [[fleet in being]], threatening the convoys from Britain to the Soviet Union. She was [[List of Allied attacks on the German battleship Tirpitz|repeatedly attacked]] by the Royal Navy and [[Royal Air Force]] between 1942 and 1944, but she was not seriously damaged in these attacks. In 1944, [[Avro Lancaster|Lancaster bombers]] hit the ship with two [[Tallboy bomb]]s, which caused extensive internal damage and [[capsize]]d the battleship. ''Tirpitz'' was broken up for scrap between 1948 and 1957.\n\n== Design ==\nA series of conceptual designs was begun by the ''[[Reichsmarine]]'' (Navy of the Realm) in 1932 to determine the ideal characteristics of a battleship built to the {{convert|35000|LT|abbr=on}} limit of the [[Washington Naval Treaty]]. These early studies determined that the ship should be armed with eight {{convert|33|cm|in|abbr=on}} guns, have a top speed of {{convert|30|kn}}, and have strong armor protection.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=203}} At the time, the German Navy was constrained by the terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] that had ended [[World War I]], which restricted battleships to a maximum displacement of {{convert|10000|LT}}. The design work for what became the ''Bismarck'' class was begun in 1933 and continued until 1936.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=33}} During this period, the naval leadership grappled with a variety of problems, including the strategic and operational use of such a ship and the preferred propulsion system. War games suggested that the new battleships could be used both to attack French shipping at long range and to fight in a traditional battle against the French and Polish navies, then seen as the most likely threats.{{sfn|Mulligan|pp=1021\u20131023}} Due to the numerical inferiority of the German fleet and the assumption that naval battles would take place at relatively close range in the [[North Sea]], the design staff placed great emphasis on stability and armor protection. Very thick vertical [[belt armor]] was adopted, along with heavy upper-citadel armor plating and extensive splinter protection in the bow and stern of the ships.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=204\u2013205}}\n\n[[File:Richelieu-2.jpg|thumb|left|The French battleship {{ship|French battleship|Richelieu||2}} in Dakar in 1940; the ''Bismarck''-class battleships were ordered to counter ''Richelieu'']]\n\nThe ''Reichsmarine'' learned in June 1934 that Italy had decided to build a pair of 35,000-ton battleships armed with {{convert|35|cm|abbr=on}} guns, which would surely provoke the construction of similar ships for the French fleet. To keep pace with their French rivals, the next two battleships built by Germany would need to be of a similar size and armament. At the same time, Germany was preparing to begin negotiations with Great Britain to secure a bilateral naval agreement that would effectively abrogate the naval restrictions of the Versailles treaty. In exchange, Germany would limit its fleet to a third the size of the [[Royal Navy]]. With the construction of at least two 35,000-ton battleships within reach, the German naval design staff began work in late October to lay out requirements for armament, armor, and speed. A preliminary design was completed in November, which resulted in a ship armed with eight 33&nbsp;cm guns in four twin [[gun turret]]s, protected an [[armored belt]] that was {{convert|350|mm|abbr=on}} thick, and capable of a top speed of {{convert|30|kn|lk=in}}. The staff noted that such a ship would likely exceed the 35,000-ton limit, so triple or quadruple turrets should be considered to reduce the weight.{{sfn|Mulligan|pp=1023\u20131026}}\n\nThe design staff had decided that four twin turrets would provide the best solution to distribution of the main battery, as it would provide equal firepower forward and aft, as well as simplify fire control. This arrangement was similar to the last German battleships of the [[German Empire|Imperial period]], the {{sclass-|Bayern|battleship|4}}. The similarity led to speculation that the ''Bismarck''s were essentially copies of the earlier ships, though the arrangement of the main battery was the only shared trait, along with a three-shaft propulsion system.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=204}} As design work continued into January 1935, ''[[Generaladmiral]]'' (General Admiral) [[Erich Raeder]], the commander of the ''Reichsmarine'', met with the various department and section leaders to refine the design requirements. The Naval Ordnance Department argued for an increase to 35&nbsp;cm guns to keep parity with the expected Italian and French ships, which Raeder approved on 19 January. Another meeting in March saw the Ordnance Department raise the possibility of increasing the projected main battery again to {{convert|38|cm|abbr=on}}, though Raeder initially rejected the idea owing to the significant increase in displacement. Nevertheless, though he formally approved the 35&nbsp;cm version on 1 April, he allowed for the option to increase the main battery depending on foreign developments. Just a month later, Raeder decided to adopt the larger gun on 9 May, largely the result of Chancellor [[Adolf Hitler]]'s preference for the 38&nbsp;cm gun.{{sfn|Mulligan|pp=1026\u20131028}}\n\nIn June 1935, Germany signed the [[Anglo-German Naval Agreement]], which allowed Germany to build battleships at a ratio of 35&nbsp;percent to the total tonnage of the Royal Navy;{{sfn|Maiolo|pp=35\u201336}} this granted Germany effective parity with France, at least in terms of allotted tonnage.{{sfn|Mulligan|p=1028}} It also made Germany party to the international treaty system begun at the [[Washington Naval Conference|Washington Conference]].{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=203}} By this time, the only significant issue to be settled was the propulsion system, which was largely dependent on strategic questions. Many senior officers in the navy envisioned using the ''Bismarck'' class in the [[Atlantic Ocean]], which would require a long cruising range.{{sfn|Mulligan|pp=1028\u20131031}} The naval constructors examined [[diesel engine]]s, [[steam turbine]]s, and turbo-electric drive engines; the last system was the preferred choice, as it had been extremely successful in the two American {{sclass-|Lexington|aircraft carrier|2}}s and the French passenger ship {{SS|Normandie||2}}.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=204}} The design staff were also required to provide sufficient range to the new battleships; they would have to make long voyages from German ports to reach the Atlantic, and Germany had no overseas bases where the ships could refuel.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=205\u2013206}} Raeder ordered the turbo-electric engines for the new ships, but the contracting manufacturer, [[Siemens-Schuckert]], could not meet the navy's requirements and removed itself from the project less than a month before construction on ''Bismarck'' began, forcing the navy to revert to high-pressure steam turbines.{{sfn|Mulligan|p=1031}}\n\n[[File:Tirpitz-1.jpg|thumb|Recognition drawing prepared by the US Navy]]\n\nThe displacement of ''Bismarck'' and ''Tirpitz'' was ultimately limited by the capabilities of existing infrastructure in [[Kiel]] and [[Wilhelmshaven]], and the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Canal]], rather than international agreements. On 11 February 1937, the Construction Office informed Raeder that the ships could not displace more than {{convert|42000|LT|abbr=on}} due to harbor constraints and canal depths. The office also expressed a preference for building a third vessel and remaining within the 35,000-ton treaty limit.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=206}} Admiral Werner Fuchs, the head of the General Command Office of the [[Oberkommando der Marine]], advised Raeder and Hitler that modifications would be necessary to reduce the displacement to ensure the new ships met the legal requirements of the [[London Naval Treaty]]. Japan refused to sign the new treaty, and so on 1 April 1937 an [[escalator clause]] permitting treaty signatories to build ships up to a limit of {{convert|45000|LT|abbr=on}} went into effect. The final design displacement of {{convert|41400|LT|abbr=on}} was well within this limit, so Fuchs's modifications were discarded.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=208}}\n\nDespite the fact that Raeder and other senior naval officers envisioned using ''Bismarck'' and ''Tirpitz'' as commerce raiders against first French and later British shipping in the Atlantic, and in fact used them in that role during [[World War II]], the ships were not designed for that mission. Their steam turbines did not afford the necessary cruising radius for such a role, and many of the decisions made for the ships' armament and armor layout reflect the expectation to fight a traditional naval battle at relatively close range in the North Sea. The disconnect between how ''Bismarck'' and ''Tirpitz'' were designed and how they were ultimately used represents the strategic incoherence that dominated German naval construction in the 1930s.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=204\u2013205}}{{sfn|Mulligan|pp=1042\u20131043}}\n\n=== General characteristics ===\nThe ''Bismarck''-class battleships were {{convert|251|m|ftin|abbr=on}} long [[Length overall|overall]] and {{convert|241.60|m|ftin|abbr=on}} long [[Length at the waterline|at the waterline]]. The ships had a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|36|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and a designed [[Draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|9.30|m|ftin|abbr=on}}; the draft at standard [[Displacement (ship)|displacement]] was {{convert|8.63|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and {{convert|9.90|m|ftin|abbr=on}} at a full load. The ships had a designed displacement of {{convert|45950|MT|LT|lk=on}}; ''Bismarck''{{'}}s standard displacement was {{convert|41700|MT|LT|sp=us|abbr=on}}, and when fully laden, the ship displaced {{convert|50300|MT|LT|sp=us|abbr=on}}. ''Tirpitz'' was heavier, displacing {{convert|42900|MT|LT|abbr=on}} and {{convert|52600|MT|LT|abbr=on|sp=us}}, respectively. The ships had a [[double bottom]] for 83&nbsp;percent of the length of the hull, and twenty-two [[watertight compartment]]s. The ships were 90&nbsp;percent welded construction.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=33}} The stern was weakly constructed; this had significant consequences on ''Bismarck''{{'}}s only combat mission.{{sfn|Preston|p=151}}\n\nThe ships were very stable, primarily because of their wide beam. The ships suffered from only slight pitching and rolling, even in the heavy seas of the North Atlantic. ''Bismarck'' and ''Tirpitz'' were responsive to commands from the helm; they were capable of maneuvering with [[rudder]] deflections as small as 5\u00b0. With the rudder completely over, the ships heeled only 3\u00b0, but lost up to 65% of their speed. The ships handled poorly at low speeds or when traveling astern. As a result, tugs were necessary in confined areas to avoid collisions or grounding. The ships had a standard crew of 103 officers and 1,962 enlisted sailors. The ships carried smaller boats, including three picket boats, four barges, one [[Launch (boat)|launch]], two [[pinnace (ship's boat)|pinnaces]], two [[Cutter (boat)|cutters]], two [[yawl]]s, and two [[Dinghy|dinghies]].{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=35}}\n\n=== Propulsion ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 193-30-5-31A, Schlachtschiff Bismarck.jpg|thumb|''Bismarck'' in drydock, showing the three-shaft arrangement]]\n\nThe ''Bismarck''-class ships both had three sets of geared turbine engines; ''Bismarck'' was equipped with [[Blohm & Voss]] turbines, while ''Tirpitz'' used [[Brown, Boveri & Cie|Brown, Boveri, and Co.]] engines. Each set of turbines drove a 3-bladed [[propeller|screw]] that was {{convert|4.70|m|ftin|abbr=on}} in diameter. The three-shaft arrangement was chosen over a four-shaft system, as was typically used on foreign capital ships, since it would save weight. At a full load, the high and medium-pressure turbines ran at 2,825&nbsp;[[revolutions per minute|rpm]], while the low-pressure turbines ran at 2,390&nbsp;rpm. The ships' turbines were powered by twelve Wagner ultra high-pressure, oil-burning [[water-tube boiler]]s. ''Bismarck'' and ''Tirpitz'' were originally intended to use electric-transmission turbines that would have produced {{convert|46000|shp|abbr=on}} apiece. These engines would have provided for a higher top speed, but at the cost of greater weight. The geared turbines were significantly lighter, and as a result had a slight performance advantage. The geared turbines also had a significantly more robust construction, and so they were adopted instead.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|pp=33\u201335}}{{sfn|Mulligan|p=1026}}\n\nBoth ships were rated for a top speed of {{convert|30|kn}}; ''Bismarck'' just exceeded this speed on [[sea trials]], reaching {{convert|30.01|kn}}, while ''Tirpitz'' made {{convert|30.8|kn}} on trials. This difference was largely the result of a significant increase in horsepower for ''Tirpitz'', which reached {{convert|163023|PS|shp kW|lk=on|abbr=on}}, compared to {{convert|150170|PS|shp|0|disp=number}} for ''Bismarck''. The two ships had different fuel stores; ''Bismarck'' was designed to carry 3,200&nbsp;tons of fuel oil, but could store up to 6,400&nbsp;tons of fuel in a normal configuration; with extra fuel bunkers, the fuel carried could be increased up to 7,400&nbsp;tons. ''Tirpitz'' was designed to carry 3,000&nbsp;tons of fuel, and with additional bunkers, was able to store up to 7,780&nbsp;tons. At 19&nbsp;knots, ''Bismarck'' could steam for {{convert|8525|nmi|km}}, and ''Tirpitz'' had a maximum range of {{convert|8870|nmi|km}} at that speed.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=33}}\n\nRobert Ballard, the discoverer of ''Bismarck'', noted that the adoption of the three-shaft arrangement caused serious problems for ''Bismarck''. The center shaft weakened the keel, especially where it emerged from the hull. In addition to retaining greater hull strength, a four-shaft arrangement would have allowed a greater ability to steer the ship using only propeller revolutions than the three-screw system according to Ballard.{{sfn|Ballard|p=232}} During ''Bismarck''{{'}}s Atlantic operation in May 1941, the ship's rudder was disabled by a torpedo hit, and her course could not be corrected by altering screw revolutions;{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=234\u2013237}} this problem had already been revealed during sea trials, but it could not be corrected.{{sfn|von M\u00fcllenheim-Rechberg|p=39}}\n\nElectric power was provided by a variety of generators, including eight 500&nbsp;kW diesel generators arranged in four pairs, five 690&nbsp;kW turbo-generators, and one 460&nbsp;kW generator, the last of which was connected to a 400&nbsp;k[[Volt-ampere|VA]] [[alternating current|AC]] generator. Another 550&nbsp;kVA diesel generator provided additional AC power. The electrical plant provided a total 7,910&nbsp;kW at 220&nbsp;volts.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=35}}\n\n=== Armament ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 193-05-2-07A, Schlachtschiff Bismarck.jpg|thumb|''Bismarck''{{'}}s forward main battery [[gun turret|turret]]]]\n\n==== Main battery ====\n''Bismarck''{{'}}s and ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s main battery consisted of eight [[38 cm SK C/34 naval gun|{{convert|38|cm|in|abbr=on}} SK C/34]] guns in four twin turrets, ''Anton'' and ''Bruno'' in a superfiring pair forward of the [[superstructure]] and ''Caesar'' and ''Dora'' aft.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|pp=34\u201335}} The turrets allowed elevation to 30\u00b0, which gave the guns a maximum range of {{convert|36520|m|yd|abbr=on}}. The guns fired {{convert|800|kg|lb|abbr=on}} projectiles at a [[muzzle velocity]] of 820&nbsp;meters per second (2,690&nbsp;ft/s).{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=275}} The main battery was supplied with between 940\u2013960 shells total, for approximately 115\u2013120 shells per gun.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=35}} As with other German large-caliber naval rifles, these guns were designed by [[Krupp]] and featured sliding wedge breech blocks, which required brass cartridge cases for the propellant charges. Under optimal conditions, the rate of fire was one shot every 18 seconds, or three per minute.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=274}} The gun turrets were electrically trained and the guns were hydraulically elevated. Gun elevation was controlled remotely. The turrets required each gun to return to 2.5\u00b0 elevation for loading.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=278}} ''Tirpitz'' was eventually provided with time-fuzed shells to combat the repeated Allied bombing attacks.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=279}}\n\nThe ''Bismarck''s' use of four twin turrets (the 4 \u00d7 2 configuration) was a design practice that hearkened back to the First World War. Almost all other post-1921 capital ships had triple or even quadruple turrets, which allowed for additional heavy caliber guns, while reducing the number of turrets. Fewer turrets reduced the length of the battleship's armored citadel (particularly magazine length and the armor needed to protect it) and shortened the vessel itself. Although triple turrets were considered for the ''Bismarck''s, there were concerns that the extra barrel would lower the overall rate of fire in each turret, along with fears that a single well-aimed hit could disable a larger proportion of the ship's firepower. It was also felt that four twin turrets allowed for a better field of fire and a more effective sequence of salvos.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=33}}\n\n==== Secondary battery ====\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 193-06-7-16, Schlachtschiff Bismarck.jpg|thumb|One of ''Bismarck''{{'}}s 15&nbsp;cm gun turrets]]\nThe ships' secondary battery consisted of twelve [[15 cm SK C/28|{{convert|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} SK C/28]] guns mounted in six twin turrets.{{sfn|Sturton|p=44}} The 15&nbsp;cm gun turrets were based on the single-gun turrets used aboard the ''Scharnhorst'' class. They could elevate to 40\u00b0 and depress to \u221210\u00b0; they had a rate of fire of around six shots per minute.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=279}} The 15&nbsp;cm guns fired a {{convert|45.3|kg|lb|abbr=on}} shell at a muzzle velocity of 875&nbsp;m/s (2,871&nbsp;ft/s). At maximum elevation, the guns could hit targets out to {{convert|23000|m|yd|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=275}} As with the main battery guns, ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s 15&nbsp;cm guns were later supplied with time-fused shells.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=279}}\n\nThe decision to mount low-angle 15&nbsp;cm guns has been criticized by naval historians, including [[Antony Preston]], who stated that they \"imposed a severe weight penalty\", while American and British battleships were being armed with dual-purpose guns.{{sfn|Preston|p=152}} Naval historians William Garzke and Robert Dulin note that \"the use of dual-purpose armament would have possibly increased the number of anti-aircraft guns, but might have weakened the defence against destroyer attack, which German naval experts deemed more important.\"{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=297}}\n\n==== Anti-aircraft battery ====\nAs built, ''Bismarck'' and ''Tirpitz'' were equipped with an anti-aircraft battery of sixteen [[10.5 cm FlaK 38|{{convert|10.5|cm|in|sp=us|abbr=on}}]] C/33 65-caliber guns in eight twin mounts, sixteen [[3.7 cm SK C/30|{{convert|3.7|cm|in|sp=us|abbr=on}}]] C/30 guns in eight dual mounts, and twelve [[2 cm FlaK 30|{{convert|2|cm|in|sp=us|abbr=on}}]] C/30 guns in individual mounts.{{sfn|Sturton|p=44}} The 10.5&nbsp;cm guns were the same weapons as used aboard the ''Scharnhorst'' class, and were mounted on the first superstructure deck. After ''Bismarck'' was sunk in 1941, two amidships guns on ''Tirpitz'' were moved forward so as to provide them with better fields of fire. The sixteen guns were guided by four fire-control directors, two just aft of the [[conning tower]], a third positioned aft of the main mast, and the fourth directly behind turret Caesar. ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s directors were covered by protective domes, though ''Bismarck''{{'}}s were not.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=280}}\n\nThe ships' 37&nbsp;mm 83-caliber guns were twin mounted and placed in the superstructure. The mounts were hand-operated and automatically stabilized for roll and pitch.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=282}} These guns were supplied with a total of 32,000&nbsp;rounds of ammunition. ''Bismarck'' and ''Tirpitz'' were initially armed with twelve 20&nbsp;mm guns in single mounts, though these were augmented over time.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=35}} ''Bismarck'' received a pair of quadruple gun mountings, for a total of twenty 20&nbsp;mm guns. Over the course of her career, ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s 20&nbsp;mm battery was increased to 78 guns in single and quadruple mountings.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=282}}\n\n=== Armor ===\nThe ''Bismarck''-class ships had an armored belt that ranged in thickness from {{convert|220|to|320|mm|in|abbr=on}}; the thickest section of armor covered the central portion, where the gun turrets, ammunition magazines, and machinery spaces were located. This portion of the belt was capped on either end by 220&nbsp;mm thick transverse bulkheads. The ships had an upper deck that was {{cvt|50|mm|0}} thick, and an armored deck that was between {{cvt|100|to|120|mm}} thick amidships, and tapered down to {{convert|60|mm|in|abbr=on}} at the bow and {{convert|80|mm|in|abbr=on}} at the stern.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=33}} The deck was mounted low in the hull, however, which reduced the volume of internal space protected by the armored citadel. This contrasted with contemporary British and American designs that featured a single thick armored deck mounted high in the ship.{{sfn|Preston|p=151}}\n\nThe forward conning tower had a {{convert|200|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick roof and {{convert|350|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick sides, while the range finder had an armored roof 100&nbsp;mm thick and 200&nbsp;mm thick sides. The aft conning tower had much lighter armor: the roof was 50&nbsp;mm thick and the sides were {{convert|150|mm|in|abbr=on}}, while the aft range finder had a 50&nbsp;mm thick roof and 100&nbsp;mm sides. The main battery turrets were reasonably well-protected: the turret roofs were {{convert|130|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick, the sides were 220&nbsp;mm thick, and the faces were {{convert|360|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick with {{convert|220|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick shields.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=33}} These armor thicknesses were less than those of contemporary British ({{sclass-|King George V|battleship (1939)|5}}) and French (''Richelieu'') designs. Conversely, the secondary battery was better-protected than most rivals.{{sfn|Breyer, ''Battleships and Battle Cruisers''|p=300}} The 15&nbsp;cm gun turrets had {{convert|35|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick roofs, {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} sides, and 100&nbsp;mm fronts.

The granddaughter of the ship's namesake, [[Otto von Bismarck]], christened the ship. As with other German capital ships, ''Bismarck'' was originally built with a straight bow. Experiences with other ships revealed the necessity of a [[clipper]] bow to prevent them from shipping too much water in heavy seas, so Blohm & Voss accordingly modified ''Bismarck''{{'}}s bow during the [[fitting-out]] process. The ship was commissioned into the fleet on 24 August 1940, with [[Kapit\u00e4n zur See]] [[Ernst Lindemann]] in command. Three weeks later, the ship left Hamburg for trials in the [[Baltic Sea]], before returning in December for final fitting-out work. Further trials and tests were conducted in the Baltic in March and April; ''Bismarck'' was placed on active status the following month.{{sfn|Williamson|pp=21\u201322}}\n\n''Tirpitz''{{'}}s keel was laid at the [[Kriegsmarinewerft Wilhelmshaven|''Kriegsmarinewerft'']] (Kriegsmarine Shipyard) in Wilhelmshaven on 20 October 1936,{{sfn|Sturton|p=44}} under construction number 128. She had been ordered under the contract name ''Ersatz Schleswig-Holstein'' to replace the obsolete battleship {{SMS|Schleswig-Holstein||2}}.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=33}} ''Tirpitz'' was named for Grand Admiral [[Alfred von Tirpitz]], the architect of the [[High Seas Fleet]] before World War I.

The operation initially called for a force composed of ''Bismarck'', ''Tirpitz'', and the two {{sclass-|Scharnhorst|battleship|2}}s. ''Tirpitz'' was not yet ready for service by May 1941, and {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} was being overhauled. The force was reduced to ''Bismarck'', {{ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}}, and the heavy cruiser {{ship|German cruiser|Prinz Eugen||2}}. ''Gneisenau'' was damaged by a British bombing raid on [[Brest, France|Brest]], so it was decided that only ''Bismarck'' and ''Prinz Eugen'' would conduct the operation. Admiral [[G\u00fcnther L\u00fctjens]] was placed in command of the pair of ships.{{sfn|Williamson|p=22}}\n\nEarly on the morning of 19 May, ''Bismarck'' left [[Gotenhafen]], bound for the North Atlantic.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=63}} While on the trip through the [[Danish straits|Danish Belt]], ''Bismarck'' and ''Prinz Eugen'' encountered the Swedish cruiser {{HSwMS|Gotland|1933|6}} in [[Kattegat]]; the sighting was passed through the Swedish Navy to the British naval attach\u00e9 in Stockholm.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=65\u201367}} The British [[Royal Air Force]] conducted aerial reconnaissance of the Norwegian fjord in which ''Bismarck'' and ''Prinz Eugen'' had stopped, to confirm the sighting. While in Norway, Admiral L\u00fctjens failed to replenish the approximately {{convert|1000|LT|abbr=on}} of fuel ''Bismarck'' had spent on the first leg of the voyage.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=71}}\n\nBy 23 May, ''Bismarck'' and ''Prinz Eugen'' had reached the [[Denmark Strait]]. That evening, the British cruisers {{HMS|Suffolk|55|2}} and {{HMS|Norfolk|78|2}} briefly engaged ''Bismarck'' before dropping back to shadow the German ships.{{sfn|Williamson|p=23}} At 06:00 the following morning, observers aboard ''Bismarck'' spotted the masts of the battlecruiser {{HMS|Hood|51|2}} and the new battleship {{HMS|Prince of Wales|53|2}}.{{sfn|Williamson|pp=23\u201324}} The British ships steamed directly towards ''Bismarck'' and ''Prinz Eugen'', before attempting a turn to bring the two forces on a roughly parallel course. During the turn, at least one of ''Bismarck''{{'}}s 38&nbsp;cm shells penetrated one of the aft ammunition magazines aboard ''Hood'', which caused a catastrophic explosion and destroyed the ship.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=147\u2013153}} There were only three survivors from ''Hood''{{'}}s crew of 1,421. The German ships then concentrated their fire on ''Prince of Wales'', which was forced to withdraw. ''Bismarck'' did not emerge unscathed; a direct hit on her bow from ''Prince of Wales'' caused ''Bismarck'' to take in some {{convert|2000|LT|abbr=on}} of water. The ship was also leaking oil, which made it easier for the British to track her.{{sfn|Williamson|p=24}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1984-055-14, Schlachtschiff Bismarck, nach Seegefecht.jpg|thumb|left|''Bismarck'' after the battle with ''Hood'' and ''Prince of Wales'']]\n\nAfter retreating, ''Prince of Wales'' joined ''Norfolk'' and ''Suffolk''; the ships briefly engaged ''Bismarck'' at around 18:00. Neither side scored a hit.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=227}} By this time, 19 warships were involved in the chase.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=229}} This included six battleships and battlecruisers and two aircraft carriers, along with a number of cruisers and destroyers.{{sfn|Williamson|p=33}} After the second engagement with ''Prince of Wales'', L\u00fctjens detached ''Prinz Eugen'' to continue the operation while ''Bismarck'' sailed for port.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=176\u2013177}} Shortly before midnight on 24 May, a group of [[Fairey Swordfish]] torpedo bombers from [[825 Naval Air Squadron]] on {{HMS|Victorious|R38|2}} attacked ''Bismarck''. One torpedo struck the ship amidships, though without doing any serious damage. The shock from the explosion, coupled with ''Bismarck''{{'}}s maneuvering at high speed, damaged the temporary repairs that had stopped the flooding from the earlier battle damage. Her speed was reduced to {{convert|16|kn}} to slow the flooding while repair teams fixed the reopened wounds.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=229\u2013230}}\n\nEarly on 25 May, ''Bismarck'' doubled back past her pursuers in a wide circle. The maneuver successfully shook off the British ships, which turned west in an attempt to find the ship. Despite the maneuver, Admiral L\u00fctjens was unaware that he had evaded the British, and so sent a series of radio transmissions, which were intercepted by the British and used to gain a rough fix on his position.{{sfn|Williamson|p=33}} Due to the damage his ship had sustained, L\u00fctjens decided to head for occupied France rather than continue his mission. On the morning of 26 May, a Coastal Command [[PBY Catalina]] flying boat spotted ''Bismarck'' {{convert|690|nmi|abbr=on}} to the north-west of Brest; she was steaming at a speed that would put her under the protective umbrella of German aircraft and [[U-boat]]s within 24&nbsp;hours. The only British forces close enough to slow her down were the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Ark Royal|91|2}} and her escort, the battlecruiser {{HMS|Renown|1916|2}}.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=233}} At approximately 20:30, a flight of fifteen ''Ark Royal''{{'}}s [[820 Naval Air Squadron]]s Swordfish torpedo bombers launched an attack on ''Bismarck''. Three torpedoes were believed to have struck the ship; the first two torpedoes failed to do serious damage to the ship, but the third hit jammed ''Bismarck''{{'}}s rudders hard to starboard. The damage could not be repaired, and the battleship began turning in a large circle, back towards her pursuers.{{sfn|Williamson|p=33}}\n\nAn hour after the Swordfish attack, L\u00fctjens transmitted the following signal to Naval Group Command West: \"Ship unable to maneuver. We will fight to the last shell. Long live the F\u00fchrer.\"{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=266}} At 08:47 the following morning, the battleship {{HMS|Rodney|29|2}} opened fire, followed directly by {{HMS|King George V|41|2}}.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=288}} ''Bismarck'' replied three minutes later, though at 09:02 a 16-inch shell from ''Rodney'' destroyed the forward turrets.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|pp=289\u2013290}} Half an hour later, ''Bismarck''{{'}}s rear turrets were silenced as well.{{sfn|Bercuson & Herwig|p=291}} At around 10:15, both British battleships had ceased fire, their target a burning wreck. The British were running dangerously low on fuel, but ''Bismarck'' had not yet been sunk. The cruiser {{HMS|Dorsetshire|40|2}} fired several torpedoes into the crippled ship, which then took on a severe list to port. At approximately the same time as ''Dorsetshire''{{'}}s attack, engine room crew detonated scuttling charges in the engine rooms.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=245\u2013246}} There is still significant debate as to the direct cause of ''Bismarck''{{'}}s sinking. Only 110 men were rescued by the British before reports of U-boats forced them from the scene.{{sfn|Williamson|pp=34\u201335}} A further five men were rescued by German vessels.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=246}}\n\n=== ''Tirpitz'' ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J19316, Norwegen, Schlachtschiff, Zerst\u00f6rer.jpg|thumb|''Tirpitz'' and several destroyers off the Norwegian coast]]\n{{main|German battleship Tirpitz}}\n''Tirpitz''{{'}}s first action following her commissioning into the Kriegsmarine on 25 February 1941 was to act as a deterrent to a possible Soviet attempt to break out their [[Baltic Fleet]] following the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]].

The force patrolled off the [[\u00c5land Islands]] for a few days before returning to Kiel.{{sfn|Williamson|p=36}} On 14 January 1942, ''Tirpitz'' left German waters for Norway, arriving on the 17th.{{sfn|Breyer, ''\"Tirpitz\"''|p=25}} The Germans used the ship as a [[fleet in being]] to tie down British naval forces to protect the convoy route to the Soviet Union and to deter an invasion of Norway.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=248}}\n\nOn 6 March, ''Tirpitz'', escorted by three destroyers, launched a raid on the [[Arctic convoys of World War II|British convoys to the Soviet Union]].{{sfn|Williamson|p=36}} The Germans attempted to intercept convoys PQ-12 and QP-8,{{sfn|Breyer, ''\"Tirpitz\"''|p=25}} but the inclement weather prevented them from finding the convoys.{{sfn|Williamson|p=36}} The British located ''Tirpitz'', and the aircraft carrier ''Victorious'' launched a strike of twelve [[Fairey Albacore]] torpedo bombers. The aircraft were repulsed without having scored any hits on the German ships. ''Tirpitz'' and the destroyers were back in port by 12 March.{{sfn|Breyer, ''\"Tirpitz\"''|p=25}} The close call prompted Hitler to mandate that ''Tirpitz'' was not to attack another convoy unless its escorting aircraft carrier had been sunk or disabled.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=253}}\n\nOver the next two months, the RAF launched a series of unsuccessful bombing raids against ''Tirpitz'' while she was moored in the [[Faettenfjord]]. The first, by 34 [[Handley Page Halifax]] bombers, took place on 31 March. Two followed a month later, on 28 and 29 April. The first attack was conducted by 43 Halifax and [[Avro Lancaster]] bombers, the second by 34 Halifax and Lancaster.{{sfn|Breyer, ''\"Tirpitz\"''|p=25}} A combination of heavy German anti-aircraft fire and poor weather caused all three missions to fail.{{sfn|Williamson|p=36}} Over the rest of the year and into late 1942, ''Tirpitz'' underwent a refit in the Faettenfjord, which lacked dockyard facilities of any type. As a result, the work was done incrementally; a large [[Caisson (engineering)|caisson]] was built to allow the rudders to be replaced.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=255}} Naval historians William Garzke and Robert Dulin stated that \"the repairs to this ship were one of the most difficult naval engineering feats of World War II.\"{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=256}}\n\nIn January 1943, ''Tirpitz'' emerged from the lengthy overhaul, after which she was transferred to [[Altafjord]]. Here, she participated in extensive training operations with ''Scharnhorst'' and the heavy cruiser {{ship|German cruiser|L\u00fctzow|1940|2}}, which lasted until the middle of the year.{{sfn|Williamson|p=37}} In early September, ''Tirpitz'', ''Scharnhorst'', and ten destroyers bombarded the island of [[Spitzbergen]], which served as a British refuelling station. The two battleships destroyed their targets and returned safely to Altenfjord; this was the first time ''Tirpitz'' fired her main guns in anger.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=258}} On 22\u201323 September, six [[Operation Source|British midget submarines]] attacked ''Tirpitz'' while at anchor. Two of the submarines successfully planted explosive charges against the battleship's hull, which did serious damage. ''Tirpitz'' had been successfully neutralized.{{sfn|Williamson|p=37}} Over the next six months, a workforce of some 1,000 men effected the needed repairs, which were finished by March 1944.{{sfn|Williamson|pp=37\u201338}}\n\n[[File:Fleet Air Arm attack the battleship Tirpitz.jpg|thumb|left|''Tirpitz'' under attack by Barracuda bombers on 3 April]]\n\nThe British resumed the [[List of Allied attacks on the German battleship Tirpitz|series of air attacks]] almost immediately after repairs were completed. On 3 April, the Royal Navy launched [[Operation Tungsten]], during which 40&nbsp;fighters and 40&nbsp;[[Fairey Barracuda|Barracuda]] bombers from six carriers attacked the ship. They scored 15 direct hits and two near misses, which caused heavy damage, killed 122 men, and wounded 316 more. The Royal Navy attempted to repeat the attack three weeks later on the 24th, but had to call the operation off due to inclement weather. Operation Brawn, another carrier-launched attack, followed on 15 May, but again weather interfered. Another carrier strike was attempted on 28 May, but it too was cancelled due to poor weather conditions. [[Operation Mascot]], which was to be conducted by the carriers ''Victorious'', ''Furious'', and {{HMS|Indefatigable|R10|2}} on 17 July, was frustrated by the heavy smokescreen over the battleship.{{sfn|Breyer, ''\"Tirpitz\"''|p=26}}\n\nThe Royal Navy launched the [[Operation Goodwood (naval)|Operation Goodwood]] series in late August. Goodwood I took place on 22 August, with 38 bombers and 43 fighters from five carriers. The attackers failed to score any hits. Goodwood III followed two days later, with 48 bombers and 29 fighters from {{HMS|Formidable|67|2}}, ''Furious'', and ''Indefatigable''. The bombers made two hits on the ship, which did only minor damage. The last Royal Navy operation, Goodwood IV, followed on 29 August. Thirty-four bombers and 25 fighters, launched from ''Formidable'' and ''Indefatigable'', attacked the ship, though fog prevented them from scoring any hits.{{sfn|Breyer, ''\"Tirpitz\"''|p=26}}\n\nThe task of sinking ''Tirpitz'' now fell to the RAF, which performed three airstrikes armed with new {{convert|5400|kg|lb|abbr=on}} [[Tallboy bomb]]s.{{sfn|Breyer, ''\"Tirpitz\"''|p=26}} The first attack, [[Operation Paravane]], came on 15 September, when a force of 27 Lancasters dropped a single Tallboy each; the bombers succeeded in hitting ''Tirpitz'' directly in the bow with one of the bombs. The bomb completely penetrated the ship and exploded directly under her keel. This caused {{convert|1500|MT|abbr=on}} of water to flood the ship; ''Tirpitz'' had again been disabled.{{sfn|Williamson|p=39}} A month later, on 15 October, ''Tirpitz'' was moved to H\u00e5k\u00f8ya Island off [[Troms\u00f8]] to be used as a floating artillery battery. Two weeks later, on 29 October, the British launched [[Operation Obviate]], which consisted of 32 Lancaster bombers. Only a near miss was achieved, though it caused ''Tirpitz'' to take in more water.

As a side effect, once a final answer has been given, it cannot be changed. Many parodies of the game show capitalised on this phrase. However, not every version has taken over such a catchphrase so that the answer is stated rather informally in that case.\n\nPlayers can prevent the host from asking this question, by stating themselves \"final answer\" or some variant after they declare their choice.\n\nAnother hallmark of the show is using dramatic pauses before the host acknowledges whether or not the answer was correct. Occasionally, on some versions, if it is time to go for a commercial break, the host will take the final answer but not announce if it is correct until after the break.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable

As a side effect, once a final answer has been given, it cannot be changed. Many parodies of the game show capitalised on this phrase. However, not every version has taken over such a catchphrase so that the answer is stated rather informally in that case.\n\nPlayers can prevent the host from asking this question, by stating themselves \"final answer\" or some variant after they declare their choice.\n\nAnother hallmark of the show is using dramatic pauses before the host acknowledges whether or not the answer was correct. Occasionally, on some versions, if it is time to go for a commercial break, the host will take the final answer but not announce if it is correct until after the break.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable

An important leader of the [[Texas Revolution]], Houston served as the first and third [[President of the Republic of Texas|president]] of the [[Republic of Texas]], and was one of the first two individuals to represent [[Texas]] in the United States Senate. He also served as the sixth [[governor of Tennessee]] and the seventh [[governor of Texas]], the only American to be elected governor of two different states in the United States.\n\nBorn in [[Rockbridge County, Virginia]], Houston and his family migrated to [[Maryville, Tennessee]] when Houston was a teenager. Houston later ran away from home and spent time with the [[Cherokee]], becoming known as Raven. He served under General [[Andrew Jackson]] in the [[War of 1812]], and after the war, he presided over the [[Indian removal|removal of many Cherokee from Tennessee]]. With the support of Jackson and others, Houston won election to the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 1823. He strongly supported Jackson's presidential candidacies, and in 1827, Houston was elected as the [[governor of Tennessee]]. In 1829, after divorcing his first wife, Houston resigned from office, and joined his Cherokee friends in [[Arkansas Territory]].\n\nHouston settled in [[Texas]] in 1832. After the [[Battle of Gonzales]], Houston helped organize Texas's provisional government and was selected as the top-ranking official in the [[Texian Army]]. He led the Texian Army to victory at the [[Battle of San Jacinto]], the decisive battle in Texas's war for independence against Mexico. After the war, Houston won election in the [[1836 Republic of Texas presidential election|1836 Texas presidential election]]. He left office due to term limits in 1838, but won election to another term in the [[1841 Republic of Texas presidential election|1841 Texas presidential election]]. Houston played a key role in the [[Texas annexation|annexation of Texas]] by the United States in 1845, and in 1846, he was elected to represent Texas in the [[United States Senate]]. He joined the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and supported President [[James K. Polk]]'s prosecution of the [[Mexican\u2013American War]].\n\nHouston's senate record was marked by his unionism and opposition to extremists from both the North and South. He voted for the [[Compromise of 1850]], which settled many of the territorial issues left over from the Mexican\u2013American War and the annexation of Texas. He later voted against the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]] because he believed it would lead to increased sectional tensions over slavery, and his opposition to that act led him to leave the Democratic Party. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the presidential nomination of the [[Know Nothing|American Party]] in the [[1856 United States presidential election|1856 presidential election]] and the [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Union Party]] in the [[1860 United States presidential election|1860 presidential election]]. In 1859, Houston won election as the [[governor of Texas]]. In this role, he opposed secession and unsuccessfully sought to keep Texas out of the [[Confederate States of America]]. He was forced out of office in 1861 and died in 1863. Houston's name has been honored in numerous ways, and he is the eponym of the city of [[Houston]], the fourth most populous city in the United States.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Houstonbirthplacemarker.jpg|thumbnail|left|Sam Houston Birthplace Marker in Rockbridge County, Virginia]]\n\nHouston was         born in Rockbridge County, Virginia on March 2, 1793 to Samuel Houston and Elizabeth Paxton. Both of Houston's parents were descended from Scottish and Irish immigrants who had settled in [[British North America]] in the 1730s.<ref name=\"williams1318\" /> Houston's father was descended from [[Ulster Scots people]]; he could trace his ancestry to [[Sir Hugh de Paduinan]], a [[Normans|Norman]] knight.<ref>Haley (2002), p. 5</ref> By 1793, the elder Samuel Houston owned a large farm and [[slavery in the United States|slaves]] and served as a colonel in the Virginia militia.\n\nHouston's uncle, the Presbyterian Rev. Samuel Houston, was an elected member of the \"lost\" [[State of Franklin]] then in the western frontier of [[North Carolina]], who advocated for the passage of his proposed \"A Declaration of Rights or Form of Government on the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Frankland\" at the convention that was assembled in Greeneville, Tennessee on November 14, 1785. Rev. Houston returned to Rockbridge County, Virginia after the assembled State of Franklin convention rejected his constitutional proposal.<ref>\"Dr. J.G.M. Ramsey Autobiography and Letters,\" p. 317. Edited by Willaim B. Hesseltine. The University of Tennessee Press.</ref>\n\nHouston had five brothers and three sisters as well as dozens of cousins who lived in the surrounding area. According to biographer John Hoyt Williams, Houston was not close with his siblings or his parents, and he rarely spoke of them in his later life.<ref name=\"williams1318\">Williams (1994), pp. 13\u201318</ref> Houston did take an interest in his father's library, reading works by [[Classical antiquity|classical]] authors like [[Virgil]] as well as more recent works by authors such as [[Jedidiah Morse]].<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 10\u201311</ref>\n\nHouston's father was not a good manager and got into debt, in part because of his militia service.<ref>Haley (2002), p. 6</ref> He planned to sell the farm and move west to Tennessee, where land was less expensive, but he died in 1806. Houston's mother followed through on those plans and settled the family near Maryville, Tennessee, the seat of [[Blount County, Tennessee]]. At this time, Tennessee was on the [[American frontier]], and even larger towns like Nashville, Tennessee were vigilant against Native American raids. Houston disliked farming and working in the family store, and at the age of 16, he left his family to live with a [[Cherokee]] tribe led by [[Ahuludegi]] (also spelled Oolooteka).<ref>Williams (1994), pp. 21\u201324</ref> Houston formed a close relationship with Ahuludegi and learned the Cherokee language, becoming known as Raven.<ref>Williams (1994), pp. 25\u201326</ref> He returned to Maryville in 1812, and he was hired at age 19 for a term as the schoolmaster of a one-room schoolhouse.<ref>Haley (2002), p. 10</ref>\n\n==War of 1812 and aftermath==\nIn 1812, Houston enlisted in the United States Army, which then was engaged in the [[War of 1812]] against [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] and Britain's Native American allies. He quickly impressed the commander of the [[39th Infantry Regiment (War of 1812)|39th Infantry Regiment]], [[Thomas Hart Benton (politician)|Thomas Hart Benton]], and by the end of 1813, Houston had risen to the rank of the third lieutenant. In early 1814, the 39th Infantry Regiment became a part of the force commanded General [[Andrew Jackson]], who was charged with putting an end to raids by a faction of the [[Muscogee]] (or \"Creek\") tribe in the [[Old Southwest]].<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 11\u201314</ref> Houston was wounded badly in the [[Battle of Horseshoe Bend (1814)|Battle of Horseshoe Bend]], the decisive battle in the [[Creek War]]. Although army doctors expected him to die of his wounds, Houston survived and convalesced in Maryville and other locations. While many other officers lost their positions after the end of the War of 1812 due to military cutbacks, Houston retained his commission with the help of Congressman [[John Rhea]].<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 15\u201317</ref>\n\nIn early 1817, Houston was assigned to a clerical position in Nashville, serving under the adjutant general for the army's Southern Division. Later in the year, Jackson appointed Houston as a sub-agent to handle the [[Indian removal|removal]] of Cherokee from East Tennessee.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 19\u201320</ref> In February 1818, he received a strong reprimand from Secretary of War [[John C. Calhoun]] after he wore Native American dress to a meeting between Calhoun and Cherokee leaders, beginning an enmity that lasted until Calhoun's death in 1850.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 24\u201325</ref> Angry over the incident with Calhoun and an investigation into his activities, Houston resigned from the army in 1818. He continued to act as a government liaison with the Cherokee, and in 1818, he helped some of the Cherokee resettle in [[Arkansas Territory]].<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 26\u201329</ref>\n\n==Early political career==\nAfter leaving government service, Houston began an apprenticeship with Judge James Trimble in Nashville. He quickly won admission to the state bar and opened a legal practice in Lebanon, Tennessee. With the aid of Governor [[Joseph McMinn]], Houston won election as the solicitor general for Nashville in 1819. He was also appointed as the adjutant general of the Tennessee militia.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 31\u201333</ref> Like his mentors, Houston was a member of the [[Democratic-Republican Party]], which dominated state and national politics in the decade following the War of 1812.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Tennessee gained three seats in the United States House of Representatives after the [[1820 United States Census]], and, with the support of Jackson and McMinn, Houston ran unopposed in the 1823 election for Tennessee's 9th congressional district.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 34\u201335</ref> In his first major speech in Congress, Houston advocated for the recognition of Greece, which was fighting a [[Greek War of Independence|war of independence]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]].<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 38\u201339</ref>\n\nHouston strongly supported Jackson's candidacy in the [[1824 United States presidential election|1824 presidential election]], which saw four major candidates, all from the Democratic-Republican Party, run for president. As no candidate won a majority of the vote, the House of Representatives held a [[contingent election]], which was won by [[John Quincy Adams]].<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 40\u201341</ref> Supporters of Jackson eventually coalesced into the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], and those who favored Adams became known as [[National Republican Party|National Republicans]]. With Jackson's backing, Houston won election as governor of Tennessee in 1827.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 45\u201346</ref> Governor Houston advocated the construction of internal improvements such as canals, and sought to lower the price of land for homesteaders living on public domain. He also aided Jackson's successful campaign in the [[1828 United States presidential election|1828 presidential election]].<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 47\u201349</ref>\n\nIn January 1829, Houston married Eliza Allen, the daughter of wealthy plantation owner John Allen of Gallatin, Tennessee. The marriage quickly fell apart possibly because Eliza loved another man.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 49\u201357</ref> In April 1829, following the collapse of his marriage, Houston resigned as governor of Tennessee. Shortly after leaving office, he traveled to Arkansas Territory to rejoin the Cherokee.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 60\u201361</ref>\n\n==Political exile and controversy==\nHouston was reunited with Ahuludegi's group of Cherokee in mid-1829.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 64\u201365</ref> Because of Houston's experience in government and his connections with President Jackson, several local Native American tribes asked Houston to mediate disputes and communicate their needs to the Jackson administration.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 68\u201369</ref> In late 1829, the Cherokee accorded Houston tribal membership and dispatched him to Washington to negotiate several issues.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 71\u201372</ref> In anticipation of the removal of the remaining Cherokee east of the Mississippi River, Houston made an unsuccessful bid to supply rations to the Native Americans during their journey.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 73\u201374</ref> When Houston returned to Washington in 1832, Congressman [[William Stanbery]] alleged that Houston had placed a fraudulent bid in 1830 in collusion with the Jackson administration. After Stanbery refused to answer Houston's letters regarding the incident, Houston beat Stanbery with a cane.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 80\u201382</ref> After the beating, the House of Representatives brought Houston to trial. By a vote of 106 to 89, the House convicted Houston, and Speaker of the House [[Andrew Stevenson]] formally reprimanded Houston. A federal court also required Houston to pay $500 in damages. \n\nHouston was a slaveholder.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 82\u201386</ref>\n\n==Texas Revolution==\n[[File:General Sam Houston, the hero of San Jacinto.jpg|thumb|General Sam Houston (postcard, circa 1905)]]\n\nIn mid-1832, Houston's friends, [[William H. Wharton]] and [[John Austin Wharton (1806\u201338)|John Austin Wharton]], wrote to convince him to travel to the Mexican possession of [[Mexican Texas|Texas]], where unrest among the American settlers was growing.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 87\u201388</ref> The Mexican government had invited Americans to settle the sparsely populated region of Texas, but many of the settlers, including the Whartons, disliked Mexican rule. Houston crossed into Texas in December 1832, and shortly thereafter, he was granted land in Texas.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 91\u201392</ref> Houston was elected to represent Nacogdoches, Texas at the [[Convention of 1833]], which was called to petition Mexico for statehood (at the time, Texas was part of the state of [[Coahuila y Tejas]]). Houston strongly supported statehood, and he chaired a committee that drew a proposed state constitution.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 96\u201397</ref> After the convention, Texan leader [[Stephen F. Austin]] petitioned the Mexican government for statehood, but he was unable to come to an agreement with President [[Valent\u00edn G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas]]. In 1834, [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]] assumed the presidency, took on new powers, and arrested Austin.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 99\u2013100</ref> In October 1835, the [[Texas Revolution]] broke out with the [[Battle of Gonzales]], a skirmish between Texan forces and the Mexican Army. Shortly after the battle, Houston was elected to the [[Consultation (Texas)|Consultation]], a congregation of Texas leaders.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 109\u2013113</ref>\n\nAlong with Austin and others, Houston helped organize the Consultation into a provisional government for Texas. In November, Houston joined with most other delegates in voting for a measure that demanded Texas statehood and the restoration of the [[1824 Constitution of Mexico]]. The Consultation appointed Houston as a major general and the highest-ranking officer of the [[Texian Army]], though the appointment did not give him effective control of the militia units that constituted the Texian Army.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 113\u2013118</ref> Houston helped organize the [[Convention of 1836]], where the [[Republic of Texas]] [[Texas Declaration of Independence|declared independence]] from Mexico. Shortly after the declaration, the convention received a plea for assistance from [[William B. Travis]], who commanded Texan forces [[Siege of the Alamo|under siege]] by Santa Anna at [[Alamo Mission in San Antonio|the Alamo]]. The convention confirmed Houston's command of the Texian Army and dispatched him to lead a relief of Travis's force, but the Alamo fell before Houston could organize his forces at Gonzales, Texas. Seeking to intimidate Texan forces into surrender, the Mexican army killed every defender at the Alamo; news of the defeat outraged many Texans and caused desertions in Houston's ranks.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 121\u2013124</ref> Commanding a force of about 350 men that numerically was inferior to that of Santa Anna, Houston retreated east across the Colorado River.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 125\u2013128</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header    =\n| header_align = left/right/center\n| header_background =\n| footer    =\n| footer_align = left/right/center\n| footer_background =\n| width     =\n| image1    = Sam Houston at San Jacinto.jpg\n| width1    = 200 \n| alt1      =\n| caption1  = Detail from ''Houston at the [[Battle of San Jacinto]]'' by Henry Arthur McArdle\n| image2    = SantaAnnaSurrender.jpg\n| width2    = 285\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  = ''Surrender of Santa Anna'' by [[William Henry Huddle]] shows the Mexican general [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna|Santa Anna]] surrendering to a wounded Sam Houston.

On the April 21, Houston ordered an attack on the Mexican army, beginning the [[Battle of San Jacinto]].

Burnet]] resigned.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 163\u2013165</ref> During the presidential election, the voters of Texas overwhelmingly indicated their desire for Texas to be annexed by the United States. Houston, meanwhile, faced the challenge of assembling a new government, putting the country's finances in order, and handling relations with Mexico. He selected [[Thomas Jefferson Rusk]] as secretary of war, Smith as secretary of the treasury, [[Samuel Rhoads Fisher]] as secretary of the navy, [[James Collinsworth]] as attorney general, and Austin as secretary of state.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 166\u2013169</ref>{{efn|After Austin died of an illness in December 1836, Houston ordered a month of mourning.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 175\u2013176</ref>}} Houston sought normalized relations with Mexico, and despite some resistance from the legislature, arranged the release of Santa Anna.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 171\u2013172</ref> Concerned about upsetting the balance between [[slave states and free states]], U.S. President Andrew Jackson refused to push for the annexation of Texas, but in his last official act in office he granted Texas diplomatic recognition.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 175, 190</ref> With the United States unwilling to annex Texas, Houston began courting British support; as part of this effort, he urged the end of the importation of slaves into Texas.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 189\u2013190</ref>\n\n[[File:SHouston 2.jpg|thumb|Sam Houston]]\n\nIn early 1837, the government moved to a new capital, the city of Houston, named for the country's first president.<ref>Haley (2002), p. 186</ref> In 1838, Houston frequently clashed with Congress over issues such as a treaty with the Cherokee and a land-office act.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 201\u2013202</ref> The Texas constitution barred presidents from seeking a second term, so Houston did not stand for re-election in the [[1838 Republic of Texas presidential election|1838 election]] and left office in late 1838.

In the [[Oregon Treaty]], reached later in 1846, Britain and the United States agreed to split Oregon Country.<ref>Haley (2002), p. 297</ref> Meanwhile, Polk ordered General [[Zachary Taylor]] to lead a U.S. army to the [[Rio Grande]], which had been set as the Texas-Mexico border under the Treaty of Velasco; Mexico claimed the Nueces River constituted the true border. After a skirmish between Taylor's unit and the Mexican army, the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] broke out in April 1846. Houston initially supported Polk's prosecution of the war, but differences between the two men emerged in 1847.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 297\u2013298</ref> After two years of fighting, the United States defeated Mexico and, through the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], acquired the [[Mexican Cession]]. Mexico also agreed to recognize the Rio Grande as the border between Mexico and Texas.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nAfter the war, disputes over the extension of slavery into the [[United States territory|territories]] raised sectional tensions. Unlike most of his Southern colleagues, Houston voted for the [[Oregon Bill of 1848]], which organized [[Oregon Territory]] as a free territory. Defending his vote to create a territory that excluded slavery, Houston stated \"I would be the last man to wish to do anything injurious to the South, but I do not think that on all occasions we are justified in agitating [slavery].\"<ref>Haley (2002), p. 301</ref> He criticized both Northern [[abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] and Democratic followers of Calhoun as extremists who sought to undermine the union.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 302\u2013304</ref> He supported the [[Compromise of 1850]], a sectional compromise on slavery on the territories. Under the compromise, California was admitted as a free state, the slave trade was prohibited in the District of Columbia, a more stringent [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850|fugitive slave law]] was passed, and [[Utah Territory]] and [[New Mexico Territory]] were established. Texas gave up some of its claims on New Mexico, but it retained El Paso, Texas, and the United States assumed Texas's large public debt.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 304\u2013308</ref> Houston sought the Democratic nomination in the [[1852 United States presidential election|1852 presidential election]], but he was unable to consolidate support outside of his home state. The [[1852 Democratic National Convention]] ultimately nominated [[Franklin Pierce]], a compromise nominee, who went on to win the election.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 311\u2013313</ref>\n\n===Pierce and Buchanan administrations (1853\u20131859)===\n{{see also|Presidency of Franklin Pierce|Presidency of James Buchanan}}\n[[File:Sam Houston c1856-59-crop.png|thumb|Houston in 1859]]\n\nIn 1854, Senator [[Stephen A. Douglas]] led the passage of the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]], which organized [[Kansas Territory]] and [[Nebraska Territory]]. The act also repealed the [[Missouri Compromise]], an act that had banned slavery in territories north of parallel 36\u00b030\u2032 north. Houston voted against the act, in part because he believed that Native Americans would lose much of their land as a result of the act. He also perceived that it would lead to increased sectional tensions over slavery.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 321\u2013326</ref> Houston's opposition to the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act led to his departure from the Democratic Party.<ref>Cantrell (1993), p. 333</ref> In 1855, Houston began to be associated publicly with the American Party, the political wing of the [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] and unionist [[Know Nothing]] movement.<ref>Cantrell (1993), pp. 328\u2013330</ref> The Whig Party had collapsed after the passage of the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act, and the Know Nothings and the anti-slavery [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] had both emerged as major political movements.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 340\u2013341</ref> Houston's affiliation with the party stemmed in part from his fear of the growing influence of Catholic voters; though he opposed barring Catholics from holding office, he wanted to extend the [[naturalization]] period for immigrants to 21 years.<ref>Cantrell (1993), pp. 330\u2013333</ref> He was attracted to the Know Nothing's support for a Native American state as well the party's unionist stance.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 341\u2013342</ref>\n\nHouston sought the presidential nomination at the [[1856 American National Convention|Know Nothing party's 1856 national convention]], but the party nominated former President [[Millard Fillmore]]. Houston was disappointed by Fillmore's selection as well as the party platform, which did not rebuke the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act, but he eventually decided to support Fillmore's candidacy. Despite Houston's renewed support, the American Party split over slavery, and Democrat [[James Buchanan]] won the [[1856 United States presidential election|1856 presidential election]]. The American Party collapsed after the election, and Houston did not affiliate with a national political party for the remainder of his tenure in the senate.<ref>Cantrell (1993), pp. 340\u2013342</ref> In the [[1857 Texas gubernatorial election]], Texas Democrats nominated [[Hardin Richard Runnels]], who supported the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act and attacked Houston's record. In response, Houston announced his own candidacy for governor, but Runnels defeated him by a decisive margin.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 344, 352</ref> After the gubernatorial election, the Texas legislature denied Houston re-election in the senate; Houston rejected calls to resign immediately and served until the end of his term in early 1859.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 353, 360</ref>\n\n==Governor of Texas==\n{{see also|Texas in the American Civil War}}\n[[File:Sam Houston by Mathew Brady.jpg|thumb|Sam Houston in 1861.]]\n\nHouston ran against Runnels in the [[1859 Texas gubernatorial election|1859 gubernatorial election]]. Capitalizing on Runnels's unpopularity over state issues such as Native American raids, Houston won the election and took office in December 1859.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 362\u2013365</ref> In the [[1860 United States presidential election|1860 presidential election]], Houston and [[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|John Bell]] were the two major contenders for the presidential nomination of the newly-formed [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Union Party]], which consisted largely of Southern unionists. Houston narrowly trailed Bell on the first ballot of the [[1860 Constitutional Union Convention]], but Bell clinched the nomination on the second ballot.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 371\u2013372</ref> Nonetheless, some of Houston's Texan supporters nominated him for president in April 1860. Other backers attempted to launch a nationwide campaign, but in August 1860, Houston announced that he would not be a candidate for president. He refused to endorse any of the remaining presidential candidates.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 372\u2013374</ref> In late 1860, Houston campaigned across his home state, calling on Texans to resist those who advocated for secession if Republican nominee [[Abraham Lincoln]] won the 1860 election.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 380\u2013382</ref>\n\nAfter Lincoln won the November 1860 presidential election, several Southern states seceded from the United States and formed the [[Confederate States of America]].<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 383\u2013384</ref> A Texas political convention voted to secede from the United States on February 1, 1861, and Houston proclaimed that Texas was once again an independent republic, but he refused to recognize that same convention's authority to join Texas to the Confederacy. After Houston refused to swear an oath of loyalty to the Confederacy, the legislature declared the governorship vacant. Houston did not recognize the validity of his removal, but he did not attempt to use force to remain in office, and he refused aid from the federal government to prevent his removal. His successor, [[Edward Clark (governor)|Edward Clark]], was sworn in on March 18.<ref>Westwood (1984), pp. 128\u2013129, 133\u2013134</ref> In an undelivered speech, Houston wrote:\n\n{{quote|Fellow-Citizens, in the name of your rights and liberties, which I believe have been trampled upon, I refuse to take this oath.  In the name of the nationality of Texas, which has been betrayed by the Convention, I refuse to take this oath.  In the name of the Constitution of Texas, I refuse to take this oath.  In the name of my own conscience and manhood, which this Convention would degrade by dragging me before it, to pander to the malice of my enemies, I refuse to take this oath.  I deny the power of this Convention to speak for Texas. ... I protest. ... against all the acts and doings of this convention and I declare them null and void.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 390\u2013391.</ref>}}\n\nOn April 19, 1861, he told a crowd:\n\n{{quote|Let me tell you what is coming.  After the sacrifice of countless millions of treasure and hundreds of thousands of lives, you may win Southern independence if God be not against you, but I doubt it.  I tell you that, while I believe with you in the doctrine of states rights, the North is determined to preserve this Union. They are not a fiery, impulsive people as you are, for they live in colder climates. But when they begin to move in a given direction, they move with the steady momentum and perseverance of a mighty avalanche; and what I fear is, they will overwhelm the South.<ref>Haley (2002), p. 397</ref>}}\n\n==Retirement and death==\n[[File:Sam Houston Grave.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.1|Houston's grave in Huntsville, Texas]]\n\nAfter leaving office, Houston returned to his home in Galveston.<ref>Westwood (1984), p. 129</ref> He later settled in Huntsville, Texas, where he lived in a structure known as the [[Steamboat House (Huntsville, Texas)|Steamboat House]]. In the midst of the Civil War, Houston was shunned by many Texas leaders, though he continued to correspond with Confederate officer [[Ashbel Smith]] and Texas governor [[Francis Lubbock]]. His son, Sam Houston, Jr., served in the Confederate army during the Civil War, but returned home after being wounded at the [[Battle of Shiloh]].<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 399\u2013405</ref> Houston's health suffered a precipitous decline in April 1863, and he died on July 26, 1863, at 70 years of age .<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 412\u2013415</ref>\n\nThe inscription on Houston's tomb reads:\n<poem>\nA Brave Soldier. A Fearless Statesman.\nA Great Orator\u2014A Pure Patriot.\nA Faithful Friend, A Loyal Citizen.\nA Devoted Husband and Father.\nA Consistent Christian\u2014An Honest Man.\n</poem>\n\n== Personal life ==\n[[File:Margaret Lea Houston 1839.jpg|right|thumb|[[Margaret Lea Houston]]]]\n\nIn January 1829 Sam Houston, then Governor of Tennessee, married 19-year-old Eliza Allen. The marriage lasted 11 weeks. Neither Houston nor Eliza ever gave a reason for their separation, but Eliza refused to sanction divorce. Subsequently, he resigned his governorship and went to live with his Cherokee family. In the summer of 1830, Houston married Tiana Rogers (sometimes called Diana), daughter of Chief John \"Hellfire\" Rogers (1740\u20131833), a Scots-Irish trader, and Jennie Due (1764\u20131806), a sister of Chief John Jolly, in a Cherokee ceremony. The ceremony was modest since it was Tiana's second marriage; she was widowed with two children from her previous marriage: Gabriel, born 1819, and Joanna, born 1822. She and Houston first met when she was ten years old, and he was stunned to see how beautiful she was when he returned to her village years later. The two lived together for several years. Tennessee society disapproved of the marriage because under civil law, he was still legally married to Eliza Allen Houston. After declining to accompany Houston to Texas in 1832, Tiana later remarried. She died in 1838 of pneumonia.<ref>Haley (2002), p. 70</ref> [[Will Rogers]] was her nephew, three generations removed.<ref>Marquis (1930), pp. 150-152.</ref>\n\nIn 1837, after becoming President of the Republic of Texas, he was able to acquire, from a district court judge, a divorce from Eliza Allen.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sam Houston and Eliza Allen: \u201cTen Thousand Imputed Slanders\u201d |url=https://www.tennesseehistory.org/sam-houston-eliza-allen-ten-thousand-imputed-slanders/ |publisher=The Tennessee Historical Society |accessdate=13 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1839, he purchased a horse which became one of the foundation sires of the [[American Quarter Horse]] breed named [[Copperbottom]]. He owned the horse until its death in 1860.<ref name=\"History\">[https://www.aqha.com/history-of-the-quarter-horse History of the American Quarter Horse]</ref><ref name=\"Lost\">[http://horsesonly.com/pednotes/WL/copperb.htm Copperbottom: A Lost Bloodline]</ref><ref name=\"Copperbottom\">[http://quarterhorserecord.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Copperbottom.pdf Copperbottom]</ref>\n\nOn May 9, 1840, Houston, aged 47, married for a third time. His bride was 21-year-old [[Margaret Lea Houston|Margaret Moffette Lea]] of Marion, Alabama, the daughter of planters. They had eight children. Margaret acted as a tempering influence on her much older husband and convinced him to stop drinking. Although the Houstons had numerous houses, they kept only one continuously: Cedar Point (1840\u20131863) on [[Trinity Bay (Texas)|Trinity Bay]].{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nIn 1833, Houston was baptized into the Catholic faith in order to qualify under the existing Mexican law for property ownership in [[Coahuila y Tejas]]. The sacrament was held in the living room of the [[Adolphus Sterne House]] in Nacogdoches, Texas.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 104\u2013105</ref> By 1854, Margaret had spent 14 years trying to convert Houston to the Baptist church. With the assistance of [[George Washington Baines]], she convinced Houston to convert, and he agreed to adult baptism. Spectators from neighboring communities came to Independence, Texas to witness the event. On November 19, 1854, Houston was baptized by Rev. [[Rufus Columbus Burleson|Rufus C. Burleson]] by immersion in Little Rocky Creek, two miles southeast of Independence.<ref>{{cite web|last=Augustin|first=Byron|title=Independence, Texas|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hli03|work=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=March 9, 2012|author2=Pitts, William L}}</ref><ref>Seale (1992) pp. 167\u2013171</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Statue of Sam Houston -- Huntsville, Texas.jpg|200px|right|thumb|''[[A Tribute to Courage]]'']]\nHouston, the largest city in Texas and the [[Southern United States|American South]], is named for Sam Houston.

An important leader of the [[Texas Revolution]], Houston served as the first and third [[President of the Republic of Texas|president]] of the [[Republic of Texas]], and was one of the first two individuals to represent [[Texas]] in the United States Senate. He also served as the sixth [[governor of Tennessee]] and the seventh [[governor of Texas]], the only American to be elected governor of two different states in the United States.\n\nBorn in [[Rockbridge County, Virginia]], Houston and his family migrated to [[Maryville, Tennessee]] when Houston was a teenager. Houston later ran away from home and spent time with the [[Cherokee]], becoming known as Raven. He served under General [[Andrew Jackson]] in the [[War of 1812]], and after the war, he presided over the [[Indian removal|removal of many Cherokee from Tennessee]]. With the support of Jackson and others, Houston won election to the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 1823. He strongly supported Jackson's presidential candidacies, and in 1827, Houston was elected as the [[governor of Tennessee]]. In 1829, after divorcing his first wife, Houston resigned from office, and joined his Cherokee friends in [[Arkansas Territory]].\n\nHouston settled in [[Texas]] in 1832. After the [[Battle of Gonzales]], Houston helped organize Texas's provisional government and was selected as the top-ranking official in the [[Texian Army]]. He led the Texian Army to victory at the [[Battle of San Jacinto]], the decisive battle in Texas's war for independence against Mexico. After the war, Houston won election in the [[1836 Republic of Texas presidential election|1836 Texas presidential election]]. He left office due to term limits in 1838, but won election to another term in the [[1841 Republic of Texas presidential election|1841 Texas presidential election]]. Houston played a key role in the [[Texas annexation|annexation of Texas]] by the United States in 1845, and in 1846, he was elected to represent Texas in the [[United States Senate]]. He joined the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and supported President [[James K. Polk]]'s prosecution of the [[Mexican\u2013American War]].\n\nHouston's senate record was marked by his unionism and opposition to extremists from both the North and South. He voted for the [[Compromise of 1850]], which settled many of the territorial issues left over from the Mexican\u2013American War and the annexation of Texas. He later voted against the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]] because he believed it would lead to increased sectional tensions over slavery, and his opposition to that act led him to leave the Democratic Party. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the presidential nomination of the [[Know Nothing|American Party]] in the [[1856 United States presidential election|1856 presidential election]] and the [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Union Party]] in the [[1860 United States presidential election|1860 presidential election]]. In 1859, Houston won election as the [[governor of Texas]]. In this role, he opposed secession and unsuccessfully sought to keep Texas out of the [[Confederate States of America]]. He was forced out of office in 1861 and died in 1863. Houston's name has been honored in numerous ways, and he is the eponym of the city of [[Houston]], the fourth most populous city in the United States.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Houstonbirthplacemarker.jpg|thumbnail|left|Sam Houston Birthplace Marker in Rockbridge County, Virginia]]\n\nHouston was         born in Rockbridge County, Virginia on March 2, 1793 to Samuel Houston and Elizabeth Paxton. Both of Houston's parents were descended from Scottish and Irish immigrants who had settled in [[British North America]] in the 1730s.<ref name=\"williams1318\" /> Houston's father was descended from [[Ulster Scots people]]; he could trace his ancestry to [[Sir Hugh de Paduinan]], a [[Normans|Norman]] knight.<ref>Haley (2002), p. 5</ref> By 1793, the elder Samuel Houston owned a large farm and [[slavery in the United States|slaves]] and served as a colonel in the Virginia militia.\n\nHouston's uncle, the Presbyterian Rev. Samuel Houston, was an elected member of the \"lost\" [[State of Franklin]] then in the western frontier of [[North Carolina]], who advocated for the passage of his proposed \"A Declaration of Rights or Form of Government on the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Frankland\" at the convention that was assembled in Greeneville, Tennessee on November 14, 1785. Rev. Houston returned to Rockbridge County, Virginia after the assembled State of Franklin convention rejected his constitutional proposal.<ref>\"Dr. J.G.M. Ramsey Autobiography and Letters,\" p. 317. Edited by Willaim B. Hesseltine. The University of Tennessee Press.</ref>\n\nHouston had five brothers and three sisters as well as dozens of cousins who lived in the surrounding area. According to biographer John Hoyt Williams, Houston was not close with his siblings or his parents, and he rarely spoke of them in his later life.<ref name=\"williams1318\">Williams (1994), pp. 13\u201318</ref> Houston did take an interest in his father's library, reading works by [[Classical antiquity|classical]] authors like [[Virgil]] as well as more recent works by authors such as [[Jedidiah Morse]].<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 10\u201311</ref>\n\nHouston's father was not a good manager and got into debt, in part because of his militia service.<ref>Haley (2002), p. 6</ref> He planned to sell the farm and move west to Tennessee, where land was less expensive, but he died in 1806. Houston's mother followed through on those plans and settled the family near Maryville, Tennessee, the seat of [[Blount County, Tennessee]]. At this time, Tennessee was on the [[American frontier]], and even larger towns like Nashville, Tennessee were vigilant against Native American raids. Houston disliked farming and working in the family store, and at the age of 16, he left his family to live with a [[Cherokee]] tribe led by [[Ahuludegi]] (also spelled Oolooteka).<ref>Williams (1994), pp. 21\u201324</ref> Houston formed a close relationship with Ahuludegi and learned the Cherokee language, becoming known as Raven.<ref>Williams (1994), pp. 25\u201326</ref> He returned to Maryville in 1812, and he was hired at age 19 for a term as the schoolmaster of a one-room schoolhouse.<ref>Haley (2002), p. 10</ref>\n\n==War of 1812 and aftermath==\nIn 1812, Houston enlisted in the United States Army, which then was engaged in the [[War of 1812]] against [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] and Britain's Native American allies. He quickly impressed the commander of the [[39th Infantry Regiment (War of 1812)|39th Infantry Regiment]], [[Thomas Hart Benton (politician)|Thomas Hart Benton]], and by the end of 1813, Houston had risen to the rank of the third lieutenant. In early 1814, the 39th Infantry Regiment became a part of the force commanded General [[Andrew Jackson]], who was charged with putting an end to raids by a faction of the [[Muscogee]] (or \"Creek\") tribe in the [[Old Southwest]].<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 11\u201314</ref> Houston was wounded badly in the [[Battle of Horseshoe Bend (1814)|Battle of Horseshoe Bend]], the decisive battle in the [[Creek War]]. Although army doctors expected him to die of his wounds, Houston survived and convalesced in Maryville and other locations. While many other officers lost their positions after the end of the War of 1812 due to military cutbacks, Houston retained his commission with the help of Congressman [[John Rhea]].<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 15\u201317</ref>\n\nIn early 1817, Houston was assigned to a clerical position in Nashville, serving under the adjutant general for the army's Southern Division. Later in the year, Jackson appointed Houston as a sub-agent to handle the [[Indian removal|removal]] of Cherokee from East Tennessee.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 19\u201320</ref> In February 1818, he received a strong reprimand from Secretary of War [[John C. Calhoun]] after he wore Native American dress to a meeting between Calhoun and Cherokee leaders, beginning an enmity that lasted until Calhoun's death in 1850.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 24\u201325</ref> Angry over the incident with Calhoun and an investigation into his activities, Houston resigned from the army in 1818. He continued to act as a government liaison with the Cherokee, and in 1818, he helped some of the Cherokee resettle in [[Arkansas Territory]].<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 26\u201329</ref>\n\n==Early political career==\nAfter leaving government service, Houston began an apprenticeship with Judge James Trimble in Nashville. He quickly won admission to the state bar and opened a legal practice in Lebanon, Tennessee. With the aid of Governor [[Joseph McMinn]], Houston won election as the solicitor general for Nashville in 1819. He was also appointed as the adjutant general of the Tennessee militia.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 31\u201333</ref> Like his mentors, Houston was a member of the [[Democratic-Republican Party]], which dominated state and national politics in the decade following the War of 1812.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Tennessee gained three seats in the United States House of Representatives after the [[1820 United States Census]], and, with the support of Jackson and McMinn, Houston ran unopposed in the 1823 election for Tennessee's 9th congressional district.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 34\u201335</ref> In his first major speech in Congress, Houston advocated for the recognition of Greece, which was fighting a [[Greek War of Independence|war of independence]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]].<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 38\u201339</ref>\n\nHouston strongly supported Jackson's candidacy in the [[1824 United States presidential election|1824 presidential election]], which saw four major candidates, all from the Democratic-Republican Party, run for president. As no candidate won a majority of the vote, the House of Representatives held a [[contingent election]], which was won by [[John Quincy Adams]].<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 40\u201341</ref> Supporters of Jackson eventually coalesced into the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], and those who favored Adams became known as [[National Republican Party|National Republicans]]. With Jackson's backing, Houston won election as governor of Tennessee in 1827.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 45\u201346</ref> Governor Houston advocated the construction of internal improvements such as canals, and sought to lower the price of land for homesteaders living on public domain. He also aided Jackson's successful campaign in the [[1828 United States presidential election|1828 presidential election]].<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 47\u201349</ref>\n\nIn January 1829, Houston married Eliza Allen, the daughter of wealthy plantation owner John Allen of Gallatin, Tennessee. The marriage quickly fell apart possibly because Eliza loved another man.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 49\u201357</ref> In April 1829, following the collapse of his marriage, Houston resigned as governor of Tennessee. Shortly after leaving office, he traveled to Arkansas Territory to rejoin the Cherokee.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 60\u201361</ref>\n\n==Political exile and controversy==\nHouston was reunited with Ahuludegi's group of Cherokee in mid-1829.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 64\u201365</ref> Because of Houston's experience in government and his connections with President Jackson, several local Native American tribes asked Houston to mediate disputes and communicate their needs to the Jackson administration.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 68\u201369</ref> In late 1829, the Cherokee accorded Houston tribal membership and dispatched him to Washington to negotiate several issues.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 71\u201372</ref> In anticipation of the removal of the remaining Cherokee east of the Mississippi River, Houston made an unsuccessful bid to supply rations to the Native Americans during their journey.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 73\u201374</ref> When Houston returned to Washington in 1832, Congressman [[William Stanbery]] alleged that Houston had placed a fraudulent bid in 1830 in collusion with the Jackson administration. After Stanbery refused to answer Houston's letters regarding the incident, Houston beat Stanbery with a cane.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 80\u201382</ref> After the beating, the House of Representatives brought Houston to trial. By a vote of 106 to 89, the House convicted Houston, and Speaker of the House [[Andrew Stevenson]] formally reprimanded Houston. A federal court also required Houston to pay $500 in damages. \n\nHouston was a slaveholder.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 82\u201386</ref>\n\n==Texas Revolution==\n[[File:General Sam Houston, the hero of San Jacinto.jpg|thumb|General Sam Houston (postcard, circa 1905)]]\n\nIn mid-1832, Houston's friends, [[William H. Wharton]] and [[John Austin Wharton (1806\u201338)|John Austin Wharton]], wrote to convince him to travel to the Mexican possession of [[Mexican Texas|Texas]], where unrest among the American settlers was growing.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 87\u201388</ref> The Mexican government had invited Americans to settle the sparsely populated region of Texas, but many of the settlers, including the Whartons, disliked Mexican rule. Houston crossed into Texas in December 1832, and shortly thereafter, he was granted land in Texas.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 91\u201392</ref> Houston was elected to represent Nacogdoches, Texas at the [[Convention of 1833]], which was called to petition Mexico for statehood (at the time, Texas was part of the state of [[Coahuila y Tejas]]). Houston strongly supported statehood, and he chaired a committee that drew a proposed state constitution.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 96\u201397</ref> After the convention, Texan leader [[Stephen F. Austin]] petitioned the Mexican government for statehood, but he was unable to come to an agreement with President [[Valent\u00edn G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas]]. In 1834, [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]] assumed the presidency, took on new powers, and arrested Austin.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 99\u2013100</ref> In October 1835, the [[Texas Revolution]] broke out with the [[Battle of Gonzales]], a skirmish between Texan forces and the Mexican Army. Shortly after the battle, Houston was elected to the [[Consultation (Texas)|Consultation]], a congregation of Texas leaders.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 109\u2013113</ref>\n\nAlong with Austin and others, Houston helped organize the Consultation into a provisional government for Texas. In November, Houston joined with most other delegates in voting for a measure that demanded Texas statehood and the restoration of the [[1824 Constitution of Mexico]]. The Consultation appointed Houston as a major general and the highest-ranking officer of the [[Texian Army]], though the appointment did not give him effective control of the militia units that constituted the Texian Army.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 113\u2013118</ref> Houston helped organize the [[Convention of 1836]], where the [[Republic of Texas]] [[Texas Declaration of Independence|declared independence]] from Mexico. Shortly after the declaration, the convention received a plea for assistance from [[William B. Travis]], who commanded Texan forces [[Siege of the Alamo|under siege]] by Santa Anna at [[Alamo Mission in San Antonio|the Alamo]]. The convention confirmed Houston's command of the Texian Army and dispatched him to lead a relief of Travis's force, but the Alamo fell before Houston could organize his forces at Gonzales, Texas. Seeking to intimidate Texan forces into surrender, the Mexican army killed every defender at the Alamo; news of the defeat outraged many Texans and caused desertions in Houston's ranks.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 121\u2013124</ref> Commanding a force of about 350 men that numerically was inferior to that of Santa Anna, Houston retreated east across the Colorado River.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 125\u2013128</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header    =\n| header_align = left/right/center\n| header_background =\n| footer    =\n| footer_align = left/right/center\n| footer_background =\n| width     =\n| image1    = Sam Houston at San Jacinto.jpg\n| width1    = 200 \n| alt1      =\n| caption1  = Detail from ''Houston at the [[Battle of San Jacinto]]'' by Henry Arthur McArdle\n| image2    = SantaAnnaSurrender.jpg\n| width2    = 285\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  = ''Surrender of Santa Anna'' by [[William Henry Huddle]] shows the Mexican general [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna|Santa Anna]] surrendering to a wounded Sam Houston.

On the April 21, Houston ordered an attack on the Mexican army, beginning the [[Battle of San Jacinto]]. The Texans quickly routed Santa Anna's force, though Houston's ankle was shattered by a stray bullet.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 147\u2013151</ref>  In the aftermath of the Battle of San Jacinto, a detachment of Texans captured Santa Anna.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 153\u2013154</ref> Santa Anna was forced to sign the [[Treaty of Velasco]], granting Texas its independence. Houston stayed briefly for negotiations, then returned to the United States for treatment of his ankle wound.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n==President of Texas==\n[[File:Wpdms republic of texas.svg|thumb|upright=1|The Republic of Texas after the [[Texas Revolution]]]]\n\nVictory in the Battle of San Jacinto made Houston a hero to many Texans, and he won the [[1836 Republic of Texas presidential election|1836 Texas presidential election]], defeating Stephen F. Austin and former governor [[Henry Smith (Texas governor)|Henry Smith]]. Houston took office on October 22, 1836 after interim president [[David G. Burnet]] resigned.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 163\u2013165</ref> During the presidential election, the voters of Texas overwhelmingly indicated their desire for Texas to be annexed by the United States. Houston, meanwhile, faced the challenge of assembling a new government, putting the country's finances in order, and handling relations with Mexico.

However, Van Buren's opposition to annexation damaged his candidacy, and he was defeated by [[James K.

Polk defeated Clay in the general election, giving backers of annexation an [[Mandate (politics)|electoral mandate]]. Meanwhile, Houston's term ended in December 1844, and he was succeeded by Anson Jones, his secretary of state. In the waning days of his own presidency, Tyler used Polk's victory to convince Congress to approve of the [[annexation of Texas]]. Seeking Texas's immediate acceptance of annexation, Tyler made Texas a generous offer that allowed the state to retain control of its public lands, though it would be required to keep its public debt.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 285\u2013287</ref> A Texas convention approved of the offer of annexation in July 1845, and Texas became a U.S. state in February 1846.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 293\u2013294</ref>\n\n==U.S. Senator==\n\n===Mexican\u2013American War and aftermath (1846\u20131853)===\n{{see also|Presidency of James K.

In the [[Oregon Treaty]], reached later in 1846, Britain and the United States agreed to split Oregon Country.<ref>Haley (2002), p. 297</ref> Meanwhile, Polk ordered General [[Zachary Taylor]] to lead a U.S. army to the [[Rio Grande]], which had been set as the Texas-Mexico border under the Treaty of Velasco; Mexico claimed the Nueces River constituted the true border. After a skirmish between Taylor's unit and the Mexican army, the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] broke out in April 1846. Houston initially supported Polk's prosecution of the war, but differences between the two men emerged in 1847.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 297\u2013298</ref> After two years of fighting, the United States defeated Mexico and, through the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], acquired the [[Mexican Cession]].

Unlike most of his Southern colleagues, Houston voted for the [[Oregon Bill of 1848]], which organized [[Oregon Territory]] as a free territory. Defending his vote to create a territory that excluded slavery, Houston stated \"I would be the last man to wish to do anything injurious to the South, but I do not think that on all occasions we are justified in agitating [slavery].\"<ref>Haley (2002), p. 301</ref> He criticized both Northern [[abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] and Democratic followers of Calhoun as extremists who sought to undermine the union.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 302\u2013304</ref> He supported the [[Compromise of 1850]], a sectional compromise on slavery on the territories. Under the compromise, California was admitted as a free state, the slave trade was prohibited in the District of Columbia, a more stringent [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850|fugitive slave law]] was passed, and [[Utah Territory]] and [[New Mexico Territory]] were established. Texas gave up some of its claims on New Mexico, but it retained El Paso, Texas, and the United States assumed Texas's large public debt.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 304\u2013308</ref> Houston sought the Democratic nomination in the [[1852 United States presidential election|1852 presidential election]], but he was unable to consolidate support outside of his home state.

Douglas]] led the passage of the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]], which organized [[Kansas Territory]] and [[Nebraska Territory]]. The act also repealed the [[Missouri Compromise]], an act that had banned slavery in territories north of parallel 36\u00b030\u2032 north. Houston voted against the act, in part because he believed that Native Americans would lose much of their land as a result of the act. He also perceived that it would lead to increased sectional tensions over slavery.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 321\u2013326</ref> Houston's opposition to the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act led to his departure from the Democratic Party.<ref>Cantrell (1993), p. 333</ref> In 1855, Houston began to be associated publicly with the American Party, the political wing of the [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] and unionist [[Know Nothing]] movement.<ref>Cantrell (1993), pp. 328\u2013330</ref> The Whig Party had collapsed after the passage of the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act, and the Know Nothings and the anti-slavery [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] had both emerged as major political movements.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 340\u2013341</ref> Houston's affiliation with the party stemmed in part from his fear of the growing influence of Catholic voters; though he opposed barring Catholics from holding office, he wanted to extend the [[naturalization]] period for immigrants to 21 years.<ref>Cantrell (1993), pp. 330\u2013333</ref> He was attracted to the Know Nothing's support for a Native American state as well the party's unionist stance.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 341\u2013342</ref>\n\nHouston sought the presidential nomination at the [[1856 American National Convention|Know Nothing party's 1856 national convention]], but the party nominated former President [[Millard Fillmore]]. Houston was disappointed by Fillmore's selection as well as the party platform, which did not rebuke the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act, but he eventually decided to support Fillmore's candidacy. Despite Houston's renewed support, the American Party split over slavery, and Democrat [[James Buchanan]] won the [[1856 United States presidential election|1856 presidential election]]. The American Party collapsed after the election, and Houston did not affiliate with a national political party for the remainder of his tenure in the senate.<ref>Cantrell (1993), pp. 340\u2013342</ref> In the [[1857 Texas gubernatorial election]], Texas Democrats nominated [[Hardin Richard Runnels]], who supported the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act and attacked Houston's record.

Houston did not recognize the validity of his removal, but he did not attempt to use force to remain in office, and he refused aid from the federal government to prevent his removal.

The marriage lasted 11 weeks. Neither Houston nor Eliza ever gave a reason for their separation, but Eliza refused to sanction divorce. Subsequently, he resigned his governorship and went to live with his Cherokee family. In the summer of 1830, Houston married Tiana Rogers (sometimes called Diana), daughter of Chief John \"Hellfire\" Rogers (1740\u20131833), a Scots-Irish trader, and Jennie Due (1764\u20131806), a sister of Chief John Jolly, in a Cherokee ceremony. The ceremony was modest since it was Tiana's second marriage; she was widowed with two children from her previous marriage: Gabriel, born 1819, and Joanna, born 1822. She and Houston first met when she was ten years old, and he was stunned to see how beautiful she was when he returned to her village years later. The two lived together for several years. Tennessee society disapproved of the marriage because under civil law, he was still legally married to Eliza Allen Houston. After declining to accompany Houston to Texas in 1832, Tiana later remarried. She died in 1838 of pneumonia.<ref>Haley (2002), p. 70</ref> [[Will Rogers]] was her nephew, three generations removed.<ref>Marquis (1930), pp. 150-152.</ref>\n\nIn 1837, after becoming President of the Republic of Texas, he was able to acquire, from a district court judge, a divorce from Eliza Allen.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sam Houston and Eliza Allen: \u201cTen Thousand Imputed Slanders\u201d |url=https://www.tennesseehistory.org/sam-houston-eliza-allen-ten-thousand-imputed-slanders/ |publisher=The Tennessee Historical Society |accessdate=13 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1839, he purchased a horse which became one of the foundation sires of the [[American Quarter Horse]] breed named [[Copperbottom]].

His bride was 21-year-old [[Margaret Lea Houston|Margaret Moffette Lea]] of Marion, Alabama, the daughter of planters. They had eight children. Margaret acted as a tempering influence on her much older husband and convinced him to stop drinking. Although the Houstons had numerous houses, they kept only one continuously: Cedar Point (1840\u20131863) on [[Trinity Bay (Texas)|Trinity Bay]].{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nIn 1833, Houston was baptized into the Catholic faith in order to qualify under the existing Mexican law for property ownership in [[Coahuila y Tejas]]. The sacrament was held in the living room of the [[Adolphus Sterne House]] in Nacogdoches, Texas.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 104\u2013105</ref> By 1854, Margaret had spent 14 years trying to convert Houston to the Baptist church. With the assistance of [[George Washington Baines]], she convinced Houston to convert, and he agreed to adult baptism. Spectators from neighboring communities came to Independence, Texas to witness the event. On November 19, 1854, Houston was baptized by Rev. [[Rufus Columbus Burleson|Rufus C.

In 1980, Argos opened its Elizabeth Duke jewellery counter (named after a director's wife) and by 1982, was the United Kingdom's fourth-biggest jewellery retailer. The Elizabeth Duke brand has since been phased out and replaced with the \"Jewellery and Watches\" brand.\n\nThe company was demerged from BAT Industries and listed on the [[London Stock Exchange]] in 1990. In April 1998, it was then acquired by [[GUS (retailer)|GUS plc]].<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/business/60296.stm |title=Argos attacks GUS offer|publisher=BBC News|date=26 February 1998|accessdate=13 October 2009}}</ref> In October 2006, it subsequently became part of Home Retail Group which was demerged from its parent company, GUS plc, with effect from 10 October 2006.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb6602/is_200609/ai_n26021816|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080929184029/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb6602/is_200609/ai_n26021816|url-status=dead|archive-date=29 September 2008|title=GUS reveals demerger plans|publisher=Findarticles.com|date=2 June 2009|accessdate=13 October 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2016, the sale of sister company [[Homebase]] for \u00a3340 million was announced.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-35340384|title=Homebase bought by Australia's Wesfarmers for \u00a3340m|publisher=BBC|date=18 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2016, Argos' parent Home Retail Group agreed to a \u00a31.4 billion takeover by Sainsbury's, following a bidding war between the supermarket chain and South African conglomerate [[Steinhoff International]].<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\"/> The acquisition was completed on 2 September 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.retailgazette.co.uk/blog/2016/09/sainsburys-acquisition-of-argos-parent-company-now-complete|title=Sainsbury's acquisition of Argos parent company now complete|publisher=Retail Gazette|date=2 September 2016|accessdate=2 September 2016}}</ref> A large number of high street and retail park shops have since closed and moved into a nearby Sainsbury's shop.\n\n==Current operations==\n[[File:Argos, Salter Row, Pontefract (25th April 2019).jpg|thumb|right|An Argos branch in [[Pontefract]], [[West Yorkshire]].]]\nArgos is one of the UK's largest general merchandise retailers, operating both in stores and online.\n\n====Catalogue stores====\nArgos is most well known for its traditional high street catalogue stores. The Argos shopping process involves completing a small order form with the catalogue numbers of the desired items. Argos provides red [[pencil]]s (formerly small blue [[ballpoint pen]]s, then blue pencils) in shops for this purpose. The order form is taken to the checkout and the items paid for, then the customer is given a receipt which indicates where they should wait for their items to be brought to them from the storeroom. Additionally, \"Quick pay\" kiosks are also available to place orders and pay. Upon handover of the goods (if shopping using the catalogue number method), after receiving the receipt from the checkout and the item has been collected by the customer, the receipt is stamped \"RECEIVED\" by the shop to ensure that it cannot be re-used.\n\nIn October 2012, Argos announced that, as of 2013, that they would be closing a number of their catalogue shops. Thus fewer catalogues will be made available nationwide. This decision was made after a significant profit fall, and also to boost the popularity of their online shop. Claims, however, from the media that the shops themselves would change from their states are false.\n\nSince the acquisition of Argos by Sainsbury's, an increasing number of standalone stores have been moved into Sainsbury's supermarkets. On 25 September 2019, Sainsbury's announced that over 50 Argos stores would be closing or relocating in order to cut costs. Stores also now feature digital computers as well as catalogues to cater to all client bases.\n\n====Collection points====\nSince the 2016 Sainsbury's takeover, Argos Collection points have been installed inside smaller Sainsbury's supermarkets unable to accommodate a full in-store concession, and inside some [[Sainsbury's Local]] convenience stores, with 317 locations as of May 2019.\n\n===Online===\nDespite Argos being known as a high street catalogue retailer, around 58% of sales are now derived online, with the Argos website being the third most visited retail website in the United Kingdom. Customers can shop and pay for their items by the Argos website. The customer can either pay online and get the item either delivered or \"fast tracked\". However, if delivery is selected then the item(s) can be paid for and delivered.\n\n===Argos Financial Services===\nArgos Financial Services (formerly Argos Credit and Insurance) provides credit to enable the cost of purchases to be spread over a defined period of time. Since the Sainsbury's takeover of Argos, the Argos Financial Services division has been part of [[Sainsbury's Bank]].\n\n====Argos credit card====\nIn August 2006, [[Barclays]] and Argos announced a joint venture to produce an Argos credit card (in the same year Barclays also joined with [[Thomas Cook Group|Thomas Cook]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Barclays+Bank+and+Argos+in+credit+card+tie-up.-a0149979901|title=Barclays Bank and Argos in credit card tie-up.|work=thefreelibrary.com|accessdate=27 November 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.barclaycard.com/what-we-do/timeline.html |title=Barclaycard Timeline |work=barclaycard.com |accessdate=27 November 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140326105505/http://www.barclaycard.com/what-we-do/timeline.html |archivedate=26 March 2014  }}</ref> Argos cancelled its contract with [[Barclaycard]] and a new Argos credit card was announced in 2012, this time in conjunction with [[Vanquis Bank]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thesuncashback.co.uk/Argos_Credit_Card|title=The Sun Cashback Page is no longer available|work=thesuncashback.co.uk|accessdate=27 November 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.argos.co.uk/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CreditAndInsuranceView?langId=110&storeId=10151&page=Argos%20Credit%20Card|title=Argos Credit & Insurance \u2013 Argos Credit Card|work=argos.co.uk|accessdate=27 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Former operations==\n===HomeStore&More===\nDuring 2007, Home Retail Group launched a trial of five shops, branded '''HomeStore&More''', situated in [[Aylesbury]], [[Abingdon, Oxfordshire|Abingdon]], [[Cambridge]], [[Harlow]] and [[Cheltenham]].

The 'Extra' brand was phased out in 2010.]]\nAs part of the Autumn/Winter 2010 rebrand, all ''Argos Extra'' shops were planned to be branded simply as \"Argos\" when they are refitted. Former \"Extra\" marked lines will be available in all shops. However, stock levels will entirely depend on the area's demand for that particular line. If it does not sell, then the item will have to be ordered in to that shop. Argos shops in city centres will theoretically have a slightly different stocked-in range than those on [[retail park]]s.{{citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\nAs of 2018, a small number of older stores in operation remain unchanged with the original pre-2010 branding, store layouts and digital calculator-style computers, while others have received a modern revamp with new branding, store layouts, colour schemes and digital computers that are sometimes used for browsing items, as well as checking their stock limitations by entering the item number(s) shown in the catalogue.\n\n===Catalogues===\n{{update|type=section|date=November 2012}}\nArgos publishes catalogues twice a year (a spring/summer edition in January and an autumn/winter edition in July). Current editions{{when|date=January 2018}} have well over 1600 pages containing photographs of items, brief descriptions, prices and a catalogue number. Shop copies are ring-bound and the pages are individually laminated. Since the Autumn/Winter 2015 issue the catalogues are now reduced in size by 1.5x compared to previous issues published over the years.\n\nCatalogues are complemented by seasonal sales flyers, offering price reductions on existing deals. Other items are sometimes available in flyers, such as ex-catalogue goods at reduced prices, especially after the launch of a new catalogue.\n\nIn March 2006, Argos carried out a trial of a new catalogue branded Argos Home in over 100 shops in the United Kingdom. This proved successful, and on 5 August 2006, it launched the second Argos Home catalogue, this time in all 200 Argos Extra shops. The catalogue only contains home furniture and styling tips for the current season. Most items displayed in the Argos Home catalogue are also available in the main catalogue too. There are occasionally new lines in the Home catalogue which may not have been available at the time the main catalogue went to print. There is also a Christmas catalogue that is launched annually in October.\n\n==Charity partnerships==\nAs of July 2018, The official charity partner for Argos is The Alzheimer's Society.

Article dated 1 July 2002. Retrieved 4 March 2007.</ref> This action would have been illegal in the rest of the United Kingdom, as the [[Sunday Trading Act 1994]] gave shopworkers in England and Wales the right to refuse Sunday work (unless they were employed to work solely on a Sunday).\n\nThe 1994 Act did not apply to Scotland, as there was no legislation regarding Sunday trading applicable to Scotland. Although Argos later retracted its decision to sack the workers and to enforce a Sunday working clause in Scottish employee contracts,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/2407891.stm \"Argos Sunday working climbdown\"], BBC. Article dated 1 July 2002.

This was then changed during 2010, when employees' pay went from time and a half to the normal hourly rate.{{citation needed|reason=suggested|date=May 2012}}\n\n===Price fixing===\nIn May 2002, Argos, along with rival retailer [[Littlewoods Index]], was accused by the [[Office of Fair Trading]] of [[price fixing]] goods from toy manufacturer [[Hasbro]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1962341.stm \"Inquiry into toy 'price fixing'\"], BBC.

The Elizabeth Duke brand has since been phased out and replaced with the \"Jewellery and Watches\" brand.\n\nThe company was demerged from BAT Industries and listed on the [[London Stock Exchange]] in 1990.

The Argos shopping process involves completing a small order form with the catalogue numbers of the desired items. Argos provides red [[pencil]]s (formerly small blue [[ballpoint pen]]s, then blue pencils) in shops for this purpose. The order form is taken to the checkout and the items paid for, then the customer is given a receipt which indicates where they should wait for their items to be brought to them from the storeroom. Additionally, \"Quick pay\" kiosks are also available to place orders and pay. Upon handover of the goods (if shopping using the catalogue number method), after receiving the receipt from the checkout and the item has been collected by the customer, the receipt is stamped \"RECEIVED\" by the shop to ensure that it cannot be re-used.\n\nIn October 2012, Argos announced that, as of 2013, that they would be closing a number of their catalogue shops. Thus fewer catalogues will be made available nationwide. This decision was made after a significant profit fall, and also to boost the popularity of their online shop. Claims, however, from the media that the shops themselves would change from their states are false.\n\nSince the acquisition of Argos by Sainsbury's, an increasing number of standalone stores have been moved into Sainsbury's supermarkets. On 25 September 2019, Sainsbury's announced that over 50 Argos stores would be closing or relocating in order to cut costs. Stores also now feature digital computers as well as catalogues to cater to all client bases.\n\n====Collection points====\nSince the 2016 Sainsbury's takeover, Argos Collection points have been installed inside smaller Sainsbury's supermarkets unable to accommodate a full in-store concession, and inside some [[Sainsbury's Local]] convenience stores, with 317 locations as of May 2019.\n\n===Online===\nDespite Argos being known as a high street catalogue retailer, around 58% of sales are now derived online, with the Argos website being the third most visited retail website in the United Kingdom. Customers can shop and pay for their items by the Argos website. The customer can either pay online and get the item either delivered or \"fast tracked\".

Former \"Extra\" marked lines will be available in all shops. However, stock levels will entirely depend on the area's demand for that particular line. If it does not sell, then the item will have to be ordered in to that shop. Argos shops in city centres will theoretically have a slightly different stocked-in range than those on [[retail park]]s.{{citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\nAs of 2018, a small number of older stores in operation remain unchanged with the original pre-2010 branding, store layouts and digital calculator-style computers, while others have received a modern revamp with new branding, store layouts, colour schemes and digital computers that are sometimes used for browsing items, as well as checking their stock limitations by entering the item number(s) shown in the catalogue.\n\n===Catalogues===\n{{update|type=section|date=November 2012}}\nArgos publishes catalogues twice a year (a spring/summer edition in January and an autumn/winter edition in July). Current editions{{when|date=January 2018}} have well over 1600 pages containing photographs of items, brief descriptions, prices and a catalogue number. Shop copies are ring-bound and the pages are individually laminated. Since the Autumn/Winter 2015 issue the catalogues are now reduced in size by 1.5x compared to previous issues published over the years.\n\nCatalogues are complemented by seasonal sales flyers, offering price reductions on existing deals. Other items are sometimes available in flyers, such as ex-catalogue goods at reduced prices, especially after the launch of a new catalogue.\n\nIn March 2006, Argos carried out a trial of a new catalogue branded Argos Home in over 100 shops in the United Kingdom. This proved successful, and on 5 August 2006, it launched the second Argos Home catalogue, this time in all 200 Argos Extra shops. The catalogue only contains home furniture and styling tips for the current season. Most items displayed in the Argos Home catalogue are also available in the main catalogue too. There are occasionally new lines in the Home catalogue which may not have been available at the time the main catalogue went to print. There is also a Christmas catalogue that is launched annually in October.\n\n==Charity partnerships==\nAs of July 2018, The official charity partner for Argos is The Alzheimer's Society.

He is considered to be a spokesman for the young radicals living during [[World War I]]. His articles appeared in journals including ''[[The Seven Arts]]'' and ''[[The New Republic]]''. Bourne is best known for his essays, especially his unfinished work \"The State,\" discovered after he died. The essay is the source of the well-known phrase \"war is the health of the state,\" by which Bourne lamented governments' success at arrogating authority and resources during conflict. \n\n==Life and works==\n\nBourne's face was deformed at birth by misused forceps and the umbilical cord was coiled round his left ear, leaving it permanently damaged and misshapen. At age four, he suffered [[Pott disease|tuberculosis of the spine]], resulting in stunted growth and a hunched back.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Randolph-Silliman-Bourne|title=Randolph Silliman Bourne|last=|first=|date=|website=Encyclopaedia Britannica|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> He chronicled his experiences in his essay titled, \"The Handicapped - by one of them\", considered a foundational work in disability studies. At age 23, he won a [[scholarship to study at Columbia University, from which he graduated in 1912 with a Bachelor of Arts degree and a [[Master's degree]] in 1913. He was a journalist and editor of the Columbia Monthly, and he was also a contributor to the leftist weekly ''[[The New Republic]]'' since it was first launched in 1914, but after America entered the war, the magazine found his pacifist views incompatible. From 1913 to 1914, he studied in Europe on a Columbia Fellowship.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/archival/collections/ldpd_4079396/|title=Randolph Silliman Bourne Papers, 1910-1966|website=www.columbia.edu|access-date=2019-10-16}}</ref>\n\n[[World War I]] divided American progressives and pitted an anti-war faction\u2014including Bourne and [[Jane Addams]]\u2014against a pro-war faction led by [[pragmatism|pragmatist]] philosopher and educational theorist [[John Dewey]]. Bourne was a student of Dewey's at [[Columbia University|Columbia]], but he rejected Dewey's idea of using the war to spread democracy. (He was a member of the [[Boar's Head Society]].<ref name=chaddock>\n{{cite book\n | first = K\n | last = Chaddock\n | title = The Multi-Talented Mr. Erskine: Shaping Mass Culture through Great Books and Fine Music\n | publisher = Springer\n | page =\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ncFfAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22whittaker+chambers%22+%22boar%27s+head%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjO_IS0u6rLAhWDTCYKHSMOC5oQ6AEIOzAE#v=onepage&q=boar%27s&f=false\n | date = 2012\n | accessdate = 6 March 2016}}</ref>) In his pointedly titled 1917 essay \"Twilight of Idols\", he invoked the progressive [[pragmatism]] of Dewey's contemporary [[William James]] to argue that America was using democracy as an end to justify the war, but that democracy itself was never examined. Although initially following Dewey, he felt that Dewey had betrayed his democratic ideals by focusing only on the facade of a democratic government rather than on the ideas behind democracy that Dewey had once professed to respect.\n\nBourne was greatly influenced by [[Horace Kallen]]'s 1915 essay, \"Democracy Versus the Melting-Pot\". Like Kallen, Bourne argued that [[Americanism (ideology)|Americanism]] ought not to be associated with [[Anglo-Saxonism]]. In his 1916 article \"Trans-National America,\" Bourne argued that the United States should accommodate immigrant cultures into a \"cosmopolitan America,\" instead of forcing immigrants to assimilate to the dominant Anglo-Saxon-based culture.\n\nBourne was an enthusiast for [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s belief in the necessity of a [[general will]]. Bourne once exclaimed,<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Revolt Against the Masses: How Liberalism Has Undermined the Middle Class|last=Siegel|first=Fred|publisher=Encounter Books|year=2013|isbn=1594036985|location=New York|pages=18}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote|text=Yes, that is what I would have felt, done, said!

(1977). ''The Radical Will: Selected Writing of Randolph Bourne''. New York: Urizen Books.</ref>{{rp|248}} Bourne's view of nationality was related to the connection between a person and their \u201cspiritual country,\u201d<ref>Filler, L. \"Randolph Bourne\". American Council on public Affairs: Washington D.C.</ref> that is, their culture. He argued that people would most often hold tightly to the literature and culture of their native country even if they lived in another. He also believed this was true for the many immigrants to the United States. Therefore, Bourne could not see immigrants from all different parts of the world assimilating to the Anglo-Saxon traditions, which were viewed as American traditions.\n\nThis article goes on to say that America offers a unique liberty of opportunity and can still offer traditional isolation, which he felt could lead to a cosmopolitan enterprise.<ref name=\"LaschHansen\" />{{rp|262}} He felt that with this great mix of cultures and people, America would be able to grow into a trans-national nation, which would have interconnecting cultural fibers with other countries. Bourne felt America would grow more as a country by broadening people's views to include immigrants' ways instead of conforming everyone to the melting-pot ideal. This broadening of people's views would eventually lead to a nation where all who live in it are united, which would inevitably pull the country towards greatness. This article and most of the ideas in it were influenced by World War I, during which the article was written.<ref name=\"LaschHansen\" />{{rp|264}}\n\n==Randolph Bourne Institute==\nThe Randolph Bourne Institute seeks to honor his memory by promoting a [[non-interventionism|non-interventionist foreign policy]] for the United States as the best way of fostering a peaceful, more prosperous world.

He is considered to be a spokesman for the young radicals living during [[World War I]]. His articles appeared in journals including ''[[The Seven Arts]]'' and ''[[The New Republic]]''. Bourne is best known for his essays, especially his unfinished work \"The State,\" discovered after he died. The essay is the source of the well-known phrase \"war is the health of the state,\" by which Bourne lamented governments' success at arrogating authority and resources during conflict. \n\n==Life and works==\n\nBourne's face was deformed at birth by misused forceps and the umbilical cord was coiled round his left ear, leaving it permanently damaged and misshapen. At age four, he suffered [[Pott disease|tuberculosis of the spine]], resulting in stunted growth and a hunched back.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Randolph-Silliman-Bourne|title=Randolph Silliman Bourne|last=|first=|date=|website=Encyclopaedia Britannica|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> He chronicled his experiences in his essay titled, \"The Handicapped - by one of them\", considered a foundational work in disability studies. At age 23, he won a [[Scholarship|scolarship]] to study at Columbia University, from which he graduated in 1912 with a Bachelor of Arts degree and a [[Master's degree]] in 1913. He was a journalist and editor of the Columbia Monthly, and he was also a contributor to the leftist weekly ''[[The New Republic]]'' since it was first launched in 1914, but after America entered the war, the magazine found his pacifist views incompatible. From 1913 to 1914, he studied in Europe on a Columbia Fellowship.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/archival/collections/ldpd_4079396/|title=Randolph Silliman Bourne Papers, 1910-1966|website=www.columbia.edu|access-date=2019-10-16}}</ref>\n\n[[World War I]] divided American progressives and pitted an anti-war faction\u2014including Bourne and [[Jane Addams]]\u2014against a pro-war faction led by [[pragmatism|pragmatist]] philosopher and educational theorist [[John Dewey]]. Bourne was a student of Dewey's at [[Columbia University|Columbia]], but he rejected Dewey's idea of using the war to spread democracy. (He was a member of the [[Boar's Head Society]].<ref name=chaddock>\n{{cite book\n | first = K\n | last = Chaddock\n | title = The Multi-Talented Mr. Erskine: Shaping Mass Culture through Great Books and Fine Music\n | publisher = Springer\n | page =\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ncFfAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22whittaker+chambers%22+%22boar%27s+head%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjO_IS0u6rLAhWDTCYKHSMOC5oQ6AEIOzAE#v=onepage&q=boar%27s&f=false\n | date = 2012\n | accessdate = 6 March 2016}}</ref>) In his pointedly titled 1917 essay \"Twilight of Idols\", he invoked the progressive [[pragmatism]] of Dewey's contemporary [[William James]] to argue that America was using democracy as an end to justify the war, but that democracy itself was never examined. Although initially following Dewey, he felt that Dewey had betrayed his democratic ideals by focusing only on the facade of a democratic government rather than on the ideas behind democracy that Dewey had once professed to respect.\n\nBourne was greatly influenced by [[Horace Kallen]]'s 1915 essay, \"Democracy Versus the Melting-Pot\". Like Kallen, Bourne argued that [[Americanism (ideology)|Americanism]] ought not to be associated with [[Anglo-Saxonism]]. In his 1916 article \"Trans-National America,\" Bourne argued that the United States should accommodate immigrant cultures into a \"cosmopolitan America,\" instead of forcing immigrants to assimilate to the dominant Anglo-Saxon-based culture.\n\nBourne was an enthusiast for [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s belief in the necessity of a [[general will]]. Bourne once exclaimed,<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Revolt Against the Masses: How Liberalism Has Undermined the Middle Class|last=Siegel|first=Fred|publisher=Encounter Books|year=2013|isbn=1594036985|location=New York|pages=18}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote|text=Yes, that is what I would have felt, done, said!

American Council on public Affairs: Washington D.C.</ref> that is, their culture. He argued that people would most often hold tightly to the literature and culture of their native country even if they lived in another. He also believed this was true for the many immigrants to the United States. Therefore, Bourne could not see immigrants from all different parts of the world assimilating to the Anglo-Saxon traditions, which were viewed as American traditions.\n\nThis article goes on to say that America offers a unique liberty of opportunity and can still offer traditional isolation, which he felt could lead to a cosmopolitan enterprise.<ref name=\"LaschHansen\" />{{rp|262}} He felt that with this great mix of cultures and people, America would be able to grow into a trans-national nation, which would have interconnecting cultural fibers with other countries. Bourne felt America would grow more as a country by broadening people's views to include immigrants' ways instead of conforming everyone to the melting-pot ideal. This broadening of people's views would eventually lead to a nation where all who live in it are united, which would inevitably pull the country towards greatness. This article and most of the ideas in it were influenced by World War I, during which the article was written.<ref name=\"LaschHansen\" />{{rp|264}}\n\n==Randolph Bourne Institute==\nThe Randolph Bourne Institute seeks to honor his memory by promoting a [[non-interventionism|non-interventionist foreign policy]] for the United States as the best way of fostering a peaceful, more prosperous world.

[[David Guetta]] was the third to earn this distinction during the chart week of November 24, 2018, when \"(It Happens) Sometimes\", under his alias Jack Back, was number two, while his \"Don't Leave Me Alone\" collaboration with Anne-Marie was number three.<ref name=\"Kiss it Better\">{{cite web|last=Murray|first=Gordon|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/7453641/rihanna-26th-no-1-dance-club-songs-chart-kiss-it-better|title=Rihanna Gets Her 26th No. 1 on Dance Club Songs Chart With 'Kiss It Better'|work=Billboard|date=July 28, 2016|accessdate=September 20, 2016}}</ref>\n*[[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] is the only artist in the chart\u00b4s history to have 2 studio albums with 5 number-one songs each topping the chart, respectively; her eighth studio album [[Music (Madonna album)|Music]] and her ninth studio album [[American Life]].\n*The first [[12-inch single]] made commercially available to the public was \"[[Ten Percent (song)|Ten Percent]]\" by [[Double Exposure (band)|Double Exposure]] in 1976.<ref name=\"Billboard Hot Dance/Disco 1974-2003\"/>\n*The first number one on ''Billboard''{{'}}s Disco Action chart was \"[[Never Can Say Goodbye]]\" by [[Gloria Gaynor]] in 1974.<ref name=\"Billboard Hot Dance/Disco 1974-2003\"/>\n*The first number one on ''Billboard''{{'}}s National Disco Action Top 30 was \"[[You Should Be Dancing]]\" by the [[Bee Gees]] in 1976.<ref name=\"Billboard Hot Dance/Disco 1974-2003\"/>\n*Until February 2020, [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] has the record for most number-one songs in any Billboard chart with her record-extending 50 number-ones toping the Billboard Dance Club Songs Chart.\n*From the dance chart's inception until the week of February 16, 1991, several (or even all) songs on an [[extended play|EP]], [[album]] or 12-inch single could occupy the same position if more than one track from a release was receiving significant play in clubs (for example, Donna Summer charted several full-length albums, both [[Chaka Khan]] and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] have hit number one with remix albums).  Chart entries like this were especially prevalent during the [[disco]] era, where an entire side of an album would contain several songs segued together seamlessly to replicate a night of dancing in a club.  Beginning with the February 23, 1991 issue, the dance chart became \"song specific,\" meaning only one song could occupy each position at a time.<ref name=\"Billboard Hot Dance/Disco 1974-2003\"/>\n*Because of the former policy allowing multiple songs to occupy one position at the same time, there have been three instances when not only multiple songs were at number one, but the songs were performed by different artists.  In all scenarios this was due to the tracks being included in film [[soundtrack album]]s.

[[David Guetta]] was the third to earn this distinction during the chart week of November 24, 2018, when \"(It Happens) Sometimes\", under his alias Jack Back, was number two, while his \"Don't Leave Me Alone\" collaboration with Anne-Marie was number three.<ref name=\"Kiss it Better\">{{cite web|last=Murray|first=Gordon|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/7453641/rihanna-26th-no-1-dance-club-songs-chart-kiss-it-better|title=Rihanna Gets Her 26th No. 1 on Dance Club Songs Chart With 'Kiss It Better'|work=Billboard|date=July 28, 2016|accessdate=September 20, 2016}}</ref>\n*[[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] is the only artist in the chart\u00b4s history to have 2 studio albums with 5 number-one songs each topping the chart, respectively; her eighth studio album [[Music (Madonna album)|Music]] and her ninth studio album [[American Life]].\n*The first [[12-inch single]] made commercially available to the public was \"[[Ten Percent (song)|Ten Percent]]\" by [[Double Exposure (band)|Double Exposure]] in 1976.<ref name=\"Billboard Hot Dance/Disco 1974-2003\"/>\n*The first number one on ''Billboard''{{'}}s Disco Action chart was \"[[Never Can Say Goodbye]]\" by [[Gloria Gaynor]] in 1974.<ref name=\"Billboard Hot Dance/Disco 1974-2003\"/>\n*The first number one on ''Billboard''{{'}}s National Disco Action Top 30 was \"[[You Should Be Dancing]]\" by the [[Bee Gees]] in 1976.<ref name=\"Billboard Hot Dance/Disco 1974-2003\"/>\n*Until February 2020, [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] has the record for most number-one songs in any Billboard chart with her record-extending 50 number-ones toping the Billboard Dance Club Songs Chart.\n*From the dance chart's inception until the week of February 16, 1991, several (or even all) songs on an [[extended play|EP]], [[album]] or 12-inch single could occupy the same position if more than one track from a release was receiving significant play in clubs (for example, Donna Summer charted several full-length albums, both [[Chaka Khan]] and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] have hit number one with remix albums).  Chart entries like this were especially prevalent during the [[disco]] era, where an entire side of an album would contain several songs segued together seamlessly to replicate a night of dancing in a club.  Beginning with the February 23, 1991 issue, the dance chart became \"song specific,\" meaning only one song could occupy each position at a time.<ref name=\"Billboard Hot Dance/Disco 1974-2003\"/>\n*Because of the former policy allowing multiple songs to occupy one position at the same time, there have been three instances when not only multiple songs were at number one, but the songs were performed by different artists.  In all scenarios this was due to the tracks being included in film [[soundtrack album]]s.  In 1978, four tracks from ''[[Thank God It's Friday (soundtrack)|Thank God It's Friday]]'' ([[Donna Summer]], [[Pattie Brooks]], [[Love & Kisses]], [[Sunshine (American band)|Sunshine]]), in 1980, two tracks from ''[[Fame (soundtrack)|Fame]]'' ([[Irene Cara]], [[Linda Clifford]]) and in 1985 two songs from ''[[Beverly Hills Cop#Soundtrack|Beverly Hills Cop]]'' ([[Patti LaBelle]], [[Harold Faltermeyer]]) hit number one together.\n*[[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] additionally became the first act to have scored at least one No. 1 on [[Dance Club Songs]] chart in five separate decades since the chart's inception in 1976, having tallied 9 in the 1980s, 13 in the '90s, 18 in the 2000s, 9 in the '10s and, now, one (so far) in the '20s.\n*[[The Trammps]] are the only act to replace themselves at number one (issue date June 5, 1976, \"That's Where the Happy People Go\" \u2192 \"Disco Party\").<ref name=\"Billboard Hot Dance/Disco 1974-2003\"/>\n*The longest running number-ones on the Hot Dance Club Songs chart are \"[[Bad Luck (Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes song)|Bad Luck]]\" by [[Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes]]{{sup|2}} in 1975 and the album ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]'' by [[Michael Jackson]].
