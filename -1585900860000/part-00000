[[Orlando Police Department]] officers shot and killed him after a three-hour standoff.\n\nIn a [[9-1-1]] call made shortly after the shooting began, Mateen [[Bay'ah|swore allegiance]] to the leader of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]], [[Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi]], and said the U.S. killing of [[Abu Waheeb]] in Iraq the previous month \"triggered\" the shooting. He later told a negotiator he was \"out here right now\" because of the American-led interventions [[American-led intervention in Iraq (2014\u2013present)|in Iraq]] and [[American-led intervention in Syria|in Syria]] and that the negotiator should tell the United States to stop the bombing. The incident was deemed a [[terrorist attack]] by [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] investigators.\n\nPulse was hosting a \"Latin Night\", and most of the victims were [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic]]. It is the deadliest incident in the [[history of violence against LGBT people in the United States]] and the deadliest terrorist attack in the U.S. since the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001.

Two years later, she\u2019s the only indicted suspect for a crime that attracts a lot of media attention and has placed her in the center of the public eye.\n\nDolores spends her days preparing for the trial, secluded in her house as her parents work as a team ready to do anything to defend their daughter. The best lawyer is not enough, they obsessively control around her: how she looks, what she does, eats and who she sees.\n\nBut as the trial moves forward and pressure grows, suspicion and secrets emerge within the family. Cornered, increasingly isolated and just when any mistake could prove disastrous, Dolores puts the entire strategy at risk.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://filmfactoryentertainment.com/project/the-accused/|title=The Accused|website=Film Factory|accessdate=26 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Lali Esp\u00f3sito]] as Dolores Dreier<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/international/7934094/argentina-lali-esposito-interview|title=Lali Esposito Talks Getting Noticed in 'The Age of Song': Interview|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|first=Santiago|last=Torres|date=18 August 2017|accessdate=26 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin/8470843/lali-esposito-new-album-brava-track-by-track-review-interview|title=Lali Esposito Talks New Album, 'Brava,' & Track by Track Review|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|first=Santiago|last=Torres|date=17 August 2018|accessdate=26 August 2018}}</ref>\n* [[Leonardo Sbaraglia]] as Luis Dreier, Dolores' father\n* In\u00e9s Est\u00e9vez as Betina Dreier, Dolores' mother\n* Daniel Fanego as Ignacio Larocca, Dolores' lawyer\n* [[Gerardo Romano]] as Dr. Taboada, a public prosecutor\n* [[Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal]] as Mario Elmo\n* Lautaro Rodriguez as Lucas\n* Ana Garibaldi as Marisa\n* Martina Campos as Flo\n* Emilio Vodanovich as Martin Dreier, Dolores' younger brother\n\n==Release==\n''The Accused'' had its world premiere on 4 September 2018 at the [[75th Venice International Film Festival]], where it was selected as one of the twenty one films to compete for the [[Golden Lion]] award.<ref name=\"InComp1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/venice-film-festival-unveils-full-lineup-1129426 |title=Venice to Kick Off Awards Season With New Films From Coen Brothers, Luca Guadagnino and Alfonso Cuaron |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=25 July 2018|first=Ariston|last=Anderson}}</ref><ref name=\"InComp2\">{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/film/news/venice-film-festival-full-lineup-1202883737/ |title=Venice Film Festival Lineup: Heavy on Award Hopefuls, Netflix and Star Power |work=Variety |accessdate=25 July 2018|first=Nick|last=Vivarelli}}</ref> In the following months, the film also screened at multiple film festivals, including the [[2018 Toronto International Film Festival]], the [[23rd Busan International Film Festival]], and [[Morelia International Film Festival]], and the [[Miami International Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2018/08/tiff-2018-additional-titles-mid90s-boy-erased-hold-the-dark-1201993789/|title=TIFF Adds More High-Profile Titles, Including Jonah Hill\u2019s \u2018Mid90s,\u2019 \u2018Boy Erased,\u2019 \u2018Hold the Dark,\u2019 and Many More|website=[[IndieWire]]|accessdate=26 August 2018|date=14 August 2018|first=Kate|last=Erbland}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://moreliafilmfest.com/peliculas/acusada/|title=Acusada|website=[[Morelia International Film Festival]] (FICM)|accessdate=1 November 2018|language=Spanish}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2019/film/festivals/miami-film-festival-toni-morrison-documentary-ibero-american-cinema-1203154979/|title=Miami Film Festival Fetes Toni Morrison Documentary, Ibero-American Cinema|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=5 March 2019|accessdate=7 March 2019|first=Akiva|last=Gottlieb}}</ref> The film was released in Argentina on 13 September by [[Warner Bros.

It premiered at the [[75th Venice International Film Festival]] on 4 September and was released in Argentina on 13 September by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]]. The film has received critical acclaim, with praise for Lali Esp\u00f3sito's performance.\n\n==Plot==\nDolores lived the life of a higher-class student until her best friend was found brutally murdered. Two years later, she\u2019s the only indicted suspect for a crime that attracts a lot of media attention and has placed her in the center of the public eye.\n\nDolores spends her days preparing for the trial, secluded in her house as her parents work as a team ready to do anything to defend their daughter. The best lawyer is not enough, they obsessively control around her: how she looks, what she does, eats and who she sees.\n\nBut as the trial moves forward and pressure grows, suspicion and secrets emerge within the family. Cornered, increasingly isolated and just when any mistake could prove disastrous, Dolores puts the entire strategy at risk.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://filmfactoryentertainment.com/project/the-accused/|title=The Accused|website=Film Factory|accessdate=26 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Lali Esp\u00f3sito]] as Dolores Dreier<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/international/7934094/argentina-lali-esposito-interview|title=Lali Esposito Talks Getting Noticed in 'The Age of Song': Interview|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|first=Santiago|last=Torres|date=18 August 2017|accessdate=26 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin/8470843/lali-esposito-new-album-brava-track-by-track-review-interview|title=Lali Esposito Talks New Album, 'Brava,' & Track by Track Review|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|first=Santiago|last=Torres|date=17 August 2018|accessdate=26 August 2018}}</ref>\n* [[Leonardo Sbaraglia]] as Luis Dreier, Dolores' father\n* In\u00e9s Est\u00e9vez as Betina Dreier, Dolores' mother\n* Daniel Fanego as Ignacio Larocca, Dolores' lawyer\n* [[Gerardo Romano]] as Dr. Taboada, a public prosecutor\n* [[Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal]] as Mario Elmo\n* Lautaro Rodriguez as Lucas\n* Ana Garibaldi as Marisa\n* Martina Campos as Flo\n* Emilio Vodanovich as Martin Dreier, Dolores' younger brother\n\n==Release==\n''The Accused'' had its world premiere on 4 September 2018 at the [[75th Venice International Film Festival]], where it was selected as one of the twenty one films to compete for the [[Golden Lion]] award.<ref name=\"InComp1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/venice-film-festival-unveils-full-lineup-1129426 |title=Venice to Kick Off Awards Season With New Films From Coen Brothers, Luca Guadagnino and Alfonso Cuaron |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=25 July 2018|first=Ariston|last=Anderson}}</ref><ref name=\"InComp2\">{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/film/news/venice-film-festival-full-lineup-1202883737/ |title=Venice Film Festival Lineup: Heavy on Award Hopefuls, Netflix and Star Power |work=Variety |accessdate=25 July 2018|first=Nick|last=Vivarelli}}</ref> In the following months, the film also screened at multiple film festivals, including the [[2018 Toronto International Film Festival]], the [[23rd Busan International Film Festival]], and [[Morelia International Film Festival]], and the [[Miami International Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2018/08/tiff-2018-additional-titles-mid90s-boy-erased-hold-the-dark-1201993789/|title=TIFF Adds More High-Profile Titles, Including Jonah Hill\u2019s \u2018Mid90s,\u2019 \u2018Boy Erased,\u2019 \u2018Hold the Dark,\u2019 and Many More|website=[[IndieWire]]|accessdate=26 August 2018|date=14 August 2018|first=Kate|last=Erbland}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://moreliafilmfest.com/peliculas/acusada/|title=Acusada|website=[[Morelia International Film Festival]] (FICM)|accessdate=1 November 2018|language=Spanish}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2019/film/festivals/miami-film-festival-toni-morrison-documentary-ibero-american-cinema-1203154979/|title=Miami Film Festival Fetes Toni Morrison Documentary, Ibero-American Cinema|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=5 March 2019|accessdate=7 March 2019|first=Akiva|last=Gottlieb}}</ref> The film was released in Argentina on 13 September by [[Warner Bros.

The larval body is naked, hardly flattened, markedly tapered anteriorly and posteriorly, with all segments bulging out almost in a [[physogastrism|physogastric]] way. The head is small and [[Prognathism#In_insects|prognathous]]. The thoracal legs are well developed, the [[proleg]]s are strongly reduced, and only at high magnification the single circle of crochets and the small papilla are visible; the anal prolegs are completely reduced,<ref name=Roepke-1916/> but this may be due to the investigated larvae being in the process of pupation.<ref name=Kemner-1923/>\n\nThe fully-grown caterpillar of ''[[Niphopyralis aurivillii]]'' are 6 to 7.5 mm long and 1.5 mm thick, and is tapers only slightly towards the ends. The body has a yellow-white colour, with head and pronotum somewhat darker. The entire body is diffusely covered with long, soft, colourless chaetae. The head is about two thirds the breadth of the pronotum, almost twice as long as broad, and tapered towards the front. The two epicranial halves are almost triangular and encompass a large tongue-shaped frontal plate that reaches posteriad to the occipital opening. Each side of the head bears six ocelli, with the upper five in a curved line, and the sixth separate more ventral; the latter ocellus is not pigmented like the others. The larval antennae are consist of three merons. The mandibles long and conspicuously pointed in young larvae, more blunt in older larvae. The labium carries a well-developed [[spinneret]]. The thoracal and abdominal segments are weakly chitinised. The somewhat stronger chitinised pronotum is about twice as long as the meso- and metathorax. Thoracal legs are well-developed. Abdominal segments 1 to 7 are almost uniform, the eighth and ninth narrower, and the anal plate rounded. The four pairs of prolegs on abdominal segments 3 to 6 are well-developed, with a single, entire circle of crochets; half-grown larvae have 11 to 14 crochets, fully grown ones up to 25. The well-developed anal prolegs have an angularly curved frontal row of 11 crochets in falf-grown larvae and more in older ones.<ref name=Kemner-1923/>\n\n===Pupae===\nThe pupa is stout and slightly flattened.<ref name=Roepke-1916/> In ''[[Niphopyralis aurivillii]]'', the pupa is 6 to 6.5 mm long and 2 mm broad, and of a light brown-yellow colour. The [[imago]] emerges from a mouthlike cleft on one end of the cocoon.<ref name=Kemner-1923/>\n\n===Imagines===\n[[Imago|Imagines]] of ''Niphopyralis'' exhibit an unusual, somewhat [[Limacodidae]]-like [[habitus (biology)|habitus]]. Furthermore, they lack a [[proboscis]], have reduced palpi, and the males exhibit bipectinate antennae, a mix of characters that for a long time hindered their correct placement among [[Lepidoptera]] (see [[Niphopyralis#Systematics|Systematics]]).\n\nThe wingspan ranges from 12 to 22 mm, and the males being smaller than the females. The lower two thirds of the male [[antenna (biology)|antennae]] are bipectinate with ciliated teeth approximately as long as the antenna\u2019s breadth. The [[compound eye]]s are large and rounded. A [[proboscis]] and [[Simple_eye_in_invertebrates#Simple_eyes_in_arthropods|ocelli]] are absent, and the labial palps are small. The body and wings are whitish to cream, with the front wing upper side usually exhibiting a diffuse wing pattern, whereas the underside has a dark brown colour.\n\n==Behaviour==\nThe caterpillar of ''[[Niphopyralis myrmecophila]]'' lives in a flat oval self-spun casing consisting of two slightly curved halves that fit precisely onto one another. The halves are only loosely spun together, so that they can be easily separated. The casing tissue is relatively coarse. The outside colour is a dirty white, the inner side is lighter. The casing of a fully-grown caterpillar measures 15 x 11 mm, and the caterpillar is fully concealed by it. The larval cases seem to lie loosely in the nests of their host ants.<ref name=Roepke-1916/> Caterpillars of ''[[Niphopyralis aurivillii|N. aurivillii]]'' have also been observed to live freely in the nests, and only occasionally they are found on the nest ground, fixed by a loose weave of a few crossed threads. Fully-grown larvae are also found in pupal ant cocoons, where they feed on the ant pupa. However, for pupation they also spin a cocoon similar to that of ''[[Niphopyralis myrmecophila|N. myrmecophila]]''.<ref name=Kemner-1923/> The observations of Roepke (1916) on ''[[Niphopyralis myrmecophila|N. myrmecophila]]'' might therefore refer only to fully grown caterpillars, while the younger caterpillars potentially also live freely in the ant nests, but were not observed.\n\nThe caterpillars are fully tolerated in the nest, but are not cared for by the host ants. They actively participate in the maintenance of the ant nest by repairing and reinforcing walls with spinning thread. Small caterpillars live among eggs and small ant larvae on which they feed, as examinations of the gut contents have shown. Larger caterpillars are found among ant larvae and pupae. In cases where the ant colony is moving to a new nest, small caterpillars are carried passively to the new nest, but not actively by the ants, whereas large caterpillars remain in the old nest.<ref name=Kemner-1923/>\n\nThe adult moths are [[Diurnality|diurnal]]. The flight is neither fast nor lengthy, and with rapid wing movement. After settling down, the moth usually walks a short distance, with its wings held horizontally and skewed backwards. In resting position, the wings are normally held vertically, covering the body from the sides, and the [[Insect_morphology#Abdomen|abdomen]] is raised to approximately 45\u00b0. Like the caterpillars and pupae, the adults are not attacked by the ants.<ref name=Kemner-1923/>\n\n==Systematics==\nThe genus currently comprises eight species:<ref name=GlobIZ/>\n*''[[Niphopyralis albida]]'' <small>Hampson, 1893</small>\n*''[[Niphopyralis aurivillii]]'' <small>(Kemner, 1923)</small>\n*''[[Niphopyralis chionesis]]'' <small>Hampson, 1919</small>\n*''[[Niphopyralis contaminata]]'' <small>Hampson, 1893</small>\n*''[[Niphopyralis discipunctalis]]'' <small>Hampson, 1919</small>\n*''[[Niphopyralis myrmecophila]]'' <small>(Roepke, 1916)</small>\n*''[[Niphopyralis nivalis]]'' <small>Hampson, 1893</small> &ndash; [[type species]] of ''Niphopyralis''\n*''[[Niphopyralis suffidalis]]'' <small>Swinhoe, 1895</small>\n\nThe genus ''Niphopyralis'' was described by [[George Hampson]] in 1893, who placed it in the subfamily [[Pyraustinae]],<ref name=Hampson-1893>{{cite book |last=Hampson |first=George Francis |author-link=George Hampson |date=1893 |title=The Macrolepidoptera Heterocera of Ceylon.

The larval body is naked, hardly flattened, markedly tapered anteriorly and posteriorly, with all segments bulging out almost in a [[physogastrism|physogastric]] way. The head is small and [[Prognathism#In_insects|prognathous]]. The thoracal legs are well developed, the [[proleg]]s are strongly reduced, and only at high magnification the single circle of crochets and the small papilla are visible; the anal prolegs are completely reduced,<ref name=Roepke-1916/> but this may be due to the investigated larvae being in the process of pupation.<ref name=Kemner-1923/>\n\nThe fully-grown caterpillar of ''[[Niphopyralis aurivillii]]'' are 6 to 7.5 mm long and 1.5 mm thick, and is tapers only slightly towards the ends. The body has a yellow-white colour, with head and pronotum somewhat darker. The entire body is diffusely covered with long, soft, colourless chaetae. The head is about two thirds the breadth of the pronotum, almost twice as long as broad, and tapered towards the front. The two epicranial halves are almost triangular and encompass a large tongue-shaped frontal plate that reaches posteriad to the occipital opening. Each side of the head bears six ocelli, with the upper five in a curved line, and the sixth separate more ventral; the latter ocellus is not pigmented like the others. The larval antennae are consist of three merons. The mandibles long and conspicuously pointed in young larvae, more blunt in older larvae. The labium carries a well-developed [[spinneret]]. The thoracal and abdominal segments are weakly chitinised. The somewhat stronger chitinised pronotum is about twice as long as the meso- and metathorax. Thoracal legs are well-developed. Abdominal segments 1 to 7 are almost uniform, the eighth and ninth narrower, and the anal plate rounded. The four pairs of prolegs on abdominal segments 3 to 6 are well-developed, with a single, entire circle of crochets; half-grown larvae have 11 to 14 crochets, fully grown ones up to 25. The well-developed anal prolegs have an angularly curved frontal row of 11 crochets in falf-grown larvae and more in older ones.<ref name=Kemner-1923/>\n\n===Pupae===\nThe pupa is stout and slightly flattened.<ref name=Roepke-1916/> In ''[[Niphopyralis aurivillii]]'', the pupa is 6 to 6.5 mm long and 2 mm broad, and of a light brown-yellow colour. The [[imago]] emerges from a mouthlike cleft on one end of the cocoon.<ref name=Kemner-1923/>\n\n===Imagines===\n[[Imago|Imagines]] of ''Niphopyralis'' exhibit an unusual, somewhat [[Limacodidae]]-like [[habitus (biology)|habitus]]. Furthermore, they lack a [[proboscis]], have reduced palpi, and the males exhibit bipectinate antennae, a mix of characters that for a long time hindered their correct placement among [[Lepidoptera]] (see [[Niphopyralis#Systematics|Systematics]]).\n\nThe wingspan ranges from 12 to 22 mm, and the males being smaller than the females. The lower two thirds of the male [[antenna (biology)|antennae]] are bipectinate with ciliated teeth approximately as long as the antenna\u2019s breadth. The [[compound eye]]s are large and rounded. A [[proboscis]] and [[Simple_eye_in_invertebrates#Simple_eyes_in_arthropods|ocelli]] are absent, and the labial palps are small. The body and wings are whitish to cream, with the front wing upper side usually exhibiting a diffuse wing pattern, whereas the underside has a dark brown colour.\n\n==Behaviour==\nThe caterpillar of ''[[Niphopyralis myrmecophila]]'' lives in a flat oval self-spun casing consisting of two slightly curved halves that fit precisely onto one another. The halves are only loosely spun together, so that they can be easily separated. The casing tissue is relatively coarse. The outside colour is a dirty white, the inner side is lighter. The casing of a fully-grown caterpillar measures 15 x 11 mm, and the caterpillar is fully concealed by it. The larval cases seem to lie loosely in the nests of their host ants.<ref name=Roepke-1916/> Caterpillars of ''[[Niphopyralis aurivillii|N. aurivillii]]'' have also been observed to live freely in the nests, only occasionally they are found on the nest ground, fixed by a loose weave of a few crossed threads. Fully-grown larvae are also found in pupal ant cocoons, where they feed on the ant pupa. However, for pupation they also spin a cocoon similar to that of ''[[Niphopyralis myrmecophila|N. myrmecophila]]''.<ref name=Kemner-1923/> The observations of Roepke (1916) on ''[[Niphopyralis myrmecophila|N. myrmecophila]]'' might therefore refer only to fully grown caterpillars, while the younger caterpillars potentially also live freely in the ant nests, but were not observed.\n\nThe caterpillars are fully tolerated in the nest, but are not cared for by the host ants. They actively participate in the maintenance of the ant nest by repairing and reinforcing walls with spinning thread. Small caterpillars live among eggs and small ant larvae on which they feed, as examinations of the gut contents have shown. Larger caterpillars are found among ant larvae and pupae. In cases where the ant colony is moving to a new nest, small caterpillars are carried passively to the new nest, but not actively by the ants, whereas large caterpillars remain in the old nest.<ref name=Kemner-1923/>\n\nThe adult moths is [[Diurnality|diurnal]]. The flight is neither fast nor lengthy, and with rapid wing movement. After settling down, the moth usually walks a short distance, with its wings held horizontally and skewed backwards. In resting position, the wings are normally held vertically, covering the body from the sides, and the [[Insect_morphology#Abdomen|abdomen]] is raised to approximately 45\u00b0. Adults, like the caterpillars and pupae, are not attacked by the ants.<ref name=Kemner-1923/>\n\n==Systematics==\nThe genus currently comprises eight species:<ref name=GlobIZ/>\n*''[[Niphopyralis albida]]'' <small>Hampson, 1893</small>\n*''[[Niphopyralis aurivillii]]'' <small>(Kemner, 1923)</small>\n*''[[Niphopyralis chionesis]]'' <small>Hampson, 1919</small>\n*''[[Niphopyralis contaminata]]'' <small>Hampson, 1893</small>\n*''[[Niphopyralis discipunctalis]]'' <small>Hampson, 1919</small>\n*''[[Niphopyralis myrmecophila]]'' <small>(Roepke, 1916)</small>\n*''[[Niphopyralis nivalis]]'' <small>Hampson, 1893</small> &ndash; [[type species]] of ''Niphopyralis''\n*''[[Niphopyralis suffidalis]]'' <small>Swinhoe, 1895</small>\n\nThe genus ''Niphopyralis'' was described by [[George Hampson]] in 1893, who placed it in the subfamily [[Pyraustinae]],<ref name=Hampson-1893>{{cite book |last=Hampson |first=George Francis |author-link=George Hampson |date=1893 |title=The Macrolepidoptera Heterocera of Ceylon.

{"title_page": "Basel III", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2014}}\n{{Basel II}}\n\n'''Basel III''' (or the '''Third Basel Accord''' or '''Basel Standards''') is a global, voluntary regulatory framework on bank [[capital adequacy]], [[Bank stress tests|stress testing]], and [[market liquidity]] [[liquidity risk|risk]]. This third installment of the [[Basel Accords]] (''see [[Basel I]], [[Basel II]]'') was developed in response to the deficiencies in [[financial regulation]] revealed by the [[financial crisis of 2007\u201308]]. It is intended to strengthen bank [[capital requirement]]s by increasing bank liquidity and decreasing bank [[Leverage (finance)|leverage]].\n\nBasel III was agreed upon by the members of the [[Basel Committee on Banking Supervision]] in November 2010, and was scheduled to be introduced from 2013 until 2015; however, implementation was extended repeatedly to 31 March 2019 and then again until 1 January 2022.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bis.org/press/p100912.pdf |title=Group of Governors and Heads of Supervision announces higher global minimum capital standards |publisher=Basel Committee on Banking Supervision |date=12 September 2010 }}</ref><ref>[http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2012/10/24/1225821/and-now-for-some-basel-3-inspired-deleveraging/ Financial Times report Oct 2012]</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fsb.org/work-of-the-fsb/implementation-monitoring/monitoring-of-priority-areas/basel-iii/|title=Basel III \u2013 Implementation - Financial Stability Board|website=www.fsb.org|access-date=2019-03-21}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nThe Basel III standard aims to strengthen the requirements from the Basel II standard on bank's minimum capital ratios. In addition, it introduces requirements on liquid asset holdings and funding stability, thereby seeking to mitigate the risk of a [[run on the bank]].\n\n==Key principles==\n\n===Capital requirements===\nThe original Basel III rule from 2010 required banks to fund themselves with 4.5% of [[common equity]] (up from 2% in Basel II) of [[risk-weighted asset]]s (RWAs). Since 2015, a minimum Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio of 4.5% must be maintained at all times by the bank.<ref name=\"bis.org\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bis.org/bcbs/basel3/basel3_phase_in_arrangements.pdf |title=Phase 3 arrangements |website=www.bis.org}}</ref> This ratio is calculated as follows:\n\n:::<math> \\frac{\\mbox{CET1}}{\\mbox{RWAs}} \\geq 4.5\\% </math>\n\nThe minimum [[Tier 1 capital]] increases from 4% in Basel II to 6%,<ref name=\"bis.org\"/> applicable in 2015, over RWAs.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.riskbank.com.br/anexo/boletim0910.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=30 April 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211225008/http://riskbank.com.br/anexo/boletim0910.pdf |archive-date=11 December 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> This 6% is composed of 4.5% of CET1, plus an extra 1.5% of Additional Tier 1 (AT1).\n\nFurthermore, Basel III introduced two additional capital buffers:\n* A mandatory \"capital conservation buffer\", equivalent to 2.5% of risk-weighted assets. Considering the 4.5% CET1 capital ratio required, banks have to hold a total of 7% CET1 capital ratio, from 2019 onwards.\n* A \"discretionary [[counter-cyclical]] buffer\", allowing national regulators to require up to an additional 2.5% of capital during periods of high credit growth. The level of this buffer ranges between 0% and 2.5% of RWA and must be met by CET1 capital.\n\n===Leverage ratio===\nBasel III introduced a minimum \"leverage ratio\". This is a non-risk-based leverage ratio and is calculated by dividing Tier 1 capital by the bank's average total consolidated assets (sum of the exposures of all assets and non-balance sheet items).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs270.pdf |title=Report |website=www.bis.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allbankingsolutions.com/banking-tutor/basel-iii-accord-basel-3-norms.shtml|title=AllBankingSolutions.com -|website=AllBankingSolutions.com}}</ref> The banks are expected to maintain a leverage ratio in excess of 3% under Basel III.\n\n:::<math> \\frac{\\mbox{Tier 1 Capital}}{\\mbox{Total exposure}} \\geq 3\\% </math>\n\nIn July 2013, the [[U.S. Federal Reserve]] announced that the minimum Basel III leverage ratio would be 6% for 8 [[Systemically important financial institution]] (SIFI) banks and 5% for their insured bank holding companies.<ref>{{cite web |title=FDIC Publication|url=https://www.fdic.gov/regulations/safety/manual/section2-1.pdf}}</ref>\n\n===Liquidity requirements===\nBasel III introduced two required liquidity ratios.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs189.pdf |title=Basel Committee on Banking Supervision  |date=2010 |website=www.bis.org}}</ref>\n\n* The \"Liquidity Coverage Ratio\" was supposed to require a bank to hold sufficient high-quality liquid assets to cover its total net cash outflows over 30 days. Mathematically it is expressed as follows:\n\n:::<math> LCR=\\frac{\\mbox{High quality liquid assets}}{\\mbox{Total net liquidity outflows over 30 days}} \\geq 100\\% </math>\n\n* The [[Net Stable Funding Ratio]] was to require the available amount of stable funding to exceed the required amount of stable funding over a one-year period of extended stress.<ref>{{cite web |author=Hal S.

The proposal would require:\n* Large Bank Holding Companies (BHC) \u2013 those with over $250 billion in consolidated assets, or more in on-balance sheet foreign exposure, and to systemically important, non-bank financial institutions;<ref name=\"pwc.com\"/> to hold enough HQLA to cover 30 days of net cash outflow. That amount would be determined based on the peak cumulative amount within the 30-day period.<ref name=\"federalreserve.gov\"/> \n* Regional firms (those with between $50 and $250 billion in assets) would be subject to a \"modified\" LCR at the (BHC) level only. The modified LCR requires the regional firms to hold enough HQLA to cover 21 days of net cash outflow. The net cash outflow parameters are 70% of those applicable to the larger institutions and do not include the requirement to calculate the peak cumulative outflows<ref name=\"http\"/> \n* Smaller BHCs, those under $50 billion, would remain subject to the prevailing qualitative supervisory framework.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20131024a.htm|title=Federal Reserve Board proposes rule to strengthen liquidity positions of large financial institutions}}</ref>\n\nThe US proposal divides qualifying HQLAs into three specific categories (Level 1, Level 2A, and Level 2B). Across the categories, the combination of Level 2A and 2B assets cannot exceed 40% HQLA with 2B assets limited to a maximum of 15% of HQLA.<ref name=\"http\"/>\n* Level 1 represents assets that are highly liquid (generally those risk-weighted at 0% under the Basel III standardized approach for capital) and receive no haircut. Notably, the Fed chose not to include GSE-issued securities in Level 1, despite industry [[lobbying]], on the basis that they are not guaranteed by the \"[[full faith and credit]]\" of the U.S. government. \n* Level 2A assets generally include assets that would be subject to a 20% risk-weighting under Basel III and includes assets such as GSE-issued and -guaranteed securities.

This third installment of the [[Basel Accords]] (''see [[Basel I]], [[Basel II]]'') was developed in response to the deficiencies in [[financial regulation]] revealed by the [[financial crisis of 2007\u201308]]. It is intended to strengthen bank [[capital requirement]]s by increasing bank liquidity and decreasing bank [[Leverage (finance)|leverage]].\n\nBasel III was agreed upon by the members of the [[Basel Committee on Banking Supervision]] in November 2010, and was scheduled to be introduced from 2013 until 2015; however, implementation was extended repeatedly to 31 March 2019 and then again until 1 January 2022.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bis.org/press/p100912.pdf |title=Group of Governors and Heads of Supervision announces higher global minimum capital standards |publisher=Basel Committee on Banking Supervision |date=12 September 2010 }}</ref><ref>[http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2012/10/24/1225821/and-now-for-some-basel-3-inspired-deleveraging/ Financial Times report Oct 2012]</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fsb.org/work-of-the-fsb/implementation-monitoring/monitoring-of-priority-areas/basel-iii/|title=Basel III \u2013 Implementation - Financial Stability Board|website=www.fsb.org|access-date=2019-03-21}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nThe Basel III standard aims to strengthen the requirements from the Basel II standard on bank's minimum capital ratios. In addition, it introduces requirements on liquid asset holdings and funding stability, thereby seeking to mitigate the risk of a [[run on the bank]].\n\n==Key principles==\n\n===Capital requirements===\nThe original Basel III rule from 2010 required banks to fund themselves with 4.5% of [[common equity]] (up from 2% in Basel II) of [[risk-weighted asset]]s (RWAs). Since 2015, a minimum Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio of 4.5% must be maintained at all times by the bank.<ref name=\"bis.org\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bis.org/bcbs/basel3/basel3_phase_in_arrangements.pdf |title=Phase 3 arrangements |website=www.bis.org}}</ref> This ratio is calculated as follows:\n\n:::<math> \\frac{\\mbox{CET1}}{\\mbox{RWAs}} \\geq 4.5\\% </math>\n\nThe minimum [[Tier 1 capital]] increases from 4% in Basel II to 6%,<ref name=\"bis.org\"/> applicable in 2015, over RWAs.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.riskbank.com.br/anexo/boletim0910.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=30 April 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211225008/http://riskbank.com.br/anexo/boletim0910.pdf |archive-date=11 December 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> This 6% is composed of 4.5% of CET1, plus an extra 1.5% of Additional Tier 1 (AT1).\n\nFurthermore, Basel III introduced two additional capital buffers:\n* A mandatory \"capital conservation buffer\", equivalent to 2.5% of risk-weighted assets. Considering the 4.5% CET1 capital ratio required, banks have to hold a total of 7% CET1 capital ratio, from 2019 onwards.\n* A \"discretionary [[counter-cyclical]] buffer\", allowing national regulators to require up to an additional 2.5% of capital during periods of high credit growth. The level of this buffer ranges between 0% and 2.5% of RWA and must be met by CET1 capital.\n\n===Leverage ratio===\nBasel III introduced a minimum \"leverage ratio\". This is a non-risk-based leverage ratio and is calculated by dividing Tier 1 capital by the bank's average total consolidated assets (sum of the exposures of all assets and non-balance sheet items).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs270.pdf |title=Report |website=www.bis.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allbankingsolutions.com/banking-tutor/basel-iii-accord-basel-3-norms.shtml|title=AllBankingSolutions.com -|website=AllBankingSolutions.com}}</ref> The banks are expected to maintain a leverage ratio in excess of 3% under Basel III.\n\n:::<math> \\frac{\\mbox{Tier 1 Capital}}{\\mbox{Total exposure}} \\geq 3\\% </math>\n\nIn July 2013, the [[U.S. Federal Reserve]] announced that the minimum Basel III leverage ratio would be 6% for 8 [[Systemically important financial institution]] (SIFI) banks and 5% for their insured bank holding companies.<ref>{{cite web |title=FDIC Publication|url=https://www.fdic.gov/regulations/safety/manual/section2-1.pdf}}</ref>\n\n===Liquidity requirements===\nBasel III introduced two required liquidity ratios.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs189.pdf |title=Basel Committee on Banking Supervision  |date=2010 |website=www.bis.org}}</ref>\n\n* The \"Liquidity Coverage Ratio\" was supposed to require a bank to hold sufficient high-quality liquid assets to cover its total net cash outflows over 30 days. Mathematically it is expressed as follows:\n\n:::<math> LCR=\\frac{\\mbox{High quality liquid assets}}{\\mbox{Total net liquidity outflows over 30 days}} \\geq 100\\% </math>\n\n* The [[Net Stable Funding Ratio]] was to require the available amount of stable funding to exceed the required amount of stable funding over a one-year period of extended stress.<ref>{{cite web |author=Hal S.

The proposal would require:\n* Large Bank Holding Companies (BHC) \u2013 those with over $250 billion in consolidated assets, or more in on-balance sheet foreign exposure, and to systemically important, non-bank financial institutions;<ref name=\"pwc.com\"/> to hold enough HQLA to cover 30 days of net cash outflow. That amount would be determined based on the peak cumulative amount within the 30-day period.<ref name=\"federalreserve.gov\"/> \n* Regional firms (those with between $50 and $250 billion in assets) would be subject to a \"modified\" LCR at the (BHC) level only. The modified LCR requires the regional firms to hold enough HQLA to cover 21 days of net cash outflow. The net cash outflow parameters are 70% of those applicable to the larger institutions and do not include the requirement to calculate the peak cumulative outflows<ref name=\"http\"/> \n* Smaller BHCs, those under $50 billion, would remain subject to the prevailing qualitative supervisory framework.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20131024a.htm|title=Federal Reserve Board proposes rule to strengthen liquidity positions of large financial institutions}}</ref>\n\nThe US proposal divides qualifying HQLAs into three specific categories (Level 1, Level 2A, and Level 2B). Across the categories, the combination of Level 2A and 2B assets cannot exceed 40% HQLA with 2B assets limited to a maximum of 15% of HQLA.<ref name=\"http\"/>\n* Level 1 represents assets that are highly liquid (generally those risk-weighted at 0% under the Basel III standardized approach for capital) and receive no haircut. Notably, the Fed chose not to include GSE-issued securities in Level 1, despite industry [[lobbying]], on the basis that they are not guaranteed by the \"[[full faith and credit]]\" of the U.S. government. \n* Level 2A assets generally include assets that would be subject to a 20% risk-weighting under Basel III and includes assets such as GSE-issued and -guaranteed securities. These assets would be subject to a 15% [[Haircut (finance)|haircut]] which is similar to the treatment of such securities under the BCBS version. \n* Level 2B assets include [[corporate debt]] and equity securities and are subject to a 50% haircut. The BCBS and U.S. version treats equities in a similar manner, but corporate debt under the BCBS version is split between 2A and 2B based on public credit ratings, unlike the U.S. proposal. This treatment of corporate debt securities is the direct impact of the [[Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act|Dodd\u2013Frank Act]]'s Section 939, which removed references to [[credit ratings]], and further evidences the conservative bias of U.S. regulators\u2019 approach to the LCR.\n\nThe proposal requires that the LCR be at least equal to or greater than 1.0 and includes a multiyear transition period that would require: 80% compliance starting 1 January 2015, 90% compliance starting 1 January 2016, and 100% compliance starting 1 January 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/9f61345c-3cb1-11e3-a8c4-00144feab7de.html#axzz2jWZZfSmH|title=Subscribe to read|website=Financial Times}}</ref>\n\nLastly, the proposal requires both sets of firms (large bank holding companies and regional firms) subject to the LCR requirements to submit remediation plans to U.S. regulators to address what actions would be taken if the LCR falls below 100% for three or more consecutive days.\n\n==Implementation==\n\n===Summary of originally-proposed changes (2010) in Basel Committee language===\n* First, the quality, consistency, and transparency of the capital base will be raised.\n** [[Tier 1 capital]]: the predominant form of Tier 1 capital must be common shares and retained earnings\n** [[Tier 2 capital]]: supplementary capital, however, the instruments will be harmonised\n** Tier 3 capital will be eliminated.<ref>{{cite web |title= Strengthening the resilience of the banking sector |quote= Tier 3 will be abolished to ensure that market risks are met with the same quality of capital as credit and [[operational risk]]s. |url= http://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs164.pdf |page= 15 |date=December 2009 |publisher= BCBS }}</ref>\n* Second, the risk coverage of the capital framework will be strengthened.\n** Promote more integrated management of market and counterparty credit risk\n** Add the [[credit valuation adjustment]]\u2013risk due to deterioration in counterparty's credit rating\n** Strengthen the capital requirements for counterparty [[Derivative (finance)#Counter party risk|credit exposures arising from banks' derivatives]], repo and [[Security (finance)#Collateral|securities financing]] transactions\n** Raise the capital buffers backing these exposures\n** Reduce [[Procyclicality#Procyclical 2|procyclicality]] and\n** Provide additional incentives to move [[Derivative (finance)#OTC and exchange-traded|OTC derivative contracts]] to qualifying central counterparties (probably [[Clearing house (finance)|clearing houses]]).

To meet the capital requirements originally effective in 2015 banks were estimated to increase their lending spreads on average by about 15 [[basis points]]. Capital requirements effective as of 2019 (7% for the common equity ratio, 8.5% for the Tier 1 capital ratio) could increase bank lending spreads by about 50 [[basis points]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} The estimated effects on GDP growth assume no active response from monetary policy.

After the red grapes are crushed, their skins stay in contact for a period of 1 week to 1 month, and the wine gets a red or deep red color. Ros\u00e9, at least when ros\u00e9 wine is the primary product,  is produced with the skin contact method. It is made with red grapes. After the grapes are crushed, their skins only stay in contact a few hours before pressing, but give the wine already in that short period the characteristic light pink hue. White wine is made either with red or white grapes. The grapes are pressed and their skins are removed immediately. Because the grape skins do not \"participate\" in the fermentation, their color does not matter and the wine acquires a neutral, green to slightly yellow hue. Orange wine is made with white grapes.

The museum is located on a {{convert|100|acre|hectare|order=flip}} property in [[Kleinburg]], an unincorporated village in Vaughan. The property includes the museum's {{convert|85000|sqft|m2|order=flip}} main building, a sculpture garden, walking trails, and the cemetery for six members of the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]].\n\nThe collection dates back to 1955, when Robert and Signe McMichael began to collect works from artists associated to the Group of Seven, exhibiting their works at their home in Kleinburg. In 1965, the McMichaels formally reached an agreement to donate their collection collection and their Kleinburg property to the [[Government of Ontario]] in order to establish an art museum. The institution was opened to the public as the '''McMichael Conservation Collection of Art''' in 1966. The museum was formally incorporated into the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in 1972.

The museum is located on a {{convert|100|acre|hectare|order=flip}} property in [[Kleinburg]], an unincorporated village in Vaughan. The property includes the museum's {{convert|85000|sqft|m2|order=flip}} main building, a sculpture garden, walking trails, and the cemetery for six members of the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]].\n\nThe collection dates back to 1955, when Robert and Signe McMichael began to collect works from artists associated to the Group of Seven, exhibiting their works at their home in Kleinburg. In 1965, the McMichaels formally reached an agreement to donate their collection collection and their Kleinburg property to the [[Government of Ontario]] in order to establish an art museum. The institution was opened to the public as the '''McMichael Conservation Collection of Art''' in 1966. The museum was formally incorporated into the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in 1972.
