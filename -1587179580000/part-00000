The population for the city was 106,098 at the 2010 census.\n\nWest Covina is bordered by [[Covina, California|Covina]] to its north and east side. [[Baldwin Park, California|Baldwin Park]] is to the west, [[Irwindale, California|Irwindale]] to the northwest, [[La Puente, California|La Puente]] to the south, and [[Walnut, California|Walnut]] to the southeast.\n\n==History==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}\nWest Bovina was incorporated as an independent city in 1923 to prevent the city of [[Bovina, California|Bovina]] from building a sewage farm in the area. Benjamin Franklin Maxson, Jr., (1897-1928) initiated the incorporation process and was the first mayor.  Walnut groves and orange groves continued to flourish. The population in 1930 was 769 and blossomed to 1,549 in 1940. As a result of remarkable expansion during the post World War II building boom, West Bovina became one of the fastest-growing U.S. cities between 1950 and 1960, with the population increasing 1,000% from less than 5,000 to more than 50,000 citizens. The decades between 1960 and 2000 demonstrated steady growth, which slowed significantly by the time of the 2010 census.\n\nThe City of West Bovina began the second half of the 20th century with new developments and projects, mostly brought on by big business. The City Hall and police facility were built in 1969 as the first phase of an example of a Joint Powers Authority in the County of Los Angeles. The Civic Center Joint Powers Authority, consisting of the County of Los Angeles and the City of West Covina, also completed a three-level parking structure in the Civic Center complex. The Civic Center complex includes the Los Angeles County Regional Library and the Citrus Municipal Court building and the city offices.\n\nThe first Redevelopment Agency project included a regional shopping center, the West Covina Fashion Plaza, with three major department stores and 150 shops in an air-conditioned, enclosed mall. It also included the revitalization of the older sections of the shopping center. The Fashion Plaza has provided the citizens of the San Gabriel Valley with convenient access to all shopping needs. In 1991 the mall was renovated adding a food court and additional shops, as well as the redecorating of the entire mall. The mall was renamed \"The Plaza at West Covina\". The Plaza opened a new {{convert|100000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}. wing in October 1993 featuring 50 new stores including a new Robinson's-May and interior renovation throughout The Plaza.\n\nThe Redevelopment Agency's efforts have also resulted in several major office buildings in the city, such as \"The Lakes\", in addition to two new community shopping centers, freestanding retail developments, restaurants, residential projects, and the Auto Plaza.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1930= 769\n|1940= 1072\n|1950= 4499\n|1960= 50645\n|1970= 68034\n|1980= 80292\n|1990= 96086\n|2000= 105080\n|2010= 106098\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=106311\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=July 16, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\nThe [[2010 United States Census]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/2010census/popmap/ipmtext.php?fl=06:0684200|archive-url=https://archive.today/20140715033846/http://www.census.gov/2010census/popmap/ipmtext.php?fl=06:0684200|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 15, 2014|title=2010 Census Interactive Population Search: CA - West Covina city|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=July 12, 2014}}</ref> reported that West Covina had a population of 106,098.

The population for the city was 106,098 at the 2010 census.\n\nWest Covina is bordered by [[Covina, California|Covina]] to its north and east side. [[Baldwin Park, California|Baldwin Park]] is to the west, [[Irwindale, California|Irwindale]] to the northwest, [[La Puente, California|La Puente]] to the south, and [[Walnut, California|Walnut]] to the southeast.\n\n==History==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}\nWest Covina was incorporated as an independent city in 1923 to prevent the city of [[Covina, California|Covina]] from building a sewage farm in the area. Benjamin Franklin Maxson, Jr., (1897-1928) initiated the incorporation process and was the first mayor.  Walnut groves and orange groves continued to flourish. The population in 1930 was 769 and blossomed to 1,549 in 1940. As a result of remarkable expansion during the post World War II building boom, West Covina became one of the fastest-growing U.S. cities between 1950 and 1960, with the population increasing 1,000% from less than 5,000 to more than 50,000 citizens. The decades between 1960 and 2000 demonstrated steady growth, which slowed significantly by the time of the 2010 census.\n\nThe City of West Covina began the second half of the 20th century with new developments and projects, mostly brought on by big business. The City Hall and police facility were built in 1969 as the first phase of an example of a Joint Powers Authority in the County of Los Angeles. The Civic Center Joint Powers Authority, consisting of the County of Los Angeles and the City of West Covina, also completed a three-level parking structure in the Civic Center complex. The Civic Center complex includes the Los Angeles County Regional Library and the Citrus Municipal Court building and the city offices.\n\nThe first Redevelopment Agency project included a regional shopping center, the West Covina Fashion Plaza, with three major department stores and 150 shops in an air-conditioned, enclosed mall.

When Bosch corners the suspect, the suspect reached in his pocket and Bosch shot him dead. According to him, the suspect reached for a gun. Although cleared by the department, the family of the suspect sues Bosch in a wrongful death suit. Wanting to keep busy during the trial, Bosch gives two fellow detectives Lakers tickets to take the weekend shift. He takes a case when a doctor's ([[Scott Wilson (actor)|Scott Wilson]]) dog finds a child's bone. The finding of the bone leads to more bones and it was determined that it was a horribly-abused boy who died in 1989. During the investigation, Bosch meets rookie police officer Julia Brasher ([[Annie Wersching]]) and forms a connection with her. While in the morgue investigating the bones, the coroner details the abuse of the child and Bosch gets flashbacks of when he was abused as a child.\n |LineColor = EE714F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 2\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 2\n |Title = Chapter Two: Lost Light\n |DirectedBy = [[Kevin Dowling (director)|Kevin Dowling]]\n |WrittenBy = Tom Smuts & Eric Overmyer\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|2|13}}\n |ShortSummary = A patrol unit pulls over a van after finding the plates belong to another vehicle and officers discover a man's naked body in the back.  Meanwhile, Detectives Bosch and Edgar continue the investigation of the dead child by re-interviewing  neighborhood man Nicholas Trent ([[Rob Brownstein]]) who neglected to mention a previous conviction for pedophilia. Some children's items are found in a bin in Trent's home, which he explains away as part of his job as a set designer for movies.  After attaining Trent's consent to take a polygraph, the detectives leave but are accosted by a reporter who has been following Bosch. The reporter uses the threat of printing speculation to wrest a comment from Bosch. Bosch supplies, and records, a comment that a routine canvass of the neighborhood has been conducted, during which everyone interviewed has been cooperative, and no suspect has yet been identified. At his civil trial, Bosch is ambushed by accusations that he murdered his suspect because his own mother was a prostitute. Brasher spends the night with Bosch and over breakfast the next morning shows Bosch an online news article identifying Trent as a pedophile and naming him as a suspect in the child murder. Back at the county jail, the driver of the van, identified as Raynard Waits ([[Jason Gedrick]]), seeks a deal to avoid the death penalty by pleading guilty and revealing the locations of all the victims, including the child in Bosch's case.  Lieutenant Billets ([[Amy Aquino]]) tells Deputy Chief Irving ([[Lance Reddick]]) that Bosch believes his confidential personnel file was leaked to the attorney in the case against him by a Captain with a grudge against Bosch. Bosch receives a call from Trent's attorney, who thinks Trent is in police custody. After assuring the attorney that Trent is not in custody, Bosch and Edgar return to Trent's home and find that Trent has committed suicide by hanging.\n |LineColor = EE714F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 3\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 3\n |Title = Chapter Three: Blue Religion\n |DirectedBy = Kevin Dowling\n |WrittenBy = [[Diane Frolov]] & [[Andrew Schneider]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|2|13}}\n |ShortSummary = After viewing the scene Bosch and the journalist following him exchange words outside of Trent's house, with both accusing the other of being the reason for Trent's death. Bosch later goes to Brasher's apartment and attempts to warn her that her own maverick ways will get her fired, which leads to an argument where Bosch is told to leave. Deputy Chief Irving tries to get Bosch and Edgar to declare Trent murdered the boy in the hill but Bosch remains unconvinced, which further angers Captain Pounds. A tip from Sheila Delacroix, a woman with a missing brother, finally leads Bosch and Edgar to conclude the body is Arthur Delacroix, a runaway from a troubled home. District Attorney and political climber Rick O'Shea ([[Steven Culp]]) informs Bosch that Waits has confessed to Delacroix's murder and orders Bosch to confirm the story. Over drinks with DC Irving, Bosch is informed this may be a purely political maneuver by the DA in a run for mayor. Bosch apologizes to Brasher and they sleep together again. At the county jail, Waits reveals specific details of contents from Delacroix's backpack that only the police knew. Bosch, still unconvinced of Waits' guilt, is forced to wonder how Waits could have known.\n |LineColor = EE714F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 4\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 4\n |Title = Chapter Four: Fugazi\n |DirectedBy = [[Ernest Dickerson]]\n |WrittenBy = [[George Pelecanos]] & Michael Connelly\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|2|13}}\n |ShortSummary = Sergeant \"Mank\" Mankiewicz  ([[Scott Klace]]) tells Bosch that the officer who pulled over Waits, George Irving (who is also Deputy Chief Irving's son), may have done so illegally and George's partner Pierce wants to file a formal complaint. Bosch quietly talks to Pierce and convinces him that Waits is too much of a bad man to let him walk and promises to make sure Pierce gets a more by-the-book partner. Bosch and Edgar visit Delacroix's estranged mother ([[Mary Page Keller]]) and get definite confirmation the body is Arthur Delacroix. Bosch's trial is concluded and the jury finds for the plaintiff; however, the jury only fines Bosch one dollar. While the LAPD and his lawyer are pleased, Bosch is angered by the jury's decision. DC Irving orders Bosch to oversee a field trip where Waits will show the police and the DA where he killed his victims. O'Shea brings a camera crew to show off his leadership abilities. During the trip Waits taunts Bosch in the car and later purposely falls breaking his nose causing O'Shea to demand Waits be un-cuffed over Bosch's strenuous objections. Waits uses the opportunity to escape by stealing Detective Moore's gun and shooting Moore and a Deputy DA who O'Shea uses as a shield. O'Shea confiscates the video from the cameraman and provides DC Irving with a copy. Bosch swears to an injured Moore that he'll get Waits.\n |LineColor = EE714F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 5\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 5\n |Title = Chapter Five: Mama's Boy\n |DirectedBy = Ernest Dickerson\n |WrittenBy = William N.

Waits enters the house of an elderly woman (who turns out to be his mother) who calls him David. Waits asks his mother, who is unaware of his crimes, if he can spend Christmas with her and she happily agrees. Bosch and Edgar interview Delacroix's father Sam ([[Pat Skipper]]), during which a drunken Sam breaks down and declares that he killed his own son, but seems stunned by the abuse allegations. In a later interview Bosch becomes unconvinced of Sam's guilt. Bosch searches Sam's house and finds evidence Sam molested his daughter Sheila. At the end of the episode Waits picks up another male prostitute and murders him. \n |LineColor = EE714F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 6\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 6\n |Title = Chapter Six: Donkey's Years\n |DirectedBy = [[Roxann Dawson]]\n |WrittenBy = Jennifer Ames & Steve Turner\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|2|13}}\n |ShortSummary = Waits calls Bosch to ask about his options and tells Bosch they are similar. Bosch informs Waits he can rot in a cell, kill himself, or let the police kill him. Bosch tells Sam Delacroix it was impossible for him to kill Arthur because as a drunk he was physically unable to bury the body where it was found. Bosch reveals he knows Sam raped Sheila and Sheila must have taken out her pain on Arthur. Since Bosch can't arrest Sam he uses this to demand Sam to identify any of Arthur's old friends so he can get new leads. Brasher helps Bosch find a present for his teenage daughter until he receives another call from Waits. Waits taunts Bosch leading Bosch to another murder scene at a hardware store. Bosch heads to Las Vegas to visit his ex-wife Eleanor Wish ([[Sarah Clarke]]) and his daughter Maddie ([[Madison Lintz]]) for Christmas, but also wants Eleanor's skills as a former FBI profiler to get her opinion on Waits. While initially unwilling to help, Eleanor reviews the Waits case and concludes the name Raynard Waits comes from a French fairy tale and the items stolen from the hardware store were for a lair. Irving informs DA O'Shea he has the video of the Waits field trip and makes a tentative alliance to assure O'Shea becomes mayor and Irving becomes Chief. While in Las Vegas, Bosch is informed of a potential lead in the Delacroix case involving Johnny Stokes ([[Shawn Hatosy]]), and Bosch immediately returns to Los Angeles. While pursuing Stokes, Officer Brasher is shot in the ribs (although protected by her bullet-resistant vest) and she claims Stokes did it in a struggle. Bosch is certain he saw Brasher accidentally shoot herself, which if true would be the final mark on her record to fire her.\n |LineColor = EE714F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 7\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 7\n |Title = Chapter Seven: Lost Boys\n |DirectedBy = [[Alex Zakrzewski]]\n |WrittenBy = Joe Gonzalez & Eric Overmyer\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|2|13}}\n |ShortSummary = Bosch interviews Stokes about Delacroix, but only comes away more convinced that Stokes didn't shoot Brasher. Visiting Lieutenant Billets at her home for advice on Brasher's shooting leaves Bosch convinced he has to tell the truth no matter the consequences. Bosch revisits Brasher to tell her he knows the truth about the shooting, and Brasher calls Bosch a hypocrite. Bosch has Stokes released to spare the LAPD potential embarrassment. Waits attempts to pick up a man on the highway only to fail to kill him, which leads DC Irving to assign Bosch to find Waits independent of Captain Pounds' task force. Bosch searches Waits' last known address and finds evidence of Waits' obsession with old Parisian catacombs and skulls, which leads Eleanor to speculate that Waits may be building an underground monument of his own. After Edgar reviews footage of a conversation with Waits, Bosch realizes he and Waits were both in the same orphanage giving Bosch his first lead on Waits' real identity. Waits murders his sick mother, telling her that he loves her.\n |LineColor = EE714F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 8\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 8\n |Title = Chapter Eight: High Low\n |DirectedBy = [[Matt Earl Beesley]]\n |WrittenBy = William N.

Captain Pounds informs Brasher her statement about Stokes is a lie and implies he'll back her if she reports Bosch for sexual harassment. DC Irving approaches a powerful voice in the African-American community, Reverend Ott ([[Peter Macon]]), about backing Rick O'Shea for mayor in return for Irving becoming Chief and Ott given a seat on the police commission. A county coroner admits to Bosch that Waits called him from jail and tricked him into giving up information about what was in Delacroix's backpack, which eventually led to Waits' escape. Brasher is reassigned to Bosch's precinct to both of their disappointment. A new lead in the Delacroix case suggests Trent really did kill the boy but on further review convinces Bosch that Stokes actually killed Delacroix for his skateboard. A murder of a prostitute is very similar to his own mother's murder, which draws Bosch back into the Waits case. Waits calls Bosch to continue to taunt him. \n |LineColor = EE714F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 9\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 9\n |Title = Chapter Nine: The Magic Castle\n |DirectedBy = Alex Zakrzewski\n |WrittenBy = Diane Frolov & Andrew Schneider\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|2|13}}\n |ShortSummary = Edgar informs an angry rank and file that Stokes is wanted for Delacroix's murder, which forces both Mank and Edgar to defend Bosch. Bosch and Billets meet for a drink where Billets admits she also is in a compromising relationship with someone under her command. Waits calls Bosch again to tell him it's all coming to an end. Bosch replies that he knows all of the secrets Waits tried to taunt him with. Waits kidnaps a young mother, leaving a note in her child's stroller in order to taunt Bosch. Bosch calls Eleanor for help, and she tells Bosch the mother is bait for him. Using the files from the orphanage Bosch and Edgar track down Waits to a shed. While Edgar calls for backup, Bosch finds a secret tunnel where Waits has his hostage. After a heated exchange of words Waits throws his hostage aside and aims a gun at Bosch, which forces Bosch to kill him. In the aftermath, Captain Pounds orders his subordinates to tell the media Pounds' task force found Waits. Bosch calls Eleanor to tell her what happened and to ask about Maddie. DC Irving informs Bosch that Waits' gun was unloaded to which Bosch simply replies, \u201cSuicide by cop.\u201d\n |LineColor = EE714F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 10\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 10\n |Title = Chapter Ten: Us and Them\n |DirectedBy = [[Thomas Carter (director)|Thomas Carter]]\n |WrittenBy = Michael Connelly & T.L.

Arthur Delacroix's remains are buried leading Sheila to express her anger that Bosch knows what happened to her. DA O'Shea opens a grand jury hearing against the LAPD to ensure Irving's blackmail video of the Waits escape is neutralized. Eleanor calls Bosch to tell him Maddie has run away to LA. Bosch finds Maddie at the bus station and chastises her but is also happy for a chance to spend time with her. Edgar continues to look into Stokes and finds him working as muscle for a slumlord. Leaving Maddie with a colleague, Bosch joins Edgar to chase Stokes. After being caught, Stokes claims Delacroix's death was an accident despite the coroner's report. Bosch returns to Maddie and when she asks, he explains his past to her and she begins to understand him. Stokes is released since he was a juvenile when he killed Delacroix. Captain Pounds approaches Bosch to shame him for not jailing Stokes, but Bosch warns Pounds to leave him alone. Pounds grabs Bosch's arm and Bosch shoves Pounds through a window in front of Mank. Pounds screams that Bosch will regret that incident but Bosch walks away, happy enough that he'll now spend time with his daughter. Bosch turns in his gun and badge to Billets and goes home, only to be called later by Edgar. Sam Delacroix has murdered Stokes. Bosch approaches Sam and asks him if he felt absolved for all he had done but Billets stops Bosch from possible issues in the future.\n |LineColor = EE714F\n}}\n}}\n\n===Season 2 (2016)===\n{{Episode table |background=#221F54 |overall=5 |season=5 |title= |director= |writer= |airdate= |released=y|episodes=\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 11\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 1\n |Title = Trunk Music\n |DirectedBy = [[Alex Zakrzewski]]\n |WrittenBy = [[Eric Overmyer]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|3|11}}\n |ShortSummary = Bosch has been suspended for six months following his incident with Captain Pounds. During that time Bosch was able to grow closer to his daughter Maddie but is largely unchanged.  O'Shea, Irving, and Reverend Ott continue to plan O'Shea's run for mayor and O'Shea's grand jury continues to work under the assumption that Bosch is to blame for the Raynard Waits fiasco. Billets assigns Bosch to a case of a dead body in a car trunk. The body is identified as Anthony Allen ([[Ludwig Manukian]]), a pornographer recently returned from Las Vegas. Chief Irving lies to his wife Connie ([[Erika Alexander]]) about their son, George Irving ([[Robbie Jones (actor)|Robbie Jones]]), telling her George is working a desk job when he is actually working undercover for Internal Affairs investigating Narcotics Detective Eddie Arceneaux ([[James Ransone]]). Bosch and Edgar go to inform Veronica Allen ([[Jeri Ryan]]) and find Carl Nash ([[Brent Sexton]]), a former LAPD detective who resigned after an IA investigation, is running security at the Allen's gated community. Veronica informs Bosch and Edgar that Tony had a string of girlfriends but has no clue why Tony was dead. Billets' search of Tony's car reveals a secret compartment with over two hundred thousand dollars in cash. Bosch and Edgar search Tony's office and find a hidden camera.

Attempts to get information about Allen's death are blocked by Special Agent Griffin ([[John Marshall Jones]]) who only tells them Allen was a minor player in a \"National Security\" case. George Irving continues working with Arceneaux who is careful to not show any of his shakedowns on camera. Bosch receives a call from a reporter who tells him a woman has contacted her about the murder of Bosch's mother. Bosch dismisses the claims as someone just wanting attention. Edgar finds paperwork showing Tony Allen changed his name and was previously a member of an Armenian street gang which has evolved into a criminal empire. Bosch and Billets meet for a drink where Billets reveals her own relationship has ended. Mayor Ramos ([[Yancey Arias]]) meets with Irving to warn him that the Mayor's office knows what Irving, O'Shea, and Ott are planning and asks Irving to support Ramos instead. Irving tells Ramos that he'll pray on it. Edgar deduces Allen was a money launderer for his former Armenian gang. Bosch approaches Veronica Allen who says she suspected the money laundering but since she didn't speak Armenian she didn't know anything else. Bosch asks Edgar to find anyone who can tell them anything about Veronica's character. \n |LineColor = 221F54\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 13\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 3\n |Title = Victim of the Night\n |DirectedBy = [[Pieter Jan Brugge]]\n |WrittenBy = [[Diane Frolov]] & [[Andrew Schneider]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|3|11}}\n |ShortSummary = Bosch heads to Las Vegas to track Tony Allen's movements the days before he died. Deputy Chief Irving advises his son George that having fear about his assignment would not be a bad thing. In a later meeting with his handler, George states doubts that Arceneaux is part of a larger group but his handler disagrees. Edgar finds people who knew Veronica and they all say she's manipulative. Bosch is partnered in Las Vegas with Detective Iverson who tells him Allen could have been working for Joey Marks ([[Tom Mardirosian]]), an Armenian gangster that the LVPD wants to take down. Bosch takes time to see Maddie who informs him that Eleanor's current husband may have left her and Eleanor is starting to become unhinged. That night Bosch goes to Allen's favorite strip club in an attempt to locate Layla, Allen's current girlfriend, but draws the attention of the club's manager Luke Rykov ([[Matthew Lillard]]). Rykov denies he works for Marks, knows Layla, or knows anything about Allen's death but after he has Bosch thrown out he calls someone and speaks in Armenian. Bosch visit's Eleanor's house and also starts becoming concerned for his ex-wife's well being. He becomes even more concerned when a casino security video shows Eleanor playing poker with Tony Allen days before his death. The next day O'Shea announces his candidacy for mayor with Ott and Irving's endorsement. Angered by the announcement, Ramos and his campaign manager Jen Kowski plan to send a message. Bosch confronts Eleanor about the security video leading to a heated argument and Eleanor ordering him out of her house. \n |LineColor = 221F54\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 14\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 4\n |Title = Who's Lucky Now?\n |DirectedBy = [[Christine Moore (director)|Christine Moore]]\n |WrittenBy = Tom Smuts\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|3|11}}\n |ShortSummary = Detective Iverson calls Bosch to tell him Rykov's prints were on Allen's body and they have a search warrant.

O'Grady encourages George to get closer to his father to leak information to her. The LVPD reveals Eleanor has minor ties to Marks and uses this to force Bosch to agree to a joint investigation. Eleanor admits that she borrowed money from a loan shark to pay off gambling debts once but long ago paid off her debt. Edgar meets with a detective in the gang unit who tells him Marks and Allen are actually cousins and Marks has dealings with several terrorist organizations. Bosch and Iverson attempt to interrogate Rykov who angrily accuses them of planting the gun. The next day Marks and his attorney, Martin Weiss ([[Christopher Cousins]]), approach Bosch with proof Rykov was in Las Vegas when Allen was murdered and to offer a bribe to exchange the gun found in Rykov's house. Bosch refuses and Marks threatens him. Bosch goes to Eleanor to attempt to mend fences but ends up in another fight. DC Irving informs Lt. Billets that the Mayor is using current Chief Tensor to harass O'Shea donors and asks Billets to be a supporter of Irving becoming Chief. Bosch returns to Los Angeles to find Agent Griffin giving Billets proof that Rykov was in Los Angeles when Tony Allen was murdered. Bosch and Edgar go to inform Veronica Allen of Rykov's arrest and run into Carl Nash who implies he knew Allen had to be a mobster.

While Edgar wants to report the kidnapping to the local police he defers to Bosch who was warned to not involve the police.

Rykov identifies the kidnappers and gives Bosch a location. Bosch and Edgar take down the kidnappers and rescue Eleanor and Maddie. Eleanor begs Bosch to not make an official report because she doesn't want Maddie in the middle of a mob trial. Bosch agrees on the condition they stay with him in Los Angeles until the case is over. In court Rykov doesn't challenge the extradition and Bosch tells Marks' attorney Martin Weiss that he'll cripple Marks if Marks ever goes after his family again. George joins Arceneaux and O'Grady's crew in ripping off a drug stash house. Afterwards he's introduced to their boss, Nash.

When Bosch corners the suspect, the suspect reached in his pocket and Bosch shot him dead. According to him, the suspect reached for a gun. Although cleared by the department, the family of the suspect sues Bosch in a wrongful death suit. Wanting to keep busy during the trial, Bosch gives two fellow detectives Lakers tickets to take the weekend shift. He takes a case when a doctor's ([[Scott Wilson (actor)|Scott Wilson]]) dog finds a child's bone. The finding of the bone leads to more bones and it was determined that it was a horribly-abused boy who died in 1989. During the investigation, Bosch meets rookie police officer Julia Brasher ([[Annie Wersching]]) and forms a connection with her. While in the morgue investigating the bones, the coroner details the abuse of the child and Bosch gets flashbacks of when he was abused as a child.\n |LineColor = EE714F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 2\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 2\n |Title = Chapter Two: Lost Light\n |DirectedBy = [[Kevin Dowling (director)|Kevin Dowling]]\n |WrittenBy = Tom Smuts & Eric Overmyer\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|2|13}}\n |ShortSummary = A patrol unit pulls over a van after finding the plates belong to another vehicle and officers discover a man's naked body in the back.  Meanwhile, Detectives Bosch and Edgar continue the investigation of the dead child by re-interviewing  neighborhood man Nicholas Trent ([[Rob Brownstein]]) who neglected to mention a previous conviction for pedophilia. Some children's items are found in a bin in Trent's home, which he explains away as part of his job as a set designer for movies.  After attaining Trent's consent to take a polygraph, the detectives leave but are accosted by a reporter who has been following Bosch. The reporter uses the threat of printing speculation to wrest a comment from Bosch. Bosch supplies, and records, a comment that a routine canvass of the neighborhood has been conducted, during which everyone interviewed has been cooperative, and no suspect has yet been identified. At his civil trial, Bosch is ambushed by accusations that he murdered his suspect because his own mother was a prostitute. Brasher spends the night with Bosch and over breakfast the next morning shows Bosch an online news article identifying Trent as a pedophile and naming him as a suspect in the child murder. Back at the county jail, the driver of the van, identified as Raynard Waits ([[Jason Gedrick]]), seeks a deal to avoid the death penalty by pleading guilty and revealing the locations of all the victims, including the child in Bosch's case.  Lieutenant Billets ([[Amy Aquino]]) tells Deputy Chief Irving ([[Lance Reddick]]) that Bosch believes his confidential personnel file was leaked to the attorney in the case against him by a Captain with a grudge against Bosch. Bosch receives a call from Trent's attorney, who thinks Trent is in police custody. After assuring the attorney that Trent is not in custody, Bosch and Edgar return to Trent's home and find that Trent has committed suicide by hanging.\n |LineColor = EE714F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 3\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 3\n |Title = Chapter Three: Blue Religion\n |DirectedBy = Kevin Dowling\n |WrittenBy = [[Diane Frolov]] & [[Andrew Schneider]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|2|13}}\n |ShortSummary = After viewing the scene Bosch and the journalist following him exchange words outside of Trent's house, with both accusing the other of being the reason for Trent's death. Bosch later goes to Brasher's apartment and attempts to warn her that her own maverick ways will get her fired, which leads to an argument where Bosch is told to leave. Deputy Chief Irving tries to get Bosch and Edgar to declare Trent murdered the boy in the hill but Bosch remains unconvinced, which further angers Captain Pounds. A tip from Sheila Delacroix, a woman with a missing brother, finally leads Bosch and Edgar to conclude the body is Arthur Delacroix, a runaway from a troubled home. District Attorney and political climber Rick O'Shea ([[Steven Culp]]) informs Bosch that Waits has confessed to Delacroix's murder and orders Bosch to confirm the story. Over drinks with DC Irving, Bosch is informed this may be a purely political maneuver by the DA in a run for mayor. Bosch apologizes to Brasher and they sleep together again. At the county jail, Waits reveals specific details of contents from Delacroix's backpack that only the police knew. Bosch, still unconvinced of Waits' guilt, is forced to wonder how Waits could have known.\n |LineColor = EE714F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 4\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 4\n |Title = Chapter Four: Fugazi\n |DirectedBy = [[Ernest Dickerson]]\n |WrittenBy = [[George Pelecanos]] & Michael Connelly\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|2|13}}\n |ShortSummary = Sergeant \"Mank\" Mankiewicz  ([[Scott Klace]]) tells Bosch that the officer who pulled over Waits, George Irving (who is also Deputy Chief Irving's son), may have done so illegally and George's partner Pierce wants to file a formal complaint. Bosch quietly talks to Pierce and convinces him that Waits is too much of a bad man to let him walk and promises to make sure Pierce gets a more by-the-book partner. Bosch and Edgar visit Delacroix's estranged mother ([[Mary Page Keller]]) and get definite confirmation the body is Arthur Delacroix. Bosch's trial is concluded and the jury finds for the plaintiff; however, the jury only fines Bosch one dollar. While the LAPD and his lawyer are pleased, Bosch is angered by the jury's decision. DC Irving orders Bosch to oversee a field trip where Waits will show the police and the DA where he killed his victims. O'Shea brings a camera crew to show off his leadership abilities. During the trip Waits taunts Bosch in the car and later purposely falls breaking his nose causing O'Shea to demand Waits be un-cuffed over Bosch's strenuous objections. Waits uses the opportunity to escape by stealing Detective Moore's gun and shooting Moore and a Deputy DA who O'Shea uses as a shield. O'Shea confiscates the video from the cameraman and provides DC Irving with a copy. Bosch swears to an injured Moore that he'll get Waits.\n |LineColor = EE714F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 5\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 5\n |Title = Chapter Five: Mama's Boy\n |DirectedBy = Ernest Dickerson\n |WrittenBy = William N.

Waits enters the house of an elderly woman (who turns out to be his mother) who calls him David. Waits asks his mother, who is unaware of his crimes, if he can spend Christmas with her and she happily agrees. Bosch and Edgar interview Delacroix's father Sam ([[Pat Skipper]]), during which a drunken Sam breaks down and declares that he killed his own son, but seems stunned by the abuse allegations. In a later interview Bosch becomes unconvinced of Sam's guilt. Bosch searches Sam's house and finds evidence Sam molested his daughter Sheila. At the end of the episode Waits picks up another male prostitute and murders him. \n |LineColor = EE714F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 6\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 6\n |Title = Chapter Six: Donkey's Years\n |DirectedBy = [[Roxann Dawson]]\n |WrittenBy = Jennifer Ames & Steve Turner\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|2|13}}\n |ShortSummary = Waits calls Bosch to ask about his options and tells Bosch they are similar. Bosch informs Waits he can rot in a cell, kill himself, or let the police kill him. Bosch tells Sam Delacroix it was impossible for him to kill Arthur because as a drunk he was physically unable to bury the body where it was found. Bosch reveals he knows Sam raped Sheila and Sheila must have taken out her pain on Arthur. Since Bosch can't arrest Sam he uses this to demand Sam to identify any of Arthur's old friends so he can get new leads. Brasher helps Bosch find a present for his teenage daughter until he receives another call from Waits. Waits taunts Bosch leading Bosch to another murder scene at a hardware store. Bosch heads to Las Vegas to visit his ex-wife Eleanor Wish ([[Sarah Clarke]]) and his daughter Maddie ([[Madison Lintz]]) for Christmas, but also wants Eleanor's skills as a former FBI profiler to get her opinion on Waits. While initially unwilling to help, Eleanor reviews the Waits case and concludes the name Raynard Waits comes from a French fairy tale and the items stolen from the hardware store were for a lair. Irving informs DA O'Shea he has the video of the Waits field trip and makes a tentative alliance to assure O'Shea becomes mayor and Irving becomes Chief. While in Las Vegas, Bosch is informed of a potential lead in the Delacroix case involving Johnny Stokes ([[Shawn Hatosy]]), and Bosch immediately returns to Los Angeles. While pursuing Stokes, Officer Brasher is shot in the ribs (although protected by her bullet-resistant vest) and she claims Stokes did it in a struggle. Bosch is certain he saw Brasher accidentally shoot herself, which if true would be the final mark on her record to fire her.\n |LineColor = EE714F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 7\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 7\n |Title = Chapter Seven: Lost Boys\n |DirectedBy = [[Alex Zakrzewski]]\n |WrittenBy = Joe Gonzalez & Eric Overmyer\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|2|13}}\n |ShortSummary = Bosch interviews Stokes about Delacroix, but only comes away more convinced that Stokes didn't shoot Brasher. Visiting Lieutenant Billets at her home for advice on Brasher's shooting leaves Bosch convinced he has to tell the truth no matter the consequences. Bosch revisits Brasher to tell her he knows the truth about the shooting, and Brasher calls Bosch a hypocrite. Bosch has Stokes released to spare the LAPD potential embarrassment. Waits attempts to pick up a man on the highway only to fail to kill him, which leads DC Irving to assign Bosch to find Waits independent of Captain Pounds' task force. Bosch searches Waits' last known address and finds evidence of Waits' obsession with old Parisian catacombs and skulls, which leads Eleanor to speculate that Waits may be building an underground monument of his own. After Edgar reviews footage of a conversation with Waits, Bosch realizes he and Waits were both in the same orphanage giving Bosch his first lead on Waits' real identity. Waits murders his sick mother, telling her that he loves her.\n |LineColor = EE714F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 8\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 8\n |Title = Chapter Eight: High Low\n |DirectedBy = [[Matt Earl Beesley]]\n |WrittenBy = William N.

Captain Pounds informs Brasher her statement about Stokes is a lie and implies he'll back her if she reports Bosch for sexual harassment. DC Irving approaches a powerful voice in the African-American community, Reverend Ott ([[Peter Macon]]), about backing Rick O'Shea for mayor in return for Irving becoming Chief and Ott given a seat on the police commission. A county coroner admits to Bosch that Waits called him from jail and tricked him into giving up information about what was in Delacroix's backpack, which eventually led to Waits' escape. Brasher is reassigned to Bosch's precinct to both of their disappointment. A new lead in the Delacroix case suggests Trent really did kill the boy but on further review convinces Bosch that Stokes actually killed Delacroix for his skateboard. A murder of a prostitute is very similar to his own mother's murder, which draws Bosch back into the Waits case.

Bosch and Billets meet for a drink where Billets admits she also is in a compromising relationship with someone under her command. Waits calls Bosch again to tell him it's all coming to an end. Bosch replies that he knows all of the secrets Waits tried to taunt him with. Waits kidnaps a young mother, leaving a note in her child's stroller in order to taunt Bosch. Bosch calls Eleanor for help, and she tells Bosch the mother is bait for him. Using the files from the orphanage Bosch and Edgar track down Waits to a shed. While Edgar calls for backup, Bosch finds a secret tunnel where Waits has his hostage. After a heated exchange of words Waits throws his hostage aside and aims a gun at Bosch, which forces Bosch to kill him. In the aftermath, Captain Pounds orders his subordinates to tell the media Pounds' task force found Waits. Bosch calls Eleanor to tell her what happened and to ask about Maddie.

Arthur Delacroix's remains are buried leading Sheila to express her anger that Bosch knows what happened to her. DA O'Shea opens a grand jury hearing against the LAPD to ensure Irving's blackmail video of the Waits escape is neutralized. Eleanor calls Bosch to tell him Maddie has run away to LA. Bosch finds Maddie at the bus station and chastises her but is also happy for a chance to spend time with her. Edgar continues to look into Stokes and finds him working as muscle for a slumlord. Leaving Maddie with a colleague, Bosch joins Edgar to chase Stokes. After being caught, Stokes claims Delacroix's death was an accident despite the coroner's report. Bosch returns to Maddie and when she asks, he explains his past to her and she begins to understand him. Stokes is released since he was a juvenile when he killed Delacroix. Captain Pounds approaches Bosch to shame him for not jailing Stokes, but Bosch warns Pounds to leave him alone. Pounds grabs Bosch's arm and Bosch shoves Pounds through a window in front of Mank. Pounds screams that Bosch will regret that incident but Bosch walks away, happy enough that he'll now spend time with his daughter. Bosch turns in his gun and badge to Billets and goes home, only to be called later by Edgar. Sam Delacroix has murdered Stokes. Bosch approaches Sam and asks him if he felt absolved for all he had done but Billets stops Bosch from possible issues in the future.\n |LineColor = EE714F\n}}\n}}\n\n===Season 2 (2016)===\n{{Episode table |background=#221F54 |overall=5 |season=5 |title= |director= |writer= |airdate= |released=y|episodes=\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 11\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 1\n |Title = Trunk Music\n |DirectedBy = [[Alex Zakrzewski]]\n |WrittenBy = [[Eric Overmyer]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|3|11}}\n |ShortSummary = Bosch has been suspended for six months following his incident with Captain Pounds. During that time Bosch was able to grow closer to his daughter Maddie but is largely unchanged.  O'Shea, Irving, and Reverend Ott continue to plan O'Shea's run for mayor and O'Shea's grand jury continues to work under the assumption that Bosch is to blame for the Raynard Waits fiasco. Billets assigns Bosch to a case of a dead body in a car trunk. The body is identified as Anthony Allen ([[Ludwig Manukian]]), a pornographer recently returned from Las Vegas. Chief Irving lies to his wife Connie ([[Erika Alexander]]) about their son, George Irving ([[Robbie Jones (actor)|Robbie Jones]]), telling her George is working a desk job when he is actually working undercover for Internal Affairs investigating Narcotics Detective Eddie Arceneaux ([[James Ransone]]). Bosch and Edgar go to inform Veronica Allen ([[Jeri Ryan]]) and find Carl Nash ([[Brent Sexton]]), a former LAPD detective who resigned after an IA investigation, is running security at the Allen's gated community. Veronica informs Bosch and Edgar that Tony had a string of girlfriends but has no clue why Tony was dead. Billets' search of Tony's car reveals a secret compartment with over two hundred thousand dollars in cash. Bosch and Edgar search Tony's office and find a hidden camera.

Attempts to get information about Allen's death are blocked by Special Agent Griffin ([[John Marshall Jones]]) who only tells them Allen was a minor player in a \"National Security\" case. George Irving continues working with Arceneaux who is careful to not show any of his shakedowns on camera. Bosch receives a call from a reporter who tells him a woman has contacted her about the murder of Bosch's mother. Bosch dismisses the claims as someone just wanting attention. Edgar finds paperwork showing Tony Allen changed his name and was previously a member of an Armenian street gang which has evolved into a criminal empire. Bosch and Billets meet for a drink where Billets reveals her own relationship has ended. Mayor Ramos ([[Yancey Arias]]) meets with Irving to warn him that the Mayor's office knows what Irving, O'Shea, and Ott are planning and asks Irving to support Ramos instead. Irving tells Ramos that he'll pray on it. Edgar deduces Allen was a money launderer for his former Armenian gang. Bosch approaches Veronica Allen who says she suspected the money laundering but since she didn't speak Armenian she didn't know anything else.

Deputy Chief Irving advises his son George that having fear about his assignment would not be a bad thing. In a later meeting with his handler, George states doubts that Arceneaux is part of a larger group but his handler disagrees. Edgar finds people who knew Veronica and they all say she's manipulative. Bosch is partnered in Las Vegas with Detective Iverson who tells him Allen could have been working for Joey Marks ([[Tom Mardirosian]]), an Armenian gangster that the LVPD wants to take down. Bosch takes time to see Maddie who informs him that Eleanor's current husband may have left her and Eleanor is starting to become unhinged. That night Bosch goes to Allen's favorite strip club in an attempt to locate Layla, Allen's current girlfriend, but draws the attention of the club's manager Luke Rykov ([[Matthew Lillard]]). Rykov denies he works for Marks, knows Layla, or knows anything about Allen's death but after he has Bosch thrown out he calls someone and speaks in Armenian.

Irving asks Bosch to help him run a separate investigation knowing Bosch would do anything to catch a cop killer. Eleanor gives Agent Griffin the information from Bosch. While skeptical of her motives, Griffin agrees to uphold his end of the agreement. Bosch and Irving force Arceneaux to talk to them by telling him the stash house his crew hit was connected to a major cartel.

Authorized officials may recommend evacuation or medical treatment of exposed persons in nearby areas.\n*'''Radiological Hazard Warning''' (RHW) \u2013 Indicates the loss, discovery, theft or release of a radiological hazard.\n*'''Shelter in Place Warning''' (SPW) \u2013 Indicates an event (such as the release of hazardous materials containing toxic fumes or radioactivity harmful to residents in the warning area) in which the public is recommended to shelter in place and take necessary safety precautions.\n*'''Tsunami Watch''' (TSA) \u2013 A tsunami is forecast to impact the specified area.\n*'''Tsunami Warning''' (TSW) \u2013 A tsunami with the potential of causing widespread coastal flooding accompanied by powerful currents and inundation and/or significant damage to adjacent property is imminent, expected or occurring and may continue for several hours after the wave's initial arrival.\n*'''Tsunami Advisory''' \u2013 A tsunami with the potential to generate strong currents or waves dangerous to those in or very near the water is imminent, expected, or occurring. The threat may continue for several hours after initial arrival, but significant inundation of land and adjacent property is not expected.\n*'''[[Volcano warning schemes of the United States|Volcano Warning]]''' (VOW) \u2013 Indicates volcanic activity that is ongoing or imminent.\n\n==Wind and tropical cyclones==\nWind alerting is classified into groups of two Beaufort numbers, beginning at 6\u20137 for the lowest class of wind advisories. The last group includes three Beaufort numbers, 14\u201316. The actual alerts can be categorized into three classes: maritime wind warnings, land wind warnings, and [[tropical storm watch|tropical cyclone warnings]]. Advisory-force and gale-force winds will not trigger a separate wind advisory or warning if a [[Blizzard warning]] is already in effect. However, as seen with [[Hurricane Sandy]], if widespread high wind warnings are in effect prior to the issuance of a blizzard warning, the high wind warnings may be continued.\n\n===Wind alert terms and signals===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| '''Wind speed''' || '''Marine or Beach Hazard Warning''' || '''Land Warning''' || '''Tropical Cyclone Warning(s)''' || '''Flags''' || '''Lights''' || '''Beaufort force'''\n|-\n| 25 to 38&nbsp;mph (22 to 33 knots) || [[Small craft advisory]]<ref>{{cite web|title=National Weather Service glossary: Small Craft Advisory|url=https://forecast-v3.weather.gov/glossary?search=Small+Craft+Advisory|website=National Weather Service|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=June 25, 2009|access-date=October 25, 2009}}</ref> || [[Wind Advisory]] || Wind Advisory or Small craft advisory || [[File:Small craft warning (USA).jpg]] || [[File:smallcraftlights.gif]] || 6\u20137\n|-\n| 39 to 54&nbsp;mph (34 to 47 knots) || [[Gale warning]]<ref>{{cite web|title=National Weather Service glossary: Gale Warning|url=https://forecast-v3.weather.gov/glossary?search=Gale+Warning|website=National Weather Service|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=June 25, 2009| access-date=October 25, 2009}}</ref> || [[High wind warning]] || [[Tropical cyclone warnings and watches#Tropical Storm Warning|Tropical storm warning]]* || [[File:Gale warning (USA).jpg]] || [[File:galelights.gif]] || 8\u20139\n|-\n| 55 to 73&nbsp;mph (48 to 63 knots) || [[Storm warning]]<ref>{{cite web|title=National Weather Service glossary: Storm Warning|url=https://forecast-v3.weather.gov/glossary?search=Storm+Warning|website=National Weather Service|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=June 25, 2009| access-date=October 25, 2009}}</ref> || High wind warning || Tropical storm warning\u2020 || [[File:Storm warning (USA).jpg]] || [[File:stormlights.gif]] || 10\u201311\n|-\n| 74\u2013110&nbsp;mph (64 to 99 knots) || [[Hurricane force wind warning|Hurricane Force Wind Warning]]<ref>{{cite web|website=National Weather Service|date=June 25, 2009|access-date=October 25, 2009|title=National Weather Service glossary: Hurricane Force Wind Warning|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration| url=https://forecast-v3.weather.gov/glossary?search=Hurricane+Force+Wind+Warning}}</ref> || High wind warning || [[Tropical cyclone warnings and watches#Hurricane Warning|Hurricane warning]] || [[File:Hurricane warning (USA).jpg]] || [[File:hurricanelights.gif]] || 12\u201313\n|-\n| Over 110&nbsp;mph (100+ knots) || Hurricane Force Wind Warning || [[Extreme wind warning]] || Hurricane warning and [[Extreme wind warning]]\u2021 || none || none || 14\u201316\n|-\n|}\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> {{small|Tropical Storm Warning flags and lights will always be displayed the same as Storm Warning flags and lights.}}<br>\n\u2020 {{small|A tropical storm with winds in this range is sometimes referred to as a \"severe tropical storm\".}}<br>\n\u2021 {{small|The Extreme Wind Warning is issued shortly before the [[eyewall]] makes landfall}}\n\n==Hazardous weather risks==\nThe various weather conditions described above have different levels of risk. The National Weather Service uses a multi-tier system of weather statements to notify the public of threatening weather conditions. These statements are used in conjunction with specific weather phenomena to convey different levels of risk. In order of increasing risk, these statements are:\n*'''Outlook''' \u2013 A Hazardous Weather Outlook is issued daily to indicate that a hazardous weather or hydrologic event may occur in the next seven days. Each segment of the product will contain sections outlining hazardous weather in the short term (through Day 1) and long term (for Days 2-7), and spotter information. The outlook will include information about potential severe thunderstorms, heavy rain or flooding, winter weather, extremes of heat or cold, etc., that may develop over the next seven days with an emphasis on the first 24 hours of the forecast. It is intended to provide information to those who need considerable lead time to prepare for the event (such as [[emergency management]] agencies, Skywarn spotters and media outlets). If issued for a coastal area, the outlook will contain two segments: one for the marine zones and adjacent land-based (i.e., coastal) zones, and the other for the remainder of the land-based zones.<ref>{{cite web|title=National Weather Service glossary: Outlook|url=https://forecast-v3.weather.gov/glossary?search=Outlook|website=National Weather Service|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=June 25, 2009|access-date=October 25, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Weather Watch, Warning and Advisory Criteria|url=https://www.weather.gov/lwx/WarningsDefined|website=[[National Weather Service Baltimore/Washington|National Weather Service Weather Forecast Office Baltimore/Washington]]|access-date=January 7, 2020}}</ref>\n*'''Advisory''' \u2013 An advisory is issued when a hazardous weather or hydrologic event is occurring, imminent, or likely. Advisories are for \"less serious\" conditions than warnings that may cause significant inconvenience, and if caution is not exercised could lead to situations that may threaten life or property. The National Weather Service may activate weather spotters in areas affected by advisories to help them better track and analyze the event.<ref>{{cite web|title=National Weather Service glossary: Advisory|url=https://forecast-v3.weather.gov/glossary?search=Advisory|website=National Weather Service|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=June 25, 2009|access-date=October 25, 2009}}</ref>\n*'''Emergency''' \u2013 An Emergency is issued when an event that by itself cannot pose a threat to life or property, but may indirectly cause other events to happen that may pose a threat to life or property. An example of this would be a [[power outage]], which although not directly posing a hazard, may threaten public safety and critical services. The only existing exceptions to this are the '''[[tornado emergency]]''' and '''[[flash flood emergency]]''', which are issued to get the attention of the public to a major tornado or flash flood.<ref name=\"nws.noaa.gov\">{{cite web|title=Emergency Alert System (EAS) Event Codes/NWR Specific Area Message Encoding (NWR-SAME) Codes|url=http://www.nws.noaa.gov/os/eas_codes.shtml|website=National Weather Service|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=October 11, 2005|access-date=August 13, 2012}}</ref>\n*'''Watch''' \u2013 A watch is used when the risk of a hazardous weather or hydrologic event has increased significantly, but its occurrence, location, or timing is still uncertain. It is intended to provide enough lead time so those who need to set their plans in motion can do so. A watch means that hazardous weather is possible. People should have a plan of action in case a storm threatens and they should listen for later information and possible warnings especially when planning travel or outdoor activities. The National Weather Service may activate weather spotters in areas affected by watches to help them better track and analyze the event.<ref>{{cite web|title=National Weather Service glossary: Watch|url=https://forecast-v3.weather.gov/glossary?search=Watch|website=National Weather Service|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=June 25, 2009|access-date=October 25, 2009}}</ref>\n*'''Warning''' \u2013 A warning is issued when a hazardous weather or hydrologic event is occurring, imminent, or likely. A warning means weather conditions pose a threat to life or property. People in the path of the storm need to take protective action.

Several common scales are described below.\n\n===Hail diameter sizes===\n{{main|Hail}}\nThe size of individual hailstones that reach surface level is determined by speed of the updraft which create the individual ice crystals at atmospheric levels. Larger hailstones are capable of producing damage to property, and particularly with very large hailstones, resulting in serious injury or death due to blunt-force trauma induced by the impact of the hailstones. Hailstone size is typically correspondent to the size of an object for comparative purposes.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| '''Hailstone size''' || '''Measurement ([[inch|in]])''' || '''Measurement ([[centimeter|cm]])''' || '''Updraft Speed (mph)''' || '''Updraft Speed (m/s)'''\n|-\n| [[pea]] || 0.25 || 0.6 || 40 || 18\n|-\n| [[penny (United States coin)|penny]] || 0.75 || 1.9 || 44 || 20\n|-\n| [[quarter (United States coin)|quarter]]* || 1.00 || 2.5 || 49 || 22\n|-\n| [[half dollar (United States coin)|half dollar]] || 1.25 || 3.2 || 54 || 24\n|-\n| [[walnut]] || 1.50 || 3.8 || 60 || 27\n|-\n| [[golf ball]] || 1.75 || 4.4 || 64 || 29\n|-\n| hen egg\u2020 || 2.00 || 5.1 || 69 || 31\n|-\n| [[tennis ball]] || 2.50 || 6.4 || 77 || 34\n|-\n| [[Baseball (ball)|baseball]] || 2.75 || 7.0 || 81 || 36\n|-\n| [[teacup|tea cup]] || 3 || 7.6 || 84 || 38\n|-\n| [[grapefruit]] || 4 || 10.1 || 98 || 44\n|-\n| [[softball]] || 4.50 || 11.4 || 103 || 46\n|-\n|}\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> <small>Begins hail sizes within the severe hail criterion.</small><br>\n\u2020 <small>Begins hail sizes within the [[Storm Prediction Center]]'s significant severe criterion.</small>\n\n===Beaufort wind scale===\n{{main|Beaufort scale}}\nThe '''Beaufort scale''' is an empirical measure that correlates wind speed to observed conditions at sea or on land.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| '''Wind category''' || '''Beaufort number''' || '''Wind speed''' || '''Conditions'''\n|-\n| [[Wind advisory|Advisory]]-force || 6 || 25\u201331&nbsp;mph<br/>(40\u201350&nbsp;km/h) || Large branches in motion; whistling in [[telephone]] wires.\n|-\n| Advisory-force || 7 || 32\u201338&nbsp;mph<br/>(51\u201362&nbsp;km/h) || Whole trees in motion; inconvenience felt walking against wind.\n|-\n| [[Gale]]-force || 8\u20139 || 39\u201354&nbsp;mph<br/>(63\u201388&nbsp;km/h) || Twigs break off trees; wind generally impedes progress.

EF0 and EF1 tornadoes are considered \"weak\" tornadoes, EF2 and EF3 are classified as \"strong\" tornadoes, with winds of at least major hurricane force, where EF4 and EF5 are categorized as \"violent\" tornadoes, with winds corresponding to category 5 hurricane winds and rising to match or exceed the strongest tropical cyclones on record. The EF scale is based on tornado damage (primarily to buildings), which makes it difficult to rate tornadoes that strike in sparsely populated areas, where few man-made structures are found. The Enhanced Fujita scale went into effect on February 1, 2007.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| EF number || Wind speed || Comparable hurricane winds || Damage || Examples \n|-\n| 0 || 65\u201385&nbsp;mph (105\u2013137&nbsp;km/h) || Severe tropical storm \u2013 Category 1 || Light damage.

The scale spans from Category 1 (winds of at least {{convert|74|mph|km/h}}) to Category 5 (exceeding {{convert|156|mph|km/h}}). Unlike the Enhanced Fujita Scale, which assigns ratings for tornadoes after damage has been incurred and thoroughly assessed, categories on the Saffir-Simpson scale are assigned to most active cyclones that reach the minimum hurricane threshold, even before landfall.\n\n<!--\nPLEASE NOTE: Intensity of example hurricanes is at time of landfall AND peak intensity. Choose your examples carefully to avoid confusion.\n\nFor instance: DO NOT ADD HURRICANE KATRINA AS AN EXAMPLE.\nKatrina is not a good example of either a Cat 3, Cat 4, or a Cat 5 since \"officially\" it was a Cat 3, it was operationally a Cat 4,\nbut in pressure, surge, and damage most people will think of it as a Cat 5, which will be confusing for the reader.\n\nDon't add any other storms with disputed categories (i.e. Ivan, Frederic).\n\nAlso, don't add linebreaks below this comment markup.\n\n-->{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right;\"\n|-\n!

Severe Thunderstorm Warnings may be issued in combination with a Special Marine Warning if the storm affects nearshore or coastal waters.<ref name=\"nws-svrrsrcs\"/><ref>{{cite web|title=National Weather Service glossary: Severe thunderstorm warning|url=https://forecast-v3.weather.gov/glossary?search=Severe+Thunderstorm+Warning|website=National Weather Service|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=June 25, 2009|access-date=October 25, 2009}}</ref>\n*:'''Particularly Dangerous Situation Severe Thunderstorm Warning''' (SVR) \u2013 Issued within the initial severe thunderstorm warning or as a complete re-issuance of the previously issued warning, a PDS Severe Thunderstorm Warning indicates a significant severe thunderstorm has been detected by Doppler weather radar and/or observed by Skywarn spotters or other civil defense personnel, and is moving into and through the warned area with the capability of causing significant property damage, and severe injury or fatality to people or animals caught in the storm's path. These may be issued for an ongoing severe wind event (either by a derecho, or from an intense wind core or downburst within a squall line or supercell) containing winds greater than 80&nbsp;mph (124&nbsp;km/h or 70 [[knot (unit)|knot]]s), and/or extreme hail of {{convert|3|in|mm}} diameter or larger over a wide area.\n*:'''Severe Thunderstorm Emergency''' (SVS) \u2013 Sent as a \"severe weather statement\" or a complete re-issuance of the severe thunderstorm warning, this is an unofficial, high-end severe thunderstorm warning that is occasionally issued when a significant severe thunderstorm is imminent or impacting a highly populated area.

A flash flood is a flood that occurs within six hours of excessive rainfall and poses a threat to life and/or property, especially in low-lying or flood prone areas (including urban areas with poor drainage, rivers and streams); ice jams and dam failures can also cause flash floods. These warnings are issued on a county by county (or equivalent thereof) basis by the local Weather Forecast Office and are generally in effect for two to six hours, although particularly during tropical cyclones a warning may last for a longer period of time, and occasionally last shorter than two hours.<ref name=\"nws-wtrrsrcs\">{{cite web|title=NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE INSTRUCTION 10-922: WEATHER FORECAST OFFICE WATER RESOURCES PRODUCTS SPECIFICATION|url=https://www.nws.noaa.gov/directives/sym/pd01009022curr.pdf|website=National Weather Service Analyze, Forecast, and Support Office|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=December 6, 2019|access-date=January 7, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=National Weather Service glossary: Flash Flood Warning|url=https://forecast-v3.weather.gov/glossary?search=Flash+Flood+Warning|website=National Weather Service|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=June 25, 2009|access-date=October 25, 2009}}</ref>\n*:'''Particularly Dangerous Situation Flash Flood Warning''' (FFW) \u2013 Issued within the initial flash flood warning or as a complete re-issuance of the previously issued warning, this indicates widespread, life-threatening flash flooding\u2014caused by excessive rainfall, ice jams or imminent dam failures\u2014has been indicated by Doppler weather radar, emergency personnel or trained observers over a broadly populated area.\n*:'''Flash Flood Emergency''' (FFS) \u2013 A flash flood emergency is a high-end usage of the flash flood warning product.

The National Weather Service uses a multi-tier system of weather statements to notify the public of threatening weather conditions. These statements are used in conjunction with specific weather phenomena to convey different levels of risk. In order of increasing risk, these statements are:\n*'''Outlook''' \u2013 A Hazardous Weather Outlook is issued daily to indicate that a hazardous weather or hydrologic event may occur in the next seven days. Each segment of the product will contain sections outlining hazardous weather in the short term (through Day 1) and long term (for Days 2-7), and spotter information. The outlook will include information about potential severe thunderstorms, heavy rain or flooding, winter weather, extremes of heat or cold, etc., that may develop over the next seven days with an emphasis on the first 24 hours of the forecast. It is intended to provide information to those who need considerable lead time to prepare for the event (such as [[emergency management]] agencies, Skywarn spotters and media outlets). If issued for a coastal area, the outlook will contain two segments: one for the marine zones and adjacent land-based (i.e., coastal) zones, and the other for the remainder of the land-based zones.<ref>{{cite web|title=National Weather Service glossary: Outlook|url=https://forecast-v3.weather.gov/glossary?search=Outlook|website=National Weather Service|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=June 25, 2009|access-date=October 25, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Weather Watch, Warning and Advisory Criteria|url=https://www.weather.gov/lwx/WarningsDefined|website=[[National Weather Service Baltimore/Washington|National Weather Service Weather Forecast Office Baltimore/Washington]]|access-date=January 7, 2020}}</ref>\n*'''Advisory''' \u2013 An advisory is issued when a hazardous weather or hydrologic event is occurring, imminent, or likely.

The National Weather Service may activate weather spotters in areas affected by advisories to help them better track and analyze the event.<ref>{{cite web|title=National Weather Service glossary: Advisory|url=https://forecast-v3.weather.gov/glossary?search=Advisory|website=National Weather Service|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=June 25, 2009|access-date=October 25, 2009}}</ref>\n*'''Emergency''' \u2013 An Emergency is issued when an event that by itself cannot pose a threat to life or property, but may indirectly cause other events to happen that may pose a threat to life or property. An example of this would be a [[power outage]], which although not directly posing a hazard, may threaten public safety and critical services.

It is intended to provide enough lead time so those who need to set their plans in motion can do so. A watch means that hazardous weather is possible. People should have a plan of action in case a storm threatens and they should listen for later information and possible warnings especially when planning travel or outdoor activities.

Several common scales are described below.\n\n===Hail diameter sizes===\n{{main|Hail}}\nThe size of individual hailstones that reach surface level is determined by speed of the updraft which create the individual ice crystals at atmospheric levels. Larger hailstones are capable of producing damage to property, and particularly with very large hailstones, resulting in serious injury or death due to blunt-force trauma induced by the impact of the hailstones. Hailstone size is typically correspondent to the size of an object for comparative purposes.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| '''Hailstone size''' || '''Measurement ([[inch|in]])''' || '''Measurement ([[centimeter|cm]])''' || '''Updraft Speed (mph)''' || '''Updraft Speed (m/s)'''\n|-\n| [[pea]] || 0.25 || 0.6 || 40 || 18\n|-\n| [[penny (United States coin)|penny]] || 0.75 || 1.9 || 44 || 20\n|-\n| [[quarter (United States coin)|quarter]]* || 1.00 || 2.5 || 49 || 22\n|-\n| [[half dollar (United States coin)|half dollar]] || 1.25 || 3.2 || 54 || 24\n|-\n| [[walnut]] || 1.50 || 3.8 || 60 || 27\n|-\n| [[golf ball]] || 1.75 || 4.4 || 64 || 29\n|-\n| hen egg\u2020 || 2.00 || 5.1 || 69 || 31\n|-\n| [[tennis ball]] || 2.50 || 6.4 || 77 || 34\n|-\n| [[Baseball (ball)|baseball]] || 2.75 || 7.0 || 81 || 36\n|-\n| [[teacup|tea cup]] || 3 || 7.6 || 84 || 38\n|-\n| [[grapefruit]] || 4 || 10.1 || 98 || 44\n|-\n| [[softball]] || 4.50 || 11.4 || 103 || 46\n|-\n|}\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> <small>Begins hail sizes within the severe hail criterion.</small><br>\n\u2020 <small>Begins hail sizes within the [[Storm Prediction Center]]'s significant severe criterion.</small>\n\n===Beaufort wind scale===\n{{main|Beaufort scale}}\nThe '''Beaufort scale''' is an empirical measure that correlates wind speed to observed conditions at sea or on land.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| '''Wind category''' || '''Beaufort number''' || '''Wind speed''' || '''Conditions'''\n|-\n| [[Wind advisory|Advisory]]-force || 6 || 25\u201331&nbsp;mph<br/>(40\u201350&nbsp;km/h) || Large branches in motion; whistling in [[telephone]] wires.\n|-\n| Advisory-force || 7 || 32\u201338&nbsp;mph<br/>(51\u201362&nbsp;km/h) || Whole trees in motion; inconvenience felt walking against wind.\n|-\n| [[Gale]]-force || 8\u20139 || 39\u201354&nbsp;mph<br/>(63\u201388&nbsp;km/h) || Twigs break off trees; wind generally impedes progress.

EF0 and EF1 tornadoes are considered \"weak\" tornadoes, EF2 and EF3 are classified as \"strong\" tornadoes, with winds of at least major hurricane force, where EF4 and EF5 are categorized as \"violent\" tornadoes, with winds corresponding to category 5 hurricane winds and rising to match or exceed the strongest tropical cyclones on record. The EF scale is based on tornado damage (primarily to buildings), which makes it difficult to rate tornadoes that strike in sparsely populated areas, where few man-made structures are found. The Enhanced Fujita scale went into effect on February 1, 2007.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| EF number || Wind speed || Comparable hurricane winds || Damage || Examples \n|-\n| 0 || 65\u201385&nbsp;mph (105\u2013137&nbsp;km/h) || Severe tropical storm \u2013 Category 1 || Light damage.

The scale spans from Category 1 (winds of at least {{convert|74|mph|km/h}}) to Category 5 (exceeding {{convert|156|mph|km/h}}). Unlike the Enhanced Fujita Scale, which assigns ratings for tornadoes after damage has been incurred and thoroughly assessed, categories on the Saffir-Simpson scale are assigned to most active cyclones that reach the minimum hurricane threshold, even before landfall.\n\n<!--\nPLEASE NOTE: Intensity of example hurricanes is at time of landfall AND peak intensity. Choose your examples carefully to avoid confusion.\n\nFor instance: DO NOT ADD HURRICANE KATRINA AS AN EXAMPLE.\nKatrina is not a good example of either a Cat 3, Cat 4, or a Cat 5 since \"officially\" it was a Cat 3, it was operationally a Cat 4,\nbut in pressure, surge, and damage most people will think of it as a Cat 5, which will be confusing for the reader.\n\nDon't add any other storms with disputed categories (i.e. Ivan, Frederic).\n\nAlso, don't add linebreaks below this comment markup.\n\n-->{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right;\"\n|-\n!
