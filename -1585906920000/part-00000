Dicey]].  He was educated at [[Eton College]], and for two years at [[King's College, London]]. In October 1847 he entered [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].<ref>{{acad|id=STFN846JF|name=Stephen, James Fitzjames}}</ref> Although an outstanding student he did not win any prizes, mainly because he was uninterested in mathematics or classics, which formed the basis of the course. He was called to the Bar. Being conscious of the slightness of his legal education, he then read for an LL.B. from the University of London.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Heydon|first=John|date=2010|title=Reflections on James Fitzjames Stephen|url=http://classic.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/UQLawJl/2010/5.pdf|journal=University of Queensland Law Journal|volume=|pages=24|via=Austlii}}</ref> He was already acquainted with [[Henry James Sumner Maine|Sir Henry Maine]], six years his senior, and then newly appointed to the [[Regius Professor of Civil Law (Cambridge)|Chair of Civil Law]] at Cambridge. Although their temperaments were very different, their acquaintance became a strong friendship, which ended only with Maine's death in 1888.\n\nStephen was introduced by Maine into the Cambridge society known as [[Cambridge Apostles]], forming friendships with some of its members.  The society contained a remarkable group of men who afterwards became eminent in different ways: for example, developer of classical electromagnetic theory [[James Clerk Maxwell]] and Liberal Party leader Sir [[William Vernon Harcourt (politician)|William Harcourt]].\n\n==Career==\n\n[[File:Sir James Fitzjames Stephen.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Sir James Fitzjames Stephen, by [[George Frederic Watts]], 1886.]]\nStephen chose a legal career, which was on balance a notable one: He was a member of the Viceregal Council and later Professor of Common Law at the [[Inns of Court]].  He was largely occupied with official work on [[Codification (law)|codification]], some of which were introduced as bills in the Westminster Parliament, though none of his codes ultimately became law in England. He was, however, responsible for the [[Indian Evidence Act|Indian Evidence Act, 1872]].  In 1879 he became a judge of the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]].\n\n===Early career===\n\nAfter leaving Cambridge, Stephen decided to go into law. He was [[called to the bar]] in 1854 by the [[Inner Temple]].<ref name=\"ODNB\" /> His own estimation of his professional success\u2014written in later years\u2014was that in spite of such training rather than because of it, he became a moderately successful [[advocate]] and a rather distinguished judge.\n\nIn his earlier years at the bar he supplemented his income from a successful but modest practice with journalism.  He contributed to the ''[[Saturday Review (London)|Saturday Review]]'' from the time it was founded in 1855. He was in company with Maine, Harcourt, [[George Stovin Venables|G.S. Venables]], Charles Bowen, [[Edward Augustus Freeman|E.A. Freeman]], [[Goldwin Smith]] and others. Both the first and the last books published by Stephen were selections from his papers in the ''Saturday Review'' (''Essays by a Barrister'', 1862, anonymous; ''Horae sabbaticae'', 1892). These volumes embodied the results of his studies of publicists and [[theologians]], chiefly English, from the 17th century onwards. He never professed his essays to be more than the occasional products of an amateur's leisure, but they were well received.\n\nFrom 1858 to 1861, Stephen served as secretary to a [[Royal Commission]] on popular [[education]], whose conclusions were promptly put into effect. In 1859 he was appointed Recorder of [[Newark-on-Trent|Newark]]. In 1863 he published his ''General View of the Criminal Law of England'',<ref>The second edition of 1890 was practically a new book.</ref> the first attempt made since [[William Blackstone]] to explain the principles of [[English law]] and justice in a literary form, and it enjoyed considerable success. The foundation of the ''[[Pall Mall Gazette]]'' in 1865 gave Stephen a new literary avenue. He continued to contribute until he became a judge.\n\n===As civil servant===\n\n[[File:James F. Stephen.jpg|thumb|180px|Sir James Fitzjames Stephen, ca. 1870's.]]\nThe decisive point of his career was in the summer of 1869, when he accepted the post of legal member of the [[Imperial Legislative Council]]. His friend Maine was his immediate predecessor: Guided by Maine's comprehensive talents, the government of India had entered a period of systematic legislation which was to last about twenty years. Stephen had the task of continuing this work by conducting the Bills through the Legislative Council. The [[Christian Law of Marriage in India|Native Marriages Act]] of 1872 was the result of deep consideration on both Maine's and Stephen's part. The [[Indian Contract Act 1872|Indian Contract Act]] had been framed in England by a learned commission, and the draft was materially altered in Stephen's hands before, also in 1872, it became law.\n\n====Indian Evidence Act====\n\nThe [[Indian Evidence Act]] of the same year, entirely Stephen's own work, made the rules of evidence uniform for all residents of India, regardless of caste, social position, or religion. Besides drafting legislation, at this time Stephen had to attend to the current administrative business of his department, and he took a full share in the general deliberations of the viceroy's council. His last official act in India was the publication of a minute on the administration of justice which pointed the way to reforms not yet fully realized, and is still a valuable tool for anyone wishing to understand the judicial system of [[British India]].\n\n===Return to England===\n\nStephen, mainly for family reasons, came home in the spring of 1872. During the voyage he wrote a series of articles which resulted in his book ''Liberty, Equality, Fraternity'' (1873\u20131874)--a protest against [[John Stuart Mill]]'s neo-[[utilitarianism]]. Most famously he attacked the thesis of J S Mill's essay ''[[On Liberty]]'' and argued for legal compulsion, coercion and restraint in the interests of morality and religion.<ref>{{cite book|last= Stephen|first= James Fitzjames |title= Liberty, Equality, Fraternity |publisher= Holt & Williams |location= New York |year= 1873|chapter= |url=https://archive.org/details/libertyequality01stepgoog |pages=   |accessdate=7 November 2014}}</ref><ref>Kimball, Roger (2005). [http://www.newcriterion.com/posts.cfm/liberty-equality-fraternity-3835 \"Liberty, Equality, Fraternity,\"] ''Arma Virumque, The New Criterion''.</ref>\n\nFitzjames Stephen stood in an [[Dundee by-election, 1873|1873 by-election]] as a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] for [[Dundee (UK Parliament constituency)|Dundee]], but came in last place.\n\nExperience in India gave Stephen opportunity for his next activity. The government of India had been driven by the conditions of the Indian judicial system to recast a considerable part of the English law which had been informally imported. [[Criminal law]] procedure, and a good deal of [[commercial law]], had been or were being put into easily understood language, intelligible to civilian magistrates. The rational substance of the law was preserved, while disorder and excessive technicalities were removed. Using [[Jeremy Bentham]]'s ideal of codification, he attempted to get the same principles put into practice in the United Kingdom. In spite of six years of effort on this task, Stephen was largely unsuccessful in making any reforms. Stephen also privately published digests in code form of the [[law of evidence]] and criminal law.\n\n===Judicial career and legacy===\n\n[[File:James Fitzjames Stephen Vanity Fair 7 March 1885.jpg|thumb|180px|''Judges,'' No. 14, [[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]], March 7, 1885.]]\nStephen was in 1879 appointed a judge of the High Court. He had transient hopes of an Evidence Act being brought before [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]], and in 1878 the Digest of Criminal Law became a Ministerial Bill with the co-operation of [[Sir John Holker]], who was Attorney-General in the second government of [[Benjamin Disraeli]]. The Bill was referred to a judicial commission, which included Stephen, but ultimately failed, and was revised and reintroduced in 1879 and again in 1880.  It dealt with procedure as well as substantive law, and provided for a court of criminal appeal, though after several years of judicial experience Stephen changed his mind as to the wisdom of this course.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} However, no substantial progress was made during any sessions of Parliament. In 1883 the part relating to procedure was brought in separately by [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]]'s law officer [[Henry James, 1st Baron James of Hereford|Sir Henry James]], and went to the grand committee on law, which found that there was insufficient time to deal with it satisfactorily in the course of the session.\n\nCriminal appeal was discussed and an Act passed in 1907; otherwise nothing has been done in the UK with either part of the draft code since. The historical materials which Stephen had long been collecting took permanent shape in 1883 as his ''History of the Criminal Law of England''. He lacked time for a planned ''Digest of the Law of Contract'' (which would have been much fuller than the Indian Code). Thus none of Stephen's own plans of English codification took effect.  The [[Parliament of Canada]] used a version of Stephen's Draft Bill revised and augmented by [[George Burbidge]], at the time Judge of the [[Exchequer Court of Canada]], to codify its criminal law in 1892 as the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|''Criminal Code, 1892]]. New Zealand followed with the ''New Zealand Criminal Code Act 1893'' and a number of Australian colonies adopted their own versions as Criminal Codes in following years.\n\nAn eleven-volume set of his collected writings is currently being prepared for [[Oxford University Press]] by the [[Editorial Institute]] at [[Boston University]].\n\nHis book ''Liberty, Equality, Fraternity'' was called the \"finest exposition of conservative thought in the latter half of the 19th century\" by [[Ernest Barker]].<ref>Ernest Barker, ''Political Thought in England: 1848 to 1914'' (London: Thornton Butterworth, 1915), p. 150.</ref> It was listed as one of Ten Conservative Books to read in the chapter of that name in ''The Politics of Prudence'' by [[Russell Kirk]].\n\nThe 1957 [[Wolfenden report]] recommended the decriminalisation of homosexuality and this sparked off the [[H. L. A. Hart|Hart]]-[[Patrick Devlin, Baron Devlin|Devlin]] debate on the relationship between politics and morals. Lord Devlin's 1959 critique of the Wolfenden report (titled 'The Enforcement of Morals') resembled Stephen's arguments, although Devlin had arrived at his opinions independently, having never read ''Liberty, Equality, Fraternity''.<ref name=\"Heydon\">John Heydon, 'Reflections on James Fitzjames Stephen', ''University of Queensland Law Journal'', 29, no. 1 (2010), p. 49.</ref> Hart claimed that \"though a century divides these two legal writers, the similarity in the general tone and sometimes in the detail of their arguments is very great\".<ref name=\"Heydon\"/><ref name=\"Hart\">H. L. A. Hart, ''Law, Liberty and Morality'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1963), p. 16.</ref> Afterwards, Devlin tried to obtain a copy of ''Liberty, Equality, Fraternity'' from his local library but could only do so with \"great difficulty\"; the copy, when it arrived, was \"held together with an elastic band\".<ref name=\"Heydon\"/><ref>Patrick Devlin, ''The Enforcement of Morals'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1965), p. vii.</ref> Hart, an opponent of Stephen's views, regarded ''Liberty, Equality, Fraternity'' as \"sombre and impressive\".<ref>Heydon, p. 50.</ref><ref name=\"Hart\"/>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:James Fitzjames Stephen, Kensal Green Cemetery.JPG|thumb|Monument, Kensal Green Cemetery]]\nHe married Mary Richenda Cunningham, daughter of [[John William Cunningham]],<ref>{{cite DNB|wstitle=Cunningham, John William}}</ref> on 19 September 1855. Their children included:\n* [[Katharine Stephen]] (1856\u20131924), Principal of [[Newnham College, Cambridge]];\n* Herbert Stephen (1857\u20131932), who succeeded him in the baronetcy;\n* [[James Kenneth Stephen]] (1859-1892), a promising poet who died before his father; \n* [[Harry Lushington Stephen]] (1860\u20131945), appointed to the [[High Court of Calcutta]] in 1901,<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> and became the 3rd baronet on the death of his eldest brother;\n* [[Helen Stephen]] (1862\u20131908);\n* [[Rosamond Stephen]] (1868\u20131951);\n* [[Dorothea Stephen]] (1871\u20131965).\n\n==Death==\nStephen's final years were undermined first by physical and then steady mental decline. Despite accusations of unfairness and bias regarding the murder trials of [[Israel Lipski]] in 1887 and [[Florence Maybrick]] in 1889, Stephen continued performing his judicial duties. However, by early 1891 his declining capacity to exercise judicial functions had become a matter of public discussion and press comment, and following medical advice Stephen resigned in April of that year.<ref name=\"ODNB\">{{ODNBweb|id=26375|first=K. J. M.|last=Smith|title=Stephen, Sir James Fitzjames, first baronet (1829\u20131894)}}</ref> Even during his final days on the bench, Stephen is reported to have been 'brief, terse and to the point, and as lucid as in the old days'. Having lost his intellectual power, however, 'as the hours wore on his voice dropped almost to a whisper'.<ref>''Law Times'' (21 March 1891), p. 370.</ref>\n\nStephen died of chronic renal failure on 11 March 1894 at Red House Park, a nursing home near [[Ipswich]], and was buried at [[Kensal Green Cemetery]], London.<ref name=Paths>{{cite book|title=Paths of Glory|date=1997|publisher=Friends of Kensal Green Cemetery|page=94}}</ref> His wife survived him.\n\n==Quotations==\nOn [[capital punishment]]: \n<blockquote>\u201cSome men, probably, abstain from murder because they fear that, if they committed murder, they would be hung.

Dicey]].  He was educated at [[Eton College]], and for two years at [[King's College, London]]. In October 1847 he entered [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].<ref>{{acad|id=STFN846JF|name=Stephen, James Fitzjames}}</ref> Although an outstanding student he did not win any prizes, mainly because he was uninterested in mathematics or classics, which formed the basis of the course. He was called to the Bar. Being conscious of the slightness of his legal education, he then read for an LL.B. from the University of London.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Heydon|first=John|date=2010|title=Reflections on James Fitzjames Stephen|url=http://classic.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/UQLawJl/2010/5.pdf|journal=University of Queensland Law Journal|volume=|pages=24|via=Austlii}}</ref> He was already acquainted with [[Henry James Sumner Maine|Sir Henry Maine]], six years his senior, and then newly appointed to the [[Regius Professor of Civil Law (Cambridge)|Chair of Civil Law]] at Cambridge. Although their temperaments were very different, their acquaintance became a strong friendship, which ended only with Maine's death in 1888.\n\nStephen was introduced by Maine into the Cambridge society known as [[Cambridge Apostles]], forming friendships with some of its members.  The society contained a remarkable group of men who afterwards became eminent in different ways: for example, developer of classical electromagnetic theory [[James Clerk Maxwell]] and Liberal Party leader Sir [[William Vernon Harcourt (politician)|William Harcourt]].\n\n==Career==\n\n[[File:Sir James Fitzjames Stephen.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Sir James Fitzjames Stephen, by [[George Frederic Watts]], 1886.]]\nStephen chose a legal career, which was on balance a notable one: He was a member of the Viceregal Council and later Professor of Common Law at the [[Inns of Court]].  He was largely occupied with official work on [[Codification (law)|codification]], some of which were introduced as bills in the Westminster Parliament, though none of his codes ultimately became law in England. He was, however, responsible for the [[Indian Evidence Act|Indian Evidence Act, 1872]].  In 1879 he became a judge of the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]].\n\n===Early career===\n\nAfter leaving Cambridge, Stephen decided to go into law. He was [[called to the bar]] in 1854 by the [[Inner Temple]].<ref name=\"ODNB\" /> His own estimation of his professional success\u2014written in later years\u2014was that in spite of such training rather than because of it, he became a moderately successful [[advocate]] and a rather distinguished judge.\n\nIn his earlier years at the bar he supplemented his income from a successful but modest practice with journalism.  He contributed to the ''[[Saturday Review (London)|Saturday Review]]'' from the time it was founded in 1855. He was in company with Maine, Harcourt, [[George Stovin Venables|G.S. Venables]], Charles Bowen, [[Edward Augustus Freeman|E.A. Freeman]], [[Goldwin Smith]] and others. Both the first and the last books published by Stephen were selections from his papers in the ''Saturday Review'' (''Essays by a Barrister'', 1862, anonymous; ''Horae sabbaticae'', 1892). These volumes embodied the results of his studies of publicists and [[theologians]], chiefly English, from the 17th century onwards. He never professed his essays to be more than the occasional products of an amateur's leisure, but they were well received.\n\nFrom 1858 to 1861, Stephen served as secretary to a [[Royal Commission]] on popular [[education]], whose conclusions were promptly put into effect. In 1859 he was appointed Recorder of [[Newark-on-Trent|Newark]]. In 1863 he published his ''General View of the Criminal Law of England'',<ref>The second edition of 1890 was practically a new book.</ref> the first attempt made since [[William Blackstone]] to explain the principles of [[English law]] and justice in a literary form, and it enjoyed considerable success. The foundation of the ''[[Pall Mall Gazette]]'' in 1865 gave Stephen a new literary avenue. He continued to contribute until he became a judge.\n\n===As civil servant===\n\n[[File:James F. Stephen.jpg|thumb|180px|Sir James Fitzjames Stephen, ca. 1870's.]]\nThe decisive point of his career was in the summer of 1869, when he accepted the post of legal member of the [[Imperial Legislative Council]]. His friend Maine was his immediate predecessor: Guided by Maine's comprehensive talents, the government of India had entered a period of systematic legislation which was to last about twenty years. Stephen had the task of continuing this work by conducting the Bills through the Legislative Council. The [[Christian Law of Marriage in India|Native Marriages Act]] of 1872 was the result of deep consideration on both Maine's and Stephen's part. The [[Indian Contract Act 1872|Indian Contract Act]] had been framed in England by a learned commission, and the draft was materially altered in Stephen's hands before, also in 1872, it became law.\n\n====Indian Evidence Act====\n\nThe [[Indian Evidence Act]] of the same year, entirely Stephen's own work, made the rules of evidence uniform for all residents of India, regardless of caste, social position, or religion. Besides drafting legislation, at this time Stephen had to attend to the current administrative business of his department, and he took a full share in the general deliberations of the viceroy's council. His last official act in India was the publication of a minute on the administration of justice which pointed the way to reforms not yet fully realized, and is still a valuable tool for anyone wishing to understand the judicial system of [[British India]].\n\n===Return to England===\n\nStephen, mainly for family reasons, came home in the spring of 1872. During the voyage he wrote a series of articles which resulted in his book ''Liberty, Equality, Fraternity'' (1873\u20131874)--a protest against [[John Stuart Mill]]'s neo-[[utilitarianism]]. Most famously he attacked the thesis of J S Mill's essay ''[[On Liberty]]'' and argued for legal compulsion, coercion and restraint in the interests of morality and religion.<ref>{{cite book|last= Stephen|first= James Fitzjames |title= Liberty, Equality, Fraternity |publisher= Holt & Williams |location= New York |year= 1873|chapter= |url=https://archive.org/details/libertyequality01stepgoog |pages=   |accessdate=7 November 2014}}</ref><ref>Kimball, Roger (2005). [http://www.newcriterion.com/posts.cfm/liberty-equality-fraternity-3835 \"Liberty, Equality, Fraternity,\"] ''Arma Virumque, The New Criterion''.</ref>\n\nFitzjames Stephen stood in an [[Dundee by-election, 1873|1873 by-election]] as a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] for [[Dundee (UK Parliament constituency)|Dundee]], but came in last place.\n\nExperience in India gave Stephen opportunity for his next activity. The government of India had been driven by the conditions of the Indian judicial system to recast a considerable part of the English law which had been informally imported. [[Criminal law]] procedure, and a good deal of [[commercial law]], had been or were being put into easily understood language, intelligible to civilian magistrates. The rational substance of the law was preserved, while disorder and excessive technicalities were removed. Using [[Jeremy Bentham]]'s ideal of codification, he attempted to get the same principles put into practice in the United Kingdom. In spite of six years of effort on this task, Stephen was largely unsuccessful in making any reforms. Stephen also privately published digests in code form of the [[law of evidence]] and criminal law.\n\n===Judicial career and legacy===\n\n[[File:James Fitzjames Stephen Vanity Fair 7 March 1885.jpg|thumb|180px|''Judges,'' No. 14, [[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]], March 7, 1885.]]\nStephen was in 1879 appointed a judge of the High Court. He had transient hopes of an Evidence Act being brought before [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]], and in 1878 the Digest of Criminal Law became a Ministerial Bill with the co-operation of [[Sir John Holker]], who was Attorney-General in the second government of [[Benjamin Disraeli]]. The Bill was referred to a judicial commission, which included Stephen, but ultimately failed, and was revised and reintroduced in 1879 and again in 1880.  It dealt with procedure as well as substantive law, and provided for a court of criminal appeal, though after several years of judicial experience Stephen changed his mind as to the wisdom of this course.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} However, no substantial progress was made during any sessions of Parliament. In 1883 the part relating to procedure was brought in separately by [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]]'s law officer [[Henry James, 1st Baron James of Hereford|Sir Henry James]], and went to the grand committee on law, which found that there was insufficient time to deal with it satisfactorily in the course of the session.\n\nCriminal appeal was discussed and an Act passed in 1907; otherwise nothing has been done in the UK with either part of the draft code since. The historical materials which Stephen had long been collecting took permanent shape in 1883 as his ''History of the Criminal Law of England''. He lacked time for a planned ''Digest of the Law of Contract'' (which would have been much fuller than the Indian Code). Thus none of Stephen's own plans of English codification took effect.  The [[Parliament of Canada]] used a version of Stephen's Draft Bill revised and augmented by [[George Burbidge]], at the time Judge of the [[Exchequer Court of Canada]], to codify its criminal law in 1892 as the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|''Criminal Code, 1892]]. New Zealand followed with the ''New Zealand Criminal Code Act 1893'' and a number of Australian colonies adopted their own versions as Criminal Codes in following years.\n\nAn eleven-volume set of his collected writings is currently being prepared for [[Oxford University Press]] by the [[Editorial Institute]] at [[Boston University]].\n\nHis book ''Liberty, Equality, Fraternity'' was called the \"finest exposition of conservative thought in the latter half of the 19th century\" by [[Ernest Barker]].<ref>Ernest Barker, ''Political Thought in England: 1848 to 1914'' (London: Thornton Butterworth, 1915), p. 150.</ref> It was listed as one of Ten Conservative Books to read in the chapter of that name in ''The Politics of Prudence'' by [[Russell Kirk]].\n\nThe 1957 [[Wolfenden report]] recommended the decriminalisation of homosexuality and this sparked off the [[H. L. A. Hart|Hart]]-[[Patrick Devlin, Baron Devlin|Devlin]] debate on the relationship between politics and morals. Lord Devlin's 1959 critique of the Wolfenden report (titled 'The Enforcement of Morals') resembled Stephen's arguments, although Devlin had arrived at his opinions independently, having never read ''Liberty, Equality, Fraternity''.<ref name=\"Heydon\">John Heydon, 'Reflections on James Fitzjames Stephen', ''University of Queensland Law Journal'', 29, no. 1 (2010), p. 49.</ref> Hart claimed that \"though a century divides these two legal writers, the similarity in the general tone and sometimes in the detail of their arguments is very great\".<ref name=\"Heydon\"/><ref name=\"Hart\">H. L. A. Hart, ''Law, Liberty and Morality'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1963), p. 16.</ref> Afterwards, Devlin tried to obtain a copy of ''Liberty, Equality, Fraternity'' from his local library but could only do so with \"great difficulty\"; the copy, when it arrived, was \"held together with an elastic band\".<ref name=\"Heydon\"/><ref>Patrick Devlin, ''The Enforcement of Morals'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1965), p. vii.</ref> Hart, an opponent of Stephen's views, regarded ''Liberty, Equality, Fraternity'' as \"sombre and impressive\".<ref>Heydon, p. 50.</ref><ref name=\"Hart\"/>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:James Fitzjames Stephen, Kensal Green Cemetery.JPG|thumb|Monument, Kensal Green Cemetery]]\nHe married Mary Richenda Cunningham, daughter of [[John William Cunningham]],<ref>{{cite DNB|wstitle=Cunningham, John William}}</ref> on 19 September 1855. Their children included:\n* [[Katharine Stephen]] (1856\u20131924), Principal of [[Newnham College, Cambridge]];\n* Herbert Stephen (1857\u20131932), who succeeded him in the baronetcy;\n* [[James Kenneth Stephen]] (1859-1892), a promising poet who died before his father; \n* [[Harry Lushington Stephen]] (1860\u20131945), appointed to the [[High Court of Calcutta]] in 1901,<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> and became the 3rd baronet on the death of his eldest brother;\n* [[Helen Stephen]] (1862\u20131908);\n* [[Rosamond Stephen]] (1868\u20131951);\n* [[Dorothea Stephen]] (1871\u20131965).\n\n==Death==\nStephen's final years were undermined first by physical and then steady mental decline. Despite accusations of unfairness and bias regarding the murder trials of [[Israel Lipski]] in 1887 and [[Florence Maybrick]] in 1889, Stephen continued performing his judicial duties. However, by early 1891 his declining capacity to exercise judicial functions had become a matter of public discussion and press comment, and following medical advice Stephen resigned in April of that year.<ref name=\"ODNB\">{{ODNBweb|id=26375|first=K. J. M.|last=Smith|title=Stephen, Sir James Fitzjames, first baronet (1829\u20131894)}}</ref> Even during his final days on the bench, Stephen is reported to have been 'brief, terse and to the point, and as lucid as in the old days'. Having lost his intellectual power, however, 'as the hours wore on his voice dropped almost to a whisper'.<ref>''Law Times'' (21 March 1891), p. 370.</ref>\n\nStephen died of chronic renal failure on 11 March 1894 at Red House Park, a nursing home near [[Ipswich]], and was buried at [[Kensal Green Cemetery]], London.<ref name=Paths>{{cite book|title=Paths of Glory|date=1997|publisher=Friends of Kensal Green Cemetery|page=94}}</ref> His wife survived him.\n\n==Quotations==\nOn [[capital punishment]]: \n<blockquote>\u201cSome men, probably, abstain from murder because they fear that, if they committed murder, they would be hung.

As on 30.11.2015, NTPC has 110 MW Solar PV capacity under operation, 250 MW under construction and 1260 MW under tendering. The company intends to add 10000 MW of Solar PV capacity in next 5 years. On 18.07.2015, NTPC declared commercial its first Hydro Power plant at Koldam in the State of Himachal Pradesh.  By the year 2032, Company has a long term plan to reduce its fossil fuel capacity mix to 56%.\n\nNTPC also plans to go global. The public sector company has signed a memorandum of agreement with the Government of [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Ceylon Electricity Board]] for setting up a 500 MW (2x250) coal-based thermal power plant in the island nation. An MoU has also been signed with Kyushu Electric Power Co. Inc., [[Japan]], for establishing an alliance for exchange of information and experts from different areas of the business. The company is also in the process of finalising an MoU with [[Nigeria]] for setting up power plants against allocation of LNG on long-term basis for NTPC plants in India. NTPC also developing a joint-venture coal-based power plant 1,320 MW (2x660) with [[Bangladesh Power Development Board]] known as [[Rampal Power Station (Proposed)|Bangladesh India Friendship Power Company]] in [[Rampal Power Station (Proposed)|Rampal]], [[Bangladesh]] which is facing tremendous opposition from the people of [[Bangladesh]] owing to the plant's dangerously close proximity to the Sundarbans.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/2016/08/23/power-plant-like-rampal-never-allowed-india/|title='A power plant like Rampal would never be allowed in India' - Dhaka Tribune|website=www.dhakatribune.com}}</ref>\n\nNTPC has also been allotted  coal blocks namely, Pakri Barwadih, Chatti Bariatu and Kerandari in Jharkhand, Talipalli, Chhattisgarh and Dulanga, Odisha.

Some of these lands have been allotted to NTPC (and other PSUs in India) through Land Acquisition Acts passed by Central/State Governments. Wherever a land acquisition law is enacted, it also places a liability on the PSUs/governments to take actions for proper rehabilitation of displaced residents of that rural/tribal area. Governments/PSUs are criticised if they do not fulfill their liability towards displaced residents. In many areas where land acquisition is proposed through land acquisition laws, local residents oppose the forcible acquisition as they are not sure of proper rehabilitation.\n\n'''Future growth''': Draft National Electricity Plan, 2016 prepared by GoI states that India does not need additional coal fired power plants till 2027 with the commissioning of various coal based power plants which are presently under construction.<ref>{{cite web| title=Draft National Electricity Plan, 2016, CEA| url=http://www.cea.nic.in/reports/committee/nep/nep_dec.pdf |accessdate=11 December 2016 }}</ref> India is no more facing regular power shortages to purchase electricity at high prices offering higher profit margins to the power generating companies. With the help of assured power purchase agreements (PPA) from the state owned DisComs, earlier NTPC was able to sell its power at higher margins on the deployed capital and higher overhead costs. Moreover, its main expertise of generating power from coal fired stations is becoming obsolete in terms of technology and economics against non conventional power generation like wind, solar, etc.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/ntpc-may-drop-further-expansion-plans-of-kudgi-thermal-project-in-karnataka/articleshow/57859308.cms |title= NTPC may drop further expansion plans of Kudgi thermal project in  Karnataka|accessdate=28 March 2016}}</ref> In future, for the satisfactory growth mainly from wind and solar power projects, NTPC shall be ready to slash all its extra profit margins on capital deployed to bring down the power sale price at par with the IPPs to secure the projects in open competitive bidding.\n\nGovernment has decided to scrap the coal fired power stations which are more than 25 years old to reduce the pollution.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/power/ntpc-to-phase-out-11000-mw-old-power-plants-in-five-years-piyush-goyal/55983681| title=NTPC to phase out 11000  MW old power plants in five years -

NTPC Limited is on an expansion spree to meet the power requirements of the country \u2013 it has targeted to add 14,058 MW in 12th Plan (From FY13 to FY 17) of which it had already added 4,170 MW in the year 2012-13, 1835 MW  in the year 2013-14 1290 MW in the year 2014-15 and 1150 MW from April 2015 to 30 November 2015.\n\nAs on 30 November 2015, the company has 23004 MW under construction. \nNTPC is diversifying its capacity mix with lots of emphasis on renewable energy. As on 30.11.2015, NTPC has 110 MW Solar PV capacity under operation, 250 MW under construction and 1260 MW under tendering. The company intends to add 10000 MW of Solar PV capacity in next 5 years. On 18.07.2015, NTPC declared commercial its first Hydro Power plant at Koldam in the State of Himachal Pradesh.  By the year 2032, Company has a long term plan to reduce its fossil fuel capacity mix to 56%.\n\nNTPC also plans to go global. The public sector company has signed a memorandum of agreement with the Government of [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Ceylon Electricity Board]] for setting up a 500 MW (2x250) coal-based thermal power plant in the island nation. An MoU has also been signed with Kyushu Electric Power Co. Inc., [[Japan]], for establishing an alliance for exchange of information and experts from different areas of the business. The company is also in the process of finalising an MoU with [[Nigeria]] for setting up power plants against allocation of LNG on long-term basis for NTPC plants in India. NTPC also developing a joint-venture coal-based power plant 1,320 MW (2x660) with [[Bangladesh Power Development Board]] known as [[Rampal Power Station (Proposed)|Bangladesh India Friendship Power Company]] in [[Rampal Power Station (Proposed)|Rampal]], [[Bangladesh]] which is facing tremendous opposition from the people of [[Bangladesh]] owing to the plant's dangerously close proximity to the Sundarbans.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/2016/08/23/power-plant-like-rampal-never-allowed-india/|title='A power plant like Rampal would never be allowed in India' - Dhaka Tribune|website=www.dhakatribune.com}}</ref>\n\nNTPC has also been allotted  coal blocks namely, Pakri Barwadih, Chatti Bariatu and Kerandari in Jharkhand, Talipalli, Chhattisgarh and Dulanga, Odisha.

Some of these lands have been allotted to NTPC (and other PSUs in India) through Land Acquisition Acts passed by Central/State Governments. Wherever a land acquisition law is enacted, it also places a liability on the PSUs/governments to take actions for proper rehabilitation of displaced residents of that rural/tribal area. Governments/PSUs are criticised if they do not fulfill their liability towards displaced residents. In many areas where land acquisition is proposed through land acquisition laws, local residents oppose the forcible acquisition as they are not sure of proper rehabilitation.\n\n'''Future growth''': Draft National Electricity Plan, 2016 prepared by GoI states that India does not need additional coal fired power plants till 2027 with the commissioning of various coal based power plants which are presently under construction.<ref>{{cite web| title=Draft National Electricity Plan, 2016, CEA| url=http://www.cea.nic.in/reports/committee/nep/nep_dec.pdf |accessdate=11 December 2016 }}</ref> India is no more facing regular power shortages to purchase electricity at high prices offering higher profit margins to the power generating companies. With the help of assured power purchase agreements (PPA) from the state owned DisComs, earlier NTPC was able to sell its power at higher margins on the deployed capital and higher overhead costs. Moreover, its main expertise of generating power from coal fired stations is becoming obsolete in terms of technology and economics against non conventional power generation like wind, solar, etc.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/ntpc-may-drop-further-expansion-plans-of-kudgi-thermal-project-in-karnataka/articleshow/57859308.cms |title= NTPC may drop further expansion plans of Kudgi thermal project in  Karnataka|accessdate=28 March 2016}}</ref> In future, for the satisfactory growth mainly from wind and solar power projects, NTPC shall be ready to slash all its extra profit margins on capital deployed to bring down the power sale price at par with the IPPs to secure the projects in open competitive bidding.\n\nGovernment has decided to scrap the coal fired power stations which are more than 25 years old to reduce the pollution.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/power/ntpc-to-phase-out-11000-mw-old-power-plants-in-five-years-piyush-goyal/55983681| title=NTPC to phase out 11000  MW old power plants in five years - Piyush Goyal|accessdate=26 February 2017}}</ref> Instead of scrapping old pulverised coal fired units, NTPC should replace coal with [[Torrefaction|torrefied]] crops waste/biomass as fuel in these units (nearly 11,000 MW) to make them profitable and productive assets without contributing to pollution.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.biomasscofiring.ca/images/stories/PDFs/WoodPelletCo-firingOverviewFutureMetrics.pdf| title=Overview of Wood Pellet Co-firing|accessdate=26 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nTo utilise its proven O&M expertise, NTPC may venture on major scale to implement the [[concentrated solar power|solar thermal storage power]] as they can offer clean and cheaper electricity than fossil fuel fired power generation plants<ref>{{cite web |url=http://helioscsp.com/dispatchable-solar-concentrated-solar-power-broke-price-records-in-2017/ |title=Dispatchable Concentrated Solar Power Broke Price Records in 2017 |accessdate= 22 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nRather than install emissions cutting technologies, NTPC has chosen to lobby the government to extend pollution reduction deadlines. <ref>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-ntpc-emissions-exclusive/exclusive-indias-ntpc-snubs-foreign-emissions-tech-shuts-out-ge-others-from-2-billion-orders-idUSKBN1YN0G1?il=0</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Companies|Energy}}\n* [[Electricity in India]]\n* [[Energy in India]]\n* [[List of companies of India]]\n* [[List of public sector undertakings in India]]\n* [[2017 NTPC power plant explosion]]\n{{Clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website}}\n* {{ finance links\n| name = NTPC\n| symbol = NTPC.NS\n}}\n\n{{NTPC Power Stations}}\n{{Indian PSU}}\n{{BSE Sensex}}\n{{S&P CNX Nifty companies}}\n{{Public Sector Undertakings in India}}\n\n[[Category:Companies based in New Delhi]]\n[[Category:BSE SENSEX]]\n[[Category:CNX Nifty]]\n[[Category:Companies listed on the National Stock Exchange of India]]\n[[Category:Electric power companies of India]]\n[[Category:Government-owned companies of India]]\n[[Category:Public utilities established in 1975]]\n[[Category:Electric-generation companies of India]]\n[[Category:Ministry of Power (India)]]\n[[Category:1975 establishments in India]]\n", "name_user": "Coolvk07", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTPC_Limited"}

It was released on 16 January 1989 under the label of [[Virgin Records]]. The album features a more subdued tone than the immediate bombast of its predecessor, ''[[Broadcast (Cutting Crew album)|Broadcast]]''. Despite spawning the US Adult Contemporary No. 4 chart hit \"Everything But My Pride\", and positive fanfare from retrospective critics, it was met with little commercial or critical success.\n\n== Background ==\nFollowing the band's platinum-selling debut album ''Broadcast'' in 1986, propelled by the success of the massive No. 1 US hit \"[[(I Just) Died in Your Arms]]\" and another top 10 hit, \"[[I've Been in Love Before (song)|I've Been in Love Before]]\", the band was under  pressure by Virgin Records to deliver a follow-up LP to comparable levels of success. While ''(I Just) Died in Your Arms'' and ''I've Been in Love Before'' were contemporary hits, the success of ''Broadcast'' was timid by comparison, and executives of Virgin Records were keen on the band delivering an album that both had radio-friendly singles and was popular on its own. It was recorded mostly at Curtis Schwartz' Studio in Sussex, England, in 1988, the second-ever album ever to be recorded at the studio<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/label/368398-Curtis-Schwartz-Studio|title=Curtis Schwartz Studio|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>. Additional recording took place in Black Barn in Surrey and Strawberry North in Lancashire. However, its release was delayed by a year due to personal and business-related issues<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707072650/http://cherryred.co.uk/cherrypop/product.php?display=cuttingcrew|title=Cherry Pop Records : Cutting Crew|date=2010-07-07|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>, by which point the landscape of pop music was undergoing great change as the influence of [[grunge]] was taking over. By the time it was released, three years after ''Broadcast'', most fans had moved on, and the album sold poorly with no hit singles.\n\n== Songs ==\nWhen asked during a December 2008 interview about his favorite track by Cutting Crew, vocalist [[Nick Van Eede]] spoke fondly of the album's title track, stating, \n\n\"'''The Scattering''.' I think it's one of my best lyrics, telling of how the small villages in rural communities can die out when the life blood youth move away to the big cities. We had a lot of fun recording it as we flew down from Scotland with The Whistle Binkies who were a fabulous and famous folk band. We had 5 hours to record all their parts which included Bodhran, fiddle, pipes and accordion. This is still a firm favourite when we play live, even without the folk band!\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.songfacts.com/blog/interviews/nick-van-eede-from-cutting-crew|title=Nick Van Eede from Cutting Crew : Songwriter Interviews|last=Songfacts|website=www.songfacts.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\nIn a different interview, Van Eede talked about his frustrations with the continuous delaying of the album before its release, stating the song \"(Between A) Rock and a Hard Place\" had lyrics pertaining to the scenario. \n\n\u201cWe wrote one slightly veiled song having a pop at US A&R antics in our 'Between a Rock and Hard Place' from ''The Scattering'' album. I sang, 'I got a brick but I can\u2019t find a window,' as they continually blocked our albums release for months making us lose so much momentum.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unmask.us/songwriters-c-e/cutting-crew/|title=Cutting Crew Song Meanings - Interview with Nick|last=Van Eede|first=|date=|website=Unmask Us|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\n== Critical Reception ==\nThe album received mixed reviews from critics upon release, although the consensus of the album has grown more positive since its release. The late release of the album - three years after ''Broadcast'' - is often seen as the primary reason for the band's stalling momentum and popularity. Michael Sutton of [[AllMusic]] wrote of the album, \"...while ''The Scattering'' doesn't have ear candy like the band's hit singles, the music is less-blatantly commercial and more personal. It's still slick stuff -- big '80s synthesizers, glossy FM radio guitars, in-your-face drums -- but Nick Van Eede's vocals have a frosty glow that creates a mood and sustains interest.\" He ends his review, with the anecdote, \"''The Scattering'' will probably seem dated to anyone who isn't an '80s enthusiast, but it's tasty nostalgia for people who remember the decade fondly. Cutting Crew were obviously infatuated with the arena-sized riffs of [[U2]] and [[Big Country]], and while the group doesn't reach those bands' creative heights, hook-packed material such as 'Everything but My Pride' and 'Tip of Your Tongue' finds them walking tall.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-scattering-mw0000199452|title=The Scattering - Cutting Crew {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=AllMusic|language=en-us|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 = AllMusic\n| rev1score = 6/10\n}}\n\n==== Aftermath ====\nAlthough now regarded in more positive light, ''The Scattering'' was quick to languish in obscurity, peaking at a mere No. 150 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. Its singles, too, failed to leave a lasting impact going into the 1990s. Dissuaded by the commercial under-performance of the album and its singles, bassist Colin Farley and drummer [[Frosty Beedle|Martin Beedle]] left the band. However, Van Eede and bandmate [[Kevin MacMichael|Kevin Macmichael]] pressed on, delivering one final Cutting Crew album in October 1992, ''Compus Mentus''. Once again, the album flopped, and Cutting Crew disbanded from 1993 until 2006, following the death of Macmichael in 2002, albeit under a different lineup. Cutting Crew continues to produce music today, though Van Eede is the sole remaining member from the original lineup.\n\n== Track Listing ==\n{{Track listing\n| all_writing = Nick Van Eede and Kevin Macmichael, except where noted\n| title9 = The Last Thing\n| writer12 = Eede\n| writer10 = Farley\n| writer8 = Eede, Macmichael, Colin Farley\n| writer7 = Eede, Macmichael, Martin Beedle\n| writer5 = Macmichael\n| length12 = 6:05\n| title12 = Brag\n| length11 = 1:31\n| title11 = Binkies Return (Instrumental)\n| total_length = 52:00\n| length10 = 5:35\n| title10 = Feel the Wedge\n| length9 = 3:57\n| length8 = 5:04\n| title1 = Year in the Wilderness\n| title8 = Reach For The Sky\n| length7 = 3:36\n| title7 = Tip of Your Tongue\n| length6 = 4:17\n| title6 = (Between A) Rock And A Hard Place\n| length5 = 3:43\n| title5 = Handcuffs For Houdini\n| length4 = 5:10\n| title4 = Everything But My Pride\n| length3 = 4:00\n| title3 = Big Noise\n| length2 = 5:01\n| title2 = The Scattering\n| length1 = 4:44\n| writer1 = Eede, Macmichael, Tony Moore\n}}\n\n== Personnel ==\n\n=== Cutting Crew ===\n\n* [[Nick Van Eede]] -

It was released on 16 January 1989 under the label of [[Virgin Records]]. The album features a more subdued tone than the immediate bombast of its predecessor, ''[[Broadcast (Cutting Crew album)|Broadcast]]''. Despite spawning the US Adult Contemporary No. 4 chart hit \"Everything But My Pride\", and positive fanfare from retrospective critics, it was met with little commercial or critical success.\n\n== Background ==\nFollowing the band's platinum-selling debut album ''Broadcast'' in 1986, propelled by the success of the massive No. 1 US hit \"[[(I Just) Died in Your Arms]]\" and another top 10 hit, \"[[I've Been in Love Before (song)|I've Been in Love Before]]\", the band was under  pressure by Virgin Records to deliver a follow-up LP to comparable levels of success. While ''(I Just) Died in Your Arms'' and ''I've Been in Love Before'' were contemporary hits, the success of ''Broadcast'' was timid by comparison, and executives of Virgin Records were keen on the band delivering an album that both had radio-friendly singles and was popular on its own. It was recorded mostly at Curtis Schwartz' Studio in Sussex, England, in 1988, the second-ever album ever to be recorded at the studio<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/label/368398-Curtis-Schwartz-Studio|title=Curtis Schwartz Studio|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>. Additional recording took place in Black Barn in Surrey and Strawberry North in Lancashire. However, its release was delayed by a year due to personal and business-related issues<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707072650/http://cherryred.co.uk/cherrypop/product.php?display=cuttingcrew|title=Cherry Pop Records : Cutting Crew|date=2010-07-07|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>, by which point the landscape of pop music was undergoing great change as the influence of [[grunge]] was taking over. By the time it was released, three years after ''Broadcast'', most fans had moved on, and the album sold poorly with no hit singles.\n\n== Songs ==\nWhen asked during a December 2008 interview about his favorite track by Cutting Crew, vocalist [[Nick Van Eede]] spoke fondly of the album's title track, stating, \n\n\"'''The Scattering''.' I think it's one of my best lyrics, telling of how the small villages in rural communities can die out when the life blood youth move away to the big cities. We had a lot of fun recording it as we flew down from Scotland with The Whistle Binkies who were a fabulous and famous folk band. We had 5 hours to record all their parts which included Bodhran, fiddle, pipes and accordion. This is still a firm favourite when we play live, even without the folk band!\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.songfacts.com/blog/interviews/nick-van-eede-from-cutting-crew|title=Nick Van Eede from Cutting Crew : Songwriter Interviews|last=Songfacts|website=www.songfacts.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\nIn a different interview, Van Eede talked about his frustrations with the continuous delaying of the album before its release, stating the song \"(Between A) Rock and a Hard Place\" had lyrics pertaining to the scenario. \n\n\u201cWe wrote one slightly veiled song having a pop at US A&R antics in our 'Between a Rock and Hard Place' from ''The Scattering'' album. I sang, 'I got a brick but I can\u2019t find a window,' as they continually blocked our albums release for months making us lose so much momentum.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unmask.us/songwriters-c-e/cutting-crew/|title=Cutting Crew Song Meanings - Interview with Nick|last=Van Eede|first=|date=|website=Unmask Us|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\n== Critical Reception ==\nThe album received mixed reviews from critics upon release, although the consensus of the album has grown more positive since its release. The late release of the album - three years after ''Broadcast'' - is often seen as the primary reason for the band's stalling momentum and popularity. Michael Sutton of [[AllMusic]] wrote of the album, \"...while ''The Scattering'' doesn't have ear candy like the band's hit singles, the music is less-blatantly commercial and more personal. It's still slick stuff -- big '80s synthesizers, glossy FM radio guitars, in-your-face drums -- but Nick Van Eede's vocals have a frosty glow that creates a mood and sustains interest.\" He ends his review, with the anecdote, \"''The Scattering'' will probably seem dated to anyone who isn't an '80s enthusiast, but it's tasty nostalgia for people who remember the decade fondly. Cutting Crew were obviously infatuated with the arena-sized riffs of [[U2]] and [[Big Country]], and while the group doesn't reach those bands' creative heights, hook-packed material such as 'Everything but My Pride' and 'Tip of Your Tongue' finds them walking tall.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-scattering-mw0000199452|title=The Scattering - Cutting Crew {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=AllMusic|language=en-us|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 = AllMusic\n| rev1score = 6/10\n}}\n\n==== Aftermath ====\nAlthough now regarded in more positive light, ''The Scattering'' was quick to languish in obscurity, peaking at a mere No. 150 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. Its singles, too, failed to leave a lasting impact going into the 1990s. Dissuaded by the commercial under-performance of the album and its singles, bassist Colin Farley and drummer [[Frosty Beedle|Martin Beedle]] left the band. However, Van Eede and bandmate [[Kevin MacMichael|Kevin Macmichael]] pressed on, delivering one final Cutting Crew album in October 1992, ''Compus Mentus''. Once again, the album flopped, and Cutting Crew disbanded from 1993 until 2006, following the death of Macmichael in 2002, albeit under a different lineup. Cutting Crew continues to produce music today, though Van Eede is the sole remaining member from the original lineup.\n\n== Track Listing ==\n{{Track listing\n| all_writing = Nick Van Eede and Kevin Macmichael, except where noted\n| title9 = The Last Thing\n| writer12 = Eede\n| writer10 = Farley\n| writer8 = Eede, Macmichael, Colin Farley\n| writer7 = Eede, Macmichael, Martin Beedle\n| writer5 = Macmichael\n| length12 = 6:05\n| title12 = Brag\n| length11 = 1:31\n| title11 = Binkies Return (Instrumental)\n| total_length = 52:00\n| length10 = 5:35\n| title10 = Feel the Wedge\n| length9 = 3:57\n| length8 = 5:04\n| title1 = Year in the Wilderness\n| title8 = Reach For The Sky\n| length7 = 3:36\n| title7 = Tip of Your Tongue\n| length6 = 4:17\n| title6 = (Between A) Rock And A Hard Place\n| length5 = 3:43\n| title5 = Handcuffs For Houdini\n| length4 = 5:10\n| title4 = Everything But My Pride\n| length3 = 4:00\n| title3 = Big Noise\n| length2 = 5:01\n| title2 = The Scattering\n| length1 = 4:44\n| writer1 = Eede, Macmichael, Tony Moore\n}}\n\n== Personnel ==\n\n=== Cutting Crew ===\n\n* [[Nick Van Eede]] - lead vocals\n* [[Kevin MacMichael|Kevin Scott Macmichael]] - lead guitar, backing vocals\n* Colin Farley - bass guitar, backing vocals\n* [[Frosty Beedle|Martin Beetle]] - drums, percussion, backing vocals\n\n==== Additional Personnel ====\n\n* Jackie Rawe - additional vocals (Tracks 4 and 10)\n* Chyna and Marcia Johnson - additional vocals (Track 3)\n* Charles Bowyer - additional vocals (Track 3)\n* The Strawberry Chorale - additional vocals (Track 5)\n* Danny Cummings - percussion (Track 8)\n* Ronnie Aspery - saxophone (Track 9)\n* Eddie McGuire - flute (Track 2)\n* Mark Hayward - fiddle (Track 2)\n* Rab Wallace - pipes (Track 2)\n* Stuart Cydmann - [[squeezebox]] (Track 2)\n* Mick Broderick - [[Bodhr\u00e1n|bodhran]] (Track 2)\n\n==== Production ====\n\n* Produced by Cutting Crew, Peter-John Vettese, Don Gehman (Track 4)\n* Engineered by Curtis Schwartz\n* Mixed by Hugh Padgham\n\n== Charts ==\n\n=== Album<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/cutting-crew/chart-history/billboard-200|title=Cutting Crew Album Charts|last=|first=|date=|website=Billboard|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n!Chart\n!Peak Position\n|-\n|US Billboard 200\n|150\n|}\n\n=== Singles<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/cutting-crew/chart-history/RTT|title=Cutting Crew US Mainstream Rock/AOR Singles Charts|last=|first=|date=|website=Billboard|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/23549/cutting-crew/|title=CUTTING CREW {{!}} full Official Chart History {{!}} Official Charts Company|website=www.officialcharts.com|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Single\n!B-Side\n!Chart\n!Peak Position\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" |\"(Between A) Rock and a Hard Place\"\n| rowspan=\"4\" |\"Card House\" <small>(Live 1988)</small>\n|US Mainstream Rock\n|41\n|-\n|US Hot 100\n|77\n|-\n|Canadian Singles Chart\n|54\n|-\n|UK Singles Chart\n|66\n|-\n|\"The Scattering\"\n|\"Christians\"\n|UK Singles Chart\n|96\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\"Everything But My Pride\"\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\"Contact High\"\n|US Adult Contemporary\n|4\n|-\n|Canadian Singles Chart\n|72\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\"The Last Thing\"\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\"Handcuffs For Houdini\"\n|US Adult Contemporary\n|17\n|-\n|Canadian Singles Chart\n|90\n|}\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n__FORCETOC__\n\n{{Cutting Crew}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Broadcast (Cutting Crew Album)}}\n[[Category:Cutting Crew albums]]\n[[Category:Virgin Records albums]]\n", "name_user": "Supah Cole", "label": "safe", "comment": "Changes it so that outside websites can link it.

A major religious hub in [[India]], it is the [[Holy city|holiest]] of the seven sacred cities (''[[Sapta Puri]]'') in [[Hinduism]] and [[Jainism]], and played an important role in the development of [[Buddhism]] and [[Ravidassia]]. Varanasi lies along [[National Highway 2 (India, old numbering)|National Highway 2]] and is served by [[Varanasi Junction railway station]] and [[Lal Bahadur Shastri International Airport]].\n\nVaranasi grew as an important industrial centre famous for its [[muslin]] and silk fabrics, perfumes, ivory works, and sculpture. Buddha is believed to have founded Buddhism here around 528 BCE when he gave his first sermon, \"[[Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta|The Setting in Motion of the Wheel of Dharma]]\", at nearby [[Sarnath]]. The city's religious importance continued to grow in the 8th century, when [[Adi Shankara]] established the [[Shaivism|worship of Shiva]] as an official sect of Varanasi. During the Muslim rule through the Middle Ages, the city continued as an important centre of Hindu devotion, pilgrimage, [[mysticism]] and poetry which further contributed to its reputation as a centre of cultural importance and religious education. [[Tulsidas]] wrote his epic poem on [[Rama|Rama's]] life called ''[[Ram Charit Manas]]'' in Varanasi. Several other major figures of the [[Bhakti movement]] were born in Varanasi, including [[Kabir]] and [[Ravidas]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sundayguardianlive.com/culture/spirit-kabir-took-ancient-ghats-benares|title=When the spirit of Kabir took over the ancient ghats of Benares|date=30 November 2019|website=The Sunday Guardian Live|language=en-US|access-date=29 December 2019}}</ref> [[Guru Nanak]] visited Varanasi for [[Maha Shivaratri]] in 1507, a trip that played a large role in the founding of [[Sikhism]].\n\nIn the 16th century, Varanasi experienced a cultural revival under the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal emperor]] [[Akbar]] who patronised the city, and built two large temples dedicated to [[Shiva]] and [[Vishnu]], though much of modern Varanasi was built during the 18th century, by the [[Maratha Empire|Maratha]] and [[Brahmin]] kings. The [[Benares State|Kingdom of Benares]] was given official status by the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] in 1737, and continued as a dynasty-governed area until Indian independence in 1947. The city is governed by the Varanasi Nagar Nigam (Municipal Corporation) and is represented in the [[Parliament of India]] by the current Prime Minister of India [[Narendra Modi]], who won the [[Lok Sabha]] elections in 2014 by a huge margin. [[Silk weaving in Varanasi|Silk weaving]], carpets and crafts and tourism employ a significant number of the local population, as do the [[Diesel Locomotive Works]] and [[Bharat Heavy Electricals]]. Varanasi Hospital's foundation stone was laid by the then governor [[Kanaiyalal Maneklal Munshi]] in 1954 and it was inaugurated by former president [[S.

Hindus believe that dying here and getting cremated along the banks of the \"holy\" Ganges river allows one to break the cycle of rebirth and attain [[moksha|salvation]],<ref>{{cite web |title=India's City Where People Come to Die |date=18 June 2019 |author=Romita Saluja |website=BBC |url=http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20190617-indias-city-where-people-come-to-die}}</ref> making it a major center for pilgrimage. The city is known worldwide for its many [[Ghats in Varanasi|ghats]], embankments made in steps of stone slabs along the river bank where pilgrims perform ritual ablutions. Of particular note are the [[Dashashwamedh Ghat]], the Panchganga Ghat, the [[Manikarnika Ghat]] and the Harishchandra Ghat, the last two being where Hindus cremate their dead and the [[Hindu genealogy registers at Varanasi]] are kept here.\n\nThe [[Ramnagar Fort]], near the eastern bank of the Ganges, was built in the 18th century in the [[Mughal architecture|Mughal]] style of [[architecture]] with carved balconies, open courtyards, and scenic pavilions. Among the estimated 23,000 temples in Varanasi are [[Kashi Vishwanath Temple]] of Shiva, the [[Sankat Mochan Hanuman Temple]], and the [[Durga Mandir, Varanasi|Durga Temple]]. The [[Kashi Naresh]] ([[Maharaja]] of Kashi) is the chief cultural patron of Varanasi, and an essential part of all religious celebrations. An educational and musical centre, many prominent Indian philosophers, poets, writers, and musicians live or have lived in the city, and it was the place where the [[Benares gharana]] form of [[Hindustani classical music]] was developed. One of Asia's largest residential universities is [[Banaras Hindu University]] (BHU). The Hindi-language nationalist newspaper, ''[[Aj (newspaper)|Aj]]'', was first published in 1920.\n\n== Etymology ==\nTraditional etymology links \"Varanasi\" to the names of two [[Ganges]] tributaries forming the city's borders: [[Varuna River|Varuna]], still flowing in northern Varanasi, and Assi, today a small stream in the southern part of the city, near Assi Ghat. The old city is located on the north shores of the [[Ganges]], bounded by Varuna and Assi.{{Sfn|Cunningham|Sastri|2002|pp=131\u2013140}}\n\nIn the [[Rigveda]], an ancient Indian sacred collection of [[Vedic Sanskrit]] hymns, the city is referred to as K\u0101\u015b\u012b (\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0940: Kashi) from the Sanskrit verbal root ''ka\u015b-'' \"to shine\", making Varanasi known as \"City of Light\",{{Sfn|Eck|1982|p=10, 58, refers to \"Banares \u2013 which Hindus call Kashi, the City of Light\" (p. 10) and \"Hindus call it Kashi, the luminous City of Light\" (p. 58).}} the \"luminous city as an eminent seat of learning\".<ref>{{cite web |title=The Geography of the Rigveda |url=http://voi.org/books/rig/ch4.htm |last=Talageri |first=Shrikant G. |access-date=4 February 2007 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60pvfNrKV?url=http://voi.org/books/rig/ch4.htm |archivedate=10 August 2011  }}</ref> The name was also used by pilgrims dating from [[Buddha]]'s days.\n\nHindu religious texts use many epithets to refer to Varanasi, such as K\u0101\u015bik\u0101 (\u0915\u093e\u0936\u093f\u0915\u093e: {{lang-sa|\"the shining one\"}}), Avimukta (\u0905\u0935\u093f\u092e\u0941\u0915\u094d\u0924: {{lang-sa|\"never forsaken\"}} by Shiva), \u0100nandavana (\u0906\u0928\u0902\u0926\u0935\u0928\u093e: {{lang-sa|\"the forest of bliss\"}}), and Rudrav\u0101sa (\u0930\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0930\u0935\u093e\u0938\u093e: {{lang-sa|\"the place where Rudra/\u015aiva resides\"}}).<ref name=\"Varanasi: About the city\"/>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Hindu Mythology ===\nAccording to Hindu mythology, Varanasi was founded by [[Shiva]],{{sfn|Melton|2007|p=29}} one of [[Trimurti|three principal deities]] along with [[Brahma]] and [[Vishnu]]. During a fight between Brahma and Shiva, one of Brahma's five heads was torn off by Shiva. As was the custom, the victor carried the slain adversary's head in his hand and let it hang down from his hand as an act of ignominy, and a sign of his own bravery. A bridle was also put into the mouth. Shiva thus dishonored Brahma's head, and kept it with him at all times. When he came to the city of Varanasi in this state, the hanging head of Brahma dropped from Shiva's hand and disappeared in the ground. Varanasi is therefore considered an extremely holy site.<ref>[[Edward Sachau]], 1910, [http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/digital/collections/cul/texts/ldpd_5949073_002/pages/ldpd_5949073_002_00000155.html ''Alberuni's India''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180303145703/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/digital/collections/cul/texts/ldpd_5949073_002/pages/ldpd_5949073_002_00000155.html |date=3 March 2018 }}, p. 147, London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner & Co.

A major religious hub in [[India]], it is the [[Holy city|holiest]] of the seven sacred cities (''[[Sapta Puri]]'') in [[Hinduism]] and [[Jainism]], and played an important role in the development of [[Buddhism]] and [[Ravidassia]]. Varanasi lies along [[National Highway 2 (India, old numbering)|National Highway 2]] and is served by [[Varanasi Junction railway station]] and [[Lal Bahadur Shastri International Airport]].\n\nVaranasi grew as an important industrial centre famous for its [[muslin]] and silk fabrics, perfumes, ivory works, and sculpture. Buddha is believed to have founded Buddhism here around 528 BCE when he gave his first sermon, \"[[Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta|The Setting in Motion of the Wheel of Dharma]]\", at nearby [[Sarnath]]. The city's religious importance continued to grow in the 8th century, when [[Adi Shankara]] established the [[Shaivism|worship of Shiva]] as an official sect of Varanasi. During the Muslim rule through the Middle Ages, the city continued as an important centre of Hindu devotion, pilgrimage, [[mysticism]] and poetry which further contributed to its reputation as a centre of cultural importance and religious education. [[Tulsidas]] wrote his epic poem on [[Rama|Rama's]] life called ''[[Ram Charit Manas]]'' in Varanasi. Several other major figures of the [[Bhakti movement]] were born in Varanasi, including [[Kabir]] and [[Ravidas]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sundayguardianlive.com/culture/spirit-kabir-took-ancient-ghats-benares|title=When the spirit of Kabir took over the ancient ghats of Benares|date=30 November 2019|website=The Sunday Guardian Live|language=en-US|access-date=29 December 2019}}</ref> [[Guru Nanak]] visited Varanasi for [[Maha Shivaratri]] in 1507, a trip that played a large role in the founding of [[Sikhism]].\n\nIn the 16th century, Varanasi experienced a cultural revival under the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal emperor]] [[Akbar]] who patronised the city, and built two large temples dedicated to [[Shiva]] and [[Vishnu]], though much of modern Varanasi was built during the 18th century, by the [[Maratha Empire|Maratha]] and [[Brahmin]] kings. The [[Benares State|Kingdom of Benares]] was given official status by the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] in 1737, and continued as a dynasty-governed area until Indian independence in 1947. The city is governed by the Varanasi Nagar Nigam (Municipal Corporation) and is represented in the [[Parliament of India]] by the current Prime Minister of India [[Narendra Modi]], who won the [[Lok Sabha]] elections in 2014 by a huge margin.

The city is known worldwide for its many [[Ghats in Varanasi|ghats]], embankments made in steps of stone slabs along the river bank where pilgrims perform ritual ablutions. Of particular note are the [[Dashashwamedh Ghat]], the Panchganga Ghat, the [[Manikarnika Ghat]] and the Harishchandra Ghat, the last two being where Hindus cremate their dead and the [[Hindu genealogy registers at Varanasi]] are kept here.\n\nThe [[Ramnagar Fort]], near the eastern bank of the Ganges, was built in the 18th century in the [[Mughal architecture|Mughal]] style of [[architecture]] with carved balconies, open courtyards, and scenic pavilions. Among the estimated 23,000 temples in Varanasi are [[Kashi Vishwanath Temple]] of Shiva, the [[Sankat Mochan Hanuman Temple]], and the [[Durga Mandir, Varanasi|Durga Temple]]. The [[Kashi Naresh]] ([[Maharaja]] of Kashi) is the chief cultural patron of Varanasi, and an essential part of all religious celebrations. An educational and musical centre, many prominent Indian philosophers, poets, writers, and musicians live or have lived in the city, and it was the place where the [[Benares gharana]] form of [[Hindustani classical music]] was developed. One of Asia's largest residential universities is [[Banaras Hindu University]] (BHU). The Hindi-language nationalist newspaper, ''[[Aj (newspaper)|Aj]]'', was first published in 1920.\n\n== Etymology ==\nTraditional etymology links \"Varanasi\" to the names of two [[Ganges]] tributaries forming the city's borders: [[Varuna River|Varuna]], still flowing in northern Varanasi, and Assi, today a small stream in the southern part of the city, near Assi Ghat.

During a fight between Brahma and Shiva, one of Brahma's five heads was torn off by Shiva. As was the custom, the victor carried the slain adversary's head in his hand and let it hang down from his hand as an act of ignominy, and a sign of his own bravery. A bridle was also put into the mouth. Shiva thus dishonored Brahma's head, and kept it with him at all times. When he came to the city of Varanasi in this state, the hanging head of Brahma dropped from Shiva's hand and disappeared in the ground. Varanasi is therefore considered an extremely holy site.<ref>[[Edward Sachau]], 1910, [http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/digital/collections/cul/texts/ldpd_5949073_002/pages/ldpd_5949073_002_00000155.html ''Alberuni's India''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180303145703/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/digital/collections/cul/texts/ldpd_5949073_002/pages/ldpd_5949073_002_00000155.html |date=3 March 2018 }}, p. 147, London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner & Co.
