During the [[Second World War]], British-trained Nigerian troops saw action with the [[1st (West Africa) Infantry Brigade]], the [[81st (West Africa) Division|81st]] and the [[82nd (West Africa) Division]]s which fought in the [[East African Campaign (World War II)]] and in the Far East.\n\nThe roots of the ethnic cleavages which started to rip through the army after independence had some of their origins in British recruiting practices, with line infantry and the artillery being raised from the North, but during the expansion of the force during the [[Second World War]] a large proportion of more educated southerners being brought in to take up posts that required more technical training. Like in [[Ghana Army|Ghana]], there was significant pressure to \"Nigerianize\" the armed forces, with, for example, two officers being promoted to Brigadier as a concession to public opinion on the occasion of the last British commander arriving in Lagos. From a force of 8,000 in five infantry battalions and supporting units,<ref>Gutteridge, Military in African Politics, 1969, 97.</ref> strength rose to around 120,000 in three divisions by the end of the [[Nigerian Civil War]] in 1970.<ref>Scott report, ''Sunday Telegraph'', 11 January 1970, via N.J. Miners, ''The Nigerian Army 1956-65'', Methuen and Co. Ltd, London, 1971, p. 229</ref> In terms of doctrine, the task of the Federal Nigerian army did not fundamentally change: its task remained to close with and defeat an organized enemy.\n\nThe rapid expansion saw a severe decline in troop quality.<ref>https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/the-nigerian-military-is-so-broken-its-soldiers-are-refusing-to-fight/2015/05/06/d56fabac-dcae-11e4-b6d7-b9bc8acf16f7_story.html</ref> The Nigerian expansion process led to an extreme shortage of commissioned officers, with newly created lieutenant-colonels commanding brigades, and platoons and companies often commanded by sergeants and warrant officers. This resulted in tentative [[command and control|command-and-control]] and in rudimentary staff work.<ref>Neville Brown, \"The Nigerian Civil War,\" Military Review, vol. 48, October 1968, p. 28, cited in Major Michael Stafford, Quick Kill in Slow Motion, Marine Corps CSC, 1984, at http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1984/SMR.htm</ref> One result of the weak direction was that the Federals' three divisions fought independently, and competed for men and material. Writing in a 1984 study, Major Michael Stafford of the US Marine Corps noted that \"Inexperienced, poorly trained and ineptly led soldiers manifested their lack of professionalism and indiscipline by massacres of innocent civilians and a failure to effectively execute infantry tactics.\"<ref>Stafford study, 1984</ref> Among the results was the 1967 [[Asaba massacre]].\n\nThe influence of individual personalities is generally greater in the armies of developing states, as they tend to have weaker institutional frameworks. Key personalities involved in Nigeria included then-Colonel [[Olusegun Obasanjo]]. Obasanjo is particularly important due to his efforts to reorganize his command, [[3rd Division (Nigeria)|3 Division]], during the civil war to improve its logistics and administration. The reorganization he instituted made the Division capable of carrying out the offensive that ended the civil war.\n\nThe U.S. intelligence community concluded in November 1970 that \"..The [[Nigerian Civil War]] ended with relatively little rancor. The Igbos are accepted as fellow citizens in many parts of Nigeria, but not in some areas of former [[Biafra]] where they were once dominant. Igboland is an overpopulated, economically depressed area where massive unemployment is likely to continue for many years.<ref name=NIE64-2-70>{{citation|title=National Intelligence Estimate 64.2-70: Prospects for Postwar Nigeria |author=Central Intelligence Agency |url=http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/53862.pdf |date=2 November 1970 |publisher=[[United States Department of State]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20090809041637/http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/53862.pdf |archivedate=9 August 2009 }}</ref>\n{{check quotation}}\nThe U.S. analysts said that \"..Nigeria is still very much a tribal society...\" where local and tribal alliances count more than \"national attachment. General [[Yakubu Gowon]], head of the Federal Military Government (FMG) is the accepted national leader and his popularity has grown since the end of the war. The FMG is neither very efficient nor dynamic, but the recent announcement that it intends to retain power for six more years has generated little opposition so far. The Nigerian Army, vastly expanded during the war, is both the main support to the FMG and the chief threat to it. The troops are poorly trained and disciplined and some of the officers are turning to conspiracies and plotting. We think Gowon will have great difficulty in staying in office through the period which he said is necessary before the turnover of power to civilians. His sudden removal would dim the prospects for Nigerian stability.\"\n\nThe Nigerian Army fought the Civil War significantly under-resourced; Obasanjo's memoirs chronicle the lack of any stocks of extra equipment for mobilisation and the \"haphazard and unreliable system of procurement and provisioning\" which lasted for the entire period of the war.<ref>Olusegun Obasanjo, ''My Command: An Account of the Nigerian Civil War'', Heinemann, Ibadan/London/Nairobi, 1980, p. 61</ref> Arms embargoes imposed by several Western countries made the situation more difficult.\n\nAt the end of the Civil War, the three divisions of the Army were reorganised into four divisions, with each controlling territories running from North to South in order to deemphasise the former regional structure. Each division thus had access to the sea thereby making triservice cooperation and logistic support easier. This deployment formula was later abandoned in favour of the present assignment of sectors to the divisions. Thus 1 Division with HQ at Kaduna is allocated the North West sector; 2 Division with HQ at Ibadan South West sector, 3 Division with HQ at Jos North East sector and 82 Division with HQ at Enugu South East sector.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://logbaby.com/directory/nigerian-army_6193.html|title=Nigerian Army Logbaby|website=logbaby.com|access-date=2020-01-22}}</ref>\n\nIts formations include the [[1st Division (Nigeria)|1 Division]], headquartered in [[Kaduna]] in the north-west, and [[2 Division (Nigeria)|2 Division]] (HQ [[Ibadan]] in the South-West, which includes 32 Artillery Brigade at [[Abeokuta]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisdayonline.com/archive/2004/04/20/20040420spo06.html|title=Home|website=Thisdayonline.com|accessdate=15 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110115213808/http://www.thisdayonline.com/archive/2004/04/20/20040420spo06.html|archive-date=15 January 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> 2nd Division also possibly includes 4 Brigade at [[Benin City]], with 19 Battalion at [[Okitipupa]] and 195 Battalion at [[Agenebode]]. 52 Signal Regiment may be the divisional signals unit.

During the [[Second World War]], British-trained Nigerian troops saw action with the [[1st (West Africa) Infantry Brigade]], the [[81st (West Africa) Division|81st]] and the [[82nd (West Africa) Division]]s which fought in the [[East African Campaign (World War II)]] and in the Far East.\n\nThe roots of the ethnic cleavages which started to rip through the army after independence had some of their origins in British recruiting practices, with line infantry and the artillery being raised from the North, but during the expansion of the force during the [[Second World War]] a large proportion of more educated southerners being brought in to take up posts that required more technical training. Like in [[Ghana Army|Ghana]], there was significant pressure to \"Nigerianize\" the armed forces, with, for example, two officers being promoted to Brigadier as a concession to public opinion on the occasion of the last British commander arriving in Lagos. From a force of 8,000 in five infantry battalions and supporting units,<ref>Gutteridge, Military in African Politics, 1969, 97.</ref> strength rose to around 120,000 in three divisions by the end of the [[Nigerian Civil War]] in 1970.<ref>Scott report, ''Sunday Telegraph'', 11 January 1970, via N.J. Miners, ''The Nigerian Army 1956-65'', Methuen and Co. Ltd, London, 1971, p. 229</ref> In terms of doctrine, the task of the Federal Nigerian army did not fundamentally change: its task remained to close with and defeat an organized enemy.\n\nThe rapid expansion saw a severe decline in troop quality.<ref>https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/the-nigerian-military-is-so-broken-its-soldiers-are-refusing-to-fight/2015/05/06/d56fabac-dcae-11e4-b6d7-b9bc8acf16f7_story.html</ref> The Nigerian expansion process led to an extreme shortage of commissioned officers, with newly created lieutenant-colonels commanding brigades, and platoons and companies often commanded by sergeants and warrant officers. This resulted in tentative [[command and control|command-and-control]] and in rudimentary staff work.<ref>Neville Brown, \"The Nigerian Civil War,\" Military Review, vol. 48, October 1968, p. 28, cited in Major Michael Stafford, Quick Kill in Slow Motion, Marine Corps CSC, 1984, at http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1984/SMR.htm</ref> One result of the weak direction was that the Federals' three divisions fought independently, and competed for men and material. Writing in a 1984 study, Major Michael Stafford of the US Marine Corps noted that \"Inexperienced, poorly trained and ineptly led soldiers manifested their lack of professionalism and indiscipline by massacres of innocent civilians and a failure to effectively execute infantry tactics.\"<ref>Stafford study, 1984</ref> Among the results was the 1967 [[Asaba massacre]].\n\nThe influence of individual personalities is generally greater in the armies of developing states, as they tend to have weaker institutional frameworks. Key personalities involved in Nigeria included then-Colonel [[Olusegun Obasanjo]]. Obasanjo is particularly important due to his efforts to reorganize his command, [[3rd Division (Nigeria)|3 Division]], during the civil war to improve its logistics and administration. The reorganization he instituted made the Division capable of carrying out the offensive that ended the civil war.\n\nThe U.S. intelligence community concluded in November 1970 that \"..The [[Nigerian Civil War]] ended with relatively little rancor. The Igbos are accepted as fellow citizens in many parts of Nigeria, but not in some areas of former [[Biafra]] where they were once dominant. Igboland is an overpopulated, economically depressed area where massive unemployment is likely to continue for many years.<ref name=NIE64-2-70>{{citation|title=National Intelligence Estimate 64.2-70: Prospects for Postwar Nigeria |author=Central Intelligence Agency |url=http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/53862.pdf |date=2 November 1970 |publisher=[[United States Department of State]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20090809041637/http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/53862.pdf |archivedate=9 August 2009 }}</ref>\n{{check quotation}}\nThe U.S. analysts said that \"..Nigeria is still very much a tribal society...\" where local and tribal alliances count more than \"national attachment. General [[Yakubu Gowon]], head of the Federal Military Government (FMG) is the accepted national leader and his popularity has grown since the end of the war. The FMG is neither very efficient nor dynamic, but the recent announcement that it intends to retain power for six more years has generated little opposition so far. The Nigerian Army, vastly expanded during the war, is both the main support to the FMG and the chief threat to it. The troops are poorly trained and disciplined and some of the officers are turning to conspiracies and plotting. We think Gowon will have great difficulty in staying in office through the period which he said is necessary before the turnover of power to civilians. His sudden removal would dim the prospects for Nigerian stability.\"\n\nThe Nigerian Army fought the Civil War significantly under-resourced; Obasanjo's memoirs chronicle the lack of any stocks of extra equipment for mobilisation and the \"haphazard and unreliable system of procurement and provisioning\" which lasted for the entire period of the war.<ref>Olusegun Obasanjo, ''My Command: An Account of the Nigerian Civil War'', Heinemann, Ibadan/London/Nairobi, 1980, p. 61</ref> Arms embargoes imposed by several Western countries made the situation more difficult.\n\nAt the end of the Civil War, the three divisions of the Army were reorganised into four divisions, with each controlling territories running from North to South in order to deemphasise the former regional structure. Each division thus had access to the sea thereby making triservice cooperation and logistic support easier. This deployment formula was later abandoned in favour of the present assignment of sectors to the divisions. Thus 1 Division with HQ at Kaduna is allocated the North West sector; 2 Division with HQ at Ibadan South West sector, 3 Division with HQ at Jos North East sector and 82 Division with HQ at Enugu South East sector.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://logbaby.com/directory/nigerian-army_6193.html|title=Nigerian Army Logbaby|website=logbaby.com|access-date=2020-01-22}}</ref>\n\nIts formations include the [[1st Division (Nigeria)|1 Division]], headquartered in [[Kaduna]] in the north-west, and [[2 Division (Nigeria)|2 Division]] (HQ [[Ibadan]] in the South-West, which includes 32 Artillery Brigade at [[Abeokuta]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisdayonline.com/archive/2004/04/20/20040420spo06.html|title=Home|website=Thisdayonline.com|accessdate=15 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110115213808/http://www.thisdayonline.com/archive/2004/04/20/20040420spo06.html|archive-date=15 January 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> 2nd Division also possibly includes 4 Brigade at [[Benin City]], with 19 Battalion at [[Okitipupa]] and 195 Battalion at [[Agenebode]]. 52 Signal Regiment may be the divisional signals unit.

L.

He represented the riding from 2011<ref>[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/places/new-brunswick-ridings/election-fed2011/r13008/ Election 2011: New Brunswick Southwest]. ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', May 2, 2011.</ref> until his defeat in the [[2015 Canadian federal election|2015 election]]. He was elected again in the [[2019 Canadian federal election|2019 election]].\n\n==Education==\nWilliamson graduated from Fredericton High School, and then [[McGill University]] with a degree in economics and political science. He later went on to receive a master's degree in economic history at the [[London School of Economics]]. Befitting his elite education, Mr. Williamson is an heraldic heir, entitled to inherit a coat of arms. [https://reg.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/project.asp?lang=e&ProjectID=244]. Although he is a professed monarchist and his father's armorial achievement bears Loyalist symbolism, both his parents were born in the United States.

He had joined the taxpayers' watchdog group in September 2002 as provincial director in Ontario.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newswire.ca/fr/story/205651/media-advisory-john-williamson-to-leave-canadian-taxpayers-federation|title=''Canadian Newswire'', Media Advisory&nbsp;\u2014 John Williamson to leave Canadian Taxpayers Federation|accessdate=2013-05-16|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518084653/http://www.newswire.ca/fr/story/205651/media-advisory-john-williamson-to-leave-canadian-taxpayers-federation|archivedate=2015-05-18}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, Williamson was hired by Prime Minister Stephen Harper to become [[Director of Communications (Office of the Prime Minister)|director of communications]] in the PMO and oversaw government-wide communications from his [[Office of the Prime Minister (Canada)|PMO]] perch. He stepped down in 2010 in order to prepare his campaign after deciding to run for elected office, and was succeeded as director of communications by [[Dimitri Soudas]].\n\n==Member of Parliament==\nWilliamson was introduced, along with other candidates for the [[2011 Canadian federal election|41st Parliament]], to readers of the St. Croix Courier in an April 2011 interview.<ref>[http://stcroixcourier.ca/2011/apr/sc_apr_19_11-a_p01tp28.pdf \"The Saint Croix Courier - 19 April 2011\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518090038/http://stcroixcourier.ca/2011/apr/sc_apr_19_11-a_p01tp28.pdf |date=18 May 2015 }}, p.2</ref>\n\nWilliamson is an outspoken MP who sometimes speaks up against his own government policies, such as C-30,<ref>Globe and Mail: https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/facing-a-backlash-ottawa-moves-to-retool-cybercrime-bill/article2339856/</ref> a bill that ignited some controversy about online anonymity.\n\nWilliamson is also responsible for creating public calls for an oil pipeline from its Alberta origin to [[Saint John, New Brunswick]], that would carry undistilled petroleum product to the east and across the [[St. Lawrence River]] for refining at the [[J.
