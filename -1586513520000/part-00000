Furniture is also used to hold objects at a convenient height for work (as horizontal surfaces above the ground, such as tables and [[desk]]s), or to store things (e.g., [[cupboard]]s and [[Shelf (storage)|shelves]]). Furniture can be a product of design and is considered a form of [[decorative art]]. In addition to furniture's functional role, it can serve a symbolic or religious purpose. It can be made from many materials, including metal, plastic, and wood. Furniture can be made using a variety of [[woodworking joints]] which often reflect the local culture.\n\nPeople have been using natural objects, such as tree stumps, rocks and moss, as furniture since the beginning of human civilisation. Archaeological research shows that from around 30,000 years ago, people began constructing and carving their own furniture, using wood, stone, and animal bones. Early furniture from this period is known from artwork such as a [[Venus figurine]] found in [[Russia]], depicting the goddess on a throne. The first surviving extant furniture is in the homes of [[Skara Brae]] in [[Scotland]], and includes cupboards, dressers and beds all constructed from stone. Complex construction techniques such as [[joinery (woodworking)|joinery]] began in the [[Early Dynastic Period (Egypt)|early dynastic]] period of [[ancient Egypt]]. This era saw constructed wooden pieces, including [[stool (seat)|stools]] and tables, sometimes decorated with valuable metals or ivory. The evolution of furniture design continued in [[ancient Greece]] and [[ancient Rome]], with thrones being commonplace as well as the [[klinai]], multipurpose couches used for relaxing, eating, and sleeping. The furniture of the [[Middle Ages]] was usually heavy, [[oak]], and ornamented. Furniture design expanded during the Italian [[Renaissance]] of the fourteenth and fifteenth century. The seventeenth century, in both Southern and Northern Europe, was characterized by opulent, often gilded [[Baroque]] designs. The nineteenth century is usually defined by [[revival styles]]. The first three-quarters of the twentieth century are often seen as the march towards [[Modernism]]. One unique outgrowth of post-modern furniture design is a return to natural shapes and textures.<ref name=povo />\n\n==Etymology==\nThe [[English language|English]] word ''[[wikt:furniture|furniture]]'' is derived from the [[French language|French]] word ''[[wikt:fourniture|fourniture]]'',{{sfn|Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|2016}} the noun form of ''[[wikt:fournir|fournir]]'', which means to supply or provide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/french-english/fournir|title=English Translation of \"fournir\" \u2013 Collins French-English Dictionary|publisher=}}</ref> Thus ''fourniture'' in French means supplies or provisions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/french-english/fourniture|title=English Translation of \"fourniture\" \u2013 Collins French-English Dictionary|publisher=}}</ref> The English usage, referring specifically to household objects, is specific to that language;{{sfn|Weekley|2013|pp=609\u2013610}} French and other Romance languages as well as German use variants of the word ''[[wikt:meubles|meubles]]'', which derives from Latin ''[[wikt:mobilia|mobilia]]'', meaning \"moveable goods\".{{sfn|Solodow|2010|p=146}}\n\n==History==\n===Prehistoric furniture===\n[[File:Museum of Anatolian Civilizations 1320259 nevit.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Seated Woman of \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck]] statue is evidence that furniture existed in the [[neolithic]]]]\nThe practice of using natural objects as rudimentary pieces of furniture likely dates to the beginning of human civilisation.{{sfn|Smardzewski|2015|p=4}} Early humans are likely to have used tree stumps as seats, rocks as rudimentary tables, and mossy areas for sleeping.{{sfn|Smardzewski|2015|p=4}} During the late [[palaeolithic]] or early [[neolithic]] period, from around 30,000 years ago, people began constructing and carving their own furniture, using wood, stone and animal bones.{{sfn|Smardzewski|2015|p=1}} The earliest evidence for the existence of constructed furniture is a [[Venus figurine]] found at the [[Gagarino]] site in [[Russia]], which depicts the goddess in a sitting position, on a throne.{{sfn|Smardzewski|2015|p=2}} A similar [[Seated Woman of \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck|statue of a Mother Goddess]] was found in [[Catal Huyuk]] in [[Turkey]], dating to between 6000 and 5500 BCE.{{sfn|Smardzewski|2015|p=4}} The inclusion of such a seat in the figurines implies that these were already common artefacts of that age.{{sfn|Smardzewski|2015|p=2}}\n\n[[File:Skara Brae house 1 5.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Skara Brae]] house home furnishings, a dresser with shelves]]\nA range of unique stone furniture has been excavated in [[Skara Brae]], a [[Neolithic]] village in [[Orkney]], [[Scotland]]. The site dates from 3100\u20132500 BCE and due to a shortage of wood in Orkney, the people of Skara Brae were forced to build with stone, a readily available material that could be worked easily and turned into items for use within the household. Each [[house]] shows a high degree of sophistication and was equipped with an extensive assortment of stone furniture, ranging from cupboards, dressers and beds to shelves, stone seats, and [[limpet]] tanks. The stone dresser was regarded as the most important as it symbolically faces the entrance in each house and is therefore the first item seen when entering, perhaps displaying symbolic objects, including decorative artwork such as several Neolithic [[Carved Stone Balls]] also found at the site.\n\n[[Ancient Furniture|Ancient furniture]] has been excavated from the 8th-century BCE [[Phrygians|Phrygian]] [[tumulus]], the Midas Mound, in [[Gordion Furniture and Wooden Artifacts|Gordion]], [[Turkey]].

The use of [[scarf joint]]s to join two shorter pieces together and form a longer beam was one example of this,{{sfn|Smardzewski|2015|pp=13\u201314}} as well as construction of [[Wood veneer|veneers]] in which low quality cheap wood was used as the main building material, with a thin layer of expensive wood on the surface.{{sfn|Smardzewski|2015|p=14}}\n\nThe earliest used seating furniture in the dynastic period was the [[stool (seat)|stool]], which was used throughout Egyptian society, from the royal family down to ordinary citizens.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=15}} Various different designs were used, including stools with four vertical legs, and others with crossed splayed legs; almost all had rectangular seats, however.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=15}} Examples include the workman's stool, a simple three legged structure with a concave seat, designed for comfort during labour,{{sfn|Litchfield|2011|p=6}} and the much more ornate folding stool, with crossed folding legs,{{sfn|Litchfield|2011|pp=6\u20137}} which were decorated with carved duck heads and ivory,{{sfn|Litchfield|2011|pp=6\u20137}} and had hinges made of [[bronze]].{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=15}} Full [[chair]]s were much rarer in early Egypt, being limited to only wealthy and high ranking people, and seen as a status symbol; they did not reach ordinary households until the [[eighteenth dynasty]].{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=17}} Early examples were formed by adding a straight back to a stool, while later chairs had an inclined back.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=17}} Other furniture types in ancient Egypt include tables, which are heavily represented in art, but almost nonexistent as preserved items \u2013 perhaps because they were placed outside tombs rather than within,{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=21}} as well as beds and storage chests.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=22}}{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=24}}\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nStool with woven seat MET 14.10.3 view 4.jpg|Stool with woven seat; 1991\u20131450 BC; wood & reed; height: 13&nbsp;cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nJewelry chest of Sithathoryunet MET DP330328.jpg|Jewelry chest of Sithathoryunet; 1887\u20131813 BC; ebony, ivory, gold, carnelian, blue faience and silver; height: 36.7 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nEgyptian Museum 000 (37).jpg|The ''Throne of [[Tutankhamun]]''; 1336\u20131327 BC; wood covered with sheets of gold, silver, [[semi-precious stone|semi-precious]] and other stones, faience, glass and bronze; height: 1&nbsp;m; [[Egyptian Museum]] (Cairo)\n\nHatnefer's Chair MET 21M CAT047R4 (cropped).jpg|Chair of [[Hatnefer]]; 1492\u20131473&nbsp;BC; boxwood, cypress, ebony & linen cord; height: 53&nbsp;cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n</gallery>\n\n===Ancient Greece===\n[[File:Three illustrations of ancient Greek chairs, each being notated with a letter. a, b-klismos, and c-chair.jpg|thumb|225px|Three illustrations of ancient Greek chairs, each being notated with a letter: a, b-klismos, and c-chair]]\nHistorical knowledge of Greek furniture is derived from various sources, including [[Greek literature|literature]], [[terracotta]], sculptures, statuettes, and painted vases.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=39}} Some pieces survive to this day, primarily those constructed from metals, including bronze, or marble.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=39}} Wood was an important material in Greek furniture, both domestic and imported.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=39}} A common technique was to construct the main sections of the furniture with cheap solid wood, then apply a veneer using an expensive wood, such as maple or ebony.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=39}} Greek furniture construction also made use of [[dowels]] and [[Mortise and tenon|tenons]] for joining the wooden parts of a piece together.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=39}} Wood was shaped by carving, steam treatment, and the lathe, and furniture is known to have been decorated with ivory, tortoise shell, glass, gold or other precious materials.<ref>Richter, 125.</ref>\n\nThe modern word \u201c[[throne]]\u201d is derived from the ancient Greek ''thronos'' (Greek singular: \u03b8\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2), which was a seat designated for deities or individuals of high status or honor.<ref>Richter, 13.</ref> The colossal chryselephantine statue of [[Statue of Zeus at Olympia|Zeus at Olympia]], constructed by [[Phidias]] and lost in antiquity, featured the god Zeus seated on an elaborate throne, which was decorated with gold, precious stones, ebony and ivory, according to [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]].<ref>Richter, 14; NH 5.11.2ff.</ref> Other Greek seats included the ''[[klismos]]'', an elegant Greek chair with a curved backrest and legs whose form was copied by the Romans and is now part of the vocabulary of furniture design,<ref>Linda Maria Gigante, \u201cFunerary Art,\u201d in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome'', Vol. 1, ed.

Rome gradually superseded Greece as the foremost culture of Europe, leading eventually to Greece becoming a province of Rome in 146 BC. Rome thus took over production and distribution of Greek furniture, and the boundary between the two is blurred. The Romans did have some limited innovation outside of Greek influence, and styles distinctly their own.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=61}}\n\nRoman furniture was constructed principally using wood, metal and stone, with marble and limestone used for outside furniture. Very little wooden furniture survives intact, but there is evidence that a variety of woods were used, including maple, citron, beech, oak, and holly. Some imported wood such as satinwood was used for decoration. The most commonly used metal was bronze, of which numerous examples have survived, for example, headrests for couches and metal stools. Similar to the Greeks, [[Demography of the Roman Empire|Romans]] used tenons, dowels, nails, and glue to join wooden pieces together, and also practised veneering.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=61}}\n\nThe 1738 and 1748 excavations of [[Herculaneum]] and [[Pompeii]] revealed Roman furniture, preserved in the ashes of the AD 79 [[Eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79|eruption of Vesuvius]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nHandbook of ornament; a grammar of art, industrial and architectural designing in all its branches, for practical as well as theoretical use (1900) (14804265373).jpg|Illustration of Roman furniture details, from 1900, very similar with [[Empire style]] furniture\nClevelandart 1995.10.jpg|Tripod base; circa 100 BC; bronze; overall: 77 x 32.3 x 28&nbsp;cm; [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] ([[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], USA)\nForziere con sacrificio a giove, I secolo dc, legno, ferro e bronzo, con ageminature, dalla casa di trittolemo a pompei (napoli, man) 01.jpg|Treasure chest with a sacrifice of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] depicted on it; 1st century AD; wood, iron and bronze, with ageminature; from [[Pompeii]]; [[National Archaeological Museum, Naples|Naples National Archaeological Museum]] ([[Naples]], Italy)\nCouch and footstool with bone carvings and glass inlays MET DP138722.jpg|Couch and footstool with bone carvings and glass inlays; 1st\u20132nd century AD; wood, bone and glass; couch: 105.4 \u00d7 76.2 \u00d7 214.6&nbsp;cm; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\n</gallery>\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Medieval and Renaissance Europe===\n[[File:Cassone (one of a pair) MET DP106698.jpg|thumb|Renaissance [[cassone]]; circa 1550-1560; carved and partially gilded walnut; 86.4 x 181.9 x 67.3 cm; from [[Rome]]; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)]]\nIn contrast to the ancient civilisations of Egypt, Greece, and Rome, there is comparatively little evidence of furniture from the 5th to the 15th century.{{sfn|Lucie-Smith|1979|p=33}} Very few extant pieces survive, and evidence in literature is also scarce.{{sfn|Lucie-Smith|1979|p=33}} It is likely that the style of furniture prevalent in late antiquity persisted throughout the [[middle ages]].{{sfn|Lucie-Smith|1979|p=33}} For example, a throne similar to that of [[Zeus]] is depicted in a sixth-century [[diptych]],{{sfn|Lucie-Smith|1979|p=33}} while the [[Bayeux tapestry]] shows [[Edward the Confessor]] and [[Harold Godwinson|Harold]] seated on seats similar to the Roman [[sella curulis]].{{sfn|Lucie-Smith|1979|p=35}}\n\nThe furniture of the [[Middle Ages]] was usually heavy, [[oak]], and ornamented with carved designs. Along with the other arts, the Italian [[Renaissance]] of the fourteenth and fifteenth century marked a rebirth in design, often inspired by the [[Greco-Roman]] tradition. A similar explosion of design, and renaissance of culture in general occurred in Northern Europe, starting in the fifteenth century. The seventeenth century, in both Southern and Northern Europe, was characterized by opulent, often gilded [[Baroque]] designs that frequently incorporated a profusion of vegetal and scrolling ornament. Starting in the eighteenth century, furniture designs began to develop more rapidly. Although there were some styles that belonged primarily to one nation, such as [[Palladianism]] in [[Great Britain]] or [[Louis Quinze]] in [[French furniture]], others, such as the [[Rococo]] and [[Neoclassicism]] were perpetuated throughout Western Europe.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nCoffret (Minnek\u00e4stchen) MET DP273975.jpg|[[Gothic art|Gothic]] German coffret (Minnek\u00e4stchen); circa 1325-1350; oak, inlay, tempera, wrought-iron mounts; overall: 12.1 x 27.3 x 16.5; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\n\nPaschal Candlestick MET DP102923.jpg|Gothic Spanish paschal candlestick; circa 1450-1500; wood with paint and gilding; 195.6 \u00d7 43.8 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nCassone (chest), pair with 1975.1.1947 MET SLP1940-1.jpg|[[Renaissance]] cassone (chest); mid 16th century; walnut, carved and partially gilded, coniferous wood; height: 73.6 cm, width: 1.7 m, depth: 63.5 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nDresser (Dressoir aux harpies) MET DP105799.jpg|French Renaissance dresser (dressoir aux harpies); circa 1570-1590; carved walnut with interior elements of oak, pine, and some iron accessories; height: 144.8 cm, width: 137.8 cm, depth: 50.8 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n</gallery>\n\n===17th and 18th centuries===\nDuring the eighteenth century, the fashion was set in England by the French art. In the beginning of the century [[Boulle]] cabinets were at the peak of their popularity and [[Louis XIV]] was reigning in France. In this era, most of the furniture had metal and enamelled decorations in it and some of the furniture was covered in inlays of marbles lapis lazuli, and porphyry and other stones. By mid-century this [[Baroque]] style was displaced by the graceful curves, shining [[ormolu]], and intricate [[marquetry]] of the [[Rococo]] style, which in turn gave way around 1770 to the more severe lines of [[Neoclassicism]], modeled after the architecture of ancient Greece and Rome.\n<ref name=\"A history of feminine fashion\">{{cite book|author1=unknown|title=A history of feminine fashion|publisher=Nabu Pres|isbn= 978-1-289-62694-5|page=71}}</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nOlanda, guardaroba (kast), 1625-50 ca.jpg|Dutch wardrobe; 1625-1650; oak with ebony and rosewood veneers; overall: 244.5 x 224.3 x 85.2 cm; [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] ([[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], US)\n\nClevelandart 1968.31.jpg|Console table depicting [[Chronos]], or the father time; 1695; painted and gilded wood, with marble at its top; overall: 95.3 x 107.3 x 62.9 cm; Cleveland Museum of Art\n\nGermany, Mainz, 18th century - Gaming Table - 1953.284 - Cleveland Museum of Art.tif|Gaming Table; circa 1735; wood and ivory marquetry; overall: 78.7 x 94 x 54.6 cm; from [[Mainz]] (Germany); Cleveland Museum of Art\n\nCommode by Gilles Joubert, France, c. 1735, oak and walnut, veneered with tulipwood, ebony, holly, other woods, gilt bronze, imitation marble - Museum of Fine Arts, Boston - 20180922 164303.jpg|French commode; by [[Gilles Joubert]]; circa 1735; oak and walnut, veneered with tulipwood, ebony, holly, other woods, gilt bronze and imitation marble; [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Museum of Fine Arts]] ([[Boston]], USA)\n\nCommode MET DP105695.jpg|Parisian commode; 1745-1749; pine and oak veneered with amaranth and bois satin\u00e9, walnut, gilt-bronze mounts, and portoro marble top; 87.6 x 139.7 x 57.8 cm; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\n\nArmchair (fauteuil \u00e0 la reine) (part of a set) MET DP105705.jpg|Armchair (fauteuil \u00e0 la reine); circa 1754-1756; carved and gilded beech, wool and silk tapestry; overall: 103.8 \u00d7 73.7 \u00d7 66 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nJean pierre latz, commode, 1745-50 ca, con terracotta di un seguace di clodion.jpg|Rococo chest of drawers; circa 1750; oak, tulipwood marquetry, gilt metal mounts and marble; overall: 88 x 156.5 x 69.9 cm; Cleveland Museum of Art\n\nArmchair (fauteuil \u00e0 la reine) MET DP106642.jpg|German armchair; circa 1750\u20131760; carved and gilded beech, covered in blue damask not original to the armchair; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\n\nSk\u00e5p i stora salongen.

Furniture is also used to hold objects at a convenient height for work (as horizontal surfaces above the ground, such as tables and [[desk]]s), or to store things (e.g., [[cupboard]]s and [[Shelf (storage)|shelves]]). Furniture can be a product of design and is considered a form of [[decorative art]]. In addition to furniture's functional role, it can serve a symbolic or religious purpose. It can be made from many materials, including metal, plastic, and wood. Furniture can be made using a variety of [[woodworking joints]] which often reflect the local culture.\n\nPeople have been using natural objects, such as tree stumps, rocks and moss, as furniture since the beginning of human civilisation. Archaeological research shows that from around 30,000 years ago, people began constructing and carving their own furniture, using wood, stone, and animal bones. Early furniture from this period is known from artwork such as a [[Venus figurine]] found in [[Russia]], depicting the goddess on a throne. The first surviving extant furniture is in the homes of [[Skara Brae]] in [[Scotland]], and includes cupboards, dressers and beds all constructed from stone. Complex construction techniques such as [[joinery (woodworking)|joinery]] began in the [[Early Dynastic Period (Egypt)|early dynastic]] period of [[ancient Egypt]]. This era saw constructed wooden pieces, including [[stool (seat)|stools]] and tables, sometimes decorated with valuable metals or ivory. The evolution of furniture design continued in [[ancient Greece]] and [[ancient Rome]], with thrones being commonplace as well as the [[klinai]], multipurpose couches used for relaxing, eating, and sleeping. The furniture of the [[Middle Ages]] was usually heavy, [[oak]], and ornamented. Furniture design expanded during the Italian [[Renaissance]] of the fourteenth and fifteenth century. The seventeenth century, in both Southern and Northern Europe, was characterized by opulent, often gilded [[Baroque]] designs. The nineteenth century is usually defined by [[revival styles]]. The first three-quarters of the twentieth century are often seen as the march towards [[Modernism]]. One unique outgrowth of post-modern furniture design is a return to natural shapes and textures.<ref name=povo />\n\n==Etymology==\nThe [[English language|English]] word ''[[wikt:furniture|furniture]]'' is derived from the [[French language|French]] word ''[[wikt:fourniture|fourniture]]'',{{sfn|Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|2016}} the noun form of ''[[wikt:fournir|fournir]]'', which means to supply or provide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/french-english/fournir|title=English Translation of \"fournir\" \u2013 Collins French-English Dictionary|publisher=}}</ref> Thus ''fourniture'' in French means supplies or provisions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/french-english/fourniture|title=English Translation of \"fourniture\" \u2013 Collins French-English Dictionary|publisher=}}</ref> The English usage, referring specifically to household objects, is specific to that language;{{sfn|Weekley|2013|pp=609\u2013610}} French and other Romance languages as well as German use variants of the word ''[[wikt:meubles|meubles]]'', which derives from Latin ''[[wikt:mobilia|mobilia]]'', meaning \"moveable goods\".{{sfn|Solodow|2010|p=146}}\n\n==History==\n===Prehistoric furniture===\n[[File:Museum of Anatolian Civilizations 1320259 nevit.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Seated Woman of \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck]] statue is evidence that furniture existed in the [[neolithic]]]]\nThe practice of using natural objects as rudimentary pieces of furniture likely dates to the beginning of human civilisation.{{sfn|Smardzewski|2015|p=4}} Early humans are likely to have used tree stumps as seats, rocks as rudimentary tables, and mossy areas for sleeping.{{sfn|Smardzewski|2015|p=4}} During the late [[palaeolithic]] or early [[neolithic]] period, from around 30,000 years ago, people began constructing and carving their own furniture, using wood, stone and animal bones.{{sfn|Smardzewski|2015|p=1}} The earliest evidence for the existence of constructed furniture is a [[Venus figurine]] found at the [[Gagarino]] site in [[Russia]], which depicts the goddess in a sitting position, on a throne.{{sfn|Smardzewski|2015|p=2}} A similar [[Seated Woman of \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck|statue of a Mother Goddess]] was found in [[Catal Huyuk]] in [[Turkey]], dating to between 6000 and 5500 BCE.{{sfn|Smardzewski|2015|p=4}} The inclusion of such a seat in the figurines implies that these were already common artefacts of that age.{{sfn|Smardzewski|2015|p=2}}\n\n[[File:Skara Brae house 1 5.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Skara Brae]] house home furnishings, a dresser with shelves]]\nA range of unique stone furniture has been excavated in [[Skara Brae]], a [[Neolithic]] village in [[Orkney]], [[Scotland]]. The site dates from 3100\u20132500 BCE and due to a shortage of wood in Orkney, the people of Skara Brae were forced to build with stone, a readily available material that could be worked easily and turned into items for use within the household. Each [[house]] shows a high degree of sophistication and was equipped with an extensive assortment of stone furniture, ranging from cupboards, dressers and beds to shelves, stone seats, and [[limpet]] tanks. The stone dresser was regarded as the most important as it symbolically faces the entrance in each house and is therefore the first item seen when entering, perhaps displaying symbolic objects, including decorative artwork such as several Neolithic [[Carved Stone Balls]] also found at the site.\n\n[[Ancient Furniture|Ancient furniture]] has been excavated from the 8th-century BCE [[Phrygians|Phrygian]] [[tumulus]], the Midas Mound, in [[Gordion Furniture and Wooden Artifacts|Gordion]], [[Turkey]]. Pieces found here include [[table (furniture)|tables]] and inlaid serving stands. There are also surviving works from the 9th-8th-century BCE [[Assyria]]n palace of [[Nimrud]].

''Egypt, Canaan, and Israel in Ancient Times.'' (Princeton: University Press, 1992), p. 6.</ref>  At this period, Egyptians in the southwestern corner of Egypt were herding cattle and also constructing large buildings. [[Mortar (masonry)|Mortar]] was in use by around 4000 BCE The inhabitants of the Nile Valley and delta were self-sufficient and were raising barley and [[emmer]] (an early variety of wheat) and stored it in pits lined with reed mats.<ref name=\"Carl Roebuck p. 52\">Carl Roebuck, ''The World of Ancient Times'', p. 52.</ref>  They raised cattle, goats and pigs and they wove linens and baskets.<ref name=\"Carl Roebuck p. 52\"/> Evidence of furniture from the [[Predynastic Egypt|predynastic period]] is scarce, but samples from [[First Dynasty of Egypt|First Dynasty]] tombs indicate an already advanced use of furnishings in the houses of the age.{{sfn|Metropolitan Museum of Art|1999|p=117}}\n\nDuring the [[Early Dynastic Period (Egypt)|dynastic period]], which began in around 3200 BCE, Egyptian art developed significantly, and this included furniture design.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=1}} Egyptian furniture was primarily constructed using wood, but other materials were sometimes used, such as [[leather]],{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=14}} and pieces were often adorned with gold, silver, ivory and ebony, for decoration.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=14}} Wood found in Egypt was not suitable for furniture construction, so it had to be imported into the country from other places,{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=1}} particularly [[Phoenicia]].{{sfn|Gadalla|2007|p=243}} The scarcity of wood necessitated innovation in construction techniques. The use of [[scarf joint]]s to join two shorter pieces together and form a longer beam was one example of this,{{sfn|Smardzewski|2015|pp=13\u201314}} as well as construction of [[Wood veneer|veneers]] in which low quality cheap wood was used as the main building material, with a thin layer of expensive wood on the surface.{{sfn|Smardzewski|2015|p=14}}\n\nThe earliest used seating furniture in the dynastic period was the [[stool (seat)|stool]], which was used throughout Egyptian society, from the royal family down to ordinary citizens.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=15}} Various different designs were used, including stools with four vertical legs, and others with crossed splayed legs; almost all had rectangular seats, however.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=15}} Examples include the workman's stool, a simple three legged structure with a concave seat, designed for comfort during labour,{{sfn|Litchfield|2011|p=6}} and the much more ornate folding stool, with crossed folding legs,{{sfn|Litchfield|2011|pp=6\u20137}} which were decorated with carved duck heads and ivory,{{sfn|Litchfield|2011|pp=6\u20137}} and had hinges made of [[bronze]].{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=15}} Full [[chair]]s were much rarer in early Egypt, being limited to only wealthy and high ranking people, and seen as a status symbol; they did not reach ordinary households until the [[eighteenth dynasty]].{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=17}} Early examples were formed by adding a straight back to a stool, while later chairs had an inclined back.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=17}} Other furniture types in ancient Egypt include tables, which are heavily represented in art, but almost nonexistent as preserved items \u2013 perhaps because they were placed outside tombs rather than within,{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=21}} as well as beds and storage chests.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=22}}{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=24}}\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nStool with woven seat MET 14.10.3 view 4.jpg|Stool with woven seat; 1991\u20131450 BC; wood & reed; height: 13&nbsp;cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nJewelry chest of Sithathoryunet MET DP330328.jpg|Jewelry chest of Sithathoryunet; 1887\u20131813 BC; ebony, ivory, gold, carnelian, blue faience and silver; height: 36.7 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nEgyptian Museum 000 (37).jpg|The ''Throne of [[Tutankhamun]]''; 1336\u20131327 BC; wood covered with sheets of gold, silver, [[semi-precious stone|semi-precious]] and other stones, faience, glass and bronze; height: 1&nbsp;m; [[Egyptian Museum]] (Cairo)\n\nHatnefer's Chair MET 21M CAT047R4 (cropped).jpg|Chair of [[Hatnefer]]; 1492\u20131473&nbsp;BC; boxwood, cypress, ebony & linen cord; height: 53&nbsp;cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n</gallery>\n\n===Ancient Greece===\n[[File:Three illustrations of ancient Greek chairs, each being notated with a letter. a, b-klismos, and c-chair.jpg|thumb|225px|Three illustrations of ancient Greek chairs, each being notated with a letter: a, b-klismos, and c-chair]]\nHistorical knowledge of Greek furniture is derived from various sources, including [[Greek literature|literature]], [[terracotta]], sculptures, statuettes, and painted vases.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=39}} Some pieces survive to this day, primarily those constructed from metals, including bronze, or marble.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=39}} Wood was an important material in Greek furniture, both domestic and imported.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=39}} A common technique was to construct the main sections of the furniture with cheap solid wood, then apply a veneer using an expensive wood, such as maple or ebony.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=39}} Greek furniture construction also made use of [[dowels]] and [[Mortise and tenon|tenons]] for joining the wooden parts of a piece together.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=39}} Wood was shaped by carving, steam treatment, and the lathe, and furniture is known to have been decorated with ivory, tortoise shell, glass, gold or other precious materials.<ref>Richter, 125.</ref>\n\nThe modern word \u201c[[throne]]\u201d is derived from the ancient Greek ''thronos'' (Greek singular: \u03b8\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2), which was a seat designated for deities or individuals of high status or honor.<ref>Richter, 13.</ref> The colossal chryselephantine statue of [[Statue of Zeus at Olympia|Zeus at Olympia]], constructed by [[Phidias]] and lost in antiquity, featured the god Zeus seated on an elaborate throne, which was decorated with gold, precious stones, ebony and ivory, according to [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]].<ref>Richter, 14; NH 5.11.2ff.</ref> Other Greek seats included the ''[[klismos]]'', an elegant Greek chair with a curved backrest and legs whose form was copied by the Romans and is now part of the vocabulary of furniture design,<ref>Linda Maria Gigante, \u201cFunerary Art,\u201d in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome'', Vol. 1, ed.

Rome gradually superseded Greece as the foremost culture of Europe, leading eventually to Greece becoming a province of Rome in 146 BC. Rome thus took over production and distribution of Greek furniture, and the boundary between the two is blurred. The Romans did have some limited innovation outside of Greek influence, and styles distinctly their own.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=61}}\n\nRoman furniture was constructed principally using wood, metal and stone, with marble and limestone used for outside furniture. Very little wooden furniture survives intact, but there is evidence that a variety of woods were used, including maple, citron, beech, oak, and holly. Some imported wood such as satinwood was used for decoration. The most commonly used metal was bronze, of which numerous examples have survived, for example, headrests for couches and metal stools. Similar to the Greeks, [[Demography of the Roman Empire|Romans]] used tenons, dowels, nails, and glue to join wooden pieces together, and also practised veneering.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=61}}\n\nThe 1738 and 1748 excavations of [[Herculaneum]] and [[Pompeii]] revealed Roman furniture, preserved in the ashes of the AD 79 [[Eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79|eruption of Vesuvius]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nHandbook of ornament; a grammar of art, industrial and architectural designing in all its branches, for practical as well as theoretical use (1900) (14804265373).jpg|Illustration of Roman furniture details, from 1900, very similar with [[Empire style]] furniture\nClevelandart 1995.10.jpg|Tripod base; circa 100 BC; bronze; overall: 77 x 32.3 x 28&nbsp;cm; [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] ([[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], USA)\nForziere con sacrificio a giove, I secolo dc, legno, ferro e bronzo, con ageminature, dalla casa di trittolemo a pompei (napoli, man) 01.jpg|Treasure chest with a sacrifice of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] depicted on it; 1st century AD; wood, iron and bronze, with ageminature; from [[Pompeii]]; [[National Archaeological Museum, Naples|Naples National Archaeological Museum]] ([[Naples]], Italy)\nCouch and footstool with bone carvings and glass inlays MET DP138722.jpg|Couch and footstool with bone carvings and glass inlays; 1st\u20132nd century AD; wood, bone and glass; couch: 105.4 \u00d7 76.2 \u00d7 214.6&nbsp;cm; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\n</gallery>\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Medieval and Renaissance Europe===\n[[File:Cassone (one of a pair) MET DP106698.jpg|thumb|Renaissance [[cassone]]; circa 1550-1560; carved and partially gilded walnut; 86.4 x 181.9 x 67.3 cm; from [[Rome]]; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)]]\nIn contrast to the ancient civilisations of Egypt, Greece, and Rome, there is comparatively little evidence of furniture from the 5th to the 15th century.{{sfn|Lucie-Smith|1979|p=33}} Very few extant pieces survive, and evidence in literature is also scarce.{{sfn|Lucie-Smith|1979|p=33}} It is likely that the style of furniture prevalent in late antiquity persisted throughout the [[middle ages]].{{sfn|Lucie-Smith|1979|p=33}} For example, a throne similar to that of [[Zeus]] is depicted in a sixth-century [[diptych]],{{sfn|Lucie-Smith|1979|p=33}} while the [[Bayeux tapestry]] shows [[Edward the Confessor]] and [[Harold Godwinson|Harold]] seated on seats similar to the Roman [[sella curulis]].{{sfn|Lucie-Smith|1979|p=35}}\n\nThe furniture of the [[Middle Ages]] was usually heavy, [[oak]], and ornamented with carved designs. Along with the other arts, the Italian [[Renaissance]] of the fourteenth and fifteenth century marked a rebirth in design, often inspired by the [[Greco-Roman]] tradition. A similar explosion of design, and renaissance of culture in general occurred in Northern Europe, starting in the fifteenth century. The seventeenth century, in both Southern and Northern Europe, was characterized by opulent, often gilded [[Baroque]] designs that frequently incorporated a profusion of vegetal and scrolling ornament. Starting in the eighteenth century, furniture designs began to develop more rapidly. Although there were some styles that belonged primarily to one nation, such as [[Palladianism]] in [[Great Britain]] or [[Louis Quinze]] in [[French furniture]], others, such as the [[Rococo]] and [[Neoclassicism]] were perpetuated throughout Western Europe.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nCoffret (Minnek\u00e4stchen) MET DP273975.jpg|[[Gothic art|Gothic]] German coffret (Minnek\u00e4stchen); circa 1325-1350; oak, inlay, tempera, wrought-iron mounts; overall: 12.1 x 27.3 x 16.5; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\n\nPaschal Candlestick MET DP102923.jpg|Gothic Spanish paschal candlestick; circa 1450-1500; wood with paint and gilding; 195.6 \u00d7 43.8 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nCassone (chest), pair with 1975.1.1947 MET SLP1940-1.jpg|[[Renaissance]] cassone (chest); mid 16th century; walnut, carved and partially gilded, coniferous wood; height: 73.6 cm, width: 1.7 m, depth: 63.5 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nDresser (Dressoir aux harpies) MET DP105799.jpg|French Renaissance dresser (dressoir aux harpies); circa 1570-1590; carved walnut with interior elements of oak, pine, and some iron accessories; height: 144.8 cm, width: 137.8 cm, depth: 50.8 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n</gallery>\n\n===17th and 18th centuries===\nDuring the eighteenth century, the fashion was set in England by the French art. In the beginning of the century [[Boulle]] cabinets were at the peak of their popularity and [[Louis XIV]] was reigning in France. In this era, most of the furniture had metal and enamelled decorations in it and some of the furniture was covered in inlays of marbles lapis lazuli, and porphyry and other stones. By mid-century this [[Baroque]] style was displaced by the graceful curves, shining [[ormolu]], and intricate [[marquetry]] of the [[Rococo]] style, which in turn gave way around 1770 to the more severe lines of [[Neoclassicism]], modeled after the architecture of ancient Greece and Rome.\n<ref name=\"A history of feminine fashion\">{{cite book|author1=unknown|title=A history of feminine fashion|publisher=Nabu Pres|isbn= 978-1-289-62694-5|page=71}}</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nOlanda, guardaroba (kast), 1625-50 ca.jpg|Dutch wardrobe; 1625-1650; oak with ebony and rosewood veneers; overall: 244.5 x 224.3 x 85.2 cm; [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] ([[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], US)\n\nClevelandart 1968.31.jpg|Console table depicting [[Chronos]], or the father time; 1695; painted and gilded wood, with marble at its top; overall: 95.3 x 107.3 x 62.9 cm; Cleveland Museum of Art\n\nGermany, Mainz, 18th century - Gaming Table - 1953.284 - Cleveland Museum of Art.tif|Gaming Table; circa 1735; wood and ivory marquetry; overall: 78.7 x 94 x 54.6 cm; from [[Mainz]] (Germany); Cleveland Museum of Art\n\nCommode by Gilles Joubert, France, c. 1735, oak and walnut, veneered with tulipwood, ebony, holly, other woods, gilt bronze, imitation marble - Museum of Fine Arts, Boston - 20180922 164303.jpg|French commode; by [[Gilles Joubert]]; circa 1735; oak and walnut, veneered with tulipwood, ebony, holly, other woods, gilt bronze and imitation marble; [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Museum of Fine Arts]] ([[Boston]], USA)\n\nCommode MET DP105695.jpg|Parisian commode; 1745-1749; pine and oak veneered with amaranth and bois satin\u00e9, walnut, gilt-bronze mounts, and portoro marble top; 87.6 x 139.7 x 57.8 cm; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\n\nArmchair (fauteuil \u00e0 la reine) (part of a set) MET DP105705.jpg|Armchair (fauteuil \u00e0 la reine); circa 1754-1756; carved and gilded beech, wool and silk tapestry; overall: 103.8 \u00d7 73.7 \u00d7 66 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nJean pierre latz, commode, 1745-50 ca, con terracotta di un seguace di clodion.jpg|Rococo chest of drawers; circa 1750; oak, tulipwood marquetry, gilt metal mounts and marble; overall: 88 x 156.5 x 69.9 cm; Cleveland Museum of Art\n\nArmchair (fauteuil \u00e0 la reine) MET DP106642.jpg|German armchair; circa 1750\u20131760; carved and gilded beech, covered in blue damask not original to the armchair; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\n\nSk\u00e5p i stora salongen.

The aim of the college was to allow girls the same access to educational facilities as boys. The largest building on campus had been named \"Oakburn\" upon its construction 25 years earlier. After its first year, it had 88 students. The first [[Headmaster]] was G. Thornton-Lewis.<ref name=\"History\">{{cite web|url=http://www.soc.tas.edu.au/About/History.doc|title=Scotch Oakburn College History|work=The History|publisher=Scotch Oakburn College|format=doc|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928204458/http://www.soc.tas.edu.au/About/History.doc <!-- Bot retrieved archive -->|archivedate=2007-09-28|accessdate=2007-12-17}}</ref>\n\nIn 1969, M.L.C was renamed \"Oakburn College\" as the school council felt that 'Ladies' was outdated. The school became co&ndash;educational in 1973.<ref name=\"History\" />\n\n===Scotch College===\nThe Scotch College was established as a [[non-denominational]] boys' school, on York Street in the Launceston CBD in 1901. The school went through a number of owners in its first 50 years of existence, eventually being taken over by the [[Presbyterian Church of Australia]] in October 1950. In 1917, it moved from its York Street residence to the \"Ravenscraig\" property on Penquite Road, Newstead, around 10&nbsp;km east of the city.<ref name=\"History\" />\n\nBy 1972 the College was struggling to survive and it was subsequently decided to introduce co&ndash;education.<ref name=\"History\" />\n\n===Church union and amalgamation===\nAfter the formation of the [[Uniting Church in Australia]] in 1977, representatives from both colleges joined to discuss an [[Consolidation (business)|amalgamation]]. The successful amalgamation process was chaired by local [[physician]] John Morris, AO, MBE, who was then Chairman of the Oakburn College Council. 1979 was the inaugural year of Scotch Oakburn College with the Oakburn College Council Chairman becoming the Chairman of the amalgamated college's Council, and the Principal of Scotch College becoming the inaugural Principal of the amalgamated College.\n\nThe former Oakburn College campus, on Elphin Road, in 1979 became home to the Matriculation classes (years 11 and 12) and the [[junior school]] (years K\u20135) and boarding house. The same year, the Scotch College campus on Penquite Road became the [[middle school]] (years 6 to 10). In 1980, the current set-up was adopted with years 11 and 12 joining the middle school classes at the Penquite Campus, leaving the Elphin Campus with Early Learning to Year 5 and the boarding house.\n\nIt now operates in association with the [[Uniting Church in Australia]] but is not governed or managed by the Church.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://victas.uca.org.au/community-learning/uniting-church-schools/|title=Associated Schools|website=Uniting Church in Australia.

The campus features a number of beautiful old oak trees which are located at the front of the campus in a garden area.  The Elphin Campus is home to the Junior School / [[primary school]] (Early Learning to Year 5) and [[boarding house]]. The first building on the land was \"Oakburn\", constructed by Eliza Thomson in 1861, a year after she was granted the land. This is the most historic building on any of the campuses. In time, \"Oakburn\" would become the boarding house. The college was later renamed for this building. An extension to this building, the Mary Fox Jubilee Wing, was constructed in 1935 to celebrate the College's jubilee anniversary. Today it is better known to students as the Mary Fox Hall or just the Mary Fox{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} and it houses school assemblies, chapel services and many other events such as school plays, dances and trivia nights.\n\nThe stately \"Lemana\" and \"The Stables\" are located on the western end of the campus. \"The Stables\", as the name suggests, was formerly the [[stable]] area for horses. Lemana is a grand old house which keeps its historic exterior. The Mary Fox Performing Arts Centre is a dual-purpose space and is the centre of many school community events.\n\nThe Early Learning centre is home to [[pre-school]], [[kindergarten]], and after-hours care facilities. The centre was built on the site of the original Methodist Ladies' College/Oakburn College Principal's residence.\n\nThe Elphin campus also is home to four tennis courts, a large oval, two multi-purpose courts, a gymnasium and a 25m swimming pool.\n\n===Penquite===\nThe Penquite Campus is situated on both sides of Penquite Road in Newstead, linked by an underpass.  The main side of the campus or Eastern side features a large, rectangular, grassy field in the centre, with buildings located around the outside of it.  The major buildings of the school are named after and in honor of significant people and places in the school's heritage.  Over the years these buildings have been upgraded and redeveloped and more buildings have been built. Directly inside the main entrance to the College lies a large, old oak tree which lies beside the school Chapel. \n*\"Ravenscraig\", named after the original name of the Penquite Road property, refers to the oldest classroom block on the campus.  Formerly housing senior staff and administrative offices, this area now houses learning spaces.\n*Briggs House is located on the eastern end of the campus.  First constructed in 1954, this building was for boarding students of Scotch College. It is named for long serving headmaster W.V.V. Briggs. Upon amalgamation, the building began to be used for [[social sciences]] classrooms, and the kitchen area became the [[food technology]] area. Today the kitchen continues to be used for classes and the remainder of the building houses staff. \n*The Robert Dean Senior Student Centre (formally known as the Robert Dean Centre, or just Dean Centre to students, was the campus gymnasium; it featured one multi-purpose sports court with a gym/weights area on an upstairs mezzanine floor.  The Robert Dean Centre also housed school assemblies weekly) is one of the campus' largest buildings.  Named after former Scotch College Headmaster, Robert Dean, this building was redeveloped and reopened in March 2007, as a state of the art purpose-built study centre for Year 11 and Year 12 Tasmanian Certificate of Education students, including study areas, computing laboratories, learning spaces, a fully functioning student kitchen and relaxation area. Housed beneath are the Design and Technology, and Art departments. It is visible in the centre of the campus behind the field and between the John Morris Library and Bruce Carter Administration building.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n*Saint Andrews, named after the patron [[saint]] of [[Scotland]], is located on the western side of the campus. The building was refurbished internally in 2017 with the construction of the adjoining Helix building. The [[tuckshop]] is located in this area which provides a variety of healthy food options for students at both recess and lunch times.\n*Helix was opened in 2017 and is the Centre for Science and Mathematics and home for Years 9 and 10, on the Penquite Campus. This latest development continues the prudent investment by the College over the past decade to ensure it can provide contemporary learning spaces to complement our C21 Teaching and Learning. Helix houses four science laboratories and five new rooms.\n*The Health and Physical Education Centre opened in August 2007 features international standard basketball, netball, badminton and volleyball courts, two multi-purpose learning studios, and a weights and ergonomics room.\n\nThe Penquite Campus has seen a lot of building development since amalgamation: \n*The John Morris Centre (formerly the John Morris [[Library]]), named after the inaugural Chairman of the amalgamated College Council (now the Board of Management) was constructed in the late 1980s and refurbished in 2015.\n*The Bruce Carter Administration Building, named after the inaugural Principal of the amalgamated College, replaced the former administration facilities in Ravenscraig in the early 1990s.\n*The Horton Auditorium/Performing Arts Centre, opened in 2003, which includes an [[auditorium]] and [[performing arts]] facilities. The auditorium is named after the nineteenth century boys' school, [[Horton College]], near Ross in the Tasmanian Midlands, which was the first Methodist College in Australia.\n*The Middle School, which is situated on the opposite side of Penquite Road to the main campus (next to the Heath and Physical Education Centre), opened in early 2009 and features new facilities for students in grades 6 to 8. This side of the campus is connected via a tunnel which extends to the main Penquite facilities.\n*Helix, the Centre for Science and Mathematics and home to Year 9 and 10 students, opened in 2017.\n\n===Valley===\nIn 2005, Scotch Oakburn came to an arrangement with the owner of 'Rostrevor', near [[Fingal, Tasmania|Fingal]], to lease and use a part the property for [[outdoor education]] and environmental study purposes. This facility is known as the Valley Campus. The Valley Campus is home to the College Education Outdoors and Sustainability program.\n\n==House system==\nAt the Scotch Oakburn Junior School there are three Houses which students are allocated to in Year 2, they are: Thistle (blue), Willow (maroon) and Oak (yellow).  Throughout the year all students compete in a swimming carnival, cross country carnival and athletics carnival gaining points for their house.\n\nThe Scotch Oakburn Middle School and Senior School operates under four Houses: Fox (red), Dean (blue), Briggs (green) and Nance (yellow). Throughout the year students compete in a number of competitions to gain points to win the House Shield at the end of the year; these competitions include swimming, cross-country, athletics, debating and singing.\n\n==Notable alumni==\nAlumni of the Scotch Oakburn College (and its predecessors) are known as Old Collegians, and may elect to join the schools [[alumni association]], the Scotch Oakburn Old Collegians Association (SOOCA).<ref name=\"History2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.soc.tas.edu.au/Community/oldcollegians.htm |title=Old Collegians |accessdate=2007-08-22 |year =2007 |work=Scotch Oakburn College |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070625070105/http://www.soc.tas.edu.au/Community/oldcollegians.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-06-25}}</ref> Some notable Old Collegians include:\n\n;Academic\n* [[Alan Stretton]] - academic and Rhodes Scholar\n\n;Business\n* Sir [[Edgar Coles]] - former Managing Director of [[Coles Supermarkets]]\n\n;Entertainment, media and the arts \n* [[Stuart Coupe]] - music journalist, author, band manager, promoter, publicist, broadcaster and music label founder. \n* [[Roger Scholes]] - film director \n\n;Government, politics and the law\n* [[David Bushby]] - Senator for Tasmania\n* [[Enid Campbell]] [[Order of Australia|AO]], [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] - legal scholar, first Australian female professor and law school dean \n* [[Evelyn Temple Emmett]] OBE - first Director of the Tasmanian Government Tourist Bureau\n* [[John Watson (Australian politician)|John Watson]] - former Senator for Tasmania\n* [[Don Wing]] - former lawyer, politician and President of the [[Tasmanian Legislative Council]] \n* [[James Wise (diplomat)|James Wise]] - Australian High Commissioner to Malaysia and Ambassador to Thailand\n\n;Military\n* [[Alec Campbell]] - Australia's last [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps|ANZAC]] soldier<ref name=TheHistory>{{cite web |url=http://www.soc.tas.edu.au/About/history.htm |title=The History |accessdate=2007-08-22 |year =2007 |work=Scotch Oakburn College |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070819113441/http://www.soc.tas.edu.au/About/history.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-08-19}}</ref>\n\n;Sport\n* [[Marcos Ambrose]] - [[V8 Supercar]] champion;

The aim of the college was to allow girls the same access to educational facilities as boys. The largest building on campus had been named \"Oakburn\" upon its construction 25 years earlier. After its first year, it had 88 students. The first [[Headmaster]] was G. Thornton-Lewis.<ref name=\"History\">{{cite web|url=http://www.soc.tas.edu.au/About/History.doc|title=Scotch Oakburn College History|work=The History|publisher=Scotch Oakburn College|format=doc|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928204458/http://www.soc.tas.edu.au/About/History.doc <!-- Bot retrieved archive -->|archivedate=2007-09-28|accessdate=2007-12-17}}</ref>\n\nIn 1969, M.L.C was renamed \"Oakburn College\" as the school council felt that 'Ladies' was outdated. The school became co&ndash;educational in 1973.<ref name=History/>\n\n===Scotch College===\nThe Scotch College was established as a [[non-denominational]] boys' school, on York Street in the Launceston CBD in 1901. The school went through a number of owners in its first 50 years of existence, eventually being taken over by the [[Presbyterian Church of Australia]] in October 1950. In 1917, it moved from its York Street residence to the \"Ravenscraig\" property on Penquite Road, Newstead, around 10&nbsp;km east of the city.<ref name=History/>\n\nBy 1972 the College was struggling to survive and it was subsequently decided to introduce co&ndash;education.<ref name=History/>\n\n===Church union and amalgamation===\nAfter the formation of the [[Uniting Church in Australia]] in 1977, representatives from both colleges joined to discuss an [[Consolidation (business)|amalgamation]]. The successful amalgamation process was chaired by local [[physician]] John Morris, AO, MBE, who was then Chairman of the Oakburn College Council. 1979 was the inaugural year of Scotch Oakburn College with the Oakburn College Council Chairman becoming the Chairman of the amalgamated college's Council, and the Principal of Scotch College becoming the inaugural Principal of the amalgamated College.\n\nThe former Oakburn College campus, on Elphin Road, in 1979 became home to the Matriculation classes (years 11 and 12) and the [[junior school]] (years K\u20135) and boarding house. The same year, the Scotch College campus on Penquite Road became the [[middle school]] (years 6 to 10). In 1980, the current set-up was adopted with years 11 and 12 joining the middle school classes at the Penquite Campus, leaving the Elphin Campus with Early Learning to Year 5 and the boarding house.\n\nIt now operates in association with the [[Uniting Church in Australia]] but is not governed or managed by the Church.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://victas.uca.org.au/community-learning/uniting-church-schools/|title=Associated Schools|website=Uniting Church in Australia.

Helix houses four science laboratories and five new rooms.\n*The Health and Physical Education Centre opened in August 2007 features international standard basketball, netball, badminton and volleyball courts, two multi-purpose learning studios, and a weights and ergonomics room.\n\nThe Penquite Campus has seen a lot of building development since amalgamation: \n*The John Morris Centre (formerly the John Morris [[Library]]), named after the inaugural Chairman of the amalgamated College Council (now the Board of Management) was constructed in the late 1980s and refurbished in 2015.\n*The Bruce Carter Administration Building, named after the inaugural Principal of the amalgamated College, replaced the former administration facilities in Ravenscraig in the early 1990s.\n*The Horton Auditorium/Performing Arts Centre, opened in 2003, which includes an [[auditorium]] and [[performing arts]] facilities. The auditorium is named after the nineteenth century boys' school, [[Horton College]], near Ross in the Tasmanian Midlands, which was the first Methodist College in Australia.\n*The Middle School, which is situated on the opposite side of Penquite Road to the main campus (next to the Heath and Physical Education Centre), opened in early 2009 and features new facilities for students in grades 6 to 8. This side of the campus is connected via a tunnel which extends to the main Penquite facilities.\n*Helix, the Centre for Science and Mathematics and home to Year 9 and 10 students, opened in 2017.\n\n===Valley===\nIn 2005, Scotch Oakburn came to an arrangement with the owner of 'Rostrevor', near [[Fingal, Tasmania|Fingal]], to lease and use a part the property for [[outdoor education]] and environmental study purposes. This facility is known as the Valley Campus. The Valley Campus is home to the College Education Outdoors and Sustainability program.\n\n==House system==\nAt the Scotch Oakburn Junior School there are three Houses which students are allocated to in Year 2, they are: Thistle (blue), Willow (maroon) and Oak (yellow).  Throughout the year all students compete in a swimming carnival, cross country carnival and athletics carnival gaining points for their house.\n\nThe Scotch Oakburn Middle School and Senior School operates under four Houses: Fox (red), Dean (blue), Briggs (green) and Nance (yellow). Throughout the year students compete in a number of competitions to gain points to win the House Shield at the end of the year; these competitions include swimming, cross-country, athletics, debating and singing.\n\n==Notable alumni==\nAlumni of the Scotch Oakburn College (and its predecessors) are known as Old Collegians, and may elect to join the schools [[alumni association]], the Scotch Oakburn Old Collegians Association (SOOCA).<ref name=History>{{cite web |url=http://www.soc.tas.edu.au/Community/oldcollegians.htm |title=Old Collegians |accessdate=2007-08-22 |year =2007 |work=Scotch Oakburn College |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070625070105/http://www.soc.tas.edu.au/Community/oldcollegians.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-06-25}}</ref> Some notable Old Collegians include:\n\n;Academic\n* [[Alan Stretton]] - academic and Rhodes Scholar\n\n;Business\n* Sir [[Edgar Coles]] - former Managing Director of [[Coles Supermarkets]]\n\n;Entertainment, media and the arts \n* [[Stuart Coupe]] - music journalist, author, band manager, promoter, publicist, broadcaster and music label founder. \n* [[Roger Scholes]] - film director \n\n;Government, politics and the law\n* [[David Bushby]] - Senator for Tasmania\n* [[Enid Campbell]] [[Order of Australia|AO]], [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] - legal scholar, first Australian female professor and law school dean \n* [[Evelyn Temple Emmett]] OBE - first Director of the Tasmanian Government Tourist Bureau\n* [[John Watson (Australian politician)|John Watson]] - former Senator for Tasmania\n* [[Don Wing]] - former lawyer, politician and President of the [[Tasmanian Legislative Council]] \n* [[James Wise (diplomat)|James Wise]] - Australian High Commissioner to Malaysia and Ambassador to Thailand\n\n;Military\n* [[Alec Campbell]] - Australia's last [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps|ANZAC]] soldier<ref name=TheHistory>{{cite web |url=http://www.soc.tas.edu.au/About/history.htm |title=The History |accessdate=2007-08-22 |year =2007 |work=Scotch Oakburn College |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070819113441/http://www.soc.tas.edu.au/About/history.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-08-19}}</ref>\n\n;Sport\n* [[Marcos Ambrose]] - [[V8 Supercar]] champion; [[NASCAR]] Driver \n* [[Brent Crosswell]] - AFL footballer\n* [[Michael Grenda]] - Olympic Cycling Gold Medalist\n* [[Meg Phillips]] - WNCL and WBBL cricketer<ref>{{cite news|last1=Fair|first1=Alex|title=Phillips to play county cricket|url=http://www.examiner.com.au/story/2860128/phillips-to-play-county-cricket/|accessdate=4 June 2017|work=[[The Examiner (Tasmania)|The Examiner]]|date=3 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of schools in Tasmania]]\n*[[List of boarding schools]]\n* [[Education in Tasmania]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n{{UCA Schools}}\n{{Former PCA Schools}}\n{{SATIS Schools}}\n{{Member Schools of Round Square|state=autocollapse}}\n\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1979]]\n[[Category:Presbyterian schools in Australia]]\n[[Category:High schools in Tasmania]]\n[[Category:Former Methodist schools in Australia]]\n[[Category:Uniting Church schools in Australia]]\n[[Category:Boarding schools in Tasmania]]\n[[Category:Private primary schools in Tasmania]]\n[[Category:Private secondary schools in Tasmania]]\n[[Category:Rock Eisteddfod Challenge participants]]\n[[Category:Round Square schools]]\n[[Category:Junior School Heads Association of Australia Member Schools]]\n[[Category:1979 establishments in Australia]]\n", "name_user": "Quebec99", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fix duplicate ref names \u2013You can help!", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotch_Oakburn_College"}
