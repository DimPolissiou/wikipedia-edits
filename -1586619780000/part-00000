In addition to singing, he plays [[guitar]], [[fiddle]], [[mandolin]], [[banjo]], [[bouzouki]] and [[mandocello]]. He has released more than ten studio albums, in addition to charting a duet with [[Kathy Mattea]] entitled \"The Battle Hymn of Love\", a No.&nbsp;9 hit on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now [[Hot Country Songs]]) charts in 1990. In November 2013 he was inducted into the West Virginia Music Hall of Fame.\n\n== Early life ==\nTim O'Brien was born on March 16, 1954 and raised in [[Wheeling, West Virginia]], the youngest in a family of five children. At the age of 12, he first heard a [[Bob Dylan]] record, played by his older sister [[Mollie O'Brien|Mollie]], afterwards deciding to take up music.  Throughout his teens, he taught himself to play [[guitar]], [[fiddle|violin]], and [[mandolin]].\n\nIn high school, he and his sister Mollie, a singer, began performing [[Peter, Paul, and Mary]] songs as a duo at church and local coffeehouses.<ref name=\"bio\"/>\n\n== Music career ==\n\n=== Hot Rize ===\nIn 1973, he dropped out of [[Colby College]] to pursue music professionally.  He wrote to his mother at the time, saying, \"I'm heading west.  I know 200 songs now, and I figure if I keep learning more I should be all right.\"\n\nHe eventually moved to [[Boulder, Colorado]] in the 1970s and became part of the music scene there. In [[Colorado]], he met guitarist/bassist [[Charles Sawtelle]], banjoist [[Pete Wernick]], and guitarist Mike Scap, with whom he formed [[Hot Rize]] in 1978. Mike Scap was soon replaced by Nick Forster on bass with Sawtelle moving to guitar. Over the next twelve years, the quartet earned recognition as one of America's most innovative and entertaining bluegrass bands. Never straying too far from a traditional sound, Hot Rize stood out with fresh harmony singing, Wernick's melodic banjo playing, and O'Brien's easy-going rhythmic drive.\n\nTo broaden their repertoire, the members of Hot Rize would often split their show with a set of classic and offbeat country and western music in the comic guise of Red Knuckles and the Trailblazers.<ref name=\"Official Website\">{{cite web |url=http://www.timobrien.net/bio.cfm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 27, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313073415/http://www.timobrien.net/bio.cfm |archivedate=March 13, 2008 }} Official Website</ref> The band would walk off stage, change clothes, and reappear as a different band (O'Brien assumed the mantle of \"Red Knuckles\"), with its own songs, fictional back story and odd costumes.

He is a former [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]] international. Anyone sees sammy tell him to come home!\n\n==Club career==\nBorn in [[Ibadan]], [[Oyo State]], Odejayi started his career as a trainee at [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] and then moved on to [[Football Conference]] side [[Forest Green Rovers F.C.|Forest Green Rovers]] in 2002. [[2002-03 in English football|2002\u201303]] turned out to be Rovers' best ever season since their foundation in 1890, and Odejayi was a key figure, scoring 13 goals as the club finished ninth.\n\n===Cheltenham Town===\nThis brought him to the attention of Cheltenham Town, and then-manager Bobby Gould signed him that summer. His first two seasons were a struggle but in his third season [[2005-06 in English football|(2005\u201306)]] he played almost every game as Cheltenham stormed to the play-off final, winning 1\u20130 against fancied [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]]. He came to national attention in January 2006 when Cheltenham faced [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in the [[2005-06 FA Cup#Fourth Round|FA Cup]] 4th round. Odejayi was outstanding, giving French international defender [[Jean-Alain Boumsong]] no end of problems during the game. Following the game he was linked with a move to Championship team [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]] however the move never materialised.\n\n===Barnsley===\nOn 31 May 2007, Odejayi moved to [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] for a fee of \u00a3200,000, a Cheltenham record for a sale of a player. Forest Green Rovers received a windfall from the transfer as part of the terms of Odejayi's Cheltenham deal.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/barnsley/6684035.stm|title=\nTykes sign Cheltenham's Odejayi|accessdate=31 May 2007|date=31 May 2007|publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref>\n\nHe scored in the Reds' first friendly against [[Morecambe F.C.|Morecambe]] in a 2\u20131 defeat. He then bagged a brace against Portuguese side [[Louletano DC]] in a 3\u20132 win. In a 3\u20131 victory against [[Buxton F.C.|Buxton]] he bagged his fourth goal in three.\n\nOdejayi netted his first competitive goal for Barnsley against [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]] which effectively sealed a 2\u20130 victory for the Reds.\n\nOdejayi was booed off by his own fans against [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], after he missed a string of chances at goal. He himself admitted about his poor performances and promised the fans he would step it up and he did in the [[2007\u201308 FA Cup|FA Cup]], scoring of one of the most important goals in the club history when he secured a 1\u20130 victory at Oakwell, in the quarter finals of the FA Cup 2008 against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]. On 6 April 2008 in the [[FA Cup]] semi-final against [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] he missed an absolute sitter to score when he was put clean through on goal only to shoot wide, costing Barnsley the chance to equalise and possibly reach the FA Cup Final for the first time since [[1912 FA Cup Final|1912]].\n\nIn January 2009, there was talk of him being pursued by Barnsley's South Yorkshire neighbours, [[Rotherham United]]. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.rotherham.vitalfootball.co.uk/article.asp?a=143556| title= RUFC - Millers make cash offer for Odejayi?|accessdate=20 October 2015|date=13 February 2009|publisher=vitalfootball.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n====Scunthorpe United (loan)====\nOn 26 February he was loaned to [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe]]. He played in 6 games scoring 1 goal against Walsall.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_2/7908310.stm\n|title=Scunthorpe 1\u20131 Walsall\n|publisher=BBC |date=3 March 2009 |accessdate=1 January 2010}}</ref>\n\n====Colchester United (loan)====\nHe was loaned to [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]] on 16 September 2009 on a three-month emergency loan. He made a big impression at the [[Colchester Community Stadium|Weston Homes Community Stadium]], winning two penalties in his first game against [[Hartlepool United F.C.|Hartlepool United]] and then scoring a brace against high flying [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]]. He also went on to score against [[Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield Town]], [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]], [[Wycombe Wanderers F.C.|Wycombe Wanderers]], [[Bromley F.C.|Bromley]] and [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]].\n\nHe set up [[John-Joe O'Toole]]'s first Colchester goal in a 1\u20131 draw at [[Tranmere Rovers F.C.|Tranmere Rovers]], whilst Odejayi also assisted [[Simon Hackney]]'s goal against Bromley in the FA Cup. His loan spell ended on 19 December with him having scored seven goals in sixteen games, six of which came in the Football League. When the January transfer window opened, Odejayi's loan form resulted in him being signed by [[Aidy Boothroyd]] on a permanent deal, thus also becoming Aidy's first permanent signing for Colchester United.\n\n===Colchester United===\nOn 24 December 2009 it was announced that Odejayi had signed for an undisclosed fee on a deal that would end in June 2012.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cu-fc.com/page/News/0,,10424~1914655,00.html |title=Odejayi makes permanent move |accessdate=24 December 2007 |date=24 December 2007 |publisher=Colchester United F.C. |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910202627/http://www.cu-fc.com/page/News/0%2C%2C10424~1914655%2C00.html |archivedate=10 September 2012 }}</ref> Odejayi scored his first goal as a full-time [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester]] player in a 2\u20131 win against [[Carlisle United F.C.|Carlisle]] where he came off the bench to score the winner in stoppage time to keep the U's in their promotion hunt. He added two further goals against [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]] and [[Yeovil Town F.C.|Yeovil]] before getting an injury after coming on as a sub against [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]]. Odejayi was named as Colchester United's official player-of-the-season for the [[2011\u201312 Colchester United F.C. season|2011\u201312]] season, having led the front-line with power and strength all campaign.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.eadt.co.uk/sport/colchester-united/kayode_odejayi_scoops_main_award_1_1358837|title= Kayode Odejayi scoops main award|accessdate=24 April 2012|date=25 April 2012|publisher=EADT}}</ref>\n\n===Rotherham United===\nOn 15 May, [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]] completed the much-rumoured signing of Odejayi after talks with Steve Evans. He joined the Millers officially on 1 July. His first goal for the club came in the 3\u20130 win against Burton Albion on 18 August 2012, this was also the opening day of the New York Stadium, and, on his league debut for the club. His second came soon after to gain a point against Chesterfield, on 25 August 2012. However, only 5 goals all season grew to fans frustration as [[Alex Revell]] and [[Daniel Nardiello]] became the preferred striking partnership.\n\nOn 10 September 2013, Odejayi joined [[Football League Two|League Two]] side [[Accrington Stanley F.C.|Accrington Stanley]] on a three-month loan.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24037302 |title=Accrington Stanley:

He is a former [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]] international.\n\n==Club career==\nBorn in [[Ibadan]], [[Oyo State]], Odejayi started his career as a trainee at [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] and then moved on to [[Football Conference]] side [[Forest Green Rovers F.C.|Forest Green Rovers]] in 2002. [[2002-03 in English football|2002\u201303]] turned out to be Rovers' best ever season since their foundation in 1890, and Odejayi was a key figure, scoring 13 goals as the club finished ninth.\n\n===Cheltenham Town===\nThis brought him to the attention of Cheltenham Town, and then-manager Bobby Gould signed him that summer. His first two seasons were a struggle but in his third season [[2005-06 in English football|(2005\u201306)]] he played almost every game as Cheltenham stormed to the play-off final, winning 1\u20130 against fancied [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]]. He came to national attention in January 2006 when Cheltenham faced [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in the [[2005-06 FA Cup#Fourth Round|FA Cup]] 4th round. Odejayi was outstanding, giving French international defender [[Jean-Alain Boumsong]] no end of problems during the game. Following the game he was linked with a move to Championship team [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]] however the move never materialised.\n\n===Barnsley===\nOn 31 May 2007, Odejayi moved to [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] for a fee of \u00a3200,000, a Cheltenham record for a sale of a player. Forest Green Rovers received a windfall from the transfer as part of the terms of Odejayi's Cheltenham deal.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/barnsley/6684035.stm|title=\nTykes sign Cheltenham's Odejayi|accessdate=31 May 2007|date=31 May 2007|publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref>\n\nHe scored in the Reds' first friendly against [[Morecambe F.C.|Morecambe]] in a 2\u20131 defeat. He then bagged a brace against Portuguese side [[Louletano DC]] in a 3\u20132 win. In a 3\u20131 victory against [[Buxton F.C.|Buxton]] he bagged his fourth goal in three.\n\nOdejayi netted his first competitive goal for Barnsley against [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]] which effectively sealed a 2\u20130 victory for the Reds.\n\nOdejayi was booed off by his own fans against [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], after he missed a string of chances at goal. He himself admitted about his poor performances and promised the fans he would step it up and he did in the [[2007\u201308 FA Cup|FA Cup]], scoring of one of the most important goals in the club history when he secured a 1\u20130 victory at Oakwell, in the quarter finals of the FA Cup 2008 against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]. On 6 April 2008 in the [[FA Cup]] semi-final against [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] he missed an absolute sitter to score when he was put clean through on goal only to shoot wide, costing Barnsley the chance to equalise and possibly reach the FA Cup Final for the first time since [[1912 FA Cup Final|1912]].\n\nIn January 2009, there was talk of him being pursued by Barnsley's South Yorkshire neighbours, [[Rotherham United]]. <ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.rotherham.vitalfootball.co.uk/article.asp?a=143556| title= RUFC - Millers make cash offer for Odejayi?|accessdate=20 October 2015|date=13 February 2009|publisher=vitalfootball.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n====Scunthorpe United (loan)====\nOn 26 February he was loaned to [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe]]. He played in 6 games scoring 1 goal against Walsall.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_2/7908310.stm\n|title=Scunthorpe 1\u20131 Walsall\n|publisher=BBC |date=3 March 2009 |accessdate=1 January 2010}}</ref>\n\n====Colchester United (loan)====\nHe was loaned to [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]] on 16 September 2009 on a three-month emergency loan. He made a big impression at the [[Colchester Community Stadium|Weston Homes Community Stadium]], winning two penalties in his first game against [[Hartlepool United F.C.|Hartlepool United]] and then scoring a brace against high flying [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]]. He also went on to score against [[Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield Town]], [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]], [[Wycombe Wanderers F.C.|Wycombe Wanderers]], [[Bromley F.C.|Bromley]] and [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]].\n\nHe set up [[John-Joe O'Toole]]'s first Colchester goal in a 1\u20131 draw at [[Tranmere Rovers F.C.|Tranmere Rovers]], whilst Odejayi also assisted [[Simon Hackney]]'s goal against Bromley in the FA Cup. His loan spell ended on 19 December with him having scored seven goals in sixteen games, six of which came in the Football League. When the January transfer window opened, Odejayi's loan form resulted in him being signed by [[Aidy Boothroyd]] on a permanent deal, thus also becoming Aidy's first permanent signing for Colchester United.\n\n===Colchester United===\nOn 24 December 2009 it was announced that Odejayi had signed for an undisclosed fee on a deal that would end in June 2012.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cu-fc.com/page/News/0,,10424~1914655,00.html |title=Odejayi makes permanent move |accessdate=24 December 2007 |date=24 December 2007 |publisher=Colchester United F.C. |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910202627/http://www.cu-fc.com/page/News/0%2C%2C10424~1914655%2C00.html |archivedate=10 September 2012 }}</ref> Odejayi scored his first goal as a full-time [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester]] player in a 2\u20131 win against [[Carlisle United F.C.|Carlisle]] where he came off the bench to score the winner in stoppage time to keep the U's in their promotion hunt. He added two further goals against [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]] and [[Yeovil Town F.C.|Yeovil]] before getting an injury after coming on as a sub against [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]]. Odejayi was named as Colchester United's official player-of-the-season for the [[2011\u201312 Colchester United F.C. season|2011\u201312]] season, having led the front-line with power and strength all campaign.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.eadt.co.uk/sport/colchester-united/kayode_odejayi_scoops_main_award_1_1358837|title= Kayode Odejayi scoops main award|accessdate=24 April 2012|date=25 April 2012|publisher=EADT}}</ref>\n\n===Rotherham United===\nOn 15 May, [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]] completed the much-rumoured signing of Odejayi after talks with Steve Evans. He joined the Millers officially on 1 July. His first goal for the club came in the 3\u20130 win against Burton Albion on 18 August 2012, this was also the opening day of the New York Stadium, and, on his league debut for the club. His second came soon after to gain a point against Chesterfield, on 25 August 2012. However, only 5 goals all season grew to fans frustration as [[Alex Revell]] and [[Daniel Nardiello]] became the preferred striking partnership.\n\nOn 10 September 2013, Odejayi joined [[Football League Two|League Two]] side [[Accrington Stanley F.C.|Accrington Stanley]] on a three-month loan.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24037302 |title=Accrington Stanley:
