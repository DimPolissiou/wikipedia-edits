Colors are harmonized to achieve a balanced, unified, and aesthetically pleasing effect for the viewer.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nColor harmony is achieved in a variety of ways, some of which consist of combining a set of colors that share the same hue, or a set of colors that share the same values for two of the three color characteristics (hue, saturation, brightness).<ref name=\":1\" /> Color harmony can also be achieved by simply combining colors that are considered compatible to one another<ref name=\":1\" /> as represented in the [[color wheel]].\n\n*[[Contrast (vision)|'''Color contrasts''']]\n\n[[Contrast (vision)|Color contrasts]] are studied with a pair of colors, as opposed to color harmony, which studies a set of colors. In color contrasting, two colors with perceivable differences in aspects such as luminance, or saturation, are placed side by side to create contrast.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n[[Johannes Itten]] presented seven kinds of color contrasts: contrast of light and dark, contrast of hue, contrast of temperature, contrast of [[Colorfulness|saturation]], simultaneous contrast, contrast of sizes, and contrast of complementary.<ref name=\":1\" /> These seven kinds of color contrasts have inspired past works involving color schemes in design.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n*[[Color scheme|'''Color schemes''']]\n\n[[Color scheme]]s are defined as the set of colors chosen for a design. They are often made up of two or more colors that look appealing beside one another, and that create an [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] feeling when used together. Color schemes depend on [[Harmony (color)|color harmony]] as they point to which colors look pleasing beside one another.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nA satisfactory design product is often accompanied by a successful color scheme. Over time, color design tools with the function of generating color schemes were developed to facilitate color harmonizing for designers.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2006-06-01|title=Applying colour science in colour design|url=|journal=Optics & Laser Technology|language=en|volume=38|issue=4\u20136|pages=392\u2013398|doi=10.1016/j.optlastec.2005.06.025|issn=0030-3992|last1=Luo|first1=Ming Ronnier}}</ref>\n\n==== Use of color in visual design ====\n\n* Color is used to create harmony, balance, and visual comfort in a design<ref name=\":3\" />\n* Color is used to evoke the desired mood and emotion upon the viewer<ref name=\":0\" />\n* Color is used to create a [[Theme (arts)|theme]] in the design<ref name=\":1\" />\n* Color holds meaning and can be symbolic.

Lines can be vertical, horizontal, diagonal or curved. They can be any width or texture. And can be continuous, implied, or broken. On top of that, there are different types of line, aside from the ones previously mentioned. For example, you could have a line that is \nhorizontal and zigzagged or a line that is vertical and zigzagged. Different lines create different moods, it all depends on what mood you are using a line to create.\n\n=== Point ===\nA Point is basically the beginning of \u201csomething\u201d in \u201cnothing\u201d. It forces the mind to think upon its position and gives something to build upon in both imagination and space. Some abstract points in a group can provoke human imagination to link it with familiar shapes or forms\n\n===Shape===\n{{main|Shape and form (visual arts)}}\nA [[shape]] is defined as a two dimensional area that stands out from the space next to or around it due to a defined or implied boundary, or because of differences of value, color, or texture.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ehhs.kent.edu/community/VLO/design/elements/shape/index.html | title=Visual Literacy |author=Cindy Kovalik, Ph.D. and Peggy King, M.Ed. |accessdate=2010-03-27}}</ref> Shapes are recognizable objects and forms<ref name=\":0\" /> and are usually composed of other elements of design.<ref name=\"Design Notes\">{{cite web|last=Saw|first=James|title=Design Notes|url=http://daphne.palomar.edu/design/Default.htm|publisher=Palomar College|accessdate=3 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nFor example, a [[square]] that is drawn on a piece of paper is considered a shape. It is created with a series of lines which serve as a boundary that shapes the square and separates it from the space around it that is not part of the square.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n====Types of shapes====\n[[Geometric shape|'''Geometric shapes''']] or mechanical shapes are shapes that can be drawn using a ruler or compass, such as [[square]]s, [[circle]]s, [[triangle]]s, [[ellipse]]s, [[parallelogram]]s, [[Star polygon|stars]], and so on.<ref name=\":0\" /> Mechanical shapes, whether simple or complex, produce a feeling of control and order.<ref name=\"Design Notes\" />\n\n[[Organic form|'''Organic shapes''']] are irregular shapes<ref name=\":0\" /> that are often complex and resemble shapes that are found in [[nature]].<ref name=\"Design Notes\" /> Organic shapes can be drawn by hand, which is why they are sometimes subjective and only exist in the imagination of the artist.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n'''Curvilinear shapes''' are composed of curved lines and smooth edges. They give off a more natural feeling to the shape. In contrast, '''rectilinear shapes''' are composed of sharp edges and [[right angle]]s, and give off a sense of order in the [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]]. They look more human-made, structured, and [[Artificiality|artificial]]. Artists can choose to create a composition that revolves mainly around one of these styles of shape, or they can choose to combine both.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Texture===\n{{main|Texture (visual arts)}}\n[[File:Texture arbre.jpg|thumb|This is only a two dimensional image of a tree, but appears to have the texture of three dimensional bark.]]\n[[Texture (visual arts)|Texture]] refers to the physical and visual qualities of a surface.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n==== Uses of texture in design ====\n\n* Texture can be used to attract or repel interest to an element, depending on how pleasant the texture is perceived to be.<ref name=\"Design Notes\" /> \n* Texture can also be used to add complex detail into the [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]] of a design.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n* In theatrical design, the surface qualities of a costume sculpts the look and feel of a character, which influences the way the audience reacts to the character.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n;Types of texture\n\n'''Tactile texture''', also known as \"actual texture\", refers to the physical three-dimensional texture of an object. Tactile texture can be perceived by the sense of touch. A person can feel the tactile texture of a sculpture by running their hand over its surface and feelings its ridges and dents.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n* Painters use [[impasto]] to build peaks and create texture in their painting.<ref name=\"Design Notes\" />\n* Texture can be created through [[collage]]. This is when artists assemble three dimensional objects and apply them onto a two-dimensional surface, like a piece of paper or canvas, to create one final composition.<ref name=\":0\" />\n* [[Papier coll\u00e9]] is another collaging technique in which artists glue paper to a surface to create different textures on its surface.<ref name=\":0\" />\n* [[Assemblage (art)|Assemblage]] is a technique that consists of assembling various three-dimensional objects into a sculpture, which can also reveal textures to the viewer.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n'''Visual texture''', also referred to as \"implied texture\", is not detectable by our sense of touch, but by our sense of sight.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} Visual texture is the illusion of a real texture on a two-dimensional surface.<ref name=\":0\" /> Any texture perceived in an image or photograph is a visual texture. A photograph of rough tree bark is considered a visual texture. It creates the impression of a real texture on a two-dimensional surface which would remain smooth to the touch no matter how rough the represented texture is.<ref name=\"Design Notes\" />\n\nIn painting, different [[paint]]s are used to achieve different types of textures. Paints such as [[Oil paint|oil]], [[Acrylic paint|acrylic]], and [[Encaustic painting|encaustic]] are thicker and more [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] and are used to create three-dimensional impressions on the surface. Other paints, such as [[Watercolor painting|watercolor]], tend to be used for visual textures, because they are thinner and have transparency, and do not leave much tactile texture on the surface.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Pattern ====\nMany textures appear to repeat the same [[motif (visual arts)|motif]].<ref name=\":0\" /> When a motif is repeated over and over again in a surface, it results in a '''[[pattern]]'''.<ref name=\"Design Notes\" /> Patterns are frequently used in [[fashion design]] or [[textile design]], where motifs are repeated to create decorative patterns on fabric or other [[textile]] materials.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} Patterns are also used in [[Architecture|architectural design]], where decorative structural elements such as [[window]]s, [[column]]s, or [[pediment]]s, are incorporated into building design.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n===Space===\nIn design, space is concerned with the area deep within the moment of designated design, the design will take place on. For a two-dimensional design, space concerns creating the illusion of a third dimension on a flat surface:<ref name=\"Design Notes\" />\n\n*Overlap is the effect where objects appear to be on top of each other. This illusion makes the top element look closer to the observer. There is no way to determine the depth of the space, only the order of closeness.\n*Shading adds gradiation marks to make an object of a two-dimensional surface seem three-dimensional.\n*Highlight, Transitional Light, Core of the Shadow, Reflected Light, and Cast Shadow give an object a three-dimensional look.<ref name=\"Design Notes\" />\n*Linear Perspective is the concept relating to how an object seems smaller the farther away it gets.\n*Atmospheric Perspective is based on how air acts as a filter to change the appearance of distant objects.\n\n===Form===\nIn visual design, form is described as the way an artist arranges elements in the entirety of a composition.<ref name=\":0\" /> It may also be described as any [[three-dimensional]] object. Form can be measured, from top to bottom (height), side to side (width), and from back to front (depth). Form is also defined by light and dark. It can be defined by the presence of shadows on surfaces or faces of an object. There are two types of form, geometric (artificial) and natural (organic form). Form may be created by the combining of two or more shapes. It may be enhanced by tone, texture or color. It can be illustrated or constructed.\n\n==Principles of design==\n{{See also|Gestalt laws of grouping}}\nPrinciples applied to the '''elements of design''' that bring them together into one design.

Colors are harmonized to achieve a balanced, unified, and aesthetically pleasing effect for the viewer.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nColor harmony is achieved in a variety of ways, some of which consist of combining a set of colors that share the same hue, or a set of colors that share the same values for two of the three color characteristics (hue, saturation, brightness).<ref name=\":1\" /> Color harmony can also be achieved by simply combining colors that are considered compatible to one another<ref name=\":1\" /> as represented in the [[color wheel]].\n\n*[[Contrast (vision)|'''Color contrasts''']]\n\n[[Contrast (vision)|Color contrasts]] are studied with a pair of colors, as opposed to color harmony, which studies a set of colors. In color contrasting, two colors with perceivable differences in aspects such as luminance, or saturation, are placed side by side to create contrast.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n[[Johannes Itten]] presented seven kinds of color contrasts: contrast of light and dark, contrast of hue, contrast of temperature, contrast of [[Colorfulness|saturation]], simultaneous contrast, contrast of sizes, and contrast of complementary.<ref name=\":1\" /> These seven kinds of color contrasts have inspired past works involving color schemes in design.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n*[[Color scheme|'''Color schemes''']]\n\n[[Color scheme]]s are defined as the set of colors chosen for a design. They are often made up of two or more colors that look appealing beside one another, and that create an [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] feeling when used together. Color schemes depend on [[Harmony (color)|color harmony]] as they point to which colors look pleasing beside one another.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nA satisfactory design product is often accompanied by a successful color scheme. Over time, color design tools with the function of generating color schemes were developed to facilitate color harmonizing for designers.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2006-06-01|title=Applying colour science in colour design|url=|journal=Optics & Laser Technology|language=en|volume=38|issue=4\u20136|pages=392\u2013398|doi=10.1016/j.optlastec.2005.06.025|issn=0030-3992|last1=Luo|first1=Ming Ronnier}}</ref>\n\n==== Use of color in visual design ====\n\n* Color is used to create harmony, balance, and visual comfort in a design<ref name=\":3\" />\n* Color is used to evoke the desired mood and emotion upon the viewer<ref name=\":0\" />\n* Color is used to create a [[Theme (arts)|theme]] in the design<ref name=\":1\" />\n* Color holds meaning and can be symbolic.

Lines can be vertical, horizontal, diagonal or curved. They can be any width or texture. And can be continuous, implied, or broken. On top of that, there are different types of line, aside from the ones previously mentioned. For example, you could have a line that is \nhorizontal and zigzagged or a line that is vertical and zigzagged. Different lines create different moods, it all depends on what mood you are using a line to create.\n\n=== Point ===\nA Point is basically the beginning of \u201csomething\u201d in \u201cnothing\u201d. It forces the mind to think upon its position and gives something to build upon in both imagination and space. Some abstract points in a group can provoke human imagination to link it with familiar shapes or forms\n\n===Shape===\n{{main|Shape and form (visual arts)}}\nA [[shape]] is defined as a two dimensional area that stands out from the space next to or around it due to a defined or implied boundary, or because of differences of value, color, or texture.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ehhs.kent.edu/community/VLO/design/elements/shape/index.html | title=Visual Literacy |author=Cindy Kovalik, Ph.D. and Peggy King, M.Ed. |accessdate=2010-03-27}}</ref> Shapes are recognizable objects and forms<ref name=\":0\" /> and are usually composed of other elements of design.<ref name=\"Design Notes\">{{cite web|last=Saw|first=James|title=Design Notes|url=http://daphne.palomar.edu/design/Default.htm|publisher=Palomar College|accessdate=3 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nFor example, a [[square]] that is drawn on a piece of paper is considered a shape. It is created with a series of lines which serve as a boundary that shapes the square and separates it from the space around it that is not part of the square.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n====Types of shapes====\n[[Geometric shape|'''Geometric shapes''']] or mechanical shapes are shapes that can be drawn using a ruler or compass, such as [[square]]s, [[circle]]s, [[triangle]]s, [[ellipse]]s, [[parallelogram]]s, [[Star polygon|stars]], and so on.<ref name=\":0\" /> Mechanical shapes, whether simple or complex, produce a feeling of control and order.<ref name=\"Design Notes\" />\n\n[[Organic form|'''Organic shapes''']] are irregular shapes<ref name=\":0\" /> that are often complex and resemble shapes that are found in [[nature]].<ref name=\"Design Notes\" /> Organic shapes can be drawn by hand, which is why they are sometimes subjective and only exist in the imagination of the artist.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n'''Curvilinear shapes''' are composed of curved lines and smooth edges. They give off a more natural feeling to the shape. In contrast, '''rectilinear shapes''' are composed of sharp edges and [[right angle]]s, and give off a sense of order in the [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]]. They look more human-made, structured, and [[Artificiality|artificial]]. Artists can choose to create a composition that revolves mainly around one of these styles of shape, or they can choose to combine both.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Texture===\n{{main|Texture (visual arts)}}\n[[File:Texture arbre.jpg|thumb|This is only a two dimensional image of a tree, but appears to have the texture of three dimensional bark.]]\n[[Texture (visual arts)|Texture]] refers to the physical and visual qualities of a surface.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n==== Uses of texture in design ====\n\n* Texture can be used to attract or repel interest to an element, depending on how pleasant the texture is perceived to be.<ref name=\"Design Notes\" /> \n* Texture can also be used to add complex detail into the [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]] of a design.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n* In theatrical design, the surface qualities of a costume sculpts the look and feel of a character, which influences the way the audience reacts to the character.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n;Types of texture\n\n'''Tactile texture''', also known as \"actual texture\", refers to the physical three-dimensional texture of an object. Tactile texture can be perceived by the sense of touch. A person can feel the tactile texture of a sculpture by running their hand over its surface and feelings its ridges and dents.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n* Painters use [[impasto]] to build peaks and create texture in their painting.<ref name=\"Design Notes\" />\n* Texture can be created through [[collage]]. This is when artists assemble three dimensional objects and apply them onto a two-dimensional surface, like a piece of paper or canvas, to create one final composition.<ref name=\":0\" />\n* [[Papier coll\u00e9]] is another collaging technique in which artists glue paper to a surface to create different textures on its surface.<ref name=\":0\" />\n* [[Assemblage (art)|Assemblage]] is a technique that consists of assembling various three-dimensional objects into a sculpture, which can also reveal textures to the viewer.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n'''Visual texture''', also referred to as \"implied texture\", is not detectable by our sense of touch, but by our sense of sight.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} Visual texture is the illusion of a real texture on a two-dimensional surface.<ref name=\":0\" /> Any texture perceived in an image or photograph is a visual texture. A photograph of rough tree bark is considered a visual texture. It creates the impression of a real texture on a two-dimensional surface which would remain smooth to the touch no matter how rough the represented texture is.<ref name=\"Design Notes\" />\n\nIn painting, different [[paint]]s are used to achieve different types of textures. Paints such as [[Oil paint|oil]], [[Acrylic paint|acrylic]], and [[Encaustic painting|encaustic]] are thicker and more [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] and are used to create three-dimensional impressions on the surface. Other paints, such as [[Watercolor painting|watercolor]], tend to be used for visual textures, because they are thinner and have transparency, and do not leave much tactile texture on the surface.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Pattern ====\nMany textures appear to repeat the same [[motif (visual arts)|motif]].<ref name=\":0\" /> When a motif is repeated over and over again in a surface, it results in a '''[[pattern]]'''.<ref name=\"Design Notes\" /> Patterns are frequently used in [[fashion design]] or [[textile design]], where motifs are repeated to create decorative patterns on fabric or other [[textile]] materials.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} Patterns are also used in [[Architecture|architectural design]], where decorative structural elements such as [[window]]s, [[column]]s, or [[pediment]]s, are incorporated into building design.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n===Space===\nIn design, space is concerned with the area deep within the moment of designated design, the design will take place on. For a two-dimensional design, space concerns creating the illusion of a third dimension on a flat surface:<ref name=\"Design Notes\" />\n\n*Overlap is the effect where objects appear to be on top of each other. This illusion makes the top element look closer to the observer. There is no way to determine the depth of the space, only the order of closeness.\n*Shading adds gradiation marks to make an object of a two-dimensional surface seem three-dimensional.\n*Highlight, Transitional Light, Core of the Shadow, Reflected Light, and Cast Shadow give an object a three-dimensional look.<ref name=\"Design Notes\" />\n*Linear Perspective is the concept relating to how an object seems smaller the farther away it gets.\n*Atmospheric Perspective is based on how air acts as a filter to change the appearance of distant objects.\n\n===Form===\nIn visual design, form is described as the way an artist arranges elements in the entirety of a composition.<ref name=\":0\" /> It may also be described as any [[three-dimensional]] object. Form can be measured, from top to bottom (height), side to side (width), and from back to front (depth). Form is also defined by light and dark. It can be defined by the presence of shadows on surfaces or faces of an object. There are two types of form, geometric (artificial) and natural (organic form). Form may be created by the combining of two or more shapes. It may be enhanced by tone, texture or color. It can be illustrated or constructed.\n\n==Principles of design==\n{{See also|Gestalt laws of grouping}}\nPrinciples applied to the '''elements of design''' that bring them together into one design.

However, today most newspapers are also [[electronic publishing|published]] on [[website]]s as [[online newspaper]]s, and some have even abandoned their print versions entirely.\n\nNewspapers developed in the 17th century, as [[newsletter|information sheets for merchants]]. By the early 19th century, many cities in Europe, as well as North and South America, published newspapers.\n\nSome newspapers with high editorial independence, high journalism quality, and large circulation are viewed as [[newspaper of record|newspapers of record]].\n\n== Overview ==\n\nNewspapers are typically published [[newspaper#Daily|daily]] or [[weekly newspaper|weekly]]. [[News magazine]]s are also weekly, but they have a [[magazine]] format.{{Anchor|Article_type_summary_in_lower_lede}} General-interest newspapers typically publish [[article (publishing)#News articles|news articles]] and [[feature story|feature articles]] on national and international news as well as [[local news]]. The news includes [[political journalism|political events and personalities]], [[business journalism|business and finance]], crime, weather, and natural disasters; [[medical journalism|health and medicine]], [[science journalism|science]], and computers and technology; [[sports journalism|sports]]; and [[entertainment journalism|entertainment]], [[society reporting|society]], food and cooking, clothing and home fashion, and [[the arts]].\n\nUsually the paper is divided into sections for each of those major groupings (labeled A, B, C, and so on, with pagination prefixes yielding page numbers A1-A20, B1-B20, C1-C20, and so on). Most traditional papers also feature an editorial page containing [[editorial]]s written by an editor (or by the paper's editorial board) and expressing an opinion on a public issue, opinion articles called \"[[op-ed]]s\" written by guest writers (which are typically in the same section as the editorial), and [[column (periodical)|columns]] that express the personal opinions of [[columnist]]s, usually offering analysis and synthesis that attempts to translate the raw [[data]] of the news into information telling the reader \"what it all means\" and persuading them to concur. Papers also include articles which have no [[byline]]; these articles are written by staff writers.\n\nA wide variety of material has been published in newspapers. Besides the aforementioned news, information and opinions, they include weather forecasts; criticism and reviews of the arts (including [[literature]], [[film]], [[television]], [[theater]], [[fine arts]], and [[architecture]]) and of local services such as restaurants; [[obituary|obituaries]], birth notices and graduation announcements; entertainment features such as crosswords, horoscopes, [[editorial cartoon]]s, [[gag cartoon]]s, and [[comic strip]]s; [[advice column|advice]] columns, [[food column|food]], and other columns; and radio and television listings (program schedules). As of 2017, newspapers may also provide information about new movies and TV shows available on [[streaming video]] services like [[Netflix]]. Newspapers have [[classified ad]] sections where people and businesses can buy small advertisements to sell goods or services; as of 2013, the huge increase in [[Internet]] websites for selling goods, such as [[Craigslist]] and [[eBay]] has led to significantly less classified ad sales for newspapers.\n\nMost newspapers are businesses, and they pay their expenses with a mixture of [[Subscription business model|subscription]] revenue, [[newsagent's shop|newsstand sales]], and advertising revenue (other businesses or individuals pay to place advertisements in the pages, including [[newspaper display advertising|display ads]], [[classified advertising|classified ads]], and [[online advertising|their online equivalents]]). Some newspapers are government-run or at least government-funded; their reliance on advertising revenue and on profitability is less critical to their survival. The [[editorial independence]] of a newspaper is thus always subject to the [[wikt:interest|interests]] of someone, whether owners, advertisers, or a government. Some newspapers with high editorial independence, high journalism quality, and large circulation are viewed as [[newspaper of record|newspapers of record]].\n\nMany newspapers, besides employing journalists on their own payrolls, also subscribe to [[news agency|news agencies]] (wire services) (such as the [[Associated Press]], [[Reuters]], or [[Agence France-Presse]]), which employ journalists to find, assemble, and report the news, then sell the [[content (media)|content]] to the various newspapers. This is a way to avoid duplicating the expense of reporting from around the world. Circa 2005, there were approximately 6,580 daily newspaper titles in the world selling 395 million print copies a day (in the U.S., 1,450 titles selling 55&nbsp;million copies).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nieworld.com/cc/NewspaperADailyMiracle.pdf|title=''A Daily Miracle: A student guide to journalism and the newspaper business'' (2007)|date=|accessdate=21 May 2012}}</ref> The [[Great Recession|late 2000s\u2013early 2010s global recession]], combined with the rapid growth of free web-based alternatives, has helped cause a decline in advertising and circulation, as many papers had to retrench operations to stanch the losses.<ref>{{cite news|author=Plambeck, Joseph|title=Newspaper Circulation Falls Nearly 9%|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/27/business/media/27audit.html?scp=3&sq=newspapers&st=Search|newspaper=The New York Times|date=26 April 2010}}</ref> Worldwide annual revenue approached $100&nbsp;billion in 2005-7, then plunged during the worldwide financial crisis of 2008-9.

Besides remodeling advertising, the internet (especially the [[World Wide Web|web]]) has also challenged the business models of the print-only era by [[crowdsourcing]] both publishing in general (sharing information with others) and, more specifically, [[journalism]] (the work of finding, assembling, and reporting the news). In addition, the rise of [[news aggregator]]s, which bundle linked articles from many online newspapers and other sources, influences the flow of [[web traffic]]. Increasing [[paywall]]ing of online newspapers may be counteracting those effects. The oldest newspaper still published is the '''''[[Ordinari Post Tijdender]]''''', which was established in [[Stockholm]] in 1645.\n\n===Definitions===\nNewspapers typically meet four criteria:<ref>Werner Faulstich: \"Grundwissen Medien\", 4th ed., ya UTB, 2000, {{ISBN|978-3-8252-8169-4}}, chapter 4</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Rehm|first=Margarete|url=http://www.ib.hu-berlin.de/~wumsta/infopub/textbook/umfeld/rehm5.html|title=Margarete Rehm: Information und Kommunikaegenwart.

While online newspapers have increased access to newspapers by people with Internet access, people without Internet or computer access (e.g., [[homelessness|homeless people]], [[poverty|impoverished people]] and people living in remote or rural regions may [[Digital divide|not be able to access the Internet]], and thus will not be able to read online news). [[Literacy]] is also a factor which prevents [[Illiteracy|people who cannot read]] from being able to benefit from reading newspapers (paper or online).\n* [[Frequency|Periodicity]]: They are published at regular intervals, typically daily or weekly. This ensures that newspapers can provide information on newly-emerging news stories or events.\n* Currency: Its information is as up to date as its publication schedule allows. The degree of up-to-date-ness of a print newspaper is limited by the need of time to print and distribute the newspaper. In major cities, there may be a morning edition and a later edition of the same day's paper, so that the later edition can incorporate [[breaking news]] that have occurred since the morning edition was printed. Online newspapers can be updated as frequently as new information becomes available, even a number of times per day, which means that online editions can be very up-to-date.\n* Universality: Newspapers covers a range of topics, from political and business news to updates on science and technology, arts, culture, and entertainment.\n\n==History==\n\n===Gazettes and bulletins===\nIn [[Ancient Rome]], ''[[Acta Diurna]]'', or government announcement bulletins, were produced. They were carved in metal or stone and posted in public places. In China, early government-produced news-sheets, called [[Dibao (ancient Chinese Gazette)|Dibao]], circulated among court officials during the late [[Han dynasty]] (second and third centuries AD). Between 713 and 734, the ''[[Kaiyuan Za Bao]]'' (\"Bulletin of the Court\") of the Chinese [[Tang Dynasty]] published government news; it was handwritten on silk and read by government officials. In 1582, there was the first reference to privately published newssheets in Beijing, during the late [[Ming Dynasty]].<ref name=\"brook xxi\">[[Timothy Brook (historian)|Brook, Timothy]]. (1998).

More specialist still are some weekly newspapers, usually free and distributed within limited regional areas; these may serve communities as specific as certain immigrant populations, the local [[gay]] community or [[indie rock]] enthusiasts within a city or region.\n\n===Frequency===\n\n====Daily====\nA '''daily newspaper''' is printed every day, sometimes with the exception of Sundays and occasionally Saturdays, (and some major holidays)<ref>Example of Monday to Friday-only publishing: the London [[Evening Standard]], once a paid newspaper, now free-of-charge, aimed largely at commuters, does not publish on Saturdays</ref> and often of some [[List of holidays by country|national holidays]]. Saturday and, where they exist, Sunday editions of daily newspapers tend to be larger, include more specialized sections (e.g., on arts, films, entertainment) and advertising inserts, and cost more. Typically, the majority of these newspapers' staff members work Monday to Friday, so the Sunday and Monday editions largely depend on content done in advance or content that is syndicated. Most daily newspapers are sold in the morning.\n\nAfternoon or evening papers, once common but now scarce, are aimed more at commuters and office workers. In practice (though this may vary according to country), a morning newspaper is available in early editions from before midnight on the night before its [[cover date]], further editions being printed and distributed during the night. The later editions can include [[breaking news]] which was first revealed that day, after the morning edition was already printed. Previews of tomorrow's newspapers are often a feature of late night news programs, such as [[Newsnight]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. In 1650, the first daily newspaper appeared,  ''Einkommende Zeitung'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leipzig.de/buergerservice-und-verwaltung/unsere-stadt/stadtgeschichte/historisches-aus-1000-jahren/erste-tageszeitung-kam-aus-leipzig/|title=Erste Tageszeitung kam aus Leipzig|author=|date=|website=www.leipzig.de}}</ref> published by [[Timotheus Ritzsch]] in [[Leipzig]], Germany.<ref>Johannes Weber, . \"Strassburg, 1605: The origins of the newspaper in Europe.\" ''German History'' 24.3 (2006): 387-412.</ref>\n\nIn the United Kingdom and some other Commonwealth countries, unlike most other countries, \"daily\" newspapers do not publish on Sundays. In the past there were independent Sunday newspapers; nowadays the same publisher often produces a [[Sunday newspaper]], distinct in many ways from the daily, usually with a related name; e.g., ''[[The Times]]'' and ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' are distinct newspapers owned by the same company, and an article published in the latter would never be credited to ''The Times''.\n\nIn some cases a Sunday edition is an expanded version of a newspaper from the same publisher; in other cases, particularly in Britain, it may be a separate enterprise, e.g., ''[[The Observer]]'', not affiliated with a daily newspaper from its founding in 1791 until it was acquired by ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 1993. Usually, it is a specially expanded edition, often several times the thickness and weight of the weekday editions and contain generally special sections not found in the weekday editions, such as [[Sunday comics]], Sunday magazines (such as ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' and ''[[The Sunday Times Magazine]]'').\n\nIn some countries daily newspapers are not published on [[Christmas Day]], but weekly newspapers would change their day e.g. Sunday newspapers are published on Saturday December 24, [[Christmas Eve]] when [[Christmas Day]] is falling on Sunday.\n\n====Weekly and other====\n{{main|Weekly newspaper}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 133-075, Worms, Antisemitische Presse, \"St\u00fcrmerkasten\".jpg|thumb|Public reading of the anti-Semitic weekly newspaper ''[[Der St\u00fcrmer]]'', [[Worms, Germany]], 1935]]\n[[Weekly newspaper]]s are published once a week, and tend to be smaller than daily papers. Some newspapers are published two or three times a week and are known as semi-weekly publications. Some publications are published, for example, fortnightly (or biweekly in American parlance). They have a change from normal weekly day of the week during the Christmas period depending the day of the week [[Christmas Day]] is falling on.\n\n===Geographical scope and distribution===\n\n====Local or regional====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2018}}\nA '''local newspaper''' serves a region such as a city, or part of a large city.\nAlmost every market has one or two newspapers that dominate the area. Large metropolitan newspapers often have large distribution networks, and can be found outside their normal area, sometimes widely, sometimes from fewer sources.\n\n====National====\n{{See also|List of national newspapers}}\n[[File:Street Scene - Salta - Argentina.jpg|thumb|Newspaper stand in [[Salta]] ([[Argentina]]).]]\nMost nations have at least one newspaper that circulates throughout the whole country: a '''national newspaper'''. Some national newspapers, such as the ''[[Financial Times]]'' and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', are specialised (in these examples, on financial matters). There are many [[List of newspapers in the United Kingdom|national newspapers in the United Kingdom]], but only a [[List of newspapers in the United States|few in the United States]] and [[List of newspapers in Canada|Canada]]. In Canada, ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' is sold throughout the country.

Some, such as ''[[The New York Times International Edition]]'', (formerly The International Herald Tribune) have always had that focus, while others are repackaged national newspapers or \"international editions\" of national or large metropolitan newspapers. In some cases, articles that might not interest the wider range of readers are omitted from international editions; in others, of interest to [[expatriates]], significant national news is retained. As English became the international language of business and technology, many newspapers formerly published only in non-English languages have also developed English-language editions. In places as varied as [[Jerusalem]] and [[Mumbai]], newspapers are printed for a local and international English-speaking public, and for tourists. The advent of the Internet has also allowed non-English-language newspapers to put out a scaled-down English version to give their newspaper a global outreach.\n\nSimilarly, in many countries with a large foreign-language-speaking population or many tourists, newspapers in languages other than the national language are both published locally and imported. For example, newspapers and magazines from many countries, and [[List of newspapers in the United Kingdom#Non-English-language newspapers|locally published newspapers in many languages]], are readily to be found on news-stands in central London. In the US state of [[Florida]], so many tourists from the French-speaking Canadian province of [[Quebec]] visit for long stays during the winter (\"[[snowbird (person)|snowbirds]]\") that some newsstands and stores sell French-language newspapers such as ''[[Le Droit]]''.\n\n===Subject matter===\nGeneral newspapers cover all topics, with different emphasis. While at least mentioning all topics, some might have good coverage of international events of importance; others might concentrate more on national or local entertainment or sports. Specialised newspapers might concentrate more specifically on, for example, financial matters. There are publications covering exclusively sports, or certain sports, horse-racing, theatre, and so on, although they may no longer be called newspapers.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n===Technology===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-85461-0005, Berlin, Mauerbau, NVA-Panzersoldaten.jpg|thumb|upright|Soldiers in an [[East Germany|East German]] tank unit reading about the erection of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1961 in the newspaper [[Neues Deutschland]]]]\n\n====Print====\nFor centuries newspapers were printed on paper and supplied physically to readers either by local distribution, or in some cases by mail, for example for British expatriates living in India or Hong Kong who subscribed to British newspapers. Newspapers can be delivered to subscribers homes and/or businesses by a paper's own delivery people, sent via the [[mail]], sold at [[newsstand]]s, [[grocery store]]s and [[convenience store]]s, and delivered to [[library|libraries]] and [[bookstore]]s. Newspaper organizations need a large distribution system to deliver their papers to these different distributors, which typically involves delivery trucks and delivery people.\nIn recent years, newspapers and other media have adapted to the changing technology environment by starting to offer online editions to cater to the needs of the public. In the future, the trend towards more electronic delivery of the news will continue with more emphasis on the Internet, social media and other electronic delivery methods. However, while the method of delivery is changing, the newspaper and the industry still has a niche in the world.\n\n====Online====\n{{Main|Online newspaper}}\nAs of 2007, virtually all major printed newspapers have online editions distributed over the Internet which, depending on the country may be regulated by journalism organizations such as the [[Press Complaints Commission]] in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.journalism.co.uk/news/story3152.shtml|title=Journalism Magazine|publisher=Journalism.co.uk|date=19 January 2007|accessdate=21 February 2012}}</ref> But as some publishers find their print-based models increasingly unsustainable,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2017/jan/24/winning-back-advertisers-is-key-to-saving-the-newspaper-industry|title=Guardian News and Media Limited|publisher=theguardian.com|date=24 January 2017|accessdate=24 January 2017}}</ref> Web-based \"newspapers\" have also started to appear, such as the ''[[Southport Reporter]]'' in the UK and the ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'', which stopped publishing in print after 149 years in March 2009 and became an online-only paper.\n\nSince 2005 in the UK more than 200 regional newspapers have closed down resulting in 50% decline in the number of regional journalists. A 2016 study done by King's College London found that the towns which lost their local newspapers receded from the democratic values and experienced the loss of public faith in the authorities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-43106436|title=The death of the local newspaper?|last=|first=|date=20 February 2018|website=BBC|access-date=24 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nA new trend in newspaper publishing is the introduction of [[personalization]] through [[on-demand printing]] technologies or with online news aggregator websites like [[Google news]]. Customized newspapers allow the reader to create their individual newspaper through the selection of individual pages from multiple publications. This \"Best of\" approach allows revival of the print-based model and opens up a new distribution channel to increase coverage beneath the usual boundaries of distribution. Customized newspapers online have been offered by MyYahoo, I-Google, CRAYON, ICurrent.com, Kibboko.com, Twitter. times and many others. With these online newspapers, the reader can select how much of each section (politics, sports, arts, etc.) they wish to see in their news.\n\n==Organization and personnel==\n[[File:Gazeta Lubuska newsroom.jpg|thumb|left|The newsroom of Gazeta Lubuska in [[Zielona G\u00f3ra]], Poland]]\nIn the United States, the overall manager or chief executive of the newspaper is the publisher.<ref>{{cite web|title=Career Guide to Industries, 2010\u201311 Edition: Publishing, Except Software|url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/cg/cgs013.htm|publisher=U.S. Department of Labor|author=Bureau of Labor Statistics|date=17 December 2009|accessdate=28 May 2010}}</ref> In small newspapers, the owner of the publication (or the largest shareholder in the corporation that owns the publication) is usually the publisher. Although he or she rarely or perhaps never writes stories, the publisher is legally responsible for the contents of the entire newspaper and also runs the business, including hiring editors, reporters, and other staff members. This title is less common outside the U.S. The equivalent position in the film industry and television news shows is the executive producer.{{citation needed|date=May 2010}} Most newspapers have four main departments devoted to publishing the newspaper itself\u2014editorial, production/printing, circulation, and advertising, although they are frequently referred to by a variety of other names\u2014as well as the non-newspaper-specific departments also found in other businesses of comparable size, such as accounting, marketing, human resources, and IT.\n\nThroughout the English-speaking world, the person who selects the content for the newspaper is usually referred to as the editor. Variations on this title such as editor-in-chief, executive editor, and so on are common. For small newspapers, a single editor may be responsible for all content areas. At large newspapers, the most senior editor is in overall charge of the publication, while less senior editors may each focus on one subject area, such as local news or sports. These divisions are called [[news bureau]]s or \"desks\", and each is supervised by a designated editor. Most newspaper editors [[copy edit]] the stories for their part of the newspaper, but they may share their workload with [[proofreader]]s and [[fact checker]]s.\n[[File:Newsboy in 1905.jpg|thumb|A [[Newspaper delivery|newsboy]] in 1905 selling the ''[[Toronto Telegram]]'' in Canada]]\n\n[[Reporter]]s are journalists who primarily report facts that they have gathered and those who write longer, less news-oriented articles may be called feature writers. Photographers and [[graphic artist]]s provide images and illustrations to support articles. Journalists often specialize in a subject area, called a [[Beat reporting|beat]], such as sports, religion, or science. Columnists are journalists who write regular articles recounting their personal opinions and experiences. [[Printer (publishing)|Printers]] and press operators physically print the newspaper. Printing is outsourced by many newspapers, partly because of the cost of an [[Offset printing|offset web press]] (the most common kind of press used to print newspapers) and also because a small newspaper's [[print run]] might require less than an hour of operation, meaning that if the newspaper had its own press it would sit idle most of the time. If the newspaper offers information online, [[webmaster]]s and [[web designer]]s may be employed to upload stories to the newspaper's website.\n\nThe staff of the [[Newspaper circulation|circulation department]] liaise with retailers who sell the newspaper; sell subscriptions; and supervise distribution of the printed newspapers through the mail, by [[newspaper carrier]]s, at retailers, and through vending machines. [[Free newspapers]] do not sell subscriptions, but they still have a circulation department responsible for distributing the newspapers. Sales staff in the advertising department not only sell ad space to clients such as local businesses, but also help clients design and plan their advertising campaigns. Other members of the advertising department may include [[graphic designer]]s, who design ads according to the customers' specifications and the department's policies. In an [[Advertising-free media|advertising-free newspaper]], there is no advertising department.\n\n==Zoned and other editions==\n[[File:Newspapers.jpg|thumb|Israeli daily newspaper ''[[Haaretz]]'', seen in its [[Hebrew]] and English language editions]]\nNewspapers often refine distribution of ads and news through zoning and editioning. Zoning occurs when advertising and editorial content change to reflect the location to which the product is delivered. The editorial content often may change merely to reflect changes in advertising\u2014the quantity and layout of which affects the space available for editorial\u2014or may contain region-specific news. In rare instances, the advertising may not change from one zone to another, but there will be different region-specific editorial content. As the content can vary widely, zoned editions are often produced in parallel. Editioning occurs in the main sections as news is updated throughout the night. The advertising is usually the same in each edition (with the exception of zoned regionals, in which it is often the 'B' section of local news that undergoes advertising changes). As each edition represents the latest news available for the next press run, these editions are produced linearly, with one completed edition being copied and updated for the next edition. The previous edition is always copied to maintain a Newspaper of Record and to fall back on if a quick correction is needed for the press. For example, both ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' offer a regional edition, printed through a local contractor, and featuring locale specific content. The Journal's global advertising [[rate card]] provides a good example of editioning.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://advertising.wsj.com/rates/index.html |title=WSJ Advertising: Rates |publisher=Advertising.wsj.com |accessdate=10 October 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029083017/http://advertising.wsj.com/rates/index.html |archivedate=29 October 2008 }}</ref>\n\n''See also [[Los Angeles Times suburban sections]].''\n\n==Format==\n[[File:Newspapers of Japan 20090831.jpg|thumb|[[Yomiuri Shimbun]], a broadsheet in Japan credited with having the largest newspaper circulation in the world]]\nMost modern newspapers<ref>See K.G.

Since the 1980s, the newspaper industry has largely moved away from lower-quality [[letterpress printing]] to higher-quality, [[CMYK color model|four-color process]], [[offset printing]]. In addition, desktop computers, [[word processor|word processing software]], [[graphics software]], [[digital camera]]s and digital [[prepress]] and [[typesetting]] technologies have revolutionized the newspaper production process. These technologies have enabled newspapers to publish color photographs and graphics, as well as innovative [[Page layout|layouts]] and better design.\n\nTo help their titles stand out on newsstands, some newspapers are printed on coloured newsprint. For example, the ''[[Financial Times]]'' is printed on a distinctive salmon pink paper, and [[Sheffield]]'s weekly sports publication derives its name, the ''[[Green Un|Green 'Un]]'', from the traditional colour of its paper. The Italian sports newspaper ''[[La Gazzetta dello Sport]]'' is also printed on pink paper while ''[[L'\u00c9quipe]]'' (formerly ''L'Auto'') is printed on yellow paper. Both the latter promoted major cycling races and their newsprint colours were reflected in the colours of the jerseys used to denote the race leader; for example the leader in the [[Giro d'Italia]] wears a pink jersey.\n\n==Circulation and readership==\n{{Main|List of newspapers in the World by circulation|Newspaper circulation|Ageing of newspaper readership}}\n[[File:Newspaper vendor.jpg|thumb|left|Newspaper vendor, [[Paddington]], London, February 2005]]\nThe number of copies distributed, either on an average day or on particular days (typically Sunday), is called the newspaper's circulation and is one of the principal factors used to set advertising rates. Circulation is not necessarily the same as copies sold, since some copies or newspapers are distributed without cost. Readership figures may be higher than circulation figures because many copies are read by more than one person, although this is offset by the number of copies distributed but not read (especially for those distributed free). In the United States, the [[Alliance for Audited Media]] maintains historical and current data on average circulation of daily and weekly newspapers and other periodicals.\n\nAccording to the ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]'', the daily circulation of the Soviet newspaper ''[[Trud (Russian newspaper)|Trud]]'' exceeded 21,500,000 in 1990, while the Soviet weekly ''[[Argumenty i Fakty]]'' boasted a circulation of 33,500,000 in 1991. According to United Nations data from 1995 Japan has three daily papers\u2014the ''[[Yomiuri Shimbun]]'', ''[[Asahi Shimbun]]'', and ''[[Mainichi Shimbun]]''\u2014with circulations well above 5.5&nbsp;million. Germany's ''[[Bild-Zeitung|Bild]]'', with a circulation of 3.8&nbsp;million, was the only other paper in that category. In the United Kingdom, ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' is the top seller, with around 3.24&nbsp;million copies distributed daily. In the U.S., ''The Wall Street Journal'' has a daily circulation of approximately 2.02&nbsp;million, making it the most widely distributed paper in the country.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2010138873_apusnewspapercirculation.html|title=Newspaper circulation drop accelerates April\u2013Sept|author=Liedtke, Michael|newspaper=The Seattle Times|date=26 October 2009|accessdate=26 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nWhile paid readership of print newspapers has been steadily declining in the developed [[OECD]] nations, it has been rising in the chief developing nations (Brazil, India, Indonesia, China and South Africa), whose paid daily circulation exceeded those of the developed nations for the first time in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/30/24/45559596.pdf|title=The evolution of news and the internet|author=OECD Working Party on the Information Economy|date=11 June 2010|accessdate=14 July 2011}}\"Growth in the BIICS countries by about 35% from 2000 to 2008 very much contributed to this growth, most notably India with a 45% increase in circulation between 2000 and 2008, South Africa (34%) and China (an estimated 29%).

As other media began to compete with newspapers, and as printing became easier and less expensive giving rise to a greater diversity of publications, market penetration began to decline. It wasn't until the early 1970s, however, that market penetration dipped below 100 percent.

For example, someone might want only a Sunday paper, or perhaps only Sunday and Saturday, or maybe only a [[workweek]] subscription, or perhaps a daily subscription. Most newspapers provide some or all of their content on the Internet, either at no cost or for a fee. In some cases, free access is available only for a matter of days or weeks, or for a certain number of viewed articles, after which readers must register and provide personal data. In other cases, free archives are provided.\n\n==Advertising==\n[[File:C & A Speciale Mantel-Aanbieding.jpg|thumb|1938 Dutch newspaper advertisement for women's clothing sold at [[C&A]] stores]]\nA newspaper typically generates 70\u201380% of its revenue from advertising, and the remainder from sales and subscriptions.<ref name=\"business_model_1996\">{{cite news\n|url=https://www.academia.edu/4894990\n|title=Online Revenue Business Model Has Changed Little Since 1996|publisher=[[Newspaper Research Journal]]|author=Mensing, Donica|date=Spring 2007}}</ref> The portion of the newspaper that is not advertising is called ''editorial content'', ''editorial matter'', or simply ''editorial'', although the last term is also used to refer specifically to those articles in which the newspaper and its guest writers express their opinions.

Rather than charging 6 cents per copy, the price of a typical New York daily at the time, they charged 1-cent, and depended on advertising to make up the difference.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/18904178|title=Reinventing the newspaper|date=7 July 2011|accessdate=13 July 2011|work=The Economist}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Naa newspaper ad revenue.svg|thumb|US Newspaper Advertising Revenue -  ''Newspaper Association of America published data''<ref name=NAAdata>{{cite web|title=Trends & Numbers |date=14 March 2012 |publisher=[[Newspaper Association of America]] |accessdate=18 September 2012 |url=http://www.naa.org/Trends-and-Numbers/Advertising-Expenditures/Annual-All-Categories.aspx |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918094825/http://www.naa.org/Trends-and-Numbers/Advertising-Expenditures/Annual-All-Categories.aspx |archivedate=18 September 2012 }}</ref>]]\n\nNewspapers in countries with easy access to the [[World Wide Web|web]] have been hurt by the decline of many traditional advertisers.

The classified category is shifting to sites including [[Craigslist]], employment websites, and auto sites. National advertisers are shifting to many types of digital content including websites, rich media platforms, and mobile.\n\nIn recent years, the [[advertorial]] emerged. Advertorials are most commonly recognized as an [[Editorial|opposite-editorial]] which third parties pay a fee to have included in the paper. [[Advertorial]]s commonly advertise new products or techniques, such as a new design for golf equipment, a new form of laser surgery, or weight-loss drugs. The tone is usually closer to that of a [[press release]] than of an objective [[news story]]. Such articles are often clearly distinguished from editorial content through either the design and layout of the page or with a label declaring the article as an advertisement. However, there has been growing concern over the blurring of the line between editorial and advertorial content.<ref>{{Cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/may/16/blurring-lines-between-advertising-and-editorial|title = Dangerous blend: how lines between editorial and advertising are blurring|last = Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric|first = Filloux|date = 16 May 2011|work = The Guardian|accessdate = 5 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Journalism==\n{{Main|Journalism}}\n[[File:Severnyi krai.jpg|thumb|The editorial staff of newspaper \"Severnyi Kray\" in [[Yaroslavl]], Russia in 1900]]\nSince newspapers began as a journal (record of current events), the profession involved in the making of newspapers began to be called ''journalism''. In the [[yellow journalism]] era of the 19th century, many newspapers in the United States relied on sensational stories that were meant to anger or excite the public, rather than to inform. The restrained style of reporting that relies on fact checking and accuracy regained popularity around [[World War II]]. Criticism of journalism is varied and sometimes vehement. Credibility is questioned because of anonymous sources; errors in facts, spelling, and grammar; real or perceived [[bias]]; and scandals involving [[plagiarism]] and fabrication.\n\nIn the past, newspapers have often been owned by so-called [[press baron]]s, and were used for gaining a political voice. After 1920 most major newspapers became parts of chains run by large media corporations such as [[Gannett]], [[The McClatchy Company]], [[Hearst Corporation]], [[Cox Enterprises]], [[Landmark Media Enterprises LLC]], [[Morris Communications]], [[Tribune Company|The Tribune Company]], [[Hollinger Inc.|Hollinger International]], [[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]], [[Swift Communications]], etc. Newspapers have, in the modern world, played an important role in the exercise of freedom of expression. Whistle-blowers, and those who \"leak\" stories of corruption in political circles often choose to inform newspapers before other mediums of communication, relying on the perceived willingness of newspaper editors to expose the secrets and lies of those who would rather cover them. However, there have been many circumstances of the political autonomy of newspapers being curtailed. Recent research has examined the effects of a newspaper's closing on the reelection of incumbents, voter turnout, and campaign spending.<ref>[https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/wp/wp686.pdf Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, ''Do Newspapers Matter?'', 2011]</ref>\n\nOpinions of other writers and readers are expressed in the ''[[op-ed]]'' (\"opposite the editorial page\") and [[letter to the editor|''letters to the editors'']] sections of the paper. Some ways newspapers have tried to improve their credibility are: appointing [[ombudsman|ombudsmen]], developing ethics policies and training, using more stringent corrections policies, communicating their processes and rationale with readers, and asking sources to review articles after publication.\n\n==Impact of television and Internet==\n{{Main|Decline of newspapers}}\n{{Further|Online newspapers}}\n[[File:2010 newspaper press France 5125942563.jpg|thumb|upright|Newspaper press in [[Limoges]], France]]\nBy the late 1990s, the availability of news via 24-hour television channels and the subsequent availability of [[online journalism]] posed an ongoing challenge to the business model of most newspapers in developed countries. Paid [[newspaper circulation]] has declined, while advertising revenue\u2014the bulk of most newspapers' income\u2014has been shifting from print to [[social media]] and news websites, resulting in a general decline. One of the challenges is that a number of online news websites are free to access. Other online news sites have a [[paywall]] and require paid subscription for access. In less-developed countries, cheaper printing and distribution, increased literacy, a growing middle class, and other factors have compensated for the emergence of electronic media, and newspaper circulation continues to grow.<ref>N.

The [[journalism]] organizations that publish newspapers are themselves often [[metonymy|metonymically]] called newspapers.\n\nNewspapers have traditionally been published [[printing|in print]] (usually on cheap, low-grade [[paper]] called [[newsprint]]). However, today most newspapers are also [[electronic publishing|published]] on [[website]]s as [[online newspaper]]s, and some have even abandoned their print versions entirely.\n\nNewspapers developed in the 17th century, as [[newsletter|information sheets for merchants]]. By the early 19th century, many cities in Europe, as well as North and South America, published newspapers.\n\nSome newspapers with high editorial independence, high journalism quality, and large circulation are viewed as [[newspaper of record|newspapers of record]].\n\n== Overview ==\n\nNewspapers are typically published [[newspaper#Daily|daily]] or [[weekly newspaper|weekly]]. [[News magazine]]s are also weekly, but they have a [[magazine]] format.{{Anchor|Article_type_summary_in_lower_lede}} General-interest newspapers typically publish [[article (publishing)#News articles|news articles]] and [[feature story|feature articles]] on national and international news as well as [[local news]]. The news includes [[political journalism|political events and personalities]], [[business journalism|business and finance]], crime, weather, and natural disasters; [[medical journalism|health and medicine]], [[science journalism|science]], and computers and technology; [[sports journalism|sports]]; and [[entertainment journalism|entertainment]], [[society reporting|society]], food and cooking, clothing and home fashion, and [[the arts]].\n\nUsually the paper is divided into sections for each of those major groupings (labeled A, B, C, and so on, with pagination prefixes yielding page numbers A1-A20, B1-B20, C1-C20, and so on). Most traditional papers also feature an editorial page containing [[editorial]]s written by an editor (or by the paper's editorial board) and expressing an opinion on a public issue, opinion articles called \"[[op-ed]]s\" written by guest writers (which are typically in the same section as the editorial), and [[column (periodical)|columns]] that express the personal opinions of [[columnist]]s, usually offering analysis and synthesis that attempts to translate the raw [[data]] of the news into information telling the reader \"what it all means\" and persuading them to concur. Papers also include articles which have no [[byline]]; these articles are written by staff writers.\n\nA wide variety of material has been published in newspapers. Besides the aforementioned news, information and opinions, they include weather forecasts; criticism and reviews of the arts (including [[literature]], [[film]], [[television]], [[theater]], [[fine arts]], and [[architecture]]) and of local services such as restaurants; [[obituary|obituaries]], birth notices and graduation announcements; entertainment features such as crosswords, horoscopes, [[editorial cartoon]]s, [[gag cartoon]]s, and [[comic strip]]s; [[advice column|advice]] columns, [[food column|food]], and other columns; and radio and television listings (program schedules). As of 2017, newspapers may also provide information about new movies and TV shows available on [[streaming video]] services like [[Netflix]]. Newspapers have [[classified ad]] sections where people and businesses can buy small advertisements to sell goods or services; as of 2013, the huge increase in [[Internet]] websites for selling goods, such as [[Craigslist]] and [[eBay]] has led to significantly less classified ad sales for newspapers.\n\nMost newspapers are businesses, and they pay their expenses with a mixture of [[Subscription business model|subscription]] revenue, [[newsagent's shop|newsstand sales]], and advertising revenue (other businesses or individuals pay to place advertisements in the pages, including [[newspaper display advertising|display ads]], [[classified advertising|classified ads]], and [[online advertising|their online equivalents]]). Some newspapers are government-run or at least government-funded; their reliance on advertising revenue and on profitability is less critical to their survival. The [[editorial independence]] of a newspaper is thus always subject to the [[wikt:interest|interests]] of someone, whether owners, advertisers, or a government. Some newspapers with high editorial independence, high journalism quality, and large circulation are viewed as [[newspaper of record|newspapers of record]].\n\nMany newspapers, besides employing journalists on their own payrolls, also subscribe to [[news agency|news agencies]] (wire services) (such as the [[Associated Press]], [[Reuters]], or [[Agence France-Presse]]), which employ journalists to find, assemble, and report the news, then sell the [[content (media)|content]] to the various newspapers. This is a way to avoid duplicating the expense of reporting from around the world. Circa 2005, there were approximately 6,580 daily newspaper titles in the world selling 395 million print copies a day (in the U.S., 1,450 titles selling 55&nbsp;million copies).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nieworld.com/cc/NewspaperADailyMiracle.pdf|title=''A Daily Miracle: A student guide to journalism and the newspaper business'' (2007)|date=|accessdate=21 May 2012}}</ref> The [[Great Recession|late 2000s\u2013early 2010s global recession]], combined with the rapid growth of free web-based alternatives, has helped cause a decline in advertising and circulation, as many papers had to retrench operations to stanch the losses.<ref>{{cite news|author=Plambeck, Joseph|title=Newspaper Circulation Falls Nearly 9%|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/27/business/media/27audit.html?scp=3&sq=newspapers&st=Search|newspaper=The New York Times|date=26 April 2010}}</ref> Worldwide annual revenue approached $100&nbsp;billion in 2005-7, then plunged during the worldwide financial crisis of 2008-9. Revenue in 2016 fell to only $53&nbsp;billion, hurting every major publisher as their efforts to gain online income fell far short of the goal.<ref>Suzanne Vranica and Jack Marshall,   \"Plummeting Newspaper Ad Revenue Sparks New Wave of Changes: With global newspaper print advertising on pace for worst decline since recession, publishers cut costs and restructure\" [https://www.wsj.com/articles/plummeting-newspaper-ad-revenue-sparks-new-wave-of-changes-1476955801?cx_navSource=cx_picks&cx_tag=collabctx&cx_artPos=1#cxrecs_s ''Wall Street Journal'' Oct 20, 2016]</ref>\n\nThe decline in advertising revenues affected both the print and online media as well as all other mediums; print advertising was once lucrative but has greatly declined, and the prices of [[online advertising]] are often lower than those of their print precursors. Besides remodeling advertising, the internet (especially the [[World Wide Web|web]]) has also challenged the business models of the print-only era by [[crowdsourcing]] both publishing in general (sharing information with others) and, more specifically, [[journalism]] (the work of finding, assembling, and reporting the news). In addition, the rise of [[news aggregator]]s, which bundle linked articles from many online newspapers and other sources, influences the flow of [[web traffic]]. Increasing [[paywall]]ing of online newspapers may be counteracting those effects. The oldest newspaper still published is the '''''[[Ordinari Post Tijdender]]''''', which was established in [[Stockholm]] in 1645.\n\n===Definitions===\nNewspapers typically meet four criteria:<ref>Werner Faulstich: \"Grundwissen Medien\", 4th ed., ya UTB, 2000, {{ISBN|978-3-8252-8169-4}}, chapter 4</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Rehm|first=Margarete|url=http://www.ib.hu-berlin.de/~wumsta/infopub/textbook/umfeld/rehm5.html|title=Margarete Rehm: Information und Kommunikaegenwart.

While online newspapers have increased access to newspapers by people with Internet access, people without Internet or computer access (e.g., [[homelessness|homeless people]], [[poverty|impoverished people]] and people living in remote or rural regions may [[Digital divide|not be able to access the Internet]], and thus will not be able to read online news). [[Literacy]] is also a factor which prevents [[Illiteracy|people who cannot read]] from being able to benefit from reading newspapers (paper or online).\n* [[Frequency|Periodicity]]: They are published at regular intervals, typically daily or weekly. This ensures that newspapers can provide information on newly-emerging news stories or events.\n* Currency: Its information is as up to date as its publication schedule allows. The degree of up-to-date-ness of a print newspaper is limited by the need of time to print and distribute the newspaper. In major cities, there may be a morning edition and a later edition of the same day's paper, so that the later edition can incorporate [[breaking news]] that have occurred since the morning edition was printed. Online newspapers can be updated as frequently as new information becomes available, even a number of times per day, which means that online editions can be very up-to-date.\n* Universality: Newspapers covers a range of topics, from political and business news to updates on science and technology, arts, culture, and entertainment.\n\n==History==\n\n===Gazettes and bulletins===\nIn [[Ancient Rome]], ''[[Acta Diurna]]'', or government announcement bulletins, were produced. They were carved in metal or stone and posted in public places. In China, early government-produced news-sheets, called [[Dibao (ancient Chinese Gazette)|Dibao]], circulated among court officials during the late [[Han dynasty]] (second and third centuries AD). Between 713 and 734, the ''[[Kaiyuan Za Bao]]'' (\"Bulletin of the Court\") of the Chinese [[Tang Dynasty]] published government news; it was handwritten on silk and read by government officials. In 1582, there was the first reference to privately published newssheets in Beijing, during the late [[Ming Dynasty]].<ref name=\"brook xxi\">[[Timothy Brook (historian)|Brook, Timothy]]. (1998).

Many editors were not only journalists but also writers, philosophers and politicians. With unofficial journals, these intellectuals encouraged public discourse on politics in the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[History of Iran|Persian]] Empires. Literary works of all genres were serialized and published in the press as well.\n\nThe first newspapers in the Ottoman Empire were owned by foreigners living there who wanted to make propaganda about the Western world.<ref>Stavrianos, p. 211.</ref> The earliest was printed in 1795 by the Palais de France in [[Beyo\u011flu|Pera]].

In 1814, ''[[The Times]]'' (London) acquired a printing press capable of making 1,100 impressions per hour.<ref>Philip B. Meggs, ''A History of Graphic Design'' (1998) pp 130\u2013133</ref> Soon, this press was adapted to print on both sides of a page at once.

Walter's Boston ''[[Boston Evening Transcript|Transcript]]''.<ref>David R.

More specialist still are some weekly newspapers, usually free and distributed within limited regional areas; these may serve communities as specific as certain immigrant populations, the local [[gay]] community or [[indie rock]] enthusiasts within a city or region.\n\n===Frequency===\n\n====Daily====\nA '''daily newspaper''' is printed every day, sometimes with the exception of Sundays and occasionally Saturdays, (and some major holidays)<ref>Example of Monday to Friday-only publishing: the London [[Evening Standard]], once a paid newspaper, now free-of-charge, aimed largely at commuters, does not publish on Saturdays</ref> and often of some [[List of holidays by country|national holidays]]. Saturday and, where they exist, Sunday editions of daily newspapers tend to be larger, include more specialized sections (e.g., on arts, films, entertainment) and advertising inserts, and cost more. Typically, the majority of these newspapers' staff members work Monday to Friday, so the Sunday and Monday editions largely depend on content done in advance or content that is syndicated. Most daily newspapers are sold in the morning.\n\nAfternoon or evening papers, once common but now scarce, are aimed more at commuters and office workers. In practice (though this may vary according to country), a morning newspaper is available in early editions from before midnight on the night before its [[cover date]], further editions being printed and distributed during the night. The later editions can include [[breaking news]] which was first revealed that day, after the morning edition was already printed. Previews of tomorrow's newspapers are often a feature of late night news programs, such as [[Newsnight]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. In 1650, the first daily newspaper appeared,  ''Einkommende Zeitung'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leipzig.de/buergerservice-und-verwaltung/unsere-stadt/stadtgeschichte/historisches-aus-1000-jahren/erste-tageszeitung-kam-aus-leipzig/|title=Erste Tageszeitung kam aus Leipzig|author=|date=|website=www.leipzig.de}}</ref> published by [[Timotheus Ritzsch]] in [[Leipzig]], Germany.<ref>Johannes Weber, . \"Strassburg, 1605: The origins of the newspaper in Europe.\" ''German History'' 24.3 (2006): 387-412.</ref>\n\nIn the United Kingdom and some other Commonwealth countries, unlike most other countries, \"daily\" newspapers do not publish on Sundays. In the past there were independent Sunday newspapers; nowadays the same publisher often produces a [[Sunday newspaper]], distinct in many ways from the daily, usually with a related name; e.g., ''[[The Times]]'' and ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' are distinct newspapers owned by the same company, and an article published in the latter would never be credited to ''The Times''.\n\nIn some cases a Sunday edition is an expanded version of a newspaper from the same publisher; in other cases, particularly in Britain, it may be a separate enterprise, e.g., ''[[The Observer]]'', not affiliated with a daily newspaper from its founding in 1791 until it was acquired by ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 1993. Usually, it is a specially expanded edition, often several times the thickness and weight of the weekday editions and contain generally special sections not found in the weekday editions, such as [[Sunday comics]], Sunday magazines (such as ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' and ''[[The Sunday Times Magazine]]'').\n\nIn some countries daily newspapers are not published on [[Christmas Day]], but weekly newspapers would change their day e.g. Sunday newspapers are published on Saturday December 24, [[Christmas Eve]] when [[Christmas Day]] is falling on Sunday.\n\n====Weekly and other====\n{{main|Weekly newspaper}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 133-075, Worms, Antisemitische Presse, \"St\u00fcrmerkasten\".jpg|thumb|Public reading of the anti-Semitic weekly newspaper ''[[Der St\u00fcrmer]]'', [[Worms, Germany]], 1935]]\n[[Weekly newspaper]]s are published once a week, and tend to be smaller than daily papers. Some newspapers are published two or three times a week and are known as semi-weekly publications. Some publications are published, for example, fortnightly (or biweekly in American parlance). They have a change from normal weekly day of the week during the Christmas period depending the day of the week [[Christmas Day]] is falling on.\n\n===Geographical scope and distribution===\n\n====Local or regional====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2018}}\nA '''local newspaper''' serves a region such as a city, or part of a large city.\nAlmost every market has one or two newspapers that dominate the area.

There are many [[List of newspapers in the United Kingdom|national newspapers in the United Kingdom]], but only a [[List of newspapers in the United States|few in the United States]] and [[List of newspapers in Canada|Canada]].

Some, such as ''[[The New York Times International Edition]]'', (formerly The International Herald Tribune) have always had that focus, while others are repackaged national newspapers or \"international editions\" of national or large metropolitan newspapers. In some cases, articles that might not interest the wider range of readers are omitted from international editions; in others, of interest to [[expatriates]], significant national news is retained. As English became the international language of business and technology, many newspapers formerly published only in non-English languages have also developed English-language editions. In places as varied as [[Jerusalem]] and [[Mumbai]], newspapers are printed for a local and international English-speaking public, and for tourists. The advent of the Internet has also allowed non-English-language newspapers to put out a scaled-down English version to give their newspaper a global outreach.\n\nSimilarly, in many countries with a large foreign-language-speaking population or many tourists, newspapers in languages other than the national language are both published locally and imported. For example, newspapers and magazines from many countries, and [[List of newspapers in the United Kingdom#Non-English-language newspapers|locally published newspapers in many languages]], are readily to be found on news-stands in central London. In the US state of [[Florida]], so many tourists from the French-speaking Canadian province of [[Quebec]] visit for long stays during the winter (\"[[snowbird (person)|snowbirds]]\") that some newsstands and stores sell French-language newspapers such as ''[[Le Droit]]''.\n\n===Subject matter===\nGeneral newspapers cover all topics, with different emphasis. While at least mentioning all topics, some might have good coverage of international events of importance; others might concentrate more on national or local entertainment or sports. Specialised newspapers might concentrate more specifically on, for example, financial matters. There are publications covering exclusively sports, or certain sports, horse-racing, theatre, and so on, although they may no longer be called newspapers.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n===Technology===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-85461-0005, Berlin, Mauerbau, NVA-Panzersoldaten.jpg|thumb|upright|Soldiers in an [[East Germany|East German]] tank unit reading about the erection of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1961 in the newspaper [[Neues Deutschland]]]]\n\n====Print====\nFor centuries newspapers were printed on paper and supplied physically to readers either by local distribution, or in some cases by mail, for example for British expatriates living in India or Hong Kong who subscribed to British newspapers. Newspapers can be delivered to subscribers homes and/or businesses by a paper's own delivery people, sent via the [[mail]], sold at [[newsstand]]s, [[grocery store]]s and [[convenience store]]s, and delivered to [[library|libraries]] and [[bookstore]]s. Newspaper organizations need a large distribution system to deliver their papers to these different distributors, which typically involves delivery trucks and delivery people.\nIn recent years, newspapers and other media have adapted to the changing technology environment by starting to offer online editions to cater to the needs of the public. In the future, the trend towards more electronic delivery of the news will continue with more emphasis on the Internet, social media and other electronic delivery methods. However, while the method of delivery is changing, the newspaper and the industry still has a niche in the world.\n\n====Online====\n{{Main|Online newspaper}}\nAs of 2007, virtually all major printed newspapers have online editions distributed over the Internet which, depending on the country may be regulated by journalism organizations such as the [[Press Complaints Commission]] in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.journalism.co.uk/news/story3152.shtml|title=Journalism Magazine|publisher=Journalism.co.uk|date=19 January 2007|accessdate=21 February 2012}}</ref> But as some publishers find their print-based models increasingly unsustainable,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2017/jan/24/winning-back-advertisers-is-key-to-saving-the-newspaper-industry|title=Guardian News and Media Limited|publisher=theguardian.com|date=24 January 2017|accessdate=24 January 2017}}</ref> Web-based \"newspapers\" have also started to appear, such as the ''[[Southport Reporter]]'' in the UK and the ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'', which stopped publishing in print after 149 years in March 2009 and became an online-only paper.\n\nSince 2005 in the UK more than 200 regional newspapers have closed down resulting in 50% decline in the number of regional journalists. A 2016 study done by King's College London found that the towns which lost their local newspapers receded from the democratic values and experienced the loss of public faith in the authorities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-43106436|title=The death of the local newspaper?|last=|first=|date=20 February 2018|website=BBC|access-date=24 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nA new trend in newspaper publishing is the introduction of [[personalization]] through [[on-demand printing]] technologies or with online news aggregator websites like [[Google news]]. Customized newspapers allow the reader to create their individual newspaper through the selection of individual pages from multiple publications. This \"Best of\" approach allows revival of the print-based model and opens up a new distribution channel to increase coverage beneath the usual boundaries of distribution. Customized newspapers online have been offered by MyYahoo, I-Google, CRAYON, ICurrent.com, Kibboko.com, Twitter. times and many others. With these online newspapers, the reader can select how much of each section (politics, sports, arts, etc.) they wish to see in their news.\n\n==Organization and personnel==\n[[File:Gazeta Lubuska newsroom.jpg|thumb|left|The newsroom of Gazeta Lubuska in [[Zielona G\u00f3ra]], Poland]]\nIn the United States, the overall manager or chief executive of the newspaper is the publisher.<ref>{{cite web|title=Career Guide to Industries, 2010\u201311 Edition: Publishing, Except Software|url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/cg/cgs013.htm|publisher=U.S. Department of Labor|author=Bureau of Labor Statistics|date=17 December 2009|accessdate=28 May 2010}}</ref> In small newspapers, the owner of the publication (or the largest shareholder in the corporation that owns the publication) is usually the publisher. Although he or she rarely or perhaps never writes stories, the publisher is legally responsible for the contents of the entire newspaper and also runs the business, including hiring editors, reporters, and other staff members. This title is less common outside the U.S. The equivalent position in the film industry and television news shows is the executive producer.{{citation needed|date=May 2010}} Most newspapers have four main departments devoted to publishing the newspaper itself\u2014editorial, production/printing, circulation, and advertising, although they are frequently referred to by a variety of other names\u2014as well as the non-newspaper-specific departments also found in other businesses of comparable size, such as accounting, marketing, human resources, and IT.\n\nThroughout the English-speaking world, the person who selects the content for the newspaper is usually referred to as the editor. Variations on this title such as editor-in-chief, executive editor, and so on are common. For small newspapers, a single editor may be responsible for all content areas. At large newspapers, the most senior editor is in overall charge of the publication, while less senior editors may each focus on one subject area, such as local news or sports. These divisions are called [[news bureau]]s or \"desks\", and each is supervised by a designated editor. Most newspaper editors [[copy edit]] the stories for their part of the newspaper, but they may share their workload with [[proofreader]]s and [[fact checker]]s.\n[[File:Newsboy in 1905.jpg|thumb|A [[Newspaper delivery|newsboy]] in 1905 selling the ''[[Toronto Telegram]]'' in Canada]]\n\n[[Reporter]]s are journalists who primarily report facts that they have gathered and those who write longer, less news-oriented articles may be called feature writers. Photographers and [[graphic artist]]s provide images and illustrations to support articles. Journalists often specialize in a subject area, called a [[Beat reporting|beat]], such as sports, religion, or science. Columnists are journalists who write regular articles recounting their personal opinions and experiences. [[Printer (publishing)|Printers]] and press operators physically print the newspaper. Printing is outsourced by many newspapers, partly because of the cost of an [[Offset printing|offset web press]] (the most common kind of press used to print newspapers) and also because a small newspaper's [[print run]] might require less than an hour of operation, meaning that if the newspaper had its own press it would sit idle most of the time. If the newspaper offers information online, [[webmaster]]s and [[web designer]]s may be employed to upload stories to the newspaper's website.\n\nThe staff of the [[Newspaper circulation|circulation department]] liaise with retailers who sell the newspaper; sell subscriptions; and supervise distribution of the printed newspapers through the mail, by [[newspaper carrier]]s, at retailers, and through vending machines. [[Free newspapers]] do not sell subscriptions, but they still have a circulation department responsible for distributing the newspapers. Sales staff in the advertising department not only sell ad space to clients such as local businesses, but also help clients design and plan their advertising campaigns. Other members of the advertising department may include [[graphic designer]]s, who design ads according to the customers' specifications and the department's policies. In an [[Advertising-free media|advertising-free newspaper]], there is no advertising department.\n\n==Zoned and other editions==\n[[File:Newspapers.jpg|thumb|Israeli daily newspaper ''[[Haaretz]]'', seen in its [[Hebrew]] and English language editions]]\nNewspapers often refine distribution of ads and news through zoning and editioning. Zoning occurs when advertising and editorial content change to reflect the location to which the product is delivered. The editorial content often may change merely to reflect changes in advertising\u2014the quantity and layout of which affects the space available for editorial\u2014or may contain region-specific news. In rare instances, the advertising may not change from one zone to another, but there will be different region-specific editorial content. As the content can vary widely, zoned editions are often produced in parallel. Editioning occurs in the main sections as news is updated throughout the night. The advertising is usually the same in each edition (with the exception of zoned regionals, in which it is often the 'B' section of local news that undergoes advertising changes). As each edition represents the latest news available for the next press run, these editions are produced linearly, with one completed edition being copied and updated for the next edition. The previous edition is always copied to maintain a Newspaper of Record and to fall back on if a quick correction is needed for the press.

Since the 1980s, the newspaper industry has largely moved away from lower-quality [[letterpress printing]] to higher-quality, [[CMYK color model|four-color process]], [[offset printing]]. In addition, desktop computers, [[word processor|word processing software]], [[graphics software]], [[digital camera]]s and digital [[prepress]] and [[typesetting]] technologies have revolutionized the newspaper production process. These technologies have enabled newspapers to publish color photographs and graphics, as well as innovative [[Page layout|layouts]] and better design.\n\nTo help their titles stand out on newsstands, some newspapers are printed on coloured newsprint. For example, the ''[[Financial Times]]'' is printed on a distinctive salmon pink paper, and [[Sheffield]]'s weekly sports publication derives its name, the ''[[Green Un|Green 'Un]]'', from the traditional colour of its paper. The Italian sports newspaper ''[[La Gazzetta dello Sport]]'' is also printed on pink paper while ''[[L'\u00c9quipe]]'' (formerly ''L'Auto'') is printed on yellow paper. Both the latter promoted major cycling races and their newsprint colours were reflected in the colours of the jerseys used to denote the race leader; for example the leader in the [[Giro d'Italia]] wears a pink jersey.\n\n==Circulation and readership==\n{{Main|List of newspapers in the World by circulation|Newspaper circulation|Ageing of newspaper readership}}\n[[File:Newspaper vendor.jpg|thumb|left|Newspaper vendor, [[Paddington]], London, February 2005]]\nThe number of copies distributed, either on an average day or on particular days (typically Sunday), is called the newspaper's circulation and is one of the principal factors used to set advertising rates. Circulation is not necessarily the same as copies sold, since some copies or newspapers are distributed without cost. Readership figures may be higher than circulation figures because many copies are read by more than one person, although this is offset by the number of copies distributed but not read (especially for those distributed free). In the United States, the [[Alliance for Audited Media]] maintains historical and current data on average circulation of daily and weekly newspapers and other periodicals.\n\nAccording to the ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]'', the daily circulation of the Soviet newspaper ''[[Trud (Russian newspaper)|Trud]]'' exceeded 21,500,000 in 1990, while the Soviet weekly ''[[Argumenty i Fakty]]'' boasted a circulation of 33,500,000 in 1991. According to United Nations data from 1995 Japan has three daily papers\u2014the ''[[Yomiuri Shimbun]]'', ''[[Asahi Shimbun]]'', and ''[[Mainichi Shimbun]]''\u2014with circulations well above 5.5&nbsp;million. Germany's ''[[Bild-Zeitung|Bild]]'', with a circulation of 3.8&nbsp;million, was the only other paper in that category. In the United Kingdom, ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' is the top seller, with around 3.24&nbsp;million copies distributed daily. In the U.S., ''The Wall Street Journal'' has a daily circulation of approximately 2.02&nbsp;million, making it the most widely distributed paper in the country.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2010138873_apusnewspapercirculation.html|title=Newspaper circulation drop accelerates April\u2013Sept|author=Liedtke, Michael|newspaper=The Seattle Times|date=26 October 2009|accessdate=26 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nWhile paid readership of print newspapers has been steadily declining in the developed [[OECD]] nations, it has been rising in the chief developing nations (Brazil, India, Indonesia, China and South Africa), whose paid daily circulation exceeded those of the developed nations for the first time in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/30/24/45559596.pdf|title=The evolution of news and the internet|author=OECD Working Party on the Information Economy|date=11 June 2010|accessdate=14 July 2011}}\"Growth in the BIICS countries by about 35% from 2000 to 2008 very much contributed to this growth, most notably India with a 45% increase in circulation between 2000 and 2008, South Africa (34%) and China (an estimated 29%).

In the 1920s, on a national basis in the U.S., daily newspapers achieved market penetration of 123 percent (meaning the average U.S. household received 1.23 newspapers). As other media began to compete with newspapers, and as printing became easier and less expensive giving rise to a greater diversity of publications, market penetration began to decline. It wasn't until the early 1970s, however, that market penetration dipped below 100 percent. By 2000, it was 53 percent and still falling.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stateofthemedia.org/2004/newspapers-intro/audience/|title=Newspapers: Audience&nbsp;\u2013 State of the Media 2004|access-date=27 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170828204802/http://www.stateofthemedia.org/2004/newspapers-intro/audience/|archive-date=28 August 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> Many paid-for newspapers offer a variety of subscription plans. For example, someone might want only a Sunday paper, or perhaps only Sunday and Saturday, or maybe only a [[workweek]] subscription, or perhaps a daily subscription. Most newspapers provide some or all of their content on the Internet, either at no cost or for a fee. In some cases, free access is available only for a matter of days or weeks, or for a certain number of viewed articles, after which readers must register and provide personal data. In other cases, free archives are provided.\n\n==Advertising==\n[[File:C & A Speciale Mantel-Aanbieding.jpg|thumb|1938 Dutch newspaper advertisement for women's clothing sold at [[C&A]] stores]]\nA newspaper typically generates 70\u201380% of its revenue from advertising, and the remainder from sales and subscriptions.<ref name=\"business_model_1996\">{{cite news\n|url=https://www.academia.edu/4894990\n|title=Online Revenue Business Model Has Changed Little Since 1996|publisher=[[Newspaper Research Journal]]|author=Mensing, Donica|date=Spring 2007}}</ref> The portion of the newspaper that is not advertising is called ''editorial content'', ''editorial matter'', or simply ''editorial'', although the last term is also used to refer specifically to those articles in which the newspaper and its guest writers express their opinions. (This distinction, however, developed over time&nbsp;\u2013 early publishers like Girardin (France) and Zang (Austria) did not always distinguish paid items from editorial content.). The [[business model]] of having advertising subsidize the cost of printing and distributing newspapers (and, it is always hoped, the making of a profit) rather than having subscribers cover the full cost was first done, it seems, in 1833 by ''[[The Sun (New York)|The Sun]]'', a daily paper that was published in New York City. Rather than charging 6 cents per copy, the price of a typical New York daily at the time, they charged 1-cent, and depended on advertising to make up the difference.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/18904178|title=Reinventing the newspaper|date=7 July 2011|accessdate=13 July 2011|work=The Economist}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Naa newspaper ad revenue.svg|thumb|US Newspaper Advertising Revenue -  ''Newspaper Association of America published data''<ref name=NAAdata>{{cite web|title=Trends & Numbers |date=14 March 2012 |publisher=[[Newspaper Association of America]] |accessdate=18 September 2012 |url=http://www.naa.org/Trends-and-Numbers/Advertising-Expenditures/Annual-All-Categories.aspx |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918094825/http://www.naa.org/Trends-and-Numbers/Advertising-Expenditures/Annual-All-Categories.aspx |archivedate=18 September 2012 }}</ref>]]\n\nNewspapers in countries with easy access to the [[World Wide Web|web]] have been hurt by the decline of many traditional advertisers. Department stores and supermarkets could be relied upon in the past to buy pages of newspaper advertisements, but due to industry consolidation are much less likely to do so now.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wallstreetcosmos.com/newspaper_iindustry_report.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080321044034/http://www.wallstreetcosmos.com/newspaper_iindustry_report.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=21 March 2008|title=wallstreetcosmos.com|publisher=wallstreetcosmos.com|accessdate=21 October 2012}}</ref> Additionally, newspapers are seeing traditional advertisers shift to new media platforms. The classified category is shifting to sites including [[Craigslist]], employment websites, and auto sites. National advertisers are shifting to many types of digital content including websites, rich media platforms, and mobile.\n\nIn recent years, the [[advertorial]] emerged. Advertorials are most commonly recognized as an [[Editorial|opposite-editorial]] which third parties pay a fee to have included in the paper. [[Advertorial]]s commonly advertise new products or techniques, such as a new design for golf equipment, a new form of laser surgery, or weight-loss drugs. The tone is usually closer to that of a [[press release]] than of an objective [[news story]]. Such articles are often clearly distinguished from editorial content through either the design and layout of the page or with a label declaring the article as an advertisement. However, there has been growing concern over the blurring of the line between editorial and advertorial content.<ref>{{Cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/may/16/blurring-lines-between-advertising-and-editorial|title = Dangerous blend: how lines between editorial and advertising are blurring|last = Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric|first = Filloux|date = 16 May 2011|work = The Guardian|accessdate = 5 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Journalism==\n{{Main|Journalism}}\n[[File:Severnyi krai.jpg|thumb|The editorial staff of newspaper \"Severnyi Kray\" in [[Yaroslavl]], Russia in 1900]]\nSince newspapers began as a journal (record of current events), the profession involved in the making of newspapers began to be called ''journalism''. In the [[yellow journalism]] era of the 19th century, many newspapers in the United States relied on sensational stories that were meant to anger or excite the public, rather than to inform. The restrained style of reporting that relies on fact checking and accuracy regained popularity around [[World War II]]. Criticism of journalism is varied and sometimes vehement. Credibility is questioned because of anonymous sources; errors in facts, spelling, and grammar; real or perceived [[bias]]; and scandals involving [[plagiarism]] and fabrication.\n\nIn the past, newspapers have often been owned by so-called [[press baron]]s, and were used for gaining a political voice. After 1920 most major newspapers became parts of chains run by large media corporations such as [[Gannett]], [[The McClatchy Company]], [[Hearst Corporation]], [[Cox Enterprises]], [[Landmark Media Enterprises LLC]], [[Morris Communications]], [[Tribune Company|The Tribune Company]], [[Hollinger Inc.|Hollinger International]], [[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]], [[Swift Communications]], etc. Newspapers have, in the modern world, played an important role in the exercise of freedom of expression. Whistle-blowers, and those who \"leak\" stories of corruption in political circles often choose to inform newspapers before other mediums of communication, relying on the perceived willingness of newspaper editors to expose the secrets and lies of those who would rather cover them. However, there have been many circumstances of the political autonomy of newspapers being curtailed. Recent research has examined the effects of a newspaper's closing on the reelection of incumbents, voter turnout, and campaign spending.<ref>[https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/wp/wp686.pdf Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, ''Do Newspapers Matter?'', 2011]</ref>\n\nOpinions of other writers and readers are expressed in the ''[[op-ed]]'' (\"opposite the editorial page\") and [[letter to the editor|''letters to the editors'']] sections of the paper. Some ways newspapers have tried to improve their credibility are: appointing [[ombudsman|ombudsmen]], developing ethics policies and training, using more stringent corrections policies, communicating their processes and rationale with readers, and asking sources to review articles after publication.\n\n==Impact of television and Internet==\n{{Main|Decline of newspapers}}\n{{Further|Online newspapers}}\n[[File:2010 newspaper press France 5125942563.jpg|thumb|upright|Newspaper press in [[Limoges]], France]]\nBy the late 1990s, the availability of news via 24-hour television channels and the subsequent availability of [[online journalism]] posed an ongoing challenge to the business model of most newspapers in developed countries. Paid [[newspaper circulation]] has declined, while advertising revenue\u2014the bulk of most newspapers' income\u2014has been shifting from print to [[social media]] and news websites, resulting in a general decline. One of the challenges is that a number of online news websites are free to access. Other online news sites have a [[paywall]] and require paid subscription for access. In less-developed countries, cheaper printing and distribution, increased literacy, a growing middle class, and other factors have compensated for the emergence of electronic media, and newspaper circulation continues to grow.<ref>N.

Subrahmanya Sastri worked as a teacher having entered the educational service. His mother Mahalakshmi, was also a [[Telugu Brahmin]] who belonged to the village of Icchangudi near Tiruvaiyaru.\n\nSwaminathan was the second child of his parents.<ref name=\":0\" /> Sadasiva Sastri was born on 3 October 1903 in Viluppuram, South Arcot District, [[Tamil Nadu]]. [[Swaminathan Sivaram|Swaminathan's]] [[Upanayana|upanayanam]] was performed in [[Tindivanam]] in 1905 and during his brought up, he was well versed with the [[Vedas]] and start doing poojas at his early stage of his life. In 1906, the Sixty-sixth Acharya of Kamakoti Pitha, Sri Chandrasekharendra Saraswati was camping in [[Perumukkal]], a small village near [[Tindivanam]] in observance of the [[Chaturmas|Chaturmasya vrata]]. Subrahmanya Sastri went to take the blessings of the Acharya at that time. The Sixty-sixth Acharya attained Siddhi at [[Kalavai]] and Swaminathan's maternal cousin was installed as the sixty-seventh [[Acharya]]. The sixty seventh Acharya had a fever and due to the unexpected turn of events, Swaminathan was installed as the Acharya. Swaminathan ascended the [[Kanchi Kamakoti Peetham]] on 13 February 1907 as the sixty eighth Acharya with the [[Sannyasa]] name Chandrasekhara Saraswati. As per the usual training given to the seers, he was well trained with the Vedas, puranas, various hindu texts and ancient Indian literature. The Acharya was fifteen years old in 1909. For two years, he studied under the pandits of the [[Matha]] at [[Kumbakonam]]. Then from 1911 to 1914 he studied in Mahendramangalam, in a tiny village on the Northern bank of Akhanda Kaveri. The Acharya showed interest in subjects such as photography, mathematics and astronomy as well. He returned to Kumbakonam in 1914.  The Matha was managed by the Court of Wards from 1911-1915 until he turned twenty one in May 1915.\n\n== Contributions ==\n\nHe started spreading his knowledge through spiritual journeys across the Indian spiritual hinterland. Through his intense devotional practices like the daily rituals such as Sandhyavandhanam, Shri Chandramouleeshwara Pooja, Shri Panchadhanya Pooja, Shri Kamakshi Amman Pooja & recital of the vedas, made him popular across countries & continents. Iyengars (who were not part of the mutt), various sub castes and Muslims & Christians became his devotees. Devotees realized he was not a normal person and found out him as a 'Jagadguru', through his practices and rectifying their issues. Mahaperiyava dedicated his life to the primary deity in the premises of Shri [[Kamakshi Amman temple]], where goddess himself came there for her devotion to Lord Shiva. He carried the responsibility and made it a simple practice to increase devotion by chanting & writing the holy name \"Rama Rama\" which became a religious movement. Devotees came across different origin to give salutations for his holy feet. Populous speeches made Presidents & heads of different states/organisations/associations to be in his path of spirituality. Throughout his life he practiced Advaitha phiosophy of his guru, [[Adi Shankara]], the great hindu philospoher and reformist.

His 99th birthday celebrations were celebrated by Shri Jayendrar and Shri Vijayendrar as a huge event. He passed away without celebrating his centenary on 8 January 1994.

During the journey the maistry hinted to me that I might not return home and that the rest of my life might be spent in the Mutt itself. At first I thought that my elder cousin having become the Head of the Mutt, it was his wish that I should live with him. But the maistry gradually clarified matters as the cart rolled on. The Acharya had fever which developed into delirium and that was why I was being separated from the family to be taken to Kalavai\u2026 I was stunned by this unexpected turn of events.

The field is considered a subset of [[visual communication]] and [[communication design]], but sometimes the term \"graphic [[design]]\" is used synonymously. Graphic designers create and combine symbols, images and text to form visual representations of ideas and messages. They use [[typography]], [[visual arts]], and [[page layout]] techniques to create [[Composition (visual arts)|visual compositions]]. Common applications of graphic design include [[corporate design]] (logos and branding), editorial design (magazines, newspapers and books), [[wayfinding|wayfinding or environmental design]], [[advertising]], [[web design]], [[communication design]], product [[Packaging and labeling|packaging]], and [[signage]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main article|History of graphic design}}\nThe term graphic design was coined by [[William Addison Dwiggins]] in 1922.<ref>Drucker, Johanna and McVarish, Emily, 'Graphic Design History: A critical Guide'. [[Pearson Education]], 2009</ref> However, the origins of graphic design can be traced from the origins of human existence, from the caves of [[Lascaux]], to Rome's [[Trajan's Column]] to the [[illuminated manuscript]]s of the Middle Ages, to the neon lights of [[Ginza]], [[Tokyo]]. In \"Babylon, artisans pressed cuneiform inscriptions into clay bricks or tablets which were used for construction. The bricks gave information such as the name of the reigning monarch, the builder, or some other dignitary\".<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title = Advertising In America|last = Ulanoff|first = Stanley M.|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = }}</ref> This was the first known road sign announcing the name of the governor of a state or mayor of the city. The Egyptians developed communication by hieroglyphics that used picture symbols dating as far back as 136 B.C. found on the [[Rosetta Stone]]. \"The Rosetta stone, found by one of Napoleon's engineers was an advertisement for the Egyptian ruler, Ptolemy as the \"true Son of the Sun, the Father of the Moon, and the Keeper of the Happiness of Men\"\" <ref name=\":0\"/> The Egyptians also invented [[papyrus]], paper made from reeds found along the [[Nile]], on which they transcribed advertisements more common among their people at the time. During the \"[[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]\", from 500 <small>AD</small> to 1450 <small>AD</small>, monks created elaborate, illustrated manuscripts.\n\nIn both its lengthy history and in the relatively recent explosion of [[visual communication]] in the 20th and 21st centuries, the distinction between [[advertising]], art, graphic design and [[fine art]] has disappeared. They share many elements, theories, principles, practices, [[language]]s and sometimes the same benefactor or client. In advertising, the ultimate objective is the sale of goods and services. In graphic design, \"the essence is to give order to information, form to ideas, expression, and feeling to artifacts that document human experience.\"<ref>Meggs, Philip B., 'A history of graphic design'. New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1983</ref>\n\nGraphic design in the United States began with [[Benjamin Franklin]] who used his newspaper ''[[Pennsylvania Gazette|The Pennsylvania Gazette]]'', to master the art of publicity to promote his own books and to influence the masses. \"Benjamin Franklin's ingenuity gained in strength as did his cunning and in 1737 he had replaced his counterpart in Pennsylvania, [[Andrew Bradford]] as postmaster and printer after a competition he instituted and won. He showed his prowess by running an ad in his ''General Magazine and the Historical Chronicle of British Plantations in America'' (the precursor to the [[The Saturday Evening Post|Saturday Evening Post]]) that stressed the benefits offered by a stove he invented, named the ''Pennsylvania Fireplace''. His invention is still sold today and is known as ''the [[Franklin stove]]''. \"<ref name=\":1\">Advertising Age. How It Was In Advertising: 1776-1976. Chicago, Illinois: Crain Books, 1976.</ref>\n\nAmerican advertising initially imitated British newspapers and magazines. Advertisements were printed in scrambled type and uneven lines that made it difficult to read. Franklin better organized this by adding 14-point type for the first line of the advertisement; although later shortened and centered it, making \"headlines\". Franklin added illustrations, something that London printers had not attempted. Franklin was the first to utilize [[logo]]s, which were early symbols that announced such services as opticians by displaying golden spectacles. Franklin taught advertisers that the use of detail was important in marketing their products. Some advertisements ran for 10-20 lines, including color, names, varieties, and sizes of the goods that were offered.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n===The advent of printing===\n{{Main article|History of printing}}\nDuring the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618\u2013907) wood blocks were cut to print on textiles and later to reproduce Buddhist texts. A Buddhist scripture printed in 868 is the earliest known printed book. Beginning in the 11th century, longer scrolls and books were produced using [[movable type]] printing, making books widely available during the [[Song dynasty]] (960\u20131279).<ref>\" Printing\" The Silk Road Foundation. Retrieved May 31, 2008. [http://www.silk-road.com/artl/printing.shtml Silk-road.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509141910/http://www.silk-road.com/artl/printing.shtml |date=2008-05-09 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the 17th-18th century movable type was used for handbills or trade cards which were printed from wood or copper engravings. These documents announced a business and its location. English painter [[William Hogarth]] used his skill in engraving was one of the first to design for business trade.\n\nIn Mainz Germany, in 1448, [[Johann Gutenberg]] <nowiki/>introduced movable type using a new metal alloy for use in a [[printing press]] and opened a new era of commerce. This made graphics more readily available since mass printing dropped the price of printing material significantly. Previously, most advertising was word of mouth. In France and England, for example, [[Town crier|criers]] announced products for sale just as [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]] had done.\n\nThe printing press made books more widely available. [[Aldus Manutius]] developed the book structure that became the foundation of western publication design. This era of graphic design is called [[Renaissance Humanism|Humanist]] or Old Style. Additionally, [[William Caxton]], England's first printer produced religious books, but had trouble selling them. He discovered the use of leftover pages and used them to announce the books and post them on church doors. This practice was termed ''\"squis\"'' or ''\"pin up\" posters,'' in approximately 1612, becoming the first form of print advertising in Europe''.'' The term ''Siquis'' came from the [[Roman era]] when public notices were posted stating ''\"if anybody...\"'', which in Latin is ''\"si quis\"''. These printed announcements were followed by later public registers of ''wants'' called ''want ads'' and in some areas such as the first periodical in Paris advertising was termed \"advices\". The \"Advices\" were what we know today as ''want ad media'' or ''advice columns''.\n\nIn 1638 [[Harvard University]] received a printing press from England. More than 52 years passed before London bookseller [[Benjamin Harris (publisher)|Benjamin Harris]] received another printing press in Boston. Harris published a newspaper in serial form, ''[[Publick Occurrences Both Forreign and Domestick|Publick Occurrences Both Foreign and Domestick]]''. It was four pages long and suppressed by the government after its first edition.\n\nJohn Campbell is credited for the first newspaper, the ''[[The Boston News-Letter|Boston News-Letter]]'', which appeared in 1704. The paper was known during the revolution as ''\"Weeklies\"''. The name came from the 13 hours required for the ink to dry on each side of the paper. The solution was to first, print the ads and then to print the news on the other side the day before publication. The paper was four pages long having ads on at least 20%-30% of the total paper, (pages one and four) the hot news was located on the inside.<ref name=\":1\" /> The initial use of the ''Boston News-Letter'' carried Campbell's own solicitations for advertising from his readers. Campbell's first paid advertisement was in his third edition, May 7 or 8th,  1704. Two of the first ads were for stolen anvils. The third was for real estate in [[Oyster Bay (town), New York|Oyster Bay]], owned by [[William Bradford (Colonial printer)|William Bradford]], a pioneer printer in New York, and the first to sell something of value. Bradford published his first newspaper in 1725, New York's first, the ''[[New-York Gazette]]''. Bradford's son preceded him in Philadelphia publishing the ''[[Andrew Bradford|American Weekly Mercury]]'', 1719. ''The Mercury'' and William Brooker's ''Massachusetts Gazette'', first published a day earlier.\n\n===Design industry===\nIn late 19th-century Europe, especially in the United Kingdom, the first official publication of a printed design was released, marking the separation of graphic design from fine art.\n\nIn 1849, [[Henry Cole]] became one of the major forces in [[design education]] in Great Britain, informing the government of the importance of design in his ''Journal of Design and Manufactures''. He organized the [[Great Exhibition]] as a celebration of modern industrial technology and Victorian design.\n\nFrom 1891 to 1896, [[William Morris]]' Kelmscott Press published some of the most significant of the graphic design products of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], and made a lucrative business of creating and selling stylish books. Morris created a market for works of graphic design in their own right and a profession for this new type of art. The Kelmscott Press is characterized by an obsession with historical styles. This historicism was the first significant reaction to the state of nineteenth-century graphic design. Morris' work, along with the rest of the [[Private Press]] movement, directly influenced [[Art Nouveau]].<ref name=mccarthy>Fiona McCarthy, ''William Morris'', London: Faber and Faber, 1996 {{ISBN|0-571-17495-7}}</ref>\n\n===Twentieth century design===\n[[File:VC-25(040616-F-5677R-002).jpg|thumb|right|A Boeing 747 aircraft with [[livery]] designating it as [[Air Force One]].

The spread of the German [[Bauhaus]] school of design to Chicago in 1937 brought a \"mass-produced\" minimalism to America; sparking \"modern\" [[architecture]] and design. Notable names in mid-century modern design include [[Adrian Frutiger]], designer of the [[typeface]]s [[Univers]] and [[Frutiger (typeface)|Frutiger]]; [[Paul Rand]], who took the principles of the Bauhaus and applied them to popular advertising and logo design, helping to create a uniquely American approach to European minimalism while becoming one of the principal pioneers of the subset of graphic design known as [[corporate identity]]; [[Alex Steinweiss]], credited with the invention of the album cover; and [[Josef M\u00fcller-Brockmann]], who designed posters in a severe yet accessible manner typical of the 1950s and 1970s era.\n\nThe professional graphic design industry grew in parallel with [[consumerism]]. This raised concerns and criticisms, notably from within the graphic design community with the [[First Things First 1964 manifesto|First Things First manifesto]].

It is applied to products and elements of company identity such as [[logo]]s, colors, [[packaging]] and text as part of [[brand]]ing (see also [[advertising]]). Branding has become increasingly more important in the range of services offered by graphic designers. Graphic designers often form part of a branding team.\n\nGraphic design is applied in the [[entertainment]] industry in decoration, scenery and visual story telling. Other examples of design for entertainment purposes include novels, vinyl [[album cover]]s, comic books, DVD covers, [[opening credits]] and [[closing credits]] in [[filmmaking]], and programs and props on stage. This could also include artwork used for T-shirts and other items screenprinted for sale.\n\nFrom scientific journals to news reporting, the presentation of opinion and facts is often improved with graphics and thoughtful compositions of visual information - known as [[information design]]. Newspapers, magazines, blogs, television and film documentaries may use graphic design. With the advent of the web, information designers with experience in interactive tools are increasingly used to illustrate the background to news stories. Information design can include [[data visualization]], which involves using programs to interpret and form data into a visually compelling presentation, and can be tied in with [[information graphics]].\n\n==Skills==\nA graphic design project may involve the stylization and presentation of existing [[writing|text]] and either preexisting [[image]]ry or images developed by the graphic designer. Elements can be incorporated in both traditional and digital form, which involves the use of visual arts, typography, and page layout techniques. Graphic designers organize pages and optionally add graphic elements. Graphic designers can commission photographers or illustrators to create original pieces. Designers use digital tools, often referred to as [[interactive design]], or [[multimedia]] design. Designers need communication skills to convince an audience and sell their designs.\n\nThe \"process school\" is concerned with communication; it highlights the channels and media through which messages are transmitted and by which senders and receivers encode and decode these messages. The semiotic school treats a message as a construction of signs which through interaction with receivers, produces meaning; communication as an agent.\n\n===Typography===\n{{Main article|Typography}}\n\nTypography includes type design, modifying type [[glyphs]] and arranging type. Type glyphs (characters) are created and modified using illustration techniques. Type arrangement is the selection of typefaces, point size, tracking (the space between all characters used), kerning (the space between two specific characters) and leading (line spacing).\n\nTypography is performed by typesetters, compositors, typographers, graphic artists, art directors, and clerical workers. Until the digital age, typography was a specialized occupation. Certain fonts communicate or resemble stereotypical notions. For example, 1942 Report is a font which types text akin to a typewriter or a vintage report.<ref>Butterick, Matthew. \"Butterick's Practical Typography.\" Butterick's Practical Typography. Jones McClure, 2010-14. Web. 17 Feb. 2015.</ref>\n\n===Page layout===\n{{Main article|Page layout}}\n[[File:Golden section in book design.svg|thumb|Golden section in book design]]\nPage layout deals with the arrangement of elements (content) on a page, such as image placement, text layout and style. Page design has always been a consideration in printed material and more recently extended to displays such as web pages. Elements typically consist of [[typography|type]] (text), [[image]]s (pictures), and (with print media) occasionally place-holder graphics such as a [[dieline]] for elements that are not printed with ink such as [[Die (manufacturing)|die]]/[[laser cutting]], [[foil stamping]] or [[Embossing (paper)|blind embossing]].\n\n===Printmaking===\n{{Main article|Printmaking}}\n\nPrintmaking is the process of making artworks by printing on [[paper]] and other materials or surfaces. The process is capable of producing multiples of the same work, each called a print. Each print is an original, technically known as an impression. Prints are created from a single original surface, technically a matrix. Common types of matrices include: plates of metal, usually copper or zinc for engraving or etching; stone, used for lithography; blocks of wood for woodcuts, linoleum for linocuts and fabric plates for screen-printing. Works printed from a single plate create an edition, in modern times usually each signed and numbered to form a limited edition. Prints may be published in book form, as artist's books. A single print could be the product of one or multiple techniques.[[Image:Pencils hb.jpg|thumb|The [[pencil]] is one of the most basic graphic design tools.]]\n\nAside from technology, graphic design requires [[judgment]] and [[creativity]]. Critical, observational, quantitative and analytic thinking are required for design layouts and [[artistic rendering|rendering]]. If the executor is merely following a solution (e.g. sketch, script or instructions) provided by another designer (such as an [[art director]]), then the executor is not usually considered the designer.\n\n=== Strategy ===\n[[Strategy]] is becoming more and more essential to effective graphic design. The main distinction between graphic design and [[art]] is that graphic design solves a problem as well as being aesthetically pleasing. This balance is where strategy comes in. It is important for a graphic designer to understand their clients' needs, as well as the needs of the people who will be interacting with the design. It is the designer's job to combine business and creative objectives to elevate the design beyond purely [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] means.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.howdesign.com/how-magazine/how-march-2013/understanding-design-strategy/|title=Understanding Design Strategy: Effective Graphic Design for Clients|last=Stone|first=Terry Lee|date=2013-02-22|website=HOW Design|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-22}}</ref>\n\n== Tools ==\nThe method of presentation (e.g. Arrangements, style, medium) is important to the design. The development and presentation tools can change how an audience perceives a project. The image or layout is produced using [[media (arts)|traditional media]] and [[technical drawing tools|guides]], or [[digital image editing]] tools on computers. Tools in [[computer graphics]] often take on traditional names such as \"scissors\" or \"[[pen]]\". Some graphic design tools such as a [[Grid (graphic design)|grid]] are used in both traditional and digital form.\n\nIn the mid-1980s [[desktop publishing]] and [[graphic art software]] applications introduced computer image manipulation and creation capabilities that had previously been manually executed. Computers enabled designers to instantly see the effects of layout or typographic changes, and to simulate the effects of traditional media. Traditional tools such as [[pencil]]s can be useful even when computers are used for finalization; a designer or art director may sketch numerous concepts as part of the [[creative process]].<ref>Jacci Howard Bear, [http://desktoppub.about.com/cs/basic/a/thumbnails.htm?terms=squiggle desktoppub.about.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206171848/http://desktoppub.about.com/cs/basic/a/thumbnails.htm?terms=squiggle |date=2013-12-06 }} Retrieved 2008-03-19</ref> Styluses can be used with tablet computers to capture hand drawings digitally.<ref>[http://vimeo.com/6986303 Milton Glaser Draws & Lectures] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140321100020/http://vimeo.com/6986303 |date=2014-03-21 }}. retrieved 31-01-2011</ref>\n\n===Computers and software===\nDesigners disagree whether computers enhance the creative process.<ref>[http://www.designtalkboard.com/designtalk/index.php/topic,1030.0.html Designtalkboard.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629214914/http://www.designtalkboard.com/designtalk/index.php/topic,1030.0.html |date=2007-06-29 }}, topic 1030 and [http://www.designtalkboard.com/designtalk/index.php/topic,1441.msg6356.html#msg6356 Designtalkboard.com], topic 1141. retrieved 3-18-2007</ref> Some designers argue that computers allow them to explore multiple ideas quickly and in more detail than can be achieved by hand-rendering or [[paste up|paste-up]].<ref>Jann Lawrence Pollard and Jerry James Little, ''Creative Computer Tools for Artists: Using Software to Develop Drawings and Paintings,'' November 2001 Introduction</ref> While other designers find the limitless choices from digital design can lead to paralysis or endless iterations with no clear outcome.\n\nMost designers use a hybrid process that combines traditional and computer-based technologies. First, hand-rendered [[Comprehensive layout|layouts]] are used to get approval to execute an idea, then the polished visual product is produced on a computer.\n\nGraphic designers are expected to be proficient in software programs for image-making, typography and layout. Nearly all of the popular and \"industry standard\" software programs used by graphic designers since the early 1990s are products of [[Adobe Systems]] Incorporated. [[Adobe Photoshop]] (a [[Raster scan|raster]]-based program for photo editing) and [[Adobe Illustrator]] (a vector-based program for drawing) are often used in the final stage. Designers often use pre-designed [[Raster graphics|raster images]] and [[vector graphics]] in their work from online design databases. Raster images may be edited in Adobe Photoshop, logos and illustrations in Adobe Illustrator, and the final product assembled in one of the major page layout programs, such as [[Adobe InDesign]], [[PagePlus|Serif PagePlus]] and [[QuarkXPress|QuarkXpress]]. Powerful open-source programs (which are free) are also used by both professionals and casual users for graphic design, these include [[Inkscape]] (for vector graphics), [[GIMP]] (for photo-editing and image manipulation), [[Krita]] (for painting), [[Corel Graphic Suite]] (for design) and [[Scribus]] (for page layout).\n\n==Related design fields==\n===Interface design===\n{{Main article|User interface design}}\nSince the advent of personal computers, many graphic designers have become involved in [[interface design]], in an environment commonly referred to as a [[Graphical user interface|Graphical User Interface]] (GUI). This has included [[web design]] and [[software design]], when [[end user]] [[interactivity]] is a design consideration of the layout or interface. Combining visual communication skills with an understanding of user interaction and online branding, graphic designers often work with [[software developer]]s and [[web developer]]s to create the [[look and feel]] of a web site or [[software application]]. An important aspect of interface design is [[icon design]].\n\n===User experience design===\n{{Main article|User experience design}}\nUser experience design is the study, analysis, and development of a person's interaction with a company or its products.\n\n===Experiential graphic design===\n{{Main article|Environmental Graphic Design}}\n\nExperiential graphic design is the application of communication skills to the built environment. This area of graphic design requires practitioners to understand physical installations that have to be manufactured and withstand the same environmental conditions as buildings. As such, it is a cross-disciplinary collaborative process involving designers, fabricators, city planners, architects, manufacturers and construction teams.\n\nExperiential graphic designers try to solve problems that people encounter while interacting with buildings and space. Examples of practice areas for environmental graphic designers are [[wayfinding]], [[placemaking]], branded environments, exhibitions and museum displays, public installations and digital environments.\n\n==Occupations==\n{{Main article|Graphic design occupations}}\n\nGraphic design career paths cover all parts of the [[creative industries|creative spectrum]] and often overlap. Workers perform specialized tasks, such as design services, publishing, advertising and public relations. As of 2017, median pay was $48,700 per year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/arts-and-design/graphic-designers.htm|title=Graphic Designers: Occupational Outlook Handbook: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|website=www.bls.gov|url-status=live|access-date=2018-06-29}}</ref> The main job titles within the industry are often country specific. They can include [[graphic designer]], art director, [[creative director]], [[animator]] and entry level [[production artist]]. Depending on the industry served, the responsibilities may have different titles such as \"[[DTP associate|DTP Associate]]\" or \"[[Graphic Artist]]\". The responsibilities may involve specialized skills such as [[illustration]], [[photography]], [[animation]] or [[interactive design]].\n\nEmployment in design of online projects was expected to increase by 35% by 2026, while employment in traditional media, such as newspaper and book design, expect to go down by 22%. Graphic designers will be expected to constantly learn new techniques, programs, and methods.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/arts-and-design/graphic-designers.htm#tab-6|title=Graphic Designers :     Occupational Outlook Handbook: :     U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|website=www.bls.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-10-27|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171027215647/https://www.bls.gov/ooh/arts-and-design/graphic-designers.htm#tab-6|archivedate=2017-10-27}}</ref>\n\nGraphic designers can work within companies devoted specifically to the industry, such as design consultancies or branding agencies, others may work within publishing, marketing or other communications companies. Especially since the introduction of personal computers, many graphic designers work as in-house designers in non-design oriented organizations.  Graphic designers may also work [[Freelancer|freelance]], working on their own terms, prices, ideas, etc.\n\nA graphic designer typically reports to the [[art director]], [[creative director]] or [[senior media creative]]. As a designer becomes more senior, they spend less time designing and more time leading and directing other designers on broader creative activities, such as [[brand]] development and [[corporate identity]] development. They are often expected to interact more directly with clients, for example taking and interpreting briefs.\n\n===Crowdsourcing in graphic design===\n{{Main article|Crowdsourcing creative work}}\nJeff Howe of ''[[Wired Magazine]]'' first used the term \"[[crowdsourcing]]\" in his 2006 article, \"The Rise of Crowdsourcing.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Howe|first=Jeff|title=The Rise of Crowdsourcing|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.06/crowds.html?pg=4&topic=crowds&topic_set=|publisher=WIRED Magazine|accessdate=24 October 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209044356/http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.06/crowds.html?pg=4&topic=crowds&topic_set=|archivedate=9 February 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Gilmour|first=Julia|title=The Long History of Crowdsourcing \u2013 and Why You\u2019re Just Now Hearing About It|url=http://www.crowdsource.com/blog/2013/08/the-long-history-of-crowdsourcing-and-why-youre-just-now-hearing-about-it/|publisher=Crowdsource.com|accessdate=24 October 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140829172727/http://www.crowdsource.com/blog/2013/08/the-long-history-of-crowdsourcing-and-why-youre-just-now-hearing-about-it/|archivedate=29 August 2014}}</ref>  It spans such creative domains as graphic design, architecture, apparel design, writing, illustration etc. Tasks may be assigned to individuals or a group and may be categorized as convergent or divergent. An example of a divergent task is generating alternative designs for a poster. An example of a convergent task is selecting one poster design. Companies, Startups, Small businesses & Entrepreneurs have all benefitted a lot from design crowdsourcing since it helps them source great graphic designs at a fraction of the budget they used to spend before. Getting a logo design through crowdsourcing being one of the most common. Major companies who operate in the design crowdsourcing space are generally referred to as design contest sites.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Visual arts}}\n\n===Related areas===\n{{div col|colwidth=20em|content=\n* [[Concept art]]\n* [[Copywriting]]\n* [[Digital illustration]]\n* [[Illustration]]\n* [[Information technology]]\n* [[Instructional design]]\n* [[Landscape architecture]]\n* [[Marketing communications]]\n* [[Motion graphic design]]\n* [[New media]]\n* [[Technical illustration]]\n* [[Technical writing]]\n* [[User Experience Design]]\n* [[User Interface Design]]\n* [[Visual communication]]\n* [[Communication design]]\n* [[Visual culture]]\n}}\n\n===Related topics===\n{{div col|colwidth=20em|content=\n* [[Aesthetics]]\n* [[Color theory]]\n* [[Design principles and elements]]\n* [[European Design Award]]\n* [[First Things First 2000 manifesto|\"First Things First 2000\"]]\n* [[Infographic]]\n* [[:Category:Graphic design schools|List of graphic design institutions]]\n* [[List of graphic designers|List of notable graphic designers]]\n* [[Logotype]]\n* [[Material culture]]\n* [[Style guide]]\n* [[Value (colorimetry)|Value]]\n* [[Visualization (computer graphics)]]\n* [[International Typographic Style]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Fiell, Charlotte and Fiell, Peter (editors).

The field is considered a subset of [[visual communication]] and [[communication design]], but sometimes the term \"graphic [[design]]\" is used synonymously. Graphic designers create and combine symbols, images and text to form visual representations of ideas and messages. They use [[typography]], [[visual arts]], and [[page layout]] techniques to create [[Composition (visual arts)|visual compositions]]. Common applications of graphic design include [[corporate design]] (logos and branding), editorial design (magazines, newspapers and books), [[wayfinding|wayfinding or environmental design]], [[advertising]], [[web design]], [[communication design]], product [[Packaging and labeling|packaging]], and [[signage]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main article|History of graphic design}}\nThe term graphic design was coined by [[William Addison Dwiggins]] in 1922.<ref>Drucker, Johanna and McVarish, Emily, 'Graphic Design History: A critical Guide'. [[Pearson Education]], 2009</ref> However, the origins of graphic design can be traced from the origins of human existence, from the caves of [[Lascaux]], to Rome's [[Trajan's Column]] to the [[illuminated manuscript]]s of the Middle Ages, to the neon lights of [[Ginza]], [[Tokyo]]. In \"Babylon, artisans pressed cuneiform inscriptions into clay bricks or tablets which were used for construction. The bricks gave information such as the name of the reigning monarch, the builder, or some other dignitary\".<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title = Advertising In America|last = Ulanoff|first = Stanley M.|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = }}</ref> This was the first known road sign announcing the name of the governor of a state or mayor of the city. The Egyptians developed communication by hieroglyphics that used picture symbols dating as far back as 136 B.C. found on the [[Rosetta Stone]]. \"The Rosetta stone, found by one of Napoleon's engineers was an advertisement for the Egyptian ruler, Ptolemy as the \"true Son of the Sun, the Father of the Moon, and the Keeper of the Happiness of Men\"\" <ref name=\":0\"/> The Egyptians also invented [[papyrus]], paper made from reeds found along the [[Nile]], on which they transcribed advertisements more common among their people at the time. During the \"[[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]\", from 500 <small>AD</small> to 1450 <small>AD</small>, monks created elaborate, illustrated manuscripts.\n\nIn both its lengthy history and in the relatively recent explosion of [[visual communication]] in the 20th and 21st centuries, the distinction between [[advertising]], art, graphic design and [[fine art]] has disappeared. They share many elements, theories, principles, practices, [[language]]s and sometimes the same benefactor or client. In advertising, the ultimate objective is the sale of goods and services. In graphic design, \"the essence is to give order to information, form to ideas, expression, and feeling to artifacts that document human experience.\"<ref>Meggs, Philip B., 'A history of graphic design'. New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1983</ref>\n\nGraphic design in the United States began with [[Benjamin Franklin]] who used his newspaper ''[[Pennsylvania Gazette|The Pennsylvania Gazette]]'', to master the art of publicity to promote his own books and to influence the masses. \"Benjamin Franklin's ingenuity gained in strength as did his cunning and in 1737 he had replaced his counterpart in Pennsylvania, [[Andrew Bradford]] as postmaster and printer after a competition he instituted and won. He showed his prowess by running an ad in his ''General Magazine and the Historical Chronicle of British Plantations in America'' (the precursor to the [[The Saturday Evening Post|Saturday Evening Post]]) that stressed the benefits offered by a stove he invented, named the ''Pennsylvania Fireplace''. His invention is still sold today and is known as ''the [[Franklin stove]]''. \"<ref name=\":1\">Advertising Age. How It Was In Advertising: 1776-1976. Chicago, Illinois: Crain Books, 1976.</ref>\n\nAmerican advertising initially imitated British newspapers and magazines. Advertisements were printed in scrambled type and uneven lines that made it difficult to read. Franklin better organized this by adding 14-point type for the first line of the advertisement; although later shortened and centered it, making \"headlines\". Franklin added illustrations, something that London printers had not attempted. Franklin was the first to utilize [[logo]]s, which were early symbols that announced such services as opticians by displaying golden spectacles. Franklin taught advertisers that the use of detail was important in marketing their products. Some advertisements ran for 10-20 lines, including color, names, varieties, and sizes of the goods that were offered.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n===The advent of printing===\n{{Main article|History of printing}}\nDuring the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618\u2013907) wood blocks were cut to print on textiles and later to reproduce Buddhist texts. A Buddhist scripture printed in 868 is the earliest known printed book. Beginning in the 11th century, longer scrolls and books were produced using [[movable type]] printing, making books widely available during the [[Song dynasty]] (960\u20131279).<ref>\" Printing\" The Silk Road Foundation. Retrieved May 31, 2008. [http://www.silk-road.com/artl/printing.shtml Silk-road.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509141910/http://www.silk-road.com/artl/printing.shtml |date=2008-05-09 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the 17th-18th century movable type was used for handbills or trade cards which were printed from wood or copper engravings. These documents announced a business and its location. English painter [[William Hogarth]] used his skill in engraving was one of the first to design for business trade.\n\nIn Mainz Germany, in 1448, [[Johann Gutenberg]] <nowiki/>introduced movable type using a new metal alloy for use in a [[printing press]] and opened a new era of commerce. This made graphics more readily available since mass printing dropped the price of printing material significantly. Previously, most advertising was word of mouth. In France and England, for example, [[Town crier|criers]] announced products for sale just as [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]] had done.\n\nThe printing press made books more widely available. [[Aldus Manutius]] developed the book structure that became the foundation of western publication design. This era of graphic design is called [[Renaissance Humanism|Humanist]] or Old Style. Additionally, [[William Caxton]], England's first printer produced religious books, but had trouble selling them. He discovered the use of leftover pages and used them to announce the books and post them on church doors. This practice was termed ''\"squis\"'' or ''\"pin up\" posters,'' in approximately 1612, becoming the first form of print advertising in Europe''.'' The term ''Siquis'' came from the [[Roman era]] when public notices were posted stating ''\"if anybody...\"'', which in Latin is ''\"si quis\"''. These printed announcements were followed by later public registers of ''wants'' called ''want ads'' and in some areas such as the first periodical in Paris advertising was termed \"advices\". The \"Advices\" were what we know today as ''want ad media'' or ''advice columns''.\n\nIn 1638 [[Harvard University]] received a printing press from England. More than 52 years passed before London bookseller [[Benjamin Harris (publisher)|Benjamin Harris]] received another printing press in Boston. Harris published a newspaper in serial form, ''[[Publick Occurrences Both Forreign and Domestick|Publick Occurrences Both Foreign and Domestick]]''. It was four pages long and suppressed by the government after its first edition.\n\nJohn Campbell is credited for the first newspaper, the ''[[The Boston News-Letter|Boston News-Letter]]'', which appeared in 1704. The paper was known during the revolution as ''\"Weeklies\"''. The name came from the 13 hours required for the ink to dry on each side of the paper. The solution was to first, print the ads and then to print the news on the other side the day before publication. The paper was four pages long having ads on at least 20%-30% of the total paper, (pages one and four) the hot news was located on the inside.<ref name=\":1\" /> The initial use of the ''Boston News-Letter'' carried Campbell's own solicitations for advertising from his readers. Campbell's first paid advertisement was in his third edition, May 7 or 8th,  1704. Two of the first ads were for stolen anvils. The third was for real estate in [[Oyster Bay (town), New York|Oyster Bay]], owned by [[William Bradford (Colonial printer)|William Bradford]], a pioneer printer in New York, and the first to sell something of value. Bradford published his first newspaper in 1725, New York's first, the ''[[New-York Gazette]]''. Bradford's son preceded him in Philadelphia publishing the ''[[Andrew Bradford|American Weekly Mercury]]'', 1719. ''The Mercury'' and William Brooker's ''Massachusetts Gazette'', first published a day earlier.\n\n===Design industry===\nIn late 19th-century Europe, especially in the United Kingdom, the first official publication of a printed design was released, marking the separation of graphic design from fine art.\n\nIn 1849, [[Henry Cole]] became one of the major forces in [[design education]] in Great Britain, informing the government of the importance of design in his ''Journal of Design and Manufactures''. He organized the [[Great Exhibition]] as a celebration of modern industrial technology and Victorian design.\n\nFrom 1891 to 1896, [[William Morris]]' Kelmscott Press published some of the most significant of the graphic design products of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], and made a lucrative business of creating and selling stylish books. Morris created a market for works of graphic design in their own right and a profession for this new type of art. The Kelmscott Press is characterized by an obsession with historical styles. This historicism was the first significant reaction to the state of nineteenth-century graphic design.

The spread of the German [[Bauhaus]] school of design to Chicago in 1937 brought a \"mass-produced\" minimalism to America; sparking \"modern\" [[architecture]] and design. Notable names in mid-century modern design include [[Adrian Frutiger]], designer of the [[typeface]]s [[Univers]] and [[Frutiger (typeface)|Frutiger]]; [[Paul Rand]], who took the principles of the Bauhaus and applied them to popular advertising and logo design, helping to create a uniquely American approach to European minimalism while becoming one of the principal pioneers of the subset of graphic design known as [[corporate identity]]; [[Alex Steinweiss]], credited with the invention of the album cover; and [[Josef M\u00fcller-Brockmann]], who designed posters in a severe yet accessible manner typical of the 1950s and 1970s era.\n\nThe professional graphic design industry grew in parallel with [[consumerism]]. This raised concerns and criticisms, notably from within the graphic design community with the [[First Things First 1964 manifesto|First Things First manifesto]]. First launched by [[Ken Garland]] in 1964, it was re-published as the [[First Things First 2000 manifesto]] in 1999 in the magazine ''[[Emigre (magazine)|Emigre]]'' 51<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emigre.com/Editorial.php?sect=1&id=14 |title=\u0e3fEmigre Essays |publisher=Emigre.com |accessdate=2012-01-01 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106152041/http://emigre.com/Editorial.php?sect=1&id=14 |archivedate=2012-01-06 }}</ref> stating \"We propose a reversal of priorities in favor of more useful, lasting and democratic forms of communication - a mindshift away from product marketing and toward the exploration and production of a new kind of meaning.

The 2000 manifesto was also published in [[Adbusters]], known for its strong critiques of visual culture.\n\n==Applications==\n[[File:Secretary.jpg|thumb|[[Colour]]]]\nGraphic design is applied to everything visual, from [[Traffic sign|road signs]] to technical schematics, from interoffice [[memorandum]]s to reference [[User guide|manuals]].\n\nDesign can aid in selling a [[Product (business)|product]] or [[idea]]. It is applied to products and elements of company identity such as [[logo]]s, colors, [[packaging]] and text as part of [[brand]]ing (see also [[advertising]]). Branding has become increasingly more important in the range of services offered by graphic designers. Graphic designers often form part of a branding team.\n\nGraphic design is applied in the [[entertainment]] industry in decoration, scenery and visual story telling. Other examples of design for entertainment purposes include novels, vinyl [[album cover]]s, comic books, DVD covers, [[opening credits]] and [[closing credits]] in [[filmmaking]], and programs and props on stage. This could also include artwork used for T-shirts and other items screenprinted for sale.\n\nFrom scientific journals to news reporting, the presentation of opinion and facts is often improved with graphics and thoughtful compositions of visual information - known as [[information design]]. Newspapers, magazines, blogs, television and film documentaries may use graphic design. With the advent of the web, information designers with experience in interactive tools are increasingly used to illustrate the background to news stories. Information design can include [[data visualization]], which involves using programs to interpret and form data into a visually compelling presentation, and can be tied in with [[information graphics]].\n\n==Skills==\nA graphic design project may involve the stylization and presentation of existing [[writing|text]] and either preexisting [[image]]ry or images developed by the graphic designer. Elements can be incorporated in both traditional and digital form, which involves the use of visual arts, typography, and page layout techniques. Graphic designers organize pages and optionally add graphic elements. Graphic designers can commission photographers or illustrators to create original pieces. Designers use digital tools, often referred to as [[interactive design]], or [[multimedia]] design. Designers need communication skills to convince an audience and sell their designs.\n\nThe \"process school\" is concerned with communication; it highlights the channels and media through which messages are transmitted and by which senders and receivers encode and decode these messages. The semiotic school treats a message as a construction of signs which through interaction with receivers, produces meaning; communication as an agent.\n\n===Typography===\n{{Main article|Typography}}\n\nTypography includes type design, modifying type [[glyphs]] and arranging type. Type glyphs (characters) are created and modified using illustration techniques. Type arrangement is the selection of typefaces, point size, tracking (the space between all characters used), kerning (the space between two specific characters) and leading (line spacing).\n\nTypography is performed by typesetters, compositors, typographers, graphic artists, art directors, and clerical workers. Until the digital age, typography was a specialized occupation. Certain fonts communicate or resemble stereotypical notions. For example, 1942 Report is a font which types text akin to a typewriter or a vintage report.<ref>Butterick, Matthew. \"Butterick's Practical Typography.\" Butterick's Practical Typography. Jones McClure, 2010-14. Web. 17 Feb. 2015.</ref>\n\n===Page layout===\n{{Main article|Page layout}}\n[[File:Golden section in book design.svg|thumb|Golden section in book design]]\nPage layout deals with the arrangement of elements (content) on a page, such as image placement, text layout and style. Page design has always been a consideration in printed material and more recently extended to displays such as web pages. Elements typically consist of [[typography|type]] (text), [[image]]s (pictures), and (with print media) occasionally place-holder graphics such as a [[dieline]] for elements that are not printed with ink such as [[Die (manufacturing)|die]]/[[laser cutting]], [[foil stamping]] or [[Embossing (paper)|blind embossing]].\n\n===Printmaking===\n{{Main article|Printmaking}}\n\nPrintmaking is the process of making artworks by printing on [[paper]] and other materials or surfaces. The process is capable of producing multiples of the same work, each called a print. Each print is an original, technically known as an impression. Prints are created from a single original surface, technically a matrix. Common types of matrices include: plates of metal, usually copper or zinc for engraving or etching; stone, used for lithography; blocks of wood for woodcuts, linoleum for linocuts and fabric plates for screen-printing. Works printed from a single plate create an edition, in modern times usually each signed and numbered to form a limited edition. Prints may be published in book form, as artist's books. A single print could be the product of one or multiple techniques.[[Image:Pencils hb.jpg|thumb|The [[pencil]] is one of the most basic graphic design tools.]]\n\nAside from technology, graphic design requires [[judgment]] and [[creativity]]. Critical, observational, quantitative and analytic thinking are required for design layouts and [[artistic rendering|rendering]]. If the executor is merely following a solution (e.g. sketch, script or instructions) provided by another designer (such as an [[art director]]), then the executor is not usually considered the designer.\n\n=== Strategy ===\n[[Strategy]] is becoming more and more essential to effective graphic design. The main distinction between graphic design and [[art]] is that graphic design solves a problem as well as being aesthetically pleasing. This balance is where strategy comes in. It is important for a graphic designer to understand their clients' needs, as well as the needs of the people who will be interacting with the design. It is the designer's job to combine business and creative objectives to elevate the design beyond purely [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] means.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.howdesign.com/how-magazine/how-march-2013/understanding-design-strategy/|title=Understanding Design Strategy: Effective Graphic Design for Clients|last=Stone|first=Terry Lee|date=2013-02-22|website=HOW Design|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-22}}</ref>\n\n== Tools ==\nThe method of presentation (e.g. Arrangements, style, medium) is important to the design. The development and presentation tools can change how an audience perceives a project. The image or layout is produced using [[media (arts)|traditional media]] and [[technical drawing tools|guides]], or [[digital image editing]] tools on computers. Tools in [[computer graphics]] often take on traditional names such as \"scissors\" or \"[[pen]]\". Some graphic design tools such as a [[Grid (graphic design)|grid]] are used in both traditional and digital form.\n\nIn the mid-1980s [[desktop publishing]] and [[graphic art software]] applications introduced computer image manipulation and creation capabilities that had previously been manually executed. Computers enabled designers to instantly see the effects of layout or typographic changes, and to simulate the effects of traditional media. Traditional tools such as [[pencil]]s can be useful even when computers are used for finalization; a designer or art director may sketch numerous concepts as part of the [[creative process]].<ref>Jacci Howard Bear, [http://desktoppub.about.com/cs/basic/a/thumbnails.htm?terms=squiggle desktoppub.about.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206171848/http://desktoppub.about.com/cs/basic/a/thumbnails.htm?terms=squiggle |date=2013-12-06 }} Retrieved 2008-03-19</ref> Styluses can be used with tablet computers to capture hand drawings digitally.<ref>[http://vimeo.com/6986303 Milton Glaser Draws & Lectures] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140321100020/http://vimeo.com/6986303 |date=2014-03-21 }}. retrieved 31-01-2011</ref>\n\n===Computers and software===\nDesigners disagree whether computers enhance the creative process.<ref>[http://www.designtalkboard.com/designtalk/index.php/topic,1030.0.html Designtalkboard.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629214914/http://www.designtalkboard.com/designtalk/index.php/topic,1030.0.html |date=2007-06-29 }}, topic 1030 and [http://www.designtalkboard.com/designtalk/index.php/topic,1441.msg6356.html#msg6356 Designtalkboard.com], topic 1141. retrieved 3-18-2007</ref> Some designers argue that computers allow them to explore multiple ideas quickly and in more detail than can be achieved by hand-rendering or [[paste up|paste-up]].<ref>Jann Lawrence Pollard and Jerry James Little, ''Creative Computer Tools for Artists: Using Software to Develop Drawings and Paintings,'' November 2001 Introduction</ref> While other designers find the limitless choices from digital design can lead to paralysis or endless iterations with no clear outcome.\n\nMost designers use a hybrid process that combines traditional and computer-based technologies. First, hand-rendered [[Comprehensive layout|layouts]] are used to get approval to execute an idea, then the polished visual product is produced on a computer.\n\nGraphic designers are expected to be proficient in software programs for image-making, typography and layout. Nearly all of the popular and \"industry standard\" software programs used by graphic designers since the early 1990s are products of [[Adobe Systems]] Incorporated. [[Adobe Photoshop]] (a [[Raster scan|raster]]-based program for photo editing) and [[Adobe Illustrator]] (a vector-based program for drawing) are often used in the final stage. Designers often use pre-designed [[Raster graphics|raster images]] and [[vector graphics]] in their work from online design databases. Raster images may be edited in Adobe Photoshop, logos and illustrations in Adobe Illustrator, and the final product assembled in one of the major page layout programs, such as [[Adobe InDesign]], [[PagePlus|Serif PagePlus]] and [[QuarkXPress|QuarkXpress]]. Powerful open-source programs (which are free) are also used by both professionals and casual users for graphic design, these include [[Inkscape]] (for vector graphics), [[GIMP]] (for photo-editing and image manipulation), [[Krita]] (for painting), [[Corel Graphic Suite]] (for design) and [[Scribus]] (for page layout).\n\n==Related design fields==\n===Interface design===\n{{Main article|User interface design}}\nSince the advent of personal computers, many graphic designers have become involved in [[interface design]], in an environment commonly referred to as a [[Graphical user interface|Graphical User Interface]] (GUI). This has included [[web design]] and [[software design]], when [[end user]] [[interactivity]] is a design consideration of the layout or interface. Combining visual communication skills with an understanding of user interaction and online branding, graphic designers often work with [[software developer]]s and [[web developer]]s to create the [[look and feel]] of a web site or [[software application]]. An important aspect of interface design is [[icon design]].\n\n===User experience design===\n{{Main article|User experience design}}\nUser experience design is the study, analysis, and development of a person's interaction with a company or its products.\n\n===Experiential graphic design===\n{{Main article|Environmental Graphic Design}}\n\nExperiential graphic design is the application of communication skills to the built environment. This area of graphic design requires practitioners to understand physical installations that have to be manufactured and withstand the same environmental conditions as buildings. As such, it is a cross-disciplinary collaborative process involving designers, fabricators, city planners, architects, manufacturers and construction teams.\n\nExperiential graphic designers try to solve problems that people encounter while interacting with buildings and space. Examples of practice areas for environmental graphic designers are [[wayfinding]], [[placemaking]], branded environments, exhibitions and museum displays, public installations and digital environments.\n\n==Occupations==\n{{Main article|Graphic design occupations}}\n\nGraphic design career paths cover all parts of the [[creative industries|creative spectrum]] and often overlap. Workers perform specialized tasks, such as design services, publishing, advertising and public relations. As of 2017, median pay was $48,700 per year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/arts-and-design/graphic-designers.htm|title=Graphic Designers: Occupational Outlook Handbook: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|website=www.bls.gov|url-status=live|access-date=2018-06-29}}</ref> The main job titles within the industry are often country specific. They can include [[graphic designer]], art director, [[creative director]], [[animator]] and entry level [[production artist]]. Depending on the industry served, the responsibilities may have different titles such as \"[[DTP associate|DTP Associate]]\" or \"[[Graphic Artist]]\". The responsibilities may involve specialized skills such as [[illustration]], [[photography]], [[animation]] or [[interactive design]].\n\nEmployment in design of online projects was expected to increase by 35% by 2026, while employment in traditional media, such as newspaper and book design, expect to go down by 22%. Graphic designers will be expected to constantly learn new techniques, programs, and methods.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/arts-and-design/graphic-designers.htm#tab-6|title=Graphic Designers :     Occupational Outlook Handbook: :     U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|website=www.bls.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-10-27|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171027215647/https://www.bls.gov/ooh/arts-and-design/graphic-designers.htm#tab-6|archivedate=2017-10-27}}</ref>\n\nGraphic designers can work within companies devoted specifically to the industry, such as design consultancies or branding agencies, others may work within publishing, marketing or other communications companies. Especially since the introduction of personal computers, many graphic designers work as in-house designers in non-design oriented organizations.  Graphic designers may also work [[Freelancer|freelance]], working on their own terms, prices, ideas, etc.\n\nA graphic designer typically reports to the [[art director]], [[creative director]] or [[senior media creative]]. As a designer becomes more senior, they spend less time designing and more time leading and directing other designers on broader creative activities, such as [[brand]] development and [[corporate identity]] development. They are often expected to interact more directly with clients, for example taking and interpreting briefs.\n\n===Crowdsourcing in graphic design===\n{{Main article|Crowdsourcing creative work}}\nJeff Howe of ''[[Wired Magazine]]'' first used the term \"[[crowdsourcing]]\" in his 2006 article, \"The Rise of Crowdsourcing.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Howe|first=Jeff|title=The Rise of Crowdsourcing|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.06/crowds.html?pg=4&topic=crowds&topic_set=|publisher=WIRED Magazine|accessdate=24 October 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209044356/http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.06/crowds.html?pg=4&topic=crowds&topic_set=|archivedate=9 February 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Gilmour|first=Julia|title=The Long History of Crowdsourcing \u2013 and Why You\u2019re Just Now Hearing About It|url=http://www.crowdsource.com/blog/2013/08/the-long-history-of-crowdsourcing-and-why-youre-just-now-hearing-about-it/|publisher=Crowdsource.com|accessdate=24 October 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140829172727/http://www.crowdsource.com/blog/2013/08/the-long-history-of-crowdsourcing-and-why-youre-just-now-hearing-about-it/|archivedate=29 August 2014}}</ref>  It spans such creative domains as graphic design, architecture, apparel design, writing, illustration etc. Tasks may be assigned to individuals or a group and may be categorized as convergent or divergent. An example of a divergent task is generating alternative designs for a poster. An example of a convergent task is selecting one poster design. Companies, Startups, Small businesses & Entrepreneurs have all benefitted a lot from design crowdsourcing since it helps them source great graphic designs at a fraction of the budget they used to spend before. Getting a logo design through crowdsourcing being one of the most common. Major companies who operate in the design crowdsourcing space are generally referred to as design contest sites.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Visual arts}}\n\n===Related areas===\n{{div col|colwidth=20em|content=\n* [[Concept art]]\n* [[Copywriting]]\n* [[Digital illustration]]\n* [[Illustration]]\n* [[Information technology]]\n* [[Instructional design]]\n* [[Landscape architecture]]\n* [[Marketing communications]]\n* [[Motion graphic design]]\n* [[New media]]\n* [[Technical illustration]]\n* [[Technical writing]]\n* [[User Experience Design]]\n* [[User Interface Design]]\n* [[Visual communication]]\n* [[Communication design]]\n* [[Visual culture]]\n}}\n\n===Related topics===\n{{div col|colwidth=20em|content=\n* [[Aesthetics]]\n* [[Color theory]]\n* [[Design principles and elements]]\n* [[European Design Award]]\n* [[First Things First 2000 manifesto|\"First Things First 2000\"]]\n* [[Infographic]]\n* [[:Category:Graphic design schools|List of graphic design institutions]]\n* [[List of graphic designers|List of notable graphic designers]]\n* [[Logotype]]\n* [[Material culture]]\n* [[Style guide]]\n* [[Value (colorimetry)|Value]]\n* [[Visualization (computer graphics)]]\n* [[International Typographic Style]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Fiell, Charlotte and Fiell, Peter (editors).

The study of old packages is an important aspect of [[archaeology]].\n\nThe earliest recorded use of paper for packaging dates back to 1035, when a [[Persian people|Persian]] traveler visiting markets in [[Cairo]], [[History of Arab Egypt|Arab Egypt]], noted that vegetables, spices and hardware were wrapped in paper for the customers after they were sold.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=The Origins of Paper Based Packaging|author=Diana Twede|journal=Conference on Historical Analysis & Research in Marketing Proceedings|volume=12|year=2005|pages=288\u2013300 [289]|url=http://faculty.quinnipiac.edu/charm/CHARM%20proceedings/CHARM%20article%20archive%20pdf%20format/Volume%2012%202005/288%20twede.pdf|accessdate=March 20, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716105826/http://faculty.quinnipiac.edu/charm/CHARM%20proceedings/CHARM%20article%20archive%20pdf%20format/Volume%2012%202005/288%20twede.pdf|archivedate=July 16, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Modern era===\n\n====Tinning====\nThe use of [[tinning|tinplate]] for packaging dates back to the 18th century.

He sold his patent in 1812 to two other Englishmen, [[Bryan Donkin]] and John Hall, who refined the process and product and set up the world's first commercial canning factory on Southwark Park Road, London. By 1813, they were producing the first canned goods for the [[Royal Navy]].<ref>{{cite book|page=107|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eAA5M2eIWqwC|title=People and Industries|author=William H.

The first [[corrugated box]] was produced commercially in 1817 in England. [[Corrugated paper|Corrugated (also called pleated) paper]] received a British patent in 1856 and was used as a liner for tall hats. Scottish-born [[Robert Gair]] invented the pre-cut [[paperboard]] box in 1890\u2014flat pieces manufactured in bulk that folded into boxes. Gair's invention came about as a result of an accident: as a [[Brooklyn]] printer and paper-bag maker during the 1870s, he was once printing an order of seed bags, and the metal ruler, normally used to crease bags, shifted in position and cut them. Gair discovered that by cutting and creasing in one operation he could make prefabricated paperboard boxes.<ref>{{cite book|title=Cartons, crates and corrugated board: handbook of paper and wood packaging technology|author1=Diana Twede  |author2=Susan E.M.

Post-consumer recycling of aluminum and paper-based products has been economical for many years:  since the 1980s, post-consumer recycling has increased due to [[curbside recycling]], consumer awareness, and regulatory pressure.\n\n[[File:First polythene pillbox.JPG|thumb|right|170x170px|A pill box made from [[polyethylene]] in 1936.]]\nMany prominent innovations in the packaging industry were developed first for military use.  Some military supplies are packaged in the same commercial packaging used for general industry. Other military packaging must transport [[materiel]], supplies, foods, etc. under severe distribution and storage conditions. Packaging problems encountered in [[World War II]] led to [[United States Military Standard|Military Standard]] or \"mil spec\" regulations being applied to packaging, which was then designated \"military specification packaging\". As a prominent concept in the military, mil spec packaging officially came into being around 1941, due to [[Iceland in World War II|operations in Iceland]] experiencing critical losses, ultimately attributed to bad packaging. In most cases, mil spec packaging solutions (such as barrier materials, [[field ration]]s, [[antistatic bag]]s, and various [[shipping crate]]s) are similar to commercial grade packaging materials, but subject to more stringent performance and quality requirements.<ref>{{cite web|last=Maloney|first=J.C.|title=The History and Significance of Military Packaging|work=Defence Packaging Policy Group|publisher=Defence Logistics Agency|date=July 2003|url=http://www.dla.mil/Portals/104/Documents/LandAndMaritime/V/VS/Packaging/LM_pkghistory_151007.pdf}}</ref>\n\n{{As of|2003}}, the packaging sector accounted for about two percent of the [[gross national product]] in [[developed countries]].

[[Permeation]] is a critical factor in design. Some packages contain [[desiccant]]s or [[oxygen absorber]]s to help extend shelf life. [[Modified atmosphere]]s<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lee |first= Ki-Eun |author2=Kim |author3=An |author4=Lyu |author5=Lee |year=1998 |title=Effectiveness of modified atmosphere packaging in preserving a prepared ready-to-eat food|journal=Packaging Technology and Science|volume=21 |issue=7 |page= 417|doi=10.1002/pts.821 }}</ref> or controlled atmospheres are also maintained in some food packages.

A barrier is also implemented in cases where segregation of two materials prior to end use is required, as in the case of special paints, glues, medical fluids, etc.\n* '''Containment or agglomeration''' \u2013 Small objects are typically grouped together in one package for reasons of storage and selling efficiency. For example, a single box of 1000 marbles requires less physical handling than 1000 single marbles. [[Liquid]]s, [[Powder (substance)|powders]], and [[granular material]]s need containment.\n* '''Information transmission''' \u2013 Packages and [[label]]s communicate how to use, transport, [[recycling|recycle]], or dispose of the package or product. With [[Medication|pharmaceutical]]s, [[food]], [[medicine|medical]], and [[chemical substance|chemical]] products, some types of information are [[Mandatory labelling|required]] by government legislation. Some packages and labels also are used for [[track and trace]] purposes. Most items include their [[Serial number|serial]] and [[lot number]]s on the packaging, and in the case of food products, medicine, and some chemicals the packaging often contains an [[Shelf life|expiry/best-before date]], usually in a shorthand form. Packages may indicate their construction material with a symbol.\n* '''Marketing''' \u2013 Packaging and [[label]]s can be used by [[marketing|marketers]] to encourage potential buyers to purchase a product. Package [[graphic design]] and physical design have been important and constantly evolving phenomena for several decades. [[Marketing communications]] and [[graphic design]] are applied to the surface of the package and often to the [[point of sale display]]. Most packaging is designed to reflect the brand's message and identity on the one hand while highlighting the respective product concept on the other hand.\n[[File:Dual number tab on a tamper evident label.jpg|thumb|Permanent, tamper evident voiding label with a dual number tab to help keep packaging secure with the additional benefit of being able to track and trace parcels and packages]]\n[[File:Shampoo packet, single-serving.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A single-serving shampoo [[Sachet (package)|packet]]]]\n* '''Security''' \u2013 Packaging can play an important role in reducing the [[security]] risks of shipment.

Packages can be engineered to help reduce the risks of [[package pilferage]] or the theft and resale of products: Some package constructions are more resistant to pilferage than other types, and some have pilfer-indicating seals. [[Counterfeit consumer goods]], unauthorized sales (diversion), material substitution and tampering can all be minimized or prevented with such anti-counterfeiting technologies. Packages may include [[authentication]] seals and use [[security printing]] to help indicate that the package and contents are not [[counterfeit]]. Packages also can include anti-theft devices such as dye-packs, [[Radio-frequency identification|RFID]] tags, or [[electronic article surveillance]]<ref>[http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/anti-shoplifting-device.htm How Anti-shoplifting Devices Work\u201d], HowStuffWorks.com</ref> tags that can be activated or detected by devices at exit points and require specialized tools to deactivate. Using packaging in this way is a means of [[retail loss prevention]].\n* '''Convenience''' \u2013 Packages can have features that add [[convenience]] in distribution, handling, stacking, display, sale, opening, reclosing, using, dispensing, reusing, recycling, and ease of [[Waste disposal|disposal]]\n* '''Portion control''' \u2013 Single serving or single [[drug delivery|dosage]] packaging has a precise amount of contents to control usage. Bulk commodities (such as salt) can be divided into packages that are a more suitable size for individual households. It also aids the control of inventory: selling sealed one-liter bottles of milk, rather than having people bring their own bottles to fill themselves.\n* '''Branding/Positioning''' \u2013 Packaging and labels are increasingly used to go beyond marketing to brand positioning, with the materials used and design chosen key to the storytelling element of brand development. Due to the increasingly fragmented media landscape in the digital age this aspect of packaging is of growing importance.\n\n==Packaging types==\n[[File:Food packages (1).jpg|right|thumb|Various types of household packaging for foods]]\nPackaging may be of several different types. For example, a ''transport package'' or ''distribution package'' can be the [[shipping container]] used to ship, store, and handle the product or inner packages.  Some identify a ''consumer package'' as one which is directed toward a consumer or household.\n\nPackaging may be described in relation to the type of product being packaged: [[medical device]] packaging, bulk [[chemical substance|chemical]] packaging, [[over-the-counter drug]] packaging, retail [[food]] packaging, military [[materiel]] packaging, [[Medication|pharmaceutical]] packaging, etc.\n\nIt is sometimes convenient to categorize packages by layer or function: ''primary'', ''secondary'', etc.\n*Primary packaging is the material that first envelops the product and holds it. This usually is the smallest unit of distribution or use and is the package which is in direct contact with the contents.\n*Secondary packaging is outside the primary packaging, and may be used to prevent pilferage or to group primary packages together.\n*Tertiary or transit packaging is used for [[logistics|bulk handling]], [[warehouse]] storage and [[transport]] shipping. The most common form is a [[pallet]]ized [[unit load]] that packs tightly into [[containerization|container]]s.\n\nThese broad categories can be somewhat arbitrary.  For example, depending on the use, a [[shrink wrap]] can be primary packaging when applied directly to the product, secondary packaging when used to combine smaller packages, or tertiary packaging when used to facilitate some types of distribution, such as to affix a number of cartons on a pallet.\n\nPackaging can also  have categories based on  the package form.  For example, ''thermoform packaging'' and ''flexible packaging'' describe broad usage areas.\n\n==Labels and symbols used on packages==\n{{main|List of food labeling regulations}}\n[[File:HK food drink Longevity brand Sweetened Milk Mar-2014 barcode a.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[bar code]] on a tin of condensed milk]]\nMany types of symbols for package labeling are nationally and internationally standardized.  For consumer packaging, symbols exist for product certifications (such as the [[FCC Declaration of Conformity|FCC]] and [[T\u00dcV]] marks), [[trademark]]s, [[proof of purchase]], etc.  Some requirements and symbols exist to communicate aspects of consumer rights and safety, for example the [[CE marking]] or the [[estimated sign]] that notes conformance to EU weights and measures accuracy regulations. Examples of environmental and recycling symbols include the [[recycling symbol]], the [[Recycling codes|recycling code]] (which could be a [[resin identification code]]), and the [[Green Dot (symbol)|\"Green Dot\"]]. Food packaging may show [[Food contact materials|food contact material]] symbols. In the [[European Union]], products of animal origin which are intended to be consumed by humans have to carry standard, oval-shaped [[EC identification and health marks]] for food safety and quality insurance reasons.\n\n[[Barcode|Bar codes]], [[Universal Product Code]]s, and [[Radio-frequency identification|RFID]] labels are common to allow automated information management in [[logistics]] and [[retailing]]. [[Country-of-origin]] labeling is often used. Some products might use [[QR code]]s or similar [[matrix barcode]]s. Packaging may have visible [[Printing registration|registration marks]] and other printing calibration and troubleshooting cues.\n\n===Consumer package contents===\nSeveral aspects of  consumer package labeling are subject to regulation.  One of the most important is to accurately state the quantity (weight, volume, count) of the package contents.  Consumers expect that the label accurately reflects the actual contents.  Manufacturers and packagers must have effective [[quality assurance]] procedures and accurate equipment; even so, there is inherent variability in all [[Process capability|processes]]. \n\nRegulations attempt to handle both sides of this.  In the USA, the [[Fair Packaging and Labeling Act]] provides requirements for many types of products.  Also, [[NIST]] has  Handbook 133, Checking the Net Contents of Packaged Goods.<ref>{{Citation\n  | title = Checking the Net Contents of Packaged Goods, Handbook 133 - 2020\n  | publisher =US National Institute of Science and Technology\n| year =2020\n  | url = https://www.nist.gov/pml/weights-and-measures/handbook-133-2020-current-version\n  | accessdate = 8 April 2020\n}}</ref>  This is  a procedural guide for compliance testing of net contents and is referenced by several other regulatory agencies.<ref> {{cite journal\n | last =Hines\n | first =A\n | title = WEIGHING YOUR OPTIONS WITH NIST HANDBOOK 133\n | journal =Food Safety Net Services News\n | date = February 18, 2019\n | url = https://www.businesscompanion.info/en/quick-guides/weights-and-measures/packaged-goods-average-quantity\n | accessdate =8 April 2020\n}}</ref>\n\nOther regions and countries have their own regulatory requirements.  For example, the UK has its Weights and Measures (Packaged Goods) Regulations<ref> {{citation\n | title = The Weights and Measures (Packaged Goods) Regulations 2006\n | publisher =UK Statutory Instruments, 2006\u00a0No. 659\n | date =2006\n | url = http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2006/659/contents/made\n | accessdate =8 April 2020\n}}</ref> as well as several [[United Kingdom food labelling regulations|other regulations]].\n\n===Shipping container labeling===\n[[File:Print n apply ucc.jpg|left|thumb|UCC Application|\"Print & Apply\" corner wrap UCC ([[GS1-128]]) label application to a pallet load]]\nTechnologies related to shipping containers are identification codes, [[bar codes]], and electronic data interchange ([[Electronic Data Interchange|EDI]]).  These three core technologies serve to enable the business functions in the process of shipping containers throughout the distribution channel.  Each has an essential function: identification codes either relate product information or serve as keys to other data, bar codes allow for the automated input of identification codes and other data, and EDI moves data between trading partners within the distribution channel.\n\nElements of these core technologies include [[Universal Product Code|UPC]] and [[GS1|EAN]] item identification codes, the SCC-14 (UPC shipping container code), the SSCC-18 (Serial Shipping Container Codes), Interleaved 2-of-5 and UCC/EAN-128 (newly designated [[GS1-128]]) bar code [[Barcode symbology|symbologies]], and ANSI ASC X12 and UN/EDIFACT EDI standards.\n\nSmall parcel carriers often have their own formats.  For example, [[United Parcel Service]] has a [[MaxiCode]] 2-D code for parcel tracking.\n\n[[Radio-frequency identification|RFID]] labels for shipping containers are also increasingly used.  A [[Wal-Mart]] division, [[Sam's Club]], has also moved in this direction and is putting pressure on its suppliers to comply.<ref>{{cite news |first=Beth |last=Bacheldor |title=Sam's Club Tells Suppliers to Tag or Pay |url=http://www.rfidjournal.com/article/articleview/3845/1/1/ |date=January 11, 2008 |accessdate=January 17, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nShipments of [[Dangerous goods|hazardous materials]] or [[dangerous goods]] have special information and symbols (labels, placards, etc.) as required by UN, country, and specific carrier requirements. On transport packages, standardized symbols are also used to communicate handling needs. Some are defined in the [[ASTM International|ASTM]] D5445 \"Standard Practice for Pictorial Markings for Handling of Goods\" and [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 780 \"Pictorial marking for handling of goods\".\n<gallery>\nFile:Dangclass3.png|Flammable liquid\nFile:Dangclass1.svg|Explosives\nImage:Thiswayup.svg|This way up\nFile:Fragile symbol.gif|Fragile material\nImage:Keepdry.svg|Keep away from [[water]]\n</gallery>{{further|List of symbols#Consumer_symbols}}\n\n==Package development considerations==\nPackage design and development are often thought of as an integral part of the [[new product development]] process.  Alternatively, development of a package (or component) can be a separate process, but must be linked closely with the product to be packaged.\nPackage design starts with the identification of all the requirements: structural design, [[marketing]], [[shelf life]], [[quality assurance]], [[logistics]], legal, regulatory, [[graphic design]], end-use, environmental, etc. The design criteria, performance (specified by [[package testing]]),  completion time targets, resources, and cost constraints need to be established and agreed upon.  Package design processes often employ [[rapid prototyping]], [[computer-aided design]], [[computer-aided manufacturing]]  and [[document automation]].\n\n[[File:Distribution differences.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Transport packaging needs to be matched to its [[logistics]] system. Packages designed for controlled shipments of uniform [[pallet]] loads may not be suited to mixed shipments with [[express mail|express]] carriers.]]\n\nAn example of how package design is affected by other factors is its relationship to [[logistics]].  When the distribution system includes individual shipments by a small parcel carrier, the sorting, handling, and mixed stacking make severe demands on the strength and protective ability of the transport package. If the logistics system consists of uniform palletized [[unit load]]s, the structural design of the package can be designed to meet those specific needs, such as vertical stacking for a longer time frame.  A package designed for one mode of shipment may not be suited to another.\n\nWith some types of products, the design process involves detailed regulatory requirements for the packaging.  For example, any package components that may contact [[food]]s are designated [[food contact materials]].<ref>{{Cite journal\n  | last = Sotomayor\n  | first = R.E.\n  | last2 = Arvidson, Kirk, Mayer, McDougal, Sheu\n  | title = Regulatory Report, Assessing the Safety of Food Contact Substances\n  | journal = Food Safety\n   | year =2007 \n  | url = https://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodIngredientsPackaging/FoodContactSubstancesFCS/ucm064166.htm#authors}}</ref>\n[[Toxicologist]]s and [[food scientist]]s need to verify that such packaging materials are allowed by applicable regulations. [[Packaging engineer]]s need to verify that the completed package will keep the product safe for its intended [[shelf life]] with normal usage.  Packaging processes, labeling, distribution, and sale need to be [[Verification and validation|validated]] to assure that they comply with regulations that have the well being of the consumer in mind.\n\nSometimes the objectives of package development seem contradictory.  For example, regulations for an [[over-the-counter drug]] might require the package to be [[tamper-evident]] and [[Child-resistant packaging|child resistant]]:<ref>{{Cite journal\n  | last = Rodgers\n  | first = G.B.\n  | title = The safety effects of child-resistant packaging for oral prescription drugs.

Packaging should be used only where needed. Proper packaging can also help prevent waste. Packaging plays an important part in preventing loss or damage to the packaged product (contents). Usually, the energy content and material usage of the product being packaged are much greater than that of the package. A vital function of the package is to protect the product for its intended use: if the product is damaged or degraded, its entire energy and material content may be lost.\n*Minimization (also \"source reduction\") \u2013 The mass and volume of packaging (per unit of contents) can be measured and used as criteria for minimizing the package in the design process. Usually \u201creduced\u201d packaging also helps minimize costs.

Emphasis is focused on recycling the largest primary components of a package: steel, aluminum, papers, plastics, etc. Small components can be chosen which are not difficult to separate and do not contaminate recycling operations. Packages can sometimes be designed to separate components to better facilitate recycling.\n*[[Energy recovery]] \u2013 [[Waste-to-energy]] and [[Refuse-derived fuel]] in approved facilities make use of the heat available from incinerating the packaging components.\n*Disposal \u2013 [[Incineration]], and placement in a sanitary [[landfill]] are undertaken for some materials.

Packages also can include anti-theft devices such as dye-packs, [[Radio-frequency identification|RFID]] tags, or [[electronic article surveillance]]<ref>[http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/anti-shoplifting-device.htm How Anti-shoplifting Devices Work\u201d], HowStuffWorks.com</ref> tags that can be activated or detected by devices at exit points and require specialized tools to deactivate. Using packaging in this way is a means of [[retail loss prevention]].\n* '''Convenience''' \u2013 Packages can have features that add [[convenience]] in distribution, handling, stacking, display, sale, opening, reclosing, using, dispensing, reusing, recycling, and ease of [[Waste disposal|disposal]]\n* '''Portion control''' \u2013 Single serving or single [[drug delivery|dosage]] packaging has a precise amount of contents to control usage. Bulk commodities (such as salt) can be divided into packages that are a more suitable size for individual households. It also aids the control of inventory: selling sealed one-liter bottles of milk, rather than having people bring their own bottles to fill themselves.\n* '''Branding/Positioning''' \u2013 Packaging and labels are increasingly used to go beyond marketing to brand positioning, with the materials used and design chosen key to the storytelling element of brand development. Due to the increasingly fragmented media landscape in the digital age this aspect of packaging is of growing importance.\n\n==Packaging types==\n[[File:Food packages (1).jpg|right|thumb|Various types of household packaging for foods]]\nPackaging may be of several different types. For example, a ''transport package'' or ''distribution package'' can be the [[shipping container]] used to ship, store, and handle the product or inner packages.  Some identify a ''consumer package'' as one which is directed toward a consumer or household.\n\nPackaging may be described in relation to the type of product being packaged: [[medical device]] packaging, bulk [[chemical substance|chemical]] packaging, [[over-the-counter drug]] packaging, retail [[food]] packaging, military [[materiel]] packaging, [[Medication|pharmaceutical]] packaging, etc.\n\nIt is sometimes convenient to categorize packages by layer or function: ''primary'', ''secondary'', etc.\n*Primary packaging is the material that first envelops the product and holds it. This usually is the smallest unit of distribution or use and is the package which is in direct contact with the contents.\n*Secondary packaging is outside the primary packaging, and may be used to prevent pilferage or to group primary packages together.\n*Tertiary or transit packaging is used for [[logistics|bulk handling]], [[warehouse]] storage and [[transport]] shipping. The most common form is a [[pallet]]ized [[unit load]] that packs tightly into [[containerization|container]]s.\n\nThese broad categories can be somewhat arbitrary.  For example, depending on the use, a [[shrink wrap]] can be primary packaging when applied directly to the product, secondary packaging when used to combine smaller packages, or tertiary packaging when used to facilitate some types of distribution, such as to affix a number of cartons on a pallet.\n\nPackaging can also  have categories based on  the package form.  For example, ''thermoform packaging'' and ''flexible packaging'' describe broad usage areas.\n\n==Labels and symbols used on packages==\n{{main|List of food labeling regulations}}\n[[File:HK food drink Longevity brand Sweetened Milk Mar-2014 barcode a.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[bar code]] on a tin of condensed milk]]\nMany types of symbols for package labeling are nationally and internationally standardized.  For consumer packaging, symbols exist for product certifications (such as the [[FCC Declaration of Conformity|FCC]] and [[T\u00dcV]] marks), [[trademark]]s, [[proof of purchase]], etc.  Some requirements and symbols exist to communicate aspects of consumer rights and safety, for example the [[CE marking]] or the [[estimated sign]] that notes conformance to EU weights and measures accuracy regulations. Examples of environmental and recycling symbols include the [[recycling symbol]], the [[Recycling codes|recycling code]] (which could be a [[resin identification code]]), and the [[Green Dot (symbol)|\"Green Dot\"]]. Food packaging may show [[Food contact materials|food contact material]] symbols. In the [[European Union]], products of animal origin which are intended to be consumed by humans have to carry standard, oval-shaped [[EC identification and health marks]] for food safety and quality insurance reasons.\n\n[[Barcode|Bar codes]], [[Universal Product Code]]s, and [[Radio-frequency identification|RFID]] labels are common to allow automated information management in [[logistics]] and [[retailing]]. [[Country-of-origin]] labeling is often used. Some products might use [[QR code]]s or similar [[matrix barcode]]s. Packaging may have visible [[Printing registration|registration marks]] and other printing calibration and troubleshooting cues.\n\n===Consumer package contents===\nSeveral aspects of  consumer package labeling are subject to regulation.  One of the most important is to accurately state the quantity (weight, volume, count) of the package contents.  Consumers expect that the label accurately reflects the actual contents.  Manufacturers and packagers must have effective [[quality assurance]] procedures and accurate equipment; even so, there is inherent variability in all [[Process capability|processes]]. \n\nRegulations attempt to handle both sides of this.  In the USA, the [[Fair Packaging and Labeling Act]] provides requirements for many types of products.  Also, [[NIST]] has  Handbook 133, Checking the Net Contents of Packaged Goods.<ref>{{Citation\n  | title = Checking the Net Contents of Packaged Goods, Handbook 133 - 2020\n  | publisher =US National Institute of Science and Technology\n| year =2020\n  | url = https://www.nist.gov/pml/weights-and-measures/handbook-133-2020-current-version\n  | accessdate = 8 April 2020\n}}</ref>  This is  a procedural guide for compliance testing of net contents and is referenced by several other regulatory agencies.<ref> {{cite journal\n | last =Hines\n | first =A\n | title = WEIGHING YOUR OPTIONS WITH NIST HANDBOOK 133\n | journal =Food Safety Net Services News\n | date = February 18, 2019\n | url = https://www.businesscompanion.info/en/quick-guides/weights-and-measures/packaged-goods-average-quantity\n | accessdate =8 April 2020\n}}</ref>\n\nOther regions and countries have their own regulatory requirements.  For example, the UK has its Weights and Measures (Packaged Goods) Regulations<ref> {{citation\n | title = The Weights and Measures (Packaged Goods) Regulations 2006\n | publisher =UK Statutory Instruments, 2006\u00a0No. 659\n | date =2006\n | url = http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2006/659/contents/made\n | accessdate =8 April 2020\n}}</ref> as well as several [[United Kingdom food labelling regulations|other regulations]].\n\n===Shipping container labeling===\n[[File:Print n apply ucc.jpg|left|thumb|UCC Application|\"Print & Apply\" corner wrap UCC ([[GS1-128]]) label application to a pallet load]]\nTechnologies related to shipping containers are identification codes, [[bar codes]], and electronic data interchange ([[Electronic Data Interchange|EDI]]).  These three core technologies serve to enable the business functions in the process of shipping containers throughout the distribution channel.  Each has an essential function: identification codes either relate product information or serve as keys to other data, bar codes allow for the automated input of identification codes and other data, and EDI moves data between trading partners within the distribution channel.\n\nElements of these core technologies include [[Universal Product Code|UPC]] and [[GS1|EAN]] item identification codes, the SCC-14 (UPC shipping container code), the SSCC-18 (Serial Shipping Container Codes), Interleaved 2-of-5 and UCC/EAN-128 (newly designated [[GS1-128]]) bar code [[Barcode symbology|symbologies]], and ANSI ASC X12 and UN/EDIFACT EDI standards.\n\nSmall parcel carriers often have their own formats.  For example, [[United Parcel Service]] has a [[MaxiCode]] 2-D code for parcel tracking.\n\n[[Radio-frequency identification|RFID]] labels for shipping containers are also increasingly used.  A [[Wal-Mart]] division, [[Sam's Club]], has also moved in this direction and is putting pressure on its suppliers to comply.<ref>{{cite news |first=Beth |last=Bacheldor |title=Sam's Club Tells Suppliers to Tag or Pay |url=http://www.rfidjournal.com/article/articleview/3845/1/1/ |date=January 11, 2008 |accessdate=January 17, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nShipments of [[Dangerous goods|hazardous materials]] or [[dangerous goods]] have special information and symbols (labels, placards, etc.) as required by UN, country, and specific carrier requirements. On transport packages, standardized symbols are also used to communicate handling needs. Some are defined in the [[ASTM International|ASTM]] D5445 \"Standard Practice for Pictorial Markings for Handling of Goods\" and [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 780 \"Pictorial marking for handling of goods\".\n<gallery>\nFile:Dangclass3.png|Flammable liquid\nFile:Dangclass1.svg|Explosives\nImage:Thiswayup.svg|This way up\nFile:Fragile symbol.gif|Fragile material\nImage:Keepdry.svg|Keep away from [[water]]\n</gallery>{{further|List of symbols#Consumer_symbols}}\n\n==Package development considerations==\nPackage design and development are often thought of as an integral part of the [[new product development]] process.  Alternatively, development of a package (or component) can be a separate process, but must be linked closely with the product to be packaged.\nPackage design starts with the identification of all the requirements: structural design, [[marketing]], [[shelf life]], [[quality assurance]], [[logistics]], legal, regulatory, [[graphic design]], end-use, environmental, etc. The design criteria, performance (specified by [[package testing]]),  completion time targets, resources, and cost constraints need to be established and agreed upon.  Package design processes often employ [[rapid prototyping]], [[computer-aided design]], [[computer-aided manufacturing]]  and [[document automation]].\n\n[[File:Distribution differences.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Transport packaging needs to be matched to its [[logistics]] system. Packages designed for controlled shipments of uniform [[pallet]] loads may not be suited to mixed shipments with [[express mail|express]] carriers.]]\n\nAn example of how package design is affected by other factors is its relationship to [[logistics]].  When the distribution system includes individual shipments by a small parcel carrier, the sorting, handling, and mixed stacking make severe demands on the strength and protective ability of the transport package. If the logistics system consists of uniform palletized [[unit load]]s, the structural design of the package can be designed to meet those specific needs, such as vertical stacking for a longer time frame.  A package designed for one mode of shipment may not be suited to another.\n\nWith some types of products, the design process involves detailed regulatory requirements for the packaging.  For example, any package components that may contact [[food]]s are designated [[food contact materials]].<ref>{{Cite journal\n  | last = Sotomayor\n  | first = R.E.\n  | last2 = Arvidson, Kirk, Mayer, McDougal, Sheu\n  | title = Regulatory Report, Assessing the Safety of Food Contact Substances\n  | journal = Food Safety\n   | year =2007 \n  | url = https://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodIngredientsPackaging/FoodContactSubstancesFCS/ucm064166.htm#authors}}</ref>\n[[Toxicologist]]s and [[food scientist]]s need to verify that such packaging materials are allowed by applicable regulations. [[Packaging engineer]]s need to verify that the completed package will keep the product safe for its intended [[shelf life]] with normal usage.  Packaging processes, labeling, distribution, and sale need to be [[Verification and validation|validated]] to assure that they comply with regulations that have the well being of the consumer in mind.\n\nSometimes the objectives of package development seem contradictory.  For example, regulations for an [[over-the-counter drug]] might require the package to be [[tamper-evident]] and [[Child-resistant packaging|child resistant]]:<ref>{{Cite journal\n  | last = Rodgers\n  | first = G.B.\n  | title = The safety effects of child-resistant packaging for oral prescription drugs.

Meeting all goals is a challenge.\n\nPackage design may take place within a company or with various degrees of external [[packaging engineering]]: [[independent contractor]]s, [[consultant]]s, vendor evaluations, independent laboratories, contract packagers, total [[outsourcing]], etc.  Some sort of formal [[project planning]] and [[project management]] methodology is required for all but the simplest package design and development programs. An effective [[quality management]] system and [[Verification and Validation]] protocols are mandatory for some types of packaging and recommended for all.\n\n===Environmental considerations===\n[[File:Waste hierarchy rect-en.svg|right|thumbnail|300px|The [[waste hierarchy]]]]\n{{main|Packaging waste|sustainable packaging}}\n\nPackage development involves considerations of [[sustainability]], environmental responsibility, and applicable [[Environmental policy|environmental]] and [[recycling]] regulations.

Packaging should be used only where needed. Proper packaging can also help prevent waste. Packaging plays an important part in preventing loss or damage to the packaged product (contents). Usually, the energy content and material usage of the product being packaged are much greater than that of the package. A vital function of the package is to protect the product for its intended use: if the product is damaged or degraded, its entire energy and material content may be lost.\n*Minimization (also \"source reduction\") \u2013 The mass and volume of packaging (per unit of contents) can be measured and used as criteria for minimizing the package in the design process. Usually \u201creduced\u201d packaging also helps minimize costs. Packaging engineers continue to work toward reduced packaging.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wcco.com/topstories/local_story_197233456.html |title=The Incredible Shrinking Package |accessdate=July 16, 2007 |last=DeRusha |first=Jason |date=July 16, 2007 |publisher=WCCO |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070717171902/http://wcco.com/topstories/local_story_197233456.html |archivedate=July 17, 2007 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n*Reuse \u2013 [[Reusable packaging]] is encouraged.<ref>{{Citation\n| title =Use Reusables: Fundamentals of Reusable Transport Packaging\n| publisher =US Environmental Protection Agency\n| year =2012\n| url =http://www.epa.gov/wastes/conserve/smm/web-academy/2012/pdfs/smm812_Lehrer.pdf\n| accessdate =June 30, 2014\n| url-status =dead\n| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20150114164418/http://www.epa.gov/wastes/conserve/smm/web-academy/2012/pdfs/smm812_Lehrer.pdf\n| archivedate =January 14, 2015\n| df =mdy-all\n}}</ref>  Returnable packaging has long been useful (and economically viable) for closed loop logistics systems.

Emphasis is focused on recycling the largest primary components of a package: steel, aluminum, papers, plastics, etc. Small components can be chosen which are not difficult to separate and do not contaminate recycling operations. Packages can sometimes be designed to separate components to better facilitate recycling.\n*[[Energy recovery]] \u2013 [[Waste-to-energy]] and [[Refuse-derived fuel]] in approved facilities make use of the heat available from incinerating the packaging components.\n*Disposal \u2013 [[Incineration]], and placement in a sanitary [[landfill]] are undertaken for some materials.  Certain US states regulate packages for toxic contents, which have the potential to contaminate emissions and ash from incineration and [[leachate]] from landfill. Packages should not be [[litter]]ed.\n\nDevelopment of [[sustainable packaging]] is an area of considerable interest to [[standards organization]]s, governments, consumers, packagers, and retailers.\n\nSustainability is the fastest-growing driver for packaging development, particularly for packaging manufacturers that work with the world's leading brands, as their CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) targets often exceed those of the EU Directive.\n\n==Packaging machinery==\n{{main|Packaging machinery}}\n[[File:Budweiser Plant.jpg|right|thumbnail|400px|Beer [[bottling line]]s]]\nChoosing packaging machinery includes an assessment of technical capabilities, labor requirements, worker safety, [[maintainability]], serviceability, [[reliability engineering|reliability]], ability to integrate into the packaging line, capital cost, floorspace, flexibility (change-over, materials, multiple products, etc.), energy requirements, [[Quality control|quality]] of outgoing packages, qualifications (for food, pharmaceuticals, etc.), throughput, efficiency, productivity, [[ergonomics]], [[return on investment]], etc.\n\nPackaging machinery can be:\n# purchased as standard, off-the-shelf equipment\n# purchased custom-made or custom-tailored to specific operations\n# manufactured or modified by in-house engineers and maintenance staff\n\nEfforts at packaging line [[automation]] increasingly use [[programmable logic controller]]s and [[robotics]].\n\nPackaging machines may be of the following general types:\n*Accumulating and collating machines\n* [[Blister pack]]s, [[skin pack]]s and vacuum packaging machines\n* [[Bottle cap]]s equipment, over-capping, lidding, closing, seaming and sealing machines\n* [[Box]], case, tray, and carrier forming, packing, unpacking, closing, and sealing machines\n* [[Cartoning machines]]\n* Cleaning, sterilizing, cooling and drying machines\n* Coding, printing, marking, stamping, and imprinting machines\n* [[Converting]] machines\n* [[Conveyor belt]]s, accumulating and related machines\n* Feeding, orienting, placing and related machines\n* [[Filler (packaging)|Filling machines]]: handling dry, powdered, solid, liquid, gas, or viscous products\n* [[Inspection|Inspecting]]: visual, sound, metal detecting, etc.\n* [[Label dispenser]]\n* Orienting, unscrambling machines\n* Package filling and closing machines\n* [[Pallet]]izing, depalletizing, [[unit load]] assembly\n* Product identification: [[label]]ing, marking, etc.\n* Sealing machines: [[heat sealer]] or glue units\n* [[Slitter|Slitting machines]]\n* Weighing machines: [[check weigher]], [[multihead weigher]]\n* Wrapping machines: stretch wrapping, [[shrink wrap]], banding\n* [[Vertical form fill sealing machine|Form, fill and seal machines]]\n* Other specialty machinery: [[slitter]]s, [[perforate|perforating]], [[laser]] cutters, parts attachment, etc.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nImage:SSF Costco bakery pastry packaging line.JPG|Bakery goods [[shrinkwrap]]ped by shrink film, [[heat sealer]] and [[heat tunnel]] on roller [[Lineshaft roller conveyor|conveyor]]\nImage:Auto Sorting Packages.jpg|High speed conveyor with stationary [[bar code scanner]] for sorting\nImage:4051 lpa.jpg|[[Label printer]] applicator applying a label to adjacent panels of a [[corrugated box]].\nImage:Factory Automation Robotics Palettizing Bread.jpg|[[Robotics|Robots]] used to palletize bread\nImage:Stretch wrapping machine.jpg|Automatic stretch wrapping machine\nFile:Molding packaging from straw, k9837-1.jpg|Equipment used for making [[molded pulp]] components and molding packaging from [[straw]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last = Wood|first = Marcia|title = Leftover Straw Gets New Life|journal = Agricultural Research|date=April 2002|url = http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/AR/archive/apr02/straw0402.htm}}</ref>\nImage:Rotary Arm Freedom 6500.jpg|A semi-automatic [[rotary arm stretch wrapper]]\nFile:Jsc2008e038873 SFSL Lab Pack Room.jpg|Equipment for thermoforming packages at NASA\nFile:Pol Roger labelling line 2.jpg|Automated labeling line for wine bottles\nFile:Shrink-wrapping_machine_by_OCME_S.r.L.jpg|Shrink film wrap being applied on PET bottles\nFile:Laboratoires Arkopharma -
