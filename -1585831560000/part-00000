Often, they will be served with pickles, chutneys, dal masalas, potato masala, or gourd curry (either ivy, ridge, or bottle varieties).\n\n== Types, variants ==\nA variant of puri is [[bhatoora]], which is three times the size of a puri and served with [[chana masala|chholey]] (spicy chick peas). It often constitutes a full meal. (See [[chole bhature]]).

It often constitutes a full meal. (See [[chole bhature]]). Bhatoora bread is with yeast and puri bread made from unleavened dough.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ramineni |first=Shubhra |title=Entice With Spice: Easy Indian Recipes for Busy People |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LpXTAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT206}}</ref>\n\nIn the Indian state of [[Odisha]] a large size puri is made during [[Bali Yatra]] which is called ''thunka puri'' ({{Lang-or|\u0b20\u0b41\u0b19\u0b4d\u0b15\u0b3e \u0b2a\u0b41\u0b30\u0b3f}}).<ref>[http://cmccuttack.gov.in/overview_on_cuttack.html Overview of Cuttack]</ref><ref>[http://www.odiaa.com/2011/11/fanfare-spectacle-mark-the-opening-of-bali-yatra/ Fanfare & spectacle mark the opening of Bali Yatra] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403141410/http://www.odiaa.com/2011/11/fanfare-spectacle-mark-the-opening-of-bali-yatra/ |date=3 April 2015}}, 10 November 2011</ref><ref>[http://orissadiary.com/CurrentNews.asp?id=22539 Orissa CM Naveen Patnaik inaugurates historic Baliyatra festival in Cuttack], 22 November 2010</ref><ref>[http://www.odishanewstoday.com/entertainment/1279-bali-yatra-fever-grips-cuttack.html Bali Yatra Fever grips Cuttack], 12 November 2011 {{deadlink|date=September 2019}}</ref><ref>''Binita Jaiswal'', [http://m.timesofindia.com/PDATOI/articleshow/10684108.cms Fanfare & spectacle mark the opening of Bali Yatra], 10 November 2011</ref>\n\nAnother variant, largely popular in the Northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh is ''bedvi''.
