The ZAMG headquarters are located in [[Vienna]], with regional offices in [[Salzburg]], [[Innsbruck]], [[Graz]] and [[Klagenfurt]].\n\nZAMG was founded in 1851 and is the oldest [[weather forecasting|weather service]] in the world. Its task is not only to operate monitoring networks and to conduct research in various fields, but also to make the results available to the public.\n\n==Organization==\n[[File:Hohe Warte bei Nacht.JPG|thumb|ZAMG headquarters by night]]\nThe [[Hohe Warte, Vienna|Hohe Warte]] in the [[D\u00f6bling]] district of Vienna is the headquarters of the Institution and is the regional office for Vienna, [[Lower Austria]] and [[Burgenland]]. Other regional ZAMG offices are:\n\n* Regional office for [[Salzburg (state)|Salzburg]] and [[Upper Austria]] (city of [[Salzburg]])\n* Regional office for [[Vorarlberg]] and [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]] ([[Innsbruck]])\n* Regional office for [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]] ([[Klagenfurt]])\n* Regional office for [[Styria]] ([[Graz]])\n\nOther ZAMG facilities and observatories are:\n\n* [[Hoher Sonnblick]] Observatory\n* [[Victor Conrad|Conrad]] Observatory, [[Muggendorf]]\n\nThe grounds of the Institution has a radar tower. This office building is now home to a large [[meteorology]] and [[geophysics]] library.\n\n==Departments==\nToday the ZAMG, as a semi-autonomous institution, is a modern service provider. ZAMG is divided into departments, including the following:\n\n* The synoptic scale metrology department is responsible for providing daily forecasting services using modern technology.\n* The geophysics department provides information on earthquakes and the geomagnetic field.\n* The climate department uses data obtained from the Austrian Monitoring Network to create climate statistics and maps. This department also conducts research into Austria's climate and how it is changing, which includes work on [[glaciology]].\n* The technical department is in charge of the meteorological monitoring network, which consists of semi-automatic weather detection systems (TAWES stations) and semi-automatic climate stations (TAKLIS stations).\n* The environmental meteorology department studies the spread of pollutants in the atmosphere. One of its tasks is to provide the government with information in the event of a crisis (e.g. radioactivity into the atmosphere).\n* The data processing department uses the latest equipment to manage the extensive computer-controlled processes.\n\n===Climate===\nOne of ZAMG's key tasks is to observe and explore the climate in Austria. A network of over two hundred semi-automatic weather stations (TAWES) throughout Austria is in place for this purpose. Meteorological parameters such as pressure, temperature, wind and precipitation are recorded from [[Lake Constance]] to [[Lake Neusiedl]], and from the plains to the mountains (Sonnblick Date Observatory). This data is the basis for climate research and is particularly important for understanding current climate change.\n\n===Synoptic scale and environmental metrology===\nThe synoptic scale metrology department deals with areas of remote sensing, using manual and automatic interpretation of satellite and radar data to make forecasts. In the field of numerical models, research focuses on the development of LAM Aladin, as in the new development of nowcasting model INCA.\n\n===Environment===\nThe environmental meteorology department deals with the spread of pollutants in the atmosphere and the meteorological processes that affect the spread of pollutants. This is one of the priorities of the department's applied research in this area.\n\n===Geophysics===\nThe first regional geomagnetic survey of the Austrio-Hungarian crown lands was conducted by [[Karl Kreil]] in 1846\u20131851. On the occasion of the earthquake in [[Ljubljana]], [[Slovenia]], in 1895, the Austrian Seismological Service was founded. Since then, research has been carried out continuously in both fields. Today's activities include geophysical and environmental issues.\n\n==History==\n[[File:(C)ZAMG hannhausk sonne.jpg|thumb|Julius-Hann-Haus, Hohe Warte, Vienna]]\nIn July 1851 [[Emperor]] [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] approved the establishment of \"a central institution for meteorological and magnetic observations\", the Central Institution for Meteorology and Earth Magnetism, which dates back to an initiative of the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences]]. This sent the request in 1848 to Karl Kreil, director of the observatory at [[Prague]], and full member of the Academy, a meteorological observation system for the Austrian monarchy designing.\n\nKarl Kreil (1798\u20131862) became the first director of the newly founded Central Institution of Wieden, and also professor of physics at the [[University of Vienna]]. This personal union between one hand and Director of University Teachers on the other, remained to this day and lasting influence on the scientific research at the Central Institution. Kreil set up a meteorological observation system for the entire territory of the Austrian monarchy and carried out for this also the first country geomagnetic recording. 1865, began at the Central Institution with the publication of a daily weather map. [[Karl Jelinek]] succeeded him.\n\n1872 moved to Central, in the new and final quarters of the Hohe Warte in Vienna Dobling which Henry Ferstel built. A year later, in 1873, the Central Institution organized the first international meteorological congress in Vienna, founded the [[International Meteorological Organization]] (IMO) as a precursor of the [[World Meteorological Organization]] (WMO).\n\nIn 1877 the output of daily telegraphic weather reports carried out, with a synoptic map and the forecast for the next day. The new report contained the morning of 60 observation stations from all over [[Europe]], including 24 domestic ones.\n\nBy decree of 23 February 1904, was transferred to the Central Institution for the entire seismic Austria, which took the name change to Central Institution for Meteorology and Geodynamics after him.\n\nIn his position as Director Kreil followed by outstanding scientists, including [[Julius Hann]] (1839\u20131921) and [[Felix Maria von Exner]] (1876\u20131930).

In 1957 a house on the neighboring property was purchased and subsequently adapted for office use; between 1967 and 1973 a radar tower, a balloon-filling house and a new office building including specialised libraries were built at the site of the Central Institution.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Meteoalarm]]\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Zentralanstalt f\u00fcr Meteorologie und Geodynamik}}\n* {{Official website}}\n\n{{National meteorological organisations}}\n\n[[Category:Governmental meteorological agencies in Europe]]\n[[Category:Government agencies established in 1851]]\n[[Category:1851 establishments in the Austrian Empire]]\n", "text_old": "{{hatnote|Not to be confused with the [[Central Institute of Metrology]] in North Korea.}}\n{{unreferenced|date=April 2016}}\n{{Infobox government agency\n|agency_name     = Central Institution for Meteorology and Geodynamics\n|nativename      = ''{{lang|de|Zentralanstalt f\u00fcr Meteorologie und Geodynamik}}''\n|nativename_a    = ZAMG\n|logo            = ZAMG logoB.svg\n|formed          = 1851\n|jurisdiction    = {{flagicon|AUT}} [[Austrian Federal Government]]\n|headquarters    = [[Hohe Warte, Vienna]]\n|employees       = \n|budget          = \n|minister1_name  = \n|minister1_pfo   = \n|chief1_name     = Dr [[Michael Staudinger]]\n|chief1_position = \n|parent_agency   = [[Federal Ministry of Science and Research (Austria)|Federal Ministry of Science and Research]]\n|child1_agency   = \n|website         = {{URL|http://www.zamg.ac.at/}}\n|footnotes       = \n}}\nThe '''Central Institution for Meteorology and Geodynamics''' ({{lang-de|Zentralanstalt f\u00fcr Meteorologie und Geodynamik}}, ZAMG) is the national [[Meteorology|meteorological]] and [[Geophysics|geophysical]] service of [[Austria]].\n\nIt is a subordinate agency of the [[Federal Ministry of Science and Research (Austria)|Austrian Federal Ministry for Science and Research]].

No risk of allergy exists but the results are very temporary because the body quickly absorbs the material.\n*'''[[Collagen]]''' requires an allergy test because the material is extracted from bovine [[Hide (skin)|hides]]. It lasts anywhere from four weeks to three months because it is also absorbed into the body. However, the allergy test must be observed for four weeks.\n*'''Dermalogen''' is taken from the patient's skin\u2014and through a [[laboratory]] process\u2014made into a high concentration collagen that can be injected into the lips. Some studies indicate it lasts somewhat longer than collagen.\n*'''Alloderm''' is donor [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] taken from [[cadavers]] and then denatured, purified and treated to remove viable [[cell (biology)|cell]]s that could pass along [[disease]]. Under a local [[anesthesia]], Alloderm is placed into the [[mucosa]], or body, of the lips in small rolls to make them larger. Alloderm can also be placed into the [[Vermilion border|vermilion]], the pink area of the lip, to provide definition and a sharper [[border]].\n*'''Radiance''', a synthetic, laboratory produced solution containing calcium hydroxylapatite (bone) suspended in a [[gel]] that has been safely used in medicine for years. Some studies indicate Radiance can last between three and five years. One researcher (Tzikas) found in a study of Radiance on 90 patients that 59 percent felt when injected, moderate to severe [[pain]] which disappeared two to five minutes later. But the substance produced results for an average of two years with a few patients reporting the plumping effects being sustained as long as three to five years. Of the 90 patients, four required [[surgery|surgical intervention]] due to [[Nodule (medicine)|nodules]] in the lips.<ref>Tzikas, T. L. Evaluation of the Radiance FN Soft Tissue Filler for Facial Soft Tissue Augmentation. Arch Facial Plast Surg. 2004; 6:234-239</ref>\n*'''[[Gore-Tex]] implants'''. In medical uses, Gore-Tex is known as EPTFE, or expanded [[polytetrafluoroethylene]] and, commercially as Advanta, UltraSoft, and SoftForm. The EPTFE is delivered to surgeons in strips that are 1/16&nbsp;inch (2.4 mm) and 3/16 (3.4&nbsp;mm) diameter [[Cylinder (geometry)|tubes]].<ref>Fezza JP.Advanta implants, Facial Plast Surgy, 2004 May;20(2):185-9</ref>\n\n==Current popular procedures==\n\nSince 2000, more products and techniques have been developed to make lip augmentation more effective and patient friendly. The relative ease of many injections is due to surgeons using tiny 30 and 31 gauge (about as thick as a dozen human hairs) [[Hypodermic needle|needles]] that are used to inject the very sensitive lips. Nonetheless, [[topical]] anesthesias are often used for lip augmentation procedures.\n\nSome of these new techniques and substances include.\n*'''[[Fat transfer]]'''. [[Surgeon]]s [[harvest]] through [[liposuction]] or [[surgery|excision]] the patient's fat from places on the body where it can be spared and either injected or surgically placed into the lips. Surgical applications usually require general anesthesia.\n*'''[[Restylane]]''', a non-animal, clear gel that is reported to be very close to the [[hyaluronic acid]] found naturally in the body. According to the [[American Society of Plastic Surgeons]], there were 778,000 cases of Restylane injection  in 2006, the most recent year for which statistics are available.<ref><!-- {{cite web |url=http://www.plasticsurgery.org/media/Press_Kits/Procedural-Statistics-Press-Kit-Index.cfm |title=2006 Procedural Statistics Press Kit |author= |date= |work=News Room |publisher=American Society of Plastic Surgeons |accessdate=31 August 2010}} --> BLACK LISTED</ref> The substance usually lasts six months and, sometimes, longer. While [[Juvederm]] is extremely chemically close to Restylane; many surgeons report the former is slightly smoother to inject.\n*'''[[Artecoll]]'''. Both Artecoll and ArteFill are not used to inject the body of the lips because the substance is heavy and would show as white through the thin skin of the lips. Additionally, both products contain tiny [[microspheres]] known as [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|PMMA]] (polymethylmethacrylate) which remain in the face permanently. In cases where Artecoll has been used around the edges of the lips to remove fine lines and wrinkles, some patients have reported annoying nodules or small lumps. In a few cases, surgery was required to remove the Artecoll.<ref>Blanchard, M. Filler material may cause nodules, lumps in lips. Cosmetic Surgery Times, 15 June, Issue, 2002</ref>\n\n==Non-surgical alternatives==\n*'''Lip plumper''' is a [[cosmetics|cosmetic]] product used to make lips appear fuller.

Lip enhancement: surgical Alternatives and Histologic Aspects. Plastic & Reconstructive Surgery. 105(3):1173-1183, March 2000</ref> When the lips are overfilled, the results can be comic, often supplying fodder to [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] newspapers and offbeat websites. This look is sometimes mockingly called a 'trout pout.' Overaggressive injections can lead to lumpiness while too little can result in [[ridges]].    \n\nCommon reactions can range from redness, swelling or [[itching]] at the injection site(s). Other possible complications include [[bleeding]], uneven lips, [[Motion (physics)|movement]] of the implants or extrusion, when an [[implant (medicine)|implant]] breaks through the outermost surface of the skin. The usual, expected [[Swelling (medical)|swelling]] and [[bruising]] can last from several days to a week.\n\nSome patients are allergic to the common local anesthetics like [[lidocaine]] and probably should not consider lip injections. Some react badly to the skin test that patients must take before receiving collagen. Other patients who should forego procedures to the lip include those who have active skin conditions like [[cold sores]], blood [[clotting]] problems, [[infections]], scarring of the lips or certain diseases like [[diabetes]] or [[Systemic lupus erythematosus|lupus]] that cause slower healing. Patients with facial [[nerve]] disorders, severe [[hypertension]] or recurrent [[herpes simplex]] [[lesions]] should also eschew lip augmentation. As in all surgeries, [[smoking|smokers]] complicate completion of their procedure as well as the speed of [[healing]].\n\nFat transfer can last longer than other injected materials but can have lumping or scarring effects. The length of time a fat transfer may last in the lips is often determined by how much the area moves and how close it is to a major blood supply.  In addition, the donor fat must be harvested from another area of the patient's body which leaves another\u2014albeit tiny\u2014surgical [[wound]]. However, donor fat harvesting techniques have become extremely well refined.<ref>Coleman, SR. Long term survival for fat transplants: controlled demonstration. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery 2996; 19:421-425</ref>\n\n==Discussion==\nCosmetic surgery providers often advise their patients that many options now exist for improving the appearance of the lips.  Most practitioners also admit that successful lip augmentation is highly dependent on the skill of the provider, with that skill stemming from many years of experience injecting the lips of many types of patients. Moreover, the surgeon must master the various injection techniques. With many injectables, the benefit to the patient is an immediate return to normal, usual activities. A few surgeons offer a procedure known as surgical flap augmentations in which small sections of skin near the lips or inside the mouth are excised and added to the lips.

No risk of allergy exists but the results are very temporary because the body quickly absorbs the material.\n*'''[[Collagen]]''' requires an allergy test because the material is extracted from bovine [[Hide (skin)|hides]]. It lasts anywhere from four weeks to three months because it is also absorbed into the body. However, the allergy test must be observed for four weeks.\n*'''Dermalogen''' is taken from the patient's skin\u2014and through a [[laboratory]] process\u2014made into a high concentration collagen that can be injected into the lips. Some studies indicate it lasts somewhat longer than collagen.\n*'''Alloderm''' is donor [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] taken from [[cadavers]] and then denatured, purified and treated to remove viable [[cell (biology)|cell]]s that could pass along [[disease]]. Under a local [[anesthesia]], Alloderm is placed into the [[mucosa]], or body, of the lips in small rolls to make them larger. Alloderm can also be placed into the [[Vermilion border|vermilion]], the pink area of the lip, to provide definition and a sharper [[border]].\n*'''Radiance''', a synthetic, laboratory produced solution containing calcium hydroxylapatite (bone) suspended in a [[gel]] that has been safely used in medicine for years. Some studies indicate Radiance can last between three and five years. One researcher (Tzikas) found in a study of Radiance on 90 patients that 59 percent felt when injected, moderate to severe [[pain]] which disappeared two to five minutes later. But the substance produced results for an average of two years with a few patients reporting the plumping effects being sustained as long as three to five years. Of the 90 patients, four required [[surgery|surgical intervention]] due to [[Nodule (medicine)|nodules]] in the lips.<ref>Tzikas, T. L. Evaluation of the Radiance FN Soft Tissue Filler for Facial Soft Tissue Augmentation. Arch Facial Plast Surg. 2004; 6:234-239</ref>\n*'''[[Gore-Tex]] implants'''. In medical uses, Gore-Tex is known as EPTFE, or expanded [[polytetrafluoroethylene]] and, commercially as Advanta, UltraSoft, and SoftForm. The EPTFE is delivered to surgeons in strips that are 1/16&nbsp;inch (2.4 mm) and 3/16 (3.4&nbsp;mm) diameter [[Cylinder (geometry)|tubes]].<ref>Fezza JP.Advanta implants, Facial Plast Surgy, 2004 May;20(2):185-9</ref>\n\n==Current popular procedures==\n\nSince 2000, more products and techniques have been developed to make lip augmentation more effective and patient friendly. The relative ease of many injections is due to surgeons using tiny 30 and 31 gauge (about as thick as a dozen human hairs) [[Hypodermic needle|needles]] that are used to inject the very sensitive lips. Nonetheless, [[topical]] anesthesias are often used for lip augmentation procedures.\n\nSome of these new techniques and substances include.\n*'''[[Fat transfer]]'''. [[Surgeon]]s [[harvest]] through [[liposuction]] or [[surgery|excision]] the patient's fat from places on the body where it can be spared and either injected or surgically placed into the lips. Surgical applications usually require general anesthesia.\n*'''[[Restylane]]''', a non-animal, clear gel that is reported to be very close to the [[hyaluronic acid]] found naturally in the body. According to the [[American Society of Plastic Surgeons]], there were 778,000 cases of Restylane injection  in 2006, the most recent year for which statistics are available.<ref><!-- {{cite web |url=http://www.plasticsurgery.org/media/Press_Kits/Procedural-Statistics-Press-Kit-Index.cfm |title=2006 Procedural Statistics Press Kit |author= |date= |work=News Room |publisher=American Society of Plastic Surgeons |accessdate=31 August 2010}} --> BLACK LISTED</ref> The substance usually lasts six months and, sometimes, longer. While [[Juvederm]] is extremely chemically close to Restylane; many surgeons report the former is slightly smoother to inject.\n*'''[[Artecoll]]'''. Both Artecoll and ArteFill are not used to inject the body of the lips because the substance is heavy and would show as white through the thin skin of the lips. Additionally, both products contain tiny [[microspheres]] known as [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|PMMA]] (polymethylmethacrylate) which remain in the face permanently. In cases where Artecoll has been used around the edges of the lips to remove fine lines and wrinkles, some patients have reported annoying nodules or small lumps. In a few cases, surgery was required to remove the Artecoll.<ref>Blanchard, M. Filler material may cause nodules, lumps in lips. Cosmetic Surgery Times, 15 June, Issue, 2002</ref>\n\n==Non-surgical alternatives==\n*'''Lip plumper''' is a [[cosmetics|cosmetic]] product used to make lips appear fuller. These products work by irritating the skin of the lips with ingredients such as [[Capsaicin]].<ref name=plumper>{{cite web|last=Levitt|first=Shelly|title=Lip Plumpers: Do They Work?|url=http://www.webmd.com/beauty/lips-smile/bigger-lips-lip-plumping-products|publisher=Web MD|accessdate=28 June 2013}}</ref>  This makes the lips [[Swelling (medical)|swell]] slightly, temporarily creating the appearance of fuller lips. <ref name=plumper/>\n*'''Suction pumps''', a special device for lips uses vacuum pumping to increase blood pressure in each lip and to pull them out a bit, making it quite an instrument to adjust proper lip length/value in a slow determinite step-by-step way.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/beauty/how-to/a16971/beauty-bs-fullips/|title=Beauty or Bullsh*t? Lip-Plumping Suction Cup|date=10 December 2013|publisher=Cosmopolitan Magazine}}</ref>\n\n==Risks and side effects==\n\nSeveral studies have found fat grafting of the lip to be one of the best methods of maintaining a semi-permanent fuller and softer lip.<ref>Niechajev, Igor. Lip enhancement: surgical Alternatives and Histologic Aspects. Plastic & Reconstructive Surgery. 105(3):1173-1183, March 2000</ref> When the lips are overfilled, the results can be comic, often supplying fodder to [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] newspapers and offbeat websites. This look is sometimes mockingly called a 'trout pout.' Overaggressive injections can lead to lumpiness while too little can result in [[ridges]].    \n\nCommon reactions can range from redness, swelling or [[itching]] at the injection site(s). Other possible complications include [[bleeding]], uneven lips, [[Motion (physics)|movement]] of the implants or extrusion, when an [[implant (medicine)|implant]] breaks through the outermost surface of the skin. The usual, expected [[Swelling (medical)|swelling]] and [[bruising]] can last from several days to a week.\n\nSome patients are allergic to the common local anesthetics like [[lidocaine]] and probably should not consider lip injections. Some react badly to the skin test that patients must take before receiving collagen. Other patients who should forego procedures to the lip include those who have active skin conditions like [[cold sores]], blood [[clotting]] problems, [[infections]], scarring of the lips or certain diseases like [[diabetes]] or [[Systemic lupus erythematosus|lupus]] that cause slower healing. Patients with facial [[nerve]] disorders, severe [[hypertension]] or recurrent [[herpes simplex]] [[lesions]] should also eschew lip augmentation. As in all surgeries, [[smoking|smokers]] complicate completion of their procedure as well as the speed of [[healing]].\n\nFat transfer can last longer than other injected materials but can have lumping or scarring effects. The length of time a fat transfer may last in the lips is often determined by how much the area moves and how close it is to a major blood supply.  In addition, the donor fat must be harvested from another area of the patient's body which leaves another\u2014albeit tiny\u2014surgical [[wound]]. However, donor fat harvesting techniques have become extremely well refined.<ref>Coleman, SR. Long term survival for fat transplants: controlled demonstration. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery 2996; 19:421-425</ref>\n\n==Discussion==\nCosmetic surgery providers often advise their patients that many options now exist for improving the appearance of the lips.  Most practitioners also admit that successful lip augmentation is highly dependent on the skill of the provider, with that skill stemming from many years of experience injecting the lips of many types of patients. Moreover, the surgeon must master the various injection techniques. With many injectables, the benefit to the patient is an immediate return to normal, usual activities. A few surgeons offer a procedure known as surgical flap augmentations in which small sections of skin near the lips or inside the mouth are excised and added to the lips. But the technique does not add volume and achieves only a slight outward protrusion of the lips.<ref>Giovanie Botti, Rene Villedieu. Augmentation cheilopolasty by using mucomuscular flaps.

The [[Unification Decree (Spain, 1937)|1937 Unification Decree]], which merged all parties supporting the rebel side, led to Nationalist Spain becoming a single-party regime under the [[FET y de las JONS]]. The end of the war in 1939 brought the extension of the Franco rule to the whole country and the [[Spanish Republican government in exile|exile of Republican institutions]].

Nevertheless, Spain supported them in various ways throughout most of the war while maintaining its neutrality. Because of this, Spain was [[Pariah state|isolated]] by many other countries for nearly a decade after World War II, while its [[autarky|autarkic]] economy, still trying to recover from the civil war, suffered from chronic depression. The [[Law of Succession to the Headship of the State|1947 Law of Succession]] made Spain a ''de jure'' Kingdom again, but defined Franco as the Head of State for life with the power to choose the person to become [[King of Spain]] and his successor.\n\nReforms were implemented in the 1950s and Spain abandoned autarky, reassigned authority from the [[Falangism|Falangist movement]], which had been prone to isolationism, to a new breed of economists, the [[Technocracy|technocrats]] of [[Opus Dei and politics#Opus Dei members in Franco's government|Opus Dei]].<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/timreuter/2014/05/19/before-chinas-transformation-there-was-the-spanish-miracle/#f5da6133b3e1 | title= Before China's Transformation, There Was The 'Spanish Miracle'| work=Forbes Magazine | access-date=22 August 2017 | date=19 May 2014 | first=Tim | last=Reuter}}</ref> This led to massive economic growth, second only to [[Japanese economic miracle|Japan]], that lasted until the mid-1970s, known as the \"[[Spanish miracle]]\".

Franco was to be succeeded by [[Luis Carrero Blanco]] as Prime Minister with the intention of continuing the Francoist regime, but those hopes ended with his [[Assassination of Luis Carrero Blanco|1973 assassination]] by the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque]] separatist group [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]]. With the death of Franco on 20 November 1975, Juan Carlos became the [[King of Spain]]. He initiated the country's subsequent [[Spanish transition to democracy|transition to democracy]], ending with Spain becoming a [[constitutional monarchy]] with an [[parliamentary democracy|elected parliament]] and autonomous devolved governments.\n\n==Government==\n{{see|Movimiento Nacional}}\n\nAfter Franco's victory in 1939, the Falange was declared the sole legally sanctioned political party in Spain and it asserted itself as the main component of the National Movement. In a [[state of emergency]]-like status, Franco ruled with, on paper, more power than any Spanish leader before or since. He was not even required to consult his cabinet for most legislation.<ref>Payne, p. 231-234</ref> According to historian [[Stanley G. Payne]], Franco had more day-to-day power than [[Adolf Hitler]] or [[Joseph Stalin]] possessed at the respective heights of their power. Payne noted that Hitler and Stalin at least maintained rubber-stamp parliaments, while Franco dispensed with even that formality in the early years of his rule. According to Payne, the lack of even a rubber-stamp parliament made Franco's government \"the most purely arbitrary in the world.\"<ref>Payne, p. 323.</ref> The 100-member [[National Council of the Movement]] served as a makeshift legislature until the passing of the [[Organic law|organic law of 1942]] and the ''Ley Constitutiva de las Cortes'' (Constituent Law of the Cortes) the same year, which saw the grand opening of the [[Cortes Espa\u00f1olas]] on 18 July 1942.<ref>{{YouTube|e02yoA0vFwI}}</ref>\n\nThe Organic Law made the government ultimately responsible for passing all laws,<ref name=\"countrystudies.us\">{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/spain/22.htm|title=Spain - THE FRANCO YEARS|publisher=}}</ref> while defining the Cortes as a purely advisory body elected by neither direct nor universal suffrage. The Cortes had no power over government spending, and the government was not responsible to it; ministers were appointed and dismissed by Franco alone as the \"Chief\" of state and government. The ''Ley del Referendum Nacional'' (Law of the National Referendum), passed in 1945 approved for all \"fundamental laws\" to be approved by a popular referendum, in which only the heads of families could vote. Local municipal councils were appointed similarly by heads of families and local corporations through [[Municipal electoral regime during Francoism|local municipal elections]] while mayors were appointed by the government. It was thus one of the most centralised countries in Europe and certainly the most centralised in Western Europe following the fall of the Portuguese ''[[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]]'' in the [[Carnation Revolution]].\n\nThe referendum law was used twice during Franco's rule\u2014in 1947, when a [[Spanish law of succession referendum, 1947|referendum revived the Spanish monarchy]] with Franco as ''de facto'' regent for life with sole right to appoint his successor; and in 1966, another [[Spanish organic law referendum, 1966|referendum]] was held to approve a new \"[[Organic Law of the State|organic law]]\", or constitution, supposedly limiting and clearly defining Franco's powers as well as formally creating the modern office of [[Prime Minister of Spain]]. By delaying the issue of republic versus monarchy for his 36-year dictatorship and by refusing to take up the throne himself in 1947, Franco sought to antagonise neither the monarchical Carlists (who preferred the restoration of a Bourbon) nor the republican \"old shirts\" (original Falangists). Franco ignored the claim to the throne of [[Infante Juan, Count of Barcelona]], son of the last king, [[Alfonso XIII]], who designated him as his heir; Franco found him too liberal. In 1961, Franco offered [[Otto von Habsburg]] the throne, but was refused and ultimately followed Otto's recommendation by selecting in 1969 the young [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos of Bourbon]], son of Infante Juan, as his officially designated heir to the throne, shortly after his 30th birthday (the minimum age required under the Law of Succession).\n\nIn 1973, due to old age and to lessen his burdens in governing Spain he resigned as Prime Minister and named Navy Admiral [[Luis Carrero Blanco]] to the said post, but Franco remained as the Chief of State, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces and ''Jefe del Movimiento'' (Chief of the Movement). However, Carrero Blanco was assassinated in the same year and [[Carlos Arias Navarro]] became the country's new Prime Minister.\n\n==Armed forces==\nDuring the first year of peace, Franco dramatically reduced the size of the [[Spanish Army]]\u2014from almost one million at the end of the Civil War to {{formatnum:250000}} in early 1940, with most soldiers two-year conscripts.<ref name=\"Bowen and \u00c1lvarez\">{{cite book|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|pages=114|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qY94qFszWq8C&pg=PA13|isbn=978-0-275-99357-3|last=Bowen|first=Wayne H.|author2=Jos\u00e9 E. \u00c1lvarez|title=A Military History of Modern Spain|year=2007}}</ref> Concerns about the international situation, Spain's possible entry into World War II and threats of invasion led him to undo some of these reductions.

During the [[Algerian War]] (1954\u20131962), Madrid became the base of the ''[[Organisation arm\u00e9e secr\u00e8te]]'' right-wing French Army group which sought to preserve [[French rule in Algeria|French Algeria]]. Despite this, Franco was forced to make some concessions. When the [[French protectorate in Morocco]] became independent in 1956, Spain surrendered its [[Spanish protectorate in Morocco]] to [[Mohammed V of Morocco|Mohammed V]], retaining only a few exclaves, the ''[[Plazas de soberan\u00eda]]''. The year after, Mohammed V invaded [[Spanish Sahara]] during the [[Ifni War]] (known as the \"Forgotten War\" in Spain). Only in 1975, with the [[Green March]] and the military occupation, did Morocco take control of all of the former Spanish territories in the Sahara.\n\nIn 1968, under [[United Nations]] pressure Franco granted Spain's colony of [[Equatorial Guinea]] its independence and the next year ceded the exclave of [[Ifni]] to [[Morocco]]. Under Franco, Spain also pursued a campaign to gain sovereignty of the British overseas territory of [[Gibraltar]] and closed its border in 1969. The border would not be fully reopened until 1985.\n\n==Francoism==\n{{distinguish|Frankism}}\n{{Francoism sidebar}}\n{{Falangism sidebar}}\nThe consistent points in Francoism included above all [[authoritarianism]], [[Spanish nationalism]], [[national Catholicism]], [[monarchism]], [[militarism]], [[national conservatism]], [[anti-Masonry]], [[anti-Catalanism]], [[Panhispanism|pan-Hispanism]] and [[anti-liberalism]]\u2014some authors also include [[integralism]].<ref>Unearthing Franco's Legacy, p 31, and Paul Preston, \"The Theorists of extermination\" essay in ''Unearthing Franco's Legacy'',  pp&nbsp;42\u201367 University of Notre Dame Press {{ISBN|0-268-03268-8}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/fundamentalismin00lawr_0|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/fundamentalismin00lawr_0/page/87 87]|quote=franco integralism.|title=Fundamentalism in Comparative Perspective|publisher=Univ of Massachusetts Press|isbn=0870237985|last1=Kaplan|first1=Lawrence|year=1992}}</ref> [[Stanley Payne]], a scholar of Spain notes that \"scarcely any of the serious historians and analysts of Franco consider the ''generalissimo'' to be a core fascist\".<ref name=autogenerated1>Payne, Stanley [https://archive.org/details/fascisminspain1900payn ''Fascism in Spain, 1923\u20131977''], p. 476 1999 Univ. of Wisconsin Press</ref><ref>Laqueur, Walter [https://books.google.com/books?id=fWggQTqioXcC&dq ''Fascism: Past, Present, Future''], p. 13, 1997 Oxford University Press US</ref> According to historian [[Walter Laqueur]] \"during the Civil War, Spanish fascists were forced to subordinate their activities to the nationalist cause.

In April 1937, the ''Falange Espa\u00f1ola Tradicionalista y de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional Sindicalista'' (Traditionalist Spanish Phalanx and of the Councils of National Syndicalist Offensive) was created from the absorption of the [[Traditionalist Communion|''Comuni\u00f3n Tradicionalista'']] (Traditionalist Communion) by the ''Falange Espa\u00f1ola de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional Sindicalista'', which itself was the result of an earlier absorption of the ''[[Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista]]'' by Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera's ''Falange Espa\u00f1ola''. This party, often referred to as Falange, became the sole legal party during Franco's regime, but the term \"party\" was generally avoided, especially after World War II, when it was commonly referred to as the \"National Movement\" or just as \"the Movement\".\n\n===Authoritarianism===\nThe main point of those scholars that tend to consider the Spanish State to be authoritarian rather than fascist is that the FET-JONS were relatively heterogeneous rather than being an ideological monolith.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/><ref name=\"Franco and the Spanish Civil War\">De Menses, Filipe Ribeiro [https://books.google.com/books?id=InPG_1wKfCIC&dq Franco and the Spanish Civil War], p. 87, Routledge</ref><ref name=\"books.google.com\">Gilmour, David, [https://archive.org/details/transformationof00gilm The Transformation of Spain: From Franco to the Constitutional Monarchy], p. 7 1985 Quartet Books</ref><ref name=\"Fascism in Spain, 1923\u20131977\">Payne, Stanley [https://archive.org/details/fascisminspain1900payn Fascism in Spain, 1923\u20131977], p. 347, 476 1999 Univ. of Wisconsin Press</ref><ref name=\"Fascism: Past, Present, Future\">Laqueur, Walter [https://books.google.com/books?id=fWggQTqioXcC&dq Fascism: Past, Present, Future] p. 13 1996 Oxford University Press</ref> After World War II, the Falange opposed free capital markets, but the ultimately prevailing [[Technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocrats]], some of whom were linked with [[Opus Dei]], eschewed syndicalist economics and favoured increased competition as a means of achieving rapid economic growth and integration with wider Europe.<ref>\"The Franco Years: Policies, Programs, and Growing Popular Unrest.\" ''A Country Study: Spain'' <http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/estoc.html#es0034></ref>\n\nThe Spanish State was authoritarian: Non-government [[trade union]]s and all political opponents across the [[political spectrum]] were either suppressed or controlled by all means, including police repression.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} Most country towns and rural areas were patrolled by pairs of ''[[Civil Guard (Spain)|Guardia Civil]]'', a military police for civilians, which functioned as a chief means of social control.

The [[Basque Nationalist Party]] (PNV) went into exile and in 1959 the armed separatist group [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] was created to wage a [[low-intensity warfare|low-intensity war]] against Franco. Like others at the time, Franco evinced a concern about a possible [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] and [[List of conspiracy theories|Judaic conspiracy]] against his regime.\n\nFranco continued to personally sign all death warrants until [[Last use of capital punishment in Spain|just months before he died]] despite international campaigns requesting him to desist.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\n===Spanish nationalism===\n[[File:Francoist demonstration in Salamanca.jpg|thumb|Francoist demonstration in [[Salamanca]] in 1937]]\nFranco's Spanish nationalism promoted a unitary national identity by repressing Spain's cultural diversity. [[Bullfighting]] and [[flamenco]]<ref>Roman, Mar. \"Spain frets over future of flamenco.\" 27 October 2007. Associated Press. [https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20071027/ap_en_mu/flamenco_for_foreigners]</ref> were promoted as national traditions, while those traditions not considered Spanish were suppressed. Franco's view of Spanish tradition was somewhat artificial and arbitrary: while some regional traditions were suppressed, Flamenco, an [[Andalusia]]n tradition, was considered part of a larger, national identity. All cultural activities were subject to [[censorship]] and many were forbidden entirely, often in an erratic manner. This cultural policy relaxed over time, most notably in the late 1960s and early 1970s.\n\nFranco was reluctant to enact any form of administrative and legislative decentralisation and kept a fully centralised form of government with a similar administrative structure to that established by the [[House of Bourbon]] and General [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]]. These structures were modelled after the centralised French state. As a result of this type of governance, government attention and initiatives were irregular and often depended more on the goodwill of government representatives than on regional needs. Thus inequalities in schooling, health care or transport facilities among regions were patent: historically affluent regions like [[Madrid]], [[Catalonia]] or the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] fared much better than others such as [[Extremadura]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] or [[Andalusia]].\n\nFranco eliminated the autonomy granted by the [[Second Spanish Republic]] to the regions and abolished the centuries-old fiscal privileges and autonomy (the [[fueros]]) in two of the three Basque provinces: [[Gipuzkoa|Guipuzcoa]] and [[Biscay]], which were officially classified as \"traitor regions\". The fueros were kept in the third Basque province, [[Alava]], and also in [[Navarre]], a former kingdom during the Middle Ages and the cradle of the Carlists, possibly due to the region's support during the Civil War.\n\nFranco also used [[Language politics in Spain under Franco|language politics]] in an attempt to establish national homogeneity. Despite Franco himself being Galician, the government revoked the official statute and recognition for the [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Galician language|Galician]] and [[Catalan language|Catalan]] languages that the Republic had granted them for the first time in the history of Spain. The former policy of promoting [[Spanish language|Spanish]] as the only official language of the state and education was resumed, even though millions of the country's citizens spoke other languages. The legal usage of languages other than Spanish was forbidden: all government, notarial, legal and commercial documents were to be drawn up exclusively in Spanish and any written in other languages were deemed null and void. The use of any other language was forbidden in schools, advertising, religious ceremonies and on road and shop signs. Publications in other languages were generally forbidden, though citizens continued to use them privately. During the late 1960s, these policies became more lenient yet non-Castilian languages continued to be discouraged and did not receive official status or legal recognition. Additionally, the popularisation of the compulsory national educational system and the development of modern mass media, both controlled by the state and exclusively in Spanish, reduced the competency of speakers of Basque, Catalan and Galician.\n\n===Roman Catholicism===\nAlthough Franco himself was previously known for not being very devout,<ref>Vi\u00f1as, \u00c1. (2012). En el combate por la historia: la Rep\u00fablica, la guerra civil, el franquismo.</ref> his regime often used religion as a means to increase its popularity throughout the Catholic world, especially after the Second World War. Franco himself was increasingly portrayed as a fervent Catholic and a staunch defender of Roman Catholicism, the declared state religion. The regime favoured very conservative Roman Catholicism and it reversed the secularisation process that had taken place under the Republic. According to historian [[Juli\u00e1n Casanova Ruiz|Julian Casanova]], \"the symbiosis of religion, fatherland and Caudillo\" saw the Church assume great political responsibilities, \"a hegemony and monopoly beyond its wildest dreams\" and it played \"a central role in policing the country's citizens\".<ref>Julian Casanova, Professor of Contemporary History at the University of Zaragoza, ''The Faces of Terror'', in Unearthing Franco's Legacy, p.108</ref>\n\n[[File:Francisco Franco en la iglesia de Santa Mar\u00eda durante la celebraci\u00f3n de la Salve (5 de 9) - Fondo Car-Kutxa Fototeka.jpg|thumb|Franco with Catholic Church dignitaries in 1946]]\nThe [[Law of Political Responsibility]] of February 1939 turned the Church into an extralegal body of investigation as parishes were granted policing powers equal to those of local government officials and leaders of the Falange. Some official jobs required a \"good behaviour\" statement by a priest. According to historian Julian Casanova, \"the reports that have survived reveal a clergy that was bitter because of the violent anti-clericalism and the unacceptable level of secularisation that Spanish society had reached during the republican years\" and the law of 1939 made the priests investigators of peoples' ideological and political pasts.<ref>Unearthing Franco's Legacy, p. 108/1115</ref>\n\nThe authorities encouraged denunciations in the workplace. For example, Barcelona's city hall obliged all government functionaries to \"tell the proper authorities who the leftists are in your department and everything you know about their activities\". A law passed in 1939 institutionalised the purging of public offices.<ref>Unearthing Franco's Legacy, p.103</ref> The poet [[Carlos Barral]] recorded that in his family \"any allusion to republican relatives was scrupulously avoided; everyone took part in the enthusiasm for the new era and wrapped themselves in the folds of religiosity\". Only through silence could people associated with the Republic be relatively safe from imprisonment or unemployment. After the death of Franco, the price of the peaceful transition to democracy would be silence and \"the tacit agreement to forget the past\",<ref>Unearthing Franco's Legacy p. 128\u2013129, Michael Richards ''Grand Narratives, Collective Memory, and Social History''.</ref> which was given legal status by the 1977 [[Pact of forgetting]].\n\n[[Civil marriage]]s that had taken place in the Republic were declared null and void unless they had been validated by the Church, along with divorces.

He had no particular desire for a king because of his strained relations with the legitimist heir to the Crown, Juan of Bourbon. Therefore, he left the throne vacant with himself as regent and set the basis for his succession. This gesture was largely done to appease monarchist factions within the Movement. At the same time, Franco wore the uniform of a captain general (a rank traditionally reserved for the King), resided in the [[Royal Palace of El Pardo]], appropriated the kingly privilege of walking beneath a [[Baldachin|canopy]] and his portrait appeared on most Spanish coins. Indeed, although his formal titles were ''Jefe del Estado'' (Head of State) and ''[[Generalissimo|General\u00edsimo de los Ej\u00e9rcitos Espa\u00f1oles]]'' (Generalissimo of the Spanish Armies), he was referred to as [[Caudillo|Caudillo of Spain]], [[by the Grace of God]]. ''Por la Gracia de Dios'' is a technical, legal formulation which states sovereign dignity in [[absolute monarchy|absolute monarchies]] and had been used only by monarchs before.\n\nThe long-delayed selection of Juan Carlos of Bourbon as Franco's official successor in 1969 was an unpleasant surprise for many interested parties as Juan Carlos was the rightful heir for neither the Carlists nor the Legitimists.{{Citation needed|reason=21-9-2009|date=September 2009}}\n\n==Narrative of the Civil War==\n{{See also|Spanish Civil War}}\nFor nearly twenty years after the war, Francoist Spain presented the conflict as a crusade against Bolshevism in defense of Christian civilization. In Francoist narrative, authoritarianism had defeated anarchy and overseen the elimination of \"agitators\", those \"without God\" and the \"[[Judeo-Masonic conspiracy theory|Judeo-Masonic conspiracy]]\". Since Franco had relied on thousands of North African soldiers, anti-Islamic sentiment \"was played down but the centuries old myth of the Moorish threat lay at the base of the construction of the \"communist menace\" as a modern-day Eastern plague\".<ref>Michael Richards, <nowiki>''Unearthing Franco's Legacy''</nowiki>, p. 129.</ref> The official position was therefore that the wartime Republic was simply a proto-Stalinist monolith, its leaders intent on creating a Spanish Soviet satellite. The anti-communist crusade narrative still exists both as \"a minority academic history\" and in media friendly, politically oriented productions ([[Stanley Payne]]/[[Pio Moa]]). This discourse obscured the social roots of the war and analysis of its origins. Many Spanish children grew up believing the war was fought against foreigners and the painter [[Julian Grau Santos]] has said \"it was instilled in me and I always believed that Spain had won the war against foreign enemies of our historic greatness\".{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} About {{formatnum:6832}} Catholic clergy were murdered by the Republicans.<ref>Julio de la Cueva, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/261121 \"Religious Persecution, Anticlerical Tradition and Revolution: On Atrocities against the Clergy during the Spanish Civil War\"] ''Journal of Contemporary History'' 33.3 (July 1998): 355.</ref> Collectively, they are known as the [[martyrs of the Spanish Civil War]].<ref name=\"Butler's Lives of the Saints\">Butler, Alban and Peter Doyle [https://books.google.com/books?id=PBGzh1JK2gUC&pg=PA169 Butler's Lives of the Saints] p. 169 Liturgical Press (February 2000).</ref>\n\n==Media==\nUnder the 1938 Press Law, all newspapers were put under [[Censorship|prior censorship]] and were forced to include any articles the government desired. Chief editors were nominated by the government and all journalists were required to be registered. All liberal, republican and left-wing media were prohibited.\n\nThe ''Delegaci\u00f3n Nacional de Prensa y Propaganda'' was established as a network of government media, including daily newspapers ''[[Arriba (newspaper)|Diario Arriba]]'' and ''Pueblo''. The ''[[EFE]]'' and Pyresa government news agencies were created in 1939 and 1945. The ''[[Radio Nacional de Espa\u00f1a]]'' state radio had the exclusive right to transmit news bulletins, which all broadcasters were required to air. The [[No-Do]] were 10-minute newsreels shown at all cinemas. The ''[[Televisi\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola]]'', the government television network, debuted in 1956.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church had its own media outlets, including the Ya newspaper and the ''[[Cadena COPE]]'' radio network. Other pro-government media included ''[[Cadena SER]]'', ''[[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]]'', ''[[La Vanguardia|La Vanguardia Espa\u00f1ola]]'', ''[[El Correo]]'' and ''[[El Diario Vasco]]''.\n\nNotable independent media outlets included humor magazine ''La Codorniz''.\n\nThe 1966 Press Law dropped the prior censorship regime and allowed media outlets to select their own directors, although criticism was still a crime.\n\n==Economic policy==\n{{See also|Economic history of Spain#The Franco Era, 1939\u201375}}\nThe Civil War had ravaged the Spanish economy. Infrastructure had been damaged, workers killed and daily business severely hampered. For more than a decade after Franco's victory, the economy improved little. Franco initially pursued a policy of [[autarky]], cutting off almost all international trade.  The policy had devastating effects and the economy stagnated. Only black marketeers could enjoy an evident affluence.<ref>{{cite book|last=S\u00e1nchez|first=Antonio Cazorla|title=Fear and Progress: Ordinary Lives in Franco's Spain, 1939\u20131975|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nGeHYYnODJ4C&pg=PA58&lpg=PA58#v=onepage&q&f=false|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|accessdate=23 April 2013|pages=58\u201360|date=July 2010|isbn=9781444306507}}</ref>\n\nIn 1940, the ''[[Spanish Labour Organization|Sindicato Vertical]]'' was created. It was inspired by the ideas of Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera, who thought that [[class struggle]] would be ended by grouping together workers and owners according to [[Corporate statism|corporative]] principles. It was the only legal trade union and was under government control. Other trade unions were forbidden and strongly repressed along with political parties outside the Falange.\n\nOn the brink of bankruptcy, a combination of pressure from the United States, the IMF and technocrats from Opus Dei managed to \"convince\" the regime to adopt a free market economy in 1959 in what amounted to a mini coup d'\u00e9tat which removed the old guard in charge of the economy, despite the opposition of Franco. However, this economic liberalisation was not accompanied by political reforms and oppression continued unabated.\n\nEconomic growth picked up after 1959 after Franco took authority away from these ideologues and gave more power to the [[Economic liberalism|liberal]] technocrats. The country implemented several development policies and growth took off creating the \"[[Spanish Miracle]]\". Concurrent with the absence of social reforms and the economic power shift, a tide of mass emigration commenced to European countries and to lesser extent to South America. Emigration helped the regime in two ways: the country got rid of surplus population and the emigrants supplied the country with much needed monetary remittances.\n\nDuring the 1960s, Spain experienced further increases in wealth. International firms established their factories in Spain: salaries were low, taxes nearly nonexistent, strikes were forbidden, labour health or real state regulations were unheard of and Spain was virtually a virgin market. Spain became the second fastest-growing economy in the world, just behind [[Japan]]. The rapid development of this period became known as the \"Spanish Miracle\". At the time of Franco's death, Spain still lagged behind most of Western Europe, but the gap between its GDP per capita and that of the major Western European economies had greatly narrowed. In world terms, Spain was already enjoying a fairly high material standard of living with basic but comprehensive services. However, the period between the mid-1970s and mid-1980s was to prove difficult as in addition to the [[1970s energy crisis|oil shocks]] to which Spain was highly exposed, the settling of the new political order took priority over the modernising of the economy.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\n==Legacy==\n{{Further|Pact of forgetting}}\n[[File:SPA-2014-San Lorenzo de El Escorial-Valley of the Fallen (Valle de los Ca\u00eddos).jpg|thumb|By decision of [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|King Juan Carlos I]], Franco was entombed in the monument of [[Valle de los Ca\u00eddos]], until his body was moved in October 2019.<ref name=\"bbc._Spai\">{{Cite web |title=Spain relocates dictator Franco's remains |author= |work=BBC News |date= |access-date=4 November 2019 |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-50164806}}</ref>]]\n[[File:Francoayto.jpg|thumb|Equestrian statue of [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] in the ''[[List of equestrian statues in Spain|Plaza del Ayuntamiento]]'' of [[Santander, Spain|Santander]], taken down in late 2008]]\nIn Spain and abroad, the legacy of Franco remains controversial.

The new arms were allegedly inspired in the coat of arms the [[Catholic Monarchs]] adopted after the taking of [[Emirate of Granada]] from the Moors, but replacing the arms of [[Sicily]] with those of Navarre and adding the [[Pillars of Hercules]] on either side of the coat of arms. In 1938, the columns were placed outside the wings. On 26 July 1945, the commander's ensigns were suppressed by decree and on 11 October a detailed regulation of flags was published that fixed the model of the bi-colour flag in use, but better defined its details, emphasising a greater{{clarify|date=September 2011}} style of the Saint John's eagle. The models established by this decree remained in force until 1977.\n\nDuring this period, two more flags were usually displayed along with the national flag: the flag of Falange (red, black and red vertical stripes, with the [[Yoke and arrows|yokes and arrows]] in the centre of the black stripe) and the traditionalist flag (white background with the [[Cross of Burgundy Flag|Cross of Burgundy]] in the middle), representing the National Movement which had unified Falange and the [[Requet\u00e9s]] under the name ''Falange Espa\u00f1ola Tradicionalista y de las JONS''.\n\nFrom the death of Franco in 1975 until 1977, the national flag followed the 1945 regulations. On 21 January 1977, a new regulation was approved that stipulated an eagle with more open wings, with the restored Pillars of Hercules placed within the wings and the tape with the motto ''\"[[Una, Grande y Libre]]\"'' (\"One, Great and Free\") moved over the eagle's head from its previous position around the neck.\n\n<center>\n<gallery caption=\"State flags\">\nFile:Bandera del bando nacional 1936-1938.svg|[[Flag of Spain#Spanish State|State flag]] (1936&ndash;1938)\nFile:Flag of Spain (1938 - 1945).svg|[[Flag of Spain#Spanish State|State flag]] (1938&ndash;1945)\nFile:Flag of Spain (1945 - 1977).svg|[[Flag of Spain#Spanish State|State flag]] (1945&ndash;1977)\nFile:Flag of Spain (Civil) alternate colours.svg|[[Flag of Spain|Civil flag]] (1936&ndash;1975)\n</gallery>\n<gallery caption=\"Party flags\">\nFile:Bandera FE JONS.svg|Flag of the [[FET y de las JONS|Falange Movement]]\nFile:Flag of Traditionalist Requetes.svg|Flag of the [[Carlism|Traditionalist Movement (Carlism)]]\n</gallery>\n</center>\n\n===Standards===\n{{See also|Royal Bend of Castile|Royal Standard of Spain}}\nFrom 1940 to 1975, Franco used the [[Royal Bend of Castile]] as Head of State's [[Military colours, standards and guidons|standard and guidon]]: the Bend between the Pillars of Hercules, crowned with an imperial crown and open royal crown.\n\nAs [[Prince of Spain]] from 1969 to 1975, Juan Carlos used a royal standard which was virtually identical to the one later adopted when he became King in 1975.

Months after the start of the [[Spanish Civil War]] in July 1936, Franco emerged as the dominant rebel military leader and was proclaimed Head of State on 1 October 1936, ruling a [[dictatorship]] over the territory controlled by the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalist faction]]. The [[Unification Decree (Spain, 1937)|1937 Unification Decree]], which merged all parties supporting the rebel side, led to Nationalist Spain becoming a single-party regime under the [[FET y de las JONS]]. The end of the war in 1939 brought the extension of the Franco rule to the whole country and the [[Spanish Republican government in exile|exile of Republican institutions]]. The Francoist dictatorship originally took a form described as \"fascistized dictatorship\",{{Sfn|Saz Campos|2004|p=90}} or \"semi-fascist regime\",<ref name=payne /> showing clear influence of [[fascism]] in fields such as [[Spanish Labour Organization|labor relations]], the [[autarky|autarkic]] [[Economic history of Spain#The Franco Era, 1939\u201375|economic policy]], [[Symbols of Francoism|aesthetics]], or the [[one party system|single-party system]].{{Sfn|Moradiellos|2000|p=20}}<ref>{{Harvsp|Cabrera|Rey|2017}}; Cap\u00edtulo V</ref> As time went on, the regime opened up and became closer to developmental dictatorships, although it always preserved residual fascist trappings.<ref>\u00abLa ausencia de un ideario definido le permiti\u00f3 transitar de unas f\u00f3rmulas dictatoriales a otras, rozando el fascismo en los cuarenta y a las dictaduras desarrollistas en los sesenta\u00bb.{{harvnb|Tusell|1999}}, cap. \u00abEl franquismo como dictadura\u00bb.</ref><ref name=payne>\u00abLa tesis defendida por Payne en dicho dossier puede sintetizarse con estas palabras:\n{{cita|Entre 1937 y 1943, el franquismo constituy\u00f3 un r\u00e9gimen \"semi-fascista\", pero nunca un r\u00e9gimen fascista cien por cien.

Nevertheless, Spain supported them in various ways throughout most of the war while maintaining its neutrality. Because of this, Spain was [[Pariah state|isolated]] by many other countries for nearly a decade after World War II, while its [[autarky|autarkic]] economy, still trying to recover from the civil war, suffered from chronic depression. The [[Law of Succession to the Headship of the State|1947 Law of Succession]] made Spain a ''de jure'' Kingdom again, but defined Franco as the Head of State for life with the power to choose the person to become [[King of Spain]] and his successor.\n\nReforms were implemented in the 1950s and Spain abandoned autarky, reassigned authority from the [[Falangism|Falangist movement]], which had been prone to isolationism, to a new breed of economists, the [[Technocracy|technocrats]] of [[Opus Dei and politics#Opus Dei members in Franco's government|Opus Dei]].<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/timreuter/2014/05/19/before-chinas-transformation-there-was-the-spanish-miracle/#f5da6133b3e1 | title= Before China's Transformation, There Was The 'Spanish Miracle'| work=Forbes Magazine | access-date=22 August 2017 | date=19 May 2014 | first=Tim | last=Reuter}}</ref> This led to massive economic growth, second only to [[Japanese economic miracle|Japan]], that lasted until the mid-1970s, known as the \"[[Spanish miracle]]\".

Franco was to be succeeded by [[Luis Carrero Blanco]] as Prime Minister with the intention of continuing the Francoist regime, but those hopes ended with his [[Assassination of Luis Carrero Blanco|1973 assassination]] by the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque]] separatist group [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]]. With the death of Franco on 20 November 1975, Juan Carlos became the [[King of Spain]]. He initiated the country's subsequent [[Spanish transition to democracy|transition to democracy]], ending with Spain becoming a [[constitutional monarchy]] with an [[parliamentary democracy|elected parliament]] and autonomous devolved governments.\n\n==Government==\n{{see|Movimiento Nacional}}\n\nAfter Franco's victory in 1939, the Falange was declared the sole legally sanctioned political party in Spain and it asserted itself as the main component of the National Movement. In a [[state of emergency]]-like status, Franco ruled with, on paper, more power than any Spanish leader before or since. He was not even required to consult his cabinet for most legislation.<ref>Payne, p. 231-234</ref> According to historian [[Stanley G. Payne]], Franco had more day-to-day power than [[Adolf Hitler]] or [[Joseph Stalin]] possessed at the respective heights of their power. Payne noted that Hitler and Stalin at least maintained rubber-stamp parliaments, while Franco dispensed with even that formality in the early years of his rule. According to Payne, the lack of even a rubber-stamp parliament made Franco's government \"the most purely arbitrary in the world.\"<ref>Payne, p. 323.</ref> The 100-member [[National Council of the Movement]] served as a makeshift legislature until the passing of the [[Organic law|organic law of 1942]] and the ''Ley Constitutiva de las Cortes'' (Constituent Law of the Cortes) the same year, which saw the grand opening of the [[Cortes Espa\u00f1olas]] on 18 July 1942.<ref>{{YouTube|e02yoA0vFwI}}</ref>\n\nThe Organic Law made the government ultimately responsible for passing all laws,<ref name=\"countrystudies.us\">{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/spain/22.htm|title=Spain - THE FRANCO YEARS|publisher=}}</ref> while defining the Cortes as a purely advisory body elected by neither direct nor universal suffrage. The Cortes had no power over government spending, and the government was not responsible to it; ministers were appointed and dismissed by Franco alone as the \"Chief\" of state and government. The ''Ley del Referendum Nacional'' (Law of the National Referendum), passed in 1945 approved for all \"fundamental laws\" to be approved by a popular referendum, in which only the heads of families could vote. Local municipal councils were appointed similarly by heads of families and local corporations through [[Municipal electoral regime during Francoism|local municipal elections]] while mayors were appointed by the government. It was thus one of the most centralised countries in Europe and certainly the most centralised in Western Europe following the fall of the Portuguese ''[[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]]'' in the [[Carnation Revolution]].\n\nThe referendum law was used twice during Franco's rule\u2014in 1947, when a [[Spanish law of succession referendum, 1947|referendum revived the Spanish monarchy]] with Franco as ''de facto'' regent for life with sole right to appoint his successor; and in 1966, another [[Spanish organic law referendum, 1966|referendum]] was held to approve a new \"[[Organic Law of the State|organic law]]\", or constitution, supposedly limiting and clearly defining Franco's powers as well as formally creating the modern office of [[Prime Minister of Spain]]. By delaying the issue of republic versus monarchy for his 36-year dictatorship and by refusing to take up the throne himself in 1947, Franco sought to antagonise neither the monarchical Carlists (who preferred the restoration of a Bourbon) nor the republican \"old shirts\" (original Falangists). Franco ignored the claim to the throne of [[Infante Juan, Count of Barcelona]], son of the last king, [[Alfonso XIII]], who designated him as his heir; Franco found him too liberal. In 1961, Franco offered [[Otto von Habsburg]] the throne, but was refused and ultimately followed Otto's recommendation by selecting in 1969 the young [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos of Bourbon]], son of Infante Juan, as his officially designated heir to the throne, shortly after his 30th birthday (the minimum age required under the Law of Succession).\n\nIn 1973, due to old age and to lessen his burdens in governing Spain he resigned as Prime Minister and named Navy Admiral [[Luis Carrero Blanco]] to the said post, but Franco remained as the Chief of State, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces and ''Jefe del Movimiento'' (Chief of the Movement). However, Carrero Blanco was assassinated in the same year and [[Carlos Arias Navarro]] became the country's new Prime Minister.\n\n==Armed forces==\nDuring the first year of peace, Franco dramatically reduced the size of the [[Spanish Army]]\u2014from almost one million at the end of the Civil War to {{formatnum:250000}} in early 1940, with most soldiers two-year conscripts.<ref name=\"Bowen and \u00c1lvarez\">{{cite book|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|pages=114|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qY94qFszWq8C&pg=PA13|isbn=978-0-275-99357-3|last=Bowen|first=Wayne H.|author2=Jos\u00e9 E. \u00c1lvarez|title=A Military History of Modern Spain|year=2007}}</ref> Concerns about the international situation, Spain's possible entry into World War II and threats of invasion led him to undo some of these reductions.

During the [[Algerian War]] (1954\u20131962), Madrid became the base of the ''[[Organisation arm\u00e9e secr\u00e8te]]'' right-wing French Army group which sought to preserve [[French rule in Algeria|French Algeria]]. Despite this, Franco was forced to make some concessions. When the [[French protectorate in Morocco]] became independent in 1956, Spain surrendered its [[Spanish protectorate in Morocco]] to [[Mohammed V of Morocco|Mohammed V]], retaining only a few exclaves, the ''[[Plazas de soberan\u00eda]]''. The year after, Mohammed V invaded [[Spanish Sahara]] during the [[Ifni War]] (known as the \"Forgotten War\" in Spain). Only in 1975, with the [[Green March]] and the military occupation, did Morocco take control of all of the former Spanish territories in the Sahara.\n\nIn 1968, under [[United Nations]] pressure Franco granted Spain's colony of [[Equatorial Guinea]] its independence and the next year ceded the exclave of [[Ifni]] to [[Morocco]]. Under Franco, Spain also pursued a campaign to gain sovereignty of the British overseas territory of [[Gibraltar]] and closed its border in 1969.

The Falange became junior partners in the government and, as such, they had to accept responsibility for the regime's policy without being able to shape it substantially\".<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?hl=es&id=fWggQTqioXcC&q=spanish+fascism#v=snippet&q=spanish%20fascism&f=false ''Fascism: Past, Present, Future''.] Google Books.</ref> The [[United Nations Security Council]] voted in 1946 to deny the Franco regime recognition until it developed a more representative government.<ref>[[Michael Burleigh]], ''Sacred Causes'', p. 316, 2006, HarperPress, {{ISBN|0-00-719574-5}}; see also [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 7]]</ref>\n\n===Development===\nThe Falange Espa\u00f1ola de las JONS, a fascist party formed during the Republic, soon transformed itself into the framework of reference in the National Movement. In April 1937, the ''Falange Espa\u00f1ola Tradicionalista y de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional Sindicalista'' (Traditionalist Spanish Phalanx and of the Councils of National Syndicalist Offensive) was created from the absorption of the [[Traditionalist Communion|''Comuni\u00f3n Tradicionalista'']] (Traditionalist Communion) by the ''Falange Espa\u00f1ola de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional Sindicalista'', which itself was the result of an earlier absorption of the ''[[Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista]]'' by Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera's ''Falange Espa\u00f1ola''. This party, often referred to as Falange, became the sole legal party during Franco's regime, but the term \"party\" was generally avoided, especially after World War II, when it was commonly referred to as the \"National Movement\" or just as \"the Movement\".\n\n===Authoritarianism===\nThe main point of those scholars who tend to consider the Spanish State to be authoritarian rather than fascist is that the FET-JONS were relatively heterogeneous rather than being an ideological monolith.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/><ref name=\"Franco and the Spanish Civil War\">De Menses, Filipe Ribeiro [https://books.google.com/books?id=InPG_1wKfCIC&dq Franco and the Spanish Civil War], p. 87, Routledge</ref><ref name=\"books.google.com\">Gilmour, David, [https://archive.org/details/transformationof00gilm The Transformation of Spain: From Franco to the Constitutional Monarchy], p. 7 1985 Quartet Books</ref><ref name=\"Fascism in Spain, 1923\u20131977\">Payne, Stanley [https://archive.org/details/fascisminspain1900payn Fascism in Spain, 1923\u20131977], p. 347, 476 1999 Univ. of Wisconsin Press</ref><ref name=\"Fascism: Past, Present, Future\">Laqueur, Walter [https://books.google.com/books?id=fWggQTqioXcC&dq Fascism: Past, Present, Future] p. 13 1996 Oxford University Press</ref> After World War II, the Falange opposed free capital markets, but the ultimately prevailing [[Technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocrats]], some of whom were linked with [[Opus Dei]], eschewed syndicalist economics and favoured increased competition as a means of achieving rapid economic growth and integration with wider Europe.<ref>\"The Franco Years: Policies, Programs, and Growing Popular Unrest.\" ''A Country Study: Spain'' <http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/estoc.html#es0034></ref>\n\nThe Spanish State was authoritarian: non-government [[trade union]]s and all political opponents across the [[political spectrum]] were either suppressed or controlled by all means, including police repression.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} Most country towns and rural areas were patrolled by pairs of ''[[Civil Guard (Spain)|Guardia Civil]]'', a military police for civilians, which functioned as a chief means of social control. Larger cities, and capitals, were mostly under the heavily armed ''[[Armed Police Corps|Polic\u00eda Armada]]'', commonly called ''grises'' due to their grey uniforms. Franco was also the focus of a [[personality cult]] which taught that he had been sent by [[Divine Providence]] to save the country from chaos and poverty.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nMembers of the oppressed ranged from Catholic trade unions to [[communism|communist]] and [[anarchism|anarchist]] organisations to [[liberal democracy|liberal democrats]] and [[Catalan nationalism|Catalan]] or [[Basque nationalism|Basque]] separatists. The ''[[Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo]]'' (CNT) and the ''[[Uni\u00f3n General de Trabajadores]]'' (UGT) trade unions were outlawed and replaced in 1940 by the corporatist ''[[Spanish Labour Organization|Sindicato Vertical]]''. The [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] (PSOE) and the ''[[Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya]]'' (ERC) party were banned in 1939 while the [[Communist Party of Spain (main)|Communist Party of Spain]] (PCE) went underground. University students seeking democracy revolted in the late 1960s and early 1970s, which was repressed by the ''grises''. The [[Basque Nationalist Party]] (PNV) went into exile and in 1959 the armed separatist group [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] was created to wage a [[low-intensity warfare|low-intensity war]] against Franco. Like others at the time, Franco evinced a concern about a possible [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] and [[List of conspiracy theories|Judaic conspiracy]] against his regime.\n\nFranco continued to personally sign all death warrants until [[Last use of capital punishment in Spain|just months before he died]] despite international campaigns requesting him to desist.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\n===Spanish nationalism===\n[[File:Francoist demonstration in Salamanca.jpg|thumb|Francoist demonstration in [[Salamanca]] in 1937]]\nFranco's Spanish nationalism promoted a unitary national identity by repressing Spain's cultural diversity. [[Bullfighting]] and [[flamenco]]<ref>Roman, Mar. \"Spain frets over future of flamenco.\" 27 October 2007. Associated Press. [https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20071027/ap_en_mu/flamenco_for_foreigners]</ref> were promoted as national traditions, while those traditions not considered Spanish were suppressed. Franco's view of Spanish tradition was somewhat artificial and arbitrary: while some regional traditions were suppressed, Flamenco, an [[Andalusia]]n tradition, was considered part of a larger, national identity. All cultural activities were subject to [[censorship]] and many were forbidden entirely, often in an erratic manner. This cultural policy relaxed over time, most notably in the late 1960s and early 1970s.\n\nFranco was reluctant to enact any form of administrative and legislative decentralisation and kept a fully centralised form of government with a similar administrative structure to that established by the [[House of Bourbon]] and General [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]]. These structures were modelled after the centralised French state. As a result of this type of governance, government attention and initiatives were irregular and often depended more on the goodwill of government representatives than on regional needs. Thus inequalities in schooling, health care or transport facilities among regions were patent: historically affluent regions like [[Madrid]], [[Catalonia]] or the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] fared much better than others such as [[Extremadura]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] or [[Andalusia]].\n\nFranco eliminated the autonomy granted by the [[Second Spanish Republic]] to the regions and abolished the centuries-old fiscal privileges and autonomy (the [[fueros]]) in two of the three Basque provinces: [[Gipuzkoa|Guipuzcoa]] and [[Biscay]], which were officially classified as \"traitor regions\". The fueros were kept in the third Basque province, [[Alava]], and also in [[Navarre]], a former kingdom during the Middle Ages and the cradle of the Carlists, possibly due to the region's support during the Civil War.\n\nFranco also used [[Language politics in Spain under Franco|language politics]] in an attempt to establish national homogeneity. Despite Franco himself being Galician, the government revoked the official statute and recognition for the [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Galician language|Galician]] and [[Catalan language|Catalan]] languages that the Republic had granted them for the first time in the history of Spain. The former policy of promoting [[Spanish language|Spanish]] as the only official language of the state and education was resumed, even though millions of the country's citizens spoke other languages. The legal usage of languages other than Spanish was forbidden: all government, notarial, legal and commercial documents were to be drawn up exclusively in Spanish and any written in other languages were deemed null and void. The use of any other language was forbidden in schools, advertising, religious ceremonies and on road and shop signs. Publications in other languages were generally forbidden, though citizens continued to use them privately. During the late 1960s, these policies became more lenient yet non-Castilian languages continued to be discouraged and did not receive official status or legal recognition. Additionally, the popularisation of the compulsory national educational system and the development of modern mass media, both controlled by the state and exclusively in Spanish, reduced the competency of speakers of Basque, Catalan and Galician.\n\n===Roman Catholicism===\nAlthough Franco himself was previously known for not being very devout,<ref>Vi\u00f1as, \u00c1. (2012). En el combate por la historia: la Rep\u00fablica, la guerra civil, el franquismo.</ref> his regime often used religion as a means to increase its popularity throughout the Catholic world, especially after the Second World War. Franco himself was increasingly portrayed as a fervent Catholic and a staunch defender of Roman Catholicism, the declared state religion. The regime favoured very conservative Roman Catholicism and it reversed the secularisation process that had taken place under the Republic. According to historian [[Juli\u00e1n Casanova Ruiz|Julian Casanova]], \"the symbiosis of religion, fatherland and Caudillo\" saw the Church assume great political responsibilities, \"a hegemony and monopoly beyond its wildest dreams\" and it played \"a central role in policing the country's citizens\".<ref>Julian Casanova, Professor of Contemporary History at the University of Zaragoza, ''The Faces of Terror'', in Unearthing Franco's Legacy, p.108</ref>\n\n[[File:Francisco Franco en la iglesia de Santa Mar\u00eda durante la celebraci\u00f3n de la Salve (5 de 9) - Fondo Car-Kutxa Fototeka.jpg|thumb|Franco with Catholic Church dignitaries in 1946]]\nThe [[Law of Political Responsibility]] of February 1939 turned the Church into an extralegal body of investigation as parishes were granted policing powers equal to those of local government officials and leaders of the Falange. Some official jobs required a \"good behaviour\" statement by a priest. According to historian Julian Casanova, \"the reports that have survived reveal a clergy that was bitter because of the violent anti-clericalism and the unacceptable level of secularisation that Spanish society had reached during the republican years\" and the law of 1939 made the priests investigators of peoples' ideological and political pasts.<ref>Unearthing Franco's Legacy, p. 108/1115</ref>\n\nThe authorities encouraged denunciations in the workplace. For example, Barcelona's city hall obliged all government functionaries to \"tell the proper authorities who the leftists are in your department and everything you know about their activities\". A law passed in 1939 institutionalised the purging of public offices.<ref>Unearthing Franco's Legacy, p.103</ref> The poet [[Carlos Barral]] recorded that in his family \"any allusion to republican relatives was scrupulously avoided; everyone took part in the enthusiasm for the new era and wrapped themselves in the folds of religiosity\". Only through silence could people associated with the Republic be relatively safe from imprisonment or unemployment. After the death of Franco, the price of the peaceful transition to democracy would be silence and \"the tacit agreement to forget the past\",<ref>Unearthing Franco's Legacy p. 128\u2013129, Michael Richards ''Grand Narratives, Collective Memory, and Social History''.</ref> which was given legal status by the 1977 [[Pact of forgetting]].\n\n[[Civil marriage]]s that had taken place in the Republic were declared null and void unless they had been validated by the Church, along with divorces.

He held the post for 12 years, during which he finished the task of purging the ministry begun by the Commission of Culture and Teaching headed by [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Pem\u00e1n]].

He had no particular desire for a king because of his strained relations with the legitimist heir to the Crown, Juan of Bourbon. Therefore, he left the throne vacant with himself as regent and set the basis for his succession. This gesture was largely done to appease monarchist factions within the Movement. At the same time, Franco wore the uniform of a captain general (a rank traditionally reserved for the King), resided in the [[Royal Palace of El Pardo]], appropriated the kingly privilege of walking beneath a [[Baldachin|canopy]] and his portrait appeared on most Spanish coins. Indeed, although his formal titles were ''Jefe del Estado'' (Head of State) and ''[[Generalissimo|General\u00edsimo de los Ej\u00e9rcitos Espa\u00f1oles]]'' (Generalissimo of the Spanish Armies), he was referred to as [[Caudillo|Caudillo of Spain]], [[by the Grace of God]]. ''Por la Gracia de Dios'' is a technical, legal formulation which states sovereign dignity in [[absolute monarchy|absolute monarchies]] and had been used only by monarchs before.\n\nThe long-delayed selection of Juan Carlos of Bourbon as Franco's official successor in 1969 was an unpleasant surprise for many interested parties as Juan Carlos was the rightful heir for neither the Carlists nor the Legitimists.{{Citation needed|reason=21-9-2009|date=September 2009}}\n\n==Narrative of the Civil War==\n{{See also|Spanish Civil War}}\nFor nearly twenty years after the war, Francoist Spain presented the conflict as a crusade against Bolshevism in defense of Christian civilization. In Francoist narrative, authoritarianism had defeated anarchy and overseen the elimination of \"agitators\", those \"without God\" and the \"[[Judeo-Masonic conspiracy theory|Judeo-Masonic conspiracy]]\". Since Franco had relied on thousands of North African soldiers, anti-Islamic sentiment \"was played down but the centuries old myth of the Moorish threat lay at the base of the construction of the \"communist menace\" as a modern-day Eastern plague\".<ref>Michael Richards, <nowiki>''Unearthing Franco's Legacy''</nowiki>, p. 129.</ref> The official position was therefore that the wartime Republic was simply a proto-Stalinist monolith, its leaders intent on creating a Spanish Soviet satellite. The anti-communist crusade narrative still exists both as \"a minority academic history\" and in media friendly, politically oriented productions ([[Stanley Payne]]/[[Pio Moa]]). This discourse obscured the social roots of the war and analysis of its origins. Many Spanish children grew up believing the war was fought against foreigners and the painter [[Julian Grau Santos]] has said \"it was instilled in me and I always believed that Spain had won the war against foreign enemies of our historic greatness\".{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} About {{formatnum:6832}} Catholic clergy were murdered by the Republicans.<ref>Julio de la Cueva, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/261121 \"Religious Persecution, Anticlerical Tradition and Revolution: On Atrocities against the Clergy during the Spanish Civil War\"] ''Journal of Contemporary History'' 33.3 (July 1998): 355.</ref> Collectively, they are known as the [[martyrs of the Spanish Civil War]].<ref name=\"Butler's Lives of the Saints\">Butler, Alban and Peter Doyle [https://books.google.com/books?id=PBGzh1JK2gUC&pg=PA169 Butler's Lives of the Saints] p. 169 Liturgical Press (February 2000).</ref>\n\n==Media==\nUnder the 1938 Press Law, all newspapers were put under [[Censorship|prior censorship]] and were forced to include any articles the government desired. Chief editors were nominated by the government and all journalists were required to be registered. All liberal, republican and left-wing media were prohibited.\n\nThe ''Delegaci\u00f3n Nacional de Prensa y Propaganda'' was established as a network of government media, including daily newspapers ''[[Arriba (newspaper)|Diario Arriba]]'' and ''Pueblo''. The ''[[EFE]]'' and Pyresa government news agencies were created in 1939 and 1945. The ''[[Radio Nacional de Espa\u00f1a]]'' state radio had the exclusive right to transmit news bulletins, which all broadcasters were required to air. The [[No-Do]] were 10-minute newsreels shown at all cinemas. The ''[[Televisi\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola]]'', the government television network, debuted in 1956.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church had its own media outlets, including the Ya newspaper and the ''[[Cadena COPE]]'' radio network. Other pro-government media included ''[[Cadena SER]]'', ''[[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]]'', ''[[La Vanguardia|La Vanguardia Espa\u00f1ola]]'', ''[[El Correo]]'' and ''[[El Diario Vasco]]''.\n\nNotable independent media outlets included humor magazine ''La Codorniz''.\n\nThe 1966 Press Law dropped the prior censorship regime and allowed media outlets to select their own directors, although criticism was still a crime.\n\n==Economic policy==\n{{See also|Economic history of Spain#The Franco Era, 1939\u201375}}\nThe Civil War had ravaged the Spanish economy. Infrastructure had been damaged, workers killed and daily business severely hampered. For more than a decade after Franco's victory, the economy improved little. Franco initially pursued a policy of [[autarky]], cutting off almost all international trade.  The policy had devastating effects and the economy stagnated. Only black marketeers could enjoy an evident affluence.<ref>{{cite book|last=S\u00e1nchez|first=Antonio Cazorla|title=Fear and Progress: Ordinary Lives in Franco's Spain, 1939\u20131975|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nGeHYYnODJ4C&pg=PA58&lpg=PA58#v=onepage&q&f=false|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|accessdate=23 April 2013|pages=58\u201360|date=July 2010|isbn=9781444306507}}</ref>\n\nIn 1940, the ''[[Spanish Labour Organization|Sindicato Vertical]]'' was created. It was inspired by the ideas of Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera, who thought that [[class struggle]] would be ended by grouping together workers and owners according to [[Corporate statism|corporative]] principles. It was the only legal trade union and was under government control. Other trade unions were forbidden and strongly repressed along with political parties outside the Falange.\n\nOn the brink of bankruptcy, a combination of pressure from the United States, the IMF and technocrats from Opus Dei managed to \"convince\" the regime to adopt a free market economy in 1959 in what amounted to a mini coup d'\u00e9tat which removed the old guard in charge of the economy, despite the opposition of Franco. However, this economic liberalisation was not accompanied by political reforms and oppression continued unabated.\n\nEconomic growth picked up after 1959 after Franco took authority away from these ideologues and gave more power to the [[Economic liberalism|liberal]] technocrats. The country implemented several development policies and growth took off creating the \"[[Spanish Miracle]]\". Concurrent with the absence of social reforms and the economic power shift, a tide of mass emigration commenced to European countries and to lesser extent to South America. Emigration helped the regime in two ways: the country got rid of surplus population and the emigrants supplied the country with much needed monetary remittances.\n\nDuring the 1960s, Spain experienced further increases in wealth. International firms established their factories in Spain: salaries were low, taxes nearly nonexistent, strikes were forbidden, labour health or real state regulations were unheard of and Spain was virtually a virgin market. Spain became the second fastest-growing economy in the world, just behind [[Japan]]. The rapid development of this period became known as the \"Spanish Miracle\". At the time of Franco's death, Spain still lagged behind most of Western Europe, but the gap between its GDP per capita and that of the major Western European economies had greatly narrowed. In world terms, Spain was already enjoying a fairly high material standard of living with basic but comprehensive services. However, the period between the mid-1970s and mid-1980s was to prove difficult as in addition to the [[1970s energy crisis|oil shocks]] to which Spain was highly exposed, the settling of the new political order took priority over the modernising of the economy.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\n==Legacy==\n{{Further|Pact of forgetting}}\n[[File:SPA-2014-San Lorenzo de El Escorial-Valley of the Fallen (Valle de los Ca\u00eddos).jpg|thumb|By decision of [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|King Juan Carlos I]], Franco was entombed in the monument of [[Valle de los Ca\u00eddos]], until his body was moved in October 2019.<ref name=\"bbc._Spai\">{{Cite web |title=Spain relocates dictator Franco's remains |author= |work=BBC News |date= |access-date=4 November 2019 |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-50164806}}</ref>]]\n[[File:Francoayto.jpg|thumb|Equestrian statue of [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] in the ''[[List of equestrian statues in Spain|Plaza del Ayuntamiento]]'' of [[Santander, Spain|Santander]], taken down in late 2008]]\nIn Spain and abroad, the legacy of Franco remains controversial.

The new arms were allegedly inspired in the coat of arms the [[Catholic Monarchs]] adopted after the taking of [[Emirate of Granada]] from the Moors, but replacing the arms of [[Sicily]] with those of Navarre and adding the [[Pillars of Hercules]] on either side of the coat of arms. In 1938, the columns were placed outside the wings. On 26 July 1945, the commander's ensigns were suppressed by decree and on 11 October a detailed regulation of flags was published that fixed the model of the bi-colour flag in use, but better defined its details, emphasising a greater{{clarify|date=September 2011}} style of the Saint John's eagle. The models established by this decree remained in force until 1977.\n\nDuring this period, two more flags were usually displayed along with the national flag: the flag of Falange (red, black and red vertical stripes, with the [[Yoke and arrows|yokes and arrows]] in the centre of the black stripe) and the traditionalist flag (white background with the [[Cross of Burgundy Flag|Cross of Burgundy]] in the middle), representing the National Movement which had unified Falange and the [[Requet\u00e9s]] under the name ''Falange Espa\u00f1ola Tradicionalista y de las JONS''.\n\nFrom the death of Franco in 1975 until 1977, the national flag followed the 1945 regulations. On 21 January 1977, a new regulation was approved that stipulated an eagle with more open wings, with the restored Pillars of Hercules placed within the wings and the tape with the motto ''\"[[Una, Grande y Libre]]\"'' (\"One, Great and Free\") moved over the eagle's head from its previous position around the neck.\n\n<center>\n<gallery caption=\"State flags\">\nFile:Bandera del bando nacional 1936-1938.svg|[[Flag of Spain#Spanish State|State flag]] (1936&ndash;1938)\nFile:Flag of Spain (1938 - 1945).svg|[[Flag of Spain#Spanish State|State flag]] (1938&ndash;1945)\nFile:Flag of Spain (1945 - 1977).svg|[[Flag of Spain#Spanish State|State flag]] (1945&ndash;1977)\nFile:Flag of Spain (Civil) alternate colours.svg|[[Flag of Spain|Civil flag]] (1936&ndash;1975)\n</gallery>\n<gallery caption=\"Party flags\">\nFile:Bandera FE JONS.svg|Flag of the [[FET y de las JONS|Falange Movement]]\nFile:Flag of Traditionalist Requetes.svg|Flag of the [[Carlism|Traditionalist Movement (Carlism)]]\n</gallery>\n</center>\n\n===Standards===\n{{See also|Royal Bend of Castile|Royal Standard of Spain}}\nFrom 1940 to 1975, Franco used the [[Royal Bend of Castile]] as Head of State's [[Military colours, standards and guidons|standard and guidon]]: the Bend between the Pillars of Hercules, crowned with an imperial crown and open royal crown.\n\nAs [[Prince of Spain]] from 1969 to 1975, Juan Carlos used a royal standard which was virtually identical to the one later adopted when he became King in 1975. The earlier standard differed only that it featured the royal crown of a Crown Prince, the King's royal crown has 8 arches of which 5 are visible, while the Prince's one has only 4 arches of which 3 are visible.

Aside from a few high-rise hotels and office towers, most high-rise buildings (usually 10 stories and up) are \"condos\" scattered across prosperous neighbourhoods north of downtown such as [[Bahan Township|Bahan]], [[Dagon Township|Dagon]], [[Kamayut Township|Kamayut]] and [[Mayangon Township|Mayangon]].\n\nOlder satellite towns such as [[Thaketa Township|Thaketa]], [[North Okkalapa Township|North Okkalapa]] and [[South Okkalapa Township|South Okkalapa]] are lined mostly with one to two-story detached houses with access to the city's electricity grid.

This order is repeated from west to east.

A UN estimate<ref name=un/> puts the population as 4.35&nbsp;million in 2010 but a 2009 US State Department estimate<ref name=usdos>{{cite web | url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/35910.htm | title=Background note: Burma | accessdate=6 March 2010 | publisher=US Department of State | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170122194342/https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/35910.htm | archive-date=22 January 2017 | url-status=dead }}</ref> puts it at 5.5&nbsp;million. The US State Department's estimate is probably closer to the real number since the UN number is a straight-line projection, and does not appear to take the expansion of city limits in the past two decades into account. The city's population grew sharply after 1948 as many people (mainly, the indigenous Burmese) from other parts of the country moved into the newly built satellite towns of North Okkalapa, South Okkalapa, and Thaketa in the 1950s and East Dagon, North Dagon and South Dagon in the 1990s. Immigrants have founded their regional associations (such as Mandalay Association, Mawlamyaing Association, etc.) in Yangon for networking purposes. The government's decision to move the nation's administrative capital to Naypyidaw has drained an unknown number of civil servants away from Yangon.\n\nYangon is the most ethnically diverse city in the country. While [[Burmese Indians|Indians]] formed the slight majority prior to World War II,<ref name=tmmt/> today, the majority of the population is of indigenous [[Bamar]] (Burman) descent. Large communities of Indians/South Asian Burmese and the [[Chinese people in Burma|Chinese Burmese]] exist especially in the traditional downtown neighbourhoods. A large number of [[Rakhine people|Rakhine]] and [[Karen people|Karen]] also live in the city.\n\n[[Burmese language|Burmese]] is the principal language of the city. English is by far the preferred second language of the educated class. In recent years, however, the prospect of overseas job opportunities has enticed some to study other languages: [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]] is most popular, followed by Japanese, and French.<ref name=lang>{{Cite news| title=Language training centres open doors to new worlds| url=http://www.mmtimes.com/feature/edu/edu002.htm| date=14 May 2007| author1=Kyaw Soe Linn| author2=Phyo Wai Kyaw| lastauthoramp=yes| work=The Myanmar Times| access-date=1 January 2009| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720094651/http://www.mmtimes.com/feature/edu/edu002.htm| archive-date=20 July 2008| url-status=dead| df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Religions===\nThe primary religions practised in Yangon are [[Buddhism]], Christianity, [[Hinduism]], and [[Islam]]. Shwedagon Pagoda is a famous religious landmark in the city.\n\n===Media===\n\nYangon is the country's hub for the movie, music, advertising, newspaper and book publishing industries. All media is heavily regulated by the military government. Television broadcasting is off limits to the private sector. All media content must first be approved by the government's media censor board, [[Press Scrutiny and Registration Division]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite magazine| url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=10648| title=Burma: The Censored Land| date=1 March 2008| author=Yeni| magazine=The Irrawaddy| access-date=20 March 2008| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311223612/http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=10648| archive-date=11 March 2008| url-status=dead| df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nMost television channels in the country are broadcast from Yangon. [[TV Myanmar]] and [[Myawaddy TV]] are the two main channels, providing Burmese-language news and entertainment programmes. Other special interest channels are MWD-1 and MWD-2, [[MRTV-3]], the English-language channel that targets overseas audiences via satellite and via Internet, [[MRTV-4]] and Channel 7 (Yangon) are with a focus on non-formal education programs and movies, and Movie 5, a pay-TV channel specialising in broadcasting foreign movies.<ref>{{Cite news| title=Digital television take-up slower than expected| url=http://www.mmtimes.com/no429/b004.htm| date=3 August 2008| author=Kyaw Hsu Mon| work=The Myanmar Times| access-date=8 August 2008| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430045926/http://www.mmtimes.com/no429/b004.htm| archive-date=30 April 2011| url-status=dead| df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nYangon has three radio stations. [[Myanmar Radio National Service]] is the national radio service and broadcasts mostly in Burmese (and in English during specific times.) Pop culture oriented [[Yangon City FM]] and [[Mandalay City FM]] radio stations specialise in Burmese and English pop music, entertainment programs, live celebrity interviews, etc. New radio channels such as Shwe FM and Pyinsawaddy FM can also be tuned with the city area.\n\nNearly all print media and industries are based out of Yangon. All three national newspapers \u2013 two Burmese language dailies ''[[The New Light of Myanmar|Myanma Alin]]'' ({{my|\u1019\u103c\u1014\u103a\u1019\u102c\u1037\u1021\u101c\u1004\u103a\u1038}}) and ''[[Kyemon]]'' ({{my|\u1000\u103c\u1031\u1038\u1019\u102f\u1036}}), and the English language ''[[The New Light of Myanmar]]'' \u2013 are published by the government. Semi-governmental ''[[The Myanmar Times]]'' weekly, published in Burmese and in English, is mainly geared for Yangon's expatriate community. Over twenty special interest journals and magazines covering sports, fashion, finance, crime, literature (but never politics) vie for the readership of the general populace.\n\nAccess to foreign media is extremely difficult. Satellite television in Yangon, and in Burma, is very expensive as the government imposes an annual registration fee of one million [[burmese_kyat|kyats]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> Certain foreign newspapers and periodicals such as the ''[[Straits Times]]'' can be found only in a few (mostly downtown) bookstores. Internet access in Yangon, which has the best telecommunication infrastructure in the country, is slow and erratic at best, and the Burmese government implements one of the world's most restrictive regimes of Internet control.<ref name=\"oni\">{{cite web| url=http://opennet.net/studies/burma| title=Internet Filtering in Burma in 2005: A Country Study| date=1 October 2005| accessdate=29 August 2008}}</ref> International text messaging and voice messaging was permitted only in August 2008.<ref name=\"sms\">{{cite magazine| url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=13962| title=International Text Messaging Approved in Burma| author=Min Lwin| date=21 August 2008| magazine=The Irrawaddy| access-date=30 August 2008| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811233000/http://irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=13962| archive-date=11 August 2010| url-status=dead| df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Communication===\nCommon facilities taken for granted elsewhere are luxury prized items in Yangon and Burma.

Watching European football (mostly English [[Premier League]] with occasional [[La Liga]], [[Serie A]], [[Bundesliga]]) matches while sipping tea is a popular pastime among many Yangonites. The average person stays close to his or her residential neighbourhood. The well-to-do tend to visit shopping malls and parks on weekends. Some leave the city on weekends for [[Chaungtha, Pathein|Chaungtha]] and [[Ngwesaung]] beach resorts in [[Ayeyarwady Division]].\n\n[[File:Hindu temple procession cart, Yangon.jpg|left|thumb|[[Hinduism in Southeast Asia|Hindu]] temple procession cart]]\nYangon is also home to many [[pagoda festival]]s (''paya pwe''), held during dry-season months (November \u2013 March). The most famous of all, the Shwedagon Pagoda Festival in March, attracts thousands of pilgrims from around the country.\n\n[[List of museums in Yangon|Yangon's museums]] are the domain of tourists and rarely visited by the locals.\n\nMost of Yangon's larger hotels offer some kind of nightlife entertainment, geared towards tourists and the well-to-do Burmese. Some hotels offer traditional Burmese performing arts shows complete with a traditional Burmese orchestra. The pub scene in larger hotels is more or less the same as elsewhere in Asia. Other options include karaoke bars and pub restaurants in Yangon [[Chinatown]].\n\nDue to the problems of high inflation, the lack of high denomination notes, and the fact that many of the population do not have access to checks, or credit or debit cards, it is common to see citizens carrying a considerable amount of cash.<ref>{{Cite journal| title=Myanmar new 10,000-kyat note confirmed|author1=Claudio Marana  |author2=Nin Cheun  |lastauthoramp=yes | date=17 June 2012 | journal= Bank Note News | url=http://www.banknotenews.com/files/0cb53d71db0460b4c129de9c869f72a8-2132.php}}</ref> (The highest denomination of Burmese currency [[Myanma kyat|kyat]] is 10 000 (~US$10.)) Credit cards are only rarely used in the city, chiefly in the more lavish hotels. Credit cards are also accepted in the major supermarket and convenience store chains.\n\n===Sports===\nAs the city has the best sporting facilities in the country, most national-level annual sporting tournaments such as track and field, football, volleyball, tennis and swimming are held in Yangon. The 40,000-seat [[Aung San Stadium]] and the 32,000-seat [[Thuwunna Stadium]] are the main venues for the highly popular annual State and Division football tournament. Until April 2009, the now defunct [[Myanmar Premier League]], consisted of 16 Yangon-based clubs,<ref>{{Cite news| title=Myanmar edges towards pro football| url=http://www.myanmar.com/myanmartimes/MyanmarTimes14-277/sport.htm| date=1 August 2005| work=The Myanmar Times| author=Zaw Htet| access-date=27 November 2018| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514035649/http://www.myanmar.com/myanmartimes/MyanmarTimes14-277/sport.htm| archive-date=14 May 2011| url-status=dead| df=dmy-all}}</ref> played all its matches in Yangon stadiums, and attracted little interest from the general public or commercial success despite the enormous popularity of football in Burma. Most Yangonites prefer watching European football on satellite TV. Teams such as Manchester United, Liverpool, Chelsea, Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Manchester City are among the favourite European teams among the Yangonites. It remains to be seen whether the [[Myanmar National League]], the country's first professional football league, and its Yangon-based club [[Yangon United FC]] will attract a sufficient following in the country's most important media market.\n\nYangon is also home to annual the Myanmar Open golf tournament, and the Myanmar Open tennis tournament. The city hosted the 1961 and 1969 [[South East Asian Games]]. During colonial times, [[cricket]] was played mostly by British officials in the city. [[First-class cricket]] was played in the city in January 1927 when the touring [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] played [[Burma national cricket team|Burma]] and the [[Rangoon Gymkhana cricket team|Rangoon Gymkhana]]. Two grounds were used to host these matches, the [[BAA Ground]] and the [[Gymkhana Ground, Rangoon|Gymkhana Ground]].<ref>{{citation |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/44/250.html |title=BAA Ground |publisher=CricketArchive.com}} Retrieved on 8 October 2011</ref><ref>{{citation |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/44/251.html |title=Gymkhana Ground |publisher=CricketArchive.com}} Retrieved on 8 October 2011</ref> These matches mark the only time Burma and Rangoon Gymkhana have appeared in first-class cricket, and the only time first-class cricket has been played in Burma.

setting between the [[Bago River|Bago]], Yangon and [[Hlaing River]]s. People moved in, but little of the city moved out. Maps from 1944 show little development north of [[Inya Lake]] and areas that are now layered in cement and stacked with houses were then virtual backwaters. Since the late 1980s, however, the city began a rapid spread north to where [[Yangon International Airport]] now stands.

Although most apartment buildings were built only within the last 20 years, they look much older and rundown due to shoddy construction and lack of proper maintenance.\n\nUnlike other major Asian cities, Yangon does not have any skyscrapers. Aside from a few high-rise hotels and office towers, most high-rise buildings (usually 10 stories and up) are \"condos\" scattered across prosperous neighbourhoods north of downtown such as [[Bahan Township|Bahan]], [[Dagon Township|Dagon]], [[Kamayut Township|Kamayut]] and [[Mayangon Township|Mayangon]].\n\nOlder satellite towns such as [[Thaketa Township|Thaketa]], [[North Okkalapa Township|North Okkalapa]] and [[South Okkalapa Township|South Okkalapa]] are lined mostly with one to two-story detached houses with access to the city's electricity grid. Newer satellite towns such as [[North Dagon Township|North Dagon]] and [[South Dagon Township|South Dagon]] are in a grid layout. The satellite towns\u2014old or new\u2014receive little or no municipal services.\n\n===Road layout===\n[[File:Ministers' Office Building Yangon 4.jpg|thumb|Yangon Secretariat Office]]\n[[Downtown Yangon]]'s road layout follows a grid pattern, based on four types of roads:\n* Broad 49-m wide roads running west to east\n* Broad 30-m wide roads running south to north\n* Two narrow 9.1-m wide streets running south to north\n* Mid-size 15-m wide streets running south to north\n\nThe east\u2013west grid of central was laid out by British military engineers Fraser and Montgomerie after the [[Second Anglo-Burmese War]].<ref name=\"arc\"/> The city was later developed by the Public Works Department and Bengal Corps of Engineers. The pattern of south to north roads is as follows: one broad {{convert|100|ft|m|sing=on}} wide broad road, two narrow streets, one mid-size street, two more narrow streets, and then another {{convert|100|ft|m|sing=on}} wide broad road. This order is repeated from west to east. The narrow streets are numbered; the medium and broad roads are named.\n\nFor example, the {{convert|100|ft|m|sing=on}} Lanmadaw Road is followed by {{convert|30|ft|m|sing=on}}-wide 17th and 18th streets then the medium {{convert|50|ft|m|sing=on}} Sint-Oh-Dan Road, the 30-foot 19th and 20th streets, followed by another {{convert|100|ft|m|sing=on}} wide Latha Road, followed again by the two numbered small roads 21st and 22nd streets, and so on.\n\nThe roads running parallel west to east were the Strand Road, Merchant Road, Maha Bandula (n\u00e9e Dalhousie) Road, Anawrahta (Fraser) Road, and Bogyoke Aung San (Montgomerie) Road.\n[[File:Yangon Kandawgyi Lake.jpeg|link=link=Special:FilePath/Kandawgyi_Lake_at_Yangon.jpg|alt=|thumb|[[Kandawgyi Lake]], a popular park near downtown Yangon]]\n\n===Parks and gardens===\nThe largest and best maintained parks in Yangon are located around [[Shwedagon Pagoda]].

All population figures are estimates since no official census has been conducted in Burma since 1983. A UN estimate<ref name=un/> puts the population as 4.35&nbsp;million in 2010 but a 2009 US State Department estimate<ref name=usdos>{{cite web | url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/35910.htm | title=Background note: Burma | accessdate=6 March 2010 | publisher=US Department of State | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170122194342/https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/35910.htm | archive-date=22 January 2017 | url-status=dead }}</ref> puts it at 5.5&nbsp;million. The US State Department's estimate is probably closer to the real number since the UN number is a straight-line projection, and does not appear to take the expansion of city limits in the past two decades into account. The city's population grew sharply after 1948 as many people (mainly, the indigenous Burmese) from other parts of the country moved into the newly built satellite towns of North Okkalapa, South Okkalapa, and Thaketa in the 1950s and East Dagon, North Dagon and South Dagon in the 1990s. Immigrants have founded their regional associations (such as Mandalay Association, Mawlamyaing Association, etc.) in Yangon for networking purposes. The government's decision to move the nation's administrative capital to Naypyidaw has drained an unknown number of civil servants away from Yangon.\n\nYangon is the most ethnically diverse city in the country. While [[Burmese Indians|Indians]] formed the slight majority prior to World War II,<ref name=tmmt/> today, the majority of the population is of indigenous [[Bamar]] (Burman) descent. Large communities of Indians/South Asian Burmese and the [[Chinese people in Burma|Chinese Burmese]] exist especially in the traditional downtown neighbourhoods. A large number of [[Rakhine people|Rakhine]] and [[Karen people|Karen]] also live in the city.\n\n[[Burmese language|Burmese]] is the principal language of the city. English is by far the preferred second language of the educated class. In recent years, however, the prospect of overseas job opportunities has enticed some to study other languages: [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]] is most popular, followed by Japanese, and French.<ref name=lang>{{Cite news| title=Language training centres open doors to new worlds| url=http://www.mmtimes.com/feature/edu/edu002.htm| date=14 May 2007| author1=Kyaw Soe Linn| author2=Phyo Wai Kyaw| lastauthoramp=yes| work=The Myanmar Times| access-date=1 January 2009| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720094651/http://www.mmtimes.com/feature/edu/edu002.htm| archive-date=20 July 2008| url-status=dead| df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Religions===\nThe primary religions practised in Yangon are [[Buddhism]], Christianity, [[Hinduism]], and [[Islam]]. Shwedagon Pagoda is a famous religious landmark in the city.\n\n===Media===\n\nYangon is the country's hub for the movie, music, advertising, newspaper and book publishing industries. All media is heavily regulated by the military government. Television broadcasting is off limits to the private sector. All media content must first be approved by the government's media censor board, [[Press Scrutiny and Registration Division]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite magazine| url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=10648| title=Burma: The Censored Land| date=1 March 2008| author=Yeni| magazine=The Irrawaddy| access-date=20 March 2008| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311223612/http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=10648| archive-date=11 March 2008| url-status=dead| df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nMost television channels in the country are broadcast from Yangon.

[[Myanmar Radio National Service]] is the national radio service and broadcasts mostly in Burmese (and in English during specific times.) Pop culture oriented [[Yangon City FM]] and [[Mandalay City FM]] radio stations specialise in Burmese and English pop music, entertainment programs, live celebrity interviews, etc. New radio channels such as Shwe FM and Pyinsawaddy FM can also be tuned with the city area.\n\nNearly all print media and industries are based out of Yangon. All three national newspapers \u2013 two Burmese language dailies ''[[The New Light of Myanmar|Myanma Alin]]'' ({{my|\u1019\u103c\u1014\u103a\u1019\u102c\u1037\u1021\u101c\u1004\u103a\u1038}}) and ''[[Kyemon]]'' ({{my|\u1000\u103c\u1031\u1038\u1019\u102f\u1036}}), and the English language ''[[The New Light of Myanmar]]'' \u2013 are published by the government. Semi-governmental ''[[The Myanmar Times]]'' weekly, published in Burmese and in English, is mainly geared for Yangon's expatriate community. Over twenty special interest journals and magazines covering sports, fashion, finance, crime, literature (but never politics) vie for the readership of the general populace.\n\nAccess to foreign media is extremely difficult. Satellite television in Yangon, and in Burma, is very expensive as the government imposes an annual registration fee of one million [[burmese_kyat|kyats]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> Certain foreign newspapers and periodicals such as the ''[[Straits Times]]'' can be found only in a few (mostly downtown) bookstores. Internet access in Yangon, which has the best telecommunication infrastructure in the country, is slow and erratic at best, and the Burmese government implements one of the world's most restrictive regimes of Internet control.<ref name=\"oni\">{{cite web| url=http://opennet.net/studies/burma| title=Internet Filtering in Burma in 2005: A Country Study| date=1 October 2005| accessdate=29 August 2008}}</ref> International text messaging and voice messaging was permitted only in August 2008.<ref name=\"sms\">{{cite magazine| url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=13962| title=International Text Messaging Approved in Burma| author=Min Lwin| date=21 August 2008| magazine=The Irrawaddy| access-date=30 August 2008| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811233000/http://irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=13962| archive-date=11 August 2010| url-status=dead| df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Communication===\nCommon facilities taken for granted elsewhere are luxury prized items in Yangon and Burma.

The average person stays close to his or her residential neighbourhood. The well-to-do tend to visit shopping malls and parks on weekends. Some leave the city on weekends for [[Chaungtha, Pathein|Chaungtha]] and [[Ngwesaung]] beach resorts in [[Ayeyarwady Division]].\n\n[[File:Hindu temple procession cart, Yangon.jpg|left|thumb|[[Hinduism in Southeast Asia|Hindu]] temple procession cart]]\nYangon is also home to many [[pagoda festival]]s (''paya pwe''), held during dry-season months (November \u2013 March). The most famous of all, the Shwedagon Pagoda Festival in March, attracts thousands of pilgrims from around the country.\n\n[[List of museums in Yangon|Yangon's museums]] are the domain of tourists and rarely visited by the locals.\n\nMost of Yangon's larger hotels offer some kind of nightlife entertainment, geared towards tourists and the well-to-do Burmese. Some hotels offer traditional Burmese performing arts shows complete with a traditional Burmese orchestra. The pub scene in larger hotels is more or less the same as elsewhere in Asia. Other options include karaoke bars and pub restaurants in Yangon [[Chinatown]].\n\nDue to the problems of high inflation, the lack of high denomination notes, and the fact that many of the population do not have access to checks, or credit or debit cards, it is common to see citizens carrying a considerable amount of cash.<ref>{{Cite journal| title=Myanmar new 10,000-kyat note confirmed|author1=Claudio Marana  |author2=Nin Cheun  |lastauthoramp=yes | date=17 June 2012 | journal= Bank Note News | url=http://www.banknotenews.com/files/0cb53d71db0460b4c129de9c869f72a8-2132.php}}</ref> (The highest denomination of Burmese currency [[Myanma kyat|kyat]] is 10 000 (~US$10.))

Credit cards are also accepted in the major supermarket and convenience store chains.\n\n===Sports===\nAs the city has the best sporting facilities in the country, most national-level annual sporting tournaments such as track and field, football, volleyball, tennis and swimming are held in Yangon. The 40,000-seat [[Aung San Stadium]] and the 32,000-seat [[Thuwunna Stadium]] are the main venues for the highly popular annual State and Division football tournament.

It remains to be seen whether the [[Myanmar National League]], the country's first professional football league, and its Yangon-based club [[Yangon United FC]] will attract a sufficient following in the country's most important media market.\n\nYangon is also home to annual the Myanmar Open golf tournament, and the Myanmar Open tennis tournament. The city hosted the 1961 and 1969 [[South East Asian Games]]. During colonial times, [[cricket]] was played mostly by British officials in the city. [[First-class cricket]] was played in the city in January 1927 when the touring [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] played [[Burma national cricket team|Burma]] and the [[Rangoon Gymkhana cricket team|Rangoon Gymkhana]].

In his preface to his collection, Meleager describes his arrangement of poems as if it were a head-band or garland of flowers woven together in a tour de force that made the word \"Anthology\" a synonym for a collection of literary works for future generations.\n\nMeleager's ''Anthology'' was popular enough that it attracted later additions. Prefaces to the editions of [[Philippus of Thessalonica]] and [[Agathias]] were preserved in the ''Greek Anthology'' to attest to their additions of later poems. The definitive edition was made by [[Constantine Cephalas]] in the 10th century, who added a number of other collections: [[homoeroticism|homoerotic]] verse collected by [[Straton of Sardis]] in the 2nd century AD; a collection of [[Christianity|Christian]] epigrams found in churches; a collection of satirical and convivial epigrams collected by [[Diogenianus]]; [[Christodorus]]' description of statues in the Byzantine [[gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasium]] of [[Baths of Zeuxippos|Zeuxippos]]; and a collection of inscriptions from a temple in [[Cyzicus]].\n\nThe scholar [[Maximus Planudes]] also made an edition of the ''Greek Anthology'', which while adding some poems, primarily deleted or [[bowdlerized]] many of the poems he felt were too explicit. His anthology was the only one known to Western Europe (his autograph copy, dated 1301 survives; the first edition based on his collection was printed in 1494) until 1606 when [[Claudius Salmasius]] found in the library at [[Heidelberg]] a fuller collection based on Cephalas. The copy made by Salmasius was not, however, published until 1776, when [[Richard Fran\u00e7ois Philippe Brunck]] included it in his ''Analecta''. The first critical edition was that of F. Jacobs (13 vols. 1794\u20131803; revised 1813\u201317).\n\nSince its transmission to the rest of Europe, the ''Greek Anthology'' has left a deep impression on its readers. In a 1971 article on [[Robin Skelton]]'s translation of a selection of poems from the ''Anthology'', a reviewer for the ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'' wrote, \"The time of life does not exist when it is impossible to discover in it a masterly poem one had never seen before.\" Its influence can be seen on writers as diverse as [[Propertius]], [[Ezra Pound]] and [[Edgar Lee Masters]]. Since full and uncensored English translations became available at the end of the 20th century, its influence has widened still further.\n\n== Literary history ==\nThe art of [[occasional poetry]] had been cultivated in Greece from an early period\u2014less, however, as the vehicle of personal feeling than as the recognized commemoration of remarkable individuals or events, on sepulchral monuments and votive offerings: Such compositions were termed epigrams, ''i.e.'' inscriptions. The modern use of the word is a departure from the original sense, which simply indicated that the composition was intended to be engraved or inscribed.\n\nSuch a composition must necessarily be brief, and the restraints attendant upon its publication concurred with the simplicity of Greek taste in prescribing conciseness of expression, pregnancy of meaning, purity of diction and singleness of thought, as the indispensable conditions of excellence in the epigrammatic style. The term was soon extended to any piece by which these conditions were fulfilled.\n\nThe transition from the monumental to the purely literary character of the epigram was favoured by the exhaustion of more lofty forms of poetry, the general increase, from the general diffusion of culture, of accomplished writers and tasteful readers, but, above all, by the changed political circumstances of the times, which induced many who would otherwise have engaged in public affairs to addict themselves to literary pursuits. These causes came into full operation during the Alexandrian era, in which we find every description of epigrammatic composition perfectly developed.\n\nAbout 60&nbsp;BC, the [[sophist]] and poet [[Meleager of Gadara]] undertook to combine the choicest effusions of his predecessors into a single body of fugitive poetry. Collections of monumental inscriptions, or of poems on particular subjects, had previously been formed by [[Polemon of Athens|Polemon Periegetes]] and others; but Meleager first gave the principle a comprehensive application.\n\nHis selection, compiled from forty-six of his predecessors, and including numerous contributions of his own, was entitled ''The Garland'' ({{lang|grc|\u03a3\u03c4\u03ad\u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2}}); in an introductory poem each poet is compared to some flower, fancifully deemed appropriate to his genius. The arrangement of his collection was alphabetical, according to the initial letter of each epigram.\n\nIn the age of the emperor [[Tiberius]] (or [[Trajan]], according to others) the work of Meleager was continued by another epigrammatist, [[Philippus of Thessalonica]], who first employed the term anthology. His collection, which included the compositions of thirteen writers subsequent to Meleager, was also arranged alphabetically, and contained an introductory poem. It was of inferior quality to Meleager's.\n\nSomewhat later, under Hadrian, another supplement was formed by the sophist [[Diogenianus|Diogenianus of Heracleia]] (2nd century AD), and [[Straton of Sardis]] compiled his elegant \u039c\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b1 \u03a0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b7 (''Musa Puerilis'') from his productions and those of earlier writers.\n\nNo further collection from various sources is recorded until the time of Justinian, when epigrammatic writing, especially of an amatory character, experienced a great revival at the hands of [[Agathias of Myrina]], the historian, [[Paul the Silentiary|Paulus Silentiarius]], and their circle. Their ingenious but mannered productions were collected by Agathias into a new anthology, entitled ''The Circle'' (\u039a\u03c5\u03ba\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2); it was the first to be divided into books, and arranged with reference to the subjects of the pieces.\n\nThese and other collections made during the [[Middle Ages]] are now lost. The partial incorporation of them into a single body, classified according to the contents in 15 books, was the work of a certain Constantinus Cephalas, whose name alone is preserved in the single MS. of his compilation extant, but who probably lived during the temporary revival of letters under [[Constantine Porphyrogenitus]], at the beginning of the 10th century.\n\nHe appears to have merely made excerpts from the existing anthologies, with the addition of selections from [[Lucillius]], [[Palladas]], and other epigrammatists, whose compositions had been published separately. His arrangement, to which we shall have to recur, is founded on a principle of classification, and nearly corresponds to that adopted by [[Agathias]]. His principle of selection is unknown; it is only certain that while he omitted much that he should have retained, he has preserved much that would otherwise have perished.\n\nThe extent of our obligations may be ascertained by a comparison between his anthology and that of the next editor, the monk [[Maximus Planudes]] (AD 1320), who has not merely grievously mutilated the anthology of Cephalas by omissions, but has disfigured it by interpolating verses of his own. We are, however, indebted to him for the preservation of the epigrams on works of art, which seem to have been accidentally omitted from our only transcript of Cephalas.\n\nThe [[Planudean Anthology]] (in seven books) was the only recension of the anthology known at the revival of classical literature, and was first published at Florence, by [[Janus Lascaris]], in 1494. It long continued to be the only accessible collection, for although the Palatine manuscript known as the ''[[Palatine Anthology]]'', the sole extant copy of the anthology of Cephalas, was discovered in the [[Palatine library]] at [[Heidelberg]], and copied by [[Saumaise]] (Salmasius) in 1606, it was not published until 1776, when it was included in [[Richard Fran\u00e7ois Philippe Brunck|Brunck]]'s ''Analecta Veterum Poetarum Graecorum''.\n\nThe manuscript itself had frequently changed its quarters. In 1623, having been taken in the sack of Heidelberg in the [[Thirty Years' War]], it was sent with the rest of the Palatine Library to Rome as a present from [[Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria|Maximilian I of Bavaria]] to [[Pope Gregory XV]], who had it divided into two parts, the first of which was by far the larger; thence it was taken to [[Paris]] in 1797. In 1816 it went back to Heidelberg, but in an incomplete state, the second part remaining at Paris. It is now represented at Heidelberg by a photographic facsimile.\n\nBrunck's edition was superseded by the standard one of [[Christian Friedrich Wilhelm Jacobs|Friedrich Jacobs]] (1794\u20131814, 13 vols.), the text of which was reprinted in a more convenient form in 1813\u20131817, and occupies three pocket volumes in the [[Tauchnitz]] series of the classics.\n\n[[Image:Britmus01-greekanth1.jpg|right|thumbnail|325px|The van Bosch and van Lennep version of ''The Greek Anthology'' (in five vols., begun by Bosch in 1795, finished and published by Lennep in 1822).

It also reprints the very error-prone Greek text of the Wechelian edition (1600) of the Anthology, which is itself simply a reprint of the 1566 Planudean edition by [[Henry Estienne|Henricus Stephanus]].]]\nThe best edition for general purposes is perhaps that of [[Johann Friedrich D\u00fcbner|Dubner]] in [[Didot family#Ambroise-Firmin Didot|Didot]]'s ''Bibliotheca'' (1864\u20131872), which contains the ''Palatine Anthology'', the epigrams of the Planudean Anthology not collected in the former, an appendix of pieces derived from other sources, copious notes selected from all quarters, a literal Latin prose translation by [[Jean Fran\u00e7ois Boissonade]], [[Friedrich Heinrich Bothe|Bothe]], and [[A. J. Lapaume|Lapaume]] and the metrical Latin versions of [[Hugo Grotius]]. A third volume, edited by [[E. Cougny]], was published in 1890. The best edition of the Planudean Anthology is the splendid one by [[Hieronymus de Bosch|van Bosch]] and {{ill|David Jacob van Lennep|lt=van Lennep|nl|David Jacob van Lennep (1774-1853)}} (1795\u20131822). There is also an incomplete edition of the text by [[Hugo Stadtm\u00fcller]] in the [[Teubner]] series, 3 vols., which stops at IX 563 due to Stadtm\u00fcller's death.\nMore recent editions are one in the [[Collection des Universit\u00e9s de France]] series, 13 vols., started by Pierre Waltz and continued by other scholars, and one edited by [[Hermann Beckby]], 4 vols., in the [[Tusculum]] series. The most recent edition is by [[Fabrizio Conca]], [[Mario Marzi (classical scholar)|Mario Marzi]] and [[Giuseppe Zanetto]], 3 vols., published by [[UTET]].\n\n== Arrangement ==\nThe Palatine MS., the archetype of the present text, was transcribed by different persons at different times, and the actual arrangement of the collection does not correspond with that signalized in the index. It is as follows: Book 1. Christian epigrams; 2. Christodorus's description of certain statues; 3. Inscriptions in the temple at Cyzicus; 4. The prefaces of Meleager, Philippus, and Agathias to their respective collections; 5. Amatory epigrams; 6. Votive inscriptions; 7. Epitaphs; 8. The epigrams of Gregory of Nazianzus; 9. Rhetorical and illustrative epigrams; 10. Ethical pieces; 11. Humorous and convivial; 12. Strato's ''Musa Puerilis''; 13. Metrical curiosities; 14. Puzzles, enigmas, oracles; 15. Miscellanies. The epigrams on works of art, as already stated, are missing from the ''Codex Palatinus'', and must be sought in an appendix of epigrams only occurring in the Planudean Anthology. The epigrams hitherto recovered from ancient monuments and similar sources form appendices in the second and third volumes of D\u00fcbner's edition. The [[Liddell Scott Greek Lexicon]] divides the Anthologia Graeca sources into ''Anthologia Palatina, Planudea'' (1864-1968), then ''Appendix nova epigrammatum'' (1890 onward).<ref>Liddell Scott Greek Lexicon \"(Names of epigrammatists, where found in codd., are added in brackets.)

Four stages may be indicated:\n# The Hellenic proper, of which [[Simonides of Ceos]] (c. 556 \u2013 469&nbsp;BC), the author of most of the sepulchral inscriptions on those who fell in the [[Greco-Persian Wars|Persian wars]], is representative. Nearly all the pieces of this era are actual inscriptions or addresses to real personages, whether living or deceased.\n# The epigram received a great development in its second or Alexandrian era, when its range was extended to include anecdote, satire, and amorous longing; when epitaphs and votive inscriptions were composed on imaginary persons and things. The modification has a representative in [[Leonidas of Tarentum]], a contemporary of [[Pyrrhus of Epirus]], and closes with [[Antipater of Sidon]], about 140&nbsp;BC (or later). [[Callimachus]], one of the Alexandrian poets, affects stern simplicity in his epigrams.\n# [[Meleager of Gadara]] was a Syrian; his pieces are usually erotic, with far-fetched conceits. His gaiety and licentiousness are imitated and exaggerated by his somewhat later contemporary, the Epicurean [[Philodemus]],  and his  fancy reappears in Philodemus's contemporary, Zonas, in [[Crinagoras of Mytilene]], who wrote under Augustus, and in [[Marcus Argentarius]], of uncertain date. At a later period of the empire another ''genre'', was developed, the satirical. [[Lucillus of Tarrha]], who flourished under Nero, and [[Lucian]], display a talent for shrewd, caustic epigram. The same style obtains with [[Palladas]], an Alexandrian grammarian of the 4th century, the last of the strictly classical epigrammatists. His literary position is that of an indignant but despairing opponent of [[Christianity]].\n# The fourth or [[Byzantine]] style of epigrammatic composition was cultivated at the court of [[Justinian]]. The  diction of Agathias and his compeers is ornate.\n\n== Translations and imitations==\nLatin renderings of select epigrams by [[Hugo Grotius]] were published in [[Hieronymus de Bosch|Bosch]] and Lennep's edition of the Planudean ''Anthology'', in the Didot edition, and in [[Henry Wellesley (1794\u20131866)|Henry Wellesley]]'s ''Anthologia Polyglotta''. Imitations in modern languages have been copious, actual translations less common. [[F. D. Deh\u00e8que]]'s  1863 translation was in French prose. The German language admits of the preservation of the original metre, a circumstance exploited by [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] and [[Christian Friedrich Wilhelm Jacobs]].\n\n[[Robert Bland]], [[John Herman Merivale]], and their associates (1806\u20131813), produced efforts that are often diffuse. [[Francis Wrangham]]'s (1769\u20131842) versions are more spirited; and [[John Sterling (author)|John Sterling]] translated the inscriptions of Simonides. [[John Wilson (Scottish writer)|John Wilson]] in ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]'' 1833\u20131835, collected and commented on the labours of these and other translators, including indifferent attempts of [[William Hay (translator)|William Hay]].\n\nIn 1849 Henry Wellesley, principal of [[New Inn Hall, Oxford]], published his ''Anthologia Polyglotta'', a collection of the translations and imitations in all languages, with the original text. In this appeared versions by [[Goldwin Smith]] and Merivale, which, with the other English renderings extant at the time, accompany the literal prose translation of the ''Public School Selections'', executed by the Rev. [[George Burges]] for [[Bohn's Classical Library]] (1854).\n\nIn 1864 Major [[R. G. Macgregor]] published an almost complete but mediocre translation of the Anthology. ''Idylls and Epigrams'', by [[Richard Garnett (writer)|Richard Garnett]] (1869, reprinted 1892 in the Cameo series), includes about 140 translations or imitations, with some original compositions in the same style.\n\nFurther translations (selections) are: \n* [[Rosamund Marriott Watson|Graham R.

In his preface to his collection, Meleager describes his arrangement of poems as if it were a head-band or garland of flowers woven together in a tour de force that made the word \"Anthology\" a synonym for a collection of literary works for future generations.\n\nMeleager's ''Anthology'' was popular enough that it attracted later additions. Prefaces to the editions of [[Philippus of Thessalonica]] and [[Agathias]] were preserved in the ''Greek Anthology'' to attest to their additions of later poems. The definitive edition was made by [[Constantine Cephalas]] in the 10th century, who added a number of other collections: [[homoeroticism|homoerotic]] verse collected by [[Straton of Sardis]] in the 2nd century AD; a collection of [[Christianity|Christian]] epigrams found in churches; a collection of satirical and convivial epigrams collected by [[Diogenianus]]; [[Christodorus]]' description of statues in the Byzantine [[gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasium]] of [[Baths of Zeuxippos|Zeuxippos]]; and a collection of inscriptions from a temple in [[Cyzicus]].\n\nThe scholar [[Maximus Planudes]] also made an edition of the ''Greek Anthology'', which while adding some poems, primarily deleted or [[bowdlerized]] many of the poems he felt were too explicit. His anthology was the only one known to Western Europe (his autograph copy, dated 1301 survives; the first edition based on his collection was printed in 1494) until 1606 when [[Claudius Salmasius]] found in the library at [[Heidelberg]] a fuller collection based on Cephalas. The copy made by Salmasius was not, however, published until 1776, when [[Richard Fran\u00e7ois Philippe Brunck]] included it in his ''Analecta''. The first critical edition was that of F. Jacobs (13 vols. 1794\u20131803; revised 1813\u201317).\n\nSince its transmission to the rest of Europe, the ''Greek Anthology'' has left a deep impression on its readers. In a 1971 article on [[Robin Skelton]]'s translation of a selection of poems from the ''Anthology'', a reviewer for the ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'' wrote, \"The time of life does not exist when it is impossible to discover in it a masterly poem one had never seen before.\" Its influence can be seen on writers as diverse as [[Propertius]], [[Ezra Pound]] and [[Edgar Lee Masters]]. Since full and uncensored English translations became available at the end of the 20th century, its influence has widened still further.\n\n== Literary history ==\nThe art of [[occasional poetry]] had been cultivated in Greece from an early period\u2014less, however, as the vehicle of personal feeling than as the recognized commemoration of remarkable individuals or events, on sepulchral monuments and votive offerings: Such compositions were termed epigrams, ''i.e.'' inscriptions. The modern use of the word is a departure from the original sense, which simply indicated that the composition was intended to be engraved or inscribed.\n\nSuch a composition must necessarily be brief, and the restraints attendant upon its publication concurred with the simplicity of Greek taste in prescribing conciseness of expression, pregnancy of meaning, purity of diction and singleness of thought, as the indispensable conditions of excellence in the epigrammatic style. The term was soon extended to any piece by which these conditions were fulfilled.\n\nThe transition from the monumental to the purely literary character of the epigram was favoured by the exhaustion of more lofty forms of poetry, the general increase, from the general diffusion of culture, of accomplished writers and tasteful readers, but, above all, by the changed political circumstances of the times, which induced many who would otherwise have engaged in public affairs to addict themselves to literary pursuits. These causes came into full operation during the Alexandrian era, in which we find every description of epigrammatic composition perfectly developed.\n\nAbout 60&nbsp;BC, the sophist and poet [[Meleager of Gadara]] undertook to combine the choicest effusions of his predecessors into a single body of fugitive poetry. Collections of monumental inscriptions, or of poems on particular subjects, had previously been formed by [[Polemon of Athens|Polemon Periegetes]] and others; but Meleager first gave the principle a comprehensive application.\n\nHis selection, compiled from forty-six of his predecessors, and including numerous contributions of his own, was entitled ''The Garland'' ({{lang|grc|\u03a3\u03c4\u03ad\u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2}}); in an introductory poem each poet is compared to some flower, fancifully deemed appropriate to his genius. The arrangement of his collection was alphabetical, according to the initial letter of each epigram.\n\nIn the age of the emperor [[Tiberius]] (or [[Trajan]], according to others) the work of Meleager was continued by another epigrammatist, [[Philippus of Thessalonica]], who first employed the term anthology. His collection, which included the compositions of thirteen writers subsequent to Meleager, was also arranged alphabetically, and contained an introductory poem. It was of inferior quality to Meleager's.\n\nSomewhat later, under Hadrian, another supplement was formed by the sophist [[Diogenianus|Diogenianus of Heracleia]] (2nd century AD), and [[Straton of Sardis]] compiled his elegant \u039c\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b1 \u03a0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b7 (''Musa Puerilis'') from his productions and those of earlier writers.\n\nNo further collection from various sources is recorded until the time of Justinian, when epigrammatic writing, especially of an amatory character, experienced a great revival at the hands of [[Agathias of Myrina]], the historian, [[Paul the Silentiary|Paulus Silentiarius]], and their circle. Their ingenious but mannered productions were collected by Agathias into a new anthology, entitled ''The Circle'' (\u039a\u03c5\u03ba\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2); it was the first to be divided into books, and arranged with reference to the subjects of the pieces.\n\nThese and other collections made during the [[Middle Ages]] are now lost. The partial incorporation of them into a single body, classified according to the contents in 15 books, was the work of a certain Constantinus Cephalas, whose name alone is preserved in the single MS. of his compilation extant, but who probably lived during the temporary revival of letters under [[Constantine Porphyrogenitus]], at the beginning of the 10th century.\n\nHe appears to have merely made excerpts from the existing anthologies, with the addition of selections from [[Lucillius]], [[Palladas]], and other epigrammatists, whose compositions had been published separately. His arrangement, to which we shall have to recur, is founded on a principle of classification, and nearly corresponds to that adopted by [[Agathias]]. His principle of selection is unknown; it is only certain that while he omitted much that he should have retained, he has preserved much that would otherwise have perished.\n\nThe extent of our obligations may be ascertained by a comparison between his anthology and that of the next editor, the monk [[Maximus Planudes]] (AD 1320), who has not merely grievously mutilated the anthology of Cephalas by omissions, but has disfigured it by interpolating verses of his own. We are, however, indebted to him for the preservation of the epigrams on works of art, which seem to have been accidentally omitted from our only transcript of Cephalas.\n\nThe [[Planudean Anthology]] (in seven books) was the only recension of the anthology known at the revival of classical literature, and was first published at Florence, by [[Janus Lascaris]], in 1494. It long continued to be the only accessible collection, for although the Palatine manuscript known as the ''[[Palatine Anthology]]'', the sole extant copy of the anthology of Cephalas, was discovered in the [[Palatine library]] at [[Heidelberg]], and copied by [[Saumaise]] (Salmasius) in 1606, it was not published until 1776, when it was included in [[Richard Fran\u00e7ois Philippe Brunck|Brunck]]'s ''Analecta Veterum Poetarum Graecorum''.\n\nThe manuscript itself had frequently changed its quarters. In 1623, having been taken in the sack of Heidelberg in the [[Thirty Years' War]], it was sent with the rest of the Palatine Library to Rome as a present from [[Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria|Maximilian I of Bavaria]] to [[Pope Gregory XV]], who had it divided into two parts, the first of which was by far the larger; thence it was taken to [[Paris]] in 1797. In 1816 it went back to Heidelberg, but in an incomplete state, the second part remaining at Paris. It is now represented at Heidelberg by a photographic facsimile.\n\nBrunck's edition was superseded by the standard one of [[Christian Friedrich Wilhelm Jacobs|Friedrich Jacobs]] (1794\u20131814, 13 vols.), the text of which was reprinted in a more convenient form in 1813\u20131817, and occupies three pocket volumes in the [[Tauchnitz]] series of the classics.\n\n[[Image:Britmus01-greekanth1.jpg|right|thumbnail|325px|The van Bosch and van Lennep version of ''The Greek Anthology'' (in five vols., begun by Bosch in 1795, finished and published by Lennep in 1822).

It also reprints the very error-prone Greek text of the Wechelian edition (1600) of the Anthology, which is itself simply a reprint of the 1566 Planudean edition by [[Henry Estienne|Henricus Stephanus]].]]\nThe best edition for general purposes is perhaps that of [[Johann Friedrich D\u00fcbner|Dubner]] in [[Didot family#Ambroise-Firmin Didot|Didot]]'s ''Bibliotheca'' (1864\u20131872), which contains the ''Palatine Anthology'', the epigrams of the Planudean Anthology not collected in the former, an appendix of pieces derived from other sources, copious notes selected from all quarters, a literal Latin prose translation by [[Jean Fran\u00e7ois Boissonade]], [[Friedrich Heinrich Bothe|Bothe]], and [[A. J. Lapaume|Lapaume]] and the metrical Latin versions of [[Hugo Grotius]]. A third volume, edited by [[E. Cougny]], was published in 1890. The best edition of the Planudean Anthology is the splendid one by [[Hieronymus de Bosch|van Bosch]] and {{ill|David Jacob van Lennep|lt=van Lennep|nl|David Jacob van Lennep (1774-1853)}} (1795\u20131822). There is also an incomplete edition of the text by [[Hugo Stadtm\u00fcller]] in the [[Teubner]] series, 3 vols., which stops at IX 563 due to Stadtm\u00fcller's death.\nMore recent editions are one in the [[Collection des Universit\u00e9s de France]] series, 13 vols., started by Pierre Waltz and continued by other scholars, and one edited by [[Hermann Beckby]], 4 vols., in the [[Tusculum]] series. The most recent edition is by [[Fabrizio Conca]], [[Mario Marzi (classical scholar)|Mario Marzi]] and [[Giuseppe Zanetto]], 3 vols., published by [[UTET]].\n\n== Arrangement ==\nThe Palatine MS., the archetype of the present text, was transcribed by different persons at different times, and the actual arrangement of the collection does not correspond with that signalized in the index. It is as follows: Book 1. Christian epigrams; 2. Christodorus's description of certain statues; 3. Inscriptions in the temple at Cyzicus; 4. The prefaces of Meleager, Philippus, and Agathias to their respective collections; 5. Amatory epigrams; 6. Votive inscriptions; 7. Epitaphs; 8. The epigrams of Gregory of Nazianzus; 9. Rhetorical and illustrative epigrams; 10. Ethical pieces; 11. Humorous and convivial; 12. Strato's ''Musa Puerilis''; 13. Metrical curiosities; 14. Puzzles, enigmas, oracles; 15. Miscellanies. The epigrams on works of art, as already stated, are missing from the ''Codex Palatinus'', and must be sought in an appendix of epigrams only occurring in the Planudean Anthology. The epigrams hitherto recovered from ancient monuments and similar sources form appendices in the second and third volumes of D\u00fcbner's edition. The [[Liddell Scott Greek Lexicon]] divides the Anthologia Graeca sources into ''Anthologia Palatina, Planudea'' (1864-1968), then ''Appendix nova epigrammatum'' (1890 onward).<ref>Liddell Scott Greek Lexicon \"(Names of epigrammatists, where found in codd., are added in brackets.)

Four stages may be indicated:\n# The Hellenic proper, of which [[Simonides of Ceos]] (c. 556 \u2013 469&nbsp;BC), the author of most of the sepulchral inscriptions on those who fell in the [[Greco-Persian Wars|Persian wars]], is representative. Nearly all the pieces of this era are actual inscriptions or addresses to real personages, whether living or deceased.\n# The epigram received a great development in its second or Alexandrian era, when its range was extended to include anecdote, satire, and amorous longing; when epitaphs and votive inscriptions were composed on imaginary persons and things. The modification has a representative in [[Leonidas of Tarentum]], a contemporary of [[Pyrrhus of Epirus]], and closes with [[Antipater of Sidon]], about 140&nbsp;BC (or later). [[Callimachus]], one of the Alexandrian poets, affects stern simplicity in his epigrams.\n# [[Meleager of Gadara]] was a Syrian; his pieces are usually erotic, with far-fetched conceits. His gaiety and licentiousness are imitated and exaggerated by his somewhat later contemporary, the Epicurean [[Philodemus]],  and his  fancy reappears in Philodemus's contemporary, Zonas, in [[Crinagoras of Mytilene]], who wrote under Augustus, and in [[Marcus Argentarius]], of uncertain date. At a later period of the empire another ''genre'', was developed, the satirical. [[Lucillus of Tarrha]], who flourished under Nero, and [[Lucian]], display a talent for shrewd, caustic epigram. The same style obtains with [[Palladas]], an Alexandrian grammarian of the 4th century, the last of the strictly classical epigrammatists. His literary position is that of an indignant but despairing opponent of [[Christianity]].\n# The fourth or [[Byzantine]] style of epigrammatic composition was cultivated at the court of [[Justinian]]. The  diction of Agathias and his compeers is ornate.\n\n== Translations and imitations==\nLatin renderings of select epigrams by [[Hugo Grotius]] were published in [[Hieronymus de Bosch|Bosch]] and Lennep's edition of the Planudean ''Anthology'', in the Didot edition, and in [[Henry Wellesley (1794\u20131866)|Henry Wellesley]]'s ''Anthologia Polyglotta''. Imitations in modern languages have been copious, actual translations less common. [[F. D. Deh\u00e8que]]'s  1863 translation was in French prose. The German language admits of the preservation of the original metre, a circumstance exploited by [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] and [[Christian Friedrich Wilhelm Jacobs]].\n\n[[Robert Bland]], [[John Herman Merivale]], and their associates (1806\u20131813), produced efforts that are often diffuse. [[Francis Wrangham]]'s (1769\u20131842) versions are more spirited; and [[John Sterling (author)|John Sterling]] translated the inscriptions of Simonides. [[John Wilson (Scottish writer)|John Wilson]] in ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]'' 1833\u20131835, collected and commented on the labours of these and other translators, including indifferent attempts of [[William Hay (translator)|William Hay]].\n\nIn 1849 Henry Wellesley, principal of [[New Inn Hall, Oxford]], published his ''Anthologia Polyglotta'', a collection of the translations and imitations in all languages, with the original text. In this appeared versions by [[Goldwin Smith]] and Merivale, which, with the other English renderings extant at the time, accompany the literal prose translation of the ''Public School Selections'', executed by the Rev. [[George Burges]] for [[Bohn's Classical Library]] (1854).\n\nIn 1864 Major [[R. G. Macgregor]] published an almost complete but mediocre translation of the Anthology. ''Idylls and Epigrams'', by [[Richard Garnett (writer)|Richard Garnett]] (1869, reprinted 1892 in the Cameo series), includes about 140 translations or imitations, with some original compositions in the same style.\n\nFurther translations (selections) are: \n* [[Rosamund Marriott Watson|Graham R.

Frustrated, they requested help from Poggi, who had been working as a psychologist in Europe<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> and had previously worked for the PIP as a professor at the Center of Instruction (\"El Centro de Instrucci\u00f3n), also called the Officer School (\"Escuela De Oficiales\").<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> \n\nPoggi interrogated D\u00edaz Balb\u00edn for four days but was unable to elicit a confession.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> According to some sources, the police had asked Poggi to get a confession by using the \"scientific methods\" of the [[Nazis]] in the [[second world war]] (i.e., [[torture]]),<ref name=\":0\" /> but he still would not confess.

Many sources state that Poggi decided to kill D\u00edaz Balb\u00edn because he feared there was not enough evidence to prove D\u00edaz Balb\u00edn was the [[serial killer]], as the key witness who claimed to have seen D\u00edaz Balb\u00edn placing body parts in a trash bin decided not to testify.

However, D\u00edaz Balb\u00edn still did not confess.<!-- I think this is the author misrepresenting the truth. Based on blogs and such, it seems that this \"sexual\" account of the murder is portrayed in Poggi's semi-autobiographical movie, Mi Crimen Desnudo. The movie notably exaggerated and fictionalized a lot of elements, so perhaps the author mistakenly thought it was true? That's my hunch. --><ref name=\":8\" />\n\n=== Celebrity ===\nIn 1991, Poggi was released from jail. He decided to stay away from psychology after being released. He called himself \"Loco\" (Crazy), and dyed his hair green. He then became a celebrity. He was invited on to several television programs, many having poor ratings, and that looked for a \"sensational\" introduction or central topic.\n\nIn 1997, Poggi published his autobiography, \"''I Only Know I Am A Moron''\"(\"''Yo S\u00f3lo S\u00e9 Que Soy Un Imb\u00e9cil''), in a poor quality format with green ink and recurrent spelling, typographical and edition errors that according to the newspaper, El Siglo, was to show respect to the original message. It consisted of an introductory chapter with delusional quotes and some passages of his life \u2015 where he mixes popular characters and celebrities from the culture of Lima. The final chapter contained some of his drawings and some art critiques of his sculptures.\n\nIn 2000, Poggi participated in the filming of the movie ''My Nude Crime''\"(''Mi Crimen Al Desnudo''\"), by Le\u00f3nidas Zegarra, in which he played himself. The film was released in 2001. The project began in 1998, when a group of film students wanted to bring to the big screen the story of the murder of the serial criminal Angel D\u00edaz Balb\u00edn at the hands of psychologist Mario Poggi. Zegarra was invited to participate in the project as the director. The film's production was financed mainly by loans. The equipment needed was acquired in agreement with a production company. The budget, like in every movie by Zegarra, was  just $11.000 (equivalent to $16,388.72 as of 2019). Because of that, according to Zegarra, they came to an agreement with the actors and actresses (Mario Poggi, Am\u00e9rico Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, Yesabella, Rossi War, V\u00edctor \u00c1ngeles y Wilmer Ato) to pay them when the movie was commercialized, and when they retrieved the money invested.

Frustrated, they requested help from Poggi, who had been working as a psychologist in Europe<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> and had previously worked for the PIP as a professor at the Center of Instruction (\"El Centro de Instrucci\u00f3n), also called the Officer School (\"Escuela De Oficiales\").<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> \n\nPoggi interrogated D\u00edaz Balb\u00edn for four days but was unable to elicit a confession.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> According to some sources, the police had asked Poggi to get a confession by using the \"scientific methods\" of the [[Nazis]] in the [[second world war]] (i.e., [[torture]]),<ref name=\":0\" /> but he still would not confess.

He called himself \"Loco\" (Crazy), and dyed his hair green. He then became a celebrity. He was invited on to several television programs, many having poor ratings, and that looked for a \"sensational\" introduction or central topic.\n\nIn 1997, Poggi published his autobiography, \"''I Only Know I Am A Moron''\"(\"''Yo S\u00f3lo S\u00e9 Que Soy Un Imb\u00e9cil''), in a poor quality format with green ink and recurrent spelling, typographical and edition errors that according to the newspaper, El Siglo, was to show respect to the original message. It consisted of an introductory chapter with delusional quotes and some passages of his life \u2015 where he mixes popular characters and celebrities from the culture of Lima. The final chapter contained some of his drawings and some art critiques of his sculptures.\n\nIn 2000, Poggi participated in the filming of the movie ''My Nude Crime''\"(''Mi Crimen Al Desnudo''\"), by Le\u00f3nidas Zegarra, in which he played himself. The film was released in 2001. The project began in 1998, when a group of film students wanted to bring to the big screen the story of the murder of the serial criminal Angel D\u00edaz Balb\u00edn at the hands of psychologist Mario Poggi. Zegarra was invited to participate in the project as the director. The film's production was financed mainly by loans. The equipment needed was acquired in agreement with a production company. The budget, like in every movie by Zegarra, was  just $11.000 (equivalent to $16,388.72 as of 2019). Because of that, according to Zegarra, they came to an agreement with the actors and actresses (Mario Poggi, Am\u00e9rico Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, Yesabella, Rossi War, V\u00edctor \u00c1ngeles y Wilmer Ato) to pay them when the movie was commercialized, and when they retrieved the money invested. The movie also featured the well-known Peruvian singer [[La Tigresa del Oriente]] (In English: The Eastern Tigress) portraying [[Magaly Medina]], who became famous in the next decade for her music videos on YouTube.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://larepublica.pe/blogs/camaleon_con_zapatillas/2009/09/25/la-otra-tigresa-del-oriente-la-felina-que-no-colgo-su-video-en-youtube/|title= La otra Tigresa del Oriente: la felina que no colg\u00f3 su video en Youtube | first = Alfredo | last = P\u00e9rez Andrade | date=September 25, 2008 | language = Spanish | trans-title = The other Eastern Tigress: the feline who did not upload her video on YouTube |publisher=La Rep\u00fablica| url-status = dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712062644/http://larepublica.pe/blogs/camaleon_con_zapatillas/2009/09/25/la-otra-tigresa-del-oriente-la-felina-que-no-colgo-su-video-en-youtube/|archive-date=July 12, 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Death ===\nAccording the [[testimony]] of Poggi's brother, Mario Poggi suffered a cardiac arrest<ref name=\"Falleci\u00f33\"/> the night of February 25, 2016.
