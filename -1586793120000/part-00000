Genetic evidence suggests that the evolution of landlocked sockeye has occurred more than once with different kokanee populations, showing genetic differences between populations. Most evidence points to events that land-locked the lake-type sockeye (which spawns in streams and lakes, rather than tributaries like the sea-type sockeye, but is still anadromous and spends most of its adult life out at sea), which evolved into the non-anadromous form.<ref name=\"Lemay and Russello 2015\"/> Genetic evidence from kokanee in the [[Fraser River]] drainage and [[Columbia River]] drainage shows that ancestors of the kokanee came from the lake-type sockeye. The data also suggests that the kokanee may have evolved back into a lake-type anadromous form at some point in recent history, although there is a lack of interbreeding between it and sockeye in the drainage systems.

They are born in a stream and migrate down to a lake where they will spend most of their adult lives. Kokanee typically live for four years in a lake before heading back to [[spawning grounds]] to spawn and die. However, population longevity can vary between 2\u20137 years. A kokanee can spawn in a variety of different time periods called runs. Individual populations can have multiple runs associated with the kokanee in a lake and occur from August to February.

The broad subject range of behavioral hoplology means it also includes the effects that culture has had on man\u2019s evolution as a group-social animal.\n\nThere are three widely accepted axioms in hoplological studies.<ref name=\"hoplology.com\"/>\n\n* human combative behavior is rooted in man\u2019s [[Human evolution|evolution]]. \n* humans exhibit two types of aggression: affective aggression and predatory aggression.

The skill and potential of deadly aggression is something within human genetics which predisposes humans to violent behavior. However, the genetics that predispose humans to violence is highly influenced by environmental factors. Humans will only tap into their violent potential once the need has arisen. Human genetics have developed an on-off switch in the brain. On the on side \"\u2026the fighting activity itself is stimulated by individual and communal thrill, enjoyment in the competitive exercise of spiritual and physical faculties, and even cruelty, blood lust, and killing ecstasy.\" (Gat 2006) On the off-side violence is deterred away by emotions through fear, revulsion at violence and bloodshed, physical fatigue, compassion, and spirituality. So if the environmental factors that cause a man to be violent are present, then he will be violent. If the environmental factors that cause a man to be violent are not present, he will abstain and deter violence.<ref>Gat, Azar. War in Human Civilization. New York: Oxford UP, USA, 2006.

Under the flag of a \"[https://www.TheImmersionMedia.com New Hoplology]\" they conceptualized this study as an interdisciplinary project where in consideration of the diversity of its members, different research questions could be explored during the same project. One feeling shared among the group was to identify the most highly skilled exponents of combative systems. Those that were in the past and still today, first and foremost are seen and treated as combative arts that they have not evolved into modern recreations, sporting activities, folkloric representations of a past time. Next, they sought to conduct in-depth interviews and archive their system so s to provide a repository of data for future scholars and martial artists. Due to the nature of the project, these would be short term yet intensive research projects (typically ten 14-16 hour days of deep immersion in the cosmology, belief systems, history and combat methods). They are not meant to replace longer ethnographic research but to enhance and support other forms of research. \n\nThe multidisciplinary team, under the flag of the New Hoplology has organized the following expeditions to date\n\n# Bajan Sticklicking in the Caribbean \n# Trinidadian Kalinda and Toboggan Jab Jab in the Caribbean\n# [[Jogo do pau|Jogo De Pau]] expedition in Fafe, Portugal\n# [[Arnis|Eskrima]] in  Philippines \n# Maori Wrestling arts of Rongomomau \n\nThe first of these interdisciplinary expeditions was a roaring success in terms of collecting over 80 hours of film in a seldom seen art of  [[Bajan stick-licking|Bajan Sticklicking]].

The broad subject range of behavioral hoplology means it also includes the effects that culture has had on man\u2019s evolution as a group-social animal.\n\nThere are three widely accepted axioms in hoplological studies.<ref name=\"hoplology.com\"/>\n\n* human combative behavior is rooted in man\u2019s [[Human evolution|evolution]]. \n* humans exhibit two types of aggression: affective aggression and predatory aggression. Both forms evolved from different survival needs as both a group-social animal and as a hunting animal. \n* the evolution of human combative behavior is directly linked to the use of weapons. That is to say that the use of weapons is linked with and reflects combative performance and behavior.\n\nA variation on the pragmatics of hoplological understanding is found in theatrical representations of combat.<ref name=\"Meron Langsner\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dMUXQMBPyq4C&pg=PA112 |first=Meron |last=Langsner|title=Text & Presentation |date=2006 |publisher=McFarland |editor-first=Stratos E. |editor-last=Constantinidi |ISBN=0786455411 |chapter=Chapter 10.

The skill and potential of deadly aggression is something within human genetics which predisposes humans to violent behavior. However, the genetics that predispose humans to violence is highly influenced by environmental factors. Humans will only tap into their violent potential once the need has arisen. Human genetics have developed an on-off switch in the brain. On the on side \"\u2026the fighting activity itself is stimulated by individual and communal thrill, enjoyment in the competitive exercise of spiritual and physical faculties, and even cruelty, blood lust, and killing ecstasy.\" (Gat 2006) On the off-side violence is deterred away by emotions through fear, revulsion at violence and bloodshed, physical fatigue, compassion, and spirituality. So if the environmental factors that cause a man to be violent are present, then he will be violent. If the environmental factors that cause a man to be violent are not present, he will abstain and deter violence.<ref>Gat, Azar. War in Human Civilization. New York: Oxford UP, USA, 2006.

Under the flag of a \"[https://www.TheImmersionMedia.com New Hoplology]\" they conceptualized this study as an interdisciplinary project where in consideration of the diversity of its members, different research questions could be explored during the same project. One feeling shared among the group was to identify the most highly skilled exponents of combative systems. Those that were in the past and still today, first and foremost are seen and treated as combative arts that they have not evolved into modern recreations, sporting activities, folkloric representations of a past time. Next, they sought to conduct in-depth interviews and archive their system so s to provide a repository of data for future scholars and martial artists. Due to the nature of the project, these would be short term yet intensive research projects (typically ten 14-16 hour days of deep immersion in the cosmology, belief systems, history and combat methods). They are not meant to replace longer ethnographic research but to enhance and support other forms of research. \n\nThe multidisciplinary team, under the flag of the New Hoplology has organized the following expeditions to date\n\n# Bajan Sticklicking in the Caribbean \n# Trinidadian Kalinda and Toboggan Jab Jab in the Caribbean\n# [[Jogo do pau|Jogo De Pau]] expedition in Fafe, Portugal\n# [[Arnis|Eskrima]] in  Philippines \n# Maori Wrestling arts of Rongomomau \n\nThe first of these interdisciplinary expeditions was a roaring success in terms of collecting over 80 hours of film in a seldom seen art of  [[Bajan stick-licking|Bajan Sticklicking]].

Oxygen masks may cover only the nose and mouth (oral nasal mask) or the entire face (full-face mask). They may be made of [[plastic]], [[silicone]], or [[rubber]].\nIn certain circumstances, oxygen may be delivered via a [[nasal cannula]] instead of a mask.\n\n==Medical plastic oxygen masks==\nMedical plastic oxygen masks are used primarily by medical care providers for [[oxygen therapy]] because they are disposable and so reduce cleaning costs and infection risks. Mask design can determine accuracy of oxygen delivered with many various medical situations requiring treatment with oxygen. Oxygen is naturally occurring in room air at 21% and higher percentages are often essential in medical treatment. Oxygen in these higher percentages is classified as a drug with too much oxygen being potentially harmful to a patient's health, resulting in oxygen dependence over time, and in extreme circumstances patient blindness. For these reasons oxygen therapy is closely monitored. Masks are light in weight and attached using an elasticated headband or ear loops. They are transparent for allowing the face to be visible for patient assessment by healthcare providers, and reducing a sensation of claustrophobia experienced by some patients when wearing an oxygen mask. The vast majority of patients having an operation will at some stage wear an oxygen mask; they may alternatively wear a nasal cannula but oxygen delivered in this way is less accurate and restricted in concentration.\n\n==Silicone and rubber masks==\nSilicone and rubber oxygen masks are heavier than plastic masks. They are designed to provide a good seal for long-duration use by [[aviator]]s, medical research subjects, and [[hyperbaric medicine|hyperbaric chamber]] and other patients who require administration of pure oxygen, such as [[carbon monoxide poisoning]] and [[decompression sickness]] victims. Dr. [[Arthur H. Bulbulian]] pioneered the first modern viable oxygen mask, worn by World War II pilots and used by hospitals.<ref name=\"pmid8931286\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Stephenson RN, Mackenzie I, Watt SJ, Ross JA |title=Measurement of oxygen concentration in delivery systems used for hyperbaric oxygen therapy |journal=Undersea Hyperb Med |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=185\u20138 |date=September 1996 |pmid=8931286 |doi= |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/2245 |accessdate=2008-08-31}}</ref> [[Valves]] inside these tight-fitting masks control the flow of gases into and out of the masks, so that rebreathing of exhaled gas is minimised.\n\n==Hoses and tubing and oxygen regulators==\nHoses or tubing connect an oxygen mask to the oxygen supply. Hoses are larger in diameter than tubing and can allow greater oxygen flow. When a hose is used it may have a ribbed or corrugated design to allow bending of the hose while preventing twisting and cutting off the oxygen flow. The quantity of oxygen delivered from the storage tank to the oxygen mask is controlled by a valve called a [[Pressure regulator|regulator]]. Some types of oxygen masks have a breathing bag made of plastic or rubber attached to the mask or oxygen supply hose to store a supply of oxygen to allow deep breathing without waste of oxygen with use of simple fixed flow regulators.\n\n== {{Visible anchor|Oxygen masks for aviators}} ==\n[[File:T-37 solo student pilot.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A [[Cessna T-37 Tweet|T-37]] pilot wearing a mask designed for both diluter- and pressure-demand breathing]]\n[[Image:Tightlysealedmask.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Inner view of a military aviators mask showing face seal, facepiece and inhalation valves]]\n\n=== History ===\n\nAn early 1919 high-altitude oxygen system used a vacuum flask of liquid oxygen to supply two people for one hour at {{cvt|15000|ft}}.

Military aviators' oxygen masks have face pieces that partially cover the sides of the face and protect the face against flash burns, flying particles, and effects of a high speed air stream hitting the face during emergency evacuation from the aircraft by [[ejection seat]] or [[parachute]]. They are often part of a [[pressure suit]] or intended for use with a [[flight helmet]].\n\n=== Regulations ===\n\nThree main kinds of oxygen masks are used by [[aviators|pilots]] and crews who fly at high altitudes: continuous flow, diluter demand, and pressure demand.<ref name=FAAoxygen>{{cite web |url=http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgFinalRule.nsf/0/ff05904a31e9650086256895005bc71f!OpenDocument |publisher= FAA |title=Equipment standards for oxygen dispensing units. |date= February 28, 1984}}</ref>\n\nIn a ''continuous-flow system'', oxygen is provided to the user continuously. It does not matter if the user is exhaling or inhaling as oxygen is flowing from the time the system is activated.

They are designed to provide a good seal for long-duration use by [[aviator]]s, medical research subjects, and [[hyperbaric medicine|hyperbaric chamber]] and other patients who require administration of pure oxygen, such as [[carbon monoxide poisoning]] and [[decompression sickness]] victims.

Hoses are larger in diameter than tubing and can allow greater oxygen flow. When a hose is used it may have a ribbed or corrugated design to allow bending of the hose while preventing twisting and cutting off the oxygen flow. The quantity of oxygen delivered from the storage tank to the oxygen mask is controlled by a valve called a [[Pressure regulator|regulator]]. Some types of oxygen masks have a breathing bag made of plastic or rubber attached to the mask or oxygen supply hose to store a supply of oxygen to allow deep breathing without waste of oxygen with use of simple fixed flow regulators.\n\n== {{Visible anchor|Oxygen masks for aviators}} ==\n[[File:T-37 solo student pilot.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A [[Cessna T-37 Tweet|T-37]] pilot wearing a mask designed for both diluter- and pressure-demand breathing]]\n[[Image:Tightlysealedmask.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Inner view of a military aviators mask showing face seal, facepiece and inhalation valves]]\n\n=== History ===\n\nAn early 1919 high-altitude oxygen system used a vacuum flask of liquid oxygen to supply two people for one hour at {{cvt|15000|ft}}.

Military aviators' oxygen masks have face pieces that partially cover the sides of the face and protect the face against flash burns, flying particles, and effects of a high speed air stream hitting the face during emergency evacuation from the aircraft by [[ejection seat]] or [[parachute]]. They are often part of a [[pressure suit]] or intended for use with a [[flight helmet]].\n\n=== Regulations ===\n\nThree main kinds of oxygen masks are used by [[aviators|pilots]] and crews who fly at high altitudes: continuous flow, diluter demand, and pressure demand.<ref name=FAAoxygen>{{cite web |url=http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgFinalRule.nsf/0/ff05904a31e9650086256895005bc71f!OpenDocument |publisher= FAA |title=Equipment standards for oxygen dispensing units. |date= February 28, 1984}}</ref>\n\nIn a ''continuous-flow system'', oxygen is provided to the user continuously. It does not matter if the user is exhaling or inhaling as oxygen is flowing from the time the system is activated.

Anesthesia masks are either made of anti-static silicone or rubber, as a static electricity spark may ignite some anesthetic gases. They are either black rubber or clear silicone. Anesthesia masks fit over the mouth and nose and have a double hose system. One hose carries inhaled anesthetic gas to the mask and the other brings exhaled anesthetic gas back to the machine.

Full-face masks are secured by several straps. Tightly fitting oxygen masks are secured at four points by two head straps. Aviators' masks are often equipped with \"quick don\" harnesses that allow those in pressurized aircraft to rapidly don the masks in emergencies. Military aviators' oxygen masks are secured to flight helmets with quick-release systems.\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons category|Oxygen masks}}\n* {{annotated link|Emergency oxygen system}}\n* {{annotated link|Full face diving mask}}\n* {{annotated link|Nasal cannula}}\n* {{annotated link|Oxygen therapy}}\n* {{annotated link|Hyperbaric medicine|aka=Hyperbaric oxygen therapy}}\n* {{annotated link|Oxygen tent}}\n* {{annotated link|Bottled oxygen (climbing)}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n{{Dosage forms|state=expanded}}\n\n[[Category:Dosage forms]]\n[[Category:Drug delivery devices]]\n[[Category:Medical masks]]\n[[Category:Oxygen]]\n[[Category:Safety equipment]]\n[[Category:Respiratory therapy]]\n[[Category:Ambulances]]\n[[Category:Armenian inventions]]\n\n[[ja:\u30de\u30b9\u30af#\u305d\u306e\u4ed6\u306e\u30de\u30b9\u30af]]\n", "name_user": "Jmarchn", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_mask"}
