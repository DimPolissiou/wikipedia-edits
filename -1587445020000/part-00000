Generally, on the mainland, the climate of the U.S. becomes warmer the further south one travels, and drier the further west, until one reaches the West Coast.\n\nWest of the 100th meridian, much of the U.S. has a cold [[semi-arid]] climate in the interior upper western states (Idaho to Dakotas), to warm to hot [[desert]] and semi-arid climates in the southwestern U.S. East of the 100th meridian, the climate is [[humid continental]] in northern areas (locations roughly above 40 north latitude, Northern Plains, Midwest, Great Lakes, New England), transitioning into a humid [[temperate climate]] from the Southern Plains and lower Midwest east to the Middle Atlantic states (Virginia to southern Connecticut). \n\nA [[humid subtropical climate]] is found along and south of a mostly east-west line from the Virginia/Maryland capes (north of the greater [[Norfolk, Virginia]] area), westward to approximately northern Oklahoma, north of the greater [[Oklahoma City]] area. Along the Atlantic seaboard, the humid subtropical climate zone extends southward into central Florida. A [[Mediterranean climate]] prevails along most of the California coast, while southern [[Florida]] has a [[tropical climate]], the warmest region on the US mainland.<ref name=\"territories_climate1\">https://www.princeton.edu/~ota/disk3/1984/8426/842609.PDF Princeton.edu.

Coastal areas of Oregon and Washington have an [[oceanic climate]]. The state of [[Alaska]], on the northwestern corner of the North American continent, is largely dominated by a [[subarctic climate]], but with a subpolar oceanic climate in the southeast (Alaska Panhandle), southwestern peninsula and [[Aleutian Islands]], and a polar climate in the north.\n\nThe primary drivers of weather in the contiguous United States are the seasonal change in the solar angle, the migration north/south of the subtropical highs, and the seasonal change in the position of the polar jet stream.\n\nIn the Northern Hemisphere summer, the [[subtropical high]] pressure systems move northward and closer to the United States mainland. In the [[Atlantic Ocean]], the [[Bermuda High]] creates a south-southwest flow of tropical air masses over the southeastern, south-central and central United States - resulting in warm to hot temperatures, high humidity and  frequent intense (but usually brief) showers and/or [[thunderstorms]] as the heat builds in the afternoon. In the Northern Hemisphere summer, high pressure in the [[Pacific Ocean]] builds toward the California coast, resulting in a northwesterly airflow, creating the cool, dry, and stable weather conditions prevalent along the West Coast in summer.\n \nIn the Northern Hemisphere winter, the subtropical highs retreat southward. The polar jet stream (and associated conflict zone between cold, dry air masses from Canada and warm, moist air masses from the Gulf of Mexico) drops further southward into the United States - bringing more frequent periods of stormy weather, with rain, ice and snow, and much more variable temperatures, with rapid temperature rises and falls not uncommon. Areas in the southern U.S. (Florida, the Gulf Coast, the Desert Southwest, and southern California) however, often have more stable weather, as the polar jet stream's impact does not usually reach that far south.\n\nWeather systems, be they high-pressure systems (anticyclones), low-pressure systems (cyclones) or fronts (boundaries between air masses of differing temperature, humidity and most commonly, both) are faster-moving and more intense in the winter/colder months than in the summer/warmer months, when the belt of lows and storms generally moves into southern Canada.\n\nThe [[Gulf of Alaska]] is the origination area of many storms that enter the United States. Such \"North Pacific lows\" enter the U.S. through the [[Pacific Northwest]], then move eastward across the northern [[Rocky Mountains]], northern [[Great Plains]], [[upper Midwest]], [[Great Lakes]] and [[New England]] states. \nAcross the central states from late fall to spring, \"Panhandle hook\" storms move from the central Rockies into the Oklahoma/Texas panhandle areas, then northeast toward the Great Lakes. They generate unusually large temperature contrasts, and often bring copious Gulf moisture northward, resulting sometimes in cold conditions and possibly-heavy snow or ice north and west of the storm track, and warm conditions, heavy rains and potentially-severe thunderstorms south and east of the storm track - often simultaneously. \n\nAcross the northern states in winter usually from [[Montana]] eastward, \"Alberta clipper\" storms track east and bring light to moderate snowfalls from Montana and the Dakotas across the upper Midwest and Great Lakes states to New England, and often, windy and severe Arctic outbreaks behind them. When winter-season Canadian cold air masses drop unusually far southward, \"Gulf lows\" can develop in or near the Gulf of Mexico, then track eastward or northeastward across the Southern states, or nearby Gulf or South Atlantic waters. They sometimes bring rain, but can bring snow or ice across the South, mostly in interior or northern areas. \n \nIn the cold season (generally November to March), most precipitation occurs in conjunction with organized low-pressure systems and associated fronts. In the summer, storms are much more localized, with short-duration thunderstorms common in many areas east of the 100th meridian and south of 40 latitude. \n\nIn the warm season, storm systems affecting a large area are less frequent, and weather conditions are more solar {sun} controlled, with the greatest chance for thunderstorm and severe weather activity during peak heating hours, mostly between 3 PM and 9 PM local time. From May to August especially, often-overnight mesoscale-convective-system (MCS) thunderstorm complexes, usually associated with frontal activity, can deliver significant to flooding rainfall amounts from the Dakotas/Nebraska eastward across Iowa/Minnesota to the Great Lakes states. \n\nFrom late summer into fall (mostly August to October), [[tropical cyclones]] (hurricanes, tropical storms and tropical depressions) sometimes approach or cross the Gulf and Atlantic states, bringing high winds, heavy rainfall, and storm surges (often topped with battering waves) to Gulf and Atlantic lowlands and coastal areas.\n\n[[File:Record 1 day precipitation by USA county 1979 - 2011.png|thumb|upright=1.59|right|Record one day precipitation by county between 1979 and 2011.]]\n\n[[File:Average Annual High Temperature of the United States.jpg|thumb|upright=1.13|A map of the average annual high temperatures in the United States.]]\n\n==Regional overview==\n===Southwest===\nThe Southwest has a hot [[desert climate]], at lower elevations. Cities like [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Las Vegas]], [[Yuma, Arizona|Yuma]], and [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]] have average highs over 100&nbsp;\u00b0F (38&nbsp;\u00b0C) during the summer months and lows in the 70s or even 80s. In winter, daily temperatures in the southwest are cooler with highs in the 50s and 60s F, and lows in the 40s F.\n\nIn Phoenix, Las Vegas and similar Southwestern desert areas, on average June is the driest month, after Pacific-originating winter storms have concluded and before the Southwestern summer \"monsoon\" begins. The Southwest and the Great Basin are affected by said monsoon from the Gulf of California from July\u2013September. This results in some increase in humidity and cloud cover, bringing higher nighttime low temperatures and localized thunderstorms to the region, which can result in flash flooding. Further eastward in the desert Southwest ([[Tucson]], AZ eastward toward El Paso, TX), winter-season precipitation decreases, while the summer monsoon increasingly provides a summer precipitation maximum. For example, [[El Paso]] and [[Albuquerque, NM]] have a pronounced July to September precipitation maximum. Still, drought has been frequent in the region, often lasting for periods of years or longer. Forest fires across the Western United States (especially the southwest) occur many years, and can be severe to extreme in especially hot, dry summer seasons.\n[[File:Saguaro National Park - Flickr - Joe Parks.jpg|thumb|upright=1.11|[[Sonoran Desert]] at [[Saguaro National Park]]]]\nNorthern Arizona and New Mexico, central and northern Nevada and most of Utah (outside higher mountain areas) have a temperate semi-desert to desert climate, but with colder and snowier winters than in Phoenix and similar areas, and less-hot summers (as at [[Salt Lake City]], Utah). Summer high temperatures often reach the 90s, but low temperatures drop into the low 60s and even 50s. As in other temperate desert climates, the dry air results in large differences (sometimes over 40 degrees) between daytime high and nighttime low temperatures. Precipitation, though scarce, often falls year-round, influenced both by summer thunderstorms brought by the Southwestern monsoon (primarily in southern areas), and by winter-season storms from the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe coast of [[California]] has a [[Mediterranean climate]]. Daily high temperatures range from 70 to 80&nbsp;\u00b0F (21 to 27&nbsp;\u00b0C) in the summer to 50 to 65&nbsp;\u00b0F (10 to 16&nbsp;\u00b0C) in winter, with low temperatures from the 60&nbsp;\u00b0F (16&nbsp;\u00b0C)s in summer to the mid 40s F in winter.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Like most Mediterranean climates, much of coastal California has a wet winter and dry summer. Early summers can often bring cool, overcast weather (fog and low stratus clouds) to coastal California. As such, the warmest summer weather is delayed until August, even September in many areas of the California coast; on average, September is the warmest month in [[San Francisco]], CA. Upwelling of cold Pacific waters also contributes to the frequent cool spring and early summer weather in coastal California. In California's inland river valleys ([[Bakersfield]], [[Sacramento]] areas), the wet-winter, dry-summer pattern remains, but winters are cooler and more prone to occasional frost or freeze, while summers are much hotter, with blazing sunshine and daytime high temperatures not uncommonly in the 90s \u00b0F to over 100&nbsp;\u00b0F (38&nbsp;\u00b0C).\n\n===Gulf Coast/Lower Mississippi Valley/South Atlantic states===\nThe Gulf and South Atlantic states have a [[humid subtropical climate]] with mostly mild winters and hot, humid summers. Most of the [[Florida]] peninsula including [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]] and [[Jacksonville]], along with other coastal cities like [[Houston]], [[New Orleans]], [[Savannah, GA]], [[Charleston, SC]] and [[Wilmington, NC]] all have average summer highs from near 90 to the lower 90s F, and lows generally from 70 to 75&nbsp;\u00b0F (21 to 24&nbsp;\u00b0C); combined with moist tropical air, this creates the sultry summer weather conditions that prevail here.\n[[File:Cypresses.jpg|thumb|upright=1.11|right|Swamp in southern [[Louisiana]]]]\nIn the interior South, in cities like [[Raleigh]], NC, [[Atlanta]], [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], AL, [[Nashville]], TN and [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]], average summer highs and lows are similar to coastal areas, while some areas of interior eastern and central Texas (i.e. [[Dallas]], [[Austin]] and [[San Antonio]] areas) have average daily highs in the mid to upper 90s F. In winter, average daily high temperatures range from the 40&nbsp;\u00b0F (4&nbsp;\u00b0C)s (upper South: northern Arkansas, Kentucky and Virginia), to the 60&nbsp;\u00b0F (16&nbsp;\u00b0C)s along the Gulf Coast and South Atlantic coast (Charleston southward), with 70&nbsp;\u00b0F (21&nbsp;\u00b0C)s in central Florida and far southern Texas. Average daily lows in winter range from 20&nbsp;\u00b0F (\u22127&nbsp;\u00b0C)s north to 40&nbsp;\u00b0F (4&nbsp;\u00b0C)s along the Gulf and far South Atlantic coasts, with 50&nbsp;\u00b0F (10&nbsp;\u00b0C)s in Florida and coastal south Texas.\n\nMuch of the interior South (Tennessee, Kentucky and the northern Gulf states) has a winter or spring maximum in precipitation, with December, March or April typically the wettest month, and August to October the driest months - for example, at [[Birmingham, AL]], [[Huntsville, AL]], [[Tupelo, MS]] and [[Memphis, TN]]. From November to April, these areas commonly experience sharp conflicts between cold, dry air from Canada and warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico. These air-mass clashes often bring heavy winter and spring precipitation to the [[Mid-South (region)|Mid-South]]. Given the tropical air masses, summer-season thunderstorms can occur throughout the South, but they are heavier and more frequent along the Gulf Coast, South Atlantic coast (Norfolk, VA area southward), and in peninsular Florida. Along most of the Gulf coast (i.e. [[New Orleans, LA]], [[Mobile, AL]] and [[Pensacola, FL]] areas), and in South Atlantic coastal and sandhills areas (i.e. [[Columbia, SC]], [[Fayetteville, NC]], [[Raleigh, NC]], [[Wilmington, NC]], and [[Norfolk, VA]]), July and August are usually the wettest months, and precipitation is fairly evenly distributed the rest of the year. Primarily from August to early October, the coastal Gulf and South Atlantic states are susceptible to being struck by tropical weather systems (tropical depressions, tropical storms, and hurricanes). Even in winter, most precipitation falls as rain. However, occasionally frozen precipitation (snow, sleet and/or freezing rain) can occur (more commonly in interior and northern areas) when southerly-tracking storms throw Gulf or Atlantic moisture over cold air at ground level.\n\n[[Southern Florida]] has a [[tropical climate]], with all months having a mean temperature of higher than 65&nbsp;\u00b0F (18&nbsp;\u00b0C), a wet season from May through October, and a dry season from November through April. In cities like [[Fort Lauderdale]], [[Miami]], [[Key West, Florida|Key West]], [[Naples, Florida|Naples]], and [[Palm Beach, Florida|Palm Beach]] average daily highs range from the mid 70&nbsp;\u00b0F (21&nbsp;\u00b0C)s in winter to near 90&nbsp;\u00b0F (32-33&nbsp;\u00b0C) in summer. Average overnight lows range from the upper 50&nbsp;\u00b0F (10&nbsp;\u00b0C)s in winter to the mid and upper 70&nbsp;\u00b0F (21&nbsp;\u00b0C)s in summer. Southern Florida is the warmest region of the U.S. mainland in winter.\n\n===Southern Plains/Lower Midwest/Middle East Coast===\nThe region from the southern Plains, to the lower Midwest, eastward to the central East Coast (the New York City/coastal Connecticut region southward to Virginia) has a [[temperate climate]] climate with cool to cold winters and hot, humid summers. Daytime highs range from {{convert|80|to|90|F|C}} in summer to {{convert|35|to|50|F|C}} in winter. Lows range from the {{convert|60|F|C}}s in summer to {{convert|25|to|35|F|C}} in winter. Cities in this region include [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita, KS]], [[St. Louis|St. Louis, MO]], [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield, IL]], [[Indianapolis|Indianapolis, IN]], [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus, OH]], [[Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh, PA]], [[Philadelphia|Philadelphia, PA]], [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond, VA]], [[New York City|New York City, NY]], [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven, CT]], and [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City, NJ]]. Precipitation is spread fairly evenly throughout the year, though as one travels from Indiana westward there is an increasingly prominent early-summer concentration, with a May maximum in northern Texas and Oklahoma, and a June maximum increasingly evident from (central/northern) Indiana westward to Kansas. As one travels from east to west across Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas, average annual precipitation steadily decreases. Far western Texas ([[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]] area) is desert, and average annual precipitation is less than {{convert|20|in|mm|spell=in}} in westernmost Kansas and the Oklahoma Panhandle, where the climate qualifies as semi-arid.\n\nIn the lower Midwest (and southern Plains states, especially), temperatures can rise or drop rapidly; winds can be extreme; and clashing air masses, including hot, dry air of Mexican and/or Southwestern origin, warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico and cold, dry air from Canada can spawn severe thunderstorms and tornadoes, particularly from April to June. The \"[[dryline]],\" separating hot, dry air of Mexican/Southwestern U.S. origin from warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico, often causes severe, occasionally violent, thunderstorms to fire in central and eastern Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas; these sometimes contribute toward the hailstorms and [[tornado outbreak]]s that the Southern Plains are well known for. Reflecting these air-mass conflicts, central Oklahoma, including the [[Oklahoma City]] and [[Moore, Oklahoma|Moore]]-[[Norman, Oklahoma|Norman]] areas, has the highest frequency of tornadoes per unit land area on planet Earth, with May the highest-risk month for tornadoes throughout \"[[Tornado Alley]],\" from northern Texas north-northeastward toward western and central Iowa.\n\n===Northern Great Plains/North-Central/Great Lakes/New England===\nThe northern half of the Great Plains (Nebraska northward), northern Midwest, Great Lakes, and New England states have a [[humid continental climate]]. Here there are four distinct seasons, with warm to hot summers, and cold and often-snowy winters. Average daily high temperatures range from 10&nbsp;\u00b0F (\u221212&nbsp;\u00b0C)s (in North Dakota, and central and northern Minnesota) to 30&nbsp;\u00b0F (\u22121&nbsp;\u00b0C)s in winter to 70 to 80&nbsp;\u00b0F (21 to 27&nbsp;\u00b0C)s in summer, while overnight lows range from below 0&nbsp;\u00b0F (\u221218&nbsp;\u00b0C) in winter (in North Dakota and much of Minnesota) to 50 to 60&nbsp;\u00b0F (10 to 16&nbsp;\u00b0C)s in summer. In the New England states, precipitation is evenly distributed around the year, with a slight late fall-early winter (November\u2013December) maximum along the New England coast from Boston, MA northward due to intense early-winter storms. In the Great Lakes states, cold Arctic air in winter crossing the relatively warmer lake waters can result in frequent and sometimes very heavy [[lake-effect snow]], especially on the eastern and southern shores of the Great Lakes (for example, in western Michigan's Lower Peninsula and in the Buffalo, NY area). Cities in this area include [[Minneapolis, MN]], [[Omaha, NE]], [[Sioux Falls, SD]], [[Fargo, ND]], [[Chicago, IL]], [[Cleveland, OH]], [[Buffalo, NY]], [[Albany, NY]], [[Boston, MA]], [[Concord, NH]] and [[Augusta, ME]]. As one travels from east to west across Nebraska, South Dakota and North Dakota, average annual precipitation steadily decreases, and the westernmost counties of these states have a semi-arid climate, with about or just over 15 inches of precipitation per year, on average (see climate data for [[Williston, ND]], [[Rapid City, SD]] and [[Scottsbluff, NE]]).\n\nIn the upper Midwest and northern Plains states, temperatures may rise or fall rapidly, and winds (from warm-season thunderstorms or larger-scale low-pressure systems) can be strong to extreme. Here, air-mass conflicts primarily involve warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico, clashing with cool to cold, dry air from Canada, with only occasional intrusions of hot, dry air from the southwest. The conflicts between Canadian and Gulf air commonly produce severe thunderstorms (including hailstorms, especially on the western Plains) and tornadoes, particularly in May and June. In the northern Plains and North Central states generally, June is the year's wettest month on average, owing to maximum shower and thunderstorm activity. Also, June is the highest-risk month for severe weather throughout North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin and northern Illinois.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n===Pacific Northwest===\n[[File:Three Fingers seen from Lake Stevens WA.jpg|thumb|upright=1.11|[[Cascade Range]] in Washington]]\nThe Pacific Northwest has an [[oceanic climate]]. The climate is wet and cool in autumn, winter, and spring, and stable and drier in the summer months, especially July and August. On average, the wettest month is typically November or December; the driest, July. In the summer months, average highs in cities like Seattle and Portland are from 70 to 75&nbsp;\u00b0F (21 to 26&nbsp;\u00b0C) with lows from 50 to 59&nbsp;\u00b0F (10 to 15&nbsp;\u00b0C), while in winter daily highs are from 40 to 45&nbsp;\u00b0F (4 to 9&nbsp;\u00b0C) and overnight lows from 30 to 38&nbsp;\u00b0F (\u22121 to 4&nbsp;\u00b0C).{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nIn winter, the [[Pacific Northwest]] (especially coastal districts and other areas west, i.e. on the prevailing windward side, of the Olympic and Cascade mountain ranges), experiences a mostly overcast, wet and cool climate, but without severe cold like that found in the interior northern U.S. (i.e. Minnesota/North Dakota). At lower elevations, winter precipitation falls mostly as rain. However, snow does occur even at the lowest elevations, primarily when Pacific moisture interacts with cold air intruding into the Pacific Northwest from western Canada (i.e. Alberta and interior British Columbia).  Summers in the Pacific Northwest are generally cool, especially along the coastline. The Great Basin and Columbia Plateau (the Intermontane Plateaus) are arid or semiarid regions, with high summer temperatures in the 90s to occasionally over 100 at lower elevations (e.g. at [[Boise, ID]]), with annual precipitation averaging less than 15 inches (380&nbsp;mm) as a result of the rain shadow of the Sierra Nevada and Cascades.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Both coastal and interior areas of Oregon and Washington, and southern Idaho, have a wet-winter, dry-summer precipitation pattern, but traveling eastward into Montana and Wyoming, this transitions progressively (for example, at [[Missoula, MT]]) toward relatively drier winters and a May and eventually June precipitation maximum, the latter characteristic of the Northern Plains and much of the upper Midwest (i.e. both Dakotas, Nebraska, Iowa and Minnesota).\n\n===Alaska===\n{{expand section|date=January 2019}}\n''See also: [[Climate of Alaska]], [[Climate change in southeast Alaska]]''\n\nThe climate in [[Juneau]] and the [[Alaska Panhandle|southeast panhandle]] is a mid-latitude oceanic climate<ref>https://allenmarinetours.com/juneau/about/ Allenmarinetours.com Juneau.

The strip of land from north [[Texas]] north to [[Nebraska]] and east into [[Southern Michigan]] is known as [[Tornado Alley]], where many houses have tornado shelters and where many towns have tornado sirens. Stretching across [[Mississippi]] and [[Alabama]], [[Dixie Alley]] has experienced both tornadoes and violent thunderstorms, with peak tornado season coming on as early as February and waning by May. [[Florida]] also reports many tornadoes, but these rarely are very strong. The southern US has a second tornado season during the autumn. Generally, the area at greatest risk for tornadoes migrates northward from February to June, peaking in the Gulf States in February and March, the Ohio Valley and lower Midwest in April, southern and central Plains and central Midwest in May, and Northern Plains and upper Midwest (Dakotas, Minnesota, and Wisconsin) in June.\n\nBoth the Appalachian region and the Midwest experience the worst floods. Widespread severe flooding is rare. Some exceptions include the [[Great Mississippi Flood of 1927]], the [[Great Flood of 1993]], and widespread flooding and mudslides caused by the 1982\u201383 [[El Ni\u00f1o]] event in the western United States. Localized flooding can, however, occur anywhere. Mudslides from heavy rain can even cause problems in any mountainous areas, particularly in the Southwest. The narrow canyons of many mountain areas in the west and severe thunderstorm activity during the [[monsoon]] season in summer leads to sometimes devastating [[flash flood]]s as well. On the other hand, Nor'easter snowstorms can bring activity to a halt in both the New England and Great Lakes regions.\n\nIn 2013, the US sustains $10 billion annually in damage from floods.<ref>{{Cite news | first=Joel Banner | last=Baird | title=Stream-gage insight at risk from budget cuts | url=| work= | newspaper=[[The Burlington Free Press]] | location=[[Burlington, Vermont]] | pages= 3C | date=August 4, 2013 | id= | accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nThe Southwest has the worst droughts; one is thought to have lasted over 500 years and to have decimated the [[Anasazi]] people.<ref>O'Connor, Jim E. and John E.

Farmland failed throughout the Plains, entire regions were virtually depopulated, and dust storms ravaged the land. More recently, the western US experienced widespread drought from 1999 to 2004.\n\nIn terms of deaths from [[heatwaves]], 7,415 losses occurred between 1999 and 2010, a mean of 618 per year.

Generally, on the mainland, the climate of the U.S. becomes warmer the further south one travels, and drier the further west, until one reaches the West Coast.\n\nWest of the 100th meridian, much of the U.S. has a cold [[semi-arid]] climate in the interior upper western states (Idaho to Dakotas), to warm to hot [[desert]] and semi-arid climates in the southwestern U.S. East of the 100th meridian, the climate is [[humid continental]] in northern areas (locations roughly above 40 north latitude, Northern Plains, Midwest, Great Lakes, New England), transitioning into a humid [[temperate climate]] from the Southern Plains and lower Midwest east to the Middle Atlantic states (Virginia to southern Connecticut). \n\nA [[humid subtropical climate]] is found along and south of a mostly east-west line from the Virginia/Maryland capes (north of the greater [[Norfolk, Virginia]] area), westward to approximately northern Oklahoma, north of the greater [[Oklahoma City]] area. Along the Atlantic seaboard, the humid subtropical climate zone extends southward into central Florida. A [[Mediterranean climate]] prevails along most of the California coast, while southern [[Florida]] has a [[tropical climate]], the warmest region on the US mainland.<ref name=\"territories_climate1\">https://www.princeton.edu/~ota/disk3/1984/8426/842609.PDF Princeton.edu.

Coastal areas of Oregon and Washington have an [[oceanic climate]]. The state of [[Alaska]], on the northwestern corner of the North American continent, is largely dominated by a [[subarctic climate]], but with a subpolar oceanic climate in the southeast (Alaska Panhandle), southwestern peninsula and [[Aleutian Islands]], and a polar climate in the north.\n\nThe primary drivers of weather in the contiguous United States are the seasonal change in the solar angle, the migration north/south of the subtropical highs, and the seasonal change in the position of the polar jet stream.\n\nIn the Northern Hemisphere summer, the [[subtropical high]] pressure systems move northward and closer to the United States mainland. In the [[Atlantic Ocean]], the [[Bermuda High]] creates a south-southwest flow of tropical air masses over the southeastern, south-central and central United States - resulting in warm to hot temperatures, high humidity and  frequent intense (but usually brief) showers and/or [[thunderstorms]] as the heat builds in the afternoon. In the Northern Hemisphere summer, high pressure in the [[Pacific Ocean]] builds toward the California coast, resulting in a northwesterly airflow, creating the cool, dry, and stable weather conditions prevalent along the West Coast in summer.\n \nIn the Northern Hemisphere winter, the subtropical highs retreat southward. The polar jet stream (and associated conflict zone between cold, dry air masses from Canada and warm, moist air masses from the Gulf of Mexico) drops further southward into the United States - bringing more frequent periods of stormy weather, with rain, ice and snow, and much more variable temperatures, with rapid temperature rises and falls not uncommon. Areas in the southern U.S. (Florida, the Gulf Coast, the Desert Southwest, and southern California) however, often have more stable weather, as the polar jet stream's impact does not usually reach that far south.\n\nWeather systems, be they high-pressure systems (anticyclones), low-pressure systems (cyclones) or fronts (boundaries between air masses of differing temperature, humidity and most commonly, both) are faster-moving and more intense in the winter/colder months than in the summer/warmer months, when the belt of lows and storms generally moves into southern Canada.\n\nThe [[Gulf of Alaska]] is the origination area of many storms that enter the United States. Such \"North Pacific lows\" enter the U.S. through the [[Pacific Northwest]], then move eastward across the northern [[Rocky Mountains]], northern [[Great Plains]], [[upper Midwest]], [[Great Lakes]] and [[New England]] states. \nAcross the central states from late fall to spring, \"Panhandle hook\" storms move from the central Rockies into the Oklahoma/Texas panhandle areas, then northeast toward the Great Lakes. They generate unusually large temperature contrasts, and often bring copious Gulf moisture northward, resulting sometimes in cold conditions and possibly-heavy snow or ice north and west of the storm track, and warm conditions, heavy rains and potentially-severe thunderstorms south and east of the storm track - often simultaneously. \n\nAcross the northern states in winter usually from [[Montana]] eastward, \"Alberta clipper\" storms track east and bring light to moderate snowfalls from Montana and the Dakotas across the upper Midwest and Great Lakes states to New England, and often, windy and severe Arctic outbreaks behind them. When winter-season Canadian cold air masses drop unusually far southward, \"Gulf lows\" can develop in or near the Gulf of Mexico, then track eastward or northeastward across the Southern states, or nearby Gulf or South Atlantic waters. They sometimes bring rain, but can bring snow or ice across the South, mostly in interior or northern areas. \n \nIn the cold season (generally November to March), most precipitation occurs in conjunction with organized low-pressure systems and associated fronts. In the summer, storms are much more localized, with short-duration thunderstorms common in many areas east of the 100th meridian and south of 40 latitude. \n\nIn the warm season, storm systems affecting a large area are less frequent, and weather conditions are more solar {sun} controlled, with the greatest chance for thunderstorm and severe weather activity during peak heating hours, mostly between 3 PM and 9 PM local time. From May to August especially, often-overnight mesoscale-convective-system (MCS) thunderstorm complexes, usually associated with frontal activity, can deliver significant to flooding rainfall amounts from the Dakotas/Nebraska eastward across Iowa/Minnesota to the Great Lakes states. \n\nFrom late summer into fall (mostly August to October), [[tropical cyclones]] (hurricanes, tropical storms and tropical depressions) sometimes approach or cross the Gulf and Atlantic states, bringing high winds, heavy rainfall, and storm surges (often topped with battering waves) to Gulf and Atlantic lowlands and coastal areas.\n\n[[File:Record 1 day precipitation by USA county 1979 - 2011.png|thumb|upright=1.59|right|Record one day precipitation by county between 1979 and 2011.]]\n\n[[File:Average Annual High Temperature of the United States.jpg|thumb|upright=1.13|A map of the average annual high temperatures in the United States.]]\n\n==Regional overview==\n===Southwest===\nThe Southwest has a hot [[desert climate]], at lower elevations. Cities like [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Las Vegas]], [[Yuma, Arizona|Yuma]], and [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]] have average highs over 100&nbsp;\u00b0F (38&nbsp;\u00b0C) during the summer months and lows in the 70s or even 80s. In winter, daily temperatures in the southwest are cooler with highs in the 50s and 60s F, and lows in the 40s F.\n\nIn Phoenix, Las Vegas and similar Southwestern desert areas, on average June is the driest month, after Pacific-originating winter storms have concluded and before the Southwestern summer \"monsoon\" begins. The Southwest and the Great Basin are affected by said monsoon from the Gulf of California from July\u2013September. This results in some increase in humidity and cloud cover, bringing higher nighttime low temperatures and localized thunderstorms to the region, which can result in flash flooding. Further eastward in the desert Southwest ([[Tucson]], AZ eastward toward El Paso, TX), winter-season precipitation decreases, while the summer monsoon increasingly provides a summer precipitation maximum. For example, [[El Paso]] and [[Albuquerque, NM]] have a pronounced July to September precipitation maximum. Still, drought has been frequent in the region, often lasting for periods of years or longer. Forest fires across the Western United States (especially the southwest) occur many years, and can be severe to extreme in especially hot, dry summer seasons.\n[[File:Saguaro National Park - Flickr - Joe Parks.jpg|thumb|upright=1.11|[[Sonoran Desert]] at [[Saguaro National Park]]]]\nNorthern Arizona and New Mexico, central and northern Nevada and most of Utah (outside higher mountain areas) have a temperate semi-desert to desert climate, but with colder and snowier winters than in Phoenix and similar areas, and less-hot summers (as at [[Salt Lake City]], Utah). Summer high temperatures often reach the 90s, but low temperatures drop into the low 60s and even 50s. As in other temperate desert climates, the dry air results in large differences (sometimes over 40 degrees) between daytime high and nighttime low temperatures. Precipitation, though scarce, often falls year-round, influenced both by summer thunderstorms brought by the Southwestern monsoon (primarily in southern areas), and by winter-season storms from the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe coast of [[California]] has a [[Mediterranean climate]]. Daily high temperatures range from 70 to 80&nbsp;\u00b0F (21 to 27&nbsp;\u00b0C) in the summer to 50 to 65&nbsp;\u00b0F (10 to 16&nbsp;\u00b0C) in winter, with low temperatures from the 60&nbsp;\u00b0F (16&nbsp;\u00b0C)s in summer to the mid 40s F in winter.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Like most Mediterranean climates, much of coastal California has a wet winter and dry summer. Early summers can often bring cool, overcast weather (fog and low stratus clouds) to coastal California. As such, the warmest summer weather is delayed until August, even September in many areas of the California coast; on average, September is the warmest month in [[San Francisco]], CA. Upwelling of cold Pacific waters also contributes to the frequent cool spring and early summer weather in coastal California. In California's inland river valleys ([[Bakersfield]], [[Sacramento]] areas), the wet-winter, dry-summer pattern remains, but winters are cooler and more prone to occasional frost or freeze, while summers are much hotter, with blazing sunshine and daytime high temperatures not uncommonly in the 90s \u00b0F to over 100&nbsp;\u00b0F (38&nbsp;\u00b0C).\n\n===Gulf Coast/Lower Mississippi Valley/South Atlantic states===\nThe Gulf and South Atlantic states have a [[humid subtropical climate]] with mostly mild winters and hot, humid summers. Most of the [[Florida]] peninsula including [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]] and [[Jacksonville]], along with other coastal cities like [[Houston]], [[New Orleans]], [[Savannah, GA]], [[Charleston, SC]] and [[Wilmington, NC]] all have average summer highs from near 90 to the lower 90s F, and lows generally from 70 to 75&nbsp;\u00b0F (21 to 24&nbsp;\u00b0C); combined with moist tropical air, this creates the sultry summer weather conditions that prevail here.\n[[File:Cypresses.jpg|thumb|upright=1.11|right|Swamp in southern [[Louisiana]]]]\nIn the interior South, in cities like [[Raleigh]], NC, [[Atlanta]], [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], AL, [[Nashville]], TN and [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]], average summer highs and lows are similar to coastal areas, while some areas of interior eastern and central Texas (i.e. [[Dallas]], [[Austin]] and [[San Antonio]] areas) have average daily highs in the mid to upper 90s F. In winter, average daily high temperatures range from the 40&nbsp;\u00b0F (4&nbsp;\u00b0C)s (upper South: northern Arkansas, Kentucky and Virginia), to the 60&nbsp;\u00b0F (16&nbsp;\u00b0C)s along the Gulf Coast and South Atlantic coast (Charleston southward), with 70&nbsp;\u00b0F (21&nbsp;\u00b0C)s in central Florida and far southern Texas. Average daily lows in winter range from 20&nbsp;\u00b0F (\u22127&nbsp;\u00b0C)s north to 40&nbsp;\u00b0F (4&nbsp;\u00b0C)s along the Gulf and far South Atlantic coasts, with 50&nbsp;\u00b0F (10&nbsp;\u00b0C)s in Florida and coastal south Texas.\n\nMuch of the interior South (Tennessee, Kentucky and the northern Gulf states) has a winter or spring maximum in precipitation, with December, March or April typically the wettest month, and August to October the driest months - for example, at [[Birmingham, AL]], [[Huntsville, AL]], [[Tupelo, MS]] and [[Memphis, TN]]. From November to April, these areas commonly experience sharp conflicts between cold, dry air from Canada and warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico. These air-mass clashes often bring heavy winter and spring precipitation to the [[Mid-South (region)|Mid-South]]. Given the tropical air masses, summer-season thunderstorms can occur throughout the South, but they are heavier and more frequent along the Gulf Coast, South Atlantic coast (Norfolk, VA area southward), and in peninsular Florida. Along most of the Gulf coast (i.e. [[New Orleans, LA]], [[Mobile, AL]] and [[Pensacola, FL]] areas), and in South Atlantic coastal and sandhills areas (i.e. [[Columbia, SC]], [[Fayetteville, NC]], [[Raleigh, NC]], [[Wilmington, NC]], and [[Norfolk, VA]]), July and August are usually the wettest months, and precipitation is fairly evenly distributed the rest of the year. Primarily from August to early October, the coastal Gulf and South Atlantic states are susceptible to being struck by tropical weather systems (tropical depressions, tropical storms, and hurricanes). Even in winter, most precipitation falls as rain. However, occasionally frozen precipitation (snow, sleet and/or freezing rain) can occur (more commonly in interior and northern areas) when southerly-tracking storms throw Gulf or Atlantic moisture over cold air at ground level.\n\n[[Southern Florida]] has a [[tropical climate]], with all months having a mean temperature of higher than 65&nbsp;\u00b0F (18&nbsp;\u00b0C), a wet season from May through October, and a dry season from November through April. In cities like [[Fort Lauderdale]], [[Miami]], [[Key West, Florida|Key West]], [[Naples, Florida|Naples]], and [[Palm Beach, Florida|Palm Beach]] average daily highs range from the mid 70&nbsp;\u00b0F (21&nbsp;\u00b0C)s in winter to near 90&nbsp;\u00b0F (32-33&nbsp;\u00b0C) in summer. Average overnight lows range from the upper 50&nbsp;\u00b0F (10&nbsp;\u00b0C)s in winter to the mid and upper 70&nbsp;\u00b0F (21&nbsp;\u00b0C)s in summer. Southern Florida is the warmest region of the U.S. mainland in winter.\n\n===Southern Plains/Lower Midwest/Middle East Coast===\nThe region from the southern Plains, to the lower Midwest, eastward to the central East Coast (the New York City/coastal Connecticut region southward to Virginia) has a [[temperate climate]] climate with cool to cold winters and hot, humid summers. Daytime highs range from {{convert|80|to|90|F|C}} in summer to {{convert|35|to|50|F|C}} in winter. Lows range from the {{convert|60|F|C}}s in summer to {{convert|25|to|35|F|C}} in winter. Cities in this region include [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita, KS]], [[St. Louis|St. Louis, MO]], [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield, IL]], [[Indianapolis|Indianapolis, IN]], [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus, OH]], [[Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh, PA]], [[Philadelphia|Philadelphia, PA]], [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond, VA]], [[New York City|New York City, NY]], [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven, CT]], and [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City, NJ]]. Precipitation is spread fairly evenly throughout the year, though as one travels from Indiana westward there is an increasingly prominent early-summer concentration, with a May maximum in northern Texas and Oklahoma, and a June maximum increasingly evident from (central/northern) Indiana westward to Kansas. As one travels from east to west across Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas, average annual precipitation steadily decreases. Far western Texas ([[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]] area) is desert, and average annual precipitation is less than {{convert|20|in|mm|spell=in}} in westernmost Kansas and the Oklahoma Panhandle, where the climate qualifies as semi-arid.\n\nIn the lower Midwest (and southern Plains states, especially), temperatures can rise or drop rapidly; winds can be extreme; and clashing air masses, including hot, dry air of Mexican and/or Southwestern origin, warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico and cold, dry air from Canada can spawn severe thunderstorms and tornadoes, particularly from April to June. The \"[[dryline]],\" separating hot, dry air of Mexican/Southwestern U.S. origin from warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico, often causes severe, occasionally violent, thunderstorms to fire in central and eastern Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas; these sometimes contribute toward the hailstorms and [[tornado outbreak]]s that the Southern Plains are well known for. Reflecting these air-mass conflicts, central Oklahoma, including the [[Oklahoma City]] and [[Moore, Oklahoma|Moore]]-[[Norman, Oklahoma|Norman]] areas, has the highest frequency of tornadoes per unit land area on planet Earth, with May the highest-risk month for tornadoes throughout \"[[Tornado Alley]],\" from northern Texas north-northeastward toward western and central Iowa.\n\n===Northern Great Plains/North-Central/Great Lakes/New England===\nThe northern half of the Great Plains (Nebraska northward), northern Midwest, Great Lakes, and New England states have a [[humid continental climate]]. Here there are four distinct seasons, with warm to hot summers, and cold and often-snowy winters. Average daily high temperatures range from 10&nbsp;\u00b0F (\u221212&nbsp;\u00b0C)s (in North Dakota, and central and northern Minnesota) to 30&nbsp;\u00b0F (\u22121&nbsp;\u00b0C)s in winter to 70 to 80&nbsp;\u00b0F (21 to 27&nbsp;\u00b0C)s in summer, while overnight lows range from below 0&nbsp;\u00b0F (\u221218&nbsp;\u00b0C) in winter (in North Dakota and much of Minnesota) to 50 to 60&nbsp;\u00b0F (10 to 16&nbsp;\u00b0C)s in summer. In the New England states, precipitation is evenly distributed around the year, with a slight late fall-early winter (November\u2013December) maximum along the New England coast from Boston, MA northward due to intense early-winter storms. In the Great Lakes states, cold Arctic air in winter crossing the relatively warmer lake waters can result in frequent and sometimes very heavy [[lake-effect snow]], especially on the eastern and southern shores of the Great Lakes (for example, in western Michigan's Lower Peninsula and in the Buffalo, NY area). Cities in this area include [[Minneapolis, MN]], [[Omaha, NE]], [[Sioux Falls, SD]], [[Fargo, ND]], [[Chicago, IL]], [[Cleveland, OH]], [[Buffalo, NY]], [[Albany, NY]], [[Boston, MA]], [[Concord, NH]] and [[Augusta, ME]]. As one travels from east to west across Nebraska, South Dakota and North Dakota, average annual precipitation steadily decreases, and the westernmost counties of these states have a semi-arid climate, with about or just over 15 inches of precipitation per year, on average (see climate data for [[Williston, ND]], [[Rapid City, SD]] and [[Scottsbluff, NE]]).\n\nIn the upper Midwest and northern Plains states, temperatures may rise or fall rapidly, and winds (from warm-season thunderstorms or larger-scale low-pressure systems) can be strong to extreme. Here, air-mass conflicts primarily involve warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico, clashing with cool to cold, dry air from Canada, with only occasional intrusions of hot, dry air from the southwest. The conflicts between Canadian and Gulf air commonly produce severe thunderstorms (including hailstorms, especially on the western Plains) and tornadoes, particularly in May and June. In the northern Plains and North Central states generally, June is the year's wettest month on average, owing to maximum shower and thunderstorm activity. Also, June is the highest-risk month for severe weather throughout North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin and northern Illinois.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n===Pacific Northwest===\n[[File:Three Fingers seen from Lake Stevens WA.jpg|thumb|upright=1.11|[[Cascade Range]] in Washington]]\nThe Pacific Northwest has an [[oceanic climate]]. The climate is wet and cool in autumn, winter, and spring, and stable and drier in the summer months, especially July and August. On average, the wettest month is typically November or December; the driest, July. In the summer months, average highs in cities like Seattle and Portland are from 70 to 75&nbsp;\u00b0F (21 to 26&nbsp;\u00b0C) with lows from 50 to 59&nbsp;\u00b0F (10 to 15&nbsp;\u00b0C), while in winter daily highs are from 40 to 45&nbsp;\u00b0F (4 to 9&nbsp;\u00b0C) and overnight lows from 30 to 38&nbsp;\u00b0F (\u22121 to 4&nbsp;\u00b0C).{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nIn winter, the [[Pacific Northwest]] (especially coastal districts and other areas west, i.e. on the prevailing windward side, of the Olympic and Cascade mountain ranges), experiences a mostly overcast, wet and cool climate, but without severe cold like that found in the interior northern U.S. (i.e. Minnesota/North Dakota). At lower elevations, winter precipitation falls mostly as rain. However, snow does occur even at the lowest elevations, primarily when Pacific moisture interacts with cold air intruding into the Pacific Northwest from western Canada (i.e. Alberta and interior British Columbia).  Summers in the Pacific Northwest are generally cool, especially along the coastline. The Great Basin and Columbia Plateau (the Intermontane Plateaus) are arid or semiarid regions, with high summer temperatures in the 90s to occasionally over 100 at lower elevations (e.g. at [[Boise, ID]]), with annual precipitation averaging less than 15 inches (380&nbsp;mm) as a result of the rain shadow of the Sierra Nevada and Cascades.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Both coastal and interior areas of Oregon and Washington, and southern Idaho, have a wet-winter, dry-summer precipitation pattern, but traveling eastward into Montana and Wyoming, this transitions progressively (for example, at [[Missoula, MT]]) toward relatively drier winters and a May and eventually June precipitation maximum, the latter characteristic of the Northern Plains and much of the upper Midwest (i.e. both Dakotas, Nebraska, Iowa and Minnesota).\n\n===Alaska===\n{{expand section|date=January 2019}}\n''See also: [[Climate of Alaska]], [[Climate change in southeast Alaska]]''\n\nThe climate in [[Juneau]] and the [[Alaska Panhandle|southeast panhandle]] is a mid-latitude oceanic climate<ref>https://allenmarinetours.com/juneau/about/ Allenmarinetours.com Juneau.

In central portions of the U.S., [[tornado]]es are more common than anywhere else in the world.<ref>NOVA, [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/tornado/country.html Tornado Heaven], ''Hunt for the Supertwister'', ''URL accessed 15 June 2006.''</ref> They usually can touch down during the spring and the summer. The strip of land from north [[Texas]] north to [[Nebraska]] and east into [[Southern Michigan]] is known as [[Tornado Alley]], where many houses have tornado shelters and where many towns have tornado sirens. Stretching across [[Mississippi]] and [[Alabama]], [[Dixie Alley]] has experienced both tornadoes and violent thunderstorms, with peak tornado season coming on as early as February and waning by May. [[Florida]] also reports many tornadoes, but these rarely are very strong. The southern US has a second tornado season during the autumn. Generally, the area at greatest risk for tornadoes migrates northward from February to June, peaking in the Gulf States in February and March, the Ohio Valley and lower Midwest in April, southern and central Plains and central Midwest in May, and Northern Plains and upper Midwest (Dakotas, Minnesota, and Wisconsin) in June.\n\nBoth the Appalachian region and the Midwest experience the worst floods. Widespread severe flooding is rare. Some exceptions include the [[Great Mississippi Flood of 1927]], the [[Great Flood of 1993]], and widespread flooding and mudslides caused by the 1982\u201383 [[El Ni\u00f1o]] event in the western United States. Localized flooding can, however, occur anywhere. Mudslides from heavy rain can even cause problems in any mountainous areas, particularly in the Southwest. The narrow canyons of many mountain areas in the west and severe thunderstorm activity during the [[monsoon]] season in summer leads to sometimes devastating [[flash flood]]s as well. On the other hand, Nor'easter snowstorms can bring activity to a halt in both the New England and Great Lakes regions.\n\nIn 2013, the US sustains $10 billion annually in damage from floods.<ref>{{Cite news | first=Joel Banner | last=Baird | title=Stream-gage insight at risk from budget cuts | url=| work= | newspaper=[[The Burlington Free Press]] | location=[[Burlington, Vermont]] | pages= 3C | date=August 4, 2013 | id= | accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nThe Southwest has the worst droughts; one is thought to have lasted over 500 years and to have decimated the [[Anasazi]] people.<ref>O'Connor, Jim E. and John E. Costa, [http://pubs.usgs.gov/circ/2003/circ1245 Large Floods in the United States: Where They Happen and Why], ''US Geological Survey Circular 1245'', ''URL accessed 13 June 2006.''</ref> Large stretches of desert shrub in the west can fuel the spreads of [[wildfire]]s. Although severe drought is rare, it has occasionally caused some major problems, such as those during the [[Dust Bowl]] (1931\u20131942), which coincided with the [[Great Depression]]. Farmland failed throughout the Plains, entire regions were virtually depopulated, and dust storms ravaged the land. More recently, the western US experienced widespread drought from 1999 to 2004.\n\nIn terms of deaths from [[heatwaves]], 7,415 losses occurred between 1999 and 2010, a mean of 618 per year. A disproportionate number of men, a full 68% of deaths, versus women have been affected. The highest yearly total of heat-related deaths during that time frame was in 1999. The lowest was in 2004.<ref>[https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6136a6.htm QuickStats: Number of Heat-Related Deaths,* by Sex \u2014 National Vital Statistics System, United States,\u2020 1999\u20132010\u00a7].

From 1979 to 2002, 16,555 deaths occurred due to exposure to excessive cold temperatures, a mean of 689 per year.<ref>[https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5407a4.htm Hypothermia-Related Deaths - United States, 2003-2004].

It was later discovered that the radioactivity levels matched the design, but that the regulations concerning acceptable radioactivity levels had changed. While the United States was preparing its response to the [[September 11 attacks]] in the form of [[Operation Enduring Freedom]], French media complained about the lack of deployable French military power. At the same time, the Defence Commission reported the maintenance of the Fleet to be substandard. In this context, ''Charles de Gaulle'', then under repairs, was again an object of criticism, with former President [[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing]] describing it as a \"half-aircraft-carrier\" and requesting launching of the second carrier vessel (named PA2) in order to guarantee an availability rate of 100%.\n\n===Maintenance and upgrades===\n''Charles de Gaulle'''s first major [[Refueling and Overhaul|overhaul]] began in September 2007.

Although 24 Rafales, divided into two squadrons, are expected to be embarked usually some aircraft remain in France for upgrade or training. US Navy F-18 Hornets and C-2 Greyhounds conduct regularly qualification traps and launches from CdG. In June 2011 two US Navy C-2A(R) Greyhounds were assigned to French Navy to conduct operational carrier on-board delivery (COD) missions for CdG during the NATO intervention in Libya.\n\nIn 2019 CdG operated 35 aircraft during exercises, its record: two Dauphin helicopters, thirty Rafale M, two E-2C Hawkeye and one NH90 NFH Caiman. In event of war CdG is expected to operate close to full complement of 40 aircraft.

While the United States was preparing its response to the [[September 11 attacks]] in the form of [[Operation Enduring Freedom]], French media complained about the lack of deployable French military power. At the same time, the Defence Commission reported the maintenance of the Fleet to be substandard. In this context, ''Charles de Gaulle'', then under repairs, was again an object of criticism, with former President [[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing]] describing it as a \"half-aircraft-carrier\" and requesting launching of the second carrier vessel (named PA2) in order to guarantee an availability rate of 100%.\n\n===Maintenance and upgrades===\n''Charles de Gaulle'''s first major [[Refueling and Overhaul|overhaul]] began in September 2007.

Typically two Rafale squadrons are expected to rotate in CdG carrier air group. A pair of E-2C would supplement them. In peacetime number of planes on board may be probably lower: 14/24 Rafale M, 2 E-2C Hawkeye and 2/4 AS365 Dauphin helicopters. Although 24 Rafales, divided into two squadrons, are expected to be embarked usually some aircraft remain in France for upgrade or training. US Navy F-18 Hornets and C-2 Greyhounds conduct regularly qualification traps and launches from CdG. In June 2011 two US Navy C-2A(R) Greyhounds were assigned to French Navy to conduct operational carrier on-board delivery (COD) missions for CdG during the NATO intervention in Libya.\n\nIn 2019 CdG operated 35 aircraft during exercises, its record: two Dauphin helicopters, thirty Rafale M, two E-2C Hawkeye and one NH90 NFH Caiman. In event of war CdG is expected to operate close to full complement of 40 aircraft. CdG air group took part in combat operations in Afghanistan, Syria  and Libya.\n\n==French aircraft carrier procurement==\n[[File:HMS Kent carries out manoeuvres with French Ship FS Charles De Gaulle.

This scheme requires another aircraft carrier to be built; however, ''Charles de Gaulle'' is the only aircraft carrier currently serving.\n\nCost considerations have made equipment standardization a necessity. In this context, there is a possibility of collaboration with Britain for future aircraft carriers.
