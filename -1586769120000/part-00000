{"title_page": "Socialism and LGBT rights", "text_new": "{{Socialism sidebar| expanded=History by country}}The connection between left-leaning ideologies and [[LGBT rights]] struggles has a long and mixed history. Prominent [[socialist]]s who were involved in early struggles for LGBT rights include [[Edward Carpenter]], [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Harry Hay]], [[Bayard Rustin]], [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Daniel Gu\u00e9rin]] among others.\n\n==History==\n\n===The sexual politics of utopian socialism===\n[[File:Hw-fourier.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Charles Fourier]], [[Utopian socialist]] who coined the word [[feminism]] in 1837 and defended same-sex sexuality.]]\nThe first currents of modern socialist thought emerged in Europe in the early 19th century. They are now often described with the phrase [[utopian socialism]]. Gender and sexuality were significant concerns for many of the leading thinkers, such as [[Charles Fourier]] and [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, Comte de Saint-Simon|Henri de Saint-Simon]] in France and [[Robert Owen]] in Britain, as well as their followers, many of whom were women. For Fourier, for example, true freedom could only occur without masters, without the ethos of work, and without suppressing passions; the suppression of passions is not only destructive to the individual, but to society as a whole. Writing before the advent of the term 'homosexuality', Fourier recognized that both men and women have a wide range of sexual needs and preferences which may change throughout their lives, including same-sex sexuality and ''androg\u00e9nit\u00e9''. He argued that all sexual expressions should be enjoyed as long as people are not abused, and that \"affirming one's difference\" can actually enhance social integration.<ref>[[Charles Fourier]], ''Le Nouveau Monde Lamoureux'' (written 1816-18, not published widely until 1967: Paris: \u00c9ditions Anthropos). pp. 389, 391, 429, 458, 459, 462, and 463.</ref> \n this information is wrong\n\n===Germany===\n[[File:Jean Baptista von Schweizer, ADA president.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Jean Baptista von Schweitzer]], German socialist arrested on a homosexual charge in 1862.]]\nFrom the earliest European homosexual rights movements, activists such as [[Karl-Heinrich Ulrichs]] and [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] approached the Left for support. During the 1860s, Ulrichs wrote to [[Karl Marx]] and sent him a number of books on [[Uranian]] (homosexual/transgender) emancipation, and in 1869 Marx passed one of Ulrich's books on to Engels.<ref>Most of the information on this incident is taken from: Kennedy, Hubert, ''Johann Baptist von Schweitzer: The Queer Marx Loved to Hate''. In: 'Journal of Homosexuality' (ISSN 0091-8369) Volume: 29 Issue: 2/3, pp 69-96. Hereafter, original sources cited by Kennedy are given.</ref> Engels responded with disgust to Marx in a private letter, lashing out at \"pederasts\" who are \"extremely against nature\", and described Ulrichs' platform of homosexual rights as \"turning smut into theory\". He worried that things would go badly for heterosexuals like himself should homosexual rights be gained.<ref>The letter, dated June 22, 1869, is published in [[Karl Marx|Marx, Karl]], [[Frederick Engels|Engels, Friedrich]]: ''Collected Works'', vols. 42, 43 (New York: International,1988), 43: 295\u201396</ref>\n\nKnown to both Ulrichs and Marx was the case of [[Jean Baptista von Schweitzer]], an important labor organiser who had been charged with attempting to solicit a teenage boy in a park in 1862. [[Social democrat]] leader [[Ferdinand Lassalle]] defended Schweitzer on the grounds that while he personally found homosexuality to be dirty, the labor movement needed the leadership of Schweitzer too much to abandon him, and that a person's sexual tastes had \"absolutely nothing to do with a man\u2019s political character\".<ref>Linsert, Richard. 1931.

(1995). p. 14</ref> can be seen as another example of the ambiguous position towards homosexuality in the German labor movement. On the one hand, Bebel warned socialists of the dangers of same-sex love. Bebel attributed \"this crime against nature\" in both men and women to sexual indulgence and excess, describing it as an upper-class, metropolitan and foreign vice.<ref>[[August Bebel|Bebel, August]] (1879). ''Woman under Socialism''. translated by Daniel De Leon, New York: New York Labor Press, 1904. pp 164 - 165. In a footnote added in 1909, he remarked that the [[Harden-Eulenburg Affair|Eulenburg scandal]] proved that homosexuality was widespread in the upper classes.</ref> On the other hand, he did publicly support the efforts to legalize homosexuality. For example, he signed the first petition of the \"Wissenschaftlich-humanit\u00e4rer Kreis\", a study group led by Magnus Hirschfeld, trying to explain homosexuality from a scientific point of view and pushing for decriminalization.<ref>Hirschfeld, Magnus (2000) The Homosexuality of Men and Women.

Hirschfeld, who was also a socialist and supporter of the [[First-wave feminism|Women's Movement]], formed the [[Scientific-Humanitarian Committee]] to campaign against [[Paragraph 175|German Penal Code Section 175]] which outlawed male-male sex. Hirschfeld's organisation did a deal with the SPD (of which Lassalle and Schweitzer had been members) to get them to put forward a bill in the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]] in 1898, but it was opposed in the Reichstag and failed to pass. Most of Hirschfeld's circle of homosexual activists had socialist politics, including [[Kurt Hiller]], [[Richard Linsert]], [[Johanna Elberskirchen]] and [[Bruno Vogel]]. After the toppling of the German monarchy, the struggle against \u00a7 175 was continued by some social democrats. The German Minister of Justice Gustav Radbruch, member of the Social Democratic Party, tried to erase the paragraphe from the German penal law. However, his efforts were to no avail.\n\n===Britain===\n[[File:Edward Carpenter (1905).jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Edward Carpenter]], influential British socialist within the [[Fabian Society]], the [[Labour Party (UK)]] and early LGBTI activist and theorist]]\nIn [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[The Soul of Man Under Socialism]]'', he advocates for an [[egalitarian]] society where wealth is shared by all, while warning of the dangers of authoritarian socialism that would crush individuality.<ref name=\"theanarchistlibrary1\">[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Kristian_Williams__The_Soul_of_Man_Under..._Anarchism_.html Kristian Williams. \"The Soul of Man Under...

I am something of an Anarchist, I believe.\".<ref>According to his biographer Neil McKenna, Wilde was part of a secret organisation that aimed to legalise homosexuality, and was known among the group as a leader of \"the Cause\". (McKenna, Neil. 2003. ''The Secret Life of Oscar Wilde''.)</ref> \"In August 1894, Wilde wrote to his lover, Lord Alfred Douglas, to tell of \"a dangerous adventure.\" He had gone out sailing with two lovely boys, Stephen and Alphonso, and they were caught in a storm. \"We took five hours in an awful gale to come back! [And we] did not reach pier till eleven o\u2019clock at night, pitch dark all the way, and a fearful sea. . . . All the fishermen were waiting for us.\"...Tired, cold, and \"wet to the skin,\" the three men immediately \"flew to the hotel for hot brandy and water.\" But there was a problem. The law stood in the way: \"As it was past ten o\u2019clock on a Sunday night the proprietor could not sell us any brandy or spirits of any kind! So he had to give it to us. The result was not displeasing, but what laws!\"...Wilde finishes the story: \"Both Alphonso and Stephen are now anarchists, I need hardly say.\"\"<ref name=\"theanarchistlibrary1\"/>\n\n[[Edward Carpenter]] was a leading figure in late 19th- and early 20th-century Britain being instrumental in the foundation of the [[Fabian Society]] and the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. The 1890s saw Carpenter in a concerted effort to campaign against discrimination on the grounds of [[sexual orientation]]. He strongly believed that same-sex attraction was a natural orientation for people of a [[Third gender|third sex]]. His 1908 book on the subject, ''[[The Intermediate Sex]]'', would become a foundational text of the [[LGBT movements]] of the 20th century. ''The Intermediate Sex: A Study of Some Transitional Types of Men and Women'' expressed his views on homosexuality. Carpenter argues that \"uranism\", as he terms homosexuality, was on the increase marking a new age of sexual liberation.<ref>Flood, M. (2007) International Encyclopedia of Men and Masculinities, Routledge: Abingdon, p. 315</ref> He continued to work in the early part of the 20th century composing works on the \"Homogenic question\". The publication in 1902 of his groundbreaking [[anthology]] of poems, ''[[Iolaus|Iol\u00e4us]]: An Anthology of Friendship'', was a huge underground success, leading to a more advanced knowledge of [[homoeroticism|homoerotic]] culture.<ref name=\"Ref_d\">The 1917 New York edition is now available as a free [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/pwh/iolaus.html online e-book]</ref> In April 1914, Carpenter and his friend Laurence Houseman founded the British Society for the Study of Sex Psychology. Some of the topics addressed in lecture and publication by the society included: the promotion of the scientific study of sex; a more rational attitude towards sexual conduct and problems and questions connected with sexual psychology (from medical, juridical, and sociological aspects), birth control, abortion, sterilization, venereal diseases, and all aspects of prostitution.\n\n==Anarchism, libertarian socialism and LGBT rights==\n{{Main|Anarcho-queer}}\nIn Europe and North America, the [[free love movement]] combined ideas revived from utopian socialism with anarchism and [[feminism]] to attack the \"hypocritical\" [[Victorian morality|sexual morality of the Victorian era]], and the institutions of marriage and the family that were alleged to enslave women. Free lovers advocated voluntary sexual unions with no state interference<ref>See, for example, [[Ezra Heywood|Heywood, Ezra]], 1876.

For a few decades, adherence to \"free love\" became widespread among European and American [[Anarchism|anarchists]], but these views were opposed at the time by [[Marxists]] and [[social democrats]].{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Radical feminist and socialist [[Victoria Woodhull]] was expelled from the [[International Workingmen's Association]] in 1871 for her involvement in the free love and associated movements.<ref name=\"Yankee International\">Messer-Kruse, Timothy. 1998.

''The Grounding of Modern Feminism'', New Haven/London.</ref> and the \"[[The Fellowship of the New Life|New Life Socialism]]\" of [[Edward Carpenter]], [[Havelock Ellis]] and [[Olive Schreiner]]. Discussion groups organised by the Villagers were frequented by the Russian anarchist [[Emma Goldman]], among others. Magnus Hirschfeld noted in 1923 that Goldman \"has campaigned boldly and steadfastly for individual rights, and especially for those deprived of their rights. Thus it came about that she was the first and only woman, indeed the first and only American, to take up the defense of homosexual love before the general public.\"<ref>[[Jonathan Ned Katz|Katz, Jonathan Ned]]. ''[[Gay American History: Lesbians and Gay Men in the U.S.A.]]'' (New  York: Thomas Y.

During her life, Goldman was lionized as a free-thinking \"rebel woman\" by admirers, and derided by critics as an advocate of politically motivated murder and violent revolution. Her writing and lectures spanned a wide variety of issues, including prisons, atheism, freedom of speech, militarism, capitalism, marriage, free love, and homosexuality. Although she distanced herself from first-wave feminism and its efforts toward women's suffrage, she developed new ways of incorporating gender politics into anarchism. After decades of obscurity, Goldman's iconic status was revived in the 1970s, when feminist and anarchist scholars rekindled popular interest in her life.\n\n[[Mujeres Libres]] was an [[anarchism|anarchist]] women's organization in [[Spain]] that aimed to empower working-class women. It was founded in 1936 by [[Luc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez Saornil]], [[Mercedes Comaposada]] and [[Amparo Poch y Gasc\u00f3n]] and had approximately 30,000 members. The organization was based on the idea of a \"double struggle\" for [[Feminist movement|women's liberation]] and [[social revolution]] and argued that the two objectives were equally important and should be pursued in parallel. In order to gain mutual support, they created networks of women anarchists.

In this way, Luc\u00eda established herself as one of the most radical of voices among anarchist women, rejecting the ideal of female domesticity which remained largely unquestioned.

[[Emil Szittya]], in ''Das Kuriosit\u00e4ten-Kabinett'' (1923), wrote about homosexuality that \"very many anarchists have this tendency. Thus I found in Paris a Hungarian anarchist, [[Alexander Sommi]], who founded a homosexual anarchist group on the basis of this idea.\" His view is confirmed by [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] in his 1914 book ''Die Homosexualit\u00e4t des Mannes und des Weibes'': \"In the ranks of a relatively small party, the anarchist, it seemed to me as if proportionately more homosexuals and effeminates are found than in others.\" Italian anarchist [[Luigi Bertoni]] (who Szittya also believed to be gay) said that \"Anarchists demand freedom in everything, thus also in sexuality. Homosexuality leads to a healthy sense of egoism, for which every anarchist should strive.\"<ref>[[Magnus Hirschfeld|Hirschfeld, Magnus]], 1914.

Brand and his colleagues, known as the [[Gemeinschaft der Eigenen]], were heavily influenced by homosexual anarchist [[John Henry Mackay]]. The group despised effeminacy and saw homosexuality as an expression of manly virility available to all men, espousing a form of nationalistic masculine ''Lieblingminne'' (chivalric love) that would later be linked to the rise of [[Nazism]]. They were opposed to Hirschfeld's medical characterisation of homosexuality as the domain of an \"intermediate sex\". Brand \"toyed with anti-Semitism\",<ref>Mosse, George L.

[[Ewald Tschek]], another gay anarchist writer of the era, regularly contributed to Adolf Brand's journal ''Der Eigene'', and wrote in 1925 that Hirschfeld's Scientific Humanitarian Committee was a danger to the German people, caricaturing Hirschfeld as \"Dr. Feldhirsch\".\n\n===Anarchist homophobia===\nWhilst these prohomosexual stances had begun to surface; many members of the anarchist movement of the time still believed that nature/a divine Creator had provided a perfect answer to human relationships; an editorial in an influential Spanish anarchist journal from 1935 argued that an Anarchist must even avoid any relationship with homosexuals: \"If you are an anarchist, that means that you are more morally upright and physically strong than the average man.

A number of homosexual rights groups came into being during this period. These groups, now known as the \"[[homophile]]\" movement, often had left-wing or socialist politics, such as the communist [[Mattachine Society]] and the Dutch [[COC Nederland|COC]] which originated on the left.<ref>On Mattahine's left beginnings, see: John D'Emilio, ''Sexual Politics, Sexual Communities: The Making of a Homosexual Minority in the United States, 1940-1970''.

In 1934, he organised an important 83-day-long workers' strike of the port of [[San Francisco]] with his lover, actor [[Will Geer]]. He was an active member of the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]]. Hay and the Mattachine Society were among the first to argue that gay people were not just individuals but in fact represented a \"cultural minority\". They even called for public marches of homosexuals, predicting later gay pride parades. Hay's concept of the \"cultural minority\" came directly from his Marxist studies, and the rhetoric that he and his colleague Charles Rowland employed often reflected the militant Communist tradition. The Communist Party did not officially allow gays to be members, claiming that homosexuality was a 'deviation'; perhaps more important was the fear that a member's (usually secret) homosexuality would leave them open to blackmail and made them a security risk in an era of red-baiting. Concerned to save the party difficulties, as he put more energy into the Mattachine Society, Hay himself approached the CP's leaders and recommended his own expulsion.

Originally charged with vagrancy and lewd conduct, he pleaded guilty to a single, lesser charge of \"sex perversion\" (as [[sodomy|consensual sodomy]] was officially referred to in California then) and served 60 days in jail. This was the first time that his homosexuality had come to public attention. He had been and remained candid about his sexuality, although homosexuality was still criminalized throughout the United States. In 1957, Rustin and [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] began organizing the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC). Many African-American leaders were concerned that Rustin's sexual orientation and past Communist membership would undermine support for the civil rights movement. [[U.S. Representative]] [[Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.]], who was a member of the SCLC's board, forced Rustin's resignation from the SCLC in 1960 by threatening to discuss Rustin's morals charge in Congress.<ref>Lewis, David L.

In 1933 the Soviet government, under Stalin, recriminalised homosexuality. On March 7, 1934, Article 121 was added to the criminal code, for the entire Soviet Union, that expressly prohibited only male homosexuality, with up to five years of hard labor in prison. There were no criminal statutes regarding lesbianism.\n\nThe lowest point in the history of the relationship between socialism and homosexuality begins with the rise of [[Joseph Stalin]] in the USSR, after Lenin's death, and continues through the era of state socialism in the [[Soviet Union]], [[East Germany]], [[China]] and [[North Korea]]. In all cases the conditions of sexual minorities, including transgender people, worsened in communist states after the arrival of Stalin. Hundreds of thousands of homosexuals were interned in [[gulag]]s during the [[Great Purge]], where many were beaten to death.

Some states (such as the early Soviet Union prior to 1929-1933) practiced as degree of toleration. Others maintained negative policies towards homosexuals throughout their history, or gradually evolved to positions of relative toleration or official ignorance after the 1960s (East Germany, the USSR, etc.) In less tolerant periods effeminate men and homosexuals were sometimes forced to participate in programs of 'reeducation' involving [[forced labor]], [[conversion therapy]], [[Psychiatric medication|psychotropic drugs]] or confinement in [[psychiatric hospital]]s.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nThe revolutionary Cuban gay writer [[Reinaldo Arenas]] noted that, shortly after the communist government of [[Fidel Castro]] came to power, \"persecution began and [[concentration camps]] [[Military Units to Aid Production|were opened]] [...] the sexual act became taboo while the \"new man\" was proclaimed and masculinity exalted.\"<ref>[[Reinaldo Arenas|Arenas, Reinaldo]]</ref> Homosexuality was legalized in Cuba in 1979.<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-11147157|title=Fidel Castro takes blame for persecution of Cuban gays|publisher=|accessdate=6 July 2016}}</ref> Fidel Castro apologized for Cuba's poor historical record on LGBT issues in 2010.<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\"/>\n\nWhile there had been no law against sodomy in the USSR, such a law was introduced in 1933, added to the penal code as Article 121, which condemned homosexual relations with penalties of imprisonment up to five years.

He was a leading figure in the French Left from the 1930s until his death in 1988. After [[coming out]] in 1965, he spoke about the extreme hostility toward homosexuality that permeated the left throughout much of the 20th century.<ref>*The [[Parti Communiste Fran\u00e7ais]] was \"hysterically intransigent as far as \u2019moral behaviour\u2019 was concerned\" (''Aragon, victime et profiteur du tabou'', in ''Gai Pied Hebdo'', 4 June 1983, reproduced in ''Homosexualit\u00e9 et R\u00e9volution'', pp. 62-3, quote p. 63.);<br />* The trotskyist [[Pierre Lambert]]'s OCI was \"completely hysterical with regard to homosexuality\"; [[Workers' Struggle|Lutte ouvrire]] was theoretically opposed to homosexuality; as was the [[Communist League|Ligue communiste]], despite their belatedly paying lip service to gay lib.

Their attitude was \"the most blinkered, the most reactionary, the most antiscientific\". (''Etre homosexuel et r\u00e9volutionnaire'', La Quinzaine litt\u00e9raire, no. 215, no. sp\u00e9cial : \u2018Les homosexualit\u00e9s\u2019 (August 1975), pp. 9-10.

They are now often described with the phrase [[utopian socialism]]. Gender and sexuality were significant concerns for many of the leading thinkers, such as [[Charles Fourier]] and [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, Comte de Saint-Simon|Henri de Saint-Simon]] in France and [[Robert Owen]] in Britain, as well as their followers, many of whom were women. For Fourier, for example, true freedom could only occur without masters, without the ethos of work, and without suppressing passions; the suppression of passions is not only destructive to the individual, but to society as a whole. Writing before the advent of the term 'homosexuality', Fourier recognised that both men and women have a wide range of sexual needs and preferences which may change throughout their lives, including same-sex sexuality and ''androg\u00e9nit\u00e9''. He argued that all sexual expressions should be enjoyed as long as people are not abused, and that \"affirming one's difference\" can actually enhance social integration.<ref>[[Charles Fourier]], ''Le Nouveau Monde amoureux'' (written 1816-18, not published widely until 1967: Paris: \u00c9ditions Anthropos). pp. 389, 391, 429, 458, 459, 462, and 463.</ref>\n\n===Germany===\n[[File:Jean Baptista von Schweizer, ADA president.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Jean Baptista von Schweitzer]], German socialist arrested on a homosexual charge in 1862.]]\nFrom the earliest European homosexual rights movements, activists such as [[Karl-Heinrich Ulrichs]] and [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] approached the Left for support. During the 1860s, Ulrichs wrote to [[Karl Marx]] and sent him a number of books on [[Uranian]] (homosexual/transgender) emancipation, and in 1869 Marx passed one of Ulrich's books on to Engels.<ref>Most of the information on this incident is taken from: Kennedy, Hubert, ''Johann Baptist von Schweitzer: The Queer Marx Loved to Hate''.

Hirschfeld, who was also a socialist and supporter of the [[First-wave feminism|Women's Movement]], formed the [[Scientific-Humanitarian Committee]] to campaign against [[Paragraph 175|German Penal Code Section 175]] which outlawed male-male sex. Hirschfeld's organisation did a deal with the SPD (of which Lassalle and Schweitzer had been members) to get them to put forward a bill in the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]] in 1898, but it was opposed in the Reichstag and failed to pass. Most of Hirschfeld's circle of homosexual activists had socialist politics, including [[Kurt Hiller]], [[Richard Linsert]], [[Johanna Elberskirchen]] and [[Bruno Vogel]]. After the toppling of the German monarchy, the struggle against \u00a7 175 was continued by some social democrats. The German Minister of Justice Gustav Radbruch, member of the Social Democratic Party, tried to erase the paragraphe from the German penal law.

The 1890s saw Carpenter in a concerted effort to campaign against discrimination on the grounds of [[sexual orientation]]. He strongly believed that same-sex attraction was a natural orientation for people of a [[Third gender|third sex]]. His 1908 book on the subject, ''[[The Intermediate Sex]]'', would become a foundational text of the [[LGBT movements]] of the 20th century. ''The Intermediate Sex: A Study of Some Transitional Types of Men and Women'' expressed his views on homosexuality. Carpenter argues that \"uranism\", as he terms homosexuality, was on the increase marking a new age of sexual liberation.<ref>Flood, M. (2007) International Encyclopedia of Men and Masculinities, Routledge: Abingdon, p. 315</ref> He continued to work in the early part of the 20th century composing works on the \"Homogenic question\".

Some of the topics addressed in lecture and publication by the society included: the promotion of the scientific study of sex; a more rational attitude towards sexual conduct and problems and questions connected with sexual psychology (from medical, juridical, and sociological aspects), birth control, abortion, sterilization, venereal diseases, and all aspects of prostitution.\n\n==Anarchism, libertarian socialism and LGBT rights==\n{{Main|Anarcho-queer}}\nIn Europe and North America, the [[free love movement]] combined ideas revived from utopian socialism with anarchism and [[feminism]] to attack the \"hypocritical\" [[Victorian morality|sexual morality of the Victorian era]], and the institutions of marriage and the family that were alleged to enslave women.

Magnus Hirschfeld noted in 1923 that Goldman \"has campaigned boldly and steadfastly for individual rights, and especially for those deprived of their rights.

During her life, Goldman was lionized as a free-thinking \"rebel woman\" by admirers, and derided by critics as an advocate of politically motivated murder and violent revolution. Her writing and lectures spanned a wide variety of issues, including prisons, atheism, freedom of speech, militarism, capitalism, marriage, free love, and homosexuality. Although she distanced herself from first-wave feminism and its efforts toward women's suffrage, she developed new ways of incorporating gender politics into anarchism. After decades of obscurity, Goldman's iconic status was revived in the 1970s, when feminist and anarchist scholars rekindled popular interest in her life.\n\n[[Mujeres Libres]] was an [[anarchism|anarchist]] women's organization in [[Spain]] that aimed to empower working-class women.

Brand and his colleagues, known as the [[Gemeinschaft der Eigenen]], were heavily influenced by homosexual anarchist [[John Henry Mackay]]. The group despised effeminacy and saw homosexuality as an expression of manly virility available to all men, espousing a form of nationalistic masculine ''Lieblingminne'' (chivalric love) that would later be linked to the rise of [[Nazism]]. They were opposed to Hirschfeld's medical characterisation of homosexuality as the domain of an \"intermediate sex\". Brand \"toyed with anti-Semitism\",<ref>Mosse, George L.

He was an active member of the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]]. Hay and the Mattachine Society were among the first to argue that gay people were not just individuals but in fact represented a \"cultural minority\". They even called for public marches of homosexuals, predicting later gay pride parades. Hay's concept of the \"cultural minority\" came directly from his Marxist studies, and the rhetoric that he and his colleague Charles Rowland employed often reflected the militant Communist tradition. The Communist Party did not officially allow gays to be members, claiming that homosexuality was a 'deviation'; perhaps more important was the fear that a member's (usually secret) homosexuality would leave them open to blackmail and made them a security risk in an era of red-baiting. Concerned to save the party difficulties, as he put more energy into the Mattachine Society, Hay himself approached the CP's leaders and recommended his own expulsion. However, after much soul-searching, the CP, clearly reeling at the loss of a respected member and theoretician of 18 years' standing, refused to expel Hay as a homosexual, instead expelling him under the more convenient ruse of 'security risk', while ostentatiously announcing him to be a 'Lifelong Friend of the People'.<ref name=\"workers\">{{citation |title=Harry Hay: Painful partings |first=Leslie |last=Feinberg |date=June 28, 2005 |accessdate=2007-11-01 |url=http://www.workers.org/2005/us/lavender-red-40/ |periodical=[[Workers World Party|Workers World]]}}</ref> The Mattachine Society was the second gay rights organization that Hay established, the first being '''Bachelors for Wallace'' (1948) in support of [[Henry A.

He had been and remained candid about his sexuality, although homosexuality was still criminalized throughout the United States.

Effectively the Soviet government decriminalised homosexuality in Russia and Ukraine after 1917. However other states in the USSR continued to ascribe legal punishments on sodomy.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=jACXalmJ3nEC& \"The Gay 100: A Ranking of the Most Influential Gay Men and Lesbians, Past and Present\"], Paul Russell.

In 1933 the Soviet government, under Stalin, recriminalised homosexuality. On March 7, 1934, Article 121 was added to the criminal code, for the entire Soviet Union, that expressly prohibited only male homosexuality, with up to five years of hard labor in prison. There were no criminal statutes regarding lesbianism.\n\nThe lowest point in the history of the relationship between socialism and homosexuality begins with the rise of [[Joseph Stalin]] in the USSR, after Lenin's death, and continues through the era of state socialism in the [[Soviet Union]], [[East Germany]], [[China]] and [[North Korea]]. In all cases the conditions of sexual minorities, including transgender people, worsened in communist states after the arrival of Stalin. Hundreds of thousands of homosexuals were interned in [[gulag]]s during the [[Great Purge]], where many were beaten to death. Some Western intellectuals withdrew their support of Communism after seeing the severity of repression in the USSR, including the gay writer [[Andr\u00e9 Gide]].<ref>Pollard, Patrick.

Some states (such as the early Soviet Union prior to 1929-1933) practiced as degree of toleration. Others maintained negative policies towards homosexuals throughout their history, or gradually evolved to positions of relative toleration or official ignorance after the 1960s (East Germany, the USSR, etc.) In less tolerant periods effeminate men and homosexuals were sometimes forced to participate in programs of 'reeducation' involving [[forced labor]], [[conversion therapy]], [[Psychiatric medication|psychotropic drugs]] or confinement in [[psychiatric hospital]]s.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nThe revolutionary Cuban gay writer [[Reinaldo Arenas]] noted that, shortly after the communist government of [[Fidel Castro]] came to power, \"persecution began and [[concentration camps]] [[Military Units to Aid Production|were opened]] [...] the sexual act became taboo while the \"new man\" was proclaimed and masculinity exalted.\"<ref>[[Reinaldo Arenas|Arenas, Reinaldo]]</ref> Homosexuality was legalized in Cuba in 1979.<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-11147157|title=Fidel Castro takes blame for persecution of Cuban gays|publisher=|accessdate=6 July 2016}}</ref> Fidel Castro apologized for Cuba's poor historical record on LGBT issues in 2010.<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\"/>\n\nWhile there had been no law against sodomy in the USSR, such a law was introduced in 1933, added to the penal code as Article 121, which condemned homosexual relations with penalties of imprisonment up to five years.

The writings of the French [[bisexual]] anarchist [[Daniel Gu\u00e9rin]] offer an insight into the tension sexual minorities among the Left have often felt. He was a leading figure in the French Left from the 1930s until his death in 1988. After [[coming out]] in 1965, he spoke about the extreme hostility toward homosexuality that permeated the left throughout much of the 20th century.<ref>*The [[Parti Communiste Fran\u00e7ais]] was \"hysterically intransigent as far as \u2019moral behaviour\u2019 was concerned\" (''Aragon, victime et profiteur du tabou'', in ''Gai Pied Hebdo'', 4 June 1983, reproduced in ''Homosexualit\u00e9 et R\u00e9volution'', pp. 62-3, quote p. 63.);<br />* The trotskyist [[Pierre Lambert]]'s OCI was \"completely hysterical with regard to homosexuality\"; [[Workers' Struggle|Lutte ouvrire]] was theoretically opposed to homosexuality; as was the [[Communist League|Ligue communiste]], despite their belatedly paying lip service to gay lib. (''\u00e0 confesse'', Interview with G\u00e9rard Ponthieu in Sexpol no. 1 (20 January 1975), pp.10-14.)<br />* Together, Gu\u00e9rin argued, such groups bore a great deal of responsibility for fostering homophobic attitudes among the working class as late as the 1970s. Their attitude was \"the most blinkered, the most reactionary, the most antiscientific\". (''Etre homosexuel et r\u00e9volutionnaire'', La Quinzaine litt\u00e9raire, no. 215, no. sp\u00e9cial : \u2018Les homosexualit\u00e9s\u2019 (August 1975), pp. 9-10.

Gu\u00e9rin was involved in the uprising of May 1968, and was a part of the French Gay Liberation movement that emerged after the events. Decades later, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Martel described Gu\u00e9rin as the \"grandfather of the French homosexual movement.\"<ref>Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Martel, ''Le rose et le noir.

Some were inspired by [[Herbert Marcuse]]'s ''[[Eros and Civilization]]'', which attempts to synthesise the ideas of Karl Marx and [[Sigmund Freud]]. 1960s and 1970s radical [[Angela Davis]] (who officially came out as a lesbian in 1999) had studied under Marcuse and was greatly influenced by him.\nIn France, gay activist and political theorist [[Guy Hocquenghem]], like many others, developed a commitment to socialism through participating in the May 1968 insurrection. A former member of the [[French Communist Party]], he later joined the [[Front Homosexuel d'Action R\u00e9volutionnaire]] (FHAR), formed by radical lesbians who split from the [[Mouvement Homophile de France]] in 1971, including the left [[ecofeminism|ecofeminist]] [[Fran\u00e7oise d'Eaubonne]]. That same year, the FHAR became the first homosexual group to demonstrate publicly in France when they joined Paris's annual [[May Day]] march held by trade unions and left-wing parties.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the 1980s saw increased [[opposition to LGBT rights]] from the right wing [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government led by [[Margaret Thatcher]], who introduced [[Section 28]] in 1988 in order to prevent what they saw as the \"promotion\" of homosexuality as an acceptable lifestyle in schools. However, the Conservatives' main opposition, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], did little to address the issue of LGBT rights, ignoring calls from left-wingers such as [[Ken Livingstone]], to do so.<ref>Turner, Alwyn W.

Initially in medieval Latin European documents, a land grant in exchange for service was called a ''beneficium'' (Latin).<ref name=lubetski>Meir Lubetski (ed.).

''Feudalism'', 1961, pg. 106.</ref> Kern derived the word from a putative Frankish term ''*fehu-\u00f4d'', in which ''*fehu'' means \"cattle\" and ''-\u00f4d'' means \"goods\", implying \"a moveable object of value\".<ref name=bloch-ety1/><ref name=bloch-ety2/> Bloch explains that by the beginning of the 10th century it was common to value land in monetary terms but to pay for it with moveable objects of equivalent value, such as arms, clothing, horses or food. This was known as ''feos'', a term that took on the general meaning of paying for something in lieu of money. This meaning was then applied to land itself, in which land was used to pay for fealty, such as to a vassal. Thus the old word ''feos'' meaning movable property changed little by little to ''feus'' meaning the exact opposite: landed property.<ref name=bloch-ety1/><ref name=bloch-ety2/>\n\nAnother theory was put forward by [[Archibald R. Lewis]].<ref name=lubetski/> Lewis said the origin of 'fief' is not ''feudum'' (or ''feodum''), but rather ''foderum'', the earliest attested use being in [[Astronomus]]'s ''[[Vita Hludovici]]'' (840).<ref name=arlewis>[[Archibald R. Lewis]]. ''The Development of Southern French and Catalan Society 718\u20131050'', 1965, pp. 76\u201377.</ref> In that text is a passage about [[Louis the Pious]] that says ''annona militaris quas vulgo foderum vocant'', which can be translated as \"Louis forbade that military [[provender]] (which they popularly call \"fodder\") be furnished..\"<ref name=lubetski/>\n\nAnother theory by [[Alauddin Samarrai]] suggests an Arabic origin, from ''fuy\u016b'' (the plural of ''fay'', which literally means \"the returned\", and was used especially for 'land that has been conquered from enemies that did not fight').<ref name=lubetski/><ref name=samarrai>[[Alauddin Samarrai]]. \"The term 'fief': A possible Arabic origin\", ''Studies in Medieval Culture'', 4.1 (1973), pp. 78\u201382.</ref> Samarrai's theory is that early forms of 'fief' include ''feo'', ''feu'', ''feuz'', ''feuum'' and others, the plurality of forms strongly suggesting origins from a [[loanword]]. The first use of these terms is in [[Languedoc]], one of the least Germanic areas of Europe and bordering Muslim Spain. Further, the earliest use of ''feuum'' (as a replacement for ''beneficium'') can be dated to 899, the same year a Muslim base at [[Fraxinetum]] ([[La Garde-Freinet]]) in [[Provence]] was established. It is possible, Samarrai says, that French scribes, writing in Latin, attempted to [[Transliteration|transliterate]] the Arabic word ''fuy\u016b'' (the plural of ''fay''), which was being used by the Muslim invaders and occupiers at the time, resulting in a plurality of forms \u2013 ''feo, feu, feuz, feuum'' and others \u2013 from which eventually ''feudum'' derived. Samarrai, however, also advises to handle this theory with care, as Medieval and Early Modern Muslim scribes often used etymologically \"fanciful roots\" in order to claim the most outlandish things to be of Arabian or Muslim origin.<ref name=samarrai/>\n\n==History==\nFeudalism, in its various forms, usually emerged as a result of the [[decentralization]] of an empire: especially in the [[Carolingian Empire]] in 8th century AD/CE, which lacked the bureaucratic infrastructure{{clarify|date=September 2012}} necessary to support [[cavalry]] without allocating land to these mounted troops. Mounted soldiers began to secure a system of hereditary rule over their allocated land and their power over the territory came to encompass the social, political, judicial, and economic spheres.<ref name=\"Gat, Azar 2006. pp. 332\">Gat, Azar. War in Human Civilization, New York: Oxford University Press, 2006. pp. 332\u2013343</ref>\n\nThese acquired powers significantly [[federation|diminished unitary power]] in these empires. Only when the infrastructure existed to maintain unitary power\u2014as with the European monarchies\u2014did feudalism begin to yield to this new power structure and eventually disappear.<ref name=\"Gat, Azar 2006. pp. 332\"/>\n\n===Classic feudalism===\n{{See also|Feudalism in England|Feudalism in the Holy Roman Empire|Examples of feudalism}}\nThe classic [[Fran\u00e7ois-Louis Ganshof]] version of feudalism<ref name=ebo/><ref name=ganshof/> describes a set of reciprocal legal and military obligations which existed among the warrior nobility, revolving around the three key concepts of [[lord]]s, [[vassal]]s and [[fief]]s. In broad terms a lord was a noble who held land, a vassal was a person who was granted possession of the land by the lord, and the land was known as a fief. In exchange for the use of the fief and protection by the lord, the vassal would provide some sort of service to the lord. There were many varieties of [[feudal land tenure]], consisting of  military and non-military service. The obligations and corresponding rights between lord and vassal concerning the fief form the basis of the feudal relationship.<ref name=ganshof/>\n\n===Vassalage===\n[[File:Hommage du comt\u00e9 de Clermont-en-Beauvaisis.png|thumbnail|[[Homage (feudal)|Homage]] of [[Clermont-en-Beauvaisis]]]]\nBefore a lord could grant land (a fief) to someone, he had to make that person a vassal. This was done at a formal and symbolic ceremony called a [[commendation ceremony]],  which was composed of the two-part act of [[Homage (medieval)|homage]] and oath of [[fealty]]. During homage, the lord and vassal entered into a contract in which the vassal promised to fight for the lord at his command, whilst the lord agreed to protect the vassal from external forces. ''Fealty'' comes from the Latin ''fidelitas'' and denotes the [[fidelity]] owed by a vassal to his feudal lord. \"Fealty\" also refers to an oath that more explicitly reinforces the commitments of the vassal made during homage. Such an oath follows homage.<ref name=stephenson>[https://www.scribd.com/doc/28860952/Mediavel-Feudalism ''Medieval Feudalism''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209083705/http://www.scribd.com/doc/28860952/Mediavel-Feudalism |date=2012-02-09 }}, by [[Carl Stephenson (historian)|Carl Stephenson]]. Cornell University Press, 1942. Classic introduction to Feudalism.</ref>\n\nOnce the commendation ceremony was complete, the lord and vassal were in a feudal relationship with agreed obligations to one another. The vassal's principal obligation to the lord was to \"aid\", or military service. Using whatever equipment the vassal could obtain by virtue of the revenues from the fief, the vassal was responsible to answer calls to military service on behalf of the lord. This security of military help was the primary reason the lord entered into the feudal relationship. In addition, the vassal could have other obligations to his lord, such as attendance at his court, whether manorial, baronial, both termed [[court baron]], or at the king's court.<ref>Encyc. Brit. op.cit. It was a standard part of the feudal contract (fief [land], fealty [oath of allegiance], faith [belief in God]) that every tenant was under an obligation to attend his overlord's court to advise and support him; [[Sir Harris Nicolas]], in ''Historic Peerage of England'', ed. [[William Courthope (officer of arms)|Courthope]], p.18, quoted by Encyc. Brit, op.cit., p. 388: \"It was the principle of the feudal system that every tenant should attend the court of his immediate superior\"</ref>\n\n[[File:Map France 1477-en.svg|thumb|France in the late 15th century: a mosaic of feudal territories]]\nIt could also involve the vassal providing \"counsel\", so that if the lord faced a major decision he would summon all his vassals and hold a council. At the level of the [[manor]] this might be a fairly mundane matter of agricultural policy, but also included sentencing by the lord for criminal offences, including capital punishment in some cases. Concerning the king's feudal court, such deliberation could include the question of declaring war. These are examples; depending on the period of time and location in Europe, feudal customs and practices varied; see [[examples of feudalism]].\n\n===The \"Feudal Revolution\" in France===\nIn its origin, the feudal grant of land had been seen in terms of a personal bond between lord and vassal, but with time and the transformation of fiefs into hereditary holdings, the nature of the system came to be seen as a form of \"politics of land\" (an expression used by the historian [[Marc Bloch]]).  The 11th century in France saw what has been called by historians a \"feudal revolution\" or \"mutation\" and a \"fragmentation of powers\" (Bloch) that was unlike the development of feudalism in England or Italy or Germany in the same period or later:<ref>Chris Wickham, ''The Inheritance of Rome'', p. 522-3.</ref> Counties and duchies began to break down into smaller holdings as [[castellan]]s and lesser seigneurs took control of local lands, and (as comital families had done before them) lesser lords usurped/privatized a wide range of prerogatives and rights of the state, most importantly the highly profitable rights of justice, but also travel dues, market dues, fees for using woodlands, obligations to use the lord's mill, etc.<ref name=\"auto1\">Wickham, ''The Inheritance of Rome'', p. 518.</ref> (what [[Georges Duby]] called collectively the \"''seigneurie banale''\"<ref name=\"auto1\"/>).  Power in this period became more personal.<ref>Wickham, ''The Inheritance of Rome'', p.522.</ref>\n\nThis \"fragmentation of powers\" was not, however, systematic throughout France, and in certain counties (such as Flanders, Normandy, Anjou, Toulouse), counts were able to maintain control of their lands into the 12th century or later.<ref>Wickham, p.523.</ref>  Thus, in some regions (like Normandy and Flanders), the vassal/feudal system was an effective tool for ducal and comital control, linking vassals to their lords; but in other regions, the system led to significant confusion, all the more so as vassals could and frequently did pledge themselves to two or more lords.  In response to this, the idea of a \"[[liege lord]]\" was developed (where the obligations to one lord are regarded as superior) in the 12th century.<ref>Elizabeth M. Hallam. ''Capetian France 987\u20131328'', p.17.</ref>\n\n===End of European feudalism (1500\u20131850s)===\n{{Further|Abolition of feudalism in France}}\n\nMost of the military aspects of feudalism effectively ended by about 1500.<ref>\"The End of Feudalism\" in J.H.M. Salmon, ''Society in Crisis: France in the Sixteenth Century'' (1979) pp 19\u201326</ref> This was partly since the military shifted from armies consisting of the nobility to professional fighters thus reducing the nobility's claim on power, but also because the [[Black Death]] reduced the nobility's hold over the lower classes. Vestiges of the feudal system hung on in France until the [[French Revolution]] of 1790's, and the system lingered on in parts of Central and Eastern Europe as late as the 1850s. [[Slavery in Romania]] was abolished in 1856. Russia finally abolished [[serfdom]] in 1861.<ref>John Merriman, ''A History of Modern Europe: From the Renaissance to the Age of Napoleon'' (1996) pp 12\u201313</ref><ref>Jerzy Topolski, Continuity and discontinuity in the development of the feudal system in Eastern Europe (Xth to XVIIth centuries)\" ''Journal of European Economic History'' (1981) 10#2 pp: 373\u2013400.</ref>\n\nEven when the original feudal relationships had disappeared, there were many institutional remnants of feudalism left in place. Historian [[Georges Lefebvre]] explains how at an early stage of the [[French Revolution]], on just one night of August 4, 1789, France abolished the long-lasting remnants of the feudal order. It announced, \"The National Assembly abolishes the feudal system entirely.\" Lefebvre explains:\n\n{{quote|Without debate the Assembly enthusiastically adopted equality of taxation and redemption of all manorial rights except for those involving personal servitude\u2014which were to be abolished without indemnification. Other proposals followed with the same success: the equality of legal punishment, admission of all to public office, abolition of venality in office, conversion of the tithe into payments subject to redemption, freedom of worship, prohibition of plural holding of benefices&nbsp;...

Tr. L.A. Manyon. Two volume. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1961 {{ISBN|0-226-05979-0}}</ref> offers a wider definition than Ganshof's and includes within the feudal structure not only the warrior aristocracy bound by vassalage, but also the [[peasant]]ry bound by manorialism, and the estates of the Church. Thus the feudal order embraces society from top to bottom, though the \"powerful and well-differentiated social group of the urban classes\" came to occupy a distinct position to some extent outside the classic feudal hierarchy.\n\n==Historiography==\nThe idea of ''feudalism'' was unknown and the system it describes was not conceived of as a formal political system by the people living in the Medieval Period. This section describes the history of the idea of feudalism, how the concept originated among scholars and thinkers, how it changed over time, and modern debates about its use.\n\n===Evolution of the concept===\n{{English Feudalism}}\nThe concept of a feudal state or period, in the sense of either a regime or a period dominated by lords who possess financial or social power and prestige, became widely held in the middle of the 18th century, as a result of works such as [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu's]] ''De L'Esprit des Lois'' (1748; published in English as ''[[The Spirit of the Laws]]''), and [[Henri de Boulainvilliers]]\u2019s ''Histoire des anciens Parlements de France'' (1737; published in English as ''An Historical Account of the Ancient Parliaments of France or States-General of the Kingdom'', 1739).<ref name=cheyette/> In the 18th century, writers of the Enlightenment wrote about feudalism to denigrate the antiquated system of the ''[[Ancien R\u00e9gime]]'', or French monarchy. This was the [[Age of Enlightenment]] when writers valued reason and the Middle Ages were viewed as the \"[[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]\". Enlightenment authors generally mocked and ridiculed anything from the \"Dark Ages\" including feudalism, projecting its negative characteristics on the current French monarchy as a means of political gain.<ref name=bartlett>[[Robert Bartlett (historian)|Robert Bartlett]]. \"Perspectives on the Medieval World\" in ''Medieval Panorama'', 2001, {{ISBN|0-89236-642-7}}</ref> For them \"feudalism\" meant [[Fiefdom|seigneurial]] privileges and prerogatives. When the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|French Constituent Assembly]] abolished the \"feudal regime\" in August 1789 this is what was meant.\n\n[[Adam Smith]] used the term \"feudal system\" to describe a social and economic system defined by inherited social ranks, each of which possessed inherent social and economic privileges and obligations. In such a system wealth derived from agriculture, which was arranged not according to market forces but on the basis of customary labour services owed by [[serf]]s to landowning nobles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usna.edu/Users/history/abels/hh315/Feudal.htm |title=Feudalism |author=Richard Abels |date= |work= |publisher=usna.edu |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\n===Karl Marx===\n[[Karl Marx]] also used the term in the 19th century in his analysis of society's economic and political development, describing feudalism (or more usually feudal society or the feudal [[mode of production]]) as the order coming before [[capitalism]]. For Marx, what defined feudalism was the power of the ruling class (the [[aristocracy]]) in their control of arable land, leading to a [[class society]] based upon the exploitation of the peasants who farm these lands, typically under [[serfdom]] and principally by means of labour, produce and money rents.<ref name=daileader/> Marx thus defined feudalism primarily by its economic characteristics.\n\nHe also took it as a paradigm for understanding the power-relationships between capitalists and wage-labourers in his own time: \"in pre-capitalist systems it was obvious that most people did not control their own destiny\u2014under feudalism, for instance, serfs had to work for their lords. Capitalism seems different because people are in theory free to work for themselves or for others as they choose. Yet most workers have as little control over their lives as feudal serfs.\"<ref>Peter Singer, ''Marx: A Very Short Introduction'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000) [first published 1980], p. 91.</ref> Some later Marxist theorists (e.g. [[Eric Wolf]]) have applied this label to include non-European societies, grouping feudalism together with Imperial Chinese and pre-Columbian Incan societies as 'tributary'.\n\n===Later studies===\n{{Feudal status}}\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, [[John Horace Round]] and [[Frederic William Maitland]], both historians of medieval Britain, arrived at different conclusions as to the character of English society before the [[Norman Conquest]] in 1066. Round argued that the Normans had brought feudalism with them to England, while Maitland contended that its fundamentals were already in place in Britain before 1066. The debate continues today, but a consensus viewpoint is that England before the Conquest had commendation (which embodied some of the personal elements in feudalism) while [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]] introduced a modified and stricter northern French feudalism to England incorporating (1086) oaths of loyalty to the king by all who held by feudal tenure, even the vassals of his principal vassals (holding by feudal tenure meant that vassals must provide the quota of knights required by the king or a money payment in substitution).\n\nIn the 20th century, two outstanding historians offered still more widely differing perspectives. The French historian [[Marc Bloch]], arguably the most influential 20th-century medieval historian,<ref name=daileader/> approached feudalism not so much from a legal and military point of view but from a sociological one, presenting in ''Feudal Society'' (1939; English 1961) a feudal order not limited solely to the nobility. It is his radical notion that peasants were part of the feudal relationship that sets Bloch apart from his peers: while the vassal performed military service in exchange for the fief, the peasant performed physical labour in return for protection \u2013 both are a form of feudal relationship. According to Bloch, other elements of society can be seen in feudal terms; all the aspects of life were centered on \"lordship\", and so we can speak usefully of a feudal church structure, a feudal courtly (and anti-courtly) literature, and a feudal economy.<ref name=daileader/>\n\nIn contradistinction to Bloch, the Belgian historian [[Fran\u00e7ois-Louis Ganshof]] defined feudalism from a narrow legal and military perspective, arguing that feudal relationships existed only within the medieval nobility itself. Ganshof articulated this concept in ''Qu'est-ce que la f\u00e9odalit\u00e9?'' (\"What is feudalism?\", 1944; translated in English as ''Feudalism''). His classic definition of feudalism is widely accepted today among medieval scholars,<ref name=daileader>[[Philip Daileader]], \"Feudalism\", ''The High Middle Ages'', Course No. 869, [[The Teaching Company]], {{ISBN|1-56585-827-1}}</ref> though questioned both by those who view the concept in wider terms and by those who find insufficient uniformity in noble exchanges to support such a model.\n\nAlthough he was never formally a student in the circle of scholars around Marc Bloch and [[Lucien Febvre]] that came to be known as the [[Annales School]], [[Georges Duby]] was an exponent of the ''Annaliste'' tradition. In  a published version of his 1952 doctoral thesis entitled ''La soci\u00e9t\u00e9 aux XIe et XIIe si\u00e8cles dans la r\u00e9gion m\u00e2connaise'' (''Society in the 11th and 12th centuries in the [[M\u00e2connais]] region''), and working from the extensive documentary sources surviving from the Burgundian [[Cluny Abbey|monastery of Cluny]], as well as the dioceses of [[Ancient Diocese of M\u00e2con|M\u00e2con]] and [[Dijon]], Duby excavated the complex social and economic relationships among the individuals and institutions of the [[M\u00e2connais]] region and charted a profound shift in the social structures of medieval society around the year 1000. He argued that in early 11th century, governing institutions\u2014particularly comital courts established under the [[Carolingian]] monarchy\u2014that had represented public justice and order in Burgundy during the 9th and 10th centuries receded and gave way to a new feudal order wherein independent aristocratic knights wielded power over peasant communities through strong-arm tactics and threats of violence.\n\nIn 1939 the Austrian historian {{ill|Theodor Mayer|de|Theodor Mayer (Historiker)}} subordinated the feudal state as secondary to his concept of a persons association state (''{{ill|Personenverbandsstaat|de|Personenverbandsstaat}}''), understanding it in contrast to the [[territorial state]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Companion to Historiography |first=Michael |last=Bentley |date=2006 |publisher=Routledge |access-date=2019-11-17 |page=126 |url=https://books.google.at/books?id=JWqIAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA126&lpg=PA126&dq=personenverbandsstaat+english&source=bl&ots=v7irDNs7Vb&sig=ACfU3U0IEV0KpSOCC4h8pWqPYmnZWLionQ&hl=de&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjC1-K4o-_lAhVHY1AKHYweAb44ChDoATAHegQICBAB#v=onepage&q=personenverbandsstaat&f=false}}</ref> This form of statehood, identified with the [[Feudalism in the Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Empire]], is described as the most complete form of medieval rule, completing conventional feudal structure of lordship and vassalage with the personal association between the nobility.<ref>{{cite book |title=Covenant and commonwealth : from Christian separation through the Protestant Reformation |volume=Volume 2 |first=Daniel Judah |last=Elazar |date=1996 |publisher=Transaction Publishers |access-date=2019-11-17 |page=76 |url=https://books.google.at/books?id=yKOIqPsf7acC&pg=PA381&lpg=PA381&dq=personenverbandsstaat+english&source=bl&ots=MWhCh0jASY&sig=ACfU3U3s47Wb-vPFRJptf72zGORr9N7hYw&hl=de&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjC1-K4o-_lAhVHY1AKHYweAb44ChDoATAGegQICRAB#v=onepage&q=personenverbandsstaat&f=false}}</ref>\u00a0 But the applicability of this concept to cases outside of the Holy Roman Empire has been questioned, as by Susan Reynolds.<ref>{{cite book |title=Fiefs and Vassals: The Medieval Evidence Reinterpreted |first=Susan |last=Raynolds |date=1996 |publisher=Oxford University Press |access-date=2019-11-17 |page=397 |url=https://books.google.at/books?id=vkQ8z7S2cIIC&pg=PA397&lpg=PA397&dq=personenverbandsstaat+english&source=bl&ots=dEGQY6D7fT&sig=ACfU3U3oHYi2118XOe_lFWxaP3DCNRQWjQ&hl=de&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjC1-K4\u00fco-_lAhVHY1AKHYweAb44ChDoATAEegQIBxAB#v=onepage&q=personenverbandsstaat&f=false}}</ref> The concept has also been questioned and superseded in German histography because of its bias and reductionism towards legitimating the [[F\u00fchrerprinzip]].\n\n===Challenges to the feudal model===\nIn 1974, U.S. historian [[Elizabeth A.

Having noted the current use of many, often contradictory, definitions of ''feudalism'', she argued that the word is only a construct with no basis in medieval reality, an invention of modern historians read back \"tyrannically\" into the historical record. Supporters of Brown have suggested that the term should be expunged from history textbooks and lectures on medieval history entirely.<ref name=daileader/> In ''Fiefs and Vassals: The Medieval Evidence Reinterpreted'' (1994),<ref name=reynolds>Reynolds, Susan, ''Fiefs and Vassals: The Medieval Evidence Reinterpreted.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1994 {{ISBN|0-19-820648-8}}</ref> [[Susan Reynolds]] expanded upon Brown's original thesis. Although some contemporaries questioned Reynolds's methodology, other historians have supported it and her argument.<ref name=daileader/> Reynolds argues:\n:Too many models of feudalism used for comparisons, even by Marxists, are still either constructed on the 16th-century basis or incorporate what, in a Marxist view, must surely be superficial or irrelevant features from it.  Even when one restricts oneself to Europe and to feudalism in its narrow sense it is extremely doubtful whether feudo-vassalic institutions formed a coherent bundle of institutions or concepts that were structurally separate from other  institutions  and concepts of the time.<ref>Reynolds, p 11</ref>\n\nThe term ''feudal'' has also been applied to non-Western societies in which institutions and attitudes similar to those of medieval Europe are perceived to have prevailed (See [[Examples of feudalism]]).

The etymology of ''feodum'' is complex with multiple theories, some suggesting a Germanic origin (the most widely held view) and others suggesting an [[Arabic]] origin. Initially in medieval Latin European documents, a land grant in exchange for service was called a ''beneficium'' (Latin).<ref name=lubetski>Meir Lubetski (ed.).

''Feudalism'', 1961, pg. 106.</ref> Kern derived the word from a putative Frankish term ''*fehu-\u00f4d'', in which ''*fehu'' means \"cattle\" and ''-\u00f4d'' means \"goods\", implying \"a moveable object of value\".<ref name=bloch-ety1/><ref name=bloch-ety2/> Bloch explains that by the beginning of the 10th century it was common to value land in monetary terms but to pay for it with moveable objects of equivalent value, such as arms, clothing, horses or food. This was known as ''feos'', a term that took on the general meaning of paying for something in lieu of money. This meaning was then applied to land itself, in which land was used to pay for fealty, such as to a vassal. Thus the old word ''feos'' meaning movable property changed little by little to ''feus'' meaning the exact opposite: landed property.<ref name=bloch-ety1/><ref name=bloch-ety2/>\n\nAnother theory was put forward by [[Archibald R. Lewis]].<ref name=lubetski/> Lewis said the origin of 'fief' is not ''feudum'' (or ''feodum''), but rather ''foderum'', the earliest attested use being in [[Astronomus]]'s ''[[Vita Hludovici]]'' (840).<ref name=arlewis>[[Archibald R. Lewis]]. ''The Development of Southern French and Catalan Society 718\u20131050'', 1965, pp. 76\u201377.</ref> In that text is a passage about [[Louis the Pious]] that says ''annona militaris quas vulgo foderum vocant'', which can be translated as \"Louis forbade that military [[provender]] (which they popularly call \"fodder\") be furnished..\"<ref name=lubetski/>\n\nAnother theory by [[Alauddin Samarrai]] suggests an Arabic origin, from ''fuy\u016b'' (the plural of ''fay'', which literally means \"the returned\", and was used especially for 'land that has been conquered from enemies that did not fight').<ref name=lubetski/><ref name=samarrai>[[Alauddin Samarrai]]. \"The term 'fief': A possible Arabic origin\", ''Studies in Medieval Culture'', 4.1 (1973), pp. 78\u201382.</ref> Samarrai's theory is that early forms of 'fief' include ''feo'', ''feu'', ''feuz'', ''feuum'' and others, the plurality of forms strongly suggesting origins from a [[loanword]]. The first use of these terms is in [[Languedoc]], one of the least Germanic areas of Europe and bordering Muslim Spain. Further, the earliest use of ''feuum'' (as a replacement for ''beneficium'') can be dated to 899, the same year a Muslim base at [[Fraxinetum]] ([[La Garde-Freinet]]) in [[Provence]] was established. It is possible, Samarrai says, that French scribes, writing in Latin, attempted to [[Transliteration|transliterate]] the Arabic word ''fuy\u016b'' (the plural of ''fay''), which was being used by the Muslim invaders and occupiers at the time, resulting in a plurality of forms \u2013 ''feo, feu, feuz, feuum'' and others \u2013 from which eventually ''feudum'' derived. Samarrai, however, also advises to handle this theory with care, as Medieval and Early Modern Muslim scribes often used etymologically \"fanciful roots\" in order to claim the most outlandish things to be of Arabian or Muslim origin.<ref name=samarrai/>\n\n==History==\nFeudalism, in its various forms, usually emerged as a result of the [[decentralization]] of an empire: especially in the [[Carolingian Empire]] in 8th century AD/CE, which lacked the bureaucratic infrastructure{{clarify|date=September 2012}} necessary to support [[cavalry]] without allocating land to these mounted troops. Mounted soldiers began to secure a system of hereditary rule over their allocated land and their power over the territory came to encompass the social, political, judicial, and economic spheres.<ref name=\"Gat, Azar 2006. pp. 332\">Gat, Azar. War in Human Civilization, New York: Oxford University Press, 2006. pp. 332\u2013343</ref>\n\nThese acquired powers significantly [[federation|diminished unitary power]] in these empires. Only when the infrastructure existed to maintain unitary power\u2014as with the European monarchies\u2014did feudalism begin to yield to this new power structure and eventually disappear.<ref name=\"Gat, Azar 2006. pp. 332\"/>\n\n===Classic feudalism===\n{{See also|Feudalism in England|Feudalism in the Holy Roman Empire|Examples of feudalism}}\nThe classic [[Fran\u00e7ois-Louis Ganshof]] version of feudalism<ref name=ebo/><ref name=ganshof/> describes a set of reciprocal legal and military obligations which existed among the warrior nobility, revolving around the three key concepts of [[lord]]s, [[vassal]]s and [[fief]]s. In broad terms a lord was a noble who held land, a vassal was a person who was granted possession of the land by the lord, and the land was known as a fief. In exchange for the use of the fief and protection by the lord, the vassal would provide some sort of service to the lord. There were many varieties of [[feudal land tenure]], consisting of  military and non-military service. The obligations and corresponding rights between lord and vassal concerning the fief form the basis of the feudal relationship.<ref name=ganshof/>\n\n===Vassalage===\n[[File:Hommage du comt\u00e9 de Clermont-en-Beauvaisis.png|thumbnail|[[Homage (feudal)|Homage]] of [[Clermont-en-Beauvaisis]]]]\nBefore a lord could grant land (a fief) to someone, he had to make that person a vassal. This was done at a formal and symbolic ceremony called a [[commendation ceremony]],  which was composed of the two-part act of [[Homage (medieval)|homage]] and oath of [[fealty]]. During homage, the lord and vassal entered into a contract in which the vassal promised to fight for the lord at his command, whilst the lord agreed to protect the vassal from external forces. ''Fealty'' comes from the Latin ''fidelitas'' and denotes the [[fidelity]] owed by a vassal to his feudal lord. \"Fealty\" also refers to an oath that more explicitly reinforces the commitments of the vassal made during homage. Such an oath follows homage.<ref name=stephenson>[https://www.scribd.com/doc/28860952/Mediavel-Feudalism ''Medieval Feudalism''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209083705/http://www.scribd.com/doc/28860952/Mediavel-Feudalism |date=2012-02-09 }}, by [[Carl Stephenson (historian)|Carl Stephenson]]. Cornell University Press, 1942. Classic introduction to Feudalism.</ref>\n\nOnce the commendation ceremony was complete, the lord and vassal were in a feudal relationship with agreed obligations to one another. The vassal's principal obligation to the lord was to \"aid\", or military service. Using whatever equipment the vassal could obtain by virtue of the revenues from the fief, the vassal was responsible to answer calls to military service on behalf of the lord. This security of military help was the primary reason the lord entered into the feudal relationship. In addition, the vassal could have other obligations to his lord, such as attendance at his court, whether manorial, baronial, both termed [[court baron]], or at the king's court.<ref>Encyc. Brit. op.cit. It was a standard part of the feudal contract (fief [land], fealty [oath of allegiance], faith [belief in God]) that every tenant was under an obligation to attend his overlord's court to advise and support him; [[Sir Harris Nicolas]], in ''Historic Peerage of England'', ed. [[William Courthope (officer of arms)|Courthope]], p.18, quoted by Encyc. Brit, op.cit., p. 388: \"It was the principle of the feudal system that every tenant should attend the court of his immediate superior\"</ref>\n\n[[File:Map France 1477-en.svg|thumb|France in the late 15th century: a mosaic of feudal territories]]\nIt could also involve the vassal providing \"counsel\", so that if the lord faced a major decision he would summon all his vassals and hold a council. At the level of the [[manor]] this might be a fairly mundane matter of agricultural policy, but also included sentencing by the lord for criminal offences, including capital punishment in some cases. Concerning the king's feudal court, such deliberation could include the question of declaring war. These are examples; depending on the period of time and location in Europe, feudal customs and practices varied; see [[examples of feudalism]].\n\n===The \"Feudal Revolution\" in France===\nIn its origin, the feudal grant of land had been seen in terms of a personal bond between lord and vassal, but with time and the transformation of fiefs into hereditary holdings, the nature of the system came to be seen as a form of \"politics of land\" (an expression used by the historian [[Marc Bloch]]).  The 11th century in France saw what has been called by historians a \"feudal revolution\" or \"mutation\" and a \"fragmentation of powers\" (Bloch) that was unlike the development of feudalism in England or Italy or Germany in the same period or later:<ref>Chris Wickham, ''The Inheritance of Rome'', p. 522-3.</ref> Counties and duchies began to break down into smaller holdings as [[castellan]]s and lesser seigneurs took control of local lands, and (as comital families had done before them) lesser lords usurped/privatized a wide range of prerogatives and rights of the state, most importantly the highly profitable rights of justice, but also travel dues, market dues, fees for using woodlands, obligations to use the lord's mill, etc.<ref name=\"auto1\">Wickham, ''The Inheritance of Rome'', p. 518.</ref> (what [[Georges Duby]] called collectively the \"''seigneurie banale''\"<ref name=\"auto1\"/>).  Power in this period became more personal.<ref>Wickham, ''The Inheritance of Rome'', p.522.</ref>\n\nThis \"fragmentation of powers\" was not, however, systematic throughout France, and in certain counties (such as Flanders, Normandy, Anjou, Toulouse), counts were able to maintain control of their lands into the 12th century or later.<ref>Wickham, p.523.</ref>  Thus, in some regions (like Normandy and Flanders), the vassal/feudal system was an effective tool for ducal and comital control, linking vassals to their lords; but in other regions, the system led to significant confusion, all the more so as vassals could and frequently did pledge themselves to two or more lords.  In response to this, the idea of a \"[[liege lord]]\" was developed (where the obligations to one lord are regarded as superior) in the 12th century.<ref>Elizabeth M. Hallam. ''Capetian France 987\u20131328'', p.17.</ref>\n\n===End of European feudalism (1500\u20131850s)===\n{{Further|Abolition of feudalism in France}}\n\nMost of the military aspects of feudalism effectively ended by about 1500.<ref>\"The End of Feudalism\" in J.H.M. Salmon, ''Society in Crisis: France in the Sixteenth Century'' (1979) pp 19\u201326</ref> This was partly since the military shifted from armies consisting of the nobility to professional fighters thus reducing the nobility's claim on power, but also because the [[Black Death]] reduced the nobility's hold over the lower classes. Vestiges of the feudal system hung on in France until the [[French Revolution]] of 1790's, and the system lingered on in parts of Central and Eastern Europe as late as the 1850s. [[Slavery in Romania]] was abolished in 1856. Russia finally abolished [[serfdom]] in 1861.<ref>John Merriman, ''A History of Modern Europe: From the Renaissance to the Age of Napoleon'' (1996) pp 12\u201313</ref><ref>Jerzy Topolski, Continuity and discontinuity in the development of the feudal system in Eastern Europe (Xth to XVIIth centuries)\" ''Journal of European Economic History'' (1981) 10#2 pp: 373\u2013400.</ref>\n\nEven when the original feudal relationships had disappeared, there were many institutional remnants of feudalism left in place. Historian [[Georges Lefebvre]] explains how at an early stage of the [[French Revolution]], on just one night of August 4, 1789, France abolished the long-lasting remnants of the feudal order. It announced, \"The National Assembly abolishes the feudal system entirely.\" Lefebvre explains:\n\n{{quote|Without debate the Assembly enthusiastically adopted equality of taxation and redemption of all manorial rights except for those involving personal servitude\u2014which were to be abolished without indemnification.

Tr. L.A. Manyon. Two volume. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1961 {{ISBN|0-226-05979-0}}</ref> offers a wider definition than Ganshof's and includes within the feudal structure not only the warrior aristocracy bound by vassalage, but also the [[peasant]]ry bound by manorialism, and the estates of the Church. Thus the feudal order embraces society from top to bottom, though the \"powerful and well-differentiated social group of the urban classes\" came to occupy a distinct position to some extent outside the classic feudal hierarchy.\n\n==Historiography==\nThe idea of ''feudalism'' was unknown and the system it describes was not conceived of as a formal political system by the people living in the Medieval Period. This section describes the history of the idea of feudalism, how the concept originated among scholars and thinkers, how it changed over time, and modern debates about its use.\n\n===Evolution of the concept===\n{{English Feudalism}}\nThe concept of a feudal state or period, in the sense of either a regime or a period dominated by lords who possess financial or social power and prestige, became widely held in the middle of the 18th century, as a result of works such as [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu's]] ''De L'Esprit des Lois'' (1748; published in English as ''[[The Spirit of the Laws]]''), and [[Henri de Boulainvilliers]]\u2019s ''Histoire des anciens Parlements de France'' (1737; published in English as ''An Historical Account of the Ancient Parliaments of France or States-General of the Kingdom'', 1739).<ref name=cheyette/> In the 18th century, writers of the Enlightenment wrote about feudalism to denigrate the antiquated system of the ''[[Ancien R\u00e9gime]]'', or French monarchy. This was the [[Age of Enlightenment]] when writers valued reason and the Middle Ages were viewed as the \"[[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]\". Enlightenment authors generally mocked and ridiculed anything from the \"Dark Ages\" including feudalism, projecting its negative characteristics on the current French monarchy as a means of political gain.<ref name=bartlett>[[Robert Bartlett (historian)|Robert Bartlett]]. \"Perspectives on the Medieval World\" in ''Medieval Panorama'', 2001, {{ISBN|0-89236-642-7}}</ref> For them \"feudalism\" meant [[Fiefdom|seigneurial]] privileges and prerogatives. When the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|French Constituent Assembly]] abolished the \"feudal regime\" in August 1789 this is what was meant.\n\n[[Adam Smith]] used the term \"feudal system\" to describe a social and economic system defined by inherited social ranks, each of which possessed inherent social and economic privileges and obligations. In such a system wealth derived from agriculture, which was arranged not according to market forces but on the basis of customary labour services owed by [[serf]]s to landowning nobles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usna.edu/Users/history/abels/hh315/Feudal.htm |title=Feudalism |author=Richard Abels |date= |work= |publisher=usna.edu |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\n===Karl Marx===\n[[Karl Marx]] also used the term in the 19th century in his analysis of society's economic and political development, describing feudalism (or more usually feudal society or the feudal [[mode of production]]) as the order coming before [[capitalism]]. For Marx, what defined feudalism was the power of the ruling class (the [[aristocracy]]) in their control of arable land, leading to a [[class society]] based upon the exploitation of the peasants who farm these lands, typically under [[serfdom]] and principally by means of labour, produce and money rents.<ref name=daileader/> Marx thus defined feudalism primarily by its economic characteristics.\n\nHe also took it as a paradigm for understanding the power-relationships between capitalists and wage-labourers in his own time: \"in pre-capitalist systems it was obvious that most people did not control their own destiny\u2014under feudalism, for instance, serfs had to work for their lords. Capitalism seems different because people are in theory free to work for themselves or for others as they choose. Yet most workers have as little control over their lives as feudal serfs.\"<ref>Peter Singer, ''Marx: A Very Short Introduction'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000) [first published 1980], p. 91.</ref> Some later Marxist theorists (e.g. [[Eric Wolf]]) have applied this label to include non-European societies, grouping feudalism together with Imperial Chinese and pre-Columbian Incan societies as 'tributary'.\n\n===Later studies===\n{{Feudal status}}\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, [[John Horace Round]] and [[Frederic William Maitland]], both historians of medieval Britain, arrived at different conclusions as to the character of English society before the [[Norman Conquest]] in 1066. Round argued that the Normans had brought feudalism with them to England, while Maitland contended that its fundamentals were already in place in Britain before 1066. The debate continues today, but a consensus viewpoint is that England before the Conquest had commendation (which embodied some of the personal elements in feudalism) while [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]] introduced a modified and stricter northern French feudalism to England incorporating (1086) oaths of loyalty to the king by all who held by feudal tenure, even the vassals of his principal vassals (holding by feudal tenure meant that vassals must provide the quota of knights required by the king or a money payment in substitution).\n\nIn the 20th century, two outstanding historians offered still more widely differing perspectives. The French historian [[Marc Bloch]], arguably the most influential 20th-century medieval historian,<ref name=daileader/> approached feudalism not so much from a legal and military point of view but from a sociological one, presenting in ''Feudal Society'' (1939; English 1961) a feudal order not limited solely to the nobility. It is his radical notion that peasants were part of the feudal relationship that sets Bloch apart from his peers: while the vassal performed military service in exchange for the fief, the peasant performed physical labour in return for protection \u2013 both are a form of feudal relationship. According to Bloch, other elements of society can be seen in feudal terms; all the aspects of life were centered on \"lordship\", and so we can speak usefully of a feudal church structure, a feudal courtly (and anti-courtly) literature, and a feudal economy.<ref name=daileader/>\n\nIn contradistinction to Bloch, the Belgian historian [[Fran\u00e7ois-Louis Ganshof]] defined feudalism from a narrow legal and military perspective, arguing that feudal relationships existed only within the medieval nobility itself. Ganshof articulated this concept in ''Qu'est-ce que la f\u00e9odalit\u00e9?'' (\"What is feudalism?\", 1944; translated in English as ''Feudalism''). His classic definition of feudalism is widely accepted today among medieval scholars,<ref name=daileader>[[Philip Daileader]], \"Feudalism\", ''The High Middle Ages'', Course No. 869, [[The Teaching Company]], {{ISBN|1-56585-827-1}}</ref> though questioned both by those who view the concept in wider terms and by those who find insufficient uniformity in noble exchanges to support such a model.\n\nAlthough he was never formally a student in the circle of scholars around Marc Bloch and [[Lucien Febvre]] that came to be known as the [[Annales School]], [[Georges Duby]] was an exponent of the ''Annaliste'' tradition. In  a published version of his 1952 doctoral thesis entitled ''La soci\u00e9t\u00e9 aux XIe et XIIe si\u00e8cles dans la r\u00e9gion m\u00e2connaise'' (''Society in the 11th and 12th centuries in the [[M\u00e2connais]] region''), and working from the extensive documentary sources surviving from the Burgundian [[Cluny Abbey|monastery of Cluny]], as well as the dioceses of [[Ancient Diocese of M\u00e2con|M\u00e2con]] and [[Dijon]], Duby excavated the complex social and economic relationships among the individuals and institutions of the [[M\u00e2connais]] region and charted a profound shift in the social structures of medieval society around the year 1000. He argued that in early 11th century, governing institutions\u2014particularly comital courts established under the [[Carolingian]] monarchy\u2014that had represented public justice and order in Burgundy during the 9th and 10th centuries receded and gave way to a new feudal order wherein independent aristocratic knights wielded power over peasant communities through strong-arm tactics and threats of violence.\n\nIn 1939 the Austrian historian {{ill|Theodor Mayer|de|Theodor Mayer (Historiker)}} subordinated the feudal state as secondary to his concept of a persons association state (''{{ill|Personenverbandsstaat|de|Personenverbandsstaat}}''), understanding it in contrast to the [[territorial state]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Companion to Historiography |first=Michael |last=Bentley |date=2006 |publisher=Routledge |access-date=2019-11-17 |page=126 |url=https://books.google.at/books?id=JWqIAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA126&lpg=PA126&dq=personenverbandsstaat+english&source=bl&ots=v7irDNs7Vb&sig=ACfU3U0IEV0KpSOCC4h8pWqPYmnZWLionQ&hl=de&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjC1-K4o-_lAhVHY1AKHYweAb44ChDoATAHegQICBAB#v=onepage&q=personenverbandsstaat&f=false}}</ref> This form of statehood, identified with the [[Feudalism in the Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Empire]], is described as the most complete form of medieval rule, completing conventional feudal structure of lordship and vassalage with the personal association between the nobility.<ref>{{cite book |title=Covenant and commonwealth : from Christian separation through the Protestant Reformation |volume=Volume 2 |first=Daniel Judah |last=Elazar |date=1996 |publisher=Transaction Publishers |access-date=2019-11-17 |page=76 |url=https://books.google.at/books?id=yKOIqPsf7acC&pg=PA381&lpg=PA381&dq=personenverbandsstaat+english&source=bl&ots=MWhCh0jASY&sig=ACfU3U3s47Wb-vPFRJptf72zGORr9N7hYw&hl=de&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjC1-K4o-_lAhVHY1AKHYweAb44ChDoATAGegQICRAB#v=onepage&q=personenverbandsstaat&f=false}}</ref>\u00a0 But the applicability of this concept to cases outside of the Holy Roman Empire has been questioned, as by Susan Reynolds.<ref>{{cite book |title=Fiefs and Vassals: The Medieval Evidence Reinterpreted |first=Susan |last=Raynolds |date=1996 |publisher=Oxford University Press |access-date=2019-11-17 |page=397 |url=https://books.google.at/books?id=vkQ8z7S2cIIC&pg=PA397&lpg=PA397&dq=personenverbandsstaat+english&source=bl&ots=dEGQY6D7fT&sig=ACfU3U3oHYi2118XOe_lFWxaP3DCNRQWjQ&hl=de&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjC1-K4\u00fco-_lAhVHY1AKHYweAb44ChDoATAEegQIBxAB#v=onepage&q=personenverbandsstaat&f=false}}</ref> The concept has also been questioned and superseded in German histography because of its bias and reductionism towards legitimating the [[F\u00fchrerprinzip]].\n\n===Challenges to the feudal model===\nIn 1974, U.S. historian [[Elizabeth A. R. Brown]]<ref name=ebrown>{{Cite journal\n| doi = 10.2307/1869563\n| volume = 79\n| issue = 4\n| pages = 1063\u201388\n| last = Brown\n| first = Elizabeth A.

Having noted the current use of many, often contradictory, definitions of ''feudalism'', she argued that the word is only a construct with no basis in medieval reality, an invention of modern historians read back \"tyrannically\" into the historical record. Supporters of Brown have suggested that the term should be expunged from history textbooks and lectures on medieval history entirely.<ref name=daileader/> In ''Fiefs and Vassals: The Medieval Evidence Reinterpreted'' (1994),<ref name=reynolds>Reynolds, Susan, ''Fiefs and Vassals: The Medieval Evidence Reinterpreted.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1994 {{ISBN|0-19-820648-8}}</ref> [[Susan Reynolds]] expanded upon Brown's original thesis. Although some contemporaries questioned Reynolds's methodology, other historians have supported it and her argument.<ref name=daileader/> Reynolds argues:\n:Too many models of feudalism used for comparisons, even by Marxists, are still either constructed on the 16th-century basis or incorporate what, in a Marxist view, must surely be superficial or irrelevant features from it.  Even when one restricts oneself to Europe and to feudalism in its narrow sense it is extremely doubtful whether feudo-vassalic institutions formed a coherent bundle of institutions or concepts that were structurally separate from other  institutions  and concepts of the time.<ref>Reynolds, p 11</ref>\n\nThe term ''feudal'' has also been applied to non-Western societies in which institutions and attitudes similar to those of medieval Europe are perceived to have prevailed (See [[Examples of feudalism]]). Japan has been extensively studied in this regard.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 177767|title = Feudalism in Japan-A Reassessment|journal = Comparative Studies in Society and History|volume = 5|issue = 1|pages = 15\u201351|last1 = Hall|first1 = John Whitney|year = 1962|doi = 10.1017/S001041750000150X}}</ref>  Friday notes that in the 21st century historians of Japan rarely invoke feudalism; instead of looking at similarities, specialists attempting comparative analysis concentrate on fundamental differences.<ref>Karl Friday,  \"The Futile Paradigm: In Quest of Feudalism in Early Medieval Japan,\" ''History Compass'' 8.2 (2010): 179\u2013196.</ref> Ultimately, critics say, the many ways the term ''feudalism'' has been used have deprived it of specific meaning, leading some historians and [[political theorist]]s to reject it as a useful concept for understanding society.<ref name=daileader/>\n\nRichard Abels notes that \"Western Civilization and World Civilization textbooks now shy away from the term 'feudalism'.\"<ref>Richard Abels, \"The Historiography of a Construct: 'Feudalism' and the Medieval Historian.\" ''History Compass'' (2009) 7#3 pp: 1008\u20131031.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Bastard feudalism]]\n* {{ill|Personenverbandsstaat|de|Personenverbandsstaat}}\n* [[Cestui que]]\n* [[Examples of feudalism]]\n* [[English feudal barony]]\n* [[Feudal duties]]\n* [[Feudalism in the Holy Roman Empire]]\n* [[Lehnsmann]]\n* [[Majorat]]\n* [[Neo-feudalism]]\n* ''[[Nulle terre sans seigneur]]''\n* [[Protofeudalism]]\n* [[Quia Emptores]]\n* [[Scottish feudal barony]]\n* [[Statutes of Mortmain]]\n* [[Suzerainty]]\n* [[Vassal]]\n* [[Vassal state]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n'''Military:'''\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Knights]]\n* [[Medieval warfare]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n'''Non-European:'''\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Fengjian]] (Chinese)\n* [[Hacienda]]\n* [[History of Japan#Feudal Japan|Feudal Japan]]\n* [[Feudalism in Pakistan]]\n* [[Indian feudalism]]\n* [[Mandala (political model)]]\n* [[Ziamet]]\n* [[Zemene Mesafint]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Bloch, Marc, ''Feudal Society.''
