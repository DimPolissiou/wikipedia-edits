The series is a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] prequel to ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'' and begins with the character [[Sheldon Cooper]] at the age of nine, living with his family in [[East Texas]] and going to high school. [[Iain Armitage]] stars as young Sheldon, alongside [[Zoe Perry]], [[Lance Barber]], [[Montana Jordan]], Raegan Revord, and [[Annie Potts]]. [[Jim Parsons]], who portrays the adult Sheldon Cooper on ''The Big Bang Theory'', narrates the series and serves as an [[executive producer]].\n\nDevelopment of the prequel series began in November 2016, from an initial idea that Parsons passed along to ''The Big Bang Theory'' producers. The following March, Armitage and Perry were cast, and the series was ordered by CBS. The series premiered as a special preview on September 25, 2017, and two days later, CBS picked up the series for a full season of 22 episodes. From November 2, 2017, new episodes began airing weekly. In January 2018, CBS renewed the series for a second season which premiered on September 24, 2018, and in February 2019, for a third and fourth season, with the third season having premiered on September 26, 2019.<!--Per WP:CITELEAD, references are not needed in the lead if it is sourced in the body of the article!-->\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Premise==\nThe series takes place in the late 1980s and early 1990s; and follows [[Sheldon Cooper]] as a young boy attending high school in the fictional town of Medford, [[Texas]], aged nine in the first season<ref name=\"YoungSheldonOrdered\" /> as he tries to fit into the world around him while his family and friends attempt to deal with his unique intellectual capabilities and social challenges.<ref name=\"YoungSheldonOrdered\" /><ref name=\"PremiereDate\" />\n\nIn the series premiere, adult Sheldon states that \"nobody I knew in [[East Texas]] in 1989 cared about [[Newtonian physics]]\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/young-sheldon-is-the-anti-big-bang-theory-thats-why-its-great|title=\u2018Young Sheldon\u2019 Is the Anti-\u2018Big Bang Theory.\u2019 That\u2019s Why It\u2019s Great.|first=Kevin|last=Fallon|date=September 25, 2017|publisher=[[The Daily Beast]]|access-date=October 17, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171130112352/https://www.thedailybeast.com/young-sheldon-is-the-anti-big-bang-theory-thats-why-its-great|archive-date=November 30, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>{{efn|Dr. Sturgis and Dr. Linkletter, two college physics professors who teach the classes in which Sheldon enrolls, are not introduced until Season 1 Episode 19 and Season 2 Episode 13 respectively.}}\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{main|List of The Big Bang Theory and Young Sheldon characters}}\n\n===Main===\n* [[Iain Armitage]] as [[Sheldon Cooper]], a [[child prodigy]] with a \"once-in-a-generation mind capable of advanced mathematics and science\".

In the parent series finale, Sheldon wins the Nobel Prize. In another scene in the Young Sheldon episode, Nobel Prize winners are announced out over a montage showing the main characters from the parent series [[Leonard Hofstadter|Leonard]], [[Penny (The Big Bang Theory)|Penny]], [[Rajesh Koothrappali|Raj]], [[Howard Wolowitz|Howard]], [[Bernadette Rostenkowski|Bernadette]] and [[Amy Farrah Fowler|Amy]] as children.

The series is a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] prequel to ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'' and begins with the character [[Sheldon Cooper]] at the age of nine, living with his family in [[East Texas]] and going to high school. [[Iain Armitage]] stars as young Sheldon, alongside [[Zoe Perry]], [[Lance Barber]], [[Montana Jordan]], Raegan Revord, and [[Annie Potts]]. [[Jim Parsons]], who portrays the adult Sheldon Cooper on ''The Big Bang Theory'', narrates the series and serves as an [[executive producer]].\n\nDevelopment of the prequel series began in November 2016, from an initial idea that Parsons passed along to ''The Big Bang Theory'' producers. The following March, Armitage and Perry were cast, and the series was ordered by CBS. The series premiered as a special preview on September 25, 2017, and two days later, CBS picked up the series for a full season of 22 episodes. From November 2, 2017, new episodes began airing weekly. In January 2018, CBS renewed the series for a second season which premiered on September 24, 2018, and in February 2019, for a third and fourth season, with the third season having premiered on September 26, 2019.<!--Per WP:CITELEAD, references are not needed in the lead if it is sourced in the body of the article!-->\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Premise==\nThe series takes place in the late 1980s and early 1990s; and follows [[Sheldon Cooper]] as a young boy attending high school in the fictional town of Medford, [[Texas]], aged nine in the first season<ref name=\"YoungSheldonOrdered\" /> as he tries to fit into the world around him while his family and friends attempt to deal with his unique intellectual capabilities and social challenges.<ref name=\"YoungSheldonOrdered\" /><ref name=\"PremiereDate\" />\n\nIn the series premiere, adult Sheldon states that \"nobody I knew in [[East Texas]] in 1989 cared about [[Newtonian physics]]\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/young-sheldon-is-the-anti-big-bang-theory-thats-why-its-great|title=\u2018Young Sheldon\u2019 Is the Anti-\u2018Big Bang Theory.\u2019 That\u2019s Why It\u2019s Great.|first=Kevin|last=Fallon|date=September 25, 2017|publisher=[[The Daily Beast]]|access-date=October 17, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171130112352/https://www.thedailybeast.com/young-sheldon-is-the-anti-big-bang-theory-thats-why-its-great|archive-date=November 30, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>{{efn|Dr. Sturgis and Dr. Linkletter, two college physics professors who teach the classes in which Sheldon enrolls, are not introduced until Season 1 Episode 19 and Season 2 Episode 13 respectively.}}\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{main|List of The Big Bang Theory and Young Sheldon characters}}\n\n===Main===\n* [[Iain Armitage]] as [[Sheldon Cooper]], a [[child prodigy]] with a \"once-in-a-generation mind capable of advanced mathematics and science\".

Additionally, rising house prices in Southwold have led to several properties in Reydon being purchased as second homes, often unoccupied for long. However, this is unlikely to affect the increase in permanent population, at least in the short term.\n\nIn 2004, a 4400 m\u00b2 [[distribution centre]] for [[Adnams Brewery]] was constructed on the western edge of Reydon on the site of an old open-cast sand quarry.\n\n==The Church of St Margaret==\n[[File:Reydon.jpg|thumb|right|St Margaret's Church, Reydon in the snow]]\nThe parish church, dedicated to St [[Margaret of Antioch]], stands in Wangford Road, to the north-west of the village. One of its striking features is a large, unnamed bronze angel inscribed \"To Fanny my beloved wife\". The present building is mainly from the early 14th century. The tower was built about 1325. The chancel was restyled in the 15th century, and has many niches for saints in the window splays.
