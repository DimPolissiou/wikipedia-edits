Bones protect the various organs of the body, produce [[red blood cell|red]] and [[white blood cell]]s, store [[mineral]]s, provide structure and support for the body, and enable [[animal locomotion|mobility]]. Bones come in a variety of shapes and sizes and have a complex internal and external structure. They are lightweight yet strong and hard, and serve multiple [[Function (biology)|functions]].\n\nBone tissue (osseous tissue) is a [[hard tissue]], a type of dense [[connective tissue]].  It has a [[honeycomb|honeycomb-like]] [[matrix (biology)|matrix]] internally, which helps to give the bone rigidity.  Bone tissue is made up of different types of [[bone cell]]s. [[Osteoblast]]s and [[osteocyte]]s are involved in the formation and [[mineralization (biology)|mineralization]] of bone; [[osteoclast]]s are involved in the [[bone resorption|resorption]] of bone tissue. Modified (flattened) osteoblasts become the lining cells that form a protective layer on the bone surface. The mineralised matrix of bone tissue has an organic component of mainly [[collagen]] called ''[[ossein]]'' and an inorganic component of [[bone mineral]] made up of various salts. Bone tissue is a [[mineralized tissues|mineralized tissue]] of two types, [[Bone tissue#Structure|cortical bone]] and [[Bone tissue#Structure|cancellous bone]]. Other types of tissue found in bones include [[bone marrow]], [[endosteum]], [[periosteum]], [[nerve]]s, [[blood vessel]]s and [[cartilage]].\n\nIn the [[human body]] at birth, there are approximately 270 bones present; many of these fuse together during development, leaving a total of 212 separate bones in the adult, not counting numerous small [[sesamoid bone]]s.<ref>{{cite book|title = The Anatomy and Biology of the Human Skeleton|url = https://archive.org/details/anatomybiologyo00stee|url-access = registration|author1=Steele, D.

It is the [[bone mineral]]ization that give bones rigidity.\n\nBone is actively constructed and remodeled throughout life by special bone cells known as osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Within any single bone, the tissue is woven into two main patterns, known as cortical and cancellous bone, and each with different appearance and characteristics.\n\n===Cortical bone===\n\n[[File:Illu compact spongy bone.jpg|thumb|Cross-section details of a long bone]]\nThe hard outer layer of bones is composed of cortical bone, which is also called compact bone as it is much denser than cancellous bone. It forms the hard exterior (cortex) of bones. The cortical bone gives bone its smooth, white, and solid appearance, and accounts for 80% of the total bone mass of an adult human [[skeleton]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} It facilitates bone's main functions - to support the whole body, to protect organs, to provide [[lever]]s for movement, and to store and release chemical elements, mainly calcium. It consists of multiple microscopic columns, each called an [[osteon]]. Each column is multiple layers of [[osteoblast]]s and [[osteocyte]]s around a central canal called the [[haversian canal]]. [[Volkmann's canal]]s at right angles connect the osteons together. The columns are metabolically active, and as bone is reabsorbed and created the nature and location of the cells within the osteon will change. Cortical bone is covered by a [[periosteum]] on its outer surface, and an [[endosteum]] on its inner surface. The endosteum is the boundary between the cortical bone and the cancellous bone.{{sfn|Deakin|2006|p=192}} The primary anatomical and functional unit of cortical bone is the [[osteon]].\n\n===Cancellous bone===\n\n[[File:Spongy bone - trabecules.jpg|thumb|Micrograph of cancellous bone]]\nCancellous bone, also called trabecular or spongy bone,{{sfn|Deakin|2006|p=192}} is the internal tissue of the skeletal bone and is an open cell [[Porosity|porous]] network. Cancellous bone has a higher [[surface-area-to-volume ratio]] than cortical bone and it is less [[dense]]. This makes it weaker and more flexible. The greater surface area also makes it suitable for metabolic activities such as the exchange of calcium ions. Cancellous bone is typically found at the ends of long bones, near joints and in the interior of vertebrae. Cancellous bone is highly [[vascular]] and often contains red [[bone marrow]] where [[hematopoiesis]], the production of blood cells, occurs. The primary anatomical and functional unit of cancellous bone is the [[trabecula]]. The trabeculae are aligned towards the mechanical load distribution that a bone experiences within long bones such as the [[femur]].  As far as short bones are concerned, trabecular alignment has been studied in the [[vertebral]] [[pedicle of vertebral arch|pedicle]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Gdyczynski | first1 = C.M. | last2 = Manbachi | first2 = A. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2014| title = On estimating the directionality distribution in pedicle trabecular bone from micro-CT images | url = | journal = Journal of Physiological Measurements | volume = 35 | issue = 12| pages = 2415\u20132428 | doi = 10.1088/0967-3334/35/12/2415 | pmid = 25391037 | bibcode = 2014PhyM...35.2415G }}</ref> Thin formations of [[osteoblast]]s covered in endosteum create an irregular network of spaces,{{sfn|Deakin|2006|p=195}} known as trabeculae.

These cells include [[osteoblast]]s, which are involved in the creation and [[mineralized tissue|mineralization]] of bone tissue, [[osteocytes]], and [[osteoclast]]s, which are involved in the reabsorption of bone tissue. Osteoblasts and osteocytes are derived from [[osteoprogenitor]] cells, but [[osteoclast]]s are derived from the same cells that differentiate to form [[macrophage]]s and [[monocyte]]s.{{sfn|Deakin|2006|p=189}} Within the marrow of the bone there are also [[hematopoietic stem cell]]s. These cells give rise to other cells, including [[white blood cell]]s, [[red blood cell]]s, and [[platelet]]s.{{sfn|Deakin|2006|p=58}}\n\n====Osteoblast====\n[[File:Active osteoblasts.jpg|thumb|[[Micrograph|Light micrograph]] of [[Bone decalcification|decalcified]] cancellous bone displaying osteoblasts actively synthesizing osteoid, containing two osteocytes.]] [[Osteoblast]]s are mononucleate bone-forming cells. They are located on the surface of osteon seams and make a [[protein]] mixture known as [[osteoid]], which mineralizes to become bone.{{sfn|Deakin|2006|pp=189\u2013190}} The osteoid seam is a narrow region of newly formed organic matrix, not yet mineralized, located on the surface of a bone. Osteoid is primarily composed of Type I [[collagen]]. Osteoblasts also manufacture [[hormone]]s, such as [[prostaglandin]]s, to act on the bone itself. The osteoblast creates and repairs new bone by actually building around itself. First, the osteoblast puts up [[collagen]] fibers. These collagen fibers are used as a framework for the osteoblasts' work. The osteoblast then deposits calcium phosphate which is hardened by [[hydroxide]] and [[bicarbonate]] ions. The brand new bone created by the osteoblast is called [[osteoid]].<ref>Washington. \"The O' Cells.\" Bone Cells. University of Washington, n.d. Web. 3 Apr. 2013.</ref> Once the osteoblast is finished working it is actually trapped inside the bone once it hardens.

Osteocytes have many processes that reach out to meet osteoblasts and other osteocytes probably for the purposes of communication.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1016/j.abb.2014.05.015|pmid = 24875146|title = Regulation of cortical and trabecular bone mass by communication between osteoblasts, osteocytes and osteoclasts|journal = Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics|volume = 561|pages = 22\u201328|year = 2014|last1 = Sims|first1 = Natalie A.|last2 = Vrahnas|first2 = Christina}}</ref> Osteocytes remain in contact with other cells in the bone through gap junctions\u2014coupled cell processes\u2014which pass through small channels in the bone matrix called the [[canaliculus (bone)|canaliculi]].\n\n====Osteoclast====\n[[Osteoclast]]s are very large [[multinucleate]] cells that are responsible for the breakdown of bones by the process of [[bone resorption]]. New bone is then formed by the osteoblasts. Bone is constantly [[bone remodeling|remodelled]] by the resorption of osteoclasts and created by osteoblasts.{{sfn|Deakin|2006|p=189}} Osteoclasts are large cells with multiple [[Cell nucleus|nuclei]] located on bone surfaces in what are called ''Howship's lacunae'' (or ''resorption pits''). These lacunae are the result of surrounding bone tissue that has been reabsorbed.{{sfn|Deakin|2006|p=190}} Because the osteoclasts are derived from a [[monocyte]] [[stem cell|stem-cell]] lineage, they are equipped with [[Phagocytosis|phagocytic]]-like mechanisms similar to circulating [[macrophages]].{{sfn|Deakin|2006|p=189}} Osteoclasts mature and/or migrate to discrete bone surfaces. Upon arrival, active enzymes, such as [[tartrate resistant acid phosphatase]], are [[Secretion|secreted]] against the mineral substrate.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} The reabsorption of bone by osteoclasts also plays a role in [[calcium]] [[homeostasis]].{{sfn|Deakin|2006|p=190}}\n\n===Extracellular matrix===\n{{Main|Extracellular matrix}}\nBones consist of living cells embedded in a mineralized organic matrix. This matrix consists of organic components, mainly [[Collagen#Types of collagen|type I collagen]] \u2013 \"organic\" referring to materials produced as a result of the human body \u2013 and inorganic components, primarily [[hydroxyapatite]] and other salts of [[calcium]] and [[phosphate]]. Above 30% of the acellular part of bone consists of the organic components, and 70% of salts.{{sfn|Hall|2005|p=981}} The [[collagen]] fibers give bone its [[ultimate tensile strength|tensile strength]], and the interspersed crystals of [[hydroxyapatite]] give bone its [[compressive strength]]. These effects are [[synergy|synergistic]].{{sfn|Hall|2005|p=981}}\n\nThe inorganic composition of bone ([[bone mineral]]) is primarily formed from salts of [[calcium]] and [[phosphate]], the major salt being [[hydroxyapatite]] (Ca<sub>10</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>6</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>).{{sfn|Hall|2005|p=981}} The exact composition of the matrix may be subject to change over time due to nutrition and [[biomineralization]], with the ratio of [[calcium]] to [[phosphate]] varying between 1.3 and 2.0 (per weight), and trace minerals such as [[magnesium]], [[sodium]], [[potassium]] and [[carbonate]] also being found.{{sfn|Hall|2005|p=981}}\n\n{{anchor|Woven vs. lamellar bone}}Type I collagen composes 90\u201395% of the organic matrix, with remainder of the matrix being a homogenous liquid called [[ground substance]] consisting of [[proteoglycan]]s such as [[hyaluronic acid]] and [[chondroitin sulfate]],{{sfn|Hall|2005|p=981}} as well as non-collagenous proteins such as [[osteocalcin]], [[osteopontin]] or [[bone sialoprotein]]. Collagen consists of strands of repeating units, which give bone tensile strength, and are arranged in an overlapping fashion that prevents shear stress. The function of ground substance is not fully known.{{sfn|Hall|2005|p=981}} Two types of bone can be identified microscopically according to the arrangement of collagen: woven and lamellar.\n* Woven bone, (also known as ''fibrous bone'') which is characterized by a haphazard organization of collagen fibers and is mechanically weak.<ref name=\"Curry2006\">Currey, John D. (2002). [http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s7313.html \"The Structure of Bone Tissue\"], pp.  12\u201314 in ''Bones: Structure and Mechanics''. Princeton University Press. Princeton, NJ. {{ISBN|9781400849505}}</ref>\n* Lamellar bone, which has a regular parallel alignment of collagen into sheets (\"lamellae\") and is mechanically strong.<ref name=\"Curry2006\" />\n\n[[File:Woven bone matrix.jpg|thumb|right|[[Transmission electron microscopy|Transmission]] [[electron micrograph]] of decalcified woven bone matrix displaying characteristic irregular orientation of collagen fibers.]]\nWoven bone is produced when osteoblasts produce osteoid rapidly, which occurs initially in all [[fetus|fetal]] bones, but is later replaced by more resilient lamellar bone. In adults woven bone is created after [[Bone fracture|fractures]] or in [[Paget's disease of bone|Paget's disease]]. Woven bone is weaker, with a smaller number of randomly oriented collagen fibers, but forms quickly; it is for this appearance of the fibrous matrix that the bone is termed ''woven''. It is soon replaced by lamellar bone, which is highly organized in [[concentric]] sheets with a much lower proportion of osteocytes to surrounding tissue. Lamellar bone, which makes its first appearance in humans in the [[fetus]] during the third trimester,<ref name=\"Salentijn\">Salentijn, L. ''Biology of Mineralized Tissues: Cartilage and Bone'', [[Columbia University College of Dental Medicine]] post-graduate dental lecture series, 2007</ref> is stronger and filled with many collagen fibers parallel to other fibers in the same layer (these parallel columns are called osteons).  In [[cross section (geometry)|cross-section]], the fibers run in opposite directions in alternating layers, much like in [[plywood]], assisting in the bone's ability to resist [[torsion (mechanics)|torsion]] forces. After a fracture, woven bone forms initially and is gradually replaced by lamellar bone during a process known as \"bony substitution.\" Compared to woven bone, lamellar bone formation takes place more slowly. The orderly deposition of collagen fibers restricts the formation of osteoid to about 1 to 2&nbsp;[[Micrometre|\u00b5m]] per day. Lamellar bone also requires a relatively flat surface to lay the collagen fibers in parallel or concentric layers.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n{{Clear}}\n\n====Deposition====\n\nThe extracellular matrix of bone is laid down by [[osteoblast]]s, which secrete both collagen and ground substance. These synthesise collagen within the cell, and then secrete collagen fibrils. The collagen fibers rapidly [[polymer]]ise to form collagen strands. At this stage they are not yet mineralised, and are called \"osteoid\". Around the strands calcium and phosphate [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitate]] on the surface of these strands, within days to weeks becoming crystals of hydroxyapatite.{{sfn|Hall|2005|p=981}}\n\nIn order to mineralise the bone, the osteoblasts secrete [[vesicle (biology)|vesicles]] containing [[alkaline phosphatase]]. This cleaves the phosphate groups and acts as the foci for calcium and phosphate deposition. The vesicles then rupture and act as a centre for crystals to grow on. More particularly, bone mineral is formed from globular and plate structures.<ref name=r1>{{cite journal|author1=Bertazzo, S.  |author2=Bertran, C.

Other anatomical terms are also used to describe [[Anatomical terms of location|the location of bones]]. Like other anatomical terms, many of these derive from [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]]. Some anatomists still use Latin to refer to bones. The term \"osseous\", and the prefix \"osteo-\", referring to things related to bone, are still used commonly today.\n\nSome examples of terms used to describe bones include the term \"foramen\" to describe a hole through which something passes, and a \"canal\" or \"meatus\" to describe a tunnel-like structure. A protrusion from a bone can be called a number of terms, including a \"condyle\", \"crest\", \"spine\", \"eminence\", \"tubercle\" or \"tuberosity\", depending on the protrusion's shape and location. In general, [[long bone]]s are said to have a \"head\", \"neck\", and \"body\".\n\nWhen two bones join together, they are said to \"articulate\". If the two bones have a fibrous connection and are relatively immobile, then the joint is called a \"suture\".\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Bone growth.png|300px|thumb|left|Endochondral ossification]]\n[[File:Bone (1).jpg|thumb|Section through a juvenile knee joint (rat) showing the cartilagineous growth plates]]\nThe formation of bone is called [[ossification]].

They are responsible for the formation of the diaphyses of long bones, short bones and certain parts of irregular bones. Secondary ossification occurs after birth, and forms the [[Epiphysis|epiphyses]] of long bones and the extremities of irregular and flat bones.

These processes occur in tandem at site-specific locations.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\n===Remodeling===\n{{Main|Bone remodeling}}\nBone is constantly being created and replaced in a process known as [[Bone remodeling|remodeling]]. This ongoing turnover of bone is a process of resorption followed by replacement of bone with little change in shape. This is accomplished through osteoblasts and osteoclasts.

The cells also use [[paracrine signalling]] to control the activity of each other.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} For example, the rate at which osteoclasts resorb bone is inhibited by [[calcitonin]] and [[osteoprotegerin]].  Calcitonin is produced by [[parafollicular cell]]s in the [[thyroid gland]], and can bind to receptors on osteoclasts to directly inhibit osteoclast activity. Osteoprotegerin is secreted by osteoblasts and is able to bind RANK-L, inhibiting osteoclast stimulation.<ref name = Boron/>\n\nOsteoblasts can also be stimulated to increase bone mass through increased secretion of [[osteoid]] and by [[Enzyme inhibitor|inhibiting]] the ability of osteoclasts to break down [[osseous tissue]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Increased secretion of osteoid is stimulated by the secretion of [[growth hormone]] by the [[pituitary]], [[thyroid hormone]] and the sex hormones ([[estrogen]]s and [[androgen]]s).

[[Vitamin D]], [[parathyroid hormone]] and stimulation from osteocytes induce osteoblasts to increase secretion of RANK-[[ligand]] and [[interleukin 6]], which cytokines then stimulate increased reabsorption of bone by osteoclasts. These same compounds also increase secretion of [[macrophage colony-stimulating factor]] by osteoblasts, which promotes the differentiation of progenitor cells into osteoclasts, and decrease secretion of osteoprotegerin.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\n===Bone volume===\nBone volume is determined by the rates of bone formation and bone resorption. Recent research has suggested that certain growth factors may work to locally alter bone formation by increasing osteoblast activity.

Cancers of the bone marrow inside the bone can also affect bone tissue, examples including [[leukemia]] and [[multiple myeloma]]. Bone may also be affected by cancers in other parts of the body. Cancers in other parts of the body may release [[parathyroid hormone]] or [[parathyroid hormone-related peptide]]. This increases bone reabsorption, and can lead to bone fractures.\n\nBone tissue that is destroyed or altered as a result of cancers is distorted, weakened, and more prone to fracture. This may lead to compression of the [[spinal cord]], destruction of the marrow resulting in [[bruising]], [[bleeding]] and [[immunosuppression]], and is one cause of bone pain. If the cancer is metastatic, then there might be other symptoms depending on the site of the original cancer. Some bone cancers can also be felt.\n\nCancers of the bone are managed according to their type, their [[cancer staging|stage]], prognosis, and what symptoms they cause.

Bones protect the various organs of the body, produce [[red blood cell|red]] and [[white blood cell]]s, store [[mineral]]s, provide structure and support for the body, and enable [[animal locomotion|mobility]]. Bones come in a variety of shapes and sizes and have a complex internal and external structure. They are lightweight yet strong and hard, and serve multiple [[Function (biology)|functions]].\n\nBone tissue (osseous tissue) is a [[hard tissue]], a type of dense [[connective tissue]].  It has a [[honeycomb|honeycomb-like]] [[matrix (biology)|matrix]] internally, which helps to give the bone rigidity.  Bone tissue is made up of different types of [[bone cell]]s. [[Osteoblast]]s and [[osteocyte]]s are involved in the formation and [[mineralization (biology)|mineralization]] of bone; [[osteoclast]]s are involved in the [[bone resorption|resorption]] of bone tissue. Modified (flattened) osteoblasts become the lining cells that form a protective layer on the bone surface. The mineralised matrix of bone tissue has an organic component of mainly [[collagen]] called ''[[ossein]]'' and an inorganic component of [[bone mineral]] made up of various salts. Bone tissue is a [[mineralized tissues|mineralized tissue]] of two types, [[Bone tissue#Structure|cortical bone]] and [[Bone tissue#Structure|cancellous bone]]. Other types of tissue found in bones include [[bone marrow]], [[endosteum]], [[periosteum]], [[nerve]]s, [[blood vessel]]s and [[cartilage]].\n\nIn the [[human body]] at birth, there are approximately 270 bones present; many of these fuse together during development, leaving a total of 212 separate bones in the adult, not counting numerous small [[sesamoid bone]]s.<ref>{{cite book|title = The Anatomy and Biology of the Human Skeleton|url = https://archive.org/details/anatomybiologyo00stee|url-access = registration|author1=Steele, D.

It is the [[bone mineral]]ization that give bones rigidity.\n\nBone is actively constructed and remodeled throughout life by special bone cells known as osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Within any single bone, the tissue is woven into two main patterns, known as cortical and cancellous bone, and each with different appearance and characteristics.\n\n===Cortical bone===\n\n[[File:Illu compact spongy bone.jpg|thumb|Cross-section details of a long bone]]\nThe hard outer layer of bones is composed of cortical bone, which is also called compact bone as it is much denser than cancellous bone. It forms the hard exterior (cortex) of bones. The cortical bone gives bone its smooth, white, and solid appearance, and accounts for 80% of the total bone mass of an adult human [[skeleton]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} It facilitates bone's main functions - to support the whole body, to protect organs, to provide [[lever]]s for movement, and to store and release chemical elements, mainly calcium. It consists of multiple microscopic columns, each called an [[osteon]]. Each column is multiple layers of [[osteoblast]]s and [[osteocyte]]s around a central canal called the [[haversian canal]]. [[Volkmann's canal]]s at right angles connect the osteons together. The columns are metabolically active, and as bone is reabsorbed and created the nature and location of the cells within the osteon will change. Cortical bone is covered by a [[periosteum]] on its outer surface, and an [[endosteum]] on its inner surface. The endosteum is the boundary between the cortical bone and the cancellous bone.{{sfn|Deakin|2006|p=192}} The primary anatomical and functional unit of cortical bone is the [[osteon]].\n\n===Cancellous bone===\n\n[[File:Spongy bone - trabecules.jpg|thumb|Micrograph of cancellous bone]]\nCancellous bone, also called trabecular or spongy bone,{{sfn|Deakin|2006|p=192}} is the internal tissue of the skeletal bone and is an open cell [[Porosity|porous]] network. Cancellous bone has a higher [[surface-area-to-volume ratio]] than cortical bone and it is less [[dense]]. This makes it weaker and more flexible. The greater surface area also makes it suitable for metabolic activities such as the exchange of calcium ions. Cancellous bone is typically found at the ends of long bones, near joints and in the interior of vertebrae. Cancellous bone is highly [[vascular]] and often contains red [[bone marrow]] where [[hematopoiesis]], the production of blood cells, occurs. The primary anatomical and functional unit of cancellous bone is the [[trabecula]]. The trabeculae are aligned towards the mechanical load distribution that a bone experiences within long bones such as the [[femur]].  As far as short bones are concerned, trabecular alignment has been studied in the [[vertebral]] [[pedicle of vertebral arch|pedicle]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Gdyczynski | first1 = C.M. | last2 = Manbachi | first2 = A. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2014| title = On estimating the directionality distribution in pedicle trabecular bone from micro-CT images | url = | journal = Journal of Physiological Measurements | volume = 35 | issue = 12| pages = 2415\u20132428 | doi = 10.1088/0967-3334/35/12/2415 | pmid = 25391037 | bibcode = 2014PhyM...35.2415G }}</ref> Thin formations of [[osteoblast]]s covered in endosteum create an irregular network of spaces,{{sfn|Deakin|2006|p=195}} known as trabeculae.

They are located on the surface of osteon seams and make a [[protein]] mixture known as [[osteoid]], which mineralizes to become bone.{{sfn|Deakin|2006|pp=189\u2013190}} The osteoid seam is a narrow region of newly formed organic matrix, not yet mineralized, located on the surface of a bone. Osteoid is primarily composed of Type I [[collagen]]. Osteoblasts also manufacture [[hormone]]s, such as [[prostaglandin]]s, to act on the bone itself. The osteoblast creates and repairs new bone by actually building around itself. First, the osteoblast puts up [[collagen]] fibers. These collagen fibers are used as a framework for the osteoblasts' work. The osteoblast then deposits calcium phosphate which is hardened by [[hydroxide]] and [[bicarbonate]] ions. The brand new bone created by the osteoblast is called [[osteoid]].<ref>Washington. \"The O' Cells.\" Bone Cells. University of Washington, n.d.

New bone is then formed by the osteoblasts. Bone is constantly [[bone remodeling|remodelled]] by the resorption of osteoclasts and created by osteoblasts.{{sfn|Deakin|2006|p=189}} Osteoclasts are large cells with multiple [[Cell nucleus|nuclei]] located on bone surfaces in what are called ''Howship's lacunae'' (or ''resorption pits'').

This matrix consists of organic components, mainly [[Collagen#Types of collagen|type I collagen]] \u2013 \"organic\" referring to materials produced as a result of the human body \u2013 and inorganic components, primarily [[hydroxyapatite]] and other salts of [[calcium]] and [[phosphate]].

In adults woven bone is created after [[Bone fracture|fractures]] or in [[Paget's disease of bone|Paget's disease]]. Woven bone is weaker, with a smaller number of randomly oriented collagen fibers, but forms quickly; it is for this appearance of the fibrous matrix that the bone is termed ''woven''. It is soon replaced by lamellar bone, which is highly organized in [[concentric]] sheets with a much lower proportion of osteocytes to surrounding tissue. Lamellar bone, which makes its first appearance in humans in the [[fetus]] during the third trimester,<ref name=\"Salentijn\">Salentijn, L. ''Biology of Mineralized Tissues: Cartilage and Bone'', [[Columbia University College of Dental Medicine]] post-graduate dental lecture series, 2007</ref> is stronger and filled with many collagen fibers parallel to other fibers in the same layer (these parallel columns are called osteons).  In [[cross section (geometry)|cross-section]], the fibers run in opposite directions in alternating layers, much like in [[plywood]], assisting in the bone's ability to resist [[torsion (mechanics)|torsion]] forces. After a fracture, woven bone forms initially and is gradually replaced by lamellar bone during a process known as \"bony substitution.\" Compared to woven bone, lamellar bone formation takes place more slowly. The orderly deposition of collagen fibers restricts the formation of osteoid to about 1 to 2&nbsp;[[Micrometre|\u00b5m]] per day. Lamellar bone also requires a relatively flat surface to lay the collagen fibers in parallel or concentric layers.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n{{Clear}}\n\n====Deposition====\n\nThe extracellular matrix of bone is laid down by [[osteoblast]]s, which secrete both collagen and ground substance. These synthesise collagen within the cell, and then secrete collagen fibrils. The collagen fibers rapidly [[polymer]]ise to form collagen strands. At this stage they are not yet mineralised, and are called \"osteoid\". Around the strands calcium and phosphate [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitate]] on the surface of these strands, within days to weeks becoming crystals of hydroxyapatite.{{sfn|Hall|2005|p=981}}\n\nIn order to mineralise the bone, the osteoblasts secrete [[vesicle (biology)|vesicles]] containing [[alkaline phosphatase]]. This cleaves the phosphate groups and acts as the foci for calcium and phosphate deposition. The vesicles then rupture and act as a centre for crystals to grow on.

Other anatomical terms are also used to describe [[Anatomical terms of location|the location of bones]]. Like other anatomical terms, many of these derive from [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]]. Some anatomists still use Latin to refer to bones. The term \"osseous\", and the prefix \"osteo-\", referring to things related to bone, are still used commonly today.\n\nSome examples of terms used to describe bones include the term \"foramen\" to describe a hole through which something passes, and a \"canal\" or \"meatus\" to describe a tunnel-like structure. A protrusion from a bone can be called a number of terms, including a \"condyle\", \"crest\", \"spine\", \"eminence\", \"tubercle\" or \"tuberosity\", depending on the protrusion's shape and location. In general, [[long bone]]s are said to have a \"head\", \"neck\", and \"body\".\n\nWhen two bones join together, they are said to \"articulate\". If the two bones have a fibrous connection and are relatively immobile, then the joint is called a \"suture\".\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Bone growth.png|300px|thumb|left|Endochondral ossification]]\n[[File:Bone (1).jpg|thumb|Section through a juvenile knee joint (rat) showing the cartilagineous growth plates]]\nThe formation of bone is called [[ossification]].

Secondary ossification occurs after birth, and forms the [[Epiphysis|epiphyses]] of long bones and the extremities of irregular and flat bones. The diaphysis and both epiphyses of a long bone are separated by a growing zone of cartilage (the [[epiphyseal plate]]).

Because of the immobilisation, people with fractures are often advised to undergo [[Physical medicine and rehabilitation|rehabilitation]].{{sfn|Britton|2010|pp=1068}}\n\n===Tumours===\n{{main|Bone tumour}}\nThere are several types of tumour that can affect bone; examples of benign [[bone tumour]]s include [[osteoma]], [[osteoid osteoma]], [[osteochondroma]], [[osteoblastoma]], [[enchondroma]], [[giant cell tumour of bone]], and [[aneurysmal bone cyst]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/benign-bone-tumors|title=Benign Bone Tumours|date=2017|website=Cleveland Clinic|access-date=29 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Cancer===\n{{main|Bone metastases}}\n[[Cancer]] can arise in bone tissue, and bones are also a common site for other cancers to spread ([[metastasise]]) to.{{sfn|Britton|2010|pp=1125}} Cancers that arise in bone are called \"primary\" cancers, although such cancers are rare.{{sfn|Britton|2010|pp=1125}} Metastases within bone are \"secondary\" cancers, with the most common being [[breast cancer]], [[lung cancer]], [[prostate cancer]], [[thyroid cancer]], and [[kidney cancer]].{{sfn|Britton|2010|pp=1125}} Secondary cancers that affect bone can either destroy bone (called a \"[[lytic cycle|lytic]]\" cancer) or create bone (a \"[[sclerosis (medicine)|sclerotic]]\" cancer). Cancers of the bone marrow inside the bone can also affect bone tissue, examples including [[leukemia]] and [[multiple myeloma]]. Bone may also be affected by cancers in other parts of the body. Cancers in other parts of the body may release [[parathyroid hormone]] or [[parathyroid hormone-related peptide]]. This increases bone reabsorption, and can lead to bone fractures.\n\nBone tissue that is destroyed or altered as a result of cancers is distorted, weakened, and more prone to fracture. This may lead to compression of the [[spinal cord]], destruction of the marrow resulting in [[bruising]], [[bleeding]] and [[immunosuppression]], and is one cause of bone pain. If the cancer is metastatic, then there might be other symptoms depending on the site of the original cancer. Some bone cancers can also be felt.\n\nCancers of the bone are managed according to their type, their [[cancer staging|stage]], prognosis, and what symptoms they cause. Many primary cancers of bone are treated with [[radiotherapy]]. Cancers of bone marrow may be treated with [[chemotherapy]], and other forms of targeted therapy such as [[immunotherapy]] may be used.{{sfn|Britton|2010|pp=1032}} [[Palliative care]], which focuses on maximising a person's [[quality of life]], may play a role in management, particularly if the likelihood of [[5-year survival|survival within five years]] is poor.\n\n===Painful conditions===\n* [[Osteomyelitis]] is inflammation of the bone or bone marrow due to bacterial infection.\n*[[Osteomalacia]] is a painful softening of adult bone caused by severe vitamin D deficiency.\n* [[Osteogenesis imperfecta]]\n* [[Osteochondritis dissecans]]\n* [[Ankylosing spondylitis]]\n* [[Skeletal fluorosis]] is a bone disease caused by an excessive accumulation of [[fluoride]] in the bones.

Also, an independent documentary called ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'' was released on October 19, 2010. It mostly focused on ''Psycho II'', ''Psycho III'' and ''Psycho IV: The Beginning'', but did cover the impact and legacy of the original film. \n\nThe films focus on the life of [[Norman Bates]], a deeply disturbed young man who operates the Bates Motel. He is mentally unstable from a domineering relationship with his mother, which results in him having a psychotic twisted personality and, as a result, he occasionally kills people.\n\nA five-season TV series, ''[[Bates Motel (TV series)|Bates Motel]]'', aired on [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]] between 2013 and 2017.

It was loosely based on the Wisconsin serial killer and cannibal [[Ed Gein]]. Author [[Robert Bloch]] lived 40 miles away from Gein's farmhouse and liked the idea of somebody being able to kill people in a small community and get away with it for years without being caught. The character of [[Norman Bates]] was very different in the novel from in [[Psycho (1960 film)|the film version]]. In the novel, Bates is overweight, in his early 40s and drinks heavily. When [[Joseph Stefano]] adapted the novel into the screenplay, he made the character of Norman young, attractive and vulnerable.\n\n===''Psycho II'' (1982)===\n{{Main|Psycho II (novel)}}\nIn 1982, Bloch wrote a sequel novel called ''Psycho II'' which had nothing to do with the [[Psycho II (film)|1983 film version]]. In the novel, Norman Bates escapes the mental institution and goes to Hollywood to stop the production of a film based on his life. Many critics and fans described the novel as being silly and weird and couldn't have possibly been made into a film.\n\n===''Psycho House'' (1990)===\n{{Main|Psycho House}}\nIn 1990, due to the pressure from his publishing company, Bloch wrote a third novel called ''Psycho House''. However, according to horror writer [[David J. Schow]], when writing it Bloch originally called it ''Psycho 13''.

While en route to Sam's [[California]] home, she parks along the road to sleep. A highway patrol officer awakens her and, suspicious of her agitation, follows her. When she trades her car for another at a dealership, he notes the new vehicle's details. Marion returns to the road but, rather than drive in a heavy storm, decides to spend the night at the Bates Motel.  The proprietor, [[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]), tells Marion he rarely has customers because of the motel's disconnection from a new [[Interstate highway system|Interstate]] and mentions he lives with [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|his mother]] in the house overlooking the motel. He invites Marion to supper. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother about letting Marion in the house, and during the meal, she angers him by suggesting he institutionalize his mother. He admits he would like this, but does not want to abandon her.\n\nMarion resolves to return to Phoenix to return the money. After calculating how she can repay the money she has spent, Marion dumps her notes down the toilet and begins to shower. An anonymous female figure enters the bathroom and stabs her to death. Finding the corpse, Norman is horrified. He places Marion's body, wrapped in the shower curtain, and all her possessions &mdash; including the money &mdash; in the trunk of her car and sinks it in a nearby swamp.\n\nShortly afterward, Sam is contacted by both Marion's sister [[Lila Crane]] ([[Vera Miles]]) and private detective Milton Arbogast ([[Martin Balsam]]), who has been hired by Marion's employer to recover the money. Arbogast traces Marion to the motel and questions Norman, who unconvincingly lies that Marion stayed for one night and left the following morning. He refuses to let Arbogast talk to his mother, claiming she is ill. Arbogast calls Lila to update her and tells her he will call again after he questions Norman's mother.\n\nArbogast enters Norman's house and at the top of the stairs is attacked by a figure who slashes his face with a knife, pushes him down the stairs, then stabs him to death. When Arbogast does not call Lila, she and Sam contact the local police. Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers ([[John McIntire]]) is perplexed to learn Arbogast saw a woman in a window since Norman's mother died ten years ago. Norman confronts his mother and urges her to hide in the cellar. She rejects the idea and orders him out of her room, but against her will, Norman carries her to the cellar.\n\nPosing as a married couple, Sam and Lila check into the motel and search Marion's room, where they find a scrap of paper in the toilet with \"$40,000\" written on it. While Sam distracts Norman, Lila sneaks into the house. Sam suggests to Norman that he killed Marion for the money so he could buy a new hotel. Realizing Lila is not around, Norman knocks Sam unconscious and rushes to the house. Lila sees him and hides in the cellar where she discovers the semi-preserved and [[mummy|mummified]] body of Norman's mother. Wearing his mother's clothes and a wig and carrying a knife, Norman enters and tries to attack Lila, but she is rescued by Sam.\n\nAfter Norman's arrest, [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] Dr. Richmond ([[Simon Oakland]]) tells Sam and Lila that Norman's dead mother is living in Norman's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as an [[dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]]. After the death of Norman's father, the pair lived as if they were the only people in the world. When his mother found a lover, Norman went mad with jealousy and murdered them both. Consumed with guilt, Norman \"erased the crime\" by bringing his mother back to life in his mind. He stole her corpse and preserved the body. When he was \"Mother\", he acted, talked, and dressed as she would. The psychiatrist concludes that the \"Mother\" personality now has complete control of Norman's mind.\n\nIn the final scene, Norman sits in a cell, thinking in \"Mother's\" voice. In a voiceover, \"Mother\" explains that she plans to prove that she is incapable of violence by refusing to swat a fly that has landed on her hand. The final shot shows Marion's car being recovered from the swamp.\n\n===''Psycho II'' (1983)===\n{{Main|Psycho II (film)}}\n[[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) is released from a mental institution after 22 years. [[Lila Crane|Lila Loomis]] ([[Vera Miles]]), the sister of Bates' victim [[Marion Crane]] and widow of the now-deceased Sam Loomis, vehemently protests with a petition that she has been circulating with signatures of 743 people, including the relatives of the six people Norman killed prior to his incarceration, but her plea is dismissed. Norman is taken to his old home, the Bates Motel, with the house behind it on the hill, by Dr. Bill Raymond ([[Robert Loggia]]), who assures him everything will be fine. He is introduced to the motel's new manager, Warren Toomey ([[Dennis Franz]]). The following day, Norman reports to a pre-arranged job at a nearby diner, run by a kindly old lady named [[Emma Spool]] ([[Claudia Bryar]]). One of his co-workers there is Mary Loomis ([[Meg Tilly]]), a young waitress. Mary claims she has been thrown out of her boyfriend's place and needs a place to stay. Norman offers to let her stay at the motel, then extends the offer to his home when he discovers that Toomey has turned his beloved establishment into a sleazy adult motel.\n\nNorman's adjustment back into society appears to be going along well until \"Mother\" begins to make her presence known. Norman gets mysterious notes from \"Mother\" at the house and diner. Phone calls come from someone claiming to be Norman's mother. Toomey picks a fight at the diner after Norman fires him. Later, a figure in a black dress stabs Toomey to death with a kitchen knife as he is packing to leave the motel. Norman begins to doubt his sanity when he begins hearing voices in the house. He enters his mother's bedroom to find it looks exactly as it did 22 years ago. A sound lures him to the attic, where he is locked in. Believing the house to be abandoned, a teenage couple sneaks in through the cellar window. They notice a female figure pacing in the next room. As they try to climb out, the boy is stabbed to death. The girl escapes and alerts the police. Mary eventually finds Norman in the attic. Sheriff Hunt ([[Hugh Gillin]]) questions them about the boy's murder. He finds the cellar neat and orderly. Norman is about to admit that something suspicious is going on, but Mary claims that she has cleaned up the basement herself. After the sheriff leaves, Norman asks Mary why she lied. She explains that she had to save him from being arrested. Norman collapses into the chair with his head in his hands and moans, \"It's starting again!\"\n\nMary is startled later when she discovers someone looking at her through a peephole in the bathroom wall. She calls out to Norman, who is downstairs and out of reach. The two are horrified to find a bloody cloth that has been stuffed down the toilet. Norman appears confused and believes he may have committed another murder. Mary goes down to check the motel. In the parlor she is surprised by Lila, who reveals herself to be Mary's mother. She has been calling Norman claiming to be his mother, even going so far as to dress up as her and allowing him to see her in the window. Mary has been helping her. She was responsible for restoring Mother's room at the house and locking Norman in the attic. All of this was an attempt to drive Norman insane again and have him recommitted.\n\nMary's growing feelings for Norman, however, have been preying on her conscience leaving her to reconsider her actions. Meanwhile, Dr. Raymond discovers Mary's identity as Lila's daughter and informs Norman. He also orders the corpse of Norma Bates (which was buried in a proper grave after the events of the original film) to be exhumed, to prove that Norman isn't being haunted by his mother. Mary admits to Norman that she has been part of Lila's ruse, and that while she now refuses to continue, Lila won't stop. Mary goes to Lila's hotel and their argument is overheard by a bartender. Later, Lila drives over to Norman's house, unaware that Dr. Raymond is watching her from the Bates Motel as she sneaks into the cellar. While removing her \"Mother\" costume from a loose stone in the floor, another figure dressed as \"Mother\" steps out of the shadows and murders her. Dr. Raymond runs up to the house. Lila's body is not in the cellar.\n\nMeanwhile, Mary discovers that a car has been retrieved from the swamp, with Toomey's body in the trunk. Realizing the police will shortly arrive to arrest Norman, Mary returns to warn him. The phone rings in the house, Norman answers, and starts speaking to his \"mother\". Mary listens in and discovers that nobody is on the line with Norman. Terrified, Mary runs downstairs into the cellar, and quickly dresses up as Mother to confront Norman. Someone grabs her from behind, and she plunges the butcher knife into ... Dr. Raymond, who has sneaked back into the house. A stunned Mary runs downstairs and is confronted by a deranged Norman, who promises to cover up for \"Mother\". Mary tries to keep him away, repeatedly stabbing him in the hands and chest. He backs Mary into the fruit cellar to hide and slips on a pile of coal, which avalanches away from the wall, revealing Lila's body hidden behind it. Mary is now convinced that Norman had been committing the murders. She raises her knife to stab him and is shot to death by the incoming police. The sheriff inaccurately believes Lila and Mary committed all the murders.\n\nThat evening, a woman walks up the steps to the Bates' mansion. Bandaged from his injuries, Norman has set a place for dinner when he hears a knock at the door. It is Emma Spool, the kindly woman from the diner. Norman gives her a cup of tea. Mrs. Spool tells him that she is his real mother, that Mrs. Bates was her sister, who adopted Norman as an infant while Mrs. Spool was institutionalized. She further reveals that she was the murderer, having killed anybody who tried to harm her son. As she sips the tea, Norman kills her with a sudden blow to the head with a shovel. Norman is now completely insane again. He carries Mrs. Spool's body upstairs to Mother's room and we hear Mother's voice warn Norman not to play with \"filthy girls\". Norman reopens the Bates Motel and stands in front of the house, waiting for new customers as Mother watches from the window upstairs.\n\n===''Psycho III'' (1986)===\n{{Main|Psycho III}}\nMaureen Coyle ([[Diana Scarwid]]), a mentally unstable young nun, is on top of a bell tower about to commit suicide. When another nun tries to get her to come down, Maureen accidentally pushes her over the railing to her death. Another nun tells Maureen that she will burn in hell. She is forced to leave the convent after this ordeal.\n\n[[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) is still manning the desk at the Bates Motel and living with the preserved corpse of his real mother, [[Emma Spool]] ([[Claudia Bryar]]), whom Norman killed at the end of ''Psycho II''. Local law enforcement and Norman's ex-boss Ralph Statler ([[Robert Alan Browne]]) are concerned since Mrs. Spool has been missing for over a month. Duane Duke ([[Jeff Fahey]]), a sleazy musician desperate for money, is offered the job of assistant manager at the Bates Motel. Maureen, now the new long-term tenant, has some issues to resolve in her life. She gave up her vows as a nun only days before, and she isn't sure just how she feels about either spiritual or earthly matters.\n\nSheriff John Hunt ([[Hugh Gillin]]) and Statler have a conversation at the diner, when Tracy Venable ([[Roberta Maxwell]]), a pushy journalist from Los Angeles, interrupts them. She is working on an article about serial killers being put back on the streets. Venable is trying to back up her theory that Norman is back to his old ways again. Norman appears and Venable jumps at the chance to talk with him. Unaware of her ulterior motives Norman opens up to her, but is distracted when an exhausted Maureen enters and sits at the lunch counter. He is startled by Maureen's presence, because he feels she strongly resembles [[Marion Crane]]. Seeing the initials \"M.C.\" on her suitcase, Norman freaks out and leaves the diner. After a conversation with \"Mother\", Norman spies on Maureen as she undresses and heads into the bathroom to take a shower. Keeping \"her\" word, \"Mother\" enters Maureen's motel room with plans to kill her. Upon pulling back the shower curtain, it is revealed Maureen has attempted suicide by cutting her wrists, a sight which snaps Norman back to his \"normal\" side. Maureen looks up at \"Mother\" who is so weakened by what \"she\" sees, \"she\" lowers the knife. Due to blood loss, Maureen hallucinates and she mistakes Norman, dressed up as \"Mother\", for the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] holding a silver crucifix.\n\nMeanwhile, Tracy has met with Duane at a bar where they discuss Norman, and it seems Tracy blames Norman for Mrs. Spool's disappearance. When she leaves, Duane picks up another girl at the bar, Red ([[Juliette Cummins]]). Norman gets Maureen to the local hospital to save her life. After she is released, he invites her to stay back at the motel and they begin a romantic relationship. The same night, Duane and Red arrive at the motel and hear an argument between \"Mother\" and Norman, but think it's just a TV turned up too loud. Red and Duane, head to cabin 12 where they make love. Later that night, Red, makes it clear she wants more than just a fling. Calling him a pig, they argue. Duane, infuriated, throws her out of the cabin. Red heads down to the payphone to call a cab, where she realizes she is wearing her blouse backwards. As she takes it off to put it on the right way, \"Mother\" shatters the phone booth door and stabs a trapped Red to death. The next morning, Duane finds Norman scrubbing down the phone booth.\n\nA group from out of town arrive at the motel where they plan to watch the local [[American football|football]] game. Tracy comes to find Norman and ask questions about his past and \"Mother\". Norman becomes defensive with the reporter and tells her to leave, never to return. Later that night, he and Maureen go to a restaurant, where they dance and talk romantically, while Tracy searches Mrs. Spool's apartment. She discovers the Bates Motel's telephone number written on a magazine cover. Norman and Maureen return to the motel to find most of the other guests engaged in drunken stupor. Norman goes with Maureen to her room and they fall asleep in each other's arms having refused to make love. Some time afterwards, Patsy Boyle (Katt Shea Ruben), the only sober guest, wakes up Maureen to ensure her safety as Norman had left the door open, a bad idea with all the drunken guests around. Patsy, needing to use the bathroom, finds the one in Norman's parlor unoccupied, but \"Mother\" again emerges and slashes her throat. Norman (an homage to the reaction of finding Marion dead in the shower in the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'') gasps when he discovers Patsy's body. He buries her in the motel's ice chest outside the office.\n\nThe next morning, Sheriff Hunt and Deputy Leo appear at Norman's house to investigate Patsy's disappearance. Norman tries to prevent Hunt from entering his mother's bedroom, when he discovers that \"Mother\"/Mrs. Spool has disappeared completely. Outside, Tracy tells Maureen about Norman, and she, rather upset, leaves the motel and goes to stay with Father Brian (Gary Bayer), who took care of her at the hospital. Meanwhile, Tracy is convinced Norman is behind the latest disappearances. Norman searches for his mother all over the house and finds a note from her stating that she is in cabin 12. When Norman arrives at the cabin, he learns it was Duane who took \"Mother\". Duane confronts him then attempts to blackmail Norman into paying him off, or he'll turn Norman into the police. He tells Duane he doesn't have that kind of money, but Duane reminds him that Norman has made a lot of cash from his business, and if Norman doesn't give money for his silence, he will go to the police. He agrees to Duane's blackmail demands, but he then unexpectedly throws an ashtray at Duane's head. They fight and Norman seemingly kills Duane by hitting him several times with his own guitar. Terrified of what he has done, he blames \"Mother\" for this.\n\nTracy talks to Statler and Myrna ([[Lee Garlington]]) about Mrs. Spool and discovers she was working at the diner before Statler bought it from Harvey Leach. Tracy meets with Leach, a resident at an assisted living facility, and is informed that Mrs. Spool had also once been institutionalized for murder. Meanwhile, Norman drives Duane's car to the swamp with Duane and Patsy's bodies in it. Duane turns out to be alive and attacks Norman, who accidentally drives the car into the swamp. He struggles out of the car while Duane drowns. Tracy reads some old newspapers at her study and discovers about the \"Bates kidnapping\".\n\nMaureen convinces herself that Norman is her true love. She returns to the motel and takes a shower before visiting Norman at his house. They share a tender moment at the top of the staircase when \"Mother\" shouts furiously at Norman, which startles him and causes him to lose grip on Maureen's hands. She falls down the stairs into the Cupid statue at the base of the stairs. She goes limp and sinks to the floor revealing the arrow had punctured her skull. Distraught, Norman screams and confronts his mother, saying that he will get her for this. \"You don't have the guts, boy!\" declares \"Mother\".\n\nAt that moment, Tracy arrives at the motel and tries to find Maureen. She enters the house only to find her lying dead on the couch of the living room which is filled with lit candles. Then she sees Norman dressed as \"Mother\", holding a knife, and tries to flee. She tries to reason with Norman by explaining his family history: Emma Spool, who ''was'' in fact his aunt, was in love with Norman's father, but he married her sister, Norma, instead. Mrs. Spool, having serious psychological problems, kidnapped Norman when he was a baby after she killed Mr. Bates, believing Norman was the child \"she should have had with him.\" She discovers Mrs. Spool's corpse in the bedroom, and Norman takes off his mother's dress. \"Mother\" orders him to kill Tracy, and when Norman raises the knife, he instead brutally attacks \"Mother,\" dismembering her preserved remains. The last scene shows Sheriff Hunt taking Norman to his squad car, with Father Brian and Tracy following behind. Hunt informs Norman that they may never let him out of the institution again, Norman replies, \"But I'll be free... I'll finally be free.\" Norman, sitting silently in the back of the squad car on the way to the institution, enjoys his victory over his mother by caressing a trophy: the severed hand of Mrs. Spool. He smiles sardonically as the screen fades to black and the credits roll.\n\n===''Bates Motel'' (1987)===\n{{main|Bates Motel (film)}}\nA [[television film|made-for-television]] [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] film. Alex West ([[Bud Cort]]) is a mentally disturbed youth who was admitted to an asylum for killing his abusive stepfather. At the asylum, he roomed with [[Norman Bates]] ([[Kurt Paul]]) and they eventually became close friends. Years later, Norman dies and Alex learns that he has inherited the Bates Motel. He travels to Norman's California hometown (renamed Fairville for this film; in the original film it was Fairvale) and with a little help from teenage runaway Willie ([[Lori Petty]]) and local handyman Henry Watson ([[Moses Gunn]]), Alex struggles to re-open the motel for business, until rumors about the place being haunted by the ghost of Norman's mother, [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|Mrs. Bates]], are apparently true. Only to find that the haunting was a prank and the ghost was the bank manager, Tom Fuller ([[Gregg Henry]]), who refused to give Alex a loan by trying to scare him away. Tom is then forced to help Alex and the others with renovating the motel or face prison for fraud. The motel was soon finished with the renovation.\n\nMeanwhile, Barbara Peters ([[Kerrie Keane]]) runs away from home and ends up staying in Alex's motel for the night, contemplating suicide for getting older, going through three divorces, and not having children. Barbara meets a teenage girl ([[Khrystyne Haje]]), who invites Barbara to dance at an after prom party in the motel with her and her teenage friends, including Tony Scotti ([[Jason Bateman]]), though Barbara felt uncomfortable hanging with young kids. It is then revealed that Barbara's real name is Sally, and that the teenage girl is her younger self from an alternate dimension who took her own life and is now trapped in \"the other side\", along with Tony, and other teens who also committed suicide. Sally tells Barbara that she has a life worth living for, then Sally leaves with the rest of the group. Barbara leaves the motel the next day, planning to live her life to the fullest. Alex looks at the screen telling viewers, \"If you ever need a room, come by. I can't say for sure what you'll find, but it is what makes the world go around.\"\n\n===''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' (1990)===\n{{Main|Psycho IV: The Beginning}}\nFran Ambrose ([[CCH Pounder]]) is a radio talk show host who is talking on the topic of \"matricide\" (when children kill their mothers) with guest Dr. Richmond ([[Warren Frost]]), who was [[Norman Bates]]' former psychologist. The radio receives a call from Norman Bates ([[Anthony Perkins]]), who has re-entered society and married his former psychiatrist, Connie (Donna Mitchell). Under the alias of \"Ed\" (possibly a reference to Ed Gein, the killer after whom the character of Norman was modeled), Norman tells his story, which the audience sees as a series of flashbacks set in the 1940s and 1950s. Some flashbacks are [[Reverse chronology|slightly out of order]]. The chronological story is: In 1950, Norman's mother, [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|Norma Bates]] ([[Olivia Hussey]]) had schizophrenia (see ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]''); she was smothering Norman and would have violent mood swings. Due to Norman's sexual repression at her hands, when she was frolicking with him he had an incestuous erection, causing her to dress him in women's clothing and taunt him by calling him \"Norma.\" She then got engaged to a man named Chet Rudolph (Thomas Schuster), who would beat up Norman. Eventually Norman got fed up with her allowing Chet to be in their lives and poisoned them both, albeit reluctantly. He then developed his infamous multiple personality disorder and stole her corpse to create the illusion that she was alive - whenever her corpse spoke to him, the \"Norma\" personality would take over. This caused Norman as \"Norma\" to kill two women who wanted to have sex with him.\n\nThroughout the spaces in the flashbacks, Dr. Richmond realizes \"Ed\" is Norman and tries to convince Fran to trace the calls. Richmond's worries are dismissed because they cannot trace the call and they believe they can talk Norman out of the reason he called: he fears he will kill again. He tells Fran that Connie got pregnant against his wishes and that he does not want another \"monster\". He then tells Fran he does believe his mother is dead, but he will kill Connie \"with my own hands, just like the first time\". He then takes Connie to his mother's house and attempts to kill her, but after Connie reassures Norman that their child will not be a monster, he drops his knife in shame and Connie forgives him. He then burns the house where all his unhappiness began. As he tries to escape the flames, he hallucinates that he sees his victims, Chet, his mother and eventually himself preserving her corpse. He and Connie leave the scene with Norman stating, \"I'm free.\"  However, as the credits roll, the sound of his newborn baby crying can be heard.\n\n===''Psycho'' (1998)===\n{{Main|Psycho (1998 film)}}\nIn need of money to get her boyfriend Sam Loomis ([[Viggo Mortensen]]) out of debt, [[Marion Crane]] ([[Anne Heche]]) steals $400,000 from her employer and flees [[Phoenix, Arizona]] by car. While en route to Sam's [[California]] home, she parks along the road to sleep. A highway patrol officer awakens her and, suspicious of her agitated state, begins to follow her. When she trades her car for another one at a dealership, he notes the new vehicle's details. Marion returns to the road but, rather than drive in a heavy storm, decides to spend the night at the Bates Motel.  The proprietor, [[Norman Bates]] ([[Vince Vaughn]]), tells Marion he rarely has customers because of a new interstate nearby and mentions he lives with his mother in the house overlooking the motel. He invites Marion to have supper with him. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother about letting Marion in the house, and during the meal she angers him by suggesting he institutionalize his mother. He admits he would like to do so, but does not want to abandon her.\n\nMarion resolves to return to Phoenix to return the money. After calculating how she can repay the money she has spent, Marion dumps her notes down the toilet and begins to shower. An anonymous female figure enters the bathroom and stabs her to death. Finding the corpse, Norman is horrified. He cleans the bathroom and places Marion's body, wrapped in the shower curtain, and all her possessions &mdash; including the money &mdash; in the trunk of her car and sinks it in a nearby swamp...\n\nShortly afterward, Sam is contacted by both Marion's sister [[Lila Crane]] ([[Julianne Moore]]) and private detective Milton Arbogast ([[William H. Macy]]), who has been hired by Marion's employer to find her and recover the money. Arbogast traces Marion to the motel and questions Norman, who unconvincingly lies that Marion stayed for one night and left the following morning. He refuses to let Arbogast talk to his mother, claiming she is ill. Arbogast calls Lila to update her and tells her he will contact her again within an hour after he questions Norman's mother.\n\nArbogast enters Norman's house and at the top of the stairs is attacked by a figure who slashes his face three times with a knife, pushes him down the stairs, then stabs him to death. When Arbogast does not call Lila, she and Sam contact the local police. Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers ([[Philip Baker Hall]]) is perplexed to learn Arbogast saw a woman in a window, since Norman's mother died ten years ago. Norman confronts his mother and urges her to hide in the cellar. She rejects the idea and orders him out of her room, but against her will Norman carries her to the cellar.\n\nPosing as a married couple, Sam and Lila check into the motel and search Marion's room, where they find a scrap of paper in the toilet with \"$400,000\" written on it. While Sam distracts Norman, Lila sneaks into the house to search for his mother. Sam suggests to Norman that he killed Marion for the money so he could buy a new motel. Realizing Lila is not around, Norman knocks Sam unconscious with a golf club and rushes to the house. Lila sees him and hides in the cellar where she discovers the semi-preserved and [[mummy|mummified]] body of Norman's mother. Wearing his mother's clothes and a wig and carrying a knife, Norman enters and tries to attack Lila, but she is rescued by Sam.\n\nAfter Norman's arrest, [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] Dr. Fred Richmond ([[Robert Forster]]) tells Sam and Lila that Norman's dead mother is living in Norman's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as an [[dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]]. After the death of Norman's father, the pair lived as if they were the only people in the world. When his mother found a lover, Norman went over the edge with jealousy and murdered both of them. Consumed with guilt, he tried to \"erase the crime\" by bringing his mother back to life in his mind. He stole her corpse and preserved the body. When he is \"Mother\", he acts, talks, and dresses as she would. Norman imagined his mother would be as jealous of a woman to whom he might be attracted just as he was of his mother's lover, and so \"Mother\" kills any woman he has feelings for; when Norman regains consciousness, he believes that his mother has committed the crime, and covers up for her. It is implied that Norman is responsible for the unsolved disappearances of two young girls. Richmond concludes that the \"Mother\" personality has now taken complete control of Norman's mind.\n\nIn the final scene, Norman sits in a cell, thinking in \"Mother's\" voice. In a voiceover, \"Mother\" explains that she plans to prove to the authorities she is incapable of violence by refusing to swat a fly that has landed on her hand. The final shot shows Marion's car being recovered from the swamp, and then goes to end credits.\n\n==Television series==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" |Series\n! scope=\"col\" |Seasons\n! scope=\"col\" |Episodes\n! scope=\"col\" |First aired\n! scope=\"col\" |Last aired\n! scope=\"col\" |Showrunner(s)\n! scope=\"col\" |Network\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | ''[[Bates Motel (TV series)|Bates Motel]]''\n| 5\n| 50\n| March 18, 2013 \n| April 24, 2017\n| [[Carlton Cuse]], [[Kerry Ehrin]], [[Anthony Cipriano]]\n| [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]]\n|-\n|}\n\n===''Bates Motel'' (2013\u20132017)===\n{{Main|Bates Motel (TV series)}}\nOn January 23, 2012, A&E announced that a television series called ''Bates Motel'' was in development at the network.

Both had deceased, domineering mothers, and had sealed off one room of their house as a shrine to their mother, and both dressed in women's clothing. However, there are many differences between Bates and Ed Gein. Among others, Gein would not be strictly considered a serial killer, having officially killed \"only\" two people.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reavill|2007|p=228}} \"With only two confirmed kills, Ed did not technically qualify as a serial killer (the traditional minimum requirement was three\"</ref> [[Peggy Robertson]], Hitchcock's production assistant, read [[Anthony Boucher]]'s positive review of the Bloch novel and decided to show the book to Hitchcock, even though readers at Hitchcock's home studio [[Paramount Pictures]] rejected its premise for a film. Hitchcock acquired rights to the novel for $9,500.<ref name=\"Leigh6\">Leigh, p. 6</ref> He reportedly ordered Robertson to buy up copies to keep the novel's surprises for the film.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=19\u201320}}</ref> Hitchcock chose to film ''Psycho'' to recover from two aborted projects with Paramount: ''Flamingo Feather'' and ''No Bail for the Judge''. Hitchcock also faced genre competitors whose works were critically compared to his own and so wanted to film new material. The director also disliked stars' salary demands and trusted only a few people to choose prospective material, including Robertson.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=18\u201319}}</ref>\n\nParamount executives did not want to produce the film and refused to provide the budget that Hitchcock received from them for previous films with the studio.<ref name=\"Rebello23\">{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|p=23}}</ref> Hitchcock decided to plan for ''Psycho'' to be filmed quickly and inexpensively, similar to an episode of his ongoing television series ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', and hired the television series crew as Shamley Productions. He proposed this cost-conscious approach to Paramount but executives again refused to finance the film, telling him their sound stages were occupied or booked even though production was known to be in a slump. Hitchcock countered with the offer to finance the film personally and to film it at Universal-International if Paramount would distribute. He also deferred his director's fee of $250,000 for a 60% ownership of the film negative. This offer was finally accepted. Hitchcock also experienced resistance from producer Herbert Coleman and Shamley Productions executive [[Joan Harrison (screenwriter)|Joan Harrison]], who did not think the film would be a success.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=26\u201329}}</ref>\n\nHitchcock hired writer James Cavanaugh to write a draft of the screenplay. Unsatisfied with Cavanaugh's screenplay, Hitchcock then hired up-and-coming writer [[Joseph Stefano]] to adapt the novel. The film began shooting in December 1959 and would go on to last about a month. It was filmed mostly on the backlot of Universal and in various sound stages. During shooting, Hitchcock was forced to uncharacteristically do retakes for some scenes. The final shot in the shower scene, which starts with an extreme close-up on Marion's eye and pulls up and out, proved very difficult for Leigh, since the water splashing in her face made her want to blink, and the cameraman had trouble as well since he had to manually focus while moving the camera. Retakes were also required for the opening scene, since Hitchcock felt that Leigh and Gavin were not passionate enough.<ref>Leigh, p. 55</ref> Leigh had trouble saying \"Not inordinately\" for the real estate office scene, requiring additional retakes.<ref>Leigh, p. 59</ref> Lastly, the scene in which the mother is discovered required complicated coordination of the chair turning around, Miles hitting the light bulb, and a [[lens flare]], which proved to be the sticking point. Hitchcock forced retakes until all three elements were to his satisfaction.<ref>Leigh, pp. 87\u201388</ref> The famous shower scene took a week to complete and took up a third of Janet Leigh's shooting time. ''Psycho'' was released on June 16, 1960 to mixed critical reception and financial success, making thirty-two million dollars in its theatrical run. The film received four Academy Award nominations.\n\nIn 1982, author Robert Bloch published his novel ''Psycho II'', which satirized Hollywood slasher films. Upset by this, Universal decided to make their own version that differed from Bloch's work.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://mgpfeff.home.sprynet.com/leming_interview1.html | title=Interviews - From ''Psycho'' to ''Asylum'': The Horror Films of Robert Bloch | work=The Unofficial Robert Bloch Website | accessdate=2009-08-15}}</ref> Originally, the film was intended as a [[TV movie|made-for-cable]] production.<ref name=boys>[http://retroslashers.net/blog/a-boys-best-friend-pt2-psycho-2-1983/ A Boy's Best Friend - Psycho 2 - Retroslashers.net] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130112034832/http://retroslashers.net/blog/a-boys-best-friend-pt2-psycho-2-1983/ |date=2013-01-12 }}</ref> [[Anthony Perkins]] originally turned down the offer to reprise the role of [[Norman Bates]], but when the studio became interested in others (including [[Christopher Walken]]), Perkins quickly accepted.<ref name=film>[http://www.film.com/movies/psycho-ii/story/erics-time-capsule-psycho-ii/28477842 Eric's Time Capsule: Psycho II (June 3, 1983) - Film.com]</ref> The studio also wanted [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] (daughter of ''Psycho'' star [[Janet Leigh]]) to play the role of Mary Loomis.<ref name=film/> Director [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]] was hired to direct ''Psycho II'' because he was a Hitchcock student and even visited him on the set of ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]'', and because a year earlier, Franklin made a film called ''[[Roadgames]]'' starring Jamie Lee Curtis which was influenced by Hitchcock's 1954 film ''[[Rear Window]]''. Franklin hired writer [[Tom Holland (director)|Tom Holland]] to write the screenplay after Franklin had seen ''The Beast Within'', which Holland had written. Holland stated: \"I approached it with more trepidation because I was doing a sequel to ''Psycho'' and I had an overwhelming respect for Hitchcock. You didn't want to mess it up, you really had almost a moral obligation to make something that stayed true to the original and yet updated it the same time. It really was the next step, what happens when Norman gets out\". The assistant director of the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', [[Hilton A. Green]], was contacted and asked if he wanted to produce the film. Green, fearing that Hitchcock may not have approved of sequels to his films, called Hitchcock's daughter [[Patricia Hitchcock]] and asked what she thought of the film. Patricia Hitchcock gave her blessing to the film, saying that her father would have loved it. ''Psycho II'' was filmed at [[Universal Studios]] in [[Universal City, California]] on Stage 24 from June 30, 1982 to August 1982.<ref name=boys/>\n\nThe Bates house set was still standing from 1960, but the motel had to be reconstructed.<ref name=boys/> According to [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]], filming lasted 32 days. The film was made much like the first film; it was mostly shot on the backlot of Universal and on a number of sound stages. Several props and set pieces from the original film were found by set designers [[John W. Corso]] and Julie Fletcher. The town of Fairvale (seen when Lila Loomis is tailed by Dr. Raymond) is actually [[Courthouse Square]], which is located on the Universal Studios backlot in [[California]]. Both Franklin and Holland wanted the film to be a tribute to Hitchcock and the original film; to accomplish this, they added in various in jokes such as the scene when Mary and Norman first go into Norman's mother's room, before they turn the lights on; one can see Alfred Hitchcock's silhouette on the wall to the far right. Franklin also repeated various shots from the original film such as the shot where Norman walks into the kitchen and sets his jacket down on the chair. Perkins had difficulty working with actress [[Meg Tilly]] due to Tilly never seeing the original film and not being aware of the significance of Perkins' comeback role. Midway through production, Perkins suggested that Tilly be replaced even though half of her scenes had been shot. The ending of the film was kept secret during production. The final pages of the shooting script with the ending on it weren't distributed to cast and crew until the last day of filming. The iconic last shot of the movie with Norman standing in front of the house was used as a Christmas card for various crew members. When Universal presented concept art for the one-sheet film poster, director Franklin wasn't pleased with it. It was editor Andrew London who came up with the idea of using the Christmas card photo as the film poster and also came up with the tagline: \"It's 22 years later and Norman Bates is coming home\". When the film opened on June 3, 1983, it earned $8,310,244 in its opening weekend and went on to gross about $34,725,000, making it one of the top hits of the year, just behind ''[[Return of the Jedi]]''.<ref name=boys/>\n\n''Psycho II'' was generally received well by the public and critics and was a surprise box office success. However, film critics [[Gene Siskel]] and [[Roger Ebert]] both gave the film thumbs down on ''[[At the Movies (1982\u20131990 TV series)|At the Movies]]'', specifically for its failure to live up to the original. \"I think the ghost of the original,\" said Siskel, \"obviously hangs over this movie, and it's too bad because it's a nicely made picture.\" Ebert wrote of the film: \"If you've seen ''Psycho'' a dozen times and can recite the shots in the shower scene by heart, ''Psycho II'' is just not going to do it for you. But if you can accept this 1983 movie on its own terms, as a fresh start, and put your memories of Hitchcock on hold, then ''Psycho II'' begins to work. It's too heavy on plot and too willing to cheat about its plot to be really successful, but it does have its moments, and it's better than your average, run-of-the-mill slasher movie.\"<ref name=\"ebert\">{{Cite news|author=Ebert, Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |title=Psycho (1960) |work=Great Movies |publisher=rogerebert.com |date=1998-12-06 |url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19981206/REVIEWS08/401010353/1023|accessdate=2006-12-01}}</ref> In the British magazine ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'', film critic [[Kim Newman]] gave the film three out of five stars, calling ''Psycho II'' \"a smart, darkly-comic thriller with some imaginative twists\", writing \" The wittiest dark joke is that the entire world ''wants'' Norman to be mad, and \u2018normality\u2019 can only be restored if he\u2019s got a mummified mother in the window and is ready to kill again.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Newman|first=Kim|title=Empire's Psycho II Movie Review|url=https://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=134907|publisher=Empire|accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nWith the surprise financial and critical success of ''Psycho II'', Universal began development on a second sequel. Writer [[Charles Edward Pogue]] was hired to write the screenplay. In Pogue's first draft of the film, it was Duane who was the killer and had intentionally come to the Bates Motel because he was obsessed with Norman. Maureen was a neurotic psychologist who had come to the motel to replace Dr. Raymond from the previous film. Pogue had intended to cast original victim [[Janet Leigh]] in the role. Universal rejected these ideas, arguing that Bates had to be the killer and Leigh was wrong for the film. However, Maureen's actions remained virtually unchanged; her character was merely changed to a young nun. After the second draft of the screenplay was completed, it was sent to Perkins as an acting job. After Perkins read the script, he wanted to direct the film, saying he would do it for nothing. Universal agreed to this. When the film went into pre-production, Anthony Perkins asked ''Psycho II'' director [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]] to co-direct the film with him; however Franklin declined. Filming for ''Psycho III'' began in June 1985. Perkins' main inspiration for the style of this film came from the movie ''[[Blood Simple]]'' directed by the [[Coen brothers]]. Before production began, he even took the entire cast and crew to a screening of the film. Like the two previous films, it was mostly shot on the backlot of Universal and in a number of sound stages. Despite ''Psycho III'' being Perkins' film directorial debut, the cast and crew have said in interviews that he was enjoyable to work with. [[Lee Garlington]], who played the waitress Myrna, stated: \"I have never to this date met a director who worked equally well with both the cast and crew. He was excited to be doing it, I adored him\". During filming, actor [[Jeff Fahey]] suffered an on-set injury. When filming the scene where Norman is hitting Duke with the guitar, Anthony Perkins actually hit Jeff Fahey so hard that it cut his head open and he had to get six stitches. A shot of Fahey's actual injury was used in the final film. Universal originally wanted to release the film in February 1986 but the release was moved to July 2, 1986 due to various re-shoots that included the ending. ''Psycho III'' was released on July 2, 1986 to a mixed response from critics and financial failure. It earned $3,238,400 in its opening weekend and went on to gross about $14,481,606 at the domestic box office, becoming the lowest-grossing theatrical film of the ''Psycho'' movie franchise.<ref name=\"mojo-p3\">{{cite web |url= https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=psycho3.htm |title= Psycho III |website = [[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date= 2011-04-17 }}</ref>\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film three out of five stars, saying: \"Any movie named \"Psycho III\" is going to be compared to the Hitchcock original, but Perkins isn't an imitator. He has his own agenda. He has lived with Norman Bates all these years, and he has some ideas about him, and although the movie doesn't apologize for Norman, it does pity him. For the first time, I was able to see that the true horror in the \"Psycho\" movies isn't what Norman does - but the fact that he is compelled to do it.\" Vincent Canby of ''The New York Times'' said: \"It has a cast of talented, self-effacing actors, who don't upstage the material, and an efficient screenplay by Charles Edward Pogue, who doesn't beat you over the head to prove that he has a sense of humor.\" Ken Hanke of Mountain Xpress called the film a \"superior horror sequel stylishly made by star Anthony Perkins\". Dave Kehr of ''The Chicago Reader'' said: \"Perkins tries to imitate Hitchcock's visual style, but most of the film is made without concern for style of any kind, unless it's the bludgeoning nonstyle of Friday the 13th.\" ''Variety'' called the film \"dependent almost entirely upon self-referential incidents and attitudes for its effect, and it eventually becomes wearying.\"\n\nWith the financial failure of ''Psycho III'', Universal decided to continue the ''Psycho'' franchise as a television series, taking inspiration from the ''[[Friday the 13th (TV series)|Friday the 13th]]'' and ''[[Freddy's Nightmares|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' TV series. In this televised [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''Psycho'', Norman Bates is portrayed by [[Kurt Paul]], who previously stood in as a [[stunt double]] for Anthony Perkins in ''Psycho II'' and ''Psycho III''. Perkins declined involvement in the project and even heavily boycotted it. The film was made as a [[pilot episode|pilot]] for a weekly anthology television series, but the series was never picked up.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092622/trivia|title=Trivia for Bates Motel|publisher=imdb.com|accessdate=2011-04-17}}</ref> Thus, Universal decided to air the pilot as a made-for-TV film over the [[Independence Day (United States)|4th of July]] weekend. The film received mostly negative reviews and low Nielson ratings.\n\nA year after ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' aired, production on ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' began. Perkins wanted to direct the film and even came up with a pitch for the film along with ''Psycho III'' screenwriter Charles Edward Pogue; however ''Psycho III'' was a critical and financial failure so Universal rejected that idea and [[Mick Garris]] was brought in.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/54/psychoiv.php |title=Who Owns Norman Bates? |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=November 2006 |work= |publisher=Bright Lights Film Journal |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> [[Joseph Stefano]] was the screenwriter of the original film and was brought back to write the fourth film. He had disliked the two films between I and IV, feeling that they were too commercial and catered to the conventions of slasher movies. In an interview, Stefano stated \"Gearing up for ''Psycho IV'', I decided to ignore the two sequels \u2013 like the business in II about Norman\u2019s mother.\"<ref>[http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2008/09/interview-psycho-screenwriter-joseph-stefano/ Interview: Psycho Screenwriter Joseph Stefano By Steve Biodrowski \u2022 September 16, 2008]</ref>\n\nActress [[Olivia Hussey]] was directly offered the role of Mrs. Bates.

In the documentary ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'', Thomas stated: \"Looking back on it now, he knew he had to have this conversation with me but I don't think that he was really into it. He just gave me a few broad strokes and told me to play the character real, that was it.\"<ref>{{cite video |people=Robert V.

Director Mick Garris has stated in numerous interviews that he had some creative control issues with Perkins. \"He would get into long, drawn-out discussions in front of the crew, testing his director, making sure choices were not made \"because it looks good\", and seeing how deep the understanding of the story and process were. He could be very forceful, just shy of bullying, but also really appreciated helpful direction. I would have to say he was the most difficult and challenging actor I've ever worked with, but he ended up going on and on about how happy he was with the film. That was gratifying\", Garris says.<ref>[http://www.thepsychomovies.com/films/psycho4/mgarris.html Interview with Director Mick Garris at \"The Psycho Movies\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401083024/http://www.thepsychomovies.com/films/psycho4/mgarris.html |date=2012-04-01 }}</ref>\n\n''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' was filmed at [[Universal Studios Florida]] in [[Orlando, Florida]] from June 4 to July 13, 1990. The facade of the Bates Motel and the Bates mansion were re-created at the theme park. The production was originally to be filmed before the opening of the park but due to delays and the studio's desire to have a high-profile production on the lot, the film was shot while the park was open. This led to tourists being able to watch the filming of several scenes at the motel and house on the back lot.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews when first broadcast on Showtime. Henry Stewart of ''L Magazine'' said: \"Garris evinces high-grade professionalism, but his comic-book approximations of real emotions\u2014like desire, madness and murderlust\u2014feel empty. Hitchcock this most certainly ain't.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thelmagazine.com/newyork/psycho-the-book-the-sequels/Content?oid=1794136 |title=Psycho, the Book, the Sequels |author=Mark Asch and Henry Stewart |date= |work= |publisher=The L Magazine |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> Ninja Dixon.com stated: \"This is a good TV movie, way better than {{sic|it's}} reputation, and continues the tradition of great acting in the series.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ninjadixon.blogspot.com/2009/08/psycho-iv-beginning-1990.html |title=Psycho IV: The Beginning (1990) |author=Ninja Dixon |date=August 6, 2009 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> Cult Reviews.com said: \"The film is shot well, the fire sequence, by Rodney Charters, is particularly stunning.

Some changes are pervasive: as the film opens, it is made clear that it is set in the late 1990s, so minor changes are made throughout the dialogue to reflect the new timeframe. For example, all the references to money are updated (how much Marion Crane steals, how much a car costs, how much a hotel room costs), as are references to terms from the original script like \"[[aspic]]\" that would seem [[Anachronism|anachronistic]] in the new setting.\n\nAccording to Van Sant, in the original the only fully fleshed-out character was [[Norman Bates]]; the other major characters were more iconic, purposely written and portrayed to advance the plot. Van Sant relied upon his main cast more to flesh out and make consistent their character's motivations and worked with them to determine to what degree their characters were similar to the originals. William H. Macy chose to stay true to the original, while others, such as Vaughn and Julianne Moore, interpreted the dialogue and scenes from the original film differently. Moore's version of Lila Crane was much more aggressive than the one portrayed by [[Vera Miles]], and there are differences in Marion Crane's evolving attitudes about the money she stole.\n\nThe [[cinematography]] and [[cinematic techniques]] were consistent between the two films in many memorable scenes, including the shower scene, scenes of the mother, scenes of the swamp, and the scene of Arbogast on the staircase, but other scenes changed significantly, particularly the climax, and the Dr. Simon monologue at the end, which was much shorter. Van Sant's comments from the commentary track attributes many of the updates to the need to make the film more accessible to a new audience.\n\nThe film earned $37,141,130 at the box office, $21,456,130 of which came from North America.<ref name=\"mojo-p1998\">{{mojo title|id=psycho98|title=Psycho (1998)}}</ref> Estimates of the production budget range from $20 million<ref>[https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1998/PSYCH.php ''Psych'' (1998)] from The Numbers</ref> to $60 million;<ref name=\"mojo-p1998\"/> while promoting his 2002 film ''[[Gerry (2002 film)|Gerry]]'', Van Sant said he thought the producers \"broke even\" financially.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.webwombat.com.au/entertainment/movies/gus-van-sant-int.htm| title=Gus Vant Sant: Exclusive Interview| last=Morris| first=Clint| publisher=Web Wombat| accessdate=2009-03-30}}</ref>\n\nThis version of ''Psycho'' received mostly negative reviews; it was awarded two [[Golden Raspberry Awards]] for [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off or Sequel|Worst Remake or Sequel]] and [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Director|Worst Director]] for Gus Van Sant, while Anne Heche was nominated as [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress|Worst Actress]].

Many people refer to this film as a duplicate of the [[Psycho (1960 film)|1960 film]] rather than a remake.

''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'' (1998), a shot-for-shot [[remake]] of the first film is not a sequel since it retells the same events as the original film, but set in 1998. There are also some continuity problems in ''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' that have to do with some of the past events explored in ''Psycho'', ''Psycho II'', and ''Psycho III''. Reflecting on the continuity issues, Robert Price writes \"It seems that all the different Psychos drift into and out of one another. There is no real sequence. All are variant versions of the same myth. The deep conflict being rehearsed and resolved in these movies is that of the [[Oedipus complex|Oedipal complex]].\"\n\n==Home media==\n[[File:Psycho DVD set.JPG|thumb|right|200px|2003 DVD box set of the first four main films ([[United Kingdom|UK]]).]]\n''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'', ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'', the ''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'' remake and ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' have been released on [[VHS]].

Russell (cinematographer)|John L. Russell]] and Best Art Direction for [[Joseph Hurley (art director)|Joseph Hurley]], [[Robert Clatworthy (art director)|Robert Clatworthy]] and [[George Milo]]. All three sequels have been nominated for [[Saturn Awards]]: ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'' for Best Supporting Actress ([[Meg Tilly]]); ''[[Psycho III]]'' for Best Horror Film and Best Actor ([[Anthony Perkins]]); and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' for Best Genre Television Series.\n\n===Legacy===\n''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' has become one of the most recognizable films ever made. The shower scene alone has become one of the most iconic cut scenes in cinematic history. ''Psycho'' is frequently referenced, given homage to or spoofed in television shows such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[American Dad!]]'', ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'', ''[[Maude (TV series)|Maude]]'', ''[[The Golden Girls]]'' and more. Films such as ''[[Scream 2]]'', ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', ''[[Throw Momma from the Train]]'', ''[[Scary Movie]]'' and more have referenced the film. Many critics and filmmakers have cited ''Psycho'' as the film that modernized the horror genre. Horror writer David. J. Schow stated (in ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'') \"It brought the idea that the killer in a horror film was not a mutant, didn't have dents in his head; he could look like that nice young boy from next door\". The film also brought in a new level of acceptable violence and sexuality in movies. Both [[Anthony Perkins]] and [[Janet Leigh]] spent the rest of their careers being typecasted by the film. Even [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s films began to decline in critical and financial popularity after the release of ''Psycho''. Hitchcock film scholars argue that for the rest of his career, Hitchcock's films were constantly being compared to ''Psycho''. The \"Psycho\" films still maintain a very large fanbase. Various websites dedicated to the franchise such as ''The Psycho Movies.com'' have appeared on the Internet. Books detailing the making and impact of the film such as ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]'', ''The Moment of Psycho'', Janet Leigh's ''Psycho: Behind The Scenes of the Classic Thriller'' have been published over the years. Two retrospective documentaries have been released detailing the making of all four films including ''The Making of Psycho'' (1997) and ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'' (2010). The film also spawned the show ''[[Alfred Hitchcock: The Art of Making Movies (attraction)|Alfred Hitchcock: The Art of Making Movies]]'' at [[Universal Studios Florida]], with part of the show detailing how the shower scene was filmed. In 1992, ''Psycho'' was added to the [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]].\n\nA musical stage adaptation, ''Psycho: The Musical'', was performed January 25 to February 9, 2019 at PULP Black Box Theatre in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]]. <ref>https://www.facebook.com/events/1973956552682770/</ref>\n\n==Other media and merchandise==\n\nVarious ''Psycho'' related merchandise has been sold ever since the release of the original film. Merchandise includes T-shirts, posters, DVDs, books, stationery, shot glasses, shower curtains, action figures, model house kits, pens and more. Much of the merchandise is related to the fictional Bates Motel where items commonly found in an actual motel have the Bates Motel logo on them. A Bates Motel light up sign was released in 2009. To coincide with the 50th anniversary of the release of the original film, a Psycho house model kit was released in the U.S. Props from all the films are also sold occasionally on [[eBay]]. The original one sheet poster for ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' is worth around $3000 in mint condition. The original one sheets for ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' are worth around $50 each.\n\n===Graphic novels===\nIn 1992, a series of [[graphic novel]]s based on the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' was published by the Innovation Comics group. Today, the novels are out of print and are very rare to find.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n===The ''Psycho'' House and Bates Motel sets===\nThe Bates House and Motel were constructed on the backlot at [[Universal Studios Hollywood|Universal City Studios]] in 1959 for the production of ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''. It has been said that the house, designed by art directors [[Joseph Hurley (art director)|Joseph Hurley]] and [[Robert Clatworthy (art director)|Robert Clathworthy]], was loosely based on an [[Edward Hopper]] painting called \"House by the Railroad\". The house and motel sets were actually empty shells, also known as facades. When the house was originally built, there was no right side of the house, since the right side is never seen on camera in the original ''Psycho'' film. Interiors of the Bates house and motel were constructed on Sound stage 18-A at Universal, just a short walk from the actual exterior locations making production convenient for all involved. After production had wrapped on ''Psycho'', the house was featured in several television productions including ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'', ''[[Wagon Train]]'' and ''[[Thriller (American TV series)|Boris Karloff's Thriller]]''.\n\nIn 1964, Universal Studios opened its patented [[Studio Tour|Studio Tram Tour]]. The right side of the house was then added and the set was unceremoniously dubbed \"The Psycho House\". The house and even the motel went on to appear in several shows such as ''[[Night Gallery]]'', ''[[The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries]]'' and even in films such as ''[[Invitation to a Gunfighter]]'' and ''[[Modern Problems]]''. The motel was torn down in 1979 and the house was moved to an alternate location on the backlot to accommodate the new tour. In 1982, Richard Franklin and Hilton A. Green announced plans to film ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]''. The house was then moved to a location that best matched the original hill and only about 40 feet of the motel was actually re-built. The rest of the motel in the film was a matte painting. TV shows during the '80s promoted the Universal Tour and prominently featured the Psycho House including ''[[Amazing Stories (1985 TV series)|Amazing Stories]]'', ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]'' and ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]''.\n\nIn 1985, the Bates Motel was fully re-built for the filming of ''[[Psycho III]]''. In 1987, the NBC-TV network announced plans for the TV pilot ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]''. The motel in the film was re-modeled to look very Spanish like. This version of the set remained until 1994 when the new renovations were taken away and the motel was put back to look the way it did in the original Psycho. A 1992 episode of ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'' called \"Incident in Lot 7\" featured the Psycho House and Bates Motel as key locations in the popular [[Angela Lansbury]] series.\n\nIn 1988, plans for ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' were underway at Universal. Plans to shoot the movie in Orlando, Florida were set into motion and the film crew constructed a full-scale replica of the Bates Motel and Psycho House at the soon-to-be built [[Universal Studios Florida]]. The final dressing and painting was done by the Psycho IV art department crew in 1990, but the house and motel was fully built in 1988 long before the production team was assembled for the project. After production wrapped, the sets were left as attractions at the park until 1999 when it was torn down to make room for another attraction.\n\nIn 1998, the Psycho House in California was renovated to preserve the set. All of the rotting wood was replaced and the set had a new paint job. That same year, plans to remake ''Psycho'' were announced. It was originally announced that Gus Van Sant was going to be using the original house and motel sets. However, the production team built a new house directly in front of the old one, and the motel was updated to look like it was from the 1960s. The new house was moved next to the original house and remained there for about three years after production. In 2003, due to popular demand, the remake's house was torn down and the motel was restored to the original way once again. To this day, the house and motel are still standing on the backlot of Universal and continue to be major tourist attractions. The [[Studio Tour|tram tour]] features an actor playing Norman Bates coming out of cabin 1 with a body, putting it in the trunk of a car and then wielding a large knife at the tourists as the tram drives away.\n\n===''24 Hour Psycho''===\nAn art installation, ''[[24 Hour Psycho]]'', created by artist [[Douglas Gordon]] in 1993, and later installed in the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York, consists of a silent screening of ''Psycho'', slowed down to two frames per second (from the usual 24), so that it lasts 24 hours rather than 109 minutes. ''24 Hour Psycho'' is featured prominently in [[Don DeLillo]]'s 2010 novel ''[[Point Omega]]''.\n\n===''The Psycho Legacy'' (2010)===\n{{Main|The Psycho Legacy}}\nIn 2010, a [[direct-to-video|direct-to-DVD]] documentary was released called ''The Psycho Legacy''. It included interviews with cast and crew from all four ''Psycho'' films. It also featured interviews with current horror filmmakers who are fans of the series. The documentary was written, produced and directed by horror journalist Robert Galluzzo. Galluzo made the documentary because of the lack of information on the sequels and also to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the release of the original film. The documentary discussed the impact and legacy of the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' and the production stories of ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]''. To the surprise of some critics and fans, the failed TV pilot ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' and the [[Gus Van Sant]] [[Psycho (1998 film)|remake]] were not discussed in the documentary, however originally in the deleted scenes section on the DVD two short segments on the two films were supposed to be on there, however for unknown reasons they were left off of the DVD when it was released. The documentary sold well, received mostly positive reviews and garnered new interest in the series from horror fans.\n\n===''Hitchcock'' (2012)===\n{{Main|Hitchcock (film)}}\nOn April 13, 2012, production started on a film adaptation of [[Stephen Rebello]]'s non-fiction book ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]'', which follows the complex relationship between [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and wife [[Alma Reville]] during the filming of ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' in 1959.

The first film, ''Psycho'', was directed by filmmaker [[Alfred Hitchcock]].<ref>http://www.thepsychomovies.com/movies/psycho/</ref> Subsequently, another film related to the series was made: an [[Hitchcock (film)|Alfred Hitchcock biopic]] based on the book ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]''. Also, an independent documentary called ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'' was released on October 19, 2010. It mostly focused on ''Psycho II'', ''Psycho III'' and ''Psycho IV: The Beginning'', but did cover the impact and legacy of the original film. \n\nThe films focus on the life of [[Norman Bates]], a deeply disturbed young man who operates the Bates Motel. He is mentally unstable from a domineering relationship with his mother, which results in him having a psychotic twisted personality and, as a result, he occasionally kills people.\n\nA five-season TV series, ''[[Bates Motel (TV series)|Bates Motel]]'', aired on [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]] between 2013 and 2017. In a modern-day setting, it is a re-imagining of the Norman and Norma Bates characters, and their unusual relationship. It stars [[Freddie Highmore]] as teenaged Norman and [[Vera Farmiga]] as mother Norma.\n\n==Novels==\n{{unsourced section|date=August 2016}}\n===''Psycho'' (1959)===\n{{Main|Psycho (novel)}}\nIn 1959, the novel ''Psycho'' was published. It was loosely based on the Wisconsin serial killer and cannibal [[Ed Gein]]. Author [[Robert Bloch]] lived 40 miles away from Gein's farmhouse and liked the idea of somebody being able to kill people in a small community and get away with it for years without being caught. The character of [[Norman Bates]] was very different in the novel from in [[Psycho (1960 film)|the film version]]. In the novel, Bates is overweight, in his early 40s and drinks heavily. When [[Joseph Stefano]] adapted the novel into the screenplay, he made the character of Norman young, attractive and vulnerable.\n\n===''Psycho II'' (1982)===\n{{Main|Psycho II (novel)}}\nIn 1982, Bloch wrote a sequel novel called ''Psycho II'' which had nothing to do with the [[Psycho II (film)|1983 film version]]. In the novel, Norman Bates escapes the mental institution and goes to Hollywood to stop the production of a film based on his life. Many critics and fans described the novel as being silly and weird and couldn't have possibly been made into a film.\n\n===''Psycho House'' (1990)===\n{{Main|Psycho House}}\nIn 1990, due to the pressure from his publishing company, Bloch wrote a third novel called ''Psycho House''. However, according to horror writer [[David J. Schow]], when writing it Bloch originally called it ''Psycho 13''. In the novel set ten years after Norman Bates' death, the Bates mansion and motel are bought as [[tourist attraction]]s and a series of murders begin to take place.\n\n==Films==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"  style=\"text-align:center; width:100%;\" \n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Film\n! scope=\"col\" | U.S. release date\n! scope=\"col\" | Director\n! scope=\"col\" | Screenwriter \n! scope=\"col\" | Producer(s)\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" |Original series\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left\" | ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''\n| June 16, 1960\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Alfred Hitchcock]]\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Joseph Stefano]]\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Alfred Hitchcock]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left\" | ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]''\n| June 3, 1983\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]]\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Tom Holland (director)|Tom Holland]]\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Hilton A.

While en route to Sam's [[California]] home, she parks along the road to sleep. A highway patrol officer awakens her and, suspicious of her agitation, follows her. When she trades her car for another at a dealership, he notes the new vehicle's details. Marion returns to the road but, rather than drive in a heavy storm, decides to spend the night at the Bates Motel.  The proprietor, [[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]), tells Marion he rarely has customers because of the motel's disconnection from a new [[Interstate highway system|Interstate]] and mentions he lives with [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|his mother]] in the house overlooking the motel. He invites Marion to supper. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother about letting Marion in the house, and during the meal, she angers him by suggesting he institutionalize his mother. He admits he would like this, but does not want to abandon her.\n\nMarion resolves to return to Phoenix to return the money. After calculating how she can repay the money she has spent, Marion dumps her notes down the toilet and begins to shower. An anonymous female figure enters the bathroom and stabs her to death. Finding the corpse, Norman is horrified. He places Marion's body, wrapped in the shower curtain, and all her possessions &mdash; including the money &mdash; in the trunk of her car and sinks it in a nearby swamp.\n\nShortly afterward, Sam is contacted by both Marion's sister [[Lila Crane]] ([[Vera Miles]]) and private detective Milton Arbogast ([[Martin Balsam]]), who has been hired by Marion's employer to recover the money. Arbogast traces Marion to the motel and questions Norman, who unconvincingly lies that Marion stayed for one night and left the following morning. He refuses to let Arbogast talk to his mother, claiming she is ill. Arbogast calls Lila to update her and tells her he will call again after he questions Norman's mother.\n\nArbogast enters Norman's house and at the top of the stairs is attacked by a figure who slashes his face with a knife, pushes him down the stairs, then stabs him to death. When Arbogast does not call Lila, she and Sam contact the local police. Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers ([[John McIntire]]) is perplexed to learn Arbogast saw a woman in a window since Norman's mother died ten years ago. Norman confronts his mother and urges her to hide in the cellar. She rejects the idea and orders him out of her room, but against her will, Norman carries her to the cellar.\n\nPosing as a married couple, Sam and Lila check into the motel and search Marion's room, where they find a scrap of paper in the toilet with \"$40,000\" written on it. While Sam distracts Norman, Lila sneaks into the house. Sam suggests to Norman that he killed Marion for the money so he could buy a new hotel. Realizing Lila is not around, Norman knocks Sam unconscious and rushes to the house. Lila sees him and hides in the cellar where she discovers the semi-preserved and [[mummy|mummified]] body of Norman's mother. Wearing his mother's clothes and a wig and carrying a knife, Norman enters and tries to attack Lila, but she is rescued by Sam.\n\nAfter Norman's arrest, [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] Dr. Richmond ([[Simon Oakland]]) tells Sam and Lila that Norman's dead mother is living in Norman's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as an [[dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]]. After the death of Norman's father, the pair lived as if they were the only people in the world. When his mother found a lover, Norman went mad with jealousy and murdered them both. Consumed with guilt, Norman \"erased the crime\" by bringing his mother back to life in his mind. He stole her corpse and preserved the body. When he was \"Mother\", he acted, talked, and dressed as she would. The psychiatrist concludes that the \"Mother\" personality now has complete control of Norman's mind.\n\nIn the final scene, Norman sits in a cell, thinking in \"Mother's\" voice. In a voiceover, \"Mother\" explains that she plans to prove that she is incapable of violence by refusing to swat a fly that has landed on her hand. The final shot shows Marion's car being recovered from the swamp.\n\n===''Psycho II'' (1983)===\n{{Main|Psycho II (film)}}\n[[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) is released from a mental institution after 22 years. [[Lila Crane|Lila Loomis]] ([[Vera Miles]]), the sister of Bates' victim [[Marion Crane]] and widow of the now-deceased Sam Loomis, vehemently protests with a petition that she has been circulating with signatures of 743 people, including the relatives of the six people Norman killed prior to his incarceration, but her plea is dismissed. Norman is taken to his old home, the Bates Motel, with the house behind it on the hill, by Dr. Bill Raymond ([[Robert Loggia]]), who assures him everything will be fine. He is introduced to the motel's new manager, Warren Toomey ([[Dennis Franz]]). The following day, Norman reports to a pre-arranged job at a nearby diner, run by a kindly old lady named [[Emma Spool]] ([[Claudia Bryar]]). One of his co-workers there is Mary Loomis ([[Meg Tilly]]), a young waitress. Mary claims she has been thrown out of her boyfriend's place and needs a place to stay. Norman offers to let her stay at the motel, then extends the offer to his home when he discovers that Toomey has turned his beloved establishment into a sleazy adult motel.\n\nNorman's adjustment back into society appears to be going along well until \"Mother\" begins to make her presence known. Norman gets mysterious notes from \"Mother\" at the house and diner. Phone calls come from someone claiming to be Norman's mother. Toomey picks a fight at the diner after Norman fires him. Later, a figure in a black dress stabs Toomey to death with a kitchen knife as he is packing to leave the motel. Norman begins to doubt his sanity when he begins hearing voices in the house. He enters his mother's bedroom to find it looks exactly as it did 22 years ago. A sound lures him to the attic, where he is locked in. Believing the house to be abandoned, a teenage couple sneaks in through the cellar window. They notice a female figure pacing in the next room. As they try to climb out, the boy is stabbed to death. The girl escapes and alerts the police. Mary eventually finds Norman in the attic. Sheriff Hunt ([[Hugh Gillin]]) questions them about the boy's murder. He finds the cellar neat and orderly. Norman is about to admit that something suspicious is going on, but Mary claims that she has cleaned up the basement herself. After the sheriff leaves, Norman asks Mary why she lied. She explains that she had to save him from being arrested. Norman collapses into the chair with his head in his hands and moans, \"It's starting again!\"\n\nMary is startled later when she discovers someone looking at her through a peephole in the bathroom wall. She calls out to Norman, who is downstairs and out of reach. The two are horrified to find a bloody cloth that has been stuffed down the toilet. Norman appears confused and believes he may have committed another murder. Mary goes down to check the motel. In the parlor she is surprised by Lila, who reveals herself to be Mary's mother. She has been calling Norman claiming to be his mother, even going so far as to dress up as her and allowing him to see her in the window. Mary has been helping her. She was responsible for restoring Mother's room at the house and locking Norman in the attic. All of this was an attempt to drive Norman insane again and have him recommitted.\n\nMary's growing feelings for Norman, however, have been preying on her conscience leaving her to reconsider her actions. Meanwhile, Dr. Raymond discovers Mary's identity as Lila's daughter and informs Norman. He also orders the corpse of Norma Bates (which was buried in a proper grave after the events of the original film) to be exhumed, to prove that Norman isn't being haunted by his mother. Mary admits to Norman that she has been part of Lila's ruse, and that while she now refuses to continue, Lila won't stop. Mary goes to Lila's hotel and their argument is overheard by a bartender. Later, Lila drives over to Norman's house, unaware that Dr. Raymond is watching her from the Bates Motel as she sneaks into the cellar. While removing her \"Mother\" costume from a loose stone in the floor, another figure dressed as \"Mother\" steps out of the shadows and murders her. Dr. Raymond runs up to the house. Lila's body is not in the cellar.\n\nMeanwhile, Mary discovers that a car has been retrieved from the swamp, with Toomey's body in the trunk. Realizing the police will shortly arrive to arrest Norman, Mary returns to warn him. The phone rings in the house, Norman answers, and starts speaking to his \"mother\". Mary listens in and discovers that nobody is on the line with Norman. Terrified, Mary runs downstairs into the cellar, and quickly dresses up as Mother to confront Norman. Someone grabs her from behind, and she plunges the butcher knife into ... Dr. Raymond, who has sneaked back into the house. A stunned Mary runs downstairs and is confronted by a deranged Norman, who promises to cover up for \"Mother\". Mary tries to keep him away, repeatedly stabbing him in the hands and chest. He backs Mary into the fruit cellar to hide and slips on a pile of coal, which avalanches away from the wall, revealing Lila's body hidden behind it. Mary is now convinced that Norman had been committing the murders. She raises her knife to stab him and is shot to death by the incoming police. The sheriff inaccurately believes Lila and Mary committed all the murders.\n\nThat evening, a woman walks up the steps to the Bates' mansion. Bandaged from his injuries, Norman has set a place for dinner when he hears a knock at the door. It is Emma Spool, the kindly woman from the diner. Norman gives her a cup of tea. Mrs. Spool tells him that she is his real mother, that Mrs. Bates was her sister, who adopted Norman as an infant while Mrs. Spool was institutionalized. She further reveals that she was the murderer, having killed anybody who tried to harm her son. As she sips the tea, Norman kills her with a sudden blow to the head with a shovel. Norman is now completely insane again. He carries Mrs. Spool's body upstairs to Mother's room and we hear Mother's voice warn Norman not to play with \"filthy girls\". Norman reopens the Bates Motel and stands in front of the house, waiting for new customers as Mother watches from the window upstairs.\n\n===''Psycho III'' (1986)===\n{{Main|Psycho III}}\nMaureen Coyle ([[Diana Scarwid]]), a mentally unstable young nun, is on top of a bell tower about to commit suicide. When another nun tries to get her to come down, Maureen accidentally pushes her over the railing to her death. Another nun tells Maureen that she will burn in hell. She is forced to leave the convent after this ordeal.\n\n[[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) is still manning the desk at the Bates Motel and living with the preserved corpse of his real mother, [[Emma Spool]] ([[Claudia Bryar]]), whom Norman killed at the end of ''Psycho II''. Local law enforcement and Norman's ex-boss Ralph Statler ([[Robert Alan Browne]]) are concerned since Mrs. Spool has been missing for over a month. Duane Duke ([[Jeff Fahey]]), a sleazy musician desperate for money, is offered the job of assistant manager at the Bates Motel. Maureen, now the new long-term tenant, has some issues to resolve in her life. She gave up her vows as a nun only days before, and she isn't sure just how she feels about either spiritual or earthly matters.\n\nSheriff John Hunt ([[Hugh Gillin]]) and Statler have a conversation at the diner, when Tracy Venable ([[Roberta Maxwell]]), a pushy journalist from Los Angeles, interrupts them. She is working on an article about serial killers being put back on the streets. Venable is trying to back up her theory that Norman is back to his old ways again. Norman appears and Venable jumps at the chance to talk with him. Unaware of her ulterior motives Norman opens up to her, but is distracted when an exhausted Maureen enters and sits at the lunch counter. He is startled by Maureen's presence, because he feels she strongly resembles [[Marion Crane]]. Seeing the initials \"M.C.\" on her suitcase, Norman freaks out and leaves the diner. After a conversation with \"Mother\", Norman spies on Maureen as she undresses and heads into the bathroom to take a shower. Keeping \"her\" word, \"Mother\" enters Maureen's motel room with plans to kill her. Upon pulling back the shower curtain, it is revealed Maureen has attempted suicide by cutting her wrists, a sight which snaps Norman back to his \"normal\" side. Maureen looks up at \"Mother\" who is so weakened by what \"she\" sees, \"she\" lowers the knife. Due to blood loss, Maureen hallucinates and she mistakes Norman, dressed up as \"Mother\", for the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] holding a silver crucifix.\n\nMeanwhile, Tracy has met with Duane at a bar where they discuss Norman, and it seems Tracy blames Norman for Mrs. Spool's disappearance. When she leaves, Duane picks up another girl at the bar, Red ([[Juliette Cummins]]). Norman gets Maureen to the local hospital to save her life. After she is released, he invites her to stay back at the motel and they begin a romantic relationship. The same night, Duane and Red arrive at the motel and hear an argument between \"Mother\" and Norman, but think it's just a TV turned up too loud. Red and Duane, head to cabin 12 where they make love. Later that night, Red, makes it clear she wants more than just a fling. Calling him a pig, they argue. Duane, infuriated, throws her out of the cabin. Red heads down to the payphone to call a cab, where she realizes she is wearing her blouse backwards. As she takes it off to put it on the right way, \"Mother\" shatters the phone booth door and stabs a trapped Red to death. The next morning, Duane finds Norman scrubbing down the phone booth.\n\nA group from out of town arrive at the motel where they plan to watch the local [[American football|football]] game. Tracy comes to find Norman and ask questions about his past and \"Mother\". Norman becomes defensive with the reporter and tells her to leave, never to return. Later that night, he and Maureen go to a restaurant, where they dance and talk romantically, while Tracy searches Mrs. Spool's apartment. She discovers the Bates Motel's telephone number written on a magazine cover. Norman and Maureen return to the motel to find most of the other guests engaged in drunken stupor. Norman goes with Maureen to her room and they fall asleep in each other's arms having refused to make love. Some time afterwards, Patsy Boyle (Katt Shea Ruben), the only sober guest, wakes up Maureen to ensure her safety as Norman had left the door open, a bad idea with all the drunken guests around. Patsy, needing to use the bathroom, finds the one in Norman's parlor unoccupied, but \"Mother\" again emerges and slashes her throat. Norman (an homage to the reaction of finding Marion dead in the shower in the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'') gasps when he discovers Patsy's body. He buries her in the motel's ice chest outside the office.\n\nThe next morning, Sheriff Hunt and Deputy Leo appear at Norman's house to investigate Patsy's disappearance. Norman tries to prevent Hunt from entering his mother's bedroom, when he discovers that \"Mother\"/Mrs. Spool has disappeared completely. Outside, Tracy tells Maureen about Norman, and she, rather upset, leaves the motel and goes to stay with Father Brian (Gary Bayer), who took care of her at the hospital. Meanwhile, Tracy is convinced Norman is behind the latest disappearances. Norman searches for his mother all over the house and finds a note from her stating that she is in cabin 12. When Norman arrives at the cabin, he learns it was Duane who took \"Mother\". Duane confronts him then attempts to blackmail Norman into paying him off, or he'll turn Norman into the police. He tells Duane he doesn't have that kind of money, but Duane reminds him that Norman has made a lot of cash from his business, and if Norman doesn't give money for his silence, he will go to the police. He agrees to Duane's blackmail demands, but he then unexpectedly throws an ashtray at Duane's head. They fight and Norman seemingly kills Duane by hitting him several times with his own guitar. Terrified of what he has done, he blames \"Mother\" for this.\n\nTracy talks to Statler and Myrna ([[Lee Garlington]]) about Mrs. Spool and discovers she was working at the diner before Statler bought it from Harvey Leach. Tracy meets with Leach, a resident at an assisted living facility, and is informed that Mrs. Spool had also once been institutionalized for murder. Meanwhile, Norman drives Duane's car to the swamp with Duane and Patsy's bodies in it. Duane turns out to be alive and attacks Norman, who accidentally drives the car into the swamp. He struggles out of the car while Duane drowns. Tracy reads some old newspapers at her study and discovers about the \"Bates kidnapping\".\n\nMaureen convinces herself that Norman is her true love. She returns to the motel and takes a shower before visiting Norman at his house. They share a tender moment at the top of the staircase when \"Mother\" shouts furiously at Norman, which startles him and causes him to lose grip on Maureen's hands. She falls down the stairs into the Cupid statue at the base of the stairs. She goes limp and sinks to the floor revealing the arrow had punctured her skull. Distraught, Norman screams and confronts his mother, saying that he will get her for this. \"You don't have the guts, boy!\" declares \"Mother\".\n\nAt that moment, Tracy arrives at the motel and tries to find Maureen. She enters the house only to find her lying dead on the couch of the living room which is filled with lit candles. Then she sees Norman dressed as \"Mother\", holding a knife, and tries to flee. She tries to reason with Norman by explaining his family history: Emma Spool, who ''was'' in fact his aunt, was in love with Norman's father, but he married her sister, Norma, instead. Mrs. Spool, having serious psychological problems, kidnapped Norman when he was a baby after she killed Mr. Bates, believing Norman was the child \"she should have had with him.\" She discovers Mrs. Spool's corpse in the bedroom, and Norman takes off his mother's dress. \"Mother\" orders him to kill Tracy, and when Norman raises the knife, he instead brutally attacks \"Mother,\" dismembering her preserved remains. The last scene shows Sheriff Hunt taking Norman to his squad car, with Father Brian and Tracy following behind. Hunt informs Norman that they may never let him out of the institution again, Norman replies, \"But I'll be free... I'll finally be free.\" Norman, sitting silently in the back of the squad car on the way to the institution, enjoys his victory over his mother by caressing a trophy: the severed hand of Mrs. Spool. He smiles sardonically as the screen fades to black and the credits roll.\n\n===''Bates Motel'' (1987)===\n{{main|Bates Motel (film)}}\nA [[television film|made-for-television]] [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] film. Alex West ([[Bud Cort]]) is a mentally disturbed youth who was admitted to an asylum for killing his abusive stepfather. At the asylum, he roomed with [[Norman Bates]] ([[Kurt Paul]]) and they eventually became close friends. Years later, Norman dies and Alex learns that he has inherited the Bates Motel. He travels to Norman's California hometown (renamed Fairville for this film; in the original film it was Fairvale) and with a little help from teenage runaway Willie ([[Lori Petty]]) and local handyman Henry Watson ([[Moses Gunn]]), Alex struggles to re-open the motel for business, until rumors about the place being haunted by the ghost of Norman's mother, [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|Mrs. Bates]], are apparently true. Only to find that the haunting was a prank and the ghost was the bank manager, Tom Fuller ([[Gregg Henry]]), who refused to give Alex a loan by trying to scare him away. Tom is then forced to help Alex and the others with renovating the motel or face prison for fraud. The motel was soon finished with the renovation.\n\nMeanwhile, Barbara Peters ([[Kerrie Keane]]) runs away from home and ends up staying in Alex's motel for the night, contemplating suicide for getting older, going through three divorces, and not having children. Barbara meets a teenage girl ([[Khrystyne Haje]]), who invites Barbara to dance at an after prom party in the motel with her and her teenage friends, including Tony Scotti ([[Jason Bateman]]), though Barbara felt uncomfortable hanging with young kids. It is then revealed that Barbara's real name is Sally, and that the teenage girl is her younger self from an alternate dimension who took her own life and is now trapped in \"the other side\", along with Tony, and other teens who also committed suicide. Sally tells Barbara that she has a life worth living for, then Sally leaves with the rest of the group. Barbara leaves the motel the next day, planning to live her life to the fullest. Alex looks at the screen telling viewers, \"If you ever need a room, come by. I can't say for sure what you'll find, but it is what makes the world go around.\"\n\n===''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' (1990)===\n{{Main|Psycho IV: The Beginning}}\nFran Ambrose ([[CCH Pounder]]) is a radio talk show host who is talking on the topic of \"matricide\" (when children kill their mothers) with guest Dr. Richmond ([[Warren Frost]]), who was [[Norman Bates]]' former psychologist. The radio receives a call from Norman Bates ([[Anthony Perkins]]), who has re-entered society and married his former psychiatrist, Connie (Donna Mitchell). Under the alias of \"Ed\" (possibly a reference to Ed Gein, the killer after whom the character of Norman was modeled), Norman tells his story, which the audience sees as a series of flashbacks set in the 1940s and 1950s. Some flashbacks are [[Reverse chronology|slightly out of order]]. The chronological story is: In 1950, Norman's mother, [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|Norma Bates]] ([[Olivia Hussey]]) had schizophrenia (see ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]''); she was smothering Norman and would have violent mood swings. Due to Norman's sexual repression at her hands, when she was frolicking with him he had an incestuous erection, causing her to dress him in women's clothing and taunt him by calling him \"Norma.\" She then got engaged to a man named Chet Rudolph (Thomas Schuster), who would beat up Norman. Eventually Norman got fed up with her allowing Chet to be in their lives and poisoned them both, albeit reluctantly. He then developed his infamous multiple personality disorder and stole her corpse to create the illusion that she was alive - whenever her corpse spoke to him, the \"Norma\" personality would take over. This caused Norman as \"Norma\" to kill two women who wanted to have sex with him.\n\nThroughout the spaces in the flashbacks, Dr. Richmond realizes \"Ed\" is Norman and tries to convince Fran to trace the calls. Richmond's worries are dismissed because they cannot trace the call and they believe they can talk Norman out of the reason he called: he fears he will kill again. He tells Fran that Connie got pregnant against his wishes and that he does not want another \"monster\". He then tells Fran he does believe his mother is dead, but he will kill Connie \"with my own hands, just like the first time\". He then takes Connie to his mother's house and attempts to kill her, but after Connie reassures Norman that their child will not be a monster, he drops his knife in shame and Connie forgives him. He then burns the house where all his unhappiness began. As he tries to escape the flames, he hallucinates that he sees his victims, Chet, his mother and eventually himself preserving her corpse. He and Connie leave the scene with Norman stating, \"I'm free.\"  However, as the credits roll, the sound of his newborn baby crying can be heard.\n\n===''Psycho'' (1998)===\n{{Main|Psycho (1998 film)}}\nIn need of money to get her boyfriend Sam Loomis ([[Viggo Mortensen]]) out of debt, [[Marion Crane]] ([[Anne Heche]]) steals $400,000 from her employer and flees [[Phoenix, Arizona]] by car. While en route to Sam's [[California]] home, she parks along the road to sleep. A highway patrol officer awakens her and, suspicious of her agitated state, begins to follow her. When she trades her car for another one at a dealership, he notes the new vehicle's details. Marion returns to the road but, rather than drive in a heavy storm, decides to spend the night at the Bates Motel.  The proprietor, [[Norman Bates]] ([[Vince Vaughn]]), tells Marion he rarely has customers because of a new interstate nearby and mentions he lives with his mother in the house overlooking the motel. He invites Marion to have supper with him. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother about letting Marion in the house, and during the meal she angers him by suggesting he institutionalize his mother. He admits he would like to do so, but does not want to abandon her.\n\nMarion resolves to return to Phoenix to return the money. After calculating how she can repay the money she has spent, Marion dumps her notes down the toilet and begins to shower. An anonymous female figure enters the bathroom and stabs her to death. Finding the corpse, Norman is horrified. He cleans the bathroom and places Marion's body, wrapped in the shower curtain, and all her possessions &mdash; including the money &mdash; in the trunk of her car and sinks it in a nearby swamp...\n\nShortly afterward, Sam is contacted by both Marion's sister [[Lila Crane]] ([[Julianne Moore]]) and private detective Milton Arbogast ([[William H. Macy]]), who has been hired by Marion's employer to find her and recover the money. Arbogast traces Marion to the motel and questions Norman, who unconvincingly lies that Marion stayed for one night and left the following morning. He refuses to let Arbogast talk to his mother, claiming she is ill. Arbogast calls Lila to update her and tells her he will contact her again within an hour after he questions Norman's mother.\n\nArbogast enters Norman's house and at the top of the stairs is attacked by a figure who slashes his face three times with a knife, pushes him down the stairs, then stabs him to death. When Arbogast does not call Lila, she and Sam contact the local police. Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers ([[Philip Baker Hall]]) is perplexed to learn Arbogast saw a woman in a window, since Norman's mother died ten years ago. Norman confronts his mother and urges her to hide in the cellar. She rejects the idea and orders him out of her room, but against her will Norman carries her to the cellar.\n\nPosing as a married couple, Sam and Lila check into the motel and search Marion's room, where they find a scrap of paper in the toilet with \"$400,000\" written on it. While Sam distracts Norman, Lila sneaks into the house to search for his mother. Sam suggests to Norman that he killed Marion for the money so he could buy a new motel. Realizing Lila is not around, Norman knocks Sam unconscious with a golf club and rushes to the house. Lila sees him and hides in the cellar where she discovers the semi-preserved and [[mummy|mummified]] body of Norman's mother. Wearing his mother's clothes and a wig and carrying a knife, Norman enters and tries to attack Lila, but she is rescued by Sam.\n\nAfter Norman's arrest, [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] Dr. Fred Richmond ([[Robert Forster]]) tells Sam and Lila that Norman's dead mother is living in Norman's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as an [[dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]]. After the death of Norman's father, the pair lived as if they were the only people in the world. When his mother found a lover, Norman went over the edge with jealousy and murdered both of them. Consumed with guilt, he tried to \"erase the crime\" by bringing his mother back to life in his mind. He stole her corpse and preserved the body. When he is \"Mother\", he acts, talks, and dresses as she would. Norman imagined his mother would be as jealous of a woman to whom he might be attracted just as he was of his mother's lover, and so \"Mother\" kills any woman he has feelings for; when Norman regains consciousness, he believes that his mother has committed the crime, and covers up for her. It is implied that Norman is responsible for the unsolved disappearances of two young girls. Richmond concludes that the \"Mother\" personality has now taken complete control of Norman's mind.\n\nIn the final scene, Norman sits in a cell, thinking in \"Mother's\" voice. In a voiceover, \"Mother\" explains that she plans to prove to the authorities she is incapable of violence by refusing to swat a fly that has landed on her hand. The final shot shows Marion's car being recovered from the swamp, and then goes to end credits.\n\n==Television series==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" |Series\n! scope=\"col\" |Seasons\n! scope=\"col\" |Episodes\n! scope=\"col\" |First aired\n! scope=\"col\" |Last aired\n! scope=\"col\" |Showrunner(s)\n! scope=\"col\" |Network\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | ''[[Bates Motel (TV series)|Bates Motel]]''\n| 5\n| 50\n| March 18, 2013 \n| April 24, 2017\n| [[Carlton Cuse]], [[Kerry Ehrin]], [[Anthony Cipriano]]\n| [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]]\n|-\n|}\n\n===''Bates Motel'' (2013\u20132017)===\n{{Main|Bates Motel (TV series)}}\nOn January 23, 2012, A&E announced that a television series called ''Bates Motel'' was in development at the network.

Both had deceased, domineering mothers, and had sealed off one room of their house as a shrine to their mother, and both dressed in women's clothing. However, there are many differences between Bates and Ed Gein. Among others, Gein would not be strictly considered a serial killer, having officially killed \"only\" two people.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reavill|2007|p=228}} \"With only two confirmed kills, Ed did not technically qualify as a serial killer (the traditional minimum requirement was three\"</ref> [[Peggy Robertson]], Hitchcock's production assistant, read [[Anthony Boucher]]'s positive review of the Bloch novel and decided to show the book to Hitchcock, even though readers at Hitchcock's home studio [[Paramount Pictures]] rejected its premise for a film. Hitchcock acquired rights to the novel for $9,500.<ref name=\"Leigh6\">Leigh, p. 6</ref> He reportedly ordered Robertson to buy up copies to keep the novel's surprises for the film.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=19\u201320}}</ref> Hitchcock chose to film ''Psycho'' to recover from two aborted projects with Paramount: ''Flamingo Feather'' and ''No Bail for the Judge''. Hitchcock also faced genre competitors whose works were critically compared to his own and so wanted to film new material. The director also disliked stars' salary demands and trusted only a few people to choose prospective material, including Robertson.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=18\u201319}}</ref>\n\nParamount executives did not want to produce the film and refused to provide the budget that Hitchcock received from them for previous films with the studio.<ref name=\"Rebello23\">{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|p=23}}</ref> Hitchcock decided to plan for ''Psycho'' to be filmed quickly and inexpensively, similar to an episode of his ongoing television series ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', and hired the television series crew as Shamley Productions. He proposed this cost-conscious approach to Paramount but executives again refused to finance the film, telling him their sound stages were occupied or booked even though production was known to be in a slump. Hitchcock countered with the offer to finance the film personally and to film it at Universal-International if Paramount would distribute. He also deferred his director's fee of $250,000 for a 60% ownership of the film negative. This offer was finally accepted. Hitchcock also experienced resistance from producer Herbert Coleman and Shamley Productions executive [[Joan Harrison (screenwriter)|Joan Harrison]], who did not think the film would be a success.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=26\u201329}}</ref>\n\nHitchcock hired writer James Cavanaugh to write a draft of the screenplay. Unsatisfied with Cavanaugh's screenplay, Hitchcock then hired up-and-coming writer [[Joseph Stefano]] to adapt the novel. The film began shooting in December 1959 and would go on to last about a month. It was filmed mostly on the backlot of Universal and in various sound stages. During shooting, Hitchcock was forced to uncharacteristically do retakes for some scenes. The final shot in the shower scene, which starts with an extreme close-up on Marion's eye and pulls up and out, proved very difficult for Leigh, since the water splashing in her face made her want to blink, and the cameraman had trouble as well since he had to manually focus while moving the camera. Retakes were also required for the opening scene, since Hitchcock felt that Leigh and Gavin were not passionate enough.<ref>Leigh, p. 55</ref> Leigh had trouble saying \"Not inordinately\" for the real estate office scene, requiring additional retakes.<ref>Leigh, p. 59</ref> Lastly, the scene in which the mother is discovered required complicated coordination of the chair turning around, Miles hitting the light bulb, and a [[lens flare]], which proved to be the sticking point. Hitchcock forced retakes until all three elements were to his satisfaction.<ref>Leigh, pp. 87\u201388</ref> The famous shower scene took a week to complete and took up a third of Janet Leigh's shooting time. ''Psycho'' was released on June 16, 1960 to mixed critical reception and financial success, making thirty-two million dollars in its theatrical run. The film received four Academy Award nominations.\n\nIn 1982, author Robert Bloch published his novel ''Psycho II'', which satirized Hollywood slasher films. Upset by this, Universal decided to make their own version that differed from Bloch's work.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://mgpfeff.home.sprynet.com/leming_interview1.html | title=Interviews - From ''Psycho'' to ''Asylum'': The Horror Films of Robert Bloch | work=The Unofficial Robert Bloch Website | accessdate=2009-08-15}}</ref> Originally, the film was intended as a [[TV movie|made-for-cable]] production.<ref name=boys>[http://retroslashers.net/blog/a-boys-best-friend-pt2-psycho-2-1983/ A Boy's Best Friend - Psycho 2 - Retroslashers.net] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130112034832/http://retroslashers.net/blog/a-boys-best-friend-pt2-psycho-2-1983/ |date=2013-01-12 }}</ref> [[Anthony Perkins]] originally turned down the offer to reprise the role of [[Norman Bates]], but when the studio became interested in others (including [[Christopher Walken]]), Perkins quickly accepted.<ref name=film>[http://www.film.com/movies/psycho-ii/story/erics-time-capsule-psycho-ii/28477842 Eric's Time Capsule: Psycho II (June 3, 1983) - Film.com]</ref> The studio also wanted [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] (daughter of ''Psycho'' star [[Janet Leigh]]) to play the role of Mary Loomis.<ref name=film/> Director [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]] was hired to direct ''Psycho II'' because he was a Hitchcock student and even visited him on the set of ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]'', and because a year earlier, Franklin made a film called ''[[Roadgames]]'' starring Jamie Lee Curtis which was influenced by Hitchcock's 1954 film ''[[Rear Window]]''. Franklin hired writer [[Tom Holland (director)|Tom Holland]] to write the screenplay after Franklin had seen ''The Beast Within'', which Holland had written. Holland stated: \"I approached it with more trepidation because I was doing a sequel to ''Psycho'' and I had an overwhelming respect for Hitchcock. You didn't want to mess it up, you really had almost a moral obligation to make something that stayed true to the original and yet updated it the same time. It really was the next step, what happens when Norman gets out\". The assistant director of the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', [[Hilton A. Green]], was contacted and asked if he wanted to produce the film. Green, fearing that Hitchcock may not have approved of sequels to his films, called Hitchcock's daughter [[Patricia Hitchcock]] and asked what she thought of the film. Patricia Hitchcock gave her blessing to the film, saying that her father would have loved it. ''Psycho II'' was filmed at [[Universal Studios]] in [[Universal City, California]] on Stage 24 from June 30, 1982 to August 1982.<ref name=boys/>\n\nThe Bates house set was still standing from 1960, but the motel had to be reconstructed.<ref name=boys/> According to [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]], filming lasted 32 days. The film was made much like the first film; it was mostly shot on the backlot of Universal and on a number of sound stages. Several props and set pieces from the original film were found by set designers [[John W. Corso]] and Julie Fletcher. The town of Fairvale (seen when Lila Loomis is tailed by Dr. Raymond) is actually [[Courthouse Square]], which is located on the Universal Studios backlot in [[California]]. Both Franklin and Holland wanted the film to be a tribute to Hitchcock and the original film; to accomplish this, they added in various in jokes such as the scene when Mary and Norman first go into Norman's mother's room, before they turn the lights on; one can see Alfred Hitchcock's silhouette on the wall to the far right. Franklin also repeated various shots from the original film such as the shot where Norman walks into the kitchen and sets his jacket down on the chair. Perkins had difficulty working with actress [[Meg Tilly]] due to Tilly never seeing the original film and not being aware of the significance of Perkins' comeback role. Midway through production, Perkins suggested that Tilly be replaced even though half of her scenes had been shot. The ending of the film was kept secret during production. The final pages of the shooting script with the ending on it weren't distributed to cast and crew until the last day of filming. The iconic last shot of the movie with Norman standing in front of the house was used as a Christmas card for various crew members. When Universal presented concept art for the one-sheet film poster, director Franklin wasn't pleased with it. It was editor Andrew London who came up with the idea of using the Christmas card photo as the film poster and also came up with the tagline: \"It's 22 years later and Norman Bates is coming home\". When the film opened on June 3, 1983, it earned $8,310,244 in its opening weekend and went on to gross about $34,725,000, making it one of the top hits of the year, just behind ''[[Return of the Jedi]]''.<ref name=boys/>\n\n''Psycho II'' was generally received well by the public and critics and was a surprise box office success. However, film critics [[Gene Siskel]] and [[Roger Ebert]] both gave the film thumbs down on ''[[At the Movies (1982\u20131990 TV series)|At the Movies]]'', specifically for its failure to live up to the original. \"I think the ghost of the original,\" said Siskel, \"obviously hangs over this movie, and it's too bad because it's a nicely made picture.\" Ebert wrote of the film: \"If you've seen ''Psycho'' a dozen times and can recite the shots in the shower scene by heart, ''Psycho II'' is just not going to do it for you. But if you can accept this 1983 movie on its own terms, as a fresh start, and put your memories of Hitchcock on hold, then ''Psycho II'' begins to work. It's too heavy on plot and too willing to cheat about its plot to be really successful, but it does have its moments, and it's better than your average, run-of-the-mill slasher movie.\"<ref name=\"ebert\">{{Cite news|author=Ebert, Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |title=Psycho (1960) |work=Great Movies |publisher=rogerebert.com |date=1998-12-06 |url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19981206/REVIEWS08/401010353/1023|accessdate=2006-12-01}}</ref> In the British magazine ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'', film critic [[Kim Newman]] gave the film three out of five stars, calling ''Psycho II'' \"a smart, darkly-comic thriller with some imaginative twists\", writing \" The wittiest dark joke is that the entire world ''wants'' Norman to be mad, and \u2018normality\u2019 can only be restored if he\u2019s got a mummified mother in the window and is ready to kill again.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Newman|first=Kim|title=Empire's Psycho II Movie Review|url=https://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=134907|publisher=Empire|accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nWith the surprise financial and critical success of ''Psycho II'', Universal began development on a second sequel. Writer [[Charles Edward Pogue]] was hired to write the screenplay. In Pogue's first draft of the film, it was Duane who was the killer and had intentionally come to the Bates Motel because he was obsessed with Norman. Maureen was a neurotic psychologist who had come to the motel to replace Dr. Raymond from the previous film. Pogue had intended to cast original victim [[Janet Leigh]] in the role. Universal rejected these ideas, arguing that Bates had to be the killer and Leigh was wrong for the film. However, Maureen's actions remained virtually unchanged; her character was merely changed to a young nun. After the second draft of the screenplay was completed, it was sent to Perkins as an acting job. After Perkins read the script, he wanted to direct the film, saying he would do it for nothing. Universal agreed to this. When the film went into pre-production, Anthony Perkins asked ''Psycho II'' director [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]] to co-direct the film with him; however Franklin declined. Filming for ''Psycho III'' began in June 1985. Perkins' main inspiration for the style of this film came from the movie ''[[Blood Simple]]'' directed by the [[Coen brothers]]. Before production began, he even took the entire cast and crew to a screening of the film. Like the two previous films, it was mostly shot on the backlot of Universal and in a number of sound stages. Despite ''Psycho III'' being Perkins' film directorial debut, the cast and crew have said in interviews that he was enjoyable to work with. [[Lee Garlington]], who played the waitress Myrna, stated: \"I have never to this date met a director who worked equally well with both the cast and crew. He was excited to be doing it, I adored him\". During filming, actor [[Jeff Fahey]] suffered an on-set injury. When filming the scene where Norman is hitting Duke with the guitar, Anthony Perkins actually hit Jeff Fahey so hard that it cut his head open and he had to get six stitches. A shot of Fahey's actual injury was used in the final film. Universal originally wanted to release the film in February 1986 but the release was moved to July 2, 1986 due to various re-shoots that included the ending. ''Psycho III'' was released on July 2, 1986 to a mixed response from critics and financial failure. It earned $3,238,400 in its opening weekend and went on to gross about $14,481,606 at the domestic box office, becoming the lowest-grossing theatrical film of the ''Psycho'' movie franchise.<ref name=\"mojo-p3\">{{cite web |url= https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=psycho3.htm |title= Psycho III |website = [[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date= 2011-04-17 }}</ref>\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film three out of five stars, saying: \"Any movie named \"Psycho III\" is going to be compared to the Hitchcock original, but Perkins isn't an imitator. He has his own agenda. He has lived with Norman Bates all these years, and he has some ideas about him, and although the movie doesn't apologize for Norman, it does pity him. For the first time, I was able to see that the true horror in the \"Psycho\" movies isn't what Norman does - but the fact that he is compelled to do it.\" Vincent Canby of ''The New York Times'' said: \"It has a cast of talented, self-effacing actors, who don't upstage the material, and an efficient screenplay by Charles Edward Pogue, who doesn't beat you over the head to prove that he has a sense of humor.\" Ken Hanke of Mountain Xpress called the film a \"superior horror sequel stylishly made by star Anthony Perkins\". Dave Kehr of ''The Chicago Reader'' said: \"Perkins tries to imitate Hitchcock's visual style, but most of the film is made without concern for style of any kind, unless it's the bludgeoning nonstyle of Friday the 13th.\" ''Variety'' called the film \"dependent almost entirely upon self-referential incidents and attitudes for its effect, and it eventually becomes wearying.\"\n\nWith the financial failure of ''Psycho III'', Universal decided to continue the ''Psycho'' franchise as a television series, taking inspiration from the ''[[Friday the 13th (TV series)|Friday the 13th]]'' and ''[[Freddy's Nightmares|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' TV series. In this televised [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''Psycho'', Norman Bates is portrayed by [[Kurt Paul]], who previously stood in as a [[stunt double]] for Anthony Perkins in ''Psycho II'' and ''Psycho III''. Perkins declined involvement in the project and even heavily boycotted it. The film was made as a [[pilot episode|pilot]] for a weekly anthology television series, but the series was never picked up.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092622/trivia|title=Trivia for Bates Motel|publisher=imdb.com|accessdate=2011-04-17}}</ref> Thus, Universal decided to air the pilot as a made-for-TV film over the [[Independence Day (United States)|4th of July]] weekend. The film received mostly negative reviews and low Nielson ratings.\n\nA year after ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' aired, production on ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' began. Perkins wanted to direct the film and even came up with a pitch for the film along with ''Psycho III'' screenwriter Charles Edward Pogue; however ''Psycho III'' was a critical and financial failure so Universal rejected that idea and [[Mick Garris]] was brought in.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/54/psychoiv.php |title=Who Owns Norman Bates? |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=November 2006 |work= |publisher=Bright Lights Film Journal |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> [[Joseph Stefano]] was the screenwriter of the original film and was brought back to write the fourth film. He had disliked the two films between I and IV, feeling that they were too commercial and catered to the conventions of slasher movies. In an interview, Stefano stated \"Gearing up for ''Psycho IV'', I decided to ignore the two sequels \u2013 like the business in II about Norman\u2019s mother.\"<ref>[http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2008/09/interview-psycho-screenwriter-joseph-stefano/ Interview: Psycho Screenwriter Joseph Stefano By Steve Biodrowski \u2022 September 16, 2008]</ref>\n\nActress [[Olivia Hussey]] was directly offered the role of Mrs. Bates.

In the documentary ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'', Thomas stated: \"Looking back on it now, he knew he had to have this conversation with me but I don't think that he was really into it. He just gave me a few broad strokes and told me to play the character real, that was it.\"<ref>{{cite video |people=Robert V.

Director Mick Garris has stated in numerous interviews that he had some creative control issues with Perkins. \"He would get into long, drawn-out discussions in front of the crew, testing his director, making sure choices were not made \"because it looks good\", and seeing how deep the understanding of the story and process were. He could be very forceful, just shy of bullying, but also really appreciated helpful direction. I would have to say he was the most difficult and challenging actor I've ever worked with, but he ended up going on and on about how happy he was with the film. That was gratifying\", Garris says.<ref>[http://www.thepsychomovies.com/films/psycho4/mgarris.html Interview with Director Mick Garris at \"The Psycho Movies\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401083024/http://www.thepsychomovies.com/films/psycho4/mgarris.html |date=2012-04-01 }}</ref>\n\n''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' was filmed at [[Universal Studios Florida]] in [[Orlando, Florida]] from June 4 to July 13, 1990. The facade of the Bates Motel and the Bates mansion were re-created at the theme park. The production was originally to be filmed before the opening of the park but due to delays and the studio's desire to have a high-profile production on the lot, the film was shot while the park was open. This led to tourists being able to watch the filming of several scenes at the motel and house on the back lot.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews when first broadcast on Showtime. Henry Stewart of ''L Magazine'' said: \"Garris evinces high-grade professionalism, but his comic-book approximations of real emotions\u2014like desire, madness and murderlust\u2014feel empty. Hitchcock this most certainly ain't.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thelmagazine.com/newyork/psycho-the-book-the-sequels/Content?oid=1794136 |title=Psycho, the Book, the Sequels |author=Mark Asch and Henry Stewart |date= |work= |publisher=The L Magazine |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> Ninja Dixon.com stated: \"This is a good TV movie, way better than {{sic|it's}} reputation, and continues the tradition of great acting in the series.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ninjadixon.blogspot.com/2009/08/psycho-iv-beginning-1990.html |title=Psycho IV: The Beginning (1990) |author=Ninja Dixon |date=August 6, 2009 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> Cult Reviews.com said: \"The film is shot well, the fire sequence, by Rodney Charters, is particularly stunning.

Some changes are pervasive: as the film opens, it is made clear that it is set in the late 1990s, so minor changes are made throughout the dialogue to reflect the new timeframe. For example, all the references to money are updated (how much Marion Crane steals, how much a car costs, how much a hotel room costs), as are references to terms from the original script like \"[[aspic]]\" that would seem [[Anachronism|anachronistic]] in the new setting.\n\nAccording to Van Sant, in the original the only fully fleshed-out character was [[Norman Bates]]; the other major characters were more iconic, purposely written and portrayed to advance the plot. Van Sant relied upon his main cast more to flesh out and make consistent their character's motivations and worked with them to determine to what degree their characters were similar to the originals. William H. Macy chose to stay true to the original, while others, such as Vaughn and Julianne Moore, interpreted the dialogue and scenes from the original film differently. Moore's version of Lila Crane was much more aggressive than the one portrayed by [[Vera Miles]], and there are differences in Marion Crane's evolving attitudes about the money she stole.\n\nThe [[cinematography]] and [[cinematic techniques]] were consistent between the two films in many memorable scenes, including the shower scene, scenes of the mother, scenes of the swamp, and the scene of Arbogast on the staircase, but other scenes changed significantly, particularly the climax, and the Dr. Simon monologue at the end, which was much shorter. Van Sant's comments from the commentary track attributes many of the updates to the need to make the film more accessible to a new audience.\n\nThe film earned $37,141,130 at the box office, $21,456,130 of which came from North America.<ref name=\"mojo-p1998\">{{mojo title|id=psycho98|title=Psycho (1998)}}</ref> Estimates of the production budget range from $20 million<ref>[https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1998/PSYCH.php ''Psych'' (1998)] from The Numbers</ref> to $60 million;<ref name=\"mojo-p1998\"/> while promoting his 2002 film ''[[Gerry (2002 film)|Gerry]]'', Van Sant said he thought the producers \"broke even\" financially.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.webwombat.com.au/entertainment/movies/gus-van-sant-int.htm| title=Gus Vant Sant: Exclusive Interview| last=Morris| first=Clint| publisher=Web Wombat| accessdate=2009-03-30}}</ref>\n\nThis version of ''Psycho'' received mostly negative reviews; it was awarded two [[Golden Raspberry Awards]] for [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off or Sequel|Worst Remake or Sequel]] and [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Director|Worst Director]] for Gus Van Sant, while Anne Heche was nominated as [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress|Worst Actress]].

Many people refer to this film as a duplicate of the [[Psycho (1960 film)|1960 film]] rather than a remake. Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] wrote that the film \"demonstrates that a shot-by-shot remake is pointless; genius apparently resides between or beneath the shots, or in chemistry that cannot be timed or counted.\"<ref>{{cite news | url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19981206/REVIEWS/812060301/1023 | title=Review of Psycho (1998 film) | first=Roger | last=Ebert | date=1998-12-06 | authorlink=Roger Ebert | accessdate=2007-11-03 | work=Chicago Sun-Times}}</ref> Screenwriter [[Joseph Stefano]], who worked on the 1960 version, thought that although she spoke the same lines, Anne Heche portrays Marion Crane as an entirely different character.<ref>{{cite news | title=Psycho Analysis: An Interview With Screenwriter Joseph Stefano | url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid%3A74285 | publisher=[[The Austin Chronicle]] | date=1999-10-15 | accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref> Even Van Sant admitted that it was an experiment that proved that no one can really copy a film exactly the same way as the original.<ref>{{cite news | title=The odd world of Gus Van Sant | url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/07/14/news/gus.php | publisher=[[International Herald Tribune]] | date=2005-07-15 | accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref> [[Janet Maslin]] gave the film a positive review, calling it an \"artful, good-looking remake (a modest term, but it beats plagiarism) that shrewdly revitalizes the aspects of the real ''Psycho'' (1960) that it follows most faithfully but seldom diverges seriously or successfully from one of the cinema's most brilliant blueprints\"; she noted that the \"absence of anything like [[Anthony Perkins]]'s sensational performance with that vitally birdlike presence and sneaky way with a [[Double entendre|double-entendre]] (\"A boy's best friend is his mother\") is the new film's greatest weakness.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D0DE7DD1E3BF936A35751C1A96E958260| title=The Mama's Boy, His Motel Guest And That Shower| last=Maslin| first=Janet| authorlink=Janet Maslin| publisher=[[The New York Times]]| date=December 5, 1998| accessdate=2009-03-30}}</ref> Critic [[Leonard Maltin]] gave the film a rating of one out of four stars, or \"BOMB\" compared to the four stars he gave the original.

''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'' (1998), a shot-for-shot [[remake]] of the first film is not a sequel since it retells the same events as the original film, but set in 1998. There are also some continuity problems in ''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' that have to do with some of the past events explored in ''Psycho'', ''Psycho II'', and ''Psycho III''. Reflecting on the continuity issues, Robert Price writes \"It seems that all the different Psychos drift into and out of one another. There is no real sequence. All are variant versions of the same myth. The deep conflict being rehearsed and resolved in these movies is that of the [[Oedipus complex|Oedipal complex]].\"\n\n==Home media==\n[[File:Psycho DVD set.JPG|thumb|right|200px|2003 DVD box set of the first four main films ([[United Kingdom|UK]]).]]\n''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'', ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'', the ''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'' remake and ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' have been released on [[VHS]].

Russell (cinematographer)|John L. Russell]] and Best Art Direction for [[Joseph Hurley (art director)|Joseph Hurley]], [[Robert Clatworthy (art director)|Robert Clatworthy]] and [[George Milo]]. All three sequels have been nominated for [[Saturn Awards]]: ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'' for Best Supporting Actress ([[Meg Tilly]]); ''[[Psycho III]]'' for Best Horror Film and Best Actor ([[Anthony Perkins]]); and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' for Best Genre Television Series.\n\n===Legacy===\n''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' has become one of the most recognizable films ever made. The shower scene alone has become one of the most iconic cut scenes in cinematic history. ''Psycho'' is frequently referenced, given homage to or spoofed in television shows such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[American Dad!]]'', ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'', ''[[Maude (TV series)|Maude]]'', ''[[The Golden Girls]]'' and more. Films such as ''[[Scream 2]]'', ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', ''[[Throw Momma from the Train]]'', ''[[Scary Movie]]'' and more have referenced the film. Many critics and filmmakers have cited ''Psycho'' as the film that modernized the horror genre. Horror writer David. J. Schow stated (in ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'') \"It brought the idea that the killer in a horror film was not a mutant, didn't have dents in his head; he could look like that nice young boy from next door\". The film also brought in a new level of acceptable violence and sexuality in movies. Both [[Anthony Perkins]] and [[Janet Leigh]] spent the rest of their careers being typecasted by the film. Even [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s films began to decline in critical and financial popularity after the release of ''Psycho''. Hitchcock film scholars argue that for the rest of his career, Hitchcock's films were constantly being compared to ''Psycho''. The \"Psycho\" films still maintain a very large fanbase. Various websites dedicated to the franchise such as ''The Psycho Movies.com'' have appeared on the Internet. Books detailing the making and impact of the film such as ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]'', ''The Moment of Psycho'', Janet Leigh's ''Psycho: Behind The Scenes of the Classic Thriller'' have been published over the years. Two retrospective documentaries have been released detailing the making of all four films including ''The Making of Psycho'' (1997) and ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'' (2010). The film also spawned the show ''[[Alfred Hitchcock: The Art of Making Movies (attraction)|Alfred Hitchcock: The Art of Making Movies]]'' at [[Universal Studios Florida]], with part of the show detailing how the shower scene was filmed. In 1992, ''Psycho'' was added to the [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]].\n\nA musical stage adaptation, ''Psycho: The Musical'', was performed January 25 to February 9, 2019 at PULP Black Box Theatre in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]]. <ref>https://www.facebook.com/events/1973956552682770/</ref>\n\n==Other media and merchandise==\n\nVarious ''Psycho'' related merchandise has been sold ever since the release of the original film. Merchandise includes T-shirts, posters, DVDs, books, stationery, shot glasses, shower curtains, action figures, model house kits, pens and more. Much of the merchandise is related to the fictional Bates Motel where items commonly found in an actual motel have the Bates Motel logo on them. A Bates Motel light up sign was released in 2009. To coincide with the 50th anniversary of the release of the original film, a Psycho house model kit was released in the U.S. Props from all the films are also sold occasionally on [[eBay]]. The original one sheet poster for ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' is worth around $3000 in mint condition. The original one sheets for ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' are worth around $50 each.\n\n===Graphic novels===\nIn 1992, a series of [[graphic novel]]s based on the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' was published by the Innovation Comics group. Today, the novels are out of print and are very rare to find.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n===The ''Psycho'' House and Bates Motel sets===\nThe Bates House and Motel were constructed on the backlot at [[Universal Studios Hollywood|Universal City Studios]] in 1959 for the production of ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''. It has been said that the house, designed by art directors [[Joseph Hurley (art director)|Joseph Hurley]] and [[Robert Clatworthy (art director)|Robert Clathworthy]], was loosely based on an [[Edward Hopper]] painting called \"House by the Railroad\". The house and motel sets were actually empty shells, also known as facades. When the house was originally built, there was no right side of the house, since the right side is never seen on camera in the original ''Psycho'' film. Interiors of the Bates house and motel were constructed on Sound stage 18-A at Universal, just a short walk from the actual exterior locations making production convenient for all involved. After production had wrapped on ''Psycho'', the house was featured in several television productions including ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'', ''[[Wagon Train]]'' and ''[[Thriller (American TV series)|Boris Karloff's Thriller]]''.\n\nIn 1964, Universal Studios opened its patented [[Studio Tour|Studio Tram Tour]]. The right side of the house was then added and the set was unceremoniously dubbed \"The Psycho House\". The house and even the motel went on to appear in several shows such as ''[[Night Gallery]]'', ''[[The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries]]'' and even in films such as ''[[Invitation to a Gunfighter]]'' and ''[[Modern Problems]]''. The motel was torn down in 1979 and the house was moved to an alternate location on the backlot to accommodate the new tour. In 1982, Richard Franklin and Hilton A. Green announced plans to film ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]''. The house was then moved to a location that best matched the original hill and only about 40 feet of the motel was actually re-built. The rest of the motel in the film was a matte painting. TV shows during the '80s promoted the Universal Tour and prominently featured the Psycho House including ''[[Amazing Stories (1985 TV series)|Amazing Stories]]'', ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]'' and ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]''.\n\nIn 1985, the Bates Motel was fully re-built for the filming of ''[[Psycho III]]''. In 1987, the NBC-TV network announced plans for the TV pilot ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]''. The motel in the film was re-modeled to look very Spanish like. This version of the set remained until 1994 when the new renovations were taken away and the motel was put back to look the way it did in the original Psycho. A 1992 episode of ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'' called \"Incident in Lot 7\" featured the Psycho House and Bates Motel as key locations in the popular [[Angela Lansbury]] series.\n\nIn 1988, plans for ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' were underway at Universal. Plans to shoot the movie in Orlando, Florida were set into motion and the film crew constructed a full-scale replica of the Bates Motel and Psycho House at the soon-to-be built [[Universal Studios Florida]]. The final dressing and painting was done by the Psycho IV art department crew in 1990, but the house and motel was fully built in 1988 long before the production team was assembled for the project. After production wrapped, the sets were left as attractions at the park until 1999 when it was torn down to make room for another attraction.\n\nIn 1998, the Psycho House in California was renovated to preserve the set. All of the rotting wood was replaced and the set had a new paint job. That same year, plans to remake ''Psycho'' were announced. It was originally announced that Gus Van Sant was going to be using the original house and motel sets. However, the production team built a new house directly in front of the old one, and the motel was updated to look like it was from the 1960s. The new house was moved next to the original house and remained there for about three years after production. In 2003, due to popular demand, the remake's house was torn down and the motel was restored to the original way once again. To this day, the house and motel are still standing on the backlot of Universal and continue to be major tourist attractions. The [[Studio Tour|tram tour]] features an actor playing Norman Bates coming out of cabin 1 with a body, putting it in the trunk of a car and then wielding a large knife at the tourists as the tram drives away.\n\n===''24 Hour Psycho''===\nAn art installation, ''[[24 Hour Psycho]]'', created by artist [[Douglas Gordon]] in 1993, and later installed in the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York, consists of a silent screening of ''Psycho'', slowed down to two frames per second (from the usual 24), so that it lasts 24 hours rather than 109 minutes. ''24 Hour Psycho'' is featured prominently in [[Don DeLillo]]'s 2010 novel ''[[Point Omega]]''.\n\n===''The Psycho Legacy'' (2010)===\n{{Main|The Psycho Legacy}}\nIn 2010, a [[direct-to-video|direct-to-DVD]] documentary was released called ''The Psycho Legacy''. It included interviews with cast and crew from all four ''Psycho'' films. It also featured interviews with current horror filmmakers who are fans of the series. The documentary was written, produced and directed by horror journalist Robert Galluzzo. Galluzo made the documentary because of the lack of information on the sequels and also to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the release of the original film. The documentary discussed the impact and legacy of the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' and the production stories of ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]''. To the surprise of some critics and fans, the failed TV pilot ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' and the [[Gus Van Sant]] [[Psycho (1998 film)|remake]] were not discussed in the documentary, however originally in the deleted scenes section on the DVD two short segments on the two films were supposed to be on there, however for unknown reasons they were left off of the DVD when it was released. The documentary sold well, received mostly positive reviews and garnered new interest in the series from horror fans.\n\n===''Hitchcock'' (2012)===\n{{Main|Hitchcock (film)}}\nOn April 13, 2012, production started on a film adaptation of [[Stephen Rebello]]'s non-fiction book ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]'', which follows the complex relationship between [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and wife [[Alma Reville]] during the filming of ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' in 1959. The film is directed by [[Sacha Gervasi]] and stars [[Anthony Hopkins]] as director [[Alfred Hitchcock]], Helen Mirren as his wife [[Alma Reville]], [[Scarlett Johansson]] as [[Janet Leigh]], [[Jessica Biel]] as [[Vera Miles]], and [[James D'Arcy]] as [[Anthony Perkins]]. Produced by [[The Montecito Picture Company]] and distributed by [[Searchlight Pictures|Fox Searchlight Pictures]], the film was released on November 23, 2012 in selected cities with a worldwide release on December 14, 2012. The film has received mixed reviews from critics and moderate box office returns, with a worldwide gross of $5,337,378 as of January 3, 2013.\n\n===''78/52'' documentary (2017) ===\n\nA documentary examination of the ''Psycho'' shower scene was released on October 13, 2017 by director [[Alexandre O. Philippe]] running 91 minutes. The cast of participants included [[Guillermo del Toro]], [[Peter Bogdanovich]], [[Bret Easton Ellis]], [[Jamie Lee Curtis]], [[Karyn Kusama]], [[Eli Roth]], [[Oz Perkins]], [[Leigh Whannell]], [[Walter Murch]], [[Danny Elfman]], [[Elijah Wood]], [[Richard Stanley (director)|Richard Stanley]] and [[Neil Marshall]].<ref>. {{cite web | date = January 24, 2017 | author = Owen Gleiberman | url = https://variety.com/2017/film/reviews/7852-review-psycho-1201966555/ | title = Film Review: \u201878/52: Hitchcock\u2019s Shower Scene\u2019 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety Magazine]] }}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* [[Janet Leigh|Leigh, Janet]]; Nickens, Christopher (1995).

(formerly '''Angel Studios, Inc.''') is an American [[video game developer]] and a studio of [[Rockstar Games]] based in [[Carlsbad, California]]. Founded by [[Colombians|Colombian]] artist and businessman Diego Angel in 1984, the company initially focused on animations and [[visual effects]] for multimedia productions, including films and [[music video]]s. Following Angel's business strategy of avoiding high-risk business sectors, the company began working in the [[video game industry]] during the 1990s. Its first video game projects were [[Ed Annunziata]]'s ''[[Ecco: The Tides of Time]]'' (1994) and ''[[Mr. Bones (video game)|Mr. Bones]]'' (1996), for which Angel Studios created [[cutscene]]s.\n\nThe company developed its own games in association with [[Nintendo]] (''[[Major League Baseball Featuring Ken Griffey Jr.]]'' and ''[[Ken Griffey Jr.'s Slugfest]]'') and [[Microsoft]] (''[[Midtown Madness]]'' and ''[[Midtown Madness 2]]''), and produced a [[Porting|port]] of [[Capcom]]'s ''[[Resident Evil 2]]'' for the [[Nintendo 64]]. Impressed with the studio's work on ''Midtown Madness'', Rockstar Games approached Angel Studios with a long-term partnership in 1999, which resulted in the creation of video game series ''[[Midnight Club]]'' and ''[[Smuggler's Run]]''.\n\nIn November 2002, Angel Studios was acquired by [[Take-Two Interactive]] (Rockstar Games' parent company) and became part of Rockstar Games as Rockstar San Diego. Since 2004, Rockstar San Diego has housed an internal [[game engine]] team that develops the [[Rockstar Advanced Game Engine]] (RAGE), Rockstar Games' proprietary engine used in most titles developed by its studios for [[personal computer]]s and [[Video game console|consoles]]. Rockstar San Diego led development of the 2010 game ''[[Red Dead Redemption]]'' and its [[expansion pack]] ''[[Undead Nightmare]]'', and collaborated with other Rockstar Games studios on ''[[Max Payne 3]]'' (2012), ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'' (2013), and ''[[Red Dead Redemption 2]]'' (2018).\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Beginnings, partnerships, and ''Resident Evil 2'' port (1984\u20132000) ===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Diego Angel.jpg|thumb|left|Diego Angel founded Angel Studios in 1984 and served as its [[President (corporate title)|president]] until 2005.<ref name=\"San Diego U-T: Before the bubble\" /><ref name=\"Polygon: How\" />]] -->\nColombian artist and businessman Diego Angel founded Angel Studios in 1984 in [[Carlsbad, California]], as a [[work-for-hire]] studio that created [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]].<ref name=\"San Diego U-T: Before the bubble\" /><ref name=\"Polygon: How\" /> Founding partners included Brad Hunt, Michael Limber, and Angel's [[brother-in-law]], of whom Limber became the company's [[chief creative officer]].<ref name=\"Playing at the Next Level: Page 262\" /><ref name=\"VentureBeat: CCO\" /> Angel employed a philosophy he called the \"three P's\" (passion, patience, and perseverance), which meant that he would not accept any offer simply because it came his way;

Capcom's [[Yoshiki Okamoto]] then approached Angel Studios with the idea for an original [[intellectual property]] entitled ''S.W.A.T.''.<ref name=\"Polygon: How\" /> It later adopted a [[Western (genre)|Western]] theme at Okamoto's recommendation, redefining the acronym as \"Spaghetti Western Action Team\".<ref name=\"Polygon: How\" /> Angel Studios began work on the game with Capcom's oversight and funding in 2000, and the latter announced the game in March 2002.<ref name=\"IGN: Red Dead Interview\" /><ref name=\"IGN: Capcom Unveils\" /> Its development was troubled, partially due to cultural differences between the two companies, and the game remained unplayable.<ref name=\"Polygon: How\" /> ''Red Dead Revolver'' missed the 2002 [[European Computer Trade Show]] and 2003 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] (E3).<ref name=\"IGN: Capcom TGS\" /><ref name=\"GameSpot: status update\" /> Okamoto then left Capcom,<ref name=\"Polygon: How\" /> which stopped funding the game in July 2003 and announced in August of that year that the game was canceled.<ref name=\"GameSpot: Capcom no longer\" /><ref name=\"GameSpot: Capcom cancels\" /> Rockstar Games acquired the rights to ''Red Dead Revolver'' in December, and resumed its development.<ref name=\"GameSpot: Rockstar rescues\" /><ref name=\"IGN: Rockstar Announces\" /> The game's \"[[Video game developer#\"Crunch time\"|crunch time]]\" increased for as rapid a release as possible, and it was released in May 2004 for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox.<ref name=\"Polygon: How\" />\n\nRockstar San Diego began developing ''Agent'', an open-world [[stealth game]] for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox, in 2003.<ref name=\"Polygon: Agent\" /><ref name=\"VG247: Another E3\" /> The development team leadership was mostly as the same as that of Rockstar San Diego's 2001 game ''[[Transworld Surf]]'', headed up by [[Video game producer|producer]] Luis Gigliotti.<ref name=\"Polygon: Agent\" /> In favor of developing ''Agent'', the team ceased work on an untitled [[Justice League]] game that was still being conceptualized.<ref name=\"Polygon: Agent\" /> Unlike prior Angel Studios games, ''Agent'' began a prototype stage with a full-size team.<ref name=\"Polygon: Agent\" /> This team was given little time to complete this prototype, leading to much \"[[Video game developer#\"Crunch time\"|crunch]]\" at the studio.<ref name=\"Polygon: Agent\" /> Rockstar Games also removed studio-wide vacations after successfully reaching milestones or launching a game, a change many employees felt was abrupt.<ref name=\"Polygon: Agent\" /> Some Rockstar San Diego artists traveled to [[Cairo]] and [[Washington, D.C.]], two locations ''Agent'' was to be set in.<ref name=\"Polygon: Agent\" /> The four artists that traveled to Cairo took \"over 10,000\" of such photographs.<ref name=\"Kotaku: Talking To The PS4\" /> In both cases, artists were detained by the local police forces; it was resolved quickly in D.C. but took significantly longer for those situated in Cairo.<ref name=\"Polygon: Agent\" /> However, both teams could eventually return with the photographs they had taken and development was able to continue.<ref name=\"Polygon: Agent\" /> At the same time, Rockstar Games and the Houser brothers kept requesting changes so frequently that the studio was not able to keep up, leading to overwork and more crunch.<ref name=\"Polygon: Agent\" /> Around this time, three people connected to the studio (one active employee and two former employees) died.<ref name=\"Polygon: Agent\" /> This combined also made for a toxic studio culture.<ref name=\"Polygon: Agent\" /> After a year of work, Gigliotti left the studio and formed the studio Concrete Games in conjunction with publisher [[THQ]], followed by eleven of ''Agent''{{'s}} leads also leaving Rockstar San Diego to join Gigliotti's new studio on the next day.<ref name=\"Polygon: Agent\" /> To compensate for these departures, ''Red Dead Revolver'' developers were put in charge for ''Agent'' after ''Red Dead Revolver'' was released.<ref name=\"Polygon: Agent\" /> Under the new leadership, the studio spent another year upgrading its internal [[game engine]] for use within ''Agent''.<ref name=\"Polygon: Agent\" /> Shortly thereafter, the game was put on hold indefinitely.<ref name=\"VG247: Agent listed\" />\n\nAfter Criterion Games was acquired by [[Electronic Arts]] in 2004, Rockstar San Diego established [[RAGE Technology Group]]: an in-studio team to develop the [[Rockstar Advanced Game Engine]] (RAGE), its proprietary game engine.<ref name=\"GameStar: RAGE\" /> The engine was introduced in ''[[Rockstar Games Presents Table Tennis]]'', also developed by Rockstar San Diego and released for [[Xbox 360]] and [[Wii]] in 2006.<ref name=\"Kotaku: That Time\" /> RAGE remains under development and is used in most of Rockstar Games' personal computer and [[Video game console|console]] titles, including ''[[Red Dead Redemption]]'', ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]'', ''[[Max Payne 3]]'', ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'' and ''[[Red Dead Redemption 2]]''.<ref name=\"Digital Spy: Table Tennis\" /><ref name=\"Eurogamer: RAGE\" /> Diego Angel left Rockstar San Diego in 2005 to return to his hometown in Colombia.<ref name=\"Polygon: How\" /> Alan Wasserman, who had joined Rockstar San Diego in 2003, replaced Angel and became the studio's [[general manager]].<ref name=\"Gamasutra: Angel in Disguise\" /> By January 2006, the studio began searching for new talent to produce next-generation games.<ref name=\"IGN: Prepares for Next-Gen\" />\n\n=== Controversy, ''Red Dead Redemption'', and layoffs (2006\u20132011) ===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Red Dead Redemption.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Many critics claim ''Red Dead Redemption'' (cover pictured) to be, Rockstar San Diego's greatest work so far, and one of Rocksar Games' best releases ever.<ref name=\"San Diego U-T: Rockstar conquers\" />]] -->\nTerri-Kim Chuckry and Garrett Flynn, former Rockstar San Diego [[Video game artist|3D artists]], filed a [[class action]] lawsuit on behalf of themselves and over one hundred other ex-employees against the company on August 26, 2006, claiming unpaid overtime compensation.<ref name=\"Engadget: Lawsuit\" /> The case, ''Garrett Flynn, et al. v.

(formerly '''Angel Studios, Inc.''') is an American [[video game developer]] and a studio of [[Rockstar Games]] based in [[Carlsbad, California]]. Founded by [[Colombians|Colombian]] artist and businessman Diego Angel in 1984, the company initially focused on animations and [[visual effects]] for multimedia productions, including films and [[music video]]s. Following Angel's business strategy of avoiding high-risk business sectors, the company began working in the [[video game industry]] during the 1990s. Its first video game projects were [[Ed Annunziata]]'s ''[[Ecco: The Tides of Time]]'' (1994) and ''[[Mr. Bones (video game)|Mr. Bones]]'' (1996), for which Angel Studios created [[cutscene]]s.\n\nThe company developed its own games in association with [[Nintendo]] (''[[Major League Baseball Featuring Ken Griffey Jr.]]'' and ''[[Ken Griffey Jr.'s Slugfest]]'') and [[Microsoft]] (''[[Midtown Madness]]'' and ''[[Midtown Madness 2]]''), and produced a [[Porting|port]] of [[Capcom]]'s ''[[Resident Evil 2]]'' for the [[Nintendo 64]]. Impressed with the studio's work on ''Midtown Madness'', Rockstar Games approached Angel Studios with a long-term partnership in 1999, which resulted in the creation of video game series ''[[Midnight Club]]'' and ''[[Smuggler's Run]]''.\n\nIn November 2002, Angel Studios was acquired by [[Take-Two Interactive]] (Rockstar Games' parent company) and became part of Rockstar Games as Rockstar San Diego. Since 2004, Rockstar San Diego has housed an internal [[game engine]] team that develops the [[Rockstar Advanced Game Engine]] (RAGE), Rockstar Games' proprietary engine used in most titles developed by its studios for [[personal computer]]s and [[Video game console|consoles]]. Rockstar San Diego led development of the 2010 game ''[[Red Dead Redemption]]'' and its [[expansion pack]] ''[[Undead Nightmare]]'', and collaborated with other Rockstar Games studios on ''[[Max Payne 3]]'' (2012), ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'' (2013), and ''[[Red Dead Redemption 2]]'' (2018).\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Beginnings, partnerships, and ''Resident Evil 2'' port (1984\u20132000) ===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Diego Angel.jpg|thumb|left|Diego Angel founded Angel Studios in 1984 and served as its [[President (corporate title)|president]] until 2005.<ref name=\"San Diego U-T: Before the bubble\" /><ref name=\"Polygon: How\" />]] -->\nColombian artist and businessman Diego Angel founded Angel Studios in 1984 in [[Carlsbad, California]], as a [[work-for-hire]] studio that created [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]].<ref name=\"San Diego U-T: Before the bubble\" /><ref name=\"Polygon: How\" /> Founding partners included Brad Hunt, Michael Limber, and Angel's [[brother-in-law]], of whom Limber became the company's [[chief creative officer]].<ref name=\"Playing at the Next Level\" /><ref name=\"VentureBeat: CCO\" /> Angel employed a philosophy he called the \"three P's\" (passion, patience, and perseverance), which meant that he would not accept any offer simply because it came his way; instead, he opted for projects that showcased his team and their technology.<ref name=\"Polygon: How\" /> According to Angel Studios employees, Angel treated them like family, paying them well, giving them plenty of vacation time, and sharing a bottle of [[Patr\u00f3n]] [[tequila]] with them at the \"Sippy Wippy\" he occasionally held on Friday afternoons.<ref name=\"Polygon: How\" /><ref name=\"Polygon: Agent\" /> Much of the 3D work produced by Angel Studios were films and [[music video]]s.<ref name=\"Polygon: How\" /><ref name=\"Igromania: World Fame\" /> It was most successful with the [[computer-generated imagery]] and [[visual effects]] in the film ''[[The Lawnmower Man (film)|The Lawnmower Man]]'' and the music video for [[Peter Gabriel]]'s \"Kiss That Frog\", both released in 1992.<ref name=\"Polygon: How\" /><ref name=\"Destructoid: Pixel\" /><ref name=\"Game Informer: Unlikely Movie Games\" /> The video for \"Kiss That Frog\" received the Best Special Effects in a Video award at the [[1994 MTV Video Music Awards]].<ref name=\"Polygon: How\" /><ref name=\"The Free Library: Dream Team\" /> For ''The Lawnmower Man'', Angel Studios produced two major scenes;

this led him to approach the video game business.<ref name=\"San Diego U-T: Before the bubble\" /> Limber cited Angel's business model as the biggest factor in the company's survival of the [[dot-com bubble]], which severely impacted the [[San Diego County, California|San Diego-area]] multimedia industry.<ref name=\"San Diego U-T: Before the bubble\" /> Around this time, Angel Studios accepted game designer [[Ed Annunziata]]'s pitch to create [[cutscene]]s for the [[Sega CD]] version of ''[[Ecco: The Tides of Time]]''.<ref name=\"Playing at the Next Level\" /> Annunziata was pleased with the result and invited Angel Studios to work on cutscenes for his next game, ''[[Mr. Bones (video game)|Mr. Bones]]'', for the [[Sega Saturn]].<ref name=\"Playing at the Next Level\" /> ''Mr. Bones'' was released in 1996, with Angel Studios contributing the cutscenes and additional artwork.<ref name=\"Polygon: How\" /><ref name=\"Igromania: World Fame\" />\n\n{{Quote box |text=I was the only company in video games, the only [American] studio in those days, that was working and getting along with the Japanese.

The show revolves around the titular characters: the cats Oggy, Jack and the cockroaches Joey, Marky, and Dee Dee. When the show started airing in 1998, it was successful in France and was eventually broadcast worldwide.\n\n==Synopsis==\nOggy, an [[anthropomorphic]] cat, would prefer to spend his days watching television and eating, but is continuously pestered by three roaches, Joey, Dee Dee and Marky (all named after members of the [[punk rock]] band [[Ramones]]). The Cockroaches' slapstick mischief ranges from plundering Oggy's refrigerator to hijacking the train he just boarded. There are two additional main characters: Oggy's cousin Jack, who is more violent and short-tempered than him and is also annoyed by the Cockroaches; and Bob, a short-tempered bulldog who is Oggy's neighbor.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of Oggy and the Cockroaches episodes}}\n{{section#h|Series overview|page=List of Oggy and the Cockroaches episodes}}\n\n==Characters==\n===Main===\n* Oggy is a cat with a light blue body, green eyes, grey tummy and white feet,first seen in \"Pilot\". Oggy usually spends his time either watching TV or doing housework \u2014 when not chasing the cockroaches. Despite the constant mayhem caused by the cockroaches, Oggy has developed a sort of [[love\u2013hate relationship]] with them, having lived with them for a long time. In the episode \"The Ghost Hunter\", Oggy kills the cockroaches but is terrorized by the spirits. Whenever he finds himself alone in his house, he will eventually begin to miss the cockroaches along with their pranks (as seen in the episode \"Priceless Roaches\" and \"So Lonely\") followed by nothing interesting happening in his life. Oggy's house appears bigger on the inside, mainly featured in the roller coaster-like staircase scenes. According to executive producer [[Marc du Pontavice]] and [[France Info]], the character of Oggy was named after punk rock musician [[Iggy Pop]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.commeaucinema.com/interviews/oggy-et-les-cafards-le-film-animation-comedie,289933|title=Interview with Marc du Pontavice|accessdate=14 January 2014|language=French}}</ref> and the rock album [[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.franceinfo.fr/emission/cartoon-story/2014-ete/oggy-et-les-cafards-08-06-2014-09-55|title=Article on Oggy and the Cockroaches|date=29 July 2014|accessdate=10 August 2014|language=French}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ladepeche.fr/article/2014/09/18/1954159-oggy-superstar-made-in-france.html|title=La D\u00e9p\u00eache interview|accessdate=19 September 2014|language=French}}</ref> In early episodes, Oggy, like his   [[Tom Cat|Tom and Jerry counterpart]] was the main punching bag in the series. However, in more recent episodes, Oggy has been portrayed as heroic, often triumphing over the cockroaches despite the beatings he takes from them and Bob. Notable other accomplishments include winning the Formula 1, placing first in a marathon, and ultimately winning over his girlfriend Olivia.\n*The Cockroaches are three brothers who antagonize other characters, mainly Oggy and Jack,first seen in \"Pilot\". The cockroaches love pranking them so much, that if the cats were to leave, they would miss them (as seen in the episode \"Moving Out\"). It is also implied that the roaches are named after members of the rock band, [[The Ramones]].\n** Joey (born 15 June 1991)<ref>{{cite episode|season=4|title=Let's Party, Guys!|series=Oggy and the Cockroaches|number=201|credits=Olivier Jean-Marie (director, writer), Fred Mintoff (storyboard)|date=15 July 2012|network=Gulli}}</ref> is a purple-pink body, purple-blue head roach with a [[Heterochromia iridum|pink right eye (originally red) and yellow left eye]], and the oldest brother. Even though he's the smallest roach in the group, most of the time he's the most intelligent, always being the brain in the plans, but is sometimes forced to go solo, because his brothers often think that his plans are stupid. He loves money, but his efforts always fall short, usually ending with him getting swatted or beaten up. He is named after lead singer [[Joey Ramone]].\n** Marky is a suave heartbreaking, silvery-grey body, green head roach with pink eyes (originally red, but returned in the ending of the episode \"Teleportation\" where he is stuck in the ice cubes); he is the tallest and middle brother of the three roaches and often doesn't really care about what the two others are doing. While he originally used to love causing mischief just like his brothers, he has grown to be more laid-back in later episodes, though he still enjoys hanging out with Joey and Dee Dee and causing general mayhem like he has always done. His hobbies are dating puppets and reading books. He also has bad breath, as revealed in the season 1 and season 6 episode \"It's A Small World\". He is named after drummer [[Marky Ramone]].\n** Dee Dee is the ever-hungry cockroach and youngest of the three. He has a blue body, orange head and green eyes. His appetite sometimes reaches insane proportions, often resulting in the consumption of larger animals or other things that would otherwise be inedible (such as [[hyena]]s in one case and, due to the effects of a poisonous mushroom in another case, an insect. Other instances include the fish on the wallpaper \"Oggy's Clone\",\" and a [[clownfish]] in \"Scuba Diving\"). He is known to like opera. Sometimes it is shown that his feet are so foul-smelling, the juice they produce is toxic and melt objects, as shown in \"Caught in a Trap\". He is named after bassist [[Dee Dee Ramone]]\n* Jack is Oggy's cousin, He is a cat who has an olive green body, yellow eyes, pale Salmon pink tummy and white feet, in the show.He first appears in \"Bitter Chocolate\". He is like the complete opposite of Oggy, as he is more short-tempered, violent and arrogant than him \u2013 a perfect target for the roaches to annoy. He often finds himself building huge machinery, such as roach-catching contraptions, most of the time resulting in them backfiring, making him less lucky than Oggy in most situations. He is also very interested in chemistry (that is, the more explosive parts of it). Jack often sleeps over at Oggy's house. At times, he bullies Oggy. Jack seems to be the strongest character in the show. He likes to show off, challenge the roaches and date girls \u2013 mainly Oggy's sister Monica. He is sometimes seen trying to propose to Monica, but the cockroaches' pranks always make him stop short. In one episode, they seem to have a baby together and ask Oggy to babysit their child. Jack also has a morbid fear of heights, as shown in several episodes like the season 4 episode \"The Lighthouse Keeper\". However, in the season 1 episode \"The Rise & The Fall\" Oggy has a fear of heights instead of Jack.\n\n===Recurring===\n* Bob is a fierce brown [[bulldog]] and Oggy's neighbour,introduced in \"Oggy and the Magic Flute\". He has severe anger management issues.  A running gag in the show has Oggy or Jack doing something that accidentally crushes Bob or shaves his fur or destroys his house, with Bob then pummeling Oggy or Jack off-screen. He does not always pummel Oggy, as seen in a few episodes. He has some sort of friendship with them, as notably seen in ''Olivia'' and ''Back to the Past!''. He is known to like boxing.\n* Olivia is a white cat (also mainly wearing a yellow bow on her head), who is Oggy's new neighbour and new love interest introduced in \"Olivia\". She loves nature, even Oggy's main enemies, the cockroaches, leading to Oggy acting nice to them every time she's around. She is aware of their mischief, so she does stop them when they are around by using some aggressive methods, from her anger to even an painful-looking fly swatter. She always breaks down when someone hurts any part of nature. She also cares a lot about her looks, as seen in the episode \"Olivia's Pimple\", where when she saw a pimple on her face, she refused to leave her house. In the season 4 finale episode \"Oggy Is Getting Married (Featuring Olivia)\", as the episode title implies, Olivia and Oggy get married after a trip to [[Venice, Italy|Venice]], [[Italy]].\n* Oggy's grandma is a very rarely seen character only appearing in three episodes; \"Granny's Day\" in season 1 and \"Oggy's Grandma\" in season 3, where she appears to be very strict with Oggy's mannerisms and in \"Deep Trouble\" beside Monica, as they support Oggy and Jack. In the episodes Granny's Day and Oggy's Grandma, she attacks the cockroaches, and is actually attacked by them in Oggy's Grandma, one time being her head flattened by the lid of Oggy's toilet. She also gets frequent, short lasting bursts of energy from coffee, which aids her in defeating the cockroaches. In Granny's Day, she captures Joey and Marky, but feels sympathy for them, when Dee Dee cries on a picture of them with Joey and Marky crossed out. She is the least seen member of Oggy's family except for Oggy's parents, who were seen in a picture in \"Oggy's Grandma\". Oggy's grandma is the only female character to appear on the show to intentionally want to kill/defeat the cockroaches.\n* Monica is Oggy's twin sister and Jack's love-interest,first seen in 'Love and Kisses\". In one episode \"Don't Rock The Cradle\", they seem to have a child together. She visits Oggy's house every now and then. She is well known for being very active and likes to take on physical challenges such as [[sky diving]] and [[bungee jumping]]. She's always seen skating around on her [[inline skates]]. Out of all the main characters, she has the least number of appearances; even fewer than Bob. Monica has rarely appeared onscreen with the cockroaches or Bob (until her cameo only with Bob at the end of the 4th-season finale episode \"Oggy is Getting Married! (Featuring Olivia)\"). In the show's Hindi dubbed version, Monica is instead introduced as Oggy's childhood friend, which might be a glitch. After Season 2, she's only appeared in two other episodes, them being \"Deep Trouble\". In a Season 3 episode, she's instead seen wearing a magenta skirt and shoes instead of her rollerskates. This also marks her first appearance without them since her latest appearance in the season 2 episode \"Don't Rock The Cradle\". This also marks her first appearance without her baby in a later episode who, as mentioned before, also originated from that episode. The second and latest appearance after season 2 was the season 4 finale \"Oggy Is Getting Married (Featuring Olivia)\", where she makes a brief appearance at Oggy and Olivia's wedding as she sits next to Bob. It is unknown, but it is easier to assume she split up with Jack, as their child has never been seen again, that they've never been seen together or have been talking since season 2 and that during that same episode, Jack is staring/ogling at his new partner. She soon became friends with Olivia as in episode of Season 7, \"Sharing Oggy\".\n* Lady K is a light yellow female cockroach introduced in the season 4 episode \"Lady K\", and the roaches' new love interest (mainly Joey). She's the cockroach that lives in Olivia's house, by which Olivia is not aware of. She hates Olivia. She use the cockroaches as her pawns to get what she wants or to get her job done.\n* Bobette is the daughter of Bob who is introduced in Season 5. She is Jack's love interest, as seen in the episodes, \" Marky's Tournament\", and \"Jackromeo and Bobette\". She is seen in the episode, \"Emperor for a Day\" as Napoleon's love interest.\n\n==Production==\nAfter a four-year gap in production, Season 5 is planned for release in late 2017 with two more seasons coming later.<ref>{{cite news|title=Xilam makes debut appearance at BLE 2016|url=http://www.xilam.com/xilamwp/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Xilam-makes-debut-appearance-at-BLE-2016-FINAL-V5-23.08.pdf|accessdate=14 September 2016|date=23 August 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Xilam steers international growth with debut at BLE 2016 and PR agency appointment|url=http://www.xilam.com/xilamwp/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/340-Xilam-steers-international-growth-at-BLE-and-appoints-PR-experts-091....pdf|accessdate=14 September 2016|date=13 September 2016}}</ref> Season 6 episodes have begun airing on K2<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.k2tv.it/programmi/oggy-forever/|title=Oggy Forever|language=Italian|accessdate=8 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170628014934/http://www.k2tv.it/programmi/oggy-forever/|archive-date=28 June 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> while Season 5 will be previewed on Gulli.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.leblogtvnews.com/2017/06/saison-5-inedite-d-oggy-et-les-cafards-avant-premiere-le-30-juin-sur-gulli.html|title=Saison 5 in\u00e9dite d'Oggy et les cafards : avant-premi\u00e8re le 30 juin sur Gulli.|language=French|accessdate=8 June 2017|date=6 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Broadcast==\n{{more citations needed|date=January 2012}}\n''Oggy and the Cockroaches'' originates in France, where it aired on networks [[France 3]], [[Canal+]], [[Gulli]] and [[Canal J]].\n\n* In the United States, ''Oggy and the Cockroaches'' initially aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company]]'s [[Fox Kids]] block on September 12, 1998, six days after the original French airdate.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oltX9DmpLX8&t=11s</ref> It was soon moved to then-sister channel [[Freeform (TV channel)|Fox Family Channel]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kidscreen.com/2016/04/04/oggy-gets-exclusive-broadcasting-deal-with-lagardere/|title=Oggy gets exclusive broadcasting deal with Lagard\u00e8re|publisher=}}</ref> in 1999.

As of 2019, only BRT and Cartoon Network Asia are broadcasting the show, although they recently didn't air any new seasons due to Q.net owning Cartoon Network's Vietnam feed, forcing some shows to not air in Vietnam.\n\n==Adaptations==\n\n===Album===\nAn album, {{lang|fr|Oggy et les Cafards : Le Show du Chat}}, was released in France<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://archives-lepost.huffingtonpost.fr/article/2010/12/29/2354353_oggy-et-ses-cafards-le-dessin-anime-culte-enfin-en-cd-et-dvd.html |title=Oggy et ses cafards, le dessin anim\u00e9 culte enfin en cd et dvd ! |publisher={{Interlanguage link multi|Le Post|fr|3=Le Post|vertical-align=sup}} |author=Jeansanteuil |date=29 December 2010 |accessdate=30 November 2012 |language=French|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108141354/http://archives-lepost.huffingtonpost.fr/article/2010/12/29/2354353_oggy-et-ses-cafards-le-dessin-anime-culte-enfin-en-cd-et-dvd.html|archivedate=8 November 2012 }}</ref> on CD and for digital download on 6 September 2010.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.feminactu.com/index.php?post/2010/07/15/NOUVEAU-EN-DVD-ET-CD-%3A-Oggy-et-les-cafards-! |title=Nouveau en DVD et CD : Oggy et les cafards ! |publisher={{lang|fr|F\u00e9min Actu}} |author= |date=15 July 2010 |accessdate=30 November 2012|language=French}}</ref>\n\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed = yes\n| headline = 2010 : {{lang|fr|Oggy et les Cafards : Le Show du Chat}} <small>(Sony Music Entertainment)</small>\n| all_writing = \n| all_lyrics = \n| all_music = \n| title1 = {{lang|fr|G\u00e9n\u00e9rique Oggy et les Cafards}}\n| length1 = 0:39\n| title2 = {{lang|fr|Gaga des Gags d'Oggy}}\n| length2 = 2:48\n| title3 = {{lang|fr|Interlude \u00ab Le R\u00e9veil d'Oggy \u00bb}}\n| length3 = 0:19\n| title4 = {{lang|fr|Matez le Matou}}\n| length4 = 2:19\n| title5 = {{lang|fr|Interlude \u00ab Un Chat Bien Bott\u00e9 \u00bb}}\n| length5 = 0:21\n| title6 = [[The Love Cats (song)|Love Cats]]\n| length6 = 3:20\n| title7 = {{lang|fr|Interlude \u00ab Jack, un Ami qui vous Veut du Bien \u00bb}}\n| length7 = 0:22\n| title8 = {{lang|fr|Jack le Pote}}\n| length8 = 2:11\n| title9 = {{lang|fr|Interlude \u00ab Cafard-na\u00fcm \u00bb}}\n| length9 = 0:19\n| title10 = Oggy Rossini\n| length10 = 3:45\n| title11 = {{lang|fr|Interlude \u00ab Le Chat Volant \u00bb}}\n| length11 = 0:20\n| title12 = {{lang|fr|Dans l'\u0152il du Chat}}\n| length12 = 4:58\n| title13 = Interlude \u00ab Cat's Woman \u00bb\n| length13 = 0:20\n| title14 = Pussycat\n| length14 = 3:31\n| title15 = Interlude \u00ab Blues Cat \u00bb\n| length15 = 0:24\n| title16 = {{lang|fr|Oggy le Chat Chou}}\n| length16 = 1:53\n| title17 = {{lang|fr|Interlude \u00ab Cafards \u00e0 la Playa \u00bb}}\n| length17 = 0:52\n| title18 = {{lang|fr|Le Ragga d'Oggy}}\n| length18 = 2:54\n| title19 = {{lang|fr|G\u00e9n\u00e9rique Oggy et les Cafards}}\n| length19 = 0:42\n| title20 = Oggy Never Falls in Love (Bonus in dematerialised version)\n| length20 = 3:36\n}}\n\n===CD drama===\nA [[CD drama]], {{lang|fr|Oggy et les Cafards Volume 1}}, was released in France on CD and for digital download in October 2012.

The series continued to air on Nickelodeon in that timeslot until the season's episodes were exhausted, and it aired on sister network Nicktoons until 1 May 2015, likely solely for contractual purposes due to Nickelodeon's worldwide deal for the series which requires an airing on its American networks. For future airings of the episode worldwide, and on the official Oggy channel on YouTube, the poster image was replaced with a neutral beach scene.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[List of French animated television series]]\n* [[List of French television series]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://oggy.com/ Official website]\n* [http://www.xilam.com/portfolio/oggy-and-the-cockroaches/?lang=en Website of the producer Xilam] {{in lang|en}}\n* {{IMDb title|0213363|Oggy and the Cockroaches}}\n* {{bcdb|Other_Studios/X/Xilam_Animation/Oggy_Et_Les_Cafards/|Oggy and the Cockroaches}}\n* [https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCNEKMkg_DG8eAyR1BNWsSvw Official Youtube Channel]\n\n{{Cockroach}}\n{{Xilam}}\n{{Fox Kids}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Oggy And The Cockroaches}}\n[[Category:1990s French animated television series]]\n[[Category:1998 French television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2000s French animated television series]]\n[[Category:2010s French animated television series]]\n[[Category:Canal+ original programming]]\n[[Category:Fox Kids original programming]]\n[[Category:YTV shows]]\n[[Category:French-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Fictional rivalries]]\n[[Category:French animated television programs featuring anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:French children's animated action television series]]\n[[Category:French children's animated adventure television series]]\n[[Category:French children's animated comedy television series]]\n[[Category:Television programs adapted into films]]\n[[Category:Animated television series about cats]]\n[[Category:Animated television series about insects]]\n[[Category:Television series revived after cancellation]]\n[[Category:Xilam]]\n[[Category:Television series without speech]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|French animated comedy series}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2018}}\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name                = Oggy and the Cockroaches<br> <small> Oggy et les Cafards</small>\n| image                    = Oggy and the Cockroaches tittle.jpg\n| caption                  = Oggy (left) with Dee Dee, Marky, and Joey\n| genre                    = [[Comedy]]<!--Genres must be sourced-->\n| creator                  = [[Jean-Yves Raimbaud]]\n| developer                = [[Marc du Pontavice]]\n| director                 = [[Olivier Jean-Marie]]<br>Jean-Christophe Dessaint\n| country                  = [[France]]\n| language                 = No dialogue (text in English or French)\n| music                    = Herv\u00e9 Lavandier <small>(seasons 1\u20132)</small><br />[[Hugues Le Bars]] (seasons 1\u20134)<br />Vincent Artaud (season 5\u20137)\n| num_seasons              = 7 <!--This value to be incremented once an episode from a new season airs-->\n| num_episodes             = 501 <!--This value to be incremented as new episodes air, not before.-->\n| list_episodes            = List of Oggy and the Cockroaches episodes\n| executive_producer       = [[Marc du Pontavice]]\n| producer                 = [[Marc du Pontavice]]\n| editor                   = Laure Charossuett<br>Lou Bouniol<br>Patrick Ducruet\n| runtime                  = 7 minutes\n| company                  = [[Gaumont Film Company|Gaumont Multimedia]] (seasons 1-2)<br>[[Xilam Animation]] (season 3 onwards)\n| distributor              = <!-- Please provide sourced prose in article body before adding to infobox -->\n| network                  = [[France 3]] (season 1-2)<br>[[Canal+ Family]] (season 3-4)<br>[[Gulli]] (season 1-onwards) <!--Parameter is for original broadcast network only.

The show revolves around the titular characters: the cats Oggy, Jack and the cockroaches Joey, Marky, and Dee Dee. When the show started airing in 1998, it was successful in France and was eventually broadcast worldwide.\n\n==Synopsis==\nOggy, an [[anthropomorphic]] cat, would prefer to spend his days watching television and eating, but is continuously pestered by three roaches, Joey, Dee Dee and Marky (all named after members of the [[punk rock]] band [[Ramones]]). The Cockroaches' slapstick mischief ranges from plundering Oggy's refrigerator to hijacking the train he just boarded. There are two additional main characters: Oggy's cousin Jack, who is more violent and short-tempered than him and is also annoyed by the Cockroaches; and Bob, a short-tempered bulldog who is Oggy's neighbor.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of Oggy and the Cockroaches episodes}}\n{{section#h|Series overview|page=List of Oggy and the Cockroaches episodes}}\n\n==Characters==\n===Main===\n* Oggy is a cat with a light blue body, green eyes, grey tummy and white feet. Oggy usually spends his time either watching TV or doing housework \u2014 when not chasing the cockroaches. Despite the constant mayhem caused by the cockroaches, Oggy has developed a sort of [[love\u2013hate relationship]] with them, having lived with them for a long time. In the episode \"The Ghost Hunter\", Oggy kills the cockroaches but is terrorized by the spirits. Whenever he finds himself alone in his house, he will eventually begin to miss the cockroaches along with their pranks (as seen in the episode \"Priceless Roaches\" and \"So Lonely\") followed by nothing interesting happening in his life. Oggy's house appears bigger on the inside, mainly featured in the roller coaster-like staircase scenes. According to executive producer [[Marc du Pontavice]] and [[France Info]], the character of Oggy was named after punk rock musician [[Iggy Pop]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.commeaucinema.com/interviews/oggy-et-les-cafards-le-film-animation-comedie,289933|title=Interview with Marc du Pontavice|accessdate=14 January 2014|language=French}}</ref> and the rock album [[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.franceinfo.fr/emission/cartoon-story/2014-ete/oggy-et-les-cafards-08-06-2014-09-55|title=Article on Oggy and the Cockroaches|date=29 July 2014|accessdate=10 August 2014|language=French}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ladepeche.fr/article/2014/09/18/1954159-oggy-superstar-made-in-france.html|title=La D\u00e9p\u00eache interview|accessdate=19 September 2014|language=French}}</ref> In early episodes, Oggy, like his   [[Tom Cat|Tom and Jerry counterpart]] was the main punching bag in the series. However, in more recent episodes, Oggy has been portrayed as heroic, often triumphing over the cockroaches despite the beatings he takes from them and Bob. Notable other accomplishments include winning the Formula 1, placing first in a marathon, and ultimately winning over his girlfriend Olivia.\n*The Cockroaches are three brothers who antagonize other characters, mainly Oggy and Jack. The cockroaches love pranking them so much, that if the cats were to leave, they would miss them (as seen in the episode \"Moving Out\"). It is also implied that the roaches are named after members of the rock band, [[The Ramones]].\n** Joey (born 15 June 1991)<ref>{{cite episode|season=4|title=Let's Party, Guys!|series=Oggy and the Cockroaches|number=201|credits=Olivier Jean-Marie (director, writer), Fred Mintoff (storyboard)|date=15 July 2012|network=Gulli}}</ref> is a purple-pink body, purple-blue head roach with a [[Heterochromia iridum|pink right eye (originally red) and yellow left eye]], and the oldest brother. Even though he's the smallest roach in the group, most of the time he's the most intelligent, always being the brain in the plans, but is sometimes forced to go solo, because his brothers often think that his plans are stupid. He loves money, but his efforts always fall short, usually ending with him getting swatted or beaten up. He is named after lead singer [[Joey Ramone]].\n** Marky is a suave heartbreaking, silvery-grey body, green head roach with pink eyes (originally red, but returned in the ending of the episode \"Teleportation\" where he is stuck in the ice cubes); he is the tallest and middle brother of the three roaches and often doesn't really care about what the two others are doing. While he originally used to love causing mischief just like his brothers, he has grown to be more laid-back in later episodes, though he still enjoys hanging out with Joey and Dee Dee and causing general mayhem like he has always done. His hobbies are dating puppets and reading books. He also has bad breath, as revealed in the season 1 and season 6 episode \"It's A Small World\". He is named after drummer [[Marky Ramone]].\n** Dee Dee is the ever-hungry cockroach and youngest of the three. He has a blue body, orange head and green eyes. His appetite sometimes reaches insane proportions, often resulting in the consumption of larger animals or other things that would otherwise be inedible (such as [[hyena]]s in one case and, due to the effects of a poisonous mushroom in another case, an insect. Other instances include the fish on the wallpaper \"Oggy's Clone\",\" and a [[clownfish]] in \"Scuba Diving\"). He is known to like opera. Sometimes it is shown that his feet are so foul-smelling, the juice they produce is toxic and melt objects, as shown in \"Caught in a Trap\". He is named after bassist [[Dee Dee Ramone]]\n* Jack is Oggy's cousin, He is a cat who has an olive green body, yellow eyes, pale Salmon pink tummy and white feet, in the show. He is like the complete opposite of Oggy, as he is more short-tempered, violent and arrogant than him \u2013 a perfect target for the roaches to annoy. He often finds himself building huge machinery, such as roach-catching contraptions, most of the time resulting in them backfiring, making him less lucky than Oggy in most situations. He is also very interested in chemistry (that is, the more explosive parts of it). Jack often sleeps over at Oggy's house. At times, he bullies Oggy. Jack seems to be the strongest character in the show. He likes to show off, challenge the roaches and date girls \u2013 mainly Oggy's sister Monica. He is sometimes seen trying to propose to Monica, but the cockroaches' pranks always make him stop short. In one episode, they seem to have a baby together and ask Oggy to babysit their child. Jack also has a morbid fear of heights, as shown in several episodes like the season 4 episode \"The Lighthouse Keeper\". However, in the season 1 episode \"The Rise & The Fall\" Oggy has a fear of heights instead of Jack.\n\n===Recurring===\n* Bob is a fierce brown [[bulldog]] and Oggy's neighbour. He has severe anger management issues.  A running gag in the show has Oggy or Jack doing something that accidentally crushes Bob or shaves his fur or destroys his house, with Bob then pummeling Oggy or Jack off-screen. He does not always pummel Oggy, as seen in a few episodes. He has some sort of friendship with them, as notably seen in ''Olivia'' and ''Back to the Past!''. He is known to like boxing.\n* Olivia is a white cat (also mainly wearing a yellow bow on her head), who is Oggy's new neighbour and new love interest introduced in season 4. She loves nature, even Oggy's main enemies, the cockroaches, leading to Oggy acting nice to them every time she's around. She is aware of their mischief, so she does stop them when they are around by using some aggressive methods, from her anger to even an painful-looking fly swatter. She always breaks down when someone hurts any part of nature. She also cares a lot about her looks, as seen in the episode \"Olivia's Pimple\", where when she saw a pimple on her face, she refused to leave her house. In the season 4 finale episode \"Oggy Is Getting Married (Featuring Olivia)\", as the episode title implies, Olivia and Oggy get married after a trip to [[Venice, Italy|Venice]], [[Italy]].\n* Oggy's grandma is a very rarely seen character only appearing in three episodes; \"Granny's Day\" in season 1 and \"Oggy's Grandma\" in season 3, where she appears to be very strict with Oggy's mannerisms and in \"Deep Trouble\" beside Monica, as they support Oggy and Jack. In the episodes Granny's Day and Oggy's Grandma, she attacks the cockroaches, and is actually attacked by them in Oggy's Grandma, one time being her head flattened by the lid of Oggy's toilet. She also gets frequent, short lasting bursts of energy from coffee, which aids her in defeating the cockroaches. In Granny's Day, she captures Joey and Marky, but feels sympathy for them, when Dee Dee cries on a picture of them with Joey and Marky crossed out. She is the least seen member of Oggy's family except for Oggy's parents, who were seen in a picture in \"Oggy's Grandma\". Oggy's grandma is the only female character to appear on the show to intentionally want to kill/defeat the cockroaches.\n* Monica is Oggy's twin sister and Jack's love-interest. In one episode \"Don't Rock The Cradle\", they seem to have a child together. She visits Oggy's house every now and then. She is well known for being very active and likes to take on physical challenges such as [[sky diving]] and [[bungee jumping]]. She's always seen skating around on her [[inline skates]]. Out of all the main characters, she has the least number of appearances; even fewer than Bob. Monica has rarely appeared onscreen with the cockroaches or Bob (until her cameo only with Bob at the end of the 4th-season finale episode \"Oggy is Getting Married! (Featuring Olivia)\"). In the show's Hindi dubbed version, Monica is instead introduced as Oggy's childhood friend, which might be a glitch. After Season 2, she's only appeared in two other episodes, them being \"Deep Trouble\". In a Season 3 episode, she's instead seen wearing a magenta skirt and shoes instead of her rollerskates. This also marks her first appearance without them since her latest appearance in the season 2 episode \"Don't Rock The Cradle\". This also marks her first appearance without her baby in a later episode who, as mentioned before, also originated from that episode. The second and latest appearance after season 2 was the season 4 finale \"Oggy Is Getting Married (Featuring Olivia)\", where she makes a brief appearance at Oggy and Olivia's wedding as she sits next to Bob. It is unknown, but it is easier to assume she split up with Jack, as their child has never been seen again, that they've never been seen together or have been talking since season 2 and that during that same episode, Jack is staring/ogling at his new partner. She soon became friends with Olivia as in episode of Season 7, \"Sharing Oggy\".\n* Lady K is a light yellow female cockroach introduced in the season 4 episode \"Lady K\", and the roaches' new love interest (mainly Joey). She's the cockroach that lives in Olivia's house, by which Olivia is not aware of. She hates Olivia. She use the cockroaches as her pawns to get what she wants or to get her job done.\n* Bobette is the daughter of Bob who is introduced in Season 5. She is Jack's love interest, as seen in the episodes, \" Marky's Tournament\", and \"Jackromeo and Bobette\". She is seen in the episode, \"Emperor for a Day\" as Napoleon's love interest.\n\n==Production==\nAfter a four-year gap in production, Season 5 is planned for release in late 2017 with two more seasons coming later.<ref>{{cite news|title=Xilam makes debut appearance at BLE 2016|url=http://www.xilam.com/xilamwp/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Xilam-makes-debut-appearance-at-BLE-2016-FINAL-V5-23.08.pdf|accessdate=14 September 2016|date=23 August 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Xilam steers international growth with debut at BLE 2016 and PR agency appointment|url=http://www.xilam.com/xilamwp/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/340-Xilam-steers-international-growth-at-BLE-and-appoints-PR-experts-091....pdf|accessdate=14 September 2016|date=13 September 2016}}</ref> Season 6 episodes have begun airing on K2<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.k2tv.it/programmi/oggy-forever/|title=Oggy Forever|language=Italian|accessdate=8 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170628014934/http://www.k2tv.it/programmi/oggy-forever/|archive-date=28 June 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> while Season 5 will be previewed on Gulli.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.leblogtvnews.com/2017/06/saison-5-inedite-d-oggy-et-les-cafards-avant-premiere-le-30-juin-sur-gulli.html|title=Saison 5 in\u00e9dite d'Oggy et les cafards : avant-premi\u00e8re le 30 juin sur Gulli.|language=French|accessdate=8 June 2017|date=6 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Broadcast==\n{{more citations needed|date=January 2012}}\n''Oggy and the Cockroaches'' originates in France, where it aired on networks [[France 3]], [[Canal+]], [[Gulli]] and [[Canal J]].\n\n* In the United States, ''Oggy and the Cockroaches'' initially aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company]]'s [[Fox Kids]] block on September 12, 1998, six days after the original French airdate.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oltX9DmpLX8&t=11s</ref> It was soon moved to then-sister channel [[Freeform (TV channel)|Fox Family Channel]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kidscreen.com/2016/04/04/oggy-gets-exclusive-broadcasting-deal-with-lagardere/|title=Oggy gets exclusive broadcasting deal with Lagard\u00e8re|publisher=}}</ref> in 1999.

As of 2019, only BRT and Cartoon Network Asia are broadcasting the show, although they recently didn't air any new seasons due to Q.net owning Cartoon Network's Vietnam feed, forcing some shows to not air in Vietnam.\n\n==Adaptations==\n\n===Album===\nAn album, {{lang|fr|Oggy et les Cafards : Le Show du Chat}}, was released in France<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://archives-lepost.huffingtonpost.fr/article/2010/12/29/2354353_oggy-et-ses-cafards-le-dessin-anime-culte-enfin-en-cd-et-dvd.html |title=Oggy et ses cafards, le dessin anim\u00e9 culte enfin en cd et dvd ! |publisher={{Interlanguage link multi|Le Post|fr|3=Le Post|vertical-align=sup}} |author=Jeansanteuil |date=29 December 2010 |accessdate=30 November 2012 |language=French|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108141354/http://archives-lepost.huffingtonpost.fr/article/2010/12/29/2354353_oggy-et-ses-cafards-le-dessin-anime-culte-enfin-en-cd-et-dvd.html|archivedate=8 November 2012 }}</ref> on CD and for digital download on 6 September 2010.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.feminactu.com/index.php?post/2010/07/15/NOUVEAU-EN-DVD-ET-CD-%3A-Oggy-et-les-cafards-! |title=Nouveau en DVD et CD : Oggy et les cafards ! |publisher={{lang|fr|F\u00e9min Actu}} |author= |date=15 July 2010 |accessdate=30 November 2012|language=French}}</ref>\n\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed = yes\n| headline = 2010 : {{lang|fr|Oggy et les Cafards : Le Show du Chat}} <small>(Sony Music Entertainment)</small>\n| all_writing = \n| all_lyrics = \n| all_music = \n| title1 = {{lang|fr|G\u00e9n\u00e9rique Oggy et les Cafards}}\n| length1 = 0:39\n| title2 = {{lang|fr|Gaga des Gags d'Oggy}}\n| length2 = 2:48\n| title3 = {{lang|fr|Interlude \u00ab Le R\u00e9veil d'Oggy \u00bb}}\n| length3 = 0:19\n| title4 = {{lang|fr|Matez le Matou}}\n| length4 = 2:19\n| title5 = {{lang|fr|Interlude \u00ab Un Chat Bien Bott\u00e9 \u00bb}}\n| length5 = 0:21\n| title6 = [[The Love Cats (song)|Love Cats]]\n| length6 = 3:20\n| title7 = {{lang|fr|Interlude \u00ab Jack, un Ami qui vous Veut du Bien \u00bb}}\n| length7 = 0:22\n| title8 = {{lang|fr|Jack le Pote}}\n| length8 = 2:11\n| title9 = {{lang|fr|Interlude \u00ab Cafard-na\u00fcm \u00bb}}\n| length9 = 0:19\n| title10 = Oggy Rossini\n| length10 = 3:45\n| title11 = {{lang|fr|Interlude \u00ab Le Chat Volant \u00bb}}\n| length11 = 0:20\n| title12 = {{lang|fr|Dans l'\u0152il du Chat}}\n| length12 = 4:58\n| title13 = Interlude \u00ab Cat's Woman \u00bb\n| length13 = 0:20\n| title14 = Pussycat\n| length14 = 3:31\n| title15 = Interlude \u00ab Blues Cat \u00bb\n| length15 = 0:24\n| title16 = {{lang|fr|Oggy le Chat Chou}}\n| length16 = 1:53\n| title17 = {{lang|fr|Interlude \u00ab Cafards \u00e0 la Playa \u00bb}}\n| length17 = 0:52\n| title18 = {{lang|fr|Le Ragga d'Oggy}}\n| length18 = 2:54\n| title19 = {{lang|fr|G\u00e9n\u00e9rique Oggy et les Cafards}}\n| length19 = 0:42\n| title20 = Oggy Never Falls in Love (Bonus in dematerialised version)\n| length20 = 3:36\n}}\n\n===CD drama===\nA [[CD drama]], {{lang|fr|Oggy et les Cafards Volume 1}}, was released in France on CD and for digital download in October 2012.

The series continued to air on Nickelodeon in that timeslot until the season's episodes were exhausted, and it aired on sister network Nicktoons until 1 May 2015, likely solely for contractual purposes due to Nickelodeon's worldwide deal for the series which requires an airing on its American networks. For future airings of the episode worldwide, and on the official Oggy channel on YouTube, the poster image was replaced with a neutral beach scene.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[List of French animated television series]]\n* [[List of French television series]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://oggy.com/ Official website]\n* [http://www.xilam.com/portfolio/oggy-and-the-cockroaches/?lang=en Website of the producer Xilam] {{in lang|en}}\n* {{IMDb title|0213363|Oggy and the Cockroaches}}\n* {{bcdb|Other_Studios/X/Xilam_Animation/Oggy_Et_Les_Cafards/|Oggy and the Cockroaches}}\n* [https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCNEKMkg_DG8eAyR1BNWsSvw Official Youtube Channel]\n\n{{Cockroach}}\n{{Xilam}}\n{{Fox Kids}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Oggy And The Cockroaches}}\n[[Category:1990s French animated television series]]\n[[Category:1998 French television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2000s French animated television series]]\n[[Category:2010s French animated television series]]\n[[Category:Canal+ original programming]]\n[[Category:Fox Kids original programming]]\n[[Category:YTV shows]]\n[[Category:French-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Fictional rivalries]]\n[[Category:French animated television programs featuring anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:French children's animated action television series]]\n[[Category:French children's animated adventure television series]]\n[[Category:French children's animated comedy television series]]\n[[Category:Television programs adapted into films]]\n[[Category:Animated television series about cats]]\n[[Category:Animated television series about insects]]\n[[Category:Television series revived after cancellation]]\n[[Category:Xilam]]\n[[Category:Television series without speech]]\n", "name_user": "171.76.118.29", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eRecurring)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oggy_and_the_Cockroaches"}
