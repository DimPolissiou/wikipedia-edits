The group officially debuted on December 26, 2003 during a [[BoA]] and [[Britney Spears]] showcase. They performed their debut single \"Hug\", which became a hit in [[South Korea]]. TVXQ have been releasing number one albums in Korea since their second studio album ''[[Rising Sun (TVXQ album)|Rising Sun]]'' (2005), which was also the album that gave the group their first Daesang (\ub300\uc0c1), or Grand Award, at the [[Mnet Asian Music Awards|Mnet KM Music Festival]]. Their fourth Korean album ''[[Mirotic]]'' (2008) was the Album of the Year at the 2008 Mnet KM Music Festival and the 2008 [[Golden Disc Awards]]. The album features the group's most well-known and best-selling single, \"Mirotic.\"\n\nIn 2005, TVXQ made their Japanese debut with the single \"[[Stay with Me Tonight (TVXQ song)|Stay with Me Tonight]],\" debuting at number 37 on the [[Oricon Singles Chart]]. They grabbed their first number one single in Japan with \"[[Purple Line (song)|Purple Line]]\" (2008). Their fourth Japanese album ''[[The Secret Code (TVXQ album)|The Secret Code]]'' spawned two platinum-selling singles \"[[D\u014dshite Kimi o Suki ni Natte Shimattandar\u014d?]]\" and [[Share the World / We Are!|Share the World]]\" (2009), a theme song for the anime ''[[One Piece]]''.\n\nTVXQ was plunged into legal turmoil when members Jaejoong, Yoochun, and Junsu filed an injunction against their agency in July 2009. This led to their much-publicized departure from the group in 2010. A year later, Changmin and Yunho returned as a duo, releasing albums in both Korean and Japanese. As a duo, TVXQ set sales records and concert attendance records in Japan, becoming the country's best-selling and highest-grossing foreign music act.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.tenasia.com/2013/06/06/interview-tvxq-member-max-changmin/|title=[INTERVIEW] TVXQ! member Max Changmin|website=10Asia}}</ref>\n\n===S.M.

He has two younger sisters, and both of his parents are teachers. When he was fourteen years old, a talent scout from [[S.M.

The group officially debuted on December 26, 2003 during a [[BoA]] and [[Britney Spears]] showcase. They performed their debut single \"Hug\", which became a hit in [[South Korea]]. TVXQ have been releasing number one albums in Korea since their second studio album ''[[Rising Sun (TVXQ album)|Rising Sun]]'' (2005), which was also the album that gave the group their first Daesang (\ub300\uc0c1), or Grand Award, at the [[Mnet Asian Music Awards|Mnet KM Music Festival]]. Their fourth Korean album ''[[Mirotic]]'' (2008) was the Album of the Year at the 2008 Mnet KM Music Festival and the 2008 [[Golden Disc Awards]]. The album features the group's most well-known and best-selling single, \"Mirotic.\"\n\nIn 2005, TVXQ made their Japanese debut with the single \"[[Stay with Me Tonight (TVXQ song)|Stay with Me Tonight]],\" debuting at number 37 on the [[Oricon Singles Chart]]. They grabbed their first number one single in Japan with \"[[Purple Line (song)|Purple Line]]\" (2008). Their fourth Japanese album ''[[The Secret Code (TVXQ album)|The Secret Code]]'' spawned two platinum-selling singles \"[[D\u014dshite Kimi o Suki ni Natte Shimattandar\u014d?]]\" and [[Share the World / We Are!|Share the World]]\" (2009), a theme song for the anime ''[[One Piece]]''.\n\nTVXQ was plunged into legal turmoil when members Jaejoong, Yoochun, and Junsu filed an injunction against their agency in July 2009. This led to their much-publicized departure from the group in 2010. A year later, Changmin and Yunho returned as a duo, releasing albums in both Korean and Japanese. As a duo, TVXQ set sales records and concert attendance records in Japan, becoming the country's best-selling and highest-grossing foreign music act.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.tenasia.com/2013/06/06/interview-tvxq-member-max-changmin/|title=[INTERVIEW] TVXQ! member Max Changmin|website=10Asia}}</ref>\n\n===S.M.

Following the sack of [[Troy]], Neoptolemus and his armies settled in Epirus where they joined with the local population. Molossus inherited the kingdom of Epirus after the death of [[Helenus]], son of [[Priam]] and [[Hecuba]] of Troy, who had married his erstwhile sister-in-law [[Andromache]] after Neoptolemus's death.  According to some historians, their first king was Phaethon, one of those who came into [[Epirus]] with [[Pelasgus]]. According to [[Plutarch]], [[Deucalion]] and [[Pyrrha]], having set up the worship of [[Zeus]] at [[Dodona]], settled there among the Molossians.<ref name=\"Pyrrhus\">Plutarch.

The Chaonians ruled Epirus at an earlier time, and afterwards the Thesprotians and Molossians controlled the region. The Thesprotians, the Chaonians, and the Molossians were the three principal clusters of Greek tribes that had emerged from Epirus and were the most powerful among all other tribes.<ref name=\"Pyrrhus\"/>\n\nThe Molossians were also renowned for their vicious hounds, which were used by shepherds to guard their flocks. This is where the canine breed [[Molossus (dog)|Molossoid]], native to Greece, received its name. [[Virgil]] tells us that in  [[ancient Greece]] the heavier Molossian dogs were often used by the [[Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] for hunting (''canis venaticus'') and to watch over the house and livestock (''canis pastoralis''). \"Never, with them on guard,\" says Virgil, \"need you fear for your stalls a midnight thief, or onslaught of wolves, or [[Iberians|Iberian]] brigands at your back.\"\n\n[[Strabo]] records that the Thesprotians, Molossians and [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonians]] referred to old men as ''pelioi'' (\u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03af) and old women as ''peliai'' (\u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03b9\u03b1\u03af) (<[[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]] ''*pel-'', \"grey\").

Following the sack of [[Troy]], Neoptolemus and his armies settled in Epirus where they joined with the local population. Molossus inherited the kingdom of Epirus after the death of [[Helenus]], son of [[Priam]] and [[Hecuba]] of Troy, who had married his erstwhile sister-in-law [[Andromache]] after Neoptolemus's death.  According to some historians, their first king was Phaethon, one of those who came into [[Epirus]] with [[Pelasgus]]. According to [[Plutarch]], [[Deucalion]] and [[Pyrrha]], having set up the worship of [[Zeus]] at [[Dodona]], settled there among the Molossians.<ref name=\"Pyrrhus\">Plutarch.

The Chaonians ruled Epirus at an earlier time, and afterwards the Thesprotians and Molossians controlled the region. The Thesprotians, the Chaonians, and the Molossians were the three principal clusters of Greek tribes that had emerged from Epirus and were the most powerful among all other tribes.<ref name=\"Pyrrhus\"/>\n\nThe Molossians were also renowned for their vicious hounds, which were used by shepherds to guard their flocks. This is where the canine breed [[Molossus (dog)|Molossoid]], native to Greece, received its name. [[Virgil]] tells us that in  [[ancient Greece]] the heavier Molossian dogs were often used by the [[Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] for hunting (''canis venaticus'') and to watch over the house and livestock (''canis pastoralis''). \"Never, with them on guard,\" says Virgil, \"need you fear for your stalls a midnight thief, or onslaught of wolves, or [[Iberians|Iberian]] brigands at your back.\"\n\n[[Strabo]] records that the Thesprotians, Molossians and [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonians]] referred to old men as ''pelioi'' (\u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03af) and old women as ''peliai'' (\u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03b9\u03b1\u03af) (<[[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]] ''*pel-'', \"grey\").

MacArthur stated, \"''I'm not into all that is traditionally known as dispensationalism, seven dispensations, two kingdoms, two New Covenants, two ways of salvation, discontinuity between the Old Testament and the New.''\"<ref name=\"MacArthur, John\"/>\n\n==== [[Soteriology]] ====\nMacArthur was a key person in the [[Lordship salvation controversy]] in the 1980s, arguing against [[free grace theology]]. He states, \"You must receive Jesus Christ for who He is, both Lord and Savior, to be truly saved (II Peter 2:20).\"<ref>{{cite book |title=The Gospel According to Jesus |author=MacArthur, John |isbn=0-310-39491-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/gospelaccordingt00maca_0 }}</ref> Regarding [[eternal security]], he states, \"It should never be presented merely as a matter of being once saved, always saved\u2014with no regard for what you believe or do. The writer of Hebrews 12:14 states frankly that only those who continue living holy lives will enter the Lord's presence.\" MacArthur's views raised controversy within U.S. evangelicalism and were challenged in print by non-lordship dispensationalist theologians [[Charles Ryrie]] and [[Zane C. Hodges]], who argued that MacArthur was teaching a form of works-based salvation. MacArthur has denied the charge, as attested on two tapes recorded in 1989 when he was asked to reason together with the IFCA man.<ref>https://www.gty.org/library/sermons-library/90-37/ifca-meeting-62689-part-2 https://www.gty.org/library/sermons-library/90-36/ifca-meeting-62689-part-1</ref>\n\nIn December 1989, the [[Bible Broadcasting Network]] terminated MacArthur's ''Grace to You'' program. In explaining that step, BBN president Lowell Davey referred to MacArthur's teachings on the blood of Christ and \"Lordship salvation.\" Davey called these teachings \"confusing\". In a letter dated January 15, 1990, Davey cited a \"drift by Dr. MacArthur to a theological position that we could not adhere to\" and said that MacArthur's sermon series on the theology of election \"convinced us that the direction of 'Grace to You' was toward Hyper-Calvinism.\" MacArthur preaches salvation by election of God's sovereignty.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chosen from Eternity: Chosen by God--Part 1 |author=MacArthur, John |url=http://www.gty.org/Resources/Sermons/60-2}}</ref> However, the term \"Hyper-Calvinism\" is used by some to denote 5-point Calvinism or even any strong defense of Calvinism, rather than the historical \"Hyper-Calvinism\" position denies the doctrine of duty faith. This position does not seem to accurately reflect MacArthur's position in his sermons. The controversy concerning the efficacy of Christ's blood stems from MacArthur's statement that it is not the literal liquid blood of Christ that saves, but his sacrificial death on [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]], a view that he espoused in an article titled \"Not His Bleeding, but His Dying,\" published in the May 1976 issue of the ''Grace to You'' family paper distributed to his church. MacArthur himself, though, later clarified what was stated of him in the article, noting his position concerning Christ's blood and death in atonement, mentioning that the efficacy of Christ's blood is not some particular physical property of the blood itself, but the fact that He shed blood in dying, and his affirmation that Christ's blood in death was necessary to satisfy God's holy requirement for atonement.<ref>{{cite web |title=What's All the Controversy About John MacArthur and the Blood of Christ? |url=http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/articles/blood.htm |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111205235106/http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/articles/blood.htm |archivedate=December 5, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n==== Christology ====\nIn 1983, MacArthur first published his belief in the doctrine of \"[[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnational sonship]].\" In 1989, after some criticism, he defended his views in a plenary session of the annual convention of the [[Independent Fundamental Churches of America]]. In an article on MacArthur's web site ''Grace to You'' entitled \"Reexamining the Eternal Sonship of Christ,\" he retraces his views from 1983 onward, concluding, \"I want to state publicly that I have abandoned the doctrine of 'incarnational sonship.' Careful study and reflection have brought me to understand that Scripture does indeed present the relationship between God the Father and Christ the Son as an eternal Father-Son relationship. I no longer regard Christ's sonship as a role He assumed in His incarnation.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Reexamining the Eternal Sonship of Christ |author=MacArthur, John |publisher=Grace to You |url=http://www.gty.org/Resources/Articles/593}}</ref>{{original research inline |date=March 2011}}\n\n==== Cessationism ====\n[[Image:Charismatic Chaos.jpg|thumb|widthpx|''Charismatic Chaos'' - one of the books where MacArthur argues for cessationism.]]\nMacArthur is a [[cessationism|cessationist]] and is one of the most prominent voices in the church against the [[continuationism|continuationist]] beliefs of [[Pentecostalism]] and the [[Charismatic Movement]]. He has written three books in support of his position: ''The Charismatics'' (1978), ''Charismatic Chaos'' (1993), and ''Strange Fire: The Danger of Offending the Holy Spirit with Counterfeit Worship'' (2013). In October 2013, he hosted a conference called \"Strange Fire\" at his church to mark the launch of his book of the same name. The event featured a number of speakers who argued for a cessationist theology and strongly critiqued the Charismatic Movement.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Menzie|first1=Nicola|title='Strange Fire' Conference: John MacArthur Calls Out Charismatic Movement as 'Unfaithful'|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/strange-fire-conference-john-macarthur-calls-out-charismatic-movement-as-unfaithful-106849/|website=The Christian Post|publisher=The Christian Post|accessdate=June 3, 2015}}</ref> In his opening remarks, MacArthur stated, \"Watching the behavior of some Hindus who belong to the Kundalini cult. Their body movements are almost identical to that of people in the charismatic movement, the extreme behavior of pagans. This is the work of Satan, it is the work of darkness, and not to be attributed to the Holy Spirit\". And that, \"The Charismatic movement as such has made no contribution to biblical clarity, interpretation, or sound doctrine ... It detracts and confuses.\" \"It has only produced distortion, confusion, and error.\" \"Have people truly been saved in Charismatic churches? Yes. But nothing coming from that movement has been the reason they were saved.\" \"Evangelicalism has thrown its arms open and has welcomed the Trojan horse of the charismatic movement into the city of God.

However, he saw its interdenominational presence as being \"a testimony to the absence of any theology,\" and charged that \"its theology is both heterodox and heretical...everything is defined by experience..and therefore has a weak view of Scripture, that's the charismatic movement.\" He further criticized the modern Charismatic movement, stating that \"In 1967 a bunch of Jesus freak people in the beach areas of Southern California go to [[Calvary Chapel]]..and for the first time, the church, that I know of in history, the church lets the very defined subculture dictate what it will be. Out go the ties, out go the hymns, out go all the normal and formal things...and the hippie culture, you know, kids coming out of drugs, communal living, free sex, and all that kind of casual thing, and that's a charismatic church, that's a four-square church...That's where the movement becomes what we know as Calvary Chapel.\" \"The first Calvary Chapel was essentially the church saying we'll let the culture tell us what we need to be...The charismatic movement has developed...its comfortable in Roman Catholicism, its comfortable in dead denominationalism...I think its a false form of Christianity.\"<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYulTGso804/JohnMacArthur|title=John MacArthur \"What has happened after the 'Strange Fire' Conference\"|publisher=YouTube |date=August 28, 2013 |accessdate=December 5, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1991 however, MacArthur commended [[Chuck Smith (pastor)|Chuck Smith]], founder of the Calvary Chapel movement, for writing \"a straight forward critique of charismatic extremism,\" and stated that \"there are many like him who have taken their stand and I thank God for their courage and their desire to be Biblical.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=MacArthur|first=John|title=Does God Promise Health and Wealth?

Addressing the \"Strange Fire\" conference, continuationist [[Calvinist Baptist]] [[John Piper (theologian)|John Piper]] concurs that there are many abuses in the charismatic church, however he adds that \"we really need to keep in mind that every charismatic abuse has its mirror image in non-charismatic abuses...In some of these cases, the non-charismatic church is more guilty than the charismatic,\" such as, \"the absence of emotion, which is probably more deadly than the excesses.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Piper|first1=John|title=Piper Addresses Strange Fire and Charismatic Chaos|url=http://www.desiringgod.org/articles/piper-addresses-strange-fire-and-charismatic-chaos|publisher=Desiring God|accessdate=June 3, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==== Complementarianism ====\nMacArthur opposes \"male [[Chauvinism|chauvinist]] and [[Feminism|feminist]] views\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gty.org/library/blog/B100902|title=The Loving Husband: A Portrait of Christ|website=www.gty.org|access-date=April 10, 2017}}</ref> with a [[complementarian]] view on [[gender role]]s and considers that the Bible does not allow women to preach to men or exercise authority in churches.

MacArthur does not reject all forms of psychological theories and techniques, though he considers some psychology and [[psychiatry]] as contrary to the Bible.<ref>{{Citation|author=Ganz and MacArthur|title=PsychoBabble: The Failure of Modern Psychology--and the Biblical Alternative|publisher=Crossway|year=1993}}</ref>\n\nHe has argued that \"True psychology (i.e. \"the study of the soul\") can be done only by Christians, since only Christians have the resources for understanding and transforming the soul. The secular discipline of psychology is based on godless assumptions and evolutionary foundations and is capable of dealing with people only superficially and only on the temporal level... Psychology is no more a science than the atheistic evolutionary theory upon which it is based.

Does he  still go to heaven? replying MacArthur to this question in a positive way, and creating this an argument and disagreement by another attendant, the dominican, reformed Calvinist (TULIP) lead-pastor of Grace Bible Church in Santo Domingo Oriental, Willy Bayonet, who replied in the same time, and after this answer by MacArthur, that a supposed christian believer who takes his life is not a true christian. \n\nIn 2018, and After five years trying to convince MacArthur and his followers and associates, pastor Willy Bayonet was ready to publish his book in Spanish 'La Nobleza de Dios: Vivir o Morir' ('The Nobility of God: Living or Dying' for the English title of the book which is still being translated into English) against MacArthur's teaching about Suicidals going to heaven or 'In Suicide, Against MacArthurion,' as the author Willy Bayonet, nicknamed it. Pastor Bayonet's book is centered on the classic reformed book by William Gurnall, 'The Christian in complete Armour,' the Confession of faith of London of 1689, several reformed authors from past centuries as pastor Spurgeon, Martyn Lloyd Jones, among others, and a few contemporary reformed authors, who he says never preached or taught about suicide. Pastor MacArthur also holds his position in his ministry 'Grace to You, and with written notes online, about those who he states \"Commit Suicide and still go to Heaven.\" When pastor Willy Bayonet is asked about what he expects from pastor John MacArthur, his answer is that pastor MacArthur should stay silent about suicidals' status, as it' has been done before.\n\nIn 2019, at the Truth Matters Conference, where, during a word association questionnaire, the name, \"Beth Moore\" was given. Reiterating his stance on 1 Timothy 2:12, MacArthur responded by stating that [[Beth Moore]] should, \"Go home\" and that, \"There is no case that can be made Biblically for a woman preacher. Period.

I surrendered to a calling of God. It never occurs to me for a second to not fulfill it. I will follow Jesus - and Jesus alone - all the way home. And I will see His beautiful face and proclaim, Worthy is the Lamb!\" Her response caused a lengthy discussion on social media and elsewhere on the inerrancy of Scripture and whether the Bible has changed in meaning since it was first written.\n\n==Selected publications==\n{{Main|John MacArthur bibliography}}\n\n*''Twelve Extraordinary Women: God Shaped Women of the Bible, and What He Wants to Do with You by John F.

MacArthur stated, \"''I'm not into all that is traditionally known as dispensationalism, seven dispensations, two kingdoms, two New Covenants, two ways of salvation, discontinuity between the Old Testament and the New.''\"<ref name=\"MacArthur, John\"/>\n\n==== [[Soteriology]] ====\nMacArthur was a key person in the [[Lordship salvation controversy]] in the 1980s, arguing against [[free grace theology]]. He states, \"You must receive Jesus Christ for who He is, both Lord and Savior, to be truly saved (II Peter 2:20).\"<ref>{{cite book |title=The Gospel According to Jesus |author=MacArthur, John |isbn=0-310-39491-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/gospelaccordingt00maca_0 }}</ref> Regarding [[eternal security]], he states, \"It should never be presented merely as a matter of being once saved, always saved\u2014with no regard for what you believe or do. The writer of Hebrews 12:14 states frankly that only those who continue living holy lives will enter the Lord's presence.\" MacArthur's views raised controversy within U.S. evangelicalism and were challenged in print by non-lordship dispensationalist theologians [[Charles Ryrie]] and [[Zane C. Hodges]], who argued that MacArthur was teaching a form of works-based salvation. MacArthur has denied the charge, as attested on two tapes recorded in 1989 when he was asked to reason together with the IFCA man.<ref>https://www.gty.org/library/sermons-library/90-37/ifca-meeting-62689-part-2 https://www.gty.org/library/sermons-library/90-36/ifca-meeting-62689-part-1</ref>\n\nIn December 1989, the [[Bible Broadcasting Network]] terminated MacArthur's ''Grace to You'' program. In explaining that step, BBN president Lowell Davey referred to MacArthur's teachings on the blood of Christ and \"Lordship salvation.\" Davey called these teachings \"confusing\". In a letter dated January 15, 1990, Davey cited a \"drift by Dr. MacArthur to a theological position that we could not adhere to\" and said that MacArthur's sermon series on the theology of election \"convinced us that the direction of 'Grace to You' was toward Hyper-Calvinism.\" MacArthur preaches salvation by election of God's sovereignty.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chosen from Eternity: Chosen by God--Part 1 |author=MacArthur, John |url=http://www.gty.org/Resources/Sermons/60-2}}</ref> However, the term \"Hyper-Calvinism\" is used by some to denote 5-point Calvinism or even any strong defense of Calvinism, rather than the historical \"Hyper-Calvinism\" position denies the doctrine of duty faith. This position does not seem to accurately reflect MacArthur's position in his sermons. The controversy concerning the efficacy of Christ's blood stems from MacArthur's statement that it is not the literal liquid blood of Christ that saves, but his sacrificial death on [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]], a view that he espoused in an article titled \"Not His Bleeding, but His Dying,\" published in the May 1976 issue of the ''Grace to You'' family paper distributed to his church. MacArthur himself, though, later clarified what was stated of him in the article, noting his position concerning Christ's blood and death in atonement, mentioning that the efficacy of Christ's blood is not some particular physical property of the blood itself, but the fact that He shed blood in dying, and his affirmation that Christ's blood in death was necessary to satisfy God's holy requirement for atonement.<ref>{{cite web |title=What's All the Controversy About John MacArthur and the Blood of Christ? |url=http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/articles/blood.htm |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111205235106/http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/articles/blood.htm |archivedate=December 5, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n==== Christology ====\nIn 1983, MacArthur first published his belief in the doctrine of \"[[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnational sonship]].\" In 1989, after some criticism, he defended his views in a plenary session of the annual convention of the [[Independent Fundamental Churches of America]]. In an article on MacArthur's web site ''Grace to You'' entitled \"Reexamining the Eternal Sonship of Christ,\" he retraces his views from 1983 onward, concluding, \"I want to state publicly that I have abandoned the doctrine of 'incarnational sonship.' Careful study and reflection have brought me to understand that Scripture does indeed present the relationship between God the Father and Christ the Son as an eternal Father-Son relationship. I no longer regard Christ's sonship as a role He assumed in His incarnation.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Reexamining the Eternal Sonship of Christ |author=MacArthur, John |publisher=Grace to You |url=http://www.gty.org/Resources/Articles/593}}</ref>{{original research inline |date=March 2011}}\n\n==== Cessationism ====\n[[Image:Charismatic Chaos.jpg|thumb|widthpx|''Charismatic Chaos'' - one of the books where MacArthur argues for cessationism.]]\nMacArthur is a [[cessationism|cessationist]] and is one of the most prominent voices in the church against the [[continuationism|continuationist]] beliefs of [[Pentecostalism]] and the [[Charismatic Movement]]. He has written three books in support of his position: ''The Charismatics'' (1978), ''Charismatic Chaos'' (1993), and ''Strange Fire: The Danger of Offending the Holy Spirit with Counterfeit Worship'' (2013). In October 2013, he hosted a conference called \"Strange Fire\" at his church to mark the launch of his book of the same name. The event featured a number of speakers who argued for a cessationist theology and strongly critiqued the Charismatic Movement.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Menzie|first1=Nicola|title='Strange Fire' Conference: John MacArthur Calls Out Charismatic Movement as 'Unfaithful'|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/strange-fire-conference-john-macarthur-calls-out-charismatic-movement-as-unfaithful-106849/|website=The Christian Post|publisher=The Christian Post|accessdate=June 3, 2015}}</ref> In his opening remarks, MacArthur stated, \"Watching the behavior of some Hindus who belong to the Kundalini cult. Their body movements are almost identical to that of people in the charismatic movement, the extreme behavior of pagans. This is the work of Satan, it is the work of darkness, and not to be attributed to the Holy Spirit\". And that, \"The Charismatic movement as such has made no contribution to biblical clarity, interpretation, or sound doctrine ... It detracts and confuses.\" \"It has only produced distortion, confusion, and error.\" \"Have people truly been saved in Charismatic churches? Yes. But nothing coming from that movement has been the reason they were saved.\" \"Evangelicalism has thrown its arms open and has welcomed the Trojan horse of the charismatic movement into the city of God.

However, he saw its interdenominational presence as being \"a testimony to the absence of any theology,\" and charged that \"its theology is both heterodox and heretical...everything is defined by experience..and therefore has a weak view of Scripture, that's the charismatic movement.\" He further criticized the modern Charismatic movement, stating that \"In 1967 a bunch of Jesus freak people in the beach areas of Southern California go to [[Calvary Chapel]]..and for the first time, the church, that I know of in history, the church lets the very defined subculture dictate what it will be. Out go the ties, out go the hymns, out go all the normal and formal things...and the hippie culture, you know, kids coming out of drugs, communal living, free sex, and all that kind of casual thing, and that's a charismatic church, that's a four-square church...That's where the movement becomes what we know as Calvary Chapel.\" \"The first Calvary Chapel was essentially the church saying we'll let the culture tell us what we need to be...The charismatic movement has developed...its comfortable in Roman Catholicism, its comfortable in dead denominationalism...I think its a false form of Christianity.\"<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYulTGso804/JohnMacArthur|title=John MacArthur \"What has happened after the 'Strange Fire' Conference\"|publisher=YouTube |date=August 28, 2013 |accessdate=December 5, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1991 however, MacArthur commended [[Chuck Smith (pastor)|Chuck Smith]], founder of the Calvary Chapel movement, for writing \"a straight forward critique of charismatic extremism,\" and stated that \"there are many like him who have taken their stand and I thank God for their courage and their desire to be Biblical.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=MacArthur|first=John|title=Does God Promise Health and Wealth?

Addressing the \"Strange Fire\" conference, continuationist [[Calvinist Baptist]] [[John Piper (theologian)|John Piper]] concurs that there are many abuses in the charismatic church, however he adds that \"we really need to keep in mind that every charismatic abuse has its mirror image in non-charismatic abuses...In some of these cases, the non-charismatic church is more guilty than the charismatic,\" such as, \"the absence of emotion, which is probably more deadly than the excesses.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Piper|first1=John|title=Piper Addresses Strange Fire and Charismatic Chaos|url=http://www.desiringgod.org/articles/piper-addresses-strange-fire-and-charismatic-chaos|publisher=Desiring God|accessdate=June 3, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==== Complementarianism ====\nMacArthur opposes \"male [[Chauvinism|chauvinist]] and [[Feminism|feminist]] views\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gty.org/library/blog/B100902|title=The Loving Husband: A Portrait of Christ|website=www.gty.org|access-date=April 10, 2017}}</ref> with a [[complementarian]] view on [[gender role]]s and considers that the Bible does not allow women to preach to men or exercise authority in churches.

MacArthur does not reject all forms of psychological theories and techniques, though he considers some psychology and [[psychiatry]] as contrary to the Bible.<ref>{{Citation|author=Ganz and MacArthur|title=PsychoBabble: The Failure of Modern Psychology--and the Biblical Alternative|publisher=Crossway|year=1993}}</ref>\n\nHe has argued that \"True psychology (i.e. \"the study of the soul\") can be done only by Christians, since only Christians have the resources for understanding and transforming the soul. The secular discipline of psychology is based on godless assumptions and evolutionary foundations and is capable of dealing with people only superficially and only on the temporal level... Psychology is no more a science than the atheistic evolutionary theory upon which it is based. Like theistic evolution, [[Christian psychology]] is an attempt to harmonize two inherently contradictory systems of thought.

Does he  still go to heaven? replying MacArthur to this question in a positive way, and creating this an argument and disagreement by another attendant, the dominican, reformed Calvinist (TULIP) lead-pastor of Grace Bible Church in Santo Domingo Oriental, Willy Bayonet, who replied in the same time, and after this answer by MacArthur, that a supposed christian believer who takes his life is not a true christian. \n\nIn 2018, and After five years trying to convince MacArthur and his followers and associates, pastor Willy Bayonet was ready to publish his book in Spanish 'La Nobleza de Dios: Vivir o Morir' ('The Nobility of God: Living or Dying' for the English title of the book which is still being translated into English) against MacArthur's teaching about Suicidals going to heaven or 'In Suicide, Against MacArthurion,' as the author Willy Bayonet, nicknamed it. Pastor Bayonet's book is centered on the classic reformed book by William Gurnall, 'The Christian in complete Armour,' the Confession of faith of London of 1689, several reformed authors from past centuries as pastor Spurgeon, Martyn Lloyd Jones, among others, and a few contemporary reformed authors, who he says never preached or taught about suicide. Pastor MacArthur also holds his position in his ministry 'Grace to You, and with written notes online, about those who he states \"Commit Suicide and still go to Heaven.\" When pastor Willy Bayonet is asked about what he expects from pastor John MacArthur, his answer is that pastor MacArthur should stay silent about suicidals' status, as it' has been done before.\n\nIn 2019, at the Truth Matters Conference, where, during a word association questionnaire, the name, \"Beth Moore\" was given. Reiterating his stance on 1 Timothy 2:12, MacArthur responded by stating that [[Beth Moore]] should, \"Go home\" and that, \"There is no case that can be made Biblically for a woman preacher. Period. Paragraph. End of Discussion.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=MacArthur |first1=John |title=Go Home Beth Moore |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeNKHqpBcgc&t=88s |website=YouTubw |accessdate=24 November 2019}}</ref> Moore responded to this stance by stating on her Twitter account, \"I did not surrender to a calling of man when I was 18 years old. I surrendered to a calling of God. It never occurs to me for a second to not fulfill it. I will follow Jesus - and Jesus alone - all the way home. And I will see His beautiful face and proclaim, Worthy is the Lamb!\" Her response caused a lengthy discussion on social media and elsewhere on the inerrancy of Scripture and whether the Bible has changed in meaning since it was first written.\n\n==Selected publications==\n{{Main|John MacArthur bibliography}}\n\n*''Twelve Extraordinary Women: God Shaped Women of the Bible, and What He Wants to Do with You by John F.

Its initial focus was on [[protein folding]] but has shifted to more biomedical problems, such as [[Alzheimer's disease]], cancer, Coronavirus disease 2019, and Ebola virus disease. The project uses the idle CPU time of personal computers owned by volunteers who have installed the software on their systems. The project was started in October 2000 by the Pande Laboratory at [[Stanford University]], under the direction of Prof. Vijay S. Pande, who led the project until 2019.<ref name=\"About FAH\"/>{{Verify source|reason=The source doesn't even mention 'cancer', 'Ebola', 'COVID-19', 'idle' resources, or 'Vijay Pande'|date=April 2020}} Folding@home is currently led by Dr. Greg Bowman of Washington University School of Medicine, a former student of Dr. Pande.<ref name=\"FAH leadership change\"/>\n\nThe project has pioneered the utilization of [[central processing unit]]s (CPUs), [[graphics processing unit]]s (GPUs), [[PlayStation&nbsp;3]]s, [[Message Passing Interface]] (used for computing on [[multi-core processor]]s), and some [[Sony Xperia]] smartphones for distributed computing and scientific research. The project uses statistical [[simulation]] methodology that is a [[paradigm shift]] from traditional computing methods.<ref name=\"10.1016/j.ymeth.2010.06.002\"/> As part of the [[client\u2013server model]] [[network architecture]], the volunteered machines each receive pieces of a simulation (work units), complete them, and return them to the project's [[database server]]s, where the units are compiled into an overall simulation. Volunteers can track their contributions on the Folding@home website, which makes volunteers' participation competitive and encourages long-term involvement.\n\nFolding@home is one of the world's fastest computing systems. With heightened interest in the project as a result of the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], the system achieved a speed of approximately 1.18 [[FLOPS|exaFLOPS]], or 2.36 x86 exaFLOPS, by April 8, 2020,<ref>{{cite web | url = https://archive.is/fISnM | title = Client Statistics by OS | author = Pande lab | publisher = Archive.is | accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref> making it the world's first [[Exascale computing|exaFLOP computing system]]. This level of performance from its large-scale computing network has allowed researchers to run [[Analysis of algorithms|computationally costly]] atomic-level simulations of protein folding thousands of times longer than formerly achieved. Since its launch on 1&nbsp;October&nbsp;2000, the Pande Lab has produced 223 [[Academic publishing|scientific research papers]] as a direct result of Folding@home.<ref name=\"papers-march-2020\">{{cite web |title=Papers & Results |url=https://foldingathome.org/papers-results/ |website=Folding@home.org |accessdate=13 March 2020}}</ref> Results from the project's simulations agree well with experiments.<ref name=\"10.1021/ja9090353\"/><ref name=\"10.1073/pnas.1003962107\"/><ref name=\"10.1038/nature01160\"/>\n\n== Background ==\n{{further|Protein folding}}\n[[File:Protein folding.png|thumb|A protein before and after folding. It starts in an unstable [[random coil]] state and finishes in its native state conformation.]]\n\n[[Protein]]s are an essential component to many biological functions and participate in virtually all processes within [[Cell (biology)|biological cell]]s. They often act as [[enzyme]]s, performing biochemical reactions including [[cell signaling]], molecular transportation, and [[Cell cycle#Regulation of eukaryotic cell cycle|cellular regulation]]. As structural elements, some proteins act as a type of [[cytoskeleton|skeleton for cells]], and as [[antibodies]], while other proteins participate in the [[immune system]]. Before a protein can take on these roles, it must fold into a functional [[Protein tertiary structure|three-dimensional structure]], a process that often occurs spontaneously and is dependent on interactions within its [[amino acid]] sequence and interactions of the amino acids with their surroundings. Protein folding is driven by the search to find the most energetically favorable conformation of the protein, i.e., its [[native state]]. Thus, understanding protein folding is critical to understanding what a protein does and how it works, and is considered a holy grail of [[computational biology]].<ref name=\"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000452\"/><ref name=\"10.1126/science.309.5731.78b\"/> Despite folding occurring within a [[macromolecular crowding|crowded cellular environment]], it typically proceeds smoothly. However, due to a protein's chemical properties or other factors, proteins may [[protein misfolding|misfold]], that is, fold down the wrong pathway and end up misshapen. Unless cellular mechanisms can destroy or refold misfolded proteins, they can subsequently [[Protein aggregation|aggregate]] and cause a variety of debilitating diseases.<ref name=\"10.1002/iub.117\"/> Laboratory experiments studying these processes can be limited in scope and atomic detail, leading scientists to use physics-based computing models that, when complementing experiments, seek to provide a more complete picture of protein folding, misfolding, and aggregation.<ref name=\"10.1016/j.abb.2007.05.014\"/><ref name=\"10.1016/j.cbpa.2008.02.011\"/>\n\nDue to the complexity of proteins' conformation or [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]] (the set of possible shapes a protein can take), and limits in computing power, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations have been severely limited in the timescales which they can study. While most proteins typically fold in the order of milliseconds,<ref name=\"10.1016/j.abb.2007.05.014\"/><ref name=\"10.1146/annurev.biophys.34.040204.144447\"/> before 2010, simulations could only reach nanosecond to microsecond timescales.<ref name=\"10.1021/ja9090353\"/> General-purpose [[supercomputer]]s have been used to simulate protein folding, but such systems are intrinsically costly and typically shared among many research groups. Further, because the computations in kinetic models occur serially, strong [[scalability|scaling]] of traditional molecular simulations to these architectures is exceptionally difficult.<ref name=\"978-1-58603-796-3\"/><ref name=\"10.1002/bip.10219\"/> Moreover, as protein folding is a [[stochastic process]] and can statistically vary over time, it is challenging computationally to use long simulations for comprehensive views of the folding process.<ref name=\"10.1016/j.sbi.2010.10.006\"/><ref name=\"10.1137/06065146X\"/>\n\n[[File:ACBP MSM from Folding@home.tiff|thumb|Folding@home uses [[Markov state model]]s, like the one diagrammed here, to model the possible shapes and folding pathways a protein can take as it condenses from its initial randomly coiled state (left) into its native 3-D structure (right).]]\nProtein folding does not occur in one step.<ref name=\"10.1002/iub.117\"/> Instead, proteins spend most of their folding time, nearly 96% in some cases,<ref name=\"10.1016/j.sbi.2011.12.001\"/> ''waiting'' in various intermediate [[protein conformation|conformational]] states, each a local [[thermodynamic free energy]] minimum in the protein's [[energy landscape]]. Through a process known as [[adaptive sampling]], these conformations are used by Folding@home as starting points for a [[set (mathematics)|set]] of simulation trajectories. As the simulations discover more conformations, the trajectories are restarted from them, and a [[Hidden Markov model|Markov state model]] (MSM) is gradually created from this cyclic process. MSMs are [[discrete-time]] [[master equation]] models which describe a biomolecule's conformational and energy landscape as a set of distinct structures and the short transitions between them. The adaptive sampling Markov state model method significantly increases the efficiency of simulation as it avoids computation inside the local energy minimum itself, and is amenable to distributed computing (including on [[GPUGRID]]) as it allows for the statistical aggregation of short, independent simulation trajectories.<ref name=\"Simulation FAQ\"/> The amount of time it takes to construct a Markov state model is inversely proportional to the number of parallel simulations run, i.e., the number of processors available. In other words, it achieves linear [[parallelization]], leading to an approximately four [[orders of magnitude]] reduction in overall serial calculation time. A completed MSM may contain tens of thousands of sample states from the protein's [[phase space]] (all the conformations a protein can take on) and the transitions between them. The model illustrates folding events and pathways (i.e., routes) and researchers can later use kinetic clustering to view a coarse-grained representation of the otherwise highly detailed model. They can use these MSMs to reveal how proteins misfold and to quantitatively compare simulations with experiments.<ref name=\"10.1016/j.ymeth.2010.06.002\"/><ref name=\"10.1016/j.sbi.2010.10.006\"/><ref name=\"10.1021/ct900620b\"/>\n\nBetween 2000 and 2010, the length of the proteins Folding@home has studied have increased by a factor of four, while its timescales for protein folding simulations have increased by six orders of magnitude.<ref name=\"typepad: how far FAH has come\"/> In 2002, Folding@home used Markov state models to complete approximately a million [[CPU]] days of simulations over the span of several months,<ref name=\"10.1038/nature01160\"/> and in 2011, MSMs parallelized another simulation that required an aggregate 10&nbsp;million CPU hours of computing.<ref name=\"10.1073/pnas.1010880108\"/> In January 2010, Folding@home used MSMs to simulate the dynamics of the slow-folding 32-[[amino acid|residue]] NTL9 protein out to 1.52&nbsp;milliseconds, a timescale consistent with experimental folding rate predictions but a thousand times longer than formerly achieved. The model consisted of many individual trajectories, each two orders of magnitude shorter, and provided an unprecedented level of detail into the protein's energy landscape.<ref name=\"10.1016/j.ymeth.2010.06.002\"/><ref name=\"10.1021/ja9090353\"/><ref name=\"10.3390/ijms11125292\"/> In 2010, Folding@home researcher Gregory Bowman was awarded the [[Thomas Kuhn#Thomas Kuhn Paradigm Shift Award|Thomas Kuhn Paradigm Shift Award]] from the [[American Chemical Society]] for the development of the [[open-source software|open-source]] MSMBuilder software and for attaining quantitative agreement between theory and experiment.<ref name=\"2010 KPS award\"/><ref name=\"MSMBuilder source\"/> For his work, Pande was awarded the 2012 Michael and Kate B\u00e1r\u00e1ny Award for Young Investigators for \"developing field-defining and field-changing computational methods to produce leading theoretical models for protein and [[RNA]] folding\",<ref name=\"Biophysical society names recipients\"/> and the 2006 Irving Sigal Young Investigator Award for his simulation results which \"have stimulated a re-examination of the meaning of both ensemble and single-molecule measurements, making Dr. Pande's efforts pioneering contributions to simulation methodology.\"<ref name=\"FAH Awards\"/>\n\n== Examples of application in biomedical research ==\nProtein misfolding can result in a [[proteopathy|variety of diseases]] including Alzheimer's disease, [[cancer]], [[Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease]], [[cystic fibrosis]], Huntington's disease, [[sickle-cell anemia]], and [[type&nbsp;II diabetes]].<ref name=\"10.1002/iub.117\"/><ref name=\"Protein Misfolding Diseases\"/><ref name=\"diseases FAQ\"/> Cellular infection by viruses such as [[HIV]] and [[influenza]] also involve folding events on [[cell membrane]]s.<ref name=\"978-0-340-66316-5\"/> Once protein misfolding is better understood, therapies can be developed that augment cells' natural ability to regulate protein folding.  Such [[therapies]] include the use of engineered molecules to alter the production of a given protein, help destroy a misfolded protein, or assist in the folding process.<ref name=\"10.1038/nature02265\"/> The combination of computational molecular modeling and experimental analysis has the possibility to fundamentally shape the future of molecular medicine and the [[drug design|rational design of therapeutics]],<ref name=\"10.1016/j.cbpa.2008.02.011\"/> such as expediting and lowering the costs of [[drug discovery]].<ref name=\"10.1093/bib/bbp023\"/> The goal of the first five years of Folding@home was to make advances in understanding folding, while the current goal is to understand misfolding and related disease, especially Alzheimer's.<ref name=\"Press FAQ\"/>\n\nThe simulations run on Folding@home are used in conjunction with laboratory experiments,<ref name=\"10.1016/j.sbi.2010.10.006\"/> but researchers can use them to study how folding ''[[in vitro]]'' differs from folding in native cellular environments. This is advantageous in studying aspects of folding, misfolding, and their relationships to disease that are difficult to observe experimentally. For example, in 2011, Folding@home simulated protein folding inside a [[ribosome|ribosomal]] exit tunnel, to help scientists better understand how natural confinement and crowding might influence the folding process.<ref name=\"forum: 7808/7809 to FAH\"/><ref name=\"10.1073/pnas.0608256104\"/> Furthermore, scientists typically employ chemical [[denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturants]] to unfold proteins from their stable native state. It is not generally known how the denaturant affects the protein's refolding, and it is difficult to experimentally determine if these denatured states contain residual structures which may influence folding behavior. In 2010, Folding@home used GPUs to simulate the unfolded states of [[Protein&nbsp;L]], and predicted its collapse rate in strong agreement with experimental results.<ref name=\"10.1021/ja908369h\"/>\n\nThe large data sets from the project are freely available for other researchers to use upon request and some can be accessed from the Folding@home website.<ref name=\"typepad: Simbios\"/><ref name=\"papers for free\"/> The Pande lab has collaborated with other molecular dynamics systems such as the [[Blue Gene]] supercomputer,<ref name=\"10.1038/sj.embor.7400108\"/> and they share Folding@home's key software with other researchers, so that the algorithms which benefited Folding@home may aid other scientific areas.<ref name=\"typepad: Simbios\"/> In 2011, they released the open-source Copernicus software, which is based on Folding@home's MSM and other parallelizing methods and aims to improve the efficiency and scaling of molecular simulations on large [[computer cluster]]s or [[supercomputer]]s.<ref name=\"Pronk et al, 2011\"/><ref name=\"Copernicus download\"/> Summaries of all scientific findings from Folding@home are posted on the Folding@home website after publication.<ref name=\"papers\"/>\n\n=== Alzheimer's disease ===\n{{Multiple image|footer= Alzheimer's disease is linked to the aggregation of amyloid beta protein fragments in the brain (right). Researchers have used Folding@home to simulate this aggregation process, to better understand the cause of the disease.|image1= Amyloid 01big1.jpg|image2= Amyloid 02big1.jpg|image3= Amyloid 03big1.jpg}}\n\n[[Alzheimer's disease]] is an incurable [[neurodegeneration|neurodegenerative]] disease which most often affects the elderly and accounts for more than half of all cases of [[dementia]]. Its exact cause remains unknown, but the disease is identified as a [[proteopathy|protein misfolding disease]]. Alzheimer's is associated with toxic [[protein aggregation|aggregations]] of the [[amyloid beta]] (A\u03b2) [[peptide]], caused by A\u03b2 misfolding and clumping together with other A\u03b2 peptides. These A\u03b2 aggregates then grow into significantly larger [[senile plaques]], a pathological marker of Alzheimer's disease.<ref name=\"10.2119/2007-00100.Irvine\"/><ref name=\"10.1001/archneurol.2007.56\"/><ref name=\"10.1074/jbc.R800036200\"/> Due to the heterogeneous nature of these aggregates, experimental methods such as [[X-ray crystallography]] and [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR) have had difficulty characterizing their structures. Moreover, atomic simulations of A\u03b2 aggregation are highly demanding computationally due to their size and complexity.<ref name=\"10.1063/1.3010881\"/><ref name=\"10.1371/journal.pone.0021776\"/>\n\nPreventing A\u03b2 aggregation is a promising method to developing therapeutic drugs for Alzheimer's disease, according to Drs. Naeem and Fazili in a [[literature review]] article.<ref name=\"10.1007/s12013-011-9200-x\"/> In 2008, Folding@home simulated the dynamics of A\u03b2 aggregation in atomic detail over timescales of the order of tens of seconds. Prior studies were only able to simulate about 10 microseconds. Folding@home was able to simulate A\u03b2 folding for six orders of magnitude longer than formerly possible. Researchers used the results of this study to identify a [[beta hairpin]] that was a major source of molecular interactions within the structure.<ref name=\"10.1038/cr.2010.57\"/> The study helped prepare the Pande lab for future aggregation studies and for further research to find a small peptide which may stabilize the aggregation process.<ref name=\"10.1063/1.3010881\"/>\n\nIn December 2008, Folding@home found several small drug candidates which appear to inhibit the toxicity of A\u03b2 aggregates.<ref name=\"typepad: possible alz. drug\"/> In 2010, in close cooperation with the Center for Protein Folding Machinery, these drug leads began to be tested on [[biological tissue]].<ref name=\"diseases FAQ\"/> In 2011, Folding@home completed simulations of several [[mutation]]s of A\u03b2 that appear to stabilize the aggregate formation, which could aid in the development of therapeutic drug therapies for the disease and greatly assist with experimental [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy]] studies of A\u03b2 [[oligomer]]s.<ref name=\"10.1371/journal.pone.0021776\"/><ref name=\"10.1021/jm201332p\"/> Later that year, Folding@home began simulations of various A\u03b2 fragments to determine how various natural enzymes affect the structure and folding of A\u03b2.<ref name=\"forum: 6871\"/><ref name=\"description: 6571\"/>\n\n=== Huntington's disease ===\n[[Huntington's disease]] is a neurodegenerative [[genetic disorder]] that is associated with protein misfolding and aggregation. [[Polyglutamine tract|Excessive repeats]] of the [[glutamine]] amino acid at the [[N-terminus]] of the [[huntingtin protein]] cause aggregation, and although the behavior of the repeats is not completely understood, it does lead to the cognitive decline associated with the disease.<ref name=\"10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60111-1\"/> As with other aggregates, there is difficulty in experimentally determining its structure.<ref name=\"10.1016/j.jmb.2009.01.032\"/> Scientists are using Folding@home to study the structure of the huntingtin protein aggregate and to predict how it forms, assisting with [[rational drug design]] methods to stop the aggregate formation.<ref name=\"diseases FAQ\"/> The N17 fragment of the huntingtin protein accelerates this aggregation, and while there have been several mechanisms proposed, its exact role in this process remains largely unknown.<ref name=\"10.1038/nchembio.279\"/> Folding@home has simulated this and other fragments to clarify their roles in the disease.<ref name=\"forum: 8021 in beta\"/> Since 2008, its drug design methods for Alzheimer's disease have been applied to Huntington's.<ref name=\"diseases FAQ\"/>\n\n=== Cancer ===\nMore than half of all known cancers involve [[mutations]] of [[p53]], a [[tumor suppressor]] protein present in every cell which regulates the [[cell cycle]] and signals for [[cell death]] in the event of damage to [[DNA]]. Specific mutations in p53 can disrupt these functions, allowing an abnormal cell to continue growing unchecked, resulting in the development of [[tumors]]. Analysis of these mutations helps explain the root causes of p53-related cancers.<ref name=\"10.1126/science.1905840\"/> In 2004, Folding@home was used to perform the first molecular dynamics study of the refolding of p53's [[protein dimer]] in an [[water model|all-atom simulation of water]]. The simulation's results agreed with experimental observations and gave insights into the refolding of the dimer that were formerly unobtainable.<ref name=\"10.1016/j.jmb.2004.10.083\"/> This was the first [[peer review]]ed publication on cancer from a distributed computing project.<ref name=\"FAH publishes cancer results\"/> The following year, Folding@home powered a new method to identify the amino acids crucial for the stability of a given protein, which was then used to study mutations of p53. The method was reasonably successful in identifying cancer-promoting mutations and determined the effects of specific mutations which could not otherwise be measured experimentally.<ref name=\"10.1016/j.jmb.2005.12.083\"/>\n\nFolding@home is also used to study [[chaperone (protein)|protein chaperones]],<ref name=\"diseases FAQ\"/> [[heat shock protein]]s which play essential roles in cell survival by assisting with the folding of other proteins in the [[Macromolecular crowding|crowded]] and chemically stressful environment within a cell. Rapidly growing cancer cells rely on specific chaperones, and some chaperones play key roles in [[chemotherapy]] resistance. Inhibitions to these specific chaperones are seen as potential modes of action for efficient chemotherapy drugs or for reducing the spread of cancer.<ref name=\"10.1016/j.biopha.2011.04.025\"/> Using Folding@home and working closely with the Center for Protein Folding Machinery, the Pande lab hopes to find a drug which inhibits those chaperones involved in cancerous cells.<ref name=\"typepad: nanomedicine ce\"/> Researchers are also using Folding@home to study other molecules related to cancer, such as the enzyme [[Src kinase]], and some forms of the [[Engrailed (gene)|engrailed]] [[homeodomain]]: a large protein which may be involved in many diseases, including cancer.<ref name=\"typepad: protomol b4\"/><ref name=\"description: 180\"/> In 2011, Folding@home began simulations of the dynamics of the small [[Trefoil knot fold|knottin]] protein EETI, which can identify [[carcinoma]]s in [[medical imaging|imaging scan]]s by binding to [[cell surface receptor|surface receptor]]s of cancer cells.<ref name=\"forum: 7600 in beta\"/><ref name=\"description: 7600\"/>\n\n[[Interleukin 2]] (IL-2) is a protein that helps [[T cell]]s of the [[immune system]] attack pathogens and tumors. However, its use as a cancer treatment is restricted due to serious side effects such as [[pulmonary edema]]. IL-2 binds to these pulmonary cells differently than it does to T cells, so IL-2 research involves understanding the differences between these binding mechanisms. In 2012, Folding@home assisted with the discovery of a mutant form of IL-2 which is three hundred times more effective in its immune system role but carries fewer side effects. In experiments, this altered form significantly outperformed natural IL-2 in impeding tumor growth. [[Pharmaceutical companies]] have expressed interest in the mutant molecule, and the [[National Institutes of Health]] are testing it against a large variety of tumor models to try to accelerate its development as a therapeutic.<ref name=\"scientists boost IL-2 potency\"/><ref name=\"10.1038/nature10975\"/>\n\n=== Osteogenesis imperfecta ===\n[[Osteogenesis imperfecta]], known as brittle bone disease, is an incurable genetic bone disorder which can be lethal.

Ideally, a drug should act very specifically, and bind only to its target without interfering with other biological functions. However, it is difficult to precisely determine where and [[binding affinity|how tightly]] two molecules will bind. Due to limits in computing power, current ''[[in silico]]'' methods usually must trade speed for [[accuracy]]; e.g., use rapid [[protein docking]] methods instead of computationally costly [[free energy calculation]]s. Folding@home's computing performance allows researchers to use both methods, and evaluate their efficiency and reliability.<ref name=\"Press FAQ\"/><ref name=\"typepad: drug design methods\"/><ref name=\"10.1063/1.2221680\"/> Computer-assisted drug design has the potential to expedite and lower the costs of drug discovery.<ref name=\"10.1093/bib/bbp023\"/> In 2010, Folding@home used MSMs and free energy calculations to predict the native state of the [[villin]] protein to within 1.8 [[angstrom]] (\u00c5) [[root mean square deviation]] (RMSD) from the [[crystalline structure]] experimentally determined through [[X-ray crystallography]]. This accuracy has implications to future [[protein structure prediction]] methods, including for [[intrinsically unstructured proteins]].<ref name=\"10.1038/cr.2010.57\"/> Scientists have used Folding@home to research [[drug resistance]] by studying [[vancomycin]], an antibiotic [[drug of last resort]], and [[beta-lactamase]], a protein that can break down antibiotics like [[penicillin]].<ref name=\"description: 10721\"/><ref name=\"typepad: drug targets\"/>\n\nChemical activity occurs along a protein's [[active site]]. Traditional drug design methods involve tightly binding to this site and blocking its activity, under the assumption that the target protein exists in one rigid structure. However, this approach works for approximately only 15% of all proteins. Proteins contain [[allosteric site]]s which, when bound to by small molecules, can alter a protein's conformation and ultimately affect the protein's activity. These sites are attractive drug targets, but locating them is very [[Analysis of algorithms|computationally costly]]. In 2012, Folding@home and MSMs were used to identify allosteric sites in three medically relevant proteins: beta-lactamase, [[interleukin-2]], and [[RNase H]].<ref name=\"typepad: drug targets\"/><ref name=\"10.1073/pnas.1209309109\"/>\n\nApproximately half of all known [[antibiotic]]s interfere with the workings of a bacteria's [[ribosome]], a large and complex biochemical machine that performs [[protein biosynthesis]] by [[translation (biology)|translating]] [[messenger RNA]] into proteins. [[Macrolide antibiotics]] clog the ribosome's exit tunnel, preventing synthesis of essential bacterial proteins. In 2007, the Pande lab received a [[grant (money)|grant]] to study and design new antibiotics.<ref name=\"diseases FAQ\"/> In 2008, they used Folding@home to study the interior of this tunnel and how specific molecules may affect it.<ref name=\"10.1073/pnas.0801795105\"/> The full structure of the ribosome was determined only as of 2011, and Folding@home has also simulated [[ribosomal protein]]s, as many of their functions remain largely unknown.<ref name=\"description: 5765\"/>\n\n==Potential applications in biomedical research==\nThere are many more [[proteopathy#list of proteopathies|protein misfolding promoted diseases]] that can be benefited from Folding@home to either discern the misfolded protein structure or the misfolding kinetics, and assist in drug design in the future.  The often fatal [[prion diseases]] is among the most significant.\n\n===Prion diseases===\n{{Synthesis|section|date=March 2020}}\n[[Prion]] (PrP) is a [[cell membrane|transmembrane]] cellular protein found widely in [[eukaryotic cells]].  In mammals, it is more abundant in the [[central nervous system]].  Although its function is unknown, its high conservation among species indicates an important role in the cellular function.  The conformational change from the normal prion protein (PrPc, stands for cellular) to the disease causing [[isoform]] PrPSc (stands for prototypical prion disease\u2013[[scrapie]]) causes a host of diseases collectly known as [[transmissible spongiform encephalopathies]] (TSEs), including [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (BSE) in bovine, [[Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease]] (CJD) and [[fatal insomnia]] in human, [[chronic wasting disease]] (CWD) in the deer family.  The conformational change is widely accepted as the result of [[protein misfolding]].  What distinguishes TSEs from other protein misfolding diseases is its transmissible nature.

A user can start their own team, or they can join an existing team. In some cases, a team may have their own community-driven sources of help or recruitment such as an [[Internet forum]].<ref name=\"Extreme overclocking forum\"/> The points can foster friendly competition between individuals and teams to compute the most for the project, which can benefit the folding community and accelerate scientific research.<ref name=\"Points FAQ\"/><ref name=\"10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160922\"/><ref name=\"MaximumPC Chimp Challenge\"/> Individual and team statistics are posted on the Folding@home website.<ref name=\"Points FAQ\"/>\n\nIf a user does not form a new team, or does not join an existing team, that user automatically becomes part of a \"Default\" team. This \"Default\" team has a team number of \"0\". Statistics are accumulated for this \"Default\" team as well as for specially named teams.\n\n== Software ==\nFolding@home software at the user's end involves three primary components: work units, cores, and a client.\n\n=== Work units ===\nA work unit is the protein data that the client is asked to process. Work units are a fraction of the simulation between the states in a [[Markov model]]. After the work unit has been downloaded and completely processed by a volunteer's computer, it is returned to Folding@home servers, which then award the volunteer the credit points.  This cycle repeats automatically.<ref name=\"10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160922\"/> All work units have associated deadlines, and if this deadline is exceeded, the user may not get credit and the unit will be automatically reissued to another participant. As protein folding occurs serially, and many work units are generated from their predecessors, this allows the overall simulation process to proceed normally if a work unit is not returned after a reasonable period of time. Due to these deadlines, the minimum system requirement for Folding@home is a Pentium&nbsp;3 450&nbsp;MHz CPU with [[Streaming SIMD Extensions]] (SSE).<ref name=\"Main FAQ\"/> However, work units for high-performance clients have a much shorter deadline than those for the uniprocessor client, as a major part of the scientific benefit is dependent on rapidly completing simulations.<ref name=\"SMP FAQ\"/>\n\nBefore public release, work units go through several [[quality assurance]] steps to keep problematic ones from becoming fully available. These testing stages include internal, beta, and advanced, before a final full release across Folding@home.<ref name=\"typepad: more transparency\"/> Folding@home's work units are normally processed only once, except in the rare event that errors occur during processing. If this occurs for three different users, the unit is automatically pulled from distribution.<ref name=\"forum: Gromacs cannot continue\"/><ref name=\"forum: 6803(4,66,255)\"/> The Folding@home support forum can be used to differentiate between issues arising from problematic hardware and bad work units.<ref name=\"forum: troubleshooting bad WUs\"/>\n\n=== Cores ===\n{{main|List of Folding@home cores}}\nSpecialized molecular dynamics programs, referred to as \"FahCores\" and often abbreviated \"cores\", perform the calculations on the work unit as a [[background process]]. A large majority of Folding@home's cores are based on [[GROMACS]],<ref name=\"10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160922\"/> one of the fastest and most popular molecular dynamics software packages, which largely consists of manually optimized [[assembly language]] code and hardware optimizations.<ref name=\"10.1002/jcc.20703\"/><ref name=\"10.1021/ct700301q\"/> Although GROMACS is [[open-source software]] and there is a cooperative effort between the Pande lab and GROMACS developers, Folding@home uses a [[closed-source]] license to help ensure data validity.<ref name=\"Gromacs FAQ\"/> Less active cores include ProtoMol and SHARPEN. Folding@home has used [[AMBER]], [[CPMD]], [[Desmond (software)|Desmond]], and [[TINKER]], but these have since been retired and are no longer in active service.<ref name=\"Open Source FAQ\"/><ref name=\"FAQ index\"/><ref name=\"typepad: update on new FahCores\"/> Some of these cores perform [[explicit water model|explicit solvation]] calculations in which the surrounding [[solvent]] (usually water) is modeled atom-by-atom; while others perform [[implicit solvation]] methods, where the solvent is treated as a mathematical continuum.<ref name=\"10.1002/jcc.21209\"/><ref name=\"Petaflop FAQ\"/> The core is separate from the client to enable the scientific methods to be updated automatically without requiring a client update. The cores periodically create calculation [[application checkpointing|checkpoints]] so that if they are interrupted they can resume work from that point upon startup.<ref name=\"10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160922\"/>\n\n=== Client ===\n\n[[File:Folding@home Fedora25.png|thumb|Folding@Home running on Fedora 25]]\n\nA Folding@home participant installs a [[client (computing)|client]] [[computer program|program]] on their [[personal computer]]. The user interacts with the client, which manages the other software components in the background. Through the client, the user may pause the folding process, open an event log, check the work progress, or view personal statistics.<ref name=\"Uni Guide\"/> The computer clients run continuously in the [[background (computer software)|background]] at a very low priority, using idle processing power so that normal computer use is unaffected.<ref name=\"Main FAQ\"/> The maximum CPU use can be adjusted via client settings.<ref name=\"Uni Guide\"/><ref name=\"forum: can FAH damage PC?\"/> The client connects to a Folding@home [[server (computing)|server]] and retrieves a work unit and may also download the appropriate core for the client's settings, operating system, and the underlying hardware architecture. After processing, the work unit is returned to the Folding@home servers. Computer clients are tailored to [[uniprocessor]] and [[multi-core processor]] systems, and [[graphics processing unit]]s. The diversity and power of each [[hardware architecture]] provides Folding@home with the ability to efficiently complete many types of simulations in a timely manner (in a few weeks or months rather than years), which is of significant scientific value. Together, these clients allow researchers to study biomedical questions formerly considered impractical to tackle computationally.<ref name=\"Press FAQ\"/><ref name=\"10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160922\"/><ref name=\"SMP FAQ\"/>\n\nProfessional software developers are responsible for most of Folding@home's code, both for the client and server-side. The development team includes programmers from Nvidia, ATI, Sony, and Cauldron Development.<ref name=\"typepad: how does dev get done\"/> Clients can be downloaded only from the official Folding@home website or its commercial partners, and will only interact with Folding@home computer files. They will upload and download data with Folding@home's data servers (over [[Computer port (software)|port]]&nbsp;8080, with 80 as an alternate), and the communication is verified using 2048-bit [[digital signature]]s.<ref name=\"Main FAQ\"/><ref name=\"Uninstall\"/> While the client's [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) is open-source,<ref name=\"FAHControl source code\"/> the client is [[proprietary software]] citing security and scientific integrity as the reasons.<ref name=\"FAH license\"/><ref name=\"forum: FAH EULA\"/><ref name=\"help ubuntu\"/>\n\nHowever, this rationale of using proprietary software is disputed since while the license could be enforceable in the legal domain retrospectively, it doesn't practically prevent the modification (also known as [[Patch (computing)|patching]]) of the executable [[binary file]]s. Likewise, [[binary-only software|binary-only]] distribution does not prevent the malicious modification of executable binary-code, either through a [[man-in-the-middle attack]] while being downloaded via the internet,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.leviathansecurity.com/blog/the-case-of-the-modified-binaries|title=The Case of the Modified Binaries|website=Leviathan Security}}</ref> or by the redistribution of binaries by a third-party that have been previously modified either in their binary state (i.e. [[Patch (computing)|patched]]),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-usa-02/clowes/bh-us-02-clowes-binaries.ppt|title=Fixing/Making Holes in ELF Binaries/Programs - Black Hat}}</ref> or by decompiling<ref>probably using tools such as [https://github.com/thorkill/eresi ERESI]</ref> and recompiling them after modification.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4309771/how-to-disassemble-modify-and-then-reassemble-a-linux-executable|title=x86 - How to disassemble, modify and then reassemble a Linux executable?|website=Stack Overflow}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/185/how-do-i-add-functionality-to-an-existing-binary-executable|title=linux - How do I add functionality to an existing binary executable?|website=Reverse Engineering Stack Exchange}}</ref> These modifications are possible unless the binary files&nbsp;\u2013 and the transport channel&nbsp;\u2013 are [[digital signature|signed]] and the recipient person/system is able to verify the digital signature, in which case unwarranted modifications should be detectable, but not always.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-16/materials/us-16-Nipravsky-Certificate-Bypass-Hiding-And-Executing-Malware-From-A-Digitally-Signed-Executable-wp.pdf |title=Certificate Bypass: Hiding and Executing Malware from a Digitally Signed Executable |publisher=[[Deep Instinct]] |website=BlackHat.com |date=August 2016}}</ref> Either way, since in the case of Folding@home the input data and output result processed by the client-software are both digitally signed,<ref name=\"Main FAQ\"/><ref name=\"Uninstall\"/> the integrity of work can be verified independently from the integrity of the client software itself.\n\nFolding@home uses the [[Cosm (software)|Cosm]] software libraries for networking.<ref name=\"10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160922\"/><ref name=\"typepad: how does dev get done\"/> Folding@home was launched on October&nbsp;1, 2000, and was the first distributed computing project aimed at bio-molecular systems.<ref name=\"10.1039/C1CP22100K\"/> Its first client was a [[screensaver]], which would run while the computer was not otherwise in use.<ref name=\"10.1126/science.290.5498.1903\"/><ref name=\"Executive summary\"/> In 2004, the Pande lab collaborated with [[David P. Anderson]] to test a supplemental client on the open-source [[Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing|BOINC]] framework. This client was released to closed beta in April 2005;<ref name=\"FAH for BOINC soon\"/> however, the method became unworkable and was shelved in June 2006.<ref name=\"High-Per FAQ\"/>\n\n==== Graphics processing units ====\nThe specialized hardware of [[graphics processing unit]]s (GPU) is designed to accelerate rendering of 3-D&nbsp;graphics applications such as video games and can significantly outperform CPUs for some types of calculations. GPUs are one of the most powerful and rapidly growing computing platforms, and many scientists and researchers are pursuing [[general-purpose computing on graphics processing units]] (GPGPU). However, GPU hardware is difficult to use for non-graphics tasks and usually requires significant algorithm restructuring and an advanced understanding of the underlying architecture.<ref name=\"10.1111/j.1467-8659.2007.01012.x\"/> Such customization is challenging, more so to researchers with limited software development resources. Folding@home uses the [[open-source software|open-source]] [[OpenMM]] [[library (computing)|library]], which uses a [[bridge pattern|bridge design pattern]] with two [[application programming interface]] (API) levels to interface molecular simulation software to an underlying hardware architecture. With the addition of hardware optimizations, OpenMM-based GPU simulations need no significant modification but achieve performance nearly equal to hand-tuned GPU code, and greatly outperform CPU implementations.<ref name=\"10.1002/jcc.21209\"/><ref name=\"10.1109/MCSE.2010.27\"/>\n\nBefore 2010, the computing reliability of GPGPU consumer-grade hardware was largely unknown, and circumstantial evidence related to the lack of built-in [[error detection and correction]] in GPU memory raised reliability concerns. In the first large-scale test of GPU scientific accuracy, a 2010 study of over 20,000 hosts on the Folding@home network detected [[soft error]]s in the memory subsystems of two-thirds of the tested GPUs. These errors strongly correlated to board architecture, though the study concluded that reliable GPU computing was very feasible as long as attention is paid to the hardware traits, such as software-side error detection.<ref name=\"10.1109/CCGRID.2010.84\"/>\n\nThe first generation of Folding@home's GPU client (GPU1) was released to the public on October&nbsp;2, 2006,<ref name=\"High-Per FAQ\"/> delivering a 20\u201330 times speedup for some calculations over its CPU-based [[GROMACS]] counterparts.<ref name=\"ATI FAQ\"/> It was the first time GPUs had been used for either distributed computing or major molecular dynamics calculations.<ref name=\"typepad: GPU news\"/><ref name=\"978-3-642-14389-2\"/> GPU1 gave researchers significant knowledge and experience with the development of [[General-purpose computing on graphics processing units|GPGPU]] software, but in response to scientific inaccuracies with [[DirectX]], on April&nbsp;10, 2008 it was succeeded by GPU2, the second generation of the client.<ref name=\"ATI FAQ\"/><ref name=\"typepad: GPU2 open beta\"/> Following the introduction of GPU2, GPU1 was officially retired on June&nbsp;6.<ref name=\"ATI FAQ\"/> Compared to GPU1, GPU2 was more scientifically reliable and productive, ran on [[ATI (brand)|ATI]] and [[CUDA]]-enabled [[Nvidia]] GPUs, and supported more advanced algorithms, larger proteins, and real-time visualization of the protein simulation.<ref name=\"typepad: GPU2 goes live\"/><ref name=\"typepad: GPU2 going well\"/> Following this, the third generation of Folding@home's GPU client (GPU3) was released on May&nbsp;25, 2010. While [[Backward compatibility|backward compatible]] with GPU2, GPU3 was more stable, efficient, and flexibile in its scientific abilities,<ref name=\"typepad: GPU3 prep\"/> and used OpenMM on top of an [[OpenCL]] framework.<ref name=\"typepad: GPU3 prep\"/><ref name=\"typepad: GPU3 open beta\"/> Although these GPU3 clients did not natively support the operating systems [[Linux]] and [[macOS]], Linux users with Nvidia graphics cards were able to run them through the [[Wine (software)|Wine]] software application.<ref name=\"forum: 7.1.38 released\"/><ref name=\"forum: GPU3 headless guide\"/> GPUs remain Folding@home's most powerful platform in [[FLOPS]]. As of November 2012, GPU clients account for 87% of the entire project's x86 FLOPS throughput.<ref name=\"FAH osstats2\"/>\n\nNative support for Nvidia and AMD graphics cards under Linux was introduced with FahCore 17, which uses OpenCL rather than CUDA.<ref name=\"forum: core17 Linux\"/>\n\n==== PlayStation 3 ====\n{{further|Life with PlayStation}}\n[[File:LifeWithPlayStation Folding.jpg|thumb|The PlayStation 3's ''Life With PlayStation'' client displays a 3-D animation of the protein being folded]]\n\nFrom March 2007 until November 2012, Folding@home took advantage of the computing power of [[PlayStation 3]]s. At the time of its inception, its main [[stream processing|streaming]] [[Cell (microprocessor)|Cell processor]] delivered a 20 times speed increase over PCs for some calculations, processing power which could not be found on other systems such as the [[Xbox 360]].<ref name=\"Press FAQ\"/><ref name=\"Biotech 27\"/> The PS3's high speed and efficiency introduced other opportunities for worthwhile optimizations according to [[Amdahl's law]], and significantly changed the tradeoff between computing efficiency and overall accuracy, allowing the use of more complex molecular models at little added computing cost.<ref name=\"10.1002/jcc.21054\"/> This allowed Folding@home to run biomedical calculations that would have been otherwise infeasible computationally.<ref name=\"cnn ps3\"/>\n\nThe PS3 client was developed in a collaborative effort between [[Sony]] and the Pande lab and was first released as a standalone client on March&nbsp;23, 2007.<ref name=\"Press FAQ\"/><ref name=\"PS3 to study cancer\"/> Its release made Folding@home the first distributed computing project to use PS3s.<ref name=\"PS3 research project\"/> On September&nbsp;18 of the following year, the PS3 client became a channel of [[Life with PlayStation]] on its launch.<ref name=\"Life With PS3 live\"/><ref name=\"typepad: life with PS\"/> In the types of calculations it can perform, at the time of its introduction, the client fit in between a CPU's flexibility and a GPU's speed.<ref name=\"10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160922\"/> However, unlike clients running on [[personal computer]]s, users were unable to perform other activities on their PS3 while running Folding@home.<ref name=\"cnn ps3\"/> The PS3's uniform console environment made [[technical support]] easier and made Folding@home more [[user friendly]].<ref name=\"Press FAQ\"/> The PS3 also had the ability to stream data quickly to its GPU, which was used for real-time atomic-level visualizing of the current protein dynamics.<ref name=\"10.1002/jcc.21054\"/>\n\nOn November 6, 2012, Sony ended support for the Folding@home PS3 client and other services available under Life with PlayStation. Over its lifetime of five years and seven months, more than 15 million users contributed over 100 million hours of computing to Folding@home, greatly assisting the project with disease research. Following discussions with the Pande lab, Sony decided to terminate the application. Pande considered the PlayStation 3 client a \"game changer\" for the project.<ref name=\"PS3 FAQ\"/><ref name=\"PS3 4.30 update, drop F@h\"/><ref name=\"LWP termination\"/>\n\n==== Multi-core processing client ====\nFolding@home can use the [[parallel computing]] abilities of modern multi-core processors. The ability to use several CPU cores simultaneously allows completing the full simulation far faster. Working together, these CPU cores complete single work units proportionately faster than the standard uniprocessor client. This method is scientifically valuable because it enables much longer simulation trajectories to be performed in the same amount of time, and reduces the traditional difficulties of scaling a large simulation to many separate processors.<ref name=\"typepad: what does SMP do\"/> A 2007 publication in the ''[[Journal of Molecular Biology]]'' relied on multi-core processing to simulate the folding of part of the [[villin]] protein approximately 10 times longer than was possible with a single-processor client, in agreement with experimental folding rates.<ref name=\"10.1016/j.jmb.2007.09.069\"/>\n\nIn November 2006, first-generation [[symmetric multiprocessing]] (SMP) clients were publicly released for open beta testing, referred to as SMP1.<ref name=\"High-Per FAQ\"/> These clients used [[Message Passing Interface]] (MPI) communication protocols for parallel processing, as at that time the GROMACS cores were [[Thread-safe|not designed]] to be used with multiple threads.<ref name=\"SMP FAQ\"/> This was the first time a distributed computing project had used MPI.<ref name=\"typepad: new client dev\"/> Although the clients performed well in [[Unix]]-based operating systems such as Linux and macOS, they were troublesome under [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].<ref name=\"typepad: what does SMP do\"/><ref name=\"typepad: new client dev\"/> On January&nbsp;24, 2010, SMP2, the second generation of the SMP clients and the successor to SMP1, was released as an open beta and replaced the complex MPI with a more reliable [[Thread (computer science)|thread]]-based implementation.<ref name=\"SMP2 release\"/><ref name=\"typepad: how does dev get done\"/>\n\nSMP2 supports a trial of a special category of ''bigadv'' work units, designed to simulate proteins that are unusually large and computationally intensive and have a great scientific priority. These units originally required a minimum of eight CPU cores,<ref name=\"bigadv\"/> which was raised to sixteen later, on February&nbsp;7, 2012.<ref name=\"typepad: update on bigadv-16\"/> Along with these added hardware requirements over standard SMP2 work units, they require more system resources such as [[random-access memory]] (RAM) and [[Internet bandwidth]]. In return, users who run these are rewarded with a 20% increase over SMP2's bonus point system.<ref name=\"typepad: bigadv points change\"/> The bigadv category allows Folding@home to run especially demanding simulations for long times that had formerly required use of supercomputing [[Computer cluster#Compute clusters|clusters]] and could not be performed anywhere else on Folding@home.<ref name=\"bigadv\"/> Many users with hardware able to run bigadv units have later had their hardware setup deemed ineligible for bigadv work units when CPU core minimums were increased, leaving them only able to run the normal SMP work units. This frustrated many users who invested significant amounts of money into the program only to have their hardware be obsolete for bigadv purposes shortly after. As a result, Pande announced in January 2014 that the bigadv program would end on January 31, 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://foldingathome.org/home/revised-plans-for-bigadv-ba-experiment/ |title=Revised plans for BigAdv (BA) experiment |author=Vijay Pande |date=January 15, 2014 |access-date=October 6, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==== V7 ====\n[[File:F@h v7 novice shot.png|thumb|A sample image of the V7 client in Novice mode running under [[Windows&nbsp;7]]. In addition to a variety of controls and user details, V7 presents work unit information, such as its state, calculation progress, ETA, credit points, identification numbers, and description.]]\n\nThe V7 client is the seventh and latest generation of the Folding@home client software, and is a full rewrite and unification of the prior clients for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[macOS]], and [[Linux]] operating systems.<ref name=\"V7 install guide\"/><ref name=\"typepad: V7 in open beta\"/> It was released on March&nbsp;22, 2012.<ref name=\"typepad: v7 rollout\"/> Like its predecessors, V7 can run Folding@home in the background at a very low [[scheduling priority|priority]], allowing other applications to use CPU resources as they need. It is designed to make the installation, start-up, and operation more user-friendly for novices, and offer greater scientific flexibility to researchers than prior clients.<ref name=\"typepad: ATI core 16 released\"/> V7 uses [[Trac]] for [[Bug tracking system|managing its bug tickets]] so that users can see its development process and provide feedback.<ref name=\"typepad: V7 in open beta\"/>\n\nV7 consists of four integrated elements. The user typically interacts with V7's open-source [[Graphical user interface|GUI]], named FAHControl.<ref name=\"FAHControl source code\"/><ref name=\"Ticket #736\"/> This has Novice, Advanced, and Expert user interface modes, and has the ability to monitor, configure, and control many remote folding clients from one computer. FAHControl directs FAHClient, a [[backend as a service|back-end]] application that in turn manages each FAHSlot (or ''slot''). Each slot acts as replacement for the formerly distinct Folding@home v6 uniprocessor, SMP, or GPU computer clients, as it can download, process, and upload work units independently. The FAHViewer function, modeled after the PS3's viewer, displays a real-time 3-D rendering, if available, of the protein currently being processed.<ref name=\"V7 install guide\"/><ref name=\"typepad: V7 in open beta\"/>\n\n==== Google Chrome ====\nIn 2014, a client for the [[Google Chrome]] and [[Chromium (web browser)|Chromium]] web browsers was released, allowing users to run Folding@home in their web browser. The client used [[Google]]'s [[Native Client]] (NaCl) feature on Chromium-based web browsers to run the Folding@home code at near-native speed in a [[sandbox (computer security)|sandbox]] on the user's machine.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Pande|first1=Vijay|title=Adding a completely new way to fold, directly in the browser|url=https://foldingathome.org/home/adding-a-completely-new-way-to-fold-directly-in-the-browser/|website=foldingathome.org|publisher=Pande Lab, Stanford University|access-date=13 February 2015|date=24 February 2014}}</ref> Due to the phasing out of NaCL and changes at Folding@home, the web client was permanently shut down in June 2019.<ref>{{cite web |title=NaCL Web Client Shutdown Notice |url=http://nacl.foldingathome.org/ |website=Folding@Home |publisher=Folding@Home |accessdate=29 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== Android ====\nIn July 2015, a client for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] mobile phones was released on [[Google Play]] for devices running [[Android 4.4 KitKat]] or newer.<ref>{{cite web |first=Vijay |last=Pande |title=First full version of our Folding@Home client for Android Mobile phones |url=https://foldingathome.org/home/first-full-version-of-our-foldinghome-client-for-android-mobile-phones/ |work=Folding@Home |publisher=foldingathome.org |date=July 7, 2015 |access-date=May 31, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Folding@Home |url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sonymobile.androidapp.gridcomputing |work=[[Google Play]] |date=2016 |access-date=May 31, 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn the 16th of February 2018 the Android client, which was offered in cooperation with [[Sony Mobile|Sony]], was removed from the Google Play.

In October 2011, Anton and Folding@home were the two most powerful molecular dynamics systems.<ref name=\"typepad: comparison with Anton\"/> Anton is unique in its ability to produce single ultra-long computationally costly molecular trajectories,<ref name=\"10.1021/ja207470h\"/> such as one in 2010 which reached the millisecond range.<ref name=\"10.1145/1654059.1654099\"/><ref name=\"10.1126/science.1187409\"/> These long trajectories may be especially helpful for some types of biochemical problems.<ref name=\"10.1145/1364782.1364802\"/><ref name=\"10.1146/annurev-biophys-042910-155245\"/> However, Anton does not use Markov state models (MSM) for analysis. In 2011, the Pande lab constructed a MSM from two 100-[[microsecond|\u00b5s]] Anton simulations and found alternative folding pathways that were not visible through Anton's traditional analysis. They concluded that there was little difference between MSMs constructed from a limited number of long trajectories or one assembled from many shorter trajectories.<ref name=\"10.1021/ja207470h\"/> In June 2011 Folding@home added sampling of an Anton simulation in an effort to better determine how its methods compare to Anton's.<ref name=\"forum: 7610/7611 in beta\"/><ref name=\"description: 7610\"/> However, unlike Folding@home's shorter trajectories, which are more amenable to distributed computing and other parallelizing methods, longer trajectories do not require adaptive sampling to sufficiently sample the protein's [[phase space]]. Due to this, it is possible that a combination of Anton's and Folding@home's simulation methods would provide a more thorough sampling of this space.<ref name=\"10.1021/ja207470h\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Biology|Medicine}}\n* [[BOINC]]\n* [[Foldit]]\n* [[List of distributed computing projects]]\n* [[Comparison of software for molecular mechanics modeling]]\n* [[Molecular modeling on GPUs]]\n* [[SETI@home]]\n* [[Storage@home]]\n* [[Molecule editor]]\n* [[World Community Grid]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist\n| colwidth= 30em\n| refs =\n\n<!-- *** Books *** -->\n\n<ref name=\"978-0-340-66316-5\">{{cite book |last1= Collier |first1= Leslie |last2= Balows |first2= Albert |last3= Sussman |first3= Max |year= 1998 |chapter= |title= Topley and Wilson's Microbiology and Microbial Infections |edition= ninth |volume= 1, ''Virology'' |editor1-last= Mahy |editor1-first= Brian |editor2-last= Collier |editor2-first= Leslie |publisher= Arnold |location= London |isbn= 978-0-340-66316-5 |pages= 75\u201391}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"978-0-387-73905-2\">{{cite book |title= Collagen: structure and mechanics |last= Fratzl |first= Peter |year= 2008 |isbn= 978-0-387-73905-2 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=dyWFTqEtXXwC&lpg=PR1&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q&f=false |access-date= March 17, 2012}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"978-3-642-14389-2\">{{cite book |author1=Travis Desell |author2=Anthony Waters |author3=Malik Magdon-Ismail |author4=Boleslaw K.

project for performing [[molecular dynamics]] simulations of protein dynamics. Its initial focus was on [[protein folding]] but has shifted to more biomedical problems, such as [[Alzheimer's disease]], cancer, Coronavirus disease 2019, and Ebola virus disease. The project uses the idle CPU time of personal computers owned by volunteers who have installed the software on their systems. The project was started in October 2000 by the Pande Laboratory at [[Stanford University]], under the direction of Prof. Vijay S. Pande, who led the project until 2019.<ref name=\"About FAH\"/>{{Verify source|reason=The source doesn't even mention 'cancer', 'Ebola', 'COVID-19', 'idle' resources, or 'Vijay Pande'|date=April 2020}} Folding@home is currently led by Dr. Greg Bowman of Washington University School of Medicine, a former student of Dr. Pande.<ref name=\"FAH leadership change\"/>\n\nThe project has pioneered the utilization of [[central processing unit]]s (CPUs), [[graphics processing unit]]s (GPUs), [[PlayStation&nbsp;3]]s, [[Message Passing Interface]] (used for computing on [[multi-core processor]]s), and some [[Sony Xperia]] smartphones for distributed computing and scientific research. The project uses statistical [[simulation]] methodology that is a [[paradigm shift]] from traditional computing methods.<ref name=\"10.1016/j.ymeth.2010.06.002\"/> As part of the [[client\u2013server model]] [[network architecture]], the volunteered machines each receive pieces of a simulation (work units), complete them, and return them to the project's [[database server]]s, where the units are compiled into an overall simulation. Volunteers can track their contributions on the Folding@home website, which makes volunteers' participation competitive and encourages long-term involvement.ef>\nEdit summary (Briefly describe your changes)\n\nUnpiped link (COVID-19; Ebola; idle processing resources;  | copyedit (idle processing resources \u2192 idle CPU time)\n\n\nFolding@home is one of the world's fastest computing systems. With heightened interest in the project as a result of the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], the system achieved a speed of approximately 1.18 [[FLOPS|exaFLOPS]], or 2.36 x86 exaFLOPS, by April 8, 2020,<ref>{{cite web | url = https://archive.is/fISnM | title = Client Statistics by OS | author = Pande lab | publisher = Archive.is | accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref> making it the world's first [[Exascale computing|exaFLOP computing system]]. This level of performance from its large-scale computing network has allowed researchers to run [[Analysis of algorithms|computationally costly]] atomic-level simulations of protein folding thousands of times longer than formerly achieved. Since its launch on 1&nbsp;October&nbsp;2000, the Pande Lab has produced 223 [[Academic publishing|scientific research papers]] as a direct result of Folding@home.<ref name=\"papers-march-2020\">{{cite web |title=Papers & Results |url=https://foldingathome.org/papers-results/ |website=Folding@home.org |accessdate=13 March 2020}}</ref> Results from the project's simulations agree well with experiments.<ref name=\"10.1021/ja9090353\"/><ref name=\"10.1073/pnas.1003962107\"/><ref name=\"10.1038/nature01160\"/>\n\n== Background ==\n{{further|Protein folding}}\n[[File:Protein folding.png|thumb|A protein before and after folding. It starts in an unstable [[random coil]] state and finishes in its native state conformation.]]\n\n[[Protein]]s are an essential component to many biological functions and participate in virtually all processes within [[Cell (biology)|biological cell]]s. They often act as [[enzyme]]s, performing biochemical reactions including [[cell signaling]], molecular transportation, and [[Cell cycle#Regulation of eukaryotic cell cycle|cellular regulation]]. As structural elements, some proteins act as a type of [[cytoskeleton|skeleton for cells]], and as [[antibodies]], while other proteins participate in the [[immune system]]. Before a protein can take on these roles, it must fold into a functional [[Protein tertiary structure|three-dimensional structure]], a process that often occurs spontaneously and is dependent on interactions within its [[amino acid]] sequence and interactions of the amino acids with their surroundings. Protein folding is driven by the search to find the most energetically favorable conformation of the protein, i.e., its [[native state]]. Thus, understanding protein folding is critical to understanding what a protein does and how it works, and is considered a holy grail of [[computational biology]].<ref name=\"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000452\"/><ref name=\"10.1126/science.309.5731.78b\"/> Despite folding occurring within a [[macromolecular crowding|crowded cellular environment]], it typically proceeds smoothly. However, due to a protein's chemical properties or other factors, proteins may [[protein misfolding|misfold]], that is, fold down the wrong pathway and end up misshapen. Unless cellular mechanisms can destroy or refold misfolded proteins, they can subsequently [[Protein aggregation|aggregate]] and cause a variety of debilitating diseases.<ref name=\"10.1002/iub.117\"/> Laboratory experiments studying these processes can be limited in scope and atomic detail, leading scientists to use physics-based computing models that, when complementing experiments, seek to provide a more complete picture of protein folding, misfolding, and aggregation.<ref name=\"10.1016/j.abb.2007.05.014\"/><ref name=\"10.1016/j.cbpa.2008.02.011\"/>\n\nDue to the complexity of proteins' conformation or [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]] (the set of possible shapes a protein can take), and limits in computing power, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations have been severely limited in the timescales which they can study. While most proteins typically fold in the order of milliseconds,<ref name=\"10.1016/j.abb.2007.05.014\"/><ref name=\"10.1146/annurev.biophys.34.040204.144447\"/> before 2010, simulations could only reach nanosecond to microsecond timescales.<ref name=\"10.1021/ja9090353\"/> General-purpose [[supercomputer]]s have been used to simulate protein folding, but such systems are intrinsically costly and typically shared among many research groups. Further, because the computations in kinetic models occur serially, strong [[scalability|scaling]] of traditional molecular simulations to these architectures is exceptionally difficult.<ref name=\"978-1-58603-796-3\"/><ref name=\"10.1002/bip.10219\"/> Moreover, as protein folding is a [[stochastic process]] and can statistically vary over time, it is challenging computationally to use long simulations for comprehensive views of the folding process.<ref name=\"10.1016/j.sbi.2010.10.006\"/><ref name=\"10.1137/06065146X\"/>\n\n[[File:ACBP MSM from Folding@home.tiff|thumb|Folding@home uses [[Markov state model]]s, like the one diagrammed here, to model the possible shapes and folding pathways a protein can take as it condenses from its initial randomly coiled state (left) into its native 3-D structure (right).]]\nProtein folding does not occur in one step.<ref name=\"10.1002/iub.117\"/> Instead, proteins spend most of their folding time, nearly 96% in some cases,<ref name=\"10.1016/j.sbi.2011.12.001\"/> ''waiting'' in various intermediate [[protein conformation|conformational]] states, each a local [[thermodynamic free energy]] minimum in the protein's [[energy landscape]]. Through a process known as [[adaptive sampling]], these conformations are used by Folding@home as starting points for a [[set (mathematics)|set]] of simulation trajectories. As the simulations discover more conformations, the trajectories are restarted from them, and a [[Hidden Markov model|Markov state model]] (MSM) is gradually created from this cyclic process. MSMs are [[discrete-time]] [[master equation]] models which describe a biomolecule's conformational and energy landscape as a set of distinct structures and the short transitions between them. The adaptive sampling Markov state model method significantly increases the efficiency of simulation as it avoids computation inside the local energy minimum itself, and is amenable to distributed computing (including on [[GPUGRID]]) as it allows for the statistical aggregation of short, independent simulation trajectories.<ref name=\"Simulation FAQ\"/> The amount of time it takes to construct a Markov state model is inversely proportional to the number of parallel simulations run, i.e., the number of processors available. In other words, it achieves linear [[parallelization]], leading to an approximately four [[orders of magnitude]] reduction in overall serial calculation time. A completed MSM may contain tens of thousands of sample states from the protein's [[phase space]] (all the conformations a protein can take on) and the transitions between them. The model illustrates folding events and pathways (i.e., routes) and researchers can later use kinetic clustering to view a coarse-grained representation of the otherwise highly detailed model.

Such [[therapies]] include the use of engineered molecules to alter the production of a given protein, help destroy a misfolded protein, or assist in the folding process.<ref name=\"10.1038/nature02265\"/> The combination of computational molecular modeling and experimental analysis has the possibility to fundamentally shape the future of molecular medicine and the [[drug design|rational design of therapeutics]],<ref name=\"10.1016/j.cbpa.2008.02.011\"/> such as expediting and lowering the costs of [[drug discovery]].<ref name=\"10.1093/bib/bbp023\"/> The goal of the first five years of Folding@home was to make advances in understanding folding, while the current goal is to understand misfolding and related disease, especially Alzheimer's.<ref name=\"Press FAQ\"/>\n\nThe simulations run on Folding@home are used in conjunction with laboratory experiments,<ref name=\"10.1016/j.sbi.2010.10.006\"/> but researchers can use them to study how folding ''[[in vitro]]'' differs from folding in native cellular environments. This is advantageous in studying aspects of folding, misfolding, and their relationships to disease that are difficult to observe experimentally. For example, in 2011, Folding@home simulated protein folding inside a [[ribosome|ribosomal]] exit tunnel, to help scientists better understand how natural confinement and crowding might influence the folding process.<ref name=\"forum: 7808/7809 to FAH\"/><ref name=\"10.1073/pnas.0608256104\"/> Furthermore, scientists typically employ chemical [[denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturants]] to unfold proteins from their stable native state. It is not generally known how the denaturant affects the protein's refolding, and it is difficult to experimentally determine if these denatured states contain residual structures which may influence folding behavior.

Its exact cause remains unknown, but the disease is identified as a [[proteopathy|protein misfolding disease]]. Alzheimer's is associated with toxic [[protein aggregation|aggregations]] of the [[amyloid beta]] (A\u03b2) [[peptide]], caused by A\u03b2 misfolding and clumping together with other A\u03b2 peptides. These A\u03b2 aggregates then grow into significantly larger [[senile plaques]], a pathological marker of Alzheimer's disease.<ref name=\"10.2119/2007-00100.Irvine\"/><ref name=\"10.1001/archneurol.2007.56\"/><ref name=\"10.1074/jbc.R800036200\"/> Due to the heterogeneous nature of these aggregates, experimental methods such as [[X-ray crystallography]] and [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR) have had difficulty characterizing their structures.

Prior studies were only able to simulate about 10 microseconds. Folding@home was able to simulate A\u03b2 folding for six orders of magnitude longer than formerly possible.

However, its use as a cancer treatment is restricted due to serious side effects such as [[pulmonary edema]]. IL-2 binds to these pulmonary cells differently than it does to T cells, so IL-2 research involves understanding the differences between these binding mechanisms. In 2012, Folding@home assisted with the discovery of a mutant form of IL-2 which is three hundred times more effective in its immune system role but carries fewer side effects. In experiments, this altered form significantly outperformed natural IL-2 in impeding tumor growth.

Ideally, a drug should act very specifically, and bind only to its target without interfering with other biological functions. However, it is difficult to precisely determine where and [[binding affinity|how tightly]] two molecules will bind. Due to limits in computing power, current ''[[in silico]]'' methods usually must trade speed for [[accuracy]]; e.g., use rapid [[protein docking]] methods instead of computationally costly [[free energy calculation]]s. Folding@home's computing performance allows researchers to use both methods, and evaluate their efficiency and reliability.<ref name=\"Press FAQ\"/><ref name=\"typepad: drug design methods\"/><ref name=\"10.1063/1.2221680\"/> Computer-assisted drug design has the potential to expedite and lower the costs of drug discovery.<ref name=\"10.1093/bib/bbp023\"/> In 2010, Folding@home used MSMs and free energy calculations to predict the native state of the [[villin]] protein to within 1.8 [[angstrom]] (\u00c5) [[root mean square deviation]] (RMSD) from the [[crystalline structure]] experimentally determined through [[X-ray crystallography]].

Traditional drug design methods involve tightly binding to this site and blocking its activity, under the assumption that the target protein exists in one rigid structure. However, this approach works for approximately only 15% of all proteins. Proteins contain [[allosteric site]]s which, when bound to by small molecules, can alter a protein's conformation and ultimately affect the protein's activity. These sites are attractive drug targets, but locating them is very [[Analysis of algorithms|computationally costly]].

A user can start their own team, or they can join an existing team. In some cases, a team may have their own community-driven sources of help or recruitment such as an [[Internet forum]].<ref name=\"Extreme overclocking forum\"/> The points can foster friendly competition between individuals and teams to compute the most for the project, which can benefit the folding community and accelerate scientific research.<ref name=\"Points FAQ\"/><ref name=\"10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160922\"/><ref name=\"MaximumPC Chimp Challenge\"/> Individual and team statistics are posted on the Folding@home website.<ref name=\"Points FAQ\"/>\n\nIf a user does not form a new team, or does not join an existing team, that user automatically becomes part of a \"Default\" team. This \"Default\" team has a team number of \"0\". Statistics are accumulated for this \"Default\" team as well as for specially named teams.\n\n== Software ==\nFolding@home software at the user's end involves three primary components: work units, cores, and a client.\n\n=== Work units ===\nA work unit is the protein data that the client is asked to process. Work units are a fraction of the simulation between the states in a [[Markov model]]. After the work unit has been downloaded and completely processed by a volunteer's computer, it is returned to Folding@home servers, which then award the volunteer the credit points.  This cycle repeats automatically.<ref name=\"10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160922\"/> All work units have associated deadlines, and if this deadline is exceeded, the user may not get credit and the unit will be automatically reissued to another participant. As protein folding occurs serially, and many work units are generated from their predecessors, this allows the overall simulation process to proceed normally if a work unit is not returned after a reasonable period of time. Due to these deadlines, the minimum system requirement for Folding@home is a Pentium&nbsp;3 450&nbsp;MHz CPU with [[Streaming SIMD Extensions]] (SSE).<ref name=\"Main FAQ\"/> However, work units for high-performance clients have a much shorter deadline than those for the uniprocessor client, as a major part of the scientific benefit is dependent on rapidly completing simulations.<ref name=\"SMP FAQ\"/>\n\nBefore public release, work units go through several [[quality assurance]] steps to keep problematic ones from becoming fully available. These testing stages include internal, beta, and advanced, before a final full release across Folding@home.<ref name=\"typepad: more transparency\"/> Folding@home's work units are normally processed only once, except in the rare event that errors occur during processing. If this occurs for three different users, the unit is automatically pulled from distribution.<ref name=\"forum: Gromacs cannot continue\"/><ref name=\"forum: 6803(4,66,255)\"/> The Folding@home support forum can be used to differentiate between issues arising from problematic hardware and bad work units.<ref name=\"forum: troubleshooting bad WUs\"/>\n\n=== Cores ===\n{{main|List of Folding@home cores}}\nSpecialized molecular dynamics programs, referred to as \"FahCores\" and often abbreviated \"cores\", perform the calculations on the work unit as a [[background process]]. A large majority of Folding@home's cores are based on [[GROMACS]],<ref name=\"10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160922\"/> one of the fastest and most popular molecular dynamics software packages, which largely consists of manually optimized [[assembly language]] code and hardware optimizations.<ref name=\"10.1002/jcc.20703\"/><ref name=\"10.1021/ct700301q\"/> Although GROMACS is [[open-source software]] and there is a cooperative effort between the Pande lab and GROMACS developers, Folding@home uses a [[closed-source]] license to help ensure data validity.<ref name=\"Gromacs FAQ\"/> Less active cores include ProtoMol and SHARPEN. Folding@home has used [[AMBER]], [[CPMD]], [[Desmond (software)|Desmond]], and [[TINKER]], but these have since been retired and are no longer in active service.<ref name=\"Open Source FAQ\"/><ref name=\"FAQ index\"/><ref name=\"typepad: update on new FahCores\"/> Some of these cores perform [[explicit water model|explicit solvation]] calculations in which the surrounding [[solvent]] (usually water) is modeled atom-by-atom; while others perform [[implicit solvation]] methods, where the solvent is treated as a mathematical continuum.<ref name=\"10.1002/jcc.21209\"/><ref name=\"Petaflop FAQ\"/> The core is separate from the client to enable the scientific methods to be updated automatically without requiring a client update. The cores periodically create calculation [[application checkpointing|checkpoints]] so that if they are interrupted they can resume work from that point upon startup.<ref name=\"10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160922\"/>\n\n=== Client ===\n\n[[File:Folding@home Fedora25.png|thumb|Folding@Home running on Fedora 25]]\n\nA Folding@home participant installs a [[client (computing)|client]] [[computer program|program]] on their [[personal computer]]. The user interacts with the client, which manages the other software components in the background. Through the client, the user may pause the folding process, open an event log, check the work progress, or view personal statistics.<ref name=\"Uni Guide\"/> The computer clients run continuously in the [[background (computer software)|background]] at a very low priority, using idle processing power so that normal computer use is unaffected.<ref name=\"Main FAQ\"/> The maximum CPU use can be adjusted via client settings.<ref name=\"Uni Guide\"/><ref name=\"forum: can FAH damage PC?\"/> The client connects to a Folding@home [[server (computing)|server]] and retrieves a work unit and may also download the appropriate core for the client's settings, operating system, and the underlying hardware architecture. After processing, the work unit is returned to the Folding@home servers. Computer clients are tailored to [[uniprocessor]] and [[multi-core processor]] systems, and [[graphics processing unit]]s. The diversity and power of each [[hardware architecture]] provides Folding@home with the ability to efficiently complete many types of simulations in a timely manner (in a few weeks or months rather than years), which is of significant scientific value. Together, these clients allow researchers to study biomedical questions formerly considered impractical to tackle computationally.<ref name=\"Press FAQ\"/><ref name=\"10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160922\"/><ref name=\"SMP FAQ\"/>\n\nProfessional software developers are responsible for most of Folding@home's code, both for the client and server-side. The development team includes programmers from Nvidia, ATI, Sony, and Cauldron Development.<ref name=\"typepad: how does dev get done\"/> Clients can be downloaded only from the official Folding@home website or its commercial partners, and will only interact with Folding@home computer files. They will upload and download data with Folding@home's data servers (over [[Computer port (software)|port]]&nbsp;8080, with 80 as an alternate), and the communication is verified using 2048-bit [[digital signature]]s.<ref name=\"Main FAQ\"/><ref name=\"Uninstall\"/> While the client's [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) is open-source,<ref name=\"FAHControl source code\"/> the client is [[proprietary software]] citing security and scientific integrity as the reasons.<ref name=\"FAH license\"/><ref name=\"forum: FAH EULA\"/><ref name=\"help ubuntu\"/>\n\nHowever, this rationale of using proprietary software is disputed since while the license could be enforceable in the legal domain retrospectively, it doesn't practically prevent the modification (also known as [[Patch (computing)|patching]]) of the executable [[binary file]]s. Likewise, [[binary-only software|binary-only]] distribution does not prevent the malicious modification of executable binary-code, either through a [[man-in-the-middle attack]] while being downloaded via the internet,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.leviathansecurity.com/blog/the-case-of-the-modified-binaries|title=The Case of the Modified Binaries|website=Leviathan Security}}</ref> or by the redistribution of binaries by a third-party that have been previously modified either in their binary state (i.e. [[Patch (computing)|patched]]),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-usa-02/clowes/bh-us-02-clowes-binaries.ppt|title=Fixing/Making Holes in ELF Binaries/Programs - Black Hat}}</ref> or by decompiling<ref>probably using tools such as [https://github.com/thorkill/eresi ERESI]</ref> and recompiling them after modification.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4309771/how-to-disassemble-modify-and-then-reassemble-a-linux-executable|title=x86 - How to disassemble, modify and then reassemble a Linux executable?|website=Stack Overflow}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/185/how-do-i-add-functionality-to-an-existing-binary-executable|title=linux - How do I add functionality to an existing binary executable?|website=Reverse Engineering Stack Exchange}}</ref> These modifications are possible unless the binary files&nbsp;\u2013 and the transport channel&nbsp;\u2013 are [[digital signature|signed]] and the recipient person/system is able to verify the digital signature, in which case unwarranted modifications should be detectable, but not always.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-16/materials/us-16-Nipravsky-Certificate-Bypass-Hiding-And-Executing-Malware-From-A-Digitally-Signed-Executable-wp.pdf |title=Certificate Bypass: Hiding and Executing Malware from a Digitally Signed Executable |publisher=[[Deep Instinct]] |website=BlackHat.com |date=August 2016}}</ref> Either way, since in the case of Folding@home the input data and output result processed by the client-software are both digitally signed,<ref name=\"Main FAQ\"/><ref name=\"Uninstall\"/> the integrity of work can be verified independently from the integrity of the client software itself.\n\nFolding@home uses the [[Cosm (software)|Cosm]] software libraries for networking.<ref name=\"10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160922\"/><ref name=\"typepad: how does dev get done\"/> Folding@home was launched on October&nbsp;1, 2000, and was the first distributed computing project aimed at bio-molecular systems.<ref name=\"10.1039/C1CP22100K\"/> Its first client was a [[screensaver]], which would run while the computer was not otherwise in use.<ref name=\"10.1126/science.290.5498.1903\"/><ref name=\"Executive summary\"/> In 2004, the Pande lab collaborated with [[David P. Anderson]] to test a supplemental client on the open-source [[Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing|BOINC]] framework. This client was released to closed beta in April 2005;<ref name=\"FAH for BOINC soon\"/> however, the method became unworkable and was shelved in June 2006.<ref name=\"High-Per FAQ\"/>\n\n==== Graphics processing units ====\nThe specialized hardware of [[graphics processing unit]]s (GPU) is designed to accelerate rendering of 3-D&nbsp;graphics applications such as video games and can significantly outperform CPUs for some types of calculations. GPUs are one of the most powerful and rapidly growing computing platforms, and many scientists and researchers are pursuing [[general-purpose computing on graphics processing units]] (GPGPU). However, GPU hardware is difficult to use for non-graphics tasks and usually requires significant algorithm restructuring and an advanced understanding of the underlying architecture.<ref name=\"10.1111/j.1467-8659.2007.01012.x\"/> Such customization is challenging, more so to researchers with limited software development resources. Folding@home uses the [[open-source software|open-source]] [[OpenMM]] [[library (computing)|library]], which uses a [[bridge pattern|bridge design pattern]] with two [[application programming interface]] (API) levels to interface molecular simulation software to an underlying hardware architecture. With the addition of hardware optimizations, OpenMM-based GPU simulations need no significant modification but achieve performance nearly equal to hand-tuned GPU code, and greatly outperform CPU implementations.<ref name=\"10.1002/jcc.21209\"/><ref name=\"10.1109/MCSE.2010.27\"/>\n\nBefore 2010, the computing reliability of GPGPU consumer-grade hardware was largely unknown, and circumstantial evidence related to the lack of built-in [[error detection and correction]] in GPU memory raised reliability concerns. In the first large-scale test of GPU scientific accuracy, a 2010 study of over 20,000 hosts on the Folding@home network detected [[soft error]]s in the memory subsystems of two-thirds of the tested GPUs. These errors strongly correlated to board architecture, though the study concluded that reliable GPU computing was very feasible as long as attention is paid to the hardware traits, such as software-side error detection.<ref name=\"10.1109/CCGRID.2010.84\"/>\n\nThe first generation of Folding@home's GPU client (GPU1) was released to the public on October&nbsp;2, 2006,<ref name=\"High-Per FAQ\"/> delivering a 20\u201330 times speedup for some calculations over its CPU-based [[GROMACS]] counterparts.<ref name=\"ATI FAQ\"/> It was the first time GPUs had been used for either distributed computing or major molecular dynamics calculations.<ref name=\"typepad: GPU news\"/><ref name=\"978-3-642-14389-2\"/> GPU1 gave researchers significant knowledge and experience with the development of [[General-purpose computing on graphics processing units|GPGPU]] software, but in response to scientific inaccuracies with [[DirectX]], on April&nbsp;10, 2008 it was succeeded by GPU2, the second generation of the client.<ref name=\"ATI FAQ\"/><ref name=\"typepad: GPU2 open beta\"/> Following the introduction of GPU2, GPU1 was officially retired on June&nbsp;6.<ref name=\"ATI FAQ\"/> Compared to GPU1, GPU2 was more scientifically reliable and productive, ran on [[ATI (brand)|ATI]] and [[CUDA]]-enabled [[Nvidia]] GPUs, and supported more advanced algorithms, larger proteins, and real-time visualization of the protein simulation.<ref name=\"typepad: GPU2 goes live\"/><ref name=\"typepad: GPU2 going well\"/> Following this, the third generation of Folding@home's GPU client (GPU3) was released on May&nbsp;25, 2010. While [[Backward compatibility|backward compatible]] with GPU2, GPU3 was more stable, efficient, and flexibile in its scientific abilities,<ref name=\"typepad: GPU3 prep\"/> and used OpenMM on top of an [[OpenCL]] framework.<ref name=\"typepad: GPU3 prep\"/><ref name=\"typepad: GPU3 open beta\"/> Although these GPU3 clients did not natively support the operating systems [[Linux]] and [[macOS]], Linux users with Nvidia graphics cards were able to run them through the [[Wine (software)|Wine]] software application.<ref name=\"forum: 7.1.38 released\"/><ref name=\"forum: GPU3 headless guide\"/> GPUs remain Folding@home's most powerful platform in [[FLOPS]]. As of November 2012, GPU clients account for 87% of the entire project's x86 FLOPS throughput.<ref name=\"FAH osstats2\"/>\n\nNative support for Nvidia and AMD graphics cards under Linux was introduced with FahCore 17, which uses OpenCL rather than CUDA.<ref name=\"forum: core17 Linux\"/>\n\n==== PlayStation 3 ====\n{{further|Life with PlayStation}}\n[[File:LifeWithPlayStation Folding.jpg|thumb|The PlayStation 3's ''Life With PlayStation'' client displays a 3-D animation of the protein being folded]]\n\nFrom March 2007 until November 2012, Folding@home took advantage of the computing power of [[PlayStation 3]]s. At the time of its inception, its main [[stream processing|streaming]] [[Cell (microprocessor)|Cell processor]] delivered a 20 times speed increase over PCs for some calculations, processing power which could not be found on other systems such as the [[Xbox 360]].<ref name=\"Press FAQ\"/><ref name=\"Biotech 27\"/> The PS3's high speed and efficiency introduced other opportunities for worthwhile optimizations according to [[Amdahl's law]], and significantly changed the tradeoff between computing efficiency and overall accuracy, allowing the use of more complex molecular models at little added computing cost.<ref name=\"10.1002/jcc.21054\"/> This allowed Folding@home to run biomedical calculations that would have been otherwise infeasible computationally.<ref name=\"cnn ps3\"/>\n\nThe PS3 client was developed in a collaborative effort between [[Sony]] and the Pande lab and was first released as a standalone client on March&nbsp;23, 2007.<ref name=\"Press FAQ\"/><ref name=\"PS3 to study cancer\"/> Its release made Folding@home the first distributed computing project to use PS3s.<ref name=\"PS3 research project\"/> On September&nbsp;18 of the following year, the PS3 client became a channel of [[Life with PlayStation]] on its launch.<ref name=\"Life With PS3 live\"/><ref name=\"typepad: life with PS\"/> In the types of calculations it can perform, at the time of its introduction, the client fit in between a CPU's flexibility and a GPU's speed.<ref name=\"10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160922\"/> However, unlike clients running on [[personal computer]]s, users were unable to perform other activities on their PS3 while running Folding@home.<ref name=\"cnn ps3\"/> The PS3's uniform console environment made [[technical support]] easier and made Folding@home more [[user friendly]].<ref name=\"Press FAQ\"/> The PS3 also had the ability to stream data quickly to its GPU, which was used for real-time atomic-level visualizing of the current protein dynamics.<ref name=\"10.1002/jcc.21054\"/>\n\nOn November 6, 2012, Sony ended support for the Folding@home PS3 client and other services available under Life with PlayStation. Over its lifetime of five years and seven months, more than 15 million users contributed over 100 million hours of computing to Folding@home, greatly assisting the project with disease research. Following discussions with the Pande lab, Sony decided to terminate the application. Pande considered the PlayStation 3 client a \"game changer\" for the project.<ref name=\"PS3 FAQ\"/><ref name=\"PS3 4.30 update, drop F@h\"/><ref name=\"LWP termination\"/>\n\n==== Multi-core processing client ====\nFolding@home can use the [[parallel computing]] abilities of modern multi-core processors. The ability to use several CPU cores simultaneously allows completing the full simulation far faster. Working together, these CPU cores complete single work units proportionately faster than the standard uniprocessor client. This method is scientifically valuable because it enables much longer simulation trajectories to be performed in the same amount of time, and reduces the traditional difficulties of scaling a large simulation to many separate processors.<ref name=\"typepad: what does SMP do\"/> A 2007 publication in the ''[[Journal of Molecular Biology]]'' relied on multi-core processing to simulate the folding of part of the [[villin]] protein approximately 10 times longer than was possible with a single-processor client, in agreement with experimental folding rates.<ref name=\"10.1016/j.jmb.2007.09.069\"/>\n\nIn November 2006, first-generation [[symmetric multiprocessing]] (SMP) clients were publicly released for open beta testing, referred to as SMP1.<ref name=\"High-Per FAQ\"/> These clients used [[Message Passing Interface]] (MPI) communication protocols for parallel processing, as at that time the GROMACS cores were [[Thread-safe|not designed]] to be used with multiple threads.<ref name=\"SMP FAQ\"/> This was the first time a distributed computing project had used MPI.<ref name=\"typepad: new client dev\"/> Although the clients performed well in [[Unix]]-based operating systems such as Linux and macOS, they were troublesome under [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].<ref name=\"typepad: what does SMP do\"/><ref name=\"typepad: new client dev\"/> On January&nbsp;24, 2010, SMP2, the second generation of the SMP clients and the successor to SMP1, was released as an open beta and replaced the complex MPI with a more reliable [[Thread (computer science)|thread]]-based implementation.<ref name=\"SMP2 release\"/><ref name=\"typepad: how does dev get done\"/>\n\nSMP2 supports a trial of a special category of ''bigadv'' work units, designed to simulate proteins that are unusually large and computationally intensive and have a great scientific priority. These units originally required a minimum of eight CPU cores,<ref name=\"bigadv\"/> which was raised to sixteen later, on February&nbsp;7, 2012.<ref name=\"typepad: update on bigadv-16\"/> Along with these added hardware requirements over standard SMP2 work units, they require more system resources such as [[random-access memory]] (RAM) and [[Internet bandwidth]]. In return, users who run these are rewarded with a 20% increase over SMP2's bonus point system.<ref name=\"typepad: bigadv points change\"/> The bigadv category allows Folding@home to run especially demanding simulations for long times that had formerly required use of supercomputing [[Computer cluster#Compute clusters|clusters]] and could not be performed anywhere else on Folding@home.<ref name=\"bigadv\"/> Many users with hardware able to run bigadv units have later had their hardware setup deemed ineligible for bigadv work units when CPU core minimums were increased, leaving them only able to run the normal SMP work units. This frustrated many users who invested significant amounts of money into the program only to have their hardware be obsolete for bigadv purposes shortly after. As a result, Pande announced in January 2014 that the bigadv program would end on January 31, 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://foldingathome.org/home/revised-plans-for-bigadv-ba-experiment/ |title=Revised plans for BigAdv (BA) experiment |author=Vijay Pande |date=January 15, 2014 |access-date=October 6, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==== V7 ====\n[[File:F@h v7 novice shot.png|thumb|A sample image of the V7 client in Novice mode running under [[Windows&nbsp;7]]. In addition to a variety of controls and user details, V7 presents work unit information, such as its state, calculation progress, ETA, credit points, identification numbers, and description.]]\n\nThe V7 client is the seventh and latest generation of the Folding@home client software, and is a full rewrite and unification of the prior clients for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[macOS]], and [[Linux]] operating systems.<ref name=\"V7 install guide\"/><ref name=\"typepad: V7 in open beta\"/> It was released on March&nbsp;22, 2012.<ref name=\"typepad: v7 rollout\"/> Like its predecessors, V7 can run Folding@home in the background at a very low [[scheduling priority|priority]], allowing other applications to use CPU resources as they need. It is designed to make the installation, start-up, and operation more user-friendly for novices, and offer greater scientific flexibility to researchers than prior clients.<ref name=\"typepad: ATI core 16 released\"/> V7 uses [[Trac]] for [[Bug tracking system|managing its bug tickets]] so that users can see its development process and provide feedback.<ref name=\"typepad: V7 in open beta\"/>\n\nV7 consists of four integrated elements. The user typically interacts with V7's open-source [[Graphical user interface|GUI]], named FAHControl.<ref name=\"FAHControl source code\"/><ref name=\"Ticket #736\"/> This has Novice, Advanced, and Expert user interface modes, and has the ability to monitor, configure, and control many remote folding clients from one computer. FAHControl directs FAHClient, a [[backend as a service|back-end]] application that in turn manages each FAHSlot (or ''slot''). Each slot acts as replacement for the formerly distinct Folding@home v6 uniprocessor, SMP, or GPU computer clients, as it can download, process, and upload work units independently. The FAHViewer function, modeled after the PS3's viewer, displays a real-time 3-D rendering, if available, of the protein currently being processed.<ref name=\"V7 install guide\"/><ref name=\"typepad: V7 in open beta\"/>\n\n==== Google Chrome ====\nIn 2014, a client for the [[Google Chrome]] and [[Chromium (web browser)|Chromium]] web browsers was released, allowing users to run Folding@home in their web browser. The client used [[Google]]'s [[Native Client]] (NaCl) feature on Chromium-based web browsers to run the Folding@home code at near-native speed in a [[sandbox (computer security)|sandbox]] on the user's machine.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Pande|first1=Vijay|title=Adding a completely new way to fold, directly in the browser|url=https://foldingathome.org/home/adding-a-completely-new-way-to-fold-directly-in-the-browser/|website=foldingathome.org|publisher=Pande Lab, Stanford University|access-date=13 February 2015|date=24 February 2014}}</ref> Due to the phasing out of NaCL and changes at Folding@home, the web client was permanently shut down in June 2019.<ref>{{cite web |title=NaCL Web Client Shutdown Notice |url=http://nacl.foldingathome.org/ |website=Folding@Home |publisher=Folding@Home |accessdate=29 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== Android ====\nIn July 2015, a client for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] mobile phones was released on [[Google Play]] for devices running [[Android 4.4 KitKat]] or newer.<ref>{{cite web |first=Vijay |last=Pande |title=First full version of our Folding@Home client for Android Mobile phones |url=https://foldingathome.org/home/first-full-version-of-our-foldinghome-client-for-android-mobile-phones/ |work=Folding@Home |publisher=foldingathome.org |date=July 7, 2015 |access-date=May 31, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Folding@Home |url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sonymobile.androidapp.gridcomputing |work=[[Google Play]] |date=2016 |access-date=May 31, 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn the 16th of February 2018 the Android client, which was offered in cooperation with [[Sony Mobile|Sony]], was removed from the Google Play.

In October 2011, Anton and Folding@home were the two most powerful molecular dynamics systems.<ref name=\"typepad: comparison with Anton\"/> Anton is unique in its ability to produce single ultra-long computationally costly molecular trajectories,<ref name=\"10.1021/ja207470h\"/> such as one in 2010 which reached the millisecond range.<ref name=\"10.1145/1654059.1654099\"/><ref name=\"10.1126/science.1187409\"/> These long trajectories may be especially helpful for some types of biochemical problems.<ref name=\"10.1145/1364782.1364802\"/><ref name=\"10.1146/annurev-biophys-042910-155245\"/> However, Anton does not use Markov state models (MSM) for analysis. In 2011, the Pande lab constructed a MSM from two 100-[[microsecond|\u00b5s]] Anton simulations and found alternative folding pathways that were not visible through Anton's traditional analysis. They concluded that there was little difference between MSMs constructed from a limited number of long trajectories or one assembled from many shorter trajectories.<ref name=\"10.1021/ja207470h\"/> In June 2011 Folding@home added sampling of an Anton simulation in an effort to better determine how its methods compare to Anton's.<ref name=\"forum: 7610/7611 in beta\"/><ref name=\"description: 7610\"/> However, unlike Folding@home's shorter trajectories, which are more amenable to distributed computing and other parallelizing methods, longer trajectories do not require adaptive sampling to sufficiently sample the protein's [[phase space]]. Due to this, it is possible that a combination of Anton's and Folding@home's simulation methods would provide a more thorough sampling of this space.<ref name=\"10.1021/ja207470h\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Biology|Medicine}}\n* [[BOINC]]\n* [[Foldit]]\n* [[List of distributed computing projects]]\n* [[Comparison of software for molecular mechanics modeling]]\n* [[Molecular modeling on GPUs]]\n* [[SETI@home]]\n* [[Storage@home]]\n* [[Molecule editor]]\n* [[World Community Grid]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist\n| colwidth= 30em\n| refs =\n\n<!-- *** Books *** -->\n\n<ref name=\"978-0-340-66316-5\">{{cite book |last1= Collier |first1= Leslie |last2= Balows |first2= Albert |last3= Sussman |first3= Max |year= 1998 |chapter= |title= Topley and Wilson's Microbiology and Microbial Infections |edition= ninth |volume= 1, ''Virology'' |editor1-last= Mahy |editor1-first= Brian |editor2-last= Collier |editor2-first= Leslie |publisher= Arnold |location= London |isbn= 978-0-340-66316-5 |pages= 75\u201391}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"978-0-387-73905-2\">{{cite book |title= Collagen: structure and mechanics |last= Fratzl |first= Peter |year= 2008 |isbn= 978-0-387-73905-2 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=dyWFTqEtXXwC&lpg=PR1&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q&f=false |access-date= March 17, 2012}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"978-3-642-14389-2\">{{cite book |author1=Travis Desell |author2=Anthony Waters |author3=Malik Magdon-Ismail |author4=Boleslaw K.
