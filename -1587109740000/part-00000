The empty streets signify the quietness of the cities in the light of the lockdowns that have been enforced by governments globally to curb the spread of the Covid-19 virus among citizens. The video then shows Drake in a [[antechamber]], showcasing his many awards sitting in trophy cases; through the door, a painting of China's [[Mao Zedong|Chairman Mao]] by [[Andy Warhol]] is seen hanging on the wall. Drake then passes by a table covered with the\u00a0basketball jerseys\u00a0he is usually seen wearing courtside, including one emblazoned with the name \"Bryant\", honoring the late American basketball star, Kobe Bryant, who had died earlier the year from a [[Kobe Bryant death|helicopter crash]], on January 26, 2020. The scene then cuts to a foyer, as the rapper passes two sculptures by Japanese [[contemporary artist]] [[Takashi Murakami]]. The rapper is then seen sitting on \"the biggest kitchen island [...]\"\u00a0and the camera pans toward the quarter-mile-long dining room table. Drake continues moving through darkened rooms where portraits of \"lost and distanced\" heroes, including [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Nas]], [[Tupac]] and [[Snoop Dogg]], hang on the wall. He dances through a door to the pool area,\u00a0which features \"waneon lighting and cabana-like d\u00e9cor\". The video concludes with Drake in total darkness, \"only his white sneakers visible against the eerily black [[Toronto]] sky\". Fireworks erupt afterward, and the camera pans back to show the entirety of Drake's 35,000-square-foot, $100 million Toronto estate.\n\nIn the video, Drake is seen wearing a hoodie and a \"super rare\" Fall/Winter 2001 [[Raf Simons]] Riot Riot Riot Camo [[Flight jacket#The bomber jacket|Bomber]], an item [[Kanye West]] wore regularly during 2014 and 2015. A [[B\u00f6sendorfer]] piano is seen, which has a violet cover inscribed with skulls.\u00a0There's also a shot of what appears to be a recording contract,\u00a0ready to be signed on Drake's dining-room table.\n\nSources:<ref name=\"NPR\" /><ref name=\"Missed Video\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/9350688/drake-toosie-slide-video-what-you-missed|title=7 Things You Might Have Missed Inside Drake's House in 'Toosie Slide' Video|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|last=Saponara|first=Michael|date=April 3, 2020|accessdate=April 4, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Rap Up\" />\n\n==Credits and personnel==\nCredits adapted from [[Tidal (service)|Tidal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://listen.tidal.com/album/136183311/credits|title=Drake / Toosie Slide / Tidal|website=[[Tidal (service)|Tidal]]|accessdate=April 3, 2020}}</ref>\n{{div col}}\n* [[Drake (rapper)|Aubrey Graham]] \u2013 vocals, songwriter, composer\n* [[OZ (record producer)|Ozan Yildirim]] \u2013 songwriter, composer, production\n* [[40 (record producer)|Noah \"40\" Shebib]] \u2013 mixer\n* Noel Cadastre \u2013 assistant mixer, recording engineer\n* Chris Athens \u2013 mastering engineer\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Charts ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2020)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peak<br />position\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Australia ([[ARIA Charts|ARIA]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ariacharts.com.au/charts/singles-chart|title=ARIA Australian Top 50 Singles|publisher=[[Australian Recording Industry Association]]|date=April 13, 2020|accessdate=April 11, 2020}}</ref>\n| 3\n|-\n{{single chart|Austria|2|artist=Drake|song=Toosie Slide|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 16, 2020}}\n|-\n{{single chart|Flanders|40|artist=Drake|song=Toosie Slide|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 10, 2020}}\n|-\n{{single chart|Wallonia Tip|24|artist=Drake|song=Toosie Slide|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 10, 2020}}\n|-\n{{single chart|Canada|3|artist=Drake|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 14, 2020}}\n|-\n{{single chart|Czechdigital|12|year=2020|week=15|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 15, 2020}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Denmark ([[Tracklisten]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hitlisten.nu/default.asp?w=14&y=2020&list=t40|title=Track Top-40 Uge 14, 2020|publisher=[[Hitlisten]]|accessdate=April 15, 2020}}</ref>\n| 2\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Estonia ([[Eesti Tipp-40]])<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://ekspress.delfi.ee/areen/eesti-tipp-40-muusikas-sel-nadalal-paugutab-tradattack?id=89544845|title=EESTI TIPP-40 MUUSIKAS: Sel n\u00e4dalal paugutab Trad.Attack!|website=[[Eesti Ekspress]]|language=Estonian|access-date=April 14, 2020}}</ref>\n| 2\n|-\n{{single chart|Finland|9|artist=Drake|song=Toosie Slide|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 12, 2020}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| France ([[Syndicat National de l'\u00c9dition Phonographique|SNEP]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://snepmusique.com/les-tops/le-top-de-la-semaine/top-albums/?semaine=15?&annee=2020&categorie=Top%20Singles|title=Top Singles (Week 15, 2020)|publisher=[[Syndicat National de l'\u00c9dition Phonographique]]|language=French|accessdate=April 14, 2020}}</ref>\n| 12\n|-\n{{single chart|Germany2|5|songid=1977918|artist=Drake|song=Toosie Slide|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 10, 2020}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Greece ([[IFPI Greece|IFPI]])<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.gr/digital_ien.html|publisher=[[IFPI Greece]]|accessdate=April 14, 2020|title=Official IFPI Charts \u2013 Digital Singles Chart (International) \u2013 Week: 14/2020}}</ref>\n| 9\n|-\n{{single chart|Hungarysingle|28|year=2020|week=15|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 16, 2020}}\n|-\n{{single chart|Hungarystream|4|year=2020|week=15|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 16, 2020}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Iceland ([[Music of Iceland|Tonlist]])<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://plotutidindi.is/lagalistinn/|title=T\u00d3NLISTINN \u2013 Vika 15 \u2013 2020; Pl\u00f6tut\u00ed\u00f0indi}}</ref>\n| 13\n|-\n{{single chart|Ireland4|2|date=20200410|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 11, 2020}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Italy ([[Federazione Industria Musicale Italiana|FIMI]])<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fimi.it/top-of-the-music/classifiche.kl#/charts/3/2020/15|title=Top Singoli \u2013 Classifica settimanale WK 15|publisher=[[Federazione Industria Musicale Italiana]]|language=Italian|accessdate=April 11, 2020}}</ref>\n| 8\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Latvia ([[Latvijas Radio 5|Latvijas Top 40]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pieci.lv/lv/lr5/top40|title=Latvijas Top 40|publisher=[[Latvijas Radio]]|date=April 16, 2020|accessdate=April 16, 2020}}</ref>\n| 23\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Lithuania ([[AGATA (organization)|AGATA]])<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.agata.lt/lt/naujienos/savaites-klausomiausi-2020w15/|title=2020 15-os SAVAIT\u0116S (baland\u017eio 3-9 d.)

The empty streets signify the quietness of the cities in the light of the lockdowns that have been enforced by governments globally to curb the spread of the Covid-19 virus among citizens. The video then shows Drake in a [[antechamber]], showcasing his many awards sitting in trophy cases; through the door, a painting of China's [[Mao Zedong|Chairman Mao]] by [[Andy Warhol]] is seen hanging on the wall. Drake then passes by a table covered with the\u00a0basketball jerseys\u00a0he is usually seen wearing courtside, including one emblazoned with the name \"Bryant\", honoring the late American basketball star, Kobe Bryant, who had died earlier the year from a [[Kobe Bryant death|helicopter crash]], on January 26, 2020. The scene then cuts to a foyer, as the rapper passes two sculptures by Japanese [[contemporary artist]] [[Takashi Murakami]]. The rapper is then seen sitting on \"the biggest kitchen island [...]\"\u00a0and the camera pans toward the quarter-mile-long dining room table. Drake continues moving through darkened rooms where portraits of \"lost and distanced\" heroes, including [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Nas]], [[Tupac]] and [[Snoop Dogg]], hang on the wall. He dances through a door to the pool area,\u00a0which features \"waneon lighting and cabana-like d\u00e9cor\". The video concludes with Drake in total darkness, \"only his white sneakers visible against the eerily black [[Toronto]] sky\". Fireworks erupt afterward, and the camera pans back to show the entirety of Drake's 35,000-square-foot, $100 million Toronto estate.\n\nIn the video, Drake is seen wearing a hoodie and a \"super rare\" Fall/Winter 2001 [[Raf Simons]] Riot Riot Riot Camo [[Flight jacket#The bomber jacket|Bomber]], an item [[Kanye West]] wore regularly during 2014 and 2015.

Located approximately {{convert|20 |km}} west of the district headquarters town of [[Charkhi Dadri]], {{As of|2011|alt=as of the [[2011 Census of India]]}}, the village had 535 households with a total population of 2,578 of which 1,367 were male and 1,211 female.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bilawal  village|url=http://www.censusindia.gov.in/pca/SearchDetails.aspx?Id=62478|publisher=[[Census of India]]|accessdate=10 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nAfter the first War of Indian Independence (1857), the Sangwan family (Ch. Butaram Sangwan) migrates from Pichopa village i.e. 3&nbsp;km. away from Bilawal, Chaudhary has played a very crucial role to develop the village. Ch. Sangwan's entire family residing near bus stand of Bilawal. Subsequently, some Janghu Jats from Bhaloth village in the district Jhunjhunu also migrated to village Khorara (presently in Jhajhar District) and out of them a few families settled near a mound, presently forming the southern part of the village agricultural lands. A few families belonging to Suhag, Sangwan gotra from neighbouring village Atela Kalan lived near a pond (Amrana Johar), near the site of present village in northern side. In the aftermath of the 1857 events, the Raja of Jind was assigned the territories previously held by the Nawab of Dadri. Later it began to be called Dadri Tehsil of the Jind District.\n\nThe village derives its name from the invitation (Bulana) extended to the people by a ruler to settle at the present site. According to elders of the village, especially from Smt. Phushi Devi, wife of Chaudhary Dile Ram Janghu, who started to reside here in the 1870s, the incident is said to have occurred as follows. After a few years (about 1865 or so) for the land settlement of the region, the ruler of the then Native State of Jind is said to have visited this area. On his initiation, the headmen of both the Khordia and Atelia families got together and agreed to settle at the present site after the issue of their possession of cultivable land and habitation site had been settled. the same was done by earmarking a dividing line starting from east to west; thus Atelia mohalla or panna on the northern side and Khordia mohalla or Panna came to be settled in south of this area. This division in two parts of the village remains even today.\n\n== Jat gotras & Others ==\n* Beniwal\n* Janghu\n* Mahla\n* Nagel\n* Rangi\n* Sangwan\n* Suhag\n* Singal\n* Bhatti\n* Khatak\n* Tanwar\nIn this village, there are two major Jat Gotras: Janghu and Sangwan. They are said to have first settled at this place. The Janghus' ancestors had migrated from Khorara village and are also known as Bhalothia and Khordia in local parlance. The Sangwans came here from neighbouring Pichopa Kalan and they are called Atelias in the local dialect. On the basis of this, the land of the village both agricultural and residential had been demarked into two parts. the dividing line has been marked from East to West and divides the village in two 'pannas' or Mohallas i.e. Khordias in the southern part and Atelias in the northern part. Subsequently, a few people belonging to other gotras also settled here in both the pannas/mohallas.\n\n== Development over the years ==\nThe first primary school was opened here on the exhortations of Nihal Singh Takshak who, on behalf of Birla Education Trust, Pilani, formed a committee of the villagers comprising Shri Chand, Harnarain Suhag, Uddal Numberdar, Darya Singh etc. for this task. They took up the task with all seriousness, collected donations and got constructed the building. The school has been upgraded to Govt. Middle School recently. The village has a sub post office, a primary health centre, a Panchyat Bhawan in addition to having two Dharamsalas and a few temples. The village has a tradition of significantly contributing to the recruitment to Defence forces, para military forces, police and there are several ex-servicemen and presently serving personnel belonging to this village. Of late, with the advancement of education, several persons from this village have risen to the positions of teachers, headmasters, and other positions in higher educational institutions. Shri Rajpal Singh Beniwal and Shri Raghubir Singh Janghu, Ishwar Singh Janghu, Dharampal Mehla have recently retired from government service as headmasters. Likewise, several other persons are serving in the government, semi-government and other organizations and institutions including some in MNCs.

On the basis of this, the land of the village both agricultural and residential had been demarked into two parts. the dividing line has been marked from East to West and divides the village in two 'pannas' or Mohallas i.e. Khordias in the southern part and Atelias in the northern part. Subsequently, a few people belonging to other gotras also settled here in both the pannas/mohallas.\n\n== Development over the years ==\nThe first primary school was opened here on the exhortations of Nihal Singh Takshak who, on behalf of Birla Education Trust, Pilani, formed a committee of the villagers comprising Shri Chand, Harnarain Suhag, Uddal Numberdar, Darya Singh etc. for this task. They took up the task with all seriousness, collected donations and got constructed the building. The school has been upgraded to Govt. Middle School recently. The village has a sub post office, a primary health centre, a Panchyat Bhawan in addition to having two Dharamsalas and a few temples. The village has a tradition of significantly contributing to the recruitment to Defence forces, para military forces, police and there are several ex-servicemen and presently serving personnel belonging to this village.

Shri Rajpal Singh Beniwal and Shri Raghubir Singh Janghu, Ishwar Singh Janghu, Dharampal Mehla have recently retired from government service as headmasters. Likewise, several other persons are serving in the government, semi-government and other organizations and institutions including some in MNCs. In addition to following agricultural pursuits, some people are engaged in trade and transport business as well. The agricultural lands are irrigated with waters from tube wells and seasonal availability for some cultivated area of the village from the canal water from Loharu Lift Irrigation Scheme. The labouring class works at the nearby hillock of the village which is a part of Aravali Hill range located at about two kilometers east from the site of the village.\n\n== Notable persons ==\n* Deshram Jamadar (a subedar level post in British rule) was the very notable person from this village. 4 out of 7 grandsons are working with the Indian army and 2 are engineers, one doing MBBS. \n* \u091a\u094c\u0927\u0930\u0940 \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940 \u0930\u093f\u091b\u092a\u093e\u0932 \u0938\u093f\u0902\u0939 \u0939\u0935\u0932\u0926\u093e\u0930 served the Indian Army for years.

Trio was formed in 1980 by [[Stephan Remmler]], [[Gert Krawinkel|Gert \"Kralle\" Krawinkel]], and [[Peter Behrens (musician)|Peter Behrens]]. Released as a single in 1982 and featured on their 1981 [[Trio (Trio album)|eponymous debut album]], \"Da Da Da\" became a hit in [[Germany]] and about 30 other countries, selling 13 million copies worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|title= Trio |date= 29 October 2013 |publisher= Laut.de |url= http://www.laut.de/wortlaut/artists/t/trio/index.htm |accessdate= 18 January 2014 |language= de}}</ref> The lyrics were written by Stephan Remmler, the music by Gert \"Kralle\" Krawinkel. \"Da Da Da\" remains the band's biggest German hit and their only hit outside Germany.\n\n==Background and composition==\nIt is known in many language versions:\n* German version as \"{{lang|de|Da da da, ich lieb' dich nicht du liebst mich nicht aha aha aha}}\" (or simply \"Da Da Da\")\n* English version as \"Da Da Da I don't love you you don't love me\"\n* French version as \"Da Da Da je t'aime pas tu m'aimes pas\"\n\nThe song \"Da Da Da\" has become popular while being extremely repetitive. It was a product of the ''[[Neue Deutsche Welle]]'' (or NDW). However, Trio preferred the name ''Neue Deutsche Fr\u00f6hlichkeit'', which means \"New German Cheerfulness\", to describe their music. At that time, popular songs were based on extremely simple structures that were ornately produced. Trio's main principle was to remove almost all the ornamentation and polish from their songs, and to use the simplest practical structures (most of their songs were [[three-chord song]]s). For this reason, many of their songs are restricted to drums, guitar, vocals, and just one or maybe two other instruments, if any at all. Bass was used very infrequently until their later songs, and live shows often saw Remmler playing some simple pre-programmed rhythms and melodies on his small [[Casio VL-1]] keyboard while Behrens played his drums with one hand and ate an apple with the other. Remmler used a [[contact microphone]] on his throat to achieve a different [[timbre]] to his voice on lyrics where he stepped away from the regular mic.\n\nTrio was made up of:\n* [[Stephan Remmler]] \u2013 vocals, keyboards\n* [[Gert Krawinkel]] \u2013 guitar\n* [[Peter Behrens (musician)|Peter Behrens]] \u2013 drums\n\nIt had another three top ten hits in Germany until the end of 1983, then disbanded the following year.\n\n==Chart positions==\n* The song was a chart success in more than 30 countries.\n* The German version of \"Da Da Da\" reached No. 2 on the charts (April 1982). There were three versions: the single version for 3:23, a longer version for 6:36. The live version came in the album ''Trio live im Fr\u00fchjahr 82'' and goes on for 1:32. On the B-side of the 7\" single release was \"Sabine Sabine Sabine\", whereas the B-Side of the maxi-single carried two more songs: \"Halt mich fest ich werd verr\u00fcckt\" and \"Lady-O-Lady\".\n* In the UK, \"Da Da Da\" hit No. 2 in July 1982. The single version goes on for 3:23 and the longer version for 6:36.\n* In Canada, it peaked at No. 3 in December 1982.\n* In France, the song was made more popular in 1982 with Zam making a French version titled \"Da Da Da je t'aime pas tu m'aimes pas\".\n* In the US, the song peaked at No. 33 on the dance charts.<ref name=\"awards\"/> In 1997, the song gained further chart success when the CD of ''TRIO and Error'' was released as ''Da Da Da I Don't Love You You Don't Love Me Aha Aha Aha'' in the United States and was a US-only promo CD-single in response to the 1997 US [[Volkswagen]] commercial that featured the song \"Da Da Da I Don't Love You You Don't Love Me Aha Aha Aha\", often contracted to simply \"Da Da Da\". The re-release had some changes: two songs were added to the CD and the album was digitally remastered. The shorter version known as a radio edit version goes on for 2:49.\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Weekly charts===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n!scope=\"col\"|Chart (1982)\n!scope=\"col\"|Peak<br>position\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Australia ([[Kent Music Report]])<ref>{{cite magazine|title= Hits of the World |magazine= [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date= 6 November 1982 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=AiQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT76&dq=%22australia%22 |volume= 94 |issue= 44 |page= 53 |issn= 0006-2510}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|4\n|-\n{{singlechart|Austria|1|artist=Trio|song=Da da da ich lieb dich nicht du liebst mich nicht aha aha aha|rowheader=true|accessdate=26 May 2014}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Flanders|4|artist=Trio|song=Da da da ich lieb dich nicht du liebst mich nicht aha aha aha|rowheader=true|accessdate=26 May 2014}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Canadatopsingles|3|chartid=6944|rowheader=true|accessdate=26 May 2014}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Denmark ([[IFPI Denmark|IFPI]])<ref>{{cite magazine|title= Hits of the World |magazine= Billboard |volume= 94 |issue= 41 |date= 16 October 1982 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=miQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT116&dq=%22denmark%22 |page= 79 |issn= 0006-2510 |id= '''cf last week position'''}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|2\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|France ([[Institut fran\u00e7ais d'opinion publique|IFOP]])<ref>{{cite web|title= Le D\u00e9tail par Artiste |publisher= InfoDisc |id= Select \"Trio\" from the artist drop-down menu |url= http://www.infodisc.fr/Tubes_Artistes_T.php |accessdate= 14 May 2016 |language= fr}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|3\n|-\n{{singlechart|Ireland2|2|artist=Trio|rowheader=true|accessdate=25 June 2013}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Israel<ref>{{cite magazine|title= Hits of the World |magazine= Billboard |date= 18 September 1982 |page= 61 |volume= 94 |issue= 37 |issn= 0006-2510 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=OyQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT56&dq=%22israel%22}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|2\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Italy (Hit Parade Italia)<ref name=\"IT\">{{cite web|title= I singoli pi\u00f9 venduti del 1982 |language= it |url= http://www.hitparadeitalia.it/hp_yends/hpe1982.htm |publisher= Hit Parade Italia.

There were three versions: the single version for 3:23, a longer version for 6:36. The live version came in the album ''Trio live im Fr\u00fchjahr 82'' and goes on for 1:32. On the B-side of the 7\" single release was \"Sabine Sabine Sabine\", whereas the B-Side of the maxi-single carried two more songs: \"Halt mich fest ich werd verr\u00fcckt\" and \"Lady-O-Lady\".\n* In the UK, \"Da Da Da\" hit No. 2 in July 1982. The single version goes on for 3:23 and the longer version for 6:36.\n* In Canada, it peaked at No. 3 in December 1982.\n* In France, the song was made more popular in 1982 with Zam making a French version titled \"Da Da Da je t'aime pas tu m'aimes pas\".\n* In the US, the song peaked at No. 33 on the dance charts.<ref name=\"awards\"/> In 1997, the song gained further chart success when the CD of ''TRIO and Error'' was released as ''Da Da Da I Don't Love You You Don't Love Me Aha Aha Aha'' in the United States and was a US-only promo CD-single in response to the 1997 US [[Volkswagen]] commercial that featured the song \"Da Da Da I Don't Love You You Don't Love Me Aha Aha Aha\", often contracted to simply \"Da Da Da\". The re-release had some changes: two songs were added to the CD and the album was digitally remastered. The shorter version known as a radio edit version goes on for 2:49.\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Weekly charts===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n!scope=\"col\"|Chart (1982)\n!scope=\"col\"|Peak<br>position\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Australia ([[Kent Music Report]])<ref>{{cite magazine|title= Hits of the World |magazine= [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date= 6 November 1982 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=AiQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT76&dq=%22australia%22 |volume= 94 |issue= 44 |page= 53 |issn= 0006-2510}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|4\n|-\n{{singlechart|Austria|1|artist=Trio|song=Da da da ich lieb dich nicht du liebst mich nicht aha aha aha|rowheader=true|accessdate=26 May 2014}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Flanders|4|artist=Trio|song=Da da da ich lieb dich nicht du liebst mich nicht aha aha aha|rowheader=true|accessdate=26 May 2014}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Canadatopsingles|3|chartid=6944|rowheader=true|accessdate=26 May 2014}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Denmark ([[IFPI Denmark|IFPI]])<ref>{{cite magazine|title= Hits of the World |magazine= Billboard |volume= 94 |issue= 41 |date= 16 October 1982 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=miQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT116&dq=%22denmark%22 |page= 79 |issn= 0006-2510 |id= '''cf last week position'''}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|2\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|France ([[Institut fran\u00e7ais d'opinion publique|IFOP]])<ref>{{cite web|title= Le D\u00e9tail par Artiste |publisher= InfoDisc |id= Select \"Trio\" from the artist drop-down menu |url= http://www.infodisc.fr/Tubes_Artistes_T.php |accessdate= 14 May 2016 |language= fr}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|3\n|-\n{{singlechart|Ireland2|2|artist=Trio|rowheader=true|accessdate=25 June 2013}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Israel<ref>{{cite magazine|title= Hits of the World |magazine= Billboard |date= 18 September 1982 |page= 61 |volume= 94 |issue= 37 |issn= 0006-2510 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=OyQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT56&dq=%22israel%22}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|2\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Italy (Hit Parade Italia)<ref name=\"IT\">{{cite web|title= I singoli pi\u00f9 venduti del 1982 |language= it |url= http://www.hitparadeitalia.it/hp_yends/hpe1982.htm |publisher= Hit Parade Italia.

For this song, the trio took on the moniker of [[the Strangeloves]], and recorded the tune themselves, augmented by studio musicians (co-writer Berns was not involved in the studio recording).\n\nThe female vocalist heard half-screaming, half-singing \"Baby!\" in the middle of the track was an unknown [[Session musician|session]] singer.\n\nAlthough Feldman, Goldstein and Gottehrer used their real names in the writing and production credits of this single, they claimed the Strangeloves were actually three Australian brothers (and ex-sheep farmers) named Giles, Miles and Niles Strange. Feldman, Goldstein and Gottehrer dressed up in shaggy wigs and exotic clothing for publicity photos as the Strangeloves.\n\n\"I Want Candy\", the Strangeloves' second single, became a top 10 hit in Canada and hit No. 11 in the US.<ref name=\"O\"/> The record failed to chart in the UK\u2014or in the Strangeloves' so-called \"native\" country, Australia.\n\n==Cover versions==\n===Bow Wow Wow version===\n{{Infobox song\n| name       = I Want Candy\n| cover      = Bow wow wow candy standard international edition.jpg\n| alt        =\n| caption    = Standard cover art for UK and international vinyl editions\n| type       = single\n| artist     = [[Bow Wow Wow]]\n| album      = [[The Last of the Mohicans (EP)|The Last of the Mohicans]]\n| B-side     = King Kong\n| released   = 1982\n| format     =\n| recorded   =\n| studio     =\n| venue      =\n| genre      = [[New wave music|New wave]]\n| length     = 2:46\n| label      = [[RCA Records]]\n| writer     = {{hlist|Bert Berns|Bob Feldman|Jerry Goldstein|Richard Gottehrer}}\n| producer   = Bow Wow Wow\n| prev_title = [[Go Wild in the Country]]\n| prev_year  = 1982\n| next_title = [[Fools Rush In (Where Angels Fear to Tread)|Fools Rush In]]\n| next_year  = 1982\n| misc       = {{External music video|{{YouTube|JoXVYSV4Xcs|\"I Want Candy\"}}}}\n}}\n\nEnglish [[New wave music|new wave]] group [[Bow Wow Wow]] released their version as the first and only single from their EP ''[[The Last of the Mohicans (EP)|The Last of the Mohicans]]''.

Recovered individuals have reached up to {{convert|4|-|4.2|m|1}} in height, and an estimated {{convert|11.3|-|15|t}} in weight. The straight-tusked elephant probably lived in small herds, flourishing in [[interglacial]] periods, when its range would extend as far as Great Britain. Isolated tusks are often found while partial or whole skeletons are rare, and there is evidence of predation by early humans. It is the ancestral species of most [[dwarf elephant]]s that inhabited islands in the [[Mediterranean]].\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:Elephas antiquus Rom.JPG|left|thumb|Complete skeleton in Rome.]]\n''Palaeoloxodon antiquus'' was quite large, with individuals reaching {{convert|4|m|ft|1}} in height. Like other members of ''Paleoloxodon, P. antiquus'' possesses a well developed parieto-occipital crest (POC) at the top of the cranium, for anchoring the [[Splenius muscles|splenius]] as well as possibly the [[Rhomboid muscles|rhomboid]] muscles to support the large head, the largest proportionally and in absolute size among proboscideans. Two morphs of ''P. antiquus'' in Europe were previously suggested to exist in Europe based on POC variation, one more similar to ''P. namadicus'', but these were shown to be the result of [[Ontogeny|ontogenetic]] variation and [[Taphonomy|taphonomic distortion]].<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Larramendi|first=Asier|last2=Zhang|first2=Hanwen|last3=Palombo|first3=Maria Rita|last4=Ferretti|first4=Marco P.|date=February 2020|title=The evolution of Palaeoloxodon skull structure: Disentangling phylogenetic, sexually dimorphic, ontogenetic, and allometric morphological signals|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0277379119302690|journal=Quaternary Science Reviews|language=en|volume=229|pages=106090|doi=10.1016/j.quascirev.2019.106090}}</ref> One approximately 40-year-old male measured about {{convert|3.81|m|ft}} tall and weighed about {{convert|11.3|t|LT ST}}, while another from Montreuil weighed about {{convert|15|t|LT ST|1}} and was about {{convert|4.2|m|ft|1}} tall.<ref name=\"proboscideans\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Larramendi | first1 = A. | year = 2016 | title = Shoulder height, body mass and shape of proboscideans | journal = Acta Palaeontologica Polonica | volume = 61 | issue = | pages = | publisher = | jstor = | doi = 10.4202/app.00136.2014 | url = https://www.app.pan.pl/archive/published/app61/app001362014.pdf | format = | accessdate = }}</ref> and had long, slightly upward-curving tusks.<ref>{{cite book |editor-first=R.

Its arrival is co-incides with the replacement of [[Mammuthus meridionalis|''Mammuthus meridionalis'']] by [[Mammuthus trogontherii|''Mammuthus trogontherii'']], there appears to be no overlap between ''M. meridionalis'' and ''P. antiquus'', which suggests that the latter might have outcompeted the former.

One of the earliest finds is in an approximately 600,000-year-old site near Heidelberg, the location of the early human jawbone dubbed [[Mauer 1]]. Fossils were also found washed up in a course of the [[Neckar]] river. [[Isernia#La Pineta|Isernia la Pineta]] in Italy is likely to be the same age or slightly younger. Remains of lower jaws are well documented in these three locations, alongside stone artefacts and numerous bones of rhinos, wild cattle, hippos and horses. Since the remains of the trunks do not show human markings, extinction by natural causes can not be ruled out.\n\nThe clearest proof to date that this animal was among the prey of early humans was provided in 1948 in [[Lehringen]], Germany, near the [[Aller (Germany)|Aller]] river. A skeleton of a straight-tusked elephant was found with a [[yew]] [[spear]] between the ribs, and [[Lithic analysis|lithic]] artifacts around the head.

Its arrival is co-incides with the replacement of [[Mammuthus meridionalis|''Mammuthus meridionalis'']] by [[Mammuthus trogontherii|''Mammuthus trogontherii'']], there appears to be no overlap between ''M. meridionalis'' and ''P. antiquus'', which suggests that the latter might have outcompeted the former.

One of the earliest finds is in an approximately 600,000-year-old site near Heidelberg, the location of the early human jawbone dubbed [[Mauer 1]]. Fossils were also found washed up in a course of the [[Neckar]] river. [[Isernia#La Pineta|Isernia la Pineta]] in Italy is likely to be the same age or slightly younger. Remains of lower jaws are well documented in these three locations, alongside stone artefacts and numerous bones of rhinos, wild cattle, hippos and horses. Since the remains of the trunks do not show human markings, extinction by natural causes can not be ruled out.\n\nThe clearest proof to date that this animal was among the prey of early humans was provided in 1948 in [[Lehringen]], Germany, near the [[Aller (Germany)|Aller]] river.

The purpose of the joint venture was to create an international wing for the domestic carrier Thai Airways Company. SAS also provided operational, managerial, and marketing expertise, with training assistance aimed at building a fully independent national airline within the shortest possible time.

The airline later converted existing one-stop service (via Tokyo) to Los Angeles into non-stop services using the same aircraft type. Citing very high fuel costs, Thai discontinued the New York service in July 2008, even though the airline had been able to fill 80 per cent of the seats. The service to Los Angeles was again reverted to one-stop service via Seoul on 1 May 2012, leaving the airline without a non-stop service between Thailand and North America. The A340s used have been phased out using the Boeing 777-200ER for the Bangkok\u2013Seoul\u2013Los-Angeles route. Although the previous A340 used for non-stop services was not subject to [[ETOPS]], the phasing in of the 777 with one-stop service (with the 330 minute rule) will be indefinite for years to come; the airline has no plans to pursue newer North America destinations (e.g., Houston, TX, USA) or purchase the [[Boeing 747-8]] for trans-Pacific routes since [https://www.247customerservicenumber.com/airlines/thai-airways-reservation-number/ Thai Airways] is operating the [[Airbus A380]].\n\nIn 2006, THAI moved its hub operations to the new Bangkok [[Suvarnabhumi Airport]]. Coinciding with the arrival of new aircraft during the mid-2000s, as well as its new hub airport in Bangkok, the airline launched a brand renewal by introducing a new aircraft livery, new aircraft seating, and revamped ground and air services.\n\nThe 2000s (decade) also saw Thai expanding its route network beyond its Bangkok hub. The airline launched non-stop flights from [[Phuket Province|Phuket]] to [[Narita International Airport|Tokyo\u2013Narita]], [[Incheon International Airport|Seoul\u2013Incheon]] and [[Hong Kong International Airport|Hong Kong]].\n\nDuring the late-2000s, Thai's aggressive growth was hampered by a combination of internal and external factors, including a spike in fuel prices, domestic political conflict in Thailand, and the [[Late-2000s recession|global economic crisis of the late-2000s]]. In 2008, after achieving profitability for the previous 40 years, THAI recorded a loss for the first time in its history of around 21 billion baht (US$675 million).

Thai has since placed orders for a number of aircraft, including the Boeing 787 and Airbus A350, and it has also launched a refurbishment of its Boeing 747 and 777 cabins. Mindful of rising fuel costs, the airline has now phased-out the most inefficient aircraft, including its Airbus A340-500s. The airline took delivery of its first Airbus A380 aircraft in the second half of 2012, intending to eventually deploy the aircraft on its core European routes.\n\nTHAI has also resumed its network expansion with the resumption of flights to [[Brussels]], in addition to a new non-stop flight from [[Stockholm]] and [[Copenhagen]] to [[Phuket Province|Phuket]]. At the same time, the Greek debt crisis caused Thai to suspend its services to [[Athens]].\n\nAs part of THAI's broader growth strategy in the region, THAI launched a regional carrier with light-premium services, [[Thai Smile]] which operates the narrow-bodied Airbus A320-200 on regional and domestic routes. The new airline initiated commercial operations in July 2012, after its first A320s were received.\n\nThai expects to be the first carrier in Asia to fly commercial flights using biofuels.

The purpose of the joint venture was to create an international wing for the domestic carrier Thai Airways Company. SAS also provided operational, managerial, and marketing expertise, with training assistance aimed at building a fully independent national airline within the shortest possible time.

The airline later converted existing one-stop service (via Tokyo) to Los Angeles into non-stop services using the same aircraft type. Citing very high fuel costs, Thai discontinued the New York service in July 2008, even though the airline had been able to fill 80 per cent of the seats. The service to Los Angeles was again reverted to one-stop service via Seoul on 1 May 2012, leaving the airline without a non-stop service between Thailand and North America. The A340s used have been phased out using the Boeing 777-200ER for the Bangkok\u2013Seoul\u2013Los-Angeles route. Although the previous A340 used for non-stop services was not subject to [[ETOPS]], the phasing in of the 777 with one-stop service (with the 330 minute rule) will be indefinite for years to come; the airline has no plans to pursue newer North America destinations (e.g., Houston, TX, USA) or purchase the [[Boeing 747-8]] for trans-Pacific routes since [https://www.247customerservicenumber.com/airlines/thai-airways-reservation-number/ Thai Airways] is operating the [[Airbus A380]].\n\nIn 2006, THAI moved its hub operations to the new Bangkok [[Suvarnabhumi Airport]]. Coinciding with the arrival of new aircraft during the mid-2000s, as well as its new hub airport in Bangkok, the airline launched a brand renewal by introducing a new aircraft livery, new aircraft seating, and revamped ground and air services.\n\nThe 2000s (decade) also saw Thai expanding its route network beyond its Bangkok hub. The airline launched non-stop flights from [[Phuket Province|Phuket]] to [[Narita International Airport|Tokyo\u2013Narita]], [[Incheon International Airport|Seoul\u2013Incheon]] and [[Hong Kong International Airport|Hong Kong]].\n\nDuring the late-2000s, Thai's aggressive growth was hampered by a combination of internal and external factors, including a spike in fuel prices, domestic political conflict in Thailand, and the [[Late-2000s recession|global economic crisis of the late-2000s]]. In 2008, after achieving profitability for the previous 40 years, THAI recorded a loss for the first time in its history of around 21 billion baht (US$675 million).

Thai has since placed orders for a number of aircraft, including the Boeing 787 and Airbus A350, and it has also launched a refurbishment of its Boeing 747 and 777 cabins. Mindful of rising fuel costs, the airline has now phased-out the most inefficient aircraft, including its Airbus A340-500s. The airline took delivery of its first Airbus A380 aircraft in the second half of 2012, intending to eventually deploy the aircraft on its core European routes.\n\nTHAI has also resumed its network expansion with the resumption of flights to [[Brussels]], in addition to a new non-stop flight from [[Stockholm]] and [[Copenhagen]] to [[Phuket Province|Phuket]]. At the same time, the Greek debt crisis caused Thai to suspend its services to [[Athens]].\n\nAs part of THAI's broader growth strategy in the region, THAI launched a regional carrier with light-premium services, [[Thai Smile]] which operates the narrow-bodied Airbus A320-200 on regional and domestic routes. The new airline initiated commercial operations in July 2012, after its first A320s were received.\n\nThai expects to be the first carrier in Asia to fly commercial flights using biofuels. The carrier launched the initiative with experimental flights in December 2011 as part of its Corporate Social Responsibility program, otherwise known as \"Travel Green\". Thaihopes to stimulate sustained biofuel production in Thailand by working with Thai government agencies and regional corporate partners, such as [[PTT Public Company Limited]]. The effort aims to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in regional air travel as well as position Thailand to be the \"bio hub\" of Asia.<ref name=\"Biofuels CSR Initiative\">{{cite web|url=http://www.etravelblackboard.com/article/126892/thai-launches-biofuels-flight-and-first-biofuels-passenger-flight-in-asia-through-travel-green-initiative |title= THAI Launches Biofuels Flight |publisher=eTravel Blackboard |accessdate=2011-12-27}}</ref>\n\nAll Thai airlines are presently (April 2015) under safety review following a negative audit from the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO).
