Macdonald also provided funds for the initial expenses of equipment, as well as an annual endowment for their maintenance. At this time, the School had two architecture studios which occupied two rooms in the northern half of the top floor of the old Macdonald Engineering Building. The School offered a four-year course to prepare students for professional accreditation, and as it remains today, the first year was preparatory, with all courses taken jointly by architecture and engineering students. The first graduating class was composed of only three students,{{NoteTag|The first graduating class was composed of George Taylor Hyde, Norman M.

Macdonald also provided funds for the initial expenses of equipment, as well as an annual endowment for their maintenance. At this time, the School had two architecture studios which occupied two rooms in the northern half of the top floor of the old Macdonald Engineering Building. The School offered a four-year course to prepare students for professional accreditation, and as it remains today, the first year was preparatory, with all courses taken jointly by architecture and engineering students. The first graduating class was composed of only three students,{{NoteTag|The first graduating class was composed of George Taylor Hyde, Norman M. McLeod and Frank Peder.<ref name=McGillBeginning />}} and Professor Capper gave all lectures in architecture, while Henry F. Armstrong, the only other full-time professor, taught art classes and modelling.<ref name=McGillBeginning />\n\n[[File:McDonald Engineering Building, McGill University, Montreal, QC, about 1895.jpg|thumb|left|upright|200px|The old [[McGill University Faculty of Engineering#Buildings & Laboratories|Macdonald Engineering Building]], the School of Architecture's original home.]]\nIn 1903, Capper returned to England to establish the School of Architecture at [[Victoria University of Manchester]], which was the fourth university architecture school to be established in the British Commonwealth, after [[University of Toronto]] (1890), [[University of Liverpool]] (1894) and McGill (1896).<ref name=McGillBeginning /> The second director of the School, [[Percy Nobbs]], arrived at McGill in 1903 to only two students.

By 1906, he was teaching six classes, so he hired three new staff to assist him, including his former colleague [[Cecil Burgess]]. Nobbs believed students should be exposed to architecture in practice, and one year after his arrival in Montreal, he designed the McGill Union (today the [[McCord Museum]]) across from McGill's [[Roddick Gates]]. After the Macdonald Engineering Building was damaged by fire in 1907,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cac.mcgill.ca/campus/buildings/Macdonald_Engineering.html|title=Macdonald Engineering, the Workman Wing, & the Electrical Wing|publisher=Canadian Architecture Collection|accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref> Nobbs designed the new building in its place, and the School of Architecture moved to its ground floor.

Mathuram]]\n\nWhen N. S. Krishnan was in prison for the [[Lakshmikanthan murder case]], his wife and comedian T. A. Mathuram started a drama troupe called ''N. S. K Nataka Sabha''. The troupe mainly staged plays written by and starring S. V. Sahasranamam. ''Paithiyakaran'' (lit. The mad man) was one of those plays. When Krishnan was first sentenced to jail, Mathuram took a break from her acting career. Later she came out her self-imposed exile to generate revenues for financing her husband's appeal to the privy council. With Mathuram in the lead, ''Paithiyakaran'' was a hit in Chennai. It was based on [[V. Shantaram]]'s 1937 film'' [[Duniya Na Mane]]''. Mathuram converted the troupe into a film production company and made a film based on the play. The film advocated reformist social policies like widow remarriage.  It was directed by the director duo of P. Krishnan and S. Panju. While the film was in production, Krishnan was acquitted in the murder case and was released from prison. A new role was written for him in the film. Mathuram played dual roles as the heroine and as Krishnan's comedic foil.

Mathuram]]\n\nWhen N. S. Krishnan was in prison for the [[Lakshmikanthan murder case]], his wife and comedian T. A. Mathuram started a drama troupe called ''N. S. K Nataka Sabha''. The troupe mainly staged plays written by and starring S. V. Sahasranamam. ''Paithiyakaran'' (lit. The mad man) was one of those plays. When Krishnan was first sentenced to jail, Mathuram took a break from her acting career. Later she came out her self-imposed exile to generate revenues for financing her husband's appeal to the privy council. With Mathuram in the lead, ''Paithiyakaran'' was a hit in Chennai. It was based on [[V. Shantaram]]'s 1937 film'' [[Duniya Na Mane]]''. Mathuram converted the troupe into a film production company and made a film based on the play. The film advocated reformist social policies like widow remarriage.  It was directed by the director duo of P. Krishnan and S. Panju. While the film was in production, Krishnan was acquitted in the murder case and was released from prison. A new role was written for him in the film. Mathuram played dual roles as the heroine and as Krishnan's comedic foil. Krishnan made fun of his stint in prison through the song ''jailukku poi vantha'' in which he described in prison life, his fellow inmates and the types of prisoners he met.

It was revived in 1985 and filled the gap between the [[Morgan 4/4|4/4]] and the [[Morgan Plus 8|Plus 8]] until 2000. It was again revived in 2005.\n\n==History==\nAfter World War II Morgan re-introduced their 4/4 model fitted with a 1267&nbsp;cc [[Standard Motor Company|Standard]] engine. This continued in production until it was replaced by the larger Plus 4 announced at the 1950 [[Motor Show (UK)|Earl's Court Motor Show]].\n\nThe Plus 4 at its introduction was fitted with a 2088&nbsp;cc [[Standard Vanguard]] engine installed on a strengthened 4/4 chassis with a wheelbase lengthened by {{convert|4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}. Hydraulic brakes, at first all drum, were fitted for the first time on a Morgan.\n\nIn 1953 a higher performance version was announced with the 1991&nbsp;cc [[Straight-4|I4]] engine as used in the [[Triumph TR2]] (a development of the Vanguard motor). The radiator grille was now surrounded by a cowl that blended into the bonnet. Front disc brakes became an option in 1959 and were standardised in 1960. From 1955 the 1991 cc [[Triumph TR3]] engine was used and from 1962 the engine was the [[Triumph TR4]] unit, which increased displacement to 2138&nbsp;cc.\n\nIn 1955 the less powerful 4/4 model re-appeared in phase II form. The {{convert|96|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase of the Plus 4 was adopted by the 4/4 when it reappeared, after which the two models were for most purposes the same length and width.\n\nBody styles available were a 2-seat sports, 4 seat sports and more luxurious 2 or 4 seat drophead coup\u00e9 (and a 4 seat coup\u00e9 1954\u20131956 only). In 1963 a fibreglass bodied coupe [[Morgan +4+]] was announced, but only 26 were built.\n\nThe bonnet of the Triumph-engined Plus 4 fitted so closely to the engine that there was no room for an air filter.\n\nThe then Swiss Morgan Importer, Rolf Wehrlin in Aesch/BL, developed a coup\u00e9 version of the Morgan +4.

Prior to this, Rustin, in New York City, conceived the idea of initiating such an effort and first sought [[Charles Kenzie Steele|C. K. Steele]] to make the call and take the lead role. Steele declined, but told Rustin he would be glad to work right beside him if he sought King in Montgomery for the role. Their goal was to form an organization to coordinate and support [[Nonviolence|nonviolent]] direct action as a method of desegregating bus systems across the [[Southern United States|South]]. In addition to King, Rustin, Baker, and Steele, [[Fred Shuttlesworth]] of Birmingham, [[Joseph Lowery]] of Mobile, and [[Ralph Abernathy]] of Montgomery, all played key roles in this meeting.<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Branch\n  | first = Taylor\n  | title = Parting the Waters\n  | url = https://archive.org/details/partingwatersame00bran_0\n  | url-access = registration\n  | publisher = Simon & Schuster\n  | year = 1988}}</ref>\n\nOn February 15, a follow-up meeting was held in New Orleans. Out of these two meetings came a new organization with King as its president. Initially called the \"Negro Leaders Conference on Nonviolent Integration,\" then \"Southern Negro Leaders Conference,\" the group eventually chose \"Southern Christian Leadership Conference\" (SCLC) as its name, and expanded its focus beyond buses to ending all forms of segregation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis57.htm|title=Veterans of the Civil Rights Movement -- History & Timeline, 1957|website=www.crmvet.org|access-date=2017-04-14}}</ref> A small office was established in the Prince Hall Masonic Temple Building on Auburn Avenue in Atlanta<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sweetauburn.us/princehall.htm|title=Sweet Auburn Avenue: The Buildings Tell Their Story|website=sweetauburn.us|access-date=2019-05-31}}</ref> with [[Ella Baker]] as SCLC's first\u2014and for a long time only\u2014staff member.<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Garrow\n  | first = David\n  | title = Bearing the Cross\n  | url = https://archive.org/details/bearingcross00davi\n  | url-access = registration\n  | publisher = Morrow\n  | year = 1986}}</ref>\n\nSCLC was governed by an elected Board, and established as an organization of affiliates, most of which were either individual churches or community organizations such as the [[Montgomery Improvement Association]] and the [[Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights]] (ACMHR). This organizational form differed from the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) and the [[Congress of Racial Equality]] (CORE) who recruited individuals and formed them into local chapters.\n\nThe organization also drew inspiration from the crusades of evangelist [[Billy Graham]], who befriended King after he appeared at a Graham crusade in New York City in 1957. Despite tactical differences, which arose from Graham's willingness to continue affiliating himself with segregationists, the SCLC and the [[Billy Graham Evangelistic Association]] had similar ambitions and Graham would privately advise the SCLC.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WBKaYVni9Z8C&pg=PA92|title=Billy Graham and the Rise of the Republican South|page=92|first=Steven P. |last=Miller|year=2009|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-8122-4151-8|accessdate=April 8, 2015}}</ref>\n\nDuring its early years, SCLC struggled to gain footholds in black churches and communities across the South. Social activism in favor of racial equality faced fierce repression from police, [[White Citizens' Council]] and the [[Ku Klux Klan]]. Only a few churches had the courage to defy the white-dominated status-quo by affiliating with SCLC, and those that did risked economic retaliation against pastors and other church leaders, arson, and bombings.\n\nSCLC's advocacy of boycotts and other forms of nonviolent protest was controversial among both whites and blacks. Many black community leaders believed that segregation should be challenged in the courts and that direct action excited white resistance, hostility, and violence. Traditionally, leadership in black communities came from the educated elite\u2014ministers, professionals, teachers, etc.\u2014who spoke for and on behalf of the laborers, maids, farm-hands, and [[working poor]] who made up the bulk of the black population. Many of these traditional leaders were uneasy at involving ordinary blacks in mass activity such as boycotts and marches.\n\nSCLC's belief that churches should be involved in political activism against social ills was also deeply controversial. Many ministers and religious leaders\u2014both black and white\u2014thought that the role of the church was to focus on the spiritual needs of the congregation and perform charitable works to aid the needy. To some of them, the social-political activity of King and SCLC amounted to dangerous radicalism which they strongly opposed.\n\nSCLC and King were also sometimes criticized for lack of militancy by younger activists in groups such as [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC) and CORE who were participating in [[sit-in]]s and [[Freedom ride|Freedom Rides]].\n\n===Citizenship Schools===\nOriginally started in 1954 by [[Esau Jenkins]] and [[Septima Poinsette Clark|Septima Clark]] on the [[Sea Islands]] off the coast of [[South Carolina]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], the Citizenship Schools focused on teaching adults to read so they could pass the voter-registration [[literacy test]]s, fill out driver's license exams, use mail-order forms, and open checking accounts. Under the auspices of the Highlander Folk School (now [[Highlander Research and Education Center]]) the program was expanded across the South. The [[Johns Island, South Carolina|Johns Island]] Citizenship School was housed at [[The Progressive Club]], listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2007.<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref><ref name=scdah>{{cite web|title=The Progressive Club, Charleston County (3377 River Rd., Johns Island)|url=http://www.nationalregister.sc.gov/charleston/S10817710183/index.htm|work=National Register Properties in South Carolina|publisher=South Carolina Department of Archives and History|accessdate=2014-08-01}}</ref>\n\nWhen the state of [[Tennessee]] revoked Highlander's charter and confiscated its land and property in 1961, SCLC rescued the citizenship school program and added Septima Clark, Bernice Robinson, and [[Andrew Young]] to its staff. Under the innocuous cover of adult-literacy classes, the schools secretly taught democracy and civil rights, community leadership and organizing, practical politicals, and the strategies and tactics of resistance and struggle, and in so doing built the human foundations of the mass community struggles to come.\n\nEventually, close to 69,000 teachers, most of them unpaid volunteers and many with little formal education, taught Citizenship Schools throughout the South.<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Payne\n  | first = Charles\n  | title = I've Got the Light of Freedom: The Organizing Tradition and the Mississippi Freedom Struggle\n  | url = https://archive.org/details/ivegotlightoffre00payn\n  | url-access = registration\n  | publisher = University of California Press\n  | year = 1995}}</ref> Many of the [[Civil Rights Movement]]'s adult leaders such as [[Fannie Lou Hamer]] and [[Victoria Gray Adams|Victoria Gray]], and hundreds of other local leaders in black communities across the South attended and taught citizenship schools.<ref>[http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis54.htm#1954ccs Citizenship Schools] ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans</ref>\n\n=== Albany Movement ===\n{{Main|Albany Movement}}\nIn 1961 and 1962, SCLC joined SNCC in the [[Albany Movement]], a broad protest against segregation in [[Albany, Georgia]]. It is generally considered the organization's first major nonviolent campaign. At the time, it was considered by many to be unsuccessful: despite large demonstrations and many arrests, few changes were won, and the protests drew little national attention. Yet, despite the lack of immediate gains, much of the success of the subsequent Birmingham Campaign can be attributed to lessons learned in Albany.<ref>[http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis61.htm#1961albany Albany GA, Movement] ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans</ref>\n\n=== Birmingham campaign ===\n{{Main|Birmingham campaign}}\nBy contrast, the 1963 SCLC [[Birmingham campaign|campaign]] in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], was an unqualified success. The campaign focused on a single goal\u2014the desegregation of Birmingham's downtown merchants\u2014rather than total desegregation, as in Albany. The brutal response of local police, led by Public Safety Commissioner [[Bull Connor|\"Bull\" Connor]], stood in stark contrast to the nonviolent civil disobedience of the activists.\n\nAfter his arrest in April, King wrote the \"[[Letter from Birmingham Jail]]\" in response to a group of clergy who had criticized the Birmingham campaign, writing that it was \"directed and led in part by outsiders\" and that the demonstrations were \"unwise and untimely.\"<ref>{{cite journal |author=C.C.J.

We have some eighty-five affiliated organizations across the South, and one of them is the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights. ... Several months ago the affiliate here in Birmingham asked us to be on call to engage in a nonviolent direct-action program if such were deemed necessary. We readily consented, and when the hour came we lived up to our promise.

Frankly, I have yet to engage in a direct-action campaign that was \"well timed\" in the view of those who have not suffered unduly from the disease of segregation. For years now I have heard the word \"Wait!\" It rings in the ear of every Negro with piercing familiarity. This \"Wait\" has almost always meant \"Never.\" We must come to see, with one of our distinguished jurists, that \"justice too long delayed is justice denied.\" We have waited for more than 340 years for our constitutional and God-given rights.<ref name=Birmingham/>}}\n\nThe most dramatic moments of the Birmingham campaign came on May 2, when, under the direction and leadership of [[James Bevel]], who would soon officially become SCLC's Director of Direct Action and Director of Nonviolent Education, more than 1,000 Black children left school to join the demonstrations; hundreds were arrested. The following day, 2,500 more students joined and were met by [[Bull Connor]] with police dogs and high-pressure fire hoses. That evening, television news programs reported to the nation and the world scenes of fire hoses knocking down schoolchildren and dogs attacking individual demonstrators. Public outrage led the [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]] administration to intervene more forcefully and a settlement was announced on May 10, under which the downtown businesses would desegregate and eliminate discriminatory hiring practices, and the city would release the jailed protesters.\n\n=== March on Washington ===\n{{Main|March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom}}\n[[File:March on washington Aug 28 1963.jpg|thumb|[[Martin Luther King Jr.]] at the March on Washington]]\nAfter the Birmingham Campaign, SCLC called for massive protests in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington, DC]], to push for new civil rights legislation that would outlaw segregation nationwide. [[A. Philip Randolph]] and\n[[Bayard Rustin]] issued similar calls for a March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. On July 2, 1963, King, Randolph, and Rustin met with [[James Farmer|James Farmer Jr.]] of the [[Congress of Racial Equality]], [[John Lewis (Georgia politician)|John Lewis]] of [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee|SNCC]], [[Roy Wilkins]] of the NAACP, and [[Whitney Young]] of the [[Urban League]] to plan a united march on August 28.\n\nThe media and political establishment viewed the march with great fear and trepidation over the possibility that protesters would run riot in the streets of the capital. But despite their fears, the March on Washington was a huge success, with no violence, and an estimated number of participants ranging from 200,000 to 300,000. It was also a logistical triumph\u2014more than 2,000 buses, 21 special trains, 10 chartered aircraft, and uncounted autos converged on the city in the morning and departed without difficulty by nightfall.\n\nThe crowning moment of the march was King's famous \"[[I Have a Dream]]\" speech in which he articulated the hopes and aspirations of the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and rooted it in two cherished gospels\u2014the Old Testament and the unfulfilled promise of the American creed.<ref>[http://www.crmvet.org/tim/tim63b.htm#1963mow March on Washington for Jobs & Freedom] ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans</ref>\n\n===St. Augustine protests===\n{{Main|St. Augustine movement}}\nWhen civil rights activists protesting segregation in St. Augustine, Florida were met with arrests and Ku Klux Klan violence, the local SCLC affiliate appealed to King for assistance in the spring of 1964. SCLC sent staff to help organize and lead demonstrations and mobilized support for St. Augustine in the North. Hundreds were arrested on sit-ins and marches opposing segregation, so many that the jails were filled and the overflow prisoners had to be held in outdoor stockades. Among the northern supporters who endured arrest and incarceration were Mrs. Malcolm Peabody, the mother of the governor of Massachusetts and Mrs. John Burgess, wife of the Episcopal Bishop of Massachusetts.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060311100813/http://www.stanford.edu/group/King/about_king/encyclopedia/saint_augustine.htm St. Augustine Movement] King Research and Education Institute (Stanford Univ)</ref>\n\nNightly marches to the Old Slave Market were attacked by white mobs, and when blacks attempted to integrate \"white-only\" beaches they were assaulted by police who beat them with clubs. On June 11, King and other SCLC leaders were arrested for trying to lunch at the Monson Motel restaurant, and when an integrated group of young protesters tried to use the motel swimming pool the owner poured acid into the water.

Church (Selma, Alabama)|Brown Chapel]] on January 2, 1965 in defiance of the injunction. SCLC and SNCC organizers recruited and trained blacks to attempt to register to vote at the courthouse, where many of them were abused and arrested by [[Dallas County, Alabama|Dallas County]] Sheriff Jim Clark&nbsp;\u2014&nbsp;a staunch segregationist. Black voter applicants were subjected to economic retaliation by the [[White Citizens' Council]], and threatened with physical violence by the [[Ku Klux Klan]]. Officials used the discriminatory [[literacy test]]<ref>[http://www.crmvet.org/info/lithome.htm Are You \"Qualified\" to Vote? The Alabama \"Literacy Test\"] ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans</ref> to keep blacks off the voter rolls.\n\nNonviolent mass marches demanded the right to vote and the jails filled up with arrested protesters, many of them students. On February 1, King and Abernathy were arrested. Voter registration efforts and protest marches spread to the surrounding [[Black Belt (region of Alabama)|Black Belt]]  counties&nbsp;\u2014&nbsp;[[Perry County, Alabama|Perry]], [[Wilcox County, Alabama|Wilcox]], [[Marengo County, Alabama|Marengo]], [[Greene County, Alabama|Greene]], and [[Hale County, Alabama|Hale]].\nOn February 18, an Alabama State Trooper shot and killed [[Jimmie Lee Jackson]] during a voting rights protest in [[Marion, Alabama|Marion]], county seat of Perry County. In response, James Bevel, who was directing SCLC's Selma actions, called for [[Selma to Montgomery marches|a march from Selma to Montgomery]], and on March 7 close to 600 protesters attempted the march to present their grievances to Governor [[George Wallace|Wallace]]. Led by Reverend [[Hosea Williams]] of SCLC and [[John Lewis (Georgia politician)|John Lewis]] of SNCC, the marchers were attacked by State Troopers, deputy sheriffs, and mounted possemen who used tear-gas, horses, clubs, and bull whips to drive them back to Brown Chapel. News coverage of this brutal assault on nonviolent demonstrators protesting for the right to vote&nbsp;\u2014&nbsp;which became known as \"Bloody Sunday\"&nbsp;\u2014&nbsp;horrified the nation.<ref>{{Cite web\n |publisher   = King Research & Education Institute at Stanford University\n |title       = Selma to Montgomery March\n |url         = http://www.stanford.edu/group/King/about_king/encyclopedia/selma_montgomery.htm\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090122214150/http://www.stanford.edu/group/King/about_king/encyclopedia/selma_montgomery.htm\n |archivedate = January 22, 2009\n |df          = mdy-all\n}}</ref>\n\nKing, Bevel, [[Diane Nash]] and others called on clergy and people of conscience to support the black citizens of Selma. Thousands of religious leaders and ordinary Americans came to demand voting rights for all. One of them was [[James Reeb]], a white [[Unitarian Universalist]] minister, who was savagely beaten to death on the street by Klansmen who severely injured two other ministers in the same attack.\n\nAfter more protests, arrests, and legal maneuvering, Federal Judge [[Frank Minis Johnson|Frank M.

They formed the Grenada County Freedom Movement (GCFM) as an SCLC affiliate, and within days 1,300 blacks registered to vote.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.crmvet.org/info/grenada.htm|title=Veterans of the Civil Rights Movement -- Grenada Mississippi\u2014Chronology of a Movement|website=www.crmvet.org|access-date=2019-05-31}}</ref>\n \nThough the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]<ref name=cra64/> had outlawed segregation of public facilities, the law had not been applied in Grenada which still maintained rigid segregation. After black students were arrested for trying to sit downstairs in the \"white\" section of the movie theater, SCLC and the GCFM demanded that all forms of segregation be eliminated, and called for a boycott of white merchants. Over the summer, the number of protests increased and many demonstrators and SCLC organizers were arrested as police enforced the old [[Jim Crow]] social order. In July and August, large mobs of white segregationists mobilized by the [[Ku Klux Klan|KKK]] violently attacked nonviolent marchers and news reporters with rocks, bottles, baseball bats and steel pipes.\n\nWhen the new school year began in September, SCLC and the GCFM encouraged more than 450 black students to register at the formerly white schools under a court desegregation order. This was by far the largest school integration attempt in Mississippi since the ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' ruling in 1954. The all-white school board resisted fiercely, whites threatened black parents with economic retaliation if they did not withdraw their children, and by the first day of school the number of black children registered in the white schools had dropped to approximately 250. On the first day of class, September 12, a furious white mob organized by the Klan attacked the black children and their parents with clubs, chains, whips, and pipes as they walked to school, injuring many and hospitalizing several with broken bones. Police and Mississippi State Troopers made no effort to halt or deter the mob violence.<ref>{{cite web|title=Negroes Beaten in Grenada School Integration|url=http://digital.library.pitt.edu/u/ulsmanuscripts/pdf/31735061655571.pdf|work=New York Times|publisher=University of Pittsburgh|accessdate=10 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nOver the following days, white mobs continued to attack the black children until public pressure and a Federal court order finally forced Mississippi lawmen to intervene. By the end of the first week, many black parents had withdrawn their children from the white schools out of fear for their safety, but approximately 150 black students continued to attend, still the largest school integration in state history at that point in time.\n\nInside the schools, blacks were harassed by white teachers, threatened and attacked by white students, and many blacks were expelled on flimsy pretexts by school officials. By mid-October, the number of blacks attending the white schools had dropped to roughly 70. When school officials refused to meet with a delegation of black parents, black students began boycotting both the white and black schools in protest. Many children, parents, GCFM activists, and SCLC organizers were arrested for protesting the school situation. By the end of October, almost all of the 2600 black students in Grenada County were boycotting school. The boycott was not ended until early November when SCLC attorneys won a Federal court order that the school system treat everyone equal regardless of race and meet with black parents.\n\n===Jackson conference===\nIn 1966, [[Allen Johnson (activist)|Allen Johnson]] hosted the Tenth Annual Southern Christian Leadership Conference at the Masonic Temple in [[Jackson, Mississippi]].<ref name=king>{{cite web|title=Program from the SCLC's Tenth Annual Convention|url=http://www.thekingcenter.org/archive/document/program-sclcs-tenth-annual-convention#|publisher=The King Center|accessdate=7 September 2015}}</ref> The theme of the conference was human rights - the continuing struggle.<ref name=king/> Those in attendance, among others, included: [[Edward Kennedy]], [[James Bevel]], [[Martin Luther King]], [[Ralph Abernathy]], [[Curtis W.

Abernathy was replaced by [[Joseph Lowery]] who was SCLC president until 1997. In 1997, MLK\u2019s son, [[Martin Luther King III]], became the president of SCLC. In 2004, for less than a year, it was [[Fred Shuttlesworth]]. After him, the president was [[Charles Steele Jr.]], and in 2009, Howard W.

He was accused of failing to answer correspondence from the board and take up issues important to the organization.

At the same time, it was generally considered less radical than [[Congress of Racial Equality]] (CORE) or the youth-led [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC).\n\nTo a certain extent during the period 1960\u20131964, SCLC had a mentoring relationship with SNCC before SNCC began moving away from nonviolence and integration in the late 1960s. Over time, SCLC and SNCC took different strategic paths, with SCLC focusing on large-scale campaigns such as [[Birmingham campaign|Birmingham]] and [[Selma to Montgomery marches|Selma]] to win national legislation, and SNCC focusing on community-organizing to build political power on the local level. In many communities, there was tension between SCLC and SNCC because SCLC's base was the minister-led Black churches, and SNCC was trying to build rival community organizations led by the poor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.crmvet.org/|title=Civil Rights Movement Veterans - CORE, NAACP, SCLC, SNCC|website=www.crmvet.org|access-date=2019-05-31}}</ref> SCLC also had its own youth volunteer initiative, the [[SCOPE Project]] (Summer Community Organization on Political Education), which placed about 500 young people, mostly white students from nearly 100 colleges and universities, who registered about 49,000 voters in 120 counties in 6 southern states in 1965\u201366.<ref name=\"Tuck2003\">{{cite book|author= Stephen G.

SCLC, which is closely associated with its first president, [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], had a large role in the American [[civil rights movement]].<ref>{{Cite web\n  |last=King Research & Education Institute at Stanford Univ.\n  |title=Southern Christian Leadership Conference\n  |url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/King/about_king/encyclopedia/enc_SCLC.htm}}</ref>\n\n== Founding ==\nOn January 10, 1957, following the [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]] victory and consultations with [[Bayard Rustin]], [[Ella Baker]], and others, [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] invited about 60 black ministers and leaders to [[Ebenezer Baptist Church (Atlanta, Georgia)|Ebenezer Church]] in Atlanta. Prior to this, Rustin, in New York City, conceived the idea of initiating such an effort and first sought [[Charles Kenzie Steele|C. K. Steele]] to make the call and take the lead role. Steele declined, but told Rustin he would be glad to work right beside him if he sought King in Montgomery for the role. Their goal was to form an organization to coordinate and support [[Nonviolence|nonviolent]] direct action as a method of desegregating bus systems across the [[Southern United States|South]]. In addition to King, Rustin, Baker, and Steele, [[Fred Shuttlesworth]] of Birmingham, [[Joseph Lowery]] of Mobile, and [[Ralph Abernathy]] of Montgomery, all played key roles in this meeting.<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Branch\n  | first = Taylor\n  | title = Parting the Waters\n  | url = https://archive.org/details/partingwatersame00bran_0\n  | url-access = registration\n  | publisher = Simon & Schuster\n  | year = 1988}}</ref>\n\nOn February 15, a follow-up meeting was held in New Orleans. Out of these two meetings came a new organization with King as its president. Initially called the \"Negro Leaders Conference on Nonviolent Integration,\" then \"Southern Negro Leaders Conference,\" the group eventually chose \"Southern Christian Leadership Conference\" (SCLC) as its name, and expanded its focus beyond buses to ending all forms of segregation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis57.htm|title=Veterans of the Civil Rights Movement -- History & Timeline, 1957|website=www.crmvet.org|access-date=2017-04-14}}</ref> A small office was established in the Prince Hall Masonic Temple Building on Auburn Avenue in Atlanta<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sweetauburn.us/princehall.htm|title=Sweet Auburn Avenue: The Buildings Tell Their Story|website=sweetauburn.us|access-date=2019-05-31}}</ref> with [[Ella Baker]] as SCLC's first\u2014and for a long time only\u2014staff member.<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Garrow\n  | first = David\n  | title = Bearing the Cross\n  | url = https://archive.org/details/bearingcross00davi\n  | url-access = registration\n  | publisher = Morrow\n  | year = 1986}}</ref>\n\nSCLC was governed by an elected Board, and established as an organization of affiliates, most of which were either individual churches or community organizations such as the [[Montgomery Improvement Association]] and the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights (ACMHR). This organizational form differed from the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) and the [[Congress of Racial Equality]] (CORE) who recruited individuals and formed them into local chapters.\n\nThe organization also drew inspiration from the crusades of evangelist [[Billy Graham]], who befriended King after he appeared at a Graham crusade in New York City in 1957. Despite tactical differences, which arose from Graham's willingness to continue affiliating himself with segregationists, the SCLC and the [[Billy Graham Evangelistic Association]] had similar ambitions and Graham would privately advise the SCLC.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WBKaYVni9Z8C&pg=PA92|title=Billy Graham and the Rise of the Republican South|page=92|first=Steven P. |last=Miller|year=2009|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-8122-4151-8|accessdate=April 8, 2015}}</ref>\n\nDuring its early years, SCLC struggled to gain footholds in black churches and communities across the South. Social activism in favor of racial equality faced fierce repression from police, [[White Citizens' Council]] and the [[Ku Klux Klan]]. Only a few churches had the courage to defy the white-dominated status-quo by affiliating with SCLC, and those that did risked economic retaliation against pastors and other church leaders, arson, and bombings.\n\nSCLC's advocacy of boycotts and other forms of nonviolent protest was controversial among both whites and blacks. Many black community leaders believed that segregation should be challenged in the courts and that direct action excited white resistance, hostility, and violence. Traditionally, leadership in black communities came from the educated elite\u2014ministers, professionals, teachers, etc.\u2014who spoke for and on behalf of the laborers, maids, farm-hands, and [[working poor]] who made up the bulk of the black population. Many of these traditional leaders were uneasy at involving ordinary blacks in mass activity such as boycotts and marches.\n\nSCLC's belief that churches should be involved in political activism against social ills was also deeply controversial. Many ministers and religious leaders\u2014both black and white\u2014thought that the role of the church was to focus on the spiritual needs of the congregation and perform charitable works to aid the needy. To some of them, the social-political activity of King and SCLC amounted to dangerous radicalism which they strongly opposed.\n\nSCLC and King were also sometimes criticized for lack of militancy by younger activists in groups such as [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC) and CORE who were participating in [[sit-in]]s and [[Freedom ride|Freedom Rides]].\n\n===Citizenship Schools===\nOriginally started in 1954 by [[Esau Jenkins]] and [[Septima Poinsette Clark|Septima Clark]] on the [[Sea Islands]] off the coast of [[South Carolina]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], the Citizenship Schools focused on teaching adults to read so they could pass the voter-registration [[literacy test]]s, fill out driver's license exams, use mail-order forms, and open checking accounts. Under the auspices of the Highlander Folk School (now [[Highlander Research and Education Center]]) the program was expanded across the South. The [[Johns Island, South Carolina|Johns Island]] Citizenship School was housed at [[The Progressive Club]], listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2007.<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref><ref name=scdah>{{cite web|title=The Progressive Club, Charleston County (3377 River Rd., Johns Island)|url=http://www.nationalregister.sc.gov/charleston/S10817710183/index.htm|work=National Register Properties in South Carolina|publisher=South Carolina Department of Archives and History|accessdate=2014-08-01}}</ref>\n\nWhen the state of [[Tennessee]] revoked Highlander's charter and confiscated its land and property in 1961, SCLC rescued the citizenship school program and added Septima Clark, Bernice Robinson, and [[Andrew Young]] to its staff. Under the innocuous cover of adult-literacy classes, the schools secretly taught democracy and civil rights, community leadership and organizing, practical politicals, and the strategies and tactics of resistance and struggle, and in so doing built the human foundations of the mass community struggles to come.\n\nEventually, close to 69,000 teachers, most of them unpaid volunteers and many with little formal education, taught Citizenship Schools throughout the South.<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Payne\n  | first = Charles\n  | title = I've Got the Light of Freedom: The Organizing Tradition and the Mississippi Freedom Struggle\n  | url = https://archive.org/details/ivegotlightoffre00payn\n  | url-access = registration\n  | publisher = University of California Press\n  | year = 1995}}</ref> Many of the [[Civil Rights Movement]]'s adult leaders such as [[Fannie Lou Hamer]] and [[Victoria Gray Adams|Victoria Gray]], and hundreds of other local leaders in black communities across the South attended and taught citizenship schools.<ref>[http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis54.htm#1954ccs Citizenship Schools] ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans</ref>\n\n=== Albany Movement ===\n{{Main|Albany Movement}}\nIn 1961 and 1962, SCLC joined SNCC in the [[Albany Movement]], a broad protest against segregation in [[Albany, Georgia]]. It is generally considered the organization's first major nonviolent campaign. At the time, it was considered by many to be unsuccessful: despite large demonstrations and many arrests, few changes were won, and the protests drew little national attention. Yet, despite the lack of immediate gains, much of the success of the subsequent Birmingham Campaign can be attributed to lessons learned in Albany.<ref>[http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis61.htm#1961albany Albany GA, Movement] ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans</ref>\n\n=== Birmingham campaign ===\n{{Main|Birmingham campaign}}\nBy contrast, the 1963 SCLC [[Birmingham campaign|campaign]] in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], was an unqualified success. The campaign focused on a single goal\u2014the desegregation of Birmingham's downtown merchants\u2014rather than total desegregation, as in Albany. The brutal response of local police, led by Public Safety Commissioner [[Bull Connor|\"Bull\" Connor]], stood in stark contrast to the nonviolent civil disobedience of the activists.\n\nAfter his arrest in April, King wrote the \"[[Letter from Birmingham Jail]]\" in response to a group of clergy who had criticized the Birmingham campaign, writing that it was \"directed and led in part by outsiders\" and that the demonstrations were \"unwise and untimely.\"<ref>{{cite journal |author=C.C.J.

We have some eighty-five affiliated organizations across the South, and one of them is the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights. ... Several months ago the affiliate here in Birmingham asked us to be on call to engage in a nonviolent direct-action program if such were deemed necessary. We readily consented, and when the hour came we lived up to our promise. So I, along with several members of my staff, am here because I was invited here I am here because I have organizational ties here.<ref name=Birmingham>{{cite journal |author=Martin Luther King, Jr. |title=Letter from Birmingham Jail | version= |format=.PDF |publisher=Martin Luther King Jr. Papers Project |url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/King/popular_requests/frequentdocs/birmingham.pdf |date=April 16, 1963 |accessdate=February 12, 2008}}</ref>}}\n\nKing also addressed the question of \"timeliness\":\n\n{{quote|One of the basic points in your statement is that the action that I and my associates have taken in Birmingham is untimely. ... Frankly, I have yet to engage in a direct-action campaign that was \"well timed\" in the view of those who have not suffered unduly from the disease of segregation. For years now I have heard the word \"Wait!\" It rings in the ear of every Negro with piercing familiarity. This \"Wait\" has almost always meant \"Never.\" We must come to see, with one of our distinguished jurists, that \"justice too long delayed is justice denied.\" We have waited for more than 340 years for our constitutional and God-given rights.<ref name=Birmingham/>}}\n\nThe most dramatic moments of the Birmingham campaign came on May 2, when, under the direction and leadership of [[James Bevel]], who would soon officially become SCLC's Director of Direct Action and Director of Nonviolent Education, more than 1,000 Black children left school to join the demonstrations; hundreds were arrested. The following day, 2,500 more students joined and were met by [[Bull Connor]] with police dogs and high-pressure fire hoses. That evening, television news programs reported to the nation and the world scenes of fire hoses knocking down schoolchildren and dogs attacking individual demonstrators. Public outrage led the [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]] administration to intervene more forcefully and a settlement was announced on May 10, under which the downtown businesses would desegregate and eliminate discriminatory hiring practices, and the city would release the jailed protesters.\n\n=== March on Washington ===\n{{Main|March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom}}\n[[File:March on washington Aug 28 1963.jpg|thumb|[[Martin Luther King Jr.]] at the March on Washington]]\nAfter the Birmingham Campaign, SCLC called for massive protests in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington, DC]], to push for new civil rights legislation that would outlaw segregation nationwide. [[A. Philip Randolph]] and\n[[Bayard Rustin]] issued similar calls for a March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. On July 2, 1963, King, Randolph, and Rustin met with [[James Farmer|James Farmer Jr.]] of the [[Congress of Racial Equality]], [[John Lewis (Georgia politician)|John Lewis]] of [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee|SNCC]], [[Roy Wilkins]] of the NAACP, and [[Whitney Young]] of the [[Urban League]] to plan a united march on August 28.\n\nThe media and political establishment viewed the march with great fear and trepidation over the possibility that protesters would run riot in the streets of the capital. But despite their fears, the March on Washington was a huge success, with no violence, and an estimated number of participants ranging from 200,000 to 300,000. It was also a logistical triumph\u2014more than 2,000 buses, 21 special trains, 10 chartered aircraft, and uncounted autos converged on the city in the morning and departed without difficulty by nightfall.\n\nThe crowning moment of the march was King's famous \"[[I Have a Dream]]\" speech in which he articulated the hopes and aspirations of the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and rooted it in two cherished gospels\u2014the Old Testament and the unfulfilled promise of the American creed.<ref>[http://www.crmvet.org/tim/tim63b.htm#1963mow March on Washington for Jobs & Freedom] ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans</ref>\n\n===St. Augustine protests===\n{{Main|St. Augustine movement}}\nWhen civil rights activists protesting segregation in St. Augustine, Florida were met with arrests and Ku Klux Klan violence, the local SCLC affiliate appealed to King for assistance in the spring of 1964. SCLC sent staff to help organize and lead demonstrations and mobilized support for St. Augustine in the North. Hundreds were arrested on sit-ins and marches opposing segregation, so many that the jails were filled and the overflow prisoners had to be held in outdoor stockades. Among the northern supporters who endured arrest and incarceration were Mrs. Malcolm Peabody, the mother of the governor of Massachusetts and Mrs. John Burgess, wife of the Episcopal Bishop of Massachusetts.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060311100813/http://www.stanford.edu/group/King/about_king/encyclopedia/saint_augustine.htm St. Augustine Movement] King Research and Education Institute (Stanford Univ)</ref>\n\nNightly marches to the Old Slave Market were attacked by white mobs, and when blacks attempted to integrate \"white-only\" beaches they were assaulted by police who beat them with clubs. On June 11, King and other SCLC leaders were arrested for trying to lunch at the Monson Motel restaurant, and when an integrated group of young protesters tried to use the motel swimming pool the owner poured acid into the water. TV and newspaper stories of the struggle for justice in St. Augustine helped build public support for the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]<ref name=\"cra64\">{{Cite web|url=https://finduslaw.com/civil-rights-act-1964-cra-title-vii-equal-employment-opportunities-42-us-code-chapter-21|title=Civil Rights Act of 1964 - CRA - Title VII - Equal Employment Opportunities - 42 US Code Chapter 21 {{!}} findUSlaw|website=finduslaw.com|access-date=2019-05-31}}</ref> that was then being debated in [[United States Congress|Congress]].<ref>[http://www.crmvet.org/info/staug.htm St. Augustine Movement 1963\u20131964] ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans</ref>\n\n===Selma Voting Rights Movement and the march to Montgomery===\n{{Main|Selma to Montgomery marches}}\n\nWhen voter registration and civil rights activity in [[Selma, Alabama]] were blocked by an illegal injunction,<ref>[http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis64.htm#1964selmainj The Selma Injunction] ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans</ref> the [[Dallas County Voters League]] (DCVL) asked SCLC for assistance. King, SCLC, and DCVL chose Selma as the site for a major campaign around voting rights that would demand national voting rights legislation in the same way that the [[Birmingham campaign|Birmingham]] and St. Augustine campaigns won passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]].<ref name=cra64/><ref>[http://www.crmvet.org/disc/selma.htm#ala65proj SCLC's \"Alabama Project\"] ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans</ref>\nIn cooperation with SNCC who had been organizing in Selma since early 1963, the Voting Rights Campaign commenced with a rally in [[Brown Chapel A.M.E. Church (Selma, Alabama)|Brown Chapel]] on January 2, 1965 in defiance of the injunction. SCLC and SNCC organizers recruited and trained blacks to attempt to register to vote at the courthouse, where many of them were abused and arrested by [[Dallas County, Alabama|Dallas County]] Sheriff Jim Clark&nbsp;\u2014&nbsp;a staunch segregationist. Black voter applicants were subjected to economic retaliation by the [[White Citizens' Council]], and threatened with physical violence by the [[Ku Klux Klan]]. Officials used the discriminatory [[literacy test]]<ref>[http://www.crmvet.org/info/lithome.htm Are You \"Qualified\" to Vote? The Alabama \"Literacy Test\"] ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans</ref> to keep blacks off the voter rolls.\n\nNonviolent mass marches demanded the right to vote and the jails filled up with arrested protesters, many of them students. On February 1, King and Abernathy were arrested. Voter registration efforts and protest marches spread to the surrounding [[Black Belt (region of Alabama)|Black Belt]]  counties&nbsp;\u2014&nbsp;[[Perry County, Alabama|Perry]], [[Wilcox County, Alabama|Wilcox]], [[Marengo County, Alabama|Marengo]], [[Greene County, Alabama|Greene]], and [[Hale County, Alabama|Hale]].\nOn February 18, an Alabama State Trooper shot and killed [[Jimmie Lee Jackson]] during a voting rights protest in [[Marion, Alabama|Marion]], county seat of Perry County. In response, James Bevel, who was directing SCLC's Selma actions, called for [[Selma to Montgomery marches|a march from Selma to Montgomery]], and on March 7 close to 600 protesters attempted the march to present their grievances to Governor [[George Wallace|Wallace]]. Led by Reverend [[Hosea Williams]] of SCLC and [[John Lewis (Georgia politician)|John Lewis]] of SNCC, the marchers were attacked by State Troopers, deputy sheriffs, and mounted possemen who used tear-gas, horses, clubs, and bull whips to drive them back to Brown Chapel. News coverage of this brutal assault on nonviolent demonstrators protesting for the right to vote&nbsp;\u2014&nbsp;which became known as \"Bloody Sunday\"&nbsp;\u2014&nbsp;horrified the nation.<ref>{{Cite web\n |publisher   = King Research & Education Institute at Stanford University\n |title       = Selma to Montgomery March\n |url         = http://www.stanford.edu/group/King/about_king/encyclopedia/selma_montgomery.htm\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090122214150/http://www.stanford.edu/group/King/about_king/encyclopedia/selma_montgomery.htm\n |archivedate = January 22, 2009\n |df          = mdy-all\n}}</ref>\n\nKing, Bevel, [[Diane Nash]] and others called on clergy and people of conscience to support the black citizens of Selma. Thousands of religious leaders and ordinary Americans came to demand voting rights for all. One of them was [[James Reeb]], a white [[Unitarian Universalist]] minister, who was savagely beaten to death on the street by Klansmen who severely injured two other ministers in the same attack.\n\nAfter more protests, arrests, and legal maneuvering, Federal Judge [[Frank Minis Johnson|Frank M.

On the 25th, an estimated 25,000<ref>{{cite book\n  |last=Garrow\n  |first=David\n  |title=Bearing the Cross\n  |publisher=Morrow\n  |year=1986\n  |isbn=0-688-04794-7\n  |url=https://archive.org/details/bearingcross00davi\n  }}</ref> protesters marched to the steps of the Alabama capitol in support of voting rights where King spoke.<ref>{{Cite web\n  |last=King Research & Education Institute at Stanford University\n  |title=Our God Is Marching On!\n  |url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/King/publications/speeches/Our_God_is_marching_on.html}}</ref> Within five months,  Congress and President [[Lyndon Johnson]] responded to the enormous public pressure generated by the Selma Voting Rights Movement by enacting into law the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]].\n\n===Grenada Freedom Movement===\nWhen the [[March Against Fear|Meredith Mississippi March Against Fear]] passed through [[Grenada, Mississippi]] on June 15, 1966, it sparked months of civil rights activity on the part of Grenada blacks. They formed the Grenada County Freedom Movement (GCFM) as an SCLC affiliate, and within days 1,300 blacks registered to vote.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.crmvet.org/info/grenada.htm|title=Veterans of the Civil Rights Movement -- Grenada Mississippi\u2014Chronology of a Movement|website=www.crmvet.org|access-date=2019-05-31}}</ref>\n \nThough the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]<ref name=cra64/> had outlawed segregation of public facilities, the law had not been applied in Grenada which still maintained rigid segregation. After black students were arrested for trying to sit downstairs in the \"white\" section of the movie theater, SCLC and the GCFM demanded that all forms of segregation be eliminated, and called for a boycott of white merchants. Over the summer, the number of protests increased and many demonstrators and SCLC organizers were arrested as police enforced the old [[Jim Crow]] social order. In July and August, large mobs of white segregationists mobilized by the [[Ku Klux Klan|KKK]] violently attacked nonviolent marchers and news reporters with rocks, bottles, baseball bats and steel pipes.\n\nWhen the new school year began in September, SCLC and the GCFM encouraged more than 450 black students to register at the formerly white schools under a court desegregation order. This was by far the largest school integration attempt in Mississippi since the ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' ruling in 1954. The all-white school board resisted fiercely, whites threatened black parents with economic retaliation if they did not withdraw their children, and by the first day of school the number of black children registered in the white schools had dropped to approximately 250. On the first day of class, September 12, a furious white mob organized by the Klan attacked the black children and their parents with clubs, chains, whips, and pipes as they walked to school, injuring many and hospitalizing several with broken bones. Police and Mississippi State Troopers made no effort to halt or deter the mob violence.<ref>{{cite web|title=Negroes Beaten in Grenada School Integration|url=http://digital.library.pitt.edu/u/ulsmanuscripts/pdf/31735061655571.pdf|work=New York Times|publisher=University of Pittsburgh|accessdate=10 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nOver the following days, white mobs continued to attack the black children until public pressure and a Federal court order finally forced Mississippi lawmen to intervene. By the end of the first week, many black parents had withdrawn their children from the white schools out of fear for their safety, but approximately 150 black students continued to attend, still the largest school integration in state history at that point in time.\n\nInside the schools, blacks were harassed by white teachers, threatened and attacked by white students, and many blacks were expelled on flimsy pretexts by school officials. By mid-October, the number of blacks attending the white schools had dropped to roughly 70. When school officials refused to meet with a delegation of black parents, black students began boycotting both the white and black schools in protest. Many children, parents, GCFM activists, and SCLC organizers were arrested for protesting the school situation. By the end of October, almost all of the 2600 black students in Grenada County were boycotting school. The boycott was not ended until early November when SCLC attorneys won a Federal court order that the school system treat everyone equal regardless of race and meet with black parents.\n\n===Jackson conference===\nIn 1966, [[Allen Johnson (activist)|Allen Johnson]] hosted the Tenth Annual Southern Christian Leadership Conference at the Masonic Temple in [[Jackson, Mississippi]].<ref name=king>{{cite web|title=Program from the SCLC's Tenth Annual Convention|url=http://www.thekingcenter.org/archive/document/program-sclcs-tenth-annual-convention#|publisher=The King Center|accessdate=7 September 2015}}</ref> The theme of the conference was human rights - the continuing struggle.<ref name=king/> Those in attendance, among others, included: [[Edward Kennedy]], [[James Bevel]], [[Martin Luther King]], [[Ralph Abernathy]], [[Curtis W.

Abernathy was replaced by [[Joseph Lowery]] who was SCLC president until 1997. In 1997, MLK\u2019s son, [[Martin Luther King III]], became the president of SCLC. In 2004, for less than a year, it was [[Fred Shuttlesworth]]. After him, the president was [[Charles Steele Jr.]], and in 2009, Howard W.

At the same time, it was generally considered less radical than [[Congress of Racial Equality]] (CORE) or the youth-led [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC).\n\nTo a certain extent during the period 1960\u20131964, SCLC had a mentoring relationship with SNCC before SNCC began moving away from nonviolence and integration in the late 1960s. Over time, SCLC and SNCC took different strategic paths, with SCLC focusing on large-scale campaigns such as [[Birmingham campaign|Birmingham]] and [[Selma to Montgomery marches|Selma]] to win national legislation, and SNCC focusing on community-organizing to build political power on the local level. In many communities, there was tension between SCLC and SNCC because SCLC's base was the minister-led Black churches, and SNCC was trying to build rival community organizations led by the poor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.crmvet.org/|title=Civil Rights Movement Veterans - CORE, NAACP, SCLC, SNCC|website=www.crmvet.org|access-date=2019-05-31}}</ref> SCLC also had its own youth volunteer initiative, the [[SCOPE Project]] (Summer Community Organization on Political Education), which placed about 500 young people, mostly white students from nearly 100 colleges and universities, who registered about 49,000 voters in 120 counties in 6 southern states in 1965\u201366.<ref name=\"Tuck2003\">{{cite book|author= Stephen G.

(This is the [[one-point compactification]] of the line.)|alt=]]\n\nAs ''x'' varies, the point (cos&nbsp;''x'',&nbsp;sin&nbsp;''x'') winds repeatedly around the [[unit circle]] centered at&nbsp;(0,&nbsp;0).  The point\n\n:<math>\\left(\\frac{1-t^2}{1+t^2}, \\frac{2t}{1+t^2}\\right)</math>\n\ngoes only once around the circle as ''t'' goes from &minus;&infin; to&nbsp;+&infin;, and never reaches the point&nbsp;(&minus;1,&nbsp;0), which is approached as a limit as ''t'' approaches&nbsp;\u00b1&infin;.  As ''t'' goes from &minus;&infin; to &minus;1, the point determined by ''t'' goes through the part of the circle in the third quadrant, from (&minus;1,&nbsp;0) to&nbsp;(0,&nbsp;&minus;1).  As ''t'' goes from &minus;1 to&nbsp;0, the point follows the part of the circle in the fourth quadrant from (0,&nbsp;&minus;1) to&nbsp;(1,&nbsp;0).  As ''t'' goes from 0 to 1, the point follows the part of the circle in the first quadrant from (1,&nbsp;0) to&nbsp;(0,&nbsp;1).  Finally, as ''t'' goes from 1 to&nbsp;+&infin;, the point follows the part of the circle in the second quadrant from (0,&nbsp;1) to&nbsp;(&minus;1,&nbsp;0).\n\nHere is another geometric point of view.  Draw the unit circle, and let ''P'' be the point {{nowrap|(&minus;1, 0)}}.  A line through ''P'' (except the vertical line) is determined by its slope.  Furthermore, each of the lines (except the vertical line) intersects the unit circle in exactly two points, one of which is ''P''.  This determines a function from points on the unit circle to slopes.  The trigonometric functions determine a function from angles to points on the unit circle, and by combining these two functions we have a function from angles to slopes.\n\n==Gallery==\n[[File:Weierstrass substitution.png|thumb|400px|center|The Weierstrass substitution relates an angle to the slope of a line.]]\n<br/>\n[[File:WeierstrassSubstitution.svg|thumb|400px|center|The Weierstrass substitution illustrated as [[stereographic projection]] of the circle.]]\n\n==Hyperbolic functions==\n\nAs with other properties shared between the trigonometric functions and the hyperbolic functions, it is possible to use [[Tangent half-angle formula#Hyperbolic identities|hyperbolic identities]] to construct a similar form of the substitution:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n& \\sinh x = \\frac{2t}{1 - t^2}, \\\\[6pt]\n& \\cosh x = \\frac{1 + t^2}{1 - t^2}, \\\\[6pt]\n& \\tanh x = \\frac{2t}{1 + t^2}, \\\\[6pt]\n& dx = \\frac{2}{1- t^2}\\,dt.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Mathematics}}\n*[[Rational curve]]\n*[[Stereographic projection]]\n*[[Tangent half-angle formula]]\n*[[Trigonometric substitution]]\n*[[Euler substitution]]\n\n== Notes and references ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/WeierstrassSubstitutionFormulas.html Weierstrass substitution formulas] at [[PlanetMath]]\n{{Integrals}}\n[[Category:Integral calculus]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Change of variable for integrals involving trigonometric functions}}\n{{calculus|expanded=integral}}\n\nIn [[integral calculus]], the '''Weierstrass substitution''' or '''tangent half-angle substitution''' is a method for evaluating integrals which converts a rational function involving sines and cosines of <math>\\theta</math> into an ordinary rational function of <math>t</math> by setting <math>t = \\tan (\\theta /2)</math>.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Stewart|first=James|title=Calculus: Early Transcendentals|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2012|isbn=978-0-538-49790-9|edition=7th|location=Belmont, CA, USA|pages=493}}</ref><ref>Weisstein, Eric W. \"[https://mathworld.wolfram.com/WeierstrassSubstitution.html Weierstrass Substitution].\" From ''MathWorld''--A Wolfram Web Resource.

Instead of +&infin; and &minus;&infin;, we have only one &infin;, at both ends of the real line.  That is often appropriate when dealing with rational functions and with trigonometric functions.  (This is the [[one-point compactification]] of the line.)|alt=]]\n\nAs ''x'' varies, the point (cos&nbsp;''x'',&nbsp;sin&nbsp;''x'') winds repeatedly around the [[unit circle]] centered at&nbsp;(0,&nbsp;0).  The point\n\n:<math>\\left(\\frac{1-t^2}{1+t^2}, \\frac{2t}{1+t^2}\\right)</math>\n\ngoes only once around the circle as ''t'' goes from &minus;&infin; to&nbsp;+&infin;, and never reaches the point&nbsp;(&minus;1,&nbsp;0), which is approached as a limit as ''t'' approaches&nbsp;\u00b1&infin;.  As ''t'' goes from &minus;&infin; to &minus;1, the point determined by ''t'' goes through the part of the circle in the third quadrant, from (&minus;1,&nbsp;0) to&nbsp;(0,&nbsp;&minus;1).  As ''t'' goes from &minus;1 to&nbsp;0, the point follows the part of the circle in the fourth quadrant from (0,&nbsp;&minus;1) to&nbsp;(1,&nbsp;0).  As ''t'' goes from 0 to 1, the point follows the part of the circle in the first quadrant from (1,&nbsp;0) to&nbsp;(0,&nbsp;1).  Finally, as ''t'' goes from 1 to&nbsp;+&infin;, the point follows the part of the circle in the second quadrant from (0,&nbsp;1) to&nbsp;(&minus;1,&nbsp;0).\n\nHere is another geometric point of view.  Draw the unit circle, and let ''P'' be the point {{nowrap|(&minus;1, 0)}}.  A line through ''P'' (except the vertical line) is determined by its slope.  Furthermore, each of the lines (except the vertical line) intersects the unit circle in exactly two points, one of which is ''P''.  This determines a function from points on the unit circle to slopes.  The trigonometric functions determine a function from angles to points on the unit circle, and by combining these two functions we have a function from angles to slopes.\n\n==Gallery==\n[[File:Weierstrass substitution.png|thumb|400px|center|The Weierstrass substitution relates an angle to the slope of a line.]]\n<br/>\n[[File:WeierstrassSubstitution.svg|thumb|400px|center|The Weierstrass substitution illustrated as [[stereographic projection]] of the circle.]]\n\n==Hyperbolic functions==\n\nAs with other properties shared between the trigonometric functions and the hyperbolic functions, it is possible to use [[Tangent half-angle formula#Hyperbolic identities|hyperbolic identities]] to construct a similar form of the substitution:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n& \\sinh x = \\frac{2t}{1 - t^2}, \\\\[6pt]\n& \\cosh x = \\frac{1 + t^2}{1 - t^2}, \\\\[6pt]\n& \\tanh x = \\frac{2t}{1 + t^2}, \\\\[6pt]\n& dx = \\frac{2}{1- t^2}\\,dt.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Mathematics}}\n*[[Rational curve]]\n*[[Stereographic projection]]\n*[[Tangent half-angle formula]]\n*[[Trigonometric substitution]]\n*[[Euler substitution]]\n\n== Notes and references ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/WeierstrassSubstitutionFormulas.html Weierstrass substitution formulas] at [[PlanetMath]]\n{{Integrals}}\n[[Category:Integral calculus]]\n", "name_user": "Nerd271", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eDerivation of the formulas", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weierstrass_substitution"}

Times change, and the modern day comes. Rajaram ([[Nassar (actor)|Nassar]]) is a very rich man who owns tea estates. He has Seetha ([[Saranya Mohan]]) as his dietitian and Sri Rama ([[Aravind Akash]]) as his cook. Both Rama and Seetha are in love. On the other hand, Rajaram's relatives (Thirupathi ([[M. S.

Seetha falls directly on the rock idol of Mareesan and gets his human form. At the same time, his anklet falls off and gets eaten by a fish. That fish is caught by fisherman Manickam ([[Nassar (actor)|Nassar]]), and Idumba gets his human form.
