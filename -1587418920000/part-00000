Someone who wins a Pyrrhic victory has also taken a heavy toll that negates any true sense of achievement or damages long-term progress.\n\n==Etymology==\n\n''Pyrrhic victory'' is named after King [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]] of [[Epirus (ancient state)|Epirus]], whose army suffered irreplaceable casualties in defeating the [[Roman Republic|Romans]] at the [[Battle of Heraclea]] in 280 BC and the [[Battle of Asculum]] in 279 BC, during the [[Pyrrhic War]]. After the latter battle, [[Plutarch]] relates in a report by [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus|Dionysius]]:\n\n{{quote|The armies separated; and, it is said, Pyrrhus replied to one that gave him joy of his victory that ''one other such victory would utterly undo him''. For he had lost a great part of the forces he brought with him, and almost all his particular friends and principal commanders; there were no others there to make recruits, and he found the confederates in Italy backward. On the other hand, as from a fountain continually flowing out of the city, the Roman camp was quickly and plentifully filled up with fresh men, not at all abating in courage for the loss they sustained, but even from their very anger gaining new force and resolution to go on with the war.|Plutarch, [[Parallel Lives|Life of Pyrrhus]]<ref>[[Plutarch]] (trans.

After the latter battle, [[Plutarch]] relates in a report by [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus|Dionysius]]:\n\n{{quote|The armies separated; and, it is said, Pyrrhus replied to one that gave him joy of his victory that ''one other such victory would utterly undo him''. For he had lost a great part of the forces he brought with him, and almost all his particular friends and principal commanders; there were no others there to make recruits, and he found the confederates in Italy backward. On the other hand, as from a fountain continually flowing out of the city, the Roman camp was quickly and plentifully filled up with fresh men, not at all abating in courage for the loss they sustained, but even from their very anger gaining new force and resolution to go on with the war.|Plutarch, [[Parallel Lives|Life of Pyrrhus]]<ref>[[Plutarch]] (trans.

Organization|IBO]] [[light heavyweight]] title from 2012 to 2013. He was based in [[Chicago]] for most of his career.\n\n==Professional career==\n\n=== Super middleweight ===\n\n==== Early career ====\nAndrzej began his career in boxing by joining the Warsaw boxing club [[Gwardia Warszawa]]. His trainers were Jacek Kucharczyk and [[Jerzy Rybicki]]. After some time he decided to transfer to another Warsaw boxing club, [[Legia Warszawa]], and this time he trained with [[Krzysztof Kosedowski]], Adam Kozlowski and Lukasz Landowski. But he didn't stay there for long and transferred back to his original club. This time he was working with Stanislaw Lakomiec with whom he won his biggest trophies. Finally as a senior he trained with [[Pawe\u0142 Skrzecz]] and Sebastian Skrzecz, and with them he ended his amateur career.\n\nHis professional career began in 2006 at [[Ostro\u0142\u0119ka]], where he won by majority decision against Czech fighter Miroslav Kubik. After this fight he got a chance to train and fight in the U.S. He currently resides in the U.S. with his family in Chicago and trains with Sam Colonna ([[Andrzej Golota]]\u2019s trainer). In 2009 he signed a contract with Dominic Pesoli's 8 Count Productions. That same year, Fonfara tested positive for anabolic steroids. His TKO win over Skyler Thompson was overturned, ending up in a No Contest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fightsaga.com/news/item/4041-Adonis-Stevenson-Next-opponent-is-likely-Andrzej-Fonfara |title=Adonis Stevenson: Next opponent is likely Andrzej Fonfara |website=Fightsaga.com |date=2014-01-17 |accessdate=2016-02-09}}</ref>\n\n=== Light heavyweight ===\nAt the beginning of 2010 he decided to move to [[Light Heavyweight|light heavyweight]] division which was better suited for his body. In 2010 he won a WBC Youth Championship, and in 2011 [[North American Boxing Organization|WBO NABO]] Title. On September 23, 2011, he won by TKO in second round against Jose Spearman in his home town of Chicago.\n\n====Fonfara vs. Johnson, Karpency ====\nFonfara fought 43 year old former world champion [[Glen Johnson (boxer)|Glen Johnson]]  (51-16-2, 36 KOs) on June 13, 2012, at Chicago's [[UIC Pavilion]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/glen-johnson-vs-fonfara-castillo-popoca-on-7-13-espn--52697|title=Glen Johnson vs Fonfara, Castillo-Popoca on 7/13, ESPN|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2017-12-29|language=en-us}}</ref> Fonfara defeated Johnson via a controversial unanimous decision with the three judges scoring the bout 99\u201391, 97-93 and 97\u201393. Johnson had some success early landing with power shots and jabs when in range, but Fonfara had the better stamina and speed and worked over Johnson, who was fading, for the final four rounds. Fonfara connected well from the distance with jabs, followed by right hands and only allowed Johnson a chance when he chose to fight in close. Johnson announced his retirement after the fight. It was the first time Fonfara had been beyond seven rounds.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/boxing/story/_/id/8165627/light-heavyweight-contender-andrzej-fonfara-defeats-43-year-old-glen-johnson-controversial-10-round-unanimous-decision|title=Fonfara beats 43-year-old Johnson by decision|access-date=2016-10-01}}</ref>\n\nFollowing his first major win against Johnson, Fonfara challenged former world title challenger [[Tommy Karpency]] (21-3-1 4 KOs) for the vacant [[List of IBO world champions|IBO light heavyweight]] title.
