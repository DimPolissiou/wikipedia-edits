Some time later Trussell and Ward became friends and Ward suggested to Trussell to turn his podcast into an animated series. According to Ward, Trussell had the ability to make 2 hours of a meditation conversation funny. Trussell says: \"He reached out to me and said he had an idea for how to animate my podcast, which was another big thrill for me.\"<ref name=\"Inverse\">{{cite web |last1=Kleinman |first1=Jake |title='Midnight Gospel' Was Seven Years In The Making.

In 2018, Ward approached to him again to show a rough concept taking a podcast conversation about drug addiction and playing it over an animatic of Trussell and his guest fighting off a zombie invasion.<ref name=\"Inverse\"/>\n\n===Writing and production===\nLater, this rough concept ended up being incorporated into the pilot of the series. The two took the concept of the series in pitching form to Mike Moon, head of adult animations at Netflix. In 2019, Netflix ordered eight episodes, which premiered on April 20th, 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/12/netflix-order-adult-animated-series-the-midnight-gospel-from-pendleton-ward-duncan-trussell-1202814276/|title=Netflix Orders Adult Animated Series \u2018The Midnight Gospel\u2019 From Pendleton Ward & Duncan Trussell|website=[[Deadline Hollywood|Deadline]]|first1=Denise|last1=Petski|accessdate=April 20, 2020|date=December 19, 2019}}</ref> After gaining the green light, the two gathered a team of comedians like [[Johnny Pemberton]], Brendon Walsh, [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]] and [[Emo Philips]] who were joined by occult scholar Jason Louv and white witch Maja D\u2019Aoust. The two assembled a team of approximately 190 people at Titmouse and started working on creating the episodes.<ref name=\"AnMag\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.animationmagazine.net/streaming/light-at-the-end-of-the-apocalypse-pen-ward-duncan-trussell-preach-the-midnight-gospel/|title=Light at the End of the Apocalypse: Pen Ward & Duncan Trussell Preach 'The Midnight Gospel'|website=Animation Magazine|first=Ramin|last=Zahed|date=April 16, 2020}}</ref> Mike Mayfield joined the project as supervising director and writer for all the episodes. The team behind the show is composed of Jesse Moynihan (art director), Antonio Canobbio (Chief Creative Officer for Titmouse), Mike Roush (animation director) and Joey Adams (storyboard supervisor). Mayfield said that the time needed to \"try something nine different ways before one little change would make it go from clunky to incredible.\"<ref name=\"AnMag\"/>\n\nDuring the beginning of production, they needed to know how much of the episodes will be story, to how much will be a podcast conversation, and they also need to choose which parts of the podcast to use in the show. According to Trussell, the parts of the podcast chosen for the series are about highlighting revelatory moments from his career. Trussell said: \u201cWhen I\u2019m doing a podcast, there are moments where my whole universe changes because someone told me something that I never knew. Once you hear that, you\u2019re forever changed; you live in a completely different dimension than you lived in before.\u201d<ref name=\"The Daily Beast\">{{cite web |last1=Schager|first1=Nick |title=From the minds of \u201cAdventure Time\u201d creator Pendleton Ward and podcaster Duncan Trussell comes this fantastically beautiful head-trip of a show. |url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-midnight-gospel-on-netflix-is-trippy-horny-and-the-next-great-animated-show |website=[[The Daily Beast]]|accessdate=April 20, 2020 |date=April 20, 2020}}</ref> When Ward and Trussell started working on the scripts, Ward said it would be like taking an [[Indiana Jones]] movie and replacing the dialogue with podcast conversations.The main idea was to turn it into an entertaining animated show. They began to developing it out to following a concept. According Trussell that concept was \"During the apocalypse, people aren\u2019t just going to talk about the apocalypse, being in apocalyptic movies the situation revolves all around the survival.\u2019 Sort of the genesis of the show is what would happen if we took these podcast conversations and made them the dialogue that was happening during the various forms of the apocalypse.\u201d<ref name=\"ComingS\">{{cite web |last1=Hermanns|first1=Grant|title=CS Interview: Duncan Trussell on The Midnight Gospel |url=https://www.comingsoon.net/tv/features/1132053-cs-interview-duncan-trussell-on-the-midnight-gospel |website=[[Coming Soon]]|accessdate=April 21, 2020 |date=April 20, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe concept was expanded as the writer\u2019s room began exploring various potential apocalypses and finding a way to ensure that the podcast material was able to match up the storylines they built around the episode.<ref name=\"ComingS\"/> This was the main challenge of writing the episodes, besides choosing the best interviews, was making them coherent for animation.<ref name=\"CBRIn\"/> Trussell described as a \u201claborious process\u201d while also realizing it helped evolve into a series with a story arc.<ref name=\"ComingS\"/> They also worked to find a way to embed them in the psychedelic apocalyptic tapestry of the animation. They thought episodes should have a balance so the animation does not take people out of the interview. With an excessive focus on animation, people would not pay attention to everything equally. The team worked to let the conversations react with the world.<ref name=\"CBRIn\"/> According to Trussell, the influence for The Midnight Gospel come from [[Adult Swim]]'s lo-fi aesthetic in general and shows like Space Ghost: Coast 2 Coast and [[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]. Others references included the animated films \"[[Watership Down]]\" and \"[[The Last Unicorn (film)|The Last Unicorn]]\" and the animated television series \"[[\u00c6on Flux]]\" and \"[[Liquid Television]]\" and the mystery horror drama television series \"[[Twin Peaks]]\".<ref name=\"CBRIn\"/>\n\nFor Ward, it was Trussell\u2019s long-form audio chats that inspired him to return to TV animation<ref name=\"The Daily Beast\"/> and the new series was a chance to explore the brave, new world of making animation for grown-ups. Until then he had made animations for children only and ''The Midnight Gospel'' would be a chance to change his way of making animations using the ultra-violence of cartoons with conversations on compassion. Ward also allowed Trussell to include his own original music in several episodes. The show's title came from the good news sense of the word gospel. Trussell says, \"\u2019Gospel\u2019 means good news, and I was hoping that we convey the message that even through the most catastrophic situations, when everything is falling part, there is opportunity to grow as a person.\u201d<ref name=\"AnMag\"/>\n\nA second season for the show is uncertain. According to Trussell \"[the world of the Chromatic Ribbon] is a very big world. I spent a long time with Pen working out all the details. Some people might see it and think some people are saying gibberish, that something was absurd and unintended, but every brick in that structure, every piece of the puzzle is intentional and based on a lot of lore. It's a very, very, very, very interesting big world, and I would love to explore that world for as long as I possibly can.\"<ref name=\"CBRIn\"/>\n\n===Marketing===\nThe first teaser was released on March 16, and the main trailer on April 6. As part of promoting the show, Netflix's YouTube channel launched a livestream on April 19, 2020 with a countdown to the series' debut on the streaming service. Throughout the livestream, small portions of the episodes were shown as well as a psychedelic animation.<ref name=\"Countdown\"/>\n\n==Release==\nThe eight-episode first season, ordered by [[Netflix]], was released on April 20, 2020. According to Trussell, the Netflix executives first suggested dropping the series on the unofficial stoner holiday and Ward suggests putting the show out on 4/20. The date is Trussell's birthday and [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]-oriented celebrations that take place annually on April 20.<ref name=\"The Daily Beast\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|11639414}}\n\n{{Netflix original current series}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Midnight Gospel}}\n[[Category:2020 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2020s animated television series]]\n[[Category:American adult animated adventure television series]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Netflix original programming]]\n[[Category:Surrealist television series]]\n[[Category:Television series by Netflix Animation]]\n[[Category:Television series created by Pendleton Ward]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox television\n| show_name                = The Midnight Gospel\n| image                    = File:The Midnight Gospel promotional poster.jpg\n| caption                  = Promotional poster\n| genre                    = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Adult animation]]\n* [[Surrealism]]\n* [[Science fantasy]]\n* [[Dark comedy]]\n* [[Adventure fiction|Adventure]]\n* [[Interview]]\n}}\n| director                 = {{Plainlist|\n* Pendleton Ward\n* Mike L.

This sparks debate between Clancy and Glasses Man as to whether there is such a thing as a 'good drug' or a 'bad drug'.

Some time later Trussell and Ward became friends and Ward suggested to Trussell to turn his podcast into an animated series. According to Ward, Trussell had the ability to make 2 hours of a meditation conversation funny. Trussell says: \"He reached out to me and said he had an idea for how to animate my podcast, which was another big thrill for me.\"<ref name=\"Inverse\">{{cite web |last1=Kleinman |first1=Jake |title='Midnight Gospel' Was Seven Years In The Making.

In 2018, Ward approached to him again to show a rough concept taking a podcast conversation about drug addiction and playing it over an animatic of Trussell and his guest fighting off a zombie invasion.<ref name=\"Inverse\"/>\n\n===Writing and production===\n\nLater, this rough concept ended up being incorporated into the pilot of the series. The two took the concept of the series in pitching form to Mike Moon, head of adult animations at Netflix. In 2019, Netflix ordered eight episodes, which premiered on April 20th, 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/12/netflix-order-adult-animated-series-the-midnight-gospel-from-pendleton-ward-duncan-trussell-1202814276/|title=Netflix Orders Adult Animated Series \u2018The Midnight Gospel\u2019 From Pendleton Ward & Duncan Trussell|website=[[Deadline Hollywood|Deadline]]|first1=Denise|last1=Petski|accessdate=April 20, 2020|date=December 19, 2019}}</ref> After gaining the green light, the two gathered a team of comedians like [[Johnny Pemberton]], Brendon Walsh, [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]] and [[Emo Philips]] who were joined by occult scholar Jason Louv and white witch Maja D\u2019Aoust. The two assembled a team of approximately 190 people at Titmouse and started working on creating the episodes.<ref name=\"AnMag\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.animationmagazine.net/streaming/light-at-the-end-of-the-apocalypse-pen-ward-duncan-trussell-preach-the-midnight-gospel/|title=Light at the End of the Apocalypse: Pen Ward & Duncan Trussell Preach 'The Midnight Gospel'|website=Animation Magazine|first=Ramin|last=Zahed|date=April 16, 2020}}</ref> Mike Mayfield joined the project as supervising director and writer for all the episodes. The team behind the show is composed of Jesse Moynihan (art director), Antonio Canobbio (Chief Creative Officer for Titmouse), Mike Roush (animation director) and Joey Adams (storyboard supervisor). Mayfield said that the time needed to \"try something nine different ways before one little change would make it go from clunky to incredible.\"<ref name=\"AnMag\"/>\n\nDuring the beginning of production, they needed to know how much of the episodes will be story, to how much will be a podcast conversation, and they also need to choose which parts of the podcast to use in the show. According to Trussell, the parts of the podcast chosen for the series are about highlighting revelatory moments from his career. Trussell said: \u201cWhen I\u2019m doing a podcast, there are moments where my whole universe changes because someone told me something that I never knew. Once you hear that, you\u2019re forever changed; you live in a completely different dimension than you lived in before.\u201d<ref name=\"The Daily Beast\">{{cite web |last1=Schager|first1=Nick |title=From the minds of \u201cAdventure Time\u201d creator Pendleton Ward and podcaster Duncan Trussell comes this fantastically beautiful head-trip of a show. |url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-midnight-gospel-on-netflix-is-trippy-horny-and-the-next-great-animated-show |website=[[The Daily Beast]]|accessdate=April 20, 2020 |date=April 20, 2020}}</ref> When Ward and Trussell started working on the scripts, Ward said it would be like taking an [[Indiana Jones]] movie and replacing the dialogue with podcast conversations.The main idea was to turn it into an entertaining animated show. They began to developing it out to following a concept. According Trussell that concept was \"During the apocalypse, people aren\u2019t just going to talk about the apocalypse, being in apocalyptic movies the situation revolves all around the survival.\u2019 Sort of the genesis of the show is what would happen if we took these podcast conversations and made them the dialogue that was happening during the various forms of the apocalypse.\u201d <ref name=\"ComingS\">{{cite web |last1=Hermanns|first1=Grant|title=CS Interview: Duncan Trussell on The Midnight Gospel |url=https://www.comingsoon.net/tv/features/1132053-cs-interview-duncan-trussell-on-the-midnight-gospel |website=[[Coming Soon]]|accessdate=April 21, 2020 |date=April 20, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe concept was expanded as the writer\u2019s room began exploring various potential apocalypses and finding a way to ensure that the podcast material was able to match up the storylines they built around the episode.<ref name=\"ComingS\"/> This was the main challenge of writing the episodes, besides choosing the best interviews, was making them coherent for animation. <ref name=\"CBRIn\"/> Trussell described as a \u201claborious process\u201d while also realizing it helped evolve into a series with a story arc. <ref name=\"ComingS\"/> They also worked to find a way to embed them in the psychedelic apocalyptic tapestry of the animation. They thought episodes should have a balance so the animation does not take people out of the interview. With an excessive focus on animation, people would not pay attention to everything equally. The team worked to let the conversations react with the world.<ref name=\"CBRIn\"/> According to Trussell, the influence for The Midnight Gospel come from [[Adult Swim]]'s lo-fi aesthetic in general and shows like Space Ghost: Coast 2 Coast and [[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]. Others references included the animated films \"[[Watership Down]]\" and \"[[The Last Unicorn (film)|The Last Unicorn]]\" and the animated television series \"[[\u00c6on Flux]]\" and \"[[Liquid Television]]\" and the mystery horror drama television series \"[[Twin Peaks]]\".<ref name=\"CBRIn\"/>\n\nFor Ward, it was Trussell\u2019s long-form audio chats that inspired him to return to TV animation <ref name=\"The Daily Beast\"/> and the new series was a chance to explore the brave, new world of making animation for grown-ups. Until then he had made animations for children only and ''The Midnight Gospel'' would be a chance to change his way of making animations using the ultra-violence of cartoons with conversations on compassion. Ward also allowed Trussell to include his own original music in several episodes. The show's title came from the good news sense of the word gospel. Trussell says, \"\u2019Gospel\u2019 means good news, and I was hoping that we convey the message that even through the most catastrophic situations, when everything is falling part, there is opportunity to grow as a person.\u201d<ref name=\"AnMag\"/>\n\nA second season for the show is uncertain. According to Trussell \"[the world of the Chromatic Ribbon] is a very big world. I spent a long time with Pen working out all the details. Some people might see it and think some people are saying gibberish, that something was absurd and unintended, but every brick in that structure, every piece of the puzzle is intentional and based on a lot of lore. It's a very, very, very, very interesting big world, and I would love to explore that world for as long as I possibly can.\"<ref name=\"CBRIn\"/>\n\n===Marketing===\nThe first teaser was released on March 16, and the main trailer on April 6. As part of promoting the show, Netflix's YouTube channel launched a livestream on April 19, 2020 with a countdown to the series' debut on the streaming service. Throughout the livestream, small portions of the episodes were shown as well as a psychedelic animation.<ref name=\"Countdown\"/>\n\n==Release==\nThe eight-episode first season, ordered by [[Netflix]], was released on April 20, 2020. According to Trussell, the Netflix executives first suggested dropping the series on the unofficial stoner holiday and Ward suggests putting the show out on 4/20. The date is Trussell's birthday and [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]-oriented celebrations that take place annually on April 20.<ref name=\"The Daily Beast\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|11639414}}\n\n{{Netflix original current series}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Midnight Gospel}}\n[[Category:2020 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2020s animated television series]]\n[[Category:American adult animated adventure television series]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Netflix original programming]]\n[[Category:Surrealist television series]]\n[[Category:Television series by Netflix Animation]]\n[[Category:Television series created by Pendleton Ward]]\n", "name_user": "Prince Silversaddle", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Midnight_Gospel"}

In [[surface weather analysis|surface weather analyses]], fronts are depicted using various colored triangles and half-circles, depending on the type of front.  The air masses separated by a front usually differ in [[temperature]] and [[humidity]].\n\n[[Cold front]]s may feature narrow bands of [[thunderstorm]]s and [[severe weather]], and may on occasion be preceded by [[squall line]]s or [[dry line]]s. [[Warm front]]s are usually preceded by [[Stratus cloud|stratiform]] [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] and [[fog]]. The weather usually clears quickly after a front's passage.

Air mass classifications are indicated by three letters.  The first letter describes its [[moisture]] properties, with c used for continental air masses (dry) and m for maritime air masses (moist).  The second letter describes the [[thermal]] characteristic of its source region:  T for [[Tropics|tropical]], P for [[Polar regions of Earth|polar]], A for [[arctic]] or [[Antarctic]], M for [[monsoon]], E for [[Equatorial region|equatorial]], and S for superior air (dry air formed by significant upward motion in the atmosphere). The third letter designates the stability of the atmosphere. If the air mass is colder than the ground below it, it is labeled k. If the air mass is warmer than the ground below it, it is labeled w.<ref>Glossary of Meteorology.

''Air Apparent: How Meteorologists Learned to Map, Predict, and Dramatize Weather.''  University of Chicago Press. Chicago: 1999.</ref>  Weather maps are created by plotting or tracing the values of relevant quantities such as [[Atmospheric pressure|sea-level pressure]], [[temperature]], and [[cloud cover]] onto a [[Cartography|geographical map]] to help find [[Synoptic scale meteorology|synoptic scale]] features such as weather fronts.  Surface weather analyses have special symbols which show frontal systems, cloud cover, [[precipitation]], or other important information.  For example, an ''H'' may represent high pressure, implying fair weather.  An ''L'' on the other hand may represent low pressure, which frequently accompanies precipitation. Low pressure also creates surface winds deriving from high pressure zones.  Various symbols are used not just for frontal zones and other surface boundaries on weather maps, but also to depict the present weather at various locations on the weather map.  In addition, areas of precipitation help determine the frontal type and location.<ref name=\"disc1\"/>\n\n==<span id='Front Types'>Types</span>==\nThere are two different meanings used within meteorology to describe weather around a frontal zone. The term \"[[wikt:anafront|anafront]]\" describes boundaries which show instability, meaning air rises rapidly along and over the boundary to cause significant weather changes.  A \"[[wikt:katafront|katafront]]\" is weaker, bringing smaller changes in temperature and moisture, as well as limited rainfall.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ew3MBjbw4OAC&pg=PA309|title=The environment: principles and applications|author=Chris C.

''[[Atmospheric convection|Convective precipitation]]'' (showers, thundershowers, and related unstable weather) is caused by air being lifted and condensing into clouds by the movement of the cold front or cold occlusion under a mass of warmer, moist air.  If the temperature differences of the two air masses involved are large and the turbulence is extreme because of [[wind shear]] and the presence of a strong [[jet stream]], \"[[roll cloud]]s\" and [[tornado]]es may occur.<ref>{{cite web|work=Glossary of Meteorology|title=Convection|year=|accessdate=2006-10-22|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&query=convection|publisher=American Meteorological Society}}</ref>\n\nIn the warm [[season]], lee troughs, breezes, outflow boundaries and occlusions can lead to convection if enough moisture is available. ''[[Orographic lift|Orographic precipitation]]'' is precipitation created through the lifting action of air moving over terrain such as mountains and hills, which is most common behind cold fronts that move into mountainous areas. It may sometimes occur in advance of warm fronts moving northward to the east of mountainous terrain. However, precipitation along warm fronts is relatively steady, as in rain or drizzle. Fog, sometimes extensive and dense, often occurs in pre-warm-frontal areas.<ref>{{cite web|work=Glossary of Meteorology|title=Orographic Lifting|year=|accessdate=2006-10-22|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=orographic-lifting1|publisher=American Meteorological Society}}</ref>  Although, not all fronts produce precipitation or even clouds because moisture must be present in the air mass which is being lifted.<ref name=\"stm\" />\n\n==Movement==\nFronts are generally guided by [[winds aloft]], but do not move as quickly.  Cold fronts and occluded fronts in the Northern Hemisphere usually travel from the northwest to southeast, while warm fronts move more poleward with time. In the Northern Hemisphere a warm front moves from southwest to northeast. In the Southern Hemisphere, the reverse is true; a cold front usually moves from southwest to northeast, and a warm front moves from northwest to southeast. Movement is largely caused by the pressure gradient force (horizontal differences in atmospheric pressure) and the [[Coriolis effect]], which is caused by [[Earth]]'s spinning about its axis. Frontal zones can be slowed down by geographic features like mountains and large bodies of warm water.<ref name=\"DR\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Weather}}\n* [[Cyclogenesis]]\n* [[Extratropical cyclone]]\n* [[Norwegian cyclone model]]\n* [[Surface weather analysis]]\n* [[Trough (meteorology)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* (1999).

''Air Apparent: How Meteorologists Learned to Map, Predict, and Dramatize Weather.''  University of Chicago Press. Chicago: 1999.</ref>  Weather maps are created by plotting or tracing the values of relevant quantities such as [[Atmospheric pressure|sea-level pressure]], [[temperature]], and [[cloud cover]] onto a [[Cartography|geographical map]] to help find [[Synoptic scale meteorology|synoptic scale]] features such as weather fronts.  Surface weather analyses have special symbols which show frontal systems, cloud cover, [[precipitation]], or other important information.  For example, an ''H'' may represent high pressure, implying fair weather.  An ''L'' on the other hand may represent low pressure, which frequently accompanies precipitation. Low pressure also creates surface winds deriving from high pressure zones.  Various symbols are used not just for frontal zones and other surface boundaries on weather maps, but also to depict the present weather at various locations on the weather map.  In addition, areas of precipitation help determine the frontal type and location.<ref name=\"disc1\"/>\n\n==<span id='Front Types'>Types</span>==\nThere are two different meanings used within meteorology to describe weather around a frontal zone.

Dry lines are one of the few surface fronts where the pips indicated do not necessarily reflect the direction of motion.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=University of Illinois Department of Atmospheric Science|title=Dry Line:  A Moisture Boundary|year=|accessdate=2006-10-22|url=http://ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu/(Gl)/guides/mtr/af/frnts/dfdef.rxml}}</ref>\n\n===Squall line===\n{{Main|Squall line}}\n[[File:DangerousShelfCloud.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|A shelf cloud such as this one can be a sign that a squall is imminent]]\nOrganized areas of thunderstorm activity not only reinforce pre-existing frontal zones, but can outrun cold fronts in a pattern where the upper level jet splits apart into two streams, with the resultant [[Mesoscale convective system|Mesoscale Convective System]] (MCS) forming at the point of the upper level split in the wind pattern running southeast into the warm sector parallel to low-level thickness lines. When the convection is strong and linear or curved, the MCS is called a squall line, with the feature placed at the leading edge of the significant wind shift and pressure rise.<ref>{{cite web|author=Office of the Federal Coordinator for Meteorology |title=Chapter 2:  Definitions |accessdate=2006-10-22 |url=http://www.ofcm.gov/slso/pdf/slsochp2.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506002006/http://www.ofcm.gov/slso/pdf/slsochp2.pdf |archivedate=2009-05-06 }}</ref>  Even weaker and less organized areas of thunderstorms lead to locally cooler air and higher pressures, and outflow boundaries exist ahead of this type of activity, which can act as foci for additional thunderstorm activity later in the day.<ref>{{cite web|author=Michael Branick|title=A Comprehensive Glossary of Weather|year=|publisher=American Meteorological Society|accessdate=2006-10-22|url=http://www.geographic.org/climate/o.html}}</ref>\n\nThese features are often depicted in the warm season across the United States on surface analyses and lie within surface troughs. If outflow boundaries or squall lines form over arid regions, a [[haboob]] may result.<ref>{{cite web|author=Western Region Climate Center|title=H|year=|accessdate=2006-10-22|url=http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/ams/glossary.html#H}}</ref> Squall lines are depicted on NWS surface analyses as an alternating pattern of two red dots and a dash labelled SQLN or SQUALL LINE, while outflow boundaries are depicted as troughs with a label of OUTFLOW BOUNDARY.\n\n==Precipitation produced==\n{{main|Precipitation}}\n[[File:Konvektionsregen.jpg|thumb|Convective precipitation]]\nFronts are the principal cause of significant weather. ''[[Atmospheric convection|Convective precipitation]]'' (showers, thundershowers, and related unstable weather) is caused by air being lifted and condensing into clouds by the movement of the cold front or cold occlusion under a mass of warmer, moist air.  If the temperature differences of the two air masses involved are large and the turbulence is extreme because of [[wind shear]] and the presence of a strong [[jet stream]], \"[[roll cloud]]s\" and [[tornado]]es may occur.<ref>{{cite web|work=Glossary of Meteorology|title=Convection|year=|accessdate=2006-10-22|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&query=convection|publisher=American Meteorological Society}}</ref>\n\nIn the warm [[season]], lee troughs, breezes, outflow boundaries and occlusions can lead to convection if enough moisture is available. ''[[Orographic lift|Orographic precipitation]]'' is precipitation created through the lifting action of air moving over terrain such as mountains and hills, which is most common behind cold fronts that move into mountainous areas. It may sometimes occur in advance of warm fronts moving northward to the east of mountainous terrain. However, precipitation along warm fronts is relatively steady, as in rain or drizzle. Fog, sometimes extensive and dense, often occurs in pre-warm-frontal areas.<ref>{{cite web|work=Glossary of Meteorology|title=Orographic Lifting|year=|accessdate=2006-10-22|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=orographic-lifting1|publisher=American Meteorological Society}}</ref>  Although, not all fronts produce precipitation or even clouds because moisture must be present in the air mass which is being lifted.<ref name=\"stm\" />\n\n==Movement==\nFronts are generally guided by [[winds aloft]], but do not move as quickly.  Cold fronts and occluded fronts in the Northern Hemisphere usually travel from the northwest to southeast, while warm fronts move more poleward with time. In the Northern Hemisphere a warm front moves from southwest to northeast. In the Southern Hemisphere, the reverse is true; a cold front usually moves from southwest to northeast, and a warm front moves from northwest to southeast. Movement is largely caused by the pressure gradient force (horizontal differences in atmospheric pressure) and the [[Coriolis effect]], which is caused by [[Earth]]'s spinning about its axis. Frontal zones can be slowed down by geographic features like mountains and large bodies of warm water.<ref name=\"DR\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Weather}}\n* [[Cyclogenesis]]\n* [[Extratropical cyclone]]\n* [[Norwegian cyclone model]]\n* [[Surface weather analysis]]\n* [[Trough (meteorology)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* (1999).

It was created and written by [[Patrick Ness]], who also produced alongside ''Doctor Who'' showrunner and lead writer [[Steven Moffat]], and Brian Minchin, who acted as producer on ''Doctor Who'' and two of its previous spin-offs, ''[[Torchwood]]'' and ''[[The Sarah Jane Adventures]]''.\n\nThe series of eight episodes was released on [[BBC Three (online)|BBC Three]] between 22 October and 3 December 2016. The story focuses on five of the students and staff at [[Coal Hill School|Coal Hill Academy]], a longtime recurrent location of ''Doctor Who'', who are tasked by the [[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|Doctor]] to deal with alien threats while trying to deal with their personal lives.\n\nThe series received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise for its darker tone, writing, themes, characters, and acting. However, the series scored poor viewership figures for its broadcast on [[BBC One]]. In September 2017, BBC Three confirmed that the series was cancelled.\n\nIn 2018 [[Big Finish Productions]] produced a series of six ''Class'' audio adventures, telling the further adventures of the students at Coal Hill Academy. Six more audio adventures were announced for release starting in April 2020, with 2 of the main characters being recast.<ref>{{cite news |title=Doctor Who spin-off Class is returning, but with some big changes |url=https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/a30030770/doctor-who-class-returning-big-finish-recasting-characters/ |accessdate=14 December 2019 |agency=Digital Spy |date=28 November 2019}}</ref><!--Per WP:CITELEAD, references are not needed in the lead if it is sourced in the body of the article!-->{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Premise==\nThe programme is set in [[Coal Hill School|Coal Hill Academy]], a fictional school that has been featured in ''Doctor Who'' since the 1963 serial, ''[[An Unearthly Child]]'', and focuses on six of its students and staff members.<ref name=\"CoalHillAcademy\">{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/tv/class/37676/class-barbara-wright-tribute-revealed|title=Class: Barbara Wright tribute revealed|author=Rob Leane|work=Den of Geek}}</ref>\n\nThe [[sixth form]]ers of Coal Hill Academy all have their own secrets and desires.<ref name=\"CoalHillAcademy\"/> They have to deal with the stresses of everyday life, including friends, parents, school work, sex, and sorrow, but also the horrors that come from time travel.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.gamenguide.com/articles/52982/20161008/doctor-who-spinoff-air-date-news-update-class-coal-hill-students-left-alone-to-fight-aliens-time-travel-danger-impending.htm|accessdate=23 October 2016|title='Doctor Who' Spinoff Air Date, News & Update: 'Class' \u2013 Coal Hill Students Left Alone To Fight Aliens, Time Travel Danger Impending?|date=8 October 2016|first=LA|last=Zamora|work=Gamenguide}}</ref> The Doctor and his time-travelling have made the walls of space and time stretch thin, and monsters beyond imagination are planning to break through and wreak havoc upon the Earth.<ref>{{citation|url=https://inews.co.uk/essentials/culture/television/creator-ya-doctor-spin-off-class-exclusively-tells-us-whats-store/|accessdate=23 October 2016|title=The creator of Doctor Who spin-off 'Class' tells us what's in store|work=Inews|first=Stephen|last=Kelly|date=18 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n* [[Greg Austin (actor)|Greg Austin]] as Charlie Smith, an alien posing as a human student.

Elsewhere, Ames returns to the Governors where she is judged unfit to continue serving them or witness \"the arrival\" for having allowed the Cabinet to be used, and is murdered by a [[Weeping Angel]].<!--PER WP:TVPLOT, DO NOT EXTEND THIS SUMMARY PAST 200 WORDS!-->\n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nThe programme was announced on 1 October 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/doctorwho/entries/953c5b1f-3cc8-4db9-8184-f1b6567260f1|title=BBC Latest News \u2013 Doctor Who \u2013 Doctor Who Spin Off: Class|author=The Doctor Who Team|work=Doctor Who}}</ref> [[Steven Moffat]] executive-produces the programme.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2016-02-29/doctor-who-spin-off-class-to-start-filming-in-april-with-peter-capaldi-set-to-pop-up-in-new-show|title=Doctor Who spin off Class begins filming in April 2016 and may feature Peter Capaldi|publisher=[[RadioTimes]]|last=Dowell|first=Ben|date=29 February 2016|accessdate=29 February 2016}}</ref> It was revealed on 27 April 2016 that Coal Hill was now an [[Academy (English school)|academy]].<ref name=\"CoalHillAcademy\" /> [[Edward Bazalgette|Ed Bazalgette]] was the first director announced for the series.<ref name=\"cast\"/> Philippa Langdale directed two episodes,<ref name=\"UAPL\">{{cite web|url=http://www.unitedagents.co.uk/philippa-langdale|title=United Agents: Philippa Langdale}}</ref> Wayne Yip also directed a number of episodes for the series,<ref name=\"UAWY\">{{cite web|url=http://www.unitedagents.co.uk/wayne-yip|title=United Agents: Wayne Yip}}</ref> and Julian Holmes directed the finale.<ref name=\"Finale Director\">{{cite tweet|user=julianmholmes|author=Julian Holmes|number=767827413392818177|date=22 August 2016|title=Totally thrilled and excited to be directing the epic final\u00e9 of the wonderfully heartfelt #Class.

In the US, the premiere pulled in half a million viewers despite running immediately following ''Doctor Who'', losing almost half its forerunner's audience.<ref name=\"Digital Spy\"/>\n\n===Critical response===\n\nDespite poor ratings, overall reception from critics for the series was mostly positive. It received praise for its darker tone, writing, themes, and acting, as well as for the overall evolution of the characters during the series; Katherine Kelly and her character Miss Quill, in particular, were singled out. However, the Shadow Kin were considered weak enemies, and the first episodes and finale were criticized for their fast pacing. Reviewers noted that the show was similar to ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', with some critics considering it a quality that made it stand out more from ''Doctor Who'', and others being critical of it.<ref name=\"AVClub\">{{cite web |url=https://tv.avclub.com/doctor-who-gets-its-own-hellmouth-in-the-teen-centric-s-1798191025 |title=Doctor Who gets its own Hellmouth in the teen-centric spin-off Class|first=Caroline |last=Siede |website=[[The A.V.

Club]]'' gave a show a B rating, particularly praising the \"winning cast of incredibly talented young British actors and its casual diversity, which many contemporary teen shows strive for, but which few pull off so effortlessly.\" They highly praised the show's representation of homosexual characters, \"presented with a refreshing matter-of-factness, not a self-congratulatory pat on the back\", the performances (especially Kelly's whom they called a \"scene-stealer\"), and the characters, stating \"There\u2019s not a weak link among the uniformly excellent ensemble and the show serves its teenage characters particularly well by allowing them to have an emotional intelligence that\u2019s not always granted to young protagonists. [...] The most successful parts of the series explore the ways the students support one another through all the weighty challenges they\u2019re faced with, both of the real-world and sci-fi variety. And it weaves in just enough comedy to keep things from becoming too maudlin or too bleak.\" However, they felt that the science-fiction elements of the series felt out of place: \"the extensive exposition needed to introduce the show\u2019s ever-growing mythology starts to sound like someone perpetually reading out the rules for an increasingly complicated adventure board game. As quickly as one element is introduced, more complications are thrown on top of it, leaving the series with little room to breathe.\"<ref name=\"AVClub\"/>\n\n''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the show a B rating, highly praising the cast: \"The young actors are all very talented and have no trouble handling the show\u2019s heavier material. In fact, I found myself wishing there had been more than just eight episodes in the first season because it would\u2019ve been nice to have seen a bit more of the group\u2019s lighthearted side. That being said, the show\u2019s MVP is clearly Kelly, whose Quill not only delivers some of the best lines but also the best arc of the season. Without giving too much away, her dynamic with one of the student leads is the source of some of the season\u2019s most interesting thematic material.\" However, they regretted that the show's darker tone made it \"slightly less fun\" than ''Doctor Who''.<ref name=\"EW\">{{cite magazine|url=http://ew.com/tv/2017/04/13/class-review/|title=Class: EW Review|first=Chancellor|last=Agard|date=13 April 2017|accessdate=8 July 2017|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]}}</ref> The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' gave the series a mixed review, stating that Ness' storytelling felt \"muddled and mechanical\" and \"tells you too much, too fast.\" They however praised that \"The female roles are especially strong and well played\", particularly praising the performances of Kelly, Sophie Hopkins and Vivian Oparah.<ref name=\"LATimes\"/>\n\nIn a post-cancellation review of the series, Morgan Jeffrey of ''[[Digital Spy]]'' debated the reasons the series was unsuccessful in finding an audience, called the show \"the spin-off no-one asked for\", and argued that the reason it failed in ratings was due to the BBC not knowing who the show was for: \"A teen-oriented drama with adult themes, spun off from a series intended (primarily) for children, the tone of ''Class'' was every bit as confused as that muddled origin would suggest.\"<ref name=\"Digital Spy\">{{cite web |last1=Jeffrey |first1=Morgan |title=Here's why the Doctor Who spin-off Class just didn't work |url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/class/feature/a830699/doctor-who-spin-off-class-why-it-just-didnt-work/ |website=Digital Spy |accessdate=6 June 2018}}</ref> However, and despite having given the show's premiere a mixed review, he stated that \"''Class'' wasn't a total write-off.

It was created and written by [[Patrick Ness]], who also produced alongside ''Doctor Who'' showrunner and lead writer [[Steven Moffat]], and Brian Minchin, who acted as producer on ''Doctor Who'' and two of its previous spin-offs, ''[[Torchwood]]'' and ''[[The Sarah Jane Adventures]]''.\n\nThe series of eight episodes was released on [[BBC Three (online)|BBC Three]] between 22 October and 3 December 2016. The story focuses on five of the students and staff at [[Coal Hill School|Coal Hill Academy]], a longtime recurrent location of ''Doctor Who'', who are tasked by the [[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|Doctor]] to deal with alien threats while trying to deal with their personal lives.\n\nThe series received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise for its darker tone, writing, themes, characters, and acting. However, the series scored poor viewership figures for its broadcast on [[BBC One]]. In September 2017, BBC Three confirmed that the series was cancelled.\n\nIn 2018 [[Big Finish Productions]] produced a series of six ''Class'' audio adventures, telling the further adventures of the students at Coal Hill Academy.

Coach Dawson scolds him for poor performance in football and demotes him to the second string team. That week, Ram witnesses a creature attack both the assistant coach and a school cleaner, but struggles to find evidence of their deaths after the fact, leading him to question his sanity. Tanya, Charlie, and April investigate on his behalf, and learn that a dragon manifesting in different parts of the school is connected with Coach Dawson. They learn that the coach was bound to a female dragon who came through a rift in time, and became fused to his body as a tattoo; its mate roams the school, killing in order to feed her. Convinced by the sixth formers, the male dragon takes his mate along with the coach back through the tear in time. Ram later tells his father about the events thus far.<!--PER WP:TVPLOT, DO NOT EXTEND THIS SUMMARY PAST 200 WORDS!-->\n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 3\n |Title           = [[Nightvisiting]]\n |DirectedBy      = Ed Bazalgette\n |WrittenBy       = Patrick Ness\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|10|29|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary    = <!--PER WP:TVPLOT, DO NOT EXTEND THIS SUMMARY PAST 200 WORDS!-->On the second anniversary of her father's death, Tanya is visited by an apparition of him, imploring her to take his hand and bond their souls across space and time.

Dorothea Ames introduces herself as the new headteacher of Coal Hill Academy following the death of Mr Armitage. She tells Miss Quill of how the Governors are interested in her and later introduces her to an alien carnivorous flower that has been replicating in worrying numbers. April's father is released from prison and pays his family a visit. During a key confrontation, April's parents discover the true nature of her problem as she uncontrollably attacks the both of them. Sensing that Corakinus has discovered her location, April leaps through a tear in space-time to take her heart back, with Ram closely following her.<!--PER WP:TVPLOT, DO NOT EXTEND THIS SUMMARY PAST 200 WORDS!-->\n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 5\n |Title           = [[Brave-ish Heart]]\n |RTitle          = {{nbsp}}(Part 2)\n |DirectedBy      = Philippa Langdale\n |WrittenBy       = Patrick Ness\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|11|12|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary    = <!--PER WP:TVPLOT, DO NOT EXTEND THIS SUMMARY PAST 200 WORDS!-->April and Ram arrive on the planet of the Shadow Kin, referred to as the Underneath, where she seeks out the king to claim her heart back.

Dorothea Ames recruits Miss Quill to force Charlie into using the Cabinet of Souls (a weapon of mass destruction made up of the preserved souls of his species) in order to kill the petals, but he seems torn between sacrificing the souls of his people and letting humanity die instead. Channelling the king's own power, April defeats him in combat and becomes king of the Shadow Kin. Returning to Earth, she dispatches her army to destroy the petals, sparing Charlie his decision. The imprisoned former king severs his connection with April, however, once again breaking her control over the Shadow Kin.

The three of them are teleported to a metaphysical reality. Ames explains that as long as a place can be believed in, it exists and can be visited using this device. Over time, they find an Arn specimen to study, obtain the blood of the 'Devil' (to unfreeze Ballon so that he can perform surgery on Quill). They finally obtain the brain of a Quill goddess to study before returning to Coal Hill. Ballon performs the surgery and removes the Arn, freeing Quill but leaving her eye scarred.

Quill teaches Tanya how to fight in preparation for an inevitable war whilst both Ram and Tanya command Charlie to use the Cabinet of Souls in order to prevent any more people from dying.

He decides to use the Cabinet of Souls, which is expected to also kill April and himself. The Cabinet wipes out every last Shadow Kin. Charlie, saved by Quill, survives, while April awakens in the body of Corakinus. Elsewhere, Ames returns to the Governors where she is judged unfit to continue serving them or witness \"the arrival\" for having allowed the Cabinet to be used, and is murdered by a [[Weeping Angel]].<!--PER WP:TVPLOT, DO NOT EXTEND THIS SUMMARY PAST 200 WORDS!-->\n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nThe programme was announced on 1 October 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/doctorwho/entries/953c5b1f-3cc8-4db9-8184-f1b6567260f1|title=BBC Latest News \u2013 Doctor Who \u2013 Doctor Who Spin Off: Class|author=The Doctor Who Team|work=Doctor Who}}</ref> [[Steven Moffat]] executive-produces the programme.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2016-02-29/doctor-who-spin-off-class-to-start-filming-in-april-with-peter-capaldi-set-to-pop-up-in-new-show|title=Doctor Who spin off Class begins filming in April 2016 and may feature Peter Capaldi|publisher=[[RadioTimes]]|last=Dowell|first=Ben|date=29 February 2016|accessdate=29 February 2016}}</ref> It was revealed on 27 April 2016 that Coal Hill was now an [[Academy (English school)|academy]].<ref name=\"CoalHillAcademy\" /> [[Edward Bazalgette|Ed Bazalgette]] was the first director announced for the series.<ref name=\"cast\"/> Philippa Langdale directed two episodes,<ref name=\"UAPL\">{{cite web|url=http://www.unitedagents.co.uk/philippa-langdale|title=United Agents: Philippa Langdale}}</ref> Wayne Yip also directed a number of episodes for the series,<ref name=\"UAWY\">{{cite web|url=http://www.unitedagents.co.uk/wayne-yip|title=United Agents: Wayne Yip}}</ref> and Julian Holmes directed the finale.<ref name=\"Finale Director\">{{cite tweet|user=julianmholmes|author=Julian Holmes|number=767827413392818177|date=22 August 2016|title=Totally thrilled and excited to be directing the epic final\u00e9 of the wonderfully heartfelt #Class.

In the US, the premiere pulled in half a million viewers despite running immediately following ''Doctor Who'', losing almost half its forerunner's audience.<ref name=\"Digital Spy\"/>\n\n===Critical response===\n\nDespite poor ratings, overall reception from critics for the series was mostly positive. It received praise for its darker tone, writing, themes, and acting, as well as for the overall evolution of the characters during the series; Katherine Kelly and her character Miss Quill, in particular, were singled out. However, the Shadow Kin were considered weak enemies, and the first episodes and finale were criticized for their fast pacing. Reviewers noted that the show was similar to ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', with some critics considering it a quality that made it stand out more from ''Doctor Who'', and others being critical of it.<ref name=\"AVClub\">{{cite web |url=https://tv.avclub.com/doctor-who-gets-its-own-hellmouth-in-the-teen-centric-s-1798191025 |title=Doctor Who gets its own Hellmouth in the teen-centric spin-off Class|first=Caroline |last=Siede |website=[[The A.V.

As is the case with good teen horror dramas that has come before it, ''Class''{{'}} scariest, most interesting villains aren\u2019t alien monsters that wipe out entire civilizations, but rather the real-world problems like losing a parent, a girlfriend, or losing the time and space to simply be a kid.\" However, they criticized the show for being too different from ''Doctor Who'', stating \"If you\u2019re looking for more of the science fiction idealism that ''Doctor Who'' tends to provide, stick to the new season. Here be dragons (sometimes literally) and they will unceremoniously kill people.\"<ref name=\"Collider\"/>\n\n''[[The A.V. Club]]'' gave a show a B rating, particularly praising the \"winning cast of incredibly talented young British actors and its casual diversity, which many contemporary teen shows strive for, but which few pull off so effortlessly.\" They highly praised the show's representation of homosexual characters, \"presented with a refreshing matter-of-factness, not a self-congratulatory pat on the back\", the performances (especially Kelly's whom they called a \"scene-stealer\"), and the characters, stating \"There\u2019s not a weak link among the uniformly excellent ensemble and the show serves its teenage characters particularly well by allowing them to have an emotional intelligence that\u2019s not always granted to young protagonists. [...] The most successful parts of the series explore the ways the students support one another through all the weighty challenges they\u2019re faced with, both of the real-world and sci-fi variety. And it weaves in just enough comedy to keep things from becoming too maudlin or too bleak.\" However, they felt that the science-fiction elements of the series felt out of place: \"the extensive exposition needed to introduce the show\u2019s ever-growing mythology starts to sound like someone perpetually reading out the rules for an increasingly complicated adventure board game. As quickly as one element is introduced, more complications are thrown on top of it, leaving the series with little room to breathe.\"<ref name=\"AVClub\"/>\n\n''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the show a B rating, highly praising the cast: \"The young actors are all very talented and have no trouble handling the show\u2019s heavier material. In fact, I found myself wishing there had been more than just eight episodes in the first season because it would\u2019ve been nice to have seen a bit more of the group\u2019s lighthearted side. That being said, the show\u2019s MVP is clearly Kelly, whose Quill not only delivers some of the best lines but also the best arc of the season. Without giving too much away, her dynamic with one of the student leads is the source of some of the season\u2019s most interesting thematic material.\" However, they regretted that the show's darker tone made it \"slightly less fun\" than ''Doctor Who''.<ref name=\"EW\">{{cite magazine|url=http://ew.com/tv/2017/04/13/class-review/|title=Class: EW Review|first=Chancellor|last=Agard|date=13 April 2017|accessdate=8 July 2017|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]}}</ref> The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' gave the series a mixed review, stating that Ness' storytelling felt \"muddled and mechanical\" and \"tells you too much, too fast.\" They however praised that \"The female roles are especially strong and well played\", particularly praising the performances of Kelly, Sophie Hopkins and Vivian Oparah.<ref name=\"LATimes\"/>\n\nIn a post-cancellation review of the series, Morgan Jeffrey of ''[[Digital Spy]]'' debated the reasons the series was unsuccessful in finding an audience, called the show \"the spin-off no-one asked for\", and argued that the reason it failed in ratings was due to the BBC not knowing who the show was for: \"A teen-oriented drama with adult themes, spun off from a series intended (primarily) for children, the tone of ''Class'' was every bit as confused as that muddled origin would suggest.\"<ref name=\"Digital Spy\">{{cite web |last1=Jeffrey |first1=Morgan |title=Here's why the Doctor Who spin-off Class just didn't work |url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/class/feature/a830699/doctor-who-spin-off-class-why-it-just-didnt-work/ |website=Digital Spy |accessdate=6 June 2018}}</ref> However, and despite having given the show's premiere a mixed review, he stated that \"''Class'' wasn't a total write-off. Far from it. The show absolutely had its gripping moments, its standout episodes (the poignant \"Nightvisiting\" was a clear highlight) \u2013 and, oh, what a cast.

He was the third of three children.<ref name=\"guard\"/> Barratt's early schooling took place at [[Clifton College]] and after winning a scholarship to [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge]], he graduated with a [[British undergraduate degree classification#First-class honours|First-class honours]] in [[Natural Sciences (Cambridge)|Natural Sciences]].<ref name=\"guard\"/>\n\nThroughout his life, Barratt suffered from [[facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy]], a disease that causes progressive weakness, which forced him to retire early, eventually forcing him to use wheelchair for movement. In retirement he kept up to date with the latest developments in paediatric nephrology.<ref name=\"renal\"/>\n\n==Career==\nBarratt completed his clinical training at [[St Thomas' Hospital|St Thomas' medical school]]. After a number of house positions, he was appointed as a registrar at the [[Institute of Child Health]], [[Great Ormond Street Hospital]] working with Professor [[Barbara Clayton]].<ref name=\"rcp\"/><ref name=\"guard\"/> Barratt then spent a year as a [[research fellow]] at [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine]], Baltimore, working within the Department [[pharmacology]] and experimental therapeutics,<ref name=\"rcp\"/> and researching [[fluid physiology]] with [[Mackenzie Walser]].<ref name=\"renal\"/> Upon returning to the UK in 1967, Barratt was appointed as a [[lecturer]] working on [[Pediatrics|paediatric]] [[nephrology]] with Professor [[John Soothill]] at the Institute.<ref name=\"rcp\"/> In 1971, Barratt was promoted to senior lecturer in the Institute of Child Health and consultant paediatric nephrologist at Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children<ref name=\"renal\"/> and in 1978 promoted to professor of paediatric nephrology.<ref name=\"rcp\"/>\n\nIn 1966 Barratt married Gill Owen, a [[social worker]] who was later promoted to [[Group analysis|group analyst]] and [[Psychotherapy|psychotherapist]].<ref name=\"renal\"/>\n\n==Contributions==\n===Research===\nWhen Barratt started his clinical career, the specialism of paediatric nephrology in the UK, outwith certain areas, was primitive.<ref name=\"renal\"/> Barratt held the first post that was specifically committed, both academically and professionally to the treatment of children with renal disease.<ref name=\"renal\"/>\n\nBarratt initially worked by himself, but was joined by [[Michael Dillon (paediatric nephrology)|Michael Dillon]] in 1975, and together they built a major world class paediatric nephrology services department at Great Ormond Street Hospital and conducted a research programme at the Institute of Child Health. Barratt was later joined by [[Richard Trompeter (Paediatric Nephrologist)|Richard Trompeter]] and [[Lesley Rees (Paediatric Nephrologist)|Lesley Rees]] who continued the work of Barratt.<ref name=\"renal\"/>\n\nBarratt early in his career realized that collaboration was needed in developing an interdisciplinary care model for the treatment of children with renal diseases, eventually working closely with the paediatric urologists [[David Innes Williams]] and [[Philip G. Ransley]] and the paediatric imager, [[Isky Gordon]].<ref name=\"renal\"/>\n\nBarratt had a broad research focus, conducting research into [[Renal function#Glomerular filtration rate|GFR measurement]], [[Kidney stone disease|urolithiasis]], [[Cystic kidney disease|renal cystic disease]], [[Diabetes mellitus]], [[kidney disorders]], renal function after cardiopulmonary bypass, genetic studies in inherited kidney disorders and the urological disorders in children. It was research into childhood [[Nephrotic syndrome]] and the [[Hemolytic-uremic syndrome]] that was his most notable work, particularly the biological roles played by [[atopy]], [[Membrane potential|membrane charge]] and [[Cytokine]] release. Barratt undertook a number of trials to determine the best treatments with patients with nephrotic symptoms. In 1970, Barratt conducted a trial with the [[Immunology|immunologist]] John Soothill, using [[cyclophosphamide]] treatment for [[nephrotic syndrome]]. Barratt tested the drugs [[Azathioprine]], [[Levamisole]] and [[Ciclosporin|cyclosporine A]] in subsequent trials, eventually working with paediatrician [[Michael Levin]] and others to study [[Pathogenesis|pathogenetic]] mechanisms involved in the syndrome, including e.g. [[Platelet-derived growth factor]] and [[Prostacyclin|prostacyclin inhibition]].<ref name=\"renal\"/> Levin who was Barratt's registrar at Great Ormond Street stated of Barratt, that:\n\n:''Clinically, Martin had the most wonderful clarity of thought\u2014making the most complex issues clear. He had an absolute belief that the job of a consultant was to offer patients the best of all available evidence''.<ref name=\"bmj\"/>\n\nBarratt was considered an outstanding teacher and lecturer.<ref name=\"renal\"/>\n\n==Association work==\nFrom 1972 to 1976, Barratt was secretary of the [[British Association for Paediatric Nephrology]], and from 1994 to 1997 he was president of the association.<ref name=\"renal\"/> Barratt worked with the [[European Society for Paediatric Nephrology]] and the [[International Pediatric Nephrology Association]].  After his retirement, in 1998, Barratt was co-president along with the paediatrician Sir [[Cyril Chantler]] of the 11th Congress of the International Pediatric Nephrology Association.\n\n==Bibliography==\nThe following papers were his most well known and cited:\n\n* {{cite journal |last1=Smellie |first1=Jean M. |last2=Barratt |first2=T.

In retirement he kept up to date with the latest developments in paediatric nephrology.<ref name=\"renal\"/>\n\n==Career==\nBarratt completed his clinical training at [[St Thomas' Hospital|St Thomas' medical school]]. After a number of house positions, he was appointed as a registrar at the [[Institute of Child Health]], [[Great Ormond Street Hospital]] working with Professor [[Barbara Clayton]].<ref name=\"rcp\"/><ref name=\"guard\"/> Barratt then spent a year as a [[research fellow]] at [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine]], Baltimore, working within the Department [[pharmacology]] and experimental therapeutics,<ref name=\"rcp\"/> and researching [[fluid physiology]] with [[Mackenzie Walser]].<ref name=\"renal\"/> Upon returning to the UK in 1967, Barratt was appointed as a [[lecturer]] working on [[Pediatrics|paediatric]] [[nephrology]] with Professor [[John Soothill]] at the Institute.<ref name=\"rcp\"/> In 1971, Barratt was promoted to senior lecturer in the Institute of Child Health and consultant paediatric nephrologist at Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children<ref name=\"renal\"/> and in 1978 promoted to professor of paediatric nephrology.<ref name=\"rcp\"/>\n\nIn 1966 Barratt married Gill Owen, a [[social worker]] who was later promoted to [[Group analysis|group analyst]] and [[Psychotherapy|psychotherapist]].<ref name=\"renal\"/>\n\n==Contributions==\n===Research===\nWhen Barratt started his clinical career, the specialism of paediatric nephrology in the UK, outwith certain areas, was primitive.<ref name=\"renal\"/> Barratt held the first post that was specifically committed, both academically and professionally to the treatment of children with renal disease.<ref name=\"renal\"/>\n\nBarratt initially worked by himself, but was joined by [[Michael Dillon (paediatric nephrology)|Michael Dillon]] in 1975, and together they built a major world class paediatric nephrology services department at Great Ormond Street Hospital and conducted a research programme at the Institute of Child Health. Barratt was later joined by [[Richard Trompeter (Paediatric Nephrologist)|Richard Trompeter]] and [[Lesley Rees (Paediatric Nephrologist)|Lesley Rees]] who continued the work of Barratt.<ref name=\"renal\"/>\n\nBarratt early in his career realized that collaboration was needed in developing an interdisciplinary care model for the treatment of children with renal diseases, eventually working closely with the paediatric urologists [[David Innes Williams]] and [[Philip G.

It was research into childhood [[Nephrotic syndrome]] and the [[Hemolytic-uremic syndrome]] that was his most notable work, particularly the biological roles played by [[atopy]], [[Membrane potential|membrane charge]] and [[Cytokine]] release. Barratt undertook a number of trials to determine the best treatments with patients with nephrotic symptoms. In 1970, Barratt conducted a trial with the [[Immunology|immunologist]] John Soothill, using [[cyclophosphamide]] treatment for [[nephrotic syndrome]]. Barratt tested the drugs [[Azathioprine]], [[Levamisole]] and [[Ciclosporin|cyclosporine A]] in subsequent trials, eventually working with paediatrician [[Michael Levin]] and others to study [[Pathogenesis|pathogenetic]] mechanisms involved in the syndrome, including e.g. [[Platelet-derived growth factor]] and [[Prostacyclin|prostacyclin inhibition]].<ref name=\"renal\"/> Levin who was Barratt's registrar at Great Ormond Street stated of Barratt, that:\n\n:''Clinically, Martin had the most wonderful clarity of thought\u2014making the most complex issues clear.

{"title_page": "List of dreams", "text_new": "{{Paranormal}}\nOn several occasions throughout history '''[[dreams]]''' have been credited for causing very important events. This includes problem-solving, decision-making, and apparent [[precognitive dreams|precognition while dreaming]]. These phenomena have been interpreted in various ways.\n\n==Notable dreams==\n{{Expand list|date=August 2008}}\n\n===Abraham Lincoln===  \n\nThree days prior to his assassination [[Abraham Lincoln]] related a prophetic dream he had to his wife and a few friends foreshadowing his death. According to the recollection of his loyal friend and confidant [[Ward Hill Lamon]], President Abraham Lincoln dreams on this night in 1865 of \u201cthe subdued sobs of mourners\". Walking from room to room he noticed a corpse lying on a [[catafalque]] in the White House East Room. In the dream, Lincoln asked a soldier standing guard \u201cWho is dead in the White House?\u201d to which the soldier replied, \u201cThe President. He was killed by an assassin.\u201d Lincoln jumped out of bed at that point on April 11. Ten days after his vivid nightmare, Lincoln was shot dead at point blank range by an assassin [[John Wilkes Booth]] while attending the theater.<ref>https://www.dreamdictionary.org/dreaming/abraham-lincoln-predicted-his-death/</ref>\n\n===Frankenstein===\n[[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]'' was inspired by a dream:\n{{quote|\"I saw the pale student of unhallowed arts kneeling beside the thing he had put together. I saw the hideous phantasm of a man stretched out, and then, on the working of some powerful engine, show signs of life, and stir with an uneasy, half-vital motion. Frightful must it be; for supremely frightful would be the effect of any human endeavor to mock the stupendous Creator of the world.\"{{ref|shel}}}}\n\n===Kubla Khan===\n[[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] wrote ''[[Kubla Khan]]'' upon awakening from an opium-influenced dream. In a preface to the work, he described having the poem come to him, fully formed, in his dream. When he woke, he immediately set to writing it down, but was interrupted by a visitor and could not remember the final lines. For this reason, he kept it unpublished for many years.\n\n===The sewing machine===\n[[Elias Howe]] invented the [[sewing machine]] in 1845. He had the idea of a machine with a needle which would go through a piece of cloth but he couldn't figure out exactly how it would work. In his dream, cannibals were preparing to cook him and they were dancing around the fire waving their spears. Howe noticed at the head of each spear there was a small hole through the shaft and the up-and-down motion of the spears and the hole remained with him when he woke. The idea of passing the thread through the needle close to the point, not at the other end, was a major innovation in making mechanical sewing possible. {{ref|sew}}\n\n===The Terminator===\nDirector [[James Cameron]] said the titular character in ''[[The Terminator]]'' was inspired by a dream he had under the influence of a soaring [[fever]]. It was a vivid dream where a gleaming figure of doom emerged from fire; a metallic, skeletal monster with a rictus smile and burning red eyes, dragging itself across the floor with [[kitchen knives]]. He states: \"I was sick and dead broke in [[Rome]], [[Italy]], with a fever of 102, doing the final cut of [[Piranha II]]. That's when I thought of Terminator. I guess it was a fever dream.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.terminatorfiles.com/media/articles/cameron_001.htm |title=James Cameron - How to direct a 'Terminator' |publisher=Terminatorfiles.com |date=2012-04-24 |accessdate=2014-08-25}}</ref>\n\n===Descartes' new science===\n[[Descartes]] claimed that the dreams that he had on November 10, 1619, revealed to him the basis of a new philosophy, [[the scientific method]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n===Benzene===\nThe scientist [[Friedrich August Kekul\u00e9 von Stradonitz|Friedrich August Kekul\u00e9]] discovered the seemingly impossible chemical structure of [[benzene]] (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>) when he had a dream of a group of snakes swallowing their tails.{{ref|kekul}}\n\n===Double Helix structure of DNA===\nNobel laureate [[James Watson]] opens [[TED (conference)|TED]] 2005 with the frank and funny story of how he and his research partner, [[Francis Crick]], discovered the structure of DNA.

This includes problem-solving, decision-making, and apparent [[precognitive dreams|precognition while dreaming]]. These phenomena have been interpreted in various ways.\n\n==Notable dreams==\n{{Expand list|date=August 2008}}\n\n===Abraham Lincoln===  \n\nThree days prior to his assassination [[Abraham Lincoln]] related a prophetic dream he had to his wife and a few friends foreshadowing his death. According to the recollection of his loyal friend and confidant [[Ward Hill Lamon]], President Abraham Lincoln dreams on this night in 1865 of \u201cthe subdued sobs of mourners\". Walking from room to room he noticed a corpse lying on a [[catafalque]] in the White House East Room. In the dream, Lincoln asked a soldier standing guard \u201cWho is dead in the White House?\u201d to which the soldier replied, \u201cThe President. He was killed by an assassin.\u201d Lincoln jumped out of bed at that point on April 11. Ten days after his vivid nightmare, Lincoln was shot dead at point blank range by an assassin [[John Wilkes Booth]] while attending the theater.<ref>https://www.dreamdictionary.org/dreaming/abraham-lincoln-predicted-his-death/</ref>\n\n===Frankenstein===\n[[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]'' was inspired by a dream:\n{{quote|\"I saw the pale student of unhallowed arts kneeling beside the thing he had put together. I saw the hideous phantasm of a man stretched out, and then, on the working of some powerful engine, show signs of life, and stir with an uneasy, half-vital motion. Frightful must it be; for supremely frightful would be the effect of any human endeavor to mock the stupendous Creator of the world.\"{{ref|shel}}}}\n\n===Kubla Khan===\n[[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] wrote ''[[Kubla Khan]]'' upon awakening from an opium-influenced dream. In a preface to the work, he described having the poem come to him, fully formed, in his dream. When he woke, he immediately set to writing it down, but was interrupted by a visitor and could not remember the final lines. For this reason, he kept it unpublished for many years.\n\n===The sewing machine===\n[[Elias Howe]] invented the [[sewing machine]] in 1845. He had the idea of a machine with a needle which would go through a piece of cloth but he couldn't figure out exactly how it would work. In his dream, cannibals were preparing to cook him and they were dancing around the fire waving their spears. Howe noticed at the head of each spear there was a small hole through the shaft and the up-and-down motion of the spears and the hole remained with him when he woke. The idea of passing the thread through the needle close to the point, not at the other end, was a major innovation in making mechanical sewing possible. {{ref|sew}}\n\n===The Terminator===\nDirector [[James Cameron]] said the titular character in ''[[The Terminator]]'' was inspired by a dream he had under the influence of a soaring [[fever]]. It was a vivid dream where a gleaming figure of doom emerged from fire; a metallic, skeletal monster with a rictus smile and burning red eyes, dragging itself across the floor with [[kitchen knives]]. He states: \"I was sick and dead broke in [[Rome]], [[Italy]], with a fever of 102, doing the final cut of [[Piranha II]]. That's when I thought of Terminator. I guess it was a fever dream.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.terminatorfiles.com/media/articles/cameron_001.htm |title=James Cameron - How to direct a 'Terminator' |publisher=Terminatorfiles.com |date=2012-04-24 |accessdate=2014-08-25}}</ref>\n\n===Descartes' new science===\n[[Descartes]] claimed that the dreams that he had on November 10, 1619, revealed to him the basis of a new philosophy, [[the scientific method]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n===Benzene===\nThe scientist [[Friedrich August Kekul\u00e9 von Stradonitz|Friedrich August Kekul\u00e9]] discovered the seemingly impossible chemical structure of [[benzene]] (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>) when he had a dream of a group of snakes swallowing their tails.{{ref|kekul}}\n\n===Double Helix structure of DNA===\nNobel laureate [[James Watson]] opens [[TED (conference)|TED]] 2005 with the frank and funny story of how he and his research partner, [[Francis Crick]], discovered the structure of DNA.
