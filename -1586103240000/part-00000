It is located south of [[Lake Erie]] and includes [[Cattaraugus Reservation, Chautauqua County, New York|a small portion]] of the [[Cattaraugus Reservation]] of the Seneca.\n\n==History==\nMost of Chautauqua County was held by the [[Erie people]] prior to the [[Beaver Wars]] in the 1650s. French forces traversed the territory beginning in 1615. The [[Seneca Nation of New York|Seneca Nation]] conquered the territory during the Beaver Wars and held it through the next century until siding with the British crown, their allies for most of the 18th century, against the American revolutionaries in the [[American Revolutionary War]].\n\nChautauqua County was organized by the state legislature during the development of [[western New York]] after the [[American Revolutionary War]].  It was officially separated from [[Genesee County, New York|Genesee County]] on March 11, 1808.<ref>'''New York. ''Laws of New York.''''';31st Session; Chapter 40; Sections1\u20142; Page 266.</ref> This partition was performed under the same terms that produced [[Cattaraugus County, New York|Cattaraugus]] and [[Niagara County, New York|Niagara]] counties. The partition was done for political purposes, but the counties were not properly organized for self-government, so they were all administered as part of [[Niagara County, New York|Niagara County]].\n\nOn February 9, 1811, Chautauqua was completely organized, and its separate government was launched.<ref>Doty, William J., et al. '';Historic Annals of Southwestern New York.''; 3 Volumes; [[New York (state)|New York]]: Lewis Historical Publishing Company; 1940; Volume 1; Page 360.</ref> This established Chautauqua as a county of 1,100 square miles (2,850 square km) of land. Chautauqua has not been altered since.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|1500|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|1060|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|440|sqmi}} (29%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_36.txt |title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files |date=August 22, 2012 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140519062322/http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_36.txt |archive-date=May 19, 2014 |access-date=January 3, 2015}}</ref>\n\nChautauqua County, in the southwestern corner of New York State, along the New York-[[Pennsylvania]] border, is the westernmost of New York's counties. [[Chautauqua Lake]] is located in the center of the county, and [[Lake Erie]] is its northern border.\n\nPart of the [[Eastern Continental Divide]] runs through Chautauqua County. The area that drains into the [[Conewango Creek]] (including Chautauqua Lake) eventually empties into the Gulf of Mexico; the rest of the county's watershed empties into Lake Erie and via Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence Seaway into the North Atlantic Ocean. This divide, known as the '''Chautauqua Ridge''', can be used to mark the border between the [[Southern Tier]] and the [[Niagara Frontier]]. It is also a significant dividing point in the county's [[geopolitics]], with the \"North County\" being centered on Dunkirk and the \"South County\" centered on Jamestown each having their own interests.<ref>Dean, Nicholas (2009-08-30).

The entire county is within the bounds of [[New York's 23rd congressional district]] (served by [[Tom Reed (politician)|Tom Reed]]) and the [[New York State Senate]] 57th district (served by [[George Borrello]]). Prior to 2013, the county was part of [[New York's 27th congressional district]].  Prior to 2003, the county was part of [[New York's 31st congressional district]] (now the 29th), but was controversially redistricted out of that district and into what was the 27th, and was replaced in the 29th district by Rochester suburbs that had never before been part of the district. Chautauqua County, at the same time, joined [[Southtowns|southern Erie County]] and portions of the City of Buffalo in the 27th, areas that had also never been in the same district with each other. In both cases, the suburban additions were significantly more Democratic populations than the rural 31st was, leading to Democrats winning both portions of the divided territory and accusations of cracking-based [[gerrymandering]]. The 2012 redistricting process moved all of Chautauqua County into Goodell's assembly district, while the county also rejoined the former 31st (renumbered the 23rd) congressional district along with Cattaraugus and Allegany Counties.\n\nThere are an even number of registered Democrats and Republicans in Chautaqua County.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://buffalonews.com/2017/04/11/party-registration-figures-make-chautauqua-official-toss/ |title=Democrats, Republicans are a 50-50 split in Chautauqua County |last=McCarthy |first=Robert |date=11 April 2017 |website=The Buffalo News |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170412143104/http://buffalonews.com/2017/04/11/party-registration-figures-make-chautauqua-official-toss/ |archive-date=12 April 2017 |access-date=11 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n{{Hidden begin\n|titlestyle = background:#ccccff;\n|title      = Presidential election results\n}}\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''Presidential elections results'''<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS |title=Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections |last=Leip |first=David |website=uselectionatlas.org |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180323225526/https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/ |archive-date=23 March 2018 |access-date=1 May 2018}}</ref>\n|- bgcolor=lightgrey\n!

The partition was done for political purposes, but the counties were not properly organized for self-government, so they were all administered as part of [[Niagara County, New York|Niagara County]].\n\nOn February 9, 1811, Chautauqua was completely organized, and its separate government was launched.<ref>Doty, William J., et al.

The area that drains into the [[Conewango Creek]] (including Chautauqua Lake) eventually empties into the Gulf of Mexico; the rest of the county's watershed empties into Lake Erie and via Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence Seaway into the North Atlantic Ocean. This divide, known as the '''Chautauqua Ridge''', can be used to mark the border between the [[Southern Tier]] and the [[Niagara Frontier]].

The entire county is within the bounds of [[New York's 23rd congressional district]] (served by [[Tom Reed (politician)|Tom Reed]]) and the [[New York State Senate]] 57th district (served by [[George Borrello]]). Prior to 2013, the county was part of [[New York's 27th congressional district]].  Prior to 2003, the county was part of [[New York's 31st congressional district]] (now the 29th), but was controversially redistricted out of that district and into what was the 27th, and was replaced in the 29th district by Rochester suburbs that had never before been part of the district. Chautauqua County, at the same time, joined [[Southtowns|southern Erie County]] and portions of the City of Buffalo in the 27th, areas that had also never been in the same district with each other. In both cases, the suburban additions were significantly more Democratic populations than the rural 31st was, leading to Democrats winning both portions of the divided territory and accusations of cracking-based [[gerrymandering]]. The 2012 redistricting process moved all of Chautauqua County into Goodell's assembly district, while the county also rejoined the former 31st (renumbered the 23rd) congressional district along with Cattaraugus and Allegany Counties.\n\nThere are an even number of registered Democrats and Republicans in Chautaqua County.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://buffalonews.com/2017/04/11/party-registration-figures-make-chautauqua-official-toss/ |title=Democrats, Republicans are a 50-50 split in Chautauqua County |last=McCarthy |first=Robert |date=11 April 2017 |website=The Buffalo News |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170412143104/http://buffalonews.com/2017/04/11/party-registration-figures-make-chautauqua-official-toss/ |archive-date=12 April 2017 |access-date=11 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n{{Hidden begin\n|titlestyle = background:#ccccff;\n|title      = Presidential election results\n}}\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''Presidential elections results'''<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS |title=Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections |last=Leip |first=David |website=uselectionatlas.org |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180323225526/https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/ |archive-date=23 March 2018 |access-date=1 May 2018}}</ref>\n|- bgcolor=lightgrey\n!

The [[Sanskrit]] term ''k\u1e63atriya\u1e25'' is used in the context of [[Vedic]] society wherein members were organised into four classes: ''[[brahmin]]'', kshatriya, ''[[vaishya]]'' and ''[[shudra]]''. Later due to poverty were imposed with the present caste.\n\n2. They were into music and few had even served in the Mughal darbars.(Akbar)\n\n3. They were also deployed into the mughal army and which led them to join the British Indian Army.\n\n4. They were also a part of the indo burmese war and few joined the INA under the leadership Netaji Subhas Chandra bose. Thus presently few are serving in the Indian defence         forces at present. \n\n5. They are a big devotee of Lord Shiva (''Mahadev'').\n\nThe Hela are a community of agricultural labourers. Their traditional occupation was that of a village sweeper.
