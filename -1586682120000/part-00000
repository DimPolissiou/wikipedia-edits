June 9), 1730) is one of the most renowned saints in the [[Greek Orthodox Church]]. Being a prisoner of war and a slave to a Turkish [[Agha (Ottoman Empire)|Agha]], he became famous and respected even by his [[Muslim]] master for his humility, steadiness in faith and benevolence. His holy relics are undecayed and wonder-working; there are traditions that this saint particularly helps sick children and those who suffer from [[cancer]].\n\n==Life==\n===Youth===\nSt. John the Russian was born approximately in 1690 in [[Ukraine]]. Having come of age, he was recruited to the army of [[Peter the Great]] and took part in the [[Russo-Turkish War (1710\u20131711)]]. During the war, he was captured prisoner and sold to slavery to the head of Turkish cavalry.\n\n===Life in slavery===\nThe saint refused to adopt [[Islam]] and was humiliated and tormented for that by the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]], who called him a [[kafir]], which means \"unbeliever\". But as the time went by, the mockery had stopped due to saint's steadiness in faith, humility and diligence, and saint John became respected by his master and the household. He worked as a groom and lived in the stables. Other slaves mocked him for the zeal he was working with, but the pious man took no offence, trying to help them in their needs and comforting them when needed. For his sincere kind-heartedness, the saint had earned love and trust of the Agha who proposed him to live as a free man, in separate house. But he refused, saying: \"My patron is Lord, and no one is above Him. He predestined me to live as a slave in a foreign land; seems, it must be so for my salvation\".\n\nIn the daytime John worked and prayed, keeping strict fast, and when the night came, he used to secretly go to the cave-church of [[St. George]], where he said the prayers of [[All-Night Vigil]]. Every Saturday he used to take the [[Holy Communion]].\n\nSoon the Agha became rich and one of the most influential people in [[Urgup]]. He decided, that it is due to the holy man, who lives in his home. Having become rich, the Agha decided to carry out the [[Hajj]]. During this travel, his wife was giving a dinner to the relatives and friends. When the master's favourite dish, [[pilau]] was being served, she told John, who was waiting upon the table: \"How glad would your master be, if he could eat this pilau with us\". The saint asked her to give him this dish, promising to send it to [[Mecca]]. Everybody was laughing, but John's request was complied, they decided he wanted to eat pilau himself or give it to the poor.\n\nWhen the Agha came back, he told about the miracle that had happened to him: while being in Mecca, he found a fuming plate of pilau in his locked room. And on this plate his name was engraved - as on every plate in his home.\n\n===Beginning of reverence===\nNews of this miracle spread quickly, and everyone, even [[Muslims]], began to call John a \"[[Wali]]\" - a \"saint\". However, he did not change the way he lived, and spent time doing hard work and praying. Before his death, he became seriously ill and, having no ability to stand up, asked for a priest to give him Holy Communion. The priest was afraid to openly go to a Muslim house and hid the [[Eucharist]] inside an apple. John the Russian died on June 9, 1730, some time after receiving the Holy Communion.\n\n==Holy places worth visiting==\nThe [[relics]] of saint John are in Church of Saint John the Russian in <ref>Neo Prokopion {{coord|38|44|13.44|N|23|29|23.79|E|type:city}}</ref> ([[Prokopi]]) in [[Euboea]], [[Greece]]. His right hand is in Russian [[Monastery of St Panteleimon]] on [[Mount Athos|Athos]].

June 9), 1730) is one of the most renowned saints in the [[Greek Orthodox Church]]. Being a prisoner of war and a slave to a Turkish [[Agha (Ottoman Empire)|Agha]], he became famous and respected even by his [[Muslim]] master for his humility, steadiness in faith and benevolence. His holy relics are undecayed and wonder-working; there are traditions that this saint particularly helps sick children and those who suffer from [[cancer]].\n\n==Life==\n===Youth===\nSt. John the Russian was born approximately in 1690 in [[Ukraine]]. Having come of age, he was recruited to the army of [[Peter the Great]] and took part in the [[Russo-Turkish War (1710\u20131711)]]. During the war, he was captured prisoner and sold to slavery to the head of Turkish cavalry.\n\n===Life in slavery===\nThe saint refused to adopt [[Islam]] and was humiliated and tormented for that by the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]], who called him a [[kafir]], which means \"unbeliever\". But as the time went by, the mockery had stopped due to saint's steadiness in faith, humility and diligence, and saint John became respected by his master and the household. He worked as a groom and lived in the stables. Other slaves mocked him for the zeal he was working with, but the pious man took no offence, trying to help them in their needs and comforting them when needed. For his sincere kind-heartedness, the saint had earned love and trust of the Agha who proposed him to live as a free man, in separate house. But he refused, saying: \"My patron is Lord, and no one is above Him. He predestined me to live as a slave in a foreign land; seems, it must be so for my salvation\".\n\nIn the daytime John worked and prayed, keeping strict fast, and when the night came, he used to secretly go to the cave-church of [[St. George]], where he said the prayers of [[All-Night Vigil]]. Every Saturday he used to take the [[Holy Communion]].\n\nSoon the Agha became rich and one of the most influential people in [[Urgup]]. He decided, that it is due to the holy man, who lives in his home. Having become rich, the Agha decided to carry out the [[Hajj]]. During this travel, his wife was giving a dinner to the relatives and friends. When the master's favourite dish, [[pilau]] was being served, she told John, who was waiting upon the table: \"How glad would your master be, if he could eat this pilau with us\". The saint asked her to give him this dish, promising to send it to [[Mecca]]. Everybody was laughing, but John's request was complied, they decided he wanted to eat pilau himself or give it to the poor.\n\nWhen the Agha came back, he told about the miracle that had happened to him: while being in Mecca, he found a fuming plate of pilau in his locked room. And on this plate his name was engraved - as on every plate in his home.\n\n===Beginning of reverence===\nNews of this miracle spread quickly, and everyone, even [[Muslims]], began to call John a \"[[Wali]]\" - a \"saint\". However, he did not change the way he lived, and spent time doing hard work and praying. Before his death, he became seriously ill and, having no ability to stand up, asked for a priest to give him Holy Communion. The priest was afraid to openly go to a Muslim house and hid the [[Eucharist]] inside an apple. John the Russian died on June 9, 1730, some time after receiving the Holy Communion.\n\n==Holy places worth visiting==\nThe [[relics]] of saint John are in Church of Saint John the Russian in <ref>Neo Prokopion {{coord|38|44|13.44|N|23|29|23.79|E|type:city}}</ref> ([[Prokopi]]) in [[Euboea]], [[Greece]].

Many palaces and churches were built by the most important architects of the time, such as [[Raffaello Sanzio]] and [[Antonio da Sangallo the Younger]], who often chose to move into the street. They were joined by several noble families, while European nations and Italian city-states chose to build their churches in the street or in the immediate vicinity.\n\nIn the [[Baroque|Baroque period]] the building activity, directed by the most important architects of the time such as [[Francesco Borromini]], [[Carlo Maderno]] and [[Giacomo della Porta]], continued unabated, while the street, favorite location of the Roman nobles, became the theatre of tournaments, parties and carnival parades. During this period the popes and private patrons continued to take care of the road by founding charitable institutions and providing the area with drinking water.\n\nFrom the middle of the 18th century, the shift of the city centre towards the [[Campo Marzio]] caused the stop of building activity and the abandonment of the road by the nobles. These were replaced by an artisan population with its workshops, and Via Giulia took on the solitary and solemn aspect that would have characterized it for two centuries. During the [[Fascist era|Fascist period]] some construction projects broke the unity of the road in its central section, and the damage has not yet been repaired. Despite this, Via Giulia remains one of Rome's richest roads in art and history, and after a two-century decline, from the 1950s onwards the road's fame was renewed to be one of the city's most prestigious locations.\n\n==Location==\nVia Giulia runs along the left (east) bank of the [[Tiber]] from ''Piazza San Vincenzo Pallotti'', near [[Ponte Sisto]], to ''Piazza dell'Oro''. It is about 1 kilometre long and connects the [[Regola]] and [[Ponte (rione of Rome)|Ponte]] [[rioni of Rome|Rioni]].\n\n==Denominations==\nThe road was named after its patron, [[Pope Julius II]] [[della Rovere]] (r. 1503-1513), who ordered its construction in 1508.<ref name=bramanteDbi/><ref name=del472>Delli (1988), p. 472</ref> It had been also called {{Lang|la|Via Magistralis}} (lit. \"master road\") because of its importance,<ref name=del472/> and {{Lang|la|Via Recta}} (lit. \"straight road\") because of its layout.<ref name=del473/>\n\n==History==\nThe area of the ancient {{Lang|la|[[Campus Martius]]}} developed into one of the most densely populated districts (''abitato'') of Rome since the early [[Middle Ages]]. The maze of narrow alleys was criss-crossed by three narrow thoroughfares: the {{Lang|la|Via Papalis}} (lit. \"papal road\"),<ref>Today's ''Via dei Banchi Nuovi'' - ''via del Governo Vecchio'' - ''piazza di Pasquino'' - ''piazza di S.Pantaleo''  - ''piazza d'Aracoeli'' - ''Campidoglio'' - ''Stradone di S.Giovanni''</ref> the {{Lang|la|Via Peregrinorum}} (lit. \"pilgrims' road\") <ref>Today's ''Via dei Banchi Vecchi'' - ''Via del Pellegrino'' - ''via dei Giubbonari''</ref> and the {{Lang|la|Via Recta}} (lit. \"straight road\", a name common to many roads in medieval Rome).<ref>Today's ''[[via dei Coronari]]''</ref><ref name=tem57>Temple(2011), p. 57</ref> [[Procession]]s travelled through these streets almost daily during the [[Middle Ages]] to the [[Ponte Sant'Angelo|Angels' Bridge]]. As [[Dante Alighieri]] described in the [[Divine Comedy]], in 1300, [[Pope Boniface VIII]] (r. 1294-1303) ordered a two-way traffic system to be set up to avoid traffic jams or panic as a response to the dense crowds on Angels' Bridge.<ref>Dante Aligheri: Inferno, canto XVIII, vv. 28\u20133\u20133</ref> After [[Pope Martin V]] (r. 1417-1431) [[Western_Schism#Resolution|returned]] to Rome in 1420, the influx of pilgrims increased significantly again, especially in the [[Jubilee]] years. On 29 December 1450, the last day of the Holy Year, a [[stampede]] broke out on the bridge that killed more than 300 people.<ref name=gi9038>Gigli (1990) p. 38</ref><ref name=gi9040>Gigli (1990) p. 40</ref>\nAs a result of the catastrophe, [[Pope Nicholas V]] (r. 1447-1455) ordered the Angels' Bridge to be cleared of stalls and shops and the first urban planning measures in the area were initiated. In 1475, [[Pope Sixtus IV]] (r. 1471-1484) ordered the [[Ponte Sisto]], named after him, to be built across the [[Tiber]] [[:File:Ponte Sisto Bauinschrift 1475.jpg|(inscription)]] in order to relieve the pilgrimage route across the Angels' Bridge and to connect the ''rioni'' of [[Regola]] and [[Trastevere]].<ref name=pie7982>Pietrangeli (1979), p. 82</ref> At the same time he ordered the restoration of ''Via Pelegrinorum'' and the area around the ''[[Campo de' Fiori]]'' [[:File:Via Florea Stadterneuerung.jpg|(inscription)]]. According to the chronicler [[Stefano Infessura]], however, strategic reasons aside from reducing traffic were also important for these projects.<ref>Stefano Infessura: ''Diario Rerum Romanorum''; Roma 1890 p. 79 f.: February 1475</ref> In 1497 [[Pope Alexander VI]] (r. 1492-1503) ordered the widening of ''Via Peregrinorum'' <ref>Inscription at the entrance to the Via del Pellegrino: ALEX VI PONT MAX POST INSTAURATAM ADRIANI MOLEM ANGUSTAS VRBIS VIAS AMMPLIARI IVSSIT MCCCCLXXXXVII (''Alexander VI.

Via Curato-Banchi.jpg|thumb|Inscription by Julius II, 1512]]\nIn addition to reconstructing [[St. Peter's Basilica]], Julius II implemented multiple projects in the framework of Rome's [[urban renewal]] (''Renovatio Romae'') in the [[Ponte (rione of Rome)|Ponte]], [[Parione]], [[Sant'Eustachio (rione of Rome)|Sant'Eustachio]] and [[Colonna (rione of Rome)|Colonna]] ''[[Rioni of Rome|rioni]]'', a task which was started forty years before by his uncle, [[Pope Sixtus IV]] (r. 1471-1484).<ref name=cast378>Castagnoli (1958), pp.378</ref> One of the most important projects was the creation of two new straight streets on the left and right banks of the Tiber: the Via Giulia on the left bank, a new grand avenue through the most densely populated quarter of Rome, from the [[Ponte Sisto]] to the Florentine merchant quarter on the [[Tiber]] bend,<ref name=pie798>Pietrangeli(1979) p. 8</ref> and a straight road along the right bank of the Tiber from the [[Porta Settimiana]] in [[Trastevere]] to the [[Ospedale di Santo Spirito in Sassia|Hospital of Santo Spirito]] in the [[Borgo (rione of Rome)|Borgo]], the ''Via della Lungara''.<ref name=cast38081>Castagnoli (1958), pp.380-381</ref>\nBoth roads flanked the Tiber and were closely connected to it.<ref name=\"po19\"/> The Lungara had the dual aim to relieve the pilgrimage route to Saint Peter<ref name=cast38081/> and transport goods coming from the ''[[Via Aurelia]]'' and the ''[[Via Portuensis|via Portuense]]'' roads towards the centre of the city. The Pope intended for it to reach ''Piazza di [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]]'' and the [[Port of Ripa Grande and Papal Arsenal|port of ''Ripa Grande'']].<ref name=\"po19\"/>\n\nThe main goal behind these plans was to superimpose a regular road network with the focus given to the Tiber by medieval Rome's disorderly buildings; together with the new ''[[Borgo Nuovo (Rome)|Via Alessandrina]]'' that Alexander VI opened in the Borgo, the ''Via dei Pettinari'' that connected the [[Trastevere]] on one side and the [[Campidoglio]] on the other, the ''Lungara'' and Via Giulia created a quadrilateral network of modern roads in the city's maze of alleys.<ref name=\"po19\"/> In the original project Via Giulia was supposed to reach the Hospital of Santo Spirito in [[Borgo (rione of Rome)|Borgo]] via the rebuilt ''[[Pons Neronianus]]''.<ref name=del472/><ref name=cast380>Castagnoli (1958), pp.380</ref> The center of the city shifted towards the Vatican and [[Trastevere]] and away from the [[Palazzo Senatorio]] on the [[Capitoline Hill]], which was the symbol of the Roman nobility's power;<ref name=tem124/><ref name=\"po19\"/> the plan was intended to separate the papacy from the city's powerful noble families, particularly the [[Orsini family|Orsini]] and [[Colonna family|Colonna]] families.<ref name=tem124>Temple (2011), pp. 124</ref>\n\nThese projects had a secondary, celebrative goal to promote the [[Pontiff]] as the unifier of Italy and the renewer of Rome; in 1506, after the end of the [[Plague (disease)|plague]], the Pope overthrew the powerful [[Baglioni (family)|Baglioni]] and [[Bentivoglio family|Bentivoglio]] families and conquered [[Perugia]] and [[Bologna]],<ref name=\"po19\">Portoghesi, p. 19</ref> as testified in an inscription along the ''Via dei Banchi Nuovi''.<ref>IVLIO.II.PONT:OPT:MAX:QVOD FINIB:DITIONIS.S.R.E.PROLATIS ITALIAQ:LIBERATA VRBEM ROMAM OCCVPATE SIMILIOREM QVAM DIVISE PATEFACTIS DIMENSIS Q: VIIS PRO MAIESTATE IMPERII ORNAVIT (''Julius II p.o.m. who extended the power of the Holy Roman Church and freed Italy.

Many palaces and churches were built by the most important architects of the time, such as [[Raffaello Sanzio]] and [[Antonio da Sangallo the Younger]], who often chose to move into the street. They were joined by several noble families, while European nations and Italian city-states chose to build their churches in the street or in the immediate vicinity.\n\nIn the [[Baroque|Baroque period]] the building activity, directed by the most important architects of the time such as [[Francesco Borromini]], [[Carlo Maderno]] and [[Giacomo della Porta]], continued unabated, while the street, favorite location of the Roman nobles, became the theatre of tournaments, parties and carnival parades. During this period the popes and private patrons continued to take care of the road by founding charitable institutions and providing the area with drinking water.\n\nFrom the middle of the 18th century, the shift of the city centre towards the [[Campo Marzio]] caused the stop of building activity and the abandonment of the road by the nobles. These were replaced by an artisan population with its workshops, and Via Giulia took on the solitary and solemn aspect that would have characterized it for two centuries. During the [[Fascist era|Fascist period]] some construction projects broke the unity of the road in its central section, and the damage has not yet been repaired. Despite this, Via Giulia remains one of Rome's richest roads in art and history, and after a two-century decline, from the 1950s onwards the road's fame was renewed to be one of the city's most prestigious locations.\n\n==Location==\nVia Giulia runs along the left (east) bank of the [[Tiber]] from ''Piazza San Vincenzo Pallotti'', near [[Ponte Sisto]], to ''Piazza dell'Oro''. It is about 1 kilometre long and connects the [[Regola]] and [[Ponte (rione of Rome)|Ponte]] [[rioni of Rome|Rioni]].\n\n==Denominations==\nThe road was named after its patron, [[Pope Julius II]] [[della Rovere]] (r. 1503-1513), who ordered its construction in 1508.<ref name=bramanteDbi/><ref name=del472>Delli (1988), p. 472</ref> It had been also called {{Lang|la|Via Magistralis}} (lit. \"master road\") because of its importance,<ref name=del472/> and {{Lang|la|Via Recta}} (lit. \"straight road\") because of its layout.<ref name=del473/>\n\n==History==\nThe area of the ancient {{Lang|la|[[Campus Martius]]}} developed into one of the most densely populated districts (''abitato'') of Rome since the early [[Middle Ages]]. The maze of narrow alleys was criss-crossed by three narrow thoroughfares: the {{Lang|la|Via Papalis}} (lit. \"papal road\"),<ref>Today's ''Via dei Banchi Nuovi'' - ''via del Governo Vecchio'' - ''piazza di Pasquino'' - ''piazza di S.Pantaleo''  - ''piazza d'Aracoeli'' - ''Campidoglio'' - ''Stradone di S.Giovanni''</ref> the {{Lang|la|Via Peregrinorum}} (lit. \"pilgrims' road\") <ref>Today's ''Via dei Banchi Vecchi'' - ''Via del Pellegrino'' - ''via dei Giubbonari''</ref> and the {{Lang|la|Via Recta}} (lit. \"straight road\", a name common to many roads in medieval Rome).<ref>Today's ''[[via dei Coronari]]''</ref><ref name=tem57>Temple(2011), p. 57</ref> [[Procession]]s travelled through these streets almost daily during the [[Middle Ages]] to the [[Ponte Sant'Angelo|Angels' Bridge]]. As [[Dante Alighieri]] described in the [[Divine Comedy]], in 1300, [[Pope Boniface VIII]] (r. 1294-1303) ordered a two-way traffic system to be set up to avoid traffic jams or panic as a response to the dense crowds on Angels' Bridge.<ref>Dante Aligheri: Inferno, canto XVIII, vv. 28\u20133\u20133</ref> After [[Pope Martin V]] (r. 1417-1431) [[Western_Schism#Resolution|returned]] to Rome in 1420, the influx of pilgrims increased significantly again, especially in the [[Jubilee]] years. On 29 December 1450, the last day of the Holy Year, a [[stampede]] broke out on the bridge that killed more than 300 people.<ref name=gi9038>Gigli (1990) p. 38</ref><ref name=gi9040>Gigli (1990) p. 40</ref>\nAs a result of the catastrophe, [[Pope Nicholas V]] (r. 1447-1455) ordered the Angels' Bridge to be cleared of stalls and shops and the first urban planning measures in the area were initiated. In 1475, [[Pope Sixtus IV]] (r. 1471-1484) ordered the [[Ponte Sisto]], named after him, to be built across the [[Tiber]] [[:File:Ponte Sisto Bauinschrift 1475.jpg|(inscription)]] in order to relieve the pilgrimage route across the Angels' Bridge and to connect the ''rioni'' of [[Regola]] and [[Trastevere]].<ref name=pie7982>Pietrangeli (1979), p. 82</ref> At the same time he ordered the restoration of ''Via Pelegrinorum'' and the area around the ''[[Campo de' Fiori]]'' [[:File:Via Florea Stadterneuerung.jpg|(inscription)]]. According to the chronicler [[Stefano Infessura]], however, strategic reasons aside from reducing traffic were also important for these projects.<ref>Stefano Infessura: ''Diario Rerum Romanorum''; Roma 1890 p. 79 f.: February 1475</ref> In 1497 [[Pope Alexander VI]] (r. 1492-1503) ordered the widening of ''Via Peregrinorum'' <ref>Inscription at the entrance to the Via del Pellegrino: ALEX VI PONT MAX POST INSTAURATAM ADRIANI MOLEM ANGUSTAS VRBIS VIAS AMMPLIARI IVSSIT MCCCCLXXXXVII (''Alexander VI.

Via Curato-Banchi.jpg|thumb|Inscription by Julius II, 1512]]\nIn addition to reconstructing [[St. Peter's Basilica]], Julius II implemented multiple projects in the framework of Rome's [[urban renewal]] (''Renovatio Romae'') in the [[Ponte (rione of Rome)|Ponte]], [[Parione]], [[Sant'Eustachio (rione of Rome)|Sant'Eustachio]] and [[Colonna (rione of Rome)|Colonna]] ''[[Rioni of Rome|rioni]]'', a task which was started forty years before by his uncle, [[Pope Sixtus IV]] (r. 1471-1484).<ref name=cast378>Castagnoli (1958), pp.378</ref> One of the most important projects was the creation of two new straight streets on the left and right banks of the Tiber: the Via Giulia on the left bank, a new grand avenue through the most densely populated quarter of Rome, from the [[Ponte Sisto]] to the Florentine merchant quarter on the [[Tiber]] bend,<ref name=pie798>Pietrangeli(1979) p. 8</ref> and a straight road along the right bank of the Tiber from the [[Porta Settimiana]] in [[Trastevere]] to the [[Ospedale di Santo Spirito in Sassia|Hospital of Santo Spirito]] in the [[Borgo (rione of Rome)|Borgo]], the ''Via della Lungara''.<ref name=cast38081>Castagnoli (1958), pp.380-381</ref>\nBoth roads flanked the Tiber and were closely connected to it.<ref name=\"po19\"/> The Lungara had the dual aim to relieve the pilgrimage route to Saint Peter<ref name=cast38081/> and transport goods coming from the ''[[Via Aurelia]]'' and the ''[[Via Portuensis|via Portuense]]'' roads towards the centre of the city.

The majority of citizens in Pacitan speak [[Javanese language | Javanese]] as their first language, while speaking [[Indonesian Language| Indonesian]] as a second language.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Watu Karung Beach Pacitan.JPG|thumb|300px|Watu Karung Beach, Pringkuku, Pacitan]]\n[[File:Klayar Beach, Pacitan 2009.jpg|thumb|300px|Klayar Beach, Donorojo, Pacitan]]\nThe area of Pacitan Regency is about 1,342.42&nbsp;km\u00b2. Most of it is mountainous and rocky, also having a few rocky canyons. That sort of geography covers about 88% of the regency, and this is because Pacitan is located in the [[Gunung Sewu|Thousand Mountains]]. The highest mountain in Pacitan is [[Mount Lima]] in [[Kebonagung]], and [[Mount Gembes]] in [[Bandar, Pacitan|Bandar]] as the spring of [[Grindulu River]].\n\nComparison of land types:\n*Flat (0 - 5% slope) = 53.7&nbsp;km\u00b2 (4%)\n*Bumpy (6 - 10% slope) = 134.24&nbsp;km\u00b2 (10%)\n*Wavy (11 - 30% slope) = 322.18&nbsp;km\u00b2 (24%)\n*Hilly (31 - 50% slope) = 698.06&nbsp;km\u00b2 (52%)\n*Mountainous (more than 51% slope) = 134.24&nbsp;km\u00b2 (10%)\n\nGenerally, the land in Pacitan can be divided into two categories, calcium rich in the south, and fertile land in the north. The land consists of lithosal association, red mediterranean lithosal, tuf and volcanic compound, reddish lithosal complex, and grey alluvial, clay sediments containing many potential minerals. The minerals are [[feldspar]], [[ball clay]], [[bentonite]], [[pyrophyllite]], [[calcite]], [[gypsum]], [[phosphate rock]], [[quartz]], [[coal]], [[Dolomite (mineral)|dolomite]], [[gemstone]]{{clarify|date=May 2016}}, [[tin ore]], and [[manganite]].\n\nPacitan Regency consists 130.87&nbsp;km\u00b2 of rice fields and 1,211.55&nbsp;km\u00b2 of dry land. According to irrigation type the rice fields can be grouped into: technical irrigation rice field (16.06&nbsp;km\u00b2), half technical irrigation rice field (11.88&nbsp;km\u00b2), simple irrigation rice field (40.63&nbsp;km\u00b2), and rain-dependent rice field (62.3&nbsp;km\u00b2).\n\n==Administrative divisions==\nPacitan Regency is divided into twelve [[Districts of Indonesia|districts]] (''kecamatan''):\n\n*Pacitan\n*Kebonagung\n*Arjosari\n*Tulakan\n*Ngadirojo\n*Punung\n*Pringkuku\n*Donorojo\n*Nawangan\n*Tegalombo\n*Sudimoro\n*Bandar\n\n==Beaches==\nPacitan Regency has 17 beaches, in the west of Pacitan City: Banyu Tibo, Buyutan, Karang Bolong, Srau, Klayar, and Watu Karung, near Pacitan City: Pantai Teleng Ria, Tamperan Gung, Kali Uluh, and Wawaran, in the east of Pacitan City: Pidakan, Soge, Tawang, Taman, and Kunir. All beaches are near 70 kilometers of South Coast Road from [[Wonogiri Regency]] to [[Trenggalek Regency]]. Soge Beach can be accessed in 30 minutes drive or by bus public transport from Pacitan City, but all beaches are relatively far from big cities as [[Surabaya]] (7 hours) and [[Surakarta]] (4 hours).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://travel.kompas.com/read/2014/08/13/152640727/Pantai.Soge.Keindahan.Pesisir.Pacitan |title=Pantai Soge, Keindahan Pesisir Pacitan |author=I Made Asdhiana |accessdate=November 29, 2014}}</ref> But, It is closer from Yogyakarta.\n\n== Tourism ==\nPacitan is known as the City of Tourism (Kota Parawisata) or City of a Thousand Caves (Kota Seribu Goa) because of ecological diversity and natural attractions.

Born in India to an [[Anglo-Irish]] family, Roberts joined the [[East India Company|East India Company Army]] and served as a young officer in the [[Indian rebellion of 1857|Indian Rebellion]] during which he won a [[Victoria Cross]] for gallantry. He was then transferred to the [[British Army]] and fought in the [[1868 Expedition to Abyssinia|Expedition to Abyssinia]] and the [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]], in which his exploits earned him widespread fame. Roberts would go on to serve as the [[Commander-in-Chief, India]] before leading British Forces to success in the [[Second Boer War]]. He also became the last [[Commander-in-Chief of the Forces]] before the post was abolished in 1904.\n\nA man of small stature, Roberts was affectionately known to his troops and the wider British public as \"Bobs\" and revered as one of Britain's leading military figures at a time when the [[British Empire]] reached the height of its power.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kiplingsociety.co.uk/poems_bobs.htm |title=Poems - 'Bobs' |publisher=Kiplingsociety.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2018-05-23}}</ref> He became a symbol for the British Army and in later life became an influential proponent of the increasing threat that the [[German Empire]] posed to Britain in the lead up to the [[First World War]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/90732968 |title=16 November 1914 - The late Lord Roberts. - Trove |publisher=Trove.nla.gov.au |date=1914-11-16 |accessdate=2018-05-23}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nBorn at [[Cawnpore]], India, on 30 September 1832, Roberts was the son of General [[Abraham Roberts|Sir Abraham Roberts]],<ref name=\"ODNB\">{{cite ODNB |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/35768 |title= Roberts, Frederick Sleigh, first Earl Roberts (1832\u20131914) |accessdate=25 February 2009 |last=Robson |first=Brian |year= 2008 |doi= 10.1093/ref:odnb/35768 }}</ref> a native of [[County Waterford]] in the south-east of [[Ireland]].<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> At the time Sir Abraham was commanding the [[1st Bengal European Regiment]].<ref>{{Cite news|title=ny times|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9801E7D91F31E132A25755C1A9679C94669ED7CF | work=The New York Times | date=16 January 1897 | accessdate=23 April 2010}}</ref> Roberts was named Sleigh in honour of the garrison commander, [[Major-general (United Kingdom)|Major General]] William Sleigh.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> His mother was [[Edinburgh]]-born Isabella Bunbury,<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> daughter of [[Major (United Kingdom)|Major]] Abraham Bunbury from Kilfeacle in [[County Tipperary]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.turtlebunbury.com/family/bunburyfamily_bunburys/bunbury_family_bunburys_kilfeacle.html |title=Bunbury of Kilfeacle Family History |publisher=Turtlebunbury.com |date= |accessdate=29 May 2011}}</ref>\n\nRoberts was educated at [[Eton College|Eton]],<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst|Sandhurst]],<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> and [[Addiscombe Military Seminary]]<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> before entering the [[East India Company|East India Company Army]] as a [[second lieutenant]] with the [[Bengal Army|Bengal Artillery]] on 12 December 1851.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> He became [[Aide-de-Camp]] to his father in 1852, transferred to the [[Bengal Army|Bengal Horse Artillery]] in 1854 and was promoted to [[Lieutenant (British Army and Royal Marines)|lieutenant]] on 31 May 1857.<ref name=Heath246>Heathcote, p. 246.</ref>\n\n==Indian Rebellion of 1857==\nRoberts fought in the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] seeing action during the [[Siege of Delhi|siege and capture of Delhi]] where he was slightly wounded,<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=22095|page=673|date=10 February 1858}}</ref> and being present at the [[Siege of Lucknow|relief of Lucknow]], where, as Deputy Assistant Quartermaster-General, he was attached to the staff of [[Colin Campbell, 1st Baron Clyde|Sir Colin Campbell]], [[Commander-in-Chief, India]].<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> He was awarded the [[Victoria Cross]] for actions on 2 January 1858 at [[Khudaganj]].<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> The citation reads:\n{{quote|Lieutenant Roberts' gallantry has on every occasion been most marked.<br/>\nOn following the retreating enemy on 2 January 1858, at Khodagunge, he saw in the distance two [[Sepoy]]s going away with a standard.

of the most successful British military commanders of his time. Born in India to an [[Anglo-Irish]] family, Roberts joined the [[East India Company|East India Company Army]] and served as a young officer in the [[Indian rebellion of 1857|Indian Rebellion]] during which he won a [[Victoria Cross]] for gallantry. He was then transferred to the [[British Army]] and fought in the [[1868 Expedition to Abyssinia|Expedition to Abyssinia]] and the [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]], in which his exploits earned him widespread fame. Roberts would go on to serve as the [[Commander-in-Chief, India]] before leading British Forces to success in the [[Second Boer War]]. He also became the last [[Commander-in-Chief of the Forces]] before the post was abolished in 1904.\n\nA man of small stature, Roberts was affectionately known to his troops and the wider British public as \"Bobs\" and revered as one of Britain's leading military figures at a time when the [[British Empire]] reached the height of its power.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kiplingsociety.co.uk/poems_bobs.htm |title=Poems - 'Bobs' |publisher=Kiplingsociety.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2018-05-23}}</ref> He became a symbol for the British Army and in later life became an influential proponent of the increasing threat that the [[German Empire]] posed to Britain in the lead up to the [[First World War]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/90732968 |title=16 November 1914 - The late Lord Roberts. - Trove |publisher=Trove.nla.gov.au |date=1914-11-16 |accessdate=2018-05-23}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nBorn at [[Cawnpore]], India, on 30 September 1832, Roberts was the son of General [[Abraham Roberts|Sir Abraham Roberts]],<ref name=\"ODNB\">{{cite ODNB |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/35768 |title= Roberts, Frederick Sleigh, first Earl Roberts (1832\u20131914) |accessdate=25 February 2009 |last=Robson |first=Brian |year= 2008 |doi= 10.1093/ref:odnb/35768 }}</ref> a native of [[County Waterford]] in the south-east of [[Ireland]].<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> At the time Sir Abraham was commanding the [[1st Bengal European Regiment]].<ref>{{Cite news|title=ny times|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9801E7D91F31E132A25755C1A9679C94669ED7CF | work=The New York Times | date=16 January 1897 | accessdate=23 April 2010}}</ref> Roberts was named Sleigh in honour of the garrison commander, [[Major-general (United Kingdom)|Major General]] William Sleigh.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> His mother was [[Edinburgh]]-born Isabella Bunbury,<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> daughter of [[Major (United Kingdom)|Major]] Abraham Bunbury from Kilfeacle in [[County Tipperary]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.turtlebunbury.com/family/bunburyfamily_bunburys/bunbury_family_bunburys_kilfeacle.html |title=Bunbury of Kilfeacle Family History |publisher=Turtlebunbury.com |date= |accessdate=29 May 2011}}</ref>\n\nRoberts was educated at [[Eton College|Eton]],<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst|Sandhurst]],<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> and [[Addiscombe Military Seminary]]<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> before entering the [[East India Company|East India Company Army]] as a [[second lieutenant]] with the [[Bengal Army|Bengal Artillery]] on 12 December 1851.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> He became [[Aide-de-Camp]] to his father in 1852, transferred to the [[Bengal Army|Bengal Horse Artillery]] in 1854 and was promoted to [[Lieutenant (British Army and Royal Marines)|lieutenant]] on 31 May 1857.<ref name=Heath246>Heathcote, p. 246.</ref>\n\n==Indian Rebellion of 1857==\nRoberts fought in the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] seeing action during the [[Siege of Delhi|siege and capture of Delhi]] where he was slightly wounded,<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=22095|page=673|date=10 February 1858}}</ref> and being present at the [[Siege of Lucknow|relief of Lucknow]], where, as Deputy Assistant Quartermaster-General, he was attached to the staff of [[Colin Campbell, 1st Baron Clyde|Sir Colin Campbell]], [[Commander-in-Chief, India]].<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> He was awarded the [[Victoria Cross]] for actions on 2 January 1858 at [[Khudaganj]].<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> The citation reads:\n{{quote|Lieutenant Roberts' gallantry has on every occasion been most marked.<br/>\nOn following the retreating enemy on 2 January 1858, at Khodagunge, he saw in the distance two [[Sepoy]]s going away with a standard.

H. Asquith|the Prime Minister]], urging him not to cause a split in the army.<ref>Holmes 2004, pp. 179\u2013180.</ref>\n\nRoberts had asked the [[Chief of the General Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS)]] [[John French, 1st Earl of Ypres|John French]] to come and see him at Ascot on 19 March; French had been too busy but invited Roberts to visit him when next in London. On the morning of 21 March Roberts and French had an acrimonious telephone conversation in which Roberts told French that he would share the blame if he collaborated with the Cabinet's \"dastardly\" attempt to coerce Ulster, and then, after French told him that he would \"do his duty as a soldier\" and obey lawful orders, put the phone down on him. Soon after, Roberts received a telegram from [[Hubert Gough]], purporting to ask for advice, although possibly designed to goad him into further action. Roberts requested an audience with [[George V|King George V]], who told him that [[J. E. B. Seely, 1st Baron Mottistone|Seely]] (Secretary of State for War), to whom the King had recently spoken, had complained that Roberts was \"at the bottom\" of the matter, had incited Gough, and had called the politicians \"swine and robbers\" in his phone conversation with French. Roberts indignantly denied this, claiming that he had not been in contact with Gough for \"years\" and that he had advised officers not to resign.<ref name=\"Holmes 2004, p181-3\">Holmes 2004, pp. 181\u2013183.</ref> Roberts's claim may not be the whole truth as Gough was on first name terms with Roberts's daughter and later gave her copies of key documents relating to the Incident.<ref>Holmes 2004, p. 172.</ref>\n[[File:Lord roberts of kandahar.jpg|thumb|upright|''Lord Roberts of Kabul and Kandahar on his Celebrated Charger''<ref>''[[Harper's Magazine]]'', European Edition, December 1897, p. 27.</ref>]]\nRoberts also had an interview with Seely (he was unable to locate French, who was in fact himself having an audience with the King at the time) but came away thinking him \"drunk with power\", although he learned that Paget had been acting without authority (in talking of \"commencing active operations\" against Ulster and in offering officers a chance to discuss hypothetical orders and to threaten to resign) and left a note for Hubert Gough to this effect. This note influenced the Gough brothers in being willing to remain in the Army, albeit with a written guarantee that the Army would not have to act against Ulster. After Roberts's lobbying, the King insisted that Asquith make no further troop movements in Ulster without consulting him.<ref name=\"Holmes 2004, p181-3\"/>\n\nRoberts wrote to French (22 March) denying the \"swine and robbers\" comment, although French's reply stressed his hurt that Roberts had thought so ill of him.<ref>Holmes 2004, p. 189.</ref>\n\n===Death===\nRoberts died of [[pneumonia]] at [[Saint-Omer|St Omer]], France, on 14 November 1914 while visiting Indian troops fighting in the [[World War I|First World War]].<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> His body was taken to Ascot by special train for a funeral service on 18 November before being taken to London.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Spark|first1=Stephen|title=Forum|journal=Backtrack|date=December 2016|volume=30|issue=12|page=765}}</ref> After [[lying in state]] in [[Westminster Hall]] (one of two individuals who were not members of the royal family to do so during the 20th century, the other being [[Winston Churchill|Sir Winston Churchill]]), he was given a [[state funeral]] and was then buried in St. Paul's Cathedral.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nRoberts had lived at [[Englemere House]] at [[Ascot, Berkshire|Ascot]] in [[Berkshire]].

Although the brothers were not considered suspects at first, suspicions about their involvement arose when they began to spend money lavishly after the murders. During the trial, the brothers alleged that they committed the murders because of years of [[sexual abuse|sexual]] and [[emotional abuse]] that they suffered at the hands of their parents, particularly their father. They were first tried separately, with one jury for each brother. Both juries deadlocked, which resulted in a mistrial. For the second trial, they were tried together by the same jury, which found them guilty, and as a result, they were sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.\n\n==Background==\nLyle and Erik's father, Jos\u00e9 Enrique Men\u00e9ndez, was born on May 6, 1944 in [[Havana]], [[Cuba]].

Although the brothers were not considered suspects at first, suspicions about their involvement arose when they began to spend money lavishly after the murders. During the trial, the brothers alleged that they committed the murders because of years of [[sexual abuse|sexual]] and [[emotional abuse]] that they suffered at the hands of their parents, particularly their father. They were first tried separately, with one jury for each brother. Both juries deadlocked, which resulted in a mistrial. For the second trial, they were tried together by the same jury, which found them guilty, and as a result, they were sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.\n\n==Background==\nLyle and Erik's father, Jos\u00e9 Enrique Men\u00e9ndez, was born on May 6, 1944 in [[Havana]], [[Cuba]]. At age 16, he moved to the [[United States]] after the [[Cuban Revolution]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0580036/bio|title=Jose Menendez|website=IMDb|access-date=2017-12-07}}</ref> Jos\u00e9 attended [[Southern Illinois University]], where he met Mary Louise \"Kitty\" Andersen (1941\u20131989).

The jury said that the abuse defense was not a factor in its deliberations, but chose not to impose the death penalty because both brothers had no criminal record or history of violence prior to the murders of their parents.
