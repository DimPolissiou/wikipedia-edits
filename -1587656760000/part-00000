Scientific systems of units are a refinement of the concept of weights and measures historically developed for commercial purposes.<ref>https://www.texasgateway.org/resource/13-language-physics-physical-quantities-and-units</ref>\n\n[[Science]], [[medicine]], and [[engineering]] often use larger and smaller units of measurement than those used in everyday life. The judicious selection of the units of measurement can aid researchers in [[problem solving]] (see, for example, [[dimensional analysis]]).\n\nIn the [[social sciences]], there are no standard units of measurement and the theory and practice of measurement is studied in [[psychometrics]] and the [[theory of conjoint measurement]].\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of measurement}}\n\nA unit of measurement is a standardised [[quantity]] of a physical property, used as a factor to express occurring quantities of that property. Units of measurement were among the earliest tools invented by humans. Primitive societies needed rudimentary measures for many tasks: constructing dwellings of an appropriate size and shape, fashioning clothing, or bartering food or raw materials.\n\nThe earliest known uniform systems of measurement seem to have all been created sometime in the [[4th millennium BC|4th]] and [[3rd millennium BC|3rd millennia BC]] among the ancient peoples of [[Mesopotamia]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] and the [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Indus Valley]], and perhaps also [[Elam]] in [[Iran|Persia]] as well.\n\nWeights and measures are mentioned in the [[Bible]] (Leviticus 19:35\u201336). It is a commandment to be honest and have fair measures.\n\nIn the ''[[Magna Carta]]'' of 1215 (The Great Charter) with the seal of [[John, King of England|King John]], put before him by the Barons of England, King John agreed in Clause 35 \"There shall be one measure of wine throughout our whole realm, and one measure of ale and one measure of corn\u2014namely, the London quart;\u2014and one width of dyed and russet and hauberk cloths\u2014namely, two ells below the selvage...\"\n\nAs of the 21st Century, multiple unit systems are used all over the world such as the United States Customary System, the British Customary System, and the International System. However, the United States is the only industrialized country that has not yet completely converted to the Metric System. The systematic effort to develop a universally acceptable system of units dates back to 1790 when the French National Assembly charged the French Academy of Sciences to come up such a unit system. This system was the precursor to the metric system which was quickly developed in France but did not take on universal acceptance until 1875 when The Metric Convention Treaty was signed by 17 nations. After this treaty was signed, a General Conference of Weights and Measures (CGPM) was established. The CGPM produced the current SI system which was adopted in 1954 at the 10th conference of weights and measures. Currently, the United States is a dual-system society which uses both the SI system and the US Customary system.<ref>{{cite book|authors=Yunus A. \u00c7engel & Michael A. Boles|title=Thermodynamics: An Engineering Approach|publisher=McGraw Hill|location=TN|isbn=9780073398174|pages=996|edition=Eighth|date=2002}}</ref>\n\n==Systems of units==\n{{main|System of measurement}}\nThe use of a single unit of measurement for some quantity has obvious drawbacks. For example, it is impractical to use the same unit for the distance between two cities and the length of a needle. Thus, historically they would develop independently. One way to make large numbers or small fractions easier to read, is to use [[unit prefixes]].\n\nAt some point in time though, the need to relate the two units might arise, and consequently the need to choose one unit as defining the other or vice versa. For example, an [[inch]] could be defined in terms of a [[Barleycorn (unit)|barleycorn]]. A system of measurement is a collection of units of measurement and rules relating them to each other.\n\nAs [[science]] progressed, a need arose to relate the measurement systems of different quantities, like length and weight and volume. The effort of attempting to relate different traditional systems between each other exposed many inconsistencies, and brought about the development of new units and systems.  \n\nThe system of units varies from country to country and some of the different system of units are [[Centimetre\u2013gram\u2013second system of units|CGS system of units]], [[Foot\u2013pound\u2013second system|FPS system of units]], [[MKS system of units]] and [[International System of Units|SI system of units]]. Among the different system of units using in the world, the most widely used and internationally accepted one is the [[International System of Units]], or SI system of units. In this SI units system, there are seven [[SI base unit]]s and three supplementary units. The base SI units are metre, kilogram, second, kelvin, ampere, candela and the mole and the three supplementary SI units are radian, steradian and becquerel. All [[SI derived unit|other SI units]] can be derived from these base units.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.helpyoubetter.com/measurement-in-physics-and-si-units-of-measurement/|title=Measurement in Physics & SI units of Measurement|date=15 November 2018|website=HelpYouBetter|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-15}}</ref> \n\nSystems of measurement in modern use include the [[metric system]], the [[imperial system]], and [[United States customary units]]. \n \n===Traditional systems===\nHistorically many of the systems of measurement which had been in use were to some extent based on the dimensions of the human body. As a result, units of measure could vary not only from location to location, but from person to person.\n\n===Metric systems===\n[[Metric system]]s of units have [[History of the metric system|evolved since the adoption of the original metric system]] in [[France]] in 1791. The current international standard metric system is the [[SI|International System of Units]] (abbreviated to SI). An important feature of modern systems is [[standardization]]. Each unit has a universally recognized size.\n[[File:Tabella conversione metrica 1860 MG 7771.jpg|thumb|An example of [[metrication]] in 1860 when Tuscany became part of modern Italy (ex. one \"libbra\" = 339.54 grams)]]\n\nBoth the [[imperial units]] and [[US customary units]] derive from earlier [[English unit]]s. Imperial units were mostly used in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] and the former [[British Empire]]. US customary units are still the main system of measurement used in the [[United States]] outside of science, medicine, many sectors of industry, and some of government and military, and despite Congress having legally authorised metric measure on 28 July 1866.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url         = http://lamar.colostate.edu/~hillger/laws/metric-act.html\n |title       = US Metric Act of 1866\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20141010211054/http://lamar.colostate.edu/~hillger/laws/metric-act.html\n |archivedate = 10 October 2014\n |df          = dmy-all\n}} as amended by Public Law 110\u201369 dated 9 August 2007</ref> Some steps towards US [[metrication]] have been made, particularly the redefinition of basic US and imperial units to derive exactly from SI units.

Systems of units based on these are called [[natural units]]. Similar to natural units, [[atomic units]] (au) are a convenient [[system of units]] of measurement used in [[atomic physics]].\n\nAlso a great number of [[List of unusual units of measurement|unusual and non-standard units]] may be encountered. These may include the [[solar mass]] ({{val|2|e=30|u=kg}}), the [[TNT equivalent|megaton]] (the energy released by detonating one million tons of [[trinitrotoluene]], TNT), the [[electronvolt]], or the [[Barn (unit)|barn]] (the likelihood of interaction between subatomic particles).\n\n===Legal control of weights and measures===\nTo reduce the incidence of retail fraud, many national [[statutes]] have standard definitions of weights and measures that may be used (hence \"[[statute measure]]\"), and these are verified by legal officers.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\n===Informal comparison to familiar concepts===\n{{mainarticle|List of unusual units of measurement}}\nIn informal settings, a quantity may be described as multiples of that of a familiar entity, which can be easier to contextualize than a value in a formal unit system. For instance, a publication may describe an area in a foreign country as a number of multiples of the area of a region local to the readership. The propensity for certain concepts to be used frequently can give rise to loosely defined \"systems\" of units.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Marsh |first1=David |title=Mind your language: Wales, Belgium and other units of measurement |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/mind-your-language/2010/may/17/mind-your-language-david-marsh |accessdate=30 August 2018 |work=the Guardian |date=17 May 2010 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Size of Wales |url=https://www.economist.com/johnson/2010/06/11/size-of-wales |accessdate=30 August 2018 |work=The Economist |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Base and derived units==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Measurement]] -->\nFor most quantities a unit is necessary to communicate values of that physical quantity. For example, conveying to someone a particular length without using some sort of unit is impossible, because a length cannot be described without a reference used to make sense of the value given.\n\nBut not all quantities require a unit of their own. Using physical laws, units of quantities can be expressed as combinations of units of other quantities. Thus only a small set of units is required. These units are taken as the ''base units and the o''ther units are ''derived units''. Thus base units are the units of the quantities which are independent of other quantities and they are the units of length, mass, time, electric current, temperature, luminous intensity and the amount of substance. Derived units are the units of the quantities which are derived from the base quantities and some of the derived units are the units of speed, work, acceleration, energy, pressure etc.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDifferent systems of units are based on different choices of a set of related units including fundamental and derived units. \n\n==Calculations with units of measurement==\n\n===Units as dimensions===\nAny value of a [[physical quantity]] is expressed as a comparison to a unit of that quantity. For example, the value of a physical quantity ''Z'' is expressed as the product of a unit [Z] and a numerical factor:\n\n:<math>Z = n \\times [Z] = n [Z].</math> For example, let <math>Z</math> be \"2 candlesticks\", then <math>Z = 2 [Z] = 2 </math> candlestick.\n\nThe multiplication sign is usually left out, just as it is left out between variables in scientific notation of formulas. The conventions used to express quantities is referred to as [[quantity calculus]]. In formulas the unit [Z] can be treated as if it were a specific magnitude of a kind of physical [[dimension]]: see [[dimensional analysis]] for more on this treatment.\n\nUnits can only be added or subtracted if they are the same type; however units can always be multiplied or divided, as [[George Gamow]] used to explain. Let <math>Z_1</math> be \"2 candlesticks\" and <math>Z_2</math> \"3 cabdrivers\", then\n\n:\"2 candlesticks\" times \"3 cabdrivers\" <math>= [Z_1][Z_2] = 6 </math> candlestick <math> \\times </math> cabdriver.\n\nA distinction should be made between units and standards. A unit is fixed by its definition, and is independent of physical conditions such as temperature. By contrast, a standard is a physical realization of a unit, and realizes that unit only under certain physical conditions. For example, the metre is a unit, while a metal bar is a standard. One metre is the same length regardless of temperature, but a metal bar will be exactly one metre long only at a certain temperature.\n\nThere are certain rules that have to be used when dealing with units:\n\n* Treat units algebraically. Only add like terms. When a unit is divided by itself, the division yields a unitless one. When two different units are multiplied or divided, the result is a new unit, referred to by the combination of the units. For instance, in SI, the unit of speed is metres per second (m/s). See [[dimensional analysis]]. A unit can be multiplied by itself, creating a unit with an exponent (e.g. m<sup>2</sup>/s<sup>2</sup>). Put simply, units obey the laws of indices. (See [[Exponentiation]].)\n* Some units have special names, however these should be treated like their equivalents. For example, one newton (N) is equivalent to 1&nbsp;kg\u22c5m/s<sup>2</sup>. Thus a quantity may have several unit designations, for example: the unit for [[surface tension]] can be referred to as either N/m (newton per metre) or kg/s<sup>2</sup> (kilogram per second squared). Whether these designations are equivalent is disputed amongst metrologists.<ref name=\"Emerson\">{{Cite journal | title = On quantity calculus and units of measurement | first = W.H. | last = Emerson | year = 2008 |journal = [[Metrologia]] | volume = 45 | pages = 134\u2013138 |bibcode = 2008Metro..45..134E |doi = 10.1088/0026-1394/45/2/002 | issue = 2}}</ref>\n\n===Expressing a physical value in terms of another unit===<!-- This section is linked from [[Watt-hour]] -->\n[[Conversion of units]] involves comparison of different standard physical values, either of a single physical quantity or of a physical quantity and a combination of other physical quantities.\n\nStarting with:\n\n:<math>Z = n_i \\times [Z]_i</math>\n\nreplace the original unit <math>[Z]_i</math> with its meaning in terms of the desired unit <math>[Z]_j</math>, e.g. if <math>[Z]_i = c_{ij} \\times [Z]_j</math>, then:\n\n:<math>Z = n_i \\times (c_{ij} \\times [Z]_j) = (n_i \\times c_{ij}) \\times [Z]_j</math>\n\nNow <math>n_i</math> and <math>c_{ij}</math> are both numerical values, so just calculate their product.\n\nOr, which is just mathematically the same thing, multiply ''Z'' by unity, the product is still ''Z'':\n\n:<math>Z = n_i \\times [Z]_i \\times ( c_{ij} \\times [Z]_j/[Z]_i )</math>\n\nFor example, you have an expression for a physical value ''Z'' involving the unit ''feet per second'' (<math>[Z]_i</math>) and you want it in terms of the unit ''miles per hour'' (<math>[Z]_j</math>):\n\n{{ordered list\n|1= Find facts relating the original unit to the desired unit:\n\n:1 mile = 5280 feet and 1 hour = 3600 seconds\n\n|2= Next use the above equations to construct a fraction that has a value of unity and that contains units such that, when it is multiplied with the original physical value, will cancel the original units:\n\n:<math>1 = \\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{mi}}{5280\\,\\mathrm{ft}}\\quad \\mathrm{and}\\quad 1 = \\frac{3600\\,\\mathrm{s}}{1\\,\\mathrm{h}}</math>\n\n|3= Last, multiply the original expression of the physical value by the fraction, called a ''[[conversion factor]]'', to obtain the same physical value expressed in terms of a different unit. Note: since valid conversion factors are [[dimensionless]] and have a numerical value of [[one]], multiplying any physical quantity by such a conversion factor (which is 1) does not change that physical quantity.\n\n:<math> 52.8\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{ft}}{\\mathrm{s}} =\n 52.8\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{ft}}{\\mathrm{s}}\n \\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{mi}}{5280\\,\\mathrm{ft}}\n \\frac{3600\\,\\mathrm{s}}{1\\,\\mathrm{h}} =\n \\frac {52.8 \\times 3600}{5280}\\,\\mathrm{mi/h}\n = 36\\,\\mathrm{mi/h}</math>\n}}\n\nOr as an example using the metric system, you have a value of fuel economy in the unit ''litres per 100 kilometres'' and you want it in terms of the unit ''microlitres per metre'':\n\n:<math> \\mathrm{\\frac{9\\,\\rm{L}}{100\\,\\rm{km}}} =\n \\mathrm{\\frac{9\\,\\rm{L}}{100\\,\\rm{km}}}\n\n \\mathrm{\\frac{1000000\\,\\rm{\\mu L}}{1\\,\\rm{L}}}\n \\mathrm{\\frac{1\\,\\rm{km}}{1000\\,\\rm{m}}} =\n \\frac {9 \\times 1000000}{100 \\times 1000}\\,\\mathrm{\\mu L/m} =\n 90\\,\\mathrm{\\mu L/m}</math>\n\n==Real-world implications==\nOne example of the importance of agreed units is the failure of the [[NASA]] [[Mars Climate Orbiter]], which was accidentally destroyed on a mission to Mars in September 1999 instead of entering orbit due to miscommunications about the value of forces: different computer programs used different units of measurement ([[Newton (unit)|newton]] versus [[pound force]]).

Scientific systems of units are a refinement of the concept of weights and measures historically developed for commercial purposes.<ref>https://www.texasgateway.org/resource/13-language-physics-physical-quantities-and-units</ref>\n\n[[Science]], [[medicine]], and [[engineering]] often use larger and smaller units of measurement than those used in everyday life. The judicious selection of the units of measurement can aid researchers in [[problem solving]] (see, for example, [[dimensional analysis]]).\n\nIn the [[social sciences]], there are no standard units of measurement and the theory and practice of measurement is studied in [[psychometrics]] and the [[theory of conjoint measurement]].\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of measurement}}\n\nA unit of measurement is a standardised [[quantity]] of a physical property, used as a factor to express occurring quantities of that property. Units of measurement were among the earliest tools invented by humans. Primitive societies needed rudimentary measures for many tasks: constructing dwellings of an appropriate size and shape, fashioning clothing, or bartering food or raw materials.\n\nThe earliest known uniform systems of measurement seem to have all been created sometime in the [[4th millennium BC|4th]] and [[3rd millennium BC|3rd millennia BC]] among the ancient peoples of [[Mesopotamia]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] and the [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Indus Valley]], and perhaps also [[Elam]] in [[Iran|Persia]] as well.\n\nWeights and measures are mentioned in the [[Bible]] (Leviticus 19:35\u201336). It is a commandment to be honest and have fair measures.\n\nIn the ''[[Magna Carta]]'' of 1215 (The Great Charter) with the seal of [[John, King of England|King John]], put before him by the Barons of England, King John agreed in Clause 35 \"There shall be one measure of wine throughout our whole realm, and one measure of ale and one measure of corn\u2014namely, the London quart;\u2014and one width of dyed and russet and hauberk cloths\u2014namely, two ells below the selvage...\"\n\nAs of the 21st Century, multiple unit systems are used all over the world such as the United States Customary System, the British Customary System, and the International System. However, the United States is the only industrialized country that has not yet completely converted to the Metric System. The systematic effort to develop a universally acceptable system of units dates back to 1790 when the French National Assembly charged the French Academy of Sciences to come up such a unit system. This system was the precursor to the metric system which was quickly developed in France but did not take on universal acceptance until 1875 when The Metric Convention Treaty was signed by 17 nations. After this treaty was signed, a General Conference of Weights and Measures (CGPM) was established. The CGPM produced the current SI system which was adopted in 1954 at the 10th conference of weights and measures. Currently, the United States is a dual-system society which uses both the SI system and the US Customary system.<ref>{{cite book|authors=Yunus A. \u00c7engel & Michael A. Boles|title=Thermodynamics: An Engineering Approach|publisher=McGraw Hill|location=TN|isbn=9780073398174|pages=996|edition=Eighth|date=2002}}</ref>\n\n==Systems of units==\n{{main|System of measurement}}\nThe use of a single unit of measurement for some quantity has obvious drawbacks. For example, it is impractical to use the same unit for the distance between two cities and the length of a needle. Thus, historically they would develop independently. One way to make large numbers or small fractions easier to read, is to use [[unit prefixes]].\n\nAt some point in time though, the need to relate the two units might arise, and consequently the need to choose one unit as defining the other or vice versa. For example, an [[inch]] could be defined in terms of a [[Barleycorn (unit)|barleycorn]]. A system of measurement is a collection of units of measurement and rules relating them to each other.\n\nAs [[science]] progressed, a need arose to relate the measurement systems of different quantities, like length and weight and volume. The effort of attempting to relate different traditional systems between each other exposed many inconsistencies, and brought about the development of new units and systems.  \n\nThe system of units varies from country to country and some of the different system of units are [[Centimetre\u2013gram\u2013second system of units|CGS system of units]], [[Foot\u2013pound\u2013second system|FPS system of units]], [[MKS system of units]] and [[International System of Units|SI system of units]]. Among the different system of units using in the world, the most widely used and internationally accepted one is the [[International System of Units]], or SI system of units. In this SI units system, there are seven [[SI base unit]]s and three supplementary units. The base SI units are metre, kilogram, second, kelvin, ampere, candela and the mole and the three supplementary SI units are radian, steradian and becquerel. All [[SI derived unit|other SI units]] can be derived from these base units.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.helpyoubetter.com/measurement-in-physics-and-si-units-of-measurement/|title=Measurement in Physics & SI units of Measurement|date=15 November 2018|website=HelpYouBetter|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-15}}</ref> \n\nSystems of measurement in modern use include the [[metric system]], the [[imperial system]], and [[United States customary units]]. \n \n===Traditional systems===\nHistorically many of the systems of measurement which had been in use were to some extent based on the dimensions of the human body. As a result, units of measure could vary not only from location to location, but from person to person.\n\n===Metric systems===\n[[Metric system]]s of units have [[History of the metric system|evolved since the adoption of the original metric system]] in [[France]] in 1791. The current international standard metric system is the [[SI|International System of Units]] (abbreviated to SI). An important feature of modern systems is [[standardization]]. Each unit has a universally recognized size.\n[[File:Tabella conversione metrica 1860 MG 7771.jpg|thumb|An example of [[metrication]] in 1860 when Tuscany became part of modern Italy (ex. one \"libbra\" = 339.54 grams)]]\n\nBoth the [[imperial units]] and [[US customary units]] derive from earlier [[English unit]]s. Imperial units were mostly used in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] and the former [[British Empire]]. US customary units are still the main system of measurement used in the [[United States]] outside of science, medicine, many sectors of industry, and some of government and military, and despite Congress having legally authorised metric measure on 28 July 1866.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url         = http://lamar.colostate.edu/~hillger/laws/metric-act.html\n |title       = US Metric Act of 1866\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20141010211054/http://lamar.colostate.edu/~hillger/laws/metric-act.html\n |archivedate = 10 October 2014\n |df          = dmy-all\n}} as amended by Public Law 110\u201369 dated 9 August 2007</ref> Some steps towards US [[metrication]] have been made, particularly the redefinition of basic US and imperial units to derive exactly from SI units.

Systems of units based on these are called [[natural units]]. Similar to natural units, [[atomic units]] (au) are a convenient [[system of units]] of measurement used in [[atomic physics]].\n\nAlso a great number of [[List of unusual units of measurement|unusual and non-standard units]] may be encountered. These may include the [[solar mass]] ({{val|2|e=30|u=kg}}), the [[TNT equivalent|megaton]] (the energy released by detonating one million tons of [[trinitrotoluene]], TNT) and the [[electronvolt]].\n\n===Legal control of weights and measures===\nTo reduce the incidence of retail fraud, many national [[statutes]] have standard definitions of weights and measures that may be used (hence \"[[statute measure]]\"), and these are verified by legal officers.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\n===Informal comparison to familiar concepts===\n{{mainarticle|List of unusual units of measurement}}\nIn informal settings, a quantity may be described as multiples of that of a familiar entity, which can be easier to contextualize than a value in a formal unit system. For instance, a publication may describe an area in a foreign country as a number of multiples of the area of a region local to the readership. The propensity for certain concepts to be used frequently can give rise to loosely defined \"systems\" of units.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Marsh |first1=David |title=Mind your language: Wales, Belgium and other units of measurement |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/mind-your-language/2010/may/17/mind-your-language-david-marsh |accessdate=30 August 2018 |work=the Guardian |date=17 May 2010 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Size of Wales |url=https://www.economist.com/johnson/2010/06/11/size-of-wales |accessdate=30 August 2018 |work=The Economist |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Base and derived units==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Measurement]] -->\nFor most quantities a unit is necessary to communicate values of that physical quantity. For example, conveying to someone a particular length without using some sort of unit is impossible, because a length cannot be described without a reference used to make sense of the value given.\n\nBut not all quantities require a unit of their own. Using physical laws, units of quantities can be expressed as combinations of units of other quantities. Thus only a small set of units is required. These units are taken as the ''base units and the o''ther units are ''derived units''. Thus base units are the units of the quantities which are independent of other quantities and they are the units of length, mass, time, electric current, temperature, luminous intensity and the amount of substance. Derived units are the units of the quantities which are derived from the base quantities and some of the derived units are the units of speed, work, acceleration, energy, pressure etc.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDifferent systems of units are based on different choices of a set of related units including fundamental and derived units. \n\n==Calculations with units of measurement==\n\n===Units as dimensions===\nAny value of a [[physical quantity]] is expressed as a comparison to a unit of that quantity. For example, the value of a physical quantity ''Z'' is expressed as the product of a unit [Z] and a numerical factor:\n\n:<math>Z = n \\times [Z] = n [Z].</math> For example, let <math>Z</math> be \"2 candlesticks\", then <math>Z = 2 [Z] = 2 </math> candlestick.\n\nThe multiplication sign is usually left out, just as it is left out between variables in scientific notation of formulas. The conventions used to express quantities is referred to as [[quantity calculus]]. In formulas the unit [Z] can be treated as if it were a specific magnitude of a kind of physical [[dimension]]: see [[dimensional analysis]] for more on this treatment.\n\nUnits can only be added or subtracted if they are the same type; however units can always be multiplied or divided, as [[George Gamow]] used to explain. Let <math>Z_1</math> be \"2 candlesticks\" and <math>Z_2</math> \"3 cabdrivers\", then\n\n:\"2 candlesticks\" times \"3 cabdrivers\" <math>= [Z_1][Z_2] = 6 </math> candlestick <math> \\times </math> cabdriver.\n\nA distinction should be made between units and standards. A unit is fixed by its definition, and is independent of physical conditions such as temperature. By contrast, a standard is a physical realization of a unit, and realizes that unit only under certain physical conditions. For example, the metre is a unit, while a metal bar is a standard. One metre is the same length regardless of temperature, but a metal bar will be exactly one metre long only at a certain temperature.\n\nThere are certain rules that have to be used when dealing with units:\n\n* Treat units algebraically. Only add like terms. When a unit is divided by itself, the division yields a unitless one. When two different units are multiplied or divided, the result is a new unit, referred to by the combination of the units. For instance, in SI, the unit of speed is metres per second (m/s). See [[dimensional analysis]]. A unit can be multiplied by itself, creating a unit with an exponent (e.g. m<sup>2</sup>/s<sup>2</sup>). Put simply, units obey the laws of indices. (See [[Exponentiation]].)\n* Some units have special names, however these should be treated like their equivalents. For example, one newton (N) is equivalent to 1&nbsp;kg\u22c5m/s<sup>2</sup>. Thus a quantity may have several unit designations, for example: the unit for [[surface tension]] can be referred to as either N/m (newton per metre) or kg/s<sup>2</sup> (kilogram per second squared). Whether these designations are equivalent is disputed amongst metrologists.<ref name=\"Emerson\">{{Cite journal | title = On quantity calculus and units of measurement | first = W.H. | last = Emerson | year = 2008 |journal = [[Metrologia]] | volume = 45 | pages = 134\u2013138 |bibcode = 2008Metro..45..134E |doi = 10.1088/0026-1394/45/2/002 | issue = 2}}</ref>\n\n===Expressing a physical value in terms of another unit===<!-- This section is linked from [[Watt-hour]] -->\n[[Conversion of units]] involves comparison of different standard physical values, either of a single physical quantity or of a physical quantity and a combination of other physical quantities.\n\nStarting with:\n\n:<math>Z = n_i \\times [Z]_i</math>\n\nreplace the original unit <math>[Z]_i</math> with its meaning in terms of the desired unit <math>[Z]_j</math>, e.g. if <math>[Z]_i = c_{ij} \\times [Z]_j</math>, then:\n\n:<math>Z = n_i \\times (c_{ij} \\times [Z]_j) = (n_i \\times c_{ij}) \\times [Z]_j</math>\n\nNow <math>n_i</math> and <math>c_{ij}</math> are both numerical values, so just calculate their product.\n\nOr, which is just mathematically the same thing, multiply ''Z'' by unity, the product is still ''Z'':\n\n:<math>Z = n_i \\times [Z]_i \\times ( c_{ij} \\times [Z]_j/[Z]_i )</math>\n\nFor example, you have an expression for a physical value ''Z'' involving the unit ''feet per second'' (<math>[Z]_i</math>) and you want it in terms of the unit ''miles per hour'' (<math>[Z]_j</math>):\n\n{{ordered list\n|1= Find facts relating the original unit to the desired unit:\n\n:1 mile = 5280 feet and 1 hour = 3600 seconds\n\n|2= Next use the above equations to construct a fraction that has a value of unity and that contains units such that, when it is multiplied with the original physical value, will cancel the original units:\n\n:<math>1 = \\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{mi}}{5280\\,\\mathrm{ft}}\\quad \\mathrm{and}\\quad 1 = \\frac{3600\\,\\mathrm{s}}{1\\,\\mathrm{h}}</math>\n\n|3= Last, multiply the original expression of the physical value by the fraction, called a ''[[conversion factor]]'', to obtain the same physical value expressed in terms of a different unit.

Thus, the tracks partially overlap similar to [[roof shingle]]s.  This approach was selected because physical limitations prevent recording magnetic heads from having the same width as reading heads, leaving recording heads wider.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ewh.ieee.org/r6/scv/mag/MtgSum/Meeting2010_10_Presentation.pdf |title=Shingled Magnetic Recording and Two-Dimensional Magnetic Recording |author=Roger Wood |website=ewh.ieee.org |date=October 19, 2010 |accessdate=December 14, 2014 |format=PDF}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.storagereview.com/what_is_shingled_magnetic_recording_smr/ |title=What is Shingled Magnetic Recording (SMR)? |website=storagereview.com |date=January 30, 2015 |accessdate=February 9, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"snia-smr\">{{cite web\n | url = http://www.snia.org/sites/default/files/Dunn-Feldman_SNIA_Tutorial_Shingled_Magnetic_Recording-r7_Final.pdf\n | title = Shingled Magnetic Recording: Models, Standardization, and Applications\n | date = September 22, 2014 | accessdate = February 9, 2015\n | author1 = Mary Dunn | author2 = Timothy Feldman\n | publisher = [[Storage Networking Industry Association]]\n | format = PDF\n}}</ref>{{rp|7&ndash;9}}\n\nThe overlapping-tracks architecture complicates the writing process since writing to one track also overwrites an adjacent track. If adjacent tracks contain valid data, they must be rewritten as well. As a result, SMR drives are divided into many [[append-only]] (sequential) zones that need to be rewritten entirely when full, resembling flash blocks in [[solid state drive]]s. ''Device-managed'' SMR devices hide this complexity by managing it in the firmware, presenting an interface like any other hard disk. Other SMR devices are ''host-managed'' and depend on the operating system to know how to handle the drive, and only write sequentially to certain regions of the drive. <ref name=\"snia-smr\" />{{rp|11 ff.}}<ref>{{cite web |url=https://lwn.net/Articles/591782/ |title=Support for shingled magnetic recording devices |author=Jake Edge |publisher=[[LWN.net]] |date=March 26, 2014 |accessdate=December 14, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[Seagate Technology|Seagate]] has been shipping device-managed SMR hard drives since September 2013, while referring to an increase in overall hard disk drive capacity of about 25%, compared to non-shingled storage.<ref name=\"anandtech-7290\" /> In September 2014, [[HGST]] announced a 10&nbsp;TB drive filled with [[helium]] that uses host-managed shingled magnetic recording,<ref>{{Cite news |title= Shingled platters breathe helium inside HGST's 10TB hard drive |author= Geoff Gasior |date= September 9, 2014|work= The Tech Report |url= http://techreport.com/news/27031/shingled-platters-breathe-helium-inside-hgst-10tb-hard-drive |accessdate=February 9, 2015}}</ref> although in December 2015 it followed this with a 10&nbsp;TB helium-filled drive that uses conventional non-shingled perpendicular recording.<ref>{{cite news |title=HGST releases helium-filled 10TB hard drive; Seagate twiddles shingled fingers |author=Sebastian Anthony |date=3 December 2015 |work=Ars Technica |url=http://arstechnica.co.uk/information-technology/2015/12/hgst-releases-helium-filled-10tb-hard-drive-seagate-twiddles-shingled-fingers/ |accessdate=3 December 2015}}</ref> In November 2018, HGST introduced 14- and 15-TB drives.<ref>{{cite web |title=15TB and 14TB SMR Hard Drives Ultrastar DC HC620 |url=https://www.hgst.com/products/hard-drives/ultrastar-dc-hc620 |website=www.hgst.com |accessdate=30 October 2018 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n[[Western Digital]], Seagate and [[Toshiba]] have begun selling SMR drives without labeling them as such, thus revealing a large controversy, as SMR drives are much slower in some circumstances than [[Perpendicular recording|PMR]] drives.<ref name=Alcorn>{{cite news |last=Alcorn |first=Paul |date= |title=Sneaky Marketing Redux: Toshiba, Seagate Shipping Slower SMR Drives Without Disclosure, Too |url=https://www.tomshardware.com/news/sneaky-marketing-toshiba-seagate-wd-smr-drives-without-disclosure |work=Tom\u2019s Hardware  |access-date=17 April 2020}}</ref> These practices were used to be in both data storage-dedicated (for servers, NASes and cold storage) and consumer-centric HDDs.\n\n==Data management==\nThere are three different ways that data can be managed on an SMR drive:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.t10.org/cgi-bin/ac.pl?t=f&f=zbc-r05.pdf |title=Zoned Block Commands (ZBC) |website=t10.org |publisher=ANSI T10 Committee |access-date=22 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.snia.org/sites/default/files/SDC15_presentations/smr/JorgeCampello_SMR_Next_Generation_Storage_Technology.pdf |title=SMR: The Next Generation of Storage Technology |first=Jorge |last=Campello |date=24 September 2015 |access-date=22 January 2018}}</ref>\n* Device Managed\n* Host Managed\n* Host Aware\n\n===Device managed===\nA Device Managed drive appears to the host identically to a non-shingled drive.  It is not necessary for the host to follow any special protocols. All handling of data, as it relates to the shingled nature of the storage, is managed by the device.  In addition, the host is unaware that the storage is shingled.<ref name=\"snia-smr\" />\n\nThis type of SMR drives are often not labelled by the manufacturer.  Its firmware-controlled operation can be compared to [[solid state drive]]s, as LBA addresses do not correlate much to on-disk structure.  The append-only zones are very slow for random writing, so writes are first sent to a PMR (CMR) cache, and the disk moves these data to SMR parts when idle.  RAID [[resilvering]] tends to overload the cache, sending SMR drives into minutes-long pauses.

Thus, the tracks partially overlap similar to [[roof shingle]]s.  This approach was selected because physical limitations prevent recording magnetic heads from having the same width as reading heads, leaving recording heads wider.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ewh.ieee.org/r6/scv/mag/MtgSum/Meeting2010_10_Presentation.pdf |title=Shingled Magnetic Recording and Two-Dimensional Magnetic Recording |author=Roger Wood |website=ewh.ieee.org |date=October 19, 2010 |accessdate=December 14, 2014 |format=PDF}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.storagereview.com/what_is_shingled_magnetic_recording_smr/ |title=What is Shingled Magnetic Recording (SMR)? |website=storagereview.com |date=January 30, 2015 |accessdate=February 9, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"snia-smr\">{{cite web\n | url = http://www.snia.org/sites/default/files/Dunn-Feldman_SNIA_Tutorial_Shingled_Magnetic_Recording-r7_Final.pdf\n | title = Shingled Magnetic Recording: Models, Standardization, and Applications\n | date = September 22, 2014 | accessdate = February 9, 2015\n | author1 = Mary Dunn | author2 = Timothy Feldman\n | publisher = [[Storage Networking Industry Association]]\n | format = PDF\n}}</ref>{{rp|7&ndash;9}}\n\nThe overlapping-tracks architecture complicates the writing process since writing to one track also overwrites an adjacent track. If adjacent tracks contain valid data, they must be rewritten as well. As a result, SMR drives are divided into many [[append-only]] (sequential) zones that need to be rewritten entirely when full, resembling flash blocks in [[solid state drive]]s. ''Device-managed'' SMR devices hide this complexity by managing it in the firmware, presenting an interface like any other hard disk. Other SMR devices are ''host-managed'' and depend on the operating system to know how to handle the drive, and only write sequentially to certain regions of the drive. <ref name=\"snia-smr\" />{{rp|11 ff.}}<ref>{{cite web |url=https://lwn.net/Articles/591782/ |title=Support for shingled magnetic recording devices |author=Jake Edge |publisher=[[LWN.net]] |date=March 26, 2014 |accessdate=December 14, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[Seagate Technology|Seagate]] has been shipping device-managed SMR hard drives since September 2013, while referring to an increase in overall hard disk drive capacity of about 25%, compared to non-shingled storage.<ref name=\"anandtech-7290\" /> In September 2014, [[HGST]] announced a 10&nbsp;TB drive filled with [[helium]] that uses host-managed shingled magnetic recording,<ref>{{Cite news |title= Shingled platters breathe helium inside HGST's 10TB hard drive |author= Geoff Gasior |date= September 9, 2014|work= The Tech Report |url= http://techreport.com/news/27031/shingled-platters-breathe-helium-inside-hgst-10tb-hard-drive |accessdate=February 9, 2015}}</ref> although in December 2015 it followed this with a 10&nbsp;TB helium-filled drive that uses conventional non-shingled perpendicular recording.<ref>{{cite news |title=HGST releases helium-filled 10TB hard drive; Seagate twiddles shingled fingers |author=Sebastian Anthony |date=3 December 2015 |work=Ars Technica |url=http://arstechnica.co.uk/information-technology/2015/12/hgst-releases-helium-filled-10tb-hard-drive-seagate-twiddles-shingled-fingers/ |accessdate=3 December 2015}}</ref> In November 2018, HGST introduced 14- and 15-TB drives.<ref>{{cite web |title=15TB and 14TB SMR Hard Drives Ultrastar DC HC620 |url=https://www.hgst.com/products/hard-drives/ultrastar-dc-hc620 |website=www.hgst.com |accessdate=30 October 2018 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n[[Western Digital]], Seagate and [[Toshiba]] have begun selling SMR drives without labeling them as such, thus revealing a large controversy, as SMR drives are much slower in some circumstances than [[Perpendicular recording|PMR]] drives.<ref name=Alcorn>{{cite news |last=Alcorn |first=Paul |date= |title=Sneaky Marketing Redux: Toshiba, Seagate Shipping Slower SMR Drives Without Disclosure, Too |url=https://www.tomshardware.com/news/sneaky-marketing-toshiba-seagate-wd-smr-drives-without-disclosure |work=Tom\u2019s Hardware  |access-date=17 April 2020}}</ref> These practices were used to be in both data storage-dedicated (for servers, NASes and cold storage) and consumer-centric HDDs.\n\n==Data management==\nThere are three different ways that data can be managed on an SMR drive:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.t10.org/cgi-bin/ac.pl?t=f&f=zbc-r05.pdf |title=Zoned Block Commands (ZBC) |website=t10.org |publisher=ANSI T10 Committee |access-date=22 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.snia.org/sites/default/files/SDC15_presentations/smr/JorgeCampello_SMR_Next_Generation_Storage_Technology.pdf |title=SMR: The Next Generation of Storage Technology |first=Jorge |last=Campello |date=24 September 2015 |access-date=22 January 2018}}</ref>\n* Device Managed\n* Host Managed\n* Host Aware\n\n===Device managed===\nA Device Managed drive appears to the host identically to a non-shingled drive.

Its firmware-controlled operation can be compared to [[solid state drive]]s, as LBA addresses do not correlate much to on-disk structure.  The append-only zones are very slow for random writing, so writes are first sent to a PMR (CMR) cache, and the disk moves these data to SMR parts when idle.  RAID [[resilvering]] tends to overload the cache, sending SMR drives into minutes-long pauses. Faulty firmware (such as WD40EFAX) may also throw an error when asked to read an address never written to. Both behaviors tend to be interpreted as drive failure by the RAID controller.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Mellor |first1=Chris |title=Shingled hard drives have non-shingled zones for caching writes |url=https://blocksandfiles.com/2020/04/15/shingled-drives-have-non-shingled-zones-for-caching-writes/ |website=Blocks and Files |date=15 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe zoned nature of SMR also means that the disk suffers from [[write amplification]], although for hard drives the main problem with writes is speed instead of longevity.

In 1741, at the age of 19 due to his uncle Ignatiy Poltavtsev he was taken from Kiev to sing in the imperial choir in [[Moscow]] and [[St. Petersburg]] returning to Kiev in 1744. He spent the period from 1745 to 1750 [[Kingdom of Hungary (1526\u20131867)|in the kingdom of Hungary]] and is thought to have traveled elsewhere in Europe during this period as well. In 1750 he returned to Kiev. From 1750\u20131751 he taught poetics in [[Pereiaslav]]. For most of the period from 1753 to 1759 Skovoroda was a tutor in the family of a landowner in Kovrai. From 1759 to 1769, with interruptions, he taught such subjects as poetry, [[syntax]], [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], and [[ethics]] at the Khark\u043ev Collegium (also called Kharkiv Collegium). After an attack on his course on ethics in 1769 he decided to abandon teaching.\n\nSkovoroda is known as a composer of [[liturgical music]], as well as a number of songs to his own texts. Of the latter, several have passed into the realm of [[Ukrainian folk music]]. Many of his philosophical songs known as \"Skovorodskie psalmy\" were often encountered in the repertoire of blind traveling folk musicians known as [[kobzar]]s. He was described as a proficient player on the [[flute]], [[torban]] and [[kobza]].\n\nIn the final quarter of his life he traveled by foot through Sloboda Ukraine staying with various friends, both rich and poor, preferring not to remain in one place for too long. During this time he dedicated himself to individual hermit-like monastic life and study.\n\nThis last period was the time of his great philosophic works. In this period as well, but particularly earlier, he wrote poetry and letters in [[Church Slavonic language]], Greek and [[Latin]] and did a number of translations from Latin into Russian.\n\n== Language ==\n{{One source|section|date=July 2014}}\n[[File:Skovoroda's fountain.jpg|thumb|Picture of the Skovorada's concept \"Unequal to all equality\"]]\nThere is much debate regarding the language Skovoroda used in his writings. Skovoroda used a form of written Ukrainian which differed somewhat from the [[vernacular]] Ukrainian. As a scholar studying in a religious institution that relied heavily on various forms of the [[Church Slavonic language|Church-Slavonic]] language although the foundation of his written language was Ukrainian.<ref name=\"George Y.

His poetry has been analysed for foreign non-Ukrainian elements. After an in depth study of Skovoroda's written works the Slavic linguist [[George Shevelov]] was able to deduce that apart from Ukrainian it contained 7.8% Russian, 7.7% non-Slavic, and 27.6% Church Slavonic vocabulary, and that the variant of Church Slavonic he used was the variety used in the Synodinal Bible of 1751.<ref name=\"George Y. Shevelov\" /> Skovoroda's prose however had a higher content of non-Ukrainian vocabulary: 36.7% Church Slavonic, 4.7% other non-Slavonic European languages, and 9.7% Russian.<ref name=\"George Y. Shevelov\" />\n\nAfter an [[Linguistic analysis|in depth analysis]] of Skovoroda's language, [[George Shevelov|G. Shevelov]] came to the conclusion that the high incidence of Church-Slavonic and the occurrence of Russian words reflect the circle of people with which Skovoroda primarily associated himself with, and on who he was materially dependent \u2013 and not the villagers and the village language that he knew and spoke.<ref name=\"George Y. Shevelov\" />\n\n[[George Shevelov]] concludes: \u2033In Summary, the language of Skovoroda, minus its many biblical and ecclesiastical, political and personal features is, in its foundation, the Slobozhanshchina variety of standard Russian as used by the educated\u2033.<ref name=\"George Y. Shevelov\" />\n\nSimilarly, Dan Chopyk describes the written language characteristics of Skovoroda's fables as mixed:\n\"His fables, written in a mixed Russian-Ukrainian-Church Slavonic language were, according to Gorkij and Tolstoy, very effective and, judging by the number of extant copies, were equally liked by gentry and commoners.\" <ref>Skovoroda, Gregory S. Fables and Aphorisms. Translation, biography, and analysis by Dan B. Chopyk (New York: Peter Lang, 1990) pg. 36</ref>\n\n== Death ==\n\nThree days before he died, he went to the house of one of his closest friends and told him he had come to stay permanently. Every day he left the house early with a shovel, and it turned out that he spent three days digging his own grave. On the third day, he ate dinner, stood up and said, \"my time has come.\" He went into the next room, lay down, and died. He requested the following epitaph to be placed on his tombstone:\n\n{{cquote|The world tried to capture me, but didn't succeed.}}\n\nHe died on 9 November 1794 in the village called Pan-Ivanivka (today is Skovorodinovka, Zolochiv district, Kharkiv region)\n\n== Tributes ==\n[[File:USSR stamp G.Skovoroda 1972 4k.jpg|thumb|[[Postage stamps and postal history of Russia|Soviet stamp]] with portrait of H.

Gregory Skovoroda was very educated in different languages, in particular, Latin, Greek, German. He could read different religious literature in German language and, possibly, he was very influenced by German [[pietism]]. Brought up in a spirit of philosophical and religious studies, he became an opponent of church [[scholasticism]] and the spiritual dominance of the [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]]. \"Our kingdom is within us\" he wrote \"and to know God, you must know yourself...People should know God, like themselves, enough to see him in the world...Belief in God does not mean belief in his existence and therefore to give in to him and live according to His law... Sanctity of life lies in doing good to people.\"\n\nSkovoroda taught that \"all work is blessed by God\", but [[distribution of wealth]] outside the circle of God called unforgivable sin. Skovoroda taught that the only task of philosophy was to seek the truth and to pursue it. But in terms of human life, this goal is unattainable, and human happiness lies in the fact that everything has to find the truth. This goal can go in different directions, and intolerance of those who think differently, has no justification. Similarly, religious intolerance does not find justification for eternal truth revealed to the world in different forms. In relation to himself he was entirely uncompromising and as a result he achieved complete harmony between his teaching and his life. He was very gentle and observant in relation to others.\n[[File:Monument dedicated to Grigoriy Skovoroda.jpg|thumb|Monument dedicated to Gregory Skovoroda in Kyiv, Ukraine. The authors are [[Boris Krylov]] and Oles Sydoruk.]]\nIt was only in 1798 that his \"Narsisis or Know thyself\" was published in the Russian Empire, but without the inclusion of his name. In 1806 the magazine \"Zion Vyestnyk\" under the editorship of Alexander Labzin printed some more of his works. Then in Moscow in 1837\u20131839 a few of his works were published under his name, and only in 1861 the first almost complete collection of his works was published. On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the philosopher's death, in [[Kharkiv]] (Kharkov), the publication of the famous 7th volume of the ''Transactions of the Kharkov Historico-Philological Society'' (1894), edited by Dmitriy Bagaley (after 1918 also known as Dmytro Bahalii), contained the bulk of Skovoroda's oeuvre.<ref>Ushkalov, Leonid.

Formally he taught poetics in the Pereyaslav Collegium (during 1750-1751) and poetics, syntax, Greek and catechism at Kharkov Collegium (also called Kharkiv Collegium and in Latin: ''Collegium Charkoviensis'' or ''Zacharpolis Collegium''<ref>Grigory Savvich Skovoroda, Full collection of works, (Garden of Divine Songs), v. 2, in Teaching Thought, Kyiv 1973.</ref>) (during 1759-1760, 1761-1764, 1768-1769).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Skovoroda, Gregory S.

Young Skovoroda, confident in his mastery of the subject matter and in the precision, clarity and comprehensiveness of his rules of prosody, refused to comply with the bishop's order, asking for arbitration and pointing out to him that \"alia res sceptrum, alia plectrum\" [the pastor's scepter is one thing, but the flute is another]. The bishop considered Skovoroda's stance as arrogant and consequently he was dismissed.<ref>Skovoroda, Gregory S. Fables and Aphorisms. Translation, biography, and analysis by Dan B.

Probably he was also a private tutor for Gabriel Vishnevsky (1716\u20141752) (during 1745-1749), son of Fyodor Vishnevsky (1682\u20141749). Due to Fyodor Vishnevsky Skovoroda has visited Central Europe, especially Hungary and Austria.\n\nIn his teaching Skovoroda aimed at discovering the student's inclinations and abilities and devised talks and readings which would develop them to the fullest.<ref name=\"Skovoroda, Gregory S 1990, pg 42\">Skovoroda, Gregory S.

Haunted by worldly and spiritual powers, the philosopher led a life of an itinerant thinker-beggar. In his tracts and dialogs, biblical problems overlap with those examined earlier by [[Plato]] and the [[Stoicism|Stoics]]. Skovoroda's first book was issued after his death in 1798 in [[Saint Petersburg]]. Skovoroda's complete works were published for the first time in Saint Petersburg in 1861.

In 1741, at the age of 19 due to his uncle Ignatiy Poltavtsev he was taken from Kiev to sing in the imperial choir in [[Moscow]] and [[St. Petersburg]] returning to Kiev in 1744. He spent the period from 1745 to 1750 [[Kingdom of Hungary (1526\u20131867)|in the kingdom of Hungary]] and is thought to have traveled elsewhere in Europe during this period as well. In 1750 he returned to Kiev. From 1750\u20131751 he taught poetics in [[Pereiaslav]]. For most of the period from 1753 to 1759 Skovoroda was a tutor in the family of a landowner in Kovrai. From 1759 to 1769, with interruptions, he taught such subjects as poetry, [[syntax]], [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], and [[ethics]] at the Khark\u043ev Collegium (also called Kharkiv Collegium). After an attack on his course on ethics in 1769 he decided to abandon teaching.\n\nSkovoroda is known as a composer of [[liturgical music]], as well as a number of songs to his own texts. Of the latter, several have passed into the realm of [[Ukrainian folk music]]. Many of his philosophical songs known as \"Skovorodskie psalmy\" were often encountered in the repertoire of blind traveling folk musicians known as [[kobzar]]s. He was described as a proficient player on the [[flute]], [[torban]] and [[kobza]].\n\nIn the final quarter of his life he traveled by foot through Sloboda Ukraine staying with various friends, both rich and poor, preferring not to remain in one place for too long. During this time he dedicated himself to individual hermit-like monastic life and study.\n\nThis last period was the time of his great philosophic works. In this period as well, but particularly earlier, he wrote poetry and letters in [[Church Slavonic language]], Greek and [[Latin]] and did a number of translations from Latin into Russian.\n\n== Language ==\n{{One source|section|date=July 2014}}\n[[File:Skovoroda's fountain.jpg|thumb|Picture of the Skovorada's concept \"Unequal to all equality\"]]\nThere is much debate regarding the language Skovoroda used in his writings. Skovoroda used a form of written Ukrainian which differed somewhat from the [[vernacular]] Ukrainian. As a scholar studying in a religious institution that relied heavily on various forms of the [[Church Slavonic language|Church-Slavonic]] language although the foundation of his written language was Ukrainian.<ref name=\"George Y.

His poetry has been analysed for foreign non-Ukrainian elements. After an in depth study of Skovoroda's written works the Slavic linguist [[George Shevelov]] was able to deduce that apart from Ukrainian it contained 7.8% Russian, 7.7% non-Slavic, and 27.6% Church Slavonic vocabulary, and that the variant of Church Slavonic he used was the variety used in the Synodinal Bible of 1751.<ref name=\"George Y. Shevelov\" /> Skovoroda's prose however had a higher content of non-Ukrainian vocabulary: 36.7% Church Slavonic, 4.7% other non-Slavonic European languages, and 9.7% Russian.<ref name=\"George Y. Shevelov\" />\n\nAfter an [[Linguistic analysis|in depth analysis]] of Skovoroda's language, [[George Shevelov|G. Shevelov]] came to the conclusion that the high incidence of Church-Slavonic and the occurrence of Russian words reflect the circle of people with which Skovoroda primarily associated himself with, and on who he was materially dependent \u2013 and not the villagers and the village language that he knew and spoke.<ref name=\"George Y. Shevelov\" />\n\n[[George Shevelov]] concludes: \u2033In Summary, the language of Skovoroda, minus its many biblical and ecclesiastical, political and personal features is, in its foundation, the Slobozhanshchina variety of standard Russian as used by the educated\u2033.<ref name=\"George Y. Shevelov\" />\n\nSimilarly, Dan Chopyk describes the written language characteristics of Skovoroda's fables as mixed:\n\"His fables, written in a mixed Russian-Ukrainian-Church Slavonic language were, according to Gorkij and Tolstoy, very effective and, judging by the number of extant copies, were equally liked by gentry and commoners.\" <ref>Skovoroda, Gregory S. Fables and Aphorisms. Translation, biography, and analysis by Dan B. Chopyk (New York: Peter Lang, 1990) pg. 36</ref>\n\n== Death ==\n\nThree days before he died, he went to the house of one of his closest friends and told him he had come to stay permanently. Every day he left the house early with a shovel, and it turned out that he spent three days digging his own grave. On the third day, he ate dinner, stood up and said, \"my time has come.\" He went into the next room, lay down, and died. He requested the following epitaph to be placed on his tombstone:\n\n{{cquote|The world tried to capture me, but didn't succeed.}}\n\nHe died on 9 November 1794 in the village called Pan-Ivanivka (today is Skovorodinovka, Zolochiv district, Kharkiv region)\n\n== Tributes ==\n[[File:USSR stamp G.Skovoroda 1972 4k.jpg|thumb|[[Postage stamps and postal history of Russia|Soviet stamp]] with portrait of H.

Gregory Skovoroda was very educated in different languages, in particular, Latin, Greek, German. He could read different religious literature in German language and, possibly, he was very influenced by German [[pietism]]. Brought up in a spirit of philosophical and religious studies, he became an opponent of church [[scholasticism]] and the spiritual dominance of the [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]]. \"Our kingdom is within us\" he wrote \"and to know God, you must know yourself...People should know God, like themselves, enough to see him in the world...Belief in God does not mean belief in his existence and therefore to give in to him and live according to His law... Sanctity of life lies in doing good to people.\"\n\nSkovoroda taught that \"all work is blessed by God\", but [[distribution of wealth]] outside the circle of God called unforgivable sin. Skovoroda taught that the only task of philosophy was to seek the truth and to pursue it. But in terms of human life, this goal is unattainable, and human happiness lies in the fact that everything has to find the truth. This goal can go in different directions, and intolerance of those who think differently, has no justification. Similarly, religious intolerance does not find justification for eternal truth revealed to the world in different forms. In relation to himself he was entirely uncompromising and as a result he achieved complete harmony between his teaching and his life. He was very gentle and observant in relation to others.\n[[File:Monument dedicated to Grigoriy Skovoroda.jpg|thumb|Monument dedicated to Gregory Skovoroda in Kyiv, Ukraine. The authors are [[Boris Krylov]] and Oles Sydoruk.]]\nIt was only in 1798 that his \"Narsisis or Know thyself\" was published in the Russian Empire, but without the inclusion of his name. In 1806 the magazine \"Zion Vyestnyk\" under the editorship of Alexander Labzin printed some more of his works. Then in Moscow in 1837\u20131839 a few of his works were published under his name, and only in 1861 the first almost complete collection of his works was published. On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the philosopher's death, in [[Kharkiv]] (Kharkov), the publication of the famous 7th volume of the ''Transactions of the Kharkov Historico-Philological Society'' (1894), edited by Dmitriy Bagaley (after 1918 also known as Dmytro Bahalii), contained the bulk of Skovoroda's oeuvre.<ref>Ushkalov, Leonid.

Formally he taught poetics in the Pereyaslav Collegium (during 1750-1751) and poetics, syntax, Greek and catechism at Kharkov Collegium (also called Kharkiv Collegium and in Latin: ''Collegium Charkoviensis'' or ''Zacharpolis Collegium''<ref>Grigory Savvich Skovoroda, Full collection of works, (Garden of Divine Songs), v. 2, in Teaching Thought, Kyiv 1973.</ref>) (during 1759-1760, 1761-1764, 1768-1769).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Skovoroda, Gregory S.

Retrieved 24 November 2015</ref>\n\nIn 1751 he had a dispute with the presiding bishop of Pereyaslav Collegium who considered Skovoroda's new ways of teaching as strange and incompatible with the former traditional course of poetics. Young Skovoroda, confident in his mastery of the subject matter and in the precision, clarity and comprehensiveness of his rules of prosody, refused to comply with the bishop's order, asking for arbitration and pointing out to him that \"alia res sceptrum, alia plectrum\" [the pastor's scepter is one thing, but the flute is another]. The bishop considered Skovoroda's stance as arrogant and consequently he was dismissed.<ref>Skovoroda, Gregory S. Fables and Aphorisms. Translation, biography, and analysis by Dan B.

He not only excited his students with his lectures but his creative pedagogical approach also attracted the attention of his colleagues and even his superiors.<ref>Skovoroda, Gregory S.

Chopyk, New York: Peter Lang, 1990, pg 41.</ref>\n\nSkovoroda was also a private tutor for Vasily Tomara (1740\u20141813) (during 1753-1754, 1755-1758) and a mentor as well as a lifelong friend of Michael Kovalinsky (or Kovalensky, 1745\u20141807) (during 1761-1769), his biographer. Probably he was also a private tutor for Gabriel Vishnevsky (1716\u20141752) (during 1745-1749), son of Fyodor Vishnevsky (1682\u20141749). Due to Fyodor Vishnevsky Skovoroda has visited Central Europe, especially Hungary and Austria.\n\nIn his teaching Skovoroda aimed at discovering the student's inclinations and abilities and devised talks and readings which would develop them to the fullest.<ref name=\"Skovoroda, Gregory S 1990, pg 42\">Skovoroda, Gregory S. Fables and Aphorisms. Translation, biography, and analysis by Dan B. Chopyk, New York: Peter Lang, 1990, pg 42.</ref> This approach has been described by Skovoroda's biographer Kovalinsky:\n\"Skovoroda began [teaching young] Vasily Tomara by working more on the heart of his young disciple and, watching for his natural inclinations, he tried to help only the nature itself in developing him by engaging, light, and tender direction which the boy could not even notice, for Skovoroda paid particular attention not to overtax the young mind with [heavy] learning. In this way the boy became attached to Skovoroda with love [and trust for] him.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/><ref name=\"Skovoroda, Gregory S 1990, pg 42\"/>\n\nHis teaching was not limited to academia nor to private friends and during his later years as a \"wanderer\" he taught publicly the many who were drawn to him.

Vol. VI, pp. 60-61</ref>\n\nSkovoroda taught that one finds his true calling by self-examination. \"Know yourself,\" advises Skovoroda using the well known maxim of the Greek philosopher Socrates. He introduced a well founded idea that a person engaged in an in-born, natural work is provided with a truly satisfying and happy life.<ref>Skovoroda, Gregory S. Fables and Aphorisms.

In 1787, seven years before his death, Skovoroda wrote two essays,  ''The Noble Stork'' (in Original: ''\u0411\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0415\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0456\u0439'', ''Blagorodnyj Erodiy'') and ''The Poor Lark'' (in Original: ''\u0423\u0431\u043e\u0433\u0456\u0439 \u0416\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043a\u044a'', ''Ubogiy Zhavoronok''), devoted to the theme of education where he expounded his ideas.<ref>Skovoroda, Gregory S.

In fact, according to the 1983 Chronology of American Literature, the \"American Primitive,\" one of Oliver's collection of poems, \"...presents a new kind of Romanticism that refuses to acknowledge boundaries between nature and the observing self.\" <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://search-credoreference-com.lib.rockhurst.edu/content/entry/chronamlit/1983/0|title=The Chronology of American Literature|last=|first=|date=2004|website=|access-date=}}</ref> Her creativity was stirred by nature, and Oliver, an avid walker, often pursued inspiration on foot. Her poems are filled with imagery from her daily walks near her home:<ref name=\"Beaconpress\" /> shore birds, water snakes, the phases of the moon and humpback whales. In ''Long life'' she says  \"[I] go off to my woods, my ponds, my sun-filled harbor, no more than a blue comma on the map of the world but, to me, the emblem of everything.\"<ref name=\"Land\" /> She commented in a rare interview \"When things are going well, you know, the walk does not get rapid or get anywhere: I finally just stop, and write. That's a successful walk!\" She said that she once found herself walking in the woods with no pen and later hid pencils in the trees so she would never be stuck in that place again.<ref name=\"Land\" />  She often carried a 3-by-5-inch hand-sewn notebook for recording impressions and phrases.<ref name=\"Land\" /> [[Maxine Kumin]] called Oliver \"a patroller of wetlands in the same way that Thoreau was an inspector of snowstorms.\"<ref name=\"WRB\">Kumin, Maxine. \"Intimations of Mortality\". ''Women's Review of Books'' 10: April 7, 1993, p. 16.</ref> Oliver stated that her favorite poets were [[Walt Whitman]], [[Rumi]], [[Hafez]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] and [[John Keats]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOliver has also been compared to [[Emily Dickinson]], with whom she shared an affinity for solitude and inner monologues.  Her poetry combines dark introspection with joyous release.  Although she was criticized for writing poetry that assumes a dangerously close relationship between women and nature, she found that the self is only strengthened through an immersion with nature.<ref name=\"Graham\">Graham, p. 352</ref> Oliver is also known for her unadorned language and accessible themes.<ref name=\"AAP\">\"[http://www.poets.org/moliv Oliver Biography]\".

I don't know why I felt such an affinity with the natural world except that it was available to me, that's the first thing. It was right there.

If he left a will, it has not survived.{{sfn|Mann|2004}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==References==\n*{{Cite ODNB |last=Black |first=Joseph |year=2004 |title=Marprelate, Martin (fl. 1588\u20131589) |id=73908}}\n*{{Cite ODNB |last=Cross |first=Claire |year=2004 |title=Crane, Elizabeth (d. in or before 1606) |id=68274}}\n*{{Cite book |last=Dickson |first=Robert and John Philip Edmond |year=1890 |title=Annals of Scottish Printing, Part II |location=Cambridge |publisher=Macmillan and Bowes |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=3ftBAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA396 |accessdate=26 January 2013 |ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite DNB |wstitle=Waldegrave, Robert |volume=59 |pages=20\u201322 |ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite book |last=Duignan |first=W.H. |year=1905 |title=Worcestershire Place Names |location=London |publisher=Henry Frowde |url=https://archive.org/stream/worcestershirepl00duiguoft#page/22/mode/2up |accessdate=1 January 2014 |ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite journal |last=Jackson |first=William A. |year=1958 |title=Robert Waldegrave and the Books He Printed or Published in 1603 |editor1-last=Oates |editor1-first=J.C.T. |journal=The Library |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |series=4th |volume=XIII |pages=225\u201333 |ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite ODNB |last=Mann |first=A.J. |year=2004 |title=Waldegrave, Robert (c.1554\u20131603/4) |id=28441}} {{DNBfirst|wstitle=Waldegrave, Robert}}\n*{{Cite book |last=Pierce |first=William |year=1908 |title=A Historical Introduction to the Marprelate Tracts |location=London |publisher=Archibald Constable & Co.
