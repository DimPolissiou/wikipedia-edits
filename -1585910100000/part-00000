David Britt (London: Thames & Hudson Ltd., 1965); p. 85.</ref> He declared no single nationality and claimed instead to be \"a citizen of 20 countries\".{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\n==Career==\nCravan set out to promote himself as an eccentric poet and art critic, but his interest in art and literature was that of the provocateur which is typified by his claim in ''Maintenant'' (March \u2013 April 1914) that art is \"situated more in the guts than in the brain\" and that he wanted to 'break the face' of the modern art movement.<ref name=\":0\" /> He staged public spectacles with himself at the centre, once acting on the front of a line of carts where he paraded his skills as a boxer and singer. His proclivity for shock was what endeared him to the New York Dadaist movement, who adopted him as a poster boy after his death despite the fact Cravan never self-identified with the movement.\n\nFrom 1911 to 1915, Cravan published and edited a critical literary magazine, ''Maintenant!'' (\"Now!\"), which appeared in five issues and which he notoriously distributed around Paris with a wheelbarrow.<ref name=\":0\" /> It was gathered together and reprinted by [[Eric Losfeld]] in 1971 as ''J'\u00e9tais Cigare'' in the Dadaist collection \"Le D\u00e9sordre\".<ref name=\"Francaise' 1987, p.603\">''Dictionnaire des Litt\u00e9ratures de langue Francaise'' \u2013 Paris, Bordas, 1987, vol. 1, p.603</ref> The magazine was designed to cause sensation; in a piece about the 1914 arts salon, Cravan viciously criticised a self-portrait by [[Marie Laurencin]].

(\"Now!\"), which appeared in five issues and which he notoriously distributed around Paris with a wheelbarrow.<ref name=\":0\" /> It was gathered together and reprinted by [[Eric Losfeld]] in 1971 as ''J'\u00e9tais Cigare'' in the Dadaist collection \"Le D\u00e9sordre\".<ref name=\"Francaise' 1987, p.603\">''Dictionnaire des Litt\u00e9ratures de langue Francaise'' \u2013 Paris, Bordas, 1987, vol. 1, p.603</ref> The magazine was designed to cause sensation; in a piece about the 1914 arts salon, Cravan viciously criticised a self-portrait by [[Marie Laurencin]]. His remarks drove Laurencin's lover and influential modernist critic and poet [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] into a fury that resulted in a bid for a duel.

He was a professional between 1980 and 1995, riding for British teams.\n\nDoyle represented [[England at the 1978 Commonwealth Games|England]] and won two [[bronze medal]]s in the 4,000 metres individual and team pursuit events, at the [[1978 Commonwealth Games]] in [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]], [[Canada]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://teamengland.org/commonwealth-games-history/edmonton-1978/athletes|title=1978 Athletes|publisher=Team England}}</ref>\n\nHe finished seventh in the team pursuit at the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]] as part of the British team.<ref name=\"sportref\">{{cite web| url= https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/do/tony-doyle-1.html|title=Tony Doyle Biography & Statistics| publisher=Sports Reference|accessdate=2012-07-27}}</ref> He was not selected for the individual pursuit even though he was the national champion. The place went to [[Sean Yates]]. As a result, Doyle turned professional and won the world professional pursuit championship, beating [[Bert Oosterbosch]] and [[Herman Ponsteen]]. He then raced [[Six-day racing|six-day track races]] with a variety of partners before achieving great results partnering the Australian [[Danny Clark (cyclist)|Danny Clark]].\n\nDoyle became a regular in six-day track races during the 1980s, winning 23 six days. As a result, he was and still is Britain's most successful six day rider. He was noted for fluid and rapid pedalling, which brought him an unofficial UK time-trial record for 25 miles on a 72-inch gear in 56m 30s.\n\nIn 1989 Tony Doyle suffered from a serious head injury and multiple fractures at the Munich Six day. He was given the last rites and was in a coma for ten days. He spent six weeks in ITU, followed by two months in a rehabilitation centre. Due to the extent of his injuries it was predicted that he would be unable to return to professional racing.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nDoyle received the [[Frederick Thomas Bidlake|Bidlake Memorial Prize]] in 1980 following his first world championship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bidlakememorial.org.uk/Recipients.ht |title=The Recipients since 1933 when the Trust was formed |publisher=The F.

After, he remained in sport and in particular cycling. Doyle was elected President of [[British Cycling]] in late 1995 on a platform of increasing transparency and accountability. However, British Cycling's board attempted to remove him shortly afterwards: two weeks after this, he resigned.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/doyle-resigns-as-president-of-federation-1304172.html |title=Doyle resigns as president of federation |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=9 April 1996 |website=[[independent.co.uk]] |access-date=8 May 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/sproat-puts-a-spoke-in-cyclings-big-plans-1312454.html|title=Sproat puts a spoke in cycling's big plans |last=Blackhurst |first=Chris|author-link=Chris Blackhurst |date=1 December 1996|website=[[independent.co.uk]]|access-date=9 May 2018}}</ref> He was the founder director of the [[Tour of Britain]] which restarted in 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishcycling.org.uk/news/2004/09_september/08_Doyle.shtml |title=Tony Doyle |publisher=British Cycling |date=September 2004 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050911093324/http://www.britishcycling.org.uk/news/2004/09_september/08_Doyle.shtml |archivedate=11 September 2005 }}).

title=Anthony Doyle MBE|publisher=British Olympic Association}}</ref> is a British former professional cyclist.\n\n==Biography==\n\nDoyle was world pursuit champion in 1980 and 1986. He was a professional between 1980 and 1995, riding for British teams.\n\nDoyle represented [[England at the 1978 Commonwealth Games|England]] and won two [[bronze medal]]s in the 4,000 metres individual and team pursuit events, at the [[1978 Commonwealth Games]] in [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]], [[Canada]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://teamengland.org/commonwealth-games-history/edmonton-1978/athletes|title=1978 Athletes|publisher=Team England}}</ref>\n\nHe finished seventh in the team pursuit at the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]] as part of the British team.<ref name=\"sportref\">{{cite web| url= https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/do/tony-doyle-1.html|title=Tony Doyle Biography & Statistics| publisher=Sports Reference|accessdate=2012-07-27}}</ref> He was not selected for the individual pursuit even though he was the national champion. The place went to [[Sean Yates]]. As a result, Doyle turned professional and won the world professional pursuit championship, beating [[Bert Oosterbosch]] and [[Herman Ponsteen]]. He then raced [[Six-day racing|six-day track races]] with a variety of partners before achieving great results partnering the Australian [[Danny Clark (cyclist)|Danny Clark]].\n\nDoyle became a regular in six-day track races during the 1980s, winning 23 six days. As a result, he was and still is Britain's most successful six day rider. He was noted for fluid and rapid pedalling, which brought him an unofficial UK time-trial record for 25 miles on a 72-inch gear in 56m 30s.\n\nIn 1989 Tony Doyle suffered from a serious head injury and multiple fractures at the Munich Six day. He was given the last rites and was in a coma for ten days. He spent six weeks in ITU, followed by two months in a rehabilitation centre. Due to the extent of his injuries it was predicted that he would be unable to return to professional racing.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nDoyle received the [[Frederick Thomas Bidlake|Bidlake Memorial Prize]] in 1980 following his first world championship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bidlakememorial.org.uk/Recipients.ht |title=The Recipients since 1933 when the Trust was formed |publisher=The F.

After, he remained in sport and in particular cycling. Doyle was elected President of [[British Cycling]] in late 1995 on a platform of increasing transparency and accountability. However, British Cycling's board attempted to remove him shortly afterwards: two weeks after this, he resigned.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/doyle-resigns-as-president-of-federation-1304172.html |title=Doyle resigns as president of federation |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=9 April 1996 |website=[[independent.co.uk]] |access-date=8 May 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/sproat-puts-a-spoke-in-cyclings-big-plans-1312454.html|title=Sproat puts a spoke in cycling's big plans |last=Blackhurst |first=Chris|author-link=Chris Blackhurst |date=1 December 1996|website=[[independent.co.uk]]|access-date=9 May 2018}}</ref> He was the founder director of the [[Tour of Britain]] which restarted in 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishcycling.org.uk/news/2004/09_september/08_Doyle.shtml |title=Tony Doyle |publisher=British Cycling |date=September 2004 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050911093324/http://www.britishcycling.org.uk/news/2004/09_september/08_Doyle.shtml |archivedate=11 September 2005 }}).
