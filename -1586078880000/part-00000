It is an old northern tradition (probably originating in [[Tehran]]) that a raw egg yolk should be placed on top of the rice as well, though this is strictly optional, and most restaurants will not serve the rice this way unless it is specifically requested. \"Somagh\", powdered [[sumac]], is also made available and its use varies based on tastes to a small dash on the rice or a heavy sprinkling on both rice and meat, particularly when used with red (beef/veal/lamb) meat.\n\nAt Persian restaurants, the combination of one [[kabab barg]] and one [[kabab koobideh]] is typically called ''Soltani'', meaning \"sultan's feast\". The traditional beverage of choice to accompany kebab is [[doogh]], a sour yogurt drink with mint and salt.\n\nIn the old [[bazaar]] tradition, the rice (which is covered with a tin lid) and accompaniments are served first, immediately followed by the kebabs, which are brought to the table by the waiter, who holds several skewers in his left hand, and a piece of flat bread (typically nan-e lavash) in his right. A skewer is placed directly on the rice and while holding the kebab down on the rice with the bread, the skewer is quickly pulled out. With the two most common kebabs, [[Kabab barg|barg]] and [[Kabab koobideh|koobideh]], two skewers are always served.

This usage may be found in some non-English parts of Europe as well. In North America, the Greek variant gyros is most widely known.\n\nThe d\u00f6ner kebab originated in 19th century Turkey, but it became widely popular in the West only in the latter half of the 20th century. Many layers of meat are stacked onto a large vertical rotating spit; the outer surface is gradually cooked and sliced off, and typically served either mixed or topped with vegetables and sauces in a sandwich made with [[pita]] or other [[flatbreads]]. Certain regional variants also include cheeses. Sandwiches served in the same manner, but with other meats or cheese, may also sometimes be called a \"kebab\". It is available in most parts of Europe, and many other countries, though sometimes with different names or serving styles. In Germany, the highly popular sandwich, introduced by Turkish immigrants, is called a ''D\u00f6ner'', though Arab shops there serve ''shawarma''.<ref>[http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/travel/destinations/2010-04-11-germany-doner-kebab_N.htm Doner kebab becomes Germany's favorite fast food], ''USAToday'', 4/11/2010</ref>\n\n==Similar dishes==\n{{main|Skewer}}\n{{col begin}}\n{{col break}}\n\n;Americas\n*[[City chicken]] (U.S.)\n*[[Spiedie]]s ([[New York State]])\n*[[Anticucho]]s ([[Andean States|Andean]])\n*Espetinho ([[Brazilian cuisine|Brazilian]])\n{{col break}}\n;Asia\n*[[Kkochi]] and [[jeok]] ([[Korean cuisine|Korean]])\n*[[Kushiyaki]] and [[kushikatsu]] ([[Japanese cuisine|Japanese]])\n{{col break}}\n;Europe, Caucasus, central Asia\n*[[Kebakko]] ([[Finnish cuisine|Finnish]])\n*[[Brochette]] ([[French cuisine|French]])\n*[[Espetada]] ([[Portuguese cuisine|Portuguese]])\n*[[Souvlaki]] (\u03a3\u03bf\u03c5\u03b2\u03bb\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9; [[Greek cuisine|Greek]])\n*[[Arrosticini]] ([[Italian cuisine|Italian]])\n{{col end}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Food}}\n{{Commons category|Kebabs}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Afghan Cuisine]]\n* [[Arab cuisine]]\n* [[Armenian cuisine]]\n* [[Azerbaijani cuisine]]\n* [[Iranian cuisine]]\n* [[Iraqi cuisine]]\n* [[Israeli cuisine]]\n* [[Levantine cuisine]]\n* [[List of barbecue dishes]]\n* [[List of kebabs]]\n* [[List of spit-roasted foods]]\n* [[Ottoman cuisine]]\n* [[Syrian cuisine]]\n* [[Turkish cuisine]]\n* [[Pakistani cuisine]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Cuisine of Turkey}}\n{{Cuisine of Iran}}\n{{African cuisine}}\n{{Cuisine of the Levant}}\n{{Barbecue}}\n{{Meat|state=expanded}}\n{{Street food}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2011}}\n\n[[Category:Kebabs| ]]\n[[Category:Herb and spice mixtures]]\n[[Category:Skewered foods]]\n[[Category:Spit-cooked foods]]\n[[Category:Street food]]\n[[Category:Ancient dishes]]\n[[Category:Afghan cuisine]]\n[[Category:Arab cuisine]]\n[[Category:Palestinian cuisine]]\n[[Category:Lebanese cuisine]]\n[[Category:Armenian cuisine]]\n[[Category:Assyrian cuisine]]\n[[Category:Australian cuisine]]\n[[Category:Azerbaijani cuisine]]\n[[Category:Bengali cuisine]]\n[[Category:Balkan cuisine]]\n[[Category:Iranian cuisine]]\n[[Category:Iraqi cuisine]]\n[[Category:Israeli cuisine]]\n[[Category:Jordanian cuisine]]\n[[Category:Kurdish cuisine]]\n[[Category:Levantine cuisine]]\n[[Category:Pakistani cuisine]]\n[[Category:Middle Eastern grilled meats]]\n[[Category:Omani cuisine]]\n[[Category:Ottoman cuisine]]\n[[Category:South Asian cuisine]]\n[[Category:Syrian cuisine]]\n[[Category:Types of food]]\n[[Category:Food Watchlist Articles]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Variety of meat dishes originating in the Middle East}}\n{{Infobox food\n| name             = Kebab\n| image            = Lula kebab 2.jpg\n| image_size       = 275px\n| caption          = A typical ground meat kebab known by various names, which exists in many world cuisines\n| country         = [[Middle East]] \n| region           = \n| course           = Main course\n| served           = Hot\n| main_ingredient  = [[Meat]]\n}}\n'''Kebabs''' are various cooked meat [[dish (food)|dishes]], with their origins in [[Middle Eastern cuisine]].

Certain regional variants also include cheeses. Sandwiches served in the same manner, but with other meats or cheese, may also sometimes be called a \"kebab\". It is available in most parts of Europe, and many other countries, though sometimes with different names or serving styles. In Germany, the highly popular sandwich, introduced by Turkish immigrants, is called a ''D\u00f6ner'', though Arab shops there serve ''shawarma''.<ref>[http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/travel/destinations/2010-04-11-germany-doner-kebab_N.htm Doner kebab becomes Germany's favorite fast food], ''USAToday'', 4/11/2010</ref>\n\n==Similar dishes==\n{{main|Skewer}}\n{{col begin}}\n{{col break}}\n\n;Americas\n*[[City chicken]] (U.S.)\n*[[Spiedie]]s ([[New York State]])\n*[[Anticucho]]s ([[Andean States|Andean]])\n*Espetinho ([[Brazilian cuisine|Brazilian]])\n{{col break}}\n;Asia\n*[[Kkochi]] and [[jeok]] ([[Korean cuisine|Korean]])\n*[[Kushiyaki]] and [[kushikatsu]] ([[Japanese cuisine|Japanese]])\n{{col break}}\n;Europe, Caucasus, central Asia\n*[[Kebakko]] ([[Finnish cuisine|Finnish]])\n*[[Brochette]] ([[French cuisine|French]])\n*[[Espetada]] ([[Portuguese cuisine|Portuguese]])\n*[[Souvlaki]] (\u03a3\u03bf\u03c5\u03b2\u03bb\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9; [[Greek cuisine|Greek]])\n*[[Arrosticini]] ([[Italian cuisine|Italian]])\n{{col end}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Food}}\n{{Commons category|Kebabs}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Afghan Cuisine]]\n* [[Arab cuisine]]\n* [[Armenian cuisine]]\n* [[Azerbaijani cuisine]]\n* [[Iranian cuisine]]\n* [[Iraqi cuisine]]\n* [[Israeli cuisine]]\n* [[Levantine cuisine]]\n* [[List of barbecue dishes]]\n* [[List of kebabs]]\n* [[List of spit-roasted foods]]\n* [[Ottoman cuisine]]\n* [[Syrian cuisine]]\n* [[Turkish cuisine]]\n* [[Pakistani cuisine]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Cuisine of Turkey}}\n{{Cuisine of Iran}}\n{{African cuisine}}\n{{Cuisine of the Levant}}\n{{Barbecue}}\n{{Meat|state=expanded}}\n{{Street food}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2011}}\n\n[[Category:Kebabs| ]]\n[[Category:Herb and spice mixtures]]\n[[Category:Skewered foods]]\n[[Category:Spit-cooked foods]]\n[[Category:Street food]]\n[[Category:Ancient dishes]]\n[[Category:Afghan cuisine]]\n[[Category:Arab cuisine]]\n[[Category:Palestinian cuisine]]\n[[Category:Lebanese cuisine]]\n[[Category:Armenian cuisine]]\n[[Category:Assyrian cuisine]]\n[[Category:Australian cuisine]]\n[[Category:Azerbaijani cuisine]]\n[[Category:Bengali cuisine]]\n[[Category:Balkan cuisine]]\n[[Category:Iranian cuisine]]\n[[Category:Iraqi cuisine]]\n[[Category:Israeli cuisine]]\n[[Category:Jordanian cuisine]]\n[[Category:Kurdish cuisine]]\n[[Category:Levantine cuisine]]\n[[Category:Pakistani cuisine]]\n[[Category:Middle Eastern grilled meats]]\n[[Category:Omani cuisine]]\n[[Category:Ottoman cuisine]]\n[[Category:South Asian cuisine]]\n[[Category:Syrian cuisine]]\n[[Category:Types of food]]\n[[Category:Food Watchlist Articles]]\n", "name_user": "80.255.227.50", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kebab"}

It is located in [[Kalaw Township]] which is part of [[Taunggyi District]]. \nIt lies on the [[Thazi, Meiktila, Mandalay Region|Thazi]]-[[Kengtung|Kyaingtong]] road at an elevation of 4219 feet (1286 meters) above sea level. \n\nAs of September 2014, its population was recorded 30,313.\nIt is a junction town in the midst of agricultural villages and thus the majority of agricultural products (mainly potato, garlic, ginger, cabbage, tomato, cauliflower, avocado, orange, tea-leaves) from nearby towns and villages are all collected thereby traders and distributed to other parts of the country, especially to [[Yangon]], [[Mandalay]], [[Karen State|Kayin]] and [[Mon State|Mon]].\n\nThe single-line railway line was extended from [[Aungban|Aungpan]] to [[Shwenyaung]], in the 1920s  and [[Heho]], a small village of [[Danu people]] grew into a town. [[Heho]] was determined to be a convenient intermediate stop and transfer point.   Later an [[Heho Airport|airport]] was built, {{convert|4|km|abbr=on}} northwest of the town.  The [[airport]] served as an airbase both for the Allies and the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] during [[World War II]] and it was heavily bombed by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]].  Evidence of aircraft bunker revetments and bomb craters can still be seen on the southern end of the airfield, especially noticeable from the air.\n\n== Overview ==\n \nAs a trade hub in the region, more than half a dozen banks are being operated. As a logistically important place, most of the biggest companies in the country set up branch offices there, creating many employment opportunities for local people. Job opportunities vary from porters and lorry-drivers to mid-level management officers.\n\nThe town also plays a strategic role in military works that it has become an army base. The Seven-hundred bedded military hospital started its operation in the 2000s, providing healthcare service not only to military personnel but also to the wider public.\n\nRecent Town Committee's permit to set Aungpan's [[Pindaya]] exit road as an entertainment zone let KTVs mushroom along the road, forming as an only red-light district in the region. \nPin-hmi golf range which is located near the southern exit of the town is getting popular among local golfers and always crowded on weekends. Special tournaments are often held by the club, which is commonly sponsored by [[Kanbawza Bank|KBZ Bank]].\n\nThe Aungpan-[[Loikaw]] railroad was constructed in 1992. The condition of motorway from Aungpan to [[Loikaw]] was significantly improved over the past few years and local people no longer rely on train services nowadays.\n\nA recent boom in the tourism industry of [[Kalaw]] as a popular hiking spot and hill station has brought some impact to Aungpan as well. There are more than five hotels offering hundreds of rooms to visitors.\n\nDespite earning many municipal taxes from local businesses and people, township administrative parties were focusing mainly on [[Kalaw]] that the town grew double in size without proper city planning. There are no public amenities for the population and the private business sector starts to take chance by developing swimming pools, playground, football pitches, etc. around the town. \nThere is a small lake, named '''Mingalar Lake''' in '''Bahtoo Park'''. Once it was a collection of drain water discharged from living quarters. Renovation and restoration work for the park and the lake was carried out by the chairman of [[Kanbawza Bank|KBZ Bank]] and now it becomes a recreational place for the locals.\n\nThe motorway passing through '''Aungpan''' is upgraded to four-lane recently. Consequently, buildings fall under motorway's zoning undergone demolition. Captain Ba Htoo's (one of the most famous leaders during Burma's Independence Movement during the colonial period) Memorial Monument was destroyed and to be built back near the original place. Controversial and criticisms arose around the country for complete demolishment without considering for relocation. The construction of the Monument was completed and to be opened on March 27th, 2020. However, the opening ceremony was canceled due to the outbreak of '''Coronavirus disease 2019''' ('''COVID-19'''), an [[infectious disease]] caused by [[severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2]] in the country on March 23rd, 2020 reported by MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND SPORTS [https://www.mohs.gov.mm/]|.\nThe town's 100-years-anniversary clock-tower at the [[Pindaya]] junction was removed as well.\nUpgrade will be finished by April 2020 and now the town gets a newer look. \nHowever, the common use of motorway for the town's own traffic and speedy expressway vehicles is likely to lead accidents unless proper traffic regulation and enforcement are practiced.\n\n== Climate ==\nAungpan has a Dry-winter humid [[subtropical climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Cwa'').\n''Cwa'' is monsoonal influenced, having the classic dry winter \u2013 wet summer pattern associated with tropical monsoonal climates.\nThe weather is usually warm and temperate. When compared with winter, the summers have much more rainfall. \nThe average annual temperature in [[Aungban|Aungpan]] is 19.1 \u00b0C (66.3 \u00b0F). \nThe warmest month of the year is April, with an average temperature of 22.7 \u00b0C (72.9 \u00b0F). At 14.2 \u00b0C (57.6 \u00b0F) on average, January is the coldest month of the year.\nIn a year, the rainfall is 1654 mm (65.1 inches).\nThe difference in precipitation between the driest month and the wettest month is 290 mm (11 inches). \nThe variation in annual temperature is around 8.5 \u00b0C (47.3 \u00b0F).\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = [[Aungban|Aungpan]] (1982\u20132012)\n| single line  = Y\n| metric first = Y\n| width = auto\n\n| Jan low C = 6.8\n| Feb low C = 7.6\n| Mar low C = 11.9\n| Apr low C = 16.1\n| May low C = 17\n| Jun low C = 17.4\n| Jul low C = 17.4\n| Aug low C = 17.6\n| Sep low C = 17.1\n| Oct low C = 15.6\n| Nov low C = 11.7\n| Dec low C = 8.2\n| year low C = 13.7\n\n| Jan high C = 21.7\n| Feb high C = 23.3\n| Mar high C = 27.3\n| Apr high C = 29.3\n| May high C = 26.8\n| Jun high C = 24.7\n| Jul high C = 24.1\n| Aug high C = 24\n| Sep high C = 24.7\n| Oct high C = 24.3\n| Nov high C = 22.6\n| Dec high C = 20.9\n| year high C = 24.5\n\n| rain colour = green\n| Jan rain mm = 3\n| Feb rain mm = 5\n| Mar rain mm = 13\n| Apr rain mm = 50\n| May rain mm = 205\n| Jun rain mm = 244\n| Jul rain mm = 274\n| Aug rain mm = 293\n| Sep rain mm = 259\n| Oct rain mm = 209 \n| Nov rain mm = 84\n| Dec rain mm = 15\n| year rain mm = 137.8\n| source 1 = [[Norwegian Meteorological Institute]]<ref name=\"metno\">{{cite web | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20181008145507/http://met-xpprod.customer.enonic.io/publikasjoner/met-report/met-report-2017/_/attachment/download/a3bf1468-4e93-486a-aa3f-4bea3871cffa:b8f39ba9ecfbde7d7c6da8ca769f4a1a96d61d39/MyanmarClimateReportFINAL24Oct2017.pdf | archivedate = 8 October 2018 | url = http://met-xpprod.customer.enonic.io/publikasjoner/met-report/met-report-2017/_/attachment/download/a3bf1468-4e93-486a-aa3f-4bea3871cffa:b8f39ba9ecfbde7d7c6da8ca769f4a1a96d61d39/MyanmarClimateReportFINAL24Oct2017.pdf | title = Myanmar Climate Report | publisher = Norwegian Meteorological Institute | pages =23\u201336  | accessdate = 28 October 2018}}</ref> \n}}\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe town is home to:\n* Regional campus '''[[Yezin Agricultural University]] (YAU)''' \n\nEducation service centers are also getting common in the town for a decade ago.

The aim is to \"expose students to their specialized crop and do more research in order to become crop specialists\". The undergraduate students come to Aungpan branch to study and do research on maize and cereals.\nThe Seven-hundred bed military hospital also serves as a teaching hospital for Defence Service Medical Academy's house surgeons from [[Yangon]]. Therefore, several students of various age-levels can be seen in the town.\n\n== Health care ==\n\n=== Public Hospitals ===\n* Aungpan General Hospital\n* 700-bed military Hospital\n* Gayunar Yike Nyein Clinic ({{my|\u1000\u101b\u102f\u100f\u102c\u101b\u102d\u1015\u103a\u1004\u103c\u102d\u1019\u103a\u1006\u1031\u1038\u1001\u1014\u103a\u1038}})\n\n==Aungchanthar Pagoda==\n[[File:Aung Chan Thar Pagoda1.jpg|thumb|right|Aung Chan Thar Pagoda under construction.

It was founded on July 20th, 2005 \u2013 the full moon day of [[Waso]], (1367 in the [[Myanmar]] calendar). Its name literally means \u201cVictory and Prosperity\u201d.\n\nLeading the project is U Pyinnya Wunsa (68 years old), the abbot of Aungchanthar monastery and a member of the State Sangha Maha Nayaka Committee, locally known as Aungchanthar Sayadaw. \n\n[[File: Aung Chan Thar Pagoda2.jpg|thumb|left|Aung Chan Thar Pagoda under construction. (February, 2020)]]\n \nThere is still a lot of work to do until the Pagoda is complete.\nHe decided to build the Pagoda because '''Aungpan''' is at the center of several famous places in the region, such as [[Inle Lake]] and [[Pindaya Caves|Pindaya]], and visitors frequently ask him why the town doesn't have any sacred pagoda. \n\nIt has been under construction for about fifteen years. It had been spent about [[Kyat]] six billion (about [[US$]] 6 million) on the pagoda and it's about two-third finished. In 2005, it was estimated to cost about [[Kyat]] 7.6 billion. \n\nThe project has been really quite slow in the past ten years but visitors to the region often want to donate after hearing about the project. Now the project is moving much faster.\n\n[[File:Interior structure of pagoda.jpg|thumb|left|The interior structure of pagoda. (February, 2020)]]\n\nWhen completed, the pagoda will be encircled by 107 smaller stupas, ranging in height from 6 feet (1.8 meters) to 12 feet (3.6 meters). \nWhile Aungchanthar Pagoda will replicate [[Shwedagon Pagoda]], it will also incorporate a hollow interior.\n\nLocals are very pleased that they would soon have a major religious site in their town and it would improve the town's image.\n\n==References==\n<ref>mmtimes.com/national-news/4539-aungban-builds-shwedagon-replica.html</ref>\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.maplandia.com/burma/shan/kalaw/aungban/ Satellite map at Maplandia.com]\n\n{{Kalaw Township}}\n{{Shan State}}\n\n[[Category:Populated places in Taunggyi District]]\n[[Category:Kalaw Township]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox settlement\n| native_name = {{my|\u1021\u1031\u102c\u1004\u103a\u1015\u1014\u103a\u1038\u1019\u103c\u102d\u102f\u1037}}\n| official_name = Aungpan\n|pushpin_map = Burma\n|pushpin_map_caption = Location in Burma\n|image_skyline = Aungban.jpg\n|image_map = \n|subdivision_type = Country\n|subdivision_name = {{Flag|Myanmar}}\n|subdivision_type1 = [[Administrative divisions of Burma|State]]\n|subdivision_name1 = {{flag|Shan State}}\n|subdivision_type2 = [[Districts of Burma|Districts]]\n|subdivision_name2 = [[Taunggyi District]]\n|subdivision_type3 = Township\n|subdivision_name3 = [[Kalaw Township]]\n|unit_pref = Imperial\n|area_total_km2 = \n|population = \n|population_as_of = 2014\n\n|population_blank1            = [[Shan people|Shan]], [[Danu people|Danu]], [[Bamar]], [[Pa-O]], [[Taungyo]], [[Burmese Chinese]], [[Burmese Indians]], [[Burmese Gurkha|Gurkha]]\n|population_blank1_title     = Ethnicities\n|population_blank2 = [[Theravada Buddhism]], [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Hinduism]]\n|population_blank2_title = Religions\n|population_density_km2 = auto\n|population_total = 30,313\n\n| map_caption                     = \n| pushpin_map                     = Myanmar#Asia\n| pushpin_label_position          = bottom\n| pushpin_map_caption             = Location of Aungpan, Myanmar\n| coordinates                     = {{coord|20|40|0|N|96|38|0|E|type:town_region:MM|display=inline,title}}\n\n\n|leader_title = Mayor\n|established_date = 1913\n|established_title = Founded\n|elevation_ft = 4219\n|elevation_m =  1286\n|timezone = [[Time in Burma|MST]]\n|utc_offset               = +6.30\n|area_code                = 081\n|postal_code_type         = [[Postal code]] [http://www.myanmaposts.net.mm/]\n|postal_code              = 06022\n|registration_plate       = SHN\n| blank_name_sec1 = [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|Climate]]\n| blank_info_sec1 = [[Humid subtropical climate]] (Cwa)\n|website                  =\n}}\n\n'''Aungpan''' ({{lang-my|\u1021\u1031\u102c\u1004\u103a\u1015\u1014\u103a\u1038\u1019\u103c\u102d\u102f\u1037}}) is a town located in the Southern [[Shan State]].

At 14.2 \u00b0C (57.6 \u00b0F) on average, January is the coldest month of the year.\nIn a year, the rainfall is 1654 mm (65.1 inches).\nThe difference in precipitation between the driest month and the wettest month is 290 mm (11 inches). \nThe variation in annual temperature is around 8.5 \u00b0C (47.3 \u00b0F).\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = [[Aungban|Aungpan]] (1982\u20132012)\n| single line  = Y\n| metric first = Y\n| width = auto\n\n| Jan low C = 6.8\n| Feb low C = 7.6\n| Mar low C = 11.9\n| Apr low C = 16.1\n| May low C = 17\n| Jun low C = 17.4\n| Jul low C = 17.4\n| Aug low C = 17.6\n| Sep low C = 17.1\n| Oct low C = 15.6\n| Nov low C = 11.7\n| Dec low C = 8.2\n| year low C = 13.7\n\n| Jan high C = 21.7\n| Feb high C = 23.3\n| Mar high C = 27.3\n| Apr high C = 29.3\n| May high C = 26.8\n| Jun high C = 24.7\n| Jul high C = 24.1\n| Aug high C = 24\n| Sep high C = 24.7\n| Oct high C = 24.3\n| Nov high C = 22.6\n| Dec high C = 20.9\n| year high C = 24.5\n\n| rain colour = green\n| Jan rain mm = 3\n| Feb rain mm = 5\n| Mar rain mm = 13\n| Apr rain mm = 50\n| May rain mm = 205\n| Jun rain mm = 244\n| Jul rain mm = 274\n| Aug rain mm = 293\n| Sep rain mm = 259\n| Oct rain mm = 209 \n| Nov rain mm = 84\n| Dec rain mm = 15\n| year rain mm = 137.8\n| source 1 = [[Norwegian Meteorological Institute]]<ref name=\"metno\">{{cite web | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20181008145507/http://met-xpprod.customer.enonic.io/publikasjoner/met-report/met-report-2017/_/attachment/download/a3bf1468-4e93-486a-aa3f-4bea3871cffa:b8f39ba9ecfbde7d7c6da8ca769f4a1a96d61d39/MyanmarClimateReportFINAL24Oct2017.pdf | archivedate = 8 October 2018 | url = http://met-xpprod.customer.enonic.io/publikasjoner/met-report/met-report-2017/_/attachment/download/a3bf1468-4e93-486a-aa3f-4bea3871cffa:b8f39ba9ecfbde7d7c6da8ca769f4a1a96d61d39/MyanmarClimateReportFINAL24Oct2017.pdf | title = Myanmar Climate Report | publisher = Norwegian Meteorological Institute | pages =23\u201336  | accessdate = 28 October 2018}}</ref> \n}}\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe town is home to:\n* Regional campus '''[[Yezin Agricultural University]] (YAU)''' \n\nEducation service centers are also getting common in the town for a decade ago.

The aim is to \"expose students to their specialized crop and do more research in order to become crop specialists\". The undergraduate students come to Aungpan branch to study and do research on maize and cereals.\nThe Seven-hundred bed military hospital also serves as a teaching hospital for Defence Service Medical Academy's house surgeons from [[Yangon]]. Therefore, several students of various age-levels can be seen in the town.\n\n== Health care ==\n\n=== Public Hospitals ===\n* Aungpan General Hospital\n* 700-bed military Hospital\n* Gayunar Yike Nyein Clinic ({{my|\u1000\u101b\u102f\u100f\u102c\u101b\u102d\u1015\u103a\u1004\u103c\u102d\u1019\u103a\u1006\u1031\u1038\u1001\u1014\u103a\u1038}})\n\n==Aungchanthar Pagoda==\n[[File:Aung Chan Thar Pagoda1.jpg|thumb|right|Aung Chan Thar Pagoda under construction. (February, 2020)]]\n\nLocals in the town hope that an ongoing pagoda project of '''Aungchanthar Pagoda''' will change visitors\u2019 perceptions of their hometown and will become the landmark and symbol of the religion. \n'''Aungchanthar Pagoda''' is a 162-foot (48.5-meter) replica of [[Yangon]]'s [[Shwedagon Pagoda]]. It was founded on July 20th, 2005 \u2013 the full moon day of [[Waso]], (1367 in the [[Myanmar]] calendar). Its name literally means \u201cVictory and Prosperity\u201d.\n\nLeading the project is U Pyinnya Wunsa (68 years old), the abbot of Aungchanthar monastery and a member of the State Sangha Maha Nayaka Committee, locally known as Aungchanthar Sayadaw. \n\n[[File: Aung Chan Thar Pagoda2.jpg|thumb|left|Aung Chan Thar Pagoda under construction. (February, 2020)]]\n \nThere is still a lot of work to do until the Pagoda is complete.\nHe decided to build the Pagoda because '''Aungpan''' is at the center of several famous places in the region, such as [[Inle Lake]] and [[Pindaya Caves|Pindaya]], and visitors frequently ask him why the town doesn't have any sacred pagoda. \n\nIt has been under construction for about fifteen years. It had been spent about [[Kyat]] six billion (about [[US$]] 6 million) on the pagoda and it's about two-third finished. In 2005, it was estimated to cost about [[Kyat]] 7.6 billion. \n\nThe project has been really quite slow in the past ten years but visitors to the region often want to donate after hearing about the project. Now the project is moving much faster.\n\n[[File:Interior structure of pagoda.jpg|thumb|left|The interior structure of pagoda. (February, 2020)]]\n\nWhen completed, the pagoda will be encircled by 107 smaller stupas, ranging in height from 6 feet (1.8 meters) to 12 feet (3.6 meters). \nWhile Aungchanthar Pagoda will replicate [[Shwedagon Pagoda]], it will also incorporate a hollow interior.\n\nLocals are very pleased that they would soon have a major religious site in their town and it would improve the town's image.\n\n==References==\n<ref>mmtimes.com/national-news/4539-aungban-builds-shwedagon-replica.html</ref>\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.maplandia.com/burma/shan/kalaw/aungban/ Satellite map at Maplandia.com]\n\n{{Kalaw Township}}\n{{Shan State}}\n\n[[Category:Populated places in Taunggyi District]]\n[[Category:Kalaw Township]]\n", "name_user": "Kmthu.ytu", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aungban"}
