Herrnstein]] and political scientist [[Charles Murray (political scientist)|Charles Murray]], in which the authors argue that [[human intelligence]] is substantially influenced by both inherited and environmental factors and that it is a better predictor of many personal outcomes, including financial income, job performance, birth out of [[marriage|wedlock]], and involvement in crime than are an individual's parental [[socioeconomic status]]. They also argue that those with high intelligence, the \"cognitive elite\", are becoming separated from those of average and below-average intelligence. The book was controversial, especially where the authors wrote about [[Race and intelligence|racial differences in intelligence]] and discussed the implications of those differences.\n\nShortly after its publication, many people rallied both in criticism and defense of the book. A number of critical texts were written in response to it.\n\n==Synopsis==\n{{One source|section|date=December 2019}} \n\n''The Bell Curve'', published in 1994, was written by Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray to explain the variations in intelligence in American society, warn of some consequences of that variation, and propose social policies for mitigating the worst of the consequences. The book's title comes from the bell-shaped [[normal distribution]] of [[intelligence quotient]] (IQ) scores in a population.\n\n===Introduction===\n\nThe book starts with an introduction that appraises the history of the concept of intelligence from [[Francis Galton]] to modern times. Spearman's introduction of the [[g factor (psychometrics)|general factor of intelligence]] and other early advances in research on intelligence are discussed along with a consideration of links between intelligence testing and racial politics. The 1960s are identified as the period in American history when social problems were increasingly attributed to forces outside the individual. This egalitarian ethos, Herrnstein and Murray argue, cannot accommodate biologically based individual differences.<ref name=\"devlin\">{{cite book| title= Intelligence, Genes, and Success: Scientists Respond to The Bell Curve| url= https://archive.org/details/intelligencegene00bern| url-access= registration| first1= Bernie| last1= Devlin | first2= Stephen E. | last2= Fienberg| first3=  Daniel P. | last3= Resnick| first4= Kathryn | last4= Roeder|author4-link= Kathryn Roeder |  publisher= Springer Science & Business Media| year= 1997 | isbn= 978-0387949864}}</ref>\n\nThe introduction states six of the authors' assumptions, which they claim to be \"beyond significant technical dispute\":<ref name=\"HerrnsteinMurray2010\">{{cite book|first1= Richard J. |last1= Herrnstein| first2= Charles |last2= Murray| title= Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s4CKqxi6yWIC|date=11 May 2010 |publisher=Simon and Schuster| isbn= 978-1-4391-3491-7| pages= 22\u201323}}</ref>\n# There is such a difference as a general factor of cognitive ability on which human beings differ.\n# All standardized tests of academic aptitude or achievement measure this general factor to some degree, but IQ tests expressly designed for that purpose measure it most accurately.\n# IQ scores match, to a first degree, whatever it is that people mean when they use the word intelligent, or smart in ordinary language.\n# IQ scores are stable, although not perfectly so, over much of a person's life.\n# Properly administered IQ tests are not demonstrably biased against social, economic, ethnic, or racial groups.\n# Cognitive ability is substantially [[Heritability|heritable]], apparently no less than 40 percent and no more than 80 percent.\nAt the close of the introduction, the authors warn the reader against committing the [[ecological fallacy]] of inferring things about individuals based on the aggregate data presented in the book. They also assert that intelligence is just one of many valuable human attributes and one whose importance among human virtues is overrated.<ref name=\"devlin\"/>\n\n===Part I. The Emergence of a Cognitive Elite===\n\nIn the first part of the book Herrnstein and Murray chart how American society was transformed in the 20th century. They argue that America evolved from a society where social origin largely determined one's social status to one where cognitive ability is the leading determinant of status. The growth in college attendance, a more efficient recruitment of cognitive ability, and the sorting of cognitive ability by selective colleges are identified as important drivers of this evolution. Increased occupational sorting by cognitive ability is discussed. The argument is made, based on published meta-analyses, that cognitive ability is the best predictor of worker productivity.<ref name=\"devlin\"/>\n\nHerrnstein and Murray argue that due to increasing returns to cognitive ability, a cognitive elite is being formed in America. This elite is getting richer and progressively more segregated from the rest of society.<ref name=\"devlin\"/>\n\n===Part II. Cognitive Classes and Social Behavior===\n\nThe second part describes how cognitive ability is related to social behaviors: high ability predicts socially desirable behavior, low ability undesirable behavior. The argument is made that group differences in social outcomes are better explained by intelligence differences rather than socioeconomic status, a perspective, the authors argue, that has been neglected in research.<ref name=\"devlin\"/>\n\nThe analyses reported in this part of the book were done using data from the [[National Longitudinal Surveys|National Longitudinal Survey of Labor Market Experience of Youth]] (NLSY), a study conducted by the [[United States Department of Labor]]'s [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] tracking thousands of Americans starting in the 1980s. Only [[non-Hispanic white]]s are included in the analyses so as to demonstrate that the relationships between cognitive ability and social behavior are not driven by race or ethnicity.<ref name=\"devlin\"/>\n\nHerrnstein and Murray argue that intelligence is a better predictor of individuals' outcomes than parental socioeconomic status. This argument is based on analyses where individuals' IQ scores are shown to better predict their outcomes as adults than the socioeconomic status of their parents. Such results are reported for many outcomes, including poverty, dropping out of school, unemployment, marriage, divorce, illegitimacy, welfare dependency, criminal offending, and the probability of voting in elections.<ref name=\"devlin\"/>\n\nAll participants in the NLSY took the [[Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery]] (ASVAB), a battery of ten tests taken by all who apply for entry into the armed services. (Some had taken an IQ test in high school, and the median correlation of the [[Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery#Armed Forces Qualification Test|Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT)]] scores and those IQ test scores was .81). Participants were later evaluated for social and economic outcomes. In general, IQ/AFQT scores were a better predictor of life outcomes than [[social class]] background. Similarly, after statistically controlling for differences in IQ, many outcome differences between racial-ethnic groups disappeared.{{fact|date=December 2019}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Economic and social correlates of IQ\n!

The National Context===\n\nThis part of the book discusses ethnic differences in cognitive ability and social behavior. Herrnstein and Murray report that Asian Americans have a higher mean IQ than white Americans, who in turn outscore black Americans. The book argues that the black-white gap is not due to test bias, noting that IQ tests do not tend to underpredict the school or job performance of black individuals and that the gap is larger on apparently culturally neutral test items than on more culturally loaded items. The authors also note that adjusting for socioeconomic status does not eliminate the black-white IQ gap. However, they argue that the gap is narrowing.<ref name=\"devlin\"/>\n\nAccording to Herrnstein and Murray, the high [[heritability of IQ]] within races does not necessarily mean that the cause of differences between races is genetic. On the other hand, they discuss lines of evidence that have been used to support the thesis that the black-white gap is at least partly genetic, such as [[Spearman's hypothesis]]. They also discuss possible environmental explanations of the gap, such as the observed generational increases in IQ, for which they coin the term [[Flynn effect]]. At the close of this discussion, they write:<ref name=\"devlin\"/>\n\n{{quote|\"If the reader is now convinced that either the genetic or environmental explanation has won out to the exclusion of the other, we have not done a sufficiently good job of presenting one side or the other. It seems highly likely to us that both genes and environment have something to do with racial differences. What might the mix be? We are resolutely agnostic on that issue; as far as we can determine, the evidence does not yet justify an estimate.\"}}\n\nThe authors also stress that regardless of the causes of differences, people should be treated no differently.<ref name=\"devlin\"/>\n\nIn Part III, the authors also repeat many of the analyses from Part II, but now compare whites to blacks and Hispanics in the NLSY dataset. They find that after controlling for IQ, many differences in social outcomes between races are diminished.<ref name=\"devlin\"/>\n\nThe authors discuss the possibility that high birth rates among those with lower IQs may exert a downward pressure on the national distribution of cognitive ability. They argue that immigration may also have a similar effect.<ref name=\"devlin\"/>\n\nAt the close of Part III, Herrnstein and Murray discuss the relation of IQ to social problems. Using the NLSY data, they show that social problems increase as a monotonic function of lower IQ.<ref name=\"devlin\"/>\n\n===Living Together===\n\nIn this final chapter, the authors discuss the relevance of cognitive ability for understanding major social issues in America.<ref name=\"devlin\"/>\n\nEvidence for experimental attempts to raise intelligence is reviewed. The authors conclude that currently there are no means to boost intelligence by more than a modest degree.<ref name=\"devlin\"/>\n\nThe authors criticize the \"levelling\" of general and secondary education and defend [[gifted education]]. They offer a critical overview of [[affirmative action]] policies in colleges and workplaces, arguing that their goal should be equality of opportunity rather than equal outcomes.<ref name=\"devlin\"/>\n\nHerrnstein and Murray offer a pessimistic portrait of America's future. They predict that a cognitive elite will further isolate itself from the rest of society, while the quality of life deteriorates for those at the bottom of the cognitive scale. As an antidote to this prognosis, they offer a vision of society where differences in ability are recognized and everybody can have a valued place, stressing the role of local communities and clear moral rules that apply to everybody.<ref name=\"devlin\"/>\n\n==Policy recommendations==\n{{Primary sources|section|date=December 2019}}\nHerrnstein and Murray argued the average genetic IQ of the United States is declining, owing to the tendency of the more intelligent having fewer children than the less intelligent, the generation length to be shorter for the less intelligent, and the large-scale immigration to the United States of those with low intelligence. Discussing a possible future political outcome of an intellectually stratified society, the authors stated that they \"fear that a new kind of conservatism is becoming the dominant ideology of the affluent\u2014not in the social tradition of an Edmund Burke or in the economic tradition of an Adam Smith but 'conservatism' along Latin American lines, where to be conservative has often meant doing whatever is necessary to preserve the mansions on the hills from the menace of the slums below.\"<ref>p.&nbsp;518.</ref> Moreover, they fear that increasing welfare will create a \"custodial state\" in \"a high-tech and more lavish version of the Indian reservation for some substantial minority of the nation's population.\" They also predict increasing [[totalitarianism]]: \"It is difficult to imagine the United States preserving its heritage of individualism, equal rights before the law, free people running their own lives, once it is accepted that a significant part of the population must be made permanent wards of the states.\"<ref>p.&nbsp;526.</ref>\n\nThe authors recommended the elimination of welfare policies that encourage poor women to have babies:\n\n{{quote|We can imagine no recommendation for using the government to manipulate fertility that does not have dangers. But this highlights the problem: The United States already has policies that inadvertently social-engineer who has babies, and it is encouraging the wrong women. \"If the United States did as much to encourage high-IQ women to have babies as it now does to encourage low-IQ women, it would rightly be described as engaging in aggressive manipulation of fertility.\" The technically precise description of America's fertility policy is that it subsidizes births among poor women, who are also disproportionately at the low end of the intelligence distribution. We urge generally that these policies, represented by the extensive network of cash and services for low-income women who have babies, be ended. The government should stop subsidizing births to anyone rich or poor. The other generic recommendation, as close to harmless as any government program we can imagine, is to make it easy for women to make good on their prior decision not to get pregnant by making available birth control mechanisms that are increasingly flexible, foolproof, inexpensive, and safe.<ref>pp. 548\u2013549.</ref>}}\n\n==Media reception==\n''The Bell Curve'' received a great deal of media attention.

They found that if IQ scores are adjusted, as Herrnstein and Murray did, to eliminate the effect of [[education]], the ability of IQ to predict [[poverty]] can become dramatically larger, by as much as 61 percent for whites and 74 percent for blacks. According to the authors, Herrnstein and Murray's finding that IQ predicts poverty much better than socioeconomic status is substantially a result of the way they handled the statistics.<ref>''[http://press.princeton.edu/titles/5877.html Inequality by Design: Cracking the Bell Curve Myth]'' Claude S.

Korenman and Winship concluded: \"...{{nbsp}}there is evidence of substantial bias due to measurement error in their estimates of the effects of parents' socioeconomic status. In addition, Herrnstein and Murray's measure of parental socioeconomic status (SES) fails to capture the effects of important elements of family background (such as single-parent family structure at age 14). As a result, their analysis gives an exaggerated impression of the importance of IQ relative to parents' SES, and relative to family background more generally. Estimates based on a variety of methods, including analyses of siblings, suggest that parental family background is at least as important, and may be more important than IQ in determining socioeconomic success in adulthood.\"<ref>http://ssrn.com/abstract=225294 Korenman, Sanders and Winship, Christopher, \"A Reanalysis of The Bell Curve\" (August 1995).

He continues:\n\n{{quote|Ironically, the authors delete from their composite AFQT score a timed test of numerical operations because it is not highly correlated with the other tests. Yet it is well known that in the data they use, this subtest is the single best predictor of earnings of all the AFQT test components. The fact that many of the subtests are only weakly correlated with each other, and that the best predictor of earnings is only weakly correlated with their \"g-loaded\" score, only heightens doubts that a single-ability model is a satisfactory description of human intelligence. It also drives home the point that the \"g-loading\" so strongly emphasized by Murray and Herrnstein measures only agreement among tests\u2014not predictive power for socioeconomic outcomes. By the same token, one could also argue that the authors have biased their empirical analysis against the conclusions they obtain by disregarding the test with the greatest predictive power.<ref name=heckman/><ref name=\"reason\">''[http://www.reason.com/news/show/29636.html Cracked Bell]'' James J.

Thus, rather than higher IQ leading to status attainment because it indicates skills needed in a modern society, IQ may reflect the same test-taking abilities used in artificial screening devices by which status groups protect their domains.<ref>\"IQ and Stratification: An Empirical Evaluation of Herrnstein and Murray's Social Change Argument\".

Hauser]] write that Herrnstein and Murray provide scant evidence of growth in cognitive sorting. Using data from the General Social Survey, they tested each of these hypotheses using a short verbal ability test which was administered to about 12,500 American adults between 1974 and 1994; the results provided no support for any of the trend hypotheses advanced by Herrnstein and Murray. One chart in ''The Bell Curve'' purports to show that people with IQs above 120 have become \"rapidly more concentrated\" in high-IQ occupations since 1940. But Robert Hauser and his colleague Min-Hsiung Huang retested the data and came up with estimates that fell \"well below those of Herrnstein and Murray.\" They add that the data, properly used, \"do not tell us anything except that selected, highly educated occupation groups have grown rapidly since 1940.\"<ref>''[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ap/so/1997/00000026/00000003/art00604 Verbal Ability and Socioeconomic Success: A Trend Analysis]'' Hauser R.M.; Huang M.H.</ref>\n\nIn 1972, [[Noam Chomsky]] questioned Herrnstein's idea that society was developing towards a [[meritocracy]]. Chomsky criticized the assumptions that people only seek occupations based on material gain. He argued that Herrnstein would not want to become a baker or lumberjack even if he could earn more money that way. He also criticized the assumption that such a society would be fair with pay based on value of contributions. He argued that because there are already unjust great inequalities, people will often be paid, not for valuable contributions to society, but to preserve such inequalities.<ref name=Chomsky>Chomsky, Noam. 1972. \"[http://newlearningonline.com/new-learning/chapter-6-the-nature-of-learning/chomsky-on-iq-and-inequality/ Chomsky on IQ and inequality I.Q.

The authors were reported throughout the popular press as arguing that these IQ differences are strictly genetic, when in fact they attributed IQ differences to both genes and the environment in chapter 13: \"It seems highly likely to us that both genes and the environment have something to do with racial differences.\" The introduction to the chapter more cautiously states, \"The debate about whether and how much genes and environment have to do with ethnic differences remains unresolved.\"\n\nWhen several prominent critics turned this into an \"assumption\" that the authors had attributed most or all of the racial differences in IQ to genes, co-author Charles Murray responded by quoting two passages from the book:\n* If the reader is now convinced that either the genetic or environmental explanation has won out to the exclusion of the other, we have not done a sufficiently good job of presenting one side or the other. It seems highly likely to us that both genes and the environment have something to do with racial differences. What might the mix be? We are resolutely agnostic on that issue; as far as we can determine, the evidence does not justify an estimate.

So did white mountaineer children in the United States tested back in the early 1930s ... Strangely, Herrnstein and Murray refer to \"folklore\" that \"Jews and other immigrant groups were thought to be below average in intelligence.\" It was neither folklore nor anything as subjective as thoughts. It was based on hard data, as hard as any data in ''The Bell Curve''. These groups repeatedly tested below average on the mental tests of the World War I era, both in the army and in civilian life. For Jews, it is clear that later tests showed radically different results\u2014during an era when there was very little intermarriage to change the genetic makeup of American Jews.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://search.opinionarchives.com/Summary/AmericanSpectator/V28I2P32-1.htm|title=Ethnicity and IQ|first=Thomas|last=Sowell|year=1995|volume=28|issue=2|journal=[[The American Spectator]]}}</ref>}}\n\n[[J.

Herrnstein]] and political scientist [[Charles Murray (political scientist)|Charles Murray]], in which the authors argue that [[human intelligence]] is substantially influenced by both inherited and environmental factors and that it is a better predictor of many personal outcomes, including financial income, job performance, birth out of [[marriage|wedlock]], and involvement in crime than are an individual's parental [[socioeconomic status]]. They also argue that those with high intelligence, the \"cognitive elite\", are becoming separated from those of average and below-average intelligence. The book was controversial, especially where the authors wrote about [[Race and intelligence|racial differences in intelligence]] and discussed the implications of those differences.\n\nShortly after its publication, many people rallied both in criticism and defense of the book. A number of critical texts were written in response to it.\n\n==Synopsis==\n{{One source|section|date=December 2019}} \n\n''The Bell Curve'', published in 1994, was written by Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray to explain the variations in intelligence in American society, warn of some consequences of that variation, and propose social policies for mitigating the worst of the consequences. The book's title comes from the bell-shaped [[normal distribution]] of [[intelligence quotient]] (IQ) scores in a population.\n\n===Introduction===\n\nThe book starts with an introduction that appraises the history of the concept of intelligence from [[Francis Galton]] to modern times. Spearman's introduction of the [[g factor (psychometrics)|general factor of intelligence]] and other early advances in research on intelligence are discussed along with a consideration of links between intelligence testing and racial politics. The 1960s are identified as the period in American history when social problems were increasingly attributed to forces outside the individual. This egalitarian ethos, Herrnstein and Murray argue, cannot accommodate biologically based individual differences.<ref name=\"devlin\">{{cite book| title= Intelligence, Genes, and Success: Scientists Respond to The Bell Curve| url= https://archive.org/details/intelligencegene00bern| url-access= registration| first1= Bernie| last1= Devlin | first2= Stephen E. | last2= Fienberg| first3=  Daniel P. | last3= Resnick| first4= Kathryn | last4= Roeder|author4-link= Kathryn Roeder |  publisher= Springer Science & Business Media| year= 1997 | isbn= 978-0387949864}}</ref>\n\nThe introduction states six of the authors' assumptions, which they claim to be \"beyond significant technical dispute\":<ref name=\"HerrnsteinMurray2010\">{{cite book|first1= Richard J. |last1= Herrnstein| first2= Charles |last2= Murray| title= Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s4CKqxi6yWIC|date=11 May 2010 |publisher=Simon and Schuster| isbn= 978-1-4391-3491-7| pages= 22\u201323}}</ref>\n# There is such a difference as a general factor of cognitive ability on which human beings differ.\n# All standardized tests of academic aptitude or achievement measure this general factor to some degree, but IQ tests expressly designed for that purpose measure it most accurately.\n# IQ scores match, to a first degree, whatever it is that people mean when they use the word intelligent, or smart in ordinary language.\n# IQ scores are stable, although not perfectly so, over much of a person's life.\n# Properly administered IQ tests are not demonstrably biased against social, economic, ethnic, or racial groups.\n# Cognitive ability is substantially [[Heritability|heritable]], apparently no less than 40 percent and no more than 80 percent.\nAt the close of the introduction, the authors warn the reader against committing the [[ecological fallacy]] of inferring things about individuals based on the aggregate data presented in the book. They also assert that intelligence is just one of many valuable human attributes and one whose importance among human virtues is overrated.<ref name=\"devlin\"/>\n\n===Part I. The Emergence of a Cognitive Elite===\n\nIn the first part of the book Herrnstein and Murray chart how American society was transformed in the 20th century. They argue that America evolved from a society where social origin largely determined one's social status to one where cognitive ability is the leading determinant of status. The growth in college attendance, a more efficient recruitment of cognitive ability, and the sorting of cognitive ability by selective colleges are identified as important drivers of this evolution. Increased occupational sorting by cognitive ability is discussed. The argument is made, based on published meta-analyses, that cognitive ability is the best predictor of worker productivity.<ref name=\"devlin\"/>\n\nHerrnstein and Murray argue that due to increasing returns to cognitive ability, a cognitive elite is being formed in America. This elite is getting richer and progressively more segregated from the rest of society.<ref name=\"devlin\"/>\n\n===Part II. Cognitive Classes and Social Behavior===\n\nThe second part describes how cognitive ability is related to social behaviors: high ability predicts socially desirable behavior, low ability undesirable behavior. The argument is made that group differences in social outcomes are better explained by intelligence differences rather than socioeconomic status, a perspective, the authors argue, that has been neglected in research.<ref name=\"devlin\"/>\n\nThe analyses reported in this part of the book were done using data from the [[National Longitudinal Surveys|National Longitudinal Survey of Labor Market Experience of Youth]] (NLSY), a study conducted by the [[United States Department of Labor]]'s [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] tracking thousands of Americans starting in the 1980s. Only [[non-Hispanic white]]s are included in the analyses so as to demonstrate that the relationships between cognitive ability and social behavior are not driven by race or ethnicity.<ref name=\"devlin\"/>\n\nHerrnstein and Murray argue that intelligence is a better predictor of individuals' outcomes than parental socioeconomic status. This argument is based on analyses where individuals' IQ scores are shown to better predict their outcomes as adults than the socioeconomic status of their parents. Such results are reported for many outcomes, including poverty, dropping out of school, unemployment, marriage, divorce, illegitimacy, welfare dependency, criminal offending, and the probability of voting in elections.<ref name=\"devlin\"/>\n\nAll participants in the NLSY took the [[Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery]] (ASVAB), a battery of ten tests taken by all who apply for entry into the armed services. (Some had taken an IQ test in high school, and the median correlation of the [[Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery#Armed Forces Qualification Test|Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT)]] scores and those IQ test scores was .81). Participants were later evaluated for social and economic outcomes. In general, IQ/AFQT scores were a better predictor of life outcomes than [[social class]] background. Similarly, after statistically controlling for differences in IQ, many outcome differences between racial-ethnic groups disappeared.{{fact|date=December 2019}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Economic and social correlates of IQ\n!

The National Context===\n\nThis part of the book discusses ethnic differences in cognitive ability and social behavior. Herrnstein and Murray report that Asian Americans have a higher mean IQ than white Americans, who in turn outscore black Americans. The book argues that the black-white gap is not due to test bias, noting that IQ tests do not tend to underpredict the school or job performance of black individuals and that the gap is larger on apparently culturally neutral test items than on more culturally loaded items. The authors also note that adjusting for socioeconomic status does not eliminate the black-white IQ gap. However, they argue that the gap is narrowing.<ref name=\"devlin\"/>\n\nAccording to Herrnstein and Murray, the high [[heritability of IQ]] within races does not necessarily mean that the cause of differences between races is genetic. On the other hand, they discuss lines of evidence that have been used to support the thesis that the black-white gap is at least partly genetic, such as [[Spearman's hypothesis]]. They also discuss possible environmental explanations of the gap, such as the observed generational increases in IQ, for which they coin the term [[Flynn effect]]. At the close of this discussion, they write:<ref name=\"devlin\"/>\n\n{{quote|\"If the reader is now convinced that either the genetic or environmental explanation has won out to the exclusion of the other, we have not done a sufficiently good job of presenting one side or the other. It seems highly likely to us that both genes and environment have something to do with racial differences. What might the mix be? We are resolutely agnostic on that issue; as far as we can determine, the evidence does not yet justify an estimate.\"}}\n\nThe authors also stress that regardless of the causes of differences, people should be treated no differently.<ref name=\"devlin\"/>\n\nIn Part III, the authors also repeat many of the analyses from Part II, but now compare whites to blacks and Hispanics in the NLSY dataset. They find that after controlling for IQ, many differences in social outcomes between races are diminished.<ref name=\"devlin\"/>\n\nThe authors discuss the possibility that high birth rates among those with lower IQs may exert a downward pressure on the national distribution of cognitive ability. They argue that immigration may also have a similar effect.<ref name=\"devlin\"/>\n\nAt the close of Part III, Herrnstein and Murray discuss the relation of IQ to social problems. Using the NLSY data, they show that social problems increase as a monotonic function of lower IQ.<ref name=\"devlin\"/>\n\n===Living Together===\n\nIn this final chapter, the authors discuss the relevance of cognitive ability for understanding major social issues in America.<ref name=\"devlin\"/>\n\nEvidence for experimental attempts to raise intelligence is reviewed. The authors conclude that currently there are no means to boost intelligence by more than a modest degree.<ref name=\"devlin\"/>\n\nThe authors criticize the \"levelling\" of general and secondary education and defend [[gifted education]]. They offer a critical overview of [[affirmative action]] policies in colleges and workplaces, arguing that their goal should be equality of opportunity rather than equal outcomes.<ref name=\"devlin\"/>\n\nHerrnstein and Murray offer a pessimistic portrait of America's future. They predict that a cognitive elite will further isolate itself from the rest of society, while the quality of life deteriorates for those at the bottom of the cognitive scale. As an antidote to this prognosis, they offer a vision of society where differences in ability are recognized and everybody can have a valued place, stressing the role of local communities and clear moral rules that apply to everybody.<ref name=\"devlin\"/>\n\n==Policy recommendations==\n{{Primary sources|section|date=December 2019}}\nHerrnstein and Murray argued the average genetic IQ of the United States is declining, owing to the tendency of the more intelligent having fewer children than the less intelligent, the generation length to be shorter for the less intelligent, and the large-scale immigration to the United States of those with low intelligence. Discussing a possible future political outcome of an intellectually stratified society, the authors stated that they \"fear that a new kind of conservatism is becoming the dominant ideology of the affluent\u2014not in the social tradition of an Edmund Burke or in the economic tradition of an Adam Smith but 'conservatism' along Latin American lines, where to be conservative has often meant doing whatever is necessary to preserve the mansions on the hills from the menace of the slums below.\"<ref>p.&nbsp;518.</ref> Moreover, they fear that increasing welfare will create a \"custodial state\" in \"a high-tech and more lavish version of the Indian reservation for some substantial minority of the nation's population.\" They also predict increasing [[totalitarianism]]: \"It is difficult to imagine the United States preserving its heritage of individualism, equal rights before the law, free people running their own lives, once it is accepted that a significant part of the population must be made permanent wards of the states.\"<ref>p.&nbsp;526.</ref>\n\nThe authors recommended the elimination of welfare policies that encourage poor women to have babies:\n\n{{quote|We can imagine no recommendation for using the government to manipulate fertility that does not have dangers. But this highlights the problem: The United States already has policies that inadvertently social-engineer who has babies, and it is encouraging the wrong women. \"If the United States did as much to encourage high-IQ women to have babies as it now does to encourage low-IQ women, it would rightly be described as engaging in aggressive manipulation of fertility.\" The technically precise description of America's fertility policy is that it subsidizes births among poor women, who are also disproportionately at the low end of the intelligence distribution. We urge generally that these policies, represented by the extensive network of cash and services for low-income women who have babies, be ended. The government should stop subsidizing births to anyone rich or poor. The other generic recommendation, as close to harmless as any government program we can imagine, is to make it easy for women to make good on their prior decision not to get pregnant by making available birth control mechanisms that are increasingly flexible, foolproof, inexpensive, and safe.<ref>pp. 548\u2013549.</ref>}}\n\n==Media reception==\n''The Bell Curve'' received a great deal of media attention.

They found that if IQ scores are adjusted, as Herrnstein and Murray did, to eliminate the effect of [[education]], the ability of IQ to predict [[poverty]] can become dramatically larger, by as much as 61 percent for whites and 74 percent for blacks. According to the authors, Herrnstein and Murray's finding that IQ predicts poverty much better than socioeconomic status is substantially a result of the way they handled the statistics.<ref>''[http://press.princeton.edu/titles/5877.html Inequality by Design: Cracking the Bell Curve Myth]'' Claude S.

Korenman and Winship concluded: \"...{{nbsp}}there is evidence of substantial bias due to measurement error in their estimates of the effects of parents' socioeconomic status. In addition, Herrnstein and Murray's measure of parental socioeconomic status (SES) fails to capture the effects of important elements of family background (such as single-parent family structure at age 14). As a result, their analysis gives an exaggerated impression of the importance of IQ relative to parents' SES, and relative to family background more generally. Estimates based on a variety of methods, including analyses of siblings, suggest that parental family background is at least as important, and may be more important than IQ in determining socioeconomic success in adulthood.\"<ref>http://ssrn.com/abstract=225294 Korenman, Sanders and Winship, Christopher, \"A Reanalysis of The Bell Curve\" (August 1995).

He continues:\n\n{{quote|Ironically, the authors delete from their composite AFQT score a timed test of numerical operations because it is not highly correlated with the other tests. Yet it is well known that in the data they use, this subtest is the single best predictor of earnings of all the AFQT test components. The fact that many of the subtests are only weakly correlated with each other, and that the best predictor of earnings is only weakly correlated with their \"g-loaded\" score, only heightens doubts that a single-ability model is a satisfactory description of human intelligence. It also drives home the point that the \"g-loading\" so strongly emphasized by Murray and Herrnstein measures only agreement among tests\u2014not predictive power for socioeconomic outcomes.

Tittle and Thomas Rotolo found that the more the written, IQ-like, examinations are used as screening devices for occupational access, the stronger the relationship between IQ and income.

One chart in ''The Bell Curve'' purports to show that people with IQs above 120 have become \"rapidly more concentrated\" in high-IQ occupations since 1940. But Robert Hauser and his colleague Min-Hsiung Huang retested the data and came up with estimates that fell \"well below those of Herrnstein and Murray.\" They add that the data, properly used, \"do not tell us anything except that selected, highly educated occupation groups have grown rapidly since 1940.\"<ref>''[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ap/so/1997/00000026/00000003/art00604 Verbal Ability and Socioeconomic Success: A Trend Analysis]'' Hauser R.M.; Huang M.H.</ref>\n\nIn 1972, [[Noam Chomsky]] questioned Herrnstein's idea that society was developing towards a [[meritocracy]]. Chomsky criticized the assumptions that people only seek occupations based on material gain. He argued that Herrnstein would not want to become a baker or lumberjack even if he could earn more money that way.

The authors were reported throughout the popular press as arguing that these IQ differences are strictly genetic, when in fact they attributed IQ differences to both genes and the environment in chapter 13: \"It seems highly likely to us that both genes and the environment have something to do with racial differences.\" The introduction to the chapter more cautiously states, \"The debate about whether and how much genes and environment have to do with ethnic differences remains unresolved.\"\n\nWhen several prominent critics turned this into an \"assumption\" that the authors had attributed most or all of the racial differences in IQ to genes, co-author Charles Murray responded by quoting two passages from the book:\n* If the reader is now convinced that either the genetic or environmental explanation has won out to the exclusion of the other, we have not done a sufficiently good job of presenting one side or the other. It seems highly likely to us that both genes and the environment have something to do with racial differences. What might the mix be? We are resolutely agnostic on that issue; as far as we can determine, the evidence does not justify an estimate.

In light of the interpretation of proof as justification of truth, the conclusion is often viewed as a [[Necessity and sufficiency|necessary consequence]] of the hypotheses. Namely, that the conclusion is true in case the hypotheses are true\u2014without any further assumptions. However, the conditional could also be interpreted differently in certain [[deductive system]]s, depending on the meanings assigned to the derivation rules and the conditional symbol (e.g., [[non-classical logic]]).\n\nAlthough theorems can be written in a completely symbolic form (e.g., as propositions in [[propositional calculus]]), they are often expressed informally in a natural language such as English for better readability. The same is true of proofs, which are often expressed as logically organized and clearly worded informal arguments, intended to convince readers of the truth of the statement of the theorem beyond any doubt, and from which a formal symbolic proof can in principle be constructed. \n\nIn addition to the better readability, informal arguments are typically easier to check than purely symbolic ones\u2014indeed, many mathematicians would express a preference for a proof that not only demonstrates the validity of a theorem, but also explains in some way ''why'' it is obviously true. In some cases, one might even be able to substantiate a theorem by using a picture as its proof.\n\nBecause theorems lie at the core of mathematics, they are also central to its [[Aesthetics of mathematics|aesthetics]]. Theorems are often described as being \"trivial\", or \"difficult\", or \"deep\", or even \"beautiful\". These subjective judgments vary not only from person to person, but also with time and culture: for example, as a proof is obtained, simplified or better understood, a theorem that was once difficult may become trivial.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Theorem.html|title=Theorem|last=Weisstein|first=Eric W.|website=mathworld.wolfram.com|language=en|access-date=2019-11-02}}</ref> On the other hand, a deep theorem may be stated simply, but its proof may involve surprising and subtle connections between disparate areas of mathematics. [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] is a particularly well-known example of such a theorem.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.math.mcgill.ca/darmon/pub/Articles/Expository/05.DDT/paper.pdf|title=Fermat's Last Theorem|last=Darmon|first=Henri|last2=Diamond|first2=Fred|date=2007-09-09|website=McGill University \u2014 Department of Mathematics and Statistics|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-11-01|last3=Taylor|first3=Richard}}</ref>\n\n== Informal account of theorems ==\n\n[[Logically]], many theorems are of the form of an [[indicative conditional]]: ''if A, then B''. Such a theorem does not assert ''B''\u2014only that ''B'' is a necessary consequence of ''A''. In this case, ''A'' is called the '''hypothesis''' of the theorem (\"hypothesis\" here means something very different from a [[conjecture]]), and ''B'' the '''conclusion''' of the theorem. Alternatively, ''A'' and ''B'' can be also termed the ''antecedent'' and the ''consequent'', respectively.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://intrologic.stanford.edu/glossary/implication.html|title=Implication|website=intrologic.stanford.edu|access-date=2019-11-02}}</ref> The theorem \"If ''n'' is an even [[natural number]], then ''n''/2 is a natural number\" is a typical example in which the hypothesis is \"''n'' is an even natural number\", and the conclusion is \"''n''/2 is also a natural number\".\n\nIn order for a theorem be proved, it must be in principle expressible as a precise, formal statement. However, theorems are usually expressed in natural language rather than in a completely symbolic form\u2014with the presumption that a formal statement can be derived from the informal one.\n\nIt is common in mathematics to choose a number of hypotheses within a given language and declare that the theory consists of all statements provable from these hypotheses. These hypotheses form the foundational basis of the theory and are called [[Axiom|axioms]] or postulates. The field of mathematics known as [[proof theory]] studies formal languages, axioms and the structure of proofs.\n\n[[File:4CT Non-Counterexample 1.svg|frame|right|A [[Plane (mathematics)|planar]] map with five colors such that no two regions with the same color meet. It can actually be colored in this way with only four colors. The [[four color theorem]] states that such colorings are possible for any planar map, but every known proof involves a computational search that is too long to check by hand.]]\nSome theorems are \"[[Triviality (mathematics)|trivial]]\", in the sense that they follow from definitions, axioms, and other theorems in obvious ways and do not contain any surprising insights.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mathvault.ca/math-glossary/#trivial|title=The Definitive Glossary of Higher Mathematical Jargon \u2014 Trivial|last=|first=|date=2019-08-01|website=Math Vault|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-11-02}}</ref> Some, on the other hand, may be called \"deep\", because their proofs may be long and difficult, involve areas of mathematics superficially distinct from the statement of the theorem itself, or show surprising connections between disparate areas of mathematics.<ref>{{MathWorld|title=Deep Theorem|urlname=DeepTheorem}}</ref> A theorem might be simple to state and yet be deep. An excellent example is [[Fermat's Last Theorem]],<ref name=\":1\" /> and there are many other examples of simple yet deep theorems in [[number theory]] and [[combinatorics]], among other areas.\n\nOther theorems have a known proof that cannot easily be written down. The most prominent examples are the four color theorem and the [[Kepler conjecture]]. Both of these theorems are only known to be true by reducing them to a computational search that is then verified by a computer program. Initially, many mathematicians did not accept this form of proof, but it has become more widely accepted. The mathematician [[Doron Zeilberger]] has even gone so far as to claim that these are possibly the only nontrivial results that mathematicians have ever proved.<ref>{{cite web|author=Doron Zeilberger|authorlink=Doron Zeilberger|title=Opinion 51|url=http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~zeilberg/Opinion51.html}}</ref> Many mathematical theorems can be reduced to more straightforward computation, including polynomial identities, trigonometric identities<ref>Such as the derivation of the formula for <math>\\tan (\\alpha + \\beta)</math> from the [[List of trigonometric identities#Angle sum and difference identities|addition formulas of sine and cosine]].</ref> and hypergeometric identities.<ref>Petkovsek et al. 1996.</ref>{{Page needed|date=October 2010}}\n\n==Provability and theoremhood==\n\nTo establish a mathematical statement as a theorem, a proof is required. That is, a valid line of reasoning from the axioms and other already-established theorems to the given statement must be demonstrated. In general, the proof is considered to be separate from the theorem statement itself. This is in part because while more than one proof may be known for a single theorem, only one proof is required to establish the status of a statement as a theorem. The [[Pythagorean theorem]] and the law of [[quadratic reciprocity]] are contenders for the title of theorem with the greatest number of distinct proofs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cut-the-knot.org/pythagoras/|title=Pythagorean Theorem and its many proofs|last=|first=|date=|website=www.cut-the-knot.org|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-11-02}}</ref><ref>See, for example, [[proofs of quadratic reciprocity]] for more.</ref>\n\n==Relation with scientific theories==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}\nTheorems in mathematics and theories in science are fundamentally different in their [[epistemology]]. A scientific theory cannot be proved; its key attribute is that it is [[falsifiable]], that is, it makes predictions about the natural world that are testable by [[experiment]]s. Any disagreement between prediction and experiment demonstrates the incorrectness of the scientific theory, or at least limits its accuracy or domain of validity. Mathematical theorems, on the other hand, are purely abstract formal statements: the proof of a theorem cannot involve experiments or other empirical evidence in the same way such evidence is used to support scientific theories.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[File:CollatzFractal.png|thumb|250px|right|The [[Collatz conjecture]]: one way to illustrate its complexity is to extend the iteration from the natural numbers to the complex numbers. The result is a [[fractal]], which (in accordance with [[universality (dynamical systems)|universality]]) resembles the [[Mandelbrot set]].]]\nNonetheless, there is some degree of empiricism and data collection involved in the discovery of mathematical theorems. By establishing a pattern, sometimes with the use of a powerful computer, mathematicians may have an idea of what to prove, and in some cases even a plan for how to set about doing the proof. For example, the [[Collatz conjecture]] has been verified for start values up to about 2.88&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;10<sup>18</sup>. The [[Riemann hypothesis]] has been verified for the first 10 trillion zeroes of the [[Riemann zeta function|zeta function]]. Neither of these statements is considered proved.\n\nSuch evidence does not constitute proof. For example, the [[Mertens conjecture]] is a statement about natural numbers that is now known to be false, but no explicit counterexample (i.e., a natural number ''n'' for which the Mertens function ''M''(''n'') equals or exceeds the square root of ''n'') is known: all numbers less than 10<sup>14</sup> have the Mertens property, and the smallest number that does not have this property is only known to be less than the [[exponential function|exponential]] of 1.59&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;10<sup>40</sup>, which is approximately 10 to the power 4.3&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;10<sup>39</sup>. Since the number of particles in the universe is generally considered less than 10 to the power 100 (a [[googol]]), there is no hope to find an explicit counterexample by [[exhaustive search]].\n\nThe word \"theory\" also exists in mathematics, to denote a body of mathematical axioms, definitions and theorems, as in, for example, [[group theory]] (see [[mathematical theory]]). There are also \"theorems\" in science, particularly physics, and in engineering, but they often have statements and proofs in which physical assumptions and intuition play an important role; the physical axioms on which such \"theorems\" are based are themselves falsifiable.\n\n==Terminology==\nA number of different terms for mathematical statements exist; these terms indicate the role statements play in a particular subject. The distinction between different terms is sometimes rather arbitrary and the usage of some terms has evolved over time.\n\n* An '''[[axiom]]''' or '''postulate''' is a statement that is accepted without proof and regarded as fundamental to a subject. Historically these have been regarded as \"self-evident\", but more recently they are considered assumptions that characterize the subject of study. In classical geometry, axioms are general statements, while postulates are statements about geometrical objects.<ref>{{cite book |title=Plane Geometry\n|url=https://archive.org/details/planegeometry00gwen\n|first1=G.|last1=Wentworth|first2=D.E.|last2=Smith|publisher=Ginn & Co.\n|year=1913|chapter=Art. 46, 47}}</ref> A [[definition]] is yet another form of statement that is also accepted without proof\u2014since it simply gives the meaning of a word or phrase in terms of known concepts.\n\n* An unproved statement that is believed true is called a '''[[conjecture]]''' (or sometimes a '''hypothesis''', but with a different meaning from the one discussed above). To be considered a conjecture, a statement must usually be proposed publicly, at which point the name of the proponent may be attached to the conjecture, as with [[Goldbach's conjecture]]. Other famous conjectures include the [[Collatz conjecture]] and the [[Riemann hypothesis]]. On the other hand, [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] has always been known by that name, even before it was proved; it was never known as \"Fermat's conjecture\".\n* A '''[[proposition]]''' is a theorem of lesser importance. This term sometimes connotes a statement with a simple proof, while the term '''theorem''' is usually reserved for the most important results or those with long or difficult proofs. Some authors never use \"proposition\", while some others use \"theorem\" only for fundamental results. In classical geometry, this term was used differently: In [[Euclid's Elements]] (c. 300 BCE), all theorems and geometric constructions were called \"propositions\" regardless of their importance.\n* A '''[[lemma (mathematics)|lemma]]''' is a \"helping theorem\", a proposition with little applicability except that it forms part of the proof of a larger theorem. In some cases, as the relative importance of different theorems becomes more clear, what was once considered a lemma is now considered a theorem, though the word \"lemma\" remains in the name. Examples include [[Gauss's lemma (polynomial)|Gauss's lemma]], [[Zorn's lemma]], and the [[Fundamental lemma (Langlands program)|fundamental lemma]].\n* A '''[[corollary]]''' is a proposition that follows with little proof from another theorem or definition.<ref>Wentworth & Smith Art. 51</ref> Also a corollary can be a theorem restated for a more restricted [[special case]]. For example, the theorem that all angles in a [[rectangle]] are [[right angle]]s has as corollary that all angles in a [[square]] (a [[special case]] of a rectangle) are [[right angle]]s.\n* {{anchor|Converse}}A '''[[Converse (logic)|converse]]''' of a theorem is a statement formed by interchanging what is given in a theorem and what is to be proved. For example, the [[isosceles triangle theorem]] states that if two sides of a triangle are equal then two angles are equal. In the converse, the given (that two sides are equal) and what is to be proved (that two angles are equal) are swapped, so the converse is the statement that if two angles of a triangle are equal then two sides are equal. In this example, the converse can be proved as another theorem, but this is often not the case. For example, the converse to the theorem that two right angles are equal angles is the statement that two equal angles must be right angles, and this is clearly not always the case.<ref>Follows Wentworth & Smith Art. 79</ref>\n* A '''[[generalization]]''' is a theorem which includes a previously proved theorem as a [[special case]] and hence as a corollary.\n\nThere are other terms, less commonly used, that are conventionally attached to proved statements, so that certain theorems are referred to by historical or customary names. For example:\n\n* An '''[[Identity (mathematics)|identity]]''' is an equality, contained in a theorem, between two mathematical expressions that holds regardless of the values being used for any [[variable (mathematics)|variables]] or [[parameter]]s appearing in the expressions (as long as they are within the range of validity).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mathvault.ca/math-glossary/#identity|title=The Definitive Glossary of Higher Mathematical Jargon \u2014 Identity|last=|first=|date=2019-08-01|website=Math Vault|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-11-02}}</ref> Examples include [[Euler's formula]] and [[Vandermonde's identity]].\n* A '''rule''' is a theorem, such as [[Bayes' rule]] and [[Cramer's rule]], that establishes a useful formula.\n* A '''[[Laws of science|law]]''' or a '''[[principle]]''' is a theorem that applies in a wide range of circumstances. Examples include the [[law of large numbers]], the [[law of cosines]], [[Kolmogorov's zero\u2013one law]], [[Harnack's principle]], the [[least-upper-bound principle]], and the [[pigeonhole principle]].<ref>The word ''law'' can also refer to an axiom, a [[rule of inference]], or, in [[probability theory]], a [[probability distribution]].</ref>\n\nA few well-known theorems have even more idiosyncratic names. The '''division algorithm''' (see [[Euclidean division]]) is a theorem expressing the outcome of division in the natural numbers and more general rings. '''[[B\u00e9zout's identity]]''' is a theorem asserting that the greatest common divisor of two numbers may be written as a linear combination of these numbers. The '''[[Banach\u2013Tarski paradox]]''' is a theorem in [[measure (mathematics)|measure theory]] that is [[paradox]]ical in the sense that it contradicts common intuitions about volume in three-dimensional space.\n\n==Layout==\n\nA theorem and its proof are typically laid out as follows:\n\n:'''Theorem''' (name of the person who proved it, along with year of discovery or publication of the proof).\n:''Statement of theorem (sometimes called the ''proposition'').''\n:'''Proof'''.\n:''Description of proof.''\n:''End''\n\nThe end of the proof may be signaled by the letters [[Q.E.D.]] (''quod erat demonstrandum'') or by one of the [[Tombstone (typography)|tombstone]] marks \"\u25a1\" or \"\u220e\" meaning \"End of Proof\", introduced by [[Paul Halmos]] following their usage in magazine articles.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://jeff560.tripod.com/set.html|title=Earliest Uses of Symbols of Set Theory and Logic|website=jeff560.tripod.com|access-date=2019-11-02}}</ref>\n\nThe exact style depends on the author or publication. Many publications provide instructions or [[Macro (computer science)|macros]] for typesetting in the [[Style guide|house style]].\n\nIt is common for a theorem to be preceded by [[definition]]s describing the exact meaning of the terms used in the theorem. It is also common for a theorem to be preceded by a number of propositions or lemmas which are then used in the proof. However, lemmas are sometimes embedded in the proof of a theorem, either with nested proofs, or with their proofs presented after the proof of the theorem.\n\nCorollaries to a theorem are either presented between the theorem and the proof, or directly after the proof. Sometimes, corollaries have proofs of their own that explain why they follow from the theorem.\n\n==Lore==\n\nIt has been estimated that over a quarter of a million theorems are proved every year.<ref>Hoffman 1998,  p. 204.</ref>\n\nThe well-known [[aphorism]], [[q:Paul Erd\u0151s|\"A mathematician is a device for turning coffee into theorems\"]], is probably due to [[Alfr\u00e9d R\u00e9nyi]], although it is often attributed to R\u00e9nyi's colleague [[Paul Erd\u0151s]] (and R\u00e9nyi may have been thinking of Erd\u0151s), who was famous for the many theorems he produced, the [[Erd\u0151s number|number]] of his collaborations, and his coffee drinking.<ref>Hoffman 1998, p. 7.</ref>\n\nThe [[classification of finite simple groups]] is regarded by some to be the longest proof of a theorem.

It is among the longest known proofs of a theorem whose statement can be easily understood by a layman.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Theorems in logic==\n{{More citations needed section|date=October 2010}}\n[[Logic]], especially in the field of [[proof theory]], considers theorems as statements (called '''[[formula]]s''' or '''[[well formed formula]]s''') of a formal language. The statements of the language are strings of symbols and  may be broadly divided into [[nonsense]] and well-formed formulas. A set of '''deduction rules''', also called '''transformation rules''' or [[rules of inference]], must be provided. These deduction rules tell exactly when a formula can be derived from a set of premises. The set of well-formed formulas may be broadly divided into theorems and non-theorems. However, according to [[Douglas Hofstadter|Hofstadter]], a formal system often simply defines all its well-formed formula as theorems.<ref>Hofstadter 1980</ref>{{Page needed|Also need to know the edition, and verify that in the references.  There are at least 4 English language editions of the book, in 1979, 1980, and two in 1999.|date=October 2010}}\n\nDifferent sets of derivation rules give rise to different interpretations of what it means for an expression to be a theorem. Some derivation rules and formal languages are intended to capture mathematical reasoning; the most common examples use [[first-order logic]]. Other deductive systems describe [[term rewriting]], such as the reduction rules for [[lambda calculus|\u03bb calculus]].\n\nThe definition of theorems as elements of a formal language allows for results in proof theory that study the structure of formal proofs and the structure of provable formulas. The most famous result is [[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems]]; by representing theorems about basic number theory as expressions in a formal language, and then representing this language within number theory itself, G\u00f6del constructed examples of statements that are neither provable nor disprovable from axiomatizations of number theory.\n{{Clear}}<!-- stop picture bleeding into completely unrelated next section -->\n\n[[File:Formal languages.svg|thumb|300px|right|This diagram shows the [[Syntax (logic)|syntactic entities]] that can be constructed from [[formal language]]s. The [[symbol (formal)|symbols]] and [[string (computer science)|strings of symbols]] may be broadly divided into [[nonsense]] and [[well-formed formula]]s. A formal language can be thought of as identical to the set of its well-formed formulas. The set of well-formed formulas may be broadly divided into theorems and non-theorems.]]\nA theorem may be expressed in a [[formal language]] (or \"formalized\"). A formal theorem is the purely formal analogue of a theorem. In general, a formal theorem is a type of [[well-formed formula]] that satisfies certain logical and syntactic conditions. The notation {{tee}} <math>S</math> is often used to indicate that <math>S</math> is a theorem.\n\nFormal theorems consist of [[Formula (mathematical logic)|formulas]] of a formal language and the [[transformation rule]]s of a formal system. Specifically, a formal theorem is always the last formula of a [[formal proof|derivation]] in some formal system, each formula of which is a [[logical consequence]] of the formulas that came before it in the derivation. The initially-accepted formulas in the derivation are called its '''axioms''', and are the basis on which the theorem is derived. A [[set (mathematics)|set]] of theorems is called a '''theory'''.\n\nWhat makes formal theorems useful and interesting is that they can be [[interpretation (logic)|interpreted]] as true [[proposition]]s and their derivations may be interpreted as a proof of the [[truth]] of the resulting expression. A set of formal theorems may be referred to as a '''[[theory (mathematical logic)|formal theory]]'''. A theorem whose interpretation is a true statement ''about'' a formal system (as opposed to ''of'' a formal system) is called a '''[[metatheorem]]'''.\n\n=== Syntax and semantics ===\n{{Main|Syntax (logic)|Formal semantics (logic)}}\n\nThe concept of a formal theorem is fundamentally syntactic, in contrast to the notion of a ''true proposition,'' which introduces [[semantics]]. Different deductive systems can yield other interpretations, depending on the presumptions of the derivation rules (i.e. [[belief]], [[Theory of justification|justification]] or other [[Modal logic|modalities]]). The [[soundness]] of a formal system depends on whether or not all of its theorems are also [[Validity (logic)|validities]]. A validity is a formula that is true under any possible interpretation (for example, in classical propositional logic, validities are [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]]). A formal system is considered [[completeness (logic)|semantically complete]] when all of its theorems are also tautologies.\n\n=== Derivation of a theorem ===\n\n{{refimprove|date=February 2020}}\n{{Main|Formal proof}}\n\nThe notion of a theorem is very closely connected to its formal proof (also called a \"derivation\"). As an illustration, consider a very simplified formal system <math>\\mathcal{FS}</math> whose alphabet consists of only two symbols { '''A''', '''B''' }, and whose formation rule for formulas is:\n:Any string of symbols of <math>\\mathcal{FS}</math> that is at least three symbols long, and is not infinitely long, is a formula. Nothing else is a formula.\n\nThe single axiom of <math>\\mathcal{FS}</math> is:\n:'''ABBA'''.\n\nThe only [[rule of inference]] (transformation rule) for <math>\\mathcal{FS}</math> is:\n:Any occurrence of \"'''A'''\" in a theorem may be replaced by an occurrence of the string \"'''AB'''\" and the result is a theorem.\n\nTheorems in <math>\\mathcal{FS}</math> are defined as those formulas that have a derivation ending with it. For example,\n\n#'''ABBA''' (Given as axiom)\n#'''ABBBA''' (by applying the transformation rule)\n#'''ABBBAB''' (by applying the transformation rule)\n\nis a derivation. Therefore, \"'''ABBBAB'''\" is a theorem of <math>\\mathcal{FS} \\,.</math> The notion of truth (or falsity) cannot be applied to the formula \"'''ABBBAB'''\" until an interpretation is given to its symbols. Thus in this example, the formula does not yet represent a proposition, but is merely an empty abstraction.\n\nTwo metatheorems of <math>\\mathcal{FS}</math> are:\n:Every theorem begins with \"'''A'''\".\n:Every theorem has exactly two \"'''A'''\"s.\n\n=== Interpretation of a formal theorem ===\n{{Main|Interpretation (logic)}}<!-- Wouldn't this fit better in the page \"formal theorem\"? -->\n\n=== Theorems and theories ===\n{{Main|Theory|Theory (mathematical logic)}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Philosophy|Mathematics}}\n* [[List of theorems]]\n*[[Fundamental theorem]]\n*[[Formula]]\n*[[Inference]]\n* [[Toy theorem]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|40em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{Cite book|authorlink=Archimedes|title=The works of Archimedes|last=Heath|first=Sir Thomas Little|publisher=Dover|year=1897|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FIY5AAAAMAAJ&dq=works+of+archimedes&printsec=frontcover&source=bl&ots=PRfqkNAFl-&sig=vRhyLwEr-wNV-bGsOB9eKas-63E&hl=en&ei=Smn_SuL6FZPElAfmj7SSCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CBAQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=theorem&f=false|accessdate=2009-11-15}}\n* {{Cite book|title = [[The Man Who Loved Only Numbers]]: The Story of Paul Erd\u0151s and the Search for Mathematical Truth|author = Hoffman, P.|publisher = Hyperion, New York| year = 1998|isbn=1-85702-829-5}}\n* {{Cite book\n | last = Hofstadter\n | first = Douglas\n | authorlink = Douglas Hofstadter\n | title = [[G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach]]: An Eternal Golden Braid\n | publisher = Basic Books\n | year = 1979\n}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Hunter|first=Geoffrey|authorlink=Geoffrey Hunter (logician)|title=Metalogic: An Introduction to the Metatheory of Standard First Order Logic |year=1996|origyear=1973|publisher=University of California Press |isbn=0-520-02356-0}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Mates|first=Benson|authorlink=Benson Mates|title=Elementary Logic|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1972|isbn=0-19-501491-X|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/elementarylogic00mate}}\n* {{Cite book|title=A = B|url=http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~wilf/AeqB.html|author1=Petkovsek, Marko|author2=Wilf, Herbert|author3=Zeilberger, Doron|publisher=A.K.

The same is true of proofs, which are often expressed as logically organized and clearly worded informal arguments, intended to convince readers of the truth of the statement of the theorem beyond any doubt, and from which a formal symbolic proof can in principle be constructed. \n\nIn addition to the better readability, informal arguments are typically easier to check than purely symbolic ones\u2014indeed, many mathematicians would express a preference for a proof that not only demonstrates the validity of a theorem, but also explains in some way ''why'' it is obviously true. In some cases, one might even be able to substantiate a theorem by using a picture as its proof.\n\nBecause theorems lie at the core of mathematics, they are also central to its [[Aesthetics of mathematics|aesthetics]]. Theorems are often described as being \"trivial\", or \"difficult\", or \"deep\", or even \"beautiful\". These subjective judgments vary not only from person to person, but also with time and culture: for example, as a proof is obtained, simplified or better understood, a theorem that was once difficult may become trivial.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Theorem.html|title=Theorem|last=Weisstein|first=Eric W.|website=mathworld.wolfram.com|language=en|access-date=2019-11-02}}</ref> On the other hand, a deep theorem may be stated simply, but its proof may involve surprising and subtle connections between disparate areas of mathematics. [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] is a particularly well-known example of such a theorem.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.math.mcgill.ca/darmon/pub/Articles/Expository/05.DDT/paper.pdf|title=Fermat's Last Theorem|last=Darmon|first=Henri|last2=Diamond|first2=Fred|date=2007-09-09|website=McGill University \u2014 Department of Mathematics and Statistics|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-11-01|last3=Taylor|first3=Richard}}</ref>\n\n== Informal account of theorems ==\n\n[[Logically]], many theorems are of the form of an [[indicative conditional]]: ''if A, then B''. Such a theorem does not assert ''B''\u2014only that ''B'' is a necessary consequence of ''A''. In this case, ''A'' is called the '''hypothesis''' of the theorem (\"hypothesis\" here means something very different from a [[conjecture]]), and ''B'' the '''conclusion''' of the theorem. Alternatively, ''A'' and ''B'' can be also termed the ''antecedent'' and the ''consequent'', respectively.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://intrologic.stanford.edu/glossary/implication.html|title=Implication|website=intrologic.stanford.edu|access-date=2019-11-02}}</ref> The theorem \"If ''n'' is an even [[natural number]], then ''n''/2 is a natural number\" is a typical example in which the hypothesis is \"''n'' is an even natural number\", and the conclusion is \"''n''/2 is also a natural number\".\n\nIn order for a theorem be proved, it must be in principle expressible as a precise, formal statement. However, theorems are usually expressed in natural language rather than in a completely symbolic form\u2014with the presumption that a formal statement can be derived from the informal one.\n\nIt is common in mathematics to choose a number of hypotheses within a given language and declare that the theory consists of all statements provable from these hypotheses. These hypotheses form the foundational basis of the theory and are called [[Axiom|axioms]] or postulates. The field of mathematics known as [[proof theory]] studies formal languages, axioms and the structure of proofs.\n\n[[File:4CT Non-Counterexample 1.svg|frame|right|A [[Plane (mathematics)|planar]] map with five colors such that no two regions with the same color meet. It can actually be colored in this way with only four colors. The [[four color theorem]] states that such colorings are possible for any planar map, but every known proof involves a computational search that is too long to check by hand.]]\nSome theorems are \"[[Triviality (mathematics)|trivial]]\", in the sense that they follow from definitions, axioms, and other theorems in obvious ways and do not contain any surprising insights.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mathvault.ca/math-glossary/#trivial|title=The Definitive Glossary of Higher Mathematical Jargon \u2014 Trivial|last=|first=|date=2019-08-01|website=Math Vault|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-11-02}}</ref> Some, on the other hand, may be called \"deep\", because their proofs may be long and difficult, involve areas of mathematics superficially distinct from the statement of the theorem itself, or show surprising connections between disparate areas of mathematics.<ref>{{MathWorld|title=Deep Theorem|urlname=DeepTheorem}}</ref> A theorem might be simple to state and yet be deep. An excellent example is [[Fermat's Last Theorem]],<ref name=\":1\" /> and there are many other examples of simple yet deep theorems in [[number theory]] and [[combinatorics]], among other areas.\n\nOther theorems have a known proof that cannot easily be written down. The most prominent examples are the four color theorem and the [[Kepler conjecture]]. Both of these theorems are only known to be true by reducing them to a computational search that is then verified by a computer program. Initially, many mathematicians did not accept this form of proof, but it has become more widely accepted. The mathematician [[Doron Zeilberger]] has even gone so far as to claim that these are possibly the only nontrivial results that mathematicians have ever proved.<ref>{{cite web|author=Doron Zeilberger|authorlink=Doron Zeilberger|title=Opinion 51|url=http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~zeilberg/Opinion51.html}}</ref> Many mathematical theorems can be reduced to more straightforward computation, including polynomial identities, trigonometric identities<ref>Such as the derivation of the formula for <math>\\tan (\\alpha + \\beta)</math> from the [[List of trigonometric identities#Angle sum and difference identities|addition formulas of sine and cosine]].</ref> and hypergeometric identities.<ref>Petkovsek et al. 1996.</ref>{{Page needed|date=October 2010}}\n\n==Provability and theoremhood==\n\nTo establish a mathematical statement as a theorem, a proof is required. That is, a valid line of reasoning from the axioms and other already-established theorems to the given statement must be demonstrated. In general, the proof is considered to be separate from the theorem statement itself. This is in part because while more than one proof may be known for a single theorem, only one proof is required to establish the status of a statement as a theorem. The [[Pythagorean theorem]] and the law of [[quadratic reciprocity]] are contenders for the title of theorem with the greatest number of distinct proofs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cut-the-knot.org/pythagoras/|title=Pythagorean Theorem and its many proofs|last=|first=|date=|website=www.cut-the-knot.org|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-11-02}}</ref><ref>See, for example, [[proofs of quadratic reciprocity]] for more.</ref>\n\n==Relation with scientific theories==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}\nTheorems in mathematics and theories in science are fundamentally different in their [[epistemology]]. A scientific theory cannot be proved; its key attribute is that it is [[falsifiable]], that is, it makes predictions about the natural world that are testable by [[experiment]]s. Any disagreement between prediction and experiment demonstrates the incorrectness of the scientific theory, or at least limits its accuracy or domain of validity. Mathematical theorems, on the other hand, are purely abstract formal statements: the proof of a theorem cannot involve experiments or other empirical evidence in the same way such evidence is used to support scientific theories.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[File:CollatzFractal.png|thumb|250px|right|The [[Collatz conjecture]]: one way to illustrate its complexity is to extend the iteration from the natural numbers to the complex numbers. The result is a [[fractal]], which (in accordance with [[universality (dynamical systems)|universality]]) resembles the [[Mandelbrot set]].]]\nNonetheless, there is some degree of empiricism and data collection involved in the discovery of mathematical theorems. By establishing a pattern, sometimes with the use of a powerful computer, mathematicians may have an idea of what to prove, and in some cases even a plan for how to set about doing the proof. For example, the [[Collatz conjecture]] has been verified for start values up to about 2.88&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;10<sup>18</sup>. The [[Riemann hypothesis]] has been verified for the first 10 trillion zeroes of the [[Riemann zeta function|zeta function]]. Neither of these statements is considered proved.\n\nSuch evidence does not constitute proof. For example, the [[Mertens conjecture]] is a statement about natural numbers that is now known to be false, but no explicit counterexample (i.e., a natural number ''n'' for which the Mertens function ''M''(''n'') equals or exceeds the square root of ''n'') is known: all numbers less than 10<sup>14</sup> have the Mertens property, and the smallest number that does not have this property is only known to be less than the [[exponential function|exponential]] of 1.59&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;10<sup>40</sup>, which is approximately 10 to the power 4.3&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;10<sup>39</sup>. Since the number of particles in the universe is generally considered less than 10 to the power 100 (a [[googol]]), there is no hope to find an explicit counterexample by [[exhaustive search]].\n\nThe word \"theory\" also exists in mathematics, to denote a body of mathematical axioms, definitions and theorems, as in, for example, [[group theory]] (see [[mathematical theory]]). There are also \"theorems\" in science, particularly physics, and in engineering, but they often have statements and proofs in which physical assumptions and intuition play an important role; the physical axioms on which such \"theorems\" are based are themselves falsifiable.\n\n==Terminology==\nA number of different terms for mathematical statements exist; these terms indicate the role statements play in a particular subject. The distinction between different terms is sometimes rather arbitrary and the usage of some terms has evolved over time.\n\n* An '''[[axiom]]''' or '''postulate''' is a statement that is accepted without proof and regarded as fundamental to a subject. Historically these have been regarded as \"self-evident\", but more recently they are considered assumptions that characterize the subject of study. In classical geometry, axioms are general statements, while postulates are statements about geometrical objects.<ref>{{cite book |title=Plane Geometry\n|url=https://archive.org/details/planegeometry00gwen\n|first1=G.|last1=Wentworth|first2=D.E.|last2=Smith|publisher=Ginn & Co.\n|year=1913|chapter=Art. 46, 47}}</ref> A [[definition]] is yet another form of statement that is also accepted without proof\u2014since it simply gives the meaning of a word or phrase in terms of known concepts.\n\n* An unproved statement that is believed true is called a '''[[conjecture]]''' (or sometimes a '''hypothesis''', but with a different meaning from the one discussed above). To be considered a conjecture, a statement must usually be proposed publicly, at which point the name of the proponent may be attached to the conjecture, as with [[Goldbach's conjecture]]. Other famous conjectures include the [[Collatz conjecture]] and the [[Riemann hypothesis]]. On the other hand, [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] has always been known by that name, even before it was proved; it was never known as \"Fermat's conjecture\".\n* A '''[[proposition]]''' is a theorem of lesser importance. This term sometimes connotes a statement with a simple proof, while the term '''theorem''' is usually reserved for the most important results or those with long or difficult proofs. Some authors never use \"proposition\", while some others use \"theorem\" only for fundamental results. In classical geometry, this term was used differently: In [[Euclid's Elements]] (c. 300 BCE), all theorems and geometric constructions were called \"propositions\" regardless of their importance.\n* A '''[[lemma (mathematics)|lemma]]''' is a \"helping theorem\", a proposition with little applicability except that it forms part of the proof of a larger theorem. In some cases, as the relative importance of different theorems becomes more clear, what was once considered a lemma is now considered a theorem, though the word \"lemma\" remains in the name. Examples include [[Gauss's lemma (polynomial)|Gauss's lemma]], [[Zorn's lemma]], and the [[Fundamental lemma (Langlands program)|fundamental lemma]].\n* A '''[[corollary]]''' is a proposition that follows with little proof from another theorem or definition.<ref>Wentworth & Smith Art. 51</ref> Also a corollary can be a theorem restated for a more restricted [[special case]]. For example, the theorem that all angles in a [[rectangle]] are [[right angle]]s has as corollary that all angles in a [[square]] (a [[special case]] of a rectangle) are [[right angle]]s.\n* {{anchor|Converse}}A '''[[Converse (logic)|converse]]''' of a theorem is a statement formed by interchanging what is given in a theorem and what is to be proved. For example, the [[isosceles triangle theorem]] states that if two sides of a triangle are equal then two angles are equal. In the converse, the given (that two sides are equal) and what is to be proved (that two angles are equal) are swapped, so the converse is the statement that if two angles of a triangle are equal then two sides are equal. In this example, the converse can be proved as another theorem, but this is often not the case. For example, the converse to the theorem that two right angles are equal angles is the statement that two equal angles must be right angles, and this is clearly not always the case.<ref>Follows Wentworth & Smith Art. 79</ref>\n* A '''[[generalization]]''' is a theorem which includes a previously proved theorem as a [[special case]] and hence as a corollary.\n\nThere are other terms, less commonly used, that are conventionally attached to proved statements, so that certain theorems are referred to by historical or customary names. For example:\n\n* An '''[[Identity (mathematics)|identity]]''' is an equality, contained in a theorem, between two mathematical expressions that holds regardless of the values being used for any [[variable (mathematics)|variables]] or [[parameter]]s appearing in the expressions (as long as they are within the range of validity).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mathvault.ca/math-glossary/#identity|title=The Definitive Glossary of Higher Mathematical Jargon \u2014 Identity|last=|first=|date=2019-08-01|website=Math Vault|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-11-02}}</ref> Examples include [[Euler's formula]] and [[Vandermonde's identity]].\n* A '''rule''' is a theorem, such as [[Bayes' rule]] and [[Cramer's rule]], that establishes a useful formula.\n* A '''[[Laws of science|law]]''' or a '''[[principle]]''' is a theorem that applies in a wide range of circumstances. Examples include the [[law of large numbers]], the [[law of cosines]], [[Kolmogorov's zero\u2013one law]], [[Harnack's principle]], the [[least-upper-bound principle]], and the [[pigeonhole principle]].<ref>The word ''law'' can also refer to an axiom, a [[rule of inference]], or, in [[probability theory]], a [[probability distribution]].</ref>\n\nA few well-known theorems have even more idiosyncratic names. The '''division algorithm''' (see [[Euclidean division]]) is a theorem expressing the outcome of division in the natural numbers and more general rings. '''[[B\u00e9zout's identity]]''' is a theorem asserting that the greatest common divisor of two numbers may be written as a linear combination of these numbers. The '''[[Banach\u2013Tarski paradox]]''' is a theorem in [[measure (mathematics)|measure theory]] that is [[paradox]]ical in the sense that it contradicts common intuitions about volume in three-dimensional space.\n\n==Layout==\n\nA theorem and its proof are typically laid out as follows:\n\n:'''Theorem''' (name of the person who proved it, along with year of discovery or publication of the proof).\n:''Statement of theorem (sometimes called the ''proposition'').''\n:'''Proof'''.\n:''Description of proof.''\n:''End''\n\nThe end of the proof may be signaled by the letters [[Q.E.D.]] (''quod erat demonstrandum'') or by one of the [[Tombstone (typography)|tombstone]] marks \"\u25a1\" or \"\u220e\" meaning \"End of Proof\", introduced by [[Paul Halmos]] following their usage in magazine articles.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://jeff560.tripod.com/set.html|title=Earliest Uses of Symbols of Set Theory and Logic|website=jeff560.tripod.com|access-date=2019-11-02}}</ref>\n\nThe exact style depends on the author or publication. Many publications provide instructions or [[Macro (computer science)|macros]] for typesetting in the [[Style guide|house style]].\n\nIt is common for a theorem to be preceded by [[definition]]s describing the exact meaning of the terms used in the theorem. It is also common for a theorem to be preceded by a number of propositions or lemmas which are then used in the proof. However, lemmas are sometimes embedded in the proof of a theorem, either with nested proofs, or with their proofs presented after the proof of the theorem.\n\nCorollaries to a theorem are either presented between the theorem and the proof, or directly after the proof. Sometimes, corollaries have proofs of their own that explain why they follow from the theorem.\n\n==Lore==\n\nIt has been estimated that over a quarter of a million theorems are proved every year.<ref>Hoffman 1998,  p. 204.</ref>\n\nThe well-known [[aphorism]], [[q:Paul Erd\u0151s|\"A mathematician is a device for turning coffee into theorems\"]], is probably due to [[Alfr\u00e9d R\u00e9nyi]], although it is often attributed to R\u00e9nyi's colleague [[Paul Erd\u0151s]] (and R\u00e9nyi may have been thinking of Erd\u0151s), who was famous for the many theorems he produced, the [[Erd\u0151s number|number]] of his collaborations, and his coffee drinking.<ref>Hoffman 1998, p. 7.</ref>\n\nThe [[classification of finite simple groups]] is regarded by some to be the longest proof of a theorem. It comprises tens of thousands of pages in 500 journal articles by some 100 authors. These papers are together believed to give a complete proof, and several ongoing projects hope to shorten and simplify this proof.<ref>[http://plus.maths.org/issue41/features/elwes/index.html An enormous theorem: the classification of finite simple groups], Richard Elwes, Plus Magazine, Issue 41 December 2006.</ref> Another theorem of this type is the [[four color theorem]] whose computer generated proof is too long for a human to read. It is among the longest known proofs of a theorem whose statement can be easily understood by a layman.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Theorems in logic==\n{{More citations needed section|date=October 2010}}\n[[Logic]], especially in the field of [[proof theory]], considers theorems as statements (called '''[[formula]]s''' or '''[[well formed formula]]s''') of a formal language. The statements of the language are strings of symbols and  may be broadly divided into [[nonsense]] and well-formed formulas. A set of '''deduction rules''', also called '''transformation rules''' or [[rules of inference]], must be provided. These deduction rules tell exactly when a formula can be derived from a set of premises. The set of well-formed formulas may be broadly divided into theorems and non-theorems. However, according to [[Douglas Hofstadter|Hofstadter]], a formal system often simply defines all its well-formed formula as theorems.<ref>Hofstadter 1980</ref>{{Page needed|Also need to know the edition, and verify that in the references.  There are at least 4 English language editions of the book, in 1979, 1980, and two in 1999.|date=October 2010}}\n\nDifferent sets of derivation rules give rise to different interpretations of what it means for an expression to be a theorem. Some derivation rules and formal languages are intended to capture mathematical reasoning; the most common examples use [[first-order logic]]. Other deductive systems describe [[term rewriting]], such as the reduction rules for [[lambda calculus|\u03bb calculus]].\n\nThe definition of theorems as elements of a formal language allows for results in proof theory that study the structure of formal proofs and the structure of provable formulas. The most famous result is [[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems]]; by representing theorems about basic number theory as expressions in a formal language, and then representing this language within number theory itself, G\u00f6del constructed examples of statements that are neither provable nor disprovable from axiomatizations of number theory.\n{{Clear}}<!-- stop picture bleeding into completely unrelated next section -->\n\n[[File:Formal languages.svg|thumb|300px|right|This diagram shows the [[Syntax (logic)|syntactic entities]] that can be constructed from [[formal language]]s. The [[symbol (formal)|symbols]] and [[string (computer science)|strings of symbols]] may be broadly divided into [[nonsense]] and [[well-formed formula]]s. A formal language can be thought of as identical to the set of its well-formed formulas. The set of well-formed formulas may be broadly divided into theorems and non-theorems.]]\nA theorem may be expressed in a [[formal language]] (or \"formalized\"). A formal theorem is the purely formal analogue of a theorem. In general, a formal theorem is a type of [[well-formed formula]] that satisfies certain logical and syntactic conditions. The notation {{tee}} <math>S</math> is often used to indicate that <math>S</math> is a theorem.\n\nFormal theorems consist of [[Formula (mathematical logic)|formulas]] of a formal language and the [[transformation rule]]s of a formal system. Specifically, a formal theorem is always the last formula of a [[formal proof|derivation]] in some formal system, each formula of which is a [[logical consequence]] of the formulas that came before it in the derivation. The initially-accepted formulas in the derivation are called its '''axioms''', and are the basis on which the theorem is derived. A [[set (mathematics)|set]] of theorems is called a '''theory'''.\n\nWhat makes formal theorems useful and interesting is that they can be [[interpretation (logic)|interpreted]] as true [[proposition]]s and their derivations may be interpreted as a proof of the [[truth]] of the resulting expression. A set of formal theorems may be referred to as a '''[[theory (mathematical logic)|formal theory]]'''. A theorem whose interpretation is a true statement ''about'' a formal system (as opposed to ''of'' a formal system) is called a '''[[metatheorem]]'''.\n\n=== Syntax and semantics ===\n{{Main|Syntax (logic)|Formal semantics (logic)}}\n\nThe concept of a formal theorem is fundamentally syntactic, in contrast to the notion of a ''true proposition,'' which introduces [[semantics]]. Different deductive systems can yield other interpretations, depending on the presumptions of the derivation rules (i.e. [[belief]], [[Theory of justification|justification]] or other [[Modal logic|modalities]]). The [[soundness]] of a formal system depends on whether or not all of its theorems are also [[Validity (logic)|validities]]. A validity is a formula that is true under any possible interpretation (for example, in classical propositional logic, validities are [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]]). A formal system is considered [[completeness (logic)|semantically complete]] when all of its theorems are also tautologies.\n\n=== Derivation of a theorem ===\n\n{{refimprove|date=February 2020}}\n{{Main|Formal proof}}\n\nThe notion of a theorem is very closely connected to its formal proof (also called a \"derivation\"). As an illustration, consider a very simplified formal system <math>\\mathcal{FS}</math> whose alphabet consists of only two symbols { '''A''', '''B''' }, and whose formation rule for formulas is:\n:Any string of symbols of <math>\\mathcal{FS}</math> that is at least three symbols long, and is not infinitely long, is a formula. Nothing else is a formula.\n\nThe single axiom of <math>\\mathcal{FS}</math> is:\n:'''ABBA'''.\n\nThe only [[rule of inference]] (transformation rule) for <math>\\mathcal{FS}</math> is:\n:Any occurrence of \"'''A'''\" in a theorem may be replaced by an occurrence of the string \"'''AB'''\" and the result is a theorem.\n\nTheorems in <math>\\mathcal{FS}</math> are defined as those formulas that have a derivation ending with it. For example,\n\n#'''ABBA''' (Given as axiom)\n#'''ABBBA''' (by applying the transformation rule)\n#'''ABBBAB''' (by applying the transformation rule)\n\nis a derivation. Therefore, \"'''ABBBAB'''\" is a theorem of <math>\\mathcal{FS} \\,.</math> The notion of truth (or falsity) cannot be applied to the formula \"'''ABBBAB'''\" until an interpretation is given to its symbols. Thus in this example, the formula does not yet represent a proposition, but is merely an empty abstraction.\n\nTwo metatheorems of <math>\\mathcal{FS}</math> are:\n:Every theorem begins with \"'''A'''\".\n:Every theorem has exactly two \"'''A'''\"s.\n\n=== Interpretation of a formal theorem ===\n{{Main|Interpretation (logic)}}<!-- Wouldn't this fit better in the page \"formal theorem\"? -->\n\n=== Theorems and theories ===\n{{Main|Theory|Theory (mathematical logic)}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Philosophy|Mathematics}}\n* [[List of theorems]]\n*[[Fundamental theorem]]\n*[[Formula]]\n*[[Inference]]\n* [[Toy theorem]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|40em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{Cite book|authorlink=Archimedes|title=The works of Archimedes|last=Heath|first=Sir Thomas Little|publisher=Dover|year=1897|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FIY5AAAAMAAJ&dq=works+of+archimedes&printsec=frontcover&source=bl&ots=PRfqkNAFl-&sig=vRhyLwEr-wNV-bGsOB9eKas-63E&hl=en&ei=Smn_SuL6FZPElAfmj7SSCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CBAQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=theorem&f=false|accessdate=2009-11-15}}\n* {{Cite book|title = [[The Man Who Loved Only Numbers]]: The Story of Paul Erd\u0151s and the Search for Mathematical Truth|author = Hoffman, P.|publisher = Hyperion, New York| year = 1998|isbn=1-85702-829-5}}\n* {{Cite book\n | last = Hofstadter\n | first = Douglas\n | authorlink = Douglas Hofstadter\n | title = [[G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach]]: An Eternal Golden Braid\n | publisher = Basic Books\n | year = 1979\n}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Hunter|first=Geoffrey|authorlink=Geoffrey Hunter (logician)|title=Metalogic: An Introduction to the Metatheory of Standard First Order Logic |year=1996|origyear=1973|publisher=University of California Press |isbn=0-520-02356-0}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Mates|first=Benson|authorlink=Benson Mates|title=Elementary Logic|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1972|isbn=0-19-501491-X|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/elementarylogic00mate}}\n* {{Cite book|title=A = B|url=http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~wilf/AeqB.html|author1=Petkovsek, Marko|author2=Wilf, Herbert|author3=Zeilberger, Doron|publisher=A.K.
