[[Somatosensory system#Neural processing of social touch|Soft cutaneous touch]] is another sensory signal often included within the interoceptive processing system.\n\n== History and etymology ==\n\n=== Early to mid-1900s ===\nInteroception received increased visibility in the 21st century, but the concept was originally introduced by the Nobel Laureate [[Charles Scott Sherrington|Sir Charles S. Sherrington]] in 1906. Sherrington referred to interoception (although never stating the term, using \u201cinteroceptive\u201d instead<ref name=\":2\"/>) as a way to describe receptors in the body based on their location and function. Here, interoception was confined to the viscera, excluding all receptors and information from the body that would have been considered \u201cexteroceptive\u201d or \u201c[[Proprioception|proprioceptive]].\u201d In Sherrington's model, exteroceptive receptors received information from outward stimuli, like light, touch, sound, and odor. He classified [[Thermoception|temperature]] and [[nociception]] as exteroceptive sensations as well; however, these have now been regarded as having interoceptive qualities.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":5\"/> He further divided the internal milieu of the body by its [[Somatic nervous system|somatic]] and [[Autonomic nervous system|autonomic]] functions. Here, [[Proprioception|proprioceptors]] were localized to [[Skeletal muscle|skeletal tissue]], which control voluntary movement. [[Interoceptor]]s, a term which has lost prevalence in modern literature, were thus confined to visceral involuntary [[Smooth muscle tissue|smooth muscle]] (e.g. surrounding blood vessels).<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Integrative Action of the Nervous System|last=Sherrington|first=Charles S.|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1906|isbn=|location=New Haven, CT|pages=}}</ref>\n\nMany experiments were conducted in the 1950s and 1960s regarding interoceptive processing. However, research did not start immediately after Sherrington's discussion of interoceptors because a book by [[John Newport Langley]] was published stating that the [[autonomic nervous system]] only used [[Efferent nerve fiber|efferent]] (brain-to-body) signaling to implement its functions.<ref>{{Citation|last=Laureate Institute for Brain Research|title=Workshop 2: Integration- Dr. Lawrence Schramm|date=2017-06-07|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5J7JutmihoM&index=8&list=PLvHeXmlO4WQzbTE5NKcZ_ezPFuDpiSqP9|accessdate=2017-08-10}}</ref> This narrowed perspective halted research on interoceptive receptors for many years.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Interoception and Behaviour: an Experimental Study|last=\u00c1d\u00e1m|first=G.|publisher=Akad\u00e9miai Kiad\u00f3|year=1967|isbn=|location=Budapest|pages=}}</ref>  Once it became apparent that interoceptive receptors are present in many tissues of the body other researchers began to investigate afferent body-to-brain signals, mainly by conducting animal experiments to see if interoceptive conditioning was possible. Using principles of [[Classical conditioning|Pavlovian conditioning]], different physiological systems in dogs were perturbed to elicit a conditioned response to food.<ref name=\":0\" /> For example, in one experiment, dogs\u2019 pelvises were distended using infusions of solution when food was presented to them. After rounds of pairing the two, salivation occurred without presenting food once the pelvis was distended.<ref name=\":0\" /> Interoceptive conditioning studies like this illustrated that interoceptive sensations may be important for learned behavior and emotion.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Mid-1900s to 2000 ===\n[[File:Number of articles referencing interoception from 1905 to 2015.png|thumb|450x450px|This graph shows the number of articles that reference the term \u201cinteroception\u201d specifically from 1905 to 2015.

One definition widens the concept to encompass \u201cthe skin and all that is underneath the skin\u201d and the perception and function of bodily activity<ref name=\":4\" /> to more fully understand psychosomatic processes.<ref name=\":5\" /> In a similar vein, neuroanatomists hoping to find the anatomical basis of interoceptive functioning have stated the existence of a homeostatic pathway from the body to the brain that represents \u201cthe physiological status of all tissues in the body\u201d and that this mapping onto the brain provides an individual with subjective feeling states which are critical for human [[emotion]] and [[self-awareness]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nFor example, interoception is the fundament of the modern view on [[allostasis]] and [[allostatic load]]. The regulatory model of allostasis claims that the brain's primary role as an organ is the predictive regulation of internal sensations. [[Predictive homeostasis|Predictive regulation]] refers to the brain's ability to anticipate needs and prepare to fulfill them before they arise.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sterling|first=Peter|title=Allostasis: A model of predictive regulation|journal=Physiology & Behavior|volume=106|issue=1|pages=5\u201315|doi=10.1016/j.physbeh.2011.06.004|pmid=21684297|year=2012}}</ref> Therefore, in this model, the brain is responsible for efficient regulation of its internal milieu.\n\nInteroception is sometimes generally referred to as \u201cthe perception of internal body states\u201d<ref name=\":6\" /> although there are many interoceptive processes in the body which are not perceived.

Attention describes the ability to observe sensations within the body, it can be directed voluntarily in a \"[[Top-down and bottom-up design|top down]]\" manner or it can be attracted involuntarily in a \"[[Top-down and bottom-up design|bottom up]]\" manner. Detection reflects the presence or absence of a conscious report of interoceptive stimuli, like a heartbeat or growling stomach. Magnitude is the intensity of the stimulus, or how strongly the stimuli is felt. Discrimination describes the ability to localize interoceptive stimuli in the body to specific organs and differentiate them from other bodily stimuli that also occur, like distinguishing between a heart which is beating hard from an upset stomach. Accuracy (or sensitivity) refers to how precisely and correctly an individual can monitor specific interoceptive processes. Self-report is itself multifaceted. It describes the ability to reflect on interoceptive experiences occurring over different periods of time, make judgments about them, and describe them. [[Brain-body interaction]]s can also be studied using neuroimaging techniques to map functional interactions between brain and peripheral signals. Although all of these components of interoception have been studied since the mid-twentieth century, they have not been brought together under the umbrella-term \u201cinteroception\u201d until more recently.<ref name=\":3\" /> The term \"interoceptive awareness\" is also frequently used to encompass any (or all) of the different interoception features that are accessible to conscious self-report. This multifaceted approach offers a unified way of looking at interoceptive functioning and its different features, it clarifies the definition of interoception itself, and it informs structured ways of assessing interoceptive experiences in an individual.[[File:Facets of interoception.png|thumb|472x472px|This graph shows the number of articles published on interoception vs. articles published on interoceptive facets without directly referencing the term from 1905-2015.

Sherrington]] in 1906. Sherrington referred to interoception (although never stating the term, using \u201cinteroceptive\u201d instead<ref name=\":2\"/>) as a way to describe receptors in the body based on their location and function. Here, interoception was confined to the viscera, excluding all receptors and information from the body that would have been considered \u201cexteroceptive\u201d or \u201c[[Proprioception|proprioceptive]].\u201d In Sherrington's model, exteroceptive receptors received information from outward stimuli, like light, touch, sound, and odor. He classified [[Thermoception|temperature]] and [[nociception]] as exteroceptive sensations as well; however, these have now been regarded as having interoceptive qualities.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":5\"/> He further divided the internal milieu of the body by its [[Somatic nervous system|somatic]] and [[Autonomic nervous system|autonomic]] functions. Here, [[Proprioception|proprioceptors]] were localized to [[Skeletal muscle|skeletal tissue]], which control voluntary movement. [[Interoceptor]]s, a term which has lost prevalence in modern literature, were thus confined to visceral involuntary [[Smooth muscle tissue|smooth muscle]] (e.g. surrounding blood vessels).<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Integrative Action of the Nervous System|last=Sherrington|first=Charles S.|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1906|isbn=|location=New Haven, CT|pages=}}</ref>\n\nMany experiments were conducted in the 1950s and 1960s regarding interoceptive processing. However, research did not start immediately after Sherrington's discussion of interoceptors because a book by [[John Newport Langley]] was published stating that the [[autonomic nervous system]] only used [[Efferent nerve fiber|efferent]] (brain-to-body) signaling to implement its functions.<ref>{{Citation|last=Laureate Institute for Brain Research|title=Workshop 2: Integration- Dr. Lawrence Schramm|date=2017-06-07|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5J7JutmihoM&index=8&list=PLvHeXmlO4WQzbTE5NKcZ_ezPFuDpiSqP9|accessdate=2017-08-10}}</ref> This narrowed perspective halted research on interoceptive receptors for many years.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Interoception and Behaviour: an Experimental Study|last=\u00c1d\u00e1m|first=G.|publisher=Akad\u00e9miai Kiad\u00f3|year=1967|isbn=|location=Budapest|pages=}}</ref>  Once it became apparent that interoceptive receptors are present in many tissues of the body other researchers began to investigate afferent body-to-brain signals, mainly by conducting animal experiments to see if interoceptive conditioning was possible.

Attention describes the ability to observe sensations within the body, it can be directed voluntarily in a \"[[Top-down and bottom-up design|top down]]\" manner or it can be attracted involuntarily in a \"[[Top-down and bottom-up design|bottom up]]\" manner. Detection reflects the presence or absence of a conscious report of interoceptive stimuli, like a heartbeat or growling stomach. Magnitude is the intensity of the stimulus, or how strongly the stimuli is felt. Discrimination describes the ability to localize interoceptive stimuli in the body to specific organs and differentiate them from other bodily stimuli that also occur, like distinguishing between a heart which is beating hard from an upset stomach. Accuracy (or sensitivity) refers to how precisely and correctly an individual can monitor specific interoceptive processes. Self-report is itself multifaceted. It describes the ability to reflect on interoceptive experiences occurring over different periods of time, make judgments about them, and describe them. [[Brain-body interaction]]s can also be studied using neuroimaging techniques to map functional interactions between brain and peripheral signals. Although all of these components of interoception have been studied since the mid-twentieth century, they have not been brought together under the umbrella-term \u201cinteroception\u201d until more recently.<ref name=\":3\" /> The term \"interoceptive awareness\" is also frequently used to encompass any (or all) of the different interoception features that are accessible to conscious self-report.

We have called, in our contacts with the Chinese government at the highest level, for Mr Lee's immediate return to Hong Kong. We urge the Chinese and Hong Kong SAR governments to reassure the people of Hong Kong that law enforcement in the Hong Kong SAR is exclusively the responsibility of the Hong Kong SAR authorities, and that the fundamental rights and freedoms of Hong Kong residents will continue to be fully protected, and respected by all, in accordance with the Joint Declaration and Basic Law.\"<ref>https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/499940/The_Six_Monthly_Report_on_Hong_Kong_-_1_July_to_31_December_2015.pdf</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thestandnews.com/politics/%E8%8B%B1%E5%A4%96%E7%9B%B8%E7%99%BC%E8%A1%A8%E5%A0%B1%E5%91%8A-%E6%9D%8E%E6%B3%A2%E8%A2%AB%E9%9D%9E%E8%87%AA%E9%A1%98%E9%81%A3%E9%80%81%E4%B8%AD%E5%9C%8B-%E9%81%95%E5%8F%8D%E4%B8%AD%E8%8B%B1%E8%81%AF%E5%90%88%E8%81%B2%E6%98%8E/|title=\u82f1\u5916\u76f8\u767c\u8868\u5831\u544a\uff1a\u674e\u6ce2\u88ab\u975e\u81ea\u9858\u9063\u9001\u4e2d\u570b\u3000\u806f\u7d61\u5317\u4eac\u6700\u9ad8\u5c64\u4fc3\u653e\u4eba &#124; \u7acb\u5834\u5831\u9053 &#124; \u7acb\u5834\u65b0\u805e}}</ref>\n\n=== Destruction of first bookstore\u2019s stocks ===\nUp until the disappearances, the first bookstore maintained a stock of books for sale \u2013 in excess of 100,000 units \u2013 in two warehouses.

We have called, in our contacts with the Chinese government at the highest level, for Mr Lee's immediate return to Hong Kong. We urge the Chinese and Hong Kong SAR governments to reassure the people of Hong Kong that law enforcement in the Hong Kong SAR is exclusively the responsibility of the Hong Kong SAR authorities, and that the fundamental rights and freedoms of Hong Kong residents will continue to be fully protected, and respected by all, in accordance with the Joint Declaration and Basic Law.\"<ref>https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/499940/The_Six_Monthly_Report_on_Hong_Kong_-_1_July_to_31_December_2015.pdf</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thestandnews.com/politics/%E8%8B%B1%E5%A4%96%E7%9B%B8%E7%99%BC%E8%A1%A8%E5%A0%B1%E5%91%8A-%E6%9D%8E%E6%B3%A2%E8%A2%AB%E9%9D%9E%E8%87%AA%E9%A1%98%E9%81%A3%E9%80%81%E4%B8%AD%E5%9C%8B-%E9%81%95%E5%8F%8D%E4%B8%AD%E8%8B%B1%E8%81%AF%E5%90%88%E8%81%B2%E6%98%8E/|title=\u82f1\u5916\u76f8\u767c\u8868\u5831\u544a\uff1a\u674e\u6ce2\u88ab\u975e\u81ea\u9858\u9063\u9001\u4e2d\u570b\u3000\u806f\u7d61\u5317\u4eac\u6700\u9ad8\u5c64\u4fc3\u653e\u4eba &#124; \u7acb\u5834\u5831\u9053 &#124; \u7acb\u5834\u65b0\u805e}}</ref>\n\n=== Destruction of first bookstore\u2019s stocks ===\nUp until the disappearances, the first bookstore maintained a stock of books for sale \u2013 in excess of 100,000 units \u2013 in two warehouses.

The airport is located in the municipality of [[Culleredo]], approximately {{convert|7|km}} from the city center. It is a part of the network of airports managed by [[Aena]], a Spanish state-owned company responsible for airport management. Air traffic control is provided by [[NATS Holdings#Airports|Ferronats]]. In 2019, 1,352,583 passengers used the airport.\n\n== History ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}\n\n===Early years===\nOn 11 September 1953, the [[Council of Ministers of Spain]] ordered the urgent construction of an airport to serve the city of [[A Coru\u00f1a]]. This was the first airport to serve the area, as the hilly topography and meteorological conditions in the region made construction difficult. At the time, the only air service to the province of [[Galicia, Spain|Galicia]] was through the [[Santiago de Compostela Airport|Lavacolla Airport]] in [[Santiago de Compostela]], which opened in 1935.\n\nThe first airport was built on the Alvedro [[mesa|meseta]] in the municipality of [[Culleredo]]. The original air field was very sparse; subsequent projects included the construction of parking facilities and a terminal.\n\nIn 1961, radio, and electric monitoring facilities were constructed. In 1962, a terminal building was constructed, and landing lights and other signals were installed on the runway. At the same time, the legislature of A Coru\u00f1a ordered the construction of a road to connect the airport with the cities of A Coru\u00f1a and Santiago de Compostela. In 1963, a services building was added to the airport.\n\nThe construction was completed in May 1963, when the airport was opened to national commercial traffic. The inauguration of the airport took place on 25 May 1963, when the first commercial airliner arrived from [[Madrid]]. This first flight was operated by the Spanish [[Aviaco]] airline.\n\nDuring 1964, Aviaco operated a [[Vigo]]-[[A Coru\u00f1a]]-[[Santander, Cantabria|Santander]]-[[San Sebasti\u00e1n]]-[[Barcelona]] line served by [[Convair CV-240 family|Convair 440]]s. The routing proved to be spectacularly unpopular and unprofitable, and was discontinued after a year of service. A brief attempt in 1971 to run an identical routing was equally unsuccessful. By the end of the 1960s, the airport had begun receiving charter flights from Switzerland and London, England.\n\nA customs office was opened in 1979, and an air traffic control room was added in 1990. A number of improvements were made during the 1980s, including an increase of runway gradation of 1 degree 12 minutes and the installation of an [[Instrument Landing System]] (ILS).\n\n===Development since the 1990s===\n[[File:Alvedro2.jpg|thumb|Check-in counters]]\nBy 1994, yearly passenger numbers had surpassed 259,000. Further expansion of the airport and its facilities, including a new terminal building, as well as the urbanization of the surrounding area has prompted continuous growth and the increasing popularity of the airport. In 2001, the airport installed [[jet bridge]]s and a cargo terminal. Currently the airport has a single runway (03/21), {{convert|1940|m}} long, and is capable of supporting up to 12 take-offs and landings per hour.\n\nCurrent and future projects include the expansion of parking facilities, an upgrade of the ILS system from Category II to Category III, a short runway expansion, and expanded aircraft parking facilities.\n\n== Airlines and destinations ==\n{{Airport-dest-list\n<!-- -->\n|[[Air Europa]] | [[Adolfo Su\u00e1rez Madrid\u2013Barajas Airport|Madrid]]\n<!-- -->\n|[[Iberia (airline)|Iberia]] | [[Adolfo Su\u00e1rez Madrid\u2013Barajas Airport|Madrid]]\n<!-- -->\n| {{nowrap|[[Iberia Regional]]}} | [[Alicante Airport|Alicante]] , [[Adolfo Su\u00e1rez Madrid\u2013Barajas Airport|Madrid]], [[Valencia Airport|Valencia]] \n<!-- -->\n| [[Volotea]] | [[Bilbao Airport|Bilbao]]\n<!-- -->\n| [[Vueling]] | [[Barcelona\u2013El Prat Airport|Barcelona]], [[Bilbao Airport|Bilbao]], [[Gran Canaria Airport|Gran Canaria]], [[Heathrow Airport|London\u2013Heathrow]], [[Palma de Mallorca Airport|Palma de Mallorca]], [[Seville Airport|Seville]], [[Tenerife North Airport|Tenerife\u2013North]], [[Valencia Airport|Valencia]]\n<!-- -->\n}}\n\n==Accidents and incidents==\n*On 16 August 1973, [[Aviaco Flight 118]] crashed while trying to land at Alvedro Airport.

Despite their weakness at the point guard position, Bogues was left unprotected by the Bullets. On June 22, 1988 the Hornets selected him in the [[expansion draft]]. As Bogues settled in [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]], he established himself as an exceptional passer, a great [[steal (basketball)|stealer]], and one of the fastest players on the court.\n\nBogues spent ten years in Charlotte as the Hornets, led by [[Alonzo Mourning]] and [[Larry Johnson (basketball, born 1969)|Larry Johnson]], became one of the NBA's most popular teams{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} and a perennial playoff contender. Bogues was one of the most popular players in Hornets history. He is the Hornets' career leader in minutes played (19,768), assists (5,557), steals (1,067), turnovers (1,118), and assists per 48 minutes (13.5).\n\n===Later career===\nSix games into the [[1997\u201398 NBA season]], Bogues was traded, along with [[Tony Delk]], to the [[Golden State Warriors]] in exchange for [[B.

In his rookie year, Bogues was a teammate of [[Manute Bol]] who stood {{height|ft=7|in=7}} tall.

Bol and Bogues appeared on three magazine covers together.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nBogues blocked 39 shots as a professional player, including one by {{height|ft=7}} tall [[Patrick Ewing]], on April 14, 1993.

Despite their weakness at the point guard position, Bogues was left unprotected by the Bullets. On June 22, 1988 the Hornets selected him in the [[expansion draft]]. As Bogues settled in [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]], he established himself as an exceptional passer, a great [[steal (basketball)|stealer]], and one of the fastest players on the court.\n\nBogues spent ten years in Charlotte as the Hornets, led by [[Alonzo Mourning]] and [[Larry Johnson (basketball, born 1969)|Larry Johnson]], became one of the NBA's most popular teams{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} and a perennial playoff contender. Bogues was one of the most popular players in Hornets history. He is the Hornets' career leader in minutes played (19,768), assists (5,557), steals (1,067), turnovers (1,118), and assists per 48 minutes (13.5).\n\n===Later career===\nSix games into the [[1997\u201398 NBA season]], Bogues was traded, along with [[Tony Delk]], to the [[Golden State Warriors]] in exchange for [[B. J. Armstrong]]. Bogues played two seasons with the Warriors, and then signed as a [[free agent]] with the [[Toronto Raptors]], where he would finish his career. Although he was later traded to the [[New York Knicks]] and then to [[Dallas Mavericks]], he did not play in a game for either team.\n\n==NBA career statistics==\n{{NBA player statistics
