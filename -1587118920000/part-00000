The court of [[Pakubuwana]] in [[Surakarta]] is unique as it incorporates the ''alun-alun kidul'' within the defensive wall of the kraton proper.<ref name=\"Willem\">Studies in Indonesian archaeology, By Willem F Stutterheim, Netherlands Institute for International Cultural Relations and M.

At the two centrally located holy ''beringin'' or [[banyan]] trees, officials had their ''payung'' (ceremonial [[parasols]] indicating office), placed down by their parasol [[valet]].\n\nOrdinary commoner Javanese seeking an audience with the Regent would be required to sit and wait under the trees waiting for an official to leave the Kraton and ask their reason for an audience.\nDutch officials such as the Resident were commonly received with great ceremony to the ''alun-alun lor'' with the kraton soldiers firing three [[volleys]], which would be answered by a [[twenty-one gun salute]] from the Dutch fortress, especially between the Yogyakarta kraton and the Dutch [[Fort Vredeburg]]<ref>Cephas, Yogyakarta: Photography in the Service of the Sultan, G.

The official residence of the [[Regent]]'s ''\"Patih\"'', also ''Bupati'' (town or village head) was situated on the North or South.

Condemned criminals were publicly executed by ''krissing'' (using a [[keris]] to stab the condemned from the left shoulder blade downward into the heart) beside the enclosed banyan trees of the ''alun-alun lor''. For especially heinous criminals, most especially traitors and vicious [[brigands]] the condemned's head would be impaled on a [[pike (weapon)|pike]] as a macabre public warning <ref name=\"Ann\"/>\n\nThe ''alun-alun lor'' functioned and continues to function as centre for public spectacles, court celebrations and general non-court entertainment.

The court of [[Pakubuwana]] in [[Surakarta]] is unique as it incorporates the ''alun-alun kidul'' within the defensive wall of the kraton proper.<ref name=\"Willem\">Studies in Indonesian archaeology, By Willem F Stutterheim, Netherlands Institute for International Cultural Relations and M.

At the two centrally located holy ''beringin'' or [[banyan]] trees, officials had their ''payung'' (ceremonial [[parasols]] indicating office), placed down by their parasol [[valet]].\n\nOrdinary commoner Javanese seeking an audience with the Regent would be required to sit and wait under the trees waiting for an official to leave the Kraton and ask their reason for an audience.\nDutch officials such as the Resident were commonly received with great ceremony to the ''alun-alun lor'' with the kraton soldiers firing three [[volleys]], which would be answered by a [[twenty-one gun salute]] from the Dutch fortress, especially between the Yogyakarta kraton and the Dutch [[Fort Vredeburg]]<ref>Cephas, Yogyakarta: Photography in the Service of the Sultan, G.

The main [[mosque]] must be cited on the west side and hence correctly face east (to [[Mecca]]). The official residence of the [[Regent]]'s ''\"Patih\"'', also ''Bupati'' (town or village head) was situated on the North or South. East is generally reserved for shops, markets, or houses of prominent families.\n\nTwo enormous ''Pacikra'' or ''Pacikeran'' doors conventionally separate the high defensive perimeter wall surrounding the kraton and the ''alun-alun''.<ref name=\"Willem\"/>\n\nThe ''gladak'' or ''pradah'' compound for [[stables]], [[porters]] and [[draught horses]] was stationed outside the north gate of the ''alun-alun'', presumably for practicality for disembarking officials and to keep the smell of horses and manure  as far as possible from the kraton.<ref name=\"Ann\">Java and modern Europe: ambiguous encounters,  Ann Kumar, Routledge 1993, 472 pp.: {{ISBN|0-7007-0433-7}}, pp. 319\u2013320, 360</ref>\n\n==Historical function==\nThe ''alun-alun lor'' also historically functioned for a place for public [[corporal punishment]]s and executions. Condemned criminals were publicly executed by ''krissing'' (using a [[keris]] to stab the condemned from the left shoulder blade downward into the heart) beside the enclosed banyan trees of the ''alun-alun lor''. For especially heinous criminals, most especially traitors and vicious [[brigands]] the condemned's head would be impaled on a [[pike (weapon)|pike]] as a macabre public warning <ref name=\"Ann\"/>\n\nThe ''alun-alun lor'' functioned and continues to function as centre for public spectacles, court celebrations and general non-court entertainment. The Javanese festivals of ''Garebeganan'' and ''[[Sekaten]]'' great fairs were held here, as they are still held today, with the spectacle of huge mountains of rice exiting the kraton for blessings at  the mosque and distributed to the people in the ''alun-alun lor''. \nOccasionally a social and entertainment spectacle of a tiger and buffalo fight would be held, though from Sultan Hamengkubawana VII onward these were rare, as the Yogyakarta court tigers were incredibly useful for public sanitation as they were fed a diet of stray dogs.<ref>'Karaton Surakarta: A Look Into the Court of Surakarta Hadiningrat, Central Java'' By Paku Buwono, A.

In his work he called the quantity basic reproduction rate and denoted it by ''Z''<sub>0</sub>. Calling the quantity a \"rate\" can be misleading, insofar as it can be interpreted as number per unit of time. The expressions number or ratio are now preferred.\n\n== Definitions in specific cases ==\n=== Reproductive number as it relates to contact rate and infectious period ===\n[[File:R Naught Ebola and Flu Diagram.svg|thumb|''R''<sub>0</sub> is the average number of people infected from one other person, for example, Ebola has an ''R''<sub>0</sub> of two, so on average, a person who has Ebola will pass it on to two other people.]]\n\nSuppose that infectious individuals make an average of <math>\\beta</math> infection-producing contacts per unit time, with a mean infectious period of <math>\\tau</math>. Then the basic reproduction number is:\n\n:<math> R_0 = \\beta\\,\\tau</math>\n\nThis simple formula suggests different ways of reducing ''R''<sub>0</sub> and ultimately infection propagation. It is possible to decrease the number of infection-producing contacts per unit time <math>\\beta</math> by reducing the number of contacts per unit time (for example staying at home if the infection requires contact with others to propagate) or the proportion of contacts that produces infection (for example wearing some sort of protective equipment). It is also possible to decrease the infectious period <math>\\tau</math> by finding and then isolating, treating or eliminating (as is often the case with animals) infectious individuals as soon as possible.\n\n=== With varying latent periods ===\nLatent period is the transition time between contagion event and disease manifestation.  In cases of diseases with varying latent periods, the basic reproduction number can be calculated as the sum of the reproduction numbers for each transition time into the disease. An example of this is tuberculosis. Blower and coauthors calculated from a simple model of TB the following reproduction number:<ref>{{cite journal |last=Blower |first=S. M. |last2=Mclean |first2=A.

The definition must account for the fact that a typical infected individual may not be an average individual. As an extreme example, consider a population in which a small portion of the individuals mix fully with one another while the remaining individuals are all isolated. A disease may be able to spread in the fully mixed portion even though a randomly selected individual would lead to fewer than one secondary case. This is because the typical infected individual is in the fully mixed portion and thus is able to successfully cause infections. In general, if the individuals infected early in an epidemic are on average either more likely or less likely to transmit the infection than individuals infected late in the epidemic, then the computation of ''R''<sub>0</sub> must account for this difference. An appropriate definition for ''R''<sub>0</sub> in this case is \"the expected number of secondary cases produced by a typical infected individual early in an epidemic\".<ref name=\"Diekmann\">{{cite journal|author=O Diekmann|author2=J.A.P.

The difference is due to a subtle difference in the underlying growth model; the matrix equation above assumes that newly infected patients may start transmitting the disease directly after getting infected; the time <math>\\tau_E</math> is the average time. This difference illustrates that an estimated value of the reproduction number <math>R_0</math> is dependent on the underlying mathematical model; if the reproduction number is estimated from a particular model, the same model should be used for predictions about the future.\n\n==Limitations of ''R''<sub>0</sub>==\nWhen calculated from [[mathematical models]], particularly [[ordinary differential equation]]s, what is often claimed to be ''R''<sub>0</sub> is, in fact, simply a threshold, not the average number of secondary infections.

Then the basic reproduction number is:\n\n:<math> R_0 = \\beta\\,\\tau</math>\n\nThis simple formula suggests different ways of reducing ''R''<sub>0</sub> and ultimately infection propagation.

The definition must account for the fact that a typical infected individual may not be an average individual. As an extreme example, consider a population in which a small portion of the individuals mix fully with one another while the remaining individuals are all isolated. A disease may be able to spread in the fully mixed portion even though a randomly selected individual would lead to fewer than one secondary case. This is because the typical infected individual is in the fully mixed portion and thus is able to successfully cause infections. In general, if the individuals infected early in an epidemic are on average either more likely or less likely to transmit the infection than individuals infected late in the epidemic, then the computation of ''R''<sub>0</sub> must account for this difference. An appropriate definition for ''R''<sub>0</sub> in this case is \"the expected number of secondary cases produced by a typical infected individual early in an epidemic\".<ref name=\"Diekmann\">{{cite journal|author=O Diekmann|author2=J.A.P.

In the early stages of an epidemic, growth is exponential, with a logarithmic growth rate{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n:<math>K = \\frac{d\\ln(N)}{dt}.</math>\n\nFor exponential growth, <math>N</math> can be interpreted as the cumulative number of diagnoses (including individuals who have recovered) or the present number of diagnosed patients; the logarithmic growth rate is the same for either definition. In order to estimate <math>R_0</math>, assumptions are necessary about the time delay between infection and diagnosis and the time between infection and starting to be infectious.\n\nIn exponential growth, <math>K</math> is related to the [[doubling time]] <math>T_d</math> as\n:<math>K=\\frac{\\ln(2)}{T_d}</math>.\n\n=== Simple model ===\nIf an individual, after getting infected, infects exactly <math>R_0</math> new individuals after exactly a time <math>\\tau</math> has passed, then the number of exposed (not recovered) individuals over time is\n:<math>n_E(t) = n_E(0)\\, R_0^{t/\\tau}.</math>\nIn this case,\n:<math>R_0 = e^{K \\tau}</math> or <math>K = \\frac{\\ln R_0}{\\tau}</math>.\nFor example, with <math>\\tau=5~\\mathrm{d}</math> and <math>K=0.183~\\mathrm{d}^{-1}</math>, we would find <math>R_0=2.5</math>. \n\n=== Latent infectious period, isolation after diagnosis ===\nIn this model, an individual infection has the following stages:\n\n# Exposed: an individual is infected, but has no symptoms and does not yet infect others. The average duration of the exposed state is <math>\\tau_E</math>.\n# Latent infectious: an individual is infected, has no symptoms, but does infect others. The average duration of the latent infectious state is <math>\\tau_I</math>.

For example, with the same values <math>\\tau=5~\\mathrm{d}</math> and <math>K=0.183~\\mathrm{d}^{-1}</math>, we would find <math>R_0=1.9</math>, rather than <math>2.5</math>. The difference is due to a subtle difference in the underlying growth model; the matrix equation above assumes that newly infected patients may start transmitting the disease directly after getting infected; the time <math>\\tau_E</math> is the average time. This difference illustrates that an estimated value of the reproduction number <math>R_0</math> is dependent on the underlying mathematical model; if the reproduction number is estimated from a particular model, the same model should be used for predictions about the future.\n\n==Limitations of ''R''<sub>0</sub>==\nWhen calculated from [[mathematical models]], particularly [[ordinary differential equation]]s, what is often claimed to be ''R''<sub>0</sub> is, in fact, simply a threshold, not the average number of secondary infections. There are many methods used to derive such a threshold from a mathematical model, but few of them always give the true value of ''R''<sub>0</sub>.

She was presumed murdered after her skeletal remains were found in [[Rock Creek Park]] in May 2002. The case attracted attention from the American news media for several years.\n\nDue to a miscommunication, the [[Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia]] (MPD) failed to follow its own search parameters in Rock Creek Park, leaving Levy's body to decompose for a year. Further, the MPD had been informed, but soon dismissed the information that [[#Identification of the prime suspect|Ingmar Guandique]], already arrested for attacking women in Rock Creek Park, had confessed to attacking Levy. The MPD instead put much of its focus on the revelation that Levy had been having an [[Affair#Extramarital affair|affair]] with [[U.S. Representative|Congressman]] [[Gary Condit]], a married [[United States Democratic Party|Democrat]] then serving his fifth term representing [[California's 18th congressional district]], and a senior member of the [[House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]]. Condit had an overwhelming alibi (he was in meetings with the Vice President), was never named as a suspect by police, and was eventually cleared of any involvement in the disappearance. However, due to the cloud of suspicion raised by the intense media focus on the missing intern and the later revelation of the affair, Condit lost his bid for re-election in 2002.\n\nFollowing a series of investigative reports by ''[[The Washington Post]]'' in 2008, the MPD followed up and finally obtained a warrant, on March 3, 2009, to arrest Ingmar Guandique, identified and dismissed by the MPD eight years earlier.<!-- Please see discussion page regarding terminology. \"Undocumented Immigrant\" refers to the Wikipedia page \"Illegal immigration. The page itself is referred to as illegal immigration so the term \"illegal immigrant\" is proper. The consensus on the talk page reaffirmed the use of this term. --> He had been convicted of assaulting two other women in Rock Creek Park around the time of Levy's disappearance and was still in prison on those convictions when the arrest warrant on Levy's death was issued. Prosecutors alleged that Guandique had attacked and tied up Levy in a remote area of the park and left her to die of dehydration or exposure. In November 2010, Guandique was convicted of murdering Levy; he was sentenced in February 2011 to 60 years in prison. In June 2015, however, Guandique was granted a new trial. On July 28, 2016, prosecutors announced that they would not proceed with the case against Guandique and would, instead, seek to have him deported. In episode 3 of \"An American Murder Mystery\" on the case, it is mentioned that in March 2017 Guandique lost his bid to remain in the United States and was deported to his native El Salvador on May 5, 2017. Levy's murder remains unsolved.\n\n==Life and background==\n[[File:Federal Home Loan Bank Board Building.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Levy interned at the central office of the [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]] in Washington, D.C.<ref name=\"Life-Getty-20010719\">{{cite news|last=Mathieson|first=Greg|url=http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/50411595/TIME-LIFE-Images|title=Chandra Levy|quote=HOLC Building containing Bureau of Prisons office where missing intern Chandra Levy worked before her disappearance.|journal=[[Life (magazine)|Life]]|agency=[[Getty Images]]|date=July 19, 2001|accessdate=December 23, 2010}}</ref>]]\nLevy was born in [[Cleveland]], Ohio, to Robert and Susan Levy; the family moved to [[Modesto, California]], where she attended [[Grace M.

The MPD instead put much of its focus on the revelation that Levy had been having an [[Affair#Extramarital affair|affair]] with [[U.S. Representative|Congressman]] [[Gary Condit]], a married [[United States Democratic Party|Democrat]] then serving his fifth term representing [[California's 18th congressional district]], and a senior member of the [[House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]]. Condit had an overwhelming alibi (he was in meetings with the Vice President), was never named as a suspect by police, and was eventually cleared of any involvement in the disappearance. However, due to the cloud of suspicion raised by the intense media focus on the missing intern and the later revelation of the affair, Condit lost his bid for re-election in 2002.\n\nFollowing a series of investigative reports by ''[[The Washington Post]]'' in 2008, the MPD followed up and finally obtained a warrant, on March 3, 2009, to arrest Ingmar Guandique, identified and dismissed by the MPD eight years earlier.<!-- Please see discussion page regarding terminology. \"Undocumented Immigrant\" refers to the Wikipedia page \"Illegal immigration. The page itself is referred to as illegal immigration so the term \"illegal immigrant\" is proper. The consensus on the talk page reaffirmed the use of this term. --> He had been convicted of assaulting two other women in Rock Creek Park around the time of Levy's disappearance and was still in prison on those convictions when the arrest warrant on Levy's death was issued. Prosecutors alleged that Guandique had attacked and tied up Levy in a remote area of the park and left her to die of dehydration or exposure. In November 2010, Guandique was convicted of murdering Levy; he was sentenced in February 2011 to 60 years in prison. In June 2015, however, Guandique was granted a new trial. On July 28, 2016, prosecutors announced that they would not proceed with the case against Guandique and would, instead, seek to have him deported. In episode 3 of \"An American Murder Mystery\" on the case, it is mentioned that in March 2017 Guandique lost his bid to remain in the United States and was deported to his native El Salvador on May 5, 2017. Levy's murder remains unsolved.\n\n==Life and background==\n[[File:Federal Home Loan Bank Board Building.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Levy interned at the central office of the [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]] in Washington, D.C.<ref name=\"Life-Getty-20010719\">{{cite news|last=Mathieson|first=Greg|url=http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/50411595/TIME-LIFE-Images|title=Chandra Levy|quote=HOLC Building containing Bureau of Prisons office where missing intern Chandra Levy worked before her disappearance.|journal=[[Life (magazine)|Life]]|agency=[[Getty Images]]|date=July 19, 2001|accessdate=December 23, 2010}}</ref>]]\nLevy was born in [[Cleveland]], Ohio, to Robert and Susan Levy; the family moved to [[Modesto, California]], where she attended [[Grace M.

He played for the Athletic Club in the Wellington competition.

Then on August 7 just 3 days later Loveridge travelled down to Christchurch to make his test debut for New Zealand. The match was played at Lancaster Park with 6,000 spectators present.

Loveridge\u2019s performance at fullback came in for some comment by the scribes of the time. The general consensus being that he was too hesitant in the fullback position and hung on to the ball too long. The writer for the ''Sun'' (Christchurch) said that he was \u201cweak\u201d, and that \u201che misjudged several kicks, and was tackled in possession on a number of occasions. In addition he missed his man two of three times through lack of determination\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Rugby League/Second Test Match\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Sun (Christchurch), Volume VII, Issue 2023\n| date = 1920-08-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/SUNCH19200809.2.6.6\n| accessdate = 2020-04-17}}</ref>. The writer for the ''Star'' said that \u201cLoveridge nearly had the team in difficulties through holding on too long. By a stroke of good luck however he was able to relieve the position by marking just in front of the posts\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = England Wins, Nineteen Points to Three/Mud Scramble on Lancaster Park\n| page = 10\n| publisher = Star, Issue 20019\n| date = 1920-08-07\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/TS19200807.2.72\n| accessdate = 2020-04-17}}</ref>. The ''Lyttelton Times'' writer described a passage of play where \u201cLoveridge failed to beat [[Harold Wagstaff|Wagstaff]] before kicking. He was collared, and it looked as if the Englishmen were likely to score\u201d and later a passing rush by England \u201cended in [[Billy Stone (rugby league)|Stone]] side stepping Loveridge and dashing over at the corner <ref>{{cite news\n| title = The League Game/English Team Wins Second Test Match\n| page = 9\n| publisher = Lyttelton Times, 9 August 1920\n| date = 1920-08-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/LT19200809.2.71\n| accessdate = 2020-04-17}}</ref>.\n\nThis was to be his only test match for New Zealand. In fact Loveridge did not even pull on the Auckland jersey. In 1921 and 1922 he continued to play for Marist in the [[Auckland Rugby League]] competition. He scored a try in a 27-15 win over [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]] at the [[Auckland Domain]] and he kicked 5 goals in other matches <ref>{{cite news\n| title =City\u2019s Easy Victory/Wins to Ponsonby and Newton\n| page =7\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=LIII| issue=161\n| date = 1922-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19220710.2.118\n| accessdate = 2019-08-27}}</ref>. Loveridge stopped playing for Marist at the end of this season and does not appear to have played again.

Loveridge\u2019s performance at fullback came in for some comment by the scribes of the time. The general consensus being that he was too hesitant in the fullback position and hung on to the ball too long. The writer for the ''Sun'' (Christchurch) said that he was \u201cweak\u201d, and that \u201che misjudged several kicks, and was tackled in possession on a number of occasions.

The ''Lyttelton Times'' writer described a passage of play where \u201cLoveridge failed to beat [[Harold Wagstaff|Wagstaff]] before kicking. He was collared, and it looked as if the Englishmen were likely to score\u201d and later a passing rush by England \u201cended in [[Billy Stone (rugby league)|Stone]] side stepping Loveridge and dashing over at the corner <ref>{{cite news\n| title = The League Game/English Team Wins Second Test Match\n| page = 9\n| publisher = Lyttelton Times, 9 August 1920\n| date = 1920-08-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/LT19200809.2.71\n| accessdate = 2020-04-17}}</ref>.\n\nThis was to be his only test match for New Zealand. In fact Loveridge did not even pull on the Auckland jersey. In 1921 and 1922 he continued to play for Marist in the [[Auckland Rugby League]] competition. He scored a try in a 27-15 win over [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]] at the [[Auckland Domain]] and he kicked 5 goals in other matches <ref>{{cite news\n| title =City\u2019s Easy Victory/Wins to Ponsonby and Newton\n| page =7\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=LIII| issue=161\n| date = 1922-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19220710.2.118\n| accessdate = 2019-08-27}}</ref>.
