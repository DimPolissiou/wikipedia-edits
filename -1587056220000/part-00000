In this painting, only the ''action'' that takes place there identifies the setting as distinct from the Garden of the Hesperides, with its golden fruit.\n* The Persian term \"[[paradise]]\" (borrowed as {{lang-he|\u05e4\u05e8\u05d3\u05e1}}, ''pardes''), meaning a royal garden or hunting-park, gradually became a synonym for Eden after c. 500&nbsp;BCE. The word \"''pardes''\" occurs three times in the Hebrew Bible, but always in contexts other than a connection with Eden: in the [[Song of Solomon]] iv. 13: \"Thy plants are an orchard (''pardes'') of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits; camphire, with spikenard\"; [[Ecclesiastes]] 2. 5: \"I made me gardens and orchards (''pardes''), and I planted trees in them of all kind of fruits\"; and in [[Nehemiah]] ii. 8: \"And a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the king's orchard (''pardes''), that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which appertained to the house, and for the wall of the city.\" In these examples ''pardes'' clearly means \"orchard\" or \"park\", but in the [[apocalyptic literature]] and in the [[Talmud]] \"paradise\" gains its associations with the Garden of Eden and its heavenly prototype, and in the [[New Testament]] \"paradise\" becomes the realm of the blessed (as opposed to the realm of the cursed) among those who have already died, with literary [[Hellenistic]] influences.\n\n==Other views==\n===Jewish eschatology===\nIn the [[Talmud]] and the Jewish [[Kabbalah]],<ref name=\"Gan Eden\">[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=39&letter=E Gan Eden] \u2013 JewishEncyclopedia; 02-22-2010.</ref> the scholars agree that there are two types of spiritual places called \"Garden in Eden\". The first is rather terrestrial, of abundant fertility and luxuriant vegetation, known as the \"lower Gan Eden\". The second is envisioned as being celestial, the habitation of righteous, Jewish and non-Jewish, immortal souls, known as the \"higher Gan Eden\". The [[rabbi]]s differentiate between ''Gan'' and Eden. Adam is said to have dwelt only in the ''Gan'', whereas Eden is said never to be witnessed by any mortal eye.<ref name=\"Gan Eden\"/>\n\nAccording to [[Jewish eschatology]],<ref>[http://www.jewfaq.org/olamhaba.htm Olam Ha-Ba \u2013 The Afterlife] - JewFAQ.org; 02-22-2010.</ref><ref name=\"Eshatology\">[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=460&letter=E#1239 Eshatology] \u2013 JewishEncyclopedia; 02-22-2010.</ref> the higher Gan Eden is called the \"Garden of Righteousness\". It has been created since the beginning of the world, and will appear gloriously at the end of time. The righteous dwelling there will enjoy the sight of the heavenly ''[[chayot]]'' carrying the throne of God. Each of the righteous will walk with God, who will lead them in a dance.

Among the legends are ones about the two Gardens of Eden. Beyond Paradise is the higher Gan Eden, where God is enthroned and explains the Torah to its inhabitants. The higher Gan Eden contains three hundred ten worlds and is divided into seven compartments. The compartments are not described, though it is implied that each compartment is greater than the previous one and is joined based on one's merit.  The first compartment is for Jewish martyrs, the second for those who drowned, the third for \"Rabbi Johanan ben Zakkai and his disciples,\" the fourth for those whom the cloud of glory carried off, the fifth for penitents, the sixth for youths who have never sinned; and the seventh for the poor who lived decently and studied the Torah.<ref name=Legends>[https://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/loj/loj103.htm The Sacred Texts: Legends of the Jews, Chapter 1]</ref>\n\nIn chapter two, Legends of the Jews gives a brief description of the lower Gan Eden. The tree of knowledge is a hedge around the tree of life, and it is so vast that it would take one over five hundred years to clear a path through the tree of knowledge to reach the tree of life. From beneath the trees flow all the world's waters in the form of four rivers: Tigris, Nile, Euphrates, and Ganges. After the fall of man, the world was no longer irrigated by this water. While in the garden, though, Adam and Eve were served meat dishes by angels and the animals of the world understood human language, respected mankind as God's image, and feared Adam and Eve. When one dies, one's soul must pass through the lower Gan Eden in order to reach the higher Gan Eden. The way to the garden is the Cave of Machpelah that Adam guards.  The cave leads to the gate of the garden, guarded by a cherub with a flaming sword. If a soul is unworthy of entering, the sword annihilates it. Within the garden is a pillar of fire and smoke that extends to the higher Gan Eden, which the soul must climb in order to reach the higher Gan Eden.<ref name=Legends/>\n\n===Islamic view===\n[[File:Spanish-Arabic map of 1109.jpg|thumb|[[Mozarabic art|Mozarabic]] world map from 1109 with Eden in the East (at top)]]\nThe term ''jann\u0101t \u02bfadni'' (\"Gardens of Eden\" or \"Gardens of Perpetual Residence\") is used in the [[Quran|Qur'an]] for the destination of the righteous.

The narrative mainly surrounds the resulting expulsion of Hawwa and Adam after they were tempted by [[Shaitan]]. Despite the Biblical account, the Quran mentions only one tree in Eden, the tree of immortality, which [[God in Islam|God]] specifically claimed it was forbidden to Adam and Eve. Some [[tafsir|exegesis]] added an account, about [[Satan]], disguised as a serpent to enter the Garden, repeatedly told Adam to eat from the tree, and eventually both Adam and Eve did so, resulting in disobeying God.<ref>Leaman, Oliver ''The Quran, an encyclopedia'', p. 11, 2006</ref> These stories are also featured in the [[hadith]] collections, including [[al-Tabari]].<ref>Wheeler, Brannon ''Mecca and Eden: ritual, relics, and territory in Islam'' p. 16, 2006</ref>\n\n===Latter Day Saints===\n{{see also|Adam and Eve (LDS Church)}}\nFollowers of the [[Latter Day Saints movement]] (also known as [[Mormons]]) believe that after Adam and Eve were expelled from the Garden of Eden they resided in a place known as [[Adam-ondi-Ahman]], located in present-day [[Daviess County, Missouri]].

In this painting, only the ''action'' that takes place there identifies the setting as distinct from the Garden of the Hesperides, with its golden fruit.\n* The Persian term \"[[paradise]]\" (borrowed as {{lang-he|\u05e4\u05e8\u05d3\u05e1}}, ''pardes''), meaning a royal garden or hunting-park, gradually became a synonym for Eden after c. 500&nbsp;BCE. The word \"''pardes''\" occurs three times in the Hebrew Bible, but always in contexts other than a connection with Eden: in the [[Song of Solomon]] iv. 13: \"Thy plants are an orchard (''pardes'') of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits; camphire, with spikenard\"; [[Ecclesiastes]] 2. 5: \"I made me gardens and orchards (''pardes''), and I planted trees in them of all kind of fruits\"; and in [[Nehemiah]] ii. 8: \"And a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the king's orchard (''pardes''), that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which appertained to the house, and for the wall of the city.\" In these examples ''pardes'' clearly means \"orchard\" or \"park\", but in the [[apocalyptic literature]] and in the [[Talmud]] \"paradise\" gains its associations with the Garden of Eden and its heavenly prototype, and in the [[New Testament]] \"paradise\" becomes the realm of the blessed (as opposed to the realm of the cursed) among those who have already died, with literary [[Hellenistic]] influences.\n\n==Other views==\n===Jewish eschatology===\nIn the [[Talmud]] and the Jewish [[Kabbalah]],<ref name=\"Gan Eden\">[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=39&letter=E Gan Eden] \u2013 JewishEncyclopedia; 02-22-2010.</ref> the scholars agree that there are two types of spiritual places called \"Garden in Eden\". The first is rather terrestrial, of abundant fertility and luxuriant vegetation, known as the \"lower Gan Eden\". The second is envisioned as being celestial, the habitation of righteous, Jewish and non-Jewish, immortal souls, known as the \"higher Gan Eden\". The [[rabbi]]s differentiate between ''Gan'' and Eden. Adam is said to have dwelt only in the ''Gan'', whereas Eden is said never to be witnessed by any mortal eye.<ref name=\"Gan Eden\"/>\n\nAccording to [[Jewish eschatology]],<ref>[http://www.jewfaq.org/olamhaba.htm Olam Ha-Ba \u2013 The Afterlife] - JewFAQ.org; 02-22-2010.</ref><ref name=\"Eshatology\">[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=460&letter=E#1239 Eshatology] \u2013 JewishEncyclopedia; 02-22-2010.</ref> the higher Gan Eden is called the \"Garden of Righteousness\". It has been created since the beginning of the world, and will appear gloriously at the end of time. The righteous dwelling there will enjoy the sight of the heavenly ''[[chayot]]'' carrying the throne of God. Each of the righteous will walk with God, who will lead them in a dance.

Among the legends are ones about the two Gardens of Eden. Beyond Paradise is the higher Gan Eden, where God is enthroned and explains the Torah to its inhabitants. The higher Gan Eden contains three hundred ten worlds and is divided into seven compartments. The compartments are not described, though it is implied that each compartment is greater than the previous one and is joined based on one's merit.  The first compartment is for Jewish martyrs, the second for those who drowned, the third for \"Rabbi Johanan ben Zakkai and his disciples,\" the fourth for those whom the cloud of glory carried off, the fifth for penitents, the sixth for youths who have never sinned; and the seventh for the poor who lived decently and studied the Torah.<ref name=Legends>[https://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/loj/loj103.htm The Sacred Texts: Legends of the Jews, Chapter 1]</ref>\n\nIn chapter two, Legends of the Jews gives a brief description of the lower Gan Eden. The tree of knowledge is a hedge around the tree of life, and it is so vast that it would take one over five hundred years to clear a path through the tree of knowledge to reach the tree of life. From beneath the trees flow all the world's waters in the form of four rivers: Tigris, Nile, Euphrates, and Ganges. After the fall of man, the world was no longer irrigated by this water. While in the garden, though, Adam and Eve were served meat dishes by angels and the animals of the world understood human language, respected mankind as God's image, and feared Adam and Eve. When one dies, one's soul must pass through the lower Gan Eden in order to reach the higher Gan Eden. The way to the garden is the Cave of Machpelah that Adam guards.  The cave leads to the gate of the garden, guarded by a cherub with a flaming sword. If a soul is unworthy of entering, the sword annihilates it. Within the garden is a pillar of fire and smoke that extends to the higher Gan Eden, which the soul must climb in order to reach the higher Gan Eden.<ref name=Legends/>\n\n===Islamic view===\n[[File:Spanish-Arabic map of 1109.jpg|thumb|[[Mozarabic art|Mozarabic]] world map from 1109 with Eden in the East (at top)]]\nThe term ''jann\u0101t \u02bfadni'' (\"Gardens of Eden\" or \"Gardens of Perpetual Residence\") is used in the [[Quran|Qur'an]] for the destination of the righteous. There are several mentions of \"the Garden\" in the Qur'an (2:35, 7:19, 20:117), while the Garden of Eden, without the word ''\u02bfadn'',<ref>See [http://corpus.quran.com/search.jsp?q=lem%3AEadon+pos%3Apn list of occurrences].</ref> is commonly the fourth layer of the Islamic [[Jannah|heaven]] and not necessarily thought as the dwelling place of [[Adam in Islam|Adam]].<ref>Patrick Hughes, Thomas Patrick Hughes ''Dictionary of Islam'' Asian Educational Services 1995 {{ISBN|978-8-120-60672-2}} p. 133</ref> The Quran refers frequently over various [[Surah]] about the first abode of Adam and Hawwa (Eve), including surat [[Sad (surah)|Sad]], which features 18 verses on the subject (38:71\u201388), surat [[al-Baqara]], surat [[al-A'raf]], and surat [[al-Hijr (surah)|al-Hijr]] although sometimes without mentioning the location. The narrative mainly surrounds the resulting expulsion of Hawwa and Adam after they were tempted by [[Shaitan]]. Despite the Biblical account, the Quran mentions only one tree in Eden, the tree of immortality, which [[God in Islam|God]] specifically claimed it was forbidden to Adam and Eve. Some [[tafsir|exegesis]] added an account, about [[Satan]], disguised as a serpent to enter the Garden, repeatedly told Adam to eat from the tree, and eventually both Adam and Eve did so, resulting in disobeying God.<ref>Leaman, Oliver ''The Quran, an encyclopedia'', p. 11, 2006</ref> These stories are also featured in the [[hadith]] collections, including [[al-Tabari]].<ref>Wheeler, Brannon ''Mecca and Eden: ritual, relics, and territory in Islam'' p. 16, 2006</ref>\n\n===Latter Day Saints===\n{{see also|Adam and Eve (LDS Church)}}\nFollowers of the [[Latter Day Saints movement]] (also known as [[Mormons]]) believe that after Adam and Eve were expelled from the Garden of Eden they resided in a place known as [[Adam-ondi-Ahman]], located in present-day [[Daviess County, Missouri]].

The idyll of \"Naming Day in Eden\" was less often depicted. Much of [[John Milton|Milton's]] ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' occurs in the Garden of Eden. [[Michelangelo]] depicted a [[:File:Michelangelo Buonarroti 022.jpg|scene]] at the Garden of Eden in the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]]. In ''[[Divine Comedy|the Divine Comedy]]'', [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] places the Garden at the top of [[Purgatory|Mt. Purgatory]].

Over the years the Portuguese built up an [[army]] of 6,000 men, considerably more than the 1,450 Spanish [[Spanish Army|troops]] in the area. The matter escalated in February 1776 when two Portuguese [[Naval fleet|fleet]]s under [[Robert MacDouall]] and [[Jorge Hardcastle]] landed [[Portuguese Army|troops]] near the [[fortress]] of Rio Grande de S\u00e3o Pedro, and started shelling the Spanish fort. A Spanish [[Spanish Navy|fleet]] under [[Francisco Javier Morales]] drove off the Portuguese [[Portuguese Navy|fleet]] after a three-hour battle where the Spanish fleet suffered sixteen killed and 24 wounded, while the Portuguese lost two vessels.\n\nPortuguese land forces pushed forward and the Spanish commander [[Juan Jos\u00e9 de V\u00e9rtiz y Salcedo]] was forced to withdraw and give up the entire [[Rio Grande do Sul|Rio Grande]] area.\n\n==Spanish response==\nThe response of the Spanish King [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]] was swift. There was little fear that Portugal's old ally [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] would come to their aid, as it was fully occupied by the [[American War of Independence|American Revolutionary War]].\n\nKing Charles III promoted Governor [[Pedro Antonio de Cevallos]] to [[Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata|Viceroy of the R\u00edo de la Plata]] and gave him the leadership of the expedition. Cevallos had already proven his ability in the First Cevallos expedition (1762\u20131763), when he had conquered Colonia del Sacramento and had marched deep into Portuguese territory.\n\nCevallos was in Spain and organized personally the expedition from [[Cadiz]]. He had 9,000 men, and a fleet of six [[warship]]s (''Poderoso'', 70 [[Naval artillery|gun]]s, ''Santiago la Am\u00e9rica'', 64, ''San D\u00e1maso'', 70,  ''Septentri\u00f3n'', 70, ''Monarca'', 70,  and ''San Jos\u00e9'', 70), six [[frigate]]s, a number of smaller ships and a hundred transport ships at his disposal. The commander of the fleet was Francisco Javier Everardo Tilly y Garc\u00eda de Paredes, marqu\u00e9s de Casa Tilly. The fleet left Cadiz on 20 November and arrived in [[South America]] on 18 February 1777, capturing several Portuguese ships on the way .\n\n\nThere they encountered the Portuguese fleet of Robert MacDouall, which was much smaller and managed to escape.\n\nCevallos decided to attack the island of [[Santa Catarina (island)|Santa Catarina]] on 23 February. When the Portuguese saw the formidable Spanish fleet disembark their troops, the [[garrison]] fled to the mainland without firing a shot. On 20 March, Cevallos sailed towards his second target, Rio Grande de S\u00e3o Pedro, but the fleet was dispersed by a storm and had to return to [[Montevideo]].\n\nThere he split up his forces. He sailed himself with all the [[artillery]] to Colonia de Sacramento, where he started the siege on 23 May. The city capitulated on 3 June.\n\nThe rest of the fleet was sent to check the fleet of MacDouall, which was still a menace to be counted with. In fact this fleet surprised and captured the lone ''San Agust\u00edn'', and renamed the ship ''Santo Agostinho''. The new captain, who also played an important role in capturing the ship was an [[English people|Englishman]] in Portuguese service, [[Arthur Phillip]] who later founded [[Port Jackson]] ([[Sydney]]).\n  \nAfter the capture of Sacramento, Cevallos marched his troops towards Rio Grande de S\u00e3o Pedro, joined forces with the troops of Juan Jos\u00e9 Vertiz which were concentrated in Santa Teresa. Then he was ordered to stop his advance, as peace negotiations were started.\n\n==Peace==\nOn 24 February 1777 King [[Joseph I of Portugal|Joseph I]] died and his daughter and successor [[Maria I of Portugal|Maria I]] dismissed [[Sebasti\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquis of Pombal|Pombal]] and concluded on 1 October the [[First Treaty of San Ildefonso]] with Spain.\n\nSpain returned the island of Santa Catarina to Portugal and recognized Rio Grande de S\u00e3o Pedro as Portuguese territory, but kept Colonia del Sacramento, which the Portuguese had founded in 1680,<ref>Robert S. Chamberlain, \"Latin America\", in ''An Encyclopedia of History'' (1948), Revised Edition, Boston:  Houghton Mifflin, p. 501.</ref>, with the rest of the [[Banda Oriental]] ([[Uruguay]]), and also kept the [[Misiones Orientales]].  In return, Spain acknowledged that the Portuguese territories in Brazil extended far west of the line that had been set in the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]].<ref>Robert S. Chamberlain, \"Latin America\", in ''An Encyclopedia of History'' (1948), Revised Edition, Boston:  Houghton Mifflin, p. 502.</ref>  \n\nIn the [[Treaty of El Pardo (1778)|Treaty of El Pardo]], signed on 11 March 1778, Spain won [[Spanish Guinea]]<ref>\"Spanish Guinea\", in ''The Columbia-Viking Desk Encyclopedia'' (1953), New York:  Viking.</ref> ([[Equatorial Guinea]]), which would be administered from [[Buenos Aires]] from 1778 to 1810.\n\n==Aftermath==\nOne of the results of the war was that the Portuguese remained neutral when the [[American War of Independence]] became a global war in 1778 with the entry of the [[French people|French]].

Over the years the Portuguese built up an [[army]] of 6,000 men, considerably more than the 1,450 Spanish [[Spanish Army|troops]] in the area. The matter escalated in February 1776 when two Portuguese [[Naval fleet|fleet]]s under [[Robert MacDouall]] and [[Jorge Hardcastle]] landed [[Portuguese Army|troops]] near the [[fortress]] of Rio Grande de S\u00e3o Pedro, and started shelling the Spanish fort. A Spanish [[Spanish Navy|fleet]] under [[Francisco Javier Morales]] drove off the Portuguese [[Portuguese Navy|fleet]] after a three-hour battle where the Spanish fleet suffered sixteen killed and 24 wounded, while the Portuguese lost two vessels.\n\nPortuguese land forces pushed forward and the Spanish commander [[Juan Jos\u00e9 de V\u00e9rtiz y Salcedo]] was forced to withdraw and give up the entire [[Rio Grande do Sul|Rio Grande]] area.\n\n==Spanish response==\nThe response of the Spanish King [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]] was swift. There was little fear that Portugal's old ally [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] would come to their aid, as it was fully occupied by the [[American War of Independence|American Revolutionary War]].\n\nKing Charles III promoted Governor [[Pedro Antonio de Cevallos]] to [[Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata|Viceroy of the R\u00edo de la Plata]] and gave him the leadership of the expedition. Cevallos had already proven his ability in the First Cevallos expedition (1762\u20131763), when he had conquered Colonia del Sacramento and had marched deep into Portuguese territory.\n\nCevallos was in Spain and organized personally the expedition from [[Cadiz]]. He had 9,000 men, and a fleet of six [[warship]]s (''Poderoso'', 70 [[Naval artillery|gun]]s, ''Santiago la Am\u00e9rica'', 64, ''San D\u00e1maso'', 70,  ''Septentri\u00f3n'', 70, ''Monarca'', 70,  and ''San Jos\u00e9'', 70), six [[frigate]]s, a number of smaller ships and a hundred transport ships at his disposal. The commander of the fleet was Francisco Javier Everardo Tilly y Garc\u00eda de Paredes, marqu\u00e9s de Casa Tilly. The fleet left Cadiz on 20 November and arrived in [[South America]] on 18 February 1777, capturing several Portuguese ships on the way .\n\n\nThere they encountered the Portuguese fleet of Robert MacDouall, which was much smaller and managed to escape.\n\nCevallos decided to attack the island of [[Santa Catarina (island)|Santa Catarina]] on 23 February. When the Portuguese saw the formidable Spanish fleet disembark their troops, the [[garrison]] fled to the mainland without firing a shot. On 20 March, Cevallos sailed towards his second target, Rio Grande de S\u00e3o Pedro, but the fleet was dispersed by a storm and had to return to [[Montevideo]].\n\nThere he split up his forces. He sailed himself with all the [[artillery]] to Colonia de Sacramento, where he started the siege on 23 May. The city capitulated on 3 June.\n\nThe rest of the fleet was sent to check the fleet of MacDouall, which was still a menace to be counted with. In fact this fleet surprised and captured the lone ''San Agust\u00edn'', and renamed the ship ''Santo Agostinho''. The new captain, who also played an important role in capturing the ship was an [[English people|Englishman]] in Portuguese service, [[Arthur Phillip]] who later founded [[Port Jackson]] ([[Sydney]]).\n  \nAfter the capture of Sacramento, Cevallos marched his troops towards Rio Grande de S\u00e3o Pedro, joined forces with the troops of Juan Jos\u00e9 Vertiz which were concentrated in Santa Teresa. Then he was ordered to stop his advance, as peace negotiations were started.\n\n==Peace==\nOn 24 February 1777 King [[Joseph I of Portugal|Joseph I]] died and his daughter and successor [[Maria I of Portugal|Maria I]] dismissed [[Sebasti\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquis of Pombal|Pombal]] and concluded on 1 October the [[First Treaty of San Ildefonso]] with Spain.\n\nSpain returned the island of Santa Catarina to Portugal and recognized Rio Grande de S\u00e3o Pedro as Portuguese territory, but kept Colonia del Sacramento, which the Portuguese had founded in 1680,<ref>Robert S. Chamberlain, \"Latin America\", in ''An Encyclopedia of History'' (1948), Revised Edition, Boston:  Houghton Mifflin, p. 501.</ref>, with the rest of the [[Banda Oriental]] ([[Uruguay]]), and also kept the [[Misiones Orientales]].  In return, Spain acknowledged that the Portuguese territories in Brazil extended far west of the line that had been set in the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]].<ref>Robert S. Chamberlain, \"Latin America\", in ''An Encyclopedia of History'' (1948), Revised Edition, Boston:  Houghton Mifflin, p. 502.</ref>  \n\nIn the [[Treaty of El Pardo (1778)|Treaty of El Pardo]], signed on 11 March 1778, Spain won [[Spanish Guinea]]<ref>\"Spanish Guinea\", in ''The Columbia-Viking Desk Encyclopedia'' (1953), New York:  Viking.</ref> ([[Equatorial Guinea]]), which would be administered from [[Buenos Aires]] from 1778 to 1810.\n\n==Aftermath==\nOne of the results of the war was that the Portuguese remained neutral when the [[American War of Independence]] became a global war in 1778 with the entry of the [[French people|French]]. The Portuguese were bound to the [[British people|British]] by treaty but disappointed by the lack of British support against Spain, Portugal did not itself enter the war.

The first [[Cab over|cab-over engine]] (COE) truck produced with a tilting cab by Ford, the C-series replaced the C-series COE variant of the F-series, produced since 1948.  Produced as both a straight/rigid truck and a tractor, a wide range of versions of C-series was produced, ranging from Class 5 to Class 8 [[Gross vehicle weight rating|GVWR]] ratings.  The C-series was also used as a basis for [[Firefighting apparatus|fire apparatus]] production.  \n\nProduced for 33 years nearly unchanged (with the exception of its powertrain), the C-series was the longest-produced commercial truck in North America at the time of its withdrawal; only the [[Mack R series|Mack Model R]] (39 years) and [[Kenworth W900]] (59 years; still in production) have remained in production longer. In 1986, Ford began phasing in the Ford Cargo in North America, serving as its replacement after the 1990 model year.   \n\n==C series COE (1948-1956)==\n[[File:Ford C600 COE.jpg|thumb|left|\"Helmet-shaped\" COE (1955 Ford C-600)]]\nLike other automotive manufacturers that built COE trucks before the 1960s, early Ford C-series trucks were \"helmet-shaped\", cab-forward trucks that shared components with pickup trucks (the F series, in this case). From 1948-52, they were simply COE versions of the F-5, F-6, F-7, and F-8.  For 1953, they were redesignated the C series, but largely remained modified F-series trucks.\n\nModels consisted of the C-500, C-600, C-700, C-750, C-800, C-850 and C-900. Like the F-900, the C-900 also included a \"Big Job\" model.  Diesel-engined trucks included an extra zero in the model designations (i.e. C-8000 or C-9000).\n{{-}}\n\n==Design history==\n[[File:1973 Ford C-900-1-.JPG|thumb|alt=Decommissioned 1973 Ford C-900 fire truck, for sale at a restaurant in [[Land O' Lakes, Florida]] - the truck was sold at some point.|1973 Ford C-900 fire truck]]\n[[File:Huachuca City Fire - 2010-03-16 - 04.jpg|thumb|Ford C-series fire truck in action in 2010]]\nAs Ford started squaring off its vehicles in 1957, they finally gave the cab-overs their own designs separate from the rest of the Ford truck lineup.  It featured a small grille near the front bumper, with a four-pointed star emblem on each end,  the word \"F O R D\" spelled out below the windshield, and had a cog-and-lightning bolt crest emblem between the headlights. Variations of this emblem were found on many other Ford trucks during the 1950s and into the 1960s. The C series held onto this logo the longest.\n\n===Design updates===\nIn a fashion similar to the [[Checker Marathon]] or [[Volkswagen Beetle]], changes to the C-series trucks throughout its production were very subtle.  If anywhere, many of these changes were identifiable by the changes in the cowl insignias and badging.  Between 1958 and 1960, the C series used a quad-headlight fascia. This was helpful for fire departments, which wanted to use the extra headlight bezels for emergency flashers, an option that was offered exclusively to fire, and other emergency vehicles after 1960.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.pnwspaamfaa.com/images/App_pictures/Fire_32/F32_new_lg.jpg |title=1964 Ford C-1000/Wesco Fire Engine(SPAAMFAA: Pacific Northwest Chapter) |access-date=2008-05-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528134545/http://www.pnwspaamfaa.com/images/App_pictures/Fire_32/F32_new_lg.jpg |archive-date=2008-05-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  In 1961, Ford reverted to the single headlight design; the regular C-series cab closely resembled the 1957 version.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1960-1969-ford-trucks2.htm|title=1961 Ford Trucks|publisher=HowStuffWorks|accessdate=2010-03-09}}</ref> A new [[Ford Super Duty Engine|Super Duty]] model was added.  Another option included a small sleeper cab.\n\n====1963-1990====\nFor 1963, the C series was updated with the same cowl insignias used by the rest of the medium- and heavy-duty truck line up. The logo had the word FORD on top of a trapezoid with the model number designation. This insignia was used until 1967.<ref>[American Truck & Bus Spotter's Guide: 1920-1985, by Tad Burness.]</ref><ref>[Ford Trucks Since 1905, by James K. Wagner.]</ref> Also in 1963, Ford introduced diesel versions of the C series, as well as the N series and heavy-duty [[Ford F-Series|F series]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1960-1969-ford-trucks4.htm|title=1963 Ford Trucks|publisher=HowStuffWorks|accessdate=2010-03-09}}</ref>\n\n[[File:1986 Ford 800 diesel.jpg|thumb|left|1986 Ford C-800 Diesel]]\nIn 1968, federal regulations required all automotive manufacturers to add side marker reflectors or lights, which Ford was able to add to the new cowl insignia used on the F series since 1967. That same year, Ford decided to add this insignia on the doors of the C series, as well. Unlike the Ford F series, which removed them for 1973, the C series would retain them until the end of production in 1990.  After 1972, the Canadian Mercury version of the C series was discontinued, becoming the last Mercury truck until the 1993 Mercury Villager.\n\nThe year 1974 was the last for the cog-and-lightning bolt crest that graced the front of the C series trucks from the beginning, and other Ford trucks since the 1950s.  In the 1980s, Ford began adding its blue oval logo to all models; it was added to the C series in 1984.\n\nIn 1981, the [[Ford Cargo]] was introduced by [[Ford of Britain]] as its largest truck line.  For 1986, Ford began sales of the Cargo in North America, sourcing production from [[Ford Brasil]].  While the Cargo was largely intended to replace the C-Series, the popularity of the C-Series in niche applications led to both model lines marketed concurrently through the end of the 1980s.    \n\nAfter 33 model years with only minor changes, the final C-Series trucks were built in 1990.  In 1997, importation of the Cargo came to an end, as Ford sold the rights to the model line (alongside that of the Ford Louisville/Aeromax) to [[Freightliner Trucks|Freightliner]].\n{{-}}\n\n==Powertrain==\n\n;Gasoline engines <ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.curbsideclassic.com/curbside-classics-american/curbside-classic-the-almost-immortal-ford-c-series/ | title=Curbside Classic: The Almost Immortal Ford C-Series | accessdate=30 September 2013}}</ref>\n*Ford {{convert|300|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Ford straight-six engine#300|300]] inline-6\n*Ford 401, 477 & 534 [[Ford Super Duty engine|Super Duty]] V8\n*Ford 292 & 292HD Y block (1957-1963)\n*Ford 330MD/HD, 359XD, 361 & 389XD, 391 cubic inch [[Ford FE engine|FT]] V8 (1964-1978)\n*Lincoln 302 and 332 cubic inch Y-Block V8 (1957-1963)\n*Ford [[Ford 385 engine|370 and 429]] cubic inch commercial engines (1979-1990)\n\nFrom the 1957 through 1963  model years, the higher rated (C-750 / 800 / 900) Ford C series had the [[Lincoln Y-block V8 engine]] as optional or standard equipment.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\n;Diesel engines<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.curbsideclassic.com/curbside-classics-american/curbside-classic-the-almost-immortal-ford-c-series/ | title=Curbside Classic: The Almost Immortal Ford C-Series | accessdate=30 September 2013}}</ref>\n*[[Caterpillar Inc.|Caterpillar]] 1160/3208 V8\n*[[Cummins]] N Series inline-6\n*Cummins C8.3 inline-6\n*Ford 6.6L & 7.8L inline-6\n*[[Detroit Diesel|Detroit]] 8.2L \"Fuel Pincher\" V8\n{{-}}\n\n==Ford H series (1961\u20131966)==\nIn 1961, Ford introduced a variant of the C series in order to move into the Class 8 COE market.  Named the H series, this version placed the cab much higher on the chassis; instead of being placed underneath the drivers' seat, the front axle was moved forward, directly underneath the driver.  With the higher placement of the cab, space was available for a larger grille, shared with the N-series conventional trucks.  The cab cutouts for the C-series front wheels were turned into underfloor toolboxes and luggage space.  With the stacked appearance of the H series, it soon earned the nickname \"Two Story Falcon\".<ref>[http://sourkrautsmodeltrucks.com/?page_id=3&category=2&product_id=323 Ford H Model (2 Story Falcon) Cab Over (Sour Kraut's Model Truck Parts)]</ref><ref>[http://www.hankstruckpictures.com/keith_cantone.htm Keith Cantone Collection (Hank's Truck Pictures)]</ref>  HD-series trucks, with Cummins N-series diesels, were the first Ford [[diesel fuel|diesel]] trucks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1960-1969-ford-trucks3.htm|title=1962 Ford Trucks|publisher=HowStuffWorks|accessdate=2010-03-09}}</ref>\n\nThe \"Two Story Falcon\" lasted until 1966, when it was replaced by the W-series COE trucks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1960-1969-ford-trucks7.htm|title=1966 Ford Trucks|publisher=HowStuffWorks|accessdate=2010-03-09}}</ref>\n\n==Usage by other manufacturers==\nSome historians have erroneously referred to the Ford tilt-cab as the \"Budd\" cab, implying it was an off-the-shelf item available to anyone.  However, the C-series cab was designed by Ford, tooled at its own expense and built by the Budd Company to Ford Motor Company specifications.  Other truck manufacturers had to obtain Ford approval before purchasing it.  The exception was [[Mack Trucks|Mack]], which bought most of the major cab stampings from Budd and assembled them itself on a floor pan of its own design. In Canada, the Ford \"C\" had an identical twin - the Mercury \"M\" Series offered from 1957 to 1972.\n\nAt least four truck makers used the Ford C-series tilt cab. Best known was the look-alike Mack model \"N\", which was produced between 1958 and 1962. The Four-Wheel-Drive Auto Company used some Ford \"C\" cabs which bore the FWD emblems, and Yankee-Walter used C-series cab components on some of its large airport crash trucks. In Canada, the Thibault fire truck manufacturer of Pierreville, Quebec, also used C-series parts for their Custom (i.e. non-commercial chassis) trucks.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Resources ==\n*American Truck & Bus Spotter's Guide: 1920-1985, by Tad Burness.\n*Ford Trucks Since 1905, by James K.

The first [[Cab over|cab-over engine]] (COE) truck produced with a tilting cab by Ford, the C-series replaced the C-series COE variant of the F-series, produced since 1948.  Produced as both a straight/rigid truck and a tractor, a wide range of versions of C-series was produced, ranging from Class 5 to Class 8 GVWR ratings.  The C-series was also used as a basis for [[Firefighting apparatus|fire apparatus]] production.  \n\nProduced for 33 years nearly unchanged (with the exception of its powertrain), the C-series was the longest-produced commercial truck in North America at the time of its withdrawal; only the [[Mack R series|Mack Model R]] (39 years) and [[Kenworth W900]] (59 years; still in production) have remained in production longer. In 1986, Ford began phasing in the Ford Cargo in North America, serving as its replacement after the 1990 model year.   \n\n==C series COE (1948-1956)==\n[[File:Ford C600 COE.jpg|thumb|left|\"Helmet-shaped\" COE (1955 Ford C-600)]]\nLike other automotive manufacturers that built COE trucks before the 1960s, early Ford C-series trucks were \"helmet-shaped\", cab-forward trucks that shared components with pickup trucks (the F series, in this case). From 1948-52, they were simply COE versions of the F-5, F-6, F-7, and F-8.  For 1953, they were redesignated the C series, but largely remained modified F-series trucks.\n\nModels consisted of the C-500, C-600, C-700, C-750, C-800, C-850 and C-900. Like the F-900, the C-900 also included a \"Big Job\" model.  Diesel-engined trucks included an extra zero in the model designations (i.e. C-8000 or C-9000).\n{{-}}\n\n==Design history==\n[[File:1973 Ford C-900-1-.JPG|thumb|alt=Decommissioned 1973 Ford C-900 fire truck, for sale at a restaurant in [[Land O' Lakes, Florida]] - the truck was sold at some point.|1973 Ford C-900 fire truck]]\n[[File:Huachuca City Fire - 2010-03-16 - 04.jpg|thumb|Ford C-series fire truck in action in 2010]]\nAs Ford started squaring off its vehicles in 1957, they finally gave the cab-overs their own designs separate from the rest of the Ford truck lineup.  It featured a small grille near the front bumper, with a four-pointed star emblem on each end,  the word \"F O R D\" spelled out below the windshield, and had a cog-and-lightning bolt crest emblem between the headlights. Variations of this emblem were found on many other Ford trucks during the 1950s and into the 1960s. The C series held onto this logo the longest.\n\n===Design updates===\nIn a fashion similar to the [[Checker Marathon]] or [[Volkswagen Beetle]], changes to the C-series trucks throughout its production were very subtle.  If anywhere, many of these changes were identifiable by the changes in the cowl insignias and badging.  Between 1958 and 1960, the C series used a quad-headlight fascia. This was helpful for fire departments, which wanted to use the extra headlight bezels for emergency flashers, an option that was offered exclusively to fire, and other emergency vehicles after 1960.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.pnwspaamfaa.com/images/App_pictures/Fire_32/F32_new_lg.jpg |title=1964 Ford C-1000/Wesco Fire Engine(SPAAMFAA: Pacific Northwest Chapter) |access-date=2008-05-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528134545/http://www.pnwspaamfaa.com/images/App_pictures/Fire_32/F32_new_lg.jpg |archive-date=2008-05-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  In 1961, Ford reverted to the single headlight design; the regular C-series cab closely resembled the 1957 version.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1960-1969-ford-trucks2.htm|title=1961 Ford Trucks|publisher=HowStuffWorks|accessdate=2010-03-09}}</ref> A new [[Ford Super Duty Engine|Super Duty]] model was added.  Another option included a small sleeper cab.\n\n====1963-1990====\nFor 1963, the C series was updated with the same cowl insignias used by the rest of the medium- and heavy-duty truck line up. The logo had the word FORD on top of a trapezoid with the model number designation. This insignia was used until 1967.<ref>[American Truck & Bus Spotter's Guide: 1920-1985, by Tad Burness.]</ref><ref>[Ford Trucks Since 1905, by James K. Wagner.]</ref> Also in 1963, Ford introduced diesel versions of the C series, as well as the N series and heavy-duty [[Ford F-Series|F series]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1960-1969-ford-trucks4.htm|title=1963 Ford Trucks|publisher=HowStuffWorks|accessdate=2010-03-09}}</ref>\n\n[[File:1986 Ford 800 diesel.jpg|thumb|left|1986 Ford C-800 Diesel]]\nIn 1968, federal regulations required all automotive manufacturers to add side marker reflectors or lights, which Ford was able to add to the new cowl insignia used on the F series since 1967. That same year, Ford decided to add this insignia on the doors of the C series, as well. Unlike the Ford F series, which removed them for 1973, the C series would retain them until the end of production in 1990.  After 1972, the Canadian Mercury version of the C series was discontinued, becoming the last Mercury truck until the 1993 Mercury Villager.\n\nThe year 1974 was the last for the cog-and-lightning bolt crest that graced the front of the C series trucks from the beginning, and other Ford trucks since the 1950s.  In the 1980s, Ford began adding its blue oval logo to all models; it was added to the C series in 1984.\n\nIn 1981, the [[Ford Cargo]] was introduced by [[Ford of Britain]] as its largest truck line.  For 1986, Ford began sales of the Cargo in North America, sourcing production from [[Ford Brasil]].  While the Cargo was largely intended to replace the C-Series, the popularity of the C-Series in niche applications led to both model lines marketed concurrently through the end of the 1980s.    \n\nAfter 33 model years with only minor changes, the final C-Series trucks were built in 1990.  In 1997, importation of the Cargo came to an end, as Ford sold the rights to the model line (alongside that of the Ford Louisville/Aeromax) to [[Freightliner Trucks|Freightliner]].\n{{-}}\n\n==Powertrain==\n\n;Gasoline engines <ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.curbsideclassic.com/curbside-classics-american/curbside-classic-the-almost-immortal-ford-c-series/ | title=Curbside Classic: The Almost Immortal Ford C-Series | accessdate=30 September 2013}}</ref>\n*Ford {{convert|300|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Ford straight-six engine#300|300]] inline-6\n*Ford 401, 477 & 534 [[Ford Super Duty engine|Super Duty]] V8\n*Ford 292 & 292HD Y block (1957-1963)\n*Ford 330MD/HD, 359XD, 361 & 389XD, 391 cubic inch [[Ford FE engine|FT]] V8 (1964-1978)\n*Lincoln 302 and 332 cubic inch Y-Block V8 (1957-1963)\n*Ford [[Ford 385 engine|370 and 429]] cubic inch commercial engines (1979-1990)\n\nFrom the 1957 through 1963  model years, the higher rated (C-750 / 800 / 900) Ford C series had the [[Lincoln Y-block V8 engine]] as optional or standard equipment.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\n;Diesel engines<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.curbsideclassic.com/curbside-classics-american/curbside-classic-the-almost-immortal-ford-c-series/ | title=Curbside Classic: The Almost Immortal Ford C-Series | accessdate=30 September 2013}}</ref>\n*[[Caterpillar Inc.|Caterpillar]] 1160/3208 V8\n*[[Cummins]] N Series inline-6\n*Cummins C8.3 inline-6\n*Ford 6.6L & 7.8L inline-6\n*[[Detroit Diesel|Detroit]] 8.2L \"Fuel Pincher\" V8\n{{-}}\n\n==Ford H series (1961\u20131966)==\nIn 1961, Ford introduced a variant of the C series in order to move into the Class 8 COE market.  Named the H series, this version placed the cab much higher on the chassis; instead of being placed underneath the drivers' seat, the front axle was moved forward, directly underneath the driver.  With the higher placement of the cab, space was available for a larger grille, shared with the N-series conventional trucks.  The cab cutouts for the C-series front wheels were turned into underfloor toolboxes and luggage space.  With the stacked appearance of the H series, it soon earned the nickname \"Two Story Falcon\".<ref>[http://sourkrautsmodeltrucks.com/?page_id=3&category=2&product_id=323 Ford H Model (2 Story Falcon) Cab Over (Sour Kraut's Model Truck Parts)]</ref><ref>[http://www.hankstruckpictures.com/keith_cantone.htm Keith Cantone Collection (Hank's Truck Pictures)]</ref>  HD-series trucks, with Cummins N-series diesels, were the first Ford [[diesel fuel|diesel]] trucks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1960-1969-ford-trucks3.htm|title=1962 Ford Trucks|publisher=HowStuffWorks|accessdate=2010-03-09}}</ref>\n\nThe \"Two Story Falcon\" lasted until 1966, when it was replaced by the W-series COE trucks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1960-1969-ford-trucks7.htm|title=1966 Ford Trucks|publisher=HowStuffWorks|accessdate=2010-03-09}}</ref>\n\n==Usage by other manufacturers==\nSome historians have erroneously referred to the Ford tilt-cab as the \"Budd\" cab, implying it was an off-the-shelf item available to anyone.  However, the C-series cab was designed by Ford, tooled at its own expense and built by the Budd Company to Ford Motor Company specifications.  Other truck manufacturers had to obtain Ford approval before purchasing it.  The exception was [[Mack Trucks|Mack]], which bought most of the major cab stampings from Budd and assembled them itself on a floor pan of its own design. In Canada, the Ford \"C\" had an identical twin - the Mercury \"M\" Series offered from 1957 to 1972.\n\nAt least four truck makers used the Ford C-series tilt cab. Best known was the look-alike Mack model \"N\", which was produced between 1958 and 1962. The Four-Wheel-Drive Auto Company used some Ford \"C\" cabs which bore the FWD emblems, and Yankee-Walter used C-series cab components on some of its large airport crash trucks. In Canada, the Thibault fire truck manufacturer of Pierreville, Quebec, also used C-series parts for their Custom (i.e. non-commercial chassis) trucks.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Resources ==\n*American Truck & Bus Spotter's Guide: 1920-1985, by Tad Burness.\n*Ford Trucks Since 1905, by James K.

[[Samuel Carter (Coventry MP)|Samuel Carter]], solicitor to both LNWR and the [[Midland Railway]], managed the [[conveyancing]]. It was built in the centre of Birmingham, replacing several earlier rail termini on the outskirts of the centre, most notably [[Birmingham Curzon Street railway station (1838-1966)|Curzon Street]], which had opened in 1838, and was no longer adequate for the level of traffic.<ref name=\"Nstr18541967\"/>\n\nUntil 1885 the LNWR shared the station with the Midland. However, in 1885 the Midland Railway opened its own extension alongside the original station for the exclusive use of its trains, effectively creating two stations side-by-side. The two companies stations were separated by a central roadway; Queens Drive.<ref name=\"Nstr18541967\"/> Traffic grew steadily, and by 1900 New Street had an average of 40 trains an hour departing and arriving, rising to 53 trains in the peak hours.<ref>{{cite web|title=www.warwickshirerailways.com - lnwrbns_str1295c|url=http://www.warwickshirerailways.com/lms/lnwrbns_str1295c.htm|publisher=www.warwickshirerailways.com|accessdate=28 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Original-new-street.jpg|thumb|left|Early 20th century photo taken from the west, showing the LNWR station (left) and the Midland station (right) with the Queens Drive between them]]\n\n==== Original LNWR station====\n[[File:Birmingham New Street station in 1854.jpg|thumb|Birmingham New Street station as pictured in the ''[[Illustrated London News]]'' on 3 June 1854]]\nThe LNWR had obtained an Act of Parliament in 1846, to extend their line into the centre of Birmingham, which involved the acquisition of some {{convert|1.2|ha|0}} of land, and the demolition of around 70 houses in Peck Lane, The Froggery, Queen Street, and Colmore Street.<ref>''Aris's Birmingham Gazette'', 16 February 1850.</ref>  The [[Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion]] chapel, on the corner of Peck Lane and Dudley Street, which had only been built six years before,<ref>It had been opened Tuesday 16 May 1843.

Outside Birmingham, in [[Solihull]], is {{rws|Birmingham International}}, which serves [[Birmingham Airport]] and the [[National Exhibition Centre]].\n===Railway operations===\nNew Street is the hub of the West Midlands rail network, as well as being a major national hub. The station is one of seventeen operated and managed by Network Rail.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.networkrail.co.uk/browse%20documents/eNRT/May13/Commercial_Information.pdf |title=Commercial information |date=May 2013 |work=Complete National Rail Timetable |publisher=Network Rail |location=London |page=43 |accessdate=5 June 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904231906/http://www.networkrail.co.uk/browse%20documents/eNRT/May13/Commercial_Information.pdf |archive-date=4 September 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Network Rail also provides operational staff for the station.\n\nStation staff are provided on all platforms to assist with the safe 'dispatch' of trains. For operational reasons all trains departing New Street much be dispatched via the use of [[UK railway signalling|Right Away (RA)]] indicators. RA indicators display a signal informing the train driver it is safe to start the train, instead of using more traditional bell or hand signals.\n\nThe 12 through platforms are divided into ''a'' and ''b'' ends, with an extra bay platform called 4c between 4b and 5b, with the ''b'' end of the station towards Wolverhampton, this in effect allows twice the platforms. Longer trains that are too long for one section of the platform occupy the entire length of the platform, such as [[British Rail Class 390|Class 390]] or [[InterCity 125|HSTs]].\n\nTrains departing towards Proof House Junction (''a'' end) can depart from any platform, but there are restrictions on trains departing from the ''b'' end. All platforms can accommodate trains heading towards Wolverhampton, however due the platform layout and road bridge supports, only 5\u201312 can accommodate trains heading towards Five Ways. There are a number of sidings on the station for the stabling of trains; between platforms 5/6, 7/8, 9/10. The bay platforms at either end of platform 12 have been removed during the current{{when|date=June 2016}} rebuild. The sidings in front of New Street signal box have also been removed.\n\nAll signalling is controlled by New Street power signal box at the Wolverhampton or ''b'' end of the station; it can be seen at street level on Navigation Street. The station is allocated the [[IATA location identifier]] [http://www.theairdb.com/airport/QQN.html QQN].\n\n====Approach tunnels====\nAll trains arriving and departing must use one of the several tunnels around the station.<ref name=\"Nstr18541967\"/><ref>{{cite book |title=Railway Track Diagrams 4: Midlands & North West |editor-last=Bridge |editor-first=Mike |isbn=978-0-9549866-7-4 |oclc=880581044 |last1=Yonge |first1=John |last2=Padgett |first2=David |last3=Szwenk |first3=John |edition=3rd |date=August 2013 |origyear=1990 |publisher=Trackmaps |location=Bradford on Avon |at=map 16 |ref=harv }}</ref>\n\n*Stour Valley Line Tunnel \u2013 heads westwards towards Soho Junction & Wolverhampton, and passes under the [[National Indoor Arena]]. This tunnel is {{convert|927|yard|m}} long in total, comprising the original New Street North Tunnel, {{convert|751|yard|m}} and extension: 'Arena' Tunnel, {{convert|176|yard|m}}. The former was opened in 1852 as part of the [[Stour Valley Line]], and holds two tracks.\n*New Street South Tunnel \u2013 {{convert|254|yard|m}} long, heading eastbound, passing under the [[Bull Ring Shopping Centre|Bullring]], and {{rws|Birmingham Moor Street}} station, heading towards [[Duddeston railway station|Duddeston]], [[Adderley Park railway station|Adderley Park]], the [[Camp Hill Line]] and the [[Cross Country Route|Derby lines]] towards [[Tamworth railway station|Tamworth]]. This tunnel opened in 1854, originally holding two tracks; it was widened in 1896 to hold four tracks, with two double-track parallel bores.\n*Gloucester Line Tunnels \u2013 are four separate tunnels heading south-west towards [[Five Ways railway station|Five Ways]]. Heading from New Street in sequence the tunnels are named Holliday Street Tunnel, {{convert|307|yard|m}} long; Canal Tunnel, {{convert|225|yard|m}} long, passing under the [[Birmingham Canal Navigations]]; Granville Street Tunnel, {{convert|81|yard|m}} long; and Bath Row Tunnel, {{convert|210|yard|m}} long. These tunnels opened in 1885 as part of the [[Birmingham West Suburban Railway]] and hold two tracks.\n\n===Customer service and ticketing===\nNetwork Rail, as well as operating the station, operate a customer reception located on the main concourse, and provide mobility assistance and train dispatch. The booking office and barriers are operated by [[Avanti West Coast]], with customer service or floor walker staff provided by CrossCountry and Network Rail. Avanti West Coast operates a first class lounge and [[Transport for West Midlands|Network West Midlands]] also provides a public transport information point for the station.\n\nThe station is a [[penalty fare]] station for [[West Midlands Railway]] and [[London Northwestern Railway]] (West Midlands Trains' [[brand|brands]]). This scheme is operated both onboard trains and at the automatic ticket barriers at the station. The other train operating companies that use the station do not operate penalty fare schemes.\n\n===Pollution and air quality concerns===\nThe station is designated as underground. There are fans that remove fumes but there are still a large number of services operated by diesel trains despite the whole station being electrified in the 1960s. There have been environmental concerns about the level of pollution in the station in particular NOx.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/uk-england-birmingham-45061470?ns_mchannel=social&ns_source=twitter&ns_campaign=bbc_live&ns_linkname=5b6b2a13a081040678934c1c%26%27More%20improvements%27%20needed%20to%20cut%20station%20air%20pollution%26&ns_fee=0#post_5b6b2a13a081040678934c1c|title=BBC item regarding New Street Pollution|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===Train operating companies===\nSince the [[privatisation of British Rail]] there have been thirteen [[train operating company|train companies]] that have regularly called at New Street: \n[[Arriva Trains Wales]], [[Avanti West Coast]], [[Central Trains]], [[CrossCountry]], [[First North Western]], [[London Midland]], [[Silverlink]], [[Virgin CrossCountry]], [[Virgin Trains West Coast]], [[Transport for Wales Rail|Transport for Wales]], [[Wales & Borders]], [[Wales & West]] and [[West Midlands Trains]].\n\nCurrently Avanti West Coast, CrossCountry, Transport for Wales and West Midlands Trains provide services from New Street. [[Chiltern Railways]] have occasionally used New Street during engineering works.\n\nWest Midlands Trains operates a traincrew depot at the station and stables some trains overnight around the station. For the most part, they use [[Soho TMD]] for electric traction units, with its non-electric units kept at [[Tyseley TMD]] to the southeast of Birmingham.\n\nCrossCountry also operates a traincrew depot at the station; it uses Tyseley TMD for the [[British Rail Class 170|Class 170]] units, and its Voyagers are based at [[Central Rivers TMD]].\n\n==Train services==\n[[File:Birmingham & West Mids Passenger Railway Map.JPG|thumb|Map of passenger railways in the Birmingham & West Midlands area]]\nThe basic Monday to Saturday off-peak service in trains per hour (tph) is as follows:\n\n[[Avanti West Coast]]\n* 3tph to [[Euston railway station|London Euston]] (1 via Rugby, 1 via Watford Junction and 1 via Milton Keynes Central).

The collision caused the guards van of the Derby train to [[telescoping (railway)|telescope]] with the rear coach. Three people were killed, and twenty four injured.

Outside Birmingham, in [[Solihull]], is {{rws|Birmingham International}}, which serves [[Birmingham Airport]] and the [[National Exhibition Centre]].\n===Railway operations===\nNew Street is the hub of the West Midlands rail network, as well as being a major national hub. The station is one of seventeen operated and managed by Network Rail.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.networkrail.co.uk/browse%20documents/eNRT/May13/Commercial_Information.pdf |title=Commercial information |date=May 2013 |work=Complete National Rail Timetable |publisher=Network Rail |location=London |page=43 |accessdate=5 June 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904231906/http://www.networkrail.co.uk/browse%20documents/eNRT/May13/Commercial_Information.pdf |archive-date=4 September 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Network Rail also provides operational staff for the station.\n\nStation staff are provided on all platforms to assist with the safe 'dispatch' of trains. For operational reasons all trains departing New Street much be dispatched via the use of [[UK railway signalling|Right Away (RA)]] indicators. RA indicators display a signal informing the train driver it is safe to start the train, instead of using more traditional bell or hand signals.\n\nThe 12 through platforms are divided into ''a'' and ''b'' ends, with an extra bay platform called 4c between 4b and 5b, with the ''b'' end of the station towards Wolverhampton, this in effect allows twice the platforms. Longer trains that are too long for one section of the platform occupy the entire length of the platform, such as [[British Rail Class 390|Class 390]] or [[InterCity 125|HSTs]].\n\nTrains departing towards Proof House Junction (''a'' end) can depart from any platform, but there are restrictions on trains departing from the ''b'' end. All platforms can accommodate trains heading towards Wolverhampton, however due the platform layout and road bridge supports, only 5\u201312 can accommodate trains heading towards Five Ways. There are a number of sidings on the station for the stabling of trains; between platforms 5/6, 7/8, 9/10. The bay platforms at either end of platform 12 have been removed during the current{{when|date=June 2016}} rebuild. The sidings in front of New Street signal box have also been removed.\n\nAll signalling is controlled by New Street power signal box at the Wolverhampton or ''b'' end of the station; it can be seen at street level on Navigation Street. The station is allocated the [[IATA location identifier]] [http://www.theairdb.com/airport/QQN.html QQN].\n\n====Approach tunnels====\nAll trains arriving and departing must use one of the several tunnels around the station.<ref name=\"Nstr18541967\"/><ref>{{cite book |title=Railway Track Diagrams 4: Midlands & North West |editor-last=Bridge |editor-first=Mike |isbn=978-0-9549866-7-4 |oclc=880581044 |last1=Yonge |first1=John |last2=Padgett |first2=David |last3=Szwenk |first3=John |edition=3rd |date=August 2013 |origyear=1990 |publisher=Trackmaps |location=Bradford on Avon |at=map 16 |ref=harv }}</ref>\n\n*Stour Valley Line Tunnel \u2013 heads westwards towards Soho Junction & Wolverhampton, and passes under the [[National Indoor Arena]]. This tunnel is {{convert|927|yard|m}} long in total, comprising the original New Street North Tunnel, {{convert|751|yard|m}} and extension: 'Arena' Tunnel, {{convert|176|yard|m}}. The former was opened in 1852 as part of the [[Stour Valley Line]], and holds two tracks.\n*New Street South Tunnel \u2013 {{convert|254|yard|m}} long, heading eastbound, passing under the [[Bull Ring Shopping Centre|Bullring]], and {{rws|Birmingham Moor Street}} station, heading towards [[Duddeston railway station|Duddeston]], [[Adderley Park railway station|Adderley Park]], the [[Camp Hill Line]] and the [[Cross Country Route|Derby lines]] towards [[Tamworth railway station|Tamworth]]. This tunnel opened in 1854, originally holding two tracks; it was widened in 1896 to hold four tracks, with two double-track parallel bores.\n*Gloucester Line Tunnels \u2013 are four separate tunnels heading south-west towards [[Five Ways railway station|Five Ways]]. Heading from New Street in sequence the tunnels are named Holliday Street Tunnel, {{convert|307|yard|m}} long; Canal Tunnel, {{convert|225|yard|m}} long, passing under the [[Birmingham Canal Navigations]]; Granville Street Tunnel, {{convert|81|yard|m}} long; and Bath Row Tunnel, {{convert|210|yard|m}} long. These tunnels opened in 1885 as part of the [[Birmingham West Suburban Railway]] and hold two tracks.\n\n===Customer service and ticketing===\nNetwork Rail, as well as operating the station, operate a customer reception located on the main concourse, and provide mobility assistance and train dispatch. The booking office and barriers are operated by [[Avanti West Coast]], with customer service or floor walker staff provided by CrossCountry and Network Rail. Avanti West Coast operates a first class lounge and [[Transport for West Midlands|Network West Midlands]] also provides a public transport information point for the station.\n\nThe station is a [[penalty fare]] station for [[West Midlands Railway]] and [[London Northwestern Railway]] (West Midlands Trains' [[brand|brands]]). This scheme is operated both onboard trains and at the automatic ticket barriers at the station. The other train operating companies that use the station do not operate penalty fare schemes.\n\n===Pollution and air quality concerns===\nThe station is designated as underground. There are fans that remove fumes but there are still a large number of services operated by diesel trains despite the whole station being electrified in the 1960s. There have been environmental concerns about the level of pollution in the station in particular NOx.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/uk-england-birmingham-45061470?ns_mchannel=social&ns_source=twitter&ns_campaign=bbc_live&ns_linkname=5b6b2a13a081040678934c1c%26%27More%20improvements%27%20needed%20to%20cut%20station%20air%20pollution%26&ns_fee=0#post_5b6b2a13a081040678934c1c|title=BBC item regarding New Street Pollution|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===Train operating companies===\nSince the [[privatisation of British Rail]] there have been thirteen [[train operating company|train companies]] that have regularly called at New Street: \n[[Arriva Trains Wales]], [[Avanti West Coast]], [[Central Trains]], [[CrossCountry]], [[First North Western]], [[London Midland]], [[Silverlink]], [[Virgin CrossCountry]], [[Virgin Trains West Coast]], [[Transport for Wales Rail|Transport for Wales]], [[Wales & Borders]], [[Wales & West]] and [[West Midlands Trains]].\n\nCurrently Avanti West Coast, CrossCountry, Transport for Wales and West Midlands Trains provide services from New Street. [[Chiltern Railways]] have occasionally used New Street during engineering works.\n\nWest Midlands Trains operates a traincrew depot at the station and stables some trains overnight around the station. For the most part, they use [[Soho TMD]] for electric traction units, with its non-electric units kept at [[Tyseley TMD]] to the southeast of Birmingham.\n\nCrossCountry also operates a traincrew depot at the station; it uses Tyseley TMD for the [[British Rail Class 170|Class 170]] units, and its Voyagers are based at [[Central Rivers TMD]].\n\n==Train services==\n[[File:Birmingham & West Mids Passenger Railway Map.JPG|thumb|Map of passenger railways in the Birmingham & West Midlands area]]\nThe basic Monday to Saturday off-peak service in trains per hour (tph) is as follows:\n\n[[Avanti West Coast]]\n* 3tph to [[Euston railway station|London Euston]] (1 via Rugby, 1 via Watford Junction and 1 via Milton Keynes Central).
