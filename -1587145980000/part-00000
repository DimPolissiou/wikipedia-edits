{"title_page": "Political parties in the United States", "text_new": "{{For|a complete list|List of political parties in the United States}}\n{{short description|Political parties in the United States}}\n{{Politics of the United States}}\n<!-- Note to editors: This article presents the historical development and role of political parties in United States politics and outlines more extensively the significant modern parties. -->\n\n'''Political parties in the United States''' are dominated by two major parties. Since the 1850s, they have been the [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] and the [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]]. This [[two-party system]] is based on laws, party rules and custom. Various small minor parties come and go and occasionally win major offices at the state level. Local offices, however, are often nonpartisan.you guys are annoying\n\n== Overview ==\nThe need to win popular support in a [[Republicanism in the United States|republic]] led to the American invention of voter-based political parties in the 1790s.<ref>{{cite book |author=Roy Franklin Nichols|title=The invention of the American political parties|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=34g0AAAAIAAJ|year=1967|publisher=Macmillan}}</ref> Americans were especially innovative in devising new campaign techniques that linked public opinion with public policy through the party.<ref>Robert J. Dinkin,  ''Campaigning in America: A History of Election Practices.'' [https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&d=14291969 (Greenwood 1989) online version]</ref>\n\nPolitical scientists and historians have divided the development of America's two-party system into five eras.<ref>Paul Kleppner, et al. ''The Evolution of American Electoral Systems'' (1983),</ref> The first two-party system consisted of the [[Federalist Party]], who supported the ratification of the Constitution, and the [[Democratic-Republican Party]] or the [[Anti-Administration party]] (Anti-Federalists), who opposed the powerful central government, among others, that the Constitution established when it took effect in 1789.<ref>{{cite web | title=The First Political Parties: Federalists and Anti-Federalists | work=Boundless Political Science | publisher=Boundless.com | date=May 26, 2016 | accessdate=July 27, 2016 | url=https://www.boundless.com/political-science/textbooks/boundless-political-science-textbook/interest-groups-7/the-history-of-political-parties-55/the-first-political-parties-federalists-and-anti-federalists-316-1572/ }}</ref>\n\nThe modern two-party system consists of the [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and the [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. Several [[Third party (United States)|third parties]] also operate in the U.S., and from time to time elect someone to local office.<ref>William B. Hesseltine, ''Third-Party Movements in the United States'' (1962)</ref> The largest third party since the 1980s has been the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]].\n\nBesides the [[Constitution Party (United States)|Constitution]], [[Green Party of the United States|Green]], and Libertarian parties, there are [[List of political parties in the United States|many other political parties]] that receive only minimal support and only appear on the ballot in one or a few states.\n\nSome political candidates, and many voters, choose not to identify with a particular political party. In some states, [[Independent voter#In the United States|independents]] are not allowed to vote in primary elections, but in others, they can vote in any primary election of their choice. Although the term \"independent\" often is used as a synonym for \"moderate,\" \"centrist,\" or \"swing voter,\" to refer to a politician or voter who holds views that incorporate facets of both liberal and conservative ideologies, most self-described independents consistently support one of the two major parties when it comes time to vote, according to [[Vox Media]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2016/1/22/10814522/independents-voters-facts-myths|title=9 media myths about independent voters, debunked|last=Klar|first=Samara|date=2016-01-22|website=Vox|access-date=2019-03-07}}</ref>\n\n== History and early political parties ==\n[[File:PartyVotes-Presidents.png|thumb|right|400px|Popular votes to political parties during presidential elections.]]\n[[File:Political Parties Derivation in the United States.svg|thumb|400px|Political parties derivation. Dotted line means unofficially.]]\n\nThe [[United States Constitution]] is silent on the subject of political parties. The [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] did not originally intend for American politics to be partisan. In [[Federalist No. 9|Federalist Papers No. 9]] and [[Federalist No. 10|No. 10]], [[Alexander Hamilton]] and [[James Madison]], respectively, wrote specifically about the dangers of domestic [[political faction]]s. In addition, the first [[President of the United States]], [[George Washington]], was not a member of any political party at the time of his election or throughout his tenure as president. Furthermore, he hoped that political parties would not be formed, fearing conflict and stagnation, as outlined in his [[George Washington's Farewell Address|Farewell Address]].<ref>{{cite WS|title=Washington's Farewell Address|link=Washington's Farewell Address#20}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, the beginnings of the American [[two-party system]] emerged from his immediate circle of advisers. Hamilton and Madison, who wrote the aforementioned Federalist Papers against political factions, ended up being the core leaders in this emerging party system. It was the split camps of Federalists, given rise with Hamilton as a leader, and Democratic-Republicans, with Madison and [[Thomas Jefferson]]  at the helm of this political faction, that created the environment in which partisanship, once distasteful, came to being.<ref>Richard Hofstadter, ''The Idea of a Party System: The Rise of Legitimate Opposition in the United States, 1780\u20131840'' (1970)</ref><ref>Gordon S. Wood, ''Empire of Liberty: A History of the Early Republic, 1789\u20131815 (Oxford History of the United States)''</ref>\n\n=== First Party System: 1792\u20131824 ===\n{{Main|First Party System}}\nThe First Party System of the United States featured the [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalist Party]] and the [[Democratic-Republican Party (United States)|Democratic-Republican Party]] (also called \"Jeffersonian Republican\"). The Federalist Party grew from the national network of Washington's Secretary of the Treasury, [[Alexander Hamilton]], who favored a strong united central government, close ties to Britain, a centralized banking system, and close links between the government and men of wealth.\n\nThe Democratic-Republican Party was founded by Madison and Thomas Jefferson, who strongly opposed Hamilton's agenda.<ref>William Nisbet Chambers, ed. ''The First Party System'' (1972)</ref> The [[Jeffersonian democracy|Jeffersonians]] came to power in 1800 and the Federalists were too elitist to compete effectively. The Federalists survived in the Northeast, but their refusal to support the [[War of 1812]] verged on secession and was a devastating blow when the war ended well. The [[Era of Good Feelings]] under [[James Monroe|President James Monroe]] (1816\u20131824) marked the end of the First Party System and a brief period in which partisanship was minimal.<ref>George Dangerfield, ''The Era of Good Feelings'' (1952)</ref>\n\n=== Second Party System: 1828\u20131854 ===\n{{Main|Second Party System}}\n\nThe Second Party System operated from about 1828 to 1854, following the splintering of the Democratic-Republican Party. Two major parties dominated the political landscape: the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]], led by [[Henry Clay]], that grew from the [[National Republican Party (United States)|National Republican Party]];  and the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], led by [[Andrew Jackson]]. The Democrats supported the primacy of the Presidency over the other branches of government, and opposed both the [[Second Bank of the United States|Bank of the United States]] as well as modernizing programs that they felt would build up [[industry]] at the expense of the [[taxpayer]].\n\nThe Whigs, on the other hand, advocated the primacy of [[United States Congress|Congress]] over the [[Executive (government)|executive branch]] as well as policies of modernization and economic protectionism. Central political battles of this era were the [[Bank War]] and the [[Spoils system]] of federal patronage.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 3123555|title = Politics and Society: Toward a Jacksonian Synthesis|journal = Journal of the Early Republic|volume = 10|issue = 2|pages = 135\u2013161|last1 = Feller|first1 = Daniel|year = 1990|doi = 10.2307/3123555}}</ref> The 1850s saw the collapse of the Whig party, largely as a result of decline in its leadership and a major intra-party split over slavery as a result of the [[Kansas-Nebraska Act]]. In addition, the fading of old economic issues removed many of the unifying forces holding the party together.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"right\" style=\"margin-left:1em; text-align:center\"\n|+ [[List of United States presidential elections by popular vote margin|Presidential election victories]] by party system<ref>Using the definitions of: First Party System: 1796\u20131824, Second Party System: 1828\u20131852, Third Party System: 1856\u20131892, Fourth Party System: 1896\u20131928, Fifth Party System: 1932\u20131964, Sixth Party System: 1968\u2013present</ref>\n|-\n!

The [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] was in large part the opposition party during this period, although it often controlled the Senate or the House of Representatives, or both.\n\n[[American Civil War|Civil war]] and [[Reconstruction Era of the United States|Reconstruction]] issues polarized the parties until the [[Compromise of 1877]], which ended the latter. Thus both parties became broad-based voting coalitions and the race issue pulled newly enfranchised African Americans ([[Freedmen]]) into the Republican Party while white southerners ([[Redeemers]]) joined the Democratic Party. The Democratic coalition also had conservative pro-business [[Bourbon Democrats]], traditional Democrats in the North (many of them former [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperheads]]), and Catholic immigrants, among others. The Republican coalition also consisted of businessmen, shop owners, skilled craftsmen, clerks, and professionals who were attracted to the party's modernization policies.<ref>Paul Kleppner; Paul. ''The Third Electoral System 1853\u20131892: Parties, Voters, and Political Cultures'' (1979), [https://www.questia.com/library/book/the-third-electoral-system-1853-1892-parties-voters-and-political-cultures-by-paul-kleppner.jsp online edition]</ref>\n\n=== Fourth Party System: 1896\u20131932 ===\n{{Main|Fourth Party System}}\nThe Fourth Party System, 1896 to 1932, consisted of the same interest groups as the Third Party System, but saw major shifts in the central issues of debate. This period also corresponded to the [[Progressive Era]], and was dominated by the Republican Party. It began after the Republicans blamed the Democrats for the [[Panic of 1893]], which later resulted in [[William McKinley]]'s victory over [[William Jennings Bryan]] in the [[1896 United States presidential election|1896 presidential election]].\n\nThe central domestic issues changed to government regulation of railroads and large corporations (\"[[Trust (monopoly)|trusts]]\"), the protective tariff, the role of [[Trade union|labor unions]], [[child labor]], the need for a new banking system, corruption in party politics, primary elections, direct election of senators, [[racial segregation]], efficiency in government, [[women's suffrage]], and control of immigration. Most voting blocs continued unchanged, but some realignment took place, giving Republicans dominance in the industrial Northeast and new strength in the border states. Historians have long debated why no [[Labor Party of the United States|Labor Party]] emerged in the United States, in contrast to Western Europe.<ref>Robin Archer, ''Why Is There No Labor Party in the United States?'' (Princeton University Press, 2007)</ref>\n\n=== Fifth and Sixth Party Systems since 1933 ===\n{{Main|Fifth Party System|Sixth Party System}}\nThe Fifth Party System emerged with the [[New Deal Coalition]] beginning in 1933.<ref>Richard Jensen, \"The Last Party System: Decay of Consensus, 1932\u20131980,\" in Paul Kleppner et al., ''The Evolution of American Electoral Systems (Greenwood, 1981), pp. 205\u201306.</ref> The Republicans began losing support after the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], giving rise to Democratic President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and the activist [[New Deal]]. They promoted American liberalism, anchored in a coalition of specific liberal groups, especially [[Ethnoreligious group|ethno-religious]] constituencies (Catholics, Jews, African Americans), white Southerners, well-organized labor unions, urban machines, progressive intellectuals, and populist farm groups.\n\nOpposition Republicans were split between a conservative wing, led by [[Ohio]] Senator [[Robert A. Taft]], and a more successful moderate wing exemplified by the politics of Northeastern leaders such as [[Nelson Rockefeller]], [[Jacob Javits]], and [[Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.|Henry Cabot Lodge]]. The latter steadily lost influence inside the GOP after 1964.<ref>Nicol C.

From its founding until the mid-20th century, the Democratic Party was the dominant party among white southerners, and as such, was then the party most associated with the defense of slavery. However, following the [[Great Society]] under [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], the Democratic Party became the more progressive party on issues of civil rights, while losing dominance in the Southern states to the Republicans.\n\nThe Democratic Party since 1912 has positioned itself as the liberal party on domestic issues. The economic philosophy of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], which has strongly influenced [[Modern liberalism in the United States|modern American liberalism]], has shaped much of the party's agenda since 1932. Roosevelt's [[New Deal coalition]] controlled the White House until 1968, with the exception of the two terms of [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|President Eisenhower]] from 1953\u20131961. Since the mid-20th century, Democrats have generally been in the [[center-left]] and currently support [[social justice]], [[social liberalism]], a [[mixed economy]], and the [[welfare state]], although [[Bill Clinton]] and other [[New Democrats]] have pushed for [[free trade]] and [[neoliberalism]], which is seen to have shifted the party rightwards. Democrats are currently strongest in the [[Northeast of the United States|Northeast]] and [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] and in major American urban centers.  African-Americans and Latinos tend to be disproportionately Democratic, as do [[trade union]]s.\n\nIn 2004, it was the largest political party, with 72 million registered voters (42.6% of 169 million registered) claiming affiliation.<ref name=\"Neuhart20040122\">{{cite news\n|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/columnist/neuharth/2004-01-22-neuharth_x.htm\n|last=Neuhart|first=Al|title=Why politics is fun from catbirds' seats|work=USA Today|accessdate=2007-07-11 | date=January 22, 2004}}</ref> Although his party lost the election for president in 2004, [[Barack Obama]] would later go on to become president in 2009 and continue to be the president until January 2017.

Since the 1880s it has been nicknamed (by the media) the \"Grand Old Party\"  or GOP, although it is younger than the Democratic Party.\n\nFounded in 1854 by Northern anti-slavery activists and modernizers, the Republican Party rose to prominence in 1860 with the election of [[Abraham Lincoln]], who used the party machinery to support victory in the [[American Civil War]]. The GOP dominated national politics during the [[Third Party System]], from 1854 to 1896, and the [[Fourth Party System]] from 1896 to 1932.\n\nSince its founding, the Republican Party has been the more market-oriented of the two American political parties, often favoring policies that aid American business interests.  As a party whose power was once based on the voting power of Union Army veterans, this party has traditionally supported more aggressive defense measures and more lavish veterans' benefits. Today, the Republican Party supports an [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservative]] platform, with further foundations in [[economic liberalism]], [[fiscal conservatism]], and [[social conservatism]].  The Republican Party tends to be strongest in the [[Southern United States]] and the \"[[flyover states]]\", as well as suburban and rural areas in other states.  One significant base of support for the Republican Party is [[Evangelical Christian]]s, who have wielded significant power in the party since the early 1970s.\n\n[[President of the United States|President]] [[Donald Trump]] is the 18th and the current Republican to be elected to the office of [[President of the United States]]. Since the [[United States elections, 2010|2010 midterm elections]], the Republicans held a majority in the United States House of Representatives until the 2018 midterms where they lost it to the Democratic Party.  Additionally, since the 2014 elections, the Republican Party has controlled the Senate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/president|title=2016 Election News, Candidates & Polls|publisher=}}</ref> In 2018, the Republican party had roughly 55 million registered members, making it the second largest party in the United States.\n\n== Minor parties ==\nThe United States also has an array of minor parties, the largest of which (on the basis of support for their Presidential candidates in the 2016 election), are the Libertarian, Green, and Constitution parties.\n{{Main|List of political parties in the United States}}\n\n=== Libertarian Party ===\n{{Main|Libertarian Party (United States)}}\nThe Libertarian Party was founded on December 11, 1971.<ref>[http://www.lp.org/organization/history.shtml Libertarian Party:Our History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060130133301/http://www.lp.org/organization/history.shtml |date=2006-01-30 }}, LP.org</ref> It is the largest continuing [[third party (United States)|third party]] in the United States, claiming well over 500,000 registered voters across all 50 states.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ballot-access.org/2017/07/27/new-registration-data-for-the-united-states/|title=New Voter Registration Nation Totals|first=Richard|last=Winger|date=27 July 2017|work=ballot-access.org|accessdate=27 July 2017}}</ref> As of 2019, they have about 176 elected officials, including 1 state legislator.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lp.org/elected-officials/|title=Elected Officials|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe 2012 Libertarian Party nominee for United States President was former New Mexico governor, [[Gary Johnson]].

In [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]], Johnson ran again, receiving over four million votes, or 3.3% of the popular vote.\n\nThe Libertarian Party's core mission is to reduce the size, influence, and expenditures of all levels of government. To this effect, the party supports minimally regulated markets, a less powerful [[federal government]], strong [[civil liberties]], [[drug liberalization]], [[separation of church and state]], [[open immigration]], [[non-interventionism]] and [[neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]] in diplomatic relations, [[free trade]] and [[freedom of movement|free movement]] to all foreign countries, and a more representative republic.<ref name=LPOption>{{cite web|title=The Libertarian Option|url=http://www.lp.org/introduction/the-libertarian-option|website=The Libertarian Party|publisher=Libertarian National Committee, Inc.|accessdate=5 July 2014}}</ref> As of 2016, it is the third largest organized political party in the United States.\n\n=== Green Party ===\n{{Main|Green Party of the United States}}\nIn the [[United States]], the Green Party has been active as a [[third party (United States)|third party]] since the 1980s.

As of 2016, it is the fourth largest organized political party in the United States.\n\n=== Constitution Party ===\n{{Main|Constitution Party (United States)}}\n{{refimprove-section|date=February 2020}}\nThe Constitution Party is a small national conservative political party in the United States. It was founded as the U.S. Taxpayers Party in 1992 by Howard Phillips. The party's official name was changed to the \"Constitution Party\" in 1999; however, some state affiliate parties are known under different names.\n\nThe Constitution Party is strongly pro-life (i.e. opposed to [[abortion]]), and supports [[Gun politics in the United States|gun rights]], and restrictions on immigration. It calls for protectionist trade policies.\n\nIn 2006, [[Rick Jore]] of [[Montana]] became the first Constitution Party candidate elected to a state-level office,<ref>[http://sos.mt.gov/ELB/archives/2006/elections/general/house/hd12/index.asp \"State Legislature results\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116040533/http://sos.mt.gov/ELB/archives/2006/elections/general/house/hd12/index.asp |date=2006-11-16 }}, ''Missoulian'', November 8, 2006, retrieved November 8, 2006</ref><ref>[http://www.helenair.com/articles/2006/11/09/montana/a01110906_02.txt Control of state Legislature unclear], ''Helena Independent Record''</ref> though the Constitution Party of Montana had disaffiliated itself from the national party a short time before the election.\n\nIn 2010 former Congressman [[Tom Tancredo]] was the Constitution Party candidate for governor of [[Colorado]], coming in second with 617,030 votes, 36.4% and ahead of the Republican candidate, Dan Maes, with 11.1%.\n\nThe Constitution Party's 2012 presidential nominee was former Congressman [[Virgil Goode]] of Virginia.\n\nTennessee Attorney [[Darrell Castle]] was the 2016 Constitution Party nominee for President of the United States and Scott Bradley of Utah was the nominee for Vice President.\n\n== Issues ==\n{{See also|Left\u2013right politics#Contemporary usage in the United States|label 1=Usage of \"left\u2013right\" politics in the United States|Politics of the United States#Organization of American political parties|label 2=Organization of American political parties}}\n\nBecause American political parties are more loosely organized than those in other countries, not all members of a party subscribe to all of the officially held positions in their respective [[party platform|party's platform]]. The usual degree of variation generally is higher for the larger parties. Party members may hold different views on legislation to be enacted at the state or federal levels, and an elected official once in office may act contradictory to many of his or her party's positions (this has led to terms such as \"[[Republican In Name Only]]\" and \"[[Democrat In Name Only]]\" \u2013 RINO and DINO, respectively). Furthermore, the modern American [[political spectrum]], and the usage of [[left\u2013right politics]], differs from the rest of the world. For example, the Democratic Party, the primary left-of-center party in the country, generally supports a [[social liberal]] position rather than a [[social democratic]] one, though there are exceptions.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Critchlow, Donald T.

In some states, [[Independent voter#In the United States|independents]] are not allowed to vote in primary elections, but in others, they can vote in any primary election of their choice. Although the term \"independent\" often is used as a synonym for \"moderate,\" \"centrist,\" or \"swing voter,\" to refer to a politician or voter who holds views that incorporate facets of both liberal and conservative ideologies, most self-described independents consistently support one of the two major parties when it comes time to vote, according to [[Vox Media]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2016/1/22/10814522/independents-voters-facts-myths|title=9 media myths about independent voters, debunked|last=Klar|first=Samara|date=2016-01-22|website=Vox|access-date=2019-03-07}}</ref>\n\n== History and early political parties ==\n[[File:PartyVotes-Presidents.png|thumb|right|400px|Popular votes to political parties during presidential elections.]]\n[[File:Political Parties Derivation in the United States.svg|thumb|400px|Political parties derivation. Dotted line means unofficially.]]\n\nThe [[United States Constitution]] is silent on the subject of political parties. The [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] did not originally intend for American politics to be partisan. In [[Federalist No. 9|Federalist Papers No. 9]] and [[Federalist No. 10|No. 10]], [[Alexander Hamilton]] and [[James Madison]], respectively, wrote specifically about the dangers of domestic [[political faction]]s. In addition, the first [[President of the United States]], [[George Washington]], was not a member of any political party at the time of his election or throughout his tenure as president. Furthermore, he hoped that political parties would not be formed, fearing conflict and stagnation, as outlined in his [[George Washington's Farewell Address|Farewell Address]].<ref>{{cite WS|title=Washington's Farewell Address|link=Washington's Farewell Address#20}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, the beginnings of the American [[two-party system]] emerged from his immediate circle of advisers. Hamilton and Madison, who wrote the aforementioned Federalist Papers against political factions, ended up being the core leaders in this emerging party system. It was the split camps of Federalists, given rise with Hamilton as a leader, and Democratic-Republicans, with Madison and [[Thomas Jefferson]]  at the helm of this political faction, that created the environment in which partisanship, once distasteful, came to being.<ref>Richard Hofstadter, ''The Idea of a Party System: The Rise of Legitimate Opposition in the United States, 1780\u20131840'' (1970)</ref><ref>Gordon S.

The Federalist Party grew from the national network of Washington's Secretary of the Treasury, [[Alexander Hamilton]], who favored a strong united central government, close ties to Britain, a centralized banking system, and close links between the government and men of wealth.\n\nThe Democratic-Republican Party was founded by Madison and Thomas Jefferson, who strongly opposed Hamilton's agenda.<ref>William Nisbet Chambers, ed. ''The First Party System'' (1972)</ref> The [[Jeffersonian democracy|Jeffersonians]] came to power in 1800 and the Federalists were too elitist to compete effectively. The Federalists survived in the Northeast, but their refusal to support the [[War of 1812]] verged on secession and was a devastating blow when the war ended well. The [[Era of Good Feelings]] under [[James Monroe|President James Monroe]] (1816\u20131824) marked the end of the First Party System and a brief period in which partisanship was minimal.<ref>George Dangerfield, ''The Era of Good Feelings'' (1952)</ref>\n\n=== Second Party System: 1828\u20131854 ===\n{{Main|Second Party System}}\n\nThe Second Party System operated from about 1828 to 1854, following the splintering of the Democratic-Republican Party. Two major parties dominated the political landscape: the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]], led by [[Henry Clay]], that grew from the [[National Republican Party (United States)|National Republican Party]];  and the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], led by [[Andrew Jackson]]. The Democrats supported the primacy of the Presidency over the other branches of government, and opposed both the [[Second Bank of the United States|Bank of the United States]] as well as modernizing programs that they felt would build up [[industry]] at the expense of the [[taxpayer]].\n\nThe Whigs, on the other hand, advocated the primacy of [[United States Congress|Congress]] over the [[Executive (government)|executive branch]] as well as policies of modernization and economic protectionism.

The [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] was in large part the opposition party during this period, although it often controlled the Senate or the House of Representatives, or both.\n\n[[American Civil War|Civil war]] and [[Reconstruction Era of the United States|Reconstruction]] issues polarized the parties until the [[Compromise of 1877]], which ended the latter. Thus both parties became broad-based voting coalitions and the race issue pulled newly enfranchised African Americans ([[Freedmen]]) into the Republican Party while white southerners ([[Redeemers]]) joined the Democratic Party. The Democratic coalition also had conservative pro-business [[Bourbon Democrats]], traditional Democrats in the North (many of them former [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperheads]]), and Catholic immigrants, among others. The Republican coalition also consisted of businessmen, shop owners, skilled craftsmen, clerks, and professionals who were attracted to the party's modernization policies.<ref>Paul Kleppner; Paul.

This period also corresponded to the [[Progressive Era]], and was dominated by the Republican Party. It began after the Republicans blamed the Democrats for the [[Panic of 1893]], which later resulted in [[William McKinley]]'s victory over [[William Jennings Bryan]] in the [[1896 United States presidential election|1896 presidential election]].\n\nThe central domestic issues changed to government regulation of railroads and large corporations (\"[[Trust (monopoly)|trusts]]\"), the protective tariff, the role of [[Trade union|labor unions]], [[child labor]], the need for a new banking system, corruption in party politics, primary elections, direct election of senators, [[racial segregation]], efficiency in government, [[women's suffrage]], and control of immigration. Most voting blocs continued unchanged, but some realignment took place, giving Republicans dominance in the industrial Northeast and new strength in the border states. Historians have long debated why no [[Labor Party of the United States|Labor Party]] emerged in the United States, in contrast to Western Europe.<ref>Robin Archer, ''Why Is There No Labor Party in the United States?''

They promoted American liberalism, anchored in a coalition of specific liberal groups, especially [[Ethnoreligious group|ethno-religious]] constituencies (Catholics, Jews, African Americans), white Southerners, well-organized labor unions, urban machines, progressive intellectuals, and populist farm groups.\n\nOpposition Republicans were split between a conservative wing, led by [[Ohio]] Senator [[Robert A. Taft]], and a more successful moderate wing exemplified by the politics of Northeastern leaders such as [[Nelson Rockefeller]], [[Jacob Javits]], and [[Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.|Henry Cabot Lodge]]. The latter steadily lost influence inside the GOP after 1964.<ref>Nicol C. Rae, ''The Decline and Fall of the Liberal Republicans: From 1952 to the Present'' (1989)</ref>\n\nExperts debate whether this era ended (and a [[Sixth Party System]] subsequently emerged) in the mid-1960s when the New Deal coalition died, the early 1980s when the [[Moral Majority]] and the [[Reagan coalition]] were formed, the early 1990s when [[Third Way]] emerged among Democrats, the mid-1990s during the [[Republican Revolution]], or if the Fifth system continues in some form to the present.\n\nSince the 1930s, the Democrats positioned themselves more towards [[Liberalism in the United States|liberalism]] while [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]] increasingly dominated the GOP.<ref>[[Matthew Levendusky]], ''The Partisan Sort: How Liberals Became Democrats and Conservatives Became Republicans'' (U Chicago Press, 2009)</ref> However, new voter coalitions emerged during the latter half of the 20th century, with conservatives and the Republicans becoming dominant in the South, rural areas, and suburbs; while liberals and the Democrats increasingly started to rely on a coalition of African-Americans, Hispanics and white urban progressives.\n\n=== Minor parties and independents ===\n{{See also|Independent politician#United States}}\nAlthough American politics have been dominated by the two-party system, several other political parties have also emerged throughout the country's history. The oldest third party was the [[Anti-Masonic Party]], which was formed in upstate New York in 1828. The party's creators feared the [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]], believing they were a powerful secret society that was attempting to rule the country in defiance of republican principles.<ref>Morris, Richard B.

From its founding until the mid-20th century, the Democratic Party was the dominant party among white southerners, and as such, was then the party most associated with the defense of slavery. However, following the [[Great Society]] under [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], the Democratic Party became the more progressive party on issues of civil rights, while losing dominance in the Southern states to the Republicans.\n\nThe Democratic Party since 1912 has positioned itself as the liberal party on domestic issues. The economic philosophy of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], which has strongly influenced [[Modern liberalism in the United States|modern American liberalism]], has shaped much of the party's agenda since 1932. Roosevelt's [[New Deal coalition]] controlled the White House until 1968, with the exception of the two terms of [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|President Eisenhower]] from 1953\u20131961. Since the mid-20th century, Democrats have generally been in the [[center-left]] and currently support [[social justice]], [[social liberalism]], a [[mixed economy]], and the [[welfare state]], although [[Bill Clinton]] and other [[New Democrats]] have pushed for [[free trade]] and [[neoliberalism]], which is seen to have shifted the party rightwards. Democrats are currently strongest in the [[Northeast of the United States|Northeast]] and [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] and in major American urban centers.  African-Americans and Latinos tend to be disproportionately Democratic, as do [[trade union]]s.\n\nIn 2004, it was the largest political party, with 72 million registered voters (42.6% of 169 million registered) claiming affiliation.<ref name=\"Neuhart20040122\">{{cite news\n|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/columnist/neuharth/2004-01-22-neuharth_x.htm\n|last=Neuhart|first=Al|title=Why politics is fun from catbirds' seats|work=USA Today|accessdate=2007-07-11 | date=January 22, 2004}}</ref> Although his party lost the election for president in 2004, [[Barack Obama]] would later go on to become president in 2009 and continue to be the president until January 2017.  Obama was the 15th Democrat to hold the office, and from the [[United States general elections, 2006|2006 midterm elections]] until the [[United States elections, 2014|2014 midterm elections]], the Democratic Party was also the [[Two-party system|majority party]] in the [[United States Senate]].\n\nA 2011 ''[[USA Today]]'' review of state voter rolls indicates that the number of registered Democrats declined in 25 of 28 states (some states do not register voters by party). During this time, Republican registration also declined, as independent or no preference voting was on the rise.  But in 2011 Democrats numbers shrank 800,000, and from 2008 they were down by 1.7 million, or 3.9%.<ref name=\"Wolf\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/story/2011-12-22/voters-political-parties/52171688/1|title=Voters leaving Republican, Democratic parties in droves|author=Wolf, Richard|first=|date=December 22, 2011|work=USA Today|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=June 20, 2012}}</ref> In 2018, the Democratic party was the largest in the United States with roughly 60 Million registered members.\n\n=== Republican Party ===\n{{Main|Republican Party (United States)|History of the United States Republican Party}}\nThe Republican Party is one of the two major contemporary political parties in the United States of America. Since the 1880s it has been nicknamed (by the media) the \"Grand Old Party\"  or GOP, although it is younger than the Democratic Party.\n\nFounded in 1854 by Northern anti-slavery activists and modernizers, the Republican Party rose to prominence in 1860 with the election of [[Abraham Lincoln]], who used the party machinery to support victory in the [[American Civil War]]. The GOP dominated national politics during the [[Third Party System]], from 1854 to 1896, and the [[Fourth Party System]] from 1896 to 1932.\n\nSince its founding, the Republican Party has been the more market-oriented of the two American political parties, often favoring policies that aid American business interests.  As a party whose power was once based on the voting power of Union Army veterans, this party has traditionally supported more aggressive defense measures and more lavish veterans' benefits. Today, the Republican Party supports an [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservative]] platform, with further foundations in [[economic liberalism]], [[fiscal conservatism]], and [[social conservatism]].  The Republican Party tends to be strongest in the [[Southern United States]] and the \"[[flyover states]]\", as well as suburban and rural areas in other states.  One significant base of support for the Republican Party is [[Evangelical Christian]]s, who have wielded significant power in the party since the early 1970s.\n\n[[President of the United States|President]] [[Donald Trump]] is the 18th and the current Republican to be elected to the office of [[President of the United States]]. Since the [[United States elections, 2010|2010 midterm elections]], the Republicans held a majority in the United States House of Representatives until the 2018 midterms where they lost it to the Democratic Party.  Additionally, since the 2014 elections, the Republican Party has controlled the Senate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/president|title=2016 Election News, Candidates & Polls|publisher=}}</ref> In 2018, the Republican party had roughly 55 million registered members, making it the second largest party in the United States.\n\n== Minor parties ==\nThe United States also has an array of minor parties, the largest of which (on the basis of support for their Presidential candidates in the 2016 election), are the Libertarian, Green, and Constitution parties.\n{{Main|List of political parties in the United States}}\n\n=== Libertarian Party ===\n{{Main|Libertarian Party (United States)}}\nThe Libertarian Party was founded on December 11, 1971.<ref>[http://www.lp.org/organization/history.shtml Libertarian Party:Our History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060130133301/http://www.lp.org/organization/history.shtml |date=2006-01-30 }}, LP.org</ref> It is the largest continuing [[third party (United States)|third party]] in the United States, claiming well over 500,000 registered voters across all 50 states.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ballot-access.org/2017/07/27/new-registration-data-for-the-united-states/|title=New Voter Registration Nation Totals|first=Richard|last=Winger|date=27 July 2017|work=ballot-access.org|accessdate=27 July 2017}}</ref> As of 2019, they have about 176 elected officials, including 1 state legislator.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lp.org/elected-officials/|title=Elected Officials|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe 2012 Libertarian Party nominee for United States President was former New Mexico governor, [[Gary Johnson]].

In [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]], Johnson ran again, receiving over four million votes, or 3.3% of the popular vote.\n\nThe Libertarian Party's core mission is to reduce the size, influence, and expenditures of all levels of government. To this effect, the party supports minimally regulated markets, a less powerful [[federal government]], strong [[civil liberties]], [[drug liberalization]], [[separation of church and state]], [[open immigration]], [[non-interventionism]] and [[neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]] in diplomatic relations, [[free trade]] and [[freedom of movement|free movement]] to all foreign countries, and a more representative republic.<ref name=LPOption>{{cite web|title=The Libertarian Option|url=http://www.lp.org/introduction/the-libertarian-option|website=The Libertarian Party|publisher=Libertarian National Committee, Inc.|accessdate=5 July 2014}}</ref> As of 2016, it is the third largest organized political party in the United States.\n\n=== Green Party ===\n{{Main|Green Party of the United States}}\nIn the [[United States]], the Green Party has been active as a [[third party (United States)|third party]] since the 1980s.

It was founded as the U.S. Taxpayers Party in 1992 by Howard Phillips. The party's official name was changed to the \"Constitution Party\" in 1999; however, some state affiliate parties are known under different names.\n\nThe Constitution Party is strongly pro-life (i.e. opposed to [[abortion]]), and supports [[Gun politics in the United States|gun rights]], and restrictions on immigration. It calls for protectionist trade policies.\n\nIn 2006, [[Rick Jore]] of [[Montana]] became the first Constitution Party candidate elected to a state-level office,<ref>[http://sos.mt.gov/ELB/archives/2006/elections/general/house/hd12/index.asp \"State Legislature results\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116040533/http://sos.mt.gov/ELB/archives/2006/elections/general/house/hd12/index.asp |date=2006-11-16 }}, ''Missoulian'', November 8, 2006, retrieved November 8, 2006</ref><ref>[http://www.helenair.com/articles/2006/11/09/montana/a01110906_02.txt Control of state Legislature unclear], ''Helena Independent Record''</ref> though the Constitution Party of Montana had disaffiliated itself from the national party a short time before the election.\n\nIn 2010 former Congressman [[Tom Tancredo]] was the Constitution Party candidate for governor of [[Colorado]], coming in second with 617,030 votes, 36.4% and ahead of the Republican candidate, Dan Maes, with 11.1%.\n\nThe Constitution Party's 2012 presidential nominee was former Congressman [[Virgil Goode]] of Virginia.\n\nTennessee Attorney [[Darrell Castle]] was the 2016 Constitution Party nominee for President of the United States and Scott Bradley of Utah was the nominee for Vice President.\n\n== Issues ==\n{{See also|Left\u2013right politics#Contemporary usage in the United States|label 1=Usage of \"left\u2013right\" politics in the United States|Politics of the United States#Organization of American political parties|label 2=Organization of American political parties}}\n\nBecause American political parties are more loosely organized than those in other countries, not all members of a party subscribe to all of the officially held positions in their respective [[party platform|party's platform]]. The usual degree of variation generally is higher for the larger parties. Party members may hold different views on legislation to be enacted at the state or federal levels, and an elected official once in office may act contradictory to many of his or her party's positions (this has led to terms such as \"[[Republican In Name Only]]\" and \"[[Democrat In Name Only]]\" \u2013 RINO and DINO, respectively). Furthermore, the modern American [[political spectrum]], and the usage of [[left\u2013right politics]], differs from the rest of the world. For example, the Democratic Party, the primary left-of-center party in the country, generally supports a [[social liberal]] position rather than a [[social democratic]] one, though there are exceptions.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Critchlow, Donald T.
