As engineered by [[Alec Issigonis]], the compact arrangement located the transmission and engine sharing a single oil sump &mdash; despite disparate lubricating requirements &mdash; and had the engine's radiator mounted to the side of the engine, away from the flow of fresh air and drawing heated rather than cool air over the engine. The layout often required the engine be removed to service the clutch.<ref name=\"dante1\">{{cite web |title=Dante Giacosa |website=Fiat 500 USA |url=http://www.fiat500usa.com/2009/02/dante-giacosa.html}}</ref>\n\nAs engineered by [[Dante Giacosa]], the 128 featured a transverse-mounted [[engine]] with unequal length drive shafts and an innovative clutch release mechanism &mdash; an arrangement which Fiat had strategically tested on a previous production model for a full five years, the [[Autobianchi Primula|Primula]] from its less market-critical subsidiary, [[Autobianchi]].<ref name=\"AU71.9\">[[#AU71|Becker]], p. 79</ref> The layout enabled the engine and gearbox to be located side by side without sharing lubricating fluid while orienting an electrically controlled cooling fan toward fresh air flow. By using the Primula as a test-bed, Fiat was able to sufficiently resolve the layout's disadvantages, including uneven side-to-side power transmission, uneven tire wear and potential [[torque steer]], the tendency for the power of the engine alone to steer the car under heavy acceleration.\n\nThe compact and efficient layout &mdash; a transversely-mounted engine with transmission mounted beside the engine driving the front wheels through an offset final-drive and unequal-length driveshafts &mdash; subsequently became common with competitors<ref name=\"lampredi\" /> and arguably an industry standard.<ref name=\"octane\">{{cite web |title=1969-1984 FIAT 128 Saloon |publisher=Classic and Performance Car |quote=It\u2019s the recipe for technical orthodoxy that has since been adopted by the entire industry. |url=http://www.classicandperformancecar.com/front_website/octane_interact/carspecs.php/?see=3994 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408211929/http://www.classicandperformancecar.com/front_website/octane_interact/carspecs.php/?see=3994 |archivedate=2014-04-08 }}</ref>\n\nThe layout was sufficiently flexible that Fiat reconfigured the 128 drive-train as a mid-engined layout for the [[Fiat X1/9]].\n\n==Design==\nThe all new 1.1 litre [[Fiat SOHC]] engine, engineered by noted engine designer [[Aurelio Lampredi]], featured an iron block mated to an aluminum head along with a belt-driven single overhead camshaft producing 49&nbsp;hp.<ref name=\"lampredi\">{{cite web |title=Collectible Classic: 1971-1979 Fiat 128 |publisher=Automobile Magazine, August 2012 |url=http://www.automobilemag.com/features/collectible_classic/1208_collectible_classic_1971_1979_fiat_128/}}</ref>\n\nThe 128 was styled similarly to the 124 and 125 and featured rack-and-pinion steering, front disc brakes, independent rear suspension with a transverse leaf spring, and a strut-type front suspension with integral anti-roll bar.<ref name=\"lampredi\" />\n\n[[File:Fiat 128-Mk2 Front-view.JPG|thumb|left|Second series (1976) Fiat 128 with new rectangular headlights]]\nInitially, the 128 was available as a two-door or four-door sedan. At the 1970 [[Turin Motor Show]] a three-door [[station wagon]] model called \"Familiare\" was added to the line-up.<ref name=\"AU71\" /> The car was only available with a 1116&nbsp;cc engine on launch, though the two-door-only 128 Rally edition launched in 1971 used a 1,290&nbsp;cc unit. Also in 1971, the Sport Coup\u00e9, an all-new coup\u00e9 body on a shortened 128 platform, was unveiled at the Turin Show. On launch it was available with both existing 128 engines.\n\nThe 128 range underwent a [[Facelift (automotive)|facelift]] in 1972, featuring a revised grille. 1974 saw the launch of the 128 Special, which used the Rally engine in a four-door sedan body. In 1975 the 128 3P (3-door) Berlinetta replaced the Sport Coup\u00e9. In 1976, the range received new bumpers, rectangular [[headlights]], tail lights and dashboard as well as modifications to the engines. At this time, the wagon was also renamed the \"Panorama\".\n\nProduction of all 128s except that of the base 1,100&nbsp;cc powered model ended in 1979 after the introduction of the [[Fiat Ritmo/Strada]] in 1978. In 1980 production of the small three-door station wagon Panorama was dropped from the range and 128 production finally ended in 1985.<ref name=Greats/>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Road test==\nThe British \"[[The Motor (magazine)|Motor]]\" magazine tested a Fiat 128 in April 1970, shortly after its UK launch.  The car had a top speed of {{convert|85.4|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} and accelerated from 0-{{convert|60|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in 15.5 seconds. An \"overall\" fuel consumption of {{convert|27.5|mpgimp|L/100 km mpgus}} was recorded. This put it fractionally behind the contemporary [[BMC ADO16|Morris 1300]] on maximum speed but usefully ahead on acceleration.

The 128-based Zastavas were available throughout Europe in the '70s. In Britain, three variants were offered: a three-door hatchback (Zastava Yugo 311/313), four-door saloon (Zastava Yugo 411/413) and a five-door hatchback (Zastava Yugo 511/513). As one of the Serbian automaker's most affordable models, production ended in November 2008.\n\nZastava also produced the 128 in its original, four-door sedan form. Until 2009, [[Complete knock down|CKD]] kits were manufactured by Egypt's [[Nasr (car company)|Nasr]] car company as the Nasr 128.<ref name=\"italiaspeed\" />\n\nIn Argentina, the 128 was produced from 1971 to 1990 as a four-door sedan or five-door wagon, the Fiat 128 Rural, the latter unique to Argentina.<ref>http://www.cocheargentino.com.ar/f/fiat_128.htm</ref> Several trims and versions were available, including the IAVA sport series. In 1983 the car received a facelift with new headlamps, tail lamps and front grille, which was marketed as the '''Super Europa'''. In Colombia, the 128 was produced by \"Compa\u00f1\u00eda Colombiana Automotriz\" in Bogota.\n\nIn Spain, [[SEAT]] manufactured its own version of a 128 coup\u00e9, with its own bodywork. It was available with a 1200 or a 1,430&nbsp;cc Fiat 124 engine and was later replaced by the 3P Berlinetta model (31,893 copies).\n\nIn Sri Lanka, the Fiat 128 was manufactured by the [[Upali Motor Company]] until 1978.

As engineered by [[Alec Issigonis]], the compact arrangement located the transmission and engine sharing a single oil sump &mdash; despite disparate lubricating requirements &mdash; and had the engine's radiator mounted to the side of the engine, away from the flow of fresh air and drawing heated rather than cool air over the engine.

Also in 1971, the Sport Coup\u00e9, an all-new coup\u00e9 body on a shortened 128 platform, was unveiled at the Turin Show. On launch it was available with both existing 128 engines.\n\nThe 128 range underwent a [[Facelift (automotive)|facelift]] in 1972, featuring a revised grille. 1974 saw the launch of the 128 Special, which used the Rally engine in a four-door sedan body.

In 1976, the range received new bumpers, rectangular [[headlights]], tail lights and dashboard as well as modifications to the engines. At this time, the wagon was also renamed the \"Panorama\".\n\nProduction of all 128s except that of the base 1,100&nbsp;cc powered model ended in 1979 after the introduction of the [[Fiat Ritmo/Strada]] in 1978.

The 128&nbsp;3P used the existing design back to the B-pillar, with some detail modifications to the grille and headlights.\n\nThe Coup\u00e9 version was available with two different engines (1100 and 1300) and in two different trim levels (S and SL) for a total of four variants.<ref name=\"lastampa coup\u00e9 october\" />\nIn its base \"S\" trim, the coup\u00e9 had single rectangular front headlamps, and wheels and hubcaps from the saloon. The pricier \"SL\" (for Sport Lusso) was distinguished by quadruple round headlamps, a specific grille, steel sport wheels without hubcaps, chromed window surround trim, door handles and fuel cap, and black decorative striping along the sills and across the tail panel. Inside it gained a leatherette-wrapped steering wheels, perforated leatherette upholstery, extended four-gauge instrumentation, loop pile carpeting and black headlining.\n\nThe two engines were developed from the units found in the 128 saloon and 128 Rally respectively, and both were fitted with twin-choke carburettors and a two-piece [[exhaust manifold]].

The 128-based Zastavas were available throughout Europe in the '70s. In Britain, three variants were offered: a three-door hatchback (Zastava Yugo 311/313), four-door saloon (Zastava Yugo 411/413) and a five-door hatchback (Zastava Yugo 511/513). As one of the Serbian automaker's most affordable models, production ended in November 2008.\n\nZastava also produced the 128 in its original, four-door sedan form. Until 2009, [[Complete knock down|CKD]] kits were manufactured by Egypt's [[Nasr (car company)|Nasr]] car company as the Nasr 128.<ref name=\"italiaspeed\" />\n\nIn Argentina, the 128 was produced from 1971 to 1990 as a four-door sedan or five-door wagon, the Fiat 128 Rural, the latter unique to Argentina.<ref>http://www.cocheargentino.com.ar/f/fiat_128.htm</ref> Several trims and versions were available, including the IAVA sport series. In 1983 the car received a facelift with new headlamps, tail lamps and front grille, which was marketed as the '''Super Europa'''. In Colombia, the 128 was produced by \"Compa\u00f1\u00eda Colombiana Automotriz\" in Bogota.\n\nIn Spain, [[SEAT]] manufactured its own version of a 128 coup\u00e9, with its own bodywork. It was available with a 1200 or a 1,430&nbsp;cc Fiat 124 engine and was later replaced by the 3P Berlinetta model (31,893 copies).\n\nIn Sri Lanka, the Fiat 128 was manufactured by the [[Upali Motor Company]] until 1978. For South Africa only, a pickup version was also developed by Fiat in Italy to contest that country's popular \"bakkie\" category.

As part of these plans that were published in the early 1990s, a number of both conventional and [[nuclear-powered icebreaker]] icebreaker type size series were developed, ranging from 7-megawatt auxiliary icebreakers (LK-7) operating near large ports to 110-megawatt nuclear icebreakers (LK-110Ya) capable of breaking ice up to {{convert|3.5|m|ft|0}} thick.

Of these, the 25-megawatt line icebreakers (LK-25) were intended to escort [[merchant ship]]s and lead convoys through freezing seas, and operate as auxiliary ships in complex convoys along the [[Northern Sea Route]].

She was originally built by [[Burrard Dry Dock|Burrard-Yarrows Corporation]] in [[Canada]] in 1983 as part of an Arctic drilling system developed by [[BeauDril]], the drilling subsidiary of [[Gulf Canada Resources]]. After the offshore oil exploration in the [[Beaufort Sea]] ended in the early 1990s, she was first leased and then sold to the Canadian Coast Guard.\n\n''Terry Fox''{{'}}s sister ship, ''Kalvik'', is today owned by the Russian [[Murmansk Shipping Company]] as [[Vladimir Ignatyuk (icebreaker)|''Vladimir Ignatyuk'']].\n\n== Development and construction ==\n\nIn the mid-1970s, [[Gulf Canada Resources]] began developing an Arctic drilling system consisting of two mobile drilling units: a Mobile Arctic Caisson (MAC) that could be submerged and filled with gravel to form an artificial drilling island in waters up to {{convert|40|m|ft}} in depth and a floating Conical Drilling Unit (CDU) designed for drilling in water depths between {{convert|40|and|60|m|ft}} while afloat. The intention of this development was to overcome the relatively short operating window of [[drillship]]s during the ice-free season (100 to 110 days a year) and the water depth limitations of artificial dredged islands in the Canadian part of the [[Beaufort Sea]]. The drilling units, each capable of completing one exploration well per year, would be supported by four Arctic Class 4 vessels: two large icebreakers providing 24-hour [[ice management]] and standby services on the drilling site and two smaller icebreaking vessels responsible for anchor handling and supply runs between the drilling rigs and coastal bases. By 1982, both drilling units and all four icebreaking vessels were under construction in Canada and Japan for [[BeauDril]], Gulf Canada's drilling subsidiary, and the company had committed itself to a billion-dollar exploration program between 1983 and 1988.<ref name=\"marks1982\">{{Citation|last=Marks|first=Adams|title=Gulf's Proposed Drilling Systems for the Beaufort Sea|journal=APOA Review|volume=5|issue=2|pages=9\u201312|year=1982}}</ref>\n\nThe icebreaker design was provided by the Montreal-based engineering company [[German & Milne]]. During the development phase, the hull form was extensively tested at the Hamburg Ship Model Basin (HSVA) [[ice tank]] with particular emphasis of preventing broken ice floes from flowing under the hull and into the propellers. The result was a production-friendly [[developable surface|fully-developable hull form]] with a semi-spoon bow and large ice plough.<ref name=\"canadianshipping_oct1983\">{{cite|url=https://trid.trb.org/view/418548|title=Kalvik and Terry Fox: Arctic Class 4 icebreaking, anchor-handling tug/supply vessels|date=October 1983|work=Canadian Shipping and Marine Engineering|pages=31\u201335|volume=55}}</ref><ref name=\"smei_sept1983\">{{cite|title=Gulf's Arctic class 4 multi-purpose icebreakers|date=September 1983|work=Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering International|page=348}}</ref> The construction of the two icebreakers was awarded to [[Burrard Dry Dock|Burrard-Yarrows Corporation]] in December 1979 and the work was split between the company's [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]] and [[Vancouver]] divisions.

Each pair of main engines is coupled to a Lohmann & Stolterfoht Navilus GVE 1500 A single-stage reduction gearbox via flexible couplings designed to automatically disengage if the propellers are blocked by ice. However, each propeller shaft is also fitted with a heavy flywheel {{convert|3|m|ft|0}} in diameter and {{convert|0.6|m|ft|0}} in thickness to increase rotational inertia and absorb shocks from propeller-ice interaction. Unlike the other Canadian offshore icebreakers built in the 1980s, ''Terry Fox'' does not have a [[ducted propeller|propeller nozzles]] to shroud her propellers.<ref name=\"finesse\" /> Her {{convert|4.8|m|ft|adj=on}} LIPS Canada [[aluminium bronze|nickel aluminium bronze]] [[controllable pitch propeller]]s are designed to transmit {{convert|7132|kW|hp|disp=flip|abbr=on}} of power per shaft to the water and produce a combined static bollard pull of about {{convert|1590|kN|t-f}}. For onboard electricity production, the ship has two {{convert|750|kW|hp|abbr=on}} [[Caterpillar Inc.|Caterpillar]] 3512 series<ref name=\"ccg_terryfox\" /> ship service diesel generators and a single {{convert|200|kW|hp|abbr=on}} Caterpillar 3406 DITA emergency diesel generator.

When operating in ice-free waters, the ship was designed transit at an economical speed of about {{convert|14|kn}} with just two main engines,<ref name=\"motorship_oct1983\" /> but her maximum speed is quoted as {{convert|16|kn}}.<ref name=\"ccg_terryfox\" />\n\n== Career ==\n[[File:CCGS TerryFox May2008.jpg|thumb|left|CCGS ''Terry Fox'' docked at NewDock Shipyard in St. John's in 2008.]]\n\n=== ''Terry Fox'' (1983\u20131991) ===\n\nBetween 1983 and 1990, BeauDril's mobile drilling units drilled a total of nineteen exploratory wells in the Canadian part of the Beaufort Sea with the support of ''Terry Fox'' and other icebreaking vessels: nine with the Mobile Arctic Caisson ''[[Molikpaq]]'' and ten with the Conical Drilling Unit ''[[Kulluk]]''. Twelve wells alone were drilled in the Amauligak prospect, the most significant oil and gas field discovered in the region, but the high expectations for the Beaufort Sea were not met: the area was characterized by a large number of small, widely scattered resources.

She was originally built by [[Burrard Dry Dock|Burrard-Yarrows Corporation]] in [[Canada]] in 1983 as part of an Arctic drilling system developed by [[BeauDril]], the drilling subsidiary of [[Gulf Canada Resources]]. After the offshore oil exploration in the [[Beaufort Sea]] ended in the early 1990s, she was first leased and then sold to the Canadian Coast Guard.\n\n''Terry Fox''{{'}}s sister ship, ''Kalvik'', is today owned by the Russian [[Murmansk Shipping Company]] as [[Vladimir Ignatyuk (icebreaker)|''Vladimir Ignatyuk'']].\n\n== Development and construction ==\n\nIn the mid-1970s, [[Gulf Canada Resources]] began developing an Arctic drilling system consisting of two mobile drilling units: a Mobile Arctic Caisson (MAC) that could be submerged and filled with gravel to form an artificial drilling island in waters up to {{convert|40|m|ft}} in depth and a floating Conical Drilling Unit (CDU) designed for drilling in water depths between {{convert|40|and|60|m|ft}} while afloat. The intention of this development was to overcome the relatively short operating window of [[drillship]]s during the ice-free season (100 to 110 days a year) and the water depth limitations of artificial dredged islands in the Canadian part of the [[Beaufort Sea]]. The drilling units, each capable of completing one exploration well per year, would be supported by four Arctic Class 4 vessels: two large icebreakers providing 24-hour [[ice management]] and standby services on the drilling site and two smaller icebreaking vessels responsible for anchor handling and supply runs between the drilling rigs and coastal bases. By 1982, both drilling units and all four icebreaking vessels were under construction in Canada and Japan for [[BeauDril]], Gulf Canada's drilling subsidiary, and the company had committed itself to a billion-dollar exploration program between 1983 and 1988.<ref name=\"marks1982\">{{Citation|last=Marks|first=Adams|title=Gulf's Proposed Drilling Systems for the Beaufort Sea|journal=APOA Review|volume=5|issue=2|pages=9\u201312|year=1982}}</ref>\n\nThe icebreaker design was provided by the Montreal-based engineering company [[German & Milne]]. During the development phase, the hull form was extensively tested at the Hamburg Ship Model Basin (HSVA) [[ice tank]] with particular emphasis of preventing broken ice floes from flowing under the hull and into the propellers. The result was a production-friendly [[developable surface|fully-developable hull form]] with a semi-spoon bow and large ice plough.<ref name=\"canadianshipping_oct1983\">{{cite|url=https://trid.trb.org/view/418548|title=Kalvik and Terry Fox: Arctic Class 4 icebreaking, anchor-handling tug/supply vessels|date=October 1983|work=Canadian Shipping and Marine Engineering|pages=31\u201335|volume=55}}</ref><ref name=\"smei_sept1983\">{{cite|title=Gulf's Arctic class 4 multi-purpose icebreakers|date=September 1983|work=Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering International|page=348}}</ref> The construction of the two icebreakers was awarded to [[Burrard Dry Dock|Burrard-Yarrows Corporation]] in December 1979 and the work was split between the company's [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]] and [[Vancouver]] divisions.
