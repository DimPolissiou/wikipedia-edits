In 1894, the young chemist [[Felix Hoffmann]] joined the pharmaceutical group.

Dreser's group was soon busy testing Felix Hoffmann's next chemical success: [[diacetylmorphine]] (which the Bayer team soon branded as ''heroin'' because of the heroic feeling it gave them). Eichengr\u00fcn, frustrated by Dreser's rejection of ASA, went directly to Bayer's Berlin representative Felix Goldmann to arrange low-profile trials with doctors. Though the results of those trials were also very positive, with no reports of the typical salicylic acid complications, Dreser still demurred. However, Carl Duisberg intervened and scheduled full testing. Soon, Dreser admitted ASA's potential and Bayer decided to proceed with production.

In 1949, shortly before his death, Eichengr\u00fcn wrote an article, \"Fifty Years of Asprin\", claiming that he had not told Hoffmann the purpose of his research, meaning that Hoffmann merely carried out Eichengr\u00fcn's research plan, and that the drug would never have gone to the market without his direction.

''Spirs\u00e4ure'' (salicylic acid) was named for the [[meadowsweet]] plant, ''Spirea ulmaria'', from which it could be derived.<ref name=Jeffreys/>{{rp|40}} ''Aspirin'' took '''a'''- for the acetylation, -'''spir'''- from Spirs\u00e4ure, and added -'''in''' as a typical drug name ending to make it easy to say. In the final round of naming proposals that circulated through Bayer, it came down to ''Aspirin'' and ''Euspirin''; ''Aspirin'', they feared, might remind customers of [[Pulmonary aspiration|aspiration]], but Arthur Eichengr\u00fcn argued that ''Eu''- (meaning \"good\") was inappropriate because it usually indicated an improvement over an earlier version of a similar drug. Since the substance itself was already known, Bayer intended to use the new name to establish their drug as something new; in January 1899 they settled on ''Aspirin''.<ref name=Jeffreys/>{{rp|73}}<ref name=MannPlummer/>{{rp|27}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/bayer-patents-aspirin|title=Bayer patents aspirin|publisher=[[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]]|accessdate=5 March 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Rights and sale===\n\nUnder Carl Duisberg's leadership, Bayer was firmly committed to the standards of ethical drugs, as opposed to [[patent medicine]]s. ''Ethical drugs'' were drugs that could be obtained only through a pharmacist, usually with a doctor's prescription. [[Direct-to-consumer advertising|Advertising drugs directly to consumers]] was considered unethical and strongly opposed by many medical organizations; that was the domain of patent medicines. Therefore, Bayer was limited to marketing Aspirin directly to doctors.<ref name=Jeffreys/>{{rp|80\u201383}}\n\nWhen production of Aspirin began in 1899, Bayer sent out small packets of the drug to doctors, pharmacists and hospitals, advising them of Aspirin's uses and encouraging them to publish about the drug's effects and effectiveness. As positive results came in and enthusiasm grew, Bayer sought to secure patent and trademark wherever possible. It was ineligible for patent in Germany (despite being accepted briefly before the decision was overturned), but Aspirin was patented in Britain (filed 22 December 1898) and the United States (US Patent 644,077 issued 27 February 1900). The British patent was overturned in 1905, the American patent was also besieged but was ultimately upheld.<ref name=Jeffreys/>{{rp|77\u201380}}\n\nFaced with growing legal and illegal competition for the globally marketed ASA, Bayer worked to cement the connection between Bayer and Aspirin. One strategy it developed was to switch from distributing Aspirin powder for pharmacists to press into pill form to distributing standardized tablets\u2014complete with the distinctive ''Bayer cross'' logo. In 1903 the company set up an American subsidiary, with a converted factory in [[Rensselaer, New York]], to produce Aspirin for the American market without paying [[Import tariff|import duties]]. Bayer also sued the most egregious patent violators and smugglers. The company's attempts to hold onto its Aspirin sales incited criticism from muckraking journalists and the [[American Medical Association]], especially after the 1906 [[Pure Food and Drug Act]] that prevented trademarked drugs from being listed in the [[United States Pharmacopeia]]; Bayer listed ASA with an intentionally convoluted generic name (monoacetic acid ester of salicylic acid) to discourage doctors referring to anything but Aspirin.<ref name=Jeffreys/>{{rp|88\u201396}}<ref name=MannPlummer/>{{rp|28\u201331}}\n\n==World War I and Bayer==\nBy the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914, Bayer was facing competition in all its major markets from local ASA producers as well as other German drug firms (particularly Heyden and [[Hoechst AG|Hoechst]]). The British market was immediately closed to the [[List of German companies|German companies]], but British manufacturing could not meet the demand\u2014especially with [[phenol]] supplies, necessary for ASA synthesis, largely being used for explosives manufacture. On 5 February 1915, Bayer's UK trademarks were voided, so that any company could use the term ''aspirin''. The Australian market was taken over by ''Aspro'', after the makers of Nicholas-Aspirin lost a short-lived [[exclusive right]] to the ''aspirin'' name there. In the United States, Bayer was still under German control\u2014though the war disrupted the links between the American Bayer plant and the German Bayer headquarters\u2014but phenol shortage threatened to reduce aspirin production to a trickle, and imports across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] were blocked by [[Royal Navy|the Royal Navy]].<ref name=Jeffreys/>{{rp|97\u2013110}}\n\n===Great Phenol Plot===\n{{Main|Great Phenol Plot}}\n[[File:New York World front page, August 15, 1915.jpg|thumb|The edition of 15 August 1915 of the ''[[New York World]]'' broke the news of the Great Phenol Plot and other clandestine pro-German activities that were organized by [[Johann Heinrich von Bernstorff]] and [[Heinrich Alberts]].]]\n\nTo secure phenol for aspirin production, and at the same time indirectly aid the German war effort, German agents in the United States orchestrated what became known as the [[Great Phenol Plot]]. By 1915, the price of phenol rose to the point that Bayer's aspirin plant was forced to drastically cut production. This was especially problematic because Bayer was instituting a new [[brand management|branding]] strategy in preparation of the expiry of the aspirin patent in the United States. [[Thomas Edison]], who needed phenol to manufacture [[phonograph]] records, was also facing supply problems; in response, he created a phenol factory capable of pumping out twelve tons per day. Edison's excess phenol seemed destined for [[trinitrophenol]] production.<ref name=MannPlummer/>{{rp|39\u201341}}<ref name=Jeffreys/>{{rp|109\u2013113}}\n\nAlthough the United States remained officially neutral until April 1917, it was increasingly throwing its support to the Allies through trade. To counter this, German ambassador [[Johann Heinrich von Bernstorff]] and Interior Ministry official [[Heinrich Albert]] were tasked with undermining American industry and maintaining public support for Germany. One of their agents was a former Bayer employee, Hugo Schweitzer.<ref name=MannPlummer/>{{rp|38\u201339}} Schweitzer set up a contract for a front company called the Chemical Exchange Association to buy all of Edison's excess phenol. Much of the phenol would go to the German-owned Chemische Fabrik von Heyden's American subsidiary; Heyden was the supplier of Bayer's salicylic acid for aspirin manufacture. By July 1915, Edison's plants were selling about three tons of phenol per day to Schweitzer; Heyden's salicylic acid production was soon back on line, and in turn Bayer's aspirin plant was running as well.<ref name=MannPlummer/>{{rp|40\u201341}}\n\nThe plot only lasted a few months. On 24 July 1915, Heinrich Albert's briefcase, containing details about the phenol plot, was recovered by a [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agent. Although the activities were not illegal\u2014since the United States was still officially neutral and still trading with Germany\u2014the documents were soon leaked to the ''[[New York World]]'', an anti-German newspaper. The ''World'' published an [[Expos\u00e9 (journalism)|expos\u00e9]] on 15 August 1915.<ref name=MannPlummer/>{{rp|41\u201342}} The public pressure soon forced Schweitzer and Edison to end the phenol deal\u2014with the embarrassed Edison subsequently sending his excess phenol to the U.S. military\u2014but by that time the deal had netted the plotters over two million dollars and there was already enough phenol to keep Bayer's Aspirin plant running. Bayer's reputation took a large hit, however, just as the company was preparing to launch an advertising campaign to secure the connection between aspirin and the Bayer brand.<ref name=Jeffreys/>{{rp|113\u2013114}}\n\n===Bayer loses foreign holdings===\nBeginning in 1915, Bayer set up a number of [[shell corporation]]s and subsidiaries in the United States, to hedge against the possibility of losing control of its American assets if the U.S. should enter the war and to allow Bayer to enter other markets (e.g., army uniforms). After the U.S. declared war on Germany in April 1917, [[Alien Property Custodian|alien property custodian]] [[A. Mitchell Palmer]] began investigating German-owned businesses, and soon turned his attention to Bayer. To avoid having to surrender all profits and assets to the government, Bayer's management shifted the stock to a new company, nominally owned by Americans but controlled by the German-American Bayer leaders. Palmer, however, soon uncovered this scheme and seized all of Bayer's American holdings. After the [[Trading with the Enemy Act]] was amended to allow sale of these holdings, the government auctioned off the Rensselaer plant and all Bayer's American patents and trademarks, including even the Bayer brand name and the Bayer cross logo. It was bought by a patent medicine company, [[Sterling Products, Inc.]].<ref name=MannPlummer/>{{rp|42\u201349}} The rights to Bayer Aspirin and the U.S. rights to the Bayer name and trademarks were sold back to Bayer AG in 1994 for US$1 billion.<ref name=ACS/>\n\n==Interwar years==\n[[File:Bayer Aspirin ad, NYT, February 19, 1917.jpg|thumb|Bayer began advertising directly to American consumers just before the expiration of the aspirin patent.

Its fever-reducing properties gave many sick patients enough strength to fight through the infection, and aspirin companies large and small earned the loyalty of doctors and the public\u2014when they could manufacture or purchase enough aspirin to meet demand. Despite this, some people believed that Germans put the Spanish flu bug in [[Bayer]] aspirin, causing the pandemic as a war tactic.<ref name=Jeffreys/>{{rp|136\u2013142}} \n[[File:Bayer-Tablets of Aspirin ad 1918.png|thumbnail|left|Newspaper ad for Bayer Aspirin from April 1918.

In 1920, [[United Drug Company]] challenged the ''Aspirin'' trademark, which became officially generic for public sale in the U.S. (although it remained trademarked when sold to wholesalers and pharmacists). With demand growing rapidly in the wake of the Spanish flu, there were soon hundreds of \"aspirin\" brands on sale in the United States.<ref name=Jeffreys/>{{rp|151\u2013152}}\n\nSterling Products, equipped with all of Bayer's U.S. intellectual property, tried to take advantage of its new brand as quickly as possible, before generic ASAs took over. However, without German expertise to run the Rensselaer plant to make aspirin and the other Bayer pharmaceuticals, they had only a finite aspirin supply and were facing competition from other companies. Sterling president William E. Weiss had ambitions to sell Bayer aspirin not only in the U.S., but to compete with the German Bayer abroad as well. Taking advantage of the losses [[Farbenfabriken Bayer]] (the German Bayer company) suffered through the [[World War I reparations|reparation provisions]] of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], Weiss worked out a deal with Carl Duisberg to share profits in the Americas, Australia, South Africa and Great Britain for most Bayer drugs, in return for technical assistance in manufacturing the drugs.<ref name=Jeffreys/>{{rp|144\u2013150}}\n\nSterling also took over Bayer's Canadian assets as well as ownership of the Aspirin trademark which is still valid in Canada<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=21289783 |pmc=2306102 |year=1981 |last1=Kiefer |first1=J.

The Australian company Nicholas Proprietary Limited, through the aggressive [[Marketing strategy|marketing strategies]] of George Davies, built ''[[Aspirin|Aspro]]'' into a global brand, with particular strength in Australia, New Zealand, and the U.K.<ref name=Jeffreys/>{{rp|153\u2013161}} American brands such as ''Burton's Aspirin'', ''Molloy's Aspirin'', ''Cal-Aspirin'' and ''St. Joseph Aspirin'' tried to compete with the American Bayer, while new products such ''Cafaspirin'' (aspirin with [[caffeine]]) and ''[[Alka-Seltzer]]'' (a soluble mix of aspirin and [[bicarbonate of soda]]) put aspirin to new uses.<ref name=Jeffreys/>{{rp|161\u2013162}} In 1925, the German Bayer became part of [[IG Farben]], a conglomerate of former dye companies; IG Farben's brands of ''Aspirin'' and, in [[Latin America]], the caffeinated ''Cafiaspirina'' (co-managed with Sterling Products) competed with less expensive aspirins such as ''Geniol''.<ref name=MannPlummer/>{{rp|78,90}}\n\n==Competition from new drugs==\nAfter World War II, with the [[IG Farben]] conglomerate dismantled because of its central role in the [[Nazi]] regime, Sterling Products bought half of Bayer Ltd, the British Bayer subsidiary\u2014the other half of which it already owned. However, ''Bayer Aspirin'' made up only a small fraction of the British aspirin market because of competition from ''Aspro'', ''Disprin'' (a soluble aspirin drug) and other brands. Bayer Ltd began searching for new pain relievers to compete more effectively. After several moderately successful compound drugs that mainly utilized aspirin (''[[Anadin]]'' and ''Excedrin''), Bayer Ltd's manager Laurie Spalton ordered an investigation of a substance that scientists at Yale had, in 1946, found to be the metabolically active derivative of acetanilide: [[acetaminophen]]. After clinical trials, Bayer Ltd brought acetaminophen to market as ''Panadol'' in 1956.<ref name=Jeffreys/>{{rp|205\u2013207}}\n\nHowever, Sterling Products did not market ''Panadol'' in the United States or other countries where ''Bayer Aspirin'' still dominated the aspirin market. Other firms began selling acetaminophen drugs, most significantly, [[McNeil Laboratories]] with liquid ''[[Tylenol (brand)|Tylenol]]'' in 1955, and ''Tylenol'' pills in 1958. By 1967, ''Tylenol'' was available without a prescription. Because it did not cause gastric irritation, acetaminophen rapidly displaced much of aspirin's sales. Another analgesic, anti-inflammatory drug was introduced in 1962: [[ibuprofen]] (sold as ''Brufen'' in the U.K. and ''Motrin'' in the U.S.). By the 1970s, aspirin had a relatively small portion of the pain reliever market, and in the 1980s sales decreased even more when ibuprofen became available without prescription.<ref name=Jeffreys/>{{rp|212\u2013217}}\n\nAlso in the early 1980s, several studies suggested a link between children's consumption of aspirin and [[Reye's syndrome]], a potentially fatal disease. By 1986, the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] required [[warning label]]s on all aspirin, further suppressing sales. The makers of ''Tylenol'' also filed a lawsuit against ''Anacin'' aspirin maker [[American Home Products]], claiming that the failure to add warning labels before 1986 had unfairly held back ''Tylenol'' sales, though this suit was eventually dismissed.<ref name=MannPlummer/>{{rp|228\u2013229}}\n\n==Investigating how aspirin works==\n{{See also|Mechanism of action of aspirin}}\nThe mechanism of aspirin's analgesic, anti-inflammatory and [[antipyretic]] properties was unknown through the drug's heyday in the early- to mid-twentieth century; Heinrich Dreser's explanation, widely accepted since the drug was first brought to market, was that aspirin relieved pain by acting on the [[central nervous system]]. In 1958 Harry Collier, a biochemist in the London laboratory of pharmaceutical company [[Parke-Davis]], began investigating the relationship between [[Kinin-kallikrein system|kinins]] and the effects of aspirin. In tests on [[guinea pig]]s, Collier found that aspirin, if given beforehand, inhibited the [[bronchoconstriction]] effects of [[bradykinin]]. He found that cutting the guinea pigs' [[vagus nerve]] did not affect the action of bradykinin ''or'' the inhibitory effect of aspirin\u2014evidence that aspirin worked locally to combat pain and inflammation, rather than on the central nervous system. In 1963, Collier began working with [[University of London]] pharmacology graduate student Priscilla Piper to determine the precise mechanism of aspirin's effects. However, it was difficult to pin down the precise biochemical goings-on in live research animals, and ''[[in vitro]]'' tests on removed animal tissues did not behave like ''[[in vivo]]'' tests.<ref name=Jeffreys/>{{rp|223\u2013226}}\n\nAfter five years of collaboration, Collier arranged for Piper to work with pharmacologist [[John Vane]] at the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England]], in order to learn Vane's new [[bioassay]] methods, which seemed like a possible solution to the ''in vitro'' testing failures. Vane and Piper tested the [[biochemical cascade]] associated with [[anaphylactic shock]] (in extracts from guinea pig lungs, applied to tissue from [[rabbit]] [[aorta]]s). They found that aspirin inhibited the release of an unidentified chemical generated by guinea pig lungs, a chemical that caused rabbit tissue to contract. By 1971, Vane identified the chemical (which they called \"rabbit-aorta contracting substance,\" or RCS) as a [[prostaglandin]]. In a 23 June 1971 paper in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', Vane and Piper suggested that aspirin and similar drugs (the [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s or NSAIDs) worked by blocking the production of prostaglandins. Later research showed that NSAIDs such as aspirin worked by inhibiting [[cyclooxygenase]], the enzyme responsible for converting [[arachidonic acid]] into a prostaglandin.<ref name=Jeffreys/>{{rp|226\u2013231}}\n\n==Revival as heart drug==\nAspirin's effects on [[Coagulation|blood clotting]] (as an [[antiplatelet agent]]) were first noticed in 1950 by [[Lawrence Craven]]. Craven, a [[family doctor]] in California, had been directing [[tonsillectomy]] patients to chew [[Aspergum]], an aspirin-laced [[chewing gum]]. He found that an unusual number of patients had to be hospitalized for severe bleeding, and that those patients had been using very high amounts of Aspergum. Craven began recommending daily aspirin to all his patients, and claimed that the patients who followed the aspirin regimen (about 8,000 people) had no signs of [[thrombosis]]. However, Craven's studies were not taken seriously by the medical community, because he had not done a [[placebo]]-[[scientific control|controlled]] study and had published only in obscure journals.<ref name=Jeffreys/>{{rp|237\u2013239}} <ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Miner J, Hoffhines A |title=The discovery of aspirin's antithrombotic effects |journal=Tex Heart Inst J |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=179\u201386 |year=2007 |pmid=17622365 |pmc=1894700}}</ref>\n\nThe idea of using aspirin to prevent clotting diseases (such as heart attacks and strokes) was revived in the 1960s, when medical researcher Harvey Weiss found that aspirin had an anti-adhesive effect on [[Platelet|blood platelets]] (and unlike other potential antiplatelet drugs, aspirin had low toxicity). [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]] haematologist John O'Brien picked up on Weiss's finding and, in 1963, began working with epidemiologist Peter Elwood on aspirin's anti-thrombosis drug potential. Elwood began a large-scale trial of aspirin as a preventive drug for heart attacks. Nicholas Laboratories agreed to provide aspirin tablets, and Elwood enlisted heart attack survivors in a [[Blind experiment|double-blind]] controlled study\u2014heart attack survivors were statistically more likely to suffer a second attack, greatly reducing the number of patients necessary to reliably detect whether aspirin had an effect on heart attacks. The study began in February 1971, though the researchers soon had to break the double-blinding when a study by American epidemiologist [[Hershel Jick]] suggested that aspirin prevented heart attacks but suggested that the heart attacks were more deadly.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D9eRDgAAQBAJ&pg=PT491|page=491|title=The Chemical Century: Molecular Manipulation and Its Impact on the 20th Century|first=Richard J.|last=Sundberg|publisher=CRC|year=2017|isbn=9781315342030}}</ref> Jick had found that fewer aspirin-takers were admitted to his hospital for heart attacks than non-aspirin-takers, and one possible explanation was that aspirin caused heart attack sufferers to die before reaching the hospital; Elwood's initial results ruled out that explanation. When the Elwood trial ended in 1973, it showed a modest but not [[Statistical significance|statistically significant]] reduction in heart attacks among the group taking aspirin.<ref name=Jeffreys/>{{rp|239\u2013246}}\n\nSeveral subsequent studies put aspirin's effectiveness as a heart drug on firmer ground, but the evidence was not incontrovertible. However, in the mid-1980s, with the relatively new technique of [[meta-analysis]], statistician [[Richard Peto]] convinced the U.S. FDA and much of the medical community that the aspirin studies, in aggregate, showed aspirin's effectiveness with relative certainty.<ref name=Jeffreys/>{{rp|247\u2013257}} By the end of the 1980s, aspirin was widely used as a preventive drug for heart attacks and had regained its former position as the top-selling analgesic in the U.S.<ref name=Jeffreys/>{{rp|267\u2013269}}\n\nIn 2018, three major clinical trials cast doubt on that conventional wisdom, finding few benefits and consistent bleeding risks associated with daily aspirin use. Taken together, the findings led the [[American Heart Association]] and [[American College of Cardiology]] to change clinical practice guidelines in early 2019, recommending against the routine use of aspirin in people older than 70 years or people with increased bleeding risk who do not have existing cardiovascular disease.<ref>[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/07/190722182126.htm \"Widespread aspirin use despite few benefits, high risks.\"], Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.

He collected, dried, and powdered a substantial amount of willow bark, and over the next five years tested it on a number of people sick with fever and agues. In his letter, Stone reported consistent success, describing willow extract's effects as identical to Peruvian bark, though a little less potent. (In fact, the [[active ingredient]] of Peruvian bark was [[quinine]], which attacked the infectious cause of malaria, while the active ingredient of willow extract, [[salicin]], relieved the symptoms of malaria but could not cure it.)

Antifebrine's success inspired [[Carl Duisberg]], the head of research at the small dye firm [[Friedrich Bayer & Company]], to start a systematic search for other chemical fever-reducers.

In 1894, the young chemist [[Felix Hoffmann]] joined the pharmaceutical group.

Dreser's group was soon busy testing Felix Hoffmann's next chemical success: [[diacetylmorphine]] (which the Bayer team soon branded as ''heroin'' because of the heroic feeling it gave them). Eichengr\u00fcn, frustrated by Dreser's rejection of ASA, went directly to Bayer's Berlin representative Felix Goldmann to arrange low-profile trials with doctors. Though the results of those trials were also very positive, with no reports of the typical salicylic acid complications, Dreser still demurred. However, Carl Duisberg intervened and scheduled full testing. Soon, Dreser admitted ASA's potential and Bayer decided to proceed with production.

Although aspirin's origin was in academic research and Bayer was not the first to synthesize it, as of 2016 Bayer still described Hoffman as having \"discovered a pain-relieving, fever-lowering and anti-inflammatory substance.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Felix Hoffmann \u2013 Personalities of Bayer's History|url=http://www.bayer.com/en/Felix-Hoffmann.aspx|publisher=Bayer|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161116080345/http://www.bayer.com/en/Felix-Hoffmann.aspx|archivedate=16 November 2016}}</ref> Historians and others have also challenged Bayer's early accounts of Bayer's synthesis, in which Hoffmann was primarily responsible for the Bayer breakthrough. In 1949, shortly before his death, Eichengr\u00fcn wrote an article, \"Fifty Years of Asprin\", claiming that he had not told Hoffmann the purpose of his research, meaning that Hoffmann merely carried out Eichengr\u00fcn's research plan, and that the drug would never have gone to the market without his direction.

''Spirs\u00e4ure'' (salicylic acid) was named for the [[meadowsweet]] plant, ''Spirea ulmaria'', from which it could be derived.<ref name=Jeffreys/>{{rp|40}} ''Aspirin'' took '''a'''- for the acetylation, -'''spir'''- from Spirs\u00e4ure, and added -'''in''' as a typical drug name ending to make it easy to say. In the final round of naming proposals that circulated through Bayer, it came down to ''Aspirin'' and ''Euspirin''; ''Aspirin'', they feared, might remind customers of [[Pulmonary aspiration|aspiration]], but Arthur Eichengr\u00fcn argued that ''Eu''- (meaning \"good\") was inappropriate because it usually indicated an improvement over an earlier version of a similar drug. Since the substance itself was already known, Bayer intended to use the new name to establish their drug as something new; in January 1899 they settled on ''Aspirin''.<ref name=Jeffreys/>{{rp|73}}<ref name=MannPlummer/>{{rp|27}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/bayer-patents-aspirin|title=Bayer patents aspirin|publisher=[[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]]|accessdate=5 March 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Rights and sale===\n\nUnder Carl Duisberg's leadership, Bayer was firmly committed to the standards of ethical drugs, as opposed to [[patent medicine]]s. ''Ethical drugs'' were drugs that could be obtained only through a pharmacist, usually with a doctor's prescription. [[Direct-to-consumer advertising|Advertising drugs directly to consumers]] was considered unethical and strongly opposed by many medical organizations; that was the domain of patent medicines. Therefore, Bayer was limited to marketing Aspirin directly to doctors.<ref name=Jeffreys/>{{rp|80\u201383}}\n\nWhen production of Aspirin began in 1899, Bayer sent out small packets of the drug to doctors, pharmacists and hospitals, advising them of Aspirin's uses and encouraging them to publish about the drug's effects and effectiveness. As positive results came in and enthusiasm grew, Bayer sought to secure patent and trademark wherever possible. It was ineligible for patent in Germany (despite being accepted briefly before the decision was overturned), but Aspirin was patented in Britain (filed 22 December 1898) and the United States (US Patent 644,077 issued 27 February 1900). The British patent was overturned in 1905, the American patent was also besieged but was ultimately upheld.<ref name=Jeffreys/>{{rp|77\u201380}}\n\nFaced with growing legal and illegal competition for the globally marketed ASA, Bayer worked to cement the connection between Bayer and Aspirin. One strategy it developed was to switch from distributing Aspirin powder for pharmacists to press into pill form to distributing standardized tablets\u2014complete with the distinctive ''Bayer cross'' logo. In 1903 the company set up an American subsidiary, with a converted factory in [[Rensselaer, New York]], to produce Aspirin for the American market without paying [[Import tariff|import duties]]. Bayer also sued the most egregious patent violators and smugglers. The company's attempts to hold onto its Aspirin sales incited criticism from muckraking journalists and the [[American Medical Association]], especially after the 1906 [[Pure Food and Drug Act]] that prevented trademarked drugs from being listed in the [[United States Pharmacopeia]]; Bayer listed ASA with an intentionally convoluted generic name (monoacetic acid ester of salicylic acid) to discourage doctors referring to anything but Aspirin.<ref name=Jeffreys/>{{rp|88\u201396}}<ref name=MannPlummer/>{{rp|28\u201331}}\n\n==World War I and Bayer==\nBy the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914, Bayer was facing competition in all its major markets from local ASA producers as well as other German drug firms (particularly Heyden and [[Hoechst AG|Hoechst]]). The British market was immediately closed to the [[List of German companies|German companies]], but British manufacturing could not meet the demand\u2014especially with [[phenol]] supplies, necessary for ASA synthesis, largely being used for explosives manufacture. On 5 February 1915, Bayer's UK trademarks were voided, so that any company could use the term ''aspirin''. The Australian market was taken over by ''Aspro'', after the makers of Nicholas-Aspirin lost a short-lived [[exclusive right]] to the ''aspirin'' name there. In the United States, Bayer was still under German control\u2014though the war disrupted the links between the American Bayer plant and the German Bayer headquarters\u2014but phenol shortage threatened to reduce aspirin production to a trickle, and imports across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] were blocked by [[Royal Navy|the Royal Navy]].<ref name=Jeffreys/>{{rp|97\u2013110}}\n\n===Great Phenol Plot===\n{{Main|Great Phenol Plot}}\n[[File:New York World front page, August 15, 1915.jpg|thumb|The edition of 15 August 1915 of the ''[[New York World]]'' broke the news of the Great Phenol Plot and other clandestine pro-German activities that were organized by [[Johann Heinrich von Bernstorff]] and [[Heinrich Alberts]].]]\n\nTo secure phenol for aspirin production, and at the same time indirectly aid the German war effort, German agents in the United States orchestrated what became known as the [[Great Phenol Plot]]. By 1915, the price of phenol rose to the point that Bayer's aspirin plant was forced to drastically cut production. This was especially problematic because Bayer was instituting a new [[brand management|branding]] strategy in preparation of the expiry of the aspirin patent in the United States. [[Thomas Edison]], who needed phenol to manufacture [[phonograph]] records, was also facing supply problems; in response, he created a phenol factory capable of pumping out twelve tons per day. Edison's excess phenol seemed destined for [[trinitrophenol]] production.<ref name=MannPlummer/>{{rp|39\u201341}}<ref name=Jeffreys/>{{rp|109\u2013113}}\n\nAlthough the United States remained officially neutral until April 1917, it was increasingly throwing its support to the Allies through trade. To counter this, German ambassador [[Johann Heinrich von Bernstorff]] and Interior Ministry official [[Heinrich Albert]] were tasked with undermining American industry and maintaining public support for Germany. One of their agents was a former Bayer employee, Hugo Schweitzer.<ref name=MannPlummer/>{{rp|38\u201339}} Schweitzer set up a contract for a front company called the Chemical Exchange Association to buy all of Edison's excess phenol. Much of the phenol would go to the German-owned Chemische Fabrik von Heyden's American subsidiary; Heyden was the supplier of Bayer's salicylic acid for aspirin manufacture. By July 1915, Edison's plants were selling about three tons of phenol per day to Schweitzer; Heyden's salicylic acid production was soon back on line, and in turn Bayer's aspirin plant was running as well.<ref name=MannPlummer/>{{rp|40\u201341}}\n\nThe plot only lasted a few months. On 24 July 1915, Heinrich Albert's briefcase, containing details about the phenol plot, was recovered by a [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agent. Although the activities were not illegal\u2014since the United States was still officially neutral and still trading with Germany\u2014the documents were soon leaked to the ''[[New York World]]'', an anti-German newspaper. The ''World'' published an [[Expos\u00e9 (journalism)|expos\u00e9]] on 15 August 1915.<ref name=MannPlummer/>{{rp|41\u201342}} The public pressure soon forced Schweitzer and Edison to end the phenol deal\u2014with the embarrassed Edison subsequently sending his excess phenol to the U.S. military\u2014but by that time the deal had netted the plotters over two million dollars and there was already enough phenol to keep Bayer's Aspirin plant running. Bayer's reputation took a large hit, however, just as the company was preparing to launch an advertising campaign to secure the connection between aspirin and the Bayer brand.<ref name=Jeffreys/>{{rp|113\u2013114}}\n\n===Bayer loses foreign holdings===\nBeginning in 1915, Bayer set up a number of [[shell corporation]]s and subsidiaries in the United States, to hedge against the possibility of losing control of its American assets if the U.S. should enter the war and to allow Bayer to enter other markets (e.g., army uniforms). After the U.S. declared war on Germany in April 1917, [[Alien Property Custodian|alien property custodian]] [[A. Mitchell Palmer]] began investigating German-owned businesses, and soon turned his attention to Bayer. To avoid having to surrender all profits and assets to the government, Bayer's management shifted the stock to a new company, nominally owned by Americans but controlled by the German-American Bayer leaders. Palmer, however, soon uncovered this scheme and seized all of Bayer's American holdings. After the [[Trading with the Enemy Act]] was amended to allow sale of these holdings, the government auctioned off the Rensselaer plant and all Bayer's American patents and trademarks, including even the Bayer brand name and the Bayer cross logo. It was bought by a patent medicine company, [[Sterling Products, Inc.]].<ref name=MannPlummer/>{{rp|42\u201349}} The rights to Bayer Aspirin and the U.S. rights to the Bayer name and trademarks were sold back to Bayer AG in 1994 for US$1 billion.<ref name=ACS/>\n\n==Interwar years==\n[[File:Bayer Aspirin ad, NYT, February 19, 1917.jpg|thumb|Bayer began advertising directly to American consumers just before the expiration of the aspirin patent.

Its fever-reducing properties gave many sick patients enough strength to fight through the infection, and aspirin companies large and small earned the loyalty of doctors and the public\u2014when they could manufacture or purchase enough aspirin to meet demand.

In 1920, [[United Drug Company]] challenged the ''Aspirin'' trademark, which became officially generic for public sale in the U.S. (although it remained trademarked when sold to wholesalers and pharmacists). With demand growing rapidly in the wake of the Spanish flu, there were soon hundreds of \"aspirin\" brands on sale in the United States.<ref name=Jeffreys/>{{rp|151\u2013152}}\n\nSterling Products, equipped with all of Bayer's U.S. intellectual property, tried to take advantage of its new brand as quickly as possible, before generic ASAs took over. However, without German expertise to run the Rensselaer plant to make aspirin and the other Bayer pharmaceuticals, they had only a finite aspirin supply and were facing competition from other companies. Sterling president William E. Weiss had ambitions to sell Bayer aspirin not only in the U.S., but to compete with the German Bayer abroad as well. Taking advantage of the losses [[Farbenfabriken Bayer]] (the German Bayer company) suffered through the [[World War I reparations|reparation provisions]] of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], Weiss worked out a deal with Carl Duisberg to share profits in the Americas, Australia, South Africa and Great Britain for most Bayer drugs, in return for technical assistance in manufacturing the drugs.<ref name=Jeffreys/>{{rp|144\u2013150}}\n\nSterling also took over Bayer's Canadian assets as well as ownership of the Aspirin trademark which is still valid in Canada<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=21289783 |pmc=2306102 |year=1981 |last1=Kiefer |first1=J.

The Australian company Nicholas Proprietary Limited, through the aggressive [[Marketing strategy|marketing strategies]] of George Davies, built ''[[Aspirin|Aspro]]'' into a global brand, with particular strength in Australia, New Zealand, and the U.K.<ref name=Jeffreys/>{{rp|153\u2013161}} American brands such as ''Burton's Aspirin'', ''Molloy's Aspirin'', ''Cal-Aspirin'' and ''St. Joseph Aspirin'' tried to compete with the American Bayer, while new products such ''Cafaspirin'' (aspirin with [[caffeine]]) and ''[[Alka-Seltzer]]'' (a soluble mix of aspirin and [[bicarbonate of soda]]) put aspirin to new uses.<ref name=Jeffreys/>{{rp|161\u2013162}} In 1925, the German Bayer became part of [[IG Farben]], a conglomerate of former dye companies; IG Farben's brands of ''Aspirin'' and, in [[Latin America]], the caffeinated ''Cafiaspirina'' (co-managed with Sterling Products) competed with less expensive aspirins such as ''Geniol''.<ref name=MannPlummer/>{{rp|78,90}}\n\n==Competition from new drugs==\nAfter World War II, with the [[IG Farben]] conglomerate dismantled because of its central role in the [[Nazi]] regime, Sterling Products bought half of Bayer Ltd, the British Bayer subsidiary\u2014the other half of which it already owned. However, ''Bayer Aspirin'' made up only a small fraction of the British aspirin market because of competition from ''Aspro'', ''Disprin'' (a soluble aspirin drug) and other brands. Bayer Ltd began searching for new pain relievers to compete more effectively. After several moderately successful compound drugs that mainly utilized aspirin (''[[Anadin]]'' and ''Excedrin''), Bayer Ltd's manager Laurie Spalton ordered an investigation of a substance that scientists at Yale had, in 1946, found to be the metabolically active derivative of acetanilide: [[acetaminophen]]. After clinical trials, Bayer Ltd brought acetaminophen to market as ''Panadol'' in 1956.<ref name=Jeffreys/>{{rp|205\u2013207}}\n\nHowever, Sterling Products did not market ''Panadol'' in the United States or other countries where ''Bayer Aspirin'' still dominated the aspirin market. Other firms began selling acetaminophen drugs, most significantly, [[McNeil Laboratories]] with liquid ''[[Tylenol (brand)|Tylenol]]'' in 1955, and ''Tylenol'' pills in 1958. By 1967, ''Tylenol'' was available without a prescription. Because it did not cause gastric irritation, acetaminophen rapidly displaced much of aspirin's sales. Another analgesic, anti-inflammatory drug was introduced in 1962: [[ibuprofen]] (sold as ''Brufen'' in the U.K. and ''Motrin'' in the U.S.). By the 1970s, aspirin had a relatively small portion of the pain reliever market, and in the 1980s sales decreased even more when ibuprofen became available without prescription.<ref name=Jeffreys/>{{rp|212\u2013217}}\n\nAlso in the early 1980s, several studies suggested a link between children's consumption of aspirin and [[Reye's syndrome]], a potentially fatal disease. By 1986, the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] required [[warning label]]s on all aspirin, further suppressing sales. The makers of ''Tylenol'' also filed a lawsuit against ''Anacin'' aspirin maker [[American Home Products]], claiming that the failure to add warning labels before 1986 had unfairly held back ''Tylenol'' sales, though this suit was eventually dismissed.<ref name=MannPlummer/>{{rp|228\u2013229}}\n\n==Investigating how aspirin works==\n{{See also|Mechanism of action of aspirin}}\nThe mechanism of aspirin's analgesic, anti-inflammatory and [[antipyretic]] properties was unknown through the drug's heyday in the early- to mid-twentieth century; Heinrich Dreser's explanation, widely accepted since the drug was first brought to market, was that aspirin relieved pain by acting on the [[central nervous system]]. In 1958 Harry Collier, a biochemist in the London laboratory of pharmaceutical company [[Parke-Davis]], began investigating the relationship between [[Kinin-kallikrein system|kinins]] and the effects of aspirin. In tests on [[guinea pig]]s, Collier found that aspirin, if given beforehand, inhibited the [[bronchoconstriction]] effects of [[bradykinin]]. He found that cutting the guinea pigs' [[vagus nerve]] did not affect the action of bradykinin ''or'' the inhibitory effect of aspirin\u2014evidence that aspirin worked locally to combat pain and inflammation, rather than on the central nervous system. In 1963, Collier began working with [[University of London]] pharmacology graduate student Priscilla Piper to determine the precise mechanism of aspirin's effects. However, it was difficult to pin down the precise biochemical goings-on in live research animals, and ''[[in vitro]]'' tests on removed animal tissues did not behave like ''[[in vivo]]'' tests.<ref name=Jeffreys/>{{rp|223\u2013226}}\n\nAfter five years of collaboration, Collier arranged for Piper to work with pharmacologist [[John Vane]] at the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England]], in order to learn Vane's new [[bioassay]] methods, which seemed like a possible solution to the ''in vitro'' testing failures. Vane and Piper tested the [[biochemical cascade]] associated with [[anaphylactic shock]] (in extracts from guinea pig lungs, applied to tissue from [[rabbit]] [[aorta]]s). They found that aspirin inhibited the release of an unidentified chemical generated by guinea pig lungs, a chemical that caused rabbit tissue to contract. By 1971, Vane identified the chemical (which they called \"rabbit-aorta contracting substance,\" or RCS) as a [[prostaglandin]]. In a 23 June 1971 paper in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', Vane and Piper suggested that aspirin and similar drugs (the [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s or NSAIDs) worked by blocking the production of prostaglandins. Later research showed that NSAIDs such as aspirin worked by inhibiting [[cyclooxygenase]], the enzyme responsible for converting [[arachidonic acid]] into a prostaglandin.<ref name=Jeffreys/>{{rp|226\u2013231}}\n\n==Revival as heart drug==\nAspirin's effects on [[Coagulation|blood clotting]] (as an [[antiplatelet agent]]) were first noticed in 1950 by [[Lawrence Craven]]. Craven, a [[family doctor]] in California, had been directing [[tonsillectomy]] patients to chew [[Aspergum]], an aspirin-laced [[chewing gum]]. He found that an unusual number of patients had to be hospitalized for severe bleeding, and that those patients had been using very high amounts of Aspergum. Craven began recommending daily aspirin to all his patients, and claimed that the patients who followed the aspirin regimen (about 8,000 people) had no signs of [[thrombosis]]. However, Craven's studies were not taken seriously by the medical community, because he had not done a [[placebo]]-[[scientific control|controlled]] study and had published only in obscure journals.<ref name=Jeffreys/>{{rp|237\u2013239}} <ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Miner J, Hoffhines A |title=The discovery of aspirin's antithrombotic effects |journal=Tex Heart Inst J |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=179\u201386 |year=2007 |pmid=17622365 |pmc=1894700}}</ref>\n\nThe idea of using aspirin to prevent clotting diseases (such as heart attacks and strokes) was revived in the 1960s, when medical researcher Harvey Weiss found that aspirin had an anti-adhesive effect on [[Platelet|blood platelets]] (and unlike other potential antiplatelet drugs, aspirin had low toxicity). [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]] haematologist John O'Brien picked up on Weiss's finding and, in 1963, began working with epidemiologist Peter Elwood on aspirin's anti-thrombosis drug potential. Elwood began a large-scale trial of aspirin as a preventive drug for heart attacks. Nicholas Laboratories agreed to provide aspirin tablets, and Elwood enlisted heart attack survivors in a [[Blind experiment|double-blind]] controlled study\u2014heart attack survivors were statistically more likely to suffer a second attack, greatly reducing the number of patients necessary to reliably detect whether aspirin had an effect on heart attacks. The study began in February 1971, though the researchers soon had to break the double-blinding when a study by American epidemiologist [[Hershel Jick]] suggested that aspirin prevented heart attacks but suggested that the heart attacks were more deadly.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D9eRDgAAQBAJ&pg=PT491|page=491|title=The Chemical Century: Molecular Manipulation and Its Impact on the 20th Century|first=Richard J.|last=Sundberg|publisher=CRC|year=2017|isbn=9781315342030}}</ref> Jick had found that fewer aspirin-takers were admitted to his hospital for heart attacks than non-aspirin-takers, and one possible explanation was that aspirin caused heart attack sufferers to die before reaching the hospital; Elwood's initial results ruled out that explanation. When the Elwood trial ended in 1973, it showed a modest but not [[Statistical significance|statistically significant]] reduction in heart attacks among the group taking aspirin.<ref name=Jeffreys/>{{rp|239\u2013246}}\n\nSeveral subsequent studies put aspirin's effectiveness as a heart drug on firmer ground, but the evidence was not incontrovertible. However, in the mid-1980s, with the relatively new technique of [[meta-analysis]], statistician [[Richard Peto]] convinced the U.S. FDA and much of the medical community that the aspirin studies, in aggregate, showed aspirin's effectiveness with relative certainty.<ref name=Jeffreys/>{{rp|247\u2013257}} By the end of the 1980s, aspirin was widely used as a preventive drug for heart attacks and had regained its former position as the top-selling analgesic in the U.S.<ref name=Jeffreys/>{{rp|267\u2013269}}\n\nIn 2018, three major clinical trials cast doubt on that conventional wisdom, finding few benefits and consistent bleeding risks associated with daily aspirin use. Taken together, the findings led the [[American Heart Association]] and [[American College of Cardiology]] to change clinical practice guidelines in early 2019, recommending against the routine use of aspirin in people older than 70 years or people with increased bleeding risk who do not have existing cardiovascular disease.<ref>[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/07/190722182126.htm \"Widespread aspirin use despite few benefits, high risks.\"], Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.

The primary feature of an AR relationship is whether a person ranks above or below each other person. Those higher in rank hold greater authority, prestige and privileges, while subordinates are entitled to guidance and protection. Military ranks are a prototypical example of an AR relationship.<ref name=\"Fiske1992\" />\n* '''Equality matching (EM)''' relationships are those characterized by various forms of one-for-one correspondence, such as turn taking, in-kind [[Norm of reciprocity|reciprocity]], tit-for-tat retaliation, or eye-for-an-eye revenge. Parties in EM relationships are primarily concerned with ensuring the relationship is in a balanced state. Non-intimate acquaintances are a prototypical example.<ref name=\"Fiske1992\" />\n* '''Market pricing (MP)''' relationships revolve around a model of proportionality where people attend to ratios and rates and relevant features are typically reduced to a single value or utility metric that allows the comparison (e.g., the price of a sale). Monetary transactions are a prototypical example of MP relationships.<ref name=\"Fiske1992\" />\n\n===Meta-relational models===\n\n{{Quotebox|align=right|width=40%|quoted=1|quote= We cannot understand individual psychology, dyadic social relationships, or group psychology unless we understand the combinatorics of social relationships.

And some relationships ''preclude'' certain other relationships.|source=\u2014Alan Fiske on meta-relational models<ref name= Fiske2012/>}}\n\nThe four elementary relationships can be combined to form more complex configurations of relationships called meta-relational models.<ref name=\"Fiske2012\">{{cite journal |last1=Fiske |first1=Alan Page |title=Metarelational models: Configurations of social relationships |journal=European Journal of Social Psychology |date=February 2012 |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=2\u201318 |doi=10.1002/ejsp.847 }}</ref> Meta-relational models typically take the form of ''entailments'' or ''prohibitions'', which imply certain obligations, behaviors or relationships between [[Dyad (sociology)|dyads]] within the configuration (e.g., A being in a CS relationship with B prohibits B from being in a CS relationship with A's enemy, C). Examples of meta-relational models include the [[compadrazgo]] relationship, describing the entailment of relationships between the parents and godparents of a child, and the [[incest taboo]], describing the prohibition of relationships among certain members of the same family.<ref name= Fiske2012/>\n\n===Relational models as an explanation of interpersonal conflict===\nAccording to RMT, mis-matching of relational models is a common cause of interpersonal [[Conflict (process)|conflict]], given that different relational models will often imply different behaviors in the same situation. Taking two housemates sharing dishwashing as a simple example, Fiske suggests<ref name=\"Fiske2007\" /> that if housemate A assumes dishwashing is governed by a CS framework and housemate B assumes an EM framework, A will expect both of them to wash dishes whenever they can, and B will expect them to take turns. If A is busy and B is not, A will expect B to wash the dishes, but if B washed the dishes last, they'll assume it's A's turn, and conflict will ensue because of A and B's mis-matched relational models.\n\n===Correspondence between relational models and Stevens's levels of measurement===\nFiske proposed that the four discrete types of relationships correspond to Stevens's four [[levels of measurement]].<ref name=\"Fiske1992\" /> CS relationships resemble the categorical (nominal) scales of measurement in that all members of the relationship are equivalent. AR resembles an ordinal scale given that members of the relationship are placed in a linear ordering. EM relationships resemble interval measurement given that they are kept in balance by addition and subtraction. Finally, MP relationships resemble a ratio scale (whose origin corresponds, for example, to a price of zero) given that they involve proportions, multiplication and division and the distributive law.\n\n==Influence==\nThe two main, original publications on Relational Models Theory<ref name=\"Fiske1992\" /><ref name=\"Fiske1991\" /> have been cited over 4000 times.\n\n===In moral psychology===\nRelational Models Theory has had wide-ranging influence throughout the field of [[moral psychology]].

The primary feature of an AR relationship is whether a person ranks above or below each other person. Those higher in rank hold greater authority, prestige and privileges, while subordinates are entitled to guidance and protection. Military ranks are a prototypical example of an AR relationship.<ref name=\"Fiske1992\" />\n* '''Equality matching (EM)''' relationships are those characterized by various forms of one-for-one correspondence, such as turn taking, in-kind [[Norm of reciprocity|reciprocity]], tit-for-tat retaliation, or eye-for-an-eye revenge. Parties in EM relationships are primarily concerned with ensuring the relationship is in a balanced state. Non-intimate acquaintances are a prototypical example.<ref name=\"Fiske1992\" />\n* '''Market pricing (MP)''' relationships revolve around a model of proportionality where people attend to ratios and rates and relevant features are typically reduced to a single value or utility metric that allows the comparison (e.g., the price of a sale). Monetary transactions are a prototypical example of MP relationships.<ref name=\"Fiske1992\" />\n\n===Meta-relational models===\n\n{{Quotebox|align=right|width=40%|quoted=1|quote= We cannot understand individual psychology, dyadic social relationships, or group psychology unless we understand the combinatorics of social relationships. There are \u201csyntactical\u201d models for conjoining relationships, including models whereby particular relationships ''entail'' other specific relationships. And some relationships ''preclude'' certain other relationships.|source=\u2014Alan Fiske on meta-relational models<ref name= Fiske2012/>}}\n\nThe four elementary relationships can be combined to form more complex configurations of relationships called meta-relational models.<ref name=\"Fiske2012\">{{cite journal |last1=Fiske |first1=Alan Page |title=Metarelational models: Configurations of social relationships |journal=European Journal of Social Psychology |date=February 2012 |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=2\u201318 |doi=10.1002/ejsp.847 }}</ref> Meta-relational models typically take the form of ''entailments'' or ''prohibitions'', which imply certain obligations, behaviors or relationships between [[Dyad (sociology)|dyads]] within the configuration (e.g., A being in a CS relationship with B prohibits B from being in a CS relationship with A's enemy, C). Examples of meta-relational models include the [[compadrazgo]] relationship, describing the entailment of relationships between the parents and godparents of a child, and the [[incest taboo]], describing the prohibition of relationships among certain members of the same family.<ref name= Fiske2012/>\n\n===Relational models as an explanation of interpersonal conflict===\nAccording to RMT, mis-matching of relational models is a common cause of interpersonal [[Conflict (process)|conflict]], given that different relational models will often imply different behaviors in the same situation. Taking two housemates sharing dishwashing as a simple example, Fiske suggests<ref name=\"Fiske2007\" /> that if housemate A assumes dishwashing is governed by a CS framework and housemate B assumes an EM framework, A will expect both of them to wash dishes whenever they can, and B will expect them to take turns. If A is busy and B is not, A will expect B to wash the dishes, but if B washed the dishes last, they'll assume it's A's turn, and conflict will ensue because of A and B's mis-matched relational models.\n\n===Correspondence between relational models and Stevens's levels of measurement===\nFiske proposed that the four discrete types of relationships correspond to Stevens's four [[levels of measurement]].<ref name=\"Fiske1992\" /> CS relationships resemble the categorical (nominal) scales of measurement in that all members of the relationship are equivalent. AR resembles an ordinal scale given that members of the relationship are placed in a linear ordering. EM relationships resemble interval measurement given that they are kept in balance by addition and subtraction. Finally, MP relationships resemble a ratio scale (whose origin corresponds, for example, to a price of zero) given that they involve proportions, multiplication and division and the distributive law.\n\n==Influence==\nThe two main, original publications on Relational Models Theory<ref name=\"Fiske1992\" /><ref name=\"Fiske1991\" /> have been cited over 4000 times.\n\n===In moral psychology===\nThe theory has also been extended to explain moral judgments in the context of interpersonal relationships in the form of Relationship Regulation Theory,<ref name=\"Rai2011\">{{cite journal |last1=Rai |first1=Tage Shakti |last2=Fiske |first2=Alan Page |title=Moral psychology is relationship regulation: Moral motives for unity, hierarchy, equality, and proportionality. |journal=Psychological Review |date=2011 |volume=118 |issue=1 |pages=57\u201375 |doi=10.1037/a0021867 |pmid=21244187}}</ref> describing the way in which people will judge similar actions differently depending on the relational context in which the act occurs.<ref name=\"Simpson2016\">{{cite journal |last1=Simpson |first1=Ain |last2=Laham |first2=Simon M. |last3=Fiske |first3=Alan Page |title=Wrongness in different relationships: Relational context effects on moral judgment |journal=The Journal of Social Psychology |date=11 January 2016 |volume=156 |issue=6 |pages=594\u2013609 |doi=10.1080/00224545.2016.1140118}}</ref> Relational Models Theory has also been used to explain interpersonal [[violence]] in the form of Virtuous Violence Theory,<ref name=\"Fiske2014\">{{cite book |last1=Fiske |first1=Alan Page |last2=Rai |first2=Tage Shakti |title=Virtuous Violence: Hurting and Killing to Create, Sustain, End, and Honor Social Relationships |date=2014 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9781316104668 |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/virtuous-violence/0BC95A5426105D04AD30DF7EFA1C0739}}</ref> and as a building block of one of the more prominent theories in [[moral psychology]], [[moral foundations theory]].<ref name=\"Haidt2004\">{{cite journal |last1=Haidt |first1=Jonathan |last2=Joseph |first2=Craig |title=Intuitive ethics: how innately prepared intuitions generate culturally variable virtues |journal=Daedalus |date=September 2004 |volume=133 |issue=4 |pages=55\u201366 |doi=10.1162/0011526042365555}}</ref>\n\n===In other areas===\nRMT has been influential in the development of [[Steven Pinker|Steven Pinker's]] theory of [[indirect speech]],<ref name=\"Pinker2008\">{{cite journal |last1=Pinker |first1=S. |last2=Nowak |first2=M.

The highway runs {{convert|12.40|mi|km}} from [[Maryland Route 28|MD 28]] near [[Dawsonville, Maryland|Dawsonville]] east to West Diamond Avenue next to [[Maryland Route 355|MD 355]] in [[Gaithersburg, Maryland|Gaithersburg]]. MD 117 is an L-shaped highway that connects the rural western [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]] communities of Dawsonville and [[Boyds, Maryland|Boyds]] with [[Germantown, Maryland|Germantown]], Gaithersburg, and [[Interstate 270 (Maryland)|Interstate 270]] (I-270) in the suburban central part of the county. The highway also provides access to [[Seneca Creek State Park]], the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]], and several commuter rail stations along [[MARC Train|MARC]]'s [[Brunswick Line]], which the highway parallels. MD 117 was the inspiration for the 1971 hit song \"[[Take Me Home, Country Roads]]\".\n\nMD 117 originally consisted of three disjoint segments. The segment from MD 28 to west of Boyds was built in the early 1910s and extended to Boyds in the late 1920s. The two other segments were built west from Germantown and west from [[Maryland Route 124|MD 124]] in Gaithersburg in the early 1930s. MD 117 east of MD 124 was originally part of the latter highway, which was constructed in the early 1910s. The two gaps in MD 117 were filled in the early to mid-1950s before the route between Boyds and Gaithersburg was transferred to county maintenance in the late 1950s. MD 117 was returned to its course from Boyds to Gaithersburg in the mid-1970s and extended to downtown Gaithersburg over what had been MD 124 in the 1980s. The highway was expanded to a four- to six-lane [[divided highway]] in parts of Germantown and Gaithersburg by the late 1990s.\n\n==Route description==\n[[File:2016-10-13 11 14 12 View east along Maryland State Route 117 (Barnesville Road) at Slidell Road in Blocktown, Montgomery County, Maryland.jpg|thumb|right|View east along MD 117 in Blocktown]]\nMD 117 begins at an intersection with MD 28 (Darnestown Road) between Dawsonville and [[Beallsville, Maryland|Beallsville]]. The highway heads north as two-lane undivided Bucklodge Road past the historic home [[Friends Advice]], then curves northeast and crosses Bucklodge Branch. MD 117 passes under [[CSX Transportation|CSX]]'s [[Metropolitan Subdivision]], which carries MARC's Brunswick Line. The highway curves southeast at its tangent junction with Barnesville Road and assumes that name as it approaches the village of Boyds. At the southern end of [[Maryland Route 121|MD 121]] (Clarksburg Road), MD 117 turns south onto Clarksburg Road and passes under the railroad again adjacent to the [[Boyds station]] serving MARC. Just south of the railroad, the highway turns east onto Clopper Road, which parallels the railroad then veers away southeast and crosses [[Little Seneca Creek]].<ref name=\"Maryland HLR\"/><ref name=\"Google Maps MD 117\"/>\n\nEast of Little Seneca Creek, MD 117 enters the suburban area of Germantown. The highway expands to a four-lane divided highway at [[Kingsview Middle School]] and intersects [[Maryland Route 118|MD 118]] (Germantown Road), the main street through Germantown that serves the [[Germantown station (MARC)|Germantown MARC station]]. MD 117 gains a third eastbound lane to [[Maryland Route 119|MD 119]] (Great Seneca Highway), where the divided highway ends and soon drops to two lanes as it leaves Germantown. The highway crosses [[Great Seneca Creek]] and passes an entrance to Seneca Creek State Park. MD 117 expands to a four-lane undivided highway as it enters the city of Gaithersburg. The highway intersects Metropolitan Grove Road, which leads to the [[Metropolitan Grove station|eponymous MARC station]]. MD 117 expands to a six-lane divided highway west of its intersection with MD 124 (Quince Orchard Road). The highway continues east as West Diamond Avenue along the northern edge of an [[unincorporated area|unincorporated]] [[enclave]] within the city of Gaithersburg. The enclave contains the campus of the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]], whose main entrance is along MD 117 east of MD 124.<ref name=\"Maryland HLR\"/><ref name=\"Google Maps MD 117\"/>\n\nEast of the federal agency's campus, MD 117 has a partial interchange with I-270 (Eisenhower Memorial Highway). The interchange consists of a straight ramp from the state highway to southbound I-270 and a loop ramp from northbound I-270 to MD 117. Connections with I-270 in the direction of [[Frederick, Maryland|Frederick]] are made via the freeway's interchange with MD 124 to the north. A [[park and ride]] lot is located within the loop ramp from northbound I-270. MD 117 drops to three lanes through the interchange, then expands to a four-lane divided highway again at Perry Parkway. The highway passes south of [[The Avalon School]] before it fully re-enters the city of Gaithersburg at its junction with Muddy Branch Road, east of which the highway drops to two lanes and reaches its eastern terminus at [[#Auxiliary route|MD 117A]], an [[unsigned highway|unsigned]] connector between MD 117 and southbound MD 355 (Frederick Avenue). West Diamond Avenue continues east as a city street that parallels the Metropolitan Subdivision rail line under MD 355. West Diamond Avenue becomes Old Towne Avenue, which intersects Fulks Corner Road&mdash;which provides access to northbound MD 355&mdash;on its way to downtown Gaithersburg and the [[Gaithersburg station|Gaithersburg MARC station]].<ref name=\"Maryland HLR\"/><ref name=\"Google Maps MD 117\"/>\n\nMD 117 is a part of the [[National Highway System (United States)|National Highway System]] as a principal arterial between MD 118 and MD 119 in Germantown.<ref name=\"Maryland HLR\"/><ref name=\"National Highway System\"/>\n\n==Cultural significance==\nWhat is today MD 117 was the inspiration for [[John Denver]]'s hit song \"[[Take Me Home, Country Roads]],\" a song now associated with [[West Virginia]]. Songwriters [[Bill Danoff]] and [[Taffy Nivert]], who later formed the [[Starland Vocal Band]], wrote much of \"Take Me Home, Country Roads\" in December 1970 while working in [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.|Georgetown]]. Danoff and Nivert showed the song to Denver, who helped them finish writing the song. The song was inspired by a drive along Clopper Road to a family reunion in Gaithersburg.

The highway runs {{convert|12.40|mi|km}} from [[Maryland Route 28|MD 28]] near [[Dawsonville, Maryland|Dawsonville]] east to West Diamond Avenue next to [[Maryland Route 355|MD 355]] in [[Gaithersburg, Maryland|Gaithersburg]]. MD 117 is an L-shaped highway that connects the rural western [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]] communities of Dawsonville and [[Boyds, Maryland|Boyds]] with [[Germantown, Maryland|Germantown]], Gaithersburg, and [[Interstate 270 (Maryland)|Interstate 270]] (I-270) in the suburban central part of the county. The highway also provides access to [[Seneca Creek State Park]], the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]], and several commuter rail stations along [[MARC Train|MARC]]'s [[Brunswick Line]], which the highway parallels. MD 117 was the inspiration for the 1971 hit song \"[[Take Me Home, Country Roads]]\".\n\nMD 117 originally consisted of three disjoint segments. The segment from MD 28 to west of Boyds was built in the early 1910s and extended to Boyds in the late 1920s. The two other segments were built west from Germantown and west from [[Maryland Route 124|MD 124]] in Gaithersburg in the early 1930s. MD 117 east of MD 124 was originally part of the latter highway, which was constructed in the early 1910s. The two gaps in MD 117 were filled in the early to mid-1950s before the route between Boyds and Gaithersburg was transferred to county maintenance in the late 1950s. MD 117 was returned to its course from Boyds to Gaithersburg in the mid-1970s and extended to downtown Gaithersburg over what had been MD 124 in the 1980s. The highway was expanded to a four- to six-lane [[divided highway]] in parts of Germantown and Gaithersburg by the late 1990s.\n\n==Route description==\n[[File:2016-10-13 11 14 12 View east along Maryland State Route 117 (Barnesville Road) at Slidell Road in Blocktown, Montgomery County, Maryland.jpg|thumb|right|View east along MD 117 in Blocktown]]\nMD 117 begins at an intersection with MD 28 (Darnestown Road) between Dawsonville and [[Beallsville, Maryland|Beallsville]]. The highway heads north as two-lane undivided Bucklodge Road past the historic home [[Friends Advice]], then curves northeast and crosses Bucklodge Branch. MD 117 passes under [[CSX Transportation|CSX]]'s [[Metropolitan Subdivision]], which carries MARC's Brunswick Line. The highway curves southeast at its tangent junction with Barnesville Road and assumes that name as it approaches the village of Boyds. At the southern end of [[Maryland Route 121|MD 121]] (Clarksburg Road), MD 117 turns south onto Clarksburg Road and passes under the railroad again adjacent to the [[Boyds station]] serving MARC. Just south of the railroad, the highway turns east onto Clopper Road, which parallels the railroad then veers away southeast and crosses [[Little Seneca Creek]].<ref name=\"Maryland HLR\"/><ref name=\"Google Maps MD 117\"/>\n\nEast of Little Seneca Creek, MD 117 enters the suburban area of Germantown. The highway expands to a four-lane divided highway at [[Kingsview Middle School]] and intersects [[Maryland Route 118|MD 118]] (Germantown Road), the main street through Germantown that serves the [[Germantown station (MARC)|Germantown MARC station]]. MD 117 gains a third eastbound lane to [[Maryland Route 119|MD 119]] (Great Seneca Highway), where the divided highway ends and soon drops to two lanes as it leaves Germantown. The highway crosses [[Great Seneca Creek]] and passes an entrance to Seneca Creek State Park. MD 117 expands to a four-lane undivided highway as it enters the city of Gaithersburg. The highway intersects Metropolitan Grove Road, which leads to the [[Metropolitan Grove station|eponymous MARC station]]. MD 117 expands to a six-lane divided highway west of its intersection with MD 124 (Quince Orchard Road). The highway continues east as West Diamond Avenue along the northern edge of an [[unincorporated area|unincorporated]] [[enclave]] within the city of Gaithersburg. The enclave contains the campus of the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]], whose main entrance is along MD 117 east of MD 124.<ref name=\"Maryland HLR\"/><ref name=\"Google Maps MD 117\"/>\n\nEast of the federal agency's campus, MD 117 has a partial interchange with I-270 (Eisenhower Memorial Highway). The interchange consists of a straight ramp from the state highway to southbound I-270 and a loop ramp from northbound I-270 to MD 117. Connections with I-270 in the direction of [[Frederick, Maryland|Frederick]] are made via the freeway's interchange with MD 124 to the north. A [[park and ride]] lot is located within the loop ramp from northbound I-270. MD 117 drops to three lanes through the interchange, then expands to a four-lane divided highway again at Perry Parkway. The highway passes south of [[The Avalon School]] before it fully re-enters the city of Gaithersburg at its junction with Muddy Branch Road, east of which the highway drops to two lanes and reaches its eastern terminus at [[#Auxiliary route|MD 117A]], an [[unsigned highway|unsigned]] connector between MD 117 and southbound MD 355 (Frederick Avenue). West Diamond Avenue continues east as a city street that parallels the Metropolitan Subdivision rail line under MD 355. West Diamond Avenue becomes Old Towne Avenue, which intersects Fulks Corner Road&mdash;which provides access to northbound MD 355&mdash;on its way to downtown Gaithersburg and the [[Gaithersburg station|Gaithersburg MARC station]].<ref name=\"Maryland HLR\"/><ref name=\"Google Maps MD 117\"/>\n\nMD 117 is a part of the [[National Highway System (United States)|National Highway System]] as a principal arterial between MD 118 and MD 119 in Germantown.<ref name=\"Maryland HLR\"/><ref name=\"National Highway System\"/>\n\n==Cultural significance==\nWhat is today MD 117 was the inspiration for [[John Denver]]'s hit song \"[[Take Me Home, Country Roads]],\" a song now associated with [[West Virginia]]. Songwriters [[Bill Danoff]] and [[Taffy Nivert]], who later formed the [[Starland Vocal Band]], wrote much of \"Take Me Home, Country Roads\" in December 1970 while working in [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.|Georgetown]]. Danoff and Nivert showed the song to Denver, who helped them finish writing the song. The song was inspired by a drive along Clopper Road to a family reunion in Gaithersburg. Denver, Danoff, and Nivert first performed the song December 30, 1970, at [[The Cellar Door]] in Georgetown. \"Take Me Home, Country Roads\" became Denver's first major hit after he recorded it in 1971.<ref name=\"Washington Post Denver\"/>\n\n==History==\nThe first segment of MD 117 constructed was from the modern MD 117&ndash;MD 124 intersection east of Gaithersburg.<ref name=\"1911 map\"/> This segment was one of the original state roads planned by the [[Maryland State Roads Commission]] in 1909; the highway later became part of MD 124.<ref name=\"1910 map\"/><ref name=\"1933 map\"/> This highway was constructed as a {{convert|14|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} [[macadam road]] west of Gaithersburg in 1911 and 1912 and within the town of Gaithersburg in 1914.<ref name=\"1911 map\"/><ref name=\"1915 src report\"/> Bucklodge Road from MD 28 near Dawsonville north to the [[Baltimore & Ohio Railroad]] (now CSX) was constructed as a {{convert|9|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} macadam road by Montgomery County with state aid by 1915.<ref name=\"1915 src report\"/> Bucklodge Road was extended as a concrete road to the underpass of the railroad at Boyds east of the southern end of MD 121 in 1928.<ref name=\"1928 map\"/> A disjoint segment of macadam road was laid from MD 118 at Old Germantown west to Schaeffer Road in 1930 and extended west to near Little Seneca Creek by 1933.<ref name=\"1930 map\"/><ref name=\"1933 map\"/> A third section of macadam road was also built from the modern MD 117&ndash;MD 124 intersection west to the hamlet of Clopper east of Great Seneca Creek by 1933.<ref name=\"1933 map\"/> All three segments were later marked as MD 117.<ref name=\"1939 map\"/>\n\n[[File:2007 11 01 - 117@121 - Looking SW 2.JPG|left|thumb|MD 117's underpass of CSX's Metropolitan Subdivision rail line viewed from the highway's junction with MD 121 at Boyds]]\nMD 117 was widened from {{convert|12|to|20|ft|m}} from Old Germantown to Little Seneca Creek in 1948.<ref name=\"1948 src report\"/> The gap between Old Germantown and Clopper was filled with a modern highway, including the modern bridge across Great Seneca Creek, and was brought into the state highway system in 1951 and 1952.<ref name=\"1952 src report\"/><ref name=\"NBI Great Seneca Creek\"/> MD 117 became a single highway when the county highway between Boyds and Old Germantown was brought into the state highway system in 1956.<ref name=\"1956 map\"/> However, in 1959, MD 117's eastern terminus was rolled back to the railroad crossing at Boyds.<ref name=\"1959 map\"/> The highway between Boyds and MD 124 west of Gaithersburg was brought back into the state highway system in 1974.<ref name=\"1974 map\"/> The following year, MD 124 was rerouted north along Quince Orchard Road through a [[cloverleaf interchange]] with I-270 to MD 355, then southeast concurrent with MD 355 to rejoin its old alignment in downtown Gaithersburg.<ref name=\"1975 map\"/> West Diamond Avenue from MD 124 to MD 355 was assigned MD 924.<ref name=\"1981 map\"/> By 1987, the MD 924 designation was removed&mdash;to be used on [[Maryland Route 924|its current course]] in [[Harford County, Maryland|Harford County]]&mdash;and replaced with an extension of MD 117.<ref name=\"1987 map\"/>\n\nMD 117's partial interchange with I-270 was constructed in 1987; to that point, MD 117's access to I-270 had been indirect via the Interstate's interchange with Quince Orchard Road, which had been built as a county highway concurrent with the freeway in 1956.<ref name=\"1956 map\"/><ref name=\"1961 map\"/> MD 117 was expanded to a divided highway from west of MD 118 to MD 119 in Germantown and on either side of its intersection with MD 124 in Gaithersburg by 1999.<ref name=\"Maryland HLR 1999\"/> Since at least 1950, West Diamond Avenue had passed under MD 355's bridge across the railroad and met that highway at an oblique intersection.<ref name=\"USGS Gaithersburg 1950\"/> In 1987, MD 355's bridge was replaced with the present bridge and the oblique intersection was replaced with a more gentle curve and right-in/right-out interchange with northbound MD 355.<ref name=\"1987 map\"/> In 1991, access to southbound MD 355 was added via what is now MD 117A.<ref name=\"1991 map\"/> In 2003, the right-in/right-out interchange with northbound MD 355 was removed.
