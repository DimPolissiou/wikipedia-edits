During an 18-year baseball career, he played from 1975 to 1992 for six different teams, most notably the [[New York Yankees]] with whom he won back-to-back world titles against the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]]. He has joined [[ESPN]] as a post-season baseball analyst, beginning in September 2013. Mainly, he appeared on [[Baseball Tonight]] and provided updates during Monday and Wednesday night September network telecasts.\n\nAt the end of his playing career, he ranked fifth in major league history in games at second base (2,152), ninth in [[putout]]s (4,859), seventh in [[assist (baseball)|assists]] (6,336), eighth in [[total chances]] (11,429), and third in [[double play]]s (1,547).  Upon retiring as a player, he joined the Yankees as a coach for 11 years.  He later served as manager of the [[New York Mets]] from 2005 to June 2008, leading the Mets to a league-best record and NLCS in 2006.\n\n==Playing career==\nRandolph grew up in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and graduated from [[Samuel J. Tilden High School]], where he was a star athlete and was drafted by the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] in the 7th round of the 1972 draft. He made his major league debut in 1975, and was, at age 21, the sixth-youngest player in the [[National League]].\n\n[[File:Willie Randolph.jpg|thumb|left|Randolph with the Mets]]\nIn December 1975 he was traded by the Pirates with [[Ken Brett]] and [[Dock Ellis]] to the Yankees for [[Doc Medich]].<ref name=\"googlenews\">{{cite web | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=d3sjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=f9YEAAAAIBAJ&pg=1081,2130255 | title=December 12, 1975 | publisher=Google Newspaper | accessdate=August 11, 2014}}</ref>\n\nRandolph spent 13 of his 18 seasons as a player with the Yankees and was co-captain of the Yankees with Ron Guidry from 1986 to 1988.  He later played for the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] (1989\u201390), [[Oakland Athletics]] (1990), and [[Milwaukee Brewers]] (1991), finishing his career with the [[New York Mets]] in 1992. He was selected to six [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] teams over his career. As a career number 2 hitter in the order, he made use of his skills as [[bunt (baseball)|bunter]] and a patient hitter who drew more than 80 [[base on balls|walks]] seven times.\n\nRandolph was also an outstanding defensive player, known especially for his ability to turn the [[double play]]. However, he never received the [[Gold Glove Award]], which was perennially awarded to his equally sure-handed and more acrobatic and wide-ranging contemporaries: [[Frank White (baseball)|Frank White]] of the [[Kansas City Royals]] and [[Lou Whitaker]] of the [[Detroit Tigers]]. He was the Yankees' starting second baseman on the [[1977 World Series|1977]] and [[1978 World Series]] Championship teams.\n\nIn 1980 Randolph led the league in walks (119) and was second in the AL in [[on-base percentage]] (.427), eighth in [[stolen base]]s (30) and ninth in [[run (baseball)|runs]] (99), and won the [[Silver Slugger Award]] at second base in the AL. He also batted .332 leading off the inning, and .340 with men in scoring position.\n\nIn 1987 he batted .305 and led the league in at bats per strikeout (18.0), and was fourth in the AL in OBP (.411) and ninth in walks (82). He also batted .366 in tie games, and .345 in games that were late and close.\n\nIn December 1988 he signed as a [[free agent]] with the Los Angeles Dodgers. Randolph led the Dodgers in batting average and hits in 1989, making his sixth All-Star team. In May 1990 he was traded by the Dodgers to the defending-world champion Oakland Athletics for [[Stan Javier]]. Later that year, Randolph and the A's won the American League pennant, but were swept by the NL-champion Cincinnati Reds in the World Series.\n\nIn April 1991 he signed as a free agent with the Milwaukee Brewers. That year, Randolph was second in the AL on-base percentage (.424) and third in batting average (.327). He batted .373 with runners in scoring position.\n\nIn December 1991 he signed as a free agent with the New York Mets. In 1992, at 37 years old he was the eighth-oldest player in the NL. In his last career game with the Mets, the team's second baseman of the future [[Jeff Kent]] moved to make his start at [[shortstop]] to allow Randolph to play his final game at second base.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n==Coaching and managing career==\nRandolph was a Yankees base and bench coach for 11 seasons, interviewing intermittently for managing jobs with other teams. In 2004, Randolph was named Mets manager for the [[2005 in baseball|2005 season]], despite never having managed before at any level of baseball. He became the eighth person to play for and later manage the Mets, joining [[Gil Hodges]], [[Yogi Berra]], [[Joe Torre]], [[Bud Harrelson]], [[Roy McMillan]], [[Dallas Green (baseball)|Dallas Green]], and [[Bobby Valentine]] (as well as [[interim|interim manager]] [[Mike Cubbage]]).{{ref|a}} <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/NYM/|title=New York Mets Team History & Encyclopedia \u2013 Baseball-Reference.com}}</ref> Randolph earned his first win as a manager on April 10, 2005, defeating the [[Atlanta Braves]] 2\u20131.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/NYM/2005_sched.shtml|title=2005 New York Mets Schedule, Box Scores and Splits|work=Baseball-Reference.com}}</ref> The win halted a five-game losing streak to start the 2005 season. He then guided the Mets to five straight additional victories, giving the Mets their first six-game winning streak since August 2003.\nRandolph ended his first season as manager of the 2005 Mets with an 83\u201379 record, the first time the franchise had finished above .500 since 2001, and 12 games better than the prior season. That record got them a tie for third place in the [[National League East]].\n\n[[File:Willie Randolph Milwaukee Brewers Bench Coach.jpg|thumb|right|Randolph with the Brewers]]\nIn 2006, Randolph managed the Mets to a league-best 97\u201365 record (which also tied for the best record in the majors with the crosstown Yankees) and the NL East Division title (the team's first division championship since 1988). The Mets came within one game of reaching the World Series, losing the seventh game of the [[2006 National League Championship Series|NL Championship Series]] to the eventual world champion [[St. Louis Cardinals]]. Randolph was the first manager in major league history to have his team's record improve by at least 12 games in each of his first two seasons (excluding seasons following strike-shortened seasons). He came in second place in the 2006 NL [[Major League Baseball Manager of the Year Award|Manager of the Year]] voting, losing to [[Florida Marlins]] manager [[Joe Girardi]]. On January 24, 2007, Randolph signed a three-year, $5.65 million contract extension with the Mets. He had a club option for 2010 worth an additional $2.5 million.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2741732 |title=Randolph agrees to $5.65 million, three-year deal |accessdate=October 1, 2008 |publisher=ESPN |date=February 15, 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, Randolph was managing the Mets when they had one of the worst collapses in major league history. Holding a seven-game first-place lead in the NL East with only 17 games to play, the Mets finished 5\u201312 and lost the division to the [[Philadelphia Phillies]], who went 13\u20134 in the same timespan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/01/sports/baseball/01mets.html |title=Mets Complete Stunning Collapse |accessdate=October 1, 2008 |date=October 1, 2007 |work=The New York Times |first=Ben |last=Shpigel}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, Randolph's job security steadily decreased after a disappointing start to the season and inconsistent performance through mid-June. On June 17, 2008, less than two hours after the Mets' 9\u20136 road victory over the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim]], Randolph was fired, along with pitching coach [[Rick Peterson]] and first base coach [[Tom Nieto]]. He and his coaches were replaced by interim manager [[Jerry Manuel]] and coaches [[Ken Oberkfell]], [[Dan Warthen]], and [[Luis Aguayo]].<ref name=\"WillieFired\">{{cite news |first=Ken |last=Peters |title=New York Mets Fire Willie Randolph In Midnight Bloodbath |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/06/17/new-york-mets-fire-willie_n_107493.html |publisher=The Huffington Post |date=June 17, 2007 |accessdate=October 1, 2008 }}</ref> The team's record at the time of the firing was 34\u201335, which was 6\u00bd games behind the Phillies in the National League East. After 2008, the Mets did not have another winning season until 2015.\n\nAfter the 2008 season, Randolph was interviewed by the Milwaukee Brewers for their managerial position. Although he was one of the three finalists, the job went to [[Ken Macha]], and Randolph was given the [[bench coach]] position, which he held until November 2010.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/sports/34144474.html |title=Randolph named bench coach |accessdate=November 8, 2008 |publisher=Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel |date=November 8, 2008}}</ref> According to Brewers GM Doug Melvin, Randolph was asked to be Macha's bench coach because Randolph had experience managing against National League teams, versus Macha's American League experience.\n\nOn November 23, 2010, Randolph was named as the final piece to [[Buck Showalter]]'s coaching staff for the 2011 [[Baltimore Orioles]].

Upon retiring as a player, he joined the Yankees as a coach for 11 years.  He later served as manager of the [[New York Mets]] from 2005 to June 2008, leading the Mets to a league-best record and NLCS in 2006.\n\n==Playing career==\nRandolph grew up in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and graduated from [[Samuel J. Tilden High School]], where he was a star athlete and was drafted by the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] in the 7th round of the 1972 draft. He made his major league debut in 1975, and was, at age 21, the sixth-youngest player in the [[National League]].\n\n[[File:Willie Randolph.jpg|thumb|left|Randolph with the Mets]]\nIn December 1975 he was traded by the Pirates with [[Ken Brett]] and [[Dock Ellis]] to the Yankees for [[Doc Medich]].<ref name=\"googlenews\">{{cite web | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=d3sjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=f9YEAAAAIBAJ&pg=1081,2130255 | title=December 12, 1975 | publisher=Google Newspaper | accessdate=August 11, 2014}}</ref>\n\nRandolph spent 13 of his 18 seasons as a player with the Yankees and was co-captain of the Yankees with Ron Guidry from 1986 to 1988.  He later played for the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] (1989\u201390), [[Oakland Athletics]] (1990), and [[Milwaukee Brewers]] (1991), finishing his career with the [[New York Mets]] in 1992. He was selected to six [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] teams over his career. As a career number 2 hitter in the order, he made use of his skills as [[bunt (baseball)|bunter]] and a patient hitter who drew more than 80 [[base on balls|walks]] seven times.\n\nRandolph was also an outstanding defensive player, known especially for his ability to turn the [[double play]]. However, he never received the [[Gold Glove Award]], which was perennially awarded to his equally sure-handed and more acrobatic and wide-ranging contemporaries: [[Frank White (baseball)|Frank White]] of the [[Kansas City Royals]] and [[Lou Whitaker]] of the [[Detroit Tigers]]. He was the Yankees' starting second baseman on the [[1977 World Series|1977]] and [[1978 World Series]] Championship teams.\n\nIn 1980 Randolph led the league in walks (119) and was second in the AL in [[on-base percentage]] (.427), eighth in [[stolen base]]s (30) and ninth in [[run (baseball)|runs]] (99), and won the [[Silver Slugger Award]] at second base in the AL. He also batted .332 leading off the inning, and .340 with men in scoring position.\n\nIn 1987 he batted .305 and led the league in at bats per strikeout (18.0), and was fourth in the AL in OBP (.411) and ninth in walks (82). He also batted .366 in tie games, and .345 in games that were late and close.\n\nIn December 1988 he signed as a [[free agent]] with the Los Angeles Dodgers. Randolph led the Dodgers in batting average and hits in 1989, making his sixth All-Star team. In May 1990 he was traded by the Dodgers to the defending-world champion Oakland Athletics for [[Stan Javier]]. Later that year, Randolph and the A's won the American League pennant, but were swept by the NL-champion Cincinnati Reds in the World Series.\n\nIn April 1991 he signed as a free agent with the Milwaukee Brewers. That year, Randolph was second in the AL on-base percentage (.424) and third in batting average (.327). He batted .373 with runners in scoring position.\n\nIn December 1991 he signed as a free agent with the New York Mets. In 1992, at 37 years old he was the eighth-oldest player in the NL. In his last career game with the Mets, the team's second baseman of the future [[Jeff Kent]] moved to make his start at [[shortstop]] to allow Randolph to play his final game at second base.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n==Coaching and managing career==\nRandolph was a Yankees base and bench coach for 11 seasons, interviewing intermittently for managing jobs with other teams. In 2004, Randolph was named Mets manager for the [[2005 in baseball|2005 season]], despite never having managed before at any level of baseball. He became the eighth person to play for and later manage the Mets, joining [[Gil Hodges]], [[Yogi Berra]], [[Joe Torre]], [[Bud Harrelson]], [[Roy McMillan]], [[Dallas Green (baseball)|Dallas Green]], and [[Bobby Valentine]] (as well as [[interim|interim manager]] [[Mike Cubbage]]).{{ref|a}} <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/NYM/|title=New York Mets Team History & Encyclopedia \u2013 Baseball-Reference.com}}</ref> Randolph earned his first win as a manager on April 10, 2005, defeating the [[Atlanta Braves]] 2\u20131.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/NYM/2005_sched.shtml|title=2005 New York Mets Schedule, Box Scores and Splits|work=Baseball-Reference.com}}</ref> The win halted a five-game losing streak to start the 2005 season. He then guided the Mets to five straight additional victories, giving the Mets their first six-game winning streak since August 2003.\nRandolph ended his first season as manager of the 2005 Mets with an 83\u201379 record, the first time the franchise had finished above .500 since 2001, and 12 games better than the prior season. That record got them a tie for third place in the [[National League East]].\n\n[[File:Willie Randolph Milwaukee Brewers Bench Coach.jpg|thumb|right|Randolph with the Brewers]]\nIn 2006, Randolph managed the Mets to a league-best 97\u201365 record (which also tied for the best record in the majors with the crosstown Yankees) and the NL East Division title (the team's first division championship since 1988). The Mets came within one game of reaching the World Series, losing the seventh game of the [[2006 National League Championship Series|NL Championship Series]] to the eventual world champion [[St. Louis Cardinals]]. Randolph was the first manager in major league history to have his team's record improve by at least 12 games in each of his first two seasons (excluding seasons following strike-shortened seasons). He came in second place in the 2006 NL [[Major League Baseball Manager of the Year Award|Manager of the Year]] voting, losing to [[Florida Marlins]] manager [[Joe Girardi]]. On January 24, 2007, Randolph signed a three-year, $5.65 million contract extension with the Mets. He had a club option for 2010 worth an additional $2.5 million.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2741732 |title=Randolph agrees to $5.65 million, three-year deal |accessdate=October 1, 2008 |publisher=ESPN |date=February 15, 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, Randolph was managing the Mets when they had one of the worst collapses in major league history. Holding a seven-game first-place lead in the NL East with only 17 games to play, the Mets finished 5\u201312 and lost the division to the [[Philadelphia Phillies]], who went 13\u20134 in the same timespan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/01/sports/baseball/01mets.html |title=Mets Complete Stunning Collapse |accessdate=October 1, 2008 |date=October 1, 2007 |work=The New York Times |first=Ben |last=Shpigel}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, Randolph's job security steadily decreased after a disappointing start to the season and inconsistent performance through mid-June. On June 17, 2008, less than two hours after the Mets' 9\u20136 road victory over the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim]], Randolph was fired, along with pitching coach [[Rick Peterson]] and first base coach [[Tom Nieto]]. He and his coaches were replaced by interim manager [[Jerry Manuel]] and coaches [[Ken Oberkfell]], [[Dan Warthen]], and [[Luis Aguayo]].<ref name=\"WillieFired\">{{cite news |first=Ken |last=Peters |title=New York Mets Fire Willie Randolph In Midnight Bloodbath |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/06/17/new-york-mets-fire-willie_n_107493.html |publisher=The Huffington Post |date=June 17, 2007 |accessdate=October 1, 2008 }}</ref> The team's record at the time of the firing was 34\u201335, which was 6\u00bd games behind the Phillies in the National League East. After 2008, the Mets did not have another winning season until 2015.\n\nAfter the 2008 season, Randolph was interviewed by the Milwaukee Brewers for their managerial position. Although he was one of the three finalists, the job ultimately went to [[Ken Macha]], and Randolph was given the [[bench coach]] position, which he held until November 2010.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/sports/34144474.html |title=Randolph named bench coach |accessdate=November 8, 2008 |publisher=Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel |date=November 8, 2008}}</ref> According to Brewers GM Doug Melvin, Randolph was asked to be Macha's bench coach because Randolph had experience managing against National League teams, versus Macha's American League experience.\n\nOn November 23, 2010, Randolph was named as the final piece to [[Buck Showalter]]'s coaching staff for the 2011 [[Baltimore Orioles]].

Rounds'', 4:05-cv-04077 (D.S.D. Aug. 10, 2006), ECF No. 208.</ref>\n\n=== The District Court Ruling ===\nThe district court [[Preliminary injunction|preliminarily enjoined]] the Act, preventing the statute from taking effect.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 375 F.Supp.2d 881 (D.S.D. June 30, 2005).</ref> The district court found that the informed consent provisions contained in the challenged South Dakota law went \"much further than the informed consent statute upheld in [[Planned Parenthood v. Casey|Casey]], and other cases reviewing similar statutes.\"<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 375 F.Supp.2d 881, 886 (D.S.D. June 30, 2005).</ref> The district court held that the mandated disclosures were not a reasonable regulation of the medical profession, and instead violated the physicians' [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights \"by compelling them to espouse the state's ideology\" \"on an unsettled medical, philosophical, theological, and scientific issue.\"<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 375 F.Supp.2d 881, 886-887 (D.S.D. June 30, 2005).</ref> The district court found it significant that the statute lacked a provision expressly allowing a physician to disassociate herself from the required disclosures (which had been a feature of a similar North Dakota law).<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 375 F.Supp.2d 881, 887 (D.S.D. June 30, 2005).</ref> The district court granted a [[Injunction|preliminary injunction]] based on its finding that Planned Parenthood had a fair chance of success on its claim that the law violated physicians' free speech rights, and that the balance of the harms came out in Planned Parenthood's favor.  \n\n=== Appeal to the Eighth Circuit ===\nOn July 26, 2005, the state, along with crisis pregnancy centers that had intervened in the case, appealed the district court's preliminary injunction to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]].<ref>Brief of Appellant, Planned Parenthood v. Rounds, No. 05-3093 (8th Cir. September 2005).</ref> A divided panel of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] affirmed the lower court's decision to grant the preliminary injunction.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 467 F.3d 716 (8th Cir. 2006).</ref> The defendants and intervenors then petitioned the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] for a re-hearing [[en banc]], which the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] granted.\n\nThe [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]], sitting [[en banc]], [[Vacated judgment|vacated]] the [[Injunction|preliminary injunction]] and [[Remand (court procedure)|remanded]] the case to the district court for future proceedings.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 530 F.3d 724 (8th Cir. 2008).</ref> The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] found that Planned Parenthood had failed to demonstrate the requisite likelihood of success on its claim that the statutorily-required disclosure was untruthful and misleading. As part of its holding, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] clarified that \"where a preliminary injunction of a duly enacted state statute is sought, we require a more rigorous threshold showing that the movant is likely to prevail on the merits.\"<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 530 F.3d 724, 730 (8th Cir. 2008)</ref> The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] stated that Planned Parenthood could only succeed on the merits of its claim that that the law violated the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] if it showed that the required disclosures were untruthful, misleading, or not relevant to the pregnant woman's decision to abort.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 530 F.3d 724, 735 (8th Cir. 2008).</ref>The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] found that the district court had based its conclusion \"on an error of law when it ignored the statutory definition of 'human being.'\"<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 530 F.3d 724, 733 (8th Cir. 2008)</ref>\n\n=== Remand to the District Court ===\nOn remand to the district court, all sides moved for [[summary judgment]] with respect to the challenged provisions.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 650 F. Supp. 2d 972, 975 (D.S.D. 2009).</ref> The district court issued rulings on the biological disclosure, the relationship disclosures, the medical risk disclosures, and the medical emergency exception.\n\n==== Biological Disclosure ====\nThe biological disclosure was the statutory requirement that a doctor tell a pregnant patient \"[t]hat the abortion will terminate the life of a whole, separate, unique, living human being.\"<ref>S.D. Codified Laws. \u00a734-23A-10.1(1)(b), available at https://sdlegislature.gov/Statutes/Codified_Laws/DisplayStatute.aspx?Type=Statute&Statute=34-23A-10.1. </ref> Although defendants' oral argument and Judge Gruender's dissent in the initial [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] opinion both suggested that the statute did not require  doctors  to dictate the statute verbatim to their patients, the district court was bound to follow the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]]'s [[en banc]] opinion which stated that the disclosure had to consist of the language laid out in the statute.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 650 F. Supp. 2d 972, 976 (D.S.D. 2009).</ref> The district court, therefore, found that prior to performing an abortion, a doctor must recite the biological disclosure outlined in the statute.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 650 F. Supp. 2d 972, 976 (D.S.D. 2009).</ref> \n\n==== Relationship Disclosures ====\nThe South Dakota statute mandated two relationship disclosures. Physicians were required to tell a pregnant patient that she had an existing \"relationship\" with an unborn human being which was protected by the [[Constitution of the United States|U.S. Constitution]] and South Dakota law, and that procuring an abortion would end that existing \"relationship.\"<ref>S.D. Codified Laws. \u00a734-23A-10.1(1)(b)-(c), available at https://sdlegislature.gov/Statutes/Codified_Laws/DisplayStatute.aspx?Type=Statute&Statute=34-23A-10.1. </ref> The statute did not define the term \"relationship\" and the state had conceded in an earlier proceeding that the term was used in a legal--not biological--context.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 650 F. Supp. 2d 972, 977 (D.S.D. 2009).</ref> The district court found that the legal definition of a relationship requires at least two people. Furthermore, the [[Constitution of the United States|U.S. Constitution]] does not comprehend an embryo or fetus to be a \"person,\" in the legal sense of that word.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 650 F. Supp. 2d 972, 978 (D.S.D. 2009).</ref> In fact, the district court noted that in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', which remained controlling precedent, the Supreme Court stated that \u201cthe word \u2018person,\u2019 as used in the Fourteenth Amendment, does not include the unborn\u201d and that \u201cthe unborn have never been recognized in the law as persons in the whole sense.\u201d<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 650 F. Supp. 2d 972, 978 (D.S.D. 2009).</ref> South Dakota similarly had not established that an embryo or fetus was a \"person\" in the context of a legal relationship with a pregnant woman.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 650 F. Supp. 2d 972, 978-79 (D.S.D. 2009).</ref> The district court thus found the relationship disclosures to be untruthful and misleading, and thus unconstitutional.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 650 F. Supp. 2d 972, 978-79 (D.S.D. 2009).</ref>\n\n==== Medical Risk Disclosures ====\nThe medical risk disclosures mandated by the statute required a physician to tell a patient of \"of all known medical risks of the procedure and statistically significant risk factors to which the pregnant woman would be subjected, including ... (ii) Increased risk of suicide ideation and suicide.\"<ref>S.D. Codified Laws. \u00a734-23A-10.1(1)(e), available at https://sdlegislature.gov/Statutes/Codified_Laws/DisplayStatute.aspx?Type=Statute&Statute=34-23A-10.1. </ref> Although the district court found the \"all known medical risks\" phrase constitutional on its face, since an individual could ascertain the meaning of that phrase in order to comply with it, the district court found the phrase \"statistically significant risk factors\" unconstitutionally vague because its meaning was not readily ascertainable.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 650 F. Supp. 2d 972, 980-82 (D.S.D. 2009).</ref> Following common cannons of [[statutory construction]], the district court reasoned that the statute dictated that physicians inform patients of medical risks ''caused'' by abortions.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 650 F. Supp. 2d 972, 982 (D.S.D. 2009).</ref> Because no party presented evidence that proved that it was a generally recognized fact that abortions cause an increased risk of suicide ideation and suicide, the district court found the mandated disclosure of that \"risk\" to be untruthful and misleading, and thus unconstitutional.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 650 F. Supp. 2d 972, 983 (D.S.D. 2009).</ref>\n\n==== Medical Emergency Exception ====\nThe medical emergency exception is found in the portion of the statutes that required the physician to obtain the informed consent of the pregnant woman unless it is impossible due to do so due to a medical emergency and where delaying the procedure in order to get consent from the woman's next of kin is similarly impossible. The district court dismissed the defendants' argument that the plaintiffs lacked standing to sue on this matter, citing controlling precedent which gave abortion doctors standing to challenge a statute that might subject them to criminal prosecution.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 650 F. Supp. 2d 972, 984 (D.S.D. 2009) (citing ''Doe v. Bolton'', 410 U.S. 179, 188 (1973)).</ref> The district court further concluded that the physician plaintiffs had [[third-party standing]]. The district court nevertheless found the emergency medical exception to be constitutional on its face.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 650 F. Supp. 2d 972, 986-87 (D.S.D. 2009).</ref>\n\n==== Summary of District Court Opinion ====\nIn summary, the District Court granted summary judgement in favor of Planned Parenthood on the relationship and suicide advisories--which it struck down as unconstitutional under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendments]]--and summary judgement in favor of South Dakota on the human being and risk advisories.\n\n=== Second Appeal to the Eighth Circuit ===\nSouth Dakota and the intervening crisis pregnancy centers appealed the District Court's rulings in Planned Parenthood's favor, and Planned Parenthood cross appealed the rulings in South Dakota's favor.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 653 F.3d 662, 666-67 (8th Cir. 2011).</ref>\n\nOn appeal, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] panel rejected Planned Parenthood's [[facial challenge]] to the human being advisory contained within the statute's relationship disclosures. The panel said that an as-applied challenge would be the only appropriate means for a court to consider whether a doctor would be permitted to use language other than that detailed in the advisory.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 653 F.3d 662, 668 (8th Cir. 2011).</ref> The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] also rejected Planned Parenthood's allegation that the relationship disclosure unconstitutionally forced doctors to convey moral and philosophical messages regarding abortion. Instead, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] adopted the reading proposed by South Dakota, holding that the relationship disclosure merely informed a woman that she \"is legally and constitutionally protected against being forced to have an abortion.\"<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 653 F.3d 662, 669 (8th Cir. 2011).</ref> The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] described this reading of the statute to be \"truthful, not misleading, and relevant to the abortion decision,\" and thus constitutional.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 653 F.3d 662, 669-70 (8th Cir. 2011).</ref> The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] rejected Planned Parenthood's broad challenge to the medical risk disclosure as being void for vagueness, reasoning that a doctor of ordinary intelligence could figure out how to comply with the statute.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 653 F.3d 662, 673 (8th Cir. 2011).</ref> The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] panel, however, did agree with the district court and Planned Parenthood on the unconstitutionality of the suicide advisory that formed part of the medical risk disclosure. The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] found the suicide advisory to be compelled untruthful speech, which placed an undue burden on women's [[due process]] right to voluntary abortion and violated physicians' \"[[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] right to be free from [[compelled speech]] that is untruthful, misleading, or irrelevant.\"<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 653 F.3d 662, 673 (8th Cir. 2011).</ref>\n\nThe defendants and the intervening crisis pregnancy centers then petitioned for a rehearing [[en banc]]. The rehearing [[en banc]] was \"limited to the issue of whether the district court erred in enjoining the provisions of South Dakota Century Law 34\u201323A\u201310.1(1)(e)(ii) dealing with the suicide advisory.\"<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 662 F.3d 1072 (8th Cir. 2011).</ref>\n\n== Final Eighth Circuit Decision ==\nThe [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] granted a rehearing [[en banc]] solely to resolve the question of the constitutionality of the mandated suicide advisory.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 893 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref> The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] held that the mandated suicide advisory was truthful and did not impose an unconstitutional [[Undue burden standard|undue burden]] on women seeking abortions or their physicians. \n\nThe [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] maintained that for Planned Parenthood to win on either its [[Undue burden standard|undue burden]] or [[compelled speech]] claims, it needed to demonstrate that the suicide advisory was untruthful, misleading, or not relevant to the pregnant patient's abortion decision.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 893 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref> The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] maintained that Planned Parenthood had failed to meet its burden of proof. Unlike the district court and the prior [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] panel, the [[en banc]] [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]]  did not read the statutory language to require the disclosure of a causal connection between abortion and suicide.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 894 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref> Rather, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] read the phrase \"increased risk\" in the statute to mean \"relative risk\" and to not require proof of causation.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 895 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref>\n\nAfter examining the record, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] concluded that \"the studies submitted by the State are sufficiently reliable to support the truth of the proposition that the relative risk of suicide and suicide ideation is higher for women who abort their pregnancies compared to women who give birth or have not become pregnant,\" and that this relative risk is generally \"known.\"<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 898-99 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref> The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] thus concluded that the disclosure mandated by the suicide advisory was truthful.\n\nPlanned Parenthood argued that the suicide advisory was misleading and irrelevant because the correlation between abortion and suicide was likely the result of other underlying factors, such as pre-existing mental health problems, which \"predispose some women both to have unwanted pregnancies and to have suicidal tendencies.\"<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 899 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref> The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] rejected this argument because it said that to render the advisory unconstitutionally misleading or irrelevant, Planned Parenthood would have to prove \"that abortion has been ruled out, to a degree of scientifically accepted certainty, as a [[Statistical significance|statistically significant]] causal factor in post-abortion suicides.\"<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 899 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref> \n\nPlanned Parenthood pointed to three main pieces of evidence to demonstrate that abortion was not considered a [[Statistical significance|statistically significant]] factor in post-abortion suicides. First, Planned Parenthood pointed out that the label approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (\"FDA\") for the abortion-inducing drug [[Mifeprex]] excluded suicide or suicide ideation as a risk of using the drug. Planned Parenthood argued that the absence of a suicide advisory from the FDA label for the drug was particularly significant given that the FDA requires drug labels to contain all \"clinically significant adverse reactions\" and \"other potential safety hazards.\"<ref>21 C.F.R. \u00a7 201.57(c)(6)(i).</ref><ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 899 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref> The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] rejected this argument, claiming that FDA-approved labels do not represent a definitive or exclusive list of risks associated with a given drug. Second, Planned Parenthood noted that the [[American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]] (\"ACOG\") summarily rejected the claim that suicide and suicide ideation are known risks of abortion.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 900 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref> The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] dismissed this point because it felt that there was insufficient information in the record regarding how [[American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists|ACOG]] came to this conclusion.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 900-01 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref> Third, Planned Parenthood cited a report prepared by the [[American Psychological Association]] (\"APA\") that reviewed 50 published peer-reviewed papers analyzing empirical data regarding the psychological outcomes of those who had abortions as compared to those who did not. The [[American Psychological Association|APA]] identified methodological deficiencies in all of the studies that found that there was an increased mental health risk associated with abortion.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 901 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref> The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] rejected the utility of this evidence because, although the [[American Psychological Association|APA]] report found that studies had yet to establish with certainty that abortion is a causal factor in post-abortion suicide, the report conversely did not prove that abortion was ruled out as a statistically significant causal factor in such suicides.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 901 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref> The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] also went on to reject other publications in the record which the dissent had suggested eliminated uncertainty about the absence of the causal role of abortion in increasing the risk of suicide.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 902 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref> The majority refused to give credence to these publications based on what it perceived to be methodological deficiencies in those studies.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 902-4 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref> \n\nThus, the majority of the [[en banc]] [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] concluded that although the record reflected medical and scientific uncertainty as to whether abortion was correlated with suicide, there was nothing in the record that proved that abortion had been entirely ruled out as a cause of suicide. Given that uncertainty, and since the majority read the record to suggest that the relative risk of suicide and suicide ideation was higher for women who abort as \"compared to women in other relevant groups,\"<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 905 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref> the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] concluded that the state legislature was \"in the best position to weigh the divergent results and come to a conclusion about the best way to protect its populace.\"<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 904 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref>\n\nThus, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] held that \"the suicide advisory present[ed] neither an [[Undue burden standard|undue burden]] on abortion rights not a violation of physicians' [[Freedom of speech|free speech]] rights.\"<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 906 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref> The Court, therefore, reversed the district court's grant of [[summary judgment]] to Planned Parenthood as to S.D.C.L. \u00a7 34\u201323A\u201310.1(1)(e)(ii), directed that [[summary judgment]] be awarded to the State as to that provision, and [[Vacated judgment|vacated]] the [[Injunction|permanent injunction]] that had precluded enforcement of that provision.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 906 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref>\n\n== Concurrences ==\n\n=== Judge Loken's Concurrence ===\n[[James B. Loken|Judge Loken]] wrote a brief concurrence in which he noted that he agreed with the dissent that the plain language of the statute regarding the medical risks disclosure \"strongly suggest[ed] legislative intent to require that a physician make an untruthful, misleading causation disclosure.\"<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 906 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref> Nevertheless, [[James B. Loken|Judge Loken]] joined the majority because he read the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]]'s decision as limiting the facial constitutionality of the statute to \"only a disclosure as to relative risk that the physician can adapt to fit his or her professional opinion of the conflicting medical research\" regarding abortion.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 906 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref>\n\n=== Judge Colloton's Concurrence ===\n[[Steven Colloton|Judge Colloton]] wrote a brief concurrence which almost exclusively endorsed the [[en banc]] panel's opinion. [[Steven Colloton|Judge Colloton]]'s only disagreement with the majority opinion was that he found \"it unnecessary to consider the meaning of the hypothetical phrase 'a description of all known medical risks of the procedure...to which the pregnant women would be subjected.'\"<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 906 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref>\n\n== Dissent ==\n[[Diana E. Murphy|Judge Murphy]] wrote a [[Dissenting opinion|dissent]]--joined by [[Roger Leland Wollman|Judge Wollman]], [[Kermit Edward Bye|Judge Bye]], and [[Michael Joseph Melloy|Judge Melloy]]--that sharply rebuked the majority opinion.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref> The dissent maintained that the district court had correctly concluded that South Dakota's mandatory disclosure law was unconstitutional, arguing that the law \"will not inform the free choice of a woman and is not consistent with the medical evidence.\"<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 907 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref>\n\nThe dissent characterized the majority as seeking \"to avoid the constitutional problem created by the current statutory text\" by claiming that the new statutory language--that is, the language challenged by Planned Parenthood in this case--\"merely inform[s] women that their decision to have an abortion would 'cause[] [them] to become a member of a group' with a statistically higher rate of suicide.\"<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 908 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref> The dissent pointed out that this was a flawed argument for two reasons. First, the majority's reading was inconsistent with the plain language of the statute.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 908 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref> Second, the medical evidence suggested that women sharing certain attributes might have a higher rate of suicide--not that abortion caused suicide.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 908 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref> In fact, the dissenters argued that the vast majority of researchers maintain that there is no causal relationship between abortion and suicide.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 911 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref>\n\nThe dissent focused, in part, on the changes made to the text of the South Dakota law. The dissenting judges argued that the statutory history should inform both the court's reading of the statute and the words contained therein. An earlier version of the law advised patients about the \"particular medical risks ''associated with'' the particular abortion procedure to be employed, including ''when medically accurate'', the risks of infection, hemorrhage, danger to subsequent pregnancies, and infertility.\"<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 907 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref> By contrast, the version of the statute which Planned Parenthood challenged in this case forced doctors to tell pregnant women that a greater likelihood of suicide and suicidal ideation is a \"''known medical risk''\" to which those women \"''would be subjected''\" by having an abortion.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 907 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref><ref>S.D. Codified Laws. \u00a734-23A-10.1(1)(e), available at https://sdlegislature.gov/Statutes/Codified_Laws/DisplayStatute.aspx?Type=Statute&Statute=34-23A-10.1. </ref> The dissent found the switch from \"risks associated with\" to \"would be subjected [to]\" dispositive as to the question of statutory intent; the statutory drafters meant the mandatory disclosure to convey casualty. This conclusion was supported by legislative findings.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 908 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref> \n\nThe dissent described the majority as having devised a test wherein, so long as there could theoretically be a casual link between abortion and suicide, a suicide advisory like South Dakota's would be considered truthful, non-misleading, and relevant--unless, that is, a plaintiff could prove the absence of the causal link with  \u201cscientifically accepted certainty.\"<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 910 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref> The majority created this test, the dissenters explained, because it had already conceded that if the correlation between abortion and suicide were not due to a causal relationship, the suicide advisory would be misleading or irrelevant, and thus unconstitutional. The dissent then pointed out the critical flaw in the majority's approach: the vast majority of researchers insisted that there was no causal relationship between abortion and suicide.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 910 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref> \n\nTo support its contention that the majority of researchers had concluded that abortion did not cause suicide, the dissent provided an overview of the extensive evidence in the record supporting that assertion. This evidence included the aforementioned [[American Psychological Association|APA]] report, [[American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists|ACOG]]'s most recent edition of medical opinions, and statements from the author of two of the studies upon which the state and intervenors had relied wherein the author rejected the contention that his findings suggested that abortion caused suicide. The dissent also noted that the State's expert had had her abortion studies publicly discredited.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 910 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref> The dissenting judges further pointed out that several of the other studies upon which the state and intervenors relied were ones that had been criticized for comparing pregnant women to a group \"irrelevant to a pregnant woman's decision to have an abortion.\"<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 909 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref> The dissenters went on to observe that in the time since the district court enjoined the suicide advisory and an Eighth Circuit panel affirmed that decision, the United Kingdom's [[Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists]] (\"RCOG\") issued guidance that women \"be informed that the evidence that suggests that they are no more or less likely to suffer adverse psychological [[Sequela|sequelae]] whether they have an abortion or continue with the pregnancy and have the baby.\"<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 909 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref> [[Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists|RCOG]] based its conclusion on a number of studies that established that \"post abortion suicide rates are linked to preexisting mental illness and [[domestic violence]], not to the decision to undergo an abortion.\"<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 910 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref>\n\nThe dissenters maintained that the state's interest in this case--to promote a \"wise,\" mature[,] and informed\" decision by women considering abortion<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Casey'', 505 U.S. 833, 887 (1992).</ref>--was thwarted by the suicide advisory.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 911 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref> The dissent argued that because the majority of medical research refutes the claim that abortion causes an increased risk of suicide, the state's failure to not inform a pregnant patient of that fact, compounded by its forcing doctors to tell the woman the opposite, hurt any valid interest the state might have and gravely undermined the constitutionality of the mandated advisory.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 911 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref>\n\nThe dissenters went on to note that, since Planned Parenthood's challenge, the South Dakota legislature and governor had amended its state abortion regulations to be more in line with the predominant \"view in the medical community that abortion does not cause mental health problems such as suicidal ideation and suicide.\"<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 911 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref> The new statutory language was consistent with the view that preexisting risk factors that may coincide with abortion were what lead to an increased risk of suicide.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 912 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref>\n\nThe dissent concluded by stating that \"[b]y forcing doctors to inform women that abortion subjects them to a risk which the record medical evidence refutes, the suicide advisory places an undue burden on a pregnant woman's [[Due Process Clause|due process]] rights and violates a doctor's [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] right against [[compelled speech]].\"<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 912 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\nCommentators have criticized the decision that the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] reached in this case. Some have criticized informed consent provisions like those at issue in ''Planned Parenthood v.

Wade]]'', but changed the standard employed to evaluate restrictions on that right.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Casey'', 505 U.S. 833 (1992).</ref> The Supreme Court created the \"[[Undue burden standard|undue burden]]\" standard for abortion restrictions, whereby a restriction is deemed impermissible if \"its purpose or effect is to place a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability.\"<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Casey'', 505 U.S. 833, 878 (1992).</ref>\n\n=== The Challenged Law ===\nIn 2005, the South Dakota legislature enacted House Bill 1166, which revised the requirements for obtaining patients' informed consent to an abortion by expanding the law's disclosure requirements.

Ball (hereinafter collectively \"Planned Parenthood\") challenged the South Dakota law in a lawsuit filed with the [[United States District Court for the District of South Dakota|District Court for the District of South Dakota]], asking the district court to declare the contested provisions unconstitutional and to grant [[injunctive relief]] precluding enforcement of those provisions.<ref>First Amended Complaint, ''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 4:05-cv-04077 (D.S.D. Aug. 10, 2006), ECF No. 208.</ref> Planned Parenthood argued that various provisions of the South Dakota law constituted an [[Undue burden standard|undue burden]] on abortion rights, facially violated patents' and physicians' First Amendment rights, and were [[Vagueness doctrine|unconstitutionally vague]].<ref>First Amended Complaint, ''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 4:05-cv-04077 (D.S.D. Aug. 10, 2006), ECF No. 208.</ref> Planned Parenthood believed that the amendments to South Dakota's notice law forced abortion providers to convey the state of South Dakota's ideology and philosophical beliefs regarding abortion, in violation of their [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] rights.<ref>First Amended Complaint, ''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 4:05-cv-04077 (D.S.D. Aug. 10, 2006), ECF No. 208.</ref> Planned Parenthood also argued that the law violated pregnant women's [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] rights by forcing them to listen to and understand the state's anti-abortion beliefs.<ref>First Amended Complaint, ''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 4:05-cv-04077 (D.S.D. Aug. 10, 2006), ECF No. 208.</ref> Planned Parenthood further contended that the state violated pregnant women's [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] right to privacy and liberty by forcing them to listen to and certify an understanding of untrue and misleading information about abortion, and that this amounted to an [[Undue burden standard|undue burden]] on women's right to choose an abortion.<ref>First Amended Complaint, ''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 4:05-cv-04077 (D.S.D. Aug. 10, 2006), ECF No. 208.</ref> Plaintiff finally argued that other provisions in the statute were impermissibly vague, in violation of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]'s [[Due Process Clause|due process clause]], and that the law's health exception was inadequate.<ref>First Amended Complaint, ''Planned Parenthood v.

Rounds'', 375 F.Supp.2d 881 (D.S.D. June 30, 2005).</ref> The district court found that the informed consent provisions contained in the challenged South Dakota law went \"much further than the informed consent statute upheld in [[Planned Parenthood v. Casey|Casey]], and other cases reviewing similar statutes.\"<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 375 F.Supp.2d 881, 886 (D.S.D. June 30, 2005).</ref> The district court held that the mandated disclosures were not a reasonable regulation of the medical profession, and instead violated the physicians' [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights \"by compelling them to espouse the state's ideology\" \"on an unsettled medical, philosophical, theological, and scientific issue.\"<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 375 F.Supp.2d 881, 886-887 (D.S.D. June 30, 2005).</ref> The district court found it significant that the statute lacked a provision expressly allowing a physician to disassociate herself from the required disclosures (which had been a feature of a similar North Dakota law).<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 375 F.Supp.2d 881, 887 (D.S.D. June 30, 2005).</ref> The district court granted a [[Injunction|preliminary injunction]] based on its finding that Planned Parenthood had a fair chance of success on its claim that the law violated physicians' free speech rights, and that the balance of the harms came out in Planned Parenthood's favor.  \n\n=== Appeal to the Eighth Circuit ===\nOn July 26, 2005, the state, along with crisis pregnancy centers that had intervened in the case, appealed the district court's preliminary injunction to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]].<ref>Brief of Appellant, Planned Parenthood v. Rounds, No. 05-3093 (8th Cir. September 2005).</ref> A divided panel of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] affirmed the lower court's decision to grant the preliminary injunction.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 467 F.3d 716 (8th Cir. 2006).</ref> The defendants and intervenors then petitioned the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] for a re-hearing [[en banc]], which the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] granted.\n\nThe [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]], sitting [[en banc]], [[Vacated judgment|vacated]] the [[Injunction|preliminary injunction]] and [[Remand (court procedure)|remanded]] the case to the district court for future proceedings.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 530 F.3d 724 (8th Cir. 2008).</ref> The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] found that Planned Parenthood had failed to demonstrate the requisite likelihood of success on its claim that the statutorily-required disclosure was untruthful and misleading. As part of its holding, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] clarified that \"where a preliminary injunction of a duly enacted state statute is sought, we require a more rigorous threshold showing that the movant is likely to prevail on the merits.\"<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 530 F.3d 724, 730 (8th Cir. 2008)</ref> The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] stated that Planned Parenthood could only succeed on the merits of its claim that that the law violated the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] if it showed that the required disclosures were untruthful, misleading, or not relevant to the pregnant woman's decision to abort.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 530 F.3d 724, 735 (8th Cir. 2008).</ref>The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] found that the district court had based its conclusion \"on an error of law when it ignored the statutory definition of 'human being.'\"<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 530 F.3d 724, 733 (8th Cir. 2008)</ref>\n\n=== Remand to the District Court ===\nOn remand to the district court, all sides moved for [[summary judgment]] with respect to the challenged provisions.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 650 F. Supp. 2d 972, 975 (D.S.D. 2009).</ref> The district court issued rulings on the biological disclosure, the relationship disclosures, the medical risk disclosures, and the medical emergency exception.\n\n==== Biological Disclosure ====\nThe biological disclosure was the statutory requirement that a doctor tell a pregnant patient \"[t]hat the abortion will terminate the life of a whole, separate, unique, living human being.\"<ref>S.D. Codified Laws. \u00a734-23A-10.1(1)(b), available at https://sdlegislature.gov/Statutes/Codified_Laws/DisplayStatute.aspx?Type=Statute&Statute=34-23A-10.1. </ref> Although defendants' oral argument and Judge Gruender's dissent in the initial [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] opinion both suggested that the statute did not require  doctors  to dictate the statute verbatim to their patients, the district court was bound to follow the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]]'s [[en banc]] opinion which stated that the disclosure had to consist of the language laid out in the statute.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 650 F. Supp. 2d 972, 976 (D.S.D. 2009).</ref> The district court, therefore, found that prior to performing an abortion, a doctor must recite the biological disclosure outlined in the statute.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 650 F. Supp. 2d 972, 976 (D.S.D. 2009).</ref> \n\n==== Relationship Disclosures ====\nThe South Dakota statute mandated two relationship disclosures. Physicians were required to tell a pregnant patient that she had an existing \"relationship\" with an unborn human being which was protected by the [[Constitution of the United States|U.S. Constitution]] and South Dakota law, and that procuring an abortion would end that existing \"relationship.\"<ref>S.D. Codified Laws. \u00a734-23A-10.1(1)(b)-(c), available at https://sdlegislature.gov/Statutes/Codified_Laws/DisplayStatute.aspx?Type=Statute&Statute=34-23A-10.1. </ref> The statute did not define the term \"relationship\" and the state had conceded in an earlier proceeding that the term was used in a legal--not biological--context.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 650 F. Supp. 2d 972, 977 (D.S.D. 2009).</ref> The district court found that the legal definition of a relationship requires at least two people. Furthermore, the [[Constitution of the United States|U.S. Constitution]] does not comprehend an embryo or fetus to be a \"person,\" in the legal sense of that word.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 650 F. Supp. 2d 972, 978 (D.S.D. 2009).</ref> In fact, the district court noted that in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', which remained controlling precedent, the Supreme Court stated that \u201cthe word \u2018person,\u2019 as used in the Fourteenth Amendment, does not include the unborn\u201d and that \u201cthe unborn have never been recognized in the law as persons in the whole sense.\u201d<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 650 F. Supp. 2d 972, 978 (D.S.D. 2009).</ref> South Dakota similarly had not established that an embryo or fetus was a \"person\" in the context of a legal relationship with a pregnant woman.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 650 F. Supp. 2d 972, 978-79 (D.S.D. 2009).</ref> The district court thus found the relationship disclosures to be untruthful and misleading, and thus unconstitutional.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 650 F. Supp. 2d 972, 978-79 (D.S.D. 2009).</ref>\n\n==== Medical Risk Disclosures ====\nThe medical risk disclosures mandated by the statute required a physician to tell a patient of \"of all known medical risks of the procedure and statistically significant risk factors to which the pregnant woman would be subjected, including ... (ii) Increased risk of suicide ideation and suicide.\"<ref>S.D. Codified Laws. \u00a734-23A-10.1(1)(e), available at https://sdlegislature.gov/Statutes/Codified_Laws/DisplayStatute.aspx?Type=Statute&Statute=34-23A-10.1. </ref> Although the district court found the \"all known medical risks\" phrase constitutional on its face, since an individual could ascertain the meaning of that phrase in order to comply with it, the district court found the phrase \"statistically significant risk factors\" unconstitutionally vague because its meaning was not readily ascertainable.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 650 F. Supp. 2d 972, 980-82 (D.S.D. 2009).</ref> Following common cannons of [[statutory construction]], the district court reasoned that the the statute dictated that physicians inform patients of medical risks ''caused'' by abortions.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 650 F. Supp. 2d 972, 982 (D.S.D. 2009).</ref> Because no party presented evidence that proved that it was a generally recognized fact that abortions cause an increased risk of suicide ideation and suicide, the district court found the mandated disclosure of that \"risk\" to be untruthful and misleading, and thus unconstitutional.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 650 F. Supp. 2d 972, 983 (D.S.D. 2009).</ref>\n\n==== Medical Emergency Exception ====\nThe medical emergency exception is found in the portion of the statutes that required the physician to obtain the informed consent of the pregnant woman unless it is impossible due to do so due to a medical emergency and where delaying the procedure in order to get consent from the woman's next of kin is similarly impossible. The district court dismissed the defendants' argument that the plaintiffs lacked standing to sue on this matter, citing controlling precedent which gave abortion doctors standing to challenge a statute that might subject them to criminal prosecution.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 650 F. Supp. 2d 972, 984 (D.S.D. 2009) (citing ''Doe v. Bolton'', 410 U.S. 179, 188 (1973)).</ref> The district court further concluded that the physician plaintiffs had [[third-party standing]]. The district court nevertheless found the emergency medical exception to be constitutional on its face.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 650 F. Supp. 2d 972, 986-87 (D.S.D. 2009).</ref>\n\n==== Summary of District Court Opinion ====\nIn summary, the District Court granted summary judgement in favor of Planned Parenthood on the relationship and suicide advisories--which it struck down as unconstitutional under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendments]]--and summary judgement in favor of South Dakota on the human being and risk advisories.\n\n=== Second Appeal to the Eighth Circuit ===\nSouth Dakota and the intervening crisis pregnancy centers appealed the District Court's rulings in Planned Parenthood's favor, and Planned Parenthood cross appealed the rulings in South Dakota's favor.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 653 F.3d 662, 666-67 (8th Cir. 2011).</ref>\n\nOn appeal, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] panel rejected Planned Parenthood's [[facial challenge]] to the human being advisory contained within the statute's relationship disclosures. The panel said that an as-applied challenge would be the only appropriate means for a court to consider whether a doctor would be permitted to use language other than that detailed in the advisory.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 653 F.3d 662, 668 (8th Cir. 2011).</ref> The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] also rejected Planned Parenthood's allegation that the relationship disclosure unconstitutionally forced doctors to convey moral and philosophical messages regarding abortion. Instead, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] adopted the reading proposed by South Dakota, holding that the relationship disclosure merely informed a woman that she \"is legally and constitutionally protected against being forced to have an abortion.\"<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 653 F.3d 662, 669 (8th Cir. 2011).</ref> The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] described this reading of the statute to be \"truthful, not misleading, and relevant to the abortion decision,\" and thus constitutional.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 653 F.3d 662, 669-70 (8th Cir. 2011).</ref> The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] rejected Planned Parenthood's broad challenge to the medical risk disclosure as being void for vagueness, reasoning that a doctor of ordinary intelligence could figure out how to comply with the statute.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 653 F.3d 662, 673 (8th Cir. 2011).</ref> The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] panel, however, did agree with the district court and Planned Parenthood on the unconstitutionality of the suicide advisory that formed part of the medical risk disclosure. The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] found the suicide advisory to be compelled untruthful speech, which placed an undue burden on women's [[due process]] right to voluntary abortion and violated physicians' \"[[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] right to be free from [[compelled speech]] that is untruthful, misleading, or irrelevant.\"<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 653 F.3d 662, 673 (8th Cir. 2011).</ref>\n\nThe defendants and the intervening crisis pregnancy centers then petitioned for a rehearing [[en banc]]. The rehearing [[en banc]] was \"limited to the issue of whether the district court erred in enjoining the provisions of South Dakota Century Law 34\u201323A\u201310.1(1)(e)(ii) dealing with the suicide advisory.\"<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 662 F.3d 1072 (8th Cir. 2011).</ref>\n\n== Final Eighth Circuit Decision ==\nThe [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] granted a rehearing [[en banc]] solely to resolve the question of the constitutionality of the mandated suicide advisory.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 893 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref> The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] held that the mandated suicide advisory was truthful and did not impose an unconstitutional [[Undue burden standard|undue burden]] on women seeking abortions or their physicians. \n\nThe [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] maintained that for Planned Parenthood to win on either its [[Undue burden standard|undue burden]] or [[compelled speech]] claims, it needed to demonstrate that the suicide advisory was untruthful, misleading, or not relevant to the pregnant patient's abortion decision.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 893 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref> The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] maintained that Planned Parenthood had failed to meet its burden of proof. Unlike the district court and the prior [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] panel, the [[en banc]] [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]]  did not read the statutory language to require the disclosure of a causal connection between abortion and suicide.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 894 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref> Rather, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] read the phrase \"increased risk\" in the statute to mean \"relative risk\" and to not require proof of causation.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 895 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref>\n\nAfter examining the record, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] concluded that \"the studies submitted by the State are sufficiently reliable to support the truth of the proposition that the relative risk of suicide and suicide ideation is higher for women who abort their pregnancies compared to women who give birth or have not become pregnant,\" and that this relative risk is generally \"known.\"<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 898-99 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref> The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] thus concluded that the disclosure mandated by the suicide advisory was truthful.\n\nPlanned Parenthood argued that the suicide advisory was misleading and irrelevant because the correlation between abortion and suicide was likely the result of other underlying factors, such as pre-existing mental health problems, which \"predispose some women both to have unwanted pregnancies and to have suicidal tendencies.\"<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 899 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref> The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] rejected this argument because it said that to render the advisory unconstitutionally misleading or irrelevant, Planned Parenthood would have to prove \"that abortion has been ruled out, to a degree of scientifically accepted certainty, as a [[Statistical significance|statistically significant]] causal factor in post-abortion suicides.\"<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 899 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref> \n\nPlanned Parenthood pointed to three main pieces of evidence to demonstrate that abortion was not considered a [[Statistical significance|statistically significant]] factor in post-abortion suicides. First, Planned Parenthood pointed out that the label approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (\"FDA\") for the abortion-inducing drug [[Mifeprex]] excluded suicide or suicide ideation as a risk of using the drug. Planned Parenthood argued that the absence of a suicide advisory from the FDA label for the drug was particularly significant given that the FDA requires drug labels to contain all \"clinically significant adverse reactions\" and \"other potential safety hazards.\"<ref>21 C.F.R. \u00a7 201.57(c)(6)(i).</ref><ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 899 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref> The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] rejected this argument, claiming that FDA-approved labels do not represent a definitive or exclusive list of risks associated with a given drug. Second, Planned Parenthood noted that the [[American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]] (\"ACOG\") summarily rejected the claim that suicide and suicide ideation are known risks of abortion.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 900 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref> The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] dismissed this point because it felt that there was insufficient information in the record regarding how [[American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists|ACOG]] came to this conclusion.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 900-01 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref> Third, Planned Parenthood cited a report prepared by the [[American Psychological Association]] (\"APA\") that reviewed 50 published peer-reviewed papers analyzing empirical data regarding the psychological outcomes of those who had abortions as compared to those who did not. The [[American Psychological Association|APA]] identified methodological deficiencies in all of the studies that found that there was an increased mental health risk associated with abortion.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 901 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref> The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] rejected the utility of this evidence because, although the [[American Psychological Association|APA]] report found that studies had yet to establish with certainty that abortion is a causal factor in post-abortion suicide, the report conversely did not prove that abortion was ruled out as a statistically significant causal factor in such suicides.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 901 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref> The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] also went on to reject other publications in the record which the dissent had suggested eliminated uncertainty about the absence of the causal role of abortion in increasing the risk of suicide.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 902 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref> The majority refused to give credence to these publications based on what it perceived to be methodological deficiencies in those studies.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 902-4 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref> \n\nThus, the majority of the [[en banc]] [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] concluded that although the record reflected medical and scientific uncertainty as to whether abortion was correlated with suicide, there was nothing in the record that proved that abortion had been entirely ruled out as a cause of suicide. Given that uncertainty, and since the majority read the record to suggest that the relative risk of suicide and suicide ideation was higher for women who abort as \"compared to women in other relevant groups,\"<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 905 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref> the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] concluded that the state legislature was \"in the best position to weigh the divergent results and come to a conclusion about the best way to protect its populace.\"<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 904 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref>\n\nThus, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] held that \"the suicide advisory present[ed] neither an [[Undue burden standard|undue burden]] on abortion rights not a violation of physicians' [[Freedom of speech|free speech]] rights.\"<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 906 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref> The Court, therefore, reversed the district court's grant of [[summary judgment]] to Planned Parenthood as to S.D.C.L. \u00a7 34\u201323A\u201310.1(1)(e)(ii), directed that [[summary judgment]] be awarded to the State as to that provision, and [[Vacated judgment|vacated]] the [[Injunction|permanent injunction]] that had precluded enforcement of that provision.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 906 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref>\n\n== Concurrences ==\n\n=== Judge Loken's Concurrence ===\n[[James B. Loken|Judge Loken]] wrote a brief concurrence in which he noted that he agreed with the dissent that the plain language of the statute regarding the medical risks disclosure \"strongly suggest[ed] legislative intent to require that a physician make an untruthful, misleading causation disclosure.\"<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 906 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref> Nevertheless, [[James B. Loken|Judge Loken]] joined the majority because he read the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]]'s decision as limiting the facial constitutionality of the statute to \"only a disclosure as to relative risk that the physician can adapt to fit his or her professional opinion of the conflicting medical research\" regarding abortion.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 906 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref>\n\n=== Judge Colloton's Concurrence ===\n[[Steven Colloton|Judge Colloton]] wrote a brief concurrence which almost exclusively endorsed the [[en banc]] panel's opinion. [[Steven Colloton|Judge Colloton]]'s only disagreement with the majority opinion was that he found \"it unnecessary to consider the meaning of the hypothetical phrase 'a description of all known medical risks of the procedure...to which the pregnant women would be subjected.'\"<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 906 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref>\n\n== Dissent ==\n[[Diana E. Murphy|Judge Murphy]] wrote a [[Dissenting opinion|dissent]]--joined by [[Roger Leland Wollman|Judge Wollman]], [[Kermit Edward Bye|Judge Bye]], and [[Michael Joseph Melloy|Judge Melloy]]--that sharply rebuked the majority opinion.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref> The dissent maintained that the district court had correctly concluded that South Dakota's mandatory disclosure law was unconstitutional, arguing that the law \"will not inform the free choice of a woman and is not consistent with the medical evidence.\"<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 907 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref>\n\nThe dissent characterized the majority as seeking \"to avoid the constitutional problem created by the current statutory text\" by claiming that the new statutory language--that is, the language challenged by Planned Parenthood in this case--\"merely inform[s] women that their decision to have an abortion would 'cause[] [them] to become a member of a group' with a statistically higher rate of suicide.\"<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 908 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref> The dissent pointed out that this was a flawed argument for two reasons. First, the majority's reading was inconsistent with the plain language of the statute.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 908 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref> Second, the medical evidence suggested that women sharing certain attributes might have a higher rate of suicide--not that abortion caused suicide.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 908 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref> In fact, the dissenters argued that the vast majority of researchers maintain that there is no causal relationship between abortion and suicide.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 911 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref>\n\nThe dissent focused, in part, on the changes made to the text of the South Dakota law. The dissenting judges argued that the statutory history should inform both the court's reading of the statute and the words contained therein. An earlier version of the law advised patients about the \"particular medical risks ''associated with'' the particular abortion procedure to be employed, including ''when medically accurate'', the risks of infection, hemorrhage, danger to subsequent pregnancies, and infertility.\"<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 907 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref> By contrast, the version of the statute which Planned Parenthood challenged in this case forced doctors to tell pregnant women that a greater likelihood of suicide and suicidal ideation is a \"''known medical risk''\" to which those women \"''would be subjected''\" by having an abortion.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 907 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref><ref>S.D. Codified Laws. \u00a734-23A-10.1(1)(e), available at https://sdlegislature.gov/Statutes/Codified_Laws/DisplayStatute.aspx?Type=Statute&Statute=34-23A-10.1. </ref> The dissent found the switch from \"risks associated with\" to \"would be subjected [to]\" dispositive as to the question of statutory intent; the statutory drafters meant the mandatory disclosure to convey casualty. This conclusion was supported by legislative findings.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 908 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref> \n\nThe dissent described the majority as having devised a test wherein, so long as there could theoretically be a casual link between abortion and suicide, a suicide advisory like South Dakota's would be considered truthful, non-misleading, and relevant--unless, that is, a plaintiff could prove the absence of the causal link with  \u201cscientifically accepted certainty.\"<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 910 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref> The majority created this test, the dissenters explained, because it had already conceded that if the correlation between abortion and suicide were not due to a causal relationship, the suicide advisory would be misleading or irrelevant, and thus unconstitutional. The dissent then pointed out the critical flaw in the majority's approach: the vast majority of researchers insisted that there was no causal relationship between abortion and suicide.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 910 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref> \n\nTo support its contention that the majority of researchers had concluded that abortion did not cause suicide, the dissent provided an overview of the extensive evidence in the record supporting that assertion. This evidence included the aforementioned [[American Psychological Association|APA]] report, [[American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists|ACOG]]'s most recent edition of medical opinions, and statements from the author of two of the studies upon which the state and intervenors had relied wherein the author rejected the contention that his findings suggested that abortion caused suicide. The dissent also noted that the State's expert had had her abortion studies publicly discredited.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 910 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref> The dissenting judges further pointed out that several of the other studies upon which the state and intervenors relied were ones that had been criticized for comparing pregnant women to a group \"irrelevant to a pregnant woman's decision to have an abortion.\"<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 909 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref> The dissenters went on to observe that in the time since the district court enjoined the suicide advisory and an Eighth Circuit panel affirmed that decision, the United Kingdom's [[Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists]] (\"RCOG\") issued guidance that women \"be informed that the evidence that suggests that they are no more or less likely to suffer adverse psychological [[Sequela|sequelae]] whether they have an abortion or continue with the pregnancy and have the baby.\"<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 909 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref> [[Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists|RCOG]] based its conclusion on a number of studies that established that \"post abortion suicide rates are linked to preexisting mental illness and [[domestic violence]], not to the decision to undergo an abortion.\"<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 910 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref>\n\nThe dissenters maintained that the state's interest in this case--to promote a \"wise,\" mature[,] and informed\" decision by women considering abortion<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Casey'', 505 U.S. 833, 887 (1992).</ref>--was thwarted by the suicide advisory.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 911 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref> The dissent argued that because the majority of medical research refutes the claim that abortion causes an increased risk of suicide, the state's failure to not inform a pregnant patient of that fact, compounded by its forcing doctors to tell the woman the opposite, hurt any valid interest the state might have and gravely undermined the constitutionality of the mandated advisory.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 911 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref>\n\nThe dissenters went on to note that, since Planned Parenthood's challenge, the South Dakota legislature and governor had amended its state abortion regulations to be more in line with the predominant \"view in the medical community that abortion does not cause mental health problems such as suicidal ideation and suicide.\"<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 911 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref> The new statutory language was consistent with the view that preexisting risk factors that may coincide with abortion were what lead to an increased risk of suicide.<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 912 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref>\n\nThe dissent concluded by stating that \"[b]y forcing doctors to inform women that abortion subjects them to a risk which the record medical evidence refutes, the suicide advisory places an undue burden on a pregnant woman's [[Due Process Clause|due process]] rights and violates a doctor's [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] right against [[compelled speech]].\"<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'', 686 F.3d 889, 912 (8th Cir. 2012).</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\nCommentators have criticized the decision that the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] reached in this case. Some have criticized informed consent provisions like those at issue in ''Planned Parenthood v. Rounds'' for \"not [being] scientifically sound and thus not 'truthful and nonmisleading.'\"<ref>John A. Robertson, ''Science Disputes in Abortion Law'', 93 Tex. L. Rev. 1849 (2015), available at http://texaslawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Robertson.Final_.pdf.</ref> Others criticized the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] for legitimizing \"a specific class of anti-abortion laws that are designed to 'unduly influence a woman's choice, in violation of the ethical boundaries of medical informed consent.'\"<ref>Kate Aizpuru, ''Planned Parenthood v.

Becerra]]'', 585 U.S. ___ (2018) (hereinafter \"''NIFLA''\"). In ''[[National Institute of Family and Life Advocates v. Becerra|NIFLA]]'', the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] addressed the constitutionality of California's Reproductive Freedom, Accountability, Comprehensive Care, and Transparency Act (\"FACT Act\"), which required [[Crisis pregnancy center|crisis pregnancy centers]] to provide clients with certain disclosures, including that abortions were available at state-sponsored clinics.<ref>''National Institute of Family and Life Advocates v. Becerra'', 585 U.S. ___ (2018), available at https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/16-1140_5368.pdf.</ref> The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Court]] ruled, in a 5-4 decision, that the notices required by the FACT Act violated the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] because they constituted government-[[compelled speech]] that targeted particular speakers, a speech regulation for which the state lacked a sufficient [[Compelling State Interest|compelling state interest]]. \n\nThe question of whether abortion providers are entitled to [[third-party standing]] to challenge abortion restrictions is currently up for [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] consideration in ''[[June Medical Services, LLC v.

A locally-built variant of the French [[25 mm Hotchkiss anti-aircraft gun|Hotchkiss 25mm anti-aircraft gun]], it was designed as a dual-purpose weapon for use against armored vehicles and aircraft, but was primarily used as an [[anti-aircraft gun]] in fixed mounts with one to three guns.\n\n==History and development==\nIn 1935 the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] decided to replace the earlier [[QF 2 pounder naval gun|40 mm Vickers \"pom-pom\" guns]] with a [[25 mm Hotchkiss anti-aircraft gun|25 mm Hotchkiss design]]. A party of Japanese officers and engineers traveled to France to evaluate the design in 1935, and an order was placed for a number of guns and mounts for evaluation. Firing tests of these guns were conducted at [[Yokosuka Naval Arsenal]] in 1935. The first few weapons were built in France under the designation \u201cType 94\u201d and \u201cType 95\u201d, with the mass production model produced at the Yokosuka Arsenal being designated \u201cType 96\u201d.\n\nThe Japanese made a number of minor changes to the original Hotchkiss design and production process, changing some components from forgings to castings to simplify production, and replacing the simple conical [[flash suppressor]] with a [[Rheinmetall]]-type design. A [[submarine]]-mountable version of the gun which made extensive use of [[stainless steel]] was also produced.\n\nThe double-mount type was the first to enter service, with triple mounts following in 1941 and finally single mounts later in 1943.\n\n==Design==\nThe Type 96 25mm Gun is a simple air-cooled [[gas operated]] design. The barrel is a forging screwed into the [[Breech-loading weapon|breech]] mechanism. Additional support is provided to the breech end of the [[gun barrel]] by the finned cooling jacket. The barrel is changeable, requiring two men and special tools; the operation took a trained crew approximately five minutes.<ref name=\"aaguns\"/> By adjusting the gas valve setting it was possible to vary the [[rate of fire]] between 200 and 260 rounds per minute, with 220 rounds per minute being the standard setting.\n\nThe gun mounts were normally provided with one of three [[gun sight]]s:\n# A ''Le Prieur'' mechanical lead computing sight\n# An open ring sight\n# An etched glass optical ring sight\n[[File:Japanese mechanical lead computing sight - detail.jpg|thumb|left|The ''Le Prieur'' mechanical lead computing sight.]]\nLand mountings and all single mountings all used the single open-ring sight. The Type 95 sight was used on ship-based multiple mounts, in the case where the mount has a powered drive linked to a fire director it was used as a backup.\n\nThe Type 95 sight was originally designed with a maximum target speed of 600 kilometers per hour; however, experience showed that aircraft often exceeded this speed. To compensate for the problem, a ring was added to the sighting telescope to provide an additional offset for speeds up to 900 kilometers per hour.\n\nThe gun was normally used without a [[gun shield]], although some multiple mounts on [[Yamato-class battleship|''Yamato''-class battleship]]s were fitted with Ducol (High tensile steel) shields.

The Japanese military estimated that it required an average of 1,500 rounds to shoot down an aircraft at a height of 1,000 meters and a range of 2,000 meters, and that fire beyond that range was completely ineffective. Later in the war, when ammunition supply was restricted, firing was held until the targets were within 800 meters range, dropping this ratio to as low as seven rounds per aircraft.<ref name=\"aaeffect\">{{cite book|title=Effectiveness of Japanese AA fire O-44|publisher=U.S. Naval Technical Mission To Japan|year=1946}}</ref>\n\nThe Type 96 was a mediocre weapon compared to its contemporaries in other navies. It was hampered by slow training and elevating speeds (even in power-operated triple mounts), excessive vibration and muzzle flash, and the fact that the ammunition feed was via a 15-round fixed magazine, which necessitated ceasing fire every time the magazine had to be changed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNJAP_25mm-60_mg.htm|title=Japan 25 mm/60 (1\") Type 96 Model 1|accessdate=14 Dec 2013}}</ref> According to \"US Naval Technical Mission to Japan report O-47(N)-2\", all magazines had to be loaded by hand as no specialized loading equipment was ever developed. Overall, it was more comparable to the [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|20mm Oerlikon]], though vastly inferior to the [[Bofors 40 mm gun|40mm Bofors]] weapons used by the US in every respect except rate of fire (and only barely in that respect: the Bofors could put out a sustained 120 round/minute because of its constant-fire top-fed ammo clip design, whereas the 25mm's frequent ammo box changes lowered its nominal rate of fire to only half of its theoretical maximum of 260 rounds per minute).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.combinedfleet.com/25_60.htm|title=Japanese Naval Ordnance, 25mm/60 caliber AA|accessdate=14 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe Japanese ranked in order of seriousness the problems with the gun as:\n# Elevation and traverse were too slow, even with powered mounts;\n# The sights were ineffective against high speed targets;\n# Firing the multiple mounts caused excessive vibration, which reduced accuracy and prevented effective target tracking;\n# Too little ammunition in each magazine resulted in a low overall rate of fire.\n\nIn ''Rapid Fire'', [[Anthony Williams (author)|Anthony Williams]] writes that the intermediate calibre weapons (including the US Navy's [[1.1\"/75 caliber gun]] 28\u00d7199mm L/75) were relatively unsuccessful during World War II: the mounts were much heavier and more complex than smaller-calibre guns, but the shells lacked the range and hitting power of the larger 37 and 40 millimeter mounts.<ref name=\"rapidfire\">{{cite book|title=Rapid Fire|author=Anthony G.

It was hampered by slow training and elevating speeds (even in power-operated triple mounts), excessive vibration and muzzle flash, and the fact that the ammunition feed was via a 15-round fixed magazine, which necessitated ceasing fire every time the magazine had to be changed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNJAP_25mm-60_mg.htm|title=Japan 25 mm/60 (1\") Type 96 Model 1|accessdate=14 Dec 2013}}</ref> According to \"US Naval Technical Mission to Japan report O-47(N)-2\", all magazines had to be loaded by hand as no specialized loading equipment was ever developed. Overall, it was more comparable to the [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|20mm Oerlikon]], though vastly inferior to the [[Bofors 40 mm gun|40mm Bofors]] weapons used by the US in every respect except rate of fire (and only barely in that respect: the Bofors could put out a sustained 120 round/minute because of its constant-fire top-fed ammo clip design, whereas the 25mm's frequent ammo box changes lowered its nominal rate of fire to only half of its theoretical maximum of 260 rounds per minute).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.combinedfleet.com/25_60.htm|title=Japanese Naval Ordnance, 25mm/60 caliber AA|accessdate=14 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe Japanese ranked in order of seriousness the problems with the gun as:\n# Elevation and traverse were too slow, even with powered mounts;\n# The sights were ineffective against high speed targets;\n# Firing the multiple mounts caused excessive vibration, which reduced accuracy and prevented effective target tracking;\n# Too little ammunition in each magazine resulted in a low overall rate of fire.\n\nIn ''Rapid Fire'', [[Anthony Williams (author)|Anthony Williams]] writes that the intermediate calibre weapons (including the US Navy's [[1.1\"/75 caliber gun]] 28\u00d7199mm L/75) were relatively unsuccessful during World War II: the mounts were much heavier and more complex than smaller-calibre guns, but the shells lacked the range and hitting power of the larger 37 and 40 millimeter mounts.<ref name=\"rapidfire\">{{cite book|title=Rapid Fire|author=Anthony G.

This had led to the distribution of weapons to military trained youths, which were largely confiscated from the Dutch armoury.\n\nAfter the Japanese occupation, the national police became an armed organisation.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} The Indonesian police was established on 19 August 1945 (under the title of the National Police Agency (''Badan Kepolisian Negara'')) and its units fought in the [[Indonesian National Revolution]] against the invading Dutch forces. The police also participated in suppressing the 1948 communist revolt in [[Madiun]]. In 1962, the police was brought under the control of the Commander of the National Armed Forces and the Ministry of Defence, becoming the Indonesian Police Forces (''Angkatan Kepolisian'').  Following the [[Indonesian Declaration of Independence|proclamation of independence]], the police played a vital role when they actively supported the people's movement to dismantle the Japanese army, and to strengthen the defence of the newly created Republic of Indonesia. The police were not combatants who were required to surrender their weapons to the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]]. During [[Indonesian National Revolution|the revolution of independence]], the police gradually formed into what is now known as ''Kepolisian Negara Republik Indonesia'' (Polri) or the Indonesian National Police.  In April 1999, the police force officially regained its independence and now is separate from the armed forces proper.\n\n1 June, which is marked as National Police Day (''Hari Bhayangkara''), honours the anniversary of the 1946 Cabinet resolution placing the INP as a national agency subordinated directly to the government of the Republic and thus responsible to the President (formerly the Prime Minister).\n\n==Duties and tasks==\n[[File:Sabhara Polri.jpg|thumb|280px|Indonesian police personnel in Jakarta]]\n[[File:Polisi officers lineup.jpg|thumb|280px|Indonesian armed Police officers and personnel line-up in [[Jakarta]]]]\nThe key tasks of the Indonesian National Police are to:\n* maintain security and public order;\n* enforce the law, and\n* provide protection, and service to the community.\n\nIn carrying out these basic tasks, Police are to:\n* perform control, guard, escort and patrol of the community and government activities as needed;\n* supplying all activities to ensure the safety and smoothness of traffic on the road;\n* to develop community awareness;\n* as well as in the development of national law;\n* implement order and ensure public safety;\n* implement co-ordination, supervision, and technical guidance to the investigators, civil servants/authorities, and the forms of private security;\n* implement the investigation against all criminal acts in accordance with the criminal procedure law and other legislation;\n* implement identification such as police medical operations, psychology, and police forensic laboratory for the interests of the police task;\n* Protect soul safety, property, society, and the environment from disturbances and/or disaster, including providing aid and relief to uphold human rights;\n* Serving interests of citizens for a while before it is handled by the agency and/or authorities;\n* Give services to the public in accordance with the interests of the police task environment;\n* to implement other duties in accordance with the legislation, which in practice regulated by Government Regulation;\n* Receive reports and/or complaints;\n* crowd and public control;\n* help resolve community disputes that may interfere with the public order;\n* supervising the flow that can lead to the dismemberment or threaten the unity of the nation;\n* publicising police regulations within the scope of police administrative authority;\n* implementing special examination as part of the police identification;\n* respond first and rapid action to a scene;\n* Take the identity, fingerprints and photograph of a person for identification purposes;\n* looking for information and evidence;\n* organising National Crime Information Centre;\n* issuing licence and / or certificate that is required to service the community;\n* Give security assistance in the trial and execution of court decisions, the activities of other agencies, as well as community activities; and\n* to Receive, secure, and keep founded lost items for a while until further identification\n\n==Organisation==\n[[File:Emblem of Indonesian police, Sekilas Lintas Kepolisian Republik Indonesia, p12.jpg|thumb|right|Indonesian National Police emblem]]\nThe organisation of the National Police of Indonesia (POLRI) is arranged in stages from the central level to the regional level. \nThe Headquarters of the Indonesian National Police is called ''\"Markas besar/Mabes Polri\"''. \n<br>The territorial Police organisation consists of: \n*POLDA: regional Police of the Republic of Indonesia, covering a [[Provinces of Indonesia|provincial]] level  (formerly Police Commissariats (''Kepolisan Komisariat''), Police Regional Directorates (''Komando Daerah Kepolisan'') and Police Territorial Directorates (''Polisi Wilayah''))\n*POLRES: Departmental (Resort) Police of the Republic of Indonesia (Polres) covering a [[Regencies of Indonesia|regency]] / city level (formerly Police Area Directorates (''Korem Polisi''))\n**POLRESTABES: capital/metropolitan city police\n**POLRESTA: city police\n**POLRES KABUPATEN: regency police\n*POLSEK: sectoral Police of the Republic of Indonesia for the sub-district (''[[Kecamatan]]'') level\n**POLSUBSEK: police for a smaller region in the sub-district (below POLSEK)\n\n===Headquarters===\n[[File:Mabes Polri, Indonesia Police HQ, Trunojoyo - panoramio.jpg|thumb|250px|Indonesian National Police Headquarters (Mabes Polri) in [[South Jakarta]]]]\n\n====Leadership element====\nThe head of the National Police Headquarters is the Chief of the Indonesian National Police (''Kepala Polisi Republik Indonesia / Kapolri'').

Susno's comment, as it turned out, quickly backfired because the image of a ''cicak'' standing up to a ''buaya'' (similar to [[David and Goliath]] imagery) immediately had wide appeal in Indonesia. A noisy popular movement in support of the ''cicak'' quickly emerged.  Students staged pro-''cicak'' demonstrations, many newspapers ran cartoons with ''cicaks'' lining up against an ugly ''buaya'', and numerous TV talk shows took up the ''cicak'' versus ''buaya'' topic with enthusiasm. As a result, references to ''cicaks'' fighting a ''buaya'' have become a well-known part of the political imagery of Indonesia.<ref>Antagonism between the KPK and the police, with memories of the ''cicak'' versus ''buaya'' clash, remained deeply embedded in the relationship between the KPK and the police after the clash.

This had led to the distribution of weapons to military trained youths, which were largely confiscated from the Dutch armoury.\n\nAfter the Japanese occupation, the national police became an armed organisation.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} The Indonesian police was established on 19 August 1945 (under the title of the National Police Agency (''Badan Kepolisian Negara'')) and its units fought in the [[Indonesian National Revolution]] against the invading Dutch forces. The police also participated in suppressing the 1948 communist revolt in [[Madiun]]. In 1962, the police was brought under the control of the Commander of the National Armed Forces and the Ministry of Defence, becoming the Indonesian Police Forces (''Angkatan Kepolisian'').  Following the [[Indonesian Declaration of Independence|proclamation of independence]], the police played a vital role when they actively supported the people's movement to dismantle the Japanese army, and to strengthen the defence of the newly created Republic of Indonesia. The police were not combatants who were required to surrender their weapons to the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]]. During [[Indonesian National Revolution|the revolution of independence]], the police gradually formed into what is now known as ''Kepolisian Negara Republik Indonesia'' (Polri) or the Indonesian National Police.  In April 1999, the police force officially regained its independence and now is separate from the armed forces proper.\n\n1 June, which is marked as National Police Day (''Hari Bhayangkara''), honours the anniversary of the 1946 Cabinet resolution placing the INP as a national agency subordinated directly to the government of the Republic and thus responsible to the President (formerly the Prime Minister).\n\n==Duties and tasks==\n[[File:Sabhara Polri.jpg|thumb|280px|Indonesian police personnel in Jakarta]]\n[[File:Polisi officers lineup.jpg|thumb|280px|Indonesian armed Police officers and personnel line-up in [[Jakarta]]]]\nThe key tasks of the Indonesian National Police are to:\n* maintain security and public order;\n* enforce the law, and\n* provide protection, and service to the community.\n\nIn carrying out these basic tasks, Police are to:\n* perform control, guard, escort and patrol of the community and government activities as needed;\n* supplying all activities to ensure the safety and smoothness of traffic on the road;\n* to develop community awareness;\n* as well as in the development of national law;\n* implement order and ensure public safety;\n* implement co-ordination, supervision, and technical guidance to the investigators, civil servants/authorities, and the forms of private security;\n* implement the investigation against all criminal acts in accordance with the criminal procedure law and other legislation;\n* implement identification such as police medical operations, psychology, and police forensic laboratory for the interests of the police task;\n* Protect soul safety, property, society, and the environment from disturbances and/or disaster, including providing aid and relief to uphold human rights;\n* Serving interests of citizens for a while before it is handled by the agency and/or authorities;\n* Give services to the public in accordance with the interests of the police task environment;\n* to implement other duties in accordance with the legislation, which in practice regulated by Government Regulation;\n* Receive reports and/or complaints;\n* crowd and public control;\n* help resolve community disputes that may interfere with the public order;\n* supervising the flow that can lead to the dismemberment or threaten the unity of the nation;\n* publicising police regulations within the scope of police administrative authority;\n* implementing special examination as part of the police identification;\n* respond first and rapid action to a scene;\n* Take the identity, fingerprints and photograph of a person for identification purposes;\n* looking for information and evidence;\n* organising National Crime Information Centre;\n* issuing licence and / or certificate that is required to service the community;\n* Give security assistance in the trial and execution of court decisions, the activities of other agencies, as well as community activities; and\n* to Receive, secure, and keep founded lost items for a while until further identification\n\n==Organisation==\n[[File:Emblem of Indonesian police, Sekilas Lintas Kepolisian Republik Indonesia, p12.jpg|thumb|right|Indonesian National Police emblem]]\nThe organisation of the National Police of Indonesia (POLRI) is arranged in stages from the central level to the regional level. \nThe Headquarters of the Indonesian National Police is called ''\"Markas besar/Mabes Polri\"''. \n<br>The territorial Police organisation consists of: \n*POLDA: regional Police of the Republic of Indonesia, covering a [[Provinces of Indonesia|provincial]] level  (formerly Police Commissariats (''Kepolisan Komisariat''), Police Regional Directorates (''Komando Daerah Kepolisan'') and Police Territorial Directorates (''Polisi Wilayah''))\n*POLRES: Departmental (Resort) Police of the Republic of Indonesia (Polres) covering a [[Regencies of Indonesia|regency]] / city level (formerly Police Area Directorates (''Korem Polisi''))\n**POLRESTABES: capital/metropolitan city police\n**POLRESTA: city police\n**POLRES KABUPATEN: regency police\n*POLSEK: sectoral Police of the Republic of Indonesia for the sub-district (''[[Kecamatan]]'') level\n**POLSUBSEK: police for a smaller region in the sub-district (below POLSEK)\n\n===Headquarters===\n[[File:Mabes Polri, Indonesia Police HQ, Trunojoyo - panoramio.jpg|thumb|250px|Indonesian National Police Headquarters (Mabes Polri) in [[South Jakarta]]]]\n\n====Leadership element====\nThe head of the National Police Headquarters is the Chief of the Indonesian National Police (''Kepala Polisi Republik Indonesia / Kapolri'').

Susno's comment, as it turned out, quickly backfired because the image of a ''cicak'' standing up to a ''buaya'' (similar to [[David and Goliath]] imagery) immediately had wide appeal in Indonesia. A noisy popular movement in support of the ''cicak'' quickly emerged.  Students staged pro-''cicak'' demonstrations, many newspapers ran cartoons with ''cicaks'' lining up against an ugly ''buaya'', and numerous TV talk shows took up the ''cicak'' versus ''buaya'' topic with enthusiasm. As a result, references to ''cicaks'' fighting a ''buaya'' have become a well-known part of the political imagery of Indonesia.<ref>Antagonism between the KPK and the police, with memories of the ''cicak'' versus ''buaya'' clash, remained deeply embedded in the relationship between the KPK and the police after the clash.

While police personnel attached to special units such as [[Detachment 88]], Gegana and [[Mobile Brigade (Indonesia)|BRIMOB]] are issued with the [[Glock 17]] semi-automatic pistol.\n\nHeavy arms are always available to Indonesian police personnel, such as the [[Heckler & Koch MP5]] sub-machine gun, [[Remington 870]] shotgun, [[Steyr AUG]] assault rifle, [[M4 carbine]], [[M1 Carbine]]. and other weapons. The standard rifle for the Indonesian National Police are the [[Pindad SS1]] and the [[M16 rifle]]. Units are also issued the [[Pindad SS1#Variants|\"Sabhara\"/Police V1-V2 Pindad SS1]] special law enforcement assault rifle.\n\n==Police fleets==\n{{Further|#Police vehicles}}\nThe police vehicles that are usually operated by the Indonesian Police (\"Polri\") for patrol and [[law enforcement]] activities are mainly [[Ford Focus]] [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]]s, [[Mitsubishi Lancer]]s, [[Hyundai Elantra]]s (for some police regions), [[Mitsubishi Strada]]s, [[Isuzu D-Max]]s, and [[Mazda BT-50#Ford Ranger|Ford Ranger]]s. Such vehicles are usually operated by the \"Sabhara\" police unit and other units which the vehicles are mainly colored dark-[[grey]].

Police laboratory and forensics (\"Puslabfor\") units are issued dark-grey police [[Suzuki APV]] vehicles.\n\nThe Traffic Police Corps (\"Korlantas\") usually uses vehicles such as the [[Mazda 6]], [[Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution]], [[Toyota Vios]], [[Ford Focus]] sedans, [[Hyundai Elantra]] and [[Mazda BT-50#Ford Ranger|Ford Ranger]]s coloured white and blue. Some vehicles for traffic patrol are also used such as the [[Toyota Rush]] and [[Daihatsu Terios]]. [[Sedan (automobile)|Sedan]] types are usually used for highway and road patrolling and escort. [[Pickup truck|Double-Cab]] types are usually used for Traffic incidents and traffic management law enforcement activities.\n\nPolice vehicles coloured [[orange color|orange]] usually [[Ford Focus]] and [[Mitsubishi Lancer]] sedans and white-[[orange color|orange]] [[Chevrolet Captiva]]s are operated by the Vital Object Protection unit (\"Pam Obvit\") and usually parked outside and operated for international embassies, airports, and other special specified locations.

Vehicles are coloured dark-grey with the bumper coloured [[orange color|orange]] identifying vehicles of the special police units. Some special operational \"Gegana\" and \"Densus 88\" vehicles are coloured [[black color|black]] also with [[orange color|orange]] bumpers.\n\nOther customised vehicles used for mobilisation of police personnel are usually modified [[Suzuki APV#Mega Carry|Suzuki Mega Carry]]s, [[Isuzu Elf]]s and [[Toyota Dyna]]s with horizontal side sitting facilities inside of the trunk covered by dark colored canvas for canopy. Costumed patrol pick-ups with mounted sitting facilities on the trunk covered with canopy are also operated by the police to carry police personnel during [[patrol]], the pick-ups are usually [[Isuzu Panther]] pick-ups and usually operate in rural areas.\n\nFor high-ranking officers (usually generals), issued cars are usually grey (some black) full to compact [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]]s and Mid to Full-sized [[SUV]]s.

{"title_page": "Molecular cytogenetics", "text_new": "{{For|the academic journal|Molecular Cytogenetics}}\n'''Molecular cytogenetics''' combines two disciplines, [[molecular biology]] and [[cytogenetics]], and involves the analyzation of chromosome structure to help distinguish normal and cancer-causing cells. Human cytogenetics began in 1956 when it was discovered that normal human cells contain 46 chromosomes. However, the first microscopic observations of chromosomes were reported by Arnold, Flemming, and Hansemann in the late 1800's. Their work was ignored for decades until the actual chromosome number in humans was discovered as 46. In 1879, Arnold examined sarcoma and carcinoma cells having very large nuclei. Today, the study of molecular cytogenetics can be useful in diagnosing and treating various malignancies such as hematological malignancies, brain tumors, and other precursors of cancer. The field is overall focused on studying the evolution of chromosomes, more specifically the number, structure, function, and origin of chromosome abnormalities.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kearney L, Horsley SW | title = Molecular cytogenetics in haematological malignancy: current technology and future prospects | journal = Chromosoma | volume = 114 | issue = 4 | pages = 286\u201394 | date = September 2005 | pmid = 16003502 | doi = 10.1007/s00412-005-0002-z }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bigner SH, Schr\u00f6ck E | title = Molecular cytogenetics of brain tumors | journal = Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology | volume = 56 | issue = 11 | pages = 1173\u201381 | date = November 1997 | pmid = 9370227 | doi = 10.1097/00005072-199711000-00001 }}</ref> It includes a series of techniques referred to as [[fluorescence in situ hybridization|fluorescence ''in situ'' hybridization]], or FISH, in which [[DNA]] probes are labeled with different colored fluorescent tags to visualize one or more specific regions of the genome. Introduced in the 1980's, FISH uses probes with complimentary base sequences to locate the presence or absence of the specific DNA regions you are looking for.

Human cytogenetics began in 1956 when it was discovered that normal human cells contain 46 chromosomes. However, the first microscopic observations of chromosomes were reported by Arnold, Flemming, and Hansemann in the late 1800's. Their work was ignored for decades until the actual chromosome number in humans was discovered as 46. In 1879, Arnold examined sarcoma and carcinoma cells having very large nuclei. Today, the study of molecular cytogenetics can be useful in diagnosing and treating various malignancies such as hematological malignancies, brain tumors, and other precursors of cancer.

He was born in the town of [[Villa Union]] in the state of [[Durango]], [[Mexico]], but now  resides in [[Aguanga, California]]. He is unmarried and has two daughters, Lianna and Arabi. He originally worked as a [[cowboy boot]]s salesman and a construction worker, but a construction accident caused him to leave the latter job. He made a metal sculpture of a ''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' for his daughter Lianna after she asked for a dinosaur for [[Christmas]] following a viewing of ''[[Jurassic Park III]]''.\n\nHe continued work on sculptures, and was eventually discovered by a philanthropist named Dennis Avery who paid him to construct one piece that then resulted in more than 100 sculptures on his property at [[Galleta Meadows Estate]] based on beasts found in a book he funded that depicts now-fossilized creatures in the [[Anza Borrego Desert State Park|Anza Borrego Desert]] as well as mythological creatures. Notable statues made by Breceda include a stagecoach pulled by horses, a large serpent, and a Tyrannosaurus rex.\n\nBreceda was the subject of a book called \"Ricardo Breceda: Accidental Artist\", and his art was cited by both [[The Huffington Post]] and the ''[[Union Tribune San Diego]]'' as reasons why people should visit the Anza-Borrego Desert.

He was born in the town of [[Villa Union]] in the state of [[Durango]], [[Mexico]], but now  resides in [[Aguanga, California]]. He is unmarried and has two daughters, Lianna and Arabi. He originally worked as a [[cowboy boot]]s salesman and a construction worker, but a construction accident caused him to leave the latter job. He made a metal sculpture of a ''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' for his daughter Lianna after she asked for a dinosaur for [[Christmas]] following a viewing of ''[[Jurassic Park III]]''.\n\nHe continued work on sculptures, and was eventually discovered by a philanthropist named Dennis Avery who paid him to construct one piece that then resulted in more than 100 sculptures on his property at [[Galleta Meadows Estate]] based on beasts found in a book he funded that depicts now-fossilized creatures in the [[Anza Borrego Desert State Park|Anza Borrego Desert]] as well as mythological creatures. Notable statues made by Breceda include a stagecoach pulled by horses, a large serpent, and a Tyranosaurus rex.\n\nBreceda was the subject of a book called \"Ricardo Breceda: Accidental Artist\", and his art was cited by both [[The Huffington Post]] and the ''[[Union Tribune San Diego]]'' as reasons why people should visit the Anza-Borrego Desert.
