Although I'm told that some people worry that his swing is too long, it looked fine to me. \"Long swings\" usually show up in the stat line as excessive strikeout totals, but Kinsler is not a whiff king. He works the count well, controlling the strike zone without trouble and not swinging at pitches outside the plate area. His bat has some pop in it, particularly to the gaps, where he rifles frequent extra-base shots. He already has above-average power for a player his size, and I think he has enough bat speed to keep hitting home runs at higher levels. Defensively, he shows slightly above-average range and good hands. His arm strength is average, but he's accurate with his throws and seems fundamentally sound, although his error rate is higher than ideal (20 in 71 games at Frisco). He might end up at second base eventually. Kinsler's running speed is a bit better than average, but he's fairly aggressive on the bases and will steal if the opportunity is there.

His swing looked short, quick, and sharp. Although I'm told that some people worry that his swing is too long, it looked fine to me. \"Long swings\" usually show up in the stat line as excessive strikeout totals, but Kinsler is not a whiff king. He works the count well, controlling the strike zone without trouble and not swinging at pitches outside the plate area. His bat has some pop in it, particularly to the gaps, where he rifles frequent extra-base shots. He already has above-average power for a player his size, and I think he has enough bat speed to keep hitting home runs at higher levels. Defensively, he shows slightly above-average range and good hands. His arm strength is average, but he's accurate with his throws and seems fundamentally sound, although his error rate is higher than ideal (20 in 71 games at Frisco). He might end up at second base eventually. Kinsler's running speed is a bit better than average, but he's fairly aggressive on the bases and will steal if the opportunity is there.

The hill rises above the city to a height of {{convert|250.5|m|abbr=on}}, provides excellent panoramic views of the city and beyond, is relatively easy to climb, and is popular for [[hillwalking]]. Though it can be climbed from almost any direction, the easiest and simplest ascent is from the east, where a grassy slope rises above [[Dunsapie Loch]]. At a spur of the hill, [[Salisbury Crags]] has historically been a [[rock climbing]] venue with routes of various degrees of difficulty, but due to hazards, rock climbing is now restricted to the South Quarry and a permit is required.\n\n== Name ==\nIt is sometimes said that its name is derived from legends pertaining to [[King Arthur]], such as the reference in ''[[Y Gododdin]]''. Some support for this may be provided by several other hilltop and mountaintop features in Britain which bear the same or similar names, such as the peak of Ben Arthur ([[The Cobbler]]) in the western highlands, sometimes known as Arthur's Seat,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ukhillwalking.com/articles/page.php?id=3381|title=Hill Names and the John Smith Question|date=April 2011|accessdate=25 December 2013}}</ref> and Arthur's Chair on the ridge called [[Stone Arthur]] in the Cumbrian lake district. There is no traditional [[Scottish Gaelic]] name for Arthur's Seat in Edinburgh, but William Maitland proposed that the name was a corruption of ''\u00c0rd-na-Said'', implying the \"Height of Arrows\", which over the years became Arthur's Seat (perhaps via \"Archer's Seat\").<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Grant | first1 = James | title = Old and New Edinburgh | url = http://www.oldandnewedinburgh.co.uk/volume4/page125.html | accessdate = 30 October 2010}}</ref> Alternatively, John Milne's proposed etymology of ''\u00c0rd-thir Suidhe'' meaning \"place on high ground\" uncomfortably requires the transposition of the name elements.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/gaelicplacenames00milnuoft|title=Gaelic place names of the Lothians|first=John|last=Milne|date=10 April 1912|publisher=London For the author by McDougall's educational company, limited|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>\n\n== Natural heritage ==\n[[File:Arthur's Seat, Edinburgh.JPG|thumb|600px|centre|Arthur's Seat]]\nArthur's Seat is the largest of the three parts of the Arthur's Seat Volcano [[site of special scientific interest]] (the other parts being [[Calton Hill]] and the [[Castle Rock (Edinburgh)|Castle Rock]]) which is designated to protect its important geology (see below), grassland habitats and uncommon plant and animal species.\n\nLike the rock on which Edinburgh Castle is built, it was formed by an [[extinct volcano]] system of [[Carboniferous]] age (lava samples have been dated at 341 to 335 million years old),<ref name=\"MonaghanEtAl2014\">{{cite journal | url=http://sjg.geoscienceworld.org/content/50/2/165 | title=An improved chronology for the Arthur\u2019s Seat volcano and Carboniferous magmatism of the Midland Valley of Scotland | author=Alison A.

[[Edinburgh]].]]\nArthur's Seat and the Salisbury Crags adjoining it helped form the ideas of modern geology as it is currently understood. It was in these areas that [[James Hutton]] observed that the deposition of the [[sedimentary]] and formation of the [[igneous]] rocks must have occurred at different ages and in different ways than the thinking of that time said they did. It is possible to see a particular area known as Hutton's Section in the Salisbury Crags where the magma forced its way through the sedimentary rocks above it to form the [[dolerite]] sills that can be seen in the Section.\n\nThe hill bears a strong resemblance to the [[Cavehill]] in [[Belfast]] in terms of its geology and proximity to a major urban site.\n\n== Human history ==\n[[File:Panorama SalisburyCrags.jpg|thumb|Panorama of Salisbury Crags and Arthur's Seat]]\nA [[hill fort]] occupies the summit of Arthur's Seat and the subsidiary hill, Crow Hill.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/52561/details/edinburgh+holyrood+park+arthur+s+seat/ | title = Edinburgh, Holyrood Park, Arthur'sSeat | accessdate = 5 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nHill fort defences are visible round the main massif of Arthur's Seat at [[Dunsapie Hill]] and above [[Samson's Ribs]], in the latter cases certainly of prehistoric date. These forts are likely to have been centres of power of the [[Votadini]], who were the subject of the poem ''[[Y Gododdin|Y&nbsp;Gododdin]]'' which is thought to have been written about 600&nbsp;[[AD]].\nTwo stony banks on the east side of the hill represent the remains of an [[Iron Age]] hill-fort and a series of cultivation terraces are obvious above the road just beyond and best viewed from Duddingston.\n\n[[File:Arthur's Seat from Edinburgh Castle.jpg|thumb|left|Arthur's Seat from [[Edinburgh Castle]]]]\nOn 1 May 1590 to celebrate the safe return of [[James VI of Scotland]] and [[Anne of Denmark|Anna of Denmark]], a bonfire was lit that night on the Salisbury Crags fuelled with ten loads of coal and six barrels of tar.<ref>[[Marguerite Wood]], [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015068454498&view=1up&seq=363 ''Extracts from the Burgh Records of Edinburgh: 1589\u20131603'', vol. 6 (Edinburgh, 1927), p. 331.]</ref>\n\nA track rising along the top of the slope immediately under Salisbury Crags has long been a popular walk, giving a view over the city. It became known as the Radical Road after it was paved in the aftermath of the [[Radical War]] of 1820, using the labour of unemployed weavers from the west of Scotland at the suggestion of [[Walter Scott]] as a form of work relief.<ref name=\"urlOverview of Salisbury Crags\">{{cite web |url=http://www.scottish-places.info/features/featurefirst250.html |title=Overview of Salisbury Crags |accessdate=30 August 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1836 five boys hunting for rabbits found a set of 17 miniature coffins containing small wooden figures in a cave on the crags of Arthur's Seat. The purpose has remained a mystery ever since the discovery. A strong contemporary belief was that they were made for witchcraft, though more recently it has been suggested that they might be connected with the murders committed by [[Burke and Hare]] in 1828.<ref>S P Menefee, A D C Simpson, The West Port Murders and the Miniature Coffins From Arthur's Seat in The Book of the Old Edinburgh Club, New Series vol.3, Edinburgh 1994, pp.63\u201381</ref> There were 16 known victims of the serial-killers plus the first person sold \"to the doctors\", namely a man who had died of natural causes. However, the murder victims were primarily female, while the eight surviving figures are male. Alternatively, the coffins may have represented the 16 bodies sold to the doctors, plus that of the final victim who remained unburied at the time of the duo's arrest, but was, as a destitute beggar, very likely dissected in any case. The surviving coffins are now displayed in Edinburgh's [[Royal Museum]].\n\nThe prominence of Arthur's Seat over Edinburgh has attracted various groups and has a particular significance to the history of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], because this is where the nation of Scotland was dedicated in 1840 \"for the preaching of the gospel\".<ref>{{citation |last= Evans |first= Richard L. |authorlink= Richard L.

The hill rises above the city to a height of {{convert|250.5|m|abbr=on}}, provides excellent panoramic views of the city and beyond, is relatively easy to climb, and is popular for [[hillwalking]]. Though it can be climbed from almost any direction, the easiest and simplest ascent is from the east, where a grassy slope rises above [[Dunsapie Loch]]. At a spur of the hill, [[Salisbury Crags]] has historically been a [[rock climbing]] venue with routes of various degrees of difficulty, but due to hazards, rock climbing is now restricted to the South Quarry and a permit is required.\n\n== Name ==\nIt is sometimes said that its name is derived from legends pertaining to [[King Arthur]], such as the reference in ''[[Y Gododdin]]''.

It was in these areas that [[James Hutton]] observed that the deposition of the [[sedimentary]] and formation of the [[igneous]] rocks must have occurred at different ages and in different ways than the thinking of that time said they did. It is possible to see a particular area known as Hutton's Section in the Salisbury Crags where the magma forced its way through the sedimentary rocks above it to form the [[dolerite]] sills that can be seen in the Section.\n\nThe hill bears a strong resemblance to the [[Cavehill]] in [[Belfast]] in terms of its geology and proximity to a major urban site.\n\n== Human history ==\n[[File:Panorama SalisburyCrags.jpg|thumb|Panorama of Salisbury Crags and Arthur's Seat]]\nA [[hill fort]] occupies the summit of Arthur's Seat and the subsidiary hill, Crow Hill.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/52561/details/edinburgh+holyrood+park+arthur+s+seat/ | title = Edinburgh, Holyrood Park, Arthur'sSeat | accessdate = 5 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nHill fort defences are visible round the main massif of Arthur's Seat at [[Dunsapie Hill]] and above [[Samson's Ribs]], in the latter cases certainly of prehistoric date.

The purpose has remained a mystery ever since the discovery. A strong contemporary belief was that they were made for witchcraft, though more recently it has been suggested that they might be connected with the murders committed by [[Burke and Hare]] in 1828.<ref>S P Menefee, A D C Simpson, The West Port Murders and the Miniature Coffins From Arthur's Seat in The Book of the Old Edinburgh Club, New Series vol.3, Edinburgh 1994, pp.63\u201381</ref> There were 16 known victims of the serial-killers plus the first person sold \"to the doctors\", namely a man who had died of natural causes. However, the murder victims were primarily female, while the eight surviving figures are male. Alternatively, the coffins may have represented the 16 bodies sold to the doctors, plus that of the final victim who remained unburied at the time of the duo's arrest, but was, as a destitute beggar, very likely dissected in any case. The surviving coffins are now displayed in Edinburgh's [[Royal Museum]].\n\nThe prominence of Arthur's Seat over Edinburgh has attracted various groups and has a particular significance to the history of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], because this is where the nation of Scotland was dedicated in 1840 \"for the preaching of the gospel\".<ref>{{citation |last= Evans |first= Richard L. |authorlink= Richard L.
