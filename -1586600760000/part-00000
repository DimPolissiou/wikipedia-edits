This means that there are rules in place (or [[best practice]]), the situation is stable, and the relationship between cause and effect is clear: if you do X, expect Y. The advice in such a situation is to \"sense\u2013categorize\u2013respond\": establish the facts (\"sense\"), categorize, then respond by following the rule or applying best practice. Snowden and Boone (2007) offer the example of loan-payment processing. An employee identifies the problem (for example, a borrower has paid less than required), categorizes it (reviews the loan documents), and responds (follows the terms of the loan).<ref name=SnowdenBoone2007/> According to [[Thomas A. Stewart]],\n\n<blockquote>This is the domain of legal structures, standard operating procedures, practices that are proven to work. Never draw to an [[Draw (poker)#Inside straight draw|inside straight]]. Never lend to a client whose monthly payments exceed 35 percent of gross income. Never end the meeting without asking for the sale. Here, decision-making lies squarely in the realm of reason: Find the proper rule and apply it.<ref name=\"Stewart2002pp4-5\">{{cite news|last1=Stewart|first1=Thomas A.|title=How to Think With Your Gut|url=http://www.business2.com:80/articles/mag/0,1640,44584%7c2,FF.html|work=Business 2.0|date=November 2002|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021105114814/http://www.business2.com/articles/mag/0,1640,44584%7c2,FF.html|archivedate=5 November 2002|pages=4\u20135|url-status=dead|access-date=13 July 2019}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nSnowden and Boone write that managers should beware of forcing situations into this domain by over-simplifying, by \"entrained thinking\" (being blind to new ways of thinking), or by becoming complacent. When success breeds complacency (\"best practice is, by definition, past practice\"), there can be a catastrophic clockwise shift into the chaotic domain. They recommend that leaders provide a communication channel, if necessary an anonymous one, so that dissenters (for example, within a workforce) can warn about complacency.<ref name=SnowdenBoone2007/>\n\n===Complicated===\nThe ''complicated'' domain consists of the \"known unknowns\". The relationship between cause and effect requires analysis or expertise; there are a range of right answers. The framework recommends \"sense\u2013analyze\u2013respond\": assess the facts, analyze, and apply the appropriate good operating practice.<ref name=SnowdenBoone2007/> According to Stewart: \"Here it is possible to work rationally toward a decision, but doing so requires refined judgment and expertise.&nbsp;... This is the province of engineers, surgeons, intelligence analysts, lawyers, and other experts. Artificial intelligence copes well here: [[Deep Blue (chess computer)|Deep Blue]] plays chess as if it were a complicated problem, looking at every possible sequence of moves.\"<ref name=\"Stewart2002pp4-5\"/>\n\n===Complex===\nThe ''complex'' domain represents the \"unknown unknowns\". Cause and effect can only be deduced in retrospect, and there are no right answers. \"Instructive patterns&nbsp;... can emerge,\" write Snowden and Boone, \"if the leader conducts experiments that are safe to fail.\" Cynefin calls this process \"probe\u2013sense\u2013respond\".<ref name=SnowdenBoone2007/> Hard insurance cases are one example. \"Hard cases&nbsp;... need human underwriters,\" Stewart writes, \"and the best all do the same thing: Dump the file and spread out the contents.\" Stewart identifies battlefields, markets, ecosystems and corporate cultures as complex systems that are \"impervious to a reductionist, take-it-apart-and-see-how-it-works approach, because your very actions change the situation in unpredictable ways.\"<ref name=\"Stewart2002pp4-5\"/>\n\n===Chaotic===\nIn the ''chaotic'' domain, cause and effect are unclear.{{efn|Cynefin uses ''chaotic'' in the ordinary sense, rather than in the sense used in [[chaos theory]].{{sfnp|Berger|Johnston|2015|loc=237, n.&nbsp;11}}}} Events in this domain are \"too confusing to wait for a knowledge-based response\", writes Patrick Lambe. \"Action\u2014''any'' action\u2014is the first and only way to respond appropriately.\"<ref>Lambe, Patrick (2007). ''Organising Knowledge: Taxonomies, Knowledge and Organisational Effectiveness''. Oxford: Chandos Publishing, 136.</ref> In this context, managers \"act\u2013sense\u2013respond\": ''act'' to establish order; ''sense'' where stability lies; ''respond'' to turn the chaotic into the complex.<ref name=SnowdenBoone2007/> Snowden and Boone write:\n\n<blockquote>In the chaotic domain, a leader\u2019s immediate job is not to discover patterns but to staunch the bleeding. A leader must first act to establish order, then sense where stability is present and from where it is absent, and then respond by working to transform the situation from chaos to complexity, where the identification of emerging patterns can both help prevent future crises and discern new opportunities. Communication of the most direct top-down or broadcast kind is imperative; there\u2019s simply no time to ask for input.<ref name=SnowdenBoone2007/></blockquote>\n\nThe [[September 11 attacks]] were an example of the ''chaotic'' category.<ref name=SnowdenBoone2007/> Stewart offers others: \"the firefighter whose gut makes him turn left or the trader who instinctively sells when the news about the stock seems too good to be true.\" One [[Crisis management|crisis executive]] said of the [[Enron scandal|collapse of Enron]]: \"People were afraid.&nbsp;... Decision-making was paralyzed.&nbsp;... You've got to be quick and decisive\u2014make little steps you know will succeed, so you can begin to tell a story that makes sense.\"<ref name=\"Stewart2002pp4-5\"/>\n\nSnowden and Boone give the example of the 1993 [[Brown's Chicken massacre]] in [[Palatine]], Illinois\u2014when robbers murdered seven employees in Brown's Chicken and Pasta restaurant\u2014as a situation in which local police faced all the domains. Deputy Police Chief Walt Gasior had to act immediately to stem the early panic (''chaotic''), while keeping the department running (''simple''), calling in experts (''complicated''), and maintaining community confidence in the following weeks (''complex'').<ref name=SnowdenBoone2007/>\n\n===Disorder / Confusion===\nThe dark ''disorder'' domain in the centre represents situations where there is no clarity about which of the other domains apply. By definition it is hard to see when this domain applies. \"Here, multiple perspectives jostle for prominence, factional leaders argue with one another, and cacophony rules\", write Snowden and Boone. \"The way out of this realm is to break down the situation into constituent parts and assign each to one of the other four realms. Leaders can then make decisions and intervene in contextually appropriate ways.\"<ref name=SnowdenBoone2007/>\n\n===Moving through domains===\nAs knowledge increases, there is a \"clockwise drift\" from ''chaotic'' through ''complex'' and ''complicated'' to ''simple''. Similarly, a \"buildup of biases\", complacency or lack of maintenance can cause a \"catastrophic failure\": a clockwise movement from ''simple'' to ''chaotic'', represented by the \"fold\" between those domains. There can be counter-clockwise movement as people die and knowledge is forgotten, or as new generations question the rules; and a counter-clockwise push from ''chaotic'' to ''simple'' can occur when a lack of order causes rules to be imposed suddenly.<ref name=KurtzSnowden2003/><ref name=SnowdenBoone2007/>\n\n== Applications and reception==\n[[File:Leader's Framework for Policing Protest.gif|thumb|upright=1.2|Using the Cynefin framework to analyse policing of the [[Occupy movement]] in the United States<ref name=Geron2014/>]]\nCynefin was used by its IBM developers in policy-making, product development, market creation, [[supply chain management]], [[Brand management|branding]] and [[customer relations]].<ref name=KurtzSnowden2003>{{cite journal|last1=Kurtz |first1=Cynthia F. |last2=Snowden |first2=David J. |title=The new dynamics of strategy: Sense-making in a complex and complicated world |journal=IBM Systems Journal |date=2003 |volume=42 |issue=3 |pages=462\u2013483 |doi=10.1147/sj.423.0462 |url=http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~brooks/storybiz/kurtz.pdf |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060918205828/http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~brooks/storybiz/kurtz.pdf |archivedate=18 September 2006 }}</ref> Later uses include analysing the impact of religion on policymaking within the [[George W.

This means that there are rules in place (or [[best practice]]), the situation is stable, and the relationship between cause and effect is clear: if you do X, expect Y. The advice in such a situation is to \"sense\u2013categorize\u2013respond\": establish the facts (\"sense\"), categorize, then respond by following the rule or applying best practice. Snowden and Boone (2007) offer the example of loan-payment processing. An employee identifies the problem (for example, a borrower has paid less than required), categorizes it (reviews the loan documents), and responds (follows the terms of the loan).<ref name=SnowdenBoone2007/> According to [[Thomas A. Stewart]],\n\n<blockquote>This is the domain of legal structures, standard operating procedures, practices that are proven to work. Never draw to an [[Draw (poker)#Inside straight draw|inside straight]]. Never lend to a client whose monthly payments exceed 35 percent of gross income. Never end the meeting without asking for the sale. Here, decision-making lies squarely in the realm of reason: Find the proper rule and apply it.<ref name=\"Stewart2002pp4-5\">{{cite news|last1=Stewart|first1=Thomas A.|title=How to Think With Your Gut|url=http://www.business2.com:80/articles/mag/0,1640,44584%7c2,FF.html|work=Business 2.0|date=November 2002|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021105114814/http://www.business2.com/articles/mag/0,1640,44584%7c2,FF.html|archivedate=5 November 2002|pages=4\u20135|url-status=dead|access-date=13 July 2019}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nSnowden and Boone write that managers should beware of forcing situations into this domain by over-simplifying, by \"entrained thinking\" (being blind to new ways of thinking), or by becoming complacent. When success breeds complacency (\"best practice is, by definition, past practice\"), there can be a catastrophic clockwise shift into the chaotic domain. They recommend that leaders provide a communication channel, if necessary an anonymous one, so that dissenters (for example, within a workforce) can warn about complacency.<ref name=SnowdenBoone2007/>\n\n===Complicated===\nThe ''complicated'' domain consists of the \"known unknowns\". The relationship between cause and effect requires analysis or expertise; there are a range of right answers. The framework recommends \"sense\u2013analyze\u2013respond\": assess the facts, analyze, and apply the appropriate good operating practice.<ref name=SnowdenBoone2007/> According to Stewart: \"Here it is possible to work rationally toward a decision, but doing so requires refined judgment and expertise.&nbsp;... This is the province of engineers, surgeons, intelligence analysts, lawyers, and other experts. Artificial intelligence copes well here: [[Deep Blue (chess computer)|Deep Blue]] plays chess as if it were a complicated problem, looking at every possible sequence of moves.\"<ref name=\"Stewart2002pp4-5\"/>\n\n===Complex===\nThe ''complex'' domain represents the \"unknown unknowns\". Cause and effect can only be deduced in retrospect, and there are no right answers. \"Instructive patterns&nbsp;... can emerge,\" write Snowden and Boone, \"if the leader conducts experiments that are safe to fail.\" Cynefin calls this process \"probe\u2013sense\u2013respond\".<ref name=SnowdenBoone2007/> Hard insurance cases are one example. \"Hard cases&nbsp;... need human underwriters,\" Stewart writes, \"and the best all do the same thing: Dump the file and spread out the contents.\" Stewart identifies battlefields, markets, ecosystems and corporate cultures as complex systems that are \"impervious to a reductionist, take-it-apart-and-see-how-it-works approach, because your very actions change the situation in unpredictable ways.\"<ref name=\"Stewart2002pp4-5\"/>\n\n===Chaotic===\nIn the ''chaotic'' domain, cause and effect are unclear.{{efn|Cynefin uses ''chaotic'' in the ordinary sense, rather than in the sense used in [[chaos theory]].{{sfnp|Berger|Johnston|2015|loc=237, n.&nbsp;11}}}} Events in this domain are \"too confusing to wait for a knowledge-based response\", writes Patrick Lambe. \"Action\u2014''any'' action\u2014is the first and only way to respond appropriately.\"<ref>Lambe, Patrick (2007). ''Organising Knowledge: Taxonomies, Knowledge and Organisational Effectiveness''. Oxford: Chandos Publishing, 136.</ref> In this context, managers \"act\u2013sense\u2013respond\": ''act'' to establish order; ''sense'' where stability lies; ''respond'' to turn the chaotic into the complex.<ref name=SnowdenBoone2007/> Snowden and Boone write:\n\n<blockquote>In the chaotic domain, a leader\u2019s immediate job is not to discover patterns but to staunch the bleeding. A leader must first act to establish order, then sense where stability is present and from where it is absent, and then respond by working to transform the situation from chaos to complexity, where the identification of emerging patterns can both help prevent future crises and discern new opportunities. Communication of the most direct top-down or broadcast kind is imperative; there\u2019s simply no time to ask for input.<ref name=SnowdenBoone2007/></blockquote>\n\nThe [[September 11 attacks]] were an example of the ''chaotic'' category.<ref name=SnowdenBoone2007/> Stewart offers others: \"the firefighter whose gut makes him turn left or the trader who instinctively sells when the news about the stock seems too good to be true.\" One [[Crisis management|crisis executive]] said of the [[Enron scandal|collapse of Enron]]: \"People were afraid.&nbsp;... Decision-making was paralyzed.&nbsp;... You've got to be quick and decisive\u2014make little steps you know will succeed, so you can begin to tell a story that makes sense.\"<ref name=\"Stewart2002pp4-5\"/> \n\nSnowden and Boone give the example of the 1993 [[Brown's Chicken massacre]] in [[Palatine]], Illinois\u2014when robbers murdered seven employees in Brown's Chicken and Pasta restaurant\u2014as a situation in which local police faced all the domains. Deputy Police Chief Walt Gasior had to act immediately to stem the early panic (''chaotic''), while keeping the department running (''simple''), calling in experts (''complicated''), and maintaining community confidence in the following weeks (''complex'').<ref name=SnowdenBoone2007/>\n\n===Disorder / Confusion===\nThe dark ''disorder'' domain in the centre represents situations where there is no clarity about which of the other domains apply. By definition it is hard to see when this domain applies. \"Here, multiple perspectives jostle for prominence, factional leaders argue with one another, and cacophony rules\", write Snowden and Boone. \"The way out of this realm is to break down the situation into constituent parts and assign each to one of the other four realms. Leaders can then make decisions and intervene in contextually appropriate ways.\"<ref name=SnowdenBoone2007/>\n\n===Moving through domains===\nAs knowledge increases, there is a \"clockwise drift\" from ''chaotic'' through ''complex'' and ''complicated'' to ''simple''. Similarly, a \"buildup of biases\", complacency or lack of maintenance can cause a \"catastrophic failure\": a clockwise movement from ''simple'' to ''chaotic'', represented by the \"fold\" between those domains. There can be counter-clockwise movement as people die and knowledge is forgotten, or as new generations question the rules; and a counter-clockwise push from ''chaotic'' to ''simple'' can occur when a lack of order causes rules to be imposed suddenly.<ref name=KurtzSnowden2003/><ref name=SnowdenBoone2007/>\n\n== Applications and reception==\n[[File:Leader's Framework for Policing Protest.gif|thumb|upright=1.2|Using the Cynefin framework to analyse policing of the [[Occupy movement]] in the United States<ref name=Geron2014/>]]\nCynefin was used by its IBM developers in policy-making, product development, market creation, [[supply chain management]], [[Brand management|branding]] and [[customer relations]].<ref name=KurtzSnowden2003>{{cite journal|last1=Kurtz |first1=Cynthia F. |last2=Snowden |first2=David J. |title=The new dynamics of strategy: Sense-making in a complex and complicated world |journal=IBM Systems Journal |date=2003 |volume=42 |issue=3 |pages=462\u2013483 |doi=10.1147/sj.423.0462 |url=http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~brooks/storybiz/kurtz.pdf |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060918205828/http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~brooks/storybiz/kurtz.pdf |archivedate=18 September 2006 }}</ref> Later uses include analysing the impact of religion on policymaking within the [[George W.

According to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], the Aryan Brotherhood makes up an extremely low percentage of the entire US prison population but is responsible for a disproportionately large number of prison murders.\n\nThe gang has focused on the economic activities typical of organized crime entities, particularly drug trafficking, extortion, inmate prostitution, and murder-for-hire. Organization of its whites-only membership varies from prison to prison but is generally hierarchical, headed by a twelve-man council topped by a three-man commission. The Aryan Brotherhood uses various terms, symbols, and images to identify themselves, including shamrocks, swastikas, and other symbols. To join, members may swear a [[Blood brother|blood oath]] or take a pledge; acceptance into the Aryan Brotherhood is aided by a prospect's willingness to kill another inmate.\n\n==History==\n\nMost prisons in the United States were racially segregated until the 1960s. As prisons began to desegregate, many inmates organized along racial lines.<ref name = SPLC/> The Aryan Brotherhood is believed to have been formed at [[San Quentin State Prison]],<ref name=\"ABC\"/> but it may have been inspired by the [[Bluebird Gang]].<ref name = ABC/> They decided to strike against the blacks who were forming their own militant group called the [[Black Guerrilla Family]].<ref name=grann>David Grann.

Several members of the Manson Family were in prison at the time, and they attempted to join forces.

P. 255</ref>\n\nIn 1981, [[Thomas Silverstein]] and [[Clayton Fountain]] were charged with the murder of a black inmate named Robert Chappelle in the [[United States Penitentiary, Marion]], control unit. It was believed that Silverstein and Fountain strangled Chappelle in his cell. They later contacted Geri Riley to let her know it was done. Silverstein and Fountain later killed Raymond Smith, a friend of Robert Chappelle. The two men stabbed Smith 67 times. Silverstein then started to plan killing a correctional officer. On October 22, 1983, gang members from the Aryan Brotherhood killed two correction officers at Marion. Silverstein killed an officer named Merle Clutts, stabbing him approximately 40 times. Several hours later, Fountain also killed an officer named Robert Hoffman. The tactics used were developed for a prior inmate murder; Silverstein used an improvised knife and handcuff key while being taken to the showers. He picked the lock, then attacked and killed Merle Clutts. Fountain used similar tactics to kill Robert Hoffman.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/crime/2013/10/23/marion_prison_lockdown_thomas_silverstein_how_a_1983_murder_created_america.html|title = How a 1983 Murder Created America's Terrible Supermax-Prison Culture|publisher= Justin Peters| accessdate = February 14, 2015}}</ref>\n\nBy the 1990s, the Aryan Brotherhood had shifted its focus away from killing for strictly racial reasons and focused on organized crime such as drug trafficking, prostitution, and sanctioned murders.<ref name=grann/> They took on organized crime-level power inside of the prison system, and they hold more power than the [[Italian-American Mafia|Italian crime families]] within the prison system.<ref name=grann/> For example, [[Gambino crime family]] boss [[John Gotti]] was assaulted while incarcerated in Marion Federal Penitentiary in 1996, and he allegedly asked the Aryan Brotherhood to murder his attacker.

After some of its leaders were sent to federal prisons, they took the opportunity to start organizing inside the federal prison system. This ended with the creation of two separate, but related organizations, the California Aryan Brotherhood, and the federal prison Aryan Brotherhood. As a former top leader said, \"They\u2019re like two related but different crime families. They each have their [ruling] commission\u2026 but they\u2019re allies.\"  By the late 1970s, these gangs had fewer than 100 members, but their membership grew rapidly as they absorbed other racist and skinhead groups, and today these gangs are estimated to have over 20,000 members in both the federal and state prison systems.<ref name=splc-groupdef />\n\nIn its early days, the group had a one-man, one-vote system, but this broke down as a result of the group's rapid expansion, and it  was replaced by the establishment of a hierarchical structure, headed by a 12-man council, and overseen by a three-member commission. The federal and state systems each had their own council and commission.<ref name=splc-groupdef /> Organization varies somewhat, from prison to prison. For example, in the Arizona prison system, members are known as \"kindred\" and organize into \"families.\" A \"council\" controls the families. Kindred may recruit other members, known as \"progeny,\" and serve as a mentor for the new recruits.<ref name=AZDOC>Arizona Department of Corrections.

According to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], the Aryan Brotherhood makes up an extremely low percentage of the entire US prison population but is responsible for a disproportionately large number of prison murders.\n\nThe gang has focused on the economic activities typical of organized crime entities, particularly drug trafficking, extortion, inmate prostitution, and murder-for-hire. Organization of its whites-only membership varies from prison to prison but is generally hierarchical, headed by a twelve-man council topped by a three-man commission. The Aryan Brotherhood uses various terms, symbols, and images to identify themselves, including shamrocks, swastikas, and other symbols. To join, members may swear a [[Blood brother|blood oath]] or take a pledge; acceptance into the Aryan Brotherhood is aided by a prospect's willingness to kill another inmate.\n\n==History==\n\nMost prisons in the United States were racially segregated until the 1960s. As prisons began to desegregate, many inmates organized along racial lines.<ref name = SPLC/> The Aryan Brotherhood is believed to have been formed at [[San Quentin State Prison]],<ref name=\"ABC\"/> but it may have been inspired by the [[Bluebird Gang]].<ref name = ABC/> They decided to strike against the blacks who were forming their own militant group called the [[Black Guerrilla Family]].<ref name=grann>David Grann.

It was believed that Silverstein and Fountain strangled Chappelle in his cell. They later contacted Geri Riley to let her know it was done. Silverstein and Fountain later killed Raymond Smith, a friend of Robert Chappelle. The two men stabbed Smith 67 times. Silverstein then started to plan killing a correctional officer. On October 22, 1983, gang members from the Aryan Brotherhood killed two correction officers at Marion. Silverstein killed an officer named Merle Clutts, stabbing him approximately 40 times. Several hours later, Fountain also killed an officer named Robert Hoffman. The tactics used were developed for a prior inmate murder; Silverstein used an improvised knife and handcuff key while being taken to the showers. He picked the lock, then attacked and killed Merle Clutts. Fountain used similar tactics to kill Robert Hoffman.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/crime/2013/10/23/marion_prison_lockdown_thomas_silverstein_how_a_1983_murder_created_america.html|title = How a 1983 Murder Created America's Terrible Supermax-Prison Culture|publisher= Justin Peters| accessdate = February 14, 2015}}</ref>\n\nBy the 1990s, the Aryan Brotherhood had shifted its focus away from killing for strictly racial reasons and focused on organized crime such as drug trafficking, prostitution, and sanctioned murders.<ref name=grann/> They took on organized crime-level power inside of the prison system, and they hold more power than the [[Italian-American Mafia|Italian crime families]] within the prison system.<ref name=grann/> For example, [[Gambino crime family]] boss [[John Gotti]] was assaulted while incarcerated in Marion Federal Penitentiary in 1996, and he allegedly asked the Aryan Brotherhood to murder his attacker.

After some of its leaders were sent to federal prisons, they took the opportunity to start organizing inside the federal prison system. This ended with the creation of two separate, but related organizations, the California Aryan Brotherhood, and the federal prison Aryan Brotherhood. As a former top leader said, \"They\u2019re like two related but different crime families. They each have their [ruling] commission\u2026 but they\u2019re allies.\"  By the late 1970s, these gangs had fewer than 100 members, but their membership grew rapidly as they absorbed other racist and skinhead groups, and today these gangs are estimated to have over 20,000 members in both the federal and state prison systems.<ref name=splc-groupdef />\n\nIn its early days, the group had a one-man, one-vote system, but this broke down as a result of the group's rapid expansion, and it  was replaced by the establishment of a hierarchical structure, headed by a 12-man council, and overseen by a three-member commission. The federal and state systems each had their own council and commission.<ref name=splc-groupdef /> Organization varies somewhat, from prison to prison. For example, in the Arizona prison system, members are known as \"kindred\" and organize into \"families.\" A \"council\" controls the families.

Around the age of 13, he moved to [[Iraq]] and took up residence in the holy city of [[Najaf]] where he began studying Shia theology with the scholars of that city.  He eventually attained the rank of Ayatollah and was subsequently made a [[Marja'|marja]].  Khoei would continue to live in Najaf, becoming a teacher for the remainder of his life, and overseeing the studies of scholars who would be qualified to issue fatwas based on Shia theology.\n\nDue to his prominent position as a teacher and scholar in Najaf, he became an important leader of worldwide Shias.  He was made the most prominent Grand Ayatollah in 1971 after the death of [[Muhsin al-Hakim]].  In this position, he became a patron of numerous institutions across the globe that sought to provide welfare, and also provided scholarships to theological students from across the Muslim world.\n\nHe is considered as the architect of a distinct school of thought in the principles of jurisprudence and Islamic law, and one of the leading exponents of 'kalam'-scholastic theology- and 'rijal'- study of the biographies of transmitters of ahadith, the prophetic traditions, 'fiqh'- jurisprudence- and 'tafseer'- exegesis of the Qur'an. His interests included astronomy, mathematics, and philosophy.\n\nAl-Khoei's status as the pre-eminent scholar of his age did not go unchallenged. In the 1970s, Grand Ayatollah [[Mohammad al-Husayni al-Shirazi|Mohammed Al-Shirazi]], a radical theologian based in [[Karbala]] had a long running feud with Al Khoei and his fellow clerics in Najaf over the legitimacy of theocratic rule. The dispute resulted in Al-Khoei seeking to dismiss Al Shirazi's status as a religious scholar.<ref>[http://www.aei.org/outlook/foreign-and-defense-policy/regional/middle-east-and-north-africa/has-kuwait-reached-the-sectarian-tipping-point/ Has Kuwait reached the sectarian tipping point?], [[American Enterprise Institute]], August 14, 2013</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]], Khoei was arrested by [[Saddam Hussein]] during the mass Shia uprising that followed the defeat of Iraqi forces.  While under arrest, he was taken to [[Baghdad]] and forced to make public appearances with Saddam Hussein.  Hussein eventually allowed Khoei to return to Najaf, but he was placed under house arrest. Khoei died on 8 August 1992 in [[Najaf]] at the age of 92.<ref>[https://www.al-khoei.org/about-2/the-foundation-2/ Biography of Ayatollah Khoei in English]</ref> His funeral was led by his student [[Ali al-Sistani]].

Around the age of 13, he moved to [[Iraq]] and took up residence in the holy city of [[Najaf]] where he began studying Shia theology with the scholars of that city.  He eventually attained the rank of Ayatollah and was subsequently made a [[Marja'|marja]].  Khoei would continue to live in Najaf, becoming a teacher for the remainder of his life, and overseeing the studies of scholars who would be qualified to issue fatwas based on Shia theology.\n\nDue to his prominent position as a teacher and scholar in Najaf, he became an important leader of worldwide Shias.  He was made the most prominent Grand Ayatollah in 1971 after the death of [[Muhsin al-Hakim]].  In this position, he became a patron of numerous institutions across the globe that sought to provide welfare, and also provided scholarships to theological students from across the Muslim world.\n\nHe is considered as the architect of a distinct school of thought in the principles of jurisprudence and Islamic law, and one of the leading exponents of 'kalam'-scholastic theology- and 'rijal'- study of the biographies of transmitters of ahadith, the prophetic traditions, 'fiqh'- jurisprudence- and 'tafseer'- exegesis of the Qur'an. His interests included astronomy, mathematics, and philosophy.\n\nAl-Khoei's status as the pre-eminent scholar of his age did not go unchallenged. In the 1970s, Grand Ayatollah [[Mohammad al-Husayni al-Shirazi|Mohammed Al-Shirazi]], a radical theologian based in [[Karbala]] had a long running feud with Al Khoei and his fellow clerics in Najaf over the legitimacy of theocratic rule. The dispute resulted in Al-Khoei seeking to dismiss Al Shirazi's status as a religious scholar.<ref>[http://www.aei.org/outlook/foreign-and-defense-policy/regional/middle-east-and-north-africa/has-kuwait-reached-the-sectarian-tipping-point/ Has Kuwait reached the sectarian tipping point?], [[American Enterprise Institute]], August 14, 2013</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]], Khoei was arrested by [[Saddam Hussein]] during the mass Shia uprising that followed the defeat of Iraqi forces.  While under arrest, he was taken to [[Baghdad]] and forced to make public appearances with Saddam Hussein.  Hussein eventually allowed Khoei to return to Najaf, but he was placed under house arrest. Khoei died on 8 August 1992 in [[Najaf]] at the age of 92.<ref>[https://www.al-khoei.org/about-2/the-foundation-2/ Biography of Ayatollah Khoei in English]</ref> His funeral was led by his student [[Ali al-Sistani]].

The five remaining episodes that had been unaired finally did air on [[Adult Swim]] in 2002. A second season consisting of thirteen episodes was produced but never aired.\n\nThe animated adaptation of ''Baby Blues'' differs from the comic by having it take place when Zoe was still an infant, even though she was the older sister to Hammie in the strip at the time. In addition, it focuses on Darryl and Wanda's relationship with supporting characters created for this series, including the Bittermans (a dysfunctional next-door family with three children), Bizzy (Zoe's babysitter), and Kenny (Darryl's laid-back close friend and co-worker).\n\nThe theme song of the series is \"[[It's All Been Done]]\" by [[Barenaked Ladies]].\n\n==Production==\n[[Warner Bros. Animation]] produced eight of the 13 aired episodes, with overseas animation done by [[Varga Studio]] in Hungary for five of them (including the pilot), and [[Sunwoo Entertainment]] in Korea for the three others. [[Rough Draft Studios]] in [[Los Angeles]] did five episodes, which include \"Bizzy Moves In\", \"Rodney Has Two Daddies\", \"Hurtin' Inside\", \"Ugly Zoe\", and \"Wanda Moves Up\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/baby-blues/god-forbid-101175/trivia/|title=Baby Blues: God Forbid|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=TV.com|accessdate=3 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140423051634/http://www.tv.com/shows/baby-blues/god-forbid-101175/trivia/|archive-date=23 April 2014|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.awn.com/news/rough-draft-produce-baby-blues-fueling-rumor-warner-layoffs|title=Rough Draft to produce \"Baby Blues\", fueling rumor of Warner layoffs|work=Animation World Network|accessdate=3 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150504021836/http://www.awn.com/news/rough-draft-produce-baby-blues-fueling-rumor-warner-layoffs|archive-date=4 May 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn another attempt to compete with [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]'s [[Fox cartoons|popular animated sitcoms]], The WB made the series to be more [[Adult animation|adult-oriented]] than the comic strip (by having some sexuality, mild swearing, etc.). Because Rick Kirkman and Jerry Scott had limited creative control over the animated version, they were not completely pleased about this kind of difference, though Scott said he liked \"part of it\".<ref name=\"enquirer.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.enquirer.com/columns/kiese/2000/07/27/jki_kiesewetter_network.html|title=Network puts too much blue in 'Baby Blues'|work=enquirer.com|accessdate=3 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190710165725/https://www.cincinnati.com/|archive-date=10 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Baby Blues'' animated series took nearly five years to develop and produce,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kingfeatures.com/2000/07/baby-blues-celebrates-10-years/|title=Baby Blues Celebrates 10 Years!|work=kingfeatures.com|accessdate=3 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150914181509/http://kingfeatures.com/2000/07/baby-blues-celebrates-10-years/|archive-date=14 September 2015|url-status=live|date=2000-07-11}}</ref> and what was initially the pilot, \"A Baby Blues Christmas Special\" was supposed to air in December 1998, but it was postponed more than once,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/baby-blues/a-baby-blues-christmas-special-a-k-a-the-christmas-101636/trivia/|title=Baby Blues: A Baby Blues Christmas Special (a.k.a.

He tends to think Wanda's heart-felt ideas are crazy, but will later agree with them if there is an advantage for himself.  He wants the best for his baby daughter, but can overly protect her.  Despite intending to do the right thing, he has done unexpected selfish things, such as pretending to grieve over going with Carl and their kids to a fun zone, only to watch an attractive dancer at the place singing every time it was a child's birthday. But in the end, he is faithful to his wife and daughter. Darryl often feels that his wife nags him and will always discuss his issues to his friend, Kenny at work. Most commonly, he will talk about a problem, the next day, talk about how happy he is to have solved the problem an easy way, then the next day, talk about how it did not work out.  Darryl is quick to express jealousy\u2014particularly of Carl, his next door neighbor.\n* Wanda MacPherson ([[Julia Sweeney]]) \u2013 Wanda is Darryl's wife and Zoe's mother. She is caring, unpredictable, passionate and impulsive by turns. However, just as Darryl does, she loves Zoe and wants only the best for her. Wanda is a stay at home mom. Her closest friends are her neighbor Melinda and a teenage girl named Bizzy, who serves as Zoe's babysitter from time to time. Wanda generally has a cheerful disposition, but she is quick to let her emotions get the best of her. She will usually go through drastic measures to fix something, against her husband's wishes. Wanda is occasionally melancholy about motherhood, as suggested by the title ''Baby Blues''. She is said to have a \"crazy spark\" in her that never left. This is seen at one point, when she wants to feel young again and escapes with Bizzy and her friends at night and gets caught by the police. Wanda's unpredictable and impulsive behavior is often a source of extreme stress for Darryl. However, in the end, they always settle their differences and make peace after the arguments and problems are resolved.\n* Zoe MacPherson ([[E.G. Daily]]) \u2013 Zoe is the infant daughter of Darryl and Wanda. As a baby, Zoe's curiosity and emotions are expressed in her eyes, which show almost complete understanding when something happens or if somebody talks to her. Although calm and cheerful in the day time, she is very loud and cries nonstop at night, leaving her parents to stay up all night, taking turns rocking her, and carrying her until day time. Zoe appears to have a really close relationship with Rodney, the trouble kid next door who seems to be the only one who could stop her crying and comfort her.\n* Melinda Bitterman ([[Arabella Field]]) \u2013 Melinda is Wanda's friend and neighbor whose family is dysfunctional. Melinda is always seen smoking in her yard as her husband and kids are working on some bizarre, dangerous or disastrous activity. Any time she sees Wanda, she always greets with the same line, \"Hi Wanda, how's the baby?\" Seemingly careless or tired, Melinda seems to desire the happiness and relationship she once had before she became a mother and somewhat envies Wanda's stable life, but is still content with her family. She always talks in a calm voice, even when discussing an insane thing that her family is doing, as if it were normal.\n* Carl Bitterman ([[Joel Murray]]) \u2013 Melinda's husky, big-muscled and overweight husband. A seemingly bum like man, Carl claims that he gives his kids strict discipline, even though he has lowered himself to their level many times, particularly Rodney, who pesters Carl until he takes aggressive action. Carl is usually envied by Darryl, for his mechanic skills and other things Darryl fails at. Carl can be rude and obnoxious at times, but considers himself the \"man of the house\". He usually involves his children in several activities, such as practicing to shoot arrows or riding in a hover car without seat belts. He belittles Darryl's parenting skills, and self-confidence, either bluntly or through his children who have little respect for Darryl. Because of this, Carl and Darryl do not particularly get along, although Darryl has been talked into doing things he would not normally do, because of Carl's forceful insistence.\n* Rodney Bitterman ([[Kath Soucie]]) \u2013 Rodney is the eight-year-old son of Carl and Melinda Bitterman. Rodney is also the antagonist. Rodney is very mischievous and is best known for causing a lot of trouble. However, he's the smartest of his siblings and is street wise. Rodney repeatedly pesters his dad by asking stupid questions, shooting knock-knock jokes to avoid going to bed, and placing his finger an inch from his father's tools immediately after being told not to touch them. Rodney's antics always makes his sister, Megan, laugh.  Besides being a menace, he can be very sympathetic, particularly to Darryl and Zoe. The sensitive side of Rodney has shown his somewhat neglected or misunderstood relationship with his dad. At one time, Rodney had tried one of Darryl's cheesy mushrooms and realized how much he cared about good food and wanted to cook. However, his father thought it was silly, so Rodney had relied on Darryl to help him.  This preference to Darryl over his own dad led Darryl to pride, despite Rodney's annoying and teasing Darryl many times previously. Rodney's sensitive side also shows through his a caring and loving relationship with Zoe.\n* Megan Bitterman (Kath Soucie)  \u2013 Megan is Rodney's younger sister and is very close to Rodney. Megan is most commonly known for laughing out loud at anything Rodney does to pester their father. Megan is almost always seen with Rodney and keeps a huge smile on her face all the time. However, when Rodney is not around, she is seen to get very sad and cry.\n* Shelby Bitterman \u2013 Carl and Melinda's youngest son who is a [[Psychopathy|sociopath]] and is always seen carrying a fat, green, baseball bat around which he hits things with, without expression. The episode \"Hurtin Inside\" revealed he is four years old. He never speaks, but often communicates by pointing, and was once seen to whisper to his mom at a game of baseball in \"The Bitterman Hillbillies\".\n* Bizzy Carey ([[Nicole Sullivan]]) \u2013 Darryl and Wanda's teenage friend who babysits Zoe on many occasions. The MacPhersons have known her since she was a girl scout. Bizzy seems to look older than she actually is, since Darryl's boss once bought Darryl's lie about her being his wife.  She dislikes [[Drew Carey]], her faux morally responsible stepfather. Wanda and Darryl many times have had to question her about her many dysfunctional boyfriends.  Bizzy is blond, very thin and has a fast metabolism, as she once claimed when Wanda discovered Bizzy had been sitting on the couch all day, eating a whole bag of chocolate chip cookies, with no worry, while babysitting. It is unknown if Bizzy is her real name or not.\n* Kenny ([[Diedrich Bader]]) \u2013 Kenny is Darryl's smooth-talking friend and co-worker at the office.  Kenny is something of a nuisance to Darryl, such as bragging about his life and family, or poking fun at Darryl's personal relationship with Wanda. Darryl normally talks to Kenny about his problems at home, to which Kenny advises with either agreeable or nonagreeable mischievous ideas. Kenny's personality is seen to be laid back and worry-free, however, he grew upset and anxious one time Darryl stopped working for a while.  Even though Kenny seems to think his family's normal, it's hinted that his wife was cheating on him with a neighbor, and that he might be a neglectful father, since for one second in an episode he forgot he had a third child.\n* Charlie ([[Phil LaMarr]]) \u2013 The MacPhersons' pet dog.\n\n=== Recurring and minor ===\n* Rex (Phil LaMarr) and Josie ([[Wendy Raquel Robinson]]) \u2013 An African-American couple who are close friends of Darryl and Wanda's. Rex is known for appearing in sweaters similar to what [[Bill Cosby]] wore on ''[[The Cosby Show]]'', while Josie's favorite pastime is gardening. In the episode \"God Forbid\", they admit that they are [[Moonies]].\n* Sylvia (Kath Soucie) and Midge (E.G. Daily) \u2013 A lesbian couple who are close friends of Darryl and Wanda's. Sylvia has black hair, while Midge is blonde.\n* Mrs. Johnson ([[Alice Hirson]]) \u2013 An elderly lady, and another one of Darryl and Wanda's neighbors. She has an [[Unseen character|unseen]] son named Howard, a \"[[Puer aeternus|man-child]]\" who still loves to read comics in his treehouse.\n* Officer Murphy (Diedrich Bader) \u2013 An obese police officer who speaks with a stereotypical Irish accent.\n* Dr. Gruber ([[Steven Weber (actor)|Steven Weber]]) \u2013 The MacPhersons' big-nosed, big-eared family doctor who likes to make jokes. He appeared in two episodes straight, \"Ugly Zoe\" and \"Wanda Proof\".\n* Hugh ([[Jim Cummings]]) and Maggie Wizowski (Julia Sweeney) \u2013 Wanda's parents who appeared in two episodes, \"Rodney Moves In\" and \"A Baby Blues Christmas Special\", along with Darryl's parents. Darryl criticized his father-in-law for telling lousy stories.\n* Pauline (Arabella Field) and \"Mac\" MacPherson \u2013 Darryl's mother and silent father.\n* Bunny (Kath Soucie) \u2013 A close friend of Wanda's, and the only character from the comic strip, besides the MacPherson/Wizowski family, to appear in this series. However, unlike in the strip, where she has a son named Bogart, she has a baby boy with long blond hair named Haget. Butch, her husband from the original comic strip, never appears in the series.\n\n==Episodes==\n\n{{Episode table\n|background=#ffeb87\n|overall= 5\n|title=\n|director=\n|writer=25\n|airdate=\n|prodcode =\n|country=US\n|episodes=\n\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber = 1\n|Title = God Forbid\n|DirectedBy = Shawn Bj\u00f6rklund\n|WrittenBy = Robert Kurtz & Eric Brand\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2000|7|28}}\n| ProdCode = 225-047\n|ShortSummary = Darryl and Wanda reluctantly recruit their colorful next door neighbors, the Bittermans, to be the caretakers of Zoe should something happen to them.\n| LineColor = ffeb87\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber = 2\n|Title = Bizzy Moves In\n|DirectedBy = [[Rich Moore]]\n|WrittenBy = [[Jill Soloway]]\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2000|7|28}}\n| ProdCode = 225-048\n|ShortSummary = Wanda, going through a [[mid-life crisis]], starts hanging out with Bizzy (Zoe's babysitter).

The series also received mixed to negative reviews from professional critics. Particularly, on its premiere night, [[South Coast Today]] wrote that \"'Baby Blues' is hardly perfect. Its teen characters are right out of the [[MTV]]/WB playbook; the notion of a nutty family next door is as old as the sitcom hills. But as a slightly silly, slightly sweet summer series that's not afraid to show it has a heart, it more than exceeds even this cranky critic's expectations.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southcoasttoday.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20000728/NEWS/307289910|title=WB's 'Baby Blues' exceeds critic's (low) expectations|work=southcoasttoday.com|accessdate=3 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924104511/http://www.southcoasttoday.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20000728%2FNEWS%2F307289910|archive-date=24 September 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> David Bianculli of [[New York Daily News]] was negative towards ''Baby Blues'', giving it 1 1/2 stars, and called it \"depressingly flat\". Also in the article, he wrote \"Timing and originality, even in comedy, may not be everything \u2013 but they count for a lot, and WB's new 'Baby Blues' series doesn't get high marks in either category. First, 'Baby Blues', which premieres with a double header tonight at 8, is an animated prime-time comedy, arriving the summer after a season in which there were too many dull entries in that particular genre. That's bad timing. 'Baby Blues' could overcome that by being funnier than the rest. Unfortunately, it's not. Second, 'Baby Blues', based on the syndicated comic strip by Rick Kirkman and Jerry Scott, is a sitcom in two dimensions. That is, it's an animated show in which human beings engage in everyday activities \u2013 working, goofing off, sleeping, fighting and so on. At its best, this particular category of animated comedy gives you '[[The Simpsons]]'. At its worst, it gives you '[[Clerks: The Animated Series|Clerks]]'.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/baby-blues-cries-originality-article-1.893527|title='BABY BLUES' CRIES OUT FOR ORIGINALITY|publisher=|access-date=2014-04-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140420002212/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/baby-blues-cries-originality-article-1.893527|archive-date=2014-04-20|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nJohn Kiesewetter from the [[Television Critics Association]] wrote a negative article on the series.

The five remaining episodes that had been unaired finally did air on [[Adult Swim]] in 2002. A second season consisting of thirteen episodes was produced but never aired.\n\nThe animated adaptation of ''Baby Blues'' differs from the comic by having it take place when Zoe was still an infant, even though she was the older sister to Hammie in the strip at the time. In addition, it focuses on Darryl and Wanda's relationship with supporting characters created for this series, including the Bittermans (a dysfunctional next-door family with three children), Bizzy (Zoe's babysitter), and Kenny (Darryl's laid-back close friend and co-worker).\n\nThe theme song of the show is \"[[It's All Been Done]]\" by [[Barenaked Ladies]].\n\n==Production==\n[[Warner Bros. Animation]] produced eight of the 13 aired episodes, with overseas animation done by [[Varga Studio]] in Hungary for five of them (including the pilot), and [[Sunwoo Entertainment]] in Korea for the three others. [[Rough Draft Studios]] in [[Los Angeles]] did five episodes, which include \"Bizzy Moves In\", \"Rodney Has Two Daddies\", \"Hurtin' Inside\", \"Ugly Zoe\", and \"Wanda Moves Up\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/baby-blues/god-forbid-101175/trivia/|title=Baby Blues: God Forbid|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=TV.com|accessdate=3 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140423051634/http://www.tv.com/shows/baby-blues/god-forbid-101175/trivia/|archive-date=23 April 2014|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.awn.com/news/rough-draft-produce-baby-blues-fueling-rumor-warner-layoffs|title=Rough Draft to produce \"Baby Blues\", fueling rumor of Warner layoffs|work=Animation World Network|accessdate=3 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150504021836/http://www.awn.com/news/rough-draft-produce-baby-blues-fueling-rumor-warner-layoffs|archive-date=4 May 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn another attempt to compete with [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]'s [[Fox cartoons|popular animated sitcoms]], The WB made the show to be more [[Adult animation|adult-oriented]] than the comic strip (by having some sexuality, mild swearing, etc.).

He tends to think Wanda's heart-felt ideas are crazy, but will later agree with them if there is an advantage for himself.  He wants the best for his baby daughter, but can overly protect her.  Despite intending to do the right thing, he has done unexpected selfish things, such as pretending to grieve over going with Carl and their kids to a fun zone, only to watch an attractive dancer at the place singing every time it was a child's birthday. But in the end, he is faithful to his wife and daughter. Darryl often feels that his wife nags him and will always discuss his issues to his friend, Kenny at work. Most commonly, he will talk about a problem, the next day, talk about how happy he is to have solved the problem an easy way, then the next day, talk about how it did not work out.  Darryl is quick to express jealousy\u2014particularly of Carl, his next door neighbor.\n* Wanda MacPherson ([[Julia Sweeney]]) \u2013 Wanda is Darryl's wife and Zoe's mother. She is caring, unpredictable, passionate and impulsive by turns. However, just as Darryl does, she loves Zoe and wants only the best for her. Wanda is a stay at home mom. Her closest friends are her neighbor Melinda and a teenage girl named Bizzy, who serves as Zoe's babysitter from time to time. Wanda generally has a cheerful disposition, but she is quick to let her emotions get the best of her. She will usually go through drastic measures to fix something, against her husband's wishes. Wanda is occasionally melancholy about motherhood, as suggested by the title ''Baby Blues''. She is said to have a \"crazy spark\" in her that never left. This is seen at one point, when she wants to feel young again and escapes with Bizzy and her friends at night and gets caught by the police. Wanda's unpredictable and impulsive behavior is often a source of extreme stress for Darryl. However, in the end, they always settle their differences and make peace after the arguments and problems are resolved.\n* Zoe MacPherson ([[E.G. Daily]]) \u2013 Zoe is the infant daughter of Darryl and Wanda. As a baby, Zoe's curiosity and emotions are expressed in her eyes, which show almost complete understanding when something happens or if somebody talks to her. Although calm and cheerful in the day time, she is very loud and cries nonstop at night, leaving her parents to stay up all night, taking turns rocking her, and carrying her until day time. Zoe appears to have a really close relationship with Rodney, the trouble kid next door who seems to be the only one who could stop her crying and comfort her.\n* Melinda Bitterman ([[Arabella Field]]) \u2013 Melinda is Wanda's friend and neighbor whose family is dysfunctional. Melinda is always seen smoking in her yard as her husband and kids are working on some bizarre, dangerous or disastrous activity. Any time she sees Wanda, she always greets with the same line, \"Hi Wanda, how's the baby?\" Seemingly careless or tired, Melinda seems to desire the happiness and relationship she once had before she became a mother and somewhat envies Wanda's stable life, but is still content with her family. She always talks in a calm voice, even when discussing an insane thing that her family is doing, as if it were normal.\n* Carl Bitterman ([[Joel Murray]]) \u2013 Melinda's husky, big-muscled and overweight husband. A seemingly bum like man, Carl claims that he gives his kids strict discipline, even though he has lowered himself to their level many times, particularly Rodney, who pesters Carl until he takes aggressive action. Carl is usually envied by Darryl, for his mechanic skills and other things Darryl fails at. Carl can be rude and obnoxious at times, but considers himself the \"man of the house\". He usually involves his children in several activities, such as practicing to shoot arrows or riding in a hover car without seat belts. He belittles Darryl's parenting skills, and self-confidence, either bluntly or through his children who have little respect for Darryl. Because of this, Carl and Darryl do not particularly get along, although Darryl has been talked into doing things he would not normally do, because of Carl's forceful insistence.\n* Rodney Bitterman ([[Kath Soucie]]) \u2013 Rodney is the eight-year-old son of Carl and Melinda Bitterman. Rodney is also the antagonist. Rodney is very mischievous and is best known for causing a lot of trouble. However, he's the smartest of his siblings and is street wise. Rodney repeatedly pesters his dad by asking stupid questions, shooting knock-knock jokes to avoid going to bed, and placing his finger an inch from his father's tools immediately after being told not to touch them. Rodney's antics always makes his sister, Megan, laugh.  Besides being a menace, he can be very sympathetic, particularly to Darryl and Zoe. The sensitive side of Rodney has shown his somewhat neglected or misunderstood relationship with his dad. At one time, Rodney had tried one of Darryl's cheesy mushrooms and realized how much he cared about good food and wanted to cook. However, his father thought it was silly, so Rodney had relied on Darryl to help him.  This preference to Darryl over his own dad led Darryl to pride, despite Rodney's annoying and teasing Darryl many times previously. Rodney's sensitive side also shows through his a caring and loving relationship with Zoe.\n* Megan Bitterman (Kath Soucie)  \u2013 Megan is Rodney's younger sister and is very close to Rodney. Megan is most commonly known for laughing out loud at anything Rodney does to pester their father. Megan is almost always seen with Rodney and keeps a huge smile on her face all the time. However, when Rodney is not around, she is seen to get very sad and cry.\n* Shelby Bitterman \u2013 Carl and Melinda's youngest son who is a [[Psychopathy|sociopath]] and is always seen carrying a fat, green, baseball bat around which he hits things with, without expression. The episode \"Hurtin Inside\" revealed he is four years old. He never speaks, but often communicates by pointing, and was once seen to whisper to his mom at a game of baseball in \"The Bitterman Hillbillies\".\n* Bizzy Carey ([[Nicole Sullivan]]) \u2013 Darryl and Wanda's teenage friend who babysits Zoe on many occasions. The MacPhersons have known her since she was a girl scout. Bizzy seems to look older than she actually is, since Darryl's boss once bought Darryl's lie about her being his wife.  She dislikes [[Drew Carey]], her faux morally responsible stepfather. Wanda and Darryl many times have had to question her about her many dysfunctional boyfriends.  Bizzy is blond, very thin and has a fast metabolism, as she once claimed when Wanda discovered Bizzy had been sitting on the couch all day, eating a whole bag of chocolate chip cookies, with no worry, while babysitting. It is unknown if Bizzy is her real name or not.\n* Kenny ([[Diedrich Bader]]) \u2013 Kenny is Darryl's smooth-talking friend and co-worker at the office.  Kenny is something of a nuisance to Darryl, such as bragging about his life and family, or poking fun at Darryl's personal relationship with Wanda. Darryl normally talks to Kenny about his problems at home, to which Kenny advises with either agreeable or nonagreeable mischievous ideas. Kenny's personality is seen to be laid back and worry-free, however, he grew upset and anxious one time Darryl stopped working for a while.  Even though Kenny seems to think his family's normal, it's hinted that his wife was cheating on him with a neighbor, and that he might be a neglectful father, since for one second in an episode he forgot he had a third child.\n* Charlie ([[Phil LaMarr]]) \u2013 The MacPhersons' pet dog.\n\n=== Recurring and minor ===\n* Rex (Phil LaMarr) and Josie ([[Wendy Raquel Robinson]]) \u2013 An African-American couple who are close friends of Darryl and Wanda's. Rex is known for appearing in sweaters similar to what [[Bill Cosby]] wore on ''[[The Cosby Show]]'', while Josie's favorite pastime is gardening. In the episode \"God Forbid\", they admit that they are [[Moonies]].\n* Sylvia (Kath Soucie) and Midge (E.G. Daily) \u2013 A lesbian couple who are close friends of Darryl and Wanda's. Sylvia has black hair, while Midge is blonde.\n* Mrs. Johnson ([[Alice Hirson]]) \u2013 An elderly lady, and another one of Darryl and Wanda's neighbors. She has an [[Unseen character|unseen]] son named Howard, a \"[[Puer aeternus|man-child]]\" who still loves to read comics in his treehouse.\n* Officer Murphy (Diedrich Bader) \u2013 An obese police officer who speaks with a stereotypical Irish accent.\n* Dr. Gruber ([[Steven Weber (actor)|Steven Weber]]) \u2013 The MacPhersons' big-nosed, big-eared family doctor who likes to make jokes. He appeared in two episodes straight, \"Ugly Zoe\" and \"Wanda Proof\".\n* Hugh ([[Jim Cummings]]) and Maggie Wizowski (Julia Sweeney) \u2013 Wanda's parents who appeared in two episodes, \"Rodney Moves In\" and \"A Baby Blues Christmas Special\", along with Darryl's parents.

The series also received mixed to negative reviews from professional critics. Particularly, on its premiere night, [[South Coast Today]] wrote that \"'Baby Blues' is hardly perfect. Its teen characters are right out of the [[MTV]]/WB playbook; the notion of a nutty family next door is as old as the sitcom hills. But as a slightly silly, slightly sweet summer series that's not afraid to show it has a heart, it more than exceeds even this cranky critic's expectations.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southcoasttoday.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20000728/NEWS/307289910|title=WB's 'Baby Blues' exceeds critic's (low) expectations|work=southcoasttoday.com|accessdate=3 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924104511/http://www.southcoasttoday.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20000728%2FNEWS%2F307289910|archive-date=24 September 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> David Bianculli of [[New York Daily News]] was negative towards ''Baby Blues'', giving it 1 1/2 stars, and called it \"depressingly flat\". Also in the article, he wrote \"Timing and originality, even in comedy, may not be everything \u2013 but they count for a lot, and WB's new 'Baby Blues' series doesn't get high marks in either category. First, 'Baby Blues', which premieres with a double header tonight at 8, is an animated prime-time comedy, arriving the summer after a season in which there were too many dull entries in that particular genre. That's bad timing. 'Baby Blues' could overcome that by being funnier than the rest. Unfortunately, it's not. Second, 'Baby Blues', based on the syndicated comic strip by Rick Kirkman and Jerry Scott, is a sitcom in two dimensions. That is, it's an animated show in which human beings engage in everyday activities \u2013 working, goofing off, sleeping, fighting and so on. At its best, this particular category of animated comedy gives you '[[The Simpsons]]'. At its worst, it gives you '[[Clerks: The Animated Series|Clerks]]'.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/baby-blues-cries-originality-article-1.893527|title='BABY BLUES' CRIES OUT FOR ORIGINALITY|publisher=|access-date=2014-04-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140420002212/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/baby-blues-cries-originality-article-1.893527|archive-date=2014-04-20|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nJohn Kiesewetter from the [[Television Critics Association]] wrote a negative article on the show.
