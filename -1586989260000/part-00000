This is a [[double entendre]], referring both to the school's date of founding and its academic stature. Boston Latin has a history of pursuing the same standards as elite [[New England]] [[University-preparatory school|prep schools]] while adopting the egalitarian attitude of a [[Public school (government funded)|public school]]. Academically, the school regularly outperforms public schools in affluent Boston suburbs, particularly as measured by the yearly [[Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System|MCAS]] assessment required of all [[Massachusetts]] [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]]. In 2006, [[Brooklyn Latin School]] was founded in New York City, explicitly modeled on Boston Latin, borrowing much from its traditions and curriculum.<ref>{{cite news|first=Tracy|last=Jan|title=Growing a Boston Latin in Brooklyn|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2006/03/04/growing_a_boston_latin_in_brooklyn/|work=Boston Globe|date=March 4, 2006|accessdate=2007-08-31}}</ref>\n\n===Admissions===\nAdmission is determined by a combination of a student's score on the [[Independent School Entrance Examination]] (ISEE) and recent grades, and is limited to residents of the city of Boston.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bls.org/doc_content/ISEE%20QUESTIONS.pdf |title=Answers to Frequently Asked Questions about Entrance to Boston Latin School |accessdate=2007-12-31 |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229063010/http://www.bls.org/doc_content/ISEE%20QUESTIONS.pdf |archivedate=2008-02-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Although Boston Latin runs from the 7th through the 12th grade, it admits students only into the 7th and 9th grades.\n\nBecause it is a high-performing and well-regarded school, Boston Latin has been at the center of controversy concerning its admissions process. Admissions are very competitive, and it is not uncommon for fewer than 20% of applicants to be admitted. Before the 1997 school year, Boston Latin set aside a 35% [[Racial quota|quota]] of places in its incoming class for under-represented minorities. The school was forced to drop this policy after a series of lawsuits involving non-minority girls who were not admitted despite ranking higher than admitted minorities.<ref>See: Wessmann v. Gittens, 160 F. 3d 790 \u2013 Court of Appeals, 1st Circuit 1998 [[s:SARAH P. WESSMANN, p.p.a. HENRY ROBERT WESSMANN, v. ROBERT P.

The percentage of under-represented minorities at Boston Latin fell from 35% in 1997 to under 19% in 2005, despite efforts by Boston Latin, the [[Boston Public Schools]], and the Boston Latin School Association to recruit more minority applicants and retain more minority students.\n\n===Curriculum===\n[[Declamation]] is the most time-honored of the school's traditions. Pupils in the 7th through 10th grade are required to give an oration, known as 'Declamation', in their English class three times during the year. There is also Public Declamation, where pupils from all grades, or classes, are welcomed to try out for the chance to declaim a memorized piece in front of an assembly. During Public Declamation, declaimers are scored on aspects such as \"Memorization\" \"Presentation\", and \"Voice and Delivery\", and those who score well in three of the first four public declamations are given the chance to declaim in front of alumni judges for awards in \"Prize Declamation\".\n[[File:Latin Public School.jpg|thumb|Front entrance of the school house on Avenue Louis Pasteur. 2007]]\nIn addition to the well-known and time-honored tradition of declamation in English classes, recently the Modern Languages department instituted an annual \"World Language Declamation\" competition. Once a year, during National Foreign Language Week (usually the first week of March),<ref>Kate Stevenson (2008). [https://web.archive.org/web/20060903084941/http://www.jc.edu/users/stevenso/FLAND/flwk.html National Foreign Language Week]</ref> students from grades 8 through 12 perform orations in languages other than English. Most students choose to declaim in the modern language they are studying, though some choose Latin, Greek, or their native tongue. Judges are brought in from various institutions around the city, and mark the students in similar categories to those used in Public Declamation. Entrants are categorized by level, rather than language, such that all students declaiming at the first-year level of various languages are competing against each other, all students at the second-year level compete against each other, and so on. Students who regularly perform exceptionally well at World Language Declamation are honored at Prize Night with the Celia Gordon Malkiel Prize.<ref>[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080414065452/http://www.bls.org/doc_content/PrizeSchol.pdf Prizes and Scholarships], ''BLS Web Site''</ref>\n\nIn a move that was controversial among some alumni, the school decided in 2001 to decrease the requirement for students' Latin instruction by one year, starting with the class of 2006.<ref>{{cite news |first=Anand |last=Vaishnav |title=Boston Latin Eases Language Requirement |url=http://www.boston.com/dailyglobe2/103/metro/Boston_Latin_eases_language_requirement+.shtml |work=[[Boston Globe]] |date=2001-04-13 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010416232616/http://www.boston.com/dailyglobe2/103/metro/Boston_Latin_eases_language_requirement%2B.shtml |archivedate=April 16, 2001 |accessdate=2007-12-31 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The mandatory minimum period of Latin instruction was decreased for students admitted for 7th grade from five years to four years, and for students admitted for 9th grade from four years to three years. This decision was made by the head of the school's Latin department, in recognition of the fact that the requirement was hampering students' ability to take enough courses in important modern subjects such as Physics, Chemistry, Computer Science and modern languages. However, students can still take Latin courses after their fourth year, in [[AP Latin]] and Latin 5, the latter if there is demand. Greek is additionally an option.\n\nIn a 1789 [[Codicil (will)|codicil]] to his will, Benjamin Franklin established a legacy to fund the Franklin Medals, which are awarded to the school's top-ranking pupils at graduation. The second most prestigious awards, the Dixwell Prizes, are given to pupils excelling in Latin or Greek.\n\n==Publications==\nThere are currently three main publications of the Boston Latin School: ''The Register'' is the school's literary magazine, ''The Argo'' the school newspaper, and ''Catapulta'' is the school science magazine. [[George Santayana]] founded ''The Register'' in 1881 to serve as the school newspaper. Over the years, however, it evolved into a purely literary magazine, publishing prose and poetry written by members of the student body, as well as artwork. There are generally three editors-in-chief, and it is published twice per year. ''The Argo'', the school's newspaper, is far younger, having been founded in 1970 after it was clear that the ''Register'' had become a purely literary magazine. As of the 2006\u20132007 school year, it is published seven times a year. ''Catapulta'', the science magazine, highlights popular and recent science and technology and is generally published four times a year. The ''Register'', the ''Argo'', and ''Catapulta'' are entirely student-produced, and the \"Argo\" and the \"Register\" have won awards from the New England Scholastic Press Association, while ''Catapulta'' has won awards from the American Scholastic Press Association.<ref>{{cite web\n|title=Publications\u2014Argo\n|url=http://bls.org/library/cfml/l3tmpl_archive.cfm?ArchiveID=36\n|work=BLS Web Site\n|accessdate=2007-06-01\n|archiveurl = https://archive.is/20070927034400/http://bls.org/library/cfml/l3tmpl_archive.cfm?ArchiveID=36 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-09-27}} Includes scans of first ''Argo'' edition, 1969.\n</ref>\n\nAnother Boston Latin publication is \"BLSA Bulletin\", published by the Boston Latin School Association, whose president is Peter G.

In the spring of 2017, in just its third season as a varsity sport, the girl's lacrosse team made the state tournament for the first time.\n\nIn the winter of 2015, Boston Latin launched its varsity boys fencing as well as varsity girls fencing, the only public school in Boston with fencing.\n\nIn the winter of the academic year 2015\u201316, the school's varsity fencing team took home the state championship title for the first time ever, with the men's team placing second overall and women's fourth overall.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nIn the spring of 2019, the school's boys varsity volleyball team took home its first DCL championship title since 2006.\n\n==Performing and Fine Arts==\n\nBoston Latin's Arts Department is among the best in the city, offering courses as well as ensembles for its students to join. \n\nThe school offers Visual Art class and a Music Fundamental class for 7th graders as well as a Theatre class for 8th graders for students who are not enrolled in any other form of art. The department also offers higher-level Visual Art classes in the 11th and 12th grades and the option to take AP Art for students who demonstrate proficiency in this discipline. An additional Theatre Studies course can be taken in these grades as well, covering the history and styles of theatrics.\n\nLatin School's Performing Arts provide opportunities for students from the 7th to 12th grade to learn and develop musical technique, as well as learn music theory in a classroom setting through AP Music Theory. The ensembles offered vary from beginner to high-level groups that compete at local and state competitions. Among the Performing Arts students have the option to participate in Chorus, Strings, Band, and Theatre (both in and out of school). The school's Wind Ensemble, Symphonic Band, Concert Strings Orchestra, and Concert Choir have received Gold Medals at MICCA competitions in the past. Extracurricular ensembles such as the Dues Band and Show Choir also compete for medals.\n\nThe Boston Latin School Big Band also competes in the Charles Mingus High School Jazz Festival, as well as the Essentially Ellington competition. Although they have not won the Ellington Competition, the band was one point off from being a Finalist in 2017. The band has been a Finalist in the Mingus Festival in 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020, winning the Non-Specialized High School category in 2018.\n\n==In popular culture==\n* In \"[[Six Meetings Before Lunch]]\", a first-season episode of ''[[The West Wing (TV series)|The West Wing]]'', [[Rob Lowe]]'s character [[Sam Seaborn]] mentioned Boston Latin School in a discussion of public school reform and [[school voucher]]s in American public education.

This is a [[double entendre]], referring both to the school's date of founding and its academic stature. Boston Latin has a history of pursuing the same standards as elite [[New England]] [[University-preparatory school|prep schools]] while adopting the egalitarian attitude of a [[Public school (government funded)|public school]]. Academically, the school regularly outperforms public schools in affluent Boston suburbs, particularly as measured by the yearly [[Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System|MCAS]] assessment required of all [[Massachusetts]] [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]]. In 2006, [[Brooklyn Latin School]] was founded in New York City, explicitly modeled on Boston Latin, borrowing much from its traditions and curriculum.<ref>{{cite news|first=Tracy|last=Jan|title=Growing a Boston Latin in Brooklyn|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2006/03/04/growing_a_boston_latin_in_brooklyn/|work=Boston Globe|date=March 4, 2006|accessdate=2007-08-31}}</ref>\n\n===Admissions===\nAdmission is determined by a combination of a student's score on the [[Independent School Entrance Examination]] (ISEE) and recent grades, and is limited to residents of the city of Boston.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bls.org/doc_content/ISEE%20QUESTIONS.pdf |title=Answers to Frequently Asked Questions about Entrance to Boston Latin School |accessdate=2007-12-31 |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229063010/http://www.bls.org/doc_content/ISEE%20QUESTIONS.pdf |archivedate=2008-02-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Although Boston Latin runs from the 7th through the 12th grade, it admits students only into the 7th and 9th grades.\n\nBecause it is a high-performing and well-regarded school, Boston Latin has been at the center of controversy concerning its admissions process. Admissions are very competitive, and it is not uncommon for fewer than 20% of applicants to be admitted. Before the 1997 school year, Boston Latin set aside a 35% [[Racial quota|quota]] of places in its incoming class for under-represented minorities. The school was forced to drop this policy after a series of lawsuits involving non-minority girls who were not admitted despite ranking higher than admitted minorities.<ref>See: Wessmann v. Gittens, 160 F. 3d 790 \u2013 Court of Appeals, 1st Circuit 1998 [[s:SARAH P. WESSMANN, p.p.a. HENRY ROBERT WESSMANN, v. ROBERT P.

The percentage of under-represented minorities at Boston Latin fell from 35% in 1997 to under 19% in 2005, despite efforts by Boston Latin, the [[Boston Public Schools]], and the Boston Latin School Association to recruit more minority applicants and retain more minority students.\n\n===Curriculum===\n[[Declamation]] is the most time-honored of the school's traditions. Pupils in the 7th through 10th grade are required to give an oration, known as 'Declamation', in their English class three times during the year. There is also Public Declamation, where pupils from all grades, or classes, are welcomed to try out for the chance to declaim a memorized piece in front of an assembly. During Public Declamation, declaimers are scored on aspects such as \"Memorization\" \"Presentation\", and \"Voice and Delivery\", and those who score well in three of the first four public declamations are given the chance to declaim in front of alumni judges for awards in \"Prize Declamation\".\n[[File:Latin Public School.jpg|thumb|Front entrance of the school house on Avenue Louis Pasteur. 2007]]\nIn addition to the well-known and time-honored tradition of declamation in English classes, recently the Modern Languages department instituted an annual \"World Language Declamation\" competition. Once a year, during National Foreign Language Week (usually the first week of March),<ref>Kate Stevenson (2008). [https://web.archive.org/web/20060903084941/http://www.jc.edu/users/stevenso/FLAND/flwk.html National Foreign Language Week]</ref> students from grades 8 through 12 perform orations in languages other than English. Most students choose to declaim in the modern language they are studying, though some choose Latin, Greek, or their native tongue. Judges are brought in from various institutions around the city, and mark the students in similar categories to those used in Public Declamation. Entrants are categorized by level, rather than language, such that all students declaiming at the first-year level of various languages are competing against each other, all students at the second-year level compete against each other, and so on. Students who regularly perform exceptionally well at World Language Declamation are honored at Prize Night with the Celia Gordon Malkiel Prize.<ref>[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080414065452/http://www.bls.org/doc_content/PrizeSchol.pdf Prizes and Scholarships], ''BLS Web Site''</ref>\n\nIn a move that was controversial among some alumni, the school decided in 2001 to decrease the requirement for students' Latin instruction by one year, starting with the class of 2006.<ref>{{cite news |first=Anand |last=Vaishnav |title=Boston Latin Eases Language Requirement |url=http://www.boston.com/dailyglobe2/103/metro/Boston_Latin_eases_language_requirement+.shtml |work=[[Boston Globe]] |date=2001-04-13 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010416232616/http://www.boston.com/dailyglobe2/103/metro/Boston_Latin_eases_language_requirement%2B.shtml |archivedate=April 16, 2001 |accessdate=2007-12-31 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The mandatory minimum period of Latin instruction was decreased for students admitted for 7th grade from five years to four years, and for students admitted for 9th grade from four years to three years. This decision was made by the head of the school's Latin department, in recognition of the fact that the requirement was hampering students' ability to take enough courses in important modern subjects such as Physics, Chemistry, Computer Science and modern languages. However, students can still take Latin courses after their fourth year, in [[AP Latin]] and Latin 5, the latter if there is demand. Greek is additionally an option.\n\nIn a 1789 [[Codicil (will)|codicil]] to his will, Benjamin Franklin established a legacy to fund the Franklin Medals, which are awarded to the school's top-ranking pupils at graduation. The second most prestigious awards, the Dixwell Prizes, are given to pupils excelling in Latin or Greek.\n\n==Publications==\nThere are currently three main publications of the Boston Latin School: ''The Register'' is the school's literary magazine, ''The Argo'' the school newspaper, and ''Catapulta'' is the school science magazine. [[George Santayana]] founded ''The Register'' in 1881 to serve as the school newspaper. Over the years, however, it evolved into a purely literary magazine, publishing prose and poetry written by members of the student body, as well as artwork. There are generally three editors-in-chief, and it is published twice per year. ''The Argo'', the school's newspaper, is far younger, having been founded in 1970 after it was clear that the ''Register'' had become a purely literary magazine. As of the 2006\u20132007 school year, it is published seven times a year. ''Catapulta'', the science magazine, highlights popular and recent science and technology and is generally published four times a year. The ''Register'', the ''Argo'', and ''Catapulta'' are entirely student-produced, and the \"Argo\" and the \"Register\" have won awards from the New England Scholastic Press Association, while ''Catapulta'' has won awards from the American Scholastic Press Association.<ref>{{cite web\n|title=Publications\u2014Argo\n|url=http://bls.org/library/cfml/l3tmpl_archive.cfm?ArchiveID=36\n|work=BLS Web Site\n|accessdate=2007-06-01\n|archiveurl = https://archive.is/20070927034400/http://bls.org/library/cfml/l3tmpl_archive.cfm?ArchiveID=36 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-09-27}} Includes scans of first ''Argo'' edition, 1969.\n</ref>\n\nAnother Boston Latin publication is \"BLSA Bulletin\", published by the Boston Latin School Association, whose president is Peter G.

In the spring of 2017, in just its third season as a varsity sport, the girl's lacrosse team made the state tournament for the first time.\n\nIn the winter of 2015, Boston Latin launched its varsity boys fencing as well as varsity girls fencing, the only public school in Boston with fencing.\n\nIn the winter of the academic year 2015\u201316, the school's varsity fencing team took home the state championship title for the first time ever, with the men's team placing second overall and women's fourth overall.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nIn the spring of 2019, the school's boys varsity volleyball team took home its first DCL championship title since 2006.\n\n==Performing and Fine Arts==\n\nBoston Latin's Arts Department is among the best in the city, offering courses as well as ensembles for its students to join. \n\nThe school offers Visual Art class and a Music Fundamental class for 7th graders as well as a Theatre class for 8th graders for students who are not enrolled in any other form of art. The department also offers higher-level Visual Art classes in the 11th and 12th grades and the option to take AP Art for students who demonstrate proficiency in this discipline. An additional Theatre Studies course can be taken in these grades as well, covering the history and styles of theatrics.\n\nLatin School's Performing Arts provide opportunities for students from the 7th to 12th grade to learn and develop musical technique, as well as learn music theory in a classroom setting through AP Music Theory. The ensembles offered vary from beginner to high-level groups that compete at local and state competitions. Among the Performing Arts students have the option to participate in Chorus, Strings, Band, and Theatre (both in and out of school). The school's Wind Ensemble, Symphonic Band, Concert Strings Orchestra, and Concert Choir have received Gold Medals at MICCA competitions in the past. Extracurricular ensembles such as the Dues Band and Show Choir also compete for medals.\n\nThe Boston Latin School Big Band also competes in the Charles Mingus High School Jazz Festival, as well as the Essentially Ellington competition. Although they have not won the Ellington Competition, the band was one point off from being a Finalist in 2017.

He was the second son of Andrina Johnston and Thomas Robertson of [[Skeld]], a merchant seaman. His father drowned before his first birthday, and his mother moved with her two sons to Stove in [[Walls, Shetland|Waas]].\n\nHe grew up in hardship though his love for the land and the people overcame that. It was to be the old Norse name for the area that he adopted as his ''[[nom-de-plume]]''. A shy boy who adjusted with difficulty to the rough and tumble of school, he was nonetheless able both at physical and intellectual pursuits, and in time he excelled. He took his MA at the [[University of Edinburgh]] and was offered the possibility of postgraduate work at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], which he turned down for financial reasons, instead becoming a teacher at the Lerwick Central School and carer to his ailing mother.\n\nIn 1953, he married Martha (\u2018Pat\u2019), daughter of the Reverend Robert Andrew, [[Church of Scotland]] minister in Walls for over 40 years, a girl he had known in childhood. She became a colleague and collaborator on many fronts, and together they edited ''Da Sangs at A\u2019ll sing ta Dee'' (The Songs that I'll sing to you), a collection of dialect songs and music (1973). One of his own lyric poems, ''[[Papa Stour#Culture and the arts|Da Sang o da Papa Men]]'', written from the perspective of the [[Papa Stour]] fishermen 'rowin [[Foula]] doon', has become a favourite Shetland song, to music composed by [[T. M. Y. Manson]].\n\nIn 1945, Vagaland was instrumental in the founding of the [[Shetland Folk Society]] and he was an office-bearer from its inception until his death after a long illness, in Lerwick on 30 December 1973. He was one of the writers who helped to establish ''[[The New Shetlander]]'' in 1947, and he was a key supporter of the journal for 27 years till his death. Each issue included at least one poem by Vagaland. With John J. Graham, he co-wrote 'Grammar and Usage of the Shetland Dialect' (1952); co-edited the influential anthology of Shetland verse and prose, 'Nordern Lights' (1964), both crucially important publications, and a number of volumes of ''The Shetland Folk Book''.\n\n:\" \u2026 His constant passion for maintaining the continuity of local tradition \u2026 was no mere antiquarian indulgence. It was fired by a real conviction, founded on personal experience, that the past revealed true insights into the art of living; that out of the lives of ordinary folk, engaged in their daily tasks and sustained by the warmth of close communities, there emerged basic truths about the human situation.

widespread service with the [[British Army]] during the [[First World War]].\n\n==Design==\nThe original Y Type was a 3-ton [[Two-wheel drive|4x2]] truck powered by a [[Daimler Company|Daimler]] four-cylinder inline 5,700 [[Cubic centimetre|cc]] petrol engine that developed {{convert|40|bhp|kW}} at 1,300 rpm, it drove the rear wheels through a four-speed gearbox, the wheels having solid rubber tyres.<ref name=Ware/><ref name=Davis/> The Y Type had an open, canvas covered cab and a fixed side timber body, typical of military cargo vehicles of the period.<ref name=Ware/>\n\nThe YA, introduced in 1917, replaced the Daimler engine with a Tylor four-cylinder inline 7,700 cc petrol engine that developed {{convert|49|bhp|kW}} at 1,300 rpm, the YB introduced a pressed steel frame whilst the YC used a [[David Brown Ltd.]] worm-gear [[final drive]].<ref name=Ware/><ref name=Davis/>\n\n==History==\nThe Y Type was introduced by AEC in March 1915, it was a lower geared development of AEC's earlier X Type, the latter a development of the company's W Type with heavier duty hubs.<ref name=Ware/> Whilst AEC was founded in 1912, a sales agreement meant that all of its products were marketed by and branded Daimler, in June 1916 the company's factory, at [[Walthamstow]], was placed under direct government control and the trucks were branded AEC from that date, although the Y

widespread service with the [[British Army]] during the [[First World War]].\n\n==Design==\nThe original Y Type was a 3 ton [[Two-wheel drive|4x2]] truck powered by a [[Daimler Company |Daimler]] four-cylinder inline 5,700 [[Cubic centimetre|cc]] petrol engine that developed {{convert|40|bhp|kW}} at 1,300 rpm, it drove the rear wheels through a four-speed gearbox, the wheels having solid rubber tyres.<ref name=Ware/><ref name=Davis/> The Y Type had an open, canvas covered cab and a fixed side timber body, typical of military cargo vehicles of the period.<ref name=Ware/>\n\nThe YA, introduced in 1917, replaced the Daimler engine with a Tylor four-cylinder inline 7,700 cc petrol engine that developed {{convert|49|bhp|kW}} at 1,300 rpm, the YB introduced a pressed steel frame whilst the YC used a [[David Brown Ltd.]] worm-gear [[final drive]].<ref name=Ware/><ref name=Davis/>\n\n==History==\nThe Y Type was introduced by AEC in March 1915, it was a lower geared development of AEC's earlier X Type, the latter a development of the company's W Type with heavier duty hubs.<ref name=Ware/> Whilst AEC was founded in 1912, a sales agreement meant that all of its products were marketed by and branded Daimler, in June 1916 the company's factory, at [[Walthamstow]], was placed under direct government control and the trucks were branded AEC from that date, although the Y Type\u2019s distinctive Daimler radiator was retained.<ref name=Ware/>\n\nThe Y Type was in high demand by British forces during the First World War, in 1917 AEC installed a moving [[assembly line]]

An exclusive micro-edition of 60 copies was also published, featuring an original piece of art, while all copies of the book contained a postcard with a handwritten excerpt from the book.
