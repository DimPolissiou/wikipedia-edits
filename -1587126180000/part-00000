Frederick then appealed to the Juneau School Board, which upheld the suspension on March 19, 2002.\n\n===District court===\n{{Youth rights sidebar|Activities}}\nOn April&nbsp;25, 2002, Frederick filed a [[Civil Rights Act of 1871|civil rights]] lawsuit (under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983) against Morse and the school board, claiming they violated his federal and state constitutional rights to free speech.<ref name=Mears/> He sought a [[declaratory relief]] (for a declaratory judgment that his First Amendment rights had been violated), [[Injunction|injunctive]] relief (for an injunction to remove the reference to the ten-day suspension from his school records), and monetary awards ([[Compensatory damages#Compensatory damages|compensatory damages]], [[punitive damages]], and [[attorney's fee]]s).<ref name=MvF4>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 399.</ref>\n\nThe [[United States District Court for the District of Alaska]] dismissed Frederick's case on [[summary judgment]].<ref>''Frederick v. Morse'', No. J 02-008 CV(JWS), 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27270 (D. Alaska May 27, 2003).</ref> The district court reasoned that ''[[Bethel School District No. 403 v. Fraser]]'', as opposed to ''[[Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District]]'', governed Frederick's [[school speech]]. Under this premise, the Court ruled that, given the stipulated facts, Morse and the school board had not infringed Frederick's First Amendment rights, because Morse had reasonably interpreted the banner as contravening the school's policies on [[drug abuse]] prevention.<ref name=MvF4/><ref group=\"nb\">The Court also ruled that, if Frederick's constitutional rights had been violated, Appellees had [[qualified immunity]].</ref>\n\n===Ninth Circuit===\nThe [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit]] reversed the decision of the District Court. The unanimous panel decision was written by Judge [[Andrew Kleinfeld]].<ref>''Frederick v. Morse'', 439 F.3d 1114.</ref>\n\nFirst, the Court decided that the incident should be interpreted under [[school speech|school-speech doctrines]], even though Frederick was standing across the street, and not on school grounds.{{#tag:ref|The Ninth Circuit elaborated:\n\n{{quote|One amicus, Drug Policy Alliance, argues that we should analyze this not as a student speech case, but simply as speech on a public sidewalk. That would make the case analogous to a student having an after-school job at a video store that rents out Cheech and Chong tapes, or a student driving a car on public streets with a \"Bong Hits 4 Jesus\" bumper sticker. Were this factually such a case, the law would be easy indeed, but the facts established by the submissions on summary judgment make this a student speech case. Even though Frederick never got to school that morning, that was only because he got stuck in his driveway because of the snow. School had started and the students were released to watch the Olympic torch pass. And even though supervision of most students was minimal or nonexistent, the school could have supervised them more if it chose to, as it did with the gym class and perhaps the pep band and cheerleaders. Frederick was a student, and school was in session.\n\nThere is no genuine issue of fact material to the decision. Frederick's display was not in a class. Frederick and the other students who displayed the sign did not participate in any of the disorderly conduct of the students who threw snowballs or plastic Coca-Cola miniature sample bottles. The school principal and school board do not claim that the display disrupted or was expected to disrupt any classroom work. They concede that their objection to the display, and the reason why the principal ripped down the banner, was not concern that it would cause disruption but that its message would be understood as advocating or promoting illegal drug use. Frederick says that the words were just nonsense meant to attract television cameras because they were funny. We nevertheless proceed on the basis that the banner expressed a positive sentiment about marijuana use, however vague and nonsensical.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>}}|group=\"nb\"}}\n\nThus, for Judge Kleinfeld, \"the question comes down to whether a school may, in the absence of concern about disruption of educational activities, punish and censor non-disruptive, off-campus speech by students during school-authorized activities because the speech promotes a social message contrary to the one favored by the school. The answer under controlling, long-existing precedent is plainly 'No'.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Frederick v. Morse'', 439 F.3d at 1118.</ref> To reach this determination, the Court inquired whether Frederick's constitutional rights were violated.{{#tag:ref|The Ninth Circuit explained:\n\n<blockquote>Because this is a section 1983 case in which the Appellees asserted qualified immunity, we are required to proceed in accord with ''Saucier v. Katz'' and determine first whether Frederick's constitutional rights were violated. This is an \"as applied\" challenge, not a \"facial\" challenge. Frederick argues that his rights were violated as the regulations were applied to him. Under ''Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District'', they plainly were.</blockquote> (See also: ''[[Saucier v. Katz]]''.) |group=\"nb\"}}. The Court, in holding (contra the District Court) that ''[[Tinker v.

Frederick'' (No. 06-278).</ref> [[Kenneth Starr]] first spoke on behalf of the petitioning school principal. He described the rule in ''[[Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District]]'', {{Ussc|393|503|1969}} as \"that there is a right to political speech subject to disruption\u2014that the speech not be disruptive\".<ref>Transcript of Oral Argument at 4, ''Morse v. Frederick'' (No. 06-278).</ref> He defined the disruptiveness in general terms as behavior inimical to the educational mission of the school, and in specific terms as a violation of the school's announced policy to enforce and support laws with respect to the control of marijuana (and other laws in general). Starr also cited the cases of ''[[Bethel School District v. Fraser]]'', {{Ussc|478|675|1986}} and ''[[Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeier]]'', {{Ussc|484|260|1988}}.\n\nStarr noted that in ''Tinker'' there was no written policy; it was an issue of \"standardless discretion\" being exercised.<ref>Transcript of Oral Argument at 10, ''Morse v. Frederick'' (No. 06-278).</ref> That case was said to be concerned with school disciplinary actions \"casting a pall of orthodoxy to prevent the discussion of ideas\".<ref>Transcript of Oral Argument at 11, ''Morse v. Frederick'' (No. 06-278).</ref> [[David Souter|Justice Souter]] remarked that 'Bong Hits 4 JESUS' \"sounds like just a kid's provocative statement to me\".<ref>Transcript of Oral Argument at 17, ''Morse v. Frederick'' (No. 06-278).</ref> Starr responded by saying \"the key is to allow the school official to interpret the message as long as that interpretation is reasonable.\"<ref>Transcript of Oral Argument at 18, ''Morse v. Frederick'' (No. 06-278).</ref>\n\nDeputy Solicitor-General [[Edwin Kneedler]] spoke on behalf of the U.S. government in support of the petitioner. He said: \"The First Amendment does not require public school officials to stand aside and permit students who are entrusted to their supervision and care to promote or encourage the illegal use of drugs.\"<ref>Transcript of Oral Argument at 19, ''Morse v. Frederick'' (No. 06-278).</ref> He cited the cases of ''[[Board of Education v. Earls]]'' and ''[[Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier|Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeier]]'' in his favor.\n\nDouglas K. Mertz, of [[Juneau, Alaska|Juneau]], Alaska, for the respondent opened, \"This is a case about free speech. It is not about drugs.\" [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[John Roberts]] responded: \"It's a case about money. Your client wants money from the principal personally for her actions in this case.\" Mertz emphasized that the torch relay was not school-sponsored; that he had not stepped on school property at all before unfurling the banner; that \"BONG HiTS 4 JESUS\" was intended to be\u2014and was regarded as\u2014a purely humorous message; and that the unfurling of the banner did not cause any disruption. Based on these facts, he concludes, his case \"does not present the issue of school authority over student expressions on campus or in a school-sponsored activity\".\n\nStarr rebutted. He cited ''[[Vernonia School District 47J v. Acton]]'' and ''[[Board of Education v. Earls]]'' as cases demonstrative of the Court's strong past stances on matter related to combating the \"scourge of drugs\". In closing and in summary, he said:\n\n{{quote|To promote drugs is utterly inconsistent with the educational mission of the school. The court has spoken more broadly with respect to the need to defer to school officials in identifying the educational mission. We know that there are constitutional limits (to lawful political expression). Those limits are captured in ''Tinker''. A passive pure political speech that reflects on the part of the school board a standardless discretionary effort to squelch any kind of controversial discussion, that casts a pall of orthodoxy over the class room: we are light years away from that.<ref>Transcript of Oral Argument at 59, ''Morse v. Frederick'' (No. 06-278).</ref>}}\n\n==Opinions{{anchor|Opinions}}==\n\n===Opinion of the Court===\nChief Justice Roberts, writing for a plurality of four justices, concluded that the school officials did not violate the First Amendment by confiscating the pro-drug banner and suspending the student responsible for it. After reciting the background in Part&nbsp;I of the opinion, in Part&nbsp;II he determined that \"[[school speech (First Amendment)|school speech]]\" doctrine should apply because Frederick's speech occurred \"at a school event\"; Part&nbsp;III determined that the speech was \"reasonably viewed as promoting illegal drug use\"; and Part&nbsp;IV, inquired whether a principal may legally restrict that speech, concluding that she could\u2014under the three existing First Amendment school speech precedents, other Constitutional jurisprudence relating to schools, and a school's \"important\u2014indeed, perhaps compelling interest\" in deterring drug use by students.\n\n====Speech falls under school speech jurisprudence====\nFirst, Roberts determined that the Court should analyze Frederick's speech under the comparatively strict doctrine of \"[[school speech (First Amendment)|school speech]]\"\u2014rejecting \"at the outset\" Frederick's contention that the case should instead be considered under ordinary free-speech jurisprudence.<ref name=slip5-6>Morse, 551 U.S. at 400-01.</ref> While conceding that past precedent reflects \"some uncertainty at the outer boundaries as to when courts should apply school-speech precedents\",<ref>Here the court provided the following string citation:<br />''[[Porter v. Ascension Parish School Bd.]]'', 393 F. 3d 608, 615, n. 22 (CA5 2004)</ref> Roberts added: \"but not on these facts\".<ref name=slip5-6/> Roberts reiterated the circumstances, then explained: \"Under these circumstances, we agree with the superintendent that Frederick cannot 'stand in the midst of his fellow students, during school hours, at a school-sanctioned activity and claim he is not at school.'\"<ref name=slip5-6/>\n\n====Principal reasonably interpreted speech====\n\nNext, Roberts determined that the principal's conclusion that Frederick's banner \"advocated the use of illegal drugs\" was reasonable. Acknowledging that the banner's message was \"cryptic\", nevertheless it was undeniably a \"reference to illegal drugs\".<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 402.</ref> In reaching this conclusion, Roberts contrasted \"the paucity of alternative meanings the banner might bear\" against the fact that the two immediately available interpretations of the words support this conclusion:\n{{Quote|First, the phrase could be interpreted as an imperative: \"[Take] bong hits&nbsp;...\"\u2014a message equivalent, as Morse explained in her declaration, to \"smoke marijuana\" or \"use an illegal drug\". Alternatively, the phrase could be viewed as celebrating drug use\u2014\"bong hits [are a good thing]\", or \"[we take] bong hits\".}}\nAnd even if that second interpretation does not support the principal's conclusions that the banner advocated the use of illegal drugs,\n{{Quote|we discern no meaningful distinction between celebrating illegal drug use in the midst of fellow students and outright advocacy or promotion. See ''[[Guiles v. Marineau]]'', 461 F.3d 320, 328 (CA2 2006) (discussing the present case and describing the sign as \"a clearly pro-drug banner\")}}\nWrapping up this discussion, Roberts rejected the two alternative accounts for Frederick's speech provided in the dissent: first, the dissent noted that Frederick \"just wanted to get on television\", which it characterized as a \"credible and uncontradicted explanation for the message\". Roberts rejoined: \"But that is a description of Frederick's motive for displaying the banner; it is not an interpretation of what the banner says.\" Second, the dissent emphasized the importance of political speech and the need to foster \"national debate about a serious issue\". Roberts rejoined that \"not even Frederick argues that the banner conveys any sort of political or religious message\"; \"this is plainly not a case about political debate over the criminalization of drug use or possession.\"\n\n====First Amendment permits schools to restrict such speech====\nFinally, Roberts inquired whether a principal may restrict such speech. He concluded that she can.<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 403.</ref>\n\nHe began by reviewing the court's [[school speech (First Amendment)|school speech]] jurisprudence:\n* First, Roberts recapitulated that student expression may be suppressed only if school officials reasonably conclude that it will \"materially and substantially disrupt the work and discipline of the school\"\u2014observing however that this doctrine came from a case (''[[Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School Dist.]]'') in which the students were engaging in \"political speech\" in \"a silent, passive expression of opinion, unaccompanied by any disorder or disturbance\" (wearing armbands, to express \"disapproval of the Vietnam hostilities and their advocacy of a truce, to make their views known, and, by their example, to influence others to adopt them\". Id., at 514), and in which \"[t]he only interest the Court discerned underlying the school's actions was the \"mere desire to avoid the discomfort and unpleasantness that always accompany an unpopular viewpoint\", or \"an urgent wish to avoid the controversy which might result from the expression\". Roberts commented on this opinion with a quote from ''[[Virginia v. Black]]''\u2014that political speech is \"at the core of what the First Amendment is designed to protect\". 538 U.S. 343, 365 (2003).\n* Second, Roberts cited ''[[Bethel School Dist. No. 403 v. Fraser]]''. The jurisprudence of ''Fraser'' is controversial, but Roberts declined to apply or resolve the disputed holding of that case (\"We need not resolve this debate to decide this case\"); instead, he explained that \"[f]or present purposes, it is enough to distill from ''Fraser'' two basic principles\":\n::#that \"the constitutional rights of students in public school are not automatically coextensive with the rights of adults in other settings\" (\"in light of the special characteristics of the school environment\").<ref>Here, Roberts cited {{ussc|name=Cohen v. California|volume=403|page=15|pin=|year=1971}}.</ref>\n::#that the \"substantial disruption\" analysis prescribed by Tinker \"is not absolute\" (i.e., it is flexible/optional).<ref>Here, Roberts cited {{ussc|name=Hazelwood School Dist. v. Kuhlmeier|link=Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier|volume=484|page=260}}, 271, n. 4 (1988) (disagreeing with the proposition that there is \"no difference between the First Amendment analysis applied in Tinker and that applied in Fraser\", and noting that the holding in Fraser was not based on any showing of substantial disruption).</ref>\n* Third, Roberts cited the most recent student speech case, ''[[Hazelwood School Dist. v. Kuhlmeier]]''. In that case, the Court permitted a school to \"exercise editorial control over the style and content of student speech in school-sponsored expressive activities\" (declining to publish articles in the school paper that \"the public might reasonably perceive to bear the imprimatur of the school\") \"so long as their actions are reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns\". Roberts found that this case, though factually distinct, was \"nevertheless instructive because it confirms both principles cited above\".\n\nRoberts then cited cases that cited Tinker in the course of interpreting the qualified status that other Constitutional rights acquire in schools\u2014''[[Vernonia School Dist. 47J v. Acton]]'', ''[[New Jersey v. T.&nbsp;L.&nbsp;O.]]'', ''[[Board of Ed. of Independent School Dist. No.&nbsp;92 of Pottawatomie Cty. v. Earls]]''.<!-- this content isn\u2019t appropriate for this article; I am preserving it so I can move it to a new article on school speech.\n* \"while children assuredly do not 'shed their constitutional rights ... at the schoolhouse gate,' ... the nature of those rights is what is appropriate for children in school.\"<ref>Here, Roberts cited to:<br />''[[Vernonia School Dist. 47J v.

No. 92 of Pottawatomie Cty. v. Earls]]'', 536 U.S. 822, 829-830 (2002) (quoting ''Vernonia'', 515 U.S., at 656; citation and some internal quotation marks omitted).</ref>\n--> In light of these concerns, Roberts devoted his lengthiest analysis to the government's \"important \u2014 indeed, perhaps compelling interest\" in deterring drug use by students.<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 394-95.</ref> To this point, the opinion cited statistics illustrating the problems of youth drug abuse. It further noted that part of a school's educational mission is \"to educate students about the dangers of illegal drugs and to discourage their use\".<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 398-99.</ref> The District Court also noted \"peer pressure is perhaps 'the single most important factor leading school children to take drugs.'\"<ref name=MvF14>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 408.</ref> The Court's interpretation of Frederick's banner deemed the banner as a type of peer pressure. Based on these concerns, the opinion concluded that the principal's actions were motivated by a \"serious and palpable\" danger of drug abuse quite different from the amorphous fears of anti-war sentiment at play in ''Tinker''.<ref name=MvF14/>\n\nIn ''Tinker'', the school principal had punished students for wearing black anti-war armbands based on his \"undifferentiated fear or apprehension of disturbance\" or \"mere desire to avoid ... discomfort and unpleasantness\".<ref name=MvF14/> Here, however, the concern about student drug abuse \"extends well beyond an abstract desire to avoid controversy\".<ref name=MvF14/> Principal Morse's failure to act against the banner \"would send a powerful message to the students in her charge, including Frederick, about how serious the school was about the dangers of illegal drug use\".<ref name=MvF15>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 410.</ref> The First Amendment, concluded the opinion, \"does not require schools to tolerate at school events student expression that contributes to those dangers\".<ref name=MvF15/>\n\n===Concurrences===\nJustice [[Clarence Thomas]] wrote a concurrence that argued that students in public schools do not have a right to free speech and that ''Tinker'' should be overturned. Thomas wrote, \"In my view, the history of public education suggests that the First Amendment, as originally understood, does not protect student speech in public schools.\"<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 410-11 (Thomas, J., concurring).</ref> He praised [[Hugo Black]]'s dissenting opinion on ''Tinker'' and called it \"prophetic\". Thomas cited the doctrine of ''[[in loco parentis]]'', meaning \"in place of the parent\", in his opinion. He traced the history of public education in America back to its colonial roots. According to Thomas, because originally public schools were intended to substitute for private tutors, public schools could discipline students as they liked and had a far stronger hand in what happened in the classroom. \"In short\", he continues, \"in the earliest public schools, teachers taught, and students listened. Teachers commanded, and students obeyed.\"<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 412 (Thomas, J., concurring).</ref> He opined that because parents entrusted the care of their children to teachers, teachers have a right to act in the place of parents during school hours. Therefore, teachers should be able to discipline students if necessary. Thomas lambasted ''Tinker'' for \"usurping [the local school district as a] traditional authority for the judiciary\".<ref name=Thomas421>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 421 (Thomas, J., concurring).</ref> Thomas believed that Frederick was neither speaking gibberish nor openly advocating drug use, but granting such an impertinence constitutional protection \"would ... be to 'surrender control of the American public school system to public school students.'\"<ref name=Thomas421/>\n\nJustice [[Samuel Alito]], joined by Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]], wrote a concurrence indicating that he agreed with the majority opinion to the extent that:\n\n{{quote|(a) it goes no further than to hold that a public school may restrict speech that a reasonable observer would interpret as advocating illegal drug use and (b) it provides no support for any restriction of speech that can plausibly be interpreted as commenting on any political or social issue, including speech on issues such as \"the wisdom of the war on drugs or of legalizing marijuana for medicinal use\".<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 422 (Alito, J., concurring).</ref>}}\n\nAlito agreed that Morse did not violate Frederick's First Amendment rights and emphasized in his concurrence that the holding only applies to students who advocate illegal drug use. He opposed the \"educational mission\" and ''[[in loco parentis]]'' analysis in favor of a \"special characteristic\" of schools that he identifies to be ensuring the physical safety of the students. Alito concluded that an exception must be made to the First Amendment free speech guarantee to protect the students; since according to Alito, advocating illegal drugs possibly leads to violence. But Alito insisted that this small reduction of what is protected by the First Amendment is \"at the far reaches of what the First Amendment permits\".<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 426 (Alito, J., concurring).</ref>\n\n===Concurrence in part and dissent in part===\nJustice [[Stephen Breyer]] concurred in the judgment in part and dissented in part, arguing that the Court should not have directly answered the First Amendment question in the case, but rather decided it based on [[qualified immunity]]. Qualified immunity is an [[affirmative defense]] that requires courts to enter judgment in favor of a government employee accused of violating individual rights unless the employee's conduct violates \"clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known\".<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 429 (Breyer, J., concurring).</ref> Because it was not clear whether the school principal's actions in taking down the banner violated the First Amendment, Breyer would have simply issued a narrow decision indicating that she was shielded by qualified immunity and gone no further.<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 425-26 (Breyer, J., concurring).</ref>\n\n===Dissent===\nJustice [[John Paul Stevens]], in a dissent joined by Justice [[David Souter|Souter]] and Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg|Ginsburg]], argued that \"the Court does serious violence to the First Amendment in upholding\u2014indeed, lauding\u2014a school's decision to punish Frederick for expressing a view with which it disagreed.\"<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 435 (Stevens, J., dissenting).</ref> Stevens wrote:\n\n{{quote|... the school's interest in protecting its students from exposure to speech 'reasonably regarded as promoting illegal drug use' ... cannot justify disciplining Frederick for his attempt to make an ambiguous statement to a television audience simply because it contained an oblique reference to drugs. The First Amendment demands more, indeed, much more.<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 434 (Stevens, J., dissenting).</ref>}}\n\nStevens criticized the majority decision as one that \"trivializes the two cardinal principles upon which ''Tinker'' rests\", because it \"upholds a punishment meted out on the basis of a listener's disagreement with her understanding (or, more likely, misunderstanding) of the speaker's viewpoint\".<ref name=SJ5>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 437 (Stevens, J., dissenting).</ref> Moreover, he noted, \"Encouraging drug use might well increase the likelihood that a listener will try an illegal drug, but that hardly justifies censorship\".<ref name=SJ5/> \"[C]arving out pro-drug speech for uniquely harsh treatment finds no support in our case law and is inimical to the values protected by the First Amendment.\"<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 438-39 (Stevens, J., dissenting).</ref>\n\nStevens also took issue with the majority's interpretation of the banner as being a serious incitement to drug use:\n\n{{quote|Admittedly, some high school students (including those who use drugs) are dumb.

These tragic events led to a significant number of cases and articles on the subject of school violence. For example, in Wisniewski, a student was suspended after school officials learned of an instant messenger icon he had created that depicted the shooting of his English teacher. 494 F.3d at 35. In one of the few decisions citing to Morse, the Second Circuit declined to consider whether the true threat doctrine was relevant, and instead applied ''Tinker'''s substantial disruption test. Id. at 38\u201339. The court held that the school did not violate the student's First Amendment rights by suspending him because it was reasonably foreseeable that the icon would come to school officials' attention and cause a disruption at school. Id. at 39\u201340.\n\nFor a discussion of the true threat doctrine's application to student speech, see Andrew P. Stanner, Note, Toward an Improved True Threat Doctrine for Student Speakers, 81 ''NYU Law Review'', 385 (2006). For additional discussion of the true threat doctrine, see generally Richard Salgado, Protecting Student Speech Rights While Increasing School Safety: School Jurisdiction and the Search for Warning Signs in a Post-Columbine/Red Lake Environment, 2005 ''BYU Law Review'', 1371 (citing to many articles on the true threat doctrine); Jennifer E.

Frederick'': How Will ''Morse v. Frederick'' Be Applied?\" 12 ''Lewis & Clark Law Review'', 1</ref> noting that Chief Justice Roberts \"sought to keep the decision quite narrow\", limiting the case \"to the issue of public school administrators' ability to keep the educational process free from messages about illegal drugs\" and drawing from the Court's existing student speech jurisprudence that \"permitted school administrators broad discretion to keep out of the educational environment antisocial messages celebrating drug use\".<ref name=lewisclark />\n\n===Erwin Chemerinsky===\nLeading constitutional law scholar [[Erwin Chemerinsky]] participated in the same symposium, exploring how this decision would be understood and applied by school officials, school boards, and lower court judges. He suggested that the opinion was misguided and\u2014from a First Amendment perspective\u2014highly undesirable, arguing that the decision cannot be justified under existing First Amendment principles, that it could be seen as authorizing punishment of students for speech that is deemed distasteful or offensive, even just juvenile. However, he noted Justice Alito's concurring opinion, which suggests that the majority opinion might be exceedingly narrow and based on a very unusual factual context; Chemerinsky noted that if Justice Alito's opinion is seen as defining the scope of the holding, then the case establishes only the power of schools to punish speech encouraging illegal drug use rather than giving school officials great discretion to punish student speech. Thus, despite the fact that ''Morse v. Frederick'' is consistent with decisions from the Supreme Court and lower federal courts over the last two decades, his hope is that Chief Justice Roberts's majority opinion will be read through the prism of Justice Alito's concurring opinion, thereby having little effect on the already very limited First Amendment rights of students.<ref name=lewisclark />\n\n==Subsequent judicial interpretation==\nMelinda Cupps Dickler noted that \"The few courts that have discussed Morse have disagreed about the breadth of its holding,\"<ref name=\"Dickler\">Melinda Cupps Dickler (Visiting Assistant Professor at Chicago-Kent College of Law, Illinois Institute of Technology), \"The Morse Quartet: Student Speech And The First Amendment\", 53 ''Loyola Law Review'', 355. {{doi|10.2139/ssrn.1009601 }}</ref> supporting this claim with the following citations:\n\n::Compare ''Lowery v.

Fulton County Sch. Dist.'', 494 F.3d 978, 9984 (11th Cir. 2007) (holding that Morse's holding is broad). The ''Layshock'' court stated that ''Morse'' did not change the basic framework established by the ''Tinker'' trilogy, which it described as a scheme in which ''Fraser'' and ''Kuhlmeier'' are exceptions to ''Tinker's'' general rule. ''Layshock'', 496 F. Supp. 2d at 596. Significantly, however, the court cited to both ''Morse'' and ''Tinker'' as requiring courts to defer to school officials' decisions about punishing student speech. ''Id''. at 597. On the other hand, the court also accepted Justice Alito's concurring argument in ''Morse'' when it held that ''Morse'' does not permit school officials to regulate student speech merely on the basis that it is incompatible with the schools' educational missions. ''Id''. at 599.\n\n::By contrast, the Eleventh Circuit extended ''Morse's'' rationale about illegal drugs to the context of student speech that is \"construed as a threat of school violence\". ''Boim'', 494 F.3d at 984 (upholding the suspension of a high school student for a story labeled as a \"dream\" in which she described shooting her math teacher). Moreover, the court concluded that Morse supports the idea that student speech can be regulated where \"[in] a school administrator's professional observation ... certain expressions [of student speech] have led to, and therefore could lead to, an unhealthy and potentially unsafe learning environment\". Id. at 983 (quoting ''Scott v. Sch. Bd.'', 324 F.3d 1246, 1247 (11th Cir. 2003)). Some commentators predict that courts will extend Morse to further restrict protection for student speech. See, e.g., Hilden, supra note 12 (discussing ''Wisniewski v. Bd. of Educ. of Weedsport Cent. Sch. Dist.'', 494 F.3d 34 (2d Cir. 2007)); see also infra text accompanying note 17 (providing further discussion of ''Wisniewski'', in which the Second Circuit cited to Morse, but applied Tinker).\n\n==Groups involved==\nThe [[American Civil Liberties Union]] directly participated in this case on the side of Joseph Frederick.

When Principal Morse crossed the street from the school and confronted Frederick about the banner, he asked \"What about the Bill of Rights and freedom of speech?\" She told him to take the banner down because she \"felt that it violated the policy against displaying offensive material, including material that advertises or promotes use of illegal drugs\", and she grabbed it from him and crumpled it up.<ref>''Frederick v.

Fraser]]'', as opposed to ''[[Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District]]'', governed Frederick's [[school speech]]. Under this premise, the Court ruled that, given the stipulated facts, Morse and the school board had not infringed Frederick's First Amendment rights, because Morse had reasonably interpreted the banner as contravening the school's policies on [[drug abuse]] prevention.<ref name=MvF4/><ref group=\"nb\">The Court also ruled that, if Frederick's constitutional rights had been violated, Appellees had [[qualified immunity]].</ref>\n\n===Ninth Circuit===\nThe [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit]] reversed the decision of the District Court. The unanimous panel decision was written by Judge [[Andrew Kleinfeld]].<ref>''Frederick v. Morse'', 439 F.3d 1114.</ref>\n\nFirst, the Court decided that the incident should be interpreted under [[school speech|school-speech doctrines]], even though Frederick was standing across the street, and not on school grounds.{{#tag:ref|The Ninth Circuit elaborated:\n\n{{quote|One amicus, Drug Policy Alliance, argues that we should analyze this not as a student speech case, but simply as speech on a public sidewalk. That would make the case analogous to a student having an after-school job at a video store that rents out Cheech and Chong tapes, or a student driving a car on public streets with a \"Bong Hits 4 Jesus\" bumper sticker. Were this factually such a case, the law would be easy indeed, but the facts established by the submissions on summary judgment make this a student speech case. Even though Frederick never got to school that morning, that was only because he got stuck in his driveway because of the snow. School had started and the students were released to watch the Olympic torch pass. And even though supervision of most students was minimal or nonexistent, the school could have supervised them more if it chose to, as it did with the gym class and perhaps the pep band and cheerleaders. Frederick was a student, and school was in session.\n\nThere is no genuine issue of fact material to the decision. Frederick's display was not in a class. Frederick and the other students who displayed the sign did not participate in any of the disorderly conduct of the students who threw snowballs or plastic Coca-Cola miniature sample bottles. The school principal and school board do not claim that the display disrupted or was expected to disrupt any classroom work. They concede that their objection to the display, and the reason why the principal ripped down the banner, was not concern that it would cause disruption but that its message would be understood as advocating or promoting illegal drug use. Frederick says that the words were just nonsense meant to attract television cameras because they were funny. We nevertheless proceed on the basis that the banner expressed a positive sentiment about marijuana use, however vague and nonsensical.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>}}|group=\"nb\"}}\n\nThus, for Judge Kleinfeld, \"the question comes down to whether a school may, in the absence of concern about disruption of educational activities, punish and censor non-disruptive, off-campus speech by students during school-authorized activities because the speech promotes a social message contrary to the one favored by the school. The answer under controlling, long-existing precedent is plainly 'No'.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Frederick v. Morse'', 439 F.3d at 1118.</ref> To reach this determination, the Court inquired whether Frederick's constitutional rights were violated.{{#tag:ref|The Ninth Circuit explained:\n\n<blockquote>Because this is a section 1983 case in which the Appellees asserted qualified immunity, we are required to proceed in accord with ''Saucier v. Katz'' and determine first whether Frederick's constitutional rights were violated. This is an \"as applied\" challenge, not a \"facial\" challenge. Frederick argues that his rights were violated as the regulations were applied to him. Under ''Tinker v.

Starr also cited the cases of ''[[Bethel School District v. Fraser]]'', {{Ussc|478|675|1986}} and ''[[Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeier]]'', {{Ussc|484|260|1988}}.\n\nStarr noted that in ''Tinker'' there was no written policy; it was an issue of \"standardless discretion\" being exercised.<ref>Transcript of Oral Argument at 10, ''Morse v.

Mertz, of [[Juneau, Alaska|Juneau]], Alaska, for the respondent opened, \"This is a case about free speech. It is not about drugs.\" [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[John Roberts]] responded: \"It's a case about money. Your client wants money from the principal personally for her actions in this case.\" Mertz emphasized that the torch relay was not school-sponsored; that he had not stepped on school property at all before unfurling the banner; that \"BONG HiTS 4 JESUS\" was intended to be\u2014and was regarded as\u2014a purely humorous message; and that the unfurling of the banner did not cause any disruption. Based on these facts, he concludes, his case \"does not present the issue of school authority over student expressions on campus or in a school-sponsored activity\".\n\nStarr rebutted. He cited ''[[Vernonia School District 47J v. Acton]]'' and ''[[Board of Education v. Earls]]'' as cases demonstrative of the Court's strong past stances on matter related to combating the \"scourge of drugs\". In closing and in summary, he said:\n\n{{quote|To promote drugs is utterly inconsistent with the educational mission of the school. The court has spoken more broadly with respect to the need to defer to school officials in identifying the educational mission. We know that there are constitutional limits (to lawful political expression). Those limits are captured in ''Tinker''.

Frederick'' (No. 06-278).</ref>}}\n\n==Opinions{{anchor|Opinions}}==\n\n===Opinion of the Court===\nChief Justice Roberts, writing for a plurality of four justices, concluded that the school officials did not violate the First Amendment by confiscating the pro-drug banner and suspending the student responsible for it. After reciting the background in Part&nbsp;I of the opinion, in Part&nbsp;II he determined that \"[[school speech (First Amendment)|school speech]]\" doctrine should apply because Frederick's speech occurred \"at a school event\"; Part&nbsp;III determined that the speech was \"reasonably viewed as promoting illegal drug use\"; and Part&nbsp;IV, inquired whether a principal may legally restrict that speech, concluding that she could\u2014under the three existing First Amendment school speech precedents, other Constitutional jurisprudence relating to schools, and a school's \"important\u2014indeed, perhaps compelling interest\" in deterring drug use by students.\n\n====Speech falls under school speech jurisprudence====\nFirst, Roberts determined that the Court should analyze Frederick's speech under the comparatively strict doctrine of \"[[school speech (First Amendment)|school speech]]\"\u2014rejecting \"at the outset\" Frederick's contention that the case should instead be considered under ordinary free-speech jurisprudence.<ref name=slip5-6>Morse, 551 U.S. at 400-01.</ref> While conceding that past precedent reflects \"some uncertainty at the outer boundaries as to when courts should apply school-speech precedents\",<ref>Here the court provided the following string citation:<br />''[[Porter v. Ascension Parish School Bd.]]'', 393 F. 3d 608, 615, n. 22 (CA5 2004)</ref> Roberts added: \"but not on these facts\".<ref name=slip5-6/> Roberts reiterated the circumstances, then explained: \"Under these circumstances, we agree with the superintendent that Frederick cannot 'stand in the midst of his fellow students, during school hours, at a school-sanctioned activity and claim he is not at school.'\"<ref name=slip5-6/>\n\n====Principal reasonably interpreted speech====\n\nNext, Roberts determined that the principal's conclusion that Frederick's banner \"advocated the use of illegal drugs\" was reasonable. Acknowledging that the banner's message was \"cryptic\", nevertheless it was undeniably a \"reference to illegal drugs\".<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 402.</ref> In reaching this conclusion, Roberts contrasted \"the paucity of alternative meanings the banner might bear\" against the fact that the two immediately available interpretations of the words support this conclusion:\n{{Quote|First, the phrase could be interpreted as an imperative: \"[Take] bong hits ...\"\u2014a message equivalent, as Morse explained in her declaration, to \"smoke marijuana\" or \"use an illegal drug\". Alternatively, the phrase could be viewed as celebrating drug use\u2014\"bong hits [are a good thing]\", or \"[we take] bong hits\".}}\nAnd even if that second interpretation does not support the principal's conclusions that the banner advocated the use of illegal drugs,\n{{Quote|we discern no meaningful distinction between celebrating illegal drug use in the midst of fellow students and outright advocacy or promotion. See ''[[Guiles v. Marineau]]'', 461 F.3d 320, 328 (CA2 2006) (discussing the present case and describing the sign as \"a clearly pro-drug banner\")}}\nWrapping up this discussion, Roberts rejected the two alternative accounts for Frederick's speech provided in the dissent: first, the dissent noted that Frederick \"just wanted to get on television\", which it characterized as a \"credible and uncontradicted explanation for the message\". Roberts rejoined: \"But that is a description of Frederick's motive for displaying the banner; it is not an interpretation of what the banner says.\" Second, the dissent emphasized the importance of political speech and the need to foster \"national debate about a serious issue\". Roberts rejoined that \"not even Frederick argues that the banner conveys any sort of political or religious message\"; \"this is plainly not a case about political debate over the criminalization of drug use or possession.\"\n\n====First Amendment permits schools to restrict such speech====\nFinally, Roberts inquired whether a principal may restrict such speech. He concluded that she can.<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 403.</ref>\n\nHe began by reviewing the court's [[school speech (First Amendment)|school speech]] jurisprudence:\n* First, Roberts recapitulated that student expression may be suppressed only if school officials reasonably conclude that it will \"materially and substantially disrupt the work and discipline of the school\"\u2014observing however that this doctrine came from a case (''[[Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School Dist.]]'') in which the students were engaging in \"political speech\" in \"a silent, passive expression of opinion, unaccompanied by any disorder or disturbance\" (wearing armbands, to express \"disapproval of the Vietnam hostilities and their advocacy of a truce, to make their views known, and, by their example, to influence others to adopt them\". Id., at 514), and in which \"[t]he only interest the Court discerned underlying the school's actions was the \"mere desire to avoid the discomfort and unpleasantness that always accompany an unpopular viewpoint\", or \"an urgent wish to avoid the controversy which might result from the expression\". Roberts commented on this opinion with a quote from ''[[Virginia v. Black]]''\u2014that political speech is \"at the core of what the First Amendment is designed to protect\". 538 U.S. 343, 365 (2003).\n* Second, Roberts cited ''[[Bethel School Dist. No. 403 v. Fraser]]''. The jurisprudence of ''Fraser'' is controversial, but Roberts declined to apply or resolve the disputed holding of that case (\"We need not resolve this debate to decide this case\"); instead, he explained that \"[f]or present purposes, it is enough to distill from ''Fraser'' two basic principles\":\n::#that \"the constitutional rights of students in public school are not automatically coextensive with the rights of adults in other settings\" (\"in light of the special characteristics of the school environment\").<ref>Here, Roberts cited {{ussc|name=Cohen v. California|volume=403|page=15|pin=|year=1971}}.</ref>\n::#that the \"substantial disruption\" analysis prescribed by Tinker \"is not absolute\" (i.e., it is flexible/optional).<ref>Here, Roberts cited {{ussc|name=Hazelwood School Dist. v. Kuhlmeier|link=Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier|volume=484|page=260}}, 271, n. 4 (1988) (disagreeing with the proposition that there is \"no difference between the First Amendment analysis applied in Tinker and that applied in Fraser\", and noting that the holding in Fraser was not based on any showing of substantial disruption).</ref>\n* Third, Roberts cited the most recent student speech case, ''[[Hazelwood School Dist. v. Kuhlmeier]]''. In that case, the Court permitted a school to \"exercise editorial control over the style and content of student speech in school-sponsored expressive activities\" (declining to publish articles in the school paper that \"the public might reasonably perceive to bear the imprimatur of the school\") \"so long as their actions are reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns\". Roberts found that this case, though factually distinct, was \"nevertheless instructive because it confirms both principles cited above\".\n\nRoberts then cited cases that cited Tinker in the course of interpreting the qualified status that other Constitutional rights acquire in schools\u2014''[[Vernonia School Dist. 47J v. Acton]]'', ''[[New Jersey v. T.&nbsp;L.&nbsp;O.]]'', ''[[Board of Ed. of Independent School Dist. No. 92 of Pottawatomie Cty. v.

It further noted that part of a school's educational mission is \"to educate students about the dangers of illegal drugs and to discourage their use\".<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 398-99.</ref> The District Court also noted \"peer pressure is perhaps 'the single most important factor leading school children to take drugs.'\"<ref name=MvF14>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 408.</ref> The Court's interpretation of Frederick's banner deemed the banner as a type of peer pressure. Based on these concerns, the opinion concluded that the principal's actions were motivated by a \"serious and palpable\" danger of drug abuse quite different from the amorphous fears of anti-war sentiment at play in ''Tinker''.<ref name=MvF14/>\n\nIn ''Tinker'', the school principal had punished students for wearing black anti-war armbands based on his \"undifferentiated fear or apprehension of disturbance\" or \"mere desire to avoid ... discomfort and unpleasantness\".<ref name=MvF14/> Here, however, the concern about student drug abuse \"extends well beyond an abstract desire to avoid controversy\".<ref name=MvF14/> Principal Morse's failure to act against the banner \"would send a powerful message to the students in her charge, including Frederick, about how serious the school was about the dangers of illegal drug use\".<ref name=MvF15>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 410.</ref> The First Amendment, concluded the opinion, \"does not require schools to tolerate at school events student expression that contributes to those dangers\".<ref name=MvF15/>\n\n===Concurrences===\nJustice [[Clarence Thomas]] wrote a concurrence that argued that students in public schools do not have a right to free speech and that ''Tinker'' should be overturned. Thomas wrote, \"In my view, the history of public education suggests that the First Amendment, as originally understood, does not protect student speech in public schools.\"<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 410-11 (Thomas, J., concurring).</ref> He praised [[Hugo Black]]'s dissenting opinion on ''Tinker'' and called it \"prophetic\". Thomas cited the doctrine of ''[[in loco parentis]]'', meaning \"in place of the parent\", in his opinion. He traced the history of public education in America back to its colonial roots. According to Thomas, because originally public schools were intended to substitute for private tutors, public schools could discipline students as they liked and had a far stronger hand in what happened in the classroom. \"In short\", he continues, \"in the earliest public schools, teachers taught, and students listened. Teachers commanded, and students obeyed.\"<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 412 (Thomas, J., concurring).</ref> He opined that because parents entrusted the care of their children to teachers, teachers have a right to act in the place of parents during school hours. Therefore, teachers should be able to discipline students if necessary. Thomas lambasted ''Tinker'' for \"usurping [the local school district as a] traditional authority for the judiciary\".<ref name=Thomas421>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 421 (Thomas, J., concurring).</ref> Thomas believed that Frederick was neither speaking gibberish nor openly advocating drug use, but granting such an impertinence constitutional protection \"would ... be to 'surrender control of the American public school system to public school students.'\"<ref name=Thomas421/>\n\nJustice [[Samuel Alito]], joined by Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]], wrote a concurrence indicating that he agreed with the majority opinion to the extent that:\n\n{{quote|(a) it goes no further than to hold that a public school may restrict speech that a reasonable observer would interpret as advocating illegal drug use and (b) it provides no support for any restriction of speech that can plausibly be interpreted as commenting on any political or social issue, including speech on issues such as \"the wisdom of the war on drugs or of legalizing marijuana for medicinal use\".<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 422 (Alito, J., concurring).</ref>}}\n\nAlito agreed that Morse did not violate Frederick's First Amendment rights and emphasized in his concurrence that the holding only applies to students who advocate illegal drug use. He opposed the \"educational mission\" and ''[[in loco parentis]]'' analysis in favor of a \"special characteristic\" of schools that he identifies to be ensuring the physical safety of the students. Alito concluded that an exception must be made to the First Amendment free speech guarantee to protect the students; since according to Alito, advocating illegal drugs possibly leads to violence. But Alito insisted that this small reduction of what is protected by the First Amendment is \"at the far reaches of what the First Amendment permits\".<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 426 (Alito, J., concurring).</ref>\n\n===Concurrence in part and dissent in part===\nJustice [[Stephen Breyer]] concurred in the judgment in part and dissented in part, arguing that the Court should not have directly answered the First Amendment question in the case, but rather decided it based on [[qualified immunity]]. Qualified immunity is an [[affirmative defense]] that requires courts to enter judgment in favor of a government employee accused of violating individual rights unless the employee's conduct violates \"clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known\".<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 429 (Breyer, J., concurring).</ref> Because it was not clear whether the school principal's actions in taking down the banner violated the First Amendment, Breyer would have simply issued a narrow decision indicating that she was shielded by qualified immunity and gone no further.<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 425-26 (Breyer, J., concurring).</ref>\n\n===Dissent===\nJustice [[John Paul Stevens]], in a dissent joined by Justice [[David Souter|Souter]] and Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg|Ginsburg]], argued that \"the Court does serious violence to the First Amendment in upholding\u2014indeed, lauding\u2014a school's decision to punish Frederick for expressing a view with which it disagreed.\"<ref>''Morse'', 551 U.S. at 435 (Stevens, J., dissenting).</ref> Stevens wrote:\n\n{{quote|... the school's interest in protecting its students from exposure to speech 'reasonably regarded as promoting illegal drug use' ... cannot justify disciplining Frederick for his attempt to make an ambiguous statement to a television audience simply because it contained an oblique reference to drugs.

For example, in Wisniewski, a student was suspended after school officials learned of an instant messenger icon he had created that depicted the shooting of his English teacher. 494 F.3d at 35. In one of the few decisions citing to Morse, the Second Circuit declined to consider whether the true threat doctrine was relevant, and instead applied ''Tinker'''s substantial disruption test. Id. at 38\u201339. The court held that the school did not violate the student's First Amendment rights by suspending him because it was reasonably foreseeable that the icon would come to school officials' attention and cause a disruption at school. Id. at 39\u201340.\n\nFor a discussion of the true threat doctrine's application to student speech, see Andrew P.

Frederick'' Be Applied?\" 12 ''Lewis & Clark Law Review'', 1</ref> noting that Chief Justice Roberts \"sought to keep the decision quite narrow\", limiting the case \"to the issue of public school administrators' ability to keep the educational process free from messages about illegal drugs\" and drawing from the Court's existing student speech jurisprudence that \"permitted school administrators broad discretion to keep out of the educational environment antisocial messages celebrating drug use\".<ref name=lewisclark />\n\n===Erwin Chemerinsky===\nLeading constitutional law scholar [[Erwin Chemerinsky]] participated in the same symposium, exploring how this decision would be understood and applied by school officials, school boards, and lower court judges. He suggested that the opinion was misguided and\u2014from a First Amendment perspective\u2014highly undesirable, arguing that the decision cannot be justified under existing First Amendment principles, that it could be seen as authorizing punishment of students for speech that is deemed distasteful or offensive, even just juvenile. However, he noted Justice Alito's concurring opinion, which suggests that the majority opinion might be exceedingly narrow and based on a very unusual factual context; Chemerinsky noted that if Justice Alito's opinion is seen as defining the scope of the holding, then the case establishes only the power of schools to punish speech encouraging illegal drug use rather than giving school officials great discretion to punish student speech. Thus, despite the fact that ''Morse v. Frederick'' is consistent with decisions from the Supreme Court and lower federal courts over the last two decades, his hope is that Chief Justice Roberts's majority opinion will be read through the prism of Justice Alito's concurring opinion, thereby having little effect on the already very limited First Amendment rights of students.<ref name=lewisclark />\n\n==Subsequent judicial interpretation==\nMelinda Cupps Dickler noted that \"The few courts that have discussed Morse have disagreed about the breadth of its holding,\"<ref name=\"Dickler\">Melinda Cupps Dickler (Visiting Assistant Professor at Chicago-Kent College of Law, Illinois Institute of Technology), \"The Morse Quartet: Student Speech And The First Amendment\", 53 ''Loyola Law Review'', 355. {{doi|10.2139/ssrn.1009601 }}</ref> supporting this claim with the following citations:\n\n::Compare ''Lowery v.

Fulton County Sch. Dist.'', 494 F.3d 978, 9984 (11th Cir. 2007) (holding that Morse's holding is broad). The ''Layshock'' court stated that ''Morse'' did not change the basic framework established by the ''Tinker'' trilogy, which it described as a scheme in which ''Fraser'' and ''Kuhlmeier'' are exceptions to ''Tinker's'' general rule. ''Layshock'', 496 F. Supp. 2d at 596. Significantly, however, the court cited to both ''Morse'' and ''Tinker'' as requiring courts to defer to school officials' decisions about punishing student speech. ''Id''. at 597. On the other hand, the court also accepted Justice Alito's concurring argument in ''Morse'' when it held that ''Morse'' does not permit school officials to regulate student speech merely on the basis that it is incompatible with the schools' educational missions. ''Id''. at 599.\n\n::By contrast, the Eleventh Circuit extended ''Morse's'' rationale about illegal drugs to the context of student speech that is \"construed as a threat of school violence\". ''Boim'', 494 F.3d at 984 (upholding the suspension of a high school student for a story labeled as a \"dream\" in which she described shooting her math teacher). Moreover, the court concluded that Morse supports the idea that student speech can be regulated where \"[in] a school administrator's professional observation ... certain expressions [of student speech] have led to, and therefore could lead to, an unhealthy and potentially unsafe learning environment\". Id. at 983 (quoting ''Scott v. Sch. Bd.'', 324 F.3d 1246, 1247 (11th Cir. 2003)). Some commentators predict that courts will extend Morse to further restrict protection for student speech.

Most types of services fall into two categories: clinical assessment (the patient's functional abilities in his or her environment), and [[medical therapy|clinical therapy]]. Some fields of rehabilitation practice that have explored telerehabilitation are: [[neuropsychology]], [[speech-language pathology]], [[audiology]], [[occupational therapy]], and [[physical therapy]]. Telerehabilitation can deliver therapy to people who cannot travel to a [[clinic]] because the patient has a [[disability]] or because of travel time. Telerehabilitation also allows experts in rehabilitation to engage in a clinical consultation at a distance.\n\nMost telerehabilitation is highly visual. As of 2014, the most commonly used mediums are [[webcam]]s, [[videoconferencing]], [[phone line]]s, [[videophone]]s and webpages containing rich Internet applications. The visual nature of telerehabilitation technology limits the types of rehabilitation services that can be provided. It is most widely used for [[neuropsychological rehabilitation]]; fitting of rehabilitation equipment such as [[wheelchair]]s, [[Brace (orthopaedic)|braces]] or [[artificial limb]]s; and in speech-language pathology. [[Rich internet applications]] for neuropsychological rehabilitation (aka [[cognitive rehabilitation]]) of cognitive impairment (from many etiologies) were first introduced in 2001. This endeavor has expanded as a [[teletherapy]] application for cognitive skills enhancement programs for school children. [[Tele-audiology]] (hearing assessments) is a growing application. Currently, telerehabilitation in the practice of occupational therapy and physical therapy is limited, perhaps because these two disciplines are more \"hands on\".\n\nTwo important areas of telerehabilitation research are (1) demonstrating equivalence of assessment and therapy to in-person assessment and therapy, and (2) building new data collection systems to digitize information that a therapist can use in practice. Ground-breaking research in [[telehaptics]] (the sense of touch) and virtual reality may broaden the scope of telerehabilitation practice, in the future.\n\nIn the United States, the [[National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research]]'s (NIDRR)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/osers/nidrr/index.html?src=mr|title=OSERS|website=www.ed.gov|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031011114426/http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/osers/nidrr/index.html?src=mr|archive-date=2003-10-11}}</ref> supports research and the development of telerehabilitation. NIDRR's grantees include the \"Rehabilitation Engineering and Research Center\" (RERC) at the [[University of Pittsburgh]], the [[Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago]], the State University of New York at Buffalo, and the National Rehabilitation Hospital in Washington DC. Other federal funders of research are the [[Veterans Health Administration]], the Health Services Research Administration in the US Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Defense.<ref>{{cite web| last = Hiers| first = Mary | name-list-format = vanc | title = Everything You Need to Know About Telemedicine| url = http://www.accessrx.com/blog/current-health-news/everything-you-need-to-know-about-telemedicine-m0525/| accessdate = 10 July 2014 }}</ref> Outside the United States, excellent research is conducted in Australia and Europe.\n\nOnly a few health insurers in the United States, and about half of Medicaid programs,<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.apmr.2003.09.008 |pmid=15241772 |title=Medicaid payment for telerehabilitation |journal=Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation |volume=85 |issue=7 |pages=1188\u201391 |year=2004 |last1=Palsbo |first1=Susan E }}</ref> [[reimburse]] for telerehabilitation services.

Examples include:\n\nTelemedicine for trauma triage: using telemedicine, trauma specialists can interact with personnel on the scene of a mass casualty or disaster situation, via the internet using mobile devices, to determine the severity of injuries. They can provide clinical assessments and determine whether those injured must be evacuated for necessary care. Remote trauma specialists can provide the same quality of clinical assessment and plan of care as a trauma specialist located physically with the patient.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Collins | first = Hilton | name-list-format = vanc | title = Advanced First Responder and Medical Capabilities Could Save Lives | journal = Emergency Management | date = 28 August 2008 | url = http://www.emergencymgmt.com/disaster/Advanced-First-Responder-and.html}}</ref>\n\nTelemedicine for [[intensive care unit]] (ICU) rounds: Telemedicine is also being used in some trauma ICUs to reduce the spread of infections. Rounds are usually conducted at hospitals across the country by a team of approximately ten or more people to include attending physicians, fellows, residents and other clinicians. This group usually moves from bed to bed in a unit discussing each patient. This aids in the transition of care for patients from the night shift to the morning shift, but also serves as an educational experience for new residents to the team. A new approach features the team conducting rounds from a conference room using a video-conferencing system. The trauma attending, residents, fellows, nurses, nurse practitioners, and pharmacists are able to watch a live video stream from the patient's bedside. They can see the vital signs on the monitor, view the settings on the respiratory ventilator, and/or view the patient's wounds. Video-conferencing allows the remote viewers two-way communication with clinicians at the bedside.<ref>{{cite web | title = Advanced technologies and wireless telecommunications enhance care and medical training at the Ryder Trauma Center in Miami | publisher = Virtual Medical Worlds | date = 4 December 2008 | url = http://www.hoise.com/vmw/09/articles/vmw/LV-VM-01-09-10.html | accessdate = 23 July 2013}}</ref>\n\nTelemedicine for trauma education: some trauma centers are delivering trauma education lectures to hospitals and health care providers worldwide using video conferencing technology.

[[Willem Einthoven]], the inventor of the ECG, actually did tests with transmission of ECG via telephone lines. This was because the hospital did not allow him to move patients outside the hospital to his laboratory for testing of his new device. In 1906 Einthoven came up with a way to transmit the data from the hospital directly to his lab.<ref>[http://www.medetel.lu/download/2009/parallel_sessions/presentation/day1/telecardiology_and_tele-ecg_network.pdf Telecardiology].</ref>\nSee above reference-General health care delivery. Remotely treating ventricular fibrillation Medphone Corporation, 1989\n\n==== Teletransmission of ECG using methods indigenous to Asia ====\nOne of the oldest known telecardiology systems for teletransmissions of ECGs was established in Gwalior, India in 1975 at GR Medical college by Ajai Shanker, S. Makhija, P.K. Mantri using an indigenous technique for the first time in India.\n\nThis system enabled wireless transmission of ECG from the moving ICU van or the patients home to the central station in ICU of the department of Medicine. Transmission using wireless was done using frequency modulation which eliminated noise. Transmission was also done through telephone lines. The ECG output was connected to the telephone input using a modulator which converted ECG into high frequency sound. At the other end a demodulator reconverted the sound into ECG with a good gain accuracy. The ECG was converted to sound waves with a frequency varying from 500&nbsp;Hz to 2500&nbsp;Hz with 1500&nbsp;Hz at baseline.\n\nThis system was also used to monitor patients with pacemakers in remote areas. The central control unit at the ICU was able to correctly interpret arrhythmia. This technique helped medical aid reach in remote areas.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Shanker A, Makhija S, Mantri PK | title = Teletransmission of ECG Waveform: An Ingenious Low Priced Technique | journal = Indian Heart Journal | year = 1982 | volume = 34 | number = 6}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, [[Stethoscope#Electronic|electronic stethoscopes]] can be used as recording devices, which is helpful for purposes of telecardiology. There are many examples of successful telecardiology services worldwide.\n\nIn [[Pakistan]] three pilot projects in telemedicine was initiated by the Ministry of IT & Telecom, Government of Pakistan (MoIT) through the Electronic Government Directorate in collaboration with Oratier Technologies (a pioneer company within Pakistan dealing with healthcare and HMIS) and PakDataCom (a bandwidth provider). Three hub stations through were linked via the Pak Sat-I communications satellite, and four districts were linked with another hub. A 312 Kb link was also established with remote sites and 1 Mbit/s bandwidth was provided at each hub. Three hubs were established: the Mayo Hospital (the largest hospital in Asia), JPMC Karachi and Holy Family Rawalpindi. These 12 remote sites were connected and on average of 1,500 patients being treated per month per hub. The project was still running smoothly after two years.<ref name=\"83a\">{{cite web|url=http://202.83.164.29/egdsite04/?p=projimpu |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110704102514/http://202.83.164.29/egdsite04/?p=projimpu  |archive-date=2011-07-04 |url-status=dead |title=Electronic Government Directorate &#124; Pakistan telemedicine |accessdate=25 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Telepsychiatry ===\n{{main|Telepsychiatry}}\n\nTelepsychiatry, another aspect of telemedicine, also utilizes [[videoconferencing]] for patients residing in underserved areas to access psychiatric services.

The most typical implementation are two computers connected via the Internet. The computer at the receiving end will need to have a high-quality display screen that has been tested and cleared for clinical purposes. Sometimes the receiving computer will have a printer so that images can be printed for convenience.\n\nThe teleradiology process begins at the image sending station. The radiographic image and a modem or other connection are required for this first step. The image is scanned and then sent via the network connection to the receiving computer.\n\nToday's high-speed broadband based Internet enables the use of new technologies for teleradiology: the image reviewer can now have access to distant servers in order to view an exam. Therefore, they do not need particular workstations to view the images; a standard [[personal computer]] (PC) and [[digital subscriber line]] (DSL) connection is enough to reach keosys central server.

A critical limiting factor is the speed, [[Latency (engineering)|latency]] and reliability of the communication system between the surgeon and the patient, though trans-Atlantic surgeries have been demonstrated.\n\n===Other specialist care delivery===\nTelemedicine can facilitate specialty care delivered by [[primary care physician]]s according to a controlled study of the treatment of [[hepatitis C]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Arora S, Thornton K, Murata G, Deming P, Kalishman S, Dion D, Parish B, Burke T, Pak W, Dunkelberg J, Kistin M, Brown J, Jenkusky S, Komaromy M, Qualls C | display-authors = 6 | title = Outcomes of treatment for hepatitis C virus infection by primary care providers | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 364 | issue = 23 | pages = 2199\u2013207 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21631316 | pmc = 3820419 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa1009370 }}</ref> Various specialties are contributing to telemedicine, in varying degrees.\n\n== Major developments ==\n\n=== In policy ===\nTelehealth is a modern form of health care delivery.

Typically, states with restrictive licensure laws also have several exceptions (varying from state to state) that may release an out-of-state practitioner from the additional burden of obtaining such a license. A number of states require practitioners who seek compensation to frequently deliver interstate care to acquire a full license.\n\nIf a practitioner serves several states, obtaining this license in each state could be an expensive and time-consuming proposition. Even if the practitioner never practices medicine face-to-face with a patient in another state, he/she still must meet a variety of other individual state requirements, including paying substantial licensure fees, passing additional oral and written examinations, and traveling for interviews.\n\nIn 2008, the U.S. passed the Ryan Haight Act which required face-to-face or valid telemedicine consultations prior to receiving a prescription.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.govtech.com/health/Ryan-Haight-Act-will.html|title=Ryan Haight Act will Require Tighter Restrictions on Internet Pharmacies|website=www.govtech.com|accessdate=7 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[:Category:Medical licensing boards in the United States|State medical licensing boards]] have sometimes opposed telemedicine; for example, in 2012 electronic consultations were illegal in Idaho, and an Idaho-licensed general practitioner was punished by the board for prescribing an antibiotic, triggering reviews of her licensure and board certifications across the country.<ref name=\":0b\">{{cite web|url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2015/aug/22/telemedicine-sanction-in-idaho-clouds-doctors/|title=Telemedicine sanction in Idaho clouds doctor's future|website=Spokesman.com|accessdate=7 March 2016}}</ref> Subsequently, in 2015 the state legislature legalized electronic consultations.<ref name=\":0b\" />\n\nIn 2015, Teladoc filed suit against the [[Texas Medical Board]] over a rule that required in-person consultations initially; the judge refused to dismiss the case, noting that antitrust laws apply to state medical boards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20151214/NEWS/151219924|title=Teladoc case against Texas Medical Board will move forward, judge rules|website=Modern Healthcare|accessdate=7 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Major implications and impacts ==\nTelehealth allows multiple, varying disciplines to merge and deliver a potentially more uniform level of care, using technology.

Patients who are home-bound and would otherwise require an ambulance to move them to a clinic are also a consideration.\n\n== Limitations and restrictions ==\nWhile many branches of medicine have wanted to fully embrace telehealth for a long time, there are certain risks and barriers which bar the full amalgamation of telehealth into [[best practice]]. For a start, it is dubious as to whether a practitioner can fully leave the \"hands-on\" experience behind.<ref name=\":15\" /> Although it is predicted that telehealth will replace many consultations and other health interactions, it cannot yet fully replace a physical examination, this is particularly so in [[Medical diagnosis|diagnostics]], [[Physical medicine and rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] or [[mental health]].<ref name=\":15\" />\n\nThe benefits posed by telehealth challenge the normative means of healthcare delivery set in both legislation and practice. Therefore, the growing prominence of telehealth is starting to underscore the need for updated regulations, guidelines and legislation which reflect the current and future trends of healthcare practices.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":15\" /> Telehealth enables timely and flexible care to patients wherever they may be; although this is a benefit, it also poses threats to [[privacy]], [[safety]][[Medical license|, medical licensing]] and [[reimbursement]]. When a clinician and patient are in different locations, it is difficult to determine which laws apply to the context.<ref name=\"pmid24820794\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Keck CS, Doarn CR | title = Telehealth technology applications in speech-language pathology | journal = Telemedicine Journal and E-health | volume = 20 | issue = 7 | pages = 653\u20139 | date = July 2014 | pmid = 24820794 | doi = 10.1089/tmj.2013.0295 }}</ref> Once healthcare crosses borders different state bodies are involved in order to regulate and maintain the level of care that is warranted to the patient or telehealth consumer. As it stands, telehealth is complex with many grey areas when put into practice especially as it crosses borders. This effectively limits the potential benefits of telehealth.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":15\" />\n\nAn example of these limitations include the current American reimbursement infrastructure, where [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] will reimburse for telehealth services only when a patient is living in an area where specialists are in shortage, or in particular rural counties. The area is defined by whether it is a medical facility as opposed to a patient's' home. The site that the practitioner is in, however, is unrestricted. Medicare will only reimburse live video (synchronous) type services, not store-and-forward, mhealth or remote patient monitoring (if it does not involve live-video). Some insurers currently will reimburse telehealth, but not all yet. So providers and patients must go to the extra effort of finding the correct insurers before continuing. Again in America, states generally tend to require that clinicians are licensed to practice in the surgery' state, therefore they can only provide their service if licensed in an area that they do not live in themselves.<ref name=\":0b\" />\n\nMore specific and widely reaching laws, legislations and regulations will have to evolve with the technology. They will have to be fully agreed upon, for example, will all clinicians need full licensing in every community they provide telehealth services too, or could there be a limited use telehealth licence? Would the limited use licence cover all potential telehealth interventions, or only some? Who would be responsible if an emergency was occurring and the practitioner could not provide immediate help \u2013 would someone else have to be in the room with the patient at all consult times? Which state, city or country would the law apply in when a breach or malpractice occurred? <ref name=\":15\" /><ref name=\":19\">Paul DL.

Virtual medical treatment also entails potentially decreased human interaction between medical professionals and patients, an increased risk of error when medical services are delivered in the absence of a registered professional, and an increased risk that [[protected health information]] may be compromised through electronic storage and transmission.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hjelm NM | title = Benefits and drawbacks of telemedicine | journal = Journal of Telemedicine and Telecare | volume = 11 | issue = 2 | pages = 60\u201370 | date = 1 March 2005 | pmid = 15829049 | doi = 10.1258/1357633053499886 }}</ref> There is also a concern that telemedicine may actually decrease time efficiency due to the difficulties of assessing and treating patients through virtual interactions; for example, it has been estimated that a [[teledermatology]] consultation can take up to thirty minutes, whereas fifteen minutes is typical for a traditional consultation.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.rrh.org.au/publishedarticles/article_print_1581.pdf | title = Barriers to the up-take of telemedicine in Australia \u2013 a view from providers | work = The University of Queensland, School of Medicine | author = JJ Moffatt | date = February 2011}}</ref> Additionally, potentially poor quality of transmitted records, such as images or patient progress reports, and decreased access to relevant clinical information are quality assurance risks that can compromise the quality and continuity of patient care for the reporting doctor.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Strehle EM, Shabde N | title = One hundred years of telemedicine: does this new technology have a place in paediatrics? | journal = Archives of Disease in Childhood | volume = 91 | issue = 12 | pages = 956\u20139 | date = December 2006 | pmid = 17119071 | pmc = 2082971 | doi = 10.1136/adc.2006.099622 }}</ref> Other obstacles to the implementation of telemedicine include unclear legal regulation for some telemedical practices and difficulty claiming reimbursement from insurers or government programs in some fields.<ref name=\"Angaran\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Angaran DM | title = Telemedicine and telepharmacy: current status and future implications | journal = American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy | volume = 56 | issue = 14 | pages = 1405\u201326 | date = July 1999 | pmid = 10428449 | doi = 10.1093/ajhp/56.14.1405 }}</ref>\n\nAnother disadvantage of telemedicine is the inability to start treatment immediately. For example, a patient suffering from a bacterial infection might be given an [[antibiotic]] [[hypodermic injection]] in the clinic, and observed for any reaction, before that antibiotic is prescribed in pill form.\n\nWe must also be wary of equitability. Many families and individuals in the United States do not have internet access in their homes. Not to mention they may lack the necessary equipment to access telehealth services, such as a laptop, tablet, or smart phone.\n\n== Ethical issues ==\n{{see also|Informed consent|Medical ethics}}\n\n''[[Informed consent]]'' is another issue \u2013 should the patient give informed consent to receive online care before it starts? Or will it be implied if it is care that can only practically be given over distance? When telehealth includes the possibility for technical problems such as transmission errors or security breaches or storage which impact on ability to communicate, it may be wise to obtain informed consent in person first, as well as having backup options for when technical issues occur. In person, a patient can see who is involved in their care (namely themselves and their clinician in a consult), but online there will be other involved such as the technology providers, therefore consent may need to involve disclosure of anyone involved in the transmission of the information and the security that will keep their information private, and any legal malpractice cases may need to involve all of those involved as opposed to what would usually just be the practitioner.<ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":19\" /><ref name=\":20\" />\n\n== The state of the market ==\nThe rate of adoption of telehealth services in any jurisdiction is frequently influenced by factors such as the adequacy and cost of existing conventional [[health care|health services]] in meeting [[patient|patient needs]]; the policies of governments and/or insurers with respect to coverage and payment for telehealth services; and medical licensing requirements that may inhibit or deter the provision of telehealth second opinions or primary consultations by physicians.\n\nProjections for the growth of the telehealth market are optimistic, and much of this optimism is predicated upon the increasing demand for remote medical care.   According to a recent survey, nearly three-quarters of U.S. consumers say they would use telehealth.<ref name=\"healthdata\">{{cite web|url=http://www.healthdatamanagement.com/news/telemedicine-38701-1.html|title=Survey: Consumers Keen on Telemedicine|access-date=2010-04-26}}</ref>  At present, several major companies along with a bevvy of startups are working to develop a leading presence in the field.\n\nIn the UK, the Government's Care Services minister, Paul Burstow, has stated that telehealth and telecare would be extended over the next five years (2012\u20132017) to reach three million people.\n\n===Companies===\nIn the United States, telemedicine companies are collaborating with health insurers and other telemedicine providers to expand marketshare and patient access to telemedicine consultations.

Through a series of studies, there is growing support in the literature showing that remote videoconference-based administration of many standard neuropsychological tests results in test findings that are similar to traditional in-person evaluations, thereby establishing the basis for the reliability and validity of teleneuropsychological assessment.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wadsworth HE, Dhima K, Womack KB, Hart J, Weiner MF, Hynan LS, Cullum CM | title = Validity of Teleneuropsychological Assessment in Older Patients with Cognitive Disorders | journal = Archives of Clinical Neuropsychology | volume = 33 | issue = 8 | pages = 1040\u20131045 | date = December 2018 | pmid = 29329363 | doi = 10.1093/arclin/acx140 | pmc = 6887729 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wadsworth HE, Galusha-Glasscock JM, Womack KB, Quiceno M, Weiner MF, Hynan LS, Shore J, Cullum CM | display-authors = 6 | title = Remote Neuropsychological Assessment in Rural American Indians with and without Cognitive Impairment | journal = Archives of Clinical Neuropsychology | volume = 31 | issue = 5 | pages = 420\u20135 | date = August 2016 | pmid = 27246957 | pmc = 4954610 | doi = 10.1093/arclin/acw030 }}</ref><ref name=\"auto\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Galusha-Glasscock JM, Horton DK, Weiner MF, Cullum CM | title = Video Teleconference Administration of the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status | journal = Archives of Clinical Neuropsychology | volume = 31 | issue = 1 | pages = 8\u201311 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 26446834 | pmc = 4718188 | doi = 10.1093/arclin/acv058 }}</ref><ref name=\"auto\"/><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Parikh M, Grosch MC, Graham LL, Hynan LS, Weiner M, Shore JH, Cullum CM | title = Consumer acceptability of brief videoconference-based neuropsychological assessment in older individuals with and without cognitive impairment | journal = The Clinical Neuropsychologist | volume = 27 | issue = 5 | pages = 808\u201317 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23607729 | pmc = 3692573 | doi = 10.1080/13854046.2013.791723 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Grosch MC, Gottlieb MC, Cullum CM | title = Initial practice recommendations for teleneuropsychology | journal = The Clinical Neuropsychologist | volume = 25 | issue = 7 | pages = 1119\u201333 | date = October 2011 | pmid = 21951075 | doi = 10.1080/13854046.2011.609840 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Munro Cullum C, Hynan LS, Grosch M, Parikh M, Weiner MF | title = Teleneuropsychology: evidence for video teleconference-based neuropsychological assessment | journal = Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society | volume = 20 | issue = 10 | pages = 1028\u201333 | date = November 2014 | pmid = 25343269 | pmc = 4410096 | doi = 10.1017/S1355617714000873 }}</ref>\n\n=== Telerehabilitation ===\n{{main|Telerehabilitation}}\n\n'''Telerehabilitation''' (or ''e-rehabilitation''<ref name=\"dl-2005\">{{cite book | year = 2005 | title = E-health care information systems: an introduction for students and professionals | publisher = John Wiley and Sons | isbn = 978-0-7879-6618-8 | page = 219}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | url = http://ijahsp.nova.edu/articles/vol2num4/pierce-keaton.htm | title = An E-rehabilitation Team Helps Caregivers Deal with Stroke | publisher = Ijahsp.nova.edu | accessdate = 26 March 2011 | journal = The Internet Journal of Allied Health Sciences and Practice | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | issn = 1540-580X | author1 = Lisa Keaton | author2 = Linda L.

Most types of services fall into two categories: clinical assessment (the patient's functional abilities in his or her environment), and [[medical therapy|clinical therapy]]. Some fields of rehabilitation practice that have explored telerehabilitation are: [[neuropsychology]], [[speech-language pathology]], [[audiology]], [[occupational therapy]], and [[physical therapy]]. Telerehabilitation can deliver therapy to people who cannot travel to a [[clinic]] because the patient has a [[disability]] or because of travel time. Telerehabilitation also allows experts in rehabilitation to engage in a clinical consultation at a distance.\n\nMost telerehabilitation is highly visual. As of 2014, the most commonly used mediums are [[webcam]]s, [[videoconferencing]], [[phone line]]s, [[videophone]]s and webpages containing rich Internet applications. The visual nature of telerehabilitation technology limits the types of rehabilitation services that can be provided. It is most widely used for [[neuropsychological rehabilitation]]; fitting of rehabilitation equipment such as [[wheelchair]]s, [[Brace (orthopaedic)|braces]] or [[artificial limb]]s; and in speech-language pathology. [[Rich internet applications]] for neuropsychological rehabilitation (aka [[cognitive rehabilitation]]) of cognitive impairment (from many etiologies) were first introduced in 2001. This endeavor has expanded as a [[teletherapy]] application for cognitive skills enhancement programs for school children. [[Tele-audiology]] (hearing assessments) is a growing application. Currently, telerehabilitation in the practice of occupational therapy and physical therapy is limited, perhaps because these two disciplines are more \"hands on\".\n\nTwo important areas of telerehabilitation research are (1) demonstrating equivalence of assessment and therapy to in-person assessment and therapy, and (2) building new data collection systems to digitize information that a therapist can use in practice. Ground-breaking research in [[telehaptics]] (the sense of touch) and virtual reality may broaden the scope of telerehabilitation practice, in the future.\n\nIn the United States, the [[National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research]]'s (NIDRR)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/osers/nidrr/index.html?src=mr|title=OSERS|website=www.ed.gov|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031011114426/http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/osers/nidrr/index.html?src=mr|archive-date=2003-10-11}}</ref> supports research and the development of telerehabilitation. NIDRR's grantees include the \"Rehabilitation Engineering and Research Center\" (RERC) at the [[University of Pittsburgh]], the [[Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago]], the State University of New York at Buffalo, and the National Rehabilitation Hospital in Washington DC. Other federal funders of research are the [[Veterans Health Administration]], the Health Services Research Administration in the US Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Defense.<ref>{{cite web| last = Hiers| first = Mary | name-list-format = vanc | title = Everything You Need to Know About Telemedicine| url = http://www.accessrx.com/blog/current-health-news/everything-you-need-to-know-about-telemedicine-m0525/| accessdate = 10 July 2014 }}</ref> Outside the United States, excellent research is conducted in Australia and Europe.\n\nOnly a few health insurers in the United States, and about half of Medicaid programs,<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.apmr.2003.09.008 |pmid=15241772 |title=Medicaid payment for telerehabilitation |journal=Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation |volume=85 |issue=7 |pages=1188\u201391 |year=2004 |last1=Palsbo |first1=Susan E }}</ref> [[reimburse]] for telerehabilitation services.

Examples include:\n\nTelemedicine for trauma triage: using telemedicine, trauma specialists can interact with personnel on the scene of a mass casualty or disaster situation, via the internet using mobile devices, to determine the severity of injuries. They can provide clinical assessments and determine whether those injured must be evacuated for necessary care. Remote trauma specialists can provide the same quality of clinical assessment and plan of care as a trauma specialist located physically with the patient.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Collins | first = Hilton | name-list-format = vanc | title = Advanced First Responder and Medical Capabilities Could Save Lives | journal = Emergency Management | date = 28 August 2008 | url = http://www.emergencymgmt.com/disaster/Advanced-First-Responder-and.html}}</ref>\n\nTelemedicine for [[intensive care unit]] (ICU) rounds: Telemedicine is also being used in some trauma ICUs to reduce the spread of infections. Rounds are usually conducted at hospitals across the country by a team of approximately ten or more people to include attending physicians, fellows, residents and other clinicians. This group usually moves from bed to bed in a unit discussing each patient. This aids in the transition of care for patients from the night shift to the morning shift, but also serves as an educational experience for new residents to the team. A new approach features the team conducting rounds from a conference room using a video-conferencing system. The trauma attending, residents, fellows, nurses, nurse practitioners, and pharmacists are able to watch a live video stream from the patient's bedside. They can see the vital signs on the monitor, view the settings on the respiratory ventilator, and/or view the patient's wounds. Video-conferencing allows the remote viewers two-way communication with clinicians at the bedside.<ref>{{cite web | title = Advanced technologies and wireless telecommunications enhance care and medical training at the Ryder Trauma Center in Miami | publisher = Virtual Medical Worlds | date = 4 December 2008 | url = http://www.hoise.com/vmw/09/articles/vmw/LV-VM-01-09-10.html | accessdate = 23 July 2013}}</ref>\n\nTelemedicine for trauma education: some trauma centers are delivering trauma education lectures to hospitals and health care providers worldwide using video conferencing technology.

This capability allows the attending to view the residents in real time. The remote surgeon has the capability to control the camera (pan, tilt and zoom) to get the best angle of the procedure while at the same time providing expertise in order to provide the best possible care to the patient.<ref>{{cite news | last = Gonzalez | first = Diana | name-list-format = vanc | title = UM Doctors Use Telemedicine to Continue Care In Iraq | publisher =  | date = 10 November 2011 | url = http://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/UM-Doctors-Use-Tele-133650778.html | accessdate = 23 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Telecardiology ===\nECGs, or [[Electrocardiography|electrocardiographs]], can be transmitted using telephone and wireless. [[Willem Einthoven]], the inventor of the ECG, actually did tests with transmission of ECG via telephone lines. This was because the hospital did not allow him to move patients outside the hospital to his laboratory for testing of his new device. In 1906 Einthoven came up with a way to transmit the data from the hospital directly to his lab.<ref>[http://www.medetel.lu/download/2009/parallel_sessions/presentation/day1/telecardiology_and_tele-ecg_network.pdf Telecardiology].</ref>\nSee above reference-General health care delivery. Remotely treating ventricular fibrillation Medphone Corporation, 1989\n\n==== Teletransmission of ECG using methods indigenous to Asia ====\nOne of the oldest known telecardiology systems for teletransmissions of ECGs was established in Gwalior, India in 1975 at GR Medical college by Ajai Shanker, S. Makhija, P.K. Mantri using an indigenous technique for the first time in India.\n\nThis system enabled wireless transmission of ECG from the moving ICU van or the patients home to the central station in ICU of the department of Medicine. Transmission using wireless was done using frequency modulation which eliminated noise. Transmission was also done through telephone lines. The ECG output was connected to the telephone input using a modulator which converted ECG into high frequency sound. At the other end a demodulator reconverted the sound into ECG with a good gain accuracy. The ECG was converted to sound waves with a frequency varying from 500&nbsp;Hz to 2500&nbsp;Hz with 1500&nbsp;Hz at baseline.\n\nThis system was also used to monitor patients with pacemakers in remote areas. The central control unit at the ICU was able to correctly interpret arrhythmia. This technique helped medical aid reach in remote areas.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Shanker A, Makhija S, Mantri PK | title = Teletransmission of ECG Waveform: An Ingenious Low Priced Technique | journal = Indian Heart Journal | year = 1982 | volume = 34 | number = 6}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, [[Stethoscope#Electronic|electronic stethoscopes]] can be used as recording devices, which is helpful for purposes of telecardiology. There are many examples of successful telecardiology services worldwide.\n\nIn [[Pakistan]] three pilot projects in telemedicine was initiated by the Ministry of IT & Telecom, Government of Pakistan (MoIT) through the Electronic Government Directorate in collaboration with Oratier Technologies (a pioneer company within Pakistan dealing with healthcare and HMIS) and PakDataCom (a bandwidth provider). Three hub stations through were linked via the Pak Sat-I communications satellite, and four districts were linked with another hub. A 312 Kb link was also established with remote sites and 1 Mbit/s bandwidth was provided at each hub. Three hubs were established: the Mayo Hospital (the largest hospital in Asia), JPMC Karachi and Holy Family Rawalpindi. These 12 remote sites were connected and on average of 1,500 patients being treated per month per hub. The project was still running smoothly after two years.<ref name=\"83a\">{{cite web|url=http://202.83.164.29/egdsite04/?p=projimpu |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110704102514/http://202.83.164.29/egdsite04/?p=projimpu  |archive-date=2011-07-04 |url-status=dead |title=Electronic Government Directorate &#124; Pakistan telemedicine |accessdate=25 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Telepsychiatry ===\n{{main|Telepsychiatry}}\n\nTelepsychiatry, another aspect of telemedicine, also utilizes [[videoconferencing]] for patients residing in underserved areas to access psychiatric services. It offers wide range of services to the patients and providers, such as consultation between the psychiatrists, educational clinical programs, diagnosis and assessment, medication therapy management, and routine follow-up meetings.<ref>{{cite news | last = Hoffman | first = Jan | name-list-format = vanc | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/25/fashion/therapists-are-seeing-patients-online.html?_r=1 | title = When Your Therapist Is Only a Click Away | newspaper = [[New York Times]] | date = 25 September 2011 | page = ST1}}</ref> Most telepsychiatry is undertaken in real time (synchronous) although in recent years research at UC Davis has developed and validated the process of asynchronous telepsychiatry.<ref>{{Citation|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8_5hCF2q6I|accessdate = 2015-11-14|title= Telepsychiatry Research by Peter Yellowlees}}</ref> Recent reviews of the literature by Hilty et al. in 2013, and by Yellowlees et al. in 2015 confirmed that telepsychiatry is as effective as in-person psychiatric consultations for diagnostic assessment, is at least as good for the treatment of disorders such as depression and post traumatic stress disorder, and may be better than in-person treatment in some groups of patients, notably children, veterans and individuals with agoraphobia.\n\nAs of 2011, the following are some of the model programs and projects which are deploying telepsychiatry in rural areas in the United States:\n# [[University of Colorado Denver#University of Colorado Health Sciences Center|University of Colorado Health Sciences Center]] (UCHSC) supports two programs for American Indian and Alaskan Native populations\n::a.

In the United States, Skype, Gchat, Yahoo, and MSN are not permitted to conduct video-conferencing services unless these companies sign a Business Associate Agreement stating that their employees are HIPAA trained. For this reason, most companies provide their own specialized videotelephony services. Violating HIPAA in the United States can result in penalties of hundreds of thousands of dollars.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.hipaajournal.com/what-are-the-penalties-for-hipaa-violations-7096/|title=What are the Penalties for HIPAA Violations?|date=2015-06-24|work=HIPAA Journal|access-date=2017-03-02}}</ref>\n\nThe momentum of telemental health and telepsychiatry is growing.

The most typical implementation are two computers connected via the Internet. The computer at the receiving end will need to have a high-quality display screen that has been tested and cleared for clinical purposes. Sometimes the receiving computer will have a printer so that images can be printed for convenience.\n\nThe teleradiology process begins at the image sending station. The radiographic image and a modem or other connection are required for this first step. The image is scanned and then sent via the network connection to the receiving computer.\n\nToday's high-speed broadband based Internet enables the use of new technologies for teleradiology: the image reviewer can now have access to distant servers in order to view an exam. Therefore, they do not need particular workstations to view the images; a standard [[personal computer]] (PC) and [[digital subscriber line]] (DSL) connection is enough to reach keosys central server.

It is a form of [[telepresence]]. Remote surgery combines elements of [[robot]]ics, cutting edge [[telecommunication|communication technology]] such as high-speed data connections, [[telehaptics|haptics]] and elements of [[management information system]]s. While the field of [[robotic surgery]] is fairly well established, most of these robots are controlled by surgeons at the location of the surgery.\n\nRemote surgery is essentially advanced [[telecommuting]] for surgeons, where the physical distance between the surgeon and the patient is immaterial. It promises to allow the expertise of specialized surgeons to be available to patients worldwide, without the need for patients to travel beyond their local hospital.<ref>[http://www.intersurgtech.com/media.html IST's Media Collection], Interface Surgical Technologies website. Retrieved 21 August 2011.</ref>\n\n[[Remote surgery]] or telesurgery is performance of surgical procedures where the surgeon is not physically in the same location as the patient, using a robotic [[teleoperator]] system controlled by the surgeon. The remote operator may give tactile feedback to the user. Remote surgery combines elements of robotics and high-speed data connections. A critical limiting factor is the speed, [[Latency (engineering)|latency]] and reliability of the communication system between the surgeon and the patient, though trans-Atlantic surgeries have been demonstrated.\n\n===Other specialist care delivery===\nTelemedicine can facilitate specialty care delivered by [[primary care physician]]s according to a controlled study of the treatment of [[hepatitis C]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Arora S, Thornton K, Murata G, Deming P, Kalishman S, Dion D, Parish B, Burke T, Pak W, Dunkelberg J, Kistin M, Brown J, Jenkusky S, Komaromy M, Qualls C | display-authors = 6 | title = Outcomes of treatment for hepatitis C virus infection by primary care providers | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 364 | issue = 23 | pages = 2199\u2013207 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21631316 | pmc = 3820419 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa1009370 }}</ref> Various specialties are contributing to telemedicine, in varying degrees.\n\n== Major developments ==\n\n=== In policy ===\nTelehealth is a modern form of health care delivery.

Typically, states with restrictive licensure laws also have several exceptions (varying from state to state) that may release an out-of-state practitioner from the additional burden of obtaining such a license. A number of states require practitioners who seek compensation to frequently deliver interstate care to acquire a full license.\n\nIf a practitioner serves several states, obtaining this license in each state could be an expensive and time-consuming proposition. Even if the practitioner never practices medicine face-to-face with a patient in another state, he/she still must meet a variety of other individual state requirements, including paying substantial licensure fees, passing additional oral and written examinations, and traveling for interviews.\n\nIn 2008, the U.S. passed the Ryan Haight Act which required face-to-face or valid telemedicine consultations prior to receiving a prescription.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.govtech.com/health/Ryan-Haight-Act-will.html|title=Ryan Haight Act will Require Tighter Restrictions on Internet Pharmacies|website=www.govtech.com|accessdate=7 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[:Category:Medical licensing boards in the United States|State medical licensing boards]] have sometimes opposed telemedicine; for example, in 2012 electronic consultations were illegal in Idaho, and an Idaho-licensed general practitioner was punished by the board for prescribing an antibiotic, triggering reviews of her licensure and board certifications across the country.<ref name=\":0b\">{{cite web|url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2015/aug/22/telemedicine-sanction-in-idaho-clouds-doctors/|title=Telemedicine sanction in Idaho clouds doctor's future|website=Spokesman.com|accessdate=7 March 2016}}</ref> Subsequently, in 2015 the state legislature legalized electronic consultations.<ref name=\":0b\" />\n\nIn 2015, Teladoc filed suit against the [[Texas Medical Board]] over a rule that required in-person consultations initially; the judge refused to dismiss the case, noting that antitrust laws apply to state medical boards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20151214/NEWS/151219924|title=Teladoc case against Texas Medical Board will move forward, judge rules|website=Modern Healthcare|accessdate=7 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Major implications and impacts ==\nTelehealth allows multiple, varying disciplines to merge and deliver a potentially more uniform level of care, using technology.

This is particularly an issue where [[MRSA]] is a concern. Additionally, some patients who feel uncomfortable in a doctors office may do better remotely. For example, [[white coat syndrome]] may be avoided. Patients who are home-bound and would otherwise require an ambulance to move them to a clinic are also a consideration.\n\n== Limitations and restrictions ==\nWhile many branches of medicine have wanted to fully embrace telehealth for a long time, there are certain risks and barriers which bar the full amalgamation of telehealth into [[best practice]]. For a start, it is dubious as to whether a practitioner can fully leave the \"hands-on\" experience behind.<ref name=\":15\" /> Although it is predicted that telehealth will replace many consultations and other health interactions, it cannot yet fully replace a physical examination, this is particularly so in [[Medical diagnosis|diagnostics]], [[Physical medicine and rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] or [[mental health]].<ref name=\":15\" />\n\nThe benefits posed by telehealth challenge the normative means of healthcare delivery set in both legislation and practice. Therefore, the growing prominence of telehealth is starting to underscore the need for updated regulations, guidelines and legislation which reflect the current and future trends of healthcare practices.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":15\" /> Telehealth enables timely and flexible care to patients wherever they may be; although this is a benefit, it also poses threats to [[privacy]], [[safety]][[Medical license|, medical licensing]] and [[reimbursement]]. When a clinician and patient are in different locations, it is difficult to determine which laws apply to the context.<ref name=\"pmid24820794\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Keck CS, Doarn CR | title = Telehealth technology applications in speech-language pathology | journal = Telemedicine Journal and E-health | volume = 20 | issue = 7 | pages = 653\u20139 | date = July 2014 | pmid = 24820794 | doi = 10.1089/tmj.2013.0295 }}</ref> Once healthcare crosses borders different state bodies are involved in order to regulate and maintain the level of care that is warranted to the patient or telehealth consumer. As it stands, telehealth is complex with many grey areas when put into practice especially as it crosses borders. This effectively limits the potential benefits of telehealth.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":15\" />\n\nAn example of these limitations include the current American reimbursement infrastructure, where [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] will reimburse for telehealth services only when a patient is living in an area where specialists are in shortage, or in particular rural counties. The area is defined by whether it is a medical facility as opposed to a patient's' home. The site that the practitioner is in, however, is unrestricted. Medicare will only reimburse live video (synchronous) type services, not store-and-forward, mhealth or remote patient monitoring (if it does not involve live-video). Some insurers currently will reimburse telehealth, but not all yet. So providers and patients must go to the extra effort of finding the correct insurers before continuing. Again in America, states generally tend to require that clinicians are licensed to practice in the surgery' state, therefore they can only provide their service if licensed in an area that they do not live in themselves.<ref name=\":0b\" />\n\nMore specific and widely reaching laws, legislations and regulations will have to evolve with the technology. They will have to be fully agreed upon, for example, will all clinicians need full licensing in every community they provide telehealth services too, or could there be a limited use telehealth licence? Would the limited use licence cover all potential telehealth interventions, or only some? Who would be responsible if an emergency was occurring and the practitioner could not provide immediate help \u2013 would someone else have to be in the room with the patient at all consult times? Which state, city or country would the law apply in when a breach or malpractice occurred? <ref name=\":15\" /><ref name=\":19\">Paul DL. Collaborative activities in virtual settings: A knowledge management perspective of telemedicine. J Manage Inf Syst 2006;22(4):143-176.</ref>\n\nA major legal action prompt in telehealth thus far has been issues surrounding online prescribing and whether an appropriate clinician-patient relationship can be established online to make prescribing safe, making this an area that requires particular scrutiny.<ref name=\":14\" /> It may be required that the practitioner and patient involved must meet in person at least once before online prescribing can occur, or that at least a live-video conference must occur, not just impersonal questionnaires or surveys to determine need.<ref name=\":20\">{{cite book | vauthors = Cascella LM | title = Virtual Risk: An Overview of Telehealth From a Risk Management Perspective | date = 2016 }}</ref>\n\nThe downsides of telemedicine include the cost of telecommunication and data management equipment and of technical training for medical personnel who will employ it. Virtual medical treatment also entails potentially decreased human interaction between medical professionals and patients, an increased risk of error when medical services are delivered in the absence of a registered professional, and an increased risk that [[protected health information]] may be compromised through electronic storage and transmission.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hjelm NM | title = Benefits and drawbacks of telemedicine | journal = Journal of Telemedicine and Telecare | volume = 11 | issue = 2 | pages = 60\u201370 | date = 1 March 2005 | pmid = 15829049 | doi = 10.1258/1357633053499886 }}</ref> There is also a concern that telemedicine may actually decrease time efficiency due to the difficulties of assessing and treating patients through virtual interactions; for example, it has been estimated that a [[teledermatology]] consultation can take up to thirty minutes, whereas fifteen minutes is typical for a traditional consultation.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.rrh.org.au/publishedarticles/article_print_1581.pdf | title = Barriers to the up-take of telemedicine in Australia \u2013 a view from providers | work = The University of Queensland, School of Medicine | author = JJ Moffatt | date = February 2011}}</ref> Additionally, potentially poor quality of transmitted records, such as images or patient progress reports, and decreased access to relevant clinical information are quality assurance risks that can compromise the quality and continuity of patient care for the reporting doctor.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Strehle EM, Shabde N | title = One hundred years of telemedicine: does this new technology have a place in paediatrics? | journal = Archives of Disease in Childhood | volume = 91 | issue = 12 | pages = 956\u20139 | date = December 2006 | pmid = 17119071 | pmc = 2082971 | doi = 10.1136/adc.2006.099622 }}</ref> Other obstacles to the implementation of telemedicine include unclear legal regulation for some telemedical practices and difficulty claiming reimbursement from insurers or government programs in some fields.<ref name=\"Angaran\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Angaran DM | title = Telemedicine and telepharmacy: current status and future implications | journal = American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy | volume = 56 | issue = 14 | pages = 1405\u201326 | date = July 1999 | pmid = 10428449 | doi = 10.1093/ajhp/56.14.1405 }}</ref>\n\nAnother disadvantage of telemedicine is the inability to start treatment immediately. For example, a patient suffering from a bacterial infection might be given an [[antibiotic]] [[hypodermic injection]] in the clinic, and observed for any reaction, before that antibiotic is prescribed in pill form.\n\nWe must also be wary of equitability. Many families and individuals in the United States do not have internet access in their homes. Not to mention they may lack the necessary equipment to access telehealth services, such as a laptop, tablet, or smart phone.\n\n== Ethical issues ==\n{{see also|Informed consent|Medical ethics}}\n\n''[[Informed consent]]'' is another issue \u2013 should the patient give informed consent to receive online care before it starts? Or will it be implied if it is care that can only practically be given over distance? When telehealth includes the possibility for technical problems such as transmission errors or security breaches or storage which impact on ability to communicate, it may be wise to obtain informed consent in person first, as well as having backup options for when technical issues occur. In person, a patient can see who is involved in their care (namely themselves and their clinician in a consult), but online there will be other involved such as the technology providers, therefore consent may need to involve disclosure of anyone involved in the transmission of the information and the security that will keep their information private, and any legal malpractice cases may need to involve all of those involved as opposed to what would usually just be the practitioner.<ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":19\" /><ref name=\":20\" />\n\n== The state of the market ==\nThe rate of adoption of telehealth services in any jurisdiction is frequently influenced by factors such as the adequacy and cost of existing conventional [[health care|health services]] in meeting [[patient|patient needs]]; the policies of governments and/or insurers with respect to coverage and payment for telehealth services; and medical licensing requirements that may inhibit or deter the provision of telehealth second opinions or primary consultations by physicians.\n\nProjections for the growth of the telehealth market are optimistic, and much of this optimism is predicated upon the increasing demand for remote medical care.   According to a recent survey, nearly three-quarters of U.S. consumers say they would use telehealth.<ref name=\"healthdata\">{{cite web|url=http://www.healthdatamanagement.com/news/telemedicine-38701-1.html|title=Survey: Consumers Keen on Telemedicine|access-date=2010-04-26}}</ref>  At present, several major companies along with a bevvy of startups are working to develop a leading presence in the field.\n\nIn the UK, the Government's Care Services minister, Paul Burstow, has stated that telehealth and telecare would be extended over the next five years (2012\u20132017) to reach three million people.\n\n===Companies===\nIn the United States, telemedicine companies are collaborating with health insurers and other telemedicine providers to expand marketshare and patient access to telemedicine consultations.

In such cases, the [[political system]] and [[machinery of government]] is not specifically structured to pursue the development of socialism. Socialist states in the Marxist\u2013Leninist sense are sovereign states under the control of a [[vanguard party]] which is organizing the country's economic, political and social development toward the realization of socialism.

The Soviet Union proclaimed itself a socialist state and proclaimed its commitment to building a [[socialist economy]] in its [[1936 Constitution of the Soviet Union|1936 constitution]] and a subsequent [[1977 Constitution of the Soviet Union|1977 constitution]]. It was governed by the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] as a single-party state ostensibly with a [[democratic centralism]] organization, with [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]] remaining its [[Ideology of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|official guiding ideology]] until the [[Soviet Union dissolution|Soviet Union's dissolution]] on 26 December 1991. The political systems of these Marxist\u2013Leninist socialist states revolve around the central role of the party which holds ultimate authority. Internally, the [[communist party]] practices a form of democracy called [[democratic centralism]].<ref name=\"Furtak, Robert K. 1986\"/> During the [[22nd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] in 1961, [[Nikita Khrushchev]] announced the completion of socialist construction and declared the optimistic goal of achieving [[Communism in 20 years|communism in twenty years]]. The [[Eastern Bloc]] was a political and economic bloc of [[Soviet satellite states|Soviet-aligned socialist states]] in Eastern and Central Europe which adhered to Marxism\u2013Leninism, Soviet-style [[Soviet Bloc politics|governance]] and [[Soviet-type economic planning|command economy]].\n\nThe [[People's Republic of China]] was founded on 1 October 1949 and proclaims itself to be a socialist state in its [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China|1982 constitution]]. The [[Democratic People's Republic of Korea]] (North Korea) used to be a [[Marxist\u2013Leninist state]]. In 1972, the country adopted a new [[Constitution of North Korea|constitution]] which changed the official state ideology to ''[[Juche]]'' which is held to be a distinct Korean re-interpretation of the former ideology.<ref name=\"freemediaproductions.info\">{{cite web|url=http://www.freemediaproductions.info/Editorials/2009/08/30/juche-is-third-position-ideology-built-on-marx-not-marxist-leninism/|title=Juche is Third Position ideology built on Marx \u2013 Not Marxist-Leninism|publisher=Free Media Productions \u2013 Editorials|date=30 August 2009|accessdate=25 December 2015}}</ref> Similarly, direct references to [[communism]] in the [[Lao People's Democratic Republic]] are not included in its [[Constitution of Laos|founding documents]], although it gives direct power to the governing ruling party, the Marxist\u2013Leninist [[Lao People's Revolutionary Party]]. The preamble to the [[Constitution of Vietnam|constitution]] of the [[Socialist Republic of Vietnam]] states that Vietnam only entered a transition stage between [[capitalism]] and [[socialism]] after the country was [[Vietnamese reunification|re-unified]] under the [[Communist Party of Vietnam]] in 1976.<ref>[http://www.vietnamembassy-usa.org/learn_about_vietnam/politics/constitution/ \"VN Embassy \u2013 Constitution of 1992\"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709162321/http://www.vietnamembassy-usa.org/learn_about_vietnam/politics/constitution/|date=9 July 2011}} From the Preamble: \"On 2 July 1976, the National Assembly of reunified Vietnam decided to change the country's name to the Socialist Republic of Vietnam; the country entered a period of transition to socialism, strove for national construction, and unyieldingly defended its frontiers while fulfilling its internationalist duty.\"</ref>\n\nThe [[Constitution of Cuba|1992 constitution]] of the [[Republic of Cuba]] states that the role of the [[Communist Party of Cuba]] is to \"guide the common effort toward the goals and construction of socialism (and the progress toward a communist society)\".<ref>[http://www.cubanet.org/ref/dis/const_92_e.htm \"Constitution of the Republic of Cuba, 1992\"].

In most cases, these are constitutional references to the building of a socialist society and political principles that have little to no bearing on the structure and guidance of these country's [[machinery of government]] and [[economic system]]. The preamble to the 1976 [[Constitution of Portugal]] states that the Portuguese state has as one of its goals opening \"the way to socialist society\".<ref>The [http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/po00000_.html \"Preamble to the 1976 Constitution of Portugal\"] stated: \"The Constituent Assembly affirms the Portuguese people's decision to defend their national independence, safeguard the fundamental rights of citizens, establish the basic principles of democracy, secure the primacy of the rule of law in a democratic state, and open the way to socialist society.\"</ref> [[Algeria]], the [[Republic of the Congo|Congo]], [[India]] and [[Sri Lanka]] have directly used the term socialist in their official constitution and name. [[Croatia]], [[Hungary]] and [[Poland]] directly denounce \"Communism\" in their founding documents in reference to their past regimes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/hr00000_.html|title=Croatia Constitution|last=Tschentscher|first=Axel|website=Servat.unibe.ch|accessdate=27 December 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/hu__indx.html|title=Hungary Index|last=Tschentscher|first=Axel|website=Servat.unibe.ch|accessdate=27 December 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/pl00000_.html|title=Poland - Constitution|last=Tschentscher|first=Axel|website=Servat.unibe.ch|accessdate=27 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn these cases, the intended meaning of socialism can vary widely and sometimes the constitutional references to socialism are left over from a previous period in the country's history. In the case of many Middle Eastern states, the term socialism was often used in reference to an [[Arab socialism|Arab socialist]]/[[Arab nationalism|nationalist]] philosophy adopted by specific regimes such as that of [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] and that of the various [[Ba'ath parties]]. Examples of countries directly using the term socialist in their names include the [[Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka]] and the [[Socialist Republic of Vietnam]] while a number of countries make references to socialism in their constitutions, but not in their names. These include India<ref>The Preamble of the Constitution of India reads: \"We, the people of India, having solemnly resolved to constitute India into a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic, republic [...]\". See [[Preamble to the Constitution of India]].</ref> and [[Portugal]]. In addition, countries like [[Belarus]], [[Colombia]], [[France]], [[Russia]] and [[Spain]] use the varied term social state, leaving a more ambiguous meaning. In the constitutions of Croatia, Hungary and Poland, direct condemnation is made to the respective past socialist regimes. The [[autonomous region]] of [[Rojava]] which operates under the principles of [[democratic confederalism]] has been described as a socialist state.<ref>{{cite news|last=Wall|first=Derek|url=http://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/a-fe30-Rojava-a-beacon-of-hope-fighting-Isis|title=Rojava: a beacon of hope fighting Isis|newspaper=Morning Star|date=25 August 2014|accessdate=25 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105163107/http://morningstaronline.co.uk/a-fe30-Rojava-a-beacon-of-hope-fighting-Isis|archive-date=5 January 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Other uses ===\n{{social democracy sidebar}}\nDuring the [[post-war consensus]], [[nationalization]] of large industries was relatively widespread and it was not uncommon for commentators to describe some European countries as democratic socialist states seeking to move their countries toward a [[socialist economy]].<ref name=\"Dissident 1991\">Heilbroner, Robert L.

Marxists trace the formation of the contemporary form of the [[sovereign state]] to the emergence of capitalism as a dominant mode of production, with its organizational precepts and functions designed specifically to manage and regulate the affairs of a capitalist economy. Because this involves governance and laws passed in the interest of the [[bourgeoisie]] as a whole and because government officials either come from the bourgeoisie or are dependent upon their interests, Marx characterized the [[capitalist state]] as a [[dictatorship of the bourgeoisie]]. Extrapolating from this, Marx described a post-revolutionary government on the part of the working class or proletariat as a [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] because the economic interests of the proletariat would have to guide state affairs and policy during a transitional state. Alluding further to the establishment of a socialist and communist economy where [[social ownership]] displaces [[private ownership]], and thus class distinctions on the basis of private property ownership are eliminated, the modern state would have no function and would gradually \"wither away\" or be transformed into a new form of governance.<ref>{{cite book|language=de|last=Engels|first=Friedrich|title=Die Marx-Engels-Gesamtausgabe|series=Karl Marx-Friedrich Engels: Welke|volume=20|editor=Institut f\u00fcr Marxismus-Leninismus bein ZK der SED|publisher=Dietz Verlag|location=Berlin|year=1962}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|language=de|last=Engels|first=Friedrich|title=Die Marx-Engels-Gesamtausgabe|series=Karl Marx-Friedrich Engels: Welke|volume=21|editor=Institut f\u00fcr Marxismus-Leninismus bein ZK der SED|publisher=Dietz Verlag|location=Berlin|year=1962}}</ref>\n\nInfluenced by the pre-Marxist [[utopian socialist]] philosopher [[Henri de Saint-Simon]], [[Friedrich Engels]] theorized the nature of the state would change during the transition to socialism.

New Jersey: Humanities Press.</ref> Following Marx, [[revolutionary socialists]] instead take the view that the working class grows stronger through its battle for reforms (such as in Marx's time the ten-hours bill). In 1848, Marx and Engels wrote: {{quote|Now and then the workers are victorious, but only for a time. The real fruit of their battles lies, not in the immediate result, but in the ever expanding union of the workers. [...] [I]t ever rises up again, stronger, firmer, mightier.

Retrieved 30 December 2019.</ref>}}\n\nAccording to the [[orthodox Marxist]] conception, these battles eventually reach a point where a revolutionary movement arises. A revolutionary movement is required in the view of Marxists to sweep away the capitalist state and the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie which must be abolished and replaced with a dictatorship of the proletariat in order to begin constructing a socialist society. In this view, only through revolution can a socialist state be established as written in ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'': {{quote|In depicting the most general phases of the development of the proletariat, we traced the more or less veiled civil war, raging within existing society, up to the point where that war breaks out into open revolution, and where the violent overthrow of the bourgeoisie lays the foundation for the sway of the proletariat.|Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels|''The Communist Manifesto''<ref name=\"auto\"/>}}\n\n=== Leninist theory of the state ===\n{{main|Leninism}}\nWhereas Marx, Engels and [[classical Marxist]] thinkers had little to say about the organization of the state in a socialist society, presuming the modern state to be specific to the capitalist mode of production, [[Vladimir Lenin]] pioneered the idea of a revolutionary state based on his theory of the revolutionary [[vanguard party]] and organizational principles of [[democratic centralism]]. Adapted to the conditions of semi-feudal Russia, Lenin's concept of the dictatorship of the proletariat involved a revolutionary vanguard party acting as representatives of the proletariat and its interests. According to Lenin's [[April Theses]], the goal of the revolution and vanguard party is not the introduction of socialism (it could only be established on a worldwide scale), but to bring production and the state under the control of the [[Soviet (council)|soviets]] of workers' deputies. Following the [[October Revolution]] in Russia, the [[Bolsheviks]] consolidated their power and sought to control and direct the social and economic affairs of the state and broader Russian society in order to safeguard against counterrevolutionary insurrection, foreign invasion and to promote socialist consciousness among the Russian population while simultaneously promoting economic development.<ref name=\"marxists1989\"/>\n\nThese ideas were adopted by Lenin in 1917 just prior to the October Revolution in Russia and published in ''[[The State and Revolution]]''. With the failure of the worldwide revolution, or at least European revolution, envisaged by Lenin and [[Leon Trotsky]], the [[Russian Civil War]] and finally Lenin's death, war measures that were deemed to be temporary such as forced requisition of food and the lack of democratic control became permanent and a tool to boost [[Joseph Stalin]]'s power, leading to the emergence of Marxism\u2013Leninism and [[Stalinism]] as well as the notion that [[Socialism in one country|socialism can be created and exist in a single state]].\n\nLenin argued that as socialism is replaced by communism, the state would \"[[Withering away of the state|wither away]]\"<ref>Lenin, Vladimir (1917).

He regarded this structural paradox as the necessary preparation for and antithesis of the desired [[workers' state]] which he forecast would follow.\n\n=== Trotskyist theory of the state ===\n{{main|Trotskyism}}\nFollowing Stalin's consolidation of power in the [[Soviet Union]] and static centralization of political power, Trotsky condemned the Soviet government's policies for lacking widespread democratic participation on the part of the population and for suppressing [[Workers' self-management|workers' democratic participation]] in the management of the economy. Because these authoritarian political measures were inconsistent with the organizational precepts of socialism, Trotsky characterized the Soviet Union as a deformed workers' state that would not be able to effectively transition to socialism. Ostensibly socialist states where democracy is lacking, yet the economy is largely in the hands of the state, are termed by [[Orthodox Trotskyism|orthodox Trotskyist]] theories as [[Degenerated workers' state|degenerated]] or [[Deformed workers' state|deformed]] workers' states and not socialist states.<ref>Trotsky, Leon (1935).

They use the term [[state socialism]] in contrast with their own form of socialism which involves either [[collective ownership]] (in the form of [[worker cooperative]]s) or [[common ownership]] of the [[means of production]] without [[Central planning|centralized state planning]]. Those libertarian socialists believe there is no need for a state in a socialist system because there would be no class to suppress and no need for an institution based on coercion and therefore regard the state being a remnant of capitalism.<ref name=\"Schumpeter\"/> Most also hold that [[statism]] is itself antithetical to true socialism, the goal of which is the eyes of libertarian socialists such as [[William Morris]], who wrote as follows in a ''Commonweal'' article: \"State Socialism? \u2014 I don't agree with it; in fact I think the two words contradict one another, and that it is the business of Socialism to destroy the State and put Free Society in its place\".<ref>William Morris (17 May 1890).

Libertarian communists, including [[Anarcho-communism|anarchists]], [[Council communism|councillists]], [[Left communism|leftists]] and [[Libertarian Marxism|Marxists]], also reject the concept of a socialist state for being antithetical to socialism, but they believe that socialism and communism can only be established through [[revolution]] and dissolving the existence of the state.

Marxists trace the formation of the contemporary form of the [[sovereign state]] to the emergence of capitalism as a dominant mode of production, with its organizational precepts and functions designed specifically to manage and regulate the affairs of a capitalist economy. Because this involves governance and laws passed in the interest of the [[bourgeoisie]] as a whole and because government officials either come from the bourgeoisie or are dependent upon their interests, Marx characterized the [[capitalist state]] as a [[dictatorship of the bourgeoisie]]. Extrapolating from this, Marx described a post-revolutionary government on the part of the working class or proletariat as a [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] because the economic interests of the proletariat would have to guide state affairs and policy during a transitional state. Alluding further to the establishment of a socialist and communist economy where [[social ownership]] displaces [[private ownership]], and thus class distinctions on the basis of private property ownership are eliminated, the modern state would have no function and would gradually \"wither away\" or be transformed into a new form of governance.<ref>{{cite book|language=de|last=Engels|first=Friedrich|title=Die Marx-Engels-Gesamtausgabe|series=Karl Marx-Friedrich Engels: Welke|volume=20|editor=Institut f\u00fcr Marxismus-Leninismus bein ZK der SED|publisher=Dietz Verlag|location=Berlin|year=1962}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|language=de|last=Engels|first=Friedrich|title=Die Marx-Engels-Gesamtausgabe|series=Karl Marx-Friedrich Engels: Welke|volume=21|editor=Institut f\u00fcr Marxismus-Leninismus bein ZK der SED|publisher=Dietz Verlag|location=Berlin|year=1962}}</ref>\n\nInfluenced by the pre-Marxist [[utopian socialist]] philosopher [[Henri de Saint-Simon]], [[Friedrich Engels]] theorized the nature of the state would change during the transition to socialism.

Bernstein stated: \"The socialist movement is everything to me while what people commonly call the goal of Socialism is nothing\".<ref>[[Manfred Steger|Steger, Manfred]] (1996). ''Selected Writings Of Eduard Bernstein, 1920\u20131921''. New Jersey: Humanities Press.</ref> Following Marx, [[revolutionary socialists]] instead take the view that the working class grows stronger through its battle for reforms (such as in Marx's time the ten-hours bill). In 1848, Marx and Engels wrote: {{quote|Now and then the workers are victorious, but only for a time. The real fruit of their battles lies, not in the immediate result, but in the ever expanding union of the workers. [...] [I]t ever rises up again, stronger, firmer, mightier.

Retrieved 30 December 2019.</ref>}}\n\nAccording to the [[orthodox Marxist]] conception, these battles eventually reach a point where a revolutionary movement arises. A revolutionary movement is required in the view of Marxists to sweep away the capitalist state and the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie which must be abolished and replaced with a dictatorship of the proletariat in order to begin constructing a socialist society. In this view, only through revolution can a socialist state be established as written in ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'': {{quote|In depicting the most general phases of the development of the proletariat, we traced the more or less veiled civil war, raging within existing society, up to the point where that war breaks out into open revolution, and where the violent overthrow of the bourgeoisie lays the foundation for the sway of the proletariat.|Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels|''The Communist Manifesto''<ref name=\"auto\"/>}}\n\n=== Leninist theory of the state ===\n{{main|Leninism}}\nWhereas Marx, Engels and [[classical Marxist]] thinkers had little to say about the organization of the state in a socialist society, presuming the modern state to be specific to the capitalist mode of production, [[Vladimir Lenin]] pioneered the idea of a revolutionary state based on his theory of the revolutionary [[vanguard party]] and organizational principles of [[democratic centralism]]. Adapted to the conditions of semi-feudal Russia, Lenin's concept of the dictatorship of the proletariat involved a revolutionary vanguard party acting as representatives of the proletariat and its interests. According to Lenin's [[April Theses]], the goal of the revolution and vanguard party is not the introduction of socialism (it could only be established on a worldwide scale), but to bring production and the state under the control of the [[Soviet (council)|soviets]] of workers' deputies. Following the [[October Revolution]] in Russia, the [[Bolsheviks]] consolidated their power and sought to control and direct the social and economic affairs of the state and broader Russian society in order to safeguard against counterrevolutionary insurrection, foreign invasion and to promote socialist consciousness among the Russian population while simultaneously promoting economic development.<ref name=\"marxists1989\"/>\n\nThese ideas were adopted by Lenin in 1917 just prior to the October Revolution in Russia and published in ''[[The State and Revolution]]''. With the failure of the worldwide revolution, or at least European revolution, envisaged by Lenin and [[Leon Trotsky]], the [[Russian Civil War]] and finally Lenin's death, war measures that were deemed to be temporary such as forced requisition of food and the lack of democratic control became permanent and a tool to boost [[Joseph Stalin]]'s power, leading to the emergence of Marxism\u2013Leninism and [[Stalinism]] as well as the notion that [[Socialism in one country|socialism can be created and exist in a single state]].\n\nLenin argued that as socialism is replaced by communism, the state would \"[[Withering away of the state|wither away]]\"<ref>Lenin, Vladimir (1917). ''[[The State and Revolution]]''. p. 70. cf. \"Chapter V, The economic basis for the withering away of the state\".</ref> as strong centralized control progressively reduces as local communities gain more empowerment. As he put succinctly, \"[s]o long as the state exists there is no freedom. When there will be freedom, there will be no state\".<ref>Freeden, Michael; Sargent, Lyman Tower; Stears, Marc, eds.

Oxford: Oxford University Press. p. 371. {{ISBN|9780199585977}}.</ref> In this way, Lenin was thereby proposing a classically dynamic view of progressive social structure which during his own short period of governance emerged as a defensive and preliminary bureaucratic centralist stage. He regarded this structural paradox as the necessary preparation for and antithesis of the desired [[workers' state]] which he forecast would follow.\n\n=== Trotskyist theory of the state ===\n{{main|Trotskyism}}\nFollowing Stalin's consolidation of power in the [[Soviet Union]] and static centralization of political power, Trotsky condemned the Soviet government's policies for lacking widespread democratic participation on the part of the population and for suppressing [[Workers' self-management|workers' democratic participation]] in the management of the economy. Because these authoritarian political measures were inconsistent with the organizational precepts of socialism, Trotsky characterized the Soviet Union as a deformed workers' state that would not be able to effectively transition to socialism. Ostensibly socialist states where democracy is lacking, yet the economy is largely in the hands of the state, are termed by [[Orthodox Trotskyism|orthodox Trotskyist]] theories as [[Degenerated workers' state|degenerated]] or [[Deformed workers' state|deformed]] workers' states and not socialist states.<ref>Trotsky, Leon (1935).

'''2''' (4): 116\u2013122. \"Trotsky argues that the Soviet Union was, at that time, a \"deformed workers' state\" or degenerated workers' state, and not a socialist republic or state, because the \"bureaucracy wrested the power from the hands of mass organizations,\" thereby necessitating only political revolution rather than a completely new social revolution, for workers' political control (i.e. state democracy) to be reclaimed. He argued that it remained, at base, a workers' state because the capitalists and landlords had been expropriated\".

They use the term [[state socialism]] in contrast with their own form of socialism which involves either [[collective ownership]] (in the form of [[worker cooperative]]s) or [[common ownership]] of the [[means of production]] without [[Central planning|centralized state planning]]. Those libertarian socialists believe there is no need for a state in a socialist system because there would be no class to suppress and no need for an institution based on coercion and therefore regard the state being a remnant of capitalism.<ref name=\"Schumpeter\"/> Most also hold that [[statism]] is itself antithetical to true socialism, the goal of which is the eyes of libertarian socialists such as [[William Morris]], who wrote as follows in a ''Commonweal'' article: \"State Socialism? \u2014 I don't agree with it; in fact I think the two words contradict one another, and that it is the business of Socialism to destroy the State and put Free Society in its place\".<ref>William Morris (17 May 1890).

The trough structure is 7&nbsp;ft in height, with a width of 7.5&nbsp;ft.

In some jurisdictions (countries, states, provinces or regions), a [[sign language]] is an official language, whereas in others it has a protected status in certain areas such as education. Governments sometimes stipulate in their constitutions or laws that 'sign language' is recognised or protected, but they fail to specify ''which'' sign language exactly, as there may be several different sign languages in common use within its borders, which has led to problems.\n\nExtending legal recognition is one of the major concerns of the international [[Deaf community]], however, symbolic recognition is no guarantee for an effective improvement of the life of sign language users, and it has been argued that sign languages should be recognized and supported not merely as an accommodation for the disabled, but as the communication medium of language communities.<ref>Sarah C.
