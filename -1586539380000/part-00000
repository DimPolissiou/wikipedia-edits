Both male and female birds have black bills and dark legs, however adults have dimorphic plumage. During the breeding season, males have a black horizontal head bar, two incomplete dark breast-bands on each side of their breast, black ear coverts and a rufous nape and crown (although there is some variation between breeding populations), whereas the females are paler in these areas, without the dark markings.<ref name=\"e\">Arg\u00fcelles-Tic\u00f3, A., K\u00fcpper, C., Kelsh, R.N., Kosztol\u00e1nyi, A., Sz\u00e9kely, T. and van Dijk, R.E. 2015.

Moreover, males have longer [[Bird anatomy|tarsi]] and longer flank feathers than females.<ref name=\"f\" /><ref>Kis, J. and Sz\u00e9kely, T. 2003.

O. and Walsberg, G. E. 2000. The role of plumage in heat transfer processes of birds. American Zoologist, 40, 575-584</ref>\nThere are multiple significant predictors of plumage ornamentation in Kentish plovers. Firstly, the interaction between the advancement of the breeding season and rainfall seem to affect ornamentation. Male ornaments become more elaborated over the course of a breeding season in regions with high rainfall, whereas in regions with low rainfall, male ornaments become lighter. Secondly, the interaction between the breeding system and the sex can predict the degree of plumage ornamentation. In [[polygamous]] populations, the sexual ornaments are more pronounced, generating a stronger sexual dimorphism than in [[monogamous]] populations. The difference is especially witnessed in males, whereby the ornaments are darker and smaller in polygamous populations compared to monogamous populations, where males have lighter and larger ornaments. This is thought to be the result of a trade-off between the size and intensity of the ornaments.<ref name=\"e\" /><ref>Hill, G.E. 1993.

They are known to reside and breed in multiple types of habitat, from [[desert]] with ground temperatures reaching 50&nbsp;\u00b0C to [[tundra]]. The distribution of this species\u2019 breeding areas covers Europe, Asia and Africa,<ref name=\"b\" /><ref name=vin>Vincze, O., Sz\u00e9kely, T., K\u00fcpper, C., AlRashidi, M., Amat, J.A. et al. 2013. Local Environment but Not Genetic Differentiation Influences Biparental Care in Ten Plover Populations. PLoS ONE 8(4</ref>). In Europe, populations are typically found in the west; although there was once a breeding population in [[Hungary]], Kentish plovers no longer breed there. In Africa, populations are found on the southern coast of Senegal and along the Northern coast of the [[Mediterranean]], and the [[Red Sea]] coast. The breeding area continues along the [[Arabian Peninsula]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Qatar]], and [[Bahrain]] in the [[Middle East]]. Small populations can be found on islands too, such as the Cape Verde archipelago, the [[Canary Islands]], and the [[Azores]]. Some populations do not migrate, such as the Maio (Cape Verde) population, however other populations can migrate reasonable distances, for example, plovers that spend winter in North Africa have been known to migrate to [[Turkey]] and [[Greece]] in the spring. Some birds breeding in western Europe are not known to travel very far, just within Europe, however some do travel, mainly to Western Africa.<ref>Meininger, P., Sz\u00e9kely, T., and Scott, D. 2009. Kentish Plover Charadrius alexandrinus. In: Delaney, S., Scott, D. A., Dodman, T., Stroud, D. A. An atlas of wader populations in Africa and Eurasia. Wetlands International, pp 229-235.</ref>\n\n===Habitats and Movement===\n\nThe breeding habitats are most commonly alkali lake shores, [[wetlands]], [[salt marshes]], and coastland, which is fitting with the results of a study that investigated what makes an environment suitable for a breeding habitat for the Kentish plover. By analysing 4 variables of all known nests, the study found that plovers prefer to nest in areas of low elevation, low vegetation, high moisture and places far away from human activity and settlements,.<ref name=\"c\" /><ref name=vin/>\n[[File:KP nest.jpg|thumb|Kentish Plover nest]] \nThere have been observations of parents moving their chicks from poor food areas to better food areas, with chicks subsequently growing stronger in the high food areas. This suggests that parents strategically move their chicks and change habitats. Moving young has benefits: protection from predators, obtaining more food, avoiding competition for food and space, avoiding potential [[infanticide]] due to competition, and avoiding [[territory]] defences from others. However, this is a trade-off as there are also costs to moving young: moving expends a lot of energy, especially in young, therefore chick growth may be stunted as energy is used on movement rather than growth, the chance of mortality due to starvation or predation increases whilst moving through open areas and the area of high food may have a lot of predators in it already. Overall, chick growth and brood survival benefit from moving to a higher food area, therefore increasing reproductive success of parents, hence why the parents move their chicks. The study also found that the larger and heavier females were more likely to move chicks, perhaps because they could defend their chicks from neighbouring parents <ref>Kosztol\u00e1nyi, A., Sz\u00e9kely, T. and Cuthill, I.C. 2007.

It is known that breeding pairs return to breed with each other the following year, however mate changes have also been observed both between and within breeding seasons.<ref>Fraga, R.M. and Amat, J.A. 1996. Breeding biology of a Kentish Plover (Charadrius alexandrinus) population in an inland saline lake. Available at: http://www.ardeola.org/files/319.pdf</ref><ref name=\"g\">Sz\u00e9kely, T. and Lessells, C. M. 1993. Mate change by Kentish Plovers Charadrius alexandrinus. Ornis Scand.2 4: 317-322</ref>\n\nAlong with mate changes, EPF's ([[extra pair fertilisations]]) are also witnessed in some populations, by females copulating with extra-pair males (EPP- extra pair paternity), or males copulating with extra pair females, who then lay their eggs in the male's nest (QP- quasi-parasitism). A theory as to why such EPC's occur is that this mechanism evolved to avoid the deleterious effects of [[inbreeding]]. This is supported by a study by Blomqvist et al.,<ref>Blomqvist, D., Andersson, M., K\u00fcpper, C., Cuthill, I.C., Kis, J., Lanctot, R.B., Sandercock, B.K., Sz\u00e9kely, T., Wallander, J. and Kempenaers, B. 2002. Genetic similarity between mates and extra-pair parentage in three species of shorebirds, Nature. 419(6907), pp. 613\u2013615</ref> showing that EPC's are more common when a breeding pair are more closely related to each other. Another theory is that females may seek out EPC's with high quality males to get the \u2018good genes\u2019 for their sons, following the \u2018[[sexy sons]]\u2019 hypothesis. The breeding season of Kentish plovers lasts on average between 2 and 5 months and varies in the time of year dependent on the particular population. Breeding pairs can replace failed clutches more than once per breeding season, with the same or a different mate, and both males and females can parent more than one brood, due to mate change and EPC's as mentioned above.<ref name=\"a\" /> The [[courtship]] displays also vary between populations of plovers, especially between socially monogamous and polygamous populations, for example in polygamous populations the time spent courting is significantly higher for both males and females than in monogamous populations. Courtship displays include active gestures such as flat running, building nest scrapes (small shallow cavities in the ground that are later built into nests), and fighting/running to defend a breeding territory (mainly by males) <ref>Carmona-Isunza, M.C., K\u00fcpper, C., Serrano-Meneses, M.A. and Sz\u00e9kely, T. 2015. Courtship behavior differs between monogamous and polygamous plovers, Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology. 69(12), pp. 2035\u20132042\n</ref>\n\n===Territories===\n\nKentish plovers inhabit sandy areas or salt-marshes in close proximity to water. Inland populations can be found near alkaline or saline lakes, ponds or reservoirs. The populations inhabiting the coastal regions can be found in semi-desert habitats i.e. on barren beaches, near lagoons and sand extractions on beaches or dunes.\n\n[[File:Salina do porto ingles.jpg|thumb|Salina do Porto Ingles, the habitat of Kentish Plovers in Maio, Cape Verde]]\n\nKentish plovers are territorial shorebirds; the male usually has a [[territory]] and attracts females with courtship displays. The parents are actively defending their nest territories from predators by chasing, fighting or posturing them. When approached by predators in close proximity to the nest, the Kentish plovers quickly run away from the nest and start doing distraction displays to focus the predator's attention on themselves and lure them away from the nest. These displays include calling or crawling on the ground flapping their wings. Males tend to be more aggressive than females. When a plover's territory has been invaded, it invades a neighboring family's territory. This is when fights between males frequently occur because the plovers see their broods threatened. During such fights, it occurs that chicks get injured or even killed.<ref>Kosztol\u00e1nyi & Sz\u00e9kely, pers. obs.</ref> When approached by a predator, chicks usually try to find a spot where they can hide, crouch down and stay motionless to remain unseen. When they are older, they try to run away with their parents.\n\n===Nesting and Incubation===\n[[File:Kentish Plover nest.jpg|left|thumb|A Kentish Plover nest, with a standard grey card]]\nKentish plovers either nest solitarily or in a loose [[semicolonial]] manner. They are ground-nesting birds that lay their eggs in small shallow scrapes prepared by the male during courtship on the bare ground. Selection of the breeding ground is essential for the survival of nests and broods; nests are placed near the water on bare earth or in sparse vegetation; often on slightly elevated sites in order to have a good view of the surroundings to spot predators from a distance or near small bushes, plants or grass clusters,<ref>Snow, D.W. and Perrins, C.M. 1998. The Birds of the Western Palearctic, Volume 1: Non-Passerines. Oxford University Press, Oxford</ref> where the eggs are partly sheltered from predators. Nests are filled with nest material i.e. pebble stones, small parts of shells, fish bones, small twigs, grass and other debris.<ref name=\"d\" /> The modal [[clutch size]] comprises three eggs, although some nests are already completed with one or two eggs. In fresh or incomplete nests, the eggs tend to be fully exposed, but as the incubation period progresses, the amount of nest material increases and the eggs become practically completely covered.<ref name=\"a\" /> During the incubation period, the Kentish plover recesses for variable periods of time mainly to forage or to perform other activities essential for self-maintenance. To compensate for the resulting lack of presence and increased predation risk, they use nest materials to cover and hence camouflage the eggs and keep them insulated.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1163/1568539x-00003008| hdl=10261/89099| title=Dual function of egg-covering in the Kentish plover Charadrius alexandrinus| year=2012| last1=Masero| first1=Jos\u00e9 A.| last2=Monsa| first2=Roc\u00edo| last3=Amat| first3=Juan A.| journal=Behaviour| volume=149| issue=8| pages=881\u2013895}}</ref> Kentish plovers regulate the amount of nest material actively. This was shown experimentally in a study by increasing or decreasing the amount of nest material artificially.

Using a transponder system to monitor incubation routines of snowy plovers. J. Field Ornithol. (in press)</ref> Female Kentish plovers usually lose mass during the day, which is unexpected since they get relieved by the males for a variable amount of time. The loss would be much higher if the females were to incubate alone. This loss is a cost of incubation due to the depletion of fat stores and the evaporation of water.<ref>Szentirmai, I., Kosztol\u00e1nyi, A. and Sz\u00e9kely, T. 2001. Daily changes in body mass of incubating Kentish Plovers. Ornis Hung. 11: 27-32</ref>\n\n==Parental Care==\n[[File:Kentish Plover Chick.jpg|thumb|A Kentish Plover Chick]]\nParental care is variable within birds and the Kentish plover has a slightly different mechanism to other shorebirds. As discussed above, both parents incubate the eggs, however both parents do not always stick around once the eggs have hatched. It is not unusual for one parent to leave the chicks after a variable amount of time; this is referred to as [[brood desertion]]. Brood desertion is the \u2018termination of care, by either one or both parents, before the offspring are capable of surviving independently\u2019 <ref>Fujioka, M. 1989. Mate and nestling desertion in colonial little egrets. Auk 106:292-302</ref> and usually occurs after one week of the brood being accompanied by both parents. Brood desertion has been observed in both males and females, however females desert the brood significantly more frequently than males.<ref name=\"g\" /> \nStudies have shown that both the male and female Kentish plover can provide adequate care for their brood on their own, so it is not the differences in the ability of the parents that determines which parent deserts the brood and which stays to care for the chicks. However, studies have also shown that after desertion females have a larger chance of breeding success than males, potentially due to many Kentish plover populations maintaining a male-biased OSR (operational sex ratio - the ratio of males actively breeding to females). Therefore, is it hypothesized that the amount of reproductive success gained by desertion is what actually determines who deserts the brood,.<ref>Cuthill, I., Sz\u00e9kely, T., McNamara, J. and Houston, A. 2002. Why do birds get divorced? NERC News Spring: 6-7</ref><ref name=\"f\" /> In short, males and females can care for their brood equally, however females gain more by deserting their brood than males, resulting in a higher amount of female desertion over male. The non-deserting parent can continue to brood their chicks up to 80% of the time for over 20 days after hatching, as precocial young are vulnerable and exposed to external temperatures.\n\n==Calls==\nThe alarm call, referred to as ''{{not a typo|kittup}}'' call, is often heard both on the ground and in the air and can occur on its own, or paired with a ''tweet'', heard as ''{{not a typo|too-eet}}''.

It is not near the threshold for \u2018Vulnerable\u2019 under the population size (<10,000 mature individuals with a constant decline reaching >10% within the next 10 years or three generations), since the global population is estimated being very large with 100,000 - 499,999 mature individuals. A closer estimate, needing further verification, is that the population size lies between 290,000 and 460,000 individuals. Moreover, the Kentish plover does not reach the threshold for being \u2018Vulnerable\u2019 on a level of range size (the area of occurrence being <20,000km2 in combination with a decline of population size, habitat area/quality or range size) because it is distributed over an area of 70,800,000 km2. Finally, although there is a decline in global population size, it does not reach the threshold for \u2018Vulnerable\u2019 in terms of population trend meaning >30% decline over 10 years or three generations.<ref name=\"i\">BirdLife International. 2017.

Human activity such as tourists walking through protected areas, pollution, unsustainable harvesting and urbanisation can destroy nesting sites. Plover populations can also be affected by rural human activity, for example fishermen walking through protected plover breeding sites, bringing large numbers of dogs with them- a known predator of plover eggs. Natural predators are also a problem, as many of these predators appear to thrive unnaturally well in the presence of plover breeding grounds, such as the brown-necked raven (Corvus ruficollis) in Maio, Cape Verde, the White-tailed Mongoose (Ichneumia albicauda) in Saudi Arabia, and the Grey Monitors (Varanus griseus) in [[Al-Wathba Wetland Reserve]]. It is thought that the high amount of prey available to these predators attracts them into the breeding grounds- an effect named the 'honey pot',<ref>AlRashidi, M., Kosztol\u00e1nyi, A., Shobrak, M. and Sz\u00e9kely, T. 2011.

During the breeding season, males have a black horizontal head bar, two incomplete dark breast-bands on each side of their breast, black ear coverts and a rufous nape and crown (although there is some variation between breeding populations), whereas the females are paler in these areas, without the dark markings.<ref name=\"e\">Arg\u00fcelles-Tic\u00f3, A., K\u00fcpper, C., Kelsh, R.N., Kosztol\u00e1nyi, A., Sz\u00e9kely, T. and van Dijk, R.E. 2015.

Moreover, males have longer [[Bird anatomy|tarsi]] and longer flank feathers than females.<ref name=\"f\" /><ref>Kis, J. and Sz\u00e9kely, T. 2003.

O. and Walsberg, G. E. 2000. The role of plumage in heat transfer processes of birds. American Zoologist, 40, 575-584</ref>\nThere are multiple significant predictors of plumage ornamentation in Kentish plovers. Firstly, the interaction between the advancement of the breeding season and rainfall seem to affect ornamentation. Male ornaments become more elaborated over the course of a breeding season in regions with high rainfall, whereas in regions with low rainfall, male ornaments become lighter. Secondly, the interaction between the breeding system and the sex can predict the degree of plumage ornamentation. In [[polygamous]] populations, the sexual ornaments are more pronounced, generating a stronger sexual dimorphism than in [[monogamous]] populations. The difference is especially witnessed in males, whereby the ornaments are darker and smaller in polygamous populations compared to monogamous populations, where males have lighter and larger ornaments. This is thought to be the result of a trade-off between the size and intensity of the ornaments.<ref name=\"e\" /><ref>Hill, G.E. 1993.

They are known to reside and breed in multiple types of habitat, from [[desert]] with ground temperatures reaching 50&nbsp;\u00b0C to [[tundra]]. The distribution of this species\u2019 breeding areas covers Europe, Asia and Africa,<ref name=\"b\" /><ref name=vin>Vincze, O., Sz\u00e9kely, T., K\u00fcpper, C., AlRashidi, M., Amat, J.A. et al. 2013. Local Environment but Not Genetic Differentiation Influences Biparental Care in Ten Plover Populations. PLoS ONE 8(4</ref>). In Europe, populations are typically found in the west, however there was once a breeding population in [[Hungary]], however Kentish plovers no longer breed there. In Africa, populations are found on the southern coast of Senegal and along the Northern coast of the [[Mediterranean]], and the [[Red Sea]] coast. The breeding area continues along the [[Arabian Peninsula]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Qatar]], and [[Bahrain]] in the [[Middle East]]. Small populations can be found on islands too, such as the Cape Verde archipelago, the [[Canary Islands]], and the [[Azores]]. Some populations do not migrate, such as the Maio (Cape Verde) population, however other populations can migrate reasonable distances, for example, plovers that spend winter in North Africa have been known to migrate to [[Turkey]] and [[Greece]] in the spring. Some birds breeding in western Europe are not known to travel very far, just within Europe, however some do travel, mainly to Western Africa.<ref>Meininger, P., Sz\u00e9kely, T., and Scott, D. 2009.

Wetlands International, pp 229-235.</ref>\n\n===Habitats and Movement===\n\nThe breeding habitats are most commonly alkali lake shores, [[wetlands]], [[salt marshes]], and coastland, which is fitting with the results of a study that investigated what makes an environment suitable for a breeding habitat for the Kentish plover. By analysing 4 variables of all known nests, the study found that plovers prefer to nest in areas of low elevation, low vegetation, high moisture and places far away from human activity and settlements,.<ref name=\"c\" /><ref name=vin/>\n[[File:KP nest.jpg|thumb|Kentish Plover nest]] \nThere have been observations of parents moving their chicks from poor food areas to better food areas, with chicks subsequently growing stronger in the high food areas. This suggests that parents strategically move their chicks and change habitats. Moving young has benefits: protection from predators, obtaining more food, avoiding competition for food and space, avoiding potential [[infanticide]] due to competition, and avoiding [[territory]] defences from others. However, this is a trade-off as there are also costs to moving young: moving expends a lot of energy, especially in young, therefore chick growth may be stunted as energy is used on movement rather than growth, the chance of mortality due to starvation or predation increases whilst moving through open areas and the area of high food may have a lot of predators in it already. Overall, chick growth and brood survival benefit from moving to a higher food area, therefore increasing reproductive success of parents, hence why the parents move their chicks. The study also found that the larger and heavier females were more likely to move chicks, perhaps because they could defend their chicks from neighbouring parents <ref>Kosztol\u00e1nyi, A., Sz\u00e9kely, T. and Cuthill, I.C. 2007.

It is known that breeding pairs return to breed with each other the following year, however mate changes have also been observed both between and within breeding seasons.<ref>Fraga, R.M. and Amat, J.A. 1996.

Ornis Scand.2 4: 317-322</ref>\n\nAlong with mate changes, EPF's ([[extra pair fertilisations]]) are also witnessed in some populations, by females copulating with extra-pair males (EPP- extra pair paternity), or males copulating with extra pair females, who then lay their eggs in the male's nest (QP- quasi-parasitism). A theory as to why such EPC's occur is that this mechanism evolved to avoid the deleterious effects of [[inbreeding]]. This is supported by a study by Blomqvist et al.,<ref>Blomqvist, D., Andersson, M., K\u00fcpper, C., Cuthill, I.C., Kis, J., Lanctot, R.B., Sandercock, B.K., Sz\u00e9kely, T., Wallander, J. and Kempenaers, B. 2002. Genetic similarity between mates and extra-pair parentage in three species of shorebirds, Nature. 419(6907), pp. 613\u2013615</ref> showing that EPC's are more common when a breeding pair are more closely related to each other. Another theory is that females may seek out EPC's with high quality males to get the \u2018good genes\u2019 for their sons, following the \u2018[[sexy sons]]\u2019 hypothesis. The breeding season of Kentish plovers lasts on average between 2 and 5 months and varies in the time of year dependent on the particular population. Breeding pairs can replace failed clutches more than once per breeding season, with the same or a different mate, and both males and females can parent more than one brood, due to mate change and EPC's as mentioned above.<ref name=\"a\" /> The [[courtship]] displays also vary between populations of plovers, especially between socially monogamous and polygamous populations, for example in polygamous populations the time spent courting is significantly higher for both males and females than in monogamous populations. Courtship displays include active gestures such as flat running, building nest scrapes (small shallow cavities in the ground that are later built into nests), and fighting/running to defend a breeding territory (mainly by males) <ref>Carmona-Isunza, M.C., K\u00fcpper, C., Serrano-Meneses, M.A. and Sz\u00e9kely, T. 2015. Courtship behavior differs between monogamous and polygamous plovers, Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology. 69(12), pp. 2035\u20132042\n</ref>\n\n===Territories===\n\nKentish plovers inhabit sandy areas or salt-marshes in close proximity to water. Inland populations can be found near alkaline or saline lakes, ponds or reservoirs. The populations inhabiting the coastal regions can be found in semi-desert habitats i.e. on barren beaches, near lagoons and sand extractions on beaches or dunes.\n\n[[File:Salina do porto ingles.jpg|thumb|Salina do Porto Ingles, the habitat of Kentish Plovers in Maio, Cape Verde]]\n\nKentish plovers are territorial shorebirds; the male usually has a [[territory]] and attracts females with courtship displays. The parents are actively defending their nest territories from predators by chasing, fighting or posturing them. When approached by predators in close proximity to the nest, the Kentish plovers quickly run away from the nest and start doing distraction displays to focus the predator's attention on themselves and lure them away from the nest. These displays include calling or crawling on the ground flapping their wings. Males tend to be more aggressive than females. When a plover's territory has been invaded, it invades a neighboring family's territory. This is when fights between males frequently occur because the plovers see their broods threatened. During such fights, it occurs that chicks get injured or even killed.<ref>Kosztol\u00e1nyi & Sz\u00e9kely, pers. obs.</ref> When approached by a predator, chicks usually try to find a spot where they can hide, crouch down and stay motionless to remain unseen. When they are older, they try to run away with their parents.\n\n===Nesting and Incubation===\n[[File:Kentish Plover nest.jpg|left|thumb|A Kentish Plover nest, with a standard grey card]]\nKentish plovers either nest solitarily or in a loose [[semicolonial]] manner. They are ground-nesting birds that lay their eggs in small shallow scrapes prepared by the male during courtship on the bare ground. Selection of the breeding ground is essential for the survival of nests and broods; nests are placed near the water on bare earth or in sparse vegetation; often on slightly elevated sites in order to have a good view of the surroundings to spot predators from a distance or near small bushes, plants or grass clusters,<ref>Snow, D.W. and Perrins, C.M. 1998. The Birds of the Western Palearctic, Volume 1: Non-Passerines. Oxford University Press, Oxford</ref> where the eggs are partly sheltered from predators. Nests are filled with nest material i.e. pebble stones, small parts of shells, fish bones, small twigs, grass and other debris.<ref name=\"d\" /> The modal [[clutch size]] comprises three eggs, although some nests are already completed with one or two eggs. In fresh or incomplete nests, the eggs tend to be fully exposed, but as the incubation period progresses, the amount of nest material increases and the eggs become practically completely covered.<ref name=\"a\" /> During the incubation period, the Kentish plover recesses for variable periods of time mainly to forage or to perform other activities essential for self-maintenance. To compensate for the resulting lack of presence and increased predation risk, they use nest materials to cover and hence camouflage the eggs and keep them insulated.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1163/1568539x-00003008| hdl=10261/89099| title=Dual function of egg-covering in the Kentish plover Charadrius alexandrinus| year=2012| last1=Masero| first1=Jos\u00e9 A.| last2=Monsa| first2=Roc\u00edo| last3=Amat| first3=Juan A.| journal=Behaviour| volume=149| issue=8| pages=881\u2013895}}</ref> Kentish plovers regulate the amount of nest material actively.

Using a transponder system to monitor incubation routines of snowy plovers. J. Field Ornithol. (in press)</ref> Female Kentish plovers usually lose mass during the day, which is unexpected since they get relieved by the males for a variable amount of time. The loss would be much higher if the females were to incubate alone. This loss is a cost of incubation due to the depletion of fat stores and the evaporation of water.<ref>Szentirmai, I., Kosztol\u00e1nyi, A. and Sz\u00e9kely, T. 2001. Daily changes in body mass of incubating Kentish Plovers. Ornis Hung. 11: 27-32</ref>\n\n==Parental Care==\n[[File:Kentish Plover Chick.jpg|thumb|A Kentish Plover Chick]]\nParental care is variable within birds and the Kentish plover has a slightly different mechanism to other shorebirds. As discussed above, both parents incubate the eggs, however both parents do not always stick around once the eggs have hatched. It is not unusual for one parent to leave the chicks after a variable amount of time; this is referred to as [[brood desertion]]. Brood desertion is the \u2018termination of care, by either one or both parents, before the offspring are capable of surviving independently\u2019 <ref>Fujioka, M. 1989. Mate and nestling desertion in colonial little egrets. Auk 106:292-302</ref> and usually occurs after one week of the brood being accompanied by both parents. Brood desertion has been observed in both males and females, however females desert the brood significantly more frequently than males.<ref name=\"g\" /> \nStudies have shown that both the male and female Kentish plover can provide adequate care for their brood on their own, so it is not the differences in the ability of the parents that determines which parent deserts the brood and which stays to care for the chicks. However, studies have also shown that after desertion females have a larger chance of breeding success than males, potentially due to many Kentish plover populations maintaining a male-biased OSR (operational sex ratio - the ratio of males actively breeding to females). Therefore, is it hypothesized that the amount of reproductive success gained by desertion is what actually determines who deserts the brood,.<ref>Cuthill, I., Sz\u00e9kely, T., McNamara, J. and Houston, A. 2002. Why do birds get divorced? NERC News Spring: 6-7</ref><ref name=\"f\" /> In short, males and females can care for their brood equally, however females gain more by deserting their brood than males, resulting in a higher amount of female desertion over male. The non-deserting parent can continue to brood their chicks up to 80% of the time for over 20 days after hatching, as precocial young are vulnerable and exposed to external temperatures.\n\n==Calls==\nThe alarm call, referred to as ''{{not a typo|kittup}}'' call, is often heard both on the ground and in the air and can occur on its own, or paired with a ''tweet'', heard as ''{{not a typo|too-eet}}''.

It is not near the threshold for \u2018Vulnerable\u2019 under the population size (<10,000 mature individuals with a constant decline reaching >10% within the next 10 years or three generations), since the global population is estimated being very large with 100,000 - 499,999 mature individuals. A closer estimate, needing further verification, is that the population size lies between 290,000 and 460,000 individuals. Moreover, the Kentish plover does not reach the threshold for being \u2018Vulnerable\u2019 on a level of range size (the area of occurrence being <20,000km2 in combination with a decline of population size, habitat area/quality or range size) because it is distributed over an area of 70,800,000 km2. Finally, although there is a decline in global population size, it does not reach the threshold for \u2018Vulnerable\u2019 in terms of population trend meaning >30% decline over 10 years or three generations.<ref name=\"i\">BirdLife International. 2017.

Downloaded from http://www.birdlife.org</ref>\n\n[[File:Hatching kp on nest.jpg|right|thumb|A Kentish Plover chick hatching, along with its sibling and an egg]]\n\n===Trends===\nThe global population size of the Kentish plover is continuously declining although for some populations the trends are unknown.<ref>Wetlands International. 2006. Waterbird Population Estimates \u2013 Fourth Edition. Wetlands International, Wageningen, The Netherlands</ref> The European population being estimated at 21,500-34,800 pairs, forming around 15% of the global range, is thought to decrease by less than 25% in 15 years/three generations.<ref name=\"i\" />\n\n===Threats===\nA major threat to this species is habitat loss and disturbance. Human activity such as tourists walking through protected areas, pollution, unsustainable harvesting and urbanisation can destroy nesting sites. Plover populations can also be affected by rural human activity, for example fishermen walking through protected plover breeding sites, bringing large numbers of dogs with them- a known predator of plover eggs. Natural predators are also a problem, as many of these predators appear to thrive unnaturally well in the presence of plover breeding grounds, such as the brown-necked raven (Corvus ruficollis) in Maio, Cape Verde, the White-tailed Mongoose (Ichneumia albicauda) in Saudi Arabia, and the Grey Monitors (Varanus griseus) in [[Al-Wathba Wetland Reserve]]. It is thought that the high amount of prey available to these predators attracts them into the breeding grounds- an effect named the 'honey pot',<ref>AlRashidi, M., Kosztol\u00e1nyi, A., Shobrak, M. and Sz\u00e9kely, T. 2011.

Breeding ecology of Kentish Plover Charadrius alexandrinus in Maio, Cape Verde. Unpublished Fieldwork Report, University of Bath</ref> Global warming and climate change also plays a role in the decline of areas available for plovers to breed and reside in. It is known that the Kentish plover prefers to build its nests on low-elevated land close to water, and a study untaken in Saudi Arabia discovered that 11% of nests in the study site were in fact below sea level, therefore rising sea levels are predicted to have disastrous consequences for these low-sitting nests,.<ref name=\"c\" /><ref>AlRashidi, M., Shobrak, M., Al-Eissa, M.S. and Sz\u00e9kely, T. 2012.

This is essential to stop pollution, land reclamation and urbanisation. Human interaction should be controlled and kept at a minimum.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons|Charadrius alexandrinus}}\n*{{Commons-inline|Charadrius nivosus}}\n*[http://aulaenred.ibercaja.es/wp-content/uploads/172_KentishPloverCalexandrinus.pdf Ageing and sexing (PDF; 2.2 MB) by Javier Blasco-Zumeta & Gerd-Michael Heinze]\n* [https://www.itis.gov/servlet/SingleRpt/SingleRpt?search_topic=TSN&search_value=176513#null ''Charadrius alexandrinus alexandrinus'' Linnaeus, 1758] at ITIS\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q18855}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:plover, Kentish}}\n[[Category:Charadrius|Kentish plover]]\n[[Category:Shorebirds|Kentish plover]]\n[[Category:Birds of Eurasia]]\n[[Category:Birds of North Africa]]\n[[Category:Birds of Macaronesia]]\n[[Category:Birds of Sri Lanka]]\n[[Category:Birds of Europe]]\n[[Category:Birds of Africa]]\n[[Category:Birds described in 1758|Kentish plover]]\n", "name_user": "Lfh", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eDistribution", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentish_plover"}

The poem was originally published anonymously (under the [[pen name]] \"Phin\", based on Thayer's college nickname, \"Phinney\").<ref name=\"Gardner\" />\n\n==Synopsis==\nA baseball team from the fictional town of \"Mudville\" (the home team) is losing by two [[Run (baseball)|runs]] in its last inning. Both the team and its fans, a crowd of 5,000, believe they can win if Casey, Mudville's star player, gets to bat. However, Casey is scheduled to be the fifth batter of the inning, and the first two batters (Cooney and Barrows) fail to get on base. The next two batters (Flynn and Jimmy Blake) are perceived to be weak hitters with little chance of reaching base to allow Casey a chance to bat.\n\nSurprisingly, Flynn hits a single, and Blake follows with a double that allows Flynn to reach third base.  Both runners are now in scoring position and Casey represents the potential winning run. Casey is so sure of his abilities that he does not swing at the first two pitches, both called strikes. On the last pitch, the overconfident Casey [[Strikeout|strikes out swinging]], ending the game and sending the crowd home unhappy.\n\n==Text==\n{{Listen\n |filename=CaseyAtTheBat.ogg\n |title=Casey at the Bat\n |description=Recited by [[DeWolf Hopper]], c. 1920.\n |format=[[Ogg]] }}\nThe text is filled with references to baseball as it was in 1888, which in many ways is not far removed from today's version. As a work, the poem encapsulates much of the appeal of baseball, including the involvement of the crowd. It also has a fair amount of baseball jargon that can pose challenges for the uninitiated.\n\nThis is the complete poem as it originally appeared in ''[[The San Francisco Examiner|The Daily Examiner]]''.  After publication, various versions with minor changes were produced.\n\n{{Quote_box\n|width=20%\n|align=right\n|quote=No one imagines that 'Casey' is great in the sense that the poetry of [[Shakespeare]] or [[Dante]] is great; a comic [[ballad]] obviously must be judged by different standards.

Thayer was only trying to write a comic ballad, with clanking rhymes and a vigorous beat, that could be read quickly, understood at once, and laughed at by any newspaper reader who knew baseball.

For example, in a review in 1893 of a variety show he was in, the ''Indianapolis News'' said, \"Many who attended the performance had heard of Kelly's singing and his reciting, and many had heard De Wolf Hopper recite 'Casey at the Bat' in his inimitable way.

The set-up was that [[Penn Jillette]] would leap off his chair upon finishing the poem, releasing the rope which supported Teller, and send his partner to a gruesome death if he wasn't free by that time.  The drama of the performance was taken up a notch after the third or fourth stanza, when Penn Jillette began to read out the rest of the poem much faster than the opening stanzas, greatly reducing the time that Teller had left to work free from his bonds.\n\nOn July 4, 2008, Jack Williams recited the poem accompanied by the [[Boston Pops]] during the annual Boston Pops Fireworks Spectacular at Boston's [[Fourth of July]] Celebration.\n\nOn July 14, 2013, the jam rock band [[Furthur (band)|Furthur]] performed the poem as part of a second-set medley in center field of Doubleday Field in Cooperstown, New York.<ref>https://archive.org/details/furthur2013-07-14.AKGc1000s</ref>\n\n==Recordings==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=May 2017}}\n{{external media | width = 210px | float = right | headerimage=[[File:2014DworskyKeillor.jpg|210px]] | video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwylSCS-OP4 Casey at the Bat], [[Garrison Keillor]] with [[Rich Dworsky]], [[Prairie Home Companion]], 5:29, July 14, 2013 | accessdate = October 15, 2015\n}}\n\nThe first recorded version of \"Casey at the Bat\" was made by [[Russell Hunting]], speaking in a broad Irish accent, in 1893; an [http://cylinders.library.ucsb.edu/search.php?queryType=@attr+1=1020&num=1&start=1&query=cylinder5348 1898 cylinder recording of the text made for the Columbia Graphophone label by Hunting] can be accessed from the [[Cylinder Preservation and Digitization Project]] at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] Library.\n\n[[DeWolf Hopper]]'s more famous recorded recitation was released in October 1906.\n\nIn 1946, [[Walt Disney]] released a recording of the narration of the poem by [[Jerry Colonna (entertainer)|Jerry Colonna]], which accompanied the studio's [[animated cartoon]] adaptation of the poem (see below).\n\nIn 1973, the [[Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra]] commissioned its former Composer-in-Residence, [[Frank Proto]], to create a work to feature Baseball Hall-of-Famer [[Johnny Bench]] with the orchestra.

In 1887, Thayer covered baseball for ''[[The San Francisco Examiner|The Daily Examiner]]''\u2014owned by his Harvard classmate [[William Randolph Hearst]]\u2014and is said to have covered the local [[California League]] team, the [[Stockton Ports]]. For the [[1902 in baseball|1902]] season, after the poem became popular, Stockton's team was renamed the Mudville Nine. The team reverted to the Mudville Nine moniker for the 2000 and 2001 seasons.

Casey's team is down ''three'' runs by the last of the ninth, and once again Casey is down to two strikes\u2014with the bases full this time. However, he connects, hits the ball so far that it is never found.\n\n*In response to the popularity of the 1946 Walt Disney animated adaptation, Disney made a sequel, ''Casey Bats Again'' (1954), in which Casey's nine daughters redeem his reputation.\n*In 1988, on the 100th anniversary of the poem, ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' writer [[Frank Deford]] constructed a fanciful story (later expanded to book form) which posited Katie Casey, the subject of the song \"[[Take Me Out to the Ball Game]]\", as being the daughter of the famous slugger from the poem.\n*In 2010, Ken Eagle wrote \"The Mudville Faithful\", covering a century of the Mudville nine's fortunes since Casey struck out. Faithful fans still root for the perpetually losing team, and are finally rewarded by a trip to the World Series, led by Casey's great-grandson who is also named Casey.\n\n===Parodies===\nOf the many [[parody|parodies]] made of the poem, some of the notable ones include:\n*''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' magazine republished the original version of the poem in the 1950s with artwork by [[Jack Davis (cartoonist)|Jack Davis]] and no alterations to the text.

A \"Poetry Round Robin\" where famous poems are rewritten in the style of the next poet in line, featured Casey at the Bat as written by [[Edgar Allan Poe]].\n*[[Foster Brooks]] (\"the Lovable Lush\") wrote \"Riley on the Mound\", which recounts the story from the pitcher's perspective.

The poem replaced Flynn and Blake with [[Bobby Doerr]] and [[Johnny Pesky]], the batters who preceded Williams in the 1946 Red Sox lineup.\n*In 2000, Michael J.

The poem was originally published anonymously (under the [[pen name]] \"Phin\", based on Thayer's college nickname, \"Phinney\").<ref name=\"Gardner\" />\n\n==Synopsis==\nA baseball team from the fictional town of \"Mudville\" (the home team) is losing by two [[Run (baseball)|runs]] in its last inning. Both the team and its fans, a crowd of 5,000, believe they can win if Casey, Mudville's star player, gets to bat. However, Casey is scheduled to be the fifth batter of the inning, and the first two batters (Cooney and Barrows) fail to get on base. The next two batters (Flynn and Jimmy Blake) are perceived to be weak hitters with little chance of reaching base to allow Casey a chance to bat.\n\nSurprisingly, Flynn hits a single, and Blake follows with a double that allows Flynn to reach third base.  Both runners are now in scoring position and Casey represents the potential winning run. Casey is so sure of his abilities that he does not swing at the first two pitches, both called strikes. On the last pitch, the overconfident Casey [[Strikeout|strikes out swinging]], ending the game and sending the crowd home unhappy.\n\n==Text==\n{{Listen\n |filename=CaseyAtTheBat.ogg\n |title=Casey at the Bat\n |description=Recited by [[DeWolf Hopper]], c. 1920.\n |format=[[Ogg]] }}\nThe text is filled with references to baseball as it was in 1888, which in many ways is not far removed from today's version. As a work, the poem encapsulates much of the appeal of baseball, including the involvement of the crowd. It also has a fair amount of baseball jargon that can pose challenges for the uninitiated.\n\nThis is the complete poem as it originally appeared in ''[[The San Francisco Examiner|The Daily Examiner]]''.

Kill the umpire!\" shouted someone on the stand;\nand it's likely they'd have killed him had not Casey raised his hand.\n\nWith a smile of Christian charity great Casey's visage shone;\nhe stilled the rising tumult; he bade the game go on;\nhe signaled to the pitcher, and once more the spheroid flew;\nbut Casey still ignored it, and the umpire said: \"Strike two.\"\n\n\"Fraud!\" cried the maddened thousands, and Echo answered fraud;\nbut one scornful look from Casey and the audience was awed.\nThey saw his face grow stern and cold, they saw his muscles strain,\nand they knew that Casey wouldn't let that ball go by again.\n\nThe sneer is gone from Casey's lip, his teeth are clenched in hate;\nhe pounds with cruel violence his bat upon the plate.\nAnd now the pitcher holds the ball, and now he lets it go,\nand now the air is shattered by the force of Casey's blow.\n\nOh, somewhere in this favored land the sun is shining bright;\nthe band is playing somewhere, and somewhere hearts are light,\nand somewhere men are laughing, and somewhere children shout;\nbut there is no joy in Mudville \u2014 mighty Casey has struck out.</poem>}}\n\n==Inspiration==\nThayer said he chose the name \"Casey\" after a non-player of Irish ancestry he once knew, and it is open to debate who, if anyone, he modeled the character after.

The set-up was that [[Penn Jillette]] would leap off his chair upon finishing the poem, releasing the rope which supported Teller, and send his partner to a gruesome death if he wasn't free by that time.  The drama of the performance was taken up a notch after the third or fourth stanza, when Penn Jillette began to read out the rest of the poem much faster than the opening stanzas, greatly reducing the time that Teller had left to work free from his bonds.\n\nOn July 4, 2008, Jack Williams recited the poem accompanied by the [[Boston Pops]] during the annual Boston Pops Fireworks Spectacular at Boston's [[Fourth of July]] Celebration.\n\nOn July 14, 2013, the jam rock band [[Furthur (band)|Furthur]] performed the poem as part of a second-set medley in center field of Doubleday Field in Cooperstown, New York.<ref>https://archive.org/details/furthur2013-07-14.AKGc1000s</ref>\n\n==Recordings==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=May 2017}}\n{{external media | width = 210px | float = right | headerimage=[[File:2014DworskyKeillor.jpg|210px]] | video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwylSCS-OP4 Casey at the Bat], [[Garrison Keillor]] with [[Rich Dworsky]], [[Prairie Home Companion]], 5:29, July 14, 2013 | accessdate = October 15, 2015\n}}\n\nThe first recorded version of \"Casey at the Bat\" was made by [[Russell Hunting]], speaking in a broad Irish accent, in 1893; an [http://cylinders.library.ucsb.edu/search.php?queryType=@attr+1=1020&num=1&start=1&query=cylinder5348 1898 cylinder recording of the text made for the Columbia Graphophone label by Hunting] can be accessed from the [[Cylinder Preservation and Digitization Project]] at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] Library.\n\n[[DeWolf Hopper]]'s more famous recorded recitation was released in October 1906.\n\nIn 1946, [[Walt Disney]] released a recording of the narration of the poem by [[Jerry Colonna (entertainer)|Jerry Colonna]], which accompanied the studio's [[animated cartoon]] adaptation of the poem (see below).\n\nIn 1973, the [[Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra]] commissioned its former Composer-in-Residence, [[Frank Proto]], to create a work to feature Baseball Hall-of-Famer [[Johnny Bench]] with the orchestra.

In 1887, Thayer covered baseball for ''[[The San Francisco Examiner|The Daily Examiner]]''\u2014owned by his Harvard classmate [[William Randolph Hearst]]\u2014and is said to have covered the local [[California League]] team, the [[Stockton Ports]]. For the [[1902 in baseball|1902]] season, after the poem became popular, Stockton's team was renamed the Mudville Nine. The team reverted to the Mudville Nine moniker for the 2000 and 2001 seasons.

This version is recited by [[Jerry Colonna (entertainer)|Jerry Colonna]]. It was later released as an individual short on July 16, 1954. Several differences from the original text include, but are not limited to; Barrows failing to get off base when he smacks the ball back into the pitcher's mitt, Flynn letting drive a single due to trying to get the bat out of his moustache and Blake getting a double due to an attempt by the visiting team's catcher to set his foot on fire.\n* The poem is cited in Frederic Wiseman's documentary ''[[High school (North America)|High School]]'' (1968) by a teacher in a classroom.\n*In 1986, [[Elliott Gould]] starred as \"Casey\" in the ''[[Shelley Duvall]]'s Tall Tales and Legends'' adaptation of the story, which also starred [[Carol Kane]], [[Howard Cosell]], [[Bob Uecker]], [[Bill Macy]] and [[Rae Dawn Chong]].

It was written in 1906, and its first known publication was in the quarterly magazine ''The Speaker'' in June 1907, under the pseudonym of James Wilson.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gardner|first=Martin|title=The Annotated Casey at the Bat: A Collection of Ballads About the Mighty Casey|year=1995|publisher=Dover Publications|isbn=0-486-28598-7|page=38}}</ref> In this version, Rice cites the nickname \"Strike-Out Casey\", hence the influence on [[Casey Stengel]]'s name. Casey's team is down ''three'' runs by the last of the ninth, and once again Casey is down to two strikes\u2014with the bases full this time. However, he connects, hits the ball so far that it is never found.\n\n*In response to the popularity of the 1946 Walt Disney animated adaptation, Disney made a sequel, ''Casey Bats Again'' (1954), in which Casey's nine daughters redeem his reputation.\n*In 1988, on the 100th anniversary of the poem, ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' writer [[Frank Deford]] constructed a fanciful story (later expanded to book form) which posited Katie Casey, the subject of the song \"[[Take Me Out to the Ball Game]]\", as being the daughter of the famous slugger from the poem.\n*In 2010, Ken Eagle wrote \"The Mudville Faithful\", covering a century of the Mudville nine's fortunes since Casey struck out. Faithful fans still root for the perpetually losing team, and are finally rewarded by a trip to the World Series, led by Casey's great-grandson who is also named Casey.\n\n===Parodies===\nOf the many [[parody|parodies]] made of the poem, some of the notable ones include:\n*''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' magazine republished the original version of the poem in the 1950s with artwork by [[Jack Davis (cartoonist)|Jack Davis]] and no alterations to the text.

In its business activities, DAMRI carries out city transport, transport within province, intercity transport, airport transport, tourism transport, logistics transport, transport to isolated areas and Inter-country transport.\n\n==History==\nDAMRI's history officially began in 1943, with the establishment of two enterprises during the [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia|Japanese occupation of Java]]: {{nihongo|the Java Transportation Enterprise|\u30b8\u30e3\u30ef\u904b\u8f38\u4e8b\u696d\u793e|Jawa Un'yu Jigy\u014dsha|lead=yes|extra=[[Nihon-shiki]]: ''Zyawa Un'yu Zigy\u00f4sya''}} for freight logistics, and the {{nihongo|Automobile Board|\u81ea\u52d5\u8eca\u7dcf\u5c40|Jid\u014dsha S\u014dkyoku|lead=yes|extra=[[Nihon-shiki]]: ''Zid\u00f4sha S\u00f4kyoku''}} for passenger transport. After [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|Indonesia proclaimed independence in 1945]], Java Transportation Enterprise changed its name to Djawatan Pengangkoetan (Transport Enterprise) and Automobile Board changed its name to Djawatan Angkoetan Darat (Land Transport Enterprise) as both enterprises were taken over by the [[Ministry of Transportation (Indonesia)|Indonesian Department of Transportation]].<br>\n\nBy 25 November 1946, both enterprises were merged, through a [[Ministry of Transportation (Indonesia)|Ministry of Transportation]] announcement ({{lang-id|Maklumat Menteri Perhubungan No.01/DAM/46}}), into Djawatan Angkoetan Motor Repoeblik Indonesia (DAMRI). It was tasked to \"operate land transportation by buses, trucks and other types of motor vehicles\".<br>\n\nDAMRI has played an active role during the [[Indonesian National Revolution]], especially during the resistance against the [[Politionele acties|Dutch military aggressions]].<br>\n\nIn 1961, DAMRI was reorganized as a General Director Board ({{lang-id|Badan Pimpinan Umum, BPU}}).

In its business activities, DAMRI carries out city transport, transport within province, intercity transport, airport transport, tourism transport, logistics transport, transport to isolated areas and Inter-country transport.\n\n==History==\nDAMRI's history officially began in 1943, with the establishment of two enterprises during the [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia|Japanese occupation of Java]]: {{nihongo|the Java Transportation Enterprise|\u30b8\u30e3\u30ef\u904b\u8f38\u4e8b\u696d\u793e|Jawa Un'yu Jigy\u014dsha|lead=yes|extra=[[Nihon-shiki]]: ''Zyawa Un'yu Zigy\u00f4sya''}} for freight logistics, and the {{nihongo|Automobile Board|\u81ea\u52d5\u8eca\u7dcf\u5c40|Jid\u014dsha S\u014dkyoku|lead=yes|extra=[[Nihon-shiki]]: ''Zid\u00f4sha S\u00f4kyoku''}} for passenger transport. After [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|Indonesia proclaimed independence in 1945]], Java Transportation Enterprise changed its name to Djawatan Pengangkoetan (Transport Enterprise) and Automobile Board changed its name to Djawatan Angkoetan Darat (Land Transport Enterprise) as both enterprises were taken over by the [[Ministry of Transportation (Indonesia)|Indonesian Department of Transportation]].<br>\n\nBy 25 November 1946, both enterprises were merged, through a [[Ministry of Transportation (Indonesia)|Ministry of Transportation]] announcement ({{lang-id|Maklumat Menteri Perhubungan No.01/DAM/46}}), into Djawatan Angkoetan Motor Repoeblik Indonesia (DAMRI). It was tasked to \"operate land transportation by buses, trucks and other types of motor vehicles\".<br>\n\nDAMRI has played an active role during the [[Indonesian National Revolution]], especially during the resistance against the [[Politionele acties|Dutch military aggressions]].<br>\n\nIn 1961, DAMRI was reorganized as a General Director Board ({{lang-id|Badan Pimpinan Umum, BPU}}). In 1965 the DAMRI BPU became a State Corporation ({{lang-id|Perusahaan Negara, PN}}), and in 1982 it was reorganized as a public corporation.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.damrilogistics.co.id/tentang-kami| title=Sejarah Singkat| language=id| publisher=Damri Logistics|accessdate=March 10, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://damri.co.id/sejarah| title=Sejarah | language=id| publisher=Damri|accessdate=March 10, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==DAMRI offices==\n''' Perum DAMRI Head Office'''\n: Jl.
