[[Boniface IX]], who was crowned at Rome in 1389, and [[Antipope Benedict XIII|Benedict XIII]], who reigned in Avignon from 1394, maintained their rival courts. When Pope Boniface died in 1404, the eight cardinals of the Roman conclave offered to refrain from electing a new pope if Benedict would resign; but when Benedict's legates refused on his behalf, the Roman party then proceeded to elect Pope [[Pope Innocent VII|Innocent VII]].\n\nIn the intense partisanship, characteristic of the Middle Ages, the schism engendered a fanatical hatred noted by [[Johan Huizinga]]:<ref>Huizinga, ''[[The Autumn of the Middle Ages|The Waning of the Middle Ages]]'', 1924:14</ref> when the town of [[Bruges]] went over to the \"obedience\" of Avignon, a great number of people left to follow their trade in a city of Urbanist allegiance; in the 1382 [[Battle of Roosebeke]], the [[oriflamme]], which might only be unfurled in a holy cause, was taken up against the [[Flemings]], because they were Urbanists and thus viewed by the French as schismatics.{{Citation needed|reason=the articles about the battle doesn't mention the reason, the article about the oriflamme doesn't mention the condition|date=July 2017}}\n\nEfforts were made to end the Schism through force or diplomacy. The French crown even tried to coerce Benedict XIII, whom it supported, into resigning. None of these remedies worked. The suggestion that a [[Ecumenical Council|church council]] should resolve the Schism, first made in 1378, was not adopted at first, because [[canon law]] required that a pope call a council.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} Eventually theologians like [[Pierre d'Ailly]] and Jean Gerson, as well as canon lawyers like [[Francesco Zabarella]], adopted arguments that equity permitted the Church to act for its own welfare in defiance of the [[letter of the law]].\n\nEventually the cardinals of both factions secured an agreement that Benedict and Pope [[Gregory XII]] (successor to Innocent VII) would meet at [[Savona]]. They balked at the last moment, and both groups of cardinals abandoned their preferred leaders. [[Council of Pisa|A church council was held]] at [[Pisa]] in 1409 under the auspices of the cardinals to try solving the dispute. At the fifteenth session, 5 June 1409, the Council of Pisa attempted to depose both Pope and antipope as schismatical, heretical, perjured and scandalous,<ref>J. P. Adams, [http://www.csun.edu/~hcfll004/1410_Council_Pisa_XV.html ''Council of Pisa: Deposition of Benedict XIII and Gregory XII''], with additional references. Retrieved 02/26/2106.</ref> but it then added to the problem by electing a second antipope, [[Antipope Alexander V|Alexander V]]. He reigned briefly from June 26, 1409, to his death in 1410, when he was succeeded by antipope [[Antipope John XXIII|John XXIII]], who won some but not universal support.\n\n==Resolution==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}\nFinally,  [[Council of Constance|a council was convened]] by Pisan antipope [[Antipope John XXIII|John XXIII]] in 1414 at [[Constance]] to resolve the issue. This was endorsed by Pope [[Gregory XII]], thus ensuring the legitimacy of any election. The council, advised by the theologian [[Jean Gerson]], secured the resignations of John XXIII and Pope Gregory XII, who resigned in 1415, while [[excommunication|excommunicating]] the second antipope, [[Antipope Benedict XIII|Benedict XIII]], who refused to step down. The Council elected [[Pope Martin V]] in 1417, essentially ending the schism. Nonetheless, the Crown of Aragon did not recognize Pope Martin V and continued to recognize Benedict XIII. Archbishops loyal to Benedict XIII subsequently elected [[Antipope Benedict XIV]] (Bernard Garnier) and three followers simultaneously elected [[Antipope Clement VIII]], but the Western Schism was by then practically over. Clement VIII resigned in 1429 and apparently recognized Martin V.\n\nThe line of Roman popes is now recognized as the legitimate line, but confusion on this point continued until the 19th century. Pope [[Pius II]] (died 1464) decreed that no appeal could be made from pope to council, to avoid any future attempts to undo a papal election by anyone but the elected pope. No such crisis has arisen since the 15th century, and so there has been no need to revisit this decision. The alternate papal claimants have become known in history as [[antipope]]s. Those of Avignon were dismissed by Rome early on, but the Pisan popes were included in the ''Annuario Pontificio'' as popes well into the 20th century. Thus the Borgia pope [[Pope Alexander VI|Alexander VI]] took his regnal name in sequence after the Pisan Alexander V.\n\nGregory XII's resignation (in 1415) was the last time a pope resigned until [[Pope Benedict XVI|Benedict XVI]] in 2013.\n\n== Aftermath ==\nAfter its resolution, the Western Schism still affected the Catholic Church for years to come. One of the most significant of these involved the emergence of the theory called [[conciliarism]], founded on the success of the [[Council of Constance]], which effectively ended the conflict. This new reform movement held that a general council is superior to the pope on the strength of its capability to settle things even in the early church such as the case in 681 when [[Pope Honorius I|Pope Honorius]] was condemned by a council called Constantinople III.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Pilgrim Church: A Popular History of Catholic Christianity|last=Bausch|first=William|last2=Cannon|first2=Carol Ann|last3=Obach|first3=Robert|publisher=Twenty-Third Publications|year=1989|isbn=0896223957|location=Mystic, CT|pages=211}}</ref> There are theorists such as [[Jean Gerson|John Gerson]] who explained that the priests and the church itself are the sources of the papal power and, thus, the church should be able to correct, punish, and, if necessary, depose a pope.<ref>Bausch, Cannon, & Oback, p. 211.</ref> For years, the so-called conciliarists have challenged the authority of the pope and they became more relevant after a convened council also known as the [[Council of Florence]] (1439\u20131445) became instrumental in achieving ecclesial union between the Catholic Church and the churches of the East.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Hidden Manna: A Theology of the Eucharist|last=O'Connor|first=James Thomas|publisher=Ignatius Press|year=2005|isbn=1586170767|location=San Francisco|pages=204}}</ref>\n\nThere was also a marked decline in morality and discipline within the church. Scholars note that although the Western Schism did not directly cause such a phenomenon, it was a gradual development rooted in the conflict, effectively eroding the church authority and its capacity to proclaim the gospel.<ref>{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to Canon Law|last=Coriden|first=James|publisher=Paulist Press|year=2004|isbn=0809142562|location=New York|pages=21}}</ref> This was further aggravated by the dissension caused by the [[Reformation|Protestant Reformation]].\n\n==Historiography==\n\nAccording to Broderick, in 1987:\n{{quote|Doubt still shrouds the validity of the three rival lines of pontiffs during the four decades subsequent to the still disputed papal election of 1378. This makes suspect the credentials of the cardinals created by the Roman, Avignon, and Pisan claimants to the Apostolic See. Unity was finally restored without a definitive solution to the question; for the Council of Constance succeeded in terminating the Western Schism, not by declaring which of the three claimants was the rightful one, but by eliminating all of them by forcing their abdication or deposition, and then setting up a novel arrangement for choosing a new pope acceptable to all sides. To this day the Church has never made any official, authoritative pronouncement about the papal lines of succession for this confusing period; nor has Martin V or any of his successors. Modern scholars are not agreed in their solutions, although they tend to favor the Roman line.<ref>Broderick, J.F. 1987. \"The Sacred College of Cardinals: Size and Geographical Composition (1099\u20131986).\" ''Archivum historiae Pontificiae'', '''25''': p. 14.</ref>}}\n\nThe ''[[Annuario Pontificio]]'' has historically regarded the Roman line as legitimate and recognized the decisions of the [[Council of Pisa]] (1409). Until the mid-20th century, the ''Annuario Pontificio'' listed the last three popes of the schism as [[Pope Gregory XII|Gregory XII]] (1406\u20131409), [[Antipope Alexander V|Alexander V]] (1409\u20131410), and [[Antipope John XXIII|John XXIII]] (1410\u20131415).<ref>{{cite book |title=Annuario pontificio per l'anno 1942 |date=1942 |location=Rome |page=21 |quote=205.

[[Boniface IX]], who was crowned at Rome in 1389, and [[Antipope Benedict XIII|Benedict XIII]], who reigned in Avignon from 1394, maintained their rival courts. When Pope Boniface died in 1404, the eight cardinals of the Roman conclave offered to refrain from electing a new pope if Benedict would resign; but when Benedict's legates refused on his behalf, the Roman party then proceeded to elect Pope [[Pope Innocent VII|Innocent VII]].\n\nIn the intense partisanship, characteristic of the Middle Ages, the schism engendered a fanatical hatred noted by [[Johan Huizinga]]:<ref>Huizinga, ''[[The Autumn of the Middle Ages|The Waning of the Middle Ages]]'', 1924:14</ref> when the town of [[Bruges]] went over to the \"obedience\" of Avignon, a great number of people left to follow their trade in a city of Urbanist allegiance; in the 1382 [[Battle of Roosebeke]], the [[oriflamme]], which might only be unfurled in a holy cause, was taken up against the [[Flemings]], because they were Urbanists and thus viewed by the French as schismatics.{{Citation needed|reason=the articles about the battle doesn't mention the reason, the article about the oriflamme doesn't mention the condition|date=July 2017}}\n\nEfforts were made to end the Schism through force or diplomacy. The French crown even tried to coerce Benedict XIII, whom it supported, into resigning. None of these remedies worked. The suggestion that a [[Ecumenical Council|church council]] should resolve the Schism, first made in 1378, was not adopted at first, because [[canon law]] required that a pope call a council.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} Eventually theologians like [[Pierre d'Ailly]] and Jean Gerson, as well as canon lawyers like [[Francesco Zabarella]], adopted arguments that equity permitted the Church to act for its own welfare in defiance of the [[letter of the law]].\n\nEventually the cardinals of both factions secured an agreement that Benedict and Pope [[Gregory XII]] (successor to Innocent VII) would meet at [[Savona]]. They balked at the last moment, and both groups of cardinals abandoned their preferred leaders. [[Council of Pisa|A church council was held]] at [[Pisa]] in 1409 under the auspices of the cardinals to try solving the dispute. At the fifteenth session, 5 June 1409, the Council of Pisa attempted to depose both Pope and antipope as schismatical, heretical, perjured and scandalous,<ref>J. P. Adams, [http://www.csun.edu/~hcfll004/1410_Council_Pisa_XV.html ''Council of Pisa: Deposition of Benedict XIII and Gregory XII''], with additional references. Retrieved 02/26/2106.</ref> but it then added to the problem by electing a second antipope, [[Antipope Alexander V|Alexander V]]. He reigned briefly from June 26, 1409, to his death in 1410, when he was succeeded by antipope [[Antipope John XXIII|John XXIII]], who won some but not universal support.\n\n==Resolution==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}\nFinally,  [[Council of Constance|a council was convened]] by Pisan antipope [[Antipope John XXIII|John XXIII]] in 1414 at [[Constance]] to resolve the issue. This was endorsed by Pope [[Gregory XII]], thus ensuring the legitimacy of any election. The council, advised by the theologian [[Jean Gerson]], secured the resignations of John XXIII and Pope Gregory XII, who resigned in 1415, while [[excommunication|excommunicating]] the second antipope, [[Antipope Benedict XIII|Benedict XIII]], who refused to step down. The Council elected [[Pope Martin V]] in 1417, essentially ending the schism. Nonetheless, the Crown of Aragon did not recognize Pope Martin V and continued to recognize Benedict XIII. Archbishops loyal to Benedict XIII subsequently elected [[Antipope Benedict XIV]] (Bernard Garnier) and three followers simultaneously elected [[Antipope Clement VIII]], but the Western Schism was by then practically over. Clement VIII resigned in 1429 and apparently recognized Martin V.\n\nThe line of Roman popes is now recognized as the legitimate line, but confusion on this point continued until the 19th century. Pope [[Pius II]] (died 1464) decreed that no appeal could be made from pope to council, to avoid any future attempts to undo a papal election by anyone but the elected pope. No such crisis has arisen since the 15th century, and so there has been no need to revisit this decision. The alternate papal claimants have become known in history as [[antipope]]s. Those of Avignon were dismissed by Rome early on, but the Pisan popes were included in the ''Annuario Pontificio'' as popes well into the 20th century. Thus the Borgia pope [[Pope Alexander VI|Alexander VI]] took his regnal name in sequence after the Pisan Alexander V.\n\nGregory XII's resignation (in 1415) was the last time a pope resigned until [[Pope Benedict XVI|Benedict XVI]] in 2013.\n\n== Aftermath ==\nAfter its resolution, the Western Schism still affected the Catholic Church for years to come. One of the most significant of these involved the emergence of the theory called [[conciliarism]], founded on the success of the [[Council of Constance]], which effectively ended the conflict. This new reform movement held that a general council is superior to the pope on the strength of its capability to settle things even in the early church such as the case in 681 when [[Pope Honorius I|Pope Honorius]] was condemned by a council called Constantinople III.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Pilgrim Church: A Popular History of Catholic Christianity|last=Bausch|first=William|last2=Cannon|first2=Carol Ann|last3=Obach|first3=Robert|publisher=Twenty-Third Publications|year=1989|isbn=0896223957|location=Mystic, CT|pages=211}}</ref> There are theorists such as [[Jean Gerson|John Gerson]] who explained that the priests and the church itself are the sources of the papal power and, thus, the church should be able to correct, punish, and, if necessary, depose a pope.<ref>Bausch, Cannon, & Oback, p. 211.</ref> For years, the so-called conciliarists have challenged the authority of the pope and they became more relevant after a convened council also known as the [[Council of Florence]] (1439\u20131445) became instrumental in achieving ecclesial union between the Catholic Church and the churches of the East.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Hidden Manna: A Theology of the Eucharist|last=O'Connor|first=James Thomas|publisher=Ignatius Press|year=2005|isbn=1586170767|location=San Francisco|pages=204}}</ref>\n\nThere was also a marked decline in morality and discipline within the church. Scholars note that although the Western Schism did not directly cause such a phenomenon, it was a gradual development rooted in the conflict, effectively eroding the church authority and its capacity to proclaim the gospel.<ref>{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to Canon Law|last=Coriden|first=James|publisher=Paulist Press|year=2004|isbn=0809142562|location=New York|pages=21}}</ref> This was further aggravated by the dissension caused by the [[Reformation|Protestant Reformation]].\n\n==Historiography==\n\nAccording to Broderick, in 1987:\n{{quote|Doubt still shrouds the validity of the three rival lines of pontiffs during the four decades subsequent to the still disputed papal election of 1378. This makes suspect the credentials of the cardinals created by the Roman, Avignon, and Pisan claimants to the Apostolic See. Unity was finally restored without a definitive solution to the question; for the Council of Constance succeeded in terminating the Western Schism, not by declaring which of the three claimants was the rightful one, but by eliminating all of them by forcing their abdication or deposition, and then setting up a novel arrangement for choosing a new pope acceptable to all sides. To this day the Church has never made any official, authoritative pronouncement about the papal lines of succession for this confusing period; nor has Martin V or any of his successors. Modern scholars are not agreed in their solutions, although they tend to favor the Roman line.<ref>Broderick, J.F. 1987. \"The Sacred College of Cardinals: Size and Geographical Composition (1099\u20131986).\" ''Archivum historiae Pontificiae'', '''25''': p. 14.</ref>}}\n\nThe ''[[Annuario Pontificio]]'' has historically regarded the Roman line as legitimate and recognized the decisions of the [[Council of Pisa]] (1409). Until the mid-20th century, the ''Annuario Pontificio'' listed the last three popes of the schism as [[Pope Gregory XII|Gregory XII]] (1406\u20131409), [[Antipope Alexander V|Alexander V]] (1409\u20131410), and [[Antipope John XXIII|John XXIII]] (1410\u20131415).<ref>{{cite book |title=Annuario pontificio per l'anno 1942 |date=1942 |location=Rome |page=21 |quote=205.
