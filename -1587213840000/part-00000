Godfrey did not back down, however, and killed Adalbert in battle.  Henry subsequently bestowed it on G\u00e9rard, but the deposed duke continued to stir.  Godfrey had the support of a faction of the nobles who did not want a strong hand at the ducal helm and G\u00e9rard was imprisoned. G\u00e9rard, however, had the support of the chiefest of his [[bishop]]s, that of [[Diocese of Toul|Toul]], Bruno of Eguisheim-Dagsburg (later the sainted [[Pope Leo IX]]), who procured his liberation in 1049.  The emperor gave him troops to assist him in his fight, for the rebels had the support of some elements in the church. G\u00e9rard himself remained, as his brother had, faithful to the end to the imperial dynasty and his descendants would remain so as well even into the [[Hohenstaufen]] years.\n\nHis alliance with the church was regular but inconstant and he afforded his protection to [[Moyenmoutier Abbey]], [[Saint Mihiel Abbey|Saint-Mihiel Abbey]], and [[Remiremont Abbey]].  The former was the abbey of [[Humbert of Mourmoutiers|Cardinal Humbert of Silva Candida]], who excommunicated the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|patriarch of Constantinople]], [[Michael I Cerularius]], in 1054, thus precipitating the [[East\u2013West Schism|Great Schism]], and the latter was his own final resting place.\n\nOn 18 June 1053, G\u00e9rard and Prince [[Rudolf of Benevento]] led papal and [[Swabia]]n troops into battle on behalf of Pope Leo. This was the [[Battle of Civitate]] and it was a disastrous loss for the pope. His enemy, the [[Normans]], under [[Humphrey of Hauteville]] and [[Richard of Aversa]], defeated his allies and captured his person, taking him prisoner in Benevento. Gerard, however, returned to Lorraine.\n\nAmong his other construction projects, was that of the castle of [[Pr\u00e9ny]], in the centre of the duchy, the beginnings of the capital city, [[Nancy, France|Nancy]].

These were not political parties in the modern sense but somewhat loose alliances of interests and individuals. The Whigs included many of the leading aristocratic dynasties committed to the Protestant succession, and later drew support from elements of the emerging industrial interests and wealthy merchants, while the Tories were associated with the [[landed gentry]], the [[Church of England]] and the [[Church of Scotland]].\n\nBy the mid 19th century, the Tories had evolved into the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], and the Whigs had evolved into the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]]. The concept of right and left came originally from France, where the supporters of a monarchy (constitutional or absolute) sat on the right wing of the National Assembly, and republicans on the left. In the late 19th century the Liberal Party began to lean towards the left. [[Liberal Unionist Party|Liberal Unionists]] split off from the Liberals over [[Irish Home Rule movement|Irish Home Rule]] and moved closer to the Conservatives over time.\n\nThe Liberals and Conservatives dominated the political scene until the 1920s, when the Liberal Party declined in popularity and suffered a long stream of resignations. It was replaced as the main anti-Tory opposition party by the newly emerging [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], which represented an alliance between the [[labour movement]], organised [[Trade unions in the United Kingdom|trades unions]] and various [[Socialist society (Labour Party)|socialist societies]].\n\nSince then the Conservative and Labour parties have dominated British politics, and have alternated in government ever since. However, the UK is not quite a two-party system as other parties have significant support. The [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] were the third largest party until the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]] when they were overtaken by the [[Scottish National Party]] in terms of seats and UK political party membership, and by the [[UK Independence Party]] in terms of votes.\n\nThe UK's [[First Past the Post]] electoral system leaves small parties disadvantaged on a UK-wide scale. It can, however, allow parties with concentrations of supporters in the [[Countries of the United Kingdom|constituent countries]] to flourish. In the 2015 election there was widespread controversy<ref>{{cite news|title=Whatever you think of Ukip or the Greens, our electoral system is robbing them|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/general-election-2015/politics-blog/11606354/Whatever-you-think-of-Ukip-or-the-Greens-our-electoral-system-is-robbing-them.html|accessdate=25 May 2015|date=14 May 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Green party leader condemns first-past-the-post voting system|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/09/australian-born-leader-of-uk-greens-blasts-british-voting-system|accessdate=25 May 2015|date=9 May 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=General Election 2015: Sixty per cent of people want voting reform, says survey|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/generalelection/general-election-2015-sixty-per-cent-of-people-want-voting-reform-says-survey-10224354.html|accessdate=25 May 2015|date=5 May 2015}}</ref> when [[UK Independence Party|UKIP]] and the [[Green Party of England and Wales]] received 4.9 million votes<ref>{{cite news|title=Election 2015|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election/2015/results|accessdate=25 May 2015}}</ref> (12.6% of the total vote for UKIP and 3.8% for the Greens) yet only gained one seat each in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]].

In these bodies, other parties have had success.\n\nTraditionally political parties have been private organisations with no official recognition by the state. The [[Registration of Political Parties Act 1998]] changed that by creating a register of parties.\n\nMembership of political parties has been in decline in the UK since the 1950s, falling by over 65% from 1983 (4% of the electorate) to 2005 (1.3%).<ref>\nJohn Marshall: Membership of UK political parties; House of Commons, SN/SG/5125; 2009, page 6. www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/briefings/snsg-05125.pdf Retrieved 5 January 2012</ref>\n\n===Register of political parties===\nThe [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission's]] Register of Political Parties<ref>{{cite web|url=http://search.electoralcommission.org.uk/Search/Registrations?currentPage=1&rows=10&sort=RegulatedEntityName&order=asc&et=pp&et=ppm&register=gb&register=ni&register=none&regStatus=registered|title=Party Finance \u2013 The Electoral Commission : Regulatory issues : Political parties : Registers : Register of political parties |publisher=Search.electoralcommission.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-08-03}}</ref> lists the details of parties registered to fight elections in the United Kingdom, including their registered name.

These were not political parties in the modern sense but somewhat loose alliances of interests and individuals. The Whigs included many of the leading aristocratic dynasties committed to the Protestant succession, and later drew support from elements of the emerging industrial interests and wealthy merchants, while the Tories were associated with the [[landed gentry]], the [[Church of England]] and the [[Church of Scotland]].\n\nBy the mid 19th century, the Tories had evolved into the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], and the Whigs had evolved into the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]]. The concept of right and left came originally from France, where the supporters of a monarchy (constitutional or absolute) sat on the right wing of the National Assembly, and republicans on the left. In the late 19th century the Liberal Party began to lean towards the left. [[Liberal Unionist Party|Liberal Unionists]] split off from the Liberals over [[Irish Home Rule movement|Irish Home Rule]] and moved closer to the Conservatives over time.\n\nThe Liberals and Conservatives dominated the political scene until the 1920s, when the Liberal Party declined in popularity and suffered a long stream of resignations. It was replaced as the main anti-Tory opposition party by the newly emerging [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], which represented an alliance between the [[labour movement]], organised [[Trade unions in the United Kingdom|trades unions]] and various [[Socialist society (Labour Party)|socialist societies]].\n\nSince then the Conservative and Labour parties have dominated British politics, and have alternated in government ever since. However, the UK is not quite a two-party system as other parties have significant support. The [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] were the third largest party until the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]] when they were overtaken by the [[Scottish National Party]] in terms of seats and UK political party membership, and by the [[UK Independence Party]] in terms of votes.\n\nThe UK's [[First Past the Post]] electoral system leaves small parties disadvantaged on a UK-wide scale. It can, however, allow parties with concentrations of supporters in the [[Countries of the United Kingdom|constituent countries]] to flourish. In the 2015 election there was widespread controversy<ref>{{cite news|title=Whatever you think of Ukip or the Greens, our electoral system is robbing them|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/general-election-2015/politics-blog/11606354/Whatever-you-think-of-Ukip-or-the-Greens-our-electoral-system-is-robbing-them.html|accessdate=25 May 2015|date=14 May 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Green party leader condemns first-past-the-post voting system|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/09/australian-born-leader-of-uk-greens-blasts-british-voting-system|accessdate=25 May 2015|date=9 May 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=General Election 2015: Sixty per cent of people want voting reform, says survey|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/generalelection/general-election-2015-sixty-per-cent-of-people-want-voting-reform-says-survey-10224354.html|accessdate=25 May 2015|date=5 May 2015}}</ref> when [[UK Independence Party|UKIP]] and the [[Green Party of England and Wales]] received 4.9 million votes<ref>{{cite news|title=Election 2015|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election/2015/results|accessdate=25 May 2015}}</ref> (12.6% of the total vote for UKIP and 3.8% for the Greens) yet only gained one seat each in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]].

Map data are usually collected using a GPS unit, although this is not strictly necessary if an area has already been traced from satellite imagery.\n\nOnce the data has been collected, it is entered into the database by uploading it onto the project's website together with appropriate attribute data. As collecting and uploading data may be separated from editing objects, contribution to the project is possible without using a GPS unit.\n\nSome committed contributors adopt the task of mapping whole towns and cities, or organising mapping parties to gather the support of others to complete a map area. A large number of less active users contribute corrections and small additions to the map.\n\n=== Street-level image data ===\nIn addition to several different sets of satellite image backgrounds available to OSM editors, data from several street-level image platforms are available as map data photo overlays: [[Streetside|Bing Streetside]] 360\u00b0 image tracks, and the open and crowdsourced [[Mapillary]] and [[OpenStreetCam]] platforms, generally smartphone and other windshield-mounted camera images. Additionally, a Mapillary traffic sign data layer can be enabled; it is the product of user-submitted images.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://blog.mapillary.com/tutorials/2017/08/21/mapping-traffic-signs-in-osm.html|title=Fast Traffic Sign Mapping with OpenStreetMap and Mapillary|date=2017-08-21|work=The Mapillary Blog|access-date=2018-09-11|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Government data===\nSome government agencies have released official data on appropriate licences. This includes the United States, where works of the federal government are placed under [[public domain]].<ref>See [[Copyright status of work by the U.S. government]] for more details.</ref>\n\nIn the United States, OSM uses [[Landsat 7]] satellite imagery, Prototype Global Shorelines from [[NOAA]], and [[Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing|TIGER]] from the Census. In the UK, some [[Ordnance Survey]] OpenData is imported, while [[Natural Resources Canada]]'s CanVec vector data and [[GeoBase (geospatial data)|GeoBase]] provide landcover and streets.\n\n[[List of countries' copyright length|Out-of-copyright]] maps can be good sources of information about features that do not change frequently. Copyright periods vary, but in the UK [[Crown copyright]] expires after 50 years and hence Ordnance Survey maps until the 1960s can legally be used.

The application{{nbsp}}{{mdash}} what users access to edit maps and view changelogs, is powered by [[Ruby on Rails]]. The application also uses [[PostgreSQL]] for storage of user data and edit metadata. The default map is rendered by [[Mapnik]], stored in [[PostGIS]], and powered by an [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]] module called ''mod_tile''.

They are used both for representing linear features such as streets and rivers, and areas, like forests, parks, parking areas and lakes.\n* ''Relations'' are ordered lists of nodes, ways and relations (together called \"members\"), where each member can optionally have a \"role\" (a string). Relations are used for representing the relationship of existing nodes and ways. Examples include turn restrictions on roads, routes that span several existing ways (for instance, a long-distance motorway), and areas with holes.\n* ''[[Tag (metadata)|Tags]]'' are key-value pairs (both arbitrary strings). They are used to store [[metadata]] about the map objects (such as their type, their name and their physical properties). Tags are not free-standing, but are always attached to an object: to a node, a way or a relation. A recommended [[Ontology (computer science)|ontology]] of map features (the meaning of ''tags'') is [[openstreetmap:Map features|maintained on a wiki]]. New tagging schemes can always be proposed by a [[OpenStreetmap:Proposal process|popular vote of a written proposal]] in OpenStreetMap wiki, however, there is no requirement to follow this process.

Map data are usually collected using a GPS unit, although this is not strictly necessary if an area has already been traced from satellite imagery.\n\nOnce the data has been collected, it is entered into the database by uploading it onto the project's website together with appropriate attribute data. As collecting and uploading data may be separated from editing objects, contribution to the project is possible without using a GPS unit.\n\nSome committed contributors adopt the task of mapping whole towns and cities, or organising mapping parties to gather the support of others to complete a map area. A large number of less active users contribute corrections and small additions to the map.\n\n=== Street-level image data ===\nIn addition to several different sets of satellite image backgrounds available to OSM editors, data from several street-level image platforms are available as map data photo overlays: [[Streetside|Bing Streetside]] 360\u00b0 image tracks, and the open and crowdsourced [[Mapillary]] and [[OpenStreetCam]] platforms, generally smartphone and other windshield-mounted camera images. Additionally, a Mapillary traffic sign data layer can be enabled; it is the product of user-submitted images.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://blog.mapillary.com/tutorials/2017/08/21/mapping-traffic-signs-in-osm.html|title=Fast Traffic Sign Mapping with OpenStreetMap and Mapillary|date=2017-08-21|work=The Mapillary Blog|access-date=2018-09-11|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Government data===\nSome government agencies have released official data on appropriate licences. This includes the United States, where works of the federal government are placed under [[public domain]].<ref>See [[Copyright status of work by the U.S. government]] for more details.</ref>\n\nIn the United States, OSM uses [[Landsat 7]] satellite imagery, Prototype Global Shorelines from [[NOAA]], and [[Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing|TIGER]] from the Census. In the UK, some [[Ordnance Survey]] OpenData is imported, while [[Natural Resources Canada]]'s CanVec vector data and [[GeoBase (geospatial data)|GeoBase]] provide landcover and streets.\n\n[[List of countries' copyright length|Out-of-copyright]] maps can be good sources of information about features that do not change frequently. Copyright periods vary, but in the UK [[Crown copyright]] expires after 50 years and hence Ordnance Survey maps until the 1960s can legally be used. A complete set of UK 1&nbsp;inch/mile maps from the late 1940s and early 1950s has been collected, scanned, and is available online as a resource for contributors.\n\n===Route planning===\nIn February 2015, OpenStreetMap added route planning functionality to the map on its official website. The routing uses external services, namely [[OSRM]], [[GraphHopper]] and [[MapQuest]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Routing on OpenStreetMap.org {{!}} OpenStreetMap Blog|url = https://blog.openstreetmap.org/2015/02/16/routing-on-openstreetmap-org/|accessdate = 28 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nThere are other routing providers and applications listed in the official Routing wiki.\n\n==Map usage==\n\n===Software for viewing maps===\n[[File:Soho - map 1.png|thumb|OpenStreetMap of [[Soho]], central London, shown in \"standard\" OpenStreetMap layer]]\n[[File:MapBox Streets example of a map of Soho, London.png|thumb|Same as above, shown in [[Mapbox]] Streets layer]]\n[[File:India OpenStreetMap data loading in QGIS.gif|thumb|Raw OpenStreetMap data of India loading in [[QGIS]] for analysis and mapmaking]]{{See also|Comparison of free off-line GPS software#Free maps}}\n;[[Web browser]]\n:Data provided by the OpenStreetMap project can be viewed in a [[web browser]] with [[JavaScript]] support via [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP) on its official website.

This included all data contributed by members that did not agree to the new licensing terms, as well as all subsequent edits to those affected objects. It also included any data contributed based on input data that was not compatible with the new terms. Estimates suggested that over 97% of data would be retained globally, however certain regions would be affected more than others, such as in Australia where 24 to 84% of objects would be retained, depending on the type of object.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://odbl.poole.ch |title=OSM V1 Objects ODbL acceptance statistics |author=Simon Poole |accessdate=21 May 2012}}</ref> Ultimately, more than 99% of the data was retained, with Australia and Poland being the countries most severely affected by the change.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.osmfoundation.org/2012/07/26/automated-redactions-complete/ |title=Automated redactions complete |author=Harry Wood |accessdate=1 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nAll data added to the project needs to have a licence compatible with the Open Database Licence. This can include out-of-copyright information, public domain or other licences. Contributors agree to a [[OpenStreetmap:Copyright|set of terms]] which require compatibility with the current licence. This may involve examining licences for government data to establish whether it is compatible.\n\nSoftware used in the production and presentation of OpenStreetMap data is available from many different projects and each may have its own licensing. The application{{nbsp}}{{mdash}} what users access to edit maps and view changelogs, is powered by [[Ruby on Rails]]. The application also uses [[PostgreSQL]] for storage of user data and edit metadata. The default map is rendered by [[Mapnik]], stored in [[PostGIS]], and powered by an [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]] module called ''mod_tile''. Certain parts of the software, such as the map editor [[Potlatch (software)|Potlatch2]], have been made available as [[public domain]].<ref name=\"osm-wiki-legalfaq\" />\n\n===Commercial data contributions===\nSome OpenStreetMap data is supplied by companies that choose to freely license either actual street data or satellite imagery sources from which OSM contributors can trace roads and features.\n\nNotably, [[Automotive Navigation Data]] provided a complete road data set for Netherlands and details of trunk roads in China and India. In December 2006, [[Yahoo!]] confirmed that OpenStreetMap was able to make use of their vertical aerial imagery and this photography was available within the editing software as an overlay. Contributors could create their vector based maps as a derived work, released with a [[free content license|free]] and [[open content license|open]] licence,<ref name=\"ogd-Coast1\" /> until the shutdown of the Yahoo! Maps API on 13 September 2011.<ref name=\"yahoo-maps-close\" /> In November 2010, [[Microsoft]] announced that the OpenStreetMap community could use Bing vertical aerial imagery as a backdrop in its editors.<ref name=\"ogd-Coast2\" /> For a period from 2009 to 2011, [[NearMap|NearMap Pty Ltd]] made their high-resolution PhotoMaps (of major Australian cities, plus some rural Australian areas) available for deriving OpenStreetMap data under a [[CC BY-SA]] licence.<ref name=\"nearmap\" />\n\nIn June 2018, the Microsoft Bing team announced a major contribution of 125 million U.S. building footprints to the project \u2013 four times the number contributed by users and government data imports.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.geospatialworld.net/blogs/microsoft-releases-building-footprints/|title=Microsoft releases more than 100 million Building Footprints in the US as open data|date=2018-07-03|work=Geospatial World|access-date=2018-09-11|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.bing.com/maps/2018-06/microsoft-releases-125-million-building-footprints-in-the-us-as-open-data|title=Microsoft Releases 125 million Building Footprints in the US as Open Data|website=blogs.bing.com|access-date=2018-09-11}}</ref>\n\n==Operation==\nWhile OpenStreetMap aims to be a central data source, its map rendering and aesthetics are meant to be only one of many options, some which highlight different elements of the map or emphasise design and performance.\n\n===Data format===\nOpenStreetMap uses a [[topology|topological]] [[graph (discrete mathematics)|data structure]], with four core elements (also known as ''data primitives''):\n* ''Nodes'' are points with a geographic position, stored as coordinates (pairs of a [[latitude]] and a [[longitude]]) according to [[WGS 84]].<ref>[https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/WGS_84 WGS 84] ''OpenStreetMap Wiki''</ref> Outside of their usage in ways, they are used to represent map features without a size, such as [[point of interest|points of interest]] or mountain peaks.\n* ''Ways'' are ordered lists of ''nodes'', representing a [[polyline]], or possibly a [[polygon]] if they form a closed loop. They are used both for representing linear features such as streets and rivers, and areas, like forests, parks, parking areas and lakes.\n* ''Relations'' are ordered lists of nodes, ways and relations (together called \"members\"), where each member can optionally have a \"role\" (a string). Relations are used for representing the relationship of existing nodes and ways. Examples include turn restrictions on roads, routes that span several existing ways (for instance, a long-distance motorway), and areas with holes.\n* ''[[Tag (metadata)|Tags]]'' are key-value pairs (both arbitrary strings). They are used to store [[metadata]] about the map objects (such as their type, their name and their physical properties). Tags are not free-standing, but are always attached to an object: to a node, a way or a relation. A recommended [[Ontology (computer science)|ontology]] of map features (the meaning of ''tags'') is [[openstreetmap:Map features|maintained on a wiki]]. New tagging schemes can always be proposed by a [[OpenStreetmap:Proposal process|popular vote of a written proposal]] in OpenStreetMap wiki, however, there is no requirement to follow this process. There are over 89 million different kinds of tags in use as of June 2017.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mocnik|first1=Franz-Benjamin|last2=Zipf|first2=Alexander|last3=Raifer|first3=Martin|title=The OpenStreetMap folksonomy and its evolution|journal=Geo-spatial Information Science|date=18 September 2017|volume=20|issue=3|pages=219\u2013230|doi=10.1080/10095020.2017.1368193|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n===Data storage===\nThe OSM data primitives are stored and processed in different formats.\n\nThe main copy of the OSM data is stored in OSM's main database. The main database is a [[PostgreSQL]] database with [[PostGIS]] extension, which has one table for each data primitive, with individual objects stored as rows.<ref>{{cite web |title=OpenStreetMap Wiki: Database |url=https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Database |website=OpenStreetMap |accessdate=10 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Databases_and_data_access_APIs |title=Databases and data access APIs |access-date=18 October 2017}}</ref> All edits happen in this database, and all other formats are created from it.\n\nFor data transfer, several database dumps are created, which are available for download. The complete dump is called [[Openstreetmap:planet.osm|planet.osm]]. These dumps exist in two formats, one using [[XML]] and one using the [[Protocol Buffers|Protocol Buffer Binary Format]] (PBF).\n\n=== Popular services ===\n\n[[Image:Moovit Navigate 3.0.png|thumb|upright|Moovit Navigate]]\n\nA variety of popular services incorporate some sort of [[geolocation]] or map-based component. Notable services using OSM for this include:\n\n* [[Apple Inc.]] unexpectedly created an OpenStreetMap-based map for [[IPhoto#iOS version|iPhoto for iOS]] on {{Start date|df=yes|2012|03|07}}, and launched the maps without properly citing the data source \u2013 though this was corrected in 1.0.1.
