Standing on a big platform in the middle of an empty room, while on the platform, Rowland poses in many different dance moves, before the song's verse begins. Then there is shots of chains around her face and body and then back-up dances are seen dancing in front of a screen, and later Rowland is seen dancing with the back-up dancers. Rowland is then seen again, with a top hat on, singing into the camera, while wearing a swimsuit.\n\n== Track listing ==\n*'''CD single'''<ref name=\"ger_cd\" />\n#\"Down for Whatever\" (Album Version) \u2013 3:55\n#\"Down for Whatever\" (Max Sanna & Steve Pitron Remix \u2013 Edit) \u2013 4:00\n\n*'''Digital download'''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/down-for-whatever-feat.-the/id473634457|title=Down for Whatever (feat.
