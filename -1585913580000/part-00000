The historiography of a specific topic covers how historians have studied that topic using particular sources, techniques, and theoretical approaches. Scholars discuss historiography by topic\u2014such as the [[historiography of the United Kingdom]], [[historiography of World War II|that of WWII]], [[historiography of the British Empire|the British Empire]], [[historiography of early Islam|early Islam]], and [[Chinese historiography|China]]\u2014and different approaches and genres, such as [[political history]] and [[social history]]. Beginning in the nineteenth century, with the development of [[academic history]], there developed a body of historiographic literature. The extent to which historians are influenced by their own groups and loyalties\u2014such as [[Nationalist historiography|to their nation state]]\u2014remains a debated question.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ferro, Marc|title=The Use and Abuse of History: Or How the Past Is Taught to Children|date=2003}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author1=Candelaria, John Lee |author2=Alporha, Veronica |year=2018 |title=Readings in Philippine History }}</ref>\n\nIn the [[ancient world]], chronological [[annal]]s were produced in civilizations such as [[ancient Egypt]] and [[Ancient Near East|Mesopotamia]]. However, the discipline of historiography was first established in the 5th century BC with the ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' of [[Herodotus]], the founder of [[Greek historiography]]. The [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] statesman [[Cato the Elder]] produced the first [[Roman historiography|history in Latin]], the ''[[Origines]]'', in the 2nd century BC. His near contemporaries [[Sima Tan]] and [[Sima Qian]] in the [[Han Empire]] of [[Ancient China|China]] established [[Chinese historiography]] with the compiling of the ''[[Shiji]]'' (''Records of the Grand Historian''). During the [[Middle Ages]], [[medieval historiography]] included the works of [[chronicle]]s in [[Medieval literature|medieval Europe]], [[Islamic literature|Islamic histories]] by [[Muslim historians]], and the [[Korean historiography|Korean]] and [[Japanese historiography|Japanese]] historical writings based on the existing Chinese model. During the 18th century [[Age of Enlightenment]], historiography in the Western world was shaped and developed by figures such as [[Voltaire]], [[David Hume]], and [[Edward Gibbon]], who among others set the foundations for the modern discipline.\n\nThe research interests of historians change over time, and there has been a shift away from traditional diplomatic, economic, and political history toward newer approaches, especially social and [[Postcolonialism|cultural studies]]. From 1975 to 1995 the proportion of professors of history in American universities identifying with social history increased from 31 to 41 percent, while the proportion of political historians decreased from 40 to 30 percent.<ref>Diplomatic dropped from 5% to 3%, economic history from 7% to 5%, and cultural history grew from 14% to 16%.

In that sense certain [[Official history|official historians]] were given the title \"[[Historiographer Royal]]\" in [[Rikshistoriograf|Sweden]] (from 1618), [[Historiographer Royal (England)|England]] (from 1660), and [[Historiographer Royal (Scotland)|Scotland]] (from 1681). The Scottish post is still in existence.\n\nHistoriography was more recently defined as \"the study of the way history has been and is written&nbsp;\u2013 the history of historical writing\", which means that, \"When you study 'historiography' you do not study the events of the past directly, but the changing interpretations of those events in the works of individual historians.\"<ref>{{cite book |first1=Conal |last1=Furay |first2= Michael J. |last2=Salevouris |title=The Methods and Skills of History: A Practical Guide |publisher=[[Harlan Davidson (publisher)|Harlan Davidson]]<!-- This was a family-owned higher educational publishing house that was started in 1976 by someone with the surname Davidson and was sold to John Wiley & Sons in 2012, according to an Article in Publisher's Weekly. -->  |year=1988 |page=223 |isbn=0-88295-982-4}})</ref>\n\n==Antiquity==\n{{see|Ancient history}}\nUnderstanding the past appears to be a universal human need, and the \"telling of history\" has emerged independently in civilizations around the world. \nWhat constitutes history is a philosophical question (see [[philosophy of history]]).\n\nThe earliest [[Chronology|chronologies]] date back to [[Mesopotamia]] and [[ancient Egypt]], in the form of [[chronicle]]s and [[annal]]s. However, no historical writers in these early civilizations were known by name. By contrast, the term \"historiography\" is taken to refer to written history recorded in a narrative format for the purpose of informing future generations about events. In this limited sense, \"ancient history\" begins with the early historiography of [[Classical Antiquity]], in about the 5th century BCE.\n\n===Europe===\n====Greece====\n{{main|Greek historiography}}\n{{further|Ancient Greek literature}}\n[[File:Thucydides Manuscript.jpg|thumb|upright|Reproduction of part of a tenth-century copy of [[Thucydides]]'s ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]''.]]\n\nThe earliest known systematic historical thought emerged in [[ancient Greece]], a development which would be an important influence on the writing of history elsewhere around [[History of the Mediterranean region|the Mediterranean]] region. Greek historians greatly contributed to the development of historical methodology. The earliest known critical historical works were ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]'', composed by [[Herodotus|Herodotus of Halicarnassus]] (484\u2013425 BCE) who became known as the \"father of history\".<ref>John L. Myres, ''Herodotus, Father of History'' (1953).</ref> Herodotus attempted to distinguish between more and less reliable accounts, and personally conducted research by travelling extensively, giving written accounts of various Mediterranean cultures. Although Herodotus' overall emphasis lay on the actions and characters of men, he also attributed an important role to divinity in the determination of historical events.\n\n[[File:Thucydides-bust-cutout ROM.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|left|Bust of Thucydides, Hellenistic copy of a 4th-century BC work]]\n\nThe generation following Herodotus witnessed a spate of local histories of the individual [[city-state]]s (''[[polis|poleis]]''), written by the first of the [[Local history|local historians]] who employed the written archives of city and sanctuary. [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] characterized these historians as the forerunners of Thucydides,<ref>Dionysius, ''On Thucydides'', 5.</ref> and these local histories continued to be written into [[Late Antiquity]], as long as the city-states survived. Two early figures stand out: [[Hippias of Elis]], who produced the lists of winners in the Olympic Games that provided the basic chronological framework as long as the pagan classical tradition lasted, and [[Hellanicus of Lesbos]], who compiled more than two dozen histories from civic records, all of them now lost.\n\n[[Thucydides]] largely eliminated divine causality in his account of the war between Athens and Sparta, establishing a rationalistic element which set a precedent for subsequent Western historical writings. He was also the first to distinguish between cause and immediate origins of an event, while his successor [[Xenophon]] ({{c.|lk=no|431}}&nbsp;\u2013 {{annum|355|BCE}}) introduced autobiographical elements and character studies in his ''[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]''.\n\nThe proverbial [[Philippic]] attacks of the Athenian orator [[Demosthenes]] ({{annum|384\u2013322|BCE}}) on [[Philip&nbsp;II of Macedon]] marked the height of ancient political agitation. The now lost history of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander's]] campaigns by the [[diadoch]] [[Ptolemy&nbsp;I]] ({{annum|367\u2013283|BCE}}) may represent the first historical work composed by a ruler. [[Polybius]] ({{c.|lk=no|203}}&nbsp;\u2013 {{annum|120|BCE}}) wrote on the rise of Rome to world prominence, and attempted to harmonize the Greek and Roman points of view.\n\nThe [[Chaldea]]n priest [[Berossus]] ({{annum|{{floruit|3rd century}}|BCE}}) composed a Greek-language ''History of [[Babylonia]]'' for the [[Seleucid]] king [[Antiochus&nbsp;I]], combining [[Hellenistic]] methods of historiography and [[Mesopotamia]]n accounts to form a unique composite. Reports exist of other near-eastern histories, such as that of the Phoenician historian [[Sanchuniathon]]; but he is considered semi-legendary and writings attributed to him are fragmentary, known only through the later historians [[Philo of Byblos]] and [[Eusebius]], who asserted that he wrote before even the [[Trojan war]].\n\n====Rome====\n{{Main|Roman historiography}}\n{{further|Latin literature}}\n[[File:Marco Porcio Caton Major.jpg|thumb|upright|The Roman [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] of historian [[Cato the Elder]]]]\n\n[[Ancient Romans|The Romans]] adopted the Greek tradition, writing at first in Greek, but eventually chronicling their history in a freshly non-Greek language. While early [[Roman literature|Roman works]] were still written in Greek, the ''Origines'', composed by the Roman statesman [[Cato the Elder]] ({{annum|234\u2013149|BCE}}), was written in Latin, in a conscious effort to counteract Greek cultural influence. It marked the beginning of Latin historical writings. Hailed for its lucid style, [[Julius Caesar]]'s ({{annum|100\u201344|BCE}}) ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico|de Bello Gallico]]'' exemplifies autobiographical war coverage. The politician and orator [[Cicero]] ({{annum|106\u201343|BCE}}) introduced rhetorical elements in his political writings.\n\n[[Strabo]] ({{annum|63|BCE}}&nbsp;\u2013 {{annum|{{c.|lk=no|24}}|[[Common Era|CE]]}}) was an important exponent of the [[Greco-Roman]] tradition of combining geography with history, presenting a descriptive history of peoples and places known to his era. [[Livy]] ({{annum|59|BCE}}&nbsp;\u2013 {{annum|17|CE}}) records the rise of [[Roman Empire|Rome]] from [[city-state]] to [[empire]]. His speculation about what would have happened if [[Alexander the Great]] had marched against Rome represents the first known instance of [[alternate history]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/txt/ah/Livy/Livy09.html |title=Livy's History of Rome: Book 9 |publisher=Mcadams.posc.mu.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-08-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070228233052/http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/txt/ah/Livy/Livy09.html |archive-date=2007-02-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nBiography, although popular throughout antiquity, was introduced as a branch of history by the works of [[Plutarch]] ({{c.|lk=no|46}}&nbsp;\u2013 {{annum|127|CE}}) and [[Suetonius]] ({{c.|lk=no|69}}&nbsp;\u2013 after {{annum|130|CE}}) who described the deeds and characters of ancient personalities, stressing their human side. [[Tacitus]] ({{annum|{{c.|lk=no|56|117}}|CE}}) denounces Roman immorality by praising [[Germanic peoples|German]] virtues, elaborating on the [[topos]] of the [[Noble savage]].\n\n===East Asia===\n====China====\n{{Main|Chinese historiography|Twenty-Four Histories}}\n{{further|Chinese literature}}\n[[File:Shiji.jpg|upright|thumb|First page of the ''[[Shiji]]''.]]\n\nThe Han dynasty eunuch [[Sima Qian]] (around {{annum|100|BCE}}) was the first in China to lay the groundwork for professional historical writing. His work superseded the older style of the ''[[Spring and Autumn Annals]]'', compiled in the 5th century BC, the ''[[Bamboo Annals]]'' and other court and dynastic [[annals]] that recorded history in a [[chronological]] form that abstained from [[analysis]]. Sima's ''[[Shiji]]'' (''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'') pioneered the \"Annals-biography\" format, which would become the standard for prestige history writing in China. In this genre a history opens with a chronological outline of court affairs, and then continues with detailed biographies of prominent people who lived during the period in question.<ref>Thomas R. Martin, ''Herodotus and Sima Qian: The First Great Historians of Greece and China: A Brief History with Documents'' (2009).</ref> The scope of his work extended as far back as the {{annum|16th century|BCE}}, and included many treatises on specific subjects and individual biographies of prominent people. He also explored the lives and deeds of commoners, both contemporary and those of previous eras.\n\nWhereas Sima's had been a universal history from the beginning of time down to the time of writing, his successor [[Ban Gu]] wrote an annals-biography history limiting its coverage to only the [[Western Han dynasty]], the [[Book of Han]] (96 CE). This established the notion of using dynastic boundaries as start- and end-points, and most later Chinese histories would focus on a single dynasty or group of dynasties.\n\nThe Records of the Grand Historian and Book of Han were eventually joined by the [[Book of the Later Han]] (488 CE) (replacing the earlier, and now only partially extant, Han Records from the Eastern Pavilion) and the [[Records of the Three Kingdoms]] (297 CE) to form the \"Four Histories\". These became mandatory reading for the [[Imperial Examinations]] and have therefore exerted an influence on Chinese culture comparable to the [[Thirteen Classics|Confucian Classics]]. More annals-biography histories were written in subsequent dynasties, eventually bringing the number to between twenty-four and twenty-six, but none ever reached the popularity and impact of the first four.<ref>Wilkinson 2018, pp. 692-695</ref>\n\nTraditional Chinese historiography describes history in terms of [[dynastic cycle]]s. In this view, each new dynasty is founded by a morally righteous founder. Over time, the dynasty becomes morally corrupt and dissolute. Eventually, the dynasty becomes so weak as to allow its replacement by a new dynasty.<ref>{{cite book|author=J\u00f6rn R\u00fcsen|title=Time and History: The Variety of Cultures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SvGyzu-nLaUC&pg=PA54|year=2007|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=978-1-84545-349-7|pages=54\u201355}}</ref>\n\nIn 281 CE the tomb of [[King Xiang of Wei]] (d. 296 BC) was opened, inside of which was found a historical text called the [[Bamboo Annals]], after the writing material. It is similar in style to the Spring and Autumn Annals and covers the time from the [[Yellow Emperor]] to 299 BC. Opinions on the authenticity of the text has varied throughout the centuries, and in any event it was re-discovered too late to gain anything like the same status as the Spring and Autumn.<ref>Wilkinson, Endymion.

In the [[Early Christianity|first Christian centuries]], the [[Development of the New Testament canon|New Testament canon was developed]]. The [[Early centers of Christianity|growth of Christianity]] and its enhanced status in the Roman Empire after [[Constantine I and Christianity|Constantine&nbsp;I]] (see [[State church of the Roman Empire]]) led to the development of a distinct Christian historiography, influenced by both [[Christian theology]] and the nature of the [[Christian Bible]], encompassing new areas of study and views of history.  The central role of the Bible in Christianity is reflected in the preference of Christian historians for written sources, compared to the classical historians' preference for oral sources and is also reflected in the inclusion of politically unimportant people. Christian historians also focused on development of religion and society.  This can be seen in the extensive inclusion of written sources in the ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Ecclesiastical History]]'' written by [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] around 324 and in the subjects it covers.<ref name=\"sxixkf\">[http://www.cuw.edu/Academics/programs/history/historiography.html ''Historiography''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018032745/http://www.cuw.edu/Academics/programs/history/historiography.html |date=2007-10-18 }}, Concordia University Wisconsin, retrieved on 2 November 2007</ref>  Christian theology considered time as linear, progressing according to divine plan.  As God's plan encompassed everyone, Christian histories in this period had a universal approach. For example, Christian writers often included summaries of important historical events prior to the period covered by the work.<ref>Warren, John (1998).

They wrote about the history of Jesus Christ, that of the Church and that of their patrons, the dynastic history of the local rulers.  In the [[early medieval|Early Middle Ages]] historical writing often took the form of [[annals]] or [[chronicle]]s recording events year by year, but this style tended to hamper the analysis of events and causes.<ref>Warren, John (1998). ''The past and its presenters: an introduction to issues in historiography'', Hodder & Stoughton, {{ISBN|0-340-67934-4}}, pp. 78\u201379.</ref> An example of this type of writing is the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', which was the work of several different writers: it was started during the reign of [[Alfred the Great]] in the late 9th&nbsp;century, but one copy was still being updated in 1154.  Some writers in the period did construct a more [[narrative]] form of history. These included [[Gregory of Tours]] and more successfully [[Bede]], who wrote both [[secular]] and [[ecclesiastical]] history and who is known for writing the ''[[Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]''.<ref name = \"sxixkf\"/>\n\nDuring the [[Renaissance]], history was written about states or nations. The study of history changed during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and [[Romanticism]]. [[Voltaire]] described the history of certain ages that he considered important, rather than describing events in chronological order. History became an independent discipline. It was not called ''philosophia historiae'' anymore, but merely history (''historia'').\n\n[[File:Ibn khaldun writting-ms.jpg|thumb|upright|Autograph writing of [[Ibn Khaldun]], pioneer of historiography, [[cultural history]], and the [[philosophy of history]].]]\n\n===Islamic world===\n{{See also|Historiography of early Islam|Muqaddimah|Muslim historians}}\n\n[[Muslim]] historical writings first began to develop in the 7th century, with the reconstruction of the Prophet [[Muhammad]]'s life in the centuries following his death. With numerous conflicting narratives regarding Muhammad and his [[Sahaba|companions]] from various sources, it was necessary to verify which sources were more reliable. In order to evaluate these sources, various methodologies were developed, such as the \"[[Ilm ar-Rijal|science of biography]]\", \"[[science of hadith]]\" and \"[[Isnad]]\" (chain of transmission). These methodologies were later applied to other historical figures in the [[Islamic Golden Age|Islamic civilization]]. Famous historians in this tradition include [[Urwah ibn Zubayr|Urwah]] (d.&nbsp;712), [[Wahb ibn Munabbih]] (d.&nbsp;728), [[Ibn Ishaq]] (d.&nbsp;761), [[al-Waqidi]] (745\u2013822), [[Ibn Hisham]] (d.&nbsp;834), [[Muhammad al-Bukhari]] (810\u2013870) and [[Ibn Hajar Asqalani|Ibn Hajar]] (1372\u20131449).<ref>Chase F.

Among the many Italians who contributed to this were [[Leonardo Bruni]] (c. 1370\u20131444), [[Francesco Guicciardini]] (1483\u20131540), and [[Caesar Baronius|Cesare Baronio]] (1538\u20131607).\n\n===Voltaire===\nFrench ''[[Philosophes|philosophe]]'' [[Voltaire]] (1694\u20131778) had an enormous influence on the development of historiography during the Age of Enlightenment through his demonstration of fresh new ways to look at the past. Guillaume de Syon argues:\n:Voltaire recast historiography in both factual and analytical terms. Not only did he reject traditional biographies and accounts that claim the work of supernatural forces, but he went so far as to suggest that earlier historiography was rife with falsified evidence and required new investigations at the source. Such an outlook was not unique in that the scientific spirit that 18th-century intellectuals perceived themselves as invested with. A rationalistic approach was key to rewriting history.<ref>Guillaume de Syon, \"Voltaire,\" in {{cite book|author=Kelly Boyd. ed.|title=Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing, vol 2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0121vD9STIMC&pg=PA1270|date=1999|publisher=Taylor & Francis|pages=1270\u201372|isbn=9781884964336}}</ref>\n\nVoltaire's best-known histories are ''[[The Age of Louis XIV]]'' (1751), and his ''[[Essai sur les m\u0153urs et l'esprit des nations|Essay on the Customs and the Spirit of the Nations]]'' (1756). He broke from the tradition of narrating diplomatic and military events, and emphasized customs, social history and achievements in the arts and sciences. He was the first scholar to make a serious attempt to write the history of the world, eliminating theological frameworks, and emphasizing economics, culture and political history. Although he repeatedly warned against political bias on the part of the historian, he did not miss many opportunities to expose the intolerance and frauds of the church over the ages. Voltaire advised scholars that anything contradicting the normal course of nature was not to be believed. Although he found evil in the historical record, he fervently believed reason and educating the illiterate masses would lead to progress.\n\nVoltaire explains his view of historiography in his article on \"History\" in Diderot's ''[[Encyclop\u00e9die]]'': ''\"One demands of modern historians more details, better ascertained facts, precise dates, more attention to customs, laws, mores, commerce, finance, agriculture, population.\"'' Already in 1739 he had written: ''\"My chief object is not political or military history, it is the history of the arts, of commerce, of civilization&nbsp;\u2013 in a word,&nbsp;\u2013 of the human mind.\"''<ref>{{cite book|author=E.

In 1754 he published ''[[The History of England (David Hume)|The History of England]]'', a 6-volume work which extended \"From the Invasion of Julius Caesar to the Revolution in 1688\". Hume adopted a similar scope to Voltaire in his history; as well as the history of Kings, Parliaments, and armies, he examined the history of culture, including literature and science, as well. His short biographies of leading scientists explored the process of scientific change and he developed new ways of seeing scientists in the context of their times by looking at how they interacted with society and each other&nbsp;\u2013 he paid special attention to [[Francis Bacon]], [[Robert Boyle]], [[Isaac Newton]] and [[William Harvey]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wertz | first1 = S.

Rosenberg, ''Carlyle and the Burden of History''  (1985).</ref> Carlyle's style of historical writing stressed the immediacy of action, often using the present tense.  He emphasised the role of forces of the spirit in history and thought that chaotic events demanded what he called 'heroes' to take control over the competing forces erupting within society. He considered the dynamic forces of history as being the hopes and aspirations of people that took the form of ideas, and were often ossified into ideologies. Carlyle's ''The French Revolution'' was written in a highly unorthodox style, far removed from the neutral and detached tone of the tradition of Gibbon. Carlyle presented the history as dramatic events unfolding in the present as though he and the reader were participants on the streets of Paris at the famous events.  Carlyle's invented style was epic poetry combined with philosophical treatise. It is rarely read or cited in the last century.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cobban | first1 = Alfred | year = 1963 | title = Carlyle's French Revolution | url = | journal = History | volume = 48 | issue = 164| pages = 306\u201316 }}</ref><ref>Mark Cumming, ''A Disimprisoned Epic: Form and Vision in Carlyle's French Revolution'' (1988).</ref>\n\n===French historians: Michelet and Taine===\n[[File:Jules Michelet portrait older.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Jules Michelet (1798\u20131874), later in his career.]]\n[[File:Hippolyte taine.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Hippolyte Taine (1828\u20131893)]]\n\nIn his main work ''Histoire de France'' (1855), French historian [[Jules Michelet]] (1798\u20131874) coined the term [[Renaissance]] (meaning \"rebirth\" in [[French language|French]]), as a period in Europe's cultural history that represented a break from the Middle Ages, creating a modern understanding of humanity and its place in the world.<ref>{{cite book|authorlink1=Jerry Brotton|last=Brotton|first=Jerry|title=The Renaissance Bazaar|year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=21\u201322}}</ref> The 19-volume work covered French history from [[Charlemagne]] to the outbreak of the [[French Revolution]].

He had a decisive impact on scholars. Gayana Jurkevich argues that led by Michelet:\n:19th-century French historians no longer saw history as the chronicling of royal dynasties, armies, treaties, and great men of state, but as the history of ordinary French people and the landscape of France.<ref>{{cite book|author=Gayana Jurkevich|title=In Pursuit of the Natural Sign|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-mV6wNgmwT4C&pg=PA42|year=1999|page=42|isbn=9780838754139}}</ref>\n\n[[Hippolyte Taine]] (1828\u20131893), although unable to secure an academic position, was the chief theoretical influence of French [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalism]], a major proponent of [[sociological positivism]], and one of the first practitioners of [[Historicism|historicist]] criticism.

According to [[John Lukacs]], he was the first master of cultural history, which seeks to describe the spirit and the forms of expression of a particular age, a particular people, or a particular place.  His innovative approach to historical research stressed the importance of art and its inestimable value as a primary source for the study of history. He was one of the first historians to rise above the narrow nineteenth-century notion that \"history is past politics and politics current history.<ref>John Lukacs, Remembered Past: John Lukacs on History, Historians, and Historical Knowledge, ed.

Nelson, Wilmington, DE: ISI Books, 2004, p. 215.</ref>\n\nBy the mid-19th century, scholars were beginning to analyse the history of institutional change, particularly the development of constitutional government. [[William Stubbs]]'s  ''Constitutional History of England'' (3 vols., 1874\u201378) was an important influence on this developing field. The work traced the development of the English constitution from the Teutonic invasions of Britain until 1485, and marked a distinct step in the advance of English historical learning.<ref>[[s:A Short Biographical Dictionary of English Literature/Stubbs, William]]</ref> He argued that the theory of the unity and continuity of history should not remove distinctions between ancient and modern history. He believed that, though work on ancient history is a useful preparation for the study of modern history, either may advantageously be studied apart. He was a good [[palaeography|palaeographer]], and excelled in textual criticism, in examination of authorship, and other such matters, while his vast erudition and retentive memory made him second to none in interpretation and exposition.<ref>Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (11th ed.)</ref>\n\n===Von Ranke and professionalization in Germany===\n{{main|Historiography of Germany}}\n[[File:Leopold Von Ranke 1877.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Leopold von Ranke|Ranke]] established history as a professional academic discipline in Germany.]]\n\nThe modern academic study of history and methods of historiography were pioneered in 19th-century German universities, especially the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]]. [[Leopold von Ranke]] (1795\u20131886) at Berlin was a pivotal influence in this regard, and was the founder of modern source-based history.<ref>Frederick C.

[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2504333 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nSpecifically, he implemented the seminar teaching method in his classroom, and focused on archival research and analysis of historical documents. Beginning with his first book in 1824, the ''History of the Latin and Teutonic Peoples from 1494 to 1514'', Ranke used an unusually wide variety of sources for a historian of the age, including \"memoirs, diaries, personal and formal missives, government documents, diplomatic dispatches and first-hand accounts of eye-witnesses\". Over a career that spanned much of the century, Ranke set the standards for much of later historical writing, introducing such ideas as reliance on [[primary source]]s, an emphasis on [[narrative history]] and especially international politics (''aussenpolitik'').<ref>E. Sreedharan, ''A textbook of historiography, 500&nbsp;BC to AD&nbsp;2000'' (2004) p. 185</ref>  Sources had to be solid, not speculations and rationalizations. His credo was to write history the way it was. He insisted on primary sources with proven authenticity.\n\nRanke also rejected the 'teleological approach' to history, which traditionally viewed each period as inferior to the period which follows. In Ranke's view, the historian had to understand a period on its own terms, and seek to find only the general ideas which animated every period of history. In 1831 and at the behest of the [[Prussia]]n government, Ranke founded and edited the first historical journal in the world, called ''Historisch-Politische Zeitschrift''.\n\nAnother important German thinker was [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], whose theory of historical progress ran counter to Ranke's approach. In Hegel's own words, his philosophical theory of \"World history... represents the development of the spirit's consciousness of its own [[Freedom of will|freedom]] and of the consequent realization of this freedom.\".<ref>''Lectures'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=pjfaimuprzoC&pg=PA138&hl=en&dq=%22represents+the+development+of+the+spirit's+consciousness+of+its+own+freedom+and+of+the+consequent+realisation+of+this+freedom.%22 p. 138].</ref> This realization is seen by studying the various cultures that have developed over the millennia, and trying to understand the way that freedom has worked itself out through them:\n\n<blockquote>World history is the record of the spirit's efforts to attain knowledge of what it is in itself. The Orientals do not know that the spirit or man as such are free in themselves. And because they do not know that, they are not themselves free. They only know that '''One''' is free.... The consciousness of freedom first awoke among the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], and they were accordingly free; but, like the Romans, they only knew that '''Some''', and not all men as such, are free.... The [[Germans#Middle Ages|Germanic nations]], with the rise of [[Christianity]], were the first to realize that '''All''' men are by nature free, and that freedom of spirit is his very essence.<ref>''Lectures'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=pjfaimuprzoC&pg=PA54&hl=en&dq=%22World+history+is+the+record+of+the+spirit's+efforts+to+attain+knowledge+of+what+it+is+in+itself.+The+Orientals+do+not+know+that+the+spirit+or+man+as+such+are+free+in+themselves.+And+because+they+do+not+know+that,+they+are+not+themselves+free.+They+only+know+that+One+is+free.%22%22The+consciousness+of+freedom+first+awoke+among+the+Greeks,+and+they+were+accordingly+free;+but,+like+the+Romans,+they+only+knew+that+Some,+and+not+all+men+as+such,+are+free%22%22The+Germanic+nations,+with+the+rise+of+Christianity,+were+the+first+to+realize+that+All+men+are+by+nature+free,+and+that+freedom+of+spirit+is+his+very+essence.%22 p. 54].</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n[[Karl Marx]] introduced the concept of [[historical materialism]] into the study of world historical development. In his conception, the economic conditions and dominant modes of production determined the structure of society at that point. In his view five successive stages in the development of material conditions would occur in [[Western Europe]]. The first stage was [[primitive communism]] where property was shared and there was no concept of \"leadership\". This progressed to a [[Slavery|slave society]] where the idea of [[Social class|class]] emerged and the [[State (polity)|State]] developed. [[Feudalism]] was characterized by an [[aristocracy]] working in partnership with a [[theocracy]] and the emergence of the [[Nation-state]]. [[Capitalism]] appeared after the bourgeois revolution when the capitalists (or their merchant predecessors) overthrew the feudal system and established a [[market economy]], with\n[[private property]] and [[Parliamentary democracy]]. Marx then predicted the eventual proletarian revolution that would result in the attainment of [[socialism]], followed by [[Communism]], where property would be communally owned.\n\nPrevious historians had focused on cyclical events of the rise and decline of rulers and nations.

His writings are famous for their ringing prose and for their confident, sometimes dogmatic, emphasis on a progressive model of British history, according to which the country threw off superstition, autocracy and confusion to create a balanced constitution and a forward-looking culture combined with freedom of belief and expression. This model of human progress has been called the [[Whig history|Whig interpretation of history]].<ref>John Clive, ''Macaulay \u2013 the shaping of the historian'' (1975)</ref> He published the first volumes of his most famous work of history, ''[[The History of England from the Accession of James II]]'', in 1848.

The school emphasized the use of quantification and the paying of special attention to geography.<ref>See Lucien Febvre, ''La Terre et l'\u00e9volution humaine'' (1922), translated as ''A Geographical Introduction to History'' (London, 1932).</ref><ref>See [http://www.editions.ehess.fr/revues/annales-histoire-sciences-sociales/numeros-parus/ for recent issues]</ref>\n\nThe ''Annales d'histoire \u00e9conomique et sociale'' journal was founded in 1929 in [[Strasbourg]] by [[Marc Bloch]] and [[Lucien Febvre]]. These authors, the former a medieval historian and the latter an early modernist, quickly became associated with the distinctive ''Annales'' approach, which combined geography, history, and the sociological approaches of the [[Ann\u00e9e Sociologique]] (many members of which were their colleagues at Strasbourg) to produce an approach which rejected the predominant emphasis on politics, diplomacy and war of many 19th and early 20th-century historians as spearheaded by historians whom Febvre called Les Sorbonnistes. Instead, they pioneered an approach to a study of long-term historical structures (''la [[longue dur\u00e9e]]'') over events and political transformations.<ref>Colin Jones, \"Olwen Hufton's 'Poor', Richard Cobb's 'People', and the Notions of the longue dur\u00e9e in French Revolutionary Historiography\", ''Past & Present'', 2006 Supplement (Volume 1), pp. 178\u2013203 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/past_and_present/v2006/2006.1Sjones.html in Project Muse]</ref>  Geography, material culture, and what later Annalistes called ''mentalit\u00e9s'', or the psychology of the epoch, are also characteristic areas of study. The goal of the ''Annales'' was to undo the work of the ''Sorbonnistes'', to turn French historians away from the narrowly political and diplomatic toward the new vistas in social and economic history.<ref>J.H.

Braudel developed the idea, often associated with Annalistes, of different modes of historical time: ''l'histoire quasi immobile'' (motionless history) of historical geography, the history of social, political and economic structures (''la [[longue dur\u00e9e]]''), and the history of men and events, in the context of their structures. His 'longue dur\u00e9e' approach stressed slow, and often imperceptible effects of space, climate and technology on the actions of human beings in the past.  The ''Annales'' historians, after living through two world wars and major political upheavals in France, were deeply uncomfortable with the notion that multiple ruptures and discontinuities created history. They preferred to stress slow change and the longue dur\u00e9e. They paid special attention to geography, climate, and demography as long-term factors. They considered the continuities of the deepest structures were central to history, beside which upheavals in institutions or the superstructure of social life were of little significance, for history lies beyond the reach of conscious actors, especially the will of revolutionaries.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Olivia |last=Harris |title=Braudel: Historical Time and the Horror of Discontinuity |journal=[[History Workshop Journal]] |year=2004 |volume=57 |pages=161\u2013174 |issn=1363-3554 |url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/849/ |doi=10.1093/hwj/57.1.161 |citeseerx=10.1.1.693.9898 }} Only Ari\u00e8s was a true conservative\u2014indeed a royalist.</ref>\n\nNoting the political upheavals in Europe and especially in France in 1968, [[Eric Hobsbawm]] argued that \"in France the virtual hegemony of Braudelian history and the ''Annales'' came to an end after 1968, and the international influence of the journal dropped steeply.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Eric J.

Scholars moved in multiple directions, covering in disconnected fashion the social, economic, and cultural history of different eras and different parts of the globe. By the time of crisis the school was building a vast publishing and research network reaching across France, Europe, and the rest of the world. Influence indeed spread out from Paris, but few new ideas came in. Much emphasis was given to quantitative data, seen as the key to unlocking all of social history.<ref>One of numerous spin-off journals was ''Histoire & mesure'' (1986\u2014), devoted to quantitative history.</ref>  However, the ''Annales'' ignored the developments in quantitative studies underway in the U.S. and Britain, which reshaped economic, political and demographic research.<ref>Georg G.

[[Friedrich Engels]] wrote ''[[The Peasant War in Germany]]'', which analysed social warfare in early Protestant Germany in terms of emerging capitalist classes. Although it lacked a rigorous engagement with archival sources, it indicated an early interest in [[People's history|history from below]] and class analysis, and it attempts a dialectical analysis. Another treatise of Engels, ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]'', was salient in creating the [[socialist]] impetus in British politics from then on, e.g. the [[Fabian Society]].\n\n[[R. H. Tawney]] was an early historian working in this tradition. ''The Agrarian Problem in the Sixteenth Century'' (1912)<ref>[[William Rose Ben\u00e9t]] (1988) p.&nbsp;961</ref> and ''Religion and the Rise of Capitalism'' (1926), reflected his ethical concerns and preoccupations in economic history. He was profoundly interested in the issue of the enclosure of land in the English countryside in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and in [[Max Weber]]'s thesis on the connection between the appearance of [[Protestantism]] and the rise of capitalism. His belief in the rise of the gentry in the century before the outbreak of the Civil War in England provoked the 'Storm over the Gentry' in which his methods were subjected to severe criticisms by [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]] and John Cooper.\n\n[[Historiography in the Soviet Union]] was greatly influenced by Marxist historiography, as [[historical materialism]] was extended into the Soviet version of [[dialectical materialism]].\n\nA circle of historians inside the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] (CPGB) formed in 1946 and became a highly influential cluster of [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Marxist historiography|Marxist historians]], who contributed to [[history from below]] and class structure in early capitalist society. While some members of the group (most notably [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]] and [[E. P. Thompson]]) left the CPGB after the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution]], the common points of British Marxist historiography continued in their works. They placed a great emphasis on the subjective determination of history.\n\nChristopher Hill's studies on 17th-century English history were widely acknowledged and recognised as representative of this school.<ref name=\"Oxford DNB\">{{cite ODNB|title=Hill, (John Edward) Christopher (1912\u20132003)|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/89437|accessdate=29 June 2012|date=January 2007|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/89437}}</ref> His books include ''Puritanism and Revolution'' (1958), ''Intellectual Origins of the English Revolution'' (1965 and revised in 1996), ''The Century of Revolution'' (1961), ''AntiChrist in 17th-century England'' (1971), ''The World Turned Upside Down'' (1972) and many others.\n\n[[E. P. Thompson]] pioneered the study of history from below in his work, ''[[The Making of the English Working Class]]'', published in 1963. It focused on the forgotten history of the first working-class political left in the world in the late-18th and early-19th centuries. In his preface to this book, Thompson set out his approach to writing history from below:\n\n{{quote|text=I am seeking to rescue the poor stockinger, the [[Luddite]] cropper, the \"obsolete\" hand-loom weaver, the \"Utopian\" artisan, and even the deluded follower of [[Joanna Southcott]], from the enormous condescension of posterity. Their crafts and traditions may have been dying. Their hostility to the new industrialism may have been backward-looking. Their communitarian ideals may have been fantasies. Their insurrectionary conspiracies may have been foolhardy. But they lived through these times of acute social disturbance, and we did not. Their aspirations were valid in terms of their own experience; and, if they were casualties of history, they remain, condemned in their own lives, as casualties.}}\n\nThompson's work was also significant because of the way he defined \"class\". He argued that class was not a structure, but a relationship that changed over time. He opened the gates for a generation of labor historians, such as [[David Montgomery (historian)|David Montgomery]] and [[Herbert Gutman]], who made similar studies of the American working classes.\n\nOther important Marxist historians included [[Eric Hobsbawm]], [[C. L. R. James]], [[Raphael Samuel]], [[A. L. Morton]] and [[Brian Pearce]].\n\nAlthough Marxist historiography made important contributions to the history of the [[working class]], oppressed nationalities, and the [[methodology]] of [[People's history|history from below]], its chief problematic aspect was its argument on the nature of history as ''determined'' or ''dialectical''; this can also be stated as the relative importance of subjective and objective factors in creating outcomes. It increasingly fell out of favour in the 1960s and '70s. [[Geoffrey Elton]] was important in undermining the case for a [[Marxist historiography]], which he argued was presenting seriously flawed interpretations of the past. In particular, Elton was opposed to the idea that the [[English Civil War]] was caused by socioeconomic changes in the 16th and 17th centuries, arguing instead that it was due largely to the incompetence of the [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] kings.<ref>See his essays 'The Stuart Century', 'A High Road to Civil War?' and 'The Unexplained Revolution' in G. R. Elton, ''Studies in Tudor and Stuart Politics and Government: Volume II'' (Cambridge University Press, 1974).</ref>\n\nIn dealing with the era of the [[Second World War]], Addison notes that in Britain by the 1990s, labour history was, \"in sharp decline\", because:\n{{quote|there was no longer much interest in history of the white, male working-class.  Instead the 'cultural turn' encouraged historians to explore wartime constructions of gender, race, citizenship and national identity.<ref>Paul Addison and Harriet Jones, eds.

It is a field especially attractive to nonacademic historians, and often to the spouses or children of famous people, who have access to the trove of letters and documents. Academic historians tend to downplay biography because it pays too little attention to broad social, cultural, political and economic forces, and perhaps too much attention to popular psychology. The \"[[Great man theory|Great Man]]\" tradition in Britain originated in the multi-volume ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' (which originated in 1882 and issued updates into the 1970s); it continues to this day in the new ''[[Dictionary of National Biography|Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'.' In the United States, the ''[[Dictionary of American Biography]]'' was planned in the late 1920s and appeared with numerous supplements into the 1980s.  It has now been displaced by the ''[[American National Biography]]'' as well as numerous smaller historical encyclopedias that give thorough coverage to Great Persons. Bookstores do a thriving business in biographies, which sell far more copies than the esoteric monographs based on post-structuralism, cultural, racial or gender history. [[Michael Holroyd]] says the last forty years \"may be seen as a golden age of biography\", but nevertheless calls it the \"shallow end of history\". Nicolas Barker argues that \"more and more biographies command an ever larger readership\", as he speculates that biography has come \"to express the spirit of our age\".<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Riall | first1 = Lucy | year = 2010 | title = The Shallow End of History?

Meister argues that:\n{{quote|Biography Studies is emerging as an independent discipline, especially in the Netherlands. This Dutch School of biography is moving biography studies away from the less scholarly life writing tradition and towards history by encouraging its practitioners to utilize an approach adapted from microhistory.<ref>Daniel R.

G. Collingwood]]'s idealism, and rejected the empirical view of the historian's work being an accretion of \"facts\" that they have at their disposal as nonsense.  He maintained that there is such a vast quantity of information that the historian always chooses the \"facts\" they decide to make use of. In Carr's famous example, he claimed that millions had crossed the Rubicon, but only Julius Caesar's crossing in 49 BC is declared noteworthy by historians.<ref name=\"Huges-Warrington, Marnie p. 26\">Huges-Warrington, p. 26</ref><ref>Carr, ''What Is History?'', p. 10;</ref> For this reason, Carr argued that [[Leopold von Ranke]]'s famous dictum ''wie es eigentlich gewesen'' (show what actually happened) was wrong because it presumed that the \"facts\" influenced what the historian wrote, rather than the historian choosing what \"facts of the past\" they intended to turn into \"historical facts\".<ref>Carr, ''What Is History?'', pp. 8\u201313</ref> At the same time, Carr argued that the study of the facts may lead the historian to change his or her views.  In this way, Carr argued that history was \"an unending dialogue between the past and present\".<ref name=\"Huges-Warrington, Marnie p. 26\"/><ref>Carr, ''What Is History?'', p. 30</ref>\n\nCarr is held by some critics to have had a deterministic outlook in history.<ref name=\"Huges-Warrington, Marnie p. 27\">Huges-Warrington, p. 27. One of his first and most influential critics was the British philosopher, Michael Oakeshott, 'What is History?' (1961), in idem, ''What is History and Other Essays'' (Exeter, 2004), 325.</ref> Others have modified or rejected this use of the label \"determinist\".<ref>See M. Hewitson, ''History and Causality'' (Basingstoke, 2014), pp. 86\u201393.</ref> He took a hostile view of those historians who stress the workings of chance and contingency in the workings of history. In Carr's view, no individual is truly free of the social environment in which they live, but contended that within those limitations, there was room, albeit very narrow room for people to make decisions that affect history.  Carr emphatically contended that history was a [[Social sciences|social science]], not an [[The arts|art]],<ref name=HW28>Huges-Warrington, p. 28</ref> because historians like scientists seek generalizations that helped to broaden the understanding of one's subject.<ref name=HW28/><ref>Carr, ''What Is History?'', p. 62</ref>\n\nOne of Carr's most forthright critics was [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]], who argued that Carr's dismissal of the \"might-have-beens of history\" reflected a fundamental lack of interest in examining historical causation.<ref>Trevor-Roper, pp. 72\u201373</ref> Trevor-Roper asserted that examining possible alternative outcomes of history was far from being a \"parlour-game\" was rather an essential part of the historians' work,<ref name=\"Trevor-Roper p. 73\">Trevor-Roper, p. 73</ref> as only by considering all possible outcomes of a given situation could a historian properly understand the period.\n\nThe controversy inspired Sir [[Geoffrey Elton]] to write his 1967 book ''The Practice of History''. Elton criticized Carr for his \"whimsical\" distinction between the \"historical facts\" and the \"facts of the past\", arguing that it reflected \"...an extraordinarily arrogant attitude both to the past and to the place of the historian studying it\".<ref>Elton, Geoffrey ''The Practice of History'', London: Methuen, 1967 pp. 56\u201357</ref> Elton, instead, strongly defended the traditional methods of history and was also appalled by the inroads made by [[postmodernism]].<ref>\u00d3 Tuathaigh, M. A. G., \u2018Irish Historical \", Revisionism\": State of the Art of Ideological Project?\u2019 in, Brady, Ciaran (ed.), Interpreting Irish History (Dublin, 2006), p. 325.</ref> Elton saw the duty of historians as empirically gathering evidence and objectively analyzing what the evidence has to say. As a traditionalist, he placed great emphasis on the role of individuals in history instead of abstract, impersonal forces. Elton saw political history as the highest kind of history. Elton had no use for those who seek history to make myths, to create laws to explain the past, or to produce theories such as [[Marxism]].\n\n===U.S. approaches===\n{{main|Historiography of the United States}}\nClassical and European history was part of the 19th-century grammar curriculum.

Instead, they proclaimed it was a:\n:social cataclysm in which the capitalists, laborers, and farmers of the North and West drove from power in the national government the planting aristocracy of the South. Viewed under the light of universal history, the fighting was a fleeting incident; the social revolution was the essential portentous outcome....

Schlesinger made Jackson a hero for his successful attacks on the [[Second Bank of the United States]]. His own views were clear enough: \"Moved typically by personal and class, rarely by public, considerations, the business community has invariably brought national affairs to a state of crisis and exasperated the rest of society into dissatisfaction bordering on revolt.\"<ref>Schlesinger, ''Age of Jackson'' (1945) p 521.</ref>\n\n====Consensus history====\n{{main|Consensus history}}\nConsensus history emphasizes the basic unity of American values and downplays conflict as superficial.

The goal was to incorporate in historical studies perspectives from all the social sciences, especially political science, sociology and economics. The pioneers shared a commitment to quantification. However, by the 1980s the first blush of quantification had worn off, as traditional historians counterattacked. [[Harvey J. Graff]] says:\n{{quote|The case against the new mixed and confused a lengthy list of ingredients, including the following: history\u2019s supposed loss of identity and humanity in the stain of social science, the fear of subordinating quality to quantity, conceptual and technical fallacies, violation of the literary character and biographical base of \", good\" history (rhetorical and aesthetic concern), loss of audiences, derogation of history rooted in \", great men\" and \", great events\", trivialization in general, a hodge-podge of ideological objections from all directions, and a fear that new historians were reaping research funds that might otherwise come to their detractors.

Another standard division within the historiography is the temporal factor, with works falling into either the early modern period (or \u201ccolonial era\u201d) or the post-independence (or \u201cnational\u201d) period, from the early nineteenth onward. Relatively few works span the two eras and few works except textbooks unite Spanish America and Brazil. There is a tendency to focus on histories of particular countries or regions (the Andes, the Southern Cone, the Caribbean) with relatively little comparative work.\n\nHistorians of Latin America have contributed to various types of historical writing, but one major, innovative development in Spanish American history is the emergence of [[ethnohistory]], the history of indigenous peoples, especially in Mexico based on alphabetic sources in Spanish or in [[New Philology|indigenous languages]].<ref>Howard F.

It focused on the examination of history from a global perspective and looked for common patterns that emerged across all cultures. The basic thematic approach of this field was to analyse two major focal points: [[syncretism|integration]]&nbsp;\u2013 (how processes of world history have drawn people of the world together), and difference&nbsp;\u2013 (how patterns of world history reveal the diversity of the human experience).\n\n[[Arnold J. Toynbee]]'s ten-volume ''[[A Study of History]]'', took an approach that was widely discussed in the 1930s and 1940s. By the 1960s his work was virtually ignored by scholars and the general public.  He compared 26 independent civilizations and argued that they displayed striking parallels in their origin, growth, and decay.  He proposed a universal model to each of these civilizations, detailing the stages through which they all pass: genesis, growth, time of troubles, universal state, and disintegration. The later volumes gave too much emphasis on spirituality to satisfy critics.<ref>William H. McNeill, ''Arnold J. Toynbee a Life'' (1989)</ref>\n\nChicago historian [[William Hardy McNeill|William H. McNeill]] wrote ''[[The Rise of the West]]'' (1965) to show how the separate civilizations of Eurasia interacted from the very beginning of their history, borrowing critical skills from one another, and thus precipitating still further change as adjustment between traditional old and borrowed new knowledge and practice became necessary. He then discusses the dramatic effect of [[Western culture|Western civilization]] on others in the past 500 years of history. McNeill took a broad approach organized around the interactions of peoples across the globe. Such interactions have become both more numerous and more continual and substantial in recent times. Before about 1500, the network of communication between cultures was that of Eurasia. The term for these areas of interaction differ from one world historian to another and include ''world-system'' and ''ecumene.'' His emphasis on cultural fusions influenced historical theory significantly.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = McNeill | first1 = William H. | year = 1995 | title = The Changing Shape of World History | url = | journal = History and Theory | volume = 34 | issue = 2| pages = 8\u201326 }}</ref>\n\n===The cultural turn===\nThe \"cultural turn\" of the 1980s and 1990s affected scholars in most areas of history.<ref>It missed some areas. {{cite journal | last1 = Martin | first1 = Kevin W. | year = 2014 | title = Middle East Historiography: Did We Miss the Cultural Turn? | url = | journal = History Compass | volume = 12 | issue = 2| pages = 178\u2013186 }}</ref>  Inspired largely by anthropology, it turned away from leaders, ordinary people and famous events to look at the use of language and cultural symbols to represent the changing values of society.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Grigor Suny | first1 = Ronald | year = 2002 | title = Back and Beyond: Reversing the Cultural Turn? | url = https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/532855 | journal = American Historical Review | volume = 107 | issue = 5| pages = 1476\u20131499 }}</ref>\n\nThe British historian [[Peter Burke (historian)|Peter Burke]] finds that cultural studies has numerous spinoffs, or topical themes it has strongly influenced.

The early journals were similar to those for the physical sciences, and were seen as a means for history to become more professional. Journals also helped historians to establish various historiographical approaches, the most notable example of which was ''[[Annales. \u00c9conomies, soci\u00e9t\u00e9s, civilisations]]'', a publication of the [[Annales school|''Annales'' school]] in France.  Journals now typically have one or more editors and associate editors, an editorial board, and a pool of scholars to whom articles that are submitted are sent for confidential evaluation.  The editors will send out new books to recognized scholars for reviews that usually run 500 to 1000 words. The vetting and publication process often takes months or longer. Publication in a prestigious journal (which accept 10% or fewer of the articles submitted) is an asset in the academic hiring and promotion process. Publication demonstrates that the author is conversant with the scholarly field.  Page charges and fees for publication are uncommon in history. Journals are subsidized by universities or historical societies, scholarly associations, and subscription fees from libraries and scholars. Increasingly they are available through library pools that allow many academic institutions to pool subscriptions to online versions. Most libraries have a system for obtaining specific articles through [[inter-library loan]].<ref>Margaret F.

He reported that, \"More and more of the 'new historians' are now trying to discover what was going on inside people's heads in the past, and what it was like to live in the past, questions which inevitably lead back to the use of narrative.\"<ref>Lawrence Stone, \"The Revival of Narrative: Reflections on a New Old History\", ''Past and Present'' 85 (Nov 1979) pp. 3\u201324, quote on p. 13</ref>\n\nHistorians committed to a social science approach, however, have criticized the narrowness of narrative and its preference for anecdote over analysis, and its use of clever examples rather than statistically verified empirical regularities.<ref>J. Morgan Kousser, \"The Revivalism of Narrative: A Response to Recent Criticisms of Quantitative History\", ''Social Science History'' vol 8, no. 2 (Spring 1984): 133\u201349; Eric H. Monkkonen, \"The Dangers of Synthesis\", ''American Historical Review'' 91, no. 5 (December 1986): 1146\u201357.</ref>\n\n==Topics studied==\nSome of the common topics in historiography are:\n# Reliability of the sources used, in terms of authorship, credibility of the author, and the authenticity or corruption of the text.  (See also [[source criticism]]).\n# Historiographical tradition or framework. Every historian uses one (or more) historiographical traditions, for example [[Marxist]], [[Annales school|''Annales'' school]], \"total history\", or [[political history]].\n# [[morality|Moral]] issues, guilt assignment, and praise assignment\n# [[historical revisionism|Revisionism]] versus [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] interpretations\n# Historical [[metanarratives]] and metahistory.<ref>Nikola\u012d Onufrievich Losski\u012d -History of Russian Philosophy 1951 \u2013 - Page 245 \"It must not be imagined, however, that history and metahistory are entirely separate: \"Metahistory is continually present as the background of history. That which is metahistorical breaks up both the cosmic endless sequence of events and the ...\"</ref><ref>The Visva-bharati Quarterly 1956\u2013 Page 118  \"8 Sometimes the term Metahistory is also used. But it implies going beyond, a transcendence of history and in this sense it is equated with metaphysics and theology. Sometimes historical time is distinguished from metahistorical eternity.\"</ref>\n\n==Approaches==\nHow a historian approaches historical events is one of the most important decisions within historiography. It is commonly recognised by historians that, in themselves, individual historical facts dealing with names, dates and places are not particularly meaningful. Such facts will only become useful when assembled with other historical evidence, and the process of assembling this evidence is understood as a particular historiographical approach.\n\nThe most influential historiographical approaches are:\n\n* [[Business history]]\n* [[Comparative history]]\n* [[Cultural history]]\n* [[Diplomatic history]]\n* [[Economic history]]\n* [[Environmental history]], a relatively new field\n* [[Ethnohistory]]\n* [[Gender history]] including [[Woman's history]], [[Family history]], [[Feminist history]]\n* [[History of medicine|History of Medicine]]\n* [[History of Religion]] and [[Church history|Church History]]; the history of theology is usually handled under [[Theology]]\n* [[Intellectual History]] and [[History of ideas]]\n* [[Labor history (discipline)|Labor history]]\n* [[Local History]] and [[Microhistory]]\n* [[Marxist historiography]] and [[Historical materialism]]\n* [[Military history]], including naval and air\n* [[Oral history]]\n* [[Political history]]\n* [[Public history]], especially museums and historic preservation\n* [[Quantitative history]], [[Cliometrics]] (in economic history); [[Prosopography]] using statistics to study biographies\n* [[History of religions]]\n* [[Historiography of science]] \n* [[Social history]] and [[People's history|History from below]]; along with the French version the [[Annales school|''Annales'' school]] and the German [[Bielefeld School]]\n* [[Subaltern Studies]], Regarding post-colonial India\n* [[Urban history]]\n** [[American urban history]]\n* [[Whig history]], History as the story of continuous progress\n* [[World history]]\n\n===Related fields===\nImportant related fields include:\n* [[Antiquarian]]ism\n* [[Genealogy]]\n* [[Numismatics]]\n* [[Intellectual history]]\n* [[Paleography]]\n* [[Philosophy of history]]\n* [[Pseudohistory]]\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[List of historians by area of study]]\n* [[Historical significance]]\n* [[National memory]]\n\n===Methods===\n* [[Archival research]]\n* [[Auxiliary sciences of history]]\n* [[Historical method]]\n* [[List of historians]], inclusive of most major historians\n** [[List of historians by area of study]]\n* [[List of history journals]]\n* [[Philosophy of history]]\n* [[Popular history]]\n** [[Primary source]]&nbsp;\u2013 documents, correspondence, diaries\n*** [[Secondary source]]&nbsp;\u2013 interpretations, written history\n**** [[Tertiary source]]&nbsp;\u2013 textbooks and encyclopedias\n* [[Public history]], including museums and historical preservation\n* [[Historical revisionism]]\n* [[Shared historical authority]]\n* [[v:Topic:Historiography|Historiography at Wikiversity]], where it is part of the [[v:School:History|School of History]]\n\n===Topics===\n* [[Historiography of Argentina]]\n* [[Atlantic history]]\n* [[Historiography of Canada]]\n* [[Chinese historiography]]\n* [[Classics]]\n** [[Greek historiography]] \n*** [[Historiography of Alexander the Great]]\n** [[Roman historiography]] \n*** [[Historiography of the fall of the Western Roman Empire]]\n* [[Historiography of the Cold War]]\n* [[Historiography of the French Revolution]]\n** [[Annales school|''Annales'' school]], in France\n* [[Historiography of Germany]] \n** [[Bielefeld School]], in Germany\n* [[History of India#Historiography]]\n** [[Historiography of the fall of the Mughal Empire]]\n* [[Historiography of early Islam]]\n* [[Historiography of Japan]]\n* [[Historiography of Korea]]\n** [[Korean nationalist historiography]]\n* [[History of Latin America|Latin American History]]\n* [[Middle Ages]]\n** [[Historiography of early Christianity]]\n** [[Historiography of feudalism#Historiography|Historiography of feudalism]]\n** [[Dark Ages (historiography)]]\n** [[Historiography of the Crusades]]\n* [[Historiography and nationalism]]\n* [[Historiography of Switzerland]]\n* [[Historiography in the Soviet Union]]\n* [[Historiography of the United States]]\n** [[Frontier Thesis]]\n* [[Historiography of the United Kingdom]]\n** [[Historiography of Scotland]]\n** [[Historiography of the British Empire]]\n* [[World history]]\n* [[Historiography of the causes of World War I]]\n* [[Historiography of World War II]]\n** [[Historiography of the Battle of France]], 1940\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Theory===\n* Appleby, Joyce, Lynn Hunt & Margaret Jacob, ''Telling the Truth About History''.

The historiography of a specific topic covers how historians have studied that topic using particular sources, techniques, and theoretical approaches. Scholars discuss historiography by topic\u2014such as the [[historiography of the United Kingdom]], [[historiography of World War II|that of WWII]], [[historiography of the British Empire|the British Empire]], [[historiography of early Islam|early Islam]], and [[Chinese historiography|China]]\u2014and different approaches and genres, such as [[political history]] and [[social history]]. Beginning in the nineteenth century, with the development of [[academic history]], there developed a body of historiographic literature. The extent to which historians are influenced by their own groups and loyalties\u2014such as [[Nationalist historiography|to their nation state]]\u2014remains a debated question.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ferro, Marc|title=The Use and Abuse of History: Or How the Past Is Taught to Children|date=2003}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author1=Candelaria, John Lee |author2=Alporha, Veronica |year=2018 |title=Readings in Philippine History }}</ref>\n\nIn the [[ancient world]], chronological [[annal]]s were produced in civilizations such as [[ancient Egypt]] and [[Ancient Near East|Mesopotamia]]. However, the discipline of historiography was first established in the 5th century BC with the ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' of [[Herodotus]], the founder of [[Greek historiography]]. The [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] statesman [[Cato the Elder]] produced the first [[Roman historiography|history in Latin]], the ''[[Origines]]'', in the 2nd century BC. His near contemporaries [[Sima Tan]] and [[Sima Qian]] in the [[Han Empire]] of [[Ancient China|China]] established [[Chinese historiography]] with the compiling of the ''[[Shiji]]'' (''Records of the Grand Historian''). During the [[Middle Ages]], [[medieval historiography]] included the works of [[chronicle]]s in [[Medieval literature|medieval Europe]], [[Islamic literature|Islamic histories]] by [[Muslim historians]], and the [[Korean historiography|Korean]] and [[Japanese historiography|Japanese]] historical writings based on the existing Chinese model. During the 18th century [[Age of Enlightenment]], historiography in the Western world was shaped and developed by figures such as [[Voltaire]], [[David Hume]], and [[Edward Gibbon]], who among others set the foundations for the modern discipline.\n\nThe research interests of historians change over time, and there has been a shift away from traditional diplomatic, economic, and political history toward newer approaches, especially social and [[Postcolonialism|cultural studies]]. From 1975 to 1995 the proportion of professors of history in American universities identifying with social history increased from 31 to 41 percent, while the proportion of political historians decreased from 40 to 30 percent.<ref>Diplomatic dropped from 5% to 3%, economic history from 7% to 5%, and cultural history grew from 14% to 16%.

In that sense certain [[Official history|official historians]] were given the title \"[[Historiographer Royal]]\" in [[Rikshistoriograf|Sweden]] (from 1618), [[Historiographer Royal (England)|England]] (from 1660), and [[Historiographer Royal (Scotland)|Scotland]] (from 1681). The Scottish post is still in existence.\n\nHistoriography was more recently defined as \"the study of the way history has been and is written&nbsp;\u2013 the history of historical writing\", which means that, \"When you study 'historiography' you do not study the events of the past directly, but the changing interpretations of those events in the works of individual historians.\"<ref>{{cite book |first1=Conal |last1=Furay |first2= Michael J. |last2=Salevouris |title=The Methods and Skills of History: A Practical Guide |publisher=[[Harlan Davidson (publisher)|Harlan Davidson]]<!-- This was a family-owned higher educational publishing house that was started in 1976 by someone with the surname Davidson and was sold to John Wiley & Sons in 2012, according to an Article in Publisher's Weekly. -->  |year=1988 |page=223 |isbn=0-88295-982-4}})</ref>\n\n==Antiquity==\n{{see|Ancient history}}\nUnderstanding the past appears to be a universal human need, and the \"telling of history\" has emerged independently in civilizations around the world. \nWhat constitutes history is a philosophical question (see [[philosophy of history]]).\n\nThe earliest [[Chronology|chronologies]] date back to [[Mesopotamia]] and [[ancient Egypt]], in the form of [[chronicle]]s and [[annal]]s. However, no historical writers in these early civilizations were known by name. By contrast, the term \"historiography\" is taken to refer to written history recorded in a narrative format for the purpose of informing future generations about events. In this limited sense, \"ancient history\" begins with the early historiography of [[Classical Antiquity]], in about the 5th century BCE.\n\n===Europe===\n====Greece====\n{{main|Greek historiography}}\n{{further|Ancient Greek literature}}\n[[File:Thucydides Manuscript.jpg|thumb|upright|Reproduction of part of a tenth-century copy of [[Thucydides]]'s ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]''.]]\n\nThe earliest known systematic historical thought emerged in [[ancient Greece]], a development which would be an important influence on the writing of history elsewhere around [[History of the Mediterranean region|the Mediterranean]] region. Greek historians greatly contributed to the development of historical methodology. The earliest known critical historical works were ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]'', composed by [[Herodotus|Herodotus of Halicarnassus]] (484\u2013425 BCE) who became known as the \"father of history\".<ref>John L. Myres, ''Herodotus, Father of History'' (1953).</ref> Herodotus attempted to distinguish between more and less reliable accounts, and personally conducted research by travelling extensively, giving written accounts of various Mediterranean cultures. Although Herodotus' overall emphasis lay on the actions and characters of men, he also attributed an important role to divinity in the determination of historical events.\n\n[[File:Thucydides-bust-cutout ROM.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|left|Bust of Thucydides, Hellenistic copy of a 4th-century BC work]]\n\nThe generation following Herodotus witnessed a spate of local histories of the individual [[city-state]]s (''[[polis|poleis]]''), written by the first of the [[Local history|local historians]] who employed the written archives of city and sanctuary. [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] characterized these historians as the forerunners of Thucydides,<ref>Dionysius, ''On Thucydides'', 5.</ref> and these local histories continued to be written into [[Late Antiquity]], as long as the city-states survived. Two early figures stand out: [[Hippias of Elis]], who produced the lists of winners in the Olympic Games that provided the basic chronological framework as long as the pagan classical tradition lasted, and [[Hellanicus of Lesbos]], who compiled more than two dozen histories from civic records, all of them now lost.\n\n[[Thucydides]] largely eliminated divine causality in his account of the war between Athens and Sparta, establishing a rationalistic element which set a precedent for subsequent Western historical writings. He was also the first to distinguish between cause and immediate origins of an event, while his successor [[Xenophon]] ({{c.|lk=no|431}}&nbsp;\u2013 {{annum|355|BCE}}) introduced autobiographical elements and character studies in his ''[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]''.\n\nThe proverbial [[Philippic]] attacks of the Athenian orator [[Demosthenes]] ({{annum|384\u2013322|BCE}}) on [[Philip&nbsp;II of Macedon]] marked the height of ancient political agitation. The now lost history of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander's]] campaigns by the [[diadoch]] [[Ptolemy&nbsp;I]] ({{annum|367\u2013283|BCE}}) may represent the first historical work composed by a ruler. [[Polybius]] ({{c.|lk=no|203}}&nbsp;\u2013 {{annum|120|BCE}}) wrote on the rise of Rome to world prominence, and attempted to harmonize the Greek and Roman points of view.\n\nThe [[Chaldea]]n priest [[Berossus]] ({{annum|{{floruit|3rd century}}|BCE}}) composed a Greek-language ''History of [[Babylonia]]'' for the [[Seleucid]] king [[Antiochus&nbsp;I]], combining [[Hellenistic]] methods of historiography and [[Mesopotamia]]n accounts to form a unique composite. Reports exist of other near-eastern histories, such as that of the Phoenician historian [[Sanchuniathon]]; but he is considered semi-legendary and writings attributed to him are fragmentary, known only through the later historians [[Philo of Byblos]] and [[Eusebius]], who asserted that he wrote before even the [[Trojan war]].\n\n====Rome====\n{{Main|Roman historiography}}\n{{further|Latin literature}}\n[[File:Marco Porcio Caton Major.jpg|thumb|upright|The Roman [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] of historian [[Cato the Elder]]]]\n\n[[Ancient Romans|The Romans]] adopted the Greek tradition, writing at first in Greek, but eventually chronicling their history in a freshly non-Greek language. While early [[Roman literature|Roman works]] were still written in Greek, the ''Origines'', composed by the Roman statesman [[Cato the Elder]] ({{annum|234\u2013149|BCE}}), was written in Latin, in a conscious effort to counteract Greek cultural influence. It marked the beginning of Latin historical writings. Hailed for its lucid style, [[Julius Caesar]]'s ({{annum|100\u201344|BCE}}) ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico|de Bello Gallico]]'' exemplifies autobiographical war coverage. The politician and orator [[Cicero]] ({{annum|106\u201343|BCE}}) introduced rhetorical elements in his political writings.\n\n[[Strabo]] ({{annum|63|BCE}}&nbsp;\u2013 {{annum|{{c.|lk=no|24}}|[[Common Era|CE]]}}) was an important exponent of the [[Greco-Roman]] tradition of combining geography with history, presenting a descriptive history of peoples and places known to his era. [[Livy]] ({{annum|59|BCE}}&nbsp;\u2013 {{annum|17|CE}}) records the rise of [[Roman Empire|Rome]] from [[city-state]] to [[empire]]. His speculation about what would have happened if [[Alexander the Great]] had marched against Rome represents the first known instance of [[alternate history]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/txt/ah/Livy/Livy09.html |title=Livy's History of Rome: Book 9 |publisher=Mcadams.posc.mu.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-08-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070228233052/http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/txt/ah/Livy/Livy09.html |archive-date=2007-02-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nBiography, although popular throughout antiquity, was introduced as a branch of history by the works of [[Plutarch]] ({{c.|lk=no|46}}&nbsp;\u2013 {{annum|127|CE}}) and [[Suetonius]] ({{c.|lk=no|69}}&nbsp;\u2013 after {{annum|130|CE}}) who described the deeds and characters of ancient personalities, stressing their human side. [[Tacitus]] ({{annum|{{c.|lk=no|56|117}}|CE}}) denounces Roman immorality by praising [[Germanic peoples|German]] virtues, elaborating on the [[topos]] of the [[Noble savage]].\n\n===East Asia===\n====China====\n{{Main|Chinese historiography|Twenty-Four Histories}}\n{{further|Chinese literature}}\n[[File:Shiji.jpg|upright|thumb|First page of the ''[[Shiji]]''.]]\n\nThe Han dynasty eunuch [[Sima Qian]] (around {{annum|100|BCE}}) was the first in China to lay the groundwork for professional historical writing. His work superseded the older style of the ''[[Spring and Autumn Annals]]'', compiled in the 5th century BC, the ''[[Bamboo Annals]]'' and other court and dynastic [[annals]] that recorded history in a [[chronological]] form that abstained from [[analysis]]. Sima's ''[[Shiji]]'' (''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'') pioneered the \"Annals-biography\" format, which would become the standard for prestige history writing in China. In this genre a history opens with a chronological outline of court affairs, and then continues with detailed biographies of prominent people who lived during the period in question.<ref>Thomas R. Martin, ''Herodotus and Sima Qian: The First Great Historians of Greece and China: A Brief History with Documents'' (2009).</ref> The scope of his work extended as far back as the {{annum|16th century|BCE}}, and included many treatises on specific subjects and individual biographies of prominent people. He also explored the lives and deeds of commoners, both contemporary and those of previous eras.\n\nWhereas Sima's had been a universal history from the beginning of time down to the time of writing, his successor [[Ban Gu]] wrote an annals-biography history limiting its coverage to only the [[Western Han dynasty]], the [[Book of Han]] (96 CE). This established the notion of using dynastic boundaries as start- and end-points, and most later Chinese histories would focus on a single dynasty or group of dynasties.\n\nThe Records of the Grand Historian and Book of Han were eventually joined by the [[Book of the Later Han]] (488 CE) (replacing the earlier, and now only partially extant, Han Records from the Eastern Pavilion) and the [[Records of the Three Kingdoms]] (297 CE) to form the \"Four Histories\". These became mandatory reading for the [[Imperial Examinations]] and have therefore exerted an influence on Chinese culture comparable to the [[Thirteen Classics|Confucian Classics]]. More annals-biography histories were written in subsequent dynasties, eventually bringing the number to between twenty-four and twenty-six, but none ever reached the popularity and impact of the first four.<ref>Wilkinson 2018, pp. 692-695</ref>\n\nTraditional Chinese historiography describes history in terms of [[dynastic cycle]]s. In this view, each new dynasty is founded by a morally righteous founder. Over time, the dynasty becomes morally corrupt and dissolute. Eventually, the dynasty becomes so weak as to allow its replacement by a new dynasty.<ref>{{cite book|author=J\u00f6rn R\u00fcsen|title=Time and History: The Variety of Cultures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SvGyzu-nLaUC&pg=PA54|year=2007|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=978-1-84545-349-7|pages=54\u201355}}</ref>\n\nIn 281 CE the tomb of [[King Xiang of Wei]] (d. 296 BC) was opened, inside of which was found a historical text called the [[Bamboo Annals]], after the writing material. It is similar in style to the Spring and Autumn Annals and covers the time from the [[Yellow Emperor]] to 299 BC. Opinions on the authenticity of the text has varied throughout the centuries, and in any event it was re-discovered too late to gain anything like the same status as the Spring and Autumn.<ref>Wilkinson, Endymion.

In the [[Early Christianity|first Christian centuries]], the [[Development of the New Testament canon|New Testament canon was developed]]. The [[Early centers of Christianity|growth of Christianity]] and its enhanced status in the Roman Empire after [[Constantine I and Christianity|Constantine&nbsp;I]] (see [[State church of the Roman Empire]]) led to the development of a distinct Christian historiography, influenced by both [[Christian theology]] and the nature of the [[Christian Bible]], encompassing new areas of study and views of history.  The central role of the Bible in Christianity is reflected in the preference of Christian historians for written sources, compared to the classical historians' preference for oral sources and is also reflected in the inclusion of politically unimportant people. Christian historians also focused on development of religion and society.  This can be seen in the extensive inclusion of written sources in the ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Ecclesiastical History]]'' written by [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] around 324 and in the subjects it covers.<ref name=\"sxixkf\">[http://www.cuw.edu/Academics/programs/history/historiography.html ''Historiography''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018032745/http://www.cuw.edu/Academics/programs/history/historiography.html |date=2007-10-18 }}, Concordia University Wisconsin, retrieved on 2 November 2007</ref>  Christian theology considered time as linear, progressing according to divine plan.  As God's plan encompassed everyone, Christian histories in this period had a universal approach. For example, Christian writers often included summaries of important historical events prior to the period covered by the work.<ref>Warren, John (1998).

They wrote about the history of Jesus Christ, that of the Church and that of their patrons, the dynastic history of the local rulers.  In the [[early medieval|Early Middle Ages]] historical writing often took the form of [[annals]] or [[chronicle]]s recording events year by year, but this style tended to hamper the analysis of events and causes.<ref>Warren, John (1998). ''The past and its presenters: an introduction to issues in historiography'', Hodder & Stoughton, {{ISBN|0-340-67934-4}}, pp. 78\u201379.</ref> An example of this type of writing is the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', which was the work of several different writers: it was started during the reign of [[Alfred the Great]] in the late 9th&nbsp;century, but one copy was still being updated in 1154.  Some writers in the period did construct a more [[narrative]] form of history. These included [[Gregory of Tours]] and more successfully [[Bede]], who wrote both [[secular]] and [[ecclesiastical]] history and who is known for writing the ''[[Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]''.<ref name = \"sxixkf\"/>\n\nDuring the [[Renaissance]], history was written about states or nations. The study of history changed during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and [[Romanticism]]. [[Voltaire]] described the history of certain ages that he considered important, rather than describing events in chronological order. History became an independent discipline. It was not called ''philosophia historiae'' anymore, but merely history (''historia'').\n\n[[File:Ibn khaldun writting-ms.jpg|thumb|upright|Autograph writing of [[Ibn Khaldun]], pioneer of historiography, [[cultural history]], and the [[philosophy of history]].]]\n\n===Islamic world===\n{{See also|Historiography of early Islam|Muqaddimah|Muslim historians}}\n\n[[Muslim]] historical writings first began to develop in the 7th century, with the reconstruction of the Prophet [[Muhammad]]'s life in the centuries following his death. With numerous conflicting narratives regarding Muhammad and his [[Sahaba|companions]] from various sources, it was necessary to verify which sources were more reliable. In order to evaluate these sources, various methodologies were developed, such as the \"[[Ilm ar-Rijal|science of biography]]\", \"[[science of hadith]]\" and \"[[Isnad]]\" (chain of transmission). These methodologies were later applied to other historical figures in the [[Islamic Golden Age|Islamic civilization]]. Famous historians in this tradition include [[Urwah ibn Zubayr|Urwah]] (d.&nbsp;712), [[Wahb ibn Munabbih]] (d.&nbsp;728), [[Ibn Ishaq]] (d.&nbsp;761), [[al-Waqidi]] (745\u2013822), [[Ibn Hisham]] (d.&nbsp;834), [[Muhammad al-Bukhari]] (810\u2013870) and [[Ibn Hajar Asqalani|Ibn Hajar]] (1372\u20131449).<ref>Chase F.

Among the many Italians who contributed to this were [[Leonardo Bruni]] (c. 1370\u20131444), [[Francesco Guicciardini]] (1483\u20131540), and [[Caesar Baronius|Cesare Baronio]] (1538\u20131607).\n\n===Voltaire===\nFrench ''[[Philosophes|philosophe]]'' [[Voltaire]] (1694\u20131778) had an enormous influence on the development of historiography during the Age of Enlightenment through his demonstration of fresh new ways to look at the past. Guillaume de Syon argues:\n:Voltaire recast historiography in both factual and analytical terms. Not only did he reject traditional biographies and accounts that claim the work of supernatural forces, but he went so far as to suggest that earlier historiography was rife with falsified evidence and required new investigations at the source. Such an outlook was not unique in that the scientific spirit that 18th-century intellectuals perceived themselves as invested with. A rationalistic approach was key to rewriting history.<ref>Guillaume de Syon, \"Voltaire,\" in {{cite book|author=Kelly Boyd. ed.|title=Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing, vol 2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0121vD9STIMC&pg=PA1270|date=1999|publisher=Taylor & Francis|pages=1270\u201372|isbn=9781884964336}}</ref>\n\nVoltaire's best-known histories are ''[[The Age of Louis XIV]]'' (1751), and his ''[[Essai sur les m\u0153urs et l'esprit des nations|Essay on the Customs and the Spirit of the Nations]]'' (1756). He broke from the tradition of narrating diplomatic and military events, and emphasized customs, social history and achievements in the arts and sciences. He was the first scholar to make a serious attempt to write the history of the world, eliminating theological frameworks, and emphasizing economics, culture and political history. Although he repeatedly warned against political bias on the part of the historian, he did not miss many opportunities to expose the intolerance and frauds of the church over the ages. Voltaire advised scholars that anything contradicting the normal course of nature was not to be believed. Although he found evil in the historical record, he fervently believed reason and educating the illiterate masses would lead to progress.\n\nVoltaire explains his view of historiography in his article on \"History\" in Diderot's ''[[Encyclop\u00e9die]]'': ''\"One demands of modern historians more details, better ascertained facts, precise dates, more attention to customs, laws, mores, commerce, finance, agriculture, population.\"'' Already in 1739 he had written: ''\"My chief object is not political or military history, it is the history of the arts, of commerce, of civilization&nbsp;\u2013 in a word,&nbsp;\u2013 of the human mind.\"''<ref>{{cite book|author=E.

In 1754 he published ''[[The History of England (David Hume)|The History of England]]'', a 6-volume work which extended \"From the Invasion of Julius Caesar to the Revolution in 1688\". Hume adopted a similar scope to Voltaire in his history; as well as the history of Kings, Parliaments, and armies, he examined the history of culture, including literature and science, as well. His short biographies of leading scientists explored the process of scientific change and he developed new ways of seeing scientists in the context of their times by looking at how they interacted with society and each other&nbsp;\u2013 he paid special attention to [[Francis Bacon]], [[Robert Boyle]], [[Isaac Newton]] and [[William Harvey]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wertz | first1 = S.

The first volume was accidentally burned by [[John Stuart Mill]]'s maid. Carlyle rewrote it from scratch.<ref>John D. Rosenberg, ''Carlyle and the Burden of History''  (1985).</ref> Carlyle's style of historical writing stressed the immediacy of action, often using the present tense.  He emphasised the role of forces of the spirit in history and thought that chaotic events demanded what he called 'heroes' to take control over the competing forces erupting within society. He considered the dynamic forces of history as being the hopes and aspirations of people that took the form of ideas, and were often ossified into ideologies. Carlyle's ''The French Revolution'' was written in a highly unorthodox style, far removed from the neutral and detached tone of the tradition of Gibbon. Carlyle presented the history as dramatic events unfolding in the present as though he and the reader were participants on the streets of Paris at the famous events.  Carlyle's invented style was epic poetry combined with philosophical treatise. It is rarely read or cited in the last century.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cobban | first1 = Alfred | year = 1963 | title = Carlyle's French Revolution | url = | journal = History | volume = 48 | issue = 164| pages = 306\u201316 }}</ref><ref>Mark Cumming, ''A Disimprisoned Epic: Form and Vision in Carlyle's French Revolution'' (1988).</ref>\n\n===French historians: Michelet and Taine===\n[[File:Jules Michelet portrait older.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Jules Michelet (1798\u20131874), later in his career.]]\n[[File:Hippolyte taine.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Hippolyte Taine (1828\u20131893)]]\n\nIn his main work ''Histoire de France'' (1855), French historian [[Jules Michelet]] (1798\u20131874) coined the term [[Renaissance]] (meaning \"rebirth\" in [[French language|French]]), as a period in Europe's cultural history that represented a break from the Middle Ages, creating a modern understanding of humanity and its place in the world.<ref>{{cite book|authorlink1=Jerry Brotton|last=Brotton|first=Jerry|title=The Renaissance Bazaar|year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=21\u201322}}</ref> The 19-volume work covered French history from [[Charlemagne]] to the outbreak of the [[French Revolution]].

He had a decisive impact on scholars. Gayana Jurkevich argues that led by Michelet:\n:19th-century French historians no longer saw history as the chronicling of royal dynasties, armies, treaties, and great men of state, but as the history of ordinary French people and the landscape of France.<ref>{{cite book|author=Gayana Jurkevich|title=In Pursuit of the Natural Sign|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-mV6wNgmwT4C&pg=PA42|year=1999|page=42|isbn=9780838754139}}</ref>\n\n[[Hippolyte Taine]] (1828\u20131893), although unable to secure an academic position, was the chief theoretical influence of French [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalism]], a major proponent of [[sociological positivism]], and one of the first practitioners of [[Historicism|historicist]] criticism.

According to [[John Lukacs]], he was the first master of cultural history, which seeks to describe the spirit and the forms of expression of a particular age, a particular people, or a particular place.  His innovative approach to historical research stressed the importance of art and its inestimable value as a primary source for the study of history. He was one of the first historians to rise above the narrow nineteenth-century notion that \"history is past politics and politics current history.<ref>John Lukacs, Remembered Past: John Lukacs on History, Historians, and Historical Knowledge, ed. Mark G Malvasi and Jeffrey O. Nelson, Wilmington, DE: ISI Books, 2004, p. 215.</ref>\n\nBy the mid-19th century, scholars were beginning to analyse the history of institutional change, particularly the development of constitutional government. [[William Stubbs]]'s  ''Constitutional History of England'' (3 vols., 1874\u201378) was an important influence on this developing field. The work traced the development of the English constitution from the Teutonic invasions of Britain until 1485, and marked a distinct step in the advance of English historical learning.<ref>[[s:A Short Biographical Dictionary of English Literature/Stubbs, William]]</ref> He argued that the theory of the unity and continuity of history should not remove distinctions between ancient and modern history. He believed that, though work on ancient history is a useful preparation for the study of modern history, either may advantageously be studied apart. He was a good [[palaeography|palaeographer]], and excelled in textual criticism, in examination of authorship, and other such matters, while his vast erudition and retentive memory made him second to none in interpretation and exposition.<ref>Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (11th ed.)</ref>\n\n===Von Ranke and professionalization in Germany===\n{{main|Historiography of Germany}}\n[[File:Leopold Von Ranke 1877.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Leopold von Ranke|Ranke]] established history as a professional academic discipline in Germany.]]\n\nThe modern academic study of history and methods of historiography were pioneered in 19th-century German universities, especially the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]]. [[Leopold von Ranke]] (1795\u20131886) at Berlin was a pivotal influence in this regard, and was the founder of modern source-based history.<ref>Frederick C.

[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2504333 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nSpecifically, he implemented the seminar teaching method in his classroom, and focused on archival research and analysis of historical documents. Beginning with his first book in 1824, the ''History of the Latin and Teutonic Peoples from 1494 to 1514'', Ranke used an unusually wide variety of sources for a historian of the age, including \"memoirs, diaries, personal and formal missives, government documents, diplomatic dispatches and first-hand accounts of eye-witnesses\". Over a career that spanned much of the century, Ranke set the standards for much of later historical writing, introducing such ideas as reliance on [[primary source]]s, an emphasis on [[narrative history]] and especially international politics (''aussenpolitik'').<ref>E. Sreedharan, ''A textbook of historiography, 500&nbsp;BC to AD&nbsp;2000'' (2004) p. 185</ref>  Sources had to be solid, not speculations and rationalizations. His credo was to write history the way it was. He insisted on primary sources with proven authenticity.\n\nRanke also rejected the 'teleological approach' to history, which traditionally viewed each period as inferior to the period which follows. In Ranke's view, the historian had to understand a period on its own terms, and seek to find only the general ideas which animated every period of history. In 1831 and at the behest of the [[Prussia]]n government, Ranke founded and edited the first historical journal in the world, called ''Historisch-Politische Zeitschrift''.\n\nAnother important German thinker was [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], whose theory of historical progress ran counter to Ranke's approach. In Hegel's own words, his philosophical theory of \"World history... represents the development of the spirit's consciousness of its own [[Freedom of will|freedom]] and of the consequent realization of this freedom.\".<ref>''Lectures'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=pjfaimuprzoC&pg=PA138&hl=en&dq=%22represents+the+development+of+the+spirit's+consciousness+of+its+own+freedom+and+of+the+consequent+realisation+of+this+freedom.%22 p. 138].</ref> This realization is seen by studying the various cultures that have developed over the millennia, and trying to understand the way that freedom has worked itself out through them:\n\n<blockquote>World history is the record of the spirit's efforts to attain knowledge of what it is in itself.

In his conception, the economic conditions and dominant modes of production determined the structure of society at that point. In his view five successive stages in the development of material conditions would occur in [[Western Europe]]. The first stage was [[primitive communism]] where property was shared and there was no concept of \"leadership\". This progressed to a [[Slavery|slave society]] where the idea of [[Social class|class]] emerged and the [[State (polity)|State]] developed. [[Feudalism]] was characterized by an [[aristocracy]] working in partnership with a [[theocracy]] and the emergence of the [[Nation-state]]. [[Capitalism]] appeared after the bourgeois revolution when the capitalists (or their merchant predecessors) overthrew the feudal system and established a [[market economy]], with\n[[private property]] and [[Parliamentary democracy]]. Marx then predicted the eventual proletarian revolution that would result in the attainment of [[socialism]], followed by [[Communism]], where property would be communally owned.\n\nPrevious historians had focused on cyclical events of the rise and decline of rulers and nations. Process of [[nationalization of history]], as part of [[Romantic nationalism|national revivals]] in the 19th century, resulted with separation of \"one's own\" history from common [[universal history]] by such way of perceiving, understanding and treating the past that constructed history as history of a nation.<ref name = \"laboratory\">{{Cite book\n| url         = https://books.google.com/?id=f52rawP96lYC&pg=PA39&lpg=PA39&dq=%22nationalisation+of+history%22#v=onepage&q=%22nationalisation%20of%20history%22&f=false\n| title       = A Laboratory of Transnational History Ukraine and recent Ukrainian historiography\n| accessdate  = October 18, 2010\n| author      = Georgiy Kasianov, Philipp Terr\n| pages       = 7\n| quote       = This essay deals with, what I call, \"nationalized history\", meaning a way of perceiving, understanding and treating the past that requires separation of \"one's own\" history from \"common\" history and its construction as history of a nation.\n| isbn       = 978-1-84545-621-4\n| date         = 2010-04-07}}</ref> A new discipline, [[sociology]], emerged in the late 19th century and analyzed and compared these perspectives on a larger scale.\n\n===Macaulay and Whig history===\n[[File:Thomas Babington Macaulay, Baron Macaulay.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|Macaulay]] was the most influential exponent of the [[Whig history]]]]\n\nThe term [[Whig history]], coined by [[Herbert Butterfield]] in his short book ''The Whig Interpretation of History'' in 1931, means the approach to historiography which presents the past as an inevitable progression towards ever greater liberty and enlightenment, culminating in modern forms of [[liberal democracy]] and [[constitutional monarchy]]. In general, Whig historians emphasized the rise of [[constitutional government]], [[personal freedom]]s and [[scientific progress]].

The school emphasized the use of quantification and the paying of special attention to geography.<ref>See Lucien Febvre, ''La Terre et l'\u00e9volution humaine'' (1922), translated as ''A Geographical Introduction to History'' (London, 1932).</ref><ref>See [http://www.editions.ehess.fr/revues/annales-histoire-sciences-sociales/numeros-parus/ for recent issues]</ref>\n\nThe ''Annales d'histoire \u00e9conomique et sociale'' journal was founded in 1929 in [[Strasbourg]] by [[Marc Bloch]] and [[Lucien Febvre]]. These authors, the former a medieval historian and the latter an early modernist, quickly became associated with the distinctive ''Annales'' approach, which combined geography, history, and the sociological approaches of the [[Ann\u00e9e Sociologique]] (many members of which were their colleagues at Strasbourg) to produce an approach which rejected the predominant emphasis on politics, diplomacy and war of many 19th and early 20th-century historians as spearheaded by historians whom Febvre called Les Sorbonnistes. Instead, they pioneered an approach to a study of long-term historical structures (''la [[longue dur\u00e9e]]'') over events and political transformations.<ref>Colin Jones, \"Olwen Hufton's 'Poor', Richard Cobb's 'People', and the Notions of the longue dur\u00e9e in French Revolutionary Historiography\", ''Past & Present'', 2006 Supplement (Volume 1), pp. 178\u2013203 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/past_and_present/v2006/2006.1Sjones.html in Project Muse]</ref>  Geography, material culture, and what later Annalistes called ''mentalit\u00e9s'', or the psychology of the epoch, are also characteristic areas of study. The goal of the ''Annales'' was to undo the work of the ''Sorbonnistes'', to turn French historians away from the narrowly political and diplomatic toward the new vistas in social and economic history.<ref>J.H.

Braudel developed the idea, often associated with Annalistes, of different modes of historical time: ''l'histoire quasi immobile'' (motionless history) of historical geography, the history of social, political and economic structures (''la [[longue dur\u00e9e]]''), and the history of men and events, in the context of their structures. His 'longue dur\u00e9e' approach stressed slow, and often imperceptible effects of space, climate and technology on the actions of human beings in the past.  The ''Annales'' historians, after living through two world wars and major political upheavals in France, were deeply uncomfortable with the notion that multiple ruptures and discontinuities created history. They preferred to stress slow change and the longue dur\u00e9e. They paid special attention to geography, climate, and demography as long-term factors. They considered the continuities of the deepest structures were central to history, beside which upheavals in institutions or the superstructure of social life were of little significance, for history lies beyond the reach of conscious actors, especially the will of revolutionaries.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Olivia |last=Harris |title=Braudel: Historical Time and the Horror of Discontinuity |journal=[[History Workshop Journal]] |year=2004 |volume=57 |pages=161\u2013174 |issn=1363-3554 |url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/849/ |doi=10.1093/hwj/57.1.161 |citeseerx=10.1.1.693.9898 }} Only Ari\u00e8s was a true conservative\u2014indeed a royalist.</ref>\n\nNoting the political upheavals in Europe and especially in France in 1968, [[Eric Hobsbawm]] argued that \"in France the virtual hegemony of Braudelian history and the ''Annales'' came to an end after 1968, and the international influence of the journal dropped steeply.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Eric J.

Scholars moved in multiple directions, covering in disconnected fashion the social, economic, and cultural history of different eras and different parts of the globe. By the time of crisis the school was building a vast publishing and research network reaching across France, Europe, and the rest of the world. Influence indeed spread out from Paris, but few new ideas came in. Much emphasis was given to quantitative data, seen as the key to unlocking all of social history.<ref>One of numerous spin-off journals was ''Histoire & mesure'' (1986\u2014), devoted to quantitative history.</ref>  However, the ''Annales'' ignored the developments in quantitative studies underway in the U.S. and Britain, which reshaped economic, political and demographic research.<ref>Georg G.

[[Friedrich Engels]] wrote ''[[The Peasant War in Germany]]'', which analysed social warfare in early Protestant Germany in terms of emerging capitalist classes. Although it lacked a rigorous engagement with archival sources, it indicated an early interest in [[People's history|history from below]] and class analysis, and it attempts a dialectical analysis. Another treatise of Engels, ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]'', was salient in creating the [[socialist]] impetus in British politics from then on, e.g. the [[Fabian Society]].\n\n[[R. H. Tawney]] was an early historian working in this tradition. ''The Agrarian Problem in the Sixteenth Century'' (1912)<ref>[[William Rose Ben\u00e9t]] (1988) p.&nbsp;961</ref> and ''Religion and the Rise of Capitalism'' (1926), reflected his ethical concerns and preoccupations in economic history. He was profoundly interested in the issue of the enclosure of land in the English countryside in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and in [[Max Weber]]'s thesis on the connection between the appearance of [[Protestantism]] and the rise of capitalism. His belief in the rise of the gentry in the century before the outbreak of the Civil War in England provoked the 'Storm over the Gentry' in which his methods were subjected to severe criticisms by [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]] and John Cooper.\n\n[[Historiography in the Soviet Union]] was greatly influenced by Marxist historiography, as [[historical materialism]] was extended into the Soviet version of [[dialectical materialism]].\n\nA circle of historians inside the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] (CPGB) formed in 1946 and became a highly influential cluster of [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Marxist historiography|Marxist historians]], who contributed to [[history from below]] and class structure in early capitalist society. While some members of the group (most notably [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]] and [[E. P. Thompson]]) left the CPGB after the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution]], the common points of British Marxist historiography continued in their works. They placed a great emphasis on the subjective determination of history.\n\nChristopher Hill's studies on 17th-century English history were widely acknowledged and recognised as representative of this school.<ref name=\"Oxford DNB\">{{cite ODNB|title=Hill, (John Edward) Christopher (1912\u20132003)|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/89437|accessdate=29 June 2012|date=January 2007|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/89437}}</ref> His books include ''Puritanism and Revolution'' (1958), ''Intellectual Origins of the English Revolution'' (1965 and revised in 1996), ''The Century of Revolution'' (1961), ''AntiChrist in 17th-century England'' (1971), ''The World Turned Upside Down'' (1972) and many others.\n\n[[E. P. Thompson]] pioneered the study of history from below in his work, ''[[The Making of the English Working Class]]'', published in 1963. It focused on the forgotten history of the first working-class political left in the world in the late-18th and early-19th centuries. In his preface to this book, Thompson set out his approach to writing history from below:\n\n{{quote|text=I am seeking to rescue the poor stockinger, the [[Luddite]] cropper, the \"obsolete\" hand-loom weaver, the \"Utopian\" artisan, and even the deluded follower of [[Joanna Southcott]], from the enormous condescension of posterity. Their crafts and traditions may have been dying. Their hostility to the new industrialism may have been backward-looking. Their communitarian ideals may have been fantasies. Their insurrectionary conspiracies may have been foolhardy. But they lived through these times of acute social disturbance, and we did not. Their aspirations were valid in terms of their own experience; and, if they were casualties of history, they remain, condemned in their own lives, as casualties.}}\n\nThompson's work was also significant because of the way he defined \"class\". He argued that class was not a structure, but a relationship that changed over time. He opened the gates for a generation of labor historians, such as [[David Montgomery (historian)|David Montgomery]] and [[Herbert Gutman]], who made similar studies of the American working classes.\n\nOther important Marxist historians included [[Eric Hobsbawm]], [[C. L. R. James]], [[Raphael Samuel]], [[A. L. Morton]] and [[Brian Pearce]].\n\nAlthough Marxist historiography made important contributions to the history of the [[working class]], oppressed nationalities, and the [[methodology]] of [[People's history|history from below]], its chief problematic aspect was its argument on the nature of history as ''determined'' or ''dialectical''; this can also be stated as the relative importance of subjective and objective factors in creating outcomes. It increasingly fell out of favour in the 1960s and '70s. [[Geoffrey Elton]] was important in undermining the case for a [[Marxist historiography]], which he argued was presenting seriously flawed interpretations of the past. In particular, Elton was opposed to the idea that the [[English Civil War]] was caused by socioeconomic changes in the 16th and 17th centuries, arguing instead that it was due largely to the incompetence of the [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] kings.<ref>See his essays 'The Stuart Century', 'A High Road to Civil War?' and 'The Unexplained Revolution' in G. R. Elton, ''Studies in Tudor and Stuart Politics and Government: Volume II'' (Cambridge University Press, 1974).</ref>\n\nIn dealing with the era of the [[Second World War]], Addison notes that in Britain by the 1990s, labour history was, \"in sharp decline\", because:\n{{quote|there was no longer much interest in history of the white, male working-class.  Instead the 'cultural turn' encouraged historians to explore wartime constructions of gender, race, citizenship and national identity.<ref>Paul Addison and Harriet Jones, eds. ''A Companion to Contemporary Britain: 1939\u20132000'' (2005) p 4</ref>}}\n\n===Biography===\n{{Further|Biography}}\nBiography has been a major form of historiography since the days when [[Plutarch]] wrote the parallel lives of great Roman and Greek leaders. It is a field especially attractive to nonacademic historians, and often to the spouses or children of famous people, who have access to the trove of letters and documents. Academic historians tend to downplay biography because it pays too little attention to broad social, cultural, political and economic forces, and perhaps too much attention to popular psychology. The \"[[Great man theory|Great Man]]\" tradition in Britain originated in the multi-volume ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' (which originated in 1882 and issued updates into the 1970s); it continues to this day in the new ''[[Dictionary of National Biography|Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'.' In the United States, the ''[[Dictionary of American Biography]]'' was planned in the late 1920s and appeared with numerous supplements into the 1980s.  It has now been displaced by the ''[[American National Biography]]'' as well as numerous smaller historical encyclopedias that give thorough coverage to Great Persons. Bookstores do a thriving business in biographies, which sell far more copies than the esoteric monographs based on post-structuralism, cultural, racial or gender history. [[Michael Holroyd]] says the last forty years \"may be seen as a golden age of biography\", but nevertheless calls it the \"shallow end of history\". Nicolas Barker argues that \"more and more biographies command an ever larger readership\", as he speculates that biography has come \"to express the spirit of our age\".<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Riall | first1 = Lucy | year = 2010 | title = The Shallow End of History?

Meister argues that:\n{{quote|Biography Studies is emerging as an independent discipline, especially in the Netherlands.

G. Collingwood]]'s idealism, and rejected the empirical view of the historian's work being an accretion of \"facts\" that they have at their disposal as nonsense.  He maintained that there is such a vast quantity of information that the historian always chooses the \"facts\" they decide to make use of. In Carr's famous example, he claimed that millions had crossed the Rubicon, but only Julius Caesar's crossing in 49 BC is declared noteworthy by historians.<ref name=\"Huges-Warrington, Marnie p. 26\">Huges-Warrington, p. 26</ref><ref>Carr, ''What Is History?'', p. 10;</ref> For this reason, Carr argued that [[Leopold von Ranke]]'s famous dictum ''wie es eigentlich gewesen'' (show what actually happened) was wrong because it presumed that the \"facts\" influenced what the historian wrote, rather than the historian choosing what \"facts of the past\" they intended to turn into \"historical facts\".<ref>Carr, ''What Is History?'', pp. 8\u201313</ref> At the same time, Carr argued that the study of the facts may lead the historian to change his or her views.  In this way, Carr argued that history was \"an unending dialogue between the past and present\".<ref name=\"Huges-Warrington, Marnie p. 26\"/><ref>Carr, ''What Is History?'', p. 30</ref>\n\nCarr is held by some critics to have had a deterministic outlook in history.<ref name=\"Huges-Warrington, Marnie p. 27\">Huges-Warrington, p. 27. One of his first and most influential critics was the British philosopher, Michael Oakeshott, 'What is History?' (1961), in idem, ''What is History and Other Essays'' (Exeter, 2004), 325.</ref> Others have modified or rejected this use of the label \"determinist\".<ref>See M. Hewitson, ''History and Causality'' (Basingstoke, 2014), pp. 86\u201393.</ref> He took a hostile view of those historians who stress the workings of chance and contingency in the workings of history. In Carr's view, no individual is truly free of the social environment in which they live, but contended that within those limitations, there was room, albeit very narrow room for people to make decisions that affect history.  Carr emphatically contended that history was a [[Social sciences|social science]], not an [[The arts|art]],<ref name=HW28>Huges-Warrington, p. 28</ref> because historians like scientists seek generalizations that helped to broaden the understanding of one's subject.<ref name=HW28/><ref>Carr, ''What Is History?'', p. 62</ref>\n\nOne of Carr's most forthright critics was [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]], who argued that Carr's dismissal of the \"might-have-beens of history\" reflected a fundamental lack of interest in examining historical causation.<ref>Trevor-Roper, pp. 72\u201373</ref> Trevor-Roper asserted that examining possible alternative outcomes of history was far from being a \"parlour-game\" was rather an essential part of the historians' work,<ref name=\"Trevor-Roper p. 73\">Trevor-Roper, p. 73</ref> as only by considering all possible outcomes of a given situation could a historian properly understand the period.\n\nThe controversy inspired Sir [[Geoffrey Elton]] to write his 1967 book ''The Practice of History''. Elton criticized Carr for his \"whimsical\" distinction between the \"historical facts\" and the \"facts of the past\", arguing that it reflected \"...an extraordinarily arrogant attitude both to the past and to the place of the historian studying it\".<ref>Elton, Geoffrey ''The Practice of History'', London: Methuen, 1967 pp. 56\u201357</ref> Elton, instead, strongly defended the traditional methods of history and was also appalled by the inroads made by [[postmodernism]].<ref>\u00d3 Tuathaigh, M. A.

As a traditionalist, he placed great emphasis on the role of individuals in history instead of abstract, impersonal forces. Elton saw political history as the highest kind of history. Elton had no use for those who seek history to make myths, to create laws to explain the past, or to produce theories such as [[Marxism]].\n\n===U.S. approaches===\n{{main|Historiography of the United States}}\nClassical and European history was part of the 19th-century grammar curriculum.

It stressed the central importance of class conflict in American history. Important leaders included [[Vernon L. Parrington]], [[Carl L. Becker]], [[Arthur M. Schlesinger, Sr.]], John Hicks, and [[C. Vann Woodward]].<ref>John Higham, ''History: Professional Scholarship in America'' (1965) pp 171\u2013211</ref> The movement established a strong base at the History Department at the University of Wisconsin with Curtis Nettels, William Hesseltine, [[Merle Curti]], [[Howard K.

Instead, they proclaimed it was a:\n:social cataclysm in which the capitalists, laborers, and farmers of the North and West drove from power in the national government the planting aristocracy of the South. Viewed under the light of universal history, the fighting was a fleeting incident; the social revolution was the essential portentous outcome.... The Second American Revolution, while destroying the economic foundation of the slave-owning aristocracy, assured the triumph of business enterprise.\"<ref>Charles A.  Beard and Mary R.  Beard, ''The Rise of American Civilization'' (1927) vol 2 pp 54, 166</ref>\n\n[[Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.]] wrote the ''Age of Jackson'' (1945), one of the last major books from this viewpoint. Schlesinger made Jackson a hero for his successful attacks on the [[Second Bank of the United States]]. His own views were clear enough: \"Moved typically by personal and class, rarely by public, considerations, the business community has invariably brought national affairs to a state of crisis and exasperated the rest of society into dissatisfaction bordering on revolt.\"<ref>Schlesinger, ''Age of Jackson'' (1945) p 521.</ref>\n\n====Consensus history====\n{{main|Consensus history}}\nConsensus history emphasizes the basic unity of American values and downplays conflict as superficial.  It was especially attractive in the 1950s and 1960s.

The goal was to incorporate in historical studies perspectives from all the social sciences, especially political science, sociology and economics. The pioneers shared a commitment to quantification. However, by the 1980s the first blush of quantification had worn off, as traditional historians counterattacked. [[Harvey J. Graff]] says:\n{{quote|The case against the new mixed and confused a lengthy list of ingredients, including the following: history\u2019s supposed loss of identity and humanity in the stain of social science, the fear of subordinating quality to quantity, conceptual and technical fallacies, violation of the literary character and biographical base of \", good\" history (rhetorical and aesthetic concern), loss of audiences, derogation of history rooted in \", great men\" and \", great events\", trivialization in general, a hodge-podge of ideological objections from all directions, and a fear that new historians were reaping research funds that might otherwise come to their detractors.

Another standard division within the historiography is the temporal factor, with works falling into either the early modern period (or \u201ccolonial era\u201d) or the post-independence (or \u201cnational\u201d) period, from the early nineteenth onward. Relatively few works span the two eras and few works except textbooks unite Spanish America and Brazil. There is a tendency to focus on histories of particular countries or regions (the Andes, the Southern Cone, the Caribbean) with relatively little comparative work.\n\nHistorians of Latin America have contributed to various types of historical writing, but one major, innovative development in Spanish American history is the emergence of [[ethnohistory]], the history of indigenous peoples, especially in Mexico based on alphabetic sources in Spanish or in [[New Philology|indigenous languages]].<ref>Howard F.

It focused on the examination of history from a global perspective and looked for common patterns that emerged across all cultures. The basic thematic approach of this field was to analyse two major focal points: [[syncretism|integration]]&nbsp;\u2013 (how processes of world history have drawn people of the world together), and difference&nbsp;\u2013 (how patterns of world history reveal the diversity of the human experience).\n\n[[Arnold J. Toynbee]]'s ten-volume ''[[A Study of History]]'', took an approach that was widely discussed in the 1930s and 1940s. By the 1960s his work was virtually ignored by scholars and the general public.  He compared 26 independent civilizations and argued that they displayed striking parallels in their origin, growth, and decay.  He proposed a universal model to each of these civilizations, detailing the stages through which they all pass: genesis, growth, time of troubles, universal state, and disintegration. The later volumes gave too much emphasis on spirituality to satisfy critics.<ref>William H. McNeill, ''Arnold J. Toynbee a Life'' (1989)</ref>\n\nChicago historian [[William Hardy McNeill|William H. McNeill]] wrote ''[[The Rise of the West]]'' (1965) to show how the separate civilizations of Eurasia interacted from the very beginning of their history, borrowing critical skills from one another, and thus precipitating still further change as adjustment between traditional old and borrowed new knowledge and practice became necessary. He then discusses the dramatic effect of [[Western culture|Western civilization]] on others in the past 500 years of history. McNeill took a broad approach organized around the interactions of peoples across the globe. Such interactions have become both more numerous and more continual and substantial in recent times. Before about 1500, the network of communication between cultures was that of Eurasia. The term for these areas of interaction differ from one world historian to another and include ''world-system'' and ''ecumene.'' His emphasis on cultural fusions influenced historical theory significantly.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = McNeill | first1 = William H. | year = 1995 | title = The Changing Shape of World History | url = | journal = History and Theory | volume = 34 | issue = 2| pages = 8\u201326 }}</ref>\n\n===The cultural turn===\nThe \"cultural turn\" of the 1980s and 1990s affected scholars in most areas of history.<ref>It missed some areas.

The early journals were similar to those for the physical sciences, and were seen as a means for history to become more professional. Journals also helped historians to establish various historiographical approaches, the most notable example of which was ''[[Annales. \u00c9conomies, soci\u00e9t\u00e9s, civilisations]]'', a publication of the [[Annales school|''Annales'' school]] in France.  Journals now typically have one or more editors and associate editors, an editorial board, and a pool of scholars to whom articles that are submitted are sent for confidential evaluation.  The editors will send out new books to recognized scholars for reviews that usually run 500 to 1000 words. The vetting and publication process often takes months or longer. Publication in a prestigious journal (which accept 10% or fewer of the articles submitted) is an asset in the academic hiring and promotion process. Publication demonstrates that the author is conversant with the scholarly field.  Page charges and fees for publication are uncommon in history. Journals are subsidized by universities or historical societies, scholarly associations, and subscription fees from libraries and scholars.

In 1979, at a time when the new [[Social History]] was demanding a social-science model of analysis, Stone detected a move back toward the narrative. Stone defined narrative as follows: it is organized [[chronological]]ly; it is focused on a single coherent story; it is descriptive rather than analytical; it is concerned with people not abstract circumstances; and it deals with the particular and specific rather than the collective and statistical. He reported that, \"More and more of the 'new historians' are now trying to discover what was going on inside people's heads in the past, and what it was like to live in the past, questions which inevitably lead back to the use of narrative.\"<ref>Lawrence Stone, \"The Revival of Narrative: Reflections on a New Old History\", ''Past and Present'' 85 (Nov 1979) pp. 3\u201324, quote on p. 13</ref>\n\nHistorians committed to a social science approach, however, have criticized the narrowness of narrative and its preference for anecdote over analysis, and its use of clever examples rather than statistically verified empirical regularities.<ref>J. Morgan Kousser, \"The Revivalism of Narrative: A Response to Recent Criticisms of Quantitative History\", ''Social Science History'' vol 8, no. 2 (Spring 1984): 133\u201349; Eric H. Monkkonen, \"The Dangers of Synthesis\", ''American Historical Review'' 91, no. 5 (December 1986): 1146\u201357.</ref>\n\n==Topics studied==\nSome of the common topics in historiography are:\n# Reliability of the sources used, in terms of authorship, credibility of the author, and the authenticity or corruption of the text.  (See also [[source criticism]]).\n# Historiographical tradition or framework. Every historian uses one (or more) historiographical traditions, for example [[Marxist]], [[Annales school|''Annales'' school]], \"total history\", or [[political history]].\n# [[morality|Moral]] issues, guilt assignment, and praise assignment\n# [[historical revisionism|Revisionism]] versus [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] interpretations\n# Historical [[metanarratives]] and metahistory.<ref>Nikola\u012d Onufrievich Losski\u012d -History of Russian Philosophy 1951 \u2013 - Page 245 \"It must not be imagined, however, that history and metahistory are entirely separate: \"Metahistory is continually present as the background of history. That which is metahistorical breaks up both the cosmic endless sequence of events and the ...\"</ref><ref>The Visva-bharati Quarterly 1956\u2013 Page 118  \"8 Sometimes the term Metahistory is also used. But it implies going beyond, a transcendence of history and in this sense it is equated with metaphysics and theology. Sometimes historical time is distinguished from metahistorical eternity.\"</ref>\n\n==Approaches==\nHow a historian approaches historical events is one of the most important decisions within historiography. It is commonly recognised by historians that, in themselves, individual historical facts dealing with names, dates and places are not particularly meaningful. Such facts will only become useful when assembled with other historical evidence, and the process of assembling this evidence is understood as a particular historiographical approach.\n\nThe most influential historiographical approaches are:\n\n* [[Business history]]\n* [[Comparative history]]\n* [[Cultural history]]\n* [[Diplomatic history]]\n* [[Economic history]]\n* [[Environmental history]], a relatively new field\n* [[Ethnohistory]]\n* [[Gender history]] including [[Woman's history]], [[Family history]], [[Feminist history]]\n* [[History of medicine|History of Medicine]]\n* [[History of Religion]] and [[Church history|Church History]]; the history of theology is usually handled under [[Theology]]\n* [[Intellectual History]] and [[History of ideas]]\n* [[Labor history (discipline)|Labor history]]\n* [[Local History]] and [[Microhistory]]\n* [[Marxist historiography]] and [[Historical materialism]]\n* [[Military history]], including naval and air\n* [[Oral history]]\n* [[Political history]]\n* [[Public history]], especially museums and historic preservation\n* [[Quantitative history]], [[Cliometrics]] (in economic history); [[Prosopography]] using statistics to study biographies\n* [[History of religions]]\n* [[Historiography of science]] \n* [[Social history]] and [[People's history|History from below]]; along with the French version the [[Annales school|''Annales'' school]] and the German [[Bielefeld School]]\n* [[Subaltern Studies]], Regarding post-colonial India\n* [[Urban history]]\n** [[American urban history]]\n* [[Whig history]], History as the story of continuous progress\n* [[World history]]\n\n===Related fields===\nImportant related fields include:\n* [[Antiquarian]]ism\n* [[Genealogy]]\n* [[Numismatics]]\n* [[Intellectual history]]\n* [[Paleography]]\n* [[Philosophy of history]]\n* [[Pseudohistory]]\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[List of historians by area of study]]\n* [[Historical significance]]\n* [[National memory]]\n\n===Methods===\n* [[Archival research]]\n* [[Auxiliary sciences of history]]\n* [[Historical method]]\n* [[List of historians]], inclusive of most major historians\n** [[List of historians by area of study]]\n* [[List of history journals]]\n* [[Philosophy of history]]\n* [[Popular history]]\n** [[Primary source]]&nbsp;\u2013 documents, correspondence, diaries\n*** [[Secondary source]]&nbsp;\u2013 interpretations, written history\n**** [[Tertiary source]]&nbsp;\u2013 textbooks and encyclopedias\n* [[Public history]], including museums and historical preservation\n* [[Historical revisionism]]\n* [[Shared historical authority]]\n* [[v:Topic:Historiography|Historiography at Wikiversity]], where it is part of the [[v:School:History|School of History]]\n\n===Topics===\n* [[Historiography of Argentina]]\n* [[Atlantic history]]\n* [[Historiography of Canada]]\n* [[Chinese historiography]]\n* [[Classics]]\n** [[Greek historiography]] \n*** [[Historiography of Alexander the Great]]\n** [[Roman historiography]] \n*** [[Historiography of the fall of the Western Roman Empire]]\n* [[Historiography of the Cold War]]\n* [[Historiography of the French Revolution]]\n** [[Annales school|''Annales'' school]], in France\n* [[Historiography of Germany]] \n** [[Bielefeld School]], in Germany\n* [[History of India#Historiography]]\n** [[Historiography of the fall of the Mughal Empire]]\n* [[Historiography of early Islam]]\n* [[Historiography of Japan]]\n* [[Historiography of Korea]]\n** [[Korean nationalist historiography]]\n* [[History of Latin America|Latin American History]]\n* [[Middle Ages]]\n** [[Historiography of early Christianity]]\n** [[Historiography of feudalism#Historiography|Historiography of feudalism]]\n** [[Dark Ages (historiography)]]\n** [[Historiography of the Crusades]]\n* [[Historiography and nationalism]]\n* [[Historiography of Switzerland]]\n* [[Historiography in the Soviet Union]]\n* [[Historiography of the United States]]\n** [[Frontier Thesis]]\n* [[Historiography of the United Kingdom]]\n** [[Historiography of Scotland]]\n** [[Historiography of the British Empire]]\n* [[World history]]\n* [[Historiography of the causes of World War I]]\n* [[Historiography of World War II]]\n** [[Historiography of the Battle of France]], 1940\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Theory===\n* Appleby, Joyce, Lynn Hunt & Margaret Jacob, ''Telling the Truth About History''.

He left the series after the movie, focusing on his other projects, ''[[Samurai Jack]]'' and ''[[Star Wars: Clone Wars (2003 TV series)|Star Wars: Clone Wars]]''.\n\nProduction on a third season began in 2001 with [[Chris Savino]] taking over as creative director and later producer. It premiered worldwide on November 16, 2001, during Cartoon Network's \"Dexter Goes Global\" marathon.<ref name=\"global\">{{cite news|title=Dexter Goes Global in Worldwide Marathon|first=Leigh|last=Godfrey|url=http://www.awn.com/news/television/dexter-goes-global-worldwide-marathon|date=November 16, 2001|publisher=[[Animation World Network]]|accessdate=2013-06-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021213630/http://www.awn.com/news/television/dexter-goes-global-worldwide-marathon|archive-date=October 21, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> The third-season episode \"Poppa Wheely/A Mom Cartoon/The Mock Side of the Moon\" is the first to feature [[Christine Cavanaugh]]'s replacement [[Candi Milo]] as the voice of Dexter.

A fourth and final season consisting of 13 episodes aired from November 22, 2002, to November 20, 2003. In total there have been 78 episodes and a television movie across 4 seasons.\n\nA previously unaired episode called \"[[Rude Removal]]\" was originally shown only at certain comic conventions that Tartakovsky attended beginning in 1998.

In this season, Allison Moore, the voice actor for Dee Dee, was replaced by [[Kat Cressida]], save for a few episodes. \"Last But Not Beast\", the second-season finale, was originally supposed to conclude the series in 1998. However, Tartakovsky directed a television movie titled ''[[Dexter's Laboratory: Ego Trip]]'' which aired on Cartoon Network on December 10, 1999. He left the series after the movie, focusing on his other projects, ''[[Samurai Jack]]'' and ''[[Star Wars: Clone Wars (2003 TV series)|Star Wars: Clone Wars]]''.\n\nProduction on a third season began in 2001 with [[Chris Savino]] taking over as creative director and later producer. It premiered worldwide on November 16, 2001, during Cartoon Network's \"Dexter Goes Global\" marathon.<ref name=\"global\">{{cite news|title=Dexter Goes Global in Worldwide Marathon|first=Leigh|last=Godfrey|url=http://www.awn.com/news/television/dexter-goes-global-worldwide-marathon|date=November 16, 2001|publisher=[[Animation World Network]]|accessdate=2013-06-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021213630/http://www.awn.com/news/television/dexter-goes-global-worldwide-marathon|archive-date=October 21, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> The third-season episode \"Poppa Wheely/A Mom Cartoon/The Mock Side of the Moon\" is the first to feature [[Christine Cavanaugh]]'s replacement [[Candi Milo]] as the voice of Dexter.

It still plays a ritual role, the building complex also has a community seat and a kosher restaurant. It is included in the list of monuments in Romania under the number BV-II-m-A-11515.\n\n== History ==\nJews already lived in Brasov in the 15th century, but they did not officially get a settlement permit until 1807. Initially, Chapel Street Hospital was used as a religious building from which the Saxon Lutherans moved after a fire. The Jewish community of Brasov, which initially had four families, was formed in 1826 and the prayer house was moved to the Lakatos-zwinger area (where the ethnographic museum is today), where a school was established. Brasov was the first Saxon city in which Jewish merchants also played a role; they also wrote a petition which later allowed Jews to settle in other cities in Transylvania. From 1856, their house of worship was in the Joiner-zwinger, at the site of the later Reformed Church, where today the Aro Palace is.\n\nAfter 1868 the community became neologic, then in 1877 it split into an innovative neologist (led by Aronshon L\u00f6bl) and a nationalist orthodox (led by Adler Bernhard). Each community has built its own prayer house. The neolog synagogue was built between 1899 and 1901, at Orphanage Street 29, according to the plans of [[Lip\u00f3t Baumhorn]]. It cost 1.2 million crowns to build, more than the magnificent Szeged Synagogue. Rabbi Ludovic Pap-Rosenberg inaugurated on August 20, 1901; hundreds of soldiers took care of the order during the ceremony because of the bloodblazing charge.\n\nIn the first four decades of the 20th century, the city's Jewish community more than quadrupled to 3,494. In 1912, an ITO organization (Territorial Company) was set up to imagine the future of Jewry in Argentina. In 1921, a Jewish sports association was founded under the name Ivria, and soon another was founded under the name Hakoach. Their cemetery is on Cri\u0219an Street.\n\nIn November 1940, the Iron Guards damaged the synagogue, smashing the vitrals, the furniture, and the organ. Until 1944 the building was used as a gym, and after the Second World War it was renovated. In 1949 the neologist and the Orthodox became united again. After the establishment of the State of Israel, the majority of the Jews emigrated, and their number in the city decreased considerably.\n\nIn 2001, on the centenary of its opening, the synagogue was renovated. Because today's community is more orthodox than it used to be, the bane was moved to the center of the main ship by moving the benches and cutting them back. In August 2014, a monument was unveiled in the courtyard to commemorate the Transylvanian victims of the Holocaust. In October 2014, the synagogue was renamed Beth Israel (House of Israel). The community currently has about 230 members.\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe 657 square meter synagogue is a three-nave Neo-Gothic style with Moorish elements. Stained-glass windows show the coat-of-arms of 32 Israeli settlements. The fa\u00e7ade vitrines the sun, and the top of the roof represents the stone table of the Ten Commandments. The memorial plaques in the lobby list the names of the presidents of the Jewish community and the Jews from Brasov who died in the World War. The main ship is separated by rows of columns from the aisles, these pillars have balconies where women can sit. The Synagogue is open Monday to Friday for an entrance fee.\n\nThe building complex, at Orava House 27, has a community headquarters, a kosher restaurant, a medical office and an aid organization.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\n20140627 Bra\u015fov 158.jpg\n20140627 Bra\u015fov 160.jpg\n20140627 Bra\u015fov 159.jpg\nBRAS-SinanogaNeologa01.jpg\nSinagoga Neolog\u0103 (interior).jpg\nSynagogue brasov inside.jpg\nSynagogue - panoramio (4).jpg\nSinagoga Brasov Vitraliu.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n== Sources ==\n*{{cite book |author1=Mana\u021be |author2=Fiul |author3=Oprea |title=Comunitatea evreilor din Bra\u0219ov |year=2007 |publisher=Transilvania Expres |location=Brass\u00f3 |language=ro |isbn=9789738196766}}\n*{{cite book |author=Klein Rudolf |title=Zsinag\u00f3g\u00e1k Magyarorsz\u00e1gon 1782\u20131918 - Fejl\u0151d\u00e9st\u00f6rt\u00e9net, tipol\u00f3gia \u00e9s \u00e9p\u00edt\u00e9szeti jelent\u0151s\u00e9g |year=2011 |publisher=Terc |location=Budapest |isbn=9789639968011}}\n*{{cite book |last=Aldea |first=Vasile |title=Cr\u00e2mpeie din Bra\u0219ovul de ieri \u0219i azi |page=386\u2013389 |year=2016 |publisher=Haco International |location=Vidomb\u00e1k |language=ro |isbn=9789737706416}}\n\n[[Category:Synagogues in Romania]]\n\n{{improve categories|date=April 2020}}\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|{{refimprove|date=April 2020}}{{copy edit|date=April 2020}}}}\n\n[[File:Brasov_Synagogue.jpg|300px|thumb]]\n\n'''The Beth Israel Synagogue in Brasov''' (Hebrew: \u05d1\u05d9\u05ea \u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc), a '''neological synagogue''' in the vernacular language, stands at 29 \u00c1rvah\u00e1z Street in the city center, behind the street front, on a plot surrounded by houses.

Up to 80% of the produced pulp is used for specialty papers (including 95% [[cigarette paper]]). Only about 20% goes into the standard pulp area and are here in mostly lower quality wood pulp (unpurified [[tow]] with high [[hemp hurds|hurd]] content).

As of 1994, most of the French hemp crop was used to make rolling paper, currency, and high quality paper for Bibles ([[India paper]]).<ref>{{citation|title=The European Hemp Industry: Cultivation, processing and applications for fibres, shivs, seeds and flowers|author1-first=Michael |author1-last=Carus|author2-first=Luis|author2-last=Sarmento|date=May 2016|publisher=European Industrial Hemp Association|url=http://eiha.org/media/2016/05/16-05-17-european-hemp-industry-2013.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{citation|title=Insights of the French Hemp Program|first=Patrick |last=Girouard|year=1994|publisher=REAP Canada|via=Ecological Agriculture Projects website, McGill University|url=https://eap.mcgill.ca/MagRack/SF/Fall%2094%20K.htm|p=5}}</ref>\n\n==Fiber sources==\n{{See also|Wood pulp|Deinking}}\n\nBefore the industrialisation of paper production the most common fibre source was recycled fibres from used textiles, called rags.

This storage requires a lot of (mostly manual) handling of the bulky stalk bundles. Another issue is that the entire hemp plant cannot be economically prepared for paper production. While the wood products industry uses nearly 100% of the fiber from harvested trees, only about 25% of the dried hemp stem\u2014the bark, called [[bast fibre|bast]]\u2014contains the long, strong fibers desirable for paper production.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bc.com/environment/positionNonwood.jsp |title=Boise: Nonwood Alternatives to Wood Fiber in Paper |publisher=bc.com |date=2007-07-08 |accessdate=2013-11-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070708092411/http://www.bc.com/environment/positionNonwood.jsp |archivedate=July 8, 2007 }}</ref> All this accounts for a high raw material cost. Hemp pulp is bleached with [[hydrogen peroxide]], a process today also commonly used for wood pulp.\n\n===Market share===\nThe use of hemp fiber for paper production represented 90% of the (legal) use of hemp in Europe at the end of the 1990s, with the release of the cultivation of industrial hemp in other parts of Europe in recent years, the share of the increase in other types of use (textiles, natural [[Fibre reinforced plastic|fiber reinforced plastics]]) is currently around 70 to 80% and is still the most important hemp product line in Europe. Today, hemp is used for cigarette paper among other things in [[Spain]] and in [[United Kingdom]].<ref name=\"Carus et al. 2008\">Carus et al. (2008)</ref>\n\nAround the year 2000, the production volume for flax and hemp pulp totalled 25,000 to 30,000 tonnes per year, which was produced from about 37,000 to 45,000 tonnes of fibers. Up to 80% of the produced pulp is used for specialty papers (including 95% [[cigarette paper]]). Only about 20% goes into the standard pulp area and are here in mostly lower quality wood pulp (unpurified [[tow]] with high [[hemp hurds|hurd]] content). In the case of hemp pulp alone, the proportion of specialty papers is probably around 99%. The market is considered to be saturated, so no or only low growth in this area is predicted.<ref>Ivan B\u00f3csa, Michael Karus, Daike Lohmeyer: The cultivation of hemp.

{"title_page": "Congo Free State propaganda war", "text_new": "[[File:Punch congo rubber cartoon.jpg|{{largethumb}}|Cartoon in ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'', 1906]]\nThe '''Congo Free State propaganda war''' was a worldwide media [[propaganda]] campaign waged by both [[King Leopold II]] of [[Belgium]] and the critics of the [[Congo Free State]]. Leopold was very astute in using the media to support his virtual private control of the Congo. [[Edmund Dene Morel]] successfully campaigned against Leopold and focused public attention on the violence of Leopold's rule. Morel used newspaper accounts, pamphlets, and books to publish evidence from reports, eye-witness testimony, and pictures from [[missionaries]] and others involved directly in the Congo.  As Morel gained high-profile supporters, the publicity generated by his campaign eventually forced Leopold to relinquish control of the Congo to the Belgian government.\n\n== Background ==\nThe Congo Free State propaganda war (1884\u20131912) occurred at the height of [[European imperialism]]. Demand for goods drove European imperialism, and (with the important exception of British [[East India Company]] rule in India), the European stake in [[Asia]] was confined largely to trading stations and strategic outposts necessary to protect trade. [[Industrialization]], however, dramatically increased European demand for scarce raw materials. The severe [[Long Depression]] of the 1870s provoked a scramble to develop new markets for European industrial products and financial services. European nations determined to exploit the natural resources of [[Africa]] and develop new markets there.\n\n=== Leopold's acquisition ===\n[[File:Leopold ii garter knight.jpg|thumb|King [[Leopold II of Belgium|Leopold II]] in the late 1800s]]\n\nLeopold thought overseas colonies critically important to becoming a great power, and worked to establish colonial possessions for Belgium. The national legislature did not authorize the colonial enterprise, and Leopold eventually acquired a colony in the Congo for himself with money loaned by the Belgian government for the purpose{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}.\n\nAfter a number of unsuccessful schemes for colonies in Africa and Asia, he organized a private [[holding company]] in 1876, disguised as an international scientific and philanthropic association, called the [[Association Internationale Africaine|International African Society]] (IAA). It had a flag and an executive council which he chaired. Leopold formulated and used the following explicit goals of the IAA to justify his ambitions in the Congo:\n\n*to suppress the slave trade in Equatorial Africa,\n*to unite the native tribes,\n*to modernize the peoples of the [[Congo River]],\n*to bring morality and an understanding of sin to the natives,\n*and to advance the economy of the region.\n\nIn 1878 Leopold's holding company hired the British explorer [[Henry Morton Stanley]] to establish a colony in the region of the [[Kingdom of Kongo|Congo]].<ref>Hochschild, Adam: ''King Leopold's Ghost: A Story of Greed, Terror, and Heroism in Colonial Africa'', Mariner Books, 1998. pp. 62. {{ISBN|0-330-49233-0}}.</ref> Before Stanley left for Africa, Leopold created an exploratory committee with funds of a million francs in gold. Chaired by Stanley, it promised to abide by the IAA's goals set forth by Leopold.\n\n[[File:LocationCongoFreeState.png|thumb|Location of the [[Congo Free State]]]]\n[[File:Democratic Republic of the Congo (orthographic projection).svg|thumb|The area of the Congo Free State]]\nDuring the spring of 1884, Leopold started a campaign to convince the [[Great Powers]] that the Congo Free State should be a [[sovereign nation]] and he its head of state. Much diplomatic maneuvering resulted in the [[Berlin Conference]] of 1884\u201385, at which representatives of fourteen European countries and the [[United States]] recognized Leopold as sovereign of most of the area he and Stanley had laid claim to.\n\nAfter the conference Leopold told the members and reporters:\n\n{{Quote|text=To open up civilization the only part of our globe which it has not yet penetrated, to pierce the darkness in which entire populations are enveloped, is, I venture to say, a crusade worthy of its age of progress \u2026 Need I say that, in bringing you to Brussels, I have not been influenced by selfish views.<ref>Dunne, Kevin C. ''Imagining the Congo: The International Relations of Identity,'' New York: MacMillan, 2003, p. 21</ref>}}\n\n==== Using public diplomacy ====\nLeopold \"conceived the idea of a Congo Free State, with himself as the Sovereign ruler.\"<ref>Jesse Siddall Reeves. \"The International Beginnings of the Congo Free State.\" Johns Hopkins University ''Studies in Historical and Political Science'' 12, no. 11\u201312 (1894), p. 26</ref> The name suggested individual, economic, and religious freedoms. Leopold began a publicity campaign in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], drawing attention to [[Portugal]]'s slavery record to distract critics. He offered to drive slave traders from the Congo basin. He also secretly told British merchant houses that if he had formal control of the Congo, he would give Britain the same most-favored-nation status Portugal offered. At the same time, Leopold promised [[Otto von Bismarck]] he would not give any one nation special status, and that German traders would be as welcome as any other.\n\nLeopold then offered [[France]] the Association's support for French ownership of the entire northern bank of the Congo River, and sweetened the deal by proposing that if his personal wealth proved insufficient to hold the entire Congo, as seemed inevitable, then the Congo would revert to France.\n\nLeopold sent United States President [[Chester A. Arthur]] carefully edited copies of cloth-and-trinket treaties obtained by Stanley. He proposed that, as an entirely disinterested humanitarian body, the Association administer the Congo for the good of all, handing power to the local inhabitants as soon as they were ready for that grave responsibility. He worked to convince the United States, with its growing economic and military power, to recognize the treaties and the Congo Free State. Leopold's men told Southern congressmen that the Congo Free State could be a new home for [[freedmen]] from the Deep South. The politicians loved the idea. He promised the President open and free trade.\n\nIn April, the [[U.S. Congress]] decided that the treaties had legal standing and that the Congo was a [[sovereign state]] under the Belgian king. France's recognition soon followed, and then Germany, and soon all the other European nations. Since the IAA was seen as a legitimate government of a recognized sovereign state, Bismarck invited King Leopold to discuss African affairs with the Great Powers of Europe.\n\nOn November 15, 1884, the International Conference met to resolve \"the African question\" concerning the disposition of African territories among European powers. After long debate and ten sittings, the Great Powers agreed on borders for their colonies, without input from any African leader or thought to the deeply rooted ethnic and tribal politics. The Congo Free State encompassed nearly {{convert|1000000|sqmi|km2|order=flip}}, the largest claim in central Africa.\n\n===\"Red Rubber\"===\n[[File:Nsala of Wala in Congo looks at the severed hand and foot of his five-year old daughter, 1904.jpg|thumb|A father stares at a hand and a foot of his five-year-old daughter, severed in punishment by the ''Force Publique''.

The book was illustrated with photographs by [[Alice Seeley Harris|Harris]].]]\n\nLeopold profited from the ivory of the resource-rich Congo and even more from its [[rubber]], a primary product of the Congo. [[Congo rubber|Rubber vines]] grew throughout central Africa; but harvesting rubber from a vine was more difficult than that from a tree. So prices for African rubber went up, and Asian producers of less expensive rubber gained market share.\n\nConsequently, Leopold demanded very high productivity from workers and a system of extracting rubber with minimal expense. Leopold's agents used [[forced labor]] or [[slave labor]] to get rubber and ivory, a clear violation of the Berlin Conference Act.<ref>The Berlin Conference, The General Act of Feb 26, 1885. Chap I, VI.</ref> To keep high production numbers constant, Leopold created an army of enforcers called the ''[[Force Publique]]'' (FP) in 1885, when he ordered creation of military and police forces. In 1886, he sent a number of Belgian officers and non-commissioned officers to the territory to create this military force. \n==== Humanitarian disaster ====\n{{main|Atrocities in the Congo Free State}}\nThe Force Publique became slave drivers, forcing people to work for nothing. They also enforced Leopold's law against selling any rubber and ivory to other nations. The FP's methods included mutilation, village destruction, killings, and mass murder to motivate the slaves and locals to higher outputs.{{sfn|Van Reybrouck|2014|p=92}}{{sfn|Renton|Seddon|Zeilig|2007|p=33}} Cutting off right hands and daily slave whippings were most common.{{sfn|Renton|Seddon|Zeilig|2007|p=30}}\n\nThis brutality would later be dubbed \"[[Red#Symbolism|Red]] Rubber\", in reference to the blood of Africans. The FP caused millions of deaths, perhaps tens of millions{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}, and even more widespread mutilation.\n\nLeopold denied knowing any of these details. Belgian professor {{ill|Dani\u00ebl Vangroenweghe|nl}} estimated Leopold gained {{nowrap|1,250 million}} present day{{when|date=December 2010}} [[euro]]s from the exploitation of the Congolese people, mainly from rubber. Other Belgian sources calculated that the profits from the Congolese exploitation prior to 1905 were some {{nowrap|500 million}} present-day euros.{{when|date=December 2010}}.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nRubber yielded huge profits for the state and for companies like the [[Abir Congo Company|Anglo-Belgian India Rubber Company]] (ABIR). The value of ABIR shares went from 500 francs (1892 gold francs) to 15,000 gold francs in 1903. The dividend in 1892 was 1 franc. In 1903 the dividend was 1,200 francs, more than double of the original price of a share.\n\n== The media war ==\n\n=== The missionaries and the Congo ===\nKing Leopold allowed several hundred foreign Protestant missionaries from England, the United States, and Sweden to go to the Congo. Given the goals of the IAA he could hardly refuse offers to \"civilize\" the Africans. The missionaries went to the Congo to evangelize, to fight polygamy, and to create a fear of sin in Africans. But the Congolese would run and hide at the mere sight of a European. \n\nOne British missionary wrote that his African congregation asked, \"Has the Savior you tell us of any power to save us from the rubber trouble?\"{{cn|date=September 2016}} Other missionaries became aware of bloody events around their posts. One Swedish missionary noted a sorrowful song about death and tyranny that many sang at his post.{{cn|date=September 2016}} Some missionaries began to protest the violence through personal letters to Leopold, as well as through letters to newspapers and magazines. Their efforts had little effect in drawing public attention to the situation.\n\n==== William Sheppard ====\n[[File:WHS portrait.jpg|thumb|left|[[William Henry Sheppard|William Sheppard]]]]\n\nIn the late 1880s [[William Henry Sheppard|William Sheppard]], an African-American Protestant missionary, started to write to American newspapers and magazines about the mutilations and murder that he witnessed. With threats of taxation and deportation, Leopold put a stop to Sheppard's writing. Leopold subsequently demanded that missionaries direct all concerns to him and not to the press.\n\n==== E. V. Sj\u00f6blom ====\nSwedish Baptist missionary E. V. Sj\u00f6blom spoke of the atrocities to all who would listen.  In 1896 he published in the Swedish press a detailed article on the Congo's rubber industry, and this was reprinted elsewhere. He spoke about the brutality of the Force Publique at a public meeting attended by the press. Congo State officials counterattacked with newspaper articles, letters, and comments from Leopold in the Belgian and British press, and quickly silenced Sj\u00f6blom. The missionary never spoke up again.\n\n==== George Washington Williams ====\n[[File:George W. Williams from History of Negro Troops.jpg|thumb|alt George Washington Williams|[[George Washington Williams]]<br/>(October 16, 1849 \u2013 August 2, 1891)]]\n\nColonel [[George Washington Williams]] served in the Union army during the Civil War. Williams entered a seminary and became a pastor.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pabook.libraries.psu.edu/palitmap/bios/Williams__George_Washington.html |title=accessed May 8, 2014 |publisher= |access-date=May 9, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515190314/http://pabook.libraries.psu.edu/palitmap/bios/Williams__George_Washington.html |archive-date=May 15, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> After moving to Washington, D.C., he started a national black newspaper, the ''Commoner''. The newspaper folded and so did one in Cincinnati. He became a well-respected historian through his writings and lectures.\n\nIn 1889, Williams began writing for the European press syndicate. After an interview with Leopold, Williams went to the Congo to see \"[[Christian civilization]]\" in action. In early April 1891 Williams wrote a letter to Leopold entitled ''An Open Letter to His Serene Majesty Leopold II, King of the Belgians and Sovereign of the Independent State of Congo'' about the suffering of the region at the hands of Leopold's agents. The letter helped sway European and American public opinion against the Congo regime.<ref name=\"leos_ghost\">Hochschild, Adam, ''King Leopold's Ghost'', Pan Macmillan, London (1998). {{ISBN|0-330-49233-0}}.</ref> Williams' last pages accuse Leopold of a list of crimes, including manipulation of the general public. He voiced his disbelief: \"How thoroughly I have been disenchanted, disappointed, and disheartened.\"<ref>George Washington Williams, \"An Open Letter to His Serene Majesty Leopold II, King of the Belgians and Sovereign of the Independent State of the Congo\" repr., John Hope Franklin, ''George Washington Williams: A Biography''. [Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1985], 243\u2013254.</ref>\n\nHe then wrote ''A Report upon the Congo-State and Country to the President of the Republic of the United States of America'' describing how Leopold had manipulated the United States. By the time President [[Benjamin Harrison]] received his copy, the open letter had appeared in European and American newspapers. On 14 April 1891, ''The New York Times'' ran a front-page article on the full list of allegations.\n\n==== Leopold vs. Williams ====\nLeopold's Public Relations Minister employed newspaper editors to run articles about the good deeds of Leopold. Leopold himself gave interviews about his dreams and aspirations for the Congo and its future.\n\nOne day after the ''New York Times'' article, Leopold's supporters in America submitted an article that accused Williams of living a lie and committing adultery. The headline read \"HE PROSPERED FOR A TIME, BUT HIS TRUE CHARACTER WAS LEARNED.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1891/04/15/archives/williams-in-middletown-he-prospered-for-a-time-but-his-true.html |title=WILLIAMS IN MIDDLETOWN.; HE PROSPERED FOR A TIME, BUT HIS TRUE CHARACTER WAS LEARNED. |date=15 April 1891 |work=The New York Times}}</ref> During the late summer of 1891 the Belgian Parliament defended Leopold and gave a 45-page report to the press circuit, effectively refuting Williams's accusations. Williams died on August 2 with his reputation tarnished.\n\nThe missionaries who witnessed the atrocities had little media savvy or political clout. The public readily dismissed Leopold's critics from British humanitarian societies as relics of past battles like Abolitionism. And those critics, like the missionaries, became dismissed as people who were always upset about something in some obscure corner of the world.\n\n=== E. D. Morel ===\n[[File:1922_Edmund_Dene_Morel.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[E. D. Morel]]]]\n\nIn 1891, Morel became a clerk with [[Elder Dempster]], a Liverpool shipping firm.  In 1893, to increase his income and support his family, Morel began writing articles against French [[protectionism]], which was damaging Elder Dempster's business. Influenced by [[Mary Kingsley]], an English traveller and writer who showed sympathy for African peoples and respect for different cultures, he became critical of the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]] for not supporting African decolonisation movements.\n\nElder Dempster had a shipping contract with the [[Congo Free State]] for the run between [[Antwerp]] and [[Boma, Kongo Central|Boma]]. Groups such the [[Aborigines' Protection Society]] had already begun a campaign against atrocities in Congo. Due to his command of French, Morel was often sent to [[Belgium]], where he saw internal accounts of the Congo Free State held by Elder Dempster. Knowing that ships from Belgium to the Congo carried only guns, chains, ordnance, and explosives, but no commercial goods, while ships arriving from the colony came back full of valuable products such as raw [[rubber]] and [[ivory]], made him realise Congo Free State's exploitative nature.\n\n==== Newspapers ====\n''West African Mail'', the main media outlet for Morel, started as a small newspaper consisting of Morel's articles, letters from missionaries, maps, cartoons, and pictures; all \"to meet the rapidly growing interest in west and central African questions\".<ref>Hochschild, King Leopold's Ghost, 186</ref> [[John Holt (businessman)|John Holt]], a businessman and Morel's long time friend, helped fund the startup of the newspaper. Later other supporters invested.\n\nMorel wrote a five-part series entitled ''Trading Monopolies in West Africa''. He first wrote stories pertaining to free trade and native rights.\n\n<blockquote>Free Trade in West Africa, free trade for all; free trade for the Englishmen in a French colony, and in a German colony\u2026 There is plenty of room for the free, unfettered commerce of all the Powers of Europe of the Western Continent of Africa, and the greater(the natives), the attractions given to the trade in an individual colony\u2026 the more certain the contentment and the producing power of its inhabitants.<ref>E. D. Morel. \"Trading Monopolies in West Africa\". ''West African Mail''. [Liverpool 1903] (p. 35)</ref></blockquote>\n\nBut then he began to write about slavery, using adjectives like evil, bloody, vicious, horrific and violent:<ref>E. D. Morel. ''The West African Mail''. 1903</ref>\n\n* \"The rubber shipped home by the Congo companies\u2026 is stained with blood of hundreds of [[negro]]es.\"\n* \"This hideous structure of sordid [[wickedness]],\" he called it.\n* \"Blood is smeared all over the Congo State, its history is blood-stained, its deeds are bloody, the edifice it has reared is cemented in blood\u2014the blood of unfortunate negroes, spilled freely with the most sordid of all motives, monetary gain.\"<ref>E.D. Morel. Trading Monopolies. 9\u201310</ref>\n\nMorel also published in major British and Belgian papers. A book entitled ''Civilization in Congo-land'', by [[H.R. Fox Bourne]], secretary of the [[Aborigines Protection Society]], published in January 1903, reinforced Morel's argument. Various organizations passed resolutions demanding Government action. [[Sir Charles Dilke]] took many of these concerns to [[British Parliament|Parliament]] for discussion.\n\n==== Pamphlets ====\nIn 1903 Morel wrote his first pamphlet, ''The Congo Horrors'', which reached a larger general public than before. He emphasized the religious implications, free trade abuses, and accused Leopold. \"It has come to my conclusion that the murders and profiteering of the Congo are a result of neglect to civilize, and King Leopold is the proprietor.\"<ref>E.D. Morel. The Congo Horrors. [Liverpool: January 15, 1903.] (pg 5)</ref>  This pamphlet caught the eye of high British officials such as [[Sir Charles Dilke]] and [[Roger Casement]].\n\nMorel continued to write pieces such as ''The Scandal of the Congo, The Treatment of Women and Children of the Congo'' (published in America in the ''African Studies Journal''), and ''The New African Slavery'' (published in the International Union of London). They contained information and testimony from the missionaries of the brutality. The public began to pressure Parliament to do something about the atrocities.\n\nLater in 1903, Morel brought out a pamphlet of 112 pages entitled ''The Congo Slave State'', perhaps the strongest and fiercest indictment published. It contained a full and detailed description of Leopold's system in all the divisions of the Congo. It also had maps, reports from Parliament, and descriptions of atrocities. Sir Charles Dilke introduced copies of the pamphlet into Parliament. It caused considerable sensation, and resolutions passed against slavery in the Congo.\n\n==== Books ====\n[[File:Red rubber frontpage.jpg|thumb|left|Morel's expos\u00e9 ''Red Rubber''<ref>{{cite book|title=Red Rubber: The story of the rubber slave trade which flourished on the Congo for twenty years, 1890\u20131910|first=E.D.|last=Morel|authorlink= E.D. Morel |url=https://archive.org/details/redrubberstoryof00more}}</ref>]]\n\nBefore 1904, Morel released two books pertaining to [[West Africa]]. The first book, entitled ''Affairs of West Africa'',<ref>{{cite web|title=Affairs of West Africa|first=E. D. |last=Morel|authorlink= E.D. Morel|url=https://archive.org/details/affairsofwestafr00more}}</ref> discussed the history, inhabitants, flora and fauna, physical characteristics, industries, and trade and finances of the area; all from a man who'd never gone to West Africa. He got his information from traders and shipping crews during his days working for Elder Dempster, and from his missionary contacts. Morel concluded his book with attacks on Leopold and the Congo Free State administration. He contrasted the Congo Free State to the success of the French Congo, commemorating the French administration for their efforts within their West African colonies. He then asked for sympathy and understanding, from the English and French, on the issue of West Africa.\n\t\nNewspapers reviews were mixed. In ''The Daily Chronicle'' Sir Harry Johnston wrote:\n\n<blockquote>Mr. Morel's indictment is one of the most terrible things ever written, if true.<ref>Sir Harry Johnston. A Book Review. The Daily Chronicle. [1903]</ref></blockquote>\n\n''The Times'' also provided a glowing review of the book:\n\n<blockquote>It is with great satisfaction that the public will welcome a contribution to our general knowledge on the subject\u2026 The sufferings of which the picture was given to the world in [[Uncle Tom's Cabin]] are as nothing to those which Mr. Morel represents to be habitual accomplishments of the acquisition of rubber and ivory by the Belgian companies.<ref>The Times [1903]</ref></blockquote>\n\nPositive reviews helped create readership for his writings. A bad review from the ''Morning Post'' pertained to the comparison of the French Congo to Leopold's Congo Free State. Morel responded with another book, ''The British Case in the French Congo'', released three months later, in which he said he admired the French efforts, and again blamed the Congo Free State for the evil in West Africa. Even the ''Morning Post'' praised the second book. The public demanded government action. Thus on May 20, 1903 Parliament passed a resolution to allow the British Government to negotiate with the Powers over the matter. Parliament noted that \"great gratitude was due\" to Morel for creating public awareness.<ref>Cocks, ''The Story of the Congo Free State'', p. 96</ref>\n\nHis third book, ''King Leopold's Rule in Africa'',<ref>{{cite book|title=King Leopold's Rule in Africa |first=E. D. |last=Morel|authorlink= E.D. Morel|url= https://archive.org/details/kingleopoldsrule00moreuoft}}</ref> had photographs of mutilated women and children. Though he mostly let the pictures speak for themselves, he wrote effectively. \"Over and over again in his book did Morel hammer in the argument.\"<ref>Cocks, ''The Story of the Congo Free State'', p. 106</ref> Morel argued that the world must come together to fight for the end of the abuses.\n\n<blockquote>In the name of humanity, of common decency and pity, for honour's sake, if for no other cause, will not the Anglo-Saxon race \u2013 the Governments and the peoples of Great Britain and the United States, who between them are primarily responsible for the creation of the Congo State \u2013 make up their minds to handle this monstrous outrage resolutely, and so point the way, and set an example which others would then be compelled to follow? In that hope, with an ever present consciousness of inadequacy to portray the greatness of the evil and the greatness of responsibility, the author submits this volume to the public.<ref>E. D. Morel, ''King Leopold's Rule of Africa'', New York: Funk and Wagnalls Company, 1905, p. 101.</ref></blockquote>\n\nHis words and facts from the book appeared in book reviews all over Europe and the US. The reviewers described the horrific pictures and stories in full detail.\n\n==== Congo Reform Association ====\n[[File:Casement Roger.jpg|thumb|right|180px|right|[[Roger Casement]]]]\n\nAs Morel's writings stirred public feelings for the \"Congo Question\" within Great Britain, Parliament created an international commission to investigate. [[Roger Casement]], a British Consul to Africa and an acquaintance of Morel, went to the Congo and wrote a report for the British Government. Casement interviewed missionaries, natives, riverboat captains, and railroad workers and returned with a [[Casement Report|report]] of the most appalling events ever described.\n\nMany considered the report the most damning exposure ever of exploitation in Africa. A respected British Consul, chosen by the British Foreign Office, had written the thirty-nine pages of testimony and 23-page index of facts. The report produced a profound and widespread feeling in Britain that the administrative system of the Congo State must be reformed. The British Government commended Casement for his work and knighted him. Morel published the [[Casement Report]] in ''The West African Mail''. Newspapers around the world reported on the Casement Report.\n\nCasement and Morel met in Dublin to discuss the situation. Casement convinced Morel to form an organization to combat Leopold's abuses in the Congo. In November 1903, the [[Congo Reform Association]] (CRA) emerged. Casement put forward \u00a3100 as a start up fund. Morel went back to Liverpool to begin the new organization. He drew inspiration from Conrad's ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'', and called it \"the most powerful thing ever written on the subject\".<ref>Catherine Wynne, ''The Colonial Conan Doyle: British Imperialism, Irish Nationalism, and the Gothic'', London: Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002, p. 27.</ref> Casement deliberately absented himself from the launch of the Congo Reform Association at the Philharmonic Hall in Liverpool on March 23, 1904 because he did not want his celebrity to be the only reason people joined.\n\nThe founding manifesto began with an impressive list of names including the African businessman and entrepreneur [[John Holt (businessman)|John Holt]], the historian [[John Morley]], the Presbyterian Minister Reverend [[Reginald John Campbell|R. J. Campbell]] and the Quaker philanthropist [[William Adlington Barrow Cadbury|W. A. Cadbury]] of the Cadbury Chocolate Corp. Others included four bishops and a dozen influential peers of the realm.\n\nThe manifesto called for \"secure just and humane treatment of the inhabitants of the Congo State, and restoration of the rights to the land and of their individual freedom\".<ref>Roger Casement, ''The Casement Report'', p. 34.</ref> No more than a week later, the [[Massachusetts Commission for International Justice]] organized the American branch of the Congo Reform Association with members including [[Mark Twain]], [[Booker T. Washington]], and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]].\n\nIn September 1904, Morel arrived in New York for his American campaign, with a petition entitled ''The Memorial''.  The memorial contained signatures by all the members of the CRA. The purpose of the trip could be explained by Morel's own words during an interview for the ''New York Herald'' in 1903. When asked by the interviewer \"Why America?\" Morel answered:\n\n<blockquote>America has a peculiar and very clear responsibility in the matter, inasmuch as the American Government was the first to recognize the status of the International Association (later the Congo State), and thereby paved the way for similar action on the part of the European Powers\u2026 It is to be hoped that President Roosevelt and the American people may help undo the grieves wrong, which was thereby unknowingly inflicted upon the native inhabitants of the Congo territories.</blockquote>\n\nBefore Morel left for America he submitted a copy of the memorial to ''[[The New York Times]]'', the ''[[New York Post]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', and other press syndicates. The CRA and Morel hoped that before his arrival there would be strong public support from the American citizens. All the newspapers covered his arrival and displayed excerpts of the memorial. His articulate speeches throughout New England earned Morel an audience with President [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. The ''New York Post'' covered the visit with a full page, two-column article. Through the continuous newspaper coverage Americans became curious about Morel and the \"Congo Question\". On October 7 Morel spoke in Boston about the International Peace Congress. His speech was compelling and motivating, and helped focus American public attention on the Congo.\n\n<blockquote>The errand which has brought me to the United States is a very simple one. It is to appeal to you on behalf of the oppressed and persecuted peoples of the Congo, for whose present unhappy condition you, in America, and we, in England, have a great moral responsibility, from which we cannot escape and from which in honour we should not attempt to escape\u2026 It is my privilege to ask you who are met here in the cause of peace whether you will not lead a helping hand in staying the cruel and destructive wars \u2013 if the murder of helpless men and women can be dignified by such a name\u2026 In appealing to you on behalf of those millions of helpless Africans\u2026 It is a great responsibility that you have. If our duty is clear, surely yours is also clear. The African slave trade has been revived, and is in full swing in the Congo today. I ask you to help us to root it up and fling it out of Africa, and just as I have no doubt of the greatness and loftiness of your ideals, so I have no doubt of what your answer will be.<ref>''The Boston Globe'', 7 Oct 1904.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIt would take two more years for President Roosevelt and Congress to get involved. In a letter to [[Henry Cabot Lodge]], Roosevelt wrote: \"The only tomfoolery that anyone seems bent on is that about the Congo Free State outrages, and that is imbecile rather than noxious.\"<ref>Peter Diagn and L. H. Gann, ''The United States and Africa: A History'', Cambridge: University Press, 1987, p. 195.</ref> Overwhelmed by public pressure, Congress in 1906 took a stand against Leopold and demanded an end to the Congo Free State.\n\n=== Leopold's counter campaign ===\n{{Denial of mass killings}}\n[[File:An AnswerTwain.JPG|thumb|200px|Front cover of ''An Answer to Mark Twain'', anonymously published in Brussels (1907) in reply to ''King Leopold's Soliloquy''. Pictured are [[Mark Twain]] and [[E. D. Morel]].]]\nLeopold ordered{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} counterattacks refuting all the claims that Morel made. He had his propaganda machine write articles for major newspapers, including the ''[[New York Times]]'', as well as numerous letters to the editor.\n\nDiscrediting Morel and the CRA had not worked. Leopold commissioned an internal investigation of the Congo to prove to the public that he cared.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} A committee of Congo officials issued reports that denied any atrocities. Morel collected letters, photos, and testimony from the Congolese, for an extensive media blitz of [[pamphlets]], [[newspaper]] articles, letters and books.\n\nLeopold's response included articles countering the claims, but he also sent agents to spy on Morel during his American visit. [[Mark Twain]] released '' [[King Leopold's Soliloquy]] '', which talked about the abuses and Leopold's denial. Twain wrote it from the perspective of Leopold. \"They burst out and call me 'the king with ten million murders on his soul{{'\"}}<ref>Mark Twain, ''King Leopold's Soliloquy: A Defense of His Congo Rule'', New York: P.R. Warren, 1905, p. 2.</ref>  Throughout the book, Twain portrays Leopold as guilty and evil. \"Well...no matter, I did beat the Yankees, anyway! There is comfort in that. [Reads with a mocking smile, the President's Order of Recognition of April 22, 1884]\". Twain's account presents the image of a disingenuous Leopold plotting and scheming to keep the truth from coming out.\n\nLeopold's agents countered with letters to the editor and a book entitled ''An Answer to Mark Twain''. In the book they call Twain and Morel liars and manipulators. \"Truth shines forth in the following pages, which summarily show what the Congo Free State is.\" \"All the Mr. Twain and Morel have said. Lies!\"<ref>Anonymous, ''An Answer to Mark Twain'', New York: A&G Bulens Brothers, 1906, p. 2.</ref> One of Leopold's hired lobbyists, [[Henry I. Kowalsky]] caused a sensation in December 1906 by making public all the communications between himself, Leopold, and the Congo State.<ref name=\"leos_ghost\"/>\n\nLeopold finally appointed a commission of inquiry, to investigate specific charges of the atrocities and reported abuses. The commission included members of the Belgian Parliament and lower officials in the government.\n\n==== The downfall ====\nLeopold released press statements about the commission hoping to quell the public uproar. However, Leopold wanted a private, not a published, report.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} The commission returned with the most evidence of abuse yet \u2013 interviews with over a hundred natives and numerous missionaries, documents from the Force Publique detailing deaths and mutilations inflicted, and documents from the Congo State administration proving that Leopold profited more than he reported.\n\nThe CRA obtained the report, and published it in ''The West African Mail'', ''The New York Times'', the Associated Press, and European press agencies. The report, ''Evidence Laid Before the Congo Commission of Inquiry'', also became a pamphlet distributed by the CRA throughout Europe and the United States. Appointed by Leopold himself, the commission reported horrific testimony, facts on deaths and mutilations, and letters obtained from the Congo Administration documenting the abuses. Leopold could not refute his own commission's findings. Leopold yielded the Congo Free State to Belgium in exchange for a financial settlement in 1908.  He died, aged 74, the following year and was never judged.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Political warfare]]\n* [[Public diplomacy]]\n* [[Public relations]]\n\n== References ==\n<!--- See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes on how to create references using  tags which will then appear here automatically -->\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n=== Primary ===\n* Anonymous.

Leopold was very astute in using the media to support his virtual private control of the Congo. [[Edmund Dene Morel]] successfully campaigned against Leopold and focused public attention on the violence of Leopold's rule. Morel used newspaper accounts, pamphlets, and books to publish evidence from reports, eye-witness testimony, and pictures from [[missionaries]] and others involved directly in the Congo.  As Morel gained high-profile supporters, the publicity generated by his campaign eventually forced Leopold to relinquish control of the Congo to the Belgian government.\n\n== Background ==\nThe Congo Free State propaganda war (1884\u20131912) occurred at the height of [[European Imperialism]]. Demand for goods drove European imperialism, and (with the important exception of British [[East India Company]] rule in India), the European stake in [[Asia]] was confined largely to trading stations and strategic outposts necessary to protect trade. [[Industrialization]], however, dramatically increased European demand for scarce raw materials. The severe [[Long Depression]] of the 1870s provoked a scramble to develop new markets for European industrial products and financial services. European nations determined to exploit the natural resources of [[Africa]] and develop new markets there.\n\n=== Leopold's acquisition ===\n[[File:Leopold ii garter knight.jpg|thumb|King [[Leopold II of Belgium|Leopold II]] in the late 1800s]]\n\nLeopold thought overseas colonies critically important to becoming a great power, and worked to establish colonial possessions for Belgium. The national legislature did not authorize the colonial enterprise, and Leopold eventually acquired a colony in the Congo for himself with money loaned by the Belgian government for the purpose{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}.\n\nAfter a number of unsuccessful schemes for colonies in Africa and Asia, he organized a private [[holding company]] in 1876, disguised as an international scientific and philanthropic association, called the [[Association Internationale Africaine|International African Society]] (IAA). It had a flag and an executive council which he chaired. Leopold formulated and used the following explicit goals of the IAA to justify his ambitions in the Congo:\n\n*to suppress the slave trade in Equatorial Africa,\n*to unite the native tribes,\n*to modernize the peoples of the [[Congo River]],\n*to bring morality and an understanding of sin to the natives,\n*and to advance the economy of the region.\n\nIn 1878 Leopold's holding company hired the British explorer [[Henry Morton Stanley]] to establish a colony in the region of the [[Kingdom of Kongo|Congo]].<ref>Hochschild, Adam: ''King Leopold's Ghost: A Story of Greed, Terror, and Heroism in Colonial Africa'', Mariner Books, 1998. pp. 62. {{ISBN|0-330-49233-0}}.</ref> Before Stanley left for Africa, Leopold created an exploratory committee with funds of a million francs in gold. Chaired by Stanley, it promised to abide by the IAA's goals set forth by Leopold.\n\n[[File:LocationCongoFreeState.png|thumb|Location of the [[Congo Free State]]]]\n[[File:Democratic Republic of the Congo (orthographic projection).svg|thumb|The area of the Congo Free State]]\nDuring the spring of 1884, Leopold started a campaign to convince the [[Great Powers]] that the Congo Free State should be a [[sovereign nation]] and he its head of state. Much diplomatic maneuvering resulted in the [[Berlin Conference]] of 1884\u201385, at which representatives of fourteen European countries and the [[United States]] recognized Leopold as sovereign of most of the area he and Stanley had laid claim to.\n\nAfter the conference Leopold told the members and reporters:\n\n{{Quote|text=To open up civilization the only part of our globe which it has not yet penetrated, to pierce the darkness in which entire populations are enveloped, is, I venture to say, a crusade worthy of its age of progress \u2026 Need I say that, in bringing you to Brussels, I have not been influenced by selfish views.<ref>Dunne, Kevin C. ''Imagining the Congo: The International Relations of Identity,'' New York: MacMillan, 2003, p. 21</ref>}}\n\n==== Using public diplomacy ====\nLeopold \"conceived the idea of a Congo Free State, with himself as the Sovereign ruler.\"<ref>Jesse Siddall Reeves. \"The International Beginnings of the Congo Free State.\" Johns Hopkins University ''Studies in Historical and Political Science'' 12, no. 11\u201312 (1894), p. 26</ref> The name suggested individual, economic, and religious freedoms. Leopold began a publicity campaign in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], drawing attention to [[Portugal]]'s slavery record to distract critics. He offered to drive slave traders from the Congo basin. He also secretly told British merchant houses that if he had formal control of the Congo, he would give Britain the same most-favored-nation status Portugal offered. At the same time, Leopold promised [[Otto von Bismarck]] he would not give any one nation special status, and that German traders would be as welcome as any other.\n\nLeopold then offered [[France]] the Association's support for French ownership of the entire northern bank of the Congo River, and sweetened the deal by proposing that if his personal wealth proved insufficient to hold the entire Congo, as seemed inevitable, then the Congo would revert to France.\n\nLeopold sent United States President [[Chester A. Arthur]] carefully edited copies of cloth-and-trinket treaties obtained by Stanley. He proposed that, as an entirely disinterested humanitarian body, the Association administer the Congo for the good of all, handing power to the local inhabitants as soon as they were ready for that grave responsibility. He worked to convince the United States, with its growing economic and military power, to recognize the treaties and the Congo Free State. Leopold's men told Southern congressmen that the Congo Free State could be a new home for [[freedmen]] from the Deep South. The politicians loved the idea. He promised the President open and free trade.\n\nIn April, the [[U.S. Congress]] decided that the treaties had legal standing and that the Congo was a [[sovereign state]] under the Belgian king. France's recognition soon followed, and then Germany, and soon all the other European nations. Since the IAA was seen as a legitimate government of a recognized sovereign state, Bismarck invited King Leopold to discuss African affairs with the Great Powers of Europe.\n\nOn November 15, 1884, the International Conference met to resolve \"the African question\" concerning the disposition of African territories among European powers. After long debate and ten sittings, the Great Powers agreed on borders for their colonies, without input from any African leader or thought to the deeply rooted ethnic and tribal politics. The Congo Free State encompassed nearly {{convert|1000000|sqmi|km2|order=flip}}, the largest claim in central Africa.\n\n===\"Red Rubber\"===\n[[File:Nsala of Wala in Congo looks at the severed hand and foot of his five-year old daughter, 1904.jpg|thumb|A father stares at a hand and a foot of his five-year-old daughter, severed in punishment by the ''Force Publique''.

The book was illustrated with photographs by [[Alice Seeley Harris|Harris]].]]\n\nLeopold profited from the ivory of the resource-rich Congo and even more from its [[rubber]], a primary product of the Congo. [[Congo rubber|Rubber vines]] grew throughout central Africa; but harvesting rubber from a vine was more difficult than that from a tree. So prices for African rubber went up, and Asian producers of less expensive rubber gained market share.\n\nConsequently, Leopold demanded very high productivity from workers and a system of extracting rubber with minimal expense. Leopold's agents used [[forced labor]] or [[slave labor]] to get rubber and ivory, a clear violation of the Berlin Conference Act.<ref>The Berlin Conference, The General Act of Feb 26, 1885. Chap I, VI.</ref> To keep high production numbers constant, Leopold created an army of enforcers called the ''[[Force Publique]]'' (FP) in 1885, when he ordered creation of military and police forces. In 1886, he sent a number of Belgian officers and non-commissioned officers to the territory to create this military force. \n==== Humanitarian disaster ====\n{{main|Atrocities in the Congo Free State}}\nThe Force Publique became slave drivers, forcing people to work for nothing. They also enforced Leopold's law against selling any rubber and ivory to other nations. The FP's methods included mutilation, village destruction, killings, and mass murder to motivate the slaves and locals to higher outputs.{{sfn|Van Reybrouck|2014|p=92}}{{sfn|Renton|Seddon|Zeilig|2007|p=33}} Cutting off right hands and daily slave whippings were most common.{{sfn|Renton|Seddon|Zeilig|2007|p=30}}\n\nThis brutality would later be dubbed \"[[Red#Symbolism|Red]] Rubber\", in reference to the blood of Africans. The FP caused millions of deaths, perhaps tens of millions{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}, and even more widespread mutilation.\n\nLeopold denied knowing any of these details. Belgian professor {{ill|Dani\u00ebl Vangroenweghe|nl}} estimated Leopold gained {{nowrap|1,250 million}} present day{{when|date=December 2010}} [[euro]]s from the exploitation of the Congolese people, mainly from rubber. Other Belgian sources calculated that the profits from the Congolese exploitation prior to 1905 were some {{nowrap|500 million}} present-day euros.{{when|date=December 2010}}.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nRubber yielded huge profits for the state and for companies like the [[Abir Congo Company|Anglo-Belgian India Rubber Company]] (ABIR). The value of ABIR shares went from 500 francs (1892 gold francs) to 15,000 gold francs in 1903. The dividend in 1892 was 1 franc. In 1903 the dividend was 1,200 francs, more than double of the original price of a share.\n\n== The media war ==\n\n=== The missionaries and the Congo ===\nKing Leopold allowed several hundred foreign Protestant missionaries from England, the United States, and Sweden to go to the Congo. Given the goals of the IAA he could hardly refuse offers to \"civilize\" the Africans. The missionaries went to the Congo to evangelize, to fight polygamy, and to create a fear of sin in Africans. But the Congolese would run and hide at the mere sight of a European. \n\nOne British missionary wrote that his African congregation asked, \"Has the Savior you tell us of any power to save us from the rubber trouble?\"{{cn|date=September 2016}} Other missionaries became aware of bloody events around their posts. One Swedish missionary noted a sorrowful song about death and tyranny that many sang at his post.{{cn|date=September 2016}} Some missionaries began to protest the violence through personal letters to Leopold, as well as through letters to newspapers and magazines. Their efforts had little effect in drawing public attention to the situation.\n\n==== William Sheppard ====\n[[File:WHS portrait.jpg|thumb|left|[[William Henry Sheppard|William Sheppard]]]]\n\nIn the late 1880s [[William Henry Sheppard|William Sheppard]], an African-American Protestant missionary, started to write to American newspapers and magazines about the mutilations and murder that he witnessed. With threats of taxation and deportation, Leopold put a stop to Sheppard's writing. Leopold subsequently demanded that missionaries direct all concerns to him and not to the press.\n\n==== E. V. Sj\u00f6blom ====\nSwedish Baptist missionary E. V. Sj\u00f6blom spoke of the atrocities to all who would listen.  In 1896 he published in the Swedish press a detailed article on the Congo's rubber industry, and this was reprinted elsewhere. He spoke about the brutality of the Force Publique at a public meeting attended by the press. Congo State officials counterattacked with newspaper articles, letters, and comments from Leopold in the Belgian and British press, and quickly silenced Sj\u00f6blom. The missionary never spoke up again.\n\n==== George Washington Williams ====\n[[File:George W. Williams from History of Negro Troops.jpg|thumb|alt George Washington Williams|[[George Washington Williams]]<br/>(October 16, 1849 \u2013 August 2, 1891)]]\n\nColonel [[George Washington Williams]] served in the Union army during the Civil War.

The newspaper folded and so did one in Cincinnati. He became a well-respected historian through his writings and lectures.\n\nIn 1889, Williams began writing for the European press syndicate. After an interview with Leopold, Williams went to the Congo to see \"[[Christian civilization]]\" in action. In early April 1891 Williams wrote a letter to Leopold entitled ''An Open Letter to His Serene Majesty Leopold II, King of the Belgians and Sovereign of the Independent State of Congo'' about the suffering of the region at the hands of Leopold's agents. The letter helped sway European and American public opinion against the Congo regime.<ref name=\"leos_ghost\">Hochschild, Adam, ''King Leopold's Ghost'', Pan Macmillan, London (1998). {{ISBN|0-330-49233-0}}.</ref> Williams' last pages accuse Leopold of a list of crimes, including manipulation of the general public. He voiced his disbelief: \"How thoroughly I have been disenchanted, disappointed, and disheartened.\"<ref>George Washington Williams, \"An Open Letter to His Serene Majesty Leopold II, King of the Belgians and Sovereign of the Independent State of the Congo\" repr., John Hope Franklin, ''George Washington Williams: A Biography''. [Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1985], 243\u2013254.</ref>\n\nHe then wrote ''A Report upon the Congo-State and Country to the President of the Republic of the United States of America'' describing how Leopold had manipulated the United States. By the time President [[Benjamin Harrison]] received his copy, the open letter had appeared in European and American newspapers. On 14 April 1891, ''The New York Times'' ran a front-page article on the full list of allegations.\n\n==== Leopold vs. Williams ====\nLeopold's Public Relations Minister employed newspaper editors to run articles about the good deeds of Leopold. Leopold himself gave interviews about his dreams and aspirations for the Congo and its future.\n\nOne day after the ''New York Times'' article, Leopold's supporters in America submitted an article that accused Williams of living a lie and committing adultery. The headline read \"HE PROSPERED FOR A TIME, BUT HIS TRUE CHARACTER WAS LEARNED.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1891/04/15/archives/williams-in-middletown-he-prospered-for-a-time-but-his-true.html |title=WILLIAMS IN MIDDLETOWN.; HE PROSPERED FOR A TIME, BUT HIS TRUE CHARACTER WAS LEARNED. |date=15 April 1891 |work=The New York Times}}</ref> During the late summer of 1891 the Belgian Parliament defended Leopold and gave a 45-page report to the press circuit, effectively refuting Williams's accusations. Williams died on August 2 with his reputation tarnished.\n\nThe missionaries who witnessed the atrocities had little media savvy or political clout. The public readily dismissed Leopold's critics from British humanitarian societies as relics of past battles like Abolitionism. And those critics, like the missionaries, became dismissed as people who were always upset about something in some obscure corner of the world.\n\n=== E. D. Morel ===\n[[File:1922_Edmund_Dene_Morel.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[E. D. Morel]]]]\n\nIn 1891, Morel became a clerk with [[Elder Dempster]], a Liverpool shipping firm.  In 1893, to increase his income and support his family, Morel began writing articles against French [[protectionism]], which was damaging Elder Dempster's business. Influenced by [[Mary Kingsley]], an English traveller and writer who showed sympathy for African peoples and respect for different cultures, he became critical of the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]] for not supporting African decolonisation movements.\n\nElder Dempster had a shipping contract with the [[Congo Free State]] for the run between [[Antwerp]] and [[Boma, Kongo Central|Boma]]. Groups such the [[Aborigines' Protection Society]] had already begun a campaign against atrocities in Congo. Due to his command of French, Morel was often sent to [[Belgium]], where he saw internal accounts of the Congo Free State held by Elder Dempster. Knowing that ships from Belgium to the Congo carried only guns, chains, ordnance, and explosives, but no commercial goods, while ships arriving from the colony came back full of valuable products such as raw [[rubber]] and [[ivory]], made him realise Congo Free State's exploitative nature.\n\n==== Newspapers ====\n''West African Mail'', the main media outlet for Morel, started as a small newspaper consisting of Morel's articles, letters from missionaries, maps, cartoons, and pictures; all \"to meet the rapidly growing interest in west and central African questions\".<ref>Hochschild, King Leopold's Ghost, 186</ref> [[John Holt (businessman)|John Holt]], a businessman and Morel's long time friend, helped fund the startup of the newspaper. Later other supporters invested.\n\nMorel wrote a five-part series entitled ''Trading Monopolies in West Africa''. He first wrote stories pertaining to free trade and native rights.\n\n<blockquote>Free Trade in West Africa, free trade for all; free trade for the Englishmen in a French colony, and in a German colony\u2026 There is plenty of room for the free, unfettered commerce of all the Powers of Europe of the Western Continent of Africa, and the greater(the natives), the attractions given to the trade in an individual colony\u2026 the more certain the contentment and the producing power of its inhabitants.<ref>E. D. Morel. \"Trading Monopolies in West Africa\". ''West African Mail''. [Liverpool 1903] (p. 35)</ref></blockquote>\n\nBut then he began to write about slavery, using adjectives like evil, bloody, vicious, horrific and violent:<ref>E. D. Morel. ''The West African Mail''. 1903</ref>\n\n* \"The rubber shipped home by the Congo companies\u2026 is stained with blood of hundreds of [[negro]]es.\"\n* \"This hideous structure of sordid [[wickedness]],\" he called it.\n* \"Blood is smeared all over the Congo State, its history is blood-stained, its deeds are bloody, the edifice it has reared is cemented in blood\u2014the blood of unfortunate negroes, spilled freely with the most sordid of all motives, monetary gain.\"<ref>E.D. Morel. Trading Monopolies. 9\u201310</ref>\n\nMorel also published in major British and Belgian papers. A book entitled ''Civilization in Congo-land'', by [[H.R. Fox Bourne]], secretary of the [[Aborigines Protection Society]], published in January 1903, reinforced Morel's argument. Various organizations passed resolutions demanding Government action. [[Sir Charles Dilke]] took many of these concerns to [[British Parliament|Parliament]] for discussion.\n\n==== Pamphlets ====\nIn 1903 Morel wrote his first pamphlet, ''The Congo Horrors'', which reached a larger general public than before. He emphasized the religious implications, free trade abuses, and accused Leopold. \"It has come to my conclusion that the murders and profiteering of the Congo are a result of neglect to civilize, and King Leopold is the proprietor.\"<ref>E.D. Morel. The Congo Horrors. [Liverpool: January 15, 1903.] (pg 5)</ref>  This pamphlet caught the eye of high British officials such as [[Sir Charles Dilke]] and [[Roger Casement]].\n\nMorel continued to write pieces such as ''The Scandal of the Congo, The Treatment of Women and Children of the Congo'' (published in America in the ''African Studies Journal''), and ''The New African Slavery'' (published in the International Union of London). They contained information and testimony from the missionaries of the brutality. The public began to pressure Parliament to do something about the atrocities.\n\nLater in 1903, Morel brought out a pamphlet of 112 pages entitled ''The Congo Slave State'', perhaps the strongest and fiercest indictment published. It contained a full and detailed description of Leopold's system in all the divisions of the Congo. It also had maps, reports from Parliament, and descriptions of atrocities. Sir Charles Dilke introduced copies of the pamphlet into Parliament. It caused considerable sensation, and resolutions passed against slavery in the Congo.\n\n==== Books ====\n[[File:Red rubber frontpage.jpg|thumb|left|Morel's expos\u00e9 ''Red Rubber''<ref>{{cite book|title=Red Rubber: The story of the rubber slave trade which flourished on the Congo for twenty years, 1890\u20131910|first=E.D.|last=Morel|authorlink= E.D. Morel |url=https://archive.org/details/redrubberstoryof00more}}</ref>]]\n\nBefore 1904, Morel released two books pertaining to [[West Africa]]. The first book, entitled ''Affairs of West Africa'',<ref>{{cite web|title=Affairs of West Africa|first=E. D. |last=Morel|authorlink= E.D. Morel|url=https://archive.org/details/affairsofwestafr00more}}</ref> discussed the history, inhabitants, flora and fauna, physical characteristics, industries, and trade and finances of the area; all from a man who'd never gone to West Africa. He got his information from traders and shipping crews during his days working for Elder Dempster, and from his missionary contacts. Morel concluded his book with attacks on Leopold and the Congo Free State administration. He contrasted the Congo Free State to the success of the French Congo, commemorating the French administration for their efforts within their West African colonies. He then asked for sympathy and understanding, from the English and French, on the issue of West Africa.\n\t\nNewspapers reviews were mixed. In ''The Daily Chronicle'' Sir Harry Johnston wrote:\n\n<blockquote>Mr. Morel's indictment is one of the most terrible things ever written, if true.<ref>Sir Harry Johnston. A Book Review. The Daily Chronicle. [1903]</ref></blockquote>\n\n''The Times'' also provided a glowing review of the book:\n\n<blockquote>It is with great satisfaction that the public will welcome a contribution to our general knowledge on the subject\u2026 The sufferings of which the picture was given to the world in [[Uncle Tom's Cabin]] are as nothing to those which Mr. Morel represents to be habitual accomplishments of the acquisition of rubber and ivory by the Belgian companies.<ref>The Times [1903]</ref></blockquote>\n\nPositive reviews helped create readership for his writings. A bad review from the ''Morning Post'' pertained to the comparison of the French Congo to Leopold's Congo Free State. Morel responded with another book, ''The British Case in the French Congo'', released three months later, in which he said he admired the French efforts, and again blamed the Congo Free State for the evil in West Africa. Even the ''Morning Post'' praised the second book. The public demanded government action. Thus on May 20, 1903 Parliament passed a resolution to allow the British Government to negotiate with the Powers over the matter. Parliament noted that \"great gratitude was due\" to Morel for creating public awareness.<ref>Cocks, ''The Story of the Congo Free State'', p. 96</ref>\n\nHis third book, ''King Leopold's Rule in Africa'',<ref>{{cite book|title=King Leopold's Rule in Africa |first=E. D. |last=Morel|authorlink= E.D. Morel|url= https://archive.org/details/kingleopoldsrule00moreuoft}}</ref> had photographs of mutilated women and children. Though he mostly let the pictures speak for themselves, he wrote effectively. \"Over and over again in his book did Morel hammer in the argument.\"<ref>Cocks, ''The Story of the Congo Free State'', p. 106</ref> Morel argued that the world must come together to fight for the end of the abuses.\n\n<blockquote>In the name of humanity, of common decency and pity, for honour's sake, if for no other cause, will not the Anglo-Saxon race \u2013 the Governments and the peoples of Great Britain and the United States, who between them are primarily responsible for the creation of the Congo State \u2013 make up their minds to handle this monstrous outrage resolutely, and so point the way, and set an example which others would then be compelled to follow? In that hope, with an ever present consciousness of inadequacy to portray the greatness of the evil and the greatness of responsibility, the author submits this volume to the public.<ref>E. D. Morel, ''King Leopold's Rule of Africa'', New York: Funk and Wagnalls Company, 1905, p. 101.</ref></blockquote>\n\nHis words and facts from the book appeared in book reviews all over Europe and the US. The reviewers described the horrific pictures and stories in full detail.\n\n==== Congo Reform Association ====\n[[File:Casement Roger.jpg|thumb|right|180px|right|[[Roger Casement]]]]\n\nAs Morel's writings stirred public feelings for the \"Congo Question\" within Great Britain, Parliament created an international commission to investigate. [[Roger Casement]], a British Consul to Africa and an acquaintance of Morel, went to the Congo and wrote a report for the British Government. Casement interviewed missionaries, natives, riverboat captains, and railroad workers and returned with a [[Casement Report|report]] of the most appalling events ever described.\n\nMany considered the report the most damning exposure ever of exploitation in Africa. A respected British Consul, chosen by the British Foreign Office, had written the thirty-nine pages of testimony and 23-page index of facts. The report produced a profound and widespread feeling in Britain that the administrative system of the Congo State must be reformed. The British Government commended Casement for his work and knighted him. Morel published the [[Casement Report]] in ''The West African Mail''. Newspapers around the world reported on the Casement Report.\n\nCasement and Morel met in Dublin to discuss the situation. Casement convinced Morel to form an organization to combat Leopold's abuses in the Congo. In November 1903, the [[Congo Reform Association]] (CRA) emerged. Casement put forward \u00a3100 as a start up fund. Morel went back to Liverpool to begin the new organization. He drew inspiration from Conrad's ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'', and called it \"the most powerful thing ever written on the subject\".<ref>Catherine Wynne, ''The Colonial Conan Doyle: British Imperialism, Irish Nationalism, and the Gothic'', London: Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002, p. 27.</ref> Casement deliberately absented himself from the launch of the Congo Reform Association at the Philharmonic Hall in Liverpool on March 23, 1904 because he did not want his celebrity to be the only reason people joined.\n\nThe founding manifesto began with an impressive list of names including the African businessman and entrepreneur [[John Holt (businessman)|John Holt]], the historian [[John Morley]], the Presbyterian Minister Reverend [[Reginald John Campbell|R. J. Campbell]] and the Quaker philanthropist [[William Adlington Barrow Cadbury|W. A. Cadbury]] of the Cadbury Chocolate Corp. Others included four bishops and a dozen influential peers of the realm.\n\nThe manifesto called for \"secure just and humane treatment of the inhabitants of the Congo State, and restoration of the rights to the land and of their individual freedom\".<ref>Roger Casement, ''The Casement Report'', p. 34.</ref> No more than a week later, the [[Massachusetts Commission for International Justice]] organized the American branch of the Congo Reform Association with members including [[Mark Twain]], [[Booker T. Washington]], and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]].\n\nIn September 1904, Morel arrived in New York for his American campaign, with a petition entitled ''The Memorial''.  The memorial contained signatures by all the members of the CRA. The purpose of the trip could be explained by Morel's own words during an interview for the ''New York Herald'' in 1903. When asked by the interviewer \"Why America?\" Morel answered:\n\n<blockquote>America has a peculiar and very clear responsibility in the matter, inasmuch as the American Government was the first to recognize the status of the International Association (later the Congo State), and thereby paved the way for similar action on the part of the European Powers\u2026 It is to be hoped that President Roosevelt and the American people may help undo the grieves wrong, which was thereby unknowingly inflicted upon the native inhabitants of the Congo territories.</blockquote>\n\nBefore Morel left for America he submitted a copy of the memorial to ''[[The New York Times]]'', the ''[[New York Post]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', and other press syndicates. The CRA and Morel hoped that before his arrival there would be strong public support from the American citizens. All the newspapers covered his arrival and displayed excerpts of the memorial. His articulate speeches throughout New England earned Morel an audience with President [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. The ''New York Post'' covered the visit with a full page, two-column article. Through the continuous newspaper coverage Americans became curious about Morel and the \"Congo Question\". On October 7 Morel spoke in Boston about the International Peace Congress. His speech was compelling and motivating, and helped focus American public attention on the Congo.\n\n<blockquote>The errand which has brought me to the United States is a very simple one. It is to appeal to you on behalf of the oppressed and persecuted peoples of the Congo, for whose present unhappy condition you, in America, and we, in England, have a great moral responsibility, from which we cannot escape and from which in honour we should not attempt to escape\u2026 It is my privilege to ask you who are met here in the cause of peace whether you will not lead a helping hand in staying the cruel and destructive wars \u2013 if the murder of helpless men and women can be dignified by such a name\u2026 In appealing to you on behalf of those millions of helpless Africans\u2026 It is a great responsibility that you have. If our duty is clear, surely yours is also clear. The African slave trade has been revived, and is in full swing in the Congo today. I ask you to help us to root it up and fling it out of Africa, and just as I have no doubt of the greatness and loftiness of your ideals, so I have no doubt of what your answer will be.<ref>''The Boston Globe'', 7 Oct 1904.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIt would take two more years for President Roosevelt and Congress to get involved. In a letter to [[Henry Cabot Lodge]], Roosevelt wrote: \"The only tomfoolery that anyone seems bent on is that about the Congo Free State outrages, and that is imbecile rather than noxious.\"<ref>Peter Diagn and L. H. Gann, ''The United States and Africa: A History'', Cambridge: University Press, 1987, p. 195.</ref> Overwhelmed by public pressure, Congress in 1906 took a stand against Leopold and demanded an end to the Congo Free State.\n\n=== Leopold's counter campaign ===\n{{Denial of mass killings}}\n[[File:An AnswerTwain.JPG|thumb|200px|Front cover of ''An Answer to Mark Twain'', anonymously published in Brussels (1907) in reply to ''King Leopold's Soliloquy''. Pictured are [[Mark Twain]] and [[E. D. Morel]].]]\nLeopold ordered{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} counterattacks refuting all the claims that Morel made. He had his propaganda machine write articles for major newspapers, including the ''[[New York Times]]'', as well as numerous letters to the editor.\n\nDiscrediting Morel and the CRA had not worked. Leopold commissioned an internal investigation of the Congo to prove to the public that he cared.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} A committee of Congo officials issued reports that denied any atrocities. Morel collected letters, photos, and testimony from the Congolese, for an extensive media blitz of [[pamphlets]], [[newspaper]] articles, letters and books.\n\nLeopold's response included articles countering the claims, but he also sent agents to spy on Morel during his American visit. [[Mark Twain]] released '' [[King Leopold's Soliloquy]] '', which talked about the abuses and Leopold's denial. Twain wrote it from the perspective of Leopold. \"They burst out and call me 'the king with ten million murders on his soul{{'\"}}<ref>Mark Twain, ''King Leopold's Soliloquy: A Defense of His Congo Rule'', New York: P.R. Warren, 1905, p. 2.</ref>  Throughout the book, Twain portrays Leopold as guilty and evil. \"Well...no matter, I did beat the Yankees, anyway! There is comfort in that. [Reads with a mocking smile, the President's Order of Recognition of April 22, 1884]\". Twain's account presents the image of a disingenuous Leopold plotting and scheming to keep the truth from coming out.\n\nLeopold's agents countered with letters to the editor and a book entitled ''An Answer to Mark Twain''. In the book they call Twain and Morel liars and manipulators. \"Truth shines forth in the following pages, which summarily show what the Congo Free State is.\" \"All the Mr. Twain and Morel have said. Lies!\"<ref>Anonymous, ''An Answer to Mark Twain'', New York: A&G Bulens Brothers, 1906, p. 2.</ref> One of Leopold's hired lobbyists, [[Henry I. Kowalsky]] caused a sensation in December 1906 by making public all the communications between himself, Leopold, and the Congo State.<ref name=\"leos_ghost\"/>\n\nLeopold finally appointed a commission of inquiry, to investigate specific charges of the atrocities and reported abuses. The commission included members of the Belgian Parliament and lower officials in the government.\n\n==== The downfall ====\nLeopold released press statements about the commission hoping to quell the public uproar. However, Leopold wanted a private, not a published, report.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} The commission returned with the most evidence of abuse yet \u2013 interviews with over a hundred natives and numerous missionaries, documents from the Force Publique detailing deaths and mutilations inflicted, and documents from the Congo State administration proving that Leopold profited more than he reported.\n\nThe CRA obtained the report, and published it in ''The West African Mail'', ''The New York Times'', the Associated Press, and European press agencies. The report, ''Evidence Laid Before the Congo Commission of Inquiry'', also became a pamphlet distributed by the CRA throughout Europe and the United States. Appointed by Leopold himself, the commission reported horrific testimony, facts on deaths and mutilations, and letters obtained from the Congo Administration documenting the abuses. Leopold could not refute his own commission's findings. Leopold yielded the Congo Free State to Belgium in exchange for a financial settlement in 1908.  He died, aged 74, the following year and was never judged.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Political warfare]]\n* [[Public diplomacy]]\n* [[Public relations]]\n\n== References ==\n<!--- See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes on how to create references using  tags which will then appear here automatically -->\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n=== Primary ===\n* Anonymous.

{"title_page": "Official bilingualism in the public service of Canada", "text_new": "Because [[Canada]] has, for over two centuries, contained both English- and French-speakers, the question of the language used in the administration of public affairs has always been a sensitive issue.\n\nAmong the aspect of this issue that have excited public attention from time to time are: \n*the perception of fairness or unfairness in hiring and promoting speakers of one official language over speakers of the other;\n*the choice of one language over the other for meetings, documents, and internal memoranda (which are sometimes collectively characterized as the work \u201cenvironment\u201d);\n*the promotion of bilingual job candidates over people who only speak only one or the other of the two official languages;\n*the availability (or lack of availability) of language training for public servants, who cannot advance without the ability to speak both languages;\n*the costs associated with language-based hiring and promotion practices, including the practice of paying a \u201cbilingual bonus\u201d to public servants capable of speaking both official languages;\n*the need to provide government services to some Canadians in English, and to others in French.\n\n==Ratio of native English-speakers to native French-speakers==\n\nThe issue of proportional hiring and promotion of speakers of both official languages has been an issue in Canadian politics since before Confederation. Members of each linguistic group have, at different times in the country's history, complained of injustice when their group have been represented, in public service hiring and promotion, in numbers less than would be justified by their proportion of the national population.\n\nFor the greater part of Canada's history, French-speakers were underrepresented, and English-speakers were overrepresented in the ranks of the public service. This disproportion became more pronounced in the more senior ranks of the Public Service. However, this trend has reversed itself in recent decades. Today, French is the first official language of 23% of Canada's population,<ref>Statistics Canada Census 2011 data. \"http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/as-sa/98-314-x/2011003/tbl/tbl3_1-1-eng.cfm\"</ref> with 29.2% of Public Service of Canada employees identifying French as their first official language,<ref>Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat Annual Report on Official Languages 2010-2011. \"http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/res/stats/demo11-eng.asp#toc01.2.c\"</ref> including 32% of management-level jobs.<ref>Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat Annual Report on Official Languages 2010-2011. \"http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/reports-rapports/ol-lo/10-11/arol-ralo/arol-ralo06-eng.asp#toc5.0\"</ref>\n\nThe first high-profile complaint of preferential hiring took place in 1834. One of the [[Ninety-Two Resolutions]] of the [[Lower Canada|Lower Canadian]] House of Assembly drew attention to the fact that French Canadians, who at the time were 88% of the colony's population, held only 30% of the posts in the 157-member colonial civil service. Moreover, the resolution stated, French Canadians were, \"for the most part, appointed to the inferior and less lucrative offices, and most frequently only obtaining even them, by becoming the dependent of those [British immigrants] who hold the higher and the more lucrative offices....\"<ref>'''Resolution 75.''' ''Resolved, That the number of the Inhabitants of the country being about 600,000, those of French origin are about 525,000, and those of British or other origin 75,000; and that the establishment of the civil government of Lower Canada, for the year 1832, accordingly to the yearly returns made by the Provincial Administration, for the information of the British Parliament, contained the names of 157 officers and others receiving salaries, who are apparently of British or foreign origin and the names of 47 who are, apparently, natives of the country, of French origin; that this statement does not exhibit the whole disproportion which exists in the distribution of the public money and power, the latter class being, for the most part, appointed to the inferior and less lucrative offices, and most frequently only obtaining even them, by becoming the dependent of those who hold the higher and the more lucrative offices; that the accumulation of many of the best paid and most influential, and at the same time incompatible, offices in the same person, which is forbidden by the laws and by sound policy, exists especially for the benefit of the former class; and that two-thirds of the persons included in the last commission of the peace issued in the province, are apparently of British or foreign origin, and one-third only of French origin.''</ref>\n\nWith the advent of [[responsible government]] in the 1840s, the power to make civil service appointments was transferred to elected politicians, who had a strong incentive to ensure that French Canadian voters did not feel that they were being frozen out of hiring and promotions. Although no formal reform of the hiring and promotion process was ever undertaken, the patronage-driven hiring process seems to have produced a more equitable representation of the two language groups. In 1863, the public service of the united [[Province of Canada]] (which included both of the former colonies of [[Lower Canada]] and [[Upper Canada]]) had grown to include 450 officials at its administrative headquarters. Of these, 161 persons, or about 36%, were French Canadians. However, French-speaking civil servants accounted for only 20% of the total payroll, suggesting that they were mainly confined to the lower ranks of the colonial administration.<ref>J.E. Hodgetts ''Pioneer Public Service: An Administrative History of the United Canadas, 1841-1867.'' Toronto: Canadian Government Series, no. 7, 1955, p. 57.</ref>\n\nIn the period between 1867 and the turn of the Twentieth Century, French-Canadians made up about one-third of the Canadian population, and seem also to have represented about one-third of civil service appointments at junior levels, although they had only about half that much representation at most senior level.<ref>[[Eugene Forsey]] writes: \u201cIn the Dominion Civil Service, C\u00f4t\u00e9\u2019s ''Political Appointments'', 1867-1895, shows that, over that period, eliminating duplications, the French Canadians had rather over a third of the official of the House and of the two Dominion Courts; rather less than a third of other officials of the rank of Deputy Minister and, of the officials from Chief Clerk up to Deputy Minister rather less than one-seventh.\u201d\nSource\u2014Eugene Forsey, ''Freedom and Order: Collected Essays.'' Ottawa: Carleton University Press, 1974, p. 243.</ref>  In general, it seems to have been the case that throughout the entire period between Confederation and the introduction of merit-based hiring and promotion in 1919, the percentage of French-speakers in the civil service relatively closely matched their percentage of the Canadian population because French-Canadians occupied a more-or-less proportionate share of cabinet posts, and they appointed public servants who were personally loyal to them. This so-called \"[[spoils system]]\" ensured a rough equity between members of the two language groups. A quarter-century after this system had been abolished, it was summarized as follows in a submission to the 1946 [[Royal Commission on Administrative Classifications in the Civil Service]]:\n\n{{cquote|Before 1919, positions in the bureaucracy were distributed, in large measure, under a patronage system (spoils system) even though some efforts at reform had been put in place and had introduced a degree of permanence in head offices. French-speaking statesmen, just like their [English-speaking] colleagues, were therefore able to obtain their share of the patronage. General administration was not very complicated in those days and ministers could personally take charge of administering the internal organization of their respective departments, as it was possible to personally know every one of their employees.<ref>Chambre de Commerce du District de Montr\u00e9al, ''M\u00e9moire soumis \u00e0 la Commission Royale d'Enqu\u00eate sur le Service Civil F\u00e9d\u00e9ral''. April, 1946, p. 14. The original passage is in French, but the words \"spoils system\" are in English in the original.</ref>}}\n\nIn 1918, just before the reforms began, the percentage of francophones in the [[Public Service of Canada|federal civil service]] stood at just under 22%. The drop in the percentage of French-speakers was in part due to the fact that the proportion of Canadians who were French-speaking was gradually declining; in the 1921 census, persons of French origin were down to 27.9% of the population.<ref>See Richard Joy, ''Canada's Official Languages: The Progress of Bilingualism''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1992, p. 121 (Table 20).</ref> As well, the [[Unionist Party (Canada)|Unionist]] government then in power had almost no representation in Quebec, which meant that for several years there were no French-Canadian ministers appointing and promoting their fellow French-speakers.\n\nThe percentage of French-speakers would, however, drop much further as a result of the replacement of a patronage-based appointment system with a merit-based system that was largely based upon the ability to perform efficiently in English. By 1946, according to figures presented in the House of Commons, native speakers of French had declined to only 13% of public service posts.<ref>Canada, House of Commons Debates, 1946, 2nd Session, IV, 3520.</ref>  At the time, French-speakers represented slightly under 30% of the Canadian population.<ref>In the 1941 census, French was the mother tongue of 29.2% of Canada's population. See Richard Joy, ''Canada's Official Languages: The Progress of Bilingualism''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1992, p. 120 (Table 19).</ref> This seems to have represented the low point, in terms of inequitably low representation for Francophones within the Public Service; by 1964, French-speakers had risen to 21.5% of the Public Service (which itself had grown to 137,000 officials, meaning that 29,500 French-speakers were employed by the federal government).<ref>Canada, ''Report of the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism\u2019', vol. III, ''The Work World'' (Ottawa, 1969), Table 49, p. 210.</ref> Although this represented a substantial improvement, French-speakers at this time represented about 28% of Canada's population, and therefore continued to be underrepresented. Moreover, French-Canadians continued to be grouped at the bottom of the seniority scale: They represented 23.7% of junior employees earning less than $4,000 per year, but only 10.4% of senior officials with earnings in the highest category (over $15,000).<ref>Canada, ''Report of the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism'', vol. III, ''The Work World'' (Ottawa, 1969), Figure 9, p. 212.</ref>\n\nBy the early 1960s, the issue of Canada's seemingly perpetual inability to create an equitable distribution of jobs in the country's rapidly expanding public service was becoming a key grievance underlying [[Quebec nationalism]].  In 1961, a [[Glasscoe Commission|Royal Commission studying the structure of the federal bureaucracy]] organized a special committee to study the issue of bilingualism within the Public Service. The Commission's 1962 report included recommendations that the federal government \u201cadopt active measures to develop bilingual capacities among its employees on a selective basis,\u201d and that it more actively recruit qualified French Canadians who would have the potential to advance to the senior ranks of the federal administration.<ref>Canada, ''Report of the Royal Commission on Government Organization'', vol. I (Ottawa, 1962), p. 267.</ref>\n\nIn part on the basis of this recommendation, the government of Prime Minister [[Lester B. Pearson]] established a [[Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism]], which made language reform within the public service one of its highest priorities.  Book III of the Royal Commission's multi-volume report, published in 1969, recommended a radical redesign of the Public Service of Canada, in order to establish full equality between the two official languages in the federal administration, and a permanently equitable distribution of jobs, at all levels of seniority, between French-speaking and English-speaking Canadians.<ref>Canada, ''Report of the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism'', vol. III, ''The Work World'' (Ottawa, 1969).</ref>\n\n===Recent increase in ratio of native French-speakers===\nSince the report of the Royal Commission in 1969, the percentage of Francophones in the public service of Canada has increased, and the percentage of Anglophones has decreased.  Both Francophones and Anglophones are overrepresented in the public service due to the number of Canadians who speak neither English nor French.\n\nWhen looking at public service positions in various regions of the country, the same trend has occurred; however it is much less pronounced outside of the national capital region surrounding Ottawa, Ontario and Gatineau, Quebec.\n\n{{gallery\n|

capacity of the candidate for the position: bilingual imperative, English essential, French essential or either French or English essential. The bilingual imperative category is further broken down into the level of both languages the candidate is required to speak.  Since 1989 there has been a sharp increase in the number of positions classified as \u2018bilingual imperative\u2019 and a sharp decrease in the number of positions open to unilingual Canadians.\n\n[[File:Job classifications in the public service of Canada.JPG|thumb|left|400px|''Job classifications in the public service of Canada''<ref name=\"Rep by category\"/><ref name=\"home language\"/>]]\n\n==Current situation==\nToday, the built-in barriers to the hiring and promotion of francophones have been overcome. French-speakers ceased to be underrepresented in the Public Service in 1978, and the percentage of public servants who are francophones has been growing steadily ever since. At the management level, French-speakers ceased to be under-represented in 1995. There is now a growing over-representation of persons with French as their first official language in the Public Service. In 2007, francophones occupied 31.5% of positions in the core public administration, and 26.9% in institutions subject to the ''Official Languages Act'', overall.<ref name=2006Report/> Bilingualism is desirable for politicians; [[John Turner]]'s fluency in both English and French, for example, helped him become [[leader of the Liberal Party of Canada|leader of the Liberal Party]] and Prime Minister in 1984.<ref name=\"martin19840618\">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/18/world/man-in-the-news-new-leader-for-canada-john-napier-turner.html | title=New Leader for Canada: John Napier Turner | work=The New York Times | date=1984-06-18 | accessdate=11 September 2015 | author=Martin, Douglas}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, positions in the core public administration broke down as follows:\n\n\"Bilingual\" - 40.2%\n\"English Essential\" - 51.2%\n\"French Essential\" - 4.0%\n\"English or French Essential\" - 4.4%<ref name=2006Report>{{cite web|title=Annual Report on Official Languages 2006-2007|url=http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/rp/0607ol05-eng.asp|publisher=Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat|date=2009-02-10}}{{Dead link|date=May 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn his 2008-09 annual report, the Commissioner for Official Languages wrote, \"A vast majority of federal institutions have yet to create a workplace where their employees feel comfortable using either official language and are encouraged to do so.\" He identified the following problem areas:\n\n* \"French is not used as much as it should be as a language of work in federal offices located in the National Capital Region and outside Quebec.\"\n* \"French does not have its rightful place in communications between the federal government\u2019s head offices and its regional offices in Quebec.\"\n* \"English remains underused as a language of work in the Quebec offices of federal institutions.\"<ref name=\"2008Report-chap2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ocol-clo.gc.ca/html/ar_ra_2008_09_p7_e.php|title=Chapter 2: Vision, Leadership and Commitment: Fundamentals of the Full Implementation of the Act|date=2009-05-25|work=Annual Report 2008-2009 |publisher=Office of the Commissioner of Official Languages}}</ref>\n\nA lack of language proficiency on the part of some managers may contribute to the situation.

Members of each linguistic group have, at different times in the country's history, complained of injustice when their group have been represented, in public service hiring and promotion, in numbers less than would be justified by their proportion of the national population.\n\nFor the greater part of Canada's history, French-speakers were underrepresented, and English-speakers were overrepresented in the ranks of the public service. This disproportion became more pronounced in the more senior ranks of the Public Service. However, this trend has reversed itself in recent decades. Today, French is the first official language of 23% of Canada's population,<ref>Statistics Canada Census 2011 data. \"http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/as-sa/98-314-x/2011003/tbl/tbl3_1-1-eng.cfm\"</ref> with 29.2% of Public Service of Canada employees identifying French as their first official language,<ref>Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat Annual Report on Official Languages 2010-2011. \"http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/res/stats/demo11-eng.asp#toc01.2.c\"</ref> including 32% of management-level jobs.<ref>Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat Annual Report on Official Languages 2010-2011. \"http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/reports-rapports/ol-lo/10-11/arol-ralo/arol-ralo06-eng.asp#toc5.0\"</ref>\n\nThe first high-profile complaint of preferential hiring took place in 1834. One of the [[Ninety-Two Resolutions]] of the [[Lower Canada|Lower Canadian]] House of Assembly drew attention to the fact that French Canadians, who at the time were 88% of the colony's population, held only 30% of the posts in the 157-member colonial civil service. Moreover, the resolution stated, French Canadians were, \"for the most part, appointed to the inferior and less lucrative offices, and most frequently only obtaining even them, by becoming the dependent of those [British immigrants] who hold the higher and the more lucrative offices....\"<ref>'''Resolution 75.''' ''Resolved, That the number of the Inhabitants of the country being about 600,000, those of French origin are about 525,000, and those of British or other origin 75,000; and that the establishment of the civil government of Lower Canada, for the year 1832, accordingly to the yearly returns made by the Provincial Administration, for the information of the British Parliament, contained the names of 157 officers and others receiving salaries, who are apparently of British or foreign origin and the names of 47 who are, apparently, natives of the country, of French origin; that this statement does not exhibit the whole disproportion which exists in the distribution of the public money and power, the latter class being, for the most part, appointed to the inferior and less lucrative offices, and most frequently only obtaining even them, by becoming the dependent of those who hold the higher and the more lucrative offices; that the accumulation of many of the best paid and most influential, and at the same time incompatible, offices in the same person, which is forbidden by the laws and by sound policy, exists especially for the benefit of the former class; and that two-thirds of the persons included in the last commission of the peace issued in the province, are apparently of British or foreign origin, and one-third only of French origin.''</ref>\n\nWith the advent of [[responsible government]] in the 1840s, the power to make civil service appointments was transferred to elected politicians, who had a strong incentive to ensure that French Canadian voters did not feel that they were being frozen out of hiring and promotions. Although no formal reform of the hiring and promotion process was ever undertaken, the patronage-driven hiring process seems to have produced a more equitable representation of the two language groups. In 1863, the public service of the united [[Province of Canada]] (which included both of the former colonies of [[Lower Canada]] and [[Upper Canada]]) had grown to include 450 officials at its administrative headquarters. Of these, 161 persons, or about 36%, were French Canadians. However, French-speaking civil servants accounted for only 20% of the total payroll, suggesting that they were mainly confined to the lower ranks of the colonial administration.<ref>J.E. Hodgetts ''Pioneer Public Service: An Administrative History of the United Canadas, 1841-1867.'' Toronto: Canadian Government Series, no. 7, 1955, p. 57.</ref>\n\nIn the period between 1867 and the turn of the Twentieth Century, French-Canadians made up about one-third of the Canadian population, and seem also to have represented about one-third of civil service appointments at junior levels, although they had only about half that much representation at most senior level.<ref>[[Eugene Forsey]] writes: \u201cIn the Dominion Civil Service, C\u00f4t\u00e9\u2019s ''Political Appointments'', 1867-1895, shows that, over that period, eliminating duplications, the French Canadians had rather over a third of the official of the House and of the two Dominion Courts; rather less than a third of other officials of the rank of Deputy Minister and, of the officials from Chief Clerk up to Deputy Minister rather less than one-seventh.\u201d\nSource\u2014Eugene Forsey, ''Freedom and Order: Collected Essays.'' Ottawa: Carleton University Press, 1974, p. 243.</ref>  In general, it seems to have been the case that throughout the entire period between Confederation and the introduction of merit-based hiring and promotion in 1919, the percentage of French-speakers in the civil service relatively closely matched their percentage of the Canadian population because French-Canadians occupied a more-or-less proportionate share of cabinet posts, and they appointed public servants who were personally loyal to them. This so-called \"[[spoils system]]\" ensured a rough equity between members of the two language groups. A quarter-century after this system had been abolished, it was summarized as follows in a submission to the 1946 [[Royal Commission on Administrative Classifications in the Civil Service]]:\n\n{{cquote|Before 1919, positions in the bureaucracy were distributed, in large measure, under a patronage system (spoils system) even though some efforts at reform had been put in place and had introduced a degree of permanence in head offices. French-speaking statesmen, just like their [English-speaking] colleagues, were therefore able to obtain their share of the patronage. General administration was not very complicated in those days and ministers could personally take charge of administering the internal organization of their respective departments, as it was possible to personally know every one of their employees.<ref>Chambre de Commerce du District de Montr\u00e9al, ''M\u00e9moire soumis \u00e0 la Commission Royale d'Enqu\u00eate sur le Service Civil F\u00e9d\u00e9ral''. April, 1946, p. 14. The original passage is in French, but the words \"spoils system\" are in English in the original.</ref>}}\n\nIn 1918, just before the reforms began, the percentage of francophones in the [[Public Service of Canada|federal civil service]] stood at just under 22%. The drop in the percentage of French-speakers was in part due to the fact that the proportion of Canadians who were French-speaking was gradually declining; in the 1921 census, persons of French origin were down to 27.9% of the population.<ref>See Richard Joy, ''Canada's Official Languages: The Progress of Bilingualism''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1992, p. 121 (Table 20).</ref> As well, the [[Unionist Party (Canada)|Unionist]] government then in power had almost no representation in Quebec, which meant that for several years there were no French-Canadian ministers appointing and promoting their fellow French-speakers.\n\nThe percentage of French-speakers would, however, drop much further as a result of the replacement of a patronage-based appointment system with a merit-based system that was largely based upon the ability to perform efficiently in English. By 1946, according to figures presented in the House of Commons, native speakers of French had declined to only 13% of public service posts.<ref>Canada, House of Commons Debates, 1946, 2nd Session, IV, 3520.</ref>  At the time, French-speakers represented slightly under 30% of the Canadian population.<ref>In the 1941 census, French was the mother tongue of 29.2% of Canada's population. See Richard Joy, ''Canada's Official Languages: The Progress of Bilingualism''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1992, p. 120 (Table 19).</ref> This seems to have represented the low point, in terms of inequitably low representation for Francophones within the Public Service; by 1964, French-speakers had risen to 21.5% of the Public Service (which itself had grown to 137,000 officials, meaning that 29,500 French-speakers were employed by the federal government).<ref>Canada, ''Report of the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism\u2019', vol. III, ''The Work World'' (Ottawa, 1969), Table 49, p. 210.</ref> Although this represented a substantial improvement, French-speakers at this time represented about 28% of Canada's population, and therefore continued to be underrepresented. Moreover, French-Canadians continued to be grouped at the bottom of the seniority scale: They represented 23.7% of junior employees earning less than $4,000 per year, but only 10.4% of senior officials with earnings in the highest category (over $15,000).<ref>Canada, ''Report of the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism'', vol. III, ''The Work World'' (Ottawa, 1969), Figure 9, p. 212.</ref>\n\nBy the early 1960s, the issue of Canada's seemingly perpetual inability to create an equitable distribution of jobs in the country's rapidly expanding public service was becoming a key grievance underlying [[Quebec nationalism]].  In 1961, a [[Glasscoe Commission|Royal Commission studying the structure of the federal bureaucracy]] organized a special committee to study the issue of bilingualism within the Public Service. The Commission's 1962 report included recommendations that the federal government \u201cadopt active measures to develop bilingual capacities among its employees on a selective basis,\u201d and that it more actively recruit qualified French Canadians who would have the potential to advance to the senior ranks of the federal administration.<ref>Canada, ''Report of the Royal Commission on Government Organization'', vol. I (Ottawa, 1962), p. 267.</ref>\n\nIn part on the basis of this recommendation, the government of Prime Minister [[Lester B. Pearson]] established a [[Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism]], which made language reform within the public service one of its highest priorities.  Book III of the Royal Commission's multi-volume report, published in 1969, recommended a radical redesign of the Public Service of Canada, in order to establish full equality between the two official languages in the federal administration, and a permanently equitable distribution of jobs, at all levels of seniority, between French-speaking and English-speaking Canadians.<ref>Canada, ''Report of the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism'', vol. III, ''The Work World'' (Ottawa, 1969).</ref>\n\n===Recent increase in ratio of native French-speakers===\nSince the report of the Royal Commission in 1969, the percentage of Francophones in the public service of Canada has increased, and the percentage of Anglophones has decreased.  Both Francophones and Anglophones are overrepresented in the public service due to the number of Canadians who speak neither English nor French.\n\nWhen looking at public service positions in various regions of the country, the same trend has occurred; however it is much less pronounced outside of the national capital region surrounding Ottawa, Ontario and Gatineau, Quebec.\n\n{{gallery\n|
