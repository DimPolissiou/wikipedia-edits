It was directed by Robert Fuest with a [[screenplay]] by [[David Wiltse]] and starring [[Sharon Gless]], [[Julie Kavner]], [[Don Johnson]], [[Arthur Hill (actor)|Arthur Hill]], and [[Audra Lindley]]. It is the first in a series of sequels inspired by the 1972 novel and the original 1975 film ''[[The Stepford Wives (1975 film)|The Stepford Wives]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nSet 10 years after the original film, a prologue sets the scene as a couple unhappy in idyllic Stepford, Connecticut, attempts to leave town; they are killed by the police chief.\n\nSpirited investigative TV [[reporter]] Kaye Foster (Gless) arrives in Stepford to do a story on the American town with the lowest crime and [[divorce]] rates and the tightest real-estate market in the country.  She immediately notices the beautiful, but compliant and domestic women of the town, who take a pill four times a day when an eerie [[siren (noisemaker)|siren]] sounds (they each claim it is for a thyroid condition). Kaye meets Megan and Andy Brady (Kavner and Johnson), newcomers to town. Megan is refreshingly down to earth, and Andy is interviewing to join the [[police]] force and become a member of the Stepford Men's Association, headed by refined but vaguely hostile Dale \"Diz\" Coba (Hill). Kaye needs a research assistant, and after being turned off by the seemingly plastic and subservient women of Stepford, she jumps at the chance to hire Megan.\n\nKaye is shaken when Barbara Parkinson (Lindley) \"accidentally\" nearly runs her down with her car, then exhibits strange, repetitive behavior at the accident site, yet has no recollection of the incident the next day. Disillusioned hotel manager Wally (Adams) seems guiltily on the verge of divulging something important to Kaye about his wife's inability to change, when another attempt is made on Kaye's life.\n\nAndy assumes the job with the Stepford Police and Megan has chosen a house when she is sent to the Men's Association and disappears for a few days. Suspicious, Kaye sneaks into a [[garden party]] at the Association attended by the townswomen; there, three new \"sisters\" are welcomed, including Megan. All three wear the frilly and outdated fashions that are so popular in town and exhibit the brainless behavior of the other wives. Kaye overhears Diz explaining to the husbands that the wives have been [[Brainwashing|brainwashed]] and kept compliant by the \"thyroid pills\". To keep them subservient, they must not drink [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]], miss the medication, or be overstimulated, or the women will become hostile and potentially [[violent]]. Kaye is discovered and narrowly escapes, and the men set out to track her down.\n\nKaye shows up at Megan's house, throws out her pills and compels her to down some [[vodka]]. At first, Megan attempts to stab Kaye and [[Mania|manically]] clean the house. Overcome, she later recovers and the two women knock out Andy. Kaye, now disguised as a Stepford wife, enlists the aide of Wally to help them escape; he betrays them, but having anticipated this, Kaye manages to elude him. However, their plan to escape by [[train]] fails, and Megan is taken to the Men's Association for reconditioning. Eventually, Kaye arrives and holds Diz at [[gun]]point while Megan repeatedly sounds the pill siren. All the women of the town overdose on their pills, becoming disoriented and then violent.  Having second thoughts about the scheme, Andy shows up in time to reconcile and escape with Megan. Kaye is finally caught by Diz, however, and just as he is about to kill her, he is confronted by the vengeful women of the town. Screaming and clawing, they push him over a balcony, trample him, and literally tear him apart. Shocked and horrified, Kaye makes her escape.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sharon Gless]] as Kaye Foster\n* [[Julie Kavner]] as Megan Brady\n* [[Audra Lindley]] as Barbara Parkinson\n* [[Don Johnson]] as Officer Andy Brady\n* [[Mason Adams]] as Wally\n* [[Arthur Hill (actor)|Arthur Hill]] as Gale 'Diz' Corbett\n* [[Gay Rowan]] as Angeline\n* [[Howard Witt]] as Police Chief\n* [[Peter Maloney (actor)|Peter Maloney]] as Henry the druggist\n\n==Production==\nThe film first aired on October 12, 1980.

It is the first in a series of sequels inspired by the 1972 novel and the original 1975 film ''[[The Stepford Wives (1975 film)|The Stepford Wives]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nSet 10 years after the original film, a prologue sets the scene as a couple unhappy in idyllic Stepford, Connecticut, attempts to leave town; they are killed by the police chief.\n\nSpirited investigative TV [[reporter]] Kaye Foster (Gless) arrives in Stepford to do a story on the American town with the lowest crime and [[divorce]] rates and the tightest real-estate market in the country.  She immediately notices the beautiful, but compliant and domestic women of the town, who take a pill four times a day when an eerie [[siren (noisemaker)|siren]] sounds (they each claim it is for a thyroid condition). Kaye meets Megan and Andy Brady (Kavner and Johnson), newcomers to town. Megan is refreshingly down to earth, and Andy is interviewing to join the [[police]] force and become a member of the Stepford Men's Association, headed by refined but vaguely hostile Dale \"Diz\" Coba (Hill).
