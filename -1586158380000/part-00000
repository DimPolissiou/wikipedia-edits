Note that a particular group may warrant listing under more than one region, either because the group is distributed in more than one region (example: [[Inuit]] in North America and eastern Russia), or there may be some overlap of the regions themselves (that is, the boundaries of each region are not always clear, and some locations may commonly be associated with more than one region).\n\n== Definition ==\n{{Main|Indigenous peoples#Definitions}}\n\nIndigenous communities, peoples and nations are those which, having a historical continuity with pre-invasion and pre-colonial societies that developed on their territories, consider themselves distinct from other sectors of the societies now prevailing on those territories, or parts of them. They form at present non-dominant sectors of society and are determined to preserve, develop and transmit to future generations their ancestral territories, and their ethnic identity, as the basis of their continued existence as coples, in accordance with their own cultural patterns, social institutions and legal system.<ref>Jose R. Martinez Cobo</ref>\n\nThis historical continuity may consist of the continuation, for an extended period reaching into the present of one or more of the following factors:\n\n* Occupation of ancestral lands, or at least of part of them\n* Common ancestry with the original occupants of these lands\n* Culture in general, or in specific manifestations (such as religion, living under a tribal system, membership of an indigenous community, dress, means of livelihood, lifestyle, etc.)\n* Language (whether used as the only language, as mother-tongue, as the habitual means of communication at home or in the family, or as the main, preferred, habitual, general or normal language)\n* Residence in certain parts of the country, or in certain regions of the world\n* Other relevant factors.\n* On an individual basis, an indigenous person is one who belongs to these indigenous populations through self-identification as indigenous (group consciousness) and is recognized and accepted by these populations as one of its members (acceptance by the group). This preserves for these communities the sovereign right and power to decide who belongs to them, without external interference.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110809174257/http://www.indigenouspeoples.nl/indigenous-peoples/definition-indigenous Definition of indigenous peoples]</ref>\n\n== Afro-Eurasia

Note that a particular group may warrant listing under more than one region, either because the group is distributed in more than one region (example: [[Inuit]] in North America and eastern Russia), or there may be some overlap of the regions themselves (that is, the boundaries of each region are not always clear, and some locations may commonly be associated with more than one region).\n\n== Definition ==\n{{Main|Indigenous peoples#Definitions}}\n\nIndigenous communities, peoples and nations are those which, having a historical continuity with pre-invasion and pre-colonial societies that developed on their territories, consider themselves distinct from other sectors of the societies now prevailing on those territories, or parts of them. They form at present non-dominant sectors of society and are determined to preserve, develop and transmit to future generations their ancestral territories, and their ethnic identity, as the basis of their continued existence as coples, in accordance with their own cultural patterns, social institutions and legal system.<ref>Jose R. Martinez Cobo</ref>\n\nThis historical continuity may consist of the continuation, for an extended period reaching into the present of one or more of the following factors:\n\n* Occupation of ancestral lands, or at least of part of them\n* Common ancestry with the original occupants of these lands\n* Culture in general, or in specific manifestations (such as religion, living under a tribal system, membership of an indigenous community, dress, means of livelihood, lifestyle, etc.)\n* Language (whether used as the only language, as mother-tongue, as the habitual means of communication at home or in the family, or as the main, preferred, habitual, general or normal language)\n* Residence in certain parts of the country, or in certain regions of the world\n* Other relevant factors.\n* On an individual basis, an indigenous person is one who belongs to these indigenous populations through self-identification as indigenous (group consciousness) and is recognized and accepted by these populations as one of its members (acceptance by the group). This preserves for these communities the sovereign right and power to decide who belongs to them, without external interference.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110809174257/http://www.indigenouspeoples.nl/indigenous-peoples/definition-indigenous Definition of indigenous peoples]</ref>\n\n== Afro-Eurasia

It was recorded at [[Britannia Row Studios]] in London and released on 13 May 1985.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Gale |first=Lee |date=2012-03-29 |title= GQ&A: BERNARD SUMNER|url=http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/bernard-sumner-interview-2012-new-order|magazine= |location=New York City|publisher=Cond\u00e9 Nast |access-date=2017-01-31}}</ref> It is the first New Order song to be included on a [[studio album]], ''[[Low-Life]]'', at the same time as its release as a single. The vinyl version has Factory catalogue number FAC 123 and the video has the opposite number, FAC 321.\n\n==Background==\nWhile widely regarded as a centrepiece of New Order's catalogue, \"The Perfect Kiss\" reached only number 46 in the UK charts. \n\nThe song's themes include love \"We believe in a land of love\" and death \"the perfect kiss is the kiss of death\".<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Lariviere |first=Aaron |date=2013-01-25 |title=The 10 Best New Order Songs|url=http://www.stereogum.com/1244332/the-10-best-new-order-songs/top-stories/|magazine= |location=New York City|publisher=Billboard-Hollywood Reporter Media Group |access-date=2017-01-31}}</ref> The overall meaning of the song is unclear to its writer today. In an interview with ''GQ'' magazine [[Bernard Sumner]] said \"I haven't a clue what this is about.\" He agreed with the interviewer that his best known lyric is in the song: \"Pretending not to see his gun/I said, 'Let's go out and have some fun'\". The lyrics, he added, came about after the band was visiting a man's house in the United States who showed his guns under his bed before they went out for an enjoyable night. It had been quickly written, recorded and mixed without sleep before the band went on tour in Australia.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Gale |first=Lee |date=2012-03-29 |title= GQ&A: BERNARD SUMNER|url=http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/bernard-sumner-interview-2012-new-order|magazine= |location=New York City|publisher=Cond\u00e9 Nast |access-date=2017-01-31}}</ref>\n\nThe song's complex arrangement includes a number of instruments and methods not normally used by New Order. For example, a bridge features [[frog]]s croaking melodically. The band reportedly included them because Morris loved the effect and was looking for any excuse to use it. At the end of the track, the faint bleating of a (synthesized) sheep can be heard. Sheep samples would reappear in later New Order singles \"[[Fine Time]]\" and \"[[Ruined in a Day]]\". \n\nDespite being a fan favourite, the song was not performed live between 1993 and 2006 due to the complexity of converting the programs from the [[E-mu]] Emulator to the new [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] synthesizer. However, it returned to the live set at a performance in [[Athens]] on 3 June 2006.\n\n==Sleeve==\nThe [[Peter Saville (graphic designer)|Peter Saville]] sleeve is uniform silver with the word \"perfect\" embossed on the front side and \"kiss The\" on the back, like a wraparound band. It was about this time that the photographer Geoff Power [see \"[[Shellshock (song)|Shellshock]]\"] was introduced to Saville. So enamoured was Saville by Power's work that he originally offered the photographer the cover to ''Low-Life''. Then when that fell through, they worked on a cover for \"The Perfect Kiss\" using one of Power's photographs, which can be seen later in New Order's songbook, 'X'. With time running out and Saville's decision not to run with this image \u2013 it didn't fit in his subsequent portraits of the band on ''Low-Life'' \u2013 Power was offered an OMD album cover instead. Power decided to use the image for the New Order release, ''[[Shellshock (song)|Shellshock]]'', a year later.\n\n==Versions==\nLasting nearly 9 minutes, the full 12\" single version of the song is longer than even \"[[Blue Monday (New Order song)|Blue Monday]]\", New Order's 1983 dance epic. This version also appears on the vinyl edition of ''[[Substance 1987|Substance]]'', with the CD pressings deleting 44 seconds of the climactic finale, due to time limitations of the CD format in 1987 (future remasterings of ''Substance'' did not restore the missing 44 seconds, even though newer CDs would allow for it). The full version was eventually released unedited on the 2-disc deluxe edition of ''Low-Life'', marking its first appearance on CD.\n\nThe version on the original ''[[Low-Life]]'' and all post-''Substance'' compilations is a 4:48 edit that omits the third verse (the one that mentions the song's title) and fades out before the climax. This version is present on the A-side of the 7\" single from the Philippines; most 7\" issues from other countries have on the A-side a version that is further edited to 4:24 (in some or all cases without the percussion introduction). The UK 7\" promo release on Factory Records is a rarely heard edit cut by Ivan Ivan which compresses most of the elements of the full, 8:46 version (including the ending but not the third verse) into 3:50.\n\nThere is also a pre-edited recording of the live performance filmed for the music video with later overdubbed mistakes left intact; it is available on the bonus disc included with some editions of ''[[Retro (New Order album)|Retro]]'' and on various promotional vinyl releases.\n\nThe song has been remixed by third parties like [[Razormaid]] and Hot Tracks and has been covered by bands including Capsule Giants, Nude,<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.neworderonline.com/Music/Song.aspx?SongID=55\n|title=neworderonline.com\n|accessdate=2007-10-17\n}}, song browser entry for \"The Perfect Kiss\"</ref>\nInternational,<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.neworderonline.com/Common/Topic.aspx?Topic=InternationalBand\n|title=neworderonline.com\n|accessdate=2007-10-17\n}}, band bio for International</ref>\n[[Paradoxx]], Razed in a New Division of Agony,\nand Amoeba Crunch.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.amoebacrunch.com/L9123.html\n |title       = amoebacrunch.com\n |work        = The Perfect Kiss\n |accessdate  = 2007-10-17\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20140813141741/http://amoebacrunch.com/L9123.html\n |archivedate = 2014-08-13\n}}</ref>\n\n==B-sides==\n\"The Kiss of Death\" is a typical New Order dub version: it is a mostly instrumental [[remix]] of the A-side with added effects; it notably features the opening of the [[Low-Life|album version]]. \"Perfect Pit\" is a short recording of synthesized bass and drum parts that sounds like [[Gillian Gilbert]] and [[Stephen Morris (musician)|Stephen Morris]] practicing.\n\n==Music video==\n\n{{Infobox film\n| name = The Perfect Kiss\n| image = \n| caption = \n| director = [[Jonathan Demme]]\n| producer = [[Michael Shamberg]]\n| screenplay = \n| starring = [[New Order (band)|New Order]]\n| music = New Order\n| cinematography = [[Henri Alekan]]\n| editing = [[Tony Lawson]]\n| studio = Factory Films\n| distributor = [[Palace Pictures]]\n| released = Sept 1985\n| runtime = 11 minutes\n| country = United Kingdom\n| language = English\n}}\n\n[[Jonathan Demme]] directed \"The Perfect Kiss\" video, which is unlike any other New Order clip. Set in the band's practice room, it simply depicts the band playing the song from beginning to end. According to [[Factory Records]] owner [[Tony Wilson]], Demme was looking forward to filming dynamic shots of Stephen Morris behind the drum kit and was dismayed to find that the drums in the song were all programmed.\n\nThe video features a Joy Division poster for 'Unknown Pleasures' that can be prominently seen behind Bernard Sumner.\n\nThe video appeared on the ''Substance 1989'' [[VHS]] tape and the DVD ''A Collection''. An edit of the video version appeared on a US 12\" single in 1985. The full audio take, including Demme's remarks before and after the performance, appeared on a bonus CD included with early copies of the box set ''Retro''. Since it is a unique live performance, the video version of the song sounds different from other released versions.\n\n==Track listing==\n{{track listing\n| all_writing     = [[Gillian Gilbert]], [[Peter Hook]], [[Stephen Morris (musician)|Stephen Morris]] and [[Bernard Sumner]]\n| headline        = 12: FAC 123 (UK) / Qwest 9 20330-0 (US)\n\n| title1          = The Perfect Kiss\n| length1         = 8:46\n| title2          = Kiss of Death\n| length2         = 7:02\n| title3          = Perfect Pit\n| length3         = 1:24\n}}\n{{track listing\n| headline        = 7\": FAC 123 (UK)\n\n| title1          = The Perfect Kiss\n| length1         = 3:51\n| title2          = Kiss of Death\n| length2         = 3:01\n}}\n\n==Chart positions==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

The vinyl version has Factory catalogue number FAC 123 and the video has the opposite number, FAC 321.\n\n==Background==\nWhile widely regarded as a centrepiece of New Order's catalogue, \"The Perfect Kiss\" reached only number 46 in the UK charts. \n\nThe song's themes include love \"We believe in a land of love\" and death \"the perfect kiss is the kiss of death\".<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Lariviere |first=Aaron |date=2013-01-25 |title=The 10 Best New Order Songs|url=http://www.stereogum.com/1244332/the-10-best-new-order-songs/top-stories/|magazine= |location=New York City|publisher=Billboard-Hollywood Reporter Media Group |access-date=2017-01-31}}</ref> The overall meaning of the song is unclear to its writer today. In an interview with ''GQ'' magazine [[Bernard Sumner]] said \"I haven't a clue what this is about.\" He agreed with the interviewer that his best known lyric is in the song: \"Pretending not to see his gun/I said, 'Let's go out and have some fun'\". The lyrics, he added, came about after the band was visiting a man's house in the United States who showed his guns under his bed before they went out for an enjoyable night. It had been quickly written, recorded and mixed without sleep before the band went on tour in Australia.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Gale |first=Lee |date=2012-03-29 |title= GQ&A: BERNARD SUMNER|url=http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/bernard-sumner-interview-2012-new-order|magazine= |location=New York City|publisher=Cond\u00e9 Nast |access-date=2017-01-31}}</ref>\n\nThe song's complex arrangement includes a number of instruments and methods not normally used by New Order. For example, a bridge features [[frog]]s croaking melodically. The band reportedly included them because Morris loved the effect and was looking for any excuse to use it. At the end of the track, the faint bleating of a (synthesized) sheep can be heard. Sheep samples would reappear in later New Order singles \"[[Fine Time]]\" and \"[[Ruined in a Day]]\". \n\nDespite being a fan favourite, the song was not performed live between 1993 and 2006 due to the complexity of converting the programs from the [[E-mu]] Emulator to the new [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] synthesizer. However, it returned to the live set at a performance in [[Athens]] on 3 June 2006.\n\n==Sleeve==\nThe [[Peter Saville (graphic designer)|Peter Saville]] sleeve is uniform silver with the word \"perfect\" embossed on the front side and \"kiss The\" on the back, like a wraparound band. It was about this time that the photographer Geoff Power [see \"[[Shellshock (song)|Shellshock]]\"] was introduced to Saville. So enamoured was Saville by Power's work that he originally offered the photographer the cover to ''Low-Life''. Then when that fell through, they worked on a cover for \"The Perfect Kiss\" using one of Power's photographs, which can be seen later in New Order's songbook, 'X'. With time running out and Saville's decision not to run with this image \u2013 it didn't fit in his subsequent portraits of the band on ''Low-Life'' \u2013 Power was offered an OMD album cover instead. Power decided to use the image for the New Order release, ''[[Shellshock (song)|Shellshock]]'', a year later.\n\n==Versions==\nLasting nearly 9 minutes, the full 12\" single version of the song is longer than even \"[[Blue Monday (New Order song)|Blue Monday]]\", New Order's 1983 dance epic. This version also appears on the vinyl edition of ''[[Substance 1987|Substance]]'', with the CD pressings deleting 44 seconds of the climactic finale, due to time limitations of the CD format in 1987 (future remasterings of ''Substance'' did not restore the missing 44 seconds, even though newer CDs would allow for it). The full version was eventually released unedited on the 2-disc deluxe edition of ''Low-Life'', marking its first appearance on CD.\n\nThe version on the original ''[[Low-Life]]'' and all post-''Substance'' compilations is a 4:48 edit that omits the third verse (the one that mentions the song's title) and fades out before the climax. This version is present on the A-side of the 7\" single from the Philippines; most 7\" issues from other countries have on the A-side a version that is further edited to 4:24 (in some or all cases without the percussion introduction). The UK 7\" promo release on Factory Records is a rarely heard edit cut by Ivan Ivan which compresses most of the elements of the full, 8:46 version (including the ending but not the third verse) into 3:50.\n\nThere is also a pre-edited recording of the live performance filmed for the music video with later overdubbed mistakes left intact; it is available on the bonus disc included with some editions of ''[[Retro (New Order album)|Retro]]'' and on various promotional vinyl releases.\n\nThe song has been remixed by third parties like [[Razormaid]] and Hot Tracks and has been covered by bands including Capsule Giants, Nude,<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.neworderonline.com/Music/Song.aspx?SongID=55\n|title=neworderonline.com\n|accessdate=2007-10-17\n}}, song browser entry for \"The Perfect Kiss\"</ref>\nInternational,<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.neworderonline.com/Common/Topic.aspx?Topic=InternationalBand\n|title=neworderonline.com\n|accessdate=2007-10-17\n}}, band bio for International</ref>\n[[Paradoxx]], Razed in a New Division of Agony,\nand Amoeba Crunch.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.amoebacrunch.com/L9123.html\n |title       = amoebacrunch.com\n |work        = The Perfect Kiss\n |accessdate  = 2007-10-17\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20140813141741/http://amoebacrunch.com/L9123.html\n |archivedate = 2014-08-13\n}}</ref>\n\n==B-sides==\n\"The Kiss of Death\" is a typical New Order dub version: it is a mostly instrumental [[remix]] of the A-side with added effects; it notably features the opening of the [[Low-Life|album version]]. \"Perfect Pit\" is a short recording of synthesized bass and drum parts that sounds like [[Gillian Gilbert]] and [[Stephen Morris (musician)|Stephen Morris]] practicing.\n\n==Music video==\n\n{{Infobox film\n| name = The Perfect Kiss\n| image = \n| caption = \n| director = [[Jonathan Demme]]\n| producer = [[Michael Shamberg]]\n| screenplay = \n| starring = [[New Order (band)|New Order]]\n| music = New Order\n| cinematography = [[Henri Alekan]]\n| editing = [[Tony Lawson]]\n| studio = Factory Films\n| distributor = [[Palace Pictures]]\n| released = Sept 1985\n| runtime = 11 minutes\n| country = United Kingdom\n| language = English\n}}\n\n[[Jonathan Demme]] directed \"The Perfect Kiss\" video, which is unlike any other New Order clip. Set in the band's practice room, it simply depicts the band playing the song from beginning to end. According to [[Factory Records]] owner [[Tony Wilson]], Demme was looking forward to filming dynamic shots of Stephen Morris behind the drum kit and was dismayed to find that the drums in the song were all programmed.\n\nThe video features a Joy Division poster for 'Unknown Pleasures' that can be prominently seen behind Bernard Sumner.\n\nThe video appeared on the ''Substance 1989'' [[VHS]] tape and the DVD ''A Collection''. An edit of the video version appeared on a US 12\" single in 1985. The full audio take, including Demme's remarks before and after the performance, appeared on a bonus CD included with early copies of the box set ''Retro''. Since it is a unique live performance, the video version of the song sounds different from other released versions.\n\n==Track listing==\n{{track listing\n| all_writing     = [[Gillian Gilbert]], [[Peter Hook]], [[Stephen Morris (musician)|Stephen Morris]] and [[Bernard Sumner]]\n| headline        = 12: FAC 123 (UK) / Qwest 9 20330-0 (US)\n\n| title1          = The Perfect Kiss\n| length1         = 8:46\n| title2          = Kiss of Death\n| length2         = 7:02\n| title3          = Perfect Pit\n| length3         = 1:24\n}}\n{{track listing\n| headline        = 7\": FAC 123 (UK)\n\n| title1          = The Perfect Kiss\n| length1         = 3:51\n| title2          = Kiss of Death\n| length2         = 3:01\n}}\n\n==Chart positions==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!
