{"title_page": "Cognitive science of religion", "text_new": "{{More citations needed|date=February 2011}}\n{{Spirituality sidebar|experience}}\n'''Cognitive science of religion''' is the study of religious thought and behavior from the perspective of the cognitive science, and often engages with, and assumes as its foundation, evolutionary science. The field employs methods and theories from a very broad range of disciplines, including: [[cognitive psychology]], [[evolutionary psychology]], [[cognitive anthropology]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[developmental psychology]], and [[archaeology]].  Scholars in this field seek to explain how human minds acquire, generate, and transmit religious thoughts, practices, and schemas by means of ordinary cognitive capacities.\n\n==History==\nAlthough religion has been the subject of serious scientific study since at least the late nineteenth century, the study of religion as a cognitive phenomenon is relatively recent. While it often relies upon earlier research within [[anthropology of religion]]<ref>Geertz C. (1966) \"Religion as cultural system\" In: Banton, M. (ed) ''Anthropological approaches to the study of religion'' London: Tavistock p 1-46</ref> and [[sociology of religion]], cognitive science of religion considers the results of that work within the context of evolutionary and cognitive theories. As such, cognitive science of religion was only made possible by the [[cognitive revolution]] of the 1950s and the development, starting in the 1970s, of [[sociobiology]] and other approaches explaining human behaviour in evolutionary terms, especially [[evolutionary psychology]].\n\nWhile [[Dan Sperber]] foreshadowed cognitive science of religion in his 1975 book ''Rethinking Symbolism'', the earliest research to fall within the scope of the discipline was published during the 1980s. Among this work, [[Stewart E. Guthrie]]'s [https://www.academia.edu/209728/A_Cognitive_Theory_of_Religion \"A cognitive theory of religion\"]<ref>''Current Anthropology'' 21 (2) 1980, pp. 181-203.</ref> was significant for examining the significance of anthropomorphism within religion, work that ultimately led to the development of the concept of the [[hyperactive agency detection device]] \u2013 a key concept within cognitive science of religion.\n\nThe real beginning of cognitive science of religion can be dated to the 1990s. During that decade a large number of highly influential books and articles were published which helped to lay the foundations of cognitive science of religion. These included ''Rethinking Religion: Connecting Cognition and Culture'' and ''Bringing Ritual to Mind: Psychological Foundations of Cultural Forms'' by [[E. Thomas Lawson]] and [[Robert McCauley]], ''Naturalness of Religious Ideas'' by [[Pascal Boyer]], ''Inside the Cult'' and ''Arguments and Icons''&nbsp;by&nbsp;[[Harvey Whitehouse]], and Guthrie's book-length development of his earlier theories in ''Faces in the Clouds''. In the 1990s, these and other researchers, who had been working independently in a variety of different disciplines, discovered each other's work and found valuable parallels between their approaches, with the result that something of a self-aware research tradition began to coalesce. By 2000, the field was well-enough defined for [[Justin L. Barrett]] to coin the term 'cognitive science of religion' in his article [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1364-6613(99)01419-9 \"Exploring the natural foundations of religion\"].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Barrett|first1=Justin|title=Exploring the natural foundations of religion|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|date=1 January 2000|volume=4|issue=1|pages=29\u201334|doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(99)01419-9|pmid=10637620}}<!--|accessdate=5 April 2016--></ref>\n\nSince 2000, cognitive science of religion has grown,{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} similarly to other approaches that apply evolutionary thinking to sociological phenomena.

The field remains somewhat loosely defined, bringing together as it does researchers who come from a variety of different traditions. Much of the cohesion in the field comes not from shared detailed theoretical commitments but from a general willingness to view religion in cognitive and evolutionary terms as well as from the willingness to engage with the work of the others developing this field.

The cognitive byproduct explanation of religion is an application of the concept of [[spandrel (biology)]] and of the concept of  [[exaptation]] explored by [[Stephen Jay Gould]] among others.\n\n===Minimally counterintuitive concepts===\nConcepts that mostly fit human preconceptions but break with them in one or two striking ways. These concepts are both easy to remember (thanks to the counterintuitive elements) and easy to use (thanks to largely agreeing with what people expect). Examples include talking trees and noncorporeal agents. [[Pascal Boyer]] argues that many religious entities fit into this category.<ref>Boyer, Pascal. ''The Naturalness of Religious Ideas'' University of California Press, 1994.</ref> Upal<ref>Upal, M. A. (2010). \"An Alternative View of the Minimal Counterintuitiveness Effect\", ''Journal of Cognitive Systems Research'', 11(2), 194-203.</ref> labelled the fact that minimally counterintuitive ideas are better remembered than intuitive and maximally counterintuitive ideas as [[the minimal counterintuitiveness effect]] or the MCI-effect.\n\n===Hyperactive agency detection device===\n[[Cognitive scientist]] [[Justin L. Barrett]] postulates that this mental mechanism, whose function is to identify the activity of agents, may contribute to belief in the presence of the supernatural. Given the relative costs of failing to spot an agent, the mechanism is said to be hyperactive, producing a large number of [[Type I and type II errors|false positive errors]]. [[Stewart E. Guthrie (scientist)|Stewart E. Guthrie]] and others have claimed these errors can explain the appearance of supernatural concepts.\n\n===Pro-social adaptation===\nAccording to the prosocial adaptation account of religion, religious beliefs and practices should be understood as having the function of eliciting adaptive prosocial behaviour and avoiding the [[free rider problem]].<ref name=\"DSWilson2002\">{{cite book |last1=Wilson |first1=David Sloan |title=Darwin's cathedral : evolution, religion, and the nature of society |date=2002 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=9780226901350}}</ref> Within the cognitive science of religion this approach is primarily pursued by [[Richard Sosis]]. [[David Sloan Wilson]] is another major proponent of this approach and interprets religion as a group-level adaptation, but his work is generally seen as falling outside the cognitive science of religion.\n\n===Costly signaling===\nPractices that, due to their inherent cost, can be relied upon to provide an [[Signalling theory#Human honest signals|honest signal]] regarding the intentions of the agent. [[Richard Sosis]] has suggested that religious practices can be explained as costly signals of the willingness to cooperate. A similar line of argument has been pursued by [[Lyle Steadman]] and [[Craig Palmer]]. Alternatively, D. Jason Slone has argued that religiosity may be a costly signal used as a [[mating strategy]] in so far as religiosity serves as a proxy for \"family values.\"\n\n===Dual inheritance===\nIn the context of cognitive science of religion, dual inheritance theory can be understood as attempting to combine the cognitive byproduct and prosocial adaptation accounts using the theoretical approach developed by [[Robert Boyd (anthropologist)|Robert Boyd]] and [[Peter Richerson]], among others. The basic view is that while belief in supernatural entities is a cognitive byproduct, cultural traditions have recruited such beliefs to motivate prosocial behaviour. A sophisticated statement of this approach can be found in [[Scott Atran]] and [[Joseph Henrich]] (2010).<ref name=\"Atran2010\">{{cite journal |last1=Atran |first1=Scott |last2=Henrich |first2=Joseph |title=The Evolution of Religion: How Cognitive By-Products, Adaptive Learning Heuristics, Ritual Displays, and Group Competition Generate Deep Commitments to Prosocial Religions |journal=Biological Theory |date=14 April 2015 |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=18\u201330 |doi=10.1162/BIOT_a_00018}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cognitive ecology of religion]]\n* [[Psychology of religion]]\n* [[International Association for the Cognitive Science of Religion]] ([[IACSR]])\n* [[Science and Religion]]\n* [[Evolutionary epistemology]]\n* [[Evolutionary origin of religions]]\n* [[Evolutionary psychology of religion]]\n* [[Neurotheology]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* Atran, S., & Norenzayan, A.

A sophisticated statement of this approach can be found in [[Scott Atran]] and [[Joseph Henrich]] (2010).<ref name=\"Atran2010\">{{cite journal |last1=Atran |first1=Scott |last2=Henrich |first2=Joseph |title=The Evolution of Religion: How Cognitive By-Products, Adaptive Learning Heuristics, Ritual Displays, and Group Competition Generate Deep Commitments to Prosocial Religions |journal=Biological Theory |date=14 April 2015 |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=18\u201330 |doi=10.1162/BIOT_a_00018}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Psychology of religion]]\n* [[International Association for the Cognitive Science of Religion]] ([[IACSR]])\n* [[Science and Religion]]\n* [[Evolutionary epistemology]]\n* [[Evolutionary origin of religions]]\n* [[Evolutionary psychology of religion]]\n* [[Neurotheology]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* Atran, S., & Norenzayan, A.

The sequel to ''[[Bad Boys II]]'' (2003), it is the third installment in the [[Bad Boys (franchise)|''Bad Boys'' franchise]] and is based on a story by Craig and Carnahan. The film stars [[Will Smith]], [[Martin Lawrence]], [[Vanessa Hudgens]], [[Alexander Ludwig]], [[Charles Melton (actor)|Charles Melton]], [[Paola N\u00fa\u00f1ez]], [[Kate del Castillo]], [[Nicky Jam]], and [[Joe Pantoliano]]. Smith co-produced the film with [[Jerry Bruckheimer]] and [[Doug Belgrad]]. In ''Bad Boys for Life'', [[Miami]] detectives Mike Lowrey and Marcus Burnett investigate a string of murders tied to Lowrey's troubled past.\n\nA third ''Bad Boys'' film was discussed after the success of the second, with [[Michael Bay]] stating he would be interested in returning to direct, but budgetary constraints made going ahead difficult. The film went through several attempts to enter production over the course of a decade, with a variety of writers and directors attached. The project was eventually finalized and green-lit in October 2018, and filming began the following year, lasting from January to June 2019. [[Principal photography]] took place in [[Atlanta]], [[Miami]] and [[Mexico City]].\n\n''Bad Boys for Life'' was theatrically released in the United States on January 17, 2020, by [[Sony Pictures Releasing]], through [[Columbia Pictures]]. The film received mostly positive reviews from critics,<ref name=\"obenson\" /> and has grossed $425 million worldwide, making it the [[2020 in film|highest-grossing film of 2020]]. It is also the highest-grossing installment of the series and the biggest January release of all time.\n\n==Plot==\nIsabel Aretas, widow of cartel kingpin Benito, escapes from a Mexican prison with the aid of her son Armando. Isabel sends Armando to Miami, tasking him with recovering a substantial stash of money his father Benito had hidden, as well as assassinating the people responsible for his father's arrest and eventual death in prison. Isabel demands that Armando kill Miami detective Mike Lowrey last.\n\nIn Miami, Mike accompanies his partner Marcus Burnett to the birth of his first grandson. Desiring to spend more time with his family, the aging Marcus tells Mike he intends to retire, to Mike's chagrin. During a party celebrating Marcus' grandson, Mike is shot by Armando and left in a coma for months. Chastised by Isabel for targeting Mike first, Armando continues to assassinate other targets on his list during Mike's convalescence.\n\nFollowing Mike's recovery, he is determined to seek revenge and unsuccessfully attempts to recruit the now-retired Marcus, causing a fall out between them. Mike violently obtains the identity of arms dealer Booker Grassie from an informant. Realizing that Mike will not heed orders to stay away from the investigation, Captain Howard reluctantly allows him to work with the tech-driven team in charge, the Advanced Miami Metro Operations (AMMO), led by Mike's ex-girlfriend Rita. While the team surveils Grassie at an arms deal, Mike determines that the buyers intend to kill Grassie and intervenes, but fails to save him. Later, Marcus is called by Carver Remy, an old informant who believes the assassin is after him. Marcus contacts Mike and the pair travel to Carver, but are too late to save him. Armando escapes after a fistfight with Mike.\n\nCaptain Howard later reveals his intentions to retire as well, offering advice to Mike that he needs to find a path forward in life. He is abruptly assassinated by Armando moments later. The Captain's death pulls Marcus out of retirement, but he intends to work as a team with AMMO. They track down Grassie's accountant, who leads them to Lorenzo \"Zway-Lo\" Rodriguez. They infiltrate Zway-Lo's birthday party leading to a destructive car chase. Armando arrives in a helicopter to rescue Zway-Lo but kills him when he blocks Armando's ability to shoot the pursuing Mike. As he lines up a shot, Armando tells Mike \"Hasta el Fuego\". Gunfire from Marcus creates cover for Mike, who falls into the river below.\n\nAMMO is shuttered because of the failed operation. In private, Mike reveals to Marcus that Armando may be his son. Before partnering with Marcus, Mike worked as an undercover officer in the Aretas cartel where he met Isabel. They fell in love and intended to run away together, using \"Hasta el Fuego\" as a secret catchphrase. Mike ultimately remained loyal to the police, realizing how dangerous Isabel had become. Despite Mike's opposition, Marcus and AMMO join him in Mexico City to confront her.\n\nAt the Hildago Palace, Mike meets Isabel and scolds her for concealing the truth from him. A shootout quickly ensues between AMMO and Isabel's men. Marcus shoots the pilot of Isabel's support helicopter, causing it to crash into the central lobby and starting a fire. Marcus confronts Isabel, while Mike tries to explain the truth to Armando. Armando begins beating on Mike, but he refuses to retaliate. Demanding the truth from his mother, Isabel confirms to Armando that Mike is his father. Isabel inadvertently shoots Armando in the chest while aiming for Mike. Enraged, she attempts to finish Mike, but Rita intervenes and shoots Isabel, sending her falling into the flames below.\n\nSometime later, Rita has been promoted to police Captain, while Mike and Marcus are placed in charge of AMMO. Mike visits a remorseful Armando in prison, offering him a chance to earn some redemption. Armando accepts.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Will Smith]] as Detective Lieutenant Michael Eugene \"Mike\" Lowrey\n* [[Martin Lawrence]] as Detective Lieutenant Marcus Miles Burnett\n* [[Vanessa Hudgens]] as

and [[Joe Carnahan]]. The sequel to ''[[Bad Boys II]]'' (2003), it is the third installment in the [[Bad Boys (franchise)|''Bad Boys'' franchise]] and is based on a story by Craig and Carnahan. The film stars [[Will Smith]], [[Martin Lawrence]], [[Vanessa Hudgens]], [[Alexander Ludwig]], [[Charles Melton (actor)|Charles Melton]], [[Paola N\u00fa\u00f1ez]], [[Kate del Castillo]], [[Nicky Jam]], and [[Joe Pantoliano]]. Smith co-produced the film with [[Jerry Bruckheimer]] and [[Doug Belgrad]]. In ''Bad Boys for Life'', [[Miami]] detectives Mike Lowrey and Marcus Burnett investigate a string of murders tied to Lowrey's troubled past.\n\nA third ''Bad Boys'' film was discussed after the success of the second, with [[Michael Bay]] stating he would be interested in returning to direct, but budgetary constraints made going ahead difficult. The film went through several attempts to enter production over the course of a decade, with a variety of writers and directors attached. The project was eventually finalized and green-lit in October 2018, and filming began the following year, lasting from January to June 2019. [[Principal photography]] took place in [[Atlanta]], [[Miami]] and [[Mexico City]].\n\n''Bad Boys for Life'' was theatrically released in the United States on January 17, 2020, by [[Sony Pictures Releasing]], through [[Columbia Pictures]]. The film received mostly positive reviews from critics,<ref name=\"obenson\" /> and has grossed $425 million worldwide, making it the [[2020 in film|highest-grossing film of 2020]]. It is also the highest-grossing installment of the series and the biggest January release of all time.\n\n==Plot==\nIsabel Aretas, widow of cartel kingpin Benito, escapes from a Mexican prison with the aid of her son Armando. Isabel sends Armando to Miami, tasking him with recovering a substantial stash of money his father Benito had hidden, as well as assassinating the people responsible for his father's arrest and eventual death in prison. Isabel demands that Armando kill Miami detective Mike Lowrey last.\n\nIn Miami, Mike accompanies his partner Marcus Burnett to the birth of his first grandson. Desiring to spend more time with his family, the aging Marcus tells Mike he intends to retire, to Mike's chagrin. During a party celebrating Marcus' grandson, Mike is shot by Armando and left in a coma for months. Chastised by Isabel for targeting Mike first, Armando continues to assassinate other targets on his list during Mike's convalescence.\n\nFollowing Mike's recovery, he is determined to seek revenge and unsuccessfully attempts to recruit the now-retired Marcus, causing a fall out between them. Mike violently obtains the identity of arms dealer Booker Grassie from an informant. Realizing that Mike will not heed orders to stay away from the investigation, Captain Howard reluctantly allows him to work with the tech-driven team in charge, the Advanced Miami Metro Operations (AMMO), led by Mike's ex-girlfriend Rita. While the team surveils Grassie at an arms deal, Mike determines that the buyers intend to kill Grassie and intervenes, but fails to save him. Later, Marcus is called by Carver Remy, an old informant who believes the assassin is after him. Marcus contacts Mike and the pair travel to Carver, but are too late to save him. Armando escapes after a fistfight with Mike.\n\nCaptain Howard later reveals his intentions to retire as well, offering advice to Mike that he needs to find a path forward in life. He is abruptly assassinated by Armando moments later. The Captain's death pulls Marcus out of retirement, but he intends to work as a team with AMMO. They track down Grassie's accountant, who leads them to Lorenzo \"Zway-Lo\" Rodriguez. They infiltrate Zway-Lo's birthday party leading to a destructive car chase. Armando arrives in a helicopter to rescue Zway-Lo but kills him when he blocks Armando's ability to shoot the pursuing Mike. As he lines up a shot, Armando tells Mike \"Hasta el Fuego\". Gunfire from Marcus creates cover for Mike, who falls into the river below.\n\nAMMO is shuttered because of the failed operation. In private, Mike reveals to Marcus that Armando may be his son. Before partnering with Marcus, Mike worked as an undercover officer in the Aretas cartel where he met Isabel. They fell in love and intended to run away together, using \"Hasta el Fuego\" as a secret catchphrase. Mike ultimately remained loyal to the police, realizing how dangerous Isabel had become. Despite Mike's opposition, Marcus and AMMO join him in Mexico City to confront her.\n\nAt the Hildago Palace, Mike meets Isabel and scolds her for concealing the truth from him. A shootout quickly ensues between AMMO and Isabel's men. Marcus shoots the pilot of Isabel's support helicopter, causing it to crash into the central lobby and starting a fire. Marcus confronts Isabel, while Mike tries to explain the truth to Armando. Armando begins beating on Mike, but he refuses to retaliate. Demanding the truth from his mother, Isabel confirms to Armando that Mike is his father. Isabel inadvertently shoots Armando in the chest while aiming for Mike. Enraged, she attempts to finish Mike, but Rita intervenes and shoots Isabel, sending her falling into the flames below.\n\nSometime later, Rita has been promoted to police Captain, while Mike and Marcus are placed in charge of AMMO. Mike visits a remorseful Armando in prison, offering him a chance to earn some redemption. Armando accepts.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Will Smith]] as Detective Lieutenant Michael Eugene \"Mike\" Lowrey\n* [[Martin Lawrence]] as Detective Lieutenant Marcus Miles Burnett\n* [[Vanessa Hudgens]] as
