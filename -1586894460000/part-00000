The modern system of near-universal national conscription for young men dates to the [[French Revolution]] in the 1790s, where it became the basis of a very large and powerful [[military]]. Most [[Europe]]an nations later copied the system in peacetime, so that men at a certain age would serve 1\u20138 years on [[active duty]] and then transfer to the [[military reserve force|reserve force]].\n\n[[File:Conscription_map_of_the_world.svg|alt=|thumb|upright=2.2|{{legend|#8cd19d|No standing army}} {{legend|#5cacc4|No current enforced conscription}} \n{{legend|#6600ff|Active draft system, but less than 20% of the whole age group are recruited}} {{legend|#fcb653|Plan to abolish conscription by the current government<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/World/2016/Nov-02/379319-ukraine-removes-last-conscripts-from-war-zone.ashx|title=Ukraine removes last conscripts from war zone}}</ref><ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite web|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aipl/201612120018.aspx|title=Military conscription to stop completely from 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/a/kazakh-military-draft-/25131370.html|title=Kazakh Military Draft To End By 2016}}</ref>}}\n{{legend|#ff5254|Current ongoing conscription}} {{legend|#b9b9b9|No information}}]]\nConscription is controversial for a range of reasons, including [[conscientious objection]] to military engagements on religious or philosophical grounds; political objection, for example to service for a disliked government or unpopular war; and ideological objection, for example, to a perceived violation of individual rights. Those conscripted may evade service, sometimes by leaving the country,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://archives.cbc.ca/war_conflict/vietnam_war/topics/348/ |title=Seeking Sanctuary: Draft Dodgers |newspaper= CBC Digital Archives }}</ref> and seeking [[Right of asylum|asylum]] in another country. Some selection systems accommodate these attitudes by providing [[alternative service]] outside [[combat]]-operations roles or even outside the military, such as ''[[Siviilipalvelus]]'' (alternative civil service) in Finland, ''[[Zivildienst]]'' (compulsory community service) in Austria and Switzerland. Several countries conscript male soldiers not only for armed forces, but also for paramilitary agencies, which are dedicated to [[police]]-like ''domestic only'' service like [[Internal Troops|internal troops]], [[Border Guard|border guards]] or ''non-[[combat]]'' [[rescue|rescue duties]] like [[civil defence]].\n\nAs of the early 21st century, many states no longer conscript soldiers, relying instead upon professional militaries with [[volunteer military|volunteers]]. The ability to rely on such an arrangement, however, presupposes some degree of predictability with regard to both war-fighting requirements and the scope of hostilities. Many states that have abolished conscription still, therefore, reserve the power to resume conscription during wartime or times of crisis.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/second-world-war-wwii/ <!--Bot repaired link--> |title=World War II |encyclopedia=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]] }}</ref> States involved in wars or interstate rivalries are most likely to implement conscription, and democracies are less likely than autocracies to implement conscription.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Asal|first=Victor|last2=Conrad|first2=Justin|last3=Toronto|first3=Nathan|date=2017-08-01|title=I Want You!

Under that system those eligible were required to serve in the royal army in time of war. During times of peace they were instead required to provide labour for other activities of the state. In return for this service, people subject to it gained the right to hold land. It is possible that this right was not to hold land ''per se'' but specific land supplied by the state.<ref name=JN242>{{Cite book |title=Early Mesopotamia Society and Economy at the Dawn of History |last=Postgate |first=J.N. |authorlink= |year=1992 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-11032-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/earlymesopotamia00post/page/242 242] |url=https://archive.org/details/earlymesopotamia00post/page/242 }}</ref>\n\nVarious forms of avoiding military service are recorded. While it was outlawed by the [[Code of Hammurabi]], the hiring of substitutes appears to have been practiced both before and after the creation of the code. Later records show that Ilkum commitments could become regularly traded. In other places, people simply left their towns to avoid their Ilkum service. Another option was to sell Ilkum lands and the commitments along with them. With the exception of a few exempted classes, this was forbidden by the Code of Hammurabi.<ref name=JN243>{{Cite book |title=Early Mesopotamia Society and Economy at the Dawn of History |last=Postgate |first=J.N. |authorlink= |year=1992 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-11032-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/earlymesopotamia00post/page/243 243] |url=https://archive.org/details/earlymesopotamia00post/page/243 }}</ref>\n\n====Medieval levies====\n{{More citations needed section|date=July 2010}}\n\nIn medieval [[Scandinavia]] the ''lei\u00f0angr'' ([[Old Norse language|Old Norse]]), ''leidang'' ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]), ''leding'', ([[Danish language|Danish]]), ''ledung'' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]]), ''lichting'' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]), ''expeditio'' ([[Latin]]) or sometimes ''le\u00feing'' ([[English language|Old English]]), was a levy of free farmers conscripted into coastal fleets for seasonal excursions and in defence of the realm.\n\nThe bulk of the [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon English]] army, called the ''[[fyrd]]'', was composed of part-time English soldiers drawn from the freemen of each county. In the 690s Laws of [[Ine of Wessex|Ine]], three levels of fines are imposed on different social classes for neglecting military service.<ref>Attenborough ''Laws of the Earliest English Kings'' https://archive.org/stream/lawsofearliesten00grea#page/52\n</ref> Some modern writers claim military service was restricted to the landowning minor nobility. These [[thegn]]s were the land-holding aristocracy of the time and were required to serve with their own armour and weapons for a certain number of days each year. The historian David Sturdy has cautioned about regarding the ''fyrd'' as a precursor to a modern national army composed of all ranks of society, describing it as a \"ridiculous fantasy\":<blockquote>The persistent old belief that peasants and small farmers gathered to form a national army or ''fyrd'' is a strange delusion dreamt up by antiquarians in the late eighteenth or early nineteenth centuries to justify universal military conscription.<ref>Sturdy, David ''Alfred the Great'' Constable (1995), p. 153</ref></blockquote>\n\nMedieval levy in Poland was known as the ''[[pospolite ruszenie]]''.\n\n====Military slavery====\n[[File:Battle of Vienna.SultanMurads with janissaries.jpg|thumb|Ottoman [[janissaries]]]]\n\nThe system of military [[slaves]] was widely used in the Middle East, beginning with the creation of the corps of [[Turkic peoples|Turkish]] slave-soldiers (''[[ghulam]]s'' or ''[[mamluk]]s'') by the [[Abbasid caliph]] [[al-Mu'tasim]] in the 820s and 830s. The Turkish troops soon came to [[Anarchy at Samarra|dominate the government]], establishing a pattern throughout the Islamic world of a ruling military class, often separated by ethnicity, culture and even religion by the mass of the population, a paradigm that found its apogee in the [[Mamluks of Egypt]] and the [[Janissary]] corps of the [[Ottoman Empire]], institutions that survived until the early 19th century.\n\nIn the middle of the 14th century, Ottoman Sultan [[Murad I]] developed personal troops to be loyal to him, with a slave army called the ''[[Kap\u0131kulu]]''. The new force was built by taking Christian children from newly conquered lands, especially from the far areas of his empire, in a system known as the ''[[dev\u015firme]]'' (translated \"gathering\" or \"converting\"). The captive children were forced to convert to [[Islam]]. The Sultans [[Military use of children|had the young boys trained]] over several years. Those who showed special promise in fighting skills were trained in advanced warrior skills, put into the sultan's personal service, and turned into the [[Janissary|Janissaries]], the elite branch of the ''Kap\u0131kulu''. A number of distinguished military commanders of the Ottomans, and most of the imperial administrators and upper-level officials of the Empire, such as [[Pargal\u0131 \u0130brahim Pasha]] and [[Sokollu Mehmet Pa\u015fa]], were recruited in this way.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/med/lewis1.html |author=Bernard Lewis |title=Race and Slavery in the Middle East |publisher= Chapter readings for class at Fordham University }}</ref> By 1609, the Sultan's ''Kap\u0131kulu'' forces increased to about 100,000.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://coursesa.matrix.msu.edu/~fisher/hst373/readings/inalcik6.html |title=In the Service of the State and Military Class }}</ref>\n\nIn later years, Sultans turned to the [[Barbary Pirates]] to supply their Jannissaries corps. Their attacks on ships off the coast of Africa or in the Mediterranean, and subsequent capture of able-bodied men for ransom or sale provided some captives for the Sultan's system. Starting in the 17th century, Christian families living under the Ottoman rule began to submit their sons into the Kapikulu system willingly, as they saw this as a potentially invaluable career opportunity for their children. Eventually the Sultan turned to foreign volunteers from the warrior clans of [[Circassians]] in southern Russia to fill his Janissary armies. As a whole the system began to break down, the loyalty of the Jannissaries became increasingly suspect. [[Mahmud II]] forcibly disbanded the Janissary corps in 1826.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-300350/Janissary |title= Janissary corps, or Janizary, or Yeni\u00e7eri (Turkish military)|encyclopedia=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online]] }}</ref>\n\nSimilar to the Janissaries in origin and means of development were the Mamluks of Egypt in the [[Middle Ages]]. The [[Mamluks]] were usually captive non-Muslim Iranian and Turkish children who had been kidnapped or bought as slaves from the Barbary coasts. The Egyptians assimilated and trained the boys and young men to become Islamic soldiers who served the Muslim [[caliph]]s and the [[Ayyubid]] sultans during the [[Middle Ages]]. The first mamluks served the [[Abbasid]] caliphs in 9th-century [[Baghdad]]. Over time they became a powerful military [[caste]]. On more than one occasion, they seized power, for example, ruling [[Egypt]] from 1250 to 1517.\n\nFrom 1250 [[Egypt]] had been ruled by the [[Bahri dynasty]] of [[Kipchak people|Kipchak]] origin. Slaves from the [[Peoples of the Caucasus|Caucasus]] served in the army and formed an elite corp of troops. They eventually revolted in Egypt to form the [[Burgi dynasty]]. The Mamluks' excellent fighting abilities, massed Islamic armies, and overwhelming numbers succeeded in overcoming the Christian [[Crusades|Crusader]] fortresses in the Holy Land. The Mamluks were the most successful defense against the [[Ilkhanate|Mongol Ilkhanate]] of Persia and Iraq from entering Egypt.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sunnahonline.com/ilm/seerah/0075_popup11.htm |title=The Mamluk (Slave) Dynasty (Timeline) |newspaper=Sunnah Online |access-date=2008-03-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716163316/http://www.sunnahonline.com/ilm/seerah/0075_popup11.htm |archive-date=2011-07-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nOn the western coast of Africa, Berber Muslims captured non-Muslims to put to work as laborers. They generally converted the younger people to Islam and many became quite assimilated. In Morocco, the Berber looked south rather than north. The Moroccan Sultan [[Moulay Ismail]], called  \"the Bloodthirsty\" (1672\u20131727), employed a corps of 150,000 black slaves, called his [[Black Guard]].

Deputy [[Jean-Baptiste Jourdan]] gave its name to the 5 September 1798 Act, whose first article stated: \"Any Frenchman is a soldier and owes himself to the defense of the nation.\"  It enabled the creation of the ''[[Grande Arm\u00e9e]]'', what [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] called \"the nation in arms\", which overwhelmed European professional armies that often numbered only into the low tens of thousands.

The Prussians were used to relying on superior organization and tactical factors such as order of battle to focus superior troops against inferior ones. Given approximately equivalent forces, as was generally the case with professional armies, these factors showed considerable importance. However, they became considerably less important when the Prussian armies faced forces that outnumbered their own in some cases by more than ten to one. [[Gerhard von Scharnhorst|Scharnhorst]] advocated adopting the ''[[lev\u00e9e en masse]]'', the military conscription used by France. The ''Kr\u00fcmpersystem'' was the beginning of short-term compulsory service in Prussia, as opposed to the long-term conscription previously used.<ref>Dierk Walter.

Compared to these extensive costs, some would argue there is very little benefit; if there ever was a war then conscription and basic training could be completed quickly, and in any case there is little threat of a war in most countries with conscription. In the United States, every male resident is required by law to register with the [[Selective Service System]] within 30 days following his 18th birthday and be available for a draft; this is often accomplished automatically by a motor vehicle department during licensing or by voter registration.\n\nThe cost of conscription can be related to the [[parable of the broken window]] in anti-draft arguments. The cost of the work, military service, does not disappear even if no salary is paid. The work effort of the conscripts is effectively wasted, as an unwilling workforce is extremely inefficient. The impact is especially severe in wartime, when civilian professionals are forced to fight as amateur soldiers. Not only is the work effort of the conscripts wasted and productivity lost, but professionally skilled conscripts are also difficult to replace in the civilian workforce. Every soldier conscripted in the army is taken away from his civilian work, and away from contributing to the economy which funds the military. This may be less a problem in an agrarian or pre-industrialized state where the level of education is generally low, and where a worker is easily replaced by another. However, this is potentially more costly in a [[post-industrial society]] where educational levels are high and where the workforce is sophisticated and a replacement for a conscripted specialist is difficult to find. Even direr economic consequences result if the professional conscripted as an amateur soldier is killed or maimed for life; his work effort and productivity are lost.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=2136&chapter=195469&layout=html&Itemid=27#c_NIR_1360-016_footnote_nt1046 |title=Why Not a Volunteer Army? |accessdate=September 11, 2008 |author=Milton Friedman |year=1967 |work=New Individualist Review|author-link=Milton Friedman }}</ref>\n\n==Arguments in favor of conscription==\n\n===Political and moral motives===\n{{Further|Social contract|Social solidarity|Active citizenship}}\n[[File:Conscription in Iran 3.jpg|thumb|left|Conscription in [[Iran]]]]\n\n[[Jean Jacques Rousseau]] argued vehemently against professional armies, believing that it was the right and privilege of every citizen to participate to the defense of the whole society, and a mark of moral decline to leave this business to professionals.

The inhabitants of the demilitarized [[\u00c5land Islands]] are exempt from military service. By the Conscription Act of 1951, they are, however, required to serve a time at a local institution, like the coast guard. However, until such service has been arranged, they are freed from service obligation. The non-military service of \u00c5land islands has not been arranged since the introduction of the act, and there are no plans to institute it. The inhabitants of \u00c5land islands can also volunteer for military service on the mainland. As of 1995, women [[History of women in the military#Finland|are permitted]] to serve on a voluntary basis and pursue careers in the military after their initial voluntary military service.\n\nThe military service takes place in [[Finnish Defence Forces]] or in the [[Finnish Border Guard]]. All services of the Finnish Defence Forces train conscripts. However, the Border Guard trains conscripts only in land-based units, not in coast guard detachments or in the Border Guard Air Wing. Civilian service may take place in the Civilian Service Center in [[Lapinj\u00e4rvi (municipality)|Lapinj\u00e4rvi]] or in an accepted non-profit organization of educational, social or medical nature.\n\n=== Germany ===\n{{Main|Conscription in Germany}}\nBetween 1956 and 2011 conscription was mandatory for all male citizens in the German [[Bundeswehr|federal armed forces]] (German: ''Bundeswehr''), as well as for the [[Bundesgrenzschutz|Federal Border Guard]] (German: ''Bundesgrenzschutz'') in the 1970s (see [[Compulsory Border Guard Service|Border Guard Service]]). With the end of the [[Cold War]] the [[Cabinet of Germany|German government]] drastically reduced the size of its armed forces. The low demand for conscripts led to the suspension of compulsory conscription in 2011. Since then, only volunteer professionals serve in the ''Bundeswehr''.\n\n=== Greece ===\n{{update section|date=March 2017}}\n{{Main|Conscription in Greece}}\n[[File:Changing of the Guard-Unknown Soldier-Hellenic Army.jpg|thumb| [[Evzones]] of the [[Evzones|Presidential Guard]] in front of the [[Greek Parliament]] armed with M1 Garands.]]\nSince 1914, [[Greece]] has had a period of mandatory [[military]] service lasting 9 months for men between the ages of 16 and 45. Citizens discharged from active service are normally placed in the reserve and are subject to periodic recalls of 1\u201310 days at irregular intervals.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.stratologia.gr/pdf/N.3421-2005.pdf | title=Archived copy | accessdate=2012-04-10 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105224001/http://www.stratologia.gr/pdf/N.3421-2005.pdf | archivedate=2012-01-05 }}</ref>\n\nUniversal conscription was introduced in Greece during the military reforms of 1909, although various forms of selective conscription had been in place earlier. In more recent years, conscription was associated with the state of general mobilisation declared on July 20, 1974 due to the crisis in [[Cyprus]] (the mobilisation was formally ended on December 18, 2002).\n\nThe period of time that a conscript is required to serve has varied historically, between 12\u201336 months depending on various factors particular to the conscript, and the political situation. Although women are employed by the Greek army as officers and petty officers, they are not required to enlist, as men are. Soldiers receive no health insurance, but they are provided medical support during their army service, including hospitalization costs.\n\nSince 2009, [[Greece]] has mandatory military service of 9 months for male citizens between the ages of 19 and 45. However, as the Armed forces had been gearing towards a completely professional army, the government had announced that the mandatory military service period would be cut to 6 months by 2008 or even abolished completely. However, this timetable was under reconsideration as of April 2006, due to severe manpower shortages. These had been caused by a combination of financial difficulties, meaning that professional soldiers could not be hired at the projected rate, and widespread abuse of the deferment process, resulting in two-thirds of the conscripts deferred service in 2005. In August 2009, the mandatory service period was reduced to 9 months for the army, but has remained at 12 months for the navy and the air force. The number of conscripts affected to the latter two has been greatly reduced, with an aim towards full professionalisation.\n\n=== Israel ===\n{{Main|Conscription in Israel}}\nThere is a mandatory service for all men and women who are fit and 18 years old. Men must serve 32 months while women serve 24 months with some exempt from mandatory service:\n* Muslim and Christian Arabs\n* permanent residents such as the [[Druze]] of the Golan Heights\n* Ultra-Orthodox Jews can apply for deferment to study in [[Yeshiva]] and the deferment tends to become an exemption\n* Female religious Jews, if they declare they are unable to serve due to religious grounds.

[[Napoleon]]'s brother [[Louis Bonaparte]], who was [[King of Holland]] from 1806 to 1810, had tried to introduce conscription a few years earlier, unsuccessfully. Every man aged 20 years or older had to enlist. By means of drawing lots it was decided who had to undertake service in the French army. It was possible to arrange a substitute against payment.\n\nLater on, conscription was used for all men over the age of 18. Postponement was possible, due to study, for example. Conscientious objectors could perform an alternative civilian service instead of military service. For various reasons, this forced military service was criticized at the end of the twentieth century. Since the Cold War was over, so was the direct threat of a war. Instead, the Dutch army was employed in more and more peacekeeping operations. The complexity and danger of these missions made the use of conscripts controversial. Furthermore, the conscription system was thought to be unfair as only men were drafted.\n\nIn the European part of Netherlands, compulsory attendance has been officially suspended since 1 May 1997. Between 1991 and 1996, the Dutch armed forces phased out their conscript personnel and converted to an all-professional force. The last conscript troops were inducted in 1995, and demobilized in 1996. The suspension means that citizens are no longer forced to serve in the armed forces, as long as it is not required for the safety of the country. Since then, the Dutch army has become an all-professional force.

However, women who were already working in a skilled job considered helpful to the war effort, such as a [[General Post Office]] telephonist, were told to continue working as before. None was assigned to combat roles unless she volunteered. By 1943 women were liable to some form of directed labour up to age 51.

The modern system of near-universal national conscription for young men dates to the [[French Revolution]] in the 1790s, where it became the basis of a very large and powerful [[military]]. Most [[Europe]]an nations later copied the system in peacetime, so that men at a certain age would serve 1\u20138 years on [[active duty]] and then transfer to the [[military reserve force|reserve force]].\n\n[[File:Conscription_map_of_the_world.svg|alt=|thumb|upright=2.2|{{legend|#8cd19d|No standing army}} {{legend|#5cacc4|No current enforced conscription}} \n{{legend|#6600ff|Active draft system, but less than 20% of the whole age group are recruited}} {{legend|#fcb653|Plan to abolish conscription by the current government<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/World/2016/Nov-02/379319-ukraine-removes-last-conscripts-from-war-zone.ashx|title=Ukraine removes last conscripts from war zone}}</ref><ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite web|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aipl/201612120018.aspx|title=Military conscription to stop completely from 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/a/kazakh-military-draft-/25131370.html|title=Kazakh Military Draft To End By 2016}}</ref>}}\n{{legend|#ff5254|Current ongoing conscription}} {{legend|#b9b9b9|No information}}]]\nConscription is controversial for a range of reasons, including [[conscientious objection]] to military engagements on religious or philosophical grounds; political objection, for example to service for a disliked government or unpopular war; and ideological objection, for example, to a perceived violation of individual rights. Those conscripted may evade service, sometimes by leaving the country,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://archives.cbc.ca/war_conflict/vietnam_war/topics/348/ |title=Seeking Sanctuary: Draft Dodgers |newspaper= CBC Digital Archives }}</ref> and seeking [[Right of asylum|asylum]] in another country. Some selection systems accommodate these attitudes by providing [[alternative service]] outside [[combat]]-operations roles or even outside the military, such as ''[[Siviilipalvelus]]'' (alternative civil service) in Finland, ''[[Zivildienst]]'' (compulsory community service) in Austria and Switzerland. Several countries conscript male soldiers not only for armed forces, but also for paramilitary agencies, which are dedicated to [[police]]-like ''domestic only'' service like [[Internal Troops|internal troops]], [[Border Guard|border guards]] or ''non-[[combat]]'' [[rescue|rescue duties]] like [[civil defence]].\n\nAs of the early 21st century, many states no longer conscript soldiers, relying instead upon professional militaries with [[volunteer military|volunteers]]. The ability to rely on such an arrangement, however, presupposes some degree of predictability with regard to both war-fighting requirements and the scope of hostilities. Many states that have abolished conscription still, therefore, reserve the power to resume conscription during wartime or times of crisis.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/second-world-war-wwii/ <!--Bot repaired link--> |title=World War II |encyclopedia=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]] }}</ref> States involved in wars or interstate rivalries are most likely to implement conscription, and democracies are less likely than autocracies to implement conscription.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Asal|first=Victor|last2=Conrad|first2=Justin|last3=Toronto|first3=Nathan|date=2017-08-01|title=I Want You!

Under that system those eligible were required to serve in the royal army in time of war. During times of peace they were instead required to provide labour for other activities of the state. In return for this service, people subject to it gained the right to hold land. It is possible that this right was not to hold land ''per se'' but specific land supplied by the state.<ref name=JN242>{{Cite book |title=Early Mesopotamia Society and Economy at the Dawn of History |last=Postgate |first=J.N. |authorlink= |year=1992 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-11032-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/earlymesopotamia00post/page/242 242] |url=https://archive.org/details/earlymesopotamia00post/page/242 }}</ref>\n\nVarious forms of avoiding military service are recorded. While it was outlawed by the [[Code of Hammurabi]], the hiring of substitutes appears to have been practiced both before and after the creation of the code. Later records show that Ilkum commitments could become regularly traded. In other places, people simply left their towns to avoid their Ilkum service. Another option was to sell Ilkum lands and the commitments along with them.

In the 690s Laws of [[Ine of Wessex|Ine]], three levels of fines are imposed on different social classes for neglecting military service.<ref>Attenborough ''Laws of the Earliest English Kings'' https://archive.org/stream/lawsofearliesten00grea#page/52\n</ref> Some modern writers claim military service was restricted to the landowning minor nobility. These [[thegn]]s were the land-holding aristocracy of the time and were required to serve with their own armour and weapons for a certain number of days each year. The historian David Sturdy has cautioned about regarding the ''fyrd'' as a precursor to a modern national army composed of all ranks of society, describing it as a \"ridiculous fantasy\":<blockquote>The persistent old belief that peasants and small farmers gathered to form a national army or ''fyrd'' is a strange delusion dreamt up by antiquarians in the late eighteenth or early nineteenth centuries to justify universal military conscription.<ref>Sturdy, David ''Alfred the Great'' Constable (1995), p. 153</ref></blockquote>\n\nMedieval levy in Poland was known as the ''[[pospolite ruszenie]]''.\n\n====Military slavery====\n[[File:Battle of Vienna.SultanMurads with janissaries.jpg|thumb|Ottoman [[janissaries]]]]\n\nThe system of military [[slaves]] was widely used in the Middle East, beginning with the creation of the corps of [[Turkic peoples|Turkish]] slave-soldiers (''[[ghulam]]s'' or ''[[mamluk]]s'') by the [[Abbasid caliph]] [[al-Mu'tasim]] in the 820s and 830s. The Turkish troops soon came to [[Anarchy at Samarra|dominate the government]], establishing a pattern throughout the Islamic world of a ruling military class, often separated by ethnicity, culture and even religion by the mass of the population, a paradigm that found its apogee in the [[Mamluks of Egypt]] and the [[Janissary]] corps of the [[Ottoman Empire]], institutions that survived until the early 19th century.\n\nIn the middle of the 14th century, Ottoman Sultan [[Murad I]] developed personal troops to be loyal to him, with a slave army called the ''[[Kap\u0131kulu]]''. The new force was built by taking Christian children from newly conquered lands, especially from the far areas of his empire, in a system known as the ''[[dev\u015firme]]'' (translated \"gathering\" or \"converting\"). The captive children were forced to convert to [[Islam]]. The Sultans [[Military use of children|had the young boys trained]] over several years. Those who showed special promise in fighting skills were trained in advanced warrior skills, put into the sultan's personal service, and turned into the [[Janissary|Janissaries]], the elite branch of the ''Kap\u0131kulu''. A number of distinguished military commanders of the Ottomans, and most of the imperial administrators and upper-level officials of the Empire, such as [[Pargal\u0131 \u0130brahim Pasha]] and [[Sokollu Mehmet Pa\u015fa]], were recruited in this way.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/med/lewis1.html |author=Bernard Lewis |title=Race and Slavery in the Middle East |publisher= Chapter readings for class at Fordham University }}</ref> By 1609, the Sultan's ''Kap\u0131kulu'' forces increased to about 100,000.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://coursesa.matrix.msu.edu/~fisher/hst373/readings/inalcik6.html |title=In the Service of the State and Military Class }}</ref>\n\nIn later years, Sultans turned to the [[Barbary Pirates]] to supply their Jannissaries corps. Their attacks on ships off the coast of Africa or in the Mediterranean, and subsequent capture of able-bodied men for ransom or sale provided some captives for the Sultan's system. Starting in the 17th century, Christian families living under the Ottoman rule began to submit their sons into the Kapikulu system willingly, as they saw this as a potentially invaluable career opportunity for their children. Eventually the Sultan turned to foreign volunteers from the warrior clans of [[Circassians]] in southern Russia to fill his Janissary armies. As a whole the system began to break down, the loyalty of the Jannissaries became increasingly suspect. [[Mahmud II]] forcibly disbanded the Janissary corps in 1826.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-300350/Janissary |title= Janissary corps, or Janizary, or Yeni\u00e7eri (Turkish military)|encyclopedia=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online]] }}</ref>\n\nSimilar to the Janissaries in origin and means of development were the Mamluks of Egypt in the [[Middle Ages]]. The [[Mamluks]] were usually captive non-Muslim Iranian and Turkish children who had been kidnapped or bought as slaves from the Barbary coasts. The Egyptians assimilated and trained the boys and young men to become Islamic soldiers who served the Muslim [[caliph]]s and the [[Ayyubid]] sultans during the [[Middle Ages]]. The first mamluks served the [[Abbasid]] caliphs in 9th-century [[Baghdad]]. Over time they became a powerful military [[caste]]. On more than one occasion, they seized power, for example, ruling [[Egypt]] from 1250 to 1517.\n\nFrom 1250 [[Egypt]] had been ruled by the [[Bahri dynasty]] of [[Kipchak people|Kipchak]] origin. Slaves from the [[Peoples of the Caucasus|Caucasus]] served in the army and formed an elite corp of troops. They eventually revolted in Egypt to form the [[Burgi dynasty]]. The Mamluks' excellent fighting abilities, massed Islamic armies, and overwhelming numbers succeeded in overcoming the Christian [[Crusades|Crusader]] fortresses in the Holy Land. The Mamluks were the most successful defense against the [[Ilkhanate|Mongol Ilkhanate]] of Persia and Iraq from entering Egypt.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sunnahonline.com/ilm/seerah/0075_popup11.htm |title=The Mamluk (Slave) Dynasty (Timeline) |newspaper=Sunnah Online |access-date=2008-03-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716163316/http://www.sunnahonline.com/ilm/seerah/0075_popup11.htm |archive-date=2011-07-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nOn the western coast of Africa, Berber Muslims captured non-Muslims to put to work as laborers. They generally converted the younger people to Islam and many became quite assimilated. In Morocco, the Berber looked south rather than north. The Moroccan Sultan [[Moulay Ismail]], called  \"the Bloodthirsty\" (1672\u20131727), employed a corps of 150,000 black slaves, called his [[Black Guard]].

The Prussians were used to relying on superior organization and tactical factors such as order of battle to focus superior troops against inferior ones. Given approximately equivalent forces, as was generally the case with professional armies, these factors showed considerable importance. However, they became considerably less important when the Prussian armies faced forces that outnumbered their own in some cases by more than ten to one. [[Gerhard von Scharnhorst|Scharnhorst]] advocated adopting the ''[[lev\u00e9e en masse]]'', the military conscription used by France. The ''Kr\u00fcmpersystem'' was the beginning of short-term compulsory service in Prussia, as opposed to the long-term conscription previously used.<ref>Dierk Walter.

The decision said the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]] gave [[United States Congress|Congress]] the power to [[declare war]] and to raise and support armies. The Court emphasized the principle of the reciprocal rights and duties of citizens:\n:\"It may not be doubted that the very conception of a just government in its duty to the citizen includes the reciprocal obligation of the citizen to render military service in case of need and the right to compel.\"<ref>John Whiteclay Chambers II, ''To Raise an Army: The Draft Comes to Modern America'' (1987) pp. 219\u201320</ref>\n\n===Economic===\nIt can be argued that in a [[benefit\u2013cost ratio|cost-to-benefit ratio]], conscription during peacetime is not worthwhile.<ref>Henderson, David R. \"[http://econjwatch.org/issues/volume-2-issue-2-august-2005 The Role of Economists in Ending the Draft]\" (August 2005).</ref> Months or years of service performed by the most fit and capable subtract from the productivity of the economy; add to this the cost of training them, and in some countries paying them. Compared to these extensive costs, some would argue there is very little benefit; if there ever was a war then conscription and basic training could be completed quickly, and in any case there is little threat of a war in most countries with conscription. In the United States, every male resident is required by law to register with the [[Selective Service System]] within 30 days following his 18th birthday and be available for a draft; this is often accomplished automatically by a motor vehicle department during licensing or by voter registration.\n\nThe cost of conscription can be related to the [[parable of the broken window]] in anti-draft arguments. The cost of the work, military service, does not disappear even if no salary is paid. The work effort of the conscripts is effectively wasted, as an unwilling workforce is extremely inefficient. The impact is especially severe in wartime, when civilian professionals are forced to fight as amateur soldiers. Not only is the work effort of the conscripts wasted and productivity lost, but professionally skilled conscripts are also difficult to replace in the civilian workforce. Every soldier conscripted in the army is taken away from his civilian work, and away from contributing to the economy which funds the military. This may be less a problem in an agrarian or pre-industrialized state where the level of education is generally low, and where a worker is easily replaced by another. However, this is potentially more costly in a [[post-industrial society]] where educational levels are high and where the workforce is sophisticated and a replacement for a conscripted specialist is difficult to find. Even direr economic consequences result if the professional conscripted as an amateur soldier is killed or maimed for life; his work effort and productivity are lost.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=2136&chapter=195469&layout=html&Itemid=27#c_NIR_1360-016_footnote_nt1046 |title=Why Not a Volunteer Army? |accessdate=September 11, 2008 |author=Milton Friedman |year=1967 |work=New Individualist Review|author-link=Milton Friedman }}</ref>\n\n==Arguments in favor of conscription==\n\n===Political and moral motives===\n{{Further|Social contract|Social solidarity|Active citizenship}}\n[[File:Conscription in Iran 3.jpg|thumb|left|Conscription in [[Iran]]]]\n\n[[Jean Jacques Rousseau]] argued vehemently against professional armies, believing that it was the right and privilege of every citizen to participate to the defense of the whole society, and a mark of moral decline to leave this business to professionals.

The inhabitants of the demilitarized [[\u00c5land Islands]] are exempt from military service. By the Conscription Act of 1951, they are, however, required to serve a time at a local institution, like the coast guard. However, until such service has been arranged, they are freed from service obligation. The non-military service of \u00c5land islands has not been arranged since the introduction of the act, and there are no plans to institute it. The inhabitants of \u00c5land islands can also volunteer for military service on the mainland. As of 1995, women [[History of women in the military#Finland|are permitted]] to serve on a voluntary basis and pursue careers in the military after their initial voluntary military service.\n\nThe military service takes place in [[Finnish Defence Forces]] or in the [[Finnish Border Guard]]. All services of the Finnish Defence Forces train conscripts. However, the Border Guard trains conscripts only in land-based units, not in coast guard detachments or in the Border Guard Air Wing. Civilian service may take place in the Civilian Service Center in [[Lapinj\u00e4rvi (municipality)|Lapinj\u00e4rvi]] or in an accepted non-profit organization of educational, social or medical nature.\n\n=== Germany ===\n{{Main|Conscription in Germany}}\nBetween 1956 and 2011 conscription was mandatory for all male citizens in the German [[Bundeswehr|federal armed forces]] (German: ''Bundeswehr''), as well as for the [[Bundesgrenzschutz|Federal Border Guard]] (German: ''Bundesgrenzschutz'') in the 1970s (see [[Compulsory Border Guard Service|Border Guard Service]]). With the end of the [[Cold War]] the [[Cabinet of Germany|German government]] drastically reduced the size of its armed forces. The low demand for conscripts led to the suspension of compulsory conscription in 2011. Since then, only volunteer professionals serve in the ''Bundeswehr''.\n\n=== Greece ===\n{{update section|date=March 2017}}\n{{Main|Conscription in Greece}}\n[[File:Changing of the Guard-Unknown Soldier-Hellenic Army.jpg|thumb| [[Evzones]] of the [[Evzones|Presidential Guard]] in front of the [[Greek Parliament]] armed with M1 Garands.]]\nSince 1914, [[Greece]] has had a period of mandatory [[military]] service lasting 9 months for men between the ages of 16 and 45.

In more recent years, conscription was associated with the state of general mobilisation declared on July 20, 1974 due to the crisis in [[Cyprus]] (the mobilisation was formally ended on December 18, 2002).\n\nThe period of time that a conscript is required to serve has varied historically, between 12\u201336 months depending on various factors particular to the conscript, and the political situation. Although women are employed by the Greek army as officers and petty officers, they are not required to enlist, as men are. Soldiers receive no health insurance, but they are provided medical support during their army service, including hospitalization costs.\n\nSince 2009, [[Greece]] has mandatory military service of 9 months for male citizens between the ages of 19 and 45. However, as the Armed forces had been gearing towards a completely professional army, the government had announced that the mandatory military service period would be cut to 6 months by 2008 or even abolished completely. However, this timetable was under reconsideration as of April 2006, due to severe manpower shortages. These had been caused by a combination of financial difficulties, meaning that professional soldiers could not be hired at the projected rate, and widespread abuse of the deferment process, resulting in two-thirds of the conscripts deferred service in 2005. In August 2009, the mandatory service period was reduced to 9 months for the army, but has remained at 12 months for the navy and the air force. The number of conscripts affected to the latter two has been greatly reduced, with an aim towards full professionalisation.\n\n=== Israel ===\n{{Main|Conscription in Israel}}\nThere is a mandatory service for all men and women who are fit and 18 years old. Men must serve 32 months while women serve 24 months with some exempt from mandatory service:\n* Muslim and Christian Arabs\n* permanent residents such as the [[Druze]] of the Golan Heights\n* Ultra-Orthodox Jews can apply for deferment to study in [[Yeshiva]] and the deferment tends to become an exemption\n* Female religious Jews, if they declare they are unable to serve due to religious grounds.

[[Napoleon]]'s brother [[Louis Bonaparte]], who was [[King of Holland]] from 1806 to 1810, had tried to introduce conscription a few years earlier, unsuccessfully. Every man aged 20 years or older had to enlist. By means of drawing lots it was decided who had to undertake service in the French army. It was possible to arrange a substitute against payment.\n\nLater on, conscription was used for all men over the age of 18. Postponement was possible, due to study, for example. Conscientious objectors could perform an alternative civilian service instead of military service. For various reasons, this forced military service was criticized at the end of the twentieth century. Since the Cold War was over, so was the direct threat of a war. Instead, the Dutch army was employed in more and more peacekeeping operations. The complexity and danger of these missions made the use of conscripts controversial. Furthermore, the conscription system was thought to be unfair as only men were drafted.\n\nIn the European part of Netherlands, compulsory attendance has been officially suspended since 1 May 1997. Between 1991 and 1996, the Dutch armed forces phased out their conscript personnel and converted to an all-professional force. The last conscript troops were inducted in 1995, and demobilized in 1996. The suspension means that citizens are no longer forced to serve in the armed forces, as long as it is not required for the safety of the country. Since then, the Dutch army has become an all-professional force.

However, women who were already working in a skilled job considered helpful to the war effort, such as a [[General Post Office]] telephonist, were told to continue working as before. None was assigned to combat roles unless she volunteered. By 1943 women were liable to some form of directed labour up to age 51.

He was elected [[Member of Parliament]] in a contest and was classed as a Tory and named as a \u2018worthy patriot\u2019 who  helped expose the mismanagements of the previous Whig government. He offended some Tories for abstaining on 24 January1712 when the House voted on the motion censuring the Duke of Marlborough for his \u2018unwarrantable and illegal\u2019 acceptance of money from bread contractors.  As a result he damaged his political standing at Warwick.   He also voted 'whimsically' on 18 June 1713 against the French commerce bill. At the [[1713 British general election|1713 general election]], he expected not to be put forward for Warwick, but made no attempt to find another constituency. In the following year his maternal uncle, Hon. [[Thomas Watson Wentworth]],   returned him for [[Higham Ferrers (UK Parliament constituency)|Higham Ferrers]] at a by-election on 12 March 1714 and he was returned again at the  [[1715 British general election|1715 general election]].<ref name=HOP/>\n \nHaving been a Tory who might often vote Whig, Leigh became a strong opponent of Walpole\u2019s administration and from 1715, voted against the Government in all recorded divisions.

He did not stand at the  [[1727 British general election|1727 general election]], but was returned for Bedfordshire  at a by-election on 16 February 1733.

Its wireless [[Joy-Con]] controllers, with standard buttons and directional analog sticks for user input, motion sensing, and tactile feedback, can attach to both sides of the console to support [[Handheld game console|handheld]]-style play. They can also connect to a Grip accessory to provide a traditional home console [[gamepad]] form, or be used individually in the hand like the [[Wii Remote|Wii Remote and Nunchuk]], supporting local multiplayer modes. The Nintendo Switch's software supports [[online game|online gaming]] through Internet connectivity, as well as local [[Wireless ad hoc network|wireless ad hoc]] connectivity with other consoles. Nintendo Switch games and software are available on both physical [[flash storage|flash]]-based [[Nintendo game card|ROM cartridges]] and [[digital distribution]] via [[Nintendo eShop]]; the system has no [[Regional lockout|region lockout]]. A handheld-focused revision of the system, called the [[Nintendo Switch Lite]], was released on September 20, 2019. \n\nThe Nintendo Switch was unveiled on October 20, 2016. Known in development by its codename '''NX''', the concept of the Switch came about as Nintendo's reaction to several quarters of financial losses into 2014, attributed to poor sales of its previous console, the [[Wii U]], and market competition from [[mobile gaming]]. Nintendo's then-president [[Satoru Iwata]] pushed the company towards mobile gaming and novel hardware. The Nintendo Switch's design is aimed at a wide demographic of video game players through the multiple modes of use. Nintendo opted to use more standard electronic components, such as a chipset based on [[Nvidia]]'s [[Tegra]] line, to make development for the console easier for programmers and more compatible with existing [[game engine]]s. As the Wii U had struggled to gain external support, leaving it with a weak software library, Nintendo preemptively sought the support of many [[Video game developer#Third-party developers|third-party developers and publishers]] to help build out the Switch's game library alongside Nintendo's own first-party titles, including many [[independent video game]] studios. While Nintendo initially anticipated around 100 titles for its first year, over 320 titles from first-party, third-party, and independent developers were released by the end of 2017.\n\nAs an [[Eighth generation of video game consoles|eighth-generation]] console, the Nintendo Switch competes with [[Microsoft]]'s [[Xbox One]] and [[Sony]]'s [[PlayStation 4]]. The console shipped nearly three million in the first month of its launch, exceeding Nintendo's initial projection of two million, and within a year of release achieved over 14 million units sold worldwide, outselling total lifetime sales of the Wii U. By the start of 2018, the Switch became the fastest-selling home console in both Japan and the United States. {{As of|2019|December}}, the Nintendo Switch and Switch Lite have sold more than 52 million units worldwide. Switch sales have been strongly tied to sales of Nintendo's first-party titles, with six games, ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild]]'', ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]'', ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]'', ''[[Mario Kart 8 Deluxe]]'', ''[[Pok\u00e9mon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!|Pok\u00e9mon: Let's Go]]'' and [[Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield|''Pok\u00e9mon Sword'' and ''Shield'']] having sold over ten million units each.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Background ===\nNintendo had seen record revenues, net sales and profits in 2009 as a result of the release of the [[Wii]] and [[Nintendo DS]] in 2006 and 2004 respectively,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/business/nintendo-defies-recession-with-record-profits-20090507-awdo.html|title=Nintendo defies recession with record profits|date=May 7, 2009|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=September 9, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2004/09/21/official-nintendo-ds-launch-details|title=Official Nintendo DS Launch Details|last=Harris|first=Craig|date=September 20, 2004|website=IGN|language=en-US|access-date=September 9, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"2009 Annual Financial\">{{Cite report|publisher=Nintendo|year=2009|accessdate=September 3, 2015|title=2009 Annual Financial Report: Financial Section|url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2009/annual0903e.pdf|page=17}}</ref> but in Nintendo's subsequent years, its revenues had declined.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://business.time.com/2014/01/17/nintendo-chief-we-failed/|title=Nintendo Chief: 'We Failed'|last=Nicks|first=Denver|date=January 17, 2014|work=Time|access-date=March 1, 2019|language=en|issn=0040-781X}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/3850264/nintendo-sales-wii-u-3ds-universal-studios/|title=Why Nintendo is Suddenly Profitable Again|last=Luckerson|first=Victor|date=May 7, 2015|website=Time|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=March 1, 2019}}</ref> The company had posted its first loss as a video game company in 2012 prior to the [[Wii U]]'s introduction that year, and had similar losses in the following years due to the console's poor uptake.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/25/technology/nintendos-wii-u-takes-aim-at-a-changed-video-game-world.html|title=Nintendo's Wii U Takes Aim at a Changed Video Game World|last=Wingfield|first=Nick|access-date=November 21, 2018|language=en}}</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]'' attributed Nintendo lowering financial forecasts in 2014 to weak hardware sales against [[mobile gaming]].<ref>{{Cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/18/technology/resisting-mobile-hurts-nintendos-bottom-line.html?_r=0 | title = Resisting Mobile Hurts Nintendo's Bottom Line | first = Nick | last = Wingfield | date = January 18, 2014 | accessdate = December 9, 2016 | website = [[New York Times]] | url-status=live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170728200642/https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/18/technology/resisting-mobile-hurts-nintendos-bottom-line.html?_r=0 | archivedate = July 28, 2017 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> Previously, the company had been hesitant about this market, with then-president [[Satoru Iwata]] considering that they would \"cease to be Nintendo\" and lose their identity if they attempted to enter it.<ref>{{Cite web|first=Lucas M.|last=Thomas|website=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=September 13, 2011|accessdate=September 3, 2015|title=Nintendo + Smartphones?

Switch would meet both cultures, and certain games, like ''[[1-2-Switch]]'', could potentially make social gaming more acceptable in Western culture.<ref name=\"time kimishima\"/> Two key elements that were set to address this mixed market were the ability for the unit to play both on a television screen and as a portable, and the use of detachable controllers.<ref name=\"glixel history\"/> The \"Switch\" name was selected not only to refer to the console's ability to switch from handheld to home console modes, but to present \"the idea of being a 'switch' that will flip and change the way

With the release of games like ''[[Wii Sports]]'' and ''[[Wii Fit]]'', players had asked Nintendo if they could make the Wii Remote in a smaller form factor, potentially strapped to a part of their body. This led to Nintendo envisioning what a smaller form-factor controller could provide in both hardware and gameplay, and led to the idea of a console that was small enough with these new controllers to also be portable.<ref>{{Cite web | url = https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/314530/The_Nintendo_Switch_JoyCons_and_even_Labo_are_the_result_of_Wiiera_feedback.php | title = The Nintendo Switch, Joy-Cons, and even Labo are the result of Wii-era feedback | first = Alissa | last= McAloon | date = February 9, 2018 | accessdate = February 9, 2018 | website = [[Gamasutra]] }}</ref> Other concepts came out of consumer feedback that was critical of the Wii U. Fils-Aim\u00e9 said that one common criticism they had for the Wii U was that while players did enjoy using the [[Wii U GamePad]] and would want to play games on it anywhere, it became functionless if they moved a distance away from the main console. This served for Nintendo to design a home console that the player could take with them anywhere.<ref>{{Cite web | url = https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/10/nintendo-president-our-future-is-as-an-entertainment-company/ | title = Nintendo president: \"I compete for time,\" not against Xbox, PlayStation | first = Sam | last= Mackovech  |date = October 3, 2018 | accessdate = October 8, 2018 | work = [[Ars Technica]] }}</ref> Around five different prototypes were developed for the Switch before they finalized on the released design. This included developing different methods of how the Joy-Con controllers would physically connect to the console, including using magnets to hold them in place.<ref name=\"glixel history\"/>\n\nIn addition to the form-factor design, Nintendo needed to balance the power and speed of the console's [[central processing unit]] with battery life and the unit's size, coupled with limited development resources and deadlines set by Nintendo's management. One choice made by the development team was to use an existing [[system on a chip]] (SOC) rather than creating their own as they had done on previous consoles. Koizumi said that this break from tradition was done to gain more third-party support for the console by using an SOC that developers could easily port to. Nintendo was not focused on raw processing power, but were instead looking to balance the overall features of the system, including battery life and size, as well as keeping in mind their limited development resources and timeline. Koizumi said \"The most difficult part was on how to take an overall balance while we were getting entangled with all of those in complexity.\"<ref name=\"glixel history\"/> To achieve this balance, they did not opt to use the more powerful hardware they could have used, instead using a middle-ground approach to achieve their vision of the Switch.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2017/02/28/the-switchs-architect-on-why-nintendos-consoles-are-different.aspx | title = The Switch's Architect On Why Nintendo's Consoles Are Different | first = Ben | last = Reeves | date = February 26, 2017 | accessdate = March 1, 2017 | website = [[Game Informer]] | url-status=live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170301082232/http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2017/02/28/the-switchs-architect-on-why-nintendos-consoles-are-different.aspx | archivedate = March 1, 2017 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nKoizumi served as the general producer of the Switch during development.<ref name=\"time feb2017\"/> According to Miyamoto, the Switch's development within Nintendo was headed by younger employees, with him saying \"it's really been them that have put this forward and designed this system\".<ref name=\"glixel miyamoto\">{{Cite web | url = http://www.glixel.com/news/nintendos-shigeru-miyamoto-didnt-lead-switch-development-w460944 | title = Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto Didn't Lead Switch Development | first = John | last = Davidson | date = January 12, 2017 | accessdate = January 12, 2017 | website = [[Glixel]] | url-status=live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170113170747/http://www.glixel.com/news/nintendos-shigeru-miyamoto-didnt-lead-switch-development-w460944 | archivedate = January 13, 2017 | df = mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"nytimes dec 2017\"/> Miyamoto said of the younger employees: \"I always look for designers who aren\u2019t super-passionate game fans.

Its wireless [[Joy-Con]] controllers, with standard buttons and directional analog sticks for user input, motion sensing, and tactile feedback, can attach to both sides of the console to support [[Handheld game console|handheld]]-style play. They can also connect to a Grip accessory to provide a traditional home console [[gamepad]] form, or be used individually in the hand like the [[Wii Remote|Wii Remote and Nunchuk]], supporting local multiplayer modes. The Nintendo Switch's software supports [[online game|online gaming]] through Internet connectivity, as well as local [[Wireless ad hoc network|wireless ad hoc]] connectivity with other consoles. Nintendo Switch games and software are available on both physical [[flash storage|flash]]-based [[Nintendo game card|ROM cartridges]] and [[digital distribution]] via [[Nintendo eShop]]; the system has no [[Regional lockout|region lockout]]. A handheld-focused revision of the system, called the [[Nintendo Switch Lite]], was released on September 20, 2019. \n\nThe Nintendo Switch was unveiled on October 20, 2016. Known in development by its codename '''NX''', the concept of the Switch came about as Nintendo's reaction to several quarters of financial losses into 2014, attributed to poor sales of its previous console, the [[Wii U]], and market competition from [[mobile gaming]]. Nintendo's then-president [[Satoru Iwata]] pushed the company towards mobile gaming and novel hardware. The Nintendo Switch's design is aimed at a wide demographic of video game players through the multiple modes of use. Nintendo opted to use more standard electronic components, such as a chipset based on [[Nvidia]]'s [[Tegra]] line, to make development for the console easier for programmers and more compatible with existing [[game engine]]s. As the Wii U had struggled to gain external support, leaving it with a weak software library, Nintendo preemptively sought the support of many [[Video game developer#Third-party developers|third-party developers and publishers]] to help build out the Switch's game library alongside Nintendo's own first-party titles, including many [[independent video game]] studios. While Nintendo initially anticipated around 100 titles for its first year, over 320 titles from first-party, third-party, and independent developers were released by the end of 2017.\n\nAs an [[Eighth generation of video game consoles|eighth-generation]] console, the Nintendo Switch competes with [[Microsoft]]'s [[Xbox One]] and [[Sony]]'s [[PlayStation 4]]. The console shipped nearly three million in the first month of its launch, exceeding Nintendo's initial projection of two million, and within a year of release achieved over 14 million units sold worldwide, outselling total lifetime sales of the Wii U. By the start of 2018, the Switch became the fastest-selling home console in both Japan and the United States. {{As of|2019|December}}, the Nintendo Switch and Switch Lite have sold more than 52 million units worldwide. Switch sales have been strongly tied to sales of Nintendo's first-party titles, with six games, ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild]]'', ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]'', ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]'', ''[[Mario Kart 8 Deluxe]]'', ''[[Pok\u00e9mon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!|Pok\u00e9mon: Let's Go]]'' and [[Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield|''Pok\u00e9mon Sword'' and ''Shield'']] having sold over ten million units each.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Background ===\nNintendo had seen record revenues, net sales and profits in 2009 as a result of the release of the [[Wii]] and [[Nintendo DS]] in 2006 and 2004 respectively,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/business/nintendo-defies-recession-with-record-profits-20090507-awdo.html|title=Nintendo defies recession with record profits|date=May 7, 2009|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=September 9, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2004/09/21/official-nintendo-ds-launch-details|title=Official Nintendo DS Launch Details|last=Harris|first=Craig|date=September 20, 2004|website=IGN|language=en-US|access-date=September 9, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"2009 Annual Financial\">{{Cite report|publisher=Nintendo|year=2009|accessdate=September 3, 2015|title=2009 Annual Financial Report: Financial Section|url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2009/annual0903e.pdf|page=17}}</ref> but in Nintendo's subsequent years, its revenues had declined.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://business.time.com/2014/01/17/nintendo-chief-we-failed/|title=Nintendo Chief: 'We Failed'|last=Nicks|first=Denver|date=January 17, 2014|work=Time|access-date=March 1, 2019|language=en|issn=0040-781X}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/3850264/nintendo-sales-wii-u-3ds-universal-studios/|title=Why Nintendo is Suddenly Profitable Again|last=Luckerson|first=Victor|date=May 7, 2015|website=Time|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=March 1, 2019}}</ref> The company had posted its first loss as a video game company in 2012 prior to the [[Wii U]]'s introduction that year, and had similar losses in the following years due to the console's poor uptake.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/25/technology/nintendos-wii-u-takes-aim-at-a-changed-video-game-world.html|title=Nintendo's Wii U Takes Aim at a Changed Video Game World|last=Wingfield|first=Nick|access-date=November 21, 2018|language=en}}</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]'' attributed Nintendo lowering financial forecasts in 2014 to weak hardware sales against [[mobile gaming]].<ref>{{Cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/18/technology/resisting-mobile-hurts-nintendos-bottom-line.html?_r=0 | title = Resisting Mobile Hurts Nintendo's Bottom Line | first = Nick | last = Wingfield | date = January 18, 2014 | accessdate = December 9, 2016 | website = [[New York Times]] | url-status=live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170728200642/https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/18/technology/resisting-mobile-hurts-nintendos-bottom-line.html?_r=0 | archivedate = July 28, 2017 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> Previously, the company had been hesitant about this market, with then-president [[Satoru Iwata]] considering that they would \"cease to be Nintendo\" and lose their identity if they attempted to enter it.<ref>{{Cite web|first=Lucas M.|last=Thomas|website=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=September 13, 2011|accessdate=September 3, 2015|title=Nintendo + Smartphones?

that are aimed to be played \"deeply\", according to Shinya Takahashi and [[Yoshiaki Koizumi]], general manager and deputy general manager of Nintendo's [[Nintendo Entertainment Planning &

With the release of games like ''[[Wii Sports]]'' and ''[[Wii Fit]]'', players had asked Nintendo if they could make the Wii Remote in a smaller form factor, potentially strapped to a part of their body. This led to Nintendo envisioning what a smaller form-factor controller could provide in both hardware and gameplay, and led to the idea of a console that was small enough with these new controllers to also be portable.<ref>{{Cite web | url = https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/314530/The_Nintendo_Switch_JoyCons_and_even_Labo_are_the_result_of_Wiiera_feedback.php | title = The Nintendo Switch, Joy-Cons, and even Labo are the result of Wii-era feedback | first = Alissa | last= McAloon | date = February 9, 2018 | accessdate = February 9, 2018 | website = [[Gamasutra]] }}</ref> Other concepts came out of consumer feedback that was critical of the Wii U. Fils-Aim\u00e9 said that one common criticism they had for the Wii U was that while players did enjoy using the [[Wii U GamePad]] and would want to play games on it anywhere, it became functionless if they moved a distance away from the main console. This served for Nintendo to design a home console that the player could take with them anywhere.<ref>{{Cite web | url = https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/10/nintendo-president-our-future-is-as-an-entertainment-company/ | title = Nintendo president: \"I compete for time,\" not against Xbox, PlayStation | first = Sam | last= Mackovech  |date = October 3, 2018 | accessdate = October 8, 2018 | work = [[Ars Technica]] }}</ref> Around five different prototypes were developed for the Switch before they finalized on the released design. This included developing different methods of how the Joy-Con controllers would physically connect to the console, including using magnets to hold them in place.<ref name=\"glixel history\"/>\n\nIn addition to the form-factor design, Nintendo needed to balance the power and speed of the console's [[central processing unit]] with battery life and the unit's size, coupled with limited development resources and deadlines set by Nintendo's management. One choice made by the development team was to use an existing [[system on a chip]] (SOC) rather than creating their own as they had done on previous consoles. Koizumi said that this break from tradition was done to gain more third-party support for the console by using an SOC that developers could easily port to. Nintendo was not focused on raw processing power, but were instead looking to balance the overall features of the system, including battery life and size, as well as keeping in mind their limited development resources and timeline. Koizumi said \"The most difficult part was on how to take an overall balance while we were getting entangled with all of those in complexity.\"<ref name=\"glixel history\"/> To achieve this balance, they did not opt to use the more powerful hardware they could have used, instead using a middle-ground approach to achieve their vision of the Switch.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2017/02/28/the-switchs-architect-on-why-nintendos-consoles-are-different.aspx | title = The Switch's Architect On Why Nintendo's Consoles Are Different | first = Ben | last = Reeves | date = February 26, 2017 | accessdate = March 1, 2017 | website = [[Game Informer]] | url-status=live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170301082232/http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2017/02/28/the-switchs-architect-on-why-nintendos-consoles-are-different.aspx | archivedate = March 1, 2017 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nKoizumi served as the general producer of the Switch during development.<ref name=\"time feb2017\"/> According to Miyamoto, the Switch's development within Nintendo was headed by younger employees, with him saying \"it's really been them that have put this forward and designed this system\".<ref name=\"glixel miyamoto\">{{Cite web | url = http://www.glixel.com/news/nintendos-shigeru-miyamoto-didnt-lead-switch-development-w460944 | title = Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto Didn't Lead Switch Development | first = John | last = Davidson | date = January 12, 2017 | accessdate = January 12, 2017 | website = [[Glixel]] | url-status=live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170113170747/http://www.glixel.com/news/nintendos-shigeru-miyamoto-didnt-lead-switch-development-w460944 | archivedate = January 13, 2017 | df = mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"nytimes dec 2017\"/> Miyamoto said of the younger employees: \"I always look for designers who aren\u2019t super-passionate game fans.

It was the first organization to submit a treaty which was adopted concerning women's rights\u2014the 1933 Convention on the Nationality of Women, which provided that marriage did not affect nationality. The women of the CIM submitted a resolution and attained the first international acknowledgement of women's political and civil rights (1938). They also researched and prepared the first-ever treaty on [[violence against women]] which was approved as the 1994 [[Bel\u00e9m do Par\u00e1 Convention]]. These firsts were based upon a strategy that has been followed by the women delegates of the CIM.

For example, at the time, upon marrying, a British woman would have lost her British citizenship had she married an Argentine, but as Argentina's law did not confer citizenship upon her for marriage, she became stateless. Stevens worked with [[Alice Paul]] of the [[National Woman's Party]] of the United States to review and prepare a report evaluating how women were effected by various laws. The women compiled a monumental report, which indexed all laws controlling women's nationality from every country in their native language and then translated each law on an accompanying page.<ref name=\"Lee (1929)\" />\n\nStevens spent three months in Europe meeting with women leaders and compiling information. She met with Dr. [[Luisa Baralt]] of Havana, Dr. [[Ellen Gleditsch]] of Oslo, [[Chrystal Macmillan]] and [[Sybil Thomas, Viscountess Rhondda]] of the UK, the [[Marquesa del Ter]] of Spain, [[Maria V\u00e9rone]] of France and [[H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Vacaresco]] of Romania, as well as various officers of the [[International Federation of University Women]] and others. She held public meetings to discuss the question of nationality in Geneva, London and Paris and attended a meeting at the Assembly of the [[League of Nations]] to obtain approval of a resolution for governments to attend a meeting discussing codification of laws and encouraged them to include women in their delegate selections. The resolution was submitted and passed unanimously.<ref name=\"Lee (1929), p 2\">\"Lee (1929)\", p 2</ref> In anticipation of a cooperative meeting between women in Europe and the Americas a conference was held at the Pan American Union to present the topic of women's nationality.<ref name=\"Lee (1929), p 3\">\"Lee (1929)\", p 3</ref>\n\nAs a result, the governing body of the Pan American Union created the Inter-American Commission of Women at their meeting in [[Havana]] on 4 April 1928. The provision called for a commission composed of seven women from the countries of the Americas and that those women should review data and prepare information to allow the Seventh Pan American Conference to consider women's civil and political equality in the region. It also called for expansion of the commission to eventually have one delegate for each country in the Pan American Union.<ref name=\"Lee (1929), p 3\" /> Stevens, who had suggested the commission was appointed as chair and the other six countries were selected by lot. The chosen countries were Argentina, Colombia, El Salvador, Haiti, Panama, and Venezuela and the appointed delegates were Dr. [[Ernestina A.

Voting rights were passed in El Salvador in 1939 and the Dominican Republic in 1942. The CIM delegates drafted multiple resolutions calling on the governments of the Americas to grant women suffrage and the 1943 meeting required delegates to work for both civil and political rights for women in their home countries instead of just observing and reporting on women's statuses. As further incentive, bulletins began to specifically mention delegates' activities, and what progress was being made.

It was the first organization to submit a treaty which was adopted concerning women's rights\u2014the 1933 Convention on the Nationality of Women, which provided that marriage did not affect nationality. The women of the CIM submitted a resolution and attained the first international acknowledgement of women's political and civil rights (1938). They also researched and prepared the first-ever treaty on [[violence against women]] which was approved as the 1994 [[Bel\u00e9m do Par\u00e1 Convention]]. These firsts were based upon a strategy that has been followed by the women delegates of the CIM.

For example, at the time, upon marrying, a British woman would have lost her British citizenship had she married an Argentine, but as Argentina's law did not confer citizenship upon her for marriage, she became stateless. Stevens worked with [[Alice Paul]] of the [[National Woman's Party]] of the United States to review and prepare a report evaluating how women were effected by various laws. The women compiled a monumental report, which indexed all laws controlling women's nationality from every country in their native language and then translated each law on an accompanying page.<ref name=\"Lee (1929)\" />\n\nStevens spent three months in Europe meeting with women leaders and compiling information. She met with Dr. [[Luisa Baralt]] of Havana, Dr. [[Ellen Gleditsch]] of Oslo, [[Chrystal Macmillan]] and [[Sybil Thomas, Viscountess Rhondda]] of the UK, the [[Marquesa del Ter]] of Spain, [[Maria V\u00e9rone]] of France and [[H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Vacaresco]] of Romania, as well as various officers of the [[International Federation of University Women]] and others. She held public meetings to discuss the question of nationality in Geneva, London and Paris and attended a meeting at the Assembly of the [[League of Nations]] to obtain approval of a resolution for governments to attend a meeting discussing codification of laws and encouraged them to include women in their delegate selections. The resolution was submitted and passed unanimously.<ref name=\"Lee (1929), p 2\">\"Lee (1929)\", p 2</ref> In anticipation of a cooperative meeting between women in Europe and the Americas a conference was held at the Pan American Union to present the topic of women's nationality.<ref name=\"Lee (1929), p 3\">\"Lee (1929)\", p 3</ref>\n\nAs a result, the governing body of the Pan American Union created the Inter-American Commission of Women at their meeting in [[Havana]] on 4 April 1928. The provision called for a commission composed of seven women from the countries of the Americas and that those women should review data and prepare information to allow the Seventh Pan American Conference to consider women's civil and political equality in the region. It also called for expansion of the commission to eventually have one delegate for each country in the Pan American Union.<ref name=\"Lee (1929), p 3\" /> Stevens, who had suggested the commission was appointed as chair and the other six countries were selected by lot. The chosen countries were Argentina, Colombia, El Salvador, Haiti, Panama, and Venezuela and the appointed delegates were Dr. [[Ernestina A.

Voting rights were passed in El Salvador in 1939 and the Dominican Republic in 1942. The CIM delegates drafted multiple resolutions calling on the governments of the Americas to grant women suffrage and the 1943 meeting required delegates to work for both civil and political rights for women in their home countries instead of just observing and reporting on women's statuses. As further incentive, bulletins began to specifically mention delegates' activities, and what progress was being made.
