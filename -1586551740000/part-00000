The program's name is a tribute to former Prime Minister and widow of President Zardari, [[Benazir Bhutto]], who was assassinated in 2007.{{Sfn|Shahzad 2011}}\n\nSince 2005, the purchasing power of many Pakistani families has been eroded by high inflation and the increasing cost of food and oil.  BISP arose against this backdrop as a means to address reductions in purchasing power.{{Sfn|Handayani-Burkley 2009}}  Along with the economic development aims of the program, BISP also seeks to empower women by presenting cash transfers directly to female members of households.{{Sfn|Benazir Income Support Programme}}\n\nBISP is currently the largest aid program in Pakistan and the government's third largest budgetary allocation.  BISP spending accounts for 0.3% of Pakistan's GDP.{{Sfn|Handayani-Burkley 2009}}\n\nIn the 2008\u20132009 fiscal year, more than 3 million Pakistani families received cash transfers through BISP; this figure accounts for 1.5% of the general population{{Sfn|Handayani-Burkley 2009}} and 10% of the population below the poverty level.  For the 2009\u20132010 fiscal year, the program was expanded to cover 5 million low-income families.{{Sfn|Handayani-Burkley 2009}}  At the program's start in 2008, the Pakistani government allocated RS 34&nbsp;billion, or $425&nbsp;million, for BISP; the allocation doubled to RS 70&nbsp;billion, or $875&nbsp;million in the following year.{{Sfn|Benazir Income Support Programme}}\n\nThe Benazir Income Support Programme is planning to launch a new initiative that encourages [[human capital]] development through a [[conditional cash transfer]].  The Waseela-e-Taleem initiative will condition cash payments on primary school enrolment for the children of eligible families.{{Sfn|Benazir Income Support Programme}} On 18 June 2017, BISP launched an e-commerce platform for its beneficiaries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/millennialpk/pakistans-new-plan-to-eradicate-poverty-use-embroidery-4a14b5cdfac0|title=Pakistan\u2019s New Plan to Eradicate Poverty: Use Embroidery|last=Wani|first=Shahrukh|date=2017-06-18|website=Medium|access-date=2017-06-24}}</ref>\n\n==Program structure==\nThe Benazir Income Support Programme has been implemented in the provinces of [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]], [[Sindh]], [[Baluchistan]], and [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Khyber-Pakhtonnkhwa]].  The program also operates in the federally administered regions of [[Azad Jammu and Kashmir]], and the Islamabad Capital Territory.{{Sfn|Benazir Income Support Programme}}\n\nIn its first year of operation, recipients of BISP cash transfers were identified and selected by Parliamentarians through a process of recommendation.  Each Parliamentarian received 8,000 forms to distribute throughout his or her constituency.  Selected individuals underwent an eligibility verification process through the National Database and Registration Authority.  A final list of eligible families was generated and sent to the postal service.  Funds were disbursed from the Treasury directly to the postal service and then delivered to the female head of eligible households.{{Sfn|Handayani-Burkley 2009}}\n\nIn April 2009, the process for identifying a selecting eligible families through Parliamentarian recommendation was ended.  The identification process has been reformed and now uses a Poverty Scorecard.  Through the Poverty Scorecard, families are identified through a proxy means test.{{Sfn|Benazir Income Support Programme}}  The Poverty Scorecard has been approved by the World Bank and requires families to answer 13 questions regarding assets and expenses in a survey.{{Sfn|Shahzad 2011}}  The poverty survey has been tested in 16 districts and will be distributed nationwide.{{Sfn|Benazir Income Support Programme}}\n\nInternal monitoring systems are being developed to track deliveries and payment amounts to eligible families.  Another mechanism to address corruption and political favouritism is being considered that would allow a neutral third party access to the list of eligible families to verify eligibility.{{Sfn|Handayani-Burkley 2009}}\n\nRecently, BISP has expanded to include several special initiatives.  The Waseela-e-Haq program empowers women through the provision of small loans.  A vocation training program, Waseela-e-Rozgar, offers members of eligible families up to 1 year of professional training.  The Waseela-e-Sehat program provides financial assistance specifically for obtaining basic health care.  BISP will launch its first program that conditions cash payments on schooling. The Waseela-e-Taleem initiative will require families receiving cash payments to enroll children between the ages of 5 to 12 to enroll in primary education.{{Sfn|Benazir Income Support Programme}}\n\nBISP also provides cash payments for emergency relief efforts.  These payments are similar to the payments received by low-income families but are distributed to families affected by terrorism, war, and natural disasters such as earthquakes.{{Sfn|Benazir Income Support Programme}}\n\n==Eligibility==\nTo be eligible for cash payments under BISP, families must earn less than RS 6,000 per month; equivalent to $67.{{Sfn|Handayani-Burkley 2009}}  Further eligibility requirements stipulate that:\n*Families must have a female applicant holding a valid ID card\n*An individual applicant must be a widowed or divorced female without male family members\n*Eligible families include those with physically or mentally disabled individuals\n\nFamilies deemed ineligible for cash payments through BISP include those with:{{Sfn|Handayani-Burkley 2009}}\n*Members employed by the Pakistani government, army, or any other government-affiliated agency\n*Members drawing a pension or receiving post-retirement benefits from the government\n*Family members owning more than 3 acres of farmland or more than 80 square yards of residential land\n*Members receiving income from other sources\n*Members holding a machine readable passport\n*Members with a National Identity Card for Overseas citizens\n*Members with a bank account excluding microfinance banks and those catering to low-inc\nome families\n\n==Benefits==\nEligible families receive cash payments of 4834 quarterly.  This amount increases the purchasing power for families earning approximately RS 5,000 each month by 20%.  Most low-income families spend 50\u201370% of total income on food alone.  According to BISP, the cash payment of RS 3,000 every two months, or RS 1,500 each month, will allow a family of 5\u20136 to purchase 20\u201325 days worth of flour.{{Sfn|Handayani-Burkley 2009}}\n\n==Criticism==\nSince the program's inception, critics have pointed out several overall flaws in the Benazir Income Support Program design.  Some claim that the amount of RS 3000 bi-monthly, or RS 1,500 per month, is not enough to move impoverished families above the poverty line as this would require RS 2,550 per month.  Another major flaw with BISP is its lack of conditionality.  Conditional cash transfer programs in Latin America have experienced greater degrees of success because recipient families must meet certain requirements before receiving a cash payment.{{Sfn|Shahzad 2011}}  These programs build human capital through requiring recipients to enroll their children in primary education, participate in health and nutrition seminars, and visit health care providers.{{Sfn|Rawlings-Rubio 2003}}  Apart from the Waseela-e-Taleem initiative, cash payments do not require recipients to meet particular obligations in return for cash payments.{{fact|date=October 2018}}\n \nThere have also been accusations of corruption and political favouritism.  By some estimates, only 50\u201360 percent of beneficiaries actually receive cash payments from BISP. The previous method of identifying families through the recommendation of Parliamentarians was flawed.  Many have claimed that Parliamentarians simply recommended their own family and friends to receive cash payments.{{Sfn|Shahzad 2011}}  It has been pointed out that there is a disproportionate number of families receiving BISP aid in geographic areas where the ruling Pakistan People's Party dominates.

The program's name is a tribute to former Prime Minister and widow of President Zardari, [[Benazir Bhutto]], who was assassinated in 2007.{{Sfn|Shahzad 2011}}\n\nSince 2005, the purchasing power of many Pakistani families has been eroded by high inflation and the increasing cost of food and oil.  BISP arose against this backdrop as a means to address reductions in purchasing power.{{Sfn|Handayani-Burkley 2009}}  Along with the economic development aims of the program, BISP also seeks to empower women by presenting cash transfers directly to female members of households.{{Sfn|Benazir Income Support Programme}}\n\nBISP is currently the largest aid program in Pakistan and the government's third largest budgetary allocation.  BISP spending accounts for 0.3% of Pakistan's GDP.{{Sfn|Handayani-Burkley 2009}}\n\nIn the 2008\u20132009 fiscal year, more than 3 million Pakistani families received cash transfers through BISP; this figure accounts for 1.5% of the general population{{Sfn|Handayani-Burkley 2009}} and 10% of the population below the poverty level.  For the 2009\u20132010 fiscal year, the program was expanded to cover 5 million low-income families.{{Sfn|Handayani-Burkley 2009}}  At the program's start in 2008, the Pakistani government allocated RS 34&nbsp;billion, or $425&nbsp;million, for BISP; the allocation doubled to RS 70&nbsp;billion, or $875&nbsp;million in the following year.{{Sfn|Benazir Income Support Programme}}\n\nThe Benazir Income Support Programme is planning to launch a new initiative that encourages [[human capital]] development through a [[conditional cash transfer]].  The Waseela-e-Taleem initiative will condition cash payments on primary school enrolment for the children of eligible families.{{Sfn|Benazir Income Support Programme}} On 18 June 2017, BISP launched an e-commerce platform for its beneficiaries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/millennialpk/pakistans-new-plan-to-eradicate-poverty-use-embroidery-4a14b5cdfac0|title=Pakistan\u2019s New Plan to Eradicate Poverty: Use Embroidery|last=Wani|first=Shahrukh|date=2017-06-18|website=Medium|access-date=2017-06-24}}</ref>\n\n==Program structure==\nThe Benazir Income Support Programme has been implemented in the provinces of [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]], [[Sindh]], [[Baluchistan]], and [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Khyber-Pakhtonnkhwa]].  The program also operates in the federally administered regions of [[Azad Jammu and Kashmir]], and the Islamabad Capital Territory.{{Sfn|Benazir Income Support Programme}}\n\nIn its first year of operation, recipients of BISP cash transfers were identified and selected by Parliamentarians through a process of recommendation.  Each Parliamentarian received 8,000 forms to distribute throughout his or her constituency.  Selected individuals underwent an eligibility verification process through the National Database and Registration Authority.  A final list of eligible families was generated and sent to the postal service.  Funds were disbursed from the Treasury directly to the postal service and then delivered to the female head of eligible households.{{Sfn|Handayani-Burkley 2009}}\n\nIn April 2009, the process for identifying a selecting eligible families through Parliamentarian recommendation was ended.  The identification process has been reformed and now uses a Poverty Scorecard.  Through the Poverty Scorecard, families are identified through a proxy means test.{{Sfn|Benazir Income Support Programme}}  The Poverty Scorecard has been approved by the World Bank and requires families to answer 13 questions regarding assets and expenses in a survey.{{Sfn|Shahzad 2011}}  The poverty survey has been tested in 16 districts and will be distributed nationwide.{{Sfn|Benazir Income Support Programme}}\n\nInternal monitoring systems are being developed to track deliveries and payment amounts to eligible families.  Another mechanism to address corruption and political favouritism is being considered that would allow a neutral third party access to the list of eligible families to verify eligibility.{{Sfn|Handayani-Burkley 2009}}\n\nRecently, BISP has expanded to include several special initiatives.  The Waseela-e-Haq program empowers women through the provision of small loans.  A vocation training program, Waseela-e-Rozgar, offers members of eligible families up to 1 year of professional training.  The Waseela-e-Sehat program provides financial assistance specifically for obtaining basic health care.  BISP will launch its first program that conditions cash payments on schooling. The Waseela-e-Taleem initiative will require families receiving cash payments to enroll children between the ages of 5 to 12 to enroll in primary education.{{Sfn|Benazir Income Support Programme}}\n\nBISP also provides cash payments for emergency relief efforts.  These payments are similar to the payments received by low-income families but are distributed to families affected by terrorism, war, and natural disasters such as earthquakes.{{Sfn|Benazir Income Support Programme}}\n\n==Eligibility==\nTo be eligible for cash payments under BISP, families must earn less than RS 6,000 per month; equivalent to $67.{{Sfn|Handayani-Burkley 2009}}  Further eligibility requirements stipulate that:\n*Families must have a female applicant holding a valid ID card\n*An individual applicant must be a widowed or divorced female without male family members\n*Eligible families include those with physically or mentally disabled individuals\n\nFamilies deemed ineligible for cash payments through BISP include those with:{{Sfn|Handayani-Burkley 2009}}\n*Members employed by the Pakistani government, army, or any other government-affiliated agency\n*Members drawing a pension or receiving post-retirement benefits from the government\n*Family members owning more than 3 acres of farmland or more than 80 square yards of residential land\n*Members receiving income from other sources\n*Members holding a machine readable passport\n*Members with a National Identity Card for Overseas citizens\n*Members with a bank account excluding microfinance banks and those catering to low-inc\nome families\n\n==Benefits==\nEligible families receive cash payments of 4834 quarterly.  This amount increases the purchasing power for families earning approximately RS 5,000 each month by 20%.  Most low-income families spend 50\u201370% of total income on food alone.  According to BISP, the cash payment of RS 3,000 every two months, or RS 1,500 each month, will allow a family of 5\u20136 to purchase 20\u201325 days worth of flour.{{Sfn|Handayani-Burkley 2009}}\n\n==Criticism==\nSince the program's inception, critics have pointed out several overall flaws in the Benazir Income Support Program design.  Some claim that the amount of RS 3000 bi-monthly, or RS 1,500 per month, is not enough to move impoverished families above the poverty line as this would require RS 2,550 per month.  Another major flaw with BISP is its lack of conditionality.  Conditional cash transfer programs in Latin America have experienced greater degrees of success because recipient families must meet certain requirements before receiving a cash payment.{{Sfn|Shahzad 2011}}  These programs build human capital through requiring recipients to enroll their children in primary education, participate in health and nutrition seminars, and visit health care providers.{{Sfn|Rawlings-Rubio 2003}}  Apart from the Waseela-e-Taleem initiative, cash payments do not require recipients to meet particular obligations in return for cash payments.{{fact|date=October 2018}}\n \nThere have also been accusations of corruption and political favouritism.  By some estimates, only 50\u201360 percent of beneficiaries actually receive cash payments from BISP. The previous method of identifying families through the recommendation of Parliamentarians was flawed.  Many have claimed that Parliamentarians simply recommended their own family and friends to receive cash payments.{{Sfn|Shahzad 2011}}  It has been pointed out that there is a disproportionate number of families receiving BISP aid in geographic areas where the ruling Pakistan People's Party dominates.  For example, in the Prime Minister's hometown of Multan, there is twice the number of people receiving BISP payments than in Lahore, the opposition party's stronghold.  Punjab, another area where opposition parties dominate, has the lowest ratio of eligible families\u20141,974 for every 100,000 people; versus 6,829 families for every 100,000 people in Sindh, the ruling party's stronghold.{{Sfn|Ghauri 2012}}  Beneficiaries have also complained that the postal service charges an additional RS 100 to RS 200 for each delivery of payment.{{Sfn|Shahzad 2011}}\n\nOther critics have argued that as the Benazir Income Support Programme makes up a substantial portion of the Pakistani government's budget, impact evaluations should be conducted to evaluate the benefits and actual need for the program.{{Sfn|Shahzad 2011}}\n\n==List of Chairpersons of Benazir Income Support Program==\n{| class=\"wikitable\n|-\n!align=center|Name of Chairperson\n!align=center|Entered Office\n!align=center|Left Office\n|-\n|[[Farzana Raja]]\n|July 2008\n|March 2013\n|-\n|Vacant\n|March 2013\n|November 2013\n|-\n|[[Enver Baig]]\n|November 2013\n|November 2014\n|-\n|Vacant\n|November 2014\n|February 2015\n|-\n|[[Marvi Memon]]\n|February 2015\n|June 2018\n|-\n|Vacant\n|June 2018\n|October 2018\n|-\n|[[Sania Nishtar]]\n|October 2018\n|Present\n|-\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n<!--- After listing your sources please cite them using inline citations and place them after the information they cite.

Many members of First Nations may have mixed ancestry but identify primarily by the tribal nation, rather than as M\u00e9tis.

No federal legislation defines the M\u00e9tis.\n\nAlberta is the only province to have defined the term in law under the ''M\u00e9tis Settlements Act'' (MSA), which defines a M\u00e9tis as \"a person of Aboriginal ancestry who identifies with M\u00e9tis history and culture\". This was done in the context of creating a test for legal eligibility for membership in one of Alberta's eight M\u00e9tis settlements. The MSA, together with requirements at the community level (Elder & community acceptance) create the legal requirements for residency on the M\u00e9tis Settlements. In Alberta law, belonging to a \"M\u00e9tis Association\" (M\u00e9tis National Council or any of its affiliates, M\u00e9tis Federation of Canada, Congress of Aboriginal People) does not grant one the rights granted to members of the Alberta M\u00e9tis Settlements. The MSA test excludes those people who are Status Indians (that is, a member of a First Nation), an exclusion which was upheld by the Supreme Court in ''Alberta v. Cunningham'' (2011).<ref name=\"Senate\"/>{{rp|10\u201311}}\n\nThe number of people self-identifying as M\u00e9tis has risen sharply since the late 20th century: between 1996 and 2006, the population of Canadians who self-identify as M\u00e9tis nearly doubled, to approximately 390,000.<ref name=\"Senate\"/>{{rp|2}} Until ''[[R v. Powley]]'' (2003), there was no legal definition of M\u00e9tis other than the legal requirements found in the ''M\u00e9tis Settlements Act'' of 1990.\n\nThe Powley case involved a claim by Steven Powley and his son Rodney, two members of the [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario]] M\u00e9tis community who were asserting M\u00e9tis hunting rights. The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] outlined three broad factors to identify M\u00e9tis who have Hunting Rights as Aboriginal peoples:<ref>(2003), 230 D.L.R. (4th) 1, 308 N.R. 201, 2003 SCC 43 [Powley]</ref>\n{{Quote|\n* self-identification as a M\u00e9tis individual;\n* ancestral connection to an historic M\u00e9tis community; and\n* acceptance by a M\u00e9tis community.}}\n\nAll three factors must be present for an individual to qualify under the SCC legal definition of M\u00e9tis. In addition, the court stated that\n{{quote|[t]he term M\u00e9tis in s. 35 does not encompass all individuals with mixed Indian and European heritage; rather, it refers to distinctive peoples who, in addition to their mixed ancestry, developed their own customs, ways of life, and recognizable group identity separate from their Indian or Inuit and European forebears.<ref name=\"Senate\"/>{{rp|9}} The court was explicit that its ten-point test is not a comprehensive definition of M\u00e9tis.}}\n\nQuestions remain as to whether M\u00e9tis have [[treaty rights]]; this is an explosive issue in the Canadian Aboriginal community today.

In many cases, as the fur traders lived with the native women at the location of their tribes, the children grew up in primarily First Nations societies.\n\nBut, as more M\u00e9tis lived in communities with a fur-trapping tradition, they created a new, distinct Aboriginal people in North America. First Nations women were the link between cultures; they provided companionship for the fur traders, introductions to their people and culture, and also aided in their survival. First Nations women were able to translate the native languages, sewed new clothing for their husbands and children, and generally were involved in resolving any cultural issues that arose. The First Peoples had survived in the west for thousands of years, so the fur traders benefited greatly from their First Nations wives' knowledge of the land and its resources. M\u00e9tis people were thought of as the familial bond between the Europeans and First Nations and Inuit peoples of North America. As adults, the men often worked as fur-trade company interpreters, as well as fur trappers in their turn.<ref name=\"mettis\"/> Many of the first generations of M\u00e9tis lived within the First Nations societies of their wives and children, but also started to marry M\u00e9tis women.\n\nAccording to historian Jacob A. Schooley, the M\u00e9tis developed over at least two generations and within different economic classes. In the first stage, \"servant\" (employee) traders of the fur trade companies, known as wintering partners, would stay for the season with First Nations bands, and make a \"country marriage\" with a high-status native woman. This woman and her children would move to live in the vicinity of a trading fort or post, becoming \"House Indians\" (as they were called by the company men). House Indians eventually formed distinct bands. Children raised within these \"House Indian\" bands often became employees of the companies. (Foster cites the legendary [[York boat]] captain Paulet Paul as an example). Eventually this second-generation group ended employment with the company and became commonly known as \"freemen\" traders and trappers. They lived with their families raising children in a distinct culture, accustomed to the fur-trade life, that valued free trading and the buffalo hunt in particular. He considered that the third generation, who were sometimes M\u00e9tis on both sides, were the first true M\u00e9tis. He suggests that in the [[Red River of the North|Red River]] region, many \"House Indians\" (and some non-\"House\" First Nations) were assimilated into M\u00e9tis culture due to the Catholic church's strong presence in that region. In the [[Fort Edmonton]] region however, many House Indians never adopted a M\u00e9tis identity but continued to identify primarily as Cree, Saulteaux, Ojibwa, and Chipweyan descendants up until the early 20th century.<ref name=\"foster\">\n{{cite journal |last1=Foster |first1=John E. |year=1985 |title=Paulet Paul: M\u00e9tis or \"House Indian\" Folk-Hero? |journal=Manitoba History |volume=9 |issue= |pages=Spring |publisher=Manitoba Historical Society |doi= |url=http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/mb_history/09/pauletpaul.shtml |accessdate=7 December 2012}}</ref><ref>Binnema, et al. \"John Elgin Foster\", ''From Rupert's Land to Canada: Essays in Honour of John E.

Often both sides felt such marriages were beneficial in strengthening the fur trade. Indigenous women often served as interpreters and could introduce their men to their people. Because many Native Americans and First Nations often had [[matrilineal]] [[kinship]] systems, the mixed-race children were considered born to the mother's clan and usually raised in her culture. Fewer were educated in European schools. M\u00e9tis men in the northern tier typically worked in the fur trade and later hunting and as guides. Over time in certain areas, particularly the [[Red River of the North]], the M\u00e9tis formed a distinct ethnic group with its own culture.\n\n=== History ===\nBetween 1795 and 1815 a network of M\u00e9tis settlements and trading posts was established throughout what is now the US states of [[Territory Northwest of the River Ohio|Michigan and Wisconsin, and to a lesser extent in Illinois and Indiana]].

After Michigan was admitted as a state and under pressure of increased European-American settlers from eastern states, many M\u00e9tis migrated westward into the [[Canadian Prairies]], including the [[Red River Colony]] and the [[Southbranch Settlement]]. Others identified with Chippewa groups, while many others were subsumed in an ethnic \"French\" identity, such as the [[Muskrat French]]. By the late 1830s only in the area of [[Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan|Sault Ste. Marie]] was there widespread recognition of the M\u00e9tis as a significant part of the community.<ref>Wallace Gesner, \"Habitants, Half-Breeds and Homeless Children: Transformations in Metis and Yankee-Yorker Relations in Early Michigan,\" in ''Michigan Historical Review'' Vol. 24, issue 1 (Jan. 1998) p. 23-47</ref>\n\nAnother major M\u00e9tis settlement was [[La Baye]], located at the present site of [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]].

The French in specific, viewed these marriages as sensible and realistic. Americans, however, viewed interracial marriages as unsound as the idea of racial purity was seen as the only option. Although it was legal, the result of these marriages generally resulted in the loss of status for the spouse of the highest social class, as well as for any children produced during the marriage. The French, however, seemed to motivate fur traders to participate in interracial marriages with Indian tribes as they helped to be beneficial to the fur trade business and also to spread religion. Generally speaking, these marriages were happy ones, that lasted and brought together differing groups of people and benefitted the fur trade business.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fredrickson|first=George M.|date=March 2005|title=Mulattoes and metis.

A strong Prairie M\u00e9tis identity exists in the \"homeland\" once known as [[Rupert's Land]], which extends south from Canada into [[North Dakota]], especially the land west of the Red River of the North. The historic Prairie M\u00e9tis homeland also includes parts of [[Minnesota]], and [[Wisconsin]]. A number of self-identified M\u00e9tis live in North Dakota, mostly in [[Pembina County, North Dakota|Pembina County]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = Pembina State Museum - History - State Historical Society of North Dakota|url = http://history.nd.gov/historicsites/pembina/pembinahistory4.html|website = history.nd.gov|accessdate = 2016-01-07}}</ref> Many members of the [[Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians]] (a federally recognized Tribe) identify as M\u00e9tis or Michif rather than as strictly [[Ojibwe]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Old White Rice \"The Great Chief\" \"Genesis of the Pembina/Turtle Mountain Chippewa\"|last=White Weasel|first=Charlie|publisher=Self published|year=1989|isbn=|edition=|location=Belcourt, North Dakota|pages=5}}</ref>\n\nMany M\u00e9tis families are recorded in the U.S. Census for the historic M\u00e9tis settlement areas along the Detroit and St. Clair rivers, [[Mackinac Island]], and [[Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan]], as well as Green Bay in [[Wisconsin]]. Their ancestral families were often formed in the early 19th-century fur trading era.\n\nThe M\u00e9tis have generally not organized as an ethnic or political group in the United States as they have in Canada, where they had armed confrontations in an effort to secure a homeland.\n\nThe first \"Conference on the M\u00e9tis in North America\" was held in Chicago in 1981,<ref name=\"douad\">[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1183704 Peter C. Douaud, \"Reviewed Work: 'The New Peoples: Being and Becoming M\u00e9tis in North America' by Jacqueline Peterson, Jennifer S. H.

This also was a period of increased appreciation for different ethnic groups and reappraisal of the histories of settlement of North America. Papers at the conference focused on \"becoming M\u00e9tis\" and the role of history in formation of this ethnic group, defined in Canada as having Aboriginal status. The people and their history continue to be extensively studied, especially by scholars in Canada and the United States.\n\n===Louis Riel and the United States ===\n[[Louis Riel]] had a significant impact on the M\u00e9tis community in Canada, especially in the Manitoba region. However he did also have a distinct relationship with the M\u00e9tis in the Unites States and was in fact at the time of his execution an American citizen.<ref name=\"Bumsted\">{{Cite journal|last=Bumsted|first=J. M.|date=March 1999|title=Louis Riel and the United States|journal=American Review of Canadian Studies|volume=29|issue=1|pages=17\u201341|doi=10.1080/02722019909481620|issn=0272-2011}}</ref> Riel attempted to be a leader for the M\u00e9tis community in the Unites States and  contributed immensely in the defence of the M\u00e9tis rights, especially those who occupied the Red River region throughout his life.\n\nOn October 22, 1844 Louis Riel was born in the Red River settlement known as the territory of [[Assiniboia]].<ref name=\"Bumsted\" /> He was born with British background however as the M\u00e9tis are a mobile community he travelled a lot and had a transitional identity, meaning he would often cross the Canada and United States border. During the 19th century there were few American born citizens living in Red River altogether.\n\nRiel greatly contributed to the defense of M\u00e9tis justice, more specifically on November 22, 1869 Riel arrived in Winnipeg to discuss with McDougall the rights of the M\u00e9tis community. At the end of the settlement McDougall&nbsp;agreed to guarantee a \u201cList of Rights\u201d .<ref name=\"Bumsted\" /> That statement  also incorporated four clauses of the Dakota bill of rights. This Bill of rights was the rise of the American M\u00e9tis influence during the Red River M\u00e9tis revolution and was an important milestone in M\u00e9tis justice.\n\nThe following years was a constant battle between the government in charge and the M\u00e9tis people that furthermore created conflict involving citizenship of M\u00e9tis leaders, such as Louis Riel who was crossing the border without proper notice. This caused repercussions for Riel who was now wanted by the Ontario government. He was later accused for the Scott Death, a murder case who was decided without a proper trial and by 1874 there was a warrant out for his arrest in Winnipeg.<ref name=\"Bumsted\" /> Because of the warrant accusations in Canada, Riel saw the United States as a safer territory for himself and the M\u00e9tis people. The following years lead to Riel running from the Canadian government because of the murder convictions and this is when he spent most of his time in the United State. Riel struggled with mental health problems and decided in the following years that it was time to receive proper treatment in the American northeast from 1875- 1868.  Once better decided to change his life by obtaining an American residence and decided to complete the journey of the liberation of the M\u00e9tis people that he first started in 1869. With the help of the United States military, Riel wanted to invade Manitoba to obtain control. However, because of the lack of desire to cause conflict with the Canadian military the American military rejected his proposition. He then tried to create an international alliance between the Aboriginal and Metis people, which wasn't a success either. In the end his main objective was to simply improve the living conditions and rights of the M\u00e9tis people in the United States. The failed attempts for Riel to defend the M\u00e9tis community lead to further mental breakdowns and hospitalization, now in Quebec.<ref name=\"Bumsted\" />\n\nRiel returned to Montana from 1879 to continue on his mission to defend the M\u00e9tis community in the United States. Riel wanted the M\u00e9tis and the Native people of the region to join forces and create a political movement against the provisional government. Both parties denied this profound movement and after yet another failed attempt to create a revolution he decided to officially become an American citizen and declared \u201cThe United States sheltered me, The English didn\u2019t care/what they owe they will pay/! I am citizen\u201d.<ref name=\"Bumsted\" /> He then spent the next four years improving the conditions of the Montana M\u00e9tis in any way he could.\n\nRiel stayed in the United States from 1880-1884 fighting to obtain official residency from the American government but without success he finally departed for Saskatchewan in 1884.  Riel concentrated his public life on improving the situation of the [[:Category:M\u00e9tis in Montana|Montana Metis]] and had a big impact on the M\u00e9tis people in the United States by attempting to address their rights and improve overall living conditions. The following years was a constant battle to obtain official citizenship from the American government. In the end, an American citizenship did not permit the protection from Canadian convictions. The American officials did not confirm his American citizenship because of fear of further conflict with the Canadian government and confirmed Riel's execution for treason in 1885.<ref name=\"Bumsted\" />\n\n== The Medicine Line (Canada\u2013U.S. Border) ==\nThe M\u00e9tis homeland existed before the implementation of the Canada\u2013U.S. border and continues to exist on both sides of this border today. The implementation of the border affected the M\u00e9tis in a multitude of ways, with border enforcement growing from relaxed to increasingly stronger over time.<ref name=\"Hogue\">{{Cite journal|last=Hogue|first=Michel|date=Winter 2002|title=Disputing the Medicine Line: The Plains Crees and the Canadian-American Border, 1876- 1885|journal=Montana: The Magazine of Western History|volume=52, 4|issue=4|pages=2\u201317|jstor=4520462}}</ref> In the late 18th century, to early 19th century the M\u00e9tis found that in times of conflict, they could cross the [[49th parallel north|49th parallel North]] in either direction and the trouble following them would stop, and so the border was known as the Medicine Line. This began to change toward the end of the 19th century when the border became more enforced, and the Canadian government saw an opportunity to put an end to the line hopping by using military force.<ref name=\"Hogue\" /> This effectively split some of the M\u00e9tis population, and restricted the mobility of the People. The enforcement of the border was used as a means for governments on either side of the Medicine Line in the grand prairies to control the M\u00e9tis population and to restrict their access to [[Bison hunting|buffalo]].<ref name=\"Hogue\" /> Because of the importance of [[kinship]] and mobility for M\u00e9tis communities,<ref name=\":1\" /> this had negative implications and resulted in different experiences and hardships for both groups.\n\nM\u00e9tis experience in the U.S. is largely coloured by unratified [[Treaty|treaties]] and the lack of federal representation of M\u00e9tis communities as a legitimate people, and this can be seen in the case of the Little Shell Tribe in Montana.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Vrooman|first=Nicholas C.

This was done in the context of creating a test for legal eligibility for membership in one of Alberta's eight M\u00e9tis settlements. The MSA, together with requirements at the community level (Elder & community acceptance) create the legal requirements for residency on the M\u00e9tis Settlements. In Alberta law, belonging to a \"M\u00e9tis Association\" (M\u00e9tis National Council or any of its affiliates, M\u00e9tis Federation of Canada, Congress of Aboriginal People) does not grant one the rights granted to members of the Alberta M\u00e9tis Settlements.

The CAP, which has nine regional affiliates, represents all Aboriginal people who are not part of the reserve system, including M\u00e9tis and [[non-Status Indians]]. It does not define M\u00e9tis and uses a broad conception based on self-identification.\n\nThe M\u00e9tis National Council broke away from the Native Council of Canada, CAP's predecessor, in 1983. Its political leadership of the time stated that the NCC's \"pan-Aboriginal approach to issues did not allow the M\u00e9tis Nation to effectively represent itself\".<ref name=\"Senate\"/>{{rp|11}} The MNC views the M\u00e9tis as a single nation with a common history and culture centred on the fur trade of \"west-central North America\" in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.

In many cases, as the fur traders lived with the native women at the location of their tribes, the children grew up in primarily First Nations societies.\n\nBut, as more M\u00e9tis lived in communities with a fur-trapping tradition, they created a new, distinct Aboriginal people in North America. First Nations women were the link between cultures; they provided companionship for the fur traders, introductions to their people and culture, and also aided in their survival. First Nations women were able to translate the native languages, sewed new clothing for their husbands and children, and generally were involved in resolving any cultural issues that arose. The First Peoples had survived in the west for thousands of years, so the fur traders benefited greatly from their First Nations wives' knowledge of the land and its resources. M\u00e9tis people were thought of as the familial bond between the Europeans and First Nations and Inuit peoples of North America. As adults, the men often worked as fur-trade company interpreters, as well as fur trappers in their turn.<ref name=\"mettis\"/> Many of the first generations of M\u00e9tis lived within the First Nations societies of their wives and children, but also started to marry M\u00e9tis women.\n\nAccording to historian Jacob A. Schooley, the M\u00e9tis developed over at least two generations and within different economic classes. In the first stage, \"servant\" (employee) traders of the fur trade companies, known as wintering partners, would stay for the season with First Nations bands, and make a \"country marriage\" with a high-status native woman. This woman and her children would move to live in the vicinity of a trading fort or post, becoming \"House Indians\" (as they were called by the company men). House Indians eventually formed distinct bands. Children raised within these \"House Indian\" bands often became employees of the companies. (Foster cites the legendary [[York boat]] captain Paulet Paul as an example). Eventually this second-generation group ended employment with the company and became commonly known as \"freemen\" traders and trappers. They lived with their families raising children in a distinct culture, accustomed to the fur-trade life, that valued free trading and the buffalo hunt in particular. He considered that the third generation, who were sometimes M\u00e9tis on both sides, were the first true M\u00e9tis. He suggests that in the [[Red River of the North|Red River]] region, many \"House Indians\" (and some non-\"House\" First Nations) were assimilated into M\u00e9tis culture due to the Catholic church's strong presence in that region. In the [[Fort Edmonton]] region however, many House Indians never adopted a M\u00e9tis identity but continued to identify primarily as Cree, Saulteaux, Ojibwa, and Chipweyan descendants up until the early 20th century.<ref name=\"foster\">\n{{cite journal |last1=Foster |first1=John E. |year=1985 |title=Paulet Paul: M\u00e9tis or \"House Indian\" Folk-Hero? |journal=Manitoba History |volume=9 |issue= |pages=Spring |publisher=Manitoba Historical Society |doi= |url=http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/mb_history/09/pauletpaul.shtml |accessdate=7 December 2012}}</ref><ref>Binnema, et al. \"John Elgin Foster\", ''From Rupert's Land to Canada: Essays in Honour of John E.

(This legislation followed legal suits filed by the M\u00e9tis Settlements against the Crown in the 1970\u2019s).\n\nThe M\u00e9tis Settlements consist of predominantly Indigenous M\u00e9tis populations native to Northern Alberta \u2013 unique from those of the Red River, the Great Lakes, and other migrant M\u00e9tis from further east. However, following the Riel and Dumont resistances some Red-River M\u00e9tis fled westward, where they married into the contemporary M\u00e9tis settlement populations during the end of the 19th century and into the early 20th century. Historically referred to as the \"Nomadic Half-breeds\", the M\u00e9tis of [[Northern Alberta]] have a unique history. Their fight for land is still evident today with the eight contemporary M\u00e9tis settlements.\n\nFollowing the formal establishment of the M\u00e9tis settlements, then called Half-Breed Colonies, in the 1930s by a distinct M\u00e9tis political organization, the M\u00e9tis populations in Northern Alberta were the only M\u00e9tis to secure communal M\u00e9tis lands. During renewed Indigenous activism during the 1960s into the 1970s, political organizations were formed or revived among the M\u00e9tis. In [[M\u00e9tis in Alberta|Alberta, the M\u00e9tis settlements]] united as: The \"Alberta Federation of M\u00e9tis Settlement Associations\" in the mid-1970s. Today, the Federation is represented by the M\u00e9tis Settlements General Council.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://metissettlements.com/updates/|title=M\u00e9tis Settlements General Council|accessdate=15 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803051901/https://metissettlements.com/updates/|archive-date=2017-08-03|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nDuring the constitutional talks of 1982, the M\u00e9tis were recognized as one of the three Aboriginal peoples of Canada, in part by the Federation of M\u00e9tis Settlements.

Often both sides felt such marriages were beneficial in strengthening the fur trade. Indigenous women often served as interpreters and could introduce their men to their people. Because many Native Americans and First Nations often had [[matrilineal]] [[kinship]] systems, the mixed-race children were considered born to the mother's clan and usually raised in her culture. Fewer were educated in European schools. M\u00e9tis men in the northern tier typically worked in the fur trade and later hunting and as guides. Over time in certain areas, particularly the [[Red River of the North]], the M\u00e9tis formed a distinct ethnic group with its own culture.\n\n=== History ===\nBetween 1795 and 1815 a network of M\u00e9tis settlements and trading posts was established throughout what is now the US states of [[Territory Northwest of the River Ohio|Michigan and Wisconsin, and to a lesser extent in Illinois and Indiana]].

The French in specific, viewed these marriages as sensible and realistic. Americans, however, viewed interracial marriages as unsound as the idea of racial purity was seen as the only option. Although it was legal, the result of these marriages generally resulted in the loss of status for the spouse of the highest social class, as well as for any children produced during the marriage. The French, however, seemed to motivate fur traders to participate in interracial marriages with Indian tribes as they helped to be beneficial to the fur trade business and also to spread religion. Generally speaking, these marriages were happy ones, that lasted and brought together differing groups of people and benefitted the fur trade business.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fredrickson|first=George M.|date=March 2005|title=Mulattoes and metis.

A strong Prairie M\u00e9tis identity exists in the \"homeland\" once known as [[Rupert's Land]], which extends south from Canada into [[North Dakota]], especially the land west of the Red River of the North. The historic Prairie M\u00e9tis homeland also includes parts of [[Minnesota]], and [[Wisconsin]].

Marie, Michigan]], as well as Green Bay in [[Wisconsin]]. Their ancestral families were often formed in the early 19th-century fur trading era.\n\nThe M\u00e9tis have generally not organized as an ethnic or political group in the United States as they have in Canada, where they had armed confrontations in an effort to secure a homeland.\n\nThe first \"Conference on the M\u00e9tis in North America\" was held in Chicago in 1981,<ref name=\"douad\">[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1183704 Peter C.

This also was a period of increased appreciation for different ethnic groups and reappraisal of the histories of settlement of North America. Papers at the conference focused on \"becoming M\u00e9tis\" and the role of history in formation of this ethnic group, defined in Canada as having Aboriginal status. The people and their history continue to be extensively studied, especially by scholars in Canada and the United States.\n\n===Louis Riel and the United States ===\n[[Louis Riel]] had a significant impact on the M\u00e9tis community in Canada, especially in the Manitoba region. However he did also have a distinct relationship with the M\u00e9tis in the Unites States and was in fact at the time of his execution an American citizen.<ref name=\"Bumsted\">{{Cite journal|last=Bumsted|first=J. M.|date=March 1999|title=Louis Riel and the United States|journal=American Review of Canadian Studies|volume=29|issue=1|pages=17\u201341|doi=10.1080/02722019909481620|issn=0272-2011}}</ref> Riel attempted to be a leader for the M\u00e9tis community in the Unites States and  contributed immensely in the defence of the M\u00e9tis rights, especially those who occupied the Red River region throughout his life.\n\nOn October 22, 1844 Louis Riel was born in the Red River settlement known as the territory of [[Assiniboia]].<ref name=\"Bumsted\" /> He was born with British background however as the M\u00e9tis are a mobile community he travelled a lot and had a transitional identity, meaning he would often cross the Canada and United States border. During the 19th century there were few American born citizens living in Red River altogether.\n\nRiel greatly contributed to the defense of M\u00e9tis justice, more specifically on November 22, 1869 Riel arrived in Winnipeg to discuss with McDougall the rights of the M\u00e9tis community. At the end of the settlement McDougall&nbsp;agreed to guarantee a \u201cList of Rights\u201d .<ref name=\"Bumsted\" /> That statement  also incorporated four clauses of the Dakota bill of rights. This Bill of rights was the rise of the American M\u00e9tis influence during the Red River M\u00e9tis revolution and was an important milestone in M\u00e9tis justice.\n\nThe following years was a constant battle between the government in charge and the M\u00e9tis people that furthermore created conflict involving citizenship of M\u00e9tis leaders, such as Louis Riel who was crossing the border without proper notice. This caused repercussions for Riel who was now wanted by the Ontario government. He was later accused for the Scott Death, a murder case who was decided without a proper trial and by 1874 there was a warrant out for his arrest in Winnipeg.<ref name=\"Bumsted\" /> Because of the warrant accusations in Canada, Riel saw the United States as a safer territory for himself and the M\u00e9tis people. The following years lead to Riel running from the Canadian government because of the murder convictions and this is when he spent most of his time in the United State. Riel struggled with mental health problems and decided in the following years that it was time to receive proper treatment in the American northeast from 1875- 1868.  Once better decided to change his life by obtaining an American residence and decided to complete the journey of the liberation of the M\u00e9tis people that he first started in 1869. With the help of the United States military, Riel wanted to invade Manitoba to obtain control. However, because of the lack of desire to cause conflict with the Canadian military the American military rejected his proposition. He then tried to create an international alliance between the Aboriginal and Metis people, which wasn't a success either. In the end his main objective was to simply improve the living conditions and rights of the M\u00e9tis people in the United States. The failed attempts for Riel to defend the M\u00e9tis community lead to further mental breakdowns and hospitalization, now in Quebec.<ref name=\"Bumsted\" />\n\nRiel returned to Montana from 1879 to continue on his mission to defend the M\u00e9tis community in the United States. Riel wanted the M\u00e9tis and the Native people of the region to join forces and create a political movement against the provisional government. Both parties denied this profound movement and after yet another failed attempt to create a revolution he decided to officially become an American citizen and declared \u201cThe United States sheltered me, The English didn\u2019t care/what they owe they will pay/! I am citizen\u201d.<ref name=\"Bumsted\" /> He then spent the next four years improving the conditions of the Montana M\u00e9tis in any way he could.\n\nRiel stayed in the United States from 1880-1884 fighting to obtain official residency from the American government but without success he finally departed for Saskatchewan in 1884.  Riel concentrated his public life on improving the situation of the [[:Category:M\u00e9tis in Montana|Montana Metis]] and had a big impact on the M\u00e9tis people in the United States by attempting to address their rights and improve overall living conditions. The following years was a constant battle to obtain official citizenship from the American government. In the end, an American citizenship did not permit the protection from Canadian convictions. The American officials did not confirm his American citizenship because of fear of further conflict with the Canadian government and confirmed Riel's execution for treason in 1885.<ref name=\"Bumsted\" />\n\n== The Medicine Line (Canada\u2013U.S. Border) ==\nThe M\u00e9tis homeland existed before the implementation of the Canada\u2013U.S. border and continues to exist on both sides of this border today. The implementation of the border affected the M\u00e9tis in a multitude of ways, with border enforcement growing from relaxed to increasingly stronger over time.<ref name=\"Hogue\">{{Cite journal|last=Hogue|first=Michel|date=Winter 2002|title=Disputing the Medicine Line: The Plains Crees and the Canadian-American Border, 1876- 1885|journal=Montana: The Magazine of Western History|volume=52, 4|issue=4|pages=2\u201317|jstor=4520462}}</ref> In the late 18th century, to early 19th century the M\u00e9tis found that in times of conflict, they could cross the [[49th parallel north|49th parallel North]] in either direction and the trouble following them would stop, and so the border was known as the Medicine Line. This began to change toward the end of the 19th century when the border became more enforced, and the Canadian government saw an opportunity to put an end to the line hopping by using military force.<ref name=\"Hogue\" /> This effectively split some of the M\u00e9tis population, and restricted the mobility of the People. The enforcement of the border was used as a means for governments on either side of the Medicine Line in the grand prairies to control the M\u00e9tis population and to restrict their access to [[Bison hunting|buffalo]].<ref name=\"Hogue\" /> Because of the importance of [[kinship]] and mobility for M\u00e9tis communities,<ref name=\":1\" /> this had negative implications and resulted in different experiences and hardships for both groups.\n\nM\u00e9tis experience in the U.S. is largely coloured by unratified [[Treaty|treaties]] and the lack of federal representation of M\u00e9tis communities as a legitimate people, and this can be seen in the case of the Little Shell Tribe in Montana.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Vrooman|first=Nicholas C.

The area also has its fair share of scientific museums, such as [[SciWorks]], the [[International Civil Rights Center and Museum]], the [[Wake Forest Museum of Anthropology]], and the [[Greensboro Science Center]]. The [[North Carolina Zoo]], the world's largest open-air natural habitat zoo, is located just outside the Randoph County city of [[Asheboro]].\n\n== Economy ==\nThe economy in the Piedmont Triad is a mixed economy.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n=== Industry and manufacturing ===\nThe Triad area is notable for large [[textile]], [[tobacco]], and [[furniture]] corporations. The Triad remains a national center for textile manufacturing, represented by corporations including [[Hanes]] based in [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina|Winston-Salem]], and [[International Textile Group]], based in [[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro]]. Tobacco remains a prominent crop in the Triad's rural areas and many tobacco companies like [[Lorillard Tobacco Company]] of [[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro]], and [[Reynolds American]], based in [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina|Winston-Salem]], call the Piedmont Triad home.  Numerous furniture manufacturers are also headquartered in the Triad area, especially in the cities of [[High Point, North Carolina|High Point]] (deemed the \"Furniture Capital of the World\"), [[Thomasville, North Carolina|Thomasville]] (known as the \"Chair City\"), and [[Lexington, North Carolina|Lexington]]. The furniture and textile industries have in turn spawned large trucking, logistics, and warehousing businesses in the area.  Popular brands like \"Thomasville\" and \"Lexington\" are derived from the names of these cities. Recently, however, many furniture and tobacco factories have been closing and/or [[laid off|laying off]] workers across the region in response to escalating industrial globalization.\n\n=== Technology and biotechnology ===\nAfter many of the old industries in the area began to die out, many Piedmont Triad cities began encouraging technological businesses to move into the Triad. [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina|Winston-Salem]], for instance, founded within its downtown the [[Piedmont Triad Research Park]], now known as [[Wake Forest Innovation Quarter]], a highly interactive, 200-acre, master-planned innovation community developed to support [[life science]] and [[information technology]] [[research]] and development. [[Dell, Inc.]] in the early 2000s struck a deal with local officials allowing for the construction of a new computer assembly plant near the Triad city of [[Kernersville, North Carolina|Kernersville]]. Dell pulled out of its contract with the city, however, and left after only a few years.  Additionally, [[the University of North Carolina at Greensboro]], the largest institution of higher learning in the region, and [[North Carolina A&T State University]] have joined forces to establish the Gateway University Research Park, a technology-based entity that will focus its efforts on a host of biological, life, and environmental science research projects.  Upon full build out of the project, it is expected to be housed by two {{convert|75|acre|m2|adj=on}} campuses, employ approximately 2,000 people, and generate $50 million per year to the Triad economy. [[LabCorp]], one of the largest clinical laboratories in the world, has its corporate headquarters and several of its testing facilities in [[Burlington, North Carolina|Burlington]].\n\n=== Shopping ===\nThe following are the most prominent regional shopping centers/malls in the Piedmont Triad region:\n* [[Four Seasons Town Centre]], Greensboro\n* [[Friendly Center]], Greensboro\n* [[Hanes Mall]], Winston-Salem\n* [[Alamance Crossing]], Burlington\n* [[Burlington Outlet Village]], Burlington\n* [[Holly Hill Mall]], Burlington\n* [[Tanger Outlets]], Mebane\n* [[Marketplace Mall (Winston-Salem)|Marketplace Mall]], Winston-Salem\n* [[Randolph Mall]], Asheboro\n\n== Transportation ==\n[[File:piedmonttriadfreewaymap.png|thumbnail|370px|right|Major roads and cities in the Piedmont Triad and two other nearby counties. The blue triangle represents the three points of the \"Triad\".]]\n\n=== Primary highways ===\n{{details|North Carolina Highway System}}\nThe Triad is home to an extensive [[freeway]] network, which is in the process of undergoing a major expansion. Four major [[Interstate highway]]s and numerous secondary Interstate routes and [[United States Numbered Highways|US routes]] serve the region:\n;Interstate highways\n*[[File:I-40.svg|20px]] [[Interstate 40 in North Carolina|I-40]], the primary east-west route across the region. In the eastern Triad, it is conjoined with I-85.  The two routes split in Greensboro.\n**[[File:I-840.svg|25px]] [[Greensboro Urban Loop|I-840]] (Painter Boulevard), part of the Greensboro Urban Loop, currently under construction.  When complete, I-840 will form the northern half of the loop.\n*[[File:I-73.svg|20px]] [[Interstate 73|I-73]], the primary north-south route across the region, much of which has yet to be constructed.  The route follows the current [[United States Route 220|US 220]], with the exception of a small segment that shares the southwestern portion of the Greensboro Outer Loop, and was briefly designated as [[I-40]] between its opening in February, 2008.  This portion was originally designated as [[I-40]], with the current and original [[I-40]] being re-designated as Business 40.\n*[[File:I-74.svg|20px]] [[Interstate 74 in North Carolina|I-74]], running across the region from southeast to northwest.  Like I-73, much of the route has yet to be constructed, but several disjointed segments are currently open and signed as either I-74 or \"FUTURE I-74\".  The route enters the region from the south conjoined with I-73, and diverges from there north of Asheboro toward High Point.  The southern segment presently terminates at an intersection with I-40 east of Winston-Salem; new freeway is being built that will form the eastern segment of the [[Winston-Salem Beltway]].

The area also has its fair share of scientific museums, such as [[SciWorks]], the [[International Civil Rights Center and Museum]], the [[Wake Forest Museum of Anthropology]], and the [[Greensboro Science Center]]. The [[North Carolina Zoo]], the world's largest open-air natural habitat zoo, is located just outside the Randoph County city of [[Asheboro]].\n\n== Economy ==\nThe economy in the Piedmont Triad is a mixed economy.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n=== Industry and manufacturing ===\nThe Triad area is notable for large [[textile]], [[tobacco]], and [[furniture]] corporations. The Triad remains a national center for textile manufacturing, represented by corporations including [[Hanes]] based in [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina|Winston-Salem]], and [[International Textile Group]], based in [[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro]]. Tobacco remains a prominent crop in the Triad's rural areas and many tobacco companies like [[Lorillard Tobacco Company]] of [[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro]], and [[Reynolds American]], based in [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina|Winston-Salem]], call the Piedmont Triad home.  Numerous furniture manufacturers are also headquartered in the Triad area, especially in the cities of [[High Point, North Carolina|High Point]] (deemed the \"Furniture Capital of the World\"), [[Thomasville, North Carolina|Thomasville]] (known as the \"Chair City\"), and [[Lexington, North Carolina|Lexington]]. The furniture and textile industries have in turn spawned large trucking, logistics, and warehousing businesses in the area.  Popular brands like \"Thomasville\" and \"Lexington\" are derived from the names of these cities. Recently, however, many furniture and tobacco factories have been closing and/or [[laid off|laying off]] workers across the region in response to escalating industrial globalization.\n\n=== Technology and biotechnology ===\nAfter many of the old industries in the area began to die out, many Piedmont Triad cities began encouraging technological businesses to move into the Triad. [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina|Winston-Salem]], for instance, founded within its downtown the [[Piedmont Triad Research Park]], now known as [[Wake Forest Innovation Quarter]], a highly interactive, 200-acre, master-planned innovation community developed to support [[life science]] and [[information technology]] [[research]] and development. [[Dell, Inc.]] in the early 2000s struck a deal with local officials allowing for the construction of a new computer assembly plant near the Triad city of [[Kernersville, North Carolina|Kernersville]]. Dell pulled out of its contract with the city, however, and left after only a few years.  Additionally, [[the University of North Carolina at Greensboro]], the largest institution of higher learning in the region, and [[North Carolina A&T State University]] have joined forces to establish the Gateway University Research Park, a technology-based entity that will focus its efforts on a host of biological, life, and environmental science research projects.  Upon full build out of the project, it is expected to be housed by two {{convert|75|acre|m2|adj=on}} campuses, employ approximately 2,000 people, and generate $50 million per year to the Triad economy. [[LabCorp]], one of the largest clinical laboratories in the world, has its corporate headquarters and several of its testing facilities in [[Burlington, North Carolina|Burlington]].\n\n=== Shopping ===\nThe following are the most prominent regional shopping centers/malls in the Piedmont Triad region:\n* [[Four Seasons Town Centre]], Greensboro\n* [[Friendly Center]], Greensboro\n* [[Hanes Mall]], Winston-Salem\n* [[Alamance Crossing]], Burlington\n* [[Burlington Outlet Village]], Burlington\n* [[Holly Hill Mall]], Burlington\n* [[Tanger Outlets]], Mebane\n* [[Marketplace Mall (Winston-Salem)|Marketplace Mall]], Winston-Salem\n* [[Randolph Mall]], Asheboro\n\n== Transportation ==\n[[File:piedmonttriadfreewaymap.png|thumbnail|370px|right|Major roads and cities in the Piedmont Triad and two other nearby counties. The blue triangle represents the three points of the \"Triad\".]]\n\n=== Primary highways ===\n{{details|North Carolina Highway System}}\nThe Triad is home to an extensive [[freeway]] network, which is in the process of undergoing a major expansion. Four major [[Interstate highway]]s and numerous secondary Interstate routes and [[United States Numbered Highways|US routes]] serve the region:\n;Interstate highways\n*[[File:I-40.svg|20px]] [[Interstate 40 in North Carolina|I-40]], the primary east-west route across the region. In the eastern Triad, it is conjoined with I-85.  The two routes split in Greensboro.\n**[[File:I-840.svg|25px]] [[Greensboro Urban Loop|I-840]] (Painter Boulevard), part of the Greensboro Urban Loop, currently under construction.  When complete, I-840 will form the northern half of the loop.\n*[[File:I-73.svg|20px]] [[Interstate 73|I-73]], the primary north-south route across the region, much of which has yet to be constructed.  The route follows the current [[United States Route 220|US 220]], with the exception of a small segment that shares the southwestern portion of the Greensboro Outer Loop, and was briefly designated as [[I-40]] between its opening in February, 2008.  This portion was originally designated as [[I-40]], with the current and original [[I-40]] being re-designated as Business 40.\n*[[File:I-74.svg|20px]] [[Interstate 74 in North Carolina|I-74]], running across the region from southeast to northwest.  Like I-73, much of the route has yet to be constructed, but several disjointed segments are currently open and signed as either I-74 or \"FUTURE I-74\".  The route enters the region from the south conjoined with I-73, and diverges from there north of Asheboro toward High Point.  The southern segment presently terminates at an intersection with I-40 east of Winston-Salem; new freeway is being built that will form the eastern segment of the [[Winston-Salem Beltway]]. The northern segment leaves US 52 in Mount Airy, heading northwest out of the region.\n**[[File:I-274.svg|25px]] [[Interstate 274|I-274]], currently only in the planning stages, is the proposed designation for the western half of the Winston-Salem Beltway.\n*[[File:I-85.svg|20px]] [[Interstate 85 in North Carolina|I-85]], connects the region to [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]] and points southwest.

The entire freeway is planned for upgrade to Interstate standards. North of Winston-Salem the route is scheduled to become part of I-74 (a small segment near Mount Airy is currently signed as I-74), while south of the city it is cosigned with I-285.\n*[[File:US 64.svg|20px]] [[U.S. Route 64 in North Carolina|US 64]] is an east-west highway through the southern Triad, connecting Asheboro, Lexington, and Mocksville.\n*[[File:US 70.svg|20px]] [[U.S. Route 70 in North Carolina|US 70]] is an east-west highway that closely parallels I-85 through the entire region.\n*[[File:US 158.svg|25px]] [[U.S. Route 158|US 158]] runs roughly northeast-southwest across the region, terminating in Mocksville near the intersection of US 64 and I-40.\n*[[File:US 220.svg|25px]] [[U.S. Route 220|US 220]] is currently the primary north-south route through Greensboro; the entire route is scheduled to be upgraded to or bypassed by I-73.\n*[[File:US 311.svg|25px]] [[U.S. Route 311|US 311]] is a nominally north-south route that runs northeast-southwest between Danville, VA and Winston-Salem. Most of the former alignment south of Winston-Salem has been upgraded as part of I-74; signs currently remain on much of this alignment.\n*[[File:US 421.svg|25px]] [[U.S. Route 421|US 421]] enters the region from the southeast, and joins I-85 in Greensboro. It then takes I-85 South to I-73 North to western Greensboro. The route is then co-signed with I-40 briefly. After leaving Greensboro, it continues through Winston-Salem, the rural area of Yakdinville, and continues into Wilkesboro. \n\n=== Air ===\n====Piedmont Triad International Airport (PTI)====\n{{Main|Piedmont Triad International Airport}}\n\n=== Mass transportation ===\nPiedmont Authority for Regional Transportation (PART) is the Triad's 10-county regional organization with the goal of enhancing all forms of transportation through regional cooperation.
