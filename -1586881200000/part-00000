Yet tactical changes in foreign policy are not sufficient for the purposes of evaluating political and academic links. There are also ways in which Libyan foreign policy has ''not'' changed: the country continues to call for the destruction of Israel; Muammar Gaddafi recently called for the abolition of Switzerland, and he receives the leader of the [[Piracy in Somalia|Somali pirates]] operating off the Horn of Africa as honoured guests of state. Moreover, Libya's handling of the Lockerbie bombing \"has not been characterised by either consistency or clarity,\"\n\nI have in the past, Halliday noted, defended accepting grants from authoritarian regimes such as the Gulf states, \"but there should be clear limits on this, depending on the degree of political and human rights abuses perpetrated with them and on their ongoing foreign policy conduct.\" Whitehall and the City are now happy to do business with Libya, but it does not follow that the LSE should do the same. Responsible leaders throughout the Middle East continue to express reservations regarding Libya, including \"its more prominent 'liberal' representatives.\" We must remember, Halliday concluded, that the \"liberal\" wing within a regime such as Libya does not have the function of producing change but its role is instead \"to reach compromises with internal hard-liners that serve to lessen external pressure.\" A good case in point are the proposals LSE now is considering.

The inquiry report says it was Professor Held, who \"first approached Saif about the possibility of funding his centre for Global Governance in December 2008\". This was after the dictator's son had been awarded his PhD by the LSE but before the formal graduation ceremony. The gift offered was of \u00a31.5m in tranches of \u00a3300,000 over a five-year period. Periodic payments were to be made annually. The report says: \"This was not a one-off donation but the founding of a relationship between the school and the donor, which is not unusual. However, bearing in mind the volatility of the Gaddafi regime, the gift involved a substantial risk because of the length of the relationship.\" A decision was made that the gift would not come from Saif directly but from \"private sector sources\". This step \"became essential to Professor Held's presentation of the gift. Unless the money could be shown as coming to the foundation from private sources it could have been seen as unacceptable money from the Libyan state.\"Woolf writes: \"I come to no conclusions as to whether there was or would have been excessive influence by the donor over the use of the funds from Saif's foundation. However, what has been made plain is that proper structures of governance are needed to protect academic integrity against influence from the interests of private donors.\" The funding was accepted despite internal protest. Fred Halliday, a distinguished Middle East expert at the LSE before his death, criticised the donation in a letter that described the country's rulers as a \"secretive, erratic and corrupt elite\". Held was appointed to the board of the Gaddafi foundation on 28 June 2009, a few days after the gift was discussed and accepted by the university's governing body. Held subsequently resigned from the charity on the LSE council's advice.\n\nDespite institutional and procedural criticism the Woolf report, however, exonerated LSE staff (including David Held) stating that they acted in what they believed to be the best interests of the school.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=418293 |title=LSE's 'mistakes were legion' in Libyan dealings, Woolf finds &#124; Times Higher Education (THE) |publisher=Times Higher Education |date= |accessdate=2019-09-15}}</ref>\nQuestions remain, however, about the involvement of elite British academics at the LSE with the Gaddafi regime.\n\n==LSE's video link-up with Gaddafi==\nOn 2 December 2010, in a video-link conference hosted by the LSE, of LSE Global Governance, introduced [[Muammar Gaddafi]] as \"Brother Leader,\" and referred to him as \"the world's longest serving national leader.\"\n<blockquote>I will be chairing this on behalf of Howard Davies, the LSE's Director who unfortunately couldn't make it this evening, but who sends the following message, \u201cYou are most welcome here Colonel Gaddafi.

Woolf summarised his central conclusion as\n<blockquote>The School established, in an incremental and piecemeal fashion, a relationship with Libya. Before a global company embarks upon a relationship with a foreign partner, a due diligence assessment should be conducted. No similar exercise took place in this case. The links were allowed to grow, unchecked and to a degree unnoticed, until their effect was overwhelming. In October 2009, the LSE\u2019s Council resolved that the links should be monitored carefully in future. That monitoring came too late. By October 2009 the relationship with Libya had been well established. In addition, the history of the developing connection between the LSE and Libya has exposed a disconcerting number of failures in communication and governance within the School. The errors which I detail in the remaining chapters of this Report exceed those that should have occurred in an institution of the LSE\u2019s distinction. The pattern is such that I am driven to the central conclusion that there were shortcomings in the governance structure and management at the LSE.<ref>[http://woolflse.com/dl/woolf-lse-report.pdf Woolf Inquiry p22]</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Other universities with Libyan links==\n\nOn 19 May 2009, the French-language journal Jeune Afrique published an investigative report on the Gaddafi family's public relations campaign set up by Monitor.

Yet tactical changes in foreign policy are not sufficient for the purposes of evaluating political and academic links. There are also ways in which Libyan foreign policy has ''not'' changed: the country continues to call for the destruction of Israel; Muammar Gaddafi recently called for the abolition of Switzerland, and he receives the leader of the [[Piracy in Somalia|Somali pirates]] operating off the Horn of Africa as honoured guests of state. Moreover, Libya's handling of the Lockerbie bombing \"has not been characterised by either consistency or clarity,\"\n\nI have in the past, Halliday noted, defended accepting grants from authoritarian regimes such as the Gulf states, \"but there should be clear limits on this, depending on the degree of political and human rights abuses perpetrated with them and on their ongoing foreign policy conduct.\" Whitehall and the City are now happy to do business with Libya, but it does not follow that the LSE should do the same. Responsible leaders throughout the Middle East continue to express reservations regarding Libya, including \"its more prominent 'liberal' representatives.\" We must remember, Halliday concluded, that the \"liberal\" wing within a regime such as Libya does not have the function of producing change but its role is instead \"to reach compromises with internal hard-liners that serve to lessen external pressure.\" A good case in point are the proposals LSE now is considering. It is, as LSE alumni in positions of responsibility in the region caution, \"far too early for the School to take this step.\"<ref name=\"Halliday\" />\n\n==Human Rights Watch criticism==\nIn 2009, [[Human Rights Watch]] was allowed entry to Libya, via [[Saif al-Islam Gaddafi]]'s non-profit organization in order to gather facts about the human rights situation there.<ref>[https://www.hrw.org/news/2009/12/12/libya-repressive-atmosphere-pockets-improvement Libya: In Repressive Atmosphere, Pockets of Improvement]</ref> While HRW reported that there were concerns about the \"repressive atmosphere,\" they felt there were signs of \"improvement\" and [[Sarah Leah Whitson]], director of HRW's Middle East division said that one should not \"underestimate the importance of the efforts made so far\" by Gaddafi in the realm of human rights in Libya. She also wrote of her official visit that \"the real impetus for the transformation rests squarely with a quasi-governmental organization, the Qaddafi Foundation for International Charities and Development\" chaired by Gaddafi. She praised Gaddafi for establishing the country's two semi-private newspapers, and said \"it is impossible to underestimate the importance of the efforts made so far.

This was later followed by Ganesen saying that \"the London School of Economics did not act until Saif al-Islam's father literally began to kill his own people\".

The inquiry report says it was Professor Held, who \"first approached Saif about the possibility of funding his centre for Global Governance in December 2008\". This was after the dictator's son had been awarded his PhD by the LSE but before the formal graduation ceremony. The gift offered was of \u00a31.5m in tranches of \u00a3300,000 over a five-year period. Periodic payments were to be made annually. The report says: \"This was not a one-off donation but the founding of a relationship between the school and the donor, which is not unusual. However, bearing in mind the volatility of the Gaddafi regime, the gift involved a substantial risk because of the length of the relationship.\" A decision was made that the gift would not come from Saif directly but from \"private sector sources\". This step \"became essential to Professor Held's presentation of the gift. Unless the money could be shown as coming to the foundation from private sources it could have been seen as unacceptable money from the Libyan state.\"Woolf writes: \"I come to no conclusions as to whether there was or would have been excessive influence by the donor over the use of the funds from Saif's foundation. However, what has been made plain is that proper structures of governance are needed to protect academic integrity against influence from the interests of private donors.\" The funding was accepted despite internal protest. Fred Halliday, a distinguished Middle East expert at the LSE before his death, criticised the donation in a letter that described the country's rulers as a \"secretive, erratic and corrupt elite\". Held was appointed to the board of the Gaddafi foundation on 28 June 2009, a few days after the gift was discussed and accepted by the university's governing body. Held subsequently resigned from the charity on the LSE council's advice.\n\nDespite institutional and procedural criticism the Woolf report, however, exonerated LSE staff (including David Held) stating that they acted in what they believed to be the best interests of the school.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=418293 |title=LSE's 'mistakes were legion' in Libyan dealings, Woolf finds &#124; Times Higher Education (THE) |publisher=Times Higher Education |date= |accessdate=2019-09-15}}</ref>\nQuestions remain, however, about the involvement of elite British academics at the LSE with the Gaddafi regime.\n\n==LSE's video link-up with Gaddafi==\nOn 2 December 2010, in a video-link conference hosted by the LSE, of LSE Global Governance, introduced [[Muammar Gaddafi]] as \"Brother Leader,\" and referred to him as \"the world's longest serving national leader.\"\n<blockquote>I will be chairing this on behalf of Howard Davis, the LSE's Director who unfortunately couldn't make it this evening, but who sends the following message, \u201cYou are most welcome here Colonel Gaddafi.

Woolf summarised his central conclusion as\n<blockquote>The School established, in an incremental and piecemeal fashion, a relationship with Libya. Before a global company embarks upon a relationship with a foreign partner, a due diligence assessment should be conducted. No similar exercise took place in this case. The links were allowed to grow, unchecked and to a degree unnoticed, until their effect was overwhelming. In October 2009, the LSE\u2019s Council resolved that the links should be monitored carefully in future. That monitoring came too late. By October 2009 the relationship with Libya had been well established. In addition, the history of the developing connection between the LSE and Libya has exposed a disconcerting number of failures in communication and governance within the School. The errors which I detail in the remaining chapters of this Report exceed those that should have occurred in an institution of the LSE\u2019s distinction.

His pontificate initiated the [[Counter-Reformation]] with the [[Council of Trent]] in 1545, as well as the [[European wars of religion|Wars of religion]] with Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]'s military campaigns against the Protestants in Germany. He recognized new Catholic religious orders and societies such as the [[Jesuits]], the [[Barnabites]], and the [[Congregation of the Oratory]]. His efforts were distracted by [[Nepotism#Origins|nepotism]] to advance the power and fortunes of his family, including his illegitimate son Pier Luigi Farnese.\n\nPaul III was a significant patron of artists including [[Michelangelo]], and it is to him that [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] dedicated his heliocentric treatise''.''\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early career and family===\nBorn in 1468 at [[Canino]], [[Latium]] (then part of the Papal States), Alessandro Farnese was the oldest son of Pier Luigi I Farnese, Signore di [[Montalto di Castro|Montalto]] (1435\u20131487) and his wife Giovanna Caetani,<ref name=Loughlin>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11579a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Pope Paul III|website=www.newadvent.org}}</ref> a member of the [[Caetani]] family which had also produced [[Pope Boniface VIII]]. The [[Farnese family]] had prospered over the centuries but it was Alessandro's ascendency to the papacy and his dedication to family interests which brought about the most significant increase in the family's wealth and power.\n\nAlessandro's humanist education was at the [[University of Pisa]] and the court of [[Lorenzo de' Medici]].<ref>Verellen Till R. Pope Paul III (Alessandro Farnese) Oxford  Online</ref> Initially trained as an [[apostolic notary]], he joined the [[Roman Curia]] in 1491 and in 1493 [[Pope Alexander VI]] appointed him Cardinal-Deacon of ''[[Santi Cosma e Damiano]]''. Farnese's sister, [[Giulia Farnese|Giulia]], was reputedly a mistress of Alexander VI, and might have been instrumental in securing this appointment for her brother. For this reason, he was sometimes mockingly referred to as the \"Borgia brother-in-law,\" just as Giulia was mocked as \"the Bride of Christ.\" \n\nAs a young cleric, Alessandro lived a notably dissolute life, taking a mistress, Silvia Ruffini, and having three sons and two daughters with her, including [[Pier Luigi Farnese|Pier Luigi II Farnese]], whom he created [[Duke of Parma]], as well as [[Ranuccio Farnese (1509\u20131529)|Ranuccio Farnese]] and [[Costanza Farnese]].<ref name=Concordia/> Another epithet leveled at him was \"Cardinal Fregnese\" (translated as Cardinal Cunt).<ref>Martin Gayford, ''Michelangelo: His epic life'', p. 71</ref> \n\nAs Bishop of Parma, he came under the influence of his vicar-general, Bartolomeo Guidiccioni. This led to the future pope breaking off the relationship with his mistress and committing himself to reform in his Parma diocese.<ref name=\"Concordia\" /> Under [[Pope Clement VII]] (1523\u201334) he became [[Cardinal Bishop of Ostia]] and [[Dean of the College of Cardinals]], and on the death of Clement VII in 1534, was elected as Pope Paul III.\n\nThe elevation to the cardinalate of his grandsons, [[Alessandro Farnese (cardinal)|Alessandro Farnese]], aged fourteen, and [[Guido Ascanio Sforza]], aged sixteen, displeased the reform party and drew a protest from the emperor, but this was forgiven when, shortly after, he introduced into the Sacred College [[Reginald Pole]], [[Gasparo Contarini]], [[Jacopo Sadoleto]], and Giovanni Pietro Caraffa,<ref name=\"Loughlin\" /> who became [[Pope Paul IV]].\n\n[[File:Tizian 068.jpg|thumb|200px|right|''[[Pope Paul III and his Grandsons]]'' Cardinal [[Alessandro Farnese (cardinal)|Alessandro Farnese]] (left), and [[Ottavio Farnese, Duke of Parma]] (right), II Duke of Parma since 1547. A triple portrait by [[Titian]], 1546]]\n\n==Politics and religion==\nThe fourth pope during the period of the [[Protestant Reformation]], Paul III became the first to take active reform measures in response to Protestantism.<ref name=Concordia>[http://reformation500.csl.edu/bio/paul-iii/ \"Pope Paul III\", ''Reformation 500'' Concordia University] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911091847/http://reformation500.csl.edu/bio/paul-iii/ |date=2014-09-11 }}</ref> Soon after his elevation, 2 June 1536, Paul III summoned a general council to meet at Mantua in the following May; but the opposition of the Protestant princes and the refusal of the Duke of Mantua to assume the responsibility of maintaining order frustrated the project.<ref name=Loughlin/> Paul III first deferred for a year and then discarded the whole project.\n\nIn 1536, Paul III invited a committee of nine eminent [[prelate]]s, distinguished by learning and piety alike, to report on the reformation and rebuilding of the Church. In 1537 they produced the celebrated ''[[Consilium de Emendanda Ecclesia|Consilium de emendenda ecclesia]]'',<ref>{{cite book| last=le Plat |first=J. |title=Monumenta ad historiam Concilii Tridentini |pages=ii. 596\u2013597 |language=Latin |place= Leuven |date=1782}}</ref> exposing gross abuses in the [[Roman Curia]], the church administration, and public worship; and proffering bold proposals aimed at abolishing such abuses. The report was widely printed, and the Pope was in earnest when he took up the problem of reform. He clearly perceived that [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]] would not rest until the problems were grappled with in earnest.\n\nBut to the Protestants the report seemed far from thorough; [[Martin Luther]] had his edition (1538) prefaced with a vignette showing the cardinals cleaning the [[Augeas|Augean stable]] of the Roman Church with foxtails instead of brooms. In the end, no results followed from the committee's recommendations. \n\nAs a consequence of the extensive campaign against \"idolatry\" in England, culminating with the dismantling of the shrine of St. Thomas Becket at Canterbury, the Pope excommunicated Henry VIII on 17 December 1538 and issued an interdict.\n                      \nAround this time, family complications arose. In order to vest his grandson [[Ottavio Farnese, Duke of Parma|Ottavio Farnese]] with the dukedom of [[Camerino]], Paul forcibly wrested the same from the duke of [[Urbino]] (1540). He also incurred virtual war with his own subjects and vassals by the imposition of burdensome taxes. [[Perugia]], renouncing its obedience, was besieged by Paul's son, Pier Luigi, and forfeited its freedom entirely on its surrender. The burghers of [[Colonna]] were duly vanquished, and Ascanio was banished (1541). After this the time seemed ripe for annihilating heresy.\n\nIn 1540, the Church officially recognized the new society forming about [[Ignatius of Loyola]], which became the [[Society of Jesus]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://personal.ashland.edu/~jmoser1/jesuits.htm|title=POPE PAUL III'S APPROVAL OF THE SOCIETY OF JESUS (1540)|website=personal.ashland.edu}}</ref> In 1542, a second stage in the process of Counter-Reformation was marked by the institution, or reorganization, of the Congregation of the Holy Office of the [[Inquisition]].\n\nOn another side, the Emperor was insisting that Rome should forward his designs towards a peaceable recovery of the German Protestants. Accordingly, the Pope despatched [[Giovanni Morone]] (not yet a cardinal) as [[nuncio]] to [[Hagenau]] and [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] in 1540; and in 1541 Cardinal [[Gasparo Contarini]] took part in the adjustment proceedings at the [[Conference of Regensburg]]. It was Contarini who proposed the famous formula \"by faith alone are we justified,\" which did not, however, supersede the Roman Catholic doctrine of good works. At Rome, this definition was rejected in the [[papal consistory|consistory]] of 27 May, and Luther declared that he could accept it only provided the opposers would admit that this formula constituted a change of doctrine.\n[[File:Titian - Ranuccio Farnese - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ranuccio Farnese (cardinal)|Ranuccio Farnese]] was made cardinal by Paul III at the age of 15.]]\n\nYet, even after the Regensburg Conference had proved fruitless, the Emperor insisted on a still larger council, with the final result being the [[Council of Trent]], which was finally convoked on 15 March 1545, under the bull ''Laetare Hierusalem''.\n\nMeanwhile, after the peace of [[Crespy]] (September 1544), Emperor Charles V (1519\u201356) began to put down Protestantism by force. Pending the [[Diet of Worms]] in 1545, the Emperor concluded a covenant of joint action with the papal legate Cardinal Alessandro Farnese, with Paul III agreeing to aid in the projected war against the German Protestant princes and estates. This prompt acquiescence was probably grounded on personal motives: since the Emperor was preoccupied in Germany, the moment now seemed opportune for the Pope to acquire for his son Pier Luigi the duchies of [[Parma]] and [[Piacenza]]. Although these belonged to the [[Papal States]], Paul III planned to overcome the reluctance of the cardinals by exchanging these papal duchies for the less valuable domains of Camerino and [[Nepi]]. The Emperor agreed, welcoming the prospect of 12,000 infantry, 500 cavalry, and considerable funds from the Pope.\n\nIn Germany the campaign began in the west, where [[Electorate of Cologne|Archbishop of Cologne]] [[Hermann of Wied]] had converted to Protestantism in 1542. Emperor Charles began open warfare against the Protestant princes, estates, and cities allied in the [[Schmalkaldic League]] (see [[Philip of Hesse]]). Hermann was excommunicated on 16 April 1546, and was compelled by the Emperor to abdicate in February 1547. By the close of 1546, Charles V had subjugated South Germany. The victory at the [[Battle of M\u00fchlberg]], on 24 April 1547, established his imperial sovereignty everywhere in Germany, and the two leaders of the League were captured. The Emperor declared the [[Augsburg Interim]] as a magnanimous compromise with the defeated schismatics.\n[[File:Farnese detail.JPG|thumb|300px|right|The Farnese coat of arms or ''stemma'' on the facade of the [[Farnese Palace]] in [[Rome]]]]\n\n[[File:S. Peter, Rome, Italy. (2830835909).jpg|thumbnail|left|Rome, Italy. St. Peter's, tomb of Paul III. Brooklyn Museum Archives, Goodyear Archival Collection]]\nAlthough the Emperor had subdued the German Protestant armies, he had failed to support the Pope's territorial ambitions for his son Pier Luigi, and relations between them cooled. The situation came to a total rupture when the imperial vice-regent, [[Ferrante Gonzaga]], forcibly expelled Pier Luigi.\n\nIn 1547 the Pope's son was assassinated at [[Piacenza]], and Paul III placed some of the blame on the emperor. In the same year, however, and after the death of [[Francis I of France]] (1515\u201347) deprived the Pope of a potential ally, the stress of circumstances compelled him to accept the ecclesiastical measures in the Emperor's Interim.\n\nWith reference to the assassinated prince's inheritance, the restitution of which Paul III demanded ostensibly in the name of the Church, the Pope's design was thwarted by the Emperor, who refused to surrender Piacenza, and by Pier Luigi's heir in Parma, [[Ottavio Farnese, Duke of Parma|Ottavio Farnese]].\n\nIn consequence of a violent altercation on this account with Cardinal Farnese, Paul III, at the age of eighty-one years, became so overwrought that an attack of sickness ensued from which he died, 10 November 1549.\n\nPaul III proved unable to suppress the [[Protestant Reformation]], although it was during his pontificate that the foundation was laid for the [[Counter-Reformation]]. He decreed the second and final [[Excommunication (Catholic Church)|excommunication]] of [[Henry VIII of England]] in December 1538. His efforts in Parma led to the [[War of Parma]] two years after his death.\n\n==Slavery and ''Sublimis Deus''==\nIn May\u2013June 1537 Paul issued the bull ''[[Sublimis Deus]]'' (also known as ''Unigenitus'' and ''Veritas ipsa''), described by Prein (2008) as the \"Magna Carta\" for the human rights of the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] in its declaration that \"the Indians were human beings and they were not to be robbed of their freedom or possessions\". The subsequent implementing document ''Pastorale officium'' declared automatic excommunication for anyone who failed to abide by the new ruling.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\"The Encyclopedia Of Christianity\", p. 212</ref> \n\nHowever, it met with strong opposition from the Council of The West Indies and the Crown, which declared that it violated their patronato rights, and the Pope annulled the orders the following year with the document ''Non Indecens Videtur''.<ref>Stogre, p. 115, fn. 133</ref> Stogre (1992) notes that ''Sublimis Deus'' is not present in [[Denzinger]], the authoritative compendium of official Catholic teachings, and Davis (1988) asserts it was annulled due to a dispute with the Spanish crown.<ref>Davis, p. 170, fn. 9</ref> However, the original bull continued to circulate and be quoted by [[Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas|las Casas]] and others who supported Indian rights.<ref>Lampe, p. 17</ref>\n\nAccording to Falkowski (2002) ''Sublimis Deus'' had the effect of revoking the bull of Alexander VI, ''[[Inter caetera]]'', but still leaving the colonizers the duty of converting the native people.<ref>Thornberry 2002, p. 65, fn. 21</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> Father [[Gustavo Gutierrez]] describes it as \"the most important papal document relating to the condition of native Indians and that it was addressed to all Christians\".<ref>Panzer, 2008</ref> Maxwell (1975) notes that the bull did not change the traditional teaching that the enslavement of Indians was permissible if they were considered \"enemies of Christendom\", as this would be considered by the Church as a \"just war\". He further argues that the Indian nations had every right to self-defence.<ref>Stogre, p. 115-116</ref> Stark (2003) describes the bull as \"magnificent\" and believes that it was long forgotten due to the neglect of Protestant historians.<ref>Stark 2003</ref> Falola notes that the bull related to the native populations of the New World and did not condemn the transatlantic slave trade stimulated by the Spanish monarchy and the Holy Roman Emperor.<ref>Falola, p. 107; see also Maxwell , p. 73</ref>\n\nIn 1545, Paul repealed an ancient law that allowed slaves to claim their freedom under the Emperor's statue on Rome's [[Capitoline Hill]], in view of the number of homeless people and tramps in the city.<ref>Davis, p. 56\"</ref> The decree included those who had become Christians after their enslavement and those born to Christian slaves. The right of inhabitants of Rome to publicly buy and sell slaves of both sexes was affirmed.<ref>Noonan, p. 79, Stogre, p. 116</ref> Stogre (1992) asserts that the lifting of restrictions was due to a shortage of slaves in Rome.<ref>Stogre, p. 116</ref> In 1548, Paul authorized the purchase and possession of Muslim slaves in the Papal states.<ref>Clarence-Smith</ref>\n\nAlso in 1537, Paul issued the bull, ''Altitudo divini consilii''.  The bull discusses evangelization and conversion, including the proper way to apply the sacraments, in particular baptism. This was especially important in the early days of colonial rule, when hundreds and sometimes thousands of indigenous people were baptized every day. One interesting aspect of this bull is its discussion of how to deal with local practices, for example, polygamy. After their conversion, polygamous men had to marry their first wife, but if they could not remember which wife was the first, they then \"could choose among the wives the one they preferred.\"<ref>{{Citation|last=\u0420\u0438\u043c\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439|first=\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439: \u041f\u0430\u0432\u0435\u043b III, \u043f\u0430\u043f\u0430|title=\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439: \u0412\u043e \u0438\u043c\u044f \u0412\u043e \u0438\u043c\u044f \u0421\u0432\u044f\u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e...

Although the work was commissioned by Paul III's predecessor, [[Pope Clement VII]], following the latter's death in 1534 Paul renewed the commission and oversaw its completion in 1541.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vaticanstate.va/it/|title=Home|website=www.vaticanstate.va|access-date=2019-11-11}}</ref>\n\nAs a cardinal, Alessandro had begun construction of the [[Palazzo Farnese]] in central Rome, and its planned size and magnificence increased upon his election to the papacy. The palace was initially designed by the architect [[Antonio da Sangallo the Younger]], received further architectural refinement from [[Michelangelo]], and was completed by [[Giacomo della Porta]]. Like other Farnese family buildings, the imposing palace proclaims the family's power and wealth, similarly to Alessandro's [[Villa Farnese]] at Caprarola.\nIn 1546, after the death of Sangallo, Paul appointed the elderly Michelangelo to take supervision of the building of [[St. Peter's Basilica]]. Paul also commissioned Michelangelo to paint the 'Crucifixion of St. Peter' and the 'Conversion of St. Paul' (1542\u201350), his last frescoes, in the [[Cappella Paolina|Pauline Chapel]] of the Vatican.\n\nPaul III's artistic and architectural commissions were numerous and varied. The [[Venice|Venetian]] artist [[Titian]] painted a portrait of the Pope in 1543, and in 1546, the well-known portrait of Paul III with his grandsons Cardinal Alessandro Farnese and [[Ottavio Farnese, Duke of Parma]].  Both are now in the [[Capodimonte Museum]], [[Naples]]. The military fortifications in Rome and the Papal States were strengthened during his reign.<ref>Verellen Till R. , ibid.</ref> He had Michelangelo relocate the ancient bronze of the Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] to the [[Capitoline Hill]], where it became the centerpiece to the [[Piazza del Campidoglio]].\n\nPaul III's bronze tomb, executed by [[Guglielmo della Porta]], is in St. Peter's.\n\n==Fictional portrayals==\n[[Stendhal]]'s novel ''[[La Chartreuse de Parme]]'' was inspired by an inauthentic Italian account of the dissolute youth of Alessandro Farnese.<ref>M.

The report was widely printed, and the Pope was in earnest when he took up the problem of reform. He clearly perceived that [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]] would not rest until the problems were grappled with in earnest.\n\nBut to the Protestants the report seemed far from thorough; [[Martin Luther]] had his edition (1538) prefaced with a vignette showing the cardinals cleaning the [[Augeas|Augean stable]] of the Roman Church with foxtails instead of brooms. In the end, no results followed from the committee's recommendations. \n\nAs a consequence of the extensive campaign against \"idolatry\" in England, culminating with the dismantling of the shrine of St. Thomas Becket at Canterbury, the Pope excommunicated Henry VIII on 17 December 1538 and issued an interdict.\n                      \nAround this time, family complications arose. In order to vest his grandson [[Ottavio Farnese, Duke of Parma|Ottavio Farnese]] with the dukedom of [[Camerino]], Paul forcibly wrested the same from the duke of [[Urbino]] (1540). He also incurred virtual war with his own subjects and vassals by the imposition of burdensome taxes. [[Perugia]], renouncing its obedience, was besieged by Paul's son, Pier Luigi, and forfeited its freedom entirely on its surrender. The burghers of [[Colonna]] were duly vanquished, and Ascanio was banished (1541). After this the time seemed ripe for annihilating heresy.\n\nIn 1540, the Church officially recognized the new society forming about [[Ignatius of Loyola]], which became the [[Society of Jesus]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://personal.ashland.edu/~jmoser1/jesuits.htm|title=POPE PAUL III'S APPROVAL OF THE SOCIETY OF JESUS (1540)|website=personal.ashland.edu}}</ref> In 1542, a second stage in the process of Counter-Reformation was marked by the institution, or reorganization, of the Congregation of the Holy Office of the [[Inquisition]].\n\nOn another side, the Emperor was insisting that Rome should forward his designs towards a peaceable recovery of the German Protestants. Accordingly, the Pope despatched [[Giovanni Morone]] (not yet a cardinal) as [[nuncio]] to [[Hagenau]] and [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] in 1540; while in 1541, Cardinal [[Gasparo Contarini]] took part in the adjustment proceedings at the [[Conference of Regensburg]]. It was Contarini who proposed the famous formula \"by faith alone are we justified,\" which did not, however, supersede the Roman Catholic doctrine of good works. At Rome, this definition was rejected in the [[papal consistory|consistory]] of 27 May, and Luther declared that he could accept it only provided the opposers would admit that this formula constituted a change of doctrine.\n[[File:Titian - Ranuccio Farnese - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ranuccio Farnese (cardinal)|Ranuccio Farnese]] was made cardinal by Paul III at the age of 15.]]\n\nYet, even after the Regensburg Conference had proved fruitless, the Emperor insisted on a still larger council, with the final result being the [[Council of Trent]], which was finally convoked on 15 March 1545, under the bull ''Laetare Hierusalem''.\n\nMeanwhile, after the peace of [[Crespy]] (September 1544), Emperor Charles V (1519\u201356) began to put down Protestantism by force. Pending the [[Diet of Worms]] in 1545, the Emperor concluded a covenant of joint action with the papal legate Cardinal Alessandro Farnese, with Paul III agreeing to aid in the projected war against the German Protestant princes and estates. This prompt acquiescence was probably grounded on personal motives: since the Emperor was preoccupied in Germany, the moment now seemed opportune for the Pope to acquire for his son Pier Luigi the duchies of [[Parma]] and [[Piacenza]]. Although these belonged to the [[Papal States]], Paul III planned to overcome the reluctance of the Cardinals by exchanging these Papal duchies for the less valuable domains of Camerino and [[Nepi]]. The Emperor agreed, welcoming the prospect of 12,000 infantry, 500 cavalry, and considerable funds from the Pope.\n\nIn Germany the campaign began in the west, where [[Electorate of Cologne|Archbishop of Cologne]] [[Hermann of Wied]] had converted to Protestantism in 1542. Emperor Charles began open warfare against the Protestant princes, estates, and cities allied in the [[Schmalkaldic League]] (see [[Philip of Hesse]]). Hermann was excommunicated on 16 April 1546, and was compelled by the Emperor to abdicate in February 1547. By the close of 1546, Charles V had subjugated South Germany. The victory at the [[Battle of M\u00fchlberg]], on 24 April 1547, established his imperial sovereignty everywhere in Germany, and the two leaders of the League were captured. The Emperor declared the [[Augsburg Interim]] as a magnanimous compromise with the defeated schismatics.\n[[File:Farnese detail.JPG|thumb|300px|right|The Farnese coat of arms or ''stemma'' on the facade of the [[Farnese Palace]] in [[Rome]]]]\n\n[[File:S. Peter, Rome, Italy. (2830835909).jpg|thumbnail|left|Rome, Italy. St. Peter's, tomb of Paul III. Brooklyn Museum Archives, Goodyear Archival Collection]]\nAlthough the Emperor had subdued the German Protestant armies, he had failed to support the Pope's territorial ambitions for his son Pier Luigi, and relations between them cooled. The situation came to a total rupture when the imperial vice-regent, [[Ferrante Gonzaga]], forcibly expelled Pier Luigi.\n\nIn 1547 the Pope's son was assassinated at [[Piacenza]], and Paul III placed some of the blame on the emperor. In the same year, however, and after the death of [[Francis I of France]] (1515\u201347) deprived the Pope of a potential ally, the stress of circumstances compelled him to accept the ecclesiastical measures in the Emperor's Interim.\n\nWith reference to the assassinated prince's inheritance, the restitution of which Paul III demanded ostensibly in the name of the Church, the Pope's design was thwarted by the Emperor, who refused to surrender Piacenza, and by Pier Luigi's heir in Parma, [[Ottavio Farnese, Duke of Parma|Ottavio Farnese]].\n\nIn consequence of a violent altercation on this account with Cardinal Farnese, Paul III, at the age of eighty-one years, became so overwrought that an attack of sickness ensued from which he died, 10 November 1549.\n\nPaul III proved unable to suppress the [[Protestant Reformation]], although it was during his pontificate that the foundation was laid for the [[Counter-Reformation]]. He decreed the second and final [[Excommunication (Catholic Church)|excommunication]] of [[Henry VIII of England]] in December 1538. His efforts in Parma led to the [[War of Parma]] two years after his death.\n\n==Slavery and ''Sublimis Deus''==\nIn May\u2013June 1537 Paul issued the bull ''[[Sublimis Deus]]'' (also known as ''Unigenitus'' and ''Veritas ipsa''), described by Prein (2008) as the \"Magna Carta\" for the human rights of the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] in its declaration that \"the Indians were human beings and they were not to be robbed of their freedom or possessions\". The subsequent implementing document ''Pastorale officium'' declared automatic excommunication for anyone who failed to abide by the new ruling.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\"The Encyclopedia Of Christianity\", p. 212</ref> \n\nHowever, it met with strong opposition from the Council of The West Indies and the Crown, which declared that it violated their patronato rights, and the Pope annulled the orders the following year with the document ''Non Indecens Videtur''.<ref>Stogre, p. 115, fn. 133</ref> Stogre (1992) notes that ''Sublimis Deus'' is not present in [[Denzinger]], the authoritative compendium of official Catholic teachings, and Davis (1988) asserts it was annulled due to a dispute with the Spanish crown.<ref>Davis, p. 170, fn. 9</ref> However, the original bull continued to circulate and be quoted by [[Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas|las Casas]] and others who supported Indian rights.<ref>Lampe, p. 17</ref>\n\nAccording to Falkowski (2002) ''Sublimis Deus'' had the effect of revoking the bull of Alexander VI, ''[[Inter caetera]]'', but still leaving the colonizers the duty of converting the native people.<ref>Thornberry 2002, p. 65, fn. 21</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> Father [[Gustavo Gutierrez]] describes it as \"the most important papal document relating to the condition of native Indians and that it was addressed to all Christians\".<ref>Panzer, 2008</ref> Maxwell (1975) notes that the bull did not change the traditional teaching that the enslavement of Indians was permissible if they were considered \"enemies of Christendom\", as this would be considered by the Church as a \"just war\". He further argues that the Indian nations had every right to self-defence.<ref>Stogre, p. 115-116</ref> Stark (2003) describes the bull as \"magnificent\" and believes that it was long forgotten due to the neglect of Protestant historians.<ref>Stark 2003</ref> Falola notes that the bull related to the native populations of the New World and did not condemn the transatlantic slave trade stimulated by the Spanish monarchy and the Holy Roman Emperor.<ref>Falola, p. 107; see also Maxwell , p. 73</ref>\n\nIn 1545, Paul repealed an ancient law that allowed slaves to claim their freedom under the Emperor's statue on Rome's [[Capitoline Hill]], in view of the number of homeless people and tramps in the city.<ref>Davis, p. 56\"</ref> The decree included those who had become Christians after their enslavement and those born to Christian slaves. The right of inhabitants of Rome to publicly buy and sell slaves of both sexes was affirmed.<ref>Noonan, p. 79, Stogre, p. 116</ref> Stogre (1992) asserts that the lifting of restrictions was due to a shortage of slaves in Rome.<ref>Stogre, p. 116</ref> In 1548, Paul authorized the purchase and possession of Muslim slaves in the Papal states.<ref>Clarence-Smith</ref>\n\nAlso in 1537, Paul issued the bull, ''Altitudo divini consilii''.  The bull discusses evangelization and conversion, including the proper way to apply the sacraments, in particular baptism. This was especially important in the early days of colonial rule, when hundreds and sometimes thousands of indigenous people were baptized every day. One interesting aspect of this bull is its discussion of how to deal with local practices, for example, polygamy. After their conversion, polygamous men had to marry their first wife, but if they could not remember which wife was the first, they then \"could choose among the wives the one they preferred.\"<ref>{{Citation|last=\u0420\u0438\u043c\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439|first=\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439: \u041f\u0430\u0432\u0435\u043b III, \u043f\u0430\u043f\u0430|title=\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439: \u0412\u043e \u0438\u043c\u044f \u0412\u043e \u0438\u043c\u044f \u0421\u0432\u044f\u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e...

Although the work was commissioned by Paul III's predecessor, [[Pope Clement VII]], following the latter's death in 1534 Paul renewed the commission and oversaw its completion in 1541.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vaticanstate.va/it/|title=Home|website=www.vaticanstate.va|access-date=2019-11-11}}</ref>\n\nAs a cardinal, Alessandro had begun construction of the [[Palazzo Farnese]] in central Rome, and its planned size and magnificence increased upon his election to the papacy. The palace was initially designed by the architect [[Antonio da Sangallo the Younger]], received further architectural refinement from [[Michelangelo]], and was completed by [[Giacomo della Porta]]. Like other Farnese family buildings, the imposing palace proclaims the family's power and wealth, similarly to Alessandro's [[Villa Farnese]] at Caprarola.\nIn 1546, after the death of Sangallo, Paul appointed the elderly Michelangelo to take supervision of the building of [[St. Peter's Basilica]]. Paul also commissioned Michelangelo to paint the 'Crucifixion of St. Peter' and the 'Conversion of St. Paul' (1542\u201350), his last frescoes, in the [[Cappella Paolina|Pauline Chapel]] of the Vatican.\n\nPaul III's artistic and architectural commissions were numerous and varied. The [[Venice|Venetian]] artist [[Titian]] painted a portrait of the Pope in 1543, and in 1546, the well-known portrait of Paul III with his grandsons Cardinal Alessandro Farnese and [[Ottavio Farnese, Duke of Parma]].  Both are now in the [[Capodimonte Museum]], [[Naples]]. The military fortifications in Rome and the Papal States were strengthened during his reign.<ref>Verellen Till R. , ibid.</ref> He had Michelangelo relocate the ancient bronze of the Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] to the [[Capitoline Hill]], where it became the centerpiece to the [[Piazza del Campidoglio]].\n\nPaul III's bronze tomb, executed by [[Guglielmo della Porta]], is in St. Peter's.\n\n==Fictional portrayals==\n[[Stendhal]]'s novel ''[[La Chartreuse de Parme]]'' was inspired by an inauthentic Italian account of the dissolute youth of Alessandro Farnese.<ref>M. R. B. Shaw, introduction to [[Penguin Classics]] 1958 translation of ''[[The Charterhouse of Parma]]''</ref>  The character of [[List of The Tudors characters|Pope Paul III]], played by [[Peter O'Toole]] in the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] series ''[[The Tudors]]'', is loosely inspired by him.\nThe young Alessandro Farnese is played by [[Diarmuid Noyes]] in the StudioCanal serial ''[[Borgia (TV series)|Borgia]]'', and [[Cyron Melville]] in Showtime's ''[[The Borgias (2011 TV series)|The Borgias]]''. His image is portrayed in a parody of the [[Sgt Pepper|Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band Album]] cover, placed inside of the [[Frank Zappa]] [[Mothers of Invention]] ''[[We're Only In It For the Money]]'' album.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Cardinals created by Paul III]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* Clarence-Smith, William G.,  [https://web.archive.org/web/20070816155150/http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/economicHistory/GEHN/GEHNPDF/ClarenceSmithWASHINGTON.pdf \"Religions and the abolition of slavery&nbsp;\u2014 a comparative approach\"], at Global Economic History Network (GEHN) conference entitled 'Culture and economic performance', Washington DC, 7\u201310 September 2006.''\" <!-- dead url [http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/economicHistory/GEHN/GEHNPDF/ClarenceSmithWASHINGTON.pdf] -->\n*Davis, David Brion, ''The Problem of Slavery in Western Culture'', Oxford University Press U.S., 1988, {{ISBN|0-19-505639-6}}\n* ''The Encyclopedia Of Christianity'', Volume 5, Wm.
