In ancient [[Mesopotamia]] the cultures of ancient [[Sumer]] and [[Babylon]] erected artificial mountains, or [[ziggurat]]s, on the flat river plain. These supported staircases leading to temples at the top. The Hindu temples in India are often situated on high mountains. E.g. [[Amarnath Temple|Amarnath]], [[Tirumala Venkateswara Temple|Tirupati]], [[Vaishno Devi]] etc. The pre-Columbian residents of [[Teotihuac\u00e1n]] in [[Mexico]] erected huge [[pyramid]]s featuring staircases leading to heaven.

Wise religious teachers are typically depicted in literature and art as bringing their revelations at world centers: mountains, trees, temples.\n\nBecause the axis mundi is an idea that unites a number of concrete images, no contradiction exists in regarding multiple spots as \"the center of the world\".

Judaism has the [[Temple Mount]], Christianity has the [[Mount of Olives]] and [[Calvary]], Islam has the [[Ka'aba]], said to be the first building on earth, and the [[Temple Mount]] ([[Dome of the Rock]]).  In [[Hinduism]], [[Mount Kailash]] is identified with the mythical [[Mount Meru]] and regarded as the home of [[Shiva]]; in [[Vajrayana Buddhism]], Mount Kailash is recognized as the most sacred place where all the [[Ley line|dragon currents]] converge and is regarded as the gateway to [[Shambhala]].  In [[Shinto]], the [[Ise Shrine]] is the omphalos.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}  In addition to the [[Kunlun Mountain (mythology)|Kunlun Mountains]], where it is believed the [[peach tree of immortality]] is located, the [[Chinese folk religion]] recognizes four other specific mountains as pillars of the world.\n\nSacred places constitute world centers ([[omphalos]]) with the [[altar]] or place of prayer as the axis. Altars, incense sticks, candles and torches form the axis by sending a column of smoke, and prayer, toward heaven. The architecture of sacred places often reflects this role. \"Every temple or palace\u2014and by extension, every sacred city or royal residence\u2014is a Sacred Mountain, thus becoming a Centre.\"<ref name=\"Mircea Eliade 1971. p.12\">Mircea Eliade (tr.

[[Pagoda]] structures in Asian temples take the form of a stairway linking earth and heaven. A [[Steeple (architecture)|steeple]] in a church or a [[minaret]] in a mosque also serve as connections of earth and heaven.

[[Astrology]] in all its forms assumes a connection between human health and affairs and the orientation of these with celestial bodies. World religions regard the body itself as a temple and prayer as a column uniting earth to heaven. The ancient [[Colossus of Rhodes]] combined the role of human figure with those of portal and skyscraper. The image of a human being suspended on a tree or a cross locates the figure at the axis where heaven and earth meet. The Renaissance image known as the [[Vitruvian Man]] represented a symbolic and mathematical exploration of the human form as world axis.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Homes===\nHomes can represent world centers. The symbolism for their residents is the same as for inhabitants of palaces and other sacred mountains.<ref name=\"Mircea Eliade 1971. p.12\"/> The hearth participates in the symbolism of the [[altar]] and a central [[garden]] participates in the symbolism of primordial [[Garden of Eden|paradise]]. In Asian cultures houses were traditionally laid out in the form of a square oriented toward the four compass directions. A traditional Asian home was oriented toward the sky through [[feng shui]], a system of [[geomancy]], just as a palace would be. Traditional Arab houses are also laid out as a square surrounding a central fountain that evokes a primordial garden paradise. Mircea Eliade noted that \"the symbolism of the pillar in [European] peasant houses likewise derives from the 'symbolic field' of the ''axis mundi''. In many archaic dwellings the central pillar does in fact serve as a means of communication with the heavens, with the sky.\"<ref>Mircea Eliade.

A [[skyscraper]], as the term itself suggests, suggests the connection of earth and sky, as do [[spire]] structures of all sorts. Such buildings come to be regarded as \"centers\" of an inhabited area, or even the world, and serve as icons of its ideals.<ref>Judith Dupr\u00e9. 'Skyscrapers: A History of the World's Most Extraordinary Buildings.' Black Dog & Leventhal, 1998/2008. p.137</ref> The first skyscraper of modern times, the [[Eiffel Tower]], exemplifies this role. The structure was erected in 1889 in [[Paris]], [[France]], to serve as the centerpiece for the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|Exposition Universelle]], making it a symbolic world center from the planning stages. It has served as an iconic image for the city and the nation ever since.<ref>Judith Dupr\u00e9. 'Skyscrapers: A History of the World's Most Extraordinary Buildings.'

Just one example of these is the ''Colonne sans fin'' (''[[The Endless Column]]'', 1938) an abstract [[sculpture]] by Romanian [[Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i]].

Structures that have a spiritual meaning, that inspire and create a connection between the spiritual world and the physical world, that are erected as monuments to commemorate are achievements can be considered to be inspired by the axis mundi. The pyramids that have been erected throughout human history serve as perfect examples of axis mundi.  A [[skyscraper]], as the term itself suggests, suggests the connection of earth and sky, as do [[spire]] structures of all sorts. Such buildings come to be regarded as \"centers\" of an inhabited area, or even the world, and serve as icons of its ideals.<ref>Judith Dupr\u00e9. 'Skyscrapers: A History of the World's Most Extraordinary Buildings.' Black Dog & Leventhal, 1998/2008. p.137</ref> The first skyscraper of modern times, the [[Eiffel Tower]], exemplifies this role. The structure was erected in 1889 in [[Paris]], [[France]], to serve as the centerpiece for the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|Exposition Universelle]], making it a symbolic world center from the planning stages. It has served as an iconic image for the city and the nation ever since.<ref>Judith Dupr\u00e9. 'Skyscrapers: A History of the World's Most Extraordinary Buildings.' Black Dog & Leventhal, 1998/2008. p. 19</ref> Landmark skyscrapers often take names that clearly identify them as centers.<ref>Judith Dupr\u00e9. 'Skyscrapers: A History of the World's Most Extraordinary Buildings.' Black Dog & Leventhal, 1998/2008. pp. 45, 69, 81, 91, 97,135, 136, 143</ref>\n\nArtistic representations of the axis mundi are plentiful. Just one example of these is the ''Colonne sans fin'' (''[[The Endless Column]]'', 1938) an abstract [[sculpture]] by Romanian [[Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i]]. The column takes the form of a \"sky pillar\" ({{lang|ro|{{vanchor|columna cerului}}}}) upholding the heavens even as its rhythmically repeating segments invite climb and suggest the possibility of ascension.<ref>Mircea Eliade. 'Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i and Mythology' in ''Symbolism, the Sacred, and the Arts. Continuum, 1992. {{ISBN|0826406181}}. p.99-100</ref>\n\nVisual representation of the axis mundi in contemporary art is currently being achieved by photographer Jennifer Westjohn.  By the process of mirror symmetry of a single photograph the artist exposes an entirely new image: the 5th point.  The viewer is then introduced to a coalescing of nature and the universe which lends new perspective to the original image.  This artistic representation of axis mundi opens the mind up to a new visual dimension both energistic and shamanic.<ref>Jennifer Westjohn.

He is shown as the farm's most dedicated and loyal  laborer. Boxer serves as an [[allegory]] for the [[Russian people|Russian]] working-class who helped to oust [[Tsar]] [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas]] and establish the [[Soviet Union]], but were eventually betrayed by the [[History of the Soviet Union (1927\u20131953)|Bolsheviks]].\n\nHe is described as \"faithful and strong\";<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=30047391|pages=17\u201319|last1=Sutherland|first1=T.|title=Speaking My Mind: Orwell Farmed for Education|volume=95|issue=1|journal=The English Journal|year=2005}}</ref> and he believes any problem can be solved if he works harder.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=40176954|pages=11\u201363|last1=Roper|first1=D.|title=Viewpoint 2: The Boxer Mentality|volume=9|issue=11|journal=Change|year=1977|doi=10.1080/00091383.1977.10569271}}</ref>\n\nBoxer can only remember four letters of the alphabet at a time, but sees the importance of education and aspires to learn the rest of the alphabet during his retirement (which never happens). Boxer is a loyal supporter of [[Napoleon (Animal Farm)|Napoleon]], and he listens to everything the self-appointed ruler of the farm says and assumes, sometimes with doubt, that everything Napoleon tells the farm animals is true, hence \"Napoleon is always right.\"\n\nBoxer's strength plays a huge part in keeping Animal Farm together prior to his death: the rest of the animals trusted in it to keep their spirits high during the long and hard laborious winters. Boxer was the only close friend of [[Benjamin (Animal Farm)|Benjamin]], the cynical donkey.\n\nBoxer fights in the Battle of the Cowshed and the Battle of the Windmill. Though he dislikes humans, he kicks a stable boy during a fight and kills him, which Boxer hates himself for doing, thinking that went too far (shortly afterwards it revealed the boy was only stunned, and soon fled to freedom). When Boxer defends [[Snowball (Animal Farm)|Snowball]]'s reputation from [[Squealer (Animal Farm)|Squealer]]'s [[Historical revisionism|revisionism]], [[Animal Farm#Pigs|the pigs]] designate him as a target for the [[Great Purge]]. However, when the dogs attack, Boxer pins one under his hooves, causing the other dogs to flee and the captured dog to be spared at Napoleon's request. When he collapses from overwork, the pigs say they have sent him to a [[veterinarian]], when they actually have sent him to the [[knacker]]'s yard to be slaughtered, in exchange for money to buy a case of whiskey for the pigs to drink. Benjamin, who is described as \"devoted to Boxer,\" recognizes that the dogcart that Boxer is taken away in is the knacker's; however, Squealer deceives the other animals by saying that the dogcart was possessed by a veterinarian who failed to repaint the dogcart. Squealer concocts a sentimental tale of the death of Boxer, saying that he was given the best medical care possible, paid for by the \"compassionate\" Napoleon.

He is shown as the farm's most dedicated and loyal  laborer. Boxer serves as an [[allegory]] for the [[Russian people|Russian]] working-class who helped to oust [[Tsar]] [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas]] and establish the [[Soviet Union]], but were eventually betrayed by the [[History of the Soviet Union (1927\u20131953)|Bolsheviks]].\n\nBoxer is compassionate and dimwitted. He is described as \"faithful and strong\";<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=30047391|pages=17\u201319|last1=Sutherland|first1=T.|title=Speaking My Mind: Orwell Farmed for Education|volume=95|issue=1|journal=The English Journal|year=2005}}</ref> and he believes any problem can be solved if he works harder.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=40176954|pages=11\u201363|last1=Roper|first1=D.|title=Viewpoint 2: The Boxer Mentality|volume=9|issue=11|journal=Change|year=1977|doi=10.1080/00091383.1977.10569271}}</ref>\n\nBoxer can only remember four letters of the alphabet at a time, but sees the importance of education and aspires to learn the rest of the alphabet during his retirement (which never happens). Boxer is a loyal supporter of [[Napoleon (Animal Farm)|Napoleon]], and he listens to everything the self-appointed ruler of the farm says and assumes, sometimes with doubt, that everything Napoleon tells the farm animals is true, hence \"Napoleon is always right.\"\n\nBoxer's strength plays a huge part in keeping Animal Farm together prior to his death: the rest of the animals trusted in it to keep their spirits high during the long and hard laborious winters. Boxer was the only close friend of [[Benjamin (Animal Farm)|Benjamin]], the cynical donkey.\n\nBoxer fights in the Battle of the Cowshed and the Battle of the Windmill. Though he dislikes humans, he kicks a stable boy during a fight and kills him, which Boxer hates himself for doing, thinking that went too far (shortly afterwards it revealed the boy was only stunned, and soon fled to freedom). When Boxer defends [[Snowball (Animal Farm)|Snowball]]'s reputation from [[Squealer (Animal Farm)|Squealer]]'s [[Historical revisionism|revisionism]], [[Animal Farm#Pigs|the pigs]] designate him as a target for the [[Great Purge]]. However, when the dogs attack, Boxer pins one under his hooves, causing the other dogs to flee and the captured dog to be spared at Napoleon's request. When he collapses from overwork, the pigs say they have sent him to a [[veterinarian]], when they actually have sent him to the [[knacker]]'s yard to be slaughtered, in exchange for money to buy a case of whiskey for the pigs to drink. Benjamin, who is described as \"devoted to Boxer,\" recognizes that the dogcart that Boxer is taken away in is the knacker's; however, Squealer deceives the other animals by saying that the dogcart was possessed by a veterinarian who failed to repaint the dogcart. Squealer concocts a sentimental tale of the death of Boxer, saying that he was given the best medical care possible, paid for by the \"compassionate\" Napoleon. Boxer's death is turned into a day of honoring him, and Squealer says that his sayings, \"Comrade Napoleon is always right\" and \"I will work harder!\" should live on in all the animals; ergo another excuse to make the animals work even harder.\n\nDuring [[Old Major]]'s speech, which inspired the principles of [[Animalism (Animal Farm)|Animalism]], a specific reference is made to how Boxer would be turned into glue under [[Jones (Animal Farm)|Farmer Jones]]' rule, thus implying that it would not happen to him under Animalism. \"You, Boxer, the very day that those great muscles of yours lose their power, Jones will send you to the knacker, he will cut your throat and boil you down for the fox-hounds.\"<ref>Chapter I p. 9, Signet Classics edition</ref>\n\n==Real life model==\nBoxer is based on a coal miner named [[Alexey Stakhanov]] who was famous for working over his quota.

Abbott has been the [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Hackney North and Stoke Newington (UK Parliament constituency)|Hackney North and Stoke Newington]] since [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987]]. As a member of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], she has held various positions in successive [[Shadow Cabinet]]s; she was the country's first black female MP and is the longest serving black MP in the House of Commons.\n\nBorn in [[Paddington]] to a [[British Jamaican]] family, Abbott studied History at [[Newnham College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]]. She worked in the civil service and as a reporter for [[Thames Television]] and [[TV-am]] before becoming a press officer for the [[Greater London Council]]. Joining Labour, she was elected to [[Westminster City Council]] in 1982 and then as an MP in 1987. She would be re-elected in the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992]], [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997]], [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]], [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005]], [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010]], [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]], [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017]] and [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019]] general elections. She has faced disproportionate sexism and racism as a public figure, individually receiving almost half of all abuse directed at women MPs in the 2017 election campaign.<ref name=\"Independent Amnesty\"/>\n\nCritical of [[Tony Blair]]'s [[New Labour]] project which pushed the party to [[centrism|the centre]] during the 1990s, in the House of Commons Abbott voted against several Blairite policies, including the launching of the [[Iraq War]] and the [[Identity Cards Act 2006|proposed introduction of ID cards]]. She stood for [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party leader]] on a leftist platform in [[2010 Labour Party leadership election (UK)|2010]], although lost to [[Ed Miliband]], who appointed her [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Shadow Minister for Public Health]].\n\nAbbott supported [[Jeremy Corbyn]]'s bid to become Labour leader in 2015. After he succeeded, she became [[Shadow Secretary of State for International Development]], then [[Shadow Health Secretary]], and eventually [[Shadow Home Secretary]]. As a key Corbyn ally, she supported his leftward push in the party. She unsuccessfully attempted to be the Labour candidate for the [[2016 London mayoral election]], and backed the unsuccessful [[Britain Stronger in Europe]] campaign to [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|retain UK membership]] of the [[European Union]].\n\n==Early life and career==\nAbbott was born to [[Jamaica]]n parents in [[Paddington]], London, in 1953.

Abbott in 2017\n}}\n'''Diane Julie Abbott''' (born 27 September 1953) is a British politician who served as the [[Shadow Home Secretary]] in the [[Shadow Cabinet of Jeremy Corbyn]] from 2016 to 2020. Abbott has been the [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Hackney North and Stoke Newington (UK Parliament constituency)|Hackney North and Stoke Newington]] since [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987]]. As a member of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], she has held various positions in successive [[Shadow Cabinet]]s; she was the country's first black female MP and is the longest serving black MP in the House of Commons.\n\nBorn in [[Paddington]] to a [[British Jamaican]] family, Abbott studied History at [[Newnham College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]]. She worked in the civil service and as a reporter for [[Thames Television]] and [[TV-am]] before becoming a press officer for the [[Greater London Council]]. Joining Labour, she was elected to [[Westminster City Council]] in 1982 and then as an MP in 1987. She would be re-elected in the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992]], [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997]], [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]], [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005]], [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010]], [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]], [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017]] and [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019]] general elections. She has faced disproportionate sexism and racism as a public figure, individually receiving almost half of all abuse directed at women MPs in the 2017 election campaign.<ref name=\"Independent Amnesty\"/>\n\nCritical of [[Tony Blair]]'s [[New Labour]] project which pushed the party to [[centrism|the centre]] during the 1990s, in the House of Commons Abbott voted against several Blairite policies, including the launching of the [[Iraq War]] and the [[Identity Cards Act 2006|proposed introduction of ID cards]]. She stood for [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party leader]] on a leftist platform in [[2010 Labour Party leadership election (UK)|2010]], although lost to [[Ed Miliband]], who appointed her [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Shadow Minister for Public Health]].\n\nAbbott supported [[Jeremy Corbyn]]'s bid to become Labour leader in 2015. After he succeeded, she became [[Shadow Secretary of State for International Development]], then [[Shadow Health Secretary]], and eventually [[Shadow Home Secretary]]. As a key Corbyn ally, she supported his leftward push in the party. She unsuccessfully attempted to be the Labour candidate for the [[2016 London mayoral election]], and backed the unsuccessful [[Britain Stronger in Europe]] campaign to [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|retain UK membership]] of the [[European Union]].\n\n==Early life and career==\nAbbott was born to [[Jamaica]]n parents in [[Paddington]], London, in 1953.
