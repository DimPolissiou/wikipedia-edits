{"title_page": "Bangka Belitung Islands", "text_new": "{{short description|Province of Indonesia}}\nThe '''Bangka Belitung Islands''' ({{lang-id|Kepulauan Bangka Belitung}}) is a [[Provinces of Indonesia|province]] of [[Indonesia]]. Situated off the southeastern coast of [[Sumatra]], the province comprises two main islands, [[Bangka Island|Bangka]] and [[Belitung]], and several smaller ones. Bangka Belitung is bordered by the [[Bangka Strait]] to the west, the [[Natuna Sea]] to the north, the [[Java Sea]] is to the south, and the [[Karimata Strait]] to the east. The province's capital and largest city is [[Pangkal Pinang]]. As of the 2015 census, the population of Bangka Belitung was 1,372,813.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name \"Bangka\" is derived from the word ''wangka'' (\u0935\u0928\u094d\u091a 'vanca') meaning \"tin\" in [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]], because this region is indeed rich in tin mining. The name \"Wangka\" first appeared along with the name \"[[Suvarnabhumi|Swarnabhumi]]\" in the Indian literary book Milindrapantha from the 1st Century BC. Swarnabhumi is identified as the island of [[Sumatra]], the strong allegation that the so-called \"Wangka\" is the island of Bangka. [[Louis-Charles Damais]], in his book ''Epigraphy and History of the Nusantara'', affirms that Bangka comes from the word vowel (vanca).\n\nThe name \"Belitung\" is derived from ''Billitonite'' meaning the Black Meteorite in Dutch, which is commonly found in the island of Belitung. This stone itself was discovered at the time of tin mining in Belitung. Later on, Dutch academics writing in East Indies publications began named the island ''Billitonite'' or Billiton. Nowadays, ''Billitonite'' or Black Meteorite, is a distinct souvenir from Belitung Island.\n\n==History==\nBangka Belitung is an area that has a unique range of cultures and languages. Just like other provinces in Indonesia, Bangka Belitung has served as European and Japanese colonies. Prior to the colonies era, Bangka Belitung has become part of several kingdoms in Sumatra and Java. [[Srivijaya|Sriwijaya]] and [[Majapahit]] are the kingdoms who settled Bangka Belitung to expand its power. \n[[File:Fort Toboali North Wall.png|thumb|The fort of [[Toboali]] was built in 1825 to defend Bangka's tin mines]]\nThe first Europeans arrived in Bangka was the English on 20 May 1812. However, with the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824]], English left Bangka Belitung, and the Dutch took over. Due to the agreement, the Dutch were able to take control of the Pacific Islands. However, there is a coup attempt by local \u00e9lite through Depati Barin and his son Depati Amir who was well known with the war of Depati Amir with wartime of about three years (1849-1851) to oppose the colonization in Bangka Belitung. Yet, this war was then won by the Dutch and that caused Depati Amir to be exiled to Kupang in East Nusa Tenggara. Therefore, Depati Amir became a national hero and her name was remembered through its regional airport, the [[Depati Amir Airport]].\n\nBangka Belitung has a long history with Chinese migration (mainly [[Hakka people]]). Chinese people in the 13th century had already started to migrate into the Bangka region. In the 17th century, the rulers of Palembang saw there was extraordinary potential which later they found tin mines in Belitung. The tin is the most reason why the Dutch decided to bring contract workers from mainland China that resettled in Belitung. The tin itself what helped drive the island's development and make it the place it is today. Since then, some of Chinese migrants have gone home while others decided to stay. The one who decided staying began assimilating with local people and is followed by intermarriages, they live coexisting peacefully in spite of differences in religion and ethnicity. When [[May 1998 riots of Indonesia|anti-Chinese riots]] occurred in some parts of Indonesia at the end of the [[Fall of Suharto|Soeharto regime in 1998]], the locals and those of Chinese descent not much concerned and still lived peacefully in the Bangka Belitung province.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/02/08/heaven-earth-bangka-belitung.html |title=Heaven on earth in Bangka Belitung |date=February 8, 2012}}</ref>\n\nBangka Belitung province is created as the 31st province by the Government of the Republic of Indonesia based on Law No. 27 of 2000 on the establishment of Bangka Belitung province which was part of the [[South Sumatra|South Sumatra province.]] The provincial capital is Pangkalpinang.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.babelprov.go.id/content/sekilas-sejarah|title=Provinsi Kepulauan Bangka Belitung - Bumi Serumpun Sebalai|website=www.babelprov.go.id|accessdate=19 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Weather and Climate ==\nIn 2007 the moisture in the Bangka Belitung Province ranged from 77.4% to 87.3% with an average monthly reach of 83.1%, with a rainfall of 58.3&nbsp;mm to 476.3&nbsp;mm and air pressure during 2007 approximately 1010.1 MBS.

The [[Orang Laut]] themselves came from various islands. Sea people from Belitung sail and inhabit the coast along the [[Malay Peninsula]], then returned to Bangka Island and Belitung Island. While those who live in Riau Islands sail to Bangka. There are also groups of Orang Laut from [[Sulawesi]] and [[Kalimantan]]. In the next wave, the [[Bugis people|Bugis]], who was originally from [[South Sulawesi]], came and settled in Bangka, Belitung and Riau. Then came the Johor Malay, Siantan Malay, Malay-Chinese, and also native Chinese, mingling in the process of acculturation and culture. Then came the Minangkabau, Javanese, Banjarese, Madurese, Acehnese and some other ethnic groups.\n\nThe [[Malay (ethnic group)|Malay]] is the largest ethnic group in the province. They form around 52.5%  of the total population. The Malays are mostly concentrated around the interior of Bangka and Belitung. The Malay are divided into the Bangka Malay and the Belitung Malay. These 2 group are slightly different ranging from their culture to their language. Most of the Malays works in either the farming industry or the fishing industry. The Malay in Bangka Belitung have a very distinct lifestyle compared to other Malay people, especially with those in [[Malaysia]]. Another group of Malay inhabiting Bangka Belitung is known as the [[Orang Laut]]. They inhabit the coastal part of the province and are usually nomadic, living in one place or another.\n\nThe second largest ethnic group is the [[Chinese Indonesian|Chinese]], forming around 29.1% of the total population. The Chinese are mostly concentrated in the coastal part of Bangka and Belitung or urban areas. The Chinese in Bangka Belitung are originally from [[Southern China]], especially the [[Guangdong]] province, migrating from the 18th century to the early 20th century to have a better job opportunities.  During the colonial era, most of the Chinese works in the mining industry as well as making their own business. Most of the Chinese in Bangka Belitung are [[Hakka people|Hakka]], while significant [[Hokkien people|Hokkien]] and [[Cantonese people|Cantonese]] community also exist. The Chinese culture in Bangka is slightly different from the Chinese in Belitung. The Chinese in Bangka were imported in the early 18th century when the mine was officially opened. They generally did not bring their wives to marry indigenous people, so the Chinese in Bangka are mostly peranakans who speak Hakka Language mixed with Malay.

Situated off the southeastern coast of [[Sumatra]], the province comprises two main islands, [[Bangka Island|Bangka]] and [[Belitung]], and several smaller ones. Bangka Belitung is bordered by the [[Bangka Strait]] to the west, the [[Natuna Sea]] to the north, the [[Java Sea]] is to the south, and the [[Karimata Strait]] to the east. The province's capital and largest city is [[Pangkal Pinang]]. As of the 2015 census, the population of Bangka Belitung was 1,372,813.\n\nThe province has an [[equatorial climate]] with tropical [[rainforest]]s, which however is disappearing due to deforestation. Mount Maras is the highest point in the province and the island of Bangka, with a height of 699 m. There are several rives in the province, such as the Sebuku River, Baturusa River and Mendo River. The province is ethnically, culturally, and linguistically diverse; major ethnic groups including [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]], [[Chinese Indonesians|Chinese]] and [[Javanese people|Javanese]]. [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] is the official language of the province, while the local [[Malay language|Malay dialect]] and [[Hakka language|Hakka]] serves as the [[lingua franca]] of the province.\n\nHistorically, Bangka Belitung alternated into the kingdoms of [[Sriwijaya]], [[Majapahit]] and [[Palembang Sultanate|Palembang]], before being a colony of foreign countries the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]], the [[British Empire|British]], and the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]]. Bangka Belitung was a [[Residency (country subdivision)|residency]] within the [[Dutch East Indies]]. Upon the independence of Indonesia, the region was administered under the province of Sumatra and South Sumatra. Bangka Belitung officially became the 31st province of Indonesia in 2000.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name \"Bangka\" is derived from the word ''wangka'' (\u0935\u0928\u094d\u091a 'vanca') meaning \"tin\" in [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]], because this region is indeed rich in tin mining. The name \"Wangka\" first appeared along with the name \"[[Suvarnabhumi|Swarnabhumi]]\" in the Indian literary book Milindrapantha from the 1st Century BC. Swarnabhumi is identified as the island of [[Sumatra]], the strong allegation that the so-called \"Wangka\" is the island of Bangka. [[Louis-Charles Damais]], in his book ''Epigraphy and History of the Nusantara'', affirms that Bangka comes from the word vowel (vanca).\n\nThe name \"Belitung\" is derived from ''Billitonite'' meaning the Black Meteorite in Dutch, which is commonly found in the island of Belitung. This stone itself was discovered at the time of tin mining in Belitung. Later on, Dutch academics writing in East Indies publications began named the island ''Billitonite'' or Billiton. Nowadays, ''Billitonite'' or Black Meteorite, is a distinct souvenir from Belitung Island.\n\n==History==\n{{Quote box |width=23em |align=left |bgcolor=#B0C4DE\n|title=Historical affiliations\n|fontsize=90% |quote=\n{{flagicon image|Naval Jack of Indonesia.svg}} [[Majapahit Empire]] 14th century-1527<br />\n{{flagicon image|F1 white flag.svg}} Sultanate of Palembang 1527-1722<br />\n{{flagicon image|Flag_of_the_Dutch_East_India_Company.svg}} [[Dutch East India Company]] 1722-1799<br />\n{{flagicon image|Flag of the United Kingdom.svg}} [[United Kingdom]] 1812-1824<br />\n{{flagicon image|Flag of the Netherlands.svg}} [[Dutch East Indies]] 1799\u20131812; 1824\u20131942<br />\n{{flagicon image|Flag of Japan (1870-1999).svg}} [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies|Empire of Japan]] 1942\u20131945<br />\n{{flag|Indonesia}} 1945\u2013present\n}}\nBangka Belitung is an area that has a unique range of cultures and languages. Just like other provinces in Indonesia, Bangka Belitung has served as European and Japanese colonies. Prior to the colonies era, Bangka Belitung has become part of several kingdoms in Sumatra and Java. [[Srivijaya|Sriwijaya]] and [[Majapahit]] are the kingdoms who settled Bangka Belitung to expand its power. \n[[File:Fort Toboali North Wall.png|thumb|The fort of [[Toboali]] was built in 1825 to defend Bangka's tin mines]]\nThe first Europeans arrived in Bangka was the English on 20 May 1812. However, with the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824]], English left Bangka Belitung, and the Dutch took over. Due to the agreement, the Dutch were able to take control of the Pacific Islands. However, there is a coup attempt by local \u00e9lite through Depati Barin and his son Depati Amir who was well known with the war of Depati Amir with wartime of about three years (1849-1851) to oppose the colonization in Bangka Belitung. Yet, this war was then won by the Dutch and that caused Depati Amir to be exiled to Kupang in East Nusa Tenggara. Therefore, Depati Amir became a national hero and her name was remembered through its regional airport, the [[Depati Amir Airport]].\n\nBangka Belitung has a long history with Chinese migration (mainly [[Hakka people]]). Chinese people in the 13th century had already started to migrate into the Bangka region. In the 17th century, the rulers of Palembang saw there was extraordinary potential which later they found tin mines in Belitung. The tin is the most reason why the Dutch decided to bring contract workers from mainland China that resettled in Belitung. The tin itself what helped drive the island's development and make it the place it is today. Since then, some of Chinese migrants have gone home while others decided to stay. The one who decided staying began assimilating with local people and is followed by intermarriages, they live coexisting peacefully in spite of differences in religion and ethnicity. When [[May 1998 riots of Indonesia|anti-Chinese riots]] occurred in some parts of Indonesia at the end of the [[Fall of Suharto|Soeharto regime in 1998]], the locals and those of Chinese descent not much concerned and still lived peacefully in the Bangka Belitung province.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/02/08/heaven-earth-bangka-belitung.html |title=Heaven on earth in Bangka Belitung |date=February 8, 2012}}</ref>\n\nBangka Belitung province is created as the 31st province by the Government of the Republic of Indonesia based on Law No. 27 of 2000 on the establishment of Bangka Belitung province which was part of the [[South Sumatra|South Sumatra province.]] The provincial capital is Pangkalpinang.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.babelprov.go.id/content/sekilas-sejarah|title=Provinsi Kepulauan Bangka Belitung - Bumi Serumpun Sebalai|website=www.babelprov.go.id|accessdate=19 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Weather and Climate ==\nIn 2007 the moisture in the Bangka Belitung Province ranged from 77.4% to 87.3% with an average monthly reach of 83.1%, with a rainfall of 58.3&nbsp;mm to 476.3&nbsp;mm and air pressure during 2007 approximately 1010.1 MBS.

The average household size was 2.76 and the average family size was 3.21.\n\nIn the county, the population was spread out with 28.60% under the age of 18, 9.60% from 18 to 24, 27.90% from 25 to 44, 21.40% from 45 to 64, and 12.40% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 34 years. For every 100 females there were 94.40 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 90.10 males.\n\nThe median income for a household in the county was $26,686, and the median income for a family was $31,487. Males had a median income of $26,406 versus $18,459 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the county was $14,013. About 16.50% of families and 20.70% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 26.80% of those under age 18 and 22.70% of those age 65 or over.\n\n==Government==\nThe Scott County Sheriff's office provides the equivalent of County law enforcement for both unincorporated cities as well as incorporated cities within the county. The Scott County Sheriff is the oldest elected position in Scott County. The Scott County Sheriff's Office has 63 employees, both sworn and non-sworn. {{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} It is divided into six divisions; Administration, patrol, criminal investigations,narcotics, communications, and detention. The Sheriff's office operates the County Jail; it provides detention services under contract to the City of Forest Police Department and to the [[Mississippi Department of Corrections]].\n\nIn 2010 the County opened a new state-of-the-art correction facility. The facility can handle 150 prisoners. The complex includes a new sheriff's office. The new sheriff's provides offices for all administrative personnel as well as investigations offices. {{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\n===Class-action suit against court and Sheriff's Office===\nIn September 2014 the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) and the [[MacArthur Justice Center]] filed a federal class-action civil rights suit, ''Burks v. Scott County,'' against the County courts and the Scott County Sheriff's Office for violating suspects' rights, under the Sixth and Fourteenth amendments, to 1) defense counsel, 2) a speedy trial, 3) individualized bail determinations; and 4) freedom from excessive pre-trial detention.\n\nThe two plaintiffs had each been held for months in detention without access to a public defender before they were indicted or tried on the charges. \"... Mr. Burks has spent over three years in the Scott County jail since August 30, 2009, on the three separate charges,\" the complaint states. \"He has only been indicted once, he has never been to trial, and he has never been convicted.\"<ref name=\"salon\">[http://www.salon.com/2014/09/24/challenging_mississippis_depraved_justice_system_months_in_jail_with_no_indictment_and_no_lawyer/ Karen Houpper, \"Challenging Mississippi\u2019s depraved justice system: Months in jail, with no indictment and no lawyer\"], ''Salon'', 23 September 2014; accessed 17 March 2017</ref>\n\nThe state does not require the county courts to issue indictments within any set period of time. The county courts call a grand jury only three times a year, so defendants have long waits in between.  At the time of indictment, the Scott County judges pick the public defender for each defendant, creating a conflict of interest. The ACLU notes that similar abuses exist in other Mississippi county court systems.<ref name=\"salon\"/>\nAt the time of the suit, Brandon Buskey, a lawyer with the A.C.L.U.'s Criminal Law Reform Project, said that 53 of the 129 inmates in the Scott County Detention Center had not been indicted.<ref name=\"nyt\">[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/25/us/in-a-mississippi-jail-convictions-and-counsel-appear-optional.html?action=click&contentCollection=U.S.&module=RelatedCoverage&region=EndOfArticle&pgtype=article CAMPBELL ROBERTSON, \"In a Mississippi Jail, Convictions and Counsel Appear Optional\"], 24 September 2014; accessed 17 March 2017</ref>\n\nOn September 23, 2014 these parties filed a federal class action lawsuit on behalf of several inmates in the Scott County Detention Center who had been detained for lengthy periods without counsel, fair bail arrangements, formal prosecution, or trial. They proposed the creation of three classes of plaintiffs, among persons who were treated similarly by the county courts.<ref name=RobertsonC/>\n\nAs of November 2015, the case was ongoing. The US District Court dismissed the plaintiff's motion for a declaratory judgment in September 2015. It retained the claim for damages by the two named plaintiffs but dismissed the motions to certify three classes as [[Mootness|moot]], saying that defendants could bring up the claimed issues above with the county judges before indictment. The plaintiffs were thus denied class status by the court.<ref name=clearinghouse-15059>{{cite web|website=[[Civil Rights Litigation Clearinghouse]]|title=Burks v.

The racial makeup of the county was 53.3% [[Race (United States Census)|White]], 37.5% [[Race (United States Census)|Black]] or [[Race (United States Census)|African American]], 0.31% [[Race (United States Census)|Native American]], 0.2% [[Race (United States Census)|Asian]], 0.2% [[Race (United States Census)|Pacific Islander]], 7.2% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 1.4% from two or more races. 10.7% of the population were [[Race (United States Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Race (United States Census)|Latino]] (6.3% [[Mexican American|Mexican]], 1.5% [[Guatemalan American|Guatemalan]], 0.7% [[Cuban American|Cuban]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=DEC_10_DP_DPDP1&prodType=table|archive-url=https://archive.today/20190521214830/https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=DEC_10_DP_DPDP1&prodType=table|url-status=dead|archive-date=2019-05-21|title=American FactFinder - Results|last=Bureau|first=U.S. Census|website=factfinder2.census.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-03-04}}</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20010512121042/http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/28/28123.html]</ref>\n\nThere were 10,183 households out of which 36.20% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 49.80% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 18.80% had a female householder with no husband present, and 26.00% were non-families. 22.20% of all households were made up of individuals and 10.00% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.76 and the average family size was 3.21.\n\nIn the county, the population was spread out with 28.60% under the age of 18, 9.60% from 18 to 24, 27.90% from 25 to 44, 21.40% from 45 to 64, and 12.40% who were 65 years of age or older.

The Scott County Sheriff is the oldest elected position in Scott County. The Scott County Sheriff's Office has 63 employees, both sworn and non-sworn. {{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} It is divided into six divisions; Administration, patrol, criminal investigations,narcotics, communications, and detention. The Sheriff's office operates the County Jail; it provides detention services under contract to the City of Forest Police Department and to the [[Mississippi Department of Corrections]].\n\nIn 2010 the County opened a new state-of-the-art correction facility. The facility can handle 150 prisoners. The complex includes a new sheriff's office. The new sheriff's provides offices for all administrative personnel as well as investigations offices. {{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\n===Class-action suit against court and Sheriff's Office===\nIn September 2014 the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) and the [[MacArthur Justice Center]] filed a federal class-action civil rights suit, ''Burks v. Scott County,'' against the County courts and the Scott County Sheriff's Office for violating suspects' rights, under the Sixth and Fourteenth amendments, to 1) defense counsel, 2) a speedy trial, 3) individualized bail determinations; and 4) freedom from excessive pre-trial detention.\n\nThe two plaintiffs had each been held for months in detention without access to a public defender before they were indicted or tried on the charges. \"... Mr. Burks has spent over three years in the Scott County jail since August 30, 2009, on the three separate charges,\" the complaint states. \"He has only been indicted once, he has never been to trial, and he has never been convicted.\"<ref name=\"salon\">[http://www.salon.com/2014/09/24/challenging_mississippis_depraved_justice_system_months_in_jail_with_no_indictment_and_no_lawyer/ Karen Houpper, \"Challenging Mississippi\u2019s depraved justice system: Months in jail, with no indictment and no lawyer\"], ''Salon'', 23 September 2014; accessed 17 March 2017</ref>\n\nThe state does not require the county courts to issue indictments within any set period of time. The county courts call a grand jury only three times a year, so defendants have long waits in between.  At the time of indictment, the Scott County judges pick the public defender for each defendant, creating a conflict of interest. The ACLU notes that similar abuses exist in other Mississippi county court systems.<ref name=\"salon\"/>\nAt the time of the suit, Brandon Buskey, a lawyer with the A.C.L.U.'s Criminal Law Reform Project, said that 53 of the 129 inmates in the Scott County Detention Center had not been indicted.<ref name=\"nyt\">[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/25/us/in-a-mississippi-jail-convictions-and-counsel-appear-optional.html?action=click&contentCollection=U.S.&module=RelatedCoverage&region=EndOfArticle&pgtype=article CAMPBELL ROBERTSON, \"In a Mississippi Jail, Convictions and Counsel Appear Optional\"], 24 September 2014; accessed 17 March 2017</ref>\n\nOn September 23, 2014 these parties filed a federal class action lawsuit on behalf of several inmates in the Scott County Detention Center who had been detained for lengthy periods without counsel, fair bail arrangements, formal prosecution, or trial. They proposed the creation of three classes of plaintiffs, among persons who were treated similarly by the county courts.<ref name=RobertsonC/>\n\nAs of November 2015, the case was ongoing. The US District Court dismissed the plaintiff's motion for a declaratory judgment in September 2015. It retained the claim for damages by the two named plaintiffs but dismissed the motions to certify three classes as [[Mootness|moot]], saying that defendants could bring up the claimed issues above with the county judges before indictment. The plaintiffs were thus denied class status by the court.<ref name=clearinghouse-15059>{{cite web|website=[[Civil Rights Litigation Clearinghouse]]|title=Burks v.
