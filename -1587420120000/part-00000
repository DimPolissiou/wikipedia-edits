The most scientifically corroborated theory by Panamanian linguists, states that the word is a [[hispanicization]] of [[Kuna language]] word \"''bannaba''\" which means \"distant\" or \"far away\".<ref name=PAN>{{cite web|url=http://www.pa/secciones/informacion/significado.html |title=Origen del Nombre Panam\u00e1 |publisher=Rep\u00fablica de Panam\u00e1 |accessdate=July 25, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070214054429/http://www.pa/secciones/informacion/significado.html |archivedate=February 14, 2007}}</ref>\n\nA commonly relayed legend in Panama is that there was a fishing village that bore the name \"Panam\u00e1\", which purportedly meant \"an abundance of fish\", when the Spanish colonizers first landed in the area. The exact location of the village is unknown. The legend is usually corroborated by Captain Antonio Tello de Guzm\u00e1n's diary entries, who reports landing at an unnamed village while exploring the Pacific coast of Panama in 1515; he only describes the village as a \"same small indigenous fishing town\". In 1517, Don [[Gaspar de Espinosa]], a Spanish lieutenant, decided to settle a post in the same location Guzm\u00e1n described. In 1519, [[Pedrarias D\u00e1vila]] decided to establish the Spanish Empire's Pacific port at the site. The new settlement replaced [[Santa Mar\u00eda La Antigua del Dari\u00e9n]], which had lost its function within the Crown's global plan after the Spanish exploitation of the riches in the Pacific began.\n\nThe official definition and origin of the name as promoted by Panama's Ministry of Education is the \"abundance of fish, trees and butterflies\".

Later central Panama was home to some of the first [[pottery]]-making in the Americas, for example the cultures at [[Monagrillo (archaeological site)|Monagrillo]], which date back to 2500\u20131700 BC. These evolved into significant populations best known through their spectacular burials (dating to c. 500\u2013900 AD) at the [[Monagrillo (archaeological site)|Monagrillo]] [[archaeological site]], and their beautiful [[Gran Cocl\u00e9]] style [[polychrome pottery]]. The monumental [[monolith]]ic sculptures at the [[Barriles]] (Chiriqui) site are also important traces of these ancient isthmian cultures.\n\nBefore Europeans arrived Panama was widely settled by [[Chibchan]], [[Chocoan]], and [[Cueva people|Cueva]] peoples. The largest group were the Cueva (whose specific language affiliation is poorly documented). The size of the [[Indigenous people of the Americas|indigenous]] population of the isthmus at the time of European colonization is uncertain. Estimates range as high as two million people, but more recent studies place that number closer to 200,000. Archaeological finds and testimonials by early European explorers describe diverse native isthmian groups exhibiting cultural variety and suggesting people developed{{clarify|date=August 2016|reason=Is this an anthropological term?}} by regular regional routes of commerce.\n\nWhen Panama was colonized, the indigenous peoples fled into the forest and nearby islands. Scholars believe that [[infectious disease]] was the primary cause of the population decline of American natives. The indigenous peoples had no [[acquired immunity]] to diseases which had been chronic in Eurasian populations for centuries.<ref>Hays, J. N. (2005).

A year later, [[Christopher Columbus]] visited the isthmus, and established a short-lived settlement in the [[Dari\u00e9n Province|Darien]]. [[Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa]]'s tortuous trek from the Atlantic to the Pacific in 1513 demonstrated that the isthmus was indeed the path between the seas, and Panama quickly became the crossroads and marketplace of Spain's empire in the [[New World]]. Gold and silver were brought by ship from South America, hauled across the isthmus, and loaded aboard ships for Spain. The route became known as the Camino Real, or Royal Road, although it was more commonly known as Camino de Cruces (Road of Crosses) because of the number of gravesites along the way.\n\nPanama was under [[Spanish Empire|Spanish rule]] for almost 300 years (1538\u20131821), and became part of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]], along with all other Spanish possessions in South America. From the outset, Panamanian identity was based on a sense of \"geographic destiny\", and Panamanian fortunes fluctuated with the geopolitical importance of the isthmus. The colonial experience spawned Panamanian nationalism and a racially complex and highly stratified society, the source of internal conflicts that ran counter to the unifying force of nationalism.<ref>{{Cite book|title=La inmigraci\u00f3n prohibida en Panam\u00e1 y sus prejuicios raciales|last=Arango Durling |trans-title=Prohibited immigration in Panam\u00e1 and its racial prejudices |first=Virginia |publisher=Publipan |year=1999 |lccn=2001388757 |location=Panam\u00e1  |language=Spanish |pages=}}</ref>{{page needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nIn 1538 the [[Real Audiencia of Panama]] was established, initially with [[jurisdiction]] from Nicaragua to [[Cape Horn]], until the conquest of Peru. A Real Audiencia was a judicial district that functioned as an appeals court. Each audiencia had an ''[[oidor]]'' (Spanish: hearer, a judge).\n\nSpanish authorities had little control over much of the territory of Panama. Large sections managed to resist conquest and missionization until very late in the colonial era. Because of this, indigenous people of the area were often referred to as \"indios de guerra\" (war Indians) who resisted Spanish attempts to conquer them or missionize them.  However, Panama was enormously important to Spain strategically because it was the easiest way to transship silver mined in Peru to Europe.  Silver cargoes were landed at Panama and then taken overland to [[Portobelo, Col\u00f3n|Portobello]] or [[Nombre de Dios, Col\u00f3n|Nombre de Dios]] on the Caribbean side of the isthmus for further shipment.\n\nBecause of incomplete Spanish control, the Panama route was vulnerable to attack from pirates (mostly Dutch and English), and from \"new world\" Africans called [[cimarron people (Panama)|cimarrons]] who had freed themselves from enslavement and lived in communes or ''palenques'' around the Camino Real in Panama's Interior, and on some of the islands off Panama's Pacific coast. One such famous community amounted to a small kingdom under [[Bayano]], which emerged in the 1552 to 1558. Sir [[Francis Drake]]'s famous raids on Panama in 1572\u201373 and [[John Oxenham]]'s crossing to the [[Pacific Ocean]] were aided by Panama cimarrons, and Spanish authorities were only able to bring them under control by making an alliance with them that guaranteed their freedom in exchange for military support in 1582.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Pike, Ruth |title=Black Rebels: Cimarrons in Sixteenth Century Panama|journal=The Americas|volume= 64|issue=2 |year=2007|pages= 243\u201366|doi=10.1353/tam.2007.0161}}</ref>\n\nThe prosperity enjoyed during the first two centuries (1540\u20131740) while contributing to colonial growth; the placing of extensive regional judicial authority (Real Audiencia) as part of its jurisdiction; and the pivotal role it played at the height of the Spanish Empire \u2013 the first modern global empire \u2013 helped define a distinctive sense of autonomy and of regional or national identity within Panama well before the rest of the colonies.\n\nThe end of the [[encomienda]] system in [[Azuero Peninsula|Azuero]], however, sparked the conquest of [[Veraguas]] in that same year. Under the leadership of Francisco V\u00e1zquez, the region of Veraguas passed into Castilian rule in 1558. In the newly conquered region, the old system of encomienda was imposed. On the other hand, the Panamanian movement for independence can be indirectly attributed to the abolition of the encomienda system in the [[Azuero Peninsula]], set forth by the Spanish Crown, in 1558 because of repeated protests by locals against the mistreatment of the native population. In its stead, a system of medium and smaller-sized landownership was promoted, thus taking away the power from the large landowners and into the hands of medium and small-sized proprietors.\n\nPanama was the site of the ill-fated [[Darien scheme]], which set up a [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scottish]] colony in the region in 1698. This failed for a number of reasons, and the ensuing debt contributed to the [[Acts of Union 1707|union]] of England and Scotland in 1707.<ref>\"[http://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/Scotland-History/DarienScheme.htm The Darien Scheme \u2013 The Fall of Scotland] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205194052/http://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/Scotland-History/DarienScheme.htm |date=February 5, 2012 }}\", Historic UK</ref>\n\nIn 1671, the [[privateer]] [[Henry Morgan]], licensed by the English government, sacked and burned the city of [[Panam\u00e1 Viejo|Panama]] \u2013 the second most important city in the Spanish New World at the time. In 1717 the [[viceroyalty of New Granada]] (northern South America) was created in response to other Europeans trying to take Spanish territory in the Caribbean region. The Isthmus of Panama was placed under its jurisdiction. However, the remoteness of New Granada's capital, [[Santa Fe de Bogot\u00e1]] (the modern capital of [[Colombia]]) proved a greater obstacle than the Spanish crown anticipated as the authority of New Granada was contested by the seniority, closer proximity, and previous ties to the viceroyalty of Lima and even by Panama's own initiative. This uneasy relationship between Panama and Bogot\u00e1 would persist for centuries.\n\nIn 1744, Bishop Francisco Javier de Luna Victoria DeCastro established the College of San Ignacio de Loyola and on June 3, 1749, founded La Real y Pontificia Universidad de San Javier. By this time, however, Panama's importance and influence had become insignificant as Spain's power dwindled in Europe and advances in navigation technique increasingly permitted ships to round Cape Horn in order to reach the Pacific. While the Panama route was short it was also labor-intensive and expensive because of the loading and unloading and laden-down trek required to get from the one coast to the other.\n\n====1800s====\n\n[[File:Arco chato.jpg|thumb|[[Santo Domingo Church]]]]\nAs the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] were heating up all across Latin America, Panama City was preparing for independence; however, their plans were accelerated by the unilateral Grito de La Villa de Los Santos (Cry From the Town of Saints), issued on November 10, 1821, by the residents of [[province|Azuero]] without backing from Panama City to declare their separation from the Spanish Empire. In both [[Veraguas]] and the capital this act was met with disdain, although on differing levels. To Veraguas, it was the ultimate act of treason, while to the capital, it was seen as inefficient and irregular, and furthermore forced them to accelerate their plans.\n\nNevertheless, the Grito was a sign, on the part of the residents of Azuero, of their antagonism toward the independence movement in the capital. Those in the capital region in turn regarded the Azueran movement with contempt, since the separatists in Panama City believed that their counterparts in Azuero were fighting not only for independence from Spain, but also for their right to self-rule apart from Panama City once the Spaniards were gone.\n\nIt was seen as a risky move on the part of Azuero, which lived in fear of Colonel [[History of Panama#Jos\u00e9 de F\u00e1brega|Jos\u00e9 Pedro Antonio de F\u00e1brega y de las Cuevas]] (1774\u20131841). The colonel was a staunch loyalist and had all of the isthmus' military supplies in his hands. They feared quick retaliation and swift retribution against the separatists.\n\nWhat they had counted on, however, was the influence of the separatists in the capital. Ever since October 1821, when the former Governor General, [[Juan de la Cruz Murge\u00f3n]], left the isthmus on a campaign in [[Quito]] and left a colonel in charge, the separatists had been slowly converting F\u00e1brega to the separatist side. So, by November 10, F\u00e1brega was now a supporter of the independence movement. Soon after the separatist declaration of Los Santos, F\u00e1brega convened every organization in the capital with separatist interests and formally declared the city's support for independence. No military repercussions occurred because of skillful bribing of royalist troops.\n\n===Post-colonial Panama===\n[[File:Panama canal cartooon 1903.jpg|thumb|1903 political cartoon.

Perez Balladares worked skillfully during the campaign to rehabilitate the PRD's image, emphasizing the party's populist Torrijos roots rather than its association with Noriega. He won the election with only 33 percent of the vote when the major non-PRD forces splintered into competing factions.

It mostly lies between latitudes [[7th parallel north|7\u00b0]] and [[10th parallel north|10\u00b0N]], and longitudes [[77th meridian west|77\u00b0]] and [[83rd meridian west|83\u00b0W]] (a small area lies west of 83\u00b0).\n\nIts location on the [[Isthmus of Panama]] is strategic. By 2000, Panama controlled the [[Panama Canal]] which connects the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea to the North of the Pacific Ocean.  Panama's total area is 74,177.3&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.<ref name=area>{{cite web |url=https://www.contraloria.gob.pa/inec/archivos/P6221DATOS%20GENERALES%20%20%20%202013.pdf |title=Datos generales e hist\u00f3ricos de la Rep\u00fablica de Panam\u00e1 |language=es |publisher=[[National Institute of Statistics and Census of Panama|INEC]] |accessdate=December 22, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe dominant feature of Panama's geography is the central spine of mountains and hills that forms the [[continental divide]]. The divide does not form part of the great mountain chains of North America, and only near the Colombian border are there highlands related to the [[Andes|Andean]] system of South America. The spine that forms the divide is the highly eroded arch of an uplift from the sea bottom, in which peaks were formed by volcanic intrusions.\n\nThe mountain range of the divide is called the [[Cordillera de Talamanca]] near the Costa Rican border. Farther east it becomes the Serran\u00eda de Tabasar\u00e1, and the portion of it closer to the lower saddle of the isthmus, where the Panama Canal is located, is often called the Sierra de Veraguas. As a whole, the range between Costa Rica and the canal is generally referred to by geographers as the [[Cordillera Central, Costa Rica|Cordillera Central]].\n\nThe highest point in the country is the [[Volc\u00e1n Bar\u00fa]], which rises to {{convert|3,475|m|abbr=off}}. A nearly impenetrable jungle forms the [[Dari\u00e9n Gap]] between Panama and Colombia where Colombian [[guerrilla]]s and drug dealers operate and sometimes take [[hostage-taking|hostages]]. This and unrest, and forest protection movements, create a break in the [[Pan-American Highway]], which otherwise forms a complete road from [[Alaska]] to [[Patagonia]].\n\nPanama's wildlife is the most diverse in Central America. It is home to many South American species as well as to North American wildlife.\n\n[[File:chagres.jpg|thumb|The [[Chagres River]]]]\n\n===Waterways===\n{{main|Panama Canal}}\nNearly 500 rivers lace Panama's rugged landscape. Mostly unnavigable, many originate as swift highland streams, meander in valleys, and form coastal deltas. However, the [[R\u00edo Chagres]] (''Chagres River''), located in central Panama, is one of the few wide rivers and a source of [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] power. The central part of the river is dammed by the [[Gatun Dam]] and forms [[Gatun Lake]], an [[artificial lake]] that constitutes part of the [[Panama Canal]]. The lake was created by the construction of the Gatun Dam across the R\u00edo Chagres between 1907 and 1913. Once  created, Gatun Lake was the largest man-made lake in the world, and the dam was the largest earth dam. The river drains northwest into the Caribbean. The Kampia and Madden Lakes (also filled from the R\u00edo Chagres) provide hydroelectricity for the area of the former Canal Zone.\n\nThe R\u00edo Chepo, another source of hydroelectric power, is one of the more than 300 rivers emptying into the Pacific. These Pacific-oriented rivers are longer and slower-running than those on the Caribbean side. Their basins are also more extensive. One of the longest is the [[R\u00edo Tuira]], which flows into the [[Golfo de San Miguel]] and is the nation's only river that is navigable by larger vessels.\n\n===Harbors===\nThe Caribbean coastline is marked by several natural harbors. However, Crist\u00f3bal, at the Caribbean terminus of the canal, had the only important port facilities in the late 1980s. The numerous islands of the Archipi\u00e9lago de Bocas del Toro, near the Beaches of Costa Rica, provide an extensive natural roadstead and shield the banana port of [[Almirante, Bocas del Toro|Almirante]]. The more than 350 [[San Blas Islands]] near Colombia, are strung out over more than {{convert|160|km|abbr=off}} along the sheltered Caribbean coastline.\n\n[[File:Colon Panama.jpg|thumb|[[Col\u00f3n, Panama|Col\u00f3n Harbor]], 2000]]\nThe terminal ports located at each end of the Panama Canal, namely the [[Port of Crist\u00f3bal]], Col\u00f3n and the [[Port of Balboa]], are ranked second and third respectively in Latin America in terms of numbers of containers units ([[Twenty-foot equivalent unit|TEU]]) handled.<ref>{{cite web |author=CEPAL \u2013 Naciones Unidas |url=http://www.eclac.cl/cgi-bin/getprod.asp?xml=/Transporte/noticias/noticias/8/38828/P38828.xml&base=/tpl/top-bottom.xsl |title=Ranking 2009 de Actividad portuaria de contenedores en Am\u00e9rica Latina y el Caribe |publisher=Eclac.cl |date=March 22, 2010 |accessdate=December 23, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511140155/http://www.eclac.cl/cgi-bin/getprod.asp?xml=%2FTransporte%2Fnoticias%2Fnoticias%2F8%2F38828%2FP38828.xml&base=%2Ftpl%2Ftop-bottom.xsl |archivedate=May 11, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The Port of Balboa covers 182 hectares and contains four berths for containers and two multi-purpose berths.

Temperatures are uniformly high\u2014as is the relative humidity\u2014and there is little seasonal variation. [[Diurnal temperature variation|Diurnal ranges]] are low; on a typical dry-season day in the capital city, the early morning minimum may be {{convert|24|\u00b0C|1}} and the afternoon maximum {{convert|30|\u00b0C|1}}. The temperature seldom exceeds {{convert|32|\u00b0C|1}} for more than a short time. Temperatures on the Pacific side of the isthmus are somewhat lower than on the Caribbean, and breezes tend to rise after dusk in most parts of the country. Temperatures are markedly cooler in the higher parts of the mountain ranges, and frosts occur in the [[Cordillera de Talamanca]] in western Panama.\n\nClimatic regions are determined less on the basis of temperature than on [[rain]]fall, which varies regionally from less than {{convert|1300|mm|in|1|sp=us}} to more than {{convert|3000|mm|in|1|sp=us}} per year. Almost all of the rain falls during the rainy season, which is usually from April to December, but varies in length from seven to nine months. In general, rainfall is much heavier on the Caribbean than on the Pacific side of the [[continental divide]]. The annual average in Panama City is little more than half of that in Col\u00f3n. Although rainy-season thunderstorms are common, the country is outside the [[hurricane belt]].\n\nPanama's tropical environment supports an abundance of plants. Forests dominate, interrupted in places by grasslands, scrub, and crops. Although nearly 40% of Panama is still wooded, [[deforestation]] is a continuing threat to the rain-drenched woodlands. Tree cover has been reduced by more than 50 percent since the 1940s. Subsistence farming, widely practised from the northeastern jungles to the southwestern grasslands, consists largely of corn, bean, and tuber plots. [[Mangrove swamp]]s occur along parts of both coasts, with banana plantations occupying deltas near Costa Rica. In many places, a multi-canopied [[rain forest]] abuts the swamp on one side of the country and extends to the lower reaches of slopes on the other.\n\n==Politics==\n{{Main|Politics of Panama}}\n\n[[File:Asamblea Nacional de Panam\u00e1.JPG|thumb|The [[National Assembly of Panama]]]]\nPanama's politics take place in a framework of a [[presidential system|presidential]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] republic, whereby the [[President of Panama]] is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]], and of a [[multi-party system]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the government and the [[National Assembly of Panama|National Assembly]]. The [[judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature.\n\nNational elections are universal and mandatory for all citizens 18 years and older. National elections for the executive and legislative branches take place every five years. Members of the judicial branch (justices) are appointed by the head of state. Panama's [[National Assembly of Panama|National Assembly]] is elected by proportional representation in fixed electoral districts, so many smaller parties are represented. Presidential elections requires a simple majority; out of the five last presidents only ex-president Ricardo Martinelli has managed to be elected with over 50 percent of the popular vote.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8031425.stm Tycoon elected Panama's president] Retrieved July 25, 2010</ref>\n\n===Political culture===\nSince the end of [[Manuel Noriega]]'s military dictatorship in 1989, Panama has successfully completed five peaceful transfers of power to opposing political factions. The political landscape is dominated by two major parties and many smaller parties, many of which are driven by individual leaders more than ideologies. Former President [[Mart\u00edn Torrijos]] is the son of general [[Omar Torrijos]]. He succeeded [[Mireya Moscoso]], the widow of [[Arnulfo Arias]]. Panama's most recent [[Panamanian general election, 2014|national elections occurred on May 4, 2014]], with incumbent vice-President [[Juan Carlos Varela]] declared the victor. The [[2019 Panamanian general election]] is scheduled for May 5, 2019, with current President [[Juan Carlos Varela]] being ineligible due to constitutional limits for a second term. \n\n===Foreign relations===\n{{Further|Foreign relations of Panama}}\n[[File:John Kerry con Juan Carlos Varela e Isabel Saint Malo.jpg|thumb|left|Panama's President-elect [[Juan Carlos Varela]] and Vice President [[Isabel Saint Malo]] with then-US Secretary of State [[John Kerry]] just before Varela's inauguration in 2014]]\n\nThe United States cooperates with the Panamanian government in promoting economic, political, security, and social development through US and international agencies. Cultural ties between the two countries are strong, and many Panamanians go to the United States for higher education and advanced training.\n\n===Military===\n{{Further|Panamanian Public Forces}}\n\nThe [[Panamanian Public Forces]] are the national security forces of Panama. Panama is the second country in Latin America (the other being [[Costa Rica]]) to permanently abolish its standing army.

For example, the ''[[tamborito]]'' is a Spanish dance with African rhythms, themes and dance moves.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://panama-culture.com/ |title=The online almanac of Panama culture with travel links |publisher=Panama Culture |accessdate=December 23, 2010}}</ref>\n\nDance is typical of the diverse cultures in Panama. The local folklore can be experienced at a multitude of festivals, through dances and traditions handed down from generation to generation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vacationtopanama.com/travel-guide/cultural-melting-pot/|title=Panama Culture and Traditions, a True Melting Pot of Mesoamerica|website=Panama Vacations|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-22}}</ref> Local cities host live ''[[reggae en espa\u00f1ol]]'', ''[[reggaeton]]'', ''haitiano ([[compas]])'', [[jazz]], [[blues]], ''[[salsa music|salsa]]'', [[reggae]], and [[rock music]] performances.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n===Handicraft===\nOutside Panama City, regional festivals take place throughout the year featuring local musicians and dancers. Panama's blended culture is reflected in traditional products, such as [[woodcarving]]s, ceremonial masks and [[pottery]], as well as in Panama's architecture, cuisine and festivals. In earlier times, baskets were woven for utilitarian uses, but now many villages rely almost exclusively on income from the baskets they produce for tourists.\n\nAn example of undisturbed, unique culture in Panama is that of the [[Guna Yala|Guna]] who are known for ''[[mola (art form)|molas]]''. ''Mola'' is the Guna word for blouse, but the term ''mola'' has come to mean the elaborate embroidered panels made by Guna women, that make up the front and back of a Guna woman's blouse. They are several layers of cloth, varying in color, that are loosely stitched together, made using a reverse [[appliqu\u00e9]] process.\n\n===Holidays and festivities===\n{{Further|Public holidays in Panama}}\n\nThe Christmas parade, known as ''El desfile de Navidad'', is celebrated in the capital, Panama City. This holiday is celebrated on December 25. The floats in the parade are decorated in the Panamanian colors, and women wear dresses called ''[[pollera]]'' and men dress in traditional montuno. In addition, the marching band in the parade, consisting of drummers, keeps crowds entertained. In the city, a big Christmas tree is lit with Christmas lights, and everybody surrounds the tree and sings Christmas carols.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs|date=June 23, 2010|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2030.htm|title=Panama}}</ref>\n\n===Traditional cuisine===\n{{Further|Panamanian cuisine}}\nSince Panama's cultural heritage is influenced by many ethnicities the traditional cuisine of the country includes ingredients from many cultures, from all over the world:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.premiercasa.com/en/panama/panama-guide/a-guide-to-panama-food-culture|title=A Guide to Panama Food Culture|website=www.premiercasa.com}}</ref> \na mix of African, Spanish, and Native American techniques, dishes, and ingredients, reflecting its diverse population. Since Panama is a land bridge between two continents, it has a large variety of tropical fruits, vegetables and herbs that are used in native cooking.\nThe famous fish market known as the \"Mercado de Mariscos\" offers fresh seafood and [[Ceviche]], a seafood dish. Small shops along the street which are called kiosco and [[Empanada]], which is a typical latinamerican pastry, including a variety of different ingredients, either with meat or vegetarian, mostly fried. Another kind of pastry  is the [[pastelito]], with the only difference in comparison to [[empanada]]s is that they are bigger.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nTypical Panamanian foods are mild-flavored, without the pungency of some of Panama's Latin American and Caribbean neighbors. Common ingredients are [[maize]], [[rice]], [[wheat]] flour, [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]]s, ''yuca'' ([[cassava]]), beef, chicken, pork and seafood.\n\n===Traditional clothing===\n\nPanamanian men's traditional clothing, called ''montuno'', consists of white cotton shirts, trousers and woven straw hats.\n\nThe traditional women's clothing is the ''pollera''. It originated in Spain in the 16th century, and by the early 1800s it was typical in Panama, worn by female servants, especially wet nurses (''De Zarate'' 5). Later, it was adopted by upper-class women.\n\nA ''pollera'' is made of \"[[cambric]]\" or \"fine linen\" (Baker 177). It is white, and is usually about 13 yards of material.\n\nThe original ''pollera'' consists of a ruffled blouse worn off the shoulders and a skirt with gold buttons. The skirt is also ruffled, so that when it is lifted up, it looks like a peacock's tail or a ''[[mantilla]]'' fan. The designs on the skirt and blouse are usually flowers or birds. Two large matching [[pom pom]]s (''mota'') are on the front and back, four ribbons hang from the front and back from the waist, five gold chains (''caberstrillos'') hang from the neck to the waist, a gold cross or medallion on a black ribbon is worn as a [[choker]], and a silk purse is worn at the waistline. Earrings (''zaricillos'') are usually gold or coral. Slippers usually match the color of the ''pollera''. Hair is usually worn in a bun, held by three large gold combs that have pearls (''tembleques'') worn like a crown. Quality ''pollera'' can cost up to $10,000, and may take a year to complete.\n\nToday, there are different types of ''polleras''; the ''pollera de gala'' consists of a short-sleeved ruffle skirt blouse, two full-length skirts and a [[petticoat]]. Girls wear ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20170518133519/http://panamafolktembleques.com/ tembleques]'' in their hair. Gold coins and jewelry are added to the outfit. The ''pollera montuna'' is a daily dress, with a blouse, a skirt with a solid color, a single gold chain, and pendant earrings and a natural flower in the hair. Instead of an off-the-shoulder blouse it is worn with a fitted white jacket that has shoulder pleats and a flared hem.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110726000349/http://discoverytheater.org/education/guides/2010/Celebremos%20Panama!%20Resource%20Guide.pdf Celebremos Panama!]. Discovery Theater and Smithonian Latino Center</ref>\n\nTraditional clothing in Panama can be worn in parades, where the females and males do a traditional dance. Females gently sway and twirl their skirts, while men hold their hats in their hands and dance behind the females.\n\n===Literature===\n{{Further|Panamanian literature}}\nThe first literature relating to Panama can be dated to 1535, with a modern literary movement appearing from the mid-19th century onwards\n\n===Sports===\n[[File:Carlos Ruiz.jpg|thumb|upright|Panamanian baseball catcher [[Carlos Ruiz (baseball)|Carlos Ruiz]] during 2007 Spring Training]]\nThe US influence in Panama can be seen in the country's sports.

[[Flag football]] has also been growing in popularity in both men and women and with international participation in world of this discipline being among the best teams in the world, the sport was introduced by Americans residing in the Canal Zone for veterans and retirees who even had a festival called the Turkey Ball.

The exact location of the village is unknown. The legend is usually corroborated by Captain Antonio Tello de Guzm\u00e1n's diary entries, who reports landing at an unnamed village while exploring the Pacific coast of Panama in 1515; he only describes the village as a \"same small indigenous fishing town\". In 1517, Don [[Gaspar de Espinosa]], a Spanish lieutenant, decided to settle a post in the same location Guzm\u00e1n described.

Later central Panama was home to some of the first [[pottery]]-making in the Americas, for example the cultures at [[Monagrillo (archaeological site)|Monagrillo]], which date back to 2500\u20131700 BC. These evolved into significant populations best known through their spectacular burials (dating to c. 500\u2013900 AD) at the [[Monagrillo (archaeological site)|Monagrillo]] [[archaeological site]], and their beautiful [[Gran Cocl\u00e9]] style [[polychrome pottery]]. The monumental [[monolith]]ic sculptures at the [[Barriles]] (Chiriqui) site are also important traces of these ancient isthmian cultures.\n\nBefore Europeans arrived Panama was widely settled by [[Chibchan]], [[Chocoan]], and [[Cueva people|Cueva]] peoples. The largest group were the Cueva (whose specific language affiliation is poorly documented). The size of the [[Indigenous people of the Americas|indigenous]] population of the isthmus at the time of European colonization is uncertain. Estimates range as high as two million people, but more recent studies place that number closer to 200,000. Archaeological finds and testimonials by early European explorers describe diverse native isthmian groups exhibiting cultural variety and suggesting people developed{{clarify|date=August 2016|reason=Is this an anthropological term?}} by regular regional routes of commerce.\n\nWhen Panama was colonized, the indigenous peoples fled into the forest and nearby islands. Scholars believe that [[infectious disease]] was the primary cause of the population decline of American natives. The indigenous peoples had no [[acquired immunity]] to diseases which had been chronic in Eurasian populations for centuries.<ref>Hays, J. N. (2005).

A year later, [[Christopher Columbus]] visited the isthmus, and established a short-lived settlement in the [[Dari\u00e9n Province|Darien]]. [[Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa]]'s tortuous trek from the Atlantic to the Pacific in 1513 demonstrated that the isthmus was indeed the path between the seas, and Panama quickly became the crossroads and marketplace of Spain's empire in the [[New World]]. Gold and silver were brought by ship from South America, hauled across the isthmus, and loaded aboard ships for Spain. The route became known as the Camino Real, or Royal Road, although it was more commonly known as Camino de Cruces (Road of Crosses) because of the number of gravesites along the way.\n\nPanama was under [[Spanish Empire|Spanish rule]] for almost 300 years (1538\u20131821), and became part of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]], along with all other Spanish possessions in South America. From the outset, Panamanian identity was based on a sense of \"geographic destiny\", and Panamanian fortunes fluctuated with the geopolitical importance of the isthmus. The colonial experience spawned Panamanian nationalism and a racially complex and highly stratified society, the source of internal conflicts that ran counter to the unifying force of nationalism.<ref>{{Cite book|title=La inmigraci\u00f3n prohibida en Panam\u00e1 y sus prejuicios raciales|last=Arango Durling |trans-title=Prohibited immigration in Panam\u00e1 and its racial prejudices |first=Virginia |publisher=Publipan |year=1999 |lccn=2001388757 |location=Panam\u00e1  |language=Spanish |pages=}}</ref>{{page needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nIn 1538 the [[Real Audiencia of Panama]] was established, initially with [[jurisdiction]] from Nicaragua to [[Cape Horn]], until the conquest of Peru. A Real Audiencia was a judicial district that functioned as an appeals court. Each audiencia had an ''[[oidor]]'' (Spanish: hearer, a judge).\n\nSpanish authorities had little control over much of the territory of Panama. Large sections managed to resist conquest and missionization until very late in the colonial era. Because of this, indigenous people of the area were often referred to as \"indios de guerra\" (war Indians) who resisted Spanish attempts to conquer them or missionize them.  However, Panama was enormously important to Spain strategically because it was the easiest way to transship silver mined in Peru to Europe.  Silver cargoes were landed at Panama and then taken overland to [[Portobelo, Col\u00f3n|Portobello]] or [[Nombre de Dios, Col\u00f3n|Nombre de Dios]] on the Caribbean side of the isthmus for further shipment.\n\nBecause of incomplete Spanish control, the Panama route was vulnerable to attack from pirates (mostly Dutch and English), and from \"new world\" Africans called [[cimarron people (Panama)|cimarrons]] who had freed themselves from enslavement and lived in communes or ''palenques'' around the Camino Real in Panama's Interior, and on some of the islands off Panama's Pacific coast. One such famous community amounted to a small kingdom under [[Bayano]], which emerged in the 1552 to 1558. Sir [[Francis Drake]]'s famous raids on Panama in 1572\u201373 and [[John Oxenham]]'s crossing to the [[Pacific Ocean]] were aided by Panama cimarrons, and Spanish authorities were only able to bring them under control by making an alliance with them that guaranteed their freedom in exchange for military support in 1582.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Pike, Ruth |title=Black Rebels: Cimarrons in Sixteenth Century Panama|journal=The Americas|volume= 64|issue=2 |year=2007|pages= 243\u201366|doi=10.1353/tam.2007.0161}}</ref>\n\nThe prosperity enjoyed during the first two centuries (1540\u20131740) while contributing to colonial growth; the placing of extensive regional judicial authority (Real Audiencia) as part of its jurisdiction; and the pivotal role it played at the height of the Spanish Empire \u2013 the first modern global empire \u2013 helped define a distinctive sense of autonomy and of regional or national identity within Panama well before the rest of the colonies.\n\nThe end of the [[encomienda]] system in [[Azuero Peninsula|Azuero]], however, sparked the conquest of [[Veraguas]] in that same year. Under the leadership of Francisco V\u00e1zquez, the region of Veraguas passed into Castilian rule in 1558. In the newly conquered region, the old system of encomienda was imposed. On the other hand, the Panamanian movement for independence can be indirectly attributed to the abolition of the encomienda system in the [[Azuero Peninsula]], set forth by the Spanish Crown, in 1558 because of repeated protests by locals against the mistreatment of the native population. In its stead, a system of medium and smaller-sized landownership was promoted, thus taking away the power from the large landowners and into the hands of medium and small-sized proprietors.\n\nPanama was the site of the ill-fated [[Darien scheme]], which set up a [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scottish]] colony in the region in 1698. This failed for a number of reasons, and the ensuing debt contributed to the [[Acts of Union 1707|union]] of England and Scotland in 1707.<ref>\"[http://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/Scotland-History/DarienScheme.htm The Darien Scheme \u2013 The Fall of Scotland] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205194052/http://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/Scotland-History/DarienScheme.htm |date=February 5, 2012 }}\", Historic UK</ref>\n\nIn 1671, the [[privateer]] [[Henry Morgan]], licensed by the English government, sacked and burned the city of [[Panam\u00e1 Viejo|Panama]] \u2013 the second most important city in the Spanish New World at the time. In 1717 the [[viceroyalty of New Granada]] (northern South America) was created in response to other Europeans trying to take Spanish territory in the Caribbean region. The Isthmus of Panama was placed under its jurisdiction. However, the remoteness of New Granada's capital, [[Santa Fe de Bogot\u00e1]] (the modern capital of [[Colombia]]) proved a greater obstacle than the Spanish crown anticipated as the authority of New Granada was contested by the seniority, closer proximity, and previous ties to the viceroyalty of Lima and even by Panama's own initiative. This uneasy relationship between Panama and Bogot\u00e1 would persist for centuries.\n\nIn 1744, Bishop Francisco Javier de Luna Victoria DeCastro established the College of San Ignacio de Loyola and on June 3, 1749, founded La Real y Pontificia Universidad de San Javier. By this time, however, Panama's importance and influence had become insignificant as Spain's power dwindled in Europe and advances in navigation technique increasingly permitted ships to round Cape Horn in order to reach the Pacific. While the Panama route was short it was also labor-intensive and expensive because of the loading and unloading and laden-down trek required to get from the one coast to the other.\n\n====1800s====\n\n[[File:Arco chato.jpg|thumb|[[Santo Domingo Church]]]]\nAs the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] were heating up all across Latin America, Panama City was preparing for independence; however, their plans were accelerated by the unilateral Grito de La Villa de Los Santos (Cry From the Town of Saints), issued on November 10, 1821, by the residents of [[province|Azuero]] without backing from Panama City to declare their separation from the Spanish Empire. In both [[Veraguas]] and the capital this act was met with disdain, although on differing levels. To Veraguas, it was the ultimate act of treason, while to the capital, it was seen as inefficient and irregular, and furthermore forced them to accelerate their plans.\n\nNevertheless, the Grito was a sign, on the part of the residents of Azuero, of their antagonism toward the independence movement in the capital. Those in the capital region in turn regarded the Azueran movement with contempt, since the separatists in Panama City believed that their counterparts in Azuero were fighting not only for independence from Spain, but also for their right to self-rule apart from Panama City once the Spaniards were gone.\n\nIt was seen as a risky move on the part of Azuero, which lived in fear of Colonel [[History of Panama#Jos\u00e9 de F\u00e1brega|Jos\u00e9 Pedro Antonio de F\u00e1brega y de las Cuevas]] (1774\u20131841). The colonel was a staunch loyalist and had all of the isthmus' military supplies in his hands. They feared quick retaliation and swift retribution against the separatists.\n\nWhat they had counted on, however, was the influence of the separatists in the capital. Ever since October 1821, when the former Governor General, [[Juan de la Cruz Murge\u00f3n]], left the isthmus on a campaign in [[Quito]] and left a colonel in charge, the separatists had been slowly converting F\u00e1brega to the separatist side. So, by November 10, F\u00e1brega was now a supporter of the independence movement. Soon after the separatist declaration of Los Santos, F\u00e1brega convened every organization in the capital with separatist interests and formally declared the city's support for independence. No military repercussions occurred because of skillful bribing of royalist troops.\n\n===Post-colonial Panama===\n[[File:Panama canal cartooon 1903.jpg|thumb|1903 political cartoon.

Perez Balladares worked skillfully during the campaign to rehabilitate the PRD's image, emphasizing the party's populist Torrijos roots rather than its association with Noriega. He won the election with only 33 percent of the vote when the major non-PRD forces splintered into competing factions.

It mostly lies between latitudes [[7th parallel north|7\u00b0]] and [[10th parallel north|10\u00b0N]], and longitudes [[77th meridian west|77\u00b0]] and [[83rd meridian west|83\u00b0W]] (a small area lies west of 83\u00b0).\n\nIts location on the [[Isthmus of Panama]] is strategic. By 2000, Panama controlled the [[Panama Canal]] which connects the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea to the North of the Pacific Ocean.  Panama's total area is 74,177.3&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.<ref name=area>{{cite web |url=https://www.contraloria.gob.pa/inec/archivos/P6221DATOS%20GENERALES%20%20%20%202013.pdf |title=Datos generales e hist\u00f3ricos de la Rep\u00fablica de Panam\u00e1 |language=es |publisher=[[National Institute of Statistics and Census of Panama|INEC]] |accessdate=December 22, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe dominant feature of Panama's geography is the central spine of mountains and hills that forms the [[continental divide]]. The divide does not form part of the great mountain chains of North America, and only near the Colombian border are there highlands related to the [[Andes|Andean]] system of South America. The spine that forms the divide is the highly eroded arch of an uplift from the sea bottom, in which peaks were formed by volcanic intrusions.\n\nThe mountain range of the divide is called the [[Cordillera de Talamanca]] near the Costa Rican border. Farther east it becomes the Serran\u00eda de Tabasar\u00e1, and the portion of it closer to the lower saddle of the isthmus, where the Panama Canal is located, is often called the Sierra de Veraguas. As a whole, the range between Costa Rica and the canal is generally referred to by geographers as the [[Cordillera Central, Costa Rica|Cordillera Central]].\n\nThe highest point in the country is the [[Volc\u00e1n Bar\u00fa]], which rises to {{convert|3,475|m|abbr=off}}. A nearly impenetrable jungle forms the [[Dari\u00e9n Gap]] between Panama and Colombia where Colombian [[guerrilla]]s and drug dealers operate and sometimes take [[hostage-taking|hostages]]. This and unrest, and forest protection movements, create a break in the [[Pan-American Highway]], which otherwise forms a complete road from [[Alaska]] to [[Patagonia]].\n\nPanama's wildlife is the most diverse in Central America. It is home to many South American species as well as to North American wildlife.\n\n[[File:chagres.jpg|thumb|The [[Chagres River]]]]\n\n===Waterways===\n{{main|Panama Canal}}\nNearly 500 rivers lace Panama's rugged landscape. Mostly unnavigable, many originate as swift highland streams, meander in valleys, and form coastal deltas. However, the [[R\u00edo Chagres]] (''Chagres River''), located in central Panama, is one of the few wide rivers and a source of [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] power. The central part of the river is dammed by the [[Gatun Dam]] and forms [[Gatun Lake]], an [[artificial lake]] that constitutes part of the [[Panama Canal]]. The lake was created by the construction of the Gatun Dam across the R\u00edo Chagres between 1907 and 1913. Once  created, Gatun Lake was the largest man-made lake in the world, and the dam was the largest earth dam. The river drains northwest into the Caribbean. The Kampia and Madden Lakes (also filled from the R\u00edo Chagres) provide hydroelectricity for the area of the former Canal Zone.\n\nThe R\u00edo Chepo, another source of hydroelectric power, is one of the more than 300 rivers emptying into the Pacific. These Pacific-oriented rivers are longer and slower-running than those on the Caribbean side. Their basins are also more extensive. One of the longest is the [[R\u00edo Tuira]], which flows into the [[Golfo de San Miguel]] and is the nation's only river that is navigable by larger vessels.\n\n===Harbors===\nThe Caribbean coastline is marked by several natural harbors. However, Crist\u00f3bal, at the Caribbean terminus of the canal, had the only important port facilities in the late 1980s. The numerous islands of the Archipi\u00e9lago de Bocas del Toro, near the Beaches of Costa Rica, provide an extensive natural roadstead and shield the banana port of [[Almirante, Bocas del Toro|Almirante]]. The more than 350 [[San Blas Islands]] near Colombia, are strung out over more than {{convert|160|km|abbr=off}} along the sheltered Caribbean coastline.\n\n[[File:Colon Panama.jpg|thumb|[[Col\u00f3n, Panama|Col\u00f3n Harbor]], 2000]]\nThe terminal ports located at each end of the Panama Canal, namely the [[Port of Crist\u00f3bal]], Col\u00f3n and the [[Port of Balboa]], are ranked second and third respectively in Latin America in terms of numbers of containers units ([[Twenty-foot equivalent unit|TEU]]) handled.<ref>{{cite web |author=CEPAL \u2013 Naciones Unidas |url=http://www.eclac.cl/cgi-bin/getprod.asp?xml=/Transporte/noticias/noticias/8/38828/P38828.xml&base=/tpl/top-bottom.xsl |title=Ranking 2009 de Actividad portuaria de contenedores en Am\u00e9rica Latina y el Caribe |publisher=Eclac.cl |date=March 22, 2010 |accessdate=December 23, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511140155/http://www.eclac.cl/cgi-bin/getprod.asp?xml=%2FTransporte%2Fnoticias%2Fnoticias%2F8%2F38828%2FP38828.xml&base=%2Ftpl%2Ftop-bottom.xsl |archivedate=May 11, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The Port of Balboa covers 182 hectares and contains four berths for containers and two multi-purpose berths.

Temperatures are uniformly high\u2014as is the relative humidity\u2014and there is little seasonal variation. [[Diurnal temperature variation|Diurnal ranges]] are low; on a typical dry-season day in the capital city, the early morning minimum may be {{convert|24|\u00b0C|1}} and the afternoon maximum {{convert|30|\u00b0C|1}}. The temperature seldom exceeds {{convert|32|\u00b0C|1}} for more than a short time. Temperatures on the Pacific side of the isthmus are somewhat lower than on the Caribbean, and breezes tend to rise after dusk in most parts of the country. Temperatures are markedly cooler in the higher parts of the mountain ranges, and frosts occur in the [[Cordillera de Talamanca]] in western Panama.\n\nClimatic regions are determined less on the basis of temperature than on [[rain]]fall, which varies regionally from less than {{convert|1300|mm|in|1|sp=us}} to more than {{convert|3000|mm|in|1|sp=us}} per year. Almost all of the rain falls during the rainy season, which is usually from April to December, but varies in length from seven to nine months. In general, rainfall is much heavier on the Caribbean than on the Pacific side of the [[continental divide]]. The annual average in Panama City is little more than half of that in Col\u00f3n. Although rainy-season thunderstorms are common, the country is outside the [[hurricane belt]].\n\nPanama's tropical environment supports an abundance of plants. Forests dominate, interrupted in places by grasslands, scrub, and crops. Although nearly 40% of Panama is still wooded, [[deforestation]] is a continuing threat to the rain-drenched woodlands. Tree cover has been reduced by more than 50 percent since the 1940s. Subsistence farming, widely practised from the northeastern jungles to the southwestern grasslands, consists largely of corn, bean, and tuber plots. [[Mangrove swamp]]s occur along parts of both coasts, with banana plantations occupying deltas near Costa Rica. In many places, a multi-canopied [[rain forest]] abuts the swamp on one side of the country and extends to the lower reaches of slopes on the other.\n\n==Politics==\n{{Main|Politics of Panama}}\n\n[[File:Asamblea Nacional de Panam\u00e1.JPG|thumb|The [[National Assembly of Panama]]]]\nPanama's politics take place in a framework of a [[presidential system|presidential]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] republic, whereby the [[President of Panama]] is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]], and of a [[multi-party system]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the government and the [[National Assembly of Panama|National Assembly]]. The [[judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature.\n\nNational elections are universal and mandatory for all citizens 18 years and older. National elections for the executive and legislative branches take place every five years. Members of the judicial branch (justices) are appointed by the head of state. Panama's [[National Assembly of Panama|National Assembly]] is elected by proportional representation in fixed electoral districts, so many smaller parties are represented. Presidential elections requires a simple majority; out of the five last presidents only ex-president Ricardo Martinelli has managed to be elected with over 50 percent of the popular vote.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8031425.stm Tycoon elected Panama's president] Retrieved July 25, 2010</ref>\n\n===Political culture===\nSince the end of [[Manuel Noriega]]'s military dictatorship in 1989, Panama has successfully completed five peaceful transfers of power to opposing political factions. The political landscape is dominated by two major parties and many smaller parties, many of which are driven by individual leaders more than ideologies. Former President [[Mart\u00edn Torrijos]] is the son of general [[Omar Torrijos]]. He succeeded [[Mireya Moscoso]], the widow of [[Arnulfo Arias]]. Panama's most recent [[Panamanian general election, 2014|national elections occurred on May 4, 2014]], with incumbent vice-President [[Juan Carlos Varela]] declared the victor. The [[2019 Panamanian general election]] is scheduled for May 5, 2019, with current President [[Juan Carlos Varela]] being ineligible due to constitutional limits for a second term. \n\n===Foreign relations===\n{{Further|Foreign relations of Panama}}\n[[File:John Kerry con Juan Carlos Varela e Isabel Saint Malo.jpg|thumb|left|Panama's President-elect [[Juan Carlos Varela]] and Vice President [[Isabel Saint Malo]] with then-US Secretary of State [[John Kerry]] just before Varela's inauguration in 2014]]\n\nThe United States cooperates with the Panamanian government in promoting economic, political, security, and social development through US and international agencies. Cultural ties between the two countries are strong, and many Panamanians go to the United States for higher education and advanced training.\n\n===Military===\n{{Further|Panamanian Public Forces}}\n\nThe [[Panamanian Public Forces]] are the national security forces of Panama. Panama is the second country in Latin America (the other being [[Costa Rica]]) to permanently abolish its standing army.

The official estimated cost of the project is US$5.25 billion, but the canal is of major economic importance because it provides millions of dollars of toll [[revenue]] to the national economy and provides massive employment. Transfer of control of the Canal to the Panamanian government completed in 1999, after 85 years of US control.\n\nCopper and gold deposits are being developed by foreign investors, to the dismay of some environmental groups, as all of the projects are located within protected areas.<ref>Oancea, Dan (January 2009).

Public education began as a national and governmental institution in 1903. The principle underlying the early education system was that children should receive different types of education in accordance with their social class and therefore the position they were expected to occupy in society.\n\n[[Public education]] began in Panama soon after it seceded from Colombia in 1903. The first efforts were guided by an extremely paternalistic view of the goals of education, as evidenced in comments made in a 1913 meeting of the First Panamanian Educational Assembly, \"The cultural heritage given to the child should be determined by the social position he will or should occupy. For this reason education should be different in accordance with the social class to which the student should be related.\" This elitist focus changed rapidly under US influence.<ref name=\"cs\">{{Country study|country=Panama|abbr=pa|editor=Sandra W.

In earlier times, baskets were woven for utilitarian uses, but now many villages rely almost exclusively on income from the baskets they produce for tourists.\n\nAn example of undisturbed, unique culture in Panama is that of the [[Guna Yala|Guna]] who are known for ''[[mola (art form)|molas]]''. ''Mola'' is the Guna word for blouse, but the term ''mola'' has come to mean the elaborate embroidered panels made by Guna women, that make up the front and back of a Guna woman's blouse.

In addition, the marching band in the parade, consisting of drummers, keeps crowds entertained. In the city, a big Christmas tree is lit with Christmas lights, and everybody surrounds the tree and sings Christmas carols.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs|date=June 23, 2010|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2030.htm|title=Panama}}</ref>\n\n===Traditional cuisine===\n{{Further|Panamanian cuisine}}\nSince Panama's cultural heritage is influenced by many ethnicities the traditional cuisine of the country includes ingredients from many cultures, from all over the world:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.premiercasa.com/en/panama/panama-guide/a-guide-to-panama-food-culture|title=A Guide to Panama Food Culture|website=www.premiercasa.com}}</ref> \na mix of African, Spanish, and Native American techniques, dishes, and ingredients, reflecting its diverse population. Since Panama is a land bridge between two continents, it has a large variety of tropical fruits, vegetables and herbs that are used in native cooking.\nThe famous fish market known as the \"Mercado de Mariscos\" offers fresh seafood and [[Ceviche]], a seafood dish. Small shops along the street which are called kiosco and [[Empanada]], which is a typical latinamerican pastry, including a variety of different ingredients, either with meat or vegetarian, mostly fried. Another kind of pastry  is the [[pastelito]], with the only difference in comparison to [[empanada]]s is that they are bigger.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nTypical Panamanian foods are mild-flavored, without the pungency of some of Panama's Latin American and Caribbean neighbors. Common ingredients are [[maize]], [[rice]], [[wheat]] flour, [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]]s, ''yuca'' ([[cassava]]), beef, chicken, pork and seafood.\n\n===Traditional clothing===\n\nPanamanian men's traditional clothing, called ''montuno'', consists of white cotton shirts, trousers and woven straw hats.\n\nThe traditional women's clothing is the ''pollera''. It originated in Spain in the 16th century, and by the early 1800s it was typical in Panama, worn by female servants, especially wet nurses (''De Zarate'' 5). Later, it was adopted by upper-class women.\n\nA ''pollera'' is made of \"[[cambric]]\" or \"fine linen\" (Baker 177). It is white, and is usually about 13 yards of material.\n\nThe original ''pollera'' consists of a ruffled blouse worn off the shoulders and a skirt with gold buttons. The skirt is also ruffled, so that when it is lifted up, it looks like a peacock's tail or a ''[[mantilla]]'' fan. The designs on the skirt and blouse are usually flowers or birds. Two large matching [[pom pom]]s (''mota'') are on the front and back, four ribbons hang from the front and back from the waist, five gold chains (''caberstrillos'') hang from the neck to the waist, a gold cross or medallion on a black ribbon is worn as a [[choker]], and a silk purse is worn at the waistline. Earrings (''zaricillos'') are usually gold or coral. Slippers usually match the color of the ''pollera''. Hair is usually worn in a bun, held by three large gold combs that have pearls (''tembleques'') worn like a crown. Quality ''pollera'' can cost up to $10,000, and may take a year to complete.\n\nToday, there are different types of ''polleras''; the ''pollera de gala'' consists of a short-sleeved ruffle skirt blouse, two full-length skirts and a [[petticoat]]. Girls wear ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20170518133519/http://panamafolktembleques.com/ tembleques]'' in their hair. Gold coins and jewelry are added to the outfit. The ''pollera montuna'' is a daily dress, with a blouse, a skirt with a solid color, a single gold chain, and pendant earrings and a natural flower in the hair. Instead of an off-the-shoulder blouse it is worn with a fitted white jacket that has shoulder pleats and a flared hem.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110726000349/http://discoverytheater.org/education/guides/2010/Celebremos%20Panama!%20Resource%20Guide.pdf Celebremos Panama!].

Females gently sway and twirl their skirts, while men hold their hats in their hands and dance behind the females.\n\n===Literature===\n{{Further|Panamanian literature}}\nThe first literature relating to Panama can be dated to 1535, with a modern literary movement appearing from the mid-19th century onwards\n\n===Sports===\n[[File:Carlos Ruiz.jpg|thumb|upright|Panamanian baseball catcher [[Carlos Ruiz (baseball)|Carlos Ruiz]] during 2007 Spring Training]]\nThe US influence in Panama can be seen in the country's sports.

[[Flag football]] has also been growing in popularity in both men and women and with international participation in world of this discipline being among the best teams in the world, the sport was introduced by Americans residing in the Canal Zone for veterans and retirees who even had a festival called the Turkey Ball.

This led to lecturing, teaching, writing, and the publication of Beard's first cookbook in 1940: ''Hors D'Oeuvre and Canap\u00e9s'', a compilation of his catering recipes.

The family vacationed on the Pacific coast in [[Gearhart, Oregon]], where Beard was exposed to [[Pacific Northwest cuisine]].\n \nCommon ingredients of this cuisine are [[salmon]], [[shellfish]], and other fresh [[seafood]]; [[Game (food)|game]] meats such as [[moose]], [[elk]], or [[venison]]; [[mushroom]]s, [[Berry|berries]], small [[fruit]]s, [[potato]]es, [[kale]], and wild plants such as [[fiddleheads]] or young pushki (''[[Heracleum maximum]]'', or cow parsnip).\n\nBeard's earliest memory of food was at the 1905 [[Lewis and Clark Exposition]], when he was two years old. In his [[memoir]] he recalled:\n\n<blockquote>\nI was taken to the exposition two or three times. The thing that remained in my mind above all others\u2014I think it marked my life\u2014was watching [[Triscuit]]s and shredded wheat biscuits being made. Isn't that crazy? At two years old that memory was made. It intrigued the hell out of me.<ref>Beard, ''A James Beard Memoir'', pg. 25</ref></blockquote>\n\nAt age three Beard was bedridden with [[malaria]], and the illness gave him time to focus on the food prepared by his mother and their [[Chinese people|Chinese]] helper.<ref>Kamp, pg. 19</ref> According to Beard he was raised by Thema and Jue-Let, who instilled in him a passion for [[Chinese culture]].<ref>Beard, ''A James Beard Memoir'', pg. 20</ref> Beard reportedly \"attributes much of his upbringing to Jue-Let,\" whom he refers to as his Chinese godfather.<ref name=\"Saveur\">[http://www.saveur.com/james-beard-chinese-jue-let/ Dao, Dan Q. \"Who was Jue-Let, the Unknown Chinese Chef Who Raised James Beard?

Unlucky in the theater, he and friend Bill Rhodes capitalized on the [[cocktail party]] craze by opening Hors d'Oeuvre, Inc., a [[catering]] company. This led to lecturing, teaching, writing, and the publication of Beard's first cookbook in 1940: ''Hors D'Oeuvre and Canap\u00e9s'', a compilation of his catering recipes. According to fellow cooking enthusiast [[Julia Child]], this book put him on the culinary map.<ref name=\"childsvi\">Beard, ''James Beard Beard on Food'', pg. vi</ref> [[World War II]] rationing ended Beard's catering business. From August 1946 to May 1947, he hosted ''[[I Love to Eat]]'', a live television cooking show on NBC, beginning his ascent as an American food authority. According to Child, \"Through the years he gradually became not only the leading culinary figure in the country, but 'The Dean of American Cuisine'.\"<ref name=\"childsvi\"/>\n\nIn 1952, when [[Helen Evans Brown]] published her ''Helen Brown's West Coast Cook Book'', Beard wrote her a letter igniting a friendship that spanned until Brown's death. The two, along with her husband Phillip, developed a friendship which was both professional and personal.

He continued to teach cooking to men and women for the next thirty years, both at his own schools (in New York City and Seaside, Oregon), and around the country at women's clubs, other cooking schools, and civic groups.

James Beard Foundation. Retrieved on July 19, 2010.</ref>\nBeard brought French cooking to the American middle and upper classes during the 1950s, appearing on TV as a cooking personality. David Kamp (who discusses Beard at length in his book, ''The United States of Arugula'') noted that Beard's was the first cooking show on TV.<ref>Kamp, pg. 55</ref> He compares [[Dione Lucas]]' cooking show and school with Beard's, noting that their prominence during the 1950s marked the emergence of a sophisticated, New York-based, nationally  and internationally known food culture.<ref>Kamp, pg. 57</ref> Kamp wrote, \"It was in this decade [the 1950s] that Beard made his name as ''James Beard'', the brand name, the face and belly of American gastronomy.\"<ref>Kamp, pg. 58</ref> He noted that Beard met [[Alice B. Toklas]] on a trip to Paris,<ref>Kamp, pg. 60</ref> indicative of the network of fellow food celebrities who would follow him during his life and carry on his legacy after his death.\n\nBeard made endorsement deals to promote products that he might not have otherwise used or suggested in his own cuisine, including [[Omaha Steaks]], [[French's]] Mustard, [[Green Giant]] Corn Niblets, [[Old Crow]] bourbon, [[Planters|Planters Peanuts]], [[Shasta (soft drink)|Shasta]] soft drinks, [[DuPont]] chemicals, and [[Lawry's and Adolph's|Adolph's Meat Tenderizer]]. According to Kamp, Beard later felt himself a \"gastronomic whore\" for doing so. Although he felt that mass-produced food that was neither fresh, local nor seasonal was a betrayal of his gastronomic beliefs, he needed the money for his cooking schools.<ref>Kamp, pg. 62</ref> According to Thomas McNamee, \"Beard, a man of stupendous appetites\u2014for food, sex, money, you name it\u2014stunned his subtler colleagues.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=McNamee|first=Thomas|title=The Man Who Changed the Way We Eat|url=https://archive.org/details/manwhochangedway0000mcna|url-access=registration|year=2012|publisher=Free Press, Div of Simon & Schuster|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1-4391-9150-7|pages=[https://archive.org/details/manwhochangedway0000mcna/page/339 339]}}</ref> In 1981 Beard and friend [[Gael Greene]] founded [[Citymeals-on-Wheels]], which continues to help feed the homebound elderly in New York City.\n\n==Personal life==\n[[Julia Child]] summed up Beard's personal life:\n<blockquote>Beard was the quintessential American cook. Well-educated and well-traveled during his eighty-two years, he was familiar with many cuisines but he remained fundamentally American.

[[Peter Kump]], a former student of Beard's and the founder of the [[Institute of Culinary Education]] (formerly Peter Kump's New York Cooking School), spearheaded efforts to purchase the house and create the [[James Beard Foundation]].\nBeard's renovated [[brownstone]] at 167 West 12th Street in [[Greenwich Village]], is [[North America]]'s only historic culinary center.

Under his supervision as secretary of the [[All England Club]] from 1907 to 1925, the [[Wimbledon Championships]] moved to its current site at Church Road. Hillyard also excelled at cricket and golf.\n\n== Biography ==\n\n=== Early years ===\nGeorge Whiteside Hillyard was born in [[Hanwell]], Middlesex on 6 February 1864, the only child of George Wright Hillyard (1817\u20131896) and his second wife Mary Mansfield (1827\u2013?). His father had been a police officer at [[Welwyn]], [[Hertfordshire]] by 1840 and later worked in the [[Nottingham]] County Jail before becoming superintendent at the [[Central London District School]] in West London in 1861. After his first wife Lucy had died in early 1862, he married Mary Mansfield in December the same year.<ref name=\"bt12\">{{cite book |last=Tarran |first=Bruce |date=2013 |title=George Hillyard: The Man Who Moved Wimbledon |location=Kibworth Beauchamp |publisher=Matador |isbn=978-1780885490 | pages=1\u20132 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1877, George senior sent his 13-year-old son to the [[Royal Navy]]. At first, he came to the [[Britannia Royal Naval College]] as a [[Naval cadet|cadet]]. In 1879, he was promoted to [[midshipman]] and was assigned to {{HMS|Bacchante|1876|6}} which toured the colonies of the [[British Empire]] around the world from 1880 to 1882. Among his fellow midshipmen were [[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale|Prince Albert]] and Prince George (later King [[George V]]).<ref name=\"bt56\">{{cite book |last=Tarran |first=Bruce |date=2013 |title=George Hillyard: The Man Who Moved Wimbledon |location=Kibworth Beauchamp |publisher=Matador |isbn=978-1780885490 | pages=5\u20136 }}</ref>\n\nHillyard resigned from the Navy with the rank of [[sub-lieutenant]] on 2 October 1885. His last posting was aboard {{HMS|Minotaur|1863|6}}.<ref name=\"bt8\">{{cite book |last=Tarran |first=Bruce |date=2013 |title=George Hillyard: The Man Who Moved Wimbledon |location=Kibworth Beauchamp |publisher=Matador |isbn=978-1780885490 | pages=8 }}</ref>\n\n=== Marriage and tennis career ===\nHillyard had been already introduced to tennis at the age of ten by his uncle, who had set up a [[Sphairistike]] court in 1875. However, he didn't like what he called \"pat-ball\" at first, and preferred cricket. After his Navy service, however, the rules of the game had undergone significant changes and Hillyard became attracted to it.<ref name=\"bt17\">{{cite book |last=Tarran |first=Bruce |date=2013 |title=George Hillyard: The Man Who Moved Wimbledon |location=Kibworth Beauchamp |publisher=Matador |isbn=978-1780885490 | page=17 }}</ref> From 1887, he began to play tournaments.<ref name=\"bt55\">{{cite book |last=Tarran |first=Bruce |date=2013 |title=George Hillyard: The Man Who Moved Wimbledon |location=Kibworth Beauchamp |publisher=Matador |isbn=978-1780885490 | page=55 }}</ref>\n\nHillyard married [[Blanche Bingley]] (1863\u20131946) in [[Greenford]] on 13 July 1887, one week after the Wimbledon final.<ref name=\"bt11\">{{cite book |last=Tarran |first=Bruce |date=2013 |title=George Hillyard: The Man Who Moved Wimbledon |location=Kibworth Beauchamp |publisher=Matador |isbn=978-1780885490 | pages=11 }}</ref> Blanche was the daughter of a wealthy tailoring business proprietor from London, and a successful tennis player. She had won the Wimbledon Championships in the previous year, and would win another five singles titles at Wimbledon alone until 1900. Blanche brought a considerable fortune into the marriage. Only five days after the wedding, the newly married couple competed at the Middlesex Championships at [[Chiswick Park]], and won the mixed doubles title.<ref name=\"bt11\" />\n\nIn 1889, Hillyard played the Wimbledon singles for the first time. He lost his quarter-final match against [[Harry S. Barlow|Harry Barlow]] in straight sets. He reached the doubles final twice at Wimbledon with [[Ernest Lewis (tennis)|Ernest Lewis]] in 1889 and 1890, but lost to the Renshaw brothers and [[Joshua Pim]] and [[Frank Stoker]], respectively. Alongside [[Harry Scrivener]], he won the doubles title at the [[British Covered Court Championships]] in 1890 and 1891. The following years, his focus shifted again to cricket, playing for Leicestershire, until 1896 when he won the singles, doubles, singles handicap and mixed doubles (with his wife) at [[Monte-Carlo Masters|Monte Carlo]].<ref name=\"bt6364\">{{cite book |last=Tarran |first=Bruce |date=2013 |title=George Hillyard: The Man Who Moved Wimbledon |location=Kibworth Beauchamp |publisher=Matador |isbn=978-1780885490 | pages=63\u201364 }}</ref> In 1897, he won the first staging of the [[German Open Tennis Championships|International German Championships]] at [[Hamburg]], beating [[George Ball-Greene]] in five sets in the final. He repeated his success at Hamburg in 1900. At Wimbledon singles, early losses enabled him to win the [[All England Plate]] in 1898, and reach the final in 1899. At the 1901 Wimbledon singles, he beat [[Laurence Doherty]] in the third round before losing in the quarter-finals to [[Arthur Gore (tennis)|Arthur Gore]].<ref name=\"bt82\">{{cite book |last=Tarran |first=Bruce |date=2013 |title=George Hillyard: The Man Who Moved Wimbledon |location=Kibworth Beauchamp |publisher=Matador |isbn=978-1780885490 | page=82}}</ref>\n\nIn 1905, at 41 years of age, Hillyard lost the final at the [[Bad Homburg]] tournament against [[Anthony Wilding]]. He entered the Wimbledon Championships 1906, conceding a walkover to Arthur Gore. Being assigned secretary of the [[All England Club]] in 1907, he never entered the Championships again. However, he did continue to play minor tournaments such as at [[Eastbourne]], [[Yorkshire]] and Leicester until 1914. After the [[World War I|Great War]], at 55 years of age, he competed at his home tournament at Leicester and even won the mixed doubles alongside [[Gwendoline Eastlake-Smith|Gladys Lamplough]].<ref name=\"bt40\">{{cite book |last=Tarran |first=Bruce |date=2013 |title=George Hillyard: The Man Who Moved Wimbledon |location=Kibworth Beauchamp |publisher=Matador |isbn=978-1780885490 | pages=40 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1908, he competed at the [[1908 Summer Olympics|London Olympic Games]] and won the gold medal in doubles alongside [[Reginald Doherty]]. However, although being great fan of the Olympics in general, he was less enthusiastic about the idea of tennis being a part of it. In his book ''Forty Years of First Class Lawn Tennis'', published in 1924, he wrote: \"As for lawn tennis in conjunction with the Olympic Games, the whole thing is a inconguous farce. You could as well have Olympic cricket or Olympic golf. It is difficult to believe that players or public can treat the matter seriously or care two straws about it. Why it is wanted, or tolerated, when we already have the Davis Cup, is beyond my comprehension.\"<ref name=\"bt115\">{{cite book |last=Tarran |first=Bruce |date=2013 |title=George Hillyard: The Man Who Moved Wimbledon |location=Kibworth Beauchamp |publisher=Matador |isbn=978-1780885490 | pages=115}}</ref>\n\nHillyard was ranked World No. 5 for 1901 by Karoly Mazak.<ref name=\"Mazak\"/>\n\n=== Cricket ===\n[[File:LordHawkesTeaminAmerica1891.jpg|thumb|Lord Hawke's cricket team to North America in 1891/92. Hillyard is in the back row, 2nd from left.]]\nDuring his time at the Navy, Hillyard played a lot of different sports, but concentrated on cricket, and even was captain of the cricket team for two years. Afterwards, he made his first appearance for [[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex]] against the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] in 1886. Although initially quite successful, he soon thereafter realized he had great difficulties to compete on a first-class level. Consequently, from 1887 to 1890 he virtually retired, blaming his time at the Navy which allegedly had prevented him from practising more. However, in 1891, he took cricket up again and played some first-class matches for the MCC as well as the [[Gentlemen v Players|Gentlemen Players]]. Later that year, he participated in a [[Lord Hawke's XI cricket team in North America in 1891\u201392|trip of English cricketers to North America]] led by [[Martin Hawke, 7th Baron Hawke|Lord Hawke]] in winter 1891/92. There, Hillyard played both first-class matches at [[Philadelphia]]. In 1894, Lord Hawke arranged another trip to [[Lord Hawke's XI cricket team in North America in 1894|North America]], and Hillyard was again member of the party. At Philadelphia, he played in front of an audience of 10,000.<ref name=\"bt131133\">{{cite book |last=Tarran |first=Bruce |date=2013 |title=George Hillyard: The Man Who Moved Wimbledon |location=Kibworth Beauchamp |publisher=Matador |isbn=978-1780885490 | pages=131\u2013133 }}</ref>\n\nUpon his return, Hillyard occasionally played cricket for another two years, making a total of 49 first-class matches in his career. After 1896, he fully committed himself to tennis.<ref name=\"bt135\">{{cite book |last=Tarran |first=Bruce |date=2013 |title=George Hillyard: The Man Who Moved Wimbledon |location=Kibworth Beauchamp |publisher=Matador |isbn=978-1780885490 | pages=135 }}</ref>\n\n=== Thorpe Satchville ===\nHillyard and his wife lived at [[Leicestershire]] from at least 1893. In 1896, they moved into a large house with extensive grounds at [[Thorpe Satchville]], a small village near [[Leicester]]. The mansion provided nine bedrooms as well as two tennis courts and a nine-hole golf course.<ref name=\"bt3839\">{{cite book |last=Tarran |first=Bruce |date=2013 |title=George Hillyard: The Man Who Moved Wimbledon |location=Kibworth Beauchamp |publisher=Matador |isbn=978-1780885490 | pages=38\u201339 }}</ref> The Hillyards frequently hosted popular house parties with tennis champions such as [[Norman Brookes]], [[Harold Mahony]], [[Anthony Wilding]], [[May Sutton]], [[Violet Pinckney]] and [[Dora Boothby]] as guests. Until 1914, almost every strong foreign player who played at Wimbledon stayed at the home of the Hillyards.<ref name=\"bt82\"/>\n\n=== Secretary of the AEC, En-tout-cas ===\nHillyard, a long-time member of the [[All England Club]] along with his wife, was its secretary from 1907 to early 1925. One of his major concerns was the upkeep of the courts, and he insisted on high standards of court maintenance. In 1910, the club purchased a motor roller for the courts in order to replace the horse roller.<ref name=\"bt97\">{{cite book |last=Tarran |first=Bruce |date=2013 |title=George Hillyard: The Man Who Moved Wimbledon |location=Kibworth Beauchamp |publisher=Matador |isbn=978-1780885490 | pages=97 }}</ref>\n\nWith the success of the Wimbledon tournament, the necessity to move the ground from his initial location at Worple Road to a larger site became obvious. This had been discussed as early as Hillyard became secretary in 1907, but searching for a better suitable site took time, and the outbreak of World War I further postponed the issue. From 1914 to 1918, Hillyard rejoined the Navy, leaving it with the rank of [[commander]].<ref name=\"bt122\">{{cite book |last=Tarran |first=Bruce |date=2013 |title=George Hillyard: The Man Who Moved Wimbledon |location=Kibworth Beauchamp |publisher=Matador |isbn=978-1780885490 | pages=122}}</ref> After the war, the decision to build a new ground was confirmed in 1919. The new site was opened at the [[1922 Wimbledon Championships]]. After the [[1919 Wimbledon Championships]], the decision to build a new ground was confirmed. As the secretary, Hillyard was probably heavily involved in the search for, and selection of the new site at Church Road, and worked together with architect [[Stanley Peach]].<ref name=\"bt99\">{{cite book |last=Tarran |first=Bruce |date=2013 |title=George Hillyard: The Man Who Moved Wimbledon |location=Kibworth Beauchamp |publisher=Matador |isbn=978-1780885490 | pages=99 }}</ref> The new site was opened at the [[1922 Wimbledon Championships]].\n[[File:G w hillyard, eastbourne.jpg|thumb|George Hillyard at Eastbourne]]\nBeside his secretary post, Hillyard also was an umpire at Wimbledon. From 1919 to 1932, he umpired every ladies final.<ref name=\"bt128\">{{cite book |last=Tarran |first=Bruce |date=2013 |title=George Hillyard: The Man Who Moved Wimbledon |location=Kibworth Beauchamp |publisher=Matador |isbn=978-1780885490 | pages=128 }}</ref>\n\nBeing passionate about building perfect grass courts, Hillyard kept thinking about how to construct an equally good all-weather court. In 1909, he met Claude Brown, a manager of a nearly bankrupt brickyard at [[Syston]] near Leicester. Hillyard had been on a tennis tour in South Africa the winter before where he had played on courts made of crushed up ant heaps. He told this story to Brown, and both developed the idea of using crushed bricks for court surface. The first court was laid out at Hillyard's home at Thorpe Satchville, and was called ''En-tout-cas'' (literally \"in all cases\") upon the idea of a guest, a French lady. Brown renamed his company after it.<ref name=\"bt120121\">{{cite book |last=Tarran |first=Bruce |date=2013 |title=George Hillyard: The Man Who Moved Wimbledon |location=Kibworth Beauchamp |publisher=Matador |isbn=978-1780885490 | pages=120\u2013121 }}</ref> By 1914, business boomed across England. An agent was hired for the United States market, and the company turned into a multimillion-pound business. When the Championships moved to its new site at Church Road in 1922, nine en-tout-cas courts were laid beside the grass courts. For many years, the British Junior Championships were played on en-tous-cas.<ref name=\"bt123124\">{{cite book |last=Tarran |first=Bruce |date=2013 |title=George Hillyard: The Man Who Moved Wimbledon |location=Kibworth Beauchamp |publisher=Matador |isbn=978-1780885490 | pages=123\u2013124 }}</ref>\n\nHillyard's relationship to the En-tout-cas company throughout the years is somewhat diffuse. Clearly, he was in the perfect position to promote the court surface, and he was certainly involved in the decision to construct en-tout-cas courts at the new Wimbledon grounds, giving them a marketing coup. In 1929, when being involved in the construction of a golf course \u2013 a job which was given to En-tout-cas on Hillyard's recommendation \u2013, he eventually disclosed that he was a director of En-tout-cas, thus obviously receiving income from the company.<ref name=\"bt155\">{{cite book |last=Tarran |first=Bruce |date=2013 |title=George Hillyard: The Man Who Moved Wimbledon |location=Kibworth Beauchamp |publisher=Matador |isbn=978-1780885490 | pages=155 }}</ref>\n\n=== Final years ===\nIn 1925, at an age of 61, Hillyard resigned from his position as secretary of the All England Club. In the same year, he sold his house at Thorpe Satchville, and the Hillyards moved to [[Bramfold]], [[Pulborough]], [[Sussex]]. Their new house was of similar size, and Hillyard again constructed two tennis courts,<ref name=\"bt148\">{{cite book |last=Tarran |first=Bruce |date=2013 |title=George Hillyard: The Man Who Moved Wimbledon |location=Kibworth Beauchamp |publisher=Matador |isbn=978-1780885490 | pages=148\u2013149 }}</ref> but began to focus on playing golf. Upon his initiative, a new golf course was completed at the West Sussex Golf Club, and opened on 8 August 1930.<ref name=\"bt155\"/>\n\nHillyard died at his home on 25 March 1943, aged 79. His wife Blanche was to survive him for three years. The couple had two children, [[Jack Hillyard|Jack]] (1890\u20131983) and Marjorie (1895\u2013?).

Under his supervision as secretary of the [[All England Club]] from 1907 to 1925, the [[Wimbledon Championships]] moved to its current site at Church Road. Hillyard also excelled at cricket and golf.\n\n== Biography ==\n\n=== Early years ===\nGeorge Whiteside Hillyard was born in [[Hanwell]], Middlesex on 6 February 1864, the only child of George Wright Hillyard (1817\u20131896) and his second wife Mary Mansfield (1827\u2013?). His father had been a police officer at [[Welwyn]], [[Hertfordshire]] by 1840 and later worked in the [[Nottingham]] County Jail before becoming superintendent at the [[Central London District School]] in West London in 1861. After his first wife Lucy had died in early 1862, he married Mary Mansfield in December the same year.<ref name=\"bt12\">{{cite book |last=Tarran |first=Bruce |date=2013 |title=George Hillyard: The Man Who Moved Wimbledon |location=Kibworth Beauchamp |publisher=Matador |isbn=978-1780885490 | pages=1\u20132 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1877, George senior sent his 13-year-old son to the [[Royal Navy]]. At first, he came to the [[Britannia Royal Naval College]] as a [[Naval cadet|cadet]]. In 1879, he was promoted to [[midshipman]] and was assigned to {{HMS|Bacchante|1876|6}} which toured the colonies of the [[British Empire]] around the world from 1880 to 1882. Among his fellow midshipmen were [[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale|Prince Albert]] and Prince George (later King [[George V]]).<ref name=\"bt56\">{{cite book |last=Tarran |first=Bruce |date=2013 |title=George Hillyard: The Man Who Moved Wimbledon |location=Kibworth Beauchamp |publisher=Matador |isbn=978-1780885490 | pages=5\u20136 }}</ref>\n\nHillyard resigned from the Navy with the rank of [[sub-lieutenant]] on 2 October 1885. His last posting was aboard {{HMS|Minotaur|1863|6}}.<ref name=\"bt8\">{{cite book |last=Tarran |first=Bruce |date=2013 |title=George Hillyard: The Man Who Moved Wimbledon |location=Kibworth Beauchamp |publisher=Matador |isbn=978-1780885490 | pages=8 }}</ref>\n\n=== Marriage and tennis career ===\nHillyard had been already introduced to tennis at the age of ten by his uncle, who had set up a [[Sphairistike]] court in 1875. However, he didn't like what he called \"pat-ball\" at first, and preferred cricket. After his Navy service, however, the rules of the game had undergone significant changes and Hillyard became attracted to it.<ref name=\"bt17\">{{cite book |last=Tarran |first=Bruce |date=2013 |title=George Hillyard: The Man Who Moved Wimbledon |location=Kibworth Beauchamp |publisher=Matador |isbn=978-1780885490 | page=17 }}</ref> From 1887, he began to play tournaments.<ref name=\"bt55\">{{cite book |last=Tarran |first=Bruce |date=2013 |title=George Hillyard: The Man Who Moved Wimbledon |location=Kibworth Beauchamp |publisher=Matador |isbn=978-1780885490 | page=55 }}</ref>\n\nHillyard married [[Blanche Bingley]] (1863\u20131946) in [[Greenford]] on 13 July 1887, one week after the Wimbledon final.<ref name=\"bt11\">{{cite book |last=Tarran |first=Bruce |date=2013 |title=George Hillyard: The Man Who Moved Wimbledon |location=Kibworth Beauchamp |publisher=Matador |isbn=978-1780885490 | pages=11 }}</ref> Blanche was the daughter of a wealthy tailoring business proprietor from London, and a successful tennis player. She had won the Wimbledon Championships in the previous year, and would win another five singles titles at Wimbledon alone until 1900. Blanche brought a considerable fortune into the marriage. Only five days after the wedding, the newly married couple competed at the Middlesex Championships at [[Chiswick Park]], and won the mixed doubles title.<ref name=\"bt11\" />\n\nIn 1889, Hillyard played the Wimbledon singles for the first time. He lost his quarter-final match against [[Harry S. Barlow|Harry Barlow]] in straight sets. He reached the doubles final twice at Wimbledon with [[Ernest Lewis]] in 1889 and 1890, but lost to the Renshaw brothers and [[Joshua Pim]] and [[Frank Stoker]], respectively. Alongside [[Harry Scrivener]], he won the doubles title at the [[British Covered Court Championships]] in 1890 and 1891. The following years, his focus shifted again to cricket, playing for Leicestershire, until 1896 when he won the singles, doubles, singles handicap and mixed doubles (with his wife) at [[Monte-Carlo Masters|Monte Carlo]].<ref name=\"bt6364\">{{cite book |last=Tarran |first=Bruce |date=2013 |title=George Hillyard: The Man Who Moved Wimbledon |location=Kibworth Beauchamp |publisher=Matador |isbn=978-1780885490 | pages=63\u201364 }}</ref> In 1897, he won the first staging of the [[German Open Tennis Championships|International German Championships]] at [[Hamburg]], beating [[George Ball-Greene]] in five sets in the final. He repeated his success at Hamburg in 1900. At Wimbledon singles, early losses enabled him to win the [[All England Plate]] in 1898, and reach the final in 1899. At the 1901 Wimbledon singles, he beat [[Laurence Doherty]] in the third round before losing in the quarter-finals to [[Arthur Gore (tennis)|Arthur Gore]].<ref name=\"bt82\">{{cite book |last=Tarran |first=Bruce |date=2013 |title=George Hillyard: The Man Who Moved Wimbledon |location=Kibworth Beauchamp |publisher=Matador |isbn=978-1780885490 | page=82}}</ref>\n\nIn 1905, at 41 years of age, Hillyard lost the final at the [[Bad Homburg]] tournament against [[Anthony Wilding]]. He entered the Wimbledon Championships 1906, conceding a walkover to Arthur Gore. Being assigned secretary of the [[All England Club]] in 1907, he never entered the Championships again. However, he did continue to play minor tournaments such as at [[Eastbourne]], [[Yorkshire]] and Leicester until 1914. After the [[World War I|Great War]], at 55 years of age, he competed at his home tournament at Leicester and even won the mixed doubles alongside [[Gwendoline Eastlake-Smith|Gladys Lamplough]].<ref name=\"bt40\">{{cite book |last=Tarran |first=Bruce |date=2013 |title=George Hillyard: The Man Who Moved Wimbledon |location=Kibworth Beauchamp |publisher=Matador |isbn=978-1780885490 | pages=40 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1908, he competed at the [[1908 Summer Olympics|London Olympic Games]] and won the gold medal in doubles alongside [[Reginald Doherty]]. However, although being great fan of the Olympics in general, he was less enthusiastic about the idea of tennis being a part of it. In his book ''Forty Years of First Class Lawn Tennis'', published in 1924, he wrote: \"As for lawn tennis in conjunction with the Olympic Games, the whole thing is a inconguous farce. You could as well have Olympic cricket or Olympic golf. It is difficult to believe that players or public can treat the matter seriously or care two straws about it. Why it is wanted, or tolerated, when we already have the Davis Cup, is beyond my comprehension.\"<ref name=\"bt115\">{{cite book |last=Tarran |first=Bruce |date=2013 |title=George Hillyard: The Man Who Moved Wimbledon |location=Kibworth Beauchamp |publisher=Matador |isbn=978-1780885490 | pages=115}}</ref>\n\nHillyard was ranked World No. 5 for 1901 by Karoly Mazak.<ref name=\"Mazak\"/>\n\n=== Cricket ===\n[[File:LordHawkesTeaminAmerica1891.jpg|thumb|Lord Hawke's cricket team to North America in 1891/92. Hillyard is in the back row, 2nd from left.]]\nDuring his time at the Navy, Hillyard played a lot of different sports, but concentrated on cricket, and even was captain of the cricket team for two years. Afterwards, he made his first appearance for [[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex]] against the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] in 1886. Although initially quite successful, he soon thereafter realized he had great difficulties to compete on a first-class level. Consequently, from 1887 to 1890 he virtually retired, blaming his time at the Navy which allegedly had prevented him from practising more. However, in 1891, he took cricket up again and played some first-class matches for the MCC as well as the [[Gentlemen v Players|Gentlemen Players]]. Later that year, he participated in a [[Lord Hawke's XI cricket team in North America in 1891\u201392|trip of English cricketers to North America]] led by [[Martin Hawke, 7th Baron Hawke|Lord Hawke]] in winter 1891/92. There, Hillyard played both first-class matches at [[Philadelphia]]. In 1894, Lord Hawke arranged another trip to [[Lord Hawke's XI cricket team in North America in 1894|North America]], and Hillyard was again member of the party. At Philadelphia, he played in front of an audience of 10,000.<ref name=\"bt131133\">{{cite book |last=Tarran |first=Bruce |date=2013 |title=George Hillyard: The Man Who Moved Wimbledon |location=Kibworth Beauchamp |publisher=Matador |isbn=978-1780885490 | pages=131\u2013133 }}</ref>\n\nUpon his return, Hillyard occasionally played cricket for another two years, making a total of 49 first-class matches in his career. After 1896, he fully committed himself to tennis.<ref name=\"bt135\">{{cite book |last=Tarran |first=Bruce |date=2013 |title=George Hillyard: The Man Who Moved Wimbledon |location=Kibworth Beauchamp |publisher=Matador |isbn=978-1780885490 | pages=135 }}</ref>\n\n=== Thorpe Satchville ===\nHillyard and his wife lived at [[Leicestershire]] from at least 1893. In 1896, they moved into a large house with extensive grounds at [[Thorpe Satchville]], a small village near [[Leicester]]. The mansion provided nine bedrooms as well as two tennis courts and a nine-hole golf course.<ref name=\"bt3839\">{{cite book |last=Tarran |first=Bruce |date=2013 |title=George Hillyard: The Man Who Moved Wimbledon |location=Kibworth Beauchamp |publisher=Matador |isbn=978-1780885490 | pages=38\u201339 }}</ref> The Hillyards frequently hosted popular house parties with tennis champions such as [[Norman Brookes]], [[Harold Mahony]], [[Anthony Wilding]], [[May Sutton]], [[Violet Pinckney]] and [[Dora Boothby]] as guests. Until 1914, almost every strong foreign player who played at Wimbledon stayed at the home of the Hillyards.<ref name=\"bt82\"/>\n\n=== Secretary of the AEC, En-tout-cas ===\nHillyard, a long-time member of the [[All England Club]] along with his wife, was its secretary from 1907 to early 1925. One of his major concerns was the upkeep of the courts, and he insisted on high standards of court maintenance. In 1910, the club purchased a motor roller for the courts in order to replace the horse roller.<ref name=\"bt97\">{{cite book |last=Tarran |first=Bruce |date=2013 |title=George Hillyard: The Man Who Moved Wimbledon |location=Kibworth Beauchamp |publisher=Matador |isbn=978-1780885490 | pages=97 }}</ref>\n\nWith the success of the Wimbledon tournament, the necessity to move the ground from his initial location at Worple Road to a larger site became obvious. This had been discussed as early as Hillyard became secretary in 1907, but searching for a better suitable site took time, and the outbreak of World War I further postponed the issue. From 1914 to 1918, Hillyard rejoined the Navy, leaving it with the rank of [[commander]].<ref name=\"bt122\">{{cite book |last=Tarran |first=Bruce |date=2013 |title=George Hillyard: The Man Who Moved Wimbledon |location=Kibworth Beauchamp |publisher=Matador |isbn=978-1780885490 | pages=122}}</ref> After the war, the decision to build a new ground was confirmed in 1919. The new site was opened at the [[1922 Wimbledon Championships]]. After the [[1919 Wimbledon Championships]], the decision to build a new ground was confirmed. As the secretary, Hillyard was probably heavily involved in the search for, and selection of the new site at Church Road, and worked together with architect [[Stanley Peach]].<ref name=\"bt99\">{{cite book |last=Tarran |first=Bruce |date=2013 |title=George Hillyard: The Man Who Moved Wimbledon |location=Kibworth Beauchamp |publisher=Matador |isbn=978-1780885490 | pages=99 }}</ref> The new site was opened at the [[1922 Wimbledon Championships]].\n[[File:G w hillyard, eastbourne.jpg|thumb|George Hillyard at Eastbourne]]\nBeside his secretary post, Hillyard also was an umpire at Wimbledon. From 1919 to 1932, he umpired every ladies final.<ref name=\"bt128\">{{cite book |last=Tarran |first=Bruce |date=2013 |title=George Hillyard: The Man Who Moved Wimbledon |location=Kibworth Beauchamp |publisher=Matador |isbn=978-1780885490 | pages=128 }}</ref>\n\nBeing passionate about building perfect grass courts, Hillyard kept thinking about how to construct an equally good all-weather court. In 1909, he met Claude Brown, a manager of a nearly bankrupt brickyard at [[Syston]] near Leicester. Hillyard had been on a tennis tour in South Africa the winter before where he had played on courts made of crushed up ant heaps. He told this story to Brown, and both developed the idea of using crushed bricks for court surface. The first court was laid out at Hillyard's home at Thorpe Satchville, and was called ''En-tout-cas'' (literally \"in all cases\") upon the idea of a guest, a French lady. Brown renamed his company after it.<ref name=\"bt120121\">{{cite book |last=Tarran |first=Bruce |date=2013 |title=George Hillyard: The Man Who Moved Wimbledon |location=Kibworth Beauchamp |publisher=Matador |isbn=978-1780885490 | pages=120\u2013121 }}</ref> By 1914, business boomed across England. An agent was hired for the United States market, and the company turned into a multimillion-pound business. When the Championships moved to its new site at Church Road in 1922, nine en-tout-cas courts were laid beside the grass courts. For many years, the British Junior Championships were played on en-tous-cas.<ref name=\"bt123124\">{{cite book |last=Tarran |first=Bruce |date=2013 |title=George Hillyard: The Man Who Moved Wimbledon |location=Kibworth Beauchamp |publisher=Matador |isbn=978-1780885490 | pages=123\u2013124 }}</ref>\n\nHillyard's relationship to the En-tout-cas company throughout the years is somewhat diffuse. Clearly, he was in the perfect position to promote the court surface, and he was certainly involved in the decision to construct en-tout-cas courts at the new Wimbledon grounds, giving them a marketing coup. In 1929, when being involved in the construction of a golf course \u2013 a job which was given to En-tout-cas on Hillyard's recommendation \u2013, he eventually disclosed that he was a director of En-tout-cas, thus obviously receiving income from the company.<ref name=\"bt155\">{{cite book |last=Tarran |first=Bruce |date=2013 |title=George Hillyard: The Man Who Moved Wimbledon |location=Kibworth Beauchamp |publisher=Matador |isbn=978-1780885490 | pages=155 }}</ref>\n\n=== Final years ===\nIn 1925, at an age of 61, Hillyard resigned from his position as secretary of the All England Club. In the same year, he sold his house at Thorpe Satchville, and the Hillyards moved to [[Bramfold]], [[Pulborough]], [[Sussex]]. Their new house was of similar size, and Hillyard again constructed two tennis courts,<ref name=\"bt148\">{{cite book |last=Tarran |first=Bruce |date=2013 |title=George Hillyard: The Man Who Moved Wimbledon |location=Kibworth Beauchamp |publisher=Matador |isbn=978-1780885490 | pages=148\u2013149 }}</ref> but began to focus on playing golf. Upon his initiative, a new golf course was completed at the West Sussex Golf Club, and opened on 8 August 1930.<ref name=\"bt155\"/>\n\nHillyard died at his home on 25 March 1943, aged 79. His wife Blanche was to survive him for three years. The couple had two children, [[Jack Hillyard|Jack]] (1890\u20131983) and Marjorie (1895\u2013?).
