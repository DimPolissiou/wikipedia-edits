He asked his servants to wipe it.\n:After the stone den was wiped, he tried to eat those ten lions.\n:When he ate, he realized that these ten lions were in fact ten stone lion corpses.\n:Try to explain this matter.\n\n==Explanation==\n\nClassical Chinese is a written language and is very different from spoken Chinese. Different words that have the same sound when spoken aloud will have different written forms, comparable to ''deer'' and ''dear'' in English.\n\nAlso, many characters in the passage had distinct sounds in [[Middle Chinese]]. All the various Chinese spoken variants have over time merged and split different sounds. For example, when the same passage is read in [[Cantonese]], there are seven distinct syllables - ''ci'', ''sai'', ''sap'', ''sat'', ''sek'', ''si'', ''sik'' - in six distinct tone contours, leaving 22 distinct character pronunciations. In [[Min Nan]] or [[Taiwanese Minnan|Taiwanese]], there are six distinct syllables - ''se'', ''si'', ''su'', ''sek'', ''sip'', ''sit'' \u2013 in seven distinct tone contours, leaving 15 character pronunciations. Even with [[Teochew dialect|Dioziu]] (Chaozhou/Teochew), there are eleven distinct syllables - ''ci'', ''cik'', ''sai'', ''se'', ''sek'', ''si'', ''sip'', ''sik'', ''chap'', ''chiah'', ''chioh'' - in six distinct tone contours, leaving 22 distinct character pronunciations. The passage is barely comprehensible when read aloud in any modern dialect including Mandarin.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n{|width=\"100%\"\n|-\n|\n;[[Cantonese]]

The poem is coherent and grammatical in [[Classical Chinese]], but the loss of older sound combinations in Chinese over the centuries has greatly increased the number of Chinese homophones, making Classical Chinese difficult to understand in oral speech. In Mandarin, the poem is incomprehensible when read aloud, since only four syllables cover the entire 92 words of the poem. The poem is less incomprehensible\u2014but still not very intelligible\u2014when read in other varieties of Chinese such as [[Cantonese]], in which it has 22 different syllables, or [[Hokkien Chinese]], in which it has 15 different syllables.\n\nThe poem is an example of a [[one-syllable article]], a form of [[constrained writing]] possible in tonal languages such as Mandarin Chinese, where tonal contours expand the range of meaning for a single syllable.\n\n==Explanation==\nChinese is a [[tonal language]] in which subtle changes in pronunciation could change the meaning.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The Etymologicon : a Circular Stroll through the Hidden Connections of the English Language.|last=Forsyth, Mark.|date=2011|publisher=Icon Books|isbn=9781848313224|location=Cambridge|pages=62\u201363|oclc=782875800}}</ref> In [[Romanization|Romanized script]], the poem is an example of the [[antanaclasis]] in Chinese.<ref name=\":0\" /> The poem shows the flexibility of the Chinese language in many ways, including wording, syntax, [[punctuation]] and sentence structures, which gives rise to various explanations.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hengxing|first=He|date=2018-02-01|title=The Discourse Flexibility of Zhao Yuanren [Yuen Ren Chao]'s Homophonic Text|journal=Journal of Chinese Linguistics|language=en|volume=46|issue=1|pages=149\u2013176|doi=10.1353/jcl.2018.0005|issn=2411-3484}}</ref> \n\nThe poem could be misinterpreted as objection to the [[Romanization of Chinese]].

However, when it is in its transcribed Romanized form or in its spoken Mandarin form, it becomes confusing.<ref name=\":2\" /> Many words in the passage had distinct sounds in [[Middle Chinese]]. All of the [[Varieties of Chinese|variants of spoken Chinese]] have, over time, merged and split different sounds. For example, when the same passage is read in [[Cantonese]] (even modern Cantonese) there are seven distinct syllables\u2014''ci'', ''sai'', ''sap'', ''sat'', ''sek'', ''si'', ''sik''\u2014in six distinct tone contours, producing 22 distinct character pronunciations. In [[Southern Min]], there are six distinct syllables\u2014''se'', ''si'', ''su'', ''sek'', ''sip'', ''sit''\u2014in seven distinct tone contours, producing fifteen character pronunciations. Therefore, the passage is barely comprehensible when read aloud in modern Mandarin without context, but easier to understand when read in other Sinitic languages, such as Cantonese.\n\n==See also==\n===Related puns===\n* [[Homophonic puns in Mandarin Chinese]]\n* [[List of linguistic example sentences]]\n* [[James while John had had had had had had had had had had had a better effect on the teacher]]\n* [[Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo]]\n* [[Neko no ko koneko, shishi no ko kojishi]]\n\n===Chinese===\n* [[Languages of China]]\n* [[List of varieties of Chinese]]\n* [[:zh:\u540c\u97f3\u6587\u7ae0|A list of other Classical Chinese texts based entirely on modern homophones]] in [[Chinese Wikipedia]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.pinyin.info/readings/zyg/what_pinyin_is_not.html The Three \"NOTs\" of Hanyu Pinyin] has a similar but different text, and it explains that Yuen Ren Chao's intention was not to oppose Chinese Romanization.\n* {{lang|zh-hans|[http://www.sutrapearls.org/duilian/du30.htm \u5c0d\u806f\uff1a30. \u5de7\u806f\u5999\u5c0d]}}\n* [https://chinesepod.com/blog/2014/10/25/how-to-read-a-chinese-poem-with-only-one-sound/ How to Read a Chinese Poem with Only One Sound] has a transcription of the passage in Traditional and Simplified Chinese, as well as a Pinyin transcription and a translation.\n\n[[Category:Romanization of Chinese]]\n[[Category:Chinese poems]]\n[[Category:Constrained writing]]\n[[Category:Chinese language]]\n[[Category:Language games]]\n[[Category:Homonymy]]\n[[Category:Homonymy in Chinese]]\n", "name_user": "2601:647:4d80:3190:2c04:2f6e:c06:339a", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u77f3\u5ba4\u8bd7\u58eb\u65bd\u6c0f\uff0c\u55dc\u72ee\uff0c\u8a93\u98df\u5341\u72ee\u3002 \u6c0f\u65f6\u65f6\u9002\u5e02\u89c6\u72ee\u3002 \u5341\u65f6\uff0c\u9002\u5341\u72ee\u9002\u5e02\u3002 \u662f\u65f6\uff0c\u9002\u65bd\u6c0f\u9002\u5e02\u3002 \u6c0f\u89c6\u662f\u5341\u72ee\uff0c\u6043\u77e2\u52bf\uff0c\u4f7f\u662f\u5341\u72ee\u901d\u4e16\u3002 \u6c0f\u62fe\u662f\u5341\u72ee\u5c38\uff0c\u9002\u77f3\u5ba4\u3002 \u77f3\u5ba4\u6e7f\uff0c\u6c0f\u4f7f\u4f8d\u62ed\u77f3\u5ba4\u3002\u77f3\u5ba4\u62ed\uff0c\u6c0f\u59cb\u8bd5\u98df\u662f\u5341\u72ee\u3002 :\u98df\u65f6\uff0c\u59cb\u8bc6\u662f\u5341\u72ee\u5c38\uff0c\u5b9e\u5341\u77f3\u72ee\u5c38\u3002 :\u8bd5\u91ca\u662f\u4e8b\u3002)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion-Eating_Poet_in_the_Stone_Den"}

A total of 14,600 people lived in the city of Zvornik, 8,942 (61.0%) of them were Bosniaks, 4,281 (29.2%) of the Serbian nationality, 74 (0.5%) of [[Croat]]ian nationality, and 1,363 (9.3 per cent) were defined as \"others\".<ref name=\"UN\"/> \n\nAs a border town situated at the Bosnian-Serb [[Drina river]], Zvornik was of great strategic importance. It is significant because [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Serbia]] are linked at that point not only through a road bridge between the Zvornik urban area and the Karakaj industrial zone, and another one in Zvornik itself, but also via a railroad bridge between Karakaj and the town of \u010celopek. It represents an important link along the [[Belgrade]]-Sarajevo line, as well as within the Belgrade-[[Tuzla]] line.<ref name=\"UN\"/>\n\nOfficially, there was no garrison of the former [[Yugoslav People's Army|JNA]] in the Zvornik district. The Zvornik region itself was controlled by the 17th Corps Tuzla. Up to the fall of 1991, the 17th Corps consisted of 3 brigades and one partisan brigade, and was part of the First Military District of Belgrade. After the re-organization of the JNA in the spring of 1992, it formally fell under the command of the Second Military District of Sarajevo, but most likely continued to be led by the First Military District of Belgrade.<ref name=\"UN\"/> \n\nBy 1991-92, preliminary tank units (apparently from the abandoned [[Jastrebarsko]] garrison in [[Croatia]]) were stationed near Zvornik. By February or March 1992 (at the time of the referendum on independence), additional units of the former JNA-tank units and artillery and anti-aircraft positions were stationed in the Zvornik region. Initially, the tanks still carried the JNA emblems. It was only later that they were replaced by the Serbian flag and the coat-of-arms emblem. On the Serb side of the Drina river bank, various tank positions could be identified as well. Additional forces, including [[artillery]], [[anti-aircraft]] weaponry, and [[tank]]s were being positioned there.<ref name=\"UN\"/>\n\n==Attack on Zvornik==\n===Build-up===\n[[File:D-30 VRS.JPEG|right|thumb|250px|The [[Army of the Republika Srpska]] (VRS) soldiers of Headquarters 503rd Brigade, display two 122mm D-30 howitzers at a weapons storage site located in Zvornik, Bosnia-Herzegovina, during an inspection]]\nThe attack on Zvornik started on 8 April 1992, just a few days after the [[Bijeljina massacre|Serb seizure of Bijeljina]]. According to witness accounts, former JNA troops from the following garrisons were involved during the attack:<ref name=\"UN\"/>\n{{bquote|Tuzla garrison: some of the tanks used in Zvornik were part of the units which were transferred from Jastrebarsko ([[Croatia]]) to Tuzla.<br>\n[[Bijeljina]] garrison: The infantry divisions of the former JNA were reserve units of the mobilization base, Bijeljina.}}\n\nPlanes and helicopters which participated were reportedly from Tuzla. Prior to the attack, units from [[Novi Sad]], [[\u0160abac]], [[Sremska Mitrovica]] and [[Valjevo]] (Serbia) were partly stationed along the Serbian side of the Drina river bank, and partly on the Bosnian side. They further participated in the attack on Zvornik, operating from Serbian territory. They were equipped with [[machine-gun]]s (M 52, [[M 65]], M 66, M 70A, M 70B, M 72); [[hand grenade|hand grenade launchers]] (Zolja); [[AK-47|kalashnikovs]]; [[MiG 21]] and [[J-21 Jastreb]]  \n with machine-guns and gunners; helicopters ([[MT 6]] or MT 8 and others); and knives. Infantry units were not only composed of the \u00abregular members\u00bb of the former JNA and of mobilized reserve forces, but also of \u00abvolunteers\u00bb<ref name=\"UN\"/>\n\n===The attack===\nThe military attack on Zvornik occurred on 8 April 1992. Later, there were sporadic military operations with units of the former JNA cooperating with paramilitary units. These operations mainly focused on the medieval fortress of Kulagrad, southwest of Zvornik, where some dozen resistance fighters were holding out. However, on 26 April, this fortress was conquered in a concerted attack by former JNA troops, with air support, and by [[paramilitary]] units. Immediately after the fall of Kulagrad, the town of Divi\u0107, situated south of Zvornik, was attacked. Divi\u0107 was almost exclusively populated by Bosniaks and was situated at the hydro-electric power plant. The attack on the town was conducted both from the Serbian side and from Bosnian territory, using tank forces, artillery, and infantry units with portable [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]]s. JNA units and paramilitary units cooperated. [[Arkanovci]] operated in front-line positions, taking the city. Their core troops left the city after the successful attack to prepare a raid on the next city, [[Bratunac]].<ref name=\"UN\"/>\n\nThe attack began on the morning of 8 April, with mortar fire on the Bukovik and Meterize city districts, as well as on the [[Bosniak]]-held defence positions on the Debelo Brdo hill. It came from the artillery positions in Karakaj, from the Bosnian side before Meterize, and from the Serbian side of the River Drina ([[Mali Zvornik]]). First shots were fired in the Meterize suburb. This attack was mainly carried out by the heavy equipment of the JNA (artillery and tanks). There are also reports of Arkanovci snipers firing from Mali Zvornik on the opposite river bank, and of snipers aiming at residents from positions on highrise buildings in Zvornik itself. The Bosniak position on Debelo Brdo, however, fell on that same day and was occupied.<ref name=\"UN\"/>\n\nDuring the night there was heavy shelling of the town. The capture of the city did not begin until the following day, 9 April. In the morning, there were again negotiations with [[Arkan]], which ended in an ultimatum for the surrender of weapons and the town by 8:00 a.m. At 8:00 a.m. artillery fire started again, followed by the capture of the town by the infantry. The Arkanovci {{clarify|date=May 2015}} assumed a leading role in the take-over of the city, proceeding from the north via the Bukovik and Meterize city districts heading for the city centre. In addition, infantry units of the JNA in cooperation with Serb volunteers ([[White Eagles (paramilitary)|Seseljovci, Beli Orlovi]]) took part in seizing the city. They approached the city primarily from the west, in a second wave. It was reported that on the very first day, as well as during the subsequent weeks, there were random executions, rapes, and [[massacre]]s. In these, the units of the Seseljovci, Beli Orlovi and the so-called \"territorial defence\" were also involved. On 10 and 11 April, Zvornik was captured. The Kulagrad fortress north of Zvornik and the town of Divi\u0107 bordering Zvornik to the South had not yet been occupied.<ref name=\"UN\"/> \n\nOn 9 April, artillery attacks on Kulagrad started as the attacking units were expecting major Bosniak resistance forces. Even before the attack, Serbian media reported that \"several thousand Bosniak extremists\" were hiding in Kulagrad. In fact, there were probably no more than a few dozen armed Bosniaks under the command of a former JNA officer who spontaneously organized a resistance movement with light equipment (small arms). From 11 April onward, there were almost daily attempts by small combat groups from various paramilitary units to capture the fortress. These attempts failed, however, despite the fact that Kulagrad was constantly under fire from mortars, anti- aircraft guns and tanks. The reason for this failure might be due to the apparent lack of coordination of the attacks, as well as deficiencies in the training of the infantry units involved. These settlements were captured by May.<ref name=\"UN\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:960228-A-5792S-005 - Serbian officer shows U.S. soldiers a towed ZiS-3 anti-tank gun.jpg|right|thumb|250px|COL Pandurevic, Commander 1st Zvornik Brigade, Republic of Serbia Army, shows LTC Anthony Harriman, Squadron Commander, 3rd Squadron, 4th Cavalry Regiment, 2nd Brigade, 1st Armored Division, Baumholder, Germany, a ZIS-3 Towed Anti-tank Gun during an inspection of a Serbian cantonment area on 28 February 1996 during [[Operation Joint Endeavor]]]]\nAround 10 or 11 April, the \u00abordinance on the introduction of the general work requirement\u00bb, along with an extension of the deadline, was broadcast by Radio Zvornik. But this appeal was not followed, as there were still numerous paramilitary troops in town who were looting and terrorizing the locals. Therefore, the appeal was broadcast once more a few days later (approximately 15 or 16 April). The overall response to these appeals was however rather poor. The experiences of those who did follow the appeal to return to the workplace showed that the true purpose of this appeal, and of others that followed, was to monitor male Bosniak inhabitants.<ref name=\"UN\"/> \n\nImmediately after the occupation of the town, a night [[curfew]] was imposed which remained in force until the \u00ab[[ethnic cleansing]]\u00bb was completed. During the day, men were allowed to move around only with a permit issued by the Serbian police at Zvornik. Many of the men who went to Karakaj (or later to the police office in Zvornik) in order to apply for a \u00abpermit\u00bb were suddenly deported into one of the camps in the industrial district of [[Karakaj]]. While at the camp, they were subjected to severe torture and murder, in particular by members of the paramilitary troops whose quarters were partly in the same buildings as those in which the prisoners were detained. Many of the men, therefore, did not dare to pick up their passes themselves, but remained in hiding in houses. However, even persons with a pass were not safe from random aggressions by the numerous paramilitary units in town. It was reported by some witnesses that immediately upon leaving the police station, they had their passes taken away or torn into pieces by members of a paramilitary group. Some of them were attacked and deported into camps.<ref name=\"UN\"/>\n\nFrom the onset of the occupation, Bosniaks were prohibited from working, except for persons deemed indispensable (e.g. [[hospital]] personnel, who were not released until the end of May). Everyday life was dominated by the fact that maraudering paramilitary troops, who were not controlled by any authority, terrorized the Bosniak population of Zvornik.<ref name=\"UN\"/>\n\n===Expulsion and organized deportation===\nAfter the [[Population transfer|expulsion]] of the Bosniak population by means of terror, the next step was to prepare the total expulsion of the inhabitants with the support of administrative measures. The first step had already been the appeal to return. The registration of property that was mandatory for all inhabitants, including the Serbian population, served above all the purpose of registering the male Bosniak population. For this reason, only men were eligible for registration, which had to be completed before the Serbian municipality or the Serbian militia, even if a property was originally registered under the wife's name. These registrations led to arrests and deportations to camps, apparently on the basis of pre-established lists.<ref name=\"UN\"/> \n\nAn \u00abagency for the exchange of houses\u00bb was set up, to which the Bosniak inhabitants were to transfer their houses. In return, the Bosniaks were promised houses belonging to Bosnian Serbs (e.g. in the [[Tuzla]] region) who supposedly had also assigned their homes to the agency. In order to make this ostensible [[population transfer|offer to exchange houses]] more appealing, Serbian radio stations transmitted broadcasts regarding the successful exchange of homes by prominent Bosniak inhabitants. These exchanges were, in many cases, found out to be falsified or conducted under coercion.<ref name=\"UN\"/>\n\nDeparture from the town was only possible on the condition that property was renounced and transferred to the ''Serbian District of Zvornik''. These transfers were executed in cooperation with the police and paramilitary units, especially the [[Draganovci]]. Documents that had to be shown upon leaving the town included:<ref name=\"UN\"/>\n*a personal [[Identity card|ID]] card, in which the date of the notice of change of address was entered by the authority.\n*a permit which guaranteed the holder the freedom of movement on the territory of the ''Serbian District of Zvornik'' and the access to the territory of the [[FRY]].\n*a stub certifying the \u00abchange of [[address (geography)|address]]\u00bb\n\n==Legal proceedings==\n===ICTY===\nThe U.N. established [[International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY) issued several indictments for crimes after the capture of Zvornik. In its verdicts, it found the Serb officials guilty of [[persecution]], [[forcible transfer]] and/or [[deportation]], [[murder]], [[Imprisonment|unlawful detention]], [[torture]] ([[crimes against humanity]]) and wanton destruction, [[plunder]] of property (violations of [[law of war]]): \n\n*[[Radovan Karad\u017ei\u0107]], former President of Republika Srpska, was sentenced to a [[life in prison]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Bosnia-Herzegovina: Karad\u017ei\u0107 life sentence sends powerful message to the world| publisher=Amnesty International|url= https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2019/03/bosnia-herzegovina-karadzic-life-sentence-sends-powerful-message-to-the-world/| date=20 March 2019|accessdate=10 April 2019}}</ref>\n*[[Mi\u0107o Stani\u0161i\u0107]], Minister of the Serbian Ministry of Internal Affairs in Bosnia and Herzegovina, was sentenced to 22 years in prison.<ref name=\"Zupljanin CIS\">{{cite web |title=Mico Stanisic and Stojan Zupljanin; Case Information Sheet|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/zupljanin_stanisicm/cis/en/cis_stanisic_zupljanin_en.pdf|publisher=International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia |p=250, 262|date=|accessdate=19 January 2019}}</ref>\n*[[Stojan \u017dupljanin]], Chief of the Regional Security Services Centre of Banja Luka; member of the Autonomous Region of Krajina (ARK) Crisis Staff, was sentenced to 22 years.<ref name=\"Zupljanin CIS\"/>\n*[[Mom\u010dilo Kraji\u0161nik]] was sentenced to 20 years.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mom\u010dilo Kraji\u0161nik; Case Information Sheet| url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/krajisnik/cis/en/cis_krajisnik_en.pdf|publisher=International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia |p=250, 262|date=|accessdate=19 January 2019}}</ref>\n*[[Biljana Plav\u0161i\u0107]] was sentenced to 11 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/plavsic/tjug/en/pla-tj030227e.pdf|title=Prosecutor v.

A total of 14,600 people lived in the city of Zvornik, 8,942 (61.0%) of them were Bosniaks, 4,281 (29.2%) of the Serbian nationality, 74 (0.5%) of [[Croat]]ian nationality, and 1,363 (9.3 per cent) were defined as \"others\".<ref name=\"UN\"/> \n\nAs a border town situated at the Bosnian-Serb [[Drina river]], Zvornik was of great strategic importance. It is significant because [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Serbia]] are linked at that point not only through a road bridge between the Zvornik urban area and the Karakaj industrial zone, and another one in Zvornik itself, but also via a railroad bridge between Karakaj and the town of \u010celopek. It represents an important link along the [[Belgrade]]-Sarajevo line, as well as within the Belgrade-[[Tuzla]] line.<ref name=\"UN\"/>\n\nOfficially, there was no garrison of the former [[Yugoslav People's Army|JNA]] in the Zvornik district. The Zvornik region itself was controlled by the 17th Corps Tuzla. Up to the fall of 1991, the 17th Corps consisted of 3 brigades and one partisan brigade, and was part of the First Military District of Belgrade. After the re-organization of the JNA in the spring of 1992, it formally fell under the command of the Second Military District of Sarajevo, but most likely continued to be led by the First Military District of Belgrade.<ref name=\"UN\"/> \n\nBy 1991-92, preliminary tank units (apparently from the abandoned [[Jastrebarsko]] garrison in [[Croatia]]) were stationed near Zvornik. By February or March 1992 (at the time of the referendum on independence), additional units of the former JNA-tank units and artillery and anti-aircraft positions were stationed in the Zvornik region. Initially, the tanks still carried the JNA emblems. It was only later that they were replaced by the Serbian flag and the coat-of-arms emblem. On the Serb side of the Drina river bank, various tank positions could be identified as well. Additional forces, including [[artillery]], [[anti-aircraft]] weaponry, and [[tank]]s were being positioned there.<ref name=\"UN\"/>\n\n==Attack on Zvornik==\n===Build-up===\n[[File:D-30 VRS.JPEG|right|thumb|250px|The [[Army of the Republika Srpska]] (VRS) soldiers of Headquarters 503rd Brigade, display two 122mm D-30 howitzers at a weapons storage site located in Zvornik, Bosnia-Herzegovina, during an inspection]]\nThe attack on Zvornik started on 8 April 1992, just a few days after the [[Bijeljina massacre|Serb seizure of Bijeljina]]. According to witness accounts, former JNA troops from the following garrisons were involved during the attack:<ref name=\"UN\"/>\n{{bquote|Tuzla garrison: some of the tanks used in Zvornik were part of the units which were transferred from Jastrebarsko ([[Croatia]]) to Tuzla.<br>\n[[Bijeljina]] garrison: The infantry divisions of the former JNA were reserve units of the mobilization base, Bijeljina.}}\n\nPlanes and helicopters which participated were reportedly from Tuzla. Prior to the attack, units from [[Novi Sad]], [[\u0160abac]], [[Sremska Mitrovica]] and [[Valjevo]] (Serbia) were partly stationed along the Serbian side of the Drina river bank, and partly on the Bosnian side. They further participated in the attack on Zvornik, operating from Serbian territory. They were equipped with [[machine-gun]]s (M 52, [[M 65]], M 66, M 70A, M 70B, M 72); [[hand grenade|hand grenade launchers]] (Zolja); [[AK-47|kalashnikovs]]; [[MiG 21]] and [[J-21 Jastreb]]  \n with machine-guns and gunners; helicopters ([[MT 6]] or MT 8 and others); and knives. Infantry units were not only composed of the \u00abregular members\u00bb of the former JNA and of mobilized reserve forces, but also of \u00abvolunteers\u00bb<ref name=\"UN\"/>\n\n===The attack===\nThe military attack on Zvornik occurred on 8 April 1992. Later, there were sporadic military operations with units of the former JNA cooperating with paramilitary units. These operations mainly focused on the medieval fortress of Kulagrad, southwest of Zvornik, where some dozen resistance fighters were holding out. However, on 26 April, this fortress was conquered in a concerted attack by former JNA troops, with air support, and by [[paramilitary]] units. Immediately after the fall of Kulagrad, the town of Divi\u0107, situated south of Zvornik, was attacked. Divi\u0107 was almost exclusively populated by Bosniaks and was situated at the hydro-electric power plant. The attack on the town was conducted both from the Serbian side and from Bosnian territory, using tank forces, artillery, and infantry units with portable [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]]s. JNA units and paramilitary units cooperated. [[Arkanovci]] operated in front-line positions, taking the city. Their core troops left the city after the successful attack to prepare a raid on the next city, [[Bratunac]].<ref name=\"UN\"/>\n\nThe attack began on the morning of 8 April, with mortar fire on the Bukovik and Meterize city districts, as well as on the [[Bosniak]]-held defence positions on the Debelo Brdo hill. It came from the artillery positions in Karakaj, from the Bosnian side before Meterize, and from the Serbian side of the River Drina ([[Mali Zvornik]]). First shots were fired in the Meterize suburb. This attack was mainly carried out by the heavy equipment of the JNA (artillery and tanks). There are also reports of Arkanovci snipers firing from Mali Zvornik on the opposite river bank, and of snipers aiming at residents from positions on highrise buildings in Zvornik itself. The Bosniak position on Debelo Brdo, however, fell on that same day and was occupied.<ref name=\"UN\"/>\n\nDuring the night there was heavy shelling of the town. The capture of the city did not begin until the following day, 9 April. In the morning, there were again negotiations with [[Arkan]], which ended in an ultimatum for the surrender of weapons and the town by 8:00 a.m. At 8:00 a.m. artillery fire started again, followed by the capture of the town by the infantry. The Arkanovci {{clarify|date=May 2015}} assumed a leading role in the take-over of the city, proceeding from the north via the Bukovik and Meterize city districts heading for the city centre. In addition, infantry units of the JNA in cooperation with Serb volunteers ([[White Eagles (paramilitary)|Seseljovci, Beli Orlovi]]) took part in seizing the city. They approached the city primarily from the west, in a second wave. It was reported that on the very first day, as well as during the subsequent weeks, there were random executions, rapes, and [[massacre]]s. In these, the units of the Seseljovci, Beli Orlovi and the so-called \"territorial defence\" were also involved. On 10 and 11 April, Zvornik was captured. The Kulagrad fortress north of Zvornik and the town of Divi\u0107 bordering Zvornik to the South had not yet been occupied.<ref name=\"UN\"/> \n\nOn 9 April, artillery attacks on Kulagrad started as the attacking units were expecting major Bosniak resistance forces. Even before the attack, Serbian media reported that \"several thousand Bosniak extremists\" were hiding in Kulagrad. In fact, there were probably no more than a few dozen armed Bosniaks under the command of a former JNA officer who spontaneously organized a resistance movement with light equipment (small arms). From 11 April onward, there were almost daily attempts by small combat groups from various paramilitary units to capture the fortress. These attempts failed, however, despite the fact that Kulagrad was constantly under fire from mortars, anti- aircraft guns and tanks. The reason for this failure might be due to the apparent lack of coordination of the attacks, as well as deficiencies in the training of the infantry units involved. These settlements were captured by May.<ref name=\"UN\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:960228-A-5792S-005 - Serbian officer shows U.S. soldiers a towed ZiS-3 anti-tank gun.jpg|right|thumb|250px|COL Pandurevic, Commander 1st Zvornik Brigade, Republic of Serbia Army, shows LTC Anthony Harriman, Squadron Commander, 3rd Squadron, 4th Cavalry Regiment, 2nd Brigade, 1st Armored Division, Baumholder, Germany, a ZIS-3 Towed Anti-tank Gun during an inspection of a Serbian cantonment area on 28 February 1996 during [[Operation Joint Endeavor]]]]\nAround 10 or 11 April, the \u00abordinance on the introduction of the general work requirement\u00bb, along with an extension of the deadline, was broadcast by Radio Zvornik. But this appeal was not followed, as there were still numerous paramilitary troops in town who were looting and terrorizing the locals. Therefore, the appeal was broadcast once more a few days later (approximately 15 or 16 April). The overall response to these appeals was however rather poor. The experiences of those who did follow the appeal to return to the workplace showed that the true purpose of this appeal, and of others that followed, was to monitor male Bosniak inhabitants.<ref name=\"UN\"/> \n\nImmediately after the occupation of the town, a night [[curfew]] was imposed which remained in force until the \u00ab[[ethnic cleansing]]\u00bb was completed. During the day, men were allowed to move around only with a permit issued by the Serbian police at Zvornik. Many of the men who went to Karakaj (or later to the police office in Zvornik) in order to apply for a \u00abpermit\u00bb were suddenly deported into one of the camps in the industrial district of [[Karakaj]]. While at the camp, they were subjected to severe torture and murder, in particular by members of the paramilitary troops whose quarters were partly in the same buildings as those in which the prisoners were detained. Many of the men, therefore, did not dare to pick up their passes themselves, but remained in hiding in houses. However, even persons with a pass were not safe from random aggressions by the numerous paramilitary units in town. It was reported by some witnesses that immediately upon leaving the police station, they had their passes taken away or torn into pieces by members of a paramilitary group. Some of them were attacked and deported into camps.<ref name=\"UN\"/>\n\nFrom the onset of the occupation, Bosniaks were prohibited from working, except for persons deemed indispensable (e.g. [[hospital]] personnel, who were not released until the end of May). Everyday life was dominated by the fact that maraudering paramilitary troops, who were not controlled by any authority, terrorized the Bosniak population of Zvornik.<ref name=\"UN\"/>\n\n===Expulsion and organized deportation===\nAfter the [[Population transfer|expulsion]] of the Bosniak population by means of terror, the next step was to prepare the total expulsion of the inhabitants with the support of administrative measures. The first step had already been the appeal to return. The registration of property that was mandatory for all inhabitants, including the Serbian population, served above all the purpose of registering the male Bosniak population. For this reason, only men were eligible for registration, which had to be completed before the Serbian municipality or the Serbian militia, even if a property was originally registered under the wife's name. These registrations led to arrests and deportations to camps, apparently on the basis of pre-established lists.<ref name=\"UN\"/> \n\nAn \u00abagency for the exchange of houses\u00bb was set up, to which the Bosniak inhabitants were to transfer their houses. In return, the Bosniaks were promised houses belonging to Bosnian Serbs (e.g. in the [[Tuzla]] region) who supposedly had also assigned their homes to the agency. In order to make this ostensible [[population transfer|offer to exchange houses]] more appealing, Serbian radio stations transmitted broadcasts regarding the successful exchange of homes by prominent Bosniak inhabitants. These exchanges were, in many cases, found out to be falsified or conducted under coercion.<ref name=\"UN\"/>\n\nDeparture from the town was only possible on the condition that property was renounced and transferred to the ''Serbian District of Zvornik''. These transfers were executed in cooperation with the police and paramilitary units, especially the [[Draganovci]]. Documents that had to be shown upon leaving the town included:<ref name=\"UN\"/>\n*a personal [[Identity card|ID]] card, in which the date of the notice of change of address was entered by the authority.\n*a permit which guaranteed the holder the freedom of movement on the territory of the ''Serbian District of Zvornik'' and the access to the territory of the [[FRY]].\n*a stub certifying the \u00abchange of [[address (geography)|address]]\u00bb\n\n==Legal proceedings==\n===ICTY===\nThe U.N. established [[International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY) issued several indictments for crimes after the capture of Zvornik. In its verdicts, it found the Serb officials guilty of [[persecution]], [[forcible transfer]] and/or [[deportation]], [[murder]], [[Imprisonment|unlawful detention]], [[torture]] ([[crimes against humanity]]) and wanton destruction, [[plunder]] of property (violations of [[law of war]]): \n\n*[[Radovan Karad\u017ei\u0107]], former President of Republika Srpska, was sentenced to a [[life in prison]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Bosnia-Herzegovina: Karad\u017ei\u0107 life sentence sends powerful message to the world| publisher=Amnesty International|url= https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2019/03/bosnia-herzegovina-karadzic-life-sentence-sends-powerful-message-to-the-world/| date=20 March 2019|accessdate=10 April 2019}}</ref>\n*[[Mi\u0107o Stani\u0161i\u0107]], Minister of the Serbian Ministry of Internal Affairs in Bosnia and Herzegovina, was sentenced to 22 years in prison.<ref name=\"Zupljanin CIS\">{{cite web |title=Mico Stanisic and Stojan Zupljanin; Case Information Sheet|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/zupljanin_stanisicm/cis/en/cis_stanisic_zupljanin_en.pdf|publisher=International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia |p=250, 262|date=|accessdate=19 January 2019}}</ref>\n*[[Stojan \u017dupljanin]], Chief of the Regional Security Services Centre of Banja Luka; member of the Autonomous Region of Krajina (ARK) Crisis Staff, was sentenced to 22 years.<ref name=\"Zupljanin CIS\"/>\n*[[Mom\u010dilo Kraji\u0161nik]] was sentenced to 20 years.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mom\u010dilo Kraji\u0161nik; Case Information Sheet| url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/krajisnik/cis/en/cis_krajisnik_en.pdf|publisher=International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia |p=250, 262|date=|accessdate=19 January 2019}}</ref>\n*[[Biljana Plav\u0161i\u0107]] was sentenced to 11 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/plavsic/tjug/en/pla-tj030227e.pdf|title=Prosecutor v.
