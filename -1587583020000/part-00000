Nelson has previously played for [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]], [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], [[Hartlepool United F.C.|Hartlepool United]], [[Bury F.C.|Bury]], [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]], [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]], [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]], [[Cambridge United F.C.|Cambridge United]], [[Barnet F.C.|Barnet]] and [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]].\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Early career===\nBorn in [[Gateshead]], [[Tyne and Wear]], Nelson started his playing career as a semi-professional, playing for [[non-League football|non-League]] teams such as [[Spennymoor United F.C.|Spennymoor United]], [[Leek Town F.C.|Leek Town]] and [[Bishop Auckland F.C.|Bishop Auckland]]. Nelson's performances attracted the attention of league clubs who sent scouts to watch him. Nelson was given a trial at [[Hartlepool United F.C.|Hartlepool]] but he was not offered a contract by the then Hartlepool manager [[Chris Turner (footballer b. 1958)|Chris Turner]]. However Nelson was offered a contract at [[Bury F.C.|Bury]] by manager [[Andy Preece]] after Bury scout Peter Ward convinced him to give Nelson a chance.\n\n===Bury===\nOnce Nelson had settled down to professional football, he gradually became a first team regular and during his first full season at Bury he managed to play 31 of the clubs 46 league matches, scoring 2 goals in the process. Nelson formed a defensive partnership with [[Danny Swailes]]. However, during the season Nelson suffered what he described as ''the worst injury of his career'' after suffering a collapsed lung and several cracked ribs after a collision during Bury's match against [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]]. Nelson had to have a drain inserted into his chest for several days while he was hospitalised. The injury threatened to keep him sidelined for three months but remarkably Nelson was able to resume training less than three weeks later.\n\nDespite being dropped early on, Nelson's second season turned out to be even more successful as he played in 40 of Bury's 46 matches, scoring 5 goals. Nelson was made club captain and his performances earned him the respect of the club's players and fans. During that season, Bury manager Andy Preece hailed Nelson as \"the best centre-half in Division Three\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manchesteronline.co.uk/sport/football/bury/s/58/58059_nelsons_different_class.html|title=Nelson's different class|date=8 May 2003|publisher=Manchester Evening News|accessdate=18 April 2010}}</ref> However, Bury failed to gain promotion to League 1 as they missed out during the play-offs and Nelson was offered the chance to play in a higher division by several League 1 clubs.\n\n===Hartlepool United===\nThe following season, Nelson joined Hartlepool United on the same day that [[Neale Cooper]] was appointed manager for a fee of around \u00a370,000.<ref>{{cite news|title=Nelson sails into Hartlepool|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11756/2269095/|publisher=Sky Sports|date=26 June 2003|accessdate=10 March 2013}}</ref> Nelson was seen as natural replacement for [[Graeme Lee (footballer)|Graeme Lee]] who had joined Sheffield Wednesday. Nelson started strongly for Hartlepool and scored the winner from 30 yards during his debut in Hartlepool's 4\u20133 win over [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough]]. This goal almost earned him another award as it was on the shortlist for Hartlepool's Goal of the Season. He was also voted September's Player of the Month on the official Hartlepool website. Nelson began to form a strong partnership with [[Chris Westwood]] and the pair played together for the majority of Hartlepool's games. Nelson went on to play in 40 of Hartlepool's league matches and played in both legs of Hartlepool's play-off semi-final match against [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]]. Nelson was in contention for Hartlepool's Fans and Players' Player of the season but he missed out to [[Jim Provett]] on both occasions.\n\nHowever Nelson failed to maintain this through to the 2004\u201305 season and he handed in a transfer request.<ref>{{cite news|title=Nelson asks for transfer|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11756/2314645/|publisher=Sky Sports|date=25 October 2004|accessdate=10 March 2013}}</ref> His agent claimed that he'd been \"promised\" a better deal. This triggered a feud with Hartlepool chairman [[Ken Hodcroft]] who criticised Nelson and his agent. Nelson was missing in several of Hartlepool's matches and was rumoured to be signing for [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] for a fee of around \u00a3100,000. However Nelson withdrew his transfer request and was reinstalled into the starting line-up. His performances earned him an improved contract and he was offered a new three-year contract that would tie him to the club until 2008.<ref>{{cite news|title=Nelson stays with Pools|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11756/2341528/|publisher=Sky Sports|date=9 July 2005|accessdate=10 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nNelson's third season of the club saw him receiving his first red card for Hartlepool after he retaliated and elbowed [[Jack Lester]] during Hartlepool's defeat to Nottingham Forest. He was the favoured central defender alongside [[Ben Clark (footballer born 1983)|Ben Clark]] during the [[2006\u201307 in English football|2006\u201307]] campaign, playing a major part in the 18 game unbeaten run along with [[Dimitrios Konstantopoulos]] in goal.

(association football)|defender]] and is currently player-manager at [[Blyth Spartans A.F.C.|Blyth Spartans]]. Nelson has previously played for [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]], [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], [[Hartlepool United F.C.|Hartlepool United]], [[Bury F.C.|Bury]], [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]], [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]], [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]], [[Cambridge United F.C.|Cambridge United]], [[Barnet F.C.|Barnet]] and [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]].\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Early career===\nBorn in [[Gateshead]], [[Tyne and Wear]], Nelson started his playing career as a semi-professional, playing for [[non-League football|non-League]] teams such as [[Spennymoor United F.C.|Spennymoor United]], [[Leek Town F.C.|Leek Town]] and [[Bishop Auckland F.C.|Bishop Auckland]]. Nelson's performances attracted the attention of league clubs who sent scouts to watch him. Nelson was given a trial at [[Hartlepool United F.C.|Hartlepool]] but he was not offered a contract by the then Hartlepool manager [[Chris Turner (footballer b. 1958)|Chris Turner]]. However Nelson was offered a contract at [[Bury F.C.|Bury]] by manager [[Andy Preece]] after Bury scout Peter Ward convinced him to give Nelson a chance.\n\n===Bury===\nOnce Nelson had settled down to professional football, he gradually became a first team regular and during his first full season at Bury he managed to play 31 of the clubs 46 league matches, scoring 2 goals in the process. Nelson formed a defensive partnership with [[Danny Swailes]]. However, during the season Nelson suffered what he described as ''the worst injury of his career'' after suffering a collapsed lung and several cracked ribs after a collision during Bury's match against [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]]. Nelson had to have a drain inserted into his chest for several days while he was hospitalised. The injury threatened to keep him sidelined for three months but remarkably Nelson was able to resume training less than three weeks later.\n\nDespite being dropped early on, Nelson's second season turned out to be even more successful as he played in 40 of Bury's 46 matches, scoring 5 goals. Nelson was made club captain and his performances earned him the respect of the club's players and fans. During that season, Bury manager Andy Preece hailed Nelson as \"the best centre-half in Division Three\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manchesteronline.co.uk/sport/football/bury/s/58/58059_nelsons_different_class.html|title=Nelson's different class|date=8 May 2003|publisher=Manchester Evening News|accessdate=18 April 2010}}</ref> However, Bury failed to gain promotion to League 1 as they missed out during the play-offs and Nelson was offered the chance to play in a higher division by several League 1 clubs.\n\n===Hartlepool United===\nThe following season, Nelson joined Hartlepool United on the same day that [[Neale Cooper]] was appointed manager for a fee of around \u00a370,000.<ref>{{cite news|title=Nelson sails into Hartlepool|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11756/2269095/|publisher=Sky Sports|date=26 June 2003|accessdate=10 March 2013}}</ref> Nelson was seen as natural replacement for [[Graeme Lee (footballer)|Graeme Lee]] who had joined Sheffield Wednesday. Nelson started strongly for Hartlepool and scored the winner from 30 yards during his debut in Hartlepool's 4\u20133 win over [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough]]. This goal almost earned him another award as it was on the shortlist for Hartlepool's Goal of the Season. He was also voted September's Player of the Month on the official Hartlepool website. Nelson began to form a strong partnership with [[Chris Westwood]] and the pair played together for the majority of Hartlepool's games. Nelson went on to play in 40 of Hartlepool's league matches and played in both legs of Hartlepool's play-off semi-final match against [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]]. Nelson was in contention for Hartlepool's Fans and Players' Player of the season but he missed out to [[Jim Provett]] on both occasions.\n\nHowever Nelson failed to maintain this through to the 2004\u201305 season and he handed in a transfer request.<ref>{{cite news|title=Nelson asks for transfer|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11756/2314645/|publisher=Sky Sports|date=25 October 2004|accessdate=10 March 2013}}</ref> His agent claimed that he'd been \"promised\" a better deal. This triggered a feud with Hartlepool chairman [[Ken Hodcroft]] who criticised Nelson and his agent. Nelson was missing in several of Hartlepool's matches and was rumoured to be signing for [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] for a fee of around \u00a3100,000. However Nelson withdrew his transfer request and was reinstalled into the starting line-up. His performances earned him an improved contract and he was offered a new three-year contract that would tie him to the club until 2008.<ref>{{cite news|title=Nelson stays with Pools|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11756/2341528/|publisher=Sky Sports|date=9 July 2005|accessdate=10 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nNelson's third season of the club saw him receiving his first red card for Hartlepool after he retaliated and elbowed [[Jack Lester]] during Hartlepool's defeat to Nottingham Forest. He was the favoured central defender alongside [[Ben Clark (footballer born 1983)|Ben Clark]] during the [[2006\u201307 in English football|2006\u201307]] campaign, playing a major part in the 18 game unbeaten run along with [[Dimitrios Konstantopoulos]] in goal. The season also saw him take the captain's armband in the absence on [[Michael Barron]].\n\nNelson was named in the PFA [[Football League Two|League Two]] Team of the Year for the 2006\u201307 season.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/6582201.stm|title=Ronaldo secures PFA awards double |publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=18 April 2010 | date=22 April 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Norwich City===\nIn June 2009, Nelson agreed to join [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], who had just been relegated to [[Football League One|League One]], on a two-year deal once his contract at Hartlepool expired at the end of the month.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canaries.co.uk/page/NewsDetails/0,,10355~1696213,00.html|title=Nelson set to join|date=19 June 2009|publisher=Norwich City F.C|accessdate=18 April 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090627043549/http://www.canaries.co.uk/page/NewsDetails/0,,10355~1696213,00.html|archivedate=27 June 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> He made his debut in the 7\u20131 opening-day thrashing at the hands of Colchester, and did not play for the first team again until the game against his former club Hartlepool later in August, in which he scored a magnificent overhead kick.

We know from archaeology that the Monongahela had a far more vast territory at the time <ref>Bloemker, James D. \"An Overview of Historical Archaeology in West Virginia\" 1988.</ref> & the Iroquois Book of Rites shows that there were Siouans along Lake Erie's southern shores as well. The Iroquois collectively called them the Alligewi (better written Adegowe <ref>Froman, Francis & Keye, Alfred J. ''English-Cayuga/Cayuga-English Dictionary'' 2014.</ref> ), or Mound Builders. It is said that this is where the term Allegheny comes from (Adegoweni). Two groups of migrating Iroquoians moved through the region\u2014an Iroquois related group who spread west along the Great Lakes & a Tuscarora related group who followed the coast straight south. The Eries were the next to split off from the Iroquois & may have once held northwestern PA. An offshoot of them crossed the Ohio & fought back the ancient Monongahela, but later merged with the Susquahannocks to form a single, expanded territory.<ref>Hale, Horatio \"The Iroquois Book of Rites\" 1884.</ref> (Europeans later said that they used the terms White Minqua & Black Minqua to differentiate their ancestries from one another.) A whole other Iroquoian tribe, the Petun, are believed to be Huron related and entered the region after, wedging in between the Eries & Iroquois.\n\nBy the time that [[European colonization of the Americas]] began, several [[Native American tribes]] inhabited the region.<ref name=PHMC1/> The [[Lenape]] spoke an [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian language]], and inhabited an area known as the [[Lenapehoking]], which was mostly made up of the state of New Jersey, but incorporated a lot of surrounding area, including eastern Pennsylvania.

In the 17th century, the [[Dutch colonization of the Americas|Dutch]], [[Swedish colonization of the Americas|Swedish]], and [[British colonization of the Americas|British]] all competed for southeastern Pennsylvania, while the [[French colonization of the Americas|French]] expanded into parts of [[western Pennsylvania]].\n\nIn 1638, the [[Swedish Empire|Kingdom of Sweden]], then one of the [[great power]]s in Europe, established the colony of [[New Sweden]] in the area of the present-day [[Mid-Atlantic states]]. The colony was established by [[Peter Minuit]], the former governor of [[New Netherland]], who established the [[North American fur trade|fur trading colony]] over the objections of the Dutch. New Sweden extended into modern-day Pennsylvania, and was centered on the [[Delaware River]] with a capital at [[Fort Christina]] (near [[Wilmington, Delaware]]). In 1643, New Sweden Governor [[Johan Bj\u00f6rnsson Printz]] established Fort Nya Gothenburg, the first European settlement in Pennsylvania, on [[Tinicum Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Tinicum Island]]. Printz also built his own home, [[The Printzhof]], on the island.\n\nIn 1609, the [[Dutch Republic]], in the midst of the [[Dutch Golden Age]], commissioned [[Henry Hudson]] to explore North America. Shortly thereafter, the Dutch established the colony of [[New Netherland]] to profit from the [[North American fur trade]]. In 1655, during the [[Second Northern War]], the Dutch under [[Peter Stuyvesant]] captured the [[New Sweden]]. Although Sweden never again controlled land in the area, several Swedish and [[Finnish people|Finnish]] colonists remained, and with their influence came America's first [[log cabin]]s.\n\nThe [[Kingdom of England]] had established the [[Colony of Virginia]] in 1607 and the adjacent [[Province of Maryland|Colony of Maryland]] in 1632. England also claimed the [[Delaware River]] watershed based on the explorations of [[John Cabot]], [[John Smith of Jamestown|John Smith]], and [[Francis Drake]]. The English named the Delaware River for [[Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr]], the Governor of [[Virginia]] from 1610 until 1618. During the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] (1665\u20131667), the English took control of the Dutch (and former Swedish) holdings in North America. At the end of the [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]], the 1674 [[Treaty of Westminster (1674)|Treaty of Westminster]] permanently confirmed England's control of the region.\n\nFollowing the voyages of [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] and [[Jacques Cartier]], the French established a permanent colony in [[New France]] in the 17th century to exploit the [[North American fur trade]]. During the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries, the French expanded New France across present day [[Eastern Canada]] into the [[Great Lakes region]], and colonized the areas around the [[Mississippi River]] as well. New France expanded into [[western Pennsylvania]] by the 18th century, as the French built [[Fort Duquesne]] to defend the [[Ohio River]] valley. With the end of the Swedish and Dutch colonies, the French were the last rivals to the British for control of the region that would become Pennsylvania. France was often [[Pacte de Famille|allied]] with [[Spain]], the only other remaining European power with holdings in continental [[North America]]. Beginning in 1688 with [[King William's War]] (part of the [[Nine Years' War]]), France and England engaged in a [[French and Indian Wars|series of wars]] for dominance over [[Northern America]]. The wars continued until the end of the [[French and Indian War]] in 1763, when France lost [[New France]].\n\n==Colonial period==\n{{main|Province of Pennsylvania}}\n[[Image:William Penn.png|thumb|150px|[[William Penn]], founder of Pennsylvania.

Many of the settlers worshiped a brand of Christianity disfavored by the government of their homeland; [[Huguenots]], [[Puritans]], [[Calvinist]]s, [[Mennonites]] and [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] all migrated to Pennsylvania. Other groups, including [[Anglican]]s and [[Jew]]s, migrated to Pennsylvania, while Pennsylvania also had a significant [[African-American]] population by 1730.

In Penn's ''[[Frame of Government of Pennsylvania|Frame of Government of 1682]],'' Penn established a combined assembly by providing for equal membership from each county and requiring legislation to have the assent of both the [[Delaware|Lower Counties]] and the [[Pennsylvania|Upper Counties]]. The meeting place for the assembly alternated between Philadelphia and [[New Castle, Delaware|New Castle]]. In 1704, after disagreements between the upper and lower counties, the lower counties began meeting in a separate assembly.

Meanwhile, [[Philadelphia]] became an important port and trading center. The [[University of Pennsylvania]] was founded during this period, and [[Benjamin Franklin]] established various other organizations such as the [[American Philosophical Society]], the [[Union Fire Company]], and the [[Pennsylvania Abolition Society]].

The French would lose their North American possessions to England after the [[French and Indian War]].]]\nThe western portions of Pennsylvania were among disputed territory between the colonial British and French during the [[French and Indian War]] (the North American component of the [[Seven Years' War]]). The French had established numerous fortified sites in Pennsylvania, including [[Fort Le Boeuf]], [[Fort Presque Isle]], [[Fort Machault]], and the pivotal [[Fort Duquesne]], located near the present site of [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]]. Many Indian tribes were [[Franco-Indian alliance|allied with the French]] because of their long trading history and opposition to the expansion of the British colonies. The conflict began near the present site of [[Uniontown, Pennsylvania]] when a company of Virginia militia under the command of [[George Washington]] ambushed a French force at the [[Battle of Jumonville Glen]] in 1754. Washington retreated to [[Fort Necessity]] and surrendered to a larger French force at the [[Battle of Fort Necessity]]. In 1755, the British sent [[Braddock Expedition]] to capture Fort Duquesne, but the expedition ended in failure after the British lost the [[Battle of the Monongahela]] near present-day [[Braddock, Pennsylvania]]. In 1758, the British sent the [[Forbes Expedition]] to capture Fort Duquesne. The French won the [[Battle of Fort Duquesne]], but after the battle the outnumbered French force demolished Fort Duquesne and retreated from the area. Fighting in North America had mostly come to an end by 1760, but the war continued until the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763. [[Great Britain in the Seven Years War|Britain's victory in the war]] helped secure Pennsylvania's frontier, as the [[Ohio Country]] came under formal British control. Although [[New France]] was no more, the French would deal their British rivals a major blow in the [[American Revolution]] by [[Franco-American alliance|aiding]] the rebel cause.\n\nDuring the [[French and Indian War]], Pennsylvania settlers experienced raids from Indian allies of the French. The settlers' pleas for military relief were stymied by a power struggle in Philadelphia between Governor [[Robert Hunter Morris|Robert Morris]] and the Pennsylvania Assembly. Morris wanted to send military forces to the frontier, but the Assembly, whose leadership included [[Benjamin Franklin]], refused to grant the funds unless Morris agreed to the taxation of the proprietary lands, the vast tracts still owned by the Penn family and others. The dispute was finally settled, and military relief sent, when the owners of the proprietary lands sent 5,000 pounds to the colonial government, on condition that it was considered a free gift and not a down payment on taxes.<ref>Parkman, Francis.

Delegates met in June in Philadelphia, where events (the signing of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]) soon overtook assemblymen's efforts to control the delegates and the outcome of their discussions. On July 8 attendees elected delegates to write a [[Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776|state constitution]].

But the new constitution lacked a governor or upper legislative house to provide checks against popular movements. It also required test oaths, which kept the opposition from taking office. The constitution called for a unicameral legislature or Assembly. Executive authority rested in a ''[[Supreme Executive Council of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania|Supreme Executive Council]]'' whose members were to be appointed by the assembly. In elections during 1776, radicals gained control of the Assembly. By early 1777, they selected an executive council, and [[Thomas Wharton, Jr.]] was named as the President of the Council. This constitution was never formally adopted, so government was on an ad-hoc basis until a new constitution could be written fourteen years later.\n[[Image:BenFranklinDuplessis.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Benjamin Franklin]], a [[polymath]] and one of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]]]]\n\nIn 1780, Pennsylvania passed a [[An Act for the Gradual Abolition of Slavery|law]] that provided for the gradual [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition of slavery]], making Pennsylvania the first state to pass an act to abolish slavery (although [[Vermont Republic|Vermont]] had also previously abolished slavery).<ref>{{cite web|title=Constitution of Vermont (1777)|url=https://www.sec.state.vt.us/archives-records/state-archives/government-history/vermont-constitutions/1777-constitution.aspx#ChapterI|publisher=State of Vermont|accessdate=June 7, 2014|location=Chapter I, Article I|year=1777}}</ref> Children born after that date to slave mothers were considered legally free, but they were bound in [[indentured servitude]] to the master of their mother until the age of 28.

The [[Mason\u2013Dixon line]] established the borders between Pennsylvania and [[Maryland]], and was later extended to serve as the border between Pennsylvania and [[Virginia]] (except for what is now [[Northern Panhandle of West Virginia|West Virginia's northern panhandle]]). Although some settlers proposed the creation of the state of [[Westsylvania]] in the area that now contains [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania retained control of the region. The first [[Treaty of Fort Stanwix]] and the Treaty of [[Fort McIntosh (Pennsylvania)|Fort McIntosh]]<ref name=DDP/> saw Native Americans relinquish claims on present-day [[southwestern Pennsylvania]]. The [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]] granted the United States independence, and also saw Great Britain give up its land claims in the neighboring [[Ohio Country]], although most of these lands ultimately became new states under the terms of the [[Northwest Ordinance of 1787]]. In the [[Treaty of Fort Stanwix (1784)|second Treaty of Fort Stanwix]], Pennsylvania gained control of northwestern Pennsylvania from the [[Iroquois League]]. The [[New York\u2013Pennsylvania border]] was established in 1787. Pennsylvania purchased the [[Erie Triangle]] from the federal government in 1792. In 1799, the [[Pennamite\u2013Yankee War]] came to an end, as Pennsylvania kept control of the [[Wyoming Valley]] despite the presence of settlers from [[Connecticut]].\n[[Image:Penncolony.png|thumb|left|250px|Pennsylvania and the competing land claims of other states]]\nAfter the United States government granted land to Revolutionary War soldiers for military service, the [[Pennsylvania General Assembly]] passed a general land act on April 3, 1792. It authorized the sale and distribution of the large remaining tracts of land east and west of the [[Allegheny River]] in hopes of sparking development of the vast territory. The process was an uneven affair, prompting much speculation but little settlement. Most veteran soldiers sold their shares sight unseen under market value, and many investors were ultimately ruined. The East Allegheny district consisted of lands in [[Potter County, Pennsylvania|Potter]], [[McKean County, Pennsylvania|McKean]], [[Cameron County, Pennsylvania|Cameron]], [[Elk County, Pennsylvania|Elk]], and [[Jefferson County, Pennsylvania|Jefferson]] counties, at the time worthless tracts. West Allegheny district was made up of lands in [[Erie County, Pennsylvania|Erie]], [[Crawford County, Pennsylvania|Crawford]], [[Warren County, Pennsylvania|Warren]], and [[Venango County, Pennsylvania|Venango]] counties, relatively good investments at the time.\n\nThree major land companies participated in the land speculation that followed.

The area was home to the [[Lenape]], [[Susquehannock]], [[Iroquois]], [[Erie (tribe)|Erie]], [[Shawnee]], Arandiqiouia, and other [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] tribes. Most of these tribes were driven off or reduced to remnants as a result of diseases, such as smallpox, that swept through long before any permanent colonists arrived.\n\nPennsylvania was colonized by Swedish and Dutch settlers in the 17th century, before the English took control of the colony in 1667. In 1681, [[William Penn]] established a colony based on religious tolerance; it was settled by many [[Quakers]] along with its chief city Philadelphia, which was also the first planned city. In the mid-eighteenth century, the colony attracted many German and [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] immigrants.\n\nPennsylvania played a central role in the [[American Revolution]], and [[Philadelphia]] served as the nation's capital for a portion of the 18th century. It was the second most populous state in the country from the 18th century into the 20th century, and Philadelphia was the second most populous city in the nation. Pennsylvania also expanded its borders into northwestern, northeastern, and southwestern Pennsylvania, and [[Pittsburgh]] grew into one of America's largest and most prominent cities. The state played an important role in the Union's victory in the [[American Civil War]]. After the war, Pennsylvania grew into a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] stronghold and a major manufacturing and transportation center. After the [[Great Depression]] and [[World War II]], Pennsylvania moved towards the [[Tertiary sector of the economy|service industry]] and became a [[swing state]].\n\n==Pre-Columbian era==\n[[ Image:Lapowinsa01.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lappawinsoe]] of the [[Lenape]], painted by [[Gustavus Hesselius]] in 1735.

In the 17th century, the [[Dutch colonization of the Americas|Dutch]], [[Swedish colonization of the Americas|Swedish]], and [[British colonization of the Americas|British]] all competed for southeastern Pennsylvania, while the [[French colonization of the Americas|French]] expanded into parts of [[western Pennsylvania]].\n\nIn 1638, the [[Swedish Empire|Kingdom of Sweden]], then one of the [[great power]]s in Europe, established the colony of [[New Sweden]] in the area of the present-day [[Mid-Atlantic states]]. The colony was established by [[Peter Minuit]], the former governor of [[New Netherland]], who established the [[North American fur trade|fur trading colony]] over the objections of the Dutch. New Sweden extended into modern-day Pennsylvania, and was centered on the [[Delaware River]] with a capital at [[Fort Christina]] (near [[Wilmington, Delaware]]). In 1643, New Sweden Governor [[Johan Bj\u00f6rnsson Printz]] established Fort Nya Gothenburg, the first European settlement in Pennsylvania, on [[Tinicum Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Tinicum Island]]. Printz also built his own home, [[The Printzhof]], on the island.\n\nIn 1609, the [[Dutch Republic]], in the midst of the [[Dutch Golden Age]], commissioned [[Henry Hudson]] to explore North America. Shortly thereafter, the Dutch established the colony of [[New Netherland]] to profit from the [[North American fur trade]]. In 1655, during the [[Second Northern War]], the Dutch under [[Peter Stuyvesant]] captured the [[New Sweden]]. Although Sweden never again controlled land in the area, several Swedish and [[Finnish people|Finnish]] colonists remained, and with their influence came America's first [[log cabin]]s.\n\nThe [[Kingdom of England]] had established the [[Colony of Virginia]] in 1607 and the adjacent [[Province of Maryland|Colony of Maryland]] in 1632. England also claimed the [[Delaware River]] watershed based on the explorations of [[John Cabot]], [[John Smith of Jamestown|John Smith]], and [[Francis Drake]]. The English named the Delaware River for [[Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr]], the Governor of [[Virginia]] from 1610 until 1618. During the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] (1665\u20131667), the English took control of the Dutch (and former Swedish) holdings in North America. At the end of the [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]], the 1674 [[Treaty of Westminster (1674)|Treaty of Westminster]] permanently confirmed England's control of the region.\n\nFollowing the voyages of [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] and [[Jacques Cartier]], the French established a permanent colony in [[New France]] in the 17th century to exploit the [[North American fur trade]]. During the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries, the French expanded New France across present day [[Eastern Canada]] into the [[Great Lakes region]], and colonized the areas around the [[Mississippi River]] as well. New France expanded into [[western Pennsylvania]] by the 18th century, as the French built [[Fort Duquesne]] to defend the [[Ohio River]] valley. With the end of the Swedish and Dutch colonies, the French were the last rivals to the British for control of the region that would become Pennsylvania. France was often [[Pacte de Famille|allied]] with [[Spain]], the only other remaining European power with holdings in continental [[North America]]. Beginning in 1688 with [[King William's War]] (part of the [[Nine Years' War]]), France and England engaged in a [[French and Indian Wars|series of wars]] for dominance over [[Northern America]].

In Penn's ''[[Frame of Government of Pennsylvania|Frame of Government of 1682]],'' Penn established a combined assembly by providing for equal membership from each county and requiring legislation to have the assent of both the [[Delaware|Lower Counties]] and the [[Pennsylvania|Upper Counties]]. The meeting place for the assembly alternated between Philadelphia and [[New Castle, Delaware|New Castle]]. In 1704, after disagreements between the upper and lower counties, the lower counties began meeting in a separate assembly.

The French would lose their North American possessions to England after the [[French and Indian War]].]]\nThe western portions of Pennsylvania were among disputed territory between the colonial British and French during the [[French and Indian War]] (the North American component of the [[Seven Years' War]]). The French had established numerous fortified sites in Pennsylvania, including [[Fort Le Boeuf]], [[Fort Presque Isle]], [[Fort Machault]], and the pivotal [[Fort Duquesne]], located near the present site of [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]]. Many Indian tribes were [[Franco-Indian alliance|allied with the French]] because of their long trading history and opposition to the expansion of the British colonies. The conflict began near the present site of [[Uniontown, Pennsylvania]] when a company of Virginia militia under the command of [[George Washington]] ambushed a French force at the [[Battle of Jumonville Glen]] in 1754. Washington retreated to [[Fort Necessity]] and surrendered to a larger French force at the [[Battle of Fort Necessity]]. In 1755, the British sent [[Braddock Expedition]] to capture Fort Duquesne, but the expedition ended in failure after the British lost the [[Battle of the Monongahela]] near present-day [[Braddock, Pennsylvania]]. In 1758, the British sent the [[Forbes Expedition]] to capture Fort Duquesne. The French won the [[Battle of Fort Duquesne]], but after the battle the outnumbered French force demolished Fort Duquesne and retreated from the area. Fighting in North America had mostly come to an end by 1760, but the war continued until the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763. [[Great Britain in the Seven Years War|Britain's victory in the war]] helped secure Pennsylvania's frontier, as the [[Ohio Country]] came under formal British control. Although [[New France]] was no more, the French would deal their British rivals a major blow in the [[American Revolution]] by [[Franco-American alliance|aiding]] the rebel cause.\n\nDuring the [[French and Indian War]], Pennsylvania settlers experienced raids from Indian allies of the French. The settlers' pleas for military relief were stymied by a power struggle in Philadelphia between Governor [[Robert Hunter Morris|Robert Morris]] and the Pennsylvania Assembly. Morris wanted to send military forces to the frontier, but the Assembly, whose leadership included [[Benjamin Franklin]], refused to grant the funds unless Morris agreed to the taxation of the proprietary lands, the vast tracts still owned by the Penn family and others. The dispute was finally settled, and military relief sent, when the owners of the proprietary lands sent 5,000 pounds to the colonial government, on condition that it was considered a free gift and not a down payment on taxes.<ref>Parkman, Francis.

But the new constitution lacked a governor or upper legislative house to provide checks against popular movements. It also required test oaths, which kept the opposition from taking office. The constitution called for a unicameral legislature or Assembly. Executive authority rested in a ''[[Supreme Executive Council of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania|Supreme Executive Council]]'' whose members were to be appointed by the assembly. In elections during 1776, radicals gained control of the Assembly. By early 1777, they selected an executive council, and [[Thomas Wharton, Jr.]] was named as the President of the Council.

Although some settlers proposed the creation of the state of [[Westsylvania]] in the area that now contains [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania retained control of the region. The first [[Treaty of Fort Stanwix]] and the Treaty of [[Fort McIntosh (Pennsylvania)|Fort McIntosh]]<ref name=DDP/> saw Native Americans relinquish claims on present-day [[southwestern Pennsylvania]]. The [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]] granted the United States independence, and also saw Great Britain give up its land claims in the neighboring [[Ohio Country]], although most of these lands ultimately became new states under the terms of the [[Northwest Ordinance of 1787]]. In the [[Treaty of Fort Stanwix (1784)|second Treaty of Fort Stanwix]], Pennsylvania gained control of northwestern Pennsylvania from the [[Iroquois League]]. The [[New York\u2013Pennsylvania border]] was established in 1787. Pennsylvania purchased the [[Erie Triangle]] from the federal government in 1792. In 1799, the [[Pennamite\u2013Yankee War]] came to an end, as Pennsylvania kept control of the [[Wyoming Valley]] despite the presence of settlers from [[Connecticut]].\n[[Image:Penncolony.png|thumb|left|250px|Pennsylvania and the competing land claims of other states]]\nAfter the United States government granted land to Revolutionary War soldiers for military service, the [[Pennsylvania General Assembly]] passed a general land act on April 3, 1792. It authorized the sale and distribution of the large remaining tracts of land east and west of the [[Allegheny River]] in hopes of sparking development of the vast territory. The process was an uneven affair, prompting much speculation but little settlement. Most veteran soldiers sold their shares sight unseen under market value, and many investors were ultimately ruined.

It is the seat of the [[List of bishops of Lund|Bishop of Lund]] and the main church of the [[Diocese of Lund]]. It was built as the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] cathedral of the [[archiepiscopal see]] of all the [[Nordic countries]], dedicated to [[Lawrence of Rome|Saint Lawrence]]. It is one of the oldest stone buildings still in use in Sweden.\n\nLund Cathedral has been called \"the most powerful representative of [[Romanesque architecture]] in the Nordic countries\". Its main altar was consecrated in 1145 and the cathedral was by that time largely finished; the western towers were built somewhat later. Its architecture show clear influences from contemporary north Italian architecture, conveyed via the [[Rhine Valley]]. The earliest architect was named Donatus, though his precise role in the construction of the cathedral is difficult to determine. The new cathedral was richly decorated with stone sculpture, including two unusual statues in the crypt traditionally called \"The giant Finn and his wife\" about which a local legend has developed. The cathedral was severely damaged in a fire in 1234, and major restoration works were carried out in the early 16th century under the leadership of [[Adam van D\u00fcren]]. Following the [[Reformation in Denmark\u2013Norway and Holstein|Reformation]], the cathedral suffered from lost income and dilapidation. In 1658, the city of Lund and the cathedral became a part of Sweden following the [[Treaty of Roskilde]]. Lund Cathedral was the site of the ceremony founding [[Lund University]] in 1688. Repairs were made during the 18th century but in 1832 a complete restoration of the cathedral was recommended. Subsequently much of the cathedral was restored and rebuilt during most of the 19th century. The work was first led by [[Carl Georg Brunius]] and later by architect [[Helgo Zettervall]] and not entirely finished until 1893. The changes done during the 19th century went very far; among other things, Zettervall had the entire western part, including the towers, demolished and rebuilt to his own designs.\n\nThe medieval cathedral contains several historic furnishings and pieces of art. Its main altarpiece was donated to the cathedral in 1398, and it also contains [[Gothic art|Gothic]] choir stalls, bronzes and an [[astronomical clock]] from the 15th century (although heavily restored in 1923). When it was built, Lund Cathedral was lavishly decorated with Romanesque stone sculptures. It also contains late medieval stone sculptures from the time of Adam van D\u00fcren's renovation. After the Reformation the cathedral was also equipped with a decorated [[pulpit]]. Of more recent date is the large [[mosaic]] in the [[apse]], by [[Joakim Skovgaard]], installed in 1927. Lund Cathedral has six [[church organ]]s, one of which is the largest in Sweden, and is also used as a concert venue.\n\n==Historical background==\nChristian missionaries from present-day Germany and England were active in the [[Christianization of Scandinavia|Christianisation of Denmark]], and Denmark eventually became part of the [[Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen|Archdiocese of Hamburg-Bremen]]. With the consolidation of Danish monarchy during the second half of the 11th century, and with a political crisis in continental Europe, there arose an opportunity for the Danish monarchs to bypass the German influence over church policy in Denmark.{{sfn|Ryd\u00e9n|1999|p=99\u2013100}} An [[episcopal see]] was created in Lund in 1060.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=25}} At the same time, another see was created in [[Dalby, Lund Municipality|Dalby]], very close to Lund. However, when the first bishop of Lund ([[Henry of Lund]]) died, the erstwhile bishop of Dalby, [[Egino (Bishop of Dalby)|Egino]], was installed in Lund and Dalby abandoned as the seat of a bishop. At the same time, in 1103, Lund was proclaimed an archiepiscopal see covering all Nordic countries.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=25\u201329}}{{sfn|Wrangel|1923|p=4\u20135}}\n\nSome kind of rudimentary settlement probably existed at the site of Lund Cathedral at the end of the 10th and early 11th centuries, but no remains of buildings have been found there.{{sfn|Cinthio|1990|p=1}} Lund Cathedral is one of the oldest stone buildings still in use in Sweden.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=7}} During the [[Middle Ages]], the cathedral was surrounded by several buildings serving the diocese, of which only [[Liberiet]], which at one point served as a library, survives.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=69\u201371}}\n\n==History==\n===Foundation and construction===\n[[File:Lund domkyrka - crypt (by Pudelek).JPG|thumb|right|The crypt, the oldest part of Lund Cathedral]]\n[[File:Lund Dom Chor.JPG|thumb|right|The [[apse]] is the most well-preserved part of the original exterior]]\nThe earliest written mention of a church in Lund dedicated to [[Saint Lawrence]] \u2014 the patron saint of Lund Cathedral during the Middle Ages \u2014 dates from 1085.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=37}} Slightly later sources mention both a new and an old church dedicated to Saint Lawrence.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=38}} During the 1940s, archaeological excavations in the cathedral uncovered the foundations of another church inside the present building. The exact age, shape and function of this predecessor to the cathedral has been a matter of some debate.{{sfn|Cinthio|1957|p=1\u201342}}{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=62\u201364}} Most scholars believe that construction of a church on the site of Lund Cathedral was begun sometime during the second half of the 11th century.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=11}} Some time thereafter a new church was begun in almost the same place, but to a larger design in the form of the present cathedral. Parts of the earlier church may have been incorporated in the walls of the cathedral.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=11}} The decision to abandon Dalby as a bishopric and make Lund the sole archbishopric in Scandinavia may have promted the change of plans.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=40}}\n\nApart from the obscurity which thus surrounds the very beginning of the history of the cathedral, the construction of Lund Cathedral is probably among the most well documented among any [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque churches]].{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=28}} Two contemporary accounts of the building of the cathedral, in the form of the [[illuminated manuscripts]] ''{{ill|Necrologium Lundense|sv}}'' and ''{{ill|Liber daticus vetustior|sv}}'', are still preserved in the library of [[Lund University]]. Both books contain notes, written in [[Latin language|Latin]], with dates on the progression of the construction. The oldest part of the cathedral is the large [[crypt]]. Its main [[altar]] was inaugurated on 30 June 1123, followed by the north (1126) and south (1131) side altars in the crypt. Only then did the cathedral begin the be used.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=28}} One of the main functions of the crypt appears to have been as a place where [[baptism]]s were conducted.{{sfn|Wrangel|1915|p=4}} The main altar of the cathedral was dedicated to [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Saint Mary]] and Saint Lawrence in 1145, by the second archbishop of Lund, [[Eskil of Lund|Eskil]], in a ceremony attended by bishops from present-day Germany, Denmark and Sweden.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=29\u201330}} By then, the construction of the cathedral to more or less its present dimensions was complete.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=30}}{{sfn|Wahl\u00f6\u00f6|2004|p=186\u2013187}}\n\nUnusually for that time, the architect of the cathedral is known by his name, Donatus.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=11}}{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=30}}{{sfn|Wrangel|1923|p=164}} The name appears in both the ''Necrologium Lundense'' (as \"Donatus architectus\") and the ''Liber daticus vetustior''. Donatus may have been responsible for the layout of the crypt and the cathedral above ground as far west as the current north and south portals of the cathedral, although it is difficult to draw any definitive conclusions about his precise role.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=30}}{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=64}} The same is true for his successor, possibly a builder named Ragnar.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=32}} The building erected during the time of Donatus and his successor show clear influences from Romanesque architecture in [[Lombardy]], conveyed via the [[Rhine Valley]].{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=66}} Donatus himself appears to have been from, or at least educated in, Lombardy.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=58}} [[Speyer Cathedral]] in western Germany is stylistically closely related to Lund Cathedral (especially the crypt), and it has been proposed that Donatus came to Lund from Speyer, where construction more or less ceased in 1106 following the death of [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry IV]].{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=59}}{{sfn|Wrangel|1923|p=148}} Similarities have also frequently been pointed out between Lund Cathedral and [[Mainz Cathedral]], and the design of the apse is similar to that of the [[Basilica of Saint Servatius]] in [[Maastricht]].{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=68}} On a more general level, the origins of the style of Lund Cathedral can be found in [[Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio]] ([[Milan]]), [[Modena Cathedral]] and several churches in [[Pavia]], all in northern Italy.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=62}} Similar stylistic influences can be seen in other cathedrals in Denmark from the same time, e.g. in [[Ribe Cathedral]].{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=64}}\n\nThe building of Lund Cathedral must have involved a large number of people and was a collective undertaking.{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=68}} Comparable but somewhat later workshops at [[Cologne Cathedral]] and [[Uppsala Cathedral]] employed a workforce of about 100 and 60 people, respectively.{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=68}} The project was instrumental in establishing a workshop where local craftsmen could be educated, and thus disseminating artistic influences from continental Europe in Scandinavia. The stone sculptors {{ill|Carl stenm\u00e4stare|sv}}, {{ill|M\u00e5rten stenm\u00e4stare|sv}} and [[Majestatis]] were probably all Scandinavians who were educated at the construction site.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=62}} Many early Romanesque stone churches in the countryside, particularly in Scania but also in the rest of Sweden, show direct influences from Lund Cathedral, notably {{ill|V\u00e4 Church|sv|V\u00e4 kyrka}} (Scania).{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=79\u201381}}{{sfn|Wrangel|1915|p=265\u2013281}} Other examples are e.g. {{ill|Lannaskede Old Church|sv|Lannaskede gamla kyrka}} ([[Sm\u00e5land]]), {{ill|Hogstad Church|sv|Hogstads kyrka}} ([[\u00d6sterg\u00f6tland]]) and [[Havdhem Church]] ([[Gotland]]).{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=90\u201392}}\n\n===Fire and repairs===\nThe plan and layout of the building consecrated in 1145 was by and large similar to the one see today. A noticeable difference was that the entire choir was separated from the nave by a wall and reserved for the clergy. The towers were also not built until a few decades later.{{sfn|Wahl\u00f6\u00f6|2014|p=187}}{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=52}} The intention was probably to provide the cathedral with [[vault (architecture)|vaults]], but instead a flat wooden ceiling was installed.{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=68\u201369}} The cathedral was adorned with [[Church murals in Sweden|wall paintings]] and almost certainly by [[Medieval stained glass in Sweden|stained glass windows]], but none of these remain.{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=66}} In 1234, the cathedral was heavily damaged by a large fire.{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=78}} Large donations were made to the church in the following years, to allow for repairs.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=74}} Even so, the need for  repairs was continuous for the entire 13th century.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=80}} Following the fire, the burnt-out ceiling was replaced by [[brick]] vaults.{{sfn|Wahl\u00f6\u00f6|2014|p=187}} Changes were also made to the layout of the westernmost part of the building.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=76}} A conflict erupted between King [[Christopher I of Denmark]] and Archbishop [[Jakob Erlandsen]] in 1257 partially because the choir had been enlarged and the seats of the royal family moved, itself a testimony of the growing power of the Church.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=76\u201378}} Two [[chapel]]s were added to the cathedral during the 14th and 15th centuries; one located adjacent to the two westernmost [[Bay (architecture)|bays]] of the south aisle of the nave, and the other as a southern extension of the east transept.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=80\u201381}} [[Buttress]]es were also added piecemeal to the building during the 13th and 14th centuries, to stabilise the building which was under strain from the new, heavier vaults, the added chapels and the constant ringing of the 8.5 [[tonne]] [[church bell]].{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=86\u201387}}\n\n===Changes by Adam van D\u00fcren and later===\n[[File:Lunds domkyrka - KMB - 16001000533737.jpg|thumb|right|A drawing of the cathedral as it appeared in 1750]]\nThe German sculptor and builder [[Adam van D\u00fcren]] apparently worked intermittently at restoring and altering the cathedral between {{circa}} 1506 or 1507 and 1524.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=90\u201391}} Despite, and to some extent because of, the work that had been done during the preceding centuries since the great fire of 1234, the cathedral was in need of a thorough restoration.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=87}} Adam van D\u00fcren and his workshop made several changes and contributions. A new drainage system was installed in the crypt, and as part of that work a [[well]], which probably replaced an earlier well in the same location, was decorated with [[satire|satirical]] [[allegory|allegories]].{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=12}}{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=88\u201395}} The workshop of van D\u00fcren also created two new windows in the choir, built a large buttress to support the southern transept (before 1513), and rebuilt the [[gable]] of the northern transept (1524) as well as its vaults. New and considerably larger windows with [[Pointed arch (architecture)|pointed arches]] were installed in both the northern wall of the north transept and in the southern wall of the south transept.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=12}}{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=100}} The towers and western facade were also repaired in 1512\u201318 and again in 1527.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=91}} It has been argued that the cathedral may have collapsed, were it not for the work done by van D\u00fcren.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=104}}\n\nFollowing the Reformation in the 16th century, the diocese lost much of its revenues.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=126}} The building was still subjected to much stress, not least by the use of the large church bell, and suffered during the recurrent [[List of wars involving Denmark|wars between Denmark and Sweden]]; in 1658 Lund permanently became part of Sweden. Despite van D\u00fcren's repairs, the church was described as being \"very dilapidated\" in 1682.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=128}} During the 18th century, the chapels of the church were used for funerals, but also as an improvised [[morgue]] where corpses were occasionally left for several years.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=130}} Attempts at repairs were made; among them the entire apse was dismantled and then re-erected.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=12}} Many of the repairs were however either temporary or outright detrimental to condition of the building. King [[Gustav III of Sweden]] visited the cathedral crypt in 1785 and expressed his displeasure at its state.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=13}}{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=132}} In 1812, the aforementioned chapels from the 14th and 15th centuries were demolished.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=134}}\n\n===Changes by Carl Georg Brunius and Helgo Zettervall===\n[[File:Demolition of the tower of Lund Cathedral.jpg|thumb|right|Demolition of the south tower of the cathedral during the time of Zettervall]]\nWhen the congregation wanted to build a new [[church organ]] in the early 19th century, architect {{ill|Axel Nystr\u00f6m|sv|Axel Nystr\u00f6m (1793\u20131868)}} was invited to examine the situation in 1832. Nystr\u00f6m recommended a complete renovation of the cathedral.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=134}} The chairman of the council in charge of administering the cathedral buildings, [[Carl Georg Brunius]], was called to execute the plans of Nystr\u00f6m, and he did so while also making changes according to his own convictions. He also wrote the first systematic art history of the cathedral.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=135}} Brunius had the organ moved, the crypt repaired, installed a set of steps connecting the choir with the nave and improved the drainage system.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=135}} He also removed modern furnishings, re-built some of the buttresses and changed the stone of a large part of the facade.{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=121}} Brunius retired due to old age in 1859, but as there was still a substantial need for repairs, the young architect [[Helgo Zettervall]] appointed to carry out the rest of the work in 1860.{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=121\u2013122}} A conflict between Brunius and Zettervall developed almost immediately, but Zettervall would keep working on restoring the cathedral until 1893 and ultimately got his will through, for the most part.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=135}}{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=121\u2013181}} A compromise in 1862 proposed that the Danish architect [[Ferdinand Meldahl]] would assume the main responsibility, and Zettervall would merely assist Meldahl. However, it soon became apparent that Zettervall would not accept a subordinate role and Meldahl himself showed little interest in the project.{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=141}} In 1862 Zettervall traveled extensively through Germany and Italy to study stylistically related architecture, and also to visit the latest examples of building restoration so that he could draw upon that experience in his work at Lund.{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=134\u2013141}} In 1863, he presented a first proposal for a complete restoration of the cathedral. Zettervall himself considered it a \"reasonable middle ground between reparation and reconstruction\".{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=142}} The proposal would mean the removal of all buttresses, a new roof, completely rebuilt towers, and the removal of the large Gothic windows in the transepts. Zettervall also proposed to add an octagonal dome over the [[Crossing (architecture)|crossing]]. Far-reaching changes would also affect the interior. In the proposal Zettervall strove to reduce and refine the building volumes of the cathedral and create a unified composition of block-like elements.{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=142\u2212152}}\n\nThe proposal by Zettervall was criticised, not least by Meldahl. Zettervall re-worked the proposal and put forward a revised, less far-reaching proposal in 1864, notably without the central dome.{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=152}} This proposal was also rejected and the plan for a complete overhaul abandoned; however it was at the same time decided that Zettervall would continue working on repairing the cathedral and every year make what changes that were deemed necessary. In this way, Zettervall could piecemeal over the next decades in effect rebuild the cathedral largely in line with the proposal from 1864.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=135}}{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=158\u2013159}}\n\nThe cathedral was radically transformed by the work of Brunius and Zettervall. All windows were replaced, several vaults and pillars were repaired or rebuilt, and both architects effected extensive changes to the transept. Just as he had suggested, Zettervall had all the buttresses removed and demolished the entire western part of the church, including the towers, and rebuilt them according to his own [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Neo-Romanesque]] designs.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=13\u201314}}<ref name=byggnaden>{{cite web |url= https://lundsdomkyrka.se/rundtur/byggnaden/|title= En kyrka i st\u00e4ndig f\u00f6r\u00e4ndring|trans-title= A constantly changing church|author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= Lund Cathedral (official site)|publisher= Church of Sweden|access-date= 19 April 2020|quote=}}</ref>\n\nIn the 20th century, archaeological excavations were carried out in and around the cathedral.

Behind them a [[nave]] with two [[aisle]] opens up to a [[transept]] that is somewhat higher than the nave. A short flight of stairs thus connect the nave with the [[choir (architecture)|choir]] as well as with the crypt under the choir. The choir ends in an apse. Inside, the bays of the cathedral are supported by [[groin vault]]s. The number of bays in the aisles are the double of that in the nave. The arches that separate the nave from the aisles are supported by piers and pillars of alternating width.

They are among the largest wooden Gothic sculptures to survive in the Nordic countries, and have been described as being of internationally high quality.{{sfn|Wrangel|1915|p=24\u201332}} The choir stalls in Lund Cathedral also lent stylistic inspiration to the choir stalls in [[Roskilde Cathedral]] and [[St. Bendt's Church, Ringsted]].{{sfn|Wrangel|1915|p=24\u201332}}{{sfn|Dun\u00e9r|1984|p=1\u20139}}\n\nSlightly older than the choir stalls is a [[Cathedra|bishop's throne]] which survives in a damaged state and is placed in the south transept. It is somewhat similar in construction to the choir stalls but stylistically different and more closely related to contemporary art from north Germany.{{sfn|Wrangel|1915|p=32\u201335}} Currently placed next to the bishop's chair is also a Gothic [[Church tabernacle|tabernacle]] in the form of a {{convert|5|m|ft}} tall, decorated wooden pillar. It contains two cabinets surmounted by a statuette of a female saint and crowned by a hexagonal spire. The tabernacle was repaired by Brunius in the 19th century. The saint may possibly be {{ill|Ida von Toggenburg|de}}.{{sfn|Wrangel|1915|p=36\u201337}}\n\n===Astronomical clock===\n{{Main|Horologium mirabile Lundense}}\n[[File:Lunds astronomiska ur-2.jpg|thumb|right|The astronomical clock]]\nThe [[astronomical clock]] of Lund Cathedral, presently located at the west end of the north aisle, dates from the late Middle Ages and was installed in Lund Cathedral {{circa}} 1425. In 1837 it was dismantled. It was restored at the initiative of architect {{ill|Theodor W\u00e5hlin|sv}} and the Danish clock-maker Julius Bertram Larsen and re-inaugurated in 1923. The upper part, which is original, is the clock, while the lower part, a reconstruction, is a calendar. Twice every day the two knights on the top clash their swords. The clock then plays the tune ''[[In dulci jubilo]]'' and a procession of figures parades across the face of the clock.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=125\u2013126}} Three astronomical clocks of similar design are preserved in Europe.

Two of the bronze columns are crowned by angels, and the third one by a statuette of Saint Lawrence, holding a gridiron, the symbol of his martyrdom. It probably dates from the middle of the 14th century, while the two angel-bearing columns may be somewhat later. Saint Lawrence's column is approximately {{convert|3|m|ft}} tall (and the saint {{convert|70|cm|inch}}), while the columns with angels are slightly smaller.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=114}} The three columns were probably made in [[L\u00fcbeck]] or [[Hamburg]].

The artist was [[Johannes Ganssog]] from [[Frankfurt an der Oder]] in present-day Germany. It is technically skillfully attached to one of the pillars of the nave, and it is entered through a stair cut inside the pillar. The building material is sandstone, black [[limestone]] and black and white [[marble]], and it is partially painted and [[gilding|gilded]]. Reliefs of [[alabaster]] on the side show scenes from the New Testament.{{sfn|Wrangel|1915|p=60\u201364}}{{sfn|Wahl\u00f6\u00f6|2014|p=187}}\n\n===Baptismal font===\nThe [[baptismal font]] of the cathedral is a sparsely decorated Early Gothic funt made of reddish grey limestone.{{sfn|Wahl\u00f6\u00f6|2014|p=187}}\n\n===Graves and funerary monuments===\nThe crypt contains the oldest grave in the cathedral, the grave of Hermann, [[List of the bishops of Schleswig|bishop of Schleswig]], who played an important role as an emissary of archbishop Eskil of Lund during the negotiations to establish Lund as an independent archdiocese. The simple Romanesque [[sarcophagus]] has an inscription i Latin and a depiction of the bishop, and is located in the apse of the crypt. It dates from the middle of the 12th century.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=48}}{{sfn|Wrangel|1915|p=46}} The crypt also contains the much larger grave monument of the last archbishop, {{ill|Birger Gunnersen|sv}}, which is centrally placed in the crypt. It is of a kind which is not unusual in continental Europe but very unusual in the Nordic countries: a large stone sarcophagus decorated on all sides with sculptures in high relief and with a full-scale depiction of the bishop in full dress on the lid. It was made by Adam van D\u00fcren in 1512.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=94}}{{sfn|Wrangel|1915|p=48\u201349}} The cathedral's largest grave monument is that of bishop [[Hans Brostorp]], who died in 1497 and who during his lifetime inaugurated the [[University of Copenhagen]]. The monument is made of limestone from [[Gotland]] and decorated in low relief.{{sfn|Wrangel|1915|p=47}}\n\nThe nave and the aisles contain several memorial plaques and [[epitaph]]s. Several commemorate bishops, such as {{ill|Johan Engestr\u00f6m|sv}} (1699\u20131777) and {{ill|Nils Hessl\u00e9n|sv}} (1728\u20131811), and professors at Lund University, e.g. {{ill|Eberhard Rosenblad|sv}} (1714\u20131796) and {{ill|Erasmus Sack|sv}} (1633\u20131697). The oldest epitaph of the cathedral commemorates the owner of [[Krageholm Castle]] {{ill|Lave Brahe|sv}} (1500\u20131567) and his wife [[G\u00f6rvel Fadersdotter (Sparre)]] (1509 or 1517 \u2013 1605).{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=122\u2013125}}\n\n==Flora==\n[[File:Flickr - Sigfrid Lundberg - Wall-rue, Asplenium ruta-muraria.jpg|thumb|right|Wall-rue growing on the apse]]\nSeveral surveys and descriptions of the [[flora]] of the cathedral, i.e. the plants that grow on its walls, have been made. The first to describe the flora of the cathedral was [[Daniel Rolander]], one of the [[apostles of Linnaeus]], who made a list of the [[vascular plant]]s, [[moss]]es and [[lichen]] he found growing on the building in 1771.{{sfn|Johansson|1993|p=25}} It was rediscovered in the 20th century and published in 1931. [[Elias Magnus Fries]] also made observations about the flora of the cathedral during the first half of the 19th century. More systematic surveys of the flora of the building have been published in 1922 and in 1993 (the latter only encompassing lichen).{{sfn|Johansson|1993|p=25}} Of the species observed growing on the cathedral, the minute [[fern]] [[Asplenium ruta-muraria|wall-rue]] was mentioned as early as 1756 by {{ill|Anders Tidstr\u00f6m|sv}} and is perhaps the most conspicuous member of the cathedral flora.{{sfn|Gertz|1923|p=458}} When the lichen flora was surveyed in 1993, 15 species were discovered. One of these, [[Lecanora perpruinosa]], had not been observed in the province of Scania before.{{sfn|Johansson|1993|p=26}}\n\n==Relationship with Lund University==\n[[Lund University]] was founded in a ceremony in the cathedral in 1688.<ref name=nyckeltal>{{cite web |url= https://lundsdomkyrka.se/fordjupning/nyckelartal/|title= Ett p\u00e4rlband av h\u00e4ndelser|trans-title= A string of events|author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= Lund Cathedral (official site)|publisher= Church of Sweden|access-date= 20 April 2020|quote=}}</ref> Following the Reformation, the choir of the cathedral was for a long time used as a classroom, first by [[Lund Cathedral School]] and later by the university.

It was built as the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] cathedral of the [[archiepiscopal see]] of all the [[Nordic countries]], dedicated to [[Lawrence of Rome|Saint Lawrence]]. It is one of the oldest stone buildings still in use in Sweden.\n\nLund Cathedral has been called \"the most powerful representative of [[Romanesque architecture]] in the Nordic countries\". Its main altar was consecrated in 1145 and the cathedral was by that time largely finished; the western towers were built somewhat later. Its architecture show clear influences from contemporary north Italian architecture, conveyed via the [[Rhine Valley]]. The earliest architect was named Donatus, though his precise role in the construction of the cathedral is difficult to determine. The new cathedral was richly decorated with stone sculpture, including two unusual statues in the crypt traditionally called \"The giant Finn and his wife\" about which a local legend has developed. The cathedral was severely damaged in a fire in 1234, and major restoration works were carried out in the early 16th century under the leadership of [[Adam van D\u00fcren]]. Following the [[Reformation in Denmark\u2013Norway and Holstein|Reformation]], the cathedral suffered from lost income and dilapidation. In 1658 the city of Lund and the cathedral became a part of Sweden following the [[Treaty of Roskilde]]. Lund Cathedral was the site of the ceremony founding [[Lund University]] in 1688. Repairs were made during the 18th century but in 1832 a complete restoration of the cathedral was recommended. Subsequently much of the cathedral was restored and rebuilt during most of the 19th century. The work was first led by [[Carl Georg Brunius]] and later by architect [[Helgo Zettervall]] and not entirely finished until 1893. The changes done during the 19th century went very far; among other things, Zettervall had the entire western part, including the towers, demolished and rebuilt to his own designs.\n\nThe medieval cathedral contains several historic furnishings and pieces of art. Its main altarpiece was donated to the cathedral in 1398, and it also contains [[Gothic art|Gothic]] choir stalls, bronzes and an [[astronomical clock]] from the 15th century (although heavily restored in 1923). When it was built, Lund Cathedral was lavishly decorated with Romanesque stone sculptures. It also contains late medieval stone sculptures from the time of Adam van D\u00fcren's renovation. After the Reformation the cathedral was also equipped with a decorated [[pulpit]]. Of more recent date is the large [[mosaic]] in the [[apse]], by [[Joakim Skovgaard]], installed in 1927. Lund Cathedral has six [[church organ]]s, one of which is the largest in Sweden, and is also used as a concert venue.\n\n==Historical background==\nChristian missionaries from present-day Germany and England were active in the [[Christianization of Scandinavia|Christianisation of Denmark]], and Denmark eventually became part of the [[Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen|Archdiocese of Hamburg-Bremen]]. With the consolidation of Danish monarchy during the second half of the 11th century, and with a political crisis in continental Europe, there arose an opportunity for the Danish monarchs to bypass the German influence over church policy in Denmark.{{sfn|Ryd\u00e9n|1999|p=99\u2013100}} An [[episcopal see]] was created in Lund in 1060.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=25}} At the same time, another see was created in [[Dalby, Lund Municipality|Dalby]], very close to Lund. However, when the first bishop of Lund ([[Henry of Lund]]) died, the erstwhile bishop of Dalby, [[Egino (Bishop of Dalby)|Egino]], was installed in Lund and Dalby abandoned as the seat of a bishop. At the same time, in 1103, Lund was proclaimed an archiepiscopal see covering all Nordic countries.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=25\u201329}}{{sfn|Wrangel|1923|p=4\u20135}}\n\nSome kind of rudimentary settlement probably existed at the site of Lund Cathedral at the end of the 10th and early 11th centuries, but no remains of buildings have been found there.{{sfn|Cinthio|1990|p=1}} Lund Cathedral is one of the oldest stone buildings still in use in Sweden.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=7}} During the [[Middle Ages]], the cathedral was surrounded by several buildings serving the diocese, of which only [[Liberiet]], which at one point served as a library, survives.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=69\u201371}}\n\n==History==\n===Foundation and construction===\n[[File:Lund domkyrka - crypt (by Pudelek).JPG|thumb|right|The crypt, the oldest part of Lund Cathedral]]\n[[File:Lund Dom Chor.JPG|thumb|right|The [[apse]] is the most well-preserved part of the original exterior]]\nThe earliest written mention of a church in Lund dedicated to [[Saint Lawrence]] \u2014 the patron saint of Lund Cathedral during the Middle Ages \u2014 dates from 1085.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=37}} Slightly later sources mention both a new and an old church dedicated to Saint Lawrence.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=38}} During the 1940s, archaeological excavations in the cathedral uncovered the foundations of another church inside the present building. The exact age, shape and function of this predecessor to the cathedral has been a matter of some debate.{{sfn|Cinthio|1957|p=1\u201342}}{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=62\u201364}} Most scholars believe that construction of a church on the site of Lund Cathedral was begun sometime during the second half of the 11th century.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=11}} Some time thereafter a new church was begun in almost the same place, but to a larger design in the form of the present cathedral. Parts of the earlier church may have been incorporated in the walls of the cathedral.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=11}} The decision to abandon Dalby as a bishopric and make Lund the sole archbishopric in Scandinavia may have promted the change of plans.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=40}}\n\nApart from the obscurity which thus surrounds the very beginning of the history of the cathedral, the construction of Lund Cathedral is probably among the most well documented among any [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque churches]].{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=28}} Two contemporary accounts of the building of the cathedral, in the form of the [[illuminated manuscripts]] ''{{ill|Necrologium Lundense|sv}}'' and ''{{ill|Liber daticus vetustior|sv}}'', are still preserved in the library of [[Lund University]]. Both books contain notes, written in [[Latin language|Latin]], with dates on the progression of the construction. The oldest part of the cathedral is the large [[crypt]]. Its main [[altar]] was inaugurated on 30 June 1123, followed by the north (1126) and south (1131) side altars in the crypt. Only then did the cathedral begin the be used.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=28}} One of the main functions of the crypt appears to have been as a place where [[baptism]]s were conducted.{{sfn|Wrangel|1915|p=4}} The main altar of the cathedral was dedicated to [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Saint Mary]] and Saint Lawrence in 1145, by the second archbishop of Lund, [[Eskil of Lund|Eskil]], in a ceremony attended by bishops from present-day Germany, Denmark and Sweden.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=29\u201330}} By then, the construction of the cathedral to more or less its present dimensions was complete.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=30}}{{sfn|Wahl\u00f6\u00f6|2004|p=186\u2013187}}\n\nUnusually for that time, the architect of the cathedral is known by his name, Donatus.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=11}}{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=30}}{{sfn|Wrangel|1923|p=164}} The name appears in both the ''Necrologium Lundense'' (as \"Donatus architectus\") and the ''Liber daticus vetustior''. Donatus may have been responsible for the layout of the crypt and the cathedral above ground as far west as the current north and south portals of the cathedral, although it is difficult to draw any definitive conclusions about his precise role.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=30}}{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=64}} The same is true for his successor, possibly a builder named Ragnar.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=32}} The building erected during the time of Donatus and his successor show clear influences from Romanesque architecture in [[Lombardy]], conveyed via the [[Rhine Valley]].{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=66}} Donatus himself appears to have been from, or at least educated in, Lombardy.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=58}} [[Speyer Cathedral]] in western Germany is stylistically closely related to Lund Cathedral (especially the crypt), and it has been proposed that Donatus came to Lund from Speyer, where construction more or less ceased in 1106 following the death of [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry IV]].{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=59}}{{sfn|Wrangel|1923|p=148}} Similarities have also frequently been pointed out between Lund Cathedral and [[Mainz Cathedral]], and the design of the apse is similar to that of the [[Basilica of Saint Servatius]] in [[Maastricht]].{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=68}} On a more general level, the origins of the style of Lund Cathedral can be found in [[Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio]] ([[Milan]]), [[Modena Cathedral]] and several churches in [[Pavia]], all in northern Italy.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=62}} Similar stylistic influences can be seen in other cathedrals in Denmark from the same time, e.g. in [[Ribe Cathedral]].{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=64}}\n\nThe building of Lund Cathedral must have involved a large number of people and was a collective undertaking.{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=68}} Comparable but somewhat later workshops at [[Cologne Cathedral]] and [[Uppsala Cathedral]] employed a workforce of about 100 and 60 people, respectively.{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=68}} The project was instrumental in establishing a workshop where local craftsmen could be educated, and thus disseminating artistic influences from continental Europe in Scandinavia. The stone sculptors {{ill|Carl stenm\u00e4stare|sv}}, {{ill|M\u00e5rten stenm\u00e4stare|sv}} and [[Majestatis]] were probably all Scandinavians who were educated at the construction site.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=62}} Many early Romanesque stone churches in the countryside, particularly in Scania but also in the rest of Sweden, show direct influences from Lund Cathedral, notably {{ill|V\u00e4 Church|sv|V\u00e4 kyrka}} (Scania).{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=79\u201381}}{{sfn|Wrangel|1915|p=265\u2013281}} Other examples are e.g. {{ill|Lannaskede Old Church|sv|Lannaskede gamla kyrka}} ([[Sm\u00e5land]]), {{ill|Hogstad Church|sv|Hogstads kyrka}} ([[\u00d6sterg\u00f6tland]]) and [[Havdhem Church]] ([[Gotland]]).{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=90\u201392}}\n\n===Fire and repairs===\nThe plan and layout of the building consecrated in 1145 was by and large similar to the one see today. A noticeable difference was that the entire choir was separated from the nave by a wall and reserved for the clergy. The towers were also not built until a few decades later.{{sfn|Wahl\u00f6\u00f6|2014|p=187}}{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=52}} The intention was probably to provide the cathedral with [[vault (architecture)|vaults]], but instead a flat wooden ceiling was installed.{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=68\u201369}} The cathedral was adorned with [[Church murals in Sweden|wall paintings]] and almost certainly by [[Medieval stained glass in Sweden|stained glass windows]], but none of these remain.{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=66}} In 1234, the cathedral was heavily damaged by a large fire.{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=78}} Large donations were made to the church in the following years, to allow for repairs.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=74}} Even so, the need for  repairs was continuous for the entire 13th century.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=80}} Following the fire, the burnt-out ceiling was replaced by [[brick]] vaults.{{sfn|Wahl\u00f6\u00f6|2014|p=187}} Changes were also made to the layout of the westernmost part of the building.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=76}} A conflict erupted between King [[Christopher I of Denmark]] and Archbishop [[Jakob Erlandsen]] in 1257 partially because the choir had been enlarged and the seats of the royal family moved, itself a testimony of the growing power of the Church.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=76\u201378}} Two [[chapel]]s were added to the cathedral during the 14th and 15th centuries; one located adjacent to the two westernmost [[Bay (architecture)|bays]] of the south aisle of the nave, and the other as a southern extension of the east transept.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=80\u201381}} [[Buttress]]es were also added piecemeal to the building during the 13th and 14th centuries, to stabilise the building which was under strain from the new, heavier vaults, the added chapels and the constant ringing of the 8.5 [[tonne]] [[church bell]].{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=86\u201387}}\n\n===Changes by Adam van D\u00fcren and later===\n[[File:Lunds domkyrka - KMB - 16001000533737.jpg|thumb|right|A drawing of the cathedral as it appeared in 1750]]\nThe German sculptor and builder [[Adam van D\u00fcren]] apparently worked intermittently at restoring and altering the cathedral between {{circa}} 1506 or 1507 and 1524.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=90\u201391}} Despite, and to some extent because of, the work that had been done during the preceding centuries since the great fire of 1234, the cathedral was in need of a thorough restoration.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=87}} Adam van D\u00fcren and his workshop made several changes and contributions. A new drainage system was installed in the crypt, and as part of that work a [[well]], which probably replaced an earlier well in the same location, was decorated with [[satire|satirical]] [[allegory|allegories]].{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=12}}{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=88\u201395}} The workshop of van D\u00fcren also created two new windows in the choir, built a large buttress to support the southern transept (before 1513), and rebuilt the [[gable]] of the northern transept (1524) as well as its vaults. New and considerably larger windows with [[Pointed arch (architecture)|pointed arches]] were installed in both the northern wall of the north transept and in the southern wall of the south transept.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=12}}{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=100}} The towers and western facade were also repaired in 1512\u201318 and again in 1527.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=91}} It has been argued that the cathedral may have collapsed, were it not for the work done by van D\u00fcren.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=104}}\n\nFollowing the Reformation in the 16th century, the diocese lost much of its revenues.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=126}} The building was still subjected to much stress, not least by the use of the large church bell, and suffered during the recurrent [[List of wars involving Denmark|wars between Denmark and Sweden]]; in 1658 Lund permanently became part of Sweden. Despite van D\u00fcren's repairs, the church was described as being \"very dilapidated\" in 1682.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=128}} During the 18th century, the chapels of the church were used for funerals, but also as an improvised [[morgue]] where corpses were occasionally left for several years.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=130}} Attempts at repairs were made; among them the entire apse was dismantled and then re-erected.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=12}} Many of the repairs were however either temporary or outright detrimental to condition of the building. King [[Gustav III of Sweden]] visited the cathedral crypt in 1785 and expressed his displeasure at its state.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=13}}{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=132}} In 1812, the aforementioned chapels from the 14th and 15th centuries were demolished.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=134}}\n\n===Changes by Carl Georg Brunius and Helgo Zettervall===\n[[File:Demolition of the tower of Lund Cathedral.jpg|thumb|right|Demolition of the south tower of the cathedral during the time of Zettervall]]\nWhen the congregation wanted to build a new [[church organ]] in the early 19th century, architect {{ill|Axel Nystr\u00f6m|sv|Axel Nystr\u00f6m (1793\u20131868)}} was invited to examine the situation in 1832. Nystr\u00f6m recommended a complete renovation of the cathedral.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=134}} The chairman of the council in charge of administering the cathedral buildings, [[Carl Georg Brunius]], was called to execute the plans of Nystr\u00f6m, and he did so while also making changes according to his own convictions. He also wrote the first systematic art history of the cathedral.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=135}} Brunius had the organ moved, the crypt repaired, installed a set of steps connecting the choir with the nave and improved the drainage system.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=135}} He also removed modern furnishings, re-built some of the buttresses and changed the stone of a large part of the facade.{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=121}} Brunius retired due to old age in 1859, but as there was still a substantial need for repairs, the young architect [[Helgo Zettervall]] appointed to carry out the rest of the work in 1860.{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=121\u2013122}} A conflict between Brunius and Zettervall developed almost immediately, but Zettervall would keep working on restoring the cathedral until 1893 and ultimately got his will through, for the most part.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=135}}{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=121\u2013181}} A compromise in 1862 proposed that the Danish architect [[Ferdinand Meldahl]] would assume the main responsibility, and Zettervall would merely assist Meldahl. However, it soon became apparent that Zettervall would not accept a subordinate role and Meldahl himself showed little interest in the project.{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=141}} In 1862 Zettervall traveled extensively through Germany and Italy to study stylistically related architecture, and also to visit the latest examples of building restoration so that he could draw upon that experience in his work at Lund.{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=134\u2013141}} In 1863, he presented a first proposal for a complete restoration of the cathedral. Zettervall himself considered it a \"reasonable middle ground between reparation and reconstruction\".{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=142}} The proposal would mean the removal of all buttresses, a new roof, completely rebuilt towers, and the removal of the large Gothic windows in the transepts. Zettervall also proposed to add an octagonal dome over the [[Crossing (architecture)|crossing]]. Far-reaching changes would also affect the interior. In the proposal Zettervall strove to reduce and refine the building volumes of the cathedral and create a unified composition of block-like elements.{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=142\u2212152}}\n\nThe proposal by Zettervall was criticised, not least by Meldahl. Zettervall re-worked the proposal and put forward a revised, less far-reaching proposal in 1864, notably without the central dome.{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=152}} This proposal was also rejected and the plan for a complete overhaul abandoned; however it was at the same time decided that Zettervall would continue working on repairing the cathedral and every year make what changes that were deemed necessary. In this way, Zettervall could piecemeal over the next decades in effect rebuild the cathedral largely in line with the proposal from 1864.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=135}}{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=158\u2013159}}\n\nThe cathedral was radically transformed by the work of Brunius and Zettervall. All windows were replaced, several vaults and pillars were repaired or rebuilt, and both architects effected extensive changes to the transept.

Behind them a [[nave]] with two [[aisle]] opens up to a [[transept]] that is somewhat higher than the nave. A short flight of stairs thus connect the nave with the [[choir (architecture)|choir]] as well as with the crypt under the choir. The choir ends in an apse. Inside, the bays of the cathedral are supported by [[groin vault]]s. The number of bays in the aisles are the double of that in the nave. The arches that separate the nave from the aisles are supported by piers and pillars of alternating width. The crypt has over forty shallow [[groin vault]]s supported by pillars with cushion-cap capitals.

These sculptures have probably been the subject of more attempts at an explanation than any other medieval artworks in Sweden.{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=77}} Most scholars today believe the larger sculpture depicts [[Samson]], but what the smaller figure is supposed to represent is not know. The sculptures date from the construction of the crypt but have been treated poorly, especially during the 18th century, and lost much of their original detailing.{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=77}}\n\nThe fluted columns also found in the crypt are similar in style to [[Norman architecture|English Norman architecture]] and may indicate that the very first artistic influences came from the area bordering the [[English Channel]].{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=64\u201365}} Apart from these columns however, the rich stone ornamentation is clearly Lombard in style, i.e. related to north Italian art of the period.{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=66}} Among these is a [[baldachin]] now immured in the east wall of the north transept which may have been part of the original western facade; Its columns have [[Corinthian order|Corinthian capitals]] and support a richly decorated archivolt on which traces of original paint survives. Opposite, in the south wall, is a smaller baldachin where the columns themselves are sculpted angels (one with [[feather tights]]) standing on lions. Similar sculptures exist in e.g. [[Como]] and Modena in northern Italy.{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=74\u201375}} In addition, the capitals of the columns in the church are all of high artisanal quality, and can be broadly divided into two groups displaying either [[Classical architecture|Classical]] or [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] influences.{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=75}} Apart from its rich Romanesque decoration, Lund Cathedral also contains several late medieval sculptures made by Adam van D\u00fcren, as mentioned above. Several of these are of animals and contain inscriptions in [[Low German]]. A relief in the south transept displaying the [[Woman of the Apocalypse]] flanked by Saint Lawrence and Saint Canute is similar to the portal relief van D\u00fcren made a couple of years earlier at [[Glimmingehus]].{{sfn|Svanberg|1996|p=196\u2013197}}\n\n===Altarpiece===\nThe medieval main [[altarpiece]] was donated to the cathedral in 1398 by [[Ide Pedersdatter Falk]].<ref name=kor>{{cite web |url= https://lundsdomkyrka.se/rundtur/hogkoret/|title= Gyllene mosaik och korstolar fr\u00e5n 1300-talet|trans-title= Golden mosaics and choir stalls from the 14th century|author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= Lund Cathedral (official site)|publisher= Church of Sweden|access-date= 19 April 2020|quote=}}</ref> The altarpiece is stylistically similar to a group of altarpieces from northern Germany. Its central panel depicts the [[Coronation of the Virgin]], surrounded by two rows of 40 saints, 26 of which are original. 12 figures have been taken from other medieval altarpieces, while two of the added figures are from the 17th century.

The wooden stalls date from the end of the 14th century, probably commissioned by archbishop Nils J\u00f6nson some time between 1361 and 1379. They were clearly made by several different wood carvers. They are approximately {{convert|3|m|ft}} tall without their gables and decorated with carved details. These are biblical scenes from both the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]], but the stalls also contain [[misericord]]s portraying animals and other small details. Their style is [[Gothic art|High Gothic]] and they are stylistically linked with contemporary art from the Rhine Valley. They are among the largest wooden Gothic sculptures to survive in the Nordic countries, and have been described as being of internationally high quality.{{sfn|Wrangel|1915|p=24\u201332}} The choir stalls in Lund Cathedral also lent stylistic inspiration to the choir stalls in [[Roskilde Cathedral]] and [[St. Bendt's Church, Ringsted]].{{sfn|Wrangel|1915|p=24\u201332}}{{sfn|Dun\u00e9r|1984|p=1\u20139}}\n\nSlightly older than the choir stalls is a [[Cathedra|bishop's throne]] which survives in a damaged state and is placed in the south transept.

The upper part, which is original, is the clock, while the lower part, a reconstruction, is a calendar. Twice every day the two knights on the top clash their swords. The clock then plays the tune ''[[In dulci jubilo]]'' and a procession of figures parades across the face of the clock.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=125\u2013126}} Three astronomical clocks of similar design are preserved in Europe.

Two of the bronze columns are crowned by angels, and the third one by a statuette of Saint Lawrence, holding a gridiron, the symbol of his martyrdom. It probably dates from the middle of the 14th century, while the two angel-bearing columns may be somewhat later.

It is of a kind which is not unusual in continental Europe but very unusual in the Nordic countries: a large stone sarcophagus decorated on all sides with sculptures in high relief and with a full-scale depiction of the bishop in full dress on the lid. It was made by Adam van D\u00fcren in 1512.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=94}}{{sfn|Wrangel|1915|p=48\u201349}} The cathedral's largest grave monument is that of bishop [[Hans Brostorp]], who died in 1497 and who during his lifetime inaugurated the [[University of Copenhagen]].

In the post-World War II construction boom, changes in zoning regulations and the widespread use of air conditioning led to the design of sealed glass and steel towers. Without natural sources of light and ventilation, such buildings required large amounts of fossil fuels to operate.\n\nThis phase of building style is rapidly changing in New York, which has become a leader in energy-efficient green office buildings like [[7 World Trade Center]], which recycles rainwater and uses it in toilets and for irrigation, and computer-controlled heating and lighting. The United States Green Building Council estimates 3,000 new green apartments in New York City have been built since 2001.\n\nIn 2000 the state of New York introduced a green building tax credit, the first one of its kind in the United States, that has allowed some developers of environmentally friendly buildings to write off as much as $6 million on their tax bill. The city's Department of Design and Construction developed a set of guidelines in 1999 that encourage environmentally sound building methods for municipal projects. The guidelines had led to approximately $700 million in green city construction projects by the end of 2005.<ref>[http://www.gothamgazette.com/article/issueoftheweek/20040105/200/817 \"Green Buildings.\" ''Gotham Gazette'' 5 January 2004]</ref> In 2005, New York City mandated that nonresidential public buildings costing $2 million or more be built to standards set by [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED), which grade buildings in areas like energy and water consumption, [[indoor air quality]] and use of renewable materials. The legislation also applies to private projects that receive $10 million or more in public funds or half of whose budgets come from public money.\n\n==Air pollution==\nPrior to the passage of the federal [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act of 1970]] and other local and state regulations in the late 60s, New York City suffered severe [[smog]], with several instances of major smog events like the [[1966 New York City smog]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/29/nyregion/you-should-have-seen-air-53-after-sept-11-considering-history-s-lessons.html |first=Kirk |last=Johnson |title=You Should Have Seen the Air in '53; After Sept. 11, Considering History's Lessons on Pollution |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 29, 2002 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150527215547/http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/29/nyregion/you-should-have-seen-air-53-after-sept-11-considering-history-s-lessons.html |archivedate=May 27, 2015| url-status=live}}</ref> \n\n===High cancer risk from airborne chemicals===\n\nAccording to the most recent [[Environmental Protection Agency]] National-Scale Air Toxics Assessment study,<ref>{{cite web |title=US Environmental Protection Agency |url=http://www.epa.gov/nata2002/tables.html |work=National-Scale Air Toxics Assessment 2002 County-Level Modeled Ambient Concentrations, Exposures, and Risks |accessdate=August 27, 2011 |year=2002 |quote=The risk estimates are limited to consideration of inhalation exposure.

A large percentage of the city-owned vehicle fleet, including the personal cars of top city officials, are required since 2005 to be fuel efficient hybrid vehicles like the [[Toyota Prius]] or [[Honda Accord]] gas-electric sedan that produce minimal particulates and carbon dioxide emissions. In 2005 the city's vehicle fleet had 6,000 alternative fuel and 70 electric vehicles.

Because the watershed is in one of the largest protected wilderness areas in the United States, the natural water filtration process remains intact. As a result, New York is one of only five major cities in the United States with drinking water pure enough to require only chlorination to ensure its purity at the tap under normal conditions.<ref>[http://www.nyc.gov/html/dep/html/news/tokyo2.html \"Maintaining Water Quality that Satisfies Customers: New York City Watershed Agricultural Program\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012182905/http://www.nyc.gov/html/dep/html/news/tokyo2.html |date=October 12, 2006 }}, ''New York City Department of Environmental Protection'', November 20, 1998.</ref><ref>[http://www.nyc.gov/html/dep/html/drinking_water/wsstate.shtml \"2010 Drinking Water Supply and Quality Report\"], \"City of New York Department of Environmental Protection\" 2011.</ref>\n\nHowever, all groundwater entering New York City's distribution system is treated with [[chlorine]], [[fluoride]], food-grade phosphoric acid, and, in some cases, [[sodium hydroxide]]. New York City uses chlorine to meet the New York State Sanitary Code and federal Safe Drinking Water Act disinfection requirements. Fluoride, at a concentration of one part per million, is added to help prevent tooth decay and has been added since 1966 in accordance with the New York City Health Code. Phosphoric acid is added to create a protective film on pipes that reduces the release of metals such as lead and copper from household plumbing. Additionally, a sequestering phosphate is applied at several wells to prevent the precipitation of naturally occurring minerals, mostly iron and manganese, in the distribution mains and customers' household piping. Air stripper facilities can be operated at several wells to remove volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The only well in operation in 2007 had an air stripper in operation.<ref>[http://nyc.gov/html/dep/html/drinking_water/groundwater.shtml#treatment New York City Groundwater System for 2007 - Treatment]</ref>\n\n[[File:Ashokan Reservoir.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Ashokan Reservoir]] is one of several providing drinking water for New York City.]]\n\nThe complex [[New York City water supply system]]&mdash;with 19 reservoirs bringing mountain water from as far as {{convert|125|mi|km}} away through a gravity-fed web of aqueducts &mdash; consists of three different systems. The [[New Croton Reservoir|Croton]] system, the oldest and smallest section, sits in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] and [[Putnam County, New York|Putnam]] Counties. The second oldest is the Catskill system. In the early years of the 20th century, the city and state designated thousands of acres the eastern Catskills to build two reservoirs that more than doubled the city's capacity. In the 1950s and 1960s, the city expanded again, tapping the east and west branches of the [[Delaware River]] and other tributaries to create the newest and largest of its three systems.\n\nThe Croton system is the source of some [[turbidity]] issues for the city's water. The turbidity problem stems largely from conditions that have been present in the Catskill system from the beginning. Engineering studies in 1903 recognized that the clay of the steeply sloped Eastern Catskills turned the clear waters of the Schoharie and Esopus Creeks muddy after storms.\n\nEngineers decided to go ahead anyway, devising a two-reservoir system with built-in turbidity controls. The city has sought to restrict development throughout its watershed.  One of its largest watershed protection programs is the Land Acquisition Program, under which the New York City Department of Environmental Protection has purchased or protected through conservation easement over 70,000 acres (280&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) since 1997.<ref>\"New York\u2019s Water Supply May Need Filtering.\" July 20, 2006 ''The New York Times'' [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/20/nyregion/20water.html?hp&ex=1153454400&en=2be183debc88eae7&ei=5094&partner=homepage]</ref>\n\nIn the 12 months that ended on June 30, 2006, daily consumption averaged {{convert|1.086|e9USgal|m3}} in the city, a decline of 5.2% since 2002 and the lowest total daily use since 1951, when the city had about 7.9 million people and New York was experiencing a severe drought. Daily consumption peaked at {{convert|1.512|e9USgal|m3}} in 1979; in the next year\u2019s census, the city\u2019s population was 7.1 million, its lowest since 1930. Despite having grown to a population of 8.2 million in 2006, the city is now using 28% less water than it did in 1979. The drop in consumption is mostly a result of city policy; water-saving plumbing fixtures and devices in renovations and new construction are required, the city has been more diligent in finding and fixing leaks, and since the late 1980s it has been metering residential customers\u2019 water use. The city uses sonar and other equipment to more efficiently find and fix leaks in its millions of feet of water mains and has taken steps like installing sprinkler caps on fire hydrants during the summer, letting overheated kids cool off without torrents of gushing water.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/03/nyregion/03water.html \"More Masses Huddling, but They Use Less Water\"], ''New York Times'', October 3, 2006.</ref>\n\n==Garbage disposal==\nIn September 2012, ''[[Travel+Leisure]]'' named New York City the #1 \"America's Dirtiest City\", from the results of a readership survey rating 35 \"Favorite Cities\" in the United States.\n\nIn 2001 Mayor [[Rudolph Giuliani]] closed the [[Fresh Kills Landfill]] on [[Staten Island]]. The City did not have a subsequent plan for garbage disposal. An interim system was put in place in which most of the city's garbage was trucked out of the city to land fills in other states. This generated an unacceptable amount of truck traffic in low-income neighborhoods, leading to exacerbated air pollution.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} In 2006 Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]] signed legislation establishing a new solid waste management plan, which will use barges and trains to export 90% of the city\u2019s 12,000 daily tons of residential trash. Under the previous scheme trucks and tractor-trailers were used for 84% of the trash. Passage of the new legislation was delayed by opponents in a Manhattan neighborhood who protested the use of a marine transfer station in the [[Hudson River Park]]. Environmentalists and social activists argued the plan promoted [[environmental justice]] because no one borough or neighborhood would bear a disproportionate burden under the proposal, and they therefore supported it.\n\n==Other issues==\nMuch of the city's housing stock is old, and lead paint is an ongoing public health issue. Some parts of the city are also at risk if current global warming patterns continue and sea levels rise.\n\nThe city is home to several thriving non-native species of plants and animals. Populations of wild South American [[monk parakeet]]s, also known as the Quaker parrot, live in Greenwood Cemetery, Marine Park, Bensonhurst, and Bay Ridge in Brooklyn, and in the East Bronx.\n\nA 2014 paper estimated the [[rats in New York City|rat population of New York City]] proper to be about 2 million, or one for every four people.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Does New York City really have as many rats as people? |author=Jonathan Auerbach |date=October 3, 2014 |journal=Significance |volume=11 |issue=4 |doi=10.1111/j.1740-9713.2014.00764.x |pages=22\u201327}}</ref>\n\n===Farmers' markets===\n{{main article|Food and water in New York City#Greenmarket}}\n[[File:Union Square Farmers Market.jpg|thumb|The [[farmers' market]] at [[Union Square (New York City)|Union Square]].]]\nIn 1976 the Council on the Environment of New York City established the Greenmarket program, which provides regional small family farmers opportunities to sell their fruits, vegetables and other farm products at open-air markets in city public squares. The Greenmarket program manages 45 markets in the five boroughs. More than 100 New York City restaurants source their ingredients from Greenmarket farmers each week; Greenmarket farmers also annually donate about 500,000 pounds of food to City Harvest and other hunger relief organizations each year. The most famous location is the Union Square Greenmarket, held Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. year-round. The market has 250,000 customers a week who purchase 1,000 varieties of fruits and vegetables at the market.\n\nThe markets are anchored by 164 farmers who travel a median distance of {{convert|90|mi|km}}, including 90 vegetable and orchard growers, 29 meat, dairy, poultry, wool and fish producers, 12 producers of honey, [[maple syrup]], jam, and wine, 19 growers of plants and flowers, and 14 bakers.\n\nIn 2006 the City Council announced it would make [[farmers' market]]s the centerpiece of efforts to reduce hunger and increase awareness of nutrition in the city, especially in lower-income areas, and that 10 new farmers' markets would open serving low-income neighborhoods including [[public housing]] projects.\n\n===Greenpoint oil spill===\n{{main article|Greenpoint oil spill}}\nThe [[Greenpoint, Brooklyn|Greenpoint]] neighborhood of Brooklyn was once home to many [[oil refineries]] for more than a century.

Authorities have been aware of the problem since 1978. [[Exxon Mobil]] accepted responsibility for much of the damage in 1990 and has since pumped some {{convert|9|e6USgal|m3}} out of the ground.\n\nThe slow pace of the cleanup, however, has increasingly angered Greenpoint residents and elected officials, who have launched a series of lawsuits against Exxon in 2004. In June 2006 the [[New York State Department of Environmental Conservation]] announced it would sue Exxon Mobil to hasten completion of the cleanup.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Climate change in New York City]]\n*[[Health effects arising from the September 11 attacks]]\n*[[OneNYC]]\n*[[PlaNYC]]\n*[[New York City Department of Environmental Protection]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.nyc.gov/html/oec/html/home/home.shtml New York City Office of Environmental Coordination]\n*[https://aerostate.io/blog/Air-quality-in-New-York-and-Manhattan.html Air quality in New York and Manhattan]\n\n{{New York City}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Environmental Issues In New York City}}\n[[Category:Environmental issues in New York City|New York]]\n[[Category:Recycling in New York City]]\n[[Category:Environmental justice in New York City]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=May 2017}}\n[[File:Jacqueline_Kennedy_Onassis_Reservoir.jpg|275px|thumb|alt=Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir in Central Park|[[Central Park]]'s reservoirs were historically important components of the [[New York City water supply system]].]]\n'''Environmental issues in [[New York City]]''' are  affected by the city's size, density, [[Transportation in New York City|abundant public transportation infrastructure]], and location at the mouth of the [[Hudson River]].\n\nNew York's population density has environmental pros and cons.

In the post-World War II construction boom, changes in zoning regulations and the widespread use of air conditioning led to the design of sealed glass and steel towers. Without natural sources of light and ventilation, such buildings required large amounts of fossil fuels to operate.\n\nThis phase of building style is rapidly changing in New York, which has become a leader in energy-efficient green office buildings like [[7 World Trade Center]], which recycles rainwater and uses it in toilets and for irrigation, and computer-controlled heating and lighting. The United States Green Building Council estimates 3,000 new green apartments in New York City have been built since 2001.\n\nIn 2000 the state of New York introduced a green building tax credit, the first one of its kind in the United States, that has allowed some developers of environmentally friendly buildings to write off as much as $6 million on their tax bill. The city's Department of Design and Construction developed a set of guidelines in 1999 that encourage environmentally sound building methods for municipal projects. The guidelines had led to approximately $700 million in green city construction projects by the end of 2005.<ref>[http://www.gothamgazette.com/article/issueoftheweek/20040105/200/817 \"Green Buildings.\" ''Gotham Gazette'' 5 January 2004]</ref> In 2005, New York City mandated that nonresidential public buildings costing $2 million or more be built to standards set by [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED), which grade buildings in areas like energy and water consumption, [[indoor air quality]] and use of renewable materials.

Because the watershed is in one of the largest protected wilderness areas in the United States, the natural water filtration process remains intact. As a result, New York is one of only five major cities in the United States with drinking water pure enough to require only chlorination to ensure its purity at the tap under normal conditions.<ref>[http://www.nyc.gov/html/dep/html/news/tokyo2.html \"Maintaining Water Quality that Satisfies Customers: New York City Watershed Agricultural Program\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012182905/http://www.nyc.gov/html/dep/html/news/tokyo2.html |date=October 12, 2006 }}, ''New York City Department of Environmental Protection'', November 20, 1998.</ref><ref>[http://www.nyc.gov/html/dep/html/drinking_water/wsstate.shtml \"2010 Drinking Water Supply and Quality Report\"], \"City of New York Department of Environmental Protection\" 2011.</ref>\n\nHowever, all groundwater entering New York City's distribution system is treated with [[chlorine]], [[fluoride]], food-grade phosphoric acid, and, in some cases, [[sodium hydroxide]]. New York City uses chlorine to meet the New York State Sanitary Code and federal Safe Drinking Water Act disinfection requirements. Fluoride, at a concentration of one part per million, is added to help prevent tooth decay and has been added since 1966 in accordance with the New York City Health Code. Phosphoric acid is added to create a protective film on pipes that reduces the release of metals such as lead and copper from household plumbing. Additionally, a sequestering phosphate is applied at several wells to prevent the precipitation of naturally occurring minerals, mostly iron and manganese, in the distribution mains and customers' household piping. Air stripper facilities can be operated at several wells to remove volatile organic compounds (VOCs).

The [[New Croton Reservoir|Croton]] system, the oldest and smallest section, sits in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] and [[Putnam County, New York|Putnam]] Counties. The second oldest is the Catskill system. In the early years of the 20th century, the city and state designated thousands of acres the eastern Catskills to build two reservoirs that more than doubled the city's capacity. In the 1950s and 1960s, the city expanded again, tapping the east and west branches of the [[Delaware River]] and other tributaries to create the newest and largest of its three systems.\n\nThe Croton system is the source of some [[turbidity]] issues for the city's water. The turbidity problem stems largely from conditions that have been present in the Catskill system from the beginning. Engineering studies in 1903 recognized that the clay of the steeply sloped Eastern Catskills turned the clear waters of the Schoharie and Esopus Creeks muddy after storms.\n\nEngineers decided to go ahead anyway, devising a two-reservoir system with built-in turbidity controls. The city has sought to restrict development throughout its watershed.  One of its largest watershed protection programs is the Land Acquisition Program, under which the New York City Department of Environmental Protection has purchased or protected through conservation easement over 70,000 acres (280&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) since 1997.<ref>\"New York\u2019s Water Supply May Need Filtering.\" July 20, 2006 ''The New York Times'' [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/20/nyregion/20water.html?hp&ex=1153454400&en=2be183debc88eae7&ei=5094&partner=homepage]</ref>\n\nIn the 12 months that ended on June 30, 2006, daily consumption averaged {{convert|1.086|e9USgal|m3}} in the city, a decline of 5.2% since 2002 and the lowest total daily use since 1951, when the city had about 7.9 million people and New York was experiencing a severe drought. Daily consumption peaked at {{convert|1.512|e9USgal|m3}} in 1979; in the next year\u2019s census, the city\u2019s population was 7.1 million, its lowest since 1930. Despite having grown to a population of 8.2 million in 2006, the city is now using 28% less water than it did in 1979. The drop in consumption is mostly a result of city policy; water-saving plumbing fixtures and devices in renovations and new construction are required, the city has been more diligent in finding and fixing leaks, and since the late 1980s it has been metering residential customers\u2019 water use. The city uses sonar and other equipment to more efficiently find and fix leaks in its millions of feet of water mains and has taken steps like installing sprinkler caps on fire hydrants during the summer, letting overheated kids cool off without torrents of gushing water.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/03/nyregion/03water.html \"More Masses Huddling, but They Use Less Water\"], ''New York Times'', October 3, 2006.</ref>\n\n==Garbage disposal==\nIn September 2012, ''[[Travel+Leisure]]'' named New York City the #1 \"America's Dirtiest City\", from the results of a readership survey rating 35 \"Favorite Cities\" in the United States.\n\nIn 2001 Mayor [[Rudolph Giuliani]] closed the [[Fresh Kills Landfill]] on [[Staten Island]].

Passage of the new legislation was delayed by opponents in a Manhattan neighborhood who protested the use of a marine transfer station in the [[Hudson River Park]]. Environmentalists and social activists argued the plan promoted [[environmental justice]] because no one borough or neighborhood would bear a disproportionate burden under the proposal, and they therefore supported it.\n\n==Other issues==\nMuch of the city's housing stock is old, and lead paint is an ongoing public health issue.

The Greenmarket program manages 45 markets in the five boroughs. More than 100 New York City restaurants source their ingredients from Greenmarket farmers each week; Greenmarket farmers also annually donate about 500,000 pounds of food to City Harvest and other hunger relief organizations each year. The most famous location is the Union Square Greenmarket, held Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. year-round. The market has 250,000 customers a week who purchase 1,000 varieties of fruits and vegetables at the market.\n\nThe markets are anchored by 164 farmers who travel a median distance of {{convert|90|mi|km}}, including 90 vegetable and orchard growers, 29 meat, dairy, poultry, wool and fish producers, 12 producers of honey, [[maple syrup]], jam, and wine, 19 growers of plants and flowers, and 14 bakers.\n\nIn 2006 the City Council announced it would make [[farmers' market]]s the centerpiece of efforts to reduce hunger and increase awareness of nutrition in the city, especially in lower-income areas, and that 10 new farmers' markets would open serving low-income neighborhoods including [[public housing]] projects.\n\n===Greenpoint oil spill===\n{{main article|Greenpoint oil spill}}\nThe [[Greenpoint, Brooklyn|Greenpoint]] neighborhood of Brooklyn was once home to many [[oil refineries]] for more than a century.

A move to [[League of Wales]] club Barry Town beckoned in 2000. After forty goals in two seasons, including a goal in a 3\u20131 win over [[F.C. Porto]] in the second qualifying round of the Champions League, he moved to [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] in the [[2002-03 in English football|2002\u201303 season]].\n\nFlynn spent a lot of his time on the substitutes' bench as Wigan won [[Football League Division Two|Division Two]] title. He made seventeen appearances in the league, fourteen of which came from the bench, and scored one goal. The next season did not start any better for Flynn as he started just one game and made seven appearances from the bench before he was loaned to then League One side [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]], where he started six times in the league and once in the [[FA Cup]] before returning to Wigan.\n\nIn the January [[transfer window]] of [[2004-05 in English football|that season]], Flynn joined [[Football League Championship|Championship]] strugglers Gillingham on a [[free transfer (football)|free transfer]].

He made his debut four days later in the 5\u20130 defeat by [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] at [[Meadow Lane]] and scored his first goal of the 2011\u201312 season in a 3\u20132 loss to Leeds United. On 28 April 2012 it was announced that he would leave Bradford as his contract was ended by mutual consent along with teammates [[Chris Mitchell (footballer born 1988)|Chris Mitchell]] and [[Craig Fagan]].\n\nOn 25 July 2012 he re-signed for home-town club Newport County.

A move to [[League of Wales]] club Barry Town beckoned in 2000. After forty goals in two seasons, including a goal in a 3\u20131 win over [[F.C. Porto]] in the second qualifying round of the Champions League, he moved to [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] in the [[2002-03 in English football|2002\u201303 season]].\n\nFlynn spent a lot of his time on the substitutes' bench as Wigan won [[Football League Division Two|Division Two]] title.

He returned to Huddersfield on 29 December.\n\nOn 4 August 2009, Flynn joined local rivals Bradford City on a [[Bosman ruling|free transfer]]. He made his debut four days later in the 5\u20130 defeat by [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] at [[Meadow Lane]] and scored his first goal of the 2011\u201312 season in a 3\u20132 loss to Leeds United. On 28 April 2012 it was announced that he would leave Bradford as his contract was ended by mutual consent along with teammates [[Chris Mitchell (footballer born 1988)|Chris Mitchell]] and [[Craig Fagan]].\n\nOn 25 July 2012 he re-signed for home-town club Newport County.

However, on March 4, the first day of the event, Kostornaia withdrew from the competition due to a medical condition, subsequently revealed by choreographer [[Daniil Gleikhengauz]] to be a leg inflammation that would require four weeks away from training.

However, her lead from the short program was enough not only to win her the title by almost 7 points over Shcherbakova, but also to help her break the [[List of highest scores in figure skating#Best total scores 2|world record for the combined total score in ladies' singles skating]], previously held by Alexandra Trusova. She became the fifth figure skater in any discipline to win the [[ISU Junior Grand Prix Final|Junior Grand Prix Final]] and [[Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final|Grand Prix Final]] in consecutive years.<ref name=GS191208 />\n\nKostornaia competed next at the [[2020 Russian Figure Skating Championships|2020 Russian National championships]], where she again won the short program, setting a ten-point lead over second-place Anna Shcherbakova.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Goh |first1=ZK |title=Alena Kostornaia blows opponents away to lead Russian nationals after short program |url=https://www.olympicchannel.com/en/stories/news/detail/alena-kostornaia-russian-national-figure-skating-short-program/ |website=Olympic Channel}}</ref> However, she made mistakes in the free skate, with imperfect landings on her double Axel and triple flip-triple toe loop combination, and placed second in that segment to become the national silver medalist, two points behind Shcherbakova.

[[Eteri Tutberidze]] and [[Sergei Dudakov]] became her coaches in 2017.<ref name=fskate />\n\n=== 2017\u20132018 season: Junior international debut ===\nKostornaia's international debut came in early October 2017 at a [[2017\u201318 ISU Junior Grand Prix]] (JGP) competition in [[Gdansk]], [[Poland]]; ranked first in the short program and second in the free skate, she won the gold medal by a margin of 1.36 points over the silver medalist, her teammate and training partner [[Daria Panenkova]].<ref name=JGPPOL2017 /> She won silver behind [[Sofia Samodurova]] at [[ISU Junior Grand Prix in Italy|JGP Italy]] by a margin of 0.04 points.<ref name=JGPITA2017 /> Her placements qualified her for the [[2017\u201318 Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final|2017\u201318 Junior Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final]], where she won silver, placing second in the short program, and first in the free skate. On the senior level, Kostornaia won bronze at the [[2018 Russian Figure Skating Championships]]. She later won silver at the [[Russian Junior Figure Skating Championships|2018 Russian Junior Championships]] behind teammate [[Alexandra Trusova]] by a margin of 0.58 points.\n\nIn March 2018, Kostornaia competed at the [[2018 World Junior Figure Skating Championships|2018 World Junior Championships]]. She placed second in the short program and the free skate, winning the silver medal behind Trusova.\n\n=== 2018\u20132019 season ===\n[[File:2019 Russian Figure Skating Championships Alena Kostornaia 2018-12-21 15-29-18 1545444611.jpg|thumb|right|Kostornaia (center) with her coaches at the [[2019 Russian Figure Skating Championships|2019 Russian Championships]].]]\nKostornaia had learned to perform a [[Axel jump|triple Axel]] in the preceding year, and had originally planned to introduce it into competition. However, she lost the jump following growth during the offseason.<ref name=GS181208 /> Kostornaia started her season by competing in the [[2018\u201319 ISU Junior Grand Prix|2018 JGP series]]. At her first JGP event of the season, she won the gold medal in [[Linz]], [[Austria]]. She was ranked first in both the short program and the free skate and won the gold medal by a margin of more than 11 points over the silver medalist, her teammate [[Alena Kanysheva]].<ref name=JGPAUT2018 />\n\nShe skated her second JGP event of the season at [[ISU Junior Grand Prix in the Czech Republic|JGP Ostrava]], where she was again ranked first in both the short program and the free skate. She won the gold medal by a margin of about 2 points over the silver medalist, [[Kim Ye-lim (figure skater)|Kim Ye-lim]].<ref name=JGPCZE2018 /> With two JGP victories, she qualified for the [[2018\u20132019 Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final|2018\u201319 Junior Grand Prix Final]], where she won the gold medal after placing first in both the short program and the free skate. She outscored her teammate and training partner Trusova by about 2.5 points. At this event, Kostornaia scored her personal best score of 217.98 points and she also set a new junior-level ladies' record for the [[List of highest junior scores in figure skating#Short program score 2|short program]] (76.32 points).<ref name=GS181207 /><ref name=GS181208 />\n\nAt the [[2019 Russian Figure Skating Championships|2019 Russian Championships]], Kostornaia placed third in the short program due to a fall during her step sequence, which she attributed to being \"too relaxed\" as she was nearing the end of the program and had already completed all of her jumping passes.<ref name=GS181221 /> She then placed third in the free skate as well, winning her second consecutive national bronze medal.<ref name=GS181222 />\n\nKostornaia participated in the 2019 Russian Junior Championships, where she won the short program and placed second in the free skate. She was ranked second overall, winning her second consecutive junior national silver medal. After the event, she was named to the Russian team for the [[2019 World Junior Figure Skating Championships|2019 World Junior Championships]] along with training mates Trusova and [[Anna Shcherbakova]]. However, on March 4, the first day of the event, Kostornaia withdrew from the competition due to a medical condition, subsequently revealed by choreographer [[Daniil Gleikhengauz]] to be a leg inflammation that would require four weeks away from training. She was replaced by [[Ksenia Sinitsyna]].<ref name=RS190310 />\n\n=== 2019\u20132020 season: Senior international debut and European title ===\nFor her programs, Kostornaia retained her short program from the previous season, and revised a ''[[Twilight (film series)|Twilight]]''-themed exhibition program from the previous year to serve as her free skate, citing how much she enjoyed skating it.<ref name=GS191102 /> Shortly after debuting her programs at the Russian test skates, Kostornaia resumed training the [[Axel jump|triple Axel jump]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fs-gossips.com/alena-kostornaia-of-course-its-very-disappointing-when-everyone-does-it-but-you-dont/|title=Alena Kostornaia: Of course, it's very disappointing when everyone does it, but you don't|last=|first=|date=|website=FS Gossips|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Kostornaia began her season at the [[2019 CS Finlandia Trophy]], marking her senior international debut, where she placed first in both the short program and free skate segments of the event. She incorporated two triple Axels in her free skate, becoming the tenth woman in history to land the jump in an international competition, and earned a total combined score of 234.84, 22.31 points ahead of silver medalist [[Elizaveta Tuktamysheva]].<ref name=OC191014 />\n\n[[File:2019 Internationaux de France Saturday medals ladies 8D9A2656.jpg|thumb|right|Kostornaia (center) with [[Alina Zagitova]] (left) and [[Mariah Bell]] (right) at the [[2019 Internationaux de France]] medal ceremony.]]\nMaking her [[2019-20 ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating|senior Grand Prix]] debut at the [[2019 Internationaux de France]], Kostornaia ranked first in the short program, incorporating a triple Axel into it for the first time.<ref name=GS191101 /> She then became the fourth woman ever, after [[Mao Asada]], [[Rika Kihira]] and Elizaveta Tuktamysheva, to land two fully rotated triple Axels in a free skate, placing first in the segment with a personal best score of 159.45 points. She took the gold medal over training mate and reigning [[2019 World Figure Skating Championships|World]] and [[2018 Winter Olympics|Olympic]] champion [[Alina Zagitova]] by a margin of 19.94 points.<ref name=GS191102 /> At the [[2019 NHK Trophy]], Kostornaia performed a clean short program with a successful triple Axel to place first in that segment, 5.15 points over [[Rika Kihira]], who also landed a triple Axel, and set a new [[List of highest scores in figure skating#Ladies|world record]] score of 85.04 for the ladies' short program at the senior level.<ref name=GS191122 /> In the free, she again placed first and became the champion with a personal best total score of 240.00. Kostornaia thus became the top qualifier for the [[2019\u201320 Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final|Grand Prix Final]] in [[Turin|Torino]], with two gold medal finishes and 30 points overall.<ref name=GS191123 />\n\nAt the [[2019\u201320 Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final|2019\u201320 Grand Prix Final]], she topped her own world record by scoring 85.45 in the short program, placing first.<ref name=GS191206 /> In spite of having the only clean free skate amongst the ladies, Kostornaia ranked second in that segment, 0.51 point behind teammate Anna Shcherbakova. However, her lead from the short program was enough not only to win her the title by almost 7 points over Shcherbakova, but also to help her break the [[List of highest scores in figure skating#Best total scores 2|world record for the combined total score in ladies' singles skating]], previously held by Alexandra Trusova.

{"title_page": "Local average treatment effect", "text_new": "{{tone|date=December 2018}}\nThe '''local average treatment effect (LATE)''', also known as the complier average causal effect (CACE), was first introduced into the econometrics literature by [[Guido Imbens|Guido W. Imbens]] and [[Joshua Angrist|Joshua D. Angrist]] in 1994.<ref name=\"Imbens 467\">{{Cite journal|last=Imbens|first=Guido W.|last2=Angrist|first2=Joshua D.|date=March 1994|title=Identification and Estimation of Local Average Treatment Effects|journal=Econometrica|volume=62|issue=2|pages=467|doi=10.2307/2951620|issn=0012-9682|jstor=2951620|url=http://www.nber.org/papers/t0118.pdf}}</ref> It is the treatment effect for the subset of the sample that takes the treatment if and only if they were assigned to the treatment, otherwise known as the compliers. It is not to be confused with the [[Average treatment effect|average treatment effect (ATE)]], which is the average subject-level treatment effect; the LATE is only the ATE among the compliers. The LATE can be estimated by a ratio of the estimated intent-to-treat effect and the estimated proportion of compliers, or alternatively through an [[Instrumental variables estimation|instrumental variable]] estimator. Since the LATE may not be equivalent to the ATE, we should be cautious of extrapolation.\n\n== General definition ==\nThe ATE is the difference between the expected value of the treatment group and the expected value of the control group. In an experimental setting, random assignment allows us to assume that the treatment group and control group have the same expected potential outcomes when treated (or untreated). This can be expressed as:\n\n<math>E[Y_i(1)|D_i=1]=E[Y_i(1)|D_i=0]=E[Y_i(1)] </math>\n\n<math>E[Y_i(0)|D_i=1]=E[Y_i(0)|D_i=0]=E[Y_i(0)]</math>\n\nIn an ideal experiment, all subjects assigned to treatment are treated, while those that are assigned to control will remain untreated. In reality, however, the compliance rate is rarely perfect, which prevents researchers from identifying the ATE. In such cases, estimating the LATE becomes the more feasible option. The LATE is the average treatment effect among a specific subset of the subjects, who in this case would be the compliers.\n\n== Potential outcome framework and notation ==\nLet  <math>  Y_i(d) </math> denotes the potential outcome of subject i, where d is the binary indicator of subject <math> i </math>\u2019s treatment status. <math> Y_i(1) </math> denotes the treated potential outcome for subject i, while <math>  Y_i(0) </math> denotes the untreated potential outcome.  The causal effect of the treatment on subject <math> i </math> is <math> Y_i(1)-Y_i(0) </math>.  However, we can never observe both  <math> Y_i(1) </math>and <math>  Y_i(0) </math> for the same subject. At any given time, we can only observe a subject in its treated <math> Y_i(1) </math> or untreated <math>  Y_i(0) </math> state.\n\nThrough random assignment, the expected untreated potential outcome of the control group is the same as that of the treatment group, and the expected treated potential outcome of treatment group is the same as that of the control group. The random assignment assumption thus allows us to take the difference between the average outcome in the treatment group and the average outcome in the control group as the overall average treatment effect, such that:\n\n<math>ATE= E[Y_i(1)-Y_i(0)]=E[Y_i(1)]-E[Y_i(0)]=E[Y_i(1)|D_i=1]-E[Y_i(0)|D_i=0] </math>\n\n=== Noncompliance framework ===\nQuite often will researchers encounter noncompliance problems in their experiments, whereby subjects fail to comply with their experimental assignments. Some subjects will not take the treatment when assigned to the treatment group, so their potential outcome of <math> Y_i(1) </math> will not be revealed, while some subjects assigned to the control group will take the treatment, so they will not reveal their <math> Y_i(0) </math>.\n\nGiven noncompliance, the population in an experiment can be divided into four subgroups: compliers, always-takers, never-takers and defiers. We then introduce <math>z</math> as a binary indicator of experimental assignment, such that when <math>z_i = 1</math>, subject <math>i</math> is assigned to treatment, and when <math>z_i=0</math>, subject <math> i </math> is assigned to control. Thus, <math>d_i(z)</math>represents whether subject <math> i </math> is actually treated or not when treatment assignment is <math>z_i</math>.\n\nCompliers are subjects who will take the treatment if and only if they were assigned to the treatment group, i.e. the subpopulation with  <math>d_i(1)=1</math> and <math>d_i(0)=0</math>.\n\nNoncompliers are composed of the three remaining subgroups:\n\n* Always-takers are subjects who will always take the treatment even if they were assigned to the control group, i.e. the subpopulation with <math>d_i(z)=1</math>\n* Never-takers are subjects who will never take the treatment even if they were assigned to the treatment group, i.e. the subpopulation with <math>d_i(z)=0</math>\n* Defiers are subjects who will do the opposite of their treatment assignment status, i.e. the subpopulation with <math>d_i(1)=0</math> and <math>d_i(0)=1\n</math>\n\nNon-compliance can take two forms. In the case of one-sided non-compliance, a number of the subjects who were assigned to the treatment group remain untreated. Subjects are thus divided into compliers and never-takers, such that <math>d_i(0) = 0</math>for all <math>i</math>, while <math>d_i(1)= </math>  0 or 1. In the case of two-sided non-compliance, a number of the subjects assigned to the treatment group fail to receive the treatment, while a number of the subjects assigned to the control group receive the treatment. In this case, subjects are divided into the four subgroups, such that both <math>d_i(0)</math> and <math>d_i(1)</math> can be 0 or 1.\n\nGiven non-compliance, we require certain assumptions to estimate the LATE. Under one-sided non-compliance, we assume non-interference and excludability. Under two-sided non-compliance, we assume non-interference, excludability, and monotonicity.\n\n=== Assumptions under one-sided non-compliance ===\n\n* The non-interference assumption, otherwise known as the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA), is composed of two parts.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rubin|first=Donald B.|date=January 1978|title=Bayesian Inference for Causal Effects: The Role of Randomization|journal=The Annals of Statistics|volume=6|issue=1|pages=34\u201358|doi=10.1214/aos/1176344064|issn=0090-5364|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n** The first part of this assumption stipulates that the actual treatment status, <math>d_i</math>, of subject <math>i</math> depends only on the subject's own treatment assignment status, <math>z_i</math>.

Formally, if <math>z_i=z_i'</math>, then <math>D_i(\\mathbf{z})=D_i(\\mathbf{z}')</math>, where <math>\\mathbf{z}</math> denotes the vector of treatment assignment status for all individuals.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Angrist|first=Joshua D.|last2=Imbens|first2=Guido W.|last3=Rubin|first3=Donald B.|date=June 1996|title=Identification of Causal Effects Using Instrumental Variables|journal=Journal of the American Statistical Association|volume=91|issue=434|pages=444\u2013455|doi=10.1080/01621459.1996.10476902|issn=0162-1459|url=http://www.nber.org/papers/t0136.pdf}}</ref>\n** The second part of this assumption stipulates that subject <math> i </math>'s potential outcomes are affected by its own treatment assignment, and the treatment it receives as a consequence of that assignment.

Formally, if <math>z_i=z_i'</math> and <math>d_i=d_i'</math>, then <math>Y_i(z,d)=Y_i(z',d)</math>.\n** The plausibility of the non-interference assumption must be assessed on a case-by-case basis.\n* The excludability assumption requires that potential outcomes respond to treatment itself, <math>d_i</math>, not treatment assignment, <math>z_i</math>. Formally <math>  Y_i(z,d)=Y_i(d) </math>. So under this assumption, only <math> d </math>matters.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Imbens|first=G. W.|last2=Rubin|first2=D.

This states that whenever a subject moves from the control to treatment group, <math> d_i </math> either remains unchanged or increases.

In an experiment with perfect compliance, the average treatment effect can be obtained easily. However, many experiments are likely to experience either one-sided or two-sided non-compliance. In the presence of non-compliance, the ATE can no longer be recovered. Instead, what is recovered is the average treatment effect for a certain subpopulation known as the compliers, which is the LATE.\n\nWhen there may exist heterogeneous treatment effects across groups, the LATE is unlikely to be equivalent to the ATE. In one example, Angrist (1989)<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Angrist|first=Joshua|date=September 1990|title=The Draft Lottery and Voluntary Enlistment in the Vietnam Era|location=Cambridge, MA|doi=10.3386/w3514|doi-access=free}}</ref> attempts to estimate the causal effect of serving in the military on earnings, using the draft lottery as an [[Instrumental variables estimation|instrument]]. The compliers are those who were induced by the draft lottery to serve in the military. If the research interest is on how to compensate those involuntarily taxed by the draft, LATE would be useful, since the research targets compliers.

Thus, to retrieve the ATE, it is necessary to reweight based on the information gleaned from compliers. There are a number of ways that reweighting can be used to try to get at the ATE from the LATE.\n\n==== Reweighting by ignorability assumption ====\nBy leveraging [[Instrumental variables estimation|instrumental variable]], Aronow and Carnegie (2013)<ref name=\":0b\" /> propose a new reweighting method called Inverse Compliance Score weighting (ICSW), with a similar intuition behind [[Inverse probability weighting|IPW]]. This method assumes compliance propensity is a pre-treatment covariate and compliers would have the same average treatment effect within their strata. ICSW first estimates the conditional probability of being a complier (Compliance Score) for each subject by [[Maximum likelihood estimation|Maximum Likelihood estimator]] given covariates control, then reweights each unit by its inverse of compliance score, so that compliers would have covariate distribution that matches the full population. ICSW is applicable at both [[Local Average Treatment Effect|one-sided]] and [[Local Average Treatment Effect|two-sided noncompliance]] situation.\n\nAlthough one's compliance score cannot be directly observed, the probability of compliance can be estimated by observing the compliance condition from the same strata,&nbsp; in other words those that share the same covariate profile. The compliance score is treated as a latent pretreatment covariate, which is independent of treatment assignment <math>Z</math>. For each unit <math>i</math>, compliance score is denoted as <math display=\"inline\">P_{Ci}=Pr(D_1>D_0|X=x_i)</math>, where <math>x_i</math>is the covariate vector for unit <math>i </math>.\n\nIn [[Local Average Treatment Effect|one-sided noncompliance]] case,&nbsp; the population consists of only compliers and never-takers. All units assigned to the treatment group that take the treatment will be compliers. Thus, a simple bivariate regression of D on X can predict the probability of compliance.\n\nIn [[Local Average Treatment Effect|two-sided noncompliance]] case, compliance score is estimated using [[maximum likelihood estimation]].\n\nBy assuming [[Probit model|probit distribution]] for compliance and of Bernoulli distribution of D,\n\nwhere&nbsp;<math>\\hat{\\Pr{c_i}}=\\hat{\\Pr}(D_1>D_0|X=x_i)=F(\\hat{\\theta}_{A,C,x_i})(1-F(\\hat{\\theta}_{A|A,C,x_i}))^3</math> .\n\nand&nbsp;<math>\\theta</math> is a vector of covariates to be estimated, <math>F(.)</math> is the cumulative distribution function for a [[probit model]]\n\n* ICSW estimator\n\nBy the LATE theorem,<ref name=\"Imbens 467\"/>&nbsp; [[Local Average Treatment Effect|average treatment effect for compliers]] can be estimated with equation:\n\n<math>\\tau_{LATE}=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n {Z_i}{Y_i}/\\sum_{i=1}^n {Z_i}-\\sum_{i=1}^n {(1-Z_i)}{Y_i}/\\sum_{i=1}^n {(1-Z_i)}}{\n    \\sum_{i=1}^n {Z_i}{D_i}/\\sum_{i=1}^n {Z_i}-\\sum_{i=1}^n {(1-Z_i)}{D_i}/\\sum_{i=1}^n {(1-Z_i)}}\n</math>\n\nDefine <math>\\hat{w_{Ci}}=1/\\hat{Pr_{Ci}}</math> the ICSW estimator&nbsp; &nbsp;is simply&nbsp; weighted by&nbsp; :\n\n<math>\\tau_{ATE}=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n \\hat{W_i}{Z_i}{Y_i}/\\sum_{i=1}^n \\hat{W_i}{Z_i}-\\sum_{i=1}^n \\hat{W_i}{(1-Z_i)}{Y_i}/\\sum_{i=1}^n {\\hat{W_i}(1-Z_i)}}{\n    \\sum_{i=1}^n \\hat{W_i}{Z_i}{D_i}/\\sum_{i=1}^n \\hat{W_i}{Z_i}-\\sum_{i=1}^n \\hat{W_i}{(1-Z_i)}{D_i}/\\sum_{i=1}^n \\hat{W_i}{(1-Z_i)}}\n</math>\n\nThis estimator is equivalent to using [[2SLS]] estimator with weight .\n\n* Core assumptions under reweighting\n\nAn essential assumption of ICSW relying on&nbsp; treatment homogeneity within strata, which means the treatment effect should on average be the same for everyone in the strata, not just for the compliers. If this assumption holds, LATE is equal to ATE within some covariate profile. Denote as:\n\n<math>\\text{for all }x \\in Supp(X), E[Y_1-Y_0|D_1>D_0]</math>\n\nNotice this is a less restrictive assumption than the traditional [[ignorability]] assumption, as this only concerns the covariate sets that are relevant to compliance score, which further leads to heterogeneity, without considering all sets of covariates.\n\nThe second assumption is consistency of&nbsp; <math>\\hat{Pr_{Ci}}</math>&nbsp;for <math>Pr_{Ci}</math>&nbsp;and the third assumption is the nonzero compliance for each strata, which is an extension of IV assumption of nonzero compliance over population. This is a reasonable assumption as if compliance score is zero for certain strata, the inverse of it would be infinite.\n\nICSW estimator is more sensible than that of IV estimator, as it incorporate more covariate information, such that the estimator might have higher variances. This is a general problem for IPW-style estimation. The problem is exaggerated when there is only a small population in certain strata and compliance rate is low.&nbsp; One way to compromise it to winsorize the estimates, in this paper they set the threshold as =0.275. If compliance score for lower than 0.275, it is replaced by this value. Bootstrap is also recommended in the entire process to reduce uncertainty(Abadie 2002).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Abadie|first=Alberto|date=March 2002|title=Bootstrap Tests for Distributional Treatment Effects in Instrumental Variable Models|journal=Journal of the American Statistical Association|volume=97|issue=457|pages=284\u2013292|doi=10.1198/016214502753479419|issn=0162-1459|citeseerx=10.1.1.337.3129}}</ref>\n\n==== Reweighting under monotonicity assumption ====\n{{more citations needed|section|date=December 2018}}\nIn another approach, one might assume that an underlying utility model links the never-takers, compliers, and always-takers. The ATE can be estimated by reweighting based on an extrapolation of the complier treated and untreated potential outcomes to the never-takers and always-takers. The following method is one that has been proposed by Amanda Kowalski.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nFirst, all subjects are assumed to have a utility function, determined by their individual gains from treatment and costs from treatment. Based on an underlying assumption of monotonicity, the never-takers, compliers, and always-takers can be arranged on the same continuum based on their utility function. This assumes that the always-takers have such a high utility from taking the treatment that they will take it even without encouragement. On the other hand, the never-takers have such a low utility function that they will not take the treatment despite encouragement. Thus, the never-takers can be aligned with the compliers with the lowest utilities, and the always-takers with the compliers with the highest utility functions.\n\nIn an experimental population, several aspects can be observed: the treated potential outcomes of the always-takers (those who are treated in the control group); the untreated potential outcomes of the never-takers (those who remain untreated in the treatment group); the treated potential outcomes of the always-takers and compliers (those who are treated in the treatment group); and the untreated potential outcomes of the compliers and never-takers (those who are untreated in the control group). However, the treated and untreated potential outcomes of the compliers should be extracted from the latter two observations. To do so, the LATE must be extracted from the treated population.\n\nAssuming no defiers, it can be assumed that the treated group in the treatment condition consists of both always-takers and compliers. From the observations of the treated outcomes in the control group, the average treated outcome for always-takers can be extracted, as well as their share of the overall population. As such, the weighted average can be undone and the treated potential outcome for the compliers can be obtained; then, the LATE is subtracted to get the untreated potential outcomes for the compliers. This move will then allow extrapolation from the compliers to obtain the ATE.\n\nReturning to the weak monotonicity assumption, which assumes that the utility function always runs in one direction, the utility of a marginal complier would be similar to the utility of a never-taker on one end, and that of an always-taker on the other end. The always-takers will have the same untreated potential outcomes as the compliers, which is its maximum untreated potential outcome. Again, this is based on the underlying utility model linking the subgroups, which assumes that the utility function of an always-taker would not be lower than the utility function of a complier. The same logic would apply to the never-takers, who are assumed to have a utility function that will always be lower than that of a complier.\n\nGiven this, extrapolation is possible by projecting the untreated potential outcomes of the compliers to the always-takers, and the treated potential outcomes of the compliers to the never-takers. In other words, if it is assumed that the untreated compliers are informative about always-takers, and the treated compliers are informative about never-takers, then comparison is now possible among the treated always-takers to their \u201cas-if\u201d untreated always-takers, and the untreated never-takers can be compared to their \u201cas-if\u201d treated counterparts. This will then allow the calculation of the overall treatment effect. Extrapolation under the weak monotonicity assumption will provide a bound, rather than a point-estimate.\n\n=== Limitations ===\nThe estimation of the extrapolation to ATE from the LATE requires certain key assumptions, which may vary from one approach to another. While some may assume homogeneity within covariates, and thus extrapolate based on strata,<ref name=\":0b\" /> others may instead assume [[Monotonic function|monotonicity]].<ref name=\":1\" />&nbsp; All will assume the absence of defiers within the experimental population. Some of these assumptions may be weaker than others\u2014for example, the monotonicity assumption is weaker than the [[ignorability]] assumption. However, there are other trade-offs to consider, such as whether the estimates produced are point-estimates, or bounds. Ultimately, the literature on generalizing the LATE relies entirely on key assumptions. It is not a design-based approach per se, and the field of experiments is not usually in the habit of comparing groups unless they are randomly assigned. Even in case when assumptions are difficult to verify, researcher can incorporate through the foundation of experiment design. For example, in a typical field experiment where instrument is&nbsp; \u201cencouragement to treatment\u201d, treatment heterogeneity could be detected by varying intensity of encouragement. If the compliance rate remains stable under different intensity, if could be a signal of homogeneity across groups. Thus, it is important to be a smart consumer of this line of literature, and examine whether the key assumptions are going to be valid in each experimental case.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{Cite book|last=Angrist|first=Joshua D.|pages=401\u2013434|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781139060035|last2=Fern\u00e1ndez-Val|first2=Iv\u00e1n|doi=10.1017/cbo9781139060035.012|title=Advances in Economics and Econometrics|year=2013}}\n\n[[Category:Econometrics]]\n[[Category:Medical statistics]]\n", "text_old": "{{tone|date=December 2018}}\nThe '''local average treatment effect (LATE)''', also known as the complier average causal effect (CACE), was first introduced into the econometrics literature by [[Guido Imbens|Guido W.

It is not to be confused with the [[Average treatment effect|average treatment effect (ATE)]], which is the average subject-level treatment effect; the LATE is only the ATE among the compliers. The LATE can be estimated by a ratio of the estimated intent-to-treat effect and the estimated proportion of compliers, or alternatively through an [[Instrumental variables estimation|instrumental variable]] estimator. Since the LATE may not be equivalent to the ATE, we should be cautious of extrapolation.\n\n== General definition ==\nThe ATE is the difference between the expected value of the treatment group and the expected value of the control group. In an experimental setting, random assignment allows us to assume that the treatment group and control group have the same expected potential outcomes when treated (or untreated). This can be expressed as:\n\n<math>E[Y_i(1)|D_i=1]=E[Y_i(1)|D_i=0]=E[Y_i(1)] </math>\n\n<math>E[Y_i(0)|D_i=1]=E[Y_i(0)|D_i=0]=E[Y_i(0)]</math>\n\nIn an ideal experiment, all subjects assigned to treatment are treated, while those that are assigned to control will remain untreated. In reality, however, the compliance rate is never perfect, which prevents researchers from identifying the ATE. In such cases, estimating the LATE becomes the more feasible option. The LATE is the average treatment effect among a specific subset of the subjects, who in this case would be the compliers.\n\n== Potential outcome framework and notation ==\nLet  <math>  Y_i(d) </math> denotes the potential outcome of subject i, where d is the binary indicator of subject <math> i </math>\u2019s treatment status. <math> Y_i(1) </math> denotes the treated potential outcome for subject i, while <math>  Y_i(0) </math> denotes the untreated potential outcome.  The causal effect of the treatment on subject <math> i </math> is <math> Y_i(1)-Y_i(0) </math>.  However, we can never observe both  <math> Y_i(1) </math>and <math>  Y_i(0) </math> for the same subject. At any given time, we can only observe a subject in its treated <math> Y_i(1) </math> or untreated <math>  Y_i(0) </math> state.\n\nThrough random assignment, the expected untreated potential outcome of the control group is the same as that of the treatment group, and the expected treated potential outcome of treatment group is the same as that of the control group. The random assignment assumption thus allows us to take the difference between the average outcome in the treatment group and the average outcome in the control group as the overall average treatment effect, such that:\n\n<math>ATE= E[Y_i(1)-Y_i(0)]=E[Y_i(1)]-E[Y_i(0)]=E[Y_i(1)|D_i=1]-E[Y_i(0)|D_i=0] </math>\n\n=== Noncompliance framework ===\nQuite often will researchers encounter noncompliance problems in their experiments, whereby subjects fail to comply with their experimental assignments. Some subjects will not take the treatment when assigned to the treatment group, so their potential outcome of <math> Y_i(1) </math> will not be revealed, while some subjects assigned to the control group will take the treatment, so they will not reveal their <math> Y_i(0) </math>.\n\nGiven noncompliance, the population in an experiment can be divided into four subgroups: compliers, always-takers, never-takers and defiers. We then introduce <math>z</math> as a binary indicator of experimental assignment, such that when <math>z_i = 1</math>, subject <math>i</math> is assigned to treatment, and when <math>z_i=0</math>, subject <math> i </math> is assigned to control. Thus, <math>d_i(z)</math>represents whether subject <math> i </math> is actually treated or not when treatment assignment is <math>z_i</math>.\n\nCompliers are subjects who will take the treatment if and only if they were assigned to the treatment group, i.e. the subpopulation with  <math>d_i(1)=1</math> and <math>d_i(0)=0</math>.\n\nNoncompliers are composed of the three remaining subgroups:\n\n* Always-takers are subjects who will always take the treatment even if they were assigned to the control group, i.e. the subpopulation with <math>d_i(z)=1</math>\n* Never-takers are subjects who will never take the treatment even if they were assigned to the treatment group, i.e. the subpopulation with <math>d_i(z)=0</math>\n* Defiers are subjects who will do the opposite of their treatment assignment status, i.e. the subpopulation with <math>d_i(1)=0</math> and <math>d_i(0)=1\n</math>\n\nNon-compliance can take two forms. In the case of one-sided non-compliance, a number of the subjects who were assigned to the treatment group remain untreated. Subjects are thus divided into compliers and never-takers, such that <math>d_i(0) = 0</math>for all <math>i</math>, while <math>d_i(1)= </math>  0 or 1. In the case of two-sided non-compliance, a number of the subjects assigned to the treatment group fail to receive the treatment, while a number of the subjects assigned to the control group receive the treatment. In this case, subjects are divided into the four subgroups, such that both <math>d_i(0)</math> and <math>d_i(1)</math> can be 0 or 1.\n\nGiven non-compliance, we require certain assumptions to estimate the LATE.

In an experiment with perfect compliance, the average treatment effect can be obtained easily. However, many experiments are likely to experience either one-sided or two-sided non-compliance. In the presence of non-compliance, the ATE can no longer be recovered. Instead, what is recovered is the average treatment effect for a certain subpopulation known as the compliers, which is the LATE.\n\nWhen there may exist heterogeneous treatment effects across groups, the LATE is unlikely to be equivalent to the ATE.

The compliers are those who were induced by the draft lottery to serve in the military. If the research interest is on how to compensate those involuntarily taxed by the draft, LATE would be useful, since the research targets compliers.

Thus, to retrieve the ATE, it is necessary to reweight based on the information gleaned from compliers. There are a number of ways that reweighting can be used to try to get at the ATE from the LATE.\n\n==== Reweighting by ignorability assumption ====\nBy leveraging [[Instrumental variables estimation|instrumental variable]], Aronow and Carnegie (2013)<ref name=\":0b\" /> propose a new reweighting method called Inverse Compliance Score weighting (ICSW), with a similar intuition behind [[Inverse probability weighting|IPW]]. This method assumes compliance propensity is a pre-treatment covariate and compliers would have the same average treatment effect within their strata. ICSW first estimates the conditional probability of being a complier (Compliance Score) for each subject by [[Maximum likelihood estimation|Maximum Likelihood estimator]] given covariates control, then reweights each unit by its inverse of compliance score, so that compliers would have covariate distribution that matches the full population. ICSW is applicable at both [[Local Average Treatment Effect|one-sided]] and [[Local Average Treatment Effect|two-sided noncompliance]] situation.\n\nAlthough one's compliance score cannot be directly observed, the probability of compliance can be estimated by observing the compliance condition from the same strata,&nbsp; in other words those that share the same covariate profile. The compliance score is treated as a latent pretreatment covariate, which is independent of treatment assignment <math>Z</math>. For each unit <math>i</math>, compliance score is denoted as <math display=\"inline\">P_{Ci}=Pr(D_1>D_0|X=x_i)</math>, where <math>x_i</math>is the covariate vector for unit <math>i </math>.\n\nIn [[Local Average Treatment Effect|one-sided noncompliance]] case,&nbsp; the population consists of only compliers and never-takers. All units assigned to the treatment group that take the treatment will be compliers. Thus, a simple bivariate regression of D on X can predict the probability of compliance.\n\nIn [[Local Average Treatment Effect|two-sided noncompliance]] case, compliance score is estimated using [[maximum likelihood estimation]].\n\nBy assuming [[Probit model|probit distribution]] for compliance and of Bernoulli distribution of D,\n\nwhere&nbsp;<math>\\hat{\\Pr{c_i}}=\\hat{\\Pr}(D_1>D_0|X=x_i)=F(\\hat{\\theta}_{A,C,x_i})(1-F(\\hat{\\theta}_{A|A,C,x_i}))^3</math> .\n\nand&nbsp;<math>\\theta</math> is a vector of covariates to be estimated, <math>F(.)</math> is the cumulative distribution function for a [[probit model]]\n\n* ICSW estimator\n\nBy the LATE theorem,<ref name=\"Imbens 467\"/>&nbsp; [[Local Average Treatment Effect|average treatment effect for compliers]] can be estimated with equation:\n\n<math>\\tau_{LATE}=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n {Z_i}{Y_i}/\\sum_{i=1}^n {Z_i}-\\sum_{i=1}^n {(1-Z_i)}{Y_i}/\\sum_{i=1}^n {(1-Z_i)}}{\n    \\sum_{i=1}^n {Z_i}{D_i}/\\sum_{i=1}^n {Z_i}-\\sum_{i=1}^n {(1-Z_i)}{D_i}/\\sum_{i=1}^n {(1-Z_i)}}\n</math>\n\nDefine <math>\\hat{w_{Ci}}=1/\\hat{Pr_{Ci}}</math> the ICSW estimator&nbsp; &nbsp;is simply&nbsp; weighted by&nbsp; :\n\n<math>\\tau_{ATE}=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n \\hat{W_i}{Z_i}{Y_i}/\\sum_{i=1}^n \\hat{W_i}{Z_i}-\\sum_{i=1}^n \\hat{W_i}{(1-Z_i)}{Y_i}/\\sum_{i=1}^n {\\hat{W_i}(1-Z_i)}}{\n    \\sum_{i=1}^n \\hat{W_i}{Z_i}{D_i}/\\sum_{i=1}^n \\hat{W_i}{Z_i}-\\sum_{i=1}^n \\hat{W_i}{(1-Z_i)}{D_i}/\\sum_{i=1}^n \\hat{W_i}{(1-Z_i)}}\n</math>\n\nThis estimator is equivalent to using [[2SLS]] estimator with weight .\n\n* Core assumptions under reweighting\n\nAn essential assumption of ICSW relying on&nbsp; treatment homogeneity within strata, which means the treatment effect should on average be the same for everyone in the strata, not just for the compliers. If this assumption holds, LATE is equal to ATE within some covariate profile. Denote as:\n\n<math>\\text{for all }x \\in Supp(X), E[Y_1-Y_0|D_1>D_0]</math>\n\nNotice this is a less restrictive assumption than the traditional [[ignorability]] assumption, as this only concerns the covariate sets that are relevant to compliance score, which further leads to heterogeneity, without considering all sets of covariates.\n\nThe second assumption is consistency of&nbsp; <math>\\hat{Pr_{Ci}}</math>&nbsp;for <math>Pr_{Ci}</math>&nbsp;and the third assumption is the nonzero compliance for each strata, which is an extension of IV assumption of nonzero compliance over population. This is a reasonable assumption as if compliance score is zero for certain strata, the inverse of it would be infinite.\n\nICSW estimator is more sensible than that of IV estimator, as it incorporate more covariate information, such that the estimator might have higher variances. This is a general problem for IPW-style estimation. The problem is exaggerated when there is only a small population in certain strata and compliance rate is low.&nbsp; One way to compromise it to winsorize the estimates, in this paper they set the threshold as =0.275. If compliance score for lower than 0.275, it is replaced by this value. Bootstrap is also recommended in the entire process to reduce uncertainty(Abadie 2002).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Abadie|first=Alberto|date=March 2002|title=Bootstrap Tests for Distributional Treatment Effects in Instrumental Variable Models|journal=Journal of the American Statistical Association|volume=97|issue=457|pages=284\u2013292|doi=10.1198/016214502753479419|issn=0162-1459|citeseerx=10.1.1.337.3129}}</ref>\n\n==== Reweighting under monotonicity assumption ====\n{{more citations needed|section|date=December 2018}}\nIn another approach, one might assume that an underlying utility model links the never-takers, compliers, and always-takers. The ATE can be estimated by reweighting based on an extrapolation of the complier treated and untreated potential outcomes to the never-takers and always-takers. The following method is one that has been proposed by Amanda Kowalski.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nFirst, all subjects are assumed to have a utility function, determined by their individual gains from treatment and costs from treatment. Based on an underlying assumption of monotonicity, the never-takers, compliers, and always-takers can be arranged on the same continuum based on their utility function. This assumes that the always-takers have such a high utility from taking the treatment that they will take it even without encouragement. On the other hand, the never-takers have such a low utility function that they will not take the treatment despite encouragement. Thus, the never-takers can be aligned with the compliers with the lowest utilities, and the always-takers with the compliers with the highest utility functions.\n\nIn an experimental population, several aspects can be observed: the treated potential outcomes of the always-takers (those who are treated in the control group); the untreated potential outcomes of the never-takers (those who remain untreated in the treatment group); the treated potential outcomes of the always-takers and compliers (those who are treated in the treatment group); and the untreated potential outcomes of the compliers and never-takers (those who are untreated in the control group). However, the treated and untreated potential outcomes of the compliers should be extracted from the latter two observations. To do so, the LATE must be extracted from the treated population.\n\nAssuming no defiers, it can be assumed that the treated group in the treatment condition consists of both always-takers and compliers. From the observations of the treated outcomes in the control group, the average treated outcome for always-takers can be extracted, as well as their share of the overall population. As such, the weighted average can be undone and the treated potential outcome for the compliers can be obtained; then, the LATE is subtracted to get the untreated potential outcomes for the compliers. This move will then allow extrapolation from the compliers to obtain the ATE.\n\nReturning to the weak monotonicity assumption, which assumes that the utility function always runs in one direction, the utility of a marginal complier would be similar to the utility of a never-taker on one end, and that of an always-taker on the other end. The always-takers will have the same untreated potential outcomes as the compliers, which is its maximum untreated potential outcome. Again, this is based on the underlying utility model linking the subgroups, which assumes that the utility function of an always-taker would not be lower than the utility function of a complier. The same logic would apply to the never-takers, who are assumed to have a utility function that will always be lower than that of a complier.\n\nGiven this, extrapolation is possible by projecting the untreated potential outcomes of the compliers to the always-takers, and the treated potential outcomes of the compliers to the never-takers. In other words, if it is assumed that the untreated compliers are informative about always-takers, and the treated compliers are informative about never-takers, then comparison is now possible among the treated always-takers to their \u201cas-if\u201d untreated always-takers, and the untreated never-takers can be compared to their \u201cas-if\u201d treated counterparts. This will then allow the calculation of the overall treatment effect. Extrapolation under the weak monotonicity assumption will provide a bound, rather than a point-estimate.\n\n=== Limitations ===\nThe estimation of the extrapolation to ATE from the LATE requires certain key assumptions, which may vary from one approach to another. While some may assume homogeneity within covariates, and thus extrapolate based on strata,<ref name=\":0b\" /> others may instead assume [[Monotonic function|monotonicity]].<ref name=\":1\" />&nbsp; All will assume the absence of defiers within the experimental population. Some of these assumptions may be weaker than others\u2014for example, the monotonicity assumption is weaker than the [[ignorability]] assumption. However, there are other trade-offs to consider, such as whether the estimates produced are point-estimates, or bounds. Ultimately, the literature on generalizing the LATE relies entirely on key assumptions. It is not a design-based approach per se, and the field of experiments is not usually in the habit of comparing groups unless they are randomly assigned. Even in case when assumptions are difficult to verify, researcher can incorporate through the foundation of experiment design. For example, in a typical field experiment where instrument is&nbsp; \u201cencouragement to treatment\u201d, treatment heterogeneity could be detected by varying intensity of encouragement.

He became [[Chief Baron of the Exchequer (Ireland)|Chief Baron of the Exchequer]] on 27 December 1703, holding the office until his death. His elevation to the Bench was said to be part of an effort to remove judges  who were suspected of [[Tory]] or pro-Catholic views; but it is   surprising that Donnellan, who was a descendant of an Old Irish, [[Irish language|Gaelic]]-speaking family which had several  [[Roman Catholic]] members, was not suspected of   Catholic and Tory sympathies himself.\n\nIn 1698 the Irish born writer and publisher [[John Dunton]], on a visit to Dublin, gave a favourable verdict on the Irish judiciary, including Donnellan: \"men whose reputation is such that no one complains of them\".\n\n==Family==\n\nHe married twice; little is known of his first wife, who died before 1688, leaving one surviving son, James. He remarried Martha Ussher, daughter of Christopher Ussher, who outlived him by many years, and married secondly Phillip Perceval, brother of the 1st [[Earl of Egmont]]. Nehemiah and Martha had two sons, Nehemiah, MP for [[Tipperary (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Tipperary]], and Christopher, and two daughters, Katherine and [[Anne Donnellan|Anne]] (died 1762).\n\nHis daughter Anne is remembered today as the friend of the leading Irish writers of her time, and for founding the Donnellan Lectures at Trinity College Dublin. \n\nHer sister Katherine married [[Robert Clayton (bishop)|Robert Clayton]], [[Bishop of Cork and Ross]].
