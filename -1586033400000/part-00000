Recent speeds range between 10 Mbit/s and 1000 Mbit/s for household targeted plans, and the data traffic is unmetered.\n\nHowever, the most popular broadband services are provided by micro-ISPs (known locally as \"''re\u0163ea de bloc/re\u0163ea de cartier''\" (Block/Neighborhood Networks)) with 50 to 3000 customers each. These ISPs usually provide their services through [[100BASE-T]] [[Unshielded twisted pair|UTP]] LANs, with a number of particularities and peculiarities: most were grassroot organizations and still have a feeling of community between subscribers and the management, speeds are usually divided in three categories: \"LAN\", \"Metropolitan\" and \"International\" with Metropolitan meaning a limited number of networks with which the micro-ISP has a peering agreement and sometimes the cable internet providers. Generally, for such broadband connections, speeds are 1000 Mbit/s locally, 1-100 Mbit/s metro and 256-2048 kbit/s International. Some of these micro-ISP function completely legally, while others (generally the smaller ones) are organized informally in something like a permanent [[LAN party]]. Many of these micro-ISPs formed organizations to represent their common interests and provide for integration of services (one such organization is [[Interlan]], covering the whole of [[Bucharest]]). Speeds, uptime, quality of service are generally not guaranteed, and while the biggest networks offer high quality connections and  / 30 Mbit/s upload international technical support, for the smallest ones, there is even the risk of [[network cards]] burning because of lightning strikes and badly insulated network infrastructure.\n\nFor business use, services are usually provided through fiber optics or less often, radio. Companies providing such services are providing very flexible and negotiable plans also based on the Metropolitan/International distinction. Usually prices and bandwidths are fully negotiable, with the micro-ISPs discussed above being influential resellers. There is very strong competition, with no peering between many such companies (again requiring a lot of traffic to be routed through international routes) and not even access to another's fiber-optics infrastructure (leading to the existence, in some cases, of over 25 fiber optics cables on the same street, hanging from the same pole).

Since April 2014 their offer was updated to include subscriptions for 4G.Since September 2014 they introduced 4G+ with speeds up to 300 Mbit/s.\n\n[[Vodafone Romania]] also uses 3G/3G+ technologies, with speeds of up to 43.2 Mbit/s in big cities and up to 21.6 Mbit/s nationwide (on 900 and 2100&nbsp;MHz frequencies). In 2012 they were the first operator to offer 4G subscriptions with the speeds gradually increased from 75 to 150 Mbit/s. On 8 September 2014, Vodafone announced its new technology: Supernet 4G - more often known as 4G+, which promises internet speeds of 300 Mbit/s using the mobile network. According to OpenSignal report on 24 September 2015, Vodafone Romania is the fastest internet provider of LTE services in Europe with an average 36 Mbit/s for download.\n\n[[RCS&RDS]] provides 3G internet with speeds of up to 21.6 Mbit/s in the main cities and up to 7.2 Mbit/s on the main roads (on 900 and 2100&nbsp;MHz frequencies). Wired internet subscribers with superior plans also receive a free 3G internet dongle and service. Since Jun 2014 an agreement with [[Vodafone]] allows the users of [[RCS&RDS]] services to do national roaming for both voice and data, using the infrastructure of Vodafone in places were [[RCS&RDS]] does not have coverage. On 20 August 2015, RCS&RDS announced that they acquired a LTE license that was previously owned by 2K Telekom Romania SRL. With no specific launched date, Digi.Mobil (the brand under witch RCS&RDS operates) promised that its 4G services will be available in the biggest 25 cities across the country until the end of the year, with the first 12 cities access in September.

Recent speeds range between 10 Mbit/s and 1000 Mbit/s for household targeted plans, and the data traffic is unmetered.\n\nHowever, the most popular broadband services are provided by micro-ISPs (known locally as \"''re\u0163ea de bloc/re\u0163ea de cartier''\" (Block/Neighborhood Networks)) with 50 to 3000 customers each. These ISPs usually provide their services through [[100BASE-T]] [[Unshielded twisted pair|UTP]] LANs, with a number of particularities and peculiarities: most were grassroot organizations and still have a feeling of community between subscribers and the management, speeds are usually divided in three categories: \"LAN\", \"Metropolitan\" and \"International\" with Metropolitan meaning a limited number of networks with which the micro-ISP has a peering agreement and sometimes the cable internet providers. Generally, for such broadband connections, speeds are 1000 Mbit/s locally, 1-100 Mbit/s metro and 256-2048 kbit/s International. Some of these micro-ISP function completely legally, while others (generally the smaller ones) are organized informally in something like a permanent [[LAN party]]. Many of these micro-ISPs formed organizations to represent their common interests and provide for integration of services (one such organization is [[Interlan]], covering the whole of [[Bucharest]]). Speeds, uptime, quality of service are generally not guaranteed, and while the biggest networks offer high quality connections and  / 30 Mbit/s upload international technical support, for the smallest ones, there is even the risk of [[network cards]] burning because of lightning strikes and badly insulated network infrastructure.\n\nFor business use, services are usually provided through fiber optics or less often, radio. Companies providing such services are providing very flexible and negotiable plans also based on the Metropolitan/International distinction. Usually prices and bandwidths are fully negotiable, with the micro-ISPs discussed above being influential resellers. There is very strong competition, with no peering between many such companies (again requiring a lot of traffic to be routed through international routes) and not even access to another's fiber-optics infrastructure (leading to the existence, in some cases, of over 25 fiber optics cables on the same street, hanging from the same pole). As such many companies have two separate providers for basically the same services.\n\nDSL has been an option since late 90's but is a less popular choice compared to the other offers because it is slightly more expensive.

They were runners-up in the first three instalments of the Nations Cup ([[Oceania Nations Cup 1973|1973]], [[Oceania Nations Cup 1980|1980]] and [[Oceania Nations Cup 1996|1996]]). The nation went through a period of less success, but showed promise when it qualified for the [[2009 FIFA U-20 World Cup]] in Egypt. This success was followed up with the title of [[2012 OFC Nations Cup]], becoming the first team other than [[Australia national soccer team|Australia]] and [[New Zealand national football team|New Zealand]] to win the competition.\n\n==History==\nTahiti played its first full match on 21 September 1952, at home against [[New Zealand national football team|New Zealand]], drawing 2\u20132. Seven days later, the two teams played again and New Zealand won 5\u20133. On 30 September, they played each other for a third time, and Tahiti gained its first victory, by 2\u20130. However, it is unknown whether this was a full international match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rsssf.com/tablest/tahiti-intres.html |title=Tahiti International Matches |website=Rsssf.com |date= |accessdate=23 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn September 1953, Tahiti played three matches in [[New Caledonia]] against [[New Caledonia national football team|its national side]], losing the first 5\u20130 and the later two 4\u20131. They then travelled to the New Hebrides (now [[Vanuatu]]) and beat [[Vanuatu national football team|its national side]] 4\u20132 twice. In 1989, under the leadership of Napoleon Spitz, the official federation was created.\n\nTahiti entered its first World Cup qualification with the aim of reaching the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]], held in the United States. They were placed in [[1994 FIFA World Cup qualification (OFC)#Group A|Group A]] alongside [[Australia national soccer team|Australia]] and the [[Solomon Islands national football team|Solomon Islands]], and played their first match away to the Solomon Islands in [[Honiara]] on 11 July 1992. Eric Etaeta equalised for Tahiti to make it 1\u20131 in the 76th minute. On 11 September, Tahiti hosted Australia in [[Papeete]] and lost 3\u20130.

The team consists of a selection of players from French Polynesia, not just [[Tahiti]], and has competed in the [[Oceania Football Confederation]] (OFC) since 1990.\n\nTahiti is traditionally one of the stronger footballing nations of the [[Pacific Islands]], with the second-best record at the [[football at the South Pacific Games|football section of the South Pacific Games]], with five victories. They were runners-up in the first three instalments of the Nations Cup ([[Oceania Nations Cup 1973|1973]], [[Oceania Nations Cup 1980|1980]] and [[Oceania Nations Cup 1996|1996]]). The nation went through a period of less success, but showed promise when it qualified for the [[2009 FIFA U-20 World Cup]] in Egypt. This success was followed up with the title of [[2012 OFC Nations Cup]], becoming the first team other than [[Australia national soccer team|Australia]] and [[New Zealand national football team|New Zealand]] to win the competition.\n\n==History==\nTahiti played its first full match on 21 September 1952, at home against [[New Zealand national football team|New Zealand]], drawing 2\u20132. Seven days later, the two teams played again and New Zealand won 5\u20133. On 30 September, they played each other for a third time, and Tahiti gained its first victory, by 2\u20130. However, it is unknown whether this was a full international match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rsssf.com/tablest/tahiti-intres.html |title=Tahiti International Matches |website=Rsssf.com |date= |accessdate=23 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn September 1953, Tahiti played three matches in [[New Caledonia]] against [[New Caledonia national football team|its national side]], losing the first 5\u20130 and the later two 4\u20131. They then travelled to the New Hebrides (now [[Vanuatu]]) and beat [[Vanuatu national football team|its national side]] 4\u20132 twice. In 1989, under the leadership of Napoleon Spitz, the official federation was created.\n\nTahiti entered its first World Cup qualification with the aim of reaching the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]], held in the United States. They were placed in [[1994 FIFA World Cup qualification (OFC)#Group A|Group A]] alongside [[Australia national soccer team|Australia]] and the [[Solomon Islands national football team|Solomon Islands]], and played their first match away to the Solomon Islands in [[Honiara]] on 11 July 1992. Eric Etaeta equalised for Tahiti to make it 1\u20131 in the 76th minute. On 11 September, Tahiti hosted Australia in [[Papeete]] and lost 3\u20130. The next fixture was again against Australia, and resulted in a 2\u20130 away defeat in [[Brisbane]] on 20 September. On 9 October, in Papeete, Tahiti defeated the Solomon Islands 4\u20132.

Copenhagen is situated on the eastern coast of the island of [[Zealand]]; another small portion of the city is located on [[Amager]], and it is separated from [[Malm\u00f6]], Sweden, by the strait of [[\u00d8resund]]. The [[\u00d8resund Bridge]] connects the two cities by rail and road.\n\nOriginally a [[Vikings|Viking]] fishing village established in the 10th century in the vicinity of what is now [[Gammel Strand]], Copenhagen became the capital of Denmark in the early 15th century. Beginning in the 17th century it consolidated its position as a regional centre of power with its institutions, defences and armed forces. During the renaissance the city served as the de facto capital being the seat of government of the [[Kalmar Union]], governing the entire present day [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] region in a personal union with Sweden and [[Norway]] ruled by the Danish monarch serving as the head of state. The city flourished as the cultural and economic center of [[Scandinavia]] under the union for well over 120 years, starting in the 15th century up until the beginning of the 16th century when the union was dissolved with Sweden leaving the union through a rebellion. After [[Great Northern War plague outbreak|a plague outbreak]] and fire in the 18th century, the city underwent a period of redevelopment. This included construction of the prestigious district of [[Frederiksstaden]] and founding of such cultural institutions as the [[Royal Danish Theatre|Royal Theatre]] and the [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts|Royal Academy of Fine Arts]]. After further disasters in the early 19th century when [[Horatio Nelson]] attacked the Dano-Norwegian fleet and bombarded the city, rebuilding during the [[Danish Golden Age]] brought a [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] look to Copenhagen's architecture. Later, following the [[Second World War]], the [[Finger Plan]] fostered the development of housing and businesses along the five urban railway routes stretching out from the city centre.\n\nSince the turn of the 21st century, Copenhagen has seen strong urban and cultural development, facilitated by investment in its institutions and infrastructure. The city is the [[Culture of Denmark|cultural]], [[Economy of Denmark|economic]] and [[Politics of Denmark|governmental]] centre of Denmark; it is one of the major financial centres of Northern Europe with the [[Copenhagen Stock Exchange]]. Copenhagen's economy has seen rapid developments in the [[service sector]], especially through initiatives in information technology, [[pharmaceuticals]] and [[clean technology]]. Since the completion of the [[\u00d8resund Bridge]], Copenhagen has become increasingly integrated with the Swedish province of [[Scania]] and its largest city, Malm\u00f6, forming the [[\u00d8resund Region]]. With a number of bridges connecting the various districts, the cityscape is characterised by parks, promenades and waterfronts. Copenhagen's landmarks such as [[Tivoli Gardens]], ''[[The Little Mermaid (statue)|The Little Mermaid]]'' statue, the [[Amalienborg]] and [[Christiansborg Palace|Christiansborg]] palaces, [[Rosenborg Castle Gardens]], [[Frederik's Church]], and many museums, restaurants and nightclubs are significant tourist attractions. The largest lake of Denmark, [[Arres\u00f8]], lies around 27 miles (43 kilometers) northwest of the [[City Hall Square, Copenhagen|City Hall Square]].\n\nCopenhagen is home to the [[University of Copenhagen]], the [[Technical University of Denmark]], [[Copenhagen Business School]] and the [[IT University of Copenhagen]]. The University of Copenhagen, founded in 1479, is the oldest university in Denmark. Copenhagen is home to the [[F.C. Copenhagen|FC K\u00f8benhavn]] and [[Br\u00f8ndby IF|Br\u00f8ndby]] football clubs. The annual [[Copenhagen Marathon]] was established in 1980. Copenhagen is one of the most bicycle-friendly cities in the world.\n\nThe [[Copenhagen Metro]] launched in 2002 serves central Copenhagen. Additionally the [[S-train (Copenhagen)|Copenhagen S-train]], the [[Lokaltog]] ([[:da:Privatbane|private railway]]) and the [[Coast Line (Denmark)|Coast Line]] network serves and connects central Copenhagen to outlying boroughs. Serving roughly two million passengers a month, [[Copenhagen Airport]], Kastrup, is the busiest airport in the [[Nordic countries]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Etymology==\nCopenhagen's name reflects its origin as a harbour and a place of commerce. The original designation in [[Old Norse]], from which Danish descends, was '''Kaupmannah\u01ebfn''' [\u02e1kaupman\u02d0ah\u0252vn] (cf. modern [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]: ''Kaupmannah\u00f6fn'' [\u02e1k\u02b0\u00f8yhpman\u02d0ah\u0153pn], [[Faroese language|Faroese]] ''Keypmannahavn''), meaning \"merchants' harbour\". By the time [[Old Danish]] was spoken, the capital was called '''K\u00f8pmann\u00e6hafn''', with the current name deriving from centuries of subsequent regular [[sound change]]. An exact English equivalent would be \"[[Chapmen|chapman]]'s [[Harbor|haven]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eremit.dk/ebog/khb/1/khb1_2.html|first=Oluf|last=Nielsen|title=Kj\u00f8benhavn i Middelalderen|publisher=G.E.C. Gad|year=1877|accessdate=23 November 2013 |language=Danish}}</ref> However, the English term for the city was adapted from its [[Low German]] name, ''Kopenhagen''.\n(English ''chapman'', German ''Kaufmann'', Dutch ''koopman'', Swedish ''k\u00f6pman'', Danish ''k\u00f8bmand'', Icelandic ''kaupma\u00f0ur'': in all these words, the first syllable comes ultimately from Latin ''caupo'', \"tradesman\".) Copenhagen's Swedish name is ''K\u00f6penhamn'', a direct translation of the mutually intelligible Danish name.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Copenhagen|Timeline of Copenhagen}}\n[[File:K\u00f8benhavn1500.jpg|right|thumb|Reconstruction of Copenhagen {{circa|1500}}]]\n\n===Early history===\nAlthough the earliest historical records of Copenhagen are from the end of the 12th century, recent [[archaeological]] finds in connection with work on the city's metropolitan rail system revealed the remains of a large merchant's mansion near today's [[Kongens Nytorv]] from c. 1020. Excavations in [[Pilestr\u00e6de]] have also led to the discovery of a well from the late 12th century. The remains of an ancient church, with graves dating to the 11th century, have been unearthed near where [[Str\u00f8get]] meets [[R\u00e5dhuspladsen]].\n\nThese finds indicate that Copenhagen's origins as a city go back at least to the 11th century. Substantial discoveries of [[flint]] tools in the area provide evidence of human settlements dating to the [[Stone Age]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://videnskab.dk/kultur-samfund/arkaeologer-graver-ny-teori-om-kobenhavn-op-af-mulden|title=Ark\u00e6ologer graver ny teori om K\u00f8benhavn op af mulden|publisher=Videnskab.dk|date=5 November 2008|accessdate=12 November 2013|language=Danish}}</ref> Many historians believe the town dates to the late [[Viking Age]], and was possibly founded by [[Sweyn Forkbeard|Sweyn I Forkbeard]].{{sfn|Cunningham|2013|p=35}} \nThe natural harbour and good [[herring]] stocks seem to have attracted fishermen and merchants to the area on a seasonal basis from the 11th century and more permanently in the 13th century.<ref name=khdsd>{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/K%c3%b8benhavn/K%c3%b8benhavn/K%c3%b8benhavn_-_historie|title=K\u00f8benhavn \u2013 historie|website=Den Store Danske |access-date=12 November 2013 |language=Danish}}</ref> The first habitations were probably centred on [[Gammel Strand]] (literally \"old shore\") in the 11th century or even earlier.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.copenhagen.dk/dk/kulturmiljo/historier_om_kbenhavn/gammel_strand1/|title=Gammel Strand|publisher=K\u00f8benhavns Museum|accessdate=24 November 2013|language=Danish|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20131124104344/http://www.copenhagen.dk/dk/kulturmiljo/historier_om_kbenhavn/gammel_strand1/|archivedate=24 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe earliest written mention of the town was in the 12th century when [[Saxo Grammaticus]] in [[Gesta Danorum]] referred to it as ''Portus Mercatorum'', meaning Merchants' Harbour or, in the [[Danish language|Danish]] of the time, ''K\u00f8bmannahavn''.<ref name=metro1415>Skaarup; Jensen (2002), pp. 14\u201315</ref> Traditionally, Copenhagen's founding has been dated to [[Absalon|Bishop Absalon]]'s construction of a modest fortress on the little island of [[Slotsholmen]] in 1167 where [[Christiansborg Palace]] stands today.{{sfn|Davies|1944|p=365}} The construction of the fortress was in response to attacks by [[Wends|Wendish]] pirates who plagued the coastline during the 12th century.{{sfn|Harding|2009|p=38}} Defensive ramparts and moats were completed and by 1177 St. Clemens Church had been built.

Copenhagen's defences were reinforced with a series of towers along the city wall. After an extended siege from July 1535 to July 1536, during which the city supported Christian II's alliance with [[Malm\u00f6]] and [[L\u00fcbeck]], it was finally forced to capitulate to [[Christian III of Denmark|Christian III]]. During the second half of the century, the city prospered from increased trade across the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] supported by Dutch shipping. [[Christoffer Valkendorff]], a high-ranking statesman, defended the city's interests and contributed to its development.<ref name=khdsd/> The Netherlands had also become primarily Protestant, as were northern German states.\n\nDuring the reign of [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]] between 1588 and 1648, Copenhagen had dramatic growth as a city. On his initiative at the beginning of the 17th century, two important buildings were completed on [[Slotsholmen]]: the [[T\u00f8jhus Museum|T\u00f8jhus Arsenal]] and [[B\u00f8rsen]], the stock exchange. To foster international trade, the [[Danish East India Company|East India Company]] was founded in 1616. To the east of the city, inspired by Dutch planning, the king developed the district of [[Christianshavn]] with canals and ramparts.

Copenhagen is situated on the eastern coast of the island of [[Zealand]]; another small portion of the city is located on [[Amager]], and it is separated from [[Malm\u00f6]], Sweden, by the strait of [[\u00d8resund]]. The [[\u00d8resund Bridge]] connects the two cities by rail and road.\n\nOriginally a [[Vikings|Viking]] fishing village established in the 10th century in the vicinity of what is now [[Gammel Strand]], Copenhagen became the capital of Denmark in the early 15th century. Beginning in the 17th century it consolidated its position as a regional centre of power with its institutions, defences and armed forces. During the renaissance the city served as the de facto capital being the seat of government of the [[Kalmar Union]], governing the entire present day [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] region in a personal union with Sweden and [[Norway]] ruled by the Danish monarch serving as the head of state. The city flourished as the cultural and economic center of [[Scandinavia]] under the union for well over 120 years, starting in the 15th century up until the beginning of the 16th century when the union was dissolved with Sweden leaving the union through a rebellion. After [[Great Northern War plague outbreak|a plague outbreak]] and fire in the 18th century, the city underwent a period of redevelopment. This included construction of the prestigious district of [[Frederiksstaden]] and founding of such cultural institutions as the [[Royal Danish Theatre|Royal Theatre]] and the [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts|Royal Academy of Fine Arts]]. After further disasters in the early 19th century when [[Horatio Nelson]] attacked the Dano-Norwegian fleet and bombarded the city, rebuilding during the [[Danish Golden Age]] brought a [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] look to Copenhagen's architecture. Later, following the [[Second World War]], the [[Finger Plan]] fostered the development of housing and businesses along the five urban railway routes stretching out from the city centre.\n\nSince the turn of the 21st century, Copenhagen has seen strong urban and cultural development, facilitated by investment in its institutions and infrastructure. The city is the [[Culture of Denmark|cultural]], [[Economy of Denmark|economic]] and [[Politics of Denmark|governmental]] centre of Denmark; it is one of the major financial centres of Northern Europe with the [[Copenhagen Stock Exchange]]. Copenhagen's economy has seen rapid developments in the [[service sector]], especially through initiatives in information technology, [[pharmaceuticals]] and [[clean technology]]. Since the completion of the [[\u00d8resund Bridge]], Copenhagen has become increasingly integrated with the Swedish province of [[Scania]] and its largest city, Malm\u00f6, forming the [[\u00d8resund Region]]. With a number of bridges connecting the various districts, the cityscape is characterised by parks, promenades and waterfronts. Copenhagen's landmarks such as [[Tivoli Gardens]], ''[[The Little Mermaid (statue)|The Little Mermaid]]'' statue, the [[Amalienborg]] and [[Christiansborg Palace|Christiansborg]] palaces, [[Rosenborg Castle Gardens]], [[Frederik's Church]], and many museums, restaurants and nightclubs are significant tourist attractions. The largest lake of Denmark, [[Arres\u00f8]], lies around 27 miles (43 kilometers) northwest of the [[City Hall Square, Copenhagen|City Hall Square]].\n\nCopenhagen is home to the [[University of Copenhagen]], the [[Technical University of Denmark]], [[Copenhagen Business School]] and the [[IT University of Copenhagen]]. The University of Copenhagen, founded in 1479, is the oldest university in Denmark. Copenhagen is home to the [[F.C. Copenhagen|FC K\u00f8benhavn]] and [[Br\u00f8ndby IF|Br\u00f8ndby]] football clubs. The annual [[Copenhagen Marathon]] was established in 1980. Copenhagen is one of the most bicycle-friendly cities in the world.\n\nThe [[Copenhagen Metro]] launched in 2002 serves central Copenhagen. Additionally the [[S-train (Copenhagen)|Copenhagen S-train]], the [[Lokaltog]] ([[:da:Privatbane|private railway]]) and the [[Coast Line (Denmark)|Coast Line]] network serves and connects central Copenhagen to outlying boroughs. Serving roughly two million passengers a month, [[Copenhagen Airport]], Kastrup, is the busiest airport in the [[Nordic countries]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Etymology==\nCopenhagen's name reflects its origin as a harbour and a place of commerce. The original designation in [[Old Norse]], from which Danish descends, was '''Kaupmannah\u01ebfn''' [\u02e1kaupman\u02d0ah\u0252vn] (cf. modern [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]: ''Kaupmannah\u00f6fn'' [\u02e1k\u02b0\u00f8yhpman\u02d0ah\u0153pn], [[Faroese language|Faroese]] ''Keypmannahavn''), meaning \"merchants' harbour\". By the time [[Old Danish]] was spoken, the capital was called '''K\u00f8pmann\u00e6hafn''', with the current name deriving from centuries of subsequent regular [[sound change]]. An exact English equivalent would be \"[[Chapmen|chapman]]'s [[Harbor|haven]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eremit.dk/ebog/khb/1/khb1_2.html|first=Oluf|last=Nielsen|title=Kj\u00f8benhavn i Middelalderen|publisher=G.E.C. Gad|year=1877|accessdate=23 November 2013 |language=Danish}}</ref> However, the English term for the city was adapted from its [[Low German]] name, ''Kopenhagen''.\n(English ''chapman'', German ''Kaufmann'', Dutch ''koopman'', Swedish ''k\u00f6pman'', Danish ''k\u00f8bmand'', Icelandic ''kaupma\u00f0ur'': in all these words, the first syllable comes ultimately from Latin ''caupo'', \"tradesman\".) Copenhagen's Swedish name is ''K\u00f6penhamn'', a direct translation of the mutually intelligible Danish name.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Copenhagen|Timeline of Copenhagen}}\n[[File:K\u00f8benhavn1500.jpg|right|thumb|Reconstruction of Copenhagen {{circa|1500}}]]\n\n===Early history===\nAlthough the earliest historical records of Copenhagen are from the end of the 12th century, recent [[archaeological]] finds in connection with work on the city's metropolitan rail system revealed the remains of a large merchant's mansion near today's [[Kongens Nytorv]] from c. 1020. Excavations in [[Pilestr\u00e6de]] have also led to the discovery of a well from the late 12th century. The remains of an ancient church, with graves dating to the 11th century, have been unearthed near where [[Str\u00f8get]] meets [[R\u00e5dhuspladsen]].\n\nThese finds indicate that Copenhagen's origins as a city go back at least to the 11th century. Substantial discoveries of [[flint]] tools in the area provide evidence of human settlements dating to the [[Stone Age]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://videnskab.dk/kultur-samfund/arkaeologer-graver-ny-teori-om-kobenhavn-op-af-mulden|title=Ark\u00e6ologer graver ny teori om K\u00f8benhavn op af mulden|publisher=Videnskab.dk|date=5 November 2008|accessdate=12 November 2013|language=Danish}}</ref> Many historians believe the town dates to the late [[Viking Age]], and was possibly founded by [[Sweyn Forkbeard|Sweyn I Forkbeard]].{{sfn|Cunningham|2013|p=35}} \nThe natural harbour and good [[herring]] stocks seem to have attracted fishermen and merchants to the area on a seasonal basis from the 11th century and more permanently in the 13th century.<ref name=khdsd>{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/K%c3%b8benhavn/K%c3%b8benhavn/K%c3%b8benhavn_-_historie|title=K\u00f8benhavn \u2013 historie|website=Den Store Danske |access-date=12 November 2013 |language=Danish}}</ref> The first habitations were probably centred on [[Gammel Strand]] (literally \"old shore\") in the 11th century or even earlier.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.copenhagen.dk/dk/kulturmiljo/historier_om_kbenhavn/gammel_strand1/|title=Gammel Strand|publisher=K\u00f8benhavns Museum|accessdate=24 November 2013|language=Danish|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20131124104344/http://www.copenhagen.dk/dk/kulturmiljo/historier_om_kbenhavn/gammel_strand1/|archivedate=24 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe earliest written mention of the town was in the 12th century when [[Saxo Grammaticus]] in [[Gesta Danorum]] referred to it as ''Portus Mercatorum'', meaning Merchants' Harbour or, in the [[Danish language|Danish]] of the time, ''K\u00f8bmannahavn''.<ref name=metro1415>Skaarup; Jensen (2002), pp. 14\u201315</ref> Traditionally, Copenhagen's founding has been dated to [[Absalon|Bishop Absalon]]'s construction of a modest fortress on the little island of [[Slotsholmen]] in 1167 where [[Christiansborg Palace]] stands today.{{sfn|Davies|1944|p=365}} The construction of the fortress was in response to attacks by [[Wends|Wendish]] pirates who plagued the coastline during the 12th century.{{sfn|Harding|2009|p=38}} Defensive ramparts and moats were completed and by 1177 St. Clemens Church had been built.

Copenhagen's defences were reinforced with a series of towers along the city wall. After an extended siege from July 1535 to July 1536, during which the city supported Christian II's alliance with [[Malm\u00f6]] and [[L\u00fcbeck]], it was finally forced to capitulate to [[Christian III of Denmark|Christian III]].
