Areas that correspond to present day Maharashtra were under direct or indirect British rule, first under the [[East India Trading Company]], and then under the [[British crown|British Raj]] from 1858. During this era Marathi people resided in the [[Bombay presidency]], [[Berar Province|Berar]], [[Central Provinces|Central provinces]], [[Hyderabad state]] and in various [[princely states]] that are currently part of present-day Maharashtra. Significant Marathi populations also resided in Maratha princely states far from Maharashtra such as [[Baroda State|Baroda]], [[Gwalior State|Gwalior]], [[Indore State|Indore]], and [[Tanjore]].\n\nThe [[British Raj|British colonial period]] saw standardisation of Marathi grammar through the efforts of the Christian missionary [[William Carey (missionary)|William Carey]].Carey also published the first dictionary of Marathi in [[Devanagari]] script. The most comprehensive Marathi-English dictionary was compiled by Captain [[James Thomas Molesworth]] and Major [[Thomas Candy]] in 1831.

Other ceremonies for different occasions in Hindu life include ''Vastushanti'' and \"Satyanarayan\" which is performed before a family formally establishes residence in a new house. [[Satyanarayana Puja]] is a ceremony performed before commencing any new endeavour or for no particular reason. Invoking the name of the family's [[gotra]] and the ''kuladaivat'' are important aspects of these ceremonies for many communities. \n[[File:Khandoba in a household shrine.JPG|right|thumb|A Marathi household shrine with [[Khandoba]] at the forefront]]\nLike most other Hindu communities, the Marathi people have a household shrine called a ''devaghar'' with idols, symbols, and pictures of various deities for daily worship. Ritual reading of religious texts known as ''[[Palm-leaf manuscript|pothi]]'' is also popular in some communities.\n\nIn some traditional families, food is first offered to the preferred deity in the household shrine, as ''[[naivedya]]'', before being consumed by family members and guests. Meals or snacks are not taken before this religious offering. In present times, the ''naivedya'' is offered by families only on days of special religious significance.\n\nMany Marathi people trace their paternal ancestors to one of the seven or eight sages, the [[saptarshi]]. They classify themselves as gotras, named after the ancestor [[rishi]]. Intra-marriage within gotras (Sagotra Vivaha) was uncommon until recently, being discouraged as it was likened to incest.\n\nMost Marathi families have their own family patron or protective deity or the ''[[kuladevata|Kuladaivat]]''. This deity is common to a lineage or a clan of several families who are connected to each other through a common ancestor.{{sfn|Walunjkar|pp=285\u2013287}} The [[Khandoba]] of Jejuri is an example of a Kuladaivat of some families; he is a common Kuladaivat to several castes ranging from [[Brahmin]]s and [[Dhangar]] to [[Dalit]]s.{{sfn|Government of Maharashtra|1962|p=}} The practice of worshiping local or territorial deities as Kuladaivats began in the period of the [[Yadava dynasty]].{{sfn|Walunjkar|pp=285\u2013287}} Other family deities of the people of Maharashtra are [[Bhavani]] of [[Tuljapur]], [[Mahalakshmi Temple, Kolhapur|Mahalaxmi]] of [[Kolhapur]], Mahalaxmi of [[Amravati]], [[Renuka]] of [[Mahur, Maharashtra|Mahur]], [[Parashuram]] in Konkan, [[Saptashringi]] on Saptashringa hill at Vani in Nasik district, and [[Venkateswara|Balaji]] . Despite the system of worshipping ''Kuldaivats'' that Marathi people worship in their respective lineage, the worship of Shri [[Ganesha]], [[Vitthal]] and other popular [[Avatar]]s of [[Vishnu]] such as [[Rama]] or [[Krishna]] are extremely popular across the entire state. The festivals of [[Ganeshotsav]] and annual [[Pandharpur Wari|wari pilgrimage]] to the Vitthal temple at [[Pandharpur]] are of significant importance to all Marathis alike.\n\n====Ceremonies and rituals====\nAt birth, a child is initiated into the family ritually. The child's naming ceremony may happen many weeks or even months later, and it is called the ''b\u0101rsa''. In many Indian Hindu communities, the naming is most often done by consulting the child's horoscope, which suggests various names depending on the child's Lunar sign (called ''Rashi''). However, in Marathi Hindu families, the name that the child inevitably uses in secular functions is the one decided by their parents. If a name is chosen on the basis of the horoscope, then that is kept a secret to ward off the casting of a spell on the child during their life. During the naming ceremony, the child's [[paternal aunt]] has the honor of naming the infant. When the child is 11 months old, they get their first hair-cut.{{sfn|Ghosal|2004|pp=478\u2013480}} This is also an important ritual and is called ''Jawal (\u091c\u093e\u0935\u0933)''. In the Maratha community, the maternal uncle is given the honour of the first snip during the ceremony.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite journal|last1=Carter|first1=A.

The [[Mangalsutra]] is the symbol of marriage for the woman. Studies show that most Indians' traditional views on caste, religion, and family background have remained unchanged when it came to marriage,{{sfn|Bahuguna|2004|p=}} that is, people marry within their own castes,{{sfn|Srinivasa-Raghavan|2009|p=}} and matrimonial advertisements in newspapers are still classified by caste and sub-caste.{{sfn|The Economist|2010|p=}}\n\nWhile arranging a marriage, ''gana'', ''gotra'', ''pravara'', ''devak'' are all kept in mind. Horoscopes are matched.{{sfn|Ghosal|2004|p=479}} Ghosal describes the marriage ceremony as, 'The groom, along with the bride's party goes to the bride's house. A ritual named ''Akshata'' is performed in which people around the groom and bride throw ''haldi'' (turmeric) and ''kunku'' (vermilion) colored rice grains on the couple. After the ''Kanyadan'' ceremony, there is an exchange of garlands between the bride and the groom. Then, the groom ties the Mangalsutra around the neck of the bride. This is followed by ''granthibandhan'' in which the end of the bride's ''s\u0101di/s\u0101ri'' is tied to the end of the groom's dhoti, and a feast is arranged at the groom's place.'\n\nElements of a traditional Marathi Hindu wedding ceremony include ''seemant poojan'' on the wedding eve. The ''dharmic'' wedding includes the ''antarpat'' ceremony followed by the Vedic ceremony which involves the bridegroom and the bride walking around the sacred fire seven times to complete the marriage. Modern urban wedding ceremonies conclude with an evening reception. A Marathi Hindu woman becomes part of her husband's family after marriage and adopts the gotra as well as the traditions of her husband's family.{{#tag:ref|Until about 300 BC, Hindu men were about 24 years of age when they got married and the girl was always post-pubescent.{{sfn|Nagi|1993|pp=6\u20139}} The social evil of child marriage established itself in Hindu society sometime after 300 BC as a response to foreign invasions.{{sfn|Nagi|1993|pp=7}} The problem was first addressed in 1860 by amending the Indian Penal Code which required the boy's age to be 14 and the girl's age to be 12 at minimum, for a marriage to be considered legal. In 1927, the Hindu Child Marriage Act made a marriage between a boy under 15 and a girl under 12 illegal. This minimum age requirement was increased to 14 for girls and 18 for boys in 1929. It was again increased by a year for girls in 1948. The Act was amended again in 1978 when the ages were raised to 18 for girls and 21 for boys.{{sfn|Nagi|1993|pp=9}}|group=note}}\n[[File:019XZZ000000123U00013000(SVC2).jpg|thumb|right|A watercolor painting of Pune from the late Peshwa era as seen from the [[confluence]] of the Mula and Mutha rivers, by British artist [[Henry Salt (Egyptologist)|Henry Salt]].

Even today, girls are married off in their late teens by rural and orthodox educated people. Urban women may choose to remain unmarried until the late 20s or even early 30s.\n\nMarathi Hindu people dispose their dead by [[Antyesti|cremation]].{{sfn|Ghosal|2004|p=479}} The deceased's son carries the corpse to the cremation ground atop a [[bier]]. The eldest son lights the fire for the corpse at the head for males and at the feet for females. The ashes are gathered in an earthen pitcher and immersed in a river on the third day after death. This is a 13-day ritual with the ''pinda'' being offered to the dead soul on the 11th and a ''[[\u015ar\u0101ddha]](Shr\u0101ddha) ceremony'' followed by a funeral feast on the 13th. Cremation is performed according to Vedic rites, usually within a day of the individual's death. Like all other Hindus, the preference is for the ashes to be immersed in a river. Holy rivers such as the [[Ganges]] river or [[Godavari River|Godavari]] have increasingly become popular for this ritual as traveling has become easier in modern times. ''\u015ar\u0101ddha'' becomes an annual ritual in which all forefathers of the family who have passed on are remembered. These rituals are expected to be performed only by male descendants, preferably the eldest son of the deceased.\n\n=== Hindu calendar and festivals ===\n\n[[File:Gudi.jpg|thumb|252x252px|A [[Gudi Padwa|Gudhi]] is erected on Gudhi Padwa.]]\n\nThe Marathi, [[Kannada people|Kannada]] and [[Telugu people]] follow the Deccan [[Shalivahana]] [[Hindu calendar]], which may have subtle differences with calendars followed by other communities in India.

Twenty days before this day, thousands of [[Varkari|Warkari]]s start their pilgrimage to [[Pandharpur]] from the resting places of the saint. For example, in the case of Dynaneshwar, it starts from [[Alandi]] with Dynaneshwar's ''paduka'' (symbolic sandals made out of wood) in a ''Palakhi''. Varkaris carry ''tals'' or small cymbals in their hand, wear [[Hindu prayer beads]] made from ''[[Ocimum tenuiflorum|tulasi]]'' around their necks and sing and dance to the devotional hymns and prayers to [[Vitthala]]. People all over Maharashtra fast on this day and offer prayers in the temples. This day marks the start of [[Chaturmas]] (The four [[monsoon]] months, from [[Asharh|Ashadh]] to [[Kartik (month)|Kartik]]) according to the [[Hindu calendar]]. This is one of the most important fasting days for Marathi Hindu people.\n* [[Guru Purnima|Guru Pournima]]: The full moon day of the month of [[Ashadha|Ashadh]] is celebrated as [[Guru Purnima|Guru Pournima]]. For Hindus ''Guru-Shishya'' (teacher-student) tradition is very important, be it educational or spiritual. Gurus are often equated with God and always regarded as a link between the individual and the immortal. On this day spiritual aspirants and devotees worship Maharshi [[Vyasa]], who is regarded as [[Guru]] of Gurus.\n* Divyanchi Amavasya: The new moon day/last day of the month of Ashadh/\u0906\u0937\u093e\u0922 (falls between June and July of Gregorian Calendar) is celebrated as Divyanchi Amavasya. This new moon signifies the end of the month of Ashadh, and the arrival of the month of [[Shravan]], which is considered the most pious month of the Hindu calendar. On this day, all the traditional lamps of the house are cleaned and fresh wicks are put in. The lamps are then lit and worshiped. People cook a specific item called ''diva'' (literally lamp), prepared by steaming sweet wheat dough batter and shaping it like little lamps. They are eaten warm with ghee.\n* [[Nag Panchami]]: One of the many festivals in India during which Marathi people celebrate and worship nature. ''Nags'' ([[cobra]]s) are worshiped on the fifth day of the month of Shravan (around August) in the Hindu calendar. On Nagpanchami Day, people draw a ''nag'' family depicting the male and female snake and their nine offspring or ''nagkul''. The ''nag'' family is worshiped and a bowl of milk and wet ''chandan'' (sandalwood powder) offered. It is believed that the ''nag'' deity visits the household, enjoys languishing in the moist ''chandan'', drinks the milk offering, and blesses the household with good luck. Women put temporary [[henna]] tattoos (''[[mehndi]]'') on their hand on the previous day, and buy new bangles on Nagpanchami Day. According to folklore, people refrain from digging the soil, cutting vegetables, frying and roasting on a hot plate on this day, while farmers do not harrow their farms to prevent any accidental injury to snakes. In a small village named [[Battis Shirala]] in Maharashtra a big snake festival is held which attracts thousands of tourists from all over the world. In other parts of Maharashtra, snake charmers are seen sitting by the roadsides or moving from one place to another with their baskets holding snakes. While playing the lingering melodious notes on their [[pungi]], they beckon devotees with their calls\u2014''Nagoba-la dudh de Mayi'' ('Give milk to the cobra oh mother!'). Women offer sweetened milk, popcorn (''lahya'' in Marathi) made out of jwari/dhan/corns to the snakes and pray. Cash and old clothes are also given to the snake-charmers. In [[Barshi]] Town in the Solapur district, a big ''jatra'' (carnival) is held at Nagoba Mandir in Tilak chowk.\n* [[Raksha Bandhan|Rakhi Pournima]] and [[Narali Purnima|Narali Pournima]]: Narali Pournima is celebrated on the full moon day of the month of [[Shravan]] in the Shaka Hindu calendar (around August). This is the most important festival for the coastal [[Konkan]] region because the new season for fishing starts on this day. Fishermen and women offer coconuts to the sea and ask for a peaceful season while praying for the sea to remain calm. The same day is celebrated as [[Raksha Bandhan|Rakhi Pournima]] to commemorate the abiding ties between brother and sister in Maharashtra as well other parts of Northern India. ''Narali bhaat'' (sweet rice with coconut) is the main dish on this day. On this day, Brahmin men change their [[sacred thread]] (''Janve''; Marathi: \u091c\u093e\u0928\u0935\u0947) at a common gathering ceremony called Shraavani (Marathi:\u0936\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0935\u0923\u0940).\n[[File:Govindashtami.jpg|thumb|right|Gokulashtami dahi-handi celebration]]\n* [[Gokul Ashtami]]: The birthday of [[Krishna]] is celebrated with great fervour all over India on the eighth day of second fortnight of the month Shravan (usually in the month of August). In Maharashtra, Gokul Ashtami is synonymous with the ceremony of ''[[dahi handi]]''. This is a reenactment of Krishna's efforts to steal butter from a ''matka'' (earthen pot) suspended from the ceiling. Large earthen pots filled with milk, curds, butter, honey, fruits, etc. are suspended at a height of between {{convert|20|and|40|ft}} in the streets. Teams of young men and boys come forward to claim this prize. They construct a human pyramid by standing on each other's shoulders until the pyramid is tall enough to enable the topmost person to reach the pot and claim the contents after breaking it. Currency notes are often tied to the rope by which the pot is suspended. The prize money is distributed among those who participate in the pyramid building. The ''dahi-handi'' draws a huge crowd and they support the teams trying to grab these pots by chanting 'Govinda ala re ala'.\n* Mangala Gaur: Pahili Mangala Gaur (first Mangala Gaur) is one of the most important celebrations for the new brides amongst [[Deshastha Brahmin|Marathi Brahmins]]. On the Tuesday of the month of the Shravan falling within a year after her marriage, the new bride performs [[Lingam|Shivling]] puja for the well-being of her husband and new family. It is also a get-together of all womenfolk. It includes chatting, playing games, ''ukhane'' (married women take their husband's name woven in 2/4 rhyming liners) and sumptuous food. They typically play zimma, fugadi, bhendya (more popularly known as [[Antakshari]] in modern India) until the early hours of the following morning.\n\n[[File:Pola in Chinawal 1.jpg|thumb|right|Oxen decorated for Pola in a village.]]\n* [[Pola (festival)|Bail Pola]]: the festival is celebrated on the new moon day (Pithori Amavasya) of the month of Shravan (August - September), to honor farm [[ox]]en for their service.

Some social activities are also undertaken during this period like blood donation, scholarships for the needy, or donations to people suffering from any kind of natural calamity. Due to environmental concerns, a number of families now avoid bodies of water, and let the clay statue disintegrate in a barrel of water at home.

Gauris arrive in a pair, one as ''Jyeshta'' (the Elder one) and another as ''Kanishta'' (the Younger one). They are treated with love since they represent the daughters arriving at their parents' home. In many parts of Maharashtra including Marathwada and Vidarbha, this festival is called [[Mahalakshmi]] or Mahalakshmya or simply Lakshmya.\n* [[Anant Chaturdashi]]: The 11th day of the Ganesh festival (14th day of the month of Bhadrapada) is celebrated as [[Anant Chaturdashi]], which marks the end of the celebration. People bid a tearful farewell to the God by immersing the installed idols from home/public places in water and chanting 'Ganapati Bappa Morya, pudhchya warshi Lawakar ya!!' ('Ganesha, come early next year.') Some people also keep the traditional wow (Vrata) of Ananta Pooja. This involves the worship of Ananta the coiled snake or Shesha on which Vishnu resides.

During the nine days, Bhondla (also known as 'Bhulabai' in the Vidarbha region of Maharashtra) is celebrated in the garden or on the terrace during evening hours by inviting female friends of the daughter in the house. An elephant is drawn either with [[Rangoli]] on the soil or with a chalk on a slate and kept in the middle. The girls go around it in a circle, holding each other's hands and singing Bhondla songs. All Bhondla songs are traditional songs passed down through the generations. The last song typically ends with the words '...khirapatila kaay ga?' ('What is the special dish today?'). This 'Khirapat' is a special dish, or dishes, often made laboriously by the mother of the host girl. The food is served only after the rest of the girls have correctly guessed what the covered dish or dishes are. There are some variations with how the Navratri festival is celebrated. For example, in many Brahmin families, celebrations include offering lunch for nine days to a specially invited a group of guests. The guests include a married Woman (Marathi:\u0938\u0935\u093e\u0937\u094d\u0923 ), a Brahmin and, a Virgin (Marathi:\u0915\u0941\u092e\u093e\u0930\u093f\u0915\u093e). In the morning and evening, the head of the family ritually worships either the goddess [[Durga]], [[Lakshmi]] or [[Saraswati]]. On the eighth day, a special rite is carried out in some families. A statue of the goddess Mahalakshmi, with the face of a rice mask, is prepared and worshiped by newly married girls. In the evening of that day, women blow into earthen or metallic pots as a form of worship to please the goddess. Everyone in the family accompanies them by chanting verses and [[Bhajans]].

The same evening, or the evening of the next day, is marked by Tulshi Vivah or Tulshicha Lagna. The [[Tulsi]] (Holy Basil plant) is held sacred by the Hindus as it is regarded as an incarnation of Mahalaxmi who was born as Vrinda. The end of Diwali celebrations mark the beginning of Tulshicha Lagna. Marathis organise the marriage of a sacred Tulshi plant in their house with Krishna. On this day the Tulshi vrundavan is coloured and decorated as a bride. Sugarcane and branches of [[tamarind]] and [[Indian gooseberry|amla]] trees are planted along with the tulsi plant. Though a mock marriage, all the ceremonies of an actual Maharashtrian marriage are conducted including chanting of [[mantra]]s, [[Mangal Ashtaka]] and tying of [[Mangal Sutra]] to the Tulshi. Families and friends gather for this marriage ceremony, which usually takes place in the late evening. Various ''pohe'' dishes are offered to Krishna and then distributed among family members and friends.

The main political party formed immediately after liberation was the [[Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party]]. It wanted Goa to merge with Maharashtra because of the affinity between Goan Hindus and the Marathi people. However, the [[Goa Opinion Poll|referendum]] held on this issue rejected the merger. Later, [[Konkani language|Konkani]] was made the official language of Goa, but Marathi is also allowed in any government correspondence.\n\nThe 1960s also saw the establishment by [[Bal Thackeray]] of Shiv Sena, a populist sectarian party advocating the rights of Marathi people in the heterogeneous city of Mumbai. Early campaigns by Shiv Sena advocated for more opportunities for Marathi people in government jobs. The party also led a campaign against the city's South Indian population. By the 1980s the party captured power in the [[Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation|Mumbai Corporation]], and in the 1990s it led the government of Maharashtra's coalition with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). During this transition from founding to capturing power, the party toned down its rhetoric against non-Marathi people and adopted a more Hindu nationalist stance.\n\n== Castes and communities ==\nThe Marathi people form an ethnolinguistic group that is distinct from others in terms of its language, history, cultural and religious practices, social structure, literature, and art.<ref>''Changing India: Bourgeois Revolution on the Subcontinent'' by Robert W.

Other ceremonies for different occasions in Hindu life include ''Vastushanti'' and \"Satyanarayan\" which is performed before a family formally establishes residence in a new house. [[Satyanarayana Puja]] is a ceremony performed before commencing any new endeavour or for no particular reason. Invoking the name of the family's [[gotra]] and the ''kuladaivat'' are important aspects of these ceremonies for many communities. \n[[File:Khandoba in a household shrine.JPG|right|thumb|A Marathi household shrine with [[Khandoba]] at the forefront]]\nLike most other Hindu communities, the Marathi people have a household shrine called a ''devaghar'' with idols, symbols, and pictures of various deities for daily worship. Ritual reading of religious texts known as ''[[Palm-leaf manuscript|pothi]]'' is also popular in some communities.\n\nIn some traditional families, food is first offered to the preferred deity in the household shrine, as ''[[naivedya]]'', before being consumed by family members and guests. Meals or snacks are not taken before this religious offering. In present times, the ''naivedya'' is offered by families only on days of special religious significance.\n\nMany Marathi people trace their paternal ancestors to one of the seven or eight sages, the [[saptarshi]]. They classify themselves as gotras, named after the ancestor [[rishi]]. Intra-marriage within gotras (Sagotra Vivaha) was uncommon until recently, being discouraged as it was likened to incest.\n\nMost Marathi families have their own family patron or protective deity or the ''[[kuladevata|Kuladaivat]]''. This deity is common to a lineage or a clan of several families who are connected to each other through a common ancestor.{{sfn|Walunjkar|pp=285\u2013287}} The [[Khandoba]] of Jejuri is an example of a Kuladaivat of some families; he is a common Kuladaivat to several castes ranging from [[Brahmin]]s and [[Dhangar]] to [[Dalit]]s.{{sfn|Government of Maharashtra|1962|p=}} The practice of worshiping local or territorial deities as Kuladaivats began in the period of the [[Yadava dynasty]].{{sfn|Walunjkar|pp=285\u2013287}} Other family deities of the people of Maharashtra are [[Bhavani]] of [[Tuljapur]], [[Mahalakshmi Temple, Kolhapur|Mahalaxmi]] of [[Kolhapur]], Mahalaxmi of [[Amravati]], [[Renuka]] of [[Mahur, Maharashtra|Mahur]], [[Parashuram]] in Konkan, [[Saptashringi]] on Saptashringa hill at Vani in Nasik district, and [[Venkateswara|Balaji]] . Despite the system of worshipping ''Kuldaivats'' that Marathi people worship in their respective lineage, the worship of Shri [[Ganesha]], [[Vitthal]] and other popular [[Avatar]]s of [[Vishnu]] such as [[Rama]] or [[Krishna]] are extremely popular across the entire state. The festivals of [[Ganeshotsav]] and annual [[Pandharpur Wari|wari pilgrimage]] to the Vitthal temple at [[Pandharpur]] are of significant importance to all Marathis alike.\n\n====Ceremonies and rituals====\nAt birth, a child is initiated into the family ritually. The child's naming ceremony may happen many weeks or even months later, and it is called the ''b\u0101rsa''. In many Indian Hindu communities, the naming is most often done by consulting the child's horoscope, which suggests various names depending on the child's Lunar sign (called ''Rashi''). However, in Marathi Hindu families, the name that the child inevitably uses in secular functions is the one decided by their parents. If a name is chosen on the basis of the horoscope, then that is kept a secret to ward off the casting of a spell on the child during their life. During the naming ceremony, the child's [[paternal aunt]] has the honor of naming the infant. When the child is 11 months old, they get their first hair-cut.{{sfn|Ghosal|2004|pp=478\u2013480}} This is also an important ritual and is called ''Jawal (\u091c\u093e\u0935\u0933)''.

A ritual named ''Akshata'' is performed in which people around the groom and bride throw ''haldi'' (turmeric) and ''kunku'' (vermilion) colored rice grains on the couple. After the ''Kanyadan'' ceremony, there is an exchange of garlands between the bride and the groom. Then, the groom ties the Mangalsutra around the neck of the bride. This is followed by ''granthibandhan'' in which the end of the bride's ''s\u0101di/s\u0101ri'' is tied to the end of the groom's dhoti, and a feast is arranged at the groom's place.'\n\nElements of a traditional Marathi Hindu wedding ceremony include ''seemant poojan'' on the wedding eve. The ''dharmic'' wedding includes the ''antarpat'' ceremony followed by the Vedic ceremony which involves the bridegroom and the bride walking around the sacred fire seven times to complete the marriage. Modern urban wedding ceremonies conclude with an evening reception. A Marathi Hindu woman becomes part of her husband's family after marriage and adopts the gotra as well as the traditions of her husband's family.{{#tag:ref|Until about 300 BC, Hindu men were about 24 years of age when they got married and the girl was always post-pubescent.{{sfn|Nagi|1993|pp=6\u20139}} The social evil of child marriage established itself in Hindu society sometime after 300 BC as a response to foreign invasions.{{sfn|Nagi|1993|pp=7}} The problem was first addressed in 1860 by amending the Indian Penal Code which required the boy's age to be 14 and the girl's age to be 12 at minimum, for a marriage to be considered legal. In 1927, the Hindu Child Marriage Act made a marriage between a boy under 15 and a girl under 12 illegal. This minimum age requirement was increased to 14 for girls and 18 for boys in 1929. It was again increased by a year for girls in 1948.

The eldest son lights the fire for the corpse at the head for males and at the feet for females. The ashes are gathered in an earthen pitcher and immersed in a river on the third day after death. This is a 13-day ritual with the ''pinda'' being offered to the dead soul on the 11th and a ''[[\u015ar\u0101ddha]](Shr\u0101ddha) ceremony'' followed by a funeral feast on the 13th. Cremation is performed according to Vedic rites, usually within a day of the individual's death. Like all other Hindus, the preference is for the ashes to be immersed in a river. Holy rivers such as the [[Ganges]] river or [[Godavari River|Godavari]] have increasingly become popular for this ritual as traveling has become easier in modern times. ''\u015ar\u0101ddha'' becomes an annual ritual in which all forefathers of the family who have passed on are remembered. These rituals are expected to be performed only by male descendants, preferably the eldest son of the deceased.\n\n=== Hindu calendar and festivals ===\n\n[[File:Gudi.jpg|thumb|252x252px|A [[Gudi Padwa|Gudhi]] is erected on Gudhi Padwa.]]\n\nThe Marathi, [[Kannada people|Kannada]] and [[Telugu people]] follow the Deccan [[Shalivahana]] [[Hindu calendar]], which may have subtle differences with calendars followed by other communities in India.

Twenty days before this day, thousands of [[Varkari|Warkari]]s start their pilgrimage to [[Pandharpur]] from the resting places of the saint. For example, in the case of Dynaneshwar, it starts from [[Alandi]] with Dynaneshwar's ''paduka'' (symbolic sandals made out of wood) in a ''Palakhi''. Varkaris carry ''tals'' or small cymbals in their hand, wear [[Hindu prayer beads]] made from ''[[Ocimum tenuiflorum|tulasi]]'' around their necks and sing and dance to the devotional hymns and prayers to [[Vitthala]]. People all over Maharashtra fast on this day and offer prayers in the temples. This day marks the start of [[Chaturmas]] (The four [[monsoon]] months, from [[Asharh|Ashadh]] to [[Kartik (month)|Kartik]]) according to the [[Hindu calendar]]. This is one of the most important fasting days for Marathi Hindu people.\n* [[Guru Purnima|Guru Pournima]]: The full moon day of the month of [[Ashadha|Ashadh]] is celebrated as [[Guru Purnima|Guru Pournima]]. For Hindus ''Guru-Shishya'' (teacher-student) tradition is very important, be it educational or spiritual. Gurus are often equated with God and always regarded as a link between the individual and the immortal. On this day spiritual aspirants and devotees worship Maharshi [[Vyasa]], who is regarded as [[Guru]] of Gurus.\n* Divyanchi Amavasya: The new moon day/last day of the month of Ashadh/\u0906\u0937\u093e\u0922 (falls between June and July of Gregorian Calendar) is celebrated as Divyanchi Amavasya. This new moon signifies the end of the month of Ashadh, and the arrival of the month of [[Shravan]], which is considered the most pious month of the Hindu calendar. On this day, all the traditional lamps of the house are cleaned and fresh wicks are put in. The lamps are then lit and worshiped. People cook a specific item called ''diva'' (literally lamp), prepared by steaming sweet wheat dough batter and shaping it like little lamps. They are eaten warm with ghee.\n* [[Nag Panchami]]: One of the many festivals in India during which Marathi people celebrate and worship nature. ''Nags'' ([[cobra]]s) are worshiped on the fifth day of the month of Shravan (around August) in the Hindu calendar. On Nagpanchami Day, people draw a ''nag'' family depicting the male and female snake and their nine offspring or ''nagkul''. The ''nag'' family is worshiped and a bowl of milk and wet ''chandan'' (sandalwood powder) offered. It is believed that the ''nag'' deity visits the household, enjoys languishing in the moist ''chandan'', drinks the milk offering, and blesses the household with good luck. Women put temporary [[henna]] tattoos (''[[mehndi]]'') on their hand on the previous day, and buy new bangles on Nagpanchami Day. According to folklore, people refrain from digging the soil, cutting vegetables, frying and roasting on a hot plate on this day, while farmers do not harrow their farms to prevent any accidental injury to snakes. In a small village named [[Battis Shirala]] in Maharashtra a big snake festival is held which attracts thousands of tourists from all over the world. In other parts of Maharashtra, snake charmers are seen sitting by the roadsides or moving from one place to another with their baskets holding snakes. While playing the lingering melodious notes on their [[pungi]], they beckon devotees with their calls\u2014''Nagoba-la dudh de Mayi'' ('Give milk to the cobra oh mother!'). Women offer sweetened milk, popcorn (''lahya'' in Marathi) made out of jwari/dhan/corns to the snakes and pray. Cash and old clothes are also given to the snake-charmers. In [[Barshi]] Town in the Solapur district, a big ''jatra'' (carnival) is held at Nagoba Mandir in Tilak chowk.\n* [[Raksha Bandhan|Rakhi Pournima]] and [[Narali Purnima|Narali Pournima]]: Narali Pournima is celebrated on the full moon day of the month of [[Shravan]] in the Shaka Hindu calendar (around August). This is the most important festival for the coastal [[Konkan]] region because the new season for fishing starts on this day. Fishermen and women offer coconuts to the sea and ask for a peaceful season while praying for the sea to remain calm. The same day is celebrated as [[Raksha Bandhan|Rakhi Pournima]] to commemorate the abiding ties between brother and sister in Maharashtra as well other parts of Northern India. ''Narali bhaat'' (sweet rice with coconut) is the main dish on this day. On this day, Brahmin men change their [[sacred thread]] (''Janve''; Marathi: \u091c\u093e\u0928\u0935\u0947) at a common gathering ceremony called Shraavani (Marathi:\u0936\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0935\u0923\u0940).\n[[File:Govindashtami.jpg|thumb|right|Gokulashtami dahi-handi celebration]]\n* [[Gokul Ashtami]]: The birthday of [[Krishna]] is celebrated with great fervour all over India on the eighth day of second fortnight of the month Shravan (usually in the month of August). In Maharashtra, Gokul Ashtami is synonymous with the ceremony of ''[[dahi handi]]''. This is a reenactment of Krishna's efforts to steal butter from a ''matka'' (earthen pot) suspended from the ceiling. Large earthen pots filled with milk, curds, butter, honey, fruits, etc. are suspended at a height of between {{convert|20|and|40|ft}} in the streets. Teams of young men and boys come forward to claim this prize. They construct a human pyramid by standing on each other's shoulders until the pyramid is tall enough to enable the topmost person to reach the pot and claim the contents after breaking it. Currency notes are often tied to the rope by which the pot is suspended. The prize money is distributed among those who participate in the pyramid building. The ''dahi-handi'' draws a huge crowd and they support the teams trying to grab these pots by chanting 'Govinda ala re ala'.\n* Mangala Gaur: Pahili Mangala Gaur (first Mangala Gaur) is one of the most important celebrations for the new brides amongst [[Deshastha Brahmin|Marathi Brahmins]]. On the Tuesday of the month of the Shravan falling within a year after her marriage, the new bride performs [[Lingam|Shivling]] puja for the well-being of her husband and new family. It is also a get-together of all womenfolk. It includes chatting, playing games, ''ukhane'' (married women take their husband's name woven in 2/4 rhyming liners) and sumptuous food. They typically play zimma, fugadi, bhendya (more popularly known as [[Antakshari]] in modern India) until the early hours of the following morning.\n\n[[File:Pola in Chinawal 1.jpg|thumb|right|Oxen decorated for Pola in a village.]]\n* [[Pola (festival)|Bail Pola]]: the festival is celebrated on the new moon day (Pithori Amavasya) of the month of Shravan (August - September), to honor farm [[ox]]en for their service.

Some social activities are also undertaken during this period like blood donation, scholarships for the needy, or donations to people suffering from any kind of natural calamity. Due to environmental concerns, a number of families now avoid bodies of water, and let the clay statue disintegrate in a barrel of water at home.

During the nine days, Bhondla (also known as 'Bhulabai' in the Vidarbha region of Maharashtra) is celebrated in the garden or on the terrace during evening hours by inviting female friends of the daughter in the house. An elephant is drawn either with [[Rangoli]] on the soil or with a chalk on a slate and kept in the middle. The girls go around it in a circle, holding each other's hands and singing Bhondla songs. All Bhondla songs are traditional songs passed down through the generations. The last song typically ends with the words '...khirapatila kaay ga?' ('What is the special dish today?'). This 'Khirapat' is a special dish, or dishes, often made laboriously by the mother of the host girl. The food is served only after the rest of the girls have correctly guessed what the covered dish or dishes are. There are some variations with how the Navratri festival is celebrated. For example, in many Brahmin families, celebrations include offering lunch for nine days to a specially invited a group of guests.

In the morning and evening, the head of the family ritually worships either the goddess [[Durga]], [[Lakshmi]] or [[Saraswati]]. On the eighth day, a special rite is carried out in some families. A statue of the goddess Mahalakshmi, with the face of a rice mask, is prepared and worshiped by newly married girls. In the evening of that day, women blow into earthen or metallic pots as a form of worship to please the goddess. Everyone in the family accompanies them by chanting verses and [[Bhajans]].

In Marathi tradition, during days of Diwali, family members have a ritual bath before dawn and then sit down for a breakfast of fried sweets and savory snacks. These sweets and snacks are offered to visitors to the house during the multi-day festival and exchanged with neighbors. Typical sweet preparations include ''[[Laddu|Ladu]]'', ''[[Anarsa|Anarse]]'', [[Shankarpali]], and ''[[Dumpling|Karanjya]]''.

On this day, Hindus, particularly the followers of Vishnu, celebrate his awakening after a [[Yoganidra]] of four months of [[Chaturmas]]. People worship him and fast for the entire day. The same evening, or the evening of the next day, is marked by Tulshi Vivah or Tulshicha Lagna. The [[Tulsi]] (Holy Basil plant) is held sacred by the Hindus as it is regarded as an incarnation of Mahalaxmi who was born as Vrinda. The end of Diwali celebrations mark the beginning of Tulshicha Lagna. Marathis organise the marriage of a sacred Tulshi plant in their house with Krishna. On this day the Tulshi vrundavan is coloured and decorated as a bride. Sugarcane and branches of [[tamarind]] and [[Indian gooseberry|amla]] trees are planted along with the tulsi plant. Though a mock marriage, all the ceremonies of an actual Maharashtrian marriage are conducted including chanting of [[mantra]]s, [[Mangal Ashtaka]] and tying of [[Mangal Sutra]] to the Tulshi. Families and friends gather for this marriage ceremony, which usually takes place in the late evening. Various ''pohe'' dishes are offered to Krishna and then distributed among family members and friends. This also marks the beginning of marriage season.\nThe celebration lasts for three days and ends on Kartiki [[Purnima (day)|Pournima]] or Tripurari Pournima.\n[[File:Khandoba temple Pune.jpg|thumb|.Devotees showering turmeric powder (bhandara) on each other at Khandoba Temple in [[Jejuri]] during Champa Shashthi.]]\n* [[Khandoba]] Festival/Champa Shashthi: This is a six-day festival, from the first to the sixth lunar day of the bright fortnight of the Hindu month of [[Margashirsha]].

As it is customary in these communities not to consume onions, garlic, and [[egg plant]] (Brinjal / Aubergine) during the Chaturmas, the consumption of these food items resumes with ritual preparation of Bharit ([[Baingan Bharta]]) and ''rodga'', small round flat bread prepared from ''jwari'' (white [[millet]]).\n*Darshvel Amavasya: It is last day of the Hindu month ''Pausha''. This festival is mostly celebrated in [[Marathwada]] region, especially in [[Latur]], [[Osmanabad]], [[Beed]], [[Nanded]] and [[Bidar]] districts. Special for farmers, people get to their farms and invite friends and relatives their. Place deity (''Sthan daivata'') is worshipped on occasion. [[Alum]] powder is applied to five stones representing five [[Pandavas]]. They are covered with hut of grass and pink cloth (''shalu'') is tied to hut. Farmer pours [[buttermilk]] around the deity idol and all over the field praying \"ol ghe ol ghe saalam pol ge\" (meaning ''be wet and let the year be wealthy till next Darshvel Amavasya''). The festival is celebrated with unique meal containing many items. \n* [[Bhogi]]: The eve of the Hindu festival '[[Makar Sankranti]]' and the day before is called Bhogi. Bhogi is a festival of happiness and enjoyment and generally takes place on 13 January. It is celebrated in honour of Indra, 'the God of Clouds and Rains'. Indra is worshiped for the abundance of the harvest, which brings plenty and prosperity to the land. Since it is held in the winter, the main food for Bhogi is mixed vegetable curry made with carrots, lima beans, green [[capsicum]]s, [[Drumstick (vegetable)|drumsticks]], [[green beans]] and peas. Bajra roti (i.e. roti made of [[pearl millet]]) topped with sesame as well as rice and ''moog dal khichadi'' are eaten to keep warm in winter. During this festival people also take baths with sesame seeds.\n[[File:Tilgul kha god god bola.jpg|right|thumb|Traditional Sesame seed based sweets for Makar Sankrant]]\n* [[Makar Sankranti]]: Sankraman means the passing of the sun from one zodiac sign to the next.

Leeds had decided to niggle at Liverpool, and in particular Keegan, in the match. In one instance [[Johnny Giles]] punched the unsuspecting Keegan and was reprieved after Keegan asked the referee to be lenient.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1094\u20131178}} Giles, after escaping a red card, then later lunged two-footed at Keegan.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1094\u20131178}} Upon Keegan's outraged reaction [[Billy Bremner]] challenged Keegan.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1094\u20131178}} Keegan then exploded and punched Bremner.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1094\u20131178}} Bremner punched back.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1094\u20131178}} They were sent off, the first time anyone had been sent off in a Charity Shield match.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1094\u20131178}} Both players removed their shirts in protest, with Keegan visibly shaken by the decision.

There were numerous honours for Keegan over the next two years, however, as Liverpool again won the League championship and UEFA Cup in [[1975\u201376 in English football|1975\u201376]]. Keegan scored in both legs of the UEFA Cup final against [[Club Brugge KV|FC Bruges]], having only scored once previously during Liverpool's run in the competition.{{sfnp|Keegan|1998|pp=53\u201382}}\n\nIn [[1976\u201377 Liverpool F.C. season|1976\u201377]], Keegan helped Liverpool get close to an unprecedented \"[[treble (association football)|treble]]\" of League championship, FA Cup and [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]], although midway through the season he announced his intention to leave in the summer to play abroad. Nevertheless, Keegan was irrepressible as Liverpool clinched the title and reached the finals of both Cup competitions. Keegan's last appearance in a Liverpool shirt on home soil saw Liverpool lose the FA Cup final to bitter rivals [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], ending the possibility of the treble.{{sfnp|Keegan|1998|pp=53\u201382}} The European Cup final in [[Rome]] against Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach was four days later. Keegan did not score, but he did make a late run which led to a foul inside the penalty area by [[Berti Vogts]]. This led to a penalty which was successfully converted by [[Phil Neal]], sealing a 3\u20131 win. In this season, on the 4 December 1976, Keegan's father, who had been suffering from cancer, died at the age of 71.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 352}}\n\nAfter 323 appearances and exactly 100 goals, Keegan left Liverpool. He had been made offers from clubs across Europe, and chose to join [[Hamburger SV]] in the West German [[Bundesliga]] for \u00a3500,000. Liverpool replaced him with [[Kenny Dalglish]].{{sfnp|Keegan|1998|pp=53\u201382}} Of his time in Liverpool, Keegan later said, \"The only thing I fear is missing an open goal in front of the [[Spion Kop (stadia)|Kop]].

Keegan had a lot of respect for Zebec,{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1522}} though Keegan also reasoned that Zebec's extreme fitness regime philosophy was flawed for the modern-day footballer.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1522-1527}} Keegan even told Zebec that his training regime would burn himself out as a footballer and that he believed he would be finished from playing by 30 if he continued.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1522-1527}} Zebec, in turn responded to Keegan's critique and explained to Keegan it was the same for all the players.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1522-1527}} Keegan then implied to Zebec that players have different roles and not all players run the same distances on match days; he pointed out to Zebec that because of his role and his effort, on match days not many players in the squad ran as much as himself.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1522-1527}} At Hamburg Keegan even doodled with a pen and paper what he thought of the training regime.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1522}} Keegan, as the metaphorical prisoner, drew a cartoon picture of Zebec in sunglasses, with he and his teammates doing press-ups, and then scribed Roman numerals conveying Keegan was counting down to his freedom.

He went on to captain England 31 times, retaining the captain's armband until his international retirement after the [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982 World Cup]].\n\nKeegan captained England at the [[UEFA Euro 1980|1980 Euros]]. England failed to progress from the group stage after finishing third in their group behind Italy and Belgium.\n\nHe managed only one World Cup appearance though, after England failed to qualify for both the [[1974 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)#Group 5|1974]] and [[1978 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)#Group 2|1978]] tournaments. He finally reached a [[1982 FIFA World Cup|World Cup in 1982]] when England got to the finals in Spain. He was named in the squad for the tournament, but was suffering from a chronic back injury and was unfit to play in all of England's group games. In a last, desperate effort to play in a World Cup (he knew that he would not be around for the 1986 competition) he secretly hired a car and drove from Spain to a [[medical specialist|specialist]] he knew in Germany for intensive treatment. He recovered sufficiently to appear as a substitute for the last 26 minutes of England's final second-round game against hosts [[Spain national football team|Spain]].

They had been relegated from the [[Football League First Division|top flight]] in 1989 and narrowly missed out on promotion in 1990 after losing in the playoffs to arch-rivals [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], but in 1991 they had failed to make the playoffs and at several stages in [[1991\u201392 in English football|1991\u201392]], they had temporarily occupied bottom place in the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]]. Following the dismissal of previous manager [[Ossie Ardiles]], Keegan was appointed to prevent Newcastle from being relegated to the [[Football League Third Division|third tier]] of [[Football in England|English football]] for the first time. Keegan joined a club that still had participants from the old board room battles that had been going on at the club for decades.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=kindle location 2302-2314}} It has been argued the internal struggles from the former regime had held the club back.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=kindle location 2302-2314}} After three or more years trying, John Hall had recently won the board room from the old regime.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=kindle location 2302-2314}} Though John Hall was not yet confirmed as the chairman he had accrued enough power to make the key decisions.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=kindle location 2302-2314}} The board members belonging to the former regime were only told by John Hall, one hour before Keegan\u2019s first press conference that Kevin Keegan would be the manager.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=kindle location 2302-2314}} Keegan had only watched two live matches in seven years. One was the European Cup final in 1991 and the other being a Newcastle United 0-0 draw against Blackburn; as such, calls were made that suggested Keegan was unprepared and inexperienced.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2323-2341}} \n\nWhen Keegan turned up to Benwell for his first training session as manager, he noted the training ground was in a mess. Keegan was surprised at the timely neglect of the training ground facilities.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2353-2374}} The training ground was in the process of being sold, despite this, Keegan paid for the clean up of the training ground with of his own money,{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2353-2374}} with the cleaning work being done in one weekend.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2353-2374}} Keegan felt this clean up work was an important move and an indirect statement to the players that conveyed to the players that their professionalism, from now on, had to be high.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2353-2374}} Assessing the squad, Keegan opined that the squad was not good enough to reach the level he and McDermott once played at.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2380-2400}} In five-a-sides he and Terry Mcdermott, both in their 40s, with their lack of conditioning, believed they were two of the stand out players.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2380-2400}} Keegan noted the club had an impressive crop of youth players. This crop included: [[Lee Clark (footballer)|Lee Clark]], [[Steve Watson]], [[Steve Howey (footballer)|Steve Howey]], [[Alan Thompson (footballer, born 1973)|Alan Thompson]] and [[Robbie Elliott]].{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2380-2400}} These young players would form a core of players involved in Keegan's Newcastle squads from 1992 to 1997.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2380-2400}} Prior to his first game, Keegan made his first tough call with his squad of players when he dropped the midfielder Lee Clark.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2400-2405}} Though he liked Clark's spirit, Keegan believed he was at risk of being sent off.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2400-2405}} Keegan's first game, against Bristol City, ended in 3-0 victory in front of a capacity crowd.\n\nKeegan's managerial guidance in the 1991\u201392 season helped secure survival, which meant Newcastle United would play in the new Division One for the [[1992\u201393 in English football|1992\u201393 season]]. Chairman [[John Hall (businessman)|John Hall]] also promised Keegan millions of pounds to spend on new players after Keegan almost walked out on the club after a match, in the 1991\u201392 season, at home to [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] which was played on the 14 March 1992.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Turnbull|first1=Simon|title=Welcome to the North-east...

Newcastle began the season with 11 successive wins and led the league virtually all season, and the club record signing of [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] striker [[Andy Cole]] in February further strengthened their side; Cole netted 12 goals in his first 12 games for the club. The addition of [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]]'s [[Rob Lee]] bolstered the midfield in the autumn.\n\nNewcastle were promoted to the Premier League as Division One champions.\n\nTop scorer [[David Kelly (association footballer)|David Kelly]] and influential midfielder [[Gavin Peacock]] were both sold during the close season, and Keegan brought striker [[Peter Beardsley]] back to Newcastle from [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], six years after he had been sold by Newcastle to Liverpool.\n\n[[1993\u201394 in English football|1993\u201394]] was an enormous success for Newcastle as they finished third in the Premier League and qualified for the UEFA Cup, bringing European football to the club for the first time since the 1970s. Andy Cole was the Premier League's top scorer with 34 goals from 40 games, and managed a club record total of 41 goals in all competitions.\n\nKeegan then strengthened his side by signing [[Switzerland national football team|Swiss]] [[FIFA World Cup 1994|World Cup]] defender [[Marc Hottiger]] and [[Belgium national football team|Belgium's]] defensive midfielder [[Philippe Albert]], while [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]]'s quick winger [[Ruel Fox]] had arrived on transfer deadline day in March 1994.\n\nNewcastle won their first six games of the [[1994\u201395 in English football|1994\u201395 season]] to top the league and they appeared capable of winning their first league title since 1927. But the shock departure of Andy Cole to Manchester United in January weakened their attack, and finished the season sixth place in the final table; not enough for even another UEFA Cup campaign. In the meantime, autumn signing [[Paul Kitson]] partnered Beardsley in attack.\n\nKeegan made several important additions to the Newcastle side in the summer of 1995: [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] goalkeeper [[Shaka Hislop]], [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]]'s French winger [[David Ginola]], [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] striker [[Les Ferdinand]] and [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] defender [[Warren Barton]]. Ferdinand was Newcastle's biggest signing at \u00a36 million, while the \u00a34 million paid for Barton was the highest fee paid for a defender in English football at the time.\n\nNewcastle excelled in the first half of the [[1995\u201396 in English football|1995\u201396 season]], going ten points ahead on 23 December 1995 and holding a 12-point lead from early in January to 4 February. After a 2\u20130 defeat at [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] on 21 February, the lead was cut to nine points. A 1\u20130 defeat at the hands of fellow title challengers Manchester United cut the gap to a single point on 4 March, and within two weeks Newcastle's lead was overhauled and they were unable to recover it. Newcastle's [[Liverpool F.C. 4\u20133 Newcastle United F.C. (1996)|4\u20133 defeat]] to Liverpool on 3 April is widely considered<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/moslive/article-1300229/Premier-League-games-Ten-greatest.html|title=Ten of the greatest: Premier League games}}</ref> to be one of the classic Premier League games. With two games remaining Newcastle and Manchester United both had 76 points. Newcastle only got one point in a 1\u20131 drawn match against Nottingham Forest on 2 May, and with a 1\u20131 draw for Newcastle against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] on the final day of the season on 5 May, the title was won by United, whose 3\u20130 triumph at [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] would have won them the title regardless of Newcastle's result against Tottenham. Keegan stated in 2018 that if Newcastle United had won the title in that season, the squad, which included players such as [[Les Ferdinand]], [[Darren Peacock]], [[David Ginola]], [[Peter Beardsley]], [[Faustino Asprilla]] and [[Rob Lee]] would have stayed together, may have built up a momentum, and won more trophies.<ref name=etainers042018>{{cite web | url = https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/we-could-won-couple-more-14476551 | title = 'We could have won a couple more titles' \u2013 Kevin Keegan discusses Newcastle's Entertainers | last = McCormick | first = Sean | date = 2 April 2018 | work = Chronicle | location = Newcastle-upon-Tyne| access-date = 2 April 2018 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the race for the 1995\u201396 title, Keegan directed remarks at the Manchester United manager, [[Alex Ferguson|Sir Alex Ferguson]], during a post-match interview live on [[Sky Sports]].

A club statement following his resignation read:\n\n<blockquote>Newcastle United Football Club today announce the resignation of manager Kevin Keegan. Kevin informed the board of his wish to resign at the end of the season, having decided he no longer wishes to continue in football management at this stage in his life. Following lengthy discussions of which the board attempted to persuade Kevin to change his mind, both parties eventually agreed that the best route forward was for the club to, reluctantly, accept his resignation with immediate effect.</blockquote>\n\nKeegan left the club with a short statement reading:<blockquote>It was my decision and my decision alone to resign. I feel I have taken the club as far as I can, and that it would be in the best interests of all concerned if I resigned now. I wish the club and everyone concerned with it all the best for the future.</blockquote>\n\nOn the Newcastle United DVD ''Magpie Magic'', it is said that chairman [[John Hall (businessman)|Sir John Hall]] asked for a long term commitment as manager from him which he was unwilling to give, while it also states that many still rumour that the pressure and criticism of selling Andy Cole and the failed title challenge in 1995\u201396 took its toll on him.<ref>{{cite video|title= Newcastle United Magpie Magic|publisher=ITV DVD}}</ref>\n\nHe was succeeded by Kenny Dalglish, the same man who had replaced him as a player at Liverpool 20 years earlier, but Newcastle were unable to win the title and finished second place in the same season, and in the following season finished outside the top ten in the Premier League, although they were FA Cup runners-up. They did not return to the top five of the Premier League until the [[2001\u201302 in English football|2001\u201302 season]], when they finished fourth under Bobby Robson.\n\nIt was during this period that Keegan gained the nickname \"King Kev\" from Newcastle fans.\n\n===Fulham===\nKeegan returned to football on 25 September 1997 as \"chief operating officer\" (a similar role to a [[director of football]]) at [[Football League Second Division|Division Two]] club [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]], with [[Ray Wilkins]] as head coach. Fulham finished sixth in the final table, but Wilkins was sacked just before the first leg of the playoff semi-final and Keegan took over as manager.\n\nHis appointment came a few months after the takeover of the club by [[Harrods]] owner [[Mohamed Al-Fayed]], who gave Keegan \u00a310 million to spend on players that season as the first part of a \u00a340 million attempt to deliver Premier League football to the [[Craven Cottage]] club, who had been outside the top flight since 1968 and had not even played in the league's second tier since 1986.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.thefreelibrary.com/KEV%27S+pounds+40m+SPREE%253b+Fulham+to+buy+place+at+the+top.-a061069826 | title = KEV'S pounds 40m SPREE; Fulham to buy place at the top | publisher = The Mirror | work = thefreelibrary.com | date = 25 September 1997 | accessdate = 19 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nKeegan was unable to inspire Fulham to overcome [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]] in the playoffs, but good form in [[1998\u201399 in English football|1998\u201399]] \u2013 helped by the acquisition of more players who would normally have been signed by Premier League or Division one clubs \u2013 clinched them the Division Two title and promotion to Division One, but Keegan left at the end of the season to concentrate on his duties as England manager, having succeeded [[Glenn Hoddle]] in February 1999.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-keegan-leaves-with-flea-in-his-ear-1092405.html|title=Keegan leaves with flea in his ear|work=The Independent (London)|date=9 May 1999|accessdate=10 August 2014|first=Steve|last=Tongue}}</ref>\n\nFulham replaced Keegan with [[Paul Bracewell]] and reached the Premier League two years later under Bracewell's successor [[Jean Tigana]], with a squad still featuring many of the players bought by Keegan or Wilkins.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-bracewell-in-the-fulham-frame-1090562.html|title=Bracewell in the Fulham frame|work=The Independent (London)|date=30 April 1999|accessdate=10 August 2014|first=Szreter|last=Adam}}</ref>\n\n===England===\n[[File:Azzopardi keegan.jpg|thumb|Keegan as England manager with a Newcastle United fan in [[Malta]]]]\nAfter weeks of speculation,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/280387.stm|title=Keegan poised for England job|work=BBC News |date=16 February 1999|accessdate=25 January 2009}}</ref> Keegan was named as the new England manager on 18 February 1999, succeeding Glenn Hoddle, who had been sacked two weeks earlier following a newspaper interview in which he suggested that disabled people were being punished for their sins in a previous life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-21444561.html|title=Keegan appointed for England s Euro 2000 campaign|date=18 February 1999|accessdate=25 January 2009|publisher=AAP Sports News (Australia)|first=Trevor|last=Marshallsea}}{{Dead link|date=August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Keegan in charge \u2013 for now |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sport/football/281172.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=17 February 1999 |accessdate=10 February 2012}}</ref> He led the team to a winning start with 3\u20131 victory over [[Poland national football team|Poland]] to reignite England's [[UEFA Euro 2000|Euro 2000]] qualifying campaign,<ref>{{cite news |title=Scholes gives Keegan winning start |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sport/football/305631.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=28 March 1999 |accessdate=10 February 2012}}</ref> and they entered the qualification playoff with [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]].

The tribunal ruled in favour of Keegan, agreeing that Newcastle had [[constructive dismissal|constructively dismissed]] him by insisting on the signing of midfielder [[Ignacio Mar\u00eda Gonz\u00e1lez|Nacho Gonz\u00e1lez]] on loan (which was against his wishes) to replace [[James Milner]] following his move to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] and a bid for Bayern Munich's [[Bastian Schweinsteiger]] being rejected.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/incredible-story-newcastle-trying-sign-12813690|title = The incredible story of Newcastle trying to sign Schweinsteiger on the cheap \u2013 and Keegan quitting|first=Mark | last=Douglas |work=Evening Chronicle|date=29 March 2017|accessdate=7 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe ruling<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nufc.com/2009-10html/2009-10-02kk-vs-nufc.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128060800/http://www.nufc.com/2009-10html/2009-10-02kk-vs-nufc.html| archivedate=28 November 2010| title=KK v NUFC \u2013 the verdict|publisher=nufc.com|date=2 October 2009|accessdate=10 August 2014}}</ref> was based around seven issues. The panel declared that Keegan had been misled to believe he had the final decision on player transfers, and was never explicitly told in writing, his contract, or word of mouth that he did not or that his role would see him essentially report to others. Given the generally understood role of a Premiership manager, the panel agreed he could reasonably expect that this was not a factor. The club's signing of Gonz\u00e1lez meant that they had violated his employment contract, which amounted to constructive dismissal. While Gonz\u00e1lez was the main issue in the panel final decision, the club's alleged mistreatment of Keegan, claiming they were in a position to sack him should he have not agreed to the terms they offered him, as well as his decision to remain at the club until the 4 September instead of resigning on 1 September, allowing the club to reach a compromise, led to the panel ruling in Keegan's favour. Keegan was awarded \u00a32&nbsp;million (plus interest accrued) according to severance clauses in his contract, which the club never paid him after his departure. Claims for more were turned down on the basis that the standard contract severance clauses covered constructive dismissal, but he stated afterwards that the purpose of his claim had been to restore his reputation, and was delighted with the outcome, allowing him to move forward.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/n/newcastle_united/8286967.stm |work=BBC News  | title=Keegan wins \u00a32m Newcastle damages | date=2 October 2009 | accessdate=7 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn pursuit of winning the tribunal, the club admitted to misleading the media and their fans. Several key senior staff, including Dennis Wise and [[Derek Llambias]], had publicly claimed that Keegan had \"the final word\"; they claimed to the tribunal that this was not in fact the case and that their claims were just \"PR\". It was then revealed that Director of Football Dennis Wise asked Keegan to sign Gonz\u00e1lez by watching him \"on [[YouTube]]\". On 21 October, a subsequent meeting of the same panel found that the club should pay all legal and associated costs incurred by Keegan as a result of the tribunal. They reached this conclusion based on their view that the club's \"defence on the primary liability issue was, in our view, wholly without merit\".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11678_5642081,00.html | work=Sky Sports | title=Magpies must pay Keegan costs | date = 21 October 2009 | accessdate =3 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nKeegan stated after the hearing he still wants to manage in the top flight of football, and would consider returning to his position at the club, but feels the fans may be exhausted from his last tenure and would prefer him not to.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11678_5608630,00.html | work=Sky Sports | title=Keegan wants to manage again | date = 5 October 2009 | accessdate =3 March 2012 | first = Richard | last = Bailey}}</ref> In June 2013, Keegan stated he would only consider a return should owner Mike Ashley leave the club.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/kevin-keegan-labels-return-to-newcastle-as-an-absolute-living-nightmare-8648184.html | location=London | work=The Independent | title=Kevin Keegan labels return to Newcastle as 'an absolute living nightmare' | date=6 June 2013}}</ref> Keegan has continued to criticise Ashley, accusing him of a lack of respect for the fans.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/newcastle-united-news-kevin-keegan-3492049 | work=Daily Mirror | title=Kevin Keegan slams Newcastle owner Mike Ashley for showing 'a total lack of respect' to supporters | date = 3 May 2014 | accessdate =16 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2009, nearly a year after his departure from Newcastle, Keegan resurfaced after being confirmed as the lead pundit on [[ESPN (UK)|ESPN]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/aug/24/espn-premiership-kevin-keegan | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=ESPN signs Kevin Keegan to front its Premier League coverage | first=Mark | last=Sweney | date=24 August 2009 | accessdate=7 May 2010}}</ref> During the course of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]], Keegan featured as a pundit for [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]] broadcasts.

At Liverpool, Keegan won three [[Football League First Division|First Division]] titles, the [[UEFA Cup]] twice, the [[FA Cup]] and the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]]. He also gained his first England cap in 1972, and moved to West German club Hamburger SV in the summer of 1977. At Hamburg, he was named [[Ballon d'Or|European Footballer of the Year]] in 1978 and 1979, won the [[Bundesliga]] title in 1978\u201379, and reached the European Cup final in 1980. Keegan moved to [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] that summer, and spent two seasons at the club before a transfer to Newcastle United in the English [[Football League Division Two|second division]] in 1982. He helped Newcastle to promotion in his second season, and retired from football in 1984, having been capped 63&nbsp;times for England, scoring 21&nbsp;goals.\n\nHe moved into management at Newcastle in 1992, winning promotion as First Division champions. Newcastle then finished second in the [[Premier League]] in 1995\u201396, after leading for most of the season. After a spell at Fulham, he took charge of the England team in February 1999, but resigned in October 2000, following a 1\u20130 loss against Germany in qualification for the [[2002 FIFA World Cup qualification \u2013 UEFA Group 9|2002 FIFA World Cup]]. He then became manager of Manchester City in 2001 and spent four years at the club before resigning in 2005. He had been out of football for almost three years when he returned to Newcastle United for a second spell as manager in January 2008.

Despite being one of two players kept on for an extra six-week period, the club did not offer Keegan a contract, though they did offer apprenticeship terms to the right-back [[Brian Joy]] who also went onto have a 15-year career in football.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 492\u2013513}} Keegan also had a trial with his local football club Doncaster Rovers. The trial was arranged by his father but when Keegan arrived for a trial he found out he had been given the wrong information and the trial was earlier in the day and at a different place.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 486}}\n\nKeegan was in to sports, such as cross country running, rugby, football, and even captaining his schools poor cricket team.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 508\u2013509}} He also boxed at his local boxing club run by the former British Heavyweight champion boxer [[Bruce Woodcock (boxer)|Bruce Woodcock]].{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1345}} At age 15 Keegan, with two friends, ran a 50-mile run from [[Nottingham]] to [[Doncaster]]. After completing this run Keegan claimed he would never hit a psychological brick wall again with regards to running. In his autobiography Keegan claimed this run prepared him physically and psychologically for any running he had to do in any future pre-season training or football matches.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 636\u2013650}} Keegan, distracted by sport, would leave school with [['O'Level]]s in History and Art.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 511}}\n\nAt the age of 15 Keegan started work at [[Pegler Yorkshire|Pegler Brass Works]] as an office clerk; though Keegan admitted he was more of a tea boy and a messenger than an office clerk.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 512}} Whilst working at Pegler, Keegan continued playing Saturday afternoon football for his local youth club Enfield House and playing Sunday morning football for the Lonsdale Hotel.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 518}} It was whilst he was at Pegler that a colleague of Keegan, named Harry Holland, asked Keegan if he fancied a go at playing for the Peglers Works reserves on a Saturday morning; down beaten Keegan accepted the offer to play for the reserve team.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 521}} His chance at professional football did not come at Pegler Works reserves, but came when he was playing Sunday morning league football. When Keegan was playing for the Lonsdale Hotel in a match against Woodfield Social in 1966, Keegan was marked by an older player, in his mid 30s, called Bob Nellis. After playing against Keegan, Nellis became impressed by the ability of Keegan. Nellis had some contacts at Scunthorpe United, and in turn offered Keegan a trial at [[Football League Fourth Division|fourth division]] [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]] \u2013 one of just two professional sides in the division. This trial would lead to the Scunthorpe manager [[Ron Ashman]] giving Keegan his first contract in professional football.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 530\u2013543}}<ref name=\"bbcsport\"/>{{sfnp|Keegan|1998|pp=53\u201382}}\n\n==Playing career==\n===Scunthorpe United (1966\u20131971)===\nScunthorpe United could not afford a set of football nets and trained on a rugby pitch at [[Quibell Park Stadium|Quibell Park]].{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 582}} They also, risking injury, had five-a-side training sessions on the Old Showground concrete car park.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 586}} Still though, at Scunthorpe Keegan would take his training very seriously. Twice a week, after training, Keegan would train with a teammate named Derek Hemstead and they would train by doing weighted [[farmers walk]]s up and down the cantilever stand at the [[Old Showground]].{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 657}} A trait Keegan had was his running ability. In running drills at Scunthorpe Keegan liked trying to finish first and Keegan was told by Jack Brownsword that one thing he has going for him is that he is a one hundred percenter and he should never lose that.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 652}} Though this will to be first in his running drills would later irritate senior pro's such as Liverpool's [[Tommy Smith (footballer, born 1945)|Tommy Smith]]{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 650}} and Shankly would later advise Keegan that he did not have to win all his runs.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 649}}\n\nScunthorpe, a club with little money, did not have a full-time driver to drive them to away games and Keegan, with other the other younger players, such as Nigel Jackson, would take turns in driving the minibus to and from away games.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 578}} Young Keegan, fellow driver Nigel Jackson and fellow young professionals Jimmy Coyne, Alan Olbison and Steve Hibbotson, once borrowed coach [[Jack Brownsword]]'s stop watch and had timed rallies around the Old Showground with the clubs vintage tractor.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 609}} On Keegan's turn the tractor crashed and the tractor's axle went through the engine.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 609}} The crash was very expensive to fix and the five were given a rollicking by manager Ron Ashman.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 609}} This experience gave Keegan awareness of his responsibility as a representative of Scunthorpe United.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 609}} Keegan made his debut against [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]] at the age of 17, making 29 league starts in his first season.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 660}} He became a regular in the first team by the [[1969\u201370 in English football|1969\u201370 season]], playing all 46 league games for the club.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 661}} This season saw the team reach the fifth-round of the [[FA Cup]], beating [[Football League First Division]] side [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] along the way. Keegan then missed only one game in his last season.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 661}} Earning a pittance, meant Keegan each summer had to find summer jobs; and each summer he would do jobs such as plate-laying at the [[Scunthorpe Steelworks|Appleby Frodingham Steelworks]].{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 600}}\n\n{{external media | float = right | width = 300px | video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/embed/S_KSWseOaaE?start=32&end=127 Keegan interviewed in 1969-70]}} Keegan played regularly in a [[playmaker|creative]] [[right midfield]] role for the Scunthorpe United first team despite his age \u2013 he scored 18 goals in 124 games for the club. After his first season he started attracting interest from higher division clubs. In one rare television interview of Keegan at Scunthorpe in 1969\u201370, Keegan tried to play down the interest, stating: \"I'm getting first-team football here. Should think if I went First Division, I'd struggle a bit.\"{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 665}} Not long after this interview, Keegan, noting other players had moved on to a higher level, began to feel impatient about moving on and Keegan even considered packing the game in and getting a full-time job if he did not get a move to a higher level.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 667\u2013672}} Higher division clubs such as Preston, Birmingham City, Notts County, Millwall and Arsenal all showed interest but nothing came of it.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 677}}\n\n===Liverpool (1971\u20131977)===\nIn 1971, he attracted the attention of [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]'s head scout [[Geoff Twentyman]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-fc/liverpool-fc-news/2009/08/07/liverpool-fc-super-scout-geoff-twentyman-s-secret-diary-revealed-100252-24338468/|title=Liverpool FC super-scout Geoff Twentyman's secret diary revealed| first= Tony |last = Barret| date = 7 August 2009|accessdate=29 April 2011|newspaper=Liverpool Echo}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Secret Diary of a Liverpool Scout| first=Simon |last=Hughes| date = 6 August 2009|publisher=Trinity Mirror Sport Media}}</ref> whose opinion was held in high regard by manager [[Bill Shankly]]. After Twentyman's recommendation, Liverpool made an offer for Keegan and this offer was accepted by Scunthorpe United.

In a reserve match against [[Tranmere Rovers]] Keegan, playing right midfield, and after playing a game with an attacking philosophy he was strongly warned by [[Ronnie Moran]] that he was ''\"playing too free and easy,\"'' and ''\"nearly playing up front.\"''{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 793\u2013799}} At one stage Keegan took Moran's criticism on board, took the criticism as a slight, and for a period perceived that Moran strongly had it in for him.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 800}} As a result of young Keegan's lack of positional discipline, Keegan was then tested upfront in a preseason reserve match against Southport.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 802}} Keegan scored both goals in a 2\u20131 victory.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 802}} This match was watched by Shankly.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 802}} Liverpool then tried Keegan in attack at Melwood in a game between the first team and the reserves.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 803}} Keegan played for the first team and scored 4 in a 7\u20130 victory.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 806}} His attacking play and ability prompted manager Bill Shankly to stop playing Keegan at right midfield and instead Shankly decided Keegan would be more effective upfront.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 793\u2013815}} After his first preseason at Liverpool Keegan was immediately deployed as the new strike partner for Toshack.<ref name=lfc>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolfc.com/history/past-players/kevin-keegan|title=Past Player Profile: Kevin Keegan|accessdate=10 August 2014|publisher=Liverpool F.C.}}</ref>\n\nThough Keegan did like Toshack as a teammate, Keegan never socialised with him off the pitch and Keegan maintained it was almost spooky how much they instantaneously could read each other's little and large game.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 869\u2013875}} In his career Keegan explained that the only player who reached that level of footballing understanding with him was England international [[Trevor Brooking]].{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 869\u2013875}}\n\nOn 14 August 1971, Keegan made his Liverpool debut against [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] at [[Anfield]], scoring after 12 minutes.{{sfnp|Keegan|1998|pp=83\u2013118}} Keegan made his debut at under-23 level later in 1971.

Liverpool, however, progressed to the FA Cup final. Their campaign in the competition had started with a tie against the club which had rejected Keegan, Doncaster Rovers, and it was Keegan who scored both Liverpool goals in a 2\u20132 draw. Liverpool won the replay and Keegan scored twice more on the way to [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]], including a lob-volley over the head of England colleague [[Peter Shilton]] in the semi-final against [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] at [[Villa Park]].\n\nIn the [[1974 FA Cup Final|1974 final]], Liverpool played Newcastle United. Keegan explained that Shankly's motivation was made easy after the pre-game talking by [[Malcolm Macdonald|Supermac]] (Malcolm Macdonald) and to a lesser extent [[John Tudor (footballer)|John Tudor]].{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 967\u2013989}} Tudor and Keegan's friend, Macdonald, gave interviews confidently proclaiming they had more ability whilst also being critical of older Liverpool pros such as Tommy Smith.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 967\u2013989}} Keegan also believed Shankly may have got into the heads of the Newcastle players when on the night before the game Shankly and [[Joe Harvey]] were being interviewed and Shankly was heard on the microphone, but off-camera, stating, ''\"Joe looks a bag of nerves...\"''{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 967\u2013989}} Keegan explained, knowing Shankly it would not surprise him if this was not an accident and Shankly knew what he was doing and that this statement was meant to neutralise any of Newcastle's confidence and that this did indeed rub off into the heads of some of the Newcastle players who became anxious.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 967\u2013989}} In the final, Keegan scored two as Liverpool beat [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] 3\u20130.<ref name=Kkeegan201103>{{cite web\n  | last = Keegan\n  | first = Kevin\n  | title = Liverpool v Newcastle\n  | publisher = shortlist.com\n  | date = 9 March 2011\n  | url = http://www.shortlist.com/entertainment/article/1098/liverpool-v-newcastle\n  | accessdate = 9 March 2011\n  | url-status = dead\n  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110311120510/http://www.shortlist.com/entertainment/article/1098/liverpool-v-newcastle\n  | archivedate = 11 March 2011\n  | df = dmy-all\n  }}</ref> It was the first brace in an FA Cup final since [[Mike Trebilcock]] scored twice for [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in 1966.

Leeds had decided to niggle at Liverpool, and in particular Keegan, in the match. In one instance [[Johnny Giles]] punched the unsuspecting Keegan and was reprieved after Keegan asked the referee to be lenient.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1094\u20131178}} Giles, after escaping a red card, then later lunged two-footed at Keegan.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1094\u20131178}} Upon Keegan's outraged reaction [[Billy Bremner]] challenged Keegan.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1094\u20131178}} Keegan then exploded and punched Bremner.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1094\u20131178}} Bremner punched back.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1094\u20131178}} They were sent off, the first time anyone had been sent off in a Charity Shield match.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1094\u20131178}} Both players removed their shirts in protest, with Keegan visibly shaken by the decision. Inside the Liverpool dressing room, Bremner approached Keegan to apologise and was met by the fury of Keegan's father who had come down to check on his son.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1094\u20131178}} They both received lengthy bans.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1094\u20131178}} The fight was shown that night on [[BBC]] television and both were fined \u00a3500, with Keegan being suspended for three games and Bremner eight.{{sfnp|Keegan|1998|pp=53\u201382}}  Despite this, Keegan, Bremner and Giles remained good friends outside of football.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1094\u20131178}}\n\nThe next year saw Keegan scoring goals and representing his club and country, but [[1974\u201375 in English football|1974\u201375]] was a trophyless season for Liverpool and England failed to qualify for the [[UEFA Euro 1976|European Championships]]. There were numerous honours for Keegan over the next two years, however, as Liverpool again won the League championship and UEFA Cup in [[1975\u201376 in English football|1975\u201376]]. Keegan scored in both legs of the UEFA Cup final against [[Club Brugge KV|FC Bruges]], having only scored once previously during Liverpool's run in the competition.{{sfnp|Keegan|1998|pp=53\u201382}}\n\nIn [[1976\u201377 Liverpool F.C. season|1976\u201377]], Keegan helped Liverpool get close to an unprecedented \"[[treble (association football)|treble]]\" of League championship, FA Cup and [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]], although midway through the season he announced his intention to leave in the summer to play abroad. Nevertheless, Keegan was irrepressible as Liverpool clinched the title and reached the finals of both Cup competitions. Keegan's last appearance in a Liverpool shirt on home soil saw Liverpool lose the FA Cup final to bitter rivals [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], ending the possibility of the treble.{{sfnp|Keegan|1998|pp=53\u201382}} The European Cup final in [[Rome]] against Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach was four days later. Keegan did not score, but he did make a late run which led to a foul inside the penalty area by [[Berti Vogts]]. This led to a penalty which was successfully converted by [[Phil Neal]], sealing a 3\u20131 win. In this season, on the 4 December 1976, Keegan's father, who had been suffering from cancer, died at the age of 71.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 352}}\n\nAfter 323 appearances and exactly 100 goals, Keegan left Liverpool. He had been made offers from clubs across Europe, and chose to join [[Hamburger SV]] in the West German [[Bundesliga]] for \u00a3500,000. Liverpool replaced him with [[Kenny Dalglish]].{{sfnp|Keegan|1998|pp=53\u201382}} Of his time in Liverpool, Keegan later said, \"The only thing I fear is missing an open goal in front of the [[Spion Kop (stadia)|Kop]].

In training he would not receive the ball after he made a run.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1248-1253}} Rules also stated that no club was allowed more than two foreign players, and unknowingly to Keegan he had also upset some of his new teammates as his move had indirectly moved out the three times European Cup winner [[Horst Blankenburg]].{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1260}} Blankenburg was a very popular member of the squad.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1260}} There was also a belief and a resentment amongst the players that the previous coach, who the players liked and did not think needed replacing, was replaced by Krohn, to accommodate Keegan.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1263-1267}} It was not until Keegan had moved out of temporary accommodation and moved to a bungalow in the little village of [[Itzstedt]] that Keegan began to feel he could make inroads and make a go of football and life in Germany.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1278}}\n\nIn one early interview Keegan mentioned how he was settling in. He explained how he missed British cereals that he could not find in the supermarkets in Germany. The Hamburg fans then flooded him with parcels of his favourite cereal with lists of the suppliers.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1321-1324}} There were language difficulties early on. In one instance in the summer, Keegan went into a hardware shop intending to buy a fuse and he eventually left the shop after buying Christmas lights.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1314}}\n\nHe scored in pre-season friendlies against [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] and former club Liverpool, but the club suffered defeat in the [[European Super Cup]] against the [[Merseyside]]rs. Keegan's time in Hamburg got off to a bad start. Keegan's first league match was against Duisburg and Hamburg lost 5-2. Rudi Gutendorf, the manager some believe was appointed for Keegan, would last until October.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1299-1305}}\n\nKeegan was sent off in a mid-season friendly against [[VfB L\u00fcbeck]] after knocking out an opposition player with a punch.{{sfnp|Keegan|1998|pp=147\u2013172}} In the winter break of his first season, and being isolated by the clique in the dressing room, frustrated Keegan played a friendly against lower league club L\u00fcbeck.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1332-1368}} A player in the match decided to target Keegan.

Although the club finished tenth in the league in [[1977\u201378 Bundesliga|1977\u201378]], Keegan's 12 goals helped him pick up a personal honour, the ''[[France Football]]'' [[Ballon d'Or|European Footballer of the Year]] award for 1978.{{sfnp|Keegan|1998|pp=147\u2013172}}<ref name=FF>{{cite web|url=http://www.francefootball.fr/ballon-d-or/Ballon_Or_2011/palmares.php|title=Ballon d'or|accessdate=10 August 2014|publisher=France Football|language=French|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812204919/http://www.francefootball.fr/ballon-d-or/Ballon_Or_2011/palmares.php|archivedate=12 August 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nHamburg appointed [[Branko Zebec]], a Yugoslav as a new coach.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1381}} Zebec was a man who was known to work players to the max.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1381}} Zebec's squad did a lot of running and Keegan claimed he had never been worked as hard in his life.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1386}} The [[1978\u201379 Bundesliga|1978\u201379 season]] saw a vast improvement on the club's 1978 finish.

In February in the 1979-80 season, Keegan announced he was leaving after his contract was up. One of the reasons for leaving was Zebec's training regime. Keegan had a lot of respect for Zebec,{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1522}} though Keegan also reasoned that Zebec's extreme fitness regime philosophy was flawed for the modern-day footballer.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1522-1527}} Keegan even told Zebec that his training regime would burn himself out as a footballer and that he believed he would be finished from playing by 30 if he continued.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1522-1527}} Zebec, in turn responded to Keegan's critique and explained to Keegan it was the same for all the players.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1522-1527}} Keegan then implied to Zebec that players have different roles and not all players run the same distances on match days; he pointed out to Zebec that because of his role and his effort, on match days not many players in the squad ran as much as himself.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1522-1527}} At Hamburg Keegan even doodled with a pen and paper what he thought of the training regime.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1522}} Keegan, as the metaphorical prisoner, drew a cartoon picture of Zebec in sunglasses, with he and his teammates doing press-ups, and then scribed Roman numerals conveying Keegan was counting down to his freedom. These drawings were left in his training ground locker. The drawings and Keegan's personal locker are now held in the Hamburg museum under the title 'HSV Legenden'{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1522}}\n\nHamburg's [[1979\u201380 European Cup|European campaign of 1979\u201380]] saw Keegan score two goals to help Hamburg past [[FC Dinamo Tbilisi|Dinamo Tbilisi]], Soviet champions who had beaten Liverpool to reach the latter stages.

Having negotiated a maximum transfer fee of \u00a3500,000 in his contract the year before and agreeing to a move in February, Keegan left Hamburg for [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] in the summer of 1980.{{sfnp|Keegan|1998|pp=173\u2013191}}\n\n===Southampton (1980\u20131982)===\nOn 11 February 1980, [[Lawrie McMenemy]] called a press conference at the Potters Heron hotel, [[Ampfield]] to announce that the European Footballer of the Year would be joining Southampton in the forthcoming summer.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1559-1573}} The news caused surprise throughout the world of football and around the city of [[Southampton]], as Southampton were a relatively small club.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1559-1573}} The club were beginning to become established in the top division, but this signing showed how persuasive their manager could be, especially when Keegan captained England in the [[UEFA Euro 1980|1980 European Championships]] in Italy.\n\nKeegan had a clause inserted into his contract when he joined Hamburg in 1977, giving Liverpool the option to buy him back.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1562}} Liverpool, however, opted not to exercise this clause when he returned to England three years later. As late as November 2011, Keegan has stated, \"I was with Lawrie [McMenemy] at a charity event the other day, and he said he phoned up Peter Robinson because he wanted me, but Liverpool had a clause. Peter said, 'No, we won't be signing him, definitely, we don't need him.'\" It was, therefore, Southampton boss Lawrie McMenemy who snapped him up for \u00a3420,000, and Keegan made his Southampton debut at [[Lansdowne Road]] in a pre-season friendly against [[Shamrock Rovers F.C.|Shamrock Rovers]] on 23 July 1980.\n\nKeegan's two seasons at [[The Dell (Southampton)|The Dell]] saw him as part of a flamboyant team also containing [[Alan Ball, Jr.|Alan Ball]], [[Phil Boyer]], [[Mick Channon]] and [[Charlie George]].{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1557-1559}} In [[1980\u201381 in English football|1980\u201381]] Saints scored 76 goals, finishing in sixth place, then their highest league finish.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1619}}\n\nIn the following season, Keegan was able to produce some of his best form and at the beginning of April 1982 Southampton sat at the top of the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] table,{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1619}} but a run of only three wins from the end of February meant a seventh-place finish,<ref>{{cite book | first1=Duncan |last1=Holley |first2=Gary |last2=Chalk | title=In That Number \u2013 A post-war chronicle of Southampton FC |page=167| isbn= }}</ref> 21 points off 1st place.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1619}} Despite this, Keegan was voted the [[PFA Player of the Year]] and awarded the [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] for services to Association Football.

Keegan, along with Terry McDermott, Jeff Clark and David McCreery, now had a senior status.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 2042-2046}} As a senior pro, his manager, Arthur Cox, who would later join many of Keegan's coaching teams when Keegan would later become a manager, had a different relationship to Keegan than with other players.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 2042-2046}} Cox would ask Keegan his opinion on players.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 2042-2046}}\n\nTo Keegan, Cox was a task master,{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2036}} with a good sense of humour.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2036}} Cox would condition the players like commandos by having Keegan and his teammates running up and down the hills in Gateshead.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 2047-2051}}\n\nIn his first season Newcastle finished fifth.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2042}} and Keegan maintained that after a faltering season, this position was a flattering league position.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2042}} Keegan, finished this season with 21 goals in 37 appearances and won North East Player of the Year.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2045}}\n\nIn September 1983, Keegan answered a phone call at 1:00 am from Arthur Cox.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 2076-2093}} In the phone call Cox explained to Keegan, sharply, he had signed a player called [[Peter Beardsley]] from [[Vancouver Whitecaps]] and explained to Keegan that he'd like him; after giving Keegan the message, Cox immediately put the phone down...{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 2076-2093}} A few days later Keegan met Beardsley at Benwell.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 2076-2093}} Keegan and his teammates, at first sight, thought Beardsley was just a lad who had won the competition to train with the first team.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 2076-2093}} It was only when they seen him in action that they knew he had something about him. At Beardsley's first training session Keegan could not believe his eyes at what a talent he was witnessing.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 2076-2093}} Keegan once stated about Beardsley, \"At Scunthorpe I always thought [[Terry Heath]] had the wow factor, because of his skill on the ball, and when I moved to Liverpool I had never seen anyone with [[Peter Thompson (footballer, born 1942)|Peter Thompson]]'s ability. By the time I started playing for Newcastle, however, I had played against Cruyff, [[Maradona]] and [[Pel\u00e9]], and yet I have never had my mind blown as I did on the first day I saw Peter Beardsley.\"{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 2076-2093}}\n\nKeegan announced his retirement prior to the end of the [[1983\u201384 in English football|1983\u201384 season]], on the 14 February 1984 - his 33rd birthday.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2137}} Keegan felt his career was finished after a cup game, a month prior, away at Liverpool.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2112-2134}} In this match Keegan was put through on goal from a through ball. This through ball had caught all the defenders flat-footed, left the defenders out of the equation, and left Keegan one on one with the keeper Bruce Grobbelaar.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2112-2134}} Keegan thought this was his moment to put Newcastle 1-0 up in front of the thousands of Newcastle fans behind the goal.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2112-2134}} Keegan who had been in a one on one with the goal keeper many times in training, and in football matches, felt, with his pace, with his experience in this position, it was second nature to finish the move.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2112-2134}} Keegan though was intercepted by the recovering [[Mark Lawrenson]]. As Keegan was moving towards goal with his pace, Lawrenson caught up to Keegan and stole the ball off him from the side. At this precise moment, it occurred to Keegan he had now lost his yard of pace.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2112-2134}} At the end of the game a frustrated Keegan, whilst clapping off the fans, had decided this would be his last season as a footballer.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2112-2134}}\n\nKeegan felt if he had have extended his career at Newcastle in the first division he would have had to adjust his game and move from the attacking role he had built his footballing identity on over the last 15 years of his career.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2137-2142}} Keegan did not want to extend his career by moving back into midfield in the first division with Newcastle.

Keegan who had stated that he would never enter football management, did carry out occasional work as a football pundit for British television.\n\n==International career==\nKeegan made his [[England national football team|England]] debut on 15 November 1972 in a 1\u20130 World Cup qualifying win over [[Wales national football team|Wales]]. Keegan appeared in only the two matches against Wales during this campaign as England failed to qualify for the [[1974 FIFA World Cup]].<ref name=ES>{{cite web|url=http://www.englandstats.com/playerreport.php?pid=557|title=Kevin Keegan|accessdate=30 July 2008|publisher=englandstats.com}}</ref>\n\nHe scored his first international goal in his third appearance, also against Wales, on 11 May 1974. He was given the captaincy by manager [[Don Revie]] in 1976 after [[Gerry Francis]] fell victim to a long term injury. He went on to captain England 31 times, retaining the captain's armband until his international retirement after the [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982 World Cup]].\n\nKeegan captained England at the [[UEFA Euro 1980|1980 Euros]]. England failed to progress from the group stage after finishing third in their group behind Italy and Belgium.\n\nHe managed only one World Cup appearance though, after England failed to qualify for both the [[1974 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)#Group 5|1974]] and [[1978 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)#Group 2|1978]] tournaments. He finally reached a [[1982 FIFA World Cup|World Cup in 1982]] when England got to the finals in Spain. He was named in the squad for the tournament, but was suffering from a chronic back injury and was unfit to play in all of England's group games. In a last, desperate effort to play in a World Cup (he knew that he would not be around for the 1986 competition) he secretly hired a car and drove from Spain to a [[medical specialist|specialist]] he knew in Germany for intensive treatment. He recovered sufficiently to appear as a substitute for the last 26 minutes of England's final second-round game against hosts [[Spain national football team|Spain]]. During this time he missed a point-blank header which would have broken the deadlock, in a game England needed to win to progress to the semi-finals. England drew the game 0\u20130 and were eliminated from the competition.\n\nFollowing the successful start to the [[1982\u201383 in English football|1982\u201383 season]] with Newcastle United, there was much controversy when newly appointed England manager [[Bobby Robson]] did not select Keegan for his first squad,<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TvFtlOSX_g | title = Match of the 80s \u2013 Season 82\u201383 (Part 1 of 4) | publisher = YouTube | date = 13 July 2007 | accessdate =27 August 2011}}</ref> a decision Keegan learned of from the media rather than Robson himself. Keegan publicly expressed his displeasure at not being given the courtesy of a phone call from Robson, and never played for his country again. He had won a total of 63 [[cap (sport)|caps]] and scored 21 goals.\n\n==Managerial career==\n===Newcastle United===\nOn 5 February 1992, almost eight years after his final game as a player, Keegan returned to football as manager of Newcastle United. They had been relegated from the [[Football League First Division|top flight]] in 1989 and narrowly missed out on promotion in 1990 after losing in the playoffs to arch-rivals [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], but in 1991 they had failed to make the playoffs and at several stages in [[1991\u201392 in English football|1991\u201392]], they had temporarily occupied bottom place in the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]]. Following the dismissal of previous manager [[Ossie Ardiles]], Keegan was appointed to prevent Newcastle from being relegated to the [[Football League Third Division|third tier]] of [[Football in England|English football]] for the first time. Keegan joined a club that still had participants from the old board room battles that had been going on at the club for decades.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=kindle location 2302-2314}} It has been argued the internal struggles from the former regime had held the club back.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=kindle location 2302-2314}} After three or more years trying, John Hall had recently won the board room from the old regime.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=kindle location 2302-2314}} Though John Hall was not yet confirmed as the chairman he had accrued enough power to make the key decisions.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=kindle location 2302-2314}} The board members belonging to the former regime were only told by John Hall, one hour before Keegan\u2019s first press conference that Kevin Keegan would be the manager.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=kindle location 2302-2314}} Keegan had only watched two live matches in seven years. One was the European Cup final in 1991 and the other being a Newcastle United 0-0 draw against Blackburn; as such, calls were made that suggested Keegan was unprepared and inexperienced.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2323-2341}} \n\nWhen Keegan turned up to Benwell for his first training session as manager, he noted the training ground was in a mess. Keegan was surprised at the timely neglect of the training ground facilities.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2353-2374}} The training was in the process of being sold, despite this, Keegan paid for the clean up of the training ground with of his own money,{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2353-2374}} with the cleaning work being done in one weekend.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2353-2374}} Keegan felt this clean up work was an important move and an indirect statement to the players that conveyed to the players that their professionalism, from now on, had to be high.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2353-2374}} Assessing the squad, Keegan opined that the squad was not good enough to reach the level he and McDermott once played at.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2380-2400}} In five-a-sides he and Terry Mcdermott, both in their 40s, with their lack of conditioning, believed they were two of the stand out players.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2380-2400}} Keegan noted the club had an impressive crop of youth players. This crop included: [[Lee Clark (footballer)|Lee Clark]], [[Steve Watson]], [[Steve Howey (footballer)|Steve Howey]], [[Alan Thompson (footballer, born 1973)|Alan Thompson]] and [[Robbie Elliott]].{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2380-2400}} These young players would form a core of players involved in Keegan's Newcastle squads from 1992 to 1997.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2380-2400}} Prior to his first game, Keegan made his first tough call with his squad of players when he dropped the midfielder Lee Clark.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2400-2405}} Though he liked Clark's spirit, Keegan believed he was at risk of being sent off.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2400-2405}} Keegan's first game, against Bristol City, ended in 3-0 victory in front of a capacity crowd.\n\nKeegan's managerial guidance in the 1991\u201392 season helped secure survival, which meant Newcastle United would play in the new Division One for the [[1992\u201393 in English football|1992\u201393 season]]. Chairman [[John Hall (businessman)|John Hall]] also promised Keegan millions of pounds to spend on new players after Keegan almost walked out on the club after a match, in the 1991\u201392 season, at home to [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] which was played on the 14 March 1992.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Turnbull|first1=Simon|title=Welcome to the North-east...

Newcastle began the season with 11 successive wins and led the league virtually all season, and the club record signing of [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] striker [[Andy Cole]] in February further strengthened their side; Cole netted 12 goals in his first 12 games for the club. The addition of [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]]'s [[Rob Lee]] bolstered the midfield in the autumn.\n\nNewcastle were promoted to the Premier League as Division One champions.\n\nTop scorer [[David Kelly (association footballer)|David Kelly]] and influential midfielder [[Gavin Peacock]] were both sold during the close season, and Keegan brought striker [[Peter Beardsley]] back to Newcastle from [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], six years after he had been sold by Newcastle to Liverpool.\n\n[[1993\u201394 in English football|1993\u201394]] was an enormous success for Newcastle as they finished third in the Premier League and qualified for the UEFA Cup, bringing European football to the club for the first time since the 1970s. Andy Cole was the Premier League's top scorer with 34 goals from 40 games, and managed a club record total of 41 goals in all competitions.\n\nKeegan then strengthened his side by signing [[Switzerland national football team|Swiss]] [[FIFA World Cup 1994|World Cup]] defender [[Marc Hottiger]] and [[Belgium national football team|Belgium's]] defensive midfielder [[Philippe Albert]], while [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]]'s quick winger [[Ruel Fox]] had arrived on transfer deadline day in March 1994.\n\nNewcastle won their first six games of the [[1994\u201395 in English football|1994\u201395 season]] to top the league and they appeared capable of winning their first league title since 1927. But the shock departure of Andy Cole to Manchester United in January weakened their attack, and finished the season sixth place in the final table; not enough for even another UEFA Cup campaign. In the meantime, autumn signing [[Paul Kitson]] partnered Beardsley in attack.\n\nKeegan made several important additions to the Newcastle side in the summer of 1995: [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] goalkeeper [[Shaka Hislop]], [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]]'s French winger [[David Ginola]], [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] striker [[Les Ferdinand]] and [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] defender [[Warren Barton]]. Ferdinand was Newcastle's biggest signing at \u00a36 million, while the \u00a34 million paid for Barton was the highest fee paid for a defender in English football at the time.\n\nNewcastle excelled in the first half of the [[1995\u201396 in English football|1995\u201396 season]], going ten points ahead on 23 December 1995 and holding a 12-point lead from early in January to 4 February. After a 2\u20130 defeat at [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] on 21 February, the lead was cut to nine points. A 1\u20130 defeat at the hands of fellow title challengers Manchester United cut the gap to a single point on 4 March, and within two weeks Newcastle's lead was overhauled and they were unable to recover it. Newcastle's [[Liverpool F.C. 4\u20133 Newcastle United F.C. (1996)|4\u20133 defeat]] to Liverpool on 3 April is widely considered<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/moslive/article-1300229/Premier-League-games-Ten-greatest.html|title=Ten of the greatest: Premier League games}}</ref> to be one of the classic Premier League games. With two games remaining Newcastle and Manchester United both had 76 points. Newcastle only got one point in a 1\u20131 drawn match against Nottingham Forest on 2 May, and with a 1\u20131 draw for Newcastle against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] on the final day of the season on 5 May, the title was won by United, whose 3\u20130 triumph at [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] would have won them the title regardless of Newcastle's result against Tottenham. Keegan stated in 2018 that if Newcastle United had won the title in that season, the squad, which included players such as [[Les Ferdinand]], [[Darren Peacock]], [[David Ginola]], [[Peter Beardsley]], [[Faustino Asprilla]] and [[Rob Lee]] would have stayed together, may have built up a momentum, and won more trophies.<ref name=etainers042018>{{cite web | url = https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/we-could-won-couple-more-14476551 | title = 'We could have won a couple more titles' \u2013 Kevin Keegan discusses Newcastle's Entertainers | last = McCormick | first = Sean | date = 2 April 2018 | work = Chronicle | location = Newcastle-upon-Tyne| access-date = 2 April 2018 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the race for the 1995\u201396 title, Keegan directed remarks at the Manchester United manager, [[Alex Ferguson|Sir Alex Ferguson]], during a post-match interview live on [[Sky Sports]].

A club statement following his resignation read:\n\n<blockquote>Newcastle United Football Club today announce the resignation of manager Kevin Keegan. Kevin informed the board of his wish to resign at the end of the season, having decided he no longer wishes to continue in football management at this stage in his life. Following lengthy discussions of which the board attempted to persuade Kevin to change his mind, both parties eventually agreed that the best route forward was for the club to, reluctantly, accept his resignation with immediate effect.</blockquote>\n\nKeegan left the club with a short statement reading:<blockquote>It was my decision and my decision alone to resign. I feel I have taken the club as far as I can, and that it would be in the best interests of all concerned if I resigned now.

The tribunal ruled in favour of Keegan, agreeing that Newcastle had [[constructive dismissal|constructively dismissed]] him by insisting on the signing of midfielder [[Ignacio Mar\u00eda Gonz\u00e1lez|Nacho Gonz\u00e1lez]] on loan (which was against his wishes) to replace [[James Milner]] following his move to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] and a bid for Bayern Munich's [[Bastian Schweinsteiger]] being rejected.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/incredible-story-newcastle-trying-sign-12813690|title = The incredible story of Newcastle trying to sign Schweinsteiger on the cheap \u2013 and Keegan quitting|first=Mark | last=Douglas |work=Evening Chronicle|date=29 March 2017|accessdate=7 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe ruling<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nufc.com/2009-10html/2009-10-02kk-vs-nufc.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128060800/http://www.nufc.com/2009-10html/2009-10-02kk-vs-nufc.html| archivedate=28 November 2010| title=KK v NUFC \u2013 the verdict|publisher=nufc.com|date=2 October 2009|accessdate=10 August 2014}}</ref> was based around seven issues. The panel declared that Keegan had been misled to believe he had the final decision on player transfers, and was never explicitly told in writing, his contract, or word of mouth that he did not or that his role would see him essentially report to others. Given the generally understood role of a Premiership manager, the panel agreed he could reasonably expect that this was not a factor. The club's signing of Gonz\u00e1lez meant that they had violated his employment contract, which amounted to constructive dismissal. While Gonz\u00e1lez was the main issue in the panel final decision, the club's alleged mistreatment of Keegan, claiming they were in a position to sack him should he have not agreed to the terms they offered him, as well as his decision to remain at the club until the 4 September instead of resigning on 1 September, allowing the club to reach a compromise, led to the panel ruling in Keegan's favour. Keegan was awarded \u00a32&nbsp;million (plus interest accrued) according to severance clauses in his contract, which the club never paid him after his departure. Claims for more were turned down on the basis that the standard contract severance clauses covered constructive dismissal, but he stated afterwards that the purpose of his claim had been to restore his reputation, and was delighted with the outcome, allowing him to move forward.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/n/newcastle_united/8286967.stm |work=BBC News  | title=Keegan wins \u00a32m Newcastle damages | date=2 October 2009 | accessdate=7 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn pursuit of winning the tribunal, the club admitted to misleading the media and their fans. Several key senior staff, including Dennis Wise and [[Derek Llambias]], had publicly claimed that Keegan had \"the final word\"; they claimed to the tribunal that this was not in fact the case and that their claims were just \"PR\". It was then revealed that Director of Football Dennis Wise asked Keegan to sign Gonz\u00e1lez by watching him \"on [[YouTube]]\". On 21 October, a subsequent meeting of the same panel found that the club should pay all legal and associated costs incurred by Keegan as a result of the tribunal. They reached this conclusion based on their view that the club's \"defence on the primary liability issue was, in our view, wholly without merit\".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11678_5642081,00.html | work=Sky Sports | title=Magpies must pay Keegan costs | date = 21 October 2009 | accessdate =3 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nKeegan stated after the hearing he still wants to manage in the top flight of football, and would consider returning to his position at the club, but feels the fans may be exhausted from his last tenure and would prefer him not to.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11678_5608630,00.html | work=Sky Sports | title=Keegan wants to manage again | date = 5 October 2009 | accessdate =3 March 2012 | first = Richard | last = Bailey}}</ref> In June 2013, Keegan stated he would only consider a return should owner Mike Ashley leave the club.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/kevin-keegan-labels-return-to-newcastle-as-an-absolute-living-nightmare-8648184.html | location=London | work=The Independent | title=Kevin Keegan labels return to Newcastle as 'an absolute living nightmare' | date=6 June 2013}}</ref> Keegan has continued to criticise Ashley, accusing him of a lack of respect for the fans.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/newcastle-united-news-kevin-keegan-3492049 | work=Daily Mirror | title=Kevin Keegan slams Newcastle owner Mike Ashley for showing 'a total lack of respect' to supporters | date = 3 May 2014 | accessdate =16 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2009, nearly a year after his departure from Newcastle, Keegan resurfaced after being confirmed as the lead pundit on [[ESPN (UK)|ESPN]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/aug/24/espn-premiership-kevin-keegan | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=ESPN signs Kevin Keegan to front its Premier League coverage | first=Mark | last=Sweney | date=24 August 2009 | accessdate=7 May 2010}}</ref> During the course of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]], Keegan featured as a pundit for [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]] broadcasts.
