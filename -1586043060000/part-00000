At this time it was owned by [[Edward Hudson (magazine owner)|Edward Hudson]], the owner of [[Lindisfarne Castle]] and various [[Edwin Lutyens|Lutyens]]-designed houses including [[The Deanery]] in [[Sonning]].    \n\nAt that time [[golf]] and [[horse racing|racing]] served as its main content, as well as the property coverage, initially of manorial estates, which is still such a large part of the magazine.  [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon]], the late Queen Mother, used to appear frequently on its front cover. Now the magazine covers a range of subjects in depth, from gardens and gardening to country house architecture, fine art and books, and property to rural issues, luxury products and interiors.   \n\nThe [[Book frontispiece|frontispiece]] of each issue usually features a portrait photograph of a young woman of society, or, on occasion, a man of society. For example; Volume 9, 1st June 1901 had Lady Fermor-Hesketh (the wife of [[Thomas George Fermor-Hesketh|7th Baronet of Rufford]]).<ref> {{google books|RFFOAAAAYAAJ|Country Life Illustrated, Volume 9, 1st June 1901|page=2}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, in its 119th year, Country Life was the subject of a three-part documentary series made by Spun Gold and which aired on BBC Two on consecutive Friday nights in March. The magazine has also celebrated its best-ever selling issue \u2013 the double issue from Christmas 2015 \u2013 and a 6th ABC increase in a row, which is an achievement no other weekly magazine publishing original content can claim.  \n\nIn 1997, the centenary of the magazine was celebrated by a special issue, the publishing of a book by Sir [[Roy Strong]], the airing of a BBC2 TV programme on a year in the life of the magazine, and staging a Gold Medal winning garden at the [[Chelsea Flower Show]]. In 1999, the magazine launched a new website.\n\nIn 2007, the magazine celebrated its 110th anniversary with a special souvenir issue on 4 January.<ref>[http://www.countrylife.co.uk/magazine/issue/903 Country Life, 4 January 2007, issue cover] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928000627/http://www.countrylife.co.uk/magazine/issue/903 |date=28 September 2011 }}</ref> Starting on Wednesday 7 May 2008 the magazine is issued each Wednesday, having been on sale each Thursday for the past 111 years, with the earlier day being achieved using electronic publishing technology.\n\n== Topics ==\n[[File:Mr Fox's Hunt Breakfast on Xmas Day.jpeg|thumb|[[Harry B. Neilson]]'s ''Mr Fox's Hunt Breakfast on Xmas Day'' (1897) appeared on the cover of ''Country Life'' in December 1997]]\nThe first several dozen pages of each issue are devoted to colour [[advertisements]] for upmarket residential property, which are one of the best-known attractions of the magazine, and popular with everyone from the super rich looking for a country house or estate to those who can only aspire to own such a property.\n\nThe magazine covers the pleasures and joys of [[rural]] life.  It is primarily concerned with rural communities and their environments as well as the concerns of country dwellers and [[landowner]]s and has a diverse readership which, although mainly UK based is also international.  Much of its success has historically been built on its coverage of [[country house]] architecture and gardening at a time when the architectural press largely ignored this building type. An extensive photographic archive has resulted, now of great importance to architectural historians.  \n\nThe other rural pursuits and interests covered include [[hunting]], [[shooting]], [[farming]], [[equestrianism|equestrian]] news and [[gardening]] and there are regular news and opinion pieces as well as a firm engagement with rural politics. There are reviews of [[book]]s, [[food]] and [[wine]], [[art]] and [[architecture]] (also many offers) and [[antique]]s and [[craft]]s.  Illustrative material includes the ''Tottering-by-Gently'' [[cartoon]] by [[Annie Tempest]].  The property section claims to have more prime agents than anywhere else. In addition. monthly luxury and interiors sections offer readers some informed ideas about the latest in jewellery, style and travel, and interiors. \n\nRecent feature articles have included [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] guest-editing an issue of ''Country Life'' in 2013, a historic revelation which revealed the true face of [[Shakespeare]] for the first time in 2015, and in 2016 an exclusive on where the [[Great Fire of London]] really began in 1666. There was a special commemorative issue in June 2016 on the occasion of the Queen's 90th birthday, and a Best of Britain celebrating the very best of what the [[United Kingdom]] has to offer, from craftsmen to landscapes.\n\n== BBC Documentary ==\nIn March 2016, ''Country Life'' was featured in a three-part documentary series produced by  Spun Gold which aired on BBC2 called ''Land of Hope and Glory, British Country Life''.

[[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon]], the late Queen Mother, used to appear frequently on its front cover. Now the magazine covers a range of subjects in depth, from gardens and gardening to country house architecture, fine art and books, and property to rural issues, luxury products and interiors.   \n\nThe [[Book frontispiece|frontispiece]] of each issue usually features a portrait photograph of a young woman of society, or, on occasion, a man of society. For example; Volume 9, 1st June 1901 had Lady Fermor-Hesketh (the wife of [[Thomas George Fermor-Hesketh|7th Baronet of Rufford]]).<ref> {{google books|RFFOAAAAYAAJ|Country Life Illustrated, Volume 9, 1st June 1901|page=2}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, in its 119th year, Country Life was the subject of a three-part documentary series made by Spun Gold and which aired on BBC Two on consecutive Friday nights in March. The magazine has also celebrated its best-ever selling issue \u2013 the double issue from Christmas 2015 \u2013 and a 6th ABC increase in a row, which is an achievement no other weekly magazine publishing original content can claim.  \n\nIn 1997, the centenary of the magazine was celebrated by a special issue, the publishing of a book by Sir [[Roy Strong]], the airing of a BBC2 TV programme on a year in the life of the magazine, and staging a Gold Medal winning garden at the [[Chelsea Flower Show]]. In 1999, the magazine launched a new website.\n\nIn 2007, the magazine celebrated its 110th anniversary with a special souvenir issue on 4 January.<ref>[http://www.countrylife.co.uk/magazine/issue/903 Country Life, 4 January 2007, issue cover] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928000627/http://www.countrylife.co.uk/magazine/issue/903 |date=28 September 2011 }}</ref> Starting on Wednesday 7 May 2008 the magazine is issued each Wednesday, having been on sale each Thursday for the past 111 years, with the earlier day being achieved using electronic publishing technology.\n\n== Topics ==\n[[File:Mr Fox's Hunt Breakfast on Xmas Day.jpeg|thumb|[[Harry B. Neilson]]'s ''Mr Fox's Hunt Breakfast on Xmas Day'' (1897) appeared on the cover of ''Country Life'' in December 1997]]\nThe first several dozen pages of each issue are devoted to colour [[advertisements]] for upmarket residential property, which are one of the best-known attractions of the magazine, and popular with everyone from the super rich looking for a country house or estate to those who can only aspire to own such a property.\n\nThe magazine covers the pleasures and joys of [[rural]] life.  It is primarily concerned with rural communities and their environments as well as the concerns of country dwellers and [[landowner]]s and has a diverse readership which, although mainly UK based is also international.  Much of its success has historically been built on its coverage of [[country house]] architecture and gardening at a time when the architectural press largely ignored this building type. An extensive photographic archive has resulted, now of great importance to architectural historians.  \n\nThe other rural pursuits and interests covered include [[hunting]], [[shooting]], [[farming]], [[equestrianism|equestrian]] news and [[gardening]] and there are regular news and opinion pieces as well as a firm engagement with rural politics. There are reviews of [[book]]s, [[food]] and [[wine]], [[art]] and [[architecture]] (also many offers) and [[antique]]s and [[craft]]s.  Illustrative material includes the ''Tottering-by-Gently'' [[cartoon]] by [[Annie Tempest]].  The property section claims to have more prime agents than anywhere else. In addition. monthly luxury and interiors sections offer readers some informed ideas about the latest in jewellery, style and travel, and interiors. \n\nRecent feature articles have included [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] guest-editing an issue of ''Country Life'' in 2013, a historic revelation which revealed the true face of [[Shakespeare]] for the first time in 2015, and in 2016 an exclusive on where the [[Great Fire of London]] really began in 1666. There was a special commemorative issue in June 2016 on the occasion of the Queen's 90th birthday, and a Best of Britain celebrating the very best of what the [[United Kingdom]] has to offer, from craftsmen to landscapes.\n\n== BBC Documentary ==\nIn March 2016, ''Country Life'' was featured in a three-part documentary series produced by  Spun Gold which aired on BBC2 called ''Land of Hope and Glory, British Country Life''. The films sought to show some elements of modern rural life which although feature often in ''Country Life'' magazine, are rarely seen in the mass media. \n\nTopics covered included the beauty of the countryside and the centuries and traditions of the people who live there as well as some of the challenges faced by those who live and work exclusively on the land, from property owners to farmers and those employed in country pursuits.\n\n== Editors ==\n* [[James Edmund Vincent]] 1897\u20131900\n* Peter Anderson Graham 1900\u20131925\n* W E Barber 1925\u20131933\n* [[Christopher Hussey]] 1933\u20131940 (previously Architectural Editor)\n* F Whitaker 1940\u20131958\n* John Adams 1958\u20131973\n* Michael Wright 1973\u20131984\n* [[Marcus Binney]] 1984\u20131986 (previously Architectural Editor)\n* Jenny Green 1986\u20131992\n* [[Clive Aslet]] 1993\u20132006 (previously Deputy Editor, now Editor-at-Large)\n* Mark Hedges 2006\u2013present\n\nDeputy editors:\n* [[Clive Aslet]] 1989\u20131993 (previously architectural editor)\n* [[Michael Hall (editor)|Michael Hall]] 1998\u20132004  (previously architectural editor, current editor of ''[[Apollo (magazine)|Apollo]]'')\n* [[Jessica Fellowes]] 2004\u20132008\n* Rupert Uloth 2008\u20132016\n* Kate Green 2016\u2013present\n\nArchitectural editors [dates as architectural writer]:\n* provisionally [[Edward Hudson (magazine owner)|Edward Hudson]] and James Edmund Vincent 1897\u20131900 / Peter Graham 1900\u20131907\n* [[Henry Avray Tipping]] 1907\u20131910, 1916\u20131930 [1930\u20131933]\n* Sir [[Lawrence Weaver]] 1910\u20131916\n* [[Christopher Hussey]] 1930\u20131933, 1940\u20131964 [1921\u20131930]\n* [[Arthur Oswald]] 1933\u20131940 [1928\u20131933, 1940\u20131969]\n* [[Mark Girouard]] 1964\u20131967 [c.1958\u20131964]\n* [[John Cornforth (historian)|John Cornforth]] 1967\u20131977 [c.1960\u20131967, 1977\u2013c.1990]\n* [[Marcus Binney]] 1977\u20131984 [1968\u20131977]\n* [[Clive Aslet]] 1984\u20131989 [1977\u20131984]\n* [[Giles Worsley]] 1989\u20131994 [1985\u20131988]\n* [[Michael Hall (editor)|Michael Hall]] 1994\u20131998 [1989\u20131994]\n* [[Jeremy Musson]] 1998\u20132007 [1995\u20131998]\n* [[Dr John Goodall]] 2007\u2013present\n\nGardens editors:\n* E.T.

Juicy J was also creating his own mixes by this time, but was not putting his raps on tapes just yet.\n\n=== The beginning (1991\u20131992) ===\nBy 1991, [[DJ Paul]], had already begun to make a name for himself in the local hip hop scene through DJing at local clubs, such as Club 380 Beale, where he got his first opportunity to perform. His mixtapes, which were gradually evolving to include more and more original content of \"Da Serial Killaz\", also helped spread word of his talents.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.memphisflyer.com/CallingtheBluff/archives/2013/04/11/q-and-a-with-dj-paul-of-three-6-mafia|title=Q & A with DJ Paul of Three 6 Mafia|last=Goggans|first=Louis|website=Memphis Flyer|language=en|access-date=2019-01-13}}</ref> At the time, the hip hop scene in Memphis had not taken a fully fledged form yet, but early works by artists such as DJ Spanish Fly and DJ Squeeky were hinting at what was to come. DJ Spanish Fly heard of Paul's production skills, and recruited him to help make a beat. Paul's work with Spanish Fly allowed him, at 14 years old, to quickly get his name out beyond the reach of his [[South Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee|South Memphis]] neighborhood, and into a more established circle of the Memphis hip hop scene.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.factmag.com/2013/11/27/the-essential-three-6-mafia/|title=The Essential... Three 6 Mafia|date=2013-11-27|website=FACT Magazine: Music News, New Music.|language=en-US|access-date=2019-01-13}}</ref> Meanwhile, [[Lord Infamous]] was still rapping and evolving his lyrical style. Up in [[North Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee|North Memphis]], [[Juicy J]] was slowly building a name for himself as well, now that he was making his own songs and distributing them with his mixtapes, as well as DJing at local clubs with his mentor.\n\nThat same year, DJ Paul and Juicy J first crossed paths after Juicy sought out Paul in 1991 for help making beats. The two quickly grew fond of each-other's musical styles and the two subsequently teamed up with Lord Infamous to form the group \"The Backyard Posse\". DJ Paul and Lord Infamous still continued work as \"Da Serial Killaz\" by themselves, and in 1992 released the first legitimate original recording to come out of the eventual Three 6 Mafia camp, \"Portrait of a Serial Killa\". Featuring dark beats by Paul and [[horrorcore]]-styled lyrics from Lord Infamous and DJ Paul, this tape is recognized in its raw form as a pioneering work of horrorcore hip hop. Juicy J in the meantime released his debut hard copy mixtape, ''Volume 5'', that same year, as well as his seminal track in its original form, \"Slob on My Knob\".\n\n=== Debut, ''Mystic Stylez'' and ''Chapter 1: The End'' (1993\u20131996)  ===\nThe first notable release from members of the group that dropped in 1993 was [[DJ Paul]] and [[Lord Infamous]]'s ''Come With Me to Hell'', which featured original forms of future Three 6 Mafia hits such as \"Tear da Club Up\" and \"Porno Movie\". Paul's \"DJ Paul Volume 12\" mixtape was also released at this time. That same year, while recording music for \"The Backyard Posse\", Lord Infamous rapped a line referring to his crew as the \"Triple Six Mafia\". The group later adopted the name, seeing that the name more closely matched the bleak and dark imagery of their music.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.26728/title.dj-paul-reflects-on-lord-infamous-career-founding-three-6-mafia|title=DJ Paul Reflects On Lord Infamous' Career & Founding Three 6 Mafia|last=http://hiphopdx.com|first=HipHopDX-|date=2013-12-22|website=HipHopDX|access-date=2019-01-13}}</ref>\n\n[[Juicy J]] had yet to release a notable work of his own at this point, but in 1994 that would change with ''Vol. 9: It's On'' and ''Vol. 10: Chronicles of the Juice Manne''. Similar to Paul and Infamous's works the previous year, these tapes featured what would turn out to be some of the framework of future hit songs.\n\nAlso in 1994, the group added its fourth official member, rapper [[Koopsta Knicca]] (Robert Cooper Phillips). Following the addition, the group released their first unified release with the mixtape ''[[Smoked Out, Loced Out]]'', which featured fellow budding local rappers [[Gangsta Blac]], Kingpin Skinny Pimp, [[Playa Fly|Lil Fly]], 211, K-9, Lil Glock and S.O.G. That same year, Koopsta Knicca recorded the original version of what would become his first solo album, ''Da Devil's Playground''.\n\n1994 also marked a significant milestone for the group, when Paul and Juicy, alongside local entrepreneur Nick Scarfo, formed [[Prophet Entertainment|Prophet]], their first imprint. Through the label, the \"Prophet Posse\" was created, which was a looser collective that consisted of several local Memphis rappers who associated closely with Paul and Juicy J and ultimately signed onto the label, but were not members of Triple 6 Mafia. It was at this time when Juicy J's older brother, [[Project Pat]], emerged with his debut, ''Solo Tape''.\n\nIn 1995 the group filled out when it officially added rappers [[Crunchy Black]] and [[Gangsta Boo]]. It was later this year when the group shifted its name to Three 6 Mafia and released their debut album ''[[Mystic Stylez]]'' through Prophet. The LP earned them widespread recognition and attention locally and in the southern underground hip hop scene, and as a result, Prophet landed a distribution deal with [[Select-O-Hits]]. The group's first song on the radio was \"Da Summa\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://uicradio.wordpress.com/2016/10/31/criminally-underrated-juicy-j-three-6-mafia/|title=Criminally Underrated: Juicy J & Three 6 Mafia|last=Ford|first=Brody|date=2016-10-31|website=UIC Radio|language=en|access-date=2019-01-13}}</ref>[[File:Three_6_Mafia_logo.jpg|left|thumb|Three 6 Mafia's logo, seen on every LP since [[Chapter 1: The End]]|240px]]\n\nIn 1996, the group released ''[[Chapter 1: The End]]'', their first non-[[lo-fi music]] record. At the helm of Prophet, DJ Paul and Juicy J would produce and release a handful of albums of some of the label's other acts, including Gangsta Blac's ''Can It Be?'' and Kingpin Skinny Pimp's ''King of Da Playaz Ball'' in 1996, and the Prophet Posse's [[Body Parts (Prophet Posse album)|''Body Parts'']] in 1998. At the end of 1996 however, DJ Paul and Juicy J had a fallout with Nick Scarfo and a lengthy legal lawsuit ensued between the two sides over Prophet. It was at this time when Paul and Juicy laid the framework for [[Hypnotize Minds]], their own independent label which would become the powerhouse for Three 6 Mafia music. In 1997, Three 6 Mafia and Hypnotize Minds inked a record label deal with [[Relativity Records|Relativity]] for distribution.\n\n=== ''Chapter 2: World Domination'' and ''When the Smoke Clears: Sixty 6 Sixty 1'' (1997\u20132000)  ===\nIn 1997, after forming [[Hypnotize Minds]], the group signed a deal with [[Sony Music|Sony]] and began working on what would become their first [[RIAA certification|RIAA certified]] album, ''[[Chapter 2: World Domination]]''. Polishing up their darker sound for a more palatable aesthetic while still retaining their authenticity, ''Chapter 2: World Domination'' went on to reach [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] Gold status, selling over 800,000 copies in America. The LP peaked at no. 40 on The Billboard Top 200. The LP included the club anthem \"Tear Da Club Up\". At this point in the group's evolution, [[DJ Paul]] and [[Juicy J]] began expanding their brand and focused on developing Hypnotize Minds. Along with Three 6 Mafia, they brought along several artists from Prophet in their transition to Hypnotize Minds, creating the \"Hypnotize Camp Posse\", the successor of the \"Prophet Posse\". Over the next few years, the new label would put out [[The Kaze]] (trio of Project Pat, M.C. Mack and Scan Man)'s ''Kamakazie: Timez Up'', [[Indo G]]'s, [[Angel Dust (Indo G album)|''Angel Dust'']], [[Gangsta Boo]]'s ''[[Enquiring Minds]]'' , [[Project Pat]]'s ''[[Ghetty Green]]'', and Hypnotize Camp Posse's self titled album (''[[Three 6 Mafia Presents: Hypnotize Camp Posse]]'').\n\nIn 1999, Tear Da Club Up Thugz, a subgroup of Three 6 Mafia members in the founding trio of DJ Paul, Juicy J, and Lord Infamous, released ''[[CrazyNDaLazDayz]]'', which is recognized as one of if not the first album made entirely in the \"[[crunk]]\" production style. The album included Juicy J\u2019s solo, \"Slob On My Knob\", and went on to be certified Gold by the RIAA. ''CrazyNDaLazDayz'' peaked at no. 18 on the Billboard Top 200 music chart. Later that year group member [[Koopsta Knicca]]\u2019s debut album, ''Da Devil's Playground: Underground Solo'', was released independently, though like all the Hypnotize Minds albums, was still produced by DJ Paul and Juicy J.\n\nIn 2000, the group soared to new heights in the crunk music genre, carried by their most 2nd successful LP, ''[[When the Smoke Clears: Sixty 6, Sixty 1]]''. The album went on to achieve RIAA Platinum status, a 1st for the group, and spawned the single \"[[Sippin' on Some Syrup]]\", which featured [[UGK]] and Project Pat.\n\n2000 represented a troubling year for the group. The Prophet Posse, which to this point had still been working closely with Hypnotize Minds in an auxiliary-type relationship, disbanded, and its members who had not made the transition to Hypnotize Minds ceased making music with Three 6 Mafia and the rest of Hypnotize Minds. Moreover, group member Koopsta Knicca was forced out of Three 6 Mafia due to ongoing legal issues which culminated with his 2000 robbery incarceration, which voided his contract with Sony and forbade him from recording with the group.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hiphopdx.com/editorials/id.3066/title.koopsta-knicca-a-tragic-loss-for-hip-hop|title=Koopsta Knicca: A Tragic Loss for Hip Hop|last=http://hiphopdx.com|first=HipHopDX-|date=2015-10-14|website=HipHopDX|access-date=2019-01-13}}</ref> Koopsta Knicca was notably absent from the album cover of ''When the Smoke Clears: Sixty 6 Sixty 1'' and music videos that accompanied tracks on the album due to his incarceration, despite still being a member of the group at the time of the album's release.\n\n=== ''Choices'' and ''Da Unbreakables'' (2001\u20132004) ===\n\nDespite losing [[Koopsta Knicca]] from its ranks and cutting ties officially with Prophet, Three 6 Mafia and Hypnotize Minds were still successful. In 2001, the group released the soundtrack to the [[DJ Paul]], [[Juicy J]] and [[Hypnotize Minds]]-produced film, ''Choices''. The soundtrack was released as a studio album and (''[[Choices: The Album]]''), kept the Three 6 name and [[Hypnotize Minds]] brand growing. Moreover, Juicy and Paul successfully positioned [[Project Pat]] to become the new star of Hypnotize Minds, with his 2001 LP ''[[Mista Don't Play: Everythangs Workin]]'' hitting #4 on the [[Billboard 200]] and being certified Gold by the RIAA, being thus far the only Three 6 Mafia affiliate or member to release a RIAA-certified solo album.\n2001 also saw [[Gangsta Boo]] leave Three 6 Mafia following the release of ''Choices: The Album'', citing a variety of reasons including group dynamics, religion, alleged financial mismanagement and her desire to pursue a solo career.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1451101/three-6-mafias-gangsta-boo-finds-god-becomes-lady-boo/|title=Three 6 Mafia's Gangsta Boo Finds God, Becomes Lady Boo|last=Archive-Soren-Baker|website=MTV News|language=en|access-date=2019-01-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vladtv.com/article/166455/gangsta-boo-reveals-why-she-left-three-6-mafia|title=EXCLUSIVE: Gangsta Boo Reveals Why She Left Three 6 Mafia and Hypnotize Minds|website=www.vladtv.com|access-date=2019-01-13}}</ref>\n\nIn 2002, Juicy J and DJ Paul re-released their remastered and dramatically updated \"Vol. 10\" and \"Vol. 16\" albums respectively as ''[[Chronicles of the Juice Man]]'', and ''[[Underground Volume 16: For da Summa]]''. These LPs represented their solo studio LP debuts and the last piece of some of their older sound, effectively giving way to full on Crunk.\n\nIn 2003, the latest incarnation of Three 6 Mafia, in DJ Paul, Juicy J, [[Lord Infamous]], and [[Crunchy Black]], released their album ''[[Da Unbreakables]]''. Spawning hit singles such as \"Ridin' Spinners\" and \"Testin' My Gangsta\", the album was a success, with the RIAA certifying it Gold by the RIAA. In 2004, Three 6 Mafia began to mobilize for what would become their domination over hip-hop. They were working on a sequel to their 2001 movie, with it another studio LP, and DJ Paul, Juicy J, and Hypnotize Minds's [[Frayser Boy]], were about to ink a deal with the directors of ''[[Hustle & Flow]]'' to write an original track for the film that would ultimately result in the group winning an Oscar.\n\n=== Academy Award, ''Choices II: The Setup'' and ''Most Known Unknown'' (2005\u20132006) ===\nDuring 2005, many members had left, and with that even more affiliates, but into the fold other acts such as [[Project Pat]], [[Frayser Boy]], and [[Lil Wyte]] cropped up as successes to keep the camp moving forward. This moving forward reached its zenith in 2005-06 for Three 6 Mafia, wherein they became superstars of hip-hop. Firstly, they dropped the sequel to their ''Choices'' movie, ''[[Choices II: The Setup]]'', and a studio album to go along with it that sold 400,000 copies. Secondly, they released their most commercially successful LP, ''[[Most Known Unknown]]'', which charted at #3 on the Top 200 and went on to sell 1,600,000 copies in the United States, becoming their second album to go Platinum in America and their best selling overall. The LP featured 3 successful singles: \"[[Side 2 Side]]\", \"[[Poppin' My Collar]]\", and \"[[Stay Fly]]\". \"Stay Fly\" is Three 6 Mafia's most commercially successful song, being certified Double Platinum in America. The song featured 8Ball & MJG and Young Buck. The song also peaked at no. 13 on the Billboard Hot 100 music charts. \"Poppin' My Collar\", the remix which featured Project Pat, was certified Platinum by the RIAA and peaked at no. 21 on the Billboard Top 100. Also in 2005, they released an additional film, the comedy, ''[[Clean Up Men]]''.\n\nThree 6 Mafia's rise came to a head in 2006 when they became the first hip hop group to win the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] with \"[[It's Hard out Here for a Pimp]]\" (which they co-wrote with Frayser Boy) as one of the theme songs for ''[[Hustle & Flow]]''. They were also the first hip hop group to perform at the ceremony, which they did with ''Hustle & Flow'' actress [[Taraji P. Henson]] reprising her chorus.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.xxlmag.com/news/latest-headlines/2006/03/three-6-mafia-wins-oscar/ |title = Three 6 Mafia and Hypnotize Minds Wins Oscar |publisher = xxxlmag.com}}</ref> It was the second hip hop song to win an Oscar, after [[Eminem]]'s \"[[Lose Yourself]]\" in 2002 from his film ''[[8 Mile (film)|8 Mile]]''.

The energy from DJ Paul, Juicy J, [[Crunchy Black]], and Frayser Boy's on-stage presence and acceptance speech was infectious, causing that year's Oscar host [[Jon Stewart]] to quip \"How come they're the most excited people here tonight?

In 1988, [[DJ Paul]], at age 11, was taking piano lessons, and his older brother,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VA8YeDULaUg|title=DJ Paul on 'Seed of 6ix' Consisting of Lord Infamous' Son and Paul's Nephew (Part 1)|date=16 December 2018|accessdate=14 September 2019}}</ref> [[Lord Infamous]], age 15, was a singer practicing bass and electric guitar. Paul could play piano and drums, Infamous sang and played bass and guitar. With that, the two would compose songs together.\n\nAt the same time, in [[North Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee]], [[Juicy J]], at age 13, was learning how to [[Disc jockey|DJ]] as well as rap. He had initially wanted to be a singer, but in the late 1980s and early 1990s he fell in love with the [[gangsta rap]] style, and he, like his future founding group members across town, wanted to make music like popular artists at the time such as [[N.W.A]]. and [[Geto Boys]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ap.swishersweets.com/outlaws/djpaul/|title=DJ Paul|last=admin|website=Swisher Sweets Artist Project|language=en-US|access-date=2019-01-13}}</ref>\n\nIn 1989, DJ Paul and Lord Infamous formed the duo \"Da Serial Killaz\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.26728/title.dj-paul-reflects-on-lord-infamous-career-founding-three-6-mafia|title=DJ Paul Reflects On Lord Infamous' Career & Founding Three 6 Mafia|last=http://hiphopdx.com|first=HipHopDX-|date=2013-12-22|website=HipHopDX|access-date=2019-01-13}}</ref> It was at this time they distributed their own mixtapes of popular songs at the time at school, and Lord Infamous had started rapping with his signature triple time flow. Juicy J was also creating his own mixes by this time, but was not putting his raps on tapes just yet.\n\n=== The beginning (1991\u20131992) ===\nBy 1991, [[DJ Paul]], had already begun to make a name for himself in the local hip hop scene through DJing at local clubs, such as Club 380 Beale, where he got his first opportunity to perform. His mixtapes, which were gradually evolving to include more and more original content of \"Da Serial Killaz\", also helped spread word of his talents.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.memphisflyer.com/CallingtheBluff/archives/2013/04/11/q-and-a-with-dj-paul-of-three-6-mafia|title=Q & A with DJ Paul of Three 6 Mafia|last=Goggans|first=Louis|website=Memphis Flyer|language=en|access-date=2019-01-13}}</ref> At the time, the hip hop scene in Memphis had not taken a fully fledged form yet, but early works by artists such as DJ Spanish Fly and DJ Squeeky were hinting at what was to come. DJ Spanish Fly heard of Paul's production skills, and recruited him to help make a beat. Paul's work with Spanish Fly allowed him, at 14 years old, to quickly get his name out beyond the reach of his [[South Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee|South Memphis]] neighborhood, and into a more established circle of the Memphis hip hop scene.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.factmag.com/2013/11/27/the-essential-three-6-mafia/|title=The Essential... Three 6 Mafia|date=2013-11-27|website=FACT Magazine: Music News, New Music.|language=en-US|access-date=2019-01-13}}</ref> Meanwhile, [[Lord Infamous]] was still rapping and evolving his lyrical style. Up in [[North Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee|North Memphis]], [[Juicy J]] was slowly building a name for himself as well, now that he was making his own songs and distributing them with his mixtapes, as well as DJing at local clubs with his mentor.\n\nThat same year, DJ Paul and Juicy J first crossed paths after Juicy sought out Paul in 1991 for help making beats. The two quickly grew fond of each-other's musical styles and the two subsequently teamed up with Lord Infamous to form the group \"The Backyard Posse\". DJ Paul and Lord Infamous still continued work as \"Da Serial Killaz\" by themselves, and in 1992 released the first legitimate original recording to come out of the eventual Three 6 Mafia camp, \"Portrait of a Serial Killa\". Featuring dark beats by Paul and [[horrorcore]]-styled lyrics from Lord Infamous and DJ Paul, this tape is recognized in its raw form as a pioneering work of horrorcore hip hop. Juicy J in the meantime released his debut hard copy mixtape, ''Volume 5'', that same year, as well as his seminal track in its original form, \"Slob on My Knob\".\n\n=== Debut, ''Mystic Stylez'' and ''Chapter 1: The End'' (1993\u20131996)  ===\nThe first notable release from members of the group that dropped in 1993 was [[DJ Paul]] and [[Lord Infamous]]'s ''Come With Me to Hell'', which featured original forms of future Three 6 Mafia hits such as \"Tear da Club Up\" and \"Porno Movie\". Paul's \"DJ Paul Volume 12\" mixtape was also released at this time. That same year, while recording music for \"The Backyard Posse\", Lord Infamous rapped a line referring to his crew as the \"Triple Six Mafia\". The group later adopted the name, seeing that the name more closely matched the bleak and dark imagery of their music.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.26728/title.dj-paul-reflects-on-lord-infamous-career-founding-three-6-mafia|title=DJ Paul Reflects On Lord Infamous' Career & Founding Three 6 Mafia|last=http://hiphopdx.com|first=HipHopDX-|date=2013-12-22|website=HipHopDX|access-date=2019-01-13}}</ref>\n\n[[Juicy J]] had yet to release a notable work of his own at this point, but in 1994 that would change with ''Vol. 9: It's On'' and ''Vol. 10: Chronicles of the Juice Manne''. Similar to Paul and Infamous's works the previous year, these tapes featured what would turn out to be some of the framework of future hit songs.\n\nAlso in 1994, the group added its fourth official member, rapper [[Koopsta Knicca]] (Robert Cooper Phillips). Following the addition, the group released their first unified release with the mixtape ''[[Smoked Out, Loced Out]]'', which featured fellow budding local rappers [[Gangsta Blac]], Kingpin Skinny Pimp, [[Playa Fly|Lil Fly]], 211, K-9, Lil Glock and S.O.G. That same year, Koopsta Knicca recorded the original version of what would become his first solo album, ''Da Devil's Playground''.\n\n1994 also marked a significant milestone for the group, when Paul and Juicy, alongside local entrepreneur Nick Scarfo, formed [[Prophet Entertainment|Prophet]], their first imprint. Through the label, the \"Prophet Posse\" was created, which was a looser collective that consisted of several local Memphis rappers who associated closely with Paul and Juicy J and ultimately signed onto the label, but were not members of Triple 6 Mafia. It was at this time when Juicy J's older brother, [[Project Pat]], emerged with his debut, ''Solo Tape''.\n\nIn 1995 the group filled out when it officially added rappers [[Crunchy Black]] and [[Gangsta Boo]]. It was later this year when the group shifted its name to Three 6 Mafia and released their debut album ''[[Mystic Stylez]]'' through Prophet. The LP earned them widespread recognition and attention locally and in the southern underground hip hop scene, and as a result, Prophet landed a distribution deal with [[Select-O-Hits]]. The group's first song on the radio was \"Da Summa\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://uicradio.wordpress.com/2016/10/31/criminally-underrated-juicy-j-three-6-mafia/|title=Criminally Underrated: Juicy J & Three 6 Mafia|last=Ford|first=Brody|date=2016-10-31|website=UIC Radio|language=en|access-date=2019-01-13}}</ref>[[File:Three_6_Mafia_logo.jpg|left|thumb|Three 6 Mafia's logo, seen on every LP since [[Chapter 1: The End]]|240px]]\n\nIn 1996, the group released ''[[Chapter 1: The End]]'', their first non-[[lo-fi music]] record. At the helm of Prophet, DJ Paul and Juicy J would produce and release a handful of albums of some of the label's other acts, including Gangsta Blac's ''Can It Be?'' and Kingpin Skinny Pimp's ''King of Da Playaz Ball'' in 1996, and the Prophet Posse's [[Body Parts (Prophet Posse album)|''Body Parts'']] in 1998. At the end of 1996 however, DJ Paul and Juicy J had a fallout with Nick Scarfo and a lengthy legal lawsuit ensued between the two sides over Prophet. It was at this time when Paul and Juicy laid the framework for [[Hypnotize Minds]], their own independent label which would become the powerhouse for Three 6 Mafia music. In 1997, Three 6 Mafia and Hypnotize Minds inked a record label deal with [[Relativity Records|Relativity]] for distribution.\n\n=== ''Chapter 2: World Domination'' and ''When the Smoke Clears: Sixty 6 Sixty 1'' (1997\u20132000)  ===\nIn 1997, after forming [[Hypnotize Minds]], the group signed a deal with [[Sony Music|Sony]] and began working on what would become their first [[RIAA certification|RIAA certified]] album, ''[[Chapter 2: World Domination]]''. Polishing up their darker sound for a more palatable aesthetic while still retaining their authenticity, ''Chapter 2: World Domination'' went on to reach [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] Gold status, selling over 800,000 copies in America. The LP peaked at no. 40 on The Billboard Top 200. The LP included the club anthem \"Tear Da Club Up\". At this point in the group's evolution, [[DJ Paul]] and [[Juicy J]] began expanding their brand and focused on developing Hypnotize Minds. Along with Three 6 Mafia, they brought along several artists from Prophet in their transition to Hypnotize Minds, creating the \"Hypnotize Camp Posse\", the successor of the \"Prophet Posse\". Over the next few years, the new label would put out [[The Kaze]] (trio of Project Pat, M.C. Mack and Scan Man)'s ''Kamakazie: Timez Up'', [[Indo G]]'s, [[Angel Dust (Indo G album)|''Angel Dust'']], [[Gangsta Boo]]'s ''[[Enquiring Minds]]'' , [[Project Pat]]'s ''[[Ghetty Green]]'', and Hypnotize Camp Posse's self titled album (''[[Three 6 Mafia Presents: Hypnotize Camp Posse]]'').\n\nIn 1999, Tear Da Club Up Thugz, a subgroup of Three 6 Mafia members in the founding trio of DJ Paul, Juicy J, and Lord Infamous, released ''[[CrazyNDaLazDayz]]'', which is recognized as one of if not the first album made entirely in the \"[[crunk]]\" production style. The album included Juicy J\u2019s solo, \"Slob On My Knob\", and went on to be certified Gold by the RIAA. ''CrazyNDaLazDayz'' peaked at no. 18 on the Billboard Top 200 music chart. Later that year group member [[Koopsta Knicca]]\u2019s debut album, ''Da Devil's Playground: Underground Solo'', was released independently, though like all the Hypnotize Minds albums, was still produced by DJ Paul and Juicy J.\n\nIn 2000, the group soared to new heights in the crunk music genre, carried by their most 2nd successful LP, ''[[When the Smoke Clears: Sixty 6, Sixty 1]]''. The album went on to achieve RIAA Platinum status, a 1st for the group, and spawned the single \"[[Sippin' on Some Syrup]]\", which featured [[UGK]] and Project Pat.\n\n2000 represented a troubling year for the group. The Prophet Posse, which to this point had still been working closely with Hypnotize Minds in an auxiliary-type relationship, disbanded, and its members who had not made the transition to Hypnotize Minds ceased making music with Three 6 Mafia and the rest of Hypnotize Minds. Moreover, group member Koopsta Knicca was forced out of Three 6 Mafia due to ongoing legal issues which culminated with his 2000 robbery incarceration, which voided his contract with Sony and forbade him from recording with the group.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hiphopdx.com/editorials/id.3066/title.koopsta-knicca-a-tragic-loss-for-hip-hop|title=Koopsta Knicca: A Tragic Loss for Hip Hop|last=http://hiphopdx.com|first=HipHopDX-|date=2015-10-14|website=HipHopDX|access-date=2019-01-13}}</ref> Koopsta Knicca was notably absent from the album cover of ''When the Smoke Clears: Sixty 6 Sixty 1'' and music videos that accompanied tracks on the album due to his incarceration, despite still being a member of the group at the time of the album's release.\n\n=== ''Choices'' and ''Da Unbreakables'' (2001\u20132004) ===\n\nDespite losing [[Koopsta Knicca]] from its ranks and cutting ties officially with Prophet, Three 6 Mafia and Hypnotize Minds were still successful. In 2001, the group released the soundtrack to the [[DJ Paul]], [[Juicy J]] and [[Hypnotize Minds]]-produced film, ''Choices''. The soundtrack was released as a studio album and (''[[Choices: The Album]]''), kept the Three 6 name and [[Hypnotize Minds]] brand growing. Moreover, Juicy and Paul successfully positioned [[Project Pat]] to become the new star of Hypnotize Minds, with his 2001 LP ''[[Mista Don't Play: Everythangs Workin]]'' hitting #4 on the [[Billboard 200]] and being certified Gold by the RIAA, being thus far the only Three 6 Mafia affiliate or member to release a RIAA-certified solo album.\n2001 also saw [[Gangsta Boo]] leave Three 6 Mafia following the release of ''Choices: The Album'', citing a variety of reasons including group dynamics, religion, alleged financial mismanagement and her desire to pursue a solo career.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1451101/three-6-mafias-gangsta-boo-finds-god-becomes-lady-boo/|title=Three 6 Mafia's Gangsta Boo Finds God, Becomes Lady Boo|last=Archive-Soren-Baker|website=MTV News|language=en|access-date=2019-01-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vladtv.com/article/166455/gangsta-boo-reveals-why-she-left-three-6-mafia|title=EXCLUSIVE: Gangsta Boo Reveals Why She Left Three 6 Mafia and Hypnotize Minds|website=www.vladtv.com|access-date=2019-01-13}}</ref>\n\nIn 2002, Juicy J and DJ Paul re-released their remastered and dramatically updated \"Vol. 10\" and \"Vol. 16\" albums respectively as ''[[Chronicles of the Juice Man]]'', and ''[[Underground Volume 16: For da Summa]]''. These LPs represented their solo studio LP debuts and the last piece of some of their older sound, effectively giving way to full on Crunk.\n\nIn 2003, the latest incarnation of Three 6 Mafia, in DJ Paul, Juicy J, [[Lord Infamous]], and [[Crunchy Black]], released their album ''[[Da Unbreakables]]''. Spawning hit singles such as \"Ridin' Spinners\" and \"Testin' My Gangsta\", the album was a success, with the RIAA certifying it Gold by the RIAA. In 2004, Three 6 Mafia began to mobilize for what would become their domination over hip-hop. They were working on a sequel to their 2001 movie, with it another studio LP, and DJ Paul, Juicy J, and Hypnotize Minds's [[Frayser Boy]], were about to ink a deal with the directors of ''[[Hustle & Flow]]'' to write an original track for the film that would ultimately result in the group winning an Oscar.\n\n=== Academy Award, ''Choices II: The Setup'' and ''Most Known Unknown'' (2005\u20132006) ===\nDuring 2005, many members had left, and with that even more affiliates, but into the fold other acts such as [[Project Pat]], [[Frayser Boy]], and [[Lil Wyte]] cropped up as successes to keep the camp moving forward. This moving forward reached its zenith in 2005-06 for Three 6 Mafia, wherein they became superstars of hip-hop. Firstly, they dropped the sequel to their ''Choices'' movie, ''[[Choices II: The Setup]]'', and a studio album to go along with it that sold 400,000 copies. Secondly, they released their most commercially successful LP, ''[[Most Known Unknown]]'', which charted at #3 on the Top 200 and went on to sell 1,600,000 copies in the United States, becoming their second album to go Platinum in America and their best selling overall. The LP featured 3 successful singles: \"[[Side 2 Side]]\", \"[[Poppin' My Collar]]\", and \"[[Stay Fly]]\". \"Stay Fly\" is Three 6 Mafia's most commercially successful song, being certified Double Platinum in America. The song featured 8Ball & MJG and Young Buck. The song also peaked at no. 13 on the Billboard Hot 100 music charts. \"Poppin' My Collar\", the remix which featured Project Pat, was certified Platinum by the RIAA and peaked at no. 21 on the Billboard Top 100. Also in 2005, they released an additional film, the comedy, ''[[Clean Up Men]]''.\n\nThree 6 Mafia's rise came to a head in 2006 when they became the first hip hop group to win the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] with \"[[It's Hard out Here for a Pimp]]\" (which they co-wrote with Frayser Boy) as one of the theme songs for ''[[Hustle & Flow]]''. They were also the first hip hop group to perform at the ceremony, which they did with ''Hustle & Flow'' actress [[Taraji P. Henson]] reprising her chorus.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.xxlmag.com/news/latest-headlines/2006/03/three-6-mafia-wins-oscar/ |title = Three 6 Mafia and Hypnotize Minds Wins Oscar |publisher = xxxlmag.com}}</ref> It was the second hip hop song to win an Oscar, after [[Eminem]]'s \"[[Lose Yourself]]\" in 2002 from his film ''[[8 Mile (film)|8 Mile]]''.

The energy from DJ Paul, Juicy J, [[Crunchy Black]], and Frayser Boy's on-stage presence and acceptance speech was infectious, causing that year's Oscar host [[Jon Stewart]] to quip \"How come they're the most excited people here tonight?

[http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/officer/communitymanagers/StaffCorps/Pages/CivilEngineerCorps(CEC).aspx] Several Civil Engineer Corps officers, primarily those serving during or around the time of World War 2, have held the rank of Vice Admiral, and one officer has held the 4 star rank of Admiral, but there are no current billets within the US Navy that require Civil Engineer Corps officers of either rank.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:CEC Insignia.jpg|thumb|WWII Naval Officers from the Civil Engineer Corps, Medical Corps, Dental Corps and Supply Corps assigned to Naval Construction Battalions had a Silver Seabee on their Corps insignia. ]]\n\nCivil engineers were employed by the Navy Department as early as 1827, when Mr. Loammi Baldwin was appointed to superintendent of the construction of dry docks at Boston and Norfolk.<ref name= \"CEC\"/> Prior to the passage of the Act of 2 March 1867 civil engineers were appointed by the Secretary, but under authority of that act they were to be commissioned by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate; they were appropriated for as part of the civil establishment at the several navy yards and stations under the control of the [[Bureau of Yards and Docks]] until 1870.<ref name= \"CEC\"/>   At that time their pay was regulated by section 3 of the Act of 15 July, 1870 that  \"fixed\" the annual pay of officers of the Navy on the active list.<ref name= \"CEC\"/>   Appropriations for their pay have been made since 1870 under the head of \"Pay of the Navy\".\n\nThe discretionary authority given to the President by the Statute of 3 March 1871, to determine and fix the relative rank of civil engineers was not exercised until the 24th of February 1881, when relative rank was conferred upon them and fixed as follows: One with the relative rank of captain ([[Captain (United States)|CAPT]]), two with that of commander ([[Commander|CDR]]), three with that of lieutenant-commander ([[lieutenant commander|LCDR]]), and four with that of lieutenant ([[lieutenant|LT]]).<ref name= \"CEC\"/>\n\nThe Navy Regulations for 1876 failed to list civil engineers among the staff officers of the Navy, and the uniform regulations for that year did not prescribe a uniform or a corps device for that class of officer. In 1881, after having had relative rank conferred upon them, civil engineers were instructed by Uniform Circular dated 24 August to wear the uniform of officers of the line with whom they had relative rank - omitting the star, but with the distinctive letters C.E. (Old English) embroidered in silver in the center.  The same letters to be similarly embroidered on frogs of epaulets.\n\nIn 1905, two crossed silver sprigs, each composed of two oak leaves and an acorn (sometimes called \"Crossed Bananas\"), was adopted as the insignia of the Civil Engineer Corps replacing the Old English letters C.E.  These were to be worn on the epaulets, shoulder straps and collar of the service coat.<ref name= \"CEC\"/>  While the pattern of this corps device remained the same, uniform regulations issued in 1919 specified that it was to be embroidered in gold instead of silver and worn on the sleeve of frock, evening dress, and blue service coats, above the gold lace strips, and on shoulder marks for white service coat and overcoat. By these same regulations the light blue cloth worn under the sleeve strips, and worn on the shoulder marks since 1899, was abolished as a distinction of the corps, however is still present in the light blue color of the stripes worn by enlisted, pay grades E-3 and below in the Navy's construction field.\n\nIn 1939 the CEC was composed of 126  active officers.  By [[VJ day]] that number had grown to only 200.  However, there were over 10,000 reservists providing the leadership of the Construction Battalions.<ref name= \"CEC\">History of the CEC, '''p. 18'''[https://www.navfac.navy.mil/content/dam/navfac/PDFs/history/history-of-the-civil-engineer-corps.pdf]</ref>\nIn December 1941 Admiral [[Ben Moreell]] proposed the creation of 3 Naval Construction Battalions.  A problem then confronted BuDocks, who would command the Construction Battalions? Naval regulations stated that military command of naval personnel was strictly limited to [[line officer]]s, yet BuDocks deemed it essential that these Construction Battalions be commanded by officers of the Civil Engineer Corp, who were trained in the skills required for construction work. The newly formed [[Bureau of Naval Personnel]] (BuPers), successor to the Navy's Bureau of Navigation, strongly opposed this transgression of [[Naval tradition]].  Admiral Moreell took the question personally to the [[Secretary of the Navy]], [[Frank Knox]], who, on 19 March 1942, gave authority for officers of the Civil Engineer Corps to exercise military authority over all officers and enlisted men assigned to construction units otherwise known as the [[Seabees]].  For those engineers assigned to the Seabees a silver Seabee was mounted to the center of the CEC crossed oak leaves insignia.  The Seabee logo incorporated the CEC insignia, with one on each arm of the Seabee, just above each glove.\n[[File:Capt. John N Laycock and Admiral Moreell.jpg|thumb|Capt. John N.

It's purpose was to enable the Marines to land on Tinian's beaches bordered by coral embankments up to 15 feet high.  Ten LVTs were modified using iron beams salvaged from a sugar factory on Saipan.  The  commanding  Marine General was skeptical of the design.  He ordered that a tank test one a hundred times before he would use it it combat.  The ramps not only stood up, but they allowed the Marines land where there were no defenses as a landing there had been  thought impossible.  So, the astonished Japanese were completely outflanked due to CEC engineering.\n\n===Naval Combat Demolition Units===\nOperational Naval Demolition Unit No. 1. was the very first USN \"demolitions\" unit.  In early May 1943, a two-phase \"Naval Demolition Project\" was directed by the [[Chief of Naval Operations]] \"to meet a present and urgent requirement\". The first phase began at Amphibious Training Base (ATB) [[Solomons, Maryland]] with the establishment of Operational Naval Demolition Unit No. 1. Six Officers and eighteen enlisted men reported from NTC Camp Peary dynamiting and demolition school, for a four-week course. Those Seabees, lead by  Lieutenant Fred Wise CEC, were immediately sent to participate in the [[invasion of Sicily]]. <ref name=\"Fane\"/><ref name=\"navysealmuseum.org\">{{cite web |url=https://www.navysealmuseum.org/about-navy-seals/seal-history-the-naval-special-warfare-story/seal-history-origins-of-naval-special-warfare-wwii |title=Seal History: Origins of Naval Special Warfare \u2013 WWII |website=Navy Seal Museum Archives |date= |accessdate=18 October 2017}}</ref> When the unit returned to [[Camp Peary]] most of the men were assigned to the new [[Naval Combat Demolition Units]] being formed there.   \n\nNaval Combat Demolition Units were led by junior CEC officers.<ref>Seabee online magazine- this week in Seabee History[http://seabeemagazine.navylive.dodlive.mil/2016/09/12/this-week-in-seabee-history-week-of-sept-11/]</ref>  There were over 200 NCDUs formed with all but five being reqresitioned for the UDTs.\n\n===UDTs===\n[[File:80-G-244701 Lt Crist, Lt Cmdr.

Lt. Thomas C.

He heard that Admiral Turner was interested in blasting coral and made contact.  The Admiral commissioned Lt. Crist with developing a method to blast coral under combat  conditions and staging qualified men in [[Pearl Harbor|Pearl]] to form a unit for that task.  Lt. Crist had staged 30 officers and 150  enlisted when the disaster at [[Battle of Tarawa|Tarawa]] happened.  With [[Battle of Kwajalein|Kwajalein]] the next operation Lt. Crist's 180 men were used to form UDT 1 and UDT 2.  Cmdr. E.D. Brewster (CEC) was selected to command UDT 1 and Lt Crist was picked for UDT 2.  That did not last as Admiral Connelly wanted a commander with combat experience.  So, Lt. Crist was made ops officer for team 2.  Upon returning to Hawaii Lt. Crist was named as the first Training Officer of the UDT  program.  He was in the position only a short time when he was selected as commander of UDT 3.  For the Marianas operation (Kwajelein, Roi-Namur, Siapan, Tinian, [[Eniwetok]], and Guam) Admiral Turner recommended sixty silver stars and over three hundred [[bronze star]]s with Vs for the Seabees and others of UDTs 1-7<ref name= \"Frogman\">\"America's First Frogman\", Elizabeth K.

[http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/officer/communitymanagers/StaffCorps/Pages/CivilEngineerCorps(CEC).aspx] Several Civil Engineer Corps officers, primarily those serving during or around the time of World War 2, have held the rank of Vice Admiral, and one officer has held the 4 star rank of Admiral, but there are no current billets within the US Navy that require Civil Engineer Corps officers of either rank.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:CEC Insignia.jpg|thumb|WWII Naval Officers from the Civil Engineer Corps, Medical Corps, Dental Corps and Supply Corps assigned to Naval Construction Battalions had a Silver Seabee on their Corps insignia. ]]\n\nCivil engineers were employed by the Navy Department as early as 1827, when Mr. Loammi Baldwin was appointed to superintendent of the construction of dry docks at Boston and Norfolk.<ref name= \"CEC\"/> Prior to the passage of the Act of 2 March 1867 civil engineers were appointed by the Secretary, but under authority of that act they were to be commissioned by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate; they were appropriated for as part of the civil establishment at the several navy yards and stations under the control of the [[Bureau of Yards and Docks]] until 1870.<ref name= \"CEC\"/>   At that time their pay was regulated by section 3 of the Act of 15 July, 1870 that  \"fixed\" the annual pay of officers of the Navy on the active list.<ref name= \"CEC\"/>   Appropriations for their pay have been made since 1870 under the head of \"Pay of the Navy\".\n\nThe discretionary authority given to the President by the Statute of 3 March 1871, to determine and fix the relative rank of civil engineers was not exercised until the 24th of February 1881, when relative rank was conferred upon them and fixed as follows: One with the relative rank of captain ([[Captain (United States)|CAPT]]), two with that of commander ([[Commander|CDR]]), three with that of lieutenant-commander ([[lieutenant commander|LCDR]]), and four with that of lieutenant ([[lieutenant|LT]]).<ref name= \"CEC\"/>\n\nThe Navy Regulations for 1876 failed to list civil engineers among the staff officers of the Navy, and the uniform regulations for that year did not prescribe a uniform or a corps device for that class of officer. In 1881, after having had relative rank conferred upon them, civil engineers were instructed by Uniform Circular dated 24 August to wear the uniform of officers of the line with whom they had relative rank - omitting the star, but with the distinctive letters C.E. (Old English) embroidered in silver in the center.  The same letters to be similarly embroidered on frogs of epaulets.\n\nIn 1905, two crossed silver sprigs, each composed of two oak leaves and an acorn (sometimes called \"Crossed Bananas\"), was adopted as the insignia of the Civil Engineer Corps replacing the Old English letters C.E.  These were to be worn on the epaulets, shoulder straps and collar of the service coat.<ref name= \"CEC\"/>  While the pattern of this corps device remained the same, uniform regulations issued in 1919 specified that it was to be embroidered in gold instead of silver and worn on the sleeve of frock, evening dress, and blue service coats, above the gold lace strips, and on shoulder marks for white service coat and overcoat. By these same regulations the light blue cloth worn under the sleeve strips, and worn on the shoulder marks since 1899, was abolished as a distinction of the corps, however is still present in the light blue color of the stripes worn by enlisted, pay grades E-3 and below in the Navy's construction field.\n\nIn 1939 the CEC was composed of 126  active officers.  By [[VJ day]] that number had grown to only 200.  However, there were over 10,000 reservists providing the leadership of the Construction Battalions.<ref name= \"CEC\">History of the CEC, '''p. 18'''[https://www.navfac.navy.mil/content/dam/navfac/PDFs/history/history-of-the-civil-engineer-corps.pdf]</ref>\nIn December 1941 Admiral [[Ben Moreell]] proposed the creation of 3 Naval Construction Battalions.  A problem then confronted BuDocks, who would command the Construction Battalions? Naval regulations stated that military command of naval personnel was strictly limited to [[line officer]]s, yet BuDocks deemed it essential that these Construction Battalions be commanded by officers of the Civil Engineer Corp, who were trained in the skills required for construction work. The newly formed [[Bureau of Naval Personnel]] (BuPers), successor to the Navy's Bureau of Navigation, strongly opposed this transgression of [[Naval tradition]].  Admiral Moreell took the question personally to the [[Secretary of the Navy]], [[Frank Knox]], who, on 19 March 1942, gave authority for officers of the Civil Engineer Corps to exercise military authority over all officers and enlisted men assigned to construction units otherwise known as the [[Seabees]].  For those engineers assigned to the Seabees a silver Seabee was mounted to the center of the CEC crossed oak leaves insignia.  The Seabee logo incorporated the CEC insignia, with one on each arm of the Seabee, just above each glove.\n[[File:Capt. John N Laycock and Admiral Moreell.jpg|thumb|Capt. John N.

It's purpose was to enable the Marines to land on Tinian's beaches bordered by coral embankments up to 15 feet high.  Ten LVTs were modified using iron beams salvaged from a sugar factory on Saipan.  The  commanding  Marine General was skeptical of the design.  He ordered that a tank test one a hundred times before he would use it it combat.  The ramps not only stood up, but they allowed the Marines land where there were no defenses as a landing there had been  thought impossible.  So, the astonished Japanese were completely outflanked due to CEC engineering.\n\n===Naval Combat Demolition Units===\nOperational Naval Demolition Unit No. 1. was the very first USN \"demolitions\" unit.  In early May 1943, a two-phase \"Naval Demolition Project\" was directed by the [[Chief of Naval Operations]] \"to meet a present and urgent requirement\". The first phase began at Amphibious Training Base (ATB) [[Solomons, Maryland]] with the establishment of Operational Naval Demolition Unit No. 1. Six Officers and eighteen enlisted men reported from NTC Camp Peary dynamiting and demolition school, for a four-week course.

He heard that Admiral Turner was interested in blasting coral and made contact.  The Admiral commissioned Lt. Crist with developing a method to blast coral under combat  conditions and staging qualified men in [[Pearl Harbor|Pearl]] to form a unit for that task.  Lt. Crist had staged 30 officers and 150  enlisted when the disaster at [[Battle of Tarawa|Tarawa]] happened.  With [[Battle of Kwajalein|Kwajalein]] the next operation Lt. Crist's 180 men were used to form UDT 1 and UDT 2.  Cmdr. E.D. Brewster (CEC) was selected to command UDT 1 and Lt Crist was picked for UDT 2.  That did not last as Admiral Connelly wanted a commander with combat experience.  So, Lt. Crist was made ops officer for team 2.  Upon returning to Hawaii Lt. Crist was named as the first Training Officer of the UDT  program.  He was in the position only a short time when he was selected as commander of UDT 3.

The span, opened in 1888, connects [[181st Street (Manhattan)|181st Street]] and [[Tenth Avenue (Manhattan)|Amsterdam Avenue]] in [[Washington Heights, Manhattan]], with University Avenue in [[Morris Heights, Bronx]]. It carries six lanes of traffic, as well as sidewalks on both sides. Ramps at either end of the bridge connect to the [[Trans-Manhattan Expressway]] and the [[Cross-Bronx Expressway]].\n\nThe bridge is operated and maintained by the [[New York City Department of Transportation]].

The bridge features steel-arch construction with two 510-foot-long (150m) main spans and masonry approaches. Construction began in 1886, and the bridge opened to pedestrian traffic on December 1, 1888. The plan had been to open the bridge to vehicular traffic on February 22, 1889&nbsp;\u2014 [[Washington's Birthday]] and the centennial anniversary of the first Presidency&nbsp;\u2014 but the full opening was delayed until December 1889.\n{{stack|[[Image:Detroit Photographic Company (0635).jpg|thumb|Washington Bridge and [[Harlem River Speedway]], early 20th century]]}}\nIn 1913, a young architect named John Bruns is reported to have jumped from the Washington bridge and lived.

Starting in the 1940s, ramps were built to connect the western end of the bridge to the [[178th-179th Street Tunnels|178th Street and 179th Street Tunnels]] leading to the George Washington Bridge. This allowed traffic to and from New Jersey to bypass the congested local streets of [[Upper Manhattan]].\n\nThe [[Alexander Hamilton Bridge]] was planned in the mid-1950s to provide a direct connection between [[Robert Moses]]'s proposed Trans-Manhattan and [[Cross-Bronx Expressway]]s and to accommodate the additional traffic resulting from the addition of the six-lane lower level to the George Washington Bridge.
