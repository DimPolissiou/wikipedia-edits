{"title_page": "Tiger ATV LTD", "text_new": "Tiger ATV, LTD was an independently owned ATV manufacturer founded in 1984, specializing in racing machines produced in low numbers. Estimates vary in the collector community, with production numbers ranging from as little as 300, to as many a 1000 units leaving the factory. An interview with R&D Manager Mickey Dunlap suggested that no more than 20 machines were produced in the winter of 1985/86, suggesting that the lower number is more accurate. Chassises were built in house, or in the case of the [[Tiger ATV LTD#Tiger KTM Powered 80cc ATC|Tiger 80]], heavily modified, and all bodywork were produced in-house, at their Burnsville, Minnesota facility, while drivetrains were provided By [[Bombardier Inc.|Rotax]] and [[KTM]]. Tiger produced ATC's for three years, but continued to support machines for several years after.\n\n{{Infobox company\n| name = Tiger ATV, LTD.\n| logo = \n| type = [[Private company limited by shares|Privately owned limited Company]]\n| traded_as =\n| founder = Peter Wood\n| foundation = {{start date and age|1984}}<br>Folded 1991\n| insolvency  =\n| location_city = [[Eagan, Minnesota|Eagan]], [[Minnesota]], [[United States|U.S.]]\n| key_people =\n| industry = [[Motorsport]]\n| products = [[Three-wheeler#All-terrain vehicles|All Terrain Vehicles]]\n| homepage = Defunct\n}}\n\nTiger began producing prototype machines as early as 1983, establishing a national dealer network and advertising campaign in 1984.

The engines were modified to produce significant increases in horsepower, and the frames modified both to accept the three wheeled configuration and handle the added horsepower. In ATC form, it produced an incredible 23hp factory delivered. The machines featured blue bodywork, seat and frame, and a KTM engine.

After settling in its new location, the name Gandara was given to it in commemoration of the former [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Governor General]] [[Jos\u00e9 de la G\u00e1ndara y Navarro]].\n\nThe municipality of Gandara is known for its products such as queseo, rice, rootcrops and peanuts exported in the entire region of Eastern Visayas and any point of the Philippine archipelago.\n\nGandara is the home also of the well-known corpse of Maria Diana Alvarez believed to be miraculous by the Gandare\u00f1os.\n[[File:Ma._Diana\u2019s_Chapel_in_Gandara,_Samar_(Home_of_the_miraculous_corpse_of_Maria_Diana_Alvarez).jpg|thumb|Ma. Diana\u2019s Chapel in Gandara, Samar (Home of the miraculous corpse of Maria Diana Alvarez)]]\n\n==History==\n\nDuring the 9th century, after the Mesopotamian exploration the Hindus explored the Cambaye Island, they bring [https://web.archive.org/web/20120804005759/http://www.anagrasarkalyan.gov.in/htm/gallery_wadi.html Sabai Grass] seedlings, Negritos and the Hindus help together to grow the Grass, when the grass are ripe enough they harvest it and sundried it, Sabai fibres were extracted from Sabai Grasses, they weave the dried grass and turn it into dresses by using a [[catgut]] as a weaver.\n\nOn the 13th century an Arabian-British explorer built and structured this sea farer guide from an Scree with the help of a Negrito inhabitants located nearby with China White as an ingredient as building material, it is lit with a Western Incandescent lamp and powered by a [[Baghdad Battery|Baghdad Carbon Cell]], the said battery is charged by sun at day.\n \nGand\u00e6ra's colonial past is evident from the solitary watchtower, the Friars returned after the remaining crew of Magellan came back from Spain, and situated along the Village called Dapdap and their Shrine called Tinago in 1596, and created a Cabecera called Catbalogan, and the Bangahon Church, the [[relic]]s of the church and fragmented artworks. Statues of saints are of numbers one of which is the St. Ni\u00f1o (An infant Child) a ''White'' statue carved from wood and being tell that it is a pair of the ''Black'' statue of the St. Ni\u00f1o of Cebu the Magellan remnants they called the Black and White saints. The White statue is being told that a clan \"Correche\" is now being held it privately. Townspeople quarried the stones from [[Napalisan]] cliff or scree carried to Dapdap and then formed and constructed the [[Tinago Shrine]] and the church from what they called ''Galut'' a clay or  ''[[Feldspar]], [[Kaolinite]]'' used to make a pot or in a pottery business in Bangahon for the church of Bangahon. These are remnants from the old Gand\u00e6ra, named Bangahon due to its geographical location in the forked of the Gandara River. \"''Ginbabanga han wala ug tuo nga salog''\". The book ''Conquistas de las Islas Filipinas'' by Gaspar de San Agustin the Bangahon states it was already a [[Pueblo]] or town in 1729, and was made a parish by the Spanish [[Jesuits]] [[Missionaries]] with [[St. Michael the Archangel]] as [[patron saint]].\n\nThe Eighteenth Century ended with Bangahon at the height of abundance and prosperity being a trading center complemented with its fertile soil producing plentiful and ample harvest every year. Potable water were carried from a balangay with a Natural Spring of Mineral Water now called San Agustin.  However, when the American battleships landed at Calbayog on February 9, 1902, the municipal officials of Bangahon prepared an occasion for the American soldiers. The American Scout then told the officials of this Marlboro that they will be donating a Bell and will constructed a school called Harvard Institute. The problem of where to build this landmark to become a new town was solved during a conference of July 25, 1903, at barrio San Pelayo but [[Dumalo-ong]] was unanimously chosen due to its ideal location being at the center and midway of the left river, right river and downstreams barrios. The bell or (Lingganay) a misfortune were carried by a barge and accidentally sunked{{typo help inline|reason=similar to sundek|date=November 2019}} and collide to it near an adobe rock formation before Bangahon going upstream along with the Bell. This bell was sequestered by the Americans on September 29, 1901 at [[Balangiga bells|Balangiga]]. Furthermore, the chosen site was located almost halfway between Calbayog City and Catbalogan City an ambient place for a Harvard Institute. Gand\u00e6ra's foundation anniversary is February the 29th.\n\nEstablished in February 29, 1904 and named after the surname of [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Spanish Governor General]] [[Jos\u00e9 de la G\u00e1ndara y Navarro]] as a respect by the American Soldier, the first captain was Jose Dionesio Mendiola, who died during the year's [[cholera]] epidemic and replaced by Jose Pichon on June 15, 1902, the contact of the American Scout not knowing were will be the bell will come from, nodding as his used attitude, served until June 15, 1903. Succeeded by Ramon Mendiola (1903\u20131906) who was remembered for celebrating the first Gand\u00e6ra town fiesta on September 28\u201329, 1904. From the year 1907, town executives were called Presidents. And the Reyes Clan as Royalty.\n\nThe town's new [[poblacion]] was built on some six hectares of farmland donated by Martino M. Reyes. The donation was executed on January 12, 1909. The school site covered by certificate of title no. 95 dated July 20, 1912, and that of the parish under lot no. 146-CAD-444-D dated August 31, 1914, further supported by an extra judicial donation dated March 20, 1915.\n\nArticle 960 dated October 23, 1923, transferred the jurisdiction of bara\u014bgays Bangon, Buenas Aires, Calanyugan, Cambaye, San Luis, Pangi and Pagsanghan to the Municipality of [[Tarangnan, Samar|Tarangnan]].\n\nDuring World War II, there are two Mayors in this municipality, Filadelfo Diaz Aliman for the Japanese Government and Teodoro Bisnar for the Philippine Government the [[Pulahanes]] (Pulajanes). During the war, the second waorld war, Japanese occupied this town and make the Gavaldon Building their headquarter, all Chinese traders, locals and their offspring were called and enslave them, making them a peasants. Japanese tell one Filadelfo Aliman that this maltreatment is a retaliation on their long aged war the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] and the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], they Chinese (sino) to fight back processed a seasoning called \"Vetsin\" (a powder from a snailshell or \u201c''tipaka han wawang nga ginpino\u201d''  in Waray that causes the illness called [http://www.globalnetwork.org/schistosomiasis schistosomiasis] and told the Filipino public that it is from the Japanese armies even its name is a Japanese word. The Japanese leave and promise and then will constructure a steel bridge value that makes them stand and be courageous because of the Filipino hospitality.\n\nIn December 6, 1987, San Jorge were created as a new municipality respectively out of Gandara. 42 barangays were dissolved by the town of San Jorge including the Gandare\u00f1os owner of Atigbang Senibaran (Villaleona) to the new town administration.\n\n==Barangays==\n\n[[File:Barangays of Gandara.png|thumb|280px|Barangays of Gandara]]\nGandara is politically subdivided into 69 [[barangay]]s, listed here with its Philippine Standard Geographic Code.\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n* Adela Heights ([[Poblacion]])\n* Arong\n* Balocawe\n* Bangahon\n* Beslig\n* Buao\n* Bunyagan\n* Burabod I ([[Poblacion]])\n* Burabod II ([[Poblacion]])\n* Calirocan\n* Canhumawid\n* Caparangasan\n* Caranas\n* Carmona\n* Casab-ahan\n* Casandig\n* Catorse De Agosto\n* Caugbusan\n* Concepcion\n* Diaz\n* Dumalo-ong ([[Poblacion]])\n* Elcano\n* Gerali\n* Gereganan\n* Giaboc\n* Hampton\n* Hetebac\n* Himamaloto\n* Hinayagan\n* Hinugacan\n* Hiparayan (Kinonongan)\n* Jasminez\n* Lungib\n* Mabuhay\n* Macugo\n* Malayog\n* Marcos\n* Minda ([[Poblacion]])\n* Nacube\n* Nalihugan\n* Napalisan\n* Natimonan\n* Ngoso\n* Palambrag\n* Palanas\n* Pi\u00f1aplata\n* Pizarro\n* Pologon\n* Purog\n* Rawis\n* Rizal\n* Samoyao\n* San Agustin\n* San Antonio\n* San Enrique\n* San Francisco\n* San Isidro (Dao)\n* San Jose\n* San Miguel\n* San Pelayo\n* San Ramon\n* Santa Elena\n* Santo Ni\u00f1o\n* Senibaran (Villa Leona)\n* Sidmon\n* Tagnao\n* Tambongan\n* Tawiran\n* Tigbawon\n\n==Climate==\n{{Weather box\n| location     = Gandara, Samar\n| width        = auto\n| metric first = Yes\n| single line  = Yes\n| Jan high C = 28\n| Jan low C  = 21\n| Feb high C = 29\n| Feb low C  = 21\n| Mar high C = 29\n| Mar low C  = 21\n| Apr high C = 31\n| Apr low C  = 22\n| May high C = 31\n| May low C  = 24\n| Jun high C = 30\n| Jun low C  = 24\n| Jul high C = 29\n| Jul low C  = 24\n| Aug high C = 29\n| Aug low C  = 25\n| Sep high C = 29\n| Sep low C  = 24\n| Oct high C = 29\n| Oct low C  = 24\n| Nov high C = 29\n| Nov low C  = 23\n| Dec high C = 28\n| Dec low C  = 22\n| Jan precipitation mm = 72\n| Feb precipitation mm = 52\n| Mar precipitation mm = 65\n| Apr precipitation mm = 62\n| May precipitation mm = 87\n| Jun precipitation mm = 129\n| Jul precipitation mm = 153\n| Aug precipitation mm = 124\n| Sep precipitation mm = 147\n| Oct precipitation mm = 157\n| Nov precipitation mm = 139\n| Dec precipitation mm = 117\n| Jan rain days        = 17.4\n| Feb rain days        = 13.4\n| Mar rain days        = 16.8\n| Apr rain days        = 18.0\n| May rain days        = 22.0\n| Jun rain days        = 25.3\n| Jul rain days        = 26.2\n| Aug rain days        = 24.2\n| Sep rain days        = 24.9\n| Oct rain days        = 26.0\n| Nov rain days        = 23.3\n| Dec rain days        = 20.8\n| source 1 = Meteoblue <ref name=\"met_norms\">\n{{cite web \n| url = https://www.meteoblue.com/en/weather/historyclimate/climatemodelled/gandara_philippines_1713262\n| title =  Gandara: Average Temperatures and Rainfall\n| publisher = Meteoblue\n| accessdate = 29 February 2020 }}</ref>\n| date = 29 February 2020 \n}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census \n| align= none\n| title= Population census of Gandara\n| 1903 = 12014\n| 1918 = 14320\n| 1939 = 18507\n| 1948 = 25048\n| 1960 = 24883\n| 1970 = 28307\n| 1975 = 30600\n| 1980 = 24764\n| 1990 = 23673\n| 1995 = 27263\n| 2000 = 28866\n| 2007 = 31222\n| 2010 = 31943\n| 2015 = 34434\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote = Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]] {{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\n\nBased on latest 2014 survey, the total population was 33,264, consisting of 17,046 males and 16,218 females.

They produce and consume by exchanging products to and from farm or towncenter, until a townfolk ''kadiong'' convinced them to put up a cooperative or a cooperation of Gandare\u00f1os\u2019 products to put up a bunk or a stockade and that cooperative will issue a bunknote to ease the trading of products or goods. Fellows can lend seeds or fishlings from the stockade, lenders now start with their own products and can be trade with the bunk/stockade or cooperative bunknotes. Bunknotes became rampant on the town and they decided to issue a paper and metal money as a bunknote. Products from different villages stocked at the bunk, and every village has a unique bunknote to signify their origins, aside from Bangahon were a calamity had happened they only had a few stocks but in their village that stock equivalent of a bunknote has a higher value, the village with the highest stocks is the reference stocks, their number of products divided by the reference stocks is the particular village bunknote equivalent in trading. Excess stocks in the bunk are used for the development of the town.\n\nThe cooperative is until now in service but has a different name, a bank and being run by lists of corporate stores within the town.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Allotment from the National Government Budget Management Office for Gandara was PHP 28,202,218 as of 2006.\n\n==Administrative Boundaries==\n\n===Aquatic Boundaries===\n*East 11.9935 North 124.6694 merge point of Santa Margarita, Calbayog, Tarangnan and Gandara, 10,241 meters West-Northwest of Napalisan (E 11.9895 / N 124.7305)\n*East 12.0049 / North 124.7597 between Santa Margarita and Gandera a river called Lambique-Hinagbungan River 5,521 meters Northeast of Napalisan, this river serves as a boundary between two municipalities, down to East 11.99120 / North 124.75106 of the said river 1,315 meters North of Tambongan.\n*East 11.9397 / North 124.7116 merge point of Tarangnan, Pagsanghan and Gandara, 8,909 meters South-Southwest of Napalisan (E11.9895/S\\N124.7305)\n*East 11.9723 / North 124.7532 between Pagsanghan and Gandara between an islet and an island called Cambaye and Caprangasan respectively 4,763 meters Southeast of Napalisan a river called Pagsanghan-Gandara River then to East 11.9601 / North 124.7136 midpoint of a river 881 meters East-Southeast of Lungib and 319 meters Northeast of Bangon Island a river boundary then to East 11.9710 / North 124.7265, 50 meters north of Palanas midpoint of Pagsanghan-Gandara River to the right where left is back to Caprangasan.

After settling in its new location, the name Gandara was given to it in commemoration of the former [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Governor General]] [[Jos\u00e9 de la G\u00e1ndara y Navarro]].\n\n==History==\n\nDuring the 9th century, after the Mesopotamian exploration the Hindus explored the Cambaye Island, they bring [https://web.archive.org/web/20120804005759/http://www.anagrasarkalyan.gov.in/htm/gallery_wadi.html Sabai Grass] seedlings, Negritos and the Hindus help together to grow the Grass, when the grass are ripe enough they harvest it and sundried it, Sabai fibres were extracted from Sabai Grasses, they weave the dried grass and turn it into dresses by using a [[catgut]] as a weaver.\n\nOn the 13th century an Arabian-British explorer built and structured this sea farer guide from an Scree with the help of a Negrito inhabitants located nearby with China White as an ingredient as building material, it is lit with a Western Incandescent lamp and powered by a [[Baghdad Battery|Baghdad Carbon Cell]], the said battery is charged by sun at day.\n \nGand\u00e6ra's colonial past is evident from the solitary watchtower, the Friars returned after the remaining crew of Magellan came back from Spain, and situated along the Village called Dapdap and their Shrine called Tinago in 1596, and created a Cabecera called Catbalogan, and the Bangahon Church, the [[relic]]s of the church and fragmented artworks. Statues of saints are of numbers one of which is the St. Ni\u00f1o (An infant Child) a ''White'' statue carved from wood and being tell that it is a pair of the ''Black'' statue of the St. Ni\u00f1o of Cebu the Magellan remnants they called the Black and White saints. The White statue is being told that a clan \"Correche\" is now being held it privately. Townspeople quarried the stones from [[Napalisan]] cliff or scree carried to Dapdap and then formed and constructed the [[Tinago Shrine]] and the church from what they called ''Galut'' a clay or  ''[[Feldspar]], [[Kaolinite]]'' used to make a pot or in a pottery business in Bangahon for the church of Bangahon. These are remnants from the old Gand\u00e6ra, named Bangahon due to its geographical location in the forked of the Gandara River. \"''Ginbabanga han wala ug tuo nga salog''\". The book ''Conquistas de las Islas Filipinas'' by Gaspar de San Agustin the Bangahon states it was already a [[Pueblo]] or town in 1729, and was made a parish by the Spanish [[Jesuits]] [[Missionaries]] with [[St. Michael the Archangel]] as [[patron saint]].\n\nThe Eighteenth Century ended with Bangahon at the height of abundance and prosperity being a trading center complemented with its fertile soil producing plentiful and ample harvest every year. Potable water were carried from a balangay with a Natural Spring of Mineral Water now called San Agustin.  However, when the American battleships landed at Calbayog on February 9, 1902, the municipal officials of Bangahon prepared an occasion for the American soldiers. The American Scout then told the officials of this Marlboro that they will be donating a Bell and will constructed a school called Harvard Institute. The problem of where to build this landmark to become a new town was solved during a conference of July 25, 1903, at barrio San Pelayo but [[Dumalo-ong]] was unanimously chosen due to its ideal location being at the center and midway of the left river, right river and downstreams barrios. The bell or (Lingganay) a misfortune were carried by a barge and accidentally sunked{{typo help inline|reason=similar to sundek|date=November 2019}} and collide to it near an adobe rock formation before Bangahon going upstream along with the Bell. This bell was sequestered by the Americans on September 29, 1901 at [[Balangiga bells|Balangiga]]. Furthermore, the chosen site was located almost halfway between Calbayog City and Catbalogan City an ambient place for a Harvard Institute. Gand\u00e6ra's foundation anniversary is February the 29th.\n\nEstablished in February 29, 1904 and named after the surname of [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Spanish Governor General]] [[Jos\u00e9 de la G\u00e1ndara y Navarro]] as a respect by the American Soldier, the first captain was Jose Dionesio Mendiola, who died during the year's [[cholera]] epidemic and replaced by Jose Pichon on June 15, 1902, the contact of the American Scout not knowing were will be the bell will come from, nodding as his used attitude, served until June 15, 1903. Succeeded by Ramon Mendiola (1903\u20131906) who was remembered for celebrating the first Gand\u00e6ra town fiesta on September 28\u201329, 1904. From the year 1907, town executives were called Presidents. And the Reyes Clan as Royalty.\n\nThe town's new [[poblacion]] was built on some six hectares of farmland donated by Martino M. Reyes. The donation was executed on January 12, 1909. The school site covered by certificate of title no. 95 dated July 20, 1912, and that of the parish under lot no. 146-CAD-444-D dated August 31, 1914, further supported by an extra judicial donation dated March 20, 1915.\n\nArticle 960 dated October 23, 1923, transferred the jurisdiction of bara\u014bgays Bangon, Buenas Aires, Calanyugan, Cambaye, San Luis, Pangi and Pagsanghan to the Municipality of [[Tarangnan, Samar|Tarangnan]].\n\nDuring World War II, there are two Mayors in this municipality, Filadelfo Diaz Aliman for the Japanese Government and Teodoro Bisnar for the Philippine Government the [[Pulahanes]] (Pulajanes).

They produce and consume by exchanging products to and from farm or towncenter, until a townfolk ''kadiong'' convinced them to put up a cooperative or a cooperation of Gandare\u00f1os\u2019 products to put up a bunk or a stockade and that cooperative will issue a bunknote to ease the trading of products or goods. Fellows can lend seeds or fishlings from the stockade, lenders now start with their own products and can be trade with the bunk/stockade or cooperative bunknotes. Bunknotes became rampant on the town and they decided to issue a paper and metal money as a bunknote. Products from different villages stocked at the bunk, and every village has a unique bunknote to signify their origins, aside from Bangahon were a calamity had happened they only had a few stocks but in their village that stock equivalent of a bunknote has a higher value, the village with the highest stocks is the reference stocks, their number of products divided by the reference stocks is the particular village bunknote equivalent in trading. Excess stocks in the bunk are used for the development of the town.\n\nThe cooperative is until now in service but has a different name, a bank and being run by lists of corporate stores within the town.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Allotment from the National Government Budget Management Office for Gandara was PHP 28,202,218 as of 2006.\n\n==Administrative Boundaries==\n\n===Aquatic Boundaries===\n*East 11.9935 North 124.6694 merge point of Santa Margarita, Calbayog, Tarangnan and Gandara, 10,241 meters West-Northwest of Napalisan (E 11.9895 / N 124.7305)\n*East 12.0049 / North 124.7597 between Santa Margarita and Gandera a river called Lambique-Hinagbungan River 5,521 meters Northeast of Napalisan, this river serves as a boundary between two municipalities, down to East 11.99120 / North 124.75106 of the said river 1,315 meters North of Tambongan.\n*East 11.9397 / North 124.7116 merge point of Tarangnan, Pagsanghan and Gandara, 8,909 meters South-Southwest of Napalisan (E11.9895/S\\N124.7305)\n*East 11.9723 / North 124.7532 between Pagsanghan and Gandara between an islet and an island called Cambaye and Caprangasan respectively 4,763 meters Southeast of Napalisan a river called Pagsanghan-Gandara River then to East 11.9601 / North 124.7136 midpoint of a river 881 meters East-Southeast of Lungib and 319 meters Northeast of Bangon Island a river boundary then to East 11.9710 / North 124.7265, 50 meters north of Palanas midpoint of Pagsanghan-Gandara River to the right where left is back to Caprangasan.

The verb \"to stream\" refers to the process of delivering or obtaining media in this manner;{{Clarify|date=May 2018}} the term refers to the delivery method of the medium, rather than the medium itself, and is an alternative to file [[downloading]], a process in which the end-user obtains the entire file for the content before watching or listening to it.\n\nA client end-user can use their [[media player (software)|media player]] to start playing [[digital video]] or [[digital audio]] content before the entire file has been transmitted. Distinguishing delivery method from the media distributed applies specifically to [[telecommunications network]]s, as most of the delivery systems are either inherently streaming (e.g. [[radio]], [[television]], streaming apps) or inherently non-streaming (e.g. [[books]], [[Videotape|video cassettes]], audio [[Compact Disc|CD]]s). For example, in the 1930s, [[elevator music]] was among the earliest popular music available as streaming media; nowadays [[Internet television]] is a common form of streamed media. The term \"streaming media\" can apply to media other than video and audio, such as live [[closed captioning]], [[ticker tape]], and [[real-time text]], which are all considered \"streaming text\".\n\n[[Live media|Live streaming]] is the delivery of [[Internet]] content in real-time much as [[live television]] broadcasts content over the airwaves via a television signal. Live internet streaming requires a form of source media (e.g. a video camera, an audio interface, screen capture software), an encoder to digitize the content, a media publisher, and a [[content delivery network]] to distribute and deliver the content. Live streaming does not need to be recorded at the origination point, although it frequently is.\n\nThere are challenges with streaming content on the Internet. For example, users whose Internet connection lacks sufficient [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] may experience stops, lags, or slow buffering of the content. And users lacking compatible hardware or software systems may be unable to stream certain content.\n\nSome popular streaming services include [[Netflix]], [[Hulu]], [[Prime Video]], the [[video sharing website]] [[YouTube]], and other sites which stream [[film]]s and [[television shows]]; [[Apple Music]] and [[Spotify]], which stream [[music]]; and [[video game live streaming]] sites such as [[Mixer (website)|Mixer]] and [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]].\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Internet video|Timeline of online video}}\n\nIn the early 1920s, [[George O. Squier]] was granted [[patent]]s for a system for the transmission and distribution of signals over electrical lines,<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.google.com/patents?id=5pV5AAAAEBAJ&dq=1641608| title = US Patent 1,641,608 | publisher = [[Google Patents]]}}</ref> which was the technical basis for what later became ''[[Muzak Holdings|Muzak]]'', a technology streaming continuous music to commercial customers without the use of [[radio]]. Attempts to display media on computers date back to the earliest days of computing in the mid-20th&nbsp;century. However, little progress was made for several decades, primarily due to the high cost and limited capabilities of computer hardware. From the late 1980s through the 1990s, consumer-grade personal computers became powerful enough to display various media. The primary technical issues related to streaming were having enough [[CPU]] power [[bus (computing)|bus]] [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] to support the required data rates, creating [[Latency (engineering)|low-latency]] interrupt paths in the [[operating system]] to prevent [[buffer underrun]], and enabling skip-free streaming of the content. However, computer networks were still limited in the mid-1990s, and audio and video media were usually delivered over non-streaming channels, such as by [[download]]ing a digital file from a remote server and then saving it to a local drive on the end user's computer or storing it as a digital file and playing it back from [[CD-ROM]]s. \n\nIn 1990 the first commercial [[Ethernet switch]] was introduced by [[Kalpana (company)|Kalpana]], which enabled the more powerful computer networks that lead to the first streaming video solutions used by schools and corporations. In the mid 1990s the [[World Wide Web]] was established, but streaming audio would not be practical until years later.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n===Multimedia compression===\n{{See|Data compression}}\n{{See also|Video coding format}}\n\nPractical streaming media was only made possible with advances in [[data compression]], due to the impractically high bandwidth requirements of uncompressed media. Raw [[digital audio]] encoded with [[pulse-code modulation]] (PCM) requires a bandwidth of 1.4{{nbsp}}[[Mbit/s]] for uncompressed [[CD audio]], while raw [[digital video]] requires a bandwidth of 168{{nbsp}}Mbit/s for [[SD video]] and over 1000{{nbsp}}Mbit/s for [[FHD]] video.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lee |first1=Jack |title=Scalable Continuous Media Streaming Systems: Architecture, Design, Analysis and Implementation |date=2005 |publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]] |isbn=9780470857649 |page=25 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7fuvu52cyNEC&pg=PA25}}</ref>\n\nThe most important compression technique that enabled practical streaming media is the [[discrete cosine transform]] (DCT),<ref name=\"Zhu\">{{cite book |last1=Ce |first1=Zhu |title=Streaming Media Architectures, Techniques, and Applications: Recent Advances: Recent Advances |date=2010 |publisher=IGI Global |isbn=9781616928339 |page=26 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cb4dWYVJ_8AC&pg=PA26}}</ref> a form of [[lossy compression]] first proposed in 1972 by [[N.

During the early 2000s, users had access to increased network [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], especially in the \"[[last mile]]\". \nThese technological improvements facilitated the streaming of audio and video content to computer users in their homes and workplaces.

In the age of digitization, the [[Private good|private consumption]] of music transformed into a [[Public good (economics)|public good]] largely due to one player in the market: Napster.\n\n[[Napster]], a [[peer-to-peer]] (P2P) file sharing network where users could upload and download [[MP3|mp3]] files freely, broke all music industry conventions when it launched in early 1999 out of Hull, Massachusetts. The platform was developed by Shawn and John Fanning as well as [[Sean Parker]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2013/09/05/ashes-to-ashes-peer-to-peer-an-oral-history-of-napster/|title=Ashes to ashes, peer to peer: An oral history of Napster|website=Fortune|language=en|access-date=2019-03-11}}</ref> In an interview from 2009, Shawn Fanning explained that Napster \u201c was something that came to me as a result of seeing a sort of an unmet need and the passion people had for being able to find all this music, particularly a lot of the obscure stuff which wouldn\u2019t be something you go to a record store and purchase, so it felt like a problem worth solving.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blog.sfgate.com/techchron/2009/05/31/an-interview-with-napsters-shawn-fanning/|title=An interview with Napster's Shawn Fanning|last=May 31|first=Benny Evangelista on|last2=PM|first2=2009 at 8:00|date=2009-06-01|website=The Technology Chronicles|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-11}}</ref>\n\nNot only did this development disrupt the music industry by making songs that previously required payment to acquire freely accessible to any Napster user, it demonstrated the power of P2P networks in turning any digital file into a public, shareable good. For the brief period of time that Napster existed, mp3 files fundamentally changed as a type of good. Songs were no longer financially excludable \u2013 barring access to a computer with internet access \u2013 and they were not rival, meaning if one person downloaded a song it did not diminish another user from doing the same. Napster, like most other providers of public goods, faced the problem of [[Free-rider problem|free riding]]. Every user benefits when an individual uploads an mp3 file, but there is no requirement or mechanism that forces all users to share their music. Thus, Napster users were incentivized to let others upload music without sharing any of their own files.\n\nThis structure revolutionized the consumer's perception of ownership over [[digital goods]] \u2013 it made music freely replicable. Napster quickly garnered millions of users, growing faster than any other business in history. At the peak of its existence, Napster boasted about 80 million users globally. The site gained so much traffic that many college campuses had to block access to Napster because it created network congestion from so many students sharing music files.<ref name=\"expertise1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.lifewire.com/history-of-napster-2438592|title=The History of Napster: Yes, It's Still Around|last=expertise|first=Mark Harris Brings music|last2=Producer|first2=Including a Background as a Music|website=Lifewire|language=en|access-date=2019-03-11|last3=composer|last4=Articles|first4=To Digital Music}}</ref>\n\nThe advent of Napster sparked the creation of numerous other P2P sites including [[LimeWire]] (2000), [[BitTorrent]] (2001), and [[the Pirate Bay]] (2003). The reign of P2P networks was short lived. The first to fall was Napster in 2001. Numerous lawsuits were filed against Napster by various record labels, all of which were subsidiaries of [[Universal Music Group]], [[Sony Music|Sony Music Entertainment]], [[Warner Music Group]], or [[EMI]]. In addition to this, the [[Recording Industry Association of America|Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA)]] also filed a lawsuit against Napster on the grounds of unauthorized distribution of copyrighted material, which ultimately led Napster to shutting down in 2001.<ref name=\"expertise1\"/> In an interview with Gary Stiffelman, who represents [[Eminem]], [[Aerosmith]], and [[TLC discography|TLC]], he explained why Napster was a problem for record labels: loss in revenue. In an interview with the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'', Stiffelman said, \u201cI\u2019m not an opponent of artists\u2019 music being included in these services, I'm just an opponent of their revenue not being shared.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/18/arts/record-labels-answer-to-napster-still-has-artists-feeling-bypassed.html|title=Record Labels' Answer to Napster Still Has Artists Feeling Bypassed|last=Strauss|first=Neil|date=2002-02-18|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-03-11|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n==== The fight for intellectual property rights: ''A&M Records, Inc. v.

It was argued on October 2, 2000 and was decided on February 12, 2001. The [[Appellate court|Court of Appeals]] for the Ninth Circuit ruled that a P2P file sharing service could be held liable for contributory and vicarious infringement of copyright, serving as a landmark decision for [[Intellectual property|intellectual property law]].<ref name=\"wustl1\">{{cite web|url=https://onlinelaw.wustl.edu/blog/case-study-am-records-inc-v-napster-inc/|title=Case Study: A&M Records, Inc. v.

Since Napster took no action to reduce infringement and financially benefited from repeated use, the Court ruled against the P2P site. The court found that \u201cas much as eighty-seven percent of the files available on Napster may be copyrighted and more than seventy percent may be owned or administered by plaintiffs.\u201d<ref name=\"cornell2001\"/>\n\nThe [[injunction]] ordered against Napster ended the brief period in which music streaming was a public good \u2013 non-rival and non-excludable in nature. Other P2P networks had some success at sharing mp3's, though they all met a similar fate in court. The ruling set the precedent that copyrighted digital content cannot be freely replicated and shared unless given consent by the owner, thereby strengthening the property rights of artists and record labels alike.<ref name=\"wustl1\"/>\n[[File:Music streaming platform use vs music piracy rates in U.S.png|thumb|As music streaming platforms have become more prevalent in the U.S., music piracy rates have fallen.

For example, one hour of digital video encoded at 300 kbit/s (this was a typical broadband video in 2005 and it was usually encoded in a 320 \u00d7 240 pixels window size) will be:\n(3,600 s \u00d7 300,000 bit/s) / (8\u00d71024\u00d71024) requires around 128 [[Megabyte|MB]] of storage.\n\nIf the file is stored on a server for on-demand streaming and this stream is viewed by 1,000&nbsp;people at the same time using a [[Unicast]] protocol, the requirement is 300 kbit/s \u00d7 1,000 = 300,000 kbit/s = 300 Mbit/s of bandwidth. This is equivalent to around 135&nbsp;[[gigabyte|GB]] per hour. Using a [[multicast]] protocol the server sends out only a single stream that is common to all users. Therefore, such a stream would only use 300&nbsp;kbit/s of serving bandwidth. See below for more information on these protocols. The calculation for live streaming is similar. Assuming that the seed at the encoder is 500 kbit/s and if the show lasts for 3 hours with 3,000 viewers, then the calculation is number of [[Megabyte|MB]]s transferred = encoder speed (in bit/s) \u00d7 number of seconds \u00d7 number of viewers / (8 \u00d7 1024 \u00d7 1024).

The video stream is compressed using a [[video coding format]] to make the file size smaller. Video coding formats include [[H.264]], [[High Efficiency Video Coding|HEVC,]] [[VP8]] or [[VP9]]. Encoded audio and video streams are assembled in a container \"[[bitstream]]\" such as [[MPEG-4|MP4]], [[Flash Video|FLV]], [[WebM]], [[Advanced Systems Format|ASF]] or [[Internet Streaming Media Alliance|ISMA]]. The bitstream is delivered from a streaming server to a streaming client (e.g., the computer user with their [[Internet]]-connected [[laptop]]) using a transport protocol, such as Adobe's [[Real Time Messaging Protocol|RTMP]] or [[Real-time Transport Protocol|RTP]]. In the 2010s, technologies such as Apple's [[HTTP Live Streaming|HLS]], Microsoft's Smooth Streaming, Adobe's HDS and non-proprietary formats such as [[MPEG-DASH]] have emerged to enable [[adaptive bitrate streaming]] over [[HTTP]] as an alternative to using proprietary transport protocols. Often, a streaming transport protocol is used to send video from an event venue to a \"[[Cloud computing|cloud]]\" transcoding service and CDN, which then uses HTTP-based transport protocols to distribute the video to individual homes and users.<ref>{{cite web|title = Streaming the London Olympic Games with the \"Go Live Package\" from iStreamPlanet and Haivision {{!}} iStreamPlanet|url = http://www.istreamplanet.com/casestudy/the-london-olympic-games-go-live-package/|website = www.istreamplanet.com|accessdate = 2015-11-11|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160101140531/http://www.istreamplanet.com/casestudy/the-london-olympic-games-go-live-package/|archive-date = 2016-01-01|url-status = dead}}</ref> The streaming client (the end user) may interact with the streaming server using a control protocol, such as [[Microsoft Media Server|MMS]] or [[Real Time Streaming Protocol|RTSP]].\n\nThe quality of the interaction between servers and users is based on the workload of the streaming service; as more users attempt to access a service, the more quality is affected unless there is enough bandwidth or the host is using enough proxy networks.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sripanidkulchai|first=Kunwadee|last2=Maggs|first2=Bruce|last3=Zhang|first3=Hui|date=2004|title=An Analysis of Live Streaming Workloads on the Internet|journal=Proceedings of the 4th ACM SIGCOMM Conference on Internet Measurement|series=IMC '04|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=41\u201354|doi=10.1145/1028788.1028795|isbn=9781581138214}}</ref>\u0e57 Deploying clusters of streaming servers is one such method where there are regional servers spread across the network, managed by a singular, central server containing copies of all the media files as well as the [[IP address]]es of the regional servers. This central server then uses [[Load balancing (computing)|load balancing]] and [[Scheduling (computing)|scheduling]] algorithms to redirect users to nearby regional servers capable of accommodating them. This approach also allows the central server to provide streaming data to both users as well as regional servers using [[FFMpeg]] libraries if required, thus demanding the central server to have powerful data-processing and immense storage capabilities. In return, workloads on the streaming backbone network are balanced and alleviated, allowing for optimal streaming quality.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Zhao |first1=Hong |last2=Chun-long |first2=Zhou |last3=Bao-zhao |first3=Jin |title=Design and Implementation of Streaming Media Server Cluster Based on FFMpeg |journal=The Scientific World Journal |date=3 February 2015 |volume=2015 |pages=963083 |doi=10.1155/2015/963083 |pmid=25734187 |pmc=4334929 }}</ref>\n\n==Protocol challenges==\nDesigning a network protocol to support streaming media raises many problems. [[Datagram]] protocols, such as the [[User Datagram Protocol]] (UDP), send the media stream as a series of small packets. This is simple and efficient; however, there is no mechanism within the protocol to guarantee delivery. It is up to the receiving application to detect loss or corruption and recover data using [[error correction]] techniques. If data is lost, the stream may suffer a [[Dropout (electronics)|dropout]]. The [[Real-time Streaming Protocol]] (RTSP), [[Real-time Transport Protocol]] (RTP) and the [[Real-time Transport Control Protocol]] (RTCP) were specifically designed to stream media over networks. RTSP runs over a variety of transport protocols, while the latter two are built on top of UDP.\n\nAnother approach that seems to incorporate both the advantages of using a standard web protocol and the ability to be used for streaming even live content is [[adaptive bitrate streaming]]. HTTP adaptive bitrate streaming is based on HTTP [[progressive download]], but contrary to the previous approach, here the files are very small, so that they can be compared to the streaming of packets, much like the case of using RTSP and RTP.<ref>Ch. Z. Patrikakis, N. Papaoulakis, Ch. Stefanoudaki, M. S. Nunes, \"Streaming content wars: Download and play strikes back\" presented at the Personalization in Media Delivery Platforms Workshop, [218 \u2013 226], Venice, Italy, 2009.</ref> Reliable protocols, such as the [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP), guarantee correct delivery of each bit in the media stream. However, they accomplish this with a system of timeouts and retries, which makes them more complex to implement. It also means that when there is data loss on the network, the media stream stalls while the protocol handlers detect the loss and retransmit the missing data. Clients can minimize this effect by buffering data for display. While delay due to buffering is acceptable in video on demand scenarios, users of interactive applications such as video conferencing will experience a loss of fidelity if the delay caused by buffering exceeds 200&nbsp;ms.<ref>Krasic, C. and Li, K. and Walpole, J., ''The case for streaming multimedia with TCP'', Lecture Notes in Computer Science, pages 213\u2013218, Springer, 2001</ref> \n[[File:Multicast stream.svg|thumb|Multicasting broadcasts the same copy of the multimedia over the entire network to a group of clients]]\n\n[[Unicast]] protocols send a separate copy of the media stream from the server to each recipient. Unicast is the norm for most Internet connections, but does not scale well when many users want to view the same [[television program]] concurrently. [[Multicast]] protocols were developed to reduce the server/network loads resulting from duplicate data streams that occur when many recipients receive unicast content streams independently. These protocols send a single stream from the source to a group of recipients. Depending on the network infrastructure and type, multicast transmission may or may not be feasible. One potential disadvantage of multicasting is the loss of [[video on demand]] functionality. Continuous streaming of radio or television material usually precludes the recipient's ability to control playback. However, this problem can be mitigated by elements such as caching servers, digital [[set-top box]]es, and buffered [[Media player (application software)|media players]].\n\n[[IP Multicast]] provides a means to send a single media stream to a group of recipients on a [[computer network]]. A multicast protocol, usually [[Internet Group Management Protocol]], is used to manage delivery of multicast streams to the groups of recipients on a LAN. One of the challenges in deploying IP multicast is that routers and firewalls between LANs must allow the passage of packets destined to multicast groups. If the organization that is serving the content has control over the network between server and recipients (i.e.,&nbsp;educational, government, and corporate [[intranet]]s), then routing protocols such as [[Protocol Independent Multicast]] can be used to deliver stream content to multiple [[Local Area Network]] segments. As in mass delivery of content, multicast protocols need much less energy and other resources, widespread introduction of reliable multicast (broadcast-like) protocols and their preferential use, wherever possible, is a significant ecological and economic challenge.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} [[Peer-to-peer]] (P2P) protocols arrange for prerecorded streams to be sent between computers. This prevents the server and its network connections from becoming a bottleneck. However, it raises technical, performance, security, quality, and business issues.\n\n==Applications and marketing==\n{{Expand section|date=December 2016}}\nUseful \u2013 and typical \u2013 applications of the \"streaming\" concept are, for example, long [[video lesson|video lectures]] performed \"online\" on the Internet.<ref>A typical one-hour [[video lesson|video lecture]] is the following \"live stream\" from an international conference on [[financial crisis|financial crises]]: [http://videolectures.net/eccs08_stanley_aosptucs/ /videolectures.net]</ref> An advantage of this presentation is that these lectures can be very long, although they can always be interrupted or repeated at arbitrary places. There are also new marketing concepts. For example, the [[Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra]] sells Internet live streams of whole concerts, instead of several [[CD]]s or similar fixed media, by their so-called \"[[Digital Concert Hall]]\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalconcerthall.com/|title=The Berliner Philharmoniker's Digital Concert Hall|website=Digital Concert Hall}}</ref> using [[YouTube]] for \"[[trailer (promotion)|trailing]]\" purposes only. These \"online concerts\" are also spread over a lot of different places \u2013 cinemas \u2013 at various places on the globe. A similar concept is used by the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in New York.

The verb \"to stream\" refers to the process of delivering or obtaining media in this manner;{{Clarify|date=May 2018}} the term refers to the delivery method of the medium, rather than the medium itself, and is an alternative to file [[downloading]], a process in which the end-user obtains the entire file for the content before watching or listening to it.\n\nA client end-user can use their [[media player (software)|media player]] to start playing [[digital video]] or [[digital audio]] content before the entire file has been transmitted. Distinguishing delivery method from the media distributed applies specifically to [[telecommunications network]]s, as most of the delivery systems are either inherently streaming (e.g. [[radio]], [[television]], streaming apps) or inherently non-streaming (e.g. [[books]], [[Videotape|video cassettes]], audio [[Compact Disc|CD]]s). For example, in the 1930s, [[elevator music]] was among the earliest popular music available as streaming media; nowadays [[Internet television]] is a common form of streamed media. The term \"streaming media\" can apply to media other than video and audio, such as live [[closed captioning]], [[ticker tape]], and [[real-time text]], which are all considered \"streaming text\".\n\n[[Live media|Live streaming]] is the delivery of [[Internet]] content in real-time much as [[live television]] broadcasts content over the airwaves via a television signal. Live internet streaming requires a form of source media (e.g. a video camera, an audio interface, screen capture software), an encoder to digitize the content, a media publisher, and a [[content delivery network]] to distribute and deliver the content. Live streaming does not need to be recorded at the origination point, although it frequently is.\n\nThere are challenges with streaming content on the Internet. For example, users whose Internet connection lacks sufficient [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] may experience stops, lags, or slow buffering of the content. And users lacking compatible hardware or software systems may be unable to stream certain content.\n\nSome popular streaming services include [[Netflix]], [[Hulu]], [[Prime Video]], the [[video sharing website]] [[YouTube]], and other sites which stream [[film]]s and [[television shows]]; [[Apple Music]] and [[Spotify]], which stream [[music]]; and [[video game live streaming]] sites such as [[Mixer (website)|Mixer]] and [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]].\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Internet video|Timeline of online video}}\n\nIn the early 1920s, [[George O. Squier]] was granted [[patent]]s for a system for the transmission and distribution of signals over electrical lines,<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.google.com/patents?id=5pV5AAAAEBAJ&dq=1641608| title = US Patent 1,641,608 | publisher = [[Google Patents]]}}</ref> which was the technical basis for what later became ''[[Muzak Holdings|Muzak]]'', a technology streaming continuous music to commercial customers without the use of [[radio]]. Attempts to display media on computers date back to the earliest days of computing in the mid-20th&nbsp;century. However, little progress was made for several decades, primarily due to the high cost and limited capabilities of computer hardware. From the late 1980s through the 1990s, consumer-grade personal computers became powerful enough to display various media. The primary technical issues related to streaming were having enough [[CPU]] power [[bus (computing)|bus]] [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] to support the required data rates, creating [[Latency (engineering)|low-latency]] interrupt paths in the [[operating system]] to prevent [[buffer underrun]], and enabling skip-free streaming of the content. However, computer networks were still limited in the mid-1990s, and audio and video media were usually delivered over non-streaming channels, such as by [[download]]ing a digital file from a remote server and then saving it to a local drive on the end user's computer or storing it as a digital file and playing it back from [[CD-ROM]]s. \n\nIn 1990 the first commercial [[Ethernet switch]] was introduced by [[Kalpana (company)|Kalpana]], which enabled the more powerful computer networks that lead to the first streaming video solutions used by schools and corporations. In the mid 1990s the [[World Wide Web]] was established, but streaming audio would not be practical until years later.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n===Multimedia compression===\n{{See|Data compression}}\n{{See also|Video coding format}}\n\nPractical streaming media was only made possible with advances in [[data compression]], due to the impractically high bandwidth requirements of uncompressed media.

During the early 2000s, users had access to increased network [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], especially in the \"[[last mile]]\". \nThese technological improvements facilitated the streaming of audio and video content to computer users in their homes and workplaces. There was also an increasing use of standard protocols and formats, such as [[Internet protocol suite|TCP/IP]], [[HyperText Transfer Protocol|HTTP]], [[HyperText Markup Language|HTML]] as the Internet became increasingly commercialized, which led to an infusion of investment into the sector. \n\nThe band [[Severe Tire Damage (band)|Severe Tire Damage]] was the first group to perform live on the Internet. On June&nbsp;24,&nbsp;1993, the band was playing a gig at [[PARC (company)|Xerox&nbsp;PARC]] while elsewhere in the building, scientists were discussing new technology (the [[Mbone]]) for broadcasting on the Internet using [[multicasting]]. As proof of PARC's technology, the band's performance was broadcast and could be seen live in Australia and elsewhere. In a March 2017 interview, band member Russ Haines stated that the band had used approximately \"half of the total bandwidth of the internet\" to stream the performance, which was a 152-by-76 pixel video, updated eight to twelve times per second, with audio quality that was \"at best, a bad telephone connection\".<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRa2pE5-Ny0 \"History of the Internet Pt. 1 \u2013 The First Live Stream\"].

In the age of digitization, the [[Private good|private consumption]] of music transformed into a [[Public good (economics)|public good]] largely due to one player in the market: Napster.\n\n[[Napster]], a [[peer-to-peer]] (P2P) file sharing network where users could upload and download [[MP3|mp3]] files freely, broke all music industry conventions when it launched in early 1999 out of Hull, Massachusetts. The platform was developed by Shawn and John Fanning as well as [[Sean Parker]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2013/09/05/ashes-to-ashes-peer-to-peer-an-oral-history-of-napster/|title=Ashes to ashes, peer to peer: An oral history of Napster|website=Fortune|language=en|access-date=2019-03-11}}</ref> In an interview from 2009, Shawn Fanning explained that Napster \u201c was something that came to me as a result of seeing a sort of an unmet need and the passion people had for being able to find all this music, particularly a lot of the obscure stuff which wouldn\u2019t be something you go to a record store and purchase, so it felt like a problem worth solving.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blog.sfgate.com/techchron/2009/05/31/an-interview-with-napsters-shawn-fanning/|title=An interview with Napster's Shawn Fanning|last=May 31|first=Benny Evangelista on|last2=PM|first2=2009 at 8:00|date=2009-06-01|website=The Technology Chronicles|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-11}}</ref>\n\nNot only did this development disrupt the music industry by making songs that previously required payment to acquire freely accessible to any Napster user, it demonstrated the power of P2P networks in turning any digital file into a public, shareable good. For the brief period of time that Napster existed, mp3 files fundamentally changed as a type of good. Songs were no longer financially excludable \u2013 barring access to a computer with internet access \u2013 and they were not rival, meaning if one person downloaded a song it did not diminish another user from doing the same. Napster, like most other providers of public goods, faced the problem of [[Free-rider problem|free riding]]. Every user benefits when an individual uploads an mp3 file, but there is no requirement or mechanism that forces all users to share their music. Thus, Napster users were incentivized to let others upload music without sharing any of their own files.\n\nThis structure revolutionized the consumer's perception of ownership over [[digital goods]] \u2013 it made music freely replicable. Napster quickly garnered millions of users, growing faster than any other business in history. At the peak of its existence, Napster boasted about 80 million users globally. The site gained so much traffic that many college campuses had to block access to Napster because it created network congestion from so many students sharing music files.<ref name=\"expertise1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.lifewire.com/history-of-napster-2438592|title=The History of Napster: Yes, It's Still Around|last=expertise|first=Mark Harris Brings music|last2=Producer|first2=Including a Background as a Music|website=Lifewire|language=en|access-date=2019-03-11|last3=composer|last4=Articles|first4=To Digital Music}}</ref>\n\nThe advent of Napster sparked the creation of numerous other P2P sites including [[LimeWire]] (2000), [[BitTorrent]] (2001), and [[the Pirate Bay]] (2003). The reign of P2P networks was short lived. The first to fall was Napster in 2001. Numerous lawsuits were filed against Napster by various record labels, all of which were subsidiaries of [[Universal Music Group]], [[Sony Music|Sony Music Entertainment]], [[Warner Music Group]], or [[EMI]]. In addition to this, the [[Recording Industry Association of America|Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA)]] also filed a lawsuit against Napster on the grounds of unauthorized distribution of copyrighted material, which ultimately led Napster to shutting down in 2001.<ref name=\"expertise1\"/> In an interview with Gary Stiffelman, who represents [[Eminem]], [[Aerosmith]], and [[TLC discography|TLC]], he explained why Napster was a problem for record labels: loss in revenue. In an interview with the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'', Stiffelman said, \u201cI\u2019m not an opponent of artists\u2019 music being included in these services, I'm just an opponent of their revenue not being shared.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/18/arts/record-labels-answer-to-napster-still-has-artists-feeling-bypassed.html|title=Record Labels' Answer to Napster Still Has Artists Feeling Bypassed|last=Strauss|first=Neil|date=2002-02-18|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-03-11|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n==== The fight for intellectual property rights: ''A&M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc.'' ====\nThe lawsuit ''[[A&M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc.]]'' fundamentally changed the way consumers interact with music streaming. It was argued on October 2, 2000 and was decided on February 12, 2001. The [[Appellate court|Court of Appeals]] for the Ninth Circuit ruled that a P2P file sharing service could be held liable for contributory and vicarious infringement of copyright, serving as a landmark decision for [[Intellectual property|intellectual property law]].<ref name=\"wustl1\">{{cite web|url=https://onlinelaw.wustl.edu/blog/case-study-am-records-inc-v-napster-inc/|title=Case Study: A&M Records, Inc. v.

Since Napster took no action to reduce infringement and financially benefited from repeated use, the Court ruled against the P2P site. The court found that \u201cas much as eighty-seven percent of the files available on Napster may be copyrighted and more than seventy percent may be owned or administered by plaintiffs.\u201d<ref name=\"cornell2001\"/>\n\nThe [[injunction]] ordered against Napster ended the brief period in which music streaming was a public good \u2013 non-rival and non-excludable in nature. Other P2P networks had some success at sharing mp3's, though they all met a similar fate in court. The ruling set the precedent that copyrighted digital content cannot be freely replicated and shared unless given consent by the owner, thereby strengthening the property rights of artists and record labels alike.<ref name=\"wustl1\"/>\n[[File:Music streaming platform use vs music piracy rates in U.S.png|thumb|As music streaming platforms have become more prevalent in the U.S., music piracy rates have fallen.

In 2018, however, music streaming revenue exceeded that of traditional revenue streams (e.g. record sales, album sales, downloads).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.ifpi.org/downloads/GMR2018.pdf|title=Global Music Report 2018: Annual State of the Industry|date=2017|work=GMR|access-date=|language=|issn=}}</ref> 2017 alone saw a 41.1% increase in streaming revenue alone and an 8.1% increase in overall revenue.<ref name=\":0\" /> Streaming revenue is one of the largest driving forces behind the growth in the music industry.

For example, one hour of digital video encoded at 300 kbit/s (this was a typical broadband video in 2005 and it was usually encoded in a 320 \u00d7 240 pixels window size) will be:\n(3,600 s \u00d7 300,000 bit/s) / (8\u00d71024\u00d71024) requires around 128 [[Megabyte|MB]] of storage.\n\nIf the file is stored on a server for on-demand streaming and this stream is viewed by 1,000&nbsp;people at the same time using a [[Unicast]] protocol, the requirement is 300 kbit/s \u00d7 1,000 = 300,000 kbit/s = 300 Mbit/s of bandwidth. This is equivalent to around 135&nbsp;[[gigabyte|GB]] per hour. Using a [[multicast]] protocol the server sends out only a single stream that is common to all users. Therefore, such a stream would only use 300&nbsp;kbit/s of serving bandwidth. See below for more information on these protocols. The calculation for live streaming is similar. Assuming that the seed at the encoder is 500 kbit/s and if the show lasts for 3 hours with 3,000 viewers, then the calculation is number of [[Megabyte|MB]]s transferred = encoder speed (in bit/s) \u00d7 number of seconds \u00d7 number of viewers / (8 \u00d7 1024 \u00d7 1024). The results of this calculation are as follows: number of [[Megabyte|MB]]s transferred = 500 x 1024 (bit/s) \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3,600 ( = 3 hours) \u00d7 3,000 (number of viewers) / (8 \u00d7 1024 \u00d7 1024) = 1,977,539 [[Megabyte|MB]]{{dubious|date=December 2019}}\n\n== Protocols ==\nThe audio stream is compressed to make the file size smaller using an [[audio coding format]] such as [[MP3]], [[Vorbis]], [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]] or [[Opus (audio format)|Opus]]. The video stream is compressed using a [[video coding format]] to make the file size smaller. Video coding formats include [[H.264]], [[High Efficiency Video Coding|HEVC,]] [[VP8]] or [[VP9]]. Encoded audio and video streams are assembled in a container \"[[bitstream]]\" such as [[MPEG-4|MP4]], [[Flash Video|FLV]], [[WebM]], [[Advanced Systems Format|ASF]] or [[Internet Streaming Media Alliance|ISMA]]. The bitstream is delivered from a streaming server to a streaming client (e.g., the computer user with their [[Internet]]-connected [[laptop]]) using a transport protocol, such as Adobe's [[Real Time Messaging Protocol|RTMP]] or [[Real-time Transport Protocol|RTP]]. In the 2010s, technologies such as Apple's [[HTTP Live Streaming|HLS]], Microsoft's Smooth Streaming, Adobe's HDS and non-proprietary formats such as [[MPEG-DASH]] have emerged to enable [[adaptive bitrate streaming]] over [[HTTP]] as an alternative to using proprietary transport protocols. Often, a streaming transport protocol is used to send video from an event venue to a \"[[Cloud computing|cloud]]\" transcoding service and CDN, which then uses HTTP-based transport protocols to distribute the video to individual homes and users.<ref>{{cite web|title = Streaming the London Olympic Games with the \"Go Live Package\" from iStreamPlanet and Haivision {{!}} iStreamPlanet|url = http://www.istreamplanet.com/casestudy/the-london-olympic-games-go-live-package/|website = www.istreamplanet.com|accessdate = 2015-11-11|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160101140531/http://www.istreamplanet.com/casestudy/the-london-olympic-games-go-live-package/|archive-date = 2016-01-01|url-status = dead}}</ref> The streaming client (the end user) may interact with the streaming server using a control protocol, such as [[Microsoft Media Server|MMS]] or [[Real Time Streaming Protocol|RTSP]].\n\nThe quality of the interaction between servers and users is based on the workload of the streaming service; as more users attempt to access a service, the more quality is affected unless there is enough bandwidth or the host is using enough proxy networks.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sripanidkulchai|first=Kunwadee|last2=Maggs|first2=Bruce|last3=Zhang|first3=Hui|date=2004|title=An Analysis of Live Streaming Workloads on the Internet|journal=Proceedings of the 4th ACM SIGCOMM Conference on Internet Measurement|series=IMC '04|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=41\u201354|doi=10.1145/1028788.1028795|isbn=9781581138214}}</ref>\u0e57 Deploying clusters of streaming servers is one such method where there are regional servers spread across the network, managed by a singular, central server containing copies of all the media files as well as the [[IP address]]es of the regional servers. This central server then uses [[Load balancing (computing)|load balancing]] and [[Scheduling (computing)|scheduling]] algorithms to redirect users to nearby regional servers capable of accommodating them. This approach also allows the central server to provide streaming data to both users as well as regional servers using [[FFMpeg]] libraries if required, thus demanding the central server to have powerful data-processing and immense storage capabilities. In return, workloads on the streaming backbone network are balanced and alleviated, allowing for optimal streaming quality.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Zhao |first1=Hong |last2=Chun-long |first2=Zhou |last3=Bao-zhao |first3=Jin |title=Design and Implementation of Streaming Media Server Cluster Based on FFMpeg |journal=The Scientific World Journal |date=3 February 2015 |volume=2015 |pages=963083 |doi=10.1155/2015/963083 |pmid=25734187 |pmc=4334929 }}</ref>\n\n==Protocol challenges==\nDesigning a network protocol to support streaming media raises many problems. [[Datagram]] protocols, such as the [[User Datagram Protocol]] (UDP), send the media stream as a series of small packets. This is simple and efficient; however, there is no mechanism within the protocol to guarantee delivery. It is up to the receiving application to detect loss or corruption and recover data using [[error correction]] techniques. If data is lost, the stream may suffer a [[Dropout (electronics)|dropout]]. The [[Real-time Streaming Protocol]] (RTSP), [[Real-time Transport Protocol]] (RTP) and the [[Real-time Transport Control Protocol]] (RTCP) were specifically designed to stream media over networks. RTSP runs over a variety of transport protocols, while the latter two are built on top of UDP.\n\nAnother approach that seems to incorporate both the advantages of using a standard web protocol and the ability to be used for streaming even live content is [[adaptive bitrate streaming]]. HTTP adaptive bitrate streaming is based on HTTP [[progressive download]], but contrary to the previous approach, here the files are very small, so that they can be compared to the streaming of packets, much like the case of using RTSP and RTP.<ref>Ch. Z. Patrikakis, N. Papaoulakis, Ch. Stefanoudaki, M. S. Nunes, \"Streaming content wars: Download and play strikes back\" presented at the Personalization in Media Delivery Platforms Workshop, [218 \u2013 226], Venice, Italy, 2009.</ref> Reliable protocols, such as the [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP), guarantee correct delivery of each bit in the media stream. However, they accomplish this with a system of timeouts and retries, which makes them more complex to implement. It also means that when there is data loss on the network, the media stream stalls while the protocol handlers detect the loss and retransmit the missing data. Clients can minimize this effect by buffering data for display. While delay due to buffering is acceptable in video on demand scenarios, users of interactive applications such as video conferencing will experience a loss of fidelity if the delay caused by buffering exceeds 200&nbsp;ms.<ref>Krasic, C. and Li, K. and Walpole, J., ''The case for streaming multimedia with TCP'', Lecture Notes in Computer Science, pages 213\u2013218, Springer, 2001</ref> \n[[File:Multicast stream.svg|thumb|Multicasting broadcasts the same copy of the multimedia over the entire network to a group of clients]]\n\n[[Unicast]] protocols send a separate copy of the media stream from the server to each recipient. Unicast is the norm for most Internet connections, but does not scale well when many users want to view the same [[television program]] concurrently. [[Multicast]] protocols were developed to reduce the server/network loads resulting from duplicate data streams that occur when many recipients receive unicast content streams independently. These protocols send a single stream from the source to a group of recipients. Depending on the network infrastructure and type, multicast transmission may or may not be feasible. One potential disadvantage of multicasting is the loss of [[video on demand]] functionality. Continuous streaming of radio or television material usually precludes the recipient's ability to control playback. However, this problem can be mitigated by elements such as caching servers, digital [[set-top box]]es, and buffered [[Media player (application software)|media players]].\n\n[[IP Multicast]] provides a means to send a single media stream to a group of recipients on a [[computer network]]. A multicast protocol, usually [[Internet Group Management Protocol]], is used to manage delivery of multicast streams to the groups of recipients on a LAN. One of the challenges in deploying IP multicast is that routers and firewalls between LANs must allow the passage of packets destined to multicast groups. If the organization that is serving the content has control over the network between server and recipients (i.e.,&nbsp;educational, government, and corporate [[intranet]]s), then routing protocols such as [[Protocol Independent Multicast]] can be used to deliver stream content to multiple [[Local Area Network]] segments. As in mass delivery of content, multicast protocols need much less energy and other resources, widespread introduction of reliable multicast (broadcast-like) protocols and their preferential use, wherever possible, is a significant ecological and economic challenge.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} [[Peer-to-peer]] (P2P) protocols arrange for prerecorded streams to be sent between computers. This prevents the server and its network connections from becoming a bottleneck. However, it raises technical, performance, security, quality, and business issues.\n\n==Applications and marketing==\n{{Expand section|date=December 2016}}\nUseful \u2013 and typical \u2013 applications of the \"streaming\" concept are, for example, long [[video lesson|video lectures]] performed \"online\" on the Internet.<ref>A typical one-hour [[video lesson|video lecture]] is the following \"live stream\" from an international conference on [[financial crisis|financial crises]]: [http://videolectures.net/eccs08_stanley_aosptucs/ /videolectures.net]</ref> An advantage of this presentation is that these lectures can be very long, although they can always be interrupted or repeated at arbitrary places. There are also new marketing concepts. For example, the [[Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra]] sells Internet live streams of whole concerts, instead of several [[CD]]s or similar fixed media, by their so-called \"[[Digital Concert Hall]]\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalconcerthall.com/|title=The Berliner Philharmoniker's Digital Concert Hall|website=Digital Concert Hall}}</ref> using [[YouTube]] for \"[[trailer (promotion)|trailing]]\" purposes only. These \"online concerts\" are also spread over a lot of different places \u2013 cinemas \u2013 at various places on the globe. A similar concept is used by the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in New York.
